we study the d-brane spectrum of n = 2 string orbifold theories using the boundary
state formalism. the construction is carried out for orbifolds with isolated singularities,

non-isolated singularities and orbifolds with discrete torsion. our results agree with the

corresponding k-theoretic predictions when they are available and generalize them when

they are not. this suggests that the classication of boundary states provides a sort of

quantum k-theory just as chiral rings in cft provide quantum generalizations of

cohomology. we discuss the identication of these states with d-branes wrapping holo-
morphic cycles in the large radius limit of the cft moduli space. the example c3/z3 is
worked out in full detail using local mirror symmetry techniques. we nd a precise corre-

spondence between fractional branes at the orbifold point and congurations of d-branes
described by vector bundles on the exceptional p2 cycle.

1. introduction

the realization that d-branes [1] carry ramond-ramond charge [2] has been a crucial

ingredient in recent progress in nonperturbative string theory. the simple cft description

of these states as hyperplanes on which open strings can end has provided new insights

in the structure of space-time at substringy length scales [3] and has given an adequate

framework for attempting a microscopic formulation [4] of m-theory. however, there are

many vacua of string theory which do not admit a clear space-time interpretation they are

described by an abstract cft  and for which the description of d-branes is not manifest.

moreover, these vacua are expected to contain nonperturbative states carrying ramond-

ramond charge and to t in the web of dualities relating the dierent string theories. it is

therefore important to describe d-branes in general string vacua and at generic points of

moduli space, where a space-time interpretation might not be obvious, in order to unravel

the complete description of the physics of m-theory.

a powerful tool for analyzing the inclusion of boundaries on string worldsheets is the

boundary state formalism [5]. this formalism provides a closed string description of d-

branes and it is applicable, in principle, to arbitrary cfts. in this vein, one can tackle

the question of determining the d-brane spectrum at an arbitrary point of moduli space

of string theory. along dierent lines, witten [6] has argued that the classication of

d-branes in a general space-time background has to be upgraded from singular homology

to k-theory. this generalization has brought to light a new understanding of d-branes

and the appearance of new hitherto unsuspected states. we strongly believe that the

classication of boundary states of a given cft provides a stringy generalization of k-

theory and that its study should provide a sort of quantum k-theory just as cft chiral

rings generalized cohomology to quantum cohomology [7]. some hints of this will appear

in this work. moreover, the understanding of d-branes at a generic point in moduli space

and d-geometry should shed new light on what space-time at the shortest length scales

really is.

in this paper we classify d-brane states at certain points of the moduli space of type ii

strings with eight supercharges. in particular we provide a boundary state description of d-
brane states at points in moduli space that admit a perturbative orbifold cft description1.

this gives a closed string description of the fractional d-branes in [9,10,11,12]. as a

byproduct of the construction of consistent boundary states, we give a physical d-brane

1 some previous work on boundary states and orbifolds can be found in [8].

proof of the mckay correspondence [13-20]. roughly speaking, this correspondence states

that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the number of non-trivial irreducible
representations of the orbifold group  describing the isolated orbifold singularity cd/

and the homology generators of the crepant resolution of the singularity. in section 5 this

will be explained in the more precise language of k-theory. in our physical situation, this

follows from a deformation of the bps spectrum determined by boundary states to the

large radius limit of the orbifold moduli space where the states can be realized as d-branes

wrapping supersymmetric cycles. we also analyze boundary states for certain non-isolated

singularities and nd that d-brane considerations suggest a generalization of the mckay

correspondence to this case. this would relate non-trivial irreducible representations of

the discrete group to compact homology generators of the resolved space.

the reduced amount of supersymmetry of these vacua introduces corrections to the

special geometry of the moduli space, which makes the abovementioned identication very

dicult.
in section 5 we work out an example by providing the exact solution for the
c3/z3 model using the techniques of local mirror symmetry [21,22,23,24]. we identify the
singularities in moduli space, the monodromies around these points and the exact central

charge for the model. this allows us to make a precise identication between boundary

states at the orbifold point with branes in the large volume limit. moreover, the fractional

branes at the orbifold are extended to an arbitrary point in moduli space. similar results

for the quintic moduli space have been obtained in [25]. the role of the perturbative

orbifold point is played there by the gepner point.

the boundary state formalism serves very useful in analyzing the spectrum of models

that do not have an obvious geometrical interpretation such as orbifolds with discrete tor-

sion [26,27]. we construct the consistent set of boundary states corresponding to fractional

branes for models with discrete torsion and nd that these are classied by irreducible

projective representations of the discrete group. since orbifolds in this class do not ad-

mit complete smooth resolutions, there is no obvious geometric interpretation similar to

mckay correspondence. the ease by which the boundary states generalize to these models

indeed suggest that the most general framework for d-branes is the boundary state for-

malism. in certain situations, this conformal eld theory construction reduces to a known

mathematical structure such as cohomology or k-theory. we believe that this is also the

case for orbifolds with discrete torsion, where the fractional branes should be described by

an appropriate generalization of equivariant k-theory [6].

2

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we summarize the description of

fractional branes at orbifold singularities and some of their properties from a d-brane

probe perspective. in section 3 we give a selfcontained discussion of boundary states and

construct the boundary states in at space and set up the notation. in section 4 we give

the general prescription required to write down boundary states for perturbative orbifold

cfts and give a general argument which predicts the number of states. we then go on

and explicitly work out examples involving orbifolds with isolated singularities, with non-

isolated singularities and with discrete torsion. in section 5 we elucidate the role of these

boundary states and their relation to d-brane states at the large volume limit, and explain

how the boundary state construction sheds new light onto the mckay correspondence. in
section 6 we consider the c3/z3 example and work out the exact solution of the model
including worldsheet instanton corrections. we then make a precise mapping between

fractional branes and d-branes in the large volume limit. we also extend these states

to generic points in moduli space. in the appendix we summarize conventions and some

useful formulas.

2. branes at orbifold singularities and fractional branes

the gauge theory on a d-brane probe reproduces the space-time in which it is em-

bedded as its moduli space of vacua.

it also captures many features of the space-time

bps states which correspond to wave functions on the moduli space of the brane. when

the brane theory is known, this can be an ecient tool in addressing dynamical problems.

hence, in these situations, it is very useful to establish an explicit correspondence between

eld theory and space-time excitations. a very rich background for testing these ideas is

given by orbifold singularities with a perturbative conformal eld theory description. in

this section we will give a brief presentation of d-particle states in orbifold theories of the
form cd/,   su (d), from the probe perspective. the following sections will contain a
more detailed description of the same states using the boundary state formalism.

the theory on d-branes probing a cd/ singularity is uniquely determined by choos-
ing a representation of 2 , which denes the action on the chan-paton indices, and by
specifying an action of  on cd via a d-dimensional representation r. the bosonic pro-

2 we will consider supersymmetric backgrounds so that  is a discrete subgroup of su (d).

of the d-brane theory is the commutant of  in u (n ), where n = pn
da = dim(a), which yields a g = qn

describes the physics of branes at the singularity.

although this formalism is very general, in the following we specialize to d0-brane

quantum mechanics. in the born oppenheimer approximation, the moduli space of vacua

has two branches with dierent space-time interpretation. the higgs branch  spanned
by the expectation values of the elds z  reproduces the orbifold geometry. from a

dynamical point of view, excitations propagating along this branch correspond to d0-

branes that can move about the singularity. the theory also has a coulomb branch
parameterized by expectation values of the elds i in the vector multiplet, the z being

set to zero. the excitations along the coulomb branch have been interpreted in [9,10,11,12]

as branes wrapping the shrunken cycles of the orbifold singularity. there is a one-to-one

correspondence between such bps states and irreducible representations of the orbifold

group . if we resolve the orbifold singularity by turning on marginal operators, the same

states can be identied with branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles in a smooth space-

time background. this can be thought of as a physical mckay correspondence and it will

be considered in more detail later.

these states carry charge under the untwisted, as well as twisted rr elds. the

values of the charges can be determined by an open string disk computation as outlined

in [28,11]. the state corresponding to the a-th irreducible representation has charge

(2.4)

with respect to the m-th twisted rr eld, where a(gm) = tr(a(gm)) is the character of
the a-th representation. note that the d0-brane charge (2.3) is fractional.

a similar analysis can be made for orbifolds with discrete torsion. as shown in [29,30],

discrete torsion can be incorporated in the probe gauge theory by considering chan-paton

factors in a projective representation of the gauge group. the cocycle factors appearing

in the orbifold conformal eld theory partition function [26,27] are representatives of a
cohomology class in h 2(, u (1)).

it can be shown using the methods of [31], that all discrete subgroups of su (2)
have trivial u (1)-valued cohomology, so discrete torsion cannot be implemented in c2/
orbifolds3. nontrivial examples can be found for   su (3) acting on c3. given  
su (3) with non-trivial h 2(, u (1)), and a set of cocycle factors dening the discrete

torsion, the gauge theory on the d-brane probe is found by solving (2.1) with a projective

action of the orbifold group on chan-paton factors. the choice of a cohomology class
in h 2(, u (1))  specifying the discrete torsion phases  determines a class of irreducible

projective representations of  modulo projective equivalence. within this class, there
are in general m 6= 1 (linear equivalence classes of) irreducible projective representations.
b=1 u (nb) just as before. an important
dierence here is that the number of projective representations, m, is not linked anymore

these determine the gauge group to be g = qm

with the number of conjugacy classes of . the gauge theory probe has again m bps states

on the coulomb branch. however, since the resolution of these orbifolds is not complete in

string theory [27,29,30], these states cannot be given a clear geometric interpretation. we

believe that they can be given nevertheless an appropriate boundary state and k-theoretic

interpretation, but we will return to this later on.

in the next sections we will construct all these states using the boundary state for-

malism and reproduce their known properties extracted from the probe theory approach.

3. d-branes as boundary states

in the next section we will construct boundary states corresponding to the fractional

branes introduced in the previous discussion. for completeness we introduce here the

construction of boundary states in at space and set up the notation.

3 this can also be easily seen by showing that all discrete subgroups of su (2) do not admit
non-trivial projective representations and taking into account the relation between h 2(, u (1))
and classes of projective representations mentioned below.

3.1. general construction

boundary states describe in the closed string theory language the inclusion of bound-

aries on the worldsheet [5]. on these boundaries, conformally invariant boundary condi-

tions are imposed on the worldsheet closed string elds. the eigenstates of these boundary

conditions are called ishibashi states. consistency of factorization with the open string

channel [32] select appropriate linear combinations of ishibashi states, which are called

boundary states. boundary states provide a complementary description of d-branes, which

have a simple open string description when a space-time interpretation is available. it is

therefore important to analyze boundary states for generic cfts since many vacua of

string theory do not admit a clear space-time interpretation.

the non-linear constraints imposed by conformal invariance on ishibashi states are

usually solved by replacing them by linear constraints. the cylinder amplitude describing

propagation of a boundary state into another must admit an open string interpretation as

a one loop vacuum amplitude with integer degeneracy of states at any given mass level.

this constraint, usually referred as cardys condition [32], severely restricts the allowed

linear combinations of ishibashi states.

for a general cft with a boundary, conservation of momentum across the boundary

imposes the following condition

tl(t, )|t=0 = tr(t, )|t=0,

(3.1)

which relates the left-moving and right-moving stress energy tensors of the bulk cft

at the t = 0 boundary. for a cft with a more general left-right symmetric chiral algebra
a than the virasoro algebra, one may identify the extra symmetry generators on the left
with those on the right at the boundary up to the action of an automorphism of a4. for
the cft describing string theory in at space-time, vanishing of momentum along the
boundary requires5

tt|t=0 = tx m xm + iem +em  im m|t=0 = 0,

which is satised by imposing the linear conditions

m = 0, . . . , 9

we have constructed the ishibashi states for the at space-vacuum. we will now

construct consistent boundary states. these states must be invariant under all the sym-

metries of the closed string cft and must factorize via a modular transformation on the

cylinder amplitude. that is, the open string one loop cylinder amplitude with a given set

of boundary conditions must agree with the answer that results from propagation in the

such that the open string time t and the closed time l are related by t = 1/2l. the

boundary states must satisfy the gso projection of the underlying string theory they are

embedded in. therefore, they must satisfy

(3.17)

follows that the action on the ishibashi states (3.7) is

matrix so that (1)f a = a(1)f and (1)f r = r(1)f and similarly for the
nsns is odd under both (1)f and (1)ef , it
right movers. furthermore, since |, k >(0)
(1)ef|, k>nsns= |  , k>nsns ,

(1)f|, k>nsns= |  , k>nsns

(3.18)

so that the gso invariant combination in the nsns sector is

(|+>nsns |>nsns )

using (3.7)(3.11)(3.15) one gets for the rr sector

(3.20)

and

(1)ef|, k>rr= |  , k>rr p odd

(1)ef|, k>rr= |  , k>rr p even.

(3.21)

therefore, invariance under (1)f in the rr sector yields the following linear combination

1
2

(|+>rr +|>rr).

(3.22)

imposing the right moving gso invariance of (3.17) restricts p to be odd for the type iib

superstring and p even for the type iia superstring just as expected for supersymmetric
branes9.

we must further impose factorizability with the open string calculation. the open

so that the powers of closed string time in (3.27) match.

there is a heuristic way of anticipating which set of matrix elements of boundary

state components result in the various terms in (3.27). we can think of the r sector of

the open string as a twisted sector of the ns sector when we go around . moreover, the
insertion of (1)f in the trace is a twist in the t direction. now, since the roles of t and
 are exchanged in the closed string channel, we can make the following identications11

after introducing the necessary ingredients we are now ready to discuss the realization

of fractional branes in orbifold backgrounds.

4. fractional branes and boundary states

we will use the open string interpretation of the cylinder amplitude to classify the
consistent set of supersymmetric boundary states corresponding to d-branes at a c3/

12 we can easily obtain the expression for an anti-d-brane by changing the sign of the rr

contribution to the boundary state.

singularity. we will analyze branes that are point-like in the orbifold direction and in the

transverse space.

an open string in this background suers identications which follow from the action

of .  acts both on the coordinates along the orbifold and on the end-points of the

string. the action on the coordinates is given by the action of  on the 3 of su (3). the

action on the chan-paton factors is determined by choosing a representation of  as in

the gauge theory discussion. therefore, a general one loop open string amplitude can be

obtained from a set of n cylinder amplitudes obtained by acting with the a-th irreducible

representation a, a = 1 . . . , n on the chan-paton factors. therefore, we expect to be
able to construct as many basic consistent boundary states of the c3/ background as the

number of irreducible representations, n, that  admits. the most general boundary state

will admit an expansion in terms of these basic ones.

the a-th open string cylinder amplitude is given by

za =

1

||xgz dt

2t

tr(g

e2tho ),

where ho is the open string hamiltonian. this amplitude can be written as

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

where a is the character of the a-th irreducible representation of  and

za =

as mentioned above, these open string amplitudes should have an interpretation as prop-

agation between boundary states. in this case proper factorization demands that

z dl a<b|elhc|b>a= za.

(4.4)

we will see in dierent examples how this identication works and explicitly construct the
boundary states |b>a.

since we are interested in branes that look point-like in the orbifold direction and in

the transverse space, the boundary conditions that we will impose on the closed string

worldsheet elds are the ones in (3.6) with p = 0. a proper linear combination of solutions

has to be formed such that the boundary states are gso invariant,  invariant and factorize

13

properly in the open string channel (4.4). the presence of the orbifold forces us to consider

solutions to (3.6) in all twisted sectors of the closed string. therefore, the full boundary

state associated with the a-th irreducible representation in the open string channel is

formed as a linear combination of boundary states in the n string sectors

|b>a=

1
n

n1xm=0

|b, m>a

(4.5)

we shall see that the matrix elements involving |b, m >a yield the open string answer
when the corresponding group element is inserted in the open string trace. these bound-
ary states carry charges under twisted sector vertex operators |s > as measured by the
overlap <s|b>a. in particular they carry charge under twisted rr elds and as we will
see with precisely the correct value as the corresponding fractional brane in the probe

theory approach. we will now consider several examples including orbifolds with isolated

singularities, non-isolated singularities and discrete torsion.

4.1. c3/zn orbifold

we will rst compute the open string cylinder amplitudes that the boundary states

must reproduce. the action of the zn generator g on the worldsheet elds is implemented
by

g = exp

2i

n (a1s1+a2s2+a3s3),

(4.6)

where (s1, s2, s3) are vectors in the so(6) weight lattice corresponding to c3. it is therefore
useful to introduce three complex coordinates and their complex conjugate which describe

the orbifold

4.2. boundary states in c3/zn

we will now show that the term in the open string partition function with gm inserted

in the trace (4.13) is reproduced by taking the solutions of (3.6) in the m-th twisted sector

of the closed string and constructing the corresponding coherent states in the rr and

nsns sector.

the untwisted sector solutions to (3.6) are identical to those in at space just dis-

cussed. however, we must also make sure that the boundary state we write down is

zn invariant. it is therefore convenient to write the ishibashi states using the complex
coordinates (4.8). then14,

for the right movers15. written in this form it is clear that the exponential is neutral

under the action of zn since each oscillator appears multiplying a complex conjugate one.
furthermore, using (4.6) and the explicit expressions for the vacua we see that in fact the

full set of ishibashi states (4.14) are zn invariant in the untwisted sector. therefore the
expression reproducing the open string result without any zn element in the trace (4.12)
is (3.31) with

(4.15)

in closed string theory the string can be closed up to an action of gm. this sector of the

string is usually referred to the m-twisted sector. it is easy to see that in a twisted sector
in the c3/zn
example it is easy to see from the mode expansions in the appendix that the modied

the modding of the oscillators along the orbifold directions get shifted.

14 we introduce another label for the boundary states which describes the sector of closed string

oscillators we use.

with the rest of (anti)commutators vanishing. moreover, the orbifold action projects out

the bosonic and fermionic zero modes along the orbifold directions since twisted sector

states are stuck at the origin of the singularity. technically, we have to perform the same

construction as in at space. the boundary conditions to be solved are those in (3.6) with

the shifted oscillators in the orbifold directions

are expected. even though the orbifold action leaves xed only the origin, in order to get

a modular invariant closed string partition function, we must multiply the contribution

from a given twisted sector by the xed point degeneracy that the orbifold would have if
it were toroidal. now, for toroidal orbifolds, the number of xed of the group element gm

is given by lefschetz xed-point theorem

det(1  gm) = 64

sin2(mi),

(4.24)

as can be shown using the dening action (4.6), and (4.23) contains the square root of this.

the charges carried by the boundary state can be computed by inserting the corre-

sponding vertex operator. thus, the charge vector of these states is made out of untwisted

d0-brane charge and the twisted rr charges. the state that represents a d0-brane is the

one made with the regular representation. since the character of the regular representation

is non-trivial only for the identity element, it is clear that the corresponding boundary state

is charged only under the untwisted rr one-form as expected from the probe theory con-

siderations. the d0-brane charge of the above states built on an irreducible representation

is

qa

0 = 1/n

a = 1, . . . , n.

(4.25)

these boundary states also carry charges under the rr twisted sectors. the charge under

the m-th such sector can be easily computed to be

qa

m =

a(gm)

n

a = 1, . . . , n,

(4.26)

as expected from the disk computation.

we have constructed all the boundary states corresponding to fractional branes for

this orbifold. any other supersymmetric d-brane state can be constructed out of these

basic ones. these states can be identied in the large volume limit of the orbifold cft

moduli space with d-branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles.

this is an isolated singularity. there are (n  1)(n  2) elements of this group that x
the origin. the contribution to the partition function with these group elements or the

identity in the trace (4.3) is identical to that in the previous example (4.10)(4.11) with the
substitutions k1  p, k2  q and k3  (p + q). therefore the modular transform is
(4.12)(4.13).

there are 3(n  1) group elements that x a line. the contribution of these group
elements to the open string partition function can be accounted for by adding three copies

it is easy to construct the boundary states describing fractional branes for this vacuum.

technically, the only dierence is the use of projective representations, and therefore the

appearance of modied characters in the open string computation. once the discrete
torsion cocycles are chosen  h 2(zn  zn , u (1))  zn , so that there are n  1 nontrivial
cohomology classes  we can construct exactly as in the previous example boundary states

corresponding to fractional branes. however, their number is the number of irreducible

representations in the cocycle class of the discrete torsion phases. within each cocycle

class there is a unique n dimensional irreducible projective representation so that there

is a unique fractional brane.

its charges are those in (4.34), (4.35) for a = 1 with the

modied character of the projective representation.

5. geometric interpretation

the construction of bps d-particle states has been so far restricted to exactly solv-

able orbifold theories, where the boundary state approach proved to be a powerful tool.

however, orbifold theories admit exactly marginal deformations which give rise to a mod-

uli space. this fact leads to a natural question, namely how does the bps spectrum

21

behave under these perturbations? although a precise answer may depend on the par-

ticular aspects of each model, we will outline the general expected behavior and establish

connections to singularity theory and mckay correspondence. in the next section, we will
treat the case of c3/z3 in detail, as in illustration of the principles outlined below. since
the eect of marginal deformations is very dierent in theories with and without discrete

torsion, we start the discussion with conventional orbifolds. the case with discrete torsion

will be considered at the end of the section.

in the absence of discrete torsion, the marginal operators correspond to blow-up modes

of the singularity, parameterizing the kahler moduli space of the resolved space [21]. more-

over, by adjusting the coecients of the perturbations, we can eventually reach a region

in the moduli space where the resulting exceptional cycles are very large and classical ge-

ometry is a good approximate description of the theory. assuming that the bps spectrum

can be continuously deformed to this region with no jumping phenomena, we expect the

orbifold states to be realized as d-branes wrapped on supersymmetric cycles in a smooth

space-time background. note that in this regime, there is no exact conformal eld theory

description, but the supergravity approximation is valid. therefore we would obtain two

dierent realizations of the same spectrum of bps states. the assumption that jumping

phenomena are absent is automatically satised in space-time theories with sixteen super-

charges. in theories with eight supercharges, where this phenomenon is present, we simply

assume that there is a path connecting the orbifold point to the large radius limit that

avoids the curves of marginal stability.

for isolated singularities, carrying out this program is in fact equivalent to a physical

realization of the celebrated mckay correspondence [13-20], as we now explain. loosely,

we can think of supersymmetric states in the large radius limit as d-branes wrapping

supersymmetric cycles in space-time. the homology of the resolved space is even and

generated by holomorphic cycles, which are supersymmetric. at the same time, the orbifold

boundary states are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible representations of

the orbifold group. therefore, the deformation of bps states eectively gives a map

between the irreducible representations of the orbifold group and homology classes of the

resolution. this would be a physical realization of the mckay correspondence.

a more precise formulation18 can be achieved by interpreting the d0-brane states as k-

18 this paragraph is somewhat abstract and it is not essential for understanding the rest of the

paper.

22

theory classes [37,6]. in the present context, d-brane states in an orbifold x/ are classied

by the equivariant k-theory k(x) with compact support of the covering space [6,38,39].
a standard result [40] shows that k(x) is isomorphic to the representation group r() of
the discrete group  generated by its irreducible representations. as mentioned before, this

is in agreement with the boundary state construction. in the large radius limit, the d-brane

states are classied similarly by a k-theory group supported on the exceptional divisor d

of the resolved space ex. more precisely, the relevant k group k0(ex) can be dened as

the grothendieck group of bounded complexes of algebraic vector bundles supported on
the exceptional locus19 [40,41]. the relevance of this k-theory group in the context of

d-branes on orbifolds and more general algebraic varieties has been discussed in [39,42].

of coherent sheaves of the exceptional divisor d. when d is smooth, k(d) is generated

by classes of vector bundles. in this framework, the deformation of bps states will give a

it can also be showed that k0(ex) is isomorphic to the usual grothendieck group k(d)
map between the k-theory groups k(x) and k0(ex). this is a more precise formulation

of the mckay correspondence [14,15,20].

in practice, deforming the spectrum of bps states along the moduli space can be quite

dicult, especially in theories with eight supercharges which exhibit quantum corrections.
the c3/z3 example studied in the next section illustrates the complexity of the problem.
for technical reasons, the above discussion has been restricted to isolated singularities.

however, as detailed in section 3.3, the boundary state construction works as well for

nonisolated singularities. we have showed that the fractional branes are again classied
by the irreducible representations of the orbifold group. therefore, in the c3/zn  zn
orbifold treated there, we have (n 2  1) independent boundary states. the number of
homology cycles of the exceptional locus can be computed using either conformal eld

theory techniques or toric methods. the abstract cft hodge diamond is [30]

19 this construction can be realized both in algebraic and topological setting, resulting in

consider here the algebraic approach.

23

therefore, there seems to be a mismatch with the number of irreducible representations.

which is in agreement with the number of fractional branes. the same result can be

obtained by constructing toric resolutions. this suggests that the map between represen-

tations of the orbifold group and cycles of the resolution can be extended to this case, at

least in the d-brane picture. it would be interesting to give a more precise description of

this map, but we leave this for future work.

finally, the case of orbifolds with discrete torsion is notably dierent. the exactly

marginal operators correspond to complex structure deformations, as opposed to kahler

blow-up modes. moreover, turning on these operators does not completely resolve the

singularity [27,43,9,30]. therefore, the fractional branes cannot be given a clear geomet-

ric interpretation. we believe that these states can be mathematically described in an

appropriate k-theoretic formalism, but we will not attempt to develop this here.

6. fractional branes in the c3/z3 orbifold

the purpose of this section is to carry out the program outlined above for the c3/z3
orbifold. the moduli space of deformations can be thought as the kahler moduli space
of a noncompact calabi-yau threefold with a p2 cycle shrinking to zero size [21,44]. as

usual in (2, 2) superconformal models, the classical geometry is corrected by world-sheet

instantons whose eects can be exactly summed using local mirror symmetry. therefore,

the rst step in our analysis is to describe in detail the exact quantum moduli space. then,

using these exact results, we show how to continuously deform the fractional branes to the

large radius limit.

20 in the computation of the orbifold cohomology performed in the section 2.2 of [30] one has
to remove the 3(n  1) twisted sector (1, 1) classes corresponding to the constant forms of zero

degree along the xed lines. these give rise to non-normalizable forms on the resolved space.

24

6.1. the quantum moduli space

since this is a nonconventional case the threefold being noncompact we have in fact

to use the local version of mirror symmetry developed in [21,22,23,24]. the coecients of

the marginal deformations can be thought as algebraic coordinates on the moduli space

and the exact quantum geometry is described by periods of the local mirror geometry. the

present model has been analyzed to various degrees in [21,44,45,46,24,47]. in the following

we will review the construction of the local mirror model and present a detailed solution.

the results in this subsection have been elaborated in collaboration with albrecht klemm

to whom we are very grateful for valuable help.

the starting point is the linear sigma model construction of the (blown-up) orbifold

background in iia string theory. following [48,10], we consider a two dimensional n = 2

u (1) sigma model with four chiral elds xi, i = 0, . . . , 3 and charge vector

the potential for the scalar elds is therefore

l = (3, 1, 1, 1).

where r is a fayet-iliopoulos parameter. the phase r > 0 corresponds to the blown-up
phase, the exceptional p 2 divisor being described by the coordinates x1, x2, x3 which
cannot vanish simultaneously. in the phase r < 0, x0 cannot vanish and the exceptional

is a noncompact toric variety described by the following noncomplete fan

local mirror symmetry associates to the noncompact toric variety represented in fig.1. a

one dimensional local geometry described by the polynomial equation [23,24]

aiyi = 0

where the variables yi satisfy the constraint equation

where x1, x2, x3 are projective coordinates subject to the c identication (x1, x2, x3) 
(x1, x2, x3). note that there is also an (c)3 action on the space of parameters ai

can be parameterized by the invariant coordinate

the exact solution of the model is provided by a three-dimensional vector of periods

case. this is not the picard-fuchs equation for the periods of the elliptic curve (6.9) which will
enter the discussion later.

(6.12)

this shows that (6.10) has regular singular points at z = 0, 1, . according to the general
theory, rst we have to nd local solutions dened in a neighborhood of each singular point
and then perform analytic continuation. the local solutions will be denoted by f x
i (z) where
x = 0, 1,  labels the singular points and i = 0, 1, 2 labels solutions in a given region. note
that the equation (6.10) admits a constant solution f x
0 = 1 which is dened everywhere.
before presenting the details of the other solutions, we would like to discuss some of their

general properties.

the solutions to the indicial equations at the three singular points are (0, 0, 0) at

z = 0, (0, 1, 1) at z = 1 and(cid:0)0, 1

3 , 2

3(cid:1) at z = . accordingly, we expect the solutions near

z = 0 to be logarithmic. at z = 1 we expect a power series solution with index 1 and a log-
arithmic solution, while at z =  both solutions are expected to be power series involving
fractional powers. therefore we will obtain nontrivial monodromy transformations about
these points. moreover, the fact that all solutions at z =  are power series signals an
exactly solvable conformal eld theory associated to that point. this is the perturbative

orbifold point, similar to the gepner points in the one parameter models considered in

[52,53,54].

in the context of global mirror symmetry, it is known that one can dene a special basis

of solutions such that the monodromy transformations are integral symplectic matrices.
using special coordinates ta on the moduli space, this basis can be written in general as

ta(cid:1) where f (ta) is the n = 2 prepotential. the functions (ta, f

to a symplectic basis of cycles.

in the local case, we have only three periods, therefore we cannot nd a symplectic

basis. this is consistent with the local mirror geometry (6.9) being one dimensional. in

27

fact, as observed in [44,47], the equation (6.10) is the logarithmic integral of an ordinary

hypergeometric equation

3(cid:19)(cid:21) f = 0.

(6.13)

this represents the picard-fuchs equation for the periods of the global holomorphic one-

form on a symplectic basis of cycles of the elliptic curve (6.9). as before, we have regular
singular points at (0, 1, ), the monodromy group being isomorphic to (3) [55]. therefore
we can dene a special basis of solutions of the form (1, t(z), td(z)) [47] such that the
monodromy transformations are integral 3  3 matrices of the form

(cid:20)

0

m m(cid:21) .

(6.14)

here m  (3) represents the (3) monodromy acting on (t, td) which are logarithmic
integrals of the solutions of (6.13). the integral column vector m reects the fact that the

periods (t, td) may pick up constant shifts when analytically continued about the singular
points. this will play an important role at a latter stage. we now derive explicit formulae

for the local solutions and determine the monodromy.

(6.22)

note that the above solutions are absolutely convergent in the region |z| < 1.

if
|z| = 1 the series are convergent for z 6= 1. however, the simple logarithmic solution (6.15)
diverges at z = 1, which is a singular point similar to the conifold point in the quintic

moduli space [52]. this singular point will play an important role in determining the

integral basis of solutions (1, t, td). according to [47], the coordinate t can be identied
with the simple logarithmic solution (6.16). more precisely, we will take

t(z) =

1
2i

f 0
1 (z).

(6.23)

the dual period td = f
point z = 1 and analytically continuing the vanishing period [52].

t can be found by studying the system of solutions near the singular

ii)solutions at z = 1.

30

a basis of solutions near this singular point can be found by changing variables u =

1  z in (6.10). this results in the following dierential equation

(6.24)

which can be solved with standard recursive methods (see for example [55].) as mentioned

before, the solutions of the indicial equation are (0, 1, 1), therefore one of the solutions

should be a power series of index one, while the second solution should be logarithmic. it

can be shown [47] that the logarithmic solution is given by the analytic continuation of

the period t(z) to z = 1

the function

t(u) = 3td(u)log(u) + o(1).

these solutions are well dened and convergent if || < 1 and |arg()| < .

it follows that the analytic continuation of the periods (t, td) in a neighborhood of 

reads

2i

where  = e

and taking into account the fact that

3 . this can be proved by direct computation using (6.23), (6.27), and (6.20)
42 . note that the values of the

3 )

periods at the singular point are

t ( = 0) = 0,

td ( = 0) =

1
3

.

(6.31)

once we know the local solutions near each singular point, the global solution can

be obtained by patching them together. since the periods are multivalued functions, this

process requires branch cuts in the complex plane. these are implicit in the restrictions

imposed on the phase of z in the paragraphs following (6.15) and (6.29) which represent
two branch cuts joining z = 0 and z = 1 and respectively z = 1 and z =  along the real
axis. this will allow us to assign unambiguous values of the periods to all points in the

moduli space (away from the cuts).

iv)monodromy.

the monodromy of the integral basis of solutions around the singular points can be de-

termined from the explicit local solutions derived above. by performing a counterclockwise

rotation about each of the three singular points, we nd

m0 =

1 0
1 1

m1 =

m =

(6.32)

satisfying m = m1m0. note that m0 and m1 are of innite order and they agree with
the expected behavior of the periods in the innite volume limit and respectively at the

conifold point. however, m is of third order, reecting the quantum z3 symmetry of
the orbifold point as explained in [21]. this identies the orbifold point as a quotient

singularity in the moduli space.

6.2. fractional branes and bps states on the moduli space

we now show how to use the above detailed solution in order to relate the orbifold

fractional branes to the generic bps states on the moduli space. this will allow us to

32

deform this states along a path between the orbifold point and the large radius limit and

to nally interpret them as macroscopic branes on supersymmetric cycles.

in order to carry out this program, we need to know the form of the complexied
kahler class tb  b + ij in terms of the exact periods (1, t, td). this is essentially the
problem of nding a precise form of the mirror map. according to the properties of the

monomial-divisor map as discussed for example in [44], the asymptotic form of tb is

tb 

1
2i

z

27(cid:17) + o(z).
since the period t has an asymptotic behavior  log(cid:0) z
an integration constant which depends on the choice of sign of z/27 inside the logarithm.
it has been argued in [44] that this sign should be positive and c was xed to  1

27(cid:1) this xes tb = t + c, where c is

log(cid:16)

(6.33)

2

tb = t 

1
2

.

(6.34)

with this choice for the mirror map, the quantum volume of the p1 cycle in the exceptional

divisor is positive everywhere on the moduli space. in particular the value of tb at the
orbifold point in 1/2.

note that, in the basis (1, tb, td), the monodromy matrices will no longer be integral
since tb and td are shifted by half integral numbers. therefore, the bps states will be
represented with respect to the basis (1, tb, td) by charge vectors (n0, n1, n2) where n1, n2
are integral and n0 is half integral. the associated central charge is

z(n0, n1, n2) = n0 + n1tb + n2td.

(6.35)

our rst goal is to identify the charge vectors associated with the three boundary states

constructed in the previous section. then, using analytic continuation to the large radius

limit, we will interpret the resulting bps states as d-branes wrapped on cycles.

the rst step is to note that the perturbative c3/z3 orbifold cft has a z3 quantum
symmetry [21] which permutes the twist elds cyclically. taking into account the boundary

state construction in the previous sections, the quantum z3 also permutes the fractional
branes in a similar manner. therefore all boundary states, associated with the three irre-

ducible representations of z3 1, 2 and 3, form an orbit of the discrete global symmetry
group. changing perspective, the same quantum symmetry manifests itself in the form of

a third order monodromy of periods on the moduli space as explained in [21] and in the

previous paragraph. from here we conclude that the fractional branes are naturally in

33

one to one correspondence with a set of three periods forming an orbit of the monodromy

generator m.

the next available piece of information is that all fractional branes have equal mass,

which is 1/3 of the mass of a d0-brane. at the same time the formula (6.31) shows that
this is precisely the mass of a state with charges (0, 0, 1) at the orbifold. therefore we
will identify the three fractional branes with the following states24

(0, 0, 1),

(cid:18) 1

2

, 1, 1(cid:19) ,

(cid:18) 1

2

, 1, 2(cid:19)

(6.36)

obtained by acting25 by the monodromy generator m. the corresponding central charges
read

z(0, 0, 1) = td,

z(cid:18) 1

2

, 1, 1(cid:19) =

1
2

+ tb + td,

z(cid:18) 1

2

, 1, 2(cid:19) =

1
2  tb  2td. (6.37)

clearly, all states have mass equal to 1/3 of the d0-brane mass which is normalized to one.

in order to complete the analysis, we have to understand if the proposed bps states

have a well dened d-brane interpretation in the large radius limit. although the periods

can be continued along any given path joining the two points, the continuation of the

bps states is more subtle due to the possible jumping phenomena. this phenomenon and

the associated marginal stability curves have been studied intensively in the context of

seiberg-witten solutions [56,57,58]. in the present case, note that all periods have real

values at the orbifold point, therefore all marginal stability curves will necessarily pass

through that point. therefore, as long as the curves are reasonably shaped (that is if they

have no self intersection), it is possible to nd a path between the orbifold point and the

large radius limit that avoids them. in the following we will assume that this is in fact the

case and that there exists such a path along which the states (6.36) are stable. the nal

result will be shown to be consistent with this assumption.

24 the above arguments do not x the sign of the charges. we have chosen the sign so that

the three states will have a total d0-brane charge 1 rather than 1, as it will be clear latter. a

dierent choice of sign would correspond to antiparticle states.

25 note that the monodromy matrices act on the charge vectors by right multiplication and on

the period vectors by left multiplication.

the asymptotic expansion of the central charges of the three bps states reads

z(0, 0, 1) =

the corresponding d-brane states can be identied by comparing (6.38) to the

semiclassical expression for the central charge of a state with eective d-brane charges

(q0, q2, q4)

z(q0, q2, q4) = q4

t2
b
2

+ q2tb + q0.

(6.39)

note that, according to the discussion in section four, the d-brane states are classied
by the k-theory group k(d), where d  p2 is the exceptional divisor. the vector q =
(q0, q2, q4) takes values in the total cohomology space h 4 (d, q) h 2 (d, q) h 0 (d, q)
and it measures the eective charges of a brane conguration represented by a given k-

theory class. we consider rational cohomology since the eective charges may be fractional.

given a k-theory class represented by a vector bundle (or, more generally, a coherent

sheaf) v on d, we can determine q from the chern-simons couplings found in [59,60,61].

a careful analysis of these couplings, taking into account the twisting of the worldvolume

fermions in normal directions, has been performed by cheung and yin in [62]. they show

that, the vector of induced charges for a system of dp-branes wrapping a supersymmetric

cycle d is given by

q = ch(v )s a(td)

a(nd)

.

(6.40)

here td and nd denote the tangent and respectively the normal bundle to the cycle d.
for the case when d is a holomorphic surface embedded in calabi-yau threefold, we

have [62]

s a(td)

a(nd)

= 1 +

1
48

(p1(nd)  p1(td))

= 1 +

(d)

24

wd

(6.41)

where (d) is the topological euler characteristic of d and wd is the fundamental class.
therefore we obtain

q = r + c1(v ) +(cid:18) r

8

+

1
2

c2

1(v )  c2(v )(cid:19) wd.

35

(6.42)

using this formula, we can show that the d-brane congurations corresponding to the

three central charges (6.38) are

z(0, 0, 1)  d4
z(

, 1, 1)  d4 + d2
, 1, 2)  2d4 + d2 + d0.

z(

(6.43)

in the above, the symbol d4 represents a d4-brane wrapped on the exceptional divisor d
while d2 represents a d2-brane wrapped on a p1  p2 cycle in the hyperplane class h.
barred symbols denote antibrane states which correspond to negative k-theory classes.

these states correspond to the fractional branes at the orbifold.

the rst two congurations are represented by the classes [o(1)] and [o] where
o, o(1) are the trivial and respectively the tautological line bundle on p2. the third
case deserves more attention since it corresponds to a rank 2 holomorphic bundle v on p2

characterized by

r = 2,

c1(v ) = 1,

c2(v ) = 1.

(6.44)

as a consistency check we should now be able to check if the resulting d-brane states are

indeed bps. according to [61], this means that the three bundles should be holomorphic

and stable. these criteria are clearly satised by the rst two line bundles. however, this

is a nontrivial test for the rank 2 bundle v [63,64]. according to the classication therein,

it can be checked that the bundle v in our problem is an exceptional stable holomorphic
bundle on p2. this means that it is holomorphic and stable and it has no deformations i.e.

the moduli space reduces to a single point. it is remarkable that our bps states analysis

has lead precisely to one of these exceptional bundles which form a special discrete series.

moreover, note that both the fractional branes and the d-brane congurations (6.43) have

no moduli. this is in agreement with the arguments of [25] which show that the number

of moduli of the bps states should be preserved under kahler deformations.

to this end, note that there is one more test we can perform. in [30], douglas and

fiol have introduced the index

trhopen(cid:0)(1)f e2tho(cid:1)

(6.45)

that counts the number of fermion zero modes in the ramond open string sector in the

presence of d-brane states. they have also argued on the basis of dirac quantization

36

condition, that this index should actually compute the classical intersection number of

supersymmetric cycles up to sign. more precisely, the index in (6.45) can be given a closed

string interpretation using the formalism of boundary states discussed previously. in fact

(6.45) is related by a modular transformation to the following closed string amplitude

rrhb1|elhc|b2irr

(6.46)

where |b1,2i are two arbitrary boundary states. this formula denes an antisymmetric bi-
linear form on the set of all boundary states which is the equivalent of an intersection form.

in the case of even branes, this seems to lead to a puzzle since the classical intersection

form is symmetric. the resolution resides in the fact that the open string index computes

the intersection form of the branes as seen from the dual mirror point of view [25]. the

exact periods (tb, td) found in the previous subsection, are really sections of a rank two
holomorphic vector bundle e on the moduli space with structure group (3)  sl(2, z).
the charge (n1, n2) vectors of bps states are locally constant sections and we can dene
a natural symplectic form

 : ((n1, n2), (n

1, n

2))  3(n

1n2  n1n
2).

(6.47)

this represents the intersection form on the middle homology of the elliptic curve (6.9).
the coecient 3 has been chosen to agree with the intersection number h  d = 3.

in our situation the index (6.45) can be easily computed at the orbifold point using

conformal eld theory techniques. as noted in [30], it turns out that for a given pair of

fractional branes one actually counts the net number of chiral fermion multiplets in the

rr sector of the open string stretching between the branes which are left invariant by

the orbifold projection. therefore, in the presence of two fractional branes classied by

two irreducible representations a, b, we count the number of chiral fermion multiplets 
satisfying

(g)1

a (g)b = r(g)

(6.48)

where g is a generator of z3 and r is the standard three dimensional representation
dened by embedding in su (3). the result has a concise graphical description encoded in

the quiver diagram corresponding to the regular representation.

given two irreducible representations a, b the (a, b)-th entry of the resulting inter-
section form is given by the number of edges connecting the two vertices. the sign is given

by the orientation of the edges: the contribution is positive if the arrows point from the

antisymmetric intersection form

an elementary computation shows that this agrees with the intersection form (6.47) eval-

uated on the charges (6.36).

in computing open string partition functions and the matrix elements of the boundary

states, it is convenient to introduce the following functions

( ) = q1/24

yn=1

(1  qn)

1(,  ) = 2 exp(i /4) sin()

2(,  ) = 2 exp(i /4) cos()

need the modular properties of  functions
