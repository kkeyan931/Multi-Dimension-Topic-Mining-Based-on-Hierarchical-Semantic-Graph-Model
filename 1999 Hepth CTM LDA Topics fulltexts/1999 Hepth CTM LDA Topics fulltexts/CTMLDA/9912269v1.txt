abstract

we calculate the eective action for quantum electrodynamics
(qed) in d = 2, 3 dimensions at the quadratic approximation in the
gauge elds. we analyse the analytic structure of the corresponding
nonlocal boson propagators nonperturbatively in k/m. in two dimen-
sions for any nonzero fermion mass , we end up with one massless
pole for the gauge boson . we also calculate in d = 2 the eective
potential between two static charges separated by a distance l and
nd it to be a linearly increasing function of l in agreement with the
bosonized theory (massive sine-gordon model). in three dimensions
we nd nonperturbatively in k/m one massive pole in the eective
bosonic action leading to screening. fitting the numerical results we
derive a simple expression for the functional dependence of the boson
mass upon the dimensionless parameter e2/m .

1 introduction

the mapping of fermionic theories into bosonic ones is a very powerful tech-
nique used to understand nonperturbative aspects of quantum eld theories.
this so called bosonization is exact in two dimensional theories, and it has
been widely employed in this dimension [1-3]. in the last few years, many
papers have been devoted to the study of what has been called bosonization
in three dimensions [4-8], and even in four dimensions [9]. this kind of path-
integral bosonization consists of obtaining the eective action by integrating
out the fermion degrees of freedom and then studying the physical proper-
ties of the resulting eective theory. in most of the works along this line one
makes use of the derivative expansion [10, 11] and derives weak bosonization
rules for the system [4, 6, 12] as well as the particle content and their masses
[4]. on the other hand in [5] an exact, in k/m, action at one-loop level is
used to show that the bosonization of [13] and [14], is recovered in the large
and small momentum limits respectively. in addition , the authors of [12]
have studied the assymptotic properties of the bosonic eective action asso-
ciated with qed in three dimensions, showing the screening property of the
eective potential between two static charges.

in this work we apply the eective action approach of bosonization on
qed in two and three dimensions. the usefulness of the two dimensional
case lies on the fact that qed2 can be bosonized via the massive sine-
gordon model which exhibits connement [1, 2, 3]. thus both approaches
of bosonization can be compared. here we verify that, indeed the conning
behavior also appears in the bosonization via eective action. it is remarkable
that in two dimensions at the quadratic approximation in the gauge elds
but without any expansion in k/m, the massive pole of the schwinger model
disappears, being replaced by a massless pole, which is in agreement with
what has been observed in [15] , but it diers from the result obtained through
perturbative ( m/e ) calculation of [16]. in three dimensions it is shown that
there is a massive excitation which depends on the dimensionless parameter
16 m
. we have found a simple approximated expression for this function.
this in fact generalizes the calculations of [4], which were obtained at leading
order of the derivative expansion, and that of [17] carried out at a higher order
in k/m, which in its turn is related to consistent higher derivative actions
[18, 19].

in both cases we consider the one-loop eective action up to second-order

in the coupling constant e. we may write it as

is the polarization tensor obtained after integrating out the fermion elds.
the space-time dimension is represented by d ( d = 2, 3 ). it is useful to
expand the polarization tensor in powers of k
m which corresponds to the
derivative expansion of the eective action [20]. truncating the expansion at
some power of k/m not only yields a local eective action but also allows one
to analyse the role of some specic term as it is the case of the leading odd-
parity term in qed3 [21]. it is also important to study the phenomenological
aspects of a low-energy eective action [22]. the order at which the series is
truncated depends on the range of energy one is interested in.

recent studies of the contributions of higher-order derivative terms in a
low-energy eective gauge theory revealed the possibility of the appearence
of non-physical excitations. here we overcome this diculty by analyzing
directly the poles of the full propagator at one-loop level up to second order
in the coupling constant.

2 eective potential in qed2

in qed2 the polarization tensor will be given by

(k) = (k2) g

where using , e. g. , dimensional regularisation we get

(k2) =

we are interested in the interacting potential between two static charges
q and q located at x = l/2 and x = l/2 . solving1 the equation of
motion derived from the eective action we obtain the potential produced by
the positive charge q :

a(x) = z

is the conserved current and d(k) is the photon propagator whose lon-
gitudinal term is given by

(7)

due to the specic form of the external current the only contribution to
the potential will be its time-component . the corresponding integral can be
easily performed on the complex plane for arbitrary masses . the resulting
static potential at x1 =  l

charges, namely

a0(x =

then we conclude that, at the quadratic approximation used here, qed2
results in a conning potential. because of the quadratic approximation in
the gauge elds we may say that the result obtained here, i.e., a linearly
growing inter-fermion eective potential is due to a zero mass pole for the
gauge potential. one also reaches a similar result in the usual bosonization
approach when the quadratic approximation in the boson eld of the massive
sine-gordon model is used [15].
in other words we can say that, at the
quadratic approximation, turning on a mass for the fermion eld will prevent
the mass generation for the gauge boson and the classical result, that is a
massless pole, prevails.
it is worth mentioning that , since we are only

1 we have not taken into account the general solution of the homogeneous dierential

equation ( without sources ) which amounts to neglect the -vacuum (  = 0 )

interested in the real contribution to the eective action , we have dropped
in (4) the imaginary part of the polarization tensor which appears beyond the
pair creation threshold k2 > 4m2. more specically , expression (4) is correct
for k2 < 0 which is the relevant region for the calculation of the eective
potential of static charges due to the factor (k0) which comes from the time
integral in (5). however, for the analysis of the particle content of (1) we
have also calculated the polarization tensor in the region 0 < k2 < 4m2 where
we found no poles except in the limit k2  0+ where we found an agreement
with the limit k2  0 of (4). finally, it is important to notice that although
we can recover the schwinger model eective action from the m  0 limit
of (4) its static potential does not correspond to the massless limit of (8)
since the integral and the limit do not commute with each other.
in the
schwinger model (massless qed2) a mass for the gauge boson is generated
by the gauge anomaly and as a consequence one obtains a screening potential
between two static charges [23, 24].

3 massive pole in qed3

here we are not concerned with the explicit expression for the interaction po-
tential but with the behavior of the mass generated dynamically as a function
of the coupling constant and the fermion mass.

in this case the polarization tensor is given by

(k) = 1(k2)ik + 2(k2)(cid:16)k2g  kk(cid:17) ,

equations (10) and (11) were obtained by using dimensional regular-
ization method. equation (10) is regularization dependent and our result

5

corresponds to an equal number of pauli-villars regulators with positive and
negative masses. like the two dimensional case , since we are only interested
in the real contribution to the eective action, we have dropped the imagi-
nary part of the polarization tensor which appears beyond the pair creation
threshold ( k2 > 4m2 ). more precisely we have only given the polarization
tensor (see (10) and (11)) in the region 0 < k2 < 4m2 where we found a pole
in the photon propagator. for k2 < 0 the correct result correspond to replace
1ulog((1+u)/(1u)) by 2u arctan 1u in (10) and (11) where u = k2
4m2 .
the situation is similar to qed4 , see , e.g., [26]. we have explicitly veried
that no tachyonic poles appear without any approximation on k2
4m2 . back to
the region 0 < k2 < 4m2 one can check that the photon propagator

(12)

develops a massive pole k2 = m 2. the gauge boson mass m depends on
the coupling constant and fermion mass. we have carried out a numerical
analysis for the behavior of this mass generated dynamically and found a
very simple function , namely

where

m =

2 m

c1 + c2 a + c3 a2 ,

a = 16

m
e2 .

(13)

(14)

from the numerical results for the massive pole at small a we get c1 =
1.953331381 . on the other hand , from the large a region we have c3 =
1. finally the constant c2 was adjusted by choosing the best tting for a
curve with about eleven thousand numerically calculated points, and it was
found to be c2 = 2.253. the maximum error of the tted function is less
than 3.8%, with the statistical controlling parameter 2 = 5.5  106. in
the gure 1 we present the curve of the massive pole as a function of the
dimensionless parameter a. note that it is impossible to distinguish the
exact from the adjusted curve in gure 1. for this reason we present in the

6

gure 2 the dependence of the percentual deviation of the tted curve from
the numerically obtained masses.

in reference [12] the derivative expansion up to second-order in k

m is used
to compute the eective potential which was also found to be of the screening
type. we have taken into account the whole expression for the polarization
tensor and found only one massive pole in the whole range of the parameter
a. since the pole can never be found at the origin we conclude that, non-
perturbatively in k/m the screening eect prevails in agreement with the
numerical analysis carried out in reference [25] for the static potential. the
truncation based on the derivative expansion only amounts to a displacement
of the massive pole from its nonperturbative ( in k/m ) value.
