abstract

we discuss ads2+1 (btz) black holes arising in type 0 string theory corre-
sponding to d1-d5 and f1-ns5 bound states. in particular we describe a new
non-dilatonic solution in the rr sector with only dp+, that is electric branes.
this system is distinguished by the absence of fermions in the world volume
theory which is an interacting cft. it can not be obtained as a projection of
a type ii bps-solution. as for previous type 0 backgrounds linear stability is
guaranteed only if the curvature is of the order of the string scale where  cor-
rections cannot be excluded. some problems concerning the counting of states
are discussed.

1 introduction

string theory has lead to important new insights in the microscopic properties of those
black holes for which the near horizon geometry consists of an anti-de sitter (ads)
throat times a sphere which represents the horizon [1].
in the case of ads2+1 the
entropy and hawking radiation can be exactly reproduced within the world volume
theory of the corresponding brane conguration of type ii string theory which in this
case is a 1+1-dimensional conformal eld theory (cft). in fact, many of the properties
of this cft, in particular, the central charge can be obtained solely by analysing the
generators of the asymptotic symmetries of the near horizon geometry [2] (see [3] for
implications for the black hole entropy). these properties are therefore universal and
essentially independent of the underlying microscopic theory. in fact ads2+1 gravity
itself without any extra elds provides the simplest representation of the conformal
algebra on the boundary [2, 4], but there are indications that gravitational degrees of
freedom alone cannot account for for all micro states needed to produce the geometric
entropy of black holes [5]. another representation of the algebra is, of course, provided
by the superconformal world volume theory of the d1d5-brane system of type ii theory
[1, 6]. so far this is essentially the only realisation for which it has been possible to
count the micro states explicitly. in that sense string theory passes a non-trivial test
for a consistent microscopic theory of gravity. one of the puzzles raised by this is
the role of supersymmetry, or the necessity of fermions in any consistent theory of
gravity. it is therefore of interest to analyse black holes in theories without space-time
supersymmetry from this point of view. as mentioned above pure gravity provides one
such theory but does not seem to be able to account for all degrees of freedom.

in this paper we consider type 0 string theory which is distinguished by being su-
persymmetric on the worldsheet but has no space-time fermions in the perturbative
closed-string sector. as we shall see under suitable assumptions about higher order cor-
rections which are, however, not excluded due to the absence of supersymmetry, there
are black hole solutions corresponding to vacua in this theory that are indistinguishable
from their type ii cousins. the world volume theory, however, is rather dierent due to
the absence of fermions. the main focus of this paper is to nd consistent solutions to
the type 0 low energy gravitational eective action and to identify the corresponding
world volume theory. previous work on the adsp+1/cf t correspondence in type 0
theories includes [7, 8]. in particular we use the results of [7] where the low energy
eective action has been determined up to second order in the tachyon.
in [8] the
d1d5 black hole solution was given and the entropy was reproduced within the
corresponding world volume theory which is, in fact, a z2 projection of the type iib
theory. this solution further analysed in [9]. in this paper we shall describe a new
solution which consists of only dp+ (i.e. electric) branes. the fact that such a cong-
uration leads to a non-dilatonic (i.e. conformal) background may come as a surprise.
indeed generically both electric- and magnetic rr-elds need to be turned on in order
to cancel the tachyon tadpole. however, as we shall see, for the d1d5-brane system
this is not so. another important feature that distinguishes the d1+d5+ black hole
constructed here is that it cannot be obtained by a projection of a corresponding type
ii solution. in particular the world volume theory is purely bosonic. this is interest-
ing, in particular in view of the the above remarks about the role of supersymmetry
in black hole physics. on the other hand, as expected, the absence of a close relation

1

with supersymmetric black holes considerably complicates the analysis of the world
volume theory in particular. so, for example is is unclear at present how the entropy
can be reproduced within world volume theory. another important issue concerns the
stability of the the background. as for all type 0 solutions constructed so far linear
stability is guaranteed only as for ads-radii of the order of the string scale. hence
 corrections to the background cannot be excluded on general grounds. however, it
has been suggested in (e.g.[7, 8]) that ads backgrounds are indeed protected due to
the vanishing of the weyl tensor, but further work is clearly needed to decide on the
stability. we address some of the issues about the world volume theory which in the
infra red is an interacting 1 + 1 dimensional cft. a more in depth analysis, needed for
an explicitly understanding of the counting of micro states will be referred to future
work.

2 type 0 strings

type 0 string theory [10] has been discussed in numerous papers. for the analysis
presented here [11] and [7] will be most relevant. these papers provide excellent sources
for the material used here so that we can limit ourself to summarise the main points.

spectrum :
here we will be concerned with type 0b string theory which is based on a non-
supersymmetric diagonal gso projection 1

2[1 + (1)f + f ], [10]

(ns, ns)  (ns+, ns+)  (r+, r+)  (r, r)

(1)

which projects out the fermions in the bulk. alternatively it can be described by
projecting type iib by the discrete symmetry generated by (1)fs, where fs is the
space time fermion number. the massless bosonic degrees of freedom in the ns-sector
contain a sector identical with the type ii theories but include the tachyon in addition.
furthermore the rr elds are doubled. correspondingly there are two sorts of dp
branes for p odd. we denote them by dp. the corresponding boundary states are
[11]

dp :

for  = p + 1,   , 9 and   {nsns, rr}.
further information about the spectrum of type ob strings comes form the obser-
vation [11] that only the combination dp+dp  dp which is charged only under the
untwisted rr-elds has the correct number of degrees of freedom to be interpreted as

2

the s-duals of the fundamental string and the ns-ve brane respectively (the d3 is
self dual [7]). the twisted elds should then be invariant under s-duality.

eective action:
the string frame low energy eective action up to second order in the tachyon has been
worked out in [7] (see also [12])

where f(t ) = 1t + 1

forms. all the other elds are set to zero. it was argued in [7] that provided the eective
action is s-duality invariant the exact form should be given by f = et .

3 non-dilatonic solutions

all non-dilatonic solutions to the type 0 low energy eective action found so far had
non-vanishing electric and magnetic rr-ux and correspond to appropriate projections
of certain type ii bps solutions. however, as we shall argue below bound states that
are purely electric or magnetic also exist but they cannot be obtained by as projections
from the type ii bps states.

we consider the six dimensional action obtained from (5) by parametrising g10 in

terms of the six dimensional einstein metric

where we have used the fact that f(0) =f 
(0) = 1. note that this is satised for any
rrt coupling f(t ) that agrees with 1  t up to o(t ). a particular solution of the
the system (12) is given by ri+ = ri, i = 1, 5. this is the solution discussed in a paper
by costa [8]. however, (12) admits yet another set of solutions for ri = 0 (ri+ = 0).
this new class of black hole solutions has electric (dp+) brane charge but no magnetic
charge. more precisely one nds

(13)

note that we have chosen the solution which is ads2+1 for all r (up to identications). it
corresponds to the near horizon regime of the asymptotically at solution. the present
solution is more suitable for reasons of stability but encodes the essential features of
asymptotically at black holes [14].

the obvious question that arises now is whether the set of all these solutions is
connected. this turns out to be the case. indeed (12) admits a family of solutions
with

r1+ = r5+  r+ and r1 = r5  r,

naive substitution of (10) into the action leads to the wrong sign for the electric potential.

but r+ 6= r. this family interpolates between the set of dp black holes discussed by
costa [8] and the the set of electric (dp+) solutions described above. the metric for
the interpolating solutions (14) can be obtained from (13) upon substitution

1 = r2
r2

5 = qr4

.

(15)

to summarise:
the low energy eective action for type 0b theory admits a continuous family of solu-
tions interpolating between the d1d5 and the d1+d5+ congurations. this defor-
mation preserves the non-dilatonic background.

in the ns sector we parameterise h by

h = 2r2

53 + 2r2

the corresponding solution is as in the type ii case

(17)

hence the metric is identical with the rr-solution. one might take this as an indication
that that the conguration (17) is the s-dual of the d1+d5+ conguration. this is
however misleading. as explained in section 2 and [11] the degrees of freedom of the
d1+ string do not match those of the fundamental string.

to obtain the (extremal) black hole one proceeds as usual [15] by adding momentum

in the z direction, that is

stability:
an important point in all type 0 congurations is the stability. for the congura-
tion with unequal electric- and magnetic charge the new issue arising is the mixing
tachyonic- and -modes2 (recall  describes the internal volume). more precisely the
mass matrix becomes

in either case the curvature is of order of  and hence corrections to the metric are to
be expected unless the backgrounds is protected. it was observed before (e.g.
[7, 8])
that this applies to ads2+1s3 backgrounds provided these corrections can be written
in terms of the weyl tensor only.
for the f1ns5 conguration there is no mixing between the tachyon and  and

consequently linear stability requires

(26)

where g is the string coupling.

4 world volume theory

the metric of the d1+d5+ black hole described in the last section is identical with
type iib. the entropy and the hawking decay rate are therefore also identical. if the

black hole background described in the last section is a consistent ground state of string
theory then it should be possible to reproduce these features form the world volume
theory of the d1+d5+ system. this task is, however, complicated by the absence of
supersymmetry or equivalently, by the presence of the tachyon which prevents us from
interpolating the background to curvature much smaller than 1/. as a result the
predictions for the world volume theory can be trusted only up to - corrections.

as a rst step towards a detailed understanding of the world volume theory we
discuss the existence an the nature of the d1+d5+ bound state4. for this we compute
the open string loop amplitude in terms of the corresponding boundary states. the
relevant amplitudes can be extracted from e.g. [11]. for the ns-ns sector we have

where

m  = 
and the same relation for the fermionic modes 
m. the rr sector works analogously.
the relevant amplitudes are then given by

as they stand the t-integrals are, however, not well dened due to the divergence at
t  0. as explained in [16] this divergence is related to the presence of a tachyonic mode
in the closed string sector and the coecients of counter terms needed to cancel the
small t divergences will depend on the details of the tachyon condensation. fortunately
for v1,1 and v1,5 it turns out that the counter term is eld independent and can therefore
be discarded. for r2 <<  and  = the resulting potentials read

v1,1(r) = 
1
v1,5(r) =
4

r2
2 log(r2) and
v1,1(r).

(32)

4we refer the reader to [8] for the analogous analysis of the dp bound states.

7

in contrast to the d3+ system [7], the potential for d1+d1+ and for d1+d5+ is
attractive for small distances. this is consistent with the existence of a conformal
(non-dilatonic) gravitational background. for a d5+d5+-pair the potential takes the
form

r6

3!646()3 log(r2).

v5,5(r) = c0 + c1r2 + c2r4 +

(33)

as mentioned above the constants ci depend on the details of the tachyon condensation
which is not understood in detail so far. we are therefore unable to x them at present.
the conguration with r = 0 (i.e. all d5+ on top of each other) is an extremum of v5,5(r)
for all values of the ci. however, the sign of c1 determine whether this conguration is
stable. if the stable conguration is at r > 0 then, unless q5 << q1 most of the (1, 1)
and the (1, 5) strings will be massive and will not contribute signicantly to the entropy.
if, on the other hand all of the d5+ branes are on top of each other then the (1, 1) and
the (1, 5) strings will be massless. however, a naive counting of the massless degrees
of freedom still only accounts for 2/3 of the beckenstein-hawking entropy. indeed the
4q1q5 bosonic degrees of freedom lead to a central charge [15]

c = 4q1q5

(34)

which is to be compared with c = 6q1q5 in the type iib case. the dierence is, of
course due to the absence of fermions in the world volume theory. however, because
the worldvolume theory is interacting even in the infrared the arguments presented
above are probably too naive and a more quantitative analysis of the world volume
theory will be needed.

5 discussion

in this paper we have described a new class of non-dilatonic type 0 backgrounds distin-
guished by the fact that only one of the two rr-uxes (f[n]) is active. unlike previous
non-dilatonic backgrounds the solutions described here cannot be obtained by a pro-
jection of some type ii bps state. in particular we constructed an ads2+1 (btz) black
hole from electric d1+d5+ branes. a novel feature of this conguration is the absence
of fermions in the world volume theory. the existence of a non-dilatonic gravity dual
suggests, however, that in the ir the world volume theory should nevertheless ow to a
conformal eld theory. in this paper we presented but a qualitative analysis the world
volume theory. from a more detailed analysis of the interactions we may hope to gain
valuable insight into the role of fermions in the microscopic theory of black holes. for
that purpose the observation that the system can be continuously deformed form the
d1d5 to the d1+d5+ conguration may prove useful. as all type 0 congurations
a tachyonic instability develops when the curvature decreases below the string scale. it
seems reasonable to believe that this instability should have an analogue in the world
volume theory, for example, in form of a large n phase transition. a similar proposal
has been made recently in [17] for the world volume theory of the non-supersymmetric
d3-brane system of type 0 theory. it would be interesting to analyse the d1d5-brane
system from this point of view.
