(82) formula needed main text. considerations relating black hole entropy need couple rene- ments. first, customary include scalar charge, i.e. momentum p7 along r7 direction. resulting term eigenvalue equation commutes background terms anticommuetes terms u(1) charges. additionally, p7 small scaling limit, order l0 p, cross-terms scalar charge u(1) charges negligible. facts sucient ensure p7 included (82) simple addition. next, want derive conformal weight left-movers. roughly, amounts substitution 7, ipping eigenvalue momentum; 35 alternatively one might ip ve-brane numbers taking opposite quantum numbers 1234, 3456, 1256. either way problem, eigenvalues -matrices independent. physical origin problem present theory chiral, (4, 0) supersymmetry. conformal weight left-movers therefore given supersymmetry alone. contrasts treatment d1 d5 system {$9905064$}, (4, 4) supersymmetry exploited deduce right-moving left-moving weights. main text nd left-moving weights using global symmetries.
