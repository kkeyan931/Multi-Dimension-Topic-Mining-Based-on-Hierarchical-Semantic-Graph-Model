the construction of gauge invariant regularization for the chiral theories (even for the

anomaly free ones) was an open problem for a long time. only recently such a regularization

was proposed for the standard model [1]; some generalisations and important insights on

the issue can be found in refs.[2][4]. the new regularization (called generalised pauli

villars regularization) is a version of the standard gauge-invariant paulivillars one where

one regularizes entire loops, but not separate propagators. the main dierence is that

innitely many regulator elds are used. therefore, in order to specify the regularization

completely, one needs for any divergent diagram a recipe for how to handle the innite sum

of the terms due to regulator elds. in this letter our aim is to show that the contribution

of the regulator elds can be calculated on the lagrangian level, so as to give a nonlocal

theory.

we begin with a short description of the generalised paulivillars regularization of

the standard model.

in ref.[1] a construction [5] is used, where all one-generation

matter elds are combined into a single chiral so(10) spinor + (which is also a chiral

lorentzian spinor) and all gauge elds  into an so(10) gauge eld. the gauge eld

lagrangian is regularized by the higher covariant derivative method and is not considered

in [1] (and neither is here). in addition to the original elds an innite set of commuting

and anticommuting paulivillars elds (r and r respectively, r  1) is added. these

new elds are simultaneously chiral lorentzian spinors and non-chiral so(10) ones. the

explicit form of the mass terms for the regulator elds is determined by the requirement

that they are nonzero, real, so(10) and lorentzian scalars and by the chirality properties

of the elds. as a result the lorentz and so(10) charge conjugation matrices (cd and c)

have to be used. (basic feature of any charge conjugation matrix c is that c transforms

under the conjugate representation to that of .) a list of properties of cd and c used

in this work is given in appendix.

(1)

here 6d is the covariant derivative with respect to the so(10) gauge eld a, 6d =  ( 

igaij

 ij), ij are the so(10) generators; mr = m r, where m is a (large) mass parameter

(paulivillars mass) and a summation over r  1 is assumed. this form of mr is crucial

for the convergence of the diagrams in the model [2] while the concrete sign of mr does

not matter. introducing the projectors on the irreducible spinor representations:

 =

(1   5) and p =

2

(1  11)

the chirality properties of the elds read:

+ = r = r = 0,

p+ = pr = pr = 0,

where r = r+ + r and analogously for r.

any so(10) gauge model is anomaly free, and so it is not a big surprise that (1) could

be rewritten in a vector-like form. following [3] we introduce variables

r = r+ + ccd t

r,

r = r+ + ccd t

r.

(2)

both these new elds are so(10) chiral and lorentzian non-chiral spinors contrary to the

original ones.

pr = pr = 0,

+r = r+; r = ccd t

r,

+r = r+; r = ccd

using denitions (2) and the ones following from them r = r+  t

rccd and r =

r+  t

rccd, eq.(1) takes the form

lreg = +i 6d+ + r(i 6d  mr) + r(i 6d + mr).

(3)

the berezian corresponding to the change of variables (2) is 1, which guarantees that

lagrangians (1) and (3) describes one and the same theory.

now we want to reformulate (3) as a higher derivative theory. following [6] our rst

step is to replace the commuting paulivillars elds by anticommuting ones. the idea is

to consider instead of

the following one

l = (i 6d  m )

l = (  + )(i 6d  m )( + ),

(4)

(5)

where  is an additional dynamical eld. this lagrangian has a very large stuckelberg-

type gauge symmetry. its xing produces faddeevpopov ghosts ( and ) which have

statistics, opposite to , i.e. they are normal anticommuting spinors. a particular gauge

choice brings (5) into (4) plus ghosts terms trivially decoupled from the dynamics; another

gauge choice leaves only

l = (i 6d  m )

(6)

(plus decoupled -terms). thus eqs.(4) and (6) describe the same physics. this is true

provided there are no sources for the eld  (and ) in the model and this is exactly the

situation with the paulivillars elds. applying the procedure described above to all r

the lagrangian (3) could be rewritten as:

lreg = +i 6d+ + r(i 6d + mr)  r(i 6d  mr),

(7)

where all elds are anticommuting now.

our next step is to combine dierent terms in (7) into a single higher derivative

lagrangian. it was shown in [6] that the lagrangian

l = g (i 6d  m1)(i 6d  m2)

after suitable legendre transformation could be put into the form

l =

g

|g| (cid:0) 1(i 6d  m1)1  2(i 6d  m2)2(cid:1)

3

and vice-versa, provided m1 > m2. note that up to a sign the last lagrangian is indepen-

dent of the coupling constant g. such decomposition into a sum of rst order lagrangians

holds for any higher derivative lagrangian l = qi(i 6d  mi), if mi 6= mj i, j : i 6= j.

here we use these results to bring together dierent terms in (7). we combine paulivillars

terms with equal r and obtain

lreg = +i 6d+  r(1 

6d2
m 2r2 ),

where we have used the freedom to the choose coupling constant to be gr = (m r)2. in this

way we have introduced a small parameter (1/m ) which counts the order of the derivatives

in the lagrangian.

such a parameter is needed in any higher derivative theory [7]. it

automatically produces the so called perturbative constraints which exclude the unwanted

negative norm states (those of paulivillars elds in our case). then we add one after

the other the new second derivative terms to the matter eld term and get

l = i 6d



yr=1

(cid:18)1 

6d2

m 2r2(cid:19) .

(8)

the solution of the equation of motion following from the lagrangian (8) is  = p

where (i 6d  m r)r = 0. it describes the full set of the matter and paulivillars elds.

 r

the only remnant from the perturbative constraints is

|physical >= 0

(9)

which excludes the paulivillars elds from the physical ones. finally, using the formula

we obtain

sin (x) = x



yr=1

(cid:18)1 

x2

2r2(cid:19)

lreg = m  sin(cid:18) i 6d

m (cid:19).

(10)

eq.(10) together with the constraint (9) give us the nonlocal version of the regularized

lagrangian of the standard model.

a nal note: lagrangian (10) could be rewritten as lreg = i 6df (d2/m 2), where

f (x2) = sin x/x. in this form it is closely related to the interpretation of the generalised

paulivillars regularization discussed in [4].
