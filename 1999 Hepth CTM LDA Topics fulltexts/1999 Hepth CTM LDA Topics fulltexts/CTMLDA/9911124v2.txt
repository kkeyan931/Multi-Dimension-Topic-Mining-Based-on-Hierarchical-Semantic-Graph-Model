abstract

string or m-theory in the background of kerr-ads black holes is thought to be dual to
the large n limit of certain conformal eld theories on a rotating sphere at nite temper-
ature. the ve dimensional black hole is associated to n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills
theory on a rotating three-sphere and the four dimensional one to the superconformal eld
theory of coinciding m2 branes on a rotating two-sphere. the thermodynamic potentials
can be expanded in inverse powers of the radius of the sphere. we compute the leading
and subleading terms of this expansion in the eld theory at one loop and compare them
to the corresponding supergravity expressions. the ratios between these terms at weak
and strong coupling turns out not to depend on the rotation parameters in the case of
n = 4 sym. for the eld theory living on one m2 brane we nd a subleading logarithmic
term. no such term arises from the supergravity calculation.

1. introduction

the ads/cft correspondence relates string or m-theory on mn  x dn, where mn
is an space of negative curvature and x dn an einstein manifold, to eld theories living
on the (conformal) boundary of these spaces [1,2,3] (see [4] for a comprehensive review).
it is particularly interesting to consider mn being asymptotically ads black holes. the
dual eld theories are then at nite temperature, with the eld theory temperature given
by the hawking temperature of the black hole.

an example is the ads black hole with planar horizon. it arises as the near horizon
limit of the near extremal d3-brane [5]. the dual eld theory is n = 4 supersymmetric
it turns out that the entropy, as calculated from the supergravity
yang-mills theory.
approximation to string theory, diers by a factor of 3
4 from the one calculated in the gauge
theory [6]. this dierence comes from the fact that the supergravity side corresponds to
the gauge theory at innite t hooft coupling,  = g2
y m n , whereas the gauge theory
calculation applies for weak t hooft coupling1,2. the coupling constant dependence of
the entropy has been investigated in the strong [9] and weak [10] coupling limits. because
of the underlying conformal symmetry the temperature is the only scale in these problems.
for this reason it is guaranteed that the entropy of the ads black hole scales with the
temperature in the same way as the conformal eld theory. it seems therefore interesting
to investigate situations where there are dimensionless parameters.

this can be achieved by considering the conformal eld theory living on a sphere.
the entropy can then be multiplied by an a priori arbitrary function of the product of the
temperature and the radius of the sphere. the supergravity duals are ads black holes
with spherical horizons. the precise dependence on the dimensionless parameter  = 1
t r
is easy to calculate in gravity. on the conformal eld theory side it is however far from
trivial to extract this dependence in a closed form. expressions for the one loop energy of
conformal elds on the three-sphere at nite temperature have been obtained long ago in
[11] in form of innite sums. one can however reside to a high temperature or large radius
expansion

f = v n 2t 4 
xn=0

bn()n .

(1.1)

the leading term in such an expansion coincides with the at space result. a strong
weak/coupling comparison of the subleading terms has been performed in [12]. the cou-
pling constant dependence on the supergravity limit has been investigated in [13].

1 in [7] it was argued on general grounds that there should be a factor of order one between

the strong and weak coupling result in n = 4 yang-mills.

2 it is interesting to note that a factor of 4

5 between the thermal pressure at strong and weak

coupling appears in the large n limit of an o(n ) scalar eld theory in three dimensions [8].

a way to include more dimensionless parameters is to consider kerr-ads black holes
[14,15,16,17]. the angular velocities give rise to new dimensionless parameters. the ther-
modynamic potential of these black holes presents a characteristic divergence when the
angular velocity reaches the speed of light. the ads correspondence relates these black
holes to conformal eld theories on a rotating einstein universe. the thermodynamic po-
tential of the conformal eld theory shows the same divergence as its supergravity dual.
in [18] it was shown that the ratio of the potentials in the extreme high temperature limit
is independent of the angular velocities and still 3
4 . a numerical calculation of the ratio
between the free energies of the ads black hole and the conformal eld theories with vary-
ing rotation parameter has been performed in [16]. they found that the ratio depends on
the rotation parameters although it always tends to 3

4 in the high temperature limit.

the aim of this paper is to calculate the subleading terms in the high temperature
expansion of the thermodynamic potential in eld theory with rotation parameters present.
for the case of n = 4 sym on s3 we have two independent angular velocities corresponding
to the cartan subalgebra of the su (2)  su (2) isometries of s3. we take the generic
case with both angular velocities dierent from zero and also dierent from each other.
we nd that the functional dependence of the subleading term is the same at weak and
at strong coupling. their ratio is given by b2()
2 , which coincides with the result
in the non-rotating case [12]. this is remarkable since there does not seem to exist an
obvious symmetry that constrains the functional form of this coecient. our result is also
consistent with [16] since the ratio of the thermodynamic potentials at strong and weak
coupling does depend on the angular velocities.

b2(0) = 3

four dimensional kerr-ads black holes are dual to the superconformal eld theory
arising on the world volume of m2 branes on a rotating two-sphere. we do not have
an explicit formulation of this theory when more that one m2-brane coincide. we know
however the theory for a single m2-brane, it is the n = 8 supersingleton theory. m-theory
on ads4  s7 has only one expansion parameter, the number of coincident m2-branes.
it seems therefore the most natural analogue to the strong/weak coupling comparisons in
four dimensions to compare the theories in three dimensions at n =  and at n = 1.
we nd that the subleading term at n = 1 behaves logarithmically with the temperature.
this is in strong contrast to the behaviour at n =  where we nd only polynomial
behaviour in the high temperature expansion.

in order to derive subleading contributions to the thermodynamic potential of the
eld theory living on spheres, we have to evaluate sums over modes. we present a simple
method to approximate sums to arbitrary accuracy when an small parameter is present.

g5 is the newtons constant in ve dimensions. the thermodynamic potential is dened

the eld theory interpretation is that there is a deconning phase for r+ > 1 [20]. this
is also the regime where we want to compare with the eld theory at weak coupling. in
order to do so we would like to express the thermodynamic potential in terms of t and
i. in the large t and large r+ regime we can invert (2.4) and (2.5) approximately

here v = 4 is the volume of the unit two-sphere.

3. field theory calculation

we want to calculate the thermodynamics of four-dimensional n = 4 yang-mills on a
rotating three-sphere in the weak coupling limit. at weak (zero) coupling we will calculate
the 1-loop approximation to the partition function, in which colored degrees of freedom run
in the loop. this is only consistent in the deconned phase of the theory. the interacting
n = 4 theory on the sphere is in a deconned phase only at high temperature. this holds
even at weak coupling [20,22]. therefore we will concentrate in the high temperature
regime.

5

the thermal part of the 1-loop contribution to the partition function of a eld theory

on s3 where matter is forced to rotate with angular velocities 1 and 2, is

log z = xi

i



xl,m1,m2

log(cid:16)1  i e(i

l +m11+m22)(cid:17) ,

(3.1)

with i labelling the particle species, i = 1 for bosons and 1 for fermions, and i
l is the
energy of a mode of angular momentum l. we will assume that the scalars of n = 4
are conformally coupled since supergravity determines the eld theory metric only up to
conformal transformations. then the thermodynamics will depend only on the dimension-
less quantities t r and ir, where r is the radius of the sphere. the high temperature
limit is equivalent to the large radius limit of the sphere keeping constant the speed of
the boundary, ir. thus the leading term in the high temperature expansion of (3.1)
can be obtained by substituting the discrete sums in (3.1) by integrals [14,18]. we will be
interested in obtaining subleading terms; for that we will have to deal directly with the
sums in (3.1).

3.1. approximate evaluation of sums

as a rst step we would like to evaluate sums of the generic form

fl ,

l2

xl=l1

(3.2)

where fl depends of an small parameter  and we can dene a function f (x) such that
fl = f (l). in the limit of very small , we have formally l  dx (l = 1 in (3.2)).
our only hypothesis will be that f (x) =r f (x) dx is analytic in the interval [x1, x2], with

x1 = l1 and x2 = (l2 + 1). we have then

l2

z x2

x1

f (x) dx =

xl=l1(cid:2)f ((l + 1))  f (l)(cid:3)

we can expand the rhs in a taylor series, obtaining

xl=l1

f (k)(l) ,

(3.4)

where f (k) = dkf /dxk. applying recursively this reasoning to f (k) we can evaluate (3.2)
to any order in the small parameter . up to order 4 it is straightforward to obtain

(3.7)

this expression is not the nal answer since we will consider situations in which both the
functions that appear in (3.5) and x1, x2 can have an explicit dependence on . in that
case we will have to further taylor expand (3.5) to the desired order in .

as a test of this approach, we will rst calculate the high temperature expansion of the
energy of n = 4 yang-mills on s3 without rotation at weak coupling. this was obtained
long ago in [11] and recently reobtained using the heat kernel method in [12]. the 1-loop
contribution to the thermal part of the energy of n = 4 yang-mills on s3 is

where s denotes the spin of scalars, fermions and gauge bosons, ds

with spin s and energy s
l and ns are the number of elds of each spin present in the vector
multiplet of n = 4, i.e. n0 = 6, n1/2 = 4 and n1 = 1. the data for scalars and fermions
are

in both cases l = (l + 1)/r and l runs on the integers for bosons and half-integer for
fermions.

we have to take care of a subtlety in the spectrum of gauge elds on the three-sphere at
nite temperature. the spectrum of a gauge theory on s3 in the feynman gauge a = 0
has been found some time ago in [23]. the vector eld can be classied according to the
representation of the so(4) = su (2)  su (2) isometry of the three-sphere. we label its
representations by (j1, j2). the temporal component is a scalar on the three-sphere and
its modes fall into the ( l
2 ), l  0 representation. the vector modes on the sphere form
2 ), l  1 representations. we denote the ( l
2 , l
2 + 1, l
the ( l
2 + 1) and
2 ) modes of the three-vector by ~a0. the energies are
2 , l
2 + 1, l

scalars and therefore fall into the ( l

(3.9)

the ghost elds have to be taken periodic around the s1 and thus are subject to the
bose-einstein distribution despite their fermionic nature. they contribute with negative
sign to (3.6). we see now that the ghosts compensate the a0 and the ~a0 contributions up
to a left over zero energy mode. if we were on r  s3 we could gauge away the zero mode
of the temporal component of the gauge eld and there would be no reason to include
the zero modes of the ghosts. on s1  s3 however the gauge eld zero mode can not be
removed by a proper (periodic on s1) gauge transformation. therefore these zero modes
have to be included in the spectrum. the contribution from the left over zero mode to
(3.6) is

we have to add this to the contributions from the transversal gauge eld modes.

after these remarks we can apply (3.5) to (3.6). the small parameter is  = 1/t r.
the function fi(x) associated to each species can be obtained simply by substituting
l  x/ in (3.6). the upper limit of the continuous variable is x2 = . all functions
appearing in the rhs of (3.5) tend to zero at innity 3, therefore the sum is determined
by the value of the functions at x1. we have x1 = 0, /2,  for scalars, fermions and (the
transversal modes of the) gauge bosons respectively, obtaining

where all functions are well dened in the limit   0. we have now to taylor expand
each function around  = 0. the denition (3.1) involves logarithms which make taylor
expansions around  = 0 ill-dened. this is the reason why we chose to calculate the
energy instead of log z. we can then use the relation e =  
 log z to derive the partition
function up to a temperature independent term. from (3.11) we obtain the contribution
of each species to the energy of the gauge theory [11,12]

3.2. n = 4 yang-mills on a rotating 3-sphere

after having tested our method on a simple example, we want to apply it to n =
4 yang-mills on a rotating three-sphere. the partition function can be used to obtain
the thermodynamic potential f = t log z in the grand-canonical ensemble, where the
thermodynamic variables are the temperature and the angular velocities. as before, we
will calculate 
 log z instead of log z. we set in the following r = 1 for convenience.
therefore the small parameter will be just the inverse of the temperature, . we will
analyse separately the contribution of scalars4, fermions and gauge bosons, which in terms
of the spin of each species is given by [16]

here  are the angular velocities corresponding to the cartan elements of the su (2)

by  = 1  2 [16].

we will only be interested in the leading and rst subleading term of the high tem-
perature expansion. for that it is enough to evaluate the sums to order 2. we have to
apply three times (3.5). the calculation simplies by the fact that we can dene a single
variable x such that when x = (l + 1) + m+ + n the function

f (x) =

(3.15)

equals flmn, where flmn denote the summand in (3.14). the function f (x) and its

we have used  = 1  2. for the particular case of n = 4 yang-mills we have

in [18] the leading contribution to the thermodynamics of n = 4 yang-mills on a rotating
s3 was analysed in the high temperature limit. the discrepancy by a factor 3/4 between
the strong and weak coupling limits of the thermodynamics potentials which holds for the
gauge theory in at non-rotating space, was found in [18] to hold exactly also for the case
with one rotation parameter, i.e. 2 = 0. this is a somehow surprising result since the
rotation introduce new dimensionless parameters such that strong and weak coupling limits
could dier by an arbitrary function of the s. comparing (2.8) and (3.24) we observe
that the simple factor 3/4 between the t 4 term at strong and weak coupling persists in
the generic case with two rotations. moreover, a stronger result holds. the strong and
weak coupling contribution to the thermodynamic potentials at the subleading order t 2
dier again only by a numerical factor, 3/2. there is no obvious symmetry reason that
could explain this behaviour.

the relation between strong and weak coupling limits of the thermodynamic potential
for the system with two rotations as a function of the horizon radius r+ was investigated
numerically in [16]. the ratio fst/fw decreases from 3/4 at t   to zero at the hawking-
page phase transition point r+ = 1. however it decreases slower for systems with stronger
rotation. we can reproduce that result for high temperature from (3.24)

3.3. the n = 8 supersingleton on a rotating sphere

as already mentioned in the introduction, the four dimensional kerr-ads black hole is
thought to be dual to the superconformal eld theory arising on coinciding m2-branes. we
only have a lagrangian formulation for the case of the eld theory on a single m2-brane.
this is the n = 8 supersingleton theory consisting of eight conformally coupled scalars and
eight spinors. it seems most natural to compare the large n limit of this theory represented
by supergravity to the n = 1 eld theory, since there is no dimensionless coupling as in
the four dimensional case. for the same reason as before we will actually compute 
 log z

it has been noted in [24] that the leading term contains a -function with odd integer
argument. for this reason there can not be an agreement up to some rational number
between the supergravity result and the eld theory result. for the leading term there is
still a minimal agreement between the two results since their scaling with the temperature
is the same. this is however to be expected because the leading term corresponds to the
at space limit and in this case conformal symmetry dictates the scaling with t . the
scaling of the subleading term can however not be predicted by conformal symmetry. as
we see now it is indeed dierent. the eld theory calculation shows logarithmic behaviour,
whereas the supergravity result gives polynomial behaviour5. in fact even the functional
dependence on  is dierent for the subleading terms. in the light of these results it seems
even more remarkable that the four dimensional calculations show such a high agreement.

we would like to thank e. alvarez and m. tytgat for discussions.

5 we remind the reader that we have set the radius of the sphere r = 1. in this conventions

t coincides with the dimensionless parameter  introduced earlier.
