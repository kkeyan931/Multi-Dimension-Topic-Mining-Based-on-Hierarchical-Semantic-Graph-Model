a string in four dimensions is constructed by supplement-
ing it with forty four majorana fermions. the central charge
is 26. the fermions are grouped in such a way that the re-
sulting action is supersymmetric. the super-virasoro algebra
is constructed and closed by the use of jacobi identity. the
tachyonic ground state decouples from the physical states.
gso projections are necessary for proving modular invariance
and space-time supersymmetry is shown to exist for modes of
zero mass. the symmetry group of the model desends to the
low energy group su (3)  su (2)  u (1)  u (1).

i. introduction

string theory was invented [1] as a sequel to dual res-
onance models [2] to explain the properties of strongly
interacting particles in four dimensions. assuming the
string to live in a background gravitational eld and de-
manding weyl invariance, the einstein equations of gen-
eral relativity could be deduced.
it was believed that
about these classical solutions one can expand and nd
the quantum corrections. but diculties arose at the
quantum level. eventhough the strong interaction am-
plitude obeyed crossing, it was no longer unitary. there
were anomalies and ghosts. due to these compelling rea-
sons it was necessary for the open string to live in 26
dimensions [3,16]. at present the most successful the-
ory is the ten dimensional superstring on a calabi-yau
manifold or an orbifold. however, in order to realise the
programme of string unication of all the four particle
interaction, one must eventually arrive at a theory in
four at space-time dimensions, with n=1 supersymme-
try and chiral matter elds. this paper is an attempt in
that direction.

a lot of research has been done in the construction
of four dimensional strings [4] specially in the latter half
of the eighties. antoniadis et al [5] have considered a
four dimensional superstring supplemented by eighteen
real fermions in trilinear coupling. the central charge of
the construction is 15. chang and kumar [6] have consid-
ered thirring fermions, but again with the central charge
at 15. kawai et al [7] have considered four dimensional
model in a dierent context than the model proposed
here. none of these makes contact with a standard like
model.

in section ii, we give the details of the supersym-
metric model. section iii gives the usual quantization

and super-virasoro algebra is deduced in the section iv.
bosonic states are constructed in section v. fadeev-
popov ghosts are introduced and the brst charge is
explicitly constucted in section vi. ramond states are
constructed in section vii. in section viii the mass
spectrum of the model and the necessary gso projec-
tions to eliminate the half integral spin states are intro-
duced.
in section ix, we show that these projections
are necessary to prove the modular invariance of the
model. space-time supersymmetry is shown to exist for
the zero mass modes in sction x. in section xi we show
how the chain so(44)  so(11)  so(6)  so(5) 
su (3)  su (2)  u (1)  u (1) is possible in this model.
the literature on string theory is very vast and exist
in most text books on the subject. the references serve
only as a guide to elucidate the model.

ii. the model

the model essentially consists of 26 vector bosons of an
open (closed) string in which there are the four bosonic
coordinates of four dimensions and there are fortyfour
majorana fermions representing the remaining 22 bosonic
coordinates [8]. we divide them into four groups . they
are labelled by  = 0, 1, 2, 3 and each group contains
11 fermions. these 11 fermions are again divided into
two groups, one containing six and the other ve. for
convenience, in one group we have j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and
in the other, k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

the string action is

s = 

1

2 z d2(cid:2)x x  i ,j,j  i,k,k(cid:3) ,

(1)

 are the two dimensional dirac matrices

0 =(cid:18) 0 i

i 0 (cid:19) ,

1 =(cid:18) 0 i
i 0(cid:19)

and obey

{, } = 2 .

(2)

(3)

string co-ordinates x  are scalars in (,  ) space and vec-
tors in target space. similarly ,j are spinors in (,  )
space and vectors in target space.

in general we follow the notations and conventions of
reference [9] whenever omitted by us. x (,  ) are the
string coordinates. the s are the odd indexed and s

the action is invariant under innitesimal transforma-

tions

try transformations gives a spatial translation, namely

to proceed further we note that in equation (8) and
(14) we could have taken i instead of +i. we now in-
troduce a phase factor  to replace i in these equa-
tion.
 depends on the number n of s (or its
quantar), in a given individual term. explicitly  =
(1)1/4n(n1)+ 1
2 .  = i if n = 1 reproducing i in
the above equations. but 2
 = 1 if n = 0 where two
s have been contracted away and 2

 = 1 if n = 2.

one now readily calculates the algebra

{j+(), j+()}= (  )t++()
{j(), j()}= (  )t()
{j+(), j()}= 0

(20)

the time like components of x  are eliminated by the
use of virasoro constraints t++ = t = 0. in view of
equation (20), we postuate that

0 = j+ = j = t++ = t

(21)

j+ is a sum of a real and imaginary term, the real
term, is further, a sum of six mutually independent ,j
s and the imaginary term, the ve mutually independent
,k s.
it will be shown in section v, that j+ = 0
constraint excludes all the eleven time like components
of s and s from the physical space.

iii. quantization

as usual the theory is quantized (

o = p), with

x  = x + p + ixn6=0

n

n expin cos(n),


(22)

in deriving this, the dirac equation for the spinors have
been used. the noether super-current is

or

j =

(15)

x  =

we now follow the standard procedure. the light cone
components of the current and energy momentum tensors
are

(16)

(17)

while discussing the mass spectrum, it will be more
illuminating to consider the closed string. the related
additional quantas here and in wherever occurs will be
denoted by attaching a tilde. for instance

the transition formulas for closed strings can be easily
eected. we consider the open string. we rst choose
the neveu-schwarz (ns) [10] boundary condition. then
the mode expansions of the fermions are

virasoro generators [11] are given by the modes of the
energy momentum tensor t++ and noether current j+,

lation operators

where

in each case normal ordering is required. the single

rent generator is

following from eqn. (33) the virasoro algebra is

using the relations

(44)

which implies, consistent with equations (34) and (35),

{gm

r+s + b(r)r+s

(45)

a(m) and b(r) are normal ordering anomalies. taking
the vacuum expectation value in the fock ground state
|0, 0i with four momentum p = 0 of the commutator
[l1, l1] and [l2, l2], it is easily found that

a(m) =

(m3  m) =

(47a)

(47b)

the central charge c = 26. this is what is expected.
each bosonic coordinate contribute 1 and each fermionic
ones contribute 1/2, so that the total central charge is
+26.

for closed strings there will be another set of tilded

generators satisfying the same algebra.

v. bosonic states

l1l1 | i = 2h  | l0 | i = 0. let us consider the next
higher mass state

a physical bosonic state  which should have so(6)

so(5) internal symmetry satises

lm
m | i = 0

gm

| i = 0

m > 0

r > 0

(48)

(49)

the real and imaginary parts of gm

ish for r > 0. specialising to a rest frame we write the
conditions as

m | i + (terms quadratic in osillators) | i = 0
(50)

1 | 2i+(g3/2g1/2+g1/2g3/2) | 3i+g

| i = l2 | 1i+l2
it can be shown that g3/2g1/2 | i = (1l2
2l2)
calculated by evaluating (cid:2)l1, g3/2g1/2(cid:3) | i and
(cid:2)l2, g3/2g1/2(cid:3) | i. g4

the coecients 1 and 2 can be

so, in essence, we have the next excited state as

1/2 is proportional to l2

| i.

1.

| i =(cid:0)l2 + l2

1(cid:1) | i

(54)

the condition (l0  1) | i = 0 is satised if (l0 + 1) |
i = 0. further the physical state condition l1 | i = 0
gives the value of  = 3/2. the norm is easily obtained
as

p0(b0,1

r +    + b0,6

r ) | i + (terms containing both  and b oscillators) | i = 0

h | i =

or b0,1

rs or bk

the resulting states in the second terms of equations
(50), (51), (52) are dierent from the rst terms. so we
concentrate our attention for the vanishing of the rst
term only. to satisfy equation (50), as usual the time like
component 0
m is excluded from . as a result the second
terms of equation (51) and (52) contain only transverse
osillators. b0,1
are all independent
anahilation operators for r > 0 and there is no relation
between them. therefore  should not contain any of the
eleven time like components bj
r s, for, otherwise
the equality to zero in equations (51) and (52) cannot be
achieved. thus the vanishing of the energy-momentym
tensor and the current excludes all the time like compo-
nents from the physical space. no negative norm state
will show up in the physical spectrum and at the same
time preserve so(6)  so(5) internal symmetry.
let us make a more detailed investigation to ensure
that there are no negative norm physical states. we shall
do this by constructing the zero norm states or the null
physical states. due to gso condition, which we shall
study later, the physical states will be obtained by oper-
ation of the product of even number of gs. so the lowest
state above the tachyonic state is

| i = l1 | 1i + g1/2g1/2 | 2i

but g1/2g1/2 = 1
loss of generality, the state is

2{g1/2, g1/2} = l1. without

| i = l1 | i

(53)

this state to be physical, it must satisfy (l01) | i = 0
which is true if l0 | i = 0. the norm h | i = h  |

4

this is negative for c < 26 and vanishes for c = 26. so
the critical cenbtral charge is 26. it is easily checked that
l2 | i also vanishes for c = 26.
norm of the following state with p2 = 2

to nd the role of b and b modes, let us calculate the

(l2 + 3/2l2

reference [9].

(56)

2 = 1

1 | 0, pi = l(b
1) | 0, pi = 0; l(b)
3/2  b

noting that l(b)
2 =
2 b3/2  b1/2 and l(b)
1/2 the norms
of the second and third terms are 1
4 (jj ) = 6 and
1
4 (kk) = 5 respectively. the norm of the state given
in equation (56) is 11 + 6 + 5 = 0
1/2, l1 | i = 0 implies g1/2 | i = 0.
g3/2 can be expressed as a commutator of l1 and g1/2,
so that g3/2 | i = 0. further l2 | i = 1
2{g3/2, g1/2} |
i = 0 and so on satisng all the physical state condi-
tions.

since l1 = g2

vi. ghosts

for obtaining a zero central charge so that the anoma-
lies cancel out and natural ghosts are isolated, faddeev-
popov (fp) ghosts [12] are introduced. the fp ghost
action is

sf p =

1

 z (c+b++ + c+b)d2

(57)

where the ghost elds b and c satisfy the anticommutator
relations

{b++(,  ), c+(,  )} = 2 (  )

(58)

[lg

m, ggh

r ] = (m/2  r)ggh

m+r

(70)

let us examine the possibility of an expression for the

(59)

current as

{b(,  ), c(,  )} = 2 (  )
and are quantized with the mode expansions

c =



x

cn ein( )

b =



x

bn ein( )

(60)

(61)

the canonical anticommutator relations for cns and bns
are

{cm, bn} = m+n

{cm, cn} = {bm, bn} = 0

(62)

(63)

deriving the energy momentum tensor from the action
and making the mode expansion, the virasoro generators
for the ghosts (g) are



lg

m =

xn=

(m  n) bm+n cn  a m

(64)

where a is the normal ordering constant. these genera-
tors satisfy the algebra

ggh

r =xn

bn+rcn

(71)

n takes only integral values whereas r is half integral.
bn+r is therefore outside the ghost sector. it has a con-
formal dimension of 5/2 so that ggh
r has the correct con-
formal dimension 3/2. the commutator

[lg

m, bn+r] =(cid:18) 3

2

m  n  r(cid:19) bn+r+m

(72)

is easily evaluated demanding that equation (70) be sat-
ised. from jacobi identity (65)

{ggh

r , ggh

s } = 2lg
the total current generator is

r+s + r+sbg(r)

gr = gm

r + ggh
r

(73)

(74)

thus we have the anomaly free super virasoro algebra,

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n

[lm, gr] = (m/2  r)gr+m

[gr, gs] = 2lr+s

(75)

(76)

(77)

[lg

m, lg

n ] = (m  n) lg

m+n + ag(m) m+n

the anomaly term is deduced as before and give

ag(m) =

(m  13m3) + 2a m
with a = 1, this anomaly term becomes

ag(m) =

3 (cid:18)r2

(65)

(66)

(67a)

(67b)

thus from the usual conformal eld theory we have ob-
tained the algebra of a superconformal eld theory. this
is the novelty of the present formulation. the brst [13]
charge operator is

qbrst =



x

lm
m cm 

1
2



x

(m  n) : cm cn bm+n : a c0

(78)

and is nilpotent for a = 1. the physical states are such
that qbrst |physi = 0.

the central charge is 26 and cancels the normal ordder
a(m) and b(r) of the l and g generators. noting that

[lg

m, cn] = (2m + n)cn+m

(68)

it is possible to construct an equation for the generator
for the current of the ghost sector,

mass null physical state with l0 | i = f 2
simply

0 | i = 0 is

| i = l1 | i

(89)

with l1 | i = f1 | i = 0. the next excited state with
(l0 + 1 i) becomes the same as in the bosonic sector.
obtained from the condition l1 | i = 0,

| i = (l2 +

the norm h | i = (c  26)/2 and vanishes for c = 26.
it is easy to check that all physical state conditions are
satised. f1 | i = 2 [l1, f0] | i = 0 since l1 | i = 0
and f0 | i =| i l2 | i = f1f1 | i = 0 and f2 |
i = [l2, f0] | i = 0. for c = 26, there are no negative
norm states in the ramond sector as well.
the ghose curreent in the ramond sector satises the

the ramond sector virasoro algebra is the same as the
ns-sector with the replacement of gs by fs. it is neces-
sary to dene lo suitably to keep the anomaly equations
the same [9].

in this ramond sector, a physical state | i should

satisfy

(85)

the normal order anomaly constant in the anticom-
mutables of the ramond current generators has to be
evaluated with care, beacuse the denation of f0 does
not have a normal ordering ambiguity. so f 2
0 = l0. us-
ing commutation relation (43) with g replaced by f and
the jacobi identity we get

{fr, fr} =

so

a physical state in the fermionic sector satises

it follows that

(86)

(87)

(88)

(f 2

0  1) | i = (f0  1)(f0 + 1) | i = 0

the construction of

null physical states becomes
much simpler beacuse all fm terms can be assigned
to lm terms by the commution ration fm =
2[f0, lm]/m and f0 has eigen values which are roots of
eigen values of l0 acting on the generic states or states
constructed out of the quadratic states. thus the zero

we can construct f gh
object n which satisfy

0 with the help of an anti commuting

{n, m} = 2m,n

(92)

it is important to write lg
as

0 in terms of positive integrals

lg

0 =



xn=1

n(bncn + cnbn)

(93)

it is found that

f gh

0 =



xn=1

nn(bncn + cnbn)

(94)

all other fs can be constructed by the use of the equa-
tions of super virasoro algebra.

the ghost current
from equation (67) and (86),
anomaly constant is bg(r) =  26
3 (r2  1) and cancels
out the b(r) of equation(87). the total current anoma-
lies in both the sectors vanish.

viii. the mass spectrum

the ghosts are not coupled to the physical states.
therefore the latter must be of the form (up to null state)
[15].

|{n} pim  c1|0ig

(95)

|{n} pim denotes the occupation numbers and momen-
tum of the physical matter states. the operator c1 lowers
the energy of the state by one unit and is necessary for
brst invariance. the ghost excitation is responsible
for lowering the ground state energy which produces the
tachyon.

where s will be the jacobi theta functions (,  ) [18],
q = ei and ( )(2) = 1/3

functions of seiberg and witten for the twenty four un-

therefore, the mass shell condition is

due to the presence of ramond and neveu-schwartz
sectors with periodic and anti-periodic boundary condi-
tions, we can eect a gso projection [16] on the mass
spectrum on the nsr model [17]. here the projection
should refer to the unprimed and primed quantas sepa-
rately. the desired projection is

(100)

g =

1
4

(1 + (1)f )(1 + (1)f 
r  b

)

where f = p br  br; f  = p b

r . this elimi-
nates the half integral values from the mass spectrum by
choosing g=1.

for closed strings we have a similar separation as in
eq. (95), namely the left-handed states will be in the
form

|{n} pim  c1|0ig

the mass spectrum can be written as

1
2

m 2 = n + n  1  1

(101)

(102)

ix. modular invariance

the gso projection is necessary for the modular in-
variance of the theory. we follow the notation of seiberg
and witten [18]. following kaku [17], the spin structure
(,  ) for a single fermion is given by
(,  ) = q1/24 t r q2pn

n nn = q1/24



yn=1

a((++). ) = 0 .

(107)

it is easily checked that the sum

a( ) = (3( )/( ))12  (2( )/( ))12  (4( )/( ))12
(108)

is modular invariant, using the properties of the theta
functions given in [18].

for the twenty primed oscillators it is not so straight-
forward because of the ambiguity of fractional powers of
unity. if we prescribe a normalization 1 = 11/2 = e2i,
then

a((),  ) = (( )/( ))10 ,
a((+),  ) = ei(2( )/( ))10 ,
a((+),  ) = ei(4( )/( ))10 ,

a((++),  ) = 0 .

(109)

(110)

(111)

(112)

3 ( ) + ei10

2 ( ) + ei10

the sum (10
4 ( ))/10( ) is
also modular invariant upto the factor of cube root and
fractional roots of unity. the sum of the modulii is, of
course, modular invariant.
it is easy to construct the
modular invariant partition function for the two physical
bosons, namely

pb( ) = (im  )22( ) 2( ) ,

(113)

in four dimensions [20]. for normal ordering constant
is 1 in q2(l01) , 2/12 comes from the bosons and
44/24 comes from the fermions adding to 1 for both
ns and r sectors.

x. space-time supersymmetry

let us construct the vector state of zero mass as

(114)
the condition p2 = 0 and l1|i = 0 gives the equation
of motion and lorentz condition,


1|0ie(p) .

p2e = 0

and pe = 0

the ramond fermion give a state
d
1|0i(p) .

(115)

(116)

(p) is a dirac spinor of zero mass,  are the usual
dirac gamma matrices. the condition f1|i = 0 gives
the dirac equation

  p (p) = 0 .

(117)

1/2b,k
b,k

1/2|0ih 

kk (p)

(121)

from the condition f1|i = 0 we have ph  = ph  =
ph  = ph  = 0. there are many vectors
and scalars. the vectors are like pa
jj  and
pa
kk . the potentials saties the equation
a
jj = 0 and a
kk = 0. the
(i, j) and (k, k) antisymmetric parts are the 15 and 10
of so(6) and so(5) respectively.

are

also

1 |0i

the massless ramond spinors
there
d,j
1|0ij six in number, and d,k
k, ve in num-
ber. so in the product space there are 30 chiral spinors
which exactly correspond to the 15 chiral fermions and
15 chiral antifermions in one generation of the standard
model. the particles, er, ur, dr, (, e)l and (u, d)l and
their antiparticles can be assigned the usual quantum
numbers under gst. the gst with fteen fermions is
exactly space-time super-symmetric has been proven in
reference [22] recently.

the bosonic degrees of freedom match the fermionic de-
grees of freedom.

the fteen ramond fermions ca be placed in ve

groups each containing three particles

1|0if  and 

for closed strings a similar analysis can be made with
d

1|0i following the details

given by g.s.o., we get a massless antisymmetric tensor ,
massless scalar and a massless symmetric tensor (spin 2)
adding upto 4 degrees of freedom. the fermionic sector
contains a massless spin 3/2 and a massless 1/2 adding
upto a total of four degrees of freedom as has been shown
by g.s.o. for the four dimensional case.

xi. approach to standard model

the main motivation of constructing this theory is to
see if the internal symmetry group makes contact with
the standard model which explains all experimental data
upto date with a high degree of accuracy. the internal
symmetry of the group was so(44). we have divided
them into four so(11)s and further subdivided to so(6)
and so(5). according to slansky [21] we can have the
breaking

so(11)  so(6)  so(5)  gst

(118)

where

gst = suc(3)  sul(2)  uy (1)  u (1) .

(119)

this has the content of the standard model with an addi-
tional gauge boson. the 15 gauge elds of so(6) and 10
gauge elds of so(5) are contained in the states h 
jj  (p)
and h 
 = 0) with the struc-
ture

kk (p) which are massless (p2

with the help of the diagonal su (3) gallmann matrices
8 and 3 and isospin i3, one can construct a matrix
operator qc = i3 + 1
values for the rst four sets and zero eigen values for the
courless leptons.

4 (38  3) which has three eigen

it is of interest to note that higgs boson is classically
tachyonic. we cannot show that there are three gener-
ations of fermions. perhaps it is related to the number
of ways the 30 chiral fermions can be placed under gst.
there are many aspects which are not clear to us, but we
have made out a case to study this model further to re-
late gravity and standard model through string theory
with a unique vacuum.

we have proted from discussions with dr. j. maha-
rana and dr. s. mahapatra. the library, computer
and other facilities extended by institute of physics,
