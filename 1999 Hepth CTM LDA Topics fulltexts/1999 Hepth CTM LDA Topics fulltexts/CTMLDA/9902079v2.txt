abstract

we study a wess-zumino-witten model with target space ads3(s3s3s1)/z2.
this allows us to construct space-time n = 3 superconformal theories. by combining
left-, and right-moving parts through a gso and a z2 projections, a new asymmetric
(n ,n ) = (3, 1) model is obtained. it has an extra gauge (kac-moody) su (2) symme-
try in the target space of the type iia string. an associated conguration is realized

as slantwise intersecting m5-o6-m2 branes in the m-theory viewpoint.

1 introduction

one of the most interesting dualities is the correspondence between supergravity theories
(sugra) on adsd+1  m and the d-dimensional conformal eld theories (cft). many
in an excellent paper
intensive researches are in progress in various dimensional cases.

by j. maldacena[1], enhancements of the rigid supersymmetries are proposed in the near-

horizon geometries on anti-de sitter (ads) spaces of the sugra. these theories in the limits

are conjectured to be identied with boundary conformal eld theories, for an instance, the
4 dimensional n = 4 susy yang-mills theory realized on a boundary of ads5 in type iib
sugra.

boundary geometries in other dimensions are also believed to have these enlarged sym-

metries and a better understanding of these equivalences is expected to have numerous ap-

plications to strongly coupled gauge theories and could make clear dynamics in the regions.

it might be a realization of the profound problem that the dynamics of the supergravity

theories are eectively controlled by large n susy yang-mills theory in some limit of large

solitonic charges. in order to unify various string dualities, it could give us a clue to for-

mulate some fundamental theory by taking d-branes as fundamental objects. for instances,

classical solutions in ads4-,ads7-backgrounds are currently investigated in the context of
the m-theory.

but most of the works in this subject are restricted to situations where the classical low

energy approximation of the sugra is reliable. also turning on ramond-ramond (rr)

backgrounds make it dicult to study these ads/cf t correspondences.

in contrast, three dimensional case is special in many respects and analyses of ads3
gravity is lifted to those in a stringy level on this background. it supplies a chance for us

to establish this correspondence in quantum levels. first, in this case the associated cft

is two dimensional and has innite dimensional local symmetries. that makes it possible to

allow us to several fruitful results through concrete calculations.

second, string theory on ads3 can be dened without turning on rr-elds and should
be more amenable to traditional worldsheet methods. in fact by performing an s-duality

on the type iib background with rr-elds, we obtain a perturbative string theory with

only ns-ns elds turned on. the conformal invariance on the worldsheet of rst quantized

superstring leads to a classical solution of sugra. that is to say, the ads3/cf t2 corre-
spondence in stringy level is reduced to an equivalence between the worldsheet cft and the

space-time (boundary) cft. from the point of view of perturbative string theory on ads3,
giveon et al.[2] have constructed directly superconformal generators in the space-time cft

in terms of physical vertex operators of the worldsheet cft. recently there are some further

1

developments along this line[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

r-symmetries of space-time susy theories are reected in isometries of subspaces of the m.
most typical examples are illustrated in s3, s3  s3, s5 cases whose isometry groups
are su(2), su(2)su(2), so(6) = su(4) respectively. there are space-time small n = 4
(2 dim), large n = 4 (2 dim), and n = 4 (4dim) superconformal symmetries associated
to them. when one reduces isometries of these spaces, less supersymmetric theories can

be obtained in space-time. in order to carry out this program, a simple useful method is

proposed to divide the subspace in term of some discrete groups [12]. by applying this
method to the 5 dimensional case, that is, ads5  s5/ sugra, space-time n =0, 1, 2, 4
theories are obtained approximately in the leading order of large n limits.

in general, two dimensional case is better understood than other higher dimensional

analogues. we hope to that the division method will be available in order to construct less
(n < 4) superconformal theories for 2 dimensional cases without approximations, namely,
in all orders of the large n expansions.

motivated with this consideration, we focus on the superstring theory on ads3 back-
ground and intend to examine space-time n = 3 superconformal generators in term of a
wess-zumino-witten (wzw) model. many considerations have been given for (small/large)
n = 4 space-time scft in ads3 models[2, 9, 8, 11]. but there still remains several uncertain
points for space-time less susy models. our aim is to develop a concrete applicable method
to construct less susy models in ads3 string. we present n = 3 space-time generators
explicitly and investigate associated brane congurations.

the purpose of this paper is to continue this study to establish ads3/cf t2 correspon-
dence in less susy models and to apply it to some additional examples that are of interest in

the dierent contexts.

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we shortly review the formulation in

gkss paper and its possible generalizations for direct product target spaces. we also

explain the wakimotos representations[13] of kac-moody currents and associated wzw

models in order to x our conventions in the paper. we propose a orbifold-type model in

the superstring as a new class with an ads3 background. taking a z2-division on a product
space s3  s3  s1, we construct space-time n = 3 superconformal theories on its xed
locus, that is, a diagonal s3
d space. it is an extension of the work[2] to less space-time susy
theories. by imposing several physical conditions, we can obtain space-time generators in

terms of worldsheet operators in the rst quantized superstring. the algebra is represented
linearly and its global part turns out to be a super lie algebra osp(3|2). a bosonic part
sl(2; r)sud(2) is associated with an isometry of the sigma model target space ads3s3
d.

2

we elaborate some aspects of this model and comment on a proposed identication. we also
present modes of space-time n = 3 scft generators towards understandings of the spectra
of space-time fock spaces. as concrete examples, we analyse chiral primary elds in this

algebra and construct them explicitly.

next we combine these left-moving n = 3 sca and right-moving correspondings in the
type iia superstring. chiralities of two-sides are opposite because of a gso projection and
the resulting theory turns out to have an exotic (n ,n ) = (3, 1) supersymmetry in space-
in addition to the n = 1 virasoro symmetry, we observe that the right-side part
time.
has an extra n = 1 su(2) super kac-moody algebra associated with the isometry of the
remaining diagonal s3
d.

in section 3, we introduce a brane conguration whose near horizon geometry will serve

as ads3 background for string propagation. the conguration includes m5, m2, and o6
branes. we describe the supergravity solution and its near horizon limit. in fact by shrinking
the radius of a longitudinal circle s1, the geometry in the m-theory becomes the orbifold-

type space with a z2-action in the type iia theory explored in section 2. the conformal
symmetries are realized on a z2-xed plane o6 in this classical solution. we will also explain
relations between radii of the space and the levels of algebras proposed in [2].

section 4 is devoted to conclusions and comments.

in appendix a, we collect several

conventions for spin operators and cocycle factors.

2 superstring on ads3  (s3  s3  s1)/z2

the two dimensional cft has innite dimensional symmetries and is investigated in detail.

the relations between ads3 gravity and the 2dim cft are expected to be understood much
deeper than those in other dimensions. the isometry group of the ads3 space is so(2, 2),
but the asymptotic symmetry of them is enhanced to 2dim boundary conformal algebra.

this asymptotic symmetry acts on the background elds evaluated at spatial innity and

leaves them invariant. the well-known example is the btz black holes[14] in ads3 and their
associated boundary isometry is generated by two commuting virasoro algebras[15, 14]. its

central charge is characterized by 3dim newton constant g3 and a radius  of ads3 as
3
[15, 16]. also these relations with cft are not only established in the ads3 sugra,
2g3
but also are lifted to those at the level in string theory propagating on ads3. in the context
of the latter, asymptotic virasoro generators are constructed by worldsheet operators in

the rns formalisms in [2]. let us review these shortly and consider possible target spaces

3

allowed by consistency conditions.

2.1 general case

first we restrict ourselves to n = 1 wzw models with target spaces of the direct product
type

ads3  yi=1

gi , ads3 = sl(2; r) .

here gis are either compact simple groups or abelian u(1) groups. the dimension of each
gi is di and its dual coxeter number hi . at the quantum level, n = 1 susy kac-moody
algebra is realized and associated level is ki for gi. then central charge ci is calculated as

ci = 3
2 

hi

ki! di .

(we refer i = 0 to an index associated with g0 = sl(2; r) group.) a constraint is given as
a conformal anomaly free condition that expresses a balance of the central charges amongst

ghost parts and matter parts

c = xi=0  3

2 

hi

ki! di = 15 .

there is also a relation about a total dimension

10 = xi=0

di .

(2. 1)

(2. 2)

with p =h dz

similarly the space-time boundary ane algebra is expected to have a central charge c = 6kp
2i 1. the  is a scalar appearing in the wakimoto representation[13] of the
sl(2; r) currents. a level of boundary kac-moody algebra ki is proportional to the level
ki of the associated algebra, ki = kip. thus eqs.(2. 1)(2. 2) lead us to relations between
space-time kac-moody and virasoro algebras

62
c

= xi=1

hi di
ki

, xi=1

di = 7 .

we can write down all possible cases satisfying these conditions:

1. sl(2; r)  u(1)7
2. sl(2; r)  su(2)  u(1)4
3. sl(2; r)  su(2)  su(2)  u(1)  ads3  s3  s3  s1 .

 ads3  t 7
 ads3  s3  t 4

in the case 1., the level of sl(2; r) algebra is innite (k = 0) and the radius of ads3 blows
up. it is a decompactifying limit of ads3 and corresponds to a at space-time.

4

the model in case 2. corresponds to an elaborated near horizon limit of the d1-d5 system.
the small n = 4 cft is realized as space-time asymptotic symmetry. the ads3/cf t2
correspondence is investigated in the framework of type iib superstring in [2]. here (small)
n = 4 superconformal generators are constructed from the worldsheet vertex operators.

similarly a large n = 4 scft is constructed in the model in case 3.[9]. the associated

space-time central charge c is expressed by levels k1, k2 of two su(2)s

c =

6k1k2
k1 + k2

,

as required in a unitary n = 4 theory.

in the context of worldsheet theory, we have other types of possible models.

in the

following, we concentrate on a orbifold-type case and analyse its associated space-time su-

perconformal theory.

2.2 n = 3 superconformal algebra
in this paper we propose a orbifold type model, that is, a superstring theory on the ads3 
(s3  s3  s1)/z2 as a new class with an ads3 background. we explore it and construct
space-time n = 3 superconformal algebras.

the string metric of the ads3-part is expressed with polar coordinates (, , )

ds2 = 2(d2 + e2dd) ,

where  is the radius of the ads3 space and can be regarded as ns5 brane charges. this
model also has non-vanishing ns-ns 2-form bn s background

bn s = 2e2d  d .

in the wzw model, we can incorporate this metric and the bn s into a worldsheet lagrangian
in the quantum corrected form. the bosonic part of the theory can be written with scalars
,  and auxiliary elds ,  with worldsheet spins 1

r(2) +   +     exp 

2

+! ,

2
+

l =   
+ = 2k  4 , (k = ks +2) .

this worldsheet theory has an sl(2; r) kac-moody symmetry with level1 k = ks + 2 and
its generators {j a

b} are expressed in the wakimoto representation[13]

1the radius  of ads3 is related to the level k of the sl(2; r) ane algebra 2 = k2

s, (s = ).

free elds ( , ) and  have non-vanishing short distance behaviors only in the following

cases

(z)(w)   log(z  w) .

next we prepare a set of free fermions {a} (a = +,, 3) with opes

a(z)b(w)

these elds are combined into a set of sl(2; r) kac-moody currents j a

bcbc , (a = +,, 3) ,

they constitute fermionic parts of an n = 1 sl(2; r) super kac-moody algebra with a
level ks. it is generated by a set of total currents j a = j a

b + j a
f .

we apply the same recipe to describe two s3 parts of the model by two su(2) ane
currents. bosonic parts are generated by two sets of currents k (i)a (i = 1, 2 ; a = +,, 3)

k (i)b = (i) ,

in order to construct fermionic parts of the currents k (i)a
, we prepare two sets of fermions
(i)a (i = 1, 2 ; a = +,, 3). one can combine them into n = 1 su(2) kac-moody currents
with level 2

the total currents for each s3 are dened as k (i)a = k (i)a
(i = 1, 2 ; a = +,, 3)
with a level k. a set of a boson y and a fermion  describes a string propagating on s1 and
associated currents are given by y and .

now let us consider an anomaly free conditions, that is, a criticality condition of string
k and u(1) kac-moody

theory. the matter parts in this system contain sl(2; r)ks , su(2)(i)
algebras and their centers must be balanced with those of ghost parts

it leads to a relation among two levels ks =

n = 1 superconformal currents t (z) (energy momentum tensor) and g(z) (super stress
tensor)

(2. 3)

now we shall explain the z2-action of our model. in order to leave operators invariant under
an exchange of two su(2)s, we set an action of the z2 as

( k (1) , k (2) , y )  ( k (2) , k (1) , y ) ,

where the ( k (1) , k (2) , y ) is a set of coordinates of s3  s3  s1. this operation picks
up only diagonal part of the su(2)  su(2) algebra and an isometry su(2)  su(2) of
large n = 4 is reduced to a diagonal sud(2) only. this turns out to generate an n = 3
superconformal algebra.

first the diagonal sud(2) is invariant under the z2 action and associated ane lie

algebra is constructed by summing two su(2)s

k a = k (1)a + k (2)a .

the worldsheet sud(2) generates a kac-moody algebra with a level kso = 2k = 4ks. that
is to say, the diagonal s3 has a radius skso = 2sks, which is twice as large as the
radius (sks) of the ads3.

by using this current, we can introduce mode operators of a space-time su(2) kac-moody

current t a

the  is the bosonized super-reparametrization ghost. this space-time ane algebra has a

also modes of a virasoro operator lm have the following formula in the 0-picture

lm = i dz

they satisfy space-time commutation relations with a central charge c = 3kp and two central
terms are associated as c =

kso.

next the space-time fermionic generators are constructed from spin operators[17] in the

worldsheet theory. we have ten free fermions in the associated super wzw model with the
target space ads3  s3  s3  s1:
ads3

1 , 2 , 3 ,

 .

supercharges (spin operators) before the z2-operation transform with (2 , 2) representation
of the su(2)  su(2). they are decomposed into 3 + 1 representations under the sud(2).
the z2-action projects out the singlet and survives the triplet transforming with (2 , 3)
fermionic generators in the sl(2; r)  sud(2). in order to pick up z2-invariant parts, we
introduce next combinations

1 = 1 ,
3 = (1)1 ,
5 = (2)1 ,
7 = 12
9 = 12

((1)3 + (2)3) ,
((1)3  (2)3) ,

2 = 2 ,
4 = (1)2 ,
6 = (2)2 ,
8 = i3 ,
10 =  ,

and will bosonize these fermions

1  i2 = 2eih1 , 3  i4 = 2eih2 ,
5  i6 = 2eih3 , 7  i8 = 2eih4 ,
9  i10 = 2eih5 .

8

then spin elds s are dened in the (1/2)-picture as

s = exp  i
2xi

c ; cocycle factor .

ih i! c ,

the i (i = 1, 2,   , 5) takes its value 1. these elds have non-trivial opes

1

e(cm )m ,

e/2s(z)e/2s(w) 
1
m (z)s(w) 
with
cm c1 = (m )t , c t = c, c 2 = 1 .

z  w
2(z  w)1/2
{m , n} = 2m n ,

s(m )

 ,

here m s are so(10) gamma matrices and the c is a matrix representation of a charge

conjugation operator. also several concrete expressions are put in order in an appendix a.

one can introduce a notation u(z) to represent general types of spinors

we can express operator product expansions of the u(z) and m as

u(z) =x

s(z)u .

m (z)u(w)

2(z  w)1/2

s(m )

u.

as operations on the us, the operators m can be identied with the (1/2)m .

naively there seems to be possible 32 spin operators, but we have to constraint several

physical conditions on them. the rst is the brs condition and it acts on the u(z). an

associated part of this is described by an operator g

g = i128 +

gu = 0 .

1
2

34(7 + 9) +

56(7  9) ,

the second condition comes from a gso projection operator 11

11 = i12    10 ,
11u = +u .

(2. 4)

(2. 5)

one can impose a positive chirality condition on the left-part in the worldsheet 11u = +u

only if the number of minus signs of i is even. namely, only spinor representation is survived
in this projection. oppositely a negative chirality condition leads to pick up some sets {i}
with odd number of minus signs. it corresponds to a co-spinor representation.

9

the last constraint is reduced to the z2 projection . this z2 operation acts on

fermionic elds as

(3 , 5)  (5 , 3) ,
(4 , 6)  (6 , 4) ,
(9 , 10)  (9 , 10) ,
m  m , (m = 1, 2, 7, 8) ,

and is described by an operator 

1
2

with

910(3 + 5)(4 + 6)3456 ,

2

 = 1 .

z2-invariant spinors must be selected out by a condition

u = +u .

(2. 6)

now we make a remark here: the operator  picks up a triplet in the sud(2). but we can
equivalently project out a triplet but leave a singlet invariant by using another z2-projection

f =  .

that leads to an n = 1 superconformal algebra as we will show in the next subsection.

we obtain physical spinor operators sa

r (a = 1, 2, 3, ; r = 1/2) satisfying the above

three conditions (2. 4),(2. 5),(2. 6)

the n = 3 superconformal algebra has a global subalgebra osp(3|2) whose bosonic part is
associated with an isometry of the ads3  s3. also super lie algebra osp(3|2) is an o(3)
extended anti-de sitter group in two dimension. modes of super stress tensors in space-time
transform with vector representation 3 of this o(3)  osp(3|2). it is contrasted with the
fact that the super stress tensors in the (small or large) n = 4 scft belong to spinor
representation of the lie algebra su(2)  su(1, 1|2) or su(1, 1|2) su(1, 1|2) respectively.

we have to impose a z2-invariant condition for the operators.
in this paper we restrict
ourselves to the j = j case, for simplicity. in this case, a relation j = j (= j) is automat-
ically satised, and the z2-invariant operators turn out to be the spin 2j representation of
the sud(2). moreover, the highest weight state of this multiplet corresponds to a space-time
primary state with space-time conformal dimension h = j and space-time su(2) spin j = 2j.
because of the relation 2h = j, it represents a chiral primary eld of the space-time n = 3
theory.

now we recall that the short multiplet of the n = 3 scft is constructed by multiplying

1/2, q0

1/2 to the chiral primary state |h, j = 2hi as shown in gure 1.

let us consider these space-time chiral primaries. first we perform a standard twisting
method to the space-time n = 3 superconformal algebra. all we have to do is to modify
modes ( lm, q0

in terms of the worldsheet cft, the currents j 3, k 3 are parts of some u(1) current j. also,

it is well-known that the n = 1 superconformal algebra (2. 3) is enhanced to an n = 2
cft generated by t , g = g+ + g and j in this coset case. now we concentrate on the
sud(2)kso/u(1) part. it is a special case of the grassmannian model

su(n + m)k

with n = m = 1 , k = kso .

now we make several remarks here: the level ks can be interpreted as the square of the
radius of the ads3. in our case, it is related with the kso = 4ks of the su(2) level and kso
must be integer. that is to say, the associated cfts are realized only on isolated integer

points on the kso line. when one xes the kso as some number, the associated cft has
at most nite number of primary elds representing degenerate vacua of landau-ginzburg

model. however we can formally resolve the degeneracy of the vacua by perturbation pre-

serving n = 2 symmetry. it is an interesting problem to make clarify connections between

the interpolating theory amongst dierent vacua and ads3 geometry.

2.3 n = 1 super kac-moody algebra

until now, we concentrate on the left-moving part of the worldsheet theory. it generates
a space-time n = 3 sca in the left-handed side.
in order to construct full theory, we
have to consider the remaining right-moving anti-holomorphic part. the same recipes2 can

be applied to this case in the bosonic parts. also one imposes conditions on right-moving

spinors u(z)

g u = 0 ,  u = +u ,

as physical conditions. but we have to impose a negative chirality condition (gso projection)

on the u

11 u = u ,

because we consider the type iia string. here, we nd that the selected spinors form the
n = 1 sca. we summarize possible choices of the gso and z2 projections and associated
space-time supersymmetries in the table 2.

here, we take a choice that the gso projection is    and z2 projection is  +  case.
then we get the n = 1 sca in the right-handed side. in fact these conditions select out
only two possible spin operators s1/2

they belong to a singlet representation of sud(2) and transform with a doublet of sl(2; r).
in this case, a triplet of sud(2) is projected out and only n = 1 algebra is retained. then

3 the brane conguration

in this section, we study a brane conguration realized by m5-branes, orientifold 6 planes
and m2-branes in m-theory and show that it has a near horizon geometry ads3  (s3 
s3  r)/z2  r. if the last real line r is compactied to a small circle s1, the geometry
becomes ads3  (s3  s3  r)/z2 in the iia theory considered in the previous section.

in the m5-o6-m2 system, each brane extends to space-time directions shown in a table

the o6 extends to oblique directions. for convenience to express this o6, we change

then extended directions of the m5s and the m2s are remained as in the table 4 in old

coordinates x. but the o6 is stretched in directions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, in the new coordinates

when we compactify the x10 direction to a small s1, we get a conguration with ns5-

o5-ns1 branes in the iia theory.

now we will consider a classical solution associated with this brane system. first we set
two kinds of m5-branes, m5(1) and m5(2), to be the same in number. this set-up makes a z2
action possible, which is generated by the o6 and exchanges m5(1)s and m5(2)s one another.
there is a metric of the classical solution in the m5(1)-m5(2)-m2 system[21] with the same

(m = 2, 3, 4, 5) .

so we can divide this space by the z2 and construct a classical m5-o6-m2 solution.

now let us take the near horizon limit and see what the geometry is. the limit magnies

regions in the ranges r1  r1 and r2  r1 and then the above metric becomes

study the geometry directly. to make the geometrical structure more clearly, we perform a

when we treat m-theory as 11-dimensional classical supergravity, we need to take the
limit r  p, where p is the 11-dimensional plank length. this is equivalent to a large n
limit,

also, in our solution, both radii of the two s3s are r. the parameter  is identied with

a radius of the ads3. they are connected by a relation

q2q5  1.

22 = r2 .

(3. 10)

it relates a level of the worldsheet ane algebra dsu(2)k with that of the dsl(2, r)ks

2ks = k.

now let us return to the z2 action. if we let (1)a and (2)a, (a = 1, 2, 3) to be coordinates

of s3(1) and s3(2) respectively, the z2 operation acts on them

(1)a  (2)a, (2)a  (1)a,

v  v.

here we nd that the z2 action considered in the previous section turns out be a natural
operation. after the division, we obtain a resulting space ads3  (s3  s3  r)/z2  r.
because the x10 direction is at in this geometry, we can compactify it to a small circle
s1. by decreasing the radius of the s1, the geometry in the m-theory is reduced to the
ads3  (s3  s3  r)/z2 in the type iia theory. it is just the same theory that we consider
in the previous section.

finally we comment on the xed plane o6. on this xed surface, next relations are

satised

(1)a = (2)a = a
3,
d(1)a = d(2)

a = da

v = 0,

dv = 0 .

the geometry of this surface is characterized as ads3  s3  r and its induced metric is
given as

2

u2{du2  (dx0)2 + (dx1)2} + 2r2(d3)2 +  r4

(dx10)2 .

a radius of s3 part is understood to be r = 2r. by comparing the radius  of ads3 with
this r, we obtain a relation between them. they are connected with an equation

42 = r2 .

it leads to give us a ratio of two levels of the worldsheet dsl(2, r)ks and the diagonal dsud(2)kso

as

kso
ks

r2
2 = 4 .

it matches with the results derived in the previous section.

in this brane conguration, the m2-brane ends on the m5s. the intersecting part is a

(1+1) dimensional object and represents a string. when one compacties one longitudinal

dimension, it is known as a little string[22] trapped in the ns5-brane in the context of the

20

small iia theory. the associated low energy theory is believed to be an exotic 6dim (2,0)

type iia susy theory. in our set-up, our susy model lives on an orientifold plane with these

m2-m5 backgrounds. we might have a new low energy susy theory with some additional

multiplets. we want to study these and clarify a description of them in the m(atrix) or

quiver matrix theory in future works.

4 conclusions and discussions

in this paper, we investigated the superstring on the background ads3  (s3  s3  s1)/z2
in the framework presented in [2] and developed a method to construct a conformal theory

with less supersymmetry in space-time. we study a wzw model on ads3 target space
with a z2-action and nd that an sl(2; r)  sud(2) isometry is enhanced to the n = 3
superconformal algebra in space-time. global symmetry part is a super lie algebra osp(3|2)
which is an o(3) extended anti-de sitter group in two dimension.

levels kso, ks associated with kac-moody algebras sud(2) and sl(2; r) respectively.
also gives us information that a ratio among the radii of the diagonal s3

the criticality condition in this superstring is equivalent to a relation kso = 4ks of two
it
d and ads3 is two.
in order to construct supercharges (spin operators), we used standard bosonization tech-

niques for worldsheet fermions. we imposed three constraints on these spin operators as

physical conditions. the rst is the usual brs condition. the second is reduced to the
z2-invariance condition. the z2-operation acts on two s3s and exchanges their associated
elds one another. under the z2-projection, a diagonal part of products of two s3s is sur-
vived and it serves as an r-symmetry of the space-time theory. it also changes signatures of
elds on the circle s1. the last condition comes from a gso projection.

when one imposes a positive chirality condition, only spinor representation is survived.

oppositely co-spinor operators are obtained under a negative chirality constraint. we have
four possible choices in signs for these two z2- and gso projections, that is, (+, +), (,),
(+,), (, +). the choices (+, +), (,) lead to n = 3 superconformal algebras in space-
time. these spin elds sa
r transform with (2, 3) in the sl(2; r)  sud(2). but in the
remaining two cases, possible spin operators transform with (2, 1) of sl(2; r)  sud(2)
and only n = 1 algebras are retained. they satisfy n = 1 superconformal algebra (sca)
combined with virasoro generators.

in the context of the iia string theory, the chiralities of supercharges are opposite in space-

time and the gso projections act on left-, right-moving parts with dierent signatures. the
resulting type iia theory has an (n ,n ) = (3, 1) superconformal symmetry in space-time

21

with an extra su(2) kac-moody algebra in the n = 1 part. the n = 1 part has a degree
of freedom of the diagonal s3
d, that is, su(2)d ane symmetry in space-time. we construct
modes of a set of these n = 1 sud(2) super kac-moody generators explicitly. the precise
physical meaning of this remains to be understood.

also we present physical vertex operators, in particular, chiral primary elds in the n = 3
scft. we study short multiplets of (chiral part of) the n = 3 theory. it has n = 1 doublet
1/2|h, 2his with marginal operators. a candidate for the space-
states and we identify q
time (n ,n ) = (3, 1) full theory is a orbifold type sigma model like some symmetric product
(more precisely hilbert schemes) of a compact space. in order to establish the ads3/cf t2
correspondence, we have to consider the total fock space of the space-time cft and make

clarify the properties of the space-time vacua.

next, from the point of view of worldsheet theory, we speculate about the roles of the
currents j 3, k 3 and about relations between n = 2 cp kso-model and ads3-model. there
are several integrable deformations in the context of the cft. for an example, we can deform

the theory by the most relevant operator associated with a kahler form of the cp model.

as another example, one can obtain toda-type theories by using chebyshev polynomials

and then their solitons connect dierent vacua.

in the viewpoint of m-theory, we present a brane conguration whose near horizon ge-

ometry describes the ads3 background. the geometry is obtained at the throat limit of
two dierently oriented coincident sets of m5-branes intersecting in one direction, together

with m2-branes and a set of o6-plane stretching to oblique directions. the two kinds of
m5-branes (m5(1), m5(2)) are mirror images one another and the xed locus is the o6-plane

itself. then the z2-action is induced by the o6 planes and acts on a classical solution of
the m2, m5(1), m5(2) system. by taking a large charge limit, we can obtain a near horizon
geometry ads3(s3(1)s3(2)r)/z2r with a natural z2 action (s3(1)  s3(2), r  r
). by shrinking the radius of a longitudinal direction r, we construct the orbifold-type space

with the z2-action in the iia theory.

the m2 brane ends on the m5 and the intersecting part is a (1 + 1) dimensional object.

when one compacties one longitudinal direction (in stringy limit), it is known as a little

string trapped in the ns5-brane.

in our set-up, conformal theory lives on an o5-plane

reduced from the o6 in the background with solitonic ns5-branes and little strings. we

might have a new exotic low energy susy gauge theory with some extra multiplets. the near

horizon region in this model is the same as an infrared limit for this gauge theory. it is a

challenging problem to analyse these in the m(atrix) model.

in this paper, for simplicity, we consider only a z2-action. however we would expect

22

that the method developed here is applicable to other general backgrounds with actions of

discrete groups. we would like to discuss these subjects elsewhere.

appendix a. so(10) gamma matrices

here we summarize the so(10) gamma matrices.

we choose a convention for gamma matrices m , (m = 1,   , 10)

1 = 1  1  1  1  1 ,
2 = 2  1  1  1  1 ,
3 = 3  1  1  1  1 ,
4 = 3  2  1  1  1 ,
5 = 3  3  1  1  1 ,
6 = 3  3  2  1  1 ,
7 = 3  3  3  1  1 ,
8 = 3  3  3  2  1 ,
9 = 3  3  3  3  1 ,
10= 3  3  3  3  2 ,

where the a, (a = 1, 2, 3) are the pauli matrices, and 1 is the 2  2 unit matrix described
as

1 =

0 1

1 0  , 2 =

0 i
i

0  , 3 =

0

1

0 1  , 1 =

1 0

0 1  .

these m s satisfy anti-commutation relations {m , n} = 2m n . the chirality operator
11 is expressed as

11 = i12    10 = 3  3  3  3  3.

also we dene a unitary matrix c representing a charge conjugation operation as

c = 2  1  2  1  2 .

this c satisfy following several relations

cm c1 = (m )t , c = c = c1 = c t .

then the cm is symmetric as a matrix.

in this paper, these representations of gamma matrices appear as cocycle factors in the

the following opes including spin elds

m (z)s(w) =

s(m )

 ,

e/2s(z)e/2s(w) 

e(cm )m .
