perconformal algebras su (2, 2|n ), (n = 1, 2, 4) in view of their dual role in the ads/scft

correspondence. some applications to kk spectra, non-perturbative states and stringy

states are given.

1. introduction

the classication of super poincare and super anti-de-sitter algebras [1,2,3] in diverse

dimensions has played a major role since the early days of supersymmetry and supergravity.

super poincare algebras have been widely used to classify supersymmetric eld the-

ories and in constructing generic supergravity theories in diverse dimensions and with

dierent numbers of supersymmetries [4]. their central extension (more precisely the cen-

tral extension of the supertranslational algebras) had a major role with the inclusion of

p-branes supergravity solutions; a particular case is related to the black hole classication

based on the bps properties of the solutions.

supergravity solutions for bps p-branes are considered to be limits of analogous

solutions in quantum theories of gravity, such as string theory or m-theory. however, in

certain cases, due to non renormalization theorems of n-extended supersymmetry, such

solutions are exact or at least reliable approximations of stringy or m-theory solutions.

the recent interplay between anti-de-sitter supergravity and conformal eld theories

follows from the conjectured duality [5] between the string (or m-theory) background

describing the adsp+2 horizon geometry [6] of black p-branes and the conformal eld

theory living on their world-volume, which can be thought as the ads-boundary. this

correspondence claims that the correlation functions of composite operators in the cft

can be computed as bulk green functions of ads states of supergravity or string theory

[7,8].

in the present discussion, we only consider the case of d3-branes in type iib super-

gravity. the world-volume theories are n = 1, 2, 4 4d superconformal eld theories [8,9]

and the corresponding bulk theory is type iib on ads5x5, for internal manifolds x5

giving n = 2, 4, 8 supergravities [10,11,12,13], respectively. operators in the scft are

associated with the kk excitations, coming from the harmonic expansion on x5.

these theories and their uirs are therefore related to the su (2, 2|n ) algebras for

n = 1, 2, 4 [14,15,16,17]. the case n = 4, as we will see, deserves a special treatment since

the u (1) factor of the u (n ) = u (1)su (n ) r-symmetry becomes an outer automorphism

of the superalgebra [18,19,17,20] (this is a particular case of the su (n |m ) superalgebra

with n = m ).

this contribution reviews the unitary bounds and multiplet shortening for highest

weight uirs of 4d superconformal algebras in view of the ads5/cft4 correspondence

[9,21,22]. special emphasis will be given to dierent properties of the n = 1, 2, 4 cases,

1

due to the dierent supersingleton representations [23,14,18,19]. the latter are the basic

degrees of freedom of the superconformal theories on the boundary. in this respect, the

pioneering work of moshe flato, in collaboration with chistian frnsdal, has a crucial role

in this analysis. the above authors extended, in particular, the unitary bounds of uirs

of su (2, 2) to su (2, 2|1), and classied the multiplet shortenings, which just correspond

to the thresholds of the unitary bounds [14]. extension of this analysis came later [18,19]

and is the latter that we will use in the context of the ads5/cft4 correspondence.

in sections ii and iii, the unitarity bounds for n = 1, 2, 4 will be reviewed. uirs

satisfying these bounds have an interpretation in terms of superconformal boundary elds

[8,9,24]. some examples will be discussed. more importantly, the case of multiplet short-

ening corresponds to cft operators of protected dimensions. this happens either if a

boundary operator is a conserved current, thus corresponding to a massless bulk eld, or if

it is a shortened multiplet of the chiral type [8,25]. intermediate multiplets which are not

chiral also exist that have protected dimensions [21,22]. they can be formally obtained by

the product of a conserved supercurrent with a chiral operator.

for extended superconformal algebras with n = 2, 4 a new (exceptional) series of

shortened multiplets also exists which has no analogous in n = 1. this has to do with the

fact that n = 2 and n = 4 algebras admit self-conjugate supersingletons representations

[16,18,19] (unlike the n = 1 case).

in section iv, the application of dierent type of shortened multiplets to dierent

boundary conformal eld theories will be given. shortened multiplets allow to make a

detailed comparison between the ads5 bulk theory and the boundary superconformal

eld theory. particular examples are the n = 4 kk towers [11,26,8,24], corresponding

to an exceptional series of the n = 4 superalgebra as well as multitrace operators of

the n = 4 yang-mills theory [27], some of them having protected dimensions [27,28,29].

a richer structure exists for n = 1 superconformal theories where shortened multiplets

with anomalous dimensions can appear with precise associated supergravity states. this

is the case for x5 = t 1,1 = su (2)  su (2)/u (1), unique example [12] of a smooth

manifold where both the bulk and the boundary theories have been worked out in full

detail [30,31,32,22,33].

2

2. the unitary representations and shortening for su (2, 2|n ), n = 1, 2

in this section we consider the unitarity bounds for the highest-weight representations

of the su (2, 2|n ) superalgebra.

for the case of the su (2, 2) algebra itself, a given uir is denoted, following flato

and frnsdal [23,14,34], as d(e0, j1, j2) where e0, j1, j2 are the quantum number of

the highest-weight state [16], given by a nite uir of the maximal compact subgroup

su (2)  su (2)  u (1). the uirs fall in three series [35,5,36],

a) j1j2 6= 0

b) j2j1 = 0

c) j1 = j2 = 0

e0  2 + j1 + j2

e0  1 + j

e0 = 0

(2.1)

in the bulk interpretation, the inequality corresponds to massive representations in ads5,

the bound in a) corresponds to massless bulk particles of spin j1 + j2 while the bound in

b) corresponds to singletons of spin j.

note that in the ads/cft correspondence the bulk-boundary quantum numbers

(e0, j1, j2) refer to the compact basis for the ads states, while they refer to the non-

compact basis sl(2, c) o(1, 1) for the boundary conformal operators [8,17]. the highest

weight state in ads corresponds to a conformal operator o(x) at x = 0, so the ads

energy e0 corresponds to the conformal dimension 0 and the (j1, j2) quantum numbers

correspond to the lorentz spin of o(x).

in the cft, the bound a) corresponds to conformal conserved currents of spin j =

j1 + j2,

e0 = 2 + j1 + j2

1 1 j1...2j1 , 1... 2j2 (x) = 0,

j1j2 6= 0

(2.2)

while the bound b) corresponds to massless spin j conformal elds on the boundary,

e0 = 1 + j

1 1 o1...2j = 0

 2o(x) = 0

j 6= 0

j = 0

(2.3)

the case c) corresponds to the identity representation.

let us now consider the case of su (2, 2|n ) superalgebras [15,18]. in this case, the

highest weight state is denoted by d(e0, j1, j2; r, a1, ..., an 1) where the quantum numbers

in the bracket denote a uir of su (2, 2)  u (1)  su (n ), r being the quantum number

3

of the u (1) r-symmetry and a1, ..., an 1 the dynkin labels of a uir of the non-abelian

symmetry su (n ). we will denote by r the u (1) inside u (n ).

note that for n 6= 4, the su (2, 2|n ) algebra is essentially the same as p u (2, 2|n ),

since the supertrace generator of u (2, 2|n ) (which is a central charge) can be eliminated

by a redenition of the u (1) generator r of u (n ) [18,19]. this redenition is not however

possible for n = 4 since r drops from the supersymmetry anti-commutators and it becomes

an outer automorphism of the algebra [19,37,20].

in this case we have therefore two

inequivalent algebras, p su (2, 2|4) and p u (2, 2|4), depending whether r = 0 or r 6= 0.

we therefore adopt the convention that r is always the quantum number of the u (1)

generator of p u (2, 2|n ), so it will be the u (1) subgroup of u (n ) for n = 1, 2 while it will

be a central u (1) for n = 4.

in the boundary cft language, uirs can be realized as conformal superelds. the

superhighest weight state corresponds to a supereld (x, ) at x =  = 0 [18,24,9].

the unitarity bounds for su (2, 2|1) were found by flato and frnsdal [14]. they

generalize the cases a),b) and c) of eq. (2.1). they are,

a)

e0  2 + 2j2 + r  2 + 2j1  r

(or j1  j2, r  r)

j1, j2  0

(2.4)

which implies

e0  2 + j1 + j2,

r  j1  j2,

2 + 2j1  e0  r  e0  2  2j2

(2.5)

b)

e0 = r  2 + 2j  r

(j2 = 0, j1 = j, or j1 = 0, j2 = j, r  r)

(2.6)

which implies e0  1 + j,

c)

e0 = j1 = j2 = r = 0

(2.7)

which corresponds to the identity representation.

shortening in the case a) corresponds to

e0 = 2 + 2j2 + r,

(r  j1  j2)

(or j1  j2, r  r)

(2.8)

this is a semi-long ads5 multiplet [21] or, in conformal language, a semiconserved super-

eld [38,22],

d 1 l1...2j1 , 1... 2j2 (x, , ) = 0,

( d2l1...2j1 = 0 for j2 = 0)

(2.9)

4

(in our conventions  carries  = 1/2, r = 1,  has  = 1/2, r = 1).

maximal shortening in case a) corresponds to e0 = 2 + j1 + j2, r = j1  j2. this is

a conserved supereld which satises both left and right constraints:

d 1 j1...2j1 , 1... 2j2 = d1 j1...2j1 , 1... 2j2 = 0

(2.10)

the shortening in b) corresponds to chiral superelds. maximal shortening in b) to

massless chiral superelds, i.e. chiral singleton representations: e0 = r = 1 + j. the

corresponding supereld, for e0 = r satises,

and, for e0 = 1 + j, it also satises

d s1...2j = 0

ds1...2j = 0

(d2s = 0, for j = 0)

(2.11)

(2.12)

these equations are the supersymmetric version of (2.2) and (2.3).

we may call, with an abuse of language, o-shell singletons chiral superelds in the

sense that in an interacting conformal eld theory singletons may acquire anomalous di-

mension and fall in (2.11).

it is also evident, from supereld multiplication, that by suitable multiplication of

several free supersingletons one may get any other supereld of type (2.9), (2.10) or (2.11).

note that superelds obeying (2.9),(2.11) may have anomalous dimensions since the

shortening condition just implies a relation between e0 and r without xing their value.

the basic singleton multiplets for n = 1 gauge theories correspond to j = 0, 1/2

in (2.11), i.e. chiral scalar superelds s (wess-zumino multiplets) and yang-mills eld

strength multiplets w. any other conformal operator is obtained by suitable multiplica-

tion of these two sets of basic superelds.

in type iib on t 1,1 long, semi-long and chiral multiplets do indeed occur [30,31,22].

chiral wz singleton multiplets have in this case an anomalous dimension  = 1/4 ( =

1 + ) and r-symmetry r = 3/4.

if we adopt the concept of bulk masslessness as corresponding to an uir that is con-

tained in the product of two supersingletons there are other massless bulk representations

which are obtained by chiral multiplication of two singleton representations,

d(1 + j1, j1, 0; 1 + j1)  d(1 + j2, j2, 0; 1 + j2) = d(2 + j1 + j2, j, 0; 2 + j1 + j2)

|j1  j2|  j  j1 + j2

(2.13)

5

these representations do not occur in the ads/scft correspondence unless j1 = 0, j2 =

0, 1/2 since they do not correspond to global symmetries of the scft. one can indeed
show that the symmetry of n = 1 sym theory, as in the dual of type iib on ads5  t 1,1,

do not allow such uirs.

we now turn to the su (2, 2|2) superalgebra. in this case the highest weight state is

d(e0, j1, j2; r, l) where l is the spin label of the r-symmetry su (2). the series of uirs

are now,

)

e0  2 + 2j2 + r + 2l  2 + 2j1  r + 2l (or j1  j2, r  r, l  l)

j1, j2  0

(2.14)

which implies

e0  2 + j1 + j2 + 2l, r  j1  j2, 2 + 2j1 + 2l  e0  r  e0  2  2j2  2l

(2.15)

)

e0 = r + 2l  2 + 2j  r + 2l

(j2 = 0, j1 = j, or j1 = 0, j2 = j, r  r)

which implies r  1 + j, e0  1 + j + 2l,

)

e0 = 2l,

j1 = j2 = r = 0

(2.16)

(2.17)

the new phenomenon in n = 2 is that supersingletons appear in two dierent series,

) and ). this is related to the fact that the ) series does not reduce to the identity

representation only, as for n = 1, but contains both massless bulk (l = 1) and massless

boundary (supersingletons) (l = 1/2) representations. let us discuss in detail the cases of

massless bulk and massless boundary representations.

supersingletons in ) correspond to the shortening condition

e0 = r = 1 + j,

l = 0

(2.18)

this is the highest weight state d(1 + j, j, 0; 1 + j, 0). the highest spin in these multiplets

is j + 1. for j = 0 we get the yang-mills multiplet.

the l = 1/2 supersingleton in ) is the hypermultiplet (d(1, 0, 0; 0, 1/2)).

since supermassless bulk representations are dened as the product of two supersingle-

tons we may obtain bulk massless representations by multiplying either two supersingletons

(in a chiral and anti-chiral manner) in ) or by a supersingleton in ) and the l = 1/2

supersingleton in ), or two l = 1/2 supersingletons in ).

6

the spin 2 massless bulk states are obtained by chiral anti-chiral multiplication of

the j = 0 chiral supersingleton in ), giving the shortened representations in ) with

j1 = j2 = r = l = 0. this is the massless graviton multiplet: d(2, 0, 0; 0, 0).

the massless spin 1 multiplet is obtained by multiplying two hypermultiplets and

corresponds to the l = 1 uir of case ), giving d(2, 0, 0; 0, 1).

finally, the massless spin 3/2 multiplet is obtained by multiplying the j = 0 super-

singleton in ) with the hypermultiplet, giving a bulk massless multiplet corresponding

to the shortening r = 1, j = 0, l = 1/2 in ), i.e. d(2, 0, 0; 1, 1/2). the superconformal

realization of these superelds as current multiplets was given in [39,40,41].

obviously these examples can be extended by replacing the chiral vector multiplet by

an arbitrary spin j supersingleton. also one can get, as for n = 1, chiral bulk massless

multiplets by chiral multiplication of two spin j supersingletons as in (2.13).

in the ads5/cft4 correspondence the relevant supersingletons are the chiral vector

multiplets (in ) for j = 0) and the hypermultiplets (in ) for l = 1/2). multiplet

shortening in the ads/cft correspondence will be further discussed in section iv. here

we note that the series ) contains short multiplets with e0 = 2l for each value of l. these

states can be explicitly constructed by multiplying 2l hypermultiplet singletons and their

dimension is not renormalized and coincide with the canonical one. on the other hand,

short multiplets in ), constructed using also chiral vector singletons, may have anomalous

dimension since, due to (2.16), e0 is related to the arbitrarily valued u (1) charge r by

e0 = r + 2l.

3. uirs of p su (2, 2|4) and p u (2, 2|4) and shortening conditions.

the n = 4 superalgebra is of great interest because it corresponds to n = 4 super-

conformal yang-mills theory. in the dual description, it lives at the boundary of ads5

[5,7,8]. the supergravity theory emerges as the low energy limit of type iib string theory

compactied on ads5x5, where x5 is a manifold preserving n = 8 such as s5 or rp5

[11,42].

the uirs classes of the previous section enter in this case as follows.

let us consider a highest weight representation d(e0, j1, j2; r, p, k, q), where r is the

central charge eigenvalue and (p, k, q) are the su (4) dynkin labels. then the three unitary

7

series show up as follow [18]:

a)

e0  2 + 2j2 + r +

(p + 2k + 3q)  2 + 2j1  r +

1
2

(3p + 2k + q)

(or j1  j2, r  r, (p, k, q)  (q, k, p))

which implies

e0  2 + j1 + j2 + p + k + q,

r

(3.3)

and maximal shortening when

e0 = 2 + j1 + j2 + p + k + q,

r =

1
2

(p  q) + j1  j2

(3.4)

generic massless bulk multiplets correspond to p = k = q = 0. they correspond to table

12 in [16].

when we have a strict inequality in (3.1), we obtain generic massive multiplets with

highest spin (j1 + 2, j2 + 2) in the (p, k, q) representation of su (4). note that all these

long multiplets (with jm ax  4) must necessarily be associated to stringy states, since in

supergravity all the states have j  2.

b)

e0 = r +

1

2

(3p + 2k + q)

(for j2 = 0,j1 = j or j1  j2, r  r, (p, k, q)  (q, k, p))

which implies

e0  1 + j + p + k + q

r  1 + j +

1
2

(p  q)

the maximal shortening occurs when

e0 = 1 + j + p + k + q

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

and the chiral supersingletons occur for p = k = q = 0. they correspond to table 6 of [16].

when a strict inequality occurs in (3.6) and p = k = q = 0, we have uirs described by

8

n = 4 chiral (left-handed) superelds with highest spin (j + 2, 0) in su (4) singlets with

 = r  4.

c)

e0 = p+k+q,

r =

1
2

(pq),

j1 = j2 = 0 (3.8)

which gives supersingleton representations for p (or q) = 1, k = 0 or p = q = 0, k =

1. the self-conjugate (yang-mills) supersingleton with spin 1 corresponds to the

d(1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 1, 0) highest weight and the spin 3/2 supersingleton to d(1, 0, 0; 1/2, 1, 0, 0).

they correspond to table 1 and 2 of [17].

the uirs of the p su (2, 2|4) superalgebra are obtained by setting r = 0 in the

previous shortening conditions. correspondingly, we also abolish the entry corresponding

to r in the symbol d denoting highest weight states. we get the three classes of uirs,

a)

e0  2 + j1 + j2 + p + k + q,

j2  j1

k, j, 0; p, k, p + 2 + 2j). no supersingletons appear in this series.

c )

e0 = 2p + k,

p = q,

j1 = j2 = 0 (3.13)

the highest weight states are d(2p + k, 0, 0; p, k, p). the p = 0, k  2 uirs correspond

to the kk states of type iib on ads5  s5, the k = 2 case being associated with the bulk

graviton multiplet. the p = 0, k = 1 uir corresponds to the only supersingleton of the

p su (2, 2|4) algebra [19,16]. the innite sequence of uirs with p = 0, multiplets with

jm ax = 2, have been obtained in [26] with the oscillator construction. they correspond

9

to the harmonic [43] holomorphic superelds of [44]. the case p 6= 0 may be relevant for

multiparticles supergravity states, as will be discussed in the next section.

to summarize the structure of uirs of su (2, 2|n ) algebras: generic massive su-

permultiplets, occurring when a strict inequality in (2.4)),(2.14)),(3.1)) holds, have mul-
tiplicity 24n , generic multiplets when the inequality in (2.6)),(2.16)),(3.5)) occurs have
multiplicity 22n (the same is true for the series c), ), c)). at the threshold of the uni-

tarity bounds, these multiplicities shrink. for example, massless bulk multiplets have
multiplicity 22n , while massless boundary multiplets (supersingletons) 2n .

4. applications to the ads/cft correspondence

the previous analysis of shortening conditions nds applications in the ads/cft

correspondence, where many shortened multiplets are realized.

for n = 1 theories, the prototype is type iib on ads5  t 1,1, where all type of

shortening a), b) and c) have been shown to occur for j1, j2  1/2 [31,22,32].

for n = 2 theories also all types of shortening occur. shortening ) includes, for

instance, n = 2 tensor multiplet kk recurrences, while shortening ) corresponds to

n = 2 vector multiplet kk recurrences [45,30].

the n = 4 case includes, for the p su (2, 2|4) algebra, all the kk states of type iib
on ads5  s 5 [11,26,8,25,24]. it also contain other states corresponding to multiparticle

supergravity states, which can in principle be analyzed [27]; they correspond to multitrace

conformal operators in the yang-mills theory [46,47,28,29].

shortening in a) typically occurs in free-eld theory but not in the interacting n = 4

theory. for instance, the d(e0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0) highest weight corresponds to the konishi

multiplet, which undergoes a shortening in a free theory (e0 = 2) while is long in the

interacting yang-mills theory since e0 > 2 [48,40,49,9]. in the ads/cft correspondence,

it is indeed the simplest example of operator corresponding to a stringy state. another

example of operator which is short only in free theory is the highest weight d(3, 0, 0; 0, 0, 2)

in b), which contains the superpotential of the n = 4 theory when it is written in n = 1

notations. it is not a primary conformal supereld in the interacting yang-mills theory

since it can be obtained by total antisymmetrization of the product of three self-conjugate

supersingletons [9,50].

the sequence c) has an interesting application to multitrace operators, since it pre-

dicts that primary operators with highest-weight d(2p+k, 0, 0; p, k, p) are not renormalized.

10

in a single trace operator, representations with p 6= 0 are not primary since they involve

at least a partial antisymmetrization of the yang-mills supersingletons, which makes it a

descendent via equations of motion [8,25,24]. the same argument does not apply to mul-

titrace operators. consider the simplest case. out of two single-trace primary operators

in the 20r (p = 0, k = 2) we can construct by multiplication several multitrace operators.

they are in the symmetric product (20r  20r)s = 105 + 84 + 20r + 1. the previous

discussion implies that the 105 and 84 ((0, 4, 0) and (2, 0, 2)) can t into a shortening

condition and are not renormalized, so that anomalous dimensions can only show up for

the 20r and singlet pieces. this result has been recently conrmed in [27,28,29] for the

(0, 4, 0) piece and in [28] for the 84 piece, by an explicit perturbative computation.

it is interesting to speculate at this point whether uirs of the p u (2, 2|4) algebra with

r 6= 0 can occur. it is obvious that, since the yang-mills theory is built in terms of the

self-conjugate multiplet with r = 0, any local operator constructed out of such multiplet

will have r = 0 and will be in some representation of p su (2, 2|4). however, as speculated

in [17], if some ads5 states are dual to dyonic non-perturbative states of the yang-mills

theory, then necessarily a new sector with r 6= 0 will appear at the non-perturbative level.

natural candidates are the 1/4 bps dyonic states of the yang-mills theory [51], which

would correspond to the second exceptional supersingleton representation in c) (with

jm ax = 3/2). to strengthen this interpretation, it would be interesting to understand

how the central u (1) acts on spacetime type iib elds. we could conjecture that non-

perturbative states with r 6= 0 are obtained by considering type iib (p, q) ve-branes and

strings. the mentioned 1/4 bps states of the yang-mills theory certainly fall into this

category, since they are obtained as junctions of (p, q) strings [51]. the central charge of

the u (2, 2|4) algebra is an su (4) singlet and may temptatively be interpreted as coming

from a wrapped ve-brane, in some generalization of the construction in [42]. the question

whether such states are actually bps saturated in ads5 is somewhat unclear.
