the o-shell structure of the string sigma model is investigated.

in the open bosonic string,
nonperturbative eects are shown to depend crucially on the regularization scheme. a scheme
retaining the notion of string width reproduces the structure of wittens string eld theory and the
associated unconventional gauge transformations.

numerous approaches to string theory exist. many in-
volve the on-shell structure of strings, thereby providing
information about topics such as scattering amplitudes.
however, the o-shell structure of string theory is also
of interest. in the case of particle physics, the transition
between on-shell and o-shell physics is implemented by
the step from relativistic quantum mechanics to parti-
cle quantum eld theory, and this ultimately provides
insights about topics such as the structure of the vac-
uum. understanding o-shell string physics could simi-
larly lead to substantial physical insights.

direct construction of a eld theory for strings is pos-
sible in certain cases [1] and provides some evidence for
nontrivial vacuum structure [2], but this program has
proven dicult to implement for general strings. a more
practical approach to o-shell string structure is to ob-
tain the equations of motion for the particle elds as-
sociated with the string modes and subsequently to re-
construct the corresponding action. in the string sigma
model, for example, background particle elds can be
introduced and their equations of motion extracted by
imposing world-sheet conformal invariance [3].
if the
elds gk are viewed as couplings on the world sheet,
this procedure amounts to imposing the vanishing of the
renormalization-group beta functionals j. the j are
expected to originate from variation of a background-
eld action i,

j = gjki/gk,

(1)

for a suitable metric gjk [4]. this suggests that i could
be an appropriate tree-level action in a eld-theory for-
mulation for strings.

although the literature on the string renormalization
group and the beta functionals is extensive (see, for ex-
ample, refs. [517]), results for the action i have suered
from a degree of arbitrariness [18] because the calcula-
tions are typically performed in a xed gauge and subse-
quently converted to covariant form using the equations
of motion to redene the elds. this process introduces
free parameters and leads to nonlocal or even singular
actions.
it also has the disadvantage that information
about the static potential in i and hence about nontriv-
ial string vacua is lost, as nonderivative terms can be
arbitrarily replaced by derivatives.

in this work, we investigate a background-eld action
without xing the gauge. in a general weak-eld expan-
sion, the beta functionals j of the elds gj at scale t can
be written j  dgj(t)/dt = jgj + j
klgkgl + . . . (no sum
on j). this equation has the solution [7]

gj(t) = ej tgj(0) + (e(k+l)t  ej t)

j
klgk(0)gl(0)
k + l  j

. (2)

the idea here is to establish explicitly the behavior of
renormalized elds as a function of the cuto parameter
a in a two-dimensional eld theory, and then by com-
parison with eq. (2) to deduce the corresponding beta
functionals and hence the eld-theory action.

for deniteness, we consider open bosonic strings. it
suces for our purposes to investigate couplings involv-
ing a background of tachyons t and massless vector elds
a, so without loss of generality we can take as the start-
ing point the standard action

where a can be regarded as the cuto in the two-
dimensional eld theory. given a classical background
x 
0 (x, y) satisfying the equations of motion, we write
x  as x  = x 
0 +  and perform a weak-eld ex-
pansion in the eective action. the boundary prop-
agator relevant for calculation of expectation values is
h(x1)(x2)i = 2 ln|x|, where x  x1  x2.
we perform a calculation of the linear and quadratic
terms in the eective action using two distinct types of
regulator. one involves direct regularization of the corre-
lator. the second involves a regularization of the eective
action that cannot be derived from a regularized corre-
lator. both calculations are nonperturbative in .
in
what follows, we rst present the calculations and then
discuss the results.

to begin, consider a one-parameter family of correlator

regularizations dened by

h(x1) (x2)i = 

2


 ln(|x| + a)

,

where  is a positive parameter. in the    limit,
this corresponds to a step-function cuto:
h(x1) (x2)i = 2(cid:26) ln|x|,

|x| > a;
|x| < a.

ln a,

(5)

the calculation is presented explicitly here only in this
limit. for simplicity in what follows, we set  = 1.

expanding the eective action to second order in
the string coupling g suces to extract the linear and
quadratic terms. this corresponds to coupling up to two
background elds to the string world sheet. the eec-
tive action involves divergent integrals over the coupling
points x1 and x2. following the standard procedure, we
taylor-expand x2-dependent factors around x1, regular-
ize using eq. (5), and perform the x2 integral. comparing
coecients of dx/dx then allows the extraction of the
renormalized elds as a function of a:

turbative nature of the calculation requires elds at all

simplicity throughout this work we truncate the full ex-
pressions to terms containing only t and a.

kl in eq. (2).

as expected, the form of eq. (6) matches that of the
general solution (2). with a  et we reproduce the
factors ej t, but the terms e(k+l)t are absent. this is
because the infrared cuto has been removed in the cal-
culation, while the only physically relevant scale would
be the ratio between ultraviolet and infrared cutos [7].
explicitly reintroducing an infrared cuto reinstates the
missing terms. we can thus identify t (k) = 1  k2 and
a
= k2. this permits the identication of the coe-
cients j
a total derivative k(k) with arbitrary  can be
added to the second of eqs. (6) because it vanishes in
the integral over the boundary. this freedom provides
some exibility in the choice of j and j
kl. decompos-
k , with a
ing a = a

k  k(k  a)/k2, reveals that
a
the values of a

k and 
kl remain unprescribed. an at-
tractive choice at the linear level is (k) = k  a(k).
as shown below, this decouples the longitudinal part of
a(k) in the beta functionals, makes a
k vanish, and
leads to a gauge-invariant equation of motion for the sta-
tionary points of the renormalization-group ow. at the
nonlinear level, there is also always a unique way (vary-
ing with the regularization scheme) to maintain gauge
invariance by correctly choosing (k).

careful comparison of eqs. (6) with eq. (2), keeping
a
 and a
k separate and replacing the discrete sums over
j and k in eq. (2) by integrals over k1 and k2, permits
the extraction of the desired beta functionals

as explained above, the latter beta functional is chosen
to vanish at order g0 but is otherwise arbitrary.

these beta functionals cannot be obtained directly
from an action. however, it suces to obtain a rela-
tion of the form (1) for some functionals gjk. this can
be achieved to order g with

this lagrangian is invariant under the usual gauge trans-
formations t (k) = 0, a(k) = .

next, we repeat the above calculation in an alterna-
tive regularization scheme. the expectation values for
coincident points are taken to be the same as before, so
the critical exponents t (k) and a(k) and the analy-
sis of the linear terms in the beta functionals remains
unchanged. however, for noncoincident points x1, x2 in
the quadratic terms we now stipulate the brick-wall con-
dition |x| > a. this regularizes the integrals over x1,
x2 by excluding intervals with two points closer than a.
the correlators are otherwise unchanged [19].

the renormalized elds as functions of a now become

the two calculations above conrm that to this order
the renormalization-group ow is a gradient ow [20],
albeit involving two dierent lagrangians (9) and (12).
both lagrangians are supercially similar, having cubic
couplings and identical kinetic terms.

it is of particular interest to note that both lagrangians
contain a static t 3 coupling. this arises in l despite
the linearity of ,t (k) in the static t modes, as a con-
sequence of the existence of the nontrivial gjk required
for the existence of the action [21]. there are two general
types of argument in the literature in favor of a purely
quadratic tachyon potential [22]. the rst draws conclu-
sions from the beta functional, which disregards the need
for nontrivial gjk. the second derives a trivial scaling
behavior for the tachyon eld using perturbative string
theory, which is insensitive to nonperturbative eects.

it is also of interest that the gauge properties of the two
lagrangians (9) and (12) are qualitatively dierent. each
term in l is invariant under the usual particle gauge
transformations. however, the gauge invariance of l is
modied at order g relative to the usual case [23], and
individual terms are not independently gauge invariant.
indeed, the static t aa coupling would be incompat-
ible with the usual particle gauge symmetry. note that
the issue of the structure of the lagrangian is potentially
of more than academic interest. for example, the occur-
rence of static interaction terms such as t aa between
tensors and scalars may trigger spontaneous symmetry
breaking with expectation values not merely for scalars
but also for lorentz tensors [2]. if this occurs under fa-
vorable circumstances in a realistic string theory, it might
produce an observable spontaneous breakdown of lorentz
and cpt invariance [24].

the origin of the dierence in the two calculations can
be traced to the integration of correlators of the form
heik1(x1)eik2(x2) . . .i, where the ellipsis refers to factors
of the form xj (xj ) indicating coupling to a(kj). the

scalar product of this expression with k
j determines the
longitudinal coupling to a
k (kj) and arises by dieren-
tiation with respect to xj , i.e., it is a total derivative.
therefore, in the rst regularization scheme in which
an integration is performed over all real values of xj,
the longitudinal coupling necessarily vanishes (assuming
no contribution from boundary terms). this argument
holds for any scheme based on regularizing the correla-
tor in which x2 can take arbitrary values relative to x1,
including the scheme of eq. (4) for generic .
in con-
trast, the brick-wall scheme avoids this requirement be-
cause the regularization excludes an interval of width a
from the integration. see fig. 1. note that the incom-
patibility of this scheme with conventional gauge trans-
formations means that care is required with standard
manipulations. for example, adding a boundary term

r dxd/dx  r dxdx /dx to the action (3) would

correspond to a conventional gauge transformation and
would therefore change the physics in this scheme.

although one might be tempted to dismiss the brick-
wall regularization scheme because it cannot be derived
from a fundamental correlator dened at all distances on
the world sheet, this feature may in fact make the scheme
more relevant to string theory. introducing a cuto dis-
tance a in the integral is equivalent to introducing a cut-
o for world-sheet momenta of the order of 1/a. the
uncertainty principle then implies that distances shorter
than a cannot be distinguished. from the perspective of
external open strings coupling to the world-sheet bound-
ary, it is more natural to allow for a width of order a
rather than zero. this corresponds to excluding any dis-
tance smaller than a in calculating correlators between
two strings coupling at dierent external points, and in-
deed coincident correlators corresponding to the same ex-
ternal string have a natural separation of order a. from
this perspective, the rst regularization scheme treats the
background couplings as if they arose from point-particle
interactions, which may be unjustied as it omits a phys-
ical aspect of the background-string interactions.

the need in the rst regularization scheme for a non-
trivial metric gjk to ensure the existence of the action
and the corresponding lagrangian l is a disadvantage.
the metric gjk must be invertible to avoid introducing
physics beyond that contained in the beta functionals.
although this invertibility may hold for suciently small
eld values, gjk can become singular under certain cir-

3

cumstances. for example, noninvertibility could occur in
eqs. (8) for eld values of order 1/g, suggesting that l
is inappropriate to describe the corresponding physics.
nontrivial vacua are associated with eld values of order
1/g, so investigating the corresponding physics with l
would appear to require considerable caution.
an interesting argument in favor of the brick-wall
scheme arises by comparing the two results obtained
above with string eld theory [1]. the form of the la-
grangian lsft for this theory comparable to l and l
can be extracted from ref. [25]. we nd

lsft = 1

2 t (2 + 1)t  1
4 f f  + 1
+g t ( a a + a a )

,

3! g t 3 + 1

2 g t a a
(14)

where as before g is the on-shell tree-level three-tachyon
coupling. in this expression, the elds fn with mass n are
smeared over the distance  in the interaction terms:
fn  fn  exp[ ln(33/4)( n)]f . the full string
eld theory is gauge invariant [1], and the leading-order
gauge transformations of lsft exhibit modications [25]
corresponding to those in eq. (13). by construction, l,
l, lsft all coincide on-shell in the transverse gauge and
hence produce the same on-shell amplitudes.
it is striking that the lagrangians l and lsft agree
term-by-term, excluding the smearing factors in lsft.
this suggests that within the sigma model the use of the
brick-wall regularization scheme may be appropriate. we
anticipate that the missing smearing factors could also
emerge in the sigma model approach if the positions of
the attached strings (e.g., x1 and x2 in fig. 1(b)) are
taken as having an intrinsic uncertainty of width a. how-
ever, this issue lies beyond our present scope.

a natural question is whether appropriate redenitions
of t (k) and a(k) might convert lagrangians of the form
l and lsft into ones of the form l, or perhaps might
be used to eliminate entirely the static t 3 and t aa
terms and similar ones appearing at higher order. in l,
for example, this can indeed be done for small eld val-
ues at order g. although it is conceivable that for small
enough eld values a similar redenition could be imple-
mented locally at higher order in g, the procedure fails
globally whenever nontrivial extrema of the static poten-
tial exist because the necessary eld redenitions become
singular. if indeed the presence of cubic (or higher-order)
interactions creates extrema of the static potential away
from zero, then the inappropriate use of eld redeni-
tions in this context would amount to preordaining the
irrelevance of nontrivial string vacua.
