abstract

using the new regularization and renormalization scheme recently proposed

by yang and used by ni et al , we analyse the sine-gordon and sinh-gordon

models within the framework of gaussian eective potential in d + 1 di-

mensions. our analysis suers no divergence and so does not suer from

the manipulational obscurities in the conventional analysis of divergent in-

tegrals. our main conclusions agree exactly with those of ingermanson for

d = 1, 2 but disagree for d = 3: the d = 3 sinh(sine)-gordon model is

non-trivial. furthermore, our analysis shows that for d = 1, 2, the running

coupling constant (rcc)has poles for sine-gordon model(2 < 0) and the

sinh-gordon model (2 > 0) has a possible critical point 2

c while for d = 3,

the rcc has poles for both 2 > 0 and 2 < 0.

introduction

the gaussian eective potential (gep) has proven to be a powerful non-perturbative approac

in quantum eld theories (qft). using the gep approach, stevenson etc. found two distinct, non-

trivial versions of the 3+1 dimensional 4 theory: the precarious 4 theory and the autonomous

4 theory[1], and thus provided a new view point about the triviality of 4 model as a physical

theory. also by gep, ingermanson examined the generalized sinh-gordon and sine-gordon model

in d + 1 dimensions[2]. the lagrangian for the model takes in general the form

l =

1
2

()2 

m2
2 [ch()  1]

(1)

where m and  are the mass and coupling constant respectively at tree level. if 2 > 0,the classical

potential is a cosh curve with a single minimum at the origin; if 2 < 0, it is actually a sine-

gordon model with an innite number of degenerate minimum of the potential. the limiting case
2  0 is usually understood to be a free theory of masss m. when d = 1, the sine-gordon model
is equivalent to a group of other models[3], namely, the massive thirring model[4], the coulom

gas[5], the continuum limit of the xyz spin= 1
2 model[6] and the massive o(2) non-linear -model[5
it is convenient to dene 2 = 2 for discussing the sine-gordon model.
it has been shown
that the d = 1 sine-gordon model is superrenormalizable for 0  2  4; renormalizable for
4  2  8,and nonrenormalizable for 2 > 8[7], the last property was rst discovered b
coleman[4]. based on gep, ingermanson concluded that for d  3, the model (1) can exist only as
a free theory while for d < 3, the vacuum is unstable over a certain range of the coupling constan

in ingermansons analysis, the integrals

i d

n (2) = z ddp

(2)d

p2 + 2
(p2 + 2)n

(2)

may be divergent or nite. the divergent ones were dealt with without using any cuto procedure

or regularization procedure and were just taken to be as though nite most of the time, and the
whole analysis seems to be regularization scheme independent. yet for d  3, the fact that i d
2 (
is divergent was used to lead to the conclusion that the interacting theory is inconsistent for d 
hence, the rule that taking i d

n as nite was violated here and there exists such a kind of manipula-

tional obscurity.

to eliminate this obscurity, we intend to re-analyse the model (1) by the new regularization and

renormalization (r-r) scheme, which was proposed by yang[8] and used by ni et al recently[9]-[12

eective potential, sine-gordon

though the derivative regularization trick has been evolving in the literatures for many years [13

[18]. the spirit is like this: when encountering a supercially divergent feynmann diagram integral

(fdi), we rst dierentiate it with respect to some parameter such as a mass parameter enough times

until it becomes convergent and the integration can be done. then we reintegrate it with respect

to the same parameter the same times. the result is to be taken as the denition of the original

fdi. then instead of divergence, some arbitrary constants appear in fdi. the appearence of these

arbitrary constants indicates some lack of theoretical knowledge about the model at qft level under

consideration. the determination of them is beyond the ability of the qft, instead, they should b

xed by experiment via some suitable renormalization procedure. this new r-r scheme has turned

out to be successful in that the whole analysis is quite clearcut and it can give a prediction of higgs

mass, mh = 138 gev in the standard model[11]. also it provides an elegant calculation in qed,

e.g. lamb shift [12] . in this paper our main conclusions agree exactly with those of ingermanson

for d = 1, 2. but for d = 3 there is an important discrepancy : the d = 3 sinh(sine)-gordon

model may be non-trivial. furthermore, our analysis shows that for d = 1, 2, the running coupling

constant (rcc)has poles for 2 < 0 and the sinh-gordon model has a possible critical point 2

c while
for d = 3, the rcc has poles for both 2 > 0 and 2 < 0. in section 2, we give a general analysis

of the model (1) in the schrodinger representation and present some known results. in section 3, w

analyse the model for d = 1, 2, 3 respectively by the new r-r scheme. the last section is devoted

to discussions.

(8)

in particular, we often choose g() = 0. in schrodinger representation, the state is described b

wave functional [] which satises the schrodinger equation

h[] = e[]

(9)

the rst step in gaussian variational method is to make an ansatz for the schrodinger wave functional

for the vacuum

the p, , f are variational parameters. the energy of the variational state eq.(10) is

we are interested in nding the eective potential, so we consider the energy of the state with constan

(18)

according to ritz variational principle[19], any stationary state (10) is an eigenstate of the discrete

spectrum of h, and the corresponding eigenvalue is the stationary value of the function (17). thus
we consider the stationary points (2, ) for e which are solutions of the equations

(as one is interested in the eective potential, one may consider the stationary point 2 and leav

where the fuctional relation of 2 to  is the same as (22) of 2 to . like the usual eective potential

vef f obtained by loop expansions[20], vg has also the physical interpretation: it is the minimum of

the expectation value of the energy density for all states constrained by the condition that the eld

 has expectation value . using (22), vg can be written as

(in general, the stationary

points of an arbitrary function f (x, y) agree with those of f (x(y), y), where x as a function of y

determined by f /x = 0, but whether f (x, y) and f (x(y), y) acquire their maximum or minimum

simultaneously just depends.)

3 the new r-r analysis

3.1 the d = 1 case

following the spirit of the new regularization, we have

i2 =

1
2

i1 = 

1
2

ln

2
2
s

i0 = c 

2
4

(ln

2
s  1)
2

(47)

eective potential, sine-gordon

where c, 2

s are two arbitrary constants. it can be easily seen that only 2

s is non-trivial and is to b

determined by some renormalization scheme. thus we only need the mass renormalization condition.

we choose such a scheme that the 0-renormalized mass is just the mass given at the tree level, i.e.

m2

r = m2

(48)

so from (22) and (41) we have zm = 1 which xes i1 = 0, thus 2

s = m2. consequently, the

renormalized coupling constant 2

r is

2
r =

1  1
1 + 1

4 2
8 2 2

(49)

i.e. the coupling constant endures a nite renormalization which can provide us with some importan

information about the model after quantization. since it is usually expected that quantum corrections

are small so 2

r and 2 should be of the same sign, we should have that

which implies that

1  1
1 + 1

4 2
8 2 > 0

 8 < 2 < 4

(50)

(51)

on the other hand, the optimal  for e(2, ) incidentally coincides with the minimum 0 for vg
from (28) we have

2 > 8

(52)

so the two conditions agree well and conrm that there exists a critical value for 2, i.e. for 2
0, 2 < 4,but for 2 = 2 < 0, 2
critical point at which 2

c = 8. it seems that for sinh-gordon model, 2 = 4 is also

r = 0, but whether the higher vertices also become zero, i.e. whether the

model becomes a free one has to be conrmed by further analysis.

consider now the low-lying excited states relative to [2(), ]. the gap equation (22) no

turns out to be

(

2

m2 )1+ 2

8 = ch

(53)

since i1 =  1
m2 , we must have 2()  m2 for 2 > 0 and 2  m2 for 0  2 < 8. that
is the mass parameter at tree level provides a lower bound for the particle mass of low-lying excited

2 ln 2()

states if 2 > 0 while an upper bound if 2 < 0 after the model is quantized.

now let us see the rcc. it has poles whose locations are determined by

1 +

1
8

2 = 0

(54)

eective potential, sine-gordon

1 +

1

2ch2 = 0

ch = 0

so only when 2 = 2 < 0 does the rcc possess poles at

2 = m2(

1622 ) in the sine-gordon model[22]-[23], it seems that the mass scale 2

nothing to do with the soliton masses.

3.2 d=2 case.

now the regularized integrals are

i2 =

1
2

(2)1/2

i1 = 

1
2

(2)1/2 + c1,

i0 = 

1
6

(2)3/2 +

1
2

c12 + c0

(58)

c0 and c1 are two arbitrary constants and only c1 is nontrivial as in the d = 1 case. so we need
only to x the mass renormalization condition. similarly we have i1|0 = 0 and so c1 = 1
2 (m2)1/
hence the renormalized coupling constant is

similar to eq.(50) we should have

so

from (28) we also have

m seems also to be a possible

(63)

eective potential, sine-gordon

we have for 2 > 0,

equation (67). these poles exist only for 2 < 0. thus after quantization we have two mass scales

2 )2 and 2

2
2 and 2

where 2

s, c2 and c3 are arbitrary constants and c3 is trivial . so we need both mass renormalization

therefore from (40) we have

we arrive at an important conclusion that the d = 3 sinh(sine) -gordon model is non-trivial. this

is an important descrepancy between our analysis and that of ingermanson.

the bounds for the particle mass of the low-lying excited states can also be obtained. from the

. consider the solution of this equation by graphical means. first when 2 > 0, for  = 0, the curv

of the l.h.s. will intersect that of the r.h.s. at two points: x1 = 1 and a larger x2. as  increases,

the rst root increases and the second one decreases. at some critical cri, the two will meet. as
 increases further, there will be no root for 0 < x < . for  < cri , in order to guarantee the
local minimun of of e, the root must satisfy eq.(28), i.e.  ln x > 1 and i2 6= 0. therefore, for  =
x = 1 is not denitely the local minimum. in general we have that when 2()  m2 .for 2 <
there is only one root of the gap equation. in this case, if  = 2n, the root x = 1 is not either the
local minimum. since ln cos  0, we have x  1. certainly, eq(28) must be also satised at the
root if it is a local minimum of e.

the analysis of rcc is a little more dicult. eq(44) gives a pole 2

1 = 0 when 2 < 0. eq(45)

now reads

since for 2 > 0, 2  m2, there is only one solution to it. for 0 < 2 < 322e
m2 , 2  m2, there will
exist two solutions. eq(46) can also give one pole for the 2 > 0 and two poles for 2 to take values

over a certain range.

4 summary and discussion

we have extracted some physical information of sinh(sine)-gordon model by using the new r-r

sheme. we arrive at an important conclusion which is substantially dierent from ingermansons

that the d = 3 sinh(sine) -gordon model is non-trivial so long as the regularization constant 

eective potential, sine-gordon

13

is chosen to be m2. this should not be surprising because for d = 3, the coulomb gas model can

also be transformed to be a sine-gordon model and there should exist a nontrivial quamtum theory

for the former. our conclusions agree exactly with those of ingermanson for d = 1, 2 but disagree

for d = 3. furthermore, our analysis shows that for d = 1, 2, the rcc has poles for 2 < 0 and

the sinh-gordon model has a critical point 2

c while for d = 3, the rcc has poles for both 2 >
and 2 < 0. the existence of the poles of the rcc provides some new mass scales as in the 

model[11]. unfortunately we can not still obtain another critical point 2

c = 4 which is almost as

important as 2

c = 8 in the d = 1 sine-gordon model[7]. this is perhaps an intrinsic disability of

the gep method.

the poles in rcc reect the intrinsic properties of the model. they are neither the mass of

solitons nor quite the same as the so-called landau pole l like that in qed discussed in previous

literatures. in the past, the landau pole l emerges as an singularity or obstruction on the way of
running of cuto   , or some arbitrary mass scale  ( which stems from some regularization
procedure, e.g. the dimensional regularization) approaching to innity. of course, there is some

similarity between landau pole and the largest mass scale in our treatment. for example, in ref.[11

it is found that there are three mass scales characterizing the 4 model, among them, the largest

one, say c, can only be found by non-perturbative method (like gep) and evolves into the largest

energy scale in the standard model of particle physics where the -eld is coupled to gauge elds. a

c, the system undergoes a phase transition in vacuum (from symmetry broken phase to symmetric

one). we guess that similar phase transition would occur also in the models considered in this paper.

as in the present r-r scheme, there is no explicit divergence (which is substituted by some

constants c, s), no counterterm, no bare parameter and no arbitrary running mass scale (all i in

our treatment are xed and all running parametres are physical ones) as well. there is no obtruction
in the running of cuto    and no bare parametre, say 0 either, so there is no contradiction
enforcing 0  0. hence we claim that there is no triviality in d = 3 sinh(sine)-gordon model as
that in 4 model[11]. a useful model should be non-trivial. on the other hand, very probably

has some singularities e.g. some poles of rcc, showing the boundary of its applicability. to kno

the physics at the singularitis is beyond the ability of the qft under consideration.

as discussed in ref.[9], the qft is not well-dened by the lagrangian solely. in gep scheme,

eective potential, sine-gordon

model is dened by the eective hamiltonian

(75)

with vg containing some arbitrary constants (c, i). the constant are the necessary compliments to
the originall before the model can be well-dened. they are nothing but the values of mass scales
and coupling constants. in some sense, the renormalization in qft is just like to reconrm the plane

ticket before ones departure from the airport. we must keep the same symbol of parametres, sa

m, through out the whole calculation.

once these constants are xed, the model is well dened and has some prediction power. the

calculation of eq.(74) at tree level already includes the quantum corrections. we can consider an

momentum dependent vertices after the rst two terms besides vg in eq.(74) are taken into accoun

everything is unambiguous and is well-controled. the reason why an original non-renormalizable

model becomes renormalizable in gep scheme could be understood by an example in quantum

mechanics . in the hamiltonian of hydrogen-like atom, if besides h0 = 1

22 p2  ze2

4r , we add a small

perturbation term, h = aebp2 = apk=0 bkp2k, then the energy correction in eigenstate | nlm
remains nite and xed to be e =< nlm | h | nlm > whereas the contribution of individual
term in h, < nlm | p2k | nlm >, (k  3), would diverge ! once again, this example reminds us of
the implication of divergence, which is by no means a very large number. rather, it is essentially

warning, showing that there might some lack of knowledge or some unsuitability in our treatmen

for the moment, we can not claim that what we nd is the only nite solution of the model whic

was believed as non-renormalizable. but we think an outcome from gep manipulation could b

meaningful since the experince in physics often tell us that the nature does not reject the simpler

possibility.

in the case of 2 = 2 < 0, i.e.

in the sine-gordon model, the original v ()  cos has
the discrete translational symmetry:   + 2n
 . at rst sight, the ansatz of the gaussian wav
functional eq.(10) would break this symmetry. first, in general one can not expect that the ground

state has the same symmetry as the hamiltonian [23]. note that, however, what appears in eq.(10)
is the dierence (x  x) not x itself. then the contributions of the uctuations in dieren
conguration of  with n 6= 0 are taken into account conceptually for a xed x in the path integral.
yet, the contributions for n 6= 0 is strongly suppressed. in ref.[24](see also [3]), the soliton linking
neighbouring  sectors in quantized sine-gordon model is considered in the d = 1 case with the

eective potential, sine-gordon

gep as shown here by eqs.(30),(47) and (53)

which still preserves the symmetry. for the d = 2 (or 3) case, through we can not write down an

explicit gep like eq.(75) due to the complicate gap equation (63) (or (72)), we are still able to see

that the gep preserves the periodic symmetry,i.e.

vg() = vg( +

2n



)

(77)

in summary, the gep approach combining with the new r-r method does provide a nice calcu-

lational scheme for non-perturbative qft.
