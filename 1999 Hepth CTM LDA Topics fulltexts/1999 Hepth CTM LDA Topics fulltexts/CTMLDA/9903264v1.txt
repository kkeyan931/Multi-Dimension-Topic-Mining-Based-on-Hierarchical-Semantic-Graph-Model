abstract

the slow motion of a self-gravitating cp 1 lump is investigated in the approximation of geodesic ow on
the moduli space of unit degree static solutions m1. it is found that moduli which are frozen in the absence
of gravity, parametrizing the lumps width and internal orientation, may vary once gravitational eects
are included. if gravitational coupling is suciently strong, the presence of the lump compacties physical
space, and the moduli determining the boundary value of the cp 1 eld thaw also. explicit formulae for
the metric on m1 are found in both the weak and strong coupling regimes. the geodesic problem for
weak coupling is studied in detail, and it is shown that m1 is geodesically incomplete. this leads to the
prediction that self-gravitating lumps are unstable.

introduction

collective coordinate approximations have proved to be an invaluable tool in the study of topological soli-
ton dynamics. they truncate the innite dimensional dynamical system of the full eld theory to a nite
dimensional approximation which (hopefully) captures the important features of soliton motion, but is more
amenable to analytic eort. for eld theories of bogomolnyi type, the truncated system for n-soliton dy-
namics is obtained simply by restricting the eld theoretic lagrangian to the moduli space of degree n static
solutions, mn [1]. a rather beautiful feature in this case is that the reduced dynamics amounts to geodesic
motion on mn (hence this is often called the geodesic approximation). the metric on mn descends from the
kinetic energy functional of the eld theory.

the geodesic approximation has been applied in many contexts (bps monopoles [2], abelian higgs vortices
[3, 4] and discrete sine-gordon kinks [5], for example) with considerable success. one system for which the
approximation encounters problems is the cp 1 model in (2 + 1) dimensions [6, 7]. here, a single static soliton
(conventionally called a lump) has 6 parameters: 2 give its position, 3 its internal orientation and 1 sets its
scale (the static eld equation is conformally invariant). hence m1 is 6 dimensional. the metric on m1 is,
however, ill dened because at each static solution, 4 of the 6 zero modes are not normalizable, essentially due
to the lumps weak (polynomial) spatial localization. the only ones which are normalizable generate spatial
translations. it follows that 4 of the 6 moduli are frozen in this approximation, since any change in them is
impeded by innite inertia [6]. of these 4, the 2 which specify the boundary value of the cp 1 valued eld
should be expected to be frozen. that the other 2, determining the lumps width and its orientation about
the boundary value, are frozen is not in good agreement with numerical simulations [8]. these suggest that
more general motion than simply constant velocity drift is possible.

so the geodesic approximation for the cp 1 model is unfortunately rather singular. the singularity is
removed if physical space r2 is replaced by a compact riemann surface (e.g. s2 or t 2), yielding well dened

and mathematically interesting geodesic problems [9, 10]. however, there is no obvious physical justication
for such an assumption.

in this note we wish to describe a more natural means of removing the singularity: namely including
gravitational self interaction. the moduli space m1 of static self-gravitating lumps is already explicitly known,
due to work of comtet and gibbons [11]. the geometric distortion of physical space introduced by gravity is
just sucient to regulate the divergent integrals encountered in [6] when evaluating g, the metric on m1. one
expects, therefore, that the previously frozen moduli thaw once gravitational eects are taken into account.
by restricting the einstein-hilbert-cp 1 action to elds which are at all times in m1, we shall demonstrate that
this is indeed the case. the degree of thawing depends on the strength of the coupling to gravity: for small
coupling, physical space has innite volume and the boundary value of the cp 1 eld remains frozen, while
above a critical coupling, space has only nite volume (it may be isometrically compactied to a deformed
sphere) and all 4 of the previously frozen moduli thaw. we shall derive explicit expressions for g in both cases,
and investigate one-lump dynamics with weak gravitational coupling in detail.

2 the moduli space

the einstein-hilbert-cp 1 action is

i[w, ] =z d3xp||(cid:20)

s

16g

+ 22 w w

(1 + |w |2)2(cid:21) ,

(1)

where  is the lorentzian metric on spacetime (assumed, for the moment, to be dieomorphic to c  r),
|| = det( ), s is the scalar curvature of , w is an inhomogeneous coordinate on cp 1 (or equivalently
a complex stereographic coordinate on s2), g is newtons constant and  is a coupling constant. one may
obtain static degree 1 (degree here meaning the topolgical degree of the mapping w : c  {}  cp 1)
solutions of the corresponding eld equations by imposing the metric ansatz

 = dt2  2(z, z)dz dz,

(2)

z being a complex coordinate on physical space. the static eld equation for w is conformally invariant,
hence independent of . it follows that all the at space solutions of the non-gravitating model (namely
w = rational map in z or z) survive. in particular, the most general degree 1 solution is

w (z) =

a11z + a12
a21z + a22

=:(cid:18) a11 a12

a21 a22 (cid:19)  z = m  z

(3)

with det m 6= 0. note that the identication of a particular rational map w with a gl(2, c) matrix m is
nonunique, since for any   c\{0}, m and m yield the same w . one should therefore identify the space
of degree 1 rational maps with the projective unimodular group p sl(2, c) = sl(2, c)/z2 [9]. the most
convenient parametrization for our purposes is

w (z) = u (cid:18) 

z  (cid:19) ,

(4)

with u  p su (2) = su (2)/z2 = so(3),   (0, ) and   c.

it remains to substitute w back into the einstein equation for . since changing u merely alters the global
internal orientation of w ,  must be independent of u , which we may set to i without loss of generality. the
result, as found by comtet and gibbons [11] is

(z, z) =

1

(2 + |z  |2) ,

(5)

where  = 8g2. if  < 1
2 , the corresponding spatial metric h = 2 dz dz is asymptotically conical, with
a decit angle  = 4, and the singular tip replaced by a region of smooth distortion centred on z = . if
 = 1
2 <  < 1, the volume of space is
nite (volume= 2/(2  1)). by introducing a new coordinate patch with overlap function w = z/|z|2(1),

2 , space is asymptotically cylindrical, with one closed, rounded end. if 1

one may smoothly extend h to s2, so space should be imagined as a deformed sphere. if  = 1, space is
uniformly spherical, z   being a stereographic coodinate. there is a genuine simgularity at z =  if  > 1,
so this regime will not be considered further.

in summary, by m1 we mean the space of pairs

(cid:18)w : z 7 u (cid:18) 

z  (cid:19) , h : z 7

dz dz

(2 + |z  |2)2(cid:19)

(6)

parametrized by (u, , )  p su (2)(0, )c, all of which are static solutions of the einstein-cp 1 equations.

3 the restricted action

it was proved in [11] that the static solutions in m1 saturate a lower bound on decit angle  analogous to
the bogomolnyi bound in the non-gravitating system ( is an eective, albeit nonlocal, measure of the total
gravitational energy of the system.
in our case it coincides with thornes c-energy [12] since the metric
 = dt2  h has circular symmetry). in the absence of gravity, it is obvious that time dependence can only
increase energy, since kinetic energy is manifestly non-negative. it is not clear that the same statement holds
for  in our case, although this is conjectured in [11]. the geodesic approximation is usually justied by
observing that energy conservation forces the eld to stay close to mn for low soliton speeds [1]. rigorous
analysis backs up this physical intuition [13, 14].
in applying the same approximation in the presence of
gravity, we are being somewhat more speculative. nevertheless, given the conjecture above, and previous
applications of the approximation to gravitating systems [15], the collective coordinate approximation seems
sensible, and worthy of investigation.

to obtain the restricted action i|, we substitute into i a eld and metric whose time dependence is of the

where s = sdtdt  sh = sh has been used. now l3 is (up to a constant factor) the potential energy of
the non-gravitating system, so this is manifestly constant on m1 (in fact l3 = 42). a straightforward

establishes that l1 is also constant (l1 = /4g). hence, both l1 and l3 may be discarded from i|, leaving
a reduced action equivalent to a geodesic problem on m1. denoting the 6 moduli collectively by qa, so that
w = qaw/qa one nds that

it remains to compute the metric coecients gab. recall that m1 is dieomorphic to p su (2)  (0, )  c.
the metric g is invariant under changes of u (global internal rotations), so it suces to evaluate g in the
special case u = i. elsewhere, g will follow from the action of the isometry group. a convenient coordinate
chart on p su (2) may be dened as follows: use the canonical identifcation of su (2) with the unit 3-sphere

note that v = 0  u = i. one then nds that

substituting these expressions into (11), it is immediately apparent that all gab are independent of , which may
thus be set to 0. the integrals are easily computed. if   1
2 neither gv1v1 nor gv2v2 exists, the corresponding
integrals being divergent. it follows that v1 and v2 are frozen, and the metric (at v3 = 0) is

where c() = (22   + 1)/(4  2) and  = 1 + i2. to globalize these formulae (remove the condition
u = i) we may dene a left invariant basis {a : a = 1, 2, 3} on t su (2) by expanding the left invariant one
form u 1du in a basis for the lie algebra su(2). we choose

u 1du =  (cid:18) i

2

(cid:19) ,

{a : a = 1, 2, 3} being the pauli spin matrices. the connexion with the previous basis is simple:

a|v=0 = 2dva|v=0.

(16)

(17)

the formulae (14), (15) are easily re-written using a, and then hold equally true away from v = 0 by p su (2)

if 1
2 <   1. in the case of weak coupling, once the boundary value of w is specied, u must remain in the
stabilizer of this boundary value, a so(2) subgroup of p su (2) = so(3). so the lump may spin, but only
about its own axis. geodesic motion takes place on a single leaf m w ()
of a foliation of m1 by 4-manifolds
parametrized by the boundary value w ()  cp 1. more general rotational dynamics is possible in the
regime of strong coupling. note that c(1) = 1, so in the case of spherical spatial geometry, g is exceptionally
symmetric, as one would expect.

4 geodesics in the case of weak coupling

for the sake of simplicity, we henceforth assume that 0 <  < 1
that the frozen boundary value is w () = 0. then u = exp(i3/2), and

w (z) =

this leaf m 0

(20)

(21)

we remark in passing that (m 0

1 , g) is conformally at.

the two-dimensional submanifold on which  = 0, call it , is isometric to a cone of decit angle 4 (with
its tip,  = 0, missing). this cone is a totally geodesic submanifold since it is the xed point set of the discrete
group of isometries {id,  7 }. it immediately follows that (m 0
1 , g) is geodesically incomplete, a property
found to be universal in the non-gravitating model on compact physical space [16]. generically, geodesics on
 miss the singularity  = 0  they emerge from and return to the asymptotic region     and may be
extended forever in the future and past. in interpreting such a geodesic one must take care to account for the
 dependence of the metric on physical space, h. given a xed pair of points in cp 1 (not coincident), the
proper distance between their preimages under w scales as 12, so for 0 <  < 1
2 it is correct to regard 
as a measure of the lumps width. hence, the generic geodesic on  corresponds to a spinning lump shrinking
to some minimum width, then spreading out indenitely, spinning ever more slowly as it expands. there are
also completely irrotational geodesics which hit  = 0 in nite time, corresponding to the lump collapsing to
zero width  the geodesic approximation predicts that self-gravitating lumps are unstable.
returning to the full four-dimensional geodesic problem, the geodesic equation for  is

p = 4  and j = 2(12) /2 being the constant momenta conjugate to the cyclic variables  and 
respectively. clearly, the lump maintains constant velocity  if and only if  remains constant, and in this
case  remains constant too. hence we may obtain translating-spinning solutions with constant  (shape),
 (velocity) and  (angular velocity) by setting the right hand side of (22) to zero. given an initial velocity
(0) = v  c, the lump translates undistorted with  = 0,

 = , constant, if and only if 0 and  satisfy

(0)2 =

|v|2.

(23)

the narrower the lump, the faster it must spin in order to travel undistorted at a given speed. the generic
motion is rather complicated, with speed, angular velocity and width all oscillating with the same period.

5 concluding remarks

we have derived a collective coordinate approximation for the slow motion of a single self-gravitating cp 1
lump by restricting the einstein-hilbert-cp 1 action to the degree 1 moduli space of comtet and gibbons,
m1. this approximation takes the form of a geodesic problem either on a single leaf of a foliation of m1 by
4-manifolds (weak coupling) or on all m1 (strong coupling). the physical interpretation of this is that when
gravitational coupling is weak, the boundary of space lies at innite proper distance, so the boundary value
of the eld remains frozen. every leaf of the foliation is geodesically incomplete, leading us to predict that
self-gravitating lumps are unstable to collapse.

it would be interesting to investigate the general n-lump case along similar lines. here it will be impossible
to nd closed formulae for g analogous to (18) and (19). however, one should still be able to obtain qualitative
information (on completeness of (mn, g), for example) and identify especially symmetric geodesics. one could

5

also investigate single lump motion at strong coupling, using the more complicated metric (19), although this
regime is presumably far from real cosmological applications (the lump may be regarded as a slice through an
innitely long, straight cosmic string). a rigorous justication for the approximation similar to the work of
stuart [13, 14], seems well beyond reach. numerical tests of the approximation would therefore be useful.
