abstract we investigate the properties of non-linear electromagnetism based
on the born-infeld lagrangian in multi-dimensional theories of kaluza-klein type. we
consider at space-time solutions only, which means that the space-time metric is constant,
and the only supplementary variable is the dilaton eld, a scalar. we show that in the case
of kaluza-klein theory, the born-infeld lagrangian describes an interesting interaction
between the electromagnetic and scalar elds, whose propagation properties are modied
in a non-trivial manner.

1. introduction

it is well known since the article by g. boillat ([1]) that the born-infeld the-
ory of electromagnetism ([2, 3, 4]), although highly non-linear, leads under certain
physical requirements to the propagation without birefringence, which makes this
theory very special indeed. in addition, all types of disturbances and waves propa-
gate without producing shocks in a nite time, implying that this case belongs to
the class of theories called completely exceptional.

the born-infeld lagrangian is dened as the square root of the following deter-
minant (we insist on using the mixed covariant and contravariant indeces, because
only then the corresponding expression can be identied with a matrix, i.e. a linear
operator, to which the concept of the determinant does apply):

l = qdet(

 + f

) ,

(1)

4ff  and s = 1

f f, with f  = 1

where f = a,  a, is the maxwell tensor (partial derivatives in covariant
indeces will be denoted by a comma). this lagrangian can be written also as
l = 1 + 2p  s2 where p = 1
2f
is the dual of f. in terms of the electric and magnetic eld intensities one has
p = 1
2(b2 e2) and s = e b. it has been proved in [1] that the only other possible
completely exceptional theory comes from the singular lagrangian l = p/s.
it is amusing to note that the authors of this remarkable theory have been led by
the considerations of niteness of energy, a natural postulate of recovering maxwells
theory as linear approximation, and the hope to nd soliton-like solutions represent-
ing charged particles like in the non-linear (but non-relativistic) theory proposed by
g. mie ([5]), rather than by an appropriate character of wave propagation [7].

another important property that the born-infeld theory shares with maxwells
theory is its invariance under dual transformations, i.e., so(2) rotations of the elds
f and f  into each other (see e.g. [6]).

originally, the born-infeld lagrangian did not have any direct geometrical mean-
ing. another type of non-linear electrodynamics, with a clear geometrical rationale,
which in the limit of weak eld coincides with the maxwell theory, but which diers
from the born-infeld theory already in the second terms of its taylor expansion,
can be derived from the kaluza-klein theory in ve dimensions, in the absence of
scalar and gravitational elds. it is based on the fact that in ve dimensions the
gauss-bonnet term, rabcd rabcd  4 rab rab + r2 is not a topological invariant
like in the 4-dimensional case, but leads to non-trivial equations of motion of second
order when added to the usual einstein-hilbert lagrangian r. (the gauss-bonnet
lagrangian of the 5-dimensional kaluza-klein theory including the variable scalar
eld has been derived by f. muller-hoissen in [8].) the full lagrangian is [9, 10]:

l = r +  (rabcd rabcd  4 rab rab + r2) ,

with  being a dimensional parameter characterizing the relative weight of non-linear
terms. when expressed in four dimensions in terms of the maxwell tensor f, one

16 (ff )2  2 (fff f ), (,  = 0, 1, 2, 3). in terms
of the invariants p and s this lagrangian is given by l = 2p + 3
2 s2, which with
an appropriate choice of  yields (up to a constant) the square of the born-infeld
lagrangian. this theory will be explored in section 5.

recently, the born-infeld type lagrangians appeared naturally in string theo-
ries; this circumstance explains the revival of interest in the non-linear born-infeld
electromagnetism and theories akin to it. for example, the interaction between the
electromagnetic and scalar elds should be investigated because the dilaton (scalar)
elds appear naturally in all eective string lagrangians. deser et al.
[6] have
 + , ,) and
have found that such theories do not ensure the absence of shock propagation. for
the theory to be completely exceptional the total lagrangian must be a sum of the
born-infeld lagrangian (or maxwells theory, or the singular p/s theory mentioned
above) and a lagrangian depending on the invariant , ,) only, meaning the ab-
sence of any interaction between those elds.

considered a theory based on the lagrangian l = qdet(

 + f

in spite of its very special properties, the born-infeld lagrangian cannot be
considered as the ultimate theory; the massless vector eld it describes is certainly
interacting with other possible excitations of string theories, in particular with the
scalar eld. we believe that one of the best ways of introducing the invariant inter-
actions with the scalar eld is the dimensional reduction technique.

instead of adding certain terms (out of several possible ones) containing the scalar
eld alone or interacting with the electromagnetic eld, like in [6], we shall com-
pute the born-infeld lagrangian directly in d + 1 + 1 dimensions (with d = 1, 2, 3
being the number of space-like dimensions), which after reduction to d + 1 space-
time dimensions will give us a unique expression containing the terms describing the
contributions of the elds and their interactions. we then study the propagation of
dynamical elds in this setting. although the full theory is very highly non-linear
and leads to very complicated characteristic cone equations, it is possible to get
some results in the case when one of the elds is constant (i.e. does not propagate),
but still can inuence the propagation of the other one; partial results can be also
obtained in the weak eld limit.

thus, we shall investigate systematically the combination of the born-infeld and
kaluza-klein theories in lower dimensions, starting from the total dimension 3, i.e.
with one space and one time coordinate, plus one extra kaluza-klein dimension. we
also analyze total dimensions 4 and 5. in general, the determinant of an arbitrary
n  n matrix is a polynomial of n-th order containing all possible products of the
elements of the matrix. however, we shall see that due to the particular structure
, its determinants computed in odd dimensions n = 2k + 1
of the matrix 
yield polynomials of even order 2k only.

2. characteristic surfaces and eld propagation

our aim is to nd out how do propagate the elds f and , i.e. how the
characteristic surfaces (cones) depend on dimension, whether both f and  prop-

3

agate along the same cones, and whether birefringence occurs or not, i.e., are these
cones unique. the systems under consideration are second order partial dierential
equations, linear in the highest derivatives, with coecients which depend only on
the elds themselves. it is known (see e.g.
[11]) that the systems of this type can
be reduced to a set of equations of rst order in the derivatives via introduction
of auxiliary elds. these auxiliary variables are the independent linear combina-
tions of the rst partial derivatives of functions describing the degrees of freedom
of our system. for a scalar eld these will be just all its rst derivatives, 0  ,
i  i (i representing the spatial indeces); for the electromagnetic potential a
the auxiliary variables are the electric eld ei and magnetic eld bi which are the
only independent combinations of rst order derivatives of a.

next we represent the dierential system by means of a matrix whose entries
contain the operators of partial derivation or multiplicative coecients, acting on a
vector-column representing auxiliary elds. if the vector-column u with the elds ,
i, ei and bi contains n elements, then let us denote by a the nxn matrix contain-
ing the partial derivatives and by b the nxn matrix containing the multiplicative
factors. then the eld equations can be written in the form

if the hypersurface dened by the implicit equation

a(u)u + b(u)u = 0 .

 (x) = 0 .

(3)

(4)

is a surface of discontinuity, then the rst derivatives of elds are discontinuous
across this surface, whereas the elds themselves are continuous. so, when applied
to the discontinuities across the hypersurface (4), the equation (3) reduces to

(a ) 1u = 0 ,

(5)

where   , and 1u denotes the discontinuity of the rst derivative across
, 1u  u/|+  u/|
. by denition, for a characteristic surface one has
1u 6= 0, therefore, in order for (5) to hold, one must have

det(cid:18)a (cid:19) = 0 ,

(6)

on the surface of discontinuity. the characteristic equation (6) determines the sur-
face whose generic equation is h(x, ) = 0, with h a homogeneous function of
order n in . the theories we study are completely exceptional since they obey
the corresponding condition of [1], namely 0h  h|+  h|
we will use this formalism to study the propagation of waves, characteristic
equations and the possibility of birefringence in various theories. the solutions of
the characteristic equation dene the hypersurfaces along which the propagation
takes place. if the solution is unique, it is said that there is no birefringence.

= 0 (see also [6]).

to make this setup clearer, let us show on a simple example how these ideas

work. we start with the simplest possible case: scalar eld wave equation in a
two-dimensional space-time (t, x):

2

x  = 0 .

(7)

(partial derivatives in lorentz indeces, (0, x, y, z) or (0, 1, 2, 3), will be denoted by
). according to the prescription, we can use as auxiliary elds  and  the rst
derivatives of the scalar eld , 0 =  and x = . then by denition, the rst
derivatives of auxiliary elds are not independent, because we have, as 0 (x ) =
x (0 ), automatically 0  x = 0. on the other hand the dynamical equation
in the matrix notation of (3) these two
(7) can be written as 0  x = 0.
equations can be combined to yield

(cid:18) 0

we then nd

(9)

(10)

and the characteristic equation det(a) = 0 can be written as

where 0  0 and x  x. this last equation denes the characteristic surfaces
(t, x), which in this case are the light-cones in two space-time dimensions.
the same technique can be easily applied to the electromagnetic maxwellian
eld. the matrix becomes quite cumbersome, because we have now six independent
combinations of its rst derivatives (the elds e and b) appearing in the rst-order
equations of the maxwell system. as we know, the characteristic surfaces in four
2 = 0. in the next sections
dimensions are given by , , = 0
we apply these techniques to more complex cases in various dimensions.

3. born-infeld type lagrangians in two dimensions

3.1 the born-infeld theory

starting from the lowest-dimensional case where there is only one space and one

time coordinate one nds that det(

) has the form

det (cid:18) 1

f x

f 0

x

1 (cid:19) = 1  f 0

since f = f, the born-infeld lagrangian can be written as

l = 1 + 2p ,

where

p

(13)

is the only invariant in two dimensions. the euler-lagrange equations are then

l

, = 0,

with l = lp f and l = (l/p ). the equation (14) can be written as

(1 + 2p ) f 

,  (ff ), f  = 0 .

(14)

(15)

in the linear approximation, when the second term of the above equation can be
neglected, we get maxwells equations in two dimensions, i.e. f 
, = 0. the
electric eld is dened by f 0x = xa0  0ax = e, and the magnetic eld does not
exist. the equations for e are:

0e = 0,

xe = 0.

(16)

we see that the only solution is e = const. and there are no waves in born-infeld
(nor in maxwell) theory in a two-dimensional space-time.

3.2 born-infeld theory in kaluza-klein space

with a compactied extra kaluza-klein dimension over the two-dimensional
spacetime, and with constant metric tensor, we get the following expression for
det(

in the above expression one can note the absence of direct coupling between the
scalar and gauge elds. taking the square root of (17) one nds the born-infeld
lagrangian :

(17)

(18)

(19)

l = 1 + 2p  2

where p is given by (13) and

the equations of motion for the vector potential a and the scalar  are, respectively

as before, we dene the electric eld e as the derivative of the potential a

xa0  0ax = e ,

(20)

(21)

(22)

and the two auxiliary elds  and  which are the rst partial derivatives of the
eld ,

the equation (23) implies

0 = ,

x =  .

0  x = 0 .

using (20) and (22) we obtain the equation of motion for the electric eld

(1  2 + 2) 0e +  e 0   e 0 = 0 ,

(23)

(24)

(25)

and an analogous equation with 0 replaced by x. from (21) and (23) we get the
equation of motion for the scalar eld :

(1+e2+2) 0(1+e22) x  (x+0)+ e 0e e xe = 0 . (26)
using the formalism introduced in section 2 we dene the column-vector u with the
elds e,  and . then the equations (24), (25) and (26) can be put in the following
matrix form:

1  2 + 2

therefore the characteristic equation det(a) = 0 is :

the equation (29) can be written in the following covariant form:

(27)

.(28)




(29)

(30)

(v )h(1  ,,)(g + f f 

)

(1  ,,)(,,g  ,,) + 1

2ff ,,i  = 0,

with v  a time-like vector. we see that the characteristic equation (30) separates
into a part that does not propagate the electric eld and a part that propagates

7

the scalar eld. consequently, in a linear theory given by the lagrangian (17)
(without the square root), the electric eld e does not propagate and the scalar
eld propagates along the minkowskian light-cones, g = 0 or in lorentzian
coordinates 2

x = 0, independently of the constant value of the eld e.

to nd the dispersion relation of the theory we put   ,, and use the ansatz
 = aei(tkx). inserting into (29) we nd the relation k = k() characterizing the
propagation of the scalar eld in this theory :

0  2

2 +   



,

k = 

(31)

where   (1  2 + 2)(1  e2  2) + e22,  =  [(1  2 + 2)  e2], and
 = (1  2 + 2)(1  e2 + 2)  e22. to simplify this expression let us consider
a scalar wave propagating in the vacuum, e = 0. then (31) reduces to

k = 

1  2 + 2  

1  2

.

(32)

in the weak eld limit 2  2  1 one has k = h1 + 1
that the propagation velocity of the wave, v | /k |= 1/h1 + 1

2(  )2i. this means
2(  )2i, is less

than one, i.e., less than the speed of light in the linear theory. we also note that
(32) gives no birefringence, as it should be expected for a a scalar eld. there are
only two solutions, one describing an outgoing, the other an ingoing wave.

4. born-infeld type lagrangians in 3 dimensions

4.1 maxwells theory

in three space-time dimensions maxwells theory is non-trivial. the lagrangian
4 ff . introducing the four-potential a we dene the

is l = 2p , where p = 1
maxwell tensor as before,

f = a,  a,.

(33)

in order to simplify the problem we consider here the characteristic equation
for a system depending only on two variables t and y, and in which the only non-
vanishing elds are ax(t, y), ex(t, y) and b(t, y). despite of this simplied choices
for the potentials (some of the components suppressed, and depending only on some
variables) the result is covariant and unique. for this type of simplications see
[11, 12]. from the equation (33), and dening f 0x = ex, f xy = b, we have
e.g.
0ax + ex = 0 and yax + b = 0. the two equations combined yield

the dynamical equation of motion is

0b  yex = 0 .

yb  0ex = 0.

8

(34)

(35)

then, using the formalism of section 2 we obtain

0 y(cid:19) ,
so the characteristic equation det (a) = 0 becomes

a = (cid:18)y 0

0  2
2

y = 0 .

(36)

its invariant generalization taking into account the two space-like dimensions is
obvious :

therefore, also in three space-time dimensions, maxwells theory leads to the prop-
agation along the light-cones.

y = 0 .

(37)

4.2 maxwells theory with non-interacting scalar eld

before we proceed to study born-infeld itself in 3d, and born-infeld with an
extra kaluza-klein dimension let us study a non-interacting maxwell and scalar
eld theory whose lagrangian is given by

l = 2p  2 ,

(38)

4ff  and  = 1

where, as before, p = 1
2, ,. variation with respect to the
electromagnetic potential a yields maxwells equations f 
, = 0 whereas variation
with respect to  yields ,
, = 0. in order to nd the characteristic equations we
again suppose that the system depends only on two variables (t, y), with nonzero
elds given by ax(t, y), ex(t, y), b(t, y) and (t, y). then with the denitons 0
 = 0 and y   = 0, we have the following set of equations,
0ex + yb = 0 ,
0  y = 0 .

0b + yex = 0 ,
0  y = 0 ,

(39)

calculating a one obtains
a =

again, the three-dimensional generalization is obvious:

the characteristic equation det(a) = 0 is (2

(41)

we see that the characteristic is the equation for two non-interacting elds propa-
gating with the velocity of light. the propagation of the two elds splits into two
independent parts because the characteristic matrix (40) is block-diagonal.

where we note the absence of terms of third order in the elds. therefore, taking

the square root, we get the same action as in two dimensions, i.e. l = 1 + 2p
but now f 0x = ex, f 0y = ey and f xy = b as in maxwells theory. the dynamical
equation of motion, given by l
(1 + 2p )f 

, = 0 with l = lp f  yields

(ff ),f  = 0 .

(43)

combining (33) and (43), we get the following set of six equations,

(1 + b2  e2

x)0ey+

exey0ex  eyb0b + exbxex + eybxey = 0 .

(44)

as we did in the previous section, where we have chosen a reduced system, we shall
study the characteristics for a system depending only on two variables (t, y) and
with nonzero elds given by ax(t, y), ex(t, y) and b(t, y). in this case in (44) only
two independent equations remain :

(1  e2

x)yb  (1 + b2)0ex + exb0b + exbyex = 0 .

0b  yex = 0 ,

using the formalism of section 2 we obtain

a = (cid:18)

x)y(cid:19) .
thus the characteristic equation det(a) = 0 can be put in the form,

(1 + b2)0 + exby exb0 + (1 + e2

one can write the characteristic equation (47) in a covariant form,

(g + f  f ) = 0 .

(49)

since   ,, for some function , one can seek the ansatz  = aei(tky) to nd
with the help of (47) the covariant expression

k =

with e = qe2

y . this means that the propagation velocity is less than the
speed of light in the linear theory, and there is no birefringence as it is expected for
a born-infeld theory, [1].

where the coecients as and bs are known functions of e, b,  and . we can
see how, due to the non-linearity, the o-diagonal terms start to appear signaling

one can in principle nd solutions to equation (57) under simplied assumptions,
such as considering one eld a constant while the other is propagating. we will do
this for the four-dimensional case in section 5.4.

5. born-infeld type lagrangians in 4 dimensions

now we consider the following theories in four dimensions: maxwells theory,
kaluza-klein theory with gauss-bonnet term, the usual born-infeld electrodynam-
ics, and the born-infeld theory in kaluza-klein space.

5.1 maxwells theory

the results for maxwells theory are well known. we choose a reduced system in
order to provide a short demonstration. it is enough to consider the characteristic
equations for a system depending only on two variables (t, z) and with nonzero elds
given by ax(t, z), ay(t, z), ex(t, z), ey(t, z), bx(t, z) and by(t, z), with ex = 0ax,
ey = 0ay, bx = zay and by = zax. we obtain the following set of four
equations,

0by + zex = 0 ,
0bx + zey = 0 ,
zbx  0ey = 0 ,
zby + 0ex = 0 .

(62)

then using the column-vector u = (ex, ey, bx, by) one nds that the characteristic
2)2 = 0, or in covariant form, (g)2 = 0.
equation is det(a) = (0
thus there is no birefringence in maxwells theory, a well known fact.

5.2 the gauss-bonnet lagrangian in kaluza-klein theory

as mentioned in the introduction one may consider another non-linear general-
ization of electrodynamics that can be derived from the kaluza-klein theory in ve
dimensions, and is based on the addition of the gauss-bonnet term, rabcd rabcd
4 rab rab + r2, which in ve dimensions is no more a topological invariant, but
leads to non-trivial equations of motion of second order when added to the usual
einstein-hilbert lagrangian r.

in a at space-time and without the scalar eld the kaluza-klein metric is

gab = (cid:18) g + aa a

1 (cid:19) ,

a

(63)

where a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3 (or ,  = 0, x, y, z following the coven-
tion we have been using). as mentioned the full lagrangian is taken to be (see
[9, 10]):

l = r +  (rabcd rabcd  4 rab rab + r2) ,

(64)

with  being a certain dimensional parameter characterizing the strength of the
non-linearity. when expressed in four dimensions in terms of the maxwell tensor,
it becomes

l = 

1
4

f f  

3
16

(ff )2  2 (fff f ) .

(65)

in terms of the invariants p and s this lagrangian is given by l = 2p + 3
for the choice  =  2
the equations of motion are:

2 s2, which
3 yields essentially the square of the born-infeld lagrangian.

f, + f, + f, = 0 ,

(66)

which correspond to the bianchi identities and are geometrical equations valid in-
dependently of the lagrangian chosen, and the dynamical equations resulting from
the variational principle,

[f  

3
2

(ff )f  +

3
2

ff f ], = 0 .

(67)

the lagrangian (65) is particularly simple when expressed in more familiar terms
with the elds e and b :

l =

1
2

(b2  e2) +

3
2

(e  b)2

(68)

the equations of motion also display a clear physical meaning when expressed in
terms of e and b. the equation (67) becomes

div b = 0,

rot e = 0b,

(69)

14

whereas the equations (68) become

div e = 3 b  grad (e  b)

rot b = 0e + 3 (cid:20) b0(e  b)  e  grad(e  b)(cid:21) .

(70)

which show how the density of charge and the current are created by the non-linearity
of the eld: indeed, we can introduce

 = 3 b  grad (e  b)
which satisfy the continuity equation

and

j = 3 (cid:20) b0(e  b)  e  grad(e  b)(cid:21) (71)

0 + div j = 0

(72)

the poynting vector conserves its form known from the maxwellian theory, but the
energy density is modied:

s = e  b,

1
2

e =

(e2 + b2) +

3
2

(e  b)2 ,

(73)

with the continuity equation resuming the energy conservation satised by virtue of
the equations of motion:

0e + divs = 0 .

(74)

the properties of possible stationary axisymmetric solutions, endowed with non-
vanishing charge, intrinsic kinetic and magnetic moments, have been discussed in
[9, 10]. in the theory based on the gauss-bonnet term in 5 dimensions, whose main
features were developed in section 1, the rst two equations of (62) are the same
here, but the dynamical equations are instead given by

(1  ex

(1  ey

2)zbx  (1 + by

2)0ey  bybx0ex  exby0bx  eyby0by

exbxzex  exeyzby  exbyzey = 0 ,

2)zby + (1 + bx

2)0ex + exbx0bx + bxby0ey + eybx0by

eybxzex  exeyzby  eybyzey = 0 .

(75)

using again the column-vector u = (ex, ey, bx, by) one nds that the characteristic
equation is now

h(0

2  z

2) + (bx

det(a) = (cid:16)0

2  z

2(cid:17)

= 0 .

2 + by

2)0

2 + 2(exby  eybx)0z + (ex

2 + ey

2)z

2i

(76)

this can be written in covariant form in a compact manner

(g) [(g  f 
15

f )] = 0 ,

(77)

where f   1
2f and  is the levi-civita tensor. thus from (64) we can
see that there is birefringence. one wave propagates in a maxwellian way, the other
propagates dierently, in fact, it is delayed.

indeed, if we set that the wavefront has the form  = aei(tkz), we nd two

solutions given by

and

k =  ,

(78)

(79)

.

k = q(e  b)2 + (1 + b2)(1  e2)  (e  b)

1  e2

for (79) one has that the wave velocity /k is in general less than one, and it lags
behind the other wave.

5.3 the born-infeld theory

now, in four dimensions there is a new invariant, s entering the born-infeld

action, which is

where, p = 1
f. in a lorentz frame one has that the action (68) is given by

4ff  and s = 1

l = 1 + 2p  s2 ,
4 ff , with f  = 1

(80)
2f being the dual of

l = q1 + (b2  e2)  (e  b)2.

(81)

for the restricted set of elds the local equations f 
, yield the same two rst
equations as in (62). the dynamical equation arise from varying the action (68)
with respect to a giving

l2f 

,  f  + f  = 0 ,

(82)

where   p,  ss, and   s  l2s,. if we develop (70) for  = x, y we
obtain the following equations,
2  ey
2  ex

2(b2  e2)  (e  b)2i 0ex
2(b2  e2)  (e  b)2i zby

h1 + by

+h2eyby + (e  b)(ey

2 + by

2) + (b2  e2)eybyi zey = 0 ,

(83)

and,

h1 + bx

2  ex

2  by

2(b2  e2)  (e  b)2i 0ey

16

h1 + by

2  ey

2 + ex

2(b2  e2)  (e  b)2i zbx

+ [(exby + eybx) + (e  b)(exey + bxby)  (b2  e2)exby] 0bx
+ [(exey  bxby) + (e  b)(exby + eybx)  (b2  e2)bxby] 0ex

+h2eyby + (e  b)(ey

2 + by

2)  (b2  e2)eybyi 0by

+ [(exey  bxby) + (e  b)(exby  eybx)  (b2  e2)exey] zby
 [(exby + eybx) + (e  b)(exey + bxby) + (b2  e2)exby] zey

h2exbx + (e  b)(ex

2 + bx

2) + (b2  e2)exbxi zex = 0 .

then using the column-vector u = (ex, ey, bx, by) one nds that the characteristic
equation det(a) = 0 is a quartic equation in 0 and in z. expanding this
equation and using boillats results one nds that the characteristic equation is

h(p + 1)g +  ih(p  1)g +  i  = 0 ,

where   = p g  f f 
 is the maxwellian energy-momentum tensor. we see
that in principle there is birefringence, i.e four solutions (two pairs of advanced and
retarded waves) for the born-infeld theory. however, boillat [1] shows that if the
weak energy condition is obeyed then the only valid characteristic equation is given
by

h(p + 1)g +  i  = 0 .

5.4 born-infeld theory in kaluza-klein space

in ve kaluza-klein dimensions one has to evaluate the determinant:

thus

as before, p = 1
i = 1

4 ff , s = 1

2ff g  f f 

2,,( 1
for the full case one encounters huge and intractable equations.

in order to
simplify the problem we suppose a constant electromagnetic background f =
a constant tensor. in this case the lagrangian reduces to

).

where  = 1

2 ,, and  is also a constant and symmetric tensor given by

l = 1 + 2 ,

(89)

f  f 

  (1 + 2p )g
1 + 2p  s2

17

(90)

then the equation of motion for  is

(1 + 2),,  ,,, = 0 .

(91)

we suppose now that the scalar eld  propagates in the (t, z) directions with
 = 0 and  = z. we are also assuming, as before, ez = 0 and bz = 0. in
addition, by choosing appropriately the directions of the elds e and b one can
study a situation in which the relevant conponents of  are 00 and zz alone,
with 0z = 0. this can be achieved in three distinct situations: (i) ex = ey = 0, (ii)
1+2p s 2 , and zz = 1e2
ex = bx = 0, or (iii) ey = by = 0. then, 00 =  1+b2
1+2p s 2
and xx, yy are non-zero but not relevant to the problem. to simplify the notation
we write 00 = l and zz = m. with these assumptions the equation of motion
takes the form

 l 0 + mz  lm (z  z)  lm (0  0) .

(92)

taking into account the internal equation 0  z = 0, the matrix a is
lm  0 + m (1  l 2) z(cid:19) .

l (1 + m2) 0 + lm  z

0

a = (cid:18)

z

its determinant yields the following characteristic equation

l 0

2  m z

2 + lm (2 0

2  2 0 z + 2 z

2) = 0 .

equation (94) can be written in a covariant form

    + ( ,,  2 )   = 0 .

(93)

(94)

(95)

in vacuum  = g and (95) reduces to the propagation of a scalar born-infeld
eld g  + (,,  g ,,)   = 0.
in order to nd k() we put the ansatz  = aei(tkz) into equation (94) yielding

k = s l

m

1  l 2 + m 2  lm 

1  l 2

.

(96)

one can study various limits. in particular, an interesting case occurs when 2 
2    0 and e2  b2 << 1. then the velocity of propagation of the wave is
v = 
m = 1   with  << 1. in this example we recover the propagation of a
linear scalar eld in smooth electromagnetic background.

k = q l

6. conclusion

in the present article we have shown how various multi-dimensional generaliza-
tions of the born-infeld theory lead to complicated interactions between the electro-
magnetic and dilaton elds. the exceptional character of this theory is lost as soon
as the dilaton eld appears, induced by the extra kaluza-klein dimension. only in

18

very low dimensions the birefringence is not observed; in four space-time dimensions
it appears in all the generalizations of the born-infeld theory.

considering the born-infeld theory as derived from an eective lagrangian of a
multi-dimensional string lagrangian, we come to the conclusion that the features
that were particularly interesting in classical version are lost due to the emergence
of highly non-linear couplings between all the elds present in the theory.
