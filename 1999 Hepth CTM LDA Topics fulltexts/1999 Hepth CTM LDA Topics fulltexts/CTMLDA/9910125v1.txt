abstract

new s-dualities in a scale invariant n = 2 gauge theory with su(2)  su(2) gauge
group are derived from embeddings of the theory in two dierent larger asymptoti-
cally free theories. the true coupling space of the scale invariant theory is a 20-fold
identication of the coupling space found in the m- and string-theory derivations of
the low energy eective action, implying a larger s-duality group. also, this coupling
space is dierent from the naively expected direct product of two sl(2, z) fundamental
domains, as it contains a dierent topology of xed points.

1 introduction and summary

one of the most striking elements in recent developments in our understanding of gauge
theories and string theories is the ubiquitous appearance of s-dualities in theories with
8 or more supercharges. s-duality denotes the exact equivalence of a theory at weak
coupling to another theory at strong coupling.
it can be described in general as a
set of identications on the space of couplings of a theory (or theories). well-known
examples in four-dimensional eld theory are the n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills
theories [1] and nite n = 2 theories [2][8]. in n = 4 theories, for example, s-duality
identies theories with gauge couplings  and 1/ .

the s-dualities of classes of scale invariant n = 2 gauge theories with simple gauge
groups [9] and product gauge groups [10] were derived by embedding those theories in
higher rank asymptotically free gauge theories. the coupling space of the scale invari-
ant theory was realized as a submanifold of the coulomb branch of the asymptotically
free theory. these embedding arguments by themselves do not necessarily capture all
possible s-dualitiesthere may be further identications of the coupling spacesince
they only show that a submanifold of the coulomb branch of the appropriate asymp-
totically free theory is some multiple cover of the true coupling space. one place where
we know such further identications must exist are in theories with su(2) gauge group
factors: for in the limit that the other factors decouple, the remaining su(2) factor
must have the full sl(2, z) duality of [2], rather than the subgroup 0(2)  sl(2, z)
which emerges from the embedding argument. the purpose of this letter is to explore
these further s-dualities in a scale invariant n = 2 gauge theory with su(2)  su(2)
gauge group.

the specic theory we focus on has massless hypermultiplets in the representations
(2, 2)  (2, 1)  (2, 1)  (1, 2)  (1, 2) of su(2)  su(2). it has two exactly marginal
complex gauge couplings, 1 and 2, which are conveniently parameterized by fk = eik
(so that weak coupling is at fk = 0). the new s-dualities we nd act as a 20-fold
identication on c2  {f1, f2}, and are described explicitly in eqns. (5053) below.
the resulting coupling space has a single z3 orbifold xed point, complex lines of
z2 orbifold xed points intersecting in an s3 orbifold point, and no further strong
coupling singularities. the weak coupling singularities have the expected structure: in
the limit that one coupling vanishes, the s-duality group acts as sl(2, z) on the other
coupling; nevertheless, the total coupling space is not simply the cartesian product of
two sl(2, z) fundamental domains.

this paper is organized as follows. in the next section we review the proof of the

1

s-duality of the su(2) gauge theory [9], clarifying in what sense the sl(2, z) group of
identications on the coupling space can be recovered. in section 3 we study the low
energy eective action on the coulomb branch of our scale invariant su(2)  su(2)
theory. we derive two dierent forms of the curve encoding this eective action by
embedding the theory in either an su(n)  su(n) or an su(2n)  sp(2n) theory.
demanding that the resulting curves describe equivalent low energy physics implies a
non-trivial mapping between the coupling parameters that appear in each description.
in section 4 we use this mapping and the results of [10] to prove that there are the
extra s-duality identications described above.

2 deriving the sl(2,z) duality of the su(2) theory

the n = 2 theory with su(2)  sp(2) gauge group and four massless fundamental
hypermultiplets is a scale invariant theory with an exactly marginal coupling, the
complex gauge coupling  , taking values in the classical coupling space mcl = {|im >
in [2] evidence was presented, in the form of the invariance of the low energy
0}.
eective action, that the true coupling space of this theory should be the classical
space further identied under the transformations t :    + 1 and s :   1/ .
this gives the coupling space as m = mcl/sl(2, z), and sl(2, z) is said to be the
s-duality group of the theory.1

on the other hand, the duality identications manifest in the low energy eective
action of this su(2) gauge theory derived from either the m-theory construction of [5]
or the geometrical engineering of [7] do not comprise the full sl(2, z) s-duality group
conjectured in [2]. it was shown in [9] that the true coupling space of the scale invariant
su(2) gauge theory can be derived from its dierent covering spaces represented by
submanifolds of coulomb branches of two dierent embeddings of this theory in higher
rank asymptotically free theories. in this section we review this argument and clarify
the relation between the geometry of the covering of the coupling space and the s-
duality group.

consider rst the scale invariant su(2) theory with four massless hypermultiplets
in the fundamental representation. the coulomb branch of the theory is described by
the curve [2, 3]

1we only discuss the s-duality action on marginal couplings and not on masses or other operators,

y2 = (v2  u)2  4f v4,

(1)

and so will ignore the distinction between sl(2, z) and p sl(2, z) in what follows.

parameterized by the gauge coupling f and the gauge invariant adjoint vev u, a local
coordinate on the coulomb branch. f is a function of the coupling such that f  ei at
weak coupling.2 embedding this theory into the asymptotically free su(3) model with
4 quarks and scaling on the coulomb branch of the latter (while tuning appropriately
the masses of the quarks) to the scale invariant su(2) theory one identies [9] the
coupling space msu = {f} with p1 with two punctures and an orbifold point: a weak
coupling singularity f = 0, an ultra-strong coupling point at f = 1/4, and a z2
orbifold singularity at f = .

on the other hand, this scale invariant n = 2 su(2) gauge theory can be thought

of as an sp(2) theory with 4 massless fundamental avors, whose curve reads [4]

y2 = x(x  v)2  4gx3.

(2)

the coupling space msp = {g} of this theory was derived in [9] from its embedding
in asymptotically free sp(4) theory with 4 massless hypermultiplets by tuning on the
coulomb branch of the latter to the scale invariant sp(2) theory. one then nds that
msp is again the complex manifold p1 with two punctures and an orbifold point: a
weak coupling singularity at g = 0, an ultra-strong singularity at g = 1/4, and a z2
orbifold singularity at g = .

both the su(2) and the sp(2) descriptions of the scale invariant theory must describe
the same physics.
in particular, their low energy eective actions described by the
complex structure of the curves (1) and (2) must be the same. we therefore look for
an sl(2, c) transformation on x which maps the zeros of the right sides to one another.
of the six distinct such mappings only two map weak coupling to weak coupling, and
imply the identication

f =

4g(1 + 2g)
(1 + 6g)2

.

(3)

choosing dierent signs of the square root gives two maps between msp and msu ,
which induce the nontrivial identication u on msu

where  is a root of

u(f ) =

 + 2

( + 3)2

0 = f 2 +  + 1.

(4)

(5)

2in the n = 2 theories discussed here it is convenient to dene the coupling as  = 

 + i 8
g2 ,

diering by a factor of two from the usual denition.

3

this gives two maps from msu to itself, one for each  satisfying (5). thus these
identications imply at least a three-fold identication on msu (the original point
and its two images). in fact, a little algebra shows that the orbit of a generic point
under u is just this set of three points, so msu is a triple cover of the true coupling
space of the scale invariant su(2) theory. in particular, the identications (4) map the
strong coupling point f = 1/4 to the f = 0 weak coupling singularity, and map the
z2 point f =  to the point f = 2/9. in addition, there is a new xed point under
these identications, namely f = 1/3, which it is easy to check is a z3 orbifold point.
the net result is that with these further identications, the coupling space becomes
topologically a sphere with three special points: the weak coupling puncture (the image
of f = 0 or 1/4), a z2 orbifold point (the image of f = 2/9 or ), and a z3 orbifold
point (the image of f = 1/3). since the map (4) is analytic, the true coupling space
inherits a complex structure from that of the punctured f -sphere. the order of the
orbifold points reects the nature of the singularity in the complex structure at the
punctures.

this argument shows that there are indeed more identications on the coupling
space than were apparent in either the su(2) form of the curve (1) or the sp(2) form
of the curve (2). but it might not be clear from this argument how to actually see
the sl(2, z) structure of the duality group. for this we need an intrinsic denition of
what we mean by duality group. since having an s-duality group  means that the
coupling space is given by m = mcl/, and the classical coupling space mcl is simply
connected, we can dene [5]

 = 1(m).

(6)

when m has orbifold singularities, 1(m) should be understood in the orbifold sense
[5], meaning that the generator u of 1(m) corresponding to looping about a zn
orbifold point satises u n = 1.

the true su(2) coupling space deduced above has the complex structure of a sphere
with one puncture, a z2 orbifold point, and a z3 orbifold point. thus the s-duality
group 1(m) has two generators which we can take to be u, generating loops around
the z2 point, and v , generating loops around the z3 point, and satisfying u 2 = v 3 = 1.
there are no other constraints since we know that going around the weak coupling
puncture is a -angle rotation, which does not correspond to any orbifold identication.
but sl(2, z), considered as an abstract innite discrete group, can be presented as
the group with two generators s and t satisfying only the relations s2 = (st )3 = 1.
so, identifying s = u and st = v , we see that the s-duality group is isomorphic to

4

sl(2, z).

3 curves for the su(2) x su(2) theory

in preparation for our discussion of s-duality in the su(2)  su(2) scale invariant
theory, we must rst make a somewhat lengthy technical detour to derive useful forms
for the curves whose complex structure encodes the low energy physics of the coulomb
branch of the theory. the dierent curves we need are those arising from viewing the
su(2)  su(2) theory as part of an su(n)  su(n) series or as part of an su(2n) 
sp(2n) series. the goal of this section is to derive an explicit map between the couplings
of the two versions of the theorythe analog of eq. (3) above. this map is summarized
at the end of this section for those who prefer to skip the technicalities.

we start by briey reviewing the derivation [5] of the su  su curves from an
m5 brane conguration in m-theory. in subsection 3.2 we then derive curves for the
su  sp series with fundamental matter using an m5 brane conguration on r7  q
where q is the atiyah-hitchin manifold, corresponding to a negatively charged o6
orientifold in a type iia string picture. in subsection 3.3 we specialize to vanishing
bare masses for the matter hypermultiplets in the su(2)  su(2) and su(2)  sp(2)
curves, develop hyperelliptic forms for both curves, and then derive the mapping of
parameters matching the two. in subsection 3.4 we summarize the results of this section
relevant for our discussion of s-duality.

3.1 su x su curves

consider the scale invariant su(n)  su(n) theory with one hypermultiplet in the
bifundamental, n in the rst su(n) fundamental, and n in the second su(n) funda-
mental. this can be realized as a iia brane conguration by placing three ns5 branes
along the x05 directions separated in x6 but located at equal values in x79, and n
d4 branes along the x03 and x6 directions suspended between neighboring pairs of
ns5 branes. the fundamental matter is incorporated by including n semi-innite d4
branes extending to the right and left in the x6 direction.

it is easy to lift such a brane conguration to an m-theory curve [5]

f (t, v)  p(v)t3 + q(v)t2 + r(v)t + s(v) = 0,

where v = x4 + ix5, t = exp{(x6 + ix10)/r}, x10 is the eleventh dimension of radius r.

 + m).

s =

(8)

the leading coecients of p and s are set to 1 by rescaling t and v, and by a shift

in v we set pk ak = pj bj = 0. interpreting the positions in the v plane of the d4

and m(2)
branes as mass parameters or coulomb branch vevs, we nd that the m(1)

are the bare masses of the fundamentals of the rst and the second su factors, m is
the bifundamental mass, and the traceless ak and bj are the eigenvalues of the adjoint
vevs of the rst and the second su factors.

the bi in (8) encode the gauge couplings through the relative asymptotic positions of
the ns5 branes in the iia picture. these positions are given by the roots of f (t, v) = 0
for large v, that is, the roots of t3 + b1t2 + b2t + 1 = 0. the relative positions of these
roots are unaected by the z3 transformation of the coecients bi

the low-energy physics on the coulomb branch of this su(n)  su(n) theory is the
space c2  {b1, b2} modded by the z3 action (9). furthermore, in addition to
the z3 orbifold xed point at b1 = b2 = 0, this space has singularities whenever
the asymptotic positions of the m5 branes collidewhenever 0 = 27  18b1b2

couplings can be parameterized by the z3-invariant combinations f1  b1/b2

1, which have been chosen to correspond to the normalization of the su(2)
coupling f used in (1), so that they are related to gauge couplings at weak coupling as
{f1, f2}  {ei1, ei2}.

we can check this identication of the coupling parameters (as well as our implicit
identication of the vevs and bare masses in the su  su curve) by decoupling one
of the su factors by taking one of the ns5 branes o to innity. for example, we can

3.2 su x sp curves

consider the scale invariant su(2n)  sp(2n) theory with one hypermultiplet in the
bifundamental, 2n in the su(2n) fundamental, and 2 in the sp(2n) fundamental. this
can be realized as a iia brane conguration in the presence of an o6 orientifold plane
of negative rr charge [8]. the o6 plane is the xed point of a z2 quotient which acts
on the space-time coordinates as x4,5,6  x4,5,6, and thus extends along the x03 and
x79 directions, and is located at x46 = 0. it is convenient to work on the double cover,
by including mirror images for all branes, where the o6 plane has rr charge -8 in d6
brane units. the su(2n)sp(2n) gauge theory is then constructed by placing two ns5
branes (and their mirror images) along the x05 directions separated in x6 but located
at equal values in x79, and 2n d4 branes along the x03 and x6 directions suspended
between neighboring pairs of ns5 branes. the fundamental matter is incorporated by
including d6 branes parallel to the o6 plane: two between the o6 plane and the
rst ns5 brane, and 2n between the two ns5 branes (as well as their mirror images).

following [13], we can derive the curve for this brane conguration by rst moving
the d6 branes to left and right innity, whereupon they drag d4 branes behind them
upon passing through any ns5 branes [14]. also, we can represent the o6 plane as a
neutral o6 plane by pulling in 2 d6 branes (and their mirror images) from innity to
cancel the o6 plane rr charge. upon passing through the ns5 branes, the d6 branes
create two d4 branes between the ns5 branes and four between the ns5 brane and
the o6 plane (as well as their mirror images). thus the nal conguration is simply

7

four ns5 branes crossed by 2n + 4 innite d4 branes, all arranged symmetrically with
respect to the origin of x46.

it is easy to lift such a brane conguration to the m-theory curve

f (t, v)  p(v)t4 + q(v)t3 + r(v)t2 + q(v)t + p(v) = 0

(12)

where v = x4 + ix5, t = exp{(x6 + ix10)/r}, x10 is the eleventh dimension of radius r;
p, q and r are polynomials of degree 2n + 4, r(v) = r(v), and the z2 identication is
lifted to

(v, t)  (v, 1/t).

(13)

the condition that there be an o6 plane implies [8] that this curve be non-singular on
the atiyah-hitchin space. as discussed in [13], this in turns implies that (f/v)|v=0
has a zero of order 4   at t = 1 for  = 0, . . . , 3, giving

p =

2yi=1
(v  mi)2 

q = 4p[0] + 2vp[1] + a1  v2 
r = 6p[0] + 2v2(q[2]  p[2]) + a2  v4

(v  j  m),
2nyk=1
2yi=1
(v  mi) 
(v  ak  m),
ny=1
(v2  b2
 ),

(14)

where p[n] refers to the coecient of vn in p(v). interpreting the positions in the v
plane of the d4 branes as mass parameters or coulomb branch vevs, we nd that
the mi are the bare masses of the two sp fundamentals, j are the masses of the su
fundamentals, m is the bifundamental mass, the traceless ak are the eigenvalues of the
su adjoint vev, and the b likewise for the sp adjoint vev.

the ai in (14) encode the gauge couplings through the relative asymptotic positions
of the ns5 branes in the iia picture. these positions are given by the roots of f (t, v) =
0 for large v, that is, the roots of t4 + a1t3 + a2t2 + a1t + 1 = 0. the relative positions
of these roots are unaected by the z2 transformation of the ai coecients

(a1, a2)  (a1, a2).

(15)

thus the space msu sp of inequivalent couplings that enters into the low-energy physics
on the coulomb branch of this su(2n)  sp(2n) theory is the space c2  {a1, a2}
modded by the z2 action (15). furthermore, in addition to the line of z2 orbifold xed
points at a1 = 0, this space has strong coupling singularities whenever the asymptotic
positions of the m5 branes collide, which is when a2 + 2 = 2a1 or a2
1 = 4a2  8, as

8

well as weak coupling singularities whenever one of the m5 branes goes o to innity:
a1   or a2  . indeed, the space of su  sp couplings can be parameterized by
the z2-invariant combinations g1  a2/a2
2, which have been chosen to
correspond to the normalization of the su and sp couplings used in the last section,
so that they are related to gauge couplings at weak coupling as {g1, g2}  {ei1, ei2}
where 1 is the su coupling and 2 the sp coupling.

1 and g2  a2

1/a2

we can check this identication of the coupling parameters (as well as our implicit
identication of the vevs and bare masses) in the su  sp curve by decoupling the
sp factor (g1 xed, ai  ) or the su factor (g2 xed, ai  ). decoupling the
sp factor leads to considerations very similar to those discussed above in the case
of the su  su curve, so we consider only the decoupling of the su factor. this
decoupling is also interesting since it involves passing from the {v, t} space which is a
double cover of the orbifold space, to the single-valued coordinates which resolve the
orbifold singularity appropriately. we will need to do the same change of variables on
the su(2)  sp(2) curve in the next subsection.

the su  sp curve (12) then becomes

0 = t(cid:16)q(v)t2 + r(v)t + q(v)(cid:17) .

(16)

the overall factor of t is for the decoupled brane, and the remaining polynomial be-

genus-n sp(2n) curves, we must divide out the orbifold identications (13). to do this,
dene the invariant coordinates

note that the change of variables (18) is singular when v = 0; it serves to resolve

of the o6 plane singularity [16]. in these variables, the curve (17) becomes

3.3 su(2) x su(2) and su(2) x sp(2) scale invariant curves

we now specialize to the su(2)  su(2) and su(2)  sp(2) theories which are of
interest for the s-duality argument.

consider rst the su(2)  su(2) scale invariant theory with zero bare masses for

the hypermultiplets. from (7, 8) the coulomb branch of this theory is described by

t3v2 + b1t2(v2  u1) + b2t(v2  u2) + v2 = 0,

(22)

where u1 = b1b2 and u2 = a1a2 denote the coulomb branch moduli of the two
su(2)s. to study degenerations of (22) on the coulomb branch it is convenient to
represent it as a double cover of the complex t plane:

the change of variables

v2 =

t(b1u1t + b2u2)

(t3 + b1t2 + b2t + 1)

.

y = (t3 + b1t2 + b2t + 1)v

takes (23) to the hyperelliptic form

y2 = t(b1u1t + b2u2)(t3 + b1t2 + b2t + 1).

(23)

(24)

(25)

10

we pause here to discuss the validity of changes of variables like (24), which we will
use again below on the su(2) sp(2) curve, and which we also used in the decoupling
checks of the last subsections. it is important that the complex structures of curves
related by these changes of variables are the same since we will match the parameters
of the su(2)  su(2) and su(2)  sp(2) curves by comparing the complex structures
of their hyperelliptic forms. the issue is the apparent singularity of the change of
variables (24) whenever t3 + b1t2 + b2t + 1 = 0. in fact this change of variables, when
properly understood, is not singular on the curve, and so the resulting hyperelliptic
curve (25) is equivalent to (has the same complex structure as) the prior curve (23).

the key point lies in the treatment of the points at innity on the curves. let us

generalize to a situation where we have a curve of the form

myi=1
(t  ei),

o to innity as t  fj and t  . we can compactify this curve by replacing the
{v, t} space with an appropriate projective space; the correct choice of projective space
is determined by demanding that the genus of the resulting compact surface indeed
be m  1. this is achieved if each innity t  fi is replaced by a single point, while
the t   innity is compactied at two distinct points. the appropriate projective
space which does this is the direct product of two riemann spheres, p1  p1, which
can be dened as c4 = {u, v, s, t} modulo the identications {u, v, s, t}  {u, v, s, t}
for   c, and {u, v, x, z}  {u, v, s, t} for   c. the curve is homogenized
to v2qm
i=1(t  eis). the innities of the {v, t} = c2 space are
compactied to two (intersecting) copies of p1 in p1  p1, while the homogeneous
curve intersects these innities at the points {u, v, s, t} = {0, 1, 1, fj} (corresponding
to t  fj) and {1,1, 0, 1} (corresponding to t  ).
we are interested in the change of variables y = vqm
j=1(tfj) which in homogeneous
coordinates can be written y = (v/u) qm
j=1(t  fjs), x = t, z = s. the p1  p1
identications on {u, v, s, t} imply {y, x, z}  {my, x, z} for   c, which denes
a point in the weighted projective space p2
(m,1,1). this is a smooth space except for
a zm orbifold singularity at the point {y, x, z} = {1, 0, 0}. the change of variables
thought of as a map from p1  p1  p2
(m,1,1) is singular on the p1 at v =  which
is mapped to the zm orbifold point of p2
(m,1,1), except for the points {v, t} = {, fi}
which are blown up to the p1 of points {y, x, z} = {, fi, 1}.

11

the image of the homogeneous curve under this change of variables is the genus

m  1 hyperelliptic curve

y2 =

myi=1
(x  eiz)(x  fiz),

(27)

(m,1,1) if qi eifi 6= 0. in particular,
which does not intersect the zm orbifold point of p2
the p1  p1 curve approaches the points {u, v, s, t} = {0, 1, 1, fj} in such a way that
their images in p2
(m,1,1) miss the orbifold point. therefore the change of variables is
a holomorphic mapping between the abstract riemann surfaces, and so equates their
complex structures.

in the case of the su(2)su(2) curve (23) the fi are roots of t3 +b1t2 +b2t+1 = 0,
while the ei are 0, (b2u2)/(b1u1), and . the branch points at zero and innity
are harmless as can be seen by the fact that an sl(2, c) transformation on the {s, t}
p1 preserves the complex structure of the curve and can be used to move all branch
points to nite points on the t plane.

we return now to discuss the su(2)  sp(2) theory. from (12) and (14) the curve
of the scale invariant su(2)  sp(2) theory with zero hypermultiplet masses is given
by

v2t4 + a1(v2  v1)t3 + a2(v2  v2)t2 + a1(v2  v1)t + v2 = 0,

(28)

where v1 = a1a2 and v2 = b2
1 are coulomb branch moduli of the su and sp factor
respectively. this curve is of the form (26) with m = 4 (and one fj at innity), thus
describing a genus 3 riemann surface (as is also clear from its brane construction). it
was supposed to be equivalent to the su(2)  su(2) curve, which was genus 2. the
reason for the mismatch is that the su(2)sp(2) curve was constructed on the double
cover of the o6 plane orbifold space.

changing to single-valued variables on the orbifold space via (18), which parame-
terize the non-singular atiyah-hitchin space [15] (the m theory resolution of the space
transverse to the o6 plane [16]), gives the curve (28) as the intersection of the surfaces

y2 = xz2  4z,
0 = x((xz  2)2  2) + a1(x  v1)(xz  2) + a2(x  v2).

(29)

change variables by s = xz  2, leaving x and y unchanged. then the curve becomes
the intersection

xy2 = s2  4,

0 = x(s2  2) + a1(x  v1)s + a2(x  v2).

(30)

12

this change of variables is singular at x = 0 which is a direction at innity on the
curve. as in the discussion above, as long as we treat the points at innity correctly
so as to preserve the genus of the curve, the complex structure will be preserved by
the change of variables. eliminating x from (30) gives the curve

y2 =

(s2  4)(s2 + a1s + a2  2)

(a1v1s + a2v2)

.

(31)

(x was the right variable to eliminate since only x is single valued on the atiyah-
hitchin space, which is a double cover of the y-z plane.) finally, by the type of change
of variables discussed above, w = (a1v1s + a2v2)y, the genus 2 curve emerges in the
hyperelliptic form

w2 = (a1v1s + a2v2)(s2  4)(s2 + a1s + a2  2).

(32)

since the su(2)su(2) and su(2)sp(2) theories are physically identical, the two
genus 2 hyperelliptic curves (25) and (32) must have the same complex structure as a
function of the couplings and vevs. thus there must be an sl(2, c) transformation
relating t and s which maps the branch points of (25) to those of (32). if we map the
branch points at innity to each other, and the branch point at s = 2 to the one at
t = 0, then we must nd a linear transformation 4t = s + 2 and a map between the
vevs and couplings which satises

(a1v1s + a2v2)(s 2)(s2 + a1s + a2  2)  (b1u1t + b2u2)(t3 + b1t2 + b2t + 1), (33)
for some . since the theory is scale-invariant, we can choose an arbitrary relative
scaling of the u and v vevs so that u1 = v1. we then nd the following relations
between couplings,

a1 = 8 + 4b1,
a2 = 30 + 24b1 + 162b2,
0 = 1 + b1 + 2b2 + 3,

(34)

while the vevs are related by v1 = u1 and (a2/a1)v2 = 2u1 + 4(b2/b1)u2. these
matching relations are the main result of this section. they can be inverted to read

b1 = (a1  8)/(4),
b2 = (a2  6a1 + 18)/(162),
163 = 2a1  a2  2,

13

(35)

for the couplings, with the vevs related by u1 = v1 and (b2/b1)u2 = [(a2/a1)v2 
2v1]/(4), corresponding to a map 4t = s + 2 between the curves.

finally, one can easily check that in the weak coupling limits, the above matching
of parameters reduces to the appropriate identications. for example, decoupling the
su(2) factor of the su(2)  sp(2) theory by sending ai   keeping g2 = a2
1/a2
2
xed (and thus g1  0), (35) implies that the su(2)  su(2) couplings go as

which recovers precisely the mapping (4) between the su(2) and sp(2) couplings used
in section 2, and is a non-trivial consistency check on the calculations of this section.

3.4 summary of su(2) x su(2) low energy coupling spaces

we now summarize what we have just derived about the space of couplings of the
su(2)su(2) theory as they appear in the low energy eective actions on the coulomb
branch described by the su(2)  su(2) and su(2)  sp(2) curves. we denote these
two spaces of couplings by msu su and msu sp respectively.

3.4.1 msu su
the su(2)  su(2) low energy eective action is described by two complex couplings
b1 and b2 which parameterize an msu su  c2/s3 orbifold space. the s3 orbifold
identications are generated by the z3 element

p : (b1, b2)  (b1, 2b2),

where  is a cube root of unity, as well as by the z2 element

q : (b1, b2)  (b2, b1)

(37)

(38)

which simply interchanges the two su(2) factors. resulting from the s3 identications,
msu su has three lines of z2 orbifold singularities when b1 = b2 which intersect in
an s3 orbifold point at b1 = b2 = 0. msu su also has strong-coupling singularities
when

0 = 27  18b1b2  b2

,

(40)

are related to the {1, 2} gauge couplings of the two su(2) factors by {f1, f2} 
{ei1, ei2} at weak coupling.

3.4.2 msu sp
the su(2)sp(2) curve, though describing the same theory, has a very dierent space
of couplings, a1 and a2, parameterizing the orbifold space msu sp  c2/z2. the z2
identication acts as

(41)
and gives rise to a line of z2 orbifold xed points in msu sp when a1 = 0. in addition,
msu sp has strong coupling singularities when

r : (a1, a2)  (a1, a2),

a2 + 2 = 2a1

or

a2
1 = 4a2  8,

(42)

as well as weak-coupling singularities when a1   or a2  . the z2-invariant

(43)

are related to the {1, 2} gauge couplings of the su(2) and sp(2) factors, respectively,
by {g1, g2}  {ei1, ei2} at weak coupling.

3.4.3 msu su  msu sp map
finally, the low energy su(2)  su(2) and su(2)  sp(2) descriptions of the theory
are found to be equivalent as long as the parameters of one theory are mapped to those
of the other by t : msu sp  msu su dened by

4 s-duality in the su(2) x su(2) theory

we will now derive the enlarged s-duality group of the su(2)  su(2) theory. the
idea is a straightforward generalization of the strategy used for a single su(2) factor
reviewed in section 2: the su(2)  su(2) model can be reached by owing down from
both the su(n)su(n) and su(2n)sp(2n) series. denoting by m the true coupling
space of the su(2)  su(2) theory, we therefore expect to nd some multiple cover
msu su of m as the coupling space realized by owing down in the su(n)  su(n)
series, and a dierent multiple cover msu sp by owing down in the su(2n)  sp(2n)
series. we then use the equivalence of the two descriptions of the theory to deduce a
map identifying msu su with msu sp. if this map is not a simple one-to-one map,
then we thereby deduce extra identications leading to the smaller coupling space
m and therefore a larger s-duality group 1(m).

the determination of msu su and msu sp is easy, as we have already done it in
[10]. there we showed that the embedding argument leads to a coupling space for the
su(n)su(n) theory which is precisely the msu su described above in eqns. (3739),
and likewise that the su(2n)  sp(2n) theory coupling space is the msu sp described
above in eqns. (4142). the map between msu su and msu sp is then the one derived
at length in the last section, and summarized in eqns. (4447). as this map is obviously
not one-to-one, we have therefore found new s-duality identications on the su(2) 
su(2) coupling space, which is what we aimed to show.

a  c2

b, we use it to construct maps from c2

the remainder of this section will be devoted to understanding some properties of
the msu su  msu sp map t (4447), and thereby of the the resulting enlarged
s-duality group,  = 1(m). we will refer to the c2 of bi parameters as c2
b and of
ai parameters c2
a. to see algebraically the extra identications induced on msu su
by the map t : c2
b to itself. note
rst that t and t 1 each have three image points corresponding to the three dierent
values that  or  can take. in the case of t , the three s dier only by cube root
of unity phases, and the three image points in c2
b are related by the z3 identication
p (37). one the other hand, the image of t 1 is generically three distinct points in
a unrelated by the z2 identication r (41). however, the images under t 1 of three
c2
points in c2
a, since a p action on the
bi just rotates the roots of (47), leaving (46) invariant.

b related by p are all the same three points in c2

since the t map commutes with p, we can formulate the identications directly on

16

f  c2
c2

b/{p} with coordinates fi given by (40). in these variables t becomes
(cid:18) f1
f2(cid:19) = t (cid:18) a1
(cid:19) ,
and t 1 reads

a2(cid:19) =(cid:18) 4(a1  8)(2a1  a2  2)(a2  6a1 + 18)2

(a2  6a1 + 18)(a1  8)2

(8f2 + 4)/f2

(30f2 + 24 + 162)/f2(cid:19) ,

a2(cid:19) = t 1(cid:18) f1
(cid:18) a1

f2(cid:19) =(cid:18)

(48)

(49)

where  is a root of

0 = f13 + 2 +  + f2.

(50)
note that while t is a single map, t 1 is generically three maps, one for each 
satisfying (50). nevertheless, it is easy to check that t  t 1 maps points in c2
f to
themselves, and it follows that repeated applications of t and t 1 generate no further
identications between c2

a and c2
f .

since msu su  c2

f /{q} and msu sp  c2

a/{r}, where q and r are the z2
identications q : f1  f2, and r : a1  a1, further identications will arise upon
combining t with r and q. it is algebraically easiest to work on c2
f where there are
three generators of non-trivial maps involving t , namely si  t  r  t 1. explicitly,
this map reads

si(cid:18) f1

f2(cid:19) =(cid:18) (4f2 + )(3f2 + 2 + 2)(6f2 + 3 + 2)2

f2(6f2 + 3 + 2)(4f2 + )2

(cid:19) ,

(51)

where  is a root of (50). the subscript on s denotes the three dierent choices of
roots for , which lead generically to three dierent image points in c2
f . thus the new
s-duality identications si that we have found imply at least a four-fold identication
on c2
f (the original point and its three images). furthermore, the orbit of a given
point under repeated applications of the si can be shown to be just this set of four
points. the z2 identication q on c2
f does not commute with the si, though it can
be shown that for a given si, there exist an sj and an sk such that siqsjqskq = 1.
the minimum orbit of a generic point satisfying these relations comprises 20 points,
as shown in fig. 1. in fact this is the generic orbit in c2
f under the complete set of
identications generated by si and q, as checked numerically.

in summary, because of the algebraic complexity of the si generators, we have been

unable to nd a simpler description of the resulting true coupling space m than

m  c2

f /{q,si}

with punctures at points satisfying (39) which reads in the fi coordinates:

0 = 1  4f1  4f2 + 18f1f2  27f 2

1 f 2
2 ,

(53)

as well as weak coupling singularities when f1f2 = 0. for clarity, we emphasize that
1(m)the s-duality group of mis not just the group generated by q and si.
there are many reasons for this: c2
f already has z3 orbifold points at f1 = f2 = 0
and f1 = f2 = ; q and si act with xed points; there are also strong and weak
coupling punctures on c2
f ; nally, q and si do not even generate a group since there
is no consistent labeling of the sithe three roots of (50)on the whole of c2
f .

we can, however, argue that m is not just the cartesian product of two copies of
the fundamental domain of sl(2, z) as one might naively have guessed. if it were this
product, m would have (complex) lines of z3 xed points, whereas it is straightforward
to check that q and s only have isolated z3 xed points which occur when (f1, f2) is
one of

(54)

in fact, these ve points are all identied under q and si, so there is only a single z3
xed point in m.

18

note that the rst two entries in (54) are the z3 points, identied in section 2, on
the coupling space of one su(2) factor in the limit where the other is decoupled. the
orbit of the z2 points f = 2/9, , of a single su(2) factor also includes points at
strong coupling:

(55)

in fact, there are whole (complex) lines of z2 xed points. though they are hard to
characterize explicitly, they all seem to be images of the q xed line f1 = f2 under si.
these images intersect in an s3 orbifold point whose orbit in c2

f is

(56)

these examples illustrate the interesting feature of the q and si maps that they
equate strong coupling puncturesfi satisfying (53)with weak coupling punctures
satisfying f1f2 = 0. this is true in general: all strong coupling punctures are so
identied with weak coupling points. to see this, note that f1 and f2 satisfy (53)
precisely when two roots of (50) coincide. a double root of  satises (50) and its rst
derivative: 0 = 3f12 + 2 + 1. rewriting this as f13 = (22 + )/3 and substituting
into (50) gives 2 + 2 + 3f2 = 0. but, by (51), this implies that si(f1) = 0 for this
choice of the root , and thus that the strong coupling puncture is mapped to a weak
coupling singularity. thus s-duality identications remove all ultra-strong coupling
points from m, just as in the case of the sl(2, z) duality of a single su(2) factor.

also, the point (1/3, 1/3) is special as its image under si depends on how one ap-
proaches it. generically, its image is the point (1/3, 0), but if one approaches it along
the particular direction (f1, f2) = (1/3)  (1 + , 1 +  + k3/2), then its image under si
is the whole (f, 0) plane, where f depends on k.

finally, one should bear in mind that all our arguments only show that the extra
identications on c2
f leading to m are necessary, but do not imply that there are no
further identications on m. in principle one could rule out the existence of further
identications from the low energy eective action on the coulomb branch by showing
that the low energy data is dierent at distinct points of m. though this is beyond
the scope of the present paper, one piece of evidence for there being no further identi-
cations on m is the fact, checked above (36), that in the limit where one of the su(2)
factors decouples, m already encodes the full sl(2, z) s-duality group of the other
su(2) factor.
