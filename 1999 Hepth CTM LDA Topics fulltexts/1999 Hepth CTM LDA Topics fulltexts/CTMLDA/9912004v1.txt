abstract

the action changes (and thus the vacuum conservation amplitudes) in the

proper-time representation are found for an accelerated mirror interacting

with scalar and spinor vacuum elds in 1 + 1 space. they are shown to

coincide to within the multiplier e2 with the action changes of electric and

scalar charges accelerated in 3 + 1 space. this coincidence is attributed to

the fact that the bose and fermi pairs emitted by a mirror have the same

spins 1 and 0 as do the photons and scalar quanta emitted by charges. it is

shown that the propagation of virtual pairs in 1 + 1 space can be described

by the causal greens function f (z, ) of the wave equation for 3 + 1 space.

this is because the pairs can have any positive mass and their propagation

function is represented by an integral of the causal propagation function of

a massive particle in 1 + 1 space over mass which coincides with f (z, ).

in this integral the lower limit  is chosen small, but nonzero, to eliminate

the infrared divergence. it is shown that the real and imaginary parts of the

action change are related by dispersion relations, in which a mass parameter

serves as the dispersion variable. they are a consequence of the same relations

for f (z, ). therefore, the appearance of the real part of the action change

is a direct consequence of the causality, according to which re f (z, ) 6= 0
only for timelike and zero intervals.

1. introduction

an intriguing symmetry between the creation of particle pairs by an accelerated mirror

in 1 + 1 space and the emission of single quanta by a charge accelerated as a mirror in 3 + 1

space was discovered in refs. 13. this symmetry is conned to coincidence of the spectra

of the bose and fermi pairs created by the mirror with the spectra of the photons and scalar

quanta emitted by electric and scalar charges, if the doubled frequencies  and  of the
quanta in a pair created by the mirror are identied with the components k = k0  k1 of
the 4-wave vector k of the quantum emitted by the charge:

2 = k+,

2 = k.

(1)

it was shown in ref. 3 that the bogolyubov coecients b

 and f

, which describe the

spectra of bose and fermi radiation of a mirror, are related to the fourier transforms of

the 4-current density j(k+, k) and the scalar charge density (k+, k), which describe the

spectra of photons and scalar quanta emitted by charges, by the following expressions1)

it was also shown that  

 is the source amplitude of a pair of particles which are only

potentially emitted to the right and to the left with the frequencies  and .

in other

words, it is the virtual-pair creation amplitude. the pair becomes real when one of its

particles undergoes internal reection with a frequency change and both particles move in

the same direction, i.e., to the right in the case of a right-sided mirror and to the left in

the case of a left-sided mirror. therefore, for a right-sided mirror, for example, the emission

amplitude hout |ini of a real pair of particles with the frequencies  and  is connected
with the virtual-pair creation amplitude  

 by the relation

hout |ini = x hout | ini

being an invariant of lorentz transformations along axis 1, is the mass of the virtual pair,

and, at the same time, it equals the transverse momentum k = pk2

real quantum emitted by the charge.

the fact that the source amplitude b

 of a virtual pair of bosons is specied by the

current j(k+, k), while the source amplitude f

 of a virtual pair of fermions is specied

by the scalar (k+, k), means that the spin of a boson pair equals 1, while the spin of a

fermion pair equals zero. thus, the coincidence between the emission spectra of a mirror

in 1 + 1 space and charges in 3 + 1 space can be attributed to the coincidence between the

moment of a pair emitted by the mirror and the spin of a particle emitted by the charge.3

the relation (2) can be written in the explicitly invariant form

(5)

(6)

(7)

where hout | ini is the amplitude of single-particle scattering on the mirror. the energy
and momentum of this real pair equal  +  and  + , i.e., the pair does not have mass,

nor do its components.

a virtual pair is another matter. according to (1), the zeroth and rst components of the

4-momentum k of a quantum emitted by a charge are equal to the energy and momentum

of a virtual pair of massless particles created by a mirror:

k0 =  + ,

k1 =   ,

and form the timelike 2-momentum of the pair in 1 + 1 space. clearly, the quantity

eb

 = kj/pk+k,

and, more specically, in the form of the scalar product of the 2-current vector j and the

2-polarization pseudovector a of a bose pair

the spacelike pseudovector a is constructed from the zeroth and rst components of the

4-momentum k of the quantum emitted by the mirror. it is orthogonal to the 2-momentum

of the pair, has a length equal to 1, and is represented in the comoving frame of the pair

only by a spatial component, as is the current vector j.

in this work we nd the vacuum conservation amplitude for acceleration of a mirror,

which is dened by the change w in the self-interaction of the mirror due to its acceleration.

the problem here is essentially nding re w from the previously found quantity im w ,

whose doubled value coincides in a certain approximation (see below) with the mean number

of real pairs formed by the mirror. three dierent methods are used for this purpose.

the rst (and principal) method is considered in sec. 2 and consists in transforming

the original space-time representation for the mean number of pairs into a proper-time

representation, whose kernel turns out to be the relativistically invariant singular even so-

lution (1/2)d1(z) of the wave equation in 3 + 1 space. then, the function d1(z) in the

expression obtained for the number of pairs is replaced by the even solution 1(z, ) of

the kleingordon equation in order to invariantly and symmetrically eliminate the infrared

divergence in the integral for the number of pairs using the small mass parameter  instead

of the large trajectory-length parameter l used in the original expression. the parame-
ters , l1  , if  is the characteristic acceleration on the trajectory. finally, treating
the function (1/2)1(z, ) as the imaginary part of the kernel dening w , by analytic

continuation with respect to z2 we can reconstruct a relativistically invariant and even in

z kernel which coincides with the causal greens function f (z, ) specic to 3 + 1 space.

the resultant action changes of a mirror and a charge dier only by the multiplier e2, and

the interactions are described by the same causal propagation function. thus, the dier-

ence in dimensionality of the spaces is compensated by the dierence in the mechanism of

interaction transfer: it is realized by pairs in 1 + 1 space and by individual particles in 3 + 1

space.

section 3 presents a direct calculation of the self-interaction changes w b,f

f

for a con-

crete, but fairly general mirror trajectory. the invariant functions of the relative velocity of

the trajectory ends obtained for w b,f

f

are consistent with the results of sec. 2.

in sec. 4 re wf is reconstructed from im wf using dispersion relations, in which 

4

appears as the dispersion variable. it is shown that the dispersion relations for wf are

a consequence of the same relations for f (z, ) with timelike z as the parameter. as a

consequence of causality only for such z the values of re f and re wf are nonzero and

are connected with im f and im wf , respectively, by the dispersion relations.

the fth section examines other analytic continuations of i1/2 onto the real z2 axis

that lead to kernels for w whose real parts are not even in z.

a physical interpretation of the results is presented in the sixth, concluding section. the

appearance of a causal propagation function characteristic for four-dimensional space-time

in two-dimensional space-time is attributed to interaction transfer by pairs of dierent mass.

2. proper-time representation of the change of action

the following representations were obtained in ref. 2 for mean numbers of radiated bose

and fermi particles:

n b,f =

1

du k b,f (u),

k b(u) =



(cid:30)z

g(v)  u  pf (u)

(10)

(11)

it follows from these representations for trajectories with the asymptotically constant veloc-

ities 1 and 2 at the ends and a nonzero lorentz-invariant relative velocity

21 =

2  1

,

 = tanh1 21,

(12)

that the mean number of massless quanta emitted is innite (there is infrared divergence).

in fact, in this case it follows from formulas (10) and (11) for u   (more precisely, for

5

|u|  1, i.e., outside the region where the mirror experiences the characteristic acceleration
) that the functions k b,f (u) possess universal behavior, which depends only on 21:

k b(u)

(13)

(14)

the relativistically invariant coecients accompanying u1 are formed on the parts of the

trajectories with asymptotically constant velocities. as a result, the mean number of quanta

emitted on the part of the trajectory covering the acceleration region grows logarithmically

as the length 2l of that part is increased:

n b =

n f =

22(cid:18) 

tanh   1(cid:19) ln(l) + 2bb(),
sinh (cid:19) ln(l) + 2bf (), l  1.



(15)

(16)

let us focus our attention on the fact that the odd (with respect to both u and ) term in

the asymptotics of k b(u) does not make a contribution to the integral dening n b. the
terms 2bb,f do not depend on l if l  1, but they can depend on the specic form of the
trajectories.

we note that there are representations for n b,f which dier from (9)(11) by mirror

symmetry, i.e., by the replacements u  v and f (u)  g(v). the integrands k b,f (v)

dening them dier from k b,f (u), but are denoted below by the same letter, since they are

values of the same functional taken for two mirror-symmetrical trajectories: k(u)  k[u; g]
and k(v)  k[v; f ]. as v  , k b,f (v) have asymptoticses which dier from (13) and
(14) by the replacements u  v and   .

in the creation of two or more pairs are neglected. we shall consider particle and antiparticle

to be nonidentical; otherwise, in the same approximation 2 im w = (1/2)n (see ref. 3).

now the main task is to nd re w . for this purpose, we obtain a suitable representa-

tion for im w and utilize relativistic-invariance and causality arguments.

let us consider the space-time representation for n which was the direct parent of the

representation (9)(11) [see ref. 2]. in this representation

n b =

0 , s(u, v) =

1

82 (cid:20)

(vf (u)i) (g(v)  ui)

+ c.c.(cid:21) .

(17)

we go over from the independent characteristic variables u and v to the proper-time moments

 and   of two points on the world trajectory of the mirror x( ):

u = x0( )  x1( ) = x( ),

v = x0( ) + x1( ) = x+( ).

(18)

then

f (u) = x0( ) + x1( ) = x+( ),

g(v) = x0( )  x1( ) = x( ),

(19)

and s(u, v) becomes a relativistically invariant function of the two-dimensional vector z =
x( )  x( )  (x  x) joining the points x = x( ) and x = x( ) on the mirror
trajectory:

(20)

the individual terms in (20) and their sum are well-known relativistically invariant singular

functions in quantum electrodynamics (we use the notation in ref. 4, but our d1 and 1

lack the multiplier i):

d(z) =

so that

s(z) = 

i

2(cid:2)d(z)  d+(z)(cid:3) =

d1(z).

(22)

we stress that these functions are singular solutions of the wave equation in 3 + 1 space,

if z is construed as a four-dimensional, rather than a two-dimensional, vector. here the

appearance of these functions, which depend on the 2-vector z, is a result of the deep

symmetry between the creation of a pair by a mirror in 1 + 1 space and the emission of

single quanta by a charge in 3 + 1 space.

in the form of a sum of terms which are even and odd with respect to the interchange    

(a dot denotes dierentiation with respect to the proper time), we obtain

(24)

it is natural to use an explicitly relativistic method that conserves the symmetry relative

to the interchange     to eliminate the infrared divergence in (24). it consists of replacing

the function d1 (z) by the function 1(z, ), which is also even in z and has the small mass

parameter   , where  is the characteristic acceleration of the mirror.

(where j1 and n1 are bessel and neumann functions, and r is a regular function of s) is

a singular solution of the wave equation in 3 + 1 space, which depends only on the interval

s = z2 between the two points and preserves all the features with respect to s at s = 0.

8

it is called the hadamard elementary function or the fundamental solution5. the coecient

in front of the logarithm, which is called the riemann function5, is a regular function of s,

which satises the same equation as 1. just these two functions will dene the imaginary

and real parts of the action change.

thus,

1(z, )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

in the expressions for n b the odd term is unessential, since d1(z) and 1(z, ) are even

relative to the replacement z  z.

now regarding n as the imaginary part of the doubled action, it is naturally to consider

the function (1/2)1(z, ) as imaginary part of some function f (z2), which is taken on the
real z2 axis, and which is analytic in the z2 complex plane with a cut along the z2  0
semiaxis, where lorentz invariance allows it to still depend on the sign of z0, and coincides

with (i/2)1(z, ) at z2 > 0. then the transition from in b to 2w is equivalent to the
analytic continuation of f (z2) onto the real semiaxis z2  0. it is well known6 that the
boundary value of such a function, which does not depend on the sign of z0 and is, therefore,

even, is the limit from above (  +0), which is called a causal function:

f (z, ) = f (z2 + i) =

k1(is) =

8s

[j1(s)  in1(s)] .

(27)

here k1 is the mcdonald function, and s = z2  i. the latter equality was written for
z2  0, where s  0 and f has a real part, which coincides with the riemann function
multiplied by /2. if z2 > 0, then s = iz2, f is purely imaginary, and its imaginary

part is positive.

thus, for w b

(28)

tation (17) for n b by the additional multiplier pf (u)g(v) under the integral. therefore,

mirror, but in 3 + 1 space, only by the absence of the multiplier e2.

at   0, the coecients in front of ln 1 in the imaginary parts of the proper-time
integrals (28) and (31) should coincide with the coecients in front of ln l in the correspond-

ing expressions for n b and n f [see (15) and (16)], since these coecients cannot depend

on the method used to eliminate the infrared divergence in the dierent representations for

each of quantities n b and n f .

since for an interval between two points on the timelike trajectory the

re f (z, ) = 


8s

j1(s)

(32)

and diers from the coecient in front of the logarithm in im f only by the multiplier /2

[see (27) and (25)], re wf also diers by the same multiplier from the coecient in front
of ln 1 in im wf . thus, to within terms which vanish at   0, we have

changes on parts of the trajectory containing other extreme values of the proper acceleration.

10

it is signicant that for  6= 0 the re wf = a has a nite positive limit at   0.
to conclude this section we recall that re wf is the acceleration-induced self-energy

shift of the source integrated over the proper time and that 2 im wf is the mean number

of emitted pairs (or emitted particles in the case of their nonidentity to the antiparticles).

more precisely, exp(2 im wf ) is the probability of the noncreation of pairs during the all
time of acceleration.

3. action change in the case of quasihyperbolic motion of

mirror

it would be interesting to directly calculate w b,f

f

for the special, but very important

mirror trajectory

x = (t) = vr v2



2 + t2,

(35)

which can be called quasihyperbolic. here v are the velocities of the mirror at t  ,
and  is its acceleration at the turning point (t = 0). this motion is remarkable in that as

v  1, it becomes increasingly close to uniformly accelerated (hyperbolic) motion over the
increasingly longer time interval

|t| . t1 =

v


(1  v2

)1/2,

smoothly going over to uniform motion outside this interval. this can be seen from the

expression for the magnitude of the acceleration in the proper frame

the spectrum and total radiated energy were found for an electric charge moving along the

trajectory (35) in ref. 7.

to calculate w b, in (28) instead of t we use the variable u, which is dened by the

formula

the subtraction |f

(43)

it can be seen from formulas (40)(42) that w b depends on two dimensionless parameters,

viz.,  and v = tanh(/2).

to calculate the asymptotics of the integral (40) at   0 we note that in this case the

explicit expressions for bb,f (). it can also be seen that w b,f do not depend on the sign
of  or 21, if we take into account that l2(1e2)+2 is an odd function of  [see landens
formula (1.12) in ref. 11]. we note in this connection that for small values of

the imaginary and real parts of w b,f in (46) and (50) are positive owing to unitarity

and causality. when  = 0, w vanishes, since the quasihyperbolic trajectory becomes

straight line.

purely hyperbolic trajectory for which 21 = 1 or 1 in accordance with the sign of . at a

(53)

here  = ||(2  1)  1, and when the length of proper time interval (1, 2) approaches
to innity the relative velocity 21 approaches +1 or 1. formula (53) was obtained for
uniformly accelerated charges in 3 + 1 space in ref. 12 and was discussed in detail in refs. 8

and 9. in those studies it dened the classical mass shift of a uniformly accelerated charge:

m1,0 = 

w1,0

=


2||s1,0().

(54)

in accordance with the unitarity and causality, the imaginary and real parts of m are

negative. at  = 0 the function m() is nonanalytic and, therefore, cannot be reproduced

by perturbation theory with respect to  or with respect to the eld accelerating the charge.

4. dispersion relations for w and their origin

it was shown in ref. 9 that the action changes ws(2) of point charges moving along

timelike trajectories as functions of the square of the mass of quanta of their proper-eld

with spin s = 1, 0 are analytic in the 2 complex plane with a cut along the positive 2

semiaxis, on whose edges the imaginary parts of each of the functions coincide, while the

real parts dier in sign. such functions satisfy the dispersion representations (im  < 0 ):

w (2) =



2i


z0

dx x re w (x2)

x2  2

2


= 



z0

dx im w (x2)

x2  2

,

(55)

which reconstruct the function ws(2) in the 2 complex plane from its real or imaginary

part assigned on the lower edge of the cut. when  = i and  > 0, these relations yield

the important equalities



2


z0

dx x re w (x2)

x2 + 2

=



2


z0

dx im w (x2)

x2 + 2

= im w (2) > 0,

(56)

15

re w (2) = 0.

(57)

as a consequence of unitarity, the im w (2) is positive on the real semiaxis 2 > 0.

then, according to the second of the representations (55), im w (2) is positive denite

over the entire 2 complex plane (or in the lower  half-plane).

here we show that the dispersion relations presented for w (2) are due to the analytic

properties of the causal greens function f (z, ), which, as we see, species not only

ws(2) for the vacuum amplitude of accelerated charges in 3+1 space, but also w b,f (2)

for the vacuum amplitude of an accelerated mirror in 1 + 1 space.

we can show that the causal function f (z, ) for a timelike z satises the dispersion

relations presented. according to formulas (2.12.4.28) and (2.13.3.20) from ref. 13



z0

dx x2j1(sx)

x2 + 2 = 



z0

dx xn1(sx)
x2 + 2 = k1(s),

(58)

where s, re  > 0. after the analytic continuation in  to the point  = i +  where  > 0

and   +0 these relations turn into



z0

dx x2j1(sx)
x2  2 + i

= i



z0

dx xn1(sx)
x2  2 + i

= ik1(is) =

2

[j1(s)  in1(s)] .

(59)

after multiplying by i/42s, they form the rst pair of dispersion relations (55), which,
instead of w (2), contain the causal function (27) with a timelike vector z, for which

s = z2 > 0. for spacelike z the interval s = iz2, and f (z, ) is purely imaginary.
after being multiplied by 1/42s, the original formulas (58) coincide with the sec-
ond pair of the relations (56) with the replacement of w (2) by f (z, ). the function

appearing on the right-hand side of these relations



42s



k1(s) = im f (z,i),

unlike im w (2), is negative. in addition,

re f (z,i) = 0,

16

(60)

(61)

as can be seen from (27). this property is a consequence of the causality, according to which

re f (z, ) = 0 outside the light cone, i.e., for spacelike z. in this case the argument of

the mcdonald function in (27) is real and positive. when we go over to timelike z and a

purely imaginary negative  = i, this argument remains real and positive, whence follows
(61).

while satisfying the dispersion relations (55) and (56) with respect to the dispersion

variable , the function f (z, ), unlike w (2), still depends on the xed as yet parameter

s, which equals the invariant interval between the two points chosen on the mirror trajectory

with the proper times  and  , i.e., on s = s(,  ). integrating the dispersion relations

for f over ,   with the weight (1/2) x( ) x( ) or 1/2 and performing the subtraction

procedure, we obtain the dispersion relations for w b or w f , if, of course, the familiar

conditions for changing the order of integration over x and ,   are satised.

thus, the dispersion relations for w (2) are a consequence of the dispersion relations

for f (z, ).

if follows from (56) that if im w (2) is bound at zero, then re w (2) must vanish
at   +0. if, on the other hand, at   0 the im w (2) logarithmically tends to innity
according to the relation

im w (2) = a ln 2 + b(2)

(62)

[a > 0, and b(2) is bound at zero], it follows from (56) that re w (2) tends to the

positive value re w (0) = a at   0. according to (57), this means that the function
re w (2) has a discontinuity equal to a on the real 2 axis at 2 = 0.

5. influence of the boundary conditions on re w

let us now consider the other boundary values of f (z2), which is analytic in the z2
complex plane with a cut along the z2  0 semiaxis and coincides with (i/2)1(z, ) on the
z2 > 0 semiaxis.

17

the limit f (z2 i) on the real axis from below is distinguished from the limit (27) from
above by the opposite sign of the real part. according to this function, free elds would

transfere negative energy in 3 + 1 space; therefore, this boundary condition is not considered

here.

the other boundary values of f (z2), which already depend on the sign of z0, may be the
limits f (z2  i sgn z0),   +0. they are positive- and negative-frequency functions, or,
more precisely, (z, ) (ref. 4):

 (z, ) = (z0) re f + i im f .

such functions naturally vary only the real part of the action obtained for f , so that

re w b

f and are given in the limit   0 by the expressions

8 zz d d  x x(z0)(z2).

the integrand can be expanded in   near   =  and represented in the form

 x x(z0)(z2) =  xx(   ).

here the equality |x|(x2) = (x) was used (see, for example, ref. 14).

then, integrating over   and expressing the proper-acceleration

a( ) =  x x =

2(f )3/2 =

(63)

(64)

(66)

(67)

(69)

because of the oddness of re  with respect to z.

the expressions obtained for re w up to the multiplier (8)1 coincide with the odd

in  coecients for the terms proportional to u1 and v1 in the asymptotic expansions of

k(u) and k(v), respectively [see (13) and (14) and the comment following eq. (16)]. at the

same time, re wf up to the same multiplier (8)1 coincides with the even in  coecient

for the term proportional to u1 or v1 in the asymptotic expansion of k(u) or k(v). we

note that all these coecients, as well as the functions k(u) and k(v) themselves, are formed

without any involvement of the parameter l, which eliminates the infrared divergence of

the space-time integrals (9) for the mean number of particles emitted.

thus, information on the interaction contained in k(u) and k(v), which determine

im w , is conveyed to re w owing to the causality and the boundary conditions.

in

addition, re wf contains information on the interaction which propagates within the light

cone, and re w contains information on the interaction which propagates along the light

cone and is therefore local owing to the timelike character of the trajectory.

as we know,4 the half-sum of the retarded and advanced elds is the proper-eld of the

source, and their half-dierence is the radiation eld escaping to innity. since

and

re f =

1

2(cid:0)ret + adv(cid:1) ,

re + =

1

2(cid:0)ret  adv(cid:1) ,

re wf describes the self-energy shift of the source, and re w+ describes the interaction

with the radiation eld, i.e., with real quanta. the boundary condition which eliminates

the interaction with virtual quanta or pairs seems unnatural.

6. discussion and physical interpretation of results

the proper-time representations for the changes in the self-interaction of a mirror upon

acceleration in a two-dimensional vacuum of scalar and spinor elds can be considered the

19

most signicant results of this work. these representations coincided with the represen-

tations for the changes in the self-interaction of electric and scalar charges accelerated in

four-dimensional space-time. in other words, both were found to be identical functionals of

the source trajectory.

this coincidence, rst, conrms the correctness of the interpretation given in ref. 3 of the

bogolyubov coecient  

 as the source amplitude of a virtual pair of particles potentially

emitted to the right and to the left with the frequencies  and , with the timelike 2-
momentum of the pair (5), the mass m = 2, and a spin equal to 1 for a boson pair and

0 for a fermion pair.

second, it means that the self-interaction of mirror is realized by the creation and ab-

sorption of virtual pairs, rather than individual particles, and is transfered from one point

of the trajectory to another by the causal greens function of the wave equation for four-

dimensional, rather than two-dimensional space-time.

the action integral is formed by virtual pairs with the mass m = 2, which takes

any positive values. therefore, it is natural to expect that the eective propagation function

of such pairs will be the integral of the propagation function of a massive particle in two-

dimensional space-time over the mass m.

at the same time, it can be shown that the causal greens functions for spaces of di-

mensionalities d and d + 2, being functions of the invariant interval s = z2 between two

points and the mass , are related to one another by the equalities

(d+2)

f

(z, ) =

and are expressed in terms of the mcdonald function with the index specied by the dimen-

sionality of the space-time:

(d)

f (z, ) =

i2

(2)+1(is) k(is),

 =

d  2

2

.

(71)

the second equality in (70) for d = 2 conrms the appearance of a causal function

characteristic of four-dimensional space-time as an eective propagation function of virtual

20

pairs with dierent masses m in two-dimensional space-time. now the small mass parameter

, which was introduced in sec. 2 to eliminate the infrared divergence, can be interpreted

as the lower bound of the masses of the virtual pairs transfering the self-interaction of a

mirror.

a virtual pair can not escape to innity, since one of its particles unavoidably undergoes

reection from the mirror, after which the pair becomes real and massless. the emission of

such pairs forms im w . owing to masslessness, the emission of arbitrary large number of

arbitrary soft quanta becomes possible on trajectories with 21 6= 0, i.e., infrared divergence
of im wf appears. by choosing a nonzero, but suciently small value for , we eliminate

the infrared divergence in im wf and make sure that re wf does not depend on  at

  ||. this means that the main contribution to re wf is made by virtual pairs with
a mass of the order of ||.

in the general case, where the mean number of pairs created is not small compared to 1,

the quantity 2 im w is no longer equal to the mean number of pairs tr(+). because of

the interference of two or more being created pairs it equals

2 im w = tr ln(1  +)|f

0 = tr ln(+)|f
0 .

(72)

the last formula prompted de witt15 to consider the following expression for w natural:

w = i tr ln .

(73)

the matrix formulation of the bogolyubov coecients  and  was adopted. in addition,

tr must be replaced by (1/2)tr in the case of an identical particle and antiparticle3.

we do not know of any concrete results for re w emanating from (73).

the symmetry discussed would be total, if the equality e2 = c would hold in heaviside

units.
