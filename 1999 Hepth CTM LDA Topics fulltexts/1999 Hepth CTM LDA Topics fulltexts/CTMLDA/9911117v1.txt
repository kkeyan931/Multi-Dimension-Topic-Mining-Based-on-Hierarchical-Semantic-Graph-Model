we study the eect of the dp-brane gas in string cosmology. when one kind

of dp-brane gas dominates , we nd that the cosmology is equivalent to that

of the brans-dicke theory with the perfect uid type matter. we obtain ,

recent developments of the string theory suggest that in a regime of planck length,

quantum uctuation is very large so that string coupling becomes large and consequently

the fundamental string degrees of freedom are not a weakly coupled good ones [1]. instead,

solitonic degrees of freedom like p-branes or dp-branes [2] are more important. therefore

it is a very interesting question to ask what is the eect of these new degrees of freedom to

the space time structure especially whether including these degrees of freedom resolves the

initial singularity, which is a problem in standard general relativity.

what should be the starting point for the investigation of the p-brane cosmology? it

should be a generalization of general relativity. the brans-dicke theory is a generic defor-

mation of the general relativity allowing variable gravity coupling. in fact the low energy

theory of the fundamental string [3] contains the brans-dicke (bd) theory with a ne tuned

deformation parameter (=-1). moreover du and et al. [4] found that the natural metric

that couples to the p-brane is the einstein metric multiplied by certain power of dilaton

eld. in terms of this new metric, the action that gives the p-brane solution becomes bd

action with denite deformation parameter  depending on p. in our previous papers [5,6],

we have studied this kind of the bd model and found exact solutions depending on two

arbitrary parameters. furthermore, according to the range of parameters involved, we also

have classied all possible behaviors of the bd cosmology and found solutions resolving the

initial singularity problem for some regions [7]. however, it remains an open questions how

to determine the equation of state parameter . in this paper, we will determine  from the

relation between this bd theory and the string theory with dp-brane.

we start with reviewing the bd theory in which the perfect uid type matter is included.

lets assume that our universe is a d dimensional homogeneous isotropic one. the general

bd action is given by

s = z ddxge [r  ] + sm,

(1)

where  is the dilaton eld and sm is the matter part of the action. the equations of motion

of the bd theory become [8,9]

0 = r  22 + ()2.

r is the curvature scalar and cosmological metric is given by

dsd

2 = n dt2 + e2(t)ijdxidxj (i, j = 1, 2,   , d  1),

(2)

(3)

where e(t) is the scale factor and n is a (constant) lapse function. now, we assume that
all variables are the functions of time t only, then the curvature scalar [10] in d dimension

is given by

where

r = g00r00 + gijrij,

whit  = t. with the equation of state p = , the energy-momentum tensor of the
perfect-uid type matter is given by

t = pg + (p + )uu

(6)

where u is the uid velocity. under the hydrostatic equilibrium condition, the energy-

momentum conservation is

 + (d  1)(p + )  = 0.

using p = , we get the solution

 = 0e(d1)(1+).

(7)

(8)

in our previous papers, the parameters  and  were considered as free parameters. in this

paper, however,  will be related to the dimension of the world volume of p-brane.

if we consider only the time dependence, the equations of motion (2) and the energy-

momentum conservation (7) follow from the action

s = z dte(d1)" 1
n {  (d  2)(d  1) 2 + 2(d  1)   +  2}

n 0e(d1)(1+)+ (cid:21) .


now, we introduce a new time variable  by

dt = e(d1)d.

then the action can be written as

s = z d" 1
n (cid:16)(d  2)(d  1)2 + 2(d  1) + 2(cid:17)

n 0e(d1)(1) (cid:21) ,


(9)

(10)

(11)

where prime means the derivative with respect to the new time variable  and 0 is con-

sidered as a positive real constant. note that the variation over the constant lapse function

gives a constraint equation. so far we discussed bd theory.

now we consider the string cosmology by the d-dimensional eective action with n-form

eld strength that is coming from the appropriate compactication of 10-dimensional low

energy eective string theory. in einstein frame, the action reads

s = z ddxqge"r

where  is given by

2(n) = 4 

2(n  1)(n  1)

n + n  2

,

(12)

(13)

with the dual dimension n = d  n. from this action, we can obtain an action in other
frame by a conformal mapping. the p-brane frame is dened by the conformal mapping

gp

(n)

n1 ge

,

(14)

where ge

 (gp

) means the metric in einstein (p-brane) frame. in this p-brane frame [4],

the action is written as

s = z ddxgpe (d2)a(n)

(cid:20)r

2n!

2(cid:21) ,

where  becomes [4]

 = 

(d  1)(n  3)  (n  1)2
(d  2)(n  3)  (n  1)2 .

(15)

(16)

in 4-dimension, the bd parameter  is given by  =  4
3 for the 0-brane (p = 0) and  =  3
for the instanton (p = 1), etc. hence, the bd parameter  can be varied according to
the p-branes included. however, it is not clear whether the matters come from nsp- or

2

dp-branes in p-brane frame.

in string frame, by an appropriate conformal mapping, the action is given by

s = z ddxg"e{r + } 

em

h1nh 1n# .

(17)

notice that the bd parameter  is xed as 1. for m = 1, an n-form eld strength comes
from the compactication of ns-ns 3-form in 10-dimensional theory. m = 0 for n-form

coming from r-r sector. the dual form in ns-ns sector is dened by [4]

 h = eh,

for solitonic nsp-brane, and m = 1 for this case.

under the ansatz,

h1,,n = 

nn1,,n10a(t)

where 1,   , n1 6= 0, then the bianchi identity

[h1,,n] = 0

(18)

(19)

(20)

is always satised, since we assume that a(t) is a function of t only. n should be used for

obtaining the correct constraint equation. in terms of a(t), (t) and (t), the action (17)

for the cosmology becomes

s = z dte(d1)" 1
n {  (d  2)(d  1) 2 + 2(d  1)    2}
n

a2e2(n1)+(m+1) # .

(21)

using the new time variable  dened in (10), the action is given by

s = z d" 1
n (cid:16)(d  2)(d  1)2 + 2(d  1)  2(cid:17)
n

a2e2(n1)+(m+1) # ,

+

2

from this, we can obtain the equations of motion

2(d  1)(d  2)  2(d  1)  (n  1)(a)2e2(n1)+(m+1) = 0,

2(d  1)  2 

(m + 1)

2

(a)2e2(n1)+(m+1) = 0,

 hae2(n1)+(m+1)i = 0,

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

where the lapse function n is set to 1 after calculation. the solution of eq. (25) is given by

a = 2qe2(n1)(m+1),

(26)

with a constant q. substituting this into eq. (23) and (24), the resulting equations of motion

are written as

2(d  1)(d  2)  2(d  1)  2(n  1)q2e2(n1)(m+1) = 0,

2(d  1)  2  (m + 1)q2e2(n1)(m+1) = 0.

these equations of motion can be derived from the following action

s = z d" 1
n (cid:16)(d  2)(d  1)2 + 2(d  1)  2(cid:17)

n q2e2(n1)(m+1) (cid:21) .


(27)

(28)

(29)

comparing this action with that of the bd theory given by eq. (11), the action of the bd

theory is equivalent to that of the string theory with the dp-brane gas (m = 0) if we set
0 = q2 and 2(n  1) = (d  1)(1  ). from these, the bd parameter  is related to p the
spatial dimension of the world volume of p-brane;

5

 =

d  2p  3

d  1

.

(30)

this is the main result of our paper. note that in string frame, the behaviors of the cosmology

depend only on p (= n  2). in the four dimensional space time,  of the instanton gas
(p = 1) is xed to 1 and for the particle (p = 0)  = 1/3 is consistent with the known value
of  for the radiation dominant era. in our previous work [5], the behavior of the scale factor

for general  and  was classied. with the d-particle gas (p = 0 and  = 1/3), the string

cosmology has two phases as fig. 1. for the d-string gas,  = 1/3 which is consistent
with the value of cosmic string gas [11], the behavior of scale factor has two phases as shown

in fig. 2. for d2-brane or d3-brane cases (p = 2 or p = 3), the scale factor behaves as fig.

3.

in this paper, we have shown that the string theory with dp-brane gas can be described

by the bd theory with the perfect uid type matter and the parameter  in bd theory is

determined by the dimension of the brane. in string theory with the ns- (m = 1) or the
dual ns-brane (m = 1) gas, the matter couples to the dilaton, and the energy-momentum

of the perfect uid is not conserved due to this coupling. hence we can not consider the ns

type brane gas as a perfect uid. to describe the ns brane gas as the perfect uid, we have

to study the string theory in a frame where the dilaton does not couple with the the brane.

details will be discussed in later work [12].
