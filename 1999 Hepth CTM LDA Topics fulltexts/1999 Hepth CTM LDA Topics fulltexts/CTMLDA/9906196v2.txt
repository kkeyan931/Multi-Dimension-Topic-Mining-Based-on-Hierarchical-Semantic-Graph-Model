abstract

we nd the absorption probability of dilaton eld in type 0b string theory.
since the background solutions are of the form ads5  s5 on both regions,
we use the semiclassical formalism adopted in type iib theory to nd the
absorption cross section. the background tachyon eld solution was used
as a reference to relate the solutions of the two regions. we also consider
the possible corrections to absorption probability and the ln(ln z) form of the
correction is expected as in the calculation of the connement solution.

i. introduction

maldecenas conjecture that n = 4 super yang-mills theory is dual to type iib super-
gravity has opened a new horizon to the study of large n qcd [1]. another possibility
to apply this technique to non supersymmetric gauge theories was proposed by polyakov
[2]. he suggested that one can study non-susy gauge theories using branes in the con-
text of type 0 string theories. the type 0 string theories are dened on the world sheet of
type ii by performing a non-chiral gso projection [3]. as a consequence type 0 theories
have world sheet supersymmetry but no space-time supersymmetry. the resulting sectors
of the theories are, in the notation of [4], (ns, ns), (ns+, ns+) and a doubled set of
ramond-ramond elds. if the doubled r-r is (r+, r), (r, r+), the theory is type 0a
and if (r+, r+), (r, r), the theory is 0b. these non-susy string theories are also part
of the web of dualities and can be described as limits of m-theory. it is known that the type
0a corresponds to m-theory on s1/(1)fs  s, where s denotes a half-shift along the circle,
and type 0b corresponds to m-theory on t2/(1)fs  s, where s is along the circle of the
torus [5].
the low energy elds of the theory are tachyon, the bosonic eld of type ii and two
copies of r-r elds. accordingly they have open string descendants which are crucial for
the d-brane construction. following the idea of [2], klebanov and tseytlin [6] sought the
possibility that the tachyonic instability can be cured by the r-r elds. using the near-
horizon threebrane geometry they constructed an su(n) gauge theory with six adjoint
scalars and studied its behavior in the point of ads/cft correspondence. the tachyon
indeed condensed with its eective mass squared being shifted to a positive value. the
analysis showed that the tachyon is constant at large radial distance and the geometry is of
the form ads5  s5 with vanishing coupling, which can be interpreted as a uv xed point.
the condensation breaks the conformal invariance which agrees with the fact that the dual
gauge theory is not conformal. the asymptotic solution for weak coupling was found by
minahan [7] and revealed that the logarithmic ow as expected from the asymptotic freedom
of the dual gauge theory. also the solution has the right sign of the -function in agreement
with eld theory and there exists another xed point at innite coupling(ir xed point),
which is also characterized by ads5  s5 einstein frame metric.
it is argued that there
is an rg trajectory that extends from uv xed point to the ir xed point [8,9]. the
generic static solution to type 0 gravity equations of motions are conning in the ir and
have logarithmic scaling in the uv.

the construction of non-susy branes suggests many directions of research. and it
seems that many of the results which were obtained in type ii brane congurations can be
copied in the type 0 case. since the metric solutions are asymptotically ads5  s5 for both
regions, the study of scattering process can be one of the examples. scattering amplitude or
absorption cross section involving the tachyon eld cannot be addressed from the previous
work on type ii theories [10,11]. however one can use the same technique as in type ii
theories to evaluate various scattering with d-branes in type 0 theories. the purpose of this
paper is to seek this possibility. specically, we will consider the semiclassical low energy
scattering of dilaton under the static background solution of type 0b string theory and nd
the absorption cross section.

the organization of the paper is as follows. in section ii we review the type 0b theory and

2

its background solutions of both regions and set up some preliminaries for our calculation.
in section iii we nd the leading absorption cross section in the low-frequency limit. we
use the background tachyon eld as a reference to relate the solutions of both regions. in
section iv we consider the higher order corrections to the absorption probability. two kinds
of orrections are possible, one from the background metric and the other from the string
coupling through the tachyon eld. section v is devoted to conclusions.

ii. type 0b background spacetime

the type 0 model has a closed string tachyon, no fermions and a doubled set of r-r
elds, and thus a doubled set of d-branes [12]. with the doubling of r-r elds, the self-
dual constraint on the ve-form eld is relaxed and one can have d3 branes that are electric
instead of dyonic. we consider the low energy world volume action of n coincident electric
d3 branes. we start from the action for the type 0b theory [8]

in the einstein frame the dilaton decouples from the r-r terms (|f5|2) and the tachyon
mass term plays the role of the source term. it is easy to analyze the case where the |f5|2
is large in (5). assuming that the tachyon is localized near the extremum of f (t ), i.e.

(20)

the corrections cause the eective radius of ads5 to become smaller than that of s5. one
can nd the asymptotic freedom from the large u behavior of the leading eective gravity
solution. it is an important question whether it survives the full string theoretic treatment.
it has been argued [8] that the solution does survive due to the special structure related
to the approximate conformal invariance. the crucial fact is that the einstein metric is
asymptotic to ads5  s5. this geometry is is conformal to at space, so that the weyl
tensor vanishes in the large u limit. furthermore, both  and t vary slowly for large u.
one interesting feature of the tachyon rg trajectory is that t starts increasing from its
critical value t = 1 from condition f (t ) = 0. the precise form of the trajectory for nite
 is not known analytically, but the qualitative feature of the rg equation was analyzed
by klebanov and tseytlin [8,13]. since ,  and  have negative second derivatives (see
equations (10) (12)), each of these elds may reach a maximum at some value of . if,
for , this happens at nite , then the coupling decreases far in the infrared. as a result,
 is positive for all , asymptotically vanishing as
a dierent possibility can be realized:
  . they constructed the asymptotic form of such trajectory. the point is that, as
2  becomes small. for this
  , t approaches zero so that, as in the uv region, t 2e
reason the limiting einstein-frame metric is again ads5  s5. thus, the theory ows to a
conformally invariant point at innite coupling. the explicit form of the asymptotic large 
solution (ir solution) is

the metric starts again as ads5  s5 (y = 4 ln u) at y =  and becomes a negative
curvature 10-d space at smaller y (bigger u). as in the large u region, the corrections cause
the eective radius of ads5 to become smaller than that of s5.

the structure of the asymptotic uv and ir solutions is similar, suggesting that they
can be smoothly connected into the full interpolating solution. for example, the tachyon
starts at t = 1 at  = 0, and grows according to (15), then enters an oscillating regime
and nally relaxes to zero according to (21). note that the coordinates corresponding to
the two regions are related by y  y.

iii. semiclassical absorption of dilaton

if we consider the solution found in section ii as a static background solution, one can
think the low energy scattering of string elds. since the metric solutions are asymptotically
ads5  s5 in both regions, we can use the semiclassical formalism of type ii theories. for
simplicity of calculation we will consider scattering of low energy dilaton eld in the type
0b string backgrounds. to study the scattering problem, we introduce the time-dependent
perturbed eld of dilaton

 = (y) + (y, t).

(26)

we look for the solutions to the equation of motion for a mode of frequency  of the dilaton
(y, t) = (y)eit. then the linearized equation of motion governing the perturbation of the
dilaton is

(27)

we will consider the solution in the uv region rst. to nd the leading order solution in

in the ir region, we can also neglect the last term since t  0 in the leading order and the
solution is given by the bessel functions

where the rst term corresponds to the normalizable mode and the second to nonnormaliz-
able mode. we choose  = 0 for the solution to be nite as   , then

(39)

to relate the solution in the uv region and ir region, we adopt the matching scheme
similar to the cases of d3-brane and m5-branes [10] and d1-d5 brane system [11]. for both
cases the equation of motion for the minimal scalar has a self-dual point dened by the
radius of the eective anti-de sitter space. in our case we have to be careful in choosing the
matching point because the eective radii of the anti-de sitter space for both regions are
dierent because of the tachyon coupling. so we choose the matching point from the point
where the background tachyon eld has the same values at the leading order. equating (15)
and (21) in the leading order, 1 + 8/y = 16/y, we have y = 24 as the matching point. in
terms , this corresponds that we match the asymptotic solution of the uv region, which
is valid for very small , at  = e24 and that of the ir region, valid for very large , at
 = e24. matching the amplitude of  at the leading order

iv. higher order corrections

in this section we will consider the eect of higher order corrections of the dilaton ab-
sorption cross-section. the dominant corrections to absorption cross-section arise from the
matching about the point where the tachyon eld have the same value.
in the case of
d3-brane and m5-brane of type iib theory the correction to the minimally coupled scalar
equation is done by considering the higher order terms of the background metric. however,
in our case where the dilaton is coupled to the tachyon through the string coupling , we
have to consider the correction by this coupling term too. for simplicity of the calculation
we consider only the leading terms and subleading corrections will be straightforward.

in the low energy scattering case the terms on the right hand side act as small perturbations.
the rst term on the right hand side is due to metric correction while the second is from

leading correction is of the form ln(ln z) from the integral structure

z z dx

x

xn
ln x

= zn ln(ln z) +    .

however, if we retain only the leading terms of the the series expansion of bessel functions

j2(x) =

x2
8

, y2(x) = 

4
x2 , h (2)

2 (x) =

4i
z2 ,

the correction terms from this type cancels out. the correction of the relative coecient 
is from the subleading terms i.e. next order terms of bessel functions and    of (55) and
(58). this is a good consistency check for the background solutions.

v. discussion

we considered the low energy scattering of dilaton eld in the type 0b theory. using the
fact that the asymptotic structure of the background solutions on both regions is ads5 s5,
we calculated semiclassically the absorption probability. since the tachyonic coupling term
is small on both regions, the calculation is similar to the case of minimally coupled scalar
of type ii theory. a crucial role in our formalism was played by the background tachyon
eld. we used it as a reference to nd the matching point. we also considered the possible
corrections of absorption probability and the ln(ln z) form of the correction [7,8] is expected
as in the calculation of the connement solution.

in the present paper, we perturbed only the dilaton eld from the background for sim-
plicity of calculation. the right way to analyze the scattering is to perturb all elds in the
theory and solve the full coupled equations, which seems very dicult to solve. we con-
sidered the low energy world volume action of n coincident electric d3 branes. we expect
that the same formalism can be applied to self-dual 3-branes [13] because the asymptotic
structure of the background also has ads5  s5 structure. though we considered only the
case of d = 10 critical case, it seems interesting to study the case of non critical type 0
theory in lower dimensions [15].
