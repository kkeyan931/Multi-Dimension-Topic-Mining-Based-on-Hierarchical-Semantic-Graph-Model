abstract

we obtain new solutions where a string and a pp-wave lie in the common worldvolume

directions of the non-standard intersection of two gauge 5-branes in the heterotic string. the

two 5-branes are supported by independent su (2) yang-mills instantons in their respective

(non-overlapping) transverse spaces. we present a detailed study of the unbroken supersym-

metry, focusing especially on a comparison between a direct construction of killing spinors

and a counting of zero eigenvalues in the annticommutator of supercharges. the results are

in agreement with some previous arguments, to the eect that additional zero eigenvalues

resulting from a ne-tuning between positive-energy and negative-energy contributions

from dierent components in an intersection are spurious, and should not be taken as an

indication of supersymmetry enhancements. these observations have a general applicability

that goes beyond the specic example we study in this paper.

introduction

over the years, a large menagerie of bps p-brane solutions of the various supergravities has

been discovered. these include the basic half-supersymmetric solutions such as the string

[1] and 5-brane [2] in d = 10, and the membrane [3] and 5-brane [4] in d = 11. in addition,

there are bps solutions that preserve smaller fractions of supersymmetry, which admit an

interpretation as intersections [5] of the basic half-supersymmetric building blocks.

the intersections themselves can be divided into two broad categories. firstly, there are

the standard intersections, which can all be interpreted, by means of a toroidal reduction

to some suciently low dimension, as multi-charge p-branes for some single specic p,

where the charges are carried by dierent eld strengths of the lower-dimensional theory.

the p-brane for each charge species by itself oxidises back to one specic component of the

intersection in the higher dimension, with the full set of intersecting objects arising when all

the dierent charge species are turned on. this draws attention to the fact that one should

also include bps congurations that go somewhat beyond what one would normally call a

p-brane. if the charge-carrying eld in the lower dimension is a kaluza-klein vector, then

back in the original higher dimension it will have become part of the o-diagonal structure

of the internal part of the metric.

if the kaluza-klein vector carried an electric charge

in the lower dimension, this will give rise to a higher-dimensional metric with a pp-wave

propagating along one of the internal directions. if, on the other hand, the kaluza-klein

eld carried a magnetic charge in the lower dimension, then, from the higher-dimensional

standpoint, the metric will have a taub-nut-like monopole structure, sometimes simply

called a nut for short. various p-brane examples can be found in [6] and references

therein. four-dimensional black hole solutions were classied in [7]. the intersection rules

for p-branes in d = 11 and d = 10 were classied in [8]. the classication of p-branes and

standard intersections in maximal supergravities for 2  d  11 was given in [10, 11].

the second category of intersecting solutions consists of what may be called non-

standard intersections. these are examples where there is no simple lower-dimensional

interpretation as a multi-charge p-brane. this is because in these solutions the harmonic

functions for the intersecting ingredients are all independent of the overall transverse space.

the rst such example was constructed in [12], and further examples were studied in [13, 14,

8, 9]. a four-dimensional solution with three perpendicular intersecting membranes (domain

walls in d = 4) was constructed in [15], admitting an interpretation as a cosmological lattice

universe model. in fact three is the maximal number of intersections (with all pair-wise

intersections non-standard) that can occur in supergravity theories. the solutions that we

1

shall be constructing in this paper involve a combination of standard and non-standard

intersections.

intersections in d = 10 can arise in both the type ii theories and also in the heterotic

theory. many of the solutions in the heterotic theory can also be viewed as solutions in the

type ii theories, since the subset of the latter that make use only of the ns-ns elds can

be transferred across directly as solutions in the heterotic string. however, there are also

further possibilities in the heterotic string, owing to the presence of the yang-mills elds.

one possibility is to nd solutions in which the yang-mills elds themselves carry charges

that play a role in supporting the p-brane or intersection. however, in such circumstances

one typically nds that the solution will not be a bps one. another possibility is to use the

yang-mills elds to construct an instanton conguration in a four-dimensional transverse

space, which can act as a non-singular source in place of the more customary point-charge

singular sources in the harmonic functions describing the solution. one can think of the

yang-mills elds here as playing the role of a regulator, which smears out the point-

charge singularities. the rst example of such an instanton-supported soliton was the

gauge 5-brane constructed in [2]. a dyonic string in d = 6, where both the electric and

magnetic charges are supported by yang-mills instantons, was constructed in [16]. such a

conguration can also support a pp-wave propagating in the string world sheet [17].

the new solutions that we shall construct in this paper involve many of the ingredients

mentioned above. specically, what we obtain is a ten-dimensional solution of the heterotic

theory, describing the intersection of two 5-branes, a string, and a pp-wave. if the 5-brane

charges are turned o, the string/wave intersection is of the standard type, which can be

viewed as a 2-charge black hole in d = 9, supported by the winding vector and the kaluza-

klein vector respectively. we shall rst obtain the more general intersections, with the two

5-branes, a string and a pp-wave, as solutions using only the elds of the n = 1 truncation

of type ii supergravities; in other words the metric, the 2-form potential and the dilaton.

as usual in such solutions, there will be singular sources, corresponding to the locations of

point charges or distributions of charges. then, we shall show that we can generalise the

solutions by using the yang-mills elds of the heterotic string to smear out the two sets

of 5-brane charges. a novel feature, associated with the fact that the intersection between

the two 5-branes is non-standard, is that we can introduce separate self-dual yang-mills

instanton congurations in the two distinct transverse 4-spaces of the two 5-branes.

having obtained the intersecting solutions, we then turn to a detailed discussion of their

supersymmetry. there has been a rather confusing literature on the subject of the super-

2

symmetry of multi-charge p-branes, and intersecting p-branes, and in the present paper we

attempt to clarify some of these issues. although our discussion will be focused on the par-

ticular case of interest here, it actually provides insights of a more widespread applicability.

we shall be particularly concerned with addressing the issue of how one should interpret

the occurrence of zero-eigenvalues of the matrix {q, q} obtained by anticommuting the

supercharges, and to what extent such zero eigenvalues can be taken as an indication of

the corresponding existence of killing spinors. in particular, when one calculates {q, q}

for bps congurations involving more than one kind of charge species, one commonly nds

that the number of zero-eigenvalues can become enhanced for particular ne tunings of

the charges, by cancelling one contribution against another.1 this would appear to imply

that the supersymmetry can be enhanced at these special charge values, leading even to

preserved supersymmetry fractions such as 3

8 in some cases. examples of this apparent
phenomenon were found [18] and subsequently laid to rest [19] in the past. in this paper

4 or 7

we examine the issue in the context of the new intersections of two 5-branes, a string and

a pp-wave that we obtain here. we compare the results from the {q, q} anticommutator

with the results of direct computation of the killing spinors, and we conclude again that

the apparent supersymmetry enhancements suggested by the enlarged numbers of {q, q}

zero-eigenvalues at special charge values are spurious. the point is that the derivation of the

connection between zero-eigenvalues of {q, q} and the existence of killing spinors involves

certain assumptions about the global structure of the solutions, including the absence of

naked singularities in the metric, and these assumptions are violated in all the cases where

ne-tuning of charge parameters enlarges the number of zero-eigenvalues. (some detailed

discussion of this point was given in [21].) thus our results here support the previous con-

tention that no enhancements of supersymmetry occur at ne-tuned non-vanishing charge

values.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we construct the new solutions, com-

prising a non-standard intersection of two 5-branes together with a string and a pp-wave,

within the framework of the n = 1 truncation of type ii supergravity. all the ingredients,

including the 5-branes, have singular sources. then, in section 3, we generalise the solutions

within the framework of the heterotic theory, by introducing self-dual yang-mills instantons

to replace the singular 5-brane sources. in section 4 we examine the supersymmetry of the

solutions, both from the type iia or m-theoretic viewpoint and from the heterotic view-

point. we show how the explicit results from solving the killing-spinor equations compare

1as opposed to setting charges to zero, which obviously can enlarge the supersymmetry.

3

with a counting of zero-eigenvalues in the anticommutator of supercharges, which clari-

es the issue of when the zero-eigenvalue counting procedure gives trustworthy results for

the determination of unbroken supersymmetry. in section 5, we discuss the near-horizon

structure of the intersecting solutions. the paper ends with conclusions in section 6.

2

intersections with singular sources

in this section, we construct the new solution, which is a non-standard intersection of two

5-branes, a string and a pp-wave, within the framework of the n = 1 truncation of the

type ii strings. specically, it is a solution of the theory described by the ten-dimensional

lagrangian

and is given by

l10 = r1l  1

2 e f(3)  f(3) ,

f(3) =  e (eh dt  dx  d4z  dh 1) +  e (h dt  dx  d4y  deh 1)

+e dt  dx  dk 1 ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

where h = h(~y ), eh = eh(~z ), k = k(~y, ~z ) and w = w (~y, ~z ), and the ten coordinates

have been split as (t, x, ~y, ~z ) with ~y = (y1, y2, y3, y4) and ~z = (z1, z2, z3, z4). the quantities

 , e and w can each independently be chosen to be 1, giving a total of 16 equivalent
solutions.2

we nd that equations (2.2) give a solution provided that the functions h and eh

are harmonic with respect to the at spaces corresponding to their indicated coordinate

dependences,

while he and w satisfy the equations

~y h = 0 ,

~z eh = 0 ,

(2.3)

h 1

~y k + eh 1

~z k = 0 ,

h 1

~z w = 0 .

(2.4)

~y w + eh 1

2these 16 solutions are all equivalent purely within the framework of the bosonic sector of the super-

gravity, but they are not all equivalent when supersymmetry is taken into account. this is because eld

strengths enter quadratically in the bosonic equations, but linearly in the supersymmetry transformation

rules.

4

k is associated with the string, and w with the pp-wave. since there is no overlap be-

the harmonic functions h and eh are associated with the two 5-branes in the intersection,
tween the coordinate dependences of the h and eh harmonic functions, it is evident that

the intersection is of a non-standard type, since there is no lower dimension where the con-

guration could become a multi-charge p-brane. furthermore, the functions k and w do

not simply satisfy laplace equations, but instead satisfy coupled equations that involve the

5-brane harmonic functions h and eh. this also is a characteristic feature of non-standard

intersections. of course, we can nd simple solutions for k and w by taking

k(~y, ~z ) = 1(~y ) 2(~z ) + 3(~y ) + 4(~z ) ,

w (~y, ~z ) = 1(~y ) 2(~z ) + 3(~y ) + 4(~z ) ,

(2.5)

where the functions i and i are all harmonic in their respective subspaces. note that

solutions of this kind, but without the wave component (i.e. with w = 1), were obtained

previously in [22]. the solution can also be obtained from the dimensional reduction of the

intersections of a wave, an m2-brane and two m5-branes in d=11, which were constructed

in [23].

it is worth remarking that since the lagrangian (2.1) can also be viewed as a consistent

truncation of the type iia theory, we can also regard the above solutions as originating

from d = 11. in fact we shall exploit this later, when we calculate the supersymmetry of

the solutions.

3

instanton-supported intersections

we shall now show that we can generalise the above intersection, by using the yang-mills

elds of the heterotic string to provide instanton congurations that will allow the harmonic

functions h and eh associated with the 5-branes to be replaced by non-singular solutions in

the heterotic string. a novel feature that arises here is that, owing to the non-overlapping

nature of the 4-dimensional subspaces coordinatised by ~y and ~z, where the functions h(~y )

and eh(~z ) nd their support, we can introduce independent yang-mills instantons for the

two 5-branes, using separate su (2) factors in the e8  e8 or so(32) gauge group.

the low-energy eective action of the heterotic string is n = 1 supergravity in d = 10,

coupled to e8  e8 or so(32) yang-mills matter elds. we shall focus on two orthogonal

su (2) subgroups of e8  e8. the lagrangian for the bosonic sector is given by

we nd that the lagrangian (3.1) admits solutions of precisely the same form (2.2) as

equations can be satised by taking the yang-mills elds to be either self-dual or anti-self-

dual (with independent such choices for the two su (2) factors). as with the signs in the

expression for the 3-form eld strength in (2.2), the dierent choices that one makes can

impinge upon the supersymmetry of the solutions, as we shall see later.

the equations for k and w depend on h and eh.

solutions where k and w are independent of h and eh. thus, as in (2.5), we may simply

take solutions for k and w built from harmonic functions in the two subspaces:

in this paper, we shall focus on

each type of index , , etc. . likewise, the quantities q

sets of charges at the dierent sets of locations.

the equations for the 5-brane functions h and eh have yang-mills source terms. we shall

consider the situation where the source in each equation is an su (2) yang-mills instanton

(using a dierent su (2) subgroup for each equation). the use of single-charge and certain

classes of multi-charge su (2) instanton solutions as sources for the 5-brane were discussed

in [16, 17]. we have

(3.7)

as discussed in [17], the nal terms in these expressions for h and eh serve the purpose of
subtracting out singular-source contributions to the functions h and eh. clearly, one can
~y h = 0 and ~z eh = 0

always add in any harmonic solution of the homogeneous equations

to the solutions of the inhomogeneous equations given in (3.5). however, we are interested

in the case where the sources are entirely non-singular, coming only from the yang-mills

instantons. it turns out that the terms involving the logarithms in (3.7) actually include

in precisely to subtract these out.

singular-source contributions, and the nal terms in the expressions for h and eh are put
thus, as discussed in [17], the functions h and eh given in (3.7) satisfy the equations of

motion throughout the space with no singularities. there are two types of phase transition

that can occur in certain limits of the instanton moduli, i.e. the instanton sizes and their

relative locations. if the size of an instanton shrinks to zero, the associated h function be-

comes harmonic, with a delta-function singularity at the location of the instanton, implying

that a point-like fundamental 5-brane is created [17]. the second type of phase transition

occurs if two instantons coalesce, leading to the creation of a point-like fundamental 5-brane

[17]. as we shall see later, the vanishing of the instanton degrees of freedom, and hence the

creation of the fundamental 5-brane, turns the null area of the horizon to a non-vanishing

one.

7

4 supersymmetry

to begin, we shall consider the situation where we take the scale sizes of the yang-mills

instantons to zero, so that the function h and eh become harmonic, satisfying (2.3). having

studied the supersymmetry in the framework of type iia supergravity and m-theory, and

then in the heterotic framework, we shall then consider the situation when the yang-mills

instantons replace the singular sources for the 5-branes. we shall see that the preserved

supersymmetry will be the same whether or not the vanishing-instanton limit is taken.

4.1 m-theory perspective

when the yang-mills instanton scales are both set to zero, the solution in the heterotic

theory can be embedded into type iia supergravity, and hence into m-theory. we shall

make use of this in order to calculate the explicit conditions for the existence of killing

spinors, by viewing the conguration as a solution in d = 11. then, we shall compare

these explicit results with what one learns by studying the matrix of anticommutators

of supercharges. this latter method can be a useful tool for determining the fraction of

unbroken supersymmetry, although as we shall see, the results that come from it must be

interpreted with care. specically, it can sometimes give a false indication of enhanced

supersymmetry for special values of the charges, but these always turn out to be spurious,

being associated with congurations with negative-mass contributions in the metric and

naked singularities. (similar issues were discussed previously in [19].)

4.1.1 killing spinor construction

we may view the conguration comprising the intersection of the two 5-branes, string and

a pp-wave as a solution of d = 11 supergravity. to do this, we oxidise from d = 10 type

iia to d = 11 using the standard kaluza-klein rules:

ds2

6  ds2

11 = e 1
f(4) = f(4) + f(3)  (d + a(1)) .

10 + e

3  (d + a(1))2 ,

4

thus we nd that the solution in d = 11 is given by

ds2

11 = k  2

(4.2)

where y and z denote the hodge duals in the four-dimensional y and z subspaces, in
the metrics dyi dyi and dzm dzm respectively. note that here the solution describes a non-

standard intersection of two 5-branes, a membrane, and a pp-wave. we have made the

specic choice of the solution where all four  sign parameters in (2.2) are taken to be +1.

we shall discuss the eects of including the  parameters later.

to solve for the killing spinors, it is useful rst to calculate the spin connection for the

class of metrics

ds2

taking the natural orthonormal basis e0 = ea dt, e9 = w ea (dx + (w 1  1) dt) (where we
choose to take x0 = t and x9 = x); ei = eb dyi, em = ec dzm; and e# = ef d. (there

should be no confusion between vielbeins and exponentials! note that #, pronounced ten,

denotes the vielbein component in the extra dimension.) we nd that the spin connection

is

the supersymmetry transformations in d = 11 are given by

consider rst the a = 0 vielbein components of this equation. substituting the eleven-

from this, we see that we shall have solutions of 0 = 0 if 0 = 0, and the following

conditions hold:

(i + 1

6 ijk jk#)  = 0 ,

(m + 1

6 mnpq npq#)  = 0 ,

(0 + 9#)  = 0 ,

(0 + 9)  = 0 .

(4.7)

in (4.6), while the last two conditions come respectively from the coecients of (ik, mk)

note that the rst two conditions come respectively from the coecients of ih and m eh
and (iw, mw ). thus if any of the functions h, eh, k or w is trivial (i.e. equal to 1),

then the associated condition in (4.7) will be absent. note also that in deriving separate

conditions associated with each function, we have implicitly assumed that the functions are

independent (i.e. not proportional to one another).

proceeding with the a = 9, i, m and  components of a in a similar fashion, we nd

that the conditions for the existence of killing spinors are just precisely those already found

in (4.7), together with

where 0 is a constant spinor.

(4.8)

if we take the indices i and m in the ~y and ~z spaces to range over the values (1, 2, 3, 4)

and (5, 6, 7, 8) respectively, it follows from (4.7) that the conditions for the existence of

killing spinors are that the constant spinor 0 must satisfy

h :

eh :

k :

0 = 1234# 0 ,

0 = 5678# 0 ,

0 = 09# 0 ,

w :

0 = 09 0 ,

(4.9)

where we have made explicit which condition is associated with which metric function.

any one of the four equations in (4.9) by itself has 16 independent solutions for 0.

thus with just one of the four charges turned on, the solution preserves 1

2 of the eleven-
dimensional supersymmetry. the number of solutions that one gets when more charges are

turned on depends on various factors, including ones choice of gamma-matrix conventions.

in particular, one should bear in mind that the product 0123456789# must be either +1l or

1l. if we make the convention choice

0123456789# = +1l ,

(4.10)

then we nd, for example, that the conditions from h and from eh are equivalent, and so
introducing the charge for eh as well as for h would yield no further constraints. on the

10

other hand, if the opposite gamma-matrix convention to (4.10) were chosen, then intro-

ducing eh as well as h would cause all killing spinors to be lost. we shall not enumerate

here all the supersymmetry fractions for the various possible non-vanishing sets of charges,

since the results can be summarised more succinctly later. let us just remark for now that

with optimally-chosen conventions, one nds that the solution with all four charges active
preserves 1

8 of the supersymmetry.

we observed in section 2 that there are actually 16 independent solutions to the bosonic

equations of motion that follow from (2.1), where we allow the independent choice of +1

or 1 for each of the parameters , , e and w in (2.2). thus our specic choice in

(4.2) corresponds to (, , e, w) = (+1, +1, +1, +1). it is clear that when we reinstate the

parameters, the conditions (4.9) will be replaced by

h :

eh :

k :

0 =  1234# 0 ,

0 =  5678# 0 ,

0 = e 09# 0 ,

w :

0 = w 09 0 .

(4.11)

we shall return to a discussion of the possible sign choices later.

note that using (4.10), we can replace the gamma-matrix combinations 1234# and

5678# in (4.11) by 056789 and 012349 respectively. this then means that the indices on

the rst three gamma-matrix combinations in (4.11) can be viewed as lying in the world-

volumes of the two 5-branes and the membrane respectively. the last combination, for w ,

lies in the plane in which the pp-wave propagates.

4.1.2 superalgebra analysis

it is now instructive to compare the explicit results that we have obtained for the killing

spinors with what one learns from the eleven-dimensional supersymmetry algebra. we shall

follow some of the notation and conventions of [20]. one nds that the anticommutator of

the supercharges q gives the expression

{q, q} = c (m pm + 1

2! m1m2 zm1m2 + 1

5! m1m5 zm1m5) ,

(4.12)

where c is the charge-conjugation matrix, which can be taken to be c = 0, and zm1m2 and
zm1m5 are 2-form and 5-form charges. in the present case, where we have two 5-branes

and a membrane supported by f(4) in d = 11, the charges will be given by the asymptotic

integrals of the three terms in f(4) given in (4.2). let us call the 5-brane and membrane

11

charges q5, q5 and q2 respectively. thus we will have non-zero zs given by

z12349 = q5 ,

z56789 = q5 ,

z9# = q2 .

(4.13)

in addition, the pp-wave will contribute to the momentum pm in its direction of propaga-

tion, and so

p9 = qw .

(4.14)

we may choose a basis for the eleven-dimensional gamma matrices where

012349 = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)  1l4 ,

056789 = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)  1l4 ,

(4.15)

09# = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)  1l4 ,

09 = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)  1l4 ,

since 012349, 056789, 09# and 09 all commute with one another. we therefore nd that

{q, q} = diag(e q5  q5q2qw, e q5  q5q2+qw, e q5 + q5+q2+qw,

e q5+ q5+q2qw, e +q5  q5+q2+qw, e +q5  q5+q2qw,

e +q5+ q5q2qw, e +q5 + q5q2qw)1l4 .

(4.16)

where the total energy e is given by

e = p5 + p5 + p2 + pw .

(4.17)

the quantities p5, p5, p2 and pw are the individual contributions to the adm mass coming

from the two 5-branes, the membrane and the pp-wave. they correspond directly to the

overall asymptotic coecients of leading-order inverse power-law coordinate dependences

of the four metric functions h, eh, k and w . the corresponding charges q5, q5, q2 and qw

are related to them by

(q5, q5, q2, qw) = ( p5,  p5, e p2, w pw) ,

(4.18)

where (, , e, w) are the 16  sign choices in the bosonic solutions that we discussed

previously.

consider rst the case where (, , e, w) = (+1, +1, +1, +1). we then nd that the

anticommutator (4.16) is given by

{q, q} = 2 diag(0, pw, p5 + p2 + pw, p5 + p2, p5 + p2 + pw, p5 + p2, p5 + p5, p5 + p5 + pw)  1l4 .

(4.19)

12

clearly in general, namely with all four parameters non-zero, this will have just 4 zero
eigenvalues, giving a counting of 1

8 unbroken supersymmetry that is in precise agreement
with our ndings from the explicit solutions for the killing spinors. for the various possi-

ble combinations of non-vanishing subsets of parameters (p5, p5, p2, pw), the corresponding

numbers of zero eigenvalues in (4.19) can be read o. in each case it is easy to verify that

the counting agrees precisely with our previous derivation of the constraint equations (4.9)

for the killing spinors, provided that, as usual, the spurious zero eigenvalues that could

apparently be achieved by allowing negative p parameters are discarded.

for a total of 8 of the 16 possible sign choices in (4.18), the story is similar.

it is

best summarised by discussing the eigenvalues of {q, q}, rather than keeping track of the

ordering of diagonal entries, which are permuted around in the various cases. thus we may

say that for 8 of the sign choices, we obtain the eigenvalues

 = 2(0, p5 + p2, p5 + p2, p5 + p5, pw, p5 + p2 + pw, p5 + p2 + pw, p5 + p5 + pw) ,

(4.20)

each occurring with degeneracy 4. (this is the same as the set of eigenvalues in the specic

example (4.19).) for these supersymmetric solutions, the mass/charge relations are given

by

e  p5 + p5 + p2 + pw = q2  (q5 + q5)  qw ,

or

 q2  (q5  q5)  qw .

(4.21)

for the remaining 8 possibilities, the eigenvalues are given by

2(p2, p5, p5, p5 + p5 + p2, p2 + pw, p5 + pw, p5 + pw, p5 + p5 + p2 + pw) ,

(4.22)

and hence these solutions break all the supersymmetry if all the charges are non-vanishing.

for these non-supersymmetric solutions the mass/charge relations are given by

e  p5 + p5 + p2 + pw = q2  (q5  q5)  qw ,

or

 q2  (q5 + q5)  qw .

(4.23)

naively, it might seem that we could achieve dierent, sometimes unusual, fractions of

unbroken supersymmetry by making certain special non-vanishing choices for the (p5, p5, p2, pw)

parameters. for example, choosing p5 = p5 = p2, with pw = 0, in (4.20), we could appar-
ently get 24 zero eigenvalues and hence 3

4 preserved supersymmetry. on the other hand,
we saw no indication at all from the explicit solutions for the killing spinors that such

supersymmetry enhancements could occur at special values of the charges.3

3we did remark at the stage when we obtained the conditions (4.7) for the existence of killing spinors

that we were assuming that the functions h, eh, k and w were not proportional to one another.

crucial to appreciate that the quantities p5, p5, p2 and pw are precisely the coecients appearing in these

it is

functions, and so there can be no possibility of two of the functions being proportional in the kinds of cases

we are considering here, where one of their p coecients is the negative of the other.

13

the resolution to this puzzle, as discussed in [19, 21], is that the occurrence of zero

eigenvalues in the anticommutator of supercharges can sometimes give a false impression of

the existence of additional killing spinors, and here we have encountered precisely such an

example. the reason why the supercharge argument is unreliable here is that in order to

achieve the extra zeroes in (4.19) it was necessary to have at least one of the contributions

(p5, p5, p2, pw) that appear in the energy (4.17) be negative. this means that the associated

harmonic function will have a negative asymptotic coecient, and hence it means that there

will be a naked singularity in the metric in some region. under such circumstances, the

assumed conditions under which one derives a relation between zeroes of the anticommutator

(4.12) and unbroken supersymmetry generators are violated, and so one cannot trust the

result. the fact that no additional killing spinors actually arise, as seen from our earlier

explicit calculation, shows that this is indeed what has happened in this case.

4.2 heterotic theory perspective

to study the fractions of preserved supersymmetry in the heterotic theory, we can use

the same killing-spinor calculations as we did before, but now we impose the additional

ten-dimensional chirality condition on the killing spinor,

0 = # 0 .

(4.24)

(of course we might instead impose this condition with a minus sign, depending on our

conventions.) thus the number of independent components of unbroken supersymmetry

is determined by solving the equations (4.9), together with (4.24). as usual, if any of the

charges in (4.9) is zero, then the associated condition is omitted. rather than stating the

results for the various supersymmetry fractions here, it is more convenient rst to give

the discussion of the anticommutator of supercharges in this heterotic case. as in the

previous m-theory discussion, we again nd that the two approaches agree, provided that

we discard any apparent supersymmetry enhancements that would naively appear to occur

in the {q, q} eigenvalue calculation when there are negative energy contributions.

since we are not for now concerned with the contributions of the yang-mills elds in

the anticommutator algebra {q, q}, we can make use of the same formalism (4.12) as in

d = 11, but with the additional requirement that we should project all matrices onto the

positive eigenspace of the chirality operator #. from (4.15), we see that in the gamma

matrix conventions we are using here # will be given by

# = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)  1l4 .

(4.25)

14

the projection onto the positive eigenspace of # therefore amounts to keeping only the

1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th entries in (4.16). it turns out that for 4 out of the possible 16 sign

choices in (q5, q5, q2, qw) = (p5, p5, p2, pw) we obtain eigenvalues

 = 2(0, p5 + p2, p5 + p2 + pw, p5 + p5) ,

(4.26)

for {q, q}, each with degeneracy 4. this expression summarises all the information about

the possible supersymmetry fractions that can be achieved; as usual, all the quantities

(p5, p5, p2, pw) should be considered to be non-negative. the various supersymmetry frac-

tions implied by taking all possible non-zero subsets of the (p5, p5, p2, pw) agree completely

with those obtained by explicitly solving the killing-spinor equations. the mass/charge

relation for these supersymmetric solutions is given by

e  p5 + p5 + p2 + pw = (q2 + qw)  (q5 + q5) ,

or

 (q2 + qw)  (q5  q5) . (4.27)

note that the other 12 possible sign choices in (q5, q5, q2, qw) = (p5, p5, q2, qw)

divide into three further sets of 4, with each set leading to eigenvalues as follows:

 = (p5 + p2, p5 + p2, pw, p5 + p5 + pw) ,

 = (p2, p5 + pw, p5 + pw, p5 + p5 + p2) ,

(4.28)

 = (p5, p5, p2 + pw, p5 + p5 + p2 + pw) .

thus with all four charges turned on, none of these other sets gives rise to any preserved

supersymmetry. note also that if we make the opposite sign choice for the chirality pro-

jection, then the same sets of eigenvalues (4.26) and (4.28) occur, but now with dierent

combinations of sign choice in (q5, q5, q2, qw) = (p5, p5, q2, qw) being associated with

each set of eigenvalues.

the above example provides another manifestation of a supersymmetry rule obtained in

[11]. namely, when a new intersecting ingredient is introduced in a set of intersections, if it

breaks a further half of the supersymmetry then the structure of the eigenvalues of {q, q}

is independent of the sign of the new charge. if, on other hand, the introduction of the

new charge does not break supersymmetry further, then it would break the supersymmetry

completely if it were instead introduced with the opposite sign. thus for n intersecting
objects that preserve 1/2n of the supersymmetry with n  n , 2n out of the 2n possible

choices of solutions are supersymmetric while the rest are non-supersymmetric.

finally, in our discussion of supersymmetry in the heterotic framework, we examine

the situation where we include the yang-mills elds, and consider the solutions where h

15

and eh are non-singular functions with yang-mills instanton sources, as given in (3.7). the

supersymmetry transformation rule for the gravitino is unchanged from the one in the n = 1

truncation of the type ii theory, and so our previous calculation of the supersymmetry in

the gravitino sector goes through unchanged. (in the derivation of the killing spinors, for

example in (4.6), it was not important that the functions h and eh be harmonic.) however,

we now have to consider also the supersymmetry transformations of the gaugini a and ,
which are the superpartners of the su (2) yang-mills elds ba

(1) and b

(1) respectively. these

take the form

a = ga

ij ij  ,

 = g

mn mn  .

(4.29)

now, if ga

ij is self-dual or anti-self-dual, we shall therefore nd that the killing spinors 

should satisfy

respectively, with similar conclusions in the ~z space for . equivalently, we can express

(ij  1

2 ijk k)  = 0

(4.30)

these conditions as

 = 1234  ,

 = 5678  .

(4.31)

bearing in mind that we also have the chirality condition (4.24) (or its opposite), we see

that the conditions (4.31) are of the same form as the ones already encountered in (4.11).

thus the question of whether the solutions are supersymmetric or not comes down to the

issue of achieving a proper correlation of signs, with the self-duality or anti-self-duality

choice for the yang-mills instantons being correlated with the chirality sign convention for

the spinors of the heterotic theory. provided the signs are properly chosen, the preserved

supersymmetry fractions for the yang-mills instanton-supported solutions in the heterotic

theory will be the same as for their corresponding singular-source limits.

4.3 further comments

in the previous discussion we demonstrated that the correspondence between the counting

of zero-eigenvalues in the anticommutator {q, q} and the counting of killing spinors holds

if the energy contribution from each intersecting ingredient is non-negative. one cannot

trust any additional zero-eigenvalues that arise by virtue of having any negative-energy

contributions from any of the intersecting ingredients. it should be emphasised, however,

that one does not always get the wrong conclusion from the {q, q} calculation when there

are negative-energy contributions. for example, for a simple extremal p-brane solution
preserving 1

2 supersymmetry the analogous result is {q, q} = 2(0, p)1l16, and this correctly
implies that there will continue to be 16 unbroken components of supersymmetry even if the

16

mass is taken to be negative. (the killing spinor equation continues to admit 16 solutions,

even if one sets the mass negative.) but the {q, q} calculation is giving the correct

conclusion for the wrong reason if the mass is negative. on the other hand, it seems that

in all cases where there appear to be enhanced supersymmetry fractions for particular tuned

sets of charges that involve negative-energy contributions, the conclusion is always wrong.

although killing spinor solutions still exist even if an intersecting ingredient contributes

a negative energy, the behavior of the killing spinor will become singular. to see this,

recall that the killing spinor solution (4.8) holds regardless of the detailed structure of the

harmonic functions k, h, eh or w . when each intersecting ingredient has positive energy,

these harmonic functions take values between 1 and , and hence the killing spinors are

nite. on the other hand, if any intersecting object contributes a negative energy, then

the associated harmonic function takes values between 1 and 0, with a naked singularity

occurring at the latter value. as can be seen from (4.8), the killing spinor blows up at the

naked singularity.

in most examples, requiring the regularity of the killing spinor leads to a positive energy

contribution, which in turn implies cosmic censorship [24]. however, as observed in [21],

when a 5-brane with negative mass is supported by a yang-mills instanton of sucient

scale size, the previous singularity in metric can be smeared out by the instanton, and

hence the killing spinor is also well-behaved. in this case, the continued violation of the

relation between the zero-eigenvalue counting in {q, q} and the counting of killing spinors

is caused by the fact that the energy-momentum tensor of the yang-mills instanton elds

now violates the positive-energy condition [21].

for n intersecting objects that preserve 1/2n of the supersymmetry, the eigenvalues of

the anticommutator {q, } have the form

 = (e  p1      pn ) = 2(0, p1, p2, . . . , pn , p1 + p2, p1 + p3, . . . , p1 +    pn ) ,

(4.32)

where the total energy is e = pi pi. thus the anticommutator {q, q} would have negative

eigenvalues if any of the objects contributes a negative energy. on the other hand, if the n
intersecting objects preserve 1/2n of the supersymmetry with n < n , then {q, q} can still

remain positive even if some of the individual energy contributions are negative, since in

these cases, not all the individual energy contributions appear in isolation as eigenvalues.

for example, the eigenvalues in (4.19) will remain non-negative even if we set q2 + q5 =

0. the phenomenon was observed in [25] in the context of 4-charge black holes in four-

dimensional heterotic string theory, where the eigenvalues of {q, q} are 2{0, p1 + p2, p3 +

p4, p1 + p2 + p3 + p4} and the energy is e = p1 + p2 + p3 + p4. thus one can obtain

17

a massless black hole by setting p1 + p2 = 0 and p3 + p4 = 0, without there being any

negative eigenvalues. another example in the literature is the dyonic string in n = 1

supergravity, for which {q, q} has eigenvalues 2{0, p1 + p2}, with energy e = p1 + p2

[16, 21]. it follows that the dyonic string becomes tensionless when p1 + p2 = 0. (of course

as usual, one should not take the occurrence of extra zero-eigenvalues in these limits as

indicating enhanced supersymmetry.) it seems that solutions such as the above massless

ones, where no negative eigenvalues occur in {q, q}, may have a more solid relation to states

in the quantum theory than ones where masslessness is achieved at the price of negative

eigenvalues.

in our present case in this paper, from an m-theory perspective, there is no choice of

parameters such that the energy e = p5 + ep5 + p2 + pw vanishes while the eigenvalues in

the associated anticommutator (4.19) all remain positive. on the other hand, from the

heterotic perspective the eigenvalues in the superalgebra are truncated to (4.26), and hence

it is possible to obtain a massless solution with purely non-negative eigenvalues in the

associated superalgebra. of course achieving the massless solution requires negative-energy

contributions from some of the intersecting ingredients, and hence either the killing spinor

blows up, or the yang-mills energy density becomes negative. such a pathology may imply

a phase transition of the type discussed in [28, 16].

5 near-horizon structure

for a single-center conguration, the solutions to equations (3.5) can be taken to be:

k = (1 +

h = 1 +

2qe
r2 )(1 +
2(r2 + 2a2)
(r2 + a2)2

2q
e
2 ) ,

w = (1 +

2qw
r2 )(1 +

2q
w
2 ) ,

,

eh = 1 +

2(2 + 2b2)
(2 + b2)2 ,

(5.1)

where r2 = yiyi and 2 = zmzm. here a and b are the sizes of the instantons supporting

each of the 5-branes.

let us now consider what happens if the two instanton sizes a and b vanish. in this

situation, the functions h and eh become harmonic functions. let us consider the horizon
region with r   0 and r/ non-vanishingly nite. in this region, the additive constants
1 in these two functions h and eh can be dropped. also k  4qeq
e/(r2 2). in this
region the dilaton scalar  becomes constant, and the metric becomes (for simplicity, we

consider qeq

e = 1)

the four-dimensional conguration (5.3) is the solution to the lagrangian

2 e2 ()2 + m2 e ,

(5.3)

(5.4)

which is the scalar lagrangian of four-dimensional su (2)  su (2) gauged supergravity,

constructed in [29].

making the coordinate transformation y = log(r ) and z = log(r/), the metric (5.3)

becomes

ds2

4 = 1

4 e2x (w 1 dt2 + w (dx + (w 1  1) dt)2) + dy2 + dz2 ,

w = (1 + qw eyz)(1 + q

w ey+z) .

(5.5)

when qw = q

w = 0, the four-dimensional metric becomes ads3  s1, as discussed in [22].
(various intersections whose near horizon structures give rise to an ads3 spacetime were
given in [9].) when the 1s are dropped from w , the above spacetime becomes k3  s1,

where kd denotes the generalised kaigorodov metric in d dimensions [30]. note that k3

is locally equivalent to the btz black hole constructed in [31]. the near-horizon structure

of this intersection was also discussed in [23], from an eleben-dimensional point of view.

the area of the horizon for the metric (5.2), and hence the entropy, is proportional to

pqw q

w. on the other hand, when the instanton sizes a and b are non-vanishing, the area
of the horizon, and hence the corresponding entropy, would be zero. an analogous phase

transition occurs also when two instantons coalesce, which increases the area of the horizon.

the entropy associated with the non-vanishing area of the horizon can be understood from

the two-dimensional boundary conformal eld theory of the ads3 spacetime.

note that the lagrangian (3.1) also admits a dierent type of four-object intersec-

tion, namely a string, 5-brane, pp-wave and nut. this intersection is of the standard

type, and gives rise to a 4-charge black hole [26] in d = 4. the near-horizon structure is
btz(s3/zn)  e4 [27]. by contrast, the near-horizon structure of the four-object inter-
section discussed in this paper is k3  s3  s3  s1.

6 conclusions

in this paper, we have constructed extremal solutions in d = 10, comprising the non-

standard intersection of two 5-branes together with a string and a pp-wave. this can arise

19

as a solution in the n = 1 truncation of the type ii theory, with singular sources for all the

ingredients in the intersection. this conguration can be oxidised to a solution in d = 11,

where the string now becomes a membrane living in the common world-volume directions

of the 5-branes. it can instead be viewed as a solution in the heterotic theory, in which

case it is possible to replace the singular sources for the 5-branes by self-dual yang-mills

instantons. an unusual feature here is that, owing to the non-standard nature of the 5-brane

intersection, in which they have non-overlapping 4-dimensional transverse spaces, there can

be a separate su (2) instanton for each 5-brane. this solution therefore makes use of an

su (2)  su (2) subgroup of the e8  e8 or so(32) gauge group of the heterotic string.

we presented a detailed discussion of the supersymmetry of the intersecting solution.

in particular, we compared the results from an explicit construction of the killing spinors

with a counting of the zero eigenvalues of the anticommutator of supercharges, {q, q}. we

showed that the two are in agreement, provided one discounts as spurious the additional

zero eigenvalues of {q, q} that can arise for special tuned non-vanishing values for certain

of the charges. we argued that, as discussed in previous examples in the literature [19, 21],

the naive counting of zero eigenvalues of {q, q} can give misleading results, if any of the

components in the intersection is giving a negative contribution to the total energy. having

exhibited this phenomenon in specic examples, the implication is that one should always

treat apparent supersymmetry enhancements seen from supercharge anticommutators with

suspicion, unless there is some compelling argument for why they are not spurious.
