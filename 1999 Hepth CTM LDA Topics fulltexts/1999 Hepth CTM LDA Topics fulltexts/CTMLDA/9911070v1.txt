abstract

we explore the (non)-universality of martinezs conjecture, originally pro-
posed for kerr black holes, within and beyond general relativity. the con-
jecture states that the brown-york quasilocal energy at the outer horizon of
such a black hole reduces to twice its irreducible mass, or equivalently, to
a/2, where a is its area. we rst consider the charged kerr black hole.
for such a spacetime, we calculate the quasilocal energy within a two-surface
of constant boyer-lindquist radius embedded in a constant stationary-time
slice. keeping with martinezs conjecture, at the outer horizon this energy
equals to a/2. the energy is positive and monotonically decreases to
the adm mass as the boundary-surface radius diverges. next we perform an
analogous calculation for the quasilocal energy for the kerr-sen spacetime,
which corresponds to four-dimensional rotating charged black hole solutions
in heterotic string theory. the behavior of this energy as a function of the
boundary-surface radius is similar to the charged kerr case. however, we
show that it does not approach the expression conjectured by martinez at the
horizon.

i. introduction

a geometric theory of gravity, such as general relativity, is known to lack a meaningful
notion of local energy density [13]. this is essentially due to the absence of an unambigu-
ous prescription for decomposing the spacetime metric into background and dynamical
components. the low-energy eective eld theory for heterotic string theory is no exception.
such theories, however, admit several alternative prescriptions for computing quasilocal en-
ergies (see refs. [3,4] and the references therein).
in ref. [3] (henceforth referred to as
by), brown and york introduced a way to dene the quasilocal energy (qle) of a spatially
bounded system in general relativity in terms of the total mean curvature of the boundary.
in this paper, we rst apply this denition to the case of charged kerr family of black hole
spacetimes, which represent rotating, charged black hole solutions in general relativity. next
we apply it to study the behavior of quasilocal energy of the kerr-sen family, which repre-
sents rotating, charged black hole solutions in heterotic string theory [5]. since the static,
charged (or neutral) solution is a special case of this family, the qle of such a solution
is obtained in the limit of vanishing angular momentum (or charge). we perform these
calculations in the regime of the slow-rotation approximation.

the motivation for the analysis in this paper is as follows. it is of interest to explore
the form of the classical laws of black hole mechanics and the ensuing picture of black hole
thermodynamics in alternative theories of gravity such that they can be compared with
the corresponding scenario in general relativity. but the study of the thermodynamical laws
entails the knowledge of the energy and entropy associated with these spacetimes. moreover,
equilibrium thermodynamics of a black hole (specically, in the case of an asymptotically at
solution), requires that it be put in a nite-sized box, just as one does in general relativity
[7]. thus, such a study requires the knowledge of the quasilocal energy of these nite-sized
systems. moreover, in a study of the quasilocal energy corresponding to dierent types of
two-boundaries embedded in constant stationary-time slice of the kerr spacetime (in the
slow-rotation approximation), martinez has conjectured that the qle approaches twice the
irreducible mass of such a black hole. in this paper, we study the (non)-universality of this
conjecture. we nd that it remains valid for the charged kerr black hole. in the case of the
kerr-sen black hole, however, we show that the qle evaluated on a two-surface of constant
boyer-lindquist radius embedded in a constant stationary-time slice does not approach the
expression conjectured by martinez at the horizon.

we introduce the by quasilocal energy in section ii. we use this denition in section
iii to nd the qle of the charged kerr black hole. similarly, in section iv we evaluate the
qle of the kerr-sen black hole. we present our observations on the results of these sections
and discuss the status of martinezs conjecture for these two cases in section v. finally, in
appendix a we derive the integral expression for the qle associated with a certain class of
quasilocal two-surfaces embedded in an axisymmetric spatial three-slice. this expression is
extensively used in this paper for the qle computations for dierent spacetimes mentioned
above. we follow the conventions of ref. [1] and employ geometrized units g = 1 = c.

ii. brown-york quasilocal energy

the by derivation of the quasilocal energy, as applied to a four-dimensional (4d) space-
time solution of einstein gravity can be summarized as follows. the system one considers is
a 3d spatial hypersurface  bounded by a 2d spatial surface b in a spacetime region that
can be decomposed as a product of a 3d hypersurface and a real line-interval representing
time. the time-evolution of the boundary b is the surface 3b. one can then obtain a sur-
face stress-tensor on 3b by taking the functional derivative of the action with respect to the
3d metric on 3b. the energy surface density is the projection of the surface stress-tensor
normal to a family of spacelike surfaces such as b that foliate 3b. the integral of the energy
surface density over such a boundary b is the quasilocal energy associated with a spacelike
intersection with 3b is the boundary b. here we assume
hypersurface  whose orthogonal
that there are no inner boundaries, such that the spatial hypersurfaces  are complete. in
the case where horizons form, one simply evolves the spacetime inside as well as outside the
horizon. under these conditions, the qle is dened as:

e =

1

8 ib

d2x(k  k0) ,

(2.1)

where  is the determinant of the 2-metric on b, k is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of
b, and k0 is a reference term that is used to normalize the energy with respect to a reference
spacetime, not necessarily at. to compute the qle for asymptotically at solutions, we
will choose the reference spacetime to be at as well. in that case, k0 is the trace of the
extrinsic curvature of a two-dimensional surface embedded in at spacetime, such that it is
isometric to b.

interestingly, the foregoing analysis can be applied in a straightforward way to compute
qle of spatial sections of solutions of scalar-tensor theories as well. this is because, for
spacetime dimensions higher than two, a scalar-tensor theory can be cast in the einstein-
hilbert form by performing a conformal transformation. the solutions of this conformally
related action are given by the einstein-frame metrics, which themselves are related to
solutions of the scalar-tensor theory by a conformal transformation. it was shown in ref.
[4] that the quasilocal mass (qlm), which is a construct related to qle, is invariant under
such a transformation. when there is a timelike killing vector eld  on the boundary 3b,
such that it is also hypersurface forming, one can dene an associated conserved qlm for
the bounded system [6,3]:

d(d1)x  n ,

m = zb

(2.2)

where n is the lapse function related to  by  = nu. further, if   u = 1, then
n = 1 and consequently the qlm is the same as the qle. unlike qle, the quasilocal mass
is independent of any foliation of the bounded system. moreover, owing to its conformal
invariance, a frame of convenience can be chosen for the computation of qlm without
aecting its value. the qle, in general, is not a conformal invariant. thus, the frame in
which it is evaluated needs to be clearly specied. in this paper, all computations of the
qle will be carried out in the einstein frame. this is the frame in which sen analyzed the
properties of his rotating charged black hole solution.

iii. qle for charged kerr black holes

the charged kerr solution in general relativity represents the spacetime of a rotating,
charged black hole. its spacetime metric and electromagnetic vector potential are given by

where

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)
(3.4)

the above elds dene a black hole solution with mass m, charge q, and specic angular
momentum a.

a. unreferenced qle for charged kerr black holes

consider a constant stationary-time hypersurface  embedded in the charged kerr space-
time with the metric (3.1). dene the two-surface b to be a surface with some constant
value for the boyer-lindquist radial coordinate, r = r0, embedded in . the line-element
on this surface in the slow-rotation approximation, i.e., a  r0, is:

ds2  r2

(3.5)

terms of order o(a4/r4

0) and higher have been neglected.

we now calculate the unreferenced qle at the two-surface b, dened by r = r0. we
assume that r0  r+, where r+ represents the outer horizon of the charged kerr black hole.
using eq. (a6) of the appendix, the unreferenced qle  for the surface r = r0 can be
written explicitly as

which is the unreferenced qle of the reissner-nordstrom black holes [3].

note that no approximations have been made inside the square-root appearing in . as
r0  , we have   m  r0, which is divergent. this prompts the need for a subtraction
term to renormalize the unreferenced qle. below, we compute such a reference term.

b. reference term

to obtain the reference term in the qle expression, eq. (2.1), we rst nd a 2d surface

isometric to (3.5), which is embeddable in a at 3d slice with the line element

ds2 = dr2 + r2d2 + r2 sin2  d2 ,

(3.10)

where r, , and  are the spherical polar coordinates. let the desired 2d surface in the
at slice be characterized by r = f (), where f is a function of the azimuthal angle  and
the parameters (m, a, r0). its intrinsic metric is obtained from (3.10) as follows. we assume
that  = () and  = . then, on the two-surface b, we nd that r is a function of ,
i.e., r = r(), say. hence, the line-element on b is

ds2 = [ r2 + r2 2]d2 + r2 sin2 d2 ,

(3.11)

where an overdot denotes derivative with respect to .

requiring the above line-element to be isometric to (3.5) implies that the following couple

of equations be obeyed:

r2 + r2 2 = r2

assuming that

(3.14)

(3.15)

putting this back in eq. (3.13), we nd r(). in the resulting expression, using eq. (3.15)
to substitute for  in terms of , we nally get

the two-surface r = f () then describes an oblate spheroid, which bulges out near the
equator (i.e., near  = /2). note that the above equations can be used to prove that
indeed r2  o(a4/r4
0).

(3.17)

the extrinsic curvature k0 of this surface embedded in at space can be evaluated using the
method detailed in the appendix. this in turn can be used to compute the renormalization
integral in the qle (2.1):

0 = r0"1 +

iv. the kerr-sen solution

consider the following string-inspired low-energy eective action in four dimensions:

s =

hrh r  g +

(4.1)

here g is the metric, r is the scalar curvature, f = a  a is the eld strength
corresponding to the maxwell eld a,  is the dilaton eld, and

hr = br + cyclic permutations  (3(a))r

,

where b is the antisymmetric tensor gauge eld. above we have dened

(3(a))r =

1
4

(afr + cyclic permutations) ,

(4.2)

(4.3)

it must be noted that the above theory is one
which is the gauge chern-simons term.
where 6 of the 10 dimensions have been compactied to a six-torus. the massless elds
arising from compactication have not been included in the eective action. only a u(1)
component of the full set of non-abelian gauge elds present in the theory has been included
above. consequently, the corresponding solutions carry a u(1) charge only. the metric g
used here is the metric that arises naturally in the -model, and is related to the einstein
metric g through the relation:

g = eg .

(4.4)

finally, the action was truncated to contain only those terms that contain two or a lesser
number of derivatives.

sen showed that the above theory has rotating charged black hole solutions given by the

following eld conguration [5]:

were also found in ref. [8]. )

a. unreferenced qle for kerr-sen black hole

consider a constant stationary-time hypersurface  embedded in the kerr-sen spacetime
with the metric (4.5a). dene the two-surface b to be the surface with some constant value
for the boyer-lindquist radial coordinate r = r0, embedded in . the line element on this
surface in the slow-rotation approximation, i.e., a  r0, is:

we now calculate the unreferenced qle within the two-surface b, dened by r = r0.
we assume that r0  r+, where r+ represents the outer horizon of the kerr-sen black hole.
using eq. (a6) of the appendix, the integral  for the surface r = r0 can be written explicitly

reference term required to renormalize this qle.

b. two-surface isometric to b embedded in at space

to obtain the reference term in the qle expression, eq. (2.1), we rst nd a 2d surface

isometric to (4.12), which is embeddable in a at 3d slice with the line element

ds2 = dr2 + r2d2 + r2 sin2  d2 .

(4.18)

the equation for the desired 2d surface in the at slice is denoted by r = g(), where g is
a function of the azimuthal angle  and the parameters (m, a, r0) of the surface in . its
intrinsic metric is obtained from (4.18). we assume that  = () and  = . then, on
the two-surface r is a function of , i.e., r = r(), say. hence, the line-element on it is
given by eq. (3.11).
similar to the case of the charged kerr black hole discussed in section iii b , even for
the kerr-sen spacetime, requiring the line-element (3.11) to be isometric to (4.12) yields the
following rst-order ordinary dierential equation:

v. discussion

the brown-york quasilocal energy of a kerr black hole, for the type of slice  and
quasilocal surface b considered in this paper, has not been evaluated yet for the exact case
(i.e., beyond the slow-rotation approximation). one of the main hurdles in this computation
is the determination of the two-surface r = f (), isometric to b, to be embedded in a at
three-slice. it is nevertheless interesting to explore the slow-rotation regime of such black
holes in general relativity and alternative theories of gravity for the results obtained can
often tell us about the behavior of certain physical quantities in the exact case. one such
quantity is the value of qle at the (outer) horizon of such black holes, which for the kerr
black hole approaches twice its irreducible mass.
in this paper, we nd that this result
continues to hold even for the charged kerr black hole. thus, within general relativity, this
identity appears to bear a universal quality as far as its applicability to stationary black
hole solutions is concerned.

it is known that the mechanical laws of stationary black hole solutions in general relativity
are extendible also to other alternative theories of gravity, especially ones connected with a
dieomorphism invariant lagrangian. one such leading alternative to general relativity is a
string-inspired four-dimensional low-energy eective theory. it is of interest to ask if other
identities related to black hole mechanics in general relativity continue to hold for black
holes in string theory. this motivated us to study the status of martinezs conjecture in the
context of the kerr-sen family of black holes, which arise as solutions in heterotic string
theory. we rst nd the qle of such black holes for a choice of three-slice  quasilocal
surface b identical to the ones used to evaluate the qle of charged kerr black holes. this
expression is found to have the correct limits when the radial coordinate is made to diverge,
or when the charge is made to vanish. however, at the outer horizon, the qle for such
black holes does not reduce to twice its irreducible mass. it is important to note that the
value of the qle is inuenced by the choice of a reference term. in fact, at the outer horizon

12

it is solely this reference term that contributes to the qle. it may be, therefore, be possible
to motivate an alternative reference term that is concommitant with the applicability of
martinezs conjecture even for such black holes. we hope to return to this issue elsewhere.

appendix a: qle on a two-sphere embedded in 

here we show how to compute the trace the extrinsic curvature, k, corresponding to a
closed two-surface b embedded in a 3d axisymmetric riemannian manifold. the result can
then be used in eq. (2.1) to evaluate the energy integrals appearing in several places in this
paper. an analogous calculation is given in ref. [10]. it is discussed here for the sake of
completeness only.

consider a 3d axisymmetric spacelike hypersurface  described by the line element

hijdxidxj = x2dr2 + y2d2 + z2 d2 ,

(a1)

where xi = (r, , ) denote arbitrary coordinates adapted to the symmetry. the metric
coecients x, y, and z depend only on the radial and azimuthal coordinates r and ,
respectively. an arbitrary 2d axisymmetric surface b having the topology of a two-sphere,
and embedded in 3d space  is dened by the relation r = r(), where r is a function of
the azimuthal angle and the parameters of the solution. its two-dimensional line element is

abdxadxb = (x2r2 + y2)d2 + z2 d2 ,

(a2)

where a prime denotes dierentiation with respect to the coordinate . the functions x, y,
and z in (a2) are evaluated at the two-surface r = r().

let ni denote the unit outward-pointing spacelike normal to b as embedded in . its

components are

(nr, n, n) =

1

y2 + x2r2

(y/x ,x r/y , 0) .

(a3)

the extrinsic curvature of the two-surface b as embedded in  is denoted by k. its trace
k can be written as

(nh)

h

,

k = 

(a4)

where h denotes the determinant of the three-metric h. using the coordinate-components
of the unit normal (a3) we nd that the trace is

this integral is evaluated at the surface r = r(). finally note that both integrals in eq.
(2.1) are of the general form (a6). it is, however, important to note that each one of these
integrals involves dierent values for the functions x, y, and z. also, the coordinates on the
two-surface,  and , which appear in these two integrals, may not always have identical
denitions.
