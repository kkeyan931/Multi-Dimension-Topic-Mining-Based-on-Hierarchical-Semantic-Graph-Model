abstract

we study the gauge bosons coupled to spin 2 operators as the singleton

elds in three-dimensional anti-de sitter space(ads3). one of these can be

expressed in terms of a pair of dipole a and b which couple to d and c

operators at timelike innity of ads3. these operators form the logarithmic

conformal eld theory(lcft2). using the correlation function for logarith-

mic pair, we calculate the greybody factor for the gauge boson. in the low

temperature limit of   t, this is compared with the result of the bulk
ads3 calculation. we nd that the gauge boson can be realized as a model

of the ads3/lcft2 correspondence.

recently the ads/cft correspondence has attracted much interest [13]. this means

that the string/m theory on adsd+1 is dual to the gauge theory of the cftd on its boundary.

this was used to resolve many problems in black hole physics [4,5,7,8]. for the test of

the ads3/cft2 correspondence one introduces a set of test elds {i} on ads3 and their
corresponding operators {oi} on the boundary. for example, these are in the d1-d5 brane
system : a free scalar() which couples to (1,1) operator; two xed scalars(, ) to (2,2),

(3,1), and (1,3) operators; two intermediate scalars(, ) to (1,2) and (2,1) operators [9].

the relevant relation between these is given by [3]

ese ({i}) = herb

b,ioi

i.

(1)

the expectation value h  i is taken in the cft with the boundary test eld b,i as a source.
eq.(1) was widely used for calculations of the entropy, greybody factor(2-point function),

3- and 4-point functions.

it was shown by studying exchange diagram with scalar and

gauge elds in n=4 susy yang-mills from ads5 that the 4-point function has logarithmic

singularities [10]. more recently kogan found that a dipole pair(a, b) of singletons induces
the 2-point correlation function for a logarithmic pair(o,o) [11]. he argued that this is
the origin of logarithmic singularities in the 4-point functions. this logarithmic pair with
the normalization factor c = 2(  1)2/ [7] has the 2-point correlation fucntions [12]

(2)

here  is a degenerate dimension  of o and o and we note a crucial relation
ho(x)o(y)i = ho(x)o(y)i
. although (2) is mostly based on two-dimensional models, this
structure is universal for any lcftd.



in the ads3/cft2 correspondence, there exists a puzzle of the missing states between

cft2 and supergravity [13]. the gauge bosons appear in the resolution of this puzzle. these

are chiral primaries which correspond to the descendent of the identity operator in the cft2

2

[6]. but on the supergravity side these are absent and thus are considered as unphysical

singletons on ads3 [14]. in this sense, it is very important to test their correspondence. the

authors in [15] found that these bosons coupled to (2,0) and (0,2) operators on the boundary

receive logarithmic corrections from the bulk ads3 scattering calculation. of course this was

performed in the low temperature limit of   t.

in this paper, we derive the greybody factor for one of these gauge bosons coupled to

(2,0) operator. first we wish to represent this with a pair of dipole (a, b) coupled to

(1,1) operators(d, c). this means that a gauge boson with spin 2 operator is expressed

in terms of two dipole ghost elds with spin 0 operators. and then we calculate the two-

point function of their operators in terms of the btz coordinates. using this, we obtain the

greybody factor. finally we will compare this with the result of a bulk ads3 scattering in the

low-temperature limit. it is very important to test whether its ads3/cft2 correspondence

is valid. instead of this correspondence, we nd that the ads3/lcft2 correspondence is

suitable for the gauge bosons.

we start with the bulk ads3 action for a dipole pair(a, b) [11]

se = z d3xg(cid:20)a  b  m2ab

b2(cid:21) .

its equations of motion are given by

(cid:16)2 + m2(cid:17) a + b = 0, (cid:16)2 + m2(cid:17) b = 0.

(4)

a solution to these can be found from a boundary-bulk green function for habi with mass

as far as we know, this is the rst result for a dipole pair(singletons). now let us compare

this with the result of a gauge boson with s = 2 from an exact ads3 scattering [15]

gb
abs = 2r2s2[1 + rs ln(rs)].

(19)

for this purpose, we take the low temperature limit of   t and  = 2 on aa
case the digamma function  can take an asymptotic form as [21]

abs . in this

(1 + iy) = (1  iy)  ln y +

12y2 +

120y4 +    .

in the low temperature limit, aa

abs takes the form

aa
abs = 2r2 [1 + 2 ln(r) + c] ,

(20)

(21)

where c = 2  1  2 ln 2 with the eulers constant  = 0.5772. up to the constant c,
the boundary lcft2 approach takes a similar form of the bulk ads3 scattering. here

the relevant quantity is the logarithmic term ln(r). we note that our logarithmic term

has nothing to do with the logarithmic corrections for minimally coupled scalars in the

ads bubble scattering [2,5]. actually this is related to the existence of non-conformally

6

invariant operators in the dual cftd. here the ads bubble means the near-horizon ads

with asymptotically at space. the ads/cft lore means that the conformal limit of the

gauge theory cftd corresponds to scattering in an exact ads scattering. so it appears that

the logarithmic term in the ads bubble is not allowed for the exact ads approach. our

logarithmic term has a dierent origin from this, because we use a pair of dipole to describe

a gauge boson in the exact ads3 background.

in conclusion, we derive the new greybody factor for a gauge boson from the lcft2

correlator hddi which corresponds to the derivative of the cft2 correlator hdci with
respect to the weight . in the low temperature limit the bulk ads3 result gb
abs leads to aa
abs

of the lcft2 approximately. this means that the gauge boson prefers to the ads3/lcft2

correspondence rather than the ads3/cft2, if it can be expressed in terms of a pair of

unphysical dipole (a, b) in three-dimensional spacetime.
