(3+1) dimensions, two procedures generally used generating massive gauge elds consistent gauge-invariance. one stuckelberg formulation  familiar higgs mechanism simplest form one uses 2-form potential (kalb-ramond eld) b coupled one-form gauge potential b f term, f = da eld-strength . theory two types gauge-invariance therefore highly constrained cou- plings geometrical. rst order formulation non-abelian yang-mills gauge theory ( bf-ym model)  b f term used contribute discussion quark connement continuum qcd. additionally, transmutation statistics point particles (2+1) dimensions generalized strings (3+1) dimensions via b f term . hand, so-called mixed chern-simons term, involves two one-form gauge elds, recently studied connection certain condensed matter systems , namely josephson junction arrays . letter, consider new topological term (2+1) dimensions, obtained dimensional reduction b f (3+1) dimensional abelian model (to best knowledge, term studied explicit form presented here). term form b involves b 0-form eld . show term generate mass kalb-ramond eld well scalar eld. action non-chern-simons topological term, leads us classical duality free klein-gordon maxwell actions. hand, using stuckelberg formulation, alternative massive gauge-invariant model constructed. finally, motivated fact interchange topological noether current usually denotes duality transformation, also shown topological action 2+1 dimensions kalb- ramond eld related buschers duality transformation  stukelberg-type theory. ii. non-chern-simons topological term starting point abelian b f four-dimensional action  sbf = zm4 (cid:8)b f g2b b(cid:9) . (1) action formulated terms two-form potential b f = da eld- strength one-form gauge potential hodge star (duality) operator. quadratic term included latter convenience. dimensional reduction usually done expanding elds normal modes corre- sponding compactied extra dimensions, integrating extra dimensions. approach useful dual models superstrings . here, however, consider elds higher dimensions independent extra dimensions. case, assume elds independent extra coordinate x3. (1), performing dimensional reduction described above, get three dimensions = zm3 (cid:8)b + v f g2b b + g2v v(cid:9) , (2) 2 v 1-form 0-form elds respectively. recognize b topological sense explicit dependence space-time metric. one stress term may confused two-dimensional version b f , involves scalar one-form elds {$9609240$}. moreover, term equivalent four-dimensional b f term present action (2) (the so-called mixed chern-simons term, v f ). hand, action displays local tensor gauge symmetry whose origin connected topological character model present still invariance u(1) u(1). iii. topological mass generation now, order show topological mass generation vector tensor elds, construct two variations model (2), introducing propagation terms. model propagation two-form gauge potential b topological term b may represented action = zm3 (cid:26)1 2 h h + 1 2 + b d(cid:27) , (3) second term klein-gordon term, mass parameter h = db three-form eld-strength b. follow steps used allen et al.  order show topological mass generation context b f model. thus, nd equations motion scalar tensor elds, respectively h = = h. (4) (5) applying sides eq. (5) using eq. (4), obtain equation motion , namely (dd + 2)d = 0. (6) repeating procedure reverse order, obtain equation motion h (dd + 2)h = 0. (7) equations rewritten 3 ((cid:3) + 2) = 0 ((cid:3) + 2)h = 0. (8) (9) therefore, uctuations h massive. obviously, two possibilities occurs simultaneously. indeed, interesting case, degree freedom massless eld eaten gauge eld b become massive eld completely decouples theory. hand, model propagation two one-form gauge elds repre- sented action = zm3 (cid:26)1 2 f f + v f + 1 2 g g(cid:27) , rst term maxwell one, g = dv. (10) (11) equation (10) highlight topological term involves two vector elds. equations motion df = dv dg = f. following former procedure get ((cid:3) + 2)f = 0, ((cid:3) + 2)g = 0, (12) (13) (14) (15) shows uctuations f g massive. last case already discussed ghosh et al. . 4 iv. classical duality let us take look following action zm3 (cid:20)b 1 2 b b(cid:21) (16) would like mention analogy action called bf-yang-mills model . latter formulation take advantage two-form gauge eld b use rst order formalism study pure yang-mills theory four dimensions. furthermore, bf- ym model (using stuckelberg auxiliary elds) preserves symmetries topological b f model, so, yang-mills theory viewed perturbative expansion around pure topological theory . present case, kalb-ramond eld also seen auxiliary eld, leading us free maxwell action. matter fact, non-abelian version (16) may interesting want treat 3d yang-mills theory rst order formalism. hand, consider action (16) master equation klein-gordon maxwell action (2+1) dimensions. indeed, easy see variation respect implies and, poincares lemma putting result (16), db = 0 b = da. sm = 1 2 zm3 f f, (17) maxwell action. performing variation respect b, write substituting (16) gives b = d. = 1 2 zm3 d. (18) so, master action (16) shown sm dual {$9705122$}. duality, specially considered framework non-abelian extensions, aids greatly unraveling interesting features models non-trivial topology. particular, may interesting study toward connection new gauge formulations three-dimensional gravity {$9705028$}. discussions consequences extensions (16) presented ref. . 5 v. st uckelberg-type mass generation would like introduce dierent type mass generation. stuckelberg for- mulation  enforces gauge invariance means auxiliary eld. starting point gauge invariant action: = zm3 (cid:26)1 2 h h m2(b d) ( b d)(cid:27) . action invariance b b + + , (19) (20) (21) stuckelberg one-form auxiliary eld respective transformation parameter. equations motion following action b h m2 ( b d) = 0 ( b d) = 0. (22) (23) current k = m2 ( b d) associated b eld conserved due equation motion eld, noether current. let us compare two dierent formulation spin-one massive theory, namely actions (19) (3). equation motion latter action kalb-ramond eld h = = jb. (24) therefore current jb algebraically conserved current, since ( )( d) = 0 (equiv- alently, j = 0). interchange topological noether current two dierent formulations massive spin-one gauge theory usually denotes duality transformation. shall see now, indeed case. consider global symmetry (3) form = b = 0. dual theory obtained procedure gauging global symmetry model one-form gauge eld constraining zero means closed 2-form lagrange multiplier 6 . thus gauge eld integrated theory expressed terms multiplier eld. well-known buschers duality procedure . procedure mind action (3) may rewritten = zm3 (cid:26)1 2 h h + 1 2 (d a) (d a) + b (d a) + a(cid:27) , (25) 2-form eld dened = d. deriving action (25) respect a, one gets (d a) = (b ), (26) integrating eld reobtain stuckelberg action (19). similar results discussed harikumar sivakumar context four- dimensional b f model . vi. conclusions summary, shown topologically massive theory arise three- dimensional models containing 2-form (kalb-ramond) 0-form elds. models obtained dimensional reduction b f four-dimensional theory. main analysis focused role played non-chern-simons topological term, namely, involving 2-form 0-form elds. showed term generate mass kalb-ramond eld. further, term favors classical duality equivalence massless scalar eld theory maxwell action. finally, shown 3d topologically massive theory describing spin-one par- ticle, topological term dierent usual b f term, dually equivalent stuckelberg-type spin-one theory. acknowledgments wish thank marcony silva cunha helpful discussions. work sup- ported part conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientco e tecnologico-cnpq fundacao coordenacao de aperfeicoamento de pessoal de nvel superior-capes. d. m. m. acknowledges universidade estadual ceara-uece great subsidy. 7
