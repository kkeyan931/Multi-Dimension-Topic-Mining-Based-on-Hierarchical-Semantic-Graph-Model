abstract

in this letter, we show how one can solve easily the potts-3 + branching inter-
actions and potts- matrix models, by the means of the equations of motion (loop
equations). we give an algebraic equation for the resolvents of these models, and
their scaling behaviour. this shows that the equations of motion can be a useful tool
for solving such models.

1 introduction :

random matrices are useful for a wide range of physical problems.
in particular, they
can be related to two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter elds with a non-
zero central charge c [1]. while c  1 models are relatively well understood, the c > 1
domain remains almost totally unknown : there is a c = 1 barrier. when studying c 6= 0
models, we are led to consider multi-matrix models [2, 3] which are often non-trivial. one
class of dicult matrix models corresponds to the q-state potts model (in short: potts-q)
on a random surface. this model is a q-matrix model where all the matrices are coupled
to each other, thus making dicult the use of usual techniques such as the saddle point
or the orthogonal polynomials method. moreover, the q  4 limit corresponds to c  1,
thus, by solving potts-q models, we shall gain a new understanding of the c = 1 barrier.
in this letter, we show that, contrary to what was previously thought, one can use the
loop equations to solve the potts-3 random matrix model, and we nd that the resolvent
(which generates many of the operators of the problem) obeys an algebraic equation that
we write explicitely.

we also show that this method applies when one adds branching interactions (gluing
of surfaces, also called branched polymers) [4] and we derive the critical line of this
extended model. the extension to the model with branching interactions and the study of
its phase diagram is necessary to verify [5]s conjecture about the c = 1 transition.

finally, we apply the method to the potts- matrix model, which corresponds to
c = .
as this work was approaching its completion, a paper appeared on the dilute potts
model [6], which partially overlaps our present work. in this article, the author also has an
algebraic equation for the conventional potts-3 model. here, we go further as we consider
the potts-3 + branching interactions model. moreover, his method is quite dierent : while
he uses analytical considerations on the resolvents and large-n techniques, we solve our
model by the loop equations method, which can be extended to nite n problems and is
also more adapted to the use of renormalization group techniques [7, 8].

general two-variable function, and will mainly appear through its partial derivatives u and
c with respect to tr2
if these are constants, then we recover
the conventional potts-3 model (no branching interactions). this model was given partial
solution by j.m. daul [9], by considering the analytic structure of the resolvents. he had
its critical point and its associated critical exponent. he did not know, however, if the
resolvent obeyed an algebraic equation. we shall give here the expression of this equation
for the conventional and extended potts-3 model. we also derive the critical line of the
extended model and check it corresponds to dauls result in the particular case of the
conventional model.

let us note, for convenience :

ti1i2 ink =

1
3n htri1i2 . . . inki

(4)

where i1, . . ., in can be +1, 1 or 0. this trace is non-zero if and only if i1 + . . . + in  0
(mod 3). h. . .i is the expectation value of (. . .) :

h. . .i =

1

z z d (. . .) en 2v ()

(5)

a trace will be said to be of degree m if there are m matrices  in it. for example, the
above trace is of degree k + n  1.

let us now use the method of the equations of motion (or loop equations). if we make

the innitesimal change of variables in z :

   +  i1 i2 . . . in

(6)

with

then we obtain the expression of the general equations of motion :

i1 + i2 + . . . + in  0

(mod 3)

g ti1...in2 + u ti1...in + c (t(i1+1)i2...(in1) + t(i11)i2...(in+1)) 

n1

xj=1

ti1...ij tij+1...in = 0

(7)

the rst three terms come from the transformation of v (), and the last one, from the

jacobian of the transformation.

eq. (7) relates any expectation value of trace containing a quadratic term (i.e. a 2
term) to expectation values of traces of lower degrees. the problem is that we do not
have any recursion relation for more general expectation values like ti1...in where all the
ik 6= 0. moreover, when one wants to compute even a very simple trace : for example tn

2

2 ] steps later, a n  [ n

by using eq. (7), one obtains, [ n
2 ] degree complicated trace which
does not contain quadratic terms any more. thus, the recursion stops there. in fact, this
problem can be overcome by a very simple idea : one uses the invariance of traces by cyclic
permutations to get rid of the n + 1 degree term in eq. (7). then, one obtains relations
between general traces, and it is thus possible to compute the expectation values of any
trace in function of the rst ones.

let us see now how this idea applies to the computation of the resolvent. we denote :

i1i2...in =

1
3n htri1i2 . . . in

1

z  i

0 =  is the usual resolvent. using the change of variables :

   + 

1

z  

we obtain the equation :

z (u + gz)   u  gz  g t  2 + 2 c 11 = 0

   + 11

1

z  

similarly,

yields :

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

z (u + gz) 11  (u + gz) t  g t11   11 + c 1 01 + c 111 = 0

(12)

and, by the means of similar changes in variables, we have the equations :

z (u + gz) 111  (u + gz) t11  g t111 + c 1 011 + c 1 111   111 = 0
(13)
z (u+gz) 1 111(u+gz) t111g t1 111+c 1 0 111+c 11 111 1 111 = 0

these equations alone are not sucient to compute (z).

(14)
indeed, if we intend to
calculate (z), we generate the function 11(z) (eq. (10)). then, in turn, we generate
the function 111(z) (eq. (12)) and so on.

as for  functions containing a 0 (i.e. a 2 term) such as 1 01, they are easy to deal
1
z, will be

with : we know how to compute traces containing 2. 1 01 = 1
seen as 1

z 1. then the change in variables :

3n tr21

3n tr121

yields (11 = 1 1 for symmetry reasons)

   + 1

1

z  

1

g 101 + (u + c) 11 + c z   c = 0

3

(15)

(16)

and similar changes in variables lead to the equations :

g 1 011 + u 111 + c 1 01 + c z 11  c t = 0

g 1 0 111 + u 1 111 + c z 111  c t11 + c 1 011  t  = 0

(17)

(18)

but, to compute 11 111, as mentionned in the comments to eq. (7), we have to

substract two dierent changes in variables and use cyclicity of traces :

   + [11(z  )11  11(z  )112]

(19)

yields :

c (11 111 + 1 1111  11 01  1 0 1 11)  111 + t 11 = 0

(20)

this equation, as we know how to compute 11, 111, 11 01 and 1 0 1 11, relates
11 111 to 1 1111.

   + (111(z  )1  111(z  )12)

allows us to relate similarly 1 1111 to 11111. then

   + (1(z  )1111  1(z  )1111)

(21)

allows us to relate 11111 to 11 1 1 1, and we have 11 1 1 1 = 1 1111 as the roles
of 1 and 1 are completely symmetric.
finally, as a result of these operations, we have :

1 1111 + 1 1111 = k(z)

(22)

where k(z) only contains easy to compute  functions. we can then write an equation
for 1 1111 and thus for 11 111 which only involves  functions that we either
already know or are able to compute similarly as was done during the two rst steps of the
procedure.

that way, our set of equations is closed, and we obtain a degree ve algebraic equation
for (z). this expression applies to general expressions of u and c. for the exact expression
of this equation see appendix a. the equation only contains four unknown parameters :

1
n htr1i, t11 =

1
n htr12i, t111 =

t =

1
n htr123i, t1 111 =

1
n htr1213i
(23)
these parameters are also those that would be involved if we used the renormalisation
group method [10, 7, 8] to compute the potts-3 model. the renormalization group ows
would relate the conventional potts-3 to the potts-3 + branching interactions model, with
arbitrary u and c; but the presence of t111 shows us it would also be related to the dilute
potts-3 model, where one has a 1
n tr(1 + 2 + 3)3 term. finally, the t1 111 term shows

4

us it may also be related to more complicated quartic models.

we are now going to derive from our equation the critical behaviour and critical line
of the model when u = 1 + htr2/6 and c is a constant. this is the most common type
of extension of a matrix model to branching interactions. the values of the unknown
parameters given in eq. (23) are xed by the physical constraint that the resolvent has
only one physical cut which corresponds to the support of the eigenvalues of . then, one
can study the critical behaviour of the model.

it is easy to look for the potts critical line. indeed, the scaling behaviour of the resolvent

is then, if we denote the physical cut of  as [a, b] :

(z)  (z  a)

5 when z  b

(24)

the corresponding exponent s is  1
the model.

5 , which corresponds to the c = 4

5 central charge of

rather than looking for the resolvent for any values of the coupling constants, it is
easier to search for the resolvent only on this critical line where the presence of the 6
5
exponent leads to simple conditions on the derivatives of the algebraic equation.

we obtain :

105 c3 + 4 g2 = 0
2480625 c2 (1  4c + 43c2) + 296100 c (15 + 113c) h  692968 h2 = 0

(25)

let us note here that, when h = 0 (no branching interactions) we recover the potts-3

bicritical point which agrees with dauls result [9] :

thus, we have shown that the resolvent for the model of potts-3 plus branching interac-
tions obeys a degree ve algebraic equation. we have found the critical line and exponent
of this extended model. this extends the results of daul [9] who had only derived the
position of the critical point and exponent of the conventional model. finally, let us recall
that, in a recent paper [6], p. zinn-justin obtains independently algebraic equations for
similar problems. his method, though, does not involve loop equations, and is rather in
the spirit of [9]. moreover, it does not address the problem of branching interactions and
thus overlaps our results only in the case of the conventional potts-3 model.

3 the potts- model :
we are now going to briey derive the solution for the potts- model, from the equations
of motion point of view. the purpose of this part is mainly to show the eciency of our
method on this c =  model. this model was previously studied by wexler in [11].

we can get rid of d(x, y) since, when x (gx + u) + c y  a(x)  b(y)
q = 0, d(x, y) remains
nite, thus g  gy b(y) c a(x) b(y) (gx + u) = 0. this is sucient to relate a(x) to b(y).
moreover, the value of b(y) is easy to compute when q = .

let us briey summarize this computation : we calculate the value of htrx ni in the
first :

q   limit.

htrx ni = htr1 . . . ni + o(

1
q

)

(30)

(recall that all the i play the same role).

if we now separate the rst n matrices from the remaining q  n (with q  n), and
suppose there is a saddle point for the eigenvalues of n+1+...+q
, then this saddle point is
(in the q   limit) independent from the matrices 1 , . . . , n. then, in this limit, up
to a change in variables : k = uku 1, we have n independent matrice 1 . . . n. each
of them has the partition function

q

zc = z d k en ( g

k+ctr kc )

(31)

as tr1 . . . n = tr 1 . . . n, we have htrx ni = trh 1ic . . .h nic where h. . .ic is the
expectation value obtained with the partition function zc (cf eq. (31) ).
the matrices k , k = 1, . . . n all play the same part, and htrx ni = trn

c, thus

trn

c = trh 1in

6

(32)

this must give us c, provided we calculate h 1ic in function of c. this is a solvable

problem, but it is much faster to note that

c = t 1qn qn

(33)

is solution. thus,

1

qnhtrx ni = (t)n, and b(y) is simply (y  t)1.

this gives us immediately the solution for a(x) : it obeys a second order equation and

reads :

a(x) =

1
2

(x(u + gx) + c t q(x(u + gx) + ct)2  4(u + gx + gt))

(34)

the potts- plus branched polymers model is thus very similar to an ordinary pure
gravity model. as previously, we compute the parameter t by imposing that the resolvent
a(x) has only one physical cut. the model is critical when a(x) behaves as (x  x0)
2 , x0
being a constant, and the critical point veries (as in [11]) :

and

(35)

let us note nally that the loop equations method used here is appropriate for the

renormalization group method of [10, 7, 8].

4 conclusion

in this letter, we have shown that it is possible to solve the potts-3 and potts- models
on two-dimensional random lattices through the method of the equations of motion. we
have obtained a closed set of loop equations for the potts-3 model, which was thought to
be impossible. we have shown that the potts-3 resolvent obeys an order ve equation,
and this new knowledge opens the door to the calculation of expectation values of the
operators of the model. we have extended the potts-3 conventional model to potts-3 plus
branching interactions, and given the general algebraic equation and the potts critical line
of this model. finally, we have shown our method also applies successfully to another
potts model : the potts- model. we hope to generalize soon our method to more general
potts-q models, in particular for large-q potts + branching interactions models.

note that u and c may depend, in the most general case, on t11 and t2, the latter
being related to t through the equation of motion : g t2 + (u + 2 c) t = 0.
in this
article, we have computed explicitely the critical line for the particular case of c constant
and u = 1 + h
