(8) (9) 2.2 grand canonical ensemble dene partition functions m-point correlation functions grand canonical ensemble following equations: z0,l = gm 0,l(x1, , xm) = xn =1 xn =1 n l n 0 zn , n l n 0 gm n (x1, , xm), (10) (11) 0 fugacity. exist various ways dening grand canonical ensemble cor- responding freedom choose dierent weights xed n sector. here, assigned extra n-dependent factor, n l, addition usual one, n 0 . criterion good grand canonical ensemble take correct thermodynamic limit, or, words, correctly take universal part sum (10) (11). is, correlation functions grand canonical ensemble critical value fugacity reproduce canonical ensemble large n: lim n gm n zn = lim 00,c gm 0,l z0,l . (12) illustrate mentioned criterion taking partition function example. since canonical ensemble partition function (6) behaves large n zn n 5/2 2en f (0)n 1v, grand canonical partition function approximated z0,l v xn =1 2 f (0) 2 f (0) z v 0 n l5/2 (/c)n dn n l5/2 en /c, = f (0)0, c = e1, = c . 3 (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) take l suciently large, integrand eq. (15) peak n c/ make n large approaching c. hand, l suciently large, non-universal small n behavior dominates summation cannot obtain correct answer large n limit grand canonical ensemble. 2.3 schwinger-dyson eq. subsection, recapitulate (naive) arguments correlation functions branched polymers given massless 3 theory {$9802085$}. lets consider following correlation functions, suitable schwinger-dyson analysis: f m(x1, , xm) = n 0 xn =1 y(ij):bond g z (n m)! xg:tree graph f (yi yj). n yi=1 dyi (d)(y1 x1) (d)(ym xm) (19) factor identical. see eq. (11) eq. (8) (n m)! means (n m) points xed points regarded 1 f m(x1, , xm) gm 0,l=0(x1, , xm) (20) large n limit. write fourier transform f m(x1, , xm) f m(p1, , pm1): (2)d(d)(p1 + + pm) f m(p1, , pm1) = z ddx1 ddxm eip1x1 eipmxm f m(x1, , xm). schwinger dyson equation 1-point function f 1 becomes b = eb, b f (0) f 1, seen gure 2. figure 3 illustrates eq. (22). critical point, bc = 1, c = e1, 1-point function b/k diverges. near critical point, n becomes large; b 2e 1/n, b = bc b, = c . 4 (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) b = = + + + ... = e b figure 2: schwinger-dyson equation one point function. grey blob black point mean f1 0, respectively. c b c b figure 3: schwinger-dyson equation, = beb. critical point, bc = 1, c = e1. next, consider 2-point function f 2(p). pick two points tree graph, x path connecting two points. thus, seen gure 4, 2-point function calculated f 2(p) = xs=1 f (p)s( f 1)s+1 = b2h(p) f (0)(1 bh(p)) , h(p) f (p)/ f (0) = 1 ca2 0p2 + . (29) (30) (31) (32) c positive constant order one. recall f (x) damps rapidly region 0 < x < a0, shown gure 1. near critical point, b bc = 1, 2-point correlation function behaves (33) f 2(p) 1 b + ca2 0p2 5 f =^ 2 figure 4: 2-point function f 2 made 1-point function f 1, written gray blob. 1 n 1/2 + ca2 0p2 . (34) used eq. (26). thus, correlation length = a0n 1/4, implies hausdor dimension branched polymer four. relevant length scale shorter correlation length, f 2(p) 1/p2 behaves like propagator massless scalar eld. let us consider following region: a0 x = a0n 1/4. (35) a0 gives ultraviolet cut-o whereas gives infrared cut-o length correlation functions damp rapidly. note that, region near critical point, following inequality holds: finally, consider correlation functions > 2. case two-point function, points xed tree graph. uniquely x path connecting graph. therefore, m-point function f represented summation tree diagrams xed points f 2 appear propagators. example, f 3(p, q) = (b/ f (0))2 f 2(p) f 2(q) f 2(p + q) +(b/ f (0))1, (37) see gure 5. however, inequality (36), diagrams maximum number propagators dominate. case 3-point function, rst term + + + f =^ 3 = figure 5: 3-point function f 3 summation tree diagrams whose propagators f 2. 6 1 1 1 bh(p) 1 1 b . (36) eq. (37) dominates. general, obtain naive result m-point correlation functions; f correlation functions massless 3 theory tree level. (38) next subsection, see naive results correspond correct thermodynamic results 2.4 correlation functions thermodynamic limit mentioned eq. (20), gm 0,l=0 equal f large n limit: gm 0,l=0(p1, , pm1) f m(p1, , pm1). (39) then, let us consider m-point correlation functions l 1. denition (11), obtained applying l-th derivative l = 0 case: gm 0,l(p1, , pm1) = (0 = ( 0 b 1 b )l gm 0,l=0(p1, , pm1) )l gm 0,l=0(p1, , pm1) b 2-point function l = 1 given g2 0,l=1(p) ( ) ( ) b 1 b2h(p) b 1 bh(p) 1 b (1 b)(1 bh(p))2 1 (1 b) 1 p4 . (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) here, used inequality (36) since interested correlation functions physical region (35) near critical point. behavior dierent g2 0,l=0 1/p2. similarly l > 1, behavior 2-point function becomes g2 0,l1(p) 1 1 (1 b)2l1 (1 bh(p))2 (1 b)2l1 1 p4 (45) (46) 1 1b , coincides l = 1 result. due inequality (36), derivative b dominated act 1 1bh(p). thus, p-dependences same. correct thermodynamic limit. is, consider grand canonical correlation function l 1, otherwise non-universal small n behavior aects summation cannot obtain universal result. note behavior g2 0,l1(p) 1/p4 consistent fact hausdor dimension branched polymer four. naive argument expected gure 4 eect branching absorbed renormalizing mass. so, propagator behaves random walks. discuss section 3 argument correct. 7 similarly, 3-point functions become g3 0,l=0(p, q) g(p)g(q)g(p + q), g3 0,l1(p, q) g(p)g(q)g(p + q) + g(p)g(q)g(p + q) + g(p)g(q)g(p + q), g(p) = g(p) = 1 1 p2 , 1 bh(p) (1 bh(p))2 1 1 p4 . (47) (48) (49) (50) note one propagator graph replaced g(p), since derivative dominated act factor m-point correlation functions, b 1 1b, case 2-point functions. therefore, gm 0,l=0 correlation functions 3 theory tree level (51) gm 0,l1 correlation functions 3 theory tree level mass insertion (52) correct correlation function thermodynamic limit given eq. (52), eq. (51). consistency check, following relation (m+1)-point function m-point function must hold: gm+1(p1, , pm1, pm = 0) = gm(p1, , pm1). (53) actually holds l.h.s. eq. (53), special class diagrams dominate m-th end point attached propagator g(pm). due inequality g(p = 0) g(p = 0). then, equal r.h.s. eq. (53). 3 conclusion discussion letter shown correlation functions branched polymers given 3 theory tree level single mass insertion correctly take thermodynamic limit. given 3 theory tree level themselves, widely believed. result interpreted follows. since 1-point function behaves large n (see eq. (15)), obtain relation; n n 3/2(e f (0))n g1 n z dn g1 g1 n g1 (n n ). (54) (55) relation reminds us situation two-dimensional quantum gravity (see, example, ). two dimensional quantum gravity known describe fractal space-time. 8 consists numerous tiny baby universes single mother universe. case, analogy means divide tree graph two cutting bond, nd nite points one points belong other. case m-point functions, single mother universe blob path connecting points. lets consider case two-point function simplest example. naively gure 4 implies propagator behaves simpler random walk blob equal footing. however one blobs gure 4 becomes mother universe consisting innitely many points entirely dierent blobs. therefore divide path two parts cutting mother universe. part considered propagator random walks whose weights dressed blobs. reason obtained propagator behaving 1/p4 instead 1/p2. words, mother universe (the blob innitely many points) corresponds mass insertion blobs renormalize correlation length random walks a0n 1/2 a0n 1/4. also apply similar argument higher-point functions. one blobs becomes mother universe, corresponds single mass insertion 3 scalar eld theory. acknowledgments would like thank dr. s. higuchi correspondence. work supported part grant-in-aid scientic research ministry education, science culture japan national science foundation grant no. phys94-07194. appendix appendix, derive canonical-ensemble partition function (6) schwinger- dyson equation (22). let us solve b form expansion . coecient calculated 1 2i i=0 b n +1 = = 1 2i ib=0 n n 1 . n! db(1 b)eb b (beb)n +1 hence, b = xn =1 n n 1 n! n . denitions (1), (19) (23), b expanded b = f (0) xn=1 n v zn n 0 . comparing two expansions, get result eq.
