i. introduction

over the past few years, a tremendous amount of progress has been made in the
understanding of strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge and string theories. these ad-
vances were driven in large part by the seiberg-witten solution of n = 2 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory for su (2) gauge group [1].

of central interest to many of these developments is the 4-dimensional supersymmetric
yang-mills theory with maximal supersymmetry, n = 4, and with arbitrary gauge algebra
g. in the present paper, we shall consider a generalization of this theory, in which a mass
term is added for part of the n = 4 gauge multiplet, softly breaking the n = 4 symmetry
to n = 2. as an n = 2 supersymmetric theory, the theory has a g-gauge multiplet, and
a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of g with mass m. this generalized theory
shares many of the properties of the n = 4 theory :
it has the same eld content; it is
ultra-violet nite; it has vanishing renormalization group -function, and it is expected to
have montonen-olive duality symmetry. for vanishing hypermultiplet mass m = 0, the
n = 4 theory is recovered. for m  , the limiting theory is one of many interesting
n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theories. the possibilities for, say, g = su (n ), include
theories with any number of hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of su (n ),
or with product gauge algebras su (n1)  su (n2)      su (np), and hypermultiplets
in the fundamental and bi-fundamental representations of these product algebras.

remarkably, the seiberg-witten theory for n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory
for arbitrary gauge algebra g appears to be intimately related with the existence of certain
classical mechanics integrable systems. this relation was rst suspected on the basis of
the similarity between the seiberg-witten curves and the spectral curves of certain inte-
grable models [2]. then, general arguments showed that seiberg-witten ansatz naturally
produces integrable structures [3]. for the n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with
massive hypermultiplet, the relevant integrable system appears to be the elliptic calogero-
moser system. for su (n ) gauge group, donagi and witten [3] proposed that the spectral
curves of the su (n ) hitchin system should play the role of the seiberg-witten curves.
krichever (in unpublished work), gorsky and nekrasov, and martinec [4] recognized that
the su (n ) hitchin system spectral curves are identical to those of the su (n ) elliptic
calogero-moser integrable system.

that the su (n ) elliptic calogero-moser curves (and associated seiberg-witten dif-
ferential) do indeed provide the seiberg-witten solution for the n = 2 theory with one
massive hypermultiplet was fully established by the authors in [5]. there, it was shown
that the eective prepotential f reproduces the logarithmic singularities predicted by per-
turbation theory; that f satises a renormalization group type equation which determines

2

instanton contributions to any order; and that the prepotential in the limit of large hyper-
multiplet mass m reproduces the prepotentials for n = 2 super yang-mills theory with
any number of hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of the gauge group.

the fundamental problem in seiberg-witten theory is to determine the seiberg-witten
curves and dierentials, corresponding to an n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory with
arbitrary gauge algebra g, and a massive hypermultiplet in an arbitrary representation r
of g, subject to the constraint of asymptotic freedom or conformal invariance. with the
correspondence between seiberg-witten curves and the spectral curves of classical mechan-
ics integrable systems [3], this problem is equivalent to determining a general integrable
system, associated with the lie algebra g and the representation r.

the n = 2 theory for arbitrary gauge algebra g and with one massive hypermultiplet
in the adjoint representation was one such outstanding case when g 6= su (n ). actually, as
discussed previously, upon taking suitable limits, this theory contains a very large number
of models with smaller hypermultiplet representations r, and in this sense has a univer-
sal aspect. it appeared dicult to generalize directly the donagi-witten construction of
hitchin systems to arbitrary g, and it was thus natural to seek this generalization directly
amongst the elliptic calogero-moser integrable systems. it has been known now for a long
time, thanks to the work of olshanetsky and perelomov [6], that calogero-moser systems
can be dened for any simple lie algebra. olshanetsky and perelomov also showed that the
calogero-moser systems for classical lie algebras were integrable, although the existence
of a spectral curve (or lax pair with spectral parameter) as well as the case of exceptional
lie algebras remained open.

the purpose of this paper is to review the resolution of the above problems by the

following results which were obtained in [7], [8], [9].

 the elliptic calogero-moser systems dened by an arbitrary simple lie algebra g

admit lax pairs with spectral parameters.

 the correspondence between elliptic g calogero-moser systems and n = 2 super-
symmetric g gauge theories with matter in the adjoint representation holds directly when
the lie algebra g is simply-laced. when g is not simply-laced, the correspondence is with
new integrable models, the twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems introduced in [7,8].

 twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems admit a lax pair with spectral parame-

ter [7].

the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. in ii, we review the set-up and
basic constructions of seiberg-witten theory. in iii, we discuss the elliptic calogero-moser
systems, and present the new twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems introduced in [7,8].
in iv, we show how these systems tend to toda systems in certain limits. in v, we discuss
their integrability properties and present their lax pairs with spectral parameter. finally,
in vi, we discuss the seiberg-witten solution for the n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills
theories and a massive hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of an arbitrary gauge
algebra g. a prior review of these results has appeared in [10], where further results on
spin calogero-moser systems are also presented.

ii. seiberg-witten theory

the starting point for seiberg-witten theory is an n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills
theory with gauge algebra g and hypermultiplets in a representation r of g with masses
mj. the microscopic lagrangian is completely xed by n = 2 supersymmetry in terms of
the gauge coupling g and the instanton angle , and is given by

l =

1
4g2 f a

 f a +


322 f a



f a + d d + tr[ , ]2 +   

(2.1)

where we have neglected hypermultiplet and fermion terms.

the low energy eective theory corresponding to this model can be analyzed by study-
ing rst the structure of the vacuum. n = 2 supersymmetric vacuum states can occur
whenever the vacuum energy is exactly zero, which is achieved for constant scalar elds 
for which the potential energy term vanishes. this requires [ , ] = 0, so that the vacuum
expectation value of  is a linear combination of the cartan generators hj of the gauge
algebra g,

n

<  >=

ajhj

n = rank g

(2.2)

here, the complex parameters aj are usually referred to as the quantum moduli, or also
as the quantum order parameters of the n = 2 vacua.

for generic values of the parameters aj, the g-gauge symmetry will be broken down
to u (1)n/weyl(g), and the low energy theory is that of n dierent coulomb elds, up to
global identications by weyl(g). the low energy eective lagrangian is invariant under
n = 2 supersymmetry and thus given by

leective =

im(ij)f i

re(ij)f i


f j +  jdj + fermions

(2.3)

here, the dual gauge scalar d and the gauge coupling function ij are both given in terms
of the prepotential f

xj=1

dj =

f ()

j

ij =

2f ()

(2.4)

the form of the eective lagrangian (2.3) is the same for any of the values of the complex
moduli of n = 2 vacua, with the understanding that the elds j take on the expectation
value < j >= aj. since the prepotential f () is a function of the elds  only, but
not of derivatives of , the prepotential will be completely determined by its values on
the vacuum expectation values of the eld, namely by its values on the quantum order
parameters aj.

the object of seiberg-witten theory is the determination of the prepotential f (aj),
from which the entire low energy eective action will be known. this is achieved by
exploiting the physical conditions satised by f [1],

(1) f (aj) is complex analytic in aj in view of n = 2 supersymmetry.
(2) the matrix im ij = im ijf is positive denite, since by (2.3), it coincides with the

metric on the kinetic terms for the gauge elds aj.

(3) the large aj behavior is known from perturbative quantum eld theory calculations

and asymptotic freedom, and is given by f (a)  p(  a)2 ln(  a)2 pw(w  a +

m)2 ln(w  a + m)2, where  and w are respectively the roots of g and the weights of
the representation r.

as a result of (1) and (2), f cannot be a single-valued function of the aj. for if it
were, im ij would be both harmonic and bounded from below, implying that it must be
independent of aj. but from (3) we know that ij is neither constant nor single valued.
the multiple-value ambiguity does not aect the physics of the low energy eective action
since it may be related to electric-magnetic duality, as shown by seiberg and witten [1].

a natural setting in which the above monodromy problem may be solved is provided
by families of riemann surfaces, called the seiberg-witten spectral curves, denoted by
. indeed, letting the quantum moduli aj correspond to moduli of the riemann surfaces,
there is automatically a complex analytic period matrix, whose imaginary part is positive
denite, and whose monodromy group corresponds to the modular group of the surface.
the general set-up of the seiberg-witten solution, expected for arbitrary gauge algebra g
with rank n and general hypermultiplet representation is as follows.

(1) the seiberg-witten curve is a family of riemann surfaces (u1,    , un) dependent on
n auxiliary complex parameters uj, which are related to the quantum moduli aj. the
seiberg-witten curve will also depend upon the gauge coupling g and -angle and on
the hypermultiplet masses mk.

(2) the seiberg-witten dierential 1-form d is meromorphic on , with residues which
are linear in the hypermultiplet masses mk. since the hypermultiplet masses receive no
quantum corrections as aj varies, the derivatives (d)/aj are holomorphic 1-forms.

for a suitable set of cycles aj and bj on .

shortly after the initial work of seiberg and witten, curves and dierentials were
proposed for a general classical gauge group, with and without hypermultiplets in the
fundamental representation. use was made of the r-charge assignments of the elds, the
singularity structure of the degenerations of the seiberg-witten curve and much educated
guess work (see e.g.
[11] for reviews). the monodromies and instanton corrections in
the corresponding prepotential were determined in [31]. more recently, seiberg-witten
curves for many other theories have been found, based on integrable models [12-14], m-
theory [15], and geometric engineering [16]. monodromies and instanton corrections have
been determined in several important cases, including for the su (n ) gauge theory, with
hypermultiplet in the symmetric or anti-symmetric representation [17]. the prepotential
has also been analyzed using methods from whitham theory [18, 30] and wdvv equations
[19].

iii. twisted and untwisted calogero-moser systems

a) the su (n ) elliptic calogero-moser system

the original elliptic calogero-moser system is the system dened by the hamiltonian

(3.1)

here m is a mass parameter, and (z) is the weierstrass -function, dened on a torus
c/(21z + 22z). as usual, we denote by  = 2/1 the moduli of the torus, and set
q = e2i . the well-known trigonometric and rational limits with respective potentials

arise in the limits 1 = i, 2   and 1, 2  . all these systems have been shown
to be completely integrable in the sense of liouville, i.e. they all admit a complete set of
integrals of motion which are in involution [20-22]. for a recent review of some applications
of these models see [23].

6

our considerations require however a notion of integrability which is in some sense
more stringent, namely the existence of a lax pair l(z), m (z) with spectral parameter z.
such a lax pair was obtained by krichever [24] in 1980. he showed that the hamiltonian
system (3.1) is equivalent to the lax equation l(z) = [l(z), m (z)], with l(z) and m (z)
given by the following n  n matrices

lij(z) =piij  m(1  ij)(xi  xj, z)

mij(z) =mijxk6=i

the function (x, z) is dened by

(xi  xk)  m(1  ij)(xi  xj, z).

(3.2)

(x, z) =

(z  x)
(z)(x)

ex(z),

(3.3)

where (z), (z) are the usual weierstrass  and  functions on the torus c/(21z+22z).
the function (x, z) satises the key functional equation

(x, z)(y, z)  (y, z)(x, z) = ((x)  (y))(x + y, z).

(3.4)

it is well-known that functional equations of this form are required for the hamilton
equations of motion to be equivalent to the lax equation l(z) = [l(z), m (z)] with a lax
pair of the form (3.2). it is a relatively recent result of braden and buchstaber [25] that,
conversely, general functional equations of the form (3.4) essentially determine (x, z).

b) calogero-moser systems dened by lie algebras

olshanetsky and perelomov [6] showed that the hamiltonian system (3.1) is only
one of a series associated with each simple lie algebra. given any simple lie algebra g,
olshanetsky and perelomov [6] introduced the system with hamiltonian

h(x, p) =

1
2

r

xi=1

p2
i 

1

2 xr(g)

m2

||(  x),

(3.5)

where r is the rank of g, r(g) denotes the set of roots of g, and the m|| are mass
parameters. to preserve the invariance of (3.5) under the weyl group, the parameters
m|| depend only on the orbit || of the root , and not on the root  itself. in the case of
an1 = su (n ), it is common practice to use n pairs of dynamical variables (xi, pi), since
the roots of an1 lie conveniently on a hyperplane in cn . the dynamics of the system
are unaected if we shift all xi by a constant, and the number of degrees of freedom is
eectively n  1 = r. now the roots of su (n ) are given by  = ei  ej , 1  i, j  n ,
i 6= j. thus we recognize the original elliptic calogero-moser system as the special case of

7

(3.5) corresponding to an1. olshanetsky and perelomov constructed a lax pair for all
these systems with classical lie algebras, without spectral parameter [6].

c) twisted calogero-moser systems dened by lie algebras

it turns out that the hamiltonian systems (3.5) are not the only natural extensions
of the basic elliptic calogero-moser system. a subtlety arises for simple lie algebras g
which are not simply-laced, i.e., algebras which admit roots of uneven length. this is the
case for the algebras bn, cn, g2, and f4 in cartans classication. for these algebras, the
following twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems were introduced by the authors in [7,8]

h twisted =

1
2

r

xi=1

p2
i 

1

2 xr(g)

m2

||()(  x).

(3.6)

here the function () depends only on the length of the root . if g is simply-laced, we
set () = 1 identically. otherwise, for g non simply-laced, we set () = 1 when  is a
long root, () = 2 when  is a short root and g is one of the algebras bn, cn, or f4, and
() = 3 when  is a short root and g = g2. the twisted weierstrass function  (z) is
dened by

 (z) =

(z + 2a




),

(3.7)

1

x=0

where a is any of the half-periods 1, 2, or 1 + 2. thus the twisted and untwisted
calogero-moser systems coincide for g simply laced. the original motivation for twisted
calogero-moser systems was based on their scaling limits (which will be discussed in the
next section) [7,8]. another motivation based on the symmetries of dynkin diagrams was
proposed subsequently by bordner, sasaki, and takasaki [26].

iv. scaling limits of calogero-moser systems

a) results of inozemtsev for an1

for the standard elliptic calogero-moser systems corresponding to an1, inozemtsev

[27] has shown in the 1980s that in the scaling limit

m = m q 1

2n ,

q  0

xi = xi  22

i
n

,

1  i  n

(4.1)

where m is kept xed, the elliptic an1 calogero-moser hamiltonian tends to the following
hamiltonian

htoda =

n

p2
i 

xi=1

n1

2(cid:0)

xi=1

exi+1xi + ex1xn(cid:1)

8

(4.2)

the roots ei  ei+1, 1  i  n  1, and en  e1 can be recognized as the simple roots of
the ane algebra a(1)
n1. (for basic facts on ane algebras, we refer to [28]). thus (4.2)
can be recognized as the hamiltonian of the toda system dened by a(1)

n1.

b) scaling limits based on the coxeter number

the key feature of the above scaling limit is the collapse of the sum over the entire
root lattice of an1 in the calogero-moser hamiltonian to the sum over only simple roots
in the toda hamiltonian for the kac-moody algebra a(1)
n1. our task is to extend this
mechanism to general lie algebras. for this, we consider the following generalization of
the preceding scaling limit

2 ,

m = m q 1
x = x  22,

(4.3)

here x = (xi), x = (xi) and  are r-dimensional vectors. the vector x is the dynamical
variable of the calogero-moser system. the parameters  and  depend on the algebra
g and are yet to be chosen. as for m and x, they have the same interpretation as
earlier, namely as respectively the mass parameter and the dynamical variables of the
limiting system. setting 1 = i, the contribution of each root  to the calogero-moser
potential can be expressed as

m2(  x) =

1

m 2

it suces to consider positive roots . we shall also assume that 0       1. the
contributions of the n = 0 and n = 1 summands in (4.4) are proportional to e22( )
and e22(1+ ) respectively. thus the existence of a nite scaling limit requires that
       1  . let i, 1  i  r be a basis of simple roots for g. if we want all simple
roots i to survive in the limit, we must require that i   = 1, 1  i  r. this condition
characterizes the vector  as the level vector. next, the second condition in (3.7) can be
rewritten as {1 + max (  )}  1. but

hg = 1 + max (  )

(4.5)

is precisely the coxeter number of g, and we must have   1
, the
hg
contributions of all the roots except for the simple roots of g tend to 0. on the other hand,
when  = 1
, the highest root 0 realizing the maximum over  in (4.5) survives. since
hg
0 is the additional simple root for the ane lie algebra g(1), we arrive in this way at
the following theorem, which was proved in [8]

. thus when  < 1
hg

theorem 1. under the limit (4.4-4.5), with  = 1
, and  given by the level vector, the
hg
hamiltonian of the elliptic calogero-moser system for the simple lie algebra g tends to
the hamiltonian of the toda system for the ane lie algebra g(1).

9

(c) scaling limit based on the dual coxeter number

if the seiberg-witten spectral curve of the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory with
a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation is to be realized as the spectral curve for a
calogero-moser system, the parameter m in the calogero-moser system should correspond
to the mass of the hypermultiplet. in the gauge theory, the dependence of the coupling
constant on the mass m is given by

 =

i
2

h
g ln

m2
m 2



m = m q

 1
2h
g

(4.6)

where h
g is the quadratic casimir of the lie algebra g. this shows that the correct
physical limit, expressing the decoupling of the hypermultiplet as it becomes innitely
massive, is given by (4.3), but with  = 1
. to establish a closer parallel with our preceding
h
g
discussion, we recall that the quadratic casimir h
g coincides with the dual coxeter number
of g, dened by

where  = 2

h
g = 1 + max (  ),
2 is the coroot associated to , and  = 1

(4.7)

2p>0  is the weyl vector.

for simply-laced lie algebras g (ade algebras), we have hg = h

g , and the preceding
scaling limits apply. however, for non simply-laced algebras (bn, cn, g2, f4), we have
hg > h
g , and our earlier considerations show that the untwisted elliptic calogero-moser
hamiltonians do not tend to a nite limit under (4.6), q  0, m is kept xed. this is
why the twisted hamiltonian systems (3.6) have to be introduced. the twisting produces
precisely an improvement in the asymptotic behavior of the potential which allows a nite,
non-trivial limit. more precisely, we can write

m2 (x) =

2
2



xn=

m2

ch (x  2n2)  1

.

(4.8)

setting x = x  22, we obtain the following asymptotics

m2 (x) = 2m 2(cid:26) e22()x + e22(1)+x ,

e22()x,

if  is long;
if  is short.

this leads to the following theorem [8]

g , with  the weyl vector and
theorem 2. under the limit x = x + 22
q  0, the hamiltonian of the twisted elliptic calogero-moser system for the simple lie
algebra g tends to the hamiltonian of the toda system for the ane lie algebra (g(1)).

similar arguments show that the lax pairs constructed below also have nite, non-

trivial scaling limits whenever this is the case for the hamiltonians.

v. lax pairs for calogero-moser systems

a) the general ansatz

let the rank of g be n, and d be its dimension. let  be a representation of g of
dimension n , of weights i , 1  i  n . let ui  cn be the weights of the fundamental
representation of gl(n, c). project orthogonally the ui s onto the i s as

sui = i + ui ,

i  vj .

(5.1)

it is easily veried that s2 is the second dynkin index. then ij = i  j is a weight
of    associated to the root ui  uj of gl(n, c). the lax pairs for both untwisted
and twisted calogero-moser systems will be of the form

l = p + x, m = d + x,

(5.2)

where the matrices p, x, d, and y are given by

x = xi6=j

cij ij (ij , z)eij , y =xi6=j

cij 

ij (ij , z)eij

(5.3a)

and by

p = p  h, d = d  (h  h) + .

(5.3b)

here h is in a cartan subalgebra hg for g, h is in the cartan-killing orthogonal comple-
ment of hg inside a cartan subalgebra h for gl(n, c), and  is in the centralizer of hg
in gl(n, c). the functions ij (x, z) and the coecients cij are yet to be determined.
we begin by stating the necessary and sucient conditions for the pair l(z), m (z) of
(5.2) to be a lax pair for the (twisted or untwisted) calogero-moser systems. for this, it
is convenient to introduce the following notation

ij = ij (ij  x)

ij = ij (ij  x, z)

ji(ij  x, z)  ij (ij  x, z)

ji(ij  x, z).

(5.4)

then the lax equation l(z) = [l(z), m (z)] implies the calogero-moser system if and

only if the following three identities are satised

xi6=j

cij cji 

ij ij = s2 xr(g)

(5.5c)

the following theorem was established in [7]:

theorem 3. a representation , functions ij , and coecients cij with a spectral
parameter z satisfying (5.5a-c) can be found for all twisted and untwisted elliptic calogero-
moser systems associated with a simple lie algebra g, except possibly in the case of twisted
g2. in the case of e8, we have to assume the existence of a 1 cocycle.

b) lax pairs for untwisted calogero-moser systems

we now describe some important features of the lax pairs we obtain in this manner.

all have an independent spectral parameter.

 in the case of the untwisted calogero-moser systems, we can choose ij (x, z) =

(x, z), ij (x) = (x) for all g. one also has  = 0 for all g, except for e8.

 for an, the lax pair (5.2-5.3) may correspond to any of the totally antisymmetric

representations, including the fundamental one.

 for the bcn system, the lax pair is obtained by imbedding bn in gl(n, c) with
n = 2n + 1. when z = a (half-period), the lax pair obtained this way reduces to that
of olshanetsky and perelomov [6].

 for the bn and dn systems, additional lax pairs are found by taking  to be the

spinor representation.

 for g2, a lax pair is obtained in the representation 7 while another one is gotten

by restricting the 8 of b3 to the 7  1 of g2.

 for f4, a lax pair can be obtained by taking  to be the 26  1 of f4, viewed as

the restriction of the 27 of e6 to its f4 subalgebra.

 for e6,  is the 27 representation.

 for e7,  is the 56 representation.

 for e8, a lax pair with spectral parameter can be constructed with  given by the

248 representation, if coecients cij = 1 exist with the following cocycle conditions

c(,   )c(  , ) =c(,  + )c( + , )

when    =    = 1,    = 0

12

c(, )c(  , ) =c(,   )

when    =    = 1,    = 0

c(, )c(,   ) =  c(  , )

when    = 1.

(5.6a)

the matrix  in the lax pair is then the 8  8 matrix given by

m2

m2

b=1

ab = xa=1
 xa=1
aa = xa=1

b=1

2 (cid:0)c(a, )c(, b) + c(a, a  )c(a  , b)(cid:1)(  x)

2 (cid:0)c(a, )c(, b) + c(a, a  )c(a  , b)(cid:1)(  x)

m2(  x) + 2m2(a  x),

(5.6b)

where a, 1  a  8, is a maximal set of 8 mutually orthogonal roots.

 explicit expressions for the constants cij and the functions d(x), and thus for the
lax pair are particularly simple when the representation  consists of only a single weyl
orbit of weights. this is the case when  is either

(1) the dening representation of an, cn or dn;
(2) any rank p totally anti-symmetric representation of an;
(3) an irreducible fundamental spinor representation of bn or dn;
(4) the 27 of e6;
(5) the 56 of e7.

then the weights  and  of  provide unique labels instead of i and j, and the

values of cij = c are given by a simple formula

the expression for the vector d may be summarized by

2 m|| when  =    is a root

c =

(5.8)

(for cn, the last equation has an additional term, as given in [7].) in each case, the number
of independent couplings m|| equals the number of dierent root lengths.

c) lax pairs for twisted calogero-moser systems

13

recall that the twisted and untwisted calogero-moser systems dier only for non-
simply laced lie algebras, namely bn, cn, g2 and f4. these are the only algebras we
discuss in this paragraph. the construction (5.2-5.5) gives then lax pairs for all of them,
with the possible exception of twisted g2. unlike the case of untwisted lie algebras
however, the functions ij have to be chosen with care, and dier for each algebra. more
specically,

 for bn, the lax pair is of dimension n = 2n, admits two independent couplings m1

and m2, and

ij (x, z) =(cid:26) (x, z),

2( 1

2 x, z),

if i  j 6= 0, n
if i  j = n

.

here a new function 2(x, z) is dened by

2(

1
2

x, z) =

( 1

2 x, z)( 1

2 x + 1, z)

(1, z)

(5.9)

(5.10)

 for cn, the lax pair is of dimension n = 2n + 2, admits one independent coupling

m2, and

where ij are given by

ij (x, z) = 2(x + ij , z),

ij =( 0,

2,
2,

if i 6= j = 1, 2,    , 2n + 1;
if 1  i  2n, j = 2n + 2;
if 1  j  2n, i = 2n + 2.

(5.11)

 for f4, the lax pair is of dimension n = 24, admits two independent couplings m1

and m2,

(x, z) =


(x, z),
1(x, z),
2( 1
2 x, z),

if    = 0;
if    = 1
2 ;
if    = 1.

(5.12)

where the function 1(x, z) is dened by

1(x, z) = (x, z)  ei(z)+1z(x + 1, z)

(5.13)

here it is more convenient to label the entries of the lax pair directly by the weights
 = i and  = j instead of i and j.

 for g2, there are natural candidates for lax pairs in the 6 and 8 representations
of g2, but it is still unknown whether elliptic functions ij (x, z) exist which satisfy the
required identities.

we note that recently lax pairs of root type have been considered [21] which cor-
respond, in the above ansatz (5.3-5), to  equal to the adjoint representation of g and

14

the coecients cij vanishing for i or j associated with zero weights. this choice yields
another lax pair for the case of e8.

vi. calogero-moser and seiberg-witten theory

the correspondence between seiberg-witten theory for n = 2 super-yang-mills the-
ory with one hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge algebra, and the el-
liptic calogero-moser systems was rst established in [5], for the gauge algebra g = su (n ).
we describe it here in some detail.

a) the case of g = su (n )

all that we shall need here of the elliptic calogero-moser system is its lax operator

l(z), whose n  n matrix elements are given by

lij(z) = piij  m(1  ij)(xi  xj, z)

(6.1)

2 trl(z)2 + c(z)
2 m2n (n  1). the correspondence between the data of the elliptic calogero-

notice that the hamiltonian is simply given in terms of l by h(x, p) = 1
with c =  1
moser system and those of the seiberg-witten theory is as follows.
(1) the parameter m in (6.1) is the hypermultiplet mass;
(2) the gauge coupling g and the -angle are related to the modulus of the torus  =

c/(21z + 22z) by

 =

2
1

=


2

+

4i
g2 ;

(6.2)

(3) the seiberg-witten curve  is the spectral curve of the elliptic calogero-moser model,

 = {(k, z)  c  , det(cid:0)ki  l(z)(cid:1) = 0}

(6.3)

the seiberg-witten form is d = k dz.  is invariant under the weyl group of su (n ).
(4) using the lax equation l = [l, m ], it is clear that the spectral curve is independent
of time, and can be dependent only upon the constants of motion of the calogero-
moser system, of which there are only n . these integrals of motion may be viewed
as parametrized by the quantum moduli of the seiberg-witten system.

(5) finally, d = kdz is meromorphic, with a simple pole on each of the n sheets above
the point z = 0 on the base torus. the residue at each of these poles is proportional
to m, as required by the general set-up of seiberg-witten theory, explained in ii.

b) four fundamental results for the case of g = su (n )

while the above mappings of the seiberg-witten data onto the calogero-moser data is
certainly natural, there is no direct proof of it, and it is important to check that the results

15

inferred from it agree with known facts from quantum eld theory. to establish this, as
well as a series of further predictions from the correspondence, we give four theorems (the
proofs may be found in [5] for the rst three theorems, and in [29] for the last one).

theorem 4. the spectral curve equation det(ki  l(z)) = 0 is equivalent to

1(cid:18) 1

21

(z  m


k

)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:19)h(k) = 0

(6.4)

where h(k) is a monic polynomial in k of degree n , whose zeros (or equivalently whose

coecients) correspond to the moduli of the gauge theory. if h(k) =qn

i=1(k  ki), then

lim

2iiai

kdz = ki

here, 1 is the jacobi -function, which admits a simple series expansion in powers of the
instanton factor q = e2i , so that the curve equation may also be rewritten as a series
expansion

1

2 n(n1)enzh(k  n  m) = 0

(6.5)

()nq

xnz

where we have set 1 = i without loss of generality.

theorem 5. the prepotential of the seiberg-witten theory obeys a renormalization group-
type equation that simply relates f to the calogero-moser hamiltonian, expressed in terms
of the quantum order parameters aj

aj =

2iiaj

d

f

 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)aj

= h(x, p) =

1
2

trl(z)2 + c(z)

(6.6)

furthermore, in an expansion in powers of the instanton factor q = e2i , the quantum
order parameters aj may be computed by residue methods in terms of the zeros of h(k).

the proof of (6.6) requires riemann surface deformation theory [5]. the fact that the
quantum order parameters may be evaluated by residue methods arises from the fact that
aj-cycles may be chosen on the spectral curve  in such a way that they will shrink to
zero as q  0. as a result, contour integrals around full-edged branch cuts aj reduce
to contour integrals around poles at single points, which may be calculated by residue
methods only. these methods were originally developed in [30,31]. knowing the quantum
order parameters in terms of the zeros kj of h(k) = 0 is a relation which may be inverted
and used in (6.6) to obtain a dierential relation for all order instanton corrections. it is
now only necessary to evaluate explicitly the  -independent contribution to f , which in

16

eld theory arises from perturbation theory. this may be done easily by retaining only the
n = 0 and n = 1 terms in the expansion of the curve (6.5), so that z = ln h(k)ln h(km).
the results of the calculations to two instanton order may be summarized in the following
theorem [5].

theorem 6. the prepotential, to 2 instanton order is given by f = f (pert) + f (1) + f (2).
the perturbative contribution is given by

f (pert) =

a2
i 



2 xi

1

8ixi,j (cid:20)(ai aj)2 ln(ai aj)2 (ai aj m)2 ln(ai aj m)2(cid:21) (6.7a)

while all instanton corrections are expressed in terms of a single function

si(a) = qn

j=1(cid:2)(ai  aj)2  m2(cid:3)
qj6=i(a  aj)2

q

si(ai)

si(ai)sj(aj)
(ai  aj)2 

si(ai)sj(aj)

(ai  aj  m)2(cid:21)

(6.7b)

(6.7c)

the perturbative corrections to the prepotential of (6.7a) indeed precisely agree with the
predictions of asymptotic freedom. the formulas (6.7c) for the instanton corrections f (1)
and f (2) are new, as they have not yet been computed by direct eld theory methods.
perturbative expansions of the prepotential in powers of m have also been obtained in [32].
within the context of topological gauge theory, these results on the prepotential have been
used in [33].

the moduli ki, 1  i  n , of the gauge theory are evidently integrals of motion of
the system. to identify these integrals of motion, denote by s any subset of {1,    , n },
and let s = {1,    , n } \ s, (s) = (xi  xj) when s = {i, j}. let also ps denote the
subset of momenta pi with i  s, and k(ps) the k-th symmetric polynomial in pi, i  s.
we have [29]

theorem 7. for any k, 0  k  n , let k (k1,    , kn ) = k (k) be the k-th symmetric

polynomial of (k1,    , kn ), dened by h(u) =pn

[k/2]

k=0()k k(k)unk . then

(6.8)

we note that an alternative derivation of (6.4) was recently presented in [34]. the
parametrization (6.4) has also been extended to the spectral curves of spin calogero-moser
systems in [10]. for spin calogero-moser systems with l internal degrees of freedom, we
can write

det(i  l(z)) =

,

| )

(6.9)

where hp(k) is a polynomial of degree n  p + 1, 1  p  l, h1(k) is monic, and hp(k)
has no term of order k0.

c) the case of general gauge algebra g

we consider now the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory for a general simple gauge

algebra g and a hypermultiplet of mass m in the adjoint representation. then [9]

 the seiberg-witten curve of the theory is given by the spectral curve  = {(k, z) 
c  ; det(ki  l(z)) = 0} of the twisted elliptic calogero-moser system associated to the
lie algebra g. the seiberg-witten dierential d is given by d = kdz.

 the function r(k, z) = det(ki  l(z)) is polynomial in k and meromorphic in z.
the spectral curve  is invariant under the weyl group of g. it depends on n complex
moduli, which can be thought of as independent integrals of motion of the calogero-moser
system.

 the dierential d = kdz is meromorphic on , with simple poles. the position
and residues of the poles are independent of the moduli. the residues are linear in the
hypermultiplet mass m.
(unlike the case of su (n ), their exact values are dicult to
determine for general g).

 in the m  0 limit, the calogero-moser system reduces to a free system, the spectral
curve  is just the product of several unglued copies of the base torus , indexed by the
constant eigenvalues of l(z) = p  h. let ki, 1  i  n, be n independent eigenvalues, and
ai, bi be the a and b cycles lifted to the corresponding sheets. for each i, we readily
obtain

thus the prepotential f is given by f = 
i . this is the classical prepotential
and hence the correct answer, since in the m  0 limit, the theory acquires an n = 4
supersymmetry, and receives no quantum corrections.

 the m   limit is the crucial consistency check, which motivated the introduction
of the twisted calogero-moser systems in the rst place [7,8]. in view of theorem 2 and
 1
2h
g

subsequent comments, in the limit m  , q  0, with x = x + 22
with x and m kept xed, the hamiltonian and spectral curve for the twisted elliptic
calogero-moser system with lie algebra g reduce to the hamiltonian and spectral curve
for the toda system for the ane lie algebra (g(1)). this is the correct answer. indeed,
in this limit, the gauge theory with adjoint hypermultiplet reduces to the pure yang-mills
theory, and the seiberg-witten spectral curves for pure yang-mills with gauge algebra g
have been shown by martinec and warner [35] to be the spectral curves of the toda system
for (g(1)).

 the equations r(k, z) = det(ki  l(z)) for the spectral curves of g = dn can be

the eective prepotential can be evaluated explicitly in the case of g = dn for n  5.
its logarithmic singularity does reproduce the logarithmic singularities expected from eld
theory considerations.

 as in the known correspondences between seiberg-witten theory and integrable

models [5,30], we expect the following equation to hold

f


= h twisted

g

(x, p),

(6.11)

to hold. note that the left hand side can be interpreted in the gauge theory as a renor-
malization group equation.

 for simply-laced g, the curves r(k, z) = 0 are modular invariant. physically, the
gauge theories for these lie algebras are self-dual. for non simply-laced g, the modular
group is broken to the congruence subgroup 0(2) for g = bn, cn, f4, and to 0(3) for
g2. the hamiltonians of the twisted calogero-moser systems for non-simply laced g
are also transformed under landen transformations into the hamiltonians of the twisted
calogero-moser system for the dual algebra g.
it would be interesting to determine

19

whether such transformations exist for the spectral curves or the corresponding gauge
theories themselves.

spectral curves for certain gauge theories with classical gauge algebras and matter in
the adjoint representation have also been proposed in [15] (see in particular the papers by
witten, uranga, and yokono), based on branes in string theory and m-theory. connections
between branes congurations associated with n = 2 gauge theories and integrable systems
have been put forward in [36].
