abstract

we study static spherically symmetric dyonic black holes in einstein-yang-
mills-higgs theory. as for the magnetic non-abelian black holes, the domain of
existence of the dyonic non-abelian black holes is limited with respect to the
horizon radius and the dimensionless coupling constant , which is proportional
to the ratio of vector meson mass and planck mass. at a certain critical value
of this coupling constant, , the maximal horizon radius is attained. we derive
analytically a relation between  and the charge of the black hole solutions and
conrm this relation numerically. besides the fundamental dyonic non-abelian
black holes, we study radially excited dyonic non-abelian black holes and globally
regular gravitating dyons.

1 introduction

su(2) yang-mills-higgs (ymh) theory, with the higgs eld in the adjoint represen-
tation, possesses globally regular particle-like solutions, such as the t hooft-polyakov
magnetic monopole [1] and the julia-zee dyon, which carries both magnetic and electric
charge [2].

in su(2) einstein-yang-mills-higgs (eymh) theory, for small gravitational con-
stant the gravitating fundamental monopole [3, 4, 5] and the gravitating fundamental
dyon [6] emerge smoothly from the corresponding at space solutions. the mass of the
gravitating fundamental monopole [4, 5] and dyon [6] solutions decreases with increas-
ing gravitational constant, corresponding to increasing coupling constant , which is
proportional to the ratio of vector meson mass and planck mass. the regular solutions
cease to exist beyond some maximal value of , depending on the electric charge q
[4, 5, 6].

besides these globally regular solutions, in su(2) eymh theory magnetic [4, 5, 7, 8]
and dyonic [6] non-abelian black hole solutions exist. they emerge from the globally
regular solutions, when a nite regular event horizon xh is imposed. consequently, they
have been characterized as black holes within magnetic monopoles [4] or black holes
within dyons [6]. distinct from the corresponding embedded reissner-nordstrm (rn)
black holes [9], these non-abelian black hole solutions represent counterexamples to the
no-hair conjecture, because they carry non-trivial non-coulomb-like elds outside
their horizon.
in contrast, pure su(2) eym theory possesses neither regular dyon
solutions [10], nor dyonic black holes other than embedded rn solutions [11, 12].

the magnetic non-abelian black holes exist only in a limited domain of the   xh
plane [4, 5, 7]. the domain of existence consists of two regimes, where for xed coupling
constant  and varying horizon radius xh, the solutions approach limiting solutions in
two distinct ways. at the transition point between these two regimes, given by the
critical value , the maximal horizon radius is attained [5, 7]. we here determine the
domain of existence of the dyonic non-abelian black holes, nding also two regimes for
the coupling constant .

besides the fundamental gravitating monopole and dyon solutions there are radi-
ally excited solutions [5, 7, 6], where the gauge eld function possesses nodes. both
the radially excited monopole and dyon solutions are related to the globally regular
einstein-yang-mills (eym) solutions, found by bartnik and mckinnon [13], and, like
these solutions, have no at space counterparts. besides the radially excited globally
regular dyon solutions, we here consider the radially excited dyonic non-abelian black
hole solutions and determine their domain of existence.

in section ii we derive the eymh equations of motion. we present the equations
both in schwarzschild-like coordinates, employed in the numerical calculations [6], and
in isotropic coordinates, to extend the analytical calculations [7] to the dyonic case. in

2

section iii we briey review the embedded rn solutions. we discuss the globally regular
dyon solutions in section iv. in addition to vanishing higgs self-coupling, we consider
the fundamental solutions also for nite higgs self-coupling, in order to demonstrate
that, as in at space [14], a maximally possible charge qmax arises. in section v we
discuss the dyonic non-abelian black hole solutions. in particular, we derive the critical
value  for the dyonic solutions analytically and conrm it numerically. for vanishing
higgs self-coupling, we determine the domain of existence for the fundamental and the
rst radially excited dyonic non-abelian black hole solutions, and we discuss the pattern
how the black hole solutions approach limiting solutions. we conclude in section vi.
in appendix a, nally we show the local existence of the non-abelian regular dyon and
dyonic black hole solutions at the origin and at the horizon, respectively.

g is the gauge coupling constant,  is the dimensionless higgs coupling constant, pro-
portional to the ratio of higgs boson mass and vector boson mass, and v is the higgs
eld vacuum expectation value. variation of the action eq. (1) with respect to the
metric g, the gauge eld aa
 and the higgs eld a leads to the einstein equations
and the matter eld equations.

2.1 ansatz

for static spherically symmetric globally regular and black hole solutions the metric
can be parametrized as [7, 15]

ds2 = gdxdx = e2(r)dt2 + e2(r)dr2 + r2(r)(d2 + sin2 d2) .

(6)

for the gauge and higgs eld we employ the spherically symmetric ansatz [6]

~at = ~erj(r)v ,

~ar = 0 ,

~a = ~e

1  k(r)

(11)

2.2 schwarzschild-like coordinates

we rst employ schwarzschild-like coordinates, corresponding to the gauge r(r) = r.
renaming r = r, the spherically symmetric metric reads

ds2 = a2ndt2 + n 1dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2) ,

with the metric functions

a(r) = e+ ,

n(r) = 1 

2m(r)

r

= e2 ,

(12)

(13)

(14)

and the mass function m(r).

we now introduce the dimensionless coordinate x and the dimensionless mass func-

tion ,

x = gvr ,  = gvm ,

(15)

4

as well as the dimensionless coupling constant 

2 = 4gv2 .

(16)

the tt and rr components of the einstein equations then yield the equations for

the metric functions,

(22)

where the prime now indicates the derivative with respect to x. for the matter functions
we obtain the equations

and

(x2anh ) = ah(cid:16)2k 2 + 2x2(h 2  1)(cid:17) .

introducing the new function

p =

j
a

and using eq. (18), we see that the metric function a can be eliminated from the set of
equations (17), (19)-(21). these can then be solved separately, with the metric function
a being determined subsequently by (18).

in the following we refer to the above set of functions, variables and parameters,

also employed in [6], as notation i.

2.3

isotropic coordinates

to make contact with the analytical results of [5, 7] and to extend them to the case
of gravitating dyons and dyonic black holes, we now present the equations of motion

5

in the notation of [7], in the following referred to as notation ii. in the schwarzschild
gauge the following identications hold

[6] : x
a
[7] : r e+

n k h j  2
e2 w h j  2
2

(23)

along with [7], we now employ the gauge choice e = r(r)

r , corresponding to isotropic

coordinates, and introduce the coordinate

and the dot (  ) now indicates the derivative with respect to  . to obtain a system of
rst order equations we further employ for the rst derivatives the new variables [7]

 = ln r ,

(24)

n =

r
r

,  =  + n , u =

w
r

, v = h ,

and we introduce

b = ej , c = b .

(note, that the symbol n here has a totally dierent meaning from eq. (14).)
then the following system of rst order autonomous equations is obtained

r = nr
n = n(  n)  (2u 2 + v 2)  22b2w 2

3 embedded reissner-nordstrm solutions

as noted long ago [9], the einstein-yang-mills-higgs system admits embedded rn
solutions. in notation i, rn solutions with mass , unit magnetic charge and arbitrary
electric charge q are given by

(x) =  

2(1 + q2)

2x

, a(x) = 1 ,

k(x) = 0 ,

j(x) = j 

q
x

, h(x) = 1 ,

(37)

(38)

where j is a priori arbitrary, but here chosen as j = q/xh (see eq. (51)). at the
regular horizon xh the metric function

n(x) =

x2  2x + 2(1 + q2)

x2

vanishes, n(xh) = 0, yielding

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

or equivalently

for xed values of  and q, rn solutions exist for xh  1 + q2, independent of .

in the extremal case

xh =  +q2

  2(1 + q2)

 =

x2
h + 2(1 + q2)

.

2xh

xh =  = q1 + q2 ,

extremal rn solutions are obtained. extremal rn solutions are characterized by q and
. in particular, for extremal rn solutions the function b(x) dened in (26) becomes
constant

4 dyon solutions

let us rst consider the globally regular particle-like solutions of the su(2) eymh
system.

in the prasad-sommereld limit,  = 0, the dyon solutions in at space are known
analytically [2], whereas for nite  they are obtained only numerically [14]. in the
presence of gravity, the corresponding gravitating monopole and dyon solutions are
obtained only numerically as well. the gravitating dyon solutions have many features
in common with the gravitating monopole solutions [6].

7

after presenting the boundary conditions for the asymptotically at globally regular
solutions, we here briey discuss the fundamental dyon solutions both in the prasad-
sommereld limit and for nite . then we turn to the excited dyon solutions.

4.1 boundary conditions

requiring asymptotically at solutions implies in notation i that the metric functions
a and  both approach a constant at innity. we here adopt

a() = 1 ,

(44)

and () =  represents the dimensionless mass of the solutions. the matter func-
tions also approach constants asymptotically,

k() = 0 ,

j() = j , h() = 1 ,

(45)

where for magnetic monopole solutions j = 0. the asymptotic fall-o of the function
j(x) determines the dimensionless electric charge q (see eq. (38)).

regularity of the solutions at the origin requires

(0) = 0 ,

and [2]

k(0) = 1 ,

j(0) = 0 , h(0) = 0 .

(46)

(47)

the local existence of a family of analytic solutions obeying these conditions is shown
in appendix a.1.

4.2 fundamental dyons

 = 0

like the gravitating monopole solutions, the gravitating dyon solutions exist up to
a maximal value of the coupling constant . beyond this value no dyon solutions exist.
the fundamental dyon branch does not end at the maximal value max, but bends
backwards and extends up to the critical value c. since 2 = 4gv2, variation of
the coupling constant along the fundamental dyon branch can be considered as rst
increasing g with v xed up to the maximal value max, and then decreasing v with g
xed up to the critical value c.

completely analogously to the fundamental monopole branch [5], the fundamental
dyon branch reaches a limiting solution at the critical value c, where it bifurcates with
the branch of extremal rn solutions of unit magnetic charge and electric charge q [6].
the critical value c(q) depends only slightly on the charge q [6].

8

for   c the minimum of the metric function n(x) of the dyon solutions decreases
monotonically, approaching zero at xc = c1 + q2. for x  xc, the metric function
n(x) of the limiting solution corresponds to the metric function of the extremal rn
black hole with horizon xh = xc = c1 + q2, unit magnetic charge and electric charge
q. likewise, for x  xc, the other functions of the limiting solution correspond to those
of this extremal rn black hole [6]. consequently, also the mass of the limiting solution
coincides with the mass of this extremal rn black hole.

on the interval 0  x  xc the functions n(x), k(x) and h(x) of the limiting
solution vary smoothly from their respective boundary values at x = 0 to those of
the extremal rn solution at xc, whereas the function j(x) is identically zero. the
metric function a(x) is identically zero, as well, on the interval 0  x < xc, but
discontinuous at xc. consequently, in the limiting spacetime the inner and outer parts
are not analytically connected [4, 5].

 > 0
let us briey consider the dyon solutions for nite higgs self-coupling,  > 0,
because we here encounter a phenomenon, also present for the black hole solutions at
vanishing higgs self-coupling,  = 0.

in at space dyon solutions of arbitrarily large charge exist only for  = 0.

in
contrast, for nite values of  dyon solutions exist only up to a maximal value of the
charge, qmax() [14]. as the maximal value of the charge is approached, the function
j(x) approaches asymptotically the limiting value

lim

qqmax

j = 1 .

(48)

at this point the solutions change character and become oscillating instead of asymp-
totically decaying [14].

as illustrated in figs. 1-2, this phenomenon persists in curved space. in fig. 1 we
show the mass of the at space dyon (solid line) and of the gravitating dyon (dashed
line, corresponding to  = 0.5) as a function of the charge q for 2 = 0 and 2 = 0.5.
in fig. 2 the corresponding asymptotic values of the function j(x) are presented. we
note, that for nite  also gravitating dyon solutions exist only up to a maximal value
of the charge, where j  1.

4.3 radially excited dyons

besides the branch of fundamental dyon solutions there are branches of radially excited
dyon solutions, where the gauge eld function k(x) of the n-th radially excited dyon
solution has n nodes.

these solutions have no at space counterparts, and the variation of  along a
branch of excited solutions must be interpreted as a variation of v with g xed. in
the limit   0 the higgs eld vacuum expectation value therefore vanishes, while g

9

remains nite. because of the particular choice of dimensionless variables (15), in this
limit the solutions shrink to zero size and their mass  diverges. as for the radially
excited monopole solutions [5], the coordinate transformation x = x/ leads to nite
limiting solutions in the limit   0, which are the bartnik-mckinnon solutions [6].
in fig. 3 we show the normalized mass / as a function of  for the rst excited
dyon branch with electric charge q = 1 and  = 0. for comparison also the rst
excited monopole branch is shown.

like the radially excited monopole solutions, the radially excited dyon solutions
exist only below a critical value of the coupling constant . for the radially excited
monopole solutions this critical value is c = 3/2 [5, 7]. for the radially excited dyon
solutions the critical value is larger and will be discussed in the context of the dyonic
black hole solutions.

5 black hole solutions

we now turn to the dyonic black hole solutions of the su(2) eymh system, choosing
 = 0. again, the su(2) eymh dyonic black holes have many features in common
with the magnetic non-abelian black holes [6]. in particular, dyonic non-abelian black
hole solutions exist in a limited domain of the -xh plane, which depends on the charge
q, and, in the limit xh  0, the corresponding globally regular solutions are obtained.
but a new phenomenon occurs for small values of , where the non-abelian solutions
no longer bifurcate with non-extremal rn solutions.

in the following, we briey present the boundary conditions. we generalize the
considerations of [7] to dyonic solutions and derive analytically the critical value of the
coupling constant, . we then present our numerical calculations for the fundamental
dyonic black hole solutions and their radial excitations.

5.1 boundary conditions

imposing the condition of asymptotic atness, the black hole solutions satisfy the same
boundary conditions at innity as the regular solutions. the existence of a regular
event horizon at xh leads in notation i to the conditions for the metric functions

(xh) =

xh
2

,

and a(xh) < , and for the matter functions
n k |xh = k  k 2  1
j|xh = 0 ,

x2 + h 2!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)xh

,

10

(49)

(50)

(51)

and

x2n h |xh = h(cid:16)2k 2 + 2x2(h 2  1)(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)xh

.

(52)

the local existence of a family of solutions obeying these conditions at the horizon is
demonstrated in appendix a.2.

5.2 critical value of 

for magnetic black holes, there are two regimes of the coupling constant , corre-
sponding to two distinct patterns of reaching a limiting solution as a function of the
horizon radius xh. for larger values of , the solutions bifurcate with an extremal rn
black hole solution, when the horizon radius appoaches its critical value xcr
h . here the
solutions tend towards the corresponding extremal rn solution with horizon radius
h =  only on the interval x  xrn
xrn
h , whereas they tend to a generic non-abelian
limiting solution on the interval xcr
[6]. in contrast for smaller values of
 the solutions bifurcate with a non-extremal rn solution on the full interval x  xcr
h
[5, 7]. the transition point between these two regimes corresponds to the critical value
, where the non-abelian black hole solutions tend towards the extremal rn solution
with horizon radius xrn
coin-
cide. for the magnetic non-abelian black holes this critical value is given by  = 3/2
[5, 7].

h =  on the full interval x  xcr

h  x  xrn

h = xrn

h , i.e. xcr

h and xrn

h

h

analogously, for dyonic non-abelian black holes there are also two regimes of the
coupling constant , with  marking the transition point between these two regimes.
we now derive this critical value  for the dyonic non-abelian black hole solutions,
following closely the reasoning of [7].

let us then consider the xed points of the system (27)-(35). employing notation

ii, the relevant xed point is given by the conguration

hh =  , wh = 0 , h = 1 , rh =

q1  2b2
where nh = vh = uh = ch = 0, while bh is such that 0  bh  1/.
linearization of the equations about this xed point leads to the following eigen-
values of the matrix dening the linear part (adopting the order n, w , u, h, v , p ,
q, )

h

in particular, we see that the eigenvalues 1,2, which are related to the function w and
determine the critical value  for the magnetic black holes [7], now depend on bh. the
zero mode 5 is related to the occurrence of this free parameter.

for q = 0, the critical value of  corresponds to the transition of the eigenvalue
1,2 (eq. (55) for q = 0) from complex to real value [7]. repeating this reasoning for
dyonic black holes, we conclude, that the corresponding critical value of the coupling
constant for the dyonic non-abelian black holes is given by

2 =

3

4  b2

h

.

(60)

here the relation of the critical value  to the charge q seems only indirect, since
the value of the function b(x) at the horizon enters in eq. (60). however, for the dyonic
non-abelian black holes  also represents the special point, where the non-abelian black
hole solutions tend towards the corresponding extremal rn solution with horizon radius
xrn
h . this implies for the function b(x)
according to eq. (43)

h = 1 + q2 on the full interval x  xcr

consequently, we may insert for bh in eq. (60) the constant rn value, eq. (43), and
obtain for the critical coupling constant the expression

which now depends on the electric charge q.

5.3 fundamental dyonic black holes

let us now dene some quantities helpful in the analysis of the numerical results.
denoting the set of functions of the extremal rn solution with horizon radius xrn
h =
1 + q2 by (nrn, krn, hrn, prn), and denoting the set of functions of the non-
abelian black hole solution with horizon radius xh (with xh < xrn
h ) by (n, k, h, p ),
we dene

dn = maxx[xrn

h ,]|nrn(x)  n(x)| ,

(63)

12

and analogously we dene the quantities dk, dp and dh. clearly the quantities dn,
dk, dp and dh must vanish, when the non-abelian black hole solutions bifurcate with
the corresponding extremal rn solution. therefore these quantities help to determine
the critical values with good accuracy in the regime   .

q = 0
our numerical evaluation of the domain of existence of the magnetic non-abelian
black holes in the -xh plane is in agreement with the results of [5, 7], and in particular
we conrm  = 3/2. considering the quantities dn, dk and dh (eq. (63)) as
functions of the horizon radius xh, we observe that for    the three functions
approach zero at a common value xcr
h ()  . as    changes sign, in particular the
quantity dk changes drastically, becoming a convex function when the critical horizon
radius xcr
q 6= 0
we have numerically determined the domain of existence of the fundamental dyonic
non-abelian black hole solutions in the -xh plane, which is shown in fig. 4 for q = 1.
the straight line indicates the extremal rn solutions, dividing the domain of existence
into a lower region with non-abelian black holes only and an upper region with both
non-abelian and non-extremal abelian black holes, completely analogously to the case
of magnetic black holes.

h is approached.

to start the detailed discussion of the diagram, we choose a small xed value of
the horizon radius xh and vary . then the dyonic black hole solutions exist only up
to some maximal value max(xh). from max(xh) a second branch extends backwards
until a critical value c(xh) is reached. with increasing xh the second branch becomes
increasingly smaller, and nally disappears. the critical values max(xh) and c(xh)
are both shown in fig. 4.

the presence of the two branches is illustrated in fig. 5 for q = 1 and xh = 0.8,
where the quantities dn, dk, dp and dh are shown as functions of the parameter
. here the second branch of solutions only exists in the small interval 1.1986   
1.2002.
for xed xh and varying , the functions of the black holes solutions evolve com-
pletely analogously to those of the regular dyon solutions. consequently, the limiting
solution reached at the critical value c(xh) consists of two parts, the outer part corre-
h = c1 + q2,
sponding to the exterior of the extremal rn black hole with horizon xrn
unit magnetic charge and electric charge q and the inner part representing a genuine
non-abelian solution.

similarly for xed  >  and varying xh, the limiting solution reached consists
of two parts, the outer part corresponding to the exterior of the extremal rn black
h = 1 + q2, unit magnetic charge and electric charge q, as
hole with horizon xrn
demonstrated in figs. 6-7 for the black hole solutions with horizon xh = 1, 1.1 and
1.153, charge q = 1 and  = 1 for the functions n and p and the functions k and h,

13

respectively.

according to eq. (62), for q = 1 the critical value  is given by  = q7/8 

0.935. here the transition between the two regimes with dierent bifurcation patterns
is supposed to occur. indeed, our numerical calculations conrm this critical value, as
demonstrated in figs. 8-9, where the four quantities dn, dk, dp and dh are shown
as functions of the horizon radius xh for  = 0.94 and  = 0.93, respectively.

for  = 0.94, which is slightly above , the curves in fig. 8 clearly approach
zero at xcr
h  1.235. this value is well below the horizon value of the corresponding
extremal rn solution, xrn
h , the
corresponding values of k(xh) and h(xh) do not tend to their rn values of zero and
one, respectively, but they converge to generic numbers in the interval [0, 1].

h = 1 + q2  1.329. moreover, in this limit xh  xcr

in contrast, for  = 0.93, which is slightly below , the function dk becomes a

h  0.932  1.315 is approached.

clearly, the transition point  occurs inbetween these two values. approaching 

convex function when the critical horizon radius xcr
furthermore, the quantities k(xh) and h(xh) tend to their rn values zero and one,
respectively, for xh  xcr
h . thus for  = 0.93 the limiting solution represents a rn
solution on the full interval x  xcr
h .
further from both sides, the value  = q7/8  0.935 is conrmed. the gap in fig. 4 on

the rhs of  represents a tiny region, numerically not accessible with sucient accuracy
[16]. we have conrmed the validity of eq. (62) also for other values of the charge q.
in the regime  < , we observe that the maximal value of the horizon radius xh
decreases with decreasing , completely analogously to the magnetic case. continuing
our detailed discussion of the approach to the limiting solution in this regime, however,
we observe dierences to the magnetic case for smaller values of .

for xed  close to  and increasing xh, the dyonic black hole solutions bifurcate
with a rn solution when the maximal value of the horizon is reached. the limiting
solution corresponds to the exterior of the rn solution on the full interval x  xcr
h .
for somewhat smaller xed  and increasing xh, the solutions do not yet bifurcate
with a non-extremal rn solution, when the maximal value of the horizon is reached.
instead a second branch of solutions emerges, extending backwards to lower values of
the horizon radius, until it bifurcates with a non-extremal rn solution at the critical
value of the horizon xcr
h [5, 7, 6]. moving along both branches, the values of k(xh) and
h(xh) change monotonically, reaching their respective rn values of zero and one as
the critical horizon is reached.

while this latter bifurcation pattern persits for the magnetic black holes also for
small values of  [5, 7], for the dyonic non-abelian black holes a new phenomenon occurs,
related to j attaining its maximal value of one. with decreasing , the value j of
the limiting solution increases. when it reaches its maximal value of one, the function
k(x) ceases to decay exponentially. the limiting solution then no longer represents a
non-extremal rn solution, but an oscillating solution is reached as the limiting solution.

14

also a third branch of solutions appears, corresponding again to increasing xh. moving
along all three branches, k(xh) increases monotonically, h(xh) decreases monotonically
and j increases monotonically until it reaches one. we illustrate this new phenomenon
for charge q = 1 and  = 0.55 in fig. 10, where we show the quantities kh, hh and
j as functions of the horizon radius.

for still smaller values of , the third branch disappears again, leaving two branches
which end when j reaches one. we illustrate this for charge q = 1 and  = 0.2 in
fig. 11, showing the quantities kh, hh and j as functions of the horizon radius.
the maximal horizon radius in this case is approximately 0.917. for small values
of  the lower curve in fig. 4 represents the critical value of the horizon, where the
asymptotically exponentially decaying solutions cease to exist.

5.4 excited dyonic black holes

besides the fundamental magnetic black hole solutions there exist radially excited black
hole solutions, for which the gauge function k(x) possesses n nodes [5, 7]. these

radially excited solutions exist only for    = 3/2 [5, 7].

our numerical analysis of the radially excited dyonic black hole solutions strongly
indicates that, at least for n = 1, the excited dyonic black hole solutions penetrate into
a small domain of the  >  regime, as can already be anticipated from fig. 3, where
the rst excited regular dyon solution is shown for charge q = 1. indeed, we observe
that the maximal value of , where the radially excited black hole solutions cease to
exist, increases more strongly with q than the critical value .

let us now consider the domain of existence of the black hole solutions in the xh
plane in more detail. in the regime  > , for xed xh and increasing  the solutions
again reach a limiting solution at the critical value c(xh), which consists of two parts,
the outer part corresponding to the exterior of the extremal rn black hole with horizon
h = c1 + q2, unit magnetic charge and electric charge q.
xrn
for   c(xh) the function n(x) develops a progressively decreasing minimum,
h = c(xh)1 + q2. this is illustrated in fig. 12, where the
nmin, reaching zero at xrn
value of nmin is shown as a function of  for the horizon radii xh = 0.01, 0.4 and 0.8
and charge q = 1. with increasing xh the value of c(xh) decreases, though is remains
greater than  even for xh = 0.8, as inspection of the four quantities dn, dk, dp
and dh reveals.

in fig. 13 we show the functions n(x), k(x), h(x) and p (x) of the rst radially
excited black hole solution for charge q = 1, horizon radius xh = 0.4 and  = 0.938 > .
h = c(xh)1 + q2,
the minimum of the function n(x), which here occurs close to xrn
remains well separated from the horizon xh for   c(xh).
considering nally the rst excited black hole solutions for small xed  and in-
creasing xh, we observe that as for the fundamental black hole solutions, the quantity

15

j here plays a major role. with increasing xh, j approaches its maximal value one,
where the asymptotically exponentially decaying solutions cease to exist. for  = 0.2,
for instance, this happens at xh  0.28.

6 conclusions

in analogy to gravitating monopoles [4, 5] also gravitating dyons [6] exist. when a
regular horizon xh is imposed, from these solutions black holes within monopoles
[4, 5] and black holes within dyons [6] emerge. besides the fundamental regular
and black hole solutions also radially excited solutions exist [5, 7, 6], related to the
corresponding eym solutions [13, 17]. the static spherically symmetric black holes
within monopoles and black holes within dyons provide counterexamples to the
no-hair conjecture.

the domain of existence of the fundamental dyonic non-abelian black hole solutions
in the  xh plane is similar to the one of the fundamental magnetic non-abelian black
hole solutions. there are two regimes of the coupling constant . for  < , the
maximal horizon radius increases with increasing , whereas for  >  it decreases.
the transition point between these two regimes, , depends on the charge q of the

solutions,  = q(3 + 4q2)/(4(1 + q2)).

for xed  and varying horizon radius, a limiting solution is approached. for  > 
the limiting solution consists of two distinct parts. the outer part corresponds to the
h = 1 + q2,
exterior of an extremal rn black hole solution with horizon radius xrn
unit magnetic charge and electric charge q, whereas on the interval xh  x < xrn
the
limiting solution has the features of generic non-abelian solutions. at the transition
point  =  the limiting solution corresponds precisely to the exterior of the extremal
h = 1 + q2, on the full interval
rn black hole solution with horizon radius xrn
x  xh. in contrast, for  <  the limiting solution represents the exterior of a non-
extremal rn solution for the larger values of , while for the smaller values of  the
dyonic non-abelian black hole solutions encounter a critical point, where the solutions
no longer are exponentially decaying but become oscillating.

h

the domain of existence of the radially excited dyonic non-abelian black hole so-
lutions in the   xh plane is similar to the one of the fundamental solutions. again,
there are two regimes of the coupling constant  with the transition point . this is in
contrast to the radially excited magnetic non-abelian black hole solutions, which exist
only up to  [5, 7].

in a large part of their domain of existence, the magnetic non-abelian black hole
solutions are classically stable [4, 5, 7, 18]. in contrast, dyonic non-abelian black hole
solutions should be classically unstable. as for the classical dyon solutions in at space,
their mass should be lowered continuously, by lowering the electric charge, as long as
there is no charge quantization [2].

16

considerations of stability of classical eymh black holes have led to a new type of
black holes, representing counterexamples of israels theorem. obtained perturbatively
[19], these static aspherical black holes represent black holes within multimonopoles.
besides static axially symmetric black holes, there exist static black holes with only
discrete symmetries [19]. while static axially symmetric eym black holes have recently
been obtained nonperturbatively [20], it remains a challenge to construct black holes
with only crystal symmetries non-perturbatively.

we show the local existence of the non-abelian dyon solutions at the singular point
x = 0 in appendix a.1 and the local existence of the non-abelian dyonic black hole
solutions at the singular point xh in appendix a.2.

7.1 appendix a.1

as for the monopoles, the eld equations for the dyons have singular points at x = 0
and x = . for the monopoles there exists a two-parameter family of local solutions
regular at x = 0. analogously, for the dyons there exists a three-parameter family of
local solutions regular at x = 0, as shown in the following.

let us consider eqs. (17)-(21), using notation i. at the singular point x = 0, the

expansion of regular solutions depends on four parameters, yielding

n(x) = 1  n2x2 + o(x4) ,
a(x) = a0(1 + a2x2 + o(x4)) ,
k(x) = 1  k2x2 + o(x4) ,
j(x) = a0(j1x + o(x3)) ,
h(x) = h1x + o(x3) ,

ui = ci + o(x2) , vi = o(x2)

(70)

which are locally analytic in x2 and in the constants ci. these constants correspond to
h1, j1 and k2 in (64).

7.2 appendix a.2

following [7] and considering the system of equations (27)-(35), we here demonstrate the
local existence of the non-abelian dyonic black hole solutions at the singular point xh.
black hole solutions are characterized by a rst order pole singularity of the function 
at the non-degenerate horizon [7]. due to translation invariance of the equations under
   + 0, we can assume that the horizon occurs at  = 0.
to rewrite the set of equations in the form (69), which reveals the number of free
parameters occurring in the expansion at the horizon of the locally analytic solution,
we introduce the following set of functions

(u1, u2, u3, u4, u5) = (r, w, h, 2n  2u 2  v 2, s) ,
(v1, v2, v3, v4) = ( 

, u, v, y  s( 

)) ,

1


1


with

s = b/ , y = s .

(71)

(72)

these functions are regular at the horizon and can be expanded in powers of  .
moreover, it follows that the equations for ui and vk are of the form (69) with 1 = 2,
2 = 3 = 1 and 4 = 3. this demonstrates the existence of a ve-parameter family
of local analytic solutions of the equations. because of the constraint (36), it actually
reduces to a four-parameter family of local solutions.
