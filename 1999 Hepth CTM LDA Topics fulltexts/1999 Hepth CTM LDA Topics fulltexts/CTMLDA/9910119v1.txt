introduction

the study of some patterns [1], connected with n = 1 supergravity theory in
eleven dimensions, has led to a recent understanding in terms of a weyl character
formula by gkrs [2], based on equal rank embeddings of reductive lie algebras.
by using the construction of equal rank embedding of reductive lie algebras, all
possible equal rank embeddings were cataloged, and nearly all supersymmetric
multiplets of massless and massive particles which have already known in super-
symmetric gauge eld theories emerge as the lowest lines of the innite tower
multiplet spectra, some of them shown in details in ref. [1]. immediately after
the appearance of weyl character formula for equal rank embedding as an index
formula for dirac operator, kostant moved the subject forward and related the
multiplet spectrum to the kernel of a cubic dirac operator which he introduced
around 30 years ago [3].

in this paper, we extend the gross-kostant-ramond-sternbergs weyl char-
acter formula and kostants cubic dirac operator for equal rank embedding of
reductive lie algebras to those of basic lie superalgebras. in section ii, we give
a brief review in [gkrs]s paper. a derivation of the weyl character formula
for an equal rank embedding is shown. in section iii, we extend the equal rank
embedding construction of reductive lie algebras shown in section ii to that
of basic lie superalgebras. the kac character formulas are written in terms of
equal rank subalgebras. in section iv, we give a simple and explicit formulation
for a typical representation of type i lie superalgebras. in section v, we build a
multiplet of type i lie superalgebras from that of reductive lie algebras. in sec-
tion vi, kostants cubic dirac operator is constructed for full lie superalgebras
and then for equal rank embeddings.

ii weyl character formula and equal rank em-

beddings of reductive lie algebras

let r be an equal rank subalgebra of reductive lie algebras, g, and let c be order
of c, the ratio of weyl group of g to that of r. the restricted conditions for
this kind of equal rank embedding, g  r, are that (1) positive roots of g must
contain those of r, i.e. +(g)  +(r), and (2) the simple roots of g and r must
be chosen consistently so that the positive weyl chamber of r contains that of g.
in cartan-weyl basis, the c elements of weyl group in c acting on the sum of
highest weight, , and weyl vector of g, g, and then after subtracting by weyl
vector of r, r, generate c irreducible representations of r, called c-multiplet,

c   := c( + )g  r.

the weyl character formula of the irreducible representation of g, v, can be
rewritten in terms of the irreducible representation of r, uc, as follows:

chv = pww (g) sgn(w)ew(+g )
pww (g) sgn(w)ewg

g/r), i.e.

the beauty of eq.(1) is that it gives us

v  s+  v  s = xcc

sgn(c)uc.

(2)

eq.(2) should be viewed as an equation in the grothendieck ring of r. the
lhs is the character of the dierence between two representations of the same
dimension the representation of g with highest weight , this representation re-
stricted to r tensored with each of the half spin representations of so(p), where
p = dim g  dim r, restricted to r. in the other words, the lhs is the algebraic
index of the dirac operator associated to  and the two half spin representa-
tions. the alternating sum on the rhs is just the dimension dierence between
kernel and cokernel of the dirac operator. all the representations on the rhs
are inequivalent and so the rhs is the end result of a lot of cancellation in the
lhs, in short an index formula for the dirac operator. one of the remarkable
consequences of eq.(2) is that, on the lhs, the order of dierence of v  s+
and v  s is always equal to c, independent of , and, on the rhs, the
multiplicity of each uc representation is exactly one.

notice that c is equal to the euler number which is a topological invariant
of the coset manifold, g/r, corresponding to exponentiation of g/r. from our
catalog of equal rank embedding of reductive lie algebras, we would like to
give some examples of the coset manifolds where supersymmetric multiplets
appear to be in their lowest lines of the innite tower multiplet spectra. n = 2
hypermultiplet, n = 4 vector multiplet, and n = 8 supergravity multiplet
which undoubtedly emerge in the lowest lines of su (n +1)  su (n )u (1) and
so(n +2)  so(n )so(2) series live on the n-dimensional complex projective
space and (n +2)-dimensional complex grassmannian manifold, respectively. if
so(2) or u(1) is viewed as the light-cone little group, these lowest line spectra
are massless supermultiplets in 4-dimensional space-time. whereas n = 1,
n = 2, n = 3, and n = 4 massive (massless) multiplets in 4-dimensional
(6-dimensional) space-time which emerge in the lowest lines of sp(2n + 2) 
sp(2n )  sp(2) series live on n-dimensional quaternionic projective space. the
last multiplet that we would like to mention is the n = 1 massless (massive)
supergravity triplet in 11-dimensional (10-dimensional) space-time. the triplet
emerges from f4  so(9) and lives on (16-dimensional) cayley plane. all

iii kac character formulas and equal rank em-

bedding of basic lie superalgebras

now, we extend the results of reductive lie algebras to lie superalgebras with
non-degenerate killing form. according to kacs classication [5], there are two
types of basic lie superalgebras, type i which is su(m|n) and osp(2|2n) and
type ii which is osp(2m + 1|2n), osp(1|2n), osp(2m|2n), osp(4|2; ), f (4), and
g(3).

let g = geven  godd be the lie superalgebras with the root system  =
even  odd. for type i, geven is simple, i.e. geven = g0, and, for type ii, geven
can be graded into g2  g0  g2. while, for the odd part of both type i and ii,
odd generators can be graded into fermionic creation and annihilation ones, i.e.
godd = g1  g1. the poincare-birkho-witt theorem for lie algebras can be
applied to the case of lie superalgebras with some extension [6]. this grading
gives us a universal enveloping algebra, u(g), e.g., for type i,

u(g) = u(g1)  u(g0)  u(g1).

dene root subsystems, even and odd, such that even = { | /2 / odd}
and odd = { | 2 / even}. since even, odd, even and odd are invariant
under the action of weyl group of geven. hence, weyl group of g is equal to
that of geven, i.e. w (g) = w (geven). dene weyl vector of g to be one-half
the sum of positive even roots minus one-half the sum of positive odd roots,
i.e.  = even  odd. let v () be a representation of g with  as a highest
weight in dual cartan subalgebra. the highest weight representations of g
are classied into typical and atypical. the representation is typical if, for
+
  
odd, ( + , ) 6= 0; otherwise, it is atypical. the typical kac character
and supercharacter formulas of v () are dened, respectively, as

the sgn(w) and sgn(w) are sign change due to number of reections with respect

in general, in an equal rank embedding of lie superalgebras r in g with
+(r)  +(g) and c as an index of the weyl group of r in the weyl group of
g, a c-multiplet of r is obtained by

c   := c( + )g  r,

where c  c. under the condition that +
of c, i.e. c  +
g-module v () can be written in terms of r-module u (c  ) as follows:

for type i lie superalgebras, there are both typical and atypical representa-

tions. for the typical representation, superdimension, sdim v () = dim veven()
dim vodd(), is equal to zero. whereas, sdim v () of the atypical representa-
+
tion is not. every type i odd root is zero-length and +
even. since odd
is invariant under the action of weyl group, i.e. wodd = odd. the type i
typical kac character formula (3) can be written as

even = 

chv () = y++
= y

(1 + e)chv0()

(1 + e)chv0().

multiplying out the product factor on the rhs of eq.(7), we obtain a chern
character of an exterior algebra over g1,

n=dim(

1)

(1 + e) =

y

1

xn=0

ch(ng1) = ch(g1).

so, eq.(7) simply becomes

chv () = ch(g1)chv0().

similarly, the type i typical kac supercharacter can be shown to be

schv () = y

1

(1  e)chv0()

= sch(g1)chv0().

(8)

(9)

on the other hand, since {g1, g1} = 0, the universal enveloping algebra over
g1, u(g1), is isomorphic to the exterior algebra over g1, (g1). the g-
module v () can be induced by applying the antisymmetric combinations of
the g1 generators on v0(), i.e.

v () = (g1)  v0()  u(g1)  v0().

(10)

the character and supercharacter of eq.(10) are exactly eq.(8) and eq.(9).

in an equal rank embedding, g  r, of type i which has c as an index of
w (r) in w (g) and is restricted to the condition that +(g)  +(r), eq.(7)
becomes

chv () =

i.e.

 ,

chv ()(cid:0)ch s+  ch s(cid:1) = ch ((g1/r1))xcc

sgn(c)chu (c  ).

(11)

similarly done for the supercharacter, we obtain

schv ()(cid:0)ch s+  ch s(cid:1) = sch ((g1/r1))xcc

sgn(c)schu (c  ).

(12)

eq.(11) and eq.(12) correspond to

v ()  s+  v ()  s = (g1/r1)  xcc

sgn(c)u (c  ).

(13)

now, eq.(13) can also be derived explicitly from eq.(10). by decomposing the
g1 basis such that g1 = (g1/r1)r1, there exists a map (g1/r1)r1 7

6

(g1/r1)  1 + 1  r1 from (g1/r1)  r1 to (g1/r1)  r1 which extends
uniquely to an isomorphism of exterior algebra,

 (g1/r1  r1)  (g1/r1)  (r1).

by substituting the above equation into eq.(10) and tensoring on both side by
(s+  s), we obtain

v ()  s+  v ()  s = (g1/r1)  xcc
= (g1/r1)  xcc

sgn(c) ((r1)  u0(c  ))

sgn(c)u (c  ),

which is exactly eq.(13).

for osp(1|2n) of type ii lie superalgebras, every osp(1|2n) odd root has

length equal to one-half of the short positive one and

osp(1|2n) = even  odd = (cid:18)n

, n

,    ,

2(cid:19) .

furthermore, every osp(1|2n) representation is typical, but dim veven() 6=
dim vodd(). nevertheless, the kac character and supercharacter formulas of a
osp(1|2n) representation can be shown to be similar to that of lie algebra, i.e.

chv () = pww sgn(w)ew(+)
pww sgn(w)ew()
schv () = pww sgn(w)ew(+)
pww sgn(w)ew()

,

.

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

the equal rank embedding of osp(1|2m)  osp(1|2n  2m) in osp(1|2n) is the
only possible type with the full subsuperalgebra. in this case, all odd generators
of g are completely eaten by the r. whereas, the even generators of g which
are left form the orthogonal complement basis to the even basis of r under the
killing form of g. under the restriction to r-module, eq.(14) and eq.(15) simply
become

chv () =

sgn(c)chu (c  ),

1

 xcc

and

schv () =

1

 xcc

sgn(c)schu (c  ).

both eq.(16) and eq.(17) correspond to

v ()  s+  v ()  s = xcc

sgn(c)u (c  ).

(18)

for the rest of type ii, we use kac character and supercharacter formulas of
equal rank embedding, eq.(5) and eq.(6). if g1 and g1 are vector spaces of odd

7

generators, there is a canonical linear map from ag1  bg1 to a+b(g1  g1),
which takes ((g1)1      (g1)a)  ((g1)1      (g1)b) to ((g1)1      (g1)a 
(g1)1      (g1)b). this determines a linear isomorphism

the prefactor n1 of kac character formula is generally the character of the
exterior algebra over the direct sum of g1 andg1 vector spaces

finally, the type ii typical kac character and supercharacter can be written as

chv ()(cid:0)ch s+  ch s(cid:1) = ch  (g1/r1  g1/r1)xcc

sgn(c)chu (c  ), (19)

and

schv ()(cid:0)ch s+  ch s(cid:1) = sch(g1/r1g1/r1)xcc

sgn(c)schu (c), (20)

which correspond to

v ()  s+  v ()  s = (g1/r1  g1/r1)  xcc

sgn(c)u (c  ).

(21)

iv representations of g1 of type i lie super-

algebras

for type i lie superalgebras with non-degenerate killing form, the typical rep-
resentation is induced by applying g1 generators on g0-module. therefore, we
need to know an explicit representation of g1 in terms of g0-module. let n
be dimension of 

1 . the exterior algebra over g1 is

g1 =

mk=0

with dimension,

dim(g1) =

n

mk=0

dim(kg1) =

sdim(g1) =

n

mk=0

sdim(kg1) =

n

xk=0

(1)k(cid:18) n

k (cid:19) = 0.

let q
i=1,2,...,n be n completely antisymmetric fermionic generators which trans-
form in the fundamental representation of g0. the fermionic generators generate
even and odd modules which are isomorphic to a direct sum of two spinor repre-
sentations of so(2n ). one of spinor representation of so(2n ) is the even module
of g1, called bosonic module, and the other is the odd module of g1, called
fermionic module. let t + be the bosonic module and t  be the fermionic
module of so(2n ) such that

t + = 0g1  2g1  4g1  . . .

with restriction to g0-module, the type i typical representation is

v () = g1  v0()

= (cid:0)t +  t (cid:1)  v0().

for su(m|n), g1 representation is isomorphic to a direct sum of two spinor
i trans-

representations of so(2mn). with restriction to su(m)  su(n)  u(1), q
forms as (m, n)1, where -1 is a u(1) charge.

v building type i c-multiplets and kostants

cubic dirac operator

for type i lie superalgebras, there is a remarkable point we would like to men-
tion. from the multiplet spectrum of equal rank embedding of reductive lie
algebras, r0  g0, we can build the spectrum of the type i lie superalgebras
on top of them by simply tensoring them with a module generated by r1 gen-
erators. the r1 generators transform in the fundamental representation of
r0.

dene (r1) = r+  r such that

u () = (r1)  u0() = (r+  r)  u0().

tensoring on both side of eq.(2) with (r1), we obtain

 (r1) (cid:0)v0()  s+  v0()  s(cid:1) = xcc
= xcc

sgn(c) ((r1)  u0(c  ))

sgn(c)u (c  ).

(22)

under restriction to r0-module, whenever v0() on the lhs of eq.(22) is su(n)
u(1), or sp(2n)  u(1), there is an emergence of type i typical c-multiplet on
the rhs. notice in the case that u (c  ) is su(m|n), the representations of r
are similar to those of s except u(1) values.

let g = rp be lie superalgebras where p is the orthogonal complement to r
under the non-degenerate killing form of g. let p = peven podd = p0 p1 p1.
tensoring on both sides of eq.(22) by p1, we get

v ()  s+  v ()  s = p1  xcc

sgn(c)u (c  ),

(23)

which is exactly eq.(13). now, we need to get rid of p1 on the rhs of eq.(23)
by mapping it into identity. to do so, we do a tensor product on both sides of
eq.(23) by the following contraction , sometimes called an internal product, on
exterior powers between vector space and its dual:

n (podd) = n p1  n p1 = 1.

eq.(23) becomes

(n podd)  v ()  (s+  s) = 1  xcc

sgn(c)u (c  ).

(24)

11

as already known, the character form of a dirac operator, 6   c(p), with a

map 6  : s  s is

ch(6 ) = ch(s+)  ch(s).

the character of eq.(1) implies that there exists a kostants dirac operator,
6 k  u(geven)  c(peven), with a map

6 k : v  s  v  s.

(25)

similarly, the character of eq.(24) suggests that there exists the operator for
lie superalgebras, 6 k  u(podd)  u(geven  godd)  c(peven), with a map

6 k : v ()  s  v ()  s.

(26)

vi kostants cubic dirac operator for an equal

rank embedding of lie superalgebras

let li and fa be even and odd generators, respectively, for z2-graded lie
superalgebras such that

and

[li, lj] = f[ijk]lk,

{fa, fb} = fi(ab)li,

[li, fa] = f[ia]bfb,

where i,j, k = 1, 2, . . . , dim(g0) and a, b = 1, 2, . . . , dim(g1). the kostants
cubic dirac operator of lie superalgebras is extended from that of lie algebras
by adding just two terms, a linear term in odd operators and a structure constant
term, i.e.

sum over all indices is assumed in the above equations, where [. . . ]
in the
subscript is for antisymmetric sum and (. . . ) for symmetric sum. eq.(28) is
the kostantcubic dirac operator for reductive lie algebras. the -matrices
associated to even generators are normalized so that

which gives

{i, j} = ij ,

{i , [ijk]} = ik[ij].

the -matrices associated to odd generators are subjected to the following con-
ditions.

12

(i) {i, a} = 0. this relation is consistent with the antisymmetric property of
product of even and odd generators.
(ii) {a, [b, c]} + {[a, c], b} = [(ab), c] = 0. this property is due to
invariance of odd gennerators under killing form.

in contrary to the even part, eq.(34) by itself is not invariant due to the presence
of a linear term in even generators. the linear term in li will be cancelled out by
one of the the cross terms of the square of the combined even and odd kostants

recall that, for lie superalgebras,  = 0  1. eq.(35) can be simply written
as

(6 k)2 = c2() + (, ),

(37)

where

c2() = (ij)l(ilj) + [ab]f[afb].

the laplacian operator turns out to be invariant under the action of even
and odd generators of g again. for lie superalgebras, the generalization of
freudenthal-de vries strange formula still holds [7]

(, ) =

h

(dim g0  dim g1),

(38)

where hs, the dual coxeter numbers, of g are given in table 1.

in an equal rank embedding of lie superalgebras, g  r, with g  r, let
the even and odd generators, li and fa, span the basis of g. in according to
the g = r  p decomposition, li and fa span the basis of r and li and fa span
the basis of p, the orthogonal complement of r under the killing form of g. the
kostants cubic dirac operator on p = g/r is

6 kp = 6 kg 6 kr

= i li + afa

[ijk]f[ijk]

2

i (ab)fi(ab),

(39)

where f[ijk] and fi(ab) are the structure constants of g that are not in r. since,
under the killing form of g, r and p basis are orthogonal to each other,

{i, i } = {i, a} = {a, i } = {a, a} = 0.

as a result, we have

{6 kr, 6 kp} = 0.

14

the square of kostants coset cubic dirac operator simply is

(6 kp)2 = (6 kg)2  (6 kr)2

= (c2 + (, ))g  (c2 + (, ))r .

(40)

notice that both (6 kg)2 and (6 kr)2 commute with the generators of r. hence,
(6 kp)2 is also invariant under the action of r.

in conclusion, we have derived the kac character formulas and have con-
structed kostants cubic dirac operator for equal rank embeddings of lie su-
peralgebras. in case of reductive lie algebras, the coset space method of equal
rank embeddings led to a kazama-suzuki model construction of a new class of
unitary n = 2 superconformal theories [8] and a subclass of the construction
could be represented by landau-ginzburg models [9]. in case of lie superalge-
bras, it deserves to be pursued whether there will be any relevance of the coset
superspace method to a construction of any physical model.
