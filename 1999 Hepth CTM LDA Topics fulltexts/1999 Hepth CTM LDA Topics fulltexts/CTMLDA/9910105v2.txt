abstract

strominger has derived the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the btz
black hole using asymptotic virasoro algebra. we apply stro-
mingers method to a black hole solution found by martnez and
zanelli (mz). this is a solution of three-dimensional gravity with a
conformal scalar eld. the solution is not ads3, but it is asymp-
totically ads3; therefore, it has the asymptotic virasoro algebra.
we compute the central charge for the theory and compares cardys
formula with the bekenstein-hawking entropy. it turns out that the
functional form does agree, but the overall numerical coecient does
not. this is because this approach gives the maximum possible en-
tropy for the numerical coecient.

1 introduction

using d-brane technology [1], one now believes that the bekenstein-hawking
entropy of a black hole is a true statistical entropy. there remain many issues
however.

for example, the d-brane approach depends on the details of d-brane
dynamics and is complicated. however, black hole thermodynamics is a
universal feature of metric theories of gravity [2]. moreover, the bekenstein-
hawking entropy was originally derived using quantum eld theory on curved
spacetime. therefore, any microscopic theory should reproduce the bekenstein-
hawking entropy if its low-energy action is written in terms of metric. a
derivation of the black hole entropy is just a consistency check of a micro-
scopic theory.

thus, the details of a microscopic theory should not be relevant in order to
understand the entropy. one would like to know the necessary and sucient
ingredients to understand the entropy. stromingers work is an important
step in this respect [3].

three-dimensional anti-desitter space (ads3) has the asymptotic sym-
metry group which is generated by two copies of virasoro algebra [4]. the
central charge of the algebra is given by

c =

3l
2g

,

(1)

where g is the three-dimensional newtons constant and  = 1/l2 is the
cosmological constant. then, if one considers quantum gravity on ads3, the
physical states at innity must form a representation of this algebra. the
asymptotic density of states of a conformal eld theory (cft) is given by
cardys formula:

sasymp = 2s c

6

+ 2s c 

6

,

(2)

where  and  are the eigenvalues of l0 and l0. applying this formula to the
banados-teitelboim-zanelli (btz) black hole [5], strominger has obtained
the bekenstein-hawking entropy for the black hole with a precise numerical

coecient. for the btz black hole,  and  are given by the mass and
angular momentum as follows:

(4)

the derivation is very powerful and does not depend on the details of
the microscopic theory. however, there are many problems as well [6]. one
of the most important problems is the relevance of the asymptotic geometry
and where the degrees of freedom actually live.

stromingers argument depends on the asymptotic symmetries at spatial
innity. on the contrary, the bekenstein-hawking entropy depends only on
the area of a black hole horizon. one usually regards this as an indication
that the degrees of freedom relevant for the entropy live on the horizon.
if so, what is really important is the near-horizon geometry and not the
asymptotic geometry.
in fact, stromingers argument has been applied to
various higher dimensional black holes whose near-horizon geometries are
the btz black hole and has reproduced the correct entropy [7]. there are
several possibilities why it works:

1. in light of ads/cft correspondence [8, 9, 10], there are two possibil-

ities:

(a) the branes are indeed located there. this could be possible since
asymptotic innity is not really innity; one only looks at the
near-horizon geometry.

(b) martinec points out another possibility [11]; the entropy comes
from brane dynamics at the horizon, but the conformal anomaly
of the branes is transported at spatial innity by an anomaly
inow mechanism.

2. from the viewpoint of pure gravity, this may be because of the triv-
ial nature of three-dimensional gravity which has no bulk degrees of

2

freedom. for instance, three-dimensional gravity can be written as a
boundary liouville theory [12].

of course, the liouville theory has too few degrees of freedom to account
for the entropy; its eective central charge is cef f = 1. but we regard this
as an indication that the liouville theory is just the master eld, not the
microscopic description [6, 11, 13].

even though three-dimensional pure gravity has no bulk degrees of free-
dom, the entropy could be non-zero. one should distinguish the low-energy
degrees of freedom discussed here and the microscopic degrees of freedom
which constitute the bekenstein-hawking entropy. the bekenstein-hawking
entropy predicts that any sensible quantum gravity must have the degrees of
freedom which are necessary to account for the entropy. how such degrees of
freedom are actually realized may dier for each quantum theory. for exam-
ple, it may come from the massive stringy degrees of freedom [14]. or it may
come from the twisted sectors in pure gravity [15]. it would be interesting
to nd how such degrees of freedom actually explain the central charge (1),
but as far as stromingers approach concerns, it is not really necessary.

in this paper, we consider three-dimensional gravity with a conformal
scalar eld. we apply stromingers argument to a black hole solution of
the theory, the martnez and zanelli (mz) solution [16]. the solution is
not ads3 but it is asymptotically ads3 (see section 3.1 for the denition of
asymptotically ads3); therefore, it has the asymptotic virasoro algebra. if
stromingers method works due to the triviality of three-dimensional gravity,
it will not work for such a theory. thus, our approach is somewhat dierent
from stromingers one.

in section 2, we review the mz solution and discuss the properties of the
solution. in section 3, we discuss the hamiltonian formalism and calculate
the central charge a la brown-henneaux. in section 4, using these results, we
compare cardys formula with the bekenstein-hawking entropy. we found
that the functional form agrees with the boundary cft prediction. the over-
all numerical coecient does not agree however; this is because this approach
gives the maximum possible entropy for the numerical coecient [17]. in
this sense, the discrepancy in the numerical coecient may indicate that this

3

method does not work perfectly when there are bulk low-energy degrees of
freedom and may support possibility 2.
in appendix a, we summarize a
number of dierent expansions considered in this paper. in appendix b, we
discuss ads/cft correspondence to obtain the central charge. this is the
rst attempt to study stromingers method applied to asymptotically ads3
black holes other than the btz black hole.

2 the martnez-zanelli black hole

if ricci scalar is constant, a metric satises the brown-henneauxs boundary
conditions [4]. solving the constant ricci scalar for a three-dimensional static
metric, one can easily see that the metric satises the boundary conditions.
now, since the eld equation can be written as

r 

1
2

gr 

1
l2 g = 8gt,

(5)

the ricci scalar is in fact constant if the matter stress tensor t is traceless:

r = 

6
l2 .

(6)

this is a reason why we consider the conformal scalar; the conformal scalar
has a traceless stress tensor.

we consider the action given by

s = zm
4(d1) = 1

d3xg( r + 2l2
16g 
where  = d2
8. the surface term b should be included so as to
eliminate the second derivatives of the metric. the eld equations are given
by eq. (5) and the matter eld equation,

the matter stress tensor t is given by

(9)

one can easily check that the matter stress tensor (9) is traceless.

the mz solution is

(11)

(12)

where r = r+ is the horizon which is related to the mass by

m =

l (cid:19)2
32g (cid:18)r+

.

we make a couple of comments on the solution. first, the metric (10) ap-
proaches ads3 asymptotically. however, the solution is not ads3 in general.
to see this, note that ads3 is conformally at. the standard weyl tensor
vanishes identically in three dimensions, so it is not suitable for our purpose.
but there is a conformally invariant tensor which plays a role analogous to
that of the weyl tensor [18]:

c = r  r 

1
4

(g  g)r.

(13)

a three-geometry is conformally at if and only if c = 0. for the metric
(10), the tensor c vanishes only asymptotically.

second, since we have a constant ricci scalar, the conformal scalar  has
m2 =  3
4l2 from eq. (8); the scalar is a tachyon. this is not a problem. the
stability on adsd only requires that m2   (d1)2
[19]. conformal scalars
in any dimensions satisfy the bound since m2 =  d(d2)
. however, the mz
black hole is not stable under linear perturbations of the metric [20]. this
could cause a problem if one wants to discuss its thermodynamics. this is
not really our purpose however; for our purpose, it is sucient if the entropy
makes sense.

4l2

4l2

third, the solution has a non-trivial scalar eld; moreover, the scalar eld
is regular everywhere. on the other hand, the no-hair theorems require that
scalar elds which are regular be vanish [21]. this is partly due to the fact
that the spacetime in question is not asymptotically at.

5

bekensteins proof is for four-dimensional spacetime without a cosmolog-
ical constant. however, the setup, itself, can be used for any dimensions
and for the cases with a cosmological constant. his proof uses the fact that
the volume integral of a positive denite function which is made from scalar
elds is equal to surface integrals at the horizon and at asymptotic innity.
the surface integral at innity vanishes for asymptotically at solutions. the
surface integral at the horizon vanishes for the scalar elds bounded on the
horizon. therefore, the volume integral has to vanish and the only way is
for the scalar elds to vanish identically. thus, any non-trivial scalar eld
has to diverge at the horizon. however, the surface integral at asymptotic
innity does not vanish for the mz solution; therefore, the scalar eld does
not have to vanish.

now, the entropy of the black hole is given by

or

sbh =

r+
3g

sbh =

4
3

ls 2m

3g

(14)

(15)

in terms of the mass. the entropy does not satisfy the area law sbh =
a/(4g). this is because the action (7) is not in the einstein-hilbert action
form. rather, the action (7) is written as

s =

1

16g zm

d3xg(1  g2)r +    .

(16)

one can understand that the discrepancy arises because the newtons con-
stant at the horizon is scaled by the factor (1  g2). by a conformal
transformation to the einstein metric,

ge
 = (1  g2)2g,

(17)

one can check the area law is satised in the einstein metric.

the mass and the hawking temperature of a black hole are physical
quantities. these quantities do not change under a conformal transformation
[22]; the conformal transformation is just a change of variables. so, the

6

black hole entropy is a physical quantity as well by the rst law of black
hole thermodynamics. however, the horizon area does change under the
transformation. therefore, the area law is not satised in all frames; it is
satised only in the einstein metric. the area law in a general frame is given
by walds formula [2]:

sbh = 2z

l
r

nn,

(18)

where l is a lagrangian, n is the binormal to the horizon  with the
normalization n2 = 2, and the functional derivative is taken by formally
regarding the riemann tensor as a eld which is independent of the metric.
1 applying the formula to the action (7), we get

sbh =

(1  g2
4g

+)a

,

(19)

where + is the value of the conformal scalar at the horizon. this expression
agrees with eq. (14).

3 hamiltonian formulation

in this section, we summarize the asymptotic symmetry and the hamiltonian
formulation [23] of three-dimensional einstein gravity with a conformal scalar
eld. we then compute the central charge of the theory.

3.1 asymptotically anti-desitter space

we are interested in any black hole solutions which are ads3 asymptotically,
so we rst dene asymptotically ads3:

(i) they should contain the mz black hole solution.

(ii) they should be invariant under the ads3 group o(2, 2) at spatial in-

nity.

1strictly speaking, sbh dened by walds formula has not been proven to satisfy the

second law of black hole thermodynamics [2].

7

(iii) they should make the surface integrals associated with the generators

of o(2, 2) nite.

these are the same conditions as imposed by henneaux and teitelboim for
asymptotically ads4 [24].

we henceforth use the zero-mass black hole as the reference spacetime.
although the reference spacetime is the source of a number of issues (see
section 4.2), we adopt it for the time being. in order to explicitly represent
the asymptotically ads3 conditions, consider the coordinate system in which
the zero-mass black hole reads

l2
r2 dr2 + r2d2.
then, the components of the ads3 killing vector  behave as

gdxdx = 

r2
l2 dt2 +



ds2 =

(3)t = o(1),

(3)r = o(r),

(3) = o(1),

r

(3)t = o(r3), r

(3)r = o(1), r

(3) = o(r3),

(20)

(21)

where (3) ( = t, r, ) are the components of the vector  in the spacetime
coordinate  = (3) . we will also use  ( =, r, ) for the components
of the same vector , which is decomposed into  = n+ii (i = r, ) where
n is a unit normal vector to the time slice. the components  and i describe
the normal and tangential components of a hypersurface deformation. using
the lapse n  and the shifts n i, they are related to the spacetime components
by

 = n (3)t,
n i
n  .

i = (3)i +

(22)

(23)

from the conditions (i) and (ii), we are led to the boundary conditions

for the metric perturbation q = g 


g,

qab = o(1),

qra = o(r3),

qrr = o(r4),

where a, b = t,  and

 = o(r1/2).

8

(24)

(25)

the asymptotic behavior of  is motivated by the mz solution and is kept
by the coordinate transformation of the ads3 group.

by using eq.(24), the asymptotic behavior of the ads3 killing vector (21)

is rewritten in terms of  by

 = o(r),

r = o(r),

 = o(1),

r = o(1), rr = o(1), r = o(r3).

(26)

as brown and henneaux showed for pure gravity [4], the asymptotic
symmetry which preserves the asymptotic conditions (24) and (25) is actually
extended into the pseudo-conformal group in two dimensions:

l2
(3)t = l"t +(x+) + t (x) +
2r2 (2
(3)r = r (+t + + t ) + o(r1),
(3) = t +  t  

+t +  2

l2
2r2 (2

t ) + o(r4),

+t + + 2

t )# + o(r4),

where

x =

t
l  .

(27)

(28)

one can indeed check that the above dieomorphisms obey the virasoro
algebra. denoting the dieomorphisms with t 
(i = 1, 2, 3) as i, one nds
i

t 

3 = 2(cid:16)t 

(29)
where 3 = [1, 2]. therefore, ln and ln ( < n < ) which generate
the dieomorphisms with t + = einx+/2 and t  = einx/2 respectively, obey
the algebra

1 (cid:17) ,
2 t 

2  t 

1 t 

i[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m,
i[ ln, lm] = (n  m) ln+m,
[ln, lm] = 0.

since by denition

l0 + l0

t =

 = l0  l0,

l

9

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

the mass and angular momentum of a black hole are related to the charges
associated with l0 and l0 as

l0 + l0

,
m =
j = l0  l0.

l

(35)

(36)

3.2 canonical realization of asymptotic symmetry

our task now is to calculate the central charge in the canonical realization
of the algebra.

using the standard adm decomposition, we obtain the bulk hamiltonian

h[n] = z d2xhn h + n ihii ,

(37)

where n  and n i are the lapse and the shift functions respectively. the
hamiltonian and momentum constraints are given by

(38)

(39)

where ij and p are the canonical conjugate momenta of hij and  respec-
tively, and

gijkl = hi(khl)j  hijhkl,

(16g)2,

(40)

(41)

(42)

here, u  = u

 and (2)r is the two-dimensional ricci scalar.

since we consider spacetimes with open spacelike surfaces, we must pay
attention to boundary terms. the boundary terms are necessary in order
to make the functional derivative of the hamiltonian well-dened. from

10

eqs.(24) and (25), we can read o the boundary conditions for the canonical
variables as

qrr = o(r4),

qr = o(r3),

q = o(1),

rr = o(r1), r = o(r2),  = o(r5),

(43)

 = o(r1/2), p = o(r3/2).

under the asymptotic behavior of the canonical variables (43) and the surface
deformation vector  (26), the boundary terms become

j[] = j []  i d
j [] = i d

where  is any variation in the conguration space of asymptotically ads3.
note j [] is the surface term which arises for pure gravity.

in general, we may not be able to write the second term of eq.(44) in
terms of a total derivative. however, the mz solution has no-scalar hair,
which means that the second term in eq.(44) vanishes. thus, we impose the
no-scalar hair condition:

b(t, ) = 0,
1
2 = r a(t, ) + b(t, ) + o(r1).

(46)

(47)

we must check whether the no-scalar hair condition is preserved under
the action of the conformal group (27). suppose b = 0 in some coordinate
system satisfying eqs.(24) and (25). using the transformation (27), we obtain

lie(2) = l2,

= 2r t ++ + t  

+t + + t 

2

! a(t, )

+2(cid:16)t ++ + t (cid:17) b(t, ) + o(r1).

(48)

11

thus the transformed  also satises the no-scalar hair condition. there-
fore, the hamiltonian h with the well-dened functional derivative is

h[] = h[] + j []

(49)

under the asymptotically ads3 conditions and the no-scalar hair condition.
note that we need only the leading order terms of  in 1/r to evaluate the
charges j [].

the mass and angular momentum of a black hole are given by

m = j [t] = j [l0] + j [ l0]
j = j [] = j [l0]  j [ l0].

l

,

(50)

(51)

because we use the zero-mass black hole as the reference geometry, m =
1/8g for the globally ads3.

we obtain the same surface term as the one for pure gravity; thus the
central charge coincides with the pure gravity one by applying the same argu-
ment as brown and henneaux. we present their argument for completeness.
using the dirac bracket { , }db for the constraints h  0, the algebra of
the asymptotic symmetry becomes

{j [1], j [2]}db = j [ [1, 2] ] + k[1, 2],

(52)

where k[1, 2] is the central charge. the left-hand side is just the change
in the charge j [1] under the surface deformation generated by j [2], that
is,

{j [1], j [2]}db = l2j [1] = lie(2)j [1].

(53)

the central charge may be obtained from eq.(52), which is most easily eval-

g. because the
uated on the t = 0 surface of the reference spacetime
charge has been chosen so that it vanishes for the reference spacetime, then
j [ [1, 2] ] = 0 and the charge j [1], before the surface is deformed, is also
zero. thus, substituting q = lie(2)


g into eq. (45), we get

k[1, 2] = lie(2)j [1]

that is,

c

n3 n+m, 0.

(57)

the same holds for ln. thus we have the same central charge c = 3l/2g as
pure gravity.

note that the virasoro algebra (57) has a non-standard form [26]. this
is because the zero-mass black hole is used as the reference spacetime. if we
take the globally ads3 as the reference spacetime, then j n s[l0] = j [l0] +
c/24, where j n s is the new charge using the globally ads3 as the reference.
the new charges j n s[lm] = j [lm] + n, 0 c/24 have the usual form of the
virasoro algebra:

i nj n s[ln], j n s[lm]odb
4 discussion

= (nm)j n s[ln+m]+

c
12

n(n21) n+m, 0. (58)

we found that the central charge and the l0 eigenvalues of the black hole are
unchanged from pure gravity results. thus, if one simply applies stromingers
derivation, the asymptotic density of states estimated by the asymptotic
symmetry group is the same as the pure gravity result:

sasymp = 4s c

6

= 2ls m

2g

.

(59)

13

thus, the functional form agrees with (15), but the overall numerical coe-
cient does not.

4.1 maximum possible entropy

note sasymp > sbh ; this is because sasymp gives the maximum possible
entropy [17]. there is another solution in this theory, the btz black hole,
which saturates the bound sasymp = sbh. since stromingers argument
is insensitive to the details of the interior structure, the virasoro algebra
predicts the same answer for the btz black hole and for the mz black hole.
so, the cft answer cannot be true for both solutions. the cft prediction
gives the numerical value of the larger entropy solution for a given mass.

then, one may be tempted to think that all we have done is just to
rederive the btz black hole entropy in this theory, not the mz black hole.
however, if the cft prediction simply gives the maximum possible entropy,
the entropy of the mz black hole does not have to have the same functional
form as cardys formula. we believe that the fact that the functional form of
the mz black hole entropy agrees with the cft prediction indicates that the
cft prediction gives the correct functional form even if a black hole entropy
does not saturate the bound sasymp  sbh .

there still remains the question why the approach gives the maximum
possible entropy. one possible answer is that we are counting the entropy
from the matter eld as well and somehow have to subtract them. the
counting of matter entropy has been computed by various authors using
the brick-wall model [27] and it is consistent with the area formula in most
cases. thus, subtracting the matter entropy from sasymp changes only the
numerical coecient. however, such a computation generally depends on the
regularization scheme.

4.2 lowest virasoro eigenvalues

stromingers argument is impressive, but the derivation actually has several
assumptions [6]. one important point is the lowest virasoro eigenvalues; in

14

order to use cardys formula, the lowest l0 eigenvalues of the cft should
be 0 = 0 = 0.

if the cft is unitary, n s

0  0 so that there is no state with negative
weights. for the btz black hole, the unitarity of the boundary cft could
be guaranteed by the underlying string theory with a ramond-ramond (r-
r) background. on the other hand, the unitarity of our boundary cft is
not clear.

this assumption is usually justied by regarding the btz black hole as
excitations from the reference spacetime [3] [either the globally ads3 or the
zero-mass black hole (20)]; because a reference geometry has zero mass and
angular momentum by denition, it has  =  = 0. in this interpretation,
the reference geometry is a highest weight state of the cft. we assume that
such a reference geometry has the lowest eigenvalues.

however, it is a dierent issue whether the zero-mass black hole (20) or the
globally ads3 is the highest weight state which produces the mz solution.
in fact, it does not seem so. one can easily obtain the general virasoro
deformation using the asymptotic killing vector (27)[15]. because the killing
vector (27) and the geometry are the same as pure gravity, the most general
deformation is the same as well. this includes the btz solution, but does not
include the mz solution since the scalar  transforms as lie = (3) = 0.
so, one can make only the btz black hole in this way. thus, one may again
conclude that we can only rederive the btz black hole entropy in this theory.
this is not a problem. cardys formula sums over all states in the cft,
i.e., the members of all conformal families. when there are many verma
modules, we do not know a priori which highest weight states we should
choose. the zero-mass black hole does not have to be the highest weight
state we are looking for; the derivation only requires that there is a highest
weight state which produces the black hole in question.

it is not clear whether there is a geometry which produces the mz black
hole by the virasoro deformation. 2 it is not clear either whether only one
highest weight state produces the black hole. however, we do not know such
2one possible candidate is the zero-mass black hole metric (20) with  = c/r, where

c is a constant. this is a solution of eqs. (5) and (8).

15

a map between the classical deformations and the cft description really
makes sense. anyway, the whole eect is an additive constant in the mass.
so, we simply assume that there is a highest weight state which produces
the mz solution.
if the cft is unitary, all states lie in highest weight
representations, so there should be such a state.

there is another problem. equation (59) counts all states in the cft
with the same l0 eigenvalues. thus, one might suspect that we are counting
the btz black hole entropy as well since both black holes have the same set
of charges. we have no conclusive answer; we simply assume that these black
holes somehow belong to the dierent sectors.

4.3 other approaches

in order to really understand the issue, it is desirable to have a microscopic
description. moreover, with such a description, one may be able to keep track
of the conformal anomaly, i.e., the anomaly induced on the eective string
on a brane intersection, the anomaly transported to innity via anomaly
inow mechanism, and the anomaly of the boundary cft. so, one can check
whether the asymptotic cft is really reected on the horizon. thus, it would
be interesting to embed some asymptotically ads3 solutions in string theory
(whose near-horizon geometry is not ads3). the solutions should necessarily
be supersymmetric in order that the anomaly on the brane makes sense.

even though we fail to reproduce the numerical coecient of the bekenstein-

hawking entropy, it may be possible to reproduce it using a dierent method.
one possible approach is the chern-simons formalism [28]; the analysis has
been claimed to be valid for a boundary located on any surface of constant
r, in particular for the horizon. however, it is not clear how to choose the
dieomorphisms at the horizon. (their dieomorphisms reduce to brown-
henneauxs asymptotic isometries at innity.)

another approach is carlips method, which is inspired by stromingers
analysis [17, 29]. he found a virasoro algebra with a central charge which
corresponds to the algebra of surface deformation of the r  t plane that

16

leaves the horizon xed. the central charge is given by

c =

3a
2g

.

(60)

the method applies to any black hole in any dimensions but applies only to
pure gravity. it is interesting to see whether walds formula is reproduced
when applied to gravity with various elds.

a the classical limit and expansion param-

eters

we consider a number of dierent expansions in this paper. in this section,
we describe these expansions in detail. for simplicity, we consider black holes
with r = 0.

for the btz and the mz black hole, the various length scales are related

to physical quantities as follows (we neglect numerical coecients):

r2
+
l2 ,

,

l
g
1
g
r+
l2 ,
r+
,
g

c 
m 
t 
sbh 

17

(61)

(62)

(63)

(64)

1. semiclassical limit of pure gravity:

the semiclassical limit requires c  1 [3] and thus

l  g.

(65)

2. cardys formula:

cardys formula is an asymptotic formula valid at high energy. thus
one expects the formula is valid when

and this implies

l0 = lm  c

r+  l.

(66)

(67)

0 = lm + c

the condition is also necessary if we regard the globally ads3 as the
state with the lowest virasoro eigenvalues. then, the black hole mass
is given by ln s
24 , where m is the mass measured from the
r-r ground state (the zero-mass black hole). thus, cardys formula
0 /6 is not the same as sbh due to the additive constant.

s = 4qcln s
in order to neglect the constant, one again must require lm  c.
one can also rewrite the condition as t  1/l. this condition is
actually too strong for d1/d5 system [31] since this implies n  q1q5.
(c = 6q1q5 and lm = n) the eective string description of d1/d5 is
valid even when n  q1q5; this is the region where multiply wound
strings dominate the entropy.

3. backreaction of the emitted radiation:

the standard treatment of black hole radiation neglects the backre-
action of the radiation on the black hole. this is not possible if the
emission changes the hawking temperature by an amount comparable
to the temperature [32]. thus, the heat capacity c = |e/t| has to
satisfy

c  1.

18

(68)

by the rst law, this can be written as |t s/t|  1; the entropy
of the hole within the given thermal energy interval should be large.
thus,

r+  g

(69)

conversely, the thermodynamics will only break down when the tem-
perature is so low that c  1. this happens at a temperature t 
g/l2  1/(lc).
in order for the black hole to be able to radiate at
such low temperature, the mass gap for the theory should be of order
m  g/l2 [33]. this is a very long length scale; for d1/d5 system,
this mass gap comes from multiply wound strings.

4. fluctuation of the geometry:

in order to neglect the uctuation of the black hole geometry,

r+  rc,

(70)

where rc = 1/m is the compton wavelength of the black hole. this
implies

r3
+  gl2.

(71)

if we recover h, g has a dimension of (mass)1. so the planck mass
should not be 1/g since this does not have a h. it is impossible to form
a mass scale from g and h alone, so (h2/(gl2))1/3 should be the planck
mass. if either r+  l or r+  g, then this condition implies another.

in order for all expansions to be valid [3],

r+  l  g.

(72)

for the schwarzschild black hole, the conditions 3 and 4 both imply r+ 
g.

since we have two basic length scales l and g, one can form a variety
of length scales [34]. the length scales appeared in the above discussion are
related by

l2
g  l  (l2g)1/3  g.

b the central charge from boundary stress

tensor

the central charge of ads3 found in the hamiltonian formalism [4] has been
reproduced by various authors. see refs. [28] in the chern-simons formalism
and refs. [13, 35, 36] in the framework of ads/cft correspondence [8, 9, 10].
it would be interesting to obtain the central charge using the ads/cft
correspondence. one possible approach is a boundary stress tensor proposal
by balasubramanian and kraus [35].

their starting point is the quasilocal stress tensor proposal by brown
and york [37]. in order to obtain a denition of the mass, they proposed a
tensor dened on the boundary of a given spacetime:

t ab =

2



s
ab

,

(74)

where ab is the boundary metric and a, b = t, . the boundary metric is
dened by writing the metric in an adm-like decomposition:

ds2 = n 2dr2 + abdxadxb.

(75)

the resulting stress tensor typically diverges.
in order to obtain a nite
stress tensor, they propose a subtraction by embedding a boundary with the
same intrinsic geometry ab in some reference spacetime.

in light of ads/cft correspondence, balasubramanian and kraus have

interpreted eq. (74) as

ht abi =

sef f
ab

,

(76)

2



where ht abi is the expectation value of the cft stress tensor. then, the
divergences which appear are simply the standard ultraviolet divergences of
a quantum eld theory and may be removed by adding local counterterms to
the action which depend only on the boundary cft [9]. on the other hand,
the stress tensor of a two-dimensional cft has a trace anomaly

t (cf t ) = 

c
12

(2)r,

20

(77)

where c is the central charge and (2)r is the two-dimensional ricci scalar.
thus, one can reproduce the central charge using this prescription.

however, in our case, we do not know the underlying boundary cft so
that it is not clear how to choose the counterterm action. in particular, we
do not know what the conformal scalar corresponds to in cft language.

one could go back to the original brown-york prescription and try to
nd a suitable reference action and a reference spacetime. however, the
prescription has drawbacks:
it is not always possible to nd an embedding
and even if it is, such an embedding may not be unique. moreover, it is not
clear how to choose the reference action for gravity with scalar elds. as
far as we are aware, there are three dierent prescriptions for the reference
action [38, 39, 40, 41, 42]:

1. ccm-ci [40]: they have proposed the reference action from the require-
ment that mass is conformally invariant. however, the mass does not
converge for the mz solution if one chooses the zero-mass black hole as
the reference spacetime. (we always choose the zero-mass black hole
as the reference spacetime in this discussion.)

2. ccm-hh [40]: this prescription is motivated by the hawking-horowitz
(hh) proposal [43] to dene mass. for the mz solution, the mass is
nite and is same as the one obtained in the hamiltonian formalism.
however, the mass is not conformally invariant.

3. bose-lohiya [42]: this prescription is also motivated by the hh pro-
posal, but mass is conformally invariant. for the mz solution, the mass
is nite, but does not agree with the hamiltonian formalism.

in conclusions, none of the prescriptions seem to be well-dened and can
be used for our purposes. however, it would be interesting to study along
this line further; this would give us a well-dened prescription of mass for
gravity with scalar elds.
