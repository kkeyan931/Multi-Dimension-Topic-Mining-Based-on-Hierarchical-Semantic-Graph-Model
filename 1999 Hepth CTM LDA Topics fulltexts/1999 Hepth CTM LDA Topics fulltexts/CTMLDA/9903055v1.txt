abstract

spin-2 gauge theories are constructed without any classical input from general relativity
by means of perturbative gauge invariance. we start from a general ansatz for the couplings
and derive constraints from rst order gauge invariance. we nd 15 conditions which are
necessary for any spin-2 gauge theory. one solution is quantum gravity, but there are others.

1 introduction

the conventional quantum eld theoretical approach to quantum gravity starts from the einstein
- hilbert lagrangian

where r = g r is the ricci scalar and 2 = 32g (g= newtons constant). it is convenient
to work with goldberg variables [1]

leh =

gr

g = gg

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

(1.4)

which one expands in an asymptotically at geometry, for simplicity,

g =  + h

( = minkowski metric). then leh (1.1) becomes an innite power series in 

leh =



xj=0

jl(j)
eh.

the lowest order l(0)
gauge h

eh is quadratic in h (x) and denes the free asymptotic elds. in the hilbert
 = 0 which corresponds to the goldberg variables (1.3), h obeys the wave equation

the rst order term l(1)

eh gives the trilinear coupling [2, 3]

h (x) = 0.

eh = 1

 ).

(1.5)

(1.6)

here, as always, we use the convention of writing the derivatives downstairs, all other lorentz
indices are written upstairs (sometimes we then also omit the comma). the derivatives are
ordinary partial derivatives because we work in a at background. after quantisation, the
coupling (1.6), completed by suitable ghost - graviton couplings, can be used in perturbation
theory to calculate quantum corrections to classical general relativity [4]. there are two serious
drawbacks in this procedure. the rst is the non-renormalisability of the theory due to the two
derivatives in each term in (1.6) and the second one is the innite sum (1.4). the latter so-called
proliferation of couplings shows the non-polynomial character of the interaction which is hard
to understand on the quantum level. one would like to know whether these disturbing features
are consequences of the particular classical starting point (1.1) or whether they are genuine
properties of any spin-2 quantum gauge theory.

to study this question we shall use an approach to gauge theories which works without any
classical input. this method which we have worked out for spin-1 non-abelian gauge theories
(massless [5] and massive [6]) in last years proceeds as follows: after specifying the fundamental
elds we write down the most general trilinear coupling t1 which is compatible with lorentz
covariance, power counting and certain basic symmetries (like zero ghost number for example).
then we impose rst order gauge invariance which strongly restricts the form of t1.
in the
perturbative construction of the s-matrix we next have to calculate the time-ordered product
t{t1(x)t1(y)} = t2(x, y) by means of causality [7]. then second order gauge invariance gives

2

further restrictions, in particular, it requires quartic normalisation terms of the form l(2)
eh in the
above expansion [8], and so on. in this way the proliferation of couplings can be overcome. in
this paper we want to carry through this program for massless spin-2 theories.

the paper is organized as follows.

in the next section we introduce perturbative gauge
invariance. as a rst application we show that the trilinear self-coupling of the symmetric
tensor-eld must necessarily be of the non-renormalisable type with two derivatives. in section
3 we set up the general spin-2 theory by writing down all possible couplings, including ghost-
couplings and q-vertices. in the fourth section the consequences of rst order gauge invariance
are analysed. we derive 15 important necessary conditions for spin-2 gauge theories. in the last
section we discuss special solutions satisfying the necessary conditions and verify that they are
also gauge invariant to second order. we recover quantum gravity in a compact formulation,
but there exist further spin-2 gauge theories. the classication of all spin-2 gauge theories will
be left to a separate paper. the most important result of this study is the observation that
perturbative gauge invariance is really universal: it governs all interactions in nature, including
gravity.

2 perturbative gauge invariance

our fundamental free asymtotic elds are a symmetric tensor eld h (x) and ghost and
antighost elds u(x), u(x). we do not assume that h has something to do with the metric
tensor (1.3). of course, the ten independent components of h contain more than the ve
independent components of a spin-2 eld. the additional freedom can be reduced by a gauge
condition h
 = 0 and a trace condition h = h = 0 [9], but those conditions are disregarded
in the construction of the gauge theory. they enter at a later stage when physical states are
dened.

the h-eld is quantised as follows

with

[h(x), h (y)] = ib d(x  y)

b = 1

2 ( +     ).

(2.1)

(2.2)

d(x) is the mass-zero jordan - pauli distribution. in complete analogy to spin-1 theories one
introduces a gauge charge

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

q def= z

d3x h




 0u.

in order to get a nilpotent q

x0=t

q2 = 0,

we have to quantise the ghost elds with anticommutators

and zero otherwise. all asymptotic elds full the wave equation

{u(x), u (y)} = i d(x  y)

h (x) = 0 = u(x) = u(x).

3

the gauge charge q (2.3) denes a gauge variation according to

dqf def= qf  (1)nf f q,

(2.7)

where nf is the number of ghost plus anti-ghost elds in the wick monomial f . we get the
following gauge variations of the fundamental elds

dqh = 

i

dqh = iu
,
dqu = 0,

(u

 + u

   u
)
 = 0
dq u = ih
 .

dqh

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

the result (2.8) agrees with innitesimal gauge transformations of the goldberg variables (1.3),
so that our choice of q (2.3) corresponds to the classical framework described in the introduction.
the asymptotic elds will be used to construct the time-ordered products tn in the adiabat-

ically switched s-matrix

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

1

n! z d4x1 . . . d4xn tn(x1, . . . , xn)g(x1) . . . g(xn),

(2.11)

where g(x) is a schwartz test function. as is well known, the tns can be expressed by normally
ordered products of asymptotic elds. it is a very important fact that gauge invariance of the
s-matrix can be directly formulated with help of the tns. first order gauge invariance means
that dqt1 is a divergence

dqt1(x) = it 

1/1(x).

(2.12)

the t 
then reads as follows

1/1 appearing here is the so-called q-vertex. the denition of n-th order gauge invariance

dqtn = [q, tn] = i

n

xl=1

l

t 
n/l(x1, . . . xl . . . xn).

(2.13)

here t 
ordinary vertices t1.

n/l is the time-ordered product with a q-vertex at xl, while all other n  1 vertices are
as an illustration of this concept let us consider the general trilinear coupling of the h-eld

and ghosts without derivatives

t1 = a1hhh + a2hh h + a3h hh

+b1u uh + b2u uh .

(2.14)

as always, h = h is the trace of the tensor eld. all products in (2.14) and throughout are
normally ordered products, we always omit the double dots. we also make a general ansatz for
the q-vertex which has ghost number one

t 
1/1 = c1uhh + c2uhh + c3uhh + c4uhh.

this form is restricted by nilpotency

qt1 = dqt 
d2

1/1 = 0.

(2.15)

(2.16)

if we insert (2.15) and set the coecients of all wick monomials equal to zero, we get a linear
homogeneous system of equations for the cj in (2.15). the system is overdetermined and has
the trivial solution only. consequently, the simple coupling (2.14) without derivatives does not
lead to a gauge theory. with one derivative we cannot form lorentz scalars, therefore, we are
forced to consider the non-renormalisable case of two derivatives.

if we add two derivatives in (2.14) and (2.15) in all possible ways, the theory becomes very
big. it is therefore important to use every mean to keep it smaller. one such tool is a result of
dutsch [10]. let

fphys = kerq/ranq

(2.17)

be the physical subspace of the big fock space where the asymptotic elds are dened [11], and
p the projection operator onto fphys. then the following theorem holds

theorem let t1 and t 0

1 dier by a divergence coupling

t1(x) = t 0

1 (x) + t 

1 (x).

(2.18)

then the chronological products tn(x1, . . . xn) and t 0
respectively, satisfy

n (x1, . . . xn) constructed from t1 and t 0
n ,

p tnp = p t 0

n p + div.

(2.19)

since the divergence in (2.19) has no physical consequences (in the formal adiabatic limit
g  1, for example), the theorem means that the two theories are physically equivalent. this
enables us to simplify the coupling t1 by addition of suitable divergences.

3 the general spin-2 theory

first we set up the trilinear self-coupling t h
1 of the h-eld. when we distribute the two deriva-
tives on the three h-elds we observe that we always get a divergence if the two derivatives are
with respect to the same coordinate. for example, we have
 hh)  h

 h = (h

 hh
 ,

h

taking the wave equation (2.6) into account.
becomes equal to the l.h.s., hence

if we interchange  and  in the last term it

h
 h

 h = 1

2 (h

 hh).

(3.2)

if we have a double derivative at one h, it can be transformed into two terms with single
derivatives on two h-elds plus a divergence. consequently, the general form of t h
1 modulo
divergences consists of the following twelve terms only

t h
1 = a1h

 hh + a2hhh + a3h

 h

 h + a4h

 hh

 h

 h
 + a12hh
 .
similarly, we can write down the general ansatz for the ghost coupling t u
1 which contains

 h + a6h
 h + a10h

+a5hh
 h

 h
 hh

 h + a8hh

 + a11hh

 h + a7h

now comes the big list which is the ansatz for the q-vertex t

what follows to group the terms according to their lorentz structure in the upper indices. we
distiguish 10 dierent lorentz types a-k:

again the nilpotency (2.16) gives very many linear relations between the coecients cj, so
that nally only about 40 are linear independent. fortunately, it is not necessary to work this
out for the following.

to impose rst order gauge invariance (2.12) we have to calculate

(4.1)

the coecients dj herein are linear combinations of the cj above. the three commas indicate
the three derivatives on the eld operators. the equation (4.1) can be decomposed into the
dierent lorentz types a-k as before. the types e,f and g are the most important ones and
we must analyse them in detail.

4.1 type e

calculating the divergence e in (3.10) and collecting terms with the same wick monomial
we obtain the following result (to save space we write the index j of dj as a lower index at the
bracket of the corresponding cs; for example (c42 + c48)29 means d29 = c42 + c48):

(4.2)

the last three terms with indices in brackets d(41), d(42), d(43) have triple derivatives and will
vanish if rst order gauge invariance is imposed.

solving the linear equations between the ds and cs for the ck, we make the important
observation that the ds are linearly dependent. this is not the case for the types a-d. for type
e we nd the following 6 relations, or linear combinations of them:

d30  d31  d37 + d39 + d40  2d41  d42 + 2d43 = 0

d29  d31  d32 + d33  d35  d37 + d38 + d40  d41 + d43 = 0

d29  d31 + d40  d41  d(41) + d43 = 0
d38  d39 + d41 + d42  d(42)  d43 = 0
d35  d36  d38 + d39  d41  d(43) = 0

d29  d31  d32 + d34 + d35  d36  d38 + d39  d41 + d43 = 0.

which gives the following ve linear relation between the ds:

d60  d61 + d63 + d65  d66  d(71) = 0

from the remaining types h, j, and k which contain only ghost elds h and k give no
linear dependence between the ds. type j gives four relations, but after substituting the ds
by as and bs by means of rst order gauge invariance (see below) these relations are linear
combinations of the relations above. therefore we do not write them down.

2 a10 + a11 = b13  b14 + b15  b20.

from typ f we obtain four relations

a6 = a5

(4.30) 2(a3  a4) + a11 + a12 = 2b1 + b3 + 2b5  b6

a9 + a10 = 2(b1  b2 + b3)

(4.32) a4 + a5 = 2b1 + b2  b3  b4

finally typ g gives us the following ve relations

a4  a5 + 2a6 = 2(b7  b8 + b9)

2a1 + a4  a5 + 2a6 + a7 = 2(b8 + b9  b10)

b11 = b8

(4.36)

b12 = b9

(4.37) a8 = 2a2.

these 15 relations are necessary conditions which must be fulled by any spin-2 gauge theory. in
the next section we investigate for some interesting special cases whether they are also sucient.

5 special spin-2 gauge theories

it is not hard to nd solutions of the necessary conditions with only a few coupling constants
dierent from zero. for example a3 and b5 appear in (4.31), only, so that a3 = b5 with all other
constants zero is a candidate. the corresponding theory

t1 = a3(h

 h

 h + u

 uh

 ) = ia3dq(uh

 h)

(5.1)

is a coboundary. it is gauge invariant also to second order. but it has a trivial s-matrix on the
physical subspace, so that this theory is not very interesting.

the coecients a1 and b10 occur in (4.35), only, therefore a1 = b10 and zero otherwise gives

another simple theory. this theory

t1 = a1(h

 hh  u

 u

h)

is very interesting. it has a non-trivial q-vertex

t 
1/1 = a1u

 h.

(5.2)

(5.3)

we therefore look at second order gauge invariance. here we have to examine whether local
terms that violate gauge invariance (anomalies) can be compensated by suitable normalisation.
the procedure has been described in previous papers (see [8] for example).

the anomalies come from the following commutator between t 

1/1(x) and t1(y)

where 1 is a free normalisation constant. choosing 1 = 1, the rst two terms vanish, but
the last one remains. fortunately, the latter is a coboundary, in fact, with

we have

n1 = 1hhhh

(5.6)

(5.7)

with 1 = 2a2
1/3 the anomaly (5.5) cancels completely. in this way the additional coupling
(5.6) is generated by gauge invariance. the proliferation of couplings in higher orders is managed
in a similar way. one may object that n1 is not a proper normalisation term because it does not
occur in second order starting from the simple coupling (5.2). but we can modify this coupling
by adding a divergence without changing the physics

1 = t1 + c(h
t

= t1 + c(h

 hh + 2h

 hh).

(5.8)

here the last term agrees with the original coupling in (5.2) and the rst term in the bracket
now gives rise to the normalisation term (5.6): consider two such vertices in a second order tree
graph with one h
 and one h contracted, then the c-number distribution has singular order
 = 0 and the splitting solution can freely be changed by the term (5.6). summing up, the
simple theory (5.2) or (5.8) is a perfect spin-2 gauge theory which shows all essential features.
now we turn to a bigger theory. let us assume that a2 6= 0, then by (4.38) we have
a8 = 2a2. to satisfy (4.25) we keep a9 = 0 so that a12 = 2a8 = 4a2. then from (4.24) we
nd b19 = a12 = 4a2 and from (4.31) b5 = a12/2 = 2a2, so that

we claim that this is quantum gravity! indeed, choosing a2 = 1/4, then t h
1 agrees with the
rst three terms in (1.6). the last two terms in (1.6) with the same derivatives downstairs
are divergences as mentioned above (3.1). they can freely be added without changing the
physics. with (5.9-10) we have the most compact formulation of quantum gravity with only
three graviton and two ghost vertices. the ghost coupling (5.10) has already been obtained
by schorn [12]. he has also veried that the theory is gauge invariant regarding second order
tree graphs and that the necessary normalisation terms agree with the 4-graviton coupling l(2)
eh
derived from the einstein - hilbert lagrangian (1.4). we will return to this in more detail in a
separate paper. the gauge invariance of loop graphs has been investigated by grillo [13].
