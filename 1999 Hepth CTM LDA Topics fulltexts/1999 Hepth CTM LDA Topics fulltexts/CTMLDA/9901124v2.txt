one-instanton predictions for the prepotential are obtained from the seiberg-witten
curve for the coulomb branch of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory for the product
n=1 su(nn) with a massless matter hypermultiplet in the bifundamental
representation (nn, nn+1) of su(nn)  su(nn+1) for n = 1 to m  1, together with
n0 and nm+1 matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental representations of su(n1)
and su(nm) respectively. the derivation uses a generalization of the systematic
perturbation expansion about a hyperelliptic curve developed by us in earlier work.

spectacular advances have been made in our understanding of the non-perturbative behavior

of supersymmetric gauge theories and string theories. in particular, the program of seiberg and

witten [1] allows one to compute the exact behavior of low-energy four-dimensional n = 2

supersymmetric gauge theories in various regions of moduli space from the following input: a

riemann surface or algebraic curve appropriate to the specic theory, and the seiberg-witten

meromorphic one-form. when the curve in question is non-hyperelliptic, however, the explicit

extraction of this information is a challenging technical problem.

in this letter, we will use

seiberg-witten theory to calculate the one-instanton predictions of an n = 2 supersymmetric

gauge theory based on the product group qm

n=1 su(nn) by extending the methods of ref. [2]-[7].

the exact low-energy properties of n = 2 theories are encapsulated in the form of the

prepotential f(a), in terms of which the wilson eective lagrangian is

to lowest order in the momentum expansion, where ai are n = 1 chiral superelds and w i are

n = 1 vector superelds. holomorphy implies that the prepotential in the coulomb phase has

the form of an instanton expansion

f(a) = fcl(a) + f1loop(a) +

fdinst(a).

(2)

consider an n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory based on the gauge groupqm

addition to the chiral gauge multiplet in the adjoint representation of each of the factor groups,

n=1 su(nn). in

the theory we are considering contains a massless matter hypermultiplet in the bifundamental

representation (nn, nn+1) of su(nn)su(nn+1) for n = 1, . . . , m1; n0 matter hypermultiplets

in the fundamental representation of su(n1) (whose masses we denote e(0)

k , 1  k  n0); and

nm+1 matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of su(nm) (whose masses we

denote e(m+1)

k

, 1  k  nm+1). the adjoint multiplets contain complex scalar elds (n) for

each of the factor groups. the lagrangian has a potential with at directions, along which the

symmetry is generically broken to qm

n=1 u(1)nn1. the moduli space of the theory is therefore

(1  k  nn, 1  n  m), which are the eigenvalues

the curve for this product group theory was obtained using m-theory [8] and geometric

engineering [9], and made more explicit in ref. [10]:

(4)

with n the quantum scale of the gauge group su(nn). the requirement of asymptotic freedom,

and restriction to the coulomb phase, implies that n appear with positive powers in (3).

the curve (3) describes a (m + 1)-fold branched covering of the riemann sphere, with sheets

n and n + 1 connected by nn square-root branch-cuts centered about x = e(n)

(k = 1 to nn),

and having endpoints x(n)

on one of the sheets, eq. (9) has the solution

y = a  r

to obtain the one-instanton correction (i.e., o(l2

again makes the change of variables t = y/pnn1 (x) in eq. (8), and keeps two more terms

beyond those in eq. (9), obtaining the quartic curve

naive sum of instanton contributions from each subgroup.

the one-loop prepotential (23) agrees with the perturbation theory result for a chiral gauge

multiplet in the adjoint representation of each of the factor groups, a massless matter hypermul-

tiplet in the bifundamental representation (nn, nn+1) of su(nn) su(nn+1) for n = 1 to m  1,

n0 matter hypermultiplets with masses a(0)

k

in the fundamental representation of su(n1), and

nm+1 matter hypermultiplets with masses a(m+1)

k

in the fundamental representation of su(nm).

one check of the one-instanton correction (24) is provided by ref. [4], where various de-

coupling limits for n = 2 su(n ) gauge theory with a massive hypermultiplet in the adjoint

representation are considered. dhoker and phong [4] obtain f1inst for the product group the-

ory, but with restriction to a single quantum scale. we nd agreement with their result when we

restrict eqs. (24) and (25) to the special case of a single quantum scale, which therefore provides

a test of the curve (3) obtained from m-theory.

in this paper, we showed that to compute the order parameters of the n = 2 gauge theory for

the product group qm

n=1 su(nn) to one-instanton accuracy, one need only consider the sequence

of quartic curves (13), even though the complete curve for the theory (3) is of higher order (viz.,

m + 1) for m > 3, i.e., for products of three or more groups. (the case m = 2 was analyzed in

ref. [7].) in the language of type iia string theory, this means one need only consider all possible

chains of four parallel neighboring ns 5-branes, among the total set of m+1 parallel ns 5-branes,

to achieve one-instanton accuracy. for higher instanton accuracy, additional parallel 5-branes

are required. an analogue of this result plays a crucial role in our analysis of the prepotential

and seiberg-witten curve for su(n ) gauge theory with two antisymmetric and nf fundamental

hypermultiplets [11].
