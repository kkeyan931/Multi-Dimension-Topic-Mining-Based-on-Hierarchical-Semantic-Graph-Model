abstract

we consider the role of boundary conditions in the adsd+1/cf td correspon-
dence for the scalar eld theory. also a careful analysis of some limiting cases
is presented. we study three possible types of boundary conditions, dirichlet,
neumann and mixed. we compute the two-point functions of the conformal
operators on the boundary for each type of boundary condition. we show how
particular choices of the mass require dierent treatments. in the dirichlet case
we nd that there is no double zero in the two-point function of the operator
with conformal dimension d
2 . the neumann case leads to new normalizations for
the boundary two-point functions. in the massless case we show that the con-
formal dimension of the boundary conformal operator is precisely the unitarity
bound for scalar operators. we nd a one-parameter family of boundary condi-
tions in the mixed case. there are again new normalizations for the boundary
two-point functions. for a particular choice of the mixed boundary condition

1 introduction

since the proposal of maldacenas conjecture, which gives a correspondence between a
eld theory on anti-de sitter space (ads) and a conformal eld theory (cft) on its
boundary [1], an intensive work has been devoted to get a deeper understanding of its
implications. in particular, a precise form to the conjecture has been given in [2][3]. it
reads

zads[0] = z0 d exp (i[])  zcf t [0] = (cid:28)exp(cid:18)z

ddxo0(cid:19)(cid:29) ,

(1)

where 0 is the boundary value of the bulk eld  which couples to the boundary cft
operator o. this allows us to obtain the correlation functions of the boundary cft
theory in d dimensions by calculating the partition function on the adsd+1 side. the
ads/cft correspondence has been studied for the scalar eld [3][4][5][6], the vector
eld [3][5][7][8], the spinor eld [7][9][10], the rarita-schwinger eld [11][12][13], the
graviton eld [14][15], the massive symmetric tensor eld [16] and the antisymmetric
p-form eld [17][18].
in all cases dirichlet boundary conditions were used. several
subtle points have been claried in these papers and all results lend support to the
conjecture.

in a broader sense maldacenas conjecture is a concrete realization of the holo-
graphic principle [19][20]. we expect that any eld theory relationship in ads space
must be reected in the border cft. an example of this is the well known equivalence
between maxwell-chern-simons theory and the self-dual model in three dimensional
minkowski space [21]. this equivalence holds also in ads3 and using the ads/cft
correspondence we have shown that the corresponding boundary operators have the
same conformal dimensions [8]. another situation involves massive scalar elds in ads
spaces. if the scalar eld has mass-squared in the range d2/4 < m2 < d2/4 + 1
then there are two possible quantum eld theories in the bulk [22]. the ads/cft
correspondence with dirichlet boundary condition can easily account for one of the
theories. the other one appears in a very subtle way by identifying a conjugate eld
through a legendre transform as the source of the boundary conformal operator [23].
the existence of two conjugated boundary operators has been rst pointed out in [24].
since a eld theory is determined not only by its lagrangian but also by its bound-
ary terms in the action we expect that the ads/cft correspondence must be sensitive
to these boundary terms. this is easily seen to be true by computing the left-hand side
of eq.(1) for a classical eld conguration. all that is left is a boundary term. if we
start with dierent boundary terms in the action then we obtain dierent correlation
functions on the right-hand side.

1

the origin of boundary terms in the action is due to the variational principle. in
order to have a stationary action boundary terms, which will depend on the choice of
the boundary conditions, must be introduced. the importance of these boundary terms
for the ads/cft correspondence was recognized in the case of spinor elds where the
action is of rst order in derivatives and the classical action vanishes on-shell [25]. they
also played an important role in the case of chern-simons theory [8]. therefore it is
crucial to understand the implications of dierent types of boundary conditions for the
same theory since they in general imply dierent boundary terms.

in this work we will study the role of dierent types of boundary condition for the
scalar eld theory. we will consider dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions, and
a combination of both of them which we will call mixed boundary condition. each
type of boundary condition requires a dierent boundary term. we will show that
the mixed boundary conditions are parametrized by a real number so that there is a
one-parameter family of boundary terms consistent with the variational principle.

we will also show that dierent types of boundary condition give rise to dierent
conformal eld theories at the border. for the scalar eld this was somehow expected.
the two solutions found in [22] correspond to two dierent choices of energy-momentum
tensor. both of them are conserved and their dierence gives a surface contribution to
the isometry generators. although these two solutions were found in the hamiltonian
context by requiring niteness of the energy they will reappear here by considering
dierent types of boundary condition which amounts to dierent boundary terms in
the action. we can also look for the asymptotic behavior of the scalar eld near the
boundary according to the chosen type of boundary condition. for the dirichlet bound-

d/2d2/4+m2

ary condition it is well known that the scalar eld behaves as x
near the
0
border at x0 = 0. there is no upper restriction on the mass in this case. it corre-
sponds to one of the solutions found in [22] and gives rise to a boundary conformal

operator with conformal dimension d/2 + qd2/4 + m2. we will show that for a par-
ticular choice of mixed boundary condition and when the mass squared is in the range
d2/4 < m2 < d2/4 + 1 the scalar eld behaves as x
near the border.
it corresponds precisely to the second solution of [22] and gives rise to a boundary
conformal operator with conformal dimension d/2qd2/4 + m2. note that the upper
limit for the mass squared d2/4 + 1 is consistent with the unitarity bound (d  2)/2.
another important point that we will show is the existence of boundary conditions
which give rise to boundary conformal operators for which the unitarity bound (d 
2)/2 is reached. they correspond to a massless scalar eld with neumann boundary

condition or to a massive scalar eld with m2 > d2/4 + 1 with a particular choice
of the mixed boundary condition (the same choice which gives the boundary operator
with conformal dimension d/2  qd2/4 + m2). in this way, using dierent boundary

conditions, we obtain all scalar conformal eld theories allowed by the unitarity bound.
we will also analyze carefully two cases where the mass of the scalar eld takes
special values. in some cases the usual expansion of the modied bessel functions in
powers of x0 breaks down and we must use expansions involving logarithms. when
m2 = d2/4 it gives rise to the asymptotic behavior xd/2
ln x0 and the two-point
function is obtained without troubles. this is to be contrasted with the usual limiting
procedure where the mass goes to m2 = d2/4 but the two-point function has a double
zero in the limit [23]. the other case corresponds to qd2/4 + m2 integer but non-zero.
in this case we just reproduce the known results.

we should stress the fact that the use of dierent types of boundary condition (for
given values of m2 and d) allows us in general to get boundary two-point functions with
dierent normalizations. this will aect the three-point and higher-point functions.
maybe this is related to the fact that ads and eld theory calculations agree up to some
dimension dependent normalization factors [26] but we will not discuss this further.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we nd the boundary terms corre-
sponding to each type of boundary condition. in section 3 we consider the dirichlet
case while in section 4 we treat neumann boundary conditions. in section 5 we consider
mixed boundary conditions. finally section 6 presents our conclusions. in appendix a
we list all boundary two-point functions that we computed and appendix b contains
some useful formulae.

2 the variational principle

we take the usual euclidean representation of the adsd+1 in poincare coordinates
described by the half space x0 > 0, xi  r with metric

ds2 =

1
x2
0

d

x=0

dxdx.

the action for the massive scalar eld theory is given by

i0 =

1

2 z dd+1xg(cid:16)g + m22(cid:17) ,

(2)

(3)

and the corresponding equation of motion is

(cid:16)2  m2(cid:17)  = 0.
the solution which is regular at x0   reads [5]

(x) = z

where ~x = (x1, ..., xd), k =| ~k |, k is the modied bessel function, and

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

in order to have a stationary action we must supplement the action i0 with a

boundary term is which cancels its variation. the appropriate action is then

i = i0 + is.

(8)

in order to capture the eect of the minkowski boundary of the adsd+1, situated at
x0 = 0, we rst consider a boundary value problem on the boundary surface x0 =  > 0
and then take the limit   0 at the very end. then the variational principle applied
to the action i gives

i = z ddx d+1 0  + is = 0,

(9)

where  and 0 are the value of the eld and its derivate at x0 =  respectively.
this equation will be used below to nd out the appropriate boundary term is for
each type of boundary condition.

for dirichlet boundary condition the variation of the eld at the border vanishes so
that the rst term in eq.(9) also vanishes and the usual action i0 is already stationary.
making use of the eld equation the action i takes the form

id =

1

2 z dd+1x  (g  ) = 

1

2 z ddx d+1  0 .

(10)

4

it is to be understood that 0 in eq.(10) is evaluated in terms of the dirichlet data
.

to consider neumann boundary conditions we rst take a unitary vector which is
inward normal to the boundary n(x0) = (x0, 0). the neumann boundary condition
then xes the value of n()  n. the boundary term to be added to the action
reads
(11)

is = z dd+1x  (g g  ) = z ddx d+1  0 ,

so that we nd the following expression for the action at the boundary

in =

1

2 z ddx d  n .

(12)

here  is to be expressed in terms of the neumann value n. notice that the on-shell
value of the action with neumann boundary condition eq.(12) diers by a sign from
the corresponding action with dirichlet boundary condition eq.(10).

we now consider a boundary condition which xes the value of a linear combination

of the eld and its normal derivative at the border

(x) + n(x)  (x) .

(13)

we will call it as mixed boundary condition. here  is an arbitrary real but non-zero
coecient. in this case the surface term to be added to the action is

i 
s =



2 z dd+1x  (g g n) = 



2 z ddx d+2 0 0 ,

and we nd the following expression for the action at the boundary

i 
m = 

1

2 z ddx d+1 

 0 .

(14)

(15)

clearly 0 in the above expression must be written in terms of the boundary data 
 .
we then have a one-parameter family of surface terms since the variational principle
does not impose any condition on . in this way the value of the on-shell action eq.(15)
also depends on .

in the following sections we will consider each boundary condition separately.

5

3 dirichlet boundary condition

we begin by recalling the main results for the dirichlet case [4][5]. let (~k) be the
fourier transform of the dirichlet boundary value of the eld (x). from eq.(5) we
get

and inserting this into eq.(7) we nd

a(~k) =

2 (~k)
 d
k(k)

,

0(~x) = z ddy (~y)z

then the action eq.(10) reads

(18)

the next step is to keep the relevant terms in the series expansions of the bessel
functions and to integrate in ~k. we consider rst the case  6= 0 that is m2 6=  d2
4 .
for completeness we list the relevant modied bessel functions in appendix b. for
 not integer we make use of eqs.(90,94), whereas for  integer but non-zero we use
eqs.(91,95). in both cases we get the same result

goes as xd/2+1
n0(~x). comparing eqs.(23,37) we see that the conformal dimensions
of the boundary operators for the massless dirichlet and neumann cases are dierent
and for the later case the unitarity bound is reached.

6 conclusions

we have shown how dierent boundary conditions in the ads/cft correspondence
allow us to derive boundary two-point functions which are consistent with the unitarity
bound. we have also done a careful analysis of the particular cases when  is an integer
and we have shown that when  = 0 there are no double zeroes in the two-point
functions.

in general the use of dierent types of boundary conditions lead to boundary two-
point functions with dierent normalizations. it is not clear at this point whether they
are important or not. it is necessary to compute the three-point functions in order to
clarify if the dierent normalizations are leading to dierent boundary cfts.

in the neumann case the unitarity bound is obtained for m = 0 while with mixed
boundary conditions it is reached when  = 0 and m2 > d2/4 + 1. the corresponding
two-point functions have dierent normalizations. the conformal dimension d/2  
is obtained in the case of mixed boundary condition with  = 0 and d2/4 < m2 <
d2/4 + 1, and the normalization of the corresponding boundary two-point function
diers from the one found in [23].
we have also tried to relate our formalism to the legendre transform approach [23].
we could think that both formalisms are related through some eld redenition but
this is not the case. it is not possible to redene the scalar eld in order to turn a
dirichlet boundary condition into a neumann or mixed one. if there is any relation
between the two approaches it must be a very subtle one.

another important point is the interpretation of the new boundary conditions in
the string theory context. dirichlet boundary conditions are natural when thinking
of the asymptotic behavior of the supergravity elds reaching the border of the ads
space. possibly neumann and mixed boundary conditions are related to more complex
solutions involving strings and membranes reaching the border in more subtle ways.
this of course needs a more detailed study.
