abstract

we study, using the dual ads description, the vacua of eld theories where some of the
gauge symmetry is broken by expectation values of scalar elds. in such vacua, operators
built out of the scalar elds acquire expectation values, and we show how to calculate them
from the behavior of perturbations to the ads background near the boundary. specic
examples include the n = 4 sym theory, and theories on d3 branes placed on orbifolds
and conifolds. we also clarify some subtleties of the ads/cft correspondence that arise
in this analysis. in particular, we explain how scalar elds in ads space of suciently
negative mass-squared can be associated with cft operators of two possible dimensions.
all dimensions are bounded from below by (d 2)/2; this is the unitarity bound for scalar
operators in d-dimensional eld theory. we further argue that the generating functional
for correlators in the theory with one choice of operator dimension is a legendre transform
of the generating functional in the theory with the other choice.

1. introduction

the ads/cft correspondence [1,2,3] may be motivated by comparing stacks of ele-
mentary branes with corresponding gravitational backgrounds in string or m-theory. for

example, the correspondence [4] between a large number n of coincident d3-branes and
the 3-brane classical solution leads, after an appropriate low-energy limit is taken, to the
duality between n = 4 supersymmetric su (n ) gauge theory and type iib strings on
ads5  s5 [1,2,3]. this construction gives an explicit realization to the ideas of gauge
theory strings [5,6].

in order to construct the type iib duals of other 4-dimensional cfts, one may place
the d3-branes at appropriate conical singularities [7,8,9,10,11]. then the background dual
to the cft on the d3-branes is ads5  x5 where x5 is the einstein manifold which is
the base of the cone. indeed, the metric of a 6-dimensional cone y6 has the general form

ds2

cone = dr2 + r2ds2
5 .

(1.1)

here y6 is a cone over a ve-manifold x5, and ds2
5 is a metric on x5. if a large number
n of d3-branes is placed at the apex of the cone, that is at r = 0, then the resulting
geometry has the metric

ds2 = h 1/2(dt2 + dx2

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

3) + h 1/2ds2

cone ,

(1.2)

where

h = 1 +

l4
r4 ,

l4  gstn ()2 .

in the near-horizon limit the constant term in h may be ignored and the geometry becomes
ads5  x5 where x5 is the base of the cone. type iib string theory in this background
is then conjectured to be dual to the infrared limit of the eld theory on the stack of
d3-branes. some explicit examples of such duality were exhibited in [12,13,9,11].

in this paper we study in some detail the vacuum states of these cfts in which some

of the gauge symmetry is broken by expectation values of scalar elds. in terms of the
ads description, such vacua arise either by moving the threebranes away from the conical
singularity or from each other, or from the dynamics of the manifold y6, whose singularity
might be either resolved or deformed. these cases are all somewhat similar as, whether
the threebranes are moved or y6 is resolved or deformed, the threebranes tend to end up at
a smooth point in y6. in fact, vacua obtained by resolution, deformation, and threebrane
motion can all be described in an ads language by using metrics that look like ads5  x5
only near innity.

1

these vacua also t in a common framework in the description via boundary conformal
eld theory. they are all obtained by symmetry breaking, that is by giving expectation
values to various scalar elds.

perhaps the simplest example of such gauge symmetry breaking arises in the n = 4
sym theory, by turning on scalar elds such that the gauge group su (n ) is broken
down to s(u (n1) u (n2) . . . u (nk)). in the language of d3-branes, this corresponds to
separating them into k parallel stacks. the appropriate geometry is the k-center threebrane
solution [1,14], and one may once again take a scaling limit which amounts to dropping the
constant term in the greens function h. following [14], we will put the interpretation of
the k-center solution via gauge symmetry breaking on a more precise and systematic basis
by using the general principles of the ads/cft correspondence to compute expectation
values of gauge-invariant order parameters in vacua described by the k-center solution.

a wider range of examples comes from considering threebranes near a conical singu-
larity. the most elementary examples are the orbifold cfts, where the six-dimensional
cone is r6/, with  a discrete subgroup of so(6) [7,12,13]. we denote the elements of
 as i. if the d3-branes are displaced away from the orbifold singularity to a transverse
position ~y0, then the metric is given by

ds2 = h 1/2dx2 + h 1/2(d~y)2 ,

(1.3)

where the greens function is

h = l4

nxi=1

1

|~y  i~y0|4 ,

and the resulting space is subsequently divided by .
(here we are denoting the four
coordinates that parametrize the brane world-volumes as x and the six normal coordinates
as y.) intuitively, if y0 is displaced from all of the orbifold xed points, then this metric
has the same singular structure as that obtained from n d3-branes at a smooth point on
r6. this suggests that the metric describes the ow (via a higgs eect) from an orbifold
eld theory [12,13] at short distances to an su (n ) theory with n = 4 supersymmetry at
long distances. (for instance, if  = zn, the orbifold theory has gauge group s(u (n )n),
which can be broken to a diagonal su (n ) by scalar expectation values.) we will aim to
put this interpretation on a precise and systematic basis by computing the expectation
values of the natural gauge-invariant order parameters.

less elementary is the case that the conical manifold y6 is not simply an orbifold. a
simple case is that y6 may be the conifold singularity in complex dimension three, described
in terms of complex variables w1, . . . , w4 by the equation

a = 0 .

is the metric on the base of the cone [15], which is t 1,1 = (su (2)  su (2))/u (1). the
n = 1 superconformal eld theory with gauge group su (n )  su (n ) that results when
the d3-branes are placed at r = 0, and is dual to ads5  t 1,1, was discussed in detail in
[9,11].

in this example, as anticipated above, symmetry breaking can take several forms. one
may move the threebranes away from r = 0 to a smooth point, or one may resolve the
singularity of y6 to get a smooth manifold y 
6 that looks like y6 near innity (in which
case the threebranes are necessarily at a smooth point).
in either case, assuming the
threebranes are all at the same point, the low energy theory will be the n = 4 su (n )
gauge theory. thus, the model analyzed in [9,11] can ow in the infrared to one of these
vacua. we will analyze the geometries that are relevant to these ows, and compute the
expectation values of chiral superelds in these vacua, getting results that are in agreement
with eld theory analysis [9].

section 2 of this paper is devoted to some details of the ads/cft correspondence
that will arise in our analysis. in particular, we explain how scalar elds in ads space of
suciently negative mass-squared can be associated with cft operators of two possible
dimensions. this subtlety is important for the conifold model, because it contains such
elds in its spectrum. we also formulate, following similar ideas in [16,17,14,18,19], the
general procedure for computing the expectation value of an operator in a quantum vacuum
that is related to a given classical solution. this will be important for our applications to
symmetry breaking. those applications are presented in section 3 for the n = 4 theory
and orbifolds, and in section 4 for the conifold. some technical details of the spectrum for
the conifold are given in an appendix.

2. the mass spectrum and operator dimensions

2.1. two theories from the same lagrangian

the ads/cft correspondence gives the following relation between the mass m of a

scalar in adsd+1 and the dimension  of the corresponding operator [2,3],

(  d) = m2 .

3

(2.1)

there are two solutions,

 =

d

2 r d2

4

+ m2 ,

(2.2)

and it is often assumed that only + is admissible. if true, this would imply that dimen-
sions of scalar operators are bounded from below by d/2, which is more stringent than the
unitarity bound (d  2)/2.

in various explicit examples of the ads/cft duality, however, the eld theory side
contains operators of dimension less than d/2. examples of this include the large n (2, 0)
theory dual to m theory on ads4  s7 where one nds operators of dimension 1 [20], the
f-theory constructions of ads5 duals [21] where one nds dimensions 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, and
the d3-branes on the conifold [9] where there are operators of dimension 3/2. there are
also operators in the d1-d5 system with arbitrarily low dimensions [22,23]. in all these
examples the supersymmetry unambiguously requires the presence of these low dimensions,
all of which are consistent with the unitarity bound but are smaller than d/2. therefore, if
the ads/cft correspondence is correct, then there must be a loophole in the conclusion
that only + is admissible. this issue was raised and discussed in [16], where the relevance
of old work by breitenlohner and freedman [24] was also suggested.

breitenlohner and freedman considered a free scalar eld of mass m in ads space,
and showed that, while for m2 >  d2
4 + 1 there is a unique admissible boundary condition
for such a eld that is invariant under the symmetries of ads space, leading to a unique
ads-invariant quantization, for

d2
4



< m2 < 

d2
4

+ 1

(2.3)

there are two possible quantizations. these two possibilities correspond to the fall-o of
scalar wave functions as z+ and z near z = 0, where the adsd+1 metric is written as

ds2 =

1

z2 dz2 +

(dxi)2! ,

dxi=1

(2.4)

and we set l = 1. breitenlohner and freedman formulated their arguments in hamiltonian
terms and looked for boundary conditions that make the energy nite. instead of repeating
their argument, we will give a heuristic derivation of the result in euclidean space, by
requiring niteness of the action.

the conventional expression for the euclidean action of a massive scalar eld in

adsd+1 is

1

2z dd+1xg(cid:2)g + m22(cid:3) =

1

2z ddxdzzd+1(cid:20)(z)2 + (i)2 +

4

m2

z2 2(cid:21) .

(2.5)

1

2z dd+1xg (2 + m2) .

(2.7)

solutions of the classical equations of motion of this theory behave near z = 0  that is,
near the boundary of ads space  as

(z, ~x)  z(a(~x) + o(z2)),

(2.6)

where  can be either + or . any boundary condition on the eld must set to zero
half of the modes of the eld near the boundary. it is natural and completely ads-invariant
to pick a particular root,  = + or  = , and require that  behave as in (2.6) near
the boundary. (of course, we do not require that  obey the classical equations of motion
in the interior of ads space.) with this asymptotic condition, the action (2.5) is nite for
 > d/2. but the bound on  can be relaxed by adding appropriate boundary terms to
the action. by integrating by parts and discarding the boundary term, we can replace the
action by

the boundary term in this integration by parts is nonzero (and in fact divergent) if  
d/2, so in writing the action (2.7), we are modifying the denition of the action. the
modied action integral is convergent if

 >

d  2

2

.

(2.8)

this is precisely the unitarity bound on the dimension of a scalar operator in d dimensions,
so in particular we cannot expect by any further device to get even smaller s. in the
mass range (2.3), this condition allows  =  as well as +, while for larger m2 only
 = + is allowed.

though convergent for elds that obey the boundary conditions, the action (2.7) is
not manifestly positive denite. however, it is positive denite, because the operator
2 + m2 is positive denite for the range of m2 of interest, namely m2 > d2/4.

thus, as pointed out in [24], there are two dierent ads-invariant quantizations of the
scalar eld with m2 in the range (2.3). one lagrangian  in this case that of a scalar eld
of given m2  can give rise to two dierent quantum eld theories in ads space, depending
on the choice of boundary condition. according to the general ads/cft correspondence,
any quantum eld theory in ads space is equivalent to a conformal eld theory on the
boundary. the two dierent ads theories with a given m2 will correspond to two dierent
cfts, one with an operator of dimension + and the other with an operator of dimension
. 1 in many examples, one of the two theories is much more readily studied than the
other because one is supersymmetric and the other is not. but both exist in principle.

1 of course, treating the ads scalar eld as a free eld of mass m2 can never be precisely right,
since this eld always interacts at least with gravity. there will in general be mass renormalization,
in which case the dimensions of the operators will not be precisely + and .

5

2.2. correlation functions

our main remaining goal will be to dene the correlation functions from the ads/cft

correspondence for both choices of the theory. in the process we will also give an important

formula for the expectation values of operators. we will look for the denition of the

euclidean action which generates properly normalized correlation functions.

to compute correlation functions, one must relax the boundary condition (2.6), so we

have to exercise additional care in dening the action. indeed, there is a subtlety with the

normalization of the two-point function in the ads/cft correspondence. in [25], it was
shown that an extra factor of (2  d)/d, not coming in an obvious way from evaluating
the classical action, is needed for consistency with the ward identities. this factor was

then derived by imposing the boundary condition at z = , as advocated in [2,26,25], and
taking the   0 limit at the end of the calculation. we will present a dierent way of
obtaining this factor which involves adding an appropriate boundary term to the action.

in calculating correlation functions of vertex operators from the ads/cft correspon-

dence, the rst problem is to reconstruct an on-shell eld in adsd+1 from its boundary
behavior. if  is one of the roots of (2.1), then one requires that for small z

(z, ~x)  zd[0(~x) + o(z2)] + z[a(~x) + o(z2)] ,

(2.9)

where 0(~x) is a prescribed source function and a(~x) describes a physical uctuation
that will be determined from the source by solving the classical equations. in our discussion

so far, we only considered the physical uctuation a(~x).

we begin with the usual case  = +. in this case, the rst term in (2.9) domi-
nates over the second near z = 0, and the construction of (z, ~x) from 0(~x) is usually
accomplished with the help of the bulk-to-boundary propagator [3,25],

k(z, ~x, ~x) = d/2

()

(  (d/2))

z

(z2 + (~x  ~x)2) ,

so that

(z, ~x) =z ddxk(z, ~x, ~x)0(~x) .

the normalization in (2.10) is chosen so that (2.9) is satised. we note that

(2.10)

(2.11)

a(~x) = d/2

()

(  (d/2))z ddx0(~x)|~x  ~x|2 .

6

for extended sources this is a formal expression because it diverges for  > d/2, but it
will be useful after appropriate regularization is taken into account. we may also consider
a localized source, 0(~x) = d(~x  ~x). then

a(~x) = d/2

()

(  (d/2))|~x  ~x|2

(2.12)

and it was observed in [17] that, up to a normalization factor, this is the two-point function
ho(~x)o(~x)i. this suggests that a(~x) has the interpretation of the expectation value of
the operator o(~x) in the theory where another operator o is inserted at ~x. we will see
that the precise relation is

a(~x) =

1

2  dho(~x)i

up to normalization this is the same relation as the one advocated in [16,17,14,18,19]. the
precise factor is related to the normalization of the two-point function rst found in [25].
we will be able to show that this relation holds beyond the linearized approximation.

in order to dene the value of action on the solution (2.11), it is convenient to introduce

another eld, , through

(z, ~x) = zd(z, ~x) .

after integrating by parts and discarding an appropriate boundary term, the action as-
sumes the following form:

(2.13)

(2.14)

i =

1

2z ddxdz zd+12(cid:2)(z)2 + (i)2(cid:3) .

we propose to dene the two-point function for  = + using this action. it diers from
the original action (2.5) in that the leading small z divergence has been discarded. the
action integral in (2.14) is convergent if d/2 + 1 >  > d/2. for   d/2 + 1, a more
complicated subtraction of boundary divergences is needed to get a well-dened action.
this corresponds to the fact that the conformal eld theory generating functional that
we will compute has additional short distance singularities if   d/2 + 1. we will not
explicitly make the additional regularization of the action that is needed for  in this
range.

now we are ready to calculate the two-point function from the ads/cft correspon-
dence. we need to evaluate the improved action i in terms of 0(~x); that is, we need to
evaluate i for a classical solution (2.11) with given 0(~x). integrating (2.14) by parts we
nd

z .

(2.15)

i =  lim

z0

zd+12z dd~x

1
2

7

in evaluating this expression, the 0  0 terms vanish if  < d/2 + 1,2 and the a a terms
vanish if  > d/2. to be more precise, to evaluate (2.15), we can replace  by 0 and
z by (2  d)z2d1a(~x) for small z. (terms with a coming from  and 0 from z
vanish using the property emphasized in the last footnote.) so we nd that

i(0) = (  (d/2))d/2

()

(  (d/2))z dd~xz dd~x 0(~x)0(~x)
|~x  ~x|2 .

(2.16)

in particular, as expected,  is the dimension of the operator o that couples to the source
0 in the boundary conformal eld theory. because of the divergence for ~x near ~x (2.16)
has to be understood in an appropriately regularized sense. for example, the corresponding

expression in momentum space is

i(0) = 

1

2z

d4k
(2)4 0(k)0(k)f+(|k|) ,

where

(1 + )

is the fourier transform of the two-point function (we have dened  = pm2 + d2/4 =
+  d/2). (2.17) is nite for 0(k) that fall o suciently fast for large k. note that the
fourier transform of |~x|2+ is actually uv divergent and when appropriately dened has
the negative coecient that is indicated.

we will not attempt a similar derivation in detail for  > d/2 + 1. however, we claim

that in this range, after the additional subtractions of boundary terms that are needed to
make i nite, the 0  0 terms vanish and the 0  a terms can be evaluated to give the
same formula as (2.16).

the overall minus sign in (2.16) is crucial: since 0 is interpreted as the source coupling
to the cft operator o, this is the correct sign to insure the positivity of the two-point

function. indeed, exp(i) is interpreted in the boundary eld theory as hexp(r 0o)i. so

negativity of (2.16) is needed for positivity of the correlation function ho(~x)o(~x)i.

one-point function in presence of sources

the prefactor   (d/2) in (2.16) is also important: this is the factor advocated in
[25]. due to the presence of this factor, we see, on comparing (2.12) to (2.16), that the

2 to prove this, one uses the fact that the correction to the 0 term in a classical solution (2.9)

is of order z2.

relation ho(~x)i = (2 d)a(~x) holds to linear order in the sources. let us show that this
relation holds to all orders.

the diagrammatic relation between the term a(~x)z in the
asymptotic behavior of the eld in an arbitrary correlation func-
tion or physical process (left) and the same process with an extra
insertion of an operator o(~x) (right). the solid black dot repre-
sents on the left a point in ads near the boundary where a eld
is measured and on the right a point on the boundary at which an

operator is inserted. as the black dot approaches the boundary,
the two gures are related by the indicated factor.

the expectation value of o(~x) is given by the sum over diagrams where a bulk-to-
boundary propagator k(~x; z, ~x) connects the point ~x to the rest of the diagram with
source points located at the boundary. the classical eld (z, ~x) is given by summing the
same diagrams, except the bulk-to-boundary propagator is replaced by the bulk-to-bulk
propagator leading to the point (z, ~x). the normalized expression for the bulk-to-bulk
propagator is given, for instance, in [27]:

g(z, ~x; z, ~x) =

where f is the hypergeometric function, and u = [(z  z)2 + (~x  ~x)2]/2zz. we note
that, as z  0 away from the source points, (z, ~x)  za(~x). in this limit

(2u1)f (,

.

this property of the normalized greens functions, rst emphasized in [28], thus provides
a general explanation of the relation (2.13).

extension to  < d/2

the derivations presented so far apply to the theory with  = +. as we have
explained, for masses in the range (2.3) it should be possible to dene a dierent theory

where the operator corresponding to the scalar eld in ads5 has dimension . the 
theory is not independent from the + theory but is, in fact, related to it by a canonical
transformation that interchanges the roles of 0(~x) and a(~x). the fact that 0 and a
are conjugate variables is also suggested by the group-theoretic analysis in [29]. if from
the point of view of the + theory 0 is the source and (2  d)a is the eld,
then the opposite is true for the  theory. this strongly suggests that the generator of

connected correlators of the  theory is obtained by legendre transforming the generator

of connected correlators of the + theory. this type of relationship is familiar from the
liouville theory where it has been suggested that theories with two dierent branches of

gravitational dressing of a given operator are related by a legendre transform [30].

to see how this works for the two-point functions, it is convenient to use fourier space.
the quadratic part of the action is given in (2.17), where f+(|k|) is the fourier transform
of the two-point function in the + theory. the legendre transform is carried out by rst
setting

j(0, a) = i(0) + (2  d)z

d4k
(2)4 0(k)a(k).

we have included a factor of (2d) based on the idea that the conjugate of 0 is actually
(2  d)a. as we will see, this factor, though we have not justied it precisely, gives the
nicest normalization for the two point function of the transformed theory. the legendre
transformed functional i(a) is the minimum of j(0, a) with respect to 0 (for xed a),
and is explicitly

i(a) = 

d4k

which is related to f+(|k|) by   . fourier transforming back to position space (via
an integral which now converges, so that there is no additional ip of sign) and recalling

that the two-point function is minus the second derivative of the eective action, we nd
that in the  theory

happily, this function is indeed positive for all dimensions  above the unitarity bound.
note also that (2.20) is exactly the same formula as the one we would nd by extrapolating
(2.16) to (d  2)/2 <  < d/2.

one may be puzzled by the double zero of the two-point function at  = d/2. in
fact, value of , which corresponds to m2 = d2/4 is the special case where + = .
here the two possible small z behaviors of a classical solution are zd/2 ln(z/z0) and zd/2.
now, only one conformally-invariant boundary condition is possible. we can ask that
physical uctuations behave as zd/2 with no zd/2 ln(z/z0) term. but it does not make
sense to ask that they behave as zd/2 ln(z/z0) with no zd/2 term; such a condition would
depend on the choice of z0, violating conformal invariance. there is therefore likewise only
one natural way to incorporate an external source 0; we require that (z, ~x) approaches
0(~x)zd/2 ln(z/z0) for small z.3 the bulk eld as dened by (2.11), however, behaves for
 = d/2 as zd/20(~x). to remove this discrepancy we may simply divide the operator o
by   (d/2), in which case we should divide and multiply 0 and a by the same factor.
with this perhaps more useful normalization, the ads two-point function becomes

ho(~x)o(~x)i = 2d/2

which does not vanish until the dimension approaches the unitarity bound. this eld
renormalization has a similar eect on the three-point functions: the leg factors
((d/2))
((d/2)+1) so that the zeroes at
that appear in the results of [25] are changed into
 = d/2 are eliminated. this is in accord with the eld theory results which give non-
vanishing correlators of dimension d/2 operators, such as those found in the n = 4 sym
in general, one should keep in mind that the ads results agree with eld
theory [31].
theory calculations only after certain dimension dependent eld normalization factors are
included [31].

3 once such a source is included, the ln(z/z0) term gives a violation of conformal invariance in
dening the expectation value hoi. this is the correct answer from the point of view of conformal

eld theory. if o has dimension d/2, there is a logarithmic divergence in the two point function

r ddxei~p~xho(~x)o(0)i, as a result of which if one computes hoi in the presence of a source, there

is a logarithmic violation of conformal invariance.

11

to summarize the present section, in the range of scalar masses (2.3), there are two
possible theories. one of them associates to the scalar eld an operator of dimension +,
while the other associates an operator of dimension . the two dierent denitions of the
theory correspond to interchanging the source 0(~x) and the expectation value (2d)a(~x)
dened by the boundary behavior (2.9). thus, the generating functionals of correlation

functions are related by a legendre transform. this is analogous to the situation found

in liouville theory where the generating functional corresponding to the theory with one

branch of gravitational dressing is the legendre transform of the generating functional

corresponding to the other branch [30].

3. examples of symmetry breaking

in this section we discuss perhaps the simplest example of the ads/cft duality in

presence of symmetry breaking. this example was discussed previously in [1,14]: the

gauge symmetry present on coincident d3-branes in at space may be broken simply by

separating them into several parallel stacks. below we will discuss a simple case of breaking
su (n ) down to s(u (n1)u (n2)) by separating n coincident d3-branes into two parallel
stacks containing n1 and n2 coincident d3-branes. its generalizations to more complicated
breaking patterns will then be immediate.

the two-stack conguration of branes corresponds to higgsing of the n = 4 gauge

theory by scalar elds

~x =(cid:18) ~d1  i1

0

0

~d2  i2(cid:19)

(3.1)

where ~di is the position of the i-th brane stack and ii is the ni  ni identity matrix. such
a higgsing gives expectation values to the chiral elds o(n)
i1i2...in = tr xi1xi2 . . . xin 

trace terms:

ho(n)

i1i2...ini  n1[(d1)i1 (d1)i2 . . . (d1)in  traces] + n2[(d2)i1(d2)i2 . . . (d2)in  traces] . (3.2)

we wish to see how these order parameters emerge in the ads description.

to obtain that description, we must nd the appropriate analog of the ads5  s5
metric. for this, we proceed along lines described in the introduction. the greens function

with two separated sources is

h = l4  a1
|~y  ~d1|4
12

+

a2

|~y  ~d2|4! ,

(3.3)

where y1, . . . , y6 are the coordinates normal to the brane and

ai =

ni
n

.

(3.4)

it is always possible, by a shift of the coordinates, to choose the origin at the center of
mass so that a1 ~d1 + a2 ~d2 = 0. adopting this choice we nd that the greens function
(3.3) can be given the following taylor series expansion at large ~y (r = |~y|):

(3.5)

l4

r4  1 +

h =

with

2n (n + 1)d(n)

i1i2...in yi1yi2 . . . yin

r2n

xn=2

! ,

d(n)
i1i2...in = a1[(d1)i1 (d1)i2 . . . (d1)in  traces] + a2[(d2)i1 (d2)i2 . . . (d2)in  traces] .

(3.6)

the trace terms are precisely such that d(n)

i1i2...in is a traceless symmetric tensor.

given the greens function, the corresponding spacetime metric is, as in (1.2),

ds2 = h 1/2(dt2 + dx2

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

3) + h 1/2

dy2
j .

6xj=1

(3.7)

the large r behavior can be worked out using (3.5). in particular, if we simply set h =
l4/r4, we get the familiar ads5  s5 metric, with as usual r combining with t, x1, x2, x3
to make the ve ads5 coordinates. in this description, the boundary of ads5 is at r = ,
and r is related to the parameter z of section 2 by

r =

l2
z

.

(3.8)

expanding h 1/2 to linear order in ai we nd that for every n = 2, 3, . . ., there is in the
metric a correction term proportional to

d(n)
i1...in yi1 . . . yin

rn

.

(3.9)

where, in general, d(n)
greens function h.

i1...in are the tensors that appear in the partial wave expansion of the

as we have explained in eqn.

(2.13), the existence of a correction to the metric
proportional to rn = zn means that a conformal eld of dimension n has an expectation
value. given the structure of (3.9), this conformal eld clearly transforms under the
so(6) symmetry of the yi as d(n)
i1i2...in and, up

i1...in . the eld in question is precisely o(n)

13

to proportionality constants that we have not checked, the d(n)
with the expectation values (3.2) calculated in eld theory.

i1...in given in (3.6) agree
in fact, in the ads/cft
correspondence, o(n)
i1i2...in is mapped to conformal uctuations in the metrics of ads5 and
s5 (and a related uctuation in the four-form gauge potential); in the present context,
such a uctuation comes from the rn correction term in h.

in a more general multi-stack example, with

h = l4xi

ai

|~y  ~di|4

, xi

ai = 1,

(3.10)

we can always eliminate the spin one or dipole harmonic in the expansion of h by adding

a constant to ~y to transform to a center of mass frame with pi ai ~di = 0. the higher
harmonics cannot be so eliminated and obey no general restrictions, so in general we get
expectation values of the chiral elds o(n) for all n  2. the vanishing of o(1) means that
the classical supergravity solutions of this kind, modulo coordinate transformations, are in
natural correspondence with the vacua of an su (n ), rather than u (n ), gauge theory.

so far we have discussed the terms in the metric coming from expanding h 1/2 to
linear order in the charges ai. however, as pointed out in [14], starting with n = 4 the
coecients of rn terms in the metric also have corrections containing higher powers of
ai. since ai = ni/n the structure of these terms is suggestive of expectation values of
operators containing more than a single trace [14]. for example, for n = 4, in addition to
ho(4)i we also seem to nd 1
n ho(2)o(2)i. we postpone investigation of these extra terms
for the future.

orbifolds

orbifolds obtained by dividing the space r6 transverse to the threebranes by a nite
subgroup  of so(6) can be discussed in a very similar fashion. if all branes are at the
origin in r6, we get a theory whose infrared limit is described by ads5  s5/. for
example, in some much-studied cases with  = zn [12,13], the ads5  s5/ geometry is
dual to a gauge theory with gauge group s(u (n )n).

higgsing of these theories will be described in the ads/cft correspondence by re-
placing ads5s5/ by a solution that looks like that near the boundary but is dierent in
the interior. for instance, higgsing of the gauge theory to a diagonal su (n ) is described
in terms of branes by placing all branes at the same smooth point in r6/, away from all
orbifold singularities. the corresponding greens function is

h = l4

nxi=1

1

|~y  i~y0|4 ,

14

(3.11)

with generic ~y0 and with i the elements of . again, h can be expanded in spherical
harmonics. the leading term at long distances is h = nl4/r4, and gives back an ads5 
s5/ metric near the boundary; the corrections vanish as higher powers of r and correspond
to expectation values of chiral elds in the gauge theory. other symmetry-breaking vacua
are described, in the ads language, by taking h to have sources at xed points of some
of the elements of  or to have sources consisting of more than a single  orbit.

note that if the group  acts on r6 with no invariant vectors, then a dipole term,
of order 1/r5, is always absent in the expansion of h in spherical harmonics, as this term
is annihilated by the sum over i. even if there are invariants in the action of  on r6, the
dipole term can be eliminated by shifting to center of mass coordinates in the directions
on which  acts trivially. once this is done, there is no 1/r5 term in h, so we never get
an expectation value for a chiral eld of dimension 1. this is just as well, for in a unitary
quantum eld theory in four dimensions, a scalar eld of dimension 1 must be free and so
cannot be described by the dynamics in the bulk of ads space. such a eld can only enter

the ads/cft correspondence as a singleton eld supported at innity. all assertions
in this paragraph remain true if the conguration of sources in (3.11) is generalized to a
more general -invariant conguration.

global structure

to conclude this section, we will make a few remarks about the global structure of

the supergravity solutions that we have discussed.
we recall the form of the ads5  s5 solution:

ds2 =

l2
r2 dr2 +

r2
l2

4xi=1

dx2

i + l2d2
5.

(3.12)

here 5 is the metric on a round ve-sphere, and xi, i = 1, . . . , 4, are coordinates on the
four dimensions parallel to the threebranes.

roughly speaking, the boundary of ads5 is at r =  (or z = 0 in the notation
of section 2, the relation being z = l2/r). the boundary thus appears to be a copy of
r4, parametrized by the xi. however, this is not the whole story, because the coordinate
system used in (3.12) behaves badly at r = 0. in fact, r = 0 contributes one more point
to the boundary of ads5 (heuristically, because the coecient of dx2
i vanishes at r = 0,
r = 0 is just a single point on the boundary). when we add this point, the boundary of
ads5 is compactied from r4 to s4.

the compactness of s4 means that, as long as we only consider perturbations that
admit this same global structure at innity, we cannot encounter infrared divergences.

15

moreover, the symmetry breaking or higgsing phenomena that we have studied above
cannot occur if the boundary is s4. one way to explain this uses the positivity of the
scalar curvature r of s4. the scalar elds x of the n = 4 theory have a conformally
invariant quadratic term in the action,

z d4xg(cid:18)tr (dx)2 +

r
6

tr x 2(cid:19) ,

(3.13)

that is strictly positive denite and prevents x from acquiring an expectation value, as
long as one only considers perturbations that make sense when the boundary is s4. (in
particular, a constant x eld on r4 has a singularity at the point at innity if one tries
to compactify to s4.)

because of all these facts, the theory on s4 is completely stable under suciently
small perturbations, and there is in fact a well-dened procedure for computing its corre-
lation functions. if we want to study symmetry-breaking, we cannot achieve this degree of
safety; we have to allow perturbations that cannot be naturally interpreted on s4 and
for which the metric will, in fact, have dangerous and dicult to interpret regions. to see
how this works, we rewrite (3.12) in the form (3.7) with

this metric appears to be badly behaved near r = 0, but as we have discussed, this is
part of the one-point compactication that converts the boundary from r4 to s4. now,
however, consider one of the symmetry-breaking choices like

h =

l4
r4 .

h = l4  a1
|~y  ~d1|4

+

a2

|~y  ~d2|4! .

(3.14)

(3.15)

there are now two dangerous points, at ~y = ~d1, ~d2. either of these looks in this coordinate
system just like the r = 0 point in the case (3.14). with two singularities, it is not possible
to absorb them as part of the boundary, since there is no reasonable compactication
of r4 by adding two points. thus, for the symmetry-breaking vacua, we are committed
to thinking of the boundary as r4. this is just another manifestation of the fact that
positivity of (3.13) makes symmetry breaking impossible if the boundary is s4.

with the boundary, on which the dual four-dimensional eld theory is formulated,
being r4, it is possible to have various types of infrared instabilities if relevant perturba-
tions are added. in the ads description, this is related to the fact that the bad behavior
of the metric at the dangerous points ~y = ~d1, ~d2 may be unstable against small pertur-
bations. to compute correlation functions in these symmetry-breaking vacua, care will
be needed in specifying the desired behavior of perturbations near the bad points of the
metric; the crucial clue is presumably that when there is only one such bad point, we know
(via compactication of the boundary) how to treat it. in any event, we know from the
case of just one bad point that a singularity of this type signals ow in the infrared to
a non-trivial renormalization group xed point, the n = 4 yang-mills theory with gauge
groups determined by the coecients of the singularities in h.

16

4. threebranes on the conifold

in this section, we will consider symmetry breaking in a more complex example 

threebranes near the conifold singularity. we recall that the conifold can be described in
terms of complex variables wa, a = 1, . . . , 4 by the equation

w2

a = 0.

xa

(4.1)

alternatively, one can introduce a 2  2 matrix of complex variables mij , i, j = 1, 2, and
write

0 = det m = m11m22  m12m21.

(4.2)

the two descriptions are related by an obvious linear change of variables. we denote the
manifold described by either of these equations as y6; it is a cone over a ve-manifold x5,
also denoted as t 1,1. t 1,1 is a homogeneous space (su (2) su (2))/u (1), where the u (1)
is a diagonal subgroup of su (2)  su (2) [32].

the near horizon geometry of a system of n type iib threebranes at the conifold
singularity is ads5t 1,1. in [9], we considered a conformal eld theory that is dual to type
iib on that spacetime. in this conformal eld theory, the gauge group is su (n ) su (n )
and there are chiral superelds ai, bj, i, j = 1, 2, with ai transforming as (n, n) and
bj transforming as (n, n) under su (n )  su (n ). there is also a superpotential w =
ij kltraibkajbl.

in [9], we considered only the vacuum of the gauge theory with zero expectation value
for ai and bj, and only the ads5  t 1,1 solution on the string theory side. our intent
here is to consider more general vacua and solutions.

on the supergravity/string theory side, we can, to begin with, consider the following

three operations:

1) deformation of the singularity.

2) resolution of the singularity.

3) moving the branes away from the singularity.

we will want to interpret all of these operations  to the extent that they can occur

 in tems of higgsing of the gauge theory.

deformation of the singularity means merely that an additional term is added to the

equation describing the conifold. it becomes

w2

a = .

xa

17

(4.3)

resolution of the singularity is more subtle to describe.4 one solves the equation
(4.2) by introducing complex variables ai, bj, i, j = 1, 2, and writing mij = aibj. then one
imposes the constraint

|bj|2 = ,

(4.4)

xi

|ai|2 xj

with  a constant. if  = 0, then one gets a description of the conifold by imposing also

the equivalence relation

ai  eiai, bj  eibj,

(4.5)

to remove the redundancy in the solution mij = aibj. the resolution of the conifold is
described by taking  6= 0, and still imposing the equivalence relation.

ads5  t 1,1 is the same topologically as r4  r  t 1,1, where r  t 1,1 is the cone
y6 over t 1,1 with the singularity of the cone omitted. the usual metric on ads5  t 1,1 is

ds2 = h 1/2xi

dx2

i + h 1/2(cid:0)dr2 + r2d2(cid:1) ,

(4.6)

where h is the standard greens function h = l4/r4, d2 is the einstein metric (1.4)
on t 1,1, and pi dx2
i is the standard at metric on r4. in (4.6), dr2 + r2d2 should be
interpreted as a calabi-yau metric on r  t 1,1. in the spirit of the present paper, we
will incorporate symmetry breaking by replacing h by a more general greens function
to account for motion of the threebranes, and by replacing dr2 + r2d2 by a calabi-yau
metric on the deformation y 
6 . (these calabi-yau
metrics have been discussed in [15].) our goal will then be to match this more general
geometry to a symmetry breaking vacuum in the gauge theory.

6 of the conifold, or its resolution y 

the two operations of deforming and resolving the conifold are usually described in

string theory in terms of motion in complex structure or kahler moduli space.

in the

case of the conifold, these motions are mutually incompatible; one can do either one but

not both. (there can be under suitable conditions a phase transition between the two

branches [33].) in the present context, only the resolution of the conifold is generically
allowed, in the following sense. the manifold t 1,1 has second betti number 1, and as a
result, in string theory on ads5  t 1,1 there are rr and ns-ns b-elds. these combine
together into a complex parameter which is interpreted in terms of the gauge couplings
of the su (n )  su (n ) theory. on the other hand, the deformation y 
6 of the conifold is

4 the resolution of interest to us is a small resolution that preserves the calabi-yau con-
dition. if one did not wish to preserve the calabi-yau condition, many more general resolutions

would be possible.

18

topologically t s3 (the cotangent bundle of the three-sphere) and in particular its second
betti number vanishes. hence, in string theory on r4  y 
6 , any at b-eld can be gauged
away. if there are nonzero theta angles at innity (that is, on r4  t 1,1  we recall that
6 looks like t 1,1 at innity)  then there must be non-zero curvatures h = db in the
y 
interior of y 
6 . non-zero values of the h-elds break supersymmetry, so one would not
get supersymmetric vacua in this way. moreover, the nonzero h would provide a source
for the dilaton, so the elds with non-trivial b-elds at innity may not give r4  y 
6
solutions at all. we conclude, then, that the deformation of the conifold is possible (or at
least, accessible) only if the b-elds vanish at innity, and thus only for special values of
the gauge couplings of the dual conformal eld theory. a phenomenon that can occur only
for special values of the gauge couplings is beyond our present understanding of the gauge
theory, and thus we will not attempt to further analyze the deformation of the conifold
in the present paper. furthermore, this particular case may turn out to be the hardest
to analyze because for b = 0 one of the two su (n ) gauge couplings is expected to blow
up [11]. this is natural from the point of view of owing to the conifold eld theory from
an orbifold eld theory. also, in the t-dual description in terms of the ns5-branes
and d4-branes, this is the point in the moduli space where the distance between the two
ns5-branes vanishes [34], presumably giving rise to tensionless strings. so the locus for
which deformation of the conifold is possible is probably quite subtle to describe.

on the other hand, the resolution y 

6 is topologically an r4 bundle over s2; its second
betti number is 1. thus, the at b-elds on t 1,1 extend over y 
6 , and hence should make
sense for generic values of the gauge couplings. consequently, in the rest of this section we
concentrate on matching the resolution of the conifold and the motion of the branes with
phenomena in the gauge theory.

4.1. first look at the gauge theory

for simplicity, we will look at vacua in which su (n ) su (n ) is broken to a diagonal
su (n ). once these vacua are understood, the extension to more general cases is apparent.
to have an unbroken diagonal su (n ), the n  n matrices ai and bj of chiral
superelds must be (perhaps after a gauge transformation) multiples of the identity. so
to get vacua of this type, we set ai = ai, bj = bj, with complex numbers ai and bj.
the order parameters mij = htr aibji/n are thus equal to aibj. as we have already
mentioned, equation (4.2) is an immediate consequence of mij = aibj. on the other hand,

there is no restriction in the gauge theory on the value of  =pi |ai|2pj |bj|2. the gauge

theory has both vacua with  = 0 and vacua with  6= 0. we interpret this to mean that
the dynamics of the gauge theory includes a description of the resolution of the conifold.

19

the gauge theory also lacks the equivalence relation (4.5). we interpret this to mean that
a pseudoscalar mode in r4  y 
6 that is related by supersymmetry to the resolution of the
conifold is likewise described by the gauge theory dynamics. the mode in question can be

described as follows: it is a mode of the four-form potential that transforms as a two-form
on r4 times a two-form on y 

6 . we recall that a two-form on r4 is dual to a scalar.

in short, we propose that the resolution (but of course, not the deformation) of the
conifold is described by the dynamics of the dual su (n )su (n ) gauge theory. according
to this proposal, the resolution of the conifold is described by the choice of vacuum in a

xed gauge theory with xed coupling constants, rather than by a change in the coupling

constants of the theory.

here is a bit of topological evidence for this proposal. the su (n )  su (n ) gauge
theory with the chiral superelds ai, bj, has a baryon number global symmetry ai 
eiai, bj  eibj. this symmetry might be called baryon number because typical
order parameters are the baryonic, or dibaryonic, operators det ai and det bj. according
to [35], the baryon number is mapped in the dual ads5  t 1,1 description to the wrapping
number of threebranes on a three-cycle in t 1,1. such a wrapping number exists because
the third betti number of t 1,1 is 1. (topologically t 1,1 is s3  s2 [15].) now, when we
replace ads5  t 1,1 by r4  y 
6 , this conserved threebrane wrapping number no longer
exists, because the third betti number of y 
6 is zero. (a wrapped threebrane at innity in
r4  y 
6 must correspond in
the su (n ) su (n ) gauge theory to vacua in which the baryonic charge is not conserved.
indeed, in vacua with  6= 0, the ai and bj cannot all vanish, and hence the expectation
values of operators det ai and det bj carrying baryon number are likewise not all zero.

6 can move into the interior and annihilate.) thus, r4  y 

at the cost of jumping slightly ahead of our story, we can also consider the case that
the gauge symmetry is broken, with mij 6= 0, but  = 0 and the conifold singularity is not
resolved. also in this case, some of the baryonic order parameters det ai and det bj of
the eld theory are nonzero, so baryon number should not be conserved. on the ads side,
we will interpret these vacua in terms of string theory on r4  y6, with a greens function
h whose singularity is not at the conical singularity of y6. it follows that in this case,
the conifold singularity is at a nite distance in spacetime, and a wrapped threebrane can

presumably disappear by collapsing to the conifold singularity. this contrasts with the
ads5  t 1,1 spacetime, which is dual to a vacuum with unbroken symmetries; here the
conifold singularity has disappeared to innity in spacetime, and there is no way for a

wrapped threebrane to annihilate.

20

4.2. quantitative treatment

we now wish to describe these vacua somewhat more quantitatively. the rst step is
6 . then one nds the appropriate
6 , with sources at the desired positions of the threebranes,

to nd the appropriate calabi-yau metric ds2
greens function h on y6 or y 
and the spacetime metric takes the familiar form:

6 on y6 or y 

ds2 = h 1/2xi

dx2

i + h 1/2ds2
6.

(4.7)

a=1 w2

a = 0, set

this program can be described most explicitly for the case of y6  moving the three-
branes away from the conifold singularity without resolving it  because the calabi-yau
metric on y6 is particularly elementary. in terms of the description of the conifold via an

equationp4
then the ads5 radial coordinate is r =p3/22/3. the y6 metric has the familiar conical

cone = dr2 + r2ds2

where e is the angular laplacian on t 1,1.

because t 1,1 is a homogeneous space, the spectrum of the angular laplacian can be
worked out via group theory [36,37]. t 1,1 has symmetry group su (2)su (2)u (1), where
the wa transform as (1/2, 1/2) under su (2) su (2) and with charge 1 under u (1). (the
u (1) is an r-symmetry group.) the spherical harmonics that are relevant for studying

expectation values of chiral superelds are the modes that transform as (k/2, k/2) with
u (1) charge k. the corresponding wavefunctions are simply

form ds2
source is

wa1 wa2 . . . wak

|pb wbwb|k/2 ,

(4.10)

or the complex conjugate of this to reverse the sign of the u (1) charge. (the reason that

these are the relevant modes is roughly that modes with both ws and ws in the numerator

would have a larger eigenvalue of the laplacian for given u (1) charge and would ultimately

lead to nonchiral operators.) the eigenvalue of the laplacian for these modes is [36,37]

e(k) = 3(cid:18)k(k + 2)

(4.11)

(4.9) implies

if we look for a contribution to h of the form rc(k)bwa1a2...ak , we nd that the equation

c(k)(c(k) + 4) = e(k).

(4.12)

we want the negative root, since we want h to behave as r4 at innity. so

with the given values of e(k), this gives the attractively simple result

c(k) = 2 pe(k) + 4.

given this, it follows that the relevant terms in h take the form

c(k) = 4  3k/2.

(4.14)

(4.15)

for some f s.

the series of correction terms to h of relative order r3k/2 give corrections to the
ads5  t 1,1 metric that vanish like r3k/2 or z3k/2 near the boundary. according to
eqn. (2.13), such corrections imply that an operator of dimension 3k/2 has an expectation
value. for the harmonics described above, the u (1) or r-charge is k. a eld of r-charge
k and dimension 3k/2 is a chiral supereld. in this case, the chiral superelds in question
transform like (k/2, k/2) under su (2)  su (2). these are the quantum numbers of the
chiral superelds discussed in [9], namely tr ai1bj1 ai2 bj2 . . . aik bjk + permutations of
indices i1, . . . , ik and j1, . . . , jk.

notice that for k = 1, we have here an expectation value of an operator of dimension
3/2, which is above the unitarity bound (which is 1 in d = 4 dimensions), but below the
naive ads bound of d/2 = 2. the formalism for studying in ads space a scalar operator of
dimension in this range was discussed in section 2. for our present purposes, the net eect
is simply that the term of relative order r3k/2 in the metric is due to the expectation
value of a dimension 3k/2 operator both for k = 1 and for k > 1.

so far, we have made no assumption about the nature of the source terms for h: we
have merely assumed that near r = , h obeys the laplace equation and vanishes as r4.
we can, if we wish, require further that all threebranes are located at a point wa = a on
y6 away from the conifold singularity. in this case, h will be invariant under the subgroup
of su (2)  su (2)  u (1) that leaves xed the point wa = a. this implies that fa1a2...ak
a = 0, and
f is subject to no other restriction. translated into the language of the gauge theory,

in (4.15) is a multiple of a1 a2 . . . ak . in particular, for k = 1, we have pa f 2

22

this amounts to the statement that for a vacuum with an unbroken diagonal su (n ), the
order parameters mij = htr aibji are coordinates of a point on y6. this is the familiar
statement that the equation (4.2) of the conifold is a consequence of mij = aibj. moreover,
as explained in [9], for these higgsed vacua with unbroken diagonal su (n ), the low energy
theory has n = 4 supersymmetry (even though the microscopic theory has n = 1). this
is the result expected on the gravitational side, since with a 6= 0 the metric singularity is
that of n threebranes at a smooth point.

one can make a similar comparison between gauge theory and gravity for the expec-
tation values of chiral superelds with k > 1. for single trace operators, which correspond
to linear terms in the expansion of h 1/2, these additional comparisons, to the extent that
they can be made without further detailed computations, yield little that is really new
since the results are nearly determined by the symmetries. both the expectation values
of the chiral elds and the coecients in the expansion of h are determined, up to a
k-dependent normalization constant that depends on quantities we have not computed
(such as the precise constants in (4.15) if h has only a single delta function source term
at wi = i), by the unbroken symmetries. however, similarly to the example of section 3,
for k > 1 one nds that the coecient of the r3k/2 term in the metric is corrected by
non-linear terms in the expansion of h 1/2. their structure once again seems to correspond
to multiple-trace operators in the gauge theory, and the meaning of this requires further
investigation.

the resolution

threebranes on the resolved manifold y 

ference being that the calabi-yau metric of y 
6
description of the greens function h will be correspondingly less explicit.

6 can be described similarly, the main dif-
is known less explicitly [15], and the

the resolution of the conifold can be interpreted, in gauge theory language, in terms
of giving an expectation value to a certain operator u. let us compute the dimension of
this operator. under scalings of r, the conical metric dr2 + r2d2 on y6 scales, obviously,
like r2, as therefore does the kahler form  on y6. the resolution of y6 is obtained by a
motion in kahler moduli space, and so by a topologically non-trivial correction to . this
topologically nontrivial correction is indeed

abcdwawbdwcdwd

 =

|pa wawa|2

.

(4.16)

(the sign with which  is added to the kahler form determines which of two topologically
distinct resolutions of y6 is obtained.) to verify that this is the correct , we proceed as
follows.  is invariant under the so(4) symmetry of y6 but not under the disconnected

23

component of o(4). in fact, the disconnected component of o(4) exchanges the ai and bj
in (4.4), and hence changes the sign of  and therefore of . direct computation shows
that d = 0 (this xes the power of |ww| in the denominator of (4.16) and hence the
scaling weight of ). however,  is not of the form d for any . (indeed, by averaging
over the compact group so(4), one could always assume that  is so(4)-invariant; but
on y6 every so(4)-invariant one-form is also o(4)-invariant.)

from (4.16), we see that  is invariant under scalings of w or equivalently of r, so
it scales like r2 relative to the unperturbed kahler form  on the cone. this scaling
corresponds to the expectation value of an operator of dimension two in the gauge theory.
the term of order r2 is the leading large r correction in the c-y metric on y 
6 : the
einstein equations force the topologically trivial corrections to  to vanish faster than r2
for large r. there are also additional corrections to the metric of ads5  t 1,1 coming from
the greens function h, similar to the ones that were present in the symmetry-breaking
vacua on y6; these terms correspond to expectation values of the chiral operators tr(ab)k.
let us try to interpret the correction term of order r2 in the gauge theory. comparing
again to (4.4), the natural gauge theory order parameter for the resolution, in terms of
the chiral superelds ai and bj, is u = tr aiai  tr bjbj. we note that classically u
has dimension two, in agreement with the dimension that we found from the asymptotic
correction to the kahler metric on y 
6 . the operator u is contained in the same multiplet
with the current that generates the baryon number symmetry ai  eiai, bj  eibj.
the conserved current has no anomalous dimension, so likewise the dimension of u is
uncorrected in going from the classical description to supergravity.

conserved current multiplets are among the several possible shortened multiplets of
su (2, 2|1) [38,37]. as explained above, the operator u belongs to a conserved current
multiplet and it is interesting to ask what is the supergravity multiplet related to it through

the ads/cft correspondence. the multiplets appearing in type iib supergravity on
ads5  t 1,1 were recently classied in [37], and we will make use of this analysis. we
expect the baryon number current of the gauge theory to correspond to the massless
gauge eld in ads5 which couples to the d3-brane wrapped over the 3-cycle in t 1,1.
this eld is the component of the 4-form with one ads5 index and three t 1,1 indices,
aabc. vector multiplet i listed in table 7 of [37] contains precisely this kind of vector
eld. when the internal laplacian eigenvalue is e = 0, corresponding to a singlet under
su (2) su (2) u (1)r, then this vector eld is massless. in this case the vector multiplet
in table 7 also contains a scalar in ads5 with m2 = 4 corresponding to dimension  = 2,
and we identify this eld with the scalar operator u. this eld is a graviton with two t 1,1
indices [37], as expected from the preceding discussion. to summarize, the operator u

24

and the baryon number current are related through the ads/cft duality to elds from a
massless ads5 vector multiplet.

appendix a. chiral primary operators

here we discuss the supergravity modes which correspond to chiral primary operators.
(for an extensive analysis of the spectrum of the model that appeared following the original
version of the present paper, see [37].) this will give further background for the discussion
in sections 3 and 4. for the ads5  s5 case, these modes are mixtures of the conformal
factors of the ads5 and s5 and the 4-form eld. the same has been shown to be true for
the t 1,1 case [36,39,37]. in fact, we may keep the discussion of such modes quite general
and consider ads5  x5 where x5 is any einstein manifold.

the diagonalization of such modes carried out by kim, romans and van nieuwen-
huizen for the s5 case [40] is easily generalized to any x5. the mixing of the conformal
factor and 4-form modes results in the following mass-squared matrix,

m2 =(cid:18) e + 32 8e
e (cid:19)

4/5

where e  0 is the eigenvalue of the laplacian on x5. the eigenvalues of this matrix are
(a.1)

m2 = 16 + e  84 + e .

we will be primarily interested in the modes which correspond to picking the minus branch:
they turn out to be the chiral primary elds. for such modes there is a possibility of m2
falling in the range (2.3) where there is a two-fold ambiguity in dening the corresponding
operator dimension. this happens for the eigenvalue e such that

5  e  21 .

(a.2)

first, let us recall the s5 case where the spherical harmonics correspond to traceless
symmetric tensors of so(6), d(k)
i1...ik . here e = k(k + 4), and it seems that the bound (a.2)
is satised for k = 1. however, this is precisely the special case where the corresponding
mode is missing. for k = 0 there is no 4-form mode, hence no mixing, while for k = 1 one of
the mixtures is the singleton [40]. thus, all chiral primary operators in the n = 4 su (n )
theory correspond to the conventional branch of dimension, +. it is now well-known that
this family of operators with dimensions  = k, k = 2, 3, . . . is d(k)
i1...ik tr(x i1 . . . x ik ). the
absence of k = 1 is related to the gauge group being su (n ) rather than u (n ). thus, in
this case we do not encounter operator dimensions lower than 2.

25

the situation is dierent for t 1,1. here there is a family of wave functions labeled by
non-negative integer k, transforming under su (2)  su (2) as (k/2, k/2), and with u (1)
charge k. they are described in section 4.2, and the eigenvalues of the laplacian are
written in (4.11). in [9] it was argued that the corresponding chiral operators are

tr(ai1bj1 . . . aik bjk ) .

since the f-term constraints in the gauge theory require that the i and the j indices are
separately symmetrized, we nd that their su (2) su (2) u (1) quantum numbers agree
with those given by the supergravity analysis. since in the eld theory construction of [9]
the as and the bs have dimension 3/4, the dimensions of the chiral operators are 3k/2.

in studying the dimensions from the supergravity point of view, one encounters a
subtlety discussed in section 2. while for k > 1 only the dimension + is admissible,
for k = 1 one could pick either branch. indeed, from (4.11) we have e(1) = 33/4 which
falls within the range (a.2). here we nd that  = 3/2, while + = 5/2. since the
supersymmetry requires the corresponding dimension to be 3/2, in this case we have to
pick the unconventional  branch. choosing this branch for k = 1 and + for k > 1
we indeed nd following [36] that the supergravity analysis based on (2.2), (a.1), (4.11),

reproduces the dimensions 3k/2. thus, the conifold theory provides a simple example of
the ads/cft duality where the  branch has to be chosen for certain operators.

let us also note that substituting e(1) = 33/4 into (a.1) we nd m2 = 15/4 which
in fact, the supermultiplet

corresponds to a conformally coupled scalar in ads5 [40].
containing this scalar has to include another conformally coupled scalar and a massless
fermion. one of these scalar elds corresponds to the lower component of the supereld
tr(aibj), which has dimension 3/2, while the other corresponds to the upper component
which has dimension 5/2. thus, the supersymmetry requires that we pick dimension +
for one of the conformally coupled scalars, and  for the other.
