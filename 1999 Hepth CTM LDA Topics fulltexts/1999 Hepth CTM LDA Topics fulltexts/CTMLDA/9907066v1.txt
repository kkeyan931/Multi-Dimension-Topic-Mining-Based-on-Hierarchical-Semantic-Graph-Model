in the light of recent studies of bps triple junctions in the wess-zumino model we describe tech-
niques to construct innite lattices using similar junctions.
it is shown that whilst these states
are only approximately locally bps they are nevertheless stable to small perturbations, giving a
metastable tiling of the plane.

i. introduction

domain walls have found their way into many areas
of physics, ranging from the small scale in solid state
laboratories, where they can appear as crystal disloca-
tions, to the large scales of cosmology. such objects can
come about when there are vacuum states which are dis-
connected yet degenerate in energy, although one can
envision walls appearing when the distinct vacua have
dierent energy, but then the walls are not static.

the case of interest here is supersymmetric eld theory,
where the distinct vacua come about from a polynomial
superpotential. as we shall see one is able to construct
states where two or more walls meet at a junction to cre-
ate a state which saturates a bogomolnyi bound. these
junctions have been investigated recently in the context
of the wess-zumino model by two groups [1] [2], point-
ing out that these junctions preserve 1
4 of the n = 1 su-
percharges. one may also motivate this study from the
viewpoint of supersymmetric qcd. there it is found that
gluino condensates can form, leading to the eective de-
grees of freedom satisfying a wess-zumino model [3]. in
this case distinct vacua are present, giving domain walls
which are bps states [4].

an intriguing possibility then arises due to the exis-
tence of junctions-one may make a network of domain
walls in a similar manner to string networks [5]. here
however we shall see that these networks of domain walls
are only locally approximately bps states rather than
full bps states.
in doing this we shall come across a
wonderful variety of patterns, including some of the eu-
clidean tilings [6].

although a connection is not clear, such arrangements
are familiar in uid mechanics [7] and the physics of gran-
ular layers [8]. in these faraday experiments the uids
are driven by an external force which can generate insta-
bilities, such as convection instabilities. a consequence
of this is the generation of diverse cell patterns, from
regular to quasi-patterns.

ii. general considerations.

we shall follow the approach of gibbons and townsend
in our choice of model [1], specically the model under

investigation is the bosonic sector of the wess-zumino
model, reduced to 2+1 dimensions. much of this section
can be found in their work but is reproduced here for
completeness. the lagrangian is dened by,

l =

4

   |w ()|2.

(1)

for static congurations we may use the energy density
to derive a bogomolnyi equation. this is facilitated by
the introduction of the complex coordinate z = x + iy,
whereupon the energy density becomes,

j(z, z).

h = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)



z  eiw (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

here we have introduced an arbitrary phase , and
j(z, z) is dened by,

j(z, z) = (cid:18) 

 z

 
z 


z

 
 z(cid:19) .

(3)

we may derive a bogomolnyi bound by dening the
quantities,

q =

2 z dxdy j (z, z),

t = 2z dxdy

w
z

,

leading to

e = z dxdy h  q + |t| ,

(4)

(5)

(6)

which is saturated by solutions of the rst order equation,


z

= eiw  .

(7)

we now focus on models where the scalar eld potential
energy density, |w ()|2, contains isolated, degenerate
minima. this allows for the presence of domain walls,
in particular if there are more than two minima there
will be more than one type of domain wall, giving the
possibility of a wall junction. the question of what type
of walls exist was investigated in [9], showing that not all
4d eld theories with more than two disconnected vacua

admit junction solutions, in contradiction to a statement
made in [2].

junctions may be thought of as the meeting point of
a number of domain walls. each domain wall interpo-
lates between two vacua and one may associate a complex
topological charge to them [9],

tab = 2eiarg(w (b)w (a))|w (b)  w (a)|,

(8)
with bps walls having a tension, ab = |tab|. this for-
mula for the tensions will be of great use later, as the wall
tensions are needed to describe the form of the junctions.

iii. the model.

to be specic we now choose a superpotential which
leads to three distinct vacua, placed where  is a cube
root of unity, (1, , 2),

w () =  

4.

in this case the tensions are all equal, leading to a triple
junction with 120 separating the sectors. one possible
lattice using these junctions consists of hexagonal do-
mains, pictured in fig. 1.

the dual lattice (the dotted triangles in fig. 1), then
gluing the plaquettes together. this would clearly lead
to a network of bps junctions. however we note that
each junction has a winding associated to it and that the
three junctions it connects to have the opposite winding,
with  being proportional to z or z (z here is measured
from the centre of the junction.) we see then that while
one junction may satisfy (7) its three neighbours satisfy
an anti-bps relation,


 z

= eiw  .

(10)

a bps junction would therefore be connected to three
anti-bps junctions, so no global coordinate system exists
that could make the whole lattice bps. we also note that
such a construction would lead to discontinuities in the
derivatives of  where the dual plaquettes meet because
one is solving dierent equations in each of them.

to establish whether a network could exist we per-
formed a numerical simulation of the second order la-
grange equations and searched for a hexagonal structure,
using a lattice with periodic boundary conditions. once a
tiling had been found we tested its stability by randomly
perturbing the eld, with the expected result; stable lat-
tices exist so long as the domain sizes are greater than
the width of the walls. an example is given below in fig.
2.

one may ask the question whether such a network
could be a bps state, that this is not the case may be seen
from two perspectives. firstly we note that the lattice
can at best be perturbatively stable, meaning it is not
the lowest energy state for the given boundary data, and
so is not bps. if one of the domains were to tunnel to a
dierent vacuum, liberating an energy of approximately
3l, the network would not recover its original form; the
newly tunnelled phase would propagate through the en-
tire lattice. secondly, one may try to create such a net-
work by solving the bps equations in the plaquettes of

tions. the arrows represent the complex eld  withe their
size and direction corresponding to the magnitude and phase
respectively.

an interesting property of the domain walls in this
model is that the wall interpolating between two vacua
is eected by the other vacua, making the the eld trace
out a curve in  space which is not straight. an even
more remarkable property of the bps domain walls is
that these curves are straight when plotted in the super-
potential, w, plane. to see this consider a domain wall
which is independent of y, so that z  x in (7). then

where  is now found to be the argument of the topologi-
cal charge on the wall [9]. this shows that the imaginary
component of eiw () is a constant, leading to bps do-
main walls tracing out straight lines in the w plane. this
is illustrated below in fig. 3, where the hexagonal array
of fig. 2 has been mapped to the  and w planes. the
density of dots in this gure represents the volume of
physical space occupying that region of eld space, the
cusps (vacua) are the most dense, as we would expect for
most of the eld being in a vacuum. the straight lines

using what we have learned above we may now be
more adventurous in the choice of superpotential. using
the quintic superpotential, w () =   1
5 5, we nd that
the vacua for  are the fourth roots of unity. in this case
there are six domain walls, four of which have tension
2, using (8). the junctions allowed
2 4
5 and two with 2 4
are found by considering the ways that the vacua can be
joined by domain walls. here there are essentially only
two types of junction, one three-junction and one four-
junction, with the angles involved being found by draw-
ing the vacuum connectivity in the w space. we know
that the tensions of the walls are proportional to the
length of the connection in w space between the vacua
(8), in fact these connections may be used as a vector
diagram for forces. together the domain walls making
up a junction form a closed polygon when mapped to the
w plane, this is precisely what is required of a vector
diagram of tensions if there is to be no net force. as
an example we consider the junctions of the quintic su-
perpotential in g. 4. a triple junction is calculated by
connecting up three vacua in the w plane and translat-
ing this into a closed vector diagram. these vectors then
make up the tensions in the junction, allowing the angles
to found trivially.

perpotential, a, b, c and d are the locations of the vacua.

one may initially expect the four-junction to be unsta-
ble to producing two triple junctions. this is not the case
as it would require a heavy wall to interpolate between
them which is disfavoured energetically. we undertook a
simulation of this potential, looking for regular tessella-
tions, testing the stability as before. one pattern which
can be formed uses only the triple junction, leading to
a familiar bathroom tiling consisting of octagons and
squares [6]. this can be made more intricate by includ-
ing the four-junction, a result pictured in fig. 5.

we end this catalogue by considering an order seven
superpotential, w () =   1
7 7. this has the possibil-
ity of a rich variety of patterns as there are 5 factorial
domain walls connecting the vacua, which are the sixth
roots of unity. the walls have three dierent tensions, oc-
curing in in the ratio 2:3:1. the triple vertex which has
all its walls at a dierent tension forms a junction with

separate the vacua. for metastability we require that
each domain does not know that there is another do-
main nearby in the same vacuum. this necessitates that
the domain sizes are larger than the width of the walls
separating them. one possible area for future study is
static, space lling domain wall networks in three spatial
dimensions. at present we see no reason why such states
could not exist, although they may occur more naturally
for a two component complex scalar transforming under
a natural su(2) action.

the networks of domain walls have been shown not to
be bps states, nevertheless junctions do locally approxi-
mately satisfy the bps (or anti-bps) equation, with the
violation getting smaller as the domain size increases.

the aforementioned method. one may use this this to
generate a tiling consisting of dodecagons, hexagons and

iv. conclusions

in this paper we have indicated the huge variety of
metastable networks that are possible in a relatively sim-
ple eld theory. these networks consist of domains,
where the eld falls into a given vacuum, and walls which
