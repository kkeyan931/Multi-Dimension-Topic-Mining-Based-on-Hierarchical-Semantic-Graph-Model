(13) below, measure  omitted always restored usual way. ghosts needed commuting gauge. shown appendix master equation always admits gauge form (11) least locally. apart that, always mystery, makes gauge distinguished attempts generalization didnt go through. answers come quantizing master equation. procedure example quantization gauge theory nilpotent generators. 3 quantizing master equation quantizing master equation shall build master equation master equation. taking s() original action gauge eld a, shall introduce antield look action m(, ) (14) would s() classical limit would also satisfy master equation proper solution: rm lm = 0 rank 2m = 4n 2 . 4 (15) (16) key point one needs ghosts building solution m. see this, recall ghosts needed . needed including gauge generators hessian action but, present case, gauge generators original s() already contained hessian, eq. (7). therefore, possible satisfy conditions without introducing new elds. indeed, solution m: m(, ) = s(a + ab b) + s(a ab b) . (17) easy check that, expression, eq. (15) satised virtue original master equation (4), rank condition (16) satised arguments two (17) independent. remains inserted (17) overall 1/2 satisfy condition classical limit precisely done. another key point classical limit kept doubled (see below). terms original elds antields, eq. (3), solution obtained form m(, ) = s( + , ) + s( , + ) , = , , = , (18) (19) new antield original eld , new antield original antield . antield antield has, course, statistics eld. remaining procedure standard. introduction gauge conditions one needs ghosts auxiliary sector . one extends m(, ) usual way: m(, ) + c = mtot(, , c ; , , c ) (20) bar c needed hold conventional terminology  since ghost c ; c . then, construction , following functional integral: z 2(j) = z ddd cdd c exp i(cid:16)mtot + 2aja(cid:17) (cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:16) c c(cid:17)(cid:16) (cid:17) (21) 5 depend choice = (, , c) . (22) misprint that, (21), z(j) appears squared, source term aja doubled. z(j) correct generating functional master equation. indeed, one decomposes original i, , chooses (, , c) = c 1( + c) + 1 2 2( c) 1 2 arbitrary functions 1, 2 , upon redesignations + ab b = 1 , ab b = 2 (23) (24) (25) one obtains z 2(j) = z d1d2 exp i(cid:16)s(1) + s(2) + 1ja + 2ja(cid:17) (cid:16)com(1)(cid:17)(cid:16)com(2)(cid:17) . (26) precisely square functional integral (13) commuting gauge! 4 master equation general gauge setting (22) (, , c) = c ii() (27) arbitrary i() one obtains generating functional z(j) general gauge: z 2(j) = z dd c exp i(cid:18)s(cid:16)a+ab c ri b (cid:17)+s(cid:16)a ab c ri b (cid:17)+2aja(cid:19) (cid:16)()(cid:17) . (28) general gauge, z(j) cannot written functional integral. one write product two coupled functional integrals take square root. mystery commuting gauge fact that, gauge, functional integrals decouple. explanation fact that, commuting gauge, ghosts ghosts make another copy original eld. two copies decouple, copy remains without ghosts. 6 expanding c (28), one z 2(j) = z dd c exp i(cid:18)2s() + 2aja c k rk e ea lrs ab bd ri c i(1)ib + o( c 4)(cid:19) (cid:16)()(cid:17) (29) obvious sign factor. seen that, owing doubling (17) source term, classical limit obtains correctly also, one-loop level, ghost contribution doubles contribution gauge eld. indeed, statistics ghosts c opposite statistics redundant variables (say, antields) is, therefore, statistics independent variables (elds). moreover, instead usual cc quadratic term, one c c. ghost determinant will, therefore, appear power 1/2. finally, inverse ghost propagator contains hessian original gauge action basic consequence nilpotency gauge generators. are, course, also higher-order ghost couplings. summarize, master equation possesses baron munchhausens gift lifting hair. master equation (for master equation) commuting gauge yields master equation general gauge. hence notation munchhausen master solution. acknowledgments work product research program quantization, generalized brs co- homology, anomalies organized erwin schrodinger international institute mathematical physics autumn 1998. author grateful erwin schrodinger institute technical university vienna hospitality support. special thanks anton rebhan organizational eorts, physics discussions, enjoyable company vienna. black hole, author supported part russian foundation fundamental research grant 99-02-18107 intas grant 93-493-ext. 7 appendix. existence commuting gauge master equation always admits commuting gauge least neighbourhood stationary orbit. proof follows. introduce matrix inverse (5): abbc = c denote sab = basic property sab nilpotency, eq.
