abstract

the existence of a ground ring of ghost number zero operators in the
chiral brst cohomology of the n =2 string is used to derive an innite set
of ward identities for the closed-string scattering amplitudes at arbitrary
genus. these identities are sucient to rederive the well known vanishing
theorem for loop amplitudes with more than three external legs.

1 introduction

the explicit computation of loop amplitudes in string theory is notoriously
dicult. even for the technically most simple theory  the bosonic string 
the level of mathematical complexity is impressing if one tries to go beyond one
loop. adding fermions and supersymmetry on the world-sheet does not improve
the situation. on the contrary, the calculations become still more intricate and
only a few explicit results exist. it seems that even the general formalism has
not yet been fully worked out [1].

fortunately, explicit computations can sometimes be replaced by more in-
direct methods, often related to symmetry arguments. it is thus not surprising
that for the n =2 string (i.e.
the theory based on extended supersymmetry
on the world-sheet; see [2] for a general review and [3] for a discussion of loop
amplitudes) berkovits and vafa succeeded to avoid the evaluation of the path
integral and obtained powerful results for loop amplitudes by embedding the
theory into an n =4 topological theory [4].
in fact, they found that all am-
plitudes with more than three external legs vanish to all orders in the loop
expansion. the purpose of this letter is to give an alternative derivation of this
result. our approach has the advantage that conceptually it is very clear what
is going on since the equations used to derive the vanishing of the amplitudes
can nicely be interpreted as ward identities of an innite set of unbroken sym-
metries in target space. another interesting point is that from a technical point
of view our analysis rests on the picture dependence of the brst cohomology of
the n =2 string at zero momentum and demonstrates what kind of information
may be stored in the still somewhat obscure picture phenomenon [5]. maybe,
this lesson can also be useful in some way for the n =1 string.

the letter is organised as follows: in the next section we recall some facts
about the brst cohomology of the n =2 string. these results will be used
in section three to derive an innite set of target space ward identities which
will then be explicitly evaluated so that the vanishing of the loop amplitudes
directly follows. we conclude with some further remarks and a brief discussion
of the reliability of our arguments.

2 symmetries and ground ring of the n =2 string

one of the attractive features of the brst approach to closed string theory is
that it provides an ecient means to analyse symmetries in target space. more
precisely, unbroken target space symmetries generally1 lead to the existence
of ghost number one cohomology classes (in conventions where physical states
have ghost number two). a detailed explanation of this fact is given in [7] (see
also [8]) where in addition an elegant method to derive the corresponding ward
identities  briey reviewed below  is described.

due to the fact that the closed string fock space factorises into right- and
left-moving parts ghost number one cohomology classes can be further charac-

1there are exceptions, see section ve of [6].

terised: they are most conveniently constructed as a product of a holomorphic
piece of ghost number zero and an antiholomorphic piece of ghost number one.
the latter is usually the right-moving part of a physical vertex operator, taken
at some discrete value of the momentum whereas the former very often is just
the unit operator. if, however, the chiral (= left-moving) cohomology at ghost
number zero contains further elements besides the unit operator more closed
string operators of ghost number one can be constructed resulting in a much
richer symmetry structure. an example is the bosonic string in two dimensions
[9]. moreover, interesting algebraic structures emerge. the brst cohomology
possesses a natural multiplication rule, additive in ghost number. the ghost
number zero cohomology therefore forms a ring under this multiplication (the
so-called ground ring). as has been emphasised in [10] the structure constants of
this ground ring encode much information about the symmetry of the theory2.
the n =2 string has been studied along these lines in [12, 13, 14]. based on
the fact that so many of its scattering amplitudes are known or conjectured to
vanish [4, 15, 16] and comparison with the eld theory that reproduces tree-level
scattering [15, 17] it seemed very plausible that in this theory a large symmetry
group is realized. in fact, a ground ring of the n =2 string has recently been
found in [14] and will now briey be reviewed. the construction looks somewhat
unconventional because it does not restrict to operators of a single picture only,
but takes into account the full picture degeneracy of the fock space3. however,
starting from this ground ring one may derive powerful ward identities as has
been shown for tree amplitudes in [14] and will be demonstrated in this letter
for loop amplitudes.

at zero ghost number chiral cohomology classes occur only for vanishing mo-
mentum. for low-lying picture numbers and ghost number zero the cohomology
problem is rather straightforward to solve4:

 the cohomology is empty for pictures (+, ) = {(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1)}

and consists of the unit operator in the (0, 0) picture.

 in the pictures (1, 1) and (1, 1) the cohomology consists of the spectral

ow operators

and

a(z) = (1  cb)j e+

e

(z)

(1)

a1(z) = (1 + cb)j ++e+

e

(z)

2there exist two further operations  the gerstenhaber-bracket and the  operation 
which, together with the ring multiplication, give the brst cohomology the structure of a
bv-algebra [11].

3this construction is non-trivial due to the picture dependence of the brst cohomology

of the n =2 string at zero momentum [18].

4 poincare-duality provides an isomorphism between the cohomologies for pictures (+, )
and (  2, +  2) [19]. moreover, the cohomologies for pictures (+ + ,   ) with
  1
z coincide due to spectral ow. it is therefore sucient to consider the case   1
2
only.

4 abab (see [14] for conven-
with j ++ = 1
tions and a description of the n =2 string ghost system). one may check
that a and a1 are inverse to each other with respect to ring multiplica-
tion5.

 in the (1, 0) picture the cohomology consists of the picture changing op-

erator

and the operator

x +(z) = {q, +(z)}

a  x 

with

x (z) = {q, (z)}.

it should be emphasised that a  x  is brst inequivalent to x +. analo-
gously, the (0, 1) cohomology consists of the operators x  and a1  x +.

we see that the size of the cohomology grows as the picture increases. to
obtain cohomology classes with higher integral picture numbers one may simply
consider polynomials of the operators a, a1 and x ,

(cid:0)x +(cid:1)k

(cid:0)x (cid:1)

 an,

k,   n, n  z.

note that k and  must not be negative since, contrary to n =1 strings, there do
not exist local inverse picture changing operators for the n =2 string [20] (the
cohomology at vanishing momentum and ghost number is empty for picture
numbers (1, 0) and (0, 1)).

it has been shown in [14] that all these operators are brst inequivalent !
for a given picture (+, ) we thus have constructed + +  + 1 operators,

o+,,n = (x +)++n  (x )n  an,

n = +, ..., .

(2)

to obtain ghost number one cohomology classes of the closed string connected
to the symmetries of the theory the operators in (2) have to be combined with
right-moving cohomology classes of zero momentum and ghost number one.
these operators can be found in a similar way: in [21] it has been shown that
the relevant cohomology in the (0, 0) picture is spanned by the four elements

ip a = cz a  2+a,

i p a = c z a  2+a.

(3)

here the target space lorentz indices a and a range from 0 to 1. multiplication
with o+,,n gives similar operators in higher pictures:

+,,n = o+,,n  p a,
p a
+,,n = o+,,n  p a.
p a

(4)

5multiplication of two operators, denoted by a dot in the following, means to take the

regular term in their operator product expansion [10].

3

we are now ready to write down the sought for closed string cohomology classes
of ghost number one:

a

+,,m,n = o+,,m(z) p a

+,,n(z),

m, n = +, ..., .

(5)

to save space the analogous operators a will not be explicitly mentioned in
the following. using the descent equations one may now construct an innite
set of symmetry charges and work out the transformation laws of the physical
state. this has been done in [14].

we conclude this section with one further remark. so far, we have only
considered the relative cohomology of states that are annihilated by the zero
modes of all fermionic antighosts. it would, however, be more appropriate also
to take into account states that are not annihilated by b0 + b0 which denes the
so-called semi-relative cohomology (one way to see that this is the right space to
consider is to write down a kinetic term in a string eld formalism). allowing
for more states generally changes the cohomology. but fortunately, one can
show that the operators (5) are still non-trivial in the semi-relative cohomology.
one may also wonder whether new cohomology classes turn up, as happens for
the bosonic string in two dimensions [7]. we do not know the general answer to
this question, but explicit calculations for low-lying pictures indicate that this
is not the case.

3 ward identities

we will now use the results from the previous section to derive ward identities
for n =2 string amplitudes at arbitrary genus. actually, an n =2 string scat-
tering amplitude is further characterised by a chern number classifying u (1)
bundles over the world-sheet riemann surface. it is, however, sucient to focus
on vanishing chern number in the following. this will be justied in section
four. for reasons of space the general formalism will not be reviewed in detail
here. instead, we refer to [7, 22, 23] for more extensive explanations.

the basic object involved in the computation of scattering amplitudes is the
vertex operator of the single degree of freedom in the theory. as usual, it splits
into holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts:

v (z, z, k) = v lef t(z, k) v right(z, k)

the left-moving operator is

(1,1)(z, k) = cce+
v lef t

e

eikz lef t

in the (1, 1) picture and

v(+,)(z, k) = (x +)++1  (x )+1  v(1,1)(z, k)

in higher pictures (the right-moving piece v right looks similar)6. counting
both metric and u (1) but not supersymmetry ghost number vertex operators in

6application of spectral ow only leads to vertex operators proportional to those above.

4

0 and b

closed n =2 string theory therefore have ghost number four (in our conventions
picture changing operators have ghost number zero, see [14]). moreover, they
are not annihilated by the zero modes b
0 of the u (1) antighosts. on
the other hand the ghost number one operators constructed in the previous
section are all elements of the relative cohomology, i.e. they are all killed by the
zero modes of all fermionic antighosts. it is, however, not too dicult to relate
relative cohomology classes to operators of higher ghost number, essentially by
multiplying with the relevant ghosts. in this way we can construct from the
ghost number one operators in equation (5) new cohomology classes of ghost
number three:

a

+,,m,n  a

+,,m,n  cc a

+,,m,n + . . .

here the dots refer to further terms that might be necessary to achieve brst
invariance but are unimportant otherwise.

we are now ready to derive a ward identity involving a genus g scattering

amplitude of n external states with momenta k1, . . . , kn (denoted ag
in the following). one starts with the correlator7

n (k1, . . . , kn )

*a

+,,m,n(z, z)

(6)

where (l, b) and (l, b) are the the appropriate beltrami dierentials inte-
grated with the corresponding antighosts and the index g indicates that the
correlator is meant to be evaluated with respect to the conformal eld theory
living on a riemann surface of genus g. the antighosts can be applied to the
vertex operators and the integrations can be pulled out of the brackets. let us
denote the remaining integrand by . if the operator  in (6) were replaced by
an ordinary physical vertex operator v one could integrate  over the moduli
space of a genus g surface with n + 1 punctures. from counting dimensions and
ghost numbers it follows, however, that  as dened by (6) can be integrated
only over the boundary of moduli space. in fact, it can be considered as a dif-
ferential form on moduli space of codimension one. since  can also be shown
to be a closed form [7] stokes theorem leads to the desired ward identity

zmg,n +1

 =zmg,n +1

d = 0.

(7)

the next step is to have a closer look at the n =2 string moduli space mg,n +1,
i.e. the moduli space of n =2 super riemann surfaces with genus g and n +
1 punctures (and vanishing chern number in our case).
in addition to the
usual metric and super moduli, we also have to consider the so-called u (1)
moduli [3] describing a continuum of possible monodromy phases for the world-
sheet fermions arising from their transport along non-trivial homology cycles.

7for simplicity we only consider closed string operators whose left- and right-moving picture

numbers coincide.

5

however, the u (1) moduli space is compact (it always has the topology of a
torus) and therefore does not contribute to the boundary of moduli space. as a
result, in our ward identity (7) only the familiar boundary components of the
metric moduli space appear.

the metric moduli are of two dierent types. one corresponds to the shape
of the underlying riemann surface whereas the other describes punctures, i.e.
the locations of the vertex operators. if we move to the boundary of moduli space
the riemann surface degenerates in some way. in the following it is convenient
to distinguish four dierent cases: first of all, the underlying surface may pinch
either along a trivial or a non-trivial homology cycle. if a genus g surface pinches
along a non-trivial cycle it becomes a surface of genus g  1 with two points
coinciding. if it pinches along a trivial cycle the result is a connected pair of
riemann surfaces with genera g1 and g2 such that g1 + g2 = g. for a g=2
surface with four punctures these two cases are illustrated in the top row of the
gure below. it may also happen that a number of punctures approach each
other. this is conformally equivalent to a situation where a sphere containing
the relevant punctures splits o of the rest of the surface. this is illustrated in
the bottom line of the gure, where we also distinguished whether two vertex
operators v approach each other or one v approaches the ghost number three
operator .

to see how a pinch (denoted by p in the gure) can properly be included
in the computation let us recall that it can equivalently be described by an
innitely long cylinder. this cylinder can be taken into account by inserting
a complete set of physical states.
in this formulation the twist angle of the
cylinder is one of the moduli leading to an insertion of the metric antighost
combination b(z)  b(z). so the pinch can be represented by the sum

xi

|boiihoi|
|boii = (b0  b0)|oii.

(8)

(9)

where i labels a basis of the absolute brst cohomology and

hoj |oii = i
j,

what about the fermionic and u (1) moduli ? the former are correctly taken into
account by obeying the right selection rules for picture numbers [24]. moreover,
a pinch contributes one complex u (1) modulus. this corresponds to the fact
that the complete set of states (8) carries two units of u (1) ghost number  just
enough to compensate the antighost insertion due to the u (1) modulus of the
pinch.

let us now become more explicit: we assume n  3, i.e.

the presence
of at least three vertex operators, and genus g > 0 since tree-level amplitudes
have been discussed in [14]. it will also be sucient and technically simpler to
consider only operators  (and the corresponding ) of the form

a

n(z, z) := a

n,n,n,n(z, z) = an(z) an  p a(z),

which have picture numbers (n, n). the four cases mentioned above will now
be discussed in turn.

3.1 case 1: a non-trivial homology cycle pinches

besides the n physical vertex operators already present the pinching leads to

an insertion of two further vertex operators oi and boi, as explained above. so

we have to evaluate the expression

.

(10)

xi (cid:10)(cid:10)a

n v1 . . . vn boi oi(cid:11)(cid:11)g1

(cid:2)q, b(1)(cid:3) = b,

7

here, the notation for the vertex operators has been simplied in a hopefully ob-
vious way. the double bracket as usual denotes evaluation of the full amplitude
including integration over moduli space.

to further evaluate the expression (10) let us note that it contains at least six
operators (since we assumed n  3 in the beginning). regardless of the value of
g integration over moduli space leads for this number of operators to insertions
of metric antighosts that transform cohomology classes into integrated vertex
operators. since this eect will be crucial in the following, we briey review
some details:
assume the operator b(z) b(z) represents a closed string cohomology class.
from the explicit form of the brst operator it follows that

b(1)(z) =iz

dw
2i

b(w)b(z)

satises the relation

q being the left-moving part of the brst operator. since this argument goes

through for the right-moving half, as well, a b-ghost insertion leads to the inte-
grated operator

z d2zb(1)(z) b(1)(z)

which is brst invariant since the integrand transforms into a total derivative.
in practice, going over from a cohomology class to an integrated vertex operator
simply amounts to getting rid of the undierentiated c- and c-ghosts. if some
cohomology class does not contain both these ghost elds (as for example the
unit operator) its integrated form is zero.

we are always free to choose where to locate the b-ghost insertions8, i.e.
which cohomology class to convert into an integrated operator. in the present
case we can pick . from the explicit form of a in equation (1) one sees that
stripping o a c-ghost necessarily leads to the presence of a b-ghost, for example
a(1) = bj e+
e. however, there is no corresponding c-ghost in sight
to compensate b in a correlation function. so we learn from simple u (1) ghost
number counting that the amplitude (10) vanishes! in other words, the kind
of degeneration considered in this subsection does not contribute to the ward
identity.

3.2 case 2: a trivial homology cycle pinches

the contribution to the ward identity of this component of the boundary is

xi, (cid:10)(cid:10)vu1 . . . vup a

nboi(cid:11)(cid:11)g1(cid:10)(cid:10)oivup+1 . . . vun(cid:11)(cid:11)g2

(11)

with g1 + g2 = g and g1, g2 > 0. the sum over  runs over all possible ways to
divide the set of n physical vertex operators into a subset {vu1 . . . vup } on the
genus g1 surface and the remainder {vup+1 . . . vun } located on the other surface.
since g1 is strictly positive and the correlation function involving  con-
tains at least one further operator the expression (11) can again be evaluated
by transforming  to its integrated form. as in the previous subsection the
vanishing of (11) then follows from u (1) ghost number counting.

3.3 case 3: a sphere not including  splits o

in this case we have to evaluate the expression

xi, (cid:10)(cid:10)vu1 . . . vupa

nboi(cid:11)(cid:11)g(cid:10)(cid:10)oivup+1 . . . vun(cid:11)(cid:11)g=0

.

(12)

since g > 0 by assumption the correlator involving  vanishes by the same
argument as above.

8since we are dealing with vertex operators of non-standard ghost number, this is not
completely obvious in the path integral formulation. in the operator formalism , however, one
may explicitly check that the location of the b-ghost insertion is immaterial.

8

3.4 case 4: a sphere including  splits o

in this nal case the contribution to the ward identity reads

xi, (cid:10)(cid:10)vu1 . . . vupa

nboi(cid:11)(cid:11)g=0(cid:10)(cid:10)oivup+1 . . . vun(cid:11)(cid:11)g

.

(13)

the ghost number three operator  now appears in a tree-level amplitude whose
evaluation involves metric antighost insertions as soon as more than three oper-
ators are present. correspondingly, terms in the -sum vanish by the standard
argument whenever the g = 0 correlator involves more than one operator v

besides  and boi. what remains are those degenerations where  splits o

with precisely one vertex operator v . these are the only contributions to the
ward identity:

nxu=1xi (cid:10)vua

nboi(cid:11)g=0(cid:10)(cid:10)oiv1 . . . vu1 vu+1 . . . vn(cid:11)(cid:11)g = 0.

obviously, the only non-vanishing term in the above sum over i occurs when oi
coincides with the vertex operator vu. in each term of the u-sum the second
correlator therefore is just the genus g amplitude of n physical states ag
n .
reinserting the momenta ku allows us to rewrite the ward identity as

ag

n (k1, . . . , kn ) 

nxu=1(cid:10)v (ku)a

nbv (ku)(cid:11)g=0 = 0.

these identities have already been derived in [14] for tree amplitudes. equations
(15) tell us that they do not get modied for higher genera. the remaining
correlator can be evaluated as

(14)

(15)

the nal identities for the genus g amplitude thus read

(cid:10)v (k)a

nbv (k)(cid:11)g=0 =(cid:18) k0

(16)

for any n  z

(17)

and imply the vanishing of all amplitudes with n  4 [14]. the three point
function, however, is generally non-zero. one may for example check that the
tree-level amplitude

ag=0

n =3(k1, k2, k3) =(cid:0)k1  k2  k2  k1(cid:1)2

satises all identities without being zero. on dimensional grounds it seems very
plausible that for higher genus the three point function is just a power of the
tree-level result:

ag

n =3(k1, k2, k3) = g(cid:0)k1  k2  k2  k1(cid:1)4g+2

here the pre-factor g depends on the genus but not on the momenta. explicit
computations at one loop show that g=1 is divergent [25, 26]. this concludes
our discussion of the scattering amplitudes of the n =2 string.

9

4 some remarks

so far we have ignored the possibility of non-vanishing chern number c, corre-
sponding to topologically non-trivial congurations of the u (1) gauge eld on
the world-sheet. a careful evaluation of the path integral shows that a non-zero
chern number can be simulated by inserting (a power of) the spectral ow op-
erator a into the c = 0 correlation function and simultaneously adjusting the
picture numbers of the vertex operators [3]. since the derivative of the spec-
tral ow operator is brst trivial each a (or a1) can be moved towards one
of the vertex operators and simply pulls out a momentum factor h(k) (or its
inverse, see eq. (16) for a denition of h). therefore, amplitudes with dierent
chern number are proportional to one another. hence, it is sucient to prove
the vanishing of a scattering amplitude for one xed value of c. secondly we
have ignored that, as a riemann surface with c = 0 degenerates and splits into
two, the resulting surfaces may have non-vanishing chern numbers c and c.
so we actually should include in our ward identity a summation over all such
splittings9. however, we have just explained that this only leads to additional
factors h(k)c and h(k)c which cancel each other (k is the momentum owing
through the pinch). this justies our treatment where we completely neglected
sectors with non-zero chern number.

a further point that deserves to be mentioned is the question of non-linear
contributions to the symmetries. one of the remarkable features of the n =2
string that make it such an interesting toy model is the fact that we know a
simple eld theory that reproduces the tree-level amplitudes to all orders in
. this eld theory is well known to possess a highly non-linear symmetry
structure. in [14] the linearised version of the unbroken symmetries on the eld
theory side was compared to the transformation rules of the n =2 string vertex
operators under the symmetries that lead to the above ward identities. they
were found to coincide.
in fact, the hilbert space in our formulation of the
theory consists only of single string states. so it seems at rst sight correct to
restrict a comparison between symmetries in eld theory and string theory to
the linear level. however, it has been explained in [7] (section 6) that non-linear
symmetry structures can make their appearance in a rst quantised string theory
at the level of ward identities. more precisely, a non-linear contribution to a
ward identity corresponds to a situation where the ghost number one (three for
n =2 strings) operator  splits o with more than one further vertex operator.
in this case only the overlap between the charge acting on a single vertex op-
erator with a multi-string state is sent through the pinch. in other words, a
symmetry is realized non-linearly precisely when the tree-level amplitude

(cid:10)(cid:10) v (k1) . . . v (kn1)bv (kn)(cid:11)(cid:11)g=0

is non-vanishing for n  3. a model where this indeed happens is the bosonic
string in two dimensions. yet it has been argued in section three that in our case

9this sum is nite since supersymmetry ghost zero modes kill correlators when |c| exceeds

a certain value.

non-linear contribution to the ward identity

of the n =2 string the relevant correlation functions vanish. as a consequence
the ward identity (17) is linear. this indicates a clear discrepancy to the eld
theory and suggests that the behaviour of the n =2 string is not fully captured
by its tree-level eective eld theory.

last but not least we should give our opinion on the reliability of our argu-
ments. in fact, we must admit that the analysis of the boundary of the n =2
string moduli space has been somewhat heuristic. it is mainly based on count-
ing of dimensions and ghost numbers. hidden subtleties might be detected by a
more careful investigation. for example, it is conceivable that the u (1) moduli
space behaves in some discontinuous way as the riemann surface degenerates.
whether or not this is the case can only be answered by studying the relevant
index theorem. other potential diculties are related to the fermionic moduli
that we have treated in a rather straightforward way, ignoring possible ambi-
guities due to the location of picture changing operators. in any case it would
be helpful to have an explicit computation of the one-loop four point function.
if that turns out to be non-vanishing it will be extremely interesting to see by
which mechanism the derivation of the ward identities must be modied.
