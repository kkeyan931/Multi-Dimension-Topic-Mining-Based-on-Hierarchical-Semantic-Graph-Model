on counting special lagrangian homology

3-spheres

dominic joyce

lincoln college, oxford, ox1 3dr

1 introduction

it is well known [14] that one can dene gromovwitten invariants of sym-
plectic manifolds (m, ) by choosing a generic compatible metric g and al-
most complex structure j on m, and counting the j-holomorphic curves  in
m in a given homology class, with signs. the invariants are then essentially
independent of the choice of g, j. as j-holomorphic curves are calibrated 2-
submanifolds with respect to the calibration  on the riemannian manifold
(m, g), gromovwitten invariants arise by counting the simplest nontrivial
kind of calibrated submanifold.

in this paper we shall attempt to dene a similar invariant i of generic (al-
most) calabiyau 3-folds (m, j, , ) by counting another kind of calibrated
submanifold, special lagrangian 3-submanifolds, or sl 3-folds for short. in
fact we shall consider only special lagrangian rational homology 3-spheres,
as they occur in 0-dimensional moduli spaces, and can be counted. let s()
be the set of sl homology 3-spheres in m with homology class . suppose
s() is nite. then we shall dene

i() = xns()

w(n),

(1)

where w(n) is a rational weight function depending on the topology of n.
for i to be interesting it should either be unchanged by smooth deforma-
tions of the underlying almost calabiyau structure (j, , ), or else should
transform according to some rigid set of rules as [] and [] move about
in h 2(m, r) and h 3(m, c). now whether such an invariant can be made

1

to work, and how it should be dened, depends very much on the singular
behaviour of special lagrangian 3-folds, which is not well understood. there-
fore much of this paper is conjectural, though i hope to be able to publish
proofs of many of the conjectures in the next few years, unless someone else
does rst.

here is why singularities of sl 3-folds are important in this problem. in
the moduli space of almost calabi-yau structures on m there are certain
special real hypersurfaces, determined using the homology of m. at such a
hypersurface, some of the sl 3-folds in m will become singular. an sl 3-fold
may exist in m only on one side of the hypersurface, and become singular
at the hypersurface.

more generally, as we approach the hypersurface from one side, one or
more sl 3-folds may collapse down to a singular sl 3-fold, and then on the
other side this singular sl 3-fold is replaced by a dierent collection of one
or more sl 3-folds. the key question addressed in this paper is to nd a way
to dene the invariant i so that it is unchanged, or transforms in a controlled
way, as we cross these hypersurfaces and the set of sl 3-folds that we are
counting changes.

in 34 and 56 we study two kinds of singularity that sl 3-folds can
develop, modelled respectively on a t 2-cone in c3, and the union of two sl
3-planes r3 in c3. we use these transitions to calculate identities which the
weight function w(n) in (1) must satisfy for i to be invariant, or transform
nicely, as we pass through the hypersurface.
it turns out that the simple

weight function w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) satises these identities.

motivated by this, we formulate a conjecture, conjecture 7.3, giving a
partial denition of i, and a partial statement of the transformation law it
should satisfy under deformation. a full denition and transformation law
(if the invariant works at all) will have to await a better understanding of
singular sl 3-folds. we conclude in 7.6 with a discussion of the relationship
of the invariants to string theory. the author believes that they count
objects of signicance in string theory, namely isolated 3-branes, and that
they should play a role in mirror symmetry of calabiyau 3-folds.

2 special lagrangian geometry

we now introduce the idea of special lagrangian submanifolds (sl m-folds),
in two dierent geometric contexts. first, in 2.1, we dene sl m-folds in
cm. then 2.2 discusses sl m-folds in almost calabiyau m-folds, compact
kahler manifolds equipped with a holomorphic volume form which generalize
the idea of calabiyau manifolds. finally, section 2.3 considers the singu-
larities of sl m-folds. the principal references for this section are harvey
and lawson [5] and the author [12].

2.1 special lagrangian submanifolds in cm

we begin by dening calibrations and calibrated submanifolds, following har-
vey and lawson [5].

denition 2.1 let (m, g) be a riemannian manifold. an oriented tangent
k-plane v on m is a vector subspace v of some tangent space txm to m
with dim v = k, equipped with an orientation. if v is an oriented tangent
k-plane on m then g|v is a euclidean metric on v , so combining g|v with the
orientation on v gives a natural volume form volv on v , which is a k-form
on v .

now let  be a closed k-form on m. we say that  is a calibration
on m if for every oriented k-plane v on m we have |v  volv . here
|v =   volv for some   r, and |v  volv if   1. let n be an
oriented submanifold of m with dimension k. then each tangent space txn
for x  n is an oriented tangent k-plane. we say that n is a calibrated
submanifold if |txn = voltxn for all x  n.

it is easy to show that calibrated submanifolds are automatically minimal
submanifolds [5, th. ii.4.2]. here is the denition of special lagrangian
submanifolds in cm, taken from [5, iii].

denition 2.2 let cm have complex coordinates (z1, . . . , zm), and dene
a metric g, a real 2-form  and a complex m-form  on cm by

g = |dz1|2 +    + |dzm|2,  = i

2(dz1  dz1 +    + dzm  dzm),

and  = dz1      dzm.

(2)

then re  and im  are real m-forms on cm. let l be an oriented real
submanifold of cm of real dimension m. we say that l is a special lagrangian

3

submanifold of cm, or sl m-fold for short, if l is calibrated with respect to
re , in the sense of denition 2.1.

harvey and lawson [5, cor. iii.1.11] give the following alternative char-

acterization of special lagrangian submanifolds:

proposition 2.3 let l be a real m-dimensional submanifold of cm. then
l admits an orientation making it into an sl submanifold of cm if and only
if |l  0 and im |l  0.

an m-dimensional submanifold l in cm is called lagrangian if |l  0.
thus special lagrangian submanifolds are lagrangian submanifolds satisfy-
ing the extra condition that im |l  0, which is how they get their name.

2.2 almost calabiyau m-folds and sl m-folds

we shall dene special lagrangian submanifolds not just in calabiyau man-
ifolds, as usual, but in the much larger class of almost calabiyau manifolds.

denition 2.4 let m  2. an almost calabiyau m-fold, or acy m-
fold for short, is a quadruple (m, j, , ) such that (m, j) is a compact
m-dimensional complex manifold,  is the kahler form of a kahler metric g
on m, and  is a non-vanishing holomorphic (m, 0)-form on m.

we call (m, j, , ) a calabiyau m-fold, or cy m-fold for short, if in

addition  and  satisfy

m/m! = (1)m(m1)/2(i/2)m  .

(3)

then for each x  m there exists an isomorphism txm = cm that identies
gx, x and x with the at versions g, ,  on cm in (2). furthermore, g is
ricci-at and its holonomy group is a subgroup of su(m).

this is not the usual denition of a calabiyau manifold, but is essentially

equivalent to it.

denition 2.5 let (m, j, , ) be an almost calabiyau m-fold, and n
an oriented real m-dimensional submanifold of m. fix   r. we call n a
special lagrangian submanifold, or sl m-fold for short, with phase ei if

|n  0

and (sin  re   cos  im )|n  0,

(4)

and cos  re  + sin  im  is a positive m-form on the oriented m-fold n.

4

again, this is not the usual denition of special lagrangian submani-
fold, but is essentially equivalent to it. compared to denition 2.1 we have
introduced two changes:

(a) the denition now involves a phase ei, and

(b) sl m-folds are dened by the vanishing of forms  and sin  re  

cos  im , rather than as calibrated submanifolds.

the following easy lemma relates the phase of a compact sl m-fold to its
homology class.

lemma 2.6 let (m, j, , ) be an almost calabiyau m-fold, and n a
compact sl m-fold in m with phase ei. then

[]  [n] = rei, where r = zn

cos  re  + sin  im  > 0,

(5)

[]  h m(m, c) and [n]  hm(m, z). thus the homology class [n] deter-
mines the phase ei of n.

if we study only sl m-folds n in a xed homology class in m, then
by replacing  by ei we can suppose that n has phase 1, and so avoid
introducing phases. however, we will later need to consider several sl 3-
folds n1, n2, n3 in dierent homology classes in a calabiyau 3-fold m,
with dierent phases, so we can discuss what happens to sl 3-folds as we
vary []  h 3(m, c). this is why we introduced change (a).

using the analogue of proposition 2.3 one can show that if (m, j, , )
is a calabiyau manifold, then n is special lagrangian with phase ei if
and only if it is calibrated w.r.t. cos  re  + sin  im . more generally
[12, 9.4], sl m-folds in an almost calabiyau m-fold are calibrated w.r.t.
cos  re  + sin  im , but for a suitably conformally rescaled metric g.

thus, we can give an equivalent denition of sl m-folds in terms of
calibrated geometry, and change (b) above is only cosmetic. nonetheless, in
the authors view the denition of sl m-folds in terms of the vanishing of
closed forms is more fundamental than the denition in terms of calibrated
geometry, and so should be taken as the primary denition.

the deformation theory of special lagrangian submanifolds was studied
by mclean [15, 3], who proved the following result in the calabiyau case
with phase 1. the extension to the acy case is described in [12, 9.5].

5

theorem 2.7 let (m, j, , ) be an almost calabiyau m-fold, and n a
compact sl m-fold in m. then the moduli space mn of special lagrangian
deformations of n is a smooth manifold of dimension b1(n), the rst betti
number of n. all elements of mn have the same phase ei, given by [] 
[n] = rei for r > 0.

using similar methods one can prove [12, 9.3, 9.5]:

theorem 2.8 let (cid:8)(m, jt, t, t) : t  (, )(cid:9) be a smooth 1-parameter
family of almost calabiyau m-folds. let n0 be a compact sl m-fold in
(m, j0, 0, 0), and suppose [t|n0] = 0 in h 2(n0, r) for all t  (, ).
then n0 extends to a smooth 1-parameter family (cid:8)nt : t  (, )(cid:9), where
0 <    and nt is a compact sl m-fold in (m, jt, t, t), with phase eit
determined by [t]  [n0] = rteit for rt > 0.

now suppose that (m, j, , ) is an almost calabiyau 3-fold, and n is
a special lagrangian (rational) homology 3-sphere in m. then h 1(n, r) =
h 2(n, r) = 0. thus by theorem 2.7 the moduli space mn has dimension
0, so that n is rigid (that is, it admits no nontrivial deformations as an sl
3-fold in m). also, as h 2(n, r) = 0 the condition [t|n ] = 0 in theorem 2.8
holds automatically for any family of deformations (jt, t, t) of the almost
calabiyau structure (j, , ) on m. thus, theorem 2.8 shows that n is
stable under small deformations of (j, , ), giving:

corollary 2.9 let (m, j, , ) be an almost calabiyau 3-fold, and n a
special lagrangian homology 3-sphere in m. then n is rigid, and stable
under small deformations of the almost calabiyau structure (j, , ) on m.

one moral of this is that special lagrangian homology 3-spheres in an
almost calabiyau 3-fold may be a good thing to count, as they are isolated
and persistent under small deformations. we will discuss this in 7.

2.3 singularities of sl m-folds

the authors series of papers [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] is mainly concerned
with the study of singularities of sl m-folds in cm and in almost calabi
yau manifolds. this is done both by the construction of many examples of
singular sl m-folds in cm, and also through the development of a (partly

6

conjectural) picture of how families of nonsingular sl m-folds can become
singular, particularly when the underlying almost calabiyau manifold is
assumed to be generic.

we shall now briey summarize some denitions and conjectures taken
from [12, 10]. the author has sketch proofs for the conjectures (at least in
complex dimension m < 6) and hopes to publish full proofs fairly soon. for
more details and motivation, see [12]. here are some denitions to do with
special lagrangian cones in cm.

denition 2.10 a (singular) sl m-fold c in cm is called a cone if c = tc
for all t > 0, where tc = {tx : x  c}. let c be an sl cone in cm. then
either c is an m-plane rm in cm, or c is singular at 0. we are interested
primarily in sl cones c in which 0 is the only singular point, that is, in which
0 is an isolated singularity. then  = c  s2m1 is a compact, nonsingular
(m  1)-submanifold of s2m1. we dene the number of ends at innity of
c to be the number k of connected components of .

let c be an sl cone in cm with an isolated singularity at 0, and let
 = c  s2m1. regard  as a compact riemannian manifold, with metric
induced from the round metric in s2m1. let  = dd be the laplacian on
functions on . dene the legendrian index l-ind(c) to be the number of
eigenvalues of  in (0, 2m), counted with multiplicity.

let the connected components of  be 1, . . . , k. dene the cone c to
be rigid if for each j = 1, . . . , k, the eigenspace of  on j with eigenvalue
2m has dimension dim su(m)  dim gj, where gj is the lie subgroup of
su(m) preserving j.

the point of these denitions is that the legendrian index of c is that
 is a minimal legendrian submanifold in s2m1, and is thus a stationary
point of the area functional amongst all legendrian submanifolds in s2m1.
the legendrian index is the index of this stationary point. the cone c is
the union of one-ended cones c1, . . . , ck intersecting at 0, and c is rigid if
all innitesimal deformations of cj as an sl cone come from innitesimal
rotations of cj by su(m) matrices, for each j.

now sl cones are important because they are local models for the sim-
plest kind of singularities of sl m-folds in almost calabiyau m-folds. to
understand how singular sl m-folds modelled upon an sl cone c in cm can
arise as limits of nonsingular sl m-folds, we need to consider sl m-folds l
in cm asymptotic to c at innity.

7

denition 2.11 let c be an sl cone in cm with isolated singularity at 0,
and let  = c s2m1, so that  is a compact, nonsingular (m1)-manifold.
let h be the metric on  induced by the metric g on cm, and r the radius
function on cm. dene  :   (0, )  cm by (, r) = r. then the image
of  is c \ {0}, and (g) = r2h + dr2 is the cone metric on c \ {0}.

let l be a closed, nonsingular sl m-fold in cm. we call l asymptotically
conical (ac) with cone c if there exists a compact subset k  l and
a dieomorphism  :   (r, )  l \ k for some r > 0, such that

|  | = o(r) and (cid:12)(cid:12)k(  )(cid:12)(cid:12) = o(r1k) as r   for k = 1, 2, . . . , where 

is the levi-civita connection of the cone metric (g), and | . | is computed
using (g).

in [12, 10] this notion of asymptotically conical is referred to as weakly
asymptotically conical, to distinguish it from a second class of strongly
asymptotically conical sl m-folds which converge to c to order o(r1)
rather than o(r). however, we will not need the idea of strongly ac sl m-
folds in this paper. the following conjecture [12, conj. 10.3] is the analogue
of theorem 2.7 for ac sl m-folds.

conjecture 2.12 let l be an ac sl m-fold in cm, with cone c, and let k
be the number of ends of c at innity. then the moduli space ml of ac sl
m-folds in cm with cone c is near l a smooth manifold of dimension b1(l)+
k  1 + l-ind(c).

our next conjecture [12, conj. 10.7] is a rst approximation to the kinds
of deformation results the author expects to hold for singular sl m-folds in
almost calabiyau m-folds.

conjecture 2.13 let c be a rigid sl cone in cm with an isolated singu-
larity at 0 and k ends at innity, and l be an ac sl m-fold in cm with
cone c. let (m, j, , ) be a generic almost calabiyau m-fold, and m a
connected moduli space of compact nonsingular sl m-folds n in m.

suppose that at the boundary of m there is a moduli space mc of com-
pact, singular sl m-folds with one isolated singular point modelled on the
cone c, which arise as limits of sl m-folds in m by collapsing ac sl m-
folds with the topology of l. then

dim m = dim mc + b1(l) + k  1 + l-ind(c)  2m.

(6)

8

suppose we have a suitably generic almost calabiyau m-fold m and
a compact, singular sl m-fold n0 in m, which is the limit of a family of
compact nonsingular sl m-folds n in m. we (loosely) dene the index
of the singularities of n0 to be the codimension of the family of singular
sl m-folds with singularities like those of n0 in the family of nonsingular
sl m-folds n. thus, in the situation of conjecture 2.13, the index of the
singularities is b1(l) + k  1 + l-ind(c)  2m.

more generally, one can work not just with a xed generic almost calabi
yau m-fold, but with a generic family of almost calabiyau m-folds. so, for
instance, if we have a generic k-dimensional family of almost calabiyau
m-folds m, and in each m we have an l-dimensional family of sl m-folds,
then in the total (k+l)-dimensional family of sl m-folds we are guaranteed
to meet singularities of index at most k+l.

now later in the paper we shall study the behaviour of 0-dimensional
families of sl 3-folds in generic 1-dimensional families of almost calabiyau
3-folds.
in such families we will only meet singularities of index 1. this
is a very useful fact, as it means there will be only a few kinds of singular
behaviour to worry about in determining how the invariants we dene behave
under deformations of the underlying almost calabiyau 3-fold.

one important reason we have chosen to work in almost calabiyau man-
ifolds, rather than just in calabiyau manifolds, is that almost calabiyau
manifolds occur in innite-dimensional families. thus, taking the underly-
ing almost calabiyau manifold to be generic is a very powerful assumption,
and should simplify the singular behaviour of sl m-folds considerably. (for
instance, one can argue that a compact sl 3-fold in a generic almost calabi
yau 3-fold has at most nitely many singular points.) however, calabi
yau manifolds only occur in nite-dimensional families, and so working in a
generic calabiyau manifold is not that strong an assumption, and probably
will not help very much.

3 a model degeneration of sl 3-folds

we now dene an explicit sl cone l0 in c3 and three families of ac sl
3-folds la
t in c3 with cone l0, and analyze them in the framework of 2.3.

9

3.1 three families of sl 3-folds in c3

let g be the group u(1)2, acting on c3 by

(ei1, ei2) : (z1, z2, z3) 7 (ei1z1, ei2z2, ei1i2z3)

for 1, 2  r.

(7)

all the g-invariant special lagrangian 3-folds in c3 were written down ex-
plicitly by harvey and lawson [5, iii.3.a], and studied in more detail in [6,
ex. 5.1] and [9, 4]. here are some examples of g-invariant sl 3-folds which
will be important in what follows.
denition 3.1 dene a subset l0 in c3 by

l0 = (cid:8)(z1, z2, z3)  c3 : |z1|2 = |z2|2 = |z3|2,

im(z1z2z3) = 0, re(z1z2z3)  0(cid:9).

(8)

then l0 is a special lagrangian cone on t 2, invariant under the lie subgroup
g of su(3) given in (7). let t > 0, and dene

(9)

t = (cid:8)(z1, z2, z3)  c3 : |z1|2  t = |z2|2 = |z3|2,
l1
l2
t = (cid:8)(z1, z2, z3)  c3 : |z1|2 = |z2|2  t = |z3|2,
l3
t = (cid:8)(z1, z2, z3)  c3 : |z1|2 = |z2|2 = |z3|2  t,

im(z1z2z3) = 0, re(z1z2z3)  0(cid:9).
im(z1z2z3) = 0, re(z1z2z3)  0(cid:9),
im(z1z2z3) = 0, re(z1z2z3)  0(cid:9).
then it can be shown that each la
t is a g-invariant, nonsingular, embedded
special lagrangian 3-submanifold in c3 dieomorphic to s1  r2, which is
asymptotically conical in the sense of denition 2.10, with cone l0.

(10)

(11)

thus the la

t for a = 1, 2, 3 are three dierent families of ac sl 3-folds
in c3 asymptotic to the same sl cone l0, each family depending on a real
parameter t > 0. dene subsets d1

t in c3 for a > 0 by

t and 1
t = (cid:8)(z1, 0, 0) : z1  c,

|z1|2  t(cid:9).

(12)

t = (cid:8)(t1/2 ei, 0, 0) :   r(cid:9), d1
1

is a smooth, oriented s1 in l1

then 1
t
morphic disc in c3 with area t and boundary 1
t generates h1(l1
1
boundary 2
t in l2

t , z) = z. there are similar holomorphic discs d2
t , and d3

is a closed, oriented holo-
t . the homology class of
t with

t with boundary 3

t , and d1
t

t in l3
t .

10

3.2 using l0 and the la

t as local models

next we apply the ideas of 2.3 to l0 and the la
t .
lemma 3.2 in the notation of 2.3, the sl cone l0 and ac sl 3-folds la
t
satisfy k = 1, b1(la

t ) = 1 and l-ind(l0) = 6, and l0 is rigid.

proof. as l0 is a t 2-cone we have k = 1, and as la
is dieomorphic to
t
s1  r2 we have b1(la
t ) = 1. it is not dicult to show that the metric on
 = t 2 is isometric to the quotient of r2 with its at euclidean metric by
, 12(cid:1). the eigenvectors of  on
the lattice z2 with basis 2(cid:0)

 lift to functions of the form sin(x + y), cos(x + y) on r2 which are
invariant under lattice translations.

23

, 0(cid:1), 2(cid:0) 16

calculation shows that the only eigenvalue of  in (0, 6) is 2, with multi-
plicity 6, and so l-ind(l0) = 6. similarly,  has eigenvalue 6 with multiplicity
6, and as dim su(3) = 8 and the subgroup g of su(3) preserving l0 is u(1)2
with dimension 2, we see that l0 is rigid as 6 = 8  2.
(cid:3)

assuming conjecture 2.12, we see that the moduli space of ac sl 3-folds
l with cone l0 and b1(l) = 1 is 1-dimensional. it follows that any such l
must be g-invariant, as otherwise the g-orbit of l and its rescalings would
ll out a moduli space of larger dimension. thus any such l is one of the
la

t , and we have:

corollary 3.3 suppose conjecture 2.12 holds when m = 3. then the moduli
space of ac sl 3-folds l in c3 with cone l0 and b1(l) = 1 is {la
: a =
t
1, 2, 3, t > 0}.

assuming conjecture 2.13, we deduce:

corollary 3.4 suppose conjecture 2.13 holds when m = 3. let (m, j, , )
be a generic almost calabiyau 3-fold, and m a connected moduli space of
compact nonsingular sl 3-folds n in m. suppose that at the boundary of m
there is a moduli space m0 of compact, singular sl 3-folds with one isolated
singular point modelled on the cone l0, which arise as limits of sl 3-folds in
m by collapsing ac sl 3-folds of the form la
t . then dim m = dim m0 + 1.

thus, in the sense discussed in 2.3, singularities of sl 3-folds modelled
on the sl cone l0 should have index one. that is, they should occur in
codimension 1 in families of sl 3-folds in a generic almost calabiyau 3-
fold, or more generally in generic families of almost calabiyau 3-folds.

11

3.3

interpretation in terms of holomorphic discs

here is an informal way to understand why singularities of sl 3-folds mod-
elled on l0 should have index one, in terms of holomorphic discs. given a
symplectic manifold (m, ) with compatible almost complex structure j, and
a lagrangian submanifold n in m, one can consider j-holomorphic discs d
in m with boundary d in n.

the behaviour of such j-holomorphic discs is well understood, because
of their application in the floer homology of lagrangian submanifolds. it
is known (see for instance [2, th. 3.11]) that if j and n are suciently
generic, then moduli spaces of j-holomorphic discs are smooth manifolds,
with dimension given by a topological formula.

in our case, as n is special lagrangian the maslov index of d is au-
tomatically 0, and as m = 3 the formula gives dimension 0 for the moduli
space of holomorphic discs. the conclusion is that if (m, j, , ) is a generic
almost calabiyau 3-fold and n an sl 3-fold in m, then holomorphic discs
d with boundary d in n are expected to be both isolated and stable, so
that they persist under small deformations of (j, , ) and n.

in the situation of corollary 3.4, suppose that n0 is a singular sl 3-fold
in m0 with singular point x, and n is an sl 3-fold in m close to n0. then
we expect that n should be modelled near x on some la
t for small t > 0.
(this will be made more precise in 4.) since there is a holomorphic disc
da
t , and such discs are isolated and stable under
small perturbations, we expect that there should exist a holomorphic disc d
in m with boundary in n modelled on da
t .

t in c3 with boundary in la

as d is calibrated with respect to , its area is rd . thus, the area
of d is given topologically in terms of relative homology and cohomology
by the formula area(d) = []m ;n  [d]m ;n , where []m ;n  h 2(m; n, r)
and [d]m ;n  h2(m; n, z). but also, the area of d is necessarily positive.
when the area shrinks to zero, the boundary s1 of d in n is collapsed to a
point, and n develops a singularity, a t 2-cone.

thus, we have the following picture. regard [d]m,n as a xed class
  h2(m; n, z). as we continuously vary (m, j, , ) and n, the class
[]m ;n varies in h 2(m; n, r). on m we have []m ;n   > 0, and m0 is
the boundary where []m ;n   = 0. so, singularities modelled on the cone
l0 should occur at the zeroes of one topologically determined real function
[]m ;n   on the moduli space of sl 3-folds, which explains why they happen
in codimension one.

12

the author expects that the sl cone l0 in c3 is the generic local model
for singularities of sl 3-folds which occur when the area of a holomorphic
disc d with boundary in an sl 3-fold n shrinks to zero.

4 topological behaviour of these singularities

in 3 we argued that singularities modelled on the sl cone l0 are of index
one, in the sense of 2.3. therefore we expect singularities modelled on l0
to occur in codimension one in families of sl 3-folds in generic families of
almost calabiyau 3-folds. we shall consider such a family, and investigate
the topological consequences.

4.1 sl 3-folds with t 2-cone singularities

in the following condition we set out the situation we want to study, an sl
3-fold in an almost calabiyau 3-fold with one singular point modelled on
l0, and establish some notation.

condition 4.1 let (m, j0, 0, 0) be an almost calabiyau 3-fold, and
n0 a compact, embedded, singular sl 3-fold in m with phase ei and one
singular point at x  m, locally modelled on l0. to be more precise, let
 > 0 be small, b and b be the open and closed balls of radius  about
0 in c3, and (j, , ) the euclidean calabiyau structure on b  c3.
suppose there exists a c 1 embedding 0 : b  m which is smooth except
perhaps at 0, such that

(a) 0(0) = x and 0(n0) = l0  b;

(b) 0(0) = ; and

(c) 0(j0)  j and 0(0)  f ei near 0  b, for some f > 0.

suppose also that h1(n0, r) = {0}.

here are some remarks on this condition:

 as our conclusions will be conjectural, we will not worry very much
about the details here  for instance, exactly what sort of approximation
is required in part (c), or how many derivatives of 0 exist at x.

13

 we have chosen the coordinate system 0 to equate the symplectic
structures 0 on m and  on c3. this is possible by the darboux
lemma. as there are so many symplectomorphisms we can also arrange
that (0)(n0) = l0  b, possibly at the cost of 0 not being smooth
at 0. however, 0 will in general not be holomorphic, so we can only
assume that 0(j0)  j and 0(0)  f ei.
here the factor ei is to compensate for the fact that n0 has phase ei
and l0 has phase 1, and f is to allow for the fact that as (m, j0, 0, 0)
is only an almost calabiyau 3-fold, so (j0, 0, 0) is not necessarily
isomorphic to (j, , ) at x, but only to (j, , f ) for some f > 0.

one could instead choose the 0 to be holomorphic coordinates, with
0(j0) = j and 0(0) = . but then the best we could hope for
would be 0(0)  f  and 0(n0)  l0  b.

 the assumptions that n0 is embedded and h1(n0, r) = {0} are to
simplify the calculations involving (relative) homology and cohomology
below, and because we will eventually only be interested in special
lagrangian homology 3-spheres n, which have h1(n, r) = {0}. the
assumptions can be removed without great diculty.

suppose condition 4.1 holds. dene p = n0 \ 0(b). then p is a
compact, nonsingular 3-manifold whose boundary is the image under 0 of
the intersection of l0 with the sphere s5
 is
the orbit of 31/2(1, 1, 1) under the action of g = u(1)2 dened in (7). so
dene  : g  p by

 in c3 of radius . now l0  s5

ei1, 13

ei2, 13

ei1i2(cid:1).

(13)

then  is a dieomorphism g  p .

lemma 4.2 the inclusion  : g  p induces a map  : h1(g, z) 
h1(p, z), which has ker() = z.

proof. as h1(g, z) = z2 and ker() is a subgroup of h1(g, z), we see that
ker() is isomorphic to 0, z or z2. but using poincare duality ideas for
manifolds with boundary, we can show that the map h1(g, r)  h1(p, r)
must have image and kernel r, and this forces ker() = z.
(cid:3)

14

using poincare duality for p and h1(n0, r) = {0} one can also show
that h1(p, r) = r and h2(p, r) = {0}. write q0 = n0  0(b). then q0
is a singular 3-manifold with boundary q0 = p = (g). topologically q0
is the cone on p , and is contractible. we shall now dene homology classes
,  and integers k1, k2, k3 which will be important in what follows.
denition 4.3 let   h1(g, z) be a generator for ker() = z. then 
is unique up to sign. now g = u(1)2, so we may identify h1(g, z) = z2
in the obvious way, such that the maps s1  g given by ei 7 (ei, 1) and
ei 7 (1, ei) represent the classes in h1(g, z) identied with (1, 0) and (0, 1)
in z2 respectively. dene k1, k2, k3  z so that   h1(g, z) is identied
with (k1, k2)  z2, and k3 = k1  k2. then k1 + k2 + k3 = 0.

let  be a closed integral 1-chain in p with [ ] = () in h1(p, z).
then [ ] = () = 0 in h1(p, z), so there exists an integral 2-chain 
in p with  =  . also  is a closed integral 1-chain in q0 and q0 is
contractible, so there exists an integral 2-chain  in q0 with  =  . thus
   is an integral 2-chain without boundary in n0  m. dene  =
[  ]  h2(m, r). then  is a homology class in the image of h2(m, z) in
h2(m, r). since h2(p, r) = h2(q0, r) = {0} this  is independent of the
choice of , , and so is unique up to the choice of sign of .

note that as the chain  representing  lies in n0, which is lagrangian
with respect to 0, we have [0]   = 0, where [0]  h 2(m, r) is the kahler
class of 0. in the rest of the section we shall consider separately the cases
 6= 0 and  = 0.

4.2 the case  6= 0: desingularizing n0

let (m, j0, 0, 0), n0 and x be as above. we shall now consider the question
of when n0 is the limit as t  0+ of a family of compact, nonsingular sl
3-folds modelled on la
t near x. in general this cannot happen in the xed
almost calabiyau 3-fold (m, j0, 0, 0). instead we need to suppose  6= 0,
and extend (m, j0, 0, 0) to a smooth family of almost calabiyau 3-folds
(m, jt, t, t) with [t]   = t. here is our conjecture.

conjecture 4.4 let condition 4.1 hold, and k1, k2, k3 and  be as in def-
inition 4.3. suppose  6= 0, and (m, j0, 0, 0) extends to a smooth family

(cid:8)(m, jt, t, t) : t  (, )(cid:9) of almost calabiyau 3-folds for some  > 0,

where [t]   = t.

15

then there do not exist singular sl 3-folds nt in (m, jt, t, t) close to
n0 and of the same topological type for t 6= 0. however, for some small
  (0, ], whenever a = 1, 2, 3, |t| <  and kat > 0 there exists a compact,
nonsingular, embedded sl 3-fold n a
in (m, jt, t, t) with phase eit, which
t
depends smoothly on t, and converges to n0 as t  0 in a suitable sense, and
near x is locally modelled on la

t/ka.

to be more precise, whenever a = 1, 2, 3, 0 < |t| <  and kat > 0, there
t : b  m which depends smoothly on t and converges

exists an embedding a
to 0 as t  0, and satises

(a) (a

t )(n a

t ) = la

t/ka  b;

(b) (a

t )(t) = ; and

(c) (a

t )(jt)  j and (a

t )(t)  fteit for small t, near 0  b, for

some ft > 0.

in the rest of this subsection we shall give a partial proof of this conjecture,
which justies the assertion that nt does not exist for t 6= 0 but that n a
t
should exist when kat > 0, and be locally modelled on la
t/ka, rather than
la
s for some other s > 0. to complete the proof will require essentially the
same analysis needed to solve conjecture 2.13, and so once conjecture 2.13
has been proved, completing the conjecture above should be straightforward.
first, the nonexistence of singular sl 3-folds nt in (m, jt, t, t) for t 6= 0
close to n0, and of the same topological type. suppose such an nt did exist.
then nt is homeomorphic to n0, and as in 4.1 we can construct a closed
integral 2-chain c in nt close to    in n0. then [c] =  in the image of
h2(m, z) in h2(m, r), as  is a discrete object and is unchanged under small
variations. but t|c = 0, as c lies in nt which is lagrangian with respect
to t. hence [t]   = 0, which contradicts the assumptions [t]   = t
and t 6= 0.

suppose that for some small t  (, ) there exists a compact nonsingular
in (m, jt, t, t), which is close to n0 in a suitable sense, and

as la
n a
t can only exist if kat > 0, and then s = t/ka, as we have to prove. the
case t = ka = 0 is excluded by the conjecture, and will be discussed in 4.3.
this concludes our partial proof of conjecture 4.4.

4.3 the case  6= 0: homology 3-spheres

next we prove that the 3-manifolds n a
calculate the size of h1(n a

t above are homology 3-spheres, and

proof. let a = 1, 2 or 3 and t satisfy |t| <  and kat > 0, and let n a

in conjecture 4.4. suppose also that t is small enough that |t| < |ka|2,
to ensure that qa

enough to prove the proposition for suciently small t.

our goal in this paper is to dene an invariant of almost calabiyau 3-
folds by counting special lagrangian homology 3-spheres in some appropriate
way. we can use the ideas above to draw some conclusions about how to do
this. we assume for the moment that conjecture 4.4 is true.

because k1 + k2 + k3 = 0 and the ka are not all zero as  6= 0, at least one
ka is positive, and one negative. but the sl 3-fold n a
t exists for small t > 0
if and only if ka > 0, and for small t < 0 if and only if ka < 0. so, consider
the following three cases:

(a) suppose k1, k2 > 0 and k3 < 0. then n 1

t and n 2

t exists for small t < 0 but n 1

t exist as sl 3-folds for
t , n 2
t

small t > 0 but n 3
do not.

t does not, and n 3

(b) suppose k1 > 0, k2 = 0 and k3 < 0. then n 1

t exists for small t > 0,

n 3

t exists for small t < 0, and n 2

t does not exist for any t 6= 0.

(c) suppose k1 > 0 and k2, k3 < 0. then n 1

t exists for small t > 0, and

n 2

t , n 3

t exist for small t < 0.

these show that as we deform (m, jt, t, t), changing the kahler class [t],
it can happen that two sl homology 3-spheres disappear, and one reappears;
or that one disappears, and another reappears; or that one disappears, and
two reappear.

in particular, this shows that the number of special lagrangian homology
3-spheres in m is not invariant under deformations of (m, j, , ) changing
the kahler class [], even if counted with signs. so, simple counting of sl
homology 3-spheres, even with signs, is probably not the right thing to do.
however, it is easy to see using proposition 4.5 that the sum over sl homol-

ogy 3-spheres n 1

the kind described in conjecture 4.4.

for instance, in case (a) above, for small t > 0 there exist two sl homol-

ogy 3-spheres n of the weight (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) is unchanged under transitions of
t , z)(cid:12)(cid:12) =
t , z)(cid:12)(cid:12) = k1(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n0, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) and (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n 2
k2(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n0, z)(cid:12)(cid:12), and when t < 0 there is one sl homology 3-spheres n 3
t , z)(cid:12)(cid:12) = k3(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n0, z)(cid:12)(cid:12). but as k3 = k1 + k2 we see that
with (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n 3
t , z)(cid:12)(cid:12), so the sum of weights is the same
(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n 1

t , with (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n 1
t , z)(cid:12)(cid:12) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n 3

t , z)(cid:12)(cid:12) +(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n 2

t , n 2

t

19

for small t > 0 and t < 0. this suggests that the appropriate thing to do

is to count sl homology 3-spheres n with weight (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12), and we will

argue this in 7.

we can now discuss the existence of sl 3-folds n a

t when ka = t = 0,
which was passed over in 4.2. the argument of 4.2 shows that for an sl
3-fold n a
t to exist in (m, jt, t, t) that is modelled on n0 away from x and
la
s near x, we need t = kas. thus, if ka = 0 then such sl 3-folds can only
exist when t = 0. the argument above gives an exact sequence

z = h1(qa

t , z)  h1(n a

t , z)  h1(n0, z)  0,

t , z) has order |ka| in h1(n a

and shows that the generator of h1(qa
t , z). how-
ever, in this case ka = 0, so the map z  h1(n a
t , z) is injective. it follows
that h1(n a
t , z) is innite, the product of z with a nite group, and hence
t ) = 1. so n a
that b1(n a
is not a homology 3-sphere, and by theorem 2.7 it
t
is not isolated as an sl 3-fold, but occurs in a moduli space of dimension 1.
thus we are led to the following picture. if ka > 0 then there exists a
in (m, jt, t, t) for small t > 0. if ka < 0 then there
t in (m, jt, t, t) for small t > 0. and if ka = 0
0 in (m, j0, 0, 0)
s. so in each case the sl 3-folds are indexed by a small

unique sl 3-fold n a
t
exists a unique sl 3-fold n a
then for each small s > 0 there exists a unique sl 3-fold n a
modelled near x on la
positive parameter.

4.4 the case  = 0: stable sl singularities

in 3.2 we argued that sl singularities modelled on the sl cone l0 in c3 are
of index one, and should occur in codimension one in families of sl 3-folds
in generic families of almost calabiyau 3-folds. however, such local calcu-
lations of the index of singularities can sometimes give the wrong answer in
cases when global topological restrictions come into play. this happens when
 = 0 in the situation of 4.1, and eectively the index of the singularities
should be zero rather than one in this case.

let (cid:8)(m, jt, t, t) : t  (, )(cid:9) be a smooth family of almost calabi

yau 3-folds deforming (m, j0, 0, 0). as  = 0, we cannot assume that
[t]   = t, so the family is essentially arbitrary. the argument in 4.2 that
there do not exists singular sl 3-folds nt in (m, jt, t, t) for t 6= 0 close to
n0, and of the same topological type, is now no longer valid, and the author
conjectures that such nt do exist for small t.

20

what about the existence of nonsingular sl 3-folds resolving n0? the
argument in 4.2 shows that if for small t there exists a nonsingular sl 3-fold
n a
s,t in (m, jt, t, t) close to n0 away from x and modelled on la
s near x,
then kas = [t] = 0. as s > 0, this shows that such sl 3-folds n a
s,t cannot
exist unless ka = 0. when ka = 0 such n a
s,t) = 1
as in 4.3, so they should occur in 1-parameter families in (m, jt, t, t) by
theorem 2.7, parametrized by s.

s,t can exist, and have b1(n a

we summarize our conclusions in the following conjecture, which should

be provable by the same methods as conjecture 4.4.

conjecture 4.6 let condition 4.1 hold, and k1, k2, k3 and  be as in def-
inition 4.3. suppose  = 0, and (m, j0, 0, 0) extends to a smooth family

(cid:8)(m, jt, t, t) : t  (, )(cid:9) of almost calabiyau 3-folds for some  > 0.

then for some   (0, ], n0 extends to a smooth family of compact, embed-
ded, singular sl 3-folds nt in (m, jt, t, t) for t  (, ), each of which
has one singular point locally modelled on l0.

if ka = 0 then for small t  (, ) and s > 0 there exists a unique
s,t in (m, jt, t, t) close to n0 away from

compact, nonsingular sl 3-fold n a
x, and modelled on la

s near x. if ka 6= 0 there do not exist any such n a

s,t.

5 another model degeneration of sl 3-folds

we now describe a family of explicit sl 3-folds k,a in c3. this family was
rst found by lawlor [13], was made more explicit by harvey [4, p. 139140],
and was discussed from a dierent point of view by the author in [7, 5.4(b)].
our treatment is based on that of harvey.

our next result comes from harvey [4, th. 7.78].

proposition 5.1 the set k,a dened in (14) is an embedded sl 3-fold in
c3 dieomorphic to s2  r. it is asymptotically conical, with cone the union
0   of two special lagrangian 3-planes 0,  given by

0 = (cid:8)(x1, x2, x3) : xj  r(cid:9),  = (cid:8)(ei1x1, ei2x2, ei3x3) : xj  r(cid:9). (15)

here is how to interpret the constant a. using the above notation, dene

1 + a2x2

d,a = (cid:8)(x1ei1/2, x2ei2/2, x3ei3/2) : xk  r, a1x2
then d,a is a solid ellipsoid in c3, with boundary in k,a. the axes of
d,a have lengths a1/2
for k = 1, 2, 3, and so the volume of d,a is a.
furthermore, d,a is calibrated with respect to im(0). that is, we can
regard d,a as an sl 3-fold of phase i, whereas k,a has phase 1; so that
d,a and k,a are both special lagrangian, but of perpendicular phase.

we met a similar situation in 3. there we dened an ac sl 3-fold

boundary on la
t , and area t. here we dene an ac sl 3-fold k,a depending
on a real parameter a > 0, and a special lagrangian 3-disc d,a of phase i,
with boundary on k,a and area a.

next we apply the ideas of 2.3 to 0   and the k,a.

22

lemma 5.2 in the notation of 2.3, 0   and k,a satisfy k = 2,
b1(k,a) = 0 and l-ind(k,a) = 6, and 0   is rigid.

proof. as 0   is a cone on two disjoint copies of s2 we have k = 1, and
as k,a is dieomorphic to s2  r we have b1(k,a) = 0. there are two
connected components 1, 2 of , each of which is isometric to the unit
sphere s2 in r3 with the round metric.

for both 1, 2 the only eigenvalue of  in (0, 6) is 2, with multiplic-
ity 3, and eigenvectors the restriction to s2 of linear functions on r3. so
l-ind(k,a) = 3 + 3 = 6. similarly,  has eigenvalue 6 with multiplicity 5 on
each of 1, 2, and eigenfunctions the restrictions to s2 of harmonic homo-
geneous quadratic polynomials on r3. as dim su(3) = 8 and the subgroup
gj of su(3) preserving j is isomorphic to so(3) with dimension 3, we see
that 0   is rigid as 5 = 8  3.
(cid:3)

assuming conjecture 2.13, we see that in the sense discussed in 2.3,
singularities of sl 3-folds modelled on the sl cones 0   should have
index one. that is, they should occur in codimension 1 in families of sl
3-folds in a generic almost calabiyau 3-fold, or more generally in generic
families of almost calabiyau 3-folds.

now 0   may be regarded as a singular sl cone in c3 with iso-
lated singular point at 0, but it is also the union of two nonsingular special
lagrangian 3-planes. in the same way, an embedded singular sl 3-fold n
in (m, j, , ) with one singular point x modelled on 0   is either a
nonsingular immersed sl 3-fold with one self-intersection point at x, or the
union of two nonsingular sl 3-folds n +, n which intersect at x, and have
the same phase. we shall study this second possibility.

6 topological behaviour of these singularities

we shall study the following situation.

condition 6.1 let  > 0, and (cid:8)(m, jt, t, t) : t  (, )(cid:9) be a smooth
family of almost calabiyau 3-folds with the same underlying 6-manifold
m. suppose that n +
0 and n0 are compact, embedded, nonsingular special
lagrangian homology 3-spheres in (m, j0, 0, 0) with the same phase ei,
which intersect transversely at one point x, such that the intersection n +
0 
n0
is positive in the sense of homology, using the natural orientations on
n0 and m.

23

we can show using the results of 2.2 that n0 extend to families of sl

3-folds nt

in (m, jt, t, t).

0 and n0 extend to unique smooth families (cid:8)nt

proposition 6.2 suppose condition 6.1 holds. then there exists   (0, ]
such that n +
: t  (, )(cid:9)
of compact, nonsingular, embedded sl 3-folds in (m, jt, t, t). each nt
is
dieomorphic to n0 and homologous to it in h3(m, z), and n +
t and nt
t nt
intersect transversely in one point, where the intersection n +
is positive
in the sense of homology.

0

proof. as n0 are homology 3-spheres we have h 2(n0 , r) = 0, so the condi-
] = 0 in h 2(n0 , r) in theorem 2.8 holds automatically. thus, it
tion [t|n 
follows from theorem 2.8 that for some   (0, ] we can extend n0 to smooth
families nt of compact, nonsingular, embedded sl 3-folds in (m, jt, t, t)
for t  (, ). as these are smooth, connected families the nt are clearly
dieomorphic and homologous to n0 .

now b1(nt ) = b1(n0 ) = 0 as n0 is a homology 3-sphere, so nt

is rigid
by theorem 2.7, that is, it has no special lagrangian deformations. thus
the families nt are unique. to intersect transversely in one point is an open
condition on pairs of submanifolds, so by making  smaller if necessary we
can suppose that n +
intersect transversely in one point, which will
be a positive intersection as [n +
t ]  [nt ] = [n +
(cid:3)

0 ]  [n0 ] = 1.

t and nt

we shall use the following notation.

6.2. dene  = [n0 ] in h3(m, z). then [nt ] =  for t  (, ). let
the phase of nt be ei
is only dened modulo 2z, but we x
it uniquely by requiring that 0 =  and t should depend smoothly on t.
applying lemma 2.6 to nt we see that
[t]   = rt ei

uniquely by requiring that it depend smoothly on t, and 0 = . it is then
easy to show that t lies between +

for all t  (, ).

t and t

one can show using a simultaneous diagonalization argument that if
+,  are sl 3-planes with phase 1 in c3 intersecting only at 0 then there
exists b  su(3) such that b+ = 0 and b = , where
0 = (cid:8)(x1, x2, x3) : xj  r(cid:9) and  = (cid:8)(ei1x1, ei2x2, ei3x3) : xj  r(cid:9)
for some 1, 2, 3  (0, ), where 1 + 2 + 3 =  if +   is a positive
intersection in the sense of homology, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 2 if +   is a
negative intersection. using this it is easy to prove:

proposition 6.4 suppose condition 6.1 holds. then there exists a complex
linear isometry  : c3  txm satisfying

(0) = eidz1  dz2  dz3,

(txn +

0 ) = 0

and (txn0 ) = ,

(20)

where 1, 2, 3  (0, ) with 1+2+3 = , and 0,  are given in (15).

this shows that after adjusting the phase by ei, the singular sl 3-fold
n +
0  n0 is modelled on the sl cone 0   in c3 considered in 5. thus,
it is natural to consider whether there exist compact, nonsingular sl 3-folds
0  n0 away from x, and on k,a near
nt in (m, jt, t, t) modelled on n +
x for small t  (, ) and a > 0. here is our conjectural answer to this
question.

conjecture 6.5 in the situation of condition 6.1, with the notation dened
above, for each small t  (, ) with +
there exists a unique compact,
nonsingular special lagrangian 3-fold nt in (m, jt, t, t) modelled on n +
0 
n0 away from x, and on k,a near x, where a > 0 is small, depends on t,
and is given approximately by

t > t

t  t) = rt sin(t  t ).
furthermore, nt is dieomorphic to the connected sum n +

t sin(+

25

in the rest of the section we will give a partial proof of this conjecture,
justifying the assertion that nt should exist only if +
t > t , the approximate
value of a in (21), and the topological claims about nt. we begin with the
topology. if the sl 3-fold nt exists then it is modelled on n +
0 n0 away from
x, and on k,a near x. but k,a is a narrow neck dieomorphic to s2  r.
0 and
n0 , and joining them together with a small s2  r neck. that is, nt is
0 and n0 . it follows that nt is a homology
0 #n0 of n +
the connected sum n +
3-sphere, and h1(nt, z) = h1(n +
t , z)  h1(nt , z), so that |h1(nt, z)| =
|h1(n +

thus, topologically nt is made by removing the point x from n +

t , z)|  |h1(nt , z)|.

therefore b1(nt) = 0, and hence by theorem 2.7 nt is rigid, so that if
it exists it should be unique. (this is not a rigorous argument). it is also
obvious that nt is homologous to n +
0 ] + [n0 ] =
+ +  in h3(m, z). equation (19) then gives [t]  [nt] = rteit. so by
lemma 2.6 the phase of nt is eit.

0  n0 , and so [nt] = [n +

now if nt has phase eit and is modelled on k,a near x, in a similar way
to conjecture 4.4 we expect that for some small  > 0 there should exist
local coordinates t : b  m near x satisfying the conditions

(a) t (nt)  k,a  b;

(b) t (t)  ft near 0  b for some ft > 0; and

(c) t (jt) = j and t (t) = eit.

here we have chosen our coordinate system to be holomorphic and to iden-
tify t with eit, which means we can only assume that t (nt)  k,a
and t (t)  ft.

equation (16) dened a special lagrangian ellipsoid d,a in c3 with
phase i and boundary in k,a. as t (nt)  k,a  b there exists a disc
dt in c3 close to d,a with dt  t (nt). as dt is close to d,a we have

zdt

im   zd,a

im  = a,

(22)

as d,a is calibrated with respect to im  and has area a.

now nt \ t(dt) has two connected components, say p t , where p +
t
is close to n +
t are compact, oriented 3-
manifolds with boundary. careful consideration of the orientations of nt

to n0 . the closures p 

0 and p t

26

and dt shows that as 3-chains in m we have
and (p 

+
t ) = t(dt)

(p

t ) = t(dt).

therefore p 
denes a homology class in h3(m, z). but clearly p 
to n0 , and so [p 

t  t(dt) is an integral 3-chain in m without boundary, and so
t t(dt) is homologous

t  t(dt)] = .

consider the integral of the 3-form im(eitt) over p 

t  t(dt). since
nt is special lagrangian of phase eit, this form vanishes on nt and p t . thus

im(cid:0)eit[t]  (cid:1) = zt(dt)

im(eitt) = zdt

im()  a,

using part (c) above and equation (22). therefore

a  im(cid:0)eit[t]  +(cid:1) =  im(cid:0)eit[t]  (cid:1).

substituting in equation (17) yields (21), as we have to prove.

now |+

t > t then +

t and t . using these
t  t | <  by (18), and t lies in between +
one can show that if +
t  t and t  t
lie in (0, ) and the
(approximate) value for a in (21) is positive, but if +
t  t
and t  t
lie in (, 0] and the (approximate) value for a is nonpositive.
thus, +
t > t corresponds to the condition that a > 0, which is part of
the denition of k,a, and justies our claim that +
t > t should be the
necessary and sucient condition for the existence of nt for small t. this
completes our partial proof of conjecture 6.5.

t  t then +

note that adrian butscher [1] has proved an analytic result closely related
to conjecture 6.5, but for sl m-folds in cm satisfying certain boundary
conditions rather than for compact sl m-folds in almost calabiyau m-folds.
it seems likely that his analysis can be extended to prove our conjecture.

7 counting sl homology 3-spheres

the gromovwitten invariants of a symplectic manifold (m, ) are dened
by counting, with signs, the j-holomorphic curves in m satisfying certain ho-
mological conditions. a good introduction to the subject is given by mcdu
and salamon [14]. one important feature of these invariants is that they are
very stable under deformations of the choice of almost complex structure j
used to dene them.

27

now it seems a natural (but perhaps optimistic) question to ask whether
we can dene similar invariants of almost calabiyau 3-folds (m, j, , )
by counting sl 3-folds n in m satisfying suitable homological conditions.
probably the simplest such condition is to count 3-folds n in some xed ho-
mology class in h3(n, z), and we will focus on this. we shall also restrict our
attention to (rational) homology 3-spheres, to get zero-dimensional moduli
spaces.

thus we aim to dene an invariant as follows. let (m, j, , ) be a
almost calabiyau 3-fold, let   h3(m, z), and let s() be the set of
special lagrangian homology 3-spheres n in m with [n] = . suppose s()
is nite, and dene

i() = xns()

w(n),

(23)

where w is a weight function taking values in a commutative ring r, and
w(n) depends only on the topology of n.
in this way we dene a map
i : h3(m, z)  r, which we consider to be an analogue of the gromov
witten invariants. for this invariant to be interesting, we would like it to
be stable under deformations of the underlying almost calabiyau 3-fold
(m, j, , ), or at least to change in a predictable way as we make these
deformations.

therefore we need to know what can happen to special lagrangian ho-
mology 3-spheres as we deform (m, j, , ), and especially how they can
become singular, appear or disappear. each such transition may change the
set of special lagrangian homology 3-spheres, and thus the invariant i().
for i() to be invariant or to transform nicely under these transitions, the
weight function w must satisfy some topological identities.

we have already described models for two such transitions in 4 and 6.
we will calculate the conditions on w for i() to be invariant under the change
described in 4, and to transform in a certain simple way under the change

described in 6. it turns out that the weight function w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12)

satises both of these conditions.

we also propose corrections to (23) to include multiple covers of special
lagrangian homology 3-spheres and special lagrangian 3-folds with stable
singularities. we summarize our conclusions in conjecture 7.3, and then
discuss the connections between our invariants and string theory.

28

7.1

invariance of i() under the transitions of 4

in 4.24.3 we explained how, as we deform an almost calabiyau 3-fold
(m, jt, t, t) in a 1-parameter family, three sl 3-folds n 1
t can con-
verge to the same singular sl 3-fold n0 with a t 2-cone singularity. this
happens on a hyperplane [t]   = 0 in the kahler cone, and n a
t exists as
a nonsingular sl 3-fold in (m, j, , ) if either ka > 0 and [t]   > 0, or
ka < 0 and [t]   < 0. it is easy to see that the condition for the invariant
i() given by (23) to be unchanged by this transition is

t , n 3

t , n 2

xa{1,2,3}:ka>0

w(n a

t ) = xa{1,2,3}:ka<0

w(n a

t ).

(24)

now if n is a homology 3-sphere then h1(n, z) is a nite group, so

(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) is a positive integer. take the commutative ring r to be z,
and dene w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12). remarkably, it turns out that this weight

function, perhaps the simplest nontrivial invariant of n there is, satises (24).

proposition 7.1 dene an integer-valued invariant w of compact, non-

singular 3-manifolds n by w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) if h1(n, z) is nite, and

w(n) = 0 if h1(n, z) is innite. then (24) holds for all sets of 3-manifolds
n 1

t constructed as in 4.2.

t , n 2

t , n 3

the proof follows quickly from the material of 4.

7.2 transformation of i() under the transitions of 6

we shall use the following notation.

denition 7.2 let m be a compact 6-manifold, and suppose +,  
h3(m, z) are linearly independent over r. dene a subset w (+, ) in
h 3(m, c) by

w (+, ) = (cid:8)  h 3(m, c) : (  +)(   )  (0, )(cid:9).

(25)

then w (+, ) is a real hypersurface in h 3(m, c), but not a hyperplane.
let   h 3(m, c), and write (  +)(   ) = rei, where r  0 and
  (, ]. then   w (+, ) if r > 0 and  = 0. let  > 0 be small.
we say that  lies on the positive side of w (+, ) if r > 0 and   (0, ),
and on the negative side of w (+, ) if r > 0 and   (, 0).

29

t  nt

section 6 studied a family of almost calabiyau 3-folds (m, jt, t, t)
containing sl homology 3-spheres nt , with [nt ] =  in h3(m, z), such
that n +
is a transverse intersection at a single point, and positive
in the notation above, the phases ei
t of nt are equal ex-
in homology.
actly when [t]  w (+, ), and conjecture 6.1 says that as [t] passes
through w (+, ) from the negative to the positive side, a new sl 3-fold
nt dieomorphic to n +

is created, with [nt] = + + .

t #nt

clearly, nt contributes w(nt) 6= 0 to the invariant i(+ + ) dened
in (23). therefore, i(+ + ) will take dierent values on the positive
and negative sides of w (+, ). so, i() will not be unchanged under
deformations of the almost calabiyau structure (j, , ) on m which change
[] in h 3(m, c). instead, we hope to arrange for i() to transform according
to some rules involving [] and the values i() for other  in h3(m, z).

to see what the simplest of these rules should be, let us generalize the
situation of 6, and suppose that [t] lies on the negative side of w (+, )
for t  (, 0), on w (+, ) for t = 0, and on the positive side of w (+, )
for t  (0, ), but that n +
0 and n0
intersect transversely at k + l points
x1, . . . , xk and y1, . . . , yl, where n +
is positive at xj and negative at
yj, in the sense of homology.

0  n0

then arguing as in 6, we nd that for small t  (0, ) we expect k
0 #n0 ,
distinct, immersed sl homology 3-spheres nt dieomorphic to n +
the connected sums of n +
0 and n0 at x1, . . . , xk, and for small t  (, 0)
we expect l distinct, immersed sl homology 3-spheres nt dieomorphic to
n +

0 #n0 , the connected sums of n +

0 and n0 at y1, . . . , yl.

hence, as [t] passes through w (+, ) going from the negative to the
positive side, we simultaneously create k and destroy l immersed special
0 #n0 . suppose for simplicity that n0 are the only
lagrangian copies of n +
sl homology 3-spheres in their homology classes . then i(+) = w(n +
0 )
and i() = w(n0 ). write i(+ + )+ for the value of i(+ + ) at some
point on the positive side of w (+, ), and i(+ + ) for its value at a
nearby point on the negative side. then we have

i(+ + )+  i(+ + ) = (k  l)  w(n +

0 #n0 ).

(26)

if the weight function w satises the identity

w(n +

0 #n0 ) = w(n +

0 )  w(n0 )

for all homology 3-spheres n0 ,

(27)

30

where multiplication is in the commutative ring r, then (26) can be written

i(+ + )+  i(+ + ) = (+  )  i(+)  i(),

(28)

0 )  w(n0 ) = i(+)  i().
as +   = k  l and w(n +
because of the bilinearity of the r.h.s. of (28) in i(+) and i(), it is easy
to see that (28) should also hold when there are nitely many sl homology
3-spheres in , and not just one in each.

0 #n0 ) = w(n +

thus, (28) gives a formula for how we expect i(+ + ) to change as we
pass through the hypersurface w (+, ). the important thing about this
formula is that the values of i on the positive side of w (+, ) determine
the values of i on the negative side, and vice versa. so although i is not
invariant under deformations of (m, j, , ) which alter the cohomology class
[], it transforms in a completely determined way, and that is more or less
as useful.

in 7.1 we proposed the weight function w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12), for n a

0 , z)h1(n0 , z) as nite

0 #n0 , z) = h1(n +

homology 3-sphere. now h1(n +
groups, and so

(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n +

0 #n0 , z)(cid:12)(cid:12) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n +

0 , z)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n0 , z)(cid:12)(cid:12)

when n0 are homology 3-spheres. thus this weight function w satises (27),
as we wish.

7.3

including multiple covers

let n be an embedded sl homology 3-sphere in an almost calabiyau 3-fold
(m, j, , ) with [n] =   h3(m, z), and  : n  n be a nite cover of
n of degree d > 1, and covering group g, so that |g| = d. suppose n is also
a homology 3-sphere. then we can regard n as an immersed sl homology
3-sphere in m, with [n] = d[n] = d in h3(m, z). what contribution
should n make to i(d)?

we claim that n should contribute w(n)/d to i(d), where w is the
weight function for embedded homology 3-spheres. note that if w takes
values in z, then w(n)/d takes values in q, so that our invariant i(d)
will be actually be a rational number. here is why. let n be another
sl homology 3-sphere in m intersecting n transversely at one point, with
n  n positive. let [n] =  in h3(m, z). deform (m, j, , ) so that
[] passes through w (, ) going from the negative to the positive side.

31

since [n]  [n] = d in homology, we expect from 7.2 to create d distinct
new sl homology 3-spheres as we pass through w (, ), all dieomorphic
to n#n.

however, a little thought shows that we actually create only one sl copy
of n#n. eectively this is because the internal symmetry group g of n
with |g| = d identies the d copies of n#n, so that they all give the
same sl 3-fold. in order for (28) to give the correct transformation law for
i(d + ) across w (, ), we must give n the weight w(n)/d rather
than w(n).

7.4

including sl 3-folds with stable singularities

in 4.4 we described a class of sl 3-folds with stable singularities. that is,
in an almost calabiyau 3-fold (m, j, , ) one can have sl 3-folds n with
one or more t 2-cone singularities, that persist under small deformations of
(j, , ). should such singular sl 3-folds also be counted in the invariant
i(), with some appropriate topological weight?

i believe that the answer to this is yes. furthermore, if the weight for
nonsingular sl 3-folds n is w(n) = |h1(n, z)|, then the weight for singular
sl 3-folds may in some circumstances be negative. i have not yet sorted all
the details of this out, and hope to do so in a future paper. however, here
are the ideas which lead me to this conclusion.

in 34 and 56 we described two kinds of index one singularity of
sl 3-folds, and analysed their topological eects. now i know of at least
two other kinds of index one singularity, the rst locally modelled on the
sl 3-folds of [7, ex. 7.4], and the second on the singularities described in [8,
6]. the topological eects are complicated to describe.

my calculations indicate that one thing that can happen with the rst
kind of index one singularity, is that one can simultaneously create, out of
nothing, a nonsingular, immersed sl homology 3-sphere n0 with one point of
self-intersection x, and an embedded, singular sl 3-fold n1 with one t 2-cone
singularity y, of the kind considered in 4.4, and with ka = 0 for some a =
1, 2, 3.

in fact, we also create a family of nonsingular, embedded, dieomorphic
sl 3-folds nt for t  (0, 1) with b1(nt) = 1, which converge to n0 as t  0+
with local model k,a near x, where a  0+ as t  0+, and converge to n1
as t  1 with local model la
s near y, where s  0+ as t  1. then nt
for t  [0, 1] all have the same homology class [nt] =   h3(m, z).

32

now when it exists, n0 contributes w(n0) to i().

in order for the
invariant i to be unchanged under this kind of transition we need n1 to
contribute w(n0) to i(). it can be shown that h1(n0, z) = h1(n1, z).
thus, if the weight for n0 is w(n0) = |h1(n0, z)|, as above, then the correct
weight for n1 is w(n1) = |h1(n1, z)|.

so i conjecture that for sl 3-folds n with one stable t 2-cone singularity
of the kind considered in 4.4 and ka = 0 for some a = 1, 2, 3, the appropriate
weight is w(n) = |h1(n, z)|. i am not yet sure of the answer when the ka
are all nonzero, or there is more than one t 2-cone singularity.

7.5 a preliminary conjecture

i am now ready to formulate a rst guess as to how to dene an invariant
counting special lagrangian homology 3-spheres, and what its properties
should be under deformations of the underlying almost calabiyau 3-fold.

conjecture 7.3 let (m, j, , ) be a generic almost calabiyau 3-fold.
then there exists i : h3(m, z)  q with the following properties:

(a) for each   h3(m, z), let s() be the set of compact, immersed,
possibly singular sl 3-folds n in m, with [n] =  and b1(n) = 0.
then s() is nite, and

i() = xns()

w(n),

(29)

where w(n)  q is a weight function depending only on the topology
of n and its immersion in m.

(b) let n be a nonsingular immersed sl 3-fold in m. regard n as a
nonsingular, compact 3-manifold with immersion  : n  m. dene
g(n) to be the group of dieomorphisms  : n  n with    = .
then g(n) is nite, and the weight w(n) is

w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(cid:12)(cid:12)g(n)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(30)

(c) i is unchanged by continuous deformations of (m, j, , ) that change
[] but leave [] xed, or multiply [] by a nonzero complex number.
thus i depends only on the complex structure j on m, and not on the
metric g.

33

(d) when we deform (m, j, , ) so that [] passes through one of the
hypersurfaces w (+, ) in h 3(m, c) given in denition 7.2, the in-
variant i transforms according to a set of rules that we are not yet able
to write down.
one of these rules should be that if + and  are primitive elements
of h3(m, z) and i(+ + ) are the values of i(+ + ) at two
nearby points on the positive and negative sides of w (+, ), then

i(+ + )+  i(+ + ) = (+  )  i(+)  i().

(31)

here are some remarks on this conjecture. firstly, in dening gromov
witten invariants, j-holomorphic curves are counted with signs. but i believe
that there is no corresponding way to dene the sign of an sl 3-fold, and
that sl 3-folds should be counted without signs.

secondly, one eect of assuming that (m, j, , ) is generic is that the
only sl 3-folds that can exist in m are those with stable singularities. so
there is no need to restrict to sl 3-folds with stable singularities in den-
ing s().

thirdly, to understand how i() transforms under deformations, it is

enough to consider smooth 1-parameter families (cid:8)(m, jt, t, t) : t  [0, 1](cid:9)

of almost calabiyau 3-folds, where (m, j0, 0, 0) and (m, j1, 1, 1) are
generic (so that the invariant i is dened when t = 0 or 1) and the family
itself is generic as a 1-parameter family.

now by the ideas of 2.3, the only singularities of sl 3-folds n with
b1(n) = 0 that we will encounter in such families of almost calabiyau 3-
folds are singularities with index one. thus, provided the general picture of
2.3 is correct, to prove conjecture 7.3 we only need to know about special
lagrangian singularities with index one, and higher codimension singularities
can be ignored.

fourthly, in part (d) we have not given a complete set of rules for the
transformation of i on the hypersurfaces w (+, ). here is why. when
we pass through the hypersurface w (+, ) we expect to create or destroy
new sl 3-folds with homology class + + , which are connected sums of
3-folds with homology classes + and . but this is only the simplest kind
of transition which happens on w (+, ).

34

1 , n +

1 #n#n +

for instance, if n +

2  s(+) and n  s(), then on w (+, )
we may create a new sl homology 3-sphere with homology class 2+ + ,
dieomorphic to the triple connected sum n +
2 . so there should
be some change to i(2+ + ) on w (+, ). similarly, if a, b are positive
integers then we can try and take a multiple connected sum of a elements
of s(+) and b elements of s() to get a new sl homology 3-sphere with
homology class a+ + b.

however, there is a problem: can we include an sl 3-fold in such a
connected sum more than once, and if so, how? the answer to this appears
to be rather complex, and i do not yet understand it, which is why im not
ready to write down a full set of transformation rules for i.

7.6 relationships with string theory

i now want to argue that the invariant i postulated above should have an
interpretation in string theory, and may t into a piece of the mirror sym-
metry story for calabiyau 3-folds which is not understood at present. there
are two main reasons for this:

(a) the invariant i counts objects which are signicant in string theory,

namely isolated 3-branes; and

(b) mirror symmetry strongly suggests that for a calabiyau 3-fold x
there should be discrete, q-valued invariants dened on h3(x, z) or
something like it, which are related under the mirror transform to the
gromovwitten invariants of the mirror manifold y . but no such
invariants are known at present.

we rst discuss reason (a).

in string theory, sl 3-folds correspond
roughly to physical objects called 3-branes. but a 3-brane is not just a
3-dimensional submanifold n; it also carries with it a complex line bundle
over n with a at u(1)-connection. (for a discussion of this, see for instance
strominger, yau and zaslow [16].) we will call a 3-brane isolated if it admits
no deformations, which happens when n is a rational homology 3-sphere.

if n is a compact 3-manifold, then at u(1)-connections on n are equiv-
alent to group homomorphisms h1(n, z)  u(1). but when h1(n, z) is
nite, it is easy to show using the theory of nite abelian groups that the
number of group homomorphisms h1(n, z)  u(1) is exactly |h1(n, z)|.
hence, if n is a special lagrangian homology 3-sphere, then there are exactly

35

|h1(n, z)| at u(1)-connections over n, and so n gives rise to |h1(n, z)|
isolated 3-branes.

therefore, for the case of nonsingular, embedded sl 3-folds, the invariant
i() discussed above counts the number of isolated 3-branes in the homology
class . so it is a natural thing to count from the string theory point of
view, although the author formulated conjecture 7.3 without knowing this.
next we discuss reason (b). the following basic outline of mirror sym-
metry in string theory is by now well known, and is described for instance
in greene and plesser [3]. to a pair (x, s), where x is a calabiyau 3-fold
and s some extra structure which we will not worry about, a physicist asso-
ciates a super conformal field theory (scft). there are believed to exist
mirror pairs (x, s) and (y, t ) whose scfts are isomorphic under a simple
involution of the scft structure.

x on h 2,1(x) and i 1,1

if (x, s) and (y, t ) are such a mirror pair, then h 2,1(x) = h 1,1(y ), and
certain cubic forms i 2,1
x has
a simple denition, depending on the variation of complex structures on x.
however, i 1,1
y has a complicated denition, involving an innite sum over
homology classes  in h2(y, z) of the number of rational curves in y with
homology class , multiplied by complex functions of a standard form.

y on h 1,1(y ) agree. here i 2,1

now, here is the important point.

if we accept the mirror conjecture,
then i 2,1
x can be written as essentially the sum of a power series with integer
(or rational) coecients. is there a way of understanding, purely in terms
of x and without introducing the mirror y , why these numbers should be
integers, and what they mean?

the author hopes that this question can be answered as follows. there
should be a way to write i 2,1
x as a sum over nite collections of elements
of h3(x, z) of integer or rational invariants similar to the invariant i de-
scribed in 7.5, multiplied by complex (holomorphic, in a suitable sense)
functions of [] of a standard form. as [] passes through a hypersurface
w (+, ), these complex functions may change discontinuously to compen-
sate for changes in i, so that i 2,1
x remains continuous. the reason the numbers
in the series are integers (or rationals) is then that they count collections of
sl 3-folds satisfying certain conditions.
