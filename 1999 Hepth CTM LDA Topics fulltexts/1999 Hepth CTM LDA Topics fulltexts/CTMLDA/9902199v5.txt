abstract

the two-dimensional chiral anomaly is calculated using dierential regular-
ization.
it is shown that the anomaly emerges naturally in the vector and
axial ward identities on the same footing as the four-dimensional case. the
vector gauge symmetry can be achieved by an appropriate choice of the mass
scales without introducing the seagull term. we have analyzed the reason
why such a universal result can be obtained in dierential regularization.

one of the most remarkable dynamical phenomena in two-dimensional massless quantum
electrodynamics (qed2) is that the photon eld becomes massive through a dynamical
higgs mechanism induced by the fermion [1]. the essence for its occurrence lies in the

spontaneous breaking of the global chiral symmetry u(1)eu (1), u(1) and eu (1) denoting

the abelian group associated with the charge and chirality of the fermion, respectively.
this fact makes qed2 served as a laboratory for understanding the vacuum structure of
qcd4 [2].

the two-dimensional chiral anomaly plays a crucial role in revealing above dynamical
phenomena [3, 4]. in fact, the two-dimensional chiral anomaly was rst found by johnson [5]
prior to the discovery of the famous abj chiral anomaly in four dimensions [6]. later an
explicit perturbative calculation was also carried out in ref. [7].
in the last decade this
anomaly has been re-investigated by various perturbative and non-perturbative calculation
techniques such as dimensional, pauli-villars and zeta function regularization schemes as well
as a dispersion relation approach [8] and topological analysis [9]. recently, it is calculated
again by a quite old method called analytic regularization [10]. however, we think that it
is still worthwhile to use a newly developed quantum eld theory methods to gain insight.
this may not only reveal some of the new features of the two-dimensional anomaly, but also
test the feasibility of the modern computation techniques.

in view of the above considerations, in this letter we shall use a relatively new regular-
ization scheme called dierential regularization [11] to calculate the two-dimensional chiral
anomaly. the basic idea of this regularization is quite simple. it works in coordinate space
for euclidean eld theory and is based on the observation that the higher order amplitude
cannot have a fourier transform into momentum space due to the short-distance singularity.
thus one can regulate such an amplitude by rst writing its singular parts as the deriva-
tives of the less singular functions, which have a well dened fourier transform, and then
performing fourier transformation in partial integration and discarding the surface term.
in this way one can directly get a renormalized result. up to now this method and its
modied version have been applied successfully to almost every eld theories, including the
supersymmetric ones [1116].

the main motivation for us to choose this regularization scheme to study the two-
dimensional chiral anomaly is its great advantage over other regularization schemes in
preserving gauge symmetry. the maintenance of the gauge symmetry in dierential reg-
ularization is achieved by appropriately choosing the indenite renormalization scales at the
nal stage of the calculation. therefore, this regularization method can lead to a most demo-
cratic expression for the chiral anomaly. on the other hand, in pauli-villars, dimensional
and zeta function regularization, a renormalization condition is automatically imposed on
the vector and axial ward identities when calculating the chiral anomaly. that is, these
regularization schemes themselves are compatible with the conservation of vector gauge sym-
metry and violate the axial vector symmetry, thus one can only observe an anomalous axial
vector ward identity. dierential regularization is dierent. the study of four-dimensional
chiral anomaly in terms of dierential regularization was initially carried out in ref. [11]
and [13], and it was shown that the anomalous term can naturally arise in the vwi and
awi on the same footing. furthermore, combined with the conformal symmetry of the
correlate function, as initially proposed by baker and johnson [17], dierential regulariza-
tion was also applied to investigate the possible two-loop radiative correction to the chiral
anomaly and the axial gravitational anomaly [18]. therefore, the investigation of the chiral
anomaly in terms of dierential regularization will denitely be more powerful in revealing
the quantum structure of the theory than other regularization schemes. in addition, dier-
ential regularization does not modify the original lagrangian at all, hence it never shifts the
value of a primitively divergent feynman diagram away from its singularities, and neither
does it extend the dimensionality of the space-time or introduce a regulator [13]. thus
this regularization method is free from the ambiguity in dening the dimensional continu-
ation of 5, which can occur in dimensional regularization. the details of the calculation
in the dierential regularization are also simpler than in pauli-villars and zeta function
regularization.

we now set up the framework for calculating this anomaly. the lagrangian of qed2

with one avour fermion in euclidean space is read as follows [4]:

l = (i/  e/a  m)

ff,

,  = 1, 2,

where the -matrices are chosen as the two-component form

1 = 2, 2 = 1, 5 = i12 = 3.

classically, the following vector and axial currents

(2)

satisfy the relations

j = ,

j5

j = 0, j5

 = 2imj5

with j5 being the pseudo-scalar current, j5 5.

in qed2 the chiral anomaly comes from the two-point function [9]

5

(x  y) = ht [j(x)j5

 (y)]i.

(3)

(4)

(5)

this is contrary to the four-dimensional case, where the chiral anomaly comes from the
triangle composed of the axial and vector currents. due to the explicit relation i5 = ,
t 5
 is relevant to the vacuum polarization tensor

5

(x  y) = (x  y).

(6)

thus 5

 can be calculated via the vacuum polarization tensor.

if the classical symmetries of the theory were preserved at the quantum level there would

exist the following vector ward identity (vwi),

5
x

(x  y) = x

(x  y) = y

 (x  y) = 0

and the corresponding axial vector one (awi),

 5

(x  y) = 2im5

(8)

with that 5
will be violated due to the chiral anomaly.

(x  y)ht [j(x)j5(y)]i. later it can be seen that the above ward identities

for massless qed2, the propagator of the fermion in euclidean space is

s(x) =

/ ln

where and later we denote x|x|; while for the massive case, we have

s(x) =

1
2

(/  m)k0(mx),

(9)

(10)

where k is the modied bessel function of the second kind.

let us rst consider the massless case. with the propagator (9) we write down the

vacuum polarization tensor

(x) = tr [s(x)s(x)] =

x2 ! ,

(11)

where we have used the relation f (x) = x/x[d/dxf (x)] and the two-dimensional -matrix
trace formula tr() = 2 (   + ).

the term with the tensor structure xx can be rewritten as

xx

(12)

upon substitution of (12) into the vacuum polarization tensor (11), it seems that the term
with the tensor structure  could cancel. in fact, this is not allowed since in two dimension
the term  1/x2 is obviously singular. it is analogous to the fact that two divergent terms
with the same form but opposite sign in momentum space cannot be canceled, only after a
regularization procedure is implemented so that they become well dened, the substraction
operation can work safely. otherwise, a nite term will probably lost since the dierence
of two innite quantities is generally not zero. we therefore use dierential regularization
schemes to make 1/x2 well dened. writing

we get

1/4[ln(m 2x2)/x2].

with (12) and (15) the dierential regulated vacuum polarization tensor is obtained

just like the four-dimensional case, the results (16) and (17) have displayed a most

the n = 0 choice just corresponds to the conservation of axial vector current but an anoma-

the massive case can be calculated in a similar way. the vacuum polarization tensor is

(27)

the general choice (18) in eq.(24) will give a democratic expression for the anomalous
ward identities of the massive qed2. in the special n = 2 case, it can be easily checked
that the vwi is satised and the awi becomes anomalous,

(x) = (x) = 5

(28)

where we have made use of the property for the two-dimensional euclidean scalar propagator,

k0(mx) = m2k0(mx)  2(2)(x).

(29)

eqs.(17), (24) and the calculation deriving them show that the origin of the two-
dimensional anomaly in the dierential regularization is the same as in the four-dimensional
case [13]. to regulate two dierent singular pieces, one has to introduce two dierent mass
scales. the terms with these two mass scales actually can combine into a nite amplitude
with a continuous one-parameter shift degree of freedom given by the quotient of these two
scales. this degree of freedom cannot accommodate the vector and axial vector ward identi-
ties simultaneously so that the two-dimensional chiral anomaly has to emerge and manifests
itself in the vector and axial vector ward identities on the same footing.

in summary, we have obtained two-dimensional anomaly neatly in terms of dieren-
tial regularization.
in comparison with other approaches such as dimensional and pauli-
villars regularization, this regularization scheme has clearly exhibited the nature of the
two-dimensional chiral anomaly and especially, the anomaly has manifested itself in the
vector and axial ward identities impartially. furthermore, the impartiality is achieved
automatically in dierential regularization and does not require an explicit particular

6

choice of the renormalization conditions on the physical amplitude as other regularization
schemes [19]. this has not only demonstrate the applicability of dierential regularization
to two-dimensional gauge theory, but also has revealed an intrinsic anomaly structure of the
theory.

another point which should be emphasized is that we have overcome the diculty of the
gauge non-invariance of the two-point function of qed2 in coordinate space. it is known that
the vacuum polarization tensor calculated before in coordinate space is not gauge invariant,
a covariant seagull term has to be added to gain the gauge symmetry [20]. of course, the
reason for this is that the singularity is not properly regulated. here in the framework of
dierential regularization we have achieved the gauge invariance by an appropriate choice
of the undetermined mass scales.

the above result obtained in dierential regularization is not accidental and the pro-
found reason lies in the nice features presented by dierential regularization itself [21] as it
is shown above, the basic operation in dierential regularization is replacing a singular term
by the derivative of another less singular function. this operation has provided a possibility
to add arbitrary local terms into the amplitude. whenever performing such a operation,
we are introducing into a new arbitrary local term into the quantum eective action. for
the issue we are considering, the vacuum polarization tensor in qed2, this arbitrariness is
parameterized by the ratio of the two renormalization scales, m1/m2. in fact, this case is
exactly the phenomenon emphasized by jackiw [22] recently. according to renormalization
theory, the introduction of an arbitrary local term in the amplitude is equivalent to the
addition of a nite counterterm to the lagrangian. therefore, dierential regularization can
yield the most general quantum eective action. in particular, as stated in the introduction,
this local parameterized ambiguity in dierential regularization can be xed at the nal
stage of the calculation by inputing some physical requirements. this special feature of
dierential regularization has formed a sharp contrast to other regularization schemes such
as dimensional, pauli-villars and cut-o regularization etc. these regularization methods,
together with given renormalization prescription, can x the arbitrary local terms automat-
ically. therefore, dierential regularization can give a more universal result than any other
regularization method, since it does not impose any preferred choice on the amplitude at
the beginning of implementing the regularization. this is just the reason why the chiral
anomaly can emerge in both vector and axial vector ward identities on the same footing,
while in dimensional and pauli-villars regularization method, the anomaly only reects in
the axial ward identity since the vector gauge symmetry has already been xed in these
regularization schemes.
