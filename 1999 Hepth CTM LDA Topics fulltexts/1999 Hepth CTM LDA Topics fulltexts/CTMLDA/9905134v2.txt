abstract

in this paper we ll a necessary gap in order to realize the explicit compari-
son between the kaluza klein spectra of supergravity compactied on ads4  x 7
and superconformal eld theories living on the world volume of m2branes. on
the algebraic side we consider the superalgebra osp(n|4) and we study the dou-
ble intepretation of its unitary irreducible representations either as supermultiplets
of particle states in the bulk or as conformal supereld on the boundary. on the
lagrangian eld theory side we construct, using rheonomy rather than supereld
techniques, the generic form of an n = 2, d = 3 gauge theory. indeed the super-
conformal multiplets are supposed to be composite operators in a suitable gauge
theory.

1 introduction

one of the most exciting developments in the recent history of string theory has been the
discovery of the holographic ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:

scft on (adsp+2)  sugra on adsp+2

(1.1)

between a d = p + 1 quantum superconformal eld theory on the boundary of anti de
sitter space and classical kaluza klein supergravity [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17],
[18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] emerging from compactication of either superstrings
or m-theory on the product space

adsp+2  x dp2 ,

where x dp2 is a d  p  2dimensional compact einstein manifold.

the present paper deals with the case:

and studies two issues:

p = 2  d = 3

(1.2)

(1.3)

1. the relation between the description of unitary irreducible representations of the
osp(2|4) superalgebra seen as oshell conformal superelds in d = 3 or as onshell
particle supermultiplets in d = 4 anti de sitter space. such double interpretation of
the same abstract representations is the algebraic core of the ads/cft correspon-
dence.

2. the generic component form of an n = 2 gauge theory in three space-time di-
mensions containing the supermultiplet of an arbitrary gauge group, an arbitrary
number of scalar multiplets in arbitrary representations of the gauge group and with
generic superpotential interactions. this is also an essential item in the discussion of
the ads/cft correspondence since the superconformal eld theory on the bound-
ary is to be identied with a superconformal infrared xed point of a non abelian
gauge theory of such a type.

before presenting our results we put them into perspective through the following intro-
ductory remarks.

1.1 the conceptual environment and our goals

the logical path connecting the two partners in the above correspondence (1.1) starts from
considering a special instance of classical pbrane solution of ddimensional supergravity
characterized by the absence of a dilaton (a = 0 in standard pbrane notations) and by
the following relation:

= 2

(1.4)

between the dimension d  p + 1 of the pbrane world volume and that of its magnetic
dual ed  d  p  3. such a solution is given by the following metric and p + 2 eld

transverse to the brane.

where mp+1 denotes minkowski space in p + 1 dimensions while c(cid:16)x dp2(cid:17) denotes the
d  p  1 dimensional metric cone over the horizon manifold x dp2. the key point is
that (compactied) minkowski space can also be identied with the boundary of anti de
sitter space:

(1.11)
so that we can relate supergravity on adsp+2  x dp2 to the gauge theory of a stack of
pbranes placed in such a way as to have the metric cone as transverse space (see g.1)

 (adsp+2)  mp+1 ,

c(cid:16)x dp2(cid:17) = transverse directions to the branes.

(1.12)

2

figure 1: the metric cone c(cid:16)x dp2(cid:17) is transverse to the stack of branes

according to current lore on brane dynamics [50, 51, 52, 53], if the metric cone
c(x dp2) can be reintepreted as some suitable resolution of an orbifold singularity
[54, 55, 56, 57]:

c(x dp2) = resolution of

rdp1



,

 = discrete group,

(1.13)

then there are means to identify a gauge theory in mp+1 minkowski space with super-
symmetry n determined by the holonomy of the metric cone, whose structure and eld
content in the ultraviolet limit is determined by the orbifold rdp1/. in the infrared
limit, corresponding to the resolution c(x dp2), such a gauge theory has a superconfor-
mal xed point and denes the superconformal eld theory scf tp+1 dual to supergravity
on adsp+2  x dp2.
basic relation (1.4) is satised

in this general conceptual framework there are three main interesting cases where the

p = 3 d = 10 ads5  x 5 d3brane of type iib theory
p = 2 d = 11 ads4  x 7 m2brane of mtheory
p = 5 d = 11 ads7  x 4 m5brane of mtheory

(1.14)

the present paper focuses on the case of m2 branes and on the general features of n = 2
superconformal eld theories in d = 3. indeed the nal goal we are pursuing in a series of
papers is that of determining the threedimensional superconformal eld theories dual to
compactications of d=11 supergravity on ads4  x 7, where the non spherical horizon
x 7 is chosen to be one of the four homogeneous sasakian 7manifolds g/h:

x 7 =



m 1,1,1 = su (3)su (2)u (1)

su (3)

(1.15)

that were classied in the years 1982-1985 [13, 21, 24] when kaluza klein supergravity
was very topical. the sasakian structure [30, 31, 32, 33] of g/h reects its holonomy

3

and is the property that guarantees n = 2 supersymmetry both in the bulk ads4 and
on the boundary m3. kaluza klein spectra for d = 11 supergravity compactied on the
manifolds (1.15) have already been constructed [29] or are under construction [34] and,
once the corresponding superconformal theory has been identied, it can provide a very
important tool for comparison and discussion of the ads/cft correspondence.

1.2 the specic problems addressed and solved in this paper

in the present paper we do not address the question of constructing the algebraic conifolds
dened by the metric cones c(g/h) nor the identication of the corresponding orbifolds.
here we do not discuss the specic construction of the superconformal eld theories as-
sociated with the horizons (1.15) which is postponed to future publications [35]: we
rather consider a more general problem that constitutes an intermediate and essential
step for the comparison between kaluza klein spectra and superconformal eld theories.
as anticipated above, what we need is a general translation vocabulary between the two
descriptions of osp(n|4) as the superisometry algebra in anti de sitter n extended d = 4
superspace and as a superconformal algebra in d = 3. in order to make the comparison
between superconformal eld theories and kaluza klein results explicit, such a transla-
tion vocabulary is particularly essential at the level of unitary irreducible representations
(uir). on the kaluza klein side the uir.s appear as supermultiplets of onshell particle
states characterized by their square mass m2 which, through well established formulae, is
expressed as a quadratic form:

m2 = c (e0  a)(e0  b)

(1.16)

in the energy eigenvalue e0 of a compact so(2) generator, by their spin s with respect to
the compact so(3) little group of their momentum vector and, nally, by a set of so(n )
labels. these particle states live in the bulk of ads4. on the superconformal side the
uir.s appear instead as multiplets of primary conformal operators constructed out of the
fundamental elds of the gauge theory. they are characterized by their conformal weight
d, their so(1, 2) spin j and by the labels of the so(n ) representation they belong
to. actually it is very convenient to regard such multiplets of conformal operators as
appropriate conformally invariant superelds in d = 3 superspace.

given this, what one needs is a general framework to convert data from one language

to the other.

such a programme has been extensively developed in the case of the ads5/cf t4
correspondence between n = 4 yangmills theory in d = 4, seen as a superconformal
theory, and type iib supergravity compactied on ads5  s5. in this case the supercon-
formal algebra is su(2, 2|4) and the relation between the two descriptions of its uir.s
as boundary or bulk supermultiplets was given, in an algebraic setup, by gunaydin and
collaborators [36, 37], while the corresponding supereld description was discussed in a
series of papers by ferrara and collaborators [38, 39, 40, 41].

edge, missing so far. the present paper is meant to ll the gap.

a similar discussion for the case of the osp(n|4) superalgebra was, up to our knowl-
there are relevant structural dierences between the superalgebra g = su(2, 2|n )
and the superalgebra g = osp(n|4) but the basic strategy of papers [36, 37] that consists
of performing a suitable rotation from a basis of eigenstates of the maximal compact
subgroup so(2)  so(p + 1)  g to a basis of eigenstates of the maximal non compact

4

subgroup so(1, 1)  so(1, p)  g can be adapted. after such a rotation we derive the
d = 3 supereld description of the supermultiplets by means of a very simple and powerful
method based on the supersolvable parametrization of anti de sitter superspace [48]. by
denition, anti de sitter superspace is the following supercoset:

ads4|n 

osp(n|4)

so(1, 3)  so(n )

(1.17)

and has 4 bosonic coordinates labeling the points in ads4 and 4n fermionic coordinates
i that transform as majorana spinors under so(1, 3) and as vectors under so(n ).
there are many possible coordinate choices for parametrizing such a manifold, but as far
as the bosonic submanifold is concerned it was shown in [49] that a particularly useful
parametrization is the solvable one where the ads4 coset is regarded as a noncompact
solvable group manifold:

ads4 

so(2, 3)
so(1, 3)

= exp [solvads]

(1.18)

the solvable algebra solvads is spanned by the unique noncompact cartan generator d
belonging to the coset and by three abelian operators pm (m = 0, 1, 2) generating the
translation subalgebra in d = 1 + 2 dimensions. the solvable coordinates are

  d ; zm  pm

(1.19)

and in such coordinates the ads4 metric takes the form (1.9). hence  is interpreted as
measuring the distance from the branestack and zm are interpreted as cartesian coordi-
nates on the brane boundary (ads4). in [48] we addressed the question whether such
a solvable parametrization of ads4 could be extended to a supersolvable parametrization
of anti de sitter supersapce as dened in (1.17). in practice that meant to single out a
solvable superalgebra with 4 bosonic and 4  n fermionic generators. this turned out to
be impossible, yet we easily found a supersolvable algebra ssolvads with 4 bosonic and
2  n fermionic generators whose exponential denes solvable anti de sitter superspace:
(1.20)

ads(solv)

4|2n  exp [ssolvads]

the supermanifold (1.20) is also a supercoset of the same supergroup osp(n|4) but with
respect to a dierent subgroup:

ads(solv)
4|2n

=

osp(4|n )
cso(1, 2|n )

2

(1.21)

bosonic generators

(1.22)

where cso(1, 2|n )  osp(n|4) is an algebra containing 3+3+ n (n1)
and 2  n fermionic ones. this algebra is the semidirect product:
cso(1, 2|n ) = iso(1, 2|n )  so(n )
}

semidirect

{z

of n extended superpoincare algebra in d = 3 (iso(1, 2|n )) with the orthogonal group
so(n ).
it should be clearly distinguished from the central extension of the poincare
superalgebra z [iso(1, 2|n )] which has the same number of generators but dierent
commutation relations.
indeed there are three essential dierences that it is worth to
recall at this point:

|

figure 2: boundary superelds are obtained as limiting values of superelds in the bulk

1. in z [iso(1, 2|n )] the n (n  1)/2 internal generators z ij are abelian, while in

cso(1, 2|n ) the corresponding t ij are non abelian and generate so(n ).

2. in z [iso(1, 2|n )] the supercharges qi commute with z ij (these are in fact central

charges), while in cso(1, 2|n ) they transform as vectors under t ij

3. in z [iso(1, 2|n )] the anticommutator of two supercharges yields, besides the
translation generators pm, also the central charges z ij, while in cso(1, 2|n ) this
is not true.

. being a coset, the solvable adssuperspace ads(solv)
4|2n

we will see the exact structure of cso(1, 2|n )  osp(n|4) and of iso(1, 2|n ) 
cso(1, 2|n ) as soon as we have introduced the full orthosymplectic algebra. in the su-
perconformal interpretation of the osp(n|4) superalgebra, cso(1, 2|n ) is spanned by
the conformal boosts km, the lorentz generators j m and the special conformal super-
symmetries si
supports a non
linear representation of the full osp(n|4) superalgebra. as shown in [48], we can regard
ads(solv)
as ordinary anti de sitter superspace ads4|n where 2n fermionic coordinates
4|2n
have being eliminated by xing supersymmetry.
our strategy to construct the boundary superelds is the following. first we construct
the supermultiplets in the bulk by acting on the abstract states spanning the uir with the
coset representative of the solvable superspace ads(solv)
and then we reach the boundary
4|2n
by performing the limit   0 (see g. 2)
the general structure of the osp(2|4) supermultiplets that may appear in kaluza
klein supergravity has been determined recently in [29] through consideration of a spe-
cic example, that where the manifold x 7 is the sasakian m 1,1,1. performing harmonic
analysis on m 1,1,1 we have found graviton, gravitino and vector multiplets both in a long
and in a shortened version. in addition we have found hypermultiplets that are always
short and the ultra short multiplets corresponding to massless elds. according to our
previous discussion each of these multiplets must correspond to a primary supereld on
the boundary. we determine such superelds with the above described method. short
supermultiplets correspond to constrained superelds. the shortening conditions relat-

6

ing mass and hypercharges are retrieved here as the necessary condition to mantain the
constraints after a superconformal transformation.

as we anticipated above these primary conformal elds are eventually realized as com-
posite operators in a suitable n = 2, d = 3 gauge theory. hence, in the second part of
this paper we construct the general form of such a theory. to this eect, rather than
superspace formalism we employ our favorite rheonomic approach that, at the end of the
day, yields an explicit component form of the lagrangian and the supersymmetry trans-
formation rules for all the physical and auxiliary elds. although supersymmetric gauge
theories in d = 3 dimensions have been discussed in the literature through many examples
(mostly using superspace formalism) a survey of their general form seems to us useful.
keeping track of all the possibilities we construct a supersymmetric oshell lagrangian
that employs all the auxiliary elds and includes, besides minimal gauge couplings and
superpotential interactions also chern simons interactions and fayet iliopoulos terms.
we restrict however the kinetic terms of the gauge elds to be quadratic since we are
interested in microscopic gauge theories and not in eective lagrangians. generalization
of our results to non minimal couplings including arbitrary holomorphic functions of the
scalars in front of the gauge kinetic terms is certainly possible but it is not covered in our
paper.

in particular we present general formulae for the scalar potential and we analyse the
further conditions that an n = 2 gauge theory should satisfy in order to admit either
n = 4 or n = 8 supersymmetry. this is important in connection with the problem
of deriving the ultraviolet orbifold gauge theories associated with the sasakian horizons
(1.15). indeed a possible situation that might be envisaged is that where at the orbifold
point the gauge theory has larger supersymmetry broken to n = 2 by some of the
it is therefore vital to write
perturbations responsible for the singularity resolution.
n = 4 and n = 8 theories in n = 2 language. this is precisely what we do here.

1.3 our paper is organized as follows:

in section 2 we discuss the denition and the general properties of the orthosymplectic
osp(n|4) superalgebra.
in particular we discuss its two vegradings: compact and
non compact, the rst related to the supergravity interpretation , the second to the
superconformal eld theory interpretation.

in section 3 we discuss the supercoset structure of superspace and the realization of
the osp(n|4) superalgebra as an algebra of transformations in two dierent supercosets,
the rst describing the bulk of ads4, the second its boundary (ads4).
in section 4 we come to one of the main points of our paper and focusing on the case
n = 2 we show how to construct boundary conformal superelds out of the kaluza klein
osp(2|4) supermultiplets.
in section 5 we discuss the rheonomic construction of a generic n = 2, d = 3 gauge
theory with arbitrary eld content and arbitrary superpotential interactions.
in section 6 we briey summarize our conclusions.
finally in appendix a the reader can nd the explicit derivation of the killing vectors
generating the action of the osp(n|4) superalgebra on superspace. these killing vectors
are an essential tool for the derivation of our result in section 4

2 the osp(n|4) superalgebra: denition, properties

and notations

the non compact superalgebra osp(n|4) relevant to the ads4/cf t3 correspondence is
a real section of the complex orthosymplectic superalgebra osp(n|4,c) that admits the
lie algebra
(2.1)
as even subalgebra. alternatively, due to the isomorphism sp(4, ir)  usp(2, 2) we can
take a dierent real section of osp(n|4,c) such that the even subalgebra is:

geven = sp(4, ir)  so(n , ir)

geven = usp(2, 2)  so(n , ir)

(2.2)

in this paper we mostly rely on the second formulation (2.2) which is more convenient to
discuss unitary irreducible representations, while in ([48]) we used the rst (2.1) that is
more advantageous for the description of the supermembrane geometry. the two formu-
lations are related by a unitary transformation that, in spinor language, corresponds to
a dierent choice of the gamma matrix representation. formulation (2.1) is obtained in
a majorana representation where all the gamma matrices are real (or purely imaginary),
while formulation (2.2) is related to a dirac representation.

our choice for the gamma matrices in a dirac representation is the following one1:

0 =

0  ! ,

1,2,3 =

matrices a:  1 = 3,  2 = 1 and  3 = 2; for the spin covering of so(1, 2) we choose instead the
matrices  dened in (2.17).

the index conventions we have so far introduced can be summarized as follows.
capital indices a, b = 0, 1, . . . , 4 denote so(2, 3) vectors. the latin indices of type
i, j, k = 1, . . . ,n are so(n ) vector indices. the indices a, b, c, . . . = 1, 2, 3 are used
to denote spatial directions of ads4: ab = diag(,,), while the indices of type
m, n, p, . . . = 0, 1, 2 are space-time indices for the minkowskian boundary  (ads4):
mn = diag(+,,). to write the osp(n|4) algebra in abstract form it suces to
read the graded matrix (2.5) as a linear combination of generators:

(2.9)

where qi = c[4](cid:16)q
i(cid:17)t

as follows:

the form (2.11) of the osp(n|4) superalgebra coincides with that given in papers [16],[17]
and utilized by us in our recent derivation of the m 111 spectrum [29].
in the gamma matrix basis (2.3) the majorana supersymmetry charges have the fol-

lowing form:

qi =(cid:18) ai

ai(cid:19) ,



ai (cid:16)ai

(2.12)

where ai
 are two-component sl(2,c) spinors: , , . . . = 1, 2. we do not use dotted and
undotted indices to denote conjugate sl(2,c) representations; we rather use higher and
lower indices. raising and lowering is performed by means of the -symbol:

in the second part of the paper where we deal with the lagrangian of d = 3 gauge
theories, the conventions for twocomponent spinors are slightly modied to simplify the
notations and avoide the explicit writing of spinor indices. the grassman coordinates of
n =2 three-dimensional superspace introduced in equation (4.2) ,  , are renamed  and
c. the reason for the superscript  c  is that, in three dimensions the upper and lower
components of the fourdimensional 4component spinor are charge conjugate:

both 0 and c[3] become proportional to . this implies that in equation (2.14) the
role of the matrices c[3] and 0 is just to convert upper into lower sl(2,c) indices and

2.1 compact and non compact ve gradings of the osp(n|4)

superalgebra

as it is extensively explained in [36], a non-compact group g admits unitary irreducible
representations of the lowest weight type if it has a maximal compact subgroup g0 of the

10

form g0 = h  u(1) with respect to whose lie algebra g0 there exists has a three grading
of the lie algebra g of g. in the case of a noncompact superalgebra the lowest weight
uir.s can be constructed if the three grading is generalized to a ve grading where the
even (odd) elements are integer (half-integer) graded:

g = g1  g

1

2  g0  g+

1

2  g+1 ,

hgk, gli  gk+l

gk+l = 0 for |k + l| > 1 .

(2.20)

(2.21)

for the supergroup osp(n|4)) this grading can be made in two ways, choosing as grade
zero subalgebra either the maximal compact subalgebra

g0  so(3)  so(2)  so(n )  osp(n|4)

or the non-compact subalgebra

which also exists, has the same complex extension and is also maximal.

eg0  so(1, 2)  so(1, 1)  so(n )  osp(n|4)

(2.22)

(2.23)

the existence of the double vegrading is the algebraic core of the ads4/cf t3
correspondence. decomposing a uir of osp(n|4) into representations of g0 shows its
interpretation as a supermultiplet of particles states in the bulk of ads4, while decompos-
ing it into representations of eg0 shows its interpretation as a supermultiplet of conformal

in both cases the grading is determined by the generator x of the abelian factor so(2)

primary elds on the boundary (ads4).

or so(1, 1):

[x, gk] = k gk

(2.24)

in the compact case (see [16]) the so(2) generator x is given by m04. it is interpreted
as the energy generator of the four-dimensional ads theory. it was used in [17] and [29]
for the construction of the osp(2|4) representations, yielding the long multiplets of [17]
and the short and ultra-short multiplets of [29]. we repeat such decompositions here.

we call e the energy generator of so(2), la the rotations of so(3):

and ma the boosts:

e = m04 ,
la = 1

m +
a = ma4 + im0a ,
ma = ma4 + im0a .

(2.27)

the vegrading structure of the algebra (2.27) is shown in g. 3 in the superconfor-
mal eld theory context we are interested in the action of the osp(n|4) generators on
superelds living on the minkowskian boundary (ads4). to be precise the boundary is
a compactication of d = 3 minkowski space and admits a conformal family of metrics
gmn = (z)mn conformally equivalent to the the at minkowski metric

mn = (+,,) ,

m, n, p, q = 0, 1, 2 .

(2.28)

precisely because we are interested in conformal eld theories the the choice of represen-
tative metric inside the conformal family is immaterial and the at one (2.28) is certainly
the most convenient. the requested action of the superalgebra generators is obtained
upon starting from the noncompact grading with respect to (2.23). to this eect we
dene the dilatation so(1, 1) generator d and the lorentz so(1, 2) generators j m as
follows:

d  i m34 ,

j m = i

2 mpqmpq .

(2.29)

in addition we dene the the d = 3 translation generators pm and special conformal
boosts km as follows:

pm = mm4  m3m ,
km = mm4 + m3m .

(2.30)

finally we dene the generators of d = 3 ordinary and special conformal supersymmetries,
respectively given by:

qi = 12(cid:16)ai
 = 12(cid:16)ai

 + ai(cid:17) ,
 + ai(cid:17) .

2.2 the lowest weight uir.s as seen from the compact and non

compact vegrading viewpoint

the structure of all the osp(2|4) supermultiplets relevant to kaluza klein supergravity
is known. their spin content is upper bounded by s = 2 and they fall into three classes:
long, short and ultrashort. such a result has been obtained in [29] by explicit harmonic
analysis on x 7 = m 111, namely through the analysis of a specic example of n =2 com-
pactication on ads4  x 7. as stressed in the introduction the goal of the present paper
is to reformulate the structure of these multiplets in a way appropriate for comparison
with composite operators of the three-dimensional gauge theory living on the boundary
(ads4) that behave as primary conformal elds. actually, in view of the forthcoming
kaluza-klein spectrum on x 7 = n 010 [42], that is arranged into osp(3|4) rather than
osp(2|4) multiplets, it is more convenient to begin by discussing osp(n|4) for generic n .
we start by briey recalling the procedure of [16, 43] to construct uir.s of osp(n|4)
in the compact grading (2.22). then, in a parallel way to what was done in [37] for the
case of the su(2, 2|4) superalgebra we show that also for osp(n|4)in each uir carrier
space there exists a unitary rotation that maps eigenstates of e, l2, l3 into eigenstates
of d, j 2, j2. by means of such a rotation the decomposition of the uir into so(2) 
so(3) representations is mapped into an analogous decomposition into so(1, 1)so(1, 2)
representations. while so(2)  so(3) representations describe the onshell degrees of
freedom of a bulk particle with an energy e0 and a spin s, irreducible representations of
so(1, 1)so(1, 2) describe the o-shell degrees of freedom of a boundary eld with scaling
weight d and lorentz character j. relying on this we show how to construct the on-shell
four-dimensional supereld multiplets that generate the states of these representations
and the o-shell three-dimensional supereld multiplets that build the conformal eld
theory on the boundary.

lowest weight representations of osp(n|4) are constructed starting from the basis

14

(2.27) and choosing a a vacuum state such that

mi |(e0, s, )i = 0 ,
ai
|(e0, s, )i = 0 ,

(2.34)

where e0 denotes the eigenvalue of the energy operator m04 while s and  are the labels
of an irreducible so(3) and so(n ) representation, respectively. in particular we have:

m04 |(e0, s, )i = e0 |(e0, s, )i
la la |(e0, s, )i = s(s + 1)|(e0, s, )i

l3|(e0, s, )i = s|(e0, s, )i .

(2.35)

the states lling up the uir are then built by applying the operators m and the anti-
symmetrized products of the operators ai
:

1 (cid:17)n1(cid:16)m +
(cid:16)m +

3 (cid:17)n3
2 (cid:17)n2(cid:16)m +

[ai1

1 . . . aip

p]|(e0, s, )i

(2.36)

lowest weight representations are similarly constructed with respect to vegrading
(2.32). one starts from a vacuum state that is annihilated by the conformal boosts and
by the special conformal supersymmetries

km |(d0, j, )i = 0 ,
si
 |(d0, j, )i = 0 ,

(2.37)

and that is an eigenstate of the dilatation operator d and an irreducible so(1, 2) repre-
sentation of spin j:

d |(d0, j, )i = d0 |(d0, j, )i

j m j n mn |(d0, j, )i = j(j + 1)|(d0, j, )i

j2 |(d0, j, )i = j|(d0, j, )i

(2.38)

as for the so(n ) representation the new vacuum is the same as before. the states
lling the uir are now constructed by applying to the vacuum the operators pm and the
anti-symmetrized products of qi,

(p0)p0 (p1)p1 (p2)p2 [q1i1 . . . qqiq ]|(d0, j, )i .

(2.39)

in the language of conformal eld theories the vacuum state satisfying eq.(2.37) is
named a primary state (corresponding to the value at zm = 0 of a primary conformal
eld. the states (2.39) are called the descendants.

the rotation between the so(3)  so(2) basis and the so(1, 2)  so(1, 1) basis is

performed by the operator:

which has the following properties,

u  exph i2

(e  d)i ,

du = ue ,
j0u = i ul3 ,
j1u = ul1 ,
j2u = ul2 ,

15

(2.40)

(2.41)

with respect to the grade 0 generators. furthermore, with respect to the non vanishing
grade generators we have:

k0u = i um3 ,
k1u = um1 ,
k2u = um2 ,
p0u = i um +
3 ,
p1u = um +
1 ,
p2u = um +
2 ,
qiu = i u ai
si
u = i uai
 .

(2.42)

as one immediately sees from (2.42), u interchanges the compact vegrading structure
of the superalgebra with its non compact one. in particular the so(3)  so(2)-vacuum
with energy e0 is mapped into an so(1, 2)  so(1, 1) primary state and one obtains all
the descendants (2.39) by acting with u on the particle states (2.36). furthermore from
(2.41) we read the conformal weight and the lorentz group representation of the primary
state u|(e0, s, j)i. indeed its eigenvalue with respect to the dilatation generator d is:

d0 = e0 .

(2.43)

and we nd the following relation between the casimir operators of so(1, 2) and so(3),

j 2u = ul2 ,

j 2  j 2

0 + j 2

1 + j 2
2 ,

which implies that

j = s .

(2.44)

(2.45)

hence under the action of u a particle state of energy e0 and spin s of the bulk is
mapped into a primary conformal eld of conformal weight e0 and lorentz spin s on
the boundary. this discussion is visualized in g.5

3 ads4 and ads4 as cosets and their killing vectors

in the previous section we studied osp(n|4) and its representations in two dierent bases.
the form (2.27) of the superalgebra is that we used in [29] to construct the osp(2|4)
supermultiplets from kaluza klein supergravity. it will be similarly used to obtain the
osp(3|4) spectrum on x 7 = n 010. we translated these results in terms of the form (2.32)
of the osp(n|4) algebra in order to allow a comparison with the three-dimensional cft on
the boundary. in this section we introduce the announced description of the anti de sitter
superspace and of its boundary in terms of supersolvable lie algebra parametrization as
in eq.s(1.20),(1.21). it turns out that such a description is the most appropriate for a
comparative study between ads4 and its boundary. we calculate the killing vectors of
these two coset spaces since they are needed to determine the supereld multiplets living
on both ads4 and ads4.

figure 5: the operator u = exp{i/2(e  d)} rotates the hilbert space of the physical

states labeled by the casimirs (d, j) of so(1, 1)  so(1, 2).

so we write both the bulk and the boundary superspaces as supercosets2,

(3.1)

applying supergroup elements g  osp(n|4) to the coset representatives l(y) these latter
transform as follows:

g l(y) = l(y)h(g, y) ,

(3.2)

where h(y) is some element of h  osp(n|4), named the compensator that, generically
depends both on g and on the coset point y  g/h. for our purposes it is useful to
consider the innitesimal form of (3.2), i.e. for innitesimal g we can write:

and we obtain:

g = 1 + ata ,
h = 1 + aw h
y = y + ak

the shifts in the superspace coordinates y determined by the supergroup elements (see
eq.(3.2)) dene the killing vector elds (3.5) of the coset manifold.3

let us now consider the solvable anti de sitter superspace dened in eq.s (1.20),(1.21).
it describes a gauge xed supersymmetric extension of the bulk ads4. as explained by
eq.(1.21) it is a supercoset (3.1) where g = osp(n|4) and h = cso(1, 2|n )  so(n )
using the noncompact basis (2.32), the subgroup h is given by,

a coset representative can be written as follows4:

h ads = cso(1, 2|n )  span n j m, km, si
lads(y) = exphd + i x  p + iqii ,

, t ijo .

y = (, x, ) .

(3.6)

(3.7)

in ads4|2n s-supersymmetry and k-symmetry have a non linear realization since the
corresponding generators are not part of the solvable superalgebra ssolvads that is expo-
nentiated (see eq.(2.33).

the form of the killing vectors simplies considerably if we rewrite the coset repre-

sentative as a product of exponentials

this amounts to the following coordinate change:

l(y) = exp [i z  p ]  exphiqii  exp [d]
62 + o(3)(cid:17) x ,
242 + o(3)(cid:17) i .

z = (cid:16)1  1
i = (cid:16)1  1

4 + 1

(3.8)

(3.9)

this is the parametrization that was used in [48] to get the osp(8|4)-singleton action
from the supermembrane. for this choice of coordinates the anti de sitter metric takes
the standard form (1.9). the killing vectors are

appendix a.

the boundary superspace (ads4|2n ) is formed by the points on the supercoset with

lcf t (y) = exph i x  p + iqii

(3.12)

in order to see how the supergroup acts on elds that live on this boundary we use the
fact that this submanifold is by itself a supercoset. indeed instead of h ads  osp(n|4)
as given in (3.6), we can choose the larger subalgebra

h cf t = span nd, j m, km, si

, t ijo .

(3.13)

and consider the new supercoset g/h cf t . by dention also on this smaller space we have
a non linear realization of the full orthosymplectic superalgebra. for the killing vectors

(3.15)

if we compare the killing vectors on the boundary (3.14) with those on the bulk (3.10) we
see that they are very similar. the only formal dierence is the suppression of the 
 terms.
the conceptual dierence, however, is relevant. on the boundary the transformations
generated by (3.14) are the standard superconformal transformations in threedimensional
(compactied) minkowski space. in the bulk the transformations generated by (3.10) are
superisometries of anti de sitter superspace. they might be written in completely dierent
but equivalent forms if we used other coordinate frames. the form they have is due to
the use of the solvable coordinate frame (, z, ) which is the most appropriate to study
the restriction of bulk supermultiplets to the boundary. for more details on this point we
refer the reader to appendix a

4 osp(2|4) superelds in the bulk and on the bound-

ary

as we explained in the introduction our main goal is the determination of the n = 2
three dimensional gauge theories associated with the sasakian horizons (1.15) and the
comparison between kaluza klein spectra of mtheory compactied on ads4 times such
horizons with the spectrum of primary conformal superelds of the corresponding gauge
theory. for this reason we mainly focus on the case of osp(2|4) supermultiplets. as
already stressed the structure of such supermultiplets has been determined in kaluza
klein language in [17, 29]. hence they have been obtained in the basis (2.27) of the
orthosymplectic superalgebra. here we consider their translation into the superconformal
language provided by the other basis (2.32). in this way we will construct a boundary
supereld associated with each particle supermultiplet of the bulk. the components
of the supermultiplet are kaluza klein states:
it follows that we obtain a onetoone
correspondence between kaluza klein states and components of the boundary supereld.

4.1 conformal osp(2|4) superelds: general discussion
so let us restrict our attention to n = 2.
generator that we name the hypercharge:

in this case the so(2) group has just one

since it is convenient to work with eigenstates of the hypercharge operator, we reorganize
the two grassman spinor coordinates of superspace in complex combinations:

y  =

in this new notations the killing vectors generating qsupersymmetries on the boundary
(see eq.(3.14)) take the form:

~khqii  q =


  1

2 (m)

m ,

(4.3)

a generic supereld is a function (x, ) of the bosonic coordinates x and of all the
.s expanding such a eld in power series of the .s we obtain a multiplet of xspace

20

elds that, under the action of the killing vector (4.3), form a representation of poincare
supersymmetry. such a representation can be shortened by imposing on the supereld
(x, ) constraints that are invariant with respect to the action of the killing vectors
(4.3). this is possible because of the existence of the so called superderivatives, namely
of fermionic vector elds that commute with the supersymmetry killing vectors. in our
notations the superderivatives are dened as follows:

d =
and satisfy the required property




+ 1

2 (m)

m ,

{d, q} = {d, q} = 0 .

(4.4)

(4.5)

as explained in [44] the existence of superderivatives is the manifestation at the fermionic
level of a general property of coset manifolds. for g/h the true isometry algebra is
not g, rather it is g  n(h)g where n(h)g denotes the normalizer of the stability
subalgebra h. the additional isometries are generated by rightinvariant rather than
leftinvariant vector elds that as such commute with the leftinvariant ones.
if we
agree that the killing vectors are leftinvariant vector elds than the superderivatives are
rightinvariant ones and generate the additional superisometries of poincare superspace.
shortened representations of poincare supersymmetry are superelds with a prescribed
behaviour under the additional superisometries: for instance they may be invariant under
such transformations. we can formulate these shortening conditions by writing constraints
such as

d+(x, ) = 0 .

(4.6)

the key point in our discussion is that a constraint of type (4.6) is guaranteed from
eq.s (4.5) to be invariant with respect to the superpoincare algebra, yet it is not a priori
guaranteed that it is invariant under the action of the full superconformal algebra (3.14).
investigating the additional conditions that make a constraint such as (4.6) superconfor-
mal invariant is the main goal of the present section. this is the main tool that allows a
transcription of the kaluzaklein results for supermultiplets into a superconformal lan-
guage.

to develop such a programme it is useful to perform a further coordinate change that
is quite traditional in superspace literature. given the coordinates x on the boundary (or
the coordinates z for the bulk) we set:

then the superderivatives become

ym = xm + 1

2 +m .

d+ =
d =





+


,

+ (m)

m .

(4.7)

(4.8)

it is our aim to describe supereld multiplets both on the bulk and on the boundary. it
is clear that one can do the same redenitions for the killing vector of q-supersymmetry
(4.3) and that one can introduce superderivatives also for the theory on the bulk.
in

21

that case one inserts the functions t() and () in the above formulas or if one uses the
solvable coordinates (, z, ) as in (3.9) then there is just no dierence with the boundary
case.

so let us nally turn to superelds. we begin by focusing on boundary superelds

since their treatment is slightly easier than the treatment of bulk superelds.

denition 4.1 a primary supereld is dened as follows (see [37, 47]),

; y (0) = y0 (0)

; j2 (0) = j (0)

(4.11)

from the above dention one sees that the primary supereld ads(x, ) is actually
obtained by acting with the coset representative (3.12) on the so(1, 2)so(1, 1)-primary
state. hence we know how it transforms under the innitesimal transformations of the
group osp(2|4). indeed one simply uses (3.4) to obtain the result. for example under
dilatation we have:

d ads(x, ) = x    1

i + d0! (x, ),
2i 

(4.12)

where the term d0 comes from the compensator in (3.15). of particular interest is the
transformation under special supersymmetry since it imposes the constraints for shorten-
ing,

sads(x, ) =k [s](x, ) + ei xp +iqi(cid:16)d  i m jm + s  y(cid:17) (0) . (4.13)

for completeness we give the form of s in the y-basis where it gets a relatively concise
form,

k [s] =  (y  )
k [s+] = +y   + i pqmyp(cid:16)p+(cid:17)

let us now turn to a direct discussion of multiplet shortening and consider the super-
conformal invariance of poincare constraints constructed with the superderivatives d.
the simplest example is provided by the chiral supermultiplet. by denition this is a
scalar supereld chiral(y, ) obeying the constraint (4.6) which is solved by boosting only
along q and not along q+:

chiral(y, ) = ei yp ++q

(0),

(4.15)

22

hence we have

on the bulk or

chiral(, y, ) = x(, y) + +(, y) + ++h(, y)

chiral(y, ) = x(y) + +(y) + ++h(y)

on the boundary. the eld components of the chiral multiplet are:

x = ei yp (0) ,

 = i ei yp q(0) ,

h =  1

4 ei yp qq(0) .

for completeness, we write the supereld  also in the x-basis5,

(x) = x(x) + +(x) + (++)h(x) + 1

2+mmx(x)

+ 1

4(++)/(x) + 1

16 (++)()x(x)

= exp(cid:16) 1

2 +mm(cid:17) (y) .

because of (4.5), we are guaranteed that under qsupersymmetry the chiral supereld
chiral transforms into a chiral supereld. we should verify that this is true also for s
supersymmetry. to say it simply we just have to check that schiral does not depend
on . this is not generically true, but it becomes true if certain extra conditions on the
quantum numbers of the primary state are satised. such conditions are the same one
obtains as multiplet shortening conditions when constructing the uir.s of the superalge-
bra with the norm method of freedman and nicolai [16] or with the oscillator method of
gunaydin and collaborators [26, 25, 36, 37] 6.

in the specic instance of the chiral multiplet, looking at (4.13) and (4.14) we see that

in schiral the terms depending on  are the following ones:

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

s(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =  (d0 + y0)  = 0 ,

they cancel if

d0 = y0 .

(4.21)
eq.(4.21) is easily recognized as the unitarity condition for the existence of osp(2|4)
hypermultiplets (see [17, 29]). the algebra (a.11) ensures that the chiral multiplet also
transforms into a chiral multiplet under km. moreover we know that the action of the
compensators of km on the chiral multiplet is zero. furthermore, the compensators of
the generators pm, qi, jm on the chiral multiplet are zero and from (3.4) we conclude that
their generators act on the chiral multiplet as the killing vectors.

notice that the linear part of the s-supersymmetry transformation on the chiral mul-
tiplet has the same form of the q-supersymmetry but with the parameter taken to be
q = i y  s. as already stated the non-linear form of s-supersymmetry is the conse-
quence of its gauge xing which we have implicitly imposed from the start by choosing
the supersolvable lie algebra parametrization of superspace and by taking the coset rep-
resentatives as in (3.7) and (3.12). 7 in addition to the chiral multiplet there exists also
the complex conjugate antichiral multiplet chiral = antichiral with opposite hypercharge
and the relation d0 = y0.

5where  = mm .
6we are particularly grateful to s. ferrara for explaining to us this general idea that, extended from
the case of ads5/cf t4 to the case ads4/cf t3, has been an essential guiding line in the development
of the present work

4.2 matching the kaluza klein results for osp(2|4) supermulti-

plets with boundary conformal superelds

it is now our purpose to reformulate the n = 2 multiplets found in kaluza klein su-
pergravity [29] in terms of superelds living on the boundary of the ads4 spacetime
manifold. this is the key step to convert information coming from classical harmonic
analysis on the compact manifold x 7 into predictions on the spectrum of conformal pri-
mary operators present in the threedimensional gauge theory of the m2brane. although
the results obtained in [29] refer to a specic case, the structure of the multiplets is general
and applies to all n = 2 compactications, namely to all sasakian horizons x 7. similarly
general are the recipes discussed in the present section to convert kaluzaklein data into
boundary superelds.

as shown in [29] there are three types of long multiplets with the following bulk spin

content:

and four types of short multiplets with the following bulk spin content:

1. the long graviton multiplet

2. the long gravitino multiplet

3. the long vector multiplets

1. the short graviton multiplet

2. the short gravitino multiplet

3. the short vector multiplet

4. the hypermultiplet

finally there are the ultrashort multiplets corresponding to the massless multiplets
available in n = 2 supergravity and having the following bulk spin content:

1. the massless graviton multiplet

2. the massless vector multiplet

interpreted as superelds on the boundary the long multiplets correspond to unconstrained
superelds and their discussion is quite straightforward. we are mostly interested in short
multiplets that correspond to composite operators of the microscopic gauge theory with
protected scaling dimensions. in supereld language, as we have shown in the previous
section, short multiplets are constrained superelds.

superconformal theory is to impose a gauge-xing condition and then modify q-supersymmetry by means
of a decomposition rule, i.e. adding to it special supersymmetry with specic parameters that depend
on the supersymmetry parameters, such that the gauge-xing condition becomes invariant under the
modied supersymmetry.
in our case we still have the standard form of q-supersymmetry but upon
gauge xing s-supersymmetry has become non-linear. the fact that s-supersymmetry partly resembles q-
supersymmetry comes from the fact that it can be seen as a q-like supersymmetry with its own superspace
coordinates, which upon gauge xing have become dependent on the -coordinates.

24

just as on the boundary, also in the bulk, we obtain such constraints by means of the
bulk superderivatives. in order to show how this works we begin by discussing the chiral
supereld in the bulk and then show how it is obtained from the hypermultiplet found in
kaluza klein theory [29].

4.2.1 chiral superelds are the hypermultiplets: the basic example

the treatment for the bulk chiral eld is completely analogous to that of chiral supereld
on the boundary.

generically bulk superelds are given by:

using the parametrization (3.9) we can rewrite (4.22) in the following way:

ads(, x, ) = exphd + i x  p + iqii (0) ,
ads(, z, ) = exphi z  p + iqii  exp [d0] (0) .
then the generator d acts on this eld as follows:
d ads(, z, ) = z    1
i + d0! ads(, z, ) .
2i 

(4.22)

(4.23)

(4.24)

just as for boundary chiral superelds, also in the bulk we nd that the constraint (4.6)
is invariant under the s-supersymmetry rule (3.10) if and only if:

d0 = y0

(4.25)

furthermore, looking at (4.23) one sees that for the bulk superelds d0 = 0 is forbidden.
this constraint on the scaling dimension together with the relation e0 = d0, coincides
with the constraint:
(4.26)
dening the osp(2|4) hypermultiplet uir of osp(2|4) constructed with the norm method
and in the formulation (2.27) of the superalgebra (see [17, 29]). the transformation of
the bulk chiral supereld under s, pm, qi, jm is simply given by the bulk killing vectors.
in particular the form of the s-supersymmetry killing vector coincides with that given in
(4.14) for the boundary.

e0 = |y0|

as we saw a chiral supereld in the bulk describes an osp(2|4) hypermultiplet. to

where we have collected the particle states forming a hypermultiplet as it appears in
kaluza klein supergravity on ads4  x 7, whenever x 7 is sasakian. the names of the
elds are the standard ones introduced in [15] for the linearization of d=11 supergravity
on ads4  x 7 and used in [17, 29]. applying the rotation matrix u of eq. (2.40) to the
states in the upper part of this table we indeed nd the eld components (4.18) of the
chiral supermultiplet.

having claried how to obtain the four-dimensional chiral supereld from the osp(2|4)
hypermultiplet we can now obtain the other shortened osp(2|4) superelds from the
information that was obtained in [29]. in [29] all the eld components of the osp(2|4)
multiplets were listed together with their spins s0, energy e0 and their hypercharge y0.
this is sucient to reconstruct the particle states of the multiplets which are given by the
states (2.34). indeed the energy determines the number of energy boosts that are applied
to the vacuum in order to get the state. the hypercharge determines the number of a+
and/or a present. finally s0 tells us what spin we should get. in practice this means
that we always have to take the symmetrization of the spinor indices, since (1 . . . n)
yields a spin- n
2 representation. following [17] we ignore the unitary representations of
so(3, 2) that are built by the energy boosts m +
i and we just list the ground states for
each uir of so(2, 3) into which the uir of osp(2|4) decomposes.

4.2.2 supereld description of the short vector multiplet

let us start with the short massive vector multiplet. from [29] we know that the constraint
for shortening is

(4.30)

where we used the same notation for the rotated as for the original states and up to an
irrelevant factor 1
4. we follow the same procedure also for the other short and massless
multiplets. namely in the supereld transcription of our multiplets we use the same
names for the superspace eld components as for the particle elds appearing in the
so(3)so(2) basis. moreover when convenient we rescale some eld components without
mentioning it explicitly. the list of states appearing in (4.30) are the components of a
supereld

which is the explicit solution of the following constraint

d+d+vector = 0 .

(4.31)

(4.32)

imposed on a supereld of the form (4.22) with hypercharge y0.

in superspace literature a supereld of type (4.31) is named a linear supereld. if we
consider the variation of a linear supereld with respect to s, such variation contains, a
priori, a term of the form

svector(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = 1

2 (d0 + y0 + 1) ()+
l ,

(4.33)

which has to cancel if vector is to transform into a linear multiplet under s. hence the
following condition has to be imposed

which is identical with the bound for the vector multiplet shortening e0 = y0 + 1 found
in [17, 29].

d0 = y0  1 .

the stronger constraint

figure 6: conformal superelds are composite operators in the gauge theory

similarly as for the vector multiplet we may write this multiplet as a gauge xed mul-
tiplet with local gauge symmetries that include local coordinate transformations, local
supersymmetry and local so(2), in other words full supergravity. however this is not the
goal of our work where we prepare to interprete the bulk gauge elds as composite states
in the boundary conformal eld theory..

this completes the treatment of the short osp(2|4) multiplets of [29]. we have found
that all of them are linear multiplets with the extra constraint that they have to transform
into superelds of the same type under s-supersymmetry. such constraint is identical
with the shortening conditions found in the other constructions of unitary irreducible
representations of the orthosymplectic superalgebra.

5 n = 2, d = 3 gauge theories and their rheonomic

construction

next, as announced in the introduction, we turn to consider gauge theories in three space
time dimensions with n = 2 supersymmetry. from the view point of the ads4/cf t3
correspondence these gauge theories, whose elementary elds we collectively denote i(x),
are microscopic eld theories living on the m2 brane world volume such that suitable
composite operators (see also g.6):

o(x) = i1(x, ) . . . in(x)ci1...in

(5.1)

32

can be identied with the components of the conformal superelds described in the

previous section and matching the kaluza klein classical spectrum.

according to the specic horizon x 7, the world volume gauge group is of the form:

gw v
gauge = u(k1 n)1  . . .  u(knn)n

where ki and i are integer number and where the correspondence is true in the large
n   limit. indeed n is to be identied with the number of m2 branes in the stack.
in addition the gauge theory has a avor group which coincides with the gauge group
of kaluza klein supergravity, namely with the isometry group of the x 7 horizon:

gw v

f lavor = gbulk

kk = isometry(x 7)

(5.3)

since our goal is to study the general features of the ads4/cf t3 correspondence, rather
than specic cases, we concentrate on the construction of a generic n = 2 gauge theory
with an arbitrary gauge group and an arbitrary number of chiral multiplets in generic
interaction. we are mostly interested in the nal formulae for the scalar potential and
on the restrictions that guarantee an enlargement of supersymmetry to n = 4 or n = 8,
but we provide a complete construction of the lagrangian and of the supersymmetry
transformation rules. to this eect we utilize the time honored method of rheonomy
[44, 45, 46] that yields the the result for the lagrangian and the supersymmetry rules in
component form avoiding the too much implicit notation of supereld formulation. the
rst step in the rheonomic construction of a rigid supersymmetric theory involves writing
the structural equations of rigid superspace.

5.1 n = 2, d = 3 rigid superspace
the d=3, n extended superspace is viewed as the supercoset space:

mn3 =

iso(1, 2|n )

so(1, 2) 

z [iso(1, 2|n )]

so(1, 2)  irn (n1)/2

(5.4)

where iso(1, 2|n ) is the n extended poincare superalgebra in threedimensions.
it
is the subalgebra of osp(n|4) (see eq. (2.32)) spanned by the generators jm, pm, qi.
the central extension z [iso(1, 2|n )] which is not contained in osp(n|4) is obtained
by adjoining to iso(1, 2|n ) the central charges that generate the subalgebra irn (n1)/2.
specializing our analysis to the case n=2, we can dene the new generators:

q = 2q = (q1  iq2)
qc = 2iq+ = i(q1 + iq2)
z = z 12



(5.5)

(5.6)

the left invariant oneform  on mn3 is:

 = iv mpm  imnjmn + icq  iqc + ibz .

the superalgebra (2.32) denes all the structure constants apart from those relative to
the central charge that are trivially determined. hence we can write:

d     = (cid:16)dv m  m

n  v n + i  m + i

c  mc(cid:17) pm

5.2 rheonomic construction of the n = 2, d = 3, lagrangian
as stated we are interested in the generic form of n = 2, d = 3 super yang mills theory
coupled to n chiral multiplets arranged into a generic representation r of the gauge group
g.
in n = 2, d = 3 supersymmetric theories, two formulations are allowed: the onshell
and the oshell one. in the onshell formulation which contains only the physical elds,
the supersymmetry transformations rules close the supersymmetry algebra only upon use
of the eld equations. on the other hand the oshell formulation contains further aux-
iliary, non dynamical elds that make it possible for the supersymmetry transformations
rules to close the supersymmetry algebra identically. by solving the eld equations of
the auxiliary elds these latter can be eliminated and the onshell formulation can be
retrieved. we adopt the oshell formulation.

5.2.1 the gauge multiplet

the threedimensional n = 2 vector multiplet contains the following lie-algebra valued
elds:
(5.11)

(a, , c, m, p ) ,

34

where a = aiti is the real gauge connection oneform,  and c are two complex dirac
spinors (the gauginos), m and p are real scalars; p is an auxiliary eld.

the eld strength is:

the covariant derivative on the other elds of the gauge multiplets is dened as:

f = da + ia  a .

x = dx + i [a, x] .
from (5.12) and (5.13) we obtain the bianchi identity:

the rheonomic parametrization of the curvatures is given by:

2x = i [f, x] .

mv m  imcv m + im(cid:16)

mm = v nnmm + imc  i
m = v nnm + mnmnc  mfnpnpc
[pfmn] = 0
[mn]m = i [fmn, m]
[mn] = i [fmn, ]

+imp c + m [c, ]

c

m [, m] + m [c, m]

(5.16)
the oshell formulation of the theory contains an arbitrariness in the choice of the
functional dependence of the auxiliary elds on the physical elds. consistency with the
bianchi identities forces the generic expression of p as a function of m to be:

,

where , ei are arbitrary real parameters and c i
ei

p i = 2m i + eic i

is the projector on the center of z[g] of
the gauge lie algebra. the terms in the lagrangian proportional to  and  are separately
supersymmetric. in the bosonic lagrangian, the part proportional to  is a chern simons
term, while the part proportional to  constitutes the fayet iliopoulos term. note that
the fayet iliopoulos terms are associated only with a central abelian subalgebra of the
gauge algebra g.

enforcing (5.17) we get the following equations of motion for the spinors:

(5.17)

/ = 2i  i [, m]
/c = 2ic + i [c, m]



35

(5.18)

taking the covariant derivatives of these, we obtain the equations of motion for the bosonic
elds:

5.2.2 chiral multiplet

the chiral multiplet contains the following elds:

c

m  mc(cid:17) v nv p

(5.23)

(5.24)

(cid:16)zi, i, h i(cid:17)

where zi are complex scalar elds which parametrize a kahler manifold. since we are
interested in microscopic theories with canonical kinetic terms we take this kahler mani-
fold to be at and we choose its metric to be the constant ij   diag(+, +, . . . , +). the
other elds in the chiral multiplet are i which is a two components dirac spinor and h i
which is a complex scalar auxiliary eld. the index i runs in the representation r of g.

the covariant derivative of the elds x i in the chiral multiplet is:

x i = dx i + iiiai(ti)ijx j ,

(5.25)

where (ti)ij are the hermitian generators of g in the representation r. the covariant
derivative of the complex conjugate elds x i

is:

x i

= dx i

 iiiai(t i)ij x j

the rheonomic parametrization of the curvatures is given by:

5.2.3 the spacetime lagrangian

in the rheonomic approach ([44]), the total threedimensional n=2 lagrangian:

(5.35)
is a closed (dln =2 = 0) threeform dened in superspace. the action is given by the
integral of ln =2 on a generic bosonic threedimensional surface m3 in superspace:

ln =2 = lgauge + lchiral

supersymmetry transformations can be viewed as global translations in superspace which
move m3. then, being ln =2 closed, the action is invariant under global supersymmetry
transformations.

we choose as bosonic surface the one dened by:

the bosonic matter eld content is given by two kinds of elds. first we have a com-

multiplet. secondly, we have an n-uplet of quaternions q, which parametrize a (at)12
hyperkahler manifold:

q =



q1 = q1|0  iq1|xx

6 conclusions

in this paper we have discussed an essential intermediate step for the comparison between
kaluza klein supergravity compactied on manifolds ads4x 7 and superconformal eld
theories living on an m2 brane world volume. focusing on the case with n = 2 super-
symmetry we have shown how to convert kaluza klein data on osp(2|4) supermultiplets
into conformal superelds living in three dimensional superspace. in addition since such
conformal superelds are supposed to describe composite operators of a suitable d = 3
gauge theory we have studied the general form of three dimesnional n = 2 gauge theo-
ries. hence in this paper we have set the stage for the discussion of specic gauge theory
models capable of describing, at an infrared conformal point the kaluza klein spectra,
associated with the sasakian sevenmanifolds (1.15) classied in the eighties and now
under active consideration once again. indeed the possibility of constructing dual pairs
{m2brane gauge theory,supergravity on g/h } provides a challenging testing ground
for the exciting ads/cft correspondence.

a calculation of the killing vectors

to evaluate the left-hand-side of (3.2) which has the form ea eb, we use the campell-
baker-hausdor formula for a an innitesimal generator:

ea eb = exp(cid:16)a + b + z1[b, a] + z2[b, [b, a]] +    + zn[b, [   [b, a]  ]](cid:17) ,

(a.1)

2, z2 = 1

where z0 = 1, z1 =  1
720    13 we plug the equation (b.3) itera-
tively into (a.1). then one sees that for the operators d, pm and qi, the compensators
hd, hp and hq are zero. we can determine the complete expressions for their killing
vectors, 14

these functions satisfy some dierential relations that are needed for the closure of the
algebra. for example,

   =  ,
2 t =  ,
t  td = 1
2 t ,
 + d  d = 1
2  ,

(a.6)

which ensures closure of the commutators [d, pm], [d, qi] and {qi, qj}. upon taking
an so(1, 2)-rotation for g = ejj in (3.2) one sees that the compensator does not vanish
but equals g,

hj (y) = ejj .

(a.7)

consequently one nds the complete expression for the killing vector of the generator
j m,

2(cid:16)im(cid:17)
similarly, for the so(n ) group element g = etij t ij we nd,

k [j m] = mpqxpq

notice that both for the so(1, 2) and the so(n ) the killing vectors do not depend on
the coordinate . finding the superspace operators for si
, km is more involved. we
restrict ourselves here to nd the superspace operators for small , i.e.
close to the
boundary of ads. however we have checked that the expressions for the killing vectors
(3.10) and the compensators (3.11) are complete. the s-supersymmetry is needed to
nd extra constraints on constrained superelds. there is no need to consider the k-
transformations. a multiplet that transforms properly under s-supersymmetry will also
transform properly under k-transformations since

km = i

(a.13)

using the functions (a.4) it turns out that the change of coordinates from the (, x, )-
basis to the (, z, )-basis can actually be written as

x = () z ,
 = t()  .

(a.14)

using the properties (a.6) one sees that indeed the bounary killing vectors get the simple
form of (3.10).

treating the boundary as a dierent coset, one understands that the superspace oper-
ators a priori are not retrieved by just putting  = 0 in the operators (a.12). to illustrate
this, let us look at the dilatation. let us take g = e d, then on the coset g/h cf t we
need a compensator hcf t

d = g and nd

(a.15)

and one sees that this is not the killing vector kd in the parametrization (, x, ) that
acts on the coset representative (3.7) with  = 0. yet this is clearly the case for the
(, z, ) parametrization. and hence the parametrization (3.8) is the most suitable for a
comparative study between the boundary and the bulk of ads superspace.
