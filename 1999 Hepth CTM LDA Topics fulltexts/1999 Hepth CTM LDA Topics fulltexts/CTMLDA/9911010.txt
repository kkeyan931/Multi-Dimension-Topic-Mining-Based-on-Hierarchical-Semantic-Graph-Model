(40) note solution also constant boundary. massive eld case, boundary solution given rboundary massive (r) = aout 1 r 1 (cid:18)2rh r (cid:19)12! + 1 r 1 + (cid:18)2rh r (cid:19)12! , (41) vanishes innity due eect eld mass. therefore massive eld conned within innite boundary. hand, key ingredient null radiation massless case due asymptotic forms eld solutions. massless case, boundary solution far region solution ads bulk, means modes mixing occur, whereas dilaton coupled 10 massive case, boundary solution drastically dierent far region solution bulk bulk solution decomposed ingoing outgoing modes boundary. therefore, fact gives nonvanishing hawking temperature latter two cases. conclude two dimensions massive hawking radiation ads black hole possible since mass term eld equation plays role constant background eld, similar dilaton coupled case. acknowledgments would like thank m. s. yoon discussions. authors wish acknowledge nancial support korea research foundation made program year 1997. 11
