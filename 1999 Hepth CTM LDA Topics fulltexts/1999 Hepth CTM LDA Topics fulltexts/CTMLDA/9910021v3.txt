abstract: we explain that supersymmetric attractors in general have several crit-
ical points due to the algebraic nature of the stabilization equations. we show that
the critical values of the cosmological constant of the ads5 vacua are given by the
topological (moduli-independent) formulae analogous to the entropy of the d = 5
supersymmetric black holes. in one-moduli case critical points with positive denite
metric and gauge couplings exist under condition that the central charge changes
the sign from one critical point to the other. we have found several families of
z2-symmetric critical points where the central charge has equal absolute values but
opposite signs in two attractor points. we present examples of interpolating solutions
and discuss their generic features.

1. the concept of supersymmetric attractors with respect to black hole entropy
was introduced in [1]. the so-called stabilization equations [2, 3] for the behaviour
of the moduli near the charged extremal black holes horizon have been studied ex-
tensively during the last few years. it has been established that the supersymmetric
xed points of the theory correspond to the minimum of the central charge1 in the
physical part of the moduli space, when the metric is positive-denite [4].

the issue of uniqueness of the basin of attraction of the supersymmetric systems
related to calabi-yau black holes of ungauged supergravity [5] and cosmological
constant in d = 5 gauged supergravity [5] was raised in [6]. it was also shown there
that the critical points of these two theories are dened by the same equations. it
was emphasized in [7] that one may look for more than one basin of attraction in
the context of the black hole xed points. the situation however was not resolved in
general: on the one hand one may expect that the black hole with given electric and
magnetic charges in the theory with compactication on particular cy space have a
unique entropy; on the other hand the stabilization equations [3, 8, 6]

being algebraic equations, may lead to multiple solutions2. the reason is that one
starts with the system of n quadratic equations (1) for n variables ti. they can be
reduced to some higher order algebraic equation for each of the xed moduli. for
example, in case i = 1, 2 one has to solve quadratic equations that have 2 solutions,
etc.

indeed, solutions describing black holes with multiple basins of attraction have
been studied in [9]. it was found for the 2 moduli black holes in d = 4 that only in
one basin of attraction the scalar and vector elds have positive metric. this sug-
gested that the argument based on the requirement of uniqueness of entropy may be
correct, and only one basin of attraction is physically acceptable. recently a solution
with two basins of attraction of analogous stabilization equations was found in [10]
in application to anti-de sitter space ads5, but the issue of positivity of vector eld
metric was not analyzed there. as a result, the possibility to have physically accept-
able black hole or ads5 congurations with multiple basins of attraction remained
open.

recent developments with ads/cft correspondence [11] and bps domain walls
[12]-[18] stimulated us to clarify the situation with the multiple basins of attraction
for supersymmetric attractors. the purpose of this paper is to establish the con-
ditions under which supersymmetric attractors may have more than one physically

acceptable basin of attraction. we will also study the congurations interpolating
between two basins.

the reason why these two completely dierent phenomena, d = 5 cy black holes
and the cosmological constant of ads5 space, may be treated simultaneously at the
supersymmetric critical points was explained in [6]. it is important to stress here
however that out of critical points the systems are dierent: the main dierence is
that the term with (iz)2 enters with the opposite sign in the black hole potential
and in the gauge theory potential, as shown below.

to nd the black hole entropy we are looking for the supersymmetric critical
points of the black hole potential [4], which for d = 5 ungauged n = 2 supergravity
is given by v = z 2 + 3
2 gijizjz. here the central charge z = tiqi depends on real
moduli ti and on electric charges of the black hole qi. the supersymmetric critical
points are at z,i = 0, where iv = 4z iz  6 tijkjzkz = 0, where tijk is a

function of moduli and cijk. at the supersymmetric critical point of the central
charge, which is also a supersymmetric critical point of the black hole potential, the
value of the potential denes the bps mass and the black hole entropy:

m 2

bp s = |z|2,

(m 2

bp s)cr = |z|2

cr(cijk, qi) = |vcr| at z,i = 0.

(2)

in the supersymmetric critical points the second derivative of the black hole
potential is proportional to the metric on the moduli space: v,i;j = 8
3gijvcr at iv =
iz = 0. for the positive moduli space metric the potential v has a local minimum
whenever the stabilization equation has a solution with non-vanishing central charge.
when the potential is non-zero at the critical point, it denes the black hole entropy.
the entropy s = 2
12

s is a function of the critical value of the bps mass

s = (m 2

bp s)3/2

cr = |z|3

cr(cijk, qi) = |vcr|3/2.

(3)

now consider the supersymmetric critical points of the potential of the u(1)
gauged n = 2 d = 5 supergravity. the size of the ads5 throat is dened by the
extrema of the gauged supergravity potential [5, 6]. the relevant potential is equal to
6p , where p = z 2  3
4gijizjz. in the context of gauged supergravity the central
charge z is a moduli-dependent combination of gravitino and gaugino charges v i,
which is dened by z = tivi, where vi is the charge dening the gravitinogravitino
vector and gauginogauginovector interactions. the critical points of the p are

given by ip = z iz + q3/2 tijkjzkz = 0, and as before the supersymmetric

critical points of the central charge are also the supersymmetric critical points of the
potential. the value of the potential p at the critical point is given by the square of
the bps mass as a function of cijk and vi:
bp s)cr = |z|2

cr(cijk, vi) = |pcr| at z,i = 0.

bp s = |z|2,

(m 2

the ads5 vacua are solutions of this theory with unbroken supersymmetry. the
cosmological constant of the relevant ads5 space coincides with the critical value of

2

the bps mass extremized in the moduli space. at the supersymmetric critical points,
where z,i = 0, one nds

ads5 = 6|tivi|2 = 6|zcr(vi, cijk)|2 = 6m 2

bp s

at

z,i = 0.

(5)

in the supersymmetric critical points the second derivative of the potential is pro-
portional to the metric on the moduli space: (p ),i;j = iip =  2
3 gij(z 2)cr
at ip = iz = 0. for the positive moduli space metric the potential p has a
maximum whenever the stabilization equation has a solution. when the potential
is non-zero at the critical point, it denes the cosmological constant. thus, as ex-
plained in sec. 4.2 of [6] the critical points of the bps mass of ungauged supergravity
depending on the electric charges of the black hole solutions qi have to be replaced
by the gravitinogaugino charges (fi terms) vi to nd the critical points of the bps
mass of the gauged theory. in ungauged theory one nds the black hole entropy from
the bps mass, in the gauged theory one nds the cosmological constant. thus as a
function of gravitino charges vi and cy intersection numbers cijk, the cosmolog-
ical constant at the supersymmetric critical point is given by the same topological
formula, which denes the entropy of the extreme supersymmetric black holes: the
value of the cosmological constant is moduli-independent and depends only on vi
and cijk.

thus all previous studies of cy black hole entropy may be used for understanding
in what follows we will focus our attention on the issue of non-

the ads5 vacua.
uniqueness of supersymmetric critical points of this theory.

simultaneously with the study of the critical points of the central charge, one
has to verify that at the given critical point some natural physical conditions are
satised. we will try to nd xed points where both the metric of the moduli space
gij = 3cijktitj
,k and the metric of the vector space (the gauge coupling matrix)
gij = i j (lnv)|v=1 are positive.3
in some cases these conditions are sucient to guarantee the uniqueness of the
critical point for the black hole entropy. such cases give examples of supersymmetric
attractors with one basin of attraction. in some other cases specied by dierent
values of the intersection numbers cijk and charges qi or vi more than one critical
point satisfying physical conditions may be available. particularly in the case of
many moduli when the stabilization equations are higher order algebraic equations,
one may expect to nd several critical points consistent with physical requirements.
in what follows we will present conditions for multi basin attractors, give examples
and discuss the conceptual issues associated with such systems.

3negative sign of kinetic terms in the lagrangian usually leads to vacuum instability. however,
if one simultaneously changes the sign of kinetic and potential energy of some elds and if these
elds live only in a part of the universe dierent from ours (or on a dierent brane) then one can
avoid instabilities. this possibility deserves investigation because it may provide an explanation of
the vanishing of the cosmological constant [19].

we start with an example for i = 1, 2 when the algebraic system common for
d=4 and d=5 theories has a general solution describing d=4 and d=5 black holes
and ads5 vacua. in this example the issue of the uniqueness of the d=4 black hole
entropy and the possibility of the non-uniqueness of the entropy of d=5 black holes
and the critical points of the ads5 vacua will be claried. one may hope to learn
some lessons from this simple system which may help to understand the theories
with many moduli.

2. consider the simple case of i = 1, 2 and generic cijk and vi. we choose

c111 = a , c112 = b , c122 = c , c222 = d ,

(6)

and dene t1  x and t2  y. the stabilization equations consist of a system of two
quadratic equations for two variables:

ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = v1 ,
bx2 + 2cxy + dy2 = v2 .

we introduce the following notations4

the metric of the moduli space is required to be positive everywhere in the

moduli space. this leads to a requirement that

l2  4mn < 0 ,

m > 0 ,

n > 0 .

it follows from the fact that the expression

m2  l + n > 0

(13)

(14)

has to be positive for all values of real  = y

physical theory. in addition it provides the condition that the critical points are local

have two sets of solutions of stabilization equations. let us call them a + critical

respectively. the condition for the existence of these solutions is that

(18)

one can verify that this condition is satised if the moduli space metric is positive,
i.e. eq. (13) is satised. notice that l2  4mn < 0 and m > 0, and therefore the
second term in x2

 is always negative:

this means that we may look for the situation when x2

are real. this is consistent with the fact that our original variables ti = ti

if

the critical values of the cube of the central charge are given by the following ex-

here again we see that it is consistent to have z+ < 0 and z > 0 for the two critical
points. for the cosmological constant case, there is an analogous expression for the
central charge in terms of vi instead of qi.

the critical values of the black hole entropy and the critical values of the cos-
mological constant are given by analogous formulae. by substitution of the critical
values of x2

cosmological constant:

now we have to study the values of vector space metric (gauge couplings) at the

critical points:

gij =

cijktk tlvl .

(26)

a tedious calculation, analogous to that performed in [9] with respect to d = 4 black
holes and moduli metric, allows us to nd the generic expression for the determinant
of the gauge coupling matrix at the critical point:

(det gij) =

z 3


d > 0

for m > 0 .

(27)

for black holes z = q1x + q2y and for the cosmological constant it equals z =
v1x + v2y.

now we see that one may be able to justify the existence of both critical points
as possibly acceptable under the following conditions: we have to require that at
the + critical point the critical value of the central charge z+ is negative and at
the  critical point the critical value of the central charge z is positive.
in such
case the determinant of gauge couplings is positive at both critical points. but
this is precisely the condition obtained from the consistent solution of the attractor
equations as shown in (22)!
in such cases the determinant of the gauge coupling
matrix is positive at both critical points.

note that we still have to nd out whether the eigenvalues of gij are actually
positive.
it may happen that the determinant is positive but the eigenvalues are
both negative. fortunately a completely general treatment is possible in the simple
1-moduli case. first we note that det gij = g11 g22  g2
12 and therefore for all cases
where we have established that det gij > 0 we nd that

g11 g22 > g2

12 > 0 .

(28)

6

thus for all cases at hand if we can verify that e.g. g11 is positive, this will guarantee
that also g22 is positive and that the total gauge coupling matrix is positive-denite.
to derive the critical values of g11 we start with (26) and get

g11 =

1

3 (cid:16)q2

1  2y2




d(cid:17) .

(29)

now we can provide a generic answer to the problem of the positivity of the vector
metric. both critical points are locally stable i z+ < 0 and z > 0, as was already
required by the positivity of the det of the vector metric. the same condition provides
the positivity of g11 since the rst term in (29) is always positive and the second
one is also positive, as follows from eqs. (21), (22). thus the moduli space metric
and the gauge coupling matrix are both positive denite i

l2  4mn < 0 ,

m > 0 ,

n > 0 ,

z+ < 0 ,

z > 0 ,

(30)

and one can claim that there are two critical points that form the stable local minima
of the entropy of d=5 black holes and of the absolute value of the cosmological constant
of the ads5 vacua.

these are generic conditions in the one-moduli problem under which two physi-
cally acceptable critical points are possible. one can give many numerical examples
of cases where these conditions are satised. consider for example the case suggested

in [10] which in our notation is a = 0, b = 2, c = 2.83, d = 6, v1 = 1, v2 = 0.63.

it has been veried in [10] that the moduli space metric is positive. however the
vector space metric was not studied. as it is now clear from our studies, the vec-
tor space metric for this example is indeed positive since the central charge has an
opposite sign in two critical points.

an interesting comment can be made about the properties of the excitations
around the two gauged theory vacua. the gravitino mass near one critical point is
positive mgrav = z > 0 and the one near the second critical point is negative
m+grav = z+ < 0 since its value at each critical point is the value of the central
charge. the issue of the positive versus negative fermion mass in d = 5 was discussed
in [20], where it was noticed that both the positive mass theory and the negative
mass theory may exist. the relations between these theories include a change of 
matrices into , as well as of the representation of the little part so(4) of the
lorentz group. interestingly, we need both versions of the theory to make acceptable
not only the vacuum state but also the excitations around each vacuum.

the conditions for more than one basin of attraction can be easily violated, in
which case the system has only one attractor point. for example we may have some
cijk and qi (or vi) for which either the solution is unique or the central charge has
the same sign at both critical points. this would mean that one of the critical points
is unstable with respect to the generation of vector elds and has to be excluded.

7

typically, the values of z 2 at two critical points is dierent. an interesting
question therefore here is: is the solution with z+ < 0 and z > 0 and |z+| = |z|
possible? the equation for our parameters specifying this case is:

a  v2(dv 2

1 + bv 2

2  2cv1v2) + d" f l + 2em

(l2  4mn)# = 0 .

(31)

we have found 3 families of solutions for such congurations. we take the following
set of parameters a = 0, b = 1/3, d = 1, v1 = 1 and we do not specify c and
v2, except that c2 > 4
2c or
v2 = 3
metric and of the gauge coupling matrix are satised for any of these solutions, for
all c2 > 4/9. for example, a = 0, b = 1/3, c = 4/3, d = 1, v1 = 1, v2 = 2 gives a
consistent set.

9. equation a = 0 has three types of solutions: v2 = 3

3. having established the existence of two supersymmetric critical points de-
scribing the ads5 vacua some of which may have equal cosmological constant we
would like to nd also the interpolating domain wall solution. here we follow [15, 16]
and take an ansatz

ds2 = e2a(r)dxdx + dr2 = u 2dxdx +

,

(32)

where u = ea. at the critical points where (ra)2
cr the geometry is an
ads5 space with a cosmological constant  = 6z 2
cr. the equations of motion of
the gauged supergravity describing a domain wall can be derived from the energy
functional:

cr = z 2

e =

(33)

here   r, a  ra. an analogous expression was also presented in [15, 17]
where it was also noticed that as dierent from the standard bps situation one of
the squares enters with the negative sign. our energy functional has a non-trivial
moduli space metric g = g which is absent in [15, 16, 17]. this term is important
because it provides a possibility to obtain a smooth supersymmetric solution for (r)
interpolating between the two dierent vacua. the rst order equations of motion
of the gauged supergravity which admit killing spinors are [10, 15, 16, 17]

(r) = 3g1z, ,

a = z .

(34)

we solved these equations for a wide variety of parameters which allow existence of
two attractors with equal values of the cosmological constant but opposite values of
z, in a hope to nd a domain wall solution of randall-sundrum type, with a  |r|

8

at large |r|. however, instead of that we always found solutions5 with a  |r|, see
one of these solutions presented in fig. 1.

one can show that this is a general result, which follows from the fact that, ac-
cording to [6], one has ijz = 2
3gijz at the supersymmetric critical point. consider,
for example, the case (r) = 3g1z, in eq. (34). the scalar eld trajectory can
approach the critical value at large r either from below or from above. the one from
above with the negative derivative of  requires that z, > 0 above the attractor.
the one from below requires that z, < 0 below the attractor, whereas the attractor
point corresponds to z, = 0, therefore the second derivative of the central charge
is positive, z, > 0. since we consider the situations where gij > in the attractor,
equation ijz = 2
3gijz implies that the right critical point has a positive central
charge z. then equation a = +z implies that a approaches a constant positive
value at large positive r, i.e. a  |zcrr| + const, see fig. 1. if we would have used
the second pair of equations, staring with (r) = 3g1z, we would nd that at the
right critical point z is negative, but in this case a = z and again a > 0. the
case when ijz = 2
3gijz = 0 would lead to a = 0 and is also ruled out. thus
it follows from supersymmetry that the interpolating solution which admits killing
spinors at large positive r behaves as a  |zcrr| + const at large |r|. this is not an
interpolating domain wall of [13] as was already observed in [10].

in [17] a non-supersymmetric choice of z was suggested in the framework of
supergravity equations.
in this way a smooth solution modeling branes with the
desired asymptotic of the interpolating solution was obtained. one can verify that the
choice of the function z in [17] is such that z,  z at the critical points z, = 0.
this condition cannot be valid in a supersymmetric theory where ijz = 2
3 gijz at
the critical points and the moduli space metric is positive. this example conrms
that solutions a  |r| require violation of supersymmetry in this class of theories.
until now we were looking only for supersymmetric interpolating solutions, and
found that they do not behave as a  |r|. one may wonder whether one can
nd more general, non-supersymmetric interpolating solutions with the desirable
asymptotic a  |r|. the answer to this question is also negative.
indeed, the
relevant equation of motion for the interpolating scalars in the background metric is

 + 4a +

g,
g

!  + 6g1p, = 0 ,

(35)

where at the critical points p, is positive. let us assume that the solution of this
equation asymptotically approaches an attractor point cr at large r > 0, so that g
and g, become constant, a becomes negative constant, and  gradually vanishes
at large r. then the deviation  of the eld  from its asymptotic value cr at large

5according to eq. (32), the solutions with a  |r| tend to the large u , i.e. to uv, whereas those

with a  |r| tend to small u , i.e. to ir.

9

|r| satises the following equation:

  4|a| = 6|g1p,| .

(36)

this is equation for a harmonic oscillator with a negative friction term |a|.
solutions of this equation describe oscillations of  with amplitude blowing up at
large |r|, which contradicts our assumptions. this argument shows that there are
no interpolating solutions in our theory with a  |r| at large |r|. this conclusion
remains valid even if one relaxes our assumption that the scalar eld metric is positive
and considers domains with g < 0.

finally, we would like to note that even though we called the eld conguration
shown in fig. 1 interpolating solution, its physical interpretation requires further
investigation. indeed, even though the solution for the scalar eld  smoothly inter-
polates between the two attractor solutions, the function a(r) is singular. it behaves
as log |r| at |r|  0. metric near the domain wall is given by

ds2 = r2dxdx + dr2 .

(37)

this implies the existence of the curvature singularity at r = 0, which separates the
universe into two parts corresponding to the two dierent attractors.

4. we would like to point out that the existence of several basins of attraction in
dynamical systems in general is quite common. typically the system is attracted to
the nearest attractor point after it reaches a given basin of attraction. the new result
established in this paper is that there are conditions when more than one critical
points in supersymmetric attractors are physically acceptable, i.e. the moduli space
metric and the gauge couplings are positive. the system may be at some initial value
of a moduli either from one side of the discontinuity of the moduli space metric or
on the other side. this gives a precise denition of the basin of attraction. note
that the value of the entropy (or the value of the cosmological constant) in general
is dierent for two critical points under discussion:

thus, with respect to black holes, our analysis seems to develop and conrm the idea
suggested by moore [7] that the black holes (in d = 5, under some conditions specied
in this paper) may represent a multiple attractor system. to specify a black hole
one has to specify not only the charges and the prepotential but also the attractor
point, dened by the values of moduli at some distance from the horizon. however,
to fully understand the issue of the possible non-uniqueness of the black hole entropy
one has to study the black hole solutions and not only the critical points. we hope
to investigate this in the future.

with respect to ads5, we have shown that the critical points for the cosmological
constant correspond to a multiple attractor system. one of the most interesting issues
is related to the z2-symmetric bps critical points with equal values of the ads5 radius
found in this paper when a = 0. our investigation of the domain wall solution in
gauged supergravity [5] with one vector multiplet shows that for the non-compact
5-th dimension the asymptotic form of the interpolating solutions is always e|zcrr|,
which has an opposite sign compared to the randall-sundrum scenario [13, 10].

the main result of our paper is that multiple basins of attraction are possible
in supersymmetric theories. we found double-attractor systems with positive scalar
and vector metric in d = 5 one-moduli theory. we expect that in theories with
many moduli in d = 4 as well as in d = 5 one may also nd physically acceptable
congurations with multiple basins of attraction.

figure 1: a solution for the scalar eld  interpolating between two dierent vacua with
equal values of |z|. note that (r) is nonsingular because of the vanishing of g1 at  = 0,
whereas z and a are singular: z  r1 and a(r)  log |r| at |r|  0. at large r the
function a(r) grows as |r| rather than decreases as |r|. this is a general property of
interpolating solutions in our class of models.
