abstract

we study the emission rates of scalar, spinor and vector particles from a 5

dimensional black hole for arbitrary partial waves. the solution is lifted to

6 dimensions, and the near horizon bt z  s3 geometry of the black hole
solution is probed to determine the greybody factors. we show that the

exact decay rates can be reproduced from a (1 + 1)-dimensional conformal

eld theory which lies on the boundary of the near horizon geometry. the

ads/cft correspondence is used to determine the dimension of the cft

operators corresponding to the bulk elds. these operators couple to plane

waves incident on the cft from innity to produce emission in the bulk.

i. introduction

the study of the near horizon geometry of certain black holes has led to a better un-

derstanding of the origin of entropy and hawking radiation from an underlying conformal

eld theory [15]. the near horizon geometry corresponds to anti-de sitter space with or

without certain identications and is associated with a conformal eld theory which lives on

the boundary of the anti-de sitter space. the cft obtained thus carries non-trivial infor-

mation about the black hole space-time. in this paper we concentrate on studying emission

rates of particles from a ve dimensional black hole and give a derivation of the rates using

the conformal eld theory which is associated with its near horizon geometry. the black
hole solution is obtained by compactifying type ii b string theory on t 4 s1. on retaining
the s1 as a compact direction with a large radius, it gives a black string solution wrapped
around the s1. the near horizon geometry of this conguration is bt z  s3 where the
bt z black hole is 3-dimensional anti-de sitter space with certain identications [6]. we

observe that the emission rates of neutral particles obtained in the black string background

are the same as that from the 5-dimensional black hole [1,7], and the near horizon bt z

geometry has a crucial role in determining the greybody factors [810]. we thus study the

matter elds obtained as perturbations of the given 6-dimensional supergravity background

and obtain the equations of motion of particles in the near horizon geometry, by considering
a ads3s3 compactication of the six dimensional supergravity. since bt z space is locally
ads3, to study the equation of motion of particles it suces to study ads3  s3 compacti-
cation. the particles in 6 dimension are expanded in terms of the harmonic functions on s3,

and higher partial wave objects appear as massive excitations on the btz spacetime. we

separately study the behaviour of scalar, fermion and vector particles of the 6-dimensional

n = 8 sugra spectrum. the fermions and vectors considered here are non-minimally

coupled in six dimensions . we look at arbitrary partial waves for the particles and the

greybody factors are calculated by studying the wave equations in the near horizon geom-

etry and matching it suitably with the wavefunctions in asymptotically at spacetime at a

2

distance r  l from the horizon, where l is the ads3 radius.

the equation of motion of a minimally coupled scalar near the black hole horizon reduces

to the equation of motion of a massive scalar eld in the btz background. by solving

this equation of motion, as well as the equation of motion in six dimensions, far from the

horizon, we match the wavefunctions at an intermediate region and determine the greybody

factor. the latter agrees with the greybody factor obtained for arbitrary partial waves

in [11]. the greybody factor calculation for non-minimally coupled fermions for arbitrary

partial waves agrees with the result found previously in [12]. here, the matching of the

wavefunctions is non-trivial, as we have to solve the wavefunctions in three separate regions,

near intermediate and far to obtain the greybody factor. the vector gauge elds have not

been dealt with previously, and the emission rate calculation is thus a prediction for the

ve dimensional black hole. the near horizon sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) symmetry imposes some
interesting restrictions on the one forms, which we exploit to obtain the solutions of the

vector equations of motion.

next we replace the entire near horizon geometry of black string solution by an eective

1+1-dimensional cft which lies at a nite distance from the horizon, i.e. at r  l  r1r5.

here l is a measure of the size of the near horizon geometry, and r1, r5 are related to

the charges of the black hole. a quantum mechanical calculation of the emission rate is

done where a plane wave excites the operators of the cft. the correlators of the cft

operators are determined by the ads/cft correspondence according to the prescription

given in [1320]. unlike the other calculations of the emission rates, [10] where the ads

bulk solution couples to the operators, here it is the partial wave components of the plane

wave which couple to the cft operators and excite the cft. the quantum mechanical

calculation using the correlators with their proper normalisation constants reproduces the

emission rates exactly.

in the next section, to x our notation we review aspects of the six dimensional com-
pactication to bt z  s3. we determine the fermion and vector equations of motion on the
three dimensional black hole background, and obtain the expression for the masses due to

3

the orbital angular momentum of the particles. in the third section, the equations of motion

for scalars, fermions and vectors are solved and the greybody factors are determined. in

the fourth section we determine the dimension of the operators which couple to the above

particles and the corresponding correlators with the exact normalisation. the emission rates

are then calculated by exciting the operators using plane waves which are incident on the

cft. the last section concludes with a discussion.

ii. five dimensional black holes and their near horizon

geometry

the black hole solutions of string theory that we will consider arise from the low energy
eective action of type iib string theory in 10-dimensions, by compactifying on t 4  s1.
the full 10-dimensional metric is given by [2,21]

and f5 are given by:

f1 = 1 +

r2

, f5 = 1 +

r2

r2

.

the resultant black hole metric in 5-dimensions after kaluza-klein reduction has six

parameters, r1, r5, r0, , v [volume of the t 4] and r [length of the s1]. in the case of the

black hole obtained by wrapping q5 d-5 branes, q1 d-1 branes with momenta n along the

1-d brane the three charges of the black hole viz. q1, q5, n can be re-expressed as:

r2

r2
5 = gq5 ,

the black hole horizon is at r0. the non-zero eld strength in this background is given by:

where , .. run over t, x5, r coordinates and a, b, c denote the angular directions. the metric

(1) has the interesting property that in the near horizon limit r  r0 and in the so-called
dilute gas approximation r1, r5  r0, rn, it can be split up into three parts,

ds2 = ds2

bt z + ds2

(4)

is the metric of a (2 + 1)-dimensional bt z black hole, which is a solution of einstein
equation in 3-dimensions with a negative cosmological constant  = 1/l2 [6]. we have
made a coordinate change r2 = 2  2
 to get the above metric. the coordinate , the
parameter l and the horizons of the btz black hole  are related to the 5-dimensional

black hole variables and parameters by the following relations:

 = x5/l

, + = r0 cosh  ,  = r0 sinh  ,

l2 = r1r5 .

(5)

the part ds2

t 4 is just the metric on the 4-torus and ds2

s 3 is the metric on the three sphere

with a constant radius l. the btz metric includes time, the periodic x5 direction and the

radial direction of the 5-dimensional black hole.

the above decomposition forms the basis of the approach we are considering, in which all

thermodynamic properties of the black hole will be attributed to the non-trivial bt z part.

similar decompositions can be done in the case of black holes in other spacetime dimensions

[22,23]. the relevant near horizon part of the metric thus preserves sl(2, r)  sl(2, r)
symmetry which is absent in the full ve dimensional geometry. in fact as shown in earlier

cases, the equation of motion of the particles in the ve dimensional black hole background

show this symmetry near the horizon. the inclusion of the extra direction x5 does not

5

aect this property, since the extra dimension is a killing direction and does not change the

symmetries of the equations of motion.

by compactifying the 10 d metric on t 4, the black string solution in 6d is probed.

this is a solution of n = 8 supergravity in 6-dimensions. in d = 6 , n = 8 supergravity

theory, the spectrum consists of 40 fermions apart from 5 anti-self dual, anti-symmetric

gauge elds, 16 vector elds, 25 scalar elds and 8 rarita-schwinger elds. out of these,

as seen in (2), only one of the anti-symmetric gauge eld strength is non-vanishing apart

from the metric background. there is a so(5, 5) global symmtery which gets broken due to

the black hole background to so(4) so(5). we look at certain particles in the spectrum,
namely the minimally coupled scalars and non-minimally coupled fermions and gauge elds

in 6d. the scalars correspond to gravitons along the t 4 direction. the scalars satisfy
ordinary klein gordon equation in 6d, and on compactication on ads3 s3, are expanded
as  = p (t, r, )y (l0), where y (l0) are spherical harmonics on s3. the equation of motion

for scalar elds for the partial wave l on s3 satises the massive klein-gordon equation

[2  m 2] = 0

in the ads3 spacetime with the mass  given in terms of l as [24,25]

m 2 =

1
l2 l(l + 2)

in the above p are related to the kinetic term of the scalars, f a
m n p is related to the three

form eld strength, f  
m n are related to the eld strengths of the one form gauge elds.
now we study the compactication of this theory to ads3  s3. from (2) it can be seen

6

that that the non-zero background elds, the three form eld strength is given in the near

horizon limit by; h a

 = (1/l)a5 and h a

bcd = (1/l)bcda5 where , , ... etc indicate the

three ads directions and b, c, d... are the s3 directions. this gives the required equation
r = 1/l2(gg  gg) for the ads3 directions and rbcde = 1/l2(gbdgce  gcdgbe) for
the s3. next, we factorise the fermion eld  in terms of an undetermined function of the

bt z coordinates, times the harmonic functions on the three-sphere. we also work in the

representation where (5) = . in this linearised approximation, the resultant expression

is:

m dm  

1
12

hm n p m n p  = 0

(8)

the expansion in harmonics of s3 is of the form  = p (p,1/2)y (p,1/2), and obey
/y (p,1/2) = (p + 1)y (p,1/2), where p is a half integer, labeling the spin representa-
tion. plugging in this expansion in the equation of motion (7), and using the decomposition

of 6-dimensional m matrices into 3-dimensional ones as given in [25], the two-component

equation takes the form

d +

1
l

((p + 1)  1)  = 0

where (p,1/2) = , which can be written as:

(cid:18) +  +

1
l

[l + 1/2](cid:19)  = 0 .

(9)

(10)

where p = l + 1/2, and we have chosen one of the eigenvalues of the spherical harmonic

(choosing the other sign gives l+1/2+2 for the mass term). the spin connections correspond

to btz spacetime. note that, here l stands for the orbital angular momentum, and in [9],

the calculations were done for l = 0. from the above it also follows that the lowest mass

term in the bt z space time is non zero and equals 1/2. this is our basic set of equations

for the determination fermionic of the greybody factor. it is interesting that on plugging

the three dimensional spin connections and using the relations (5), it can be shown that

this equation is the same as that of the fermionic uctuations in the background of the

7

5-dimensional black hole in the near horizon limit [12]. we conne ourselves to particles

without any kaluza-klein momentum along the compact direction x5. in other words, the

particles belong to the s-wave sector with respect to the bt z black hole. inclusion of the

azimuthal quantum number along x5 will imply charged fermion emission in ve dimensions.

similar decomposition can be made for the vector equations of d = 6, n = 8 supergravity
into ads3  s3. the exercise has been done in [27]. note that this vector couples to the
threeform, and hence its linearised equation of motion reduces to:

(12)

wher we have dropped the indices (l,1). these set of equations correspond to a massive
gauge eld in the btz background, and we solve for this to get the required greybody factor.

iii. greybody factors

in this section, we solve the scalar, fermion and vector equations of motion of the previous

sections to nd the absorption cross-sections of the black hole for these particles. since we

study particles of various spins, a newman-penrose formalism would have been ideal for the

study of particle propagation on the btz background. however, this has not been developed

in three dimensions, and we separately consider the various equations of motion and nd

the solutions in the near horizon and in the asymptotic regions.

a. scalar greybody factor

the scalar greybody factor for arbitrary partial waves for the ve dimensional black hole

was found in in [11]. here, we exploit the near-horizon (bt z) geometry of the black holes to

8

solve the scalar wave equations. as stated before, the massless scalar wave equation for an

arbitrary partial wave l in the 5d background can be reduced to the massive klein-gordon

equation in the btz background. this equation was solved for the massless case in [8].

from (6) and (4), we we get the massive s-wave scalar equation in bt z background:

(16)

setting the coecients of the 1/z and the 1/(1  z) terms to zero, as required by the
continuity with the solution very close to the horizon [28], the above equation reduced to

the familiar hypergeometric equation

z(1  z)

(17)

thus, the nal solution is:

(18)

(19)

and we have substituted m 2 = l(l + 2)/l2. the ux of particles into the black hole can be

calculated from the formula

f0 =

f0 = 4l2+

(20)

(21)

now to nd the incoming ux at innity, we have to solve the wave equation at very

large distances from the black hole, where space time is almost at. the corresponding wave

equation is solved in the six dimensional black string background, with the metric given in

eq.(1), with r  . the solution is expanded as p (r)y (l0), where the y (l0) are the
spherical harmonics on s3. using 2y (l0) = l(l + 2)y (l0), where 2 is the laplacian on
the s3, the radial equation of motion follows:

#  = 0

having the ingoing bessel solution:

 =

r

(ajl+1(r) + bnl+1(r))

(22)

(23)

the asymptotic expansions of the bessel functions yields the following ux at innity:

f = 2h|a|2 + |b|2 + i(ab  ba)i

10

(24)

since the far solution should smoothly go over to the near horizon (btz) solution, we

investigate the nature of the solutions near the region r  l, till which region we assume that
the ads3 geometry is a good approximation to the black hole spacetime. from eq. (5) and

the dilute gas approximation, near r  l  r0 sinh , we get   r and hence the angular
parts of the wavefunctions are the same. thus, we simply compare the radial wavefunctions.

the intermediate region is obtained by setting z  1 and r << 1 in the hypergeometric
and the bessel solutions respectively to obtain the matching condition [29,30] :

a = n l/2(l + 1)(l!)2(cid:18) 2

(cid:19)l+1

()

(  )(  )

.

(25)

where n = 2

 = r2

0. the other constant b is much smaller by factor of (n2)l, and

+  2

hence is neglected in the subsequent calculations.

a interesting point to note is that if we solve for the scalar wavefunction in the asymptotic

ads space, the solutions are obtained as  = jl+1(l2/) + nl+1(l2/), and thus at

 = r = l, this has the exact polynomial behaviour as the at space wave functions as the

arguments of the bessel functions both reduce to l. although we do not use the scalar

wave functions in asymptotically ads3 space to determine the greybody factor, it would

be interesting to check whether the above observation has a deeper signicance, since the

location r = l has no apparent physical signicance.

the greybody factor is then evaluated using standard methods of calculation of ab-

sorption crossections by taking the ratio of the uxes. thus from (21), (24) and (25), the

greybody factor is:

and we have included the plane wave normalisation factor 4
3 (l + 1)2. we have also used the
identity |(1  ix)|2 = x/ sinh x. the above expression for the greybody factor reduces
to the area of the black hole for l = 0 , t  t+ , and   0 [31].

b. fermion greybody factor

we shall solve the equation of motion of the fermions equation (10) on the btz back-

ground,

in a suitable set of coordinates. we dene 2 = 2

x = t/l   and assume the following form of the wavefunctions:



1,2 =

where (1, 2) refer to the two components of the spinor. the spin connections for the bt z-

metric are:

2(cid:19)  = 0 .

(27)

here we work in the representation, 1 = 1, 0 = 2, 2 = 3. then we dene a new set of

wavefunctions 

1,2 as

1 + 2 = (cid:16)1  tanh2 (cid:17)1/4q1 + tanh  (
1  2 = (cid:16)1  tanh2 (cid:17)1/4q1  tanh  (

whence the dirac equation assumes the form:

where we have dened y = tanh . next, we choose the following ansatz

,

12

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

where b1,2 are arbitrary constants z = y2 and f (z) are yet undetermined solutions. sub-

stituting in the dirac equations, separating the equations for 

1 and 

2 and demanding

continuity of this solution with the solution obtained very close to the horizon, we nally

obtain the following hypergeometric dierential equations for f1(z) and f2(z) :

in our subsequent calculations, we shall normalise b1 = 1. this solution is an exact solution

for the btz space time and it approximates the fermionic wave function near the horizon.

the ux into the black hole can be calculated using the   +, z  0 limit of this

solution. the ux of particles entering the horizon is

f0 = gj |+ = g e

11 .

(35)

substituting the above solutions it is clear that 

2 dominates the ux, and the latter turns

out to be

f0 = n (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(36)

now, to nd the incoming ux at innity, we solve the radial dirac equation in the 6-
0/r2  0. then the metric

where b stands for the s3 world indices and i the s3 tangent space index. now, in six di-

mensions the wavefunction is a four component chiral spinor. we start with the appropriate

equation of motion in 6d as given in (8). including all the terms, the equation of motion is:

with the i, j indices running over tangent space s3 indices only. the function

using the decomposition of  matrices into so(2,1) and so(3) parts we can separate

out the equation of the components of the 6d chiral wavefunction into two sets of two

to compare with the near horizon wave function solved in the x+, r, x coordinates, we have

to use the properties of the spinor under such transformations from t, r,  coordinates. this

gives a rotation on the two component wavefunction by a matrix :

[cosh  

2! + i sinh  

2! 2],

cosh /2 = + + /n 1/4 + +  /n 1/4 .

the near horizon solution, when extrapolated to z  1 (keeping the leading term in the

(58)

where

g =

([l + 3]/2 + i/4t+)([l + 2]/2  i/4t)

,

thus comparing with the intermediate solutions and then with the far solution using equa-

tions (49,52,55) we get:

(60)

where, we have used the fact that |(1/2 + ix)|2 = / cosh x and we have multiplied by
the appropriate plane wave normalisation [12]. the wavefunction corresponding to the s3

17

spinor y p,1/2 gives rise to a greybody factor with t+  t and vice-versa. hence the total
greybody factor is a sum of two terms, one due to each set of two component fermions.

c. vector greybody factor

the vector equation of motion is given in (12). the higher partial wave in ve dimensions

gives a mass term for the gauge eld in three dimensions. in addition, there is another set

of equations as given in [27] :

 
 a = 

l
l

a

(61)

this is derived from the representation theory of one forms on sl(2,r) manifolds. since the

btz space is locally anti-de sitter, whose covering group is sl(2,r) sl(2,r), the equation
of motion gets supplemented by the above. on substituting the above equation in (12), the

vector equation of motion reduces to (for convenience, we set the ads radius l = 1 in the

rest of this section) :

[a] = l2a

(62)

it is to be observed that (62), can now be derived from (61) by operating with  on both
sides. there is also the consistency condition :

a

; = 0 .

(63)

we would like to solve the above equations of motion in the background of the btz black
hole. in the coordinate system (, x+, x) that we had adopted previously, the + and 
components of (12) can be written as:

2a+ + (tanh   coth )a+ + 2 coth +a  2 tanh [a] = l(l + 2)a+
2a  (tanh   coth )a + 2 tanh a  2 coth [+a] = l(l + 2)a

(64)

(65)

where 2  g =  + ++ + , we have taken + = 1 and have used the
gauge condition (63). dening

18

a1,2 = a+  a

(66)

it is clear that the equation for a2 gets decoupled by adding (65) and (64). to decouple the

equation for a1, we use the equations (61) to substitute for the a terms in (64) and (65).

as a result, we get the following equations for the a1 and a2 (these set of equations can

also be derived directly from (62):

2ai + (tanh  + coth )ai = (l2  2il)a1 ,

(67)

where i = 1, 2 ,

1 = 1 ,

2 = 1. next, we substitute the solution

ai = eik+x++kx

ai() ,

which is consistent with the isometries of the metric. substituting in (67), and dening
z  tanh2  we get:

z(1  z)

continuity with the corresponding wave equations very close to the horizon (z  0) gives
harmonic solutions in log z of the form ai = ein
i ek2 log z. to obtain a ingoing

i ek1logz + eout

solution, we put eout

i = 0. to ensure that (70) smoothly joins with this, we determine m
and n and nd that the coecients of 1/z and 1/(1  z) terms vanish. the residual part
of (70) is simply the hypergeometric dierential equation. thus the functions fi(z) are the

19

hypergeometric functions f [ai, bi; ci; z] and the complete solution for the gauge potentials

can be written as

ai = eizmi(1  z)nif [ai, bi; ci; z]

.

we can express the various parameters in terms of k and l :

a can now be determined from the denitions (66) and the solution for a can be con-

structed from the -component of (61):

[+a]

(73)

the important point to note is that the two components ai satisfy equations which are scalar

equations in the btz background. the spin dependence of the solutions is not obvious. the

constants e1 and e2 are not independent by virtue of the auxiliary equations (61) and the

consistency conditions. to determine the ratio, we use the equation with  = + in (61).

 tanh  (a  a) = la+

(74)

on substituting a from (61), and going the z coordinates, the equation reduces to in terms

of a1 and a2 as,

e1"2bf (a, b + 1; c; z) + a  b

(a  b + 2kk1/l) (a  l)f (a, b, c; z)

from the above, the ratio of constants are now easily determined to be:

(79)

where k1,2  [k+  k]/2. plugging in this ratio of constants into the solutions and using
appropriate recursion relations, the wavefunctions can be written as

e2

a+ =

2b (1  z)l/2zilk+/2hlf (a, b + 1; c; z) + (l  ik+)f (a, b; c; z)i

a = 

(80)

(81)

in the above, the solution is actually the real part of the wave function determined

above. the ux of the vector eld at the horizon of the black hole is calculated using the

energy momentum tensor for the massive vector eld. since our wave function is re ai, the

energy momentum tensor which involves products of the elds will have the square terms

proportional to e2it and e2t. under time averaging, these terms go to zero, and hence

the steady rate of particle inux is given by cross terms :

t = 

1
4

(|f|2 + 2m2|a|2)g + ff  

 + m2aa


(82)

21

where m stands for the mass. for our purposes m2 = l(l + 2). to determine the ux, we

incorporate the red-shift factor and integrate over the horizon area to get:

, k+ = /(2lth), and we have restored the radius of anti-desitter space.

+  2

vanishes for l = 0, since the latter is a not a dynamical mode [27].

before determining the waveform at innity, we solve (62) in the asymptotic ads3 met-

ric in the coordinates (t, , )as an interesting exercise, as it sheds light on the boundary

behavior of the wavefunction in the btz geometry. the wavefunctions, ai = etbi are

solved, with the help of (61) as:

bi(x) = "ciji(

l2


) + dini(

l2


)#

(84)

where j and n are bessel functions of the rst and second kind respectively, 1 =

l 1 , 2 = l + 1 and ci, di are arbitrary constants. further, consistency with the equations
(61) requires that c1 = c2  c and d1 = d2  d.

to determine the wavefunction at asymptotic innity which joins with the btz wave-

function, we need to look at the vector equation of motion in six dimensions. as given in

eq. (11), the vector equation of motion involves all the other aa components which are

scalar in the t, r,  plane as well as the hm n p three form eld strength in six dimensions.

since we are interested in that part of gbf which is due to the three dimensional vectors,

we take n =  in eqn 11 and take the limit r  . the equation of motion reduces to:

f + afa = 0

(85)

where we have kept terms of o(1/r2). in six dimensions hm n p = ijkldlf5 where ijkl is the

at space epsilon tensor along the four non-compact directions xi, which gives the second

term in equation (11) to be order (1/r3) form (2) and hence can be ignored. in the gauge
m am = 0, we assume that a = aaa = 0. the main observation is that the aas

22

decouple in this gauge. for the wavefunctions a = eiteima

(r)/r3/2, the equation of

motion for the m = 0 case is of the form:

(87)

(88)

(89)

it is interesting to note that the wavefunctions determined here do not share the exact

polynomial nature of the wavefunction obtained in (84) at r =  = l, as in the case of

scalars. the reason behind this is that due to the loss of sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) symmetry,
the equations (61) are no longer valid for the asymptotic metric. thus the wavefunctions

match with each other only in leading order in r. let us nd the relation between the

coecients of the solutions (71) and (89) for which, we compare the two solutions in the

region z  1, and r << 1. using standard results for the behaviour of hypergeometric
functions as z  1, we nd the leading behaviour of the wave functions as [30]:

a+, a 

e2
2b

(n)l/2l(l)(c)

(a)(b + 1)

(90)

we match the solutions with the far region wavefunctions using the relation: atl = +a+

2(cid:19)(l+1)

(l + 2)(l + 1)e1

(91)

where e1 = (c)/((a)(b+ 1)). the other constants are negligible and hence ignored. the

solutions go as a

i  q1/2eir at large distances. the ux, determined from equation

(82) is:

f = 


2

l2|a1|2 .

23

(92)

taking the ratio of the near horizon and asymptotic uxes (83) and (92) and using the above

relations for the ratio of the constants, we nally get the probability of absorption of the

lth partial wave as

pl = f0
f

=

lk+2n l2l+1

l2+22l(+  )2((l + 2)(l + 1))2|e1|2

(93)

this is the general result for the partial wave l.

it is clear that the evaluation of the

gamma-functions will give rise to the familiar form of the greybody factor with thermal

distribution functions corresponding to two incoming particles and one outgoing particle.

the latter always is always associated with a bose distribution function, as can be seen
from the relation |(c1)|2 = |(1 + /2th)|2 = (/2th)/ sinh(/2th). however, the
nature of the ingoing distribution functions depend on the value of l that one considers.

in particular, on substituting the values of a and b from (72) in p, we nd that the the
gamma-functions in the numerator correspond to fermi distributions for odd-l and bose

distributions for even-l. thus, depending on the partial wave, the vector particle can be

thought of arising out of the interactions of two bosons or two fermions.

the greybody factor or the absorption coecient of the black hole is determined by

multiplying by the plane wave factor as:

abs =



2ln l+2
(l!)422l
sinh /th



2l

l2+th(+  )2
|(l/2 + i/4t+)(l/2 + 1 + i/4t)|2

(94)

if we include rest of the components of the six dimensional vector, i.e. aa, then the total

gbf will involve a sum of the individual greybody factors. the greybody factors due to aa

are same as that of the scalars. since those terms do not contain the spin dependence, we

ignore them.

iv. cft description

the decay rates are obtained from the above greybody factors by multplying with the

appropriate planck or fermi-dirac distributions. it has been known for long that the these

24

decay rates can be reproduced form a cft calculation using appropriate conformal opera-

tors. earlier, the dimensions of the cft operators were guessed from the structure of the

decay rates [32,33]. however, using the ads/cft correspondence, the dimension as well

as the exact correlators with correct normalisations can be determined using prescriptions

given in [1316,20]. here we rely on the correspondence to determine the correlators. we

note that the near horizon approximation of the black holes can be used at most till r  l.
though the near horizon metric will receive corrections as r approaches l, we ignore them

in this region. the correlators are determined in poincare coordinates for convenience.

the poincare coordinates are related to the btz coordinates by the following relations:

w =   2  2
2  2

x0 =   n

the metric in poincare coordinates is:

ds2 =

x2

0 (cid:16)dx2

0 + dw+dw(cid:17)

the klein-gordon equation on this background can be written in the following form:

#  = 0

substituting:

the solutions which are ingoing or regular at the black hole horizon are:

k(x0) = ax0kl+1(kx0) .

(95)

(96)

(97)

where, k = 4k+k and a is an arbitrary constant of integration. to determine the correlator

corresponding to the above scalar eld and look at the bahavior of the wavefunction at r = l,

which implies x0  r0/l  0 in the dilute gas approximation. the boundary of the ads eld
is taken at x0 =  where  is innitesimally small and set set k() = 1. the action is:

i =

lim

(99)

on using (97) in the above, and using the solutions for k(x0), the action (fourier component)

consists only of the boundary term at x0 = . the fourier component thus is:

the leading non-analytic term has a ln(k) dependence. we keep the coecient of the term

components of  are:

(103)

on specifying one of the components at x0 = , the other component also gets related to it.

using the above solutions, and substituting in the boundary term of the action, one fourier

component is read as:

lim
x0

(k + k)

~k.

k

kl(kx0)
kl+1(k)

taking the expansion for kn as given in equation (100), and keeping the coecient of the

2l+1 ln  term, the greens function in the fourier transformed space is read o as:

gf (w, w) = (l + 1)

( ~w  ~w).
| ~w  ~w|2(l+2)

(104)

where  stand for spinor indices. the correlator has also been determined in [18].

to nd out the correlators for the cft operators corresponding to the vectors, it is

useful to employ the methods of [16,19]. we solve the vector equations in ads3 space, in

poincare coordinates. the equation of motion for a0 = r d2wei~k. ~wa0 and ai = r d2wei~k. ~wai

the equation for a0 is easily solved as a0 = a0x0zl(kx0), where k2 = 4k+k. for k2 > 0,

zm(kx0) = km(kx0) (modied bessel function of second kind) and for k2 < 0, this is

zm(kx0) = jm(kx0). however, since we conne ourselves to euclidean metric, we choose

the former solution. the other two components are easily separated using equation (61).

the solutions for the two components are:

a = ax0kl1(kx0)

(107)

the use of (61) also leads to a relation between the constants a

is, which implies, that only

one can be xed independently by boundary condition. the other arbitrary constants are

related to it, and hence are determined. thus only one component of ai can be xed at

27

the boundary, and hence the classical source is actually chiral. the ratio of constants are as

follows:

a = a0

k
k

(108)

this obviously implies that a+/a = k+/k. also, the function a falls slower than a+,

and hence we specify a at the boundary. the other components then get related to it.

the expression for the action is:

i = z d2wdx0

using the solutions obtained above, one fourier component of the action evaluated at a

distance  is :

i = (k + k)

kl+1(k)

kkl1(k)
k+kl+1(k)

on using the expansion of (100) we nd:

we now calculate the emission rates from the conformal eld theory theory. the quantum

mechanical calculation involves modelling the entire black hole spacetime by a cft at the

boundary of the near horizon geometry r  l. this is in accordance with the ads/cft
correspondence, as the information about the near horizon bt z  s3 is supposed to be
encoded in the boundary of the btz space. a plane wave is taken to be incident on

the black hole , which couples with the operators of the cft in the region r  l. the
emission rate due to this excitation is calculated using the results for ordinary stimulated

emission. the incident wave is regarded as classical, while the cft operators are treated

as quantum. the plane wave has to be expanded in spherical waves, to get out the partial

wave components. the plane wave is expanded in terms of spherical functions as:

eikx = xl0

22(l + 1)

er
(r)3/2 ezl,0(cos)

(115)

the spherical wave, near r = l goes as rn0(, t) (where n is an integer depending on l). it

couples to the cft operator as r d2x0o.

to determine the dimension of 0 under conformal transformations, we look at the be-
haviour of the wave function at r  l. the part of the wave function which goes as rn
comes from contribution of j(r) which is analytic in the region we are considering. for
the scalars, the wavefunction near r  l goes as rl0. as on the boundary, the theory is
invariant under conformal transformations, 0 should have a denite behavior under trans-

formations which can be scalings like ds2 = f 2(r)(ds2). here the coordinates scale like

f (r) and the wavefunction scales like  = f lrl

0. since  is a scalar, 0 has to scale as

f l. which gives it a dimension of l. accordingly, the coupling r d2x0o implies the

dimension s = l + 2 for the operator o. this is consistent with the correlator determined

earlier.

for the fermions, the two components of the wave function do not fall o in an identical

manner, and the eigenstates of 1 (which is the chirality matrix for two dimensions) ,1+2 =

+ falls slower than 1  2 =  as given in equation (49). so for our purposes, we take

29

+  0. for

 = (1/r)1/2l 0(t, )

and we get the fall o power of  as  = l  1/2. since the fermion is a scalar under
transformations r = f (r)r, 0 has the dimension of l1/2 under this transformation, which
is like a conformal transformation in the boundary metric. hence by conformal invariance

of the term r d2x0o, the dimension of o is f = 2 +  = l + 3/2. the operator 0 is

a spin 1/2 object under the group so(2, 2), and hence, o is also spin-1/2, but of opposite

chirality. hence, the left and right conformal weights are determined as h + h+ = l + 3/2

and h  h+ = 1/2, thus

h = l/2 + 1, h+ = l/2 + 1/2 .

this is the same as that appears from the correlator calculation given above.

as for the vector eld, it is immediately observed, that the two separable components at

the boundary, a1,2 = at  a/l, correspond to left moving and right moving sources in the
boundary. the fall o in powers of r is dierent for the two components and the case we

are considering, and as seen from earlier section, a1 falls slower than a2, and hence a2  0.
the fall o in a1 is as follows:

a1 = rla0(t, ) .

since under the transformation r  f (r)r, a1 transforms as a covariant vector, the di-
mension of a0,  = l  1. thus a0 is a source for the cft operator ov with weight
v = 2 + l  1 = l + 1. the left and right weights can now be determined as

h = l/2 + 1,

h+ = l/2 .

all the weights determined above are same as those predicted using group theoretic methods

in [27].

we are now ready to compute the emission rate due to the plane wave-cft coupling

r 0o. if due to this interaction term, the state in the cft undergoes a transition, |ii  |fi,

30

then, the transition probability for this process is:

wf i = |0|2| hf| o |ii |2(f  i  )

where f , i are the energies at of the initial and nal states of the cft. the above can be

written as an integral over the two coordinates of the boundary, and in case the nal state

is not a unique state, we sum over the nal states which gives:

t = xf z d2xeitdi|eiitoeif t|fehf|o|ii|0|2 .

if the initial state is the poincare vacuum, then the transition probability is:

t = z d2xeitd0|o(t)o(0)|0e|0|2

(116)

essentially we need g(w, w)|0|2 to complete the calculations. for 0 we use the form
of the plane wave solutions at r  l as determined in section iii. however, as these have
been determined in btz coordinates, we use the conformal dimension of these when we

use poincare coordinates.

in eect, p

0 = (2t+w+)h+1(2tw)h1(nl2)h++hbt z

0

.

an additional power of (nl2)h++h = (42tt+l4)h++h enters, since in btz coordinates,

coordinates x(h++h)

we assume that the wave function scales like rh++h at the boundary and in the poincare
. (x0 = n /r at the boundary, and we use l to make the scalings in
both the coordinates dimensionless) using the fact that t = (1/4t+) ln w++(1/4t) ln w,

0

we get the integral in the transmission coecient to be:

i = z dw+dw (w+)i/4t++h+1(w)i/4t+h1

(w+  1)2h+(w  1)2h

where we take the initial

w = e2t(t)

at the origin of the btz coordinates. the range of w is from 0 to . changing from
w  w, and using b(x, y) = r 

0 dt tx1/(1 + t)x+y, the integral can be done:

i =

(2h+)(2h)

1

e/2th|(h+ + i/4t+)|2|(h + i/4t)|2

31

the emission rate is evaluated as:

(2l2t+)2h+1(2l2t)2h1|0|2ci

where c is a normalisation constant, which includes the plane wave normalisation. plugging

in the correct normalisation for each of the correlators, and using the appropriate 0, the

emission rates are exactly same as the semiclassical calculations. for the scalars, 0 =

1/(l+1)!(/2)l+1. using this, as well as h = h+ = l/2+1, the relation that 4l42t+t =

n,and multiplying by the appropriate factor to get the plane wave normalisation, we get

the emission rate as:

s
cft = 2n

(n2)l
22l(l!)4

exp(/2th)



 | (l/2 + 1 + i/4t+)  (l/2 + 1 + i/4t)|2

(117)

a comparison with equation (26), shows that the semiclassical calculation has been repro-

duced exactly. there is an alternative derivation for the s-wave emission in [34].

for the fermions, the wave is chosen to be of a given chirality, and hence in the expression

for the emission rate, 0 = l+3/22(l+1)/(l + 1)! with h = l/2 + 1, h+ = l/2 + 1/2, the

emission rate is determined as:

f
cft =

(l + 1)2(l + 2)(2l2t)l+1(2l2t+)l

4(l + 1)!2(l + 1)(l + 2)

2(cid:19)2l
(cid:18)

 e/2th | (l/2 + 1 + i/4t) (l/2 + 1/2 + i/4t+)|2

(118)

using the expressions for the temperatures, it can be seen that the above expression exactly

matches that obtained in equation (60) after multiplying by the fermi-dirac distribution,

1/(exp(/th) + 1). the special case of s-waves for t  t+ was obtained in [35]. the
gbf for the other set of two component wave functions in six dimension can be obtained

by the same procedure above, but now with h+ and h interchanged.

for the vector coupling, we retain the component of the wave function which falls slower

as a function of r at r  l. this couples to the operators on the boundary. hence for the
vector 0 = at + a = 1/(l + 1)!(/2)l+1. this along with h = l/2 + 1, h+ = l/2, yields

the emission rate as:

32

(119)

this is same as eqn (94) multiplied by the planck distribution with temperature th. thus

we see for each of the cases stated above the matching is exactly obtained. it is interesting

to note how the various factors conspire among themselves to yield this exact matching,

using the ads/cft correspondence.

v. discussions

in this paper, we have studied the emission rate for particles for arbitrary partial waves

by probing the near horizon geometry of a 5-dimensional near extremal black hole. we

determined the greybody factors of scalars, spinors and vector particles by solving their re-

spective equation of motion in the btz back ground and matching them with wavefunctions

obtained at large distances from the black hole. for fermions, the matching was non-trivial,

and we solved the equation of motion in an intermediate region; r  l. the answers ob-
tained for the scalars and spinors reproduced the results obtained previously for the ve

dimensional black hole. our calculation for non-minimally coupled vector particles is the

rst calculation for emission rates for the given conguration.

next, we used the conformal eld theory at the boundary to obtain the quantum me-

chanical spontaneous emission rates. this is in the spirit of the ads/cft correspondence,

in which all information regarding the bulk degrees of freedom are entirely encoded in the

degrees of freedom at the boundary. indeed, we used the various 2-point functions which

have been calculated from the ads/cft correspondence to nd the decay rates, and the

latter perfectly matches with the semi classical hawking radiation rates, for all partial waves.

33

the asymptotic plane waves that excite the cft near r  l carry non-trivial kinematical
information and inuence the spontaneous emission rate. thus our calculation shows how

the ads/cft correspondence can be successfully used to predict the emission rates from

black holes. the exact matching suggests that the thermodynamical properties of these

black holes are holographically encoded in the boundary cft.

it is to be noted that the cft is at a nite distance from the horizon, and the role of

the horizon degrees of freedom are not very clear, unlike the cft determined in [36]. also

the thermodynamics of non-extremal black holes like the schwarzschild black hole remains
unaddressed, as the near horizon bt z  s3 geometry emerges only for near extremal black
holes.
