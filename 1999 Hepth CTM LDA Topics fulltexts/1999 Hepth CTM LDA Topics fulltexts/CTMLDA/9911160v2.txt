abstract

in the present paper we study s(n )  s(u (n/2)  u (n/2)) symmetry
breaking in n = 4 sy m via ads/cft correspondence. we consider two
stacks of n/2 parallel d3 branes separated by a distance 2~d.
in this case
there is mixing between the dierent l-wave dilatonic kk modes. we calculate
certain the two point correlation functions in the dual gauge theory. due
to mode mixing, the diagonal correlation functions have 1/n conformal-like
correction as well as deformation terms. the o-diagonal correlators are also
nonvanishing and their leading order is 1/n . we discuss briey the spectrum
of the glueball exitations.

1 introduction

a recent development in the understanding of the string theory was a conjecture by
maldacena [1] according to which, in some appropriate low energy limit, there is a
duality between n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory and type ii strings on
adsd+1m background. this is nothing but a manifestation of the old ideas [6],[7]
involving the deep connection between gauge theories and strings. therefore, from
this point of view it is clear that many problems in large n gauge theories can be
studied via supergravity in ads spaces3. the precise meaning and the explicit rules
for relating ads supergravity and the type iib string theory were given in [2] and [3].

namely, the explicit from of the correspondence between the correlation functions
of the operators in conformal eld theory (cft) living on the asymptotic conformal
boundary of the d + 1 dimensional anti-de sitter space and type ii supergravity
action evaluated on the classical solutions i was proposed to be:

hexpzs d

i

0oiicf t = exp(cid:0)s[i](cid:1)

0 = i

where ois are conformal operators in cft and i
|ads is the boundary value
of the classical solutions which serve as a source for the primary operators in cft.
the proposed correspondence has been examined in a number of calculations of the
correlation functions of operators in cft using the classical solutions of various
elds from the spectrum of ads supergravity. these, even incomplete proofs of the
validity of the holographic principle, supply us with a powerful tool for studying
strongly coupled gauge theories. most of the intensive investigations of ads/cft
correspondence however are for the case of supergravity in pure ads background,
i.e. at the origin of the moduli space where there is an enhanced superconformal
symmetry and many problems can be managed exactly even at strong coupling.

departure from the origin of the moduli space means allowing scalar elds to have
non-zero expectation values and therefore to move to the coulomb branch of the
theory. the vacua in the coulomb branch are maximally supersymmetric but some
of the gauge symmetry is broken by the expectation value of scalar elds. these cases
correspond to certain solutions of the supergravity eld equations in which the bulk
space geometry approaches ads near the boundary, but diers from it in the interior.
from holographic correspondence point of view such geometries are related either
to a relevant deformation of the conformal eld theories, or to existence of states of
the cft with vacuum expectation value which sets the energy scale. in a recent
paper by klebanov and witten [4] a more general investigation of the symmetry
breaking is given and applied to several examples. there are recent papers studying
the coulomb branch of the gauge theories in four dimensions [14, 10, 11, 8, 9] which
are based on continuous spherically symmetric distributions of large number of d3
branes. they, in fact, extend the results of [12, 13] by investigating dierent probes
in the bulk of the ads space and their holographic images on the boundary. since
the eective background is asymptotically ads5  s5 one can expand the elds in
spherical harmonics and solve the supergravity equations of motion for the kaluza-
klein (kk) modes. in this case, due to spherical symmetry of the distribution of
the d3 branes the dierent kk modes decouple, thus enabling one to nd exact
solutions of the eld equations using ads/cft correspondence to obtain the two

2

point correlation functions.

in the present paper we will consider the simplest example of two stacks of equal
number coincident d3 branes separated by a distance 2~d, which corresponds to a
vacuum state of the gauge theory where the gauge su(n) symmetry is broken to
s(u(n/2)  u(n/2)) by the expectation value of scalar elds.
in section 2 we consider the supergravity solutions in the presence of two center
d3 brane geometry and the reduction of the 10 dimensional dilaton action to ve
dimensional one by integrating over the spherical harmonics.
it turns out that
the equations of motion for the dilatonic kk modes are coupled. this coupling
modies the two-point correlation functions, which we nd and discuss in section
3. the diagonal correlation functions of the operators on in the gauge theory
receive 1/n correction to the conformal-like part which is the eect of the coupling
between the dierent modes.
in contrast to the conformal case and the case of
uniformly distributed d3-branes the correlation functions of hon(~x)on+2(~y)i (in our
approximation) are nonvanishing and they start with a 1/n term. in addition all the
correlators have a deformation term which, after a wick rotation, possesses a pole
structure. we interpret the double poles as a degenerate spectrum of glueballs. all
these questions are subject of consideration in section 4. we summarize, interpret
and comment on our results in the concluding section.

2 two stacks of d3 branes: equations and solu-

tions

let us consider the case of two center d3 branes .
in this case, a large number
n of d3 branes are separated into two parallel stacks of n/2 branes each. their
separation distance introduces a energy scale in the theory. the su(n) gauge
symmetry is broken down to s(u(n/2) u(n/2)). from the gauge theory side this
corresponds to higgsing of the gauge theory by scalar elds:

~x = ~d1.i

0

0

~d2.i!

(1)

where i is (n/2) (n/2) identity matrix and ~di - the position of the i-th stack. let
us parametrize the moduli space in terms of gauge invariant elds as in [15, 3]:

oi = c i

i1...ik t r(cid:0)x i1 . . . x ik(cid:1)

3

(2)

i1...ik is totally symmetric traceless rank k so(6) tensor and x is are as in
where c i
(1). the higgsing gives expectation values of the chiral operators oi 4 which can
be expressed in terms of order parameters di [4, 15]:

to describe the correlation function on the coulomb branch let us start with ten

dimensional type ii supergravity in the two-centered d3 brane background:

|~y  ~d2|4!

(3)

(4)

in (4), ~y are the normal coordinates to the branes 5. since it is always possible
to make an appropriate shift in ~y-direction, we will choose the origin so that ~d1 =
~d2 = ~d and therefore:

h =

l4

|~y + ~d|4

|~y  ~d|4!

(5)

using this choice one can expand it in a taylor series:

where y 2l =p c 2l

let us now consider the kinetic part of the 10d dilaton action:

s

(7)

4we call these operators chiral in the sense of [15]
5it is clear that at large r the space is asymptotically ads5  s 5. since we consider the large

n case we have neglected the irrelevant constant in h. l4 = 4gs 2n .

after integration by parts the above action takes the form:

one can substitute for the dilaton eld its expansion in s5 scalar spherical harmonics

where r = |~y|, and to obtain ve dimensional action in the background (3), we
integrate over s5 . as it was noted in a number of papers (see for instance [16]),
we have an innite tower of kk modes i and there are no fundamental physical
reasons to truncate. the resulting boundary action takes the form:

and therefore is irrelevant for our considerations.

the kinetic term can be easily reduced to ve dimensional eective action in the

since the metric possess two dirent forms in the regions of r < d and r > d
we will have two systems of equations - one for each region. taking into account

the expression for h (6) and the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics (with

in the above expressions we used the following notation:

al,i,j = a(l, i, j)hc lc ic ji

(24)

and a(l, i, j) and < c lc ic j > are as in eq.(16). we see that the equation for the
dierent kk modes of the dilaton eld n are coupled. in general, according to the
ads/cft correspondence, the operators oi are mapped to conformal uctuations in
the metrics of ads5 and s5. in our case this implies that the dilaton action projected

7

on the boundary will produce correlation functions of the operators oi  tr (f 2x i).
in contrast to the uniformly distributed d3 branes case, there is coupling between
the dierent kk modes, which signals a nontrivial contribution to the corresponding
correlations functions. the mixing between the kk modes means that, due to the
fact that we have broken conformal symmetry the sources coming from gravity
solutions will produce in general mixed correlation functions. we will see how it
happens in the next section.

the eld equations in the two regions can be transformed into bessel equation

where all the derivatives are with respect to  and  respectively. exact solutions
to (26) and (28) are dicult to nd. for small d and large n however, they allow
perturbative treatement. one can see that the right hand sides of the both systems
are readily expanded in 1/2 (1/2 = d2/l4 and l4 = 4gs2n) so we will proceed
with obtaining the zero and rst order solutions in 1/2.

let us consider the zeroth order approximation. the solutions of the homoge-

neous system for r > d are:

fn( , ~k) =( in+2( )

kn+2( )

n = 0, 1, . . .

and therefore the general solution for the dilatonic modes is:

n() = 2hkn+2()(0)

n (~k) + in+2()(0)

n (~k)i

where (0)

n (~k) and (0)

n (~k) are yet to be determined coecients.

(29)

(30)

the solutions in r < d region are:

fn(, ~k) =( in+2()

kn+2()

n = 0, 1, . . .

(31)

or, taking into account that  = 1/:

n(




) = 2(cid:20)kn+2(




) (0)

n (~k) + in+2(




)(0)

n (~k)(cid:21)

(32)

in general, our solution must be regular in the interior of ads space so that the
solutions for r > d must be extended in r < d region to a regular solution. the only
regular solution in this region is:

n(




) = 2in+2(




)(0)

n (~k)

(33)

9

in addition, the two solutions (30) and (33) must be matched on the boundary of
the two regions ( = 1):

n(cid:18)
(cid:19)|=1
(cid:19)(cid:21)
(cid:20)n(cid:18)

|=1

= n()|=1

= [n()]

these conditions uniquely determine the coecients (0)

n and (0)

to determine the last unknown coecient (0)

n note that the scalar eld near the

where qb(~k) is the boundary value of q and  is the spectral parameter in the
equations of motion. applying the above formula to the n-th dilatonic kk mode
and using the behaviour of the bessel functions of small argument, one can see that
the only contribution to the above behaviour comes from kn+2 and therefore:

with this, all the coecients in the zeroth order solutions are completely determined.
we subsitute the zeroth order solutions on the right hand side of (26,25)and (28,27)

as for the zeroth order solutions, (1)
n () are determined by the boundary data.
there is however an important dierence - these coecients are determined by
(~k). the solutions for n-th dilatonic kk
a linear combination of n
mode contain two as yet undetermined coecients, but they can be determined by
the matching conditions on the boundary of the two regions. we will see later that
these coecients will play an important role in interpreting the correlation functions
and therefore on the physics of the coulomb branch.

to conclude this section let us summarize the results we have found.
starting from 10d dilaton action in 2 stacks d3 brane background we found
equations of motion which are coupled for kk harmonics. the expansion with
respect to the small parameter 1/2 allowed us to treat this complicated system
perturbatively. we found solutions up to rst order correction terms. by matching
conditions for the solutions for r > d and r < d for each n and the asymptotic
properties of the solutions we determined all the coecient functions.

3 correlation functions

as mentioned in the introduction, two stacks parallel d3 branes in transverse di-
rections preserve supersymmetry, since the poincare supersymmetries of the gauge
theory are maintained but superconformal invariance is broken by the higgsing. in
the case under consideration, the su(n) symmetry is broken down to s(u(n/2) 
u(n/2)). this will modify the correlation functions which we study in this section.
from the gauge theory side, according to ads/cft correspondence, evaluation
of the action on the classical solutions will produces the correlation functions of
i1...ikx i1 . . . x ik). as
shown in the introduction, the nontrivial contributions will come from the terms of
the following form8 :

we have to impose on the rst order solutions the matching conditions (34,35) on
the boundary of the two regions ( = 1) (note that these are imposed now on the
rst order solutions). after tedious but straightforward calculations we nd the
following expression for (1)

having completely determined these coecients, we simply have to subsitute the
explicit form of our rst order solutions in the boundary term action and to take
the limit   0. to see which terms survive this limit, we must use the expansion
of the bessel functions for small argument. after some lengthly but straightforward

calculations we nd the following expression for the diagonal correlation functions
in momentum space (as usual we have omitted the terms of even integer powers of
k since they produce in the position space -function and its derivatives):

since we have mixing between the dierent kk dilatonic modes, the o-diagonal
correlation functions are also nonvanishing. we nd for them the following expres-

besides the conformal-like parts (integer powers of  times ln k) the correlation
functions contain deformations coming from the coecient functions (1)
entering
the solutions. substituting the expressions for (1)
into the boundary action and
keeping the terms that survive   0 limit one can obtain the deformation functions
dn,m. to simplify the nal expressions we introduce the following notations:

in the above we have used that l4 = 4gs2n and the deformation of the conformal
part dn,m( d
it is well known that
on  tr(f 2x n).
in contrast to the case of spherically symmetric, continuously
distributed d3-branes, the mixed correlators are nonvanishing. keeping the rst

l2|~x  ~y|) is the fourier transform of dn,m().

16

order terms in the solutions we have found that the correlation functions contain
1/n corrections. the leading term in the mixed correlators, which comes from the
rst order solutions, is proportional to 1/n. one can see directly from the explicit
form of the correlation functions that in the conformal limit d  0 (or equivalently
< x > 0) the 1/n correction term vanishes (the deformations dn,m also vanish).
in that limit the mixed correlation functions also vanish and the conformal symmetry
will be restored.

let us recapitulate the results found in this section. the physical picture that
emerges in our study of separated two stack d3 brane background is qualitatively
dierent from the case of continuously distributed d3 branes. as expected, due
to the broken conformal symmetry, the correlation functions of the boundary sym
theory in its coulomb phase have terms which vanish in the conformal limit. there
is a deformation term much like in the case of spherical d3 brane shell and conformal
like correction which is of order 1/n. this correction does not appear in the case
of uniformly distributed d3 branes. futhermore, due to interaction between kk
modes, o diagonal correlators are nonvanishing and are of order 1/n. all deviations
vanish in the conformal limit.

4 deformation terms and the spectrum

in the previous section it was shown that the correlation functions on coulomb
branch have deformation terms. schematically they have the following form:

dn,n()  (c1)n,n() + (c2)n()n2,n() + (c3)n()
dn,n+2()  (c4)n,n+2() + (c5)n,n() + (c6)n+2n,n()

where the coecients ci can be read o from the explicit form of dn,m and as before:

n,m() = (1)

n,m() + (2)

n,m()

in the above formulae we have separated n,m into (1)
n,m, the part containing in the
denominator a product of one bessel function and it derivative, and (2)
n,m which
contain in the denominator square of a bessel function times its derivative. we note
also that n contains in the denominator in+2i 

n+2.

in order to analyze the structure of dn,m we perform a wick rotation ~k  i~k.

one can use the transformation properties of the modied bessel functions:

i(ik) = ei 

2 j(k)

17

k(ik) =

i
2

ei 

2 [j(k) + in(k)]

to obtain the relevant expression for the case of minkowski space time. since the
expressions are rather complicated we will analyze only their denominators. from
the above formulae, one can see that there are two kinds of poles. simple poles come
from the zeroes of:

jn+2()j 

n+2() = 0;

or jn+2()j 

n+2jn()j 

n() = 0

(66)

and the other kind poles - from the zeroes of

[jn+2()j 

n+2()]2 = 0

therefore we have double poles in the deformation functions. we interpret these
as describing the spectrum of glueballs with double degeneracy. it is reasonable to
expect that the two stacks might introduce some degeneracy in the spectrum since
they contrubute identically to the boundary. the spacing between the dierent
resonant frequences is given in units of l2
d . it is interesting to note that we obtain
the same resonant frequencies as in the case of d3 brane shell, but these are double
poles corresponding to a double degeneracy. however the resonances are sharp.
one possible way to resolve this puzzle, as proposed in [9] is to consider eect of
absorption by the branes which introduces nite width to these resonances. it would
be very interesting to study the stability of these resonances and their eventual decay
into gauge bosons, but this question is beyond the scope of the present paper and
we address it to future research.

5 conclusions

in the present paper, we have studied the coulomb branch of sym theory using
ads/cft correspondence. our considerations are based on the simplest example of
two stacks of n/2 parallel d3 branes separated by a distance 2d which break su(n)
symmetry to s(u(n/2)  u(n/2)). inspite of its apparent simplicity the problem
has turned out to be complicated but interesting. this complication mainly comes
from the coupling between dierent n-wave dilatonic kk modes in the equations of
motion. these equations are solved in the leading (1/n) order. we have shown that
the coupling between kk dilatonic modes causes the appearance of mixed correlation
functions which are of order 1/n. according to ads/cft correspondence principle,
the operators on correspond to tr(f 2x n). it is obvous from the explicit form of

18

the correlation functions that in the conformal limit (d  0, or higgss vev tends to
zero) both - 1/n term in the diagonal correlators and the mixed correlation functions
vanish.

all the correlation functions have also deformation terms. the analysis in the
phase space, after a wick rotation, shows that these functions have a resonant
structure - double poles at appropriate resonant frequencies. we interpret these
double poles as the degenerate spectrum of glueballs.

it will be interesting to study the correlation functions beyond this level of ap-
proximation. we expect more conformal-like terms to appear in the correlations
functions. we also have also to learn more about the spectrum of the glueballs and
to look for a mechanism of deriving more realistic masses.

6 appendix: the particular solutions of (40).

in this appendix we will nd the particular solutions for the rst order equations
of motion. we have, in fact, to nd particular solutions for three cases:

n ( ) +
f 

1
f 


n( ) (cid:18)1 +

(n + 2)2

let us consider the following expression:

2in( )
2in+2( )
2in+4( )

n = 1, . . .

(67)

2 (cid:19) fn( ) =

h ( ) (cid:18)1 +

1


dnh  h  +

(n + 2)2

2 (cid:19) h( )

since the right hand side of eq. (67) contain bessel functions times powers of  it is
instructive to consider the function h of the form:

h = aim( )

(68)

19

after simple transformations and using the bessel equation for im we nd:

dnh = a2h2ai 

m +(cid:0)a2 + m2  (n + 2)2(cid:1) imi

if we substitute for i 

m in the above equation:

i 

m = im+1 + mim

we nd:

dnh = a2h2aim+1 +(cid:0)(a + m)2  (n + 2)2(cid:1) imi

let us choose the parameters a and m in the following way:

a + m = n + 2

therefore:

dnh = nm+12(n  m + 2)im+1( )

for m = n  1 one nd:

(74)

to solve the second case one can use the properties of the bessel function in+2:

in+2( ) = in( )  2(n + 2)in+1( )

and therefore:

2in+2( ) = 2in( )  2(n + 2)in+1( )

using the above we have the solution for the second case.

to obtain the solution for the third case instead of eq. (70) one can use the

following property of bessel functions:

i 
m( ) = im1( )  mim( )

20

then we will have:

dnh = a2h2aim1 +(cid:0)(a  m)2  (n + 2)2(cid:1) imi

let us choose:

(75)

with this choice we nd:

a = m  n  2;

m = n + 5
