abstract

the nite gauge transformation, in the submanifold of su(3) introduced
in hep-th/9902027, is found to be linear in the gauge functions as. in this
manner, a parameterization of su(3) in terms of a single real octet vector
a is achieved. under this nite transformation, those gauge elds satisfying
 b = 0, remain unchanged. a geometric meaning to the submanifold in
dab
terms of subgroup of rotations in e8 is presented.

in a recent paper [1], dealing with the infrared region of qcd and con-
nement, su(3) gauge eld congurations appropriate to the infrared region
of qcd have been proposed. these congurations, motivated by the works
of thooft [2] and mandelstam [3] on the crucial roles of monopole congu-
rations in connement, are dened by

dab

 b = a + f acb ac

 b = 0,

(1)

where, the eight components a of an eight dimensional vector are chosen to
satisfy

aa = 1,

dabc b c =

a.

(2)

now, the manifold relevant to the infrared region of qcd is not the complete
su(3) manifold spanned by arbitrary as, but a submanifold spanned by
those as satisfying (2) and the relevant gauge eld conguration aa
 are

been found to be

(3)

where c is an arbitrary vector eld. further it has been shown that
such congurations when used in the usual qcd action contains magnetic
monopole congurations necessary for connement and connement has been
realized as in the london theory of meissner eect, along the lines suggested
it has been stated in [1] that in view of (1), a mass term

olating gauge symmetry, as a gauge variation of this term 2m2(aa

in the submanifold dened by (2).

the purpose of this short note is to show this result of innitesimal vari-
ation holdsgood for nite gauge transformations as well. the nite gauge
transformations here become linear in as. the second relation in (2) upon
using the rst relation becomes dabcabc = 1
3. it is known [5,6] that
aa and dabcabc are the only two su(3) invariants. the submanifold
is thus one in which these invariants are taken as constants unity and 1
3
respectively.

consider a gauge transformation generated by

2 ! ,
u = exp ia a

(4)

for s satisfying (2) and as are the gell-mann su(3) matrices. we shall
make use of the basic relation for the - matrices, viz.,

ab = if abcc +

2
3

ab + dabcc,

(5)

where f abc and dabc are the usual anti-symmetric and symmetric su(3) ten-
sors respectively. expanding the exponential (4), we have

u = 1 + ia a

where  and  are (nite) complex constants. u1 can be easily found to be

(7)

thus, the nite gauge transformation u becomes linear in . this is a
special feature of the submanifold dened by (2). thus a parameterization
of su(3) in terms of a single real octet vector a is achieved by (6). it has
been shown by macfarlane, sudbery and weisz [5] that any special unitary
matrix u written as exp(ia) with a hermitian and a = aa, can be
written as u = u0 + iuaa, where ua = aa + bdabcbc, with u0, a, b as
functions of the two su(3) invariants, aa and dabcabc. in our choice,
these invariants are taken as constants 1 and 1
3 and this gives (6) for u. we
will relate this u to the rotation matrix of a subgroup of rotations in eight
dimensional euclidean space e8 at the end.

forms as

(8)

to check the notation and the factors, we nd the innitesimal version of (8)
is

(9)

as it should be. in view (1), aa
gauge transformations (6) with (7),

for those aa

we shall make use of the standard relations among f and d tensors [5],

viz.,

and

f imdmjk + f jmdimk + f klmdijm = 0,

f ijmf km =

3

(ikj  ijk) + dikmdjm  djkmdim.

(11)

(12)

starting from (6), we have

(u)u1 = (a)a( + bb)

= (a)a + i(a)bf abcc
+ (a)bdabcc,

(13)

where (a)a = 0, following from the rst relation in (2) is used. also,
the second relation in (2) gives

dabc(b)c =

1
23

(a),

(14)

and so

(u)u1 = ( +

1
23

)(a)a + i(a)bf abcc.

(15)

we are interested in the transformation of the aa
using (1) in (15), we have

s satisfying (1) and so

(u)u1 = ( +

1
23

)f abcbac

a

(16)

using (13) for simplifying f apqf abc, (16) becomes

(19)

in here there are fourteen terms. the sixth term and the third term are
like-terms; the seventh and the fourth are like-terms, and the fth and the
second are like-terms. the nineth term vanishes identically. in the thirteenth
term, the second relation in (2) is used. then we nd,

uau1 =

. (20)

now, the coecient of b terms in (20) is 2
3), which
is zero due to the second relation in (7). using the relation (12) to rewrite
the eighth term f adedbcd as f baddedc  f caddebd, the term involving f cad
vanishes due to the symmetry of ac in a and c. then the remaining of the
eighth term cancells with the sixth term in (20). in the fth term involving
f adef bcd, we make use of (13). then (20) becomes,

uau1 =

(23)

now, consider the terms involving two d-tensors. they are,

(dqbadpcapbaq

c + dabddecdacab

c).

by changing the summation indices in the second term above, viz., b 
q, a  b, c  p, e  c in that order, the two terms cancell each other.
then, the terms involving one d-tensor are,

dqcaaaq

c +

by rearranging the indices, this becomes,

( +  +

which vanishes due to the second relation in (7). now, consider the terms
involving one f -tensor. they are,

in the second term, make b  c, d  a so that the above expression becomes,

which vanishes due to the second relation in (7). finally, the terms involving

(24)

using the rst relation in (7).

thus when u = exp{ia a

2 } nite transformation is considered, u
becomes  + aa, linear in a in view of (2), with  and  satisfying (7).
this nite transformation leaves a invariant, for those aa
s satisfying (1).
therefore, within the submanifold dened by (2), the gauge elds satisfying
(1) can have a mass term, even for nite transformations.

it will be useful to consider the converse of this result. in order to this,
we ask the question: what will be the gauge eld congurations that remain
unchanged under nite gauge transformations? since under a nite gauge
transformation u, a transforms as,

a  au

 =

1
i

(u)u1 + uau1,

the answer is given by

a =

1
i

(u)u1 + uau1.

by right multiplying the above expression by u, we have

1
i

u + [u, a] = 0,

(25)

whose innitesimal version is (1). this means that for those as and u
satisfying (25), the mass term remain invariant.
in order to give explicit
expressions for aa
 and u, the transformation u is chosen by those s sat-
isfying (2). then (6) gives the required u. the choice of s satisfying (2)
and aa
 in (3) determined by (1), produce magnetic monopole congurations
in the qcd action [1].

it is known that the tensor indices taking eight values in d and f are
tensor indices associated with the adjoint group su(3)/z(3) of su(3). the
tensors d and f associated with su(3)/z(3), are cartesian tensors in eight
real dimensions [6]. given a single octet vector {a } and the tensors d and f ,
it is known that at most two linearly independent octets can be formed. they
are a itself and dabcbc. then at most two independent su(3) invariants

8

can be formed, which are taken as,

aa,
dabcabc.

(26)

a geometric meaning can be given to the invariants. if we associate a 3  3
matrix a with a as a = a a, where as are the gell-mann matrices,
then t r(a2) and det(a) give the above two invariants. in our choice made
in (2), we have taken the two invariants as constants.

a study of the relationship of the adjoint group su(3)/z(3) to the sub-
group of rotation group r8 which leaves invariant the length aa of the
real eight component vector a and the cubic invariant dabcabc has been
made by macfarlane [6]. here we will give the main results for our choice (2).
the eight components a can be taken to describe a point of e8. rotations
in e8 are real linear transformations

a  

a = rabb.

(27)

invariance of the length leads to rrt = i. we take det(r) = 1. to relate
su(3) to a subgroup of r8, the group of rotations in e8, associate with each
point in e8, a 3  3 traceless hermitian matrix a

a = aa,

(28)

an element of the algebra of su(3). transformations of e8 induced by
u  su(3) tansformation

a  a = uau1,

can be shown to give [6]

rab =

1
2

t r{a u b u1}.

for u in (6) and using the relations in (7), we nd explicitly,

rab = (1  )ab + 2ab 

+ ifabcc (  ).

3|betadabcc

(29)

(30)

(31)

it is veried that rabrac = bc, i.e., the transformation is orthogonal. it is
seen that rabb = a. thus the rotation leaves aa invariant. it is seen
that the invariance of dabcabc is veried by showing dabcraprbqrcr =
dpqr.

i am extremely thankful to biswajit chakraborty, ramesh anishetty and
