abstract

supergravities are usually presented in a so-called 1.5 order formulation. here we
present a general scheme to derive pure 1st order formulations of supergravities from
the 1.5 order ones. the example of n4 = 1 supergravity will be rederived and new
results for n4 = 2 and n11 = 1 will be presented.
it seems that beyond four dimensions the auxiliary elds introduced to obtain rst
order formulations of sugra theories do not admit supergeometrical transforma-
tion laws at least before a full supereld treatment. on the other hand rst order
formalisms simplify eventually symmetry analysis and the study of dimensional re-
ductions.

introduction

since the discovery of the central importance of u-dualities to control the
divergences of string theories [1, 2, 3] and of the duality between large n
super-yang-mills theory and ads compactication of eleven dimensional su-
pergravity [4] the need for a better conceptual understanding of the latter
has become rather urgent. the superspace approach is notoriously hard
but component approaches are rather cumbersome, this is unsatisfactory as
more miracles are being discovered [5]. finally the tensor calculus in 10 or
11 dimensions is strongly restricted by supersymmetry so it is important to
streamline the corresponding constraints for instance on allowed countert-
erms and nonperturbative eects [6, 7].

the purpose of the present manuscript is to pursue the investigation
of the general structure of supergravities in their rst order formalism. in
section 2, we will present a general method to derive rst order formalisms.
we will then treat the case of supergravities in general in section 3. the
exemples of n4 = 1, n4 = 2 and n11 = 1 will then illustrate the procedure,
sections 4, 5 and 6.

2 from 1.5 to 1st order formalisms

supergravity theories are conveniently written in a 1.5 order formulation.
it simply means that the lagrangian is a 1st order lagrangian, namely
the spin connection is to be varied as an independent eld, but on the other
hand its local supersymmetry transformation law is not required and usually
not known explicitly. the invariance of the action is only established after
extremisation over the connection [8].

the purpose of this section is to show a simple way to construct, from a
1.5 formulation, a 1st order formulation, namely, to give a local supersymme-
try transformation law for the spin connection, that leaves the lagrangian
invariant.

let l(a, i) be a rst order lagrangian, which depends on some dy-
namical elds a and on the auxiliary elds i (the spin connection in the
case of (super)gravity). the latter elds can be eliminated algebraically by
making use of their equations of motion, that is:

ei(, ) :=

l

i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= 0  i = i

2()

(1)

2

we used the fact that the lagrangian can be written (up to a surface term)
as an analytic function of i but not of its derivatives.

due to the analyticity of the lagrangian in the auxiliary elds, it is
2. dening i(, ) :=

possible to perform a taylor expansion around i
i  i

2(), we obtain2:

l(a, i) = l(a, i

2) +

ij

2

xij(a, i)

(2)

2+nl

ijk1 . . . kn(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=2

k1 . . . kn

(3)

where

xij(a, i) :=

2

(2 + n)!



xn=0

note that the term linear in i in the taylor expansion (2) vanishes iden-
tically due to (1).

let us suppose now that the actionr l(a, i

2) is invariant, as a 2nd order
functional, under a gauge symmetry, given by 2a = 2a(). our purpose
will now be to show that it is possible to dene a transformation law 1 that

extends this gauge invariance to the 1st order action 1r l(a, i) = 0. let

us rst dene 1a for simplicity by:

1a := 2a

(4)

we need now a transformation law for the auxiliary elds 1i which,
together with (4), leaves the 1st order lagrangian invariant. to proceed,
let us vary the equation (2) with respect to 1. using equation (4) and the
gauge invariance of the 2nd order lagrangian under 2, we nd that:

1l(, ) = 1  ij

2

xij! = ixij(cid:18)1j +

1
2

l x jk1xkl(cid:19) (5)

where x ij is the inverse of the matrix xij.

now, the 1st order lagrangian will be invariant under the variation 1 if
we impose the vanishing of (5) (up to some total derivative). this condition
is implemented if the transformation law of the auxiliary elds is taken to
be:

2we will use the einstein summation convention for the i indices (and not the de witt

one which includes spacetime integration).

1i = 2i

2

2

k x ij1xjk

(6)

this formula shows that the (1st order) transformation law for the auxil-
iary eld i is just the induced transformation law on i
2, plus a term which
vanishes modulo its equation of motion. this general result was presented
in [9], without the explicit formula (6).

in general, xij depends on i and some algebraic manipulations may
be necessary to extract 1i from equation (6). in the simple cases where
the lagrangian can be written (up to a surface term) as a polynomial of
degree 2 in the auxiliary elds3, i.e. l = 1
2 ijxij()  ixi() + x0()
(with xij(), xi() and x0() being arbitrary functionals of the remaining
dynamical elds and their derivatives), the above equation (6) reduces with
the help of (4) to:

1i = 2i

2() +

1
2

2 x ij()ej

(7)

this simple formula will be used in the following examples to nd 1st

order supergravities. it provides a rst solution to our problem.

sometimes however it is advisable to rewrite the transformation laws
by making use of a twist, that is, a trivial gauge transformation in the
terminology of [10] (see also [9]). in fact we can always redene:

1a
1i

:= 1a + aiei(, )
:= 1i  aiea(, )

or/and

1i = 1i + ijej

(8)

(9)

(10)

and similarly for the as.

then, 1 is still a gauge symmetry of the 1st order lagrangian (for any
ai and any antisymmetric matrix ij = [ij]). note that the trivial gauge
transformations (8-10) are just the simplest examples (which will be enough
for our present purpose). in fact, these formulas remain unchanged in the
de witt notation, ie with a spacetime integration in addition to the einstein
summation, see for example [10], [11].

3this will be the case for all the applications treated here.

4

this kind of twist will be used to simplify the form of 1a. the examples
of n4 = 1, n4 = 2 and n11 = 1 supergravities are treated in the following
sections. note that due to the symmetry of the matrix x ij (see the denition
(3)), the last term of equation (7) cannot be twisted away.

we would like to conclude this section by the following observation:
associated to a 2nd order formulation, there are an innite number of cor-
responding 1.5 order theories. this is due to the fact that the choice of
the auxiliary eld is somewhat arbitrary. in fact, it is straightforward to
verify that a redenition of the type i := i + f i(), where f i() is an
arbitrary function of the elds a and eventually of their derivatives, does
not change the associated 2nd order theory. in the case of supergravities,
there is a natural choice for the auxiliary gravitational connection which is
the supercovariant (hatted) connection (see below the origin of superco-
variance in 1.5 formalism). the same is true for the supercovariant hatted
eld strength, if any, as we shall see below.

3 the case of supergravities

the purpose of this section is to apply the previous formulas to derive 1st
order formulations for all supergravities from their 1.5 formulations. we
indeed give a general formula for the supersymmetry variation of the con-
nection for any supergravity in any dimension. explicit calculations will
then be given for the special cases of n4 = 1, n4 = 2 and n11 = 1 super-
gravities in the next sections.

3.1 generalities on supergravities

the bosonic elds of supergravities are generically the one-form vierbein
ea and eventually some (non)-abelian p-forms as. the auxiliary elds
associated to ea and to the as are respectively the one-form spin-connection
a
b and the (p + 1)-form eld strength f . our aim is thus to compute the
supersymmetry transformation laws for a
b and f using formula (7). this
equation shows that the relevant part of the supergravity lagrangian is the
one quadratic in the auxiliary elds. for any supergravity this is:

lsug(, , f ) = 

1
42 rab

ab

f  f + other

(11)

ccb and a1...ar := 1

where rab := dab+a
(see also [15] for notation and conventions). by other we mean the rest of
our supergravity action which is at most linear in the spin connection and
in the eld strength. here  denotes all the remaining elds, i.e. those of
the second order formalism.

(dr)! a1...arar+1...ad ear+1  . . . ead

as a consequence of equation (11), the euler-lagrange equations asso-

ciated to the spin-connection can always be written as:

2b() being not an independent eld but the

b = a

as the connection is an auxiliary eld, the rst equation (12) can be

algebraically inverted for d  3. in components, we nd that:

ab = m cd

(13)

3.2 the supersymmetry transformation law of the connec-

tion

the 2nd order supergravity lagrangian lsug(, 2, f 2) is invariant under
some local supersymmetry dened by its action on the non-auxiliary elds
namely 2. we derive now the supersymmetry transformation law of the
spin-connection for the 1st order lagrangian. the case of the eld strength
will be treated in the next subsection.

the method presented in the previous section to compute 1a

b from (7)
can be summarized as the following recipe: keep the part of the lagrangian
quadratic in the connection (namely the auxiliary eld). replace a
b by the
dierence a
b (dened after equation (12)) in this piece of the lagrangian.
then, impose the vanishing of its variation under 1. from (11), the only
part of the supergravity lagrangian which is proportional to the square
of the connection a
b comes from the purely gravitational einstein-hilbert
piece, namely a

ccbab. thus the previous recipe gives:

1(cid:16)a

ccb

ab(cid:17) = 0,

(14)

and then, using assumption (4),

1c
[a

b]c = 2c

2[a()b]c

[a

(15)

note that 1a
(13). the result is:

b can be extracted from (15) using the matrix m given in

t d

1ab = 22ab +

(ta,bc  tc,ab + tb,ca) ec

(16)

where we dened tc,ab := 2

 [a
b]cd.
of course, the above result can also be obtained straightforwardly from

b]d + tcab with t 

d2 c[a

ab := 2ed

 c

equation (7).

3.3 the supersymmetry transformation law for the eld strength

if the supergravity lagrangian depends also on some (non)-abelian p-form
a, we may wish to give a supersymmetry transformation law for the asso-
ciated auxiliary eld, namely the eld strength f . using equation (11) in
(5), this transformation law follows from (see also the recipe given in the
previous example):



1
2

1 (f f ) = 0

(17)

with f = f f 2, f 2() being the induced eld strength constructed from
the dynamical elds  (for instance f 2 = da + . . .) through the equation
of motion: lsug

= 0.

equation (17) gives the transformation law for f :

f (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)f =f 2

1f = 2f 2 + 2ea

iaf 

2e
2e

f

(18)

where ia denotes the interior product with respect to the vector eld e
a
(the inverse of the vierbein form ea = ea
dx) and e the determinant of the
vierbein.

to summarize: a 1st order formulation of any supergravity with a 1.5

order action is given by the transformation laws (4), (16) and (18).

7

3.4 some useful trivial transformations

it may be preferable to rewrite the transformation laws in a simpler form
by twisting them slightly. the transformation law for the gravitino can be
generically written as:

1  := d2 + more

(19)

where d2 is the covariant derivative constructed with the induced connec-
tion ab
2 and more is the remaining part of the supersymmetry transfor-
mation law, which does not contain any derivative of the transformation
parameter .

let us then dene a new transformation law for the gravitino (and for the
connection), which diers from (19) by a term proportional to the equations
of motion of a
b (12) (this makes the lorentz covariance more obvious with
d2  d, d being the covariant derivative dened by the connection a
b):

1  := 1   ab ab
4
1ab

:= 1ab + ab

= d + more

(20)

(21)

and 1(other elds) := 1(other elds).

here ab is the one form given as in equation (9). a direct way to
lsug
 ab 
= 0. using the equation of motion of the connection (12),

compute it explicitly is the following: ab has to be such that ab
ab ab
4

we nd that:



lsug


c

[ab]c = 

2
2

ab

lsug
 

(22)

this kind of twist may sometimes signicantly simplify the nal expression
for the connection transformation law.

finally, if the transformation law of the gravitino (19) depends on the
induced eld strength f 2, it is again possible to twist it in a similar way
by adding some trivial gauge transformation proportional to the equation of
motion of the eld strength. the net result would be the change f 2  f
in (19).

4 the 1st order n4 = 1 supergravity

as a rst example let us now derive (systematically) the old result of deser
and zumino [12] for the n4 = 1 supergravity in 4 dimensions. let us rst
use the general method of the previous section. that is, starting from a 1.5
formulation we will derive the connection supersymmetry transformation
law and improve it by adding a trivial gauge transformation. in the last
subsection we shall present a new method to obtain the same result in a
more straightforward way. we shall use this method in the next sections to
treat both the n4 = 2 and the n11 = 1 supergravities.

4.1 the lagrangian and the equations of motion

let us start with the 1st order lagrangian of n4 = 1 supergravity4 (as given
by the so-called 1.5 formalism):

l1 = 

1
42 rab

ab +

i
2

5(1)d

(23)

where (1) := aea, d := d + ab

4 ab with a1...ar := [a1 . . . ar]
and the denitions of rab and ab were given in the previous section. the
equations of motion corresponding to lagrangian (23) are:

1
42

rbc

bca 

i
2

5ad = 0

l1
ea =

42  c

l1
ab = 

i
2

5a a 

i2
2

a

!  = 0

i2
2

c

! abc = 0

(24)

(25)

(26)

with a := dea + a
b

eb.

note that the very last term of equation (25), namely  2

4 5a( a),

vanishes identically after a fierz rearrangement. it has been however added
to (25) to emphasize the vanishing of the sum of the last two terms after
making use of the equations of motion of the connection (26).

4the conventions are the following (see also appendix a): ab = {, +, +, +}, 0123 = 1,
= 11, 42 = 16g, g being

a are four real majorana matrices, 5 = 0123, (cid:0)5(cid:1)2

the newton constant.

9

4.2 the supersymmetry transformation law

the lagrangian (23) is invariant under local supersymmetry as a 2nd order
functional of ea and . that is, if we use the equations of motion of the
connection ab, the following transformation laws leave the action invariant:

2  = d2 = d  ab
2ea = i2a

2 (e, )

ab
4

(27)

(28)

a purely 1st order symmetry of supergravity is dened by 1ea := 2ea
and 1  := 2 , plus the supersymmetry transformation law for the con-
nection given by (15). using the fact that ab
2 identically satises equation
2 (ea, ) in a simple way. equation (15) becomes
(26), we can compute 1ab
after some algebra:

1c
[a

b]c = 

i2
2

where we dened,

cdabc  aab + bab + cab

(30)

(31)

(32)

note that we just found an explicit expression for 1c

b]c, which
can (always) be inverted (as equation (12)) in any spacetime dimension
d  3 using the matrix (13). finally, we see from (29) that there is no
term proportional to the derivative of the gauge parameter (namely d) in
the transformation law of the connection (in other words the connection
remains supercovariant). this is due to two facts:

[a

 the induced connection ab
2 (e, ) was in this case eortlessly super-
covariant, its supercovariance is still obscure though and it may seem
that it is a four-dimensional accident [8]; more precisely it is only in
four dimensions that one may require simultaneously the independence
of the connection and the absence of fermionic quartic terms in the
action, in fact here we shall always use the supercovariant connection
as the independent variable by using the freedom mentioned at the
end of section 2.

10

 the last term of the rhs of (15) (or of (16)) is also supercovariant
since it depends on  only through 2ea (which is independent of ,
see (28)).

we may pause at this stage to reect on the general structure of su-
persymmetry transformation laws. the anticommutator of two of them
gives a dieomorphism consequently one has the typical multiplet structure
(b, f, a) with b bosonic, f fermionic and a auxiliary ie nonpropagating
elds. their variations are schematically

b  f
f  a + b
a  f

(33)

(34)

(35)

if one insists on a geometrical approach one is led to replace the term
b by the lorentz connection in the case of the graviton multiplet but this
uses the equation of motion for the connection so rst order formalisms
and oshell supersymmetry algebra are somewhat antinomic.
(w. siegel
informed us recently that he has made progress on this issue).

nevertheless supercovariance is useful to compute the superpotential cor-
responding to the supersymmetry gauge invariance in 1st order formalism,
see [13].

at this point the denition of 1ab given by (29), together with (27-28)
provide a 1st order formulation of supergravity. it is however preferable to
add two trivial gauge transformations to simplify the previous expressions:

1. the last term of equation (29), namely c ab (32), can be eliminated. in
fact it corresponds to a trivial gauge transformation of the type (10).
this can be checked as follows: due to equation (12), we have that
1ab
abc. then, c ab contributes with
a term proportional to abab, which vanishes identically (the
connection is a one-form).

l1
ab =  1

22 ab1c

2. the second trivial gauge transformation was explained in subsection
3.4 through equations (19-22). it allows to rewrite the gravitino trans-
formation law in terms of the 1st order covariant derivative d (instead
of d2):

1  := d

1ab

:= 1ab + ab

(36)

(37)

11

the one-form ab is computed from (22) using the gravitino equation
of motion (25). after some rearrangement, we nd that:

c

[ab]c = i25[aeb]d +

i2
2

cdabc + aab  bab (38)

where aab and bab were respectively dened in (30) and (31).
the twisted 1st order supersymmetric variation of the connection is
then given simply by combining (21) together with (29) and (38):

1c
[a

b]c = i25[aeb]d

(39)

note that all the terms proportional to the equations of motion of the
connection (through ab), namely aab and bab disappear.
one nally recovers the old result of deser and zumino [12] after
inverting (39) using the matrix (13) (as for (12)):

1ab = 2i25(cid:18)(1)ab 

1
2

eaccb +

1
2

ebcca(cid:19) ,

(40)

where  = 1

2 d.

thus, the rst order formulation of n4 = 1 supergravity is given by the
lagrangian (23) and the locally supersymmetric transformation laws (28),
(36) and (40) (or in a less aesthetical way by (27), (28) and (29)). but
the relative simplicity of (40) (comparable to that of 2ab
2 (e, )) remains
mysterious.

4.3 a new method

our idea now is to formulate better the choice of the twist (trivial gauge
transformation) and then to rewrite the equation for 1ab. geometrically,
one would like to keep (28) and (36) and nd the 1ab of (40) in a more
straightforward and less surprising way.

let us begin with a general discussion: suppose that our lagrangian is

invariant under a gauge symmetry given by:

i = da

i

a + a 

i
a

(41)

12

where i is now a pi-form which goes for all the elds (even auxiliary) of
the theory.

moreover, we suppose that the theory is a rst order one, in the sense
i depend on i and di (and no more derivatives of

that i and ei := l
the elds). let us now dene the (d  1)-form:

then, the following identity holds (oshell of course):

w  := ai

aei

w 
i =
di .



i = 

i  ()pi d 

where



di (cid:16)j

ej(cid:17)

(42)

(43)

the proof is given in [14] (see also [11]). the point is now that the
identity (43) can be used to compute straightforwardly 1ab from 1ea and
1. before starting concrete calculations, we will comment on the general
meaning of equation (43).

there is a fundamental reason why (43) is a useful formula for computing
transformation laws. in fact, it is the lagrangian (covariant) version of a
standard formula of hamiltonian formalism. namely in the hamiltonian
formalism, a transformation law i can be computed from the charge q
and the symplectic structure ij by the following formula:

i = nq, iop b

(44)

where now i are phase space elds. the poisson bracket (pb) is dened
by the inverse of the symplectic structure by {, } := 



then, equation (44) can be rewritten as:

i ij

j .

q
i

= j j i

(45)

although (43) and (45) look dierent, they are in some way analogous.
first of all the lhs of (43) is nothing but the euler-lagrange variation of
the noether current j  (and so the local covariant version of q of (45)).
this is a direct consequence of the fact that j  = w  + du (u being
the superpotential) [15]. now, the rhs of (43) contains two terms. the
rst one, j
di ej
is antisymmetric in i and j and is a local version (non integrated) of the

di ej, corresponds to j j i of (45). in fact,
 



13

witten-crnkovic-zuckerman 2-form [16](see [14], [11]) times j. the sec-
ej, vanishes on-shell. it is not so disturbing
ond term, namely



di j

to nd such an additional contribution in our covariant formulas since it also
exists in the hamiltonian formalism; in fact, the equivalence between (45)
and the symmetry of the original action is only up to some identications
of the type  q = p. in our case, this kind of identications are part of the
equations of motion (1st order theories).

let us come back to our n4 = 1 supergravity and use the identity (43)
to compute the supersymmetry transformation law of the connection. first
of all, we will comment on the following points derived in previous sections:

 by using some trivial gauge transformation, it is always possible
to rewrite the supersymmetry transformation law of the gravitino in
such a way that it depends on the independent eld ab instead of
the induced auxiliary eld ab
2 (). the mathematical consequence of
this twist is that now  1
= 0 (see the denition (36)). that was
obviously false for 2  of (27).


ea


 the induced connexion ab
2 () has been chosen to be supercovari-
ant in the sense that its supersymmetry variation does not depend on
the derivative of the gauge parameter . in that case, the independent
connexion ab will also be supercovariant. this is a consequence of the
general result (15-16) (itself following rather strong hypothesis on the
gravitational kinetic term) and of the fact that both the supersym-
metry transformation law of the vierbein (28) and the trivial gauge
transformations (21-22) do not depend on the derivative of the gauge
parameter .

two conclusions followed:

1. there should exist some 1ab, which, together with 1  = d and

1ea = i2a, leave the supergravity action (23) invariant.

2. this 1ab does not depend on the derivatives of the parameter .

we are now ready to use the identity (43). from the previous discus-
sion, the gravitino is the only eld whose supersymmetry transformation
law depends on the derivative of . thus, the denitions (41) and (42) give:

14

w  = 

l1
 

replacing the equation (25) in the above expression, we compute:

w

(48)

using the known expressions for 1eb (28), 1  (36) (which do not de-
pend on the derivatives of the vierbein, see the rst comment above) and
the equations of motion (24-25), our expression becomes:



i

d5a +



dea (cid:18)1cd

so equations (47) and (49) (together with (43)) imply:



dea (cid:18)1cd

cd(cid:19) =

(49)

(50)

this kind of equation will reappear in a more complicated form in the
case of n4 = 2 or n11 = 1 supergravities, that is why we shall now investi-
gate it in general. let us denote by i the auxiliary elds, ei their associated
equations of motion and by x the deas (thus  stands for two spacetime
indices and one lorentz index). then, equation (50) can be rewritten as:

(cid:16)1iei(cid:17) = r

(51)

in our case, the equations ei are linear in x (that is, the equations
of the connection are linear in the derivatives of the vierbeins). the x
dependence can be expressed as ei = eix + ei0. on the other hand from
(50) one reads that r is independent of x. in that case, we can choose
1i to be also independent of x, and then (51) implies that:

1iei = r

(52)

we used the word choose because (51) determines 1i only up to some
trivial gauge symmetry of the type (10), which can eventually depend on

15

x. the important point is that 1i independent of x is consistent with
(50). the last step is to invert equation (52) to extract 1i. in our case,
this is possible because the indices i and  have the same dimension, namely
d2(d1)
. this is due to the fact that ab and ea are, in a covariant sense,

2

canonically conjugate elds.

thus, using the rst identity of (26), we can nd a solution for 1cd

(from (52)):

42

1cd

acd =

i

5ad

(53)

this last equation is equivalent to (39). this can be checked by wedg-
ing the above expression with eb and antisymmetrising in the a and b
indices. then, it can be inverted to extract 1ab. the result is of course
again given by (40).

this new method will be used in the following sections to treat the

n4 = 2 and n11 = 1 supergravities.

1st order formalism for n4 = 2 supergravity

contrary to the n4 = 1 case, there seems to be no published rst order
formalism for n4 = 2 supergravity. we will give it here.

5.1 the 1st order lagrangian

the lagrangian of n4 = 2 supergravity in d=4 dimensions depends on
the one-form vierbein ea, the associated one-form so(1,3) (spin) connection
b, two rarita-schwinger majorana spinor-one-forms the gravitinos a
a
(a = 1, 2 is the internal global so(2) r-symmetry index) and one abelian
one-form gauge connection, the photon a, and its associated eld strength
f . the 4-form lagrangian is given by5 [8]:

let us comment the above equations:

 the last term in the rhs of (56), namely  a, denotes the electromag-
netic energy-momentum tensor and is given6 by  a = 
(f (da 
ea
a  1

2 f )).

 the supercovariant derivative appearing in the gravitinis equa-
tions of motion (57) is dened by: da := da  
b(f aa +
f aa5)b, with f a := ieaf = fabeb and f a := iea(f ) =
(f )abeb. to compute the result (57), the following two identities are
useful:

ea (f g) =

17

a supercovariant derivative identity

i5(1) da = i5(1)da  i(cid:16)f + 5f(cid:17) a

bb.

note also that the last two terms of (57) vanish by making use of the
auxiliary elds equations of motion (59-60).

 the unique solution to the eld strength equation of motion, namely
f 2 = daa is the so-called supercovariant eld strength, in the sense
that its induced supersymmetry transformation law (see equations (61-
63) below) does not depend on the derivatives of the gauge parameter7
. if we eliminate the auxiliary eld f , we recover the so-called 1st
order formulation, where the gravitational part of the lagrangian is
really 1st order whereas the maxwell part is not.

 the bianchi identity and equation of motion for the u (1) gauge
eld read symmetrically: d(f 2 + a) = 0 and d(f 2  b) = 0. the
supercovariantisation term in the eld strength is dual to the fermionic
source in its equation of motion. both quadratic expressions in the
fermions should be rewritten (using the transformation rules given in
the next section) as part of supercovariant dierentiation.

5.2 the supersymmetry transformation laws

the 2nd order lagrangian which is obtained from (54) after eliminating the
auxiliary elds ab and f is invariant under the following supersymmetry
transformation laws:

2 a = d2a := d2a 
2ea = i2aaa
bab
2a = ia


2

b

ab( f 2aa   f 2a5a)

(61)

(62)

(63)

as before, the index 2 in the rhs of (61) indicates that the auxiliary elds

are the induced ones, namely d2 = d(ab

2 (e, )) and f 2 = da  a.

the purpose is now to extend the 2nd order supersymmetry transfor-
mation laws (61-63) to the 1st order lagrangian (54). to proceed, we will
use the new method presented in section 4.3. let us rst emphasize three
points:

7the same happens for the induced spin connexion as in the n4 = 1 case, namely it is

already supercovariant.

18

1. we can already give a 1st order formulation for the n4 = 2 super-
gravity by 1 a = 2 a, 1ea = 2ea, 1a = 2a (equation (4)) and
by equations (16) and (18) for the transformation law of the auxiliary
elds.

2. for our choice of action the induced auxiliary elds ab

2 and f 2 are
supercovariants, in the sense that their supersymmetry transforma-
tion laws (induced by (61-63)) do not contain derivatives of the gauge
parameter (i.e. no terms proportional to ).

3. there should exist some transformation laws 1ab and 1f which,

together with

1 a := da
1ea
:= 2ea
1a := 2a

(64)

(65)

(66)

leave the lagrangian (54) invariant (up to some surface term). in fact,
1 dier from the 1 (see the above point 1.) by some trivial gauge
2  ab and f 2  f in (61)) of the
transformations (which allow ab
type (8-9).

to compute simultaneously 1ab and 1f , we will use the identity (43).
first of all, these two transformation laws will dier from 2ab
2 and 2f 2 by
some terms which are proportional to  (and which vanish on-shell). thus
the gravitini are the only elds whose supersymmetry transformation law
contains terms proportional to . in that case, the (d  1)-form dened
by (42) becomes:

w  = a

l2
 a

(67)

using then the rst identity in (57), we can compute the following (d 

2)-forms:

i
2

a5ada 

i

da5aa  i

f
ea

aa

bb (68)

w 
ea =
w 
a

= id(cid:16)aa

b5b(cid:17) = id(cid:16)aa

b5b(cid:17)

(69)

19

following the identity (43), these equations have to be equal respectively

to



dea (cid:18)1i



l2

i(cid:19) and to



da (cid:18)1i



l2

i(cid:19), where i goes for all the

elds (even auxiliary). using now (56-58) together with (64-66), the pair of
equations (68-69) has to be equal to:

(68) = 

+

(69) = 1eb



df
dea

i
2

1 a5aa + 1a

dea (cid:18)1cd

f (cid:19)

da (cid:18)1cd



l2
cd + 1f 

l2

f (cid:19)

(70)

(71)

using now that df

dea = f

ea and the explicit expressions for 1ea,

1 a et 1a we get from the previous two equations:



dea (cid:18)1cd



l2
cd + 1f 

l2

f (cid:19) =

da (cid:18)1cd



l2
cd + 1f 

l2

f (cid:19) = iaa

b5 db + 1ea

1eb



f
eb

now the unknown quantities in the above equations are 1cd and 1f .
to nd them, we can remark that the pair of equations (72-73) is a special
case of (51), where now the variable x goes for dea and da and i for
ab and f . as in the n4 = 1 case, we see from (72-73) that ei and r
are respectively linear and independent of x. we can then choose 1i to
be independent of x (see discussion after equation (51)). in that case, the
pair (72-73) becomes after some algebra:



1
42

1bc

abc =

a5a da

1 (f )  1ea

f a = iaa

b5 db



i
4

a(cid:16)f bc  5f bc(cid:17) a

bb

abc

(74)

(75)

20

the last steep is to isolate 1ab and 1f from (74-75). the lhs and
the rst term of the rhs of (74) are analogous to the result (53) of n4 = 1
supergravity. then it can be inverted using the matrix (13), giving three
terms analogous to the deser-zumino ones. the second term of the rhs of
(74) is proportional to abc (as the lhs) and thus does not require any more
work:

1ab = 2i25(cid:18)(1) ab 

1
2

eac cb +

+i3a(cid:16)fab  5fab(cid:17) a

bb

1
2

ebc ca(cid:19)

(76)

where   = 1

2  d and f := 1

2 f .

to invert the second equation (75), we use the identity:  (f )eaf a =

 (f  eaf a), which can be proved straightforwardly, see also [11]. then
equation (75) implies that:

1f = iaa

b5(cid:16) db(cid:17) + 1ea

f a

(77)

thus, the 1st order n4 = 2 lagrangian (54) is invariant under the su-

persymmetry transformation laws given by (64-66), (76) and (77).

it is interesting to note that using the new method it is possible to nd
a nice formula for the supersymmetry transformation laws, in the sense that
they depend on the independent auxiliary elds (namely ab and f ) and
2 and f 2 or dea and da).
not on the induced auxiliary elds (namely ab
this aesthetical criterion was the motivation for looking for a new method
in section 4.3, and not simply stop with the general results (4), (16) and
(18). in the next example, namely the n11 = 1 supergravity, we will prove
that such an aesthetical result does not exist.

1st order formalism for n11 = 1 supergravity

6.1 the 1st order lagrangian

the ve basic elds of the 1st order eleven dimensional supergravity are

b, the
rarita-schwinger one-form  and the three-form tensor a = 1

we also dened (n) := 1

and conventions are the same as in the previous subsections, generalized

8note that (78) (whose gravitational part was rst proposed in [18]) diers slightly from
the original formulation of eleven dimensional supergravity of [19]: in fact (78) is just the
standard lagrangian reexpressed in terms of the new connection a
b. this connection, as
an independent variable, is not the independent connection of [19] but is shifted in such a
way that its induced value is what was called in that paper a
b. in this form, the equations
of motion of the connection (83) are automatically supercovariant, in the sense that their
supersymmetry variation (87-89) does not contain the derivative of the gauge parameter.
finally, l11 of (78) is a complete 1st order formulation, with the four form also treated as
an independent eld. we should emphasize that the use of a supercovariant connection is
a technical help not a fundamental requirement in this work.

where we also used the shorthand notation dened by (101).

some additional comments are needed:

 the lagrangian (78) can be rewritten (up to a surface term) in the
following suggestive form:

note that the # operation is up to a trace, a hodge-duality operator:
from the denitions, #a = (a + ebiab  2eaibb).

(1) (6)(cid:17).

 the supercovariant-hatted derivative was derived in [19] and is
given by: d := d  
122 (abcde + 8bcdea) eaf bcde. the equa-
tion of motion (81) can be computed only after making use of

a fierz rearrangement:
4(7)a( a)+(1)( (6))(6)( (1))+
(5)( (2))  (2)( (5)) = 0
a supercovariant derivative identity:
i8 d = i8d + i

2 (cid:16)(5)f + (2)f(cid:17) .

as usual, the last two terms in the rhs of (81) vanish if the equations
of motion of the auxiliary elds ab and f are used.

 we xed the action in such a way that the induced auxiliary elds
ab
2 and f 2 (computed as the only solutions of (83-84)) are superco-
variants, in the sense that their supersymmetry transformation laws

23

(induced by (87-89)) do not contain the derivatives of the gauge pa-
rameter . note however that we paid a price for this, namely we
changed the quartic fermionic terms which seem unavoidable beyond
4 dimensions for pure supergravities.
in the previous example the
graviphoton did also cause such a complication.

6.2 the supersymmetry transformation law

the lagrangian (78) is invariant in a 2nd order sense (ie after using freely
the auxiliary elds equations of motion) under the following supersymmetry
transformation laws:

2  = d2 := d2 +
2ea = i2a

2a =

i
2

(2)



122  (abcde  8bcdea) eaf bcde

(87)

(88)

(89)

as before, a 1st order formulation of eleven dimensional supergravity is
given by equations (87-89) (following (4)), and by equations (16) and (18)
for the auxiliary elds. in a more explicit way, these are:

1
1ab = i2(cid:16)c 2ab + a 2cb  b 2ca(cid:17) ec +
2
 (abc1...c4 + 24ac1 bc2 c3c4) f c1...c4

+

2

i3
72

(ta,bc  tc,ab + tb,ca) ec



(90)

where 2ab := d2[ab] and d2 is the 2nd order supercovariant derivative
constructed with the induced auxiliary elds, namely ab
2 and f 2, see (87).
moreover, the tensor ta,bc (which vanishes modulo the equation of motion
of the connection) was dened just after equation (16).

the transformation law for the eld strength can also be computed fol-

lowing equation (18). the nal result is10:

1f =

i
2

(2) d2 + 2ea

iaf 

2e
2e

f

(91)

10to nd the result (91), we need the following eleven-dimensional fierz identity:
 a = 0, which can be proved using the general for-
 for the rst term and 1 = ,

a  (1)a
mula (106) with 1 = , 2 =  and 3 =  (1)a
2 =  and 3 = a for the second one.

 +  (1)a

24

with e the determinant of the vielbein.

a 1st order formulation for the gravitational part of eleven-dimensional
supergravity was rst derived in [18], it did not treat however the four form
eld strength as an independent eld. it diers from (87-90) by some trivial
gauge transformation of the type (22) (to see how to proceed, it is enough
to follow the method given in section 4.2). we could also add another trivial
gauge transformation to replace the f 2 by f in (87), and then d2 by d.
the net result would be to add a contribution to (91) proportional to the
equations of motion of the gravitino.

it is not obvious at all that the nal expressions for 1ab and 1f
would be simpler or more geometrical after adding these trivial gauge
transformations. the question we would like to answer is thus to know
whether there exists some appropriate trivial gauge transformation, which,
added to (87-91), gives as nice a result as in the n4 = 2 supergravity
case(76-77).

by nice we mean the following: we know (from the new method of sec-
tion 4.3) that there exist transformation laws 1ab and 1f which, together
with

1  := d
1ea
:= 2ea
1a := 2a

(92)

(93)

(94)

leave the lagrangian (78) invariant.

a nice formula would be one where these 1ab and 1f would be
independent of dea (ie independent of ab) and of da (ie independent
of f ) respectively. we will end this section by giving strong arguments
supporting the idea that such a nice formula does not exist.

as in previous examples, the (d  1)-form dened by (42) is given by
formula (46)11. now, using the gravitinos equation of motion (81), we can
compute the eleven dimensional version of the pair of equations (68-69):

w 
ea =

i
4

(cid:16)2(7)a + ea(6)(cid:17) d +
b(cid:16)ab(6) + (5)(aeb)(cid:17) +

i

i

i
4

d(cid:16)2(7)a  ea(6)(cid:17)

11remember that if the induced auxiliary elds are supercovariants, so are the auxiliary

elds themselves, and then, only the gravitino transformation law contains d-terms.

25

w 
a

=

i
2

d(cid:16)(5)(cid:17)

(96)

where more goes for terms proportional to 3 and f and useless for
our purpose.

using the identity (43), the equations (95-96) are respectively equal to:

i
4
i
2

1 (cid:16)2(7)a  ea(6)(cid:17)  + more +

cd + 1f 
l2
cd + 1f 

l2

f (cid:19) (97)
f (cid:19) (98)

l2

and more has the same meaning as before.

the above two equalities are a special case of the general equation (51),
where x goes for dea and da and i for ab and f . as before, the auxiliary
eld equations of motion (83-84) ei are linear in x (namely in dea and da),
ie ei = eix + ei0. the very big dierence with the four dimensional
supergravities is that now r is also linear in (and not independent of) x
(by rearranging of equations (95-98)), r = rx + r0. that means
that 1i cannot be independent of x.
instead, we can choose it to be
linear in this variable x. the practical reasons for that annoying feature
are the gammalogy beyond four dimensions and also the presence of the
chern-simons term.

this means in particular that 1ab are linear in dea, and then in ab
2
(it is always possible to rewrite the derivative of the vierbein in term of the
induced connection). so it will be impossible to rewrite 1ab in a nice
way (nicer than the straightforward result given by (87-91)), in the sense
that only the independent auxiliary eld appears in the transformation laws
and not the induced one. the same is true for f and da.

this problem seems to appear as soon as we go beyond 4 dimensions.
the reason for that remains however unclear for us. on the other hand this
may have some importance for the construction of superspace versions of
these theories. a rst attempt at a deeper understanding should address
the 5 dimensional case where auxiliary elds are in principle known.

for completeness we should also mention related works by bars, mac-
dowell, higuchi and kallosh [20] where the (partially) rst order formalism
of [18] is combined with an identication of the three form gauge eld with
supertorsion so as to lead to more equivalent forms of classical 11 dimen-
sional supergravity. recently a preprint [21] appeared where some rst order

26

results for the three form sector of 11d supergravity are listed, they should
be obtainable from our formulas by elimination of the lorentz connection.

a conventions and useful formulas

the conventions are the following for a d-dimensional spacetime dimension
(see [22] for a more complete discussion):

ab = {, +, . . . , +}, 01...(d1) = 1, a (a = 0, . . . , d  1) are d gamma
matrices of dimension 2[ d
2 ] which satisfy the cliord algebra {a, b} = 2ab.
here, [r] is the integer part of r (i.e. [4.5]=4). if d is even (odd), d+1(11) :=

0 . . . d1, (cid:16)d+1(cid:17)2

where i is a (pi)-form anticommuting spinor (i = 1, . . . , 3). note that
the summation in (106) contains (d + 1) terms. in the case where d is odd,
half of them can be eliminated by a hodge-duality transformation (recall
that in that case d+1  11). then the summation goes only up to d1
and
a factor of 2 automatically cancels out in the denominator of (106).

the majorana (form)-spinors (which exist in d = 4 and d = 11) satisfy

the symmetry property:
