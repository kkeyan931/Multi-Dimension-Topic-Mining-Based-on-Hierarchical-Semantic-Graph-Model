abstract

non-bps type ii d-branes couple to r-r potentials via an action that,
upon tachyon condensation, gives rise to the wess-zumino action of
bps d-branes.

non-bps branes in string theory have received a lot of attention after
the seminal work by sen [1], as such non-bps states allow for highly
non-trivial tests of string dualities. in a related development, unstable
and/or non-bps d-branes have played a key role in the unifying de-
scription of all lower-dimensional d-branes as non-trivial excitations on
suitable congurations of higher-dimensional branes. this description
exhibits in a constructive way the fact that d-brane charges take values
in appropriate k-theory groups of space-time.

for type iib this was demonstrated by witten in [2], where all branes
were built from suciently many d9anti-d9 pairs. in this set-up, the
dp-brane that emerges via a process of tachyon condensation inherits
its anomalous wess-zumino couplings to the r-r elds [3],

swz =

(1.1)

from the analogous couplings of the parent branes. in eq. (1.1), tp/
denotes the dp-brane tension, c a formal sum of r-r potentials, f
the gauge eld on the brane and b the ns-ns two-form. the trace is
over the chan-paton indices. further, rt and rn are the curvatures

of the tangent and normal bundles of the d-brane world-volume, and a
denotes the a-roof genus.

as for type iia, horava described in [4] how to construct bps d(p 
2k  1)-branes as bound states of (suciently many) unstable dp-branes
(and thus how to construct all type iia d-branes in terms of d9-branes).
the lower-dimensional bps branes arise as the result of the condensation
of a tachyon eld into a vortex conguration, accompanied by non-trivial
gauge elds. in this case, it was not clear how the lower-dimensional bps
branes acquire the r-r couplings of eq. (1.1).

in [5] we argued that all type ii non-bps branes couple universally

to ramond-ramond elds as given by1

wz = azp+1
s 

c  d tr t e2 f +b  q a(rt )/ a(rn ) ,

(1.2)

where t is the real, adjoint tachyon eld living on the non-bps brane
and a is a constant. let us indicate how the r-r couplings of eq. (1.2)
account for the r-r couplings (1.1) of the stable lower-dimensional brane
that emerges from the process of tachyon condensation. the cases dp
 d(p  1) and dp  d(p  3) will be treated in detail. it will turn
out, for instance, that the r-r charges of the d8-branes and d6-branes
one constructs from unstable d9-branes [4] have the expected ratio.

consider rst a single non-bps dp-brane. there is a real tachyon
eld living on its worldvolume. the tachyon potential is assumed to
be such that the vacuum manifold consists of the two points {t0, t0}.
the tachyon can condense in a non-trivial (anti)-kink conguration t (x)
depending on a single coordinate. the r-r coupling (1.2) on the dp-
brane reads in this case

azp+1

c  dt  e2f +b  q a(rt )/ a(rn ) .

(1.3)

it involves the topological density xt (x), which is localized at the core
of the kink and is such that r dt (x) = 2t0. in the limit of zero size,
dt (x) = 2t0(x  x0)dx, and the above action takes the form of the
usual wess-zumino eective action for a bps d(p  1)-brane, localized
in the x-direction at x0:

2t0azp

c  e2f +b  q a(rt )/ a(rn ) .

(1.4)

1one term of this action (the one describing the coupling of a non-bps d9-brane to c9) was
conjectured to be present in ref. [4] and obtained by a disc computation in ref. [1].

as a less trivial example, let us start from two unstable dp-branes.
the tachyon eld t , transforming in the adjoint of the u(2) gauge group,
can form a non-trivial vortex conguration in co-dimension three. the
tachyon potential is assumed to be such that the minima of t have the
eigenvalues (t0, t0), so that the vacuum manifold is v = u(2)/(u(1) 
u(1)) = s2. the possible stable vortex congurations t (x), depending
on 3 coordinates xi transverse to the (p  2)-dimensional core of the
vortex, are classied by the non-trivial embeddings of the sphere at
innity s2

 into the vacuum manifold, namely by 2(v) = z.

apart from the center of mass u(1) subgroup, we are in the situation
of the georgi-glashow model, where the tachyon eld t (x) = t a(x)a
(a being the pauli matrices) sits in the adjoint of su(2), and the vac-
uum manifold is described by t at a = t 2
0 . the vortex conguration
of winding number one of the tachyon, which is the t hooft-polyakov
monopole, is accompanied by a non-trivial su(2) gauge eld:

t (x) = f (r)axa ,
aa
i (x) = h(r)a
ijxj ,

(1.5)

where r is the radial distance in the three transverse directions; the
prefactors f (r) and h(r) go to constants for r  0, while f (r)  t0/r
and h(r)  1/r2 for r  . the eld-strength in the unbroken u(1)
direction,

gij =

f a
ij

,

(1.6)

t a
t0

corresponds to a non-trivial u(1) bundle on the sphere at innity, i.e. the
magnetic charge g = rs 2
g is non-zero (and in fact equals the winding
number of the vortex in appropriate units). the magnetic charge density
in the transverse directions, dened by dg = (x)d3x, is concentrated at
the core of the vortex solution. in the zero size limit, there is a point-like
magnetic charge at the location of the core: (x) = g 3(x  x0).



the wz action (1.2) for the dp-brane can be rewritten as

azp+1

c  d tr{t e2f }  e2 f +b  q a(rt )/ a(rn ) ,

(1.7)

where we have split the u(2) eld-strength into its su(2) part f and
its u(1) part f . inserting the t hooft-polyakov conguration for the
tachyon and the su(2) gauge eld, we see that eq. (1.7) involves the
curl dg of the magnetic monopole eld g = t af a; we end up with

2at0 zp+1

c  (x)d3x  e2 f +b  q a(rt )/ a(rn ) .

(1.8)

we have a distribution of d(p  3)-brane charge localized at the core of
the vortex; in particular, in the limit of zero-size core we recover the r-r
couplings (1.2) of a bps d(p  3)-brane that supports the u(1) gauge
eld f .

since the minimal magnetic charge g is 4 in our units, eqs. (1.4) and
(1.8) lead to the expected ratio 42 for the r-r charges of d(p3)- and
d(p  1)-branes.

the mechanism described above generalizes to the reduction of a non-
bps dp-brane to a d(p  2k  1)-brane via tachyon condensation, de-
scribed in [4]. in this case, it is convenient to start with 2k unstable dp-
branes. the tachyon eld, which sits in the adjoint of u(2k), can be in a
vortex conguration, accompanied by non-trivial gauge elds, such that
tr{t (f)k}. the
there is a non-zero generalized magnetic charge rs 2k
wz action (1.2) then contains the generalized magnetic charge density
d tr{t f k} = (x)d2k+1x, localized at the core of the vortex.
in the
zero-size limit, we are left with the wz action for a d(p  2k  1)-brane.
the form of the r-r couplings (1.2) can be checked directly by com-



puting the corresponding string scattering amplitudes [5].
