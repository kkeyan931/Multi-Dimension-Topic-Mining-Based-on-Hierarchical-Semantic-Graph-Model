gauging of 1d-space translations for nonrelativistic

point particles

abstract

gauging of space translations for nonrelativistic point particles in one
dimension leads to general coordinate transformations with xed newtonian
time. the minimal gauge invariant extension of the particle velocity requires
the introduction of two gauge elds whose minimal self interaction leads to a
maxwellian term in the lagrangean. no dilaton eld is introduced. we x the
gauge such that the residual symmetry group is the galilei group. in case of a
line the two-particle reduced lagrangean describes the motion in a newtonian
gravitational potential with strength proportional to the energy. for particles
on a circle with certain initial conditions we only have a collective rotation
with constant angular velocity.

1 introduction

gauging a symmetry means to introduce space-time dependent functions instead of
the constant parameters of a global symmetry group. the original action, invariant
with respect to the global symmetry group, will in general not be gauge invariant.
in order to cancel the terms which violate the invariance one has to introduce com-
pensating elds as functions of space but also of time. these gauge elds have to
obey suitable transformation laws with respect to the now local symmetry.

the most important interactions in current physics are gauge interactions. in
elementary particle physics internal symmetry groups are gauged (quantumelectro-
dynamics, quantumchromodynamics, standard model). in general relativity, the
space-time symmetry group of special relativity (poincare group) is gauged. gauge
interactions are also of importance in condensed matter physics: the fractional quan-
tum hall eect may be described by an abelian gauge eld with a chern-simons term

minimally coupled to charged matter. therefore the gauge principle may be called
the leading principle for the construction of fundamental interactions in physics [1].
what about gauging the galilei group in nonrelativistic physics? in a recent
paper by de pietri et al. [2] this task has been taken up for point particles in (3+1)-
dimensions. the authors of [2] started with the nonrelativistic limit of general
relativity and threw away all elds not coupled to matter in this limit. our work
will be distinct from [2] in two respects:

i) we ask for the smallest number of gauge elds doing the job with a minimal

coupling lagrangean,

ii) we dont start with the nonrelativistic limit of a relativistic theory.

in this letter we treat the simplest example: point particles moving in one dimension.
the underlying global transformations are space translations whose gauging leads
to general coordinate transformations at xed newtonian time. for particles on a
line we will show in section 2 that the minimal coupling for this example consists of
only two gauge elds with an maxwellian interaction term. in particular we dont
introduce an additional dilaton eld as in (1+1)-gravity [3]. the arbitrary gauge
function in the solution for the gauge elds will be chosen such, that the residual
symmetry group of the action will be the galilei group and the boundary term for
eld variations in the action vanishes (section 3). in section 4 we derive the reduced
lagrangean for one and two particles respectively and discuss the solutions of their
equations of motion.
in section 5 we extend our results to particles on a circle.
with certain initial conditions relative motions of particles are absent. we obtain a
collective rotation with constant angular velocity only.

2 minimal-coupling lagrangean

let us start with n nonrelativistic particles in free motion on a line (r1) described
by the lagrangean1

l0 =

1

n

( x(t))2

x=1

the equations of motion (eom) following from (1)

x = 0

are invariant with respect to global galilei-transformations

(x, t)  (x, t)

(1)

(2)

(3)

1for reasons of simplicity we give all particles the same mass m=1 in appropriate units.

with

and

x = x + a + vt

t = t + b

(4)

(5)

where the parameters a, v and b take values in r1. now we generalize (4) to a local
transformation, given in innitesimal form by

x = a(x, t)

(6)

where a(x, t) is an arbitrary, twice dierentiable and bounded function of its argu-
ments. eq. (6) describes local translations (including local boosts). time transla-
tions are not considered for the moment.
obviously the eom (2) are not invariant with respect to the transformation (6). in
order to repair that, we introduce two gauge elds h(x, t) and e(x, t) and replace x
in (1) by the function2 

 = h(x, t) x + e(x, t).

(7)

invariance of  with respect to (6) requires the following transformation rules for
the gauge elds

where we dened

h = hxa , e = hta

f (x, t) := f (x + x, t)  f (x, t).

(8)

(9)

therefore, (7) supplies the minimal gauge invariant extension of x. now l0 in (1)
has to be replaced by

lmatter =

1
2

n

x=1

((t))2

with

(t) := h(x(t), t) x(t) + e(x(t), t)

(10)

(11)

we must supplement (10) by an invariant (or quasi-invariant) lagrangean leld
describing the self-interaction of the gauge elds. let us dene a eld strength f

f :=

1
h

(th  xe)

(12)

from the denition (9) we obtain easily the commutator between  and any partial
dierentiation   (t, x)

f = f  (a)xf

(13)

2our procedure diers from the corresponding one in [2] applied to one space dimension. in [2]
l0 would be replaced by a polynomial of second order in x requiring three gauge elds instead of
two.

3

we infer from (13) and (8) that our eld strength f is gauge invariant

therefore, any integral of the form

f = 0

with the invariant measure

zr1

dt(x)k(f (x, t))

dt(x) := h(x, t)dx

(14)

(15)

(16)

is a candidate for leld. the simplest, nontrivial example for the arbitrary function
k is given by a quadratic

with this maxwellian choice for leld our action takes the form

k(z) = z 2

with

s = z dt(lmatter + leld)

leld =

1

2g z dxh(x, t)f 2(x, t)

where g is a coupling strength.
by varying s with respect to x, h and e we get the eom

 + f = 0

f 2 = g x
xf = g x

(x  x)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

in order that the boundary term arising in the derivation of (21) vanishes and the
integral (18) for leld exists, our gauge elds have to satisfy the following boundary
conditions (a) at spatial innity:

(a1) e(x, t) and h(x, t) are nite at x = ,

(a2) f (x, t) vanishes at x = .

3 solutions of the eld equations and gauge xing

the solution of (21) satisfying (a2) is given by ((x) := x/|x|)

f (x, t) = 

g

(t)(x  x(t))

with the constraint

(t) = 0

x

(22)

(23)

with (19), (22) and (23) the eom (20) is satised identical.
from the expression (22) for the eld strength f and its relation to the gauge elds
(12) we obtain h and e only modulo an arbitrary gauge function (x, t)

h(x, t) = x(x, t)

e(x, t) = t(x, t) +

(t)(x  x(t))((x, t)  (t))

(24)

(25)

gauge xing means to choose an appropriate function (class of functions) for .
thereby we have to keep in mind, that the relation between  and the particle
variables {x, x} is gauge dependent3. a physical choice for  should fulll two
conditions:

i) the x(t) describe particle motion in an inertial frame. therefore, the symme-
try remaining after gauge xing (residual symmetry) is the galilean symmetry
in (1+1)-dimension.

ii) the boundary condition (a1) is satised.

we try to satisfy the rst condition with the ansatz

(x, t) = x  (a + vt)

because due to (8) and (13) we have  = 0 and therefore with (26)

x = a + tv

(26)

(27)

i.e. the residual symmetry is given by the galilei group4. in section 4 we will show,
that the resulting particle eom describe particle motion in an inertial frame at least
for n = 1 and n = 2. now the second condition (a1) is satised too. from (23) -
(26) we infer

in our gauge the total canonical particle momentum p is given by

p = x



which is conserved due to (31)5. it even has to vanish according to the constraint
(32). let us now discuss (30) - (32) for dierent particle numbers n.

n = 1
we have  = x  v and  = 0 i.e.

x = 0

as it should be.

n = 2
with  := 1  2 and x := x1  x2 we obtain from (30)

(34)

(35)

(36)

according to (35) the constraint (32) leads to an uniform motion of the center of
mass

x1 + x2 = 0

(37)

5our gauge elds carry no dynamical degrees of freedom. therefore, the eld contribution to

the momentum vanishes.

6

this result conrms the expectation that our gauge xing (26) together with the
constraint (32) describes particle motion in an inertial frame for n = 2.
insertion of (36) and (32) into (31) leads to the eom for x(t)

this eom may be derived from the reduced particle lagrangean

lred =

1 + g

2 |x|

(38)

(39)

the eom (37) and lred (39) are invariant with respect to time translations. there-
fore our residual symmetry is the full galilei group.

it is straightforward to show that lred follows from our total lagrangean (10)
and (18) by inserting the solutions for the gauge elds. the eom (38) may be
solved explicitly:
with the conserved energy e corresponding to lred

(38) takes the form

e =

1
4

x2
1 + g

2 |x|

x  ge(x) = 0

(40)

(41)

this is newtons eom for a gravitational potential whose strength is proportional
to e.
from (40) we conclude, that the relative particle motion described by x(t) is bounded
for e = 0 and for e > 0 with g < 0, but unbounded in all other cases. from (41)
we infer that x(t) is given by a second order polynomial.

5 particles on a circle

let us apply the foregoing results to a compact manifold, a circle. in order to do
that we have to substitute everywhere

x  ,

  <  < 

(42)

and to require 2-periodicity in  for our gauge elds. in doing so the only problem
arises from the step function contained in the expressions for f (, t) and e(, t). it
decomposes into a periodic and a non-periodic part

() =

2




xn=1

sin n

n

+




7

(43)

therefore periodicity of f (, t), which now, as the general solution of (21), is given
by

f (, t) = 

(t)(  (t)) + f0(t)

g
2 x

(44)

(45)

forces a vanishing coecient of 

 = 0

x

in accordance with (23).
in order to reproduce the gauge (26) with a periodic gauge function (, t) we have
to put

with

leading to

(, t) = 0()  (a + vt)

0() := 2 arctan(tg


2

)

0() = 

for   <  < .

with this choice e(, t) is given by

(46)

(47)

(48)

e(, t) =  v + (0()  (a + vt))f0(t) +

+

g
2 x

(t)(  (t))(0()  (t))

(49)

periodicity of e(, t) enforces the additional constraint

thus we obtain instead of (30) the relation

 = 0

x

 =   v + (  (a + vt))f0

+

||

g

2 x

(50)

(51)

with  <  <   and  :=   .
in order to have time-translational invariance for our particle dynamics, the t-
dependence of (t) must arise solely from the particle trajectories (t). eq. (51)
tells us, that this requires

f0 = 0

(52)

so that we have for the determination of our trajectories the same set of equations
as in section 4 supplemented by (50).
let us consider an initial condition where

8

i) all particles are at dierent positions at t = 0

(0) 6= (0)   6= 

(53)

ii) the angular velocities at t = 0 are equal to v for n  2 particles, i.e.

(0) = v

for

1    n  2 .

(54)

then we obtain from (30) - (32) and (50)

(t) = v

 ,

t  r1

(55)

i.e. we have no relative particle motion but only a collective rotation with constant
angular velocity6.
the proof of (55) runs as follows:
due to (30) and (50) we may represent 1,2 as linear combinations of the others

at t = 0 we obtain from (54), (56) and (30)1n 2

 = 0 

(56)

(57)

which holds, due to (31) t  r1. inserting (57) for arbitrary t into (30) leads to
the desired result (55).

6 conclusions

we have shown that the application of the gauge principle to point particles in one
dimension leads to a nontrivial interaction between two particles on a line. on a
circle we observe for appropriate initial conditions a collective rotation only. in this
case a sensitivity analysis for perturbations of the initial conditions would be useful.
work on the gauging of space translations for nonrelativistic matter elds is in
progress. results will be reported elsewhere.
next we intend to treat the 2d-case with a chern-simons interaction for the gauge
elds. thereby we will include the second central charge of the galilei group in
(2 + 1)-dimensions in the free-particle lagrangean (cp. [4]).

acknowledgement

im grateful to my colleagues ph. blanchard and e.h. de groot for fruitful dis-

cussions and suggestions.

6it is quite interesting to note that for n = 2 we can distinguish locally whether the particles

are on a line or on a large circle.
