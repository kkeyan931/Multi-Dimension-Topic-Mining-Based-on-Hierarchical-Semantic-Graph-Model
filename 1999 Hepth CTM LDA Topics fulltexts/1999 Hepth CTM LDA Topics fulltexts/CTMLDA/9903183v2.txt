abstract

recently jarvis has proved a correspondence between su (n ) monopoles and rational
maps of the riemann sphere into ag manifolds. furthermore, he has outlined a
construction to obtain the monopole elds from the rational map. in this paper we
examine this construction in some detail and provide explicit examples for spherically
symmetric su (n ) monopoles with various symmetry breakings.
in particular we
show how to obtain these monopoles from harmonic maps into complex projective
spaces. the approach extends in a natural way to monopoles in hyperbolic space
and we use it to construct new spherically symmetric su (n ) hyperbolic monopoles.

i. introduction

this paper is concerned with static su(n) bps monopoles, which are topological
solitons in a yang-mills-higgs gauge theory. the bogomolny equation, which describes
all static monopoles, is integrable and so a variety of techniques are available for studying
monopoles, including twistor methods. despite this fact there are still only a limited
number of known explicit monopole solutions, though the integrability of the bogomolny
equation allows many features of monopoles, such as the dimensions of their moduli spaces,
to be determined.

an example where the integrability of the bogomolny equation can be used to prove
results on monopoles is the correspondence proved by jarvis [1], between monopoles and
rational maps from the riemann sphere into ag manifolds. the rational map arises as the
scattering data, along half-lines from the origin, of a linear operator constructed from the
monopole elds. furthermore, in proving the correspondence jarvis outlines an inverse
scattering procedure whereby the monopole elds can be reconstructed from the rational
map. it is this construction which is the focus of this paper. the construction involves
solving a nonlinear partial dierential equation which is equivalent to the bogomolny equa-
tion, but for which the boundary conditions are given in terms of the rational map. this is
the main point of the construction, since for the original bogomolny equation it is not at all
clear how to specify boundary conditions on the elds so as to obtain a unique monopole
solution. we perform the construction explicitly for several examples of su(n) monopoles
with spherical symmetry and a variety of symmetry breakings. the solutions are obtained
from harmonic maps of the plane into cipn 1, with the degrees of the harmonic maps
related to the topological charges of the monopoles.

perhaps we should make it clear at this point that there are several approaches to
studying spherically symmetric monopoles [2, 3, 4, 5] and the main aim of this paper is
not the construction of new monopole solutions, but rather to gain a better understanding
of the correspondence between monopoles and rational maps. in particular we study the
construction of monopole solutions from the rational map data, and su(n) monopoles
with spherical symmetry are a good vehicle for this.

the construction of monopoles from rational maps has a natural generalization to
monopoles in hyperbolic space. using this approach we construct explicit solutions for
spherically symmetric su(n) hyperbolic monopoles. as far as we are aware these multi-
monopole solutions are new. as we shall see, the construction of hyperbolic monopoles
has a simplifying feature in comparison to the euclidean case, and therefore a useful way
to obtain the euclidean solutions is as the zero curvature limit of the hyperbolic ones.

ii. su(n) monopoles

bps monopoles are nite energy solutions to the bogomolny equation

di = 

1
2

ijk f jk

(1)

where di = i + [ai, ] is the covariant derivative with ai, for i = 1, 2, 3, an su(n)-valued
gauge potential with gauge eld fjk = jak  kaj + [aj, ak]. the higgs eld, , is an
su(n)-valued scalar eld for which nontrivial asymptotic boundary conditions are imposed
so that topological solitons exist. more precisely, there is a choice of gauge such that in a
given direction the higgs eld for large radius r is given by

 = i0 

i
r

1 + o(

1
r2 )

(2)

where 0 = diag(1, 2, . . . , n ), with the trace-free condition requiring that 1 + 2 +
. . . + n = 0, and we choose the ordering such that 1  2  . . .  n . 1 is another
diagonal matrix, 1 = 1
2diag(n1, n2  n1, . . . , nn 1  nn 2, nn 1), and it can be shown
that the numbers n1, n2, ..., nn 1 are always integers.
0 is the vacuum expectation value of  and it breaks the symmetry group from su(n)
to a residual symmetry group j, given by the isotropy group of 0. the higgs eld on the
two-sphere at innity denes a map from s2 to the coset space of vacua su(n)/j, so that
when 2(su(n)/j) is non-trivial then all solutions have a topological characterization.

if the i are all distinct then the residual symmetry group is the maximal torus, that

is, j = u(1)n 1, and this is known as maximal symmetry breaking. in this case

2  su(n)

u(1)n 1! = 1(u(1)n 1) = zzn 1

(3)

so the monopoles are associated with n  1 integers, which are called the topological
charges, and are precisely the integers n1, n2, ..., nn 1 appearing in 1.
in contrast the case of minimal symmetry breaking is when all but one of the i coincide,

so the residual symmetry group is u(n  1). since

2  su(n)

u(n  1)! = zz

(4)

there is only one topological charge in this case and the remaining integers are called mag-
netic weights. the simplest way to distinguish the topological charges from the magnetic
weights is to examine the expression for the energy of the monopole.

the condition (2) guarantees that the conguration has nite energy

e =

1

4z tr(cid:18)1

2

f 2

ij + (di)2(cid:19) d3x.

3

(5)

the energy depends only on the topological charges and the asymptotic eigenvalues of ,
in fact

e = (1  2)n1 + (2  3)n2 + . . . + (n 1  n )nn 1.

(6)
from this expression it can be seen that the dierence j  j+1 determines the mass
of the monopole of type j, of which there are nj in the given solution. in the minimal
symmetry breaking case, where 2 = 3 = . . . = n , then all but the rst type of monopole
becomes massless, so that n1 remains a topological charge but the remaining integers
become magnetic weights and do not contribute to the value of the energy. note that we
can not distinguish in a gauge invariant way between n2  n1, ..., nn 1  nn 2 and nn 1,
and so when we refer to values of magnetic weights it is understood that this equivalence
should be applied.

for intermediate cases of symmetry breaking the residual symmetry group is j =
u(1)r  k, where k is a rank n  r  1 semisimple lie group, the exact form of which
depends on how the i coincide with each other. such monopoles have r topological charges.

iii. rational maps

in this section we briey review the recent correspondence proved by jarvis [1],
between su(n) monopoles and rational maps from the riemann sphere into ag manifolds.
actually the correspondence proved in [1] is more general than this and is valid for all
compact semisimple gauge groups g, but in this paper we shall only be concerned with
the simplest case of g = su(n).

the rst step is to introduce polar coordinates, so that a point of ir3 is given by
a distance r from the origin and a direction determined by a point z on the riemann
sphere around the origin.
in terms of the usual angular coordinates ,  this is simply
z = ei tan(/2).

the jarvis map is obtained by considering hitchins equation

(dr  i)s = 0

(7)

for the complex n-vector s, along each radial half-line from the origin out to innity, with
the direction of the half-line determined by the value of z.

for the moment we shall assume that we are dealing with maximal symmetry breaking.
from the boundary conditions (2) we see that since at spatial innity  is in the gauge
orbit of 0 then in the n-dimensional solution space there is a one-dimensional subspace
generated by the solution which decays at the fastest rate as r  . now evaluate this
solution at r = 0. this procedure has thus determined a line in cn for each value of z. the
next step is to consider how this line varies with the direction z, and the analysis shows
that it varies holomorphically. the crucial ingredient here is that the bogomolny equation
(1) implies that [dr  i, dz] = 0, so that the operator in equation (7) commutes with the
covariant derivative in the angular direction dz. it can be shown that the degree of this
holomorphic map into cipn 1 is precisely the topological charge n1, and hence the map is
rational. note that if we apply a gauge transformation then the map will be transformed by

4

multiplication by a constant element of su(n), corresponding to the gauge transformation
evaluated at the origin, so that we consider only the equivalence classes of such maps.

now we repeat the above process but this time we consider the two-dimensional solution
space generated by the solution which decays fastest and the solution which decays the
next fastest. in the same way as above this will now dene a holomorphic plane in cn (ie.
a space spanned by two holomorphic lines), which of course will contain the holomorphic
line we have already described. the degree of this plane is equal to the topological charge
n2, and so again the map is rational. proceeding in this way we nally arrive at the rational
map r : cip1 7 f(cn ), where f(cn ) denotes the space of total ags in cn . this is a
series of vector subspaces 0  v1  v2  ...  vn 1  cn , where vi has dimension i,
which is clearly the structure we have just described.
in the above discussion the degrees refer to the elements of the homotopy group
2(f(cn )) = zzn 1, and are given by the highest powers which occur in some holomor-
phic polynomials, as described later. for a detailed discussion of rational maps into ag
manifolds and their relationship to monopoles the interested reader may nd it useful to
consult refs. [6, 7].

for symmetry breaking which is not maximal the picture is similar, except that now the
rational map will not be into the space of total ags, since the exponential decay of some
of the solutions will be the same and hence some of the subspaces vi will be missing from
the ag. this of course corresponds to the fact that there will now be fewer topological
charges, and these correspond to the degrees of the maps into the vector spaces which
remain in the ag.

because the construction of the rational map from the monopole does not break the
rotational symmetry of ir3 it is a very useful approach for studying monopoles with sym-
metries. for the case of su(2) there is only one vector subspace; the space of lines in
c2. thus the rational map is r : cip1 7 cip1, that is, a rational map between riemann
spheres, and its degree is the sole topological charge. by explicit construction of some
symmetric maps the existence of various su(2) monopoles with special symmetries has
been proved [8].

iv. constructing the monopole

the proof of the correspondence between monopoles and rational maps [1] involves
constructing the monopole from the rational map. the starting point is to write the
bogomolny equation (1) in terms of the coordinates r, z, z and observe that a (complex)
gauge can always be chosen so that

 = iar = 

i
2

h 1rh, az = h 1zh, az = 0

where h  sl(n, c) is a hermitian matrix.

the bogomolny equation is then equivalent to the single equation for h

r(cid:16)h 1 rh(cid:17) +

(1 + |z|2)2

r2

z(cid:16)h 1 zh(cid:17) = 0

5

(8)

(9)

which we shall refer to as the jarvis equation. jarvis [1] then proves that solutions of this
equation are determined by the rational map, which species the asymptotic boundary
conditions on h for large r. the analysis presented in [1] is complicated and is not very
suitable for attempting to implement the construction explicitly, so in this section we shall
present a more explicit prescription for determining the boundary conditions on h in terms
of the rational map.

for simplicity in this section we shall restrict to the case of su(2) monopoles. with
a choice of normalization for the higgs eld we have the boundary conditions on the
monopole as

 = (1 

n
2r

+ o(

1
r2 ))

(10)

where  is in the gauge orbit of i3 = diag(i,i), and n is the topological charge.
the form

any 2  2 hermitian matrix h, which has unit determinant, can always be written in

h = exp{g(p 

)}

(11)

1
2

where g is a real function and p is a 2  2 hermitian projector, that is, p  = p = p 2.
a motivation for introducing projectors is that it is a useful formulation for dealing with
similar equations that arise in the context of skyrmions [9]. examining the asymptotic
boundary condition (10) for large r we see that the magnitude of the higgs eld at innity is
a constant and moreover the direction of the higgs eld in the su(2) algebra is independent
of the radius to leading order in 1/r. comparing this behaviour with equation (8) for the
higgs eld in terms of h, we nd that the leading order behaviour for large r is that
the prole function g is independent of the angular coordinates z, z and the projector p
is a function only of the angular coordinates. we are now going to examine the large r
behaviour of the solution, so we use the above leading order result and set g(r) and p (z, z).

computing the higgs eld we obtain

tr(2) =

+ o(

r2 ).

(12)

(13)

integrating this equation for g we obtain (there is a choice of sign here that we shall discuss
below)

on substituting the form (11) into equation (9) and using the asymptotic expression (14)
we obtain the result that

g = 4r + 2n log r + o(1).

(14)

e4rr2(n+1)(1 + |z|2)2[p pz z + pzpz] + o(

1
r2 ) = 0

(15)

6

where subscripts denote partial dierentiation. the coecient of the growing term in (15)
must therefore vanish and we nd the equation satised by p is

(p pz)z = 0.

(16)

the equation p pz = 0 gives the instanton solutions of the cip1 -model in the plane (see
eg. ref [10]) and clearly these will satisfy equation (16). furthermore, as we prove in the
appendix, this gives all solutions of equation (16).

all instanton solutions of the cip1 -model are given by

p =

f f 
|f|2

(17)

where f is a 2-component column vector whose entries are holomorphic functions of z.
note that the multiplication of f by an overall factor does not change the projector p , so
that f is an element of cip1.

substituting the asymptotic behaviour (14) into equation (12) we obtain the expression

for the higgs eld on the two-sphere at innity

 = i(2p  1).

(18)

the topological charge, n, is the winding number of this map, which is equal to the degree
of the holomorphic vector f (z) which is used to construct the projector via (17). thus we
conclude that the boundary condition on h is determined in this simple and explicit way
in terms of the degree n rational map f (z) : cip1 7 cip1.
note that (17) and (18) give us an explicit expression for the higgs eld at innity in
terms of the rational map. naively one may think that this does not contain very much
information, since for example it is always possible to choose a (singular) gauge in which
the higgs eld at innity is diagonal and constant. however, the important point is that
our expression is given in an explicit known gauge, and therefore we have removed the
gauge freedom and are left with the physical information in the higgs eld: the fact that
it is rational.

to be precise, we have not yet proved an equivalence between the rational map f and
the one introduced by jarvis [1]. to prove this equivalence we shall now show that f is
indeed the map obtained as the scattering data.1

in a unitary gauge there is a basis of solutions to hitchins equation (7) which have the

leading order large r behaviour

(19)
where j is an eigenvalue of i and vj is the corresponding eigenvector. in the su(2)
case, when 1 = 2 = 1, the scattering map is determined by the decaying solution or
more fundamentally by the solution associated with the 1 = 1 eigenspace. recall that
the scattering map is obtained by evaluating this solution at the origin r = 0. now, in the

s  ej rvj

1we thank nick manton for suggesting this analysis.

7

gauge (8) hitchins equation is trivialised to rs = 0, so the solutions are r independent
and hence the scattering map is the eigenvector of i with eigenvalue one. thus all
that remains to be shown is that f is the eigenvector of i with eigenvalue one. using
the explicit expression (18) and the denition of the projector (17) this is elementary as

 if = (2p  1)f = (

2f f 

|f|2  1)f = f.

(20)

on a minor point, it is worth while making a comment about the choice of sign made in
equation (14) when taking the square root and integrating equation (13). if the opposite
choice of sign is made then following through the analysis we nd that the boundary
condition is determined by an anti-holomorphic map. thus this choice of sign is merely
an orientation and determines whether we wish monopoles to correspond to holomorphic
or anti-holomorphic rational maps.

the construction of a monopole from its rational map is now clear. choose a rational
map f (z) and calculate the associated projector (17). then compute the solution of the
jarvis equation (9) satisfying the boundary condition that for large r

h  exp(r(2  4p )).

(21)

obviously this construction is not easy to implement explicitly in practice, since it still
requires the solution of a nonlinear partial dierential equation. in this sense it is not as
powerful as say the adhmn construction [11], which reduces the problem to solving a set
of nonlinear matrix ordinary dierential equations plus a further linear system of ordinary
dierential equations. the advantage is that for the construction discussed here the data is
free, in that any rational map is allowed, whereas in the adhmn construction the nahm
data must satisfy complicated constraints (including the aforementioned set of nonlinear
ordinary dierential equations). thus even using the adhmn construction very few ex-
plicit examples of monopole solutions are known. there is always an inherent diculty
associated with solving the monopole equations and the dierence between these two alter-
native constructions is whether the main diculty resides in performing the construction
or specifying the data upon which the construction is performed.

there are simplifying special cases for which we are able to perform the construction
explicitly, the easiest example being the rational map f = (1, z)t, which corresponds to the
spherically symmetric su(2) 1-monopole. in this case the asymptotic behaviour, g(r) and
p (z, z), is valid for all r and substituting (11) into the jarvis equation gives the following
ordinary dierential equation for the prole function

g +

2
r2 (1  eg) = 0.

(22)

the large r boundary condition g  4r, together with the condition g(0) = 0, which is
required for h to be well-dened at the origin, determines the unique solution of (22) as

g = 2 log(2r/sinh2r).

(23)

8

this gives the well-known 1-monopole solution and comparing the asymptotic expansion
of (23) with equation (14) we verify that n = 1, so we see explicitly that the topological
charge is determined as the degree of the rational map and there is no freedom in the
prole function once the map has been specied.

in the following section we provide some explicit examples of solutions to the jarvis
equation, corresponding to spherically symmetric su(n) monopoles with various symme-
try breakings. we present the rational maps and describe how the solutions of the jarvis
equation are obtained from these in terms of harmonic maps into cipn 1.

v. harmonic maps and spherical monopoles

in the rst part of this section we briey review some facts that we shall need
about harmonic maps of the cipn 1 -model in the plane. these results can be found in,
for example, ref. [10].

a. harmonic maps

the harmonic map (or -model) equations for the cipn 1 model are given by

where p is an n  n hermitian projector.

as stated earlier, one set of solutions to these equations are the instantons given by

[pz z, p ] = 0

(24)

p (f ) =

f f 
|f|2

(25)

where f (z) is an n-component column vector which is a holomorphic function of z and
whose degree is equal to the topological charge of the -model. another set of solutions
are the anti-instantons, which have the same form but this time f is an anti-holomorphic
function, and then the -model topological charge is minus the degree of f.

for n = 2 these are all the nite action solutions, but for n > 2 there are other
non-instanton solutions. these can be described by introducing the operator  dened by
its action on any vector f  cn as

f = zf 

f (f  zf )

|f|2

(26)

and then dene further vectors kf by induction: kf = (k1f ).

to proceed further we note the following useful properties of kf when f is holomor-

phic:

(kf ) lf = 0,

k 6= l
z(cid:16)kf(cid:17) = k1f |kf|2
|k1f|2 ,

9

z  k1f
|k1f|2! =

kf

|k1f|2 .

(27)

(28)

these properties either follow directly from the denition of  or are easy to prove [10].
it is also convenient to dene projectors pk corresponding to the family of vectors kf as

pk = p (kf ), k = 0, .., n  1.

(29)

applying  a total of n  1 times to a holomorphic vector gives an anti-holomorphic
vector, so that a further application of  gives the zero vector and hence no corresponding
projector.

the projectors pk are solutions of the harmonic map equations (24) and all solutions
can be found in this way by starting with an appropriate holomorphic vector f . in the
cip1 case the operator  converts a holomorphic vector to an anti-holomorphic vector,
that is, instantons to anti-instantons and these are all the solutions in this case.

note that the projectors obtained from this sequence always satisfy the relationpn 1

for connecting harmonic maps with monopoles it is useful to recall the following in-
terpretation of the non-instanton solutions [10]. from a holomorphic vector f form the
exterior product of f and its derivatives as

1.

k=0 pk =

hk = f  zf  ..  k
z f,

k = 0, ..., n  1.

(30)

thus hk is holomorphic, though it is an element of a larger dimensional space; it may be
represented as a totally anti-symmetric tensor with k + 1 indices. with this notation it
may then be shown that

(31)
where  denotes the summation over all the indices of hk1 and all but the rst index of hk.
here  denotes that two vectors are equal up to an overall factor, which is the important
equivalence since we are dealing with elements of projective spaces. equation (31) leads
to the relation

hk1  hk  kf

deg(kf ) = deg(hk)  deg(hk1)

(32)

where the left-hand side is dened as the -model topological charge of the projector
pk = p (kf ), and deg(hk) is the highest power of z which occurs in the holomorphic
tensor hk. thus the non-instanton solutions may be interpreted as special mixtures of in-
stantons and anti-instantons.

b. spherical monopoles

in section iv we saw that the rational map for the spherically symmetric su(2) 1-
monopole is given by f (z) = (1, z)t. this map is spherically symmetric in the sense that a
rotation in ir3, which is realised as an su(2) mobius transformation

z + 
 z + 

z 7 ez =

, with ||2 + ||2 = 1

(33)

10

can be compensated by a constant su(2) gauge transformation. explicitly

f (ez) (cid:18)   



 (cid:19) f (z).

(34)

(35)

this is the only spherically symmetric map into cip1 which has positive degree and hence
there are no more spherically symmetric su(2) monopoles. for su(n) we rst require
spherically symmetric maps into cipn 1 and these are given by

f = (f0, ..., fj, ..., fn 1)t, where fj = zjvuut n  1
j !

and(cid:16)n 1

j (cid:17) denote the binomial coecients. it can be shown that these maps are spherically

symmetric by an explicit presentation of the compensating transformation as in (34). of
course there are other spherically symmetric maps which are obtained by embedding the
above maps and setting all other entries to be zero.

for a spherically symmetric su(n) monopole we require a rational map into the space
of total ags f(cn ), which has spherical symmetry. thus we need an explicit representation
of the holomorphic line, the holomorphic plane (which contains the line),...etc. as we shall
see in more detail below, we take each k-dimensional subspace to be the space spanned
by the vectors f, zf, ..., k1
f, where f is the spherical map (35). note that these are
precisely the spaces hk1 dened in (30). thus the topological charges of the monopole,
nk, are given by

z

nk = deg(hk1), k = 1, ..., n  1.

(36)

hence from (32) it is clear that the monopole topological charges are therefore not equal
to the -model topological charges of the harmonic maps from which we shall create them.
the exception to this statement is the case n = 2, where all the harmonic maps are
instantons and then the only degree is deg(h0) which in this case is equal to the -model
topological charge.

the degree of the map (35) is n  1 and hence it is easy to calculate the degree of hk

from (30) which, after taking into account the anti-symmetry, gives

nk = deg(hk1) = k(n  k),

k = 1, ..., n  1.

(37)

thus we have computed the monopole topological charges and now it remains to construct
the corresponding solution of the jarvis equation. the su(n) generalization of the su(2)
form given in (11) is to take a sum of the n  1 projectors

h = exp{g0(p0 

1
n

) + g1(p1 

1
n

) + ... + gn 2(pn 2 

1
n

)}

(38)

where gk(r) for k = 0, ..., n  2, are prole functions. recall that the projector pn 1 is
a linear combination of the other projectors plus the identity matrix, which is why it is
not included in the above formula. the prole functions satisfy the regularity condition

11

gk(0) = 0, and have a linear growth in r for large r, the coecients of which determine the
symmetry breaking pattern. once the symmetry breaking is specied the prole functions
are, of course, uniquely determined; since there is a one-to-one correspondence between
monopoles and rational maps. we shall illustrate this explicitly in the following with some
examples.

c. su(3) examples

for n = 3, with symmetry breaking to u(1)  u(1), the charges (37) are (n1, n2) =
(2, 2). from (35) the holomorphic line is given by f = (1,2z, z2)t and the plane is spanned
by f and fz. the su(3) case has a simplifying feature, in that the holomorphic plane in
c3 can be specied by giving a line orthogonal to the plane; which will then be anti-
holomorphic. this line is given by

f = f  fz = 2(z2,

2z, 1)t

(39)

f = f 

which is clearly anti-holomorphic and by construction is orthogonal to the holomorphic
plane, that is, f 
fz = 0. by inspection of (39) the plane has degree two and clearly
has spherical symmetry (compare the structure of f and f ). hence in this case it is simple
to see that the charge is (2, 2). however, as an illustration of the general formalism we
shall also present this example in terms of the notation described above. thus we nd

h0 =

12z
z2

 ,

h1 =

0

2
2
0
2z 2z2

2z
2z2
0



(40)

giving (n1, n2) = (deg(h0), deg(h1)) = (2, 2).

taking the hk from (40) we construct the associated projectors, using (31), and insert
these into the form for h given in (38). this gives a solution of the jarvis equation provided
the prole functions satisfy the ordinary dierential equations

the higgs eld is given in terms of the solution of the jarvis equation by (8) and the

it is simple to verify that the topological charge is (2, 2) without resorting to an explicit
solution of the prole function equations (41). maximal symmetry breaking implies that
0 > 1 > 0, so that the terms in (41) which contain exponentials of prole functions
do not contribute to the leading order behaviour which is o( 1
r2 ). the coecients of this
leading order term then simply give that 0 = 4, 1 = 2, which when substituted into (43)
conrms that (n1, n2) = (2, 2).

the explicit solutions for the prole functions can be obtained, for example, if we choose
0 = diag(2, 0,2), then the solution is g0 = 2g1 = 2g, where g is the 1-monopole prole
function dened in (23).
if we now consider the case of minimal symmetry breaking then the topological charges
which survive will be unchanged, but the magnetic weights will not be given by the topo-
logical charges which do not survive. as an example consider the symmetry breaking
to u(1)  su(2) given by 0 = diag(1, 1
2 ). from (43) this corresponds to setting
0 = 3, 1 = 0. the previous analysis of the prole function equations must now be modi-
ed to take into account the fact that exponentials of prole functions may now contribute
to leading order (this happens whenever any of the k coincide or are zero, and corresponds
to changing the symmetry breaking pattern). in this case it is easy to see that (41) requires
that 0 = 3, 1 = 0, 1 = 1
2 which gives the values (n1, [n2]) = (2, [1]), where we have
used the notation that square brackets denote magnetic weights rather than topological
charges.

2, 1

the prole function equations that we obtain are related to those derived from the
ansatz based approach of bais et al [3, 2] and the methods employed there can be adapted to
solve for the prole functions explicitly. this method requires a careful limiting procedure
to be taken to deal with non-maximal symmetry breaking. in section vi we shall see that
the solutions for monopoles in hyperbolic space are obtained without the need for this
limiting procedure and the euclidean case can then be obtained from the natural limit in
which the curvature of hyperbolic space tends to zero.

for this example the solution is (see section vi)

g0 = log

g1 = log

81 r4

4 [(3r  1)er + e2r] [(3r  1)er + e2r]
9 r2 [(3r  1)er + e2r]
2 [(3r  1)er + e2r]2

(44)

and it can be checked that the asymptotic properties are as stated above.

spherically symmetric monopoles of lower charge, such as the (1, 1) monopole, can be
obtained in a similar way by embedding the spherically symmetric maps (35) of lower de-
gree.

as for the su(3) case it is a simple task to conrm the topological charge by a leading order
analysis of this set of equations. for the choice 0 = diag(3, 1,1,3), corresponding to
equal monopole masses, the explicit solution is g0/3 = g1/2 = g2 = g, where g is given by
(23).

there are several possible symmetry breakings and in each case it is a simple matter to
determine both the topological charges and magnetic weights by an analysis of equations
(45).

vi. hyperbolic monopoles

hyperbolic monopoles are solutions of the bogomolny equation (1) in which
euclidean space ir3 is replaced by hyperbolic 3-space, which we denote by ih3
, where 2
is the curvature of hyperbolic space. they were rst studied by atiyah [12], who observed
that s1 invariant instantons can be interpreted as hyperbolic monopoles. often hyperbolic
monopoles turn out to be easier to study than the euclidean case and we shall see this
explicitly in the following. it has long been expected that in the limit as the curvature of
hyperbolic space tends to zero then euclidean monopoles are recovered, but only recently
has this been rigorously established [13]. in this section we shall adapt the methods of
section v to the hyperbolic case to obtain spherically symmetric su(n) monopoles. the
su(2) 1-monopole solution has been obtained before [14], as a circle invariant instanton,
but we believe that all our multi-monopole solutions are new. by explicitly taking the
zero curvature limit we recover the euclidean monopole solutions and explain why this
is a simpler way to obtain these solutions than to consider the euclidean case from the
beginning.

perhaps the most familiar description of ih3

 is as the interior of the unit ball. in terms

of angular coordinates z, z and radial coordinate   [0, 1) the metric is

ds2 =

4

2(1  2)2 (d2 + 2

4dzdz

(1 + |z|2)2 ) = dr2 +

sinh2(r)

2

4dzdz
(1 + |z|2)2

(50)

where we have introduced r, the hyperbolic distance from the origin, through the relation
 = tanh(r/2).

the radial scattering analysis proceeds as in the euclidean case with the upshot that

the jarvis equation (9) in hyperbolic space becomes [13, 1]

r(cid:16)h 1 rh(cid:17) +

2(1 + |z|2)2
sinh2(r)

z(cid:16)h 1 zh(cid:17) = 0.

(51)

note that in the zero curvature limit,   0, the euclidean equation (9) is recovered.

15

solutions of (51) can be obtained using the form (38), with the same harmonic maps,
but leading to modied equations for the prole functions. the equations for the monopole
elds in terms of h are still given by (8), but with r now being hyperbolic distance. hence
the asymptotic boundary conditions remain the same as in the euclidean case and together
with the requirement that the prole functions vanish at the origin this determines a unique
solution for any given choice of vacuum expectation value 0.

for the su(2) 1-monopole there is just one prole function, which must satisfy the

equation

g +

22

sinh2(r)

(1  eg) = 0.

(52)

if we again normalize the higgs eld to have unit magnitude then the boundary conditions
on the prole function are g(0) = 0 and g(r)  4r for large r. the solution is

g = 2 log

(2 + )sinh(r)
sinh((2 + )r)

(53)

which gives the known su(2) hyperbolic 1-monopole [14].

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

for equal monopole masses, with 0 = diag(2, 0,2), the solution is g0 = 2g1 = 2g, with
g given by (53). for general 0, including minimal symmetry breaking, we now describe
how the solution to (54) can be obtained using hirotas method.

introducing the tau-functions 0, 1 via the transformation

g0 = log

sinh4(r)

014

,

g1 = log

0sinh2(r)

 2
1 2

converts equation (54) into hirota bilinear form
d2i.i + 4i+1i1 = 0,

i = 0, 1

where we have dened 1 = 2 = 1, and d is the hirota derivative dened by [15]

dm. = (r  er)m(r)(er)|er=r.

the hirota derivative has many special properties which make the construction of solutions
to bilinear equations such as (56) an elegant procedure. in particular from (57) it is clear
that its action on exponential functions takes the simple form
dme1r.e2r = (1  2)me(1+2)r

(58)

16

using this property, together with the bilinear form of the equation, means that it is a
simple task to nd solutions which are nite sums of exponential functions; in the context
of integrable soliton equations, such as the kdv equation, solutions of bilinear equations
which are a nite sum of exponentials correspond to multi-solitons [15].

note that the bilinear equations (56) are independent of the curvature, 2, so in
particular these equations are the ones which also arise for euclidean monopoles. however,
the transformation (55) involves  which means that the boundary conditions on the tau-
functions are  dependent, and this is of crucial importance. for hyperbolic monopoles,
ie.  6= 0, the solutions satisfying the required boundary conditions are always given as
a simple sum of exponentials, whereas for euclidean monopoles the boundary conditions
(except for the case of maximal symmetry breaking) mean that the solutions are not so
simple and involve a sum of products of exponentials and polynomials. by taking the limit
  0 of a hyperbolic solution the more complicated euclidean solutions are obtained and
this is perhaps the most natural method to construct euclidean monopoles.
as an example, consider the minimal symmetry breaking of su(3) obtained from
0 = diag(1, 1
2 ). as discussed in section v this choice of 0 corresponds to the
large r boundary conditions gi  ir, with 0 = 3, 1 = 0. comparing this with the
transformation (55) gives the large r boundary conditions

2, 1

0  a0e(2+2)r,

1  a1e(1+2)r

(59)

for some constants ai. the requirement that gi(0) = 0 gives the conditions at the origin
that 0 = r2 + ..., 1 = r2 + ... as r  0. using the leading order behaviour (59) together
with the properties of the hirota derivative it is a simple task to nd the following explicit
solution

0 =

1 =

2e(2+2)r  (3 + 4)er + (3 + 2)e(1+2)r

(3 + 2)(3 + 4)

(3 + 2)e(1+2)r  (3 + 4)er + 2e(2+2)r

(3 + 2)(3 + 4)

.

(60)

as claimed above, we see that there is only an exponential dependence on r; this corre-
sponds to the fact that hyperbolic monopoles approach the vacuum value exponentially,
rather than algebraically like euclidean monopoles.

taking the limit   0 this solution becomes

0 =

2
9

(e2r  (3r + 1)er),

1 =

2
9

((3r  1)er + e2r)

(61)

so we see the emergence of the algebraic factors. substituting (61) into (55) we obtain the
euclidean monopole solution given by (44).

where 1 = 3 = 1.

as an example we give the solution for minimal symmetry breaking with 0 = diag(3,1,1,1),

which is

0 = 3

vii. conclusion

18

we have studied in some detail the construction of su(n) monopoles from
scattering data which consists of a rational map of the riemann sphere into a ag manifold.
explicit solutions have been obtained in the case of spherical symmetry and we have shown
how these solutions involve harmonic maps of the plane into cipn 1. this approach was
generalized to the case of hyperbolic monopoles and new spherically symmetric solutions
found, whose zero curvature limit was investigated explicitly.

the jarvis equation is integrable, but in this paper we have made no use of the lax
pair. the precise description of the boundary conditions in terms of the rational map
makes this a very convenient formulation of the bogomolny equation and it may prove
useful to undertake a classical inverse scattering study. an alternative, which is currently
under investigation, is the numerical solution of the jarvis equation, which is more promis-
ing than a numerical solution of the bogomolny equation since the boundary conditions
can be specied in a simple manner to ensure the existence of a unique solution.

appendix

solutions of the equation

let p (z, z) be a 2  2 hermitian projector. in this appendix we prove that the only
(a.1)

(p pz)z = 0

are the -model instantons given by

let f = p pz, then using the fact that p is a projector, which is a solution of (a.1), it is
clear that f satises the following properties

p pz = 0.

(a.2)

fz = 0
p f = f
f p = 0.

(a.3)
(a.4)
(a.5)

taking (a.4) with (a.5) gives that f 2 = 0, so that it has at most rank one and can be
written as

f = uw

19

(a.6)

where u and w are two orthogonal column vectors, that is wu = 0. substituting this
expression for f into (a.3) and multiplying both sides by w leads to the result that wuz =
0, that is, uz is orthogonal to w. but since we already know that u is orthogonal to w and
they are elements of a two-dimensional vector space then this implies that u and uz are

parallel. thus u must have the form u(z, z) = g(z, z)eu(z), where eu is a holomorphic vector

p is a hermitian projector so it may be written as

and g is some function.

p =

vv
vv

(a.7)

for some 2-component column vector v. substituting the expressions (a.6) and (a.7) into
property (a.4) shows that u and v are parallel, that is, v = u for some function . now

using the earlier factorization of u we obtain v = geu, so that nally we arrive at the result

that

.

p = eueu
eueu

as we have already shown that eu is a holomorphic vector then this is an instanton solution

of equation (a.2) (see for example ref. [10]) and the required result is proved.
