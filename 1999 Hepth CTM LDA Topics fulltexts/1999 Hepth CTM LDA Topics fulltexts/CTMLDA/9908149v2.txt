abstract

we analyze the high temperature (or classical) limit of the casimir eect. a useful
quantity which arises naturally in our discussion is the relative casimir energy, which we de-
ne for a conguration of disjoint conducting boundaries of arbitrary shapes, as the dierence of
casimir energies between the given conguration and a conguration with the same boundaries
innitely far apart. using path integration techniques, we show that the relative casimir energy
vanishes exponentially fast in temperature. this is consistent with a simple physical argument
based on kirchhos law. as a result the relative casimir entropy, which we dene in an
obviously analogous manner, tends, in the classical limit, to a nite asymptotic value which
depends only on the geometry of the boundaries. thus the casimir force between disjoint pieces
of the boundary, in the classical limit, is entropy driven and is governed by a dimensionless
number characterizing the geometry of the cavity. contributions to the casimir thermodynam-
ical quantities due to each individual connected component of the boundary exhibit logarithmic
deviations in temperature from the behavior just described. these logarithmic deviations seem
to arise due to our diculty to separate the casimir energy (and the other thermodynamical
quantities) from the electromagnetic self-energy of each of the connected components of the
boundary in a well dened manner. our approach to the casimir eect is not to impose sharp
boundary conditions on the uctuating eld, but rather take into consideration its interaction
with the plasma of charge carriers in the boundary, with the plasma frequency playing the
role of a physical uv cuto. this also allows us to analyze deviations from a perfect conductor
behavior.

1 introduction

there has been considerable interest in the casimir eect [1] lately[2]. recent discus-

sions of this eect and its variants range over several areas of physics [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

9, 10, 11]. for recent books and reviews see [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. for earlier accounts

see [17, 18].

the experimental status of the eect was tenuous until 1997 when vindication of

the theoretical prediction to an accuracy of a few percent was reported [19].

over the years, various methods have been applied to analyze the casimir eect.

to name a few, we mention the mode summation technique [12, 13, 17, 18] (which

was the method originally used by casimir), analyses of greens functions and of the

energy-momentum tensor in the presence of boundaries [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] and

zeta function techniques [27, 28]. these techniques possess exibility which permits,

among other things, the handling of temperature dependence (in vacuum and in

dielectrics) [20, 21, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34], of elds with nite mass [31, 35], various

geometrical setups [5, 6, 7, 8, 22, 24, 25, 32, 33, 36, 37], and a better insight into the

casimir force (macroscopic) in relation to microscopic long range forces [14].

finally, we mention here the path integral approach [5, 6, 7, 8, 38] which seems

to be well suited to handle systems with boundaries of arbitrary shape as well as

systems with moving boundaries [39].

an important aspect of the casimir eect is its behavior at nite temperatures.

finite temperature studies were carried out by several authors, e.g., [20, 21, 26, 29,

30, 31, 34]. in particular, we mention in this context the thorough analysis by balian

and duplantier [32], who used multiple scattering expansions to study the casimir

eect at nite temperature in the presence of conducting boundaries of arbitrary

smooth shapes. one of the several issues studied in [32] was the classical (i.e., high

temperature) limit of the eect (see section 6 in [32]).

in this paper we address the classical (or high temperature) limit of the casimir

eect due to boundaries of arbitrary shapes using path integration. our results are

in agreement with those of [32]. the classical limit is attained upon subtraction of

1

the self-energies of the boundaries. the need of this subtraction for obtaining the

classical limit of the casimir eect leasds us to dene in (section 2 of ) this paper

what we call the relative casimir free-energy, the relative casimir energy and

the relative casimir entropy. in fact, based on kirchhos law, we can explain the

classical limit of the casimir eect intuitively in terms of these newly dened relative

quantities.

to get oriented, let us briey review (hopefully in a self contained manner) the

standard casimir problem, viz., radiation eld conned between two parallel conduct-

ing plates, at zero and at nite temperature. we will write down explicit expressions

for the casimir energy, free energy and entropy. these are displayed in fig. 1, which

gives the behavior of these quantities for all temperatures. at the end of this sec-

tion we will discuss the classical limit of the casimir eect in this simple geometry.

(readers familiar with these standard aspects of the casimir eect may skip directly

to the next section, but are urged to take a look in fig. 1 on the way.) in appendix

c we present an alternative treatment of this problem, based on the path integral

formalism, following closely [5, 7, 8].

for simplicity, we will employ, for the rest of this section, the so called mode

summation technique. (for more details see, e.g., [10, 12, 13, 17, 18]. here we follow

closely [10].) we consider the radiation eld (in 3+1 space-time dimensions) conned

between two conducting parallel plates. (in later sections, where we discuss the high

temperature limit of the casimir eect for cavities of arbitrary shapes, we will limit

ourselves to massless scalar elds1 for simplicity.) the sizes of the plates edges are

l. the parallel plates coincide with the planes at z = 0 and z = d. we are interested
of course in the case where l >> d, and in the end will take the limit l  .

the energy tied down in zero point uctuations in the mode k is, in obvious

1this simplication does not spoil the agreement between our results and the results in section

6 of [32] which discusses the electromagnetic case.

both (0) and (0) diverge. c is commonly [1, 12, 17] evaluated by a physically

justiable regularization technique. thus a wave vector dependent function, r(k/kc),
is introduced into the above integrals such that for k >> kc r  0 while r  1 for
k << kc, thereby rendering the integrals convergent. a simple choice is ( = 1/kc),

r(k) = exp [k] .

thus the sum is regularized. the details of the calculations will not be given here

(cf.

[10, 17, 18].) in appendix c, where we present an alternative analysis of this

problem, we employ a dierent regularization scheme for the casimir energy, which

seems to us more natural physically.

the result for our case is

(12)

returning to our dimensionless units we may write the energy density as a sum of a

(15)

(16)

observe that for dimensional reasons, (d, t ), u(d, t ) and n(y, t ) (as well as all the

other thermodynamical quantities which we will dene below) depend on d and t
through the combination t d  t /tc only. thus, in particular, (d, t = 0) = (0) is
independent of d.

we see from (15) that tc plays the role of a characteristic (or lower cuto) tem-

perature of the geometrical setting, separating high and low temperatures. the cor-

responding expression for the unconstrained system is

(, t ) = (0) + u(, t ),

(17)

with

u(, t ) =

evaluating the sum in (14) via the poisson summation formula [10, 17] gives ( =

as a consistency check we observe that for t << 1, c  c(0), the expression
in (8). the nite temperature casimir energy c(t), i.e., the dierence between the

expectation values of the hamiltonians of the constrained and unconstrained systems,

is displayed in fig.1.

the casimir free energy is calculated as follows: the partition function (for one

mode) is



zk =

xn=1

exp [hk(n + 1/2)] =

exp [hk/2]

and thus the free energy for the k-th mode is

fk = kbt log zk =

hk + kbt log(1  exp [hk]) .

hence the expression for the free energy density of the constrained system is

f (d, t ) = e(d, 0) + kbt

(21)

a corresponding equation holds for the unconstrained system, thereby leading to the

dimensionless expression for the casimir free energy density, c, given by

where d was dened in (3), and

fc(t ) = dc(t),

c(t) = 2t

(22)

(23)

the casimir free energy, c(t), is displayed in fig. 1. as a check, note that for
t << 1, c(t)  c(0), as it should.

at this juncture it is natural to consider casimirs entropy [10, 21]. this entropy,

c(t), is dened in our dimensionless units by

c(t) = c(t)  tc(t).

(24)

c(t) is displayed in fig. 1.

at high temperatures, t >> 1, c(t) falls o exponentially with t, c(t) approaches

a constant value (independent of t and, of course, of h) while c(t) becomes propor-

tional to t. (an explicit calculation of this behavior is deferred to appendix a.) re-

expressing these results in standard physical dimensions we get, at this limit (t >> 1)

ec  0, fc  tsc, sc

(25)

thus the entropy is proportional to the area of the plates scaled by d2. in view of

this fact we conclude that in the classical limit (high temperatures) the casimir force

is purely entropic.

function of temperature, t. note that graphs (a) and (b) coincide at energy 0.0028 
1/360, consistent with (8).

it is clear from fig. 1 that the casimir energy vanishes at high temperatures (and

according to (18) it vanishes exponentially fast). this, we contend, characterizes the

classical limit where the energy equipartition theorem and the validity of the one

to one correspondence between the states of the constrained system and the states

of the unconstrained system imply this result. this is discussed in more detail in

section 2.

this concludes the general introductory review. the rest of the paper is organized

as follows. section 2 includes the central point of the paper, viz., an exposition

of the classical limit and a study of its implications.

it is based on the argument

that the known [9] one to one correspondence between states of constrained systems

and essentially free ones implies the vanishing of the casimir energy. this is a

somewhat subtle issue. to be precise, what vanishes in the classical limit is what we

dene as the relative casimir energy, namely, the casimir energy associated with a

given disconnected set of boundaries, from which we subtract the casimir energy for

a system in which all these boundaries are innitely separated from one another. in

particular, this statement does not hold for a boundary made of a single connected

7

piece. in contrast, the relative casimir entropy does not vanish in the classical limit.

we also summarize in section 2 the high temperature results of section 6 of [32],

which support these assertions about the classical limit for systems constrained by

conducting boundaries of arbitrary smooth shapes.

in section 3 we study, in the

path integral formalism, the casimir eect associated with a massless scalar eld

(x) (as a simple analog of the electromagnetic eld), conned in a static reecting

cavity of arbitrary shape. section 3 is divided into several subsections. in section

3.1 we study the zero temperature eect. first, we review the formalism of [5, 7, 8]

assuming sharp boundary conditions on all frequency modes (section 3.1.1). these

boundary conditions on the eld modes are of course an approximate macroscopic

manifestation of the interaction of the plasma of charge carriers that live in

the conducting boundary, with the eld , in the limit that the boundary is a perfect

conductor. thus, in section 3.1.2 we adopt a more realistic approach and take into

account the susceptibility of the boundary medium, with its plasma frequency p

playing the role of a physical uv cuto.

in the limit of innite p we recover, of

course, the eect of sharp boundary conditions. however, by keeping p large but

nite, we can also calculate corrections to the casimir eect due to deviations from

perfect conductor behavior.

in section 3.2 we discuss the nite temperature case.

the relevant temperature range is kbt << hp.

in section 3.2.1 we study the

classical limit kbtc < kbt << hp, where tc is a lower (ir) cuto temperature

analogous to (16). for this model, we are able to verify the arguments of section 2,

that the classical limit for this system results in a vanishing (relative) casimir energy

and a geometry dependent (relative) casimir entropy. this we can do only when the

boundaries are made of disjoint pieces. we nd that contributions to the casimir free

energy and entropy due to each connected component of the boundary individually

exhibit logarithmic deviations in temperature from the behavior just described. in

the conclusions which are given in section 4 we review the argument (cf. [12]) for the

existence of zero point uctuations as viewed from our vantage point.

some technical details are relegated to the appendices. in appendix a we provide

8

an explicit calculation of the exponential fall-o of c(t) seen in fig.1 (which we

mentioned following eq. (24)). we show that a naive high temperature expansion

for the casimir energy in powers of 1/t does not have any corrections to the classical

value.

in appendix b we verify the consistency of p(t = 0) as a uv cuto at

high temperatures. appendix c provides a derivation of the casimir eect for the

canonical parallel plate geometry via the path integral formalism of section 3. we

obtain all the results of section 1 at zero and nite temperature, as well as the classical

limit. appendix d contains some technical details concerning bounds on terms in a

certain expansion we carry out in section 3.

9

2 the classical limit - discussion

an intuitive understanding of the vanishing of the casimir energy of the parallel plate

geometry for t > tc ( cf. fig. 1) may be gained via the following reasoning. loosely

speaking [9] the total number of normal modes (per unit volume) in our conned

system is unchanged upon changing d (in the case under study in section 1).2 thus

moving the walls adiabatically leads to shifts in the levels - not to appearance (or

disappearance) of levels (modes), and there is an (intuitive) one to one correspondence

between the levels regardless of the size of d. this, coupled with the classically valid

equipartitioning of energy, which of course means that each harmonic oscillator-like

mode holds kbt amount of energy, implies that the (bulk) energy density (in this

classical limit) is unchanged upon changing d.

thus, in the classical limit, dened by the validity of the rayleigh jeans (rj) law

or the equipartioning of the energy [40], the dierence in the energy density between
the constrained (d << l) and the unconstrained (d  l) cases, namely, the casimir
energy, is nil.

thus we have, in conformity with the result of the exact calculations as exhibited

in fig. 1, that,

c(d, t ) = 0.

lim

(26)

these considerations are readily generalizable to systems made of several disjoint

conducting boundaries of arbitrary shapes (the parallel plate geometry being an ex-

ample of such a system). in the next section we will prove, by an explicit calculation,
that the relative casimir energy e rel

ization scheme employed there).

c (t ) = 0 ,

(28)

where tc is a characteristic temperature of the constrained system, analogous to (16).

(we tacitly assume that tc is the maximal parameter of this kind, if several such

parameters are needed to describe the constrained system.)

in discussions of black body radiation, kirchhos law (that the ratio of emissiv-

ity to absorptivity of all bodies is a universal function of the wavelengh  and the

temperature t ) is used [12] to infer that u, the total electromagnetic energy density

in a cavity at thermal equilibrium, is a function of t only,

u = u(t ) .

(29)

in particular, it means that u(t ) is independent of the shape of the cavity. it is clear

that (29) is true only for t > tc. (e.g., at t = 0 it is, strictly speaking, never true.)
for this reason we refer to (28) as kirchhos theorem.3

coming back to the parallel plate geometry, it follows from (28), via (25), that
the casimir force fc = fc/d between the plates is purely entropic in the classical
limit. furthermore, in this limit, the casimir entropy sc (dened as the dierence in
entropies between the constrained and free systems) is independent of temperature

and is, hence, purely geometric [10].

more generally, as a result of kirchhos theorem (28), the casimir forces be-

tween disconnected boundaries become purely entropic in the classical limit. con-
sequently, the relative casimir entopy srel
plate case) as the dierence

c (t ), dened (in analogy with the parallel

between the casimir entropy sc associated with a given disconnected set of bound-
aries, and the casimir entropy s

3that u (t ) depends on the shape of the cavity at low temperature, which thus sets limitations
on the validity of kirchhos law, is of course well known. see, e.g., the comment made on p. 78 in
[41].

11

innitely separated from one another (but are otherwise unchanged), becomes, in the

classical limit, independent of temperature and hence, purely geometric.

this is consistent, of course, with physical intuition, because at temperatures

t >> tc the dominant contribution to entropy is from short wavelength modes
(  1/t ). these are insensitive to the boundaries when the dimension of the cavity
much exceeds these wavelengths [42]. this dominant contribution to the total en-

tropy cancels out when one calculates the casimir entropy, namely, the dierence in

entropies between the unconstrained and constrained systems. the leading contribu-

tion to the casimir entropy, then, is essentially determined by the long wavelengths

which are geometry dependent, i.e., which relate to the shape of the cavity and are

independent of temperature.

let us formalize this argument somewhat further: the entropy of a non-interacting

bose gas, such as the gas of photons conned in the cavity, is

s(t ) =

1
t

d ()"

h

eh  1  kbt log (cid:16)1  eh(cid:17)# ,

(31)

where () is the (extensive) density of modes. thus, for photons (inside a very large

volume v ) f ree() = v 2/2c3, whereas for radiation modes between the parallel

plates of the previous section[9]

() = (c/d)f ree()"1/2 +

((d/c)  n)# ,



xn=1

and so on.

based on (31) we can express the casimir entropy as

sc(t ) =

eh  1  kbt log (cid:16)1  eh(cid:17)# .

(32)

clearly, the density of modes () in the cavity diers signicantly from the den-

sity of modes f ree() of the free system only at long wavelengths, i.e., they dier

signicantly only for frequencies below some ir cuto frequency c which is deter-

mined by the shape of the cavity. thus, the spectral integral in (32) is dominated by

12

 < c. this allows us to dene the high temperature (classical) limit as such that
h < hc  tc/t << 1. in this limit (and due to the fact that   f ree cuts the

are equal (due to the correspondence between states), but innite.

an obvious feature of (38) and (40) is the absence of a term proportional to the

this is peculiar to electromagnetic uctuations, due to cancellation between electric

and magnetic modes.5 in the case of uctuations of a relativistic massless scalar eld,

for example, which we discuss in section 3, balian and bloch6 showed that

where the  sign occurs for dirichlet boundary conditions and the + sign, for neu-

from these considerations we see that the casimir entropy in the classical limit,

as given by (37), depends on the geometry of the boundaries, but it also depends

logarithmically on temperature.

it is not just a geometric dependent constant as

required by kirchhos theorm. the casimir entropy (37) can be derived in the

usual manner from the casimir free energy

fc  ct log kbt

h ! ,

(42)

which is precisely the high temperature expression obtained in [32] via the mutiple

scattering expansion. we can interpret (42) as the high temperature limit of the free
energy of c non-interacting harmonic oscillators of frequency . from (42) we thus
nd that the casimir energy is

ec =

(fc)

(43)

5for more details, see section 4 (and in particular, sections 4.2 and 4.3) in [32].
6see eq.(1.7) in the rst reference cited in [33]. our () is 2 times the expression in [33].
7the fact that dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions induce opposite signs for the area
term in (41) is essentially the reason why, in the case of electromagnetic uctuations, the area term
contributions of electric and magnetic modes cancel each other.

14

and it does not vanish. it is of course a statement of classical equipartition: according
to (35) we can interpret c as the number of additional modes of nite frequency
created by introducing the conducting boundaries, each of which carries thermal

energy kbt .

how do we reconcile these high temperature behaviors of sc,ec and fc with our
expectations of the classical limit? it is at this point that the relative thermodynamic

quantities which we dened above become useful: it is clear from the explicit formulas
(38) and (40) that c depends only on the geometrical features of each individual con-
nected piece of the boundary, as well as on the overall topology of their arrangement

in space, but not on the relative distances and orientations of these components. (on

the other hand, it is clear from [32] that the average frequency , does depend on the

the relative distances and orientations of these components; otherwise, there will be

no casimir forces between them.) thus, we immediately conclude that the relative

casimir entropy (30) tends in the classical limit to

>>1srel
lim

c = c log  ()

(44)

(where () is the average frequency (36) of the system with all boundaries far
apart), which indeed depends only on the geometry of the boundaries. similarly,
the relative casimir energy (27), e rel
c (t ), vanishes in the classical
limit, because the constrained system in which all the same disjoint boundaries are
innitely far apart, has the same coecient c. kirchhos theorem (28) holds.

c (t ) = ec(t )  e

it follows then that the relative casimir free energy f rel

between the casimir free energy of the constrained system and a system with the

limit,

hence, the casimir forces between disjoint boundaries are purely entropic in the

(46)

classical limit, as was mentioned above. this reasoning is born out by the explicit

calculations presented in the next section and in appendices a and c.

an interesting point to note is that sign of c can be either positive or negative8, as
should be clear from the explicit expressions (38) and (40)[32]. for example, a single
toral boundary will have a positive c if the hole in the center of the torus is very
small (i.e., if the torus is a very fat tube), or if the torus is very narrow compared

to the radius of the hole (i.e., the torus is a very thin tube). a torus inbetween
these domains, will have a negative c.
that the classical relative entropy srel
be positive, and, also, that the casimir forces between the disjoint boundaries may

(44) (being a dierence of entropies) need not

(for more details see [32].) this means

c

be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the geometry (and topology) of the
boundary pieces. (the signs of srel

and of the forces depend of course also on .)

c

we are now in a position to interpret the zero point energy (zpe) as a contribution

necessary to assure that at high temperatures , the energy, u, is a function of t only

as, indeed, was noted long ago (in 1913) by einstein and stern ([12], p.2): without

it the energy will depend on the boundaries. alternatively, if we assume the validity

of kirchhos theorem at high temperatures, we may deduce the zero temperature

(relative) casimir energy as follows.

let us write the energy per mode k of the radiation eld (constrained between

several disjoint boundaries) as

ek(t ; tc) = ek(0; tc) + e

k(t ; tc)

(47)

where e

k is the energy held in the mode without the zpe. for an allowed mode k

e

k(t ; tc) =

hk

exp(hk)  1

(48)

(see (11)). similarly, we denote the analogous quantities for the system with the

same boundaries far apart as e

k (t ) and e


k (t ), respectively. the relative casimir

energy is then

e rel
c (t ; tc) = xk

ek(t ; tc) xk

e

k (t ).

(49)

8the dierence in mode densities () (34) need not be positive denite.

16

use of (47) ( i.e., separating the thermal energy from the vacuums) and kirchhos

theorem (28) implies

(51)

now both terms in the square bracket are readily calculable - their temperature

dependence assures convergence - and thus yield the relative casimir energy at t = 0

without recourse to a (perhaps) objectionable regularization scheme.

to summarize, the validity, in the classical limit, of kirchhos theorem (28)

implies that, in this limit, the relative casimir entropy is independent of the temper-

ature t (and obviously, of plancks constant h), and is thus a geometry dependent

quantity that characterizes the constraints. further, its validity allows a novel way

to evaluate the t = 0 value of the casimir energy, as we discussed above.

17

3 classical limit for arbitrary geometry

our discussion of the classical limit of the casimir eect concentrated so far on

one concrete example, namely, the parallel plates geometry. however, the intuitive

physical argument presented in the previous section for the vanishing of the casimir

energy in the classical limit is quite general and does not seem to depend in any

specic manner on the particular geometric details of the parallel plates system.

thus, we expect that it should be possible to supplement this argument by an explicit

calculation of the classical limit of the casimir eect for a cavity of arbitrary shape.

in this section we carry out such a calculation, using path integration techniques.

some technical details are deferred to appendices b-d. from this point onward, we

reset h, c and kb to 1, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

3.1 zero temperature analysis

in order to set up the formalism we start with the zero temperature case. for sim-

plicity, we concentrate on a real massless scalar eld with action

s = z d4x

1
2

((x))2 ,

(52)

instead of the electromagnetic eld. (discussion of the electrodynamic casimir eect

follows essentially the same lines.) we assume that the eld is conned within a static

cavity of an arbitrary shape and is constrained to vanish on its boundary , which

may consist of several disjoint pieces. in addition, we assume that the curvature of

 is regular everywhere.

3.1.1 sharp boundary conditions over all modes

following [5, 7, 8], we parametrize the world-volume swept out by our static  as

x0 = t; x = x(u)

(53)

where u = (u1, u2) are internal coordinates on .

18

the in-vacuum to out-vacuum transition amplitude z associated with (52) with

(x) constrained to vanish on (53) is given by

zc =

1

z0 z d yx

 [(t, x(u))] exp

i

2 z d4x ()2

with normalization

z0 = z d exp

i

2 z d4x ()2 .

(54)

(55)

we chose to normalize (54) relative to the unconstrained system, since, after all, we

are interested only in the dierence of the ground state energies.

following [5] we write

 [(t, x(u))] = z d(t, u) exp iz dt z

yx

d2ug(t, u) (t, x(u)) .

(56)

here

g =   x

u1!2  x

is the determinant of the induced metric on .

since  is static, it is convenient to resolve  and  into frequency modes as

and (t, x) =



z

(x) eit

(58)

(with

substituting (56) in (54) and using (58) we have

(59)

we may summarize (56) and (59) by saying that the  act as sources for the


, which live on . integration over these sources constrains all modes  (i.e., low
frequency modes as well as high frequency modes) to vanish on . this is, obviously,

an idealized situation, e.g., if we try to take (52) more seriously as a simplied version

of the electrodynamic case. indeed, it is well known that real metals are transparent
to radiation of frequency   p, where p is the plasma frequency of the metal in

19

question (which typically lies in the uv region). low frequency modes (i.e., modes

with  < p), on the other hand, penetrate the surface of the conductor only to within

a distance of order 1/p (the skin depth) and are otherwise excluded from the bulk

of the conductor. thus, as is well known, the perfect conductor boundary condition

that all modes (x) vanish on , is an eective description (or a consequence) of the

microscopic interactions of  and its sources  in the medium, where we assume
p  . the plasma frequency p serves as an eective uv cuto frequency for the
casimir eect. in the next sub-section we will treat this issue in some detail. one

of the benets of doing so, besides gaining better physical understanding, is that the

formalism we follow will enable us to calculate deviations from a perfect conductor

behavior in a straightforward manner.

3.1.2 more realistic interactions at the boundary

thus, to make our model more realistic, we should really think of the conducting

surface  as having some thickness w of a few 1/p. (in doing so we make the tacit

assumption that local curvature radii everywhere on  are much larger than 1/p.)
we denote this thickened three dimensional conductor b. only modes of frequency
 < p are constrained to decay into b. modes of frequency  > p will not be
subjected to such a boundary condition. this physical behavior should be taken into

account in (59).

thus, we replace (52) by the action

s =

1

2 z d3xz d

2



(x)h2(, x) + 2i (x) ,

where, in analogy with electrodynamics, we introduced the dielectric function

(60)

(61)

with susceptibility (), which encodes the polarization eects due to the   
interactions in b.

(, x) = 


1 + 4(), x  b
x / b

1,

20

as discussed in the previous section, the cavity bounded by b has an ir cuto
frequency c, which obviously sets the scale for frequencies that dominate the casimir

eect. we assume henceforth that the ratio p/c is large but nite so as to leave a

wide window open between the two cuto frequencies. for the parallel plate capacitor

of section 1, with plate separation d, we have of course

c = /d .

(62)

then the condition p/c = pd/ >> 1 means that we are allowed to use the perfect

conductor boundary conditions only for plate separation d in the range

d >> 0.06m  10ev

hp ! .

(63)

if we decrease the plates separation d below what is allowed by (63), c would tend

to p until it would eventually cross it over. field modes around c would penetrate

yet deeper into the boundary, until it would become eectively transparent to these

modes, rendering the boundary conditions less eective. thus, we expect that if our
modied model (as given by (60) and (61)) could still be trusted when p/c  1,
then the 1/d4 behavior of the casimir force (10) would crossover to a less divergent
behavior. in fact, assuming (64) for (), we can show that the casimir force behaves
like 1/d3 for d below the range allowed by (63) [29] (see also [12], p.230).

current experiments are performed (albeit not in the parallel plate geometry)
with d  0.1m[19]. obviously, it would be interesting to check experimentally
(when technology would allow performing such experiments) how the casimir force

behaves at such much smaller distances (which are yet large enough on the atomic

scale).

in addition to (63), we assume that c is large enough, so that for   c we may

21

neglect all resonances and dissipative eects encoded in , and thus write9

4() = 

2
p
2 ,

(64)

in direct analogy with the theory of dielectrics. (in reality, this corresponds to fre-

quencies in the infrared and higher. in the case of the parallel plate capacitor, tuning

c to the infrared, means plate separation d around 1m.)

with (64) for , the action (60) is equivalent to

s =

 develops a nite mass p inside b and is thus expelled from it.10 moreover, we see
from (65) that in the limit p   of a perfect conductor, (x) tends to vanish on
.

()  1 = 4() in (60) is, of course, the greens function (at k = 0) of the
source eld  (already mentioned after (59)), that lives in b. thus, (60) is equivalent
to

sef f =

1

2 z d

2 (z d3x 

h2 + 2i  +zb

42()



thus, we replace (59) by

zc =

1

z0z z y0dd exp isef f ,

+ (

  + h.c.)#) .

(67)

(68)

9following elementary dispersion theory, we may take (as the simplest example) () =
/( + i). the simple pole at  = 0 corresponds, of course, to b being a conductor, with con-
ductivity  and damping coecient  = 2
p/4. our second assumption is simply that c >> .
more generally, we assume that c is much bigger than the highest resonance frequency and largest
damping coecient appearing in . finally, note that the analytic structure of () insures that
the path integral over (60) is well dened, namely, re(is) < 0 always.

10long ago, anderson [45] pointed out that the electrodynamical analogs of (65) and (66) may serve
as a low energy, non-relativistic example of dynamical mass generation of gauge elds, analogous to
mass generation in the schwinger model or to the higgs phenomenon.

(69)

with (64), the quadratic piece in  in (67) is +||2/2

perfect conductor, +||2/2
back into , and (68) reduces to (59) (as we already commented following (66)).

p. in the limit p   of a
p goes away, the thickened conducting surface b shrinks

observe that in our discussion of the casimir eect in sections 1 and 2, and in this

section up to (59), we did not make any reference to the ne structure constant  (or
its analog, associated with the  coupling in b). however, since 2
p is proportional
to , it rightfully sneaks into our discussion following the modied action (60), or

equivalently, (67). given this, we should, in principle, include the  interaction (or

analogously, the photon-electron interactions) also in the bulk part of the action in

(67), taking into account the full dynamics of the source eld . this would imply

using below the renormalized  (or photon) propagator in the bulk (for such radiative

corrections in the casimir eect see, e.g.,[38]). however, such eects are small and

we ignore them in this paper.

eqs. (67) and (68) capture some aspects of the dynamics of  (and thus, in a

sense, of the dynamics of the boundaries where  lives), rendering our formalism more

realistic as it relaxes the constraints on higher frequency modes and thus regularizes

the theory. one aspect of this regularization is that the two dimensional surface
 becomes fuzzy and swells into a shell b of nite width.
should also mention a recent work by ford and svaiter [11] which also takes boundary

in this context we

dynamics into consideration, but in a dierent (and presumably complementary) way.

in [11] the boundary as a whole is quantized - its location serves as a collective heavy

coordinate which sits in its ground state (at t = 0) and is thus not sharply dened.

this quantum uncertainty in the boundary location also regularizes the theory since it

cures an old problem having to do with divergences of the energy density near sharply

dened boundaries (see, e.g. the work by candelas and deutsch (1979) in [39]). the

idea is simple: if the eld vanishes on a sharply dened surface, its momentum at all

points on the surface is unbounded due to the uncertainty principle, rendering the

23

eld energy density singular on the surface. if the location of the boundary has zero

point uctuations, the eld at the (fuzzy) boundary is not sharply constrained, and

the eld energy density is no longer singular.

in the spirit of [5, 7, 8] we would like now to integrate  out of (68). to this end

it is useful to extend the denition of the sources  from b into all space as

(x)  


(x), x  b
x / b .

0,

(70)

in terms of these extended sources, clearly all spatial integrals in (67) involving ,

including the  interaction term, are carried over all space. thus, integrating 
out is straightforward and produces a factor z0, which cancels the corresponding
normalization factor in (68). we end up with

(72)

in order to proceed, we recall at this point that b is essentially the thickened
two dimensional conducting surface , with normal width w of a few skin depths
l/p (l  o(1)). thus, we parametrize b by

x = x(u, w) ,

where u are the two internal coordinates of  (see (53)), and w is the coordinate in

the direction normal to . we are interested, of course, in the limit of large p, or

very small width w. clearly, in this limit  (as well as ) do not uctuate in the

normal direction. consequently we may write the -quadratic action in (71) as

here t (implicit in the product in the rst line of (75)), is a temporal ir cuto which

thus integration over it yields a square root of the appropriate determinant. this is
taken care of in the last expression in (75), where we used m = m. the casimir

(76)

eq. (76) is one of our main results and we will use it to infer the classical (high

temperature) limit of the casimir eect in the next sub-section.

note that if  is the union of several disjoint two dimensional surfaces  ( =
1, 2,   n), where  has local coordinates u() and induced metric g(), then obvi-
ously  is the sum

([5] actually discusses the most generic case where the eld lives in d + 1 dimensions

and is constrained to vanish on several manifolds  of various dimensions, some

of which may be time dependent.)

in particular, for the parallel plate geometry

discussed in the previous sections (1 is the z = 0 plane and 2 is the z = d plane),

a straightforward calculation yields [5, 7, 8]

m =   1

(80)

if we let p tend to innity in (76) we obtain the casimir energy of the perfect

conductor , identical (up to an innite additive constant proportional to the area

of ) to the casimir energy one may calculate directly from (59).

in particular,

substituting (79) in (76) yields (after proper regularization, and up to an obvious

factor 1/2) the casimir energy (8).

however, keeping p large but nite, we may calculate corrections to the casimir

eect due to imperfect conductor behavior by expanding (76) in inverse powers of p.

such calculations were made in [30] using greens function techniques. in appendix

c, following [5, 7, 8] (and the formalism presented in this section), we briey sketch

the calculation of the casimir force at zero and nite temperatures for the parallel

plate capacitor using (79). we also calculate in appendix c the leading (in 1/p)

correction to the casimir eect due to imperfect conductor behavior for the parallel

plate capacitor, which coincides with the results of [30] and [46].

26

3.2 finite temperature behavior and the classical limit

the nite temperature case is obtained, in the usual manner, from the zero temper-

ature case of the previous sub-section, by continuing  to imaginary values, where

it can take only the discrete matsubara frequencies n = 2n/. consequently, we

replace continuous integrals

n= (with  = 1/t ).
obviously, since p plays the role of a uv cuto, we must sum only over |n| < p.
we show in appendix b that the physics of the electron fermi gas in the metal

d/2 by discrete sums (1/)p



r

actually warrants 1 << p, so that these discrete sums include many terms, and

also that we may ignore the t dependence of p. these facts indicate that our

cuto procedure, using (61) and (64), is physically consistent also at nite and high

temperatures.

under the analytic continuation   i, the oscillatory exponentials in (72) and
(74) are replaced by decaying exponentials. thus for nite temperature we replace
m by

mn(u, u) = qg(u)

e|n| |x(u)x(u)|

4 |x(u)  x(u)| qg(u) ,

(81)

(as well as a similar replacement for m
 in (78)). we also introduce the obvious
notational replacement m  mn. note that in the euclidean domain, mn is not
only symmetric, but also real.

in particular, note that at nite temperature we must replace (79) and (80) of the

parallel plate capacitor by

mn =   1
edhn

edhn
1 ! 1
2hn

(82)

with hn = q2

n  2

x  2
y .

finally, we analytically continue (75) to imaginary  (and also replace t   in

(75)) and obtain the partition function as



zc = yn0

27

= exp (

thus, the casimir free energy (the analytic continuation of (76)) is

fc =

log zc =

xn=

tr log h1 + lp mni .

3.2.1 the classical limit

(83)

(84)

our main interest in this paper is of course the high temperature, classical limit of the

casimir eect. recall from section 1 (see in particular fig. 1) that for the parallel

plate capacitor (and electromagnetic elds), the classical limit is

ec  0, fc  tsc, sc 

(3)
23

(

l2
d2 )

(namely, (25), which we repeat here for convenience). as discussed in section 2, it

is supposed to become valid for temperatures t >> tc, where tc = hc/kbd (see

(16)) is a temperature scale dened by geometry. since p is our uv cuto, it is

clear that the relevant temperature range must be far below hp (which corresponds
to  105 ok),

kbtc < kbt << hp ,

(85)

which is consistent with the condition p/c >> 1 (eq. (63)) and also in accordance

with the discussion in appendix b.

according to the general discussion in section 2, we would expect this behavior

to be generic, and occur for cavities of arbitrary shape. thus, we expect that there

should be a temperature scale, which we also denote by tc, which is determined by

the geometry of the cavity, in analogy with (16), and marks the onset of the classical

limit.

in the rest of this section we prove this expectaion for cavities whose boundaries

consist of several disjoint pieces, and also set a bound on tc. cavities bounded by

a single connected boundary are in principle more dicult to handle in this respect,

28

for reasons that we shall explain below. in fact, for such cavities, we found logarith-

mic corrections to (25), which seem to be consistent with the results of balian and

duplantier [32].

we see from (81) that mn(u1, u2) decays exponentially fast, unless

n |x(u1)  x(u2)|  1 .

(86)

in particular, it is clear from (81) and (the analytic continuation of) (78), that for
n  1

where d is the minimal distance between the disjoint pieces  and .

thus, if t = 1/2 is such that 1dmin > 1, where dmin is the minimal d, then
n (for any pair  6= ) will be exponentially small. below
n make exponentially small contributions to the casimir free

all matrix elements of m
we show that these m

21dmin > 1 .

(88)

the o-diagonal blocks of (82) are a clear example of this behavior, for which we

can write the operatorial inequality

end
2n

1 .

(89)

indeed, as we show at the end of appendix c, the high temperature behavior of (89)

oers a very simple explanation of the exponential decay of the casimir energy c(t)

mentioned following (24) (which we derive in appendix a using a laborious mode

summation), and of its corollary that the bulk number of modes per unit volume is

independent of d.

the diagonal blocks of (82) obviously decay only as powers of 1/n. this is in

fact true in general, as we now show. according to (86) we should consider only
neighboring points x(u)  x(u + a), which means that they must belong to the
same  (assuming nite dmin, of course). by continuity then |x(u)  x(u + a)|2

eq. (92) is an asymptotic formula for n  , so for 1/dmin < n << p we
might still have to include many subleading corrections to (92), but the point is that

the diagonal blocks decay only as powers of 1/n.

n

to summarize, when t is high enough so that (88) holds, the o-diagonal blocks
m
( 6= ) become exponentially small (for n 6= 0) , and are thus dominated by
the power-like decaying blocks. thus, it makes sense to split mn (n 6= 0) into its
diagonal and o-diagonal pieces

mn = mn,d + mn,od

(93)

(in obvious notations).

this splitting is not only according to the dierent asymptotic behaviors of mn,d
and mn,od at large n, but also according to their dierent physical interpretations:
consider, for simplicity, a boundary  which is the union of just two disjoint con-

nected pieces 1 and 2. (the following discussion may be generalized immediately

to an arbitrary set of disjoint boundaries .) assume that 1 and 2 are innitely

11note that (90) is the rst term in the expansion 1

separated at rst, and thus do not interact. clearly, in this case, the only non van-
ishing blocks of m are the diagonal ones m11 and m22, that encode the interaction
of the eld  and the corresponding boundary 1 and 2, respectively. by denition,
m11 depends only on the details of 1 and m22 depends only on the details of 2. in
addition, note that the matrix elements dening m11 and m22 (see(74)) are mani-
festly invariant under three dimensional rotations and translations. thus, the spectra
of m11 and m22 are invariant under rigid rotations and translations of 1 and 2,
respectively. then, as 1 and 2 are brought closer together, they start interacting,
and the o-diagonal blocks m12 and m21, which encode this mutual interaction, are
no longer vanishing. as 1 and 2 are drawn closer, the o-diagonal blocks clearly

become larger, while the diagonal blocks remain unchanged. (we could have invoked,
of course, this argument to split m into diagonal and o-diagonal blocks also at
t = 0.) the parallel plate capacitor, with m given by (82), provides a very simple
example for this discussion.

given our system with boundaries 1 and 2, we may study its behavior under in-

nitesimal perturbations. we can perturb the system in two independent ways. one

possibility is to slightly deform any one of the two boundaries (or both), but other-

wise keep the state of the plates relative to each other unchanged. (an innitesimal

self-similar rescaling is an example of such a deformation.) the second possibility

is to move the boundaries rigidly relative to each other, that is, to make a relative

translation or rotation, without changing their shapes. according to the discussion

above, perturbations belonging to the rst possibility will induce changes in the diag-

onal blocks and also in the o-diagonal blocks. perturbations belonging to the second

possibility aect only the o-diagonal blocks. the gradients of the free energy (84)

(or of the casimir energy (76) at t = 0) with respect to these deformations yield the

corresponding casimir forces. again, this is all very clear for the example of the two

plate capacitor.

computation of the energy associated exclusively with the diagonal blocks of m,
that is, the energy of the constrained system with 1 and 2 innitely far apart, poses

31

some conceptual diculties.12 consider 1 for example. its interaction with the eld
 gives rise to the divergent (cuto dependent) quantity tr log m11, which we may
interpret as the energy needed to assemble 1. this energy includes the divergent

self-energy of the charges that make 1 (which is, by denition, a short distance

eect), and interactions among patches of charges on much larger distance scales. the

latter contain the casimir energy we sought. then a conceptual question arises how

to dene a nite physically sensible casimir energy, separate it from the self-energy
and thus extract it from the divergent tr log m11 of 1. as an example, consider 1
to be a spherical shell of radius r (an example that has been and is being studied

extensively in the literature [3, 4, 22, 24, 25, 32, 36, 37, 44]). one may attempt to

dene its casimir energy by comparing the shell with radius r with another shell

with a much larger radius. but as we inate the shell of radius r to compare it

with the other shell, each point on the shell recedes from all the other points on the

shell. in particular, innitesimally separated points on the sphere will recede from one

another too. thus, inating the sphere aects interactions over all distance scales,

and in particular, on the scale of the uv cuto - that is, the self-energy. on top of it

all, and related to the diculty of separating the casimir energy from the self-energy,

there is the more practical question of how to separate the casimir force acting on

our isolated 1 from the total surface tension (and other similar eects), in order to

measure it. this is to be contrasted with what happens when we rigidly move 1 and

2 relative to each other. then all points in 1 move relative to all points on 2, but

there is no relative movement of points within the same , i.e., there is no change of

the self-energy of each of the boundaries. such moves thus induce clear-cut changes

in the casimir energy of the system [8].

having split m into diagonal and o-diagonal blocks according to (93) we expand

the free energy in powers of the o-diagonal part

tr log h1 + lp mni = tr log h1 + lp mn,di

12we adapt here a discussion given in [8].

note that the linear term in mn,od is absent:

mn,od# = 0 .

this expansion (94) is well behaved due to the exponential bound (87) on mn,od, as
we demonstrate in appendix d.

since the leading correction due to mn,od is quadratic, we see from (87) (and from
appendix d) that o-diagonal contributions become exponentially small at temper-

atures t such that 21dmin > 1. this is (88) alluded to above. thus, we expect from

(88) that tc be bounded from below

tc >

.

(95)

for the parallel plate capacitor, for example, with tc given by (16), we have 1/4d =
tc/42.

given a conguration of disjoint boundaries , an interesting quantity is the cost

in free energy (or cost in energy, at t = 0) needed to assemble that conguration

from an initial conguration of the same boundaries, but innitely far apart. in other

words, we would like to study the relative casimir free energy (45), which according

to the discussion above is given by

f rel
c =

1
2



xn= ntr log h1 + lp mni  tr log h1 + lp mn,dio ,

(96)

and is a well dened quantity, not plagued by innite self-energy terms that cancel

between the two terms on the right hand side of (96).

for the parallel plate capacitor, f rel

c

(which we calculate in appendix c), is,

as expected, 1/2 the casimir free energy (22) which was derived in section 1 for

electromagnetic uctuations. thus, more generally, we may interpret (96) as the

casimir free energy (or the casimir energy, at t = 0) due to eld modes that depend

explicitly on the mutual arrangements of the disjoint boundaries. (such modes are

33

to be contrasted, for example, with modes that live inside any of the boundaries 

which is a closed boundary enclosing a cavity. when this  is a perfect conductor,

the latter modes are disconnected from the outer world, and will thus contribute
exclusively to m.)

in (96) that in the classical limit t >> tc becomes proportional to t ,

it is f rel

c

with a proportionality coecient (minus the relative casimir entropy srel
classical limit) which is determined by geometry, in a similar manner to (25). indeed,

(44) in the

c

from (87), (95) and from the explicit bounds (d.1) and (d.2) in appendix d, we see
immediately that for t > 1/(4dmin) all terms in (96) with n 6= 0 are exponentially
small relative to the contribution of the zero mode. thus, in this limit

f rel
c 

t

2 ntr log h1 + lp m0i  tr log h1 + lp m0,dio ,

(97)

with exponentially small corrections. this is the high temperature limit of the relative

casimir free energy, which becomes proportional to t . thus, the relative casimir
energy e rel
c (t ) (27) (i.e., the casimir energy due to eld modes that depend explicitly
on the mutual arrangements of the disjoint boundaries) tends to zero exponentially

fast (at least as fast as e21dmin), and kirchhos theorem (28) holds. thus,

srel
c = 

1

2 ntr log h1 + lp m0i  tr log h1 + lp m0,dio

(98)

is the asymptotic relative casimir entropy (30) (i.e., the high temperature limit of the

casimir entropy due to eld modes that depend explicitly on the mutual arrangements

of the disjoint boundaries). expanding (98) formally in inverse powers of lp we obtain

(99)

it will be very interesting to prove the consistency of (99) (at p  , of course),

and the analog of (44) for scalar eld uctuations.

in appendix c we calculate (97)-(99) for uctuations of the scalar eld in a

parallel plate geometry. as expected, we reproduce there half the classical limit

values of the casimir thermodynamic quantities given in (25) for uctuations of the

34

electromagnetic eld, and also write down explicitly the leading correction in 1/lp

to these quantities.

we end this subsection with a remark concerning the high temperature behavior
of the diagonal blocks of m. (we remind the reader that these diagonal blocks of
mn encode the interactions associated with each surface separately, i.e., when the
dierent surfaces are completely decoupled from each other.) for n large, mn is
dominated by its block diagonal part mn,d and approaches the asymptotic form (92)
1/2n (up to power like corrections in 1/n), and is thus a short distance eect on the

surface, which must be related to the high temperature limit of the electromagnetic

self-energy of the surface. thus, tr log h1 + lp mni tends to

tr log " 1 +

lp

2n! 1# = a log  1 +

lp

2n!  a log   lp

(100)

where a is the total area of all surfaces. thus, fc, the unsubtracted free energy (84),
unlike f rel

, will contain (roughly p/c) terms proportional to

c

at log  lp

t ! .

(101)

this logarithmic behavior of fc (for the scalar eld) is surely akin to the (renormal-
ized, electromagnetic) high temperature casimir free energy (42). since p is the uv

cuto scale, we expect to have renormalization counter terms such as

p!
t log  

that will renormalize (101) into (42). it will be interesting to see this happen in a

concrete calculation.

4 concluding remarks

this paper gives the classical - the high temperature - limit of the casimir eect.

as a start we studied the simple example of the radiation eld conned between

two innite parallel conducting plates separated by a distance d, and found that the

casimir energy vanishes (up to exponentially small corrections) in the classical limit.

from that observation we abstracted an argument that in the classical limit (de-

ned to be temperatures such that the rayleigh-jeans, i.e., energy equipartition,

theorem holds) kirchhos theorem is valid - i.e., the energy density of the radi-

ation eld is a function of temperature only. this implies that, in this limit, the

casimir energy vanishes. we showed that the zero point energy is required to assure

the validity of kirchhos theorem in the classical limit. alternatively, assuming

the validity of the theorem allows the evaluation of the casimir energy at t = 0

without recourse to any regularization scheme. we noted, following [12], that these

results were anticipated by einstein and stern in 1913, prior to the formulation of

modern quantum mechanics and quantum eld theory. these authors noted that

the high temperature expansion of what we now term bose distribution function is

(h << 1)

h

exp(h)  1  kbt 

1
2

h + o(1/t ).

thus we have here a temperature independent term which contributes to the total

energy. its cancellation, i.e., the validity of kirchhos theorem in our presenta-
tion, requires a positive zero point energy, + 1

2h. thus the removal of the zero point
energy by considering a normally ordered hamiltonian does not eliminate the need

for zero point energy. the zero point energy is seen, according to einstein and stern,

to be required for the correct classical limit or, in our terminology, for the validity of

kirchhos theorem. this stems here from the form of the bose distribution rather

than the hamiltonian.

the study of the (casimir) free energy in the classical limit led to demonstrating

36

that the casimir entropy, is (in this limit) a temperature independent constant and

reects nite volume corrections in statistical physics. thereby the proportionality of

the free energy to the temperature t , that is well known [19] is seen to be related to

the rayleigh jeans limit [22] rather indirectly - it is a consequence of the interesting

result that the casimir force in the classical limit is purely entropic - in fact geometric.

it is thence predicted that a large class of casimir free energies, in the high t limit,

will turn out to be proportional to the temperature - reecting the purely entropic

origin of the casimir force in this limit. the crucial point is the existence of one to

one correspondence between states of the constrained and unconstrained systems.

we veried the expected classical limit for the casimir eect due to a massless

scalar eld constrained by a set of disjoint boundaries of arbitrary geometries. this is

achieved by subtracting o the contributions of the eld correlation function that con-

nect a boundary piece with itself without interaction with any other distinct boundary

piece. in other words, our normalization is the partition functions with the boundary

pieces innitly far apart. this removes contributions that are independent of the

inter boundary pieces distances. our analysis allowed us also to include corrections

to the casimir eect due to deviations from perfect conductor behavior.

theorem is exact, i.e., the casimir energy vanishes to all orders in 1/t in this high

temperature expansion. this is interpreted as implying that the classical equipartition

theorem is robust - the classical approximation, once taken, is exact to within power

series corrections. we hasten to add that this is yet another example of incorrect

handling of innities which is further discussed at the end of this appendix.

let us return to the expression for the casimir energy density at nite temper-

(12) and (18), which, in our dimensionless units are summarized by

we now adjunct to each of the above integrals the standard [17, 18] cuto function,

f (xm) = exp [xm] ,

assuring thereby the convergence of the integrals. (we are interested in the   0
limit.)

returning to (a.1), we see that upon substituting (a.2) only terms with p even occur,

i.e., c(t ) = 0. this should be compared with the exponential decay of the casimir

energy with temperature that is implied by (18), and is depicted in fig. 1. this

robustness of the classical (erroneous) solution, i.e., the nonexistence of corrections

to this nil result, is worthy of note. it implies that the correct, low t expression,

(18), obtainable from the correct quantum statistical mechanical approach, cant be

obtained by analytic means (i.e., power series) from the high t expansion side.

the case of p = 0 in the above expansion will be recognized as the sum over the

constrained number of modes, per unit volume, with the unconstrained number de-

ducted therefrom. that the result is nil constitutes a proof, based on a particular

regularization scheme, of the assertion (section 2) that the number of modes, per unit

volume, is unchanged upon varying the plates separation, d.

appendix b : consistency of the plasma dielectric function as a cuto

we used in section 3 the plasmon mode as a physical regulator (at zero and

at nite temperature) in our calculations, through the dielectric function (61) and

(64) associated with it. thus, in eect, we are thinking of the charge sources 
as electrons in a metallic conductor b. since the plasmon mode is a real physical
excitation in dielectrics, we expect it to be a consistent regulator. it is quite instructive

to show that this is indeed the case, especially in the nite temperature case. (for the

sake of clarity, we display in this appendix hs and kbs explicitly in the appropriate

places.)

as is well known,

(b.1)

where n is the electron density. in most metals, where n/1023cm3 = o(1), hp is of
the order of 10ev, corresponding to temperatures of the order of 105 ok, well above

the melting point of any metal. it is also of the same order of magnitude of a typical

fermi energy

the electron fermi gas is practically degenerate even well above the melting points

of all metals, and thus

kbt << f

(b.4)

in all our considerations. only electrons with energies close to the fermi energy of

the gas contribute to transport.13 the electron fermi gas and the gas of photons in
13recall that the behavior of the gas is governed by  = 3n  (120, 000ok/t )3/2 (n/1023cm3),
where  = q2h2/mekbt is the thermal wave length. for typical metals n/1023cm3 = o(1).

thus, for t << 120, 000ok, we have  >> 1, which means that the gas is in a high density and low
temperature state.

40

the cavity are in thermal equilibrium. thus, in the present context, and due to (b.3),

h1  2kbt << hp

(b.5)

as well. the frequency cuto normally allows many matsubara modes.

it is the

physics of the electron fermi gas in the metal that implies that kbt be much smaller

than hp. happily enough we need not worry about the fermi gas becoming appre-

ciably non-degenerate. thus, in particular, we may ignore any t dependence of n,

and therefore of p in our analysis. the metal will melt at temperatures much lower

than that. the classical limit is reached way below such temperatures.

appendix c : path integral calculation of the casimir eect due to a

massless scalar eld in the parallel plates geometry

in this appendix we evaluate the casimir energy due to a massless scalar eld in

the parallel plate geometry using the path integral formalism of section 3 (following

in part [5, 7, 8]) and analyze the classical limit. we also discuss briey deviations

from perfect conductor behavior.

as in the text, we take the plates to lie at the planes z = 0, d. thus, the surface

coordinates are u() = (x, y, ),

( = 1, 2). according to (79) and (76) the casimir

energy is given by14

(u/pd)eu/(eu  1) and of (u/pd)2eu/(eu  1), which do not introduce poles at u = 0, and due to
the extra factor of 1/(eu  1) in (c.9) are also well behaved for large u.

note that for any value of lpd, the denominator in the second line in (c.10) has a

all u > 0. thus, the force (c.10) is attractive. we displayed in the last line of (c.10)

the expansion of the casimir force in inverse powers of lpd. the leading term in

that expansion,

2
480d4 ,



(c.11)

is the casimir force in the perfect conductor limit, and it is precisely one half of

the electromagnetic casimir force (10). the next term, is the leading correction

due to deviations from perfect conductor behavior [29]16 [30, 46]. this correction

is manifestly positive and thus acts to reduce (c.11), which makes sense physically.
this expression, unlike (c.11), depends on the unknown parameter l, of o(1). having
this parameter in what is in principle a measurable quantity, is the price we have to
pay for treating the thickened boundary b, at large p, approximately as a skin
layer of width l/p in section 3 (see the discussion in the rst paragraph of section

3.1.2 and also the paragraph following (72)). as a consistency check, we compare the

leading correction, (2/60d4) (1/lpd), to an analysis of the same problem (for the

electromagnetic eld) in section 3 of [30]. the latter calculation is based on analysis of

electromagnetic greens functions, and does not make a skin layer approximation.

16there is a slight numerical error in the leading correction given by [29].

44

we see that this leading correction is of the same form of the leading correction in

eq. (3.22) of [30], and equals one half of that correction provided l = 3/2, which is
indeed of o(1).

obviously, we cannot use (c.10) to study grossly imperfect conductors, nor can we

use it to study the behavior of the casimir force at small plate separations d that fall

outside the range (63), since we derived (c.10) within the skin layer approximation.

in order to address these issues we will have to take the width of the plates and

the three dimensional plasma of electrons that live in them (as well as perhaps

additional dispersive eects [47]) into account, but we will not carry this analysis

here.

we now turn to nite temperature analysis and the classical limit. according to

(84) and (82) the casimir free energy is given by

we now consider the classical limit. at temperatures t such that 2d1 > 1, that

is, for t > tc/42, we see that (c.16) is dominated by its n = 0 term
