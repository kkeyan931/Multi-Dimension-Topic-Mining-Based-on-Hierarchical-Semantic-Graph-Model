the canonical quantization is performed at a light-front surface for the su(n) yang-mills theory.
the weyl gauge is imposed as a gauge condition. the suitable parameterization is chosen for the
transverse gauge eld components in order to have dirac brackets independent of interactions. the
generating functional is dened for the perturbation theory and it is shown to coincide with its
equal-time counterpart.

i. introduction

the light-front (lf) quantization (at a xed x+ surfaces) [1] of the gauge eld models is almost exclusively performed
for the light-cone (lc) gauge condition: aa
 = aa+ = 0 [2]. though this choice leads to a considerable simplications
of the interaction hamiltonians, then it leads directly to the cauchy principal value (cpv) prescription for the
spurious poles of the perturbative gauge eld propagators - which is known to be an inconsistent prescription for the
higher order computations [3]. the consistent regularization is the causal mandelstam-leibbrandt (ml) prescription
[4], which has been rst obtained as a mere computational trick and then derived within the canonical equal-time
(et) quantization for the yang-mills theories [5]. since then there were attempts to derive the ml prescription for the
lc gauge within the lf canonical quantization [6], [7], however they were successful only for the free abelian models
with two null surfaces used as the quantization surfaces. now it becomes clear that in order to have the ml-poles
for the gauge propagators in the interacting lf models one has to resort from the lc gauge and choose another null
+ = aa = 0. this gauge condition has been introduced for the lf
axial gauge - the lf weyl (lf weyl) condition: aa
quantum electrodynamics (qed) in [8] within the dlcq approach [9]. quite recently it was implemented for the
perturbative qed in [10] and [11], where the ml spurious poles have arised naturally for the gauge eld propagator.
the fermionic currents in the qed contain no derivatives of elds, thus the only complication which appears in
the lf quantization is connected with the presence of nondynamical components of the fermion eld  and 
.
this leads to the nonlocal (in x) terms in the hamiltonian, but ther consistent perturbation theory is equivalent
to the usual et formulation.1 for the nonabelian models things look worse, because the triple gauge-gauge-gauge
eld couplings contain derivatives of elds and for the lf weyl gauge there will be also a time derivative2 +aa
i
and the canonical procedure would lead to the dirac brackets which contain interactions. we notice that a similar
phenomenon also happens in the abelian model of qed for charged scalar elds. for a toy model in 1+1 dimensions
[13] the consistent lf quantization has been performed after a proper redenition of scalar elds which shifted all
interaction into nonlocal (in x) interactions but have left the lf dirac brackets free of interactions. we may hope
that a similar approach can be consistently applied also for the nonabelian model of su(n) yang-mills elds.
our present paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we perform the canonical quantization in three steps. first, we
recapitulate the analysis of the abelian model for the helicity representation of the transverse components ai. second,
we introduce the scalar representation for the nonabelian elds aa
i and choose a suitable form of the lf lagrangian.
third, the canonical lf quantization is performed with the canonical free form of the lf commutators. in section
3 we dene the generating functional for all green functions as the canonical phase-space path integral. within
the perturbative theory, this path-integral is shown to be equivalent to the canonical denition of the generating
functional, thus proving the consistency of the ml-prescription for the lf weyl gauge. in section 4 these results are
discussed and further developments are sketched.

1there are noncovariant contributions left, which are generated by the 1-dimensional (in x) determinants. though these
terms formally depend on a gauge eld, then their contributions can be neglected either on behalf of some proper regularization
chosen (the dimensional one [10] or the pauli-villars one for fermions) or due to their decoupling from normal modes of a
[11].

2for the lc gauge such time derivatives would be absent and this was the main reason for considering that gauge condition

in the early lf attempts [12], when the cpv prescription was considered as consistent.

ii. canonical quantization

in this paper we implement the lf weyl gauge condition aa

+ = 0 explicitly for the su(n) yang-mills theory, thus,

the canonical lagrangian, written in the lf notation, has the form

which further will be taken as the starting point for quantization. we stress here that one could also start with
(2.3) and then would reach the same nal results, however (2.4) produces least possible complications during the
quantization procedure. also we point out that our formulation is performed within the dimensional regularization
(d = 2), which at the stage of canonical quantization allows for the proper denition of independent modes, while
at the level of perturbative calculation it covariantly regularizes feynman integrals.

a. canonical quantization for the abelian case

before analysing the complete nonabelian model, we will present results for the abelian case, when all color indices
are omitted and we put g = 0 in (2.4). therefore our rst starting point is the equivalent lagrangian density for the
abelian case

consistency of the above canonical structure.
next the canonical quantization follows directly; from (2.8) we obtain the commutation relations

(2.10a)

(2.10b)

while the quantum hamiltonian is given exactly by (2.7). we see that source terms appear only linearly thus the
perturbative gauge eld propagators will be given just by the chronological products of respective (free) elds. however
we will not calculate these propagators here, instead we dene the path-integral representation for the green functions

(2.12)

the remaining integrations are utmost gaussian, thus one can perform them rather easily and derive the explicit
expression for the generating functional

4we have integrated by parts the transverse partial derivatives in order to have the most compact notation for the hamiltonian
density. therefore the sign  means that some boundary terms, completely superuous in the forthcoming analysis, are omitted.

b. redenition of transverse components of gauge elds

now we may start solve the main problem of this problem, namely, the lf quantization of the nonabelian gauge
eld system given by the lagrangian density (2.4). because the third and fourth terms in (2.4) look very similarly to
those for the charged scalar elds, therefore we will employ here the same trick [13], [14] which we have used in the
scalar qed. this means that we redene charged complex elds a and 

a as follows:

structure of interaction terms but this is not a fundamental diculty both in the canonical quantization procedure
and the later perturbation calculations. one easily can nd the canonical hamiltonian density

we notice, after [10], that within the dimensional regularization we can safely omit the functional determinants as
irrelevant constants. therefore our lf quantization leads to the same path-integral denition of generating functional
as the commonly used et formulation.

in the abelian case we have checked that the generating functional can be equivalently dened either as the path-
integral or canonically as the chronological product. below we will check the respectful equivalence for the yang-mills
case and we start with the canonical denition

iv. conclusions

in this paper we have shown how the nonabelian couplings can be consistently quantized within the lf approach
without spoiling the natural ml-prescription for the spurious poles. while we have used only formal arguments for
checking the equivalence of this approach with the usual et quantization, it will be interesting to check how it works
for the explicit calculations. we think that the computation of the gauge invariant quantities like the wilson loops
will be a quite interesting cross-check. further we expect that also other choices of gauge conditions can be similarly
implemented for the lf yang-mills theory5

5this would be a generalization of the fermionic qed analysis from [13].

appendix a: notations

in the space-time of 2 dimensions we introduce the light-front notation: 2 longitudinal coordinates x =
x0  x21
and 2(  1) transverse coordinates xi. similarly we denote components of any vector v: v =
2
v0  v21
, vi. further, the transverse components of the gauge eld potential aa
2
i , i = 1, . . . , 2(  1) are pa-
rameterized by the pair of hermitian elds (cid:0)a

a, a = 1, . . . ,   1(cid:1) as follows:

a, a

2a =

in the main text we tacitly use the convention of summing over repeating indices over all possible values of dierent
indices, thus in the above formulas we omit the sum signs hoping this will lead to no confusion or diculty.
