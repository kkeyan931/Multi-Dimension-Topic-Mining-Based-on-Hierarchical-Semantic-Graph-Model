the einstein-maxwell eld equations with cosmological constant.

banados et al. [1] in their elegant paper presented black hole solutions to the einsteinmaxwell eld equations
in (2+1)-anti de sitter spacetime, from now on i refer to them as btz solutions, opening with this work an area of
intensive research [24]. the btz solutions possess features inherent to the (3+1)-black holes, and it is believed that
(2+1)-gravity will provide new insights to a better understanding of the physically relevant (3+1)-gravity. neverthe-
less, the reported charged generalization of their non-diagonal metric (2), pag. 1850, occurs to be wrong, it does not
fulll the einsteinmaxwell equations.

one constructs a (2+1)-einstein theory coupled with maxwell electrodynamics starting from the action

varying this action with respect to gravitational eld one obtains the einstein equations

s =

while the variation with respect to the electromagnetic potential aa entering in fab = ab,a  aa,b, yields the electro-
magnetic eld equations

the non-diagonal btz (2+1)- metric has the form

a(cid:0)f ab(cid:1) = 0.

ds2 = n 2dt2 +

dr2
n 2 + r2(d + n dt)2,

(3)

(4)

where n 2 = n 2(r) and n  = n (r) are unknown functions of the variable r. the contravariant metric components
one can read from  2

s = gabab:

i restrict the electric eld, as in [1], to be frt = e(r) = at,r, thus
at

fab = e(r)(cid:0)t
b(cid:1) .

hence the non-vanishing contravariant f ab components are

f rt = e, f r = e n .

the invariant f then is given by 2f = e 2(r)  l(f ) = e 2/8.

the electromagnetic eld equations (3), in the considered case, reduce to d

where q is a constant interpretable as the charge, together with

d
dr

(r e) = 0  re(r) = q = constant,

d
dr

(r e n ) = 0.

dr (cid:0)gf rb(cid:1) = 0, and yield

(10)

substituting e(r) = q/r from(8) into the second electromagnetic equation (9), one arrives at

d
dr

n (r) = 0  n (r) = n 

0 = constant.

this means that the metric, instead of being non-diagonal is simply static (diagonal); the metric reduces to the
0 can

diagonal form by introducing a new killingian coordinate d = d + n 
be equated to zero.
a straightforward demonstration of the incorrectness of the banados et al charged solution can be established as
follows. if one substitutes into the maxwell equations above the functions presented in banados paper, pag. 1850
third paragraph after eq.(6), for the charged case, namely:

0 dt, thus without loss of generality n 

a0 = qln(

r
r0

), n  = 

j
2r2 ,

~e = (~a0)  e = 

d
dr

a0 =

q
r

,

(11)

(12)

where j is the angular momentum constant, one concludes that the equation for e,(8), is readily fullled, while
(9)yields the condition

qj
r3 = 0,

(13)

therefore in the charged case, q 6= 0, the angular momentum j has to vanish, j = 0 !!, and hence n  = 0. one is
then arriving at a globally diagonal metric a static charged metric for the whole spacetime.
although these approaches are sucient to demonstrate the incorrectness of the charged btz result, i shall prove

this fact also by using the einstein- maxwell equations:

the last equation above can be written as (r3n 

,r),r = 0 , thus it integrates as

n 

,r =

j
r3  n (r) = 

j
2r2 + n 
0 ,

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

the shifting freedom of the killingian  coordinate can be used to set the integration constant n 
replacing the derivative of n (r) into the rst order equation (15) for n 2(r), one has

0 equal to zero.

n 2

j 2

(18)

which integrates as

n 2(r) = m +

j 2

4r2  r2  2z re 2 dr.

let us now use the information contained in the maxwell equations:

d
dr

(r e) = 0  re(r) = q = constant,

which substituted into n 2(r) yields

n 2(r) = m +

j 2
4r2  r2  2q2ln r.

at this stage, with  = 1/l2, one recognize the structural functions presented for the charged case in [1]:

n 2 = n 2

q=0 +

qa0, n  = 

j

a0 = qln(

), e =

a0.

finally, substituting n (r) and e(r) into the maxwell equation for n (r),

one arrives at the condition

hence one has two possible cases:

d
dr

(r e n ) = 0,

qj
r3 = 0,

a) the electrovacuum plus lambda case with the charge dierent from zero, q 6= 0. in such a case j = 0 and thus
n (r) has to be a constant (reducible to zero), under this circumstances one obtains a correct static charged
(2+1)-solution with structural functions n 2(r) = m  r2  2q2ln r, and n (r) = 0. thus one arrives at the
main result of this comment: within the btz metric anzats (4) there is no charged non-diagonal solutions to
the einstein-maxwell plus lambda equations in (2+1)-dimensions.

b) the vacuum plus lambda case, with q = 0 and therefore e = 0. in this case the structural functions n 2(r) =

m + j 2/4r2  r2 and n (r) = j/2r2 give rise to the non-diagonal metric reported in the btz paper.

the equation (14) gives no further conditions.
to treat correctly the rotating charged plus lambda case, one has to enlarge the class of metrics, namely to deal

with a line element of the form

ds2 = f dt2 +

dr2
g

+ r2(d + w dt)2,

(26)

where f = f (r), g = g(r), r = r(r) and w = w (r) are unknown functions of the variable r. one can use the freedom
in the choice of the r variable to x one of the functions above. the electromagnetic tensor can be assumed to be of
the form

fab = e(r)(t
