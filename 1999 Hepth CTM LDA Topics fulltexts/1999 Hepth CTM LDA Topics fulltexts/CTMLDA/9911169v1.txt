abstract: general spinning brane bound states are constructed, along with their
near-horizon limits which are relevant as dual descriptions of non-commutative eld
theories. for the spinning d-brane world volume theories with a b-eld a gen-
eral analysis of the gauge coupling phase structure is given, exhibiting various novel
features, already at the level of zero angular momenta. we show that the ther-
modynamics is equivalent to the commutative case at large n and we discuss the
possibility and consequences of nite n. as an application of the general analysis,
the range of validity of the thermodynamics for the ncsym is discussed. in view of
the recently conjectured existence of a 7-dimensional ncsym, the thermodynamics
of the spinning d6-brane theory, for which a stable region can be found, is presented
in detail. corresponding results for the spinning m5-m2 brane bound state, including
the near-horizon limit and thermodynamics, are given as well.

1. introduction

non-commutative geometry appears naturally in certain limits of string theory with
a background nsns b-eld, as rst discovered in the context of m(atrix) theory [1].
recently, it has been shown [2] that non-commutative super yang-mills (ncsym)
theory directly appears from open string interactions, as suggested in earlier studies
[3] of the subject. more specically, ncsym appears [2] in a special low-energy limit

1

of the world-volume theory of n coinciding dp-branes in the presence of a nsns b-
eld. this fact has been used to extend the correspondence between near-horizon dp-
brane supergravity solutions and super yang-mills (sym) theories in p+1 dimensions
[4, 5, 6], to a correspondence between near-horizon dp-brane supergravity solutions
with a non-zero nsns b-eld and ncsym in p + 1 dimensions [7, 8, 9, 10]. see also
refs. [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] for further recent and related studies of non-commutative
geometry in string theory.

the purpose of this paper is two-fold:

(i) extend the analysis of the ncsym phase structure given in ref. [10], to a more
general path in the gauge theory phase space and use this to study the validity of
d-brane thermodynamics for the ncsym.
(ii) construct spinning d-brane bound state solutions and use their near-horizon
limit to analyze the thermodynamics of ncsym, extending our recent work [16].
modication of the gauge coupling phase structure of (i) due to the rotation will be
considered as well. since angular momenta and velocities on the supergravity side
correspond to r-charges and r-voltages on the ncsym side, the thermodynamics
of these spinning brane solutions with a b-eld may provide further insights into
ncsym.

we start in section 2 with constructing general spinning d-brane bound state
solutions, by applying a set of t-dualities to the general spinning dp-brane solutions
[17, 16]. the resulting backgrounds1 are bound states of spinning d(p 2k)-branes,
k = 0 . . . m, with 2m the rank of the nsns b-eld. for a given p, the solution is
spinning in the 9  p dimensional transverse space, and we show that, except for
additional charges and chemical potentials of the lower branes in the bound state,
the thermodynamics is equivalent to that of a spinning dp-brane.

in section 3 we construct the near-horizon limit of the general spinning d-brane
bound state, and discuss the conditions in order for the near-horizon solution to
describe the dual ncsym, focusing for simplicity on the non-rotating case rst. the
phase space of the ncsym at xed n is parametrized by the ym coupling constant
gym, the gauge theory energy scale r and the non-commutativity parameters bk,
k = 1 . . . m, which enter the position commutators [7, 10]

[y2k1, y2k]  bk ,

k = 1 . . . m

(1.1)

by considering a general type of path in phase space, we discuss certain general
features of the resulting phase diagrams in terms of the eective coupling ge. this
analysis depends on the dimension p of the dp-brane and on the rank 2m of the nsns
b-eld. we nd four types of phase diagrams, and analyze in detail which phase
diagram is relevant for the chosen path and region of phase space. for each value of

1for zero angular momentum these spinning bound state solutions reduce to the bound states

given in refs. [18, 19].

2

p and m > 0, we establish that a path and region of phase space can be chosen such
that the phase structure of any of the four phase diagrams can be realized. we also
determine under which conditions the description with nite n is valid. our analysis
includes the case considered in [10] and, as another case of special interest, the path
in phase space along which the intensive thermodynamic quantities are invariant,
which is used to examine the validity of the thermodynamics. we end section 3 by
discussing the eects of angular momenta on the gauge coupling phase structure.

ymqm

in section 4 we discuss the thermodynamics of the near-horizon solutions and
their corresponding dual ncsym theories. as was argued for the non-rotating case
[7, 10, 12, 13], it is seen that the thermodynamic quantities are the same as for
commutative sym case, with the coupling constant g2
ym of the latter replaced by
g2
k=1 bk in the ncsym case. then, using the results of section 3, the range of
validity of the thermodynamics is discussed, explaining specically the cases for which
a) the coupling can go all the way to innity and b) nite n is allowed. moreover,
we nd the region of thermodynamic phase space where both these properties can
hold. we conclude this section with a detailed analysis of the thermodynamics of
the spinning d6-brane theory, adding to the analysis of the near-horizon d6-brane
in ref.
[16]. this is of interest in view of the recent discovery that the d6-brane
theory decouples from gravity for m  1 [7, 10], and since there is a critical angular
momentum density above which the spinning d6-brane is stable in the canonical
ensemble [16].

for completeness, section 5 gives the corresponding results for the spinning
m5-m2 brane bound state, which can be obtained by lifting the spinning d4-d2
brane bound state to m-theory. the asymptotically-at solution is given with its
thermodynamics as well as the near-horizon solution, which is dual to the non-
commutative (2,0) theory. as expected the thermodynamics is again independent
of the non-commutativity parameter. finally, section 6 presents conclusions and
discussion. appendix a reviews the t-duality transformations used to obtain our
spinning bound state solutions and appendix b provides some details on the rr
gauge potentials of these solutions and their near-horizon limit.

2. spinning d-brane bound states

the spinning d-brane bound states that we will present are solutions of the low-
energy eective action of type ii string theory in the string frame

here h3 = db2 and fp+2 = dap+1 + . . . are the eld strengths of the nsns 2-form
and (p + 1)-form rr gauge potentials respectively, where the dots denote terms

involving b2. the integers p are even (odd) for type iia (iib) and iw z denotes
topological terms involving b2 and ap+1. using t-duality as a solution generating
technique (see appendix a) one nds from the general spinning d-branes [17, 16]
the corresponding spinning d-brane bound states with a non-zero b-eld. in the
notation of [16] these new solutions take the following form: the metric is

where ls is the string length, gs the string coupling and v (s8p) the volume of the unit
(8 p)-sphere. the second relation in (2.10) is a consequence of charge quantization
of the dp-brane, where n is the number of coincident dp-branes.

these solutions represent spinning bound states of those branes that carry charges
under the non-zero rr elds, i.e. of d(p2k), k = 0 . . . m. the background depends
on the non-extremality parameter r0, charge parameter , the angular momenta li,
i = 1 . . . n (n  [(9  p)/2]) and the angles k, k = 1 . . . m. for zero angular
momentum the bound state solutions of [18, 19] are recovered.

besides the charges and chemical potentials, the thermodynamic quantities of
the bound state solution are not aected by the non-zero b-eld in that they are
given by the corresponding expressions of the spinning dp-brane [16]

note that from the d3-d1 or d5-d3-d1 bound state, obtained for p = 3 or 5,
it is not dicult to obtain the corresponding background of d3-ns1 or ns5-d3-ns1
using type iib s-duality. the thermodynamic quantities will then remain unchanged.
for zero angular momentum these solutions can be found in [20] and [10].

3. the near-horizon limit

in this section we consider the near-horizon limit of the spinning d-brane bound
state solutions found in section 2. in section 3.1 we obtain the near-horizon solution
by taking the appropriate limit. in section 3.2 we review some properties of the dual
non-commutative eld theories corresponding to these near-horizon solutions, while
section 3.3 gives a detailed analysis of the gauge coupling phase structure. finally,
section 3.4 describes the eect of non-zero angular momenta in the dual eld theory,
and discusses the induced modications in the analysis of the gauge coupling phase
structure, presented in section 3.3 for zero angular momenta.

3.1 near-horizon solutions

we start by constructing the near-horizon limit of the spinning bound state (2.2)-
(2.4) in which the magnetic eld (2.4) is taken to innity in such a manner that a
nite rescaled value is obtained after taking the limit. as reviewed in section (3.2),
this corresponds to a non-commutative eld theory on the world-volume of the dp-
brane. for the non-rotating case, this limit was found in refs.
[2, 7, 8, 10]. this
limit crucially depends on the rank of the b-eld, denoted by 2m  p.

where the quantities on the left-hand side in (3.1), (3.2) are kept xed, and the
quantities on the right-hand side (labelled with subscript old except for k) are
those that enter the asymptotically-at solutions of section 2. the corresponding
rescalings of the rr gauge potentials are given in (b.11), which together with (3.1b),
(3.2b) leave the low-energy eective action (2.1) invariant. note that for m = 0 (i.e.
zero b-eld) the rescalings (3.1) correctly reduce to the rescalings of the spinning
dp-brane solutions described in [16].

taking the near-horizon limit, the following near-horizon spinning dp-brane so-

the functions k9p, wp and  are not aected by the rescaling and hence as
in section 2. note that a gauge transformation has been made that removes the
constant part in b. the corresponding expression for the rr gauge potentials of
the near-horizon solution can be obtained in principle with the data of appendix b.
for zero angular momenta the background reduces to the near-horizon solutions of
[7, 8, 10].

3.2 the dual eld theories

we continue by describing the mapping from the variables of the near-horizon su-
pergravity solution to those of the dual eld theory. this is done for zero angular
momenta (li = 0), but in section 3.4 the modications arising from non-zero li
will be discussed. we also comment on the validity of the thermodynamics of the
dual eld theories and review the conditions under which gravity decouples from the
world-volume theory on the brane in the near-horizon limit.

the zero slope limit ls  0 in the presence of a b-eld with rank 2m > 0, con-
sidered in section 3.1, gives at low energies a world-volume theory that is described
by the dp-brane born-infeld action with a non-zero b-eld. the latter is equivalent
[2] to a non-commutative supersymmetric yang-mills (ncsym) theory in p + 1 di-
mensions with 16 supercharges, where the non-commutativity of the coordinate pair
(y2k1, y2k) is given by [y2k1, y2k]  bk [2, 7, 10]. the ncsym theory on the brane
has a coupling constant gym given by

g2
ym = (2)p2gslp32m

s

= (2)p2gs ,

gs = gslp32m

s

(3.6)

where gs is the rescaled string coupling constant. from (2.10) and the rescalings
(3.1), (3.2) we nd in the near-horizon limit the new quantities

following [5, 10] we introduce the eective gauge coupling of the world-volume theory

g2
e = g2

ymn  m
yk=1

bk! rp3

(3.8)

where the rescaled radius r has the interpretation of the eective energy scale of
the eld theory, being the expectation value of the higgs eld [4, 5]. since the
curvature of the metric (3.3a) is of order 1/ge, the requirement that curvatures be
small imposes the restriction ge  1, so that one needs to be in the strong coupling
region for the supergravity description of the d-brane world-volume theory to hold.
the perturbative description of the world-volume theory on the d-brane is instead
valid at weak coupling ge  1.

k enter in the eective string coupling [10] has

the requirements ge  1 and (3.11) in principle determine for which values
of n, gym, r and bk, k = 1 . . . m, the dual eld theory is described by the d-brane
in the near-horizon limit. for the sequel, it is important to note that the d-brane
thermodynamics in the near-horizon limit gives the thermodynamics of the dual eld
theory precisely when we set r = r0 in the relevant expressions [5]. in the special
case of the d3 and d5-brane, we note that the condition ge
s  1 (with r = r0) is
no longer relevant for the thermodynamics, since their s-dual branes, being the d3
and ns5-brane, have the same thermodynamics3. as a consequence, for the d3 and
d5-brane case there is no bound on ge
s as far as the thermodynamics is concerned.
it is also important to note that for the dp-branes with p  5 gravity decouples
from the d-brane world-volume theory for all values of m, while for the d6-brane this
only happens when m  1 [7, 10]. in other words, for the d6-brane the presence of a
non-zero b-eld is crucial for the decoupling of gravity. only when gravity decouples
can we expect to have a well-dened eld theory that is described by supergravity
when the curvatures are small. as noted in [7, 10] the decoupling of gravity for
the d6-brane with m  1 implies the existence of a 7 dimensional non-commutative
eld theory. for this reason we will, after having discussed the thermodynamics and
phase structure in generality, give a more detailed account in section 4.3 of what we
can infer for this d6-brane theory.

3.3 gauge coupling phase structure

we now proceed to nd the gauge coupling phase structure of the d-brane world-
volume theories in a more general setting than previously done. in [5] the gauge cou-
pling phase structure was considered for the d-brane world-volume theories without

3this is explained for the spinning d5 and ns5-brane in ref. [16].

b-eld, that is, with m = 0. as we shall see, for m > 0 a much richer structure is
observed. the phase diagrams obtained in [10] for m > 0 for the d2, d4, d5 and
d6-brane will arise as a special case of the analysis we present here. in the following
we take 2  p  6 and 1  m  [ p+1
2 ]4. we also set the angular momenta to zero,
commenting in section 3.4 on the modications due to non-zero li.

for simplicity, we set bk = b, k = 1 . . . m, so that the phase space is parameterized
by n, gym, r and b. our aim is to study the phase structure in terms of the eective
gauge coupling

z  g2

e

(3.12)

going from zero to innity. however, there is actually a large freedom in the choice
of path in phase space that one may follow, which we parametrize by

ym  z ,
g2

r  z ,

b  z

(3.13)

keeping n xed. from (3.8) and the denition (3.12) it then follows that the scaling
exponents , ,  obey the constraint

it also follows from (3.5), (3.7)-(3.9) that as a function of z we can write

 + (p  3) + m = 1

where

znc(cid:19)
(ae)7p =(cid:18) z

 = 4 + 2  1

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

and znc is a constant determined by (3.15). since ae determines the (non)-commutativity
of the theory, we nd that for  > 0 the eld theory is non-commutative for z  znc
and commutative for z  znc, while in the case  < 0 the eld theory is commutative
for z  znc and non-commutative for z  znc.

using (3.15) the condition (3.11) can be rewritten as

ge
s  1  z  n

4

7p (cid:18)1 +(cid:16) z

znc(cid:17)(cid:19)

2m
7p

(3.17)

which will enable us to analyze the phase structure in terms of z. one of the common
features of this phase structure is that for z  1 we have a perturbative description
of the world-volume eld theory, while for z  1 the curvatures are small and the
supergravity description of the world-volume theory is valid. if there is a transition

point zt where ge
s = 1 then the supergravity dp-brane description is valid in the
range 1  z  zt and for z  zt we go to an s-dual brane description. in type
iib string theory this means the ns5-brane for the d5-brane, or the d3-brane itself
in the case of the d3-brane. for type iia string theory this means a supergravity
solution up-lifted to 11-dimensional supergravity 5. as described in [5] the world-
volume eld theories on the d-branes with m = 0 all have the phase structure with
one transition point zt  n
s = 1. the phase diagram corresponding to
this phase structure is depicted in figure 1.

so that the dp-brane description is valid for all z  1. the phase diagram
corresponding to this case is depicted in figure 2. if znc  1 it is possible to
have n nite.

from the above analysis we infer the following general conclusions:

(i) comparing the analysis to the phase structure of the m = 0 case [5] a much richer
structure is observed for m > 0: for m = 0 there was basically only one type of
phase structure, namely the one depicted in figure 1. instead, for m > 0 there are
four types of phase diagrams, depicted in figures 1-4.
(ii) for each of the ve cases, covering all values of , it is possible to nd a regime
with nite n. in fact, this regime corresponds to having the non-commutativity as
signicant as possible, i.e. having the largest possible part of the z = g2
e phase
space non-commutative. thus, it is possible to have a dual supergravity description
of ncsym at strong coupling for nite n. though it is not immediately obvious
how to interpret for nite n the scaling factor n 2 that appears in the extensive
thermodynamic quantities (see section 4.1) instead of the factor n 2  1 coming from
the su(n) group, we comment in section 6 on a resolution of this apparent puzzle.
(iii) the phase structure depicted in figure 2 is particularly interesting since only
one phase is present for z  1: the string coupling constant is small for all z  1
so that the d-brane description is valid in this entire range. as one can extract from
case 4 and 5 above, this phase structure occurs when   7p
7p . if in
addition znc  1 we can also have nite n.
(3.16). we are especially interested to nd the cases that allow   7p
gives rise to a very interesting phase structure.

we now consider some special choices of , ,  in (3.13), using eqs. (3.14) and
2m since this

2m and znc  n

4

a)  =  = 0: this case corresponds to the one described in ref. [10], where the

13

energy r is varied while keeping all other parameters xed. clearly, we cannot
have p = 3, and for the other branes we have  = 1
p3. this
means that   7p
2m is equivalent to p > 3 and p  3  2m. this is fullled for
p = 4, 5 for m  1 and p = 6 for m  2, as was found in [10].

p3 and  = 7p

b)  =  = 0: in this case only the ym coupling gym is varied. we have  = 1
and  = 1, so that for all cases the phase structure is the one depicted in
figure 1.

c)  =  = 0: in this case we vary only the nc parameter b. we have  = 1

m and

 = 2m

m so we have   7p

2m only for m = 1 and p = 5, 6.

d)  + m = (5  p): with this choice the quantity r5p/h7p is xed which is
necessary to keep the temperature t xed, as we shall see in section 4.2. it
follows that  = 1
2 and  = 1 + 2. choosing  = 0 (in order not to change
the position commutators of the non-commutative eld theory) we nd that
  7p
2m for p = 3, 4 with m = 2 and p = 5, 6 with m  1. the importance
of this case will be clear in section 4.2 where it will be considered in relation
with the thermodynamics.

we can also reverse the logic and ask whether it is possible for a given p and m
to nd ,  and  such that a specic value of  is obtained. this is trivially seen to
be true, in fact, since for a given  there are only two restrictions (3.14), (3.16) on the
three scaling exponents ,  and , leaving a freedom of choice in these exponents.
for example, with the additional constraint  = 0, we nd that  = 1  (p  3) 1+
4
and  = 1+
4 . it is interesting to apply this to the d2-brane, since in [10] no deviation
from the usual phase structure was found in this case. for p = 2 and m = 1 we have
 = 5+
4 with the choice  = 0. thus, also for the d2-brane, all four
types of phase structures are possible.

4 and  = 1+

3.4 non-zero angular momenta

in this section we extend the analysis of sections 3.2 and 3.3 to non-zero angular
momenta li, i = 1...n.

the isometry group so(9  p) of the transverse sphere of a dp-brane corre-
sponds to the r-symmetry group of the dual eld theory. from the point of view
of the thermodynamics, the cartan subgroup so(2)n of the so(d) manifests it-
self as the thermodynamic quantities {i} corresponding to the angular velocities
in supergravity and the r-voltages in the dual eld theory, and {ji} which are the
angular momenta in supergravity and the r-charges in the dual eld theory (see e.g.
[21, 22, 23, 24, 16]). the thermodynamics with non-zero li will be considered in
section 4.

14

the eective eld theory parameters ge and ae

k , k = 1 . . . m, are as before in
(3.8), (3.9) since r is still the higgs expectation value of the brane probe. however,

which depends on both li, i = 1...n, and the angles through the function wp in (2.6).
if we consider the phase space parameterized by n, gym, r, b and li, i = 1 . . . n we
can investigate, as done in section 3.3 for zero li, the phase structure when varying
z = g2
e. from the metric (3.3a) and the eective dilaton (3.18) the deformations
caused by the presence of non-zero angular momenta will depend on the ratios li/r,
i = 1 . . . n. if we parametrize, along with (3.13), the angular momenta as

then the deformations arising from the angular momenta do not change with z.

i = 1 . . . n

(3.19)

the analysis of section 3.3 used two special calibration points, z = 1 where the
curvature of the geometry is of order 1 and z = zt where ge
s  1. it might seem
that we cannot dene these points anymore, since for a specic gym, b and r we
have a specic z = g2
e, but both the curvature of the geometry and the eective
dilaton eld are clearly angular dependent. however, considering for deniteness the
zt point, we can dene this instead by stating that for z  zt we have ge
s  1 and
z  zt we have ge
is increasing near zt). in other words, we
only have to dene points on the phase diagrams for z up to a certain order, dened
by the large inequalities  and . therefore, for a given set of li/r we can choose
the scale of the variables n, gym, b, r and li, so that the phase transition points in
the phase diagram are dened with an accuracy good enough to have regions with
distinct phases. in this sense, the ratios li/r, i = 1 . . . n can be of any order, so long
as we choose the phase transition points to be of high enough order for them to be
well dened. hence, non-zero angular momenta do not induce any modications to
the gauge coupling phase structure found in section 3.3.

4. thermodynamics of ncsym from supergravity

4.1 the thermodynamic quantities

in section 2 it was shown that the thermodynamics of a spinning d-brane bound
state is essentially the same as that of the spinning dp-brane, with p being the spatial
dimension of the d-brane bound state. the only change is the appearance of extra
charges and chemical potentials, but the temperature t , entropy s, angular velocity
i and angular momentum ji were unchanged. we now consider the thermodynamics

15

of the near-horizon solution given in section 3.1, which can be obtained from (2.11)
using the rescalings (3.1), (3.2). we also note that the energy is computed from the

energy above extremality e = m  (p q2)1/2 in the near-horizon limit, where the

sum is over all charges in the bound state. here, it is used that at extremality the
bound state is a 1/2-bps state, and we recall that the expressions of the charges and
chemical potentials are given in appendix b.

one then nds that the charges as well as the chemical potentials are constant
in the near-horizon limit, and hence do not appear in the thermodynamics. for the
remaining thermodynamic quantities we nd in the near-horizon limit

boundary of stability at  = c. for more than one angular momentum the free
energy has the same prefactor as in (4.9) and the expansion in powers of  including
the rst two subleading terms can be found in [16]. for the case p = 5 the free energy
is zero since t and i are not independent variables anymore. for the corresponding
results in the d6-brane case we refer to section 4.3, which includes a more detailed
account of the thermodynamics as it shows some exotic behavior and will be relevant
for the 7-dimensional non-commutative eld theory that is dual to this supergravity
solution.

4.2 ranges of validity

in this section we discuss the range of validity in which the thermodynamics of the
near-horizon limit (see section 4.1) describes the thermodynamics of the ncsym

17

on the world-volume of the d-brane. in particular, we supplement the analysis of
the gauge coupling phase structure of section 3.3 with further details on the gauge
coupling phase space relevant for the special case in which the eective gauge coupling
can vary independently of the near-horizon intensive thermodynamic quantities (case
d of section 3.3). specically, we explain the cases for which i) the coupling can go all
the way to innity, and ii) nite n is allowed, and still have a valid thermodynamic
description.

the criterion that we impose for invariant thermodynamics is that intensive,
scale-independent quantities like the temperature t and the r-voltages i must re-
main xed, while the extensive quantities like the entropy s and the r-charges ji are
allowed to change when all the extensive quantities change uniformly. as discussed
in sections 3.3 and 3.4, for xed n the gauge theory phase space is characterized by
variables gym, r0, li, b, and the path in the gauge theory phase space is parameterized
by

where z = g2

rh here rather than r in ge since the validity of the d-brane thermodynamics is
considered. from the intensive quantities in (4.1) it then follows that we need to
keep r5p

0 1 xed, yielding the restriction

 + m = (5  p)

(4.12)

as shown in section 3.3, it follows from (3.14) and (4.12) that  = 1
the scaling of the extensive quantities is then proportional to z p3
of z.

2 and  = 1 + 2.
2 under the variation

we choose  = 0 in the following, which seems most natural considering that
the position commutators for the non-commutative coordinates are proportional to b
[7, 10]. with this choice,  = 1, so that the non-commutative sector is z  znc while
the commutative sector is z  znc. in the regime znc  1, n can be nite. as noted
in section 3.3, the condition   7p
2m is fullled for p = 4 with m = 2 and p = 5, 6
7p then the eective coupling z = g2
with m  1. in these cases, if also znc  n
e
can go all the way to innity with the d-brane thermodynamics being valid6 for the
dual eld theory, as depicted in the phase diagram of figure 2.

4

from the above considerations, we see that the most interesting part of param-
eter space is the region where znc  1, since here both n can be nite, and in
the indicated cases we also have that the d-brane thermodynamics is valid for the
dual eld theory for as large coupling as desired. it is interesting to note that the
requirement znc  1 can be seen as demanding the non-commutativity eects to be
6for the d3 and d5-brane this holds for all m, as explained in section 3.2.

18

as signicant as possible. we therefore nd this region expressed in terms of the
intensive thermodynamic parameters t and i. since  = 1

2 we have from (4.11),

r0 = r0z ,

rh = rhz ,

li = liz

(4.13)

with the parameters r0, rh and li invariant under variation of z. with this, the
invariant part of  is  = r3p

substitutions that,

rh  b1/2. it is not clear what the signicance of this special region of the (t,{i})
phase space is, but we note that this region is also of interest because the temperature
can be zero with the other thermodynamic quantities being non-zero.

4.3 thermodynamics of the d6-brane theory with b-eld

in this section we analyze the thermodynamics of the near-horizon spinning d6-
brane with a b-eld, reviewing and adding to the analysis of ref. [16]. this theory
is of interest since it has been shown [7, 10] that the d6-brane with non-zero b-
eld decouples from gravity in the near-horizon limit. this suggests the existence
of a consistent 7-dimensional ncsym, dual to the near-horizon d6-brane solution.
we can thus obtain information about the thermodynamics of this 7-dimensional
ncsym with r-voltage and r-charge by considering the spinning near-horizon d6-
brane. as we shall see, the d6-brane theory has various exotic features distinguishing
it from the other dp-brane theories.

substituting p = 6 in the general formulae (4.1) and (4.7) one obtains the ther-

modynamic quantities

where the horizon radius is determined by (2.13) as

rh =

4l2

0 !

(4.20)

this means that the angular momentum and horizon radius are restricted to the
ranges 0  l  r0/2 and r0/2  rh  r0 respectively. from this we see that l  rh
so that it follows from (4.19a) that t  0 and that t = 0 for l = r0/2 = rh.

we now address the question of thermodynamic stability of the d6-brane theory.
we begin by considering the grand canonical ensemble, in which the system is in
contact with a heat reservoir of temperature t and r-voltage . dening s = r0rh,
j = r0l and e = r0, which are rescaled versions of s, j and e in (4.19), we nd
the relation

s =

1

2(cid:16) e3/2 +p e3  4 j 2(cid:17)

(4.21)

from (4.21) one can check that the hessian of the entropy always has one negative
and one positive eigenvalue, and the theory is therefore thermodynamically unstable
in the entire (e, j) phase space.

20

another way to arrive at this result is by considering the gibbs free energy

(4.22)

(4.23)

f (t, ) = 84v6n 23t 2(cid:16)(2)22(cid:17)

where  = /t and  is the function dened by

for x  1. note that the gibbs free energy is positive, contrary to the gibbs free
energies in (4.9) for the other near-horizon dp-brane theories. the gibbs free energy
is a function on the (t, ) phase space, the properties of which depend on the map
between the supergravity variables (rh, l) and (t, ). for the d6-brane this map is
one-to-one, which is a consequence of the fact that the determinant of the hessian
of the gibbs free energy [16]

det hes(f ) = 62v 2

6 n 42r4

0(cid:18)1 +

l2
r2

h(cid:19)3

(4.24)

is neither zero nor singular. since this determinant is always negative, the theory is
clearly unstable for all points in the (t, ) phase space. we remark that because the
map between (rh, l) (or equivalently (s, j)) and (t, ) is one-to-one, the phase mix-
ing mechanism argued by cvetic and gubser in [24] for the d3-brane, is impossible
for the d6-brane theory.

turning instead to the canonical ensemble, in which case the system is in contact
with a heat bath of temperature t at a xed r-charge j, the heat capacity takes
the form [16]

from this expression it follows that cj is negative for 0  l2/r2
, zero at

h = 1. the d6-
brane theory thus has the remarkable property that it is thermodynamically stable
in the canonical ensemble, in the range
h  1 [16]. this can also be
written as  = /t  c with c  4.8551. in [16] the weakly-coupled d6-brane
theory was studied in the ideal gas approximation where it was found to exhibit a
qualitatively dierent behaviour, with the brane being stable when   c  4.9948.
the weak and strong coupling limits of this theory should therefore be connected via
a rather non-trivial phase transition.

if we consider the euclidean version of the d6-brane theory, we have to perform
the wick rotation  = it and l = il. this yields the restriction 0  l2/r2
h < 1 for
the euclidean theory, since r0 = (1 l2/r2

the corresponding expression for the entropy is obtained with the substitution
j 2   j 2 in (4.21), and it is easy to check that the hessian of the entropy always
has two negative eigenvalues. thus, the euclidean d6-brane theory is also thermo-
dynamically unstable in the (e, j) phase space, so there are no stable regions in the
grand canonical ensemble. if we consider the canonical ensemble, it is easily seen
that the heat capacity (4.25) is never positive, and hence there are no stable regions
in this ensemble either. the limit l2/r2
h  1 appears to be singular as, for example,
the temperature diverges in this limit. the issue of stability is not clear, since the
second derivatives of the entropy or the free energies go to zero or innity. it is thus
unclear, and highly questionable, whether a sensible theory can be recovered in this
limit.

5.1 spinning m5-m2 brane bound state

the spinning m5-m2 brane bound state can be obtained from the spinning d4-d2
brane bound state (p = 4, m = 1) of section 2 by lifting to m-theory, which gives
the metric

here, the functions f5, f5, k5 and l5 are as in (2.5) with p = 4, d is dened in (2.8)
and the one-form i is dened in (b.1). we also need the relations

(5.3)

where lp is the 11-dimensional planck length, h is dened in (2.9) (with p = 4)
and the second relation follows from charge quantization of the m5-brane. for zero
angular momentum the solution reduces to the one given in ref. [18].

22

aside from the presence of charges and chemical potentials for both the m5
and m2-brane, the thermodynamic quantities of this background are not altered
due to the presence of d, and coincide with those of the spinning m5-brane. for
example, it is not dicult to see that the temperature is not modied by the presence
of d and also cancels out in the horizon area (and hence the entropy); the same
conclusion holds for the mass, angular momentum and velocity. the complete set of
thermodynamic quantities is then given by

5.2 the near-horizon limit

next we turn to the near-horizon limit of the spinning m5-m2 brane bound state,
which corresponds [7, 2, 10] to the six-dimensional non-commutative (2,0) theory [25].

to compute the thermodynamic quantities in the near-horizon limit, one may
use the quantities (5.4) of the asymptotically-at solution along with the rescaling

which is a consequence of the rst law of thermodynamics (4.4).

eq. (5.11) describes the thermodynamics of the non-commutative (2,0) theory,
and is manifestly independent of c, i.e. coincides with that of commutative (2,0)
theory. just as for the dp-brane case, the only dierence of the presence of the non-
zero c3 potential is that the range of validity can be dierent now. in fact, focusing
on zero angular momentum rst, the curvature is [10]

r (cid:0)n 2/3(1 + a3r3)(cid:1)1

(5.13)

which needs to be small in order to trust the supergravity description. this can be
achieved either in the limit n  1 as in the commutative case, but now there is the
additional possibility of keeping n nite and requiring r  1/a. this shows that
the larger the non-commutative parameter a, the larger the energy range in which
the near-horizon limit is a valid description of the non-commutative (2,0) theory.
following a similar reasoning as in section 3.4 this conclusion holds also when the
angular momenta are non-zero.

finally, the general formulae of ref.

the
internal energy and gibbs free energy in terms of the extensive or intensive thermo-
dynamic quantities respectively. for example, for one non-zero angular momentum
the free energy takes the form

[16] may be used to compute e.g.

f (t, ) =

xc(cid:19)6

(5.14)

where x, xc are given by the p = 4 expressions in (4.9b), (4.10). for the resulting
boundaries of stability and critical exponents of the spinning m5-brane see refs.
[23, 24, 16].

6. conclusions and discussion

in this paper we have constructed general spinning brane bound state solutions of
string and m-theory, and discussed their thermodynamics, extending our work [16].
except for additional charges and chemical potentials of the lower branes in the
bound state, the thermodynamics is equivalent to that of the highest brane in the
bound state. we have computed the near-horizon limits of these supergravity solu-
tions, which are dual to ncsym theories for string theory and the non-commutative

25

(2,0) theory for m-theory. using this correspondence, we have presented a general
analysis of the gauge coupling phase structure of these ncsym theories by consid-
ering a general path in their phase space, both for zero as well as non-zero angular
momenta. this analysis, which includes the one in ref. [10] as a special case, exhibits
various interesting features, including regions in which the supergravity description
is valid for nite n and/or the eective coupling ranging from the transition point
ge  1 all the way to innity. more generally, four types of phase diagrams are
found, and we have established that for each spatial worldvolume dimension of the
brane and each non-zero rank of b-eld, a path and region of phase space can be
chosen such that the phase structure of any of the four phase diagrams can be real-
ized.

the thermodynamics of the near-horizon solutions is not altered by the presence
of the b-eld, in parallel with results for the non-rotating case [7, 10, 12, 13] showing
that, to leading order, the thermodynamics of sym is equivalent to that of ncsym.
this was argued at weak coupling from the eld theory point of view [11] by showing
that the planar limit of sym and ncsym coincide. as an application of the general
phase structure analysis, the validity of the thermodynamics for the ncsym has been
examined by requiring that the intensive thermodynamic parameters are invariant
for the path in phase space. we have determined the region of phase space in which
n can be nite and at the same time the coupling can be taken all the way to innity.
the resulting condition is that

7p

2

t  b1/2(cid:18) r0
rh(cid:19)

(6.1)

showing that that at xed non-extremality parameter r0 and horizon radius rh,
the larger the non-commutativity parameter b, the larger the temperature region in
which these properties are satised. interestingly, for  near 7p
low temperatures
2
are allowed as well.

having non-zero angular momenta does not qualitatively change the gauge cou-
pling phase structure, but may well provide further insights into ncsym in the
presence of voltages for the r-charges. moreover, as another application we have
discussed the d6-brane theory in further detail, adding to the results of [16]. this
theory is of interest in view of the recent discovery that the d6-brane theory with
b-eld decouples from gravity [7, 10]. moreover, while the non-rotating case is ther-
modynamically unstable, for the spinning d6-brane stability is found in the canonical
ensemble for suciently high angular momentum density8.

unlike in the commutative case, the non-commutative setup allows for situations
in which the supergravity description is valid for nite n. while in the usual large
n limit the 1/n corrections9 around the planar limit are generated by the string

8we note that the d6-brane theory is also related to m(atrix) theory on t 6 [26].
9see ref. [12] for a discussion of 1/n corrections to the entropy of ncsym.

loop expansion, for nite n this cannot be true anymore. indeed, it is not dicult
to see that in this case the eective string coupling (3.10) is small not because n
is large, but rather since the eective nc parameter ae is large, so that the string
loop expansion becomes an expansion in 1/ae. this indicates that, in some sense,
the framework enables one to interchange the large n expansion with a large ae
expansion. we also note that the  expansion of higher derivative terms in the
eective action, will generate 1/ corrections10, with  the nc t hooft coupling
(4.2).

the argument above provides a resolution for the puzzle that was raised in sec-
tion 3.3: while the supergravity description gives extensive thermodynamic quanti-
ties proportional to n 2, both for large as well as nite n, at weak coupling these
scale with n 2  1, coming from the su(n) group. in the commutative ads/cft
correspondence for n d3-branes it is believed [27] that string loop corrections scaling
as 1/n 2, will generate the correct n 21 factor, in accord with strong/weak coupling
duality of n=4 sym. thus, at nite n there is a dierence between sym and nc-
sym in the n-dependent factor at strong coupling. however, as argued above, for
nite n the 1/ae corrections should generate the desired correction to n 2 to obtain
n 2  1. finally, we note that the n 2 dependence at nite n suggest that there is a
non-perturbative degree of freedom in ncsym11 that is not present in sym.

a. t-duality as a solution generator

the spinning bound state solution (2.2)-(2.4) (and rr potentials given in appendix
b) can be obtained from the general spinning dp-brane solution of [16] by repeated
use of the following sequence of t-dualities and coordinate transformations [18, 19].
for each disjoint pair of spatial dimensions in the world-volume of the dp-brane the
relevant part of the background is

10for the d3-brane case, tree-level r4 corrections have been recently addressed in [13].
11in this connection, it is interesting to note that studies of instanton equations in ncsym [28, 2]

on r4 or t 4 and with gauge group u (1) have suggested an extra instanton mode.

for the rr elds the t-duality transformations are in the most general case
(with repeated application of the above prescription for disjoint pairs of spatial world-
volume coordinates) a bit more involved [29], but as an illustration we work out the
rst application on coordinates y1 and y2. we start with the rr-eld at12p and
t-duality in y2 gives

applying the rotation (a.3) one obtains

at13p = at13p2

at13p = cos at13p =  cos at13p2

at23p =  sin at13p = sin at13p2

b. rr gauge potentials

in this appendix we give the rr potentials of the asymptotically-at spinning bound
state solution (2.2)-(2.4), which can be obtained from the procedure outlined in
appendix a using in particular the t-duality transformations of the rr elds given
in ref.
[29]. to write these expressions we dene the following one-form, relevant
for spinning brane solutions

i =

xi=1

li2

i di(cid:17)

(b.1)

and we consider maximal rank m = [p/2], since lower rank can be obtained by setting
the appropriate k to zero.

the rr elds for the cases p = 2 . . . 6 are then given by the following expressions:

for the p = 2 (d2-d0) case we have

a1 =  sin 1(cid:16)h1  1(cid:17)i ,

a3 = cos 1d1(cid:16)h1  1(cid:17)i  dy1  dy2

(b.2)

29

and for p = 3 (d3-d1) analogously

a2 = sin 1(cid:16)h1  1(cid:17)i  dy3 ,

a4 =  cos 1d1(cid:16)h1  1(cid:17)i  dy1  dy2  dy3

(b.3)

the next case is p = 4 (d4-d2-d0) with rr-elds

a1 = sin 1 sin 2(cid:16)h1  1(cid:17)i

(b.4a)

a3 = (cid:16)h1  1(cid:17)i h cos 1d1 sin 2dy1  dy2 + sin 1 cos 2d2dy3  dy4i (b.4b)

a5 = cos 1d1 cos 2d2(cid:16)h1  1(cid:17)i  dy1      dy4

and analogously p = 5 (d5-d3-d1)

a2 =  sin 1 sin 2(cid:16)h1  1(cid:17)i  dy5

(b.4c)

(b.5a)

a4 =(cid:16)h1  1(cid:17)i h cos 1d1 sin 2dy1  dy2 + sin 1 cos 2d2dy3  dy4i  dy5

(b.5b)

a6 =  cos 1d1 cos 2d2(cid:16)h1  1(cid:17)i  dy1      dy5

a1 =  sin 1 sin 2 sin 3(cid:16)h1  1(cid:17)i

note that in the extremal and non-rotating case, the odd cases p = 3, 5 can be
obtained from the even cases p = 2, 4 by a t-duality in y3 and y5 respectively.

for the case p = 6, in which the b-eld can have the largest rank, we also list
the charges and chemical potentials associated to the d6, d4, d2 and d0-branes
