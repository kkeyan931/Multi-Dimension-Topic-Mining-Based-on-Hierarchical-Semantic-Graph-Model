solvable approximation small parameter one expand order approach real situation. case ym theory good approximation large energies terms free vector particles. carry quantum numbers taking values adjoint representation non-abelian gauge group small parameter question coupling constant g2 . however, problem description quantum eects cause coupling constant grow one approaches large distances small energies. furthermore, distance scale description terms fundamental ym variables becomes invalid due singularities perturbative theory . result, nobody knows pass low energies ym theory. thus question appears: approximation ym theory applicable regimes (high low energies)? promising approach problem consider su(n) ym theory n . limit ym perturbation series drastically simplies  graphs survive look like triangulations sphere. one hints  could string description ym theory limit, would two-dimensional theory representing triangulations. furthermore graphs contribute triangulations represent series expansion powers g2n (which taken nite n ) rather simply powers ym coupling constant g2 , time torus graphs topologies spheres one handle suppressed powers 1/n 2. thus 1/n 2 would small parameter expansion one could approach real situation. prefer description terms string theory? point string theory well developed powerful apparatus calculating amplitudes various processes  and, moreover, one could hope solve it. case ordinary ym one yet succeeded nding string descrip- tion, conformaly invariant supersymmetric ym (sym) theories recently considerable progress . worth mentioning string description conformal ym theories pure academic interest since due conformal invariance know dynamics theories distances, however one might hope string description would reveal features string theory ordinary ym. several non-anomalous self-consistent string theories satisfy su- persymmetry (susy) target space space string evolves. target space ten-dimensional, since otherwise well developed apparatus calculation superstring amplitudes . time, string world-sheets two-dimensional universes swept strings time evolution. innitely many ways excite world-sheet theory give dierent quantum states string. looks like particle living target space. among particles nite number massless ones, particles masses order string tension, usually taken big. hence, distances bigger string characteristic one (exactly strings look point-like ob- jects) massless particles survive, latter described eld theory target space rather string theory. among massless closed string excitations symmetric tensor particle, 3 which, due symmetry properties string theory, exactly number degrees freedom graviton. large scale theory (that contains lowest powers derivatives elds) could describe graviton einstein- hilbert gravity target space. rigorously shown  theory (interacting massless string excitations) follows string theory large distances. time case superstring theory one obtains sugra large distances. also possible obtain sym interacting sugra one includes open strings theory along closed ones. massless excitation open string theory vector particle proper number physical polarizations gauge boson. bearing mind, one could say string theory four-dimensional sym. situation consideration, superstring theory gives regularization sym theory. fact, superstring theory nite valid distances, large distances leads theory containing sym. unsatisfactory string characteristic scale get superstring description sym also deal quantum gravity dimensionality space-time ten rather four. fortunately new ways recently discovered add open string sectors closed ones. lead new ways coupling sym sugra. nd one add stack n d-branes closed string theory way respects susy. d-branes multi-dimensional sub-manifolds target space open strings terminate , closed strings still live bulk target space. hence, world-volume stack n d-branes low energies one sees u(n) sym theory , bulk standard sugra. thus, strings could describe sym theory attached four-dimensional world (d3-brane world-volume) uctuating bulk target space . specify string description one nd geometry strings uctuate, one must probe d3-brane outside: bulk. time, theory seen observer traveling d-brane could change uncontrollably, know full dynamics string theory. overcome diculty one force d-branes respect

charge source vary one approaches it. however, ym theory situation complicated. fact, charge theory varies respect distance known low energy scale. result, proper low energy description strong interactions still unknown. similar things could happen non-linear theory, gravity string theory. dierence presence susy bosonic fermionic degrees freedom exchanged theory . symmetry causes cancellation screening anti-screening due fermions bosons. latter happens 4 source respects part susy transformations, i.e. bogomolni- prassad-sommerfeld (bps) state . rigorous, hope reader least

d-branes give seeking string description ym theory contrast old string theory. first, case one could deal directly four-dimensional sym theory. second, one vary regularization energy scale ym theory living d-brane world-volume make much smaller string one . works follows: regularization suppressed information high frequency modes high energy theory underlying one question contain information. happens d-brane case high enough frequency modes elds living d-brane world-volume could escape bulk target space: could create closed strings living bulk . however, closed strings energies smaller brane curvature escape innity {$9611050$} instead stay throat region strongly curved part bulk vicinity d-brane, enough energy climb gravitational potential escape asymptotic region. conclusion, need
