abstract

we prove one of conjectures, raised by dorey and tateo in the connection among
the spectral determinant of anharmonic oscillator and vacuum eigenvalues of transfer

matrices in eld theory and statistical mechanics. the exact sequence of uq(bsl2)

plays a fundamental role in the proof.

recently, dorey and tateo have found a remarkable connection among the spectral
determinants of a 1d schrodinger operator associated with the anharmonic oscillator,
transfer matrices and q operators in cft for a certain value of virasoro parameter p[1].
this has been subsequently generalized to general values of p by appropriate modications
on the hamiltonian[2]. the most fundamental equalites among parity dependent spectral
determinants and q operators are proven by utilizing the quantum wronskian relation.
in this note, we provide an elementary proof of the conjectures in [1] concerning
the sum rule which is closed only among the spectral determinant (= product of parity
dependent spectral determinants). the short exact sequence in quantum ane lie algebra

we consider the schrodinger equation,

uq(csl2) plays a fundamental role.
bhk(x) =(cid:16)

here m is assumed to be an integer greater than 2.

d2

dx2 + x2m(cid:17)k(x) = ekk(x),

(1)

the spectral problem associated with this has been scrutinized in [8]-[12]. the prop-

erties can be encoded into the spectral determinant

dm (e) = det(e + bh) = dm (0)

and dm (0) = 1/ sin(/(2m + 2)).

yk=0(cid:16)1 +

e

ek(cid:17),

(2)

in the following, we adopt a notation dm (x) := dm (ex/(m +1)).
remarkably, it satised the exact functional relation [9], which reduces to a simple

polynomial form for m = 2

d2(x)d2(x + 2i)d2(x + 4i) = d2(x) + d2(x + 2i) + d2(x + 4i).

(3)

for m > 2, such a simple polynomial expression is not available and it reads explicitly,

(x + 2ik) =


2

,

mxk=0

(x) = arcsin

pdm (x)dm (x + 2i)

.

(4)

on the other hand, transfer matrices are introduced in the analysis of statistical
mechanics[3], integrable structures in c < 1 cft [4, 5] and so on [13]. we do not spec-
ify its precise denition. (we refer to [3, 7, 4] for interested readers .) for our purpose,
the following facts are sucient. let the deformation parameter q be ei2
. we denote a

uq(bsl2) module wj(), which corresponds to the j + 1 dimensional module of uq(sl2). the

associated (drinfeld) polynomial is given by

p () = (1  qj1)(1  qj3)    (1  qj+1).

(5)

see [6] for precise denitions. taking trace of monodromy operator over wj(), one can
dene the transfer matrix tj(). tj() constitutes a commutative family and satisfy t
system,

tj(q)tj(q1) = i + tj+1()tj1(),

j = 1, 2,   ,

(6)

and t0 = i. (note the sux j and the normalization of  are dened dierently from [4].)
as we are considering these operators on their common eigenvector space, we will use

the same symbol tj for its eigenvalue.

for 2 = 1

m +1, the above functional relations close nitely due to the following prop-

erty,

tm j() = tm +j(),

j = 1,   , m

(7)

and t2m +1() = 0.

again we adopt the additive variable x rather than multiplicative variable ,

tj(x) = tj(ex/(m +1)). then t system (6) reads

tj(x + i)tj(x  i) = 1 + tj+1(x)tj1(x).

we also remark periodicity,

( the variable  in [1] is related to x by  = x/2m.)

tj(x + (2m + 2)i) = tj(x).

(8)

(9)

in [14],[7], it has been shown that the substitution of yj(x) = tj1(x)tj+1(x) into
(8) yields the well-known y  system [15]. the solution to y  or t system is not
necessarily unique. one needs to know zeros or singularities of yj(x), or equivalently,tj (x)
in a physical strip (x  [1, 1]) to x a solution. with this knowledge, one reaches
the thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) equation, which yields a unique solution.
dorey and tateo showed, for m = 2, d2(x) and t2(x) satisfy the same functional
relation (3). the coincidence carries forward. with some additional tuning of parameters,
they share same analytic structure, which validates d2(x) = t2(x). for m > 2 they did
present numerical evidences to support a conjecture dm (x) = tm (x) instead of proving
that they satisfy the same functional relation (4).
in the following we will supply the proof. the idea is to utilize the short exact sequence

of uq(csl2) in [6]. (t system is one of the simplest consequences of it.) the short exact

sequence reads,

0

 wp(qp)  wp(qp)  w()  w()
 wp1(qp+1)  w+p+1(q(p+1))  0
for

= q+2p+2.




(10)

we abbreviate these modules to w0  w5, and the corresponding transfer matrix twi
(trace of monodromy operator over wi). then the consequence of (10) is,

0 = tw0tw1  tw2tw3 + tw4tw5.

(11)

in the additive variable, the equivalent generalized tsystem reads,
t(x)t(x + ( +   2p + 2)i)

= tp(x  ip)tp(x + i( +   p + 2))

+ tp1(x + i(  p + 1))t+p+1(x + i(  p + 1)).(12)
one substitutes  =  = p = j to recover (8). we refer to the above identity by
i(, , p, x).

we rst give the statement.

theorem 1 let (x) be (x) in (4) replacing dm (x) by tm (x),

then we have,

(x) = arcsin

1

ptm (x)tm (x + 2i)

.

(x + 2ik) =


2

.

mxk=0

we prove the above theorem in an equivalent form,

(13)

(14)

(15)

m odd,

m even,

cos((x) + (x + 2i) +    + (x + (2m  4)i)) =

sin((x + (2m  2)i) + (x + 2mi))

cos((x) + (x + 2i) +    + (x + (2m  2)i)) =

sin((x + 2mi)))



following [9]. to be precise, the condition (15) literally leaves multiples of 2 indeterminate
in rhs of (14). this can be however xed from the asymptotic value tm (|x|  ) =
1/ sin(/(2m + 2)), which can be derived from the algebraic relation (8) by sending
x  . we verify (15) coincides with (14).
to show (15), we prepare few lemmas,

lemma 1

sin((x) + (x + 2i)) =

cos((x) + (x + 2i)) =

4

t1(x + i(m + 3))

tm 2(x + 2i)

ptm (x)tm (x + 4i)
ptm (x)tm (x + 4i)

.

(16)

proof we rst note

cos((x)) = q1  sin2((x)) =s1 
= s tm 1(x + i)tm +1(x + i)

tm (x)tm (x + 2i)

1

tm (x)tm (x + 2i)

=

tm 1(x + i)

ptm (x)tm (x + 2i)

,

(17)

where (8) and (7) are used in the last two equalities. by expanding the lhs of the rst
equation in lemma 1, we have,

sin((x) + (x + 2i)) = sin((x)) cos((x + 2i)) + sin((x + 2i)) cos((x))

=

=

tm 1(x + 3i) + tm 1(x + i)

t1(x + i(m + 3))

tm (x + 2i)ptm (x)tm (x + 4i)
ptm (x)tm (x + 4i)

where we have applied i(m, 1, 1, x + 2i),

tm (x + 2i)t1(x + i(m + 3)) = tm 1(x + i) + tm +1(x + 3i)
= tm 1(x + i) + tm 1(x + 3i).

(18)

(19)

second relation is similarly proved.

we further generalize the expansion of trigonometric functions with even arguments

more than 2.

lemma 2 let  be an odd integer. we have the following relation.

(cid:18) cos((x) + (x + 2i) +    + (x + 2i))
sin((x) + (x + 2i) +    + (x + 2i)) (cid:19)
ptm (x)tm (x + i(2 + 2))
l(x) :=(cid:18) tm 2(x + 2i),

tm (x + 4ki) (cid:18)
(cid:19)

t1(x + i(m + 3))

l(x + (4k  4)i)

(1)/2yk=1

t1(x + i(m + 3)),

tm 2(x + 2i)

=

1

tm 2(x + 2i)

t1(x + i(m + 2 + 1) (cid:19)

(20)

where the order of the operator product should be understood as,

proof : this is easily shown by iterative applications of the recursion relation,

l(x)l(x + 4i)    l(x + (2  6)i).

sin((x) + (x + 2i) +    + (x + 2i)) (cid:19)
(cid:18) cos((x) + (x + 2i) +    + (x + 2i))
ptm (x)tm (x + 4i)

=

1

5

l(x)(cid:18) cos((x + 4i) + (x + 6i) +    + (x + 2i))

sin((x + 4i) + (x + 6i) +    + (x + 2i)) (cid:19) ,(21)

which follows from lemma (1). 

the above recursion procedure is regarded as the forward propagation. next let us
perform the back-propagation procedure: we apply matrices l on the column vector. we
observe a simple pattern there, which can be summarized as the following lemma.

lemma 3 we introduce a vector vt by

vt :=(cid:18) tm 22t(x  (6 + 2t)i)

t2t+1(x + (m  5  2t)i) (cid:19) .

then the following back-propagation relation holds,

l(x + i(2m  10  4t))vt = tm (x  (4t + 8)i)vt+1.

proof : the rst component of lhs in (23) reads

tm 2(x  (10 + 4t)i)tm 22t(x  (6 + 2t)i)
t1(x + i(m  9  4t))t2t+1(x  i(m + 2t + 7)),

(22)

(23)

(24)

where we have applied the periodicity (9) to the last component. by use of i(m  2, m 
2t 2, m  2t 3, x (4t + 10)i), one nds (24) equals to tm (x (4t + 8)i)tm 22(t+1)(x
i(2(t + 1) + 6)i), which is nothing but the rst component of rhs. similarly one applies
i(m, 2t+3, 2, x(4t+8)i) to the second component of rhs in (23), leading to the equality.

we shall x the relation between  and m as follows,

 =(m  2,

m  1,

if m = odd
if m = even

then our nal lemma is

lemma 4 under the above relation between  and m, one has

cos((x) +    (x + 2i)) =

t1(xi(m +3))

tm (x)tm (x+(2m 2)i)
tm (x)tm (x+2m i)

1

, m odd

m even.

,

proof : let us apply ls to the vector in (20). for m odd, the initial vector reads,

(cid:18) tm 2(x  6i)
t1(x + i(m  5)i) (cid:19)

which is nothing but vt=0 in (22). the product of matrices in (20) is

l(x)l(x + 4i)    l(x + (2m  14)i)l(x + (2m  10)i).

6

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

thus one can apply (23) recursively to nd

l(x)    l(x + (2m  10)i)v0 =

(m 3)/2yj=1

tm (x  (4 + 4j)i)(cid:18) t1(x  i(m + 3))

tm 2(x  2i) (cid:19) (29)

substituting (29) into (20), and after rearrangement using (9) one arrives at the odd case
of lemma 4 from the rst component. for m even, initial vector is v
t=0 = vt=0(x  x+2i).
similarly, the product of l is given by x  x + 2i in (28). the result of the application
reads

   l(x + (2m  12)i)l(x + (2m  8)i)v

0 =

(m 2)/2yj=1

tm (x  (2 + 4j)i)(cid:18) t0(x  (m + 2)i)

tm 1(x  i)
(30)

(cid:19)

again the substitution of (30) into (20) leads to lemma 4 for m even case. 
proof of theorem 1. : now the left hand side of (15) is explicitly written in terms of
tfunctions in lemma 4. it remains to check that it coincides with rhs. this can be
easily done by (1) or from the denition of (x) itself. 
as is noted previously, the common functional relation does not grantee the equality,
tm (x) = dm (x): one needs further knowledge on their analytic structures. in this respect,
we shall entirely depend on the argument in [1]. in the tba equation originated from
t system, one shall take the massless drive terms, marex/2m , (a = 1,   2m  1) and
setting mm r = 1/2( 1
2m )). then dm (x) and tm (x) shares same analytical
properties: both of them have same asymptotic value  and have zeros on x = (m +1).
the latter is consistent with a property of the schrodinger operator that eigenstates are
all bounded so ek < 0. thus one concludes the equality, dm (x) = tm (x)

summarizing, we have proven one of conjectures in [1] that tm (x) actually shares

2m )/(m( 3

2 + 1

same functional relation with dm (x). the proof utilizes the exact sequence of uq(bsl2).

this makes us expect further deep connections between the anharmonic oscillator and
quantum integrable structures.
