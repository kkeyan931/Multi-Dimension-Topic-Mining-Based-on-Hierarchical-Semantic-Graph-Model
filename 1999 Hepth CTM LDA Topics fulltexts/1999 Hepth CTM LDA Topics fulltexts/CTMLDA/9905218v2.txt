abstract

we present an sp(2n, r) duality invariant born-infeld u (1)2n gauge
theory with scalar elds. to implement this duality we had to intro-
duce complex gauge elds and as a result the rank of the duality
group is only half as large as that of the corresponding maxwell gauge
theory with the same number of gauge elds. the latter is self-dual
under sp(4n, r), the largest allowed duality group. a special case
appears for n = 1 when one can also write an sl(2, r) duality invari-
ant born-infeld theory with a real gauge eld. we also describe the
supersymmetric version of the above construction.

the general theory of duality invariance of abelian gauge theory devel-
oped in [1, 2] was inspired by the appearance of duality in extended su-
pergravity theories [3, 4]. for a theory with m abelian gauge elds and
appropriately chosen scalars the maximal duality group is sp(2m, r). the
only known example with an sp(2m, r) duality symmetry, where the la-
grangian is known in closed form is the maxwell theory with m gauge elds
and an m-dimensional symmetric matrix scalar eld.

without scalar elds the theory is self-dual only under the maximal com-
pact subgroup of the duality group. noncompact duality transformations
relate theories at dierent values of the coupling constants. the equations
of motion derived from the born-infeld lagrangian with a u(1) gauge group
are invariant under a u(1) duality group just like pure electromagnetism [5].
introduction of scalar elds [6, 7, 8, 9], as described by the general theory
developed in [1], results in an sl(2, r) duality invariant born-infeld the-
ory. however, the proof of duality is complicated by the appearance of the
square-root.

in this paper, inspired by the use of auxiliary elds in [10, 11], we present
an alternative form of the born-infeld action with scalars. the new form,
without a square-root, simplies the proof of duality invariance. further-
more, using this form we extend the born-infeld theory to include more than
one abelian gauge eld. however, these gauge elds must be complex. to
obtain an sp(2n, r) duality group, the gauge group must be u(1)2n. the
n = 1 case is special in that both real and complex gauge elds are allowed.
for a single real gauge eld, we give both the formulation in terms of the aux-
iliary elds and the square-root form obtained after eliminating the auxiliary
elds.

for the bosonic born-infeld with arbitrary n we have calculated the rst
few terms in the square-root expansion and based on these we conjecture the
general form of the action without auxiliary elds. it involves a symmetrized
trace. we also present an n = 1 supersymmetrization of the constructions
described above.

we now briey review the general theory of duality invariance of an
abelian gauge theory developed in [1]. however, we assume the gauge elds
are complex, i.e. we start with an even number of gauge elds and pair them
into complex elds. consider an arbitrary lagrangian

l = l(f a, f a, i, i
),

where i are some scalar elds, f a are n complex eld strengths, and f a
their complex conjugate . we dene the dual eld ga
 or rather its hodge
dual ga

2 ga  as

the main result of the paper [1], and extended here to the case of complex
gauge elds, was to nd the general conditions such that the equations of
motion derived from the lagrangian l are invariant under the innitesimal
transformations




g

i = i().

 ,

in (1) we have combined the eld strengths f and its dual g into a 2n-
dimensional column vector, and i are some unspecied transformations of
the scalar elds. the equations of motion are invariant if the matrices a, b,
c, and d are real and satisfy

(1)

(2)

(3)

at = d, bt = b, c t = c,

and additionally the lagrangian transforms as

l =

( f b ef + gc eg),

where all the space-time indices are contracted and a transposition with
respect to the gauge index a is used when necessary but is not explicitly
written.

the nite form of the transformation (1) is given by

and must be an sp(2n, r) transformation. this is the group of 2n-dimensional
matrices where the n-dimensional blocks a, b, c and d satisfy

ct a = at c, bt d = dt b, dt a  bt c = 1.

(5)

using

a  1 + a, b  b, c  c, d  1 + d,

in (5) and keeping only linear terms we obtain the innitesimal relations (2).
one can check using (1) that the condition on the variation of the la-

grangian (3) is equivalent to the invariance of the following combination

l 

f eg

f eg.

(6)

f eg + 1

4 f eg.

the linear combination (6) must therefore also be invariant under nite trans-
formations. in the known examples for real gauge elds one can write the
lagrangian as a sum of two pieces, the rst invariant under sp(2n, r) and
the second equal to 1
invariant piece and a piece equal to 1

4 f eg. similarly, for complex gauge elds there is an

now we are ready to describe the main result of this paper, a born-infeld
lagrangian with a u(1)2n gauge group, written in terms of the auxiliary
elds, which is sp(2n, r) self-dual

l = re(cid:20)tr (i(  s) 

s2 + i(  i))(cid:21) .

(7)

here the auxiliary elds  and  are arbitrary complex n-dimensional ma-
trices, s is a complex symmetric matrix with a positive denite imaginary
part, and  and  are hermitian matrices dened in terms of the complex
gauge eld strengths by

ab =

1
2

f a f b, ab =

1

2 ef a f b.

3

we can write the scalar elds as

s = s1 + is2,  = 1 + i2,  = 1 + i2,

where si, i and i are hermitian matrices. note that since s is symmetric
the sis are real symmetric. the lagrangian (7) is invariant under a parity
transformation, under which the elds transform as

 = ,
 =  ,
s =  s,
 = ,
 = .

the duality transformations of the scalar elds are given by

s = (as + b)(cs + d)1,
 = (a + b)(c + d)1,
 = (c + d)(cs + d)t .

(8)

(9)

for convenience we also give the following transformation properties derived
from (9)

s2 = (cs + d)t s2(c s + d)1,
2 = (c + d)t 2(c + d)1,
 = (c s + d)(c + d)t .

(10)

explicit use of the symmetry of s was used to obtain the rst relation.

note that one can require a matrix transforming by fractional transforma-
tion of the symplectic group to be symmetric. however the transformation
of  is inconsistent with requiring  to be symmetric. if we want consistent
equations of motions derived from the lagrangian (7) we cannot require a

4

symmetric  either. for n  2 this in turn is consistent with the transforma-
tions of the gauge eld strengths and their duals (4) only if we take complex
gauge elds.

4 f eg. the rst two terms in the

the noninvariant term can be written as 1
born-infeld lagrangian (7) are sp(2n, r) invariant. to show the invariance
it is convenient to use

re(cid:20)tr (

i

s2)(cid:21) = tr (

1
2

2s2)

to rewrite the second term, and then use the transformations (9) and (10) to
show the invariance of tr ( 1

2 2s2) and tr (i(  s)).

the equation of motion obtained by varying  is

1
2

 

s2 +   i = 0.

(11)

using this in (7) the coecient of  vanishes and the lagrangian simplies
to

l = re [tr (is)] = tr (s21 + s12).

(12)

for n = 1 we can solve explicitly the equation (11). it has two solutions

and we chose

 =

1 q1 + 2s2  s 2

2  2

s2

+ i,

such that the kinetic term in the action has the correct sign. using this
in (12) we nally obtain

l = 1 q1 + 2s2  s 2

2  2 + s1.

(13)

as mentioned before, for n = 1 we can also consider a single real gauge
eld. in this case we dene  = 1
born-infeld lagrangian without scalar elds

4 f ef . if lbi is the standard

4 f 2 and  = 1

lbi(f ) = 1 qdet( + f ),

5

we can also write (7) as

l = lbi(s

1/2
2 f ) +

s1
4

f ef .

as discussed in [9], this is the standard way of extending the self-duality
group from its compact form to the maximally split noncompact duality
group by introducing scalar elds.

(14)

(15)

(16)

for arbitrary n the equation (11) implies

2 = 

and using this in (11) we obtain an equation for 1

1 =

(1s21 + is21  i1s2 + s2)  .
this equation simplies using the following eld redenitions

c1 = s

the hatted variables satisfy equation (15) with s2 = 1. then x  1  c1

satises

and the lagrangian takes the form

x 2 = 1 + 2b  b 2 + i[b, x],
l = n  tr (x) + tr (s1).

we can solve the equation (17) as an expansion in powers of f 2

x = xm0

x m,

(17)

(18)

where m counts the number of times f 2 appears in x m. one can show
using (17) that x m satises the following recursion relation

l = n  trsq1 + 2b  b 2 + tr s1.

(20)

where x 0 = 1, a1 = 2b, a2 = 2b and am = 0 for m  3. we have

calculated up to the trx 6 term in the expansion for the trace of x using (18)
and the result coincides with the symmetrized trace of the square root of

1 + 2b  b 2
here trs denotes the symmetrized trace where symmetrization is with re-
spect to b and b. one has to rst expand the square root, then symmetrize

tr (x) = trsq1 + 2b  b 2.

each monomial in the expansion, and nally take the trace. we conjecture
that the relation (19) is true to all orders. then the born-infeld lagrangian
takes the form

(19)

the appearance of only even powers of  in the second term of (20) is due
to the discrete symmetry (8).

in general one also adds to (7) a nonlinear sigma model lagrangian for

the s eld. a metric invariant under the transformations (9) is given by

trh( s  s)1d s(s  s)1dsi ,

(21)

which is a generalization of the metric on the poincare upper half plane.

finally we briey discuss the supersymmetric born-infeld action. using

the superelds v a = 12(v a
1 + iv a
v a
2 are vector superelds, we dene

1  iv a

w a

 = 

1
4

d2dv a,

w a

 = 

1
4

d2d v a.

note that both w a and w a are chiral superelds. let us also dene

mab = w a w b.

we can construct the supersymmetric version of the lagrangian (7)

l = rez d2(cid:20)tr (i(  s) 

 d2(s2)  im)(cid:21) .

i
2

(22)

here s,  and  are chiral superelds with the same symmetry properties as
the corresponding bosonic elds. the bosonic elds s and  appearing in (7)
are the lowest component of the superelds denoted by the same letter. the
eld  in the action (7) is the highest component of the supereld .

just as in the bosonic case for n = 1 we can also consider a lagrangian
with a single real supereld. in this case one can integrate out the auxiliary
superelds and obtain a supersymmetric version of (14)

l = z d4

2 w 2 w 2
s 2

1  a + 1  2a + b 2

+ re(cid:20)z d2(

i
2

sw 2)(cid:21) ,

(23)

where

a =

1
4

(d2(s2w 2) + d2(s2 w 2)), b =

1
4

(d2(s2w 2)  d2(s2 w 2)).

for s = i this reduces to the supersymmetric born-infeld action described
in [12, 13, 14]. in the case of weak elds the rst term of (23) can be neglected
and the lagrangian is quadratic in the eld strengths. under these con-
ditions the combined requirements of supersymmetry and self-duality have
been used in [15] to constrain the form of the weak coupling limit of eective
supergravity lagrangians describing the low energy limit of string theory.
