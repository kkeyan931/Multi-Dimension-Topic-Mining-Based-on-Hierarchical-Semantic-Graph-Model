we study the properties of m and f theory compactications to three and four di-

mensions with background uxes. we provide a simple construction of supersymmetric

vacua, including some with orientifold descriptions. these vacua, which have warp factors,

typically have fewer moduli than conventional calabi-yau compactications. the mecha-

nism for anomaly cancellation in the orientifold models involves background rr and ns
uxes. we consider in detail an orientifold of k3  t 2 with background uxes. after a
combination of t and s-dualities, this type iib orientifold is mapped to a compactication

of the so(32) heterotic string on a non-kahler space with torsion.

1. introduction

the realization that certain string compactications can be described in multiple ways

has provided a signicant improvement in our understanding of non-perturbative string

dynamics. among the more interesting compactications are those with n=1 and n=2

supersymmetry in four dimensions. an intriguing class of such four dimensional vacua are
described by compactifying f theory on a calabi-yau four-fold m [1]. these vacua are
naturally related to compactications of type iia string theory and m theory to two and
three dimensions, respectively. the strong coupling limit of type iia compactied on m
is well described by the three dimensional theory obtained by compactifying m theory on
the same four-fold. if the four-fold admits an elliptic bration with base b, then we can
consider a particular degeneration of this m theory compactication in which the area of

the elliptic ber shrinks to zero. in this limit, m theory on the four-fold goes over to type
iib compactied on the base b with a varying coupling constant. the coupling constant
is  of the elliptic ber. this four-dimensional type iib vacuum is known as an f theory

compactication.

among the novel features of these vacua is the need to cancel a tadpole anomaly.

for this class of compactications, the anomaly is given by /24, where  is the euler

characteristic of the four-fold. if /24 is integral, then the anomaly can be cancelled by

placing a sucient number of spacetime lling branes on points of the compactication

manifold [2]. for type iia, the required branes are strings, while in m and f theory,

membranes and d3-branes are required, respectively.

however, there is at least one other way of cancelling the anomaly in type iia or m

theory, which is by introducing a background ux for the four-form eld strength g [3].

the g-ux contributes to the membrane tadpole in m theory through the chern-simons

interaction,

z c  g  g.

(1.1)

for cases where /24 is not integral, g-ux is actually required to obtain a consistent

vacuum. in general, the anomaly can be cancelled by a combination of background ux

and branes. with n background branes, the tadpole cancellation condition


24

=

1

82z g  g + n,

(1.2)

must be satised for type iia or m theory [4].

1

compactications with g-ux have a number of interesting features, but have received

little attention. the goal of this paper is to explore some of the properties of these vacua.

in the following section, we review the results of [3] where conditions on supersymmetric

vacua with g-ux were derived from eleven-dimensional supergravity. these conditions

are quite dicult to satisfy. as a consequence, the presence of g-ux typically freezes

some of the geometric moduli of the four-fold in a way that we describe.

some of these m theory vacua can be lifted to four-dimensional n=1 f theory vacua.

the corresponding f theory vacua have background uxes of two kinds. the rst kind in-
volves non-zero ns and rr three-form eld strengths, denoted h and h  respectively. the

three-form uxes contribute to the d3-brane tadpole through the type iib supergravity

interaction,

z d+  h  h ,

(1.3)

where d+ is the four-form gauge eld. in the second kind of background, some of the

seven-brane gauge elds have non-zero instanton number. in f theory, this possibility has

been discussed in [5]. these instantons contribute to the d3-brane tadpole through the

seven-brane world-volume coupling,

z d+  f  f,

(1.4)

where f is the eld strength for the seven-brane gauge-eld.

f theory is a useful description of these compactications only when the base b is
large compared to the string scale. however, for special choices of four-fold m, f theory
can be related to a type iib orientifold which is a complete perturbative string theory

[6]. in turn, some of these iib orientifolds can be related to type i compactications via

t -duality. largely for their simplicity, orientifolds of tori are most commonly studied. in

conventional models, tadpole cancellation is achieved by adding branes: either d9 and

d5-branes or d7 and d3-branes depending on the choice of orientifold action. in four

dimensions, the possibility of using the type iib interactions (1.3) and (1.4) to cancel the

d3-brane tadpole suggests that novel orientifolds should exist with backgrounds involving
h and h -uxes and gauge-eld instantons. the possible types of orientifold are then
classied by the choice of c-ux and g-ux in m theory on m.

in section three, we present examples of vacua with g-ux, including a simple orbifold

construction and an example where g-ux is required. in the nal section, we consider an
example of a type iib orientifold with constant background h and h -uxes. depending on

2

the choice of background ux, the model has either n=1 or n=2 spacetime supersymmetry.
the compactication space b is conformal to k3  t 2. this orientifold is related to f
theory on k3  k3, some aspects of which have been discussed in [7].

however, our interest is largely with a heterotic dual of this orientifold. by t-dualizing
along the t 2, we map the iib orientifold to a type i compactication on a new space b
with non-zero h -torsion. a further s-duality turns the type i vacuum into a perturbative
so(32) heterotic vacuum with non-zero h-ux. the non-kahler space b is no longer con-
formally calabi-yau. this is a concrete example, possibly the rst, of a four-dimensional

string compactication with torsion.

there are a number of promising directions to explore. for example, associated to

each of the type i/heterotic supergravity solutions is a world-sheet conformal eld theory.

finding ways of constructing and analyzing these conformal eld theories is a potentially

rewarding enterprise. there should be analogues in this more general class of compactica-

tions of phenomena associated with calabi-yau compactications, such as mirror symme-

try and its (0, 2) cousin [8,9]. there are also intriguing connections between these solutions

and the work of [10,11,12]. during the completion of this project, an interesting paper

appeared [13] with some overlap with section 2.

2. supersymmetry and g-ux

2.1. c-eld instantons

we begin by recalling the results of [3] for m theory compactied on an eight-
dimensional calabi-yau manifold m. let mpl denote the eleven-dimensional planck scale.
at leading order in a momentum expansion, the m theory eective action is given by
eleven-dimensional supergravity. a product metric on ir3  m is a solution to the super-
gravity equations of motion when the metric for the internal space m is ricci at. let us
parametrize ir3 by coordinates x where  = 0, 1, 2 and the internal space m by complex
coordinates ya where a = 1, . . . , 4.

at next order in the derivative expansion, there are terms with eight derivatives

which are therefore suppressed by six additional powers of mpl. among these terms is an

interaction of the form,

z c  x8(r),

3

(2.1)

where x8 is an eight-form constructed from curvature tensors. this term induces a tadpole
for the c-eld. a way to cancel the tadpole is to turn on a non-trivial g-ux. the metric

is then modied from a simple product and takes the form:

ds2 = e(y) dxdx + e

1

2 (y)gabdyady

b.

(2.2)

the metric g for m is kahler and ricci at. let us call the warped internal space cm.
the space cm is therefore conformal to a calabi-yau manifold.

there is also a non-vanishing four-form eld strength g on m which satises the

conditions:

gabcd = gabc d = 0,

gc dgabc d = 0.

the only other non-vanishing component of g is given in terms of the warp factor,

ga =  ae 3

2 .

lastly, the warp factor satises the equation:

3

2 ) = (42x8 

1
2

(e

g  g  42

8(y  yi)) .

nxi=1

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

the laplacian and the hodge star operator in (2.5) are dened with respect to g. we have

of g-ux and membranes must satisfy (1.2).

included the possibility of n membranes located at the points yi on cm. the combination
the rst condition in (2.3) tells us that g is a (2, 2) form on m. dirac quantization
requires that the cohomology class [g/] be an element of h (2,2)(m, zz). if /24  zz then
[g/2] is an integer cohomology class [14]. the second condition in (2.3) is the analogue

of the following condition for a two-form eld strength f :

gabfab = 0.

in the two-form case, (2.6) implies that f is anti-self-dual because,

(f )ab = acb df c d = (gabgc d  ga dgcb)f c d = fab.

in the four-form case, we can again express the epsilon tensor in the following way:

(2.6)

(2.7)

abcdpqrs = gapgbqgcrgds  permutations.

4

in much the same way as the two-form case (2.7), the conditions (2.3) imply that,

g = g,

(2.8)

where the hodge star acts on the internal eight manifold with metric g. this m theory

background therefore involves an abelian instanton of the c-eld. lastly, let us rephrase
the second condition (2.3) in terms of the kahler form of m,

in terms of j, the second condition states that the self-dual g-eld is primitive:

j  igabdza  dz

b.

j  g = 0.

(2.9)

(2.10)

this condition actually means that g is a singlet of the sl2-algebra generated by j, its
adjoint j  and their commutator [j, j ]. see, for example, [15].

2.2. compactications with extended supersymmetry

for compactications on ir3  m, we decompose a 32 component majorana-weyl

spinor under so(2, 1)  so(8) in the following way,

32 = (2, 8s)  (2, 8c).

(2.11)

for spaces m with holonomy su (4) and not a proper subgroup, we can further decompose
the so(8) representations under su (4):

8s = 6  1  1,
8c = 4  4.

(2.12)

the two singlets in 8s give the four real unbroken supersymmetries needed for a model

with n=2 supersymmetry.

if the holonomy of m is a proper subgroup of su (4), the theory may have extended
supersymmetry. see [16] for a discussion of the possible holonomies of an eight manifold.

we will discuss two examples which appear in later discussion. the rst is compacti-

cation on a hyperkahler manifold with holonomy sp(2). on decomposing the 8s and 8c

representations, we nd

8s = 5  1  1  1,
8c = 4  4.
5

(2.13)

therefore, this compactication can have n=3 supersymmetry. since the space is hy-
perkahler, there is a ip1 of choices of complex structure. to see this, note that we can
construct a complex structure tensor j i

j from any complex covariantly constant spinor 

in the usual way:

j i

j = ii

j.

(2.14)

the indices i, j = 1, . . . , 8 and i are gamma matrices for m. for each of the ip1 of choices
for , where  has norm one, there is a corresponding complex structure tensor.

the second example has holonomy sp(1)  sp(1). in this case,
8s = (2, 2)  (1, 1)  (1, 1)  (1, 1)  (1, 1),
8c = (2, 1)  (2, 1)  (1, 2)  (1, 2).

(2.15)

this compactication has at most n=4 supersymmetry. there is a ip1  ip1 of complex
structures. whether there is extended supersymmetry actually depends on the choice of

g-ux. to preserve more than n=2 supersymmetry, the g-ux must be a primitive (2, 2)

class with respect to more than a single complex structure. in section three, we will meet

examples of g-ux which do not preserve all the supersymmetries of the compactication

manifold.

2.3. kaluza-klein reduction with a warp factor

in the presence of background uxes and a warp factor, the counting of light degrees of

freedom is typically quite dicult because the equations obeyed by the metric and c-eld

uctuations are coupled. the metric takes the form,

(cid:18) e

0

0

bg(cid:19) ,

(2.16)

1

2 g. let us begin by considering purely metric deformations. since the metric

wherebg = e

g is calabi-yau, innitesimal deformations of g are classied in the usual way by elements
of h 3,1(m) and h 1,1(m). however, those complex structure deformations that do not
keep g a (2, 2) class become massive. likewise, deformations of the kahler structure that

do not keep g primitive become massive. in this way, we generically lose a large number

of geometric moduli.

let us take the generic case where n=2 spacetime supersymmetry is preserved. the

moduli that we wish to count appear in two kinds of multiplet: the rst is the dimensional

6

reduction of a four-dimensional n=1 chiral multiplet. the second is the reduction of an
n=1 vector multiplet. in three dimensions, the vector multiplet can be dualized to a chiral
multiplet containing a dual scalar. each surviving deformation in h 3,1(m) gives rise to
a chiral multiplet, while each deformation in h 1,1(m) gives rise to the scalar eld of a
vector multiplet. the vector eld itself comes from a c-eld zero-mode.

let us consider the eect of just a warp factor on the c-eld equations. without

g-ux, the c-eld obeys the free-eld equation,

d  dc = 0.

by using the gauge invariance cc + d, we can demand that c satisfy

combined with the eld equation, this gives the usual condition,

d  c = 0.

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

decomposing (2.19) into spacetime and internal components gives,

(cid:26)  + ebg 

bc = 0.
e bgab(a)b(cid:27) c = 0.

3
2

the last two terms in (2.20) will look like mass terms from the perspective of the three-

dimensional observer. the second term is conventional and leads to the usual harmonicity
condition on the internal components of c. however, the third term is a new consequence

of the warp factor.

in the presence of non-trivial background g-ux, equation (2.17) for a uctuation c

becomes:

we have set all metric uctuations to zero in (2.21). we decompose c into a product of

d  d c = g  d c.

(2.21)

spacetime and internal elds,

c = (x)c(3)(y) + a(x)c(2)(y),

(2.22)

where we only consider spacetime multiplets with vector or scalar elds, and c(n) is an
n-form on the eight manifold. we can dispense immediately with the counting of vector
elds a(x) since each zero-mode of c(2) pairs with a kahler class deformation to give a
vector multiplet. we only need to count the number of massless modes from h 1,1(m) to
count the number of vector multiplets.

the nal source of moduli are the analogues of wilson lines for the c-eld. in the
absence of g-ux, any element of h 2,1(m) gives rise to a zero-mode for c(3) and therefore
a chiral multiplet.1 in the presence of g-ux, the conditions on c(3) are modied. we can

1 note that h 3,0(m) is empty for a simply connected calabi-yau.

7

expand the left hand side of (2.21) as follows,

d  d c = d  d  c(3) + d  d  c(3) +   d(e3/2  dc(3)),

(2.23)

where each hodge star appearing on the right hand side is with respect to the unwarped

spacetime and internal metrics.

combining (2.23) with the right hand side of (2.21) gives the following set of equations:

 g  dc(3) = 0,
d  g  c(3) = 0,
 d  d  c(3) = 0,
d  d  c(3) =   d(cid:16)e3/2{dc(3)  dc(3)}(cid:17) .

to satisfy the third equation in (2.24), we can x the gauge by demanding that,

d  c = 0.

(2.24)

(2.25)

this choice diers from the usual gauge xing condition (2.18) by an exact form. as
a consequence of (2.25), d  c(3) = 0. the rst equation in (2.24) is a consequence of
equation two which requires that,

g  c(3) = 0.

(2.26)

this condition is the analogue of the primitivity condition (2.10) for the metric.

the right hand side of the nal equation in (2.24) must vanish since this term gives
a mass to the spacetime eld . requiring that the perturbation dc(3) take us to a
supersymmetric vacuum implies that dc(3) must be self-dual, which in turn implies that
c(3) is harmonic. therefore any element of h 2,1(m) which satises (2.26) gives rise to a
chiral multiplet.

2.4. lifting g-ux to f theory

if the eight manifold m is elliptically-bered with base b, then by shrinking the
volume of the ber, we can lift our m theory compactication to a four-dimensional type
iib compactication on ir4  b. since the power of the warp factor is dierent for the
spacetime and internal metric in (2.16), we might worry that the resulting four-dimensional

metric breaks lorentz invariance.

8

let us rst show that this is not the case. m theory on t 2 with area a maps to type
iib on a circle s1 with radius proportional to 1/a. locally, the warp factor rescales the

metric sending:

however, this corresponds to rescaling the iib circle metric by

a  e/2a.

1

a2  e 1
a2 ,

which is precisely the power needed to obtain a lorentz invariant four-dimensional metric.

how does the g-ux lift to type iib? let us start with the ga component. this

component has the form dc, and the this c-eld lifts to a component of the four-form
d+ of type iib:

c  d+

.

(2.27)

note that  is a spacetime index and that dd+ is not required to be self-dual. what is

required to be self-dual is the combination,

f + = dd+ 

1
2

b  h +

1
2

b  h .

(2.28)

therefore the presence of this spacetime d+ eld does not imply that there is a d+ eld

in the internal space.

we can divide the remaining g-ux involving gabc d into two cases. there could be a
component of g with no legs along the ber. this component would map in the following

way,

gabc d  (dd)+

abc d.

this ux breaks four-dimensional lorentz invariance. by self-duality of g, this case also

rules out the possibility of components with two legs along the ber.

the remaining possibility is the case where g is locally the product of a three-form on
b and a one-form in the ber. in this case, we can also dierentiate between two kinds of
g-ux. we can see this already in the relation between m theory on k3 = t 4/zz2 and the
type iib orientifold of t 2 by (1)fl zz2, where  is world-sheet parity [17]. m theory on
t 4/zz2 has 22 gauge-elds obtained by reducing the c-eld on the 22 forms in h 2(k3, zz).
the 22 forms on t 4/zz2 are grouped in the following way: there are 16 twisted sector
(1, 1) forms. each twisted sector form comes from an a1 singularity so the gauge group is

9

enhanced to su (2). the (2, 0) and (0, 2) forms descend from t 4 as do 4 more untwisted
(1, 1) forms. the gauge group is su (2)16  u (1)6.

in the limit where a0, the two untwisted sector forms corresponding to the class of
the ber and its hodge dual are no longer normalizable. we can identify the remaining

20 forms with gauge-elds in the orientifold theory in the following manner: note that the
action (1)fl is an element of sl(2, zz) given by the matrix,

0 1(cid:19) ,
(cid:18)1

0

(2.29)

which projects out both b and b. the only components which survive the projection
have a leg along t 2. the 4 kaluza-klein gauge-elds obtained by reducing b and b along
one-cycles of t 2 are then identied with the 4 surviving untwisted sector forms of t 4/zz2.
the 16 xed points coalesce into 4 groups of coincident a1 singularities. the gauge group
is enhanced from su (2)4so(8). the so(8) arises in the orientifold picture from placing
4 d7-branes at the location of each o7-plane.

therefore, if our g-ux is localized around a singular ber of the elliptic bration, it

will lift to the eld strength of a seven-brane gauge-eld. the gauge-eld will have non-

zero instanton number on the 4-cycle wrapped by the seven-brane. if there are multiple
seven-branes then the gauge-group can be non-abelian as in the t 4/zz2 example. in this
situation, the supergravity analysis is incomplete since the enhanced gauge symmetry is

non-perturbative in m theory. from f theory, we certainly expect the gauge-eld to sat-

isfy the non-abelian donaldson-uhlenbeck-yau equation. any holomorphic stable vector

bundle would then give a supersymmetric solution.

for the most part, we will consider the last choice for g. in this case, we can express

g locally in terms of a basis for one-forms on the torus,

dz = dx +  dy

dz = dx +  dy,

in the following way,

g
2

= dz    dz  ,

(2.30)

where   h 1,2(b). the ux then lifts to a combination of the ns eld strength h and
rr eld strength h . the eld strengths are given in terms of ,

h =   
h  =    .

10

(2.31)

the anomaly cancellation condition then becomes,

where n is the number of d3-branes.


24

= n z h  h ,

(2.32)

the ns eld strength h and the rr eld strength h  are naturally arranged in an

sl(2, zz) doublet of type iib supergravity:2

in terms of ,

 =

 =

1
2
1
2

(h    h)
(h    h) .

  2 ()

  2 .

(2.33)

in a generic f theory compactication, the iib elds undergo non-trivial monodromies by

elements of sl(2, zz) around singular bers. under an sl(2, zz) transformation


 and  transform in the following way,

a + b
c + d

,

 (cid:18) c + d

c + d(cid:19)1/2

  (cid:18) c + d

c + d(cid:19)1/2

.

(2.34)

our h and h  eld strengths can therefore be rotated non-trivially by sl(2, zz) as we
move along the base space b.

3. constructing vacua with g-flux

3.1. k3  k3

the rst example that we will consider is m theory on k31 k32. this compactica-
tion space gives n=4 supersymmetry in three dimensions. the anomaly /24 = 24 which

must be cancelled by a combination of branes and g-ux. we therefore require that,

1

2z g

2 

g
2  24.

2 unfortunately, the natural complex combinations of h and h  are usually denoted g and
g in the literature. to avoid confusion, we have chosen the notation  and . see [18] for an
explanation of the mapping between the su (1, 1)/u (1) and the sl(2, ir)/u (1) parametrizations

of the supergravity moduli space.

11

let j1 and j2 denote the kahler forms for k31 and k32, respectively. we will initially
choose g-ux of the form,

g
2

= 1  2,

(3.1)

where i  h 1,1(k3i, zz). each i must also be primitive with respect to ji. by denition,
each i is an element of the picard group p ic(k3i).

for a generic k3, the picard group will be empty. to nd a solution, let us construct
a k3 surface in the following way: take a hypersurface in ip1  ip1  ip1 of degree (2, 2, 2).
there are three natural elements of p ic(k3) which we will denote c1, c2, c3. these classes

are determined by the three hyperplanes,

{p}  ip1  ip1,
ip1  {p}  ip1,
ip1  ip1  {p},

(3.2)

for {p} a point. with a standard abuse of notation, we will use ci to denote both the
cohomology class and the cycle dual to the poincare dual of ci. the intersection matrix
for the ci is easily computed. any two distinct ci intersect on a ip1. a quadratic in
ip1 gives two points. the self-intersection number of any ci vanishes, so we obtain the
following intersection matrix:

we can take j = c1 + c2 + c3 as the kahler form for this surface. as our basic primitive
class, let us take  = c1  c2. the self-intersection number of  is 4.

we can take both k31 and k32 to be surfaces of the kind described above. each space
is endowed with a primitive form denoted 1 and 2. to cancel the anomaly completely,
we can place 16 membranes on k31  k32 and turn on,

g
2

= 1  2.

(3.4)

we can also cancel the anomaly completely without branes in the following way: in addition
to , let us consider the primitive class  = c1  c3 with self-intersection 4. then
   = 2 and we can turn on the ux,

g
2

= (1 + 1)  2.

12

(3.5)

0 2 2
2 0 2
2 2 0



 .

(3.3)

note that this choice of g-ux is a primitive (2, 2) class with respect to each of the ip1ip1
choices of complex structure. the full n=4 supersymmetry is therefore preserved.

as a second more exotic example, let us consider the k3 surface obtained by quoti-

enting a square t 4 with coordinates (z1, z2) by,

g1 : (z1, z2)(iz1, iz2).

(3.6)

under this zz4 quotient action, there are no untwisted (1, 1) forms. the resulting k3 has
picard number 20 [19]. linear combinations of the twenty twisted sector (1, 1) forms are

therefore integral classes. this implies that combinations of (2, 0) and (0, 2) forms are
also integral classes because h 2(k3, zz) has 22 elements. the intersection matrix for these

transcendental integral classes is given by [19]

(cid:18) 2

0

0

2(cid:19) .

for this orbifold case, we note that the untwisted sector holomorphic (2, 0) form

 = dz1dz2

(3.7)

satises r    = 4. let us take both k31 and k32 to be t 4/zz4 orbifolds. then the

(2, 2) form

{1  2 + 1  2} ,

(3.8)

dened on k31  k32 is primitive and integral.

we also require a class , which we take to be a primitive (1, 1) class with self-
intersection 4. for example, the class obtained by taking the dierence of the cycles
coming from the resolution of the

(z1 = 1/2, z2 = 1/2),

(z1 = i/2, z2 = i/2)

xed points in the (g1)2 twisted sector. this class has zero intersection with every other
(1, 1) form. there are a number of other choices for . we can then cancel the anomaly

completely with the following g-ux:

g
2

= 1  2 + 1  2 + 1  2.

(3.9)

note that this choice of g-ux does not preserve the full n=4 supersymmetry. varying

the complex structure of k3i rotates i, i and ji into each other. the resulting g is no

13

longer supersymmetric. therefore, only n=2 supersymmetry survives. we will contruct
another example of a k3  k3 compactication with g-ux in the following section.

before leaving this case, let us see how special choices of g-ux appear in the e8  e8
heterotic dual. for illustration, let us take the form (3.1) for our g-ux. m theory on
k31  k32 has a dual realization in terms of the heterotic string on t 3  k32. away
from points of enhanced symmetry, the heterotic string on t 3 has 22 abelian gauge-elds.

as mentioned before, the gauge-elds arise in m theory by reducing the c-eld on the
22 elements of h 2(k3, zz). we can then express g reduced on k31 in terms of the eld
strength f for an abelian gauge-eld,

g
2

= f  1.

we then take f = 2, which corresponds on the heterotic side to taking an abelian
connection with some instanton number on k32. any membranes used to cancel the
anomaly correspond to heterotic ve-branes wrapping t 3. for the 16 gauge-elds coming
from the cartan of e8  e8, supersymmetry requires that,

gabfab = 0,

and that f be a (1, 1) form. clearly these constraints are satised by any g-ux of the

form (3.1).

3.2. some orbifold examples with constant g-ux

the next class of examples that we will construct have orbifold singularities. these

examples all have constant g-uxes.
in cases with f theory lifts, the corresponding h
and h -uxes will be also be constant. let (z1, z2, z3, z4) coordinatize t 8. since we will
consider only zz2 quotients, we restrict t 8 to t 2  t 2  t 2  t 2 with each t 2 rectangular.
we choose each t 2 to have periods,

zj

x

dzi = i
j

zj

y

dzi = i i
j,

where i

x and i

y are the x and y one-cycles.

since our spaces will be zz2 quotients of t 8, the metric is at away from the singular-

ities and the kahler form is,

j =xi

dzi  dzi.

14

(3.10)

let us take g to have the form,

g
2

=a dz1dz2dz3dz4 + a dz1dz2dz3dz4 + b dz1dz2dz3dz4+

b dz1dz2dz3dz4 + c dz1dz2dz3dz4 + c  dz1dz2dz3dz4.

(3.11)

this choice of (2, 2) form certainly satises j  g = 0. by construction, g is real. we also
require that g/2 be (half)-integer quantized. requiring that g/2 be integral over all
four-cycles of t 8 gives the conditions:

2 {rea  reb  rec}  zz,

2 {ima  imb  imc}  zz.

(3.12)

the anomaly condition becomes,

where n is the number of branes.

16(cid:8)|a|2 + |b|2 + |c|2(cid:9) + n =


24

,

(3.13)

since we will consider orbifolds of t 8, we also need to ensure that g/2 has (half)-

integer intersections with all 4-cycles coming from the twisted sectors. we will need to

check this condition in a case by case basis, but one possibility can be removed immediately.
certain twisted sectors can give rise to operators o which correspond to (2, 2) forms.
however the two-point function of o with g satises,

< go >= 0,

(3.14)

because o is charged under the orbifold gauge group. the remaining possibility is three-
point functions of the form,

< gp p  >,

(3.15)

where the two-forms p and p  carry opposite discrete charge.

as a rst example of this kind, let us revisit k31  k32 where we realize k3i by

t 4/zz2. we therefore quotient t 8 by zz2  zz2 generated by,

g1 : (z1, z2)(z1, z2)
g2 : (z3, z4)(z3, z4).

the form (3.11) is invariant under this action, and for appropriate choices of a, b and c,

we obtain supersymmetric compactications. for example, the choice

a = 1 +

i
2

b =

1
2

15

c = 0,

cancels the anomaly without any branes. to check that g/2 is an integer form, we need
to compute (3.15). first we note that g 1 = g 2 = 0 for i the volume form of k3i.
this guarantees that if p and p  are two-forms from the same k3, (3.15) vanishes. the
remaining possibility is when p and p  are charged under dierent zz2 actions in which
case (3.15) vanishes by charge conservation.

a more interesting example is the zz2 quotient by the action,

g1 : (z1, z2, z3, z4)(z1, z2, z3, z4).

this space has singularities which cannot be resolved. however, it is perfectly ne as an

m theory or type iia compactication. string orbifold techniques give /24 = 16. the

hodge numbers are:

h 2,0 = 6, h 1,1 = 16, h 2,1 = 0, h 3,1 = 16, h 2,2 = 292.

as usual, h 4,0 = 1. tuning a, b and c appropriately gives solutions that cancel the

tadpole either partially or completely. for example, the choice a = 1 completely cancels

the tadpole with just g-ux. checking that g/2 is integer is easy in this case because
there are no twisted sector two-forms p. the only operators are four-forms o whose
intersection with g/2 vanishes.

our next example is the symmetric product of k3. we therefore quotient by the

action,

g1 : (z1, z2)(z1, z2)
g2 : (z3, z4)(z3, z4)
g3 : (z1, z2, z3, z4)(z3, z4, z1, z2).

this compactication space has n=3 supersymmetry in three dimensions because s2(k3)

is a hyperkahler space. in this case, /24 = 27/2. the hodge numbers are:

h 2,0 = 1, h 1,1 = 21, h 2,1 = 0, h 3,1 = 21, h 2,2 = 232.

to obtain a consistent compactication, we therefore need to turn on g-ux. note that

invariance under the g3 action requires that b and c be real.
be half-integer quantized [14]. at rst sight it seems that this additional freedom is not

in this case, g/2 can

enough to nd a solution to (3.13). however, the integrality condition

4 {rea  reb  rec}  zz,

4 {ima}  zz

(3.16)

16

permits the possibility,

a =

1
4

b =

5
8

c =

5
8

.

(3.17)

with this choice g/2 survives the quotienting and can cancel the anomaly completely.

an alternative is to set c = 0 and add a single membrane.

to conrm that g/2 is indeed half-integral, we need to check that the intersection of

g/2 with all twisted sector states is also half-integral. the intersections with the twisted

sector states corresponding to the generators g1 and g2 vanish by exactly the arguments
given for the t 8/(zz2)2 example above. we therefore only need to check the condition
for twisted sector states generated by g3. for this purpose, it is easier to consider s2(t 4)
rather than s2(k3). this simplication is possible because the unique twisted sector (1, 1)
form on s2(k3) descends from the unique twisted sector (1, 1) form on s2(t 4).

locus which is the diagonal four-torus t 4
by blowing up y over the diagonal t 4

denote s2(t 4) by x and let ex be its resolution obtained by blowing up over the xed
d.3 let y = t 4  t 4 and ey be the space obtained
d. there are projections q and p from ey to y and
ex to x respectively. the involution i : y  x lifts to an involution s : ey  ex, which is

branched over the exceptional divisor. we can summarize this information in the following

commutative diagram:

ey

(3.18)

form:

now consider a form   h 2,2(y )  h 4(y, zz). for example, the form dened in (3.11).
this form can be pulled back to ey giving q  h 2,2(ey ) and then pushed forward to a

e = s(q)  h 2,2(ex).
note that ey is a double cover of ex. therefore s(sv) = 2v for any form v on ey and we
have se = 2q. consider the integral twisted sector (1, 1) formet  h 1,1(ex)  h 4(ex, zz)
which is poincare dual to the exceptional divisor in ex. then

3 we wish to thank d.-e. diaconescu for explaining the following argument.

set = 2t,

17

where t  h 1,1(ey )  h 4(ey , zz) is poincare dual to the exceptional divisor in ey . this is
true again because ey is a double cover of ex and s is branched over the exceptional divisor.

the relevant three point function we wish to compute is

=

1
2

<et2 e >ex

< s(et2 e) >ey

= 2 < t2  se >ey

= 4 < t2  q >ey

d is trivial, we see that the exceptional divisor

.

since the normal bundle of the diagonal t 4
d corresponding to t is just ip1  t 4

d. the intersection is then

8 < t 4

d  q >ey

= 8 < t 4

d   >y .

but this can now be readily computed: rst it is easy to check that the contributions from
the a and a terms vanish because the forms themselves vanish on t 4
d. the other terms

yield the following integrality condition for half-integral g-ux,

128(b + c)  zz.

while this was derived for s2(t 4), the same condition can be seen to hold for the symmetric

product of k3 in the orbifold limit. this condition is satised for our choice (3.17) of g-
ux.4

lastly, we consider an example which gives n=2 supersymmetry in three dimensions.

we quotient by,

g1 : (z1, z2)(z1, z2)
g2 : (z1, z3)(z1, z3)
g3 : (z2, z4)(z2, z4).

the quotient group essentially inverts all possible pairs of tori. for this case, /24 = 28.

the hodge numbers are:

h 2,0 = 0, h 1,1 = 100, h 2,1 = 0, h 3,1 = 4, h 2,2 = 460.

4 the symmetric product is a highly singular space. however, we can smooth the space by
blowing up the symmetric product x = s2(k3) over the xed locus. this amounts to replacing
x by the hilbert scheme of points k3[2]. see, for example, [20]. in a diagram analogous to (3.18),

ex = k3[2] and p : k3[2]x. if we want p(g/) to be a primitive element of h 2,2(k3[2], zz), we

need to impose at least one additional condition on (3.11). the kahler class of k3[2] has a term
proportional to the class of the exceptional divisor. to ensure primitivity, we can require that

g/ vanish on the xed locus, which implies that b = c. this is a natural way to get a smooth

hyperkahler compactication. we wish to thank l. gottsche for pointing out this generalization.

18

as a sample choice of g-ux, we can take

a = 1 +

i
2

b =

1
2

+

i
2

c = 0,

which cancels the anomaly completely. to check that g/2 is integer, we need to check

that it has integer periods over all integer homology cycles. for the untwisted sector cycles,

this reduces to verifying (3.12), which is obvious. for the twisted sector cycles, it is easy to
repeat the arguments presented for the previous t 8/(zz2)2 example to show that all three
point functions of type (3.15) vanish.

3.3. an orientifold example

in a similar way, we can construct four-dimensional orientifold examples with constant
uxes. we start with an orbifold of the form t 6/. again for simplicity let us take
t 6 = t 2  t 2  t 2 with each factor rectangular and coordinates (z1, z2, z3). we can view
an orientifold of t 6/ as a special point in the moduli space of f theory compactied on
the elliptically-bered four-fold [6],

m =

t 6/  t 2

zz2

,

where the zz2 action inverts both z3 and the coordinate, z4, of the ber t 2. this f theory
compactication reduces to the orientifold of type iib on t 6/ by the action (1)fl zz2
where the zz2 inverts z3. this action produces various o7-planes at complex codimension
one xed sets on t 6. by adding d7-planes, we can cancel the o7-plane charge. fixed
points under group elements in the product of (1)fl zz2 and  generate o3-planes. the
total d3-brane tadpole is (m)/24.

as a specic example, we can take the following generators for ,

g1 : (z1, z2)(z1, z2)
g2 : (z1, z3)(z1, z3).

the resulting calabi-yau t 6/ has hodge numbers h1,1 = 51, h2,1 = 3. the associated
four-fold m is the nal example of section 3.2. this orientifold and its relation to f theory
has been studied in [21,22]. to cancel the anomaly without using any d3-branes, we can

turn on the uxes

h = a dz1dz2dz3 + a dz1dz2dz3 + b dz1dz2dz3 + b dz1dz2dz3,
h  = ai dz1dz2dz3  ai dz1dz2dz3  bi dz1dz2dz3 + bi dz1dz2dz3,

(3.19)

with the choice:

a = 1 +

i
2

b =

1
2

+

i
2

.

it is interesting to note that the same four-fold can give rise to many dierent orientifolds

depending on the choice of c and g-ux. this point will be explored more fully elsewhere.

19

4. a heterotic compactication with torsion

in this section, we will construct an example of a four-dimensional so(32) heterotic

string compactication with torsion. this particular example has either n=1 or n=2

spacetime supersymmetry, depending on the choice of ux. we begin with type iib com-
pactied on an orientifold of k3  t 2. after a series of t and s dualities, we will arrive
at our heterotic model.

the initial iib supergravity metric is conformal to the metric on k3  t 2. the
solution still possesses two isometries along the t 2. two t-dualities along the two circles
of t 2 sends (1)fl zz2 to  [17]. in other words, it takes our f theory compactication
with uxes to a type i theory. in the subsequent discussion, we will specify the resulting

type i background. if we choose to use only d3-branes and no background ux to cancel
the anomaly, the resulting theory is type i on k3  t 2 with 24 d5-branes wrapping the
t 2. with background uxes, the result is quite dierent. we will nd type i compactied
on a space b with the following properties:

1. it is a complex manifold which is not kahler, or even conformally calabi-yau.

2. it has vanishing rst chern class.
3. it has a non-zero h -ux.

after a further s-duality, we end up with the so(32) heterotic string compactied on b
with a non-zero h-ux.

4.1. mapping the parameters and couplings

let us consider the orientifold of type iib on k3 t 2 with a square t 2 by the action
(1)fl zz2. the zz2 action sends z1  z1 where z1 is the coordinate of the t 2. this
compactication is a special point in the moduli space of f theory on k3  k3. let the
t 2 have sides of length r1 and r2, and volume ev = r1r2. we will take the k3 to have

volume v . at the orientifold point, the ten-dimensional string coupling is a free parameter

which we will take to be gb.

two t-duality transformations along t 2 invert the radii in the usual way,

where i = 1, 2. the resulting type i theory has the following couplings and volumes:

ri  /ri,

g(4)

i = gb/pvev ,

g(10)

i = gb/ev ,

20

evi = 2/ev ,

vi = v.

(4.1)

here g(4) and g(10) denote the four and ten-dimensional couplings. the o7-planes and
d7-branes are mapped to an o9 d9 system. if, for simplicity, we assume a trivial seven-
brane gauge-eld conguration over k31 then the initial gauge group is so(8)4. the
gauge-elds of the resulting o9  d9 theory then have non-trivial wilson lines. under
a further s-duality transformation, we get the heterotic so(32) theory. the resulting

couplings and volumes can again be written in terms of iib variables,

g(4)

het =pgb/(v ),

g(10)

het = ev /(gb),

evhet = /gb,

vhet = vev 2/(g2

b2).

our initial iib supergravity description is valid in the limit where,

(4.2)

(4.3)

ev /, v /()2 >> 1.

if we want a weakly coupled orientifold theory, we can also take gb to be small but that

is not necessary. under condition (4.3), both the heterotic and type i four-dimensional
couplings can be made small. if gb is small, then an  expansion of the resulting heterotic
string theory is a good approximation.

4.2. the type iib solution

to obtain the type iib supergravity metric, we begin with m theory on m = k31 
t 4/zz2. if we choose a smooth k31 then our resulting type iib metric will be smooth. we
can also consider orbifold cases where k31 = t 4/ where the metric is explicitly known.
otherwise, our resulting heterotic solution is given in terms of the metric of k31. we
will use coordinates wa for k31. we again take t 4 = t 2  t 2 with coordinates (z1, z2)
and each factor square. our initial m theory metric is then of the form (2.16) with g the
metric on m. we can choose to completely or partially cancel the anomaly with g-ux
satisfying,

1

2zm

g
2 

g
2

+ n = 24.

using arguments along the lines discussed in section 3, we can construct a g with the form

g
2

=   dz1dz2 +   dz1dz2 +   dz1dz2 +   dz1dz2,

(4.4)

where   h 1,1(k31) and   h 2,0(k31). note that if  = 0, the model has n=2
supersymmetry.

21

we treat the z2 direction as the elliptic ber, and lift this m theory vacuum to a type

iib orientifold of k31  t 2. the resulting background uxes are given by,

h = ( + )  dz1 + ( + )  dz1
h  = (  +  )  dz1 + (  +  )  dz1.

we note that h and h  can be expressed in the form,

h = d(cid:8)+   dz1 + +  dz1(cid:9)
h  = d(cid:8) +    dz1 +  +   dz1(cid:9) .

the potentials  are not globally dened forms on the space k31  t 2, but satisfy
d = .

in string frame, the type iib supergravity metric has the form:

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

(cid:18)  

0

0

eg.(cid:19)

the indices ,  = 0, . . . , 4 andeg is the metric of k31  t 2/zz2. the warp factors  and

 depend on the internal coordinates. we can determine  and  in the following way.

let us reduce from m theory to type iia along a side of the elliptic ber. the metric of

the torus is warped,

e/2dz2dz2.

the resulting type iia metric in string frame is given by [23],

giia = e/4g(10),

(4.8)

where g(10) is the straight dimensional reduction of the m theory metric. using the metric
(2.16), we nd that:

 = ()1 = e3/4.

(4.9)

lastly, let us recall that the warp factor is determined by equation (2.5). there are

three source terms on the right hand side of this equation. both the x8 curvature term and
the membrane term are suppressed by six powers of mpl relative to the g g source term.
to leading order in the derivative expansion, we can neglect the eect of both terms.5

5

it is worth noting that there is an obstruction to solving the warp factor equation (2.5).

however, if the anomaly cancellation condition (1.2) is satised then the obstruction vanishes.

the x8 and membrane terms are then crucial for ensuring the existence of a solution for the warp
factor.

22

with the form of g-ux given in (4.4), the warp factor will have no dependence on (z1, z2)
at the level of the supergravity solution.

we can see this directly in type iib supergravity. the only non-vanishing component

of d+ is given by,

the self-dual eld strength f + given in (2.28) obeys [24],

d+

 = e3/2.

d  f + =h  h  + (42)2(cid:26) 1

i are the locations of the o7-plane plus four d7-branes, and (z1

where z1
locations of the d3-branes. from (4.10), we obtain an equation for the warp factor:

j , wj) are the

(4.11)

again the h  h  term is constant in z1 while the remaining source terms are suppressed
by powers of .

4.3. dualizing to a type i solution

to arrive at a type i solution, we t-dualize along both sides of the t 2 with coordinate
z1 = x1 + iy1. using buschers duality [25] and [26,27,28], we can express the type i metric
gi and rr two-form bi in terms of our initial type iib quantities. since h and h  can
be expressed in the form (4.6), we only have bxa, b
ya components. the type
i metric is then given by,6

note that we have used the fact that d+ has no internal components in the above expres-

sions. if we set either  or  to zero in (4.5), then one can check using the local expressions
(4.6) for b and b that bi

ab = 0.

using coordinates wa for k31, we can rewrite the type i metric in a way that makes

the structure a little clearer:

(dx + bxadwa)2 +

(dy + byadwa)2 .

(4.15)

ds2 = egabdwadwb +

the t 2 parametrized by x and y is now non-trivially twisted over the base k31. by viewing
bxadwa and byadwa as kaluza-klein gauge-elds, we see that the twisting is encoded in
the characteristic classes of these gauge-elds on k31.

since t-duality is a perturbative symmetry, we have arrived at a consistent type

i background (4.12), (4.13) and (4.14). we can s-dualize to a perturbative heterotic

compactication with dilaton,

torsional string compactications satisfy a number of stringent constraints. see

[29,30,31,32,33] for a discussion of various aspects of torsional compactications. as a

nal comment, we note that since our torsional vacuum is t-dual to an anomaly free ori-

entifold, we can infer a great deal about the resulting metric and b-eld. our space should

24

have trivial rst chern class. since no so(32) gauge-elds are excited, p1(b) must also
be trivial in cohomology to satisfy the usual anomaly cancellation condition,

dh het = tr(r  r) 

1
30

tr(f  f ).

this is not as implausible as it might rst seem. in the e8e8 heterotic dual to the original
type iib orientifold, p1(k3) is cancelled by embedding instantons in some abelian gauge-
elds. it seems reasonable that the instantons in the kaluza-klein gauge-elds bxadwa
and byadwa could analogously cancel p1(k3) in this case. finally, it should be possible
to show that the metric (4.17) and h het are derivable from a real prepotential, analogous

to the kahler potential [29].
