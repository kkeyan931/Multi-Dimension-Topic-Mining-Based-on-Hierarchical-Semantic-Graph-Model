on counting special lagrangian homology

3-spheres

1 introduction

recently, strominger, yau and zaslow [17] proposed an interpretation of mir-
ror symmetry for calabi-yau 3-folds m involving brations of m by special
lagrangian 3-tori, allowing singular bres. this has aroused a great deal
of interest in special lagrangian 3-folds amongst mathematicians and physi-
cists  see for instance the papers of gross [4, 5], or ruan [15]. probably the
most dicult mathematical problems in verifying the syz conjecture lie in
understanding the singularities of special lagrangian 3-folds and brations,
and their compactness properties.

general singularities occurring in families of special lagrangian 3-folds
are at present rather poorly understood. in this paper we study two kinds of
singularities of special lagrangian 3-folds. we rst describe these locally in
c3, and then we explain what happens when a compact special lagrangian
3-fold n in a calabi-yau 3-fold m develops a singularity with this local
model, and how this depends on the topology of n.

our aim in doing this is to contribute to the understanding of special
lagrangian 3-fold singularities by providing some well worked out examples
of local and global behaviour. therefore we try to be quite explicit and
detailed. the local models we use are mainly due to harvey and lawson [7],
in 1982. so it is likely that parts of the picture we present have also been
worked out by other researchers in the eld; however, at the time of writing
the author knows of no papers which overlap signicantly with this one.

but our paper has a second goal, which is much more speculative and
poorly supported by proofs. it is to dene an invariant of calabi-yau 3-folds
m by counting special lagrangian homology 3-spheres in each homology

1

class, and consider how it behaves under deformations of m. this is in-
spired by the theory of gromov-witten invariants and quantum cohomology,
where one denes an invariant of symplectic manifolds by counting pseudo-
holomorphic curves.

let m be a calabi-yau 3-fold. for each   h3(m, z), let s() be the
set of special lagrangian rational homology 3-spheres in m with homology
class . suppose s() is nite. then we dene

i() = xn s()

w(n),

(1)

where w(n) is a integer-valued weight function depending on the topology
of n. actually, when n is a d-fold cover of another special lagrangian 3-fold
n , the correct weight is not w(n) but w(n)/d, and thus i() is a rational
number. so we have a map i : h3(m, z)  q, which is our invariant.
in the moduli space of calabi-yau structures on m there are certain
special real hypersurfaces, determined using the homology of m. at such
a hypersurface, some of the special lagrangian 3-folds in m will become
singular. a special lagrangian 3-fold may exist in m only on one side of the
hypersurface, and become singular at the hypersurface. more generally, as
we approach the hypersurface from one side one or more special lagrangian
3-folds may collapse down to a single singular 3-fold, and then on the other
side this singular 3-fold is replaced by a dierent collection of one or more
special lagrangian 3-folds.

now our invariant i will only be really interesting if it is stable under
deformations of the underlying calabi-yau 3-fold m. so we wish to ensure
that as we pass through such a hypersurface in the calabi-yau moduli space,
i is either unchanged, or at least transforms according to some rigid set of
rules.

using our models of singularities of special lagrangian 3-folds, we explic-
itly describe two kinds of transition of the set of special lagrangian 3-folds
as we pass through a real hypersurface in the calabi-yau moduli space.
we use these transitions to calculate identities which the weight function
w(n) in (1) must satisfy for i to be invariant, or transform nicely, as we
pass through the hypersurface. it turns out that the simple weight function

w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) satises these identities.

motivated by this, we x w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12), and formulate a conjecture,

conjecture 8.3, on how i transforms under deformations of the calabi-yau

2

3-fold m. this is based on examining in detail only two kinds of transition;
there are probably lots of other kinds of transitions, and these may invalidate
the conjecture.

i freely admit that conjecture 8.3 is based on very slim evidence, and may
turn out to be entirely wrong. the thing which persuaded me to publish it
is the very neat way in which the transitions i studied seemed to determine
w more or less uniquely, and then nding that this weight function counts
something meaningful in string theory.

we begin in 2 with an introduction to special lagrangian geometry. our
denition of a special lagrangian 3-fold in a calabi-yau 3-fold is not quite
conventional: we allow the special lagrangian 3-fold to have a phase ei,
which is important because later we will consider congurations of special
lagrangian 3-folds with dierent phases.

sections 3-5 study singular special lagrangian 3-folds locally modelled on
a cone on t 2 in c3. such singular 3-folds n0 can appear as the limit of a
family of nonsingular 3-folds nt, t > 0, in which a circle in nt shrinks to a
point. we show that there are not one but three dierent ways of resolving
n0 with such a family nj,t, for t > 0 and j = 1, 2, 3, and we investigate
the topology of nj,t and determine on which side of the real hypersurface it
exists.

sections 6 and 7 give a similar analysis of another kind of singularity, lo-
cally modelled on the union of two special lagrangian 3-planes in c3. such
singular 3-folds can appear as the limit of a family of nonsingular 3-folds
in which a 2-sphere s2 shrinks to a point. however, in this case the sin-
gular limit can often be regarded as the union of two nonsingular special
lagrangian 3-folds.

therefore we ask if, given special lagrangian 3-folds n + and n  inter-
secting at a point p, we can nd a family of special lagrangian 3-folds n
dieomorphic to n +#n , and converging to the singular union n +  n .
the answer turns out to depend on the phases of n +, n  and n in an
interesting way.

finally, in 8 we use the ideas of 3-7 to guess a good denition for our
invariant i, and make a conjecture about its behaviour. we also speculate
about the relevance of our ideas to string theory, about possible generaliza-
tions of our invariant, and about its applications to the study of the global
structure of the moduli space of complex structures on m.

the author hopes to publish a subsequent paper [9] giving constructions
of families of special lagrangian 3-folds in c3, and more general calibrated

3

submanifolds in rn. these will give a number of other local models for how
families of special lagrangian 3-folds can develop singularities.

2 calabi-yau and special lagrangian

geometry

2.1 calabi-yau manifolds

denition 2.1 let (m, j) be a compact complex manifold of dimension
m  2, and g a kahler metric on m with kahler form . then the holonomy
group hol(g) is a subgroup of u(m). we call (m, j, g) a calabi-yau manifold
if hol(g)  su(m).
the canonical bundle km = m,0 of a calabi-yau manifold (m, j, g) is
isomorphic to the trivial holomorphic line bundle m  c. thus c1(m) = 0 in
h 2(m, z), where c1(m) is the rst chern class. also, m has a holomorphic
volume form , which is a non-vanishing holomorphic section of km , and
satises  = 0, where  is the levi-civita connection of g. this  is
unique up to a complex factor, but we can normalize  by requiring that

m/m! = (1)m(m1)/2(i/2)m  .

(2)

then  is unique up to a factor ei for   r.

every calabi-yau manifold is ricci-at. conversely, a compact, simply-
connected ricci-at kahler manifold (m, j, g) is a calabi-yau manifold; but
if m is not simply-connected then km may not be trivial, so that  exists
locally but not globally on m. from yaus solution of the calabi conjecture
[19] we deduce an existence theorem for calabi-yau metrics.

theorem 2.2 (yau) let (m, j) be a compact complex manifold with trivial
canonical bundle km , admitting kahler metrics. then there is a unique
ricci-at kahler metric g in each kahler class on m, and then (m, j, g) is
a calabi-yau manifold.

using algebraic geometry one can nd many examples of projective com-
pact complex manifolds with trivial canonical bundle, such as the quintic in
cp4, and all of these admit families of calabi-yau metrics.

2.2 calibrated geometry

next we discuss the theory of calibrated geometry, as in harvey and law-
son [7].

denition 2.3 let (m, g) be a riemannian manifold. an oriented tangent
k-plane v on m is a vector subspace v of some tangent space tpm to m
with dim v = k, equipped with an orientation. if v is an oriented tangent
k-plane on m then g|v is a euclidean metric on v , so combining g|v with the
orientation on v gives a natural volume form volv on v , which is a k-form
on v .

now let  be a closed k-form on m. we say that  is a calibration on m
if for every oriented k-plane v on m we have |v  volv . here |v = volv
for some   r, and |v  volv if   1. let n be an oriented submanifold
of m with dimension k. then each tangent space tpn for p  n is an
oriented tangent k-plane. we say that n is a calibrated submanifold or -
submanifold if |tpn = voltpn for all p  n.

if (m, g) is a riemannian manifold,  a calibration on m of degree k,

and n a compact oriented submanifold of m of dimension k, then

[]  [n] = zpn

(cid:12)(cid:12)tpn  zpn

voltpn = vol(n),

where []  [n] is the product between the de rham cohomology class [] 
h k(m, r) and the homology class [n]  hk(m, r). thus vol(n)  []  [n],
and equality holds if and only if n is a calibrated submanifold. so a compact
calibrated submanifold is a minimal submanifold, as it is volume-minimizing
in its homology class. noncompact calibrated submanifolds are also locally
minimizing.

since we shall be discussing families of submanifolds, convergence of sub-
manifolds and singular submanifolds in this paper, we had better be clear
about what we mean by submanifold. recall that there are two main con-
cepts of nonsingular submanifold: immersed and embedded submanifolds.
denition 2.4 let n, m be manifolds and f : n  m a smooth map.
we say that f is an immersion if df|n : tnn  tf (n)m is injective for each
n  n, and that f is an embedding if it is an injective immersion. also, f is
proper if whenever c  m is compact then f 1(c) is compact.
an immersed submanifold of m is the image f (n) of a proper immersion
f : n  m, and an embedded submanifold f (n) of m is the image of a proper

5

embedding f : n  m. requiring f to be proper means that submanifolds
f (n) are automatically closed in m.

for most of the paper it will not matter whether we consider submanifolds
to be immersed or embedded, as we will be interested only in local questions.
but in 8 we nd it natural to count immersed special lagrangian homology
3-spheres, rather than embedded ones. we will also need to discuss singular
submanifolds. there is an elegant and powerful theory of singular submani-
folds called geometric measure theory, which is described in federer [1] and
morgan [13]. we dene a singular submanifold to be an integral current, in
the sense of geometric measure theory.

harvey and lawson [7, ii] use integral and rectiable currents in their
theory of calibrated geometry. integral currents are important tools in the
study of minimal submanifolds (and hence calibrated submanifolds), because
there are compactness theorems for integral currents which enable one to
easily construct volume-minimizing currents. there are also regularity results
due to almgren which show that the singularities of a volume-minimizing
current have codimension at least two.

we will not actually use any geometric measure theory in this paper 
we will simply suppose that we know a singular submanifold when we see
one. but anyone who wants a formal denition of singular submanifold, or
to know exactly what we mean when we say that a family of submanifolds
nt converges to a singular submanifold n0 as t  0, is advised to look at
morgan [13].

2.3 special lagrangian submanifolds in cm

we shall be interested in special lagrangian submanifolds in cm and in
calabi-yau manifolds. for reasons explained later, we will dene special la-
grangian submanifolds slightly dierently in these two situations. we begin
with special lagrangian submanifolds in cm.
denition 2.5 let cm have complex coordinates (z1, . . . , zm), and dene
a metric g0, a real 2-form 0 and a complex m-form 0 on cm by
g0 = |dz1|2 +    + |dzm|2, 0 =

(dz1  dz1 +    + dzm  dzm),

i
2

and 0 = dz1      dzm.

then re 0 and im 0 are real m-forms on cm. let l be an oriented real
submanifold of cm of real dimension m. we say that l is a special lagrangian

6

(3)

submanifold of cm if l is calibrated w.r.t. re 0, in the sense of denition 2.3.

harvey and lawson [7, cor. iii.1.11] give the following alternative char-

acterization of special lagrangian submanifolds.

proposition 2.6 let l be a real m-dimensional submanifold of cm. then
l admits an orientation making it into a special lagrangian submanifold of
cm if and only if 0|l  0 and im 0|l  0.

note that an m-dimensional submanifold l in cm is called lagrangian if
0|l  0. thus special lagrangian submanifolds are lagrangian submani-
folds satisfying the extra condition that im 0|l  0, which is how they get
their name.
denition 2.7 let l be a (singular) special lagrangian submanifold in cm.
we say that l is a cone in cm if l = tl for all t > 0, where tl = {tx : x  l}.
let l be a special lagrangian cone in cm. then either l is an m-plane rm
in cm, or 0 is a singular point of l.

we are particularly interested in cones in which 0 is the only singular
point. suppose l is nonsingular except at 0, and dene  to be l  s2m1,
the intersection of l with the unit sphere s2m1 in cm. then  is a compact,
nonsingular manifold of dimension m1, and we refer to l as the cone on .
for example, we shall later consider special lagrangian cones on t 2 in c3.
now let l be a nonsingular special lagrangian submanifold in cm. we
say that l is asymptotically conical, or ac for short, if there exists a special
lagrangian cone l0 in cm, nonsingular except at 0, such that l is asymptotic
to l0 to order o(r1) as r  , where r is the radius function in cm. we
call l0 the asymptotic cone of l.

here is why we are interested in conical and asymptotically conical special
lagrangian submanifolds. let l and l0 be as above, with l0 singular at 0.
it is easy to see that if t > 0 then tl is also ac, and that tl  l0 as t 
0+. thus the singular special lagrangian submanifold l0 is the limit of the
family of nonsingular special lagrangian submanifolds {tl : t > 0}. so ac
special lagrangian submanifolds provide local models for how singularities
can develop in families of nonsingular special lagrangian submanifolds.

by combining the ideas of mclean [12, 3] on the deformation theory of
compact special lagrangian submanifolds with some analysis on noncompact
manifolds with asymptotically conical ends, one can prove the following result
on deformation of ac special lagrangian manifolds.

7

theorem 2.8 let l be a nonsingular, ac special lagrangian submanifold
in cm, asymptotic to the special lagrangian cone l0. then the moduli space
of ac special lagrangian submanifolds in cm asymptotic to l0 is near l a
smooth manifold of dimension b1
c (l, r),
and h 

c(l) = dim h j
c (l, r) is the compactly-supported de rham cohomology of l.

c(l) + bm1

(l), where bj

c

note that the compactly-supported de rham cohomology group h k

c (l, r)
is naturally isomorphic to the homology group hmk(l, r), where homology
is as usual calculated using chains with compact support. thus b1
c(l) +
bm1
c

(l) = bm1(l) + b1(l).
suppose l is an ac special lagrangian m-fold in cm, asymptotic to the
cone l0. then for any   su(m) we see that   l is another ac special
lagrangian m-fold, asymptotic to l0. let g be the lie subgroup of su(m)
with   l0 = l0, and g0 the connected component of g containing 1.
then {  l :   g0} is a connected family of ac special lagrangian
submanifolds asymptotic to l0. we can regard it as a family of deformations
of l. however, using the ideas of mclean [12, 3], it can be shown that all
these deformations are actually trivial. thus   l = l for all   g0, and
we have proved:

proposition 2.9 let l be a nonsingular ac special lagrangian submanifold
in cm, asymptotic to the cone l0. let g be the lie subgroup of su(m)
preserving l0, and g0 the connected component of g containing 1. then l
is preserved by g0.

2.4 special lagrangian submanifolds in

calabi-yau manifolds

next we dene special lagrangian submanifolds in calabi-yau manifolds.

denition 2.10 let (m, j, g) be a calabi-yau manifold of complex dimen-
sion m with kahler form , and let  be a holomorphic volume form on m,
normalized to satisfy (2). then re  and im  are real, closed m-forms on m.
fix   r. then cos  re +sin  im  is a calibration on m. let n be a ori-
ented real m-dimensional submanifold of m. we call n a special lagrangian
submanifold with phase ei if n is calibrated w.r.t. cos  re  + sin  im .

this is not the conventional denition: it is usual simply to dene a special
lagrangian manifold to be calibrated w.r.t. re , as in denition 2.5. we

8

have changed the denition because we will later need to consider several
special lagrangian manifolds n1, n2, . . . in dierent homology classes in m
with dierent phases, so we can discuss what happens to special lagrangian
submanifolds as we vary []  h m(m, c).

from proposition 2.6 we deduce:

proposition 2.11 let (m, j, g), m,  and  be as above, and choose   r.
suppose n is a real m-dimensional submanifold of m. then the following
are equivalent:

(i) there is a unique orientation on n making n into a special lagrangian

submanifold with phase ei, and

(ii) |n  0 and (sin  re   cos  im )|n  0.

thus, if n is a special lagrangian submanifold in m with phase ei, then

zn

cos  re  + sin  im  = vol(n)

and

zn

sin  re   cos  im  = 0.

so we see that:

corollary 2.12 let (m, j, g) be a calabi-yau manifold with holomorphic
volume form , and n a compact special lagrangian submanifold of m with
phase ei. then

[re ]  [n] = vol(n) cos 

and [im ]  [n] = vol(n) sin ,

where [re ], [im ]  h m(m, r) and [n]  hm(m, r). thus the homology
class [n] determines both the phase ei and the volume vol(n) of n.

the deformation theory of special lagrangian submanifolds was studied

by mclean [12, 3], who proved the following result.
theorem 2.13 let (m, j, g) be a calabi-yau manifold, and n a compact
special lagrangian submanifold of m. then the moduli space m of special
lagrangian submanifolds in m is near n a smooth manifold of dimension
b1(n), the rst betti number of n.

9

the idea in the proof of this theorem is that an innitesimal deformation
of n as a submanifold in m corresponds to a section of the normal bundle
 of n in m. but because n is lagrangian, contracting with  gives an
isomorphism between the vector bundles  and t n over n. so there is a 1-
1 correspondence between innitesimal deformations of n in m and 1-forms
 on n.

mclean shows that  corresponds to an innitesimal deformation of n
as a special lagrangian submanifold if and only if d = d = 0. but as n is
compact, by hodge theory the vector space of 1-forms  with d = d = 0
is isomorphic to h 1(n, r), and so has dimension b1(n).

for simplicity we will suppose that the moduli space m of special la-
grangian submanifolds in m near n is connected and simply-connected, and
that each member of m is an embedded submanifold dieomorphic to n. it
is well-known that m not only has dimension b1(n), but is actually naturally
isomorphic to an open subset of an ane space am,n modelled on the vector
space h 1(n, r). an account of this can be found in hitchin [8, 4].
write n  for a general member of m. one way to dene coordinates
on am,n is to use the relative homology groups h2(m; n , z). each element
  h2(m; n , z) is represented by a compact, oriented surface  in m,
with boundary in n . as |n   0 it turns out that r  depends only on
  h2(m; n , z), and not on the choice of representative . in fact we may
regard  as dening a class [] in the relative de rham cohomology group
h 2(m; n , r), and r  = []  .
as m is connected and simply-connected and all n   m are embedded,
we can naturally identify the groups h2(m; n , z) for all n   m. this
gives an isomorphism h2(m; n , z) = h2(m; n, z) for each n   m. for
each   h2(m; n, z), dene a function f : m  r by f(n ) = r ,
where  is a compact, oriented surface in m with boundary in n , whose
homology class [] in h2(m; n , z) is identied with   h2(m; n, z).
it can be shown that m has the structure of an open set in an ane
space am,n modelled on h 1(n, r), and that each f is the restriction to m
of an ane linear function on am,n . if the image of h1(n, r) in h1(m, r)
is zero, then we can use a collection of the functions f as ane coordinates
on m.
in fact there is a second way to regard m as a subspace of an ane
space. as n is a compact oriented m-manifold, we have b1(n) = bm1(n)
by poincare duality, and so m is a manifold of dimension bm1(n).
it
turns out that we can embed m as an open subset in a dierent ane

10

m,n .

here is how to dene ane linear coordinates on a

space a
m,n modelled on h m1(n, r). furthermore, the product am,n 
a
m,n is naturally a symplectic manifold (as h 1(n, r) and h m1(n, r) are
dual vector spaces), and m can be regarded as a lagrangian submanifold
of am,n  a
m,n . suppose for sim-
plicity that n has phase 1. then im |n  0. as above we can identify the
relative homology groups hm(m; n , z) with hm(m; n, z) for all n   m.
fix   hm(m; n, z). then the corresponding element of hm(m; n , z) is
represented by an m-chain  in m, with boundary in n . as im |n   0 we
see that r im  depends only on , and not on the choice of representative .
so dene a function f : m  r by f(n ) = r im , where  is
any m-chain representing  in hm(m; n , z). these functions f for  
hm(m; n, z) are ane linear on a
m,n , and if the image of hm1(n, r) in
hm1(m, r) is zero, then we can use a collection of the functions f as
coordinates on m.
our next result concerns the stability of compact special lagrangian sub-
manifolds n under small deformations of the underlying calabi-yau m-fold
(m, j, g). mclean does not discuss this question, but it can be answered by
the same techniques used to prove theorem 2.13.

theorem 2.14 suppose (m, j, g) is a calabi-yau manifold, and n a com-
pact, nonsingular special lagrangian submanifold in m. let (m, j, g) be a
nearby calabi-yau structure on m, with kahler form . provided (m, j, g)
is suciently close to (m, j, g), there exists a special lagrangian submanifold
n in (m, j, g) close to n in m if and only if [|n ] = 0 in h 2(n, r).

now consider the case in which n is a compact special lagrangian 3-
manifold with b1(n) = 0. then h1(n, q) = h2(n, q) = 0.
it follows
that h(n, q) = h(s3, q), and so n is called a homology 3-sphere. (by
this we mean a rational homology 3-sphere, not an integral homology 3-
sphere). theorem 2.13 shows that the moduli space of deformations of n
is of dimension 0, and theorem 2.14 shows that n persists under small
deformations of (m, j, g). thus we have:

corollary 2.15 let (m, j, g) be a calabi-yau 3-fold, and n a compact spe-
cial lagrangian homology 3-sphere in m. then n is rigid, that is, it ad-
mits no deformations as a special lagrangian submanifold, and it is also
stable under small deformations (m, j, g) of the underlying calabi-yau 3-
fold (m, j, g).

11

this is important to us, for the following reason. since special lagrangian
homology 3-spheres are rigid, it seems plausible that there should exist only
nitely many special lagrangian homology 3-spheres in any given homology
class in h3(m, z). if this is so, then the number of special lagrangian ho-
mology 3-spheres n in this homology class (perhaps counted with some sign
or weight depending on n) would be an invariant of the calabi-yau 3-fold.
we will discuss this in 8.

3 a family of special lagrangian 3-folds in c3

we begin with a proposition taken from harvey and lawson [7, iii.3.a],
dening an explicit family of special lagrangian 3-folds in c3.

proposition 3.1 let a1, a2, a3 and b be real numbers, and dene a subset
la1,a2,a3,b in c3 by
la1,a2,a3,b = (cid:8)(z1, z2, z3)  c3 :|z1|2  a1 = |z2|2  a2 = |z3|2  a3,

(4)

im(z1z2z3) = b(cid:9).

then la1,a2,a3,b is a special lagrangian 3-fold in c3, wherever it is nonsingu-
lar.

observe that adding a constant to a1, a2 and a3 does not change la1,a2,a3,b,
so la1,a2,a3,b only really depends on 3 real parameters. we nd it convenient
to x the additive constant by requiring that min(a1, a2, a3) = 0.

the reason one can nd these examples explicitly is that they have a large
symmetry group. let g = t 2 be the group of diagonal matrices in su(3),
so that each   g acts on c3 by

for some 1, 2, 3  r with 1 + 2 + 3 = 0. then each la1,a2,a3,b is invariant
under g. in fact, if l is any connected, g-invariant special lagrangian 3-
fold in c3, then l is a subset of some la1,a2,a3,b. our next result gives the
singularities of la1,a2,a3,b.

proposition 3.2 let la1,a2,a3,b be dened by (4), with min(a1, a2, a3) = 0.
then

(i) l0,0,0,0 has one singular point at 0.

(ii) if a1 > 0 then la1,0,0,0 has singular set (cid:8)(a1 ei, 0, 0) :   [0, 2)(cid:9).
(iii) if a2 > 0 then l0,a2,0,0 has singular set (cid:8)(0,a2 ei, 0) :   [0, 2)(cid:9).
(iv) if a3 > 0 then l0,0,a3,0 has singular set (cid:8)(0, 0,a3 ei) :   [0, 2)(cid:9).
(v) if b 6= 0, or if two of a1, a2, a3 are nonzero, then la1,a2,a3,b is nonsin-

gular.

here is a sketch of the proof. dene f1, f2, f3 : c3  r by

f1(z1, z2, z3) = |z1|2  |z3|2,

f2(z1, z2, z3) = |z2|2  |z3|2
and f3(z1, z2, z3) = im(z1z2z3).

then la1,a2,a3,b is dened by the equations f1 = a1  a3, f2 = a2  a3 and
f3 = b. one can show that la1,a2,a3,b is singular at (z1, z2, z3) if and only if
the real 1-forms df1, df2, df3 are linearly dependent at (z1, z2, z3), and this is
a simple calculation.

we now describe the topology of la1,a2,a3,b in cases (i)(v).

1,a1 and l

then l+
1,a1 are both nonsingular, 3-dimensional submanifolds of
c3 dieomorphic to s1  c. comparing (4) and (5) we see that la1,0,0,0 =
1,a1. since la1,0,0,0 is a special lagrangian 3-fold we deduce that l
l+
1,a1 l
1,a1
are also special lagrangian 3-folds, which is easy to verify directly. it can
be shown that l

asymptotic to l
0 .

1,a1 = (cid:8)(a1 ei, 0, 0) :   [0, 2)(cid:9), which is the

singular set of la1,0,0,0 given in proposition 3.2. thus la1,0,0,0 is the union
of two nonsingular special lagrangian 3-folds l+
1,a1, and the singu-
larities of la1,0,0,0 occur at their intersection. note that we could consider
la1,0,0,0 to be a nonsingular, immersed submanifold.

on 1 positive real parameter aj. similarly, the l
j,aj for j = 1, 2, 3 are three
dierent families of ac special lagrangian 3-folds asymptotic to l
0 . this
suggests that if m is a calabi-yau 3-fold, and n a singular special lagrangian
3-fold in m with one singular point modelled on l+
0 , then there may
be three dierent ways to resolve n as a nonsingular special lagrangian
3-fold.
case (v). if b 6= 0, or if two of a1, a2, a3 are nonzero, then it can be shown
that la1,a2,a3,b is nonsingular and dieomorphic to t 2  r.
in particular,
la1,a2,a3,b is connected, and it does not split naturally into two pieces, as in
cases (i)(iv). it has two ends, which are asymptotic to l

0 or l

0 at innity.

here are some remarks on these examples.
 as l+

0 is invariant under g = t 2, which is connected, we see by propo-
sition 2.9 that any ac special lagrangian 3-fold l asymptotic to l+
0
is also g-invariant. but from above, any connected g-invariant special
lagrangian 3-fold is a subset of some la1,a2,a3,b. so by the analysis of
the la1,a2,a3,b above, we see that the l+
j,t for j = 1, 2, 3 and t > 0 are
the only ac special lagrangian 3-folds in c3 asymptotic to l+
0 .

 from above, l+

1,t is dieomorphic to s1  c when t > 0, which has
b1 = 1 and b2 = 0. so by theorem 2.8, the moduli space of ac
special lagrangian 3-folds asymptotic to l+
1,t a manifold of
dimension 1. this agrees with the fact that l+
1,t depends on one real
parameter t.

0 is near l+

 similarly, if b 6= 0 or two of a1, a2, a3 are nonzero, then la1,a2,a3,b is
dieomorphic to t 2  r, which has b1 = 2 and b2 = 1. so by theorem
2.8, the moduli space of ac special lagrangian 3-folds asymptotic to
l+
0  l
0 is near la1,a2,a3,b a manifold of dimension 3. this agrees with
the fact that la1,a2,a3,b depends on 3 real parameters, that is, the 4
parameters a1, a2, a3, b subject to the condition min(a1, a2, a3) = 0.

 let t > 0. then l

1,t is dieomorphic to s1c, and so h1(l

dene subsets d1,t and 1,t in c3 by

1,t, z) = z.

1,t = (cid:8)(t1/2 ei, 0, 0) :   [0, 2)(cid:9),
|z1|2  t(cid:9).

d1,t =(cid:8)(z1, 0, 0) : z1  c,

15

(7)

then 1,t is a smooth, oriented s1 in l+
1,t, and d1,t is a closed, oriented
holomorphic disc in c3 with area t and boundary 1,t. the homology
class of 1,t generates h1(l+
1,t, z). there are similar holomorphic discs
d2,t with boundary 2,t in l+
2,t, and d3,t with boundary 3,t in l+
3,t. we
will explain why this is interesting in 4.

4 a model degeneration of

special lagrangian 3-folds

in 3 we dened a 1-parameter family of special lagrangian 3-folds l+
1,t in
c3, which converged to a singular t 2-cone l+
0 as t  0+. we shall now
treat this as a local model for how a 1-parameter family (cid:8)nt : t  (0, )(cid:9) of
compact, nonsingular special lagrangian 3-folds in a calabi-yau 3-fold m
can converge to a singular special lagrangian 3-fold n0 in m.

let (m, j, g) be a calabi-yau 3-fold with kahler form , let  be a holo-
morphic 3-form on m, and n a compact special lagrangian 3-fold in m
with phase ei. by replacing  by ei we may suppose that n has phase
1. suppose that there exist a small open ball u in m, holomorphic coordi-
nates (z1, z2, z3) on u, and a small constant  > 0 satisfying the following
conditions:

is, u is the open ball of radius  about 0 in c3.

 in coordinates u = (cid:8)(z1, z2, z3)  c3 : |z1|2 + |z2|2 + |z3|2 < 2(cid:9). that
 on u the metric g, kahler form  and 3-form  on m are very close

to the euclidean versions g0, 0, 0 on c3 dened by (3).

 in u, the 3-fold n in m is very close to the 3-fold l+

by (5), for some t with 0 < t  2.

1,t in c3 dened

let 1,t and d1,t be as in (7). since by assumption n is close to l+
1,t
in u, we can choose an oriented circle  in n which is close to 1,t, and a
closed, oriented disc d in u with boundary  which is close to d1,t. let
z be the homology class of  in h1(n, z), and r the homology class of
 in h1(n, r). let  be the homology class of d in the relative homology
group h2(m; n, z).

suppose m is a connected and simply-connected open neighbourhood of
n in the moduli space of special lagrangian 3-folds in m. then m is a

16

manifold of dimension b1(n) by theorem 2.13. furthermore, we explained
in 2.4 why m is isomorphic to an open subset of an ane space am,n
modelled on h 1(n, r), and how to associate a function f : m  r to each
class   h2(m; n, z).
let f : m  r be the function associated to  = [d]  h2(m; n, z).
then f(n) = rd . since d is close to d1,t, and  close to 0, it follows
that rd   rd1,t
0 = t, as it is the area of d1,t, which is a
disc of radius t1/2. therefore f(n)  t. since we are free to change t a
little bit, we can assume that f(n) = t.
let n, n  be special lagrangian 3-folds in m, and x, x the corresponding
points in the ane space am,n . since am,n is modelled on the vector space
h 1(n, r), we can regard x  x as an element of h 1(n, r). now z = [] in
h1(n, z) and  = [d] in h2(m, n; z), and  = d. thus z = , where
 : h2(m; n, z)  h1(n, z) is the boundary map. using this it is easy to
show that

(8)

where  is the natural pairing between h1(n, z) or h1(n, r) and h 1(n, r).
here is a conjecture on the behaviour of special lagrangian deformations
of n.

conjecture 4.1 suppose n  is close to n in m, and dene t by f(n ) =
3) in u such that n  is
t. then there are holomorphic coordinates (z
close to the 3-fold l+
2, z
3).
the new coordinates (z
3) are close to the old coordinates (z1, z2, z3),
and dier from them by a small translation and a rotation in su(3) close to
the identity.

in particular, as l+

1,t is only well-dened when t  0 and nonsingular
when t > 0, we conjecture that f(n ) > 0 for all nonsingular n  near n
in m, and on the boundary f(n ) = 0, the 3-folds n  have a singular point
modelled locally on l+
0 .

i have stated this as a conjecture because i have not yet proved it. how-
ever, i am condent it is true, and i can see the outlines of a proof using
analytic methods. i am beginning work on the proof of this conjecture (and
similar results) in collaboration with my student, stephen marshall. the
basic idea behind the conjecture is if n is locally modelled on l+
1,t then every
nearby n  in m should be locally modelled on some l+
1,t for some t > 0.

17

but we can nd t explicitly using relative homology, and this is the purpose
of the function f.

we now work out some of the consequences of conjecture 4.1. it turns
out that these are rather dierent when r 6= 0 and when r = 0, so we
consider the two cases separately.

4.1 the case r 6= 0
we have h1(n, r) = h 1(n, r) as n is a compact manifold. thus, as r 6= 0
in h1(n, r), we see that h1(n, r) and h 1(n, r) are both nonzero vector
spaces. furthermore, as the function f : am,n  r satises f(x)f(x) =
r  (x  x) by (8), regarding x  x as an element of h 1(n, r), we see that
f is not constant on am,n .
therefore {x  am,n : f(x) = 0} is a real hyperplane in am,n , which
divides am,n into two halves, the upper half-plane f > 0, and the lower
half-plane f < 0. according to conjecture 4.1, near n the moduli space m
of special lagrangian deformations of n lies solely in the upper half-plane
f > 0. at the dividing wall f = 0 they become singular, with a t 2-cone
singularity modelled on l+
0 , where a circle in n has been crushed to a point.
it is important to note that these singularities happen in real codimension
one in the moduli space m of special lagrangian 3-folds in m, and therefore
that m should be thought of as a manifold with boundary, where the interior
of m corresponds to nonsingular 3-folds, and the boundary to singular 3-
folds. moreover, the singularities develop in a very orderly and predictable
way, on a real hyperplane in am,n .

this is very dierent to the case of special lagrangian submanifolds of
dimension 2, which are essentially holomorphic curves w.r.t. another com-
plex structure. here singularities develop in real codimension two (that is,
complex codimension one) in the moduli space of special lagrangian 2-folds.
thus, a generic path in the moduli space meets only nonsingular 2-folds. this
means that for many purposes we can ignore the singularities, and treat the
moduli space of special lagrangian 2-folds as a manifold without boundary.
however, for special lagrangian 3-folds, these singularities in real codi-
mension one cannot be ignored or perturbed away. this suggests that special
lagrangian 3-folds should have weaker existence and compactness properties
than special lagrangian 2-folds.

18

4.2 the case r = 0
by (8), if r = 0 and n   m then f(n) f(n ) = r  (x x) = 0. thus
f(n ) = f(n) for all n   m, and f is constant on am,n , with value t.
so f > 0 on all of am,n , and the inequality f > 0 does not constrain the
moduli space m in am,n in this case. also conjecture 4.1 (if true) implies
that all n  close to n in m are locally modelled on l+
1,t, for the same value
of t.

let  : h1(n, z)  h1(n, r) be the natural projection. then (z) =
r = 0, and z  ker . but ker  is the subgroup of elements of h1(n, z)
with nite order (the torsion subgroup). thus z has nite order, that is,
k = 0 in h1(n, z) for some positive integer k. since  = [], this means
that we can nd an immersed surface  in n with boundary k.

therefore kd   is a 2-chain in m without boundary, and denes a

homology class  in h2(m, z). moreover

[]   = kzd

 z

 = k f(n),

(9)

since f(n) = rd , and |  0, as   n and |n = 0. here [] 
h 2(m, r), and  is the natural pairing between h 2(m, r) and h2(m, z).
observe that []   > 0 as k > 0 and f(n) > 0, so  6= 0 in h2(m, z).
now consider what happens if we deform the underlying calabi-yau man-
ifold (m, j, g), in a way that changes the cohomology class []  h 2(m, r).
choose a smooth 1-parameter family of calabi-yau metrics gs on m for
s  (, ), with associated complex structures js, kahler forms s and
holomorphic volume forms s, such that g0 = g, j0 = j and 0 = .
we wish to nd a smooth family of 3-folds ns in m for s  (, ) such
that ns is special lagrangian with respect to (m, js, gs), and n0 = n. by
theorem 2.14, ns exists for small s if and only if [s|n ] = 0 in h 2(n, r).
assume that this is so. let ms be the moduli space of special lagrangian
deformations of ns. then we can dene the function f on ms as before.
from (9) we deduce that

f(n 

s) =

1
k

[s]   for all n 

s  ms.

therefore, by conjecture 4.1 (if true), we expect that near n, each n 
ms should be locally modelled on l+

s in
1,t, for t > 0 satisfying k t = [s]  .

19

thus we expect that the family ms of nonsingular special lagrangian
3-folds exists near n only when [s]  > 0. when [s]  = 0, every element
of ms has a singular point modelled on l+
0 . when [s]   < 0, there are no
special lagrangian 3-folds locally isotopic to n, and so ms is empty.
so we have the picture that as we deform the kahler class [] of the
underlying calabi-yau 3-fold (m, j, g) through the real hyperplane [] = 0
in the kahler cone, every special lagrangian 3-fold in m simultaneously
develops a t 2-cone singularity, at least near n. on the other side [] 
 < 0 of the real hyperplane, the special lagrangian 3-folds no longer exist.
we can think of this process as being like a bubble bursting: the 3-fold
suddenly becomes singular, and then disappears. thus special lagrangian 3-
folds should not be thought of as particularly stable under large deformations
of the calabi-yau 3-fold.

4.3

interpretation in terms of
relative gromov invariants

the gromov invariants of a symplectic manifold (m, ) count the pseudo-
holomorphic curves in m w.r.t. an almost complex structure j tamed by ,
satisfying certain homological conditions. they were introduced by gromov
[3], who proved the basic existence and compactness theorems for pseudo-
holomorphic curves. the gromov-witten invariants and quantum cohomol-
ogy are closely-related ideas. an introduction to this subject may be found
in mcdu and salamon [11].

if m is a symplectic manifold and n a lagrangian submanifold, then we
can consider pseudo-holomorphic curves in m with boundary in n. gromov
shows [3, 0.4] that such curves have the same string existence and compact-
ness properties as pseudo-holomorphic curves without boundary. thus it is
natural to try and dene relative gromov invariants of the pair (m, n) by
counting pseudo-holomorphic curves in m with boundary in n, satisfying
homological conditions. this idea is used by oh [14, 10] to dene relative
quantum cohomology.
1,t in u, and we chose a disc d
in m with boundary in n close to the disc d1,t in c3 with boundary in l+
1,t.
but d1,t is in fact holomorphic. as holomorphic curves with boundary in
lagrangian submanifolds are stable under small perturbations, we should be
able to choose d to be a holomorphic disc, and this choice should be unique.

now we assumed above that n is close to l+

20

thus we expect there to exist a holomorphic curve d in m, with bound-
ary in n, such that [d] =   h2(m; n, z). so the relative gromov in-
variant counting holomorphic curves with relative homology class  should
be nonzero, provided there are no other holomorphic curves with relative
homology class . if there were other such curves we would have to consider
the possibility that the total number, counted with signs, is zero; and then
under deformations the holomorphic curves might all cancel out in pairs, to
leave none.

let us assume for the moment that such a relative gromov invariant is
well-dened and nonzero, and is invariant under deformations of n through
nonsingular immersed lagrangian submanifolds. if this is so, then we expect
that for any nonsingular special lagrangian deformation n  of n (and not
just for n  close to n) there should exist a holomorphic curve  with bound-
ary in n  and [] = , under the identication h2(m; n , z) = h2(m; n, z).
but by calibrated geometry the area of  is  f(n ), and clearly the
area of a holomorphic curve must be positive. so we make the following
conjecture, which strengthens part of conjecture 4.1.

conjecture 4.2 suppose that d is the only holomorphic curve in the rela-
tive homology class . let r 6= 0, and let m be the connected component
containing n of the moduli space of nonsingular special lagrangian 3-folds
in m. then f > 0 holds globally on m, and not just near n. similarly,
when r = 0 the entire moduli space m becomes singular when f = 0, and
not just the part near n.

the idea here is that holomorphic curves  with boundary on a special
lagrangian 3-fold n can act as a global obstruction to deforming n, because
the area of  must remain positive. as the area of  tends to zero the 3-fold n
becomes singular, because the boundary of  (presumably a circle) shrinks to
a point. when r 6= 0 these singularities develop on a real hyperplane f = 0
in am,n , so the moduli space is conned to the upper half-plane f > 0.

remark. holomorphic curves with boundary on special lagrangian 3-folds
are familiar to string theorists as world sheet instantons. that is, they are
imagined to be the world sheet (in euclidean time) of an open string moving
in m, with its end-points on n.

for example, strominger, yau and zaslow [17, 2] explain that the leading
order expression [17, eqn (2.10)] they derive for the mirror metric receives
corrections due to open string disc instantons  holomorphic discs whose

21

boundaries are nontrivial 1-cycles in n. these corrections are of order ea,
where a is the area of the disc and  > 0 is large, and so the corrections are
only signicant when the discs have small area.

thus string theorists already know that holomorphic discs with bound-
ary on special lagrangian 3-folds are important, and that things go wrong
when the area of the discs approaches zero. this ts very neatly with the
picture we have outlined above.

let (m, j, g) be a calabi-yau 3-fold, and n1 a compact special lagrangian
3-fold in m. suppose, as in 4, that n1 is locally modelled on l+
1,t1 in c3 in
some open set u in m, for t1 > 0. now in 2 we wrote down three distinct
families l+
j,t for j = 1, 2, 3, of special lagrangian 3-folds in c3 asymptotic to
the same t 2-cone l+
0 . in this section we shall consider whether there also
exist special lagrangian 3-folds n2, n3 in m, which are close to n1 outside
u, but in u are modelled on l+
3,t3 respectively, for some t2, t3 > 0.
we begin by describing how the 3-manifolds n1, n2, n3 are related topo-
logically. recall that u is isomorphic to an open ball in c3 of radius , and
let u be its closure. dene p = n1 \ u, q1 = n1  u and t = p  q1. then
t is a 2-torus t 2, isomorphic to the intersection of l+
1,t1 with the sphere s5
of radius  in c3. it is convenient to identify t with the 2-torus
z1z2z3 = 3(cid:9),

(10)
0 with the sphere s5 of radius . this is close
then p and q1 are both 3-manifolds with common boundary t . also,
q1 has the topology of a solid torus s1  d2, where d2 is the closed disc
in r2. as 3-manifolds we may write n2 = p t q2 and n3 = p t q3,
where q2 and q3 are solid tori with boundary t . that is, we make n2, n3
by cutting out the solid torus q1 from n1, and then gluing in two other solid
tori q2, q3 with the same boundary. now qj is constructed from lj,tj for
j = 1, 2, 3, and cyclic permutation of z1, z2, z3 permutes the families lj,t in
the obvious way. we use this to relate the solid tori q1, q2 and q3.

1,t1 with s5, as t1  2 by assumption.

consider the map  : t  t given by  : (z1, z2, z3) 7 (z3, z1, z2), where
t is given by (10). then  is a dieomorphism of t , with  3 = 1. we can

22

think of q2, q3 as diering from q1 by automorphisms  ,  2 of the boundary
torus t . so we make n2 or n3 by cutting out the solid torus q1, and then
gluing it back in again using the dieomorphism  or  2 to identify the cut
surfaces. this is called a dehn twist.
by assumption, qj is close to l+

j,tj in c3 for j = 1, 2, 3. so, as in 4, let
j be an oriented s1 in qj close to j,tj , and dj an oriented disc in u close to
j be the homology class of j in h1(nj, z), and
dj,tj , with boundary j. let z
r
j the homology class of j in h1(nj, r). let j be the relative homology
class of dj in h2(m; nj, z). then qj contracts onto the circle j, and so
h1(qj, z) = z, and z

j = [j] is a generator of h1(qj, z).

in the next three propositions we consider the topology of n1, n2 and n3.

proposition 5.1 the inclusion  : t  p induces a map  : h1(t, z) 
h1(p, z), which has ker() = z. let  be a generator for ker(). dene
integers k1, k2, k3 by j() = kj[j], where j
: h1(t, z)  h1(qj, z) is
induced by the inclusion t  qj. then k1 + k2 + k3 = 0, and no more than
one of k1, k2, k3 is zero.

proof. as h1(t, z) = z2 and ker() is a subgroup of h1(t, z), we see that
ker() is isomorphic to 0, z or z2. but using poincare duality ideas for
manifolds with boundary, we can show that the map h1(t, r)  h1(p, r)
must have image and kernel r, and this forces ker() = z.
from above, q2 diers from q1 by the automorphism  of its boundary t .
this means that 1 : h1(t, z)  h1(q1, z) and 2 : h1(t, z)  h1(q2, z)
are related by 2 = 1  , where  : h1(t, z)  h1(t, z) is induced
by  , and we identify h1(q1, z) and h1(q2, z) with z in the obvious way.
similarly, 1 : h1(t, z)  h1(q1, z) and 3 : h1(t, z)  h1(q3, z) are
related by 3 = 1   2
 .
 ) = k3[1] by denition of
k1, k2 and k3. thus

so 1() = k1[1], 1() = k2[1] and 1( 2

1(cid:0) +  +  2

 (cid:1) = (k1 + k2 + k3)[1].

(11)

as  3 = 1 we can think of  as a 120 rotation on h1(t, z), and thus
1 +  +  2
  = 0,
and so k1 + k2 + k3 = 0 by (11).

 = 0, as a map from h1(t, z) to itself. therefore  +  +  2

as  6= 0, we see that  and () are linearly independent in h1(t, z).
but 1 : h1(t, z)  h1(q1, z) has kernel z, so  and () cannot both be

23

in ker 1. therefore k1 and k2 cannot both be zero. but if two of k1, k2, k3
are zero then so is the third, as k1 + k2 + k3 = 0. thus no more than one of
k1, k2, k3 can be zero.

proposition 5.2 there exists   h2(m, z) with the following properties
for j = 1, 2, 3.

(i) if kj = 0 then r
j
3-fold if []   = 0.

6= 0, and nj only exists as a special lagrangian

(ii) if kj 6= 0 then r

j = 0, and z

j has order |kj| in h1(nj, z). if nj exists
as a special lagrangian 3-fold locally modelled on l+
j,tj , then tj satises
[]   = kjtj. in particular, as we need tj > 0, this means that nj
only exists if either kj > 0 and []   > 0, or kj < 0 and []   < 0.

proof. the class  in h1(t, z) is homologous to 0 in p , by denition. so
there exists a 2-chain  in p with boundary in t , and [] = . but  is
homologous to kj[j] in qj, as j() = kj[j]. thus we can nd a 2-chain j
in nj with j = kjj, such that j agrees with  in p for j = 1, 2, 3. thus
kjdj  j is a 2-chain in m without boundary, as j = dj, and denes
a homology class  in h2(m, z). this  is independent of j, as the chains
kjdj  j coincide outside the open ball u for j = 1, 2, 3.
we have

suppose nj is indeed a special lagrangian 3-fold modelled on l+

j,tj . then

[]   = zkjdj

 zj

 = kj zdj

  kjtj,

  rdj,tj

since rdj
0 = tj as dj,  are close to dj,t, 0 in u, and |j  0
because j  nj and |nj  0. as we are free to change tj a little bit, we
can take []   = kjtj.
now suppose that nj is homologous to zero in nj for some n  z. then
there exists a 2-chain c in nj with c = nj. by choosing c generically we
can arrange that c  t is a 1-chain in t . let  = [c  t ] in h1(t, z). as
c  t = (c  p ) it follows that () = 0, where  : h1(t, z)  h1(p, z)
is the natural projection.
but ker  is generated by , so  = l  for some l  z. also qj  c is
a homology between c  t and nj, and thus j() = n[j]. substituting

24

thus in part (i), if kj = 0 then z

j = [j].

 = l  and j() = kj[j] gives n = l kj. conversely, if n = l kj then nj
is homologous to zero in nj. therefore nz
j = 0 in h1(nj, z) if and only if
n = l kj for some l  z, as z
j has innite order in h1(nj, z), and
therefore r
j 6= 0. if nj exists as a special lagrangian 3-fold then []   =
kjtj from above, and so []   = 0. similarly, in part (ii) if kj 6= 0 then
nz
j has order |kj|. also
if nj exists as a special lagrangian 3-fold then []   = kjtj, and the rest
of (ii) immediately follows.

j = 0 if and only if n = l kj for l  z implies that z

proposition 5.3 in the situation above b1(p )  1 and b1(p )1  b1(nj) 
b1(p ), so b1(nj) = 0 for any j only if b1(p ) = 1. suppose b1(p ) = 1. then
h1(p ; t, z) is nite, and for j = 1, 2, 3 we have

(i) if kj = 0 then b1(nj) = 1, and h1(nj, z) is innite.

(ii) if kj 6= 0 then b1(nj) = 0, so that nj is a (rational) homology sphere,

and h1(nj, z) is nite with (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(nj, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) = |kj| (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(p ; t, z)(cid:12)(cid:12).

proof. we argued in the proof of proposition 5.1 that the map h1(t, r) 
h1(p, r) has image r. hence h1(p, r) contains a copy of r, and b1(p )  1.
the exact sequence h1(t, r)  h1(p, r)  h1(p ; t, r)  0 then shows
that dim h1(p ; t, r) = b1(p )  1. but h1(p ; t, r) = h1(nj; qj, r) by
excision.
thus in the exact sequence h1(qj, r)  h1(nj, r)  h1(nj; qj, r)  0
we have dim h1(qj, r) = 1 and dim h1(nj; qj, r) = b1(p )  1. the image
j . therefore b1(nj) = b1(p ) if
of h1(qj, r)  h1(nj, r) is generated by r
j = 0. thus b1(p )  1  b1(nj)  b1(p ),
j 6= 0, and b1(nj) = b1(p )  1 if r
r
as we want.
now suppose b1(p ) = 1. then dim h1(p ; t, r) = 0 from above, and
j 6= 0 by
thus h1(p ; t, z) is nite, as we have to prove. if kj = 0 then r
proposition 5.2, and so b1(nj) = b1(p ) = 1, which implies that h1(nj, z)
j = 0 by
is innite. this proves part (i). for part (ii), if kj 6= 0 then r
proposition 5.2, so b1(nj) = b1(p )  1 = 0. this implies that h1(nj, z)
is nite, and as nj is also connected and oriented, that nj is a rational
homology 3-sphere.

25

it remains to show that (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(nj, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) = |kj|  (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(p ; t, z)(cid:12)(cid:12). consider the

exact sequence

h1(qj, z)  h1(nj, z)  h1(nj; qj, z)  0.

(12)

here h1(qj, z) is isomorphic to z and is generated by [j]. but the image of
[j] in h1(nj, z) is z
j, which has nite order |kj| in h1(nj, z) by proposition
5.2. thus the image of h1(qj, z) in h1(nj, z) is z|kj|, the nite cyclic
group of order |kj|.
it follows from this, the exact sequence (12) and the
excision isomorphism h1(nj; qj, z) = h1(p ; t, z) that (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(nj, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) = |kj| 
(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(p ; t, z)(cid:12)(cid:12), and the proof is complete.
we can now draw some conclusions about the behaviour of families of
special lagrangian 3-folds. as in 4, we consider the cases r 6= 0 and
r = 0 separately.

write n1 = n. then in the notation of this section we have r

5.1 the case r 6= 0
suppose, as in 4.1, that n is a special lagrangian 3-fold in m modelled
locally on l+
1,t with r 6= 0, which is part of a family m of special lagrangian
3-folds. then we expect m to be contained in the upper half-plane f > 0
in am,n , and that at the boundary f = 0 the special lagrangian 3-folds in
m develop singularities locally modelled on the t 2-cone l+
0 .
1 6= 0,
so k1 = 0 and []   = 0 by part (i) of proposition 5.2. but only one of
k1, k2, k3 can be zero by proposition 5.1, and so k2 6= 0 and k3 6= 0. so by
part (ii) of proposition 5.2 we see that n2 and n3 do not exist as special
lagrangian 3-folds, as this would require []   > 0 or []   < 0, but we
know that []   = 0.
let n0 be a singular special lagrangian 3-fold at the boundary f = 0 of
m, and suppose n0 has only one singular point, which is modelled locally on
l+
0 . then there is a family m of nonsingular special lagrangian 3-folds n1
converging to n0, locally modelled on l+
1,t1. however, we have shown that
there do not exist other families of special lagrangian 3-folds n2, n3 in m
converging to n0, locally modelled on l+
3,t3. this is not obvious,
but depends on the assumption that n is a compact nonsingular 3-manifold.
in fact we can take this argument further. let us assume that any family
of nonsingular special lagrangian 3-folds in m converging to n0 must be
locally modelled on ac special lagrangian 3-folds in c3 asymptotic to l+
0 .

2,t2 and l+

26

j,tj . we have ruled out families modelled on l+

but we showed in 3 that any ac special lagrangian 3-fold asymptotic to
l+
0 is one of the l+
3,t3.
so, provided our assumption is correct, we deduce that m is the only family
of nonsingular special lagrangian 3-folds in m converging to n0.
this is something which should be taken into account in discussions about
compactifying moduli spaces of special lagrangian 3-folds, or brations of
calabi-yau 3-folds by special lagrangian 3-folds, as suggested by strominger,
yau and zaslow [17]. we have shown (provided our assumptions are correct)
that families of special lagrangian 3-folds can develop singularities in codi-
mension one, which cannot be repaired any other way.

2,t2 and l+

that is, moduli spaces m of special lagrangian 3-folds should be ex-
pected to be manifolds with boundary, and it is too much to hope that in
general singularities will develop only in codimension two in m. neverthe-
less, the author is at the moment quite optimistic that special lagrangian
3-folds will turn out to have quite good compactness properties, and that
the ideas of strominger, yau and zaslow will turn out to be correct near the
large complex structure limit.

5.2 the case r = 0

suppose that n is a special lagrangian 3-fold in m modelled locally on l+
1,t
with r = 0. as in 4.2 we have []   = kf(n) = kt > 0. moreover, if
n  is close to n in the moduli space m of special lagrangian deformations
of n, then we expect n  also to be locally modelled on l+
1,t, with the same
value of t.

write n1 = n and t1 = t, and use the notation of this section. consider,
as above, whether there exist special lagrangian 3-folds n2, n3 which are
close to n1 outside u, but inside u are locally modelled on l+
3,t3 for
some t2, t3 > 0. as []   > 0, proposition 5.2 shows that nj can only exist
if kj > 0. but k1 + k2 + k3 = 0 by proposition 5.1, and k1 = k by denition,
so k1 > 0. thus at least one of k2 and k3 are less than zero, and so at most
one of n2, n3 exists as a special lagrangian 3-fold.

2,t2 and l+

now deform the underlying calabi-yau 3-fold (m, j, g), changing the co-
homology class [] of , so that []   passes through zero. then, when
[]   < 0, proposition 5.2 shows that nj exists only if kj < 0. in fact we
conjecture that under suciently small deformations of (m, j, g), the condi-
tions kj > 0 when []   > 0 and kj < 0 when []   < 0 are also sucient
conditions for nj to exist as a special lagrangian 3-fold.

27

in particular, we have the following three cases.

(a) suppose k1, k2 > 0 and k3 < 0. when []  > 0 we expect that n1, n2
exist as special lagrangian 3-folds but n3 does not, but when [] < 0
then n3 exists as a special lagrangian 3-fold but n1, n2 do not.

(b) suppose k1 > 0, k2 = 0 and k3 < 0. when []   > 0 we expect that
n1 exists as a special lagrangian 3-fold but n2, n3 do not, but when
[]   < 0 then n3 exists as a special lagrangian 3-fold but n1, n2 do
not.

(c) suppose k1 > 0 and k2, k3 < 0. when []   > 0 we expect that
n1 exists as a special lagrangian 3-fold but n2, n3 do not, but when
[]   < 0 then n2, n3 exist as special lagrangian 3-folds but n1 does
not.

let us now restrict our attention to the case that b1(n1) = 0, that is,
n1 is a (rational) homology 3-sphere. then by proposition 5.3, nj
is a
homology 3-sphere if and only if kj 6= 0. also, by corollary 2.15, if nj is a
homology 3-sphere then it is rigid as a special lagrangian 3-fold, and has no
deformations.

cases (a)(c) above show us that as we deform (m, j, g), changing the co-
homology class [] of , then (if our assumptions are correct) it can happen
that two special lagrangian homology 3-spheres disappear, and one reap-
pears; or that one disappears, and another reappears; or that one disappears,
and two reappear. in particular, this shows that the number of special la-
grangian homology 3-spheres in m is not invariant under deformations of
(m, j, g) changing the kahler class [], even if counted with signs.

6 a second family of special lagrangian

3-folds in c3

most of the material in this section is not original; it is taken from harvey
and lawson [7, iii.3.b], lawlor [10] and harvey [6, p. 139140]. we begin
with a proposition adapted from harvey and lawson [7, iii.3.b].

28

proposition 6.1 let c  r, and dene a submanifold kc in c3 by
3 = 1

kc = n(zx1, zx2, zx3)  c3 : x1, x2, x3  r with x2

2 + x2
1 + x2
and z  c with im(z3) = co.

(13)

then kc is a special lagrangian 3-fold in c3.

these submanifolds are clearly invariant under the obvious action of

so(3) on c3, and this is how harvey and lawson constructed them.

let c > 0, and consider the equation im(z3) = c. writing z = rei gives
r3 sin 3 = c. so sin 3 > 0, which holds when  lies in (0, /3) or (2/3, )
or (4/3, 5/3), and then r is given explicitly by r = c1/3(sin 3)1/3. thus
im(z3) = c denes a curve in c with 3 connected components. so kc also di-
vides into 3 connected components k12,c, k13,c and k23,c, each dieomorphic
to s2  r, given explicitly by

k12,c = n(zx1,zx2, zx3)  c3 : (x1, x2, x3)  s2 and z = rei
with   (0, /3) and r = c1/3(sin 3)1/3(cid:9),
k13,c = n(zx1,zx2, zx3)  c3 : (x1, x2, x3)  s2 and z = rei
with   (2/3, ) and r = c1/3(sin 3)1/3(cid:9),
k23,c = n(zx1,zx2, zx3)  c3 : (x1, x2, x3)  s2 and z = rei

with   (4/3, 5/3) and r = c1/3(sin 3)1/3(cid:9).

(14)

(15)

(16)

observe that kc = kc, as if we simultaneously reverse the signs of z, x1, x2
and x3 then (zx1, zx2, zx3) is unchanged, but im(z3) changes to  im(z3).
thus kc is also dieomorphic to 3 copies of s2  r when c < 0.
however, k0 is the (singular) union of the three special lagrangian 3-
planes

1 = (cid:8)(x1, x2, x3) : xj  r(cid:9), 2 = (cid:8)(ei/3x1, ei/3x2, ei/3x3) : xj  r(cid:9)

and 3 = (cid:8)(e2i/3x1, e2i/3x2, e2i/3x3) : xj  r(cid:9).

(17)

it is not dicult to show that each kjk,c dened in (14)(16) is asymptotically
conical, and asymptotic at innity to the union of two of 1, 2, 3. we have

29

chosen our notation such that kjk,c is asymptotic to jk, which is a special
lagrangian cone on 2 copies of s2.
thus we have found a 1-parameter family {l12,c : c > 0} of special la-
grangian 3-folds dieomorphic to s2  r, which are asymptotic at innity to
the union of the two special lagrangian 3-planes 1 and 2. it is natural to
ask whether we can nd a similar family of special lagrangian 3-folds asymp-
totic to the union of any two special lagrangian 3-planes ,  intersecting
at 0. to answer this we rst classify such pairs of 3-planes up to the action
of su(3).

proposition 6.2 let ,  be special lagrangian 3-planes in c3 which in-
tersect only at 0. then there exist 1, 2, 3  (0, ) and a  su(3) such
that

a   = (cid:8)(x1, x2, x3) : xj  r(cid:9), a   = (cid:8)(ei1x1, ei2x2, ei3x3) : xj  r(cid:9).
furthermore 1 + 2 + 3 =  if the intersection    is positive, and
1 + 2 + 3 = 2 if the intersection    is negative.

we leave the proof as an exercise. here we mean that the intersection
   is positive or negative in the sense of homology; note that as the
dimension is odd,    has the opposite sign to   , so we can arrange
for    to be positive by swapping round  and .
next we dene a family of special lagrangian 3-folds k,a which gener-
alizes the family k12,c given in (14). this family was rst found by lawlor
[10], and made more explicit by harvey [6, p. 139140]. our treatment is
based on that of harvey.

let a1, a2, a3 > 0, and dene polynomials p(x), p (x) by

p(x) = (1 + a1x2)(1 + a2x2)(1 + a3x2)  1 and p (x) =

p(x)
x2 .

dene real numbers 1, 2, 3 and a by

k = akz 



and a =

clearly k > 0 and a > 0. but writing 1 + 2 + 3 as one integral and

making the substitution w = pp(x). so k  (0, ) and 1 + 2 + 3 = . it
can be shown that this yields a 1-1 correspondence between triples (a1, a2, a3)
with ak > 0, and quadruples (1, 2, 3, a) with k  (0, ), 1 + 2 + 3 = 
and a > 0.

for k = 1, 2, 3 and y  r, dene zk(y) by zk(y) = eik(y)qa1

dx

.

(1 + akx2)pp (x)

now write  = (1, 2, 3), and dene a submanifold k,a in c3 by
k,a = (cid:8)(z1(y)x1, z2(y)x2, z3(y)x3) : y  r, xk  r, x2

1 + x2

2 + x2

3 = 1(cid:9).

(18)

the following proposition may be deduced from harvey [6, th. 7.78].

proposition 6.3 the set k,a dened above is an embedded special la-
grangian submanifold in c3 dieomorphic to s2  r. it is asymptotically
conical, and asymptotic at innity to the union 1   of two special la-
grangian 3-planes 1,  given by

1 = (cid:8)(x1, x2, x3) : xj  r(cid:9) and  = (cid:8)(ei1x1, ei2x2, ei3x3) : xj  r(cid:9).

(19)

it can be shown that when 1 = 2 = 3 = /3 and a = 4c/3, the
submanifolds k12,c and k,a dened by (14) and (18) agree. thus the k,a
do generalize the k12,c. combining propositions 6.2 and 6.3 we prove:

corollary 6.4 let ,  be any two special lagrangian 3-planes in c3 inter-
secting only at 0. then there exists a 1-parameter family {k,,a : a > 0}
of ac special lagrangian 3-folds, which are all dieomorphic to s2  r, and
asymptotic to    at innity.

finally we interpret the constant a in k,a. using the above notation,

dene

d,a = (cid:8)(x1ei1/2, x2ei2/2, x3ei3/2) : xk  r, a1x2

1 + a2x2

2 + a3x2

3  1(cid:9).

(20)

31

then d,a is a solid ellipsoid in c3, with boundary in k,a. the axes of
d,a have lengths a1/2
for k = 1, 2, 3, and so the volume of d,a is a. fur-
thermore, d,a is calibrated with respect to im(0). that is, we can regard
d,a as a special lagrangian 3-fold of phase ei/2, whereas k,a has phase
1; so that d,a and k,a are both special lagrangian, but of perpendicular
phase.

k

we met a very similar situation in 3. there we dened a special la-
grangian 3-fold l+
j,t depending on a real parameter t > 0, and a holomorphic
2-disc dj,t with boundary on l+
j,t, and area t. here we dene a special
lagrangian 3-fold k,a depending on a real parameter a > 0, and a special
lagrangian 3-disc d,a of perpendicular phase, with boundary on k,a and
area a.

suppose k is an ac special lagrangian 3-fold asymptotic to the cone
1  2, where 1, 2 are given in (17). as 1  2 is invariant under the
obvious action of so(3) on c3, it follows from proposition 2.9 that k is also
so(3)-invariant. but it is not dicult to show that any connected, so(3)-
invariant special lagrangian 3-fold is an open subset of one of the 3-folds kc
of (13). thus k must be k12,c for some c > 0.

we have shown that any ac special lagrangian 3-fold asymptotic to
1  2 is one of the 3-folds k12,c dened in (14). but the 3-folds k,a are
generalizations of the k12,c, asymptotic to 1  . the author conjectures
that any ac special lagrangian 3-fold asymptotic to 1   is one of the
3-folds k,a dened in (18), for some a > 0.

7 another degeneration of

special lagrangian 3-folds

we now consider families of compact special lagrangian 3-folds n in a
calabi-yau 3-fold (m, j, g) which are locally modelled on the 3-folds k,a
dened in 6. the picture we discover is similar to that in 4.
let (m, j, g) be a calabi-yau 3-fold with kahler form , let  be a holo-
morphic 3-form on m, and n a compact, embedded special lagrangian 3-fold
in m with phase ei. by replacing  by ei we may suppose that n has
phase 1. suppose that there exist a small open ball u in m, holomorphic co-
ordinates (z1, z2, z3) on u, and a small constant  > 0 satisfying the following
conditions:

32

is, u is the open ball of radius  about 0 in c3.

 in coordinates u = (cid:8)(z1, z2, z3)  c3 : |z1|2 + |z2|2 + |z3|2 < 2(cid:9). that
 on u the metric g, kahler form  and 3-form  on m are very close

to the euclidean versions g0, 0, 0 on c3 dened by (3).

 in u, the 3-fold n in m is very close to the 3-fold k,a in c3 dened
by (18), for some 1, 2, 3  (0, ) with 1 + 2 + 3 =  and a with 0 <
a  3.

let d,a be as in (20). since by assumption n is close to k,a in u,
we can choose a closed, oriented 3-disc d in u with boundary in n which
is close to d,a. in fact, because special lagrangian 3-discs with boundary
on n are stable under small deformations, we can choose d to be special
lagrangian with phase ei/2, that is, d is calibrated with respect to im .

let s be the boundary of d. then s is an oriented 2-sphere in n. let
 be the homology class [s] of s in h2(n, z), and  the relative homology
class [d] in h3(m; n, z). because d is close to d,a and  close to 0 on
u, we have

zd

im   zd,a

im 0 = a,

as d,a is calibrated w.r.t. im 0 and has area a. since we are free to change

suppose  is a 3-chain in m with boundary in n, and [] = . as

a by a little bit, let us dene a to be rd im .
im   0 on n, it easily follows that r im  depends only on the relative
homology class [] of  in h3(m; n, z), and so r im  = a, as [] = [d]
and rd im  = a. thus the constant a > 0 is determined by integrating
im  on the relative homology class  in h3(m; n, z). this is similar to the
situation in 4, where t was given by integrating  on  in h2(m; n, z).
now let m be a connected and simply-connected open neighbourhood
of n in the moduli space of special lagrangian 3-folds in m. we explained
in 2.4 why m is isomorphic to an open subset of an ane space a
modelled on h 2(n, r), and how to associate a function f : m  r to each
class   h3(m; n, z). when  = , we have f(n) = a, since [d] = 
and rd im  = a.
let n, n  be special lagrangian 3-folds in m, and x, x the corresponding
m,n is modelled on the vector space

points in the ane space a

m,n

m,n . since a

33

h 2(n, r), we can regard x  x as an element of h 2(n, r). by the same
proof as (8) in 4, we see that

f(n)  f(n ) = f(x)  f(x) =   (x  x)

(21)

where  is the natural pairing between h2(n, z) and h 2(n, r).
here is a conjecture on the behaviour of special lagrangian deformations
of n, analogous to conjecture 4.1. we hope to be able to prove it by the
methods outlined in 4.
conjecture 7.1 suppose n  is close to n in m, and dene a = f(n ).
then there are holomorphic coordinates (z
3  (0, )
3 = , such that n  is close to the 3-fold k,a in c3
with 
dened by (18) in the coordinates (z
3). the
new coordinates (z
3) are close to the old coordinates (z1, z2, z3), and
dier from them by a small translation and a rotation in su(3) close to the
identity.

in particular, as k,a is only well-dened when a  0 and nonsingular
when a > 0, we conjecture that f(n ) > 0 for all nonsingular n  near
n in m, and on the boundary f(n ) = 0, the 3-folds n  have a singular
point modelled locally on the intersection of two special lagrangian 3-planes
1,  in c3.

in 4 we found that things were dierent when r 6= 0 and when r = 0.
here things are dierent when  6= 0 and when  = 0, so we consider the two
cases separately.

7.1 the case  6= 0

m,n  r is not constant on a

as n is compact and oriented and s is an embedded hypersurface in n,
we see that [s] 6= 0 in h2(n, z) implies that [s] 6= 0 in h2(n, r). thus
h2(n, r) and h 2(n, r) are both nonzero vector spaces, and (21) shows that
m,n . therefore {x 
the function f : a
m,n : f(x) = 0} is a real hyperplane in a
a
m,n into
two halves, the upper half-plane f > 0, and the lower half-plane f < 0.
according to conjecture 7.1, near n the moduli space m of special la-
grangian deformations of n lies solely in the upper half-plane f > 0. at
the dividing wall f = 0 they become singular, with a singularity modelled
on the union of two 3-planes 1  , where an s2 in n has been crushed

m,n , which divides a

34

to a point. thus, these singularities happen in real codimension one in m,
as in 4.2.
let n  be one of these singular 3-folds at f = 0, with a singularity
modelled on 1  at p  m. but 1  is nonsingular, as an immersed
submanifold. thus we can regard n  as a nonsingular, immersed special
lagrangian 3-fold in m, but with a dierent topology to n, and a point of
self-intersection at p. that is, n  is the image of an immersion f : n  m,
where n is a compact, connected, nonsingular 3-manifold with b2( n ) =
b2(n)  1.

7.2 the case  = 0
we rst discuss the topology of n. if [s] =  = 0 in h2(n, z) then n \
s splits into two connected components. regard these components as 3-
manifolds with boundary, with orientation induced from n, and let c + be
the component with c + = s and c  the component with c  = s,
viewing c  as 3-chains. then c + corresponds to the part of k,a asymptotic
to the plane 1 in u, and c  to the part of k,a asymptotic to the plane
 in u, where 1,  are given in (19). as d = s we see that c + + d
and c   d are 3-chains without boundary. dene classes  in h3(m, z)
by + = [c + + d] and  = [c   d].
lemma 7.2 these classes  satisfy + +  = [n]  h3(m, z), [im ] 
+ = a = f(n) and [im ]   = a. furthermore the images of  in
h3(m, r) are linearly independent.

proof. the 3-chain equation (c + + d) + (c   d) = n implies that
+ +  = [n]. as im |n  0 and rd im  = a from above, we get
[im ]   = a. now if  were linearly dependent in h3(m, r) then the
equations [im ]   = a and a > 0 would force + +  = 0, and so
[n] = 0. but this contradicts the fact that [re ]  [n] = vol(n) > 0, and
thus the  are linearly independent in h3(m, r).

by (21), if  = 0 and n   m then f(n)  f(n ) =   (x  x) = 0.
thus f(n ) = f(n) = a for all n   m, and f is constant on a
m,n ,
with value a. so conjecture 7.1 (if true) implies that all n  close to n in
m are locally modelled on k,a, where  can vary but a > 0 is xed.
now consider what happens if we deform the underlying calabi-yau man-
ifold (m, j, g), in a way that changes the cohomology class []  h 3(m, c).

35

choose a smooth 1-parameter family of calabi-yau metrics gs on m for
s  (, ), with associated complex structures js, kahler forms s and
holomorphic volume forms s, such that g0 = g, j0 = j and 0 = . fix
the phase of s by requiring that [im s]  [n] = 0 for all s  (, ).
we wish to nd a smooth family of 3-folds ns in m for s  (, ) such
that ns is special lagrangian with respect to (m, js, gs), and n0 = n. by
theorem 2.14, ns exists for small s if and only if [s|n ] = 0 in h 2(n, r).
assume that this is so. let ms be the moduli space of special lagrangian
deformations of ns. then we can dene the function f on ms as before.
as f(n) = [im ] + by lemma 7.2, we deduce that f(n 
s) = [im s] +
s  ms. thus conjecture 7.1 (if true) implies that near n, each n 
for all n 
in ms should be locally modelled on k,a, where a = [im s]  +.
thus we expect that the family ms of nonsingular special lagrangian 3-
folds exists near n only when [im s] + > 0. when [im s] + = 0, every
element of ms near n has a singular point modelled on the intersection of
two special lagrangian 3-planes. when [im s] + < 0, there are no special
lagrangian 3-folds locally isotopic to n, and ms is empty. as in 4.2, we
have found a way for special lagrangian 3-folds to become singular, and then
disappear, under deformation.

choose t  (, ) with [im t]+ = 0, and let nt be in mt near n. then
nt should have one singular point at p  m, with singularity modelled on
the union 1   of two special lagrangian 3-planes in c3. it is easy to see
that nt is actually the union of two nonsingular compact special lagrangian
3-folds n +
t , which intersect at p. as a 3-manifold n is the connected
t , which implies that b1(n) = b1(n +

to be the component of nt close to c +, and n

in (m, jt, gt) are
stable under small deformations (m, js, gs) of the underlying calabi-yau 3-

that [s|n +

s be the moduli space of special lagrangian deforma-
in (m, js, gs). in particular, when s = 0 we have (m, j0, g0) =

(m, js, gs), and let m
tions of n

(m, j, g), and so m

let n  be elements of these families m

0 . then n + and n  are compact
nonsingular special lagrangian 3-folds in (m, j, g). thus, in (m, j, g) we
expect not just one family m of special lagrangian 3-folds close to n, but
also two other families m+
0 of special lagrangian 3-folds close to n +
and n .

0 , m

the key to understanding what is going on here is to think about the
phases of n, n + and n . we xed the phase of n to be 1 above. let n 
have volumes v  and phases ei

. then

v +ei+

= []  [n +] = []  + and v ei

= []  [n ] = []  .

(22)

so the phases of n  are determined by the cohomology class []. moreover,
as  are linearly independent by lemma 7.2, by varying [] in h 3(m, c)
we can vary the phases of n  independently.

dene b to be the areas of c . then b > 0. since c  are calibrated

w.r.t. re  and d is calibrated w.r.t. im , we have

zc +

 = b+,

zc

 = b and

zd

 = ia.

as + = [c + + d] and  = [c   d], this shows that []   = b  ia.
so (22) gives

v +ei+

= b+ + ia and v ei

= b  ia.

(23)

as v , b and a are all positive, we see that +  (0, /2) and  
(/2, 0), modulo 2. and since a is assumed small, we see that + is small
and positive, and  is small and negative.
now let us deform the calabi-yau 3-fold in the family (m, js, gs), and
write as = [im s]  +. from above we expect that special lagrangian
deformations of n should exist in (m, js, gs) when as > 0, that they become
singular when as = 0, and that they do not exist when as < 0.

but we expect special lagrangian deformations n 

(m, js, gs) for all small s  (, ). let ei

s be the phases of n 

s of n  to exist in
s . replacing

37

a by as in (23), we see that when as = 0 the phases of n 
s  (/2, 0) and 
coincide, at 1. and when as < 0 we have +
so that +
s is now small and negative, and 
s is small and positive.
to express this more clearly, we make the following denition.

s and ns all
2  (0, /2),

denition 7.3 let (m, j, g) be a calabi-yau 3-fold, and suppose +,  
h3(m, z) are linearly independent in h3(m, r). dene a subset w (+, )
in h 3(m, c) by

w (+, ) = (cid:8)  h 3(m, c) : (  +)(   )  (0,)(cid:9),

where  is the complex conjugate of . that is, + and  are complex
numbers, and their product must be a positive real number for  to lie in
w (+, ). then w (+, ) is a real hypersurface in h 3(m, c), but not a
hyperplane.

fix some small   (0, ). let   h 3(m, c), and write (+)( ) =
rei, where r  0 and   (, ]. then  lies in w (+, ) if r > 0 and
 = 0. we say that  lies on the positive side of w (+, ) if r > 0 and
0 <  < , and that  lies on the negative side of w (+, ) if r > 0 and
 <  < 0. note that w (+, ) = w (, +), but the positive side of
w (+, ) is the negative side of w (, +), and vice versa.

thus we have the following picture. we are given compact, nonsingular
special lagrangian 3-folds n + and n  in m with phases ei+, ei
, which
intersect at one point p  m, such that n +  n  is a positive intersection.
as we deform the underlying calabi-yau 3-fold (m, j, g) so that cohomology
class [] varies in h 3(m, c), the phases ei+, ei

of n + and n  change.

then we believe that when [] is on the positive side of w (+, ), there
should exist a special lagrangian 3-fold n dieomorphic to n +#n , with
[n] = [n +] + [n ] in h3(m, z), and locally modelled on some k,a near the
point of intersection p of n +  n . as we deform [] through w (+, )
this n converges to the singular union n +  n , and on the negative side
of w (+, ) we believe that n does not exist.
thus, as we deform [] through w (+, ), a new special lagrangian 3-
fold n is created or destroyed. this is only a local picture, in a small region
of h 3(m, c) near a point of w (+, ). to extend it to a global picture one
would have to include other hypersurfaces and special lagrangian 3-folds
in other homology classes. also, we would have to consider the fact that
the moduli space of complex 3-folds with holomorphic volume forms is only

38

locally identied with h 3(m, c), and globally it has singularities on complex
hypersurfaces, with monodromy around them.

8 counting special lagrangian

homology 3-spheres

it is now well known that one can dene important invariants of symplectic
manifolds by counting (with signs) the pseudo-holomorphic curves satisfying
certain homological conditions. this idea was rst introduced by gromov
[3], who proved the basic existence and compactness properties for pseudo-
holomorphic curves. the invariants were generalized by witten [18] using
ideas from physics, and by ruan and tian [16] in their theory of quantum
cohomology.

a good introduction to the subject is given by mcdu and salamon
[11]. they dene two kinds of invariant of a compact symplectic manifold
[11, ch. 7], gromov invariants and gromov-witten invariants, obtained by
counting pseudo-holomorphic curves in slightly dierent ways. the impor-
tant thing about these invariants is that they are very stable under defor-
mations, both of the choice of metric used to dene them, and also of the
symplectic structure.

now it seems a natural (but perhaps optimistic) question to ask whether
we can dene similar invariants of calabi-yau 3-folds (m, j, g) by counting
special lagrangian 3-folds n in m satisfying suitable homological conditions.
probably the simplest such condition is to count 3-folds n in some xed ho-
mology class in h3(n, z), and we will focus on this. we shall also restrict our
attention to (rational) homology 3-spheres, to get zero-dimensional moduli
spaces.

thus we aim to dene an invariant as follows. let (m, j, g) be a calabi-
yau 3-fold, let   h3(m, z), and let s() be the set of special lagrangian
homology 3-spheres n in m with [n] = . suppose s() is nite, and dene

i() = xn s()

w(n),

(24)

where w is a weight function taking values in a commutative ring r, and
w(n) depends only on the topology of n.
in this way we dene a map
i : h3(m, z)  r, which we consider to be an analogue of the gromov

39

invariant. for this invariant to be interesting, we would like it to be stable
under deformations of the underlying calabi-yau 3-fold (m, j, g), or at least
to change in a predictable way as we make these deformations.

thus we need to know what can happen to special lagrangian homology
3-spheres as we deform (m, j, g), and especially how they can become singu-
lar, appear or disappear. each such transition may change the set of special
lagrangian homology 3-spheres, and thus the invariant i(). for i() to be
invariant or to transform nicely under these transitions, the weight function
w must satisfy some topological identities.

we have already described models for two such transitions in 5 and 7.
we will calculate the conditions on w for i() to be invariant under the change
described in 5, and to transform in a certain simple way under the change
described in 7. it turns out that the weight function w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12)
satises both of these conditions. we also propose a correction to (24) for
multiple covers of special lagrangian homology 3-spheres.
motivated by this, we shall dene an invariant i : h3(m, z)  q and
make a conjecture about its behaviour. we interpret our conjecture in terms
of string theory, and nally we consider what the invariants would tell us if
they work.

invariance of i() under the transitions of 5

8.1
in 5.2 we explained how, as we deform the
we use the notation of 5.
calabi-yau 3-fold (m, j, g), three special lagrangian 3-folds n1, n2, n3 can
converge to the same singular special lagrangian 3-fold n0 with a t 2-cone
singularity. this happens on a hyperplane []   = 0 in the kahler cone,
and nj exists as a nonsingular special lagrangian 3-fold in (m, j, g) if either
kj > 0 and []   > 0, or kj < 0 and []   < 0. it is easy to see that
the condition for the invariant i() given by (24) to be unchanged by this
transition is

xj{1,2,3}:

w(nj) = xj{1,2,3}:

kj >0

kj<0

w(nj).

(25)

now if n is a homology 3-sphere then h1(n, z) is a nite group, so

(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) is a positive integer. take the commutative ring r to be z,
and dene w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12). remarkably, it turns out that this weight

function, perhaps the simplest nontrivial invariant of n there is, satises (25).

40

proposition 8.1 dene an integer-valued invariant w of compact, non-

singular 3-manifolds n by w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) if h1(n, z) is nite, and
w(n) = 0 if h1(n, z) is innite. then (25) holds for all sets of 3-manifolds
n1, n2, n3 constructed as in 5.

proof.
if none of n1, n2 or n3 is a homology 3-sphere then w(nj) = 0 for
j = 1, 2, 3, and (25) holds trivially. so suppose at least one nj is a homology
3-sphere. then proposition 5.3 shows that b1(p ) = 1 and h1(p ; t, z) is
nite, that nj is a homology 3-sphere if and only if kj 6= 0, and that if kj 6= 0
then (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(nj, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) = |kj| (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(p ; t, z)(cid:12)(cid:12).

therefore (25) becomes

xj{1,2,3}:

kj>0

|kj| (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(p ; t, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) = xj{1,2,3}:

kj<0

|kj| (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(p ; t, z)(cid:12)(cid:12).

but this is clearly true, as k1 + k2 + k3 = 0 by proposition 5.1.

8.2 transformation of i() under the transitions of 7
we use the notation of 7. let (m, j, g) be a calabi-yau 3-fold, and n +,
n  compact special lagrangian homology 3-spheres in m, such that n  has
phase ei
and [n ] =   h3(m, z). let w (+, ) be as in denition
7.3. suppose rst that n +, n  intersect transversely at one point p, and
that n +  n  is a positive intersection, so that +   = 1.
then we explained in 7 that as we deform (m, j, g) so that [] passes
through w (+, ) from the negative side to the positive side, we create
a new special lagrangian 3-fold n dieomorphic to n +#n . as n  are
homology 3-spheres, it follows that n is a homology 3-sphere. therefore it
makes a contribution to the invariant i(+ + ), where i is given in (24).
now suppose n +, n  intersect transversely in k+l points, where n +n 
is positive at k points p1, . . . , pk, and negative at l points q1, . . . , ql. then
+   = k  l. on the positive side of w (+, ) we have k distinct
immersed special lagrangian homology 3-spheres dieomorphic to n +#n ,
that is, the connected sum of n + and n  at the points p1, . . . , pk.

for the negative intersections q1, . . . , ql we exchange + and , and
then the role of the positive and negative sides of w (+, ) are reversed.

41

thus, on the negative side of w (+, ) we have l distinct immersed spe-
cial lagrangian homology 3-spheres dieomorphic to n +#n , that is, the
connected sum of n + and n  at q1, . . . , ql. hence, as we pass through the
w (+, ) going from the negative side to the positive side, we simultane-
ously create k immersed special lagrangian copies of n +#n , and destroy
l immersed special lagrangian copies of n +#n .

suppose for simplicity that n  are the only special lagrangian homology
3-spheres in their homology classes . then i(+) = w(n +) and i() =
w(n ). write i(+ + )+ for the value of i(+ + ) at some point on the
positive side of w (+, ), and i(+ + ) for its value at a nearby point
on the negative side. then we have

i(+ + )+  i(+ + ) = (k  l)  w(n +#n ).

if the weight function w satises the identity
w(n +#n ) = w(n +)  w(n )

for all homology 3-spheres n ,

(26)

(27)

where multiplication is in the commutative ring r, then (26) can be written

i(+ + )+  i(+ + ) = (+  )  i(+)  i(),

(28)
as +   = k  l and w(n +#n ) = w(n +)  w(n ) = i(+)  i().
because of the bilinearity of the r.h.s. of (28) in i(+) and i(), it is
easy to see that (28) should also hold when there are nitely many special
lagrangian homology 3-spheres in the homology classes , and not just one
in each.

thus, (28) gives a formula for how we expect i(+ + ) to change as we
pass through the hypersurface w (+, ). the important thing about this
formula is that the values of i on the positive side of w (+, ) determine
the values of i on the negative side, and vice versa. so although i is not
invariant under deformations of (m, j, g) which alter the cohomology class
[], it appears to transform in a completely determined way, and that is
more or less as useful. however, we have only considered the simplest kind
of transition taking place on w (+, ), and we will shortly describe others
whose eects on i are more dicult to write down.

in 8.1 we proposed the weight function w(n) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12), for n a
homology 3-sphere. now h1(n +#n , z) = h1(n +, z)h1(n , z) as nite
groups, and so

(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n +#n , z)(cid:12)(cid:12) = (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n +, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n , z)(cid:12)(cid:12)

42

when n  are homology 3-spheres. thus this weight function w satises (27),
as we wish.

8.3

including multiple covers

let n  be a special lagrangian homology 3-sphere in a calabi-yau 3-fold
(m, j, g) with [n ] =   h3(m, z), and suppose for simplicity that n  is
embedded. let n be a nite cover of n  of degree d > 1, with covering map
 : n  n . then we can regard n as an immersed special lagrangian 3-
fold in m, with immersion   : n  m, where  : n   m is the inclusion
map. the homology class of n in m is [n] = d  [n ] = d in h3(m, z).
now n may or may not be a homology 3-sphere. suppose it is. then
n is an immersed special lagrangian homology 3-sphere in the homology
class d, and so it should make a contribution to the invariant i(d) we are
trying to construct. but what should this contribution be? following (24)
we could just put it to be w(n), and ignore the fact that n is a cover of n .
or we could look for a more general weight involving the topology of n and
n  and the covering map .

in fact the author believes that n should contribute w(n)/d to i(d).
note that if w takes values in z, then w(n)/d takes values in q, so that
our invariant i(d) will be actually be a rational number  which makes
its interpretation as the number of special lagrangian homology 3-spheres
problematic, but never mind.

here is why we want to assign the weight w(n)/d to n. suppose that
n  and n  are special lagrangian homology 3-spheres in (m, j, g) which
intersect transversely at one point p, and that n   n  is a positive inter-
section. let  and  be the homology classes of n , n  in h3(m, z). let
 : n  n  be a nite cover of degree d > 1 as above, and suppose n is also
a special lagrangian homology 3-sphere.
consider what happens to i(d + ) as we deform (m, j, g) so that []
passes through w (, ) going from the negative to the positive side. now
n intersects n  at d distinct points in n (although only one point in m), and
the intersection [n]  [n ] = d in homology. therefore, from 8.2, we would
expect to create d distinct new special lagrangian homology 3-spheres as we
pass through w (, ), all dieomorphic to n#n , which are the connected
sums of n and n  at the d points of intersection of n and n .

however, a little thought shows that we actually create only one special
lagrangian n#n  as we pass through w (, ). that is, the d copies of

43

n#n  all give the same special lagrangian 3-fold. we can think of the d
copies as being related by automorphisms of n in the covering group of the
cover  : n  n .
to be

now from (28), we would like the change in i(d + ) across w (, )

i(d + )+  i(d + ) = d  i(d)  i(),

(29)

since    = 1. suppose for simplicity that n, n  and n  are the only
special lagrangian homology 3-spheres in their homology classes. then we
have

i(d + )+  i(d + ) = w(n#n )

and i() = w(n ).

as w(n#n ) = w(n)  w(n ) by (27), it follows that (29) holds if i(d) =
w(n)/d. this is why n should contribute w(n)/d to i(d).
the author has not fully sorted out how nite covers behave under the

t 2-cone transitions considered in 5, but hopes to understand this soon.

8.4 a preliminary conjecture

i am now ready to formulate a rst guess as to how to dene an invariant
counting special lagrangian homology 3-spheres, and what its properties
should be under deformations of the underlying calabi-yau 3-fold.
it is
possible  even likely  that my guess is wrong, and that special lagrangian
3-folds just do not behave well enough for any such invariant to have nice
properties under deformation. even if my guess is basically correct, it will
probably need to be modied later, in the light of a clearer understanding of
special lagrangian 3-folds. but i hope that these ideas will in the meantime
help mathematicians and string theorists to work out what the right answers
are.

we begin by dening our invariant i.

denition 8.2 let (m, j, g) be a calabi-yau 3-fold, with kahler form 
and holomorphic volume form . we say that [] is generic in h 2(m, r) if
whenever   h2(m, z) is nonzero in h2(m, r), then []   6= 0. we say
that [] is generic in h 3(m, c) if [] does not lie on any of the hypersurfaces
w (+, ) dened in denition 7.3. these conditions hold in dense subsets
of h 2(m, r) and h 3(m, c).

44

suppose [] and [] are generic. for each   h3(m, z), dene s() to

be

s() = (cid:8)isomorphism classes of pairs (n, f ):

n is an oriented rational homology 3-sphere,
f : n  m is an immersion, f (n) is a special
lagrangian 3-fold, and f([n]) =   h3(m, z)(cid:9).

here we consider two pairs (n1, f1) and (n2, f2) to be isomorphic if there
exists an orientation-preserving dieomorphism  : n1  n2 such that f1 =
f2  . for each (n, f ) in s(), dene the symmetry group g(n, f ) by

g(n, f ) = (cid:8)dieomorphisms  : n  n with f   = (cid:9).

then g(n, f ) is a nite group. suppose s() is nite, and dene a map
i : h3(m, z)  q by

i() = x(n,f )s()

.

(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(cid:12)(cid:12)g(n, f )(cid:12)(cid:12)

(30)

here are some remarks on this denition.

 the group g(n, f ) is {1} unless n is a nite cover of some other special
lagrangian homology 3-sphere n . in this case g(n, f ) acts freely on
n, and n  = n/g(n, f ). thus g(n, f ) is the covering group of the
cover  : n  n , and the degree of the cover is d = |g(n, f )|. hence
|h1(n, z)|/|g(n, f )| = w(n)/d, which is the contribution for a nite
cover we proposed in 8.3.

 the special lagrangian 3-fold n  = n/g(n, f ) has homology class
 = /|g(n, f )| in h3(m, z). thus, if  is a primitive element of
h3(m, z) then |g(n, f )| = 1 for all (n, f )  s(), since otherwise
/|g(n, f )| would not lie in h3(m, z). therefore, if  is a primitive
element of h3(m, z) then i() is a nonnegative integer.

 the assumption that [] and [] be generic is rather strong  we only
expect problems in dening i() on a small number of the hypersurfaces
[]   = 0 and []  w (+, ).
45

 it seems likely that one could extend the denition to nongeneric [] by
including a sum over certain kinds of singular special lagrangian 3-fold
in (30). for example, the singular 3-fold n0 with a t 2-cone singularity
considered in 8.1 should be counted, with weight the l.h.s. of (25).
note that this weight depends not only on the topology of n0, but also
on the local geometry of the singular point.

 is s() necessarily nite for each   h3(m, z)? the author does not

know.

 should we also include an appropriate sign 1 in (30), so that special
lagrangian homology 3-spheres are counted with signs? the author
believes not.

we can now state our conjecture on the behaviour of the invariant i.

conjecture 8.3 let (m, j, g) be a calabi-yau 3-fold with kahler form 
and holomorphic volume form , and suppose [] and [] are generic. let
i : h3(m, z)  q be as in denition 8.2. then
(a) i is invariant under deformations of (m, j, g) that change [] but leave
[] xed, or that multiply [] by a nonzero complex number. therefore i
depends only on the complex structure j on m, and not on the metric g.

(b) when we deform (m, j, g) so that [] passes through one of the hyper-
surfaces w (+, ) in h 3(m, c) given in denition 7.3, the invariant
i transforms according to a complicated set of rules that we are not yet
able to write down. some of these rules may involve other higher order
invariants dened by counting special lagrangian homology 3-spheres.
one of these rules should be that if + and  are primitive elements
of h3(m, z) and i(+ + ) are the values of i(+ + ) at two
nearby points on the positive and negative sides of w (+, ), then

i(+ + )+  i(+ + ) = (+  )  i(+)  i().

(31)

part (a) of this conjecture is a rm statement, and is clearly either true
or false. but part (b) is rather vague. here is the reason why. when we

46

pass through the hypersurface w (+, ) we expect to create or destroy new
special lagrangian 3-folds with homology class + + , which are connected
sums of 3-folds with homology classes + and . but this is only the
simplest kind of transition which happens on w (+, ).

1 , n +

for instance, if n +

2  s(+) and n   s(), then on w (+, )
we may create a new special lagrangian homology 3-sphere with homology
class 2+ + , dieomorphic to the triple connected sum n +
2 . so
there should be some change to i(2+ + ) on w (+, ). similarly, if a, b
are positive integers then we can try and take a multiple connected sum of a
elements of s(+) and b elements of s() to get a new special lagrangian
homology 3-sphere with homology class a+ + b.

1 #n #n +

the obvious thing to do is to look for a formula analogous to (31) for the
change to i(a+ + b), in terms of a, b, +  , i(+) and i(). the
leading term in this formula should be

i(a++b)+  i(a+ + b) =

c(a, b)  (+  )a+b1  i(+)a  i()b +    ,

where c(a, b) is a rational number depending on a, b, which is the number
of graphs of a certain kind, divided by a! b!. however, when we think about
this in detail, we run into a problem: can we include a special lagrangian
3-fold in our connected sum more than once, and if so, how? the answer to
this appears to be rather complex, and the author does not yet understand
it.

one last remark: to understand how i() transforms under deformations
of (m, j, g), we only really need to consider the singularities of special la-
grangian homology 3-spheres that occur in real codimension one in the mod-
uli space of calabi-yau 3-folds, because we can always avoid singularities of
higher codimension by choosing a generic path in the moduli space.

it may be that there are only a few kinds of singularity which occur in
real codimension one, and if so, this might make the task of understanding
the behaviour of i() easier than it at rst appears. the author believes that
the singularities considered in 4-5 and 7 occur in real codimension one.

8.5 relationships with string theory

i am indebted to bobby acharya for several discussions on string theory and
special lagrangian 3-folds, and most of the following ideas are based on sug-

47

gestions made by him. however, all of the mistakes and misunderstandings
were put in by me.

in string theory, special lagrangian 3-folds correspond roughly to phys-
ical objects called 3-branes. but a 3-brane is not just a 3-dimensional sub-
manifold n; it also carries with it a complex line bundle over n with a at
u(1) connection. we will call a 3-brane isolated if it admits no deformations,
which happens when n is a rational homology 3-sphere.

if n is a compact 3-manifold, then at u(1) connections on n are equiv-
alent to group homomorphisms h1(n, z)  u(1). but when h1(n, z) is
nite, it is easy to show using the theory of nite abelian groups that the
number of group homomorphisms h1(n, z)  u(1) is exactly (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12).
(cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12) at u(1) connections over n, and so n gives rise to (cid:12)(cid:12)h1(n, z)(cid:12)(cid:12)

hence, if n is a special lagrangian homology 3-sphere, then there are exactly

isolated 3-branes.

therefore, the invariant i() dened in (30) counts the number of isolated
3-branes in the homology class . so it is a natural thing to count from the
string theory point of view, although the author formulated conjecture 8.3
without knowing this. part (a) of the conjecture thus says that the number
of isolated 3-branes is independent of the kahler class []. however, when
we include multiple covers of n the invariant i() may not be an integer,
only a rational number, and so we cant really describe it as a number of
branes.

this raises the question of how to interpret multiple covers as 3-branes.
in string theory d coincident 3-branes give a complex vector bundle with
bre cd over n, equipped with a at u(d) connection. this is considered
as one 3-brane wrapped d times around n, and so we call them multiply-
wrapped 3-branes. for example, gopakumar and vafa [2] consider a special
type of multiply-wrapped 3-brane they call 3-brane bound states. these cor-
respond to special lagrangian homology 3-spheres with an irreducible at
u(d) connection, for d > 1.

motivated by this, one could try and dene more general invariants count-
ing numbers of isolated, multiply-wrapped 3-branes; and these may be the
higher-order invariants mentioned in part (b) of conjecture 8.3, and con-
tributing to the transformation formula for i. the author hopes to address
this in a subsequent paper.

another interesting question is whether it would be natural in string
theory to combine all our invariants i() into a generating function called a
superpotential, which would be a holomorphic (and thus continuous) function

48

on the moduli space of complex structures on m. the requirement that the
superpotential be continuous under transitions such as those considered in
7 should cast much light on the transformation of i under deformations of
the complex structure.

8.6 what use are the invariants anyway?

suppose this whole programme can be carried through, and we can dene
an invariant i : h3(m, z)  q counting special lagrangian homology 3-
spheres, which depends only on the complex structure, and transforms in a
denite way under deformations of the complex structure. what would this
invariant tell us?

the author expects that the invariant should encode a lot of information
about the global structure of the moduli space of complex structures on
m, in particular its singularities, and the monodromies around them. if we
deform (m, j, g) so that the volume of a special lagrangian 3-fold goes to
zero, then the complex structure must become singular. thus, if i() 6= 0
near the complex hyperplane []   = 0, then we expect (m, j) to become
singular when []   = 0. for instance, this happens when (m, j) develops
an ordinary double point.
at such singularities, the identication between the moduli space of com-
plex structures and p (h 3(m, c)) breaks down. if we go around a loop in
the moduli space encircling the singular hypersurface, then h3(m, z) and
h 3(m, c) are transformed by an automorphism called a monodromy. if we
know the invariant i and its transformation properties, we may able to de-
duce what the monodromy is.

for as we deform [] round a small loop about []   = 0, the transfor-
mation rules tell us how to change i as we pass through each hypersurface
w (+, ). but when [] returns to its starting point, we dont get the
original invariant i, but instead the composition of i with the monodromy
around the loop. by comparing the initial and nal versions of i we get a
condition on the monodromy, which may determine it entirely.
