(1) (2) (3) turns existence global symmetries crucial mechanism z2 symmetry plays important role model. one may conclude , scalar potential v () takes minimum value z2 symmetry broken. is, however, hasty conclusion, ground state would given = q 2 see below. let us suppose one space coordinates, say, xd1 compactied circle s1 whose radius r. since s1 multiply-connected action z2 symmetry, impose following nontrivial boundary condition associated z2 symmetry eld : (x, + 2r) = (x, y), (4) x denote coordinates uncompactied spacetime. thanks z2 symmetry, action (1) still single-valued even boundary condition (4). 1 important consequence nontrivial boundary condition (4) vacuum ex- pectation value (x, y) cannot (y-independent) nonzero constant, incon- sistent boundary condition (4). words, nonzero vacuum expectation value (x, y) dependence order satisfy boundary condition (4), i.e. h(x, y)i 6= 0 yh(x, y)i 6= 0. (5) immediately follows vacuum translationally invariant vacuum expec- tation value (x, y) vanish, conversely (x, y) acquires nonzero vacuum expectation value, implies dependence h(x, y)i, trans- lational invariance s1-direction spontaneously broken. order nd vacuum conguration, one might try minimize potential v (). is, however, wrong present model. nd vacuum conguration, take account kinetic terms addition potential terms since translational invari- ance could broken vacuum conguration might coordinate-dependent. since translational invariance (uncompactied) (d 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime expected unbroken, nding vacuum conguration model may equivalent solving minimization problem following functional : e z 2r 0 dy(cid:26)1 2 (y)2 + v ()(cid:27) . (6) paper, analysis restricted tree level. following, shall ignore x dependence since interested vacuum conguration, translational invariance (d 1)-dimensional emphasized (y) minkowski spacetime assumed unbroken. cannot arbitrary function obey (antiperiodic) boundary condition (y + 2r) = (y). (7) translational invariance s1-direction unbroken, vacuum expectation value vanish functional e becomes e = r4 . (8) e may regarded potential viewpoint (d 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime. 2 exists conguration (y) e < e = r4 , (9) conguration = 0 longer vacuum conguration hence trans- lational invariance s1-direction broken, discussed previously. minimizing functional e, would like make comment solutions eld equation (y) 0 = e (y) d2(y) dy2 + = 2 (y) ((y))2 2 2 ! . (10) rst note = 0 trivial solution eq.(10), another trivial (would-be) solutions = q 2 eld equation eliminate term 1 excluded due boundary condition (7). using r4 2(y(y))2 eq.(6), nd z 2r e.

(for periodic boundary condition, 2n1 eq.(14) replaced 2n .) may denote solution specied eq.(14) integer n n(y). note k runs zero one right hand side eq.(14) increases monotonically rn (n 1 2 )/ innity. thus, n(y) solution r rn. 0 < r r1, exists one solution eld equation (10), i.e. trivial solution = 0. thus, vacuum conguration given trivial solution, hence translational invariance unbroken 0 < r r1. r1 < r r2, exist two solutions eq.(10), i.e. trivial one 1(y). follows eq.(11) trivial solution = 0 longer vacuum conguration. since 1(y) depends y, translational invariance s1-direction spontaneously broken. rn < r rn+1, exist n + 1 solutions eq.(10), i.e. trivial one m(y) = 1, 2, , n. since e < e every m, trivial solution longer vacuum conguration, hence translational invariance s1-direction spontaneously broken rn < r rn+1. therefore, found 0 < r r1 translational invariance s1-direction unbroken, r > r1 broken spontaneously z2 symmetry breaking. let us next discuss problem solution n(y) true vacuum conguration, i.e. solution minimizes functional e. r > rn, n(y) becomes solution obtain rather complicated expression e = (2n 1)3 3(1 + k2)3/2 n(1 k2)(5 + 3k2)k(k) + 8(1 + k2)e(k)o , (15) e(k) complete elliptic function second kind. although could directly compare e n = 1, 2, 3, , shall take another approach solve 4 problem. dicult show de dr = 4 1 + k2!2 1 k2 0, (16) implies e monotonically increasing function r. r = rn (k = 0) (k = 1), e takes values e = (2n 1) e = (2n 1) respectively. follows eqs.(16) (17) 3 , 2 423 3 , (2n 1) 3 2 e < (2n 1) 423 3 especially e < 423 3 . observations enough show r rn (n 2) e < e < e. therefore, found vacuum expectation value h(x, y)i = ( 0 1(y) r r1 r > r1. (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) may instructive reanalyze model viewpoint fourier expansion. follows boundary condition (7) (y) may expanded fourier-series s1-direction (y) = 1 r xl=1(cid:26)a(2l1) cos(cid:18)(2l 1) 2r(cid:19) + b(2l1) sin(cid:18)(2l 1) 2r(cid:19)(cid:27) , equivalently, (y) = 1 2r xlz (2l1)ei(2l1) 2r (22) (2l1) = 12(a(2l1) ib(2l1)) = (2l+1). key observation constant zero mode excluded expansion due nontrivial boundary condition. inserting eq.(22) eq.(6), have, quadratic terms respect (2l1), e0 = xl=1 m2 (2l1)|(2l1)|2, 5 (23) m2 2r !2 (2l1) 2 + 2l 1 . (24) second term eq.(24) kaluza-klein mass, comes kinetic 2 (y(y))2, gives positive contribution squared mass term. term 1 easily see r r1 squared masses m2 (2l1) positive semi-denite 2r (cid:17)2 induced kaluza-klein masses (cid:16) 2l1 . hand, r > r1 seems negative squared masses appear. signal phase transition consistent results obtained before. may interesting point translational invariance s1-direction reinterpreted global u(1) symmetry, fact possessed theory compactication. see this, note innitesimal translation + eq.(22) equivalently realized, terms fourier modes, following transformation: (2l1) ei( 2l1 may assign u(1) charge 2l1 2r (2l1). thus, spontaneous breakdown translational invariance s1-direction may interpreted 2r )a(2l1), (25) u(1) symmetry. one might ask nambu-goldstone mode associated spontaneous breakdown translational invariance u(1) symmetry. turns that, answer question, following mode expansion suitable fourier mode expansion r > r1 : (y) = xl=1na(2l1)ec2l1(y, k) + b(2l1)es2l1(y, k)o , (26) ec2l1(u, k) es2l1(u, k) eigenfunctions so-called lame equation n = 2  " d2 du2 + n(n + 1)k2sn2(u, k)# (u, k) = (k)(u, k), boundary condition (u + 2k(k), k) = (u, k). (27) (28) ec2l1(u, k) es2l1(u, k) may supplemented following conditions : eigenfunctions ec es dierently dened ref.. ec2l1(u, k) = +ec2l1(u, k), 6 es2l1(u, k) = es2l1(u, k), ec2l1(u, k) es2l1(u, k) 1 r 1 r cos ((2l 1)u) sin ((2l 1)u) k 0, k 0. (29) (30) expansion (26), a(2l1) b(2l1) correspond normal modes around back- ground = 1(y). set (k) = (1 + k2)(1 + m2 2 ), m2 may correspond squared mass (d 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime. lowest eigenvalues eigenfunctions lame equation n = 2 exactly known, eigen- functions given so-called lame polynomials . two satisfy desired boundary condition (28), given ec1(u, k) cn(u, k)dn(u, k) es1(u, k) sn(u, k)dn(u, k) m2 = 0 (cid:16) 3k2 1+k2(cid:17) 2, respectively. noting ec1(y, k) d1(y) mode associated spontaneous breakdown translational invariance u(1) , know mode a(1) really massless nambu-goldstone dy symmetry. shown translational invariance s1-direction spontaneously broken model (1) boundary condition (7) radius r becomes larger critical radius r1. mechanism break translational invariance specic model all. let us briey discuss general strategy construct models translational invariance compactied spaces broken spon- taneously. suppose space dimensions compactied manifold translational invariance. let v (i) scalar potential. mechanism may require v (i) satisfy following two conditions: (i) origin j = 0 minimum potential v (i). (ii) let j conguration minimizes v (i). then, j j 6= 0 non-singlets global symmetries theory. key ingredient mechanism impose nontrivial boundary conditions non-singlet elds j j 6= 0, consistent global symmetries theory. would variety models since wide choice potentials, compactied spaces boundary conditions. general feature models 7 translational invariance compactied spaces expected unbroken scales compactied spaces suciently small broken spontaneously global symmetries scales become large enough. finally, would like make comments vacuum structures models application supersymmetric eld theories. limit r (k 1), (y) eq.(12) reduce q 2 tanh(cid:16) 2(y y0)(cid:17). nothing (static) single kink solution = 2 dimensions . so, model considered may regarded real 4 model single kink background sitting line limit r . observation suggests models based breaking mechanism might regarded quantum eld theories (topologically) nontrivial backgrounds broken phase translational invariance. second comment vacuum structures models expected quite nontrivial, general. see this, let us consider simple extension model (1) replacing real eld complex one u(1) symmetry also boundary condition (7) (y + 2r) = ei2(y). one might expect vacuum structure similar original real 4 model. not, however, case. fact, studied ref.{$9810061$}, model admits rich set solutions eld equation (y), vacuum conguration quite dierent real 4 model k. nal comment would worth applying mechanism supersymmetric eld theories. ref., shown mechanism used break supersymmetry spontaneously susy breaking mechanism new, is, dierent oraifeartaigh  fayet-iliopoulos  mechanisms. would great importance use new susy breaking mechanism construct phenomenologically interesting supersymmetric models. acknowledgments would like thank h. hatanaka c. s. lim useful discussions. k.t. would like thank i.n.f.n, sezione di pisa hospitality. ksince ref.{$9810061$} eld equation solved periodic boundary condition, reanalyze eld equation proper boundary condition. 8
