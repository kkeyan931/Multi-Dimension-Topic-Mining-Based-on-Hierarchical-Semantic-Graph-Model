abstract

we study kaluza-klein spectrum of type iib string theory compactied on ads5 
in the context of ads/cf t correspondence. we examine some of the modes of the

t nn

complexied 2 form potential as an example and show that for the states at the bottom

of the kaluza-klein tower the corresponding d = 4 boundary eld operators have rational

conformal dimensions. the masses of some of the fermionic modes in the bottom of each

tower as functions of the r charge in the boundary conformal theory are also rational.
furthermore the modes in the bottom of the towers originating from q forms on t 11 can

be put in correspondence with the brs cohomology classes of the c = 1 non critical string

theory with ghost number q. however, a more detailed investigation is called for, to clarify

further the relation of this supergravity background with the c = 1 strings.

1. introduction

it has recently been suggested by klebanov and witten[1] that the world volume

super yang mills theory of parallel d3-branes near a conical singularity of a calabi-yau
manifold are related to string theory on ads5  t 11. they argue that string theory on
ads5t 11, with t 11 = (su (2)  su (2))/u (1) can be described in terms of an n = 1
superconformal su (n )  su (n ) gauge theory.
in the absence of a rigorous proof of
the ads/cft correspondence [2][3] one needs to have the kaluza-klein spectrum of the

supergravity in the above geometry. the kaluza-klein masses are used to identify the

anomalous dimensions of the operators on the yang mills side[4][5].

the manifold t 11 also enters in the geometrical description of c = 1 matter compacti-

ed on a circle at the self dual radius coupled to the d = 2 gravity, the so called non critical

d=2 string theory. it has been shown in [6] that the symmetry algebra of the volume pre-
serving dieomorphisms of the cone based on t 11 is in fact in a 1 1 correspondence with
the symmetry algebra of (1,0) and (0,1) conformal primary elds of the c = 1 theory at

the self dual radius. it is therefore tempting to ask if there is any relationship between the
c = 1 theory and the type iib string theory compactied on ads5t 11. we will also touch
upon the relation of kaluza-klein spectrum on t nn and c = 1 string theory at n-times the

self dual radius in the last section.

the kaluza-klein modes are characterised by a set of quantum numbers {l, l, s},
where l and l characterise the su (2) su (2) multiplets and s, related to the r charge in
the yang mills side, is a u (1) charge taking integer or 1/2 integer values. the lowest values
of l and l will depend on s. for any given s there is an innite tower of kaluza klein
modes. we shall show that for any given s and for some ( but not all) of the modes with
the smallest possible values of l and l there corresponds well dened cohomology classes in
the ghost numbers 0, 1 and 2 sectors of the c = 1 theory. more precisely we shall show that
the kaluza klein modes in ads5 originating from q forms in t 11 are in correspondence
with the cohomology classes with ghost number q on the c = 1 side. they have identical
su (2)  su (2) quantum numbers. however the modes originating from the components
of the metric in the internal space seem to be unmatched. along the way we shall show

that the derivation of the kaluza-klein spectrum can be reduced to the problem of the

diagonalization of dierential operators acting on tensors and spinors in the background
of monopole elds on s2  s2. as an example we give the kaluza-klein masses of some of
the bosonic and fermionic elds.

1

possible correspondence between c = 1 theory at self dual radius and the type iib

strings on conifold singularities have been noted in the past by ghoshal and vafa [7] . we

shall comment on this paper at the end the present note.

2. the manifolds t nn

and the kaluza-klein modes

although manifolds t nn are related to the c = 1 string theory, kaluza-klein spectrum
for n 6= n. below we will study the kaluza-klein spectrum of
. in the end when we will relate our results

can be studied on any t nn
type iib string theory compactied on t nn
to c = 1 string theory we will take n = n.

the geometry of the manifolds t nn

is dened in terms of the metric[8]

ds4 = c2(dy5n cos y1dy2n cos y3dy4)2 +a2(dy2

1 +sin2 y1dy2

2)+a2

(dy2

3 +sin2 y3dy2

4). (1)

all the coordinates y are angles, such that y = (y1, y2) parametrise a s2 of radius a
while y = (y3, y4) parametrise a s2 of radius a. the angle y5 ranges from 0 to 4.
the constant c is the radius of the circle dened by y5. the constants n and n will be
taken to be integers. we shall denote these manifolds by t nn
. locally they look like
s2  s2  s1. their isometry group is su (2)  su (2)  u (1), where the u (1) factor is
due to the translational invariance of the coordinate y5. it has been argued by klebanov

and witten that the u (1) factor should be identied with the r symmetry of the world
volume n = 1, d = 4 superconformal eld theory which arises as a consequence of the
ads/cf t correspondence. we shall see that it can also be put in correspondence with

the u (1) group generated by the liouville mode of the c = 1 string theory. in this way

the r charges of the boundary d = 4 superconformal theory will be set in correspondence

with the liouville momenta of the c = 1 theory.

in order for ads5t nn

to be a supersymmetric solution of the type iib eld equations
it is necessary that a = a = 16|e|
3n , where, e2 is related to the
ads5 cosmological constant through r = 4e2g . for the present discussion we can
keep the background parameters arbitrary.

, n = n and ec =  1

our strategy for the kaluza klein expansion is to dispose of the y5 coordinate by
fourier expansion. as a result of this we obtain innite number of elds living on ads5 
s2  s2. writing every object in an orthonormal basis of the s2  s2 manifold we obtain
innite number of elds coupled to a magnetic monopole eld of charge ns on the rst s2
and ns on the second s2. the harmonic expansion on the magnetic monopole background

2

has been studied in detail in [9] . we will use the formalism of this reference to write down
the eigenvalues of the s2  s2 laplacian acting on any eld. in this way we will obtain
the kaluza klein modes which depend on the coordinates of ads5 only.

to implement this idea we need the components of the 5-bein and the spin connections

on t nn

. they are given by

e1
1 =

e3

1
a

.

(2)

from these one can calculate the components of the spin connections. they are given by

a[bc] = abc, 5[ab] = eab, a[b5] = eab
m[nl] = mnl, 5[mn] = emn, m[n5] = emn,

(3)

where a = (1 = 0, 2 =  1
a cot y3). these are
just the components of a magnetic monopole potential on each s2. for what follows it is

a cot y1) and m = (3 = 0, 3 =  1

important to note that e5

a = na and e5

m = nm.

to clarify the scheme let us look at the derivatives of a d = 10 scalar (x, y5, y, y).

first we write

(x, y5, y, y) = xs 1

2 z

eisy5

s(x, y, y)

(4)

since the angle y5 ranges over a period of 4, s takes integer as well as 1/2 integer values.
the derivative operator on t nn

then acts on the fourier modes s according to

is
c

(x, y, y)

d5(x, , y, y) =
das(x, y, y) = (a  insa)s(x, y, y) = as(x, y, y)
dms(x, y, y) = (m  insm)s(x, y, y) = ms(x, y, y).

(5)

we thus see that as(x, y, y) and ms(x, y, y) are precisely the orthonormal frame
components of the covariant derivatives of a charged scalar eld coupled to u (1) monopole

elds on each sphere. furthermore the u (1) charge of s on the rst s2 is ns and on the

second s2 it is ns.

3

the above covariant derivatives dictate the form of harmonic expansions for each s.

following the notation of [9] we can write

s(x, y, y) = xl|n1s|,||l

(2l + 1)

1

2 xl|ns|,||l

(2l + 1)

1

2 s,l,l

, (x)dl

ns,(l1

y )dl

ns, (l1
y )

(6)

in these formulae the spheres are regarded as the coset manifolds su (2)/u (1). the su (2)
group element ly represents the point y  s2 and dl
y ) are the matrix elements
of the unitary irreducible representations of su (2) carrying spin l. their most important

ns,(l1

property for us is that

dl

q,(l1

y ) =

i

2a1p(l  q)(l  q + 1)dl

q,(l1
y )

(7)

the u (1) basis  on the rst s2 are dened by  = 12
 = 12
we shall denote the u (1) basis by a prime, viz, 

(1  i2). on the second s2
(3  i4).

from these relations we can easily read the eigenvalues of the laplacian action on the

charge q objects on s2, viz,

aadl

q,(l1

y ) = (+ + +)dl

q,(l1

y ) = 

1
a2 (l(l + 1)  q2)dl

q,(l1
y )

(8)

the eigenvalues of the 5 dimensional laplacian on s can now be read immediately. as

an example let us consider the complex dilaton. the linearised equation for this eld is

given by

noting that

(dd + dd)(x, y5, y, y) = 0

dd = (

s
c

)2 + aa + mm

we can simply read the ads5 mass of the mode s,l,l

, (x) as

m2 =

s2
c2 +

1
a2 (l(l + 1)  (ns)2) +

1
a2 (l(l + 1)  (ns)2)

(9)

(10)

(11)

where l | ns | and l | ns |.

for the next example we consider the complex, 2-form potential bm n . firstly, the

components b are t nn

scalars. therefore they must be treated exactly in the same way

4

as . the remaining components can be decomposed into various tensors on s2  s2 .
here we list the result,

ddb5 = [(

s
c

)2 + aa + mm  4e2]b5  2eababb  2emnmbn

(12)

ddb = [(
ddb = [(

s
c  e)2 + aa + mm  e2]b  2ieb5
s
c  e)2 + aa + mm  e2]b  2ie

b5

(13)

(14)

in these relations the covariant derivatives are dened by the u (1) charge of each object.
for an object bpq of charge p on the rst s2 and charge q in the second s2 we have,

abpq = (a  ipa)bpq

and mbpq = (m  iqm)bpq

where a and m denote the partial derivatives in the orthonormal basis. the (p, q) charges
of b5, b, b, and b() are, respectively , (ns, ns), (ns  1, ns), (ns, ns  1) and
(ns  1, ns  1). these charges determine the lower bounds of l and l in the harmonic
expansion of bpq on s2 s2. the expansion of bpq is identical to the one of  given above
except that we should put the lower bounds l | p | and l | q |.

other bosonic elds can be treated in a similar way. we tabulate the (p, q) charges of

all of the bosonic elds of the type iib supergravity in table i.

the technique outlined above can be used to obtain the kaluza klein masses of small
perturbations around the background solution ads5  t nn. the full analysis, although
straightforward, is quite lengthy and will not be given here. here we shall give the result

of calculation of the masses of those modes which decouple without too much labour from

the rest of the spectrum. the easiest one is the complex scalar for which we gave the

spectrum of the masses in the previous section. we shall next consider the complex 2-form

potential bm n .

note that for each s there is an innite tower of modes in each eld. we shall consider

only some of these towers whose mass can easily be deduced. for each s this happens for
the modes with the smallest values of l and l. consider rst the modes with ns  1. in
this case the modes bs,ns1,ns
decouple from the rest of the system. using the background
values of 1



a2 = 6e2, 1

ec = 3n we obtain

2dd[bs,ns1,ns

]

 e2[(3ns + 1)2  1]bs,ns1,ns



= 0

(15)

5

identical equation will result for bs,ns,ns1

.



for the range of ns  1 it is the leading modes of bs,ns1,ns

+

and bs,ns,ns1

+

which decouple. their equation of motion becomes

2dd[bs,ns1,ns

]+

 e2[(3ns  1)2  1]bs,ns1,ns

+

= 0

(16)

and an identical equation for bs,ns,ns1

+

.

following [10] we shall identify e2[(3ns + 1)2  1] as the ads mass2 of bs,ns1,ns

and
. likewise e2[(3ns1)21] will be identied with the ads mass of bs,ns1,ns



+

bs,ns,ns1
and bs,ns,ns1



.

+

according to the ads/cf t correspondence every bulk eld in ads5 should corre-
spond to a well dened gauge invariant operator in the boundary d = 4 theory. for an ads

mode of mass m which originates from a p form eld in the internal space the conformal
dimension  of the d = 4 theory is given by (  p)( + p  4) = m2. clearly only very
small subset of modes will produce a rational solution for . this is what happens to the
modes singled out above, namely, the conformal dimension of the elds dual to bs,ns1,ns
turn out to be 3(1 + ns) and those of the elds corresponding to bs,ns1,ns
and bs,ns,ns1
and bs,ns,ns1
are equal to 3ns + 1.


+


+

the same phenomenon also happens for the complex dilaton modes. this was observed

by gubser [11] . from our equation (11) it follows that for any given s the smallest masses
are obtained for l = l =| ns |, which is m2 = e2[(3 | ns | +2)2  4]. plugging this in the
formula for the dimension with p = 0 produces the positive root  = 4 + 3 | ns | . gubser
has conjectured that for a given s this will happen to every mode in the bottom of the

tower with that value of s.

we can also obtain the fermion masses. the easiest one is the dilatino. it satises the

equation

(d/x + id/y + e) = 0

(17)

we categorise the spectrum of id/y using the quantum number s. for the sake of
simplicity let us set n = n = 1. let us take | s | 1/2. in this case we have four subsectors.
we will use the notation (s) to denote sign of s and dene (0) = 1 in the fourth sector
below. we shall also introduce the function (l, s) through (l, s) = 1
2 )2  s2 and
dene (l, s) = (l, s).

aq(l + 1

in the rst sector we have only one eigenvalue

(l, l) = (

1
2

+ | s |, 

1
2

+ | s |) = (s)e(1 + 3 | s |).

(18)

6

the second sector is dened by l =| s | 1/2, l | s | +1/2. here we have two towers
parametrised by l

(

1
2

+ | s |, l) = (s)

e

2 r2 +

e2

[1 + 12 | s | (1 + 3 | s |)]

(19)

and in particular for l =| s | +1/2 the eigenvalue is rational

+ | s |) = (s)

+ | s |,

(20)

in the third sector, which is dened by l | s | +1/2 , l =| s | 1/2, for each s again

we have two towers parametrised by l

(l,

[1 + 12 | s | (1 + 3 | s |)]

(21)

and as in the case of sector two, for l =| s | +1/2 the eigenvalue is rational. i.e.,

(

2

+ | s |, 

1
2

+ | s |) = (s)

e

2  | e |

2

(6 | e | +5).

(22)

in the fourth sector, we will relax the condition to | s | 0. thus the s = 0 modes are
included in this sector. this sector is dened by l | s | +1/2 , l | s | +1/2. here we
have four towers and they are given by

1 (l, l, s) = (s)

in this case, however, we nd that for l = l =| s | +1/2, only two eigenvalues, 2 become
rational, except for the case s = 0 when 1 also becomes rational.

from the above list of the eigenvalues of id/y one can also obtain the masses of the ads
gravitinos as well as the gamma trace of the gravitino,  . this latter eld satises an

7

equation similar to (17) in which e is replaced by 3e, whereas the d traceless and gamma

traceless gravitino  satises

d/xj

() = 0.

where j indicates the eigenvalues of id/y and j runs over various sectors.

the fermionic modes in the direction of the killing spinor in t nn satisfy equations

similar to those in refs[10] .

3. relation to c=1 string theory

the fundamental elds of the c = 1 theory are two scalars x and  and the b, c
ghost elds. x is targeted on a s1 while  is coupled to a background charge. at the

self dual radius r = 1/2 of the circle there is a su (2)  su (2) symmetry. the brs

cohomology classes are organised according to the representations of this group. these

classes are also labeled by their ghost numbers. of interest to us are the ghost number
zero, one and two operators given respectively by os,p(z)os,p(z), y +
s+1,p(z)os,p(z) as well
+
as a(z, z)os,p(z)os,p (z) and y +
s,p (z). the complex conjugates of these operators
should also be added to the list. in each case the subscript s characterises the su (2) 
su (2) content of each object. for a given integer or 1/2 integer s the indices p and p
range from s to +s[6].

now consider a kaluza-klein tower originating from a q-form eld in t 11. for a given

s,p(z)y

u (1) charge s we consider the modes at the bottom of each tower ( those which presumably

have rational conformal dimensions in the boundary gauge theory). our observation is that

these kaluza-klein modes are in correspondence with the ghost number q cohomology

classes in the c = 1 theory. in table 1 we have listed all the kaluza-klein modes and

the corresponding objects in the c = 1 model. note that the modes originating from
the components of the metric in t 11 ( which are not q-forms in the internal space!) do

not seem to have a counterpart in the c = 1 side. furthermore the modes corresponding

to an operator containing a(z, z) in the c = 1 side can actually be gauged away in the

kaluza-klein side.

the c = 1 theory has an innite dimensional algebra given in terms of the volume
preserving dieomorphisms of the quadric cone a1a2  a3a4 = 0. it is known that the base
of this cone is isomorphic to t 11. in the context of present discussion the 3 complex dimen-

sional ricci at cone is in fact identical to the subspace transverse to the d3-brane solution

8

of the type iib supergravity. our kaluza-klein background is a near horizon approxima-

tion to this d3 brane geometry. thus the cone seems to be the common geometrical entity
in the two very dierent looking theories1.

let us consider the quadric cone a1a2  a3a4 = 0. this cone is singular at its apex
a1 = a2 = a3 = a4 = 0. one can resolve the singularity by deforming the dening equation
into a1a2  a3a4 = . from the point of c = 1 theory  corresponds to the 2-dimensional
cosmological constant. one can also consider a topological  model targeted on a cy three

fold near a conical singularity, for which the local equation is the same as our quadratic

expression. for both of these theories the free energies can be evaluated as a function

of  and can be expressed as a genus expansion.

in [7] ghoshal and vafa argued that

in fact the two theories must be the same. they observed that, at the self dual radius,

the g = 0, 1 and 2 contributions to the free energy of the c = 1 theory agree with the

corresponding terms of the free energy of the topological sigma model near the conifold

singularity. subsequently, assuming the type ii-heterotic duality, the results of[13] gave

further support to the ghoshal vafa conjecture. these authors calculated the coecient of
the term r2f 2g2 in the eective action of the heterotic theory compactied on k3  t 2
and realised that for any g the coecient is also given by the genus g term of the partition

function of the c = 1 theory at the self dual radius. more recently gopakumar and vafa

[14] have calculated the  model partition function near a conifold singularity and have

proven the conjecture made in [7] .

a better understanding of the correspondences noted above may require the unraveling

of the relevance of the volume preserving dieomorphisms of the cone in the d3 brane
context. on the basis of the observations made in this note we would like to think that

the c = 1 theory at the self dual radius has a role to play in organising the chiral primaries
of the boundary su (n )  su (n ) superconformal gauge theory.

1 similar remarks can be made about the manifolds t nn. in this case we should consider the

c = 1 string theory at n times the self-dual radius [12].
