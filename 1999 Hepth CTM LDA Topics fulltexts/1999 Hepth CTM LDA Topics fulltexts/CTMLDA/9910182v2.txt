we study geometric engineering of argyresdouglas superconformal theories realized

by type iib strings propagating in singular calabiyau threefolds. we use this construc-

tion to count the degeneracy of light bps states under small perturbations away from the

conformal point, by computing the degeneracy of d3branes wrapped around supersym-

metric 3cycles in the calabiyau. we nd nitely many bps states, the number of which

depends on how this deformation is done, similarly to the degeneracy of kink solutions for

the deformation of n = 2 landauginzburg superconformal theories in two dimensions.

also, some aspects of worldsheet theories near general calabiyau singularities are dis-

cussed.

1. introduction

in the past few years we have learned how to generate superconformal theories in

various dimensions. nevertheless we do not understand the properties of conformal theo-

ries in dimensions greater than two with the same precision as we do in the case of two

dimensions.

in two dimensions, one powerful method to study conformal theories was pioneered

by zamolodchikov [1], who studied their properties under special integrable massive de-

formations. zamolodchikovs idea was to use the properties of the deformed theories, such

as the spectrum of kinks and their scattering matrix amplitudes, to reconstruct the full

data of the conformal theory. as a particular example of this philosophy, it was subse-

quently shown in the case of massive deformations of (2, 2) superconformal theories in two

dimensions [2] that just the degeneracy of the (bps saturated) kinks of the massive theory

characterizes the dimensions of chiral operators at the conformal point.

it is thus natural, in the context of conformal theories in dimensions bigger than

2, to also ask the same question, namely, what is the number of bps states for slight

deformations of these theories away from the conformal point. for certain cases, this has

been answered. for example we know the degeneracy for n = 4 theories in 4 dimensions [3]

and some superconformal n = 2 theories (for example su (2) with four doublets) [4]. the

aim of this paper is to widen the class of theories for which we know the bps spectrum.

the case of n = 2 eld theories in 4 dimensions is already very interesting from this

point of view. in a limited set of cases, including certain n = 2 su(2) gauge theories, the

bps spectrum can be computed exactly using eld theory techniques [4][5]. however, there

are many interesting 4d n = 2 theories for which we know very little about the structure

of their bps spectra, including the superconformal theories of argyres and douglas [6]. in

this paper, our main result will be a determination of the degeneracy of the bps states un-
der slight deformations away from argyresdouglas points.3 we realize argyresdouglas

superconformal theories and their deformations in terms of type iib strings propagating

in a (nearly) singular calabiyau threefold. the bps states are realized in this setup in

terms of d3branes wrapped around supersymmetric 3cycles on the threefold. the struc-

ture of bps states of argyresdouglas superconformal theories are among the simplest to

study from this point of view because the counting of the supersymmetric 3-cycles gets

made by gustavsson and henningson [7].

related to counting certain special 1-cycles on a riemann surface. we nd a structure very

reminiscent of bps degeneracies of the deformations of minimal n = 2 superconformal

theories in 2d. in particular we nd that the spectrum of light bps states is nite and

depends on how we deform away from the conformal point.

the structure of this paper is as follows: in section 2 we review certain aspects of

calabiyau d-folds which have isolated singularities. we point out a connection between

normalizable deformations of a calabiyau singularity and unitarity bounds of the corre-
sponding quantum eld theory in the remaining rn. in section 3 we make some remarks

about the string worldsheet description near a calabiyau singularity. in section 4 we

specialize to the case of calabiyau threefold, which gives rise to n = 2 superconformal

theories in 4 dimensions. we set up the computation for counting the number of super-

symmetric 3-cycles for this case.

in section 5 we apply these techniques to the case of

argyresdouglas conformal theories and compute their spectra.

2. calabiyau singularities

in this section we consider calabiyau manifolds with an isolated singularity. more
precisely we consider a local model for a d-fold given by a hypersurface w (xi) = 0 in cd+1.
moreover we assume w (xi) is a quasihomogeneous function of xi:

w (qixi) = w (xi).

(2.1)

we assume the singularity is isolated, namely

dw = 0

i

xi = 0.

if w is viewed as a lg superpotential of an n = 2 theory in 2 dimensions [8][9] it would

ow to a superconformal theory with central charge c given by

c =

d+1xi=1

(1  2qi) = (d + 1)  2(xi

qi).

(2.2)

the condition that the calabiyau threefold with this singularity appear at nite distance

in moduli space was recently studied in [10] with the conclusion that if

c < d  1

2

(2.3)

the distance is nite and thus the study of singularity would be of physical interest only

in this case.

an interesting question involves deformations of the singularity. in this context, as in

the 2 dimensional case [8][9], it is natural to consider the singularity ring of w

generated by the monomials

r = c[xi]/dw

x = x1

d+1

1 x2

2 ...xd+1

modulo setting to zero those polynomials which are in the ideal generated by iw . one
then considers deformations of the form

w  w + xr

gx.

for each element x in the ring, consider the charge

the q lie in the range

q =xi

qii.

0  q  c.

moreover, the elements in the ring are paired so that for every element of the ring with
charge q there is one with charge cq. the degeneracy of the ring elements is captured
by the function

tq =yi
and the dimension of the ring r is given by

xr

(1  t1qi)
(1  tqi)

n = dimr =

d+1yi=1

(1  qi)

qi

.

this dimension is also the dimension of compact part of mid-dimension homology hd(w =
). the compact homology can be realized by n spheres of dimension d with an intersection

structure that can be obtained from the structure of w [11].

in questions in string theory, it is important to know how many cohomology elements

of dimension d are supported on the singularity. these would correspond to normalizable

3

d-forms in the internal dimensions localized near the singularity. these forms can be

obtained from the holomorphic d-form represented as

 = qi dxi

dw

.

what this means is that we solve the equation w = 0 for one of the xi in terms of the
others and view dxi/dw as 1/iw in the above expression. the other d-forms correspond
to deformations of :

 = /g.

the condition that  lead to a normalizable form localized at the singularity was studied

in [10]. the condition for this is thatr ||2 diverge in the vicinity of xi = 0. it was found

that the deformation by monomial x corresponds to a normalizable cohomology element

if

q <

c  d + 3

2

.

(2.4)

note that combined with (2.3) this implies that a normalizable cohomology deformation

must have q < 1.

the condition (2.4) can also be understood physically by unitarity bounds of physical

modes as follows. the coecients g in the deformation of the singularity should corre-

spond in the eld theory setup, either to expectation values of scalar elds, or to coupling

constants of eld theory. we may assign dimensions to the coecients g as follows: if
we consider a ddbrane (or a d-dimensional part of a higher dimensional brane) wrapped

around a d-dimensional supersymmetric cycle c in the local geometry, it gives a particle

with bps mass

m =zc



which implies that the mass dimension of [] = 1. by quasihomogeneity, we can assign

a dimension to each variable xi proportional to its charge. the condition that [] = 1
implies that the dimension of a monomial x is given by

[x] =

2

d  1  c  q

and that the dimension of g is given by

[g] =

.

2(1  q)
(d  1  c)
4

(2.5)

the deformation parameter ga is the expectation value of a canonically normalized scalar
eld weighted with the yangmills coupling; that is, ga  gy mhai. since [gy m ] =
(4  d)/2 in d spacetime dimensions, the unitarity bound that []  (d  2)/2 in a
superconformal theory requires that

[g] =

2(1  q)
(d  1  c)

> 1

and this condition is identical to (2.4). thus, the mode is a physical eld if and only if

it satises the unitarity bound. this is quite a satisfactory result (which has also been

obtained independently in [12]).

let us now consider calabiyau manifolds of various dimensions and see what this

condition translates into in each case.

2.1. d=2

in the case of complex dimension 2, the nite distance condition (2.3) c < 1 implies

that w is given by the lg superpotential of n = 2 minimal models, which gives the usual

ade classication of k3 singularities. moreover the condition of physical elds (2.4) is

automatically satised for all elements in the ring because all the elements have

q  c <

c + 1

2

.

this is in accordance (in the type iia case) with the fact that all these deformations can

be viewed as giving vev to scalars in commuting directions of the adjoint representation of

the corresponding group.

2.2. d=3

for calabiyau 3-fold singularities, the condition of being at nite distance implies

that c < 2. if we consider type iib strings in the presence of such singularities we obtain

an n = 2 superconformal theory in 4 dimensions. examples of such w s are provided by

w = f (x, y) + z2 + w2

(2.6)

where f (x, y) is a quasihomogeneous function of x, y. in this case the function f (x, y)
can be identied [13] with a vebrane with worldvolume r4  , where  is the seiberg-
witten riemann surface f (x, y) = 0. in this case the singular calabiyau gets mapped

to a singular riemann surface. a special case of this

f (x, y) = xn + y2

5

corresponds to the argyresdouglas points that we will study in more detail later in this

paper.

there are other singularitities which are also at nite distance which are not of the

form (2.6). for example consider

w = x3 + y3 + z3 + w3n

type iib string in the presence of such a singularity describes a superconformal theory,

which does not have a description in terms of a seiberg-witten riemann surface. such sin-

gularities do arise in certain gauge theories. for example the above singularity appears in a
gauge theory with gauge group su (3n )su (2n )2su (n )3 with certain bi-fundamental
matter dictated by the ane e6 dynkin diagram [14].

in the case of the threefold, the condition that deformations x correspond to nor-

malizable forms is (2.4)

q < c/2.

given the pairing of the ring elements and the fact that the sum of the charges of the

pairs gives c, this means that the deformations that correspond to expectation values of

dynamical elds are in one to one correspondence with the deformations that correspond

to parameters in the theory. a natural interpretation of this pairing is to note that for

each chiral operator in the n = 2 superconformal theory  (whose lowest component is
identied with  where hi = g), we can consider the n = 2 superspace integral

s  s +z d4xd4 t

with t being identied with the dual deformations of w . the form of these deformations
implies that the mass dimensions obey [t] + [g] = 2. in fact this is consistent with what
we have found for the dimension of the parameters. namely, since the charges of dual

deformations add up to c we deduce that the charge corresponding to the t deformation is
cq and using the dimension of the elds given by (2.5) we see that indeed [t]+[g] = 2:

[g] =

2(1  q)
(2  c)

[t] =

2(1  c + q)

(2  c)
[g] + [t] = 2.

6

2.3. d=4

the case of local singularities of calabiyau 4-folds was studied in [10]. in particular,

the case of theories with c < 1 was studied in detail and it was shown that type iia string

in the presence of these singularities gives rise to certain n = 2 superconformal kazama-

suzuki models in 2 dimensions.

in these cases none of the deformations correspond to

dynamical elds in the 2d theory.

3. perturbative string description

it is natural to consider the perturbative string theory in the presence of such singu-

larities. of course, if we are at the singularity the string theory is singular and there is

no perturbative expansion. however, if we deform the quasihomogeneous function w we

can resolve the singularity. in such a case (if the singularity is resolved enough so that the

wrapped branes are heavy enough) we can expect to have a perturbative string description.

in this case one can use ideas developed in [15][16] in the context of compact calabiyau

manifolds and for the non-compact case in [17][18][19] to nd a landauginzburg descrip-
tion of the theory. namely consider d + 2 chiral elds x1, .., xd+1, y with n =2 u (1) charge
given by q1, ..., qd+1, 1/, and with a quasihomogeneous lg superpotential

gxy(q1).

(3.1)

w = w (xi) +x

 is xed by the requirement that the total c = d, which implies that

2

 =

.

d  c  1

note that the condition that the singularity be at nite distance (2.3) is that  > 0 and
the condition that the deformation given by g corresponds to a normalizable eld in
uncompactied theory is translated to the condition that the power of y accompanying
that deformation be less than 1. to obtain the full supersymmetric theory we also need
to do the gepner projection, which is a discrete orbifold of the above lg theory that keeps

only the integral u (1) charged elds.

a particular case of (3.1) is the deformation of w by a constant:

w = w + g0y

in this case it can be shown [17][18][19] that the resulting theory corresponds to the tensor

product of the lg theory given by w and a kazama-suzuki coset model sl(2)/u (1) with

level k = 2 + . this construction has also been noted independently in [12]. certain

aspects of conformal theories near singularities have also been discussed recently in [20].

7

4. solitons in the d = 3 case

for the rest of this paper we will be interested in studying some aspects of calabiyau

threefold singularities corresponding to argyresdouglas points. as already noted these

points correspond to local singularities given by

w = p (x) + y2 + z2 + w2 = 0

(4.1)

with p (x) a polynomial of degree n in x. the superconformal point itself corresponds to
p (x) = xn, and there are n  1 deformations given by
n2xi=0

p (x) = xn +

gixi

where the gi correspond to expectation value of elds for i < (n  2)/2 and to dual mass
parameters for i > (n  2)/2 [21]. eq.(2.2) gives the central charge

and (2.5) gives the dimensions

c = 1 

2
n

[gi] =

2(1  i/n)
1 + 2/n

=

2(n  i)
n + 2

(i = 0..n2)

in agreement with the result of [22].

we are interested in studying type iib strings in the presence of such singularities. in

particular, we would like to study the bps states in this theory near the superconformal

point and how their spectrum jumps as we change the parameters gi in the polynomial
p (x).

the bps states in this case correspond to d3branes wrapped around supersymmetric

3-cycles. a basis of vanishing 3-cycles (not necessarily supersymmetric) can be chosen to
be n1 3-spheres intersecting one another according to the dynkin diagram of an1. the
intersection of two cycles can be interpreted as the skew symmetric form in the product of
electric and magnetic charges. in particular, two s3s corresponding to adjacent nodes of
an1 carry, in some basis, electric versus magnetic charge.

to nd the supersymmetric 3-cycles, one follows the strategy in [13] and considers the
3-cycle as a 3-sphere consisting of an s2 bered over a real curve in the x-plane. the s2
above a given x is y2 + z2 + w2 = p (x) (in an appropriate real subspace). the projection

8

of the 3-cycle onto the x-plane is a curve in the x-plane which begins and ends at zeroes of
p (x). at the endpoints of the curve, which correspond to the poles of s3, the radius of
the s2 in the ber goes to zero. a basis of 3-cycles (not necessarily supersymmetric) can
be chosen to correspond to n  1 intervals connecting the n zeroes of p (x) in a sequence.
these would correspond to a set of 3-cycles whose intersection gives the dynkin diagram
of an1.

as discussed in [15] the condition of having a supersymmetric cycle gets translated in

the x-plane into the existence paths beginning and ending at the zeroes of p (x) such that

the phase of

is constant along the path. this would guarantee in particular that the bps inequality

(4.2)

zs2
 =pp (x) dx
zs3 ||  |zs3

|

is saturated. alternatively, the required condition is that the image of the path under the

jacobian map with respect to the reduced oneform should be a straight line in the at

w -plane, that is,

w (x(t)) =z x(t)

x0 pp (x) dx = t

(4.3)

where t is real parameterizing the path and  is a phase. in this case, the mass of a d3

brane wrapped around the supersymmetric cycle corresponding to such a path between
zeros at x0 and x1 automatically saturates the bps inequality

m =z x1

an ecient technique to nd such paths is to solve the rstorder dierential equation

for solutions x(t) beginning and ending at roots of p (x), for all possible values of the phase

of . this is equivalent to nding integral curves of the vector eld

pp (x)

that start and end at roots of p . as we have explained, the existence or nonexistence of

such a curve then implies the existence or nonexistence of a particular bps state. this

procedure is easily implemented.

in the next section we analyze the solutions to the condition (4.3) in various regimes

of parameters.

9

5. finding the bps states

as we have discussed, we need to nd solutions to

dx
dt

=



pp (x)

(5.1)

where t is a real parameter and  is a phase. moreover the solution should begin and end

at one of the n roots of p (x). we need to establish a few facts:

for each topology of path between two roots of p (x),  is uniquely xed (up to an

overall sign). by topology of path we mean a homology class of paths with xed endpoints

on the complex x-plane with all the roots of p (x) deleted. to see the uniqueness of  note

that for each path  in a particular homology class the integral

z

dxpp (x) = a.

(5.2)

which is well dened up to an overall sign, is independent of the precise choice of  in

that class. this is because two dierent paths in the same class will dier by integral of

an analytic expression in the region bounded by the two curves. physically, this is simply

the reection of the fact that each choice of path topology xes the electric and magnetic

charges of the bps state and the integral (5.2) is just the central charge of the n = 2

algebra in that sector. it follows that  is uniquely xed for each choice of class of path

to be

 = a/|a|.

the next fact we need to establish is that there is at most one solution connecting two

roots. we rst show that there cannot be two dierent solutions in the same path class.

let us rst analyze the structure of the solution to (5.1) near each root. near a root of

p (x), which with no loss of generality we take to be at x = 0, one is solving an equation

which can be approximated as

whose solutions are given by

dx
dt

=


x

x = ( 3

2 t)

in particular, for a given  there are three solutions near x = 0 which make 120 angles
relative to one another, corresponding to the 3 possible choices of cube roots of 2 in this

solution. a typical set of integral curves near to a root is depicted in figure 1.

10

fig.1: a typical set of integral curves near to a root.

now suppose there are two solutions in a given class (and thus with the same choice

of ) connecting two roots of p .

in other words, let us assume that two of the three

integral curves from one root join with two of the three integral curves from another root

(see figure 2a). the geometry should be as depicted in figure 2a: rst, the paths cannot

intersect each other except at the two ends, as the vector eld has a well dened direction

at each point and that would not be the case at an intersection point. secondly, the paths
must make an angle of 120 on each side, otherwise the third integral curve emanating
from either of the roots would have nowhere to go. (we can also rule out the case where
all three curves are joined, by applying this argument to two of the curves making 120
angles relative to each other.) from the geometry of figure 2a it is clear that there will

necessarily be closed integral curves trapped inside. if we consider the winding of the phase

dened by

 = |pp (x)|/pp (x)
2iz d log 

w =

1

we see that w = +1 along these curves. since p (x) has no zeroes or poles inside this curve,

this is impossible. we could also have chosen, instead of the trapped integral curve, an

arbitrary interior curve to use for counting the winding of the phase . for example we

can make the choice shown in figure 2b. in this case we again get winding number +1,

with the two small arcs near the roots each contributing +1/6 to the winding number and

the remaining pieces along the integral curves giving a net winding of +2/3.

roots. the winding of the phase is calculated by integrating along the dashed line.

now let us also establish that there can not be two solutions between two roots, even

if the paths are in dierent topological classes. in such a case the two paths correspond
to solutions to (5.1) with two dierent phases 1 and 2. let  = 11

other words for any special values of  we can change the coecients of p (x) so that the

two central charges have innitesimally dierent phase ratios). let us consider the winding

of the phase (x) along the closed path shown in figure 3. we will rst assume, as in

figure 3, that the two curves do not intersect except at the endpoints. this assumption

will be justied shortly.

this closed path consists of the two integral curves and the small paths connecting them

near the roots. even though the two integral curves are for dierent choices of , in either

case  is a constant and does not vary over the path. in particular the integral r d log 

along the two integral curves is the same as winding of the velocity vector, and gives a total

contribution to the winding of +2/3. along the arcs near each of the roots, the contribution
to the winding will be given by 1/6 up to a correction by /6 at one endpoint and /6
at the other endpoint, which cancel out. we thus still obtain a net winding of +1 unit.
however this is impossible as the winding associated with 1/p is in general negative and
given by m/2 where m denotes the number of roots of p inside the closed curve. the
reason for this is that 1/x  a has a winding number 1/2 around x = a. (the other

possible geometries for these two integral curves curves  in which their relative angle of
approach to one of the endpoints is shifted by 2/3  lead to similar contradictions.)

we also need to justify our assumption that the curves do not intersect each other

except at the endpoints. suppose they did. pick an endpoint and consider the closed curve

that forms between it and the rst point where the two integral curves intersect (figure

4). the winding number around that closed curve is again the sum of contributions of the

two integral curves and the small arcs near the sharp ends. the integral curves contribute
the sum of the two angles divided by 2, or 1
6 (1 + ),
and the right endpoint adds nothing. so the net winding number 1
2  is not even an
integer, as  can be assumed to be a generic phase. this is clearly a contradiction with
the fact that the winding should be m/2 for some integer m.

minimum number of bps states: we can also argue that any pair of roots are con-

nected by a sequence of bps solutions. we can nd such a sequence by minimizing

13

r |pp (x)dx| over arbitrary paths beginning at one root and ending on the other. clearly

there will be a solution to the minimization condition (paths going to innity will give an

innite contribution to the above integral). consider the path which minimizes it. then

for a generic point on this path, away from the roots of p , the curve should satisfy (5.1).

if not, x two nearby points on the curve and take a solution of (5.1) between these two

points. this will have a lower value for the integral, violating the assumption that we had

found the curve which minimizes the integral. in general, this minimal curve may pass

through some roots of p . the above argument still shows that piecewise, between the

roots, it should satisfy (5.1) for some . this implies that any two roots are connected

by a sequence of bps solutions. if there are n roots in all, the minimum number of bps
solutions is thus n1.

jumping phenomena: consider three roots of p labeled by 1, 2, and 3. suppose for

some choice of parameters there are bps solutions from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, and from 1 to

3. a priori, the phase of the central charge of the n = 2 algebra, which determines the

phase , will be dierent for the three dierent solitons. however, let us assume that as

we change the parameters the phases become the same, i.e., the bps charges from 1 to

2 and 2 to 3 get aligned and sum up to the charge from 1 to 3. this means that for the

same choice of , i.e. 12 = 23 = 13, we have three integral solutions. in such a case the

curve from 1 to 3 must coincide with the concatenation of the curves from 1 to 2 and 2 to

14

3. if not, as in the previous arguments, by considering the trapped integral curves inside

we would get a contradiction with the winding number. at the alignment point the angle

 = d123

which gives the angle between the solitons 12 and 23 is 120 degrees. however as we

change parameters from one side to the other side the angle changes from less than to
greater than 120. we will argue below that the case where the 13 soliton does exist
corresponds to when  < 120). first, we argue that the 13 soliton should disappear
when  > 120. if the 13 solution continued to exist, the case before (when  < 120)
and after ( > 120) the transition should look like that depicted in figures 5a and 5b.
this is because the phase of 12/13 should go from one sign to another, which implies, by
looking at integral curves near the point 1, that the 13 curve is to one side or the other

of the 12 curve. but the curve 13 depicted in figure 5b is forbidden: the third integral

curve emanating from point 2 would intersect it, which is not allowed. we thus see that

the soliton represented by the 13 curve decays to 12 and 23 soliton as we pass through

alignment.

the reverse of this argument can also be made. suppose we originally have no soliton

from 1 to 3. let us choose parameters such that we are close to an aligned conguration,
which as argued should correspond to  = 120. then we argue that as we decrease  a
soliton should appear from 1 to 3. to see this note, as we discussed already, that there

15

is a solution which minimizes the integral r |p dx| between any pairs of point. apply

this to points 1 and 3. at the alignment point the minimal solution is given by the sum
of the curves 12 and 23. if  is decreased to less than 120 the class minimizing it is
no longer sum of the 12 and 23 curves. the integral can be decreased, for example by

considering a path such as the one shown in figure 6: we pick two points a and b, on 12

and 23 curves respectively, near root 2. we consider a solution of the integral curves ab
of the vector eld which interpolates between a and b for some . that this is possible is

guaranteed if  < 120. then the integral r |p dx| is decreased if for the part near point

2, the curve ab is used, instead of the radial lines connecting a and b to point 2. thus
the minimum does not coincide with the sum of the 12 and 23 curves, and there appears

a distinct 13 soliton as in figure 5. the local analysis here is similar to what joyce has
considered in the context of 3-cycles on calabiyau [23] 4.

to summarize, whenever the phases of 3 such bps charges are equal, we are in a

situation of marginal stability. under a perturbation away from alignment in one direction,

all 3 states will be stable, but in the other direction, one of the states will become unstable

to decay into the other two states.

5.1. examples

in this part we show that with suitable choices of p (x) we can have any number of
solutions between n  1 and n(n  1)/2. that n  1 is the minimum possible number has
already been noted. also that n(n  1)/2 is the maximum number follows from the fact
that there is at most one bps state for each pair of roots of p . we will show that, for
example, with p (x) = xn  1 we get n(n  1)/2 solitons, one for each pair of roots of p .
on the other hand with p (x) having only real roots, we show that p has exactly n  1
solitons, corresponding to the solitons connecting adjacent roots. by our discussion about

the jumping phenomenon, it follows that as we continuously change the polynomial p (x)

we get arbitrary number of solitons anywhere between these two bounds. in this way the
story is very similar to that of the an series for n = 2 lg theories in 2 dimensions 5.

let us rst focus on the simplest nontrivial an singularity, with p (x) = x3, corre-
sponding to the original su(3) argyresdouglas point [6]. by the above arguments, the

4 we would like to thank m. douglas for pointing this reference out to us. see also [24] [25].
5 in fact if we consider a degenerate choice of polynomial, where p = (dw/dx)2 the problem
of solving (5.1) is identical to the problem of nding solutions to 2d solitons in an n = 2 theory

with lg potential given by w .

16

minimum possible number of bps states is n  1 = 2, and the maximum is 3. a general
deformation of p (x)

p (x) = x3 + ux + v

involves two parameters u and v, with v an operator expectation value and u a mass

parameter. as we shall describe, the stable bps spectrum near the singularity depends

on the direction of approach, and the marginal stability surfaces (msss) extend all the
way down to the critical point. by tuning the dimensionless ratio u3/v2 appropriately as

the scaling is performed, we may end up with either two or three light stable bps states.

(this modies the result of [7], which found three states.) we will now exhibit examples

in which each of these possibilities is realized.

first consider a situation where all three roots are arranged symmetrically, at cube
roots of unity times a common scale factor, so that p (x) = x3  1. given any integral
curve linking two roots at some value of , we can construct two others, linking the other

two pairs of roots, by multiplying  and x by an appropriate cube root of unity (which

preserves p (x) and the form of eq.(4.3)). hence, the total number of integral curves must

be at least 3. since the total number of such curves must also be either 2 or 3, this

maximally symmetric conguration of roots leads to exactly 3 stable bps states.

as another example, suppose the roots are all colinear; without loss of generality, we

may suppose that

p (x) = x(x  1)(x  )

(5.3)

where  is real. we claim that there are exactly two integral curves for all  > 1. by
symmetry, all integral curves must either be at  = 1 or  = i, and must lie along
the real axis. otherwise, given an integral curve not satisfying these conditions, we could

construct another inequivalent geodesic between the same two roots, at the conjugate value

of  and along a conjugate path, in contradiction to the general uniqueness argument above.
(note that solutions at  = i and  = i should be considered equivalent; the change in
sign of  simply means that the path is traversed in the opposite direction.) now it is

clear that there can be no integral curve from x = 0 to x = , because it would have to

pass either over or under x = 1, and thus could not lie entirely along the real axis. thus,

there must be exactly two integral curves (since this is the minimum possible), from 0 to

1 (which occurs at  = 1) and from 1 to  (at  = i). these correspond to real and

imaginary 3-spheres in the calabiyau manifold, intersecting transversely at a point.

17

next, consider interpolating between these congurations by holding two of the roots

xed and moving the third root along a line midway between them. we do this by varying
 in eq.(5.3) from 1
2 . we nd numerically that at
2 + i
approximately  = 1
2 + .231i, the number of integral curves jumps from 3 to 2. the curve
of marginal stability in the plane has roughly the appearance shown in figure 7, and is

(5.4)

in each of the regions containing the real axis, the number of stable bps states is 2;

elsewhere in the -plane, there are 3 such states. by a local analysis, it can be shown
that the components of the curve intersect the real axis at angles of 60, and approach
asymptotes also making angles of 60.

fig.7: curves of marginal stability for n = 3.

the general an singularity with p (x) an nth order polynomial may be analyzed by
the same methods. again, when the roots are arranged with zn symmetry, we will show
that the maximum possible number n(n 1)/2 of stable bps states is realized. and when
the roots are colinear, the number of stable bps states is minimized. indeed, in the latter
case, the same argument we gave for n = 3 extends to show that there are precisely n  1
integral curves, connecting the roots in sequence, with  alternating between 1 and i.

on the other hand, suppose that the roots are located at the nth roots of unity,

corresponding to the polynomial

p (x) = xn  1 ,

18

we will now show that there is a unique integral curve connecting any two roots, for a
total of n(n  1)/2 stable hypermultiplet states.

assume for simplicity that n is even. in general, all integral curves of eq.(5.1) for an

nthorder p (x) that extend out to innity in the x-plane must asymptote to one of n + 2

lines of constant phase. this is because, for large x, eq.(5.1) has the asymptotic solution

x(t) = ((n + 2)t)1/(n+2).

as we have discussed, there are exactly 3 integral curves emanating from each root; each

of these must end either at another root or at one of these n + 2 asymptotic innities. we

consider the graph formed by the set of all integral curves starting or ending at a root,

such as the graph shown in figure 8 for the case n = 6 and  = 1.

fig.8: graph of integral curves ending on roots for n = 6 and  = 1.

an important fact, which severely constrains the topologies of allowed graphs of this

type, is that no two integral curves from a single root may approach the same asymptotic

innity. the proof is almost identical to the above argument that no two roots can be joined

19

by two distinct integral curves. if this did happen, we could consider the concatenation of

two integral curves between a given root and a given innity. a small deformation would

produce a curve beginning and ending at the same innity, with net index of +1/2. but

as we have seen, closed curves always lead to indices of 0 or less, a contradiction.

we now argue that, for =1, there are integral curves connecting complexconjugate

nth roots of 1, and all other curves in the graph are unbounded. to see that only conjugate

points can be connected, suppose that two nonconjugate roots xj = exp(2ij/(n+2)) and
xj+k = exp(2i(j+k)/(n+2)), were joined by an integral curve. then complex conjugation
would map this curve into a dierent integral curve, also with =1, between a pair of

roots conjugate to the original pair. by zn symmetry, at other values  = exp(2ik/n),
we obtain n rotated pairs of integral curves. generically, this procedure leads to multiple

geodesics between xj and xj+k, at distinct values of . (a special case, when the original
two roots are related by reection about the imaginary axis, can be ruled out by showing,

as we do below, that integral curves joining such points already exist for  = i.)

next, we need to show that, for  = 1, all conjugate roots are indeed connected
by integral curves. we rst assume that n is even. the roots x = 1 and x = 1 are
special; they are not connected to any other roots, and each of them has 3 integral curves

which must terminate at 3 dierent asymptotic innities, as seen in figure 8. by complex

conjugation symmetry, one of the integral curves from x = 1 lies entirely along the real
axis; the other two are asymptotically parallel to the lines x(t) = exp(2i/(n + 2))t. in
traversing a very large circle clockwise in the xplane, the winding index of any vector

eld dened by (5.1) will be (n + 2)/2. as we traverse the circle clockwise from the point

where the rst integral curve from x = 1 crosses this circle to the point where the third

curve crosses, the index shifts by at least +1. now consider any root connected to its

conjugate; it must also have two unbounded integral curves, which similarly contribute at

least +1/2 winding to the total index. if all conjugate roots are connected, the total index

will be at least (n + 2)/2; if any are not connected, their individual contributions to the

index will be at least +1, and the lower bound on the index will be greater than its actual

value. therefore, for  = 1, all conjugate roots are connected, and we have thus shown
the existence of n
2  1 integral curves of nite length. the graph of integral curves for the

case n = 8 is shown in figure 8.

the same sort of argument holds for each  which is an nth root of 1. in each of the
n/2 cases (i.e., not distinguishing between  and ), we can exploit the symmetry about
the line t to obtain n
2  1) distinct cases. we can

2  1 integral curves, for a total of n

2 ( n

20

also make use of the symmetry about the line t when  is a (2n)th root of 1; this gives
an additional ( n
2 )2 integral curves, for a total of n(n  1)/2. finally, if n is odd, a similar
counting scheme works: each nth root of 1 corresponds to a distinct symmetry axis, and
each such value of  leads to (n  1)/2 integral curves, for a grand total of n(n  1)/2.
