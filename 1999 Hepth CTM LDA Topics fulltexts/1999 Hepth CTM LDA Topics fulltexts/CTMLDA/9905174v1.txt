abstract

we calculate the leading term in the low-energy absorption cross section for an ar-
bitrary partial wave of the dilaton eld by a stack of many coincident d3-branes. we
nd that it precisely reproduces the semiclassical absorption cross section of a 3-brane
geometry, including all numerical factors. the crucial ingredient in making the corre-
spondence is the identication of the precise operators on the d3-brane world-volume
which couple to the dilaton eld and all its derivatives. the needed operators are
related through t-duality and the iia/m-theory correspondence to the recently de-
termined m(atrix) theory expressions for multipole moments of the 11d supercurrent.
these operators have a characteristic symmetrized trace structure which plays a key
combinatorial role in the analysis for the higher partial waves. the results presented
here give new evidence for an innite family of non-renormalization theorems which
are believed to exist for two-point functions in n = 4 gauge theory in four dimensions.

1 introduction

black p-brane solutions of type ii supergravity carrying ramond-ramond (rr) charges have
been known since the early 90s [1, 2]. the string frame metric and dilaton backgrounds in
such solutions may be expressed in the following simple form:

ds2 = h  1

where

e = h (3p)/4(r) ,

h(r) = 1 +

r7p
r7p .

the importance of these solutions was not fully appreciated until polchinski realized that the
dirichlet p-brane is the elementary object in string theory that couples to the (p + 1)-form
rr potential [3]. this made it clear that the p-brane solutions of [1] describe the classical
elds created by a large number of coincident dp-branes. since the low-energy world-volume
dynamics of n parallel dp-branes is governed by maximally supersymmetric u(n) gauge
theory [4], this suggests a relation between such a gauge theory in p + 1 dimensions and type
ii string theory in the background of the classical p-brane solution.

among early hints that this relationship between supersymmetric gauge theory and string
theory is exact was the calculation of the dilaton absorption cross section by threebranes [5].1
the threebrane solution is of particular interest because it is the only non-singular solution
of the form (1). furthermore, the low-energy dynamics of coincident d3-branes is described
by n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory, which is an attractive theory because of its
exact conformal invariance. a related fact is that the dilaton background is constant, so
that the dilaton uctuation satises the minimally coupled scalar equation

(cid:16)gg(cid:17) = 0 .

(2)

in [5] this equation was solved for incident s-waves of low-energy . the leading term in the
absorption cross section was calculated to be

su gra =

3r8 .

(3)

this result was compared to a corresponding calculation in the sym theory, where the
dilaton couples to the operator t3
4 tr (f 2 +   ) (t3 is the d3-brane tension). at weak
coupling the leading order absorption process is for the dilaton to turn into a pair of gluons

1this calculation was in turn motivated by similar calculations in the d1-d5 system [6, 7, 8]. there
such studies are more dicult, however, due to the complexity of the world volume dynamics of intersecting
d-branes.

on the world-volume. the rate for this process was calculated in the 3-brane gauge theory
and was found to be [5]

remarkably, this is equal to (3) after we take into account the relation

 =

23n 2

32

,

r4 =


25/2 n ,

(4)

(5)

which can be found by equating the tensions of the black 3-brane and n d3-branes [9].
this equality of the low-energy cross sections raises the hope of an exact relation between
sym theory and gravity. there seems to be a puzzle, however, because the gravitational
calculation becomes reliable in the weak curvature limit where g2
ymn   while the sym
calculation was carried out to leading order in g2
ymn. in [10] this puzzle was resolved by
arguing that all higher order corrections in the coupling vanish due to supersymmetric non-
renormalization theorems. (this theorem was made explicit for the absorption cross section
of gravitons calculated in [11], which is related to the 2-point function of the stress-energy
tensor of the gauge theory.) thus, the agreement of s-wave cross sections found in [5, 11] is
actually necessary if sym theory and gravity are exactly related. this agreement is one of
the pieces of evidence in favor of the exact ads/cft correspondence between the threebrane
throat and the n = 4 sym theory formulated in [12, 13, 14].

an immediate question is whether this agreement persists for the absorption of higher
partial waves. in [5] it was suggested that the operator responsible for absorption of the lth
partial wave of the dilaton should be of the form

t3
4l!

tr (fabf abx (i1    x il))traceless .

(6)

it is not hard to show that the operator (6) leads to a sym cross section which scales in
the same way with respect to n and  as the cross section computed from the semiclassical
gravity theory [5]. in [11] an attempt was made to compare the constant factors in these
cross sections, but the results seemed discouraging: the sym answer seemed to grow with l
much faster than the gravity answer.

in this paper we resolve this problem and show that the gravity and the sym cross
sections are in exact agreement for all l. this is the rst example of such a match occurring for
all partial waves. higher partial wave absorption processes were considered for the d1 + d5
system in [15, 16, 17]; because the world-volume theory of the branes is not as well understood
in that case, however, it is not yet possible to make a precise numerical comparison between
the supergravity and d-brane predictions for the absorption cross section.

in order to do an exact absorption calculation in the d3-brane gauge theory we need
to know the precise operators in the world-volume super yang-mills theory which couple
linearly to the bulk dilaton eld and its derivatives. these operators will contain terms of
the form (6), but this is not a complete description of the operators we need. there is an
ordering ambiguity in (6) when n > 1. there are also additional fermion terms which must

2

be considered for l > 0. analogous operators to those we need were recently computed
in [18], where recent results on the m(atrix) theory form of the supercurrent in dlcq m-
theory [19, 20, 21] were used to nd the operators in the world volume theory of a system
of d0-branes coupling to weak iia background elds. by t-dualizing the results of [18] in
three directions, we can determine the desired d3-brane operators and use them to precisely
compute the absorption cross sections. let us consider the l = 1 partial wave as an example.
in [11] it was claimed that the operator t3
4 tr fabf abx i gives a sym absorption cross section
which agrees with the classical result. we have found, however, that when ordering eects
are taken into consideration this term accounts for only 1/2 of the classical absorption cross
section for the leading terms in a large n expansion. luckily, the results in [18] indicate
that there is another operator contributing at the same order:

t3
16

tr (fjk [jki]  fab [abi]) ,

(7)

where f,  and the matrices  are written in 10d notation with a, b  {0, 1, 2, 3} and
i, j, k  {4, . . . , 9}. this operator accounts for the other half of the classical cross section
and restores the agreement for the l = 1 partial wave.

for l > 1, a two-fermion operator of the form of (7) must again be included in the
cross section calculation. in addition, there are quartic terms in the fermions which appear
at l = 2. although the four-fermion terms in the relevant d0-brane and matrix theory
operators have not been calculated, it is possible to x these terms by using supersymmetry
and our knowledge of the bosonic terms. the operators we need are essentially the same
ones that correspond to kaluza-klein modes of the dilaton in the correspondence between
ads5  s5 and n = 4 sym theory, and can be found by acting with 4 supercharges on the
superconformal chiral primary elds

ocp
(l+2)  tr (x (i1 . . . x il+2))traceless .

(8)

since we only act with 4 supersymmetry transformations, we encounter at most 4 fermion
elds. from our knowledge of the bosonic and two-fermion components of the operators, it
is possible to nd the proper combination of supersymmetry operators which give the unique
four-fermion extension of the lower order components compatible with supersymmetry.

a key feature of the operators found in the study of matrix theory supercurrents is the
symmetrized trace structure which dictates that all traces should be averaged over orderings
of the n  n matrices f , x i,  and d. it was suggested some time ago by tseytlin
[22] that the symmetrized trace is the correct way to extend the abelian born-infeld action
to a nonabelian theory. while for the full nonabelian born-infeld action this remains a
conjecture, we emphasize that for the operators we are interested in here this structure has
been deduced from an explicit calculation in the matrix theory context. as further evidence
for this structure, in [18] it was shown that the symmetrized trace gives rise to nontrivial
combinatorial factors which allow the d0-brane action in weakly curved backgrounds to
satisfy the geodesic length condition suggested by douglas in [23].
in the present paper

3

we nd that the symmetrized trace structure and the correct counting of graphs according
to t hoofts large n limit are crucial in achieving exact agreement between the d-brane
absorption calculation and the semiclassical results for l > 0.

in section 2 we review the semiclassical calculation of the higher partial wave absorp-
tion cross sections originally found in [11]. the complete construction of the world-volume
operators in the d3-brane theory is presented in section 3. in section 4 we calculate the
2-point functions of these operators to leading order in g2
ymn and convert these results into
absorption cross sections, nding exact agreement with the semiclassical calculations for all
l. since the semiclassical calculations are valid for g2
ymn  , this is evidence in favor of
non-renormalization theorems protecting the 2-point functions of all operators constructed
in section 3. in section 5 we present a discussion of our results and conclude.

2 semiclassical absorption calculation

in this section we review the semiclassical calculation of the absorption cross section for an
arbitrary partial wave of the dilaton in the extremal 3-brane background. the results of this
calculation were originally given in [11].

the semiclassical approach to computing the absorption cross section for a eld propa-
gating in a black hole background geometry was pioneered in the thesis of unruh [24]. in
recent times, this method has been used to study the absorption cross section for elds in
the 5d black hole geometry produced by a d1 + d5 system [7, 8] and in the 7d black hole
geometry produced by multiple d3-branes [5, 11]. the rst step in a calculation of this type
is to determine the eld equation for a xed partial wave of the eld of interest. this wave
equation can usually be solved approximately in certain regimes of the radial parameter
r. these approximate solutions are then matched between regions and a solution is chosen
which satises the boundary condition that there is no outgoing ux at the horizon. the
absorption coecient is then given by the ratio of the inward ux at the horizon over the
inward ux at r = . application of the standard optical theorem from quantum mechanics
gives the absorption cross section in terms of the absorption coecient. it is often necessary
to obtain approximate solutions in three distinct regions of the parameter r. a particularly
nice feature of the minimally coupled scalars in the 3-brane background is that only two
regions are necessary, which simplies some aspects of the story.

we now outline the application of this method to the dilaton in the 3-brane background,
following [5, 11]. the wave equation for the lth partial wave of a dilaton mode with frequency
 in the background (1) with p = 3 is

where  = r. the absorption process we are interested in thus corresponds to quantum
mechanical tunneling through a centrifugal potential barrier in the reduced one-dimensional

4

system. in both the large  (  (r)2) and small  (  1) regimes, (9) reduces to a
bessel equation. the solution for large  is

(l)() = a2jl+2() + b2nl+2()

where a, b are undetermined constants. the solution in the regime   1 is

(l)() = i(r)42"jl+2  2r2

(10)

(11)

where the overall normalization has been xed to an arbitrary constant and the relative
coecients jl+2 + inl+2 are xed by the condition that the ux at   0 describes a purely
incoming wave. in the overlap region (r)2    1 we can use the asymptotic forms for
the bessel function to nd from (11)

this determines the coecients a, b in (10) to be

a =

the absorption coecient is then given by the ratio of the incoming ux at  = 0 over the
incoming ux at  =

the absorption coecient through [17]

s to

l
s =

82
35 (l + 1)(l + 2)2(l + 3)pl.

(13)

combining this with (12) we nd that the semiclassical result for the leading order contri-
bution to the total absorption cross section is

s =

(14)

(15)

the semiclassical result (15) is the leading term in the absorption cross section for an
arbitrary partial wave l; this is the result which we will reproduce from the d-brane point
of view in the remainder of the paper. although the method we have just outlined gives the

5

correct answer at leading order in r for each partial wave l, there are subleading corrections
to this result which may also be of interest. these subleading corrections were determined
by gubser and hashimoto in [25]. in that paper, it is shown that the wave equation (9) is
equivalent to mathieus modied dierential equation

" 
z2 + 2q cosh 2z  a# (z) = 0.

the exact solution of this equation is known as a power series in q = r. this exact
solution is used in [25] to write the complete expansion for the absorption probability of the
lth partial wave

where bn,k are computable coecients with b0,0 = 1 and ln  is eulers constant. in the nal
section of this paper we briey discuss the possibility of extending the results in this paper
to include some of these higher order corrections.

3 coupling of the dilaton to the world volume theory

in this section we determine how the type iib dilaton eld couples to the world-volume
theory on the branes.

the world volume theory of n d3 branes is the d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-
mills theory with gauge group u(n). this theory may be obtained as the dimensional
reduction of d = 10 super yang-mills theory, and throughout this work, we will use d = 10
language, writing operators in terms of 32 component majorana-weyl spinors and 32  32
gamma matrices. from a four dimensional perspective, these gamma matrices contain not
only the four d = 4 gamma matrices, but also clebsch-gordon coecients relating the 6
representation of the r symmetry group su(4) (equivalent to the fundamental representation
of the so(6) manifest in the d = 10 language) to the representation 44 carried by a fermion
bilinear in the d = 4 language.

the coupling of the type iib dilaton eld to the world volume theory of n d3 branes is in
principle given by the non-abelian born-infeld action which sums all planar string diagrams
describing interactions between the lightest string elds on the d-brane world-volume and in
the bulk. the complete form of this action is not known, although it has been proposed that
the background independent bosonic terms are those obtained by t-duality from a 9-brane
action obtained from the abelian version by symmetrizing all traces [22]. for the purposes
of this paper we only require terms linear in a weak background supergravity eld. such
terms have recently been found in [18] for a system of many d0-branes in a weak background
eld. the result for d0-branes is derived using a proposal for the linear terms in the general
background matrix theory action motivated by the structure of the linearized supergravity
currents in matrix theory [20, 21].

6

the results of [18] can be carried over to the d3-brane system by t-dualizing on a 3-torus
and taking the limit of innite torus volume in the iib theory. for the case of the dilaton
eld, the complete set of couplings is given by [26]

where t (l1ln) are t-dualized versions of the matrix theory expressions for the multipole
moments of the d = 11 dlcq supergravity stress-energy tensor that were shown to appear
coupled to the background metric in the action for matrix theory in a general background.
here, the index a runs from 1 to 3 while the remaining indices are so(6) indices running
from 4 to 9. explicit expressions for the t s were determined in [20, 18] by comparing the
one-loop matrix theory interaction potential between two arbitrary objects with the tree
level supergravity result. using those results, we may write 2

here str denotes an average of all possible orderings of the expressions f , x,  and d
in the trace. the terms al1ln
are a set of additional terms involving fermion elds which
appear for n > 0. for n = 1, the explicit expression may be determined from the results of
[18] and is

f

str (fab [abl]  fij [ijl])

the terms for n > 1 could be determined by extending the matrix theory calculation in [18]
to higher orders in 1/r, but we will determine them more eciently below from the purely
bosonic terms using supersymmetry and a connection to the ads/cft correspondence.

for a dilaton eld (xa, xi), the lth partial wave is precisely the part whose expansion
in transverse coordinates xi is in the l index symmetric traceless representation of so(6).
to isolate the terms in the action which couple to a particular dilaton partial wave we may
rearrange the terms in (17) as

s = t3z d4x [{(x, 0)a +

1
12{(i)2(x, 0)}akk + . . .}

2 here and throughout the rest of this work, indices a, b, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3 are world-volume indices on the
brane while i, j, . . . and p, q, . . . are transverse indices running from 4 to 9. also, (i1  in) and [in  in]
denote averaged symmetrization and antisymmetrization respectively. all quantities are to be interpreted
as their dimensional reduction from d = 10, so for example fij  i[x i, x j] and di  i[xi, ].

here, the rst line gives the coupling of the s-wave part of the dilaton, the second line gives
the coupling of the l = 1 part, and so forth. for each l, the leading low-energy cross section
will come only from the terms with l derivatives on , since additional derivatives on  will
result in additional powers of . therefore, we dene operators 3

to determine the remaining fermionic terms in the operators o, we now make a connection
with the ads/cft correspondence for d3 branes.

sl = t3z d4x

in the correspondence between large n d = 4, n = 4 super yang-mills theory and type
iib supergravity on ads5  s5 [12, 13, 14], gauge theory operators corresponding to the
complete spectrum of kaluza-klein modes of the supergravity elds have been found. these
operators lie in short multiplets of the superconformal group and may be obtained by acting
with various combinations of the d = 4 supercharges q and q (up to four of each) on the
chiral primary operators

ocp
n = tr (x p1    x pn)c i1in

p1pn

(19)

in [27, 28] it was conjectured that the gauge theory operators coupling to the various super-
gravity modes may also be determined by expanding the born-infeld action for a d3 brane
about the ads background. in the case of the dilaton eld, apart from some power of r/r,
the operator determined in this way is exactly the same as the operator which couples to
the dilaton in the born-infeld action expanded about at space, since the dilaton does not
mix with any other elds in either picture. hence, the operator we are interested in should
be obtainable by taking a supersymmetry variation on the chiral primary elds above.

more precisely, it may be seen from the analysis in [29] and [30] (the table in [31] is useful
in relating the results in these papers to the 4d theory) that the particle corresponding to the
lth partial wave of the dilaton couples to an operator obtained by applying four supercharges
of the same chirality to the primary operator in (19) with n = l + 2. from the d = 10 point
of view, both q and q are contained in the majorana-weyl supercharge q, so the operator
coupling to the lth partial wave of the dilaton eld is contained in the operator

we use conventions in which the d = 10 supersymmetry transformation rules are4

4we include explicitly the projection operator p = (1 + 11)/2 in terms of which the weyl condition is

the operator we are interested in is a lorentz scalar and a traceless l-index symmetric
tensor of so(6), so our desired operator is actually obtained from the above expression by
contracting the extra indices with a combination of 10d gamma matrices of the form

amn

.

in principle, the linear combinations of terms in (20) in which we are interested can be
determined from group theory, using the results of [29]. these terms can also be isolated by
performing a component expansion of polynomials in superelds as in [32]. we nd it easier
in practice to simply nd a combination of gamma matrices which correctly reproduce the
bosonic and two-fermion terms described above. this is achieved by contracting (20) with 5

which may now be computed to be

terms in the rst line arise from the four supersymmetry generators acting on either one
or two of the xs in (19) and appear for any l. in writing these terms, we have used the
equations of motion, written compactly using d = 10 indices as

d = 0, df = i 

to rewrite terms in a form with no world-volume derivatives acting on f or  (recall that
di  i[x i, ]). terms in the second line result when the qs are spread over three separate
xs and appear for l  1. finally, the four fermion terms come when each supersymmetry
generator acts on a dierent x and therefore appear only for l  2.

for each of the dilaton partial waves, we have now determined the complete form of the
non-abelian operators o which determine the leading term in the low-energy expansion of
the absorption cross section.

5the antisymmetrization in fermion indices is required since we are trying to reproduce the action of four
d = 4 supercharges of like chirality, which anticommute. this restricts to antisymmetric matrices for which
{[]0} form a basis when sandwiched between majorana weyl spinors.

4 world volume absorption

in this section, we use the operator determined in the previous section to calculate the cross
section for absorption of the lth partial wave of the dilaton eld by a set of n coincident
parallel d3 branes.

the most obvious way to proceed, and the method originally used in [5] to show agreement
between the world volume and supergravity approaches for the s-wave absorption, is to treat
the dilaton as a time dependent perturbation in the world-volume theory and calculate the
transition amplitude to each possible set of nal particles on the brane, summing over the
various contributions in the usual way to obtain a cross section. however, as explained in
[10], it turns out that there is a simpler method exploiting the fact that the cross section
arising from a given operator is simply related to the two-point function of that operator on
the brane. for a canonically normalized scalar coupling to the brane through an interaction

s = z d4x(x, 0)o(x)

the precise relation is given by

 =

here,  is the energy of the particle, and

p2=2+i

p2=2i

disc (p)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(22)

(p) = z d4xeipxho(x)o(0)i

which depends only on s = p2. to evaluate (22) we extend  to complex values of s and
compute the discontinuity of  across the real axis at s = 2. this method has the advantage
that it is not necessary to determine all of the distinct nal particle states or sum over the
polarizations, which would be rather complicated for large values of n and l.

we now use this method to calculate the absorption cross section for each partial wave
of the dilaton eld. we assume that the dilaton is normally incident on the brane in the 9
direction so that

(x) = ei(x9t)

from (18), we see that the absorption cross section for the lth partial wave is determined by
the two-point function of the operator

ol = t3

l
l! o999

to hol(x)ol(0)i will be an l + 1 loop planar diagram with each eld in the operator at x
contracted with a eld in the operator at 0. we can ignore all contributions from operators

propagators

to evaluate the two-point functions at leading order, all we need to know are the propagators
of the various elds. in d = 10 language, choosing a gauge xing term which enforces the
feynman gauge, the quadratic action which determines the propagators is simply

xed in the rst position by cyclicity of the trace and the other runs over positions 2 through

traces is evaluated by summing over all possible contractions matching the operators in the
rst trace to those in the second trace. however, only those contractions which match up
the operators in reverse cyclic order contribute with the maximal power of n, namely n l+2.
for each of the (l + 1) orderings of operators in the rst trace there will be exactly such 2
contractions with the sum of operators in the second trace.7 all of these contributions are
identical, so the symmetrizations result in a factor 2(l + 1)/(l + 1)2 = 2/(l + 1), and we have

contributions from the other operators, our result is safely less than l
s, so we do not nd
the problem encountered in [11].

two-fermion contribution

we now calculate the two-point function of the two fermion operator o2
to determine
its contribution to the cross section. the calculation is similar to the bosonic two-point
function so we will be brief. we have

here, for each of the l(l + 1) orderings in the rst symmetrized trace, there are two terms in
the second symmetrized trace (related by switching the s) which have the correct ordering
to give a non-vanishing set of contractions with the maximal power of n. again, all con-
tributions are identical, due to the symmetry of c~9
~p and the antisymmetry in the fermionic

9for multiple p s in a trace, as long as they are all separated by an even number of  matrices, we

note that the two sides of this expression are not equal, but equivalent when appearing in
the two-point function above, since we have used the antisymmetry of the index pairs [ab]
and [cd] and the symmetry of index pair (ef ) in order to simplify the trace. inserting this
trace into the expression above and simplifying, we nd that

four fermion contribution

finally, we calculate the contribution to the cross section from the four fermion opera-
tor which appears for l > 1. in this case, the operator o4
has two pieces, so we have to
calculate the two-point function of each of the pieces as well as a cross term. these three
correlators dier only in the indices on the  matrices, so we may write them together as

this time, each of the (l + 1)l(l 1) orderings in the rst symmetrized trace may couple in a

again, the evaluation of the traces is simplied using the fact that the sets of indices (ef gh),
(p1p2), and (q1q2) are symmetric in the expression to which the traces are contracted. the
rest of the evaluation is straightforward and in terms of the bosonic two-point function, we

thus, for all values of l, the total low-energy cross section for absorption of the lth partial
wave of the dilaton by n coincident d3-branes is exactly the same when computed in the
world volume theory as when computed in classical supergravity.

5 conclusions

in this paper we used the world-volume theory of many parallel d3-branes to exactly re-
produce the semiclassical absorption cross section of an arbitrary higher partial wave of the
dilaton eld. this is the rst time that such a correspondence has been made precise for
the absorption of higher partial waves by any d-brane black hole conguration. this result
provides additional evidence for the conjectured exact correspondence between the world-
volume theory of n d3-branes and type iib string theory on ads5  s5 [12, 13, 14]. the
fact that arbitrary partial waves on the sphere s5 are accurately described in the d-brane
gauge theory suggests a number of interesting directions for further research. in particular,
these results indicate that incoming wave packets of the supergravity elds can be localized
on the sphere in the asymptotic regime. it would be interesting to study in more detail the
behavior of such localized wave packets in the d-brane gauge theory.

in performing the calculation in this paper, it was necessary to have an exact formulation
of the coupling of the d-brane world-volume elds to the background supergravity elds. we
were able to precisely x the operators on the d3-brane world-volume which couple linearly to
derivatives of the background dilaton eld by utilizing recent results for similar operators in
m(atrix) theory and the related d0-brane theory in type iia. it has been suggested in various
contexts that the ads/cft correspondence and the m-theory/matrix correspondence are
in some sense equivalent [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. the fact that similar operator structures
appear coupling to background elds in the two theories may help to make this relationship
more precise. certainly, the symmetrized trace structure which appears in the supergravity
operators found in [19, 20, 18] plays a key combinatorial role in exact calculations in both
theories, as seen in [26] and the present paper. a fruitful direction for further progress may
be to use results from one of these correspondences in deriving new information about the
other, as we have here used matrix theory results to obtain new information in the d3-brane
context.

the exact correspondence between the semiclassical gravity calculation, which we expect
to be valid for large g2
y m n, and the super yang-mills calculation, which is an expansion to
leading order in g2
y mn, indicates that there is a non-renormalization theorem for the two-
point functions of all the operators ol coupling to lth partial waves of the dilaton. such
a non-renormalization theorem was proven in [10] for the two-point function of the stress
tensor, and in [39] for the two-point function of the r-symmetry current. these operators lie
in the same p = 2 representation of the superconformal algebra su(2, 2|4) as the operator o0
corresponding to the s-wave of the dilaton. from general arguments based on supersymmetry
[40] it is believed that all two-point functions of operators in this representation are related by

16

supersymmetry so that the non-renormalization of the s-wave absorption amplitude is implied
by the non-renormalization theorems proven in [10, 39]. for the operators coupling to the
higher partial waves there is as yet no analogous non-renormalization theorem, although it is
widely believed that all two and three-point functions of operators in short representations
of the superconformal algebra are protected by non-renormalization theorems. evidence for
such non-renormalization theorems was given in [41], where it was shown that the free eld
calculation of the 3-point functions of the chiral primary operators ocp
in (19) agrees with
the predictions of supergravity through the ads/cft correspondence. this calculation was
somewhat dierent in spirit from ours, though, because in [41] the overall normalization
of operators was left undetermined and only appropriate ratios of correlators were shown
to agree between weak and strong coupling. the advantage of using the absorption cross
sections to calculate two-point functions is that the overall normalization of operators is
completely xed by comparing the coupling of the throat region of the threebrane geometry
to the bulk region and the corresponding coupling of the d3-branes to the bulk elds.

p

perturbative evidence for the non-renormalization theorems was given in [42], where it
was shown that the rst perturbative correction to the two- and three-point functions of all
the chiral primaries vanishes for all p. we expect similar results to hold for the descendant
operators that we have constructed.
in such calculations it will be important to use the
complete vertex operators (21), including the parts that contain more than 2 + l elds. our
results provide a strong piece of evidence for the existence of non-renormalization theorems
for two-point functions; it would be very nice, however, to have a more direct demonstration
of these theorems and a better understanding of why they occur.

the existence of an innite family of non-renormalization theorems for the two-point
functions of short operators in the 4d super yang-mills theory seems to be related to a sim-
ilar innite family of non-renormalization theorems in the one-dimensional matrix quantum
mechanics theory underlying matrix theory. one piece of evidence for the conjecture that
matrix theory describes light-front supergravity is the agreement between the leading v4/r7
term in the 1d super yang-mills eective potential describing the interaction between a pair
of d0-branes and the long-range supergravity eective potential between a pair of gravitons
with longitudinal momentum [43, 44]. this agreement arises due to a non-renormalization
theorem in the matrix quantum mechanics theory [45, 46]. in [20, 18] it is shown that all
linearized supergravity interactions are correctly reproduced by one-loop terms in the matrix
quantum mechanics theory, suggesting an innite family of non-renormalization theorems for
terms of the form f 4x l/r7+l. it seems likely that similar non-renormalization theorems occur
in the eective action of the 4d n = 4 gauge theory, generalizing the non-renormalization
theorem proven in [47, 48] for f 4 terms. it is unlikely, though, that there are similar the-
orems for operators involving higher powers of f than f 4 because such operators do not
belong to short multiplets (in the ads/cft correspondence such operators are assumed to
couple to massive string modes). note, however, that at least for the su(2) matrix theory
there appears to be a non-renormalization theorem for the v6 terms [49, 50].

17

just as non-renormalization of two-point functions in the 4d gauge theory seems to cor-
respond with the non-renormalization theorems in matrix theory associated with linearized
gravity interactions, there is evidence for non-renormalization of three-point functions in the
gauge theory [51, 52, 41, 42, 53] as well as for 3-body interactions in matrix theory [50, 54].
a possible explanation for the non-renormalization of 2-point and 3-point functions in the
d = 4 theory is given in [55]. in both the ads/cft and matrix theory contexts, however,
it appears that there are no non-renormalization theorems for four-point interactions. in the
ads/cft correspondence there are corrections to supergravity 4-point functions coming
from explicit o(3) corrections present in the string action [56, 57, 55]. analogous loga-
rithmic corrections have been found in the 4-point functions of the super yang-mills theory
[58]. similarly, it does not seem to be possible to extend the existing matrix theory non-
renormalization theorems to 4-body interactions [59, 60]. in the case of matrix theory, the
absence of such non-renormalization theorems at higher order would imply that agreement
between matrix quantum mechanics and supergravity might only be achieved through sub-
tleties in the large n limit. the suspected non-renormalization theorems for 2- and 3-point
interactions, which are as yet poorly understood, form another interesting point of contact
between matrix theory and the ads/cft correspondence. it may be possible to use the
correspondence we have exploited in this paper between operators in the two theories to
achieve a better understanding of the structure in supersymmetric gauge theory responsible
for these non-renormalization theorems.

in this paper we have only considered the leading term in the absorption cross section
for each partial wave l.
it would be very interesting to study whether any of the higher
order terms in the semiclassical absorption result (16) can be reproduced from the d3-brane
gauge theory. it was suggested in [61] that the nonabelian born-infeld action might give
rise to this entire series of terms. it is argued in [25], however, that string corrections to the
nbi action will be needed to make the correspondence precise beyond leading order. this
would not be too surprising, as we have no reason to believe that the subleading operators
coupling to the higher partial waves of the dilaton will not be renormalized. in the past we
have encountered many surprising agreements, however, so it would be very interesting to
extend the analysis to subleading terms and to see if any further structure of the absorption
cross section can be understood on the d3-brane side.
