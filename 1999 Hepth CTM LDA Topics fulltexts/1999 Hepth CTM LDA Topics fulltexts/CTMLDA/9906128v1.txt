behavior of logarithmic branch cuts in the self-energy of gluons at nite temperature

we give a simple argument for the cancellation of the log(k2) terms (k is the gluon momentum)

between the zero-temperature and the temperature-dependent parts of the thermal self-energy.

there have been many studies of thermal green functions in gauge eld theories [17], which show that their behavior
at nite temperature is rather dierent from the one at zero temperature. in particular, it was recently pointed out by
weldon [8] that in qed, the logarithmic branch cut singularities cancel to one loop-order, in the thermal self-energy
of the electron.

the purpose of this note is to show that in the yang-mills theory, a somewhat similar behavior occurs in the full
gluon self-energy, which includes nite temperature eects. of course, in this theory, the massless gluons are quite
modied by these eects and the gluon propagator requires the braaten-pisarski resummation. nevertheless, it is
interesting to remark that, even before such a procedure is carried out, the one-loop log(k2) terms cancel in the sum
of the t = 0 and the t 6= 0 contributions to the gluon self-energy. as we shall see, this happens because the log(k2)
terms appear in the thermal part of the self-energy only in the combination log(k2/t 2). but one can show that
the log(t 2) contributions have the same structure as the ultraviolet divergent terms which occur at zero temperature
[9]. consequently, the log(k2/t 2) terms combine directly with the log(k2/2) contributions which occur at t = 0
( is the renormalization scale), so that the log(k2) terms cancel in a simple way in the thermal self-energy of the
gluon. the branch cut in the log(k2) contribution at t = 0 is associated with the imaginary part of the self-energy,
which gives the rate of decay of a time-like virtual gluon into two real gluons. although this contribution cancels at
t 6= 0, there appear then additional, temperature-dependent logarithmic branch points. these singularities indicate
processes not available at zero temperature, where particles decay or are created through scattering in the thermal
bath.

to one-loop order, the thermal self-energy of gluons generally depends on three structure functions, t , l and

c [10]

where the projection operators p t,l

i = 0 and kip l



i 6= 0 [6,7]. the non-trnsverse projection operator p c

are transverse with respect to the external four-momentum k and satisfy:
 can be written in the plasma rest frame as

p c

k2 " k

|~k|(cid:0)k0k  0k2(cid:1) +   # .

(2)

although c vanishes at t = 0 because of the slavnov-taylor identity, it is in general a non-vanishing function of
the temperature, so that k 6= 0 for the exact self-energy.
we will discuss here, for deniteness, the retarded thermal self-energy of the gluon, which is obtained by the analytic
continuation k0  k0 + i.(a rather similar analysis can be made in the case of the time-ordered self-energy, following
the approach presented in reference [11]). in order to illustrate in a simple way the mechanism of the cancellation of
the log(k2) contributions, let us rst consider the special case of the feynman gauge, where c vanishes even at
nite temperature. then, t and l can be expressed in the plasma rest frame in terms of linear combinations of

 and 00. after performing the integration over the internal energies q0, 
 and 00 can be written as an integral
over internal on-shell momenta q = (|~q|, ~q), as follows

and

where (x is the cosine of the angle between ~k and ~q).

the two terms in the last square bracket are associated respectively with the t = 0 and the t 6= 0 contributions (n
is the bose-einstein distribution).

in order to express the integrations in (5) in terms of known functions, it is convenient to dene the variable

then it is straightforward to show that

the above form shows that the integrals appearing in the calculation of the gluon self-energy can be naturally expressed
in terms of the quantities k (which are proportional to the light-cone momenta k0  k3, if one chooses, for example,
the third axis along ~k).

using the fact that rek(x) > 0, the |~q| integration of the t 6= 0 part of i0 (where we may set  = 0), yields the result

would simply lead, after performing the |~q| integration in equation (7), to the rst two terms in the exact expression
(10). as far as the log(k) contribution to the t 6= 0 part is concerned, one may eectively replace in eq. (7), for
small |~q|, n (|~q|/t ) by 1/2. consequently, this contribution will cancel the log(k) term associated with the t = 0
part of i0 (this cancellation can also be explicitly veried from eqs. (9) and (10)).

by itself, the k-integration of the log(k/t ) term in eq. (10) gives the contribution

the emergence of the log(k2) term in the special combination log(k2/t 2), is a direct consequence of the fact that
the integrand in eq. (10) depends only on the dimensionless ratio k/t . similarly, the log(k/) term in eq. (9)
yields a contribution which, apart from sign, can be obtained from eq. (12) by the replacement t  . consequently,
the log(k2) terms will cancel between the zero-temperature and the temperature-dependent contributions, leaving a
net factor proportional to log(2/t 2). after calculating the contributions from the rst and third terms in eq. (10),
we obtain the following result for the temperature-dependent part of i0:

next, consider the i1 integral which can be written as:

(13)

(14)

note that the t = 0 contribution, associated with the factor of 1 in the second square bracket, would apparently lead
to a quadratically divergent integral, which however vanishes in the dimensional regularization scheme. on the other
hand, this factor yields a leading thermal contribution which is quadratic in the temperature

the |~q|-integration of the second term in the second square bracket of eq. (14) is identical to the one which occurs in
i0, so that it gives analogous log(k) contributions which cancel between the t = 0 and thermal parts. as we have seen,
only such contributions would give rise, after the k-integration, to individual log(k2) terms. it is possible to evaluate
exactly all other temperature-dependent contributions to i1, in terms of logarithmic functions and of riemanns zeta
functions with arguments (1 + k/t ), which are analytic when k  0 [11]. since the complete expression is rather
involved, we indicate here, for simplicity, only the logarithmic temperature-dependent contributions to i1:

in a general gauge, 

independent). in this case, the thermal contributions to c = k

 and 00 will have a similar behavior (in particular, the leading t 2 contribution is gauge
0 /|~k| are non-vanishing, and can be written as [13]

(17)

where  is the gauge parameter ( = 1 in the feynman gauge) and the derivative d/dq0 acts on all terms at its right.
performing the |~q| integration, the terms involving log(k) factors turn out to be proportional to

however, the coecient of the log(k2) term, which is obtained after the k-integration is performed, actually vanishes:

(19)

thus, the full self-energy of the gluon, which includes the thermal eects, does not contain log(k2) contributions.
essentially, these eects replace the zero-temperature log(k2/2) term by a log(t 2/2) contribution. although this
correspondence seems plausible, it is not so obvious. for instance, it would not hold if the thermal contributions would
0/t 2), log(|~k|2/k2), etc. to discard this possibility, it is necessary to show that the
involve individual terms like log(k2
log(k2) and log(t 2) contributions appear in the thermal part only in the combination log(k2/t 2). furthermore, in
order to explain the cancellation of the log(k2) terms between the zero-temperature and the temperature-dependent
parts, one must also argue [9] that the log(t ) dependence of the self-energy is simply related to its ultraviolet behavior
at zero-temperature. here, these properties of the thermal gluon self-energy have been explicitly veried to one-loop
order.
