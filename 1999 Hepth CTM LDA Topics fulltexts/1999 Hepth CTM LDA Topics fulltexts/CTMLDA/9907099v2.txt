we address the issue of the worldsheet and spacetime covariant formulation for matrix

strings. the problem is solved in the limit of vanishing string coupling. to go beyond the

gs = 0 limit, we propose a topological quantum eld theory as a twisted candidate. our

model involves the generalized octonionic or su (4) instanton equations dened in eight

dimensions for a supersymmetric u (n ) yangmills eld living on a special holonomy

manifold. the question of untwisting this matrix model into an anomaly free theory

enlightens the need for an extended 2dgravity sector, that we suggest could be (partially
twisted) wgravity.

1. introduction

string dualities predict the existence of an eleven-dimensional quantum theory of grav-

itation [1]. so far not much is known about this mysterious mtheory. the rst indication

towards its existence is the fact that type iia superstring theory can be interpreted as

a compactied version of the eleven-dimensional supersymmetric theory with all kaluza
klein states present in the form of d0branes. in a certain energy regime, the d0branes
themselves are well described by the supersymmetric quantum mechanics (sqm) of n  n
matrices with 16 supercharges.

the proposal of [2], further claried by [3], and more recently by [4], was to interpret

mtheory compactied on a light-like circle with n units of momentum along it as the

u (n ) case of such sqm. this proposal is extended for compactications of mtheory
on any tori t d of dimension 0  d  3, with the sqm replaced by the supersymmetric
yangmills theory (sym) on the dual torus ft d with the same gauge group u (n ).

in particular, the case d = 1, expected to be equivalent to type iia superstrings,

produces the (1+1)dimensional sym on a cylinder. r. dijkgraaf, e. and h. verlinde

(dvv) have analyzed this theory in a strong gym coupling regime (weak string coupling gs)

and found that one can view this gauge theory as a perturbation of the orbifold conformal
theory with target (ir8)n /sn [5]. the number 8 here is the number of scalar matrices
x 1, . . . , x 8 in the gauge multiplet. the permutation group sn is the part of the unbroken
gauge group u (n )  u (1)nsn . this description of the gauge theory contains the second
quantized hilbert space of free string theory, as well as the string interactions in the form

of the irrelevant perturbation corresponding to taking the yangmills coupling gym large

but nite.

we wish to address the question of a covariant formulation for this theory of matrix

strings. indeed, in [5], it is formulated as a greenschwarz (gs)like superstring theory,

thus lacking covariance with respect to both worldsheet and spacetime symmetries if writ-

ten in terms of the free elds. is there a way to dene a covariant matrix strings theory,

analogously to that for the u (1) superstrings ? in other words, can one formulate a neveu

schwarzramond (nsr) matrix superstring, that would exhibit manifest worldsheet and

spacetime invariances ?

in the present paper, we discuss several possible steps towards an answer to these

questions.

1

first of all, in the limit gs = 0 the problem has a simple solution. namely, consider n

copies of the elds entering the c = 0 conformal eld theory of the nsr string in the con-
formal gauge: one has the bosons x 
l,r;i, the 2d gravity ghosts
systems: bi, ci, i, i, with  = 0, . . . , 9, i = 1, . . . , n . take as an action for this theory the
sum of n copies of the standard nsr action. we get c = n  0 = 0 superconformal theory.
now consider the orbifold of this theory by the action of the symmetric group sn which
acts on the index i. the theory obtained has the following properties:

i , left and right fermions 

1. when considered on a cylinder, it contains the long strings of [5] in the form of the

twisted sectors;

2. the theory has manifest tendimensional lorentz covariance, acting on the index ;
3. it has wlike chiral algebra, generated by the stress-energy tensor

t =xi

ti

where ti = x 

wl =pi t l

i ,

i + 

i x 
l;i + ghosts   and its higher spin analogues (see [6]):
l = 1, 2, . . . , n . this algebra can be used to show that on the cylinder

l;i

this theory is equivalent to the gs theory of [5].

the problem is to go beyond gs = 0. similarly to the recent attempts of producing

the covariant formulation of superstrings in various backgrounds [7], we shall base our

model on a certain version of topological strings. we propose a version based on the

su (4) instanton equations [8],[9] dimensionally reduced from eight to two dimensions.

the topological eld theory (tqft) that we construct out of these turns out to give a

particular case of type b topological strings. to enforce its 2dcovariance, the system

with eight matrices obtained in this approach, describing transverse non-abelian degrees

of freedom, is coupled to a twodimensional gravity background (a version of the gauged
landau-ginzburg topological system, based on the superpotential w = 1
6 abctra[b, c]
arises). away from the commuting limit gs = 0, there is a further complication from the

dimension of the yangmills coupling gym. to compensate for it, and maintain conformal

invariance still in the context of tqft, we introduce other elds, of the wesszumino

type. this model with eight dimensional target space now serves as a base to our further

steps, concerning spacetime covariance.

in the seek for tendimensional covariance, we want to approach the system with ten

matrices. to this end, we suggest to supersymmetrize the latter tqft: to the dimen-

sionally reduced yangmills eld, we add its eight dimensional supersymmetric partners.

2

in this manner, we end up with the correct number of matrix coordinates for the possi-

ble so(10) covariance, together with additional fermions. the extra elds will eectively

decouple by compensation with the corresponding topological ghosts; but we believe that

they can be used to produce covariant heterotic matrix strings, via a generalization of [10].

we now have all ten coordinates at hand (plus superpartners), part of which describe

unphysical degrees of freedom, naturally leading us to the question of anomalies.

in our approach `a la topological, the anomaly issue arises when one attempts to

untwist the topological symmetry into spacetime supersymmetry. the idea is that the

anomaly induced by untwisting the elds of the matrix strings sector should be canceled by

a countertwist of the elds from another sector, namely some extension of topological 2d

gravity [10]. the latter is to be chosen so as to contribute with an anomaly exactly opposite

to that stemming from untwisting the matter sector: the 2dgravity ghost-systems of the

untwisted theory must compensate for the anomaly carried by matrix matter elds. in

the large gym coupling limit, the single-valued elds of the matrix strings theory (the so-

called long strings) live on an n -sheeted riemann surface [11], with n the dimension of

the cartan-subalgebra of the yangmills group. this suggests that the suitable matrix
extension of 2dgravity could arise from the wn part of partially untwisted topological
w gravity, which we propose as a candidate to the extended 2dgravity sector.

2. generalized instantons and twodimensional covariance

2.1. octonionic or su (4) instantons

our starting point towards the various directions advocated in this paper shall be the

eight-dimensional theories of [8][9], namely twisted versions of the usual eight-dimensional
supersymmetric theory for a yangmills gauge eld a, of curvature f = da+aa, living on
a special holonomy manifold m8. two cases are at hand, according to the type of manifold
that one considers. in the case of spin(7) holonomy, one has octonionic instantons arising

from the generalized self-duality equations

fi8 

1
2

cijkfjk = 0,

for

i, j,   = 1, . . . , 7

(2.1)

in the case of m8 being a calabiyau fourfold (cy4), it is the su (4) instantons one deals
with, obtained from

fza za = 0,
fzazb  abcdfzc zd = 0,

3

for a, b,   = 1, . . . , 4

(2.2)

we shall focus on the latter, most appropriate for dimensional reduction to two dimensions.
viewing the reduction as the splitting m8 = m6   where  is twodimensional and
m6 taken to be small, we are led to split the gauge eld aza=1,...,4 as a  aza=1,...,3 and
az  az4 .

now, the gauge functions (and thus the lagrangian that one constructs using them)

obtained by simplistic reduction of (2.2) from eight to two dimensions are not covariant

in the sense of twodimensional reparametrisations. this is obviously due to the non-

commutativity of the yangmills elds. in order to dene a meaningful twodimensional

theory, we propose to couple our instanton equations to a topological gravity background.

2.2. two-dimensional covariant equations

we will consider our elds propagating on the genus one riemann surface  (com-
plex coordinates z, z) on which we shall require 2dcovariance.1 we introduce the two
dimensional metric g in the beltrami parametrisation, which has the advantage to make
left-right factorization manifest in a conformally invariant way [13][14]:

ds2 = e+

z e

z (dz + z

zdz)(dz + z

zdz)

(2.3)

conformal gauge is restored when one puts the beltrami dierentials z
z to zero. the
symmetries at hand allow to set the conformal factor to 1 (i.e. e+
z are both set to 1).
enforcing all needed twodimensional covariances for the non-abelian part of our equations

z , e

z, z

requires the additional introduction of a pair of background left and right wesszumino
(wz) type elds l and l, for which we impose that el (resp. e l) have (1, 0) (resp. (0, 1))
conformal weight.2

with this minimal set of additional background elds, we can now expect to construct

a 2dcovariant tqft, based on the following 2dconsistent dimensional reduction of (2.2):

1 this surface  should not be confused with the strings world-sheet. it is just an interpolating

surface, as argued in [12]. otherwise we would face an overcounting problem.

2 as will be argued in the following, the l, l elds can possibly be made to propagate and

play the role of compensators in case a conformal anomaly arises after untwisting the model.

4

the derivatives above are covariant with respect to both the gauge eld az, az and the

2d gravity. namely, for the scalars, it reads as follows (whereas for higher order tensors,

it has additional terms involving the christoels):

dz a = [(z + az)  z

z(z + az)]a

(2.5)

2.3. constructing the tqft: twisted lightcone nsr matrix strings

making use of the above preliminaries, we can now construct the twodimensional

tqft, following the paradigm of cohomological eld theory and relying on the eight

dimensional construction of [8]. to do so, we introduce topological ghosts and ghosts of
ghosts for all (dimensionally reduced) components of a. also needed are the antighosts
and lagrange multipliers adapted to the choice of gauge functions. altogether, we shall

deal with the following set of elds and ghosts, all in adjoint representation of the u (n )

gauge group:

z,z



az,z

h





a

;



a

h a
z

a
z,

a

;

a

h a
z

a
z

(2.6)

in each of the above brstmultiplet, the rst line is a classical eld, the second line

is its superpartners (i.e. the topological ghosts and antighosts), the third line contains

the brst transform h of the antighost lagrange multipliers:

it is used to enforce the

topological gauge functions. in the multiplet for az,z there are, in addition, the bosonic

ghosts for ghosts that are responsible for the underlying yangmills symmetries and the
associated fermionic lagrange multiplier .3

the gauge functions imposed to gauge x the topological symmetry for the yang

mills eld are those of (2.4). they are organized into three complex equations plus a

separate real one, and accordingly for the antighosts a
z and . the gauge functions that
one imposes for the topological ghosts z,z, a,a are constructed in a similar manner: they

3 all elds are u (n ) matrices, and the as are all complex. we shall alternatively use the
notations a = a = a, where bar means complex conjugation. the elds  and  have ghost
numbers 2 and 2, respectively and would be more conventionally denoted as 2 =  and
2 = .

to implement 2d covariance:

in a naive formulation, l, l and the beltramis z

where the brst operator s only acts on the elds of the matter sector and not on the

2dgravity background. (the precise form of the operator s on our various elds can be

straightforwardly obtained from that of the eight dimensional operator in [8].) this action

can be interpreted as a twisted version of the light-cone dvv matrix strings, with manifest

invariance under the eightdimensional rotations, via the following correspondence [10] for

bosons:

and fermions:

a, a, ,   x m=18,

a, a,  + , z  m

3. spacetime covariance

3.1. supersymmetrization and tendimensional nsr fields

clearly, the eld content of the construction above cannot allow invariance under

the tendimensional group of rotations. the bosonic sector is based on eightuples of

matrices whereas ten-dimensional invariance would imply two more matrices, describing

the longitudinal degrees of freedom. we propose to get these by replacing the original

set of elds the dimensionally reduced eld content of the eight dimensional yangmills

tqft by that of the supersymmetrization of the same theory.

this means that we shall construct the tqft for the set of fundamental elds en-
larged to the degrees of freedom of the full n = (1, 1), d = 8 yangmills supermultiplet
(a, , ), where  = 1   8 and  = 1   16. all elds are still u (n ) matrices, and

tional topological partners:

we now have ten bosonic matrices to play with: x m =110  {x m, }, as well as ten left

another gain is that we end up with extra fermions from , which can either be decoupled

 , +, } and as many right movers m

  {m

+  {m

or, more interestingly, be used to produce a heterotic matrix string in the same spirit as

that of [10].

3.2. does the supersymmetrized tqft exhibit manifest so(10) invariance ?

the additional part of the tqft for the supersymmetric partners is constructed as

before, namely by gauging their topological symmetry.

for the twisted gaugino , topological freedom and the requirement of quantum
propagation imply that we introduce a chirality choice; we choose the right moving condi-

tion:

with d the dimensionally reduced eight dimensional dirac operator.

for the gauge functions of the scalars , we choose holomorphicity condition:

dz

dz+ , dz.

(3.2)

(3.3)

note that it follows from the discussions in [15] that there exists no tendimensional

analogue of the tqft of [8][9]. we could therefore have expected, already from the
eight dimensional point of view, that imposing gauge functions for the s would make
it unavoidable to dene the supersymmetrized tqft on a two-dimensional manifold.

in the u (1) case, our set of elds can easily be interpreted (with the scheme indicated

above) as ten-dimensional twisted nsr or heterotic superstring elds, in the same manner

as in [10]. however, the question arises whether this remains true in the non-commuting

case. we have expanded the action dened by the above gauge xings. unfortunately,

examining the bosonic part shows that the commutator terms break the so(10) invariance
down to so(8)  so(2). we havent yet found a possible modication of our gauge
functions that would enable so(10) invariance, but we suspect that there might exist

deep reasons for our diculties besides the mere lack of imagination.

7

4. topological gravity side and anomaly cancellation

in the seek of a covariant description, arises the necessity of having some gauge sym-
metry allowing to eliminate the longitudinal components  and their supersymmetric

partners. in the ordinary superstring, this symmetry is the worldsheet reparametrisation

and local supersymmetry invariance. the unphysical coordinates are canceled by the corre-

sponding (b, c), (, ) ghost systems (more subtle compensations occur for the construction
of the heterotic string). here, we need the symmetry with functional dimension 2(n 2  1)
for it to be capable of eliminating the two longitudinal u (n ) matrices , and its gener-

alization for supersymmetric partners. the natural choice would be some matrix-valued

dieomorphisms, if one can make sense of that.

4.1. need of some extended twodimensional gravity

we can reformulate this from the twisted point of view: our twisted matrix string

theory being topological by construction, has no local anomaly. nor can its coupling to

2dgravity introduce any anomaly: the 2dgravity must also be of a topological type.

the aim then, is to construct a theory which, after untwisting, has the ward identities

of a superconformal theory. we are therefore lead to couple our gauge functions to a

matrix extension of the topological 2dgravity used for u (1) strings, which can hopefully

be untwisted in a way such to compensate for the anomaly induced by untwisting the

topological matrix string side.

notice that the beltrami and wz elds occurring in (2.8) are now to be understood

as background values obtained by gauge-xing the quantum elds of this topological

2dgravity. therefore, having matrix ghosts is in no contradiction with an apparently

simple 2dgravity background: gauge xing is purely local. we have not attempted to

understand the moduli which should be introduced in this theory, and leave unstudied the

global aspects.

4.2. matrix extension and anomaly cancellation

let us now discuss the anomaly question in more details. our model being topological

in nature, it has a vanishing conformal anomaly when all elds have the spins described

above, prior to twist. it is crucial to understand whether it is justied to map our twisted
elds to physical ones, where matrices m have weight zero, fermions have spin 1
2 and so
on. indeed, in the course of doing so, we expect to generate a super-conformal anomaly

8

from the set of u (n ) matter elds.

in the ordinary string case, the anomaly from the

matter sector is compensated by the anomaly from the (b, c) and (, ) systems of the

twisted gravity side. here, the matter anomaly is that of u (n ) matrix elds, and an

extended gravity multiplet is needed to cancel this anomaly.

in the ir limit, the proper (single-valued) matrix string elds, interpreted as those

for long strings, are dened on an n sheeted riemann surface [5][11]. we suggest to
introduce some n  n matrix 2dgravity, with the diagonal (e
z,z)ii of the n  n zweibein
describing gravity on the ith sheet, whereas the o-diagonal (e
z,z)ij would specify how the
ith and jth sheets feel each other. similarly for the associated (b, c) and (, ) matrix

ghosts, corresponding to having the symmetry of n independent reparametrisations for

each sheet. the ordinary string has, as a gauge symmetry, the (super)dieomorphisms

di() times conformal rescalings of the world-sheet metric h. in particular the rst

quantized string amplitude is of the form

1

di()z [dx][dh]

z1 

es(x,h).

in a second-quantized picture we expect amplitudes like:

(z1)n
n ! 

1

di(  . . .  )z [dx1] . . . [dxn ][dh

1] . . . [dh

n ]

epi

s(xi,hi)

the group of dieomorphisms di( . . . ) contains, in addition to the n independent
reparametrisations, the permutations which produce the factor of (n !).

in this picture, one understands the background values of (e)ij, used in the gauge
functions (2.4)(2.7), as a diagonal background with all eigenvalues equal, that is all n

sheets of the multi-folded surface being non-interacting, at sheets. then clearly, when all

matrices commute (matter and gravity elds), one can reasonably expect a cancellation of

the anomaly: it should be proportional to n both in the matter and gravity ghosts sector.
ideally, in this case, we would set the wz type elds l, l to trivial backgrounds. but if
an anomaly was to subsist after untwisting both sectors (matrix matter and gravity), we
would naturally use l, l as wz elds, to compensate for the residual anomaly. we can
make them propagate by adding a sector in the tqft and impose the gauge functions:

(z  z

zz)l = zz
z

(4.1)

such constraints have been used in [16], for the sake of disentangling left-right asymmetric

anomalies. imposing them as the gauge functions of a tqft should produce a twisted

9

super-liouville action for the l, l multiplets that we expect to decouple in the limit of

commuting matrices.

now, the interesting question is whether one can promote the independent sheets

reparametrisations into a unied matrix structure, in a way such to also ensure anomaly

cancellation away from the ir xed point. we propose evidence that these ghost systems
might arise from the wn+1 of w partially twisted gravity.

4.3. wgravity proposal

wnalgebras have sl(n, ir) (or sln(c)) internal symmetry [17][18][19][20]. they can
be ghostied, and produce a 2dgravity structure with a duplication of beltrami dieren-

tials and reparametrisation ghosts. formally, one can consider their topological extensions,

and reach a similar ghost action to that of ordinary topological 2dgravity. by adjusting

the value of n, one could possibly get a contribution to the conformal anomaly opposite to

that of the matrix superstring. for nite n, technical diculties arise from the fact that
wnalgebras are not really lie algebras and need non linear terms to close. however, these
problems disappear for large values of n: w is an algebra, for which one can generalize
quite precisely the notion of beltrami dierentials [21].

consider n copies of the bosonic string actions in light-cone gauge:

nxi=1

zx

i zx

i + hzz

i zx

i zx

i

(4.2)

here we allow for a dierent metric hab
i

for each dierent i, since the virasoro constraints

tzz,i = 0 is to be imposed for each i separately. the way to do so while preserving the
unbroken gauge group sn is to form the wlike currents [6]

wl =

nxi=1

t l

zz,i

where l = 1, . . . , n and gauge the algebra which is generated by them.

this way, we get n ghosts ci of increasing conformal dimension (2i, 0).

in a
supersymmetric context these are accompanied by the bosonic ghosts of dimensions ( 1
2 
2i, 0). their whole contribution to the conformal anomaly grows as n 2 for large n , which
is a good indication since we start with n 2 degrees of freedom in the matter sector.

10

5. further remarks and concluding comments

5.1. six dimensional matrix string theories

we could also wonder about a similar construction with the four dimensional topolog-

ical yangmills theory of [22] as a starting point. its reduction to two dimensions, already

considered in [23], gives a theory that one can interpret as a (non-critical) six dimensional

matrix superstring theory in the light-cone gauge (cf. little string theories [24],[25]). with

the same chain of arguments as above, the tqft dened by supersymmetrization would

give its covariant formulation. all of our formulae are most simply modied to the four

dimensional case: complex indices should now run from 1 to 2 rather than 3, and the

octonionic structure constants should be replaced by those for quaternions.

the interpretation of this 2dtheory goes beyond the level of ordinary superstrings

since usual perturbative arguments obviously indicate that it cannot be anomaly free.

however, this might not be so bad a problem: although the six-dimensional theory is

perturbatively anomalous, it could be given a sense within the non-perturbative version

of string theory, where one can expect an anomaly inow from the bulk, that could take

care of the non-conservation of the brstcurrent.

5.2. matrix theory

as an aside, we would like to stress out that the octonionic or su (4) instanton equa-

tions also dene a twisted version of the matrix theory of [2]. indeed, after dimensional

reduction to zero dimension, one can use the technique of [26] and oxidize to the the-

ories in one, two or higher dimensions (the theories in [27][28] are obtained in this way;

see also [29]). in zero dimensions, the action is a sum of squares of commutators. from

the positivity of the casimirs in the topological gauge functions, this action is minimized

if and only if each one of the commutators vanishes. one then has a matrix theory for

the cartan subalgebra of the group. this theory has been studied in [30][31][32], and the

mass deformation in this case is quite useful in analyzing the witten index [32].

with this twisted picture, the various compactications (reductions) of mtheory on
tori t d would then correspond to lifting-ups (oxidations) of the topological matrix theory
to dual tori t d.

moreover, a new feature arises, special to the one dimensional theories: when using

the octonionic equations to dene some supersymmetric quantum mechanics, one has the

possibility of adding a mass term through

d0i +

1
2

ci
jk[j, k]  i

11

(5.1)

where the seven scalars i=17 are organized in terms of the fundamental of spin(7). this

raises opportunities for supersymmetry breaking.

5.3. conclusion

the covariant formulation of the orbifold theory of dvv, if it can be reached, should

produce a covariant formulation of the second quantized free string theory. once the

worldsheet covariance is achieved, the theory has worldsheet  with arbitrary b0() and
b1(). once the formulation is obtained for the gs = 0 limit it is legitimate to ask for the
extension to non zero gs, i.e. nite gym.

in the seek of a covariant formulation, one could have proceeded along the lines of

dvv and presented a ghost-dressed version of the vertex operators constructed in [5] for

zz2 twists (and higher order twists as well). adding these operators to the action produces
the transitions which change the topology of the worldsheet . however, since arbitrary

(orientable) topology has already been allowed by covariance, one gets essentially the same

theory. one consequence out of this redundancy is the possibility to restrict oneself to genus

zero, as was suggested a long time ago by v. knizhnik in [33]. we have not explored this

issue in this paper.

instead, we have tried to nd the matrix formulation for the covariant theory at

nite gym, and have suggested possible formulations of the matrix string theory. unfor-

tunately, for non vanishing gs, the ones we have worked out so far only make manifest
so(8) so(2) rather than the tendimensional poincare symmetry. still, we believe that
this approach is worth further study and could provide hints to the search of the covariant

formulation of mtheory itself.
