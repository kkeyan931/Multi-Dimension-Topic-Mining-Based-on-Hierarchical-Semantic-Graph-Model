abstract

a new version of holographic principle for (spherically symmetric) cosmology is proposed,
which dictates that particle entropy within cosmological apparent horizon should not exceed
gravitational entropy associated with the horizon.
it is shown that, in standard big-bang
cosmology, universes of all spatial curvature are consistent with the new holography. it is also
shown that string inationary cosmology is also compatible with the new holography, provided
smooth graceful exit mechanism is dynamically built in.

holographic principle rst put forward by t hooft [1] and, later, extended to string theory
by susskind [2] and thorn [3] has emerged as a new paradigm for understanding semi-classical

gravity. the most radical aspect of the principle is that microscopic degrees of freedom that
build up the gravitational dynamics do reside not in bulk spacetime but in its boundary. more-
over, the number of boundary degrees of freedom per planck area is bounded and constrained

not to exceed unity.

recently, initiated by fischler and susskind [4] 2, the holographic principle has been studied
extensively in the cosmological context [6, 7, 8, 9]. the cosmological holographic principle due to
fischler-susskind demands that matter entropy enclosed inside a spatial volume of cosmological

particle horizon should not exceed area of the horizon (measured in planck unit). they have
shown that a restricted class of at or open universes are consistent with the requirement, while
closed universe is not. applied to the string inationary cosmology [10], it is also found [6] that

the fischler-susskind holographic principle is satised, in pre-big-bang branch, for cold and at
or open universe only (provided the universe makes a smooth graceful exit to post-big-bang
branch) but not for closed universe 3.

one outstanding issue posed by the fischler-susskind holography has been the following

question: on what grounds is the choice of particle horizon unique or justied for application of
the holography principle? to appreciate the question better, one will only need to recall that, in

cosmology, particle or event horizon refers to the entire past or future light-cones and hence to
initial or nal moments of the universe, about which (semi-)classical description breaks down
completely. as such, it would be highly desirable to reformulate the cosmological holography

in terms of local geometric data only.

in this paper, motivated by the question addressed above, we propose a new cosmological

holographic principle based on the concept of apparent horizon, a boundary hypersurface of
an anti-trapped region 4. as will be discussed below, it turns out that there exists a natural
gravitational entropy dened in terms of the apparent horizon and laws of cosmological ther-
modynamics thereof. the new holographic principle we propose in this paper then demands
that matter entropy inside the apparent horizon should not exceed gravitational entropy as-

sociated with the apparent-horizon. we shall be applying the new holographic principle to
the friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) cosmology and show that, in both the standard and

the string inationary cosmologies, universes with at, open, or closed spatial sections are all
consistent with the new holographic principle. this conclusion is in sharp contrast to that

of fischler-susskind holographic principle, and again highlights sensitive dependence of the

2bekenstein has put forward exactly the same constraint [5] much earlier, and have used it to argue against

an existence of cosmological singularity.

3related aspects of string cosmology have been studied in [11, 12, 13].
4for this reason, the apparent horizon is sometimes referred as trapping horizon.

cosmological apparent horizon and gravitational entropy: we shall be considering spa-

tially homogeneous and isotropic universe described by the frw metric,

ds2 = dt2 + a2(t)

dr2

1  kr2 + a2(t)r2d2

d1 ,

(1)

where k = 0,1, +1 correspond to a at, open or closed universe respectively. the metric may
be recasted into a spherically symmetric (but otherwise general) form:

ds2 = habdxadxb + r2(x)d2

d1 ,

(2)

where x0 = t, x1 = r and the two metric hab = diagh1,
1kr2i is introduced. for spherically
symmetric spacetime, eq.(2), one can show that the aerial radius r is a dynamical invariant.
one can then dene a dynamical apparent horizon in terms of a condition ||r||2  habarbr =
0 to the aerial radius. it implies that the two-dimensional one-form r is null (or degenerate)
on the surface of the apparent horizon 5. evaluating it explicitly, one nds

a2

rah =

qh 2 + k

(3)

where h = a/a is the hubble parameter. one also nds that the expansion in (out) of the
ingoing (outgoing) null geodesic congruence [14] is given by

the region of spherically symmetric spacetime is referred as trapped (anti-trapped) if the
expansions of both in- and out-going null geodesics, normal to the spatial (d  1)-dimensional
sphere of a radius r centered at the origin, are negative (positive). the region will be called

normal if ingoing rays have negative expansion but the outgoing rays have positive expansion.
2 is anti-trapped (trapped) for h > 0 (h < 0) whereas the region

2 is normal. the boundary hypersurface of the antitrapped spacetime region
is nothing but the apparent horizon surface. the ingoing rays outside the horizon actually

propagate in the direction of the growing r, whereas the ingoing rays inside the horizon are
moving toward the origin.

5 the one-form dr is a dynamical analog of stationary killing vector.

in the einstein-de sitter-like universe relevant for inationary cosmology, where a(t) =
a0eht, h = constant and k = 0, the apparent horizon, rah = 1/h, is constant in time and
coincides with the familiar event horizon of the de sitter space. the anti-trapped region outside
the apparent horizon in the de sitter space can never be seen to the comoving observer located
at the origin. in generic cosmological situations, however, the apparent horizon evolves in time,
rah = rah(t) and visibility of the anti-trapped, outer region ought to depend on the time
in case the rah(t) shrinks with forward time evolution,
evolution of the apparent horizon.
the spatial region outside the horizon would never be seen. on the other hand, if it grows,
the spatial region outside of the horizon at a given instance may become observable at later

time. the situation is rather reminiscent of that with the apparent horizon of a black hole.
namely, the trapped region can never be seen by an asymptotic outside observer if the horizon
of the black grows by an infalling matter, while once-trapped region may become visible if the

apparent horizon shrinks by an evaporation of the black hole via hawking radiation.

another dynamical invariant of the spherically symmetric spacetime eq.(2) is a local energy

inside a sphere of radius r dened by

e(r) 

d(d  1)
16gn bd rd2(cid:16)1  ||r||2(cid:17) ,

(5)

where gn is the d-dimensional newtons constant, and bd = 
of a d-dimensional unit ball. physically, this energy represents local, active gravitational energy
and turns out to be a (d+1)-dimensional generalization of the (3+1) dimensional energy dened

2 + 1(cid:17) denotes the volume

d

2 /(cid:16) d

originally by misner and sharp [15].

an interesting aspect of the invariant energy is that energy surrounded by the apparent
horizon rah is given by eah = d(d1)
ah , and agrees with the gravitational mass of (d + 1)-
dimensional schwarzschield black hole, once the cosmological apparent horizon is replaced by
the event horizon of the black hole. another interesting aspect of the invariant energy is

16gn bd rd2

that, utilizing the einsteins equation, one can derive a dynamical version of the rst-law of
gravitational thermodynamics. let us dene t ab
matter as projection of the (d + 1)-dimensional
matter energy-momentum tensor t 
matter to the direction normal to the (d  1)-sphere, d1.
one may then dene work density by

physically, the work density at the apparent horizon represents work done by a change of
the apparent horizon, while the energy-supply vector at the apparent horizon represents total

energy ow through the apparent horizon, facts already noted in ref.
black holes.

[16] in the context of

using the einsteins equations, one can relate the variation of the invariant energy eq.(5)

to the above matter quantities by

e = a + w v ,

(8)

where a  d bdrd1 and v = bdrd. the eq.(8) is interpreted naturally as unied rst law of
cosmological thermodynamics. the entropy is associated with the energy-supply term, which

in fact can be rewritten, with help of the einstein equations again, as

a =

s

8a + rd2(cid:16) e

rd2(cid:17) .

here, s represents the surface gravity and is dened by

s

2 2

hr .

(9)

(10)

at the apparent horizon, the last term in eq.(9) vanishes and the dynamic gravitational entropy
is then identied with s = a
4 , viz. a quarter of the area of the apparent horizon measured in
the planck unit. this is a direct (d + 1)-dimensional generalization of the denition of dynamic

entropy introduced earlier in the context of (3+1)-dimensional black holes [16]. more precisely,
the dynamic entropy associated with the cosmological apparent horizon is

sah(t) =

one should note that, in the case of open or closed universes, the at-volume is dierent from

the physical volume, vph(r) = dbdadr r

inside a spatial ball of radius r. the
dierence stems from the fact that the invariant energy contains not only matter contribution
but also gravity contribution.

having examined the issue of the cosmological entropy and identifying the entropy eq.(11)
as the one satisfying the dynamical version of the rst-law of cosmological thermodynamics, we

now state our proposal of a cosmological holographic principle: the particle entropy inside the
apparent horizon can never exceed the apparent-horizon gravitational entropy

smatter(t) = svolah(t)  sgravity(t) =

aah(t)
4gn

,

(16)

where s denotes the matter entropy density measured in comoving space, which is constant in
time, and volah(t) = vph(rah(t))

denotes the comoving volume inside the apparent horizon.

ad(t)

the main dierence of our proposal from the one of fischler-susskind lies in dierent choice
of the ducial horizon. fischler and susskind have used the gravitational entropy associated

with the particle horizon as the maximal bound for matter entropy. in the cosmological context,
there are two dierent kind of horizons based on the light-ray paths[17]. the cosmological

particle horizon specifying visible region for a comoving observer at time t, is expressed as

rph = a(t)g1 z t

ti

dt

a(t)! ,

(17)

0 dy/1  ky2 and ti represents the initial moment of the universe. (in case
where g(x)  r x
the universe has no beginning, ti = .) on the other hand, the cosmological event horizon
specifying the boundary of the spatial region to be seen in the future by the comoving observer
is given by

reh = a(t)g1 z tf

t

dt

a(t)! ,

(18)

where tf is the nal moment of the universe. clearly, both horizons are intimately attached
with the initial or the nal moment of the universe, where our physical description in terms of
semi-classical gravity often breaks down, and there is no clear physical reason why one should

adopt one or the other (or both) in formulating cosmological holographic principle.

unlike particle or event horizons, the cosmological apparent horizon in eq.(3) does not refer

at all to either initial or nal moment of the universe. as such, the new holographic principle
based on the cosmological apparent horizon is free from strong quantum gravity regime and
in fact is dened solely based on local geometric invariants (at least for spherically symmetric,

but not necessarily homogeneous universe).

cosmic holography constraints of the frw universe: generally, the holographic principle
may restrict matter content of our universe as it involves the particle entropy of universe. as

the matter content aects both geometry and evolution of the universe, the universe itself
conformed with the holography principle may well belong to a restricted class.

in testing the holography condition, eq.(16), against the frw cosmology, we will be re-

stricting our discussion to the cases in which matter content obeys a simple equation of state,
p = . the sound speed in the matter medium is then given by vs = .

for at universe (k = 0), the holography condition eq.(16) reads

d

(19)

d(1+) for  6= 1 and a(t) = a0eh0t for  = 1, one concludes that, for ||  1,
as a(t) = a0t
the holography condition is satised for all subsequent evolution once it was at the planck
epoch. for || > 1, which is inconsistent with special relativity, the holography condition is
not satised at all epoch either.

for open universe (k = 1), it is convenient to introduce the conformal time ,

and rewrite the metric eq.(1) as

ds2 = a2()hd2 + (d2 + sinh2  d2

the holography condition, eq.(16), now reads

where  = d(1+)2
,   (0, ) for  > 0 and   (, 0) for  < 0 6. from the denition
of the cosmological apparent horizon in (3), one nds ah = ||. using the explicit solution,
eq.(23), one can easily show that, for   1, the holography condition is satised provided it
was satised at the initial moment near the planck epoch. for  > 1, the maximum of the
left-hand-side of eq.(22) occurs at later time since the initial epoch and hence the holography

condition requires that the bound is satised at the the maximum epoch. of course, if the
holography bound is saturated at the planck epoch, then the case of  > 1 is rejected by the

6the initial moment corresponds to  = 0 for  > 0 and  for  < 0.

holography condition (in addition to special relativity). so far restriction of the holography
condition to the matter content has not been dierent much from that of fischler-susskind

holography. we will now see that some dierences arise in the case of the closed universe.

where   (cid:16)0, 1
d  1) is peculiar in that it begins with
an innite scale factor a() and hence shall not be discussed further. noting that rah() =
sin(||), one obtains that ah = ||, or   ||. examining signs of the expansions, eq.(4),
one nds the region ||      || with 0  || < 
2 is anti-trapped, while the region
  ||    || with 
2  || <  is trapped. consequently, there are in general two
distinct apparent horizons in the closed universe; one closer to the origin ( = 0) and the other
nearer to the antipodal point ( = ). from the viewpoint of the comoving observer sitting at

the origin, the closer apparent horizon

ah = ( || ,

for 0  || <

(26)

should be the relevant apparent horizon in evaluating the particle entropy enclosed by the appar-
ent horizon, to which the comoving observer belongs. as the ratio 4svolah/aah is symmetric
about || = /2, it suces to test the holography condition only for 0  || < 
2 .

using the solution eq.(25), one can evaluate the ratio and nd an epoch at which the ratio
reaches maximum. one then nds that the universe with  > 2
d  1 are consistent with the
cosmic holography condition. namely, for 1   > 2
d  1, the holography condition is satised
once it was at the initial planck epoch. for  > 1, there occurs a nite maximum of the ratio
at a nite , and the holography condition can be satised if it was at the maximum point.

in the fischler-susskind case, it turns out that the holography condition excluded the closed
universe only for 2
3. on the
contrary, in the newly proposed holographic principle, the closed universe with any value of 

d  1, which in d = 3 includes matter with ||  1

turns out completely consistent.

string cosmology and cosmic holography: we will be also applying the newly proposed

holographic principle to string inationary cosmology [10]. the (d + 1)-dimensional low-energy
eective action of string theory is given by

(27)

where v9d, ls, ,lm denote the volume of the (9d)-dimensional compactied space, the string
length scale, the dilaton eld and ns-ns matter lagrangian, respectively. we assume that the

pre-big-bang branch is described by spatially homogeneous and isotropic and hence is described
by the frw metric in string frame:

ds2

string = dt2 + a2(t)h dr2

1  kr2 + r2d2

d1i .

the einstein frame metric diers from the string-frame one by a conformal factor:

e = e 4

d1i .

(28)

(29)

in what follows, we will denote the einstein-frame factor by ae(t) = a(t)e 2
choices of the metric, it is necessary to clarify a few points. the apparent horizon should be
dened in terms of the einstein frame metric, as the second law of the cosmological thermody-

d1 . as for dierent

namics discussed earlier holds not in the string frame but in the einstein frame. thus, area of
the apparent horizon representing the gravitational entropy ought to be evaluated again in the

einstein-frame metric. on the other hand, the coordinate entropy density of particles does not
involve the scale factor, and hence it is frame-independent. using the einstein-frame metric,

the coordinate apparent horizon is found to be

here, h = a/a is the hubble parameter in string frame, and  and p are the eective matter

matter are related by

(33)

in the pre-big-bang phase, the string equations of motion, eq.(31) in d-spatial dimensions

1 + d2 ln(t)

(34)

over the range  < t < 0. here, a0, 0 are overall constant factors and the coordinate time t
is measured in string unit. the entropy ratio denoted as r in eq.(33) is then found explicitly

as

r = const.(t)

d2
d2+1 .

(35)

from the requirement that the holography bound is to be satised at t  , the ns-ns
matter should be constrained by ||  1/d. likewise, in order not to violate the holography
condition as t  0, the pre-big bang phase ought to make a graceful exit to the post-big
bang phase (for ||  1/d).

for open string universe (k = 1), one nds it convenient to introduce ah() by

sinh ah() = rah() =

(37)

as shown in ref. [6], for   1, ae is a monotonically decreasing function in   (, 0) . i both
ae and ah become large as  goes to , and hence the holography condition is satised
trivially in this early epoch. the entropy ratio then grows as  grows and a graceful exit

ought to occur before the inequality becomes saturated. thus, with an appropriate graceful
exit mechanism, the open string universe is again consistent with the holography.

turning nally to closed string universe (k = +1), let us again introduce ah by

sin ah() = rah() =

note that ah = /2 at the turning point a
e = 0. as in the standard big-bang cosmology,
one ought to choose ah  /2 out of the two solutions obeying eq.(38) as the relevant
apparent horizon. the einstein scale factor ae takes a zero value initially, then grows and
reach its maximum at the turning point, and subsequently decreases until it returns to the zero
value. thus, epochs of potential violation the holography condition, are the initial and the

nal moments. one thus nds that, by supplementing these two moments with appropriate
initial or nal (which amounts to the graceful exit mechanism) conditions compatible with

the holography condition, the closed string universe can be consistent with the newly proposed
holographic principle.

two comments are in order. first, comparing the above results on string inationary cos-
mology with those based on fischler-susskind criterion. using their criterion, in our earlier
analysis [6], we have found that at string universe with matter is ruled out by the holography

condition. in the newly proposed holographic principle, at string universe is perfectly con-
sistent so long as an appropriate graceful exit mechanism is provided. the dierence stems

from the fact that, in the pre-big bang phase, the particle horizon is innite whereas the appar-
ent horizon remains nite at all epoch. second, the newly proposed cosmological holographic

principle is based on dynamical apparent horizon as a unique local geometric invariant of
the cosmological background. in fact, in eq.(2), one only assumes isotropy (spherical symme-

try) of the background, but neither homogeneity nor (non)existence of specic cosmological
singularities resulting in thereof.
