abstract

the problem of gauge independent denition of eective gravitational eld
is considered from the point of view of the process of measurement. under as-
sumption that dynamics of the measuring apparatus can be described by the
ordinary classical action, eective slavnov identities for the generating function-
als of green functions corresponding to a system of arbitrary gravitational eld
measured by means of scalar particles are obtained. with the help of these iden-
tities, the total gauge dependence of the non-local part of the one-loop eective
apparatus action, describing the long-range quantum corrections, is calculated.
the value of eective gravitational eld inferred from the eective apparatus
action is found to be gauge-dependent. a probable explanation of this result,
referring to a peculiarity of the gravitational interaction, is given.

1 introduction

quantization of elds, like any other quantization procedure, contains as one of its
inalienable traits an ambiguity in the choice of a set of fundamental variables in terms
of which transition from deterministic classical theory to statistical quantum theory is
performed. in quantum mechanics this constitutes most of what is called the operator-
ordering problem.
in the quantum theory of elds this appears as the problem of
dependence of observables on the choice of eld parametrization or, in gauge theo-
ries, on the choice of gauge-xing conditions. nowhere it is better illustrated than in
calculation of the eective elds, i.e. elds incorporating vacuum polarization eects
induced by a given classical solutions. due to special structure of lagrangians of quan-
tum electrodynamics and yang-mills theories, gauge dependence of the corresponding
eective elds occurs only beginning with the two-loop approximation of the perturba-
tion theory. instead, in quantum gravity, dependence of the eective gravitational eld
on the gauge (and parametrization) is fully displayed already at the one-loop level1.

most generally, the problem under consideration can be stated as the problem of
gauge and parametrization dependence of the eective action. the latter can be dened
either as the sum over all one-particle-irreducible diagrams [1], or as the legendre
transform of the logarithm of the generating functional of green functions with respect
to the sources [2]. the latter denition brings to light the remarkable analogy between
classical equations of motion and the quantum equations describing dynamics of the
mean elds. it suggests natural interpretation of the eective action as the quantum
substitute for its classical counterpart. however, the above-mentioned problem lacks
direct physical application of this analogy.

on the other hand, as we pointed out at the beginning, this drawback is an oblig-
atory consequence of the change in the interpretative framework  non-invariance with
respect to transitions between dierent sets of fundamental variables, with the help of
which averaging procedures are established, is in the very statistical nature of quantum
theory. it disappears only in the classical limit. although this fact is quite obvious,
it should be emphasized that one does not even have to try to prove it, since it is a
direct consequence of bohrs correspondence principle which underlies quantum theory
itself. at this point, we would like to recall that classical conceptions play crucial role
in another important notion of quantum theory  the process of measurement. as
emphasized in [4], the very idea of acquisition of some denite reading by a measuring
device is essentially classical.
in the light of the gauge dependence problem even-
tual classical nature of any process of measurement becomes particularly important.
namely, it raises the question of whether this problem is just a matter of the formal-
ism of eective action itself, or indicates the necessity to include measuring apparatus
into the mathematical description of quantum phenomena explicitly, so as to make it
possible to reformulate the theory of eective quantities in terms characterizing motion
of the apparatus. if the former is true, then we are left with the s-matrix approach
as the only reliable, though very restrictive, means of deriving physical predictions,
while the opposite would mean that we get the most general quantum description at
our disposal2.

the crucial role of the process of measurement in approaching to the problem of
gauge dependence of the eective elds was rst put forward by dalvit and mazz-
itelli [5], who showed, in the case of quantum gravity, that the equations of motion
(geodesic equation) of a test particle in the weak static eective gravitational eld of
a point mass, calculated in the one-loop approximation up to leading logarithms, are
independent of the choice of linear gauge xing the general coordinate invariance. the
essential thing here is that while the quantum interaction of the test particle with the
gravitational eld is negligible in evaluation of the total eective eld, it is not when
the equations of the test particle motion are being determined. it turns out that in the
latter case the gauge-dependent contribution originating from the graviton-test particle
interaction just cancels that corresponding to the ordinary gauge dependence of the
mean gravitational eld. gauge independence of the equations of motion of the clas-
sical apparatus allows one to dene the gauge independent eective gauge eld as the
eld that enters these equations and couples to the measuring device in the classical
fashion.

this important result raises naturally the following questions: rst of all, is the

2this alternative, of course, is exhaustive only as far as the problem of gauge dependence is
concerned. an eventual solution to this problem may well turn out to be unsatisfactory from other
points of view.

2

aforesaid cancellation just a lucky accident conditioned by the model chosen and the
approximations made in [5], or represents a general property of gauge interactions?
second, if the latter is true, what is the formal mathematical reason underlying the
above-mentioned gauge dependence cancellation? that this cancellation is not a mere
chance in power-counting-renormalizable theories at least in the low-energy limit is
shown quite generally in [6]. there, the use has been made of the ordinary becchi-
rouet-stora-tyutin (brst) symmetry [7] of the faddeev-popov action [8], which is
not, however, a quantum symmetry in the present case, since it includes transformations
of the classical matter describing the measuring device. this symmetry is expressed by
slavnov-type identities for green functions, obtained in [6] and called there eective
slavnov identities. with the help of the renormalization equation following from these
identities, gauge independence of the eective equations of device motion is proved in
the low-energy limit up to leading logarithms.

the purpose of the present paper is to continue investigation of these matters in
the case of quantum gravity. first of all, it is important to consider the role of the
measuring apparatus from the eld-theoretical point of view, i.e., when the apparatus
is described by some classical elds dynamics of which can be determined by the lim-
iting procedure of transition from the quantum to the classical eld theory. second, it
is desirable to extend the whole analysis to arbitrary space-time congurations. sig-
nicance of the eective slavnov identities is that they allow one to put the problem
of gauge dependence, understood in the sense outlined above, in the most adequate
and technically convenient way. namely, they permit to escape the necessity of explicit
evaluation of the mean elds, which requires solving the corresponding wave equations
and subsequent substitution of the results into the eective equations of the apparatus
motion, in order to verify the gauge dependence cancellation,  the way followed in [5].
indeed, as shown in [6], the problem of calculation of the total gauge dependence of
the eective device action reduces to evaluation of the gauge dependence of connected
green functions containing vertices of the gauge eld-device interaction. it is this sim-
plication that allows us to investigate the problem under consideration in arbitrary
gravitational elds. this is the subject of the present article. we take as an example
the quantized gravitational eld measured by a classical scalar eld. as in [5], the
measuring apparatus is considered as testing (i.e. neglecting its contribution to the
total eective gravitational eld), so the results are trivially extended to the case when
the apparatus is described by an arbitrary number of scalar particles possessing, in
particular, internal symmetries (e.g., the pions), the only condition being one and the
same structure of interaction with the gravitational eld for all particles.

a very important peculiarity of the gravitational interaction must be mentioned
here. as was noted in [9], the notion of classical matter looses its usual meaning
in the case of gravity, simply because the strength of the gravitational interaction is
proportional to the particle mass. as a result, the relative quantum corrections to
the equations of motion of the particle do not disappear in the limit m  . in
particular, the whole calculation of the gauge dependence of the eective apparatus
action is divided into two large parts: evaluation of the total (in the sense of [5]) gauge
dependence of the scalar eld eective action when the quantum propagation of the
scalar eld is neglected (i.e., when its initial action is taken in the usual classical form),
and calculation of the gauge dependence of the o-mass-shell scalar eld form factors
in the limit m  .

the rst part of this program is carried out in this paper.

3

our paper is organized as follows. we begin in sec. 2 with a more detailed for-
mulation of the gauge dependence problem as well as of the approach to it, adopted
in this paper. the eective slavnov identities for the generating functionals of green
functions, introduced in sec. 3, are derived in sec. 4. in essential, this derivation re-
produces that given in [6].
in sec. 5, these identities are used in evaluation of the
logarithmic contribution to the -dependent part of the generating functional of con-
nected green functions,  being the gauge parameter weighting lorentz-type gauge
condition ah + bh = 0. we nd that, unlike the case of the point-like mea-
suring apparatus considered in [5], this contribution is not zero. the results obtained
are discussed in sec. 6.

we use the highly condensed notations of dewitt [10] throughout this paper. also
left derivatives with respect to anticommuting variables are used. the dimensional
regularization of all divergent quantities is supposed.

2 preliminaries

before we proceed to calculations, we would like to give a somewhat more detailed
account of the main aspects of the gauge dependence problem, briey mentioned in
the introduction.

2.1 the origin of the problem

first of all, we would like to point out the close connection of the gauge dependence
problem with the analogous problem of dependence of the eective action on the choice
of eld parametrization. roughly speaking, imposition of the gauge conditions in a
gauge theory, being equivalent to picking a subset out of the total set of variables de-
scribing the theory, includes, in particular, freedom to perform arbitrary substitutions
among the variables of the subset. the parametrization dependence problem is just
the reection of this freedom possessed by any gauge as well as non-gauge eld theory.
as a matter of fact, any like the above reasoning has restricted validity in eld theory
because of the fundamental locality requirements. nevertheless, it is a general result
of the batalin-vilkovisky method [12] that the behavior of the eective action under
variations of the gauge conditions is essentially the same as under arbitrary changes of
parametrization  both are represented by anticanonical transformations (in the sense
of the batalin-vilkovisky antibracket). this result is established in full generality in
[13] and, furthermore, is valid in renormalized as well as unrenormalized theory. in
view of this fact, one can speak about either gauge or parametrization dependence of
the eective action.

let us now turn to the problem itself. as we have already mentioned above, its
origin is in the inevitable ambiguity in the choice of a set of fundamental variables in
terms of which the quantization procedure is carried out. consider a simple example.
let the system be described by an action s() which is a function of a single scalar
eld (x) and suppose that the functional integral measure can be chosen simply as
the product of d(x). then the mean eld (y) is

h(y)i = z yx

d(x)(y) exp{is()},

(1)

4

the subscript  indicates that the role of fundamental dynamical variable is played
here by the eld  itself. nothing prevents us, however, from taking as fundamental
any other eld  = f [], f [] being an arbitrary (local) non-degenerate function, in
which case eq. (1) is replaced by

h(y)i = z yx
s()  s(f 1[]).

d(x)(y) exp{is()},

(2)

employing dimensional regularization, so that (0)-type expressions are set equal to
zero, we rewrite eq. (2) as

h(y)i = z yx

d(x)f [(y)] exp{is()} = hf [(y)]i.

(3)

since there is no reason to prefer one way of quantization to the other, in particular,
one denition of the mean eld to the other, one can try at least to compare the two.
obviously, the only way to do this is to use the relation  = f []. consider, e.g., the 
picture. on the one hand, as it follows from eq. (1), the mean eld is equal to h(y)i.
on the other hand, one is equally right to take for it the value f 1[h(y)i]. thus,
taking into account eq. (3), we conclude that the change  = f [] of fundamental
variables leads to the following change in the value of the mean eld

h(y)i  f 1[hf [(y)]i].
conversely, in the  picture, one arrives at the rule

h(y)i  f [hf 1[(y)]i].

(4)

(5)

assumptions concerning the regularization scheme and the function f [], made
above, play no role: the same transformation rule (4) applies in the general case, as
it follows from the results of [14]. obviously, ambiguity expressed by this rule is an
indispensable consequence of statistical nature of quantum eld theory together with
complete equivalence of various pictures (i.e., formulations in various sets of variables)
at the classical level. we would like to emphasize in this connection that the very use
of the relation  = f [] in comparison of the two quantum pictures above is by itself
essentially classical. yet this deprives the transformations (4) of any signicance in
the quantum domain, whereas at the classical level these turn, of course, into a trivial
identity. nevertheless, requirement of invariance with respect to the transformations
(4) is taken in [15] as the starting point in construction of a modication of the ordinary
eective action, aimed at derivation of physically sensible predictions. as it follows from
what we just said, apart from the question of whether the action proposed in [15] is
actually gauge-independent, such an object would have nothing to do with the genuine
problem of gauge dependence. instead, one is prompted by the above discussion to seek
the way out of this diculty in reformulation of the theory in classical terms. this
is exactly what is done in [5]. eective gravitational eld is dened there through the
eective equations of motion of a classical test particle, namely, as the eld that takes
place of the classical gravitational eld in the ordinary geodesic equation. obviously,
this is the only denition relevant to the state of aairs in the light of the process of
measurement. indeed, in any case it is motion of specic classical apparatus measuring

5

the eld at any given space-time interval that is only observed. thus, it is value of the
eld entering classical equations of motion of the apparatus that is only important.

following [5], we consider the apparatus as testing, i.e., as an innitely small dis-
turbance of the gravitational eld it measures. let us now show how this technical
assumption allows one to simplify the calculations to be performed below.

2.2 the role of simple connectedness

since we are interested mainly in answering the question of whether the eective eld,
dened in the sense of dalvit and mazzitelli, is actually gauge independent, rather
than in its specic value, especially in the case of quantum gravity, we can simplify
evaluation of the total gauge-dependent part of the eective device action as follows. as
is explained in the introduction, this part is the sum of two dierent contributions. the
rst is the ordinary explicit gauge dependence of the eective device action. the second
stems from its implicit gauge dependence through the mean gauge eld. it is exactly
this dependence of the mean gravitational eld that lacks its physical interpretation.
let the measuring apparatus be described by a set of classical elds, denoted as .
then, if  stands for the -dependent part of the generating functional of one-particle-
irreducible green functions, , we have for the full variation of the eective device
action under a small change  of a gauge parameter :

(h, , ) =

 +


h

d

(6)

(7)

(8)

where t  {t } is the source for the gravitational eld, and h  {h} is the mean
deviation of the metric from minkowskian.
now note, that if the quantity w is dened by analogy with , i.e., as the -

dependent part of the generating functional of connected green functions, w , then

(h, , ) = w(t, , )|t t (h,) ,

since the device contribution is innitesimal.

comparing eqs. (6) and (7), we arrive at the following important relation

d(h, , )

d

=

w(t, , )



.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)hh(t,)

due to this result, transition to the strongly connected diagrams in the eective

slavnov identities derived below becomes unnecessary.

3 the quantum action and the generating function-

als

the method we approach the gauge dependence problem allows consideration of arbi-
trary space-time congurations. the simplest way to set up any desired is to choose
properly the standard source term normally introduced into the generating functional
of green functions. thus, the role of the eld t  introduced already in eqs. (68) will
be not only to serve as the variable of the legendre transformation, but also to provide

6

a convenient substitute for realistic matter sources. the only trace of the latter is the
conservation law

where the covariant derivatives are dened with respect to the metric h0 satisfying

f is the most general covariant gauge condition linear in h. finally, we assume that
the measuring device can be described by a single scalar eld , its action being

(13)

the action s+s is invariant under the following (innitesimal) gauge transformations5

brst transformation rule for the -eld is here separated from the rest to em-
phasize the special role played by the measuring device in the present formalism. on
the one hand, eqs. (18), (19) span the usual brst transformation of the quantum
action (17). on the other hand, in derivation of the eective slavnov identities below,
the -eld being classical does not take a part in the quantum brst transformation,
i.e., transformation of the path integral measure in the generating functional of green
functions6

z[t, , , k, k, l] = z dhdcd c exp{i( + c + c  + t h)},

before we continue, we would like to make some notes on the form of the generating
functional (20). it is because of its classical nature the eld  is absent in the func-
tional integral measure in eq. (20). the quantum propagation of this eld is thereby
neglected. furthermore, the same classical nature allows -eld to be considered as a
c-function. in terms of the creation a and annihilation a operators this is expressed
as the approximate commutativity

justied if the occupation numbers of the quantum states involved are large compared
with the unity. it is worth to recall in this connection that in quantum eld theory the
classical requirements can be applied only to a nite, although otherwise arbitrary, re-
gion of eld spectrum. in particular, the above condition on the value of the occupation
numbers inevitably becomes meaningless when applied to all energies.

we see, therefore, that the above form of the generating functional is an immediate
consequence of bohrs correspondence principle underlying the whole quantum theory.
it is to be mentioned, however, that it is in the case of the gravitational interaction
where the usual procedure of transition to the classical limit does not work. namely,
as we mentioned in the introduction, it is senseless to increase the apparatus mass in
6for brevity, the product symbol, as well as tensor indices of the elds h, c, c , is omitted in

the path integral measure.

8

order to suppress its quantum contribution, since the same mass multiplies vertices
of the graviton-apparatus interaction. in short, there is no such thing as the classical
source for gravity [9]. in this paper, we follow [5], and put the device action into the
classical form (13) by hands.

as we mentioned in sec. 2.1, the parametrization dependence problem is in fact a
part of the more general problem of gauge dependence. below we consider the latter
case as the more familiar. to illustrate the essence of our approach as well as of the
main result it is sucient to consider the most important kind of the gauge dependence,
namely, dependence on the weighting parameter . to accomplish this, we modify the
quantum action adding the term

y f c ,

y being a constant anticommuting parameter [17]. thus we write the generating
functional of green functions as

z[t, , , k, k, l, y ] = z dhdcd c exp{i(
+y f c  + c + c  + t h)}.

(21)

to complete our denitions, we introduce the generating functional of connected

green functions

w [t, , , k, k, l, y ] = i ln z[t, , , k, k, l, y ],

(22)

and then dene the eective action  in the usual way as the legendre transform of
w with respect to the mean elds

h =

c =

c  =

(denoted by the same symbols as the corresponding eld operators):

are the eective equations of motion for the full quantum corrected eld h.

4 the eective slavnov identities

in terms of green functions, the symmetry with respect to the transformations (14)
is expressed by slavnov-type identities, to derive which we perform a brst shift (18)
of integration variables in the path integral (21). unlike the usual case, however, the
modied quantum action  is not invariant under this operation, since, as we have
mentioned above, the classical eld  does not take a part in it. therefore, we obtain
the following identity

since s is itself invariant under brst-transformations (18), (19),

s

c =

(28)

using this identity, we rewrite the rst term in the square brackets on the left of
eq. (27) as follows

(29)

where the second of eqs. (15), and the locality of generator d() together with the
property (0) = 0 were taken into account.

next, the second term in the square brackets in eq. (27) can be transformed with
the help of the quantum ghost equation of motion, obtained by performing a shift
c  c +  c of integration variables in the functional integral (20):

 d

z dhdcd chf ,

from which it follows that

where the use of the property y 2 = 0 has been made, and the expression /  (0)

we are looking for. in the case l =  =  = 0 it was obtained in [6]. in terms of the
generating functional of connected green functions, it looks like

appearance of the second derivatives in eqs. (30), (31) is to be emphasized. re-
call that it is presence of higher derivatives (with respect to the sources or mean
elds) that makes application of the original formulation of slavnov identities much
less straightforward than of their later reformulation in terms of the sources of brst
transformations, given by zinn-justin [16] and used in our derivation above. however,
even the latter approach does not prevent appearance of the second derivatives in the
eective slavnov identities. although the relation (8) makes this fact unimportant for
our consideration, an alternative choice of the quantum action in the generating func-
tional (21) exists which allows one to overcome it, and to obtain the eective slavnov
identities for proper vertices in the general case of nite contribution of the measuring
device to the eective gravitational eld. this is done in the appendix.

5 gauge dependence of leading low-energy quan-

tum corrections

in this section, we present detailed evaluation of the total -dependence of the logarith-
mic contribution to the eective device action in arbitrary gravitational eld. as we
have seen, this dependence is given by the functional w/, which is conveniently
calculated with the help of the eective slavnov identity (31).

setting l =  =  = 0 in eq. (31) and extracting its y -dependent part, we have

2

w


= t  w

k  +

w


w
 k  i

,

where w, w are dened by

w = w + y w ,

and the sources k , k are also set zero after dierentiation.

finally, extraction of the -dependent part of eq. (32) gives

2

w


= t  w 

k  +

w


w 
 k  i

2w 
 k

,

(32)

(33)

where w  denotes the -independent part of the functional w . since the source k
is set here equal to zero after dierentiation, the notion of -dependence retains its
meaning given in sec. 2.2.

thus, to determine the total -dependence of the eective apparatus action one has
to evaluate the right hand side of eq. (33). however, because of zero dimensionality
of the gravitational eld calculation of innity of diagrams with arbitrary number
of external graviton lines is required. the standard way round this diculty is the
use of the background eld method together with an appropriate choice of the gauge

11

conditions [10]. this leads to the explicitly gauge invariant eective action [11], which
allows one to conne the calculation by the lowest order of the weak eld approximation,
and then restore the whole gauge invariant contribution on dimensional grounds. it
should be emphasized, however, that in our case the very use of this method is under
question. indeed, functional dependence of the gauge conditions on the background
eld is to be considered here on equal footing with the dependence on the gauge
parameters , . therefore, the background eld method itself can be used only after
the eective apparatus action is shown to be independent of such modication of the
gauge conditions, just like as in the s-matrix approach the use of this method is justied
by the gauge independence of the scattering matrix.

it is worthwhile to note that exactly the background eld method was used in [5]
in evaluating the quantum corrections to the geodesic equation, as an intermediate
step of which one had to solve the eective equations of motion for the (background)
gravitational eld.
it is, however, the main achievement of the method that these
equations are gauge invariant [11]. as was emphasized in [5], to solve them one is
free to choose any gauge conditions. the solution depends, of course, on this choice,
but this is the ordinary harmless gauge dependence encountered in any classical gauge
theory, which does not lead to gauge dependence of gauge invariant functionals of this
solution. this, however, raises the question which of the two sets of gauge conditions
 the one used to x the gauge freedom of integration variables in the path integral, or
the one used to solve the equations of motion  is to be considered as the gauge xing
for the eective gravitational eld dened in the sense of dalvit and mazzitelli7. it
seems that, in the background eld method, it is the gauge conditions imposed on the
background eld, which are to be considered also as the gauge-xing for the eective
eld, though without detailed proof this is only a probable conjecture.

it should be emphasized, however, that all these are only particularities of the back-
ground eld method itself. we do not use this method in our approach, in which the
gauge freedom of the mean gravitational eld is automatically xed8 by the conditions
imposed on the path integral variables, so the above alternative is never raised. on
the other hand, the questions of method are actually irrelevant to the problem under
consideration, since the very classical nature of the measuring device implies that its
eective action is gauge invariant. thus, if the lowest order contribution to the gauge-
dependent part of the eective device action is zero, then the whole contribution must
be zero too.

let us now proceed to evaluation of the right hand side of eq. (33) in the lowest
order of the weak eld approximation. as the subsequent calculation shows, the result
is linear in the curvature, so the lowest non-vanishing contribution is given by diagrams
with one external graviton, pictured in figs. 1, 2, and 3 representing the rst, second,
and third term in the right hand side of eq. (33), respectively. note that the diagrams
of fig. 3(a,b,c) are obtained from the tree diagrams shown in fig. 4(a,b,c), respectively,
by conuence of pairs of vertices, as shown by the long arrows.

in the rst order approximation, einstein equations read

r + t  = 0,

(34)

7in [5], the two are simply taken to coincide, putting thereby the question o.
8in the case of singular gauge conditions, the gauge xing for the mean eld simply coincides with

that for the integration variables. in general, connection between the two is more complicated.

eq. (9) becomes the ordinary energy-momentum conservation law

(35)

(36)

since all tensor quantities under consideration (t , h etc.) are small, their indices
are raised and lowered with the help of the at-space metric , . remembering
the form of generators of the gauge transformations eq. (14), we see that because of
the conservation law eq. (36), all diagrams of the type shown in fig. 1(f) are equal to
zero.

the ordinary slavnov identities also help us to show that the sum of diagrams in
figs. 2(c) and 2(d) is equal to the diagram pictured in fig. 1(d) for this purpose, we
neglect device contribution, dierentiate eq. (31) twice with respect to  and t ,
and set all the sources, including t , equal to zero

this is the well-known rst slavnov identity from which, in particular, the absence of

tion, identity (37), contracted with t , is shown in fig. 5.

figure 5: graphical representation of the one-loop slavnov identity (37) contracted

makes it clear that the sum of diagrams in figs. 2(c,d) is equal to that pictured in
fig. 1(d). we would like to emphasize that the diagrams 2(c,d) are not equal to zero,
as would be the case if the background eld method were used.

finally, diagrams 1(e) and 3(c) are zeros identically. as for the latter, this follows
simply from the fact that there is no external momentum ow in the dimensionally-
regularized loop integral, while in the former we have 0/0-type indeniteness.
it is
easy to see, however, that this tadpole is to be set zero.
indeed, let the constant
anticommuting source y be considered as the limit of a sequence of functions with
innitely expanding carriers on which the functions have the same constant value except
for immediate neighborhood of the boundaries where they fall o to zero. then the
above indeniteness turns into q3/q2, where q is the tending to zero momentum ow
through the y -vertex.

thus, the diagrams of figs. 1(a,b,c,d), 2(a,b), and 3(a,b) remain to be calculated.
since each diagram contains only one -vertex, two sets of diagrams corresponding
to the two terms in eq. (13) must cancel independently. below we present detailed
calculation of these diagrams with -vertices generated by the mass term. evidently,
one has to expand this term up to the second order in the gravitational eld

the three-graviton vertex encountered in diagrams 1(c), 2(a), and 3(b), need not be
calculated explicitly. indeed, with the help of the identity (38) the graviton propagator
entering the vertex y can be substituted by the ghost propagator, the corresponding
generator d(0)
 being attached to the three-graviton vertex. the latter, therefore, can
be expressed through the second variation of einstein action

as we see, all feynman integrals we need to calculate have the following form

where f (p, k) is the product of the graviton and ghost propagators and of the vertex
factors. since we neglect quantum propagation of the scalar eld, there is no dimen-
sional parameters in the integrands. therefore, as a simple dimensional analysis shows,
i(p) have the following structure

substituting

(46)

all the above feynman integrals are ultraviolet divergent.
it is important, on the
other hand, that they are free of infrared divergences. indeed, denominators in these
integrals are the products of only two scalars  (p + k)2 and k2. if we rewrite also every
p entering the vertex factors as (p + k)  k, then the integrands take the form of sums
of products of powers (p + k)n and km. since all diagrams are ultraviolet divergent,
we have n + m  4. on the other hand, infrared divergences appear only if n  4,
or m  4, and, therefore, we have m  0, or n  0, respectively. in either case the
dimensionally regularized loop integrals turn into zero.
thus, to calculate the logarithmic contribution of the diagrams it is sucient to
nd their ultraviolet divergences. for this purpose, we expand all denominators in a
nite series in powers of p/k keeping only rst n terms.
it is convenient to apply
identity (38) to the y -vertex in all diagrams under consideration, since then such an
expansion is to be performed on the ghost propagator only

now, calculation of diagrams is straightforward. the tensor multiplication as well
as integration over angles in the momentum space is performed with the help of the
new tensor package for reduce system [18]. the result of the calculation is the
following. making use of the gauge condition (12), one can reduce the functional
structure of each diagram to p2h(p)2(p), the coecients being polynomials9 on the

although we have only determined gauge dependence of the eective mass term, this is
enough to conclude that the eective equations of motion of the apparatus depend on
the choice of the gauge. one might think that these equations could still turn out to be
gauge-independent provided that the eective kinetic term had an appropriate gauge-
dependent part, e.g., the one described by equation analogous to eq. (48) with the
same polynomial p tot(, ). remember, however, that besides the terms of the order
h1, whose -dependence is described by eq. (48), the eective apparatus action contains
also terms of the order h0, corresponding to the classical (tree) approximation. the
latter are of course gauge-independent, so there can be no cancellation of the gauge-
dependent factors in the eective equations of motion. obviously, no manipulation with
these equations can change this conclusion, since eq. (48) alone is already sucient
to determine the gauge dependence of the eective gravitational eld.
indeed, as
explained in the introduction, this eld is to be determined by comparison of the
eective and classical equations of motion of the measuring device (or by comparison
of the corresponding action functionals). the mass term in the action (13) for the
scalar particle in a weak gravitational eld is

z d4x

1
2

m22(x)

h(x)

2

.

therefore, in view of arbitrariness of the source t , we conclude that the gauge de-
pendence of the eective gravitational eld measured by means of the scalar particle
is described by the following equation

dhef f
 (x)
d

= ln  t(x)

p tot(, )

82

.

(49)

thus, unlike the case of the point-like measuring apparatus, considered in [5], the value
of the eective gravitational eld measured by the scalar eld turns out to be gauge-
dependent. however, the non-vanishing of the right hand side of eq. (49) should not
discourage, since as we have mentioned in the introduction this result does not take
into account gauge dependence of the radiation corrections to the classical form of the
scalar eld action (i.e., the gravitational form factors of the scalar particle), which in
the case of the gravitational interaction do not disappear in the limit p2/m2  0.

6 conclusion

the results of the calculation presented in this paper show that from the eld-theoretical
point of view, explicit inclusion of the measuring apparatus into mathematical frame-
work of the quantum theory does not solve the problem of gauge dependence of observ-
ables, unlike the case when the eective eld is measured by point particles, discussed
in [5].

21

it must be emphasized, however, that we have obtained this result under assumption
that the action for the measuring device can be taken in the ordinary classical form.
unlike all other fundamental interactions, in the case of gravity this choice of the
action cannot be justied by the standard limiting arguments [9].
in other words,
consistent eld-theoretical approach requires taking into account quantum corrections
to the classical form of the device action, i.e., evaluation of the corresponding form
factors. such evaluation is by itself very complicated task, since one has to deal with
feynman graphs whose external lines all are o the mass-shell. its results would be
decisive for answering the question of whether approach suggested in [5] does solve the
gauge dependence problem.

leaving this question open we would like to note only that its eventual resolution
would serve as a valuable guide in investigation of the fundamental role played by the
measurement process in quantum theory, of which description presented above is just
a phenomenology.

appendix

as we saw in sec. 4, the eective slavnov identities for the combined system grav-
itational eld plus measuring device contain the second derivatives of the generating
functionals of green functions with respect to the sources. if the apparatus contribu-
tion to the eective gravitational eld is innitesimal, this fact is inessential since then
evaluation of the gauge dependence of the generating functional of simply connected
green functions is needed only [see eq. (8)]. however, in the general case of nite
device contribution, one has to deal with the eective slavnov identity for the generat-
ing functional of one-particle-irreducible green functions, i.e., eective action. in this
case, one can avoid the complications caused by the presence of the second derivatives,
which arise when one performs the legendre transformation in eq. (31). this can be
done as follows.

as seen from the derivation of identities (30), (31), given in sec. 4, appearance of the
second derivatives in these identities is traced to non-invariance of the apparatus action
with respect to the quantum brst transformation (18) of integration variables in
the generating functional (21). the rst term in the square brackets in eq. (27),
representing this non-invariance, is non-linear on the quantum elds. on the other
hand, the standard source for the brst transformation of the eld  (the zinn-justin
source, [16]) is linear on the quantum elds, since the generator d() is a functional of
the classical eld  only. in this sense, introduction of the source k into the quantum
action is superuous.
it is natural, therefore, to introduce a source for the brst
variation of the whole device action, instead of the source k. namely, let us consider
the generating functional (21), where  stands for

 = sf p + k d

c +

lf 

cc + j

s

j being the new constant anticommuting parameter. here we consider the general case
when the measuring device is described by an arbitrary number of elds i, denoting
them collectively as . obviously, the new source term is invariant under the quantum
brst transformation (18).

22

to derive the eective slavnov identities, we do as in the beginning of sec. 4 and

obtain the following identity

the rst term in the square brackets is now replaced simply by the minus derivative
with respect to the source j. applying the ghost equation of motion to the second term,
we rewrite eq. (50) as

 t

this is desired eective slavnov identity for the generating functional of one-particle-
irreducible green functions. also, it is easy to verify that upon extraction of the
-dependent terms in eq. (51), the (one-loop) functional  w /j generates just the
set of diagrams in figs. 2, 3.
