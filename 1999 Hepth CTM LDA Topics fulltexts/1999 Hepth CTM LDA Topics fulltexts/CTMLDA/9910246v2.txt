abstract

in this note we describe the most general coupling of abelian vector and tensor
multiplets to six-dimensional (1, 0) supergravity. as was recently pointed out, it is
of interest to consider more general chern-simons couplings to abelian vectors of
the type h r = dbr  1/2 crabaadab, with cr matrices that may not be simultane-
ously diagonalized. we show that these couplings can be related to green-schwarz
r f af b, and how the complete local lagrangian, that embod-
terms of the form brcab
ies factorized gauge and supersymmetry anomalies (to be disposed of by fermion
loops) is uniquely determined by wess-zumino consistency conditions, aside from
an arbitrary quartic coupling for the gauginos.

revised version: december 1999

vector multiplets coupled to variable numbers of tensor multiplets in six-dimensional

(1, 0) supergravity arise naturally in perturbative type-i vacua [1], that are related by

string dualities to non-perturbative heterotic and m-theory vacua. the low-energy eld

equations of these (1, 0) models have revealed the explicit realization of a peculiar aspect

of the physics of branes: singularities in the gauge couplings appear for particular values

of the scalars in the tensor multiplets [2], and can be ascribed to phase transitions [3] in

which a string becomes tensionless [4].

in these models, that arise as parameter-space orbifolds (orientifolds) [5] of k3 re-

ductions of the type-iib string, several antisymmetric tensors take part in a generalized

green-schwarz mechanism [6, 2], and the resulting residual anomaly polynomial has the

form

cr
x cs

y rs trxf 2 tryf 2

,

where the f s denote collectively the riemann curvature and the yang-mills eld strengths,

the cs are a collection of constants (x and y run over the various semi-simple lie factors in

the gauge group and over the lorentz group) and  is the minkowski metric for so(1, n),

with n the number of tensor multiplets. taking into account only the gauge part of the

anomaly polynomial, the corresponding green-schwarz term,

br cx

r trxf 2

,

contains two derivatives, and thus belongs to the low-energy eective action. conse-

quently, the lagrangian has a classical gauge anomaly, that the wess-zumino condi-

tions [7] relate to a classical supersymmetry anomaly [8]. this model is thus rather

dierent from the other supergravities, since it is naturally determined by wess-zumino

conditions, rather than by the usual requirement of local supersymmetry. as a conse-

quence, the supersymmetry algebra contains a two-cocycle, and the resulting lagrangian

is determined up to an arbitrary term proportional to the square of a bilinear in the

gauginos [9]. moreover, the divergence of the energy-momentum tensor is non-vanishing

[10], as is properly the case for a theory that has gauge anomalies but no gravitational

anomalies, that could be accounted for introducing higher-derivative couplings.

1

the coupling of (1, 0) supergravity to n tensor multiplets was originally studied in [11]

to lowest order in the fermi elds, while [12] considered the coupling to a single tensor

multiplet and to vector and hyper-multiplets to all orders in the fermi elds. in this case

the kinetic term is proportional to ae + be [2], where a and b are constants and 

is the scalar in the tensor multiplet, while [12] actually deals with the particular case

a = 0, in which the anomaly polynomial vanishes and no tensionless string transition

occurs. the general coupling to non-abelian vectors and self-dual tensors was worked out

to lowest order in the fermi elds in [2]. in this covariant formulation the requirement of

supersymmetry gives non-integrable equations, and the divergence of the vector equation

gives the covariant anomaly. the same model was then reconsidered again to lowest

order in the fermi elds in [8] in the consistent formulation, requiring the closure of the

wess-zumino conditions, that relate the consistent gauge anomaly to the supersymmetry

anomaly. additional couplings, as well as the inclusion of hyper-multiplets, were then

considered in [13]. the complete coupling to non-abelian vector and tensor multiplets was

nally obtained in [9] in the consistent formulation and in [10] in the covariant formulation.

one can actually consider a slight modication of these couplings, resulting from

the inclusion in the low-energy lagrangian of green-schwarz terms non-diagonal in a

set of u(1) gauge groups. a direct indication of how this can work is provided by a

recent paper of cremmer, julia, lu and pope [14] where, in the search of the highest-

dimensional origin of various three-dimensional scalar sigma models, it is shown that the

oxidation endpoint of three-dimensional supergravity with scalars in f4 sigma models

is (1, 0) six-dimensional supergravity coupled to two tensor multiplets and two abelian

vector multiplets, with non-diagonal chern-simons couplings. the corresponding kinetic

terms are also non-diagonal, compatibly with the abelian gauge invariances. the resulting

model actually motivates the study of more general green-schwarz couplings to abelian

vectors of the form

br cab

r f a f b

,

where the indices a, b run over the dierent u(1) gauge groups, while the symmetric

matrices cr may not be simultaneously diagonalized. in this paper we describe this setting

2

in detail, constructing the general coupling of (1, 0) six-dimensional supergravity to n

tensor multiplets and abelian vector multiplets, and then pointing out the connection

with the particular case considered in [14].

the n scalars in the tensor multiplets parameterize the coset space so(1, n)/so(n),

and are described by the so(1, n) matrix [11]

v =   vr

xm

r ! .

all spinors are symplectic majorana-weyl, the tensorinos m (m = 1, . . . , n) being right-

handed and the gravitino  and the gauginos  being left-handed (we follow the notation

of [9]). the tensor elds br

 are valued in the fundamental representation of so(1, n),

and their eld strengths include generalized chern-simons 3-forms of the vector elds [14]

in the complete theory, the anomaly induced by this term would cancel against the contri-

bution of fermion loops, while the irreducible part of the anomaly polynomial is directly

absent in consistent models [15, 2]. the gauge invariance of h r requires that

the tensor elds satisfy (anti)self-duality conditions, conveniently summarized as [8, 9]

[9], where the complete eld equations for the case of arbitrary numbers of tensor and non-

abelian vector multiplets were obtained requiring the closure of wess-zumino consistency

conditions. the completion to all orders in the fermi elds of the equations of motion is

obtained requiring the closure of the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations

on the fermionic eld equations. all the resulting equations may be conveniently derived

from the lagrangian

after imposing the (anti)self duality conditions. the last term, proportional to the arbi-

trary parameter , vanishes identically in the case of a single abelian vector multiplet.

since the kinetic terms of the vector elds are non-diagonal, this generalization is only

possible in the abelian case.

summarizing, the complete theory would contain additional non-local couplings induced

by fermion loops, whose variation would cancel the anomalous contribution of the con-

tact terms. thus, the low-energy couplings that we are displaying are properly neither

5

gauge-invariant nor supersymmetric. however, gauge and supersymmetry anomalies are

related by wess-zumino consistency conditions, and this grants the coherence of the con-

struction. the presence of the arbitrary parameter  reects the freedom of adding to the

anomaly the variation of a local functional, consistently with all wess-zumino conditions.

this anomalous behavior of the low-energy lagrangian is related to another remarkable

property of these models [9]: aside from local symmetry transformations and the equa-

tion of motion, the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations on the gauginos

generates the two-cocycle

in six dimensions the wess-zumino conditions

close only on the eld equations of the gauginos, and this two-cocycle actually makes

these conditions close for any value of . in the case of a single vector multiplet, in which

the term of the lagrangian proportional to 4 disappears, the two-cocycle is still present,

although it is properly independent of .

although the properties of (anti)self-dual tensors imply that the h 2 term in the la-

grangian vanishes identically, the eld equations obtained varying l are the ones that
result from the supersymmetry algebra when the (anti)self duality conditions are im-

posed. it is possible to apply the construction of pasti, sorokin and tonin (pst) [16]

in this case, following the results of [17], where this construction was applied to the case

of (anti)self-dual tensors coupled to non-abelian vector multiplets, thus generalizing the

results of [18], where only tensor multiplets were considered. since the theory describes

a single self-dual 2-form

where  is an auxiliary scalar eld [16, 18] and h  = h  h. this lagrangian has
pst gauge invariances needed to cancel the additional degrees of freedom [16]. once the

transformations of the gravitino and of the tensorinos are properly modied, the super-

symmetry algebra generates also the pst gauge transformations [18]. the eld equations

obtained from the complete lagrangian reduce to those obtained from the lagrangian

without the pst term, once these gauge invariances are xed [16]. alternative ways of

obtaining a lagrangian formulation for self-dual tensors can be found in the literature.

while in general these involve innite auxiliary elds [19], kavalov and mkrtchyan [20]

had obtained long ago a complete action for pure d=6 (1,0) supergravity in terms of a

single tensor auxiliary eld. their work may be connected to the result of [18] via an

ansatz relating their tensor to the pst scalar.

as supersymmetry does not constrain the values of the coecients cr, we have obtained

a class of models whose anomaly polynomials can contain odd powers of the individual

eld strengths f a. it is interesting to compare these results with [14]. although for generic

values of the cs the so(1, n) global symmetry is broken, the authors of [14] consider the

amusing case of n = 2 with two abelian vector multiplets transforming in the spinorial

representation of so(1, 2). identifying this group with the one that transforms the tensor

elds, one obtains an so(1, 2)-invariant lagrangian if cr = 0r. in particular the results

of [14] correspond to the majorana representation of so(1, 2):

0 = 2

,

1 = i1

,

2 = i3

,

and for this choice the anomaly polynomial vanishes identically.

the transition to tensionless strings corresponds to values of the scalar elds for which

the gauge coupling vanishes [4]. in our lagrangian, this would correspond to the vanishing

of some eigenvalues of the matrix vrcrab. in the case of [14] the moduli space is a two-

dimensional hyperboloid, described by the equation v2

2 = 1, and one can show

0  v2

1  v2

7

that the eigenvalues of the matrix vrcrab are both positive for v0  1 and both negative
for v0  1, so that the transition is not reached.

it is a pleasure to thank d. anselmi and in particular a. sagnotti for useful discussions.
