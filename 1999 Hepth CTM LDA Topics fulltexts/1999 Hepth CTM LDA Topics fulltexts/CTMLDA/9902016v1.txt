notation:

 o - octonions: nonassociative, noncommutative, basis {1 = e0, e1, ..., e7};

 q - quaternions: associative, noncommutative, basis {1 = q0, q1, q2, q3};

 c - complex numbers: associative, commutative, basis {1, i};

 r - real numbers.

 kl, kr - the adjoint algebras of left and right actions of an algebra k on

itself.

 k(2) - 2x2 matrices over the algebra k (to be identied with cliord

algebras);

 cl(p, q) - the cliord algebra of the real spacetime with signature (p+,q-);

 2k - 2x1 matrices over the algebra k (to be identied with spinor spaces);

 ol and or are identical, isomorphic to r(8) (8x8 real matrices),

64-dimensional bases are of the form 1, ela, elab, elabc, or 1, era, erab, erabc,
where, for example, if x  o, then elab[x]  ea(ebx), and erab[x] 
(xea)eb (see [1]);

 ql and qr are distinct, both isomorphic to q, bases

{1 = ql0, ql1, ql2, ql3} and {1 = qr0, qr1, qr2, qr3};

 cl and cr are identical, both isomorphic to c (so we only need use c

itself);

 t = c  q  o, 64-dimensional;

 tl = cl  ql  ol, isomorphic to c(16)  cl(0, 9)  c  cl(0, 8);

 note: the only part of tr missing from tl is qr;

 s = c  q  q  q  o  o  o;

 sl = cl  ql  ql  ql  ol  ol  ol, isomorphic to

c(212)  cl(0, 25)  c  cl(0, 24);

 note: strictly speaking if we tensor q and o 3 times each, then we
should do the same to c, but unlike the former two, 3 tensored copies
of c can easily be reduced to 1 using projection operators without much
evident loss; i wont go into this now, nor am i completely certain that
something might be lost in the simplication of t  t  t down to s, but
its worth it for the time being.

facts (see reference [1]):

 cl  ql(2)  c(4)  c  cl(1, 3), the dirac algebra of (1,3)-spacetime
(the major dierence being that the spinor space, 2(c  q), contains an
extra internal su(2) degree of freedom associated with qr).

 tl(2)  c(25)  c  cl(1, 9), the dirac algebra of (1,9)-spacetime

(spinor space 2t; one internal su(2)).

 sl(2)  c(213)  c  cl(1, 25), the dirac algebra of (1,25)-spacetime

(spinor space 2s; 3 internal su(2)s).

the spinor space of tl(2) can be interpreted as consisting of the direct
sum of a leptoquark family (2 leptons; 2 quarks; 3 colors) and its antifamily
((1,3)-dirac spinors; see [1]). this occurs via a reduction of

cl(1, 9)  cl(1, 3)  (extra bits)

using projection operators. our goal here will be the following: use projection
operators to reduce

(1,25)-spinors  (1,9)-spinors  (1,3)-spinors,

(1)

and see what happens to cl(1, 25) under the corresponding algebraic reduction.
in particular we shall focus on the cl(1, 25) 2-vectors, isomorphic to so(1,25),
and even more particularly we shall focus on the reduction of the transverse
subalgebra so(24), which reduces as follows:

so(24)  so(8)  (extra bits)  so(2)  (more extra bits).

(2)

the extra bits are our penultimate goal.

elements (5), (6) and (7) together for so(24).

in order to accomplish the reduction (1), we need some projection operators
(recall: we are concentrating now on the reduction of the transverse elements,
and in particular on the reduction of the lie algebra so(24) given in (5), (6) and
(7)). dene

where x   t(1)  c  q(1)  o(1), a copy of t in s.

the corresponding action on any u in sl is

u  p u p

(10)

(11)

(note: p is a projection operator, so p 2 = p ). this action reduces the 1-vectors
of cl(0, 24) to the set

pie(1)

l7 q(1)

lr , r = 1, 2; pe(1)

lp , p = 1, ..., 6.

(12)

this is a 1-vector basis for a copy of cl(0, 8), as expected (ie., the transverse
dimensions of (1,25)-spacetime reduce to the transverse dimensions of (1,9)-
spacetime).

the reduction of the 2-vectors (so(24)) is more interesting:

so(24)  so(8)  (u(1)  su(3))(2)  (u(1)  su(3))(3).

(13)

the projection operator (1)

r further reduces the 1-vectors, a reduction
of (1,9)- to (1,3)-spacetime on the full set. the reduced lorentz group, together
with a surviving su(2) from q(1)

r , leaves us with so(1, 25)  so(1, 3) 

l+(1)

(u(1)  su(2)  su(3))(1)  (u(1)  su(3))(2)  (u(1)  su(3))(3).

(14)

the spinor reduction can also be done to t(2) and t(3), each surviving u(1) 
su(2)  su(3) associated with a dierent leptoquark family and antifamily.

these ideas are presented as a mathematical exercise. it has been seen in
other theoretical arenas that mathematical models of physical reality work out
well (resonate with) lorentz spaces of 4, 10 and 26 dimensions. it is at least
interesting that this expansion of a model based on 10 dimensions, already shown
to have a striking correspondence with the standard model of one leptoquark
family, should continue the correspondence in 26 dimensions.

the preceding mathematical development only scratches the surface. con-
tinued development would shed light on many other matters, including inter-
family mixing.
