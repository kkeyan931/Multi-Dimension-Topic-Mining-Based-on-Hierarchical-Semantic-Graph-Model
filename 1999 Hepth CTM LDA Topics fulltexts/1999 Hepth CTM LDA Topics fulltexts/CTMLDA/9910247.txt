(17)-(18) ref. {$9812013$}, satisfy boundary conditions (described eqn. (10)) needed order total surface term variation action vanish. interesting alternative proposed sovoliev {$9905220$}, suggests approach boundary terms require dierentiability action, clear whether completely resolves problem. despite error, however, overall conclusion ref. {$9812013$} remains valid. relevant surface terms analyzed thoroughly, manifestly covariant manner, ref. , shown virasoro algebra ref. {$9812013$} reproduced correct values central charge l0 needed explain black hole entropy. details relation covariant phase space approach ref.  canonical approach ref. {$9812013$} yet worked out, however. moreover, ref.  demonstrates, still unanswered questions concerning proper generic boundary conditions black hole horizon, subject cannot considered closed. error pointed park ho real one, analysis slightly misleading one respect. criticism (b) implicitly assumes nonrotating black hole preferred angular direction, dieomorphisms like eqn.
