abstract

we perform the dual transformation of the yangmills theory in d = 3 dimensions
using the wilson action on the cubic lattice. the dual lattice is made of tetrahedra
triangulating a 3-dimensional curved manifold but embedded into a at 6-dimensional
space (for the su (2) gauge group). in the continuum limit the theory can be refor-
mulated in terms of 6-component gauge-invariant scalar elds having the meaning of
the external coordinates of the dual lattice sites. these 6-component elds induce a
metric and a curvature of the 3-dimensional dual colour space. the yangmills theory
can be identically rewritten as a quantum gravity theory with the einsteinhilbert
action but purely imaginary newton constant, plus a homogeneous matter term. in-
terestingly, the theory can be formulated in a gauge-invariant and local form without
explicit colour degrees of freedom.

1 lattice partition function

though our objective is the continuum theory we start by formulating the su(nc) gauge
theory on a cubic lattice. the partition function can be written as an integral over all link
variables being su(nc) unitary matrices u with the action being a sum over plaquettes,

z() = z ylinks

(1)

dulink exp

 xplaquettes

 (tr uplaq + c.c.) / 2 tr 1


where  is the dimensionless inverse coupling. the unitary matrix uplaq is a product of four
link unitary matrices closing a plaquette.

to get to the continuum limit one writes ulink = exp(iaaa

ta) where a is the lattice spacing
and aa
ta = a is the yangmills gauge potential with ta being the generators of the gauge
group normalized to tr tatb = ab/2, and expands tr uplaq in the lattice spacing a. as a
result one gets for a plaquette lying in the (12) plane:



tr uplaq + c.c.

2 tr 1

=  1  a4 tr f 2

12
2 tr 1

+ o(a6)! ,

(2)

where f = a  a  i[aa] is the yangmills eld strength. summing over all
plaquettes one obtains the partition function of the continuum theory,

zcont = z da exp

with an obvious relation between the dimensionless lattice coupling  and the su(nc) gauge
coupling constant in d dimensions, g2

in this paper we concentrate on the euclidean su(2) yangmills theory in d = 3 dimen-

sions. in this case eq. (4) reads:

(5)

the continuum limit of the d = 3 yangmills theory given by the partition function (1) is
obtained as one takes the lattice spacing a  0 and    with their product g2
3 = 4/(a)
xed. this quantity provides the theory with a mass scale. it is widely believed (though not
proven so far) that the theory possesses two fundamental properties: 1) the average of a large
wilson loop has an area behaviour with a string tension proportional to g4
3, 2) correlation
functions of local operators like f 2
 decay exponentially at large separations, with a mass
gap proportional to g2
3.

our aim will be to rewrite the partition function (1) in dual variables and to study its

continuum limit.

2 dual transformation

the general idea is to integrate over link variables ulink in eq. (1) and to make a fourier
transformation in the plaquette variables uplaq. this will be made in several steps, one for
a subsection.

2.1

inserting a unity into the partition function

first of all, one needs to introduce explicitly integration over unitary matrices ascribed to
the plaquettes, uplaq. this is done by inserting a unity for each plaquette into the partition
function (1):

1 = yplaquettesz duplaq (uplaq , u1u2u3u4)

(6)

where u1...4 are the link variables closing into a given plaquette. the -function is understood
with the group-invariant haar measure. a realization of such a -function is given by wigner
d-functions:

(u, v ) = xj=0, 1

2 ,1, 3

2 ,...

(2j + 1)dj

m1m2(u )dj

m2m1(v ).

(7)

this equation is known as a completeness condition for the d-functions [1]. the main
properties of the d-functions used in this paper are listed in appendix a.

eq. (7) should be understood as follows: if one integrates any function of a unitary matrix
u with the r.h.s. of eq. (7) over the haar measure du one gets the same function but of the
argument v :

z du f (u) (u, v ) = f (v ).

(8)

using the multiplication law for the d-functions (see appendix a, eq. (75)) one can write

down the unity to be inserted for each plaquette in the partition function (1) as

1 = z duplaq xj

(2j + 1) dj

m1m2(u 

plaq)dj

m2m3(u1)dj

m3m4(u2)dj

m4m5(u3)dj

m5m1(u4)

(9)

where u1...4 are the corresponding link variables forming the plaquette under consideration.

2.2

integrating over plaquette variables

integrating over plaquette unitary matrices uplaq becomes now very simple. for each pla-
quette of the lattice one has factorized integrals of the type

tr uplaq + tr u 

plaq

2 tr 1

m1m2(u 

plaq) = m1m2

tj () =

i1()  exp"

2j(j + 1)



# at   .

(11)

the quantity tj () is the fourier transform of the wilson action; since in the lattice
formulation the dynamical variables have the meaning of euler angles and are therefore
compact, the fourier transform depends on discrete values j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, .... however,
as one approaches the continuum limit (  ) the essential values of the plaquette angular
momenta increase as j   and their discreteness becomes less relevant. strictly speaking,
the continuum limit is achieved at plaquette angular momenta j  1.
we would like to make a side remark on this occasion. the quantity tj () gives the
probability that plaquette momenta j is excited, for given . for a typical value used in
lattice simulations  = 2.6 (in 4 dimensions) we nd that the probabilities of having plaquette
excitations with j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2 and 2 are 56%, 29%, 11%, 3% and 1%, respectively. it
means that lattice simulations are actually dealing mainly with j = 0, 1/2 and 1 with a
tiny admixture of higher excitations. it would be important to understand why and how
continuum physics is reproduced by lattice simulations despite only such small values of
plaquette js are involved.

we get, thus, for the partition function:

i1()## of plaquettes

xjp
yplaquettes
m1m2(u1) djp
m2m3(u2) djp



z = " 2
 ylinks lz dul djp

(2jp + 1) tjp ()

m3m4(u3) djp

m4m1(u4)

(12)

where u14 are link variables forming a plaquette with angular momentum jp .

2.3

integrating over link variables

the diculty in performing integration over link variables in eq. (12) is due to the fact
that any link enters several plaquettes.
in d = 2 dimensions every link is shared by two
plaquettes, hence one has to calculate integrals of the type

z dudj1

kl (u)dj2

mn(u ) =

1

2j1 + 1

j1j2 kn lm

(13)

for all links on the lattice. we shall consider this case later, in section 4.

in d = 3 dimensions every link is shared by four plaquettes, hence the integral over link

variables is of the type

z dudja

m1m2(u)djb

m3m4(u)djc

m5m6(u)djd

m7m8(u)

(14)

where ja,b,c,d are angular momenta associated with four plaquettes intersecting at a given
link u, and m18 are magnetic quantum numbers, to be contracted inside closed plaquettes.
in d = 4 dimensions there will be six plaquettes intersecting at a given link but we shall not
consider this case here.

4

figure 1: even cubes in checker board order.

the general strategy in calculating the link integrals (14) is (i) to divide by a certain rule
four d-functions into two pairs and to decompose the pairs of d-functions in terms of single
d-functions using eq. (82) of appendix a, (ii) to integrate the resulting two d-functions
using eq. (13) and, nally, (iii) to contract the magnetic indices. since all magnetic indices
will be eventually contracted we shall arrive to the partition function written in terms of the
invariant 3nj symbols.

there are several dierent tactics how to divide four d-functions into two pairs, even-
tually leading to anything from 6j to 18j symbols. in this paper we take a route used in
refs.[3, 4], leading to a product of many 6j symbols, although on this route one looses certain
symmetries, and that causes diculties later on. the gain, however, is that it is more easy
to work with 6j symbols than with 12j or 18j symbols. since important sign factors have
been omitted in refs.[3, 4] and only nal result has been reported there, we feel it necessary
to give a detailed derivation below.

in d = 3 dimensions all plaquettes are shared by two adjacent cubes, therefore, it is
natural to divide all cubes of the lattice into two classes which we shall call even and odd,
and to attribute plaquettes only to even cubes. we shall call the cube even if its left-lower-
forward corner is a lattice site with even coordinates, (1)x+y+z = +1.
it will be called
odd in the opposite case. the even and odd cubes form a 3-dimensional checker board, as
illustrated in fig.1, where only even cubes are drawn explicitly. the even cubes touch each
other through a common edge or link, as do the odd ones among themselves. the even and
odd cubes have common faces or plaquettes. all plaquettes will be attributed to even cubes
only: that is the reason for the division of cubes into two classes.

let us consider an even cube shown in fig.2.
a, b, c, d, e, f denote its 6 faces, numbers from 1 to 12 denote its links or edges,
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h denote its 8 vertices or sites. correspondingly, we shall denote plaque-
tte angular momenta by jaf , link variables by u112, and the magnetic numbers of the
d-functions will carry indices ah referring to the sites the d-functions are connecting.
one can write the traces of products of four d-functions over plaquettes in various ways.
to be systematic we shall adhere to the following rule: link variables in the plaquette are

taken in the anti-clock-wise order, as viewed from the center of the even cube to which the
given plaquette belongs. if the link goes in the positive direction of the x, y, z axes we ascribe
the u variable to it; otherwise we ascribe the u  variable to it.

with these rules the six plaquettes of the elementary cube shown in fig.2 bring in the

following six traces of the d-function products:

(15)
each link variable u112 appears in this product twice: once as u, the other time as
u . for d(u ) we use eq. (77) of the appendix a to write it in terms of d(u). after
that we can apply the decomposition rule (82) of that appendix to write down pairs of d-
functions in terms of one d-function and two 3jm symbols. the new d-functions correspond
to the links and carry angular momenta which we denote by js. the 3jm symbols have
magnetic indices which get contracted when all indices related to a given corner of the cube
are assembled together. though this exercise is straightforward it is rather lengthy, and we
relegate it to appendix b. as a result we get the following expression which is identically
equal to (15):

here j112 are the angular momenta attached to the links of the cube, (...) are 3jm- and
{...} are 6j-symbols. we see that there is a 6j symbol attached to each corner of the even
cube; its arguments are three plaquette momenta j and three link momenta j intersecting
in a given corner. the 3jm symbols involve only link variables j.

we have, thus, rewritten all twelve pairs of dj-functions entering a cube as a product of
single dj-functions, where js are the new momenta associated with links. it is understood
that this procedure should be applied to all even cubes of the lattice. after that, one has
only two dj-functions of the same link variable u, for all links of the lattice. it becomes,
therefore, straightforward to integrate over link variables, using eq. (13).

it is convenient to integrate simultaneously over six links entering one lattice site, because
in that way one gets a full contraction over all magnetic numbers. the derivation is, again,
straightforward but lengthy: the details are given in appendix c. the result is that the 3jm
factors in eq. (16) are contracted with analogous 3jm symbols arising from neighbouring
even cubes, and produce 6j symbols attached to every lattice site and composed of the six
link momenta j intersecting at a given lattice site.
in notations of fig.3 we get for the
vertices a, b:

a = ( j1

b = ( j1

(17)

and similarly for other vertices. a sign factor (1)2j should be attributed to every link of the
lattice. as shown in appendix c it is actually equivalent to a sign factor (1)2j attributed
to every lattice plaquette.

7

3 lattice partition function as a product of 6j symbols

we summarize here the recipe derived in the previous section. one rst divides all 3-cubes
into two classes, even and odd ones. they form a 3-dimensional checker board depicted in
fig.1. all even cubes are characterized by their plaquette momenta j. the edges of even
cubes have link momenta j; each link is shared by two even cubes.

to each of the eight corners of an even cube one attributes a 6j symbol of the type

j2

( j1
ja jb jc )

j3

(18)

where js are plaquette and js are link momenta intersecting in a given corner of a cube.
the rule is that link 1 is perpendicular to plaquette a, link 2 is perpendicular to plaquette
b and link 3 is perpendicular to plaquette c. four triades, (j1jbjc), (j2jajc), (j3jajb)
and (j1j2j3) satisfy triangle inequalities.

to each lattice site one attributes a 6j symbol of the type

( j1

j4

j2
j5

j3

j6 )

(19)

where js are the six link momenta entering a given lattice site. the rule is that link 4 is
a continuation of link 1 lying in the same direction, link 5 is a continuation of link 2 and
link 6 is a continuation of link 3. four triades, (j1j2j3), (j1j5j6), (j2j4j6) and (j3j4j5) satisfy
triangle inequalities.

actually, each lattice site has ve 6j symbols ascribed to it: four are originating from
the corners of the even cubes adjacent to the site and are of the type (18), and one is of the
type (19).

the lattice partition function (1) or (12) can be identically rewritten as a product of the
6j symbols described above. independent summation over all possible plaquette momenta j
and all possible link momenta j is understood. we write the partition function in a symbolic
form:

z = " 2

the plaquette weights tj () are given by eq. (11). apart from the sign factor essentially the
same expression was given in refs. [3, 4] 1. the sign factor is equal to 1 if the total number
of half-integer plaquettes js is even (odd). since plaquettes with half-integer momenta form
closed surfaces it may seem that the sign factor can be omitted. in a general case, however,
when one consideres vacuum averages of operators this is not so, therefore, it is preferable
to keep the sign factor.

1we are grateful to p.pobylitsa who has independently derived eq. (20).

4 simple example: d = 2 yangmills

in a simple exactly soluble case of the 2-dimensional su(2) theory every link is shared by
only two plaquettes. therefore, the link integration is of the type given by eq. (13):
it
requires that all plaquettes on the lattice have identical momenta j. the partition function
thus becomes a single sum over the common j:

z = " 2



i1()## of plaquettes

xj

[tj ()]# of plaquettes ,

(21)

the number of plaquettes being equal to v /a2 where v is the full lattice volume (full area
in this case) and a is the lattice spacing.

a slightly less trivial exercise is to compute the average of the wilson loop. let the

along the loop. one gets therefore integrals of two d-functions outside and inside the loop,
and integrals of three d-functions for links along the loop. the rst integral says that all
plaquettes outside the loop are equal to a common j. the second integral says that all
plaquettes inside the loop are equal to a common j . integrals along the loop require that
j, j  and js satisfy the triangle inequality. we have thus for the average of the wilson loop
of area s:

j =|jjs| [tj () / tj()]

s

(22)

hwjs(s)i = pj [tj ()]

this is an exact expression for the lattice wilson loop, however we wish to explore its
continuum limit. it implies that v /a2  , s/a2   but s  v ;   , a  0 but
a2 = 4/g2
2 is the physical coupling constant having the dimension of mass2,
see eq. (4).

we take v /a2   rst of all, which requires that only the j = 0 term contributes to
the sum, with t0()  1; consequently all momenta inside the loop are that of the source,
j  = js. taking into account the asymptotics (11) of tj () at large  we obtain

hwjs(s)i = [tjs()]

which is, of course, the well-known area behaviour of the wilson loop with the string tension
proportional to the casimir eigenvalue.

5 dual lattice: tetrahedra and octahedra

we now turn to the construction of the dual lattice.

each 6j symbol of the exact partition function (20) encodes four triangle inequalities
between the plaquette js and the link js. it is therefore natural to represent all 6j symbols
by tetrahedra whose six edges have lengths equal to the six momenta of a given 6j symbol.
four faces of a tetrahedron form four triangles, so that the triangle inequalities for the
momenta are satised automatically.

figure 5: octahedron dual to the even cube.

let us rst consider the eight 6j symbols corresponding to the eight corners of an even
cube. these eight 6j symbols are given explicitly in eq. (16) with notations shown in fig.2.
let us represent all of them by tetrahedra of appropriate edge lengths. for example, the
tetrahedra corresponding to the corners a and b are shown in fig.4. we denote the plaquette
momenta ja, ... just by their latin labels a, b, ... and the link momenta j1, j2, ... by their
numerical indices 1, 2, ... we notice immediately that the two tetrahedra have a pair of equal
faces, in this case it is the triangle (a, b, 1). therefore, we can glue the two tetrahedra
together so that this triangle becomes their common face. the gluing can be done in two
ways. to be systematic we shall always glue tetrahedra so that their volumes do not overlap.
in the same way we glue together other tetrahedra. being glued together the eight
tetrahedra of the cube form an octahedron shown in fig.5. its center point o is connected
with six lines to the vertices denoted as af ; the lengths of these lines are equal to the
corresponding plaquette momenta jaf . the external twelve edges of the octahedron have

10

figure 6: a tetrahedron corresponding to the lattice site ts precisely into a hole between
four octahedra corresponding to the four corners of the even cubes adjacent to the site
(shown in motion).

lengths equal to the link momenta j112. the eight faces of the octahedron correspond to
the eight vertices of the original even cube. one can say that the octahedron is dual to the
cube: the faces become vertices and vice versa; the edges remain edges.

it is clear that in a case of generic js and js the octahedron cannot be placed into a
at 3-dimensional space. indeed, we have 6+12 = 18 given momenta, that is xed lengths,
but only 7 points dening the octahedron, including the center one. in three dimensions
that gives 21 d.o.f. from which one has to subtract 3+3 to allow for rigid translations and
rotations. therefore, we are left with only 15 d.o.f.
[in four
dimensions the arithmetic would match: 7  4  4  6 = 18.]
each even cube of the original lattice has twelve neighbouring even cubes sharing edges
with the rst one, and with themselves. if we represent the neighbour even cubes by their
own dual octahedra those will also share common edges. does this network of octahedra
cover the space? no, there are holes in between. however, we have not used yet the 6j
symbols (19) made solely of the link momenta js.
if we represent these 6j symbols by
tetrahedra their triangle faces will coincide with the faces of the octahedra corresponding to
the even cubes adjacent to the site. for example, if we consider the 6j symbols corresponding
to the site a (see fig.3 and eq. (17)),

instead of the needed 18.

it has a common triangle face (j1, j4, j12) with the octahedron shown in fig.5. the other
faces of this tetrahedron match the octahedra dual to the cubes ii, iii and iv , see fig.3.
octahedra corresponding to the cubes supplemented by tetrahedra corresponding to the
lattice sites cover the space without holes and therefore serve as a simplicial triangulation,
see fig.6.

an equivalent view on the dual lattice has been suggested in ref. [3]. one can connect
centers of neighbour cubes (both even and odd) and ascribe plaquette momenta js to these

lines. the link momenta js will be then ascribed to diagonal lines connecting only even
neighbour sites of that dual lattice, see fig.7.

the dual lattice can be understood in two senses. on one hand, one can build a regular
cubic dual lattice with additional face diagonals like shown in figs.6 and 7, and ascribe js
and js to its edges. on the other hand, since variables living on the links of the dual lattice
are positive numbers, one can build a lattice with the lengths of edges equal to the appropriate
angular momenta. we shall always use the dual lattice in this second sense.

6 coordinates of the dual lattice as new variables

in the previous section we have already met with a situation when an octahedron dual to
a cube did not t into a 3-dimensional at space: at least four dimensions were necessary.
as one enlarges the triangulated complex more dimensions are needed to match the number
of degrees of freedom. in the limiting case of an innite lattice one needs 6 at dimensions.
this number of dimensions follows from the number of d.o.f. one has to accommodate: at
each lattice site there are three plaquette momenta j and three link momenta j, and there
is a one-to-one correspondence between lattice sites and the cubes.

therefore, the dual lattice (understood in the second sense, see above) spans a 3-
dimensional manifold which can be embedded into a 6-dimensional at space. notice that it
is the maximal number of at dimensions needed to embed a general 3-dimensional rieman-
nian manifold; it can be counted from the number of components of the metric tensor, which
is 6 in three dimensions. only very special congurations of js and js would be possible
to embed into a at space of less dimensions.

we are primarily interested in the continuum limit of the lattice theory, that is in the

small a, large  case. it implies that large angular momenta j   are involved, and one

can pass from summation over js and js to integration over these variables in the partition
function (20). we replace

xj=0,1/2,1,...

(2j + 1)...  2z 

0

dj 2... ,

(24)

and similarly for the summation over link momenta js.

12

the next step is to ascribe a 6-dimensional lorentz scalar eld w(x),  = 1, ..., 6 to
the centers of all cubes of the original lattice, see fig.7. we shall call them coordinates
of the dual lattice. they are scalars because in three dimensions the cubes are scalars.
the argument of the six-component scalar eld is the coordinate of the center of the cube
in question, however, we shall consider w(x) as continuous functions. since six functions
depend only on three coordinates there are three relations between w(x) at any point; these
relations dene a curved 3-dimensional manifold whose triangulation is given by the set of
js and js.

we next dene six-dimensional angular momenta as dierences of w(x) taken at the

centers of neighbour cubes:

j 

x (cid:18)x +

a
2

, y, z(cid:19) = w(x + a, y, z)  w(x, y, z) = axw +

a

, y, z +

2(cid:19) = w(x + a, y, z)  w(x, y, z + a) = a(x  z)w + o(a2), (25)

and so on. the lengths of these 6-vectors are, by construction, the lengths of the edges of
the dual lattice.

the six functions w(x) can be called external coordinates of the manifold; they induce

a metric tensor of the manifold determined by

gij(x) = iwjw.

as usual in dierential geometry one can dene the christoel symbol,

i,jk(x) =

1
2

(jgik + kgij  igjk) = iwjkw  (wi  wjk),

and the riemann tensor,

rijkl(x) =

1
(jkgil + ilgjk  jlgik  ikgjl) + m,jkm
2
= [(wik  wjl)  gpq(wp  wik) (wq  wjl]  [k  l].

il  m,jlm

ik

the contravariant tensor is inverse to the covariant one,

gijgjk = i
k,

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

and can be used to rise indices, and for contractions. the determinant of the metric tensor
is

g = det gij =

1
3!

ijk lmn(wi  wl) (wj  wm) (wk  wn),

and the contravariant metric tensor is

gij =

1
2g

ikljmn(wk  wm) (wl  wn).

(30)

(31)

there is a useful identity for the antisymmetrized product of two contravariant tensors, valid
in 3 dimensions:

13

the scalar curvature is obtained as a full contraction:

gikgjl  gilgjk = ijm kln gmn / g.

(32)

r = gik gjl rijkl =

(gik gjl  gil gjk) rijkl

2g2 ijkij k

=

(wk wk)[2g (wii  wjj )plmqlm

(wp wii)(wq wjj )(wl wl)(wm wm)]. (33)
recalling that w is a 6-dimensional vector we can rewrite the scalar curvature in another
form:

r =

pll

qmm

w

i w

i w

j w 

j  w

k w 

k w

(34)

this form makes it clear that the scalar curvature is zero if w has only three nonzero
components, which corresponds to a at 3-dimensional manifold.

finally, we would like to point out the jacobian for the change of integration variables
from the set of the lengths of the tetrahedra edges, j 2
i given at all lattice sites, to the
external coordinates w. in the continuum limit this jacobian is quite simple. it is given by
the determinant of a 6  6 matrix composed of the second derivatives:

i and j2

dw(x) jac(w),

jac(w) = det w
ij.

(35)

ij = w

since w
ji there are actually six independent second derivatives. the jacobian is zero
in the degenerate case when the triangulation by tetrahedra can be embedded in less than
6 dimensions.

7 continuum duality transformation and bianchi iden-

tity

it is instructive at this point to compare the duality transformation on the lattice with that
in the continuum theory. the continuum partition function (3) can be written with the help
of an additional gaussian integration over the dual eld strength, j a
ij:

z = z dj a

(36)

eq. (36) is usually called the rst-order formalism.

in the abelian case when the ai commutator term is absent, integration over ai results

in the -function of the bianchi identity,

ijij = 0,

or

ijkijk = 0,

jk =

1
2

ijkjij.

(37)

because of this identity, one can parametrize jk = kw, and get for the partition function:

14

zabel = z dw expz d3x"

g2

(kw)2# .

(38)

it represents a theory of a free massless scalar eld w. it is in accordance with that in a 3d
abelian theory there is only one physical (transverse) polarization. it is easy to check that
gauge-invariant correlation functions of eld strengths coincide with those computed in the
original formulation.

notice that the second term in the exponent is purely imaginary; the full partition function
is real because for each conguration j a
i (x), which
adds a complex conjugate expression.

i (x) there exists a conguration with j a

we now turn to the discretized version of the dual theory. as explained above, we
need 6 at dimensions to embed the dual lattice, and we have introduced 6-dimensional
momenta j , see eq. (25). these momenta apparently satisfy, e.g., the identity (see fig.7
for notations):

(39)

(40)

(41)

j

2(cid:19)  j 

, y, z + a(cid:19) ,

a

= j 

and similarly for other components. this is nothing but a discretized version of the bianchi
identity,

ijkij 

k = 0,

 = 1, ..., 6.

(42)

therefore, in 6 dimensions one recovers the simple (at) form of the bianchi identity for
the dual eld strength. one can say that the complicated (nonlinear) form of the usual
non-abelian bianchi identity is a result of the projection of the at bianchi identity onto
the curved colour space.

8 wilson loop

in this section we present the wilson loop in the representation js,

wjs =

1

2js + 1

tr p exp ii dxiaa

i t a,

15

(43)

in terms of dual variables.

in terms of the original lattice the wilson loop corresponds to adding a product of the
djs(u) functions to all links along the loop, with a chain contraction of magnetic indices.
because of these insertions, on links containing the loop one has to integrate over three d-
functions instead of two as for all other links. as a result one gets additional 3jm symbols
along the loop which combine into the new 9j symbols ascribed to all lattice sites, see
appendix d. for example, the 9j symbols ascribed to vertices a and b are (for notations see
fig.3):

j4

b =

(44)




the accompanying sign factors are given in appendix d. six triades of the 9j symbol,
corresponding to all its rows and columns, satisfy the triangle inequalities.

contrary to the 6j symbol the 9j symbol cannot be represented by a geometrical gure
with edges equal to the entries of the 9j symbol. in addition, the link momenta along the
loop split now into pairs: j1 and j
17, and so on. the primed and
non-primed angular momenta satisfy triangle inequalities, with the source js being the third
edge of the triangles. if js is an integer, there is always a contribution with j
1 = j1 (and so
on). if js is a half-integer one has necessarily j

15, j17 and j

1, j15 and j

thus, there appears to be a fundamental dierence between wilson loops in integer and
half-integer representations. for integer representations one can proceed as in the vacuum
case and parametrize the dual lattice sites by the coordinates w(x) related to angular
momenta through eq. (25). in the half-integer case one cannot uniquely parametrize the
dual lattice by the coordinates w(x). in the presence of the wilson loop in a half-integer
representation the dual space w is not simply connected: there is a innitely thin cylindrical
hole in the dual space along the loop.

1 6= j1.

9 asymptotics of the 6j symbols

j, j   one can replace 6j symbols by their asymptotics.
in the continuum limit   ,
the asymptotics was ingeniously guessed in a seminal paper by ponzano and regge [6] and
later on explicitly derived and improved by schulten and gordon [7]. the results of these
works can be summarized as follows.

first of all one draws a tetrahedron with edges equal to jn + 1

momenta of a given 6j symbol.
satisfy triangle inequalities, the same triades shifted by 1
symbol is said to be classically forbidden, and it is exponentially suppressed at large jn.

2, where jn are the six
it should be stressed that though four momenta triades
in that case the 6j

2 need not.

if jn lie in the classically allowed region, the asymptotics is given by the ponzanoregge

formula:

( j1

q12v (j)

cos"xn (cid:18)jn +

4# .

(45)

16

here v (j) is the 3-dimensional volume of the tetrahedron and n is the dihedral angle in the
tetrahedron, corresponding to the edge jn + 1
2. since we are interested in the large-jn limit
we shall systematically neglect the shifts by 1
2. the tetrahedron volume can be found from
the cayley formula:

v (j)2 =

(48)

is the area of the triangle built on the edges j1,2,3. the dihedral angles are dened such that
0    . since in section 6 we have dened 6-dimensional angular momenta j whose
lengths are the edges of the tetrahedra, we can nd the dihedral angles from more simple
formulae involving scalar products of momenta in the 6-dimensional space. for example,
eq. (47) can be rewritten as

cos 1 =

(j1  j2)(j1  j6)  j2
1 (j2  j6)
2  (j1  j2)2 qj2
1 j2
1 j2
6  (j1  j6)2

qj2

.

(49)

notice that the angle is dened to be equal to  (not 0!) when the two vectors, j2 and j6
coincide; it is zero when they point in the opposite directions. we shall use this formula in
what follows.

10 angle defect

the yangmills partition function (20) is a product of many 6j symbols for each of which
we use the asymptotic form (45) in approaching the continuum limit. each cosine can be
written as a half-sum of exponents of imaginary argument. therefore, we have to consider
a sum of a product of many imaginary exponents,

cos(n) =

n

yn

1

2n x{n=1}

exp ixn

nn! ,

(50)

where n denotes the argument of the cosine in eq. (45), for the nth 6j symbol, and one has
to sum over all signs n = 1.
the expression in the exponent of eq. (50) can be rearranged as follows: we rst pick
one of the edges of the dual lattice, whose length is a link jl or a plaquette jp , and combine

17

all dihedral angles n related to this edge, as coming from the nth tetrahedron. we then sum
over all edges of the dual lattice. therefore, we can write:

xn

nn = xp

jp   4
xn=1

nn(jp )! +xl

jl  6
xn=1

nn(jl)! ,

n = 1.

(51)

as seen, e.g., from fig.7, each plaquette j enters four tetrahedra, therefore the corresponding
sum over n in eq. (51) goes from 1 to 4. each link j enters six tetrahedra, therefore in this
case the sum is over six dihedral angles n(j), with appropriate signs n.

let us consider the contribution to eq. (50) when all signs n = +1, and let us for a
moment assume that the dual lattice spans a 3-dimensional euclidean manifold. the sum
of the dihedral angles about an edge is then equal to 4  2 = 2 in case of summing over
four tetrahedra, and equal to 6  2 = 4 in case of summing over six tetrahedra. in the
rst case we get exp(2ij) = (1)2j ; in the second case we get exp(4ij) = (1)4j = +1.
notice that the sign factor (1)2j compensates exactly the same factor in the partition
function (20). we conclude that, if the conguration of the momenta is at, there exists a
contribution to the sum (50) that does not oscillate with varying js and js. in fact, there
are exactly two such contributions corresponding to taking all signs n = 1 simultaneously.
contributions of any other choice of the signs are oscillating fast at large js and js, and
thus die out in the continuum limit.

a generic conguration of momenta cannot be embedded into a at 3-dimensional space,
however. therefore, the sum of dihedral angles about the edges j and j will, generally, dier
from 2 and 4, respectively. these dierences are sometimes called angle deciencies or
angle defects (we shall use the second term). let us denote them:

(j) =

(j) =

4

6

xn=1
xn=1

n(j)  2,

n(j)  4.

(52)

(53)

our task is to point out contributions to eq. (50) that survive the continuum limit in a
general case when the dual lattice is a curved 3-dimensional manifold. to be more precise,
we have to consider the sum of all momenta on the lattice times their angle defects,

exp i"xp

jp (jp ) +xl

jl(jl)# ,

(54)

and to nd the contribution of the order of a3 to this exponent, where a is the lattice
spacing. the o(a3) order is needed to compensate for the 1/a3 factor arising as one goes
from summation over the lattice points to integration over the 3-dimensional space.

in the continuum limit we assume that the momenta are given by the gradients of a 6-
component function w(x) having the meaning of the 6-dimensional coordinates of the dual
lattice sites, see eq. (25). if we restrict ourselves to the rst terms in the gradient expansion
in eq. (25), the momenta will be expressed only through three vectors, xw, yw and
zw. three vectors dene a at 3-dimensional space; therefore, the angle defects  are

18

zero in the rst-derivative approximation. to get a non-zero angle defect it is necessary to
expand the momenta in eq. (25) up to the second derivatives of w. we shall see that it is
also sucient in three dimensions.

since the angle defects s vanish if js are taken to the rst approximation of the gradient
expansion, it means that the expansion of s starts from terms linear in the lattice spacing
a. according to eq. (25) the expansion of the momenta also starts from terms linear in
a. therefore, one can expect that the expansion of the exponent in eq. (54) starts from
the o(a2) terms. were that so, the conguration would be too ultraviolet and would not
survive the continuum limit. fortunately, there appears to be an exact cancellation of all
o(a2) terms in the sum over several neighbour edges of the dual lattice, so that the exponent
in eq. (54) proves to be nite in the continuum limit.

we next embark a rather tedious enterprise of calculating the angle defects about six
plaquette js in a cube (each entering four tetrahedra), and about twelve link js being
edges of that cube (each involved in six tetrahedra, see section 5). unluckily, it seems that
it is the minimal elementary group that is being repeated through the lattice.
it means
that we have to compute as much as 6  4 + 12  6 = 96 dihedral angles, expressing them
through the rst and second gradients of the 6-component function w using eqs. (25, 49).
this formidable calculation has been performed by heavily exploiting mathematica. the
intermediate results are very lengthy and we do not present them here. however, the nal
result is beautiful. from a direct calculation we obtain:

exp i"xp

jp (jp ) +xl

jl(jl)# = exp i xpoints x

a3 1
2qg(w) r(w)
2 z d3x qg(w) r(w),

i

= exp

(55)

where g is the determinant of the induced metric tensor as given by eq. (30), and r is the
corresponding scalar curvature given by eq. (33). actually, we obtain the expression for the
l.h.s. of eq. (55) in the form of eq. (33) (written in components, 384 terms!) from where we
recognize that we are dealing with the scalar curvature.

in fact this result is a concrete realization of a more general theory developed many years
ago by regge [6, 8]. in these papers it was shown that the l.h.s. of eq. (55) should be equal
to its r.h.s. for any simplicial triangulation, provided it has a smooth continuum limit. no
relation of the scalar curvature r to any concrete triangulation was given, though. we feel
that it is the rst time that this ingenious relation has been derived explicitly for a concrete
triangulation, and the continuum limit shown to exist.

11 full partition function

having dealt with the 6j symbols of the partition function (20) we now turn to the weight
factors tj (). according to eq. (11) at large  and j we have:

yplaquettes

tj () = exp

(56)

where the relation (5) between  and the physical coupling constant g2
3 has been used,
together with the gradient expansion for the angular momenta (25). combining eqs. (55,
56) and using iwiw = gii(w) we get nally for the yangmills partition function:

(57)

the second term is the einsteinhilbert action with a purely imaginary newton constant;
it is invariant under global 6-dimensional rotations of the external coordinates w(x) and,
more important, under local 3-dimensional dieomorphisms w(x)  w(x(x)).

the rst term in eq. (57) can be viewed as a matter source,

g2
3

2 z d3x gii = 

g2
3

2 z d3xg t ijgij,

(58)
with the stress-energy tensor t ijg = ij violating the invariance under dieomorphisms.
since it is homogeneous in space it can be called the ether.



the functional measure in eq. (57) arises from two sources. one factor is the jacobian
for the change of variables from the tetrahedra edges js and js to w, see eq. (35). the
other factor arises from the tetrahedra volumes in the asymptotics of the 6j symbols (45).

in the continuum limit the tetrahedron volume can be written as v (j)  g, and there are

5 tetrahedra per lattice site, see section 3.

once the partition function is written in covariant terms one can forget the origin of
the external coordinates w (as the coordinates of the dual lattice) and consider the metric
tensor gij as independent dynamical variables over which one integrates in eq. (57). the
jacobian for this change of variables can be easily worked out:
in fact it is the inverse of
jac(w) introduced in eq. (35). as a result we get the integration measure for the partition
function (57):

z dgij g2,

(59)

z dgij g 5

4 ,

instead of

which would be the invariant measure in 3d. we shall get an independent check of the power
 5
4 in the next section. however, it is anyhow a local counterterm not aecting the physics.
we stress that the partition function written in terms of the metric tensor does not
contain explicit colour degrees of freedom. nevertheless, implicitly the theory does
contain three gluons at short distances.

indeed, let us make a simple dimensional analysis of eq. (57). the dimension of the rst
term in eq. (57) is g2
32w2 (we are just counting the number of derivatives and the overall
power of w); the dimension of the second term is 3w1. at short distances where quantum
uctuations of w(x) vary fast, the second term dominates the rst one. meanwhile, the
second term is a fast-oscillating functional at nonzero r. therefore, the leading contribution
to the functional integral arises from zero-curvature uctuations of w, that is essentially
from the 3-dimensional w. being plugged into the rst term, the three components of
w describe three massless scalar elds. these elds correspond to three gluons of su(2)
with one physical (transverse) polarization.
it should be paralleled to eq. (38) for free

20

electrodynamics. this is the correct result for the non-abelian theory at short distances in
three dimensions.

at large distances or at low eld momenta the dominant term is, on the contrary, the
rst one as it has less derivatives. it describes six (instead of three) massless scalar degrees
of freedom.
it is the correct number of gauge-invariant degrees of freedom in the su(2)
theory. however, the theory remains strongly nonlinear, and it is not clear so far whether
massless modes survive in the physical spectrum.

12 quantum gravity from rst-order continuum for-

malism

in this section we give another derivation of the partition function (57) directly in the
continuum theory starting from the rst-order formalism, see section 7. we shall show that
the two terms in the exponent of eq. (36) are in fact in one-to-one correspondence with the
two terms in eq. (57), and that the integration measure coincides with that of eq. (59).

actually, it has been already derived in the previous section that the rst terms of

eqs. (36) and (57) are equal:

g2
3

s1 = 

2 z d3x (j a

i )2 = 

2 z d3x iwiw = 

g2

let us derive a less trivial relation for the second terms:

2 z d3x gii.

s2 =

i

2 z d3x ijk j a

i (jaa

k  kaa

j + abc ab

jac

k) =

i

2 z d3x gr.

(60)

(61)

this derivation will be done in two steps. we shall rst show, following witten [9], that
the l.h.s. of eq. (61) can be presented as a certain chernsimons term. second, we shall
show that it is formally equal to the einsteinhilbert action. a subtle question about the
integration measure will be discussed at the end of the section.

the l.h.s. of eq. (61) is apparently invariant under ordinary gauge transformations:

where dab

i (a) = iab + acb ac

aa

i = iabb + abc bac

i (a)b,
i is the covariant derivative.

i = dab

j a

i = abc bj c
i ,

(62)

less evident, it is also invariant under the following local transformation:

indeed, after integrating by parts we obtain the following variation of the action:

j a

i = ia  abc bac
i ,

aa

i = 0.

jk = 0.

this variation is zero owing to the bianchi identity, ijk dab

the two transformations combined form a 6-parameter gauged poincare group, called
iso(3). indeed, let us introduce three momenta generators pi and three angular momenta
generators li satisfying the poincare algebra,

21

[pa pb] = 0,

[la lb] = iabc lc,

[la pb] = iabc pc.

we next introduce a 6-component vector eld bi:

bi = j a

i pa + aa

i la  b

i t ,

t  = ( pa,

la,

 = a = 1, 2, 3,

 = 3 + a = 4, 5, 6.

its gauge transformation has the standard form:

bi  s1 bis + is1is,

s = exp[iapa + iala].

(65)

(66)

(67)

using the poincare algebra (65) it is easy to check that its innitesimal form coincides with
eqs. (62, 63).

since the l.h.s. of eq. (61) is invariant under these 6-parameter transformations, it can be
rewritten in an explicitly iso(3)-invariant form. to that end we notice that the invariant
tensor of this group is

m =   0 1

1 0 ! ,

(68)

where 1 is a unit 3  3 matrix. this matrix denes a scalar product, bm c , which is
invariant under global (x-independent) transformations (67). with the help of this invariant
tensor we build a local gauge-invariant action having the form of the chernsimons term:

using the denition (66) it is easy to check that eq. (69) coincides with the l.h.s. of eq. (61),
however it is explicitly invariant under the 6-parameter gauge transformation (67).

eq. (69) has the form of the chernsimons term in a yangmills theory. though our
derivation above is for the gauge group su(2) it is trivially generalized to any lie group:
to that end it is sucient to replace the su(2) structure constants abc by the structure
constants fabc of the gauge group under consideration. we also note in passing that in
four dimensions the mixed ij a
(a) term of the rst-order formalism also posseses an
additional local symmetry. to unveil it, it is sucient to replace the scalar parameter a
in the transformation (63) by a 4-vector parameter a
: the invariance is again due to the
bianchi identity, this time in four dimensions.

i . finally, one notices that, if one makes an identication of the
i , and of the connection with the yangmills
i , then eq. (72) takes exactly the form of the l.h.s. of eq. (61). this parallel

i = j a

i = aa

there is a subtle point in this formal derivation, however. the use of the rst-order
formalism implies that one integrates both over j a
i (see eq. (36)) or, equivalently,
over the dreibein and over the connection, independently. meanwhile, the use of the einstein
quantum gravity implies that the connection is rigidly related to the dreibein via eq. (71),
moreover, we have explicitly used this relation in the above derivation. in ref. [9] witten has
presented arguments that one can, nevertheless, integrate over the connection as independent
variable. however, the arguments rely upon the use of the equations of motion (one of which
is the relation (71)), and that might be dangerous in full quantum eld theory.

i and over aa

the present paper gives a dierent kind of argument that the two approaches are in fact
equivalent. we start with the yangmills partition function. on one hand it can be presented
in the rst-order formalism where one integrates independently over j a
i (the dreibein) and
over aa
i (the connection). on the other hand we have shown that the yangmills theory
is equivalent to quantum gravity where one integrates over the external coordinates w, or
over the metric tensor, or over the dreibein only.

since pure gravity can be rewritten as a chernsimons term (69), it is actually a topo-
logical eld theory [9], with no real propagating particles. it is the ether term that violates
the invariance under dieomorphisms and restores the propagation of gluons, as it should
be in the yangmills theory, see the end of the previous section.

finally, we would like to remark that the integration measure (59) could be anticipated
from the rst-order formalism as well.
i one gets
eq. (40), where the integration measure over the dreibein is (det j)3/2  g3/4. the jaco-
bian for the change of variables from the dreibein to the metric tensor is dea
i  dgij g1/2.
adding the powers we obtain:  3

indeed, integrating in eq. (39) over aa

4 , as in eq. (59).

13 conclusions and outlook

in this paper, we have studied the dual transformation of the su(2) yangmills theory in 3
dimensions, both from the continuum and lattice points of view.

on the lattice, one can introduce dual variables being the angular momenta of the pla-
quettes (js) supplemented by those associated with the links (js). the partition function
can be identically rewritten as a product of 6j symbols made of those angular momenta. a
wilson loop corresponds to taking a product of 9j symbols replacing the 6j symbols along
the loop. one can construct a dual lattice made of tetrahedra whose edges have the lengths
equal to js and js; the tetrahedra span a 3d curved manifold which can be embedded into
a at 6d space.

in the continuum limit the angular momenta are large, and we have introduced continuum
6d euclidean external coordinates w(x) to describe the curved dual space. the bianchi

23

condition for the yangmills eld strength has been shown to be trivially soluble in at six
dimensions.

at large angular momenta one can use the asymptotics of the 6j symbols, given by
ponzano and regge. using a specic simplicial triangulation of the dual space (as dictated
by the original lattice) we have shown that the product of the 6j symbols does have a
smooth continuum limit which appears to be the einsteinhilbert action, with the metric
tensor gij and the scalar curvature r expressed through the at external coordinates w(x).
this result cannot be considered as particularly new (it is the cornerstone of the regges
simplicial gravity), however, to our best knowledge it is the rst time that the result has
been explicitly derived from a concrete triangulation of the curved space, and the continuum
limit shown to exist. we have also found the integration measure for the continuum limit.
the continuum yangmills partition function can be rewritten as a quantum gravity
theory but with an ether term violating the invariance in respect to general coordinate
transformations or dieomorphisms. this term, however, revives gluons at short distances,
in contrast to the topological pure gravity theory where no particles propagate.

the presentation of the yangmills theory in a quantum gravity form (57) is explicitly
colour gauge-invariant since the metric tensor of the dual space is colour-neutral. we have,
thus, formulated the yangmills theory solely in terms of colourless glueball degrees of
freedom 2. it turns out to be an interacting theory of six massless scalar elds. nevertheless,
at small distances it correctly reproduces the propagation of gluons. it is not clear to us
at the moment how to proceed best in order to reveal its large-distance behaviour. let us
indicate a few possibilities.

one possibility is to exploit the fact that the pure quantum gravity theory is topological,
3 about

therefore essentially a free theory. one can try to make a perturbative expansion in g2
it.

another possibility is to make use of the fact that the chern-simons term (69) can
be obtained from integrating over heavy fermions, in this case belonging to some iso(3)
representation. the subsequent integration over bosonic elds ai, ji is trivial since there is
no kinetic energy term for those elds: the result would be a local four-fermion theory with
innitely heavy fermions; it might be soluble, at least in the large-nc limit.

probably the most promising possibility is to pursue the analogy with and methods of
quantum gravity. one can average eq. (57) over 3d dieomorphisms: the second term is
invariant, the rst term is not.
integrating the rst term over dieomorphisms produces
dieomorphism-invariant eective action containing growing powers in the curvature. the
eective action may lead to a nonzero v.e.v. of the scalar curvature, and that may yield
a mass gap for the dieomorphism-non-invariant correlation functions, like the correlation
functions of f 2

.

there are several other tasks for the future, lying on the surface. first, it would be
interesting to generalize the present approach to colour groups other than su(2). in view of
the sad fact that the theory of the 6j symbols for higher lie groups is not too developed it
will be probably dicult to make a straightforward generalization of the lattice formulation.
a more promising approach would be to start from the rst-order formalism, the more so
that the wide local symmetry revealed in section 12 can be directly generalized to any lie

2a somewhat similar line was developed in ref. [11] for the 3 + 1 dimensional yangmills theory in the

hamiltonian approach; see also ref. [12].

group. second, it would be interesting to make a transformation similar to that of this paper
in d = 4. the lattice 6j symbols have been known for a while in this case [4] (for the su(2)
colour), however it again seems that the rst-order formalism is a more promising start, due
to the additional gauge symmetry noticed in section 12.

and can be said to be eigenfunctions of a spherical top; they are (2j + 1)2-fold degenerate.
the magnetic quantum numbers m, n have the meaning of the projections of the angular
momentum of a spherical top on the third axes in the body-xed and lab frames. one
can parametrize a 2  2 unitary matrix by euler angles as

u = exp(i 3) exp(i 2) exp(i 3).

(74)

it is convenient to use the unitary matrix u as a formal argument of the d-functions. their

j3

l m ! = (1)j1+j2+j3  j2

etc.

(83)

if one changes the signs of all magnetic quantum numbers or projections, the 3jm symbol
also gets a sign factor:

l m ! = (1)j1+j2+j3  j1

(84)

a practical denition of the 6j symbol {...} is via a contraction over projections in

three 3jm symbols:

(85)

the summation over projections k, l, m is such that p = m  l, q = k  m and r = l  k are
kept xed.
another denition of the 6j symbol is via the full contraction of projections in four 3jm

symbols:

(86)

since the three js of any 3jm symbol satisfy the triangle inequalities, e.g.
|j1  j2| 
j3  j1 + j2, etc., the following four triades of the 6j symbols have to satisfy the triangle
inequalities: (j1j2j3), (j1j5j6), (j2j4j6) and (j3j4j5); otherwise, the 6j symbol is zero.
the 6j symbols are symmetric under permutation of any of two columns and under

interchange of the upper and lower arguments simultaneously in any two columns, e.g.,

( j1

j4

j2
j5

j3

j6 ) = ( j1

j4

j3
j6

j2

j5 ) = ( j4

j1

j2

etc.

(87)

a full contraction of six 3jm symbols yields the 9j symbol:

(88)

9j symbol is symmetric under transposition and under even permutations of rows and
columns; under odd permutations it acquires a sign factor (1)j1+...+j9. as follows from
the denition, six momenta triades corresponding to the rows and columns of the 9j symbol
satisfy triangle inequalities.

a convenient reference book on d-functions, 3jm, 6j and 9j symbols is ref.[1] from where

we have borrowed the denitions.

appendix b. 6j symbols in an even cube

in this appendix we make the decomposition of two plaquettes dj-functions into a sum of
single dj-functions labelled by link angular momenta j. then we assemble the arising 3jm
symbols into 6j symbols attached to the corners of the even cubes. the notations are given
in fig.2.

we nd it convenient (though not necessary) to write the decomposition for the pairs
containing u1,4,12,6,7,10 (these are links sitting at lower left and upper right corners of the
cube) in terms of d(u), and the rest in terms of d(u ).

exploiting eq. (82) of appendix a we get:

we now combine together 3jm symbols related to the same vertices (they are marked by
appropriate indices of the projections a, b, c, d, r, f, g, h), three 3jm symbols for each vertex,
together with appropriate sign factors. the three 3jm symbols per vertex combine into 6j
symbols, one for each vertex of the cube.

[we interchange the rst two columns in the rst 3jm symbol and change the signs of all its

the last two 3jm symbols, and change the summation indices i, j, k  i,j,k]

(1)i+jkhinsert 1 = (1)2jb2ji

in each case we combine the three 3jm symbols and the sign factors so that they suit

the denition of the 6j symbol given in appendix a, eq. (85).
an important property of the sign factors is the following:

if j1, ja, jb enter one 3jm

symbol, there is an equality:

where all signs are possible. this is because out of three momenta either zero or two moments
are half-integer. another important property is that, if j is the momentum entering a certain
3jm symbol, and m is its projection, then (1)2j2m = +1. this is because j and m are
either integer or half-integer, but simultaneously.
below we cite without detailed derivation (which is quite similar to those above) the

expressions for other vertices of the cube.

appendix c. 6j symbols at the lattice sites

in this appendix we show how integration over link variables in eq. (16) combine, together
with the 3jm factors, into 6j symbols composed of the link momenta j, one for each site of
the lattice. the notations are given in fig.3.

let us consider integration over link variables u1,4,12,13,14,15 entering the vertex a shown
in fig.3. this vertex is an intersection of four even cubes denoted in fig.3 as i, ii, iii and
iv . link 1 is common to the cubes i and ii, link 4 is common to i and iv , and so on.

the analytical expression for the cube i is given by eq. (16). the factors relevant to

vertex a are

(99)

it is not necessary to compute anew corresponding expressions for the cubes ii  iv .
it is sucient to draw a correspondence between the links and the sites of other cubes with
those of the cube i. for example, link 1, as seen from the viewpoint of cube ii, is analogous
to link 7 of cube i; the vertex a from the viewpoint of cube ii is analogous to vertex h of
cube i, and vertex b is analogous to vertex g. in the table below we give the list of the
analogs of links in cubes ii  iv to those of the cube i.

the four 3jm symbols in eqs.(99-102) get now fully contracted over all indices. this

results in a 6j symbol according to eq. (86) of appendix a. indeed we have for vertex a:

a = xorqvyz

(1)o+r+zqvy

(109)

[we note that o + r + z = 0; we change the summation variable y  y, and interchange the
last two columns in the second 3jm symbol and the rst two columns in the last two 3jm
symbols  that gives sign factors (1)j1+j13+j14, (1)j12+j14+j15 and (1)j4+j13+j15. finally,
we insert two unities in the form of 1 = (1)2v2j14 and 1 = (1)2q2j15]

[since j12, j14 and j15 came from one 3jm symbol one can use the equation (see eq. (92))
(1)j12j14j15 = (1)j12+j14+j15]

this is the nal result for the vertex a: the six angular momenta ascribed to the six links

entering this vertex combine to produce a 6j symbol.

similarly, one can treat the vertex b, see fig.3. links labelled by numbers 1, 2, 9, 16, 17, 18
enter this vertex; they are pair-wise shared by the cubes i, ii, v and v i. the correspondence
between the links viewed from the viewpoint of the cubes ii, v, v i with those of the cube
i is given by the following table:

performing the same steps as in deriving the 6j symbol for the vertex a we arrive to the

following result for the vertex b:

b = (1)j1+j2+j9+j16+j17j18( j1

j17

j9
j18

j16 ) .

(112)

we notice that vertex a is of the even and vertex b is of the odd type: all other vertices
of the lattice can be considered as either even or odd. therefore, eqs. (111, 112) give
actually the full result. combining them together we nd that a sign factor

should be attributed to all links of the lattice.

let us prove that this sign factor is equivalent (in the vacuum!) to a sign factor

(1)2j = (1)2j

(1)2j = (1)2j

(113)

(114)

attributed to all plaquettes of the lattice. we recall that all links are shared by two even
cubes whose faces carry plaquette values j. we rst attribute all links to only one (out of
the two possible) cubes, according to some rule. many such rules can be suggested, the only
requirement being that each link is attributed to one and only one even cube. an example
is given by the following construction: we choose the edges 12,5,9,2 and 7 (see fig.2) as
belonging to the cube shown on that gure. the rest six edges will then belong to one of
the neighbouring even cubes. for example, the edge 1 will be counted as belonging to the
cube ii (see fig.3). indeed, from the cube ii point of view that edge will be of the type 7,
and so forth. it can be seen that, in these scheme, every link of the full lattice will belong
to one and only one even cube.

we have, therefore, a sign factor

(1)2j12+2j5+2j9+2j2+2j7

(115)

attributed to the cube i. next, we recall that, e.g., j12 enters the 3jm symbol together with
the plaquette angular momenta jb and je (see (90)). using eq. (92) appropriate to the case
we can replace (1)2j12 = (1)2jb +2je . similarly, (1)2j5 = (1)2jb+2jf , and so on. as a
result we get that the sign factor (115) is equal to

(1)2ja+2jb+2jc +2jd+2je+2jf .

(116)

this procedure can be repeated for all even cubes of the lattice. it proves the above statement
that the product of all link sign factors (113) can be replaced by the product of all plaquette
sign factors (114). it should be stressed that this proof is valid only for the vacuum, i.e. for
the partition function itself but, generally speaking, not for the averages of operators.

appendix d. 9j symbols from the wilson loop

let the wilson loop in the representation js go through the links ...,15,1,17,..., see fig.3 for
notations. it means that one has now to integrate three d-functions of the link variables
u15,1,..., instead of two, as it was in eqs. (103, 108) of the previous appendix, the rest
integrations remaining unchanged. we have now

using the other 3jm symbols related to the vertex a (see eqs.(99-102)) and the kronecker

symbols from eqs.(104-107) we get for the vertex a:

a = x(1)r+z+w+pm  j1

[we notice that r + z = o, w + p = u and that o + u + m = 0, hence the sign factor is +1;
we change the signs of all projections in the second 3jm symbol, and permute the columns
in other 3jm symbols to match the denition of the 9j symbols as given by eq. (88)]

to get the nal sign factor we have used the relation (1)2j12j22j3 = +1 valid for any
j1,2,3 originating from one 3jm symbol.
