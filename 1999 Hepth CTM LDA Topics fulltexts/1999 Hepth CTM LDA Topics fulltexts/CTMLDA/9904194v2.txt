abstract

in angular quantization approach a perturbation theory for the massive thirring

model (mtm) is developed, which allows us to calculate vacuum expectation values

of exponential elds in sin-gordon theory near the free fermion point in rst order of

mtm coupling constant g. the hankel-transforms play an important role when carrying

out this calculations. the expression we have found coincides with that of the direct

expansion over g of the exact formula conjectured by s.lukyanov and a.zamolodchikov.

1 introduction

sin-gordon theory is one of the most studied examples of exactly integrable relativistic

qft in two dimensions. its action

ssg =z d2x(cid:26) 1

16

 + 2 cos (cid:27)

(1.1)

may be viewed as a perturbation of the free massless bose eld by the relevant operator

cos  with scaling dimension d = 22 < 2. it is convenient to normalize exponential

elds by the condition, that in uv limit their two point functions approach to those of

c = 1 conformal free bose eld theory

deia(x)eia(y)esg  |x  y|4a2

as |x  y|  0.

(1.2)

the on-shell properties of this theory i.e. the mass spectrum and the s-matrix are well

known [1]. the lightest particles of the theory are solitons and antisolitons in term of

which sin-gordon theory has an equivalent lagrangian formulation with the action of

massive thirring model (mtm) [2]

where ,  are two component dirac spinors and the corresponding (anti-) particles are

identied with the (anti-) solitons of ( 1.1). the famous coleman relations

(1.4)

serve as a dictionary between bosonic and fermionic languages. more recently comparing

the results of the thermodynamic bethe-ansatz analyses with those of the conformal

perturbation theory an exact relation between the soliton mass m and the perturbation

parameter  is established [3]

starting from the expressions for the special cases   0 (semiclassical limit) and
2 = 1/2 (free fermion case) s.lukyanov and a.zamolodchikov in [4] the following general
formula for the vacuum expectation value (vev) ga = hexp ia (0)i have conjectured

.

in the subsequent papers [5], [6] some convincing arguments have been presented, showing

that the vevs ega = hexp a (0)ishg in sinh-gordon theory, the action of which formally
can be obtained simply replacing   ib in (1.1), obey the functional relations

ega = r (a) egqa = ega,

(1.8)

where q = b + 1/b and r (a) is related to the liouville reection amplitude s (p) [7]

 (1  b2)! 2ip

b  (1 + 2ip/b)  (1 + 2ipb)
 (1  2ip/b)  (1  2ipb)

.

(1.9)

it is natural to expect that ega can be obtained from ga making the analytic continuation

  ib; a  ia.

(1.10)

and indeed it can be shown that after substitution (1.10), the expression (1.7) obeys

the relation (1.8). unfortunately the functional relations (1.8) alone are not sucient

to nd ega uniquely: the multiplication by any even, periodic with period q function
of a gives a dierent solution to (1.8). however, ega obtained from (1.7) is the only

meromorphic solution, obeying the extra requirement of minimality (i.e. the condition

that only the poles and zeros, imposed by the functional relations (1.8) are allowed).

so, any independent test of the lukyanov-zamolodchikov formula (1.7) will support the

minimality assumption as well. this is important also because there are other interesting

models for which some functional relations like (1.8) are hold and the minimality condition

makes it possible to nd exact vevs.

2

in this article a perturbation theory based on the angular quantization [8] of the

mtm (1.3) is developed, using which lukyanov-zamolodchikov formula (1.7) near the

free fermion point in rst order over the mtm coupling constant g is tested.

the section 2 is devoted to the angular quantization of the mtm (1.3). a particular

attention is payed to the local eld product regularization procedure, which has some

additional features in comparison with the case of the ordinary quantization in cartesian

coordinates.

in section 3 we calculate vev hexp ia (0)i near the free fermion point. it appears
that the hankel-transform is a very useful tool to carry out this calculation. some of the

related mathematical details are presented in appendix a. the choices we have made

to regularize the traces over the fermionic fock space and the local eld product, result

in a nite multiplicative renormalization of the eld exp ia (0). the corresponding

renormalization factor is calculated using the methods of boundary cft [9] in appendix
b. the nal expression we obtained for the expansion of the vev hexp ia (0)i up to
the rst order in mtm coupling constant g is in complete agreement with the lukyanov-

zamolodchikov conjecture (1.7).

2 angular quantization of the massive thirring model

it is convenient to use the ciral representation of the dirac matrices

0 = 2 =

0 i

and denote the components of dirac spinors as

 , 1 = i1 =
 ,   0.

(2.1)

(2.2)

in this notations the action (1.3) in euclidean space reads

am t m = z d2z 2(cid:20)rr + ll 

im

2 (cid:16)lr  rl(cid:17)

(2.3)

where z =  + ix1, z =   ix1 are complex coordinates on the plane ( = ix0 is the
euclidean time ),   /z,   /z and the measure d2z  dx1d .
as the vevs of local elds deia(0)e have rotational symmetry, it is natural to use

the conformal polar coordinates ,  dened by

z  e+i;

z  ei

(2.4)

and treat ,  as space and (euclidean) time respectively. under the coordinate trans-

formation (2.4) the fermi elds transform as follows:

l (z, z) = e i

4  +i

2 l (, ) ; r (z, z) = e

i

4  i

2 r (, ) ,

(2.5)

and similarly for the conjugate elds l, r. in this coordinates the action (2.3) takes
the form:

am t m =

2z0

d

z
d hl (  i) l + r ( + i) r
ime(cid:16)lr  rl(cid:17) + 2gllrri .

(2.6)

the usual canonical quantization yields the following equal time anti-commutation

relations:

nl () , l ()o =  (  ) ,

nr () , r ()o =  (  ) .

(2.7)

from (2.6) one deduces that the hamiltonian dening the evolution along  is given by

k =

z

dhlil + rir  ime(cid:16)lr  rl(cid:17) +

2gllrri .

(2.8)

to regularize the theory, following [4] let us restrict the range of the space coordinate 
to the semi-innite box   [log ;) with m  1 and impose the boundary conditions
(2.9)

l + l |=log = r + r |=log = 0.

as usual, to develope perturbation theory in interaction picture, one rst has to diag-

onalize the quadratic part of the hamiltonian (2.8). this can be achieved using the

decomposition [4]

l (, ) = xn
r (, ) = xn
l (, ) = xn
r (, ) = xn

in terms of this operators the free part of the hamiltonian (2.8) takes a very simple form

k0 = xn +

(2.17)

is taken in interaction picture and t indicates the time ordering operation. in (2.21) we
introduced the notation n (  ) for the suitably regularized product of the local operators
in coinciding points (see below). appearance of trace instead of conventional vacuum

matrix element in (2.20) is due to compactication of the time .

now let us turn to the regularization procedure of the products of local operators at

the coinciding points. in the ordinary case of non-compactied time one simply implies

normal ordering prescription which is well known to be equivalent to the suppression

of all contractions among the elds inside normal ordering symbol. in contrary to the

vacuum matrix element, the trace of normal ordered product of creation and annihilation

operators doesnt vanish, therefore the analogues regularization in the case of compacti-

ed time is slightly changed. it is easy to see that in this case the correctly regularized

perturbing operator n(cid:16)llrr(cid:17) is given by

n(cid:16)llrr(cid:17) = llrr dlle0

(2.24)

note that, while to give a proper mining to the rst expression for the perturbing operator

n(cid:16)llrr(cid:17) (see (2.22) ) one has to apply point splitting, the separate terms of the

second expression are already nite.

nential elds exp ia (0)

where  denotes the analytic continuation around the point 0. the vev hexp ia (0)i
can be expressed in terms of grassmanian functional integral [4]

i (a) = rfahddi eam t m

,

(3.2)

where the functional integration in the numerator is carried out over the space fa of
twisted eld congurations with monodromy (3.1). in angular quantization picture the

insertion of the operator exp ia (0) changes the boundary conditions along time di-

rection so that the hilbert space remains untouched but the hamiltonian due to (3.1)
acquires an additional term iaq/, where
q = xn +

(cid:17)

(3.21)

now let us turn to the computation of the renormalization factor z in ( 3.5). if  is small

enough we can split the region |z|   into two pieces by the circle |z| = e with some e

satisfying the conditions

log e
  1;

log me  1

11

(3.22)

so that inside the rst region u1 = {z;   |z|  e} the theory is nearly conformal invari-
ant and at the same time in the region u2 = {z;|z| > e} the inuence of the boundary
at |z| =  could be neglected. note that in contrary to the region u2 where the regular-
ization prescription ( 2.22) is standard and in cartesian coordinates transforms to the

usual normal ordering , due to the inuence of the boundary in region u1 the interaction

term of the hamiltonian (2.21) results in an extra multiplicative renormalization of the
eld exp ia (besides the usual charge renormalization ar = (1  g/2) a ). the actual
computation of the renormalization constant z is signicantly simplied owing to the ex-

istence of conformal invariance inside the region u1. as usual in cft it is convenient to
use radial quantization [10]. let us denote by |b, ai the boundary state [9] corresponding
to the boundary conditions (2.9) and belonging to the conformal family [10] of the state

|ai = exp ia (0)|0i. note that during the evaluation from  to e, the state 2a2 |b, ai
approaches to e2a2 |ai thus correctly imitating the insertion of the eld exp ia (0). this

consideration makes transparent the appearance of the factor 2a2 in (3.5). it is not

dicult to see that the renormalization factor z is given by

z  1 = 4g ez

.

(3.23)

here and in what follows we take the fermi elds in initial coordinates z , z (i.e. the

transformation (2.5) is not applied). the operator l0+l0 (l0, l0 are the virasoro genera-
tors) is included in (3.23) to take into account that the boundary state |b, ai is associated
to the circle |z| = . the second term in (3.23) subtracts the contribution of the charge
renormalization. in appendix b we have presented the details of the computation of the

matrix element included in (3.23). inserting (b.6) into (3.23) and performing integration

with the help of (a.25) we obtain

appendix a

it appears that the hankel-transforms are appropriate tools allowing us to perform

the integration over x in (3.10).

in polar coordinates the hankel-transforms play the

same role, as the ordinary fourier-transforms in the cartesian one.

let me briey recall the main formulae concerning to the hankel-transforms (for
details see [11] and references therein). the -th order (  > 1 ) direct and inverse
hankel-transforms of the function f (x) dened on (0,) are given by

z0
j (sx)ff (s) sds,
z0

j (sx) f (x) xdx,

(a.1)

(a.2)

f (x) =

ff (s) =

where j is the bessel function. in complete analogy with the case of fourier-transform,

it follows from (a.1), (a.2), that the scalar product of any two functions1 f (x), g(x) in
1 since the functions we are dealing with are regular in the interval (0,), the only thing one has to

care of is the convergence of integrals at the extreme points 0 and .

13

x representation coincides with the scalar product of their images in s representation:

z0

f (x) g (x) xdx =

z0 ff (s)fg (s) sds.

the starting point of our consideration is the formula [11]

(a.3)

[k (x)]2 sin () = 

z0

j0 (2x sinh t) sinh (2t) dt,

(a.4)

|re| <

; x > 0,

which obviously can be considered (after substitution s = sinh t) as the 0 -th order
hankel-transform of the function [k (x)]2. assuming 0 < re1 < 1/2, 0 < re2 < 1/2

and using ( a.3) one obtains

sin (1) sin (2)

where the second equality follows from (a.25). for our purposes we have to restrict the
range of integration in (a.5) to [m,) and substitute 1  1/2 + i1, 1  1/2 + i2.
this has to be done carefully, since for such values of parameters the integral (a.5)
doesnt converge at x  0. to avoid this diculty, one rst has to subtract the integral

sin (1) sin (2)

(a.6)

from (a.5) and only after it to make above mentioned substitutions 1  1/2 + i1,
2  1/2 + i2 . note that in (a.6) we have used the following expansion of k 2
 (x) near
0:

k 2

 (x) =

 ()

4 sin ()(cid:18) 2

x(cid:19)2(cid:16)1 + o(cid:16)x2(cid:17)(cid:17) .

(a.7)

as a result one easily arrives at (3.13).

the proof of (3.12) we begin with the formula

sin ()



k (x) k1 (x) =

2x 

z0

[j1 (2x sinh t) cosh ((2  1) t)] dt,

(a.8)

which can be veried dierentiating (a.4) over x and using the identities



k

 (x) = k1 (x) 
0 (x) = j1 (x) .
j




x

k (x) ,

(a.9)

since the image of the function 1/x under the rst order hankel-transform is equal to 1,
the equation (a.8) (after substitution   1/2 + i) can be rewritten as

cosh ()



(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k 1

+i1

(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

=

j1 (2x sinh t) (cos 2t  cosh t) dt.

(a.10)

unfortunately (a.10) can not be used directly to calculate integral (3.12) because of the

singularity at x = 0:

cosh ()



|k (x)|2 =

to overcome this diculty we replace the functions

cosh ()



with their regularized versions

and (a.10). then one rst applies (a.3) to calculate the regularized version of the integral
(3.12) over the full interval (0,) , next subtracts the integral over the interval (0, m)
(as m  1, one simply applies the asymptotic formula (a.11) ) and, afterwards gets

rid of the cut-o  tending it to . the nal result is the equation (3.12). note that
using (a.25), integration over t on the right hand side of (3.12) may be expressed via the

(a.15)

now let us sketch the proof of the equation (3.18). consider the function l (a, b) (a,

b are real variables and |a| < ) dened by the integral

and the contour integral

l (a, b) =

z0

eibx log(cid:16)1 + ex+ia(cid:17) dx

j (c ; b) =zc

eibz log(cid:16)1 + ez(cid:17) dz

for any contour c on the complex z-plain. let c1,a, c2,a be the contours

c1,a :

c2,a :

z = i + it;
z = ia + t;

0 < t    a,
t > 0 .

(a.16)

(a.17)

(a.18)

as the integration contour can be freely deformed inside analyticity domain it is clear

that

j (c1,a; b) + j (c2,a; b) = j (c2,; b) = j (c1,; b) + j (c2,; b) .

(a.19)

taking into account the evident relations

j (c2,a, b) = eabl (a, b) ,

l (, b) = l (, b)

16

(a.20)

we obtain

thus

j (c1,a; b) + eabl (a, b) =

eb

eb  eb j (c1,; b) .

eab (l (a, b) + l (a,b)) = j (c1,a; b)  j (c1,a;b) +

eb

eb

2 sinh b

j (c1,; b) 

2 sinh b

j (c1,;b) .

but an easy exercise shows that the r.h.s. of (a.22) is equal to

eb

2 sinh b

z

xebxdx +

za

xebxdx = eab  1  ab
b2 

eab

b sinh b! .

so we have obtained

re

eibx log(cid:16)1 + ex+ia(cid:17) dx =

1  ab
2b2 

eab

2b sinh b

.

(a.21)

(a.22)

(a.23)

(a.24)

dierentiating the equation (a.24) over a and changing the notations in an obvious way

we explicitly arrive at (3.18).

by part may be reduced to (a.26).
