particles could ever directly observed. however extensive literature investigating phenomenological implications string theory contact may yet made experiment (for recent review see ). string theory also quantum theory gravity. fact, consistent quantum theory date contains gravity dynamical sense. (in two three dimensions, theories quantum gravity formulated, non-dynamical sense gravitons propagate). another avenue, then, connecting string theory physical world via quantum gravitational eects. example one might consider hawking radiation black holes. essentially quantum mechanical eect: whereas black holes classically cannot radiate (due causal structure geometry), quantum mechanically radiate blackbodies. many years fundamental, microscopic description eect almost much mystery string theory general relativity. however, recent advances description string-theoretic solitons enabled string theorists give account hawking radiation certain limited class black holes. worth emphasizing still far experiment, particularly since black holes amenable treatment string theory general carry large electric charge. astrophysically, charge would quickly neutralized infalling matter. recent developments understanding dualities string theory (for review see {$9607201$}) much heart progress string-theoretic description black holes. particularly prominent role played so-called d-branes {$9510017$}, objects derived via detailed understanding t-duality open closed string theories. closed string theories require strings cannot ends, whereas open strings denition ends. however, full con- sistency closed string theories duality symmetries requires existence d-branes, thought special surfaces strings allowed end. mathematical characterization suggests: dynamical objects themselves, denite tension weak coupling large compared tension fundamental strings. large tension d-branes suggests may suitable objects build black holes. development idea implications description dynamical eects like hawking radiation two main themes thesis. link extremal near-extremal black holes world-volume theories describing 4 excitations branes explored now-voluminous literature. various aspects general program understanding link initiated  (entropy eective string models),  (hawking radiation processes),  (absorption extremal three-branes). tangentially related subject, probing sub-string-scale geometries using d-branes, grew initial work {$9608024$} vast subject matrix theory {$9610043$}. excitations d-branes low energies described supersymmetric gauge theories {$9607201$}. observation opens yet another avenue connecting string theory mainstream physics: one hand d-branes describe black holes, hand characterized low energies gauge theory, perhaps information gauge theory encoded supergravity solutions corresponding black holes. realization concrete ways developing correspondence present one main sources excitement string theory community. even hints supersymmetry may longer essential ingredient gravity gauge theory correspondence. earlier work extracting gauge theory physics intersecting brane congurations {$9510017$} relies little supergravity, yielded remarkable insights geometric character supersymmetric gauge theory (for review see {$9601029$}). past months, appearance papers , entire un- derstanding link string theory d-branes supergravity gauge theory evolved rapidly. essential ingredients new approach following two insights: 1) information infrared behavior gauge theories encoded near-horizon geome- try black branes supergravity; 2) perturbations gauge theory implemented constraints supergravity elds hypersurface surrounds brane distance close near-horizon geometry merges asymptotically space. second insight, achieved various forms , termed holography witten. although term (originally proposed hooft susskind applicable black holes) used somewhat murky fashion string theory literature, current application appropriate following sense. dynamics gauge theory mirrored supergravity theory subjected boundary conditions hypersurface, one lower dimension ambient space (but dimension world-volume gauge theory). thus one views gauge theory hologram supergravity. last two chapters thesis devoted pre-holography era black holes string theory. chapter 2 presents brief investigation entropy black holes built d- branes. focus two examples intensively studied literature: d3-branes ten-dimensional spacetime, three-charge black holes regular horizon ve- dimensional spacetime. remarkable insight d-brane approach yields entropy certain black holes explained terms statistical mechanics world-volume theory d-branes. remainder thesis split two parts. rst part, chapters 3-5, based papers . focus string theory description hawking radiation particle absorption near-extremal black holes four dimensions. string theory model black holes eective string whose excitations described conformal eld theory (cft). inuential paper {$9601029$} includes computation central charge conformal eld theory via moduli space argument. chapter 2 develop concise limited version argument using index theorems. eective string realized d3-brane two spatial dimensions wrapped around four-dimensional manifold. familiar description, developed initially {$9602043$}, view eective string number d1-branes embedded d5-branes (whose four extra dimensions wrapped around four-dimensional manifold). black hole dimensions obtained wrapping eective string around circle. black holes four dimensions also treated via eective strings constructed within string theory , arise naturally intersecting ve-branes m-theory . extensive recent literature comparing black hole entropy microscopic state counts, 5 black holes admit eective string description always proven reliably tractable. agreements bekenstein-hawking entropy statistical mechanical entropy longer considered miraculous case supersymmetric black holes, two calculations dierent ways counting states preserve supersymmetry. so-called bps states generally protected mass renormalizations short multiplet structure super- symmetry algebra. surprising successful comparisons near-extremal black hole entropy statistical mechanical analyses, cases supersymmetry prevent mi- crostates changing masses one proceeds region weak coupling statistical mechanical analysis performed region strong coupling supergravity applicable. chapter 2 see agreements indeed rather exception rule. however, comparisons entropy near-extremal eective string black holes succeeded certain limits {$9602043$}. turns out, central charge alone determines eective string models entropy relevant limits, usually termed dilute gas regime.1 thus status central charge non-renormalized quantity (namely measure density bps states) basically guarantees success entropy comparisons dilute gas regime. original realization {$9601029$} eective string cft supersymmetric non-linear sigma model whose target space symmetric power four dimensional manifold. straightforward extract central charge proceed entropy calculations, proven dicult determine primary elds couple elds supergravity. precisely questions explored via calculations absorption hawking emission black holes. semi-classical supergravity description black holes, hawking radiation particle ab- sorption radically dierent phenomena: absorption classical eect, hawking radiation strictly quantum mechanical. precise, hawkings formula (see example {$9606185$}) relating emission rate massless particles element wave-number phase space d3k absorption cross-section temperature given terms surface gravity horizon: ee/kb 1 d3k (2)3 = hc = h c 2kb .
