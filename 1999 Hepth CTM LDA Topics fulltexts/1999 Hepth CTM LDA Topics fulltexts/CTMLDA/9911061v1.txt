abstract

recent progress in understanding (2+1)-dimensional yang-mills (y m2+1) theory via the
use of gauge-invariant variables is reviewed. among other things, we discuss the vacuum
wavefunction, an analytic calculation of the string tension and the propagator mass for
gluons and its relation to the magnetic mass for y m3+1 at nonzero temperature. (talk
given at the workshop on physical variables in gauge theories, dubna, russia, september
1999.)

1. introduction

in this talk i shall discuss a hamiltonian approach to yang-mills theory in two spatial
dimensions (y m2+1), where nonperturbative calculations can be carried out to the extent
that results on mass gap and string tension can be compared with lattice simulations of the
theory. the work i shall report on was developed over the last few years in collaboration
with d. karabali and chanju kim [1, 2, 3]. (eventhough i shall concentrate on the pure
y m2+1, some of the results can be extended to the yang-mills-chern-simons theory [4]).
physical variables or gauge-invariant variables play a key role in our analysis, in keeping
with the theme of this conference, and i hope this will be a nice example of how such
variables can elucidate the nonperturbative structure of gauge theories.

before entering into the details of our work, let me say a few words about the relevance of
y m2+1. gauge theories (without matter) in (1+1) dimensions are rather trivial since there
are no propagating degrees of freedom, although there may be global degrees of freedom
on spaces of nontrivial topology. in (2+1) dimensions, gauge theories do have propagating
degrees of freedom and being next in the order of complexity, it is possible that they provide
a model simple enough to analyze mathematically and yet nontrivial enough to teach us
some lessons about (3+1)-dimensional y m theories. another very important reason to
study y m2+1 is its relevance to magnetic screening in y m3+1 at high temperature. gauge
theories at nite temperature have worse infrared problems than at zero temperature due
to the divergent nature of the bose distribution for low energy modes. a dynamically
generated debye-type screening mass will eliminate some of these, but we need a magnetic
screening mass as well to have a perturbative expansion which is well dened in the infrared.
a simple way to see that a magnetic mass can be dynamically generated is as follows. in
the imaginary time formalism, with matsubara frequencies n = 2nt , where t is the tem-

perature, the gauge elds have a mode expansion as ai(~x, x0) = pn ai,n(~x) exp(i2nt x0).

at high temperatures and for modes of wavelength long compared to 1/t , the modes
with nonzero matsubara frequencies are unimportant and the theory reduces to the the-
ory of the n = 0 mode, viz., a three (euclidean) dimensional yang-mills theory (or a
(2+1)-dimensional theory in a wick rotated version). yang-mills theories in three or (2+1)
dimensions are expected to have a mass gap and this is eectively the magnetic mass of
the (3+1)-dimensional theory at high temperature [5]. in order to incorporate this feature
into y m3+1 at nonzero temperatures, one needs a decomposition of the y m3+1 feynman
integrals wherein the y m2+1 pieces are isolated; in other words, one needs to identify the
slots in the perturbative expansion of y m3+1 where the y m2+1 results can be inserted.
there is a recent analysis along these lines by reinbach and schulz [6].

let me now start by recalling a couple of facts about y m2+1. the coupling constant
e2 has the dimension of mass and it does not run as the four-dimensional coupling does.

2

the dimensionless expansion parameter of the theory is k/e2 or e2/k, where k is a typical
momentum. thus modes of low momenta must be treated nonperturbatively, while modes
of high momenta can be treated perturbatively. there is no simple dimensionless expansion
parameter. y m2+1 is perturbatively super-renormalizable, so the ultraviolet singularities
are well under control.

2. t he parametrization of the f ields

coming now to the details of our analysis, let us consider a gauge theory with group
g = su (n ) in the a0 = 0 gauge. the gauge potential can be written as ai = itaaa
i ,
i = 1, 2, where ta are hermitian n  n -matrices which form a basis of the lie algebra
of su (n ) with [ta, tb] = if abctc, tr(tatb) = 1
2 ab. the spatial coordinates x1, x2 will be
combined into the complex combinations z = x1  ix2, z = x1 + ix2 with the corresponding
a  az = 1
components for the potential a  az = 1
2 (a1  ia2) = (az).
the starting point of our analysis is a change of variables given by
az = m 1zm 

2 (a1 + ia2),

(1)

az = zm m 1,

here m, m  are complex matrices in general, not unitary. if they are unitary, the potenial
is a pure gauge. the parametrization (1) is possible and is standard in many discussions of
two-dimensional gauge elds. (there are also has similarities between (1) and the construc-
tion of gauge-invariant particle states as discussed by mcmullan, lavelle and horan at this
workshop [7].) a particular advantage of this parametrization is the way gauge transforma-
tions are realized. a gauge transformation ai  a(g)
i = g1aig + g1ig, g(x)  su (n ) is
obtained by the transformation m  m (g) = gm . the gauge-invariant degrees of freedom
are parametrized by the hermitian matrix h = m m . physical state wavefunctions are
functions of h.

in making a change of variables in a hamiltonian formalism, there are two things we
must do: 1) evaluate the volume measure (or jacobian of the transformation) which deter-
mines the inner product of the wavefunctions and 2) rewrite the hamiltonian as an operator
involving the new variables. a consistency check would then be the self-adjointness of the
hamiltonian with the given inner product. we begin with the volume measure for the
conguration space.

3. t he f unctional measure and inner product

is ds2
which is the standard euclidean volume. from (1) we see that

i , with the corresponding volume d(a) = qx,a daa(x)d aa(x),

a = r d2x aa

i aa

a = d(m m 1) = (cid:16)(m m 1) + [a, m m 1](cid:17)

 a = d(m 1m )

which gives

d(a) = (det d d) d(m, m )

where d(m, m ) is the volume for the complex matrices m, m , which is associated with
the metric ds2

form dv as d(m, m ) = qx dv (m, m ) where

m = 8r tr(m m 1 m 1m ). this is given by the highest order dierential
dv (m, m ) 

a1...an(dm m 1)a1  ...  (dm m 1)an
 b1...bn(m 1dm )b1  ...  (m 1dm )bn

where n = dimg = dimsu (n ) = n 21. (there are some constant numerical factors which
are irrelevant for our discussion.) the complex matrix m can be written as m = u , where
u is unitary and  is hermitian. this is the matrix analogue of the modulus and phase
decomposition for a complex number. since gauge transformations act as m  m (g) = gm ,
we see that u represents the gauge degrees of freedom and  represents the gauge-invariant
degrees of freedom on m . substituting m = u , (5) becomes

dv (m, m ) 



a1...an(d1 + 1d)a1  ...  (d1 + 1d)an
 b1...bn(u 1du )b1  ...  (u 1du )bn
a1...an(h 1dh)a1  ...  (h 1dh)and(u )

(6)

here d(u ) is the standard group volume measure (the haar measure) for su (n ). upon
taking the product over all points, d(u ) gives the volume of the entire gauge group (namely
all su (n )-valued functions) which we denote by vol(g) and thus

the volume element or the integration measure for the gauge-invariant congurations can

d(m, m )

vol(g)

= (det d d)d(h)

(9)

where we have used (7). the problem is thus reduced to the calculation of the determinant
of the two-dimensional operator d d. this is well known [8]. the simplest way to evaluate
this is to dene  = log det d d, which gives



 aa = i trh d1(x, y)t aiyx

(t a)mn = if a
mn are the generators of the lie algebra in the adjoint representation. the
coincident-point limit of d1(x, y) is singular and needs regularization. with a gauge-
invariant regulator,one nds

trh(a  m 1m )tai

(11)

it is equal to n for su (n ). using this result in (10) and

where caab = f amnf bmn;
integrating we get

s(h) is the wess-zumino-witten (wzw) action for the hermitian matrix eld h given by
[9]

(det d d) = " det

r d2x #dimg

s(h) =

2 z tr(h h 1) +

we can now write the inner product for states |1i and |2i, represented by the wavefunc-

tions 1 and 2, as [10]

h1|2i = z d(h)e2ca s(h) 

12

(14)

4. t ransf orming the hamiltonian

the next step is the change of variables in the hamiltonian. however, there is some
further simplication we can do before taking up the hamiltonian. we would expect the
wavefunctions to be functionals of the matrix eld h, but actually we can take them to be
functionals of the current of the wzw model (13) given by j = (ca/)zh h 1. first of
all we notice that the wilson loop operator can be constructed from j alone as

w (c) = trp ehc (adz+ adz) = trp e(/ca)hc j

(15)

5

since the wilson loop operator can provide a complete description of gauge-invariant ob-
servables, it is sucient to take wavefunctions to be functions of j. there is also a conformal
theory argument to show that it is sucient to conside only functions of j [1, 2].

this means that we can transform the hamiltonian h = t + v to express it in terms
of j and functional derivatives with respect to j. this is achieved by the chain rule of
dierentiation

regularization is important in calculating the coecients of the two terms in t . carrying

(17)

(18)

(19)

the rst term in t shows that every power of j in the wavefunction gives a value m to
the energy, suggesting the existence of a mass gap. the calculation of this term involves
exactly the same quantity as in (10) and with the same regulator leads to (17), i.e.,

(20)

finally, (17,18) (with regularizations taken account of) give a self-adjoint hamiltonian

which, as i mentioned before, is a nice consistency check.

5. an intuitive argument

the next step is to solve the schrodinger equation, at least for the vacuum state and
the low lying excited states. however, before taking this up, i shall give a short intuitive
argument for the existence of a mass gap.

6

first of all notice that the total volume of the conguration space as given by (9) is

nite, modulo regularization of the laplacian  , and can be written as [10, 1]

z [dazdaz]
vol(g)

= " (det )

r d2x #dimg

(21)

in contrast to this, the corresponding result for an abelian theory (which has ca = 0)
(if we make a mode decomposition of h or a over the eigenmodes of the
is innite.
laplacian  , the integration over the amplitude of each mode is nite for the nonabelian
case because of the exponential; the divergence arises from the innity of modes and can be
regularized by truncation to a nite number of modes. for the abelian case, the integration
for each mode is divergent.) this result is encouraging as regards the question of the mass
gap. one can go further and make a slightly better argument. the crucial ingredient is
the measure of integration in the inner product (14). writing e, b for the root mean
square uctuations of the electric eld e and the magnetic eld b, we have, from the
canonical commutation rules [ea
j] = iijab, e b  k, where k is the momentum
variable. this gives an estimate for the energy

i , ab

e2 !

e =

(22)

min  e2k, giving e  k. this
for low lying states, we minimize e with respect to b2, b2
corresponds to the standard photon. for the nonabelian theory, this is inadequate since
hhi involves the factor e2cas(h). in fact,

hhi  z d(h)e2cas(h) 1

2 (e2e2 + b2/e2)

(23)

in terms of b, the wzw action goes like s(h)  [(ca/) 1
2 r b(1/k2)b + ...]; we thus see
that b follows a gaussian distribution of width b2  k2/ca, for small values of k. this
gaussian dominates near small k giving b2  k2(/ca). in other words, eventhough e
is minimized around b2  k, probability is concentrated around b2  k2(/ca). for
the expectation value of the energy, we then nd e  e2ca/2 + o(k2). thus the kinetic
term in combination with the measure factor e2cas(h) could lead to a mass gap of order
e2ca. the argument is not rigorous, but captures the essential physics as we shall see in a
moment.

6. t he vacuum wavef unction

let us now consider the eigenstates of the theory. the vacuum wavefunction is pre-
sumably the simplest to calculate. ignoring the potential term v for the moment, since

7

t involves derivatives, we see immediately that the ground state wavefunction for t is
0 = 1. this may seem like a trivial statement, but the key point is that it is normalizable
with the inner product (14); in fact, the normalization integral is (21). starting with this,
we can solve the schroodinger equation taking 0 to be of the form exp(p ), where p is a
perturbative series in the potential term v (equivalent to a 1/m-expansion). we then get

p =

trz : j j :



m2ca


(cid:18)

m2ca(cid:19)2

[d 2j, j] 2j

[d j, j] 2j +
2
[j, j][j, 3j] :] + o(
9

1
m8 )

(24)

where dh = (ca/)h  [j, h]. the series is naturally grouped as terms with 2 js, terms
with 3 js, etc. these terms can be summed up; for the 2j-terms we nd

0 = exp


1

2e2 zx,y

ba(x)"

1

(m + m2  2)#x,y

ba(y) + o(3j)


the rst term in (25) has the correct (perturbative) high momentum limit, viz.,

0  exp"

1

2e2 zx,y

ba(x)(cid:20)

1

2(cid:21)x,y

ba(y) + o(3j)#

(25)

(26)

thus although we started with the high m (or low momentum) limit, the result (25) does
match onto the perturbative limit. the higher terms are also small for the low momentum
limit.

we can now use this result to calculate the expectation value of the wilson loop operator;

for the fundamental representation, it is given by

hwf (c)i


= constant exp [ac]
= e2s n 2  1

8

(27)

where ac is the area of the loop c.  is the string tension. this is a prediction of
our analysis starting from rst principles with no adjustable parameters. notice that the
dependence on e2 and n is in agreement with large-n expectations, with  depending

8

only on the combination e2n as n  .
(the rst correction to the large-n limit
is negative, viz., (e2n )/2n 28 which may be interesting in the context of large-n
analyses.) formula (27) gives the values /e2 = 0.345, 0.564, 0.772, 0.977 for n = 2, 3, 4, 5.
there are estimates for  based on monte carlo simulations of lattice gauge theory. the
most recent results for the gauge groups su (2), su (3), su (4) and su (5) are /e2 =
0.335, 0.553, 0.758, 0.966 [11]. we see that our result agrees with the lattice result to within
 3%.
one might wonder at this stage why the result is so good when we have not included
the 3j- and higher terms in the the wavefunction. this is basically because the string
tension is determined by large area loops and for these, it is the long distance part of the
wavefunction which contributes signicantly. in this limit, the 3j- and higher terms in (25)
are small compared to the quadratic term.

we have summed up the 3j-terms as well. generally, one nds that p , when expressed
in terms of the magnetic eld, is nonlocal even in a (1/m)-expansion, contrary to what one
might expect for a theory with a mass. this is essentially due to gauge invariance combined
with our choice of a0 = 0; it has recently been shown that a similar result holds for the
schwinger model [12].

7. m agnetic mass

i shall now briey return to the magnetic mass. from the expression (17) we see
immediately that for a wavefunction which is just j a, we have the exact result t j a = m j a.
when the potential term is added, j a is no longer an exact eigenstate; we nd

showing how the mass value is corrected to the relativistic dispersion relation.

(t + v ) j a = pm2  2 j a + 

(28)

now j a may be considered as the gauge-invariant denition of the gluon. this result
thus suggests a dynamical propagator mass m = e2ca/2 for the gluon. a dierent way
to see this result is as follows. we can expand the matrix eld j in powers of a which
parametrizes h, so that j  (ca/)ata. this is like a perturbation expansion, but a
resummed or improved version of it, where we expand the wzw action in exp(2cas(h))
but not expand the exponential itself. the hamiltonian can then be simplied as

2zx
h  1

[

2
2
a(x)

+ a(x)(m2  2)a(x)] + ...

(29)

where a(k) =qcakk/(2m)a(k), in momentum space. in arriving at this expression we

have expanded the currents and also absorbed the wzw-action part of the measure into
the denition of the wavefunctions, i.e., the operator (29) acts on  = ecas(h). the above

9

equation shows that the propagating particles in the perturbative regime, where the power
series expansion of the current is appropriate, have a mass m = e2ca/2. this value can
therefore be identied as the magnetic mass of the gluons as given by this nonperturbative
analysis.

for su (2) our result is m  0.32e2. there have been two lattice calculations of the
propagator mass of gluons for su (2); the values are m  0.35e2 and 0.46e2 [13, 14]. there
is reasonable evidence for a constituent gluon picture for glueballs in y m3 from lattice
analysis, so another suggestion has been to extract a constituent mass for a gluon and
interpret it as the magnetic mass [15]. this gives a value m  0.31e2  0.40e2. considering
the diculties of a lattice estimate and the variance within these calculations, we cannot
draw any denite conclusion in comparing with our analysis.

8. excited states

eventhough j is useful as a description of the gluon, it is not a physical state. this
is because of an ambiguity in our parametrization (1). notice that the matrices m and
m v (z) both give the same a, a, where v (z) only depends on z and not z. since we have
the same potentials, physical results must be insensitive to this redundancy in the choice
of m ; in other words, physical wavefunctions must be invariant under m  m v (z). j is
not invariant; we need at least two js to form an invariant combination. an example is

2 = zx,y

f (x, y)[ ja(x)(h(x, y)h 1(y, y))ab

jb(y)]

(30)

this is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian. since there are two js we should expect
at least a mass of 2m, but beyond that it is dicult to say anything very conclusive, see
however [2].
