abstract

we investigate the production of gravitinos in a cosmological background. gravitinos can be pro-
duced during preheating after ination due to a combined eect of interactions with an oscillating
inaton eld and absence of conformal invariance. in order to get insight on conformal proper-
ties of gravitino we reformulate phenomenological supergravity in su (2, 2|1)-symmetric way. the
planck mass and f- and d-terms appear via the gauge-xed value of a supereld that we call
conformon. we nd that in general the probability of gravitino production is not suppressed by
the small gravitational coupling. this may lead to a copious production of gravitinos after ina-
tion. eciency of the new non-thermal mechanism of gravitino production is very sensitive to the
choice of the underlying theory. this may put strong constraints on certain classes of inationary
models.

1 introduction

the possibility of excessive production of gravitinos is one of the most complicated problems
of cosmological models based on supergravity. such particles decay very late, and lead to
disastrous cosmological consequences unless the ratio of the number density of gravitinos
n3/2 to the entropy density s is extremely small. for example, the ratio of the number
density of gravitinos n3/2 to the entropy density s should be smaller than o(1014) for
gravitinos with mass o(100) gev [1, 2]. the standard thermal mechanism of gravitino
production involves scattering of particles at high temperature in the early universe. to
avoid excessive production of gravitinos one must assume that the reheating temperature
of the universe after ination was smaller than 108  109 gev [1, 2].

however, gravitinos can be produced not only in the thermal bath after reheating,
but even earlier, during the oscillations of the inaton eld at the end of ination. we
already know that bosons as well as spin 1/2 fermions can be copiously produced by the
coherently oscillating inaton eld. quite often this eect occurs in a non-perturbative way
during the stage of preheating [3, 4]. similar eect may occur for gravitinos. according
to [5], nonthermal gravitino/moduli production may rule out certain classes of inationary
models which otherwise would be quite legitimate.

the theory of the cosmological gravitino production is very complicated. recently
[6] (see
production of transversal gravitino components (helicity 3/2) was studied in ref.
also [7] where an attempt has been made to study this question using perturbation the-
ory). in this paper we will investigate production of all gravitino components, transversal
(helicity 3/2) and longitudinal (helicity 1/2). as we will show, the production rate of the
longitudinal gravitino component can be much greater than that of the transversal gravitino
components.1

since gravitino is a part of the gravitational multiplet, one could expect that their
production must be strongly suppressed by the small gravitational coupling. indeed, usually
the production of particles occurs because their eective mass changes nonadiabatically
during the oscillations of the inaton eld [3]. this is the main eect responsible for the
production of the gravitinos with helicity 3/2. the gravitino mass m at small values of the
inaton eld  is proportional to m2
p w , where w is a superpotential. thus the amplitude
of the oscillations of the gravitino mass is suppressed by m2
p . that is why production of
the gravitino components with helicity 3/2 is relatively inecient [6, 7].

there is another mechanism to be considered, which is related to breaking of con-
formal invariance [5]. it is well known, for example, that expansion of the universe does not
lead to production of massless vector particles and massless fermions of spin 1/2 because
the theory of such particles is conformally invariant and the friedmann universe is confor-
mally at. meanwhile, massless scalar particles minimally coupled to gravity (as well as

1in at spacetime, transversal components, which exist even if supersymmetry is unbroken, correspond
to the helicity 3/2, while longitudinal components with non-vanishing 0 and ii correspond to the helicity
1/2. although the helicity concept has a less precise meaning in frw metrics, we still will use this loose
denition as a shortcut to the transversal and longitudinal components.

cles is not conformally invariant. the rate of scalar particle production is determined by
the hubble constant h  a
are possible for gravitinos, they could be much stronger than the eects discussed in the
previous paragraph. indeed, h is suppressed only by the rst degree of m1
p . as a result
h typically is much greater than m3/2 after ination, so its time-dependence may lead to a
more ecient particle production.

p q/3, where  is the energy density. if similar eects

a = m1

the issue of conformal invariance of gravitinos is rather nontrivial, and until now it
has not been thoroughly examined. for gravitinos with helicity 3/2 the eects proportional
to h do not appear, and therefore the violation of conformal invariance for such particles
is very small, being proportional to their mass [6]. however, as we will show, the theory of
gravitinos with helicity 1/2 is not conformally invariant, and therefore such particles will
be produced during the expansion of the universe even if one neglects their mass.

but the most surprising eect which we have found is that the production of the
gravitinos of helicity 1/2 by the oscillating scalar eld  in general is not suppressed by any
powers of m1
p , and therefore their production can be very ecient. the magnitude of the
eect is model-dependent. for example, this eect does not occur in the simplest model of
a single chiral multiplet with a quadratic eective potential m2
2/2. meanwhile this eect
is very strong in the theory with the eective potential 4/4. gravitinos in this theory are
produced very quickly, within about ten oscillations of the inaton eld, with occupation

numbers nk  1/2 over a large range of momenta k  , which is very dierent from

usual perturbative production.

this result may have important cosmological implications, since it may allow to
rule out certain classes of cosmological theories. the nature of this eect resembles the
well known fact that the longitudinal components of massive vector bosons at high energy
behave in the same way as the goldstone boson that was eaten by the vector eld [8].
a similar eect is known to exist in the theory of technicolor [9]. a more direct analogy
is the transmutation of gravitational interactions of gravitinos with helicity 1/2 to weak
interactions found by fayet [10]. in our case the eect is nonperturbative, and its adequate
interpretation is achieved by nding solutions of the gravitino equations in a nontrivial
self-consistent cosmological background.

in order to study conformal properties of gravitinos we reformulated the standard
n=1 phenomenological supergravity in an su(2, 2|1)-invariant way, which makes the confor-
mal properties of the theory manifest and explains how the conformal symmetry is broken.
our formulation describes arbitrary number of chiral and vector multiplets and is exible
enough to allow investigation of regimes where the superpotential w vanishes.

in application to the theory of gravitino production, we concentrate on the simplest
models with one chiral multiplet  and arbitrary superpotential. we present classical
equations of motion and constraints for the transverse and longitudinal gravitino in the
expanding friedmann universe interacting with the moving inaton eld. we use the gauge
where the goldstino is absent. then we solve classical equations for gravitino. this solution
conrms the generic prediction from the su(2, 2|1)-symmetric theory that the longitudinal

2

gravitinos are not conformal.

we represent equations describing gravitino components with helicities 3/2 and 1/2
in a form analogous to the equations for the usual spin 1/2 fermions with time-dependent
mass. this allows to reduce, to a certain extent, the problem of gravitino production to the
problem of production of particles with spin 1/2 after preheating [4].

finally, we estimate the number density of gravitinos produced by the oscillating
scalar eld in several inationary models, and show that in some models the ratio n3/2/s
may substantially exceed the bound n3/2/s  o(1014).

a detailed account of our investigation will be given in a separate publication [11].
here we will only outline the main points of our study and present the most interesting
results.

2 supergravity lagrangian and conformal properties

of gravitino

fundamental m-theory, which should encompass both supergravity and string theory, at
present experiences rapid changes. one may still expect that the low-energy physics will
be described by the n=1 d=4 supergravity [12] and address the issues of the early universe
cosmology in the context of the most general phenomenological n=1 supergravityyang
mills-matter theory [13].

we are interested in conformal properties of supergravity elds, which include var-

ious spin elds, in the conformally at frw metric describing the early universe:

g(x) = a2() .

(2.1)

in particular, we will be interested in conformal properties of gravitino. supergravity is
not a conformally invariant theory, despite the fact that it has a long history of being
derived using the superconformal tensor calculus [14] as a technical tool. therefore it is
dicult even to address this issue as the supergravity elds do not have specic conformal
weights. to solve this problem, the idea is to view the supergravity theory as a gauge-
xed version of the conformally invariant theory describing the most general n = 1 gauge
theory superconformally coupled to supergravity [11]. the derivation su(2, 2|1) invariant
lagrangian of n = 1 supergravity coupled to n + 1 chiral multiplets (with complex scalars
xi and fermions i) and yangmills vector multiplets (with gauginos  and vectors w 
 )
superconformally will be presented in [11]. it has no dimensional parameters. it consists
of 3 parts, depending, respectively, on a real function n , a holomorphic function w and a
gauge group 2-tensor f. each of them is conformally invariant by itself.

(2.2)

the statement of the su(2, 2|1) symmetry of the action (2.2) includes, among others, the
symmetries under the following set of local dilatations, with parameter (x), for the metric

3

and gravitino, for the scalars and spinors of the chiral multiplets, and for the vectors and
spinors of the gauge multiplet, respectively:

g = e2(x)g ,
xi = e(x)xi ,
w 
 = w 
 ,

i = e

= e

2 [(x)] ,
2 (x)i ,
2 (x) .

3

(2.3)
the function of scalars n (x, x) codies the information on kahler manifold. the holo-
morphic function of scalars w(x) codies the superpotential. they transform as follows
under local dilatations:

3

n (x, x) = e2(x)n (x, x) ,

w(x) = e3(x)w(x) ,

f(x) = f(x) .

(2.4)

the important term in the conformal action which allows us to distinguish between confor-
mal properties of helicity 3/2 and 1/2 gravitino is the following:

[n ]de1 =

1

6n (x, x)(cid:16)r + r + e1(e   )(cid:17) + . . . .

(2.5)

the gauge xing of the local dilatation of the conformally invariant action presented in [11]
leads to the standard2 poincare supergravity theory.

the dimensionful constants, plank mass and f- and d-terms, appear via the gauge
xed value of the conformal compensator supereld, which we call conformon. the original
n + 1 complex variables xi are split into one complex scalar conformon eld , and n
physical complex scalars zi, which are hermitian coordinates for parametrizing the kahler
manifold in the poincare theory. one denes

xi =  xi (zi) ,

(2.6)

and the local dilatation takes the form in which only the conformon  transforms and the
physical scalars do not transform under the local dilatation

 = e(x) ,

zi = zi .

(2.7)

in these variables the gauge-xing of the dilatational invariance (2.3), (2.7) is given by

n (, z, z) = 3||2 exp(cid:16) 1

3 k(z, z)(cid:17) = 3m 2

p ,

(2.8)

where the rst equation denes k(z, z), which is the kahler potential, and the second is

the gauge xing. here mp  mp lanck/8  2  1018 gev. thus the conformon eld 
2 in fact two dierent gauges can be used to x the r-part of the superconformal symmetry. with the
rst choice w = w  we get the n=1 phenomenological supergravity [13] depending on g, while the second
one  =  gives the version which is non-singular in the limit of the vanishing superpotential w = 0. this
version is closer to the one in [15] which was obtained by the superspace methods. the limit w = 0 from
the rst version has been discussed at the end of [16]. however, we nd the second version more suitable
for cosmology. it will be presented below.

is frozen to || = mp exp(cid:16) 1

it becomes a functional of the kahler potential
and not an independent eld. the theory becomes that of the poincare supergravity theory
with

6 k(z, z)(cid:17), i.e.

[n ]de1 = 

1
2

m 2

p (cid:16)r + r(cid:17) + . . . .

(2.9)

here r = d, where d is a covariant derivative. the local dilatation of the metric
and gravitino in (2.3) is not compensated anymore by the local dilatation of scalars,

 =  6= e(x) ,

n (x, x) = n (x, x) 6= e2(x)n (x, x) .

the same happens with the w part of the theory:

w(x) = 3m3

p w (z)

=

w(x) = w(x) 6= e3(x)w(x) .

we have chosen here to give w mass dimension 3.

(2.10)

(2.11)

thus, after the freezing of the conformon eld some part of the transformation
cannot be performed and therefore some parts of the phenomenological supergravity la-
grangian are not invariant under dilatations. one can try to change the dilatational weight
for these elds to compensate the appearance of powers of mp . however, this does not help,
since the terms with derivatives on the conformon eld are absent after the gauge xing.
the gravitino eld equation which follows from the superconformal action is

r   lnn +    lnn + . . . = 0 .

(2.12)

in the frw cosmological problems only time derivatives of the scalar elds are important,

therefore in  lnn only the term 00 lnn is relevant. after gauge xing the

conformal symmetry will be broken for congurations for which either

   6= 0

or

0 6= 0 .

(2.13)

only such terms will be sensitive to the absence of the terms 0 lnn due to gauge
xing3 when n = 3m 2
p . the gravitino in the general theory with spontaneously broken
supersymmetry will be massive. the states of a free massive spin 3/2 particle were studied
by auvil and brehm in [18] (see also [2] for the nice review). a free massive gravitino has
   = 0. helicity 3/2 states are given by transverse space components of gravitino,
t
i . helicity 1/2 states are given by the time component of the gravitino eld 0. in
cases when gravitino interacts with gravity and other elds, we will nd that    6= 0. it
will be a function of 0. thus the consideration of superconformal symmetry lead us to a
conclusion that helicity 1/2 states of gravitino are not conformally coupled to the metric.
when these states are absent, the 3/2 helicity states are conformally coupled (up to the
mass terms, as usual). thus the conformal properties of gravitino are simple, as it is known

3in [17], where an attempt to study conformal properties of gravitino has been made, it was assumed
that    = 0 = 0 and conformal symmetry of gravitino was deduced in the context of pure supergravity.
without scalars, however, pure supergravity does not support a cosmological background. in the presence
of matter the assumption that    = 0 = 0 is not valid and conformal symmetry is broken.

5

for scalars: if the action has an additional term 1
12 2r, the massless scalars are conformal.
if this term is absent, the scalars are not conformal. note that both these statements are
derivable from the superconformal action. we will see the conrmation of this prediction
in the solutions of the gravitino equations below.

as we already explained, our formulation starting with superconformal action [11]
provides exibility in the choice of the form of n = 1 phenomenological supergravity. if we
take w = w gauge for r-symmetry, we get the action [13] depending on the combination
of the kahler potential and the superpotential, called g. here we use the  =  gauge for
r-symmetry and present the form of the phenomenological lagrangian in which the kahler
potential and the superpotential are not combined in one function. this allows to avoid
problems which sometimes appear when the superpotential w vanishes. the action can be
written as

in general background metrics in the presence of complex scalar elds with non-vanishing

 (see (2.16))
and various mixing terms like those in the 4th, 5th and 6th lines of the phenomenological
lagrangian (2.14). for a self-consistent setting of the problem, the gravitino equation
should be supplemented by the equations for the elds mixing with gravitino, as well as
by the equations determining the gravitational background and the evolution of the scalar
elds.

2 w , the right hand side contains a chiral connection ab

let us make some simplications. we consider the supergravity multiplet and a
single chiral multiplet containing a complex scalar eld z = 
with a superpotential w
mp
and a single chiral fermion . this is a simple non-trivial extension which allows to study
gravitino in the non-trivial frw cosmological metric supported by the scalar eld. a
nice feature of this model is that the chiral fermion  can be gauged to zero so that the
mixing between  and  in (2.14) is absent. we also can choose the non-vanishing vev
of the scalar eld in the real direction, re  = 2
 = 0. the eld

where  stands for a conformal time derivative . it is important that the covariant deriva-
tive in these equations must include both the spin connection and the christoel symbols,
otherwise equation d = 0 used for the derivation of these equations is not valid.

the last equation will be especially important for us. naively, one could expect
that in the limit mp  , gravitinos should completely decouple from the background.
however, this equation implies that this is not the case for the gravitinos with helicity 1/2.
indeed, from (3.4) one can nd an algebraic relation between 00 and ii:

00 = aii .

(3.5)

here a is a matrix which will play a crucial role in our description of the interaction of
gravitino with the varying background elds. if  and p are the background energy-density

slowly rolls down. one can construct a superpotential w which provides chaotic ination for  > mp .
when (t) drops below  mp , it begins to oscillate coherent oscillations around the minimum of its the
eective potential v ().

we will use the representation of gamma matrices where 0 = diag (i, i,i,i). then in

(one can show that |a| = 1 for the theories with one chiral multiplet even if the kahler is
not minimal.) therefore a can be represented as5

the expression for  becomes much simpler and its interpretation is more trans-
parent if the amplitude of oscillations of the eld  is much smaller than mp . in the limit
/mp  0 one has

 = w .

(3.11)

this coincides with the mass of both elds of the chiral multiplet (the scalar eld and
spin 1/2 fermion) in rigid supersymmetry. when supersymmetry is spontaneously broken,
the chiral fermion, goldstino, is eaten by gravitino which becomes massive and acquires
helicity 1/2 states in addition to helicity 3/2 states of the massless gravitino.

the matrix a does not become constant in the limit mp  . the phase (3.9)
rotates when the background scalar eld oscillates. the amplitude and sign of a change
two times within each oscillation. consequently, the relation between 00 and ii also
oscillates during the eld oscillations. this means that the gravitino with helicity 1/2 (which
is related to 0) remains coupled to the changing background even in the limit mp  .
in a sense, the gravitino with helicity 1/2 remembers its goldstino nature. this is the main
reason why the gravitino production in this background in general is not suppressed by the
gravitational coupling. the main dynamical quantity which is responsible for the gravitino
production in this scenario will not be the small changing gravitino mass m(t), but the mass
of the chiral multiplet , which is much larger than m. as we will see, this leads to ecient
5initial conditions at ination at    correspond to p = , m = 0 and a = 1, which gives
() = 0. alternatively, we can start with inaton oscillations at  = 0, which denes the phase up to
some constant. the nal results depend only on .

we shall solve the master equation (3.1) using the constraint equations in the form
(3.4) and (3.3). we use plane-wave ansatz   eikx for the space-dependent part. then
i can be decomposed6 [19] into its transverse part t
i , the trace ii and the trace k  :
ki

where ki = ki/|k|, so that it
i = 0. we will relate ii with 0 and with k  ,
so that, after use of the eld equations there are two degrees of freedom associated with
the transverse part t
i , which correspond to helicity 3/2; and two degrees of freedom
associated with ii (or 0) which correspond to helicity 1/2.

in the limit of vanishing gravitino mass, the transverse part t

i reduces the equation for the transverse part to the
free dirac equation with a time-varying mass term ma. it is well known how to treat this
type of equations (e.g. see [4]). the essential part of t
is given by the time-dependent part

4 gravitino production

one could expect that the gravitino production may begin already at the stage of ination,
due to the breaking of conformal invariance. however, there is no massive particle produc-
tion in de sitter space (i.e. as long as one can neglect the motion of the scalar eld during
ination). indeed, expansion in de sitter space is in a sense ctitious; one can always use
coordinates in which it is collapsing or even static. an internal observer living in de sitter
space would not see any time-dependence of his surroundings caused by particle production;
he will only notice that he is surrounded by particle excitations at the hawking temperature
h/2.

gravitino production may occur at the stage of ination due to the (slow) motion of
the scalar eld, but the most interesting eects occur at the end of ination, when the scalar
eld  rapidly rolls down toward the minimum of its eective potential v () and oscillates
there. during this stage the vacuum uctuations of the gravitino eld are amplied, which
corresponds to the gravitino production (in a squeezed state).

production of gravitinos with helicity 3/2 is described in terms of the mode function
yt (). this function obeys the equation (3.14) with t = ma, which is suppressed by
m2
p . non-adiabaticity of the eective mass t () results in the departure of yt () from
its positive frequency initial condition eik, which can be interpreted as particle production.
the theory of this eect is completely analogous to the theory of production of usual
fermions of spin 1/2 and mass m [4]. indeed, eq. (3.14) coincides with the basic equation
which was used in [4] for the investigation of production of dirac fermions during preheating.

the description of production of gravitinos with helicity 1/2 is similar but somewhat
more involved. the wave function of the helicity 1/2 gravitino is a product of the factor e()
and the function yl(). the factor e() does not depend on momenta and controls only
the overall scaling of the solution. it is the function yl() that controls particle production
which occurs because of the non-adiabatic variations of the eective mass parameter l().
the function yl() obeys the equation (3.22) with the eective mass l(), which is given
by the superposition (3.23) of all three mass scales in the problem: , h and m.

in dierent models of the ination, dierent terms of l will have dierent impact
on the helicity 1/2 gravitino production. the strongest eect usually comes from the largest
mass scale , if it is varying with time. this makes the production of gravitinos of helicity
1/2 especially important.

to fully appreciate this fact, one should note that if instead of considering super-
gravity one would consider susy with the same superpotential, then the goldstino  (which
is eaten by the gravitino in supergravity) would have the mass w , which coincides with
 in the limit of large mp , see eq. (3.11). as a result, eq. (3.22) describing creation of
gravitinos with helicity 1/2 at   mp looks exactly as the equation describing creation
of goldstinos in susy. that is why production of gravitinos with helicity 1/2 may be very
ecient: in a certain sense it is not a gravitational eect. (on the other hand, the decay
rate of gravitinos   m3/m 2
p is very small because it is suppressed by the gravitational
coupling m2

p .)

12

this does not mean that one can always neglect terms proportional to h and m as
compared to , and that production of gravitinos with helicity 3/2 can always be neglected.
in order to understand the general picture, we will consider several toy models where the
eective potential at the end of ination has simple shape such as v  n. we will not
discuss here the problem of nding superpotentials which lead to such potentials (and
ination) at  > mp [20], because we are only interested in what happens after the end of
ination, which occurs at   mp .

first consider the superpotential w = 1

2 m2. at   mp it leads to the simple
m2
2 2. the parameter  in this case coincides with the inaton

quadratic potential v =
mass m. in a realistic inationary model one should take m  1013 gev, which is equal
to 5  106mp [20]. hubble constant during the eld oscillations is given by m06mp
, where
0(t) here is the amplitude of the eld oscillations, which decreases during the expansion of
the universe. the gravitino mass is given by m = m2
4m 2
p

.

thus, at the end of ination in this model, which occurs at   mp , all parameters
determining the behavior of the gravitino wave function are of the same order,   m 
h  m. however, later the amplitude of  decreases as 0  1.5mp
4n , where n is the
number of oscillations of the eld  after the end of ination [3]. thus already after a single
oscillation there emerges a hierarchy of scales,   m  h  m.

mt  mp

since m = const, after the rst oscillation the parameter  becomes nearly con-
stant, the parameters h and m become very small, and their contribution to the gravitino
production becomes strongly suppressed. as a result, the dominant contribution to the
gravitino production in this model occurs within the rst oscillation of the scalar eld after
the end of ination. each of the parameters , h, and m at the end of ination changes by
o(m) within the time o(m1
 ). this means that (because of uncertainty relation) graviti-
nos of both helicities will be produced, they will have physical momenta k = o(m), and
their occupation numbers nk will be not much smaller than o(1). this leads to the following
conservative estimate of the number density of produced gravitinos: n3/2  102m3
.

now let us assume for a moment that all energy of the oscillating eld  transfers to
thermal energy  t 4 within one oscillation of the eld . this produces gas with entropy
density s  t 3  (cid:18) m2

. as a result, the ratio n3/2 to the entropy density becomes

2 (cid:19)3/4

m 2
p

n3/2

s  102(cid:18) m

mp(cid:19)3/2

 1010 .

(4.1)

this violates the bound n3/2
s < 1014 for the gravitino with m  102 gev by about 4 orders
of magnitude. thus one may encounter the gravitino problem even if one neglects their
thermal production.

in this particular model one can overcome the gravitino problem if reheating and
thermalization occurs suciently late. indeed, during the post-inationary expansion the
number density of gravitinos decreases as a3. the energy density of the oscillating massive
scalar eld  = m2
0(t)/2 also decreases as a3. but the entropy produced at the moment

2

13

of reheating is proportional to 3/4, so it depends on the scale factor at the moment of
reheating as a9/4. if reheating occurs late enough (which is necessary anyway to avoid
thermal production of gravitinos), the ratio n3/2
s  1010a3/4 becomes small, and the
gravitino problem does not appear.

but this simple resolution is not possible in some other models. as an example,

consider the model with the superpotential w = 3/3, which at   mp leads to
the eective potential 4/4. the oscillations of the scalar eld near the minimum of
a cn(0, 12). the frequency of
this potential are described by elliptic cosine, () = 0
oscillations is 0.84720 and initial amplitude 0  mp [3].
the parameter  for this model is given by  = 2. it rapidly changes in the
interval between 0 and 20. initially it is of the same order as h and m, but then h
and m rapidly decrease as compared to , and therefore the oscillations of  remain the
main source of the gravitino production. in this case production of gravitinos with helicity
1/2 is much more ecient than that of helicity 3/2.

the theory of production of gravitinos with helicity 1/2 in this model is similar to
the theory of production of spin 1/2 fermions with mass 2 by the coherently oscillating
scalar eld in the theory 4/4. this theory has been investigated in [4]. the result can be
formulated as follows. even though the expression for  contains a small factor 2, one
cannot use the perturbation expansion in . this is because the frequency of the background
eld oscillations is also proportional to . growth of fermionic modes (3.22) occurs in
the non-perturbative regime of parametric excitation. the modes get fully excited with
occupation numbers np  1/2 within about ten oscillations of the eld , and the width of
the parametric excitation of fermions in momentum space is about 0. this leads to the
following estimate for the energy density of created gravitinos,

and the number density of gravitinos

3/2  (0)4  v (0) ,

n3/2  3/4v 3/4(0) .

(4.2)

(4.3)

now let us suppose that at some later moment reheating occurs and the energy
density v (0) becomes transferred to the energy density of a hot gas of relativistic particles
with temperature t  v 1/4. then the total entropy of such particles will be s  t 3  v 3/4,
so that
(4.4)

n3/2
s  3/4  1010 .

this result violates the cosmological constraints on the abundance of gravitinos with mass
 102 gev by 4 orders of magnitude.
s does not depend on
the time of thermalization, because both n3/2 and v (0)3/4 decrease as a3. to avoid this
problem one may, for example, change the shape of v () at small , making it quadratic.
the situation in models with v ()  n for n > 4 is even more dangerous because
the energy density of the oscillating eld  in such models decreases faster than a4, so
the entropy of the particles produced during reheating is suppressed stronger than by the

in this model the ratio n3/2

14

factor of a3. the later reheating occurs in such models, the greater will be the resulting
ratio n3/2
s .
the most dangerous situation occurs in the class of inationary models where the
eective potential v () does not have a minimum, but instead monotonically decreases
and becomes at at   . such models have been studied recently by many authors
[21, 5], which gave them many dierent names: deation, kination, and quintessential
ination. following [5], we will call them non-oscillatory (no) models, which reects an
unusual non-oscillatory behavior of the scalar eld after ination. this behavior implies
that the standard mechanism of reheating does not work in no models. therefore until
very recently it was assumed that in such models all particles are produced gravitationally,
due to the breaking of conformal invariance [21]. a typical model of such type has the
eective potential which is given by v ()  4/4 at  < 0, and then it rapidly vanishes
as  becomes positive, so that v ()  0 at   .

we will leave apart the question whether it is easy to obtain realistic versions of no
models in supergravity. for us it is only important that in such models the parameters ,

h and m change by o(0) = o(h) during the time when the eld  rolls from 0  mp
to 0. just as in one of the examples considered above, this should lead to production of
gravitinos with number density which can be estimated as  102h 3. this number is of the
same order as the number density of all other conformally noninvariant particles produced
by gravitational eects in the scenario of ref. [21]. thus, barring the subsequent dilution
of gravitinos by some late-time entropy release, one has n3/2/s = o(1), which contradicts
observational data by 14 orders of magnitude.

this problem of no models can be resolved if one assumes that the scalar eld 
interacts with some other particles  with a suciently large coupling constant g. this
leads to production of particles in the context of the instant preheating scenario [22]. this
mechanism is much more ecient than the gravitational particle production studied in [21],
and the entropy s of produced particles becomes much greater than o(h 3). this leads to
a strong suppression of n3/2/s [5].

but do we really have the gravitino problem in all of these models? in our investiga-
tion we studied only the models with one chiral multiplet. this is good enough to show that
nonthermal gravitino production may indeed cause a serious problem, but much more work
should be done in order to check whether the problem actually exists in realistic models
with several dierent chiral and vector multiplets.

first of all, one should write and solve a set of equations involving several multiplets.
even in the case of one multiplet it is extremely dicult, and the results which we obtained
are very unexpected. the situation with many multiplets is even more involved. one
possibility is to consider the limit mp  , since the most interesting eects should still
exist in this limit.

but this is not the only problem to be considered. in the toy models studied in
3, the superpotential w and the gravitino
this section with w = 1
mass vanish in the minimum of the potential at  = 0. then after the end of oscillations
supersymmetry is restored, superhiggs eect does not occur and instead of massive grav-

2m2 and w = 1

3

15

itinos we have ordinary chiral fermions.
in order to study production of gravitino with
helicity 1/2 with nonvanishing mass m  102 gev one must introduce additional terms in
the superpotential, and make sure that these terms do not lead to a large vacuum energy
density.

models with one chiral supereld which satisfy all of these requirements do exist.

the simplest one is the polonyi model with w = ((2  3)mp + ). one can introduce

various generalizations of this model. however, potentials in all models of this type that
we were able to construct are much more complicated than the potentials of the toy models
studied in this section. in particular, if one simply adds small terms  +  + ... to the
superpotentials  2 or 3, one typically nds that v becomes negative in the minimum
of the potential, which sometimes becomes shifted to the direction 2, where  = (1 +
i2)/2. this problem can be easily cured in realistic theories with many multiplets, which
is another reason to study such models.

it would be most important to verify, in the context of these models, validity of our
observation that the probability of production of gravitinos of helicity 1/2 is not suppressed
by the gravitational coupling. we have found, for example, that the ratio n3/2
for the
s
gravitinos with helicity 1/2 in the model 4/4 is suppressed by 3/4. this suppression
is still rather strong because the coupling constant  is extremely small in this model,
  1013. however, in such models as the hybrid ination scenario all coupling constants
typically are o(101) [23]. if production of gravitinos in such models is suppressed only
by powers of the coupling constants, one may need to take special precautions in order to
avoid producing excessively large number of gravitinos during preheating. we will return
to this question and present a more detailed description of the eects discussed above in a
separate publication [11].
