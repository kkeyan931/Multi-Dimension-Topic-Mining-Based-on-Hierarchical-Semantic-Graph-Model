there has been some speculation about relations of d-brane models of black holes to

arithmetic. in this note we point out that some of these speculations have implications

for a circle of questions related to the generalized riemann hypothesis on the zeroes of

1. introduction

in [1] some connections were made between string theoretic models of black holes and

certain issues in arithmetic. one of the more speculative suggestions in [1] was a proposal

that the entropy of bps black holes is related to an arithmetic height of certain arithmetic

varieties. in the present note we remark on some connections between these speculations

and some issues related to the riemann hypothesis. in particular, the speculations seem

most relevant to the question of landau-siegel zeroes, which are hypothetical zeroes of

l-functions very close to s = 1. (a precise denition is given in denition 4.4.)

in section 2 we review the theory of strominger-vafa [2]. in section 3 we summarize,

reformulate, and sharpen the statements from [1] whose implications we wish to explore.

in section 4 we provide some background information on analytic number theory and

dirichlet l-functions, and in section 5 we see how everything ts together. in particular, we

discuss a close interplay between the strominger-vafa prediction about black hole entropy,

the landau-siegel zero, and the minimal discriminant of an elliptic curve with complex

multiplication.

warnings: this note is written for a mixed audience of both string theorists and

analytic number theorists, so some trivial things are explained. we caution the reader at

the outset that the evidence for the height conjecture of [1] is slim, to say the least. thus,

this paper should be regarded as an exercise in pascals wager.

2. summary of the attractor mechanism and the strominger-vafa proposal

let x be a compact calabi-yau 3-fold, and let   h3(x; zz) be an integral homology

class. string theory associates two interesting mathematical objects to the pair (x, ):

a.) a nite-dimensional hermitian vector space h().
b.) another calabi-yau x, in the same complex structure moduli space as x.

we can interpret (a) and (b) both mathematically and physically. the physical setting
is the theory of bps black holes in d = 4, n = 2 compactications of type ii string on a
calabi-yau manifold x. we now explain (a) and (b) in a little more detail.

1

first consider (a).

in physics h() is the space of bps states of charge . the
denition of this space has not been completely rigorously formulated mathematically,

although this should be possible using the theory of d-branes. very roughly speaking
h() should be dened mathematically as follows. consider the moduli space m() of
pairs (, a) where  is a smooth special lagrangian submanifold of x in the homology
class , and a is a at u (1) connection on . the moduli space m() inherits a metric
from the calabi-yau metric on x, and h() is the l2-cohomology of m(). 1

now consider (b). by yaus theorem, a calabi-yau manifold may be specied by its

complex structure and its kahler class. x will belong to a family of calabi-yau manifolds
with complex structures in mcplx. (for what follows we will need to work on the universal

cover fmcplx.) the map (b) is provided by the attractor mechanism of ferrara, kallosh,
and strominger [3][4][5]. for each  there is a dynamical system on the moduli space fmcplx

and, for suitable , 2 the dynamical system will have a unique xed point x. associated

with the calabi-yau x is the normalized period

|z()|2 :=

|r |2
|rx
  |

where  is a nowhere vanishing holomorphic (3, 0) form on x.

(2.1)

the connection between objects (a) and (b) is provided by the strominger-vafa pro-

posal for the microstates accounting of black hole entropy [2]. the idea may be summarized

in the following four steps:

1. given a calabi-yau x, one may write a system of partial dierential equations for

a minkowski-signature 4-manifold m equipped with certain geometrical data (e.g. a

rank 1

2 b3(x) torus bundle with connection). these equations generalize the einstein
equations on m and are called the supergravity equations. a choice of charge vector

 is equivalent to a choice of boundary conditions for these equations. for appropriate

vectors  (those for which the normalized period has an isolated minimum in fmcplx),

the supergravity equations admit black hole solutions b(). using the supergravity
1 in the mirror formulation  would specify the chern classes of a coherent sheaf in the mirror

calabi-yau x, and m() would be the l2 cohomology of the moduli space of such sheaves.

2 some discussion of which  are suitable is given in [1].

2

equations one may compute the horizon area a() of the black hole solution b(). it
turns out that

a() = 4|z()|2.

(2.2)

we work in planck units planck = 1.

2. according to bekenstein and hawking a black hole is a thermodynamical object. it

has a temperature and an entropy, and the latter is given by:

ssugra() =

a()

4

.

3. according to boltzmann and planck, we have the exact formula:

smicro() = k log[w ()]

(2.3)

(2.4)

where w () is the dimension of the space of available states in the microcanonical
ensemble specied by the charges  and the energy m = |z()|. here k is boltzmanns
constant; we henceforth choose units with k = 1.

4. according to strominger and vafa, for charge vectors  which are in some sense large,

physical states formed by bps congurations of d3-branes in x with charge  can

be described macroscopically, in a supergravity approximation, by the black hole so-
lutions b() to the supergravity equations. from the microscopic, d-brane viewpoint
we identify w = dimh(), for all , large or small. the correspondence between
congurations of d-branes and the black hole solutions is formulated mathematically

as the statement that for large 

smicro()  ssugra().

(2.5)

putting all the above statements together one arrives at the mathematically startling

proposal that:

log[dimh()]  |z()|2

(2.6)

for large . both sides of equation (2.6) are susceptible of precise mathematical denition.

moreover, such a statement would be a deep and surprising mathematical fact. before

3

that becomes a reality, several clarications of the meaning of (2.6) must be carried out.

in particular we need:
1. a precise denition of h() and a denition of dimh() (since h() is a graded vector

space, we might well have to use a graded dimension.)

2. a precise statement of the meaning of large .
3. a precise statement of the meaning of the asymptotic symbol .

it is quite necessary to take a limit of large , in order to justify the supergravity

approximation to string theory, and thereby the connection to black holes. we will take it
to mean operationally that we consider sequences n of charges such that zn := |z(n)| 
. we refer to such a sequence of charges as a big sequence.

another subtlety which we would like to mention is the concept of eective asymp-

totics. for example, one could make a statement that a certain quantity is bounded, but

without being able to determine anything about the nature of the bound or even being

able to begin computing it. we will assume that the limiting behaviors of the physical

quantities are eective: that is, any time a constant (implicit or named) is asserted to

exist, one could furthermore explicitly compute or name such a constant.

2.1. versions of the strominger-vafa conjecture

point 3 above (below (2.6)) has not really been addressed in the literature. the

strominger-vafa conjecture (2.6) in fact admits several inequivalent formulations. two

plausible versions of the conjecture are:

ssv conjecture. (strong sv conjecture): if {n} is a big sequence then smicro() has
an asymptotic expansion in zn := |z(n)|. more precisely,
1
z

smicro(n)

(2.7)

z2
n

= 1 + o(cid:18) log zn

z2
n

,

n(cid:19),

where we use o-notation in the precise sense of asymptotics of sequences in n, and  (a
quantity discussed below) is positive.

this is an expectation based on the supergravity approach to black hole entropy for

cy 3-fold black holes. see, for examples, the discussions in [6][7][8]. the corrections

4

arise from both m -theory corrections to the 11d supergravity and from quantum eects

associated with the compactication. the quantity  in (2.7) depends on details of the

sequence n, e.g., on the details of the directions of the n in h 3(x; zz) as zn goes to innity.

the ssv conjecture might appear to be obvious from the point of view of supergravity.

however, a systematic scheme for calculating corrections to the leading order supergravity

approximation to m -theory is unkown. moreover, it is known that supergravity, which

treats charges as continuous, can miss subtle arithmetic properties.
(for example, the
number of u -duality classes of s with a xed value of |z()| can be 1 in supergravity,
but in fact is given by class numbers in the exact formulation [1].) the ssv conjecture is

also suggested by the proposed formulae for exact results on smicro() in the case when
x = s  e with s a k3 surface and e an elliptic curve [9]. using the cardy formula 3 one
can justify the ssv conjecture for this special class of calabi-yau 3-folds. however, the

existing proposals, based on elliptic genera of symmetric products are only rmly justied

for 5d black holes, and the extension to 4d black holes - even for compactication on a

six-dimensional torus - is nontrivial. moreover, the generalization of the existing proposals
for dimh() to generic calabi-yau 3-folds will be much more subtle and intricate.

for all these reasons, we are also willing to entertain the

wsv conjecture. (weak sv conjecture): if {n} is a big sequence then

lim
n

log smicro(n)

log z2
n

= 1.

(2.8)

of course, the ssv conjecture implies the wsv conjecture, but the converse is false.

the motivation behind the formulation of the wsv conjecture is the following. it might

be that for large , the microscopic entropy actually behaves like

smicro(n)  z2

n(log zn),

(2.9)

where  is a random variable, chosen using a measure on h3(x; zz). presumably the

distribution would become more sharply concentrated around  = 0 as  becomes larger.

3 the cardy formula is a generalization of the hardy-ramanujan formula for the asymptotics
of the partition function and gives the asymptotics of conformal eld theory partition functions.

5

as far as we know there is nothing wrong with this idea, and from some viewpoints it even

seems likely. for example, the existence of bps states can depend on arithmetic properties

of . so there might well be a large amount of scatter and noise in the behavior of
dimh() as   . (see fig. 1 in section 5 below for an illustration of the kind of scatter
we mean.) in this case the bekenstein-hawking formula would not be the leading term in

a systematic expansion, but would only hold in some average sense.

if the dimensions dimh() indeed behave in the way just suggested, then it is quite
possible that the limit (2.8) does not exist in the standard sense. in such a situation it

is more appropriate to use the lim-sup, (also denoted as lim) which always exists for any

sequence of real numbers. 4 thus we could replace the limits in the wsv conjecture by

lim or lim. we refer to these as the w sv and w sv conjectures, respectively.

there are yet other inequivalent formulations of the sv conjecture.

3. the height conjecture

3.1. sharpening the height conjecture

the main conjectures of [1] (conjectures 8.2.1, 8.2.2, and 8.2.3) posit that the attractor

variety x can be dened as an arithmetic variety over some number eld k. this was
veried in [1] in some special cases, for example when x is a free quotient of k3  e
(where e is an elliptic curve), or when x is a complex torus. in a much more speculative

section, [1] also suggested a possible connection between the faltings height for a metrized

line bundle ht(x; k) and the entropy. we want to investigate the consequences of these

latter conjectures.

we begin by making the height conjecture more precise. the rst point to note

is that if an attractor variety x indeed satises the attractor conjectures, then it might

nevertheless admit several dierent arithmetic models with quite dierent arithmetic

properties. first of all, changing the eld of denition of x can alter the arithmetic

4 we recall the denition. if an is any sequence of real numbers let bn = {an, an+1, . . .}. then
let cn := sup bn be the smallest constant bounding bn from above. plainly, the cn form a strictly

decreasing sequence of real numbers. we dene lim an = lim cn.

6

properties. we will not investigate the issues of base change systematically, although we

note that the faltings height does stabilize under eld extension [10]. a second ambiguity,

of more direct relevance to what follows, is that two varieties x, x over a eld k might
be isomorphic as varieties over an algebraic closure k (such as k = c for a number eld),

but fail to be isomorphic as varieties over k. we will quote some relevant examples in

section 3.3 below.

as with the sv conjecture, there are various inequivalent precise formulations of the

height conjecture:

strong height (sh) conjecture: assume a family of arithmetic attractor varieties
(xn, kn) corresponds to a big sequence, that is, zn := |z(n)|  . then there exists
a nite positive constant  (possibly depending on the family) and a choice of model for

xn such that if ht(x; k) is the faltings height for the metrized line bundle provided

by the calabi-yau data, then

ht(xn; kn)] = smicro(n) + o(|zn|2).

alternatively, with the same hypotheses, we can formulate the

exp(cid:2) 1



weak height (wh) conjecture:

lim
n

ht(xn; kn)
log[smicro(n)]

= .

(3.1)

(3.2)

of course, since not much is known about either numerator or denominator in (3.2),

it is prudent to allow alternative formulations w h, and w h of the conjectures, with

constants  and , respectively. if the wh or sh conjectures turn out to be true, then the

extent to which the constant  depends on the family of charges will become an interesting

question, as will become apparent in section ve.

let us return to the ambiguities of base-change and choice of model for x. regarding

base change, our hope is that the choice of base eld, while necessary to dene the heights,

should do no more than change the value of the constant  in the height conjectures.

regarding the choice of model, the attractor equation of supergravity only species

the attractor variety x as a variety over c. if x can be dened over a number eld

7

k, then since there can be inequivalent models over k we must ask if the choice of

model has any relevance for the physics of string compactication on x. a physicists

natural reaction to this question would be that the choice of model should be irrelevant,

by general covariance.

5 however, as seen in [1], the arithmetic of the number elds

associated to attractor varieties is related to such physical quantities as the bps mass

spectrum. whether or not the choice of arithmetic model is also of physical relevance

remains to be seen. in fact, the height conjectures above are the rst instance, of which

we are aware, in which such a choice really matters. this raises the interesting question

of whether physics indeed selects a distinguished arithmetic model. 6

3.2. a special class of attractor varieties

some weak evidence for the height conjecture was given in [1] in the case when x is

a complex torus. in this case it was shown that x is isogenous to a product of 3 elliptic

curves with complex multiplication:

x  e ()  e ()  e ()

(3.3)

where e := c/(zz+ zz) and  () = ipi4(). here i4() is an integral quartic polynomial

on h3(x; zz) related to the quartic e7,7 invariant (see [1] for precise denitions). moreover,

one easily veries in this example that:

|z()|2 =pi4(),

(3.4)

in order to estimate the

while the supergravity analysis shows that indeed ssugra() = pi4() [12][13][14].

equation (3.3) is only a statement about isogeny classes.

height it is more convenient (but not absolutely necessary) to pin down the attractor

5 roughly speaking, general covariance refers to invariance of a theory of gravity under c
dieomorphisms. a blind application of this principle would also suggest that complex structure

is physically irrelevant (which is hardly the case). the main thesis of this exploratory paper is

that not only complex structure, but even arithmetic structure is physically signicant.

6 a good place to start thinking about this might be wittens linear sigma model formulation
of cy sigma models, where a denite choice of projective model (albeit over c) is made by the

quantum eld theory [11].

variety exactly. we will eliminate the unkown isogeny by choosing diagonal charges.
that is, using equations (6.2)  (6.5) of [1], with p ij = piij , qij = qiij in the notation
of that paper, we may choose lattice vectors   h 3(x; zz) depending on eight integers
r, p1, p2, p3, s, q1, q2, and q3 such that we have the equality

x = e1  e2  e3,

where now we have

i4() = 2(cid:2)(

3xi=1

piqi)2 

3xi=1

and, dening d = i4 < 0, i are given by:

piqi)2 + 4(cid:0)rq1q2q3  sp1p2p3(cid:1)

3xi=1

(piqi)2(cid:3)  (rs +
2(cid:0)p1q1  p2q2  p3q3  rs(cid:1) + d

4(p2p3 + rq1)

1 =

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

with cyclic permutations on 123 giving the formulae for 2, 3.

now let us discuss some arithmetic associated with the elliptic curves ei. in general,

if  is of the form (b + d)/2a for integral a, b, d, with d < 0, then it follows that
zz +  zz is a proper fractional ideal for some order o of the eld kd := q(d). to be

more precise, let the minimal polynomial of  be a 2 + b + c = 0 where a, b, c are

integral. (note:
it need not be true that a = a, or b = b.) then by [15], lemma 7.5,
zz +  zz is a proper fractional ideal for the order o = zz + a zz of kd. in general, the
conductor of the order o will be larger than one. by [15], theorem 11.1, the value of the
modular function j( ) generates the ring class eld of this order, i.e., the ring class eld

is kd(j( )). it follows from (3.5) that x is at least dened over the compositum of three

such ring class elds (it might well be dened over a smaller eld).

we would like to eliminate some of the complications of general ring class elds and

work instead with the hilbert class eld bkd of kd. this will simplify the height compu-
tation below. as explained at length in [15], the distinct ideal classes of the ring of integers
o(kd) of kd have representatives zz + kzz. here k = 1, . . . , h(d), and h(d) is the class
number of kd. the complex numbers k have the form k = (bk +d)/2ak and are the

solutions in the upper half-plane to ak 2 + bk + ck = 0 where akx2 + bkxy + cky2 runs over

9

representatives of inequivalent primitive binary quadratic forms of discriminant d. we can

choose representatives in the standard keyhole fundamental domain for p sl(2, zz). we

will refer to the k as heegner points. one of the beautiful statements of the theory of

complex multiplication is that for any k, j(k) is an algebraic integer and bkd = kd(j(k)).

now let us consider some explicit charge vectors . first we take p = p1 = p2 = p3,

and q = q1 = q2 = q3 so that we only have to work with a single elliptic curve with modular

parameter  = 1 = 2 = 3 given by

 = 2(pq + rs) + d

.

4(p2 + rq)

here d reduces to i4, with i4 given by

i4(p, q, r, s) = 12p2q2 + 4(rq3  sp3)  (3pq + rs)2.

(3.8)

(3.9)

next we choose p, q, r, s so that  is one of the heegner points. we will content ourselves

with nding charge vectors d which yield the principal class (the trivial class). this is

given by

 = 1 + d

(3.10)
if d = 1 mod 4 and  = d if d = 0 mod 4. specically, if we choose r = 0 and
s = 3 + 4d, then with p = q = 4, we get (3.10). if p = 1, q = 2, we get

2

 = 1 + d,
which is clearly p sl(2, zz)-equivalent to  = d.

(3.11)

presumably, other charges  can lead to other ideal classes in kd, but we will focus

on the above sequence of charges in this paper, and will call them d. as explained in

the next section, we will take bkd as the eld of denition of the special attractor varieties

associated with the charges d.

3.3. silvermans formula for the height of an arithmetic elliptic curve

now that we have focused on the attractors xd let us compute their height. since

xd is a product of 3 elliptic curves we have

ht(xd ; bkd) = 3ht(e (d); bkd),

10

(3.12)

and therefore we need only compute the height of an elliptic curve. this has been done in

a very explicit way by silverman in chapter 10 of [10]. we now review his formula. in the

next section we apply the formula to our considerations.

to begin, we must review a few standard denitions. (see any textbook on elliptic

curves, for examples [16][17][18].) let k be a eld. an elliptic curve e/k can be given

by a weierstrass model

y2 + a1xy + a3y = x3 + a2x2 + a4x + a6

(3.13)

where ai  k. two equivalent weierstrass models for the same curve over k are related
by a change of coordinates

x = u2x + r

y = u3y + su2x + t

with u  k, r, s, t  k.

we introduce the discriminant  through the standard denitions:

b2 := a2

1 + 4a2

b4 := a1a3 + 2a4

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

b6 := a2

b8 := a2

3 + 4a6
1a6  a1a3a4 + 4a2a6 + a2a2
2  24b4
2 + 36b2b4  216b6
2b8  8b3

4  27b2

6 + 9b2b4b6

c4 := b2
c6 := b3
 := b2

3  a2

4

if the elliptic curve is nonsingular then  6= 0 and we can dene the j-invariant:

j := c3

4/.

when the characteristic is not 2 or 3 it is useful to note that 2633 = c3

4  c2
6.

under the change of variables (3.14) we have:
c4 = u4c4

c6 = u6c6

 = u12

j = j

11

curves with the same j-invariant are isomorphic over the algebraic closure of k, but need

not be isomorphic over k.

now let k be a number eld and e an elliptic curve over k. the eld k has a

set of valuations. these consist of archimedean valuations (the places at innity) and

nonarchimedean valuations (the nite places). the places at innity correspond to

inequivalent embeddings of k into ir or c. in our example below all the embeddings will
be complex embeddings i : k  c, so we henceforth assume this is the case for k. under
these embeddings e(c) will be isomorphic to c/(zz + izz). the nite places correspond to

valuations labelled by the dierent prime ideals in k. let p be a prime ideal in k. we

can then consider the curve ep over the p-adic completion kp which is just given by the

same equation for e as before, but now considered over this larger eld. let ()p be the
discriminant of ep (this is an ideal in o(kp)). a minimal model for ep (at p) is obtained
by making changes of coordinates of the form (3.14) (with the eld now taken to be kp)

such that the power of p dividing ()p is the smallest possible. for the minimal model
let us say pnp|()p, but pnp+1 6 |()p. in particular, if e is smooth at p then np = 0,
and np > 0 only at those primes which divide () in the global model of e. taking the

product over all the nite places of k denes the minimal discriminant of e as an ideal

in k:

de/k :=yp

pnp .

(3.18)

we can now state silvermans formula for the height of e/k (proposition 1.1, p. 254

in [10].) 7 the formula for the height involves the sum of the contributions from the nite

and innite places:

12[k : q]ht(e; k) = log|nk/q(de/k )|  2xi

log(cid:20)(i)6|24(i)|(2)12(cid:21)

(3.19)

where nk/q is the norm of the ideal, the second term is the sum over inequivalent complex
embeddings of k, and ( ) is the dedekind function.

7 we will not dene the height. see, for examples, [19][10][20] for denitions. for expository
discussions see [21][22]. curiously, the faltings height has appeared before in string theory. see,

for example, [23], and related papers. we do not understand any connection to this work.

12

now, to apply (3.19) we must choose a eld of denition and a weierstrass model

for our attractor varieties with  given by (3.10) or (3.11). this will introduce some
arbitrariness into our discussion. we motivate our choice as follows. if j 6= 0, (12)3 then
one can always write a model for an elliptic curve over q(j) with invariant j by taking:

y2 = 4x3 

27j

j  1728

(x + 1).

(3.20)

thus, one obvious model for the attractor varieties is obtained by making a transformation

of the form (3.14) to get

y2 = 4x3  g2x  g3
g2 = 27j(j  (12)3)
g3 = 27j(j  (12)3)2
 = g3

2  27g2

3 = 26  312  j2(j  (12)3)3.

(3.21)

. note too that the

note that we are taking the coecients in the ring of integers obkd

hilbert class eld is not the minimal eld of denition of this curve. we could take q(j( )).

however, this eld has many dierent conjugates inside the hilbert class eld, depending

on which heegner point  is taken. thus we nd the hilbert class eld more natural.

it is important to note that (3.21) is not the only weierstrass model we could choose.

we can illustrate the kinds of ambiguities we face in the following two simple sets of

examples. consider two families of elliptic curves over q labelled by an integer n

y2 = x3 + n

y2 = x3 + nx.

(3.22)

the rst family has j = 0, c4 = 0, c6 = 2533n,  = 2433n2 and complex multiplication
by zz[ 1+3
]; the second family has j = 2633, c4 = 233n, c6 = 0,  = 26n3 and complex
multiplication by zz[1]. nevertheless, if we consider two curves for n1, n2 then, if n1/n2

2

is not a sixth power in the rst example or a fourth power in the second example, the

curves are inequivalent over q and only become equivalent over extensions of degree 6 and

4, respectively. moreover, the minimal discriminants depend on the choice of n.
less
trivial examples of inequivalent weierstrass models (with j 6= 0, 1728) can be gleaned from
[24].

13

3.4. bounding the height

we now specialize silvermans formula further and put a bound on the height so that

we can test the height conjecture.

in order to specialize silvermans formula, we note that the values of the j-function

at the dierent heegner points k dene the distinct embeddings of bkd  c, so we may

rewrite silvermans formula for the height of (3.21) as

the sum in (3.23) is over representatives for the ideal class group. in general we will write:

hf ( )id :=

(3.24)

for any function f . for f ( ) = r( ) we denote r(d) := hr( )id. thus, for our special

ht(xd ; bkd) =

log|nbkd/q(de/bkd

h(d)

(cid:21).

the term r(d) in (3.25) only depends on  through the e7,7 invariant d = i4(). as
we have discussed above, the minimal discriminant can depend on the choice of heegner

point dening the curve (3.21), and even on the choice of bkd-isomorphism class for the

curve. we have, somewhat arbitrarily, chosen (3.10)(3.11) corresponding to the principal

class and moreover have chosen the weierstrass model (3.21).

now we can put some useful bounds on the height. the minimal discriminant is a

subtle object and is hard to estimate, even for a cm curve. for some cm curves its norm

can be as small as 1 (over f = q(j) under certain conditions on d  see [25]). in [26]it

is calculated for an interesting family of elliptic curves. it is quite possible that further

results for the model (3.21) can be obtained from the deep work of gross and zagier [27].

nevertheless, while it is subtle, we do know that in the model (3.21) it is a certain integral

ideal in bkd which divides the principal ideal () explicitly calculated in (3.21). from this

14

4. summary of some analytic number theory

in sections 4.1 and 4.2 we summarize some well-known facts and denitions from

analytic number theory. in section 4.3 we summarize some more technical facts needed in

section 5.

4.1. l-functions

denition 4.1: legendre-jacobi-kronecker symbol.

this is the unique, real,

completely multiplicative in both arguments:

n(cid:1).
nontrivial dirichlet character of modulus d. its value for n is denoted(cid:0) d

n(cid:1) can be computed for d, n 6= 0 as follows. first of all, it is
the ljk symbol (cid:0) d
(cid:0) d1d2
n (cid:1) =(cid:0) d1

(cid:0) d
n1n2(cid:1) =(cid:0) d

n1(cid:1)(cid:0) d
n2(cid:1)

n (cid:1)(cid:0) d2
n (cid:1)

(4.1)

thus it suces to give its value for n = 1 and for n prime:

1. if n = 1 then

1(cid:1) = +1
(cid:0) d

= 1
15

d  0
d < 0.

(4.2)

2. if n = 2 then

2(cid:1) = 0
(cid:0) d
= (1)(d21)/8
3. finally, if n = p is an odd prime then(cid:0) d

d even

d odd.

p(cid:1) is the legendre symbol, i.e.

if

d = 0 mod p

(cid:0) d
p(cid:1) = 0

(4.3)

(4.4)

if

= +1

d = x2mod p, for some x 6= 0
d 6= x2mod p, for any x
one can check that if d = 0, 1mod 4, (as in this paper), (cid:0) d

= 1

if

n(cid:1) only depends on the

residue class n mod |d|.

denition 4.2: fundamental discriminants d < 0 is called a fundamental dis-
criminant if it is the product of relatively prime factors of the form 4, 8, 8, or
(1)(p1)/2p, p  3.

equivalently, d < 0 satises either (a.) d = 1 mod 4 and d is squarefree, or (b.)
d = 0 mod 4 , d/4 6= 1 mod 4, and d/4 is squarefree. these are the discriminants of
quadratic imaginary elds.

denition 4.3: l-functions l-functions of conductor d are by denition the innite

series

l(s, d) :=

xn=1(cid:0) d

n(cid:1)ns.

(4.5)

for example, choosing d = 1 we get the riemann  function. other examples of

l(s, d) are:

l(s,3) =

l(s,4) =

l(s,7) =

+

xn=0(cid:18)
xn=0(cid:18)
xn=0(cid:18)

the analytic properties of l(s, d) are well known [29]. the series is absolutely con-

vergent for re(s) > 1 and admits an analytic continuation as an entire function of s (for
d 6= 1). moreover, for d < 0 we may dene

(s, d) := (q/)(s+1)/2((s + 1)/2)l(s, d).

(4.7)

in general it is a positive integer dividing d, but in our case where d is a fundamental

here q is a positive integer dened to be the minimal period in n of the function (cid:0) d
n(cid:1).
n(cid:1) is primitive with period |d|
discriminant, we have q = |d|. that is, the character (cid:0) d

exactly when d is a fundamental discriminant.

it can be shown that (s, d) is an entire function of complex order one. moreover the

zeroes of (s, d) come in complex conjugate pairs. thus (s, d) has a product formula 8

(s, d) = eay (cid:0)1 

s

(cid:1).

the completed function (s, d) has the functional equation

(s, d) = (1  s, d),

(4.8)

(4.9)

which is valid only for primitive characters (q = |d|). otherwise one must make a mod-
ication to account for prime factors of |d|/q. the zeroes , called the critical zeroes of
l(s, d), lie in the critical strip 0  re(s)  1.

it is known that s = 1 is not a zero for any d, and in fact

l(1, d) =

2h(d)

w(d)|d|1/2 .

(4.10)

(we will recall a proof of this below.) here w(d) is the order of the group of units in kd;
for d < 4 we have w(d) = 2.

8 this notation is a little sloppy because one should include a convergence factor for the innite

product. alternatively, one can eliminate this by grouping the factors with  6= 0 into complex-

conjugate pairs (since the coecients of the dirichlet series are real.)

17

4.2. the zeroes of l(s, d)

the ljk symbol is completely multiplicative as a function of n. combining this with

the prime factorization of integers one can write another product formula

l(s, d) = yp prime(cid:18)1 (cid:0) d

p(cid:1)ps(cid:19)1

(4.11)

for the function l(s, d). this is analogous to eulers product formula for (s). while it is

not immediately obvious, the product formula (4.11) for l(s, d) encodes the structure of

primes in the eld kd. thus, comparing the two product formulae (4.8) and (4.11) gives

information about primes. accordingly, the nature of the zeroes of l(s, d) are of interest

in understanding the arithmetic of kd.

this astute remark leads to the central problem of analytic number theory, the gen-

eralized riemann hypothesis. it is generalized because we are considering the family of

functions l(s, d); henceforth we use the abbreviation grh. 9 a formulation of the grh,

suitable for our present purposes, is the conjecture that the critical zeros of l(s, d) all

lie on the line re(s) = 1

2 . the grh is of course very dicult, so various sub-problems
have been studied. one of these concerns the possible existence of critical zeroes near

s = 1. these are known as landau-siegel zeroes (lszs). their existence would falsify

the grh. more precisely:

denition 4.4: landau-siegel zeroes. choose a constant c > 0. a landau-siegel

zero for c, d is a real zero s =  of l(s, d) with

1 

c

log |d|

<  < 1.

(4.12)

see [29] (chapter 21) for equivalent formulations of the landau-siegel zero.

it is possible to explicitly compute an eective constant c2 > 0 such that the neigh-
borhood of radius c2/ log|d| about the point s = 1 contains at most one zero of l(s, d).
this rules out complex zeroes in this neighborhood since they come in conjugate pairs.

9 in this paper grh always stands for the hypothesis for dirichlet l-functions, not for elliptic

curve l-functions.

18

however, the important challenge remains to eliminate the real zeroes. that is, to nd an

eective constant c1 such that there are no landau-siegel zeroes for c1 and any d, whether

positive or negative. in this paper we only study d < 0.

4.3. the large |d| behavior of l(1, d) and the zeroes of l(s, d)

in this section we explain how the zeroes of l(s, d) are related to the large |d|

behavior of

(d) :=

l(1, d)
l(1, d)

,

(4.13)

where the derivative is with respect to s. we will begin with some heuristic remarks, and

conclude with some precise estimates (theorems 4.1 and 4.2). these estimates will be

useful in the next section.

the relation between the size or rate of growth of (d) as |d|   and the

existence of zeroes near s = 1 follows from the key identity




(s, d) =

1
2

log(|d|/) +

1
2

((s + 1)/2) +

l
l

(s, d) = x|(,d)=0

1
s  

.

here

(x) :=

(x)
(x)

(4.14)

(4.15)

is the digamma function. equation (4.14) follows immediately from logarithmic dieren-

tiation in s of the product formula (4.8).

it follows from (4.14) that l

l (1, d) can grow rapidly with |d| if l(s, d) has some
zero  which is close (as a function of |d|) to the point s = 1. on the other hand,
zeroes further away from s = 1 have less of an impact on the sum in (4.14); their eect is

governed by their density of states. it is only the lower-lying zeroes which are important

for the size of (d). therefore, if we can say (d) is small then we will have checked a

prediction of the grh, at least in some neighborhood of s = 1. the smaller the bound on

(d) the larger the zero-free region around s = 1.

we will now explain a trivial bound on the growth of (d) obtained from bounding

the numerator and denominator separately. our argument is sloppy and far from optimal,

19

yet it does explain in simple terms the overall reason why the landau-siegel zero is related

to a small value of l(1, d).

we rst bound the numerator by showing there is a constant c such that

|l(1, d)|  c(log |d|)2.

(4.16)

we prove this as follows. by (4.5)

l(1, d) = 

(

d
n

|d|xn=1

)(log n)n1 

xn=|d|+1

(

d
n

)(log n)n1.

(4.17)

the rst sum is trivially

o(

|d|xn=1

(log n)n1) = o((log|d|)2).

(4.18)

log n

n

the second sum can easily be bounded by o((log|d|)2) using partial summation, since

changes slowly and

(

d
n

k+dxn=k

) = 0, k = 1, 2, 3, . . .

(4.19)

(roughly speaking, this means there is a lot of cancellation due to the oscillation of the

dirichlet character which modulates (log n)n1.)

the bound l(1, d) = o((log|d|)2) can be improved. nevertheless, the intuition is
that the fraction (d) can be extremely large only if its denominator is extremely small.

therefore we now bound the denominator. a trivial bound comes from (4.10). since
h(d)  1 it follows that

.

(4.20)

1

l(1, d)

= p|d|
h(d)  p|d|



of course, h(d) does grow with d so this estimate is far from optimal! 10

10 note that if h(d)/|d|1/2 is large there cannot be a zero near s = 1, while if h(d)/|d|1/2
is small there might be a nearby zero. this is the essence of the connection to the class number

problem. indeed, the work of goldfeld and gross-zagier provides better bounds on 1/l(1, d),

reverses the logic of the present discussion, and proves a growth rate of h(d) for |d| increasing.

this provides a solution to gauss problem of nding which imaginary quadratic elds have a

given xed class number.

20

taken together, (4.16) and (4.20) already show that

|(d)|  c(log|d|)2p|d|.

(4.21)

from (4.14), the inequality (4.21) rules out zeroes at (roughly) a distance of order

(log|d|)2|d|1/2

from s = 1. of course, the sizes of l(1, d) and l(1, d) are related to each other (by
integration of l(s, d) in s), but it is surprisingly dicult to improve on |d|1/2-factor in
the trivial bound (4.21).

let us now see what the grh has to say about the growth of (d). first of all,
littlewood proved that the grh implies 1/l(1, d) = o(log log|d|) as d   [30].
moreover, he showed that the grh implies

|(d)| = o(log log |d|),

and hence, in particular, that the grh forces

lim

d

(d)
log |d|

= 0.

(4.22)

(4.23)

in fact, one may produce sequences of ds such that (d) grows roughly as log log |d|.
all of this is evident from the following

theorem 4.1 [miller  in the appendix to this paper, [31]]. then

lim sup
d

lim inf

(d)

2

(4.24)

where (d) = l(1, d)/l(1, d). these inequalities hold, in fact, if d   along
fundamental discriminants.

of course, the grh might actually be false! evidently, there is a good deal of room

between the trivial bound (4.21) and the consequence (4.23) of the grh. the elimination of

landau-siegel zeroes is thought to constitute an important beachhead on the way towards

21

understanding the grh. the following theorem gives a criterion to rule out the existence

of landau-siegel zeroes:

theorem 4.2 suppose dn is a sequence of fundamental discriminants with dn  .
suppose furthermore that the limit

 := limdn

(dn)
log|dn|

is nite. then there exists a positive constant c,

c =(cid:18) 1

2

+ sup |(dn)|

log|dn|(cid:19)1

such that there are no landau-siegel zeroes for c among the dn.

(4.25)

(4.26)

proof: note that the zeroes  are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. writing

 =  + i for the real and imaginary parts we have:

x

1
1  

=x

1  

(1  )2 + 2

(4.27)

and since the zeroes are in the critical strip, this is a sum of nonnegative terms. thus, if

 =  is a real zero of l(s, d) then

(4.28)

where in the second line we have used (4.14). recall that (x) is the digamma function

(4.15).

since (4.27) is positive and the constant  1

2 log  + 1

2 (1) = 0.86 is negative it

follows from (4.28) that

now comparing with the denition (4.12) we see there is never a landau-siegel zero for

2 + sup |(dn)|

an alternative formulation of this proof (which has the advantage of naming the

constant c at the sacrice of ignoring a nite number of cases) is to use the literal denition

of the lim sup: for each  > 0 one can nd an n () such that

for all n  n (). then

those discrimiants dn   satisfy

2. the issue of eectiveness enters in the following ways.

in the rst argument, one

might know  exactly but not know what sup |(dn)|
log |dn|

is  we may know the limiting

behavior of this sequence but not be able to bound how long it takes for this sequence

to exhibit it. in the second argument, we may not be able to compute n () eectively.

5. black hole entropy and critical zeroes

in this section we will explore come consequences for analytic number theory of the

various conjectures of sections 2 and 3.

23

the main technical observation is that the height conjectures have implications for the

behavior of l(s, d) thanks to an equation sometimes called the chowla-selberg formula

[32]. this is a consequence of class eld theory and the kronecker limit formula. we next

recall the derivation of this formula.

the derivation begins with the the nonholomorphic eisenstein series

e(, s) :=

xn,m

ys

|m + n|2s

(5.1)

where y =  and the sum is over all pairs of integers (n, m) 6= (0, 0). the sum is absolutely
convergent for re(s) > 1, and admits a meromorphic continuation to the entire s-plane.

the (rst) kronecker limit formula is the statement (see, e.g., [33], p. 273)

e(, s) =



s  1  2 log(cid:20)2ey1/2|( )|2(cid:21) + o(s  1)

(5.2)

as s  1. now, let k be a set of representatives of the h(d) heegner points as in section
3. a simple application of class eld theory shows that

4 (cid:1)s/2
w(d)(cid:0)|d|

(s)l(s, d) =

h(d)xi=1

e(i, s).

(5.3)

we now take s  1 and compare the two sides of the equation. equating the residue of
the pole leads to the standard result (4.10). comparing the constant terms leads to the

chowla-selberg formula

r(d) = 12(cid:20)logd + (d) + log(cid:2)82e(cid:3)(cid:21)

where r(d) is dened by (3.23)(3.24).

(5.4)

we are now ready to combine the conjectures of sections two and three with the

results from section four. the rst point to make is that the ssv and sh conjectures
are probably incompatible. let dn   be a sequence of fundamental discriminants.
applying the ssv and sh conjectures to the family of attractors xdn constructed in
sections 3.2 and 3.3 we nd

ht(xdn , bkdn) =  log[pdn] + o(

24

log[dn]
|dn|1/2

,

1

|dn|/4 ).

fig. 1: a plot of (d) against |d|, as d runs through the negative prime funda-
mental discriminants with |d| < 2000. unfortunately log log |d| grows too slowly
to see numerically the envelope predicted by theorem 4.1.

this implies some very interesting cancellation in (3.25) for the following reason. roughly

speaking, theorem 4.1 says that there exist real numbers  with  < 0 < +, such
that (d) can actually grow like  log(log|d|) for some sequence of ds [31]. by (5.4)
this means that r(d) has scatter as illustrated in g. 1. for large |d| the envelope is of
width (+  ) log(log|d|). suppose, for the moment, that the minimal discriminant
term in (3.25) were absent. then using the sh conjecture we would conclude that  = 3/2

and moreover, by choosing suitable sequences of discriminants dn, the charges dn would
produce black holes with entropies smicro(dn) that actually grow with |dn| like

smicro(dn)  p|dn|(log|dn|)c

(5.6)

for various constants c in the range   c  +. moreover, theorem 4.1 asserts that
there exist sequences {dn} which actually realize the extreme cases .

now let us restore the minimal discriminant term

log|nbkd/q(de /bkd

h(d)

)|

(5.7)

in (3.25). as we have discussed, this depends on the choice of heegner point and the weier-

strass model. it would be fascinating (though we think unlikely) if for general sequences
of charges dn with dn   one could systematically choose weierstrass models such
that the minimal discriminant in (3.25) uctuates to match the changes in (dn) in the

25

way demanded by the ssv conjecture. since we think it is highly unlikely, we conclude

that ssv, and sh are probably incompatible, as stated above. we could be more precise

if we had better information on the size of the minimal discriminant de /bkd

put dierently, if one could choose families of attractor points with a bounded value

of (5.7) then the strong height conjecture implies that the distribution of

.

log dimh()

pi4()

(5.8)

plotted againstpi4() would have a lot of scatter, similar to the scatter in g. 1, around

the average value 1.

let us now assume wsv and w h (or wh). then, from (2.8)(3.2) and the rst

inequality in (3.26) we get

then, from the chowla-selberg formula we get

lim

r(dn)

log |dn|1/2  8.

lim

(dn)

(5.9)

(5.10)

now, using theorem 4.2 we arrive at the main statement in this paper: the wsv conjec-

ture and wh conjecture together rule out landau-siegel zeroes for d < 0. more precisely,

we have

theorem 5.1 the wsv conjecture and the w h conjecture together imply the following
restrictions on landau-siegel zeroes: for any sequence {dn} of fundamental discriminants
with dn  , there exists a positive constant c such that there are no landau-seigel
zeroes for (c, dn).

we would like to remark that a similar result (with log|d| replaced by |d|, for a
positive constant ) was proven unconditionally by tatuzawa in [34]. tatuzawas theorem,

while weaker, is sucient for many applications. two novelties of the present discussion
are that we have log|d| rather than a power, and, moreover, the constant c is in principle
computable from physics (granted the wsv and w h conjectures).

26

let us now turn the logic around and suppose that the correct conguration of con-

jectures is wsv, wh, but that there are landau-siegel zeroes for d < 0 (thus falsifying

the grh). then there would be sequences of charges n with d-brane congurations of

anomalously large entropy compared to the bekenstein-hawking entropy.

even more ambitiously, we can turn things around and assume the safest set of

conjectures: grh, wsv, and wh, and see what they predict. from the grh we have:

lim
n

r(dn)

log|dn|1/2 = 12

(5.11)

now, the wsv and the w h conjecture imply information on the mysterious minimal

discriminants of the elliptic curves (3.21). from (3.26) we get

lim
n

log|nbkdn /q(den /bkdn

h(dn) log(|dn|1/2)

)|

= 8  12,

(5.12)

and in particular,   3/2. note that the second inequality in (3.26) shows that   9. the
second inequality depends on the choice of weierstrass model (3.21), so we are assuming

our choice of models is suitable for the conjecture. of course, replacing w h by w h we

replace  by  and lim with lim and get a stronger prediction.

curiously, some examples support (5.12). as we mentioned before, the mini-

mal discriminant was computed in [26] for a certain family of curves over bkd=p for
p = 3 mod 4, and prime. denoting these curves by a(p), theorem 12.2.1 of [26] shows
= (p3), so the norm over q is (p3)2h and we thus get  = 3 for this
that da(p)/bkd=p

such a family would have  = 3/2.

6. conclusion

the remarks of section ve are built on a house of cards, namely, on a chain of con-

jectures about some relations between d-branes, black holes, and number theory. the

weakest link by far in the chain of conjectures is the relation between d-branes and arith-

metic suggested in [1]. admittedly, it is a long shot. nevertheless, as we have shown,

it would have dramatic consequences if true. at worst, there are a couple of interesting

27

coincidences, so perhaps it deserves some closer scrutiny. it is curious that the choice of

arithmetic model has some relevance for predictions such as (5.12). whether this turns

out to be an interesting feature or a fatal aw of our discussion remains to be seen.

appendix a. : large values of l

l (1, p), by stephen d. miller

in the above paper we made use of the fact that the generalized riemann hypothesis

(grh) implies that

where

(d) = o(log log|d|),

(d) =

l(1, d)
l(1, d)

.

also, we discussed the implications of how the log log|d| rate is in fact optimal. the
upper bound is well-known; a proof can be found in [35], for example. the purpose of this

appendix is to prove the lower bound:

theorem a(=4.1 above) let (d) = l(1,d)

l(1,d) and d = p. as p   among the

primes which are 3 modulo 4,

lim sup

(d)

log log|d| 

1

28

and

lim inf

(d)

log log |d|

2

.

the constant 1

2 is far from optimal; any non-zero constant will do for the application
in section 5 above. we remark that the discriminants d = p are a very special kind; for
one thing, they are fundamental discriminants. therefore, the conclusion of the theorem
still holds if we weaken our conditions on d, e.g. if it passes to  over all discriminants.
one can prove this theorem under the assumption of grh by modifying the technique

of littlewood ([30]), who was the rst to prove the analogous result for l(1, d). we will

present a dierent proof here based on the methods of [36] and [37], which has the advantage

that it is unconditional and that it allows us to infer the theorem over a set as sparse as

the primes. shorter proofs are possible, but we present the one here because all of the

background material is contained in the standard reference [29]. extremal theorems of

this type are proved in two steps: rst one truncates the dirichlet series denition for each

individual l(s, d), and then averages the remaining nite sum over many d to show the

theorem in the mean. since one term must always meet the size of the average, we conclude

that there are large individual values. we will use sieve methods for each of these steps.

a.1. character sums

the material in this section is modied from [37], chapter 22.

lemma 1 [lemma 22.4 of [37]] let 1, . . . , j be distinct primitive characters to moduli
 q, and let an be arbitrary complex numbers. then

we will use lemma 1 to make a series of estimates. the exponents we use are

somewhat arbitrary and are hardly optimal.

we will require a form of dirichlets theorem on the distribution of primes in residue

classes. to x notation we will set li(x) to be the logarithmic integral

and

(x, k, l) = #{p  x|p prime, p  l (mod k)}.

(related to the landau-siegel zero):

theorem p let q be a positive integer. then there exists a constant b > 0 such that
for any modulus k  q  except for perhaps one exceptional modulus k1 and its multiples
 we have

(x, k, l) =

(k, l) = 1

33

for x  exp (log q)2  q  exp(log x). the possible exception k1 grows to innity with

q.

recall the formula that

l(1, )

the next proposition shows that one can truncate the sum.

proposition 5 for q large and (log q)20  y  q2, all but o(q11/12) distinct primitive
characters  to moduli  q have

given y between (log q)20 and q2, we shall dyadically decompose the range from
(y, exp q1/8] into intervals (uk, 2uk], uk = 2ky  exp q1/8. among these o(q1/8) ranges
we will distinguish those that come before and after the range containing q2, designated

as (uk0 , 2uk0 ].

a.2. constructing a set of discriminants

having proven proposition 5, we have now established that if d is a fundamental

discriminant, then

= xp(log |d|)20(cid:18) d

+ o(1)

except for d in a very sparse set.
in fact, we may usually invoke this conclusion for
fundamental discrimants of the form d = p, p a prime with p  3 (4). we shall
now present a set of candidates for extreme values of l(1, d). while we will not be able

to directly show that they are large, we will prove an average result which allows us to

conclude that at least one of them is.

the candidates: we will pattern ourselves after the argument in [36]. let x be a

large parameter and set

log x

(log log x)2 .

y =

enumerate the odd primes p2, p3, . . . , pm  y and form the product

m = 8p2p3    pm = 4 exp(xpy

log p) = exp(y + o(y)).

not all of the moduli

m
pm

, . . . ,

m
p1

are divisible by the exceptional modulis k1 mentioned in theorem p (applied to x). let
k = m
pr

be the rst of these listed above (i.e. with r the largest) which is not divisible by

k1; if none exists, then set r = m. the purpose of this construction is to guarantee that

(x, k, l) =

li(x)
(k)

+ o(x exp(bplog x))

35

for l relatively prime to k. using the chinese remainder theorem, we can nd two special

residues l mod k such that

dene the sets

(cid:18) l
p(cid:19) = 1 , pr 6= p  y.

s = {q |x  q  x, q prime, q  l (mod k), (q, k1) = 1}  e,

where e is the exceptional set of proposition 5. it follows that the cardinality of s is
s = li(x)

(k) + o(x expblog x)). for any d  s,

(a.3)

in the next section, we will show that this sum is o(1) on average.

a.3. sifting and averaging

following [36], we will use a version of the renyi sieve to average (a.3).

lemma r let z be a set of z = |z| integers in a range of n consecutive integers,
f (p)  p and q(p) > 1 otherwise-arbitrary functions, and set

inequality

lemma 6 ([36]) keeping the same notation as lemma r, assume p is a normal prime.

then the number of z  z in the irregular residue classes mod p is  z(cid:16) f (p)

we will always take f (p) = p/(log p)5 and q(p) = (log p)5.

pxh=1(cid:18) h

the sum over the normal primes p is thus

p(log p)4 = o(s).



lemma 8 the sum in (a.4) over the abnormal primes is also o(s).

proof of lemma 8: first, we demonstrate that there is at most one abnormal
prime p  exp(y log log x). this is because s(p, h) = #{d  s | d  h (p)}. by
theorem p applied to x and the moduli kp  exp(log x), there is at most one prime
p  exp(y log log x) which violates

s(p, h) =

s
p  1

+ o(x exp(bplog x)) =

s
p

+ o(

s

p2 ) + o(x exp(bplog x)).

this means p qualies as a normal prime, because x  s(k) log x.
by lemma r, the number of abnormal primes p  x is 2x(log x)15

s

we will bound the sum over the abnormal primes p individually as

= o((k)(log x)16).

proof of theorem a: lemmas 7 and 8 show that the average of (a.3) over s is

log log x + o(log log x).

at least one term must exceed this average, proving theorem a.
