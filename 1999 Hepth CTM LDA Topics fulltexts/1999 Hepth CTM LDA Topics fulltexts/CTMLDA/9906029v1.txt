1 introduction

several past years brought us new understanding of non-perturbative phenomena in supersymmetric (susy)
quantum gauge theories. in particular it has become possible to take into account all instanton eects and
write down the exact low-energy eective actions in n = 2 susy yang-mills theories [1, 2]. the proposed
non-perturbative formulas imply an existence of underlying hidden geometric structures and, in a most elegant
way, can be formulated in terms of integrable systems [3]. this question has already a long story, but the
origin of this relation still remains to be an open problem. the aim of these notes is, in particular, to discuss
and partially ll this gap. we shall see, for example, that some aspects of this relation can be more clearly
understood if one takes, rst, susy gauge theory in the space-time with compactied dimensions [4].

the reason is that the compactied gauge theory has larger moduli space than its fully non-compact relative
[4], and this moduli space can be thought of as a phase space of certain classical integrable system. we shall
consider the compactied theory with broken susy by the scherk-schwarz mechanism (down to n = 1 in
4d sense), i.e. when the breaking mass parameter is given by 
r , where r is the radius of compact dimension
and   phase parameter of boundary conditions. in the decompactication limit r   supersymmetry is
restored but the extra, compact, degrees of freedom become heavy and the integration over them leads to
the averaging of an integrable system in the bogolyubov-whitham sense  thus becoming an origin of the
relation between seiberg-witten theories and whitham integrable systems [3].

2 integrable systems in seiberg-witten theory

we start with the formulation of the exact eective actions for the 4d susy gauge theories a la seiberg and
witten (sw) [1, 2] which is very simple: the (coulomb branch) low-energy eective action for the n = 2
susy yang-mills vector multiplets (supersymmetry requires the metric on moduli space of massless complex
scalars from n = 2 vector supermultiplets to be of a special kahler form  or the kahler potential k(a, a) =
impi ai
should be expressed through a holomorphic function f = f (a)  a prepotential) can be described
in terms of auxiliary riemann surface (complex curve) , endowed with a meromorphic 1-dierential ds, which
possess peculiar properties:

fai

 the number of live moduli (of complex structure) of  is strongly restricted (roughly 3 times less
than for generic riemann surface). the genus of   for the su (n ) gauge theories  is exactly equal to
the rank of gauge group  i.e. to the number of independent moduli.

 the variation of generating 1-form ds over these moduli gives holomorphic dierentials

 all above requirements can be summarized saying that the sw data are equivalent to dening an integrable
system [3] in the sense of [5]. the periods (2) are the action variables and the (holomorphic) variation of the
generating 1-form (1) gives rise to the dual (angle) variables. the corresponding class of integrable models
include well-known integrable systems of particles (the periodic toda chains, calogero-moser models and
their relativistic ruijsenaars generalizations) and classical spin chains (see [6, 7] and references therein for
details).

the prepotential f itself has no natural denition in the language of classical nite-gap integrable systems
[5]  in order to describe it one has to consider deformations of the nite-gap models. it is possible to
show, for example, that it satises the following system of dierential equations [8]

where g = pk gkfk for any gk. the system of equations (5) holds non-perturbatively for most of sw
prepotentials (an important exception is the case of broken n = 4 theory  the elliptic calogero-moser
model [9]). the proof of the eqs. (5), (7) is based on the existence of closed algebra of multiplication of
holomorphic dierentials on certain riemann surfaces [8, 9], which is a sort of generalization of polynomial
rings.

 the sw prepotential f can be also considered as a particular case of the tau-function of the whitham

hierarchy [10]  a function of innitely many extra parameters tn so that in the sw point

it implies, in particular, that the generalized prepotential satises [11]

is the prepotential of generalized kontsevich model [12]  a 2d topological string theory or the local
part which is not related to the structure of nontrivial sw spectral curve, while the r.h.s. of (12) is
expressed through the derivatives of -constant, corresponding to a particular sw curve (and certain
choice of characteristic on this particular curve).

 eqs. (5), (7), (9) and (12) are classical dierential equations one can write for the quantum eective actions
which, in particular, depend on the planck constant h or the string scale . the same phenomenon was
studied earlier in the case of 2d topological string models (see, for example [13] and references therein).

these properties of the low-energy eective susy gauge theories follow from the seiberg-witten hypothesis
and were derived using calculus on riemann surfases. however they do not tell us anything about the origin
of this non-perturbative structure. in particular the physical sense of arising integrable system remains to be
unclear. one of the ways to try to understand it is to consider the compactied version of the sw theory.

there were two, at rst glance dierent, consequences of adding a compact dimension in the context of
seiberg and witten. a straightforward one is to add 5-th compact dimension to 4d susy gauge theory and to
take into account the contribution of the soft kaluza-klein (kk) modes [14] which leads to the relativization
of an integrable system. a dierent eect of enlarging moduli space arises when one considers (preserving
susy!) compactication down to 3+1 (compact) dimension [4]. both ways are particular cases of generic
compactied theory with wilson lines, or new moduli  the monodromies of gauge elds and, in general, such
compactication breaks supersymmetry (at least partially), giving rise, in particular, to new eective theories
of sw type [15, 16, 17].

in order to discuss compactied theory, we shall consider, rst, general properties of moduli spaces (vacua)
of susy yang-mills, or, if speaking about bosonic sector, the so called yang-mills-higgs theories. on these
moduli spaces one can introduce holomorphic symplectic 2-forms which allow to construct an integrable system
in the sense of [5] or [24]. the integrating change of variables can be considered as relation between bare or
classical and quantum variables in the context of corresponding gauge theory. partially this relation is known
as a relation between bare moduli uk = 1
k trk and the exact quantum moduli  the periods of seiberg-
witten dierential or action variables in corresponding integrable system. the rest part of this relation  exactly
the integrating change of variables in nite-gap integrable system has also the meaning of relation between the
bare wilson loops (or dual moduli) and their exact quantum counterparts. we shall also discuss the symmetry
between wilson loops and scalar moduli under t-duality transformation and show that it is related with the
duality between the co-ordinates and action variables in integrable systems [25, 26].

as a particular example of compactied theory we shall consider 3+1 dimensional vector supermultiplet
with wilson line softly breaking susy from n = 2 in 4d sense down to n = 2 in 3 dimensions (from two
complex weyl spinor supercharges to one complex or two real weyl supercharges). this, macroscopically 3-
dimensional theory is known to generate toda chain superpotential [27, 28, 29] and we shall demonstrate that
this superpotential is directly related to the toda chain dynamics arising in the context of sw theory.

3 perturbative gauge theories and degenerate integrable systems

the relation between sw theories and integrable systems can be already discussed at the perturbative level [17],
where n = 2 susy eective actions are completely dened by the 1-loop contributions (see [1] and references
therein). the scalar eld  = kijk of n = 2 vector supermultiplet acquires nonzero vev  = diag(1, . . . , n )
and the masses of particles  w -bosons and their superpartners are proportional to ij = i  j due to the

3

higgs term [a, ]ij = aij
terms of the generating polynomial

 (i  j ) in the susy yang-mills action. these masses can be written altogether in

w = pn () = det(  ) =y(  i)
where  is the adjoint complex scalar (tr =pi i = 0), via residue formula

mij icij

d log w =icij

d log pn ()

(14)

(15)

which for a particular -like contour cij around the roots  = i and  = j gives rise exactly to the higgs
masses. the contour integral (15) is dened on a complex -plane with n removed points: the roots of the
polynomial (14)  a degenerate riemann surface. the masses of monopoles are naively innite in this limit,
since the corresponding contours (dual to cij ) start and end in the points where ds obeys pole singularities. it
means that the monopole masses, proportional to the squared inverse coupling, are renormalized in perturbation
theory and dened naively up to the masses of particle states times some divergent constants.

the eective action (the prepotential) f , or the set of eective charges tij (4), are dened in n = 2

perturbation theory completely by 1-loop diagram giving rise to the logarithmic corrections

(cid:0)2f(cid:1)ij = tij  xmasses

(mass)2

2 = log

(i  j )2

(16)

where   qcd and last equality is true only for pure gauge theories  since the only masses we have there
are given by (15). that is all one has in the perturbative weak-coupling limit of the sw construction, when
the instanton contributions to the prepotential (being proportional to the degrees of 2n (or q2n  e2i n 
in the uv-nite theories with bare coupling  ) are (exponentially) suppressed so that one keeps only the terms
proportional to  or log . these degenerated rational spectral curves can be already related to the family of
trigonometric ruijsenaars-schneider and calogero-moser-sutherland systems and the open toda chain or toda
molecule.

for example, in the case of su (2) pure gauge theory eq. (14) turns into

w = 2  u

(17)

with u = 1
written as

2 tr2. in the parameterization of [1] x = w = ez = 2  u, y = w the same equation can be
(18)

y 2 = x 2(x + u)

and the masses (15) are now dened by the contour integrals of

ds = d log w = 2

(19)

one can easily notice that eqs. (17), (18) and (19) can be interpreted as integration of the open sl(2) (the
liouville) toda chain with the co-ordinate x = w = eq, momentum p =  and hamiltonian (energy) u. the
integration of generating dierential ds = pdq over the trajectories of the particles gives rise, in fact, to the
monopole masses in the sw theory.

this is actually a general rule  the perturbative n = 2 theories of the sw family give rise to the open
or trigonometric family of integrable systems  the open toda chain, the trigonometric calogero-moser or
ruijsenaars-schneider systems. this can be easily established at the level of spectrum (15) and the eective
couplings (16)  the corresponding (rational) curves are (14) in the n -particle toda chain case

and contain in addition to the higgs part ij the kk modes n
r and the kk modes for the elds with shifted
by  boundary conditions. the  parameter can be treated as a wilson loop of gauge eld along the compact
dimension and in a subclass of models [18] 

r plays the role of the mass of the adjoint matter multiplet.

thus we see that the relation between eective actions of susy gauge theories and classical integrable
systems is really established on perturbative level. moreover, the perturbative limit can be considered as a self-
consistent approximation since all ingredients of the relation between the sw theories and integrable systems
we mentioned above can be consistently (and even explicitly), in particular:

 the associativity equations (5) possess an obvious class of perturbative solutions, for example (cf. with

(see a proof by straightforward calculation in [8]), which is a direct weak-coupling limit of the full sw
prepotential when the non-perturbative terms (powers of ) are suppressed. a generic approach to the
computation of perturbative prepotentials (including the theories with the kk excitations) based on sw
theory can be found in [19].

 whitham hierarchy has a particular class of solutions corresponding to degenerate riemann surfaces 
where handles turn into (pairs of) points and holomorphic dierentials into the dierentials with rst-order
poles at these points. the generating dierential in this case has general structure

ds =x tnn1d +x ai

(24)

this formula provides a straightforward way of computation of the perturbative whitham tau-function
with non-zero times tn

1.

despite one can really check in the perturbative limit all the statements of sect. 2 by standard eld theory

computation, the nature of this relation at such level remains unclear.

4 string theory and yang-mills-higgs system

in general, moduli spaces of susy gauge theories are described in terms of the (eigenvalues of the) scalar elds
from susy multiplets and  in general situation when space-time has compact dimensions  one should also
add the wilson loops of gauge elds themselves. the scalar higgs elds in string picture are associated with
the positions of branes (the hypersurfaces) in some transverse directions and the eective world-volume gauge
theories are coming from open strings ending on d-branes. the quantum moduli spaces of branes are formulated
in terms of full matrices (rather than their eigenvalues) [20] with the potential 2

which arises in the action under the compactication of 10d n = 1 susy yang-mills theory

v () = trxi<j

[i, j]2

1however, it would be nice to have an explicit expression.
2moduli space can be also described in terms of holomorphic superpotential, for example, for 6 real elds

so that m = (, i), i.e. a = am for m = 0, . . . , 3 and i = am for m = 4, . . . , 9. in the vacuum sector one
can neglect the fermionic terms in (28) and, thus, speak about the yang-mills-higgs system. minima of the
potential (26) correspond to [i, j] = 0, or to the simultaneously diagonal matrices

i = diag ((i)

1 , . . . , (i)
n )

(29)

distinct eigenvalues correspond to u (1)n1 gauge theory, when the eigenvalues of i coincide the gauge sym-
metry is restored up to su (n ). in terms of modern string theory, the action (28) literally corresponds to a
system of n parallel d3-branes or to (bosonic sector of) n = 4 susy yang-mills theory. six scalars i can all
obey non-zero vevs so that the dimension of moduli space is 6(n  1). d3 branes can be thought of as d5
branes x0, . . . , x5 compactied on two-torus, if, say, the dimensions x4 and x5 are compact.

in theories with n = 4 susy in four dimensions eective couplings and bps masses are not renormalized 
the theory has lots of symmetries including conformal group and there are no dimensionful (mass) parameters.
it means, in particular that the eigenvalues of the scalar elds {i} are not renormalized, as well as {qi}  the
eigenvalues of the wilson loopsh adx  if we consider a theory with compact dimensions. the correspondence
between sw theories and integrable systems implies that theory with n = 4 susy corresponds to a system
of free particles  with the hamiltonians uk = 1
i , where {i} play the role of momenta. if one
adds compact dimensions, the extra moduli {qi} can play the role of dual co-ordinates  at least in the sense
that the volume of moduli space is (non-renormalized, dimensionless) constant and the volume form can be
presented as a degree of symplectic form

kpi k

k trk = 1

 = trz a   = di  dqi

breaking supersymmetry down to n = 2 the potential acquires extra mass terms m2
i for two of three
scalar elds and the dimension of scalar moduli space goes down to 2(n  1) or to one complex diagonal
matrix eld (29). moreover, in contrast to n = 4 theory, in general case (of nontrivial boundary conditions)
matrices of scalar elds and monodromies become dependent of each other, or satisfy nontrivial commutation
relation like

i tr2

(31)
linear in the parameter of massive deformation [18] (for m  0 one comes back to n = 4 theory) and j is
some matrix of gauge-covariant form.

are correct quantum variables  the seiberg-witten integrals. one may consider ai = ai(, ) as a transfor-
mation from bare quantities  the eigenvalues {i} to their exact quantum values in the eective theories {ai},
playing the role of the exact quantum bps masses. in the same way one should consider the transformation
qi  i as transformation from bare value of monodromy to its exact quantum value in the eective theory.

5 compactication to 3+1 dimensions and susy breaking

susy breaking can be elegantly reached compactifying theories with nontrivial boundary conditions (the scherk-
schwarz mechanism). in the framework of sw theory this leads to a possibility, for example, to formulate the
whole family of the adjoint matter sw theories as various limits of a unique integrable system  the elliptic
ruijsenaars-schneider model [15, 16].

consider now the compactication of n = 2 susy yang-mills theory with the only vector supermultiplet to
3+1 (compact with radius r3  r) dimensions. if one takes all elds to have the periodic boundary conditions
in compact direction this would be a n = 4 (in 3d sense) susy theory. if, however, one puts [15, 16]

(x + r) = ei(x)

(34)

6

on half of the elds, the resulting theory would have only n = 2 three-dimensional susy (i.e. n = 1 in 4d
sense), i.e. the supersymmetry will be (partially) broken by non-periodic boundary conditions.

as an example, let us consider the case of n = 2 4d vector supermultiplet in the adjoint representation,
consisting of (a, )  4d n = 1 vector multiplet and (, )  4d n = 1 scalar multiplet, where  and 
are two complex weyl spinors. let the latter one acquire a nontrivial phase (34) under shift along the loop
in compact direction, then it becomes massive with mass 
r . the 4d n = 1 vector multiplet remains to be
massless, and can be represented as a 3d n = 2 supermultiplet (a, , q
r ), where  = 0, 1, 2, q = ra3 and 
is 3d complex spinor.

in contrast to n = 4 susy in 3d, n = 2 supersymmetric theory can generate a superpotential [29].
introducing complexied variables qi  qj + ii where qi are the (properly normalized) eigenvalues of the
matrix h a3 and i are 3d dual photons ai = ijkjk, the superpotential acquires the form [4, 23]

where the rst term is 4d contribution [1], the second term (rst term in the brackets) has 3d origin and the
last one is induced by 3+1d instanton contributions (see, for example, recent paper [30] and references therein
for details). all simple roots (the rst term) are usual 3d instantons (bps monopoles) giving the potential
of the open toda chain, while the last term (the negative root) appears only in 3+1 dimensions and can be
treated as a 4d instanton (or caloron) contribution.

in the weak coupling limit this term vanishes, giving rise to the open toda chain [4]. this term also vanishes
in literally 3d gauge theory (when the compact dimension shrinks to zero), it is not surprising since dimensional
reduction implies that r

for   1, the whole instanton series e2q  e can be reduced to the classical or bare result. we see,
indeed, that quantization  at least in the sense of constructing the eective actions  has the form of canonical
transformation of some integrable system 3.

the opposite limit r   corresponds to the uncompactied 4d gauge theory and in this limit the 3d
variables {qi} or {i} are massive, i.e. cannot play the role of moduli. thus the dimension of moduli space
becomes equal to the half of the dimension of the phase space of an integrable system and computation of the
eective action requires also an integration over the 3d variables, or the bogolyubov-whitham averaging of
an integrable system. this leads to arising of the whitham integrable system, which can be formulated in pure
geometric terms along the lines of [10].

let us point out that the susy breaking we have considered above is dierent from a direct susy breaking
to n = 1 4d theory (without compactication) [1] which implies the massless monopoles limit of the n = 2
spectral curve n cosh z = pn () or, in particular, that the polynomial pn () (14) turns into

which can be easily solved. the conditions (50) can be interpreted as values of the scalar elds in the critical
points of the superpotential while the soliton trajectories connect the critical points.

another way to see that susy breaking down to n = 1 should correspond to the solitonic limit comes,
possibly, from more detailed study of the whitham hierarchy. generating superpotential in the n = 1 theory
can be thought of as switching on whitham dynamics tktrk in the sense of [11]. for small values of tk this
can be thought as perturbation of the smooth n = 2 solution, or to the computation of certain correlators in
n = 2 sym theory. n = 1 theory itself rather corresponds to nding the solutions to whitham equations for
large values of tk. the large tk asymptotic of the whitham solutions brings us to the boundaries of moduli
space or, in other words, corresponds to the decoupling of the smooth nite-gap solutions into solitons.

6 t-duality and dualities in integrable systems

t-duality is one of the basic features of string theory in target-space with compact dimensions and an example
of coordinate-momentum duality. it is well-known and, in fact, easy to see that the spectrum of string on a circle
of radius r is invariant under the transformation r  
r which interchanges the kk momenta, propagating
along the compact direction, with the windings of strings along the circle. t-duality transformation also replaces
the wilson of gauge elds loops by positions of branes or vevs of scalars and vice versa (see, for example, [21]
for details).

two dierent pictures of moduli space (of compactied theory)  in terms of wilson lines and vevs of
scalar elds are t-dual to each other. this coordinate-momentum duality can be trivially seen in the theory
with n = 4 susy when it literally corresponds to the exchange of independent parameters {i} and {qi}  the
momenta (action variables) and co-ordinates (angles) of a trivial integrable system  free motion of particles
on some torus. breaking n = 4 susy leads to relating of corresponding gauge theory with already nontrivial
integrable system, when the action variables are no longer identied with momenta. however, certain nite-
dimensional integrable systems (of the calogero-moser-ruijsenaars family) still possess nice duality properties
[25, 26], and it is not quite a coincidence that this duality can be easily constructed in the systems corresponding
to the theories with kk excitations [14, 16].

in other words t-duality can be considered as symmetry between the a and  variables in the relation (31).
in terms of integrable systems this leads to the symmetry between two dierent sets of commuting variables on
the full phase space  the original co-ordinates and hamiltonians (or action variables) of an integrable system
[25, 26].

as an example, consider, rst, 2-particle trigonometric ruijsenaars system with the hamiltonian

from the hamiltonian equations

(with a particular choice for the integration constant). it is easy to check that the symplectic form is

where h = cosh x,  = te = th2  1. moreover it is easy to see that, introducing h = cosh q, one gets from

eq. (57)

i.e. the hamiltonian of the dual system which is again the trigonometric ruijsennars model with the same
coupling constant m2.

this self-duality of trigonometric ruijsenaars system turns into duality between the trigonometric calogero-
moser model and rational relativistic ruijsenaars model in almost obvious nonrelativistic limit. the equation
of motion (56) can be equally considered as an equation of motion for the non-relativistic calogero-moser model
with the hamiltonian

hcm =

so that hcm = e = h2  1. the result of integration of the equation of motion is again (57) but now one

has to consider rather non-relativistic limit of small x and p, i.e. hcm = e = x2 but still cosh q = h. it
follows then, that the system (60) is dual to rational ruijsenaars model with the hamiltonian 5

h = cosh r1

(63)

in general n -particle trigonometric ruijsenaars-schneider system it was shown in [25] that the duality trans-
formation can be interpreted as modular transformation in the space of the sl(n ) valued at connections on
torus. these at connections are described by two sl(n ) matrices in general position, say, (a, b) modulo
common conjugation: (a, b) 7 (gag1, gbg1). according to [25], this space is endowed with the poisson
bracket

{a ,
{a ,
{b ,

a} = raa  a + a  ara + (1  a)r21(a  1)  (a  1)r12(1  a)

which is degenerate, but can be inverted, for example, on a symplectic leave, dened as

aba1b1 = m21 + r(1)

5 going further, it is easy to check that in the double non-relativistic limit one comes to the (again self-dual) rational calogero

model with

hc = p2

where r(1)     is a matrix of unit rank (or r(1)
). diagonalizing, for example, a = diag(q1, . . . , qn ) one can turn the relation (66) into

ij  ij with some, dependent on a and b, vectors  and

qj  m2(cid:19) bij = r(1)
(cid:18) qi

ij = i j

(67)

where  =   b. now, using the freedome of conjugation by diagonal matrices (which leaves the diagonal form
of a untouched) one can put (in general position) all j = 1, ending up with

the traces of this matrix, as functions of i = epi and qi = eqi give hamiltonians of the trigonometric
ruijsenaars-schneider system. in the nonrelativistic limit equation (66) turns into the commutator relation

bij =

with the solution

as we discussed in sect. 3 the trigonometric ruijsenaars-schneider system literally corresponds to the perturba-
tive limit of the sw theory with the adjoint mass and kk excitations (22), so this is the way how perturbative
t-duality transformation is realized on the phase space of corresponding integrable system.

7 conclusion

in these notes we have tried to review main ingredients of the approach based on relation of the seiberg-witten
eective theories with integrable systems. recent studies have shown that the existence of the exact non-
perturbative integrable dierential equations allows to compute explicitly some physical quantites in 4d susy
gauge theories.

moreover, it turns out that an integrable system in a most straightforward way is seen in the compactied
susy gauge theory  in 3 plus 1 compact dimensions. in this case, one nds that the symplectic transformation
is nothing but a change of variables from bare to exact quantum variables and the set of hamiltonians (or the
spectral curve equation) arises as superpotentials in the compactied theory with broken susy.

note added. in a very recent paper [31] one can nd very similiar conclusions concerning the relation
between superpotentials and structures of the integrable system we have discussed above. moreover, this paper
contains the detailed analysis of breaking susy down to n = 1 in the theory with nite adjoint mass  the
corresponding superpotential coincides, like it should follow from general reasoning and the results of [18], with
that of elliptic calogero-moser model.
