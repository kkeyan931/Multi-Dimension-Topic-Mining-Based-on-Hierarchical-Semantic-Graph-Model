abstract

applying the time-dependent variational principle of balian and veneroni, we
derive variational approximations for multi-time correlation functions in 4 eld

theory. we assume rst that the initial state is given and characterized by a density

operator equal to a gaussian density matrix. then, we study the more realistic

situation where only a few expectation values are given at the initial time and we

perform an optimization with respect to the initial state. we calculate explicitly

the two-time correlation functions with two and four eld operators at equilibrium

in the symmetric phase.

introduction

the description of the time evolution of a system with initial conditions which are out
of equilibrium is one of the main challenges in quantum eld theory at nite tempera-
ture. this problem appears in dierent contexts in cosmology or in particle physics. in
inationary models for the primordial universe, the problem is to describe the evolution
of the inaton scalar eld in order to be abble to predict the duration of the inationary
phase. another important problem is the prediction of the density uctuations and its
relation to the distribution of galaxies [1].
in particle physics, the experiments at the
brookhaven relativistic heavy ion collider (rhic) or soon at the cern large hadron
collider (lhc) may show a phase transition between a state where the quarks and the
gluons are deconned and chiral symmetry restored and the state of ordinary matter.
the state of the matter formed after the collision is out of equilibrium and the study of
the dynamics near the phase transition requires a nonperturbative method. the chiral
phase transition can be studied in a model of scalar elds with an o(n) symmetry. the
relaxation of inhomogeneous pions congurations formed during the collision (called dis-
oriented chiral condensates or dcc) could be the signal of the chiral phase transition
through a pions distribution with strong correlations [2].
in the standard model, one
is interested in the dynamical properties of the electroweak phase transition in order to
describe the baryogenesis. the violation of the baryonic number, which is related to the
desintegration of non-trivial topological eld congurations, the sphalerons, is evaluated
from a correlation function calculated at high temperature in a classical approximation
[3].

the scale for the energy density involved in the primordial universe or the length
scale which is important for the collective modes in quantum chromodynamics require
non-perturbative approaches. variational methods are therefore particularly adapted.

in the mean-eld hartree-fock (hf) approximation for fermions or the hartree-
bogoliubov (hb) approximation for bosons, one minimizes the free energy or, at zero
temperature, the energy with a gaussian variational ansatz for the density matrix or the
pure state. for a time-dependent problem, the corresponding approximations (tdhf or
tdhb) are obtained by minimizing an action also with a gaussian variational ansatz. (at
zero temperature, a time-dependent variational principle was already introduced by dirac
[4]. it was used by the authors of reference [5] in the context of quantum eld theories .)
these methods are well adapted to the calculation of expectation values. however, they
are not suitable for multi-time correlation functions. in order to obtain approximations for
these multi-time correlation functions, a variational principle was recently introduced in
the context of non-relativistic fermions [6]. the action to minimize has for stationary value
the generating functional for the correlation functions. this functional is a functional of

5

the time-dependent sources coupled to the operators of interest. the action involves
two types of variational objects, one a(t) related to the observables of interest and the
other d(t) akin to a density matrix. the temporal evolution of a(t) is described by a
backward equation while that of d(t) involves a time running forward. let us notice
that this doubling of the number of degrees of freedom with two temporal arrows appears
already in the formalism of schwinger and keldysh for time-dependent problems at nite
temperature [7]. (for a review of the dierent formalisms used at nite temperature,
see reference [8]). by restricting the variational spaces for a(t) and d(t) to gaussian
operators, one obtains evolution equations which are coupled. the expansion at rst
order in powers of the sources of these equations (or at the second order for the generating
functional ) provides approximations for the two-time correlation functions. in spite of
the gaussian character of the variational ansatze, the approximations obtained in this
way go beyond the usual mean-eld approximations and include correlations between
particles. this comes from the fact that the variational principle of balian and veneroni
[6] has been precisely constructed to provide directly the quantity of interest, namely the
generating functional.

our aim is to generalize this formalism to quantum eld theories. for simplicity,
we will consider the case of a scalar eld described by a 4 interaction in a minkowski
space. we will choose sources coupled to local operators such as (x) or (x) (written
here in the schrodinger representation) and to composite operators such as (x)(y) or
(x)(y). the second derivative of the generating functional with respect to the sources
will thus give two-time correlation functions which have up to four eld operators.

in the rst part of the paper, we will consider that the initial state is given and char-
acterized by a density operator d(t0) equal to a gaussian density matrix. we will write
the action functional to be minimized (eqs. (2.14) and (2.15)). then we will restrict our
variational spaces to operators which are exponentials of quadratic and linear forms in the
eld operators (x) and (x) (called gaussian operators). an adequate parametrization
of the variational objects allows us to write the coupled dynamical equations in a compact
form. we stress again the fact that the variational method we use introduces a doubling
of the degrees of freedom. we obtain four coupled equations (two for the expectation
values of one-eld operator and two for the expectation values of two-eld operators).
therefore we have twice as many dynamical equations as the usual mean-eld approach.
the expansion of these equations to lowest zero order in powers of the sources leads to a
decoupling of these equations whose a half is identical to the time-dependent mean-eld
equations for the 4 theory written in reference [9]. we have showed in a previous pa-
per that these dynamical equations can be put into a classical noncanonical hamiltonian
framework with a poisson structure which is a generalization of the standard poisson
bracket [10]. at the lowest order we thus obtain an approximation for the single-time

6

expectation values of one or two eld operators. the expansion of the coupled equations
to rst order in powers of the sources provides an approximation for the two-time cor-
relation functions with two, three or four eld operators. their evaluation proceeds in
the following way : rst one solves the mean-eld tdhb equations, then one calculates
the kernel which corresponds to small deviations arround the mean-eld solution (which
is analogous to the random phase approximation (rpa) kernel of reference [6]) and -
nally one solves a backward dynamical equation which involves the kernel calculated for
the mean-eld solution. these results have been obtained for the generating functional
of correlation functions with time-ordered product of the eld operators. we also give
the corresponding expressions for the retarded green functions. indeed, these retarded
green functions appear when one studies the response of the system to a small external
perturbation. a less complete version of this rst part of the paper has been published
in reference [11].

in section 2, we have supposed that the initial state d(t0) was known. in practice,
this is not the case. only the expectation values of a few observables are known. in section
3, we use the form of the variational principle introduced by balian and veneroni which
optimizes also the initial state [6]. the approximations obtained in this way for the two-
time correlation functions include not only the correlations between particles originating
from the dynamics but also those present in the initial state. one introduces again
two variational objects which now evolve in imaginary time. we study the symmetric
phase. we will consider the two-time function with two eld operators  and the two-
time function with four eld operators . we will relate it to the standard polarization
function r. at equilibrium, in the symmetric phase, the case of the correlation function
with two eld operators is special since the approximations obtained with or without
optimization with respect to the initial state concide. for the correlation function with
four eld operators, we will be obliged to combine the variational approximation with a
perturbative approximation valid for small values of the coupling constant, by neglecting
or taking into account at rst order a loop term in the dynamical equations. however, the
solutions remain nonperturbative since they depend on the self-consistent hb solution.
at the lowest order, by neglecting the loop term, the two-time function with four eld
operators is simply related to the two-time function with two eld operators according
to the wick theorem. at equilibrium, in the symmetric phase, we give to rst order
the expression for the two-time polarization functions with four eld operators : the
retarded green function r(q2, t, t) (eq. 4.133a) and the non-retarded green function
(q2, t, t) (eq. (3.144)). we verify explicitly that these functions depend only on the
time dierence t  t and not on the initial time t0. this is not the case for the non-
retarded green function if, like in the section 2, we optimize only the dynamics and not the
initial state. we check also that our approximations for the two-time correlation functions

satisfy the uctuation-dissipation theorem. the last section contains some conclusions and
perspectives for future work.

2 variational approximation for the two-time corre-

lation functions : optimization of the dynamics

2.1 denition of the generating functional for correlation func-

tions

we dene the operator a(j, t) which is a functional of the sources j and a function of
the time t in the following way :

a(j, t) = t exp iz 

t

dt (cid:26)z d3x j (x, t)h (x, t, t) + j (x, t)h (x, t, t)

+z d3x d3y j (x, y, t) (cid:16)h (x, t, t)h (y, t, t) + h (y, t, t)h(x, t, t)(cid:17)
+j (x, y, t) h (x, t, t)h(y, t, t) + j (x, y, t) h(x, t, t)h(y, t, t)o

(2.1)
where t is the time-ordered product of operators and h(x, t, t) and h (x, t, t) are
respectively the eld and momentum operators dened in the heisenberg representation.
they satisfy the boundary condition : h(x, t, t) = (x) and h(x, t, t) = (x), (x)
and (x) being the operators in the schrodinger representation. we use the short hand
notation

,

a(j, t) = t exp(cid:18)iz 

t

dt jj(t) oj(t, t)(cid:19)

(2.2)

the sources jj(t) (which are local or depend on two space points) are turned on between
t = t and t = +.

the functional a(j, t) satises the equation

d
dt

a(j, t) = i[a(j, t), h]  i a(j, t)xj

jj(t)oj

(2.3)

with the boundary condition a(t = +) = 1. we will consider the case of a self-
interacting scalar eld in a minkowski metric described by the hamiltonian h = r d3xh(x)

with :

we work in three spatial dimensions. the constants m0 and b are respectively the bare

the generating functional for the causal green functions writes

d(t0) being the initial state. the statistical operator d(t0) may represent a thermal
equilibrium or a nonequilibrium state. at zero temperature, it reduces to a projection
operator. in addition to the sources j, the generating functional z depends on the initial
time t0. this is a dierence with the generating functional usually considered in quantum
eld theories [12]. we want to evaluate the functional derivative of

w (j, t0) = i ln z(j, t0) .

(2.6)

w (j, t0) is the generating functional for the connected green functions. let us note that
for hermitic operators a(t) and d(t), w (j, t) is real. the expansion in powers of the
sources of w (j, t) writes :

w (j, t0) = i ln(n0) +z +

,

(2.7)
where n0 = t rd(t0) ( we choose not to normalize the operator d(t0)). we introduce the
following notations for the expectation values of one and two eld operators :

(x, t) =

n0

t r(cid:16)h (x, t, t0) d(t0)(cid:17) ,

g(x, y, t) =

t r(cid:16)h (x, t, t0) h (y, t, t0) d(t0)(cid:17)  (x, t) (y, t) .

the two-time causal functions with two eld operators are dened according to :

2.2 variational evaluation of the generating functional

we will use the time-dependent variational principle of balian and veneroni [6] to obtain
an approximation for our quantity of interest t r(d(t0)a(j, t0)). this principle is an
illustration of the general method developped in reference [13] to construct a variational
principle suited to the evaluation of a desired quantity. the basic idea is to consider
the equation (2.3) which denes a(j, t0) as a constraint and to introduce a lagrangian
multiplier d(t0) associated to this constraint.

we dene the action functional :

z (a(t),d(t)) = t r (a(t0) d(t0)) + zdyn ,

where

zdyn = t r z 

t0

dt d(t) 


dt  i(cid:20)a(t),z d3xh(x)(cid:21) + ia(t) 
da(t)
xj

jj(t)qj


we have written in a compact form the term which involves the sources j :

(2.14)

. (2.15)




(2.16)

pj jj(t)qj = z d3x (cid:16)j (x, t)(x) + j (x, t)(x)(cid:17)

+z d3x d3y j (x, y, t) ((x)(y) + (y)(x))
+z d3x d3y (cid:16)j (x, y, t)(x)(y) + j (x, y, t)(x)(y)(cid:17) .

the variational quantities of the action functional z are the observable-like operator
a(t) and the density-like operator d(t). we look for the stationarity of z with respect to
variations of a(t) and d(t) with the boundary conditions : a(t = +) = a(t = +) = 1
and d(t0) = d(t0). d(t0) is the initial statistical operator which we assume to be given
and equal to a gaussian density matrix. by construction of the variational principle,
the generating functional for the connected green functions will be approximated by the
value of the functional z at the stationary point :

w (j, t0) = i lnzst .

(2.17)

2.3 choice of the variational spaces

we restrict ourselves to trial operators a(t) and d(t) which are exponentials of quadratic
and linear forms of the eld operators (x) and (x) which we shall loosely call gaussian
operators.

a gaussian state d(t) is completely characterized by the vector (x, t) and the

matrix (x, y, t) dened by :

(x, t) =   (x, t)

i(x, t)! ,

10

(2.18)

where

(x, y, t) =   2g(x, y, t) it (x, y, t)

it (y, x, t) 2s(x, y, t)! ,

(x, t) =

1

n(t)

t r(d(t)(x)) ,

(x, t) =

1

n(t)

g(x, y, t) =

s(x, y, t) =

1

n(t)

1

n(t)

t r(d(t)(x)) ,
t r(d(t) (x) (y)) ,
t r(d(t) (x) (y)) ,

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

t (x, y, t) =

1

n(t)

t r(d(t)( (x) (y) + (y) (x))) ,
n(t) = t rd(t) ,

(2.25)
and, for any operator o : o = o  t r(d(t)o). the hermiticity of d(t) implies that the
matrices g, s and t are real and that g and s are symmetric in the space indices.

the heisenberg invariant is equal to :

i(x, y) = r d3z

(cid:16)4 < (x) (z) >< (z) (y) >
 < (x) (z) + (z) (x) > < (z) (y) + (y) (z) >(cid:17)

i(x, y) = z d3z (11(x, z) 22(z, y) + 12(x, z) 12(z, y)) .

for a pure state :

11 22  2
12 + 1 = 0
i(x, y) = 3(x  y)

(2.26)

(2.27)

(2.28)

(2.29)

in appendix a, we give the relations between our parametrization of a gaussian state
and the parametrization used by the authors of reference [9].

we then introduce the operators tb = a(t) d(t) and tc = d(t) a(t) [14]. the
operator tb is a gaussian operator which is characterized by the following expectation
values :

n(t) = t rtb = t rtc ,

n(t)

t r(tb(x)) ,

b(x, t) =

b(x, t) =

1

1

n(t)

gb(x, y, t) =

n(t)

t r(tb(x)) ,
t r(tb (x) (y)) ,

(2.30)

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

sb(x, y, t) =

1

n(t)

t r(tb (x) (y)) ,

tb(x, y, t) =

1

n(t)

t r(tb( (x) (y) + (y) (x))) ,

(2.34)

(2.35)

with (x) = (x)  b(x, t) and (x) = (x)  b(x, t).

similarly the operator tc is a gaussian operator which is characterized by the quan-
tities n, c, c, gc, sc, tb ( obtained by replacing tb by tc in (2.31)-(2.35)). for d(t) = 1,
one has b(x, t) = c(x, t) = a(x, t) (and similar denitions for a, ga, sa, ta). for
a(t) = 1, one has b(x, t) = c(x, t) = d(x, t) (and similar denitions for d, gd, sd, td).
in appendix c, we give the expressions of b, c, b and c as functions of the independent
variational quantities a, a and d, d which characterize respectively a and d.

with this choice of the trial spaces for a(t) and d(t) , the wick theorem allows us

to express the functional z in the form :

z = n(t0) +z +

,

(2.36)

where the energy density e(x, t) = t r (d(t) h(x, t)) is given, for the hamiltonian density

the last term of the functional (2.36), kc = t r(cid:16)tc pj jj(t) qj(cid:17) = r d3x1d3x2kc(x1, x2, t),
with the parametrization we use, the boundary conditions d(t0) = d(t0) and

a(t = +) = 1 correspond respectively :

nd(t0) = n0 , d(t0) = 0 , d(t0) = 0 ,

(2.40)

a(t = +) = 0 .

(2.41)

we will write the conditions for the stationarity of the functional z with respect to the
variations of nd, d, d and na, a, a.

2.4 dynamical equations with sources

by varying the expression (2.36) with respect to nd, d, d, with the boundary conditions

nd(t0) = n0 , d(t0) = 0 , d(t0) = 0 ,

(2.42)

we obtain the evolution equation for na, a and a. integrating (2.36) by parts and varying
with respect to na, a, a with the boundary conditions

na(t = +) = 1 , 1

a (t = +) = 0 ,

1
a

a(t = +) = 0 ,

(2.43)

we obtain the evolution equations for nd, d and d. in general the evolution equations
for nd, d, d and those for na, a, a are coupled. the solutions nd, d, d and na, a, a
depend on the sources. owing to this dependence, we will be abble to obtain non trivial
approximations for the correlation functions in spite of the gaussian nature of the trial

operators.

by combining the evolution equation for nd, d, d with those for na, a, a, the
dynamical equations for the expectation values b, b and c, c can be written in the
following compact form :

i b =  wb ,
i c =  (wc  wc

k) ,

i b = 2 (b hb    hb b) ,
k)    (hc  i c

i c = 2 (c (hc  i c

k) c) .

(2.44)

(2.45)

(2.46)

(2.47)

we have also n(t) = 0.

the vector wb and the matrix hb are dened from the variation of < h >b=

2 z d3x d3y tr [hb(x, y, t) b(y, x, t)] .

(2.48)

k are dened from the variation of < h >c= t r(tch) and

t r(tbh) :
 < h >b= z d3x wb(x, t) b(x, t) 
similarly, wc,hc and wc
from the variation of the source term kc.

therefore, by using a convenient parametrization for the two variational objects
d(t) and a(t), we have been abble to obtain dynamical equations in a very compact form
even for nite values of the sources. the dynamical equations for d, d and a, a have
a more complicated form. they are given in appendix d where we give also the explicit
expressions of the vectors w, wc
k in the case of the 4
theory. in spite of their simple form, the equations (2.44)-(2.47) are coupled because the
solutions b, b and c, c do not satisfy simple boundary conditions.

k and of the matrices h and i c

let us note that the coupled equations for d, d (a, a) do not conserve neither
the energy < h >d (< h >a) nor the entropy sd (sa) (see appendix b for the denition
of the von-neuman entropy for bosons). on the other hand, the dynamical equations for
b and b (eqs. (2.44) and (2.46) ) which have the same form as the mean-eld tdhb
equations conserve the pseudo-energy < h >b and the pseudo-entropy sb.

the expansion in powers of the sources of the stationarity conditions (2.44)- (2.47)
will provide approximate dynamical equations for the expectation values and the corre-
lation functions dened in eqs. (2.8)-(2.13).

are no sources. the limit with vanishing sources corresponds to

these equations are the analog for the 4 theory of the time-dependent hartree-bogoliubov
(tdhb) equations in nonrelativistic physics. they are equivalent to the dynamical equa-
tions obtained in reference [9] where the authors used an alternative form of the balian-
veneroni variational principle suited to the evaluation of single-time expectation values
[15].

in reference [10], we have shown that these tdhb equations for the 4 theory
can be written as classical dynamical equations with a nonsymplectic poisson structure
with the free-energy density playing the role of a classical hamiltonian. the heisenberg
invariant (2.26) appears as a structural invariant of the poisson structure.

(2.64)

in the next sections, the dynamical equations for the two-time correlation functions
will involve the bare coupling constant b. this one will be understood as a function of
the cuto . we will solve the dynamical equations for a nite value of the cuto. in
the static case, we will show that the nal formula obtained for the two-time correlation
functions can be written with the renormalized parameters.

(2.66)

the rst derivatives of w (j, t0) = i lnzst with respect to the sources are equal to the
expectations values with the index c. indeed, the functional z depend on the sources
both explicitly and implicitly since the approximate solutions for d(t) and a(t) depend

16

on the sources. however, at the stationary point, only the explicit dependence contributes
to the rst derivative :

which gives for instance :

jj(t)

= i t r (d(t)a(t)qj) ,

w

j(x, t)

= c(x, t) .

(2.67)

(2.68)

the expressions for the second derivatives of w are much more complicated. the intro-
duction of sources coupled to the composite operators (x)(y), (x)(y) and (x)(y)
together with eq. (2.68) allows us to obtain dynamical equations for the two-time cor-
relation functions with three or four eld operators merely from the expansion of the
expectation values c and c at the rst order in powers of the sources.

from the rst order corrections c  (0) and c  (0), we dene the two-time

correlation functions  and  ( is a vector and  is a matrix) :

(2.76)

in these equations the matrix h has to be evaluated for the tdhb solutions (0), (0) of
eqs. (2.52) and (2.53). the variations of wc
k(x, y, t)
(eqs. (d.20)-(d.22)) with respect to j(t) will give terms proportional to (t t). from
the variations wc and hc, we dene the matrices tij, ti,jk, rij,k, rij,kl (which are the
analogues of the random phase approximation (rpa) kernel of balian and veneroni [6]) :

k(x, t) (eqs. (d.18)-(d.19)) and of i c

these matrices depend on the tdhb solutions (0) and (0). their expressions in the case
of the 4 theory are given in appendix d. with these notations, the dynamical equations
for the two-time and two-point correlation function  and the two-time and three-point
correlation function  write :

these dynamical equations are not sucient since the boundary conditions are

1
a(t = +) = 0 and d(x, t0) = 0(x), d(x, y, t0) = 0(x, y). but,
at this step, we have used the expansion of only one half of our variational parameters.
we will use also the dynamical equations for the two-time functions m and l dened from
the expansion in powers of the sources of 1

from the relations of appendix c, we will be abble to obtain relations between
the functions k(t0, t) and lk(t, t0) one the one hand and the functions k(t0, t) and
mk(t, t0)  lk(t, t0)0 on the other hand. indeed, that at the rst order :

from eqs. (c.5) and (c.2), we obtain at the rst order :

(2.85)

at the initial time, d = 0, d = 0 and we have the following relations between the
two-time functions :

k(t0, t) = (0   ) lk(t, t0) (0 +  )

k(t0, t) = (0   ) (mk(t, t0)  lk(t, t0)0)

where the matrices r and r have been dened in (2.78).

similarly, from the dynamical equation for 1

a a at the rst order, we obtain a
backward dynamical equation for mk(t, t). it is actually more convenient to consider the
function mk(t, t)  lk(t, t)(0)(t) which is solution of :
i d

the same matrices t, t, r, r coming from the expansion of < h > at the second
order arround the tdhb solution appear in equations (2.79),(2.80) for  and  and in
equations (2.89),(2.90) for m and l. this leads to consider the following quantity :

tr(cid:16)lk(t, t)k(t, t)(cid:17)

(2.100)

where m is the transpozed vector of m. more explicitly, by reintroducing the space
coordinates, f (t, t) writes in the case of the functions m, l,  and  :

f (t, t) = 2z d3x(cid:18) m(x, x1, t, t) z d3u (0)(u, t)l(u, x, x1, t, t)(cid:19) (x1, x2, t, t)

(2.101)
the quantity f k is independent of the time t : from the dynamical equations (2.79),(2.80)
and (2.89),(2.90), one shows that its derivative with respect to t is equal to a sum of
functions (t  t) and (t  t) :
dt f k = i k(t, t)

the fact that f k does not depend on the time t will save us to solve one dynamical
equation.

by considering the local sources j (x, t) and by integrating equation (2.102) from
t = + to t = t0, we obtain an approximation for the two-time and two-point function.
for t > t :

our conventions for the fourrier transforms are dened in appendix d.

(2.104)

these two last expressions will still be valid when we will optimize with respect to
the initial state in section 3. on the contrary, the following expression will not be valid
in section 3. by using (2.86) and (2.87), we obtain :

1 (t, t) = 2( m(t, t0)  0l(t, t0)) (0   ) (m(t, t0)  l(t, t0)0)

for t > t, one interchanges the operators h(t, t0) and h(t, t0). by using the expres-
sion of the retarded green functions (see bellow), we show :

for the correlation functions with the anti-t-product, it is sucient to replace in
the functional z (2.36) the source term kc by the analogous term kb. this is equivalent
to exchange the matrices 0   and 0 +  in the previous formula (or to exchange t
and t).

1 (t, t) and for the two-time and four-point function 

from the function f k(t, t), we obtain also, by considering now the bilocal sources

l(t, t) = 0 for t  t. similarly, m(t, t)  l(t, t)(0)(t) = 0 for t  t. therefore, we
have in the symmetric phase and for t > t :

to conclude, in order to obtain approximations for the causal correlation functions
c 2, c 3 and c 4, we have rst to solve the tdhb equations (2.52) and (2.53) for (0)(t) and
(0)(t) and to evaluate the matrices r, r, t and t for the tdhb solutions. we then solve
equations (2.89) and (2.90) for l(t, t) and m(t, t)  l(t, t)(0)(t) (t > t  t0) backward
in time from t to t0 with the boundary conditions (2.91)-(2.99). finally, we evaluate
expression (2.105). therefore, it is not necessary to solve the dynamical equations (2.79)
and (2.80) for (t, t) and (t, t) .

the expressions we obtain in this way for three-point and four point correlation
functions are not completly satisfactory. indeed, in the static case, when (0)(t) = 0 and
(0)(t) = 0 are time-independent, the approximate correlation functions do not depend
only on the time dierence t t as they should (the two-point function in the symmetric
phase is a particular case). we will cure this artefact by optimizing with respect to the
initial state in section 3.

retarded green functions :

the function 

1 is an approximation for the green function with the time-ordered

green function :

c 2

(x, y, t, t) = t r(cid:16)t h (x, t, t0) h (y, t, t0)d(t0)(cid:17)

t r(cid:16)h(x, t, t)d(t0)(cid:17) t r(cid:16)h (y, t, t0)d(t0)(cid:17)

.

(2.114)

to obtain the approximations for the anticausal two-time functions, it is sucient to
replace in the functional (2.36) the term kc by the analogous term kb. formula (2.105)
and (2.106) are then interchanged.

the retarded green function is dened by :

(x, y, t, t) = i (t  t)t r(cid:16)[h (x, t, t0), h(y, t, t0)]d(t0)(cid:17) .

(2.115)

it is interesting to obtain an approximation for the retarded green function. it is this
green function which appears in the study of the response of the system to a small exter-
nal perturbation. moreover, the kms condition allows to relate the dierent components
of the green function in the real time formalism for quantum field theories at nite
temperature [17]. these components can all be expressed from the retarded green func-
tion. the real parts of the time-ordered green function c 2 and of the retarded green
function  coincide. they describe phenomena such as debye screening in a plasma in the
problem of charged particules in an external electromagnetic eld. but one has to con-
sider the imaginary part of the retarded green function to describe damping phenomena
[18]. the optimization with respect to the initial state in section 3 will allows to obtain
approximated green functions wich verify the kms condition (the uctuation-disspation
theorem).

23

from expression (2.106) and the analogous formula for the correlation function with

the anti-t product, we obtain an approximation for the retarded green function :

(x, y, t, t) = i (t  t)

h4(cid:16) m(t, t0)  0l(t, t0)(cid:17)  (cid:16)m(t, t0)  l(t, t0)0(cid:17)
+tr(cid:16)l(t, t0)0l(t, t0)(cid:17)  tr(cid:16)l(t, t0) l(t, t0)0(cid:17)i

(2.116)

in the symetric phase :

(~x, ~y, t, t) = i (t  t) 4 m(t, t0) m(t, t0) .

(2.117)

the exact expression (2.115) remains identical if we translate the refence time t0
to another time t such as t > t > t0. by using the dynamical equation for (0)(t)
and equations (2.89) and (2.90), we show that the approximation (2.116) has the same
property. indeed, if we call r(t, t) the expression obtained by replacing in the bracket
of equation (2.116) t0 by t with t0  t < t, we have for t > t :

dr
dt

= 2( m(t, t)  (0)(t))l(t, t)   1

0! (t  t)

we deduce : dr

dt = 0 pour t < t. we thus have :

(x, y, t, t) = i (t  t)r(t, t)

(2.118)

(2.119)

when the time t tends to t, the exact formula (2.115) concides with the commuta-
tor of two elds h(t, t0) at equal time which is vanishing. the approximated expression
gives also (t, t) = 0 since m

2 and l(t, t) = 0.

1 (t, t) =  1

similarly, we can obtain approximations for the retarded green function with two

eld operators  dened according to :

,(x, y, z, u, t, t) = i(tt)t r(cid:16)[h (x, t, t0)h (y, t, t0), h (z, t, t0)h (u, t, t0)]d(t0)(cid:17) .

(2.120)
in the symmetric phase, from expression (2.113) and from the analogous formula for the
correlation function with the anti-t product, we deduce an approximation for the retarded
green function with two eld operators :

,(p1, p2, p3,x pi, t, t) = i (t  t) z
tr[l(p  p1  p2,p, p1, p2, t, t0) 0(p) l(p,p + p1 + p2, p3,x pi, t, t0)  ]
tr[l(p  p1  p2,p, p1, p2, t, t0)  l(p,p + p1 + p2, p3,x pi, t, t0) 0(p + p1 + p2)]

(2.121)
indded, if
again, the right member of this equation does not depend on the time t0.
we call s(t, t) the expression obtained by replacing in the right member t0 by t, with

d3p

and we deduce : ds

ik
j    l(t, t) 
dt = 0 for t < t. we have therefore :
,(p1, p2, p3,x pi, t, t) = i (t  t)s(t, t)

(2.122)

(2.123)

the limit when the two times t and t concide :

when t  t, t = t = t + 0, expression (2.105) for the approximated two point

function becomes :

1 (t, t) = 2( m(t, t0)  0l(t, t0)) (0   ) (m(t, t0)  l(t, t0)0)

2

trhl(t, t0)(0   )l(t, t0)(0 +  )i

(2.124)

at the initial time t = t0, we get as we should the tdhb result : 
1 (t0, t0) = g0. indeed,
1 (t0, t0) = 1/2 and l(t0, t0) = 0. however for later times, this approximation is in
m
general dierent from the result of the tdhb evolution : 1
2(0)(t) = g(0)(t). the case at
equilibrium in the symmetric phase is a special case since, as we will show in section 3,
we have :


1 (p, t = 0) = g0(p)

(2.125)

this wont be true in the asymmetric phase. the result (2.125) is to relate to the fact
that, at equilibrium in the symmetric phase, the two approximations for the two-time and
two-point function obtained with or without the optimization with respect to the initial
state concide (see below eq. (3.58)).

let us examine the four-point function when the two times concide. in the sym-
metric phase, the limit t = t  0 = t + 0 in expression (2.111) for the four-point function

11 gives :



11 (p1, p2, p3,p pi, t, t) = z

the boundary conditions for the function l write

2 h3(p1 + p3) + 3(p2 + p3)i ,

(2.127)

11 (p1, p2, p3,x pi, t0, t0) =

11(p1)0

11(p2)h3(p1 + p3) + 3(p2 + p3)i .

the mean-eld approximation for which c4 = 0 corresponds to (see eq. (2.74)) :



11 (x, y, z, u, t, t) = 2

1 (x, z, t, t)

1 (y, z, t, t)
= 2g(0)(x, z, t)g(0)(y, u, t) + 2g(0)(x, u, t)g(0)(y, z, t)

1 (y, u, t, t) + 2

1 (x, u, t, t)

.

(2.129)

in momentum space, this corresponds to :



11 (p1, p2, p3,x pi, t, t) = 2

1 (p1, t, t)

1 (p2, t)[(p3 + p1) + (p3 + p2)]

(2.130)

at the initial time, we recover the result of the wick theorem given by expression 2.128 in
momentum space. however, for later times, owing to the correlations we have taken into
account in the dynamics, approximation (2.126) for the four-point correlation function is
dierent from the result of the wick theorem.

in nonrelativistic many-body problems, the mean-eld tdhf calculations correctly
predict the expectation values but underestimate the uctuations. balian and veneroni
have showed the advantage to use a variational principle adapted to calculate the uctua-
tions. for a pur state in the case of heavy-ions collisions, one obtains in this way a better
agreement with experiments for the width of the mass distributions [19]. the example of
the quartic oscillator in one dimension shows also the usefullness of the method developped
by balian and veneroni to calculate the uctuations of the operator x2, < x4 >  < x2 >2,
though staying in a mean-eld approach [14].

3 optimization of the initial state

3.1

introduction

in physical situations, the initial state is not completly known. only the expectation
values of a few observables are known, for instance :

, h(x)(y)it0

, h(x)(y)(z)it0

h(x)it0
the exact state d(t0) can be written as exp( h). the operator h is equal to
the hamiltonian of the system at thermal equilibrium but it can also contain other terms
corresponding to conserved quantities, like the charge operator for a complex scalar eld.
for a nonequilibrium situation, the operator h is dierent from the hamiltonian h.

, h(x)(y)(z)(u)it0 .

(3.1)

we will approximate this initial state in the following way. we use the fact that the

operator e h is a solution of the bloch equation :

d
du

eu h =  h eu h , 0 < u <  .

(3.2)

following the general method of [6], [13] to evaluate variationally a given quantity, we
introduce an ansatz operator d(t) and we consider equation (3.2) as a constraint for the
complex times t = t0 + i(u) with the boundary condition d(t0 + i) = 1. we introduce
also a lagrange multiplier a(t) associated to this constraint. the functional to minimize
writes :

z(a(t),d(t)) = t r (a(t0 + i 0) d(t0 + i 0))t rz t0+i
(3.3)
where zdyn is given by expression (2.15) of section 2. the ansatz operators d(t) and a(t)
are subject to the boundary conditions a() = 1 and d(t0 + i ) = 1.

+ i h d(t)!+zdyn ,

dta(t) dd(t)

dt

t0

let us note that for a complex value of t, a(t) is not close to 1 in the limit of vanish-
ing sources. indeed, the stationarity condition of z with respect to arbitrary variations
of d(t) writes :

da(t)
dt  ia(t) h = 0

(3.4)

and the solution of this equation for t = t0 + i(  u) is equal to : a(t) = a(t0) exp(( 
u) h).

the approximate dynamical equation for d(t) and a(t) are coupled. d(t0) depends

on a(t) for t > t0 and therefore on the sources j contrary to the exact state d(t0).

27

3.2 the variational spaces

for the variational spaces for d(t) and a(t), we choose again gaussian operators charac-
terized by the contractions d(x, t), d(x, y, t) and a(x, t), a(x, y, t) where the time t is
on the two segments [t0 + i , t0[ and [t0, +[ in the complex plane.

the boundary condition d(t0 + i) = 1 writes :

1

d (t0 + i) = 0

,

1
d

d(t0 + i) = 0 .

(3.5)

let us write the functional z (3.3) with the elementary contractions :

z(na, a, a; nd, d, d) = n(t0)z t0

t0+i 

dt "dn(t)

dt

|a(t)=cte + i n(t) z d3x ec(x, t)# +zdyn ,

(3.6)

or, by integrating by part :

z(na, a, a; nd, d, d) = n(t0+i)+z t0

t0+i 

dt"dn(t)

dt

|d(t)=cte  i n(t) z d3x ec(x, t)#+zdyn .

(3.7)

we have used the notation :

z d3x ec(x, t) = t r(cid:16)d(t) a(t) h(cid:17) =< h >c

.

(3.8)

3.3 the dynamical equations

for complex values of the time t0 + i  < t < t0, the dynamical equations for the contrac-
tions d, d, a and a write :

2i d =  (d +  ) hc (d   )  bc + (d +  ) wc ,

i d =  (d +  ) hc (d   ) ,

2i a = (a   ) hc (a +  )  cb  (a   ) wc ,

i a = (a   ) hc (a +  ) .

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

these dynamical equations are coupled through the boundary conditions d(t0 + i) =
1,a(t = +) = 1 which write :

1

d (t0 + i) = 0 ,

1
a (t = +) = 0 ,

d(t0 + i) = 0 ,

a(t = +) = 0 .

1
d

1
a

28

(3.13)

(3.14)

for the contractions b, b et c, c, the dynamical equation write :

b = 0 ,

b = 0 ,

i c =  wc ,

i c = 2 (cid:16)c hc   hcc(cid:17) .

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

we have d< h>c

dt = 0. we have introduce the vector wc and the matrix hc (analogous
to w and h ) to express the variation  < h > in terms of the variations c and c. all
the contractions  et  are continous at t = t0. in the complex time interval [t0 + i, t0],
b and b are constant : b = b(t0), b = b(t0).

3.4 expansion in powers of the sources

d (t), a(t) = (0)

d (t), d(t) = (0)

we use the index (0) for the solutions of the dynamical equations in the limit with no source
: d(t) = (0)
a (t), a(t) = (0)
a (t). since a(t) 6= 1 even in
the limit with no source, this limit does not correspond to 1
a = 0, contrary
a
to what happens when we do not optimize the initial state (see section 2). therefore,
(0)
d . however, we can use a continuity property at t = t0. in the
b
limit with no source, a(t0 + i0) = a(t0 + 0)  1. at the time t0, we thus have :

d and (0)

a = 0, 1

6= (0)

b

6= (0)

(0)
b (t0) = (0)

c (t0) = (0)

d (t0) = 0 ,

(0)
b (t0) = (0)

c (t0) = (0)

d (t0) = 0 ,

(3.19)

(3.20)

where 0 and 0 are the hb static solutions associated to the operator h and verify :

w0 = 0 ,

(3.21)

0 h0  =  h0 0 .

(3.22)
0 et h0 are related by equations similar to (2.55) and (2.56). the expressions for
the vector w0 = w( 0, 0) and the matrix h0 = h( 0, 0) are obtained from those in
appendix d by replacing f0 and g0 by the time-independent functions f0 and g0. (we
recall that h comes from the variation of < h > with respect to  and has to be evaluated
at 0, 0 to obtain h0. since h is a time-independent operator, h0 is time-independent.)
we stress the dierence between the quantities (0), 0 and 0.

29

the expansion at zero order of equations (3.9)-(3.12) writes :

2 i (0)

i (0)
d = (cid:16)(0)

2 i (0)

a = (cid:16)(0)

d = 0 and (0)

since w0 = 0, we have for t0 + i < t < t0 :
continuity at t = t0, we thus obtain for 0 < u <  :

one checks that for u = , (0)1

at the rst order, w(0)

c (t0) = w0(t0) = 0 and (0)

c (t0) = 0. therefore the right
members of equations (3.17) and (3.18) are vanishing at t0. we deduce that at the rst
order in the expansion in powers of the sources, c and c are constant in the interval [t0 +
i, t0] and equal to 0 and 0 respectively. we can also obtain this result from the relations
of appendix c and from the expressions obtained above for (0)
a (t).

at the next order, the approximated initial state characterized by d(t0), d(t0) is

no more equal to the static hb solution 0, 0.

instead of using the expansion of equations (3.9) and (3.10) for d and d, it is
more convenient to expand at the rst order equations (3.17) and (3.18) for c and c.

the matrices t, t and r, r associated to the operator h and depending on 0 and on
0 are analogous to the matrices t, t, r and r. the quantities h0, 0, 0 are time-
independent for t0 + i  t  t0. the matrices t, t and r, r are also time-independent for
t0 +i  t  t0. indeed, these are dened from the expansion of wc and hc in terms of the
variations c and c (see equations (2.77) and (2.78)) and they have to be evaluated for
the values (0)
. now, as we have noticed before, these quantities do not depend
on the complex time and are equal respectively to 0 and 0. for the same reason, 0
appears in the last two lines of (3.36) and not (0)
d as in equation (2.80) which describes
the evolution of (t, t) for real time.

(3.39)

(3.40)

(3.41)

(3.42)

with p = qg0(p).

we then use the fact that d(t0 + i) = 1. we deduce :

c(t0 + i) = b(t0 + i)

, c(t0 + i) = b(t0 + i) .

(3.43)

by introducing the functions  and  which come from the expansion at the rst order in
powers of the sources of b and b (and which are analogous to  and ), we thus have :

(t0 + i, t) = (t0 + i, t)

(t0 + i, t) = (t0 + i, t)

(3.44)

(3.45)

now b and b are constants for t0 + i < t < t0 (eq. (3.15) and (3.16)). consequently :

(t0, t) = (t0 + i, t)

(t0, t) = (t0 + i, t)

(3.46)

(3.47)

let us compare the expansion of b, c and b, c at t0. by using equation (c.6) at t = t0,

k(t0, t) = (0 +  ) lk(t, t0) (0   ) ,

and from equation (c.1) :

k(t0, t) = (0 +  )(mk(t, t0)  lk(t, t0) 0) .

(3.48)

(3.49)

32

the comparison of these last two equations to (2.86) and (2.87) leads to :

k(t0, t) = k(t0, t) + 2 (mk(t, t0)  lk(t, t0)0)

k(t0, t) = k(t0, t) + 2 0lk(t, t0)  2  lk(t, t0)0 .

finally, we use :

(t0 + i, t) = (t0, t)

(t0 + i, t) = (t0, t)

in the symmetric phase, l = 0, therefore :

(t0 + i, t) = (t0, t) + 2 m(t, t0)

from equation (3.41), we obtain :

(p, t0, t) = (cid:16)a1(p)  1(cid:17)1

1 (p, t, t) = 4 m(p, t, t0)(cid:16)(a1(p)  1)1 + 1(cid:17)  m(p, t, t0)

we check again that in the limit t = t = t0, we obtain the tdhb solution at t0 :
1 (p, t0, t0) = 1

2p

coth(p) = g0(p, t0).

for the two-point function in the symmetric phase, one can check from expression
(2.57) for the matrix 0 (and where the quantities which appear correspond now to h
and no more h) that :

0(p)   = 2(a1(p)  1)1

(3.59)

therefore expressions (2.109) and (3.56) for 
1 in the symmetric phase obtained without
or with optimization with respect to the initial state concide when 0 = 0 which is
the case at equilibrium. this is not true in the asymmetric phase. it will be also more
interesting to study the four-point function in section 3.6.

it is also interesting to calculate the approximation obtained for the retarded green
function (2.115) when we optimize both the dynamics and the initial state. in the sym-
metric phase, we have for the time-ordered correlation function for t > t :

1 (t, t) = 2 m(t, t0)(t0, t)


(3.60)

33

for the anti-t product and t > t :


1 (t, t) = 2 m(t, t0)(t0, t)

by using (3.55) and the fact that

we obtain :

(a1(p)  1)1 +h (a1(p)  1)1it
(p, t, t) = i(t  t) 4 m(p, t, t0) m(p, t, t0)

=  ,

(3.61)

(3.62)

(3.63)

which is identical to the formula (2.117) obtained without the optimization of the initial
state. for the retarded green function the approach of section 2 is therefore sucient.

the case at equilibrium

in this case, the two-time functions should depend only on the dierence t  t.
unfortunatly, this is not true for the expressions we gave for the three-point and four-
point functions in section 2. at equilibrium, (0)(t) = 0, (0)(t) = 0 and the matrices
t, t, r, r are constant. in equations (2.89) and (2.90) for lk and mk, the shift t  t + t is
therefore equivalent to a shift of the initial time t0  t0t. by writing the corresponding
shifts of the functions lk and mk  lk0 and by inserting them in eq. (2.105) or in eq.
(2.107), one sees that, in general, our approximations are not invariant under the shift
t  t + t, t  t + t, t0 being constant. they contain a spurious dependence on the
initial time t0.

11g0 +0

1 is proportional to 0

the case of the two-point function in the symmetric phase is special. from equation
(2.90) for m, we have m = it mt and the variation of expression (2.109) is equal to
zero because 
22 which is vanishing for the static solution.
however, this is no more true for the four-point function  given by equation (2.113).
the variation  involves two types of terms : one with the matrix r proportional to
the coupling constant and another with the matrix h0. generally,  is non vanishing.
this spurious dependence on the initial time will disappear when we take into account the
optimization with respect to the initial state : the two-time correlation functions depend
only on the time dierence t  t as they should.

at equilibrium, in the symmetric phase, we can solve equation (2.90) for m :

we check that 
1 depends only on t = t  t. expressions (3.66) and (3.67) are
interchanged by changing t to t, which was not explicit on formula (3.56) and (3.58).
1 (p, t = 0) = g0(p). in this case, at equal time, the two-
time and two-point function concides with the mean-eld hb solution for the two-point
function.

for t = 0, we obtain 

by taking the fourrier transform in time of equations (3.66) and (3.67) :



1 (p, ) = z 0

(3.69)

where np is the occupation number : 2np + 1 = coth p

we will now show that our approximation for the two-time correlation function with
two eld operators satises to the uctuation-dissipation theorem. this theorem can be
written as a relation between the fourrier transform in time of the correlation function
c 2

(x, x, t, t) and the response function

2(x, x, t, t) = t r(cid:16)[h (x, t, t0), h(x, t, t0)]d(t0)(cid:17)

in the following way :

2(x, x, ) = (1  e) c 2

(x, x, ) ,

where the fourrier transform in time is dened according to :

2(x, x, ) = z +



d(t  t) ei(tt )2(x, x, t  t)

(3.70)

(3.71)

(3.72)

the correlation function c 2 gives us informations about the uctuations in the equilib-
rium state while the response function 2 contains informations on the dynamics of the
system which has been driven from the equilibrium by a small external perturbation.
the function 2 appears also in the dissipation energy of the system. therefore, the
uctuation-disspation theorem tells us that, in systems near equilibrium, the transport
properties which are linear in the external forces can be calculated from the uctuations
at equilibrium [20].

by using the denition

t r(h(x, t, t0)h(y, t, t0)d(t0))  (x, t)(y, t) < (x,  )(y,  ) >

(3.73)

35

with  = t  t, the uctuation-dissipation theorem can be written in the following way :



r +

d ei < (x,  )(y) >= ez +
= z +



d ei < (y)(x,  ) >
d ei(i) < (x,   i)(y) >



(3.74)

in order to check the uctuation-dissipation theorem on our approximations for the two-
point correlation function, it is therefore sucient to check that expression (3.66) for
t =  is equivalent to expression (3.67) for t =   i, which can be done easely.

at equilibrium, expression (2.117) for the retarded green function with two eld

operators in the symmetric phase gives :

3.6 four-point function : a perturbative expansion

still in the symmetric phase and for the uniform case, we consider now the four-point
function .

3.6.1 the response function r(q2, t, t)

when one couples a source j (x, y, t) to the the operator h (x, t, t0)h(y, t, t0), the
linear response theory gives the variation of g(x, y, t) = t r(h(x, t, t0)h (y, t, t0)d(t0))

a variational approximation for the polarization function r is obtained by using expres-
sion (2.121) for , as a function of l and 0.

in the static case, r(q2, t, t) depends only on t = t  t and is proportional to

(t  t). we thus dene its fourrier transform in time by :

r(q2, ) = z +

0

d(t) eit+tr(q2, t)

(3.82)

the polarization function r(q2, t, t) can be recognized as the fourrier transform
with respect to x  y of the retarded green function for the operators 2(x) and 2(y) :
2,2(x, x, y, y, t, t) = i(tt)t r(cid:16)[h (x, t, t0)h (x, t, t0), h(y, t, t0)h (y, t, t0)]d(t0)(cid:17)

we have :

2,2(q2, t, t) = z d3x eiq .(xy) 2,2(x, x, y, y, t, t)

= r(q2, t, t)

(3.84)

this function is directly related to the viscuosity in the 4 theory. from the spectral
representation :

2,2(p, p0) = lim

we will show the dierences between the approximations for the function (q2, t, t)
when we do or do not optimize with respect to the initial state.

these equations are analogous to (2.80), the matrices h0, r and r being replaced by the
time-independent matrices h0, r and r associated to h and (0) by 0. we see that we
are not abble to obtain directly an expression analogous to (3.41) which would relate the
matrices (t0, t) and (t0 + i, t) since the loop term b
11 i involve all the momenta.

we will use a perturbative expansion where we neglect this loop term to lowest order.

to lowest order, by neglecting the loop term i, the solutions of equations (3.89)-

(3.92) write :

12 (u, t) = q+k [a1 sinh(3u) + b1 cosh(3u) + c1 sinh(4u) + d1 cosh(4u)] (3.97)

the frequencies

we can therefore express (k,q  k, p1, q  p1, t0 + i, t) as a function of

(k,q  k, p1, q  p1, t0, t). the result is the following :

if we do not optimize with respect to the initial state, an approximation for the

where 0 is given by (2.57), g0 being replaced by g0.

the matrix elements 

ij (t0, t) can therefore be written in terms of l

ij (t, t0). by
using (3.111), we nally obtain an approximation for the two-time and four-point function

11 (t, t) which involves only the function l. we recall that this approximation has
been obtained by neglecting the loop term i (3.93) in the evolution equations of  for
complex values of the time.

3.6.3 resolution of the dynamical equations for l in the static case

the dynamical equations for the matrix elements of l are given by (2.89). in the static

when it was possible the arguments of l. let us remark that, on the contrary to

similarly to the resolution of the equations for , we will solve the equations
for l, perturbatively, neglecting rst the loop term j. in the following section, we will
take into account of the loop term j to rst order. to lowest order, the solutions of
(3.114)-(3.117) write :

(3.125)

when we neglect the loop terms i and j in the dynamical equations for  for the
complex time and in the dynamical equations for l for the time t > t0, we thus recover
the wick theorem as we should. let us stress that we have neglected the interactions
which appear in the terms i and j but the interactions remain in the frequencies k which
involve the renormalized self-consistent mass m() (eq. (2.66)).

at this order, 

11 depends only on the time dierence t = t  t and our ap-
proximation satises the uctuation-dissipation theorem for the two-time and four-point
correlation function.

41

if we apply formula (2.111), obtained without optimization with respect to the initial
state, with the solutions l given by (3.120)-(3.123), we nd again the result of the wick
theorem. when we neglect the terms with the interaction in the dynamical equations for
 and l, the two approximations for 
11 (t, t) obtained with or without optimization
with respect to the initial state therefore concide. accordingly, at zero order, we can use
instead of expression (3.113) the simpler expression :

(k,qk, p1,p1+q, t0, t) = (cid:16)0(k)  (cid:17) l(k,qk, p1, qp1, t, t0)(cid:16)0(q  k) + (cid:17)

(3.126)
the existence of such an expression with matrices (to distinguish from a vectorial expres-
sion like (3.105) was not obvious at the beginning.

we stress again that this formula is nonperturbative in the sense that it contains the
renormalized self-consistent mass.

3.6.4 resolution of the dynamical equations with the interaction terms i and

j at rst order

at rst order, we will solve the dynamical equations (3.89)-(3.92) for
(k,q  k, p1,p1 + q, u, t) by replacing in the loop integral i the solution 
obtained at the lowest order. we thus have to solve a rst order dierential sytem with
a nonhomogeneous term which involves :

i(u) = z

the constants a,b,c and d depend on the momenta l and q. they can be expressed in terms
of the matrix elements ij(l,ql, pi, qpi, t0, t) and cosh(5), sinh(6), cosh(6),
sinh(6). at the order we consider, we can use (3.126) and express a, b, c, d with the
matrix elements l

occupation numbers nl et nl+q dened by :

when we optimize with respect to initial state, the second term of (3.143) tr[l(t, t0)x(t0, t)]
cancels exactly the term p (1). one checks also that at t = t = t0, this second term is
vanishing.

in order to obtain the expression of (q2, t, t), we have used a symmetry in the
exchange of k and p1 of the function to integrate in (q2, t, t). it is important to note
that the function r d3p1

11 (k,q  k, p1, q  p1, t, t) remains dependent on t0.

(2)3 

for t > t, expression (3.143) becomes :

 tr[l(p + q,p, k,q  k, t, t0)x(t0, t)]

(3.148)

46

and one shows that one obtains (1)(q2, t) from (3.144) by replacing t by t.

similarly to the case of the green function with two eld operators (x)(y), we can
check the uctuation-dissipation theorem for the green function with four eld operators
2(x)2(y). the expression of (q2,  ) for t > 0 is indeed equivalent to expression
(3.144) of (q2,  i) for t < 0.

let us study the retarded green function with two eld operators ,(t, t)
dened by (2.120) when we optimize with respect to the initial state. for t > t and with
the time-ordered product :



11 (k,q  k, p1, q  p1, t, t) = z

d3p

(p,p  q, p1, q  p1, t0, t)i

(3.149)

for t > t and the anti-t product :



11 (k,q  k, p1, q  p1, t, t) = z

d3p

(2)3 trhl(p  q,p, k,q  k, t, t0)

(p,p  q, p1, q  p1, t0, t)i

(3.150)
we use formula (3.134) obtained at the rst order in perturbation. the retarded green
function ,(t, t) is given by expression (2.121) obtained by optimizing only the
dynamics and a term equal to :

z
+z

d3p
(2)3 tr[l(p  q,p, k,q  k, t, t0)x(t0, t)]
d3p
(2)3 tr[l(p  q,p, k,q  k, t, t0)x(t0, t)]

(3.151)

where tr[l(t, t0)x(t0, t)] is equal to the term p (1) (eq.
(3.147)). we see from the
expression of p (1) by interchanging t and t that the dierence tr[l(t, t0)x(t0, t)] 
tr[l(t, t0)x(t0, t)] is vanishing.

to conclude, for the the linear response formula which involves the retarded green
functions, we obtain the same result with or without the optimization with respect to
initial state. it is sucient to solve the backward dynamical equations (3.114-3.117) in
real time for l.

4 conclusion

in this paper, we have shown how to derive variational approximations for two-time cor-
relation functions in 4 theory. we have studied in particular the two-time correlation
functions with two eld operators (x) and with four eld operators (x) in the symmetric
phase. by using the variational principle introduced by balian and veneroni [6], we have
shown how to take into account correlations both in the dynamics and in the initial state
while keeping uncorrelated ansatze for the variational objects. the calculation sheme
we have presented is valid for arbitrary time-dependent problems. as an illustration,
we have calculated explicitly the two-time correlation functions with two eld operators
and with four eld operators at equilibrium in the symmetric phase. the approximation
we have obtained for the two eld operators correlation function is identical in this case
with the usual mean-eld result. this wont be true in the asymmetric phase or for a
time-dependent problem. the approximation for the two-time and four eld operators
correlation function contains already in the simple case we have considered corrections to
the standard mean-eld result. for the non-retarded correlation functions, it is important
to optimize with respect to the initial state in order not to obtain a spurious dependence
on the initial time. however, for the retarded correlation functions, the same result is
obtained whether or not we optimize with respect to the initial state. our variational
approximations for the two-time correlation functions satisfy the uctuation-dissipation
theorem. for the four eld operators correlation function, we were obliged to solve the
dynamical equations perturbatively. the zero order approximation was already known
in the litterature but we have shown here how to derive it variationally. we have cal-
culated also the rst order approximation. at zero temperature, it is possible to resum
the perturbative serie and to dene in this way a renormalized coupling constant. we
stress that our approximations remain nonperturbative since they involve a self-consistent
renormalized mass.

there are several important questions for future works. first, how can one obtain
variational approximations which include damping. it would be very interesting to ob-
tain a variational nonperturbative approximation for the viscosity dened in eq. (3.86).
damping eects are probably related to a non symmetrical form in x and y for the matrix
t dened in eq. (2.24) to characterize our gaussian variational ansatze and to a choice
for the operator h dierent from the hamiltonian h. a second interesting problem is the
evolution of a scalar eld in self-interaction in a time-dependent metric. the diculty
in this case is to solve the backward dynamical equations in order to obtain variational

50

approximations for the two-time correlation functions.

i thank also olivier martin for a critical reading of a part of the manuscript.

appendix a : characterization of a gaussian state

we call a gaussian operator an operator which is an exponential of quadratic and
linear forms of the eld operators (x) and (x). a gaussian operator d(t) is completely
characterized by the vector (x, t) and the matrix (x, y, t) dened by the equations
(2.18)-(2.25) of the section 2.3.

instead of the quantities g, t and s, the authors of reference [9] have introduced

the quantities g,  and ,  being the degree of mixing (for a pur state,  = 1) :
