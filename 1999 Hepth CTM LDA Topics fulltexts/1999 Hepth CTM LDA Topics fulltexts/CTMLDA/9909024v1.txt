1 renormalization group primer

1.1 mathematical preliminaries

1.1.1 renorm-group folklore

let us start with some simple statements which can be supposed to be widely known by
particle theorists. in the quantum eld theory (qft) the renormalization group (rg) is
usually associated with a possibility of presenting any physical quantity, f (q2, g), cal-
culated under a denite renormalization prescription in the form f (q2/2, g)
(for
simplicity  in a massless case) with the renormalized coupling constant g denition
attached to some renormalization point (or reference momentum scale) q = . dieren-
tial rg equation is usually said to be driven from the condition that f does not depend
on the choice of  ,

df
d

= 0 .

(1)

the coupling constant g dependence on  is described by a specic function g(q2)

known as an eective coupling (sometimes  eective coupling constant) g = g(2) .

eq.(1) can be written down in the form of a partial linear dierential equation (de)

"x


x  (g)



g# f (x, g) = 0

(2)

where x = q2/2, g stands for g and (g), the group generator, usually referred to as
beta function, is dened by

(g) = z

g(z)

z

at

z = 2 .

the eective coupling g should be considered as a function of two arguments: x =

q2/2 and g with the boundary condition g(1, g) = g. besides

it satises the nonlinear de

"x


x  (g)



g# g(x, g) = 0

x

g(x, g)

x

= (g(x, g))

(3)

(4)

which is nothing else but a characteristic equation for (2). to employ this formalism,
one has to give (g). usually, for this one uses renormalized perturbation theory.

the foregoing can be considered as a rg folklore. for brevity, we gave it in the
simplest massless version, which corresponds to the uv case, for the qft model with
one coupling constant.

1

1.1.2 group functional equation

less popular are the rg functional equations (fes). the fe for the g in the uv case
has the form

g(x, g) = g(cid:18) x

t

, g(t, g)(cid:19) .

(5)

this equation, which follows (see, e.g., the chapter renormalization group in ref.[1])
from nite dyson renormalization transformations, represents a basement of the dieren-
tial rg formulation. popular de (4) can be directly obtained from it by dierentiating
over x and then putting t = x. on the other hand, by dierentiating (5) with respect
to t at t = 1 we get partial de (3).

the fe (5) as well as similar fes for propagators and vertex functions (see, below,
eq.(19)) must be considered as the most compact and general formulation of the rg
symmetry in qft.

however, in reality, group fes, like (5) (and des (4) and (3) as well) do not contain
any physics at all being just the reection of the group composition law! here, we mean
the continuous group (that is, the lie group of transformations) of operations changing
the reference point  involved into the coupling constant g denition. namely, we can
regard the change of a reference coupling g  g as an operation of the group element
tt

ttg = gt = g(t, g)

with a real continuous positive numerical parameter t (= 2/2) .

if we set x =  t, then the l.h.s. of (5) can be achieved from g by operation t t, while
the r.h.s. may be identied as t ttg. the content of eq.(5) is just the group composition
law,

t t = t tt .

thus, the essence of the basic rg functional equation (5) is the necessary condition

for transformations tt to form a group.

at the same time, it demonstrates that function g is invariant with respect to simul-

taneos transformation

invariance condition for an observable now can be written down as

rt

: { x = x/t , g = g(t, g)} .
f (x, g) = f (cid:18) x
, g(t, g)(cid:19) .

t

(6)

usually, of interest are also functions (x, g) (like, e.g., propagator amplitudes in

qft) transforming as a linear representation of rg

(x, g)  rt = (x, g) = z(t, g)(x, g) .

(7)

note also that the group fe for an observable, like matrix element, is of the form

m({x}, y; g) = m (cid:18)(cid:26)x
t(cid:27) ,

y
t

, g(t, y; g)(cid:19) ; {x} = x1, x2, . . . , xk

(8)

which reects an existence of several q2-type arguments and implements its indepen-
dence of renormalization details corresponding to eq.(1).

2

1.1.3 abstract formulation

to make this point clearer, let us show that fe (5) can formally be obtained directly
from the group composition law. generally, the mathematical formulation of the rg
transformation can be presented as a functional realization of the mentioned lie group.
consider the transformation t (l) of a certain abstract set m of elements mi into
( < l < ) such that for each

itself depending on a continuous real parameter l
element m we have

t (l)m = m (m, m  m) .

suppose that m can be projected onto the real axis, i.e., for every mi there corresponds
a real number gi

1. then, this transformation can be written in the analytic form

t (l)g = g = g(l, g) ,

g being a continuous function of two arguments satisfying the normalization condition
g(0, g) = g which corresponds to the identity transformation t (0) = e.

transformations t (l) form a group if they satisfy the composition law

to which there corresponds the functional equation for g :

t (l)  t () = t (l + )

g{l, g(, g)} = g(l + , g) .

(9)

(10)

as it follows from the bases of the lie group theory, it is sucient to deal with the
innitesimal transformation at   1 , i.e., with the de

g(l, g)

l

= {g(l, g)} .

(11)

here the group generator is dened as

(g) =

g(, g)



at

 = 0.

performing a logarithmic change of variables

l = ln x,

 = ln t , g(l, g) = g(x, g) , t (ln t) = tt

(12)

we obtain (5) and (4) instead of (10) and (11).

1this condition is not essential and can be modied  see, below, eqs. (16) and (17).

1.2 denition of the renorm-group

1.2.1 the rg transformation

generally, the rg can be dened as a continuous one-parameter group of specic trans-
formations of a partial solution (or the solution characteristic) of a problem, a solution
that is xed by a boundary condition. the rg transformation involves boundary condi-
tion parameters and corresponds to some change in the way of imposing this condition.
for illustration, imagine an one-argument solution characteristic f (x) that has to
be specied by the boundary condition f (x0) = f0. formally, represent the given char-
acteristic of a partial solution as a function of boundary parameters as well: f (x) =
f (x, x0, f0). (this step can be considered as an embedding operation). the rg trans-
formation then corresponds to a changeover of the way of parameterization, say from
{x0, f0} to {x1, f1} for the same solution. in other words, the x argument value, at which
the boundary condition is given, does not need to be x0, but we may choose another
point xi. our solution f can be written in a form of a two-argument function f (x/x0, f0)
with the property f (1, ) = . the equality f (x/x0, f0) = f (x/x1, f1) reects the fact
that under such a change of a boundary condition the form of function f itself is not
modied (as, e.g., in the case of f (x, ) = (ln x + )). noting that f1 = f (x1/x0, f0) ,
we obtain

f (, f0) = f (/t, f (t, f0)) ;

 = x/x0 , t = x1/x0 .

the group transformation here is {   /t, f0  f1 = f (t, f0) } .

the renorm-group transformation for a given solution of some physical problem in the

simplest case can be dened as

a simultaneous one-parameter transformation of two variables, say x and g, by

rt

: { x  x = x/t , g  g = g(x, g) } ,

(6)

the rst being a scaling of a coordinate x and the second  a more complicated functional
transformation of the solution characteristics. eq.(5) for the transformation function g
provides the group property t t = t tt of the transformation (6). performing the loga-
rithmic change of variables and an appropriate redenition of a transformation function
(12), we obtain eqs.(10), (11) and

r(l)

: { q  q = q  l , g  g = g(l, g) } ,

(13)

instead of (5), (4) and (6). one can refer to these equations as the multiplicative version
(and previous equations in abstract formulation as to the additive one). they are just the
rg equations and transformation for a massless qft model with one coupling constant.
in that case x = q2/2 is the ratio of a 4-momentum q squared to a normalization
momentum  squared and g, the coupling constant.

several generalizations of (6) and (13) will be considered below.

4

1.2.2

simple generalizations

massive case

for example in qft, if we do not neglect the mass m of a particle, we have to insert
an additional dimensionless argument into the invariant coupling g which now has to be
considered as a function of three variables: x = q2/2, y = m2/2, and g. the presence
of a new mass argument y modies the group transformation

rt

: (cid:26)x =

x
t

, y =

y
t

, g = g(t, y; g) (cid:27)

and the functional equation

g(x, y; g) = g(cid:18) x

t

,

y
t

; g(t, y; g)(cid:19) .

(14)

(15)

here, it is important that the new parameter y (which in physical nature must be close
to the x variable as it scales similarly) enters also into the transformation law of g .

if the considered qft model, like qcd, contains several masses there will be several

mass arguments

y  {y} = y1, y2, . . . yn .

multi-coupling case
a more complicated generalization corresponds to transition to the case with several
coupling constants: g  {g} = g1, . . . gk . here, one has to introduce the family of
eective couplings

g  {g} , gi = gi(x, y;{g}) ;

i = 1, 2, . . . k ,

satisfying the system of coupled functional equations

gi(x, y;{g}) = gi(cid:18)x

t

,

y
t

; { g(t, y;{g}) } (cid:19) .

(16)

in the abstract formulation this system is a generalization of (5) and (15) for the case
when every element mi of m can be described by k numerical parameters, i.e., by a
point {g} in the k-dimensional real parameter space. the rg transformation now is

rt

: (cid:26) x 

x
t

, y 

y
t

, {g}  {g(t)} (cid:27) , gi(t) = gi(t, y;{g}) .

(17)

1.3 early history and the rg method

1.3.1 renormalization and renormalization invariance

as it is known, the regular formalism for eliminating the uv divergences in qft was
developed on the basis of covariant perturbation theory for the scattering smatrix in
the late 40s. this breakthrough is connected with the names of tomonaga, feynman,

5

schwinger and some others.
in particular, dyson and abdus salam carried out the
general analysis of the structure of divergences in arbitrarily high orders of perturbation
theory. nevertheless, a number of subtle questions concerning overlapping divergences
remained unclear.

an important contribution in this direction based on a thorough analysis of the
mathematical nature of uv divergences was made by bogoliubov. this was achieved on
the basis of a branch of mathematics which was new at that time, namely, the sobolev
schwartz
theory of distributions. the point is, that propagators in local qft are
distributions (similar to the dirac deltafunction) and propagator products appearing
in the coecients of the smatrix expansion require a supplementary denition in the
case when their arguments coincide and lie on the light cone.

in the mid 50s on the basis of this approach bogoliubov and his disciples developed a
technique of supplementing the denition of products of singular stuckelbergfeynman
propagators [2] and proved a theorem [3] on the niteness and uniqueness (for renor-
malizable theories) of the smatrix elements in any order of perturbation theory. the
prescriptive part of this theorem, the bogoliubov r-operation (see, e.g., chapter removal
of divergencies from the smatrix in the monograph [1]), still remains a practical means
of obtaining nite and unique results in the higher order perturbation calculation.

the bogoliubov algorithm works, essentially, as follows:
 to remove the uv divergences of a one-loop diagram, instead of introducing some
regularization, e.g., the momentum cuto, and handling (quasi) innite counterterms, it
suces to complete the denition of a divergent feynman integral by subtracting from
it a certain polynomial in the external momenta which in the simplest case is reduced
to the rst few terms of the taylor series.

 for multi-loop diagram (including one with overlapping divergences) one should
rst subtract all divergent subdiagrams and nish with subtracting the diagram as a
whole in a hierarchical order regulated by the roperator.

an attractive feature of this approach is that it is free from any auxiliary nonphysical
attributes such as bare masses, bare coupling constants, and regularization parameters
which are not involved in the computation within the bogoliubovs algorithm. the latter
can be regarded as renormalization without regularization and counterterms.

the uniqueness of computational results for the observable s-matrix elements is
ensured by special conditions imposed on them. these conditions contain some degree
of freedom (related to dierent renormalization schemes and momentum scales) that
can be used to establish nite relations between the lagrangian parameters (masses,
coupling constants) and corresponding renormalized quantities. the fact that physical
predictions are independent of arbitrariness in the renormalization conditions, that is,
they are renorminvariant, constitutes the conceptual foundation of the renormalization
group.

6

1.3.2 the discovery of the renormalization group

in the 1952-1953 stuckelberg and peterman [5] discovered2 a group of innitesimal trans-
formations related to nite arbitrariness arising in the s-matrix elements upon elimina-
tion of the uv divergences. these authors introduced normalization group generated by
lie operators connected with renormalization of the coupling constant e.

in the following year, on the basis of (innite) dysons renormalization transfor-
mations formulated in the regularized form, gell-mann and low [6] derived functional
equations for the qed propagators in the uv limit. the appendix to this article con-
tains the general solution (obtained by t.d. lee) of this functional equation for the
renormalized transverse photon propagator amplitude d(x, e2), written in two equiva-
lent forms:

e2d(cid:16)x, e2(cid:17) = f (cid:16)xf 1(cid:16)e2(cid:17)(cid:17)

and

ln x =

, (e2) =

(18)

(e2d)

 ln x (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=1

a qualitative analysis of the behaviour of the quantum electromagnetic interaction at
small distances was carried out with the aid of (18). two possibilities, namely, innite
and nite charge renormalizations were pointed out.

however, paper [6] paid no attention to the group character of the analysis and the
results obtained there. the authors missed a chance to establish a connection between
their results and the standard perturbation theory and did not discuss the possibility
that a ghost pole solution might exist.

the nal step was taken by bogoliubov and the present author bs-55a,bs-55b,sh-55
 see also the survey [10] published in english in 1956. using the group properties of
nite dyson transformations for the coupling constant, elds and green functions, these
authors derived functional group equations for the propagators and vertices in qed in
the general case (that is, with the electron mass taken into account). for example, the
equation for the transverse amplitude of the photon propagator and electron propagator
amplitude were obtained in the form

d(x, y; e2) = d(t, y; e2) d(cid:18)x
s(x, y; e2) = s(t, y; e2) s(cid:18)x

; e2d(t, y; e2)(cid:19)

(19)

in which the dependence on the mass variable y = m2/2 was present.

as can be seen, the product e2d of electron charge squared and photon propagator
amplitude enters in both the fes. this product is invariant with respect to dysons
transformation. we called this function  invariant charge and introduced the term
renormalization group.

2 for a more detailed exposition of the rg early history see our review [4].

7

in the modern notation, the rst equation is that for the invariant charge (now widely

known as an eective or running coupling)  = d(x, y;  = e2):

(x, y; ) = (cid:18)x

t

,

y
t

; (t, y; )(cid:19) .

(20)

let us emphasize that, unlike the approach ref.[6], in the latter case there is no
relation with uv divergences and simplication due to the massless nature of the uv
asymptotics. here, the homogeneity of the transfer momentum scale is violated explic-
itly by mass m. nevertheless, the symmetry (even though a bit more complex one)
underlying the rg, as before, can be stated as an exact symmetry of the solutions of the
qft problem. this is what we mean when using the term bogoliubovs renormalization
group or renorm-group for short.

(22)

were rst derived in [7] by dierentiating the fes. in this way, explicit realization of
the group des mentioned in the paper [5] was obtained. these results established a
conceptual link with the stuckelbergpeterman and gell-mannlow results.

1.3.3 creation of the rg method

another important achievement of paper [7] consisted in formulating a simple algorithm
for improving an approximate perturbative solution by combining it with the lie equa-
tions (for detail, see below, section 2).

in our adjacent publication [8] this algorithm was eectively used to analyse the uv

and infrared (ir) behaviour in qed. the one-loop and two-loop uv asymptotics

rg(x, 0, ) =

(24)

(25)

of the electron propagator in the transverse gauge were obtained. at that time, these
expressions were already known only at the oneloop level. it should be noted that in
the mid 50s the problem of the uv behaviour in local qft was quite urgent. at that
time, substantial progress in the analysis of qed at small distances was made by landau

8

and his collaborators [11]. however, landaus approach did not provide a prescription
for constructing subsequent approximations.

the simple technique for obtaining higher approximations was found only within the
new renormgroup method. the one-loop uv asymptotics of qed propagators obtained
in our paper [8], eqs. (23) and (25), agreed precisely with the results of landaus group.
within the rg approach these results can be obtained in just a few lines of argu-
mentation. to this end, e.g., the massless one-loop perturbation approximation should
be substituted into the r.h.s. of the rst equation in (22) to compute the generator
(0, ) = () = 2/3 followed by elementary integration of the rst of eqs.(21).

moreover, starting from the next order perturbation expression (2)

p t h(x, ; ) con-
taining the 3 ln x term, we arrived at the second renorm-group approximation (24)
performing summation of the 2( ln)n terms. this two-loop solution for the invariant
coupling rst obtained in [8] contains the nontrivial logoflog dependence which is now
widely known of the next-to-leadind logs approximation for the running coupling in
quantum chromodynamics (qcd)  see, below, eq.(47).

comparing solution (24) with (23), one can conclude that the two-loop correction is
extremely essential just in the vicinity of the ghost pole singularity at x1 = exp (3/).
this demonstrates that the rg method is a regular procedure, within which it is quite
easy to estimate the range of applicability of the results.

quite soon, this approach was formulated [9] for the case of qft with two coupling
constants, say, g and h, namely, for a model of pionnucleon interactions with the pions
self-interaction. to the system of functional equations for two invariant couplings

g2(cid:16)x, y; g2, h(cid:17) = g2(cid:18)x

analysed [12] in the one-loop appriximation to carry out the uv analysis of the renor-
malizable model of the pion-nucleon interaction.

in a more general case of arbitrary covariant gauge the rg analysis in qed was
carried out in [13]. here, the point was that the charge renormalization is connected
only with the transverse part of the photon propagator. therefore, under nontransverse
covariant (e.g., feynman) gauge the dyson transformation has a more complex form.
this issue has been resolved by considering the gauge parameter as another coupling
constant.

in refs.[7, 8, 9, 13] and [12] the rg was thus directly connected with practical
computations of the uv and ir asymptotics. since then this technique, known as the
renormalization group method (rgm) and being summarized in the rst edition of
monograph [1], has become the sole means of asymptotic analysis in local qft.

1.4.1 eective electron charge

an essential feature of quantum theory is the presence of virtual states and transitions.
in qed, e.g., the process of virtual dissociation of a photon into an electron-positron
pair and vice versa   e+ + e can take place. the sequence of two such virtuale
transitions represents the simplest contribution to the eect of vacuum polarization.
the vacuum polarization processes lead to several specic phenomena and partic-
ularly to the notion of eective electron charge. to explain this, let us start with a
classical analogy.

take a polarizable medium consisting of molecules that can be imagined as electric
dipoles. insert into it an external electric charge q. due to the attraction of opposite
charges, the dipoles change their position so that the charge q turns out to be partially
screened. as a result, at a distance r from q the electric potential will be smaller than
the vacuum coulomb law q/r and can be presented in the form q(r)/r where, generally,
q(r)  q. the introduced quantity q(r) is known as an eective charge. as r decreases,
q(r) increases and as r  0, q(r) tends to q.
in qft the vacuum, i.e., the interparticle space itself stands for the polarizable
medium. quantumeld vacuum is not physically empty.
it is lled with vacuum
uctuations, i.e., with virtual particles. these zero uctuations are a well-known
eect of a ground state in quantum world. in qed, zero oscillations consist mainly of
short-lived virtual (e+, e) pairs which play the role of tiny electric dipoles.

consider the process of measuring the electron charge with the help of some external
electromagnetic eld.
in the quantum case the probing photon can virtually dissoci-
ate into the (e+, e) pair. this pair can be treated as a virtual dipole that produces
partial screening of the measured charge. the simplest process involves two elementary
electromagnetic interactions, its contribution to an eective charge being proportional
to the small number e2    1/137; and this contribution depends on the distance
in the region of r values much smaller than the compton length of the electron
r !

(26)

as was rst discussed by dirac [14] in the middle of the 30s. the e(r) value decreases as
r grows. so, qualitatively, the qed eective charge behavior corresponds to a classical
picture of screening.

this dependence can be presented by a set of curves e(r). each curve represents a
possible behavior of the eective charge e(r) as obtained from the theory and considered
without any reference to experiment ( = e2 being unspecied numerically).

the point is that in the classical analogue the value of an external charge q inserted
into the polarizable medium is known from the very beginning. in quantum physics it
is not the case, and a charge value can be measured at not very small distances. the
result of measurement generally has to be specied by two quantities: the distance of
measurement ri and the measured charge value ei. hence, to make the choice from
the mentioned set of curves, one has to x the point on the plane with the coordinates

10

r = ri, e(r) = ei. thus, for the chosen physical curve e(ri) = ei. note, that the usual
denition of the electron charge by a classical macroscopic (like millikan) experiment

corresponds here to very large distances r  re, i.e., e = e(r = re) = 1/137.

as it is well known, in relativistic microphysics one usually uses the momentum rather
than coordinate representation. correspondingly, instead of e(r) one deals with the
quantity (q2), the fourier transform of e(r) squared. it is a monotonically increasing
function of its argument q2, the 4-momentum transfer squared. here and below, the bar
denotes a function (distinct from , , i  its numerical values at some given value of
the q2 argument). the correspondence condition with the classical electrodynamics now
takes the form (0) = 1/137, as in our scale the external long-range eld corresponds to
a photon with vanishing 4-momentum. however, as before, to x one of possible curves

on the plane (q, ) one has to give a point q  q2 = ,  =  and hence, for the

selected curve (2) = .

the parameter  sometimes is referred to as a scale parameter. as is clear, it is just
the momentum magnitude for a photon used for the charge measurement. the eective
coupling function (q2) describes the dependence of the electron charge value on the
measurement conditions. in our days the logarithmic corrections to the millikan value
become essential and are measured at big accelerators.

the parameter  has no analogue in the qed lagrangian that reproduces the clas-
sical electrodynamical one. the phenomenon of its arising in qft was exaggerated by
the term dimensional transmutation. as it was shown, its appearance is very natural
and is connected with the measurement procedure.

this is a good place to recall the ideas by niels bohr formulated in the middle of
30s [15] and related to the complementarity principle. the point is that to specify a
quantum system, it is necessary to x its macroscopic surrounding, i.e., to give the
properties of macroscopic devices used in the measurement process. just these devices
are described by additional parameters, like . however, this is not the end of the bohr
(i.e.  scale) parameter story. as can be shown, in the qft this parameter existence
leads to a new symmetry lying in the foundation of the renormalization group.

1.4.2 rg transformations

to do this, consider again the function (q2) having in mind that the physical solution
has been chosen by the condition (q2 = 2) = . assume also for simplicity that
we deal with a massless qed, more precisely, with the approximation | q | m. this
corresponds to the gev-energy region or to distances r  re. here the eective charge
function  can be represented as a function of two dimensionless arguments q2/2 and
, i.e., (q2) = (q2/2, ) .

now, take into account that the couple of parameters ,  used to identify the
physical solution may, generally, correspond to any scale . take two scales 1 and 2
with coordinates 1, 1 and 2, 2, respectively. it is evident that  can be parameterized
by any pair i, i; i = 1, 2, . . .

so that for arbitrary q2 values the identity

(q2/2

1, 1) = (q2/2

2, 2)

11

should hold.

at the same time the second argument in the r.h.s., 2, which by denition is equal
2, can be expressed in terms of  parameterized with the help of point
1, 1) . combining the last two relations

to  at q2 = 2
1 coordinates, i.e., 2 = (q2 = 2
and introducing a notation q2/2 = x, 1 = , 2

1 = t , we arrive at the fe

2) = (2

2/2

2/2

(x, ) = (

x

, (t, )),

(27)

identical with eq.(5).

note, that the corresponding continuous one-parameter transformation is just the

change (1  2) of the parameterization point

rt : {1  2 = t1, 1  2 = (t, 1)} .

(28)

thus, we have shown that in the renormalized qed there exists invariance with
respect to continuous transformations of the group type which involve two quantities
and contain a functional dependence. this precisely corresponds to denition (6).

as can be shown, in qed the eective coupling  is equal to a product of  and
dimensionless function d(x, )  the transverse photon propagator amplitude with due
regard for vacuum polarization eects. generally, in qft models with one coupling
constant the invariant coupling g(x, g) can be expressed as a product of g, corresponding
vertex function and the square root of propagator amplitudes of the elds participating
in the interaction. usually, this can be done on the basis of dyson nite renormalization
transformations.

thus, the rg invariance is nothing else but the invariance of a solution with respect
to the way of its parameterization. for instance, in real qed, instead of using the
millikans value (0) = 1/137 one may take the cern value (m 2
z)  1/128, 9.

2 renormalization group method

2.1 basic idea

approximate solution of the physical problems with rg symmetry usually does not
obey this symmetry which is lost in the course of approximation. this is essential when
the solution under consideration posseses a singularity as far as the singularity structure
commonly is destroyed by an approximation.

in qft, e.g., the usual way of calculation is based on the perturbation method, i.e.,
it is not dicult to see that nite sums of this expansion
on power expansion in g.
do not satisfy the functional group equations. as the simplest illustration, consider the
eective coupling g in the uv region where the one-loop contribution has a logarithmic
form

g(1)
pth(x, g) = g + g2 ln x

(29)

12

with , a numerical coecient. by substituting this expression into fe (5), after simple
manipulation one has

discr[g(1)

pt(cid:16)x/t, g(1)

pt(t, g)(cid:17) =

pt]  g(1)

pt(x, g)  g(1)

= [g + g2 ln x]  [g + g2 ln x + 2g32 ln t ln(x/t)] 6= 0

 error in the g3 order. this discrepancy can be liquidated by addition of the particular
next order term to the r.h.s. of (29)

g(2)
pt = g + g2 ln x + g32 ln2 x.

this improved expression would yield the discrepancy of the g4 order which in its

turn can be abolished by adding the g4 ln3 term to (29) and so on.

thus, we see, on the one hand, that the nite polynomials cannot satisfy the condition
of renormalization invariance. on the other hand, we can conclude that the functional
rg equation represents a tool for iterative reconstruction of renorm-invariant expression
that has the form of innite series.

this example illustrates a rather general situation. as a rule, approximate solutions
do not satisfy a group symmetry. here, this happens in the uv limit as ln x   where
the observed discrepancy becomes important.
another illustration is provided by the one-dimensional transfer problem (for detail,
see our reviews in refs. [16]). take a half-space (l > 0) lled with a homogenious media.
let some given amount of particles (or radiation) be falling on the surface (at l = 0)
from the empty half-space. the particle density n(l, v) is a function of coordinate and
of particle velocity v.
it satises an integrodierential kinetic boltzmann equation.
in some cases one can neglect by the energy dependence of crosssections. here, the
solution can be treated as a function of coordinate and direction of particle velocity
 = v/v. in this, one-velocity, case the simple symmetry of the rg type was found
not for density, but for n integrated over directions in forward hemisphere

g(l) = z+

n(l, )d .

the function g relates to amount of all particles moving inwards the media. a par-
tial solution of this problem will depend on the boundary condition at l = 0. corre-
spondingly, the solution characteristic g will be the function of two arguments g(l, g)
 coordinate l (distance from the boundary) and total amount of ingoing particles
g = g(l = 0) = g(0, g). just this function g(l, g) satises [17] the group fe (10)
in the additive form.

it is rather simple to get an approximate behavior of this density g(l, g), at small l

g(l, g) = g + lg(0, g),

l  1,

(30)

which, being considered for large l values, also does not obey the mentioned symmetry.

13

on this basis one can set the task of renormalization-invariant improvement of
perturbative results. the key idea is to combine an approximate solution with the
group equations. the simplest and most convenient way for this marriage is the use
of lie equations, i.e., group dierential equations. the renormalization group method
(rgm) as it was rst formulated in refs.[7, 8, 10] is essentially based on these group
equations.

2.2 dierential formulation

the dierential equations can be obtained from the functional ones in two dierent ways.
dierentiating eq.(15) by x and putting then t = x , one obtains (compare with (4)):

x

g(x, y, g)

x

= (cid:18) y

x

, g(x, y; g)(cid:19) ,

(y, g) =

g(t, y; g)

t

.

(22a)

the nonlinear equation (22a) can be considered as massive generalization of eq.(4).
on the other hand, one can dierentiate eq.(15) with respect to t at the point t = 1,
which yields

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1


y  (y, g)
a linear partial dierential equation (pde).


x

+ y

"x



g# g(x, y; g) = 0 ,

analogous operations applied to the second of eqs.(19) lead to:

is the so-called anomalous dimension of s. for a group invariant, like, e.g., matrix
element m satisfying fe (8) this dimension is equal to zero. the corresponding pde
looks like

(xi

y  (y, g)

equations (31), (32), and (34) express the independence on the t parameter of the
r.h.s. of the related functional group equations, i.e., a mutual compensation of t depen-
dences via three (or more) arguments. this des can be called compensational equations
to distinguish them from nonlinear eqs.(21) which can be referred to as evolutional group
equations.

stress that compensational as well as evolutional des taken together with normaliza-
tion (i.e. boundary) conditions like g(1, g) = g , s(1, g) = 1 are equivalent to functional

equations and to each other. at the same time, evolutional lie equations turn out to be
more convenient for practical construction of the solution, generators ,  being given.

let us comment also that the uv limit of compensational des like, e.g.,

(x


x  (g)



g  (g)) s(x, g) = 0

coincides with the uv limit of specic nonclosed equation

(x


x  (g)



g  (g)) s(x, g) = s

(35)

(c  s)

obtained in the early 70s by callan and symansik. the r.h.s. of this equation contains
the result of mass counter-term insertion into all internal lines of all diagrams for the
function s under consideration. for this reason, in current literature compensational
equations are often related to as the callansymansik equations. however, these equa-
tions just in the form (31) and (32) were rst obtained by lev ovsyannikov in 1956
while solving [18] functional rg equations. therefore, we consider it justiable to relate
compensational des to the ovsyannikovs rather than to some other names.

it is not dicult to formulate group des for a multi-coupling case by proper dier-

entiation of fes (16). for instance, the system of evolutional des looks like

x

gi(x, y,{g})

x

= i(cid:18) y

x

,{ gj(x, y;{g})}(cid:19) .

(36)

2.3 general solution

general solution of the group fes was obtained in the paper [18] by applying the theory
of pde to the compensational eqs. (31) and (32). details of the derivation can be found
in the section 48.3 of the third edition of the monograph [1]. the results obtained can
be formulated as follows:

to every solution of de (31), there corresponds some function of two arguments
f (y, g), reversible with respect to its second argument and connected to g by the relation

f (y, g) = f (cid:18) y

x

, g(x, y; g)(cid:19) .

(37)

the explicit form of g can be obtained now by reversing the r.h.s:

g(x, y, g) = f 1

(2) (cid:20) y

x

, f (y, g)(cid:21) .

to determine f it is sucient to specify the generator (y, g).

note also that to get from the ovsyannikov result (37) the solution in the uv limit,

i.e., in a massless case at y = 0, one has to assume for f a specic limiting form

f (y, g) = y exp[f (g)] or = ln y + f (g) as

y  0 .

15

then

f{g(x, g)}  f (g) = ln x ;

g = f1{ln x + f (g)} .

(38)

here, f(g) = 1/(g). this is equivalent to the gell-mannlowlee solution (18).
to every solution of eq.(19) for a function s, there corresponds some function (y, g)

related to s by

s(x, y; g) =

[y/x, g(x, y; g)]

(y, g)

.

(39)

let us give also the general solution of the same type for the system (16) for the k-
couplings case. it can be written down in terms of k arbitrary functions fi, reversible
simultaneously with respect to last arguments, and dened from the system of k func-
tional relations

fi(y,{g}) = fi(cid:20) y

x

, {g(x, y;{g})}(cid:21) , {g} = g1, ... gk ; i, j = 1, ... k .

(40)

all solutions (37)  (40) satisfy the usual normalization conditions.
the transition to the massless limit in expressions (39)  (40) can be performed by

a trick analogous to the given above. then, e.g.,

s(x, g) = x {g(x, g)}

(g)

.

let us also formulate solution for the 2-coupling case g1 = g, g2 = h in the massless

limit in the form analogous to (38)

fi(g, h) = fi(g, h) + ln x,

i = 1, 2 .

(41)

from the solutions presented it follows that imposing group symmetry one reduces

by unity the number of independent arguments.

2.4 rgm algorithm

2.4.1 technology of rg method

the idea of the approximate solution marriage [7, 8] with group symmetry can be realised
with help of group des.
if we dene group generators ,  from some approximate
solutions and then solve evolutional des, we obtain rg improved solutions that obey
the group symmetry and correspond to the approximate solutions used as an input.

now we can formulate an algorithm of improving an approximate solution. the
procedure is given by the following recipe which we illustrate by a massless onecoupling
case (4) and (5):

assume some approximate solution gappr is known.
1. on the basis of eq.(22a) dene the beta-function

(g) def=




gappr(, g)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=1

16

.

(42)

2. integrate eq.(4), i.e., construct the function

3. resolve the eq.(38)

f (g) def= z g d

()

,

grg(x, g) = f1{f (g) + ln x} .

(43)

(44)

4. then, the solution grg, precisely satises the rg symmetry, i.e., it is an exact

solution of eq.(5) and corresponds to gappr .

for illustration, take as a gappr the simplest perturbative expression (29) for the

invariant coupling. here, the -function is (g) = 1g2 , and the integration yields

the solution obtained

z g

g

dg
(g)

g! = ln x .

g(x, g) =

g

1 + g1 ln x

,

(45)

one one hand, exactly satises the rg symmetry and, on the other, being expanded in
powers of g, correlates with the input (29).

2.4.2 rgm usage in qft

as it has been explained above in section 2.1, the qft perturbation expression of
nite order does not obey the rg symmetry. on the other hand, in section 2.4.1 it
was shown that the one-loop uv approximation for g used as an input in eq.(22) for
the construction of a group generator (g) yields expression (45) that obeys the group
symmetry and exactly satises fe (5).

now, using the geometric progression (45) as a hint, let us represent the 2-loop

perturbative approximation for g in the form
gpt = g  g21 ln x + g3 [2

1 ln2 x  2 ln x] + o(g4) ,

where 1 and 2 mean the  -function coecients at the one-loop and two-loop level,
respectively. if we substitute this expression into eq.(5) we obtain

g(2)
pt (x, g)  g(2)

1 ln(x/t) ln2 t .

pt (x/t; g(2)

pt (t, g)) = g43

meanwhile, we can use g(2)

pt as an input in eq.(42). now the step 1 yields

and then (step 2)

(2)(g) = 1g2  2g3

1f (2)(z) = z z

d

2 + b3 =

1
z

+ b ln

z

1 + bz

;

b =

2
1

.

(46)

17

to make the last step, we have to start with the equation

f (2)[g(2)

rg (x, g)] = f (2)(g) + 1 ln x

which is a transcendental one and has no simple explicit solution3. due to this, one has
to resolve this relation approximately. take into account that the second, logarithmic,
contribution to f (2)(z) in (46) is a small correction to the rst one at bz  1. under
this reservation we can substitute the one-loop rg expression (45) instead of g(2)
rg into
this correction and obtain the explicit expression

g(2)
rg =

g

1 + g1l + g(2/1) ln [1 + g1l]

;

l = ln x.

(47)

this result (rst obtained [8] in mid-50s) is interesting in several aspects.
first, being expanded in g and gl powers, it produces an innite series containing
leading, i.e.  g(gl)n, and next-to-leading  g2(gl)n uv logarithmic contributions.
second, it contains a nontrivial analytic dependence

ln(1 + g1l)  ln(ln q2)

which is absent the in perturbation input. third, being compared with eq.(45), it
demonstrates algorithm of subsequent improving of accuracy, .e., of rgm regularity.

now we can resume the rgm properties. the rgm is a regular procedure of combin-
ing dynamical information (taken from an approximate solution) with the rg symmetry.
the essence of rgm is the following:
1) the mathematical tool used in rgm is lie dierential equations.
2) the key element of rgm is possibility of (approximate) determination of group
generators from dynamics.
3) the rgm works eectively in the case when a solution has a singular behaviour. it
restores the structure of singularity compatible with rg symmetry.

3 rg in qft

this section is devoted, mainly, to general topics of rg applications in the qft short
distance asymptotic behavior. we discuss the specic features of uv analysis connected
with use of perturbation theory, in particular, reliability of results.

3.1 uv analysis in general

3it can be expressed in terms of a special, lambert, w -function : w (z) expw (z) = z; see, e.g., [19].

18

3.1.1 one-coupling case

general analysis of the uv asymptotic behavior for the one-coupling qft model can
be performed rather simply on the basis of the solution

z g(x,g)

(48)

of the massless rg equation (4) for an eective coupling with g = g(1, g) and , a
reference point. as follows from it, the asymptotics at ln x   corresponds to the
divergence at the upper limit of the l.h.s.
integral. depending on the feature of the
function the resultant uv behaviour of the invariant coupling g diers very much.

suppose that at very small g values the beta-function is positive. then, three cases

are possible :

a) consider rst the situation with

z g

(52a)

corresponding to the case when the betafunction has a zero at some nite point g .
here, the uv asymptotic value of eective coupling is nite g(, g) = g <  ,
using the terminology of des qualitative theory, one can say that at g = g we have

which relates to the nite renormalization of the coupling constant: z = g(, g)/g.
a uv xed point.

if at g = g there is a rst order zero (g)  b(g  g) , then eq.(52a) gives

g(x, g)  g  c expb ln x = c(q2/2)b as q2   ,
i.e., in the vicinity of a xed point we have an asymptotic power regime.

b) if (g) is (monotonically) increasing as g   but gentler than g2, so that

z

then the eective coupling tends to innity

alent to g = .

the theory has an inner contradiction, as far as

g(x, g) =  at x < 

and the momentum region x > x can not be described by the theory. we encounter
here a ghost trouble, as explained below in this section.

up to now we have assumed that the generator (g) is positive. in the opposite case

d) (g) = b(g) < 0 one has to deal with the equation

z g

b(z)

and study possible divergence of the integral involved at the lower limit.

if this occurs at some nite value g = g , the situation is quite analogous to the
case b). the only dierence is that now the eective coupling tends to its limiting value
g from above.

as the most important case, we consider the possibility when the singularity lies at
the origin (0) = 0 which happens in qcd. then, g vanishes g(, g) = 0 in the uv
limit which corresponds to the asymptotic freedom phenomenon. e.g., if we assume here
that (g) = 1g2 at g  0 , then
g(x, g)

3.1.2 multi-coupling case

for the quantum eld model with several coupling constants one has to consider the
system of coupled functional (16) or dierential equations. the last ones can be analyzed
by the well-known methods of the qualitative theory of dierential equations.

take the case with two coupling constants g and h. the system of evolutional

dierential equations is

g = g(g, h) ,

f  f / ;  = ln x .
according to (41), the general solution to this system is of the form

h = h(g, h) ;

(52)

f (g, h) = f (g, h) +  ,

(g, h) = (g, h) +  .

where f and   two arbitrary reversible functions.

as far as argument l = ln x does not enter explicitly into the generators g and h,

it can formally be excluded by dividing one of the equations (52) by the other :

dg
dh

= f (g, h),

f =

g
h

.

(53)

this equation can be analyzed on the two dimensional phase plane (g, h).

20

first explicit example of such phase portrait has been obtained in mid-fties by
i. ginzburg [12]  see also section 51.4 in the third edition of the monograph [1].
the essential features are now singular points and singular solutions. singular points
correspond to i = 0 (or = ). they can be of dierent types: a stable xed point that
is known as attractor, an unstable xed point and a saddle-type point. in the vicinity
of the uv attractor one can have a power scaling behavior as in eq.(50). singular
solution, separatrix, joins singular points and can also be stable or unstable. generally,
the unstable ones separate the parts of phase plane with dierent uv asymptotes that
correspond to uv stable separatrices.

3.2 perturbative approach to the uv asymptote

3.2.1

structure of rg results

consider a general situation with the rg approach to the uv asymptotic behavior based
on perturbation calculation input.
in the one-coupling qft case, group generators
entering into des can be written as

(g) = 1g2 + 2g3 + . . .

,

(g) = 1g + 2g2 + . . . .

(54)

generally, expansion coecients depend on the mass variable

(y, g) = xl1

1(y)gl+1 ,

(y, g) = xl

l(y)gl .

(55)

note that if g is just the smatrix expansion parameter (that can be equal to the
coupling constant or to its square) then usually the rst term in expansion for  is
quadratic and for   linear, as it is explicitly indicated above.

substituting (54) into (48), and re-expanding the ratio 2/(), we obtain after

integration

1
2

ln(g/g)  b3(g  g) + 0(g2, g2) = 1 ln x ,
1/g  1/g 
ln s(x, g) = (1/1) ln{g(x, g)/g} + c2(g  g) + 0(g2) ,
b3 = 3/1  (2/1)2,
c2 = [2/1](2/1  2/1).

(56)

(57)

as follows, the solutions g and s depend on two arguments g and g ln x . by expanding

them in powers of g we get

g(x, g) = gf1(g ln x)+g2f2(g ln x)+. . . ,

ln s(x, g) = 1(g ln x)+g2(g ln x)+. . .

(58)

where fj and i have a simple form. for example, f1(z) = (1  1z)1, 1(z)  f2(z) 
ln f1(z) .

comparing expressions obtained with usual perturbative expansions

gpt(x, g) = g + g21 ln x + g3[2

1 ln x + 2 ln x] + 0(g4),

21

spt(x, g) = 1 + g1 ln x + g2[(11/2) ln2 x + 2 ln x] + 0(g3) ,

used as an input to obtain our starting generators, one can see the qualitative eect
of the rgm using. in the case considered, it changes the region of applicability of the
perturbation method limited by the condition g ln x  1 to a more larger region dened
by two relations
(59)

the second of which is dening.

g  1 ,

g(x, g)  1,

3.2.2 the ghost-pole trouble

turn now to the one-loop rg approximation for the eective coupling g, considered in
the uv, i.e., massless limit. according to (45) and (23), it has the form

g(1)(x, g) =

g

1  1g ln x

.

let the numerical coecient 1 be positive. such is the case in qed where 1 = 1/3
and g stands for the expansion parameter  = e2. this expression obviously has a pole
singularity at

x = x  exp(1/1g) = exp(3/) .

as far as the qed eective coupling is proportional to the (transverse part of) photon
propagator, this pole, generally, describes some bound state of a system with the photon
quantum numbers. however, a pole related to a physical bound state must have positive
residue while the l.h.s. of eq.(23) has a negative one.

this means that it corresponds not to a physical but rather to some unphysical,
so-called ghost, state. the presence of a ghost singularity can be treated as a signal of
inconsistency of a theory. such claims have been made [20] in the mid 50s when the
ghost-pole trouble was rst discovered [21] just before the birth of the rgm.

the rg method proved to be very eective for a general discussion of the ghost-pole
issue. the rst question that must be answered here is the stability of indication of the
ghost-pole existence with respect to the multi-loop corrections.

note that in a perturbation calculation, the function depends on the adopted
renormalization procedure; at the massless case, starting with the 3-loop level the coef-
cients of the perturbation series (54) depend on the renormalization scheme (rs) used.
in qed, the 3-loop  function in mom (i.e., momentum subtraction) scheme is

(60)

the numerical value of the last parenthesis is about 0.4. neglecting it for the moment,
we start our discussion with the two-loop approximation for the  function. according
to eq.(24), the 2-loop iterative rg solution is

(2) =

1  


3 l + 3
4 ln(1  
22

3 l)

.

this solution has an error of an order of 4l and is interesting from several points
of view. as it has been mentioned before, its  expansion besides leading logs contains
an innite number of next-to-leading terms 2(l)m, the rst of which has been used
as an input for construction of the  function. second, in the vicinity of the ghost pole
of the one-loop rg solution at l1 = 3/, the twoloop (2) solution diers from (1)
considerably. hence, an innite sum of the next-to-leading logarithmic contributions in
the region l  1 becomes important.
it is not trivial because for an each order of the perturbation input the next-to-leading
term is negligible comparing with the leading one of the previous order (the ratio being
of an order of 2/1 = 3/4  2.103). it can be seen with the help of (56) that the
allowing for the last, 3-loop, term in (60) also becomes essential for the   1 case.
this means that the problem of existence for the ghost pole in qed cannot be
solved by taking into the account of next-to-leading and so on logs. moreover, one can
argue [22] on general rg ground that it is impossible to make any qualitative statement
about the uv asymptote for the (g) > g case basing on rg-improved perturbation
calculations. our next example illustrates this thesis.

scalar quartic model

important progress has been achieved in 80s in the higher perturbation orders calcula-
tion. the  function was calculated in the ms-scheme up to the 5-loop level [23]

m s

g2

g3 + 16.275g4  135.8g5 + 1437g6 .

we see from this expression that, in conrast with the qed case, due to its alternate-
sign structure, there is no stability here even on a qualitative level. the odd-order
approximations have a ghost-pole type behavior, whereas the even ones yield the xed
point (nite charge renormalization) case. note also that, as can be shown [24], the
upper boundary of the 10% condence region corresponds to g values close to 0.1 .

to comprehend the loop dependence of this boundary it is useful to represent

expression m s
(5)

in a slightly dierent form

m s(g) =

(cid:18) g

0.222(cid:19)3

+(cid:18) g

0.180(cid:19)4(cid:21) .

(61)

it is clear now, that a boundary of the condence region diminishes with rising the
order of a loop approximation. the expression (61) looks like a beginning of a power
asymptotic series of the poincare type. indeed, if we represent the  -function in a series
expansion form (54) then, as it is can be shown, the coecients n at n  1 behave
like  n!.

23

the method of determining asymptotic estimates of the perturbation expansion co-
ecients of the green functions uses a representation in the form of a functional (i.e.
path) integral. this integral written down for the mentioned expansion coecient can
be calculated by the steepest descent method in the function space. to the saddle point,
there corresponds an instantontype euclidean classical solution with a nite action.
in this manner, an asymptotic expression was obtained [25] for the coecients of the

 function expansion. it has the form

n 

1.096

162 n! n7/2(cid:16)1 + o(n1)(cid:17)

(n  ) .

(62)

the factorial growth of coecients indicates that this is a power asymptotic series with
zero radius of convergence that cannot be summed in the usual manner. we can obtain
the information about the singularity structure at the origin (g = 0) by using some
special procedures. one of them is the borel summation method.

here, we give short exposition of the results on the attempt of the summation of the

series of (61) type made in [24] (see also the review [26]).

authors of the ref. [24] used as an input the -function 4-loop expression in the

symmetric mom-scheme

m om

(g) =

g2 

17

g3 + 19.3g4  146g5 .

(63)

this alternate-sign asymptotic series can be summed by the borel method. the idea
is to represent the sum in a form of a laplace transform integral. it is not dicult to
see that the transition to the laplace image just kills the factorial factor n!. for the
modied borel transformation

perturbation series can be written down as

it has a nonzero circle of convergence and can be summed within the circle. however, as
the integration domain in (64) goes outside the convergency region, we must make an an-
alytic continuation for the function b(x). it can be done by a conformal transformation
of the x-plane into the w-plane to map the domain of integration [0,] into the interior
of the unit disk and the cut [,1] into the boundary of the disk. one can choose
this transformation in such a way that it correctly reproduces the singularity on the cut.
the result of conformal transformation x  w(x) = (1 + x 1) (1 + x + 1)1 looks

quite well :

b(x) =

3x2
128

(1  0.32w  0.127w2 + 0.084w3) .

24

then, by transformation reverse to (64) one can reconstruct beta function (g) which
is nonanalytic in the g variable with essential singularity at g = 0. graphs of the
function (g) obtained by the borel summation with allowance for the 1-, 2-, 3- and
4-loop approximations look very similar one to other.

they all lie now in a narrow parabolic ray slightly below the original one-loop
parabola and within the limit of 10% accuracy enable to advance into the region g  50.
this means that the summation procedure adopted enlarges the condence interval in
several hundred times! besides this it gives the qualitative stability of results. all they
are now in favour of a ghost-type uv asymptote.

nevertheless, these results can be considered only as a support but not the proof
of the 4-model inconsistency. the weak point here is that starting with (64) we have
assumed the denite analyticity properties of (g) in the whole complex g-plane.

3.3 massdependent analytic solution

a general method of an approximate solution to the massive (i.e., mass-dependent) rg
equations was developed in ref.[27]. analytic expressions of a high level of accuracy for
an eective coupling and a one-argument function were obtained up to 3 and 4loop
order [28].

for example, the two-loop massive rgsolution for the invariant coupling

s(q2)(2)

rg =

1 + sa1(q2, m2) + sa2/a1) ln (1 + sa1(...))

s

(65)

at small s values corresponds to perturbation expansion

s(q2)(2)

pert = s  2

sa1(q2, m2) + 3

sha2

1  a2(q2, m2)i + . . . .

at the same time, it smoothly interpolates between two massless limits (with a 
 ln q2 + c) at q2  m2 and q2  m2 described by an equation analogous to (47).
in the latter case it can be represented in the form usual for the qcd practice:

1
s (q2/2)(2)

rg  1(ln

q2

2 + b1 ln ln

q2

2!) ; b1 =

2
2
1

.

solution (65) demonstrates, in particular, that the threshold crossing generally chan-

ges the subtraction scheme [29].

the investigation [27, 28] was prompted by the problem of taking explicitly into
account of heavy quark masses in qcd. however, the results obtained are important
from a more general point of view for a discussion of the scheme dependence problem
in qft. the method used could also be of interest for rg applications in other elds
within the situation with disturbed homogeneity, such as, e.g., intermediate asymptotics
in hydrodynamics, nite-size scaling in critical phenomena and the excluded volume
problem in polymer theory.

25

in paper [30], this method was applied to the evolution of eective gauge couplings
in standard model (sm). here, a new analytic solution of a coupled system of three
mass-dependent two-loop rg equations for three sm gauge couplings was obtained.

for this goal, one has to start with a perturbative input for the sm couplings

i(q2, m2)  i  2

i ai(q, m, ) + 3

i a2

i (q)  2

i xj

jaij(q) ;

i = 1, 2, 3.

(66)

where ai and aij are one- and two-loop mass- and -dependent contributions of ap-
propriate feynman diagrams. in the framework of a massive renorm-group formalism
[7, 8, 10] the corresponding lie equations look like

i(q2, m2)  2

i (q)
ai(q) +xj


j(q) aij(q)


(67)

with a  a/;  = ln q2/2 . note that in the uv limit ai(q) = i ; aij(q) = ij
we arrive at the system

i() = 

i +xj

ijj()
 2

i ()

that is commonly used  see, e.g., refs.[31]  for the discussion of data extrapolation
across the gauge desert and possibility of grand unication.

the latter system can be solved iteratively in the form

1

i()

=

1
i

+ i +xj

ij
j

ln[1 + jj] ; i = i() .

(68)

here, we present a generalization of this solution for the massive case, that is conve-
nient for taking into account of threshold eects and discussing, in particular, the issue
of the grand unication consistency check.

using the method of the paper [32], one can obtain explicit iterative solution to the
system (67). here, as in the massless case, one rst solves the one-loop approximation
to (67) to get 4

(1)
i (q2, m2) = [1/i + ai(q2, m2)]1 .

inserting then this explicit expression into the second factor in the r.h.s. of (67) and
performing an approximate integration of some integral  for detail see paper [32] 
we arrive at the expression

1

i(q2, m2)

=

1
i

+ ai(q) +xj

aij(q)
aj(q)

ln[1 + jaj(q)] .

(69)

quite analogous to (65).

4this exact solution of an one-loop massive rg equation was rst obtained in ref.[33].

26

the remarkable feature of this solution is that it depends explicitly only on mass-
dependent perturbation coecients ai(q), aij(q) and, being expanded in powers of
coupling constants, exactly corresponds to the perturbative input (66). on the other
hand, in the massless limit it goes to solution (68).

the accuracy of the last approximate expression can be estimated by the method
used in paper [34]. generally, it corresponds to the accuracy 5 of threeloop expression
(  5 ln ) for the eective coupling in the one-coupling case that is quite sucient for
current pactice.

3.4 some important results

in the early 70s, s. weinberg [35] proposed the notion of a running mass of a fermion.
if considered from the viewpoint of paper [13], this idea can be formulated as follows:

any parameter of the lagrangian can be treated as a (generalized) coupling constant,

and its eective counterpart should be included into the renorm-group formalism.

new possibilities for applying the rg method were discovered when the technique of
operator expansion at short distances (on the light cone) appeared [36]. the plausibility
of this approach stems from the fact that the rg transformation, regarded as a dyson
transformation of the renormalized vertex function, involves the simultaneous scaling
of all its invariant arguments  normally, the squares of the momenta. meanwhile, for
the physical amplitude, some of them are xed on a mass shell. the expansion on the
light cone, so to say, separates the arguments, as a result of which it becomes possible
to study the physical uv asymptotic behaviour by means of the expansion coecients
(when some momenta being xed on mass shell). as an important example, we can
mention the evolution equations for moments of qcd structure functions [37].

the revealing of an asymptotic freedom phenomenon can be considered as the most

important result obtained in particle physics by the rg technique.

historically, this discovery was made [38] in the framework of the su(3) nonabelian
yang-mills model in the early 70s. since that time this model for the eightcomponent
4-vector eld bab
 (x) was adopted as a basic ingredient for the qft description of matter
on the parton level.

the key point is that self-interaction of this non-abelian gluonic quantum eld due to
dominance of its unphysical components gives negative contribution to the beta function
perturbation expansion. for the two-loop (schemeindependent) case

qcd() = 12  23

with positive 1,2 for a number nf of quark avours small enough.

correspondingly, the one-loop renorm-group expression

(1)

s (x; s) =

s

1 + s1 ln x

,

5see eqs.(13) and (16) in ref.[34].

27

for the qcd eective coupling exhibits a remarkable uv asymptotic behaviour thanks
to 1 being positive. this expression implies, in contrast to eq.(23), that the eective
qcd coupling decreases as x  q2 increases and tends to zero in the uv limit. this
feature discovered in the early 70s, precisely corresponded to the parton physical picture
of the hadronic structure.

one more interesting application of the rg method in the multicoupling case, as-
cending to 50s [12], refers to special solutions, the so-called separatrixes in a phase space
of several invariant couplings. these solutions relate eective couplings and represent
scale-invariant trajectories, like, e.g., gi = gi(g1) in the phase space which are straight
lines in the one-loop case.

some of them that are attractive (or stable) in the uv limit, are related to sym-
metries that reveal themselves in the high-energy domain. it was conjectured that these
trajectories may be related to hidden symmetries of a lagrangian and even could serve
as a tool to nd them. on this basis the method was developed [39] for nding out these
symmetries. it was shown that in the phase space of invariant couplings the internal
symmetry corresponds to a singular solution that remains a straight-line when higher or-
der corrections are taken into account. such solutions corresponding to supersymmetry
were derived for some combinations of gauge, yukawa and quartic interactions.

generally, these singular solutions obey the relations

dgi
dl

=

dgi
dg1

dg1
dl

,

l = ln x

which are known since zimmermanns paper [40] as the reduction equations. in the 80s
they were used [41] (see also review paper [42] and references therein) in the uv analyzis
of asymptotically free models. just for these cases the one-loop reduction relations are
adequate to physics.

quite recently some other application of this technique was obtained in supersym-
metric generalizations of grand unication scenario in the standard model.
it was
shown [43, 44] that it is possible to achieve complete uv niteness of a theory if yukawa
couplings are related to the gauge ones in a way corresponding to these special solutions,
that is, to reduction relations.

the mass-dependent technique described in section 3.3 was successfully used for
the development of the dhar-gupta approach [45, 46] that led to nite perturbative
predictions for a physical quantity which is free of renormalization scheme ambiguities.
in paper [47], this approach was reformulated for the mass-dependent case with several
coupling constants.

one more recent qft development relevant to the renorm-group is the analytic
approach to perturbative qcd (pqcd). it is based upon the procedure of invariant
analyticization [48, 49] ascending to the end of 50s.

the approach consists in the combining of two ideas: the rg summation of uv logs
with analyticity in the q2 variable, imposed by spectral representation of the kallen
lehmann type which implements general properties of the local qft including the

28

bogoliubov condition of microscopic causality. this combination was rst devised [50]
to get rid of the ghost pole in qed about forty years ago.

here, the pqcd invariant coupling s(q2) is transformed into an analytic cou-
pling an(q2/2)  a(x) which, by construction, is free of ghost singularities due to
incorporating some nonperturbative structures.
this analytic coupling a(x) has no unphysical singularities in the complex q2-plane;
its conventional perturbative expansion precisely coincides with the usual perturbation
one for s(q2) ; it has no extra parameters; it obeys a universal ir limiting value a(0) =
4/0 independent of the scale parameter ; it turns out to be remarkably stable [49]
in the ir domain with respect to higher-loop corrections and, in turn, to the scheme
dependence.

meanwhile, the analyticized perturbation expansion [51] for an observable f , in
contrast to the usual case, may contain specic functions an(x), instead of powers
(a(x))n . in other words, the pertubation series for f (x), due to analyticity imperative,
can change its form in the ir region [19] turning into an asymptotic expansion `a la
erdelyi over a nonpower set {an(x)} .

4 rg expansion

in 70s and 80s rgm was applied to (besides qft) critical phenomena: polymers, tur-
bulence, non-coherent radiation transfer, dynamical chaos, and so on. simpler and less
sohpisticated motivation in critical phenomena (than in qft) makes this explosion
of rg applications possible.

4.1 critical phenomena

4.1.1

spin lattices

the so called renormalization group in critical phenomena is based on the kadano
wilson procedure [52, 53] referred to as decimation or blocking. initially, it emerged
from the problem of spin lattice. imagine a regular (two- or three- dimentional) lattice
consisting of n d, d = 2, 3 cites with an elementary step a between them. suppose, that
at every site a spin vector  is sitting. the hamiltonian describing the spin interaction
of nearest neighbours

h = kxi

i  i1

(70)

contains k, the coupling constant. the statistical sum is obtained from the partition
function, s =< exp(h/) >aver. .
to realize the blocking or decimation, one has to perform the spin averaging over
block consisting of nd elementary sites. this is a very essential step as far as it dimin-
ishes the degree of freedom number (from n d to (n/n)d). it destroys the small-range
properties of the system under consideration, in the averaging course some information

29

being lost. however, the long-range physics (like correlation length essential for phase
transition) is not aected by it, and we gain simplication of our problem.

after this procedure, new eective spins  arise in sites of a new eective lattice
with a step na. we obtain also a new eective hamiltonian, with new eective coupling
kn that has to be dened in the averaging process as a function of k and n

he = knxi

i  i1 + h ,

where h contains quartic and higher terms; h = p       +    .

for the ir (long-distance) properties, h is unessential. hence, we can conclude

that the spin averaging leads to an approximate transformation,

kxi

    knxi

   ,

(71)

or, taking into account the elementary step change, to

kwn : {a  n a, k  kn} .

the latter is the kadano-wilson transformation.

in general, the new coupling constant kn is a function of the old one and of
the decimation index n. it is convenient to write it down in the form kn = k(1/n, k).
then, the kw transformation can be formulated as follows:

kw (n) : (cid:26)a  na,

k  kn = k(cid:18) 1

n

, k(cid:19)(cid:27) .

these transformations obey the group composition law

kw (n)  kw (m) = kw (nm)

if

k(x, k) = k(

this is just the rg symmetry.

x
t

, k(t, k))

(cid:20)x =

1
nm

, t =

1

n(cid:21) .

(72)

(73)

we observe the following points:
 the rg symmetry is approximate (due to neglecting by h).
 the transformations kw (n) are discrete.
 there exist no reverse transformation to kw (n) .

hence, the kadano-wilson renormalization group is an approximate and discrete
semi-group. for a long distance (ir limit) physics, however, h is irrelevant, (1/n)
is close to continuum and it is possible to use dierential lie equations.

in application of these transformations to critical phenomena the notion of a xed
point is important. as it was explained in section 3.1, it is usually associated with
power-type asymptotic behavior. note here that, contrary to the qft case considered
in section 3.1, in phase transition physics we deal with the ir stable point.

30

4.1.2 polymer theory

in the polymer physics one considers statistical properties of polymer macromolecules
which can be imagined as a very long chain of identical elements. the number of elements
n could be as big as 105, the macromolecular size reaching several hundred angstroms.
such a big molecular chain forms a specic pattern resembling the pattern of a
random walk. the central problem of the polymer theory is very close to that of a
random walk and can be formulated as follows.

for a very long chain of n steps (the size of each step = a) one has to nd
the chain size rn as the distance between the start and the nish points, the
distribution function of angles i between neighboring elements being given.

the function f () is dened by the forces between adjacent elements depending on
some external factors like temperature t . the essential feature of a polymer chain is
the impossibility of a self-intersection. this is known as an excluded volume eect in
the random walk problem. in reality, polymer molecules are swimming in a solvent and
form globulars.

for large n values the molecular size rn follows the power fleury law rn  n 
with , the fleury index. when n is given, rn is a functional of f () which depends on
external conditions (e.g., temperature t , properties of solvent, etc. ). if t increases, rn
increases and at some moment globulars touch one another. this is the polymerization
process very similar to a phase transition phenomenon.

the kadanovwilson rg (kwrg) blocking ideology has been used in polymer
physics by de gennes [54]. the key idea is a grouping of n chain subsequent elements
into a new elementary block. this grouping operation is very close to kadanos
blocking. it leads to the transformation

{1  n ; a  an}

which is analogous to one for spin lattice decimation. this transformation must be
specied by a direct calculation which gives the explicit form of an = a(n, a). here we
have a discrete semi-group. then, by using the kwrg technique, one nds the xed
point, obtains the fleury power law and can calculate its index .

generally, the excluded volume eect yields some complications. however, inside the
qft rg framework it can be treated rather simply [55] by introducing an additional
argument similar to nite length l in transfer problem and particle mass m in qtf.

besides polymers, the kwrg approach has been used in some elds of physics, like
percolation, noncoherent radiation transfer [56], dynamical chaos [57] and some others.
meanwhile, the original qftrg approach proliferated into the theory of turbulence.

4.1.3 turbulence

to formulate the turbulence problem on the rg language one has to perform the
following steps [59, 60, 61]:

1. introduce the generating functional for correlation functions.

31

2. write the path integral representation for this functional.

3. by changing the function integration variable nd the equivalence of the classical

statistical system to some quantum eld theory model.

4. construct the system of schwingerdyson equations for this equivalent qft.

5. perform the nite renormalization procedure.

6. derive the rg equations.

4.2 paths of rg expansion

rg is expanded in diverse elds of physics in two dierent ways:

 by direct analogy with the kadanov-wilson construction (averaging over some set
of degrees of freedom) in polymers, non-coherent transfer and percolation, i.e.,
constructing a set of models for a given physical problem.

 search for an exact rg symmetry by proof of the equivalence with a qft model:

e.g., in turbulence (refs. [59, 61]), plasma turbulence [62] and some others.

to the question are there dierent renormalization groups? the answer is positive:

1. in qft and some simple macroscopic examples (like, onedimentional transfer
problem) , rg symmetry is an exact symmetry of the solution formulated in its
natural variables.

2. in turbulence, continuous spin-eld models and some others, it is a symmetry of

an equivalent qft model.

3. in polymers, percolation, etc. , (with kw blocking), the rg transformation is
a transformation between dierent auxiliary models (specially constructed for this
purpose) of a given system.

as we have shown, there is no essential dierence in the mathematical formalism.

there exists, however, a profound dierence in physics:

 in cases 1 and 2 (as well as in some macroscopic examples), the rg is an exact

symmetry of a solution.

 in the kadanovwilsontype problem (spin lattice, polymers, etc. ), one has to

construct a set m of models mi. the kwrg transformation

r(n)mi = mni , with integer n

(74)

is acting inside a set of models.

4.3 two faces of rg in qft

as it was explained in section 1.4, the vacuum, i.e., the interparticle space, contain
vacuum uctuations. due to them, the charge of a particle is screened. in accordance
with dirac eq.(26), in momentum space the q2 dependence of an electron charge can be
presented

e(q2) = e(cid:26)1 +


6

ln(q2r2

e) + . . .(cid:27) ; e2 = e2(1/r2

e) = 1/137.

(75)

in terms of the classical electron charge and of electron compton lenght.

the rst idea of an additional symmetry in this problem was born by stueckelberg
and peterman [5]. in their pioneering investigation the very existence of group transfor-
mation was discovered within the renormalization procedure the result of which contains
nite arbitrariness. just this degree of freedom in nite renormalized expressions was
used by bogoliubov and shirkov in refs.[7][10]. roughly speaking, this corresponds
to the change re  1/.
the basic idea was that, instead of 1/re, one can use some other reference point .
this is equivalent to introducing of a new degree of freedom associated with the reference
point scale. instead of (75) we have

e(q2/2) = e(1 +


6

ln

q2

2 + . . .) .

(76)

here, the eective charge is considered after the subtracting of innities and is given
by a nite representation (76). the rg symmetry is formulated in terms of the q2
scale and  represents the reference point.

another approach was used by gell-mann and low [6]. their paper was devoted to
the short distance behaviour in a nonlocal qed with a cuto , and the  degree of
freedom was used to analyze the uv behaviour. instead of renormalization, there is a
regularization and the charge is given by the singular representation

e() = e(cid:18)1 +


6

ln 2r2

e +    (cid:19)

(77)

which is singular in the limit   .
we can draw a transparent picture (as was commented later by wilson in his nobel
lecture) of the last approach. imagine an electron of a nite size, smeared over a small
volume with the radius ri = h/ci , ln(2/m2
e)  1. the electric charge ei of such a
non-local electron is considered as depending on the cut-o momentum i so that this
dependence accumulates the vacuum polarization eects which, in reality, take place at
distances from the point electron smaller than ri. we deal with a set of models of the
non-local electron correponding to dierent values of the cut-o i. here, ei depends on
ri and the vacuum polarization eects in the excluded volume r3
i should be subtracted.
in this language, the rg transformation is the transition from one value of the smearing
radius to another ri  rj, simultaneously with a corresponding change of the eective

33

in other words, the rg symmetry here is that related to
electron charge ei  ej.
operations in the space of models of non-local qed constructed in such a way that at
large distances every model is equivalent to the real local one.

5 rg symmetry in mathematical physics

5.1 functional self-similarity

the rg transformations discussed above have close connection with the concept of a
self-similarity(ss). the ss transformations for problems formulated by nonlinear partial
des are well known, since the last century, mainly in dynamics of liquids and gases.
they are one parameter  transformations dened as simultaneous power scaling of
independent variables z = {x, t, . . .} , solutions fk(z) and other functions vi(z)
{x  x , t  ta , fk(z)  fk(z) = kfk(z) , vi(z) = ivi(z) }

s :

entering into the equations.

to emphasize their power structure, we use a term power self-similarity = pss.

according to zeldovich and barenblatt, [63, 64] the pss can be classied as:

a/ pss of the 1st kind

with all indices a, ..., , ... being (half)integers (integer pss) that are usually found
from the theory of dimensions;

b/ pss of the 2nd kind

with irrational indices (fractal pss) which should be dened from dynamics.

to relate rg with pss, let us turn to the solution of the renorm-group fe

g(xt, g) = g(x, g(t, g)) .

its general solution is known; it depends on an arbitrary function of one argument 
see eq.(38). however, at the moment we are interested in a special solution linear in
the second argument: g(x, g) = gf (x). the function f (x) should satisfy the equation
f (xt) = f (x)f (t) with the solution f (x) = x . hence, g(x, t) = gx. this means that in
our special case, linear in g, the rg transformation (6) is reduced to pss transformation,

rt  {x  xt1, g  gt} = st

.

(78)

generally, in rg, instead of a power law, we have arbitrary functional dependence.
thus, one can consider transformations (6), (15) and (17) as functional generalizations
of usual (i.e., power) self-similarity transformations. hence, it is natural to refer to them
as to the transformations of functional scaling or functional (self)similarity (fs) rather
than to rg-transformations. in short,

with fs standing for functional similarity.

rg  fs ,

34

we can now answer the question concerning the physical meaning of the symmetry
underlying fs and the bogoliubovs renormgroup. as we have mentioned, it is not
a symmetry of the physical system or the equations of the problem at hand, but a
symmetry of a solution considered as a function of the relevant physical variables and
suitable boundary conditions. a symmetry like that can be related, in particular, to
the invariance of a physical quantity described by this solution with respect to the way
in which the boundary conditions are imposed. the changing of this way constitutes a
group operation in the sense that the group composition law is related to the transitivity
property of such changes.

homogeneity is an important feature of the physical systems under consideration.
however, homogeneity can be violated in a discrete manner. imagine that such a discrete
inhomogeneity is connected with a certain value of x , say, x = y. in this case the rg
transformation with the canonical parameter t will have the form (14) with the group
composition law (15).

the symmetry connected with fs is a very simple and frequently encountered prop-
erty of physical phenomena.
it can easily be discovered in numerous problems of
theoretical physics like classical mechanics, transfer theory, classical hydrodynamics,
and so on [65, 17, 16].

5.2 recent application to boundary value problem

recently, some interesting attempts have been made to use the rg concept in classical
mathematical physics, in particular, to study strong nonlinear regimes and to investigate
asymptotic behavior of physical systems described by nonlinear pdes.

about a decade ago, the rg ideas were applied by late veniamin pustovalov with
co-authors [67] to analyze a problem of generating higher harmonics in plasma. this
problem, after some simplication, was reduced to a couple of partial des with the
boundary parameter  solution characteristic  explicitly included.
it was proved
that corresponding solutions admitted an exact symmetry group that takes into account
transformations of this boundary parameter, which is related to the amplitude of the
magnetic eld at a critical density point. the solution symmetry obtained was then
used to evaluate the eciency of harmonics generation in cold and hot plasma. the
advantageous use of the rg-approach in solving the above particular problem gave
promise that it may work in other cases and this was illustrated in [68] by a series of
examples for various boundary value problems.

moreover, in refs. [65, 68] the possibility of devising a regular method for nding a
special class of symmetries of solution to the boundary value problem (bvp) in math-
ematical physics, namely, rg-type symmetries, was discussed. the latter are dened
as solution symmetries with respect to transformations involving parameters that enter
through the equations as well as through the boundary conditions in addition to (or
even rather than) the natural variables of the equations.

as it is well known, the aim of the modern group analysis [69, 70], which goes back
to works by s. lie [71], is to nd symmetries of des. this approach does not include a

35

similar problem of studying the symmetries of solutions of these equations. outside the
main direction of both the classical and modern analysis, there remains as well a study
of solution symmetries with respect to transformations involving not only the variables
present in the equations, but also parameters entering into the solutions from boundary
conditions.

from the afore-said it is clear that the symmetries which attracted attention in
the 50s in connection with the discovery of the rg in qft were those involving the
parameters of the system in the group transformations. it is natural to refer to these
symmetries related to fs (or rg-type) symmetries.

it should be noted that the procedure of revealing the fs symmetry (fss), or some
group feature, similar to the fs regularity, in any partial case (qft, spin lattice, poly-
mers, turbulence and so on) up to now is not a regular one. in practice, it needs some
imagination and atypical manipulation invented for every particular case  see the
discussion in [72]. by this reason, the possibility to nd a regular approach to construct-
ing fss is of principal interest.

recently, a possible scheme of this kind was presented as applied to a mathematical
model that is described by a bvp. the leading idea [65, 68, 73] in this case is based on
the fact that solution symmetry for this system can be found in a regular manner by
using the well-developed methods of modern group analysis.

the scheme that describes devising of fss and its application is then formulated
[74, 76] as follows. firstly, a specic rg-manifold should be constructed. secondly, some
auxiliary symmetry, i.e., the most general symmetry group admitted by this manifold is
to be found. thirdly, this symmetry should be restricted on a particular solution to get
the fss. fourthly, the fss allows one to improve an approximate solution or, in some
cases, to get an exact solution.

depending on both a mathematical model and boundary conditions, the rst step of
this procedure can be realized in dierent ways. in some cases, the desired fs-manifold
is obtained by including parameters, entering into a solution via an equation(s) and a
boundary condition, in the list of independent variables. the extension of the space of
variables involved in group transformations, e.g., by taking into account the dependence
of coordinates of the renormgroup operator upon dierential and/or non-local variables
(which leads to the liebacklund and non-local transformation groups [70]) can also
be used for constructing the fsmanifold. the use of the ambartsumian invariant
embedding method [77] and of dierential constraints sometimes allows reformulations
of a boundary condition in a form of additional de(s) and enables one to construct
the fs-manifold as a combination of original and embedding equations (or dierential
constraints) which are compatible with these equations. at last, of particular interest is
the perturbation method of constructing the fsmanifold which is based on the presence
of a small parameter.

the second step, the calculating of a most general group g admitted by the fs
manifold, is a standard procedure in the group analysis and has been described in detail
in many texts and monographs  see, for example, [69, 78].

36

the symmetry group g thus constructed cannot as yet be referred to as a renorm
group. in order to obtain this, the next, third step should be done which consists in
restricting g on a solution of a boundary value problem. this procedure utilizes the in-
variance condition and mathematically appears as a combining of dierent coordinates
of group generators admitted by the fsmanifold.

the nal step, i.e., constructing analytic expression for the solution of the boundary

value problem on the basis of the fs, usually presents no specic problems.

a review of the results, which were obtained on the basis of the formulated scheme,

can be found, for example, in [76, 79, 80].

we mention briey, the fs analysis result for a particular problem of nonlinear
optics, the problem of the laser beam self-focusing in a nonlinear medium. here, one
have a bvp for a coupled system of two nonlinear pdes with the boundary condition
given in a form of two one-argument functions. with help of rg=fs approach one new
exact analytic and one new approximate analytic solution (for the practically important
gaussian initial transverse prole) has been found [81].

the important qualitative features of this example are:

 the two-dimension structure has been analysed, that has a singularity in the be-

havior of derivatives with respect to transverse coordinate,

 the algebraic structure of the fss operators is dierent from that of usual rg of
the qft type. here, we meet with a set of several innitesimal renormgroup oper-
ators, each of those can be used to reconstruct the analytic (exact or approximate)
solution of bvp starting from the perturbative theory result. moreover, renorm-
group operators for exact solutions of bvp obtained appear as lie-backlund (not
lie) innitesimal operators.

up to now the outlined regular method is feasible for systems that can be described
by des and is based on the formalism of modern group analysis. however, it seems also
possible to extend this approach to boundary value problems that are not described just
by dierential equations. a chance of such an extension is based on recent advances
in group analysis of systems of integro-dierential equations [82] which allow transfor-
mations of both dynamical variables and functionals of a solution to be formulated
[83]. more intriguing is the issue of a possibility of constructing a regular approach for
more complicated systems, in particular to those having an innite number of degrees
of freedom. the formers can be represented in a compact form by functional (or path)
integrals.

[77] the embedding method was introduced by v.a.ambartzumyan in astr. journ. 19
(1942) 30  in russian; later on this method enjoyed wide application to dierent
problems  see, e.g., j.casti, r.kalaba, imbedding methods in applied mathematics
