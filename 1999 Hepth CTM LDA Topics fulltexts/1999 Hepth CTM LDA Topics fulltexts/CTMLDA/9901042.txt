space c (or c/zz2) induces periodicity isomorphisms: k(rp,q) = k(rp,q+2), k(rp,q) = k(rp+2,q) (5.2) therefore, k(r9p,pd) depends parity p d. consider rst case p even. application hopkins formula (5.1)

(5.4) used suspension isomorphism substitute zz2-graded index n. let us analyze term part sequence (5.4). rst term obviously isomorphic k-theory k(r9p,pn) compact support interested in. since b9p+1,0 equivariantly contractable, also get k n zz2 (pt), second term (5.4). therefore, sequence (5.4) relates groups question cohomology theory horizon h = rp9p : zz2 (b9p+1,0) = k n k n(rp9p) = (cid:26) zz zz2r , 0, r = (cid:2) 9p n odd. 2 (cid:3), n even; careful analysis ring structure shows (5.4) maps generator kzz2 (b9p+1,0) generator k n(rp9p). finally, follows kzz2 (r9p+1,0) = zz k 1 zz2 (b9p+1,0) = 0. convenient list results following table: k(r9p,pd) even odd p even p odd 0 zz r 0 since odd values p possible type iib sring theory, d-brane charges localized rp+1 (r9p/(1)fl i9p) orientifolds classied second line table. states orientifolds already discussed literature. example, p = 9, obtain standard spectrum type iia string theory: even- dimensional branes arbitrary integer charge. notice, obtain direct argument 18 d-brane charges type iia string theory classied k(x), regarding (1)fl orientifold type iib theory. recently, non-bps d-particle o5-plane also discussed sen {$9805019$}. note, charge d-particle orientifold r6 (r4/ i4) takes value zz2, charge d-particle lives r6 (r4/(1)fl i4) orientifold arbitrary integer. actually discrepancy here, k-theory classies charges topologically stable objects weak coupling. contrary, s-duality relates two types orientifolds inverts string coupling constant, i.e. maps type (i) orientifold weak coupling type (ii) orientifold strong coupling. hence, spectra states may same. also show masses states dier factor 2. 5.1. stringy construction using analogy type iia string theory, dicult provide string theory construction new states. case p = 5 done bergman gaberdiel {$9802067$}. following notation {$9802067$}, dene type iib closed string boundary state light-cone gauge: |bd, = exp{xn>0 1 n  + ixr>0 }|bd, i(0) = n zz. index r labels fermion oscillators runs integers half-integers (r zz + 1 2 ) depending sector: untwisted twisted (u/t); ns r; neumann (i = 1, . . . , + 1) dirichlet (i = + 2, . . . , 8) boundary conditions. usual, choose ns ns sector ground state |bd, i(0) odd (1)fl (1)fr. therefore, ns ns boundary state new d-branes must form ordinary type ii d-branes. hand, even, r r boundary states invariant (1)fl untwisted sector type iib string. nevertheless, closed string spectrum includes twisted sector left-gso projection opposite, get invariant r r boundary states d-even. means even-dimensional branes found interpreted twisted states localized orientifold plane. combining contributions ns ns r r sectors, obtain: |bdi = (|u d, +insns |u d, insns) + (|t d, +irr + |t d, irr) 19 boundary state precisely form boundary state ordinary type iia d-brane. hence, masses corresponding d-branes also equal (there extra factor 2). authors {$9802067$} also noticed masses d-particles orientifolds type (i) type (ii) dierent. observe masses states match, also charges dierent. again, conrms idea simply follow weak strong coupling. 6. miscellany 6.1. orientifolds type (iii) relation cliord algebras previous sections considered type iib orientifolds divided either (1)fl perturbative symmetry group. amalgamating two cases obtain orientifolds type (iii): rp+1 (r9p/(1)fl i9p) (6.1) even though try develop kr-theory orientifolds, comments place here. order calculate groups kr(x), need analog hopkins formula (5.1) real category, something like: kr(x) = krzz2 (x r1,1) (6.2) validity formula would strongly depend denition appropriate k- theory. example, (6.2) would true dened kr(x) cohomology theory x ts following exact sequence (the way similar m. j. hopkins dened k(x) group): . . . krzz2 (x) kr(x) kr(x) . . .
