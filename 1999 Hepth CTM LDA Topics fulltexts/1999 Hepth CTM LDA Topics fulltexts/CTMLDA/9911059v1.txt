gamow vectors are generalized eigenvectors (kets) of self-adjoint hamiltonians with complex
eigenvalues (eri/2) describing quasistable states. in the relativistic domain this leads to poincare
semigroup representations which are characterized by spin j and by complex invariant mass square
s = sr = (cid:0)mr  i
. relativistic gamow kets have all the properties required to describe

relativistic resonances and quasistable particles with resonance mass mr and lifetime /r.

i. introduction

following wigner [1], an elementary relativistic quantum system, an elementary particle with mass m and spin s
is in the mathematical theory described by the space of a unitary irreducible representation (uir) of the poincare
group p. from these uir, the relativistic quantum elds are constructed [2]. more complicated relativistic systems are
described by direct sums of uir (for towers of elementary particles) or by direct products of uir (for combination
of two or more elementary particles). a direct product of uir may be decomposed into a continuous direct sum
(integral) of irreducible representations [3,4]. the uir are characterized by three invariants (m2, j, sign(p0)), where j
represents the spin and the real number m represents the mass of elementary particle (we restrict ourselves here to
sign(p0) = +1).

the uir of the poincare group p describe stable elementary particles (stationary systems). the vast majority of
elementary particles are unstable and uir provide only a more or less approximate description of them. the meaning
of unstable elementary particles, in particular in the relativistic domain, has always been a subject of debate. this has
recently ared-up in connection with the line shape analysis of the z-boson, where one has diculties to agree upon
a denition of resonance mass m and width . going back to wigners denition of fundamental relativistic particles
we want to present here a special class of (non-unitary) semi-group representations of p which describe quasistable
relativistic particles.
phenomenologically, one always takes the point of view that resonances are autonomous quantum physical entities,
and decaying particles are no less fundamental than stable particles. stable particles are not qualitatively dierent
from quasistable particles, but only quantitatively by a zero (or very small) value of . therefore both stable and
quasistable states should be described on the same footing. this has been accomplished in the non-relativistic case,
where a decaying state is described by a generalized eigenvector of the (self adjoint, semi-bounded) hamiltonian with
a complex eigenvalue zr = er  i/2 [5] and exponential time evolution, called gamow vectors. the stable state
vectors with real eigenvalues es are the special case with  = 0.

ii. gamow vectors

in the standard hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics, such gamow vectors can not exist and one has
to employ a formulation based on the rigged hilbert space (rhs) [6]. diracs bras and kets are, mathematically,
generalized eigenvectors with real eigenvalues, and gamow vectors are generalizations of dirac kets. they are described

by kets g  |zri2 with complex eigenvalue zr = er  i/2, where er and  are respectively interpreted as

resonance energy and width. like dirac kets, the gamow kets are functionals of a rigged hilbert space :

+  h  + : g  +,

and the mathematical meaning of the eigenvalue equation h|zri = (er  i/2)|zri is:

hh|zri  h|h|zri = zrh|zri

for all   +.

the conjugate operator h of the hamiltonian h is uniquely dened by the rst equality in (2), as the extension of
the hilbert space adjoint operator h to the space of functionals +
1; on the space h, the operators h and h
are the same.

the non-relativistic gamow vectors have the following properties:

1. they have an asymmetric (i.e., t  0 only) time evolution and obey then an exponential law:
|er  i/2i = eiertet/2|er  i/2i, only for t  0.
, and another semigroup eiht

g(t) = eiht

+

there is another gamow vector g = |er + i/2+i  

rhs   h  

 (with the same h) with the asymmetric evolution
g(t) = eiht





|er + i/2+i = eiertet/2|er + i/2+i, only for t  0.

for t  0 in another

(4)

2. the g ( g) is derived as a functional at the resonance pole term located at zr = (er  i/2) (at zr =

(er + i/2)) in the second sheet of the analytically continued s-matrix.

3. the gamow vectors have a breit-wigner energy distribution

e  (er  i/2)

, ii < e < ,

(5)

where ii means that it extends to  on the second sheet of the s-matrix (whereas the standard breit-
wigner extends to the threshold e = 0).

we want to present here a generalization of these non-relativistic gamow vectors to the relativistic case.

in the non-relativistic case the inclusion of the degeneracy quantum numbers of energy, i.e., the extension of the

dirac-lippmann-schwinger kets

to the basis of the whole galilei group is trivial.

for the two particle scattering states (direct product of two irreducible representations of the galilei group [7]) one
uses eigenvectors of angular momentum (jj3) for the relative motion and total momentum p for the center of mass
motion. thus

|etot

pjj3(l, s) i = |pi  |ejj3 i

(7)

where etot = p2

2m + e (the hamiltonian in (6) is h = h tot  p 2
2m ).

the center-of-mass motion is usually separated by transforming to the center-of-mass frame and then ignoring the

center-of-mass motion

for the vector in (6) one then uses the generalized eigenvectors of h and of angular momentum

|p = 0i  |ejj3 i  |e, jj3 i .

with

|ei = |ejj3 i  

  h  

h|ejj3 i = e|ejj3 i,

0  e <  .

(8)

(9)

1for (essentially) self adjoint h, h  is equal to (the closure of) h; but we shall use the denition (2) also for unitary operators
u where u  is the extension of u , but not of u.

the vectors (8) are the dirac-lippmann-schwinger scattering states and e runs along the cut on the positive real
axis of the 1-st sheet of the j-th partial s-matrix. the proper eigenvectors of h with e = |en| at the poles on the
negative real axis of the 1-st sheet are the bound states |enjj3i. by the galilei transformation one can transform
these vectors (8) to arbitrary momentum p; e and p are not intermingled by galilei transformations.
to obtain the non-relativistic gamow kets one analytically continues the dirac-lippmann-schwinger ket (8) into
the second sheet of the j-th partial s-matrix to the position of the resonance pole |zr = er  i/2, j, j3 i and
obtains the following representation [5]:

|zr = er  i/2, j, j3 i =

de|e, j, j3 i
a galilei transformation can boost this gamow ket to any real momentum p
|p, zr, jj3 i = u(p)|0i  |zrjj3 i.

complex momenta cannot be obtained in this way since the galilei transformations commute with the intrinsic energy
operator h.

iii. poincar e group representations with four velocity basis

in the relativistic case the lorentz transformation  in particular lorentz boosts  intermingle energy etot = p0
and momenta pi, i = 1, 2, 3. thus if energy and/or mass were complex, this would also lead to complex momentum.
to restrict the unwieldy set of poincare group representations with complex momenta we will consider a special class
of minimally complex irreducible representations of p to describe relativistic resonances and decaying elementary
particles. our construction will also lead to complex momenta p, but in our case the momenta will be minimally
complex in such a way that the 4-velocities p  p
m remain real. this construction was motivated by a remark of
d. zwanziger [8] and is based on the fact that the 4-velocity eigenvectors |pj3(mj)i furnish as valid a basis for the
representation space of p as the usual wigner basis of momentum eigenvectors |pj3(m, j)i. this means every state
    h(m, j)   of an uir (m2, j), (where  denotes the space of well-behaved vectors and  the space of
kets for the hilbert space h(m, j) of an uir), can be written according to diracs basis vector decomposition as

 =xj3 z d3 p

2p0|p, j3ihj3, p|i

where we have chosen the invariant measure

as a consequence of (12), the -function normalization of these velocity-basis vectors is

)  .

h, p| p, i = 2p03(p  p)  = 2p0m23(p  p

(13)
here, |p, j3i   are the eigenkets of the 4-velocity operator p = pm1 and |j3 (p)|2 = |hj3 p|i|2 represents
the 4-velocity distribution of the vector . the 4-velocity eigenvectors are often more useful for physical reasoning,
because 4-velocities seem to fulll to rather good approximation velocity super-selection rules which the momenta
do not [9]. their use as basis vectors of the poincare group representation (11) does not constitute an approximation.
the relativistic gamow vectors will be dened, not as momentum eigenvectors, but as 4-velocity eigenvectors in
the direct product space of uir spaces for the decay products of the resonance r. we want to obtain the relativistic
gamow vectors from the pole term of the relativistic s-matrix in complete analogy to the way the non-relativistic
gamow vectors were obtained [5]. in the absence of a vector space description of a resonance, we shall also in the
relativistic theory dene the unstable particle by the pole of the analytically continued partial s-matrix with angular
momentum j at the value s = sr  (mr  ir/2)2 of the invariant mass square variable (mandelstam variable)
2
s = (p1 + p2 +)2 = e2
r, where p1, p2,. . . are the momenta of the decay products of r [10,11]. this means that
the mass mr and lifetime /r of the complex invariant mass wr = (mr  ir/2) = sr, in addition to spin j, are
the intrinsic properties that dene a quasistable relativistic particle 2.

to obtain the clebsch-gordan coecients hp1p2[m1, m2]|pj3(wj)i in (14), one follows the same procedure as given
in the classic papers [3,4,12,13] for the clebsch-gordan coecients for the wigner (momentum) basis. this has been
done in [14]. the result is

(rotation-free lorentz transformation) u(l(p)) whose parameters are the 4-velocities p. the generators of the lorentz
transformations are the interaction-incorporating observables

p0 = h, p m, j ,

(26)

i.e., the exact generators of the poincare group ( [2] sec. 3.3). these vectors |pj3(sj)i in (23), or |0j3(wj)i in (24)
when boosted by u(l(p)) or precisely u(l(p)), span the unitary representation space of the poincare group (15) with
the exact generators (26). we will be use these dirac-lippmann-schwinger kets to dene the relativistic gamow
kets by analytic continuation.

iv. relativistic gamow kets

the relativistic gamow kets are dened from the dirac-lippmann-schwinger kets (24) or (23) by contour integrals

around the poles of the j-th partial s-matrix element. starting with the s-matrix element

(out, sin) = (, +) =xjj3 z 

(m1+m2)2

dsz d(p)h|pj3 sjisj(s)h+ pj3 sj|+i

(27)

one deforms the contour of integration over s from the physical values (m1 + m2)2  s <  on the upper rim of the
cut along the s-axis, into the second sheet past the pole at sr. for the integration around the pole sr the integral (27)
splits of a pole term which denes the gamow vector |pj3 srji. this is done in exactly the same way as in the
non-relativistic case [5] and leads to the relativistic analogue of (10) :

for all   + .

(28)

for this analytic continuation to be possible the rhs formulation of quantum theory makes a new hypothesis :
the set of prepared in-states {+} and the set of detected out-states (decay products) {} form two dierent dense
subspaces of the hilbert space h, cf. (15) and therewith two distinct rhss
 for prepared in-states +

  h  

(29a)

+  h  + for detected out-states (observables)  .

(29b)

where  (+) is of the hardy class type in the lower (upper) half plane. this means h pj3 sj|i (h+ pj3 sj|+i)
are well behaved hardy class functions of the variable s in the upper (lower) half plane second sheet. this new
hypothesis, which distinguishes meticulously between states (accelerator) and observables (detector) was justied in
the non-relativistic case by some causality arguments [16]. all our new results can be derived from this new hardy
class hypothesis which is dierent from the conventional assumptions of scattering theory {+} = {}(= h).
the rst equality in (28) is the denition that associates g to the pole term in the second sheet, and the second
equality is a consequence of the hardy class property [17]. as a consequence the wave function hpj3 sj|gi of the
gamow ket is a breit-wigner function of s that extends over all physical values of s and the non-physical values of s
on the second sheet to .
the lorentz transformations  are represented by unitary operators u() in h. this means its conjugate operator
(cid:0)u()(cid:1) (usually denoted as u()) acts in the space + in the standard way :

hu()|pj3, srji = h|(cid:0)u()(cid:1) |pj3, srji =pj

for all   +  h , all   so(3, 1) ,

3h|pj3, srjidj

3j3

(r(, p))

(30)

where r(, p) = l1(p)l(p) is the wigner rotation. the u() in (30) is the restriction of the unitary u() to
the dense subspace +, which remains invariant under the action of u() for all   so(3, 1). for the rotation free
lorentz boost one obtains in particular

(31)

(32)

where the boost l

 is a function of the real parameters p and not of the complex p:

(cid:0)u(l(p))(cid:1) |p = 0, j3, srji = |pj3, srji ,

thus in these representations the velocities p are real and the momenta p = mp become complex only through
the complex factor m = sr. it is this property that leads to the semigroup representations.

the relativistic gamow kets (28) are generalized eigenvectors of the invariant mass squared operator m 2 = pp 

with eigenvalue sr as can be seen immediately by using in (28) m 2  + in place of 
h|m 2
to prove (33) one needs to use the properties of the hardy class space [17]. similarly one shows that the |pj3, srji
are generalized eigenvectors of the momentum operators of (26) [17]

also represent relativistic gamow states with the complex mass sr = (mr  ir/2)2.
in contrast to the action of the lorentz subgroup (30), the translation subgroup u(x, 1) = eip x does not leave
the subspace + of h invariant. however there is a semigroup of time-like translations (x+, 1) into the forward
2)1/2x0  p.x  0 whose (restrictions to + of) u(x+, 1) leave the subspace +
light cone with px = (1 + p
2)1/2x0  p.x(cid:1)  0 , p  r3} = p+ form a semigroup and
invariant. the {(x+, )}|  so(3, 1), xwith (cid:0)(1 + p
their representatives u(x+, 1) are continuous operators on +, u(x+, )+  +. for the other (x, )  p this is
not fullled, cf. the analogy to the non-relativistic case [5].
for the particular case p = 0, x0 = t  0 we obtain the time translation into the forward direction generated by

the energy operator h = p0

h|eiht|p = 0, j3, srji = eisrth|p = 0, j3, srji = eimrtert/2h|p = 0, j3, srji

(36)

where t is time in the rest system.

thus relativistic gamow states are representations of p+ with spin j and complex mass sr = (mr  ir/2)2 
  im, for which the lorentz subgroup is unitarily represented. they are obtained from the resonance pole of

m2
the relativistic partial s-matrix sj(s), and thus lead to a representation of the j-th partial scattering amplitude

and b(s) is a background term not associated to the resonance pole at sr. the background is slowly varying in

v. summary

the gamow vector obeys an exact exponential decay law with a lifetime r given precisely by r = /r, according
to (36), and not by / or any other . the separation (37a) of an exact breit-wigner (37b) and the isolation of
an exactly exponential decaying gamow state g associated to each breit-wigner of each s-matrix pole is achieved
by the hypothesis (29) of the hardy class spaces. only for the gamow ket (28) can one prove (36) which leads to
the exact exponential decay law for the decay rate [18] and therewith to the precise relation r = /r. without
the postulate (29) this cannot be derived, though it has always been assumed on the basis of some approximate
derivations [19]. the gamow vector also helps to decide the debate about the right denition of the z-boson mass and
width [20]. according to (36) it is probably mr and certainly r (if one wants r = /r to hold) which should be

called the mass and width, not the peak position m of the breit-wigner (37b) and not mz =rm 2

the above are all features which one may welcome or easily accept for states that are to describe relativistic
resonances. in addition, gamow vectors have a semigroup time evolution t  0 (36), expressing irreversibility on the
microphysical level. this may be puzzling and disturbing to many, but a fundamental time asymmetry of quantum
physics has been noticed independently and in more general contexts [21,22]. the gamow kets can represent the
causal links between two events [22] and for microphysical states representing causal links a semigroup time
evolution is quite natural.

[7] the projectively equivalent irreducible representations (m, e, s)  (m, 0, s)  [m, s] of the galilei group are characterized
by non-relativistic mass m and spin s. in the direct product of [m1, s1] [m2, s2], the two spins are combined (using so(3)
clebsch-gordan coecients) to give the total spin s. then, using orbital angular momentum l for the relative orbital
motion, one couples s with l to form the total angular momentum j with the 3-component j3. this gives the basis vectors

[9] the use of the velocity eigenvectors has been suggested as early as 1965 by j. werle, on a symmetry scheme described
by non-lie algebra, ictp preprint, trieste, 1965, unpublished. it has been incorporated in the spectrum-generating group
approach for the mass and spin spectrum, a. bohm, phys. rev. 175, 1767 (1968). it has also been used to relate the form
factors for dierent decays to universal form factors for an su (3) multiplet in a. bohm, phys. rev. d 13, 2110 (1976),
and a. bohm and j. werle, nucl. phys. b 106,165 (1976). as dynamical stability group of p/m  the same idea has
been suggested by h. van dam and l.c. biedenharn, phys. rev. d 14, 405 (1976). velocity eigenstates were introduced
around 1990 as approximate states of heavy quark eective theory, again to reduce the number of independent form
factors: a.f. falk, h. georgi, b. grinstein and m.b. wise, nucl. phys. b 343, 1 (1990), h. georgi, proceedings of the

[17] the proof of (33), (34) and of the second equality in (28) is a consequence of the following theorem (titchmarsh) for hardy

class functions g(s)  h2
