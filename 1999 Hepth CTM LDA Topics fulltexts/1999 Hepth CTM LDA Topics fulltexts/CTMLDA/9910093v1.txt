abstract

we discuss an exotic class of kaluzaklein models in which the in-
ternal space is neither compact nor even of nite volume. rather than
using the usual compact internal space we consider the case where par-
ticles are gravitationally trapped near a four-dimensional submanifold
of the higher dimensional spacetime. a specic model exhibiting this
phenomenon is constructed in ve dimensions.

physics letters b159, 2225 (1985).

note: this rather old paper has recently been subject of renewed
interest due to the explosion of activity in the non-compact extra
dimensions variant of the kaluzaklein model.
it is not available
elsewhere on the internet, and in the interests of easy access i am
placing it on hep-th. the body of the paper is identical to the published
version. a small separate note has been added at the end of the paper.

introduction.

in kaluzaklein theories of the ordinary type spacetime
is assumed to be of the form m4  k; m4 a four-dimensional manifold and
k a compact manifold of internal co-ordinates. classically particles are
free to move around on k, thus k must be assumed to be very small. the
alternative we wish to begin to explore in this note is to somehow arrange for
an absence of translational invariance in the extra internal directions, and
then use gravity to trap particles near a four-dimensional submanifold. sug-
gestions along similar lines (without gravity) have been made by rubakov
and shaposhnikov [1]. for simplicity we consider the case of ve dimensions,
though the general procedure immediately generalizes to arbitrary dimen-
sionality. we rst give a general discussion that does not specify the partic-
ular form of the matter giving rise to the assumed metric, and only later do
we exhibit a particular example. the particular example we discuss also ex-
hibits a nice mechanism for generating a zero eective cosmological constant
from a nonzero ve-dimensional cosmological constant.

the metric. let the co-ordinates be x a = (t, x, y, z, ); a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5.

assume that the metric is of the form

g = e2() (dt)2 + d~x  d~x + (d)2.

without even having to look at eld equations it is immediately apparent
that there are four killing vectors and, therefore, four constants of the motion
for particles following geodesics

e =  p,



t! = p a gab   
xi!b

xi! = p a gab   



pi =  p,

t!b

= p i

= p 0 e2,

[i = 1, 2, 3].

a particle having a denite rest mass in the ve dimensional sense now
satises

(m5)2 = p a gab p b = e2(p 0)2 + ~p  ~p + (p 5)2.

consequently

with (e, ~p ) constants of the motion. thus if

p 5 = qe2 e2  (m5)2  ~p 2

e < q(m5)2 + ~p 2 sup(e)

any classical particle will be bound by the potential (). the experimental
nonobservation of any extra dimensions implies that e must rise very rapidly,
presumably with a length scale of order the planck mass.

to see how this gravitational trapping works quantum mechanically con-

sider the kleingordon equation in such a background metric:

g

a(g gab b) = (m5)2 .

then the solutions of the kleingordon equation are travelling waves in the
four usual directions but bound states in the fth co-ordinate
(t, ~x , ) = exp[i(t  ~k  ~x )] e/2 n(, ).

the excitation spectrum is found by solving

2n() = (m5)2 + (~k )2.

note that by choosing an appropriate normalization for t we can get

then v (, ) is bounded by

in the usual type of kaluzaklein model one obtains an innite tower of
excited states of ever increasing rest mass. for this exotic class of kaluza
klein models the spectrum is signicantly more complex. let 1
n (x) be the
inverse function to x = n(), then

n(~k ) = 1

n (cid:18)1

2 (cid:20)(m5)2 + ~k

2(cid:21)(cid:19) .

in particular the spectrum will not in general be lorentz invariant (i.e., will
not have a o(1, 3) symmetry). this should not be surprising since our ansatz
for the metric did not possess an o(1, 3) invariance. we would however like
to see o(1, 3) invariance show up in some approximation. to achieve this let
us dene n by

2 n(n) = (m5)2;

(i.e., ~k = 0).

now evaluate n() near  = n by using rst-order perturbation theory in
2; we see

n() = n(n) +

thus in the region where rst order perturbation theory is valid [this region
depends on the precise form of ()] we obtain an approximately lorentz
invariant spectrum with rest energy n and eective speed of light cn. (in
general relativity it is rather common to interpret c = g00 as the local
speed of light, observe that c2
n = hc()2i is just the expectation value of
this local speed of light for the nth excited mode).
up to this point we have nowhere used the einstein eld equations, the

discussion has accordingly been very general and qualitative.

the field equations. starting from the metric:

g00 = e2();

g11 = g22 = g33 = g55 = 1;

(all other components zero); it is a simple matter to compute the ricci tensor
and einstein tensor

r0

0 = r5

5 =    = e(e),

all other components vanish;

g11 = g22 = g33 = +e(e),

all other components vanish.

consider the einstein eld equations in the form

gab = +gab + tab,

we have

(e) = (+ + t11)e,

0 =  = t5

1) t0
2)
3) t11 = t22 = t33;

other components vanish.

so that we see that it is the pressure p = t11 = t22 = t33 that is
responsible for driving the  dependence of , while the density must be
independent of .

in fact, a stress energy tensor of this type can easily be constructed by
considering ve-dimensional electromagnetism with a constant electric eld
pointing in the  direction. take:

what has happened in this model is that a ve-dimensional cosmological
constant has conspired with a constant electric eld e = 2, to yield a
four-dimensional submanifold of zero four-dimensional cosmological constant,
together with a potential  = ln cosh(e) that traps particles in the fth
direction. the quantum mechanical trapping is in this case governed by the
schrodinger equation

we see that apart from a momentum independent shift the spectrum is in this
case exactly lorentzian. the appearance of two branches is not alarming.
these are just the usual particle antiparticle branches. it should be empha-
sized that it is quite possible to keep m4 small (compared to e). this requires
that the ve dimensional mass term be tachyonic. (e.g., (m5)2 = e2/4 for
massless matter). for some closing comments, note that there is no need for
the ve dimensional electromagnetism considered here to have anything
to do with ordinary electromagnetism. in addition, the total action of the
eld conguration considered here is zero.

s = z d5x g (r + 2 + 2l) = z d5x g (2e2 + e2 + e2) = 0.

thus we expect eld congurations of this type to be important for ve
dimensional quantum gravity even though they are not asymptotically at.
conclusion. we have looked at a general class of exotic kaluzaklein
models in which the particles of the observable world are gravitationally
trapped on a four dimensional submanifold of the real world. we have
seen that it is generally possible to get a low energy spectrum that approxi-
mately respects lorentz invariance, even though the metric ansatz does not
possess an o(1, 3) symmetry. finally we have exhibited a particular model
in ve dimensions that illustrates the discussed phenomena. the ve di-
mensional model is interesting in other respects. it exhibits an interesting
mechanism for cancelling a ve dimensional cosmological constant. in ad-
dition it exhibits a mechanism for taking what would be a tachyon in at
ve dimensional spacetime and producing an ordinary particle in the four
dimensional submanifold.

note added 14 years later:

submanifold variants of kaluzaklein theory, in which the (3+1) dimensional
matter is somehow constrained to live on a four-dimensional submanifold of
a higher dimensional spacetime have a very long history, going back at least
as far as joseph [1]. interest in this approach in a particle physics context,
using non-gravitational elds to eect the trapping, is largely due to the early
paper of rubakov and shaposhnikov [2].

after initial appearance of this present paper [3], the approach was some-
what modied by squires [4]. important related papers that further develop
this type of approach are those of lagunacastillo and matzner [5], and
of gibbons and wiltshire [6]. the eld then lay largely fallow for several
years [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], until the appearance of the review article by overduin
and wesson [12], which compares and contrasts some of the non-standard

approaches to kaluzaklein gravity that have been considered in the litera-
ture.

in the last year and a half interest has picked up considerably [13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. note that this topic is one for which e-prints are widely
scattered, appearing on any one of the hep-th, hep-ph, or gr-qc archives.

perhaps the best known of these recent papers are [18, 19, 21], which
work specically within a brane context arising from the low-energy limit
of a fundamental string theory.2 it should be borne in mind however, that
many features of the non-compact extra dimension paradigm are generic
to any low-energy eective eld theory, and are largely independent of ones
views regarding the full-edged theory of quantum gravity.
