introduction

the o(3) nonlinear sigma model has long been the subject of intense research due to its theoretical and phenomeno-
logical basis. this theory describes classical (anti) ferromagnetic spin systems at their critical points in euclidean
space, while in the minkowski one it delineates the long wavelength limit of quantum antiferromagnets. the model
exhibits solitons, hopf instantons and novel spin and statistics in 2+1 space-time dimensions with inclusion of the
chern-simons term.

the soliton solutions of the model exhibit scale invariance which poses diculty in the particle interpretation on
quantization. a popular means of breaking this scale invariance is to gauge a u(1) subgroup of the o(3) symmetry
of the model by coupling the sigma model elds with a gauge eld through the corresponding u(1) current.21 this
class of gauged o(3) sigma models in three dimensions have been studied over a long time1,2,3,4,5,6,7. initially the
gauge eld dynamics was assumed to be dictated by the maxwell term1. later the extension of the model with the
chern - simons coupling was investigated2. a particular form of self - interaction was required to be included in
these models in order to saturate the bogomolnyi bounds8. the form of the assumed self - interaction potential is
of crucial importance. the minima of the potential determine the vaccum structure of the theory. the solutions
change remarkably when the vaccum structure exhibits spontaneous breaking of the symmetry of the gauge group.
thus it was demonstrated that the observed degeneracy of the solutions of1,2 is lifted when potentials with symmetry
breaking minima were incorporated4,5. the studies of the gauged o(3) sigma model is important due to their intrinsic
interest and also due to the fact that the soliton solutions of the gauged o(3) chern-simons model may be relevant
in planar condensed matter systems9,10,11. recently gauged nonlinear sigma model was considered in order to obtain
self-dual cosmic string solutions12,13. this explains the continuing interest in such models in the literature1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
a particular aspect of the gauged o(3) sigma models where the gauge eld dynamics is governed by the maxwell
term can be identied by comparing the results of1 and5.
in1 the vaccum is symmetric and the n = 1 soliton
solution does not exist, n being the topological charge. here, solutions exists for n = 2 onwards. moreover, these
soliton solutions have arbitrary magnetic ux. when we achieve symmetrybreaking vaccum by chosing the potential
appropriately5 soliton solutions are obtained for n = 1.22these solutions have quntized magnetic ux and qualify as
magnetic vortices. it will be interesting to follow the solutions from the symmetrybreaking to the symmetric phase.
this is the motivation of the present paper.

we will consider a generalisation of the models of1 and5 with an adjustable real parameter v in the expression of
the self - interaction potential which interpolates between the symmetric and the symmetrybreaking vaccua. this
will in particular allow us to investigate the soliton solutions in the entire regime of the symmetrybreaking vacuum
structures and also to follow the collapse of the n = 1 soliton as we move from the assymmetric to the symmetric
phase. the solitons of the model are obtained as the solutions of the self  dual equation obtained by saturating the
bogomolnyi bounds. unfortunately, these equations fall outside the liouville class even after assuming a rotationally
symmetric ansatz. thus exact analytical solutions are not obtainable and numerical methods are to be invoked.

the organisation of the paper is as follows. in the following section we present a brief review of the o(3) nonlinear
sigma model. this will be helpful in presenting our work in the proper context. in section 3 our model is introduced.
general topological classications of the soliton solutions of the model has been discussed here.
in section 4 the
saturation of the self-dual limits has been examined and the bogomolnyi equations have been written down. also
the analytical form of the bogomolnyi equations has been worked out assuming a rotationally symmetyric ansatz.
these equuations, even in the rotationally symmetric scenario, are not exactly integrable. a numerical solution has
been performed to understand the details of the solution. a fourth order runge  kutta algorithm is adopted with
provision of tuning the potential appropriately. in section 5 the numerical method and some results are presented.
we conclude in section 6.

ii. o(3) nonlinear sigma models

it will be useful to start with a brief review of the nonlinear o(3) sigma model14. the lagrangian of the model is

given by,

here  is a triplet of scalar elds constituting a vector in the internal space with unit norm

l =

1
2

  

a = na  , (a = 1, 2, 3)
   = aa = 1

(1)

(2)
(3)

the vectors na constitute a basis of unit orthogonal vectors in the internal space. we work in the minkowskian space
- time with the metric tensor diagonal, g = (1, 1, 1).

the nite energy solutions of the model (1) satises the boundary condition

lima = a

(0)

(4)

at physiacal innity. the condition (4) corresponds to one point compactication of the physical innity. the physical
space r2 becomes topologically equivalent to s2 due to this compactication. the static nite energy solutions of the
model are then maps from this sphere to the internal sphere. such solutions are classied by the homotopy15

we can construct a current

2(s2) = z

k =

1
8

  (   )

which is conserved irrespective of the equation of motion. the corresponding charge

t = z d2xk0

=

1

8 z d2xij   (i  j)

gives the winding number of the mapping (5)16.

iii. our model - topological classification of the soliton solutions

in the class of gauged models of our interest here a u(1) subgroup of the rotation symmetry of the model (1) is
gauged. we chose this to be the so(2) [u(1)] subgroup of rotations about the 3 - axis in the internal space. the
lagrangian of our model is given by

l =

1
2

d  d 

1
4

f f  + u ()

d is the covariant derivative given by

d =  + an3  

(8)

(9)

the so(2) (u(1)) subgroup is gauged by the vector potential a whose dynamics is dictated by the maxwell term.
here f are the electromagnetic eld tensor,

u () is the self - interaction potential required for saturating the self - dual limits. we chose

f = a   a

u () = 

1
2

(v  3)2

(10)

(11)

where v is a real parameter. substituting v = 0 we get back the model of5 whereas v = 1 gives the model of1.

we observe that the minima of the potential arise when ,

which is equivalent to the condition

3 = v

2
1 + 2

2 = 1  v2

on account of the constraint (3). the values of v must be restricted to

|v|  1

3

(12)

(13)

(14)

the condition (13) denotes a latitudinal circle (i.e. circle with xed latitude) on the unit sphere in the internal space.
by varying v from -1 to +1 we span the sphere from the south pole to the north pole. it is clear that the nite energy
solutions of the model must satisfy (13) at physical innity. for v 6= 1 this boundary condition corresponds to the
spontaneous breaking of the symmetry of the gauge group and in the limit

|v|  1

(15)

the asymmetric phase changes to the symmetric phase. we call the potential (11) interpolating in this sense. in the
asymmetric phase the soliton solutions are classied according to the homotopy

1(s1) = z

(16)

instead of (5). in the symmetric phase, however, this new topology disappears and the solitons are classied according
to (5) as in the usual sigma model (1). a remarkable fallout of this change of topology is the disappearence of the
soliton with unit charge. the fundamental solitonic mode n = 1 (n being the vorticity) ceases to exist in the symmetric
phase. the modes corresponding to n = 2 onwards still persist but the magnetic ux associated with them ceases to
remain quantised.

in the asymmetric phase the vorticity is the winding number i.e. the number of times by which the innite physical
circle winds over the latitudinal circle (13). associated with this is a uniqe mapping of the internal sphere where the
degree of mapping is usually fractional. by inspection we construct a current

k =

1
8

[  d   d  f (v  3)]

(17)

generalising the topological current (6). the current (17) is manifestly gauge invariant and diers from (6) by the
curl of a vector eld. the conservation principle

thus automatically follows from the conservation of (6). the corresponding conserved charge is

k  = 0

using (17) and (19) we can write

t = z d2xk0

t = z d2x[

(20)

where r, are polar coordinates in the physical space and a = e  a. using the boundary condition (12) we nd
that t is equal to the degree of the mapping of the internal sphere. note that this situation is dierent from3 where
the topological charge usually diers from the degree of the mapping. in this context it is interesting to observe that
the current (17) is not unique because we can always add an arbitrary multiple of

with it without aecting its conservation. we chose (17) because it generates proper topological charge.

iv. self dual equations in the rotationally symmetric ansatz

in the previous section we have discussed the general topological classication of the solutions of the equations of
motion following from (8). in the present section we will discuss the solution of the equations of motion. the euler -
lagrange equations of the system (8) is derived subject to the constraint (3) by the lagrange multiplier technique

4

where

using (21) we get

d(d ) = [d(d )  ] + n3(v  3)

+ (v  3)3

 f  = j

j = n3  j and j =   d

dj = (v  3)(n3  )3

from (22) we nd,for static congurations

2a0 = a0(1  2
3)

from the last equation it is evident that we can chose

a0 = 0

(21)
(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

as a consequence we nd that the excitations of the model are electrically neutral.

the equations (21) and (22) are second order dierential equations in time. as is well known, rst order equations
which are the solutions of the equations of motion can be derived by minimizing the energy functional in the static
limit. keeping this goal in mind we now construct the energy functional from the symmetric energy - momentum
tensor following from (8). the energy

e =

1

2 z d2x(cid:20)d0  d0  di  di + (v  3)2  2(f 

0 f0

ff )(cid:21) .

for static conguration and the choice a0 = 0, e becomes

e =

1

2 z d2x[(di)  (di) + f 2

12 + (v  3)2]

several observations about the nite energy solutions can be made at this stage from (28). by dening

we get

 = 1 + i2

di  di = |(i + iai)|2 + (i3)2

the boundary condition (13) dictates that

  (1  v2)

2 ein

at innity. from (28) we observe that for nite energy congurations we require

a = e

n
r

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

on the boundary. this scenario is exactly identical with the observations of5 and leads to the quantisation of the
magnetic ux

 = z bd2x = zboundary

ard = 2n

(33)

5

the basic mechanism leading to this quantisation remains operative so far as v is less than 1. at v = 1, however, the
gauge eld a becomes arbitrary on the boundary except for the requirement that the magnetic eld b should vanish
on the boundary. remember that not all the vortices present in the broaken phase survives this demand. specically,
the n = 1 vortex becomes inadmissible.

now the search for the self - dual conditions proceed in the usual way. we rearrange the energy functional as

e =

1

2 z d2x[

1
2

(di  ij   dj )2 + (f 12  (v  3))2]  4t

equation (34) gives the bogomolnyi conditions

di  ij  dj = 0
f12  (v  3) = 0

(34)

(35)
(36)

which minimize the energy functional in a particular topological sector, the upper sign corresponds to +ve and the
lower sign corresponds to -ve value of the topological charge.

we will now turn towards the analysis of the self - dual equations using the rotationally symmetric ansatz18

1(r, ) = sin g(r) cos n
2(r, ) = sin g(r) sin n
3(r, ) = cos g(r)
na(r)

a(r, ) = e

r

from (12) we observe that we require the boundary condition

and equation (32) dictates that

g(r)  cos1 v as r  

a(r)  1 as r  

(37)

(38)

(39)

remember that equation (32) was obtained so as the solutions have nite energy. again for the elds to be well
dened at the origin we require

substituting the ansatz(37) into (35) and (36) we nd that

g(r)  0 or  and a(r)  0 as r  0

g (r) = 

sin g,

a(r) = 

(v  cos g)

n(a + 1)

(40)

(41)

(42)

where the upper sign holds for +ve t and the lower sign corresponds to -ve t.equations (41) and (42) are not exactly
integrable. in the following section we will discuss the numerical solution of the boundary value problem dened by
(41) and (42) with (38) to (40).

using the ansatz (37) we can explicitly compute the topological charge t by performing the integration in (19).the

result is

the second term of (43) vanishes due to the boundary condition (38). also, when g(0) = 0,

t = 

n
2

[cos g()  cos g(0)]

[v  cos g()]

and, when g(0) = ,

t =

n
2

(1  v)

t = 

n
2

(1 + v)

(43)

(44)

(45)

it is evident that t is in general fractional. due to (20) it is equal to the degree of mapping of the internal sphere.
this can also be checked explicitly.

from the above analysis we nd that g(0) = 0 corresponds to +ve t and g(0) =  corresponds to -ve t. we
shall restrict our attention on negetive t which will be useful for comparision of results with those available in the
literature. the boundary value problem of interest is then

with

a(r) = 

r
n

g (r) = 

r

n(a + 1)

sin g

(v  cos g)

g(0) = , a(0) = 0
g() = cos1 v, a() = 0

(46)

(47)

(48)

in addition we require a(r)  0 as r  . this condition follows from (46), (47) and (48) and should be considered
as a consistency condition to be satised by their soloutions.

v. numerical solution

the simultaneous equations (46) and (47) subject to the boundary conditions (48) are not amenable to exact
solution. they can however be integrated numerically. we have already mentioned the quenching of the n = 1
solution in the limit v  1. this is connected with the transition from the symmetry breaking to the symmetric
phase. the numerical solution is thus interesting because it will enable us to see how the solutions change as we
follow them from the deep assymetric phase (v = 0) to the symmetric phase (v = 1). in the following we provide the
results of numerical solution to highlight these issues.

let us note some details of the numerical method. a fourth order runge  kutta method was employed. the point
r = 0 is a regular singular point of the equation. so it was not possible to start the code from r = 0. instead, we
start it from a small value of r. the behaviour of the functions near r = 0 can be easily derived from (46) and(47)

(49)

(50)

here a is an arbitrary constant which xes the values of g and a at innity. in the symmetrybreaking phase the
numerical solution depends sensitively on the value of a.23there is a critical value of a, a = acrit for which the
boundary conditions are satised. if the value of a is larger than acrit the conditions at innity are overshooted,
whereas, if the value is smaller than the critical value g(r) vanishes asymptotically after reaching a maximum. the
situation is comparable with similar ndings elsewhere19. the values of g and a were calulated at a small value of r
using (49) and (50). the parameter a was tuned to match boundary conditions at the other end. interestingly, this
matching is not obtainable when n = 1 and v = 1. this is consistent with the quenching of the n = 1 mode in the
symmetric vacuum situation.

after the brief discussion of the numerical technique we will present a summary of the results. as may be recalled,
the purpose of the paper is to study the solutions throughout the asymmetric phase with an eye to the disappearence
of the n = 1 mode. accordingly proles of g and a will be given for n = 1, for dierent values of v. in gures 1 and
2 these proles are shown for v = 0, .2, .4, .6, .8. the corresponding magnetic eld distributions are given in gure 3.
another interesting issue is the change of the matter and the gauge proles with the topological charge. in gures 4
and 5 this is demonstrated for dierent n values for a constant v.

model nds possible applications in such diverse areas such as planar condensed matter physics9,10,11, gravitating
cosmic strings11,12 and as such is being continuously explored in the literature1,2,3,4,5,6,7,17. an interesting aspect of
the gauged o(3) sigma models is the qualitative change of the soliton modes in the symmetric and symmetrybreaking
vacuum scenario, as can be appreciated by a comparision of solutions given in1,5. in this paper we have considered a
gauged o(3) sigma model with the gauge eld dynamics determined by the maxwell term as in1,5. an interpolating
potential was included to invesigate the solutions in the entire symmetrybreaking regime . this potential depends
on a free parameter, the variation of which eects transition from the asymmetric to symmetric phase. we have
discussed the transition of the associated topology of the soliton solutions. the bogomolnyi bound was saturated to
give the self  dual solutions of the equation of motion. the self - dual equations are, however, not exactly solvable.
they were studied numerically to trace out the solutions in the entire asymmetric phase with particular emphasis on
the n = 1 mode. our analysis may be interesting from the point of view of applications, particularly in condensed
matter physics.

21 this is dierent from the minimal coupling via the topological current discussed previously20.
22 the disappearence of the n = 1 soliton has been shown to follow from general analytical method in17.
23 this should be contrasted with the symmetric vacuum solution where a may have arbitrary values.
