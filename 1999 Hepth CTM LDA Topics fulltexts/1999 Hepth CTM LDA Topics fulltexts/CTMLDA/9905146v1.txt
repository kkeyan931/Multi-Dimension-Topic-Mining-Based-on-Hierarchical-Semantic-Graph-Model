abstract

in this paper, we use only the equation of motion for an interacting
system of gravity, dilaton and antisymmetric tensor to study the black
brane solutions. by making use of the property of schwarzian deriva-
tive, we obtain the complete solution of this system of equations. for
some special values we obtain the well-known bps brane and black
brane solutions.

1 introduction

superstring theory [1, 2] is the leading candidate for a theory unifying all
matter and forces (including gravity, in particular). unfortunately, there are
ve such consistent theories, namely, so(32) type i , type iia, type iib,
e8  e8 heterotic and spin(32)/z2 heterotic theories. this richness is an
embarrassment for pure theorists. one hope is that all these ve superstring
theories are just dierent solutions of an underlying theory. in the last few
years this hope turns out to be true. the underlying theory is the so called
m theory [3, 4, 5]. one formulation of m theory is given in terms of matrix
theory [6]. nevertheless this formulation is not background independent. it
is dicult to use it to discuss non-perturbative problems and still we should
rely on the study of bps states. a thorough study of bps states in any
theory is a must for an understanding of non-perturbative phenomena.

in superstring theory and m theory, there is a plethora of bps states.
these bps states have the special property of preserving some supersymme-
try. in a low energy limit they are special solutions of the low energy su-
pergravity theory with poincare invariance. however there exists also some
other p-branes which dont preserve any supersymmetry and they are also
no longer poincare invariant. in nding these (soliton) solutions one either
resort to supersymmetry or make some simple plausible assumptions. there
is no denite reasoning that the so obtained solution is unique. the purpose
of this paper is to ll this gap.

it is also interesting to study soliton solutions for its own sake without
using any supersymmetric argument. quite recently there are some interests
[7, 8, 9, 11] in studying branes in type 0 string theories which have no fermions
and no supersymmetry in 10 dimensions [2]. in these string theories, we cant
use supersymmetric arguments. so it is important to push other symmtric
arguments to their limits.

in this paper we will study the coupled system of gravity (gm n ), dilaton
() and anti-symmetric tensor (am1m2mn1) in any dimensions. in a pre-
vious letter [12] we announced the complete solution of this system. here
we will give more details of the derivation of the complete solution and also
extend the solution to include black branes. after making a quasi-poincare
invariant ansatz for the metric and either electric or magnetic ansatz for the
anti-symmetric tensor, we derive all the equations of motion in some details.
a system of six ordinary dierential equations are obtained for ve unknown
functions (of one variable). after making some changes of the unknown

2

functions we solved four equations explicity. as we shown in [13], these re-
maining two equations (for one unknown functions) are mutually compatible
and a unique solution can always be obtained with appropriate boundary
conditions. the last equation can also be solved in the most generic case
by exploiating some properties of schwarzian derivative. the complete so-
lutions are given explicitly. by requiring that the solution approaches the
at space-time for r  , we found that there remains four free parame-
ters. for special values of these four parameters we got the well-known bps
brane solution and black brane solution [14, 15, 16]. we will not discuss the
physical property of these solutions [17]. for previous studies of soliton and
brane solutions in supergravity and string theories, see for example the re-
views [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. we note that some solutions are also generated via
sigma-models in [23]. these solutions are only special cases of our complete
solutions. in fact there is a large number of papers dealing with the brane
solution in one way or another. we apologize in advance that this paper is
not a review and we cant cite all of them because the purpose of this paper
is to obtain the most complete solution which wasnt achieved before.

2 the equations of motion and the ansatz

our starting point is the following action for the coupled system of gravity
gm n , dilaton  and anti-symmetric tensor am1mn1:

i =z ddxg (cid:18)r 

1
2

gm n m n  

1
2  n!

ea f 2(cid:19) ,

(1)

where a is a constant and f is the eld strength: f = da.

the equations of motion can be easily derived from the above action (1):

rm n =

m n  + sm n ,

1
2

m1(g eaf m1m2mn) = 0,
m (ggm n n ) =

a
2n!

n



n  1
n(d  2)

f 2gm n(cid:19) .

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

of course it is impossible to solve the above system of equations in their full
generality. to get some meaningful solution we will make some assumptions
by using symmetric arguments.

our ansatz for a p-dimensional black brane is as follows:

ds2 = e2a0(r)dt2 +

p

x=1

e2a(r)(dx)2 + e2b(r)dr2 + e2c(r)d2

d+1,

(6)

where d d+1 is the square of the line element on the unit d + 1 sphere which
can be written as follows:

d2

d+1 = d2

1 + sin2 1d2

2 +    + (sin 1    sin  d)2d2

d+1.

(7)

the brane is extended in the directions (t, x). when all a (including
a0) are equal, the brane is poincare invariant in the space-time spanned by
(t, x). we will call the ansatz (6) quasi-poincare invariant when all a are
equal except a0.

for the anti-symmetric tensor a, we have 2 dierent choices. the rst

choice is the electric case and we take the following form for a:

a = e(r) dx0  dx1      dxp.

(8)

the second choice is the magnetic case and we take the following form for
the dual potential a:

a = e(r) dx0  dx1      dxp.

(9)

we note that the relation between the antisymmetric tensor eld strength f
and its dual eld strength f ( d a) is:

f m1mn =

ea

1

g

1

(d  n)!

m1mnn1ndn fn1ndn.

(10)

by using this relation the ansatz (9) transform to an ansatz for f :

f = exp"  a 

p

x=0

a  b + ( d + 1) c#  d+1,

(11)

where  d+1 is the volume form of the sphere s d+1 with unit radius. as it
is well-known from duality, the equation of motion (3) becomes the bianchi

4

identity for f which is satised automatically. nevertheless the bianchih
identity for f becomes the equation of motion for f which is given as follows:

n1(g ea f n1n2ndn) = 0.

1

g

(12)

from now on we will discuss the electric case only.

denoting the coordinate index as (m) = (t, , r, i) and tangent index as
(a) = (t, , r,i), i.e. a bar over coordinate index, we introduce the following
moving frame:

et = ea(r) dt = et,
e  = ea(r) dx = e ,
er = eb(r) dr = er,
ei = ec(r) sin 1    sin i1di = ei.

from [13] we have the following results for the riemann curvature:

rab = f ab ea  eb,

(13)
(14)
(15)
(16)

(17)

where there is no summation ove a and b. f ab can be chosen to be sym-
metric and is 0 when a = b. by denition

we have

where we have dened f a as

f ab,

f a =xb

which can be computed to give the following results:

(34)

to obtain the equation of motion from eqs. (2) to (4) we also need to

know some expressions involving f . we have (for elementary solution)

a = e(r) dx0  dx1     dxn2,
f = da =  e(r) dr  dx0  dx1     dxn2,

f = g(n  1)! ( e(r))2 e2p p

=0 a2b,

m2mn,

fm n = 0,

for the rest cases,

and

f 2 = gm n fm n = n! ( e(r))2 e2p p

=0 a2b,

the equation of motion for gm n gives the following equations:

f rgrr =

for the (rr), () and (ij) components respectively. substituting all f a and
fm n into the above equations and setting c = b + ln r, a0 = a + 1

a = a ( = 1,   , p), we obtain the following four equations:

these six equations, eqs. (38)-(41), (43) and (44), consist of the complete
system of equations of motion for ve unknow functions: f (r), a(r), b(r),
(r) and (r). we will solve these equations completely in the next three
sections.

3 a first try at the solution

in this section we will try our best to solve the above system of equations by
elementary means. first it is easy to integrate eq. (44) to get


2 (r)

1

f

e(r)+a(r)da(r)+ db(r) r

d+1 = c0,

(45)

where c0 is a constant of integration. if we know the other four functions
f (r), a(r), b(r) and (r), this equation can be easily integrated to give (r):

e(r) = c0 z r

dr

1

2 (r) ea(r)+da(r) db(r)

f

r d+1

.

(46)

by using eq. (45), s can be written as follows:

s(r) = c0

e a

2 (r) d b(r)

r d+1

.

(47)

in order to solve the other equations we make a change of functions from

f (r), a(r), b(r) and (r) to (r), (r), (r) and y (r):

(r) = da(r) + db(r) +

ln f (r),

(r) = da(r) + db(r) 
(r) = (r) + a (a(r)  b(r)),
y (r) = a(r)  b(r).

ln f (r),

notice that our system of equations of motion is an over determined
system: ve unknown functions satisfying six equations. we have solved
four equations and there are two equations, eqs. (61) and (62), remaining
with one unknown function y (r). these two equations have the same form
as the equations derived in [13]. so the same proof given in [13] can be used
here to show that these two equations actually give no constraints on y (r)
and eectively there is only one equation, i.e., we can solve either one of
them and the other one will be satised automatically. in next section we
will solve eq. (61) completely.

now we start to solve eq. (61). let

eq. (61) becomes

(70)

the left-hand side of eq. (68) is the well-known schwarzian derivative of

the funtion g dened as:

g(cid:19)
s(g) (cid:18)g



1

g(cid:19)2
2(cid:18)g

.

thus, in order to solve eq. (68), one must nd a function g such that

s(g) =

2r2 +


2

r2 d2

(c2 + c1r2 d)2

.

4.1 notations and conventions

(71)

(72)

let f be an arbitrary function of r and f  be its derivative. the notation
f (r) always represents the value of the function f at r. similarly, f (r) is the
value of the function f  at r.

for two functions f and g, f g is their product1, and

is their division,
while the composition of two functions f and g is denoted by f  g. these
functions are dened by

f
g

(f g)(r) = f (r)g(r),

(cid:18)f
g(cid:19) (r) =
(f  g)(r) = f (g(r)).

f (r)
g(r)

,

(73)

(74)

(75)

for product of three or more functions we assume that the composition of two
functions has a higher rank of precedence of associavity than the products of

functions. nevertheless the symbol

is considered to be a pure entity and

f
g

cant be breaked. to understand these conventions we have the following
examples:

f g  h = g  h f = f (g  h),
g  h = (cid:18) f
f

g(cid:19)  h.

1we denote f f by f 2, f f f by f 3, and so on.

(76)

(77)

11

if k  c or r, we dene a function lk as the multiplication of its variable

with the number k, i.e.,

lk(r) = k r.

for convinence we also consider k itself as a constant function taking the
value k:

k(r) = k.

other functions such as the power function rs with real number s and the
exponential function er are denoted by ps and exp and other elementary
functions are denoted by their standard mathematical symbols.

with these conventions, we can derive the following derivative rules:

l
k = k,
p
s = s ps1
exp = exp,

k = 0,
arctan = 1
ln = p1,

1+p2

,

and the derivative rule for composition of function is

(f  g) = g f   g

(78)

(79)

4.2 some properties of the schwarzian derivative

now we list some elementary properties of the schwarzian derivative.

(1) if f and g are two functions, we have

s(f  g) = (g)2 s(f )  g + s(g).
for some numbers a, b, c and d, namely, f (r) =

(2) if f =

then

la + b
lc + d

(80)

ar + b
cr + d

,

(81)

s(cid:18) la + b

lc + d(cid:19) = 0.

this is the well-know fact that the fractional linear transformation is a global
conformal transformation of the complex sphere. by using this result we have

s(cid:18) la + b

lc + d  g(cid:19) = s(g).

(82)

that is to say, if g is a special solution of the equation s(f ) = r, the general
solution will be

f =

(83)

la + b
lc + d  g =

ag + b
cg + d

12

with constants a, b, c, d such that ad  bc = 1.

(3) for s  r, we have

s(lk) = 0,

,

s2  1
s(ps) = 
2p2
1
s(exp) = 
2
1
s(ln) =
2p2

,

,

s(tan) = 2,

s(arctan) = 

2

(1 + p2)2 .

4.3 a special solution of eq. (72)

the function r in eq. (72) is

r = 

d2  1
2p2

+

p2 d2

2

1

(c2 + c1 p2)2  p d.

for c1c2 > 0, we have

r = s(p d) + (p
= s(h1  p d)

where h1 is a yet-unknown function such that

s(h1) =

where k is the constant in eq. (65). note that in the third line we have

(96)

(97)

(98)

combining all the above steps, one nds that

r = s(tanlk  arctanlc1/c2  p d).

and a special solution of eq. (72) is found to be:

namely,

g0 = tanlk  arctanlc1/c2  p d,
g0(r) = tan k arctanrc1

r d! .

c2

the special case considered in [13] corresponds to k = 1. by using mathe-
matica, we have checked that the above function is indeed a solution of eq.
(72).

the general solution f of eq. (72) can be obtained according to eq. (83).
here we have three independent constants. this is the right number for a
third order ordinary dierential equation. so we obtain the complete solution
to eq. (72). substituting these into eq. (67), one can write down the complete
solution to eq. (61) which we turn in the next section.

5 the complete solution

the general solution of eq. (72) is obtained from the above special solution,
eq. (98), by an arbitrary sl(2, r) transformation:

from the above explicit result we see that there are 9 constants of integration.
most of them can be remove by chosing appropriate space-time transforma-
tions. in the next section we will consider the the case for c1 c2 < 0 and
requiring that the solution goes to at space-time for r  .

the black brane solution found in [14, 15, 16] is a special case of the

above solution with c1 =

change the isotropic coordinates used in this paper to the schwarzschild-

the above results gave exactly the black brane solution (126).

from the above results we see that the black brane solution is a two-
parameter solution. our complete solution is a four-parameter solution. a
detail study of the physical property of this more general solution is left for
a future publication.
