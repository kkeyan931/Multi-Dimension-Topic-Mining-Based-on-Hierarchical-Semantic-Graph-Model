abstract

a general method for solving the so-called quantum inverse scattering prob-
lem (namely the reconstruction of local quantum (eld) operators in term of
the quantum monodromy matrix satisfying a yang-baxter quadratic algebra
governed by an r-matrix) for a large class of lattice quantum integrable mod-
els is given. the principal requirement being the initial condition (r(0) = p ,
the permutation operator) for the quantum r-matrix solving the yang-baxter
equation, it applies not only to most known integrable fundamental lattice
models (such as heisenberg spin chains) but also to lattice models with arbi-
trary number of impurities and to the so-called fused lattice models (including
integrable higher spin generalizations of heisenberg chains). our method is
then applied to several important examples like the sln xxz model, the xy z
spin- 1

2 chain and also to the spin-s heisenberg chains.

introduction

one of the main challenging problem in the theory of quantum integrable models, after di-
agonalizing the corresponding hamiltonians, is to nd explicit and manageable expressions
for their correlation functions. this is well known to be a very hard problem in general
situations, even for quantum integrable models in two dimensions, and in fact besides the
models which can be connected to free fermions or which are in the conformal eld theory
class, very few explicit solutions to this problem have been obtained so far.

for example, in the case of the heisenberg spin- 1

2 chains [1], while the method for
diagonalizing the hamiltonian was designed in 1931 by h. bethe [2] (for the isotropic xxx
case), the rst manageable expressions for its correlation functions (in the thermodynamic
limit) have been given only in 1992 (in the massive regime) [3] and then in 1996 (in the
gapless regime) [4] by jimbo, miwa and their collaborators, however based on some nice
hypothesis, in particular, on the symmetry structure of the innite chain.

motivated by this problem, it was shown for the rst time in [5] that the explicit
solution of the quantum inverse scattering problem (namely the reconstruction of any local
spin operator at any site of the chain in terms of the elements of the quantum monodromy
matrix satisfying a yang-baxter algebra, and containing creation/annihilation operators of
bethe eigenstates of the hamiltonian) can be solved for this xxz spin- 1
2 model in a very
simple (multiplicative) way. moreover, using the algebraic bethe ansatz framework [6,7], it
was then used in [8] to derive explicit and simple expressions for the correlation functions of
this model, even in the presence of a non-zero magnetic eld. in the thermodynamic limit
(the limit of innite chain) it leads to multiple integral representations of these correlation
functions. in the zero magnetic eld limit, this approach gives then a complete proof of
results and conjectures previously obtained in [3, 4].

the elementary nature of the answer to the quantum inverse scattering problem, in
this very representative example among the models solvable by means of the algebraic
bethe ansatz method, was quite unexpected. the algebraic bethe ansatz method, also
called quantum inverse scattering method, appeared 20 years ago as a quantum analogue
of the classical inverse scattering problem approach to non-linear wave equations having
soliton solutions, in order to solve quantum integrable models in two dimensions. the
essential tools of this method are the quantum monodromy matrix satisfying quadratic
commutation relations (yang-baxter algebra) which structures constants are given by an r-
matrix solving the yang-baxter (cubic) equation [9,10]. it has been designed to diagonalize
the corresponding hamiltonians simultaneously with their associated commuting family of
integrals of motion [6, 7].
it is the quantum analogue of the direct part of the classical
inverse scattering problem method in its hamiltonian formulation [11], in which the lax
matrix is used to construct the monodromy matrix containing the action-angle variables
which linearize the dynamics. however, the inverse scattering problem part of the classical
theory, namely, the reconstruction of the local classical eld variables contained in the

1

lax matrix in terms of the elements of the monodromy matrix (and hence in terms of
the action-angle variables) using the gelfand-levitan-marchenko equations [1214], being
already a quite dicult problem to solve, it was not at all obvious to nd a direct way to
extend it to the quantum situation, although the motivations (form factors and correlation
functions) were very clear from the very beginning [1517].

the very remarkable feature of the solution to this problem given in [5] was not only
that the quantum inverse scattering problem can be solved explicitely, but also that both
its resulting expressions (reconstruction of the local spin operators at any site of the chain
in terms of a simple product of the quantum monodromy matrix elements) and their proofs
are very elementary. in turn, it essentially relies on the fact that the quantum r-matrix
r(, ) solving the yang-baxter equation reduces to the permutation operator when the
two spectral parameters  and  are equal.

this fact being almost a consequence of the yang-baxter equation itself, and hence
satised for very generic cases, it immediatly suggested that the quantum inverse scattering
problem can indeed be solved for almost all known quantum integrable (lattice) models1.
this is to be compared to the tentatives of solving the corresponding problem directly for
the continuum quantum integrable eld theories such as the sine-gordon model, using a
quantum version of the gelfand-levitan-marchenko equations, where it appeared to be
an extremely dicult problem to handle, due in particular to the presence of boundstates
[19, 20].

the results we will present here show that for lattice models at least (whatever com-
plicated is the corresponding spectrum) this problem admits a simple and purely algebraic
solution.

more precisely, let us consider a quantum lattice model associated to the nite dimen-
sional representations of some quantum algebra a [21, 22], and let wr(), where r + 1 is
the dimension, such representations depending on a spectral parameter  (here we have in
mind for example the nite dimensional evaluation representations of some quantum ane
algebra). let us suppose that the corresponding quantum r-matrix r(, ) is invertible
in any irreducible tensor product end(wrn()  wrn()) and reduces to the permutation
operator for equal spectral parameters. then, let the quantum lax operator ln() at site
n dening this lattice model be obtained as some nite dimensional representations of the
quantum r-matrix in end(v ()  wrn(n)) as,

ln(  n + 0)  lv wrn
= rv wrn

0n

0n

(  n + 0)

(  n)  end(v ()  wrn(n)),

where the auxiliary space v () (labelled by subscript 0) is for example a fondamental
(evaluation) representation of a, wrn(n) is the quantum local space at site n, and n is

superieure held in montreal in the summer 1999 [18].

an inhomogeneity parameter attached to the site n, the space of states of the model being
given by,

h  wr1(1)      wrn (n).

let ln() be choosen moreover such that we can associate to it an auxiliary quantum
lax operator ln() obtained by fusion [21, 2325] of ln() (meaning that its operator
matrix elements are functions of the ones contained in ln()) and given by the quantum
r-matrix in end(wrn()  wrn(n)). then, even in the general situation where the local
quantum space of states wrn(n) are dierent from one site to another, it is possible to
give an explicit and elementary solution of the reconstruction of the local operators at any
site n of the lattice in terms of elements of the quantum monodromy matrix associated to
ln(). in fact the resulting expressions for these local operators reconstructions and their
proofs are very direct generalizations of the ones given for the heisenberg xxz case in [5]
which is quite generic in this respect.

from a more universal point of view, which will be useful when considering the exten-
sion of our results to the eld theory case for which innite dimensional representations
should be considered, the solution of the quantum inverse scattering problem relies in turn
to the very simple fact that the associated universal r-matrix is the canonical (identity)
element in the corresponding double hopf algebra d(a) [26].

the main purpose of this article is to give a simple and general solution to the quantum
inverse scattering problem for any quantum integrable lattice model of the above type
solvable by means of the algebraic bethe ansatz method [6]. this result applies to most
known quantum lattice integrable models, even with arbitrary number of impurities at
dierent lattice sites, since our method takes into account the possibility to have any
chosen (nite dimensional) representations for the local space of states at each site which
could be dierent for dierent sites. we will also give explicit formulas for several known
interesting examples including not only the so-called fundamental lattice models (such as
xyz spin- 1
2 or sln xxz models, for which the result is essentially a direct copy of the case
described in [5]), but also for the more general cases of fused lattice models (such as the
higher spin generalisations of the heisenberg chains). in that last interesting situation, we
will also discuss the implications of these results for the classical inverse scattering problem.
the application of these results to the actual computation of correlation functions of

the above models will be considered in forthcoming publications.

this article is organized as follows.

in section 2, we rst recall the results for the
spin- 1
2 xxz heisenberg spin chain as given in [5], which will be a guideline all along the
article. then the results are extended in a quite direct way to a large class of lattice
quantum integrable models in section 3. in section 4, we apply these results to the so-
called fundamental lattice models for which the quantum lax operator is given essentially
by the corresponding quantum r-matrix, namely, for which in particular the auxiliary and

3

quantum spaces are isomorphic. in section 5, we consider the so-called fused lattice models,
with the example of the xxx spin-s model. some conclusions and comments are given in
the last section.

2 solution of the quantum inverse problem for the heisen-

berg spin-1/2 chain

in this section, we recall the solution of the quantum inverse problem which was given
in [5] in the case of the xxz spin-1/2 heisenberg chain.

the xxz heisenberg chain of length n corresponds to the following hamiltonian,

n

m+1  1)(cid:9),

(1)

hxxz =

xm=1(cid:8)x

mx

m+1 + y

m+1 + (z

where 
m,  = x, y, z, are the pauli matrices acting in the two-dimensional space hm at
site m,  = cosh  is the anisotropy parameter, the particular case  = 1 corresponding
to the xxx chain. we impose periodic boundary conditions.

in the algebraic bethe ansatz framework, the corresponding quantum r-matrix is

r(, ) =


where

0 b(, )
0 c(, )

with the function  dened as

() = 

in the xxx case,

() = sinh() in the xxz case.

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

the r-matrix is a linear operator in the tensor product of two two-dimensional linear spaces
v1  v2, where each vi is isomorphic to c2, and depends generically on (the dierence of)
two spectral parameters 1 and 2 associated to these two vector spaces. it is denoted by
r12(1, 2) or by r12(1  2). such an r-matrix satises the yang-baxter equation,

r12(1, 2) r13(1, 3) r23(2, 3) = r23(2, 3) r13(1, 3) r12(1, 2).

(7)

4

moreover, it is unitary, except for a nite number of values of the spectral parameter (such
that b(1, 2) = c(1, 2)),

r12(1  2) r21(2  1) = 1,

(8)

and reduces to the permutation operator for a particular value of the spectral parameter,
r12(0) = p12

identifying one of the two linear spaces in the r-matrix with the quantum local space

hn at site n, one obtains the quantum l-operator of the model at site n as

ln(, n) = r0n(  n),

(9)

where n is an arbitrary (inhomogeneity) parameter dependent on the site n. the hamilto-
nian (1) corresponds to the homogeneous case where all the inhomogeneity parameters n
are equals. the subscripts mean here that r0n acts on the tensor product of the auxiliary
space v0  c2 by the quantum space hn at site n. the quantum monodromy matrix of
the total chain is then dened as the ordered product of all l-operators along the chain,

t0()  t0,1...n (; 1, . . . , n ) = r0n (  n ) . . . r01(  1),

and can be represented in the auxiliary space v0 as a 2  2 matrix,

t () =(cid:18)a() b()
c() d()(cid:19) ,

(10)

(11)

whose matrix elements a, b, c, d are linear operators on the quantum space of states of

the chain h =
c2  c2:

n

n=1

hn. their commutation relations are given by the following relation on

r12(, ) t1() t2() = t2() t1() r12(, ),

(12)

with the usual tensor notations t1() = t ()  id and t2() = id  t ().

in the algebraic bethe ansatz framework, the matrix elements of the monodromy ma-
trix are used to construct the eigenstates of the hamiltonian. in particular, the transfer
matrices t(), which are the trace a() + d() of the corresponding monodromy matrices
(11), commute with each other for dierent values of the spectral parameter , and the
hamiltonian (1) can be obtained from these transfer matrices (in the homogeneous case)
by means of trace identities. in this context, b and c are used respectively as creation and
annihilation operators of bethe eigenstates. the common eigenstates of the hamiltonian
and the commuting transfer matrices are constructed by successive actions of operators

5

b(j) on a reference state | 0 i, which in this case is the ferromagnetic state with all spins
up, for any set of n spectral parameters {j, 1 6 j 6 n} solution of bethe equations.

the quantum inverse problem consists in reconstructing the local operators, which here
are the local spin operators s = sx isy, sz at a given site i of the chain, with s = 1
2 ,
 = x, y, z,  being the standard pauli matrices, in terms of the matrix elements a, b,
c, d of the monodromy matrix used to construct the eigenstates of the hamiltonian. this
was done in [5], where we obtained the following result :

(16)

note that the expressions (13) - (16), which are given here in the more general case
with inhomogeneity parameters j, are in particular valid in the homogeneous limit where
all parameters j are set equals to zero.

these formulae were used in [5] to obtain an explicit determinant representation for
the form factors of the nite chain, and in [8] to derive integral representations for general
correlation functions of the chain in a magnetic eld at the thermodynamic limit.

the proof of (13)(15) proposed in [5] was very simple. it relies essentially on the fact
that these formulae can be easily proven, using that r(0) = p , for an operator acting on
the rst site on the chain (cf. lemma 4.2 of [5]), and that the problem can be reduced to
this case by means of a propagator, which is a shift operator from site 1 to site i, and which
is given as some product of r-matrices or as a product of transfer matrices (cf. equations
(4.3) and (4.4) of [5]). in [5], the propagator was also expressed in terms of factorizing
f -matrices, but it is clear that its properties rely actually only on its expression (equation
(4.3) of [5]) as a product of r-matrices. thus, the proof proposed in [5] is quite general,

6

and can be extended to a large class of lattice integrable models, as it will be shown in
the next sections. in particular, its generalisation to fundamental models is quite obvious
(see section 4 for some other interesting examples), but we will also show that one can
obtain an explicit reconstruction for fused lattice models as well, such as for example the
heisenberg chains of higher spins (see section 5).

3 general solution for lattice models

in this section, we show that the resolution of the quantum inverse problem given in [5] in
the case of the xxz spin-1/2 heisenberg chain is quite general and can be extended to a
large class of lattice models.

let a be a hopf algebra, for example a yangian or a quantum ane algebra, which
admits a family of nite dimensional evaluation representations wr(), where r + 1 is the
dimension, depending on a spectral parameter . suppose that, for any irreducible tensor
product of two such representations wr()  ws(), there exist a corresponding r-matrix
rwrws(  ) solving the yang-baxter equation, and which is unitary (except for a nite
number of values of the spectral parameter). suppose moreover that the matrix rwrwr (),
acting on the tensor product of any two spaces with same dimension r + 1, reduces to a
permutation operator for a particular value of the spectral parameter :

rwrwr (0) = p wrwr .

(17)

for notation conveniences, we will consider the additive spectral parameter case. however,
it will be clear all along the results and proofs, that our method being purely algebraic,
it extend to more general situations as well. let us also suppose that there exists some
fusion rules which allow the explicit construction, from the r-matrices rv v () associated
to fundamental representations v (), of the r-matrices associated to higher dimensional
representations:

rwrws() = f wrws,v (cid:2)rv v ()(cid:3) .

then let us consider a quantum lattice model, solvable by means of algebraic bethe
ansatz, whose space of states is isomorphic to a tensor product of evaluation representa-
tions:

(18)

h  wr1(1)      wrn (n).

here, wrn(n) is the quantum local space at site n, and n is an inhomogeneity parameter
attached to the site n. let us dene the quantum l-operator of the model at site n by

ln(  n + 0)  lv wrn
= rv wrn

0n

0n

(  n + 0)

(  n)  end(v ()  wrn(n)),

7

where 0  c, the auxiliary space v () (labelled by subscript 0) being a fondamental
(evaluation) nite dimensional representation of a. the monodromy matrix, whose matrix
elements are used to create eigenstates of the hamiltonian in the framework of algebraic
bethe ansatz, is given by the ordered product of these l-operators along the chain:

t0,1...n () = l0n (  n + 0) . . . l01(  1 + 0).

(19)

in this context, the quantum inverse problem consists in reconstructing local operators
n , 1 6  6 (rn + 1)2, which generate the local quantum space end(wrn) at any given

e
site n of the chain, in terms of the operator entries of the monodromy matrix (19).

the idea of this reconstruction, for an operator e

n acting at a given site n of the chain,
is to consider an auxiliary quantum l operator for which the dimension of the auxiliary
space w is equal to the dimension of the local quantum space wrn at site n, and such that
this lax operator at site n reduces to the permutation operator (17) in a particular value
of the spectral parameter. thus, we dene the following auxiliary lax operator for any site
i of the chain, with an auxiliary matrix space w isomorphic to the space of states wrn,
for a given n,

l(rn)

0i

(  i + 0) = r

w wri
0i

(  i),

acting in the tensor product w  wri  wrn  wri, and such that it can be obtained
by fusion from our starting quantum lax operator ln. here and in the following, the
upperscript (rn) means that the auxiliary space choosen to construct the corresponding
object is isomorphic to wrn. for this special choice of the auxiliary space, let us note
t (rn)() and t(rn)() the corresponding monodromy and transfer matrices:

t (rn)()  t (rn)
t(rn)()  t(rn)

0,1...n () = l(rn)
1...n () = tr0(cid:16)t (rn)

0n (  n + 0) . . . l(rn)
0,1...n ()(cid:17) .

we have the following proposition:

01 (  1 + 0),

(20)

(21)

proposition 1. an operator e
n  end(wrn) in a given site n of the chain can be ex-
pressed in the following way in terms of the monodromy matrix t (rn)
0,1...n (n) constructed
with an auxiliary space w  wrn and of the transfer matrices constructed with the dier-
ent auxiliary spaces isomorphic to the dierent quantum local space of states wri for any
site index i, t(ri)(i), 1 6 i 6 n:

themselves due to the yang-baxter relation),

(for any choice of the auxiliary space labelled by 0) is given by

t1n t0,1...n () t 1

1n = t0,n...n 1...n1().

(23)

proof. the expression (23) can be proved by induction on n. the transfer matrix t(rn)

constructed with auxiliary space w isomorphic to wrn can be expressed as a product of
r-matrices:

it should be noted that we have considered here the general inhomogeneity case, but
of course, our result applies and simplies for the homogeneous case where all parameters
n are equal.

proposition 1 gives thus the reconstruction of local operators at site n in terms of
the matrix elements of the monodromy matrix the auxiliary space of which has the same
dimension as the quantum space of states at site n. but the creation and annihilation
operators used when solving the model by means of algebraic bethe ansatz are elements
of the monodromy matrix t1...n () (19) the auxiliary space of which is a fundamental
representation of the algebra a. one can use then the fusion rules (18) to reexpress the
matrix elements of the monodromy matrix (20), which appear in the expression (22) of
proposition 1 in terms of those of (19), solving the problem. we will see some example in
the next sections.

4 fundamental lattice models

in this section, we apply the general formula of section 3 in the special case of fundamental
lattice models. fundamental lattice models are characterized by the fact that the quantum
space of states at any site n of the lattice is given by the fundamental representation of the
corresponding quantum algebra and is isomorphic to the auxiliary matrix space. hence,
the lax operator is just given by the quantum r-matrix in the tensor product of the
fundamental representation by itself and indeed reduces to the permutation operator in
this tensor product when the spectral parameter is equal to zero,

ln(, n)  lv vn
= rv v

0n (  n)
0n (  n)  end(v ()  v (n)),

where v is a fundamental representation. the space of states is here

h  v (1)      v (n ).

10

the quantum monodromy matrix is given by

t0,1...n () = l0n(, n) . . . l01(, 1),

and the transfer matrix is dened as usual by its trace in auxiliary space v0,

t1...n () = tr0 (t0,1...n ()) .

as a consequence, the formula (22) of proposition 1 applies directly to give the reconstruc-
tion of any local operator e

n acting at a given site n of the chain,

0 denotes the operator e

where e
n acting in the auxiliary space. note that the homoge-
neous case is obtained as usual by putting all inhomogeneity parameters n to zero in the
above formula.

let us stress here that it is a very direct copy of our original formula (16) given in [5]
for the case of the xxz spin- 1
2 chain, which is completely generic in this respect. this
formula is of course valid for both inhomogemeous and homogeneous models which are
obtained simply in the limit where all inhomogeneity parameters n are set equal to zero.

4.1 the sln+1 xxz model

the quantum r-matrix of this model, solving the yang-baxter equation and associated to
a fundamental representation of uq(sln+1), is dened by the following (n + 1)2  (n + 1)2
matrix [2729],

r(n)() =

er(n)  e r(n)

e  e + qx
e  e + q1x

e  e + (q  q1)x<
e  e  (q  q1)x<

e  e,

e  e,

where e is the elementary (n + 1)  (n + 1)-matrix with only one non-zero element,
e
ij = i,j,. note that, r(0) = p , the permutation operator. for homogeneous models,
the quantum lax operator being directly equal to this r-matrix, the quantum monodromy
matrix is given by,

0,1...n () = r(n)
t (n)

0n () . . . r(n)

02 ()r(n)

01 ().

(26)

the transfer matrices t(n)() = tr0 t (n)

values of the spectral parameters , and one can dene the local quantum hamiltonian by
means of trace identities,

h(n) = (q  q1)

(27)

the simultaneous diagonalization of the transfer matrix and of the hamiltonian is given by
the so-called nested bethe ansatz [30, 31]. the solution of the quantum inverse scattering
problem consists in reconstructing the local operators

(29)

this expression (29) gives the reconstruction of the quantum local operators for the homo-
geneous chain and is a direct generalization of (16). it is clear from the general formulas
of the preceding section that it is also possible to write a similar formula for the inhomo-
geneous case as well.

4.2 the xyz spin- 1

,

d(u) = k sn() sn(u),

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

where sn(u)  sn(u; k) is the jacobi elliptic function of modulus k, 0 6 k 6 1. the
constants in the hamiltonian are related to the parameters as,

jx = 1 + k sn2(),
jy = 1  k sn2(),
jz = cn() dn().

(35)

(36)

(37)

then it is obvious that this r-matrix reduces to the permutation operator p for u = 0.
moreover it is unitary up to a numerical factor that can be taken into account in all our
computations. dening the quantum lax operator as being the r-matrix itself, all the
requirements for applying our above general formula are satised. hence, we just obtain
the reconstruction of any spin operator at site n to be given by the same formula as
in the xxz case where we have just to replace the operators a, b, c, d in (16) by the
corresponding ones from the xy z model.

5 quantum inverse problem for higher spin xxx chains

in this section, we consider the integrable generalization of the xxx model with local spin
variables s
n realizing a representation of sl2 of dimension l + 1 (spin l/2). this model is
given by a lax operator l(1)
0n (), acting on the tensor product of a 2-dimensional auxiliary
space v0 by the local quantum space hn  cl+1 at site n,

l(1)

0n () =

1

 + l(cid:18) + ( l

s+
n

2 + sz
n)

s
n

 + ( l

2  sz

n)(cid:19) .

(38)

13

as in the spin 1/2 case, the corresponding monodromy matrix, given by the ordered product
of these l-operators with 2-dimensional auxiliary space along the chain,

0,1...n () = l(1)
t (1)

0n () . . . l(1)

01 (),

can be written on the auxiliary space v0 as a 2  2 matrix,

t (1)

c() d()(cid:19) ,
0,1...n () =(cid:18)a() b()

(39)

(40)

whose matrix elements are used to construct eigenstates of the hamiltonian. the commu-
tation relations (12) of these matrix elements are given by the same r-matrix (2) as in the
spin 1/2 case.

the hamiltonian of this model is given by means of trace identities involving the
transfer matrices t(l)() constructed from l-operators l(l)
0n() with (l + 1)-dimensional
auxiliary space. this hamiltonian describes nearest-neighbour interactions, which follows
from the fact that l(l)
0n () with
higher dimensional (s + 1)-auxiliary space can be constructed from (38) by the fusion
procedure [23]. more precisely, if p +
a1...as is the projector (symmetrizer) onto the (s + 1)-
dimensional subspace v(a1...as) of the tensor product va1      vas of s auxiliary spaces
vai  c2, one has

0n(0) reduces to the permutation p0n. the l-operators l(s)

(41)

remember that, in all this section, the dimension of the local quantum spaces is xed to
be l + 1, and that the upperscript (s) labels only the dimension of the auxiliary space (to
be s + 1).

the quantum inverse problem consists here in reconstructing the local spin operators
s
n in terms of the matrix elements a, b, c, d of the monodromy matrix (40) with 2-
dimensional auxiliary space. from proposition 1, we know how to reconstruct them in
terms of the matrix elements of the monodromy matrix t (l)() with auxiliary space of
dimension l + 1:

s

n =nt(l)(0)on1

tr0(cid:16)s

0 t (l)

0,1...n (0)(cid:17) nt(l)(0)on

the problem is thus to express the quantities

(s)

 () = tr0(cid:16)s

0 t (s)

0,1...n ()(cid:17)

14

.

(42)

(43)

for any component  of the spin operator and for any integer s 6 l. to do this, one uses
the fact that the monodromy matrix t (s)
0,1...n with (s + 1)-auxiliary space can be obtained
by fusion in terms of the monodromy matrix t (1)
0,1...n with 2-dimensional auxiliary space,
similarly as in (41):

t (s)
(a1...as),1...n () = p +
. . . t (1)

s  1

a1,1...n(cid:16) +

(cid:17) . . . t (1)

2

as,1...n(cid:16) 

s  1

2

(cid:17) p +

a1...as.

(44)

this fusion procedure enables us to formulate the following lemma:
lemma 3. for any integer s 6 l, the quantity (s)
 () dened by equation (43) has the
following expression in terms of the elements (1)
 () of the monodromy matrix (40) and of
the transfer matrices t(s)() corresponding to (s + 1)-dimensional auxiliary space (s 6 s):

(s)

 (u) =

s

xk=1

t(sk)(cid:16)u +

 (cid:16)u +

2k  s  1

2

(cid:17) t(k1)(cid:16)u +

k  s  1

2

(cid:17).

(45)

proof. we will show the formula (45) by recursion on s, for s 6 l. first, note that it is
satised for s = 1. moreover, it can be easily shown also for s = 2.

suppose now that it is satised until a given s < l. when fusioning a spin s/2 with spin
1/2 representation, one has the following block-triangular decomposition for the product
of the corresponding monodromy matrices [25, 33]:

t (1)

a1,1...n(cid:0)u +

s + 1

2

a2,1...n (u) =

(cid:1) t (s)
=  t (s+1)



(a1a2),1...n (u + 
2 )

0
2 )t (s1)

fl(u + s

ha1a2i,1...n (u  

2 )! ,

(46)

where the block structure is in accordance with the decomposition

va1  va2  v(a1a2)  vha1a2i,

va1  c2,
va2  cs+1,
v(a1a2)  cs+2, vha1a2i  cs,

and where the function fl(u) is the quantum determinant of the monodromy matrix (40).
taking the trace in (46), one obtains the well-known fusion equation for the transfer ma-
trices:

t(1)(u +

s + 1

2

) t(s)(u) = t(s+1)(u +


2

) + fl(u +

s
2

) t(s1)(u 


2

).

(47)

15

in the same way, decomposing the component of the spin s
s
ha1a2i on v(a1a2)  vha1a2i, one can take the trace of the quantity

a1a2 = s

a1 + s

a2 into s

(a1a2) +

a1a2 t (1)
s

a1,1...n (u +

s + 1

2

) t (s)

a2 ,1...n (u)

in (46), which leads to the following recursion relation for (s)

 (u):

(1)

 (u +

s + 1

2

) t(s)(u) + t(1)(u +

s + 1

2

) (s)

 (u)

= (s+1)



(u +


2

) + fl(u +

s
2

) (s1)



(u 


2

).

(48)

one can then easily show, replacing (s)
(u) by the corresponding expressions
(45) in (48), and using the recursion relation (47) to reconstruct the transfer matrices which
appear in each term of the sum, that one obtains also the expression (45) for (s+1)
(u). (cid:3)

 (u) and (s1)





consequently, the solution of the quantum inverse problem for local spin operators is

given by the following proposition:

(51)

note that the above formulae can be easily generalized to an inhomogeneous model.

remark 1. the transfer matrices t(s)(u) can be expressed (using (47)) in terms of t(1)(u)
and the quantum determinant (see [25, 33, 34]).

16

remark 2. the proof given here being quite general and relying essentially on the recursion
relation (46) with respect to the dimension of the auxiliary space, similar results can be
obtained for xxz and xyz higher spin chains.

it is quite interesting to examine the quasi-classical limit of the above formulas. this
amounts to consider the limit in which the quantum parameter  goes to zero while the
spin s of the quantum representation space goes to innity, their product (the classical
spin) being kept xed.
in the above formulas, the sum on spin and shifts becomes an
integral in this limit.

in this context, it is worth mentioning that while the solution to the quantum inverse
scattering problem admits a very simple solution (essentially as a product of elements
of the quantum monodromy matrix), the semi-classical limit of this expression (which
is equivalent to the gelfand-levitan-marchenko equations) is more involved. this is in
particular due to the fact that while every term in the multiplicative reconstruction formula
for the quantum model becomes in this limit a function of the classical spin, and commutes
with any other term in this expression, there is an accumulation of such terms which
number becomes of the order s (i.e, of order 1
 in the limit   0). hence, this gives non-
trivial contribution (coming from non-commutative eects) in the classical limit , explaining
in some sense why the classical case seems a priori much more involved than the quantum
one. these eects results in eective universal backlund transformations coming from
the multiple dressing of the a, b, c, d operators in the quantum formulas by transfer
matrices. it also shed some light on the reason why the direct quantization of the gelfand-
levitan-marchenko equations is a priori a very dicult problem to deal with, since it would
be very hard to guess the mutiplicative quantum formula from it. we expect do discuss
this classical limit in a separate publication.

6 conclusion

we have shown in this article that the quantum inverse scattering problem can be solved
for almost all known quantum integrable lattice models with arbitrary nite dimensional
local space of states (which could be dierent from one site to another). our derivation
relies on the unitaity of the quantum r-matrix, its initial condition, r(0) = p , and on the
existence of fusion rules relating quantum lax operators associated to dierent auxiliary
spaces. hence, our results apply not only to the fundamental lattice models (such as the
heisenberg spin chains and their higher rank algebra generalisations) but also to lattice
models with arbitrary number of impurities and to the so-called fused lattice models, like
the higher spin integrable generalisations of heisenberg chains. we would like to stress
that besides some elementary technical details, the fundamental lattice model situation,
both in the result and in its proof, is a very direct copy of our original derivation for the

17

xxz spin 1
2 case [5]. for other more general models, fusion should be used, leading to nice
dressed formulas such as (49)(51). another interesting case, that we have not considered
here, concerns quantum integrable lattice eld theory models, such as the sine-gordon
model. in this context, we will have to deal with auxiliary quantum lax operators having
innite dimensional representation auxiliary space, and also to dene a trace operation
for such representations. we expect the resulting reconstruction expressions for the local
quantum elds to be given by formulas very similar to the innite spin limit of the above
result for spin-s heisenberg chains.

these results can now be applied to the computation of form factors and correlation

functions of these models along the line we described in [8].

as a last remark, we note that after the completion of this manuscript, a paper, strongly
inspired by our original work [5], and the seminar given by one of us [18], appeared in the
hep-th/preprint archive (hep-th/9910253), also dealing with the quantum inverse problem,
however only in the particular case of fundamental graded lattice models.
