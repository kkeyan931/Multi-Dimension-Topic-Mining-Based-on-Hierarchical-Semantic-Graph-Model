solutions lower-dimensional gauged supergravities, conjectured ads/cft correspondence led revival interest deriving supergravities kaluza-klein reduction fundamental string theories m-theory = 10 = 11. long believed many gauged supergravities arise kaluza-klein reduction eleven-dimensional supergravity type iia iib supergravities certain spherical internal spaces. linearised level, well established spectra massless supermultiplets maximal gauged supergravities = 4 = 7 coincide coming appropriate truncations s4 s7 reductions = 11 supergravity . likewise, spectrum maximal gauged supergravity = 5 known arise truncation s5 reduction type iib supergravity . although linearised results rather easily established, much harder de- termine whether truncations massless supermultiplets consistent full non-linear level. key point concern non-linear interactions included, possibility exists full untruncated reduction, source terms built purely elds massless multiplet might arise eld equations lower-dimensional massive multiplets, making inconsistent set massive elds zero. indeed, hard establish sphere reduction generic higher- dimensional theory, denitely couplings, making consistent truncation massless sector impossible. thus sphere reductions (with truncation massless supermultiplet) supergravities consistent, must re- markable special properties particular theories. general arguments suggesting reductions supergravity multiplet always consistent constructed . early indications properties found s7 reduction = 11 super- gravity . subsequently, complete demonstration consistency case presented {$9711200$}, although construction rather implicit. recently, somewhat less implicit construction presented easier case reduction ansatz s4 reduction = 11 supergravity, give maximal gauged supergravity = 7 {$9711200$}. analogous results obtained s5 reduction type iib supergravity, 1 however, consistency reduction remains conjectural. although one would certainly like know complete reduction ansatze cases, many purposes practice useful fully explicit ansatz restricted subset elds entire maximal massless multiplet. example, known charged anti-de sitter black hole solutions gauged supergravities make use gauge elds maximal abelian subgroup full gauge group. thus, example, one interested oxidising solutions back higher dimension original parent supergravity, would sucient consistent kaluza-klein reduction ansatz abelian truncation full gauged theory. kaluza-klein ansatze sort constructed {$9711200$}, s7 s4 reductions = 11 supergravity, s5 reduction type iib supergravity. cases fully non-linear bosonic ansatze obtained. case s5 reduction, ansatz fully consistent, reductions = 11, ansatze fully consistent within limited subspaces solutions, including charged ads black holes. another way making reductions managable, maintaining full consis- tency, truncate maximal supermultiplet smaller supergravity multiplet. this, full non-linear ansatz s4 reduction = 11 n = 1 su (2)- gauged supergravity = 7 obtained {$9711200$}. although principle subsumed n = 2 results {$9711200$}, practice full explicitness n = 1 results makes transparent usable cases n = 1 truncation sucient. similar vein, bosonic sector full n = 2 su (2)-gauged supergravity = 6 recently obtained, explicit consistent (local) s4 reduction massive type iia
