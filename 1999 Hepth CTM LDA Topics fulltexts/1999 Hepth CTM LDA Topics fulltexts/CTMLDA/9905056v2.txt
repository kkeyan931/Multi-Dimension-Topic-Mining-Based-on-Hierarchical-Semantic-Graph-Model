abstract

recently the space-time congurations of a set of non-threshold bound

states, called the (f, dp) bound states, have been constructed explicitly for

every p with 2  p  7 in both type iia (for p even) and type iib (for p
odd) string theories by the present authors. by making use of the sl(2, z)

symmetry of type iib theory we construct a more general sl(2, z) invariant

bound state of the type ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) in this theory from the (f, d5)

bound state. there are actually an innite number of (m, n) strings forming

bound states with (m, n) 5-branes, where strings lie along one of the spatial

directions of the 5-branes. by applying t-duality along one of the transverse

directions we also construct the bound state ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) in type

iia string theory. then we give a list of possible bound states which can be

obtained from these newly constructed bound states by applying t-dualities

along the longitudinal directions as well as s-dualities to those in type iib

theory.

i. introduction

this is in sequel to our series of study on a new kind of bound states that exist in

both type iia and type iib string theories. in [1], we have provided arguments from the

worldvolume point of view, that there exist bps bound states of dp branes carrying certain

units of quantized constant electric elds, called the (f, dp) bound states, for every p with

1  p  8 in type iia (for p even) and type iib (for p odd) string theory. the space-
time congurations of these bound states have been constructed explicitly for 2  p  7 in
ref.[2]1. each of these bound states preserve one half of the space-time supersymmetries.

in the worldvolume picture the f in (f, dp) represents the uniform and constant electric

eld lines owing along, say, x1 axis of the dp-brane due to the uniform and homogeneous
charge distribution on the rest of the (p  1) plane placed at x1 = , originating from
an innite number of open strings ending on this surface. on the other hand, the space-

time conguration allows us to identify these eld lines with the innitely long fundamental

strings or f-strings in the bulk. to make this identication more concrete, we have calculated

the charges carried by f-strings, dp-branes as well as the mass per unit p-brane volume and

have shown that they match precisely with what we expect from the worldvolume study. we

have noted in [1], that since type iib theory is conjectured to possess an sl(2, z) invariance,

there must exist more general bound states than (f, dp) in this theory. by making use of

this observation, we have constructed the more general non-threshold bound state of the

type ((f, d1), d3) and some of its t-dual descendants in ref.[8].

in this paper, we make an sl(2, z) transformation on the non-threshold bound state

(f, d5) in type iib theory to construct ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state. the space-time

conguration consisting of the metric, the dilaton, the axion and the other non-vanishing

1the congurations for p = 3, 4, 6 were also given previously in [35], respectively. similar non-

threshold bound states in m theory or type iia/iib theory for a p-brane within another p-brane

with p < p were studied in [37].

2

gauge elds for this bound state are constructed explicitly. the initial (f, d5) conguration

consists of an innite number of ns strings (each ns string is actually q f-strings) distributed

uniformly over s d5-branes and lying along one of the spatial directions of d5-brane, where

q and s are relatively prime integers as discussed in [2]. we here consider a genuine initial

(f, d5) bound states, i.e., both q and s are non-zero. in general, we expect that in the

bound state ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)), there are innite number of (m, n) strings lying along one

of the spatial directions of (m, n) 5-branes. although for the degenerate case when either

the strings or the 5-branes (but not both) are present the integers (m, n) and (m, n) are

individually relatively prime, for the general non-degenerate case this is not necessarily so.

for the general ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state, i.e. when the integers m, n and m, n are

non-zero, we nd that a consistent quantization of the charges associated with the nsns

and rr gauge elds of both the strings and the 5-branes relates the charges of the strings

with those of the 5-branes. as a result the integers (m, n) corresponding to the electric

charges of the strings and the integers (m, n) corresponding to the magnetic charges of

the 5-branes get related as (m, n) = k(a, b), (m, n) = k(b, a), where (a, b) and (k, k)
are relatively prime integers. this fact in turn tells us that when both k, k are non-zero

the existence of bound states between m fundamental strings and n d-strings may imply

the existence of bound states between m ns5-branes and n d5-branes, where the integers

(m, n) and (m, n) are related to each other as given before. thus we nd that in general

the sl(2, z) invariant bound state ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) of type iib theory is characterized

by two pairs of relatively prime integers (a, b) and (k, k). we can obtain the other bound

states, namely, (f, d5) and (d1, ns5) from this general solution by setting a = 1, b = 0 and

a = 0, b = 1 respectively. also note that the degenerate (ns5, d5) and (f, d1) cases can be

obtained from the general ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state by setting (i) k = 0, k = 1 and

(ii) k = 0, k = 1. for the former case we get the sl(2, z) 5-branes discussed in [9], whereas

for the latter case we get sl(2, z) strings obtained in [6] with four additional isometries.

but because the charges of the strings and the 5-branes are related as mentioned above, we

cannot have bound states of the form (f, ns5) and (d1, d5) consistent with the fact that

3

these bound states preserve 1/4 rather than 1/2 of the spacetime supersymmetries. we have

also obtained the expression for the tension of sl(2, z) invariant non-threshold bound state

((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) and have shown how it reduces to the tensions for the corresponding

special case bound states.

the descendants of this bound state could be obtained by applying t-duality along

various transverse and longitudinal directions. we give an explicit construction of the bound

states ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) in type iia theory by applying t-duality in one of the transverse

directions. we also discuss how the bound states (f, d6) and (d2, kk) as well as the

degenerate cases (f, d2) and (kk, d6) can be obtained from this general bound state as

special cases. the tension expression for the bound state ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) is also given.

we point out the problem of taking further t-dualities along the transverse directions.

finally, we give a list of possible other descendant bound states which can be obtained from

these by t-dualities in various longitudinal directions as well as s-dualities to those in type

iib theory.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we use the sl(2, z) invariance of type

iib theory to construct the non-threshold ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state starting from

the (f, d5) one. we show that (f, d5), (d1, ns5), (f, d1) and (ns5, d5) bound states

can be obtained from this bound state as special cases. in section 3, we apply t-duality on

((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state along one of the transverse directions to construct ((f,

d2), (kk, d6)) bound state and discuss the special cases as in section 2. since we have

shown how to implement s- and t-dualities in general, we here list all the possible bound

states that can be obtained from the abovementioned bound states by the application of

t-dualities in various longitudinal directions and s-dualities to those belonging to type iib

theory. we conclude this paper in section 4.

ii. sl(2, z) invariance and non-threshold ((f, d1), (ns5, d5))

bound state

in this section, we will use the sl(2, z) symmetry of type iib theory to construct the

non-threshold bound state ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) from the explicit solution (f, d5) given

in [2]. we will follow the procedure outlined in [6], [10], [11]. let us begin with (f, d5)

solution [2] given by the metric,

ds2 = h 1/2 h 1/4 hh 1(cid:16)(dx0)2 + (dx1)2(cid:17) + h 1 (cid:16)(dx2)2 + (dx3)2 + (dx4)2 + (dx5)2(cid:17)

+dyidyii ,

with i = 1, 2, 3, 4; the dilaton,

e = h 1/2,

and the remaining non-vanishing elds,

h (1)
3 = q1/2
20q5
h (2)
3 = s

0

3,

(q,s) dh 1  dx0  dx1,

3
h5 = qs1
(q,s) h 2 dh  dx2  dx3  dx4  dx5.

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

note that in writing this solution we have set the scalars b0 = b0 = 0, as they have

nothing to do with the dilaton and the axion in the theory [2]. also in the above h (1)
3

and

h (2)
3

are the nsns and rr 3-form eld strengths. h5 is the self-dual 5-form eld-strength

with h5 = h5, where  denotes the hodge dual. h is a harmonic function given by

h = 1 +

q5
r2 ,

(2.4)

where r2 = yiyi and q5 = 1/2

0/(23), h  is another harmonic function dened as

(q,s)20q5
q2 + s2h

(q,s)

h  =

= 1 +

s2q5/(q,s)

r2

,

(2.5)

with (q,s) = q2 + s2. here q and s are two relatively prime integers denoting respectively

the quantized ns string charge or the number of f-strings per (2)42 of four dimensional

5

area perpendicular to the strings in (f, d5) and the d5-brane charge as discussed in [2]. n

denotes the volume form on an n-sphere whereas n is the volume of a unit n-sphere and is

given as,

n =

(2)(n+1)/2

( n+1
2 )

.

(2.6)

also, 20 = (2)7/22 and the unit charge for a dp-brane is qp

0  (2)(72p)/2(3p)/2.

the electric charge of the f-strings in (f, d5) bound state can be calculated as,

e(1) =

1

20 zr4s 3 (cid:16)e  h (1)

3 + h (2)

3  b4(cid:17) .

(2.7)

but as mentioned in [2], this expression is in fact innite as there are innite number of

f-strings in (f, d5). however, we can still dene a quantized charge from (2.7) in the form

as given below [2]

q(1) = (2)42

e(1)

20a4

= qtf ,

(2.8)

with tf = 1/(2) the fundamental string tension. here a4 = r dx2dx3dx4dx5 is the
coordinate area of x2x3x4x5-plane. the charge q(1) represents the number of f-strings per

(2)42 area over x2x3x4x5-plane measured in some units (note the f-strings lie along the

x1-axis). also the quantized magnetic charge of the d5-brane is given as,

p (2) = g(2) =

1

20 zs 3

h (2)

3 = sq5
0

(2.9)

it is well-known that type iib supergravity possesses a classical cremmer-julia [12] sym-

metry group sl(2, r). a discrete subgroup sl(2, z) is now believed [13] to survive in the

full quantum type iib string theory. under a global sl(2, r) symmetry the einstein metric

g is a singlet, the two 3-form eld strengths h (1)

3 and h (2)

3

transform as a doublet and the

5-form eld strength is also a singlet. so, the transformations of the various elds alongwith

the two scalars, the dilaton () and the axion (, the rr scalar) parametrizing the coset

sl(2, r)/so(2) dened as m = e

are:

(2.10)

where  is a global sl(2, r) transformation matrix and t  denotes the transpose of a

matrix.

let us next look at how the charges would transform under the global sl(2, r) trans-

formation. since a general sl(2, z) invariant conguration will have both (f, d1) strings

(innite numbers of them) living on (ns5, d5) branes, the charge expression in (2.7) will

be modied to give electric charges of both f-string and d-string as,

e(i) =

1

20 zr4s 3 (cid:16)mij  h (j)

3 + ijh (j)

3  b4(cid:17)

(2.11)

where i, j = 1, 2 and ij is the sl(2, r) invariant totally antisymmetric tensor with 12 = 1.

as before, e(i) is not well-dened and we can dene the quantized charges as,

q(i) =

(2)42e(i)
20a4

the quantized magnetic charges of the ns5-brane and d5-brane can be obtained as,

p (i) = g(i) =

1

20 zs 3

h (i)
3

(2.12)

(2.13)

note that the electric charge in (2.11) or (2.12) is a noether charge and follows from the

equation of motion whereas the magnetic charge is topological and follows from bianchi

identity. it is clear from (2.10) that the electric charges of (f, d1) strings and the magnetic

charges of (ns5, d5) branes would transform as,




q(1)

q(2)




 q  q;




p (1)

 p  (1)tp

(2.14)

now in order to obtain the global sl(2, r) transformation matrix 0, we start with the zero
asymptotic values of the dilaton and the axion i.e. m(initial)
matrix and demand that 0 will transform it into a xed but arbitrary value as

= i, where i is the identity

asymptotic values of the scalars. eq.(2.15) will x the sl(2, r) matrix 0 in terms of 0,

(2.16)

the angle  will be given shortly.

note that once we apply sl(2, r) transformation on the initial quantized charges (2.8)

and (2.9) of (f, d5) by eq.(2.14), the charges will no longer remain quantized. in order to

get around this problem, one either needs to introduce compensating factors in place of both

the charges q and s or replace q and s by arbitrary classical charges as 1/2

(m,n) and 1/2

(m,n)

respectively, where s are the arbitrary numbers and will be determined in the process of

charge quantization [14]. by imposing that the transformed charges are integers2, namely,

(m, n) for strings and (m, n) for the 5-branes we have from (2.14)

eqs.(2.17) and (2.18) determine the form of 1

0 and 5

0 in terms of the asymptotic values of

the dilaton 0 and the axion 0 as follows:

2when we consider either (m, n) strings [15] or (m, n) 5-branes [9], the integers (m, n) or (m, n)

need to be relatively prime in order for the strings or 5-branes to form non-threshold bound states.

for the present non-threshold bound state consisting of an innite number of (m, n) strings and a

(m, n) 5-brane, (m, n) and (m, n) are not necessarily relatively prime as we will see later.

note that in the process of obtaining (2.19) and (2.20), the so(2) angle got xed as,

= h(n + 0m)e0/2  ime0/2i 1/2

(m,n)

(m,n)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

from the above equation we nd that the -factors associated with the strings and the

5-branes are given as,

(m,n) = e0(m  0n)2 + e0n2
(m,n) = e0(n + 0m)2 + e0m2

(2.22)

since the strings and 5-branes are transformed simultaneously by the same sl(2, r) matrix,

so it is clear from eqs.(2.19) and (2.20) that the corresponding charges must be related as,

(m, n) = k(a, b)

(m, n) = k(b, a)

(2.23)

here (a, b) and (k, k) are two pairs of relatively prime integers which can be seen either from

the general tension expression described later in eq.(2.31) or when we consider the special

case bound states. we, therefore, note that for the general ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) conguration

i.e. when none of the integers are zero, (m, n) and (m, n) are not relatively prime in contrast

with the case when we consider either the sl(2, z) strings [6] or the sl(2, z) 5-branes [9].

it can be easily checked that (m,n) = k2 (a,b) and (m,n) = k2 (b,a) = k2 (a,b) are

sl(2, z) invariant. now once we nd the sl(2, r) transformation matrix 0 given either

by eq.(2.19) or by (2.20), we can obtain the general ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) conguration by

9

applying the sl(2, r) transformation given in eq.(2.10) on the initial (f, d5) conguration.

as mentioned earlier, the initial (f, d5) conguration as given in eqs.(2.1)(2.6) should be

modied by the appropriate  factors or more precisely, q should be replaced by 1/2

(m,n) and

s by 1/2

(m,n). keeping this in mind the nal ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) non-threshold bound state

is given by the following metric

ds2 = h 1/2 h 1/4 hh 1(cid:16)(dx0)2 + (dx1)2(cid:17) + h 1 (cid:16)(dx2)2 + (dx3)2 + (dx4)2 + (dx5)2(cid:17)

(2.29)

(2.30)

we note that the metric in (2.24) retains its form after sl(2, r) transformation except

for the introduction of the appropriate -factors as expected. the 5-form eld strength

h5 = h5 in (2.27) is sl(2, r) invariant. also, from (2.25) and (2.26) we nd that as
r  , e  e0 and   0, the corresponding asymptotic values as it should be. let us
now discuss how the (f, d5), (d1, ns5) as well as the degenerate cases (ns5, d5) and (f,

d1) bound states can be obtained from this general conguration as special cases.

from the above solution given by (2.24)(2.30), we can obtain (f, d5) bound state by

setting a = 1 and b = 0. note that the charges associated with the f-stirngs and the d5-

branes are k, k respectively. as shown in [2], (f, d5) will form non-threshold bound states

only when k and k are relatively prime integers. similarly, the other bound state (d1, ns5)

can be obtained by setting a = 0 and b = 1 (also 0 = 0). here the charges associated with

the d-strings and ns5-branes are k and k respectively. however, since string charges are
related to the 5-brane charges as given in eq.(2.23), we can get neither (f, ns5) nor (d1,

d5) bound states and this is consistent with the fact that these congurations break 1/4

of the spacetime supersymmetries as can be inferred from that of the bound state of (d0,

d4) discussed in [16,17]. it should be pointed out that for both k, k non-zero, the existence

of (m, n) string bound states seem to imply the existence of (m, n) 5-brane bound states.

this is nice since the existence of 5-brane bound state is not easy to establish considering

the unrenormalizability of six dimensional sym theory and our poor understanding of the

solitonic 5-branes. however, some interesting scenario for the existence of 5-brane bound

states has been suggested in ref. [18]. the degenerate (ns5, d5) and (f, d1) non-threshold

bound state congurations can also be obtained from ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) conguration

given in eqs. (2.24)  (2.30) by simply setting k = 0, k = 1 and k = 1, k = 0 respectively.

in the former case, we get the sl(2, z) multiplet of 5-branes [9] (ns5, d5) with magnetic

charges (b, a) and in the latter case, we get sl(2, z) strings [6] with electric charges (a, b)
having additional isometries in x2, x3, x4, x5 directions. here (a, b) are arbitrary co-prime

integers as can be shown for the strings [15] and 5-branes [9] to form non-threshold bound

states.

11

the expression for the string-frame tension of the general sl(2, z) bound state ((f, d1),

(ns5, d5)) can be obtained by calculating the mass per unit 5-brane volume. we can do so

by following the steps given in [2] and by generalizing the adm mass formula given in [19].

for a complete string-frame tension, we need to restore the b0 and b0 which are set to

zero from the outset for our above conguration. in particular, we need to set b0 = 0 so

that the string-frame metric approaches minkowski one asymptotically as discussed in [2].

with all these considerations, the complete string-frame tension for this bound state takes

the form:

t5(k, k; a, b) =

t 5
g q[(k  b0 k)2g2 + k2] [(a  0 b)2 + b2g2]
0

(2.31)

where t p

0 = 1/[(2)p(p+1)/2] is the p-brane tension unit and g = e0 is the string coupling

constant. this expression also clearly indicates that both the pairs of integers (k, k) and

(a, b) would have to be relatively prime if the sl(2, z) invariant state ((f, d1), (ns5, d5))

has to form a non-threshold bound state. now it can be easily checked that the above

formula correctly reproduces the tensions of (f, d5) and (d1, ns5) bound states for a = 1,

b = 0 and a = 0, b = 1 respectively (also 0 = 0). similarly, the tensions for (ns5, d5) and

(f, d1)3 can be obtained for k = 0, k = 1 and k = 1, k = 0 respectively (also b0 = 0).

iii. the descendants of ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state

the t-duality rules for various bps solutions along both longitudinal and transverse

directions in type iia/iib theories can be described by the following table (for kk monopole,

the transverse direction is taken to be the nut direction),

3for (f, d1) case we have to multiply the expression by (2)42 of four dimensional area per-

pendicular to the strings since there are innite number of (f, d1) strings in the general bound

state [1],[2].

using the above table, we will give in this section, as a further example, the explicit space-

time conguration of ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) bound state in type iia theory by performing

t-duality on the ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state along one of its transverse directions and

then give the list of other possible bound states towards the end. the general method of

performing t-duality has already been described at length in [2]. we here briey outline

the method for completeness. t-duality along the transverse direction is performed by the

use of the so-called vertical dimensional reduction and the diagonal or double dimensional

oxidation method. let us start with a p-brane (in our case it is the more complicated

((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) brane) solution in type iia (iib) theory. we then use the no-force

condition of the bps states to construct a multi-center solution from the single center one

with an innite periodic array of p-branes placed along the transverse direction. then we

take a continuum limit to obtain the p-brane solution with one isometry along the would-

be compactied direction where the solution is now independent of this coordinate. this

process in turn reduces the dimensionality of the theory to d = 9, known as the vertical

dimensional reduction. once we have this solution, we perform the t-duality transformation

on various elds to write them from iia (iib) basis to iib (iia) basis. then by the so-called

4we do not consider d9 or the space-time lling branes [20].

13

double-dimensional oxidation, we can simply read o the d = 10 (p + 1)-brane solution from

the d = 9 solution. one can also apply t-duality along the longitudinal directions of the

p-brane and obtain new bound states by the method of diagonal reduction and vertical

oxidation, just opposite to the previous case.

((f, d2), (kk, d6)) bound state: here we assume that the (ns5, d5) in the

original ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state is aligned along x1, x2, x3, x4 and x5 direction

and we apply t-duality along x6 direction (assuming (f, d1) to be aligned along the x1-

direction). then following the procedure just outlined [2], we nd that this bound state in

type iia theory is given by the following einstein metric,

ds2 = e0/8h 1/4h 5/8h 1/8 hh 1(cid:16)(dx0)2 + (dx1)2(cid:17) + h 1n(dx2)2 +    + (dx5)2

as discussed in the previous section we can obtain the bound states (f, d6), (d2, kk) as

well as the degenerate cases (f, d2), (kk, d6) from this general bound state as special cases

14

by simply setting a = 1, b = 05; a = 0, b = 1; k = 1, k = 0 and k = 0, k = 1 respectively in

eqs.(3.1)  (3.4). note that for the case of (f, d2) we have additional isometries in x2, x3,

x4 and x5 directions. again as before, we can not get the bound states (f, kk) and (d2,

d6) from the general bound state because of the charge relation eq.(2.23). this is consistent

with the fact that these states preserve 1/4 spacetime supersymmetries. note that in order

for the above metric eq. (3.1) to be free from conical singularity, x6 should have a period of
4kb(20q6

0/2).

a complete string-frame tension formula similar to eq.(2.31) can also be written for the

general bound state ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) in the form:

t6(k, k; a, b) =

t 6
g q[(k  b0 k)2g2 + k2] [(a  0 b)2 + b2g2]
0

(3.5)

with t 6

0 as dened before. this expression reproduces the tensions for the special case bound

states (f, d6), (d2, kk), (f, d2), (kk, d6) by setting a = 1, b = 0; a = 0, b = 1 (also

0 = 0); k = 1, k = 0 and k = 0, k = 1 (also b0 = 0). as in the previous case, in order

to get the correct tension expression for (f, d2) we need to multiply the above expression

by the area (2)42.

at the level of supergravity solution as discussed in [2], we may expect that we can make

a further t-duality on ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) along one of the transverse directions of the

d6 branes6. it is obvious from the metric eq. (3.1) that we have an isometry /. but

t-duality along this direction would result in a complicated metric which depends on the

angle 7. we do not have a clear interpretation for the resulting conguration. we therefore

do not consider this t-duality here. apart from this possible t-duality, it is not obvious to

us if we can have any other simple t-duality as described above along a transverse direction.

5it can be easily checked from (2.26) that when b = 0, the rst term of f2 in eq.(3.3) will not

contribute.

6if we t-dualize along the nut direction, we are back to ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)).

7we would like to thank chris pope for pointing this out to us.

15

now we give the list of all possible descendants of ((f1, d1), (ns5, d5)) and ((f, d2),

(kk, d6)) by applying t-dualities along various longitudinal directions of each of these two

bound states. we will follow the notation of ref.[8]. for example, (ti :7) will denote t-
duality along i-th direction. we assume that the bound state ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) is along

x1, x2, x3, x4 and x5 directions and (f, d1)-strings are along x1-direction. then according

to the table given in the beginning of this section, we can t-dualize each of the above ((f,

dp), (ns5/kk, d(p+4))), with 1  p  2 (for p = 1 we have ns5-state and for p = 2 we
have kk-state), along longitudinal directions of the original (ns5, d5)- branes to obtain

new bound states. but since strings are along x1-directions, we will get dierent bound

states depending on whether we t-dualize 1 direction rst or not. t-dualizing along 1 we

get, for example, the following bound state

((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) (t1 :7) ((w, d0), (ns5, d4)).

(3.6)

we can also apply t-duality along longitudinal directions other than 1 rst and then apply

t-duality along 1. for example, if we t-dualize along 5 rst and then along 1 we get,

((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) (t5 :7) ((f, d2), (ns5, d4)) (t1 :7) ((w, d1), (ns5, d3)).

(3.7)

where the d2 and d4 in ((f, d2), (ns5, d4)) share only one common direction while the d1

and d3 in ((w, d1), (ns5, d3) share no common directions. repeating the above process

to ((f, d2), (ns5, d4) along 4 rst then along 1, we end up with ((f, d3), (ns5, d3))

and ((w, d1), (ns5, d3)). continuing this, we have in general ((w, dp), (ns5, d(4  p))
and ((f, d(p + 1)), (ns5, d(5  p)) for 0  p  4. applying the similar process to ((f,
d2), (kk, d6)), we have in general ((w, d(p + 1)), (kk, d(5  p)) and ((f, d(2 + p)),
(kk, d(6  p)) for 0  p  4.

this exhausts all the possibilities.

in summary, we have the following list of all pos-

sible bound states which can be obtained by t-duality along one transverse and various

longitudinal directions on ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)):

where the second column indicates the number of common directions shared by the

respective d-branes in the bound states. also in the above 0  p  4. if we write the above
bound states in the form ((x, y), (z, v)), then from the properties of ((f, d1), (ns5, d5))

discussed, we can get (x, v) by setting a = 1, b = 0, (y, z) by setting a = 0, b = 1. the

degenerate (z, v) and (x, y) congurations can be obtained by setting k = 0, k = 1 and

k = 1, k = 0 respectively. these degenerate bound states have also been discussed, for

example, in [3,5]. but we can not get the bound states (x, z) and (y, v) because of the

charge relations eq.(2.23).

now some of the states above belong to type iib theory and so, we can apply s-duality

to those states to obtain new bound states. for example, from ((f, d3), (ns5, d3)) we can

have (((f, d1), d3), ((ns5, d5), d3)) as a new bound state. similarly from other states

also we can generate new bound states by s-duality of type iib theory. we can again apply

t-duality on these newly constructed bound states to obtain more bound states, then again

s-duality to those belonging to type iib theory. continuing this process we can obtain

all possible non-threshold bound states by s- and t-dualities simply from the original (f,

d1) strings. this process obviously will end after a nite number of steps and thus we

have nitely many bound states in both type iia and type iib theories8. although at this

stage we are unable to count the exact number of bound states, but since there are nitely

many we believe that they may be related to the number of generators of the largest nite

8even if we count possible bound states by applying t-dualities along the transverse directions

of d6 in ((f, d2), (kk, d6)).

17

u-duality group of type ii theory i.e. e8(+8). we speculate as in [8] that these bound states

would form multiplets of e8(+8) u-duality symmetry in the yet unknown m- or u-theory.

we will come back to provide more evidence for this in the near future.

iv. conclusion

to summarize, by making use of sl(2, z) symmetry of type iib string theory we have

constructed in this paper a more general bound state of the type ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) from

the known (f, d5) conguration. there are innite number of (m, n) strings forming bound

state with (m, n) 5-branes. (m, n) and (m, n) are respectively the integers corresponding

to the charges associated with the nsns and rr gauge elds of the strings and 5-branes.

we have shown that a consistent quantization of charges of the strings and 5-branes relates

these integers as (m, n) = k(a, b) and (m, n) = k(b, a), where (k, k) and (a, b) are two
pairs of relatively prime integers. thus the bound state ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) is characterized

by two pairs of integers (k, k) and (a, b). this seems to indicate that the existence of string

bound states implies the existence of 5-brane bound states. from the explicit space-time

conguration of ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)), we have shown how various bound states appear as

special cases. thus we obtain (f, d5) and (d1, ns5) as well as the degenerate cases (f, d1)

and (ns5, d5) bound states from here, but because of the charge relation between strings

and 5-branes we can not get (f, ns5) and (d1, d5) bound states. this result is consistent

with the fact that (f, ns5) and (d1, d5) preserve 1/4 rather than half of the spacetime

supersymmetries. we have also given the tension expression for the general ((f, d1), (ns5,

d5)) non-threshold bound state which reduces to the correct expressions for the tensions of

the individual special case bound states by the proper choice of the integers (k, k; a, b).

the descendants of this bound state could be obtained by applying t-dualities along

various transverse and longitudinal directions as well as s-duality of type iib theory. we

have given explicit space-time conguration of ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) in type iia theory by

applying t-duality in one of the transverse dierctions on ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)). how the

18

various bound states can be obtained as special cases are also indicated. as in the previous

case, we have given a similar tension expression for this bound state. then we have given the

list of all possible bound states which can be obtained from ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) and ((f,

d2), (kk, d6)) by t-dualities. as we have mentioned, this is not the end of the story. we

can form new bound states by applying s-duality to these t-dual bound states belonging

to type iib theory. t-duality can again be applied to these new set of bound states to

generate another new set. then s-duality on those in type iib theory will produce even

more bound states. thus continuing this process we can generate all possible bound states,

which will be nitely many, in both type iia and type iib theories. all these states preserve

one half of the space time supersymmetries. we conjecture that these bound states would

form multiplets of the largest nite u-duality group e8(+8) of yet unknown m- or u-theory.
