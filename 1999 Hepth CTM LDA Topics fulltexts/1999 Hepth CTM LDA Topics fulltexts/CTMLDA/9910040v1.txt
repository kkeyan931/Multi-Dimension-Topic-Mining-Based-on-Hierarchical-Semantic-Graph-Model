we use the counterterm subtraction method to calculate
the action, stressenergymomentum tensor for the (kerr)
rotating black holes in adsn+1, for n=2,3 and 4. we demon-
strate that the expressions for the total energy for the kerr
ads3 and kerrads5 spacetimes, in the limit of vanishing
black hole mass, are equal to the casimir energies of the holo-
graphically dual ndimensional conformal eld theories.
in
particular, for kerrads5, dual to the case of four dimen-
sional n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory on the rotat-
ing einstein universe, we explicitly verify the equality of the
t =0 stress tensor from the two sides of the correspondence,
and present the result for general t as a prediction from grav-
ity. amusingly, in this case it is observed that while the trace
of the stress tensor does not vanish, its integral does, thereby
keeping the action free of ultraviolet divergences.

i. introduction

the ads/cft correspondence relates an (n+1)
dimensional theory of gravity on antide sitter (ads)
spacetime (times a compact manifold) to a conformal
eld theory (cft) in n dimensions. this duality rst
arose as a result of investigating [1] n parallel d3
branes in the context of the low energy, (i.e., the limit
of zero , the inverse string tension) classical (weak
string coupling, gs) limit of type iib superstring theory
on ads5s5. a precise statement of the ads/cft cor-
respondence [2,3] is the equality of the partition functions
of the two theories,

the rst term is the einsteinhilbert action with nega-
tive cosmological constant (=n(n1)/2l2). the sec-
ond term is the gibbonshawking boundary term. here,
hab is the boundary metric and k is the trace of the
extrinsic curvature k ab of the boundary.

to deal with the divergences which appear in the grav-
itational action (arising from integrating over the in-
nite volume of spacetime), two dierent techniques may
be employed. the traditional background subtraction
technique [4,5] (which subtracts the contribution from a
reference spacetime to get a nite result) and the coun-
terterm subtraction method [6] (which regulates the ac-
tion by the addition of certain boundary counterterms).
as the counterterms depend upon the geometrical prop-
erties of the boundary of the spacetime, the countert-
erm subtraction method provides an intrinsic denition
of the action for a particular spacetime. this sidesteps
problems which arise in using the other method when
the spacetime in question has an ambiguous (or simply
unknown) choice of background.

the divergences of the einsteinhilbert action (in di-
mensions less than six) can be canceled by adding the
following counterterms1,

ict =

1

8gzm

dnxh(cid:20) (n  1)

l



lr

2(n  1)(cid:21) .

(3)

here r is the ricci scalar for the boundary metric h.
using these counterterms one can construct a divergence
free stress tensor which is given by (i=ibulk+isurf +ict):

zads(i) = zcf t (0,i) .

(1)

t ab =

from the gravityonads point of view, i is a bulk eld
constrained to the values 0,i on the boundary, while
from the cft point of view, 0,i are sources for pointlike
operators, oi, in the theory. in the low energy limit of
the theory one can use the classical gravitational action
to calculate the partition function of the cft on the
boundary. this action has the form [4],

1in ref. [7], the counterterm subtraction method was stud-
ied extensively, with many examples, and a new counterterm
was presented there which allows the subtraction regulariza-
tion to be performed in dimensions n+1=6, 7. see also refs.
[814] for related studies, some more applications and further
extensions.

where gab is the einstein tensor in n dimensions. (cor-
respondingly, the last term should be omitted for n=2.)
the above prescription gives a denition of the action
and stresstensor on any region (say, of radius r) bound-
ing the interior of ads. the ads/cft holographic re-
lation (in the form which we will need it here) equates
these quantities to a dual conformal eld theory residing
on the boundary at innity2 (r in the coordinates we
will choose later). recalling that the metric restricted to
the boundary, hab, diverges due to an innite conformal
factor r2/l2, we dene the background metric upon which
the dual eld theory resides as

ab = lim
r

l2
r2 hab .

(5)

consequently, the eld theorys stresstensor, bt ab, is re-

lated to the one above (4) by the rescaling [15]:

 abbt bc = lim

r

h habt bc ,

which amounts to multiplying all expressions for t ab dis-
played later by (r/l)n2 before taking the limit r.

ii. kerrads3

as a warmup and review, we will study the case of
kerrads3. the explicit computation of the energy
momentum tensor and the mass, angular momentum and
casimir energy using the counterterm subtraction tech-
nique has been done in ref. [6]. here, we will perform all
of those computations in a dierent choice of coordinates,
supplementing the discussion and calculations where nec-
essary. this will serve the twin purposes of setting up the
notation of the rest of the paper, and illustrating the sim-
ilarities to (and dierences from) the higher dimensional
cases which we later present.

we use the form of kerrads3 metric in ref. [17] which
resembles the higher dimensional kerrads metrics and
can be obtained from the btz black hole by coordinate
transformation [18,19]:

where

r = (r2 + a2)(cid:18)1 +
 =(cid:18)1 
l2(cid:19) .

here, a is the rotational parameter. the horizons are the
zeros of r, and r+ is the outer horizon which is [19]:

if we were to take ti , dening the euclidean sec-
tion (putting the theory at nite temperature), regularity
(thermal equilibrium) requires that the euclidean time
period (inverse temperature)  has the form:

2the theory on the boundary at radius r can be taken to be
a dual eld theory with an ultraviolet cuto proportional to r.
then r denes the uv xed point conformal eld theory.
this also ts with the fact that the counterterms, while reg-
ulating an infrared (ir) divergence coming from the bulk,
have the dual interpretation as regulating uv divergences in
the eld theory [16,6].

it is interesting to note that the resulting eld the-
ory stress tensor (obtained using eqn.(6) and discussion
below) can be written in the following form3:

be written in this form.

a. comparison to field theory

16gl

where ua=(1, 0) is a unit timelike four vector and
va=(1, 1/la/l2) is a null vector, i.e., vbvb=0. the ten-
sor is therefore manifestly traceless. the coecients are:
a = (cid:0)2m g  (1 + a/l)2(cid:1)

a(1 + a/l)2

; b =

.

(18)

it is straightforward to check that this tensor is covari-
antly conserved. notice that when a=0, b vanishes and
a=(2m g1)/(16gl), giving a standard form for the
stressenergymomentum tensor of a uid of massless

particles with some energy density given by bt00. notice

that a, in front of the part of the stress tensor in standard
form contains the black hole parameter m the thermal
part of the eld theory while b, the coecient of the
null vector part, refers only to rotational parameters. we
will nd that this form will persist to higher dimensions.
to calculate the conserved quantities for these space-
times, we use the following denition for a conserved
charge [20], associated to a symmetry generated by the
killing vector :

q =z

dn1xut .

(19)

where u= n t,, while n and  are the lapse function
and the spacelike metric which appear in the admlike
decomposition of the boundary metric

ds2 = n 2dt2 + ab(dxa + n adt)(dxb + n bdt) .
our convention for the killing vectors  is as follows:
t is the killing vector conjugate to the time t and  is
the killing vector conjugate to . using the above deni-
tion for the conserved charge, the mass and the angular
momentum of the kerrads3 spacetime are given by

tion

the action with the other quantities satisfy the rst law
of thermodynamics

(23)

for n=2, which is a nontrivial check of some of our com-
putations. we will perform this check in the more com-
plicated examples to come.

our dual eld theory resides on the spacetime with

metric  giving line element

ds2 = dt2 +

2a


dtd +

l2


d2 .

(24)

notice that this can be brought into the form of a metric
on a cylinder (rs1)

ds2 = dt 2 + r2 d2 ,

(25)
with r=l/, using the following coordinate transfor-
mation [17]:

t =

t


,  =  + at/l2 .

(26)

now,  is identied with +, where = is the
period of .
our traceless result above (eqn.s (16) and (17)) there-
fore correctly reproduces the result for the trace anomaly,
given in two dimensions by

a = 

cr
24

,

(27)

bt a

where c is the central charge and r is the intrinsic cur-
vature of spacetime, which is zero for the cylinder.
according to the correspondence, the casimir energy
of the dual eld theory4 is the contribution to the mass
of spacetime m which is independent of the black hole
parameter5, m , and is given by

e = 

1
8g

.

(28)

given the standard result [24] for the relationship be-
tween the central charge of the conformal eld theory
and gravity in ads3, c=3l/2g, we see that this trans-
lates into a vacuum energy c/(12l) for the theory on the
cylinder. this is consistent with the interpretation [25]
of the spacetime (7), with m =0, as the neveu-schwarz
neveu-schwarz vacuum of the holographically dual super
conformal eld theory: the fermions have antiperiodic
boundary conditions as they go once around the cylin-
der, preventing their zeropoint energy from cancelling
that of the bosons, as happens in the ramondramond
sector.

4in higher dimensions, connections between energy of a
spacetime solution and casimir energy of a dual eld theory
were rst pointed out in ref. [23].
5in the literature, this contribution is often called the mass
of the zeromass btz black hole.

converting with the conformal factor and taking the
limit (see (6)), we nd that the stress tensor of the eld
theory has this simple form:

m

8l2(cid:2)3uaub + ab(cid:3)

bt ab =

(40)

where ua = (1, 0, 0). this is the standard form for the
stress tensor of the nonrotating theory 2+1 dimensional
conformal eld theory! the tensor is covariantly con-
served and manifestly traceless, the latter result being
consistent with the absence of a conformal anomaly in
odd dimensional spacetime. it is interesting to note that
the tensor can be written in such a simple form for this
theory, even in the presence of rotation, in contrast to
the case in two dimensions (see eqn.(17)), and as we will
see, the four dimensional case.

the action calculation in this case gives the result:

i4 = 

g(3r4

+ + a2)(r2

(r2
+/l2 + r2

+ + a2r2

+/l2  1)

+/l2  a2)

,

(41)

which agrees with action calculation using the back-
ground subtraction technique in ref.
[17], since the
casimir energy is zero for an odd dimensional eld the-
ory. also it agrees with the action for kerrnewmann
[13] in the limit where the charges vanish. these quanti-
ties also satisfy the rst law (i.e., eqn.(23) with n=3.)

the location of the horizon, the largest root of r.

the area of the horizon is

(32)

the nonvanishing components of the kerrads4
stress tensor for large r exactly match the components re-
cently computed for the kerrnewmanads4 case in ref.
[13] in the limit where the charges vanish (i.e., their z0)
and are

now we have

(38)

removing the conformal factor (see (5)), our dual eld
theory is dened on the spacetime (with coordinates
(t, , )) with metric ab:

with the angular velocity given again by eqn. (12). again,
r+ is the location of the horizon, the largest root of r.

in ref. [17] the calculation for the relevant physical
quantities was carried out using the subtraction tech-
nique. the reference spacetime in those calculations
was the spacetime with m =0, i.e., ads5 in very non
standard coordinates. here, we go some steps further,
by computing and studying physics intrinsic to the kerr
ads5 spacetime with no reference to a background, al-
lowing us to extract physical quantities like the casimir
energy and other interesting features of the stress tensor,
as we shall see.

after computation, we get the following nonvanishing

components for the stress tensor at large r,

using the above denition (19) for a conserved charge,
one can calculate the mass and angular momentum of
the solution, with the result:

a. comparison to field theory

the metric on the boundary is that of a rotating ein-

stein universe:

ds2 =

dtd + l2 d2


2a sin2 


+l2 sin2 


d2 + l2 cos2 d2(cid:21) .

(49)

removing the factor r2/l2 (dening the metric ab)
gives the line element of the spacetime (with coordinates
(t, , , )) upon which our conformal eld theory resides,
and for which we must compute the energymomentum
tensor in order to compare to the gravity computation.
this seems at rst a daunting prospect, until one notices
by direct computation that the weyl tensor vanishes for
this spacetime, showing that it is conformally at. this
indeed follows from the fact [17] that the spacetime (42),
with m = 0, is actually just ads5 in nonstandard coor-
dinates, and so its boundary shares some of the conformal
properties of the boudary of ads5.

one can therefore use the following general expression
from ref. [26] to calculate the stress tensor of a eld theory
dened on conformally at spacetime in four dimensions:

where h b
, s and s are dened in ref. [26]
a
(there, they use spacetime indices (, ) for the eld the-
ory while here we use (a, b)). the label s{0, 1/2, 1} dis-
tinguishes the spin of the eld for which the labelled co-
ecients s and s are computed. we can now compare
this to the the nonthermal (i.e., the m independent)
part of the tensor which we have computed on the grav-
ity side.

according to the ads/cft holographic relation, one
should dene the casimir energy for the eld theory dual
to the kerrads spacetime as the contribution to the
total energy of the spacetime (46) which is independent
of the black holes mass. this is given by

the area of the horizon is

.

in the limit a0 this reduces to the casimir energy of
the nonrotating black hole discussed in ref. [6].
now we would like to show that the expression in
eqn. (51) exactly matches the energy of the n =4 super-
symmetric u (n ) yangmills theory dened on a rotat-
ing einstein universe, which is the cft on the boundary.
the relation between the parameters of the gravity the-
ory in the bulk and those of the cft on the boundary
is [1]

(47)

the above quantities satisfy the rst law (i.e., eqn.(23)
with n=4).

boundary metric ab, we nd that this is precisely the
result obtained in eqn.(57).

we nd that the stresstensor for the cft on the ro-
tating static einstein universe may be written in the fol-
lowing form:

using this relation in eqn. (51) one gets

n 2

e =

(a4/l4 + 9) .

(53)

since the the gravitational quasilocal stress tensor and
the stress tensor of the cft on the boundary are dual
to one another, one can use the following expression for
the energy of the eld theory,

e = xs=0, 1

where ns is the number of particles with spin s in the

spin half particle is the weyl fermion. substituting in the
values for (ns, s, s), we nd that the resulting energy
of the cft exactly matches the prediction (53) for the
casimir energy from gravity.

using the relation eqn. (52) between the gravitational
parameters and the gauge theory parameters and taking
the large r limit, one gets a prediction for the eld theory
quantity:

this precisely matches what one obtains by performing
directly the trace of the stresstensor dened for the eld
theory in eqn.(50).

as a nal check, we note that the general form of the
conformal anomaly in four dimensions (adapted to the
present case [22,6]) is given by

notice again, just as we saw in lower dimensions, that the
coecient, a, of the part of the tensor in standard form
is the only one which depends upon the thermal part of
the theory represented by the black hole mass while
the other coecients, referring to the null vectors, are
independent of m .
it is also interesting to note that
when a0, while c and d vanish, the terms involving
b and e cancel each other.
the last term in the energymomentum tensor (59)
emphasizes the conformal anomalys presence. that
there is a conformal anomaly is interesting. general con-
siderations (see e.g., ref. [22]) show that in the presence
of a conformal anomaly, the action has a divergent piece

idiv  log(r/l)z d4x bt a

a .

(62)

(see ref. [7] for specic examples in this context.) from
reading ref. [28], however, one expects that the corre-
sponding logarithmic (uv) divergence (log(r/l)) of the
action should not be present for a spacetime which can

be written locally as a product. in support of this, the
action (47) which we computed does not have a logarithm
(in contrast to the examples in ref. [7]), as we have seen,
presenting us with a paradox. this is resolved upon re-
alization that the integrated trace actually does vanish,
as a computation reveals6.
it would be interesting to
characterize this example further, and nd others of this
type.

we see that the gravity computation (which is dual to
a computation in strongly coupled eld theory) matches
the results from the weakly coupled eld theory compu-
tation. in the case of pure ads5, the reason for the pre-
cise match, as explained in ref. [6], is that pure ads5
receives no stringy corrections because all tensors (in
terms of which the stringy corrections can be written)
that can modify einsteins eld equations vanish for that
space. this translates into no dierence between the re-
sults for strong and weak coupling eld theory, because
the stringy corrections are correlated with corrections in
eld theory coupling, as required by the duality [1].

that this is also true for the kerrads5 case, in the
limit of zero black hole mass where we have shown
full agreement with eld theory follows simply because
m =0 kerrads5 is just ads5 in nonstandard coordi-
nates [17], parameterised by a. it therefore shares many
of the conformal properties with ads5. as the stringy
corrections can all be written in terms of the weyl ten-
sor of the spacetime, if they vanish for ads5, they vanish
here also.

v. concluding remarks

the counterterm subtraction technique has allowed for
the intrinsic denition of the action (and the quanti-
ties which follow) for the kerradsn+1 spacetimes, for
n=2, 3, 4. this is in contrast to the background subtrac-
tion technique, which required a reference spacetime in
order to compute a nite action. in subtracting the con-
tribution from a reference spacetime to get a nite action,
any physics common to both spacetimes is lost. in this
paper we have computed examples of such quantities, the
casimir energies and conformal anomaly for eld theories
residing on even dimensional spacetimes.

we have shown that the quantities thus computed (and
indeed, the full stressenergymomentum tensor in four
dimensions) are consistent with a holographic interpre-
tation of the physics of gravity in ads in terms of dual
conformal eld theory. the casimir energies which we
computed for the holographically dual two and four di-
mensional conformal eld theories (residing on a rotat-
ing cylinder, or the rotating einstein universe) exactly

6we are grateful to r. c. myers for a crucial discussion, and

for pointing out the vanishing.

matched the contribution to the energy computed for
the kerrads spacetime which is not attributable to the
black hole. also, the nonzero conformal anomaly in
the four dimensional case exactly matched the result for
kerrads5.
in all cases (n=2, 3, 4) we found that the
stress tensor for the eld theory on the rotating space-
time can be neatly written in terms of a sum of a standard
traceless thermal form (involving the mass of the dual
black hole) and additional terms involving null vectors.
intriguingly, for n=3, there are no such additional terms;
its stress tensor keeps the simple thermal form. this may
be an important feature of the m2brane worldvolume
conformal eld theory [29,30]. while the computation
for the two dimensional conformal eld theory and the
related ads3 spacetime is essentially contained in ref.
[6], the results for higher dimensions are new.

we expect that these results also follow for kerr
adsn+1, for n+1>5. it would be especially interesting
to see the form of the tensor for kerrads7, including its
trace. however, we found that the computational com-
plexities encountered due to the odiagonal terms in the
metric and the additional counterterms needed [7]
were too severe to allow for an exploration using the tech-
niques which we have employed so far.
