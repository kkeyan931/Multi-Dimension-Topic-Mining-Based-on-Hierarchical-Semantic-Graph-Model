abstract

the canonical structure of pure yang-mills theory is analysed in the case when gauss law
is satised identically by construction. it is shown that the theory has a canonical structure
in this case, provided one uses a special gauge condition, which is a natural generalisation
of the coulomb gauge condition of electrodynamics. the emergence of a canonical structure
depends critically also on the boundary conditions used for the relevant eld variables. possible
boundary conditions are analysed in detail. a comparison of the present formulation in the
generalised coulomb gauge with the well known weyl gauge (a0 = 0) formulation is made. it
appears that the hamiltonians in these two formulations dier from one another in a non-trivial
way. it is still an open question whether these dierences give rise to truly dierent structures
upon quantisation. an extension of the formalism to include coupling to fermionic elds is
briey discussed.

1 introduction

this paper is concerned with analysing the canonical structure of pure yang-mills theory [1]
along the lines of two previous publications [2], [3], in which a new gauge condition, called
the generalized coulomb gauge condition was introduced and used to obtain a straightforward
canonical formulation of yang-mills theory, in the case when gauss law is satised identically
by construction. in the previous papers certain assumptions were made concerning the spa-
tial boundary conditions of the yang-mills potentials. the boundary conditions in question
are very important for the elucidation of the canonical structure. here i will analyse the req-
uisite boundary conditions in detail, and show that there is a set of boundary conditions at
spatial innity, which is consistent with the canonical structure. rigorous proofs and heavy
mathematical machinery are omitted here in the interest of simplicity.

the basic quantity of yang-mills theory is the action s, which is given in terms of the gauge

eld g as follows,

s = 

1

4 z d4x(g(a), g(a)).

(1)

where the inner product ( , ) is dened below. for the gauge eld g i use a matrix notation
(summation over repeated indices),

g(a)  g a

 (a)ta =  a(x)  a(x)  ig[a(x), a(x)],

(2)

where the quantities ta are matrices in a convenient representation of the lie algebra of the
gauge group g,

and the quantities a are the gauge potential components,

[ta, tb] = if c

ab tc,

a(x) = a a

 ta.

(3)

(4)

it is assumed that the gauge group g is semisimple and compact. the inner product ( , )
for any two lie algebra valued (matrix valued) quantities a = aata and b = bata is then
expressed with the aid of the lie algebra structure constants f c

ab as follows,

where

(a, b) = habaabb,

hab = f c

ab f b
bc .

(5)

(6)

the quantity hab and its inverse hab are used to lower and rise lie algebra indices, respectively.
the notation used here is otherwise pretty standard or self-explanatory, with e.g. greek letters
used as indices denoting minkowski space indices ranging from 0 to 3, and latin indices from
the middle of the alphabet (k, , ...) denoting space indices ranging from 1 to 3. the minkowski
space metric is taken to be diagonal, with signature (+, , , ). unless otherwise stated,
repeated indices are always summed over, be they lie algebra-, spacetime- or space indices.

1

it is convenient for future reference to write the action (1) in terms of a lagrangian l. the

action s is the integral of the lagrangian l in an appropriate time interval [x0

i , x0

f ]. thus,

f

s = z x0

x0
i

dx0l,

where

l =

d3x(cid:16)g0k(a), g0k(a)(cid:17) 

1

4 zv

d3x(cid:16)gk(a), gk(a)(cid:17) .

in the expression (8) for the lagrangian l, the quantity v is some appropriate domain in r3,
which yet has to be specied.

as is well known, requiring the action (1) to be stationary with respect to local variations
of all the potential components a, considered as independent quantities, yields the follwing
eld equations,

the covariant gradient (a) used above in eq. (9) is a convenient notion,

(a)g(a) = 0 ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

which will be frequently used in what follows.

(a)   + ig [a,

],

(9)

(10)

the non-abelian gauss law is obtained from the equations (9) for  = 0. expressed in

terms of the potential a the non-abelian gauss law reads as follows,

where

k(a)k(a)a0  k(a) ak = 0,

ak(x)  0ak(x).

(11)

(12)

the time derivative of any quantity will frequently in what follows be denoted by a dot on

top of that quantity, as in the equation (12) above.

1.1 the hamiltonian or weyl gauge formalism

it is well known [4] that yang-mills theory can be expressed in a canonical form in the hamil-
tonian gauge, or so-called weyl gauge [5] a0 = 0.

the yang-mills lagrangian in the case a0 = 0, which will be called lw here, is obtained

from the expression (8) by putting a0 = 0 in that expression,

lw = 

1

2 z d3x( ak, ak) 

1

4 z d3x(gk, gk).

(13)

the lagrangian (13) describes a theory which is not quite the same as yang-mills theory,
since gauss law is absent from the eld equations following from the action principle with the

2

expression (13) as lagrangian. gauss law takes the following form in the case when a0 = 0,
as seen from eq. (11) above,

k(a) ak = 0.

(14)

the usual way to analyse yang-mills theory in the weyl gauge a0 = 0, is to proceed from
the lagrangian (13), disregarding gauss law to begin with. using the variables aa
k as
generalised coordinates and velocities, respectively, it is then perfectly simple to derive a canon-
ical hamiltonian formalism for the system dened by the lagrangian (13). the corresponding
hamiltonian hw is,

k and aa

hw = 

1

2 z d3x(k, k) +

1

4 z d3x(gk, gk),

(15)

i.e. a simple sum of a kinetic term, depending on canonical momenta k
or interaction term, depending on conjugate canonical coordinates aa

k only.

a only, and a potential,

2 first attempt at a canonical formulation when gauss

law is in force

gauss law, eq. (11) above, will now be considered as an equation determining the (matrix
valued) potential component a0, for given space components a and a. this equation is a
system of linear, elliptic partial dierential equations with time x0 acting as a parameter in an
appropriate interval, with x  v being the independet variables. i will discuss the solvability
of eq. (11) subsequently, but proceed now by assuming the existence of unique solution a0,
which is a functional of the space components a and their time derivatives 0a  a, i.e.

a0 = a0na, ao .

(16)

the question is then whether the yang-mills system, which is originally dened by the
action (1), permits a canonical structure when the potential component a0 is a solution to
gauss law (11), i.e. when a0 is given in terms of a and a by the expression (16).
it is
possible to get some insight into this question without specifying the actual functional form of
the relation (16) in minute detail.

the lagrangian of the yang-mills system, when the potential component a0, is given by the
relation (16) above, is obtained simply by inserting the solution (16) for a0 into the lagrangian
(8) above. the resulting lagrangian will be called l0, and is explicitly given as follows,

l0 =

d3x(cid:16)gkl(a), gkl(a)(cid:17) .

(17)

at this point it is appropriate to check whether the action principle involving the lagrangian
l0 in (17) above reproduces the eld equations (9). it is perfectly straightforward to verify the

3

following result,

d2k(cid:16)a0na, ao , k(a)a0na, ao  ak(cid:17) .

now the boundary conditions for the solution a0 to gauss law, i.e. the system of linear
elliptic partial dierential equations (11), enter into the discussion.
if the surface term in
eq. (18) is non-vanishing, and not by itself a variation of some surface functional, then the
lagrangian (17) is not a valid lagrangian in the action principle which is supposed to lead to
the eld equations (9) for  = 1, 2, 3, when a0 is given by (16).

in the rst place the domain v is actually considered to be all of r3. the integrals over v

will be given the following interpretation,

zv

d3x   = lim

rz|x|<r

d3x   

the vanishing of the surface term in eq. (18) is then equivalent to the follwing,

lim

rz|x|=r

dr2(cid:16)a0[a, a], (r)(a)a0na, ao  a(r)(cid:17) = 0,

where the superscript (r) denotes the radial component of the corresponding quantity.

(19)

(20)

thus, if

the surface term (20) vanishes for all admissible variations of the independent

generalised coordinates a and velocities a, respectively, then the variational principle

leads to the following equations of motion,

f

 z x0

x0
i

dx0l0 = 0,

0(a)(k(a)a0na, ao  ak)  gk(a) = 0,

(21)

(22)

as is evident from the relation (18). needless to say, the equations (22) are nothing but the
eld equations (9) for  = 1, 2, 3, with a0 given by the formal solution (16) to gauss law (11).
the vanishing of the surface term (20) depends on the assumed asymptotic behaviour of the
independent variables a and a, as well as on the boundary conditions (at spatial innity) of
the dependent variable a0. i will return to this question below, and continue for the time being
by assuming that the relation (20) is valid. then the lagrangian l0 given in (17) ought to be
a suitable starting point for the construction of a hamiltonian and the corresponding canonical
variables by means of a legendre transform in the usual way.

the formal denition of the canonical momentum p a

a is,

k (x0, x) 
p a

l0

 ak

= (cid:16)k(a)a0na, ao(cid:17)a

(x0, x)  aa

k(x0, x),

(23)

4

where the condition (20) has been used in the calculation of the functional derivative of l0
in (23) above.
in view of the fact that a0 in eq. (23) satises gauss law (11), one nds
immediately from (23) that

k(a)pk(x0, x)  0.

(24)

now one is supposed to be able to solve eq. (23) for the generalised velocity aa
k in terms of a
and p, respectively. but this is impossible, since, eq. (23) can not be solved for the quantity
 dened below,

(x0, x)  k(a) ak(x0, x),

(25)

i.e. if one tries to derive an equation for the quantity  dened above from eq. (23), one gets
a completely vacuous identity for this quantity, as a result of eq. (24).

it would seem then, that the canonical formalism breaks down for the case at hand. however
this is not necessarily the case. the diculty described above can be avoided if one can manage
to make a0 independent of the generalized velocity variables a. this can be accomplished in
the present situation (a0 6= 0) by imposing the following gauge condition,

k(a) ak(x0, x) = 0.

(26)

the condition (26) is the generalized coulomb gauge condition referred to previously. the fact
that this is actually a proper gauge condition, has been demonstrated in ref. [2].

however, if one uses the gauge condition (26) then the generalised velocities

ak are no
longer independent quantities, and then one cannot use the formula (23) as it stands for the
construction of the canonical momentum variables. an alternative procedure which leads to a
proper canonical formalism will be given below.

3 gauss law and asymptotic conditions

i now assume that the generalized coulomb gauge condition (26 is in force. then gauss law,
eq. (11), takes the following form,

k(a)k(a)a0 = 0.

(27)

if one demands that the solution to eq. (27) vanishes roughlty speaking faster than | x | 1
2 for
| x | , then the solution vanishes identically. this can be seen as follows. take the inner
product of eq. (27) with a0 and integrate over x. using the ordinary divergence theorem one
readily obtains the following result,

lim

r z|x|<r

d3x(k(a)a0, k(a)a0) = lim

r z|x|=r

dr2(a0, (r)(a)a0).

(28)

assuming now

a0(x0, x) ||x|=r  r , (r)(a)a0(x0, x) ||x|=r  r1 ,  >

1
2

,

(29)

5

one nds that the limiting value of the right hand side of eq. (28) is zero. since the inner
product ( , ) is positive denite, one then concludes from eq.
(28) that a0 is covariantly
constant. however, since a0 vanishes at innity by assumption, the covariant constant is zero,
i.e. that

a0(x0, x)  0.

(30)

needless to say, the asymptotic condition (29) above can be somewhat rened; all that is needed
to obtain the result (30) is that the right hand side of eq. (28) vanishes, which guarantees that
a0 is covariantly constant, and then that a0 has the limiting value 0 at innity (or at some
nite point), so that the covariant constant in question actually vanishes.

however, the class of functions with (roughly speaking) the asymptotic behaviour (29) does
not exhaust the class of possible solutions to eq. (27). it is also possible to consider functions
a0 which approach a non-vanishing constant matrix at space innity,

lim
|x|

a0(x0, x) =   ata,

(31)

where the real quantities a are absolute constants. in addition to eq. (31) one can impose an
asymptotic condition on the radial derivative of a0,

lim
|x|

| x |



 | x |

a0(x0, x) = 0.

(32)

requiring the validity of the asymptotic conditions (31) and (32) and using standard arguments
of potential theory [6], one now derives an integral representation for the function a0 involving
the (ordinary) laplacian of that function,

a0(x0, x) =  

1

4 zr3

d3y

1

| x  y |

2

ya0(x0, y),

(33)

using the the present form of gauss law, eq. (27), one then converts (33) into an integral
equation for the determination of a0. for this purpose it is convenient to introduce some new
notation,

u ka

b(x0, y) := 2gf a

bcakc(x0, y),

and

v a

b(x0, y) := 2gf a

bc


yk

akc(x0, y) + g2f a

cdf c

baa d

k (x0, y)aka

(x0, y).

one then obtains the following integral equations,

0(x0, x) = a

| x  y | (u ka

0(x0, y)) .

(36)

the integral equations (36) constitute the starting point for the proof of existence of solutions to
the present form of gauss law, eq. (27). for this one needs naturally also to specify conditions
on the potential components aa
k, which, together with their space derivatives determine the
(unique) solution to eq. (36). all this is a part of the heavy mechinery mentioned in the

6

introduction, which i will omit in this paper. however it is appropriate to note the following
asymptotic conditions, which are needed for the existence of solutions aa

0 to eq. (36),

aa

k(x0, x) 

1

| x |1+

,


x

aa

k(x0, x) 

1

,  > 0.

(37)

i will now denote the solution of the system of integral equations (36) by a0 {a}, and the

corresponding lagrangian by l00 (compare with eq. (17)) ,

l00 =

d3x(cid:16)gkl(a), gkl(a)(cid:17) .

(38)

the lagrangian (38) will now in the next section be used to derive the hamiltonian for the
yang-mills system under the condition that the generalized coulomb gauge (26) is in force. i
implement this condition as a constraint, by means of a (matrix valued) lagrange multiplier
eld c(x), which is used to modify the lagrangian (38) as follows,

l00  l = l00 +zv

d3x(c(x), k(a) ak).

(39)

4 canonical coordinates, momenta and hamiltonian

i now make a direct transition to a hamiltonian formulation using the modied lagrangian
(39) above, in a manner described in the general case by berezin [7]. the starting point is the
familiar denition of canonical momentum variables a
k,

k(x0, x) 
a

l
a(x0, x)

 ak

= (k(a)a0 {a})a  aa

k  (k(a)c)a ,

(40)

the equations (40) above, together with the constraint equations (26) are now supposed to be
solved for the quantities aa
a and momenta a
k,
respectively. using eqns. (26) and (27), one nds immediately from eq. (40) that

k and c a in terms of the canonical coordinates ak

 k(a)k(a)c = k(a)k,

(41)

which, together with appropriate boundary conditions, denes the quantity c as an x-dependent
functional of a and , respectively,

c = c {a, } (x0, x).

(42)

it is certainly desirable that the solution c {a, } to eq. (41) be unique. the uniqueness is
guaranteed if one uses the following boundary condition,

lim

r z|x|=r

dr2(c(x), (r)(a)c(x)) = 0.

(43)

7

the proof of uniqueness of the solution to eq. (41) under the condition (43) has essentially
already been given above in connection with eq. (27). namely, if there are two distinct solutions
to eq. (41), then their dierence satises the corresponding homogeneous equation, which is
precisely of the form (27). however, under the condition (43), the homogeneous equation in
question has only the trivial zero solution, as demonstrated in the discussion following eq. (27).
hence the solution c {a, } is unique.

one now straightforwardly expresses the generalised velocity in terms of coordinate- and

momentum variables,

aa

k = (k(a0 {a}  c))a  a
k .

(44)

the construction of the hamiltonian h then proceeds in the usual way. the relation dening
the hamiltonian h is the following,

h = zv

d3x(k, ak)  l00,

(45)

where the quantity ak ocurring in the expressions in (45) should be given in terms of canonical
variables by the expression (44). it should be observed, that it is indeed the lagrangian l00
which enters in the denition of the hamiltonian h above, since at this stage the constraint
(26) is an identity.

by straightforward calculation one nally obtains the hamiltonian expressed in terms of

canonical variables from the denition (45),

h =

2 zv

d3x(cid:16)k(a)c, k(a)c(cid:17) ,

(46)

where the quantity c is the appropriate solution to the system of linear elliptic partial dier-
ential equations (41), as discussed previously.

5 the hamiltonian equations of motion

the hamiltonian equations of motion are obtained by functional dierentiation of the hamil-
tonian (46) with respect to the canonical momenta and coordinates, respectively.

the equations of motion for the coordinates are as follows,

aa

k(x0, x) 

h
a(x0, x)

k

= (k(a)(a0 {a}  c))a  a
k,

(47)

which agree precisely with the expressions (44) as they should. in the calculation leading to
eq. (47) one encounters the following surface term,

lim

rz|x|<r

d3xk(c, k(a)c) = lim

rz dr2(c, (r)(a)c),

(48)

8

which must vanish in order that the functional derivative in eq. (47) be well dened. the
surface term (48) in question vanishes as it should, in view of the general boundary conditions
(43) imposed on the quantity c {a, }.

the calculation of the functional derivative of the hamiltonian (46) with respect to the
generalized coordinate variables aa
k is fairly lengthy, but nevertheless straightforward. in the
course of the calculation one nds that a surface term analoguous to eq. (20) has to vanish in
order that the functional derivative in question be well dened, i.e. that

lim

rz|x|=r

dr2(cid:16)a0[a], (r)(a)a0 {a}  a(r)(cid:17) = 0.

(49)

the condition (49) is quite non-trivial.
it should be remembered, that the variation of the
quantity a0 can not be declared to vanish outside some nite region, since a0 is a dependent
variable, determined by gauss law, i.e. in the present case by eq. (36). under essentially the
conditions (37) with  > 0, i have been able to prove, that the iterative solution of the eqns.
(36), which are equivalent to the system of partial dierential equations (27) with the boundary
conditions (31) and (32), is such that, for large | x |,

a0(a)(x0, x) = o  1

| x |! ,

(50)

for any local variations a. if one assumes that  > 1 in the discussion above, it is essentially
trivial to show conclusively that eq. (50) is valid. however, i will proceed by assuming that
eq. (50) is valid also if one merely takes  > 0, which is a plausible assumption as discussed
above.

if the conditions (37) and (50) are valid, or more precisely if the condition (49) is in force,

then one obtains,

a(x0, x)  
k

h
k(x0, x)

aa

= ig[a0 {a}  c, k(a)c + k]a

(51)

+(cid:16)gk(a)(cid:17)a

 ig[c, k(a)a0 {a}]a.

the pairs of equations, (47) and (51) are supposed to be equivalent to the original eld
equations (9). i will analyse this equivalence below. for this purpose it is convenient to note
that the equations (47) and (51) admit a constant of motion,

0(k(a)k) = 0,

(52)

which is crucial for the establishing of the equivalence between eqns. (9) and the hamiltonian
equations of motion (47) and (51). recalling the equation (41) dening the quantity c together
with the boundary conditions (43), one nds using eq. (52) that

k(a)k(a)c = k1,

(53)

where k1 denotes a constant.

9

so, if the equations of motion for the canonical variables a and , respectively, are in
force, then the quantity c is determined by the equation (53), where the constant k1 is so far
unknown.

eliminating the canonical momentum variables  between the equations (47) and (51) one

obtains the following equations,

(a)gk(a) + k(a) c + 2igh ak, ci = 0 , k = 1, 2, 3.

at this point one should recall that gauss law is in force by construction,

k(a)g0k(a) = 0.

(54)

(55)

were it not for the terms involving the quantity c in eqns. (54) one could now conclude that
the hamiltonian equations of motion (47) and (51) are equivalent to the original eld equations
(9). in order to obtain the required equivalence one must demand that

k(a) c + 2igh ak, ci = 0,

(56)

simultaneously with the hamiltonian equations of motion. in this situation the quantity c is
determined by the partial dierential equations (53). however, it does not appear to be possible
to prove that the unique solution to (53) also satises (56) if the constant k1 has an arbitrary
value, dierent from zero. however if

then substituting this value in eq. (53) one obtains the nal equation determining the quantity
c, when all the other equations of motion are in force,

k1 = 0,

(57)

k(a)k(a)c = 0.

(58)

but eq. (58) has only the trivial solution c = 0 in the class of functions satisfying the boundary
conditions (43) as discussed previously. hence if the constant of integration k1 in eq. (53)
equals zero, then eq. (56) is trivially true, whence the hamiltonian equations (47) and (51) are
completely equivalent to the original eld equations (9). thus by demanding that the condition
(57) be valid, one obtains complete equivalence between the original eld equations (9) and the
hamiltonian equations of motion (47) and (51) which have been obtained using the generalized
coulomb gauge condition (26).

it is now appropriate to return to the hamiltonian (46). this hamiltonian diers in a non-
trivial way from the hamiltonian in the weyl gauge, i.e. from the expression (15), mainly due
to the c -dependent terms in the former expression, but also due to the fact that a non-trivial
a0-dependence is possible in the case of the hamiltonian (46). the fact that the functional
c {a, } actually becomes zero when all the equations of motion are in force, does not mean
that one can set c equal to zero in the hamiltonian (46) and use the resulting expression
to generate the appropriate equations of motion by means of functional dierentiation. the
functional dependence of the quantity c {a, } in the hamiltonian (46) is essential in order to
generate the proper equations of motion.

10

finally i comment briey on the possibilities to generalize the considerations in this paper
to a situation in which one couples the yang-mills eld to e.g. a fermionic eld. the eld
equations (9) then get replaced by the following,

(a)g(a) = j   g tat a,

(59)

to which one has to add the eld equations for the fermionic elds. also in this case is it
possible to use the generalized coulomb gauge condition (26) so that the gauss law takes the
form

k(a)k(a)a0 = j0.

(60)

the construction of the canonical variables and hamiltonian in this case, along similar lines
to those presented here for the pure yang-mills case, does not meet with any diculties of
principle. likewise, coupling the yang-mills eld to a scalar eld also gives rise to a system
which has a canonical structure. details of these constructs as well as some mathematical detail
only briey touched upon in this paper will be given in future publications [8].
