abstract

in the frame of the scalar theory 4, we explore the occurrence of
thermal renormalons, i. e.
temperature dependent singularities in
the borel plane. using thermoeld dynamics, we found in fact a
series of singularities of this kind, which are located to the right of
the well known zero temperature pole, being therefore of a subleading
character in the ambiguity of the borel sum.

1 introduction

during the last years, there have been an impressive amount of theoretical
work on renormalons in dierent scenarios. for a recent review see [1]. one
of the main motivations behind this eort concerns the non perturbative
structure of quantum chromodynamics (qcd). on the other side, nite
temperature eects have also called the attention of many authors [2], due
to their crucial role in understanding new thermal aspects of the hadron
dynamics, whith special emphasis on the deconning phase transition and the
production of the quark gluon plasma [3]. it seems natural, therefore, to start
a systematic study of the occurrence and also the possible phenomenological
role of thermal renormalons. here we discuss, as a rst step in this direction,
the scalar theory 4. in spite of being a non realistic approach, this analysis
will allow us to gain a rst impression on this kind of eects.

in this paper we explore in detail the extension to the nite temperature
scenario of one kind of relevant feynman diagrams, see fig. 1, that contribute
to the two-point function. these diagrams are related to the existence of
a pole in the borel plane in the usual zero temperature situation. for that
purpose we will make use of the machinery of thermo field dynamics (tfd)
[4], nding a whole series of new temperature dependent singularities, which
are, however, of a subleading type with respect to the zero temperature
singularity. the situation in qcd, where infrared renormalons are present,
will be probably dierent, due to the long side thermal correlations which
could be signicant in this case.

the plan of this paper is as follows. in section 2 we briey review how
a zero temperature renormalon in 4 theory appears, as a consequence of a
particular kind of feynman diagrams contributing to the two-point function.
section 3 is devoted to a brief discussion of how to handle the chain of
bubbles shown in fig. 2 [5]. this will be done at nite temperature in the
deep euclidean region, i. e. p2  m2, and will be use in section 4 where
we calculate at nite temperature our renormalon-type diagram (fig. 1),
nding, nally, the location and residues of the new thermal renormalons.

2 the zero temperature renormalon

in the present paper the diagram shown in fig. 1 will be taken as a
source for renormalons. let us call the order k diagram by rk(p) where k
denotes the number of vertices.
in order to x our notation, rst we will
review the usual zero temperature calculation for the renormalon asociated
to this diagram [6].

this expression is ultraviolet divergent. to make it convergent the prop-
agator is expanded in powers of 1/q2 and the rst two ultraviolet divergent

expansion, the dependence on p, the external momentum, dissapears. so we

it is not dicult to see that the main contribution to rk, for large values
of k, comes from the large q region. introducing the new variable q = et, rk
becomes proportional to the gamma function.

3 chain of bubbles at nite temperature

in this section we revise the nite temperature calculation for the chain
of bubbles shown in fig. 2, which contribute to the four-point function. the
original discussion can be found in [5]. later we will consider an appropriate
approximation for our case. let us denote by ik the sum of all diagrams
of the form shown in fig. 2, with k bubbles and xed external vertices of
type one, including a global imaginary factor i. the sum is over all possible
combinations of internal type of vertices, which, as we know, can be of rst
or second type, according to the feynman rules in tfd.

as it was shown in [5], and after correcting some missprints, ik can be

expressed as a function of i1 according to

from the zero temperature calculation we know that the renormalon type
contribution given by the diagram shown in fig. 1 comes from the deep eu-

clidean region. specically from p2  ek/2 where k is the number of

bles shown in fig. 1, we will check if the previous condition, p2  ek/2,
first we calculate im i1 and re i1 for t 6= 0. from the four s that
appear in im i1 , it is easy to see that only those whose arguments included
energy dierences survive in the deep euclidean limit. so we have

the integral in the region where the logarithm can be expanded in powers of
4k|~p|/(p2). in the previous expression, q denotes a certain bound for the
integration in k such that for values of k bigger than q, the contribuition to
the integral turns out to be negligible due to the exponential supression. by
expanding the logarithm, at the end we can take q  . the real part,
then, can be written as a series in powers of 1/p2

4 renormalons at nite temperature

using eq. 27 for the chain of bubbles, the renormalon diagram shown
in fig. 1 will be calculated in the frame of tfd. at nite temperature,
rk(t ) denotes the sum of all diagrams of the shape shown in fig. 1 with
k vertices, being the external vertices of the rst type. as it was the case
in the chain of bubbles, the sum is over all possible combinations of internal
type of vertices. in order to use the result of the previous section, this sum
must be performed before the integral over the internal momentum that
circulates through the chain of bubbles. here we will obtain an expression
for rk(t ), nding the location of the induced poles in the borel plane and
the corresponding residues.

the expression we have to deal with is

the zero temperature contribution arises from the zero temperature part
of the propagator times the zero temperature part of ik1. we would like now
to discuss the following two cases: a) the thermal part of the propagator times
the zero temperature part of ik1, ra
k the usual zero temperature
propagator times the rst thermal correction to ik1, rb
k, according to the
series given in eq. 27.

although the delta function forbids the deep euclidean region, after inte-
grating in q0, we can examine the limit when |~q|  m nding that case a)
turns out to be proportional to

(32)

the sum over k in this expression is borel summable and, therefore, it

does not imply any new renormalon.

tion, rb,0

where the maxima of the rst and second terms are reached at t = log(q2)
 k/2 and t  k/4 respectively. note that the assumption we made in the
previous section, p2  ek/2, changes for the second term, due to the factor
4 instead of 2. this fact does not aect our approximations.

by doing the integration, we see that rb,0
k

is proportional to

rb,0

(35)

we see that those terms proportional to the product of the tempera-
ture dependent part of the propagator times the whole series of ik are borel
summable, since the leading term in the series of ik, case a), is already borel
summable. on the contrary, the zero temperature part of the propagator
times ik gives us a series of terms that behave like k! being, therefore, non
borel summable. we have calculated explicitely the rst temperature depen-
dent term of this series associated to a k! behavior.

if we perform the borel transform b[b] of the sum p rk, by taking into

account only those non-summable borel terms, we nd:

this expression shows us the rst thermal singularity in the borel plane,
and the dots denote the other new singularities, a whole series to the right
of the rst one. this is shown in fig. 3.

summarizing, in this paper we have shown the existence of a series of
new singularities in the borel plane, located to the right with respect to
the normal, zero temperature leading pole. note that the location of these
singularities does not depend on temperature. actually, the position of the
singularities is related to the expansion of the logarithms coming from the

bubbles in powers of 1/p2. the residues, on the contrary, have an explicit
dependence on temperature through the factors fn() which vanish when
t  0.
