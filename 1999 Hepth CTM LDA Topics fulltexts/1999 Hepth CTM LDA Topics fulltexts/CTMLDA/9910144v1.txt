we express the innite sum of d-vebrane instanton corrections to r2 couplings in
n = 4 type i string vacua, in terms of an elliptic index counting 1
2 -bps excitations
in the eective sp(n ) brane theory. we compute the index explicitly in the infrared,
where the eective theory is argued to ow to an orbifold cft. the form of the
instanton sum agrees completely with the predicted formula from a dual one-loop
computation in type iia theory on k3 t 2. the proposed cft provides a proper
description of the whole spectrum of masses, charges and multiplicities for 1
2 - and
4 - bps states, associated to bound states of d5-branes and kk momenta. these
results are applied to show how vebrane instanton sums, entering higher derivative
couplings which are sensitive to 1
4 -bps contributions, also match the perturbative
results in the dual type iia theory.

1 introduction

string dualities often map worldsheet instanton eects on one string vacuum to space-
time instantons in the dual one [1, 2]. a perturbative computation in one side can
then be used to shed light about the general rules of the instanton calculus in string
theory. this idea motivates the study of [3], where heterotic world-sheet instanton
corrections to four-derivative couplings in toroidal compactications to eight dimen-
sions were translated into a sum of d-instanton eects in the dual type i side. the
analysis was extended to lower dimensional (d > 4) hetetoric/type i toroidal compact-
ications [4] and to n = 4 dual pairs of type ii string vacua [5, 6].
in each of the
cases the n-instanton corrections, associated to bound states of n d-string wrapping
the t 2-spacetime torus, were expressed in terms of elliptic genera counting the number
of 1
2 -bps excitations in the relevant o(n ) gauge theories. the analyses were always
restricted to d > 4 dimensions where the less understood vebrane physics is irrele-
vant. the aim of this paper is to extend to d = 4 dimensions these results by explicitly
computing the d5-instanton eects in the type i brane theory.

we will consider instanton corrections to higher derivative couplings in toroidally com-
pactied type i theory down to four dimensions. the only sources of non-perturbative
corrections (to the kind of couplings we will consider) in these string vacua are associated
to euclidean d5-branes wrapping entirely the t 6-torus, whose bps excitations can be
properly described, as we will see, by an n = (4, 4) orbifold cft. less supersymmetric
instanton congurations would have too many fermionic zero modes to be soaked by the
vertex insertions (typically r2), while d-string instantons leads to n = (8, 0) eective
sigma models [7], where the vertex insertions can soak at most four of the eight left
moving fermionic zero modes.
we will work out the details for r2 couplings and comment about the generalizations to
other four and higer derivative bps saturated terms. these couplings are special in
that they receive corrections only from states saturing the bps bounds and they have
been extensively studied in many contexts [8]-[12]. in this paper we will concentrate
in the non-perturbative part of the corrections to d = 4 eective lagrangians in type i
vacua with sixteen supercharges. the instanton sums will be always expressed in terms
of an elliptic genus in the eective sp(n ) gauge theory, which encodes the information
about masses, charges and multiplicties of 1
2 bps excitations in the corresponding d5-
brane system. we will compute the quasi topological index and show that the form
of the instanton corrections to the associated couplings agree with the predictions from
duality to type iia on k3 t 2. interestingly, the cft description of the infrared limit
of the d5-brane world-volume theory reproduces the right multiplicities even for 1
4 -bps
states, associated to d5-kk bound states. we apply this result to show that instanton
corrections to certain higher derivative couplings, sensitive to these states, agree again

1

with the fundamental type iia results1.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we compute d5-instanton corrections to
r2-couplings in type i theory on t 6, and compare it to the perturbative result obtained
in the dual type iia theory. in section 3, we briey discuss the extension of such results
to other higher derivative terms, which are sensitive to 1
4 bps contributions. section 4
summarizes the results and present some conclusions.

2 r2 couplings in type iia/type i n = 4 string vacua

as we have discussed in the introduction, worldsheet/spacetime instantons in type iia
theory on k3  t 2/type i theory on t 6 are mapped to each other under the triality
map

tiia = sh = si .

(2.1)

the subscripts iia, h, i refer to the type ii, heterotic and type i theories, while the
complex moduli2

tiia = b45 + ig
sh = a + iv6

si = a + iv6


.

(2.2)

describe the complexied kahler structure of the t 2 torus in the type iia side, and the
four dimensional complexied string couplings in the heterotic and type i string vacua
respectively with v6 the t 6-volume. more precisely, a = b456789, where b is dened by
d b = db, b being the second rank, antisymmetric tensor in the corresponding string
theory, and  = e the ten-dimensional string coupling.

in this section we will show how the perturbative, world-sheet instanton contribution
to the r2 coupling in the type iia theory, can be directly reproduced in type i theory,
using the eective six dimensional, n = 1, gauge theory of d5 branes, in the limit
where it ows to a two dimensional n = (4, 4) orbifold conformal field theory, after
dimensional reduction on a four-torus.

2.1 one-loop r2 couplings in type iia
let us start by recalling the results for the moduli depence gr(t, u ) of r2-couplings
in type iia theory on k3  t 2 [8, 9] 3. perturbative corrections to r2 terms in (2, 2)
string vacua are expected to arise only at one-loop level, and depend only on the t (u )

1the couplings under consideration, are closely related to those studied in [12].
2in this paper, all quantities having dimension of a length will be understood in units of 2.
3we will follow the notations and normalizations of [9].

see that z(v, v) receives in general contributions from both bps and non-bps string
states. this is not the case for the chiral supertrace (v| ), introduced in (2.4). indeed,
the insertion of two rs in (2.5) soaks precisely four right-moving fermionic zero modes
(after spin structure sums), while massive bosonic and fermionic right moving excita-
tions, cancel against each other by supersymmetry, giving as a result the holomorphic
function (v| )4. this chiral supertrace encodes all the information about bps multi-
plicities and charges, and we will refer to it as the elliptic genus of the corresponding
conformal eld theory. specializing to the case of type iia string theory on k3  t 2,
we get, after summing over the spin structures,

ular integration in (2.3) can be done using the standard trick [13], where fundamental
domain integrals are unfolded to the strip (degenerated orbits detm = 0) and to the
whole upper half plane (non-degenerated orbits detm 6= 0) integrals of certain sl(2, z)
representatives. the nal result is [8, 9]

gr(t ) = 36 log(cid:16)t2 |(t )|4(cid:17) .

(2.11)

using the duality relations (2.1) we can rewrite this in terms of the type i variables:

gr(s) = 36 log(cid:16)s2 |(s)|4(cid:17) = 36 log s2 + 12s2

where n|m stands for the partitions of n (n = lm with n, l, m  z). the rst term
in (2.12) corresponds to a logarithmic divergence in the weak coupling limit s2 = v6
 
, the second term come from a disk diagram contribution and the rest is an innite
sum of d-instanton corrections. the logarithmic divergent term in (2.12) is attributed
to an ir divergence, but a complete understanding is still missing (see [14, 15] for
details).
it has been shown in [11] that r2 couplings receive a resulting non-vanishing one-loop
contributions from the klein, annulus and moebius in type i theory. the absence of
the one-loop term in the perturbative formula (2.12) suggests that the r2 result in
type iia should correspond to a combination of r2 together with other four derivative
couplings in the type i side. for instance, the authors of [11] have shown that a suitable
combination of r2 and f 2
2 can account for the discrepancy. one can see that four-
derivative couplings involving the dilaton eld will lead again to a one-loop expression
similar to its closely related partner r2, making them potential sources to take into
 = v4egi
account the perturbative discrepancy. moreover, the duality relation giia
suggests that in the translation of the type iia r2 term in the type i variables four-
derivative couplings constructed out of the dilaton and volume modulus should indeed
be relevant. our instanton computation will not give a denite answer to this question,
but it will support these latter sources. the comparison with the perturbative formula
will account then only for the form of the instanton sums, leaving an overall coecient
to be accounted for by the right combination of four derivative terms in type i dual to
the type iia r2 coupling.
a similar formula (with s replaced by sh in (2.12)) describe the instanton corrections
in the heterotic side. the correct instanton action weights e2in sh were reproduced
in [14] from the classical action of heterotic ns-vebranes wrapped on the t 6 torus,

for the spacetime torus the limit in which the volume of a t 4 torus in t 6 becomes very

small (ri  , i = 6, 7, 8, 9) keeping r4, r5 xed when the d5-brane theory decouples
from gravity   0. we will reduce the six-dimensional world-volume theory onto this
two-dimensional plane with light cone coordinates x = x 4  x 5.
the classical part of the computation in the d5-instanton background closely follows
the one for the heterotic ns-vebrane [14] with obvious modications. the low en-

tive computation in the one-loop worldsheet instanton background of the last section,
with the worldsheet parameter  replaced by the complex structure u of the target

we really need, by determining the whole bps elliptic genus (v| ). we will follow the
strategy of [7, 5]. the elliptic genus, being invariant under any deformation of the gauge
theory, in particular under variation of the string coupling constant, can be evaluated
in the regime which is more convenient for our purposes. we will compute it explicitly
in the infrared limit, where the theory will be argued to ow to an orbifold conformal

the same line are related by the n = (4, 4) supersymmetry. we will consider a generic
type i background involving wilson lines on t 4, which break so(32) down to u (1)16.
in the strong coupling limit g   of the coulomb branch of the above gauge theory,
the o-diagonal elds get innite masses and can be integrated out (see [7] for a detailed
analysis) leaving a free (up-to a weyl group orbifolding) conformal eld theory in terms

the semi-direct product sn  z n

as 2, and therefore reecting the elds proportional to 3 while leaving invariant the
ones proportional to the identity i2. the breaking of the sp(n ) gauge group down to
sn  z n
2 can be understood in two steps. first by giving generic expectation values to
the diagonal entries in x (d5-brane positions) we break the group to sp(1)n with the
weyl group sn permuting the branes. one can then further break each sp(1) to its
weyl subgroup z2 by turning on the su (2) wilson lines aa a. alternatively, one can
start from the type i theory and perform four t-dualites on the small t 4 directions.
the - projection goes under the t-duality map to i4, introducing 16 5-orientifold
planes whose charges are localy canceled with the inclusion of d5-branes symmetrically

with ps sns = n . however, as it has been shown in [7], only the sectors belonging to
the conjugacy classes of the kind [g] = (l)m (with n = lm ) will lead to a non trivial
contribution to (v| ). sectors with strings of dierent lengths [g] = (l1)m1(l2)m2 ...

to vanishing contributions to (v| ). the elliptic index (v| ) can then be computed

one can easily extend the previous results to other four derivative couplings in the d = 4

gauge elds coming from the reduction of the metric on the t 2 torus (f = [g]i,
with i = 4, 5). the analysis follows closely our previous one for the r2 computation,
with an eective coupling of the gauge eld to the instanton background given in this
case by

simplicity we take a rectangular spacetime torus, i.e. u = iu2). the result reproduces
exactly the contributions from non-degenerate orbits to the one-loop formula for similar

same n dependence of the r2 term, making them potential candidates to account for
the perturbative discrepancy and the factor of 2 in the non-perturbative contribution.

multipicities and charges for the bound states can be read from the longest string sector

right moving modes on their ground state (nr  cr = 0) and identifying k with the
kk momentum along the direction where the string wraps. the bound state degen-
nlcl
eracies are dened by the coecients in the expansion of (2.23) in powers of q
.
in particular the ground state multiplicities (q0 order) counts the number of ultrashort
supermultiplets, associated to bound states of n d5-branes, while degeneracies in the
excited left moving part of the cft (coecient of qk with k > 0) are associated to
bound states of n d5 branes with k units of kaluza-klein longitudinal momenta, which
sit in intermediate supermultiplets. the expansion clearly coincide with the similar one
for the fundamental result (2.6). we conclude then that the whole spectrum of masses,
charges and multiplicities of 1
4 -bps excitations in the d5-brane system agree
with the s-duality predictions. in the next section we will give an application of these
results.

4-bps saturated couplings in type i theory

in this section we consider higher derivative couplings which are sensitive to 1
4 -bps
contributions. instanton corrections to type i thresholds will translate again into an
innite sum of one-loop contributions coming from t 2-wrapping modes of type iia fun-
damental strings running in the loop, the novelty being in the fact that now 1
4 -bps
fundamental strings will be the relevant ones. the type iia perturbative computa-
tion follows with slight modications from the ones appering in [12], reference that can
be consulted for details and a more complete discussion. we will consider in particu-
lar the (4+g)-derivative couplings fl flf g
l, with f l  [(g]z + b]z) the left
moving combination of u (1) gauge elds arising from the reduction of the metric and
antisymmetric tensor on t 2

the relevant string amplitude is given by

at the order of momenta, we are interested in, one can see that the leftt moving part
in the vertices (3.2) enters only through their zero mode part. indeed, after soaking
the (4, 4) fermionic zero modes the remaining extra g powers of momenta are necesarily
carried out by the right moving pieces of the vertices (3.2) and therefore the left moving
part reduces eectively to the pl, pl bosonic zero modes of z and  z respectively. the

the t ii

(subleading orders in si

following only the leading order in this expansion. the analysis of subleading quantum
corrections to this result can be done following the techniques in [6]. at this order 
derivatives hit always the terms proportional to t2 and set the remaining -dependent
terms to zero. the  derivatives hit all the time the exponential leading to an overall
(n2m1t2)g factor. altogether we are left with

where h.c. stands for hermitian conjugation and dots for the higher orders in t2 expan-
sion. it is now straight to compare this result with the corresponding string amplitudes
in the instanton background.
indeed, the partition function for the nd5-instanton
in the presence of a background (3.3) is described by the elliptic genus (2.20), whose
v-derivatives coincide with the fundamental result (3.7) after trivial identications.

the presence of perturbative corrections around the instanton background is a new
feature of these higher derivative couplings, to be contrasted with the r2 case. it would
be interesting to compare (along the lines of [6]) the fundamental and d-instanton
results for these quantum corrections, where the born-infeld nature of the instanton
couplings are strongly tested. notice in particular that insertions of f l gauge elds
appears already at a quantum level. a complete analysis of the quantum subleading
terms would determine the moduli dependence of the additional couplings in the eective
lagrangian.

notice also that for the case g = 4, the result (3.5) is proportional to 2,2.
indeed
f42,2 is nothing but the helicity supertrace b6  str6 for type iia string theory on
k3 t 2, where  is the 4-dimensional physical helicity. b6 in this case is therefore only
sensitive to short multiplets [24], the intermediate ones give vanishing contribution to
this helicity supertrace, however this accident will clearly not persist for the rest of the
asymmetric supertraces generated by (v| ).

4 conclusions

in this paper we have considered instanton corrections to four and higher derivative
couplings in d = 4 type i string vacua with sixteen supercharges. we restricted our
attention to couplings for which euclidean d5-brane wrapping the t 6 torus represent
the only source of instanton corrections. d-string instantons have been extensively
studied in [3]-[6] and are fairly better understood. the couplings we consider are also
special in the sense that they are sentitive only to states sitting in short and intermediate
multiplets of the n = 4 supersymmetry.
we have worked it out the details of the instanton sums for r2 thresholds in toroidal
compactications of type i string theory. the instanton sums translate, under the
duality map, into a sum over wrapping modes of fundamental type iia strings on the
t 2 part of k3  t 2. we argued that the relevant 6-dimensional sp(n ) gauge theory
ows in the infrared to an orbifold conformal xed point, after dimensional reduction
to 1+1 dimensions. the elliptic genus for the orbifold cft was computed in this
limit and shown to reproduce correctly the whole spectrum of 1
2 bps masses, charges
and multiplicities, as required by type i/type iia duality. as a consequence, the whole
innite sum of instanton corrections to four derivative couplings agree with the expected
result from the iia fundamental string side.

12

the proposed cft reproduce also the right multiplicities for 1
4 -bps states associated
to bound states of d5 branes and kk momenta in the type i theory, providing several
more examples of higher derivative couplings where the worldsheet/spacetime instanton
correspondence works properly.

besides supporting type iia/type i duality in d = 4 dimensions, we believe the results
reported here motivate a deeper study of d5-brane conformal eld theory description
in type i theory, rather less understood than its type iib parents. an exciting direc-
tion would be the study of conformal eld theory description of other 1
4 -bps magnetic
charges in the type i side. in particular, unlike in the type iib case where an available
orbifold cft description of bps excitations in the d1-d5 system exists, the type i
analog is still missing. the role of these states in the ads/cft correpondence, as well
as of the 1

4 -bps bound states studied here, deserves a deeper attention.
