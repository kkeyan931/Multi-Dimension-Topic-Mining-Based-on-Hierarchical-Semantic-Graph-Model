abstract

corresponding to the izergin-korepin (a(2)

2 ) r matrix, there are three diagonal
solutions (k matrices) of the boundary yang-baxter equation. using these r and
k matrices, one can construct transfer matrices for open integrable quantum spin
chains. the transfer matrix corresponding to the identity matrix k = i is known
to have uq(o(3)) symmetry. we argue here that the transfer matrices corresponding
to the other two k matrices also have uq(o(3)) symmetry, but with a nonstandard
coproduct. we briey explore some of the consequences of this symmetry.

1 introduction and summary

the notion of coproduct is of fundamental importance in the theory of representations of
algebras. given a representation of an algebra on a vector space v , the coproduct  de-
termines the representation on the tensor product space v  v . for a classical lie algebra,
the coproduct is trivial: for any generator x, the coproduct is (x) = x  i + i  x, where
i is the identity matrix. for quantum algebras, the situation is more interesting. indeed,
consider the case uq(su(2)), with a set of three generators {j , h} obeying

as is well known, the standard coproduct

[h , j] = j .

(h) = h  i + i  h ,

(j) = j  qh + qh  j ,

is compatible with the commutation relation

[j+ , j] =

q2h  q2h

q  q1

.

perhaps less well-known is the fact that there is also a nonstandard coproduct

(h) = h  i + i  h ,

(j) = j  i + qh  j ,

which is compatible instead with the q-commutation relation

j+j  q1jj+ =

i  q2h
1  q2

.

remarkably, both of these types of coproducts can be realized in the open integrable
quantum spin chain constructed with the a(2)
2 r matrix [1] by choosing appropriate bound-
ary conditions. let us briey recall the history of this model. sklyanin [2] pioneered the
generalization of the quantum inverse scattering method [3] to systems with boundaries,
and showed that integrable boundary conditions can be obtained from solutions k(u) of
the boundary yang-baxter equation [4], [5]. this approach was then generalized [6] to spin
chains associated with general ane lie algebras [7], [8]. in particular, for the a(2)
case,
2
it was found [9] that there are only three diagonal solutions of the boundary yang-baxter
equation:

k (0)(u) = i = diag(cid:16)1 , 1 , 1(cid:17) ,

k (1)(u) = diag(cid:16)eu ,

k (2)(u) = diag(cid:16)eu ,

where u is the spectral parameter, and  is the anisotropy parameter. let us denote the
corresponding transfer matrices for open quantum spin chains with n sites by t(i)(u), i =
0 , 1 , 2. (the construction of these transfer matrices is described below in section 2.) it was
shown in [10], [11] that the transfer matrix t(0)(u) constructed with the identity matrix k (0)
has uq(o(3)) symmetry:

(cid:2)t(0)(u) , s (cid:3) = 0 ,

(cid:2)t(0)(u) , s3(cid:3) = 0 ,

where the generators obey

(cid:2)s3 , s (cid:3) = s  ,

and q = e. that is, the transfer matrix has quantum algebra symmetry with the standard
coproduct (2). this is a generalization of the observation [12], [13] of uq(su(2)) symmetry
for the a(1)
spin chain can be

mapped to the problem of polymers at surfaces, and that the above three solutions k (i)(u)
correspond to three distinct surface critical behaviors.

case. batchelor and yung [14] later showed that the open a(2)

there has remained the question: what symmetry  if any  do the transfer matrices
constructed with k (1) and k (2) have? naively, one expects that since k 6= i, there is less
symmetry. 1 however, this is not the case. we argue here that the transfer matrices t(1)(u)
and t(2)(u) also have uq(o(3)) symmetry, but with a nonstandard coproduct (4):

(cid:2)t(i)(u) , s (cid:3) = 0 ,

(cid:2)t(i)(u) , s3(cid:3) = 0 ,

i = 1 , 2 ,

(11)

1this expectation holds true for the a(1)

n case [15]. indeed, there the diagonal k matrices contain an

additional continuous parameter ; and k = i is a point (  ) of enhanced symmetry.

and q = e4. knowledge of such symmetry is essential for understanding important features
of the models such as degeneracies of the spectrum and the bethe ansatz solution. eqs.
(11) - (14) are the main results of this letter. in section 2 we provide some pertinent details
about the construction and symmetry of the models, and we conclude in section 3 with a
brief discussion.

2 some details

in this section, we briey review the construction of the transfer matrices, and outline the
argument for their symmetry. the solution r(u) of the yang-baxter equation found by
izergin and korepin [1], which corresponds [7],[8] to the case a(2)
2 , can be written in the
following form [16], [11]

it has the regularity property r(0)  p, where p is the permutation matrix, as well as
unitarity, p t symmetry, and crossing symmetry

and  = 6  i.

given a solution k(u) of the boundary yang-baxter equation, a corresponding transfer
matrix t(u) for an open integrable quantum spin chain with n sites is given by [2], [6], [15]

where

with

and

t(u) = tr0 m0k0(u  )t0t0(u) ,

t0(u) = t0(u) k0(u) t0(u) ,

t0(u) = r0n (u)    r01(u) ,

t0(u) = r10(u)    rn 0(u) ,

m = v tv = diag(cid:16)e2 , 1 , e2(cid:17) .

indeed, the transfer matrix forms a one-parameter commutative family [t(u) , t(v)] = 0,
which contains the hamiltonian h,

h 

d
du

t(u)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u=0

.

(22)

for the three k matrices k (i)(u) given in eq. (6), we denote by t(i)(u) the corresponding
transfer matrices, and by h(i) the corresponding hamiltonians. we now restrict our attention

4

to the cases i = 1 , 2. for 2 sites (n = 2), we have checked the uq(o(3)) symmetry (11) - (14)
of the transfer matrix by direct computation. in particular, eq. (22) implies that the 2-site
hamiltonian also has this symmetry. for general n, the hamiltonian is given by a sum of
2-site hamiltonians plus boundary terms. it follows that, for general n, the hamiltonian
h(i) has uq(o(3)) symmetry

(cid:2)h(i) , s (cid:3) = 0 ,

(cid:2)h(i) , s3(cid:3) = 0 ,

i = 1 , 2 ,

(23)

where the symmetry generators obey (12) - (14). we have also checked the symmetry (11)
of the transfer matrix for 3 sites (n = 3) by direct computation, and we conjecture that it
holds for general n.

we remark that the symmetry generators s , s3 dened in (13), (14) lie in the funda-
mental algebraic structures of qism. indeed, note the asymptotic behavior of the r and k
matrices for u   :

r(u)  eur+ + r++ + o(eu) ,

k (i)(u)  euk (i)+ + k (i)++ + o(eu) ,

i = 1 , 2 ,

(24)

(25)

where r+ , r++ , k (i)+ , k (i)++ are independent of u.
dened as in eq. (19) has the asymptotic behavior for u  

it follows that the quantity t (i)(u)

t (i)(u)  e(2n +1)ut (i)+ + e2n ut (i)++ + . . . ,

(26)

where t (i)+ , t (i)++ are independent of u. the basic observation is that the generators s 
lie in the antidiagonal corners of t (i)++ (viewed as a 3  3 auxiliary-space matrix, with
operator-valued entries):

t (i)++ =




0 s 
0

0

s+ 





.

(27)

we expect that this observation will be useful for formulating a qism proof of the symmetry
(11).

3 discussion

one immediate consequence of the symmetry which we have uncovered is the explanation of
degeneracies in the spectrum for nite n. for instance, consider the pseudovacuum vector

5

 =




1
0
0

n




,

t(i)(u)  = (i)(u)  ,

i = 1 , 2 ,

(28)

where (i)(u) is the corresponding pseudovacuum eigenvalue. commutativity of the transfer
matrix with s  implies that the vectors (s )n for n = 1 , 2 , . . . , n are also eigenvectors of
the transfer matrix with the same eigenvalue.

note that the pseudovacuum vector  is annihilated by s+; that is, s+ = 0. we expect
that all bethe ansatz states (which can presumably be constructed by applying appropriate
creation-like operators to ) are such highest-weight states. (see, e.g., [17], [10], [18], [19].)

finally, we remark that we have considered here only the rst of the innite family of
models a(2)
2n , n = 1 , 2 , . . .. for these r matrices [7], [8], there are again only three distinct
diagonal solutions of the boundary yang-baxter equation: k (0) = i [9], and k (1) , k (2) given
in [20]. the transfer matrix constructed with k (0) has [10] the symmetry uq(o(2n + 1)) with
the standard coproduct. we expect that the transfer matrices constructed with k (1) and
k (2) also have uq(o(2n + 1)) symmetry, but with a nonstandard coproduct. we hope to
report on this and related matters in a future publication.
