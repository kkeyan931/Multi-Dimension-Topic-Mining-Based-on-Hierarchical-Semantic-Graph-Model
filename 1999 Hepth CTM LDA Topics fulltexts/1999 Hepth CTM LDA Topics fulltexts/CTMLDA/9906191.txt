(66) proceed consider reduction metric constraints specied (61) (42): 1. conventional reduction 3d gravity  one imposes constraints (61) order satisfy brown-henneaux boundary conditions. metric takes form (25) = ka+ = j +. substituting representation currents (5) one nds j + = ()2 k 2 1 2 2, (67) expected liouville stress tensor generating virasoro algebra central charge8 c = 6k. 2. alternatively, may also reduce via constraints (42), obtaining metric ds2 = e2dzdz + d2 + 2a3dzd.
