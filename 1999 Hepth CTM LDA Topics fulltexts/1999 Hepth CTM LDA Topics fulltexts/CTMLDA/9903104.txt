therefore d1 2 = e3. note e3 (1) curve surfaces, hence compute normal bundle ne3/ b3 o(1) o(1). (4.1) blow-ups performed dierent order, roles d1, d2 interchanged, extra component e3 lies d2, 1. case, e3 = e2 e1. fact two models related op transition whose physical interpretation investigated

heuristically relate situation iia case rst going m-theory taking strong coupling limit iia conguration (in case fourbranes become vebranes along (01236&10)), compactifying x7 interval (s1/z2). emphasize heuristic, since analysis refs. {$9701162$} valid innite branes, vebranes compact (at least along wrapped curves). however, since geometric description heterotic/f-theory vacua strictly

heterotic picture above. conifold another interesting property: deformed smooth mani- fold. thus, expect able deform base b3 away conifold. heterotic dual deformation? shown {$9606122$} conifold metric deformed smooth metric threebranes sit node conifold. show case even absence threebranes, often deformations smooth singularity. consider following example, rst discussed {$9811240$}. consider

w(cid:1) w 21 (5.1) (5.2) shows k b3 w 2 = kw w = 2(c2)b2 . (5.3) therefore, divisors supported curves (c2)b2 = 1 contribute. base b2 fn, 0 n 2, follows superpotential generated n = 1. analysis {$9701162$} shows case, superpotential actually generated. ii) noncritical string instantons. regarding heterotic theory m-theory interval, two types noncritical strings corresponding membranes stretching two vebranes membranes stretching vebrane nine dimen- sional wall. eects associated instantons discussed {$9811240$}. bps strings whose tension proportional separation branes. therefore, taking account moduli map developed previous sections, naturally identied euclidean threebranes wrapping exceptional divisors f-theory. precisely, let us consider conguration k vebranes wrapping curve c b2 separated along interval. corresponding f-theory geometry consists sequence divisors d1, d2 . . . dk, dk+1 normal crossings explained section 4.2. threebranes wrapped divisors d1, dk+1 correspond membranes stretching rst last vebrane nine dimensional walls respec- tively. time, threebranes wrapped d1 . . . dk correspond membranes stretching consecutive vebranes. number zero modes computed using formula (5.1). fact simple local computation shows bers e1, ek+1 d1, dk+1 negative extremal rays blown-up threefold base, therefore apply results {$9701162$} (ex. 2.9.1 prop. 3.4). shows (od1 ) = (cid:0)odk+1(cid:1) = 1 g(c) (5.4) g(c) genus curve. moreover, shown {$9701162$} hodge numbers divisors h0,0 = 1, h0,1 = g(c), h0,2 = h0,3 = 0. (5.5) therefore divisors d1, dk+1 contribute c rational curve. formula apply middle divisors d1 . . . dk since bers negative extremal rays. number zero modes computed recursively follows. 22 simplicity consider case k = 2 represented g. 4. let ni, = 1, 2, 3 denote degrees rulings three divisors. note construction, n1 = n2 + (c2)b2 (5.6) divisors d1, d2 intersect along common section c12 isomorphic c. adjunction formula (5.2) shows k b3 d2 2 = (cid:0)kd2 d2 2(cid:1) d2 kd2 = 2c12 + (2g(c) 2 n2)e2. (5.7) (5.8) furthermore, local computation shows restriction normal bundle nd2/ b3 p 1 ber e2 degree 2. therefore, nd2/ b3 = 2c12 + ae2 (5.9) integer number determined follows. triple intersection d1d2 2 computed two equivalent ways d1d2 2 = (c2 12)d1 = n1 using also (5.6), nd = c12 d2 = 2n2 + a. = (c2)b2 n2. finally, (5.7), (5.8) (5.9) imply (5.10) (5.11) (od2 ) = (c2)b2 + 2g(c) 2 = c kb2 . (5.12) clear recursive step applied divisors d2 . . . dk yielding result. hodge numbers computed using general expressions {$9701162$} riemann-roch theorem di h0,0 = 1, h0,1 = g(c), h0,2 = c kb2 + g(c) 1, h0,3 = 0. (5.13) note exceptional case, namely b f2, c = c0 general formulae hold. case, obtain similarly h0,0 = 1, h0,1 = 1, h0,2 = h0,3 = 0. (5.14) 23 therefore, although c kb2 = 1 necessary condition generation superpo- tential, may sucient {$9701162$}. sucient condition also requires g(c) = 0, showing contribution certain rational curves satisfying (cid:0)c2(cid:1)b2 = 1. base hirzebruch surface degree 0 n 2, realized n = 1 c rational curve. iii) exceptional instantons. addition eects discussed far, also contributions coming resolution sections e8 singularities elliptic bration. shown {$9701162$} give expected gauge theoretic nonperturbative superpotentials discussed here. 5.1. toric description interesting also consider computation zero modes light toric geometry, provides method explicitly constructing calabiyau fourfolds hypersurfaces toric varieties. calabiyau fourfold x described dual pair dimensional reexive polyhedra (, ). particular, points correspond divisors calabiyau manifold. (see, example, {$9811240$} useful review). point p , arithmetic genus corresponding divisor calabiyau fourfold given formula {$9811240$}. p interior face p , p dual face (dened p = {q | < q, v >= 1, v p) = 4), l() number lattice points interior , formula {$9811240$} p}, note dim(p) + dim( (dp, o(dp)) = 1 (1)dim(p)l(p), (5.15) dp divisor x corresponding point p. (if dim( p) = 4, point p corresponds divisor embedding variety intersect space x, hence give divisor x). since studying f-theory compactications, x elliptic bration, i.e., projection : x b3 whose generic ber elliptic curve e, vertical divisors (which project divisors b3) ones contribute superpotential. now, theorems {$9811240$}, polyhedron contains slice e origin, e polyhedron describing elliptic ber (which torus, hence calabiyau) hypersurface toric variety. theorem also assures us exists projection acting , projects e point, whose image fan b3 b3. thus, points project points b3 , hence describe divisors b3. furthermore, order heterotic dual exist, x must also admit k3 bration consistent elliptic bration structure. implies b3 p 1 bered b2, base heterotic threefold z. 24 (-1,0,0) d1 d4 (0,-1,0) (0,0,1) d5 d2 (1,n,0) d3 (0,1,0) d6 (0,0,-1) (a) (0,1,1) d7 d8 d9 (0,1,-1) (0,1,-2) (b) p 1, base fourfold dual fig. 5: (a), fan fn,0,0 = fn heterotic compactication elliptic calabiyau threefold base fn. (b), fan fn,0,0 blown three times zero section c0 fn, corresponding three vebranes wrapping c0 heterotic base fn. k vebranes wrap curve c b2 corresponds toric divisor, corresponding base b3 acquires k blowup modes corresponding divisor (see g. 5). thus, get line points p1, p2, . . . , pk+1 project divisor c b2 projection p : b3 b2. fact points lie straight line indicates lie face . simplest cases, p1 pk+1 vertices , p2, . . . , pk lie edge joining p1 pk+1. general, p2, . . . , pk interior face , p1 pk+1 usually lie boundary , hence faces lower dimension. expression (5.15) yields result points interior given face . thus see immediately p2, . . . , pk exactly arithmetic genus, therefore, either contribute superpotential not. moreover, follows points p1 pk+1 dierent arithmetic genus. actually compute arithmetic genus divisors fourfold correspond heterotic worldsheet instantons noncritical string instantons follows. points fourfold x put form (x, y, z, u, v), slice (0, 0, 0, u, v) gives e , slice (0, 0, z, u, v) gives k3. projection p3 : 25 (x, y, z, u, v) (x, y, z) yields fan b3 b3, base elliptic bration, p2 : (x, y, z, u, v) (x, y) gives fan b2 base b2 k3 bration. points q satisfy < q, p > 1, p . terms , polyhedron k3 k3 ber seen projection k3 : {a, b, c, d, e} {c, d, e}, e elliptic ber given e : {a, b, c, d, e} {d, e}{$9811240$}. (we use round brackets denote points , curly brackets denote points .) example, polyhedron given points (1, 1, 0, 2, 3), (0, 1, 0, 2, 3), (0, 0, 1, 2, 3), (0, 0, 0, 2, 3), (0, 0, 0, 1, 2), (0, 0, 0, 1, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0, 2, 3), (0, 1, 0, 2, 3), (0, 0, 1, 2, 3) describes fourfold elliptically bered f1 p 1, also viewed k3 bration f1. consider rst case worldsheet instanton. corresponds point p projects point p b2 p2, describes divisor (curve) cp b2. cp cp 2, otherwise elliptic bration singular cp. case heterotic worldsheet instantons, rather instantons associated exceptional bers. cp cp > 2, point p vertex, whereas cp cp = 2, p interior edge. now, points q interior face satisfy < q, v >= 1, v < q, v > 0, v / (v ). contains reexive polyhedron k3 slice. point k3 non-negative product points k3 origin {0, 0, 0}, since, reexivity, unique interior point k3. since k3() = k3, follows points non- negative product points k3 form {a, b, 0, 0, 0}. now, points interior p must non-negative product point p. particular, non-negative product point k3 , must form {a, b, 0, 0, 0}. simple matter count l(p), number points interior p. cp cp > 2, nd l() = 1 + cp cp. since p vertex, dim(p) = 4, (5.15) gives (dp, o(dp)) = cp cp. using results {$9811240$} also nd h0,0 = 1, h1,0 = 0, h2,0 = 0, h3,0 = 1 + cp cp, superpotential generated cp cp = 1. 26 cp cp = 2, get l() = 1. dim(p) = 3 (since p must lie edge, otherwise fourfold x admit k3 bration consistent elliptic bration structure), (5.15) gives (dp, o(dp)) = 2 = cp cp. fact, nd h0,0 = 1, h1,0 = 0, h2,0 = 1, h3,0 = 0. consider case noncritical string instantons. line points p1, . . . , pk+1 project point p b2 . again, cp cp 2, otherwise exceptional bers. cp cp > 2 points pj, 2 j k lie edge 1,k+1 joining p1 pk+1. again, see points interior 1,k+1 form {a, b, 0, 0, 0}, l(1,k+1) = 1 + cp cp. thus, points pj, 2 j k, get, using dim(1,k+1) = 3 (5.15), (dpj , o(dpj )) = 2 + cp cp = kb2 cp. also nd h0,0 = 1, h1,0 = 0, h2,0 = 1 + cp cp = kb2 cp 1, h3,0 = 0. 1,k+1 common face 1 k+1. see points form {a, b, 0, 0, 0} 1 lie 1,k+1 hence cannot interior 1. therefore, l(1) = 0, similarly, l(k+1) = 0. thus get (dp1 , o(dp1)) = (dpk+1 , o(dpk+1)) = 1, moreover, h0,0 = 1, h1,0 = 0, h2,0 = 0, h3,0 = 0. cp cp = 2, points pj , 2 j k lie two dimensional face. using methods described above, nd (dpj , o(dpj )) = 0 = kb2 cp, h0,0 = 1, h1,0 = 1, h2,0 = 0, h3,0 = 0. 27 points p1 pk+1, get (dp1 , o(dp1)) = (dpk+1 , o(dpk+1)) = 1, h0,0 = 1, h1,0 = 0, h2,0 = 0, h3,0 = 0. thus see toric method yields results general agreement formulas (5.3), (5.4), (5.12) g(cp) = 0, since (toric) divisors cp toric variety b2 rational. another way compute arithmetic genus horizontal divisors use (d, o(d)) = 1/2kb3 d2 , expresses arithmetic genus vertical divisor fourfold terms image base b3, compute right hand side fan b3. illustrative example, explicitly compute arithmetic genera divisors calabiyau fourfold bered base shown g. 5(b). now, ray fan base corresponds divisor, canonical class k = idi. furthermore, three (distinct) divisors intersect form cone fan. thus, instance, d1 d2 d5 = 1, d5 d4 d6 = 0. addition, three linear relations among divisors imposed structure lattice. relations are: d2 = d4 d1 = nd2 + d7 + d3 + d8 + d9 (5.16) d5 + d7 = d8 + 2d9 + d6 fan g. 5(a), corresponding relations identical except absence terms involving d7, d8, d9, since divisors absent. case, recognize d5, d6 giving fan p 1 ber, d1, . . . , d4 giving fan fn, d2 = d4 = f , d1 = c, d3 = c0. (strictly speaking, d1 = p (c), on). fan g. 5(b) describes variety obtained blowing fn p 1 three times c0, zero section fn. simple computation, obtain following results: k d2 k d2 k d2 k d2 4 = 0 = 2f 2, 1 = 2n = 2c2 , 2 = k d2 7 = k d2 3 = k d2 9 = 2, 8 = 4 2n = 2kfn c0.
