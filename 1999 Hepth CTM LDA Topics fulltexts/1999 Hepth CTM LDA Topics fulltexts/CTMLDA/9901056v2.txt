abstract

we investigate the rotating d3-brane solution with maximum number of angular momen-
tum parameters. after determining the angular velocities, hawking temperature, adm
mass and entropy, we use this geometry to construct general three-parameter models of
non-supersymmetric pure su(n) yangmills theories in 2+1 dimensions. we calculate
glueball masses in the wkb approximation and obtain closed analytic expressions for
generic values of the parameters. we also determine the masses of kaluzaklein states
associated with internal parts of the ten-dimensional metric and investigate the param-
eter region where some of these states are decoupled. to leading order in 1/ and 1/n
(where  is the t hooft coupling) we nd a global u(1)3 symmetry and states with
masses comparable to glueball masses, which have no counterpart in the more familiar
(nite , n) yangmills theories.

1 introduction

the extremal d3-brane provides one of the simplest illustrations of the recently found
dualities between gauge theories and string theory on geometries which asymptotically
approach the anti-de sitter space-time [1]. because the string models on these geometries
are not understood to date, much of the attention has been devoted to those models where
the curvature of the geometry is small everywhere, so that the system can be studied by
using supergravity. this is the case for black brane geometries, which for large charges
have small curvatures everywhere outside the horizon. the most general geometry with a
regular horizon, which has a d3-brane charge, is given by the non-extremal d3-brane with
three angular momenta. it is of obvious interest to investigate the spectra of this general
(ve-parameter) supergravity model based on the d3-brane. in this paper we determine
the spectrum of the corresponding laplace operator in the wkb approximation.

models of qcd in 2 + 1 dimensions can be constructed from the non-extremal d3-
brane geometry by compactifying the euclidean time direction, which plays the role
of an internal angle [27].
in the case of zero angular momentum, there is a single
mass scale in the spectrum (given by the hawking temperature); kaluzaklein states
associated with the compact euclidean time have the same mass scale as the states
with vanishing kaluzaklein charge (e.g. glueballs) and the dimensional reduction is
not justied. this problem can be overcome by starting with a rotating d3-brane with
large angular-momentum, in which case the radius of the circle shrinks to zero and
the kaluzaklein particles decouple [5, 7]. another problem in making contact with
ordinary yangmills theory was pointed out in [8]. while the static d3-brane has an
so(6) isometry group associated with the ve-sphere part of the geometry, in pure non-
supersymmetric yangmills theory there is no counterpart of this so(6) global symmetry.
introducing angular momentum breaks the so(6) isometry group to smaller subgroups.
when the maximum number of angular momentum components are turned on, the only
remaining global symmetry is the abelian (cartan) subgroup u(1)  u(1)  u(1) of
so(6). although this is in a sense closer to qcd than a model based on the static d3-
brane (which implies a large so(6) global symmetry), there is no abelian u(1)3 global
symmetry in weakly coupled non-supersymmetric su(n) yangmills theory without
matter. a natural question is whether the kaluzaklein particles, which are charged
with respect to the u(1)3 cartan group, could have large masses (with respect to the
glueball masses) in some region of the three-dimensional parameter space a1, a2, a3.1 in
sect. 4.3 it will be shown that in the supergravity approximation these kaluzaklein
particles cannot decouple in any region of the parameter space a1, a2, a3. it should be
noted that the wkb approximation is sucient to establish that certain states do not
decouple, since one can consider in particular states with suciently high radial quantum
numbers so that the wkb approximation is close to the exact result. it is nevertheless

1there are two extra parameters associated with charge and mass of the d3-brane: the mass xes

the scale and can be set to 1; the charge is related to the t hooft coupling  and in the supergravity

approximation does not aect the mass spectra.

reasonable to expect that these exotic kaluzaklein particles may decouple once all 1/
eects are incorporated, since the weakly coupled non-supersymmetric yangmills theory
that should govern the low-energy dynamics of the compactied d3-brane does not have
these particles in the physical spectrum. a further discussion on this is given in sect. 5.

2 the rotating d3-brane background

the d3-brane has an internal so(6) rotational isometry, which allows three independent
angular parameters, l1, l2, l3. the metric for the case l2 = l3 = 0 was given in [5]. the
general metric with parameters l1, l2, l3 was recently given in an appendix in [9] and was
obtained by duality transformations of the black hole solutions of [10] (there are two
typographical errors in the expression of [9] that are corrected below). the rotating
d3-brane metric is given by

the dilaton eld  is constant, e = gs. the angular part diers from eq. (69) of
[9] in the components g and g. some interesting thermodynamical aspects of ro-
tating d3-branes have recently been investigated in refs. [11, 9, 12] in the context of
gauge/string-theory correspondence, which indicate that there may be a phase transition

2

in n = 4 super-yangmills theory at nite temperature [11, 12]. at zero temperature
the supergravity solution corresponds to the continuum limit [9, 13] of a multicenter
static d3-brane solution and describes a higgs phase of n = 4 super-yangmills theory
with a vacuum having a zn -type symmetry [13]. it would be interesting to extend these
discussions to the general case (1) of maximum number of angular momenta. the inter-
pretation is somewhat dierent in the present case, where (1) will be used to construct
a static space-time, with the euclidean time parametrizing an internal circle.

the parameters m and  are related to the d3-brane charge n by

sinh2  = q(2gsn2/m)2 + 1/4  1/2 .

which is a cubic equation for r2. the angular velocities 1, 2, 3 associated with

by evaluating 2 at dierent values of  and . at  = 0,  = 0, 2 is independent of
1,2, so that setting 2 = 0 determines 3. similarly, by evaluating 2 at  = 0,  = /2,
and using the value of 3 already obtained, one nds 2, whereas by evaluating it at
 = /2,  = /2 one obtains 1. the result can be written compactly as

3 wkb method

glueball masses in the models of [2, 5] have been calculated in the wkb approximation
in [14]. by extending the approach of [14], we develop in this section a simple formalism
that will be useful to calculate the dierent mass spectra (including kaluzaklein modes)
in the present case of three angular momenta.

we are interested in dierential equations of the form

u (f (u)u) +(cid:16)m 2h(u) + p(u)(cid:17)  = 0 ,

(12)

where m represents a mass parameter, and f (u), h(u) and p(u) are three arbitrary
functions that are independent of m and have the following behavior. there is a point
uh, where

f  f1(u  uh)s1 ,

h  h1(u  uh)s2 ,

p  p1(u  uh)s3 ,

as u  uh ,

(13)

for some constants s1, s2, s3, f1, h1 and p1. similarly, we assume that

f  f2ur1 ,

h  h2ur2 ,

p  p2ur3 ,

as u   ,

(14)

for some other constants r1, r2, r3, f2, h2 and p2. for large masses m, one may apply
wkb methods to obtain the approximate spectrum and expressions for . in order to
apply standard formulae from the wkb-approximation theory we cast (12) into the form
of a schrodinger equation

the necessary transformation that brings (12) into the form (15) is

y  + v (y) = 0 .

(19)

consistency requires that s2s1 + 2 and r1r22 are strictly positive numbers, whereas
s3  s1 + 2 and r1  r3  2 can be either positive or zero (see also below). from these
expressions we see that there are two turning points y1 and y2, given by solving v (y1) = 0
in (18) and v (y2) = 0 in (19). to the order of approximation that we will be interested
for the computation of m, we have

integrating y from  to +. one obtains

4 glueball masses in qcd3

the three-parameter qcd3 model is obtained from the rotating d3-brane metric (1)
in the following way. we rst go to euclidean space by letting t  i and li  ili,

we look for solutions of the form  = (u)eikx and identify the glueball mass square

for the various constants necessary for the application of the wkb method of sect. 3,
we nd

s1 = 1 ,

s2 = 0 ,

r1 = 3 ,

r2 = 0 ,

1 = 1 , 2 = 0 ,

1 = 1 ,

2 = 2 .

(40)

therefore (27) gives

the integral in (41) can be performed explicitly. let uh, u1 and u2 be the roots of f = 0.
one obtains

r2k(k)

[(uh  u1)(uh  u2)]1/4 ,

2[(uh  u1)(uh  u2)]1/2!1/2
where k(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the rst kind, i.e. k(k) = r /2

d1k2 sin2 
we may distinguish two cases, according to whether u1 and u2 are real or complex. in
the former case the above result can also be written as (uh > u1 > u2)

the validity of the wkb approximation requires that the conditions (28) be satised.
these imply

(44)

in the case of three real roots uh > u1 > u2, and u1 not too close to uh, k is always less
than 1, so that k(k) is of order 1, and (44) implies that the wkb approximation can
be applied. it breaks down when uh  u1. for the case of 1 real and 2 complex roots,
this happens if im u1  0 with uh  re u1 (or with uh < re u1, in which case k  1).
if c = a1a2a3 = 0 (say, a3 = 0), there are then three real roots  one of them being
u3 = 0 , since (~a2)2  4~b2 + 4u2
0  0. the situation is similar to the one-angular
momentum case discussed in [5, 7, 14]. the case a1 = a2, u0 = 0 is special. this gives a
double root with u1 = u2 = a2
1, so that s1 = 2, r1 = 3, s2 = r2 = 0 and s2s1 + 2 = 0 and
hence the wkb method breaks down (cf. eq. (19)). breaks down. the wkb method
breaks down also in the case a1 = a2 = a3  u0 (see also below).

the formula for the mass spectrum (41) for 0++ glueballs and its resonances implies
it
an important prediction for the ratio between masses of two arbitrary resonances:
is independent of ai (up to corrections of order 1/m2), depending only on the radial
quantum numbers

m =

m 2

m(m + 1)
m(m + 1)

.

(45)

this was observed in [14] for the case of qcd4 with one angular-momentum. it implies
that glueball masses with m  1 vary only slightly in the whole parameter space a1, a2, a3.

4.2 kaluzaklein modes with  dependence

for particles with u(1) charge associated with the circle parametrized by  one can check
that there exist simple (angular-independent) solutions of the form

in order to obtain qcd3 through a dimensional reduction of qcd4, it is necessary
that the mass scale for these kaluzaklein states be much larger than that for the glueball
masses. from eq. (50) one sees that this requires the condition

where k is given by (42). k(k) cannot be too large, otherwise the wkb approximation
breaks down (see (51)). therefore eq. (53) implies that in order to decouple the  kaluza
klein modes one needs that uh  u0. with no loss of generality we can assume that
a1  a2  a3. it is clear from the equation for the horizon that one has uh  u0 if and
only if uh  a2
1  u0.
to ensure at the same time the validity of the wkb approximation (51) one needs that
uh be not too close to u1, which for uh  u0 amounts to saying that a2
1 should not be
too close to a2
2.

1. thus the region where these kaluzaklein particles decouple is a2

4.3 kaluzaklein modes of s5

the isometry group of the metric with a1 = a2 = a3 = 0 contains a factor so(6). we will
investigate the problem of decoupling for the l = 1 kaluzaklein modes  corresponding
to the 6 representation of so(6) , as modes with larger value for l are expected to be
heavier. the three angular momenta break the symmetry down to the cartan subgroup
so(2)  so(2)  so(2). with respect to the cartan subgroup, the representation 6
decomposes into three doublets of so(2), i.e. 6  (2, 1, 1)  (1, 2, 1)  (1, 1, 2). these
give rise to three equations, which must be related by cyclic permutations of (a1, a2, a3).
for the rst doublet, we make the ansatz

sin 1 ! ,

(54)

and insert it into the laplace equation (37). one then obtains for (u) the dierential

when a2 = a3 = 0, the dierential equation reduces to eq. (3.15) of [7] (with u  u2).
for a1 = a3 = 0, it reduces to eq. (3.16) of [7], which corresponds to the other doublet
(this is because interchanging doublets is equivalent to permuting a1, a2, a3). for the
various constants of sect. 3 we nd

hence, using (28), we nd the mass

a1(uh  a2
uh(uh  u1)(uh  u2)! + o(m0) ,

2)(uh  a2

m  1 ,

(59)

where  is given by (42).

let us examine if these states may have a large mass in the same region a2

1  u0 where
the kaluzaklein modes with  dependence decouple. in this limit one has uh = a2
1,
u1 = a2

3, and the mass formula (59) takes the form

2, u2 = a2

m 2 

2
2 m(m + 3) + o(m0) ,
where  is again given by (42). this shows that for a2
1  u0 the mass of these kaluza
klein states is of the same order as the glueball masses (41). more generally, one can
show that in every region of the parameter space the kaluzaklein masses (59) are of

m  1 ,

(60)

order m = o(1/). indeed, it could only be otherwise in a region where uh = u1, where

11

the third term of (59) has a potential singularity, but this happens only in the region
a2
1  u0, which leads to (60).

for the ansatz

and for

 = (u)eikx cos  sin   cos 2

sin 2 ! ,

 = (u)eikx cos  cos   cos 3

sin 3 ! ,

(62)

corresponding to the other two doublets, we obtain the cyclic permutation in (a1, a2, a3) of
(56), as expected. note that the constants c0, . . . , c3 in (57) are not invariant under such
permutations. the constants of (58) are obtained by cyclic permutation in (a1, a2, a3) of
(58). for completeness we include the corresponding mass spectra. for the kaluzaklein
doublet (61) it is given by

m 2 =

2

2 m m + 2 +

a2(uh  a2
uh(uh  u1)(uh  u2)! + o(m0) ,

3)(uh  a2
1)

m  1 ,

(63)

and for the kaluzaklein doublet (62) it is given by

m 2 =

2

2 m m + 2 +

a3(uh  a2
uh(uh  u1)(uh  u2)! + o(m0) ,

1)(uh  a2
2)

m  1 ,

(64)

where  is given by (42) in both mass formulae. in the region a2
kaluzaklein states decouple, eqs. (63) and (64) take the form

1  u0 where the circle

m 2 

2
2 m(m + 2) + o(m0) ,

m  1 .

(65)

these are essentially the same mass formulae as in the case of the 0++ glueballs, so that
the corresponding mass scales are the same.

finally, we note that the conditions for the validity of the wkb approximation in
the case of the s5 kaluzaklein modes are roughly the same as the corresponding ones
for the 0++ glueballs we have already discussed. in all cases the wkb approximation
can be applied everywhere, except in the region a2

1 = a2

2  u0.

5 conclusions

in this paper we have considered non-supersymmetric qcd models in 2+1 dimensions
based on an asymptotically ads5 s5 static geometry constructed from the rotating d3-
brane with maximum number of rotation parameters. within the wkb approximation,
closed analytic formulas have been obtained for the mass spectra of 0++ scalar glueballs
and of states corresponding to excitations in the internal parts (circle and sphere) of the
space. the various mass spectra were found to depend, for every model and to the rst

12

two leading orders in the wkb approximation, in a universal manner on the rotation
parameters: modulo slight uctuations (such as the one produced by the third term in
(59)), only two mass scales appear, denoted 1/ and th, the latter characterizing the
masses of kaluzaklein particles associated with the  direction, the former dictating
the masses of all other scalar modes with vanishing charge in the  direction. this is a
bit surprising, and it implies that, despite the large number of parameters, the sphere
kaluzaklein modes  unlike the ones corresponding to the circle  do not decouple in
any region of parameter space. the sphere kaluzaklein states have no analogue at
the weakly coupled nite-n pure su(n) yangmills theories. masses computed in the
supergravity approximation can in principle get important corrections upon extrapolating
from the strong-coupling regime   1 to the weak-coupling regime   1. comparison
with lattice results [4, 7] suggests that singlet particles should only be slightly changed
in the extrapolation process, whereas non-singlet particles should get large corrections.

the extremal solution with u0 = 0 saturates the bogomolnyi bound and has unbroken
supersymmetries. the near-supersymmetric case a2
i  u0 is precisely the interesting
case where the radius of the extra brane direction shrinks to zero, so that the associated
kaluzaklein particles decouple and the system becomes eectively (2 + 1)-dimensional.
it would be very interesting to establish what are the states whose masses are protected
by supersymmetry in the rotating system with u0 = 0. this might explain why glueball
masses have values close to the values obtained by lattice calculations [7, 15].
