abstract

using ads/cft correspondence we found the conformal anomaly from d3
and d5 gauged supergravity with single scalar (dilaton) and the arbitrary
scalar potential on ads-like scalar-gravitational background. such dilatonic
gravity action describes the special rg ows in extended gauged sg when
scalars lie in one-dimensional submanifold of complete scalars space. this
dilaton-dependent conformal anomaly corresponds to dual non-conformal
(gauge) qft with account of radiative corrections and (or) masses. the
attempt to dene c-function away of conformity is presented.

five-dimensional gauged supergravity (sg) plays an important role in
ads/cft correspondence[1]. it is known that dierent versions of d5 gauged
sg (for example, n = 8 d5 gauged sg[2] with fourty-two scalars and non-
trivial scalar potential) may appear as a result of truncation of d10 iib sg.
in particular, ads5  s5 deformed truncation of iib sg (with non-trivial
scalars) corresponds to some specic solution of d5 gauged sg. hence, it is
often enough to study 5d gauged sg classical solutions in ads/cft set-up
instead of the investigation of non-linear iib sg solutions. such (deformed)
solutions describe rg ows in dual boundary eld theory (for a very re-
cent discussion of such ows, see [16, 3, 4] and refs.
it is very
interesting that even 4d curvature or non-zero temperature eects may be
taken into account in bulk description of such rg ows [5].
in consider-
ation of extended d5 gauged sg solutions there are often more symmetric
(special) rg ows where scalars lie in one-dimensional submanifold of com-
plete scalars space. (then such theory corresponds to d5 dilatonic gravity
with non-trivial dilaton potential). such ows may also correspond to cer-
tain (d3)-brane distributions [6]. however, note that it is extremely dicult
to make the explicit identication of deformed gauged sg solution with the
corresponding non-conformal dual gauge theory.

therein).

the important characteristic of boundary (gauge) theory in ads/cft
correspondence is the conformal anomaly which may be found from the bulk
side (see paper by witten in ref.[1]). the calculation of conformal anomaly
in d5 gauged sg with single scalar and constant scalar potential (dilatonic
gravity) on dilaton-gravitational background via ads/cft correspondence
has been initiated in ref.[12]. it was shown that n = 4 super ym theory co-
variantly coupled with n = 4 conformal sg [7] is actual dual of d5 dilatonic
gravity (see also derivation of anomaly in gravity-complex scalar background
in refs.[8, 13]). from holographic rg description (see refs.[9, 10] for intro-
duction) it is known that dilaton (or in more general case, scalars) describe
the couplings of dual (gauge) theory, say, masses, scalars or coupling con-
stants. hence, it is extremely interesting to get the conformal anomaly for
gauged sg with non-trivial scalar potential. this may give much better un-
derstanding of rg ows in dual (non-conformal) boundary theory and also
the denition of analog of central charge (c-function) away of conformity.
even more, considering the conformal anomaly of dual general boundary
theory with radiative corrections and comparing it with the one from bulk
gauged sg may help in correct identication of dual boundary theory with

2

correspondent bulk identication (which is currently non-easy task). note
also that conformal anomaly plays an important role in the construction of
local surface counterterm for gauged sgs with non-constant scalar potential
[14].

in the present letter we nd the ads/cft conformal anomaly from d3
and d5 gauged sg with single scalar (dilaton) and arbitrary dilaton poten-
tial. this situation corresponds to special rg ow in dual description. the
candidates for analogs of central charge (or more exactly, of c-function) away
of conformity are presented. we believe that even for non-conformal theory
this analogous c-function may be of importance as it measures the dilatonic
deviation from conformity. the numerical study of c-function for two ex-
plicit choices of dilaton potential indicates to non-monotonic behaviour as
expected.

we start with the bulk action of d + 1-dimensional dilatonic gravity with

the potential 

s =

16g zmd+1

dd+1xq gn r + x()( )2 + y ()  + () + 42o .

(1)
here md+1 is d+1 dimensional manifold whose boundary is the d dimensional
manifold md and we choose (0) = 0. such action corresponds to (bosonic
sector) of gauged sg with single scalar (special rg ow). note also that
classical vacuum stability restricts the form of dilaton potential [15]. as
well-known, we also need to add the surface terms [11] to the bulk action
in order that the variational principle to be well-dened. we should only
note here that the surface terms become irrelevant nally in the calculation
for the weyl anomaly given in this work. the equations of motion given by
variation of (1) with respect to  and g are

following form

gij = 1gij .

(5)

here l is related with 2 by 42 = d(d  1)/l2. if gij = ij, the boundary
of ads lies at  = 0. note that we follow the method of calculation in
refs.[12, 13] where dilatonic gravity with constant dilaton potential has been
considered.

the action (1) diverges in general since the action contains the innite
volume integration on md+1. the action is regularized by introducing the
infrared cuto  and replacing

z dd+1x  z ddxz

d , zmd

ddx(cid:16)  (cid:17)  z ddx (cid:16)  (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=

the subtraction of the terms proportional to the inverse power of  does
not break the invariance under the scale transformation g = 2g and
 = 2 . when d is even, however, the term proportional to ln  appears.
this term is not invariant under the scale transformation and the subtraction
of the ln  term breaks the invariance. the variation of the ln  term under
the scale transformation is nite when   0 and should be canceled by the
variation of the nite term (which does not depend on ) in the action since
the original action (1) is invariant under the scale transformation. therefore
the ln  term sln gives the weyl anomaly t of the action renormalized by the
subtraction of the terms which diverge when   0 (d=4)

sln =

2 z d4xgt .

first we consider the case of d = 2, i.e. three-dimensional gauged sg.

the anomaly term sln proportional to ln in the action is

for () = 0 case, the central charge of the conformal eld theory is given
by the coecient of r. then it might be natural to introduce the analog of
central charge c, i.e. c-function for the case when the conformal symmetry
is broken by the deformation as follows :

comparing this with radiatively-corrected central charge of boundary qft
may help in correct bulk description of such theory.

then we can get the anomaly terms (13) in terms of g(0)ij and (0), which
are boundary values of metric and dilaton respectively by using (14), (15),
(16), (17). as we are only interested in c-function away from conformity, we
present the coecients of r2
(0), which appear in weyl anomaly
(11). for this reason, we neglect the terms containing the derivative with
respect to xi. here we choose l = 1 and denote ((0)) by  and abbreviate
the index (0) for the simplicity.

here  can be regarded as dilaton. when  is not trivial, of course, there
appear extra terms which are denoted by    in (22). when  is not triv-

becomes dilaton de-

and we can nd that the standard result (conformal anomaly of n = 4 super
ym theory) is reproduced. in order that the region near the boundary at
 = 0 is asymptotically ads, we need to require   0 and   0 when
  0. we can also conrm that h  1

and   0 even if  6= 0 and  6= 0. in the ads/cft correspondence, k
and h should be related with the central charge c of the conformal eld theory

24 and k   1

10

(or its analog for non-conformal theory). since we have two functions h and
k, there are two natural ways to dene the c-function when the conformal
eld theory is deformed:

have chosen l = 1 in the expressions in (27). we can restore l-dependence
by changing h  l3h and k  l3k and   l,   l2 and   l3
in (22). then in the limit of   0, we obtain

which agrees with the denition used in the works [17, 18] in above limit.
the c1- or c2-functions in (27) give the new candidate for c-function away of
conformity.

we now consider some examples. in [6] and [16], the following dilaton

potentials appeared:

in both cases v is a constant and v = 2.
in the classical solutions for
the both cases,  is the monotonically decreasing function of the energy
scale (  1
2 ) and  = 0 at the uv limit corresponding to the boundary
and   + in the uv limit. then in order to know the energy scale
dependences of c1 and c2, we only need to investigate the  dependences of
h and k in (22). by the numerical calculations, their behaviors are given in
gures, where  (horizontal axis) versus h and k (vertical axis) for fgpw
are given in figs.1 and 2 and those for gppz are in figs.3 and 4. in any
case, h and k are increasing functions when  is small as expected but the
monotonities are broken when  is not small. that proves that such bulk
regime corresponds to non-conformal boundary gauge theory. furhtermore

11

there appear singularities coming from 0  2 2 + (24 + )  which are
included in the denominators in h and k. in h for fgpw, there also appears
a singularities coming from 0  2 2 + (18 + ) ( + 8 v ), which is also
included in the denominator of h. hence, our candidate c-functions may be
seriously considered as realistic ones only in the region with small dilaton.

in summary, we found the conformal anomaly from d3 and d5 gauged
supergravity with single scalar and arbitrary scalar potential on the scalar-
gravitational background. it corresponds to the conformal anomaly of dual
boundary theory. the attempt to dene c-function away of conformity is also
presented. our work may be extended for d5 gauged sg with bigger number
of scalars (say n = 8 gauged sg) and arbitrary scalar potential. the nal
result appears in really complicated and lengthy form as it will be shown in
another place. this opens the possibility of explicit check if the results on
rg ows in dual gauge theory (deformed n = 4 super yang-mills) presented
in refs.[4, 16] from bulk side indeed describe 4d gauge yang-mills theory with
lesser supersymmetry and the correspondent identication is correct. from
another side, our conformal anomaly in the spirit of ref.[19] may be used
to calculate the casimir energy in dilatonic gravity. as the nal remark let
us note that dilaton-dependent conformal anomaly found in this work may
be used for calculation of anomaly induced eective action of non-conformal
boundary qft in the presence of scalars (see ref.[20] for related example of
dilaton dependent induced eective action in susy yang-mills theory).
