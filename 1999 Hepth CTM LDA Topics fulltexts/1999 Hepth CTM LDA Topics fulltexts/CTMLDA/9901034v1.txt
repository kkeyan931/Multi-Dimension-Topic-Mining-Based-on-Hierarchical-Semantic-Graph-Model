abstract

recently, it was shown by jevicki, kazama and yoneya (jky) that the super-
yang-mills theories (sym) in d  4 can reproduce the conformal symmetry of
the near-horizon geometry of the d-brane solutions. however, the eikonal approx-
imation they used is not sucient for analyzing the conformal symmetry in sym.
we carry out the 1-loop calculation beyond the eikonal approximation for d = 1
sym (i.e., matrix model) to conrm the claim of jky.

1 introduction

the duality between string theory on the anti-de-sitter (ads) space and the conformal eld
theory on its boundary has been investigated intensively [1, 2]. recently, an interesting obser-
vation was made by jevicki, kazama and yoneya (jky) [3] that the isometry of the ads space
can be derived from d = 4 n = 4 super-yang-mills theory (sym). the special conformal
transformation (sct) in sym is modied by a quantum extra term to reproduce the isometry
of the ads space.

although the near-horizon geometry of the dp-brane solution with p 6= 3 is not of the ads
type, sct as well as the dilatation symmetry1 of the near-horizon geometry play important
roles in determining the form of the born-infeld action of the dp-brane [1, 5]. the sct of
the near-horizon geometry diers from that in sym by a u (radial coordinate) dependent
term which vanishes on the boundary u  . jky [4] generalized the arguments of [3] to
the p 6= 3 case to show that this u-dependent term can be reproduced from the extra term
in the sct of sym which we have to add for compensating the breaking of sct due to the
gauge-xing term.

in [4], they calculated the sct and the 1-loop eective action using the eikonal approx-
imation and examined the sct ward identity in sym, in particular for the d = 1 case.
however, the eikonal approximation is in fact insucient for determining the eective action
and examining the sct ward identity. this is because the higher derivative terms of the
scalar elds (transverse coordinates of the d-brane), which vanish in the eikonal approxima-
tion, are converted into terms containing only the rst derivative of the scalars through the
integration by parts.

the purpose of this note is to carry out the 1-loop calculation beyond the eikonal ap-
proximation for d = 1 sym (i.e., matrix model [6]). we determine completely the form of
the 1-loop eective action with a particular operator dimension and conrm the sct ward
identity.

2 sct in matrix model

first, let us briey summarize the sct in matrix model [5, 3, 4]. it is well known that the
action of d = 4 n = 4 sym has conformal symmetry. this is also the case for maximally
sym in other dimensions if we assign the coupling constant a conformal dimension and vary it

1 the sct and the dilatation symmetry in both the near-horizon geometry with p 6= 3 and the sym with

d 6= 4 are generalized ones in the sense that they transform also the coupling constants [4].

under the transformation. we will here concentrate on the d = 1 sym case (in the euclidean
formulation):

ssym =z d tr  1

2gs

(dxm)2 

1
4gs

[xm, xn]2 

1
2

t d 

1
2

t m[xm, ]! .

(1)

this is the action of d-particles and is familiar in the matrix model. the action (1) is
invariant under both the dilatation and sct. in particular, the transformation law of the
bosonic variables under sct reads

 =  2,

(a, xm) = 2 (a, xm),

gs = 6 gs.

(2)

in order to quantize the system, we have to add the gauge-xing and the corresponding ghost
terms to the original action (1):

tr g2,

sgf =z d
sgh = iz d tr(cid:16) cdc  c[bm, [xm, c]](cid:17) .

g = a + i[bm, ym],

2gs

here we have adopted the background gauge, and ym is the uctuation of the scalars xm from
the diagonal background bm; xm = bm + ym. while sgf + sgh (3) is dilatation invariant, it
is not invariant under sct (2). however, the sct symmetry is restored by applying a brst
transformation, brstxm = i[xm, c], etc. with a eld dependent transformation parameter
,

 = 2iz d tr(cid:16) c( )a( ) (cid:17) .

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

in fact, the violation of sct, (sgf + sgh), is canceled by the change of the functional measures
of a and c under brst. therefore, the eective action [b, gs] of the present system satises
the following sct ward identity,

where the extra term bm,i for bm = diag (bm,i) is



gs( )

+ ( + )bm,i( )

z d gs( )
bm,i( ) = 2(cid:28)[c( ), xm( )]iiz d0 tr( c(0)a(0) )(cid:29) .

bm,i( )! [b, gs] = 0,



note that the total sct for bm is now given as a sum of the classical part bm,i = 2 bm,i
and the quantum correction bm,i.

in the following sections, we shall rst calculate explicitly [b, gs] and bm,i within the
eikonal approximation and nd that the eikonal approximation is insucient for conrm-
ing the sct ward identity (5). we then present a systematic analysis beyond the eikonal
approximation by incorporating the acceleration and the higher time derivative terms.

2

3 eikonal approximation

in this section we shall repeat the calculation of [b, gs] and bm,i in the eikonal approx-
imation given in [4] in a more systematic manner to clarify the problem. before carrying
out the calculation, let us recall the structure of the double expansion in the matrix model.
according to [7], calculations in the matrix model has the structure of the double expansion
with respect to [l3] and [l2t2], where [l] represents the length dimension, and [t] the
time dimension of the operators. the expansion with respect to [l3] corresponds to the loop
expansion, while [l2t2] is the unit dimension of the time derivative expansion. therefore,
the n-loop eective action n-loop has the following structure:

0-loop = [l2t2] + [l0t4] + [l2t6] +   
1-loop = [l1t2] + [l3t4] + [l5t6] +   
2-loop = [l4t2] + [l6t4] + [l8t6] +   

...

(7)

here we are interested in the [l2t2] term of 0-loop, and the [l1t2] and [l3t4] terms of
1-loop.

for the 1-loop calculation we need the quadratic part of the matrix model action. as
stressed in [4], it is necessary to take into account the fact that the coupling constant gs is
now a function of  and to keep the dependence linear in   gs/gs:

ym,ij(2 +  + b2

first, the 1-loop eective action is given by

1-loop = trn10 ln(cid:16)2 +  + b2(cid:17) + ln(1  4vm()vm())

4 ln(cid:16)2 + b2 + b(cid:17)  4 ln(cid:16)2 + b2  b(cid:17)  2 ln(cid:16)2 + b2(cid:17)o,

with b  q( bm)2. here, we are considering the two-body case with (bm,1, bm,2) = (0, bm),

and the propagator () is given by ()  (2 +  + b2)
contribution of ly y and laa, the second term is due to the mixing between ym and a, the
third and the fourth terms are from l, and the last term is the ghost loop.

expanding (15) to o(), we nd that the 1-loop eective action is given as a sum of the

following three terms, 1-loop = 1 + 1 + g1:

1 = trnln(cid:16)1  4 b b(cid:17)  4 ln(cid:16)1  b b(cid:17)o ,

(20)

the following useful convolution formula holds for d(1, 2; s):

g(1, 2; s1, s2; j) z d0 d(1, 0; s1) ej 0 d(0, 2; s2)
= d(1, 2; s1 + s2) exp( j (1 sinh 2s2v + 2 sinh 2s1v) + j 2 sinh 2s1v sinh 2s2v/2v

sinh 2(s1 + s2)v

(23)

using the above formulas, the 1-loop eective action in the eikonal approximation can be
calculated exactly to any desired order in the time derivative expansion (see the remarks below
eq. (33)). keeping the terms with dimensions [l1t2] and [l3t4] as we mentioned at the
beginning of this section, we have

note that the eective action should be a functional of bm( ) and gs( ) as is seen from
the original expression (15). then, our next task is to rewrite (24) in terms of bm( ) and its
derivatives. in the eikonal approximation with b = 0, there are the following candidate terms
with suitable dimensions for expressing the above eective actions:

having nished the calculation of the eective action, let us proceed to bm. reviving

temporarily the indices (i, j) of the elds, eq. (6) at the 1-loop order is given by

bm,i( ) = 2z d0(cid:16)hcij( ) cji(0)i hym,ji( )aij(0) i  (i  j)(cid:17) ,

where the free propagators are

hcij(1) cij(2)i = i h1| ij |2i ,

(32)

where the nal expression is obtained by using the formulas (20)(23). expressing again (32)

in terms of bm, we obtain the nal form of the quantum sct e   + :

although the coecient 3/2 of the last term of ebm is apparently dierent from that of the

u-dependent term in the sct of the near-horizon geometry, the two sct are related by a
coordinate transformation [4].

let us give remarks on the systematic expansion in powers of [l2t2]. we shall explain

the following two points:

1. how to obtain the expressions like eqs. (24) and (32), which have the powers of  (but

not b) as their denominators.

2. note that the quantity v2 2/2 is dimensionless. hence, one might think that, for the
terms with a given dimension, an innite series in powers of v2 2/2 appears in the
eective action and bm. on the other hand, if these quantities can be expressed in
terms of bm and its derivatives, we should have only a nite number of terms with a
given dimension. we shall explain why in the concrete calculations the series in powers
of v2 2/2 terminate at a nite order.

to explain the rst point, note that 1-loop and bm such as the second terms of (24) and
(32) are given, after using the convolution formulas (22) and (23), by the following generic
form:

myk=1z 

0

dsk f (s1v,    , sm v)d(,  ;xk

sk) eb2pk sk,

(34)

in terms of some function f (skv). the expansion in powers of 1/ (but not 1/b) is obtained
by rewriting the last two factors in (34) as

d(,  ; s) eb2s =r

v

2 sinh 2sv

exp(cid:16)v 2 [tanh sv  sv](cid:17) e2s,

and taylor-expanding the integrands in (34) other than e2pk sk with respect to v.

(37)

(38)

the second point that the series in powers of v2 2/2 terminates at a nite order is easily

understood from the series expansion,

exp(cid:16)v 2 [tanh sv  sv](cid:17) =

xm=0

mxn=0

cm,n(sv)2m(sv2 2)n.

(36)

an important point is that for a given m, which species the dimension of the term in units
of [l1t1], the summation over n terminates at n = m.

let us return to the results (27), (28) and (33) in the eikonal approximation and examine
whether the sct ward identity (5) holds. first, the eective action 0 at the tree level is
given by

and it is transformed under sct of (33) as

up to a total derivative term. the claim of [4] is that the 1-loop eective action 1 + 1 is
given by

(1 + 1)jky =z d(

15
16

( b2)2

b7 + ( ) 3

2

b  b

!) .

(39)

then, since we have e = 6 + o(), putting  = 0 after the transformation and discarding

the total derivative term (3/2)( b  b)/b3, we have

e (1 + 1)jky =z d 

15
4

 b2( b  b)

b7

! ,

(40)

which just cancels (38). however, our 1 (28) does not agree with the  term in (39).

in the above argument, we have implicitly assumed that the expressions (27), (28) and
(33) are valid for a generic bm( ) not restricted to the eikonal form (19) although they are
obtained using the eikonal approximation. however, if, for example, we added to (28) the term
(15/8)( b  b)( b  b)/b7, which vanishes in the eikonal approximation, the sum of the last
two terms in (28) and the added one would become (15/8) b2( b  b)/b7 + (15/16)(d/d )[( b 
b)2/b7] with the desired coecient 15/8. on the other hand, if we further added (3/4)( b 
b)/b5 to the above quantity, the sum would become a purely total derivative term. therefore,
for examining the sct ward identity, we have to go beyond the eikonal approximation. this
is the subject of the next section.

7

4 beyond the eikonal approximation

before carrying out the calculation beyond the eikonal approximation, let us list the terms we
have to consider in the 1-loop eective action 1-loop and the quantum sct bm. first, for
bm/b5 is the unique function of bm with dimension [l4t1]. therefore, the quantum
bm,
sct (33) is already valid beyond the eikonal approximation. next, let us consider the terms
proportional to  in 1-loop (they are contained in g1 as well as in 1). we are interested in
those terms with dimensions [l1t1] and [l3t3] excluding . for [l1t1], there is only
one term b  b/b3. as for the terms with dimension [l3t3], we have
b/b5
and ( b  b)( b  b)/b7, besides the terms b2( b  b)/b7 and ( b  b)3/b9 which we have already
taken into account in the eikonal approximation. for the -independent terms in 1-loop, there
are in total 11 kinds of terms although we do not list them explicitly. our task in this section
is to determine the coecients of all of these terms to examine the sct ward identity.

and keep terms up to linear in a  b, a  v and w  b in 1-loop. these three kinds of terms are

with g of (22). in (44), we rst applied (23) to 2
0, and then replaced 0 arising from the 0-
derivative acting on d(0,  ; s3) with h1. finally, we have to taylor-expand (44) with respect
to v using the expression (35) and carry out the sk integrations.

this has the desired coecient 15/8 and agrees essentially with the claim (39) of [4], implying
that the sct ward identity is in fact satised.

5 conclusion

in this paper we calculated the 1-loop eective action in matrix model beyond the eikonal
approximation and conrmed the sct ward identity. eikonal approximation can only give
limited information on the eective action. it is crucial to consider a higher polynomial form
for bm( ) for determining completely the eective action, especially, its -dependent terms.
we nish this paper by giving some comments.

 in our calculation, it is important to take into account the contribution of g1 (18), which
vanishes in the eikonal approximation and hence is usually dropped from the start.

 by applying our method of calculation, it is possible to determine also the higher order terms
with dimensions [l5t6], [l7t8], . . ., in the derivative expansion of the eective action (cf.
eq. (7)).

 in this paper we examined the sct ward identity (5) at the lowest order in . by keeping
terms with higher powers of , the sct ward identity is expected to hold without putting
 = 0 after the transformation.
