abstract

we study compactications of type iib supergravity on calabi-yau threefolds. the
resulting low energy eective lagrangian is displayed in the large volume limit and its
symmetry properties  with specic emphasis on the sl(2, z)  are discussed. the
explicit map to type iia string theory compactied on a mirror calabi-yau is derived.
we argue that strong coupling eects on the worldsheet break the sl(2, z).

1 introduction

compactications of string theories on 6-dimensional calabi-yau manifolds result in
string vacua with four at minkowskian dimensions (d = 4) and, depending on the type
of calabi-yau manifold, a xed number of preserved supercharges. specically, string
vacua with n = 2 supersymmetry in d = 4 are obtained by compactifying type ii strings
on calabiyau threefolds y3, the heterotic string on k3  t 2 or the type i string on
k3 t 2. it is believed that all of the resulting string vacua are perturbative descriptions
of dierent regions in one and the same moduli space [1, 2]. in this paper we conne our
attention to the region of the moduli space where type ii string compactications are the
appropriate perturbative theories.

in d = 10 type ii string theories come in two dierent versions, the non-chiral type iia
and the chiral type iib string theory but upon compactication on calabi-yau threefolds
they are related by mirror symmetry. more precisely, type iib compactied on y3 is
equivalent to iia compactied on the mirror manifold y3 [3, 4]. due to this equivalence
one has the choice to study either compactication but since there is no simple covariant
action of type iib supergravity in d = 10 [5] type iia compactications appear to be
easier [6]. in terms of the underlying conformal eld theory the two theories in d = 4
only dier by the gso-projection and thus can be discussed on the same footing [3, 4].
however, it is believed that the type iib theory in d = 10 has an exact non-perturbative
sl(2, z) symmetry [7] which is not shared by type iia (in d = 10). thus, it is of
interest to study the fate of this sl(2, z) symmetry upon compactication to d = 4
[8] and this is one of the goals of this paper. for that reason we focus on geometrical
compactications (and not the conformal eld theory versions) of the eective type iib
theory for most parts of this paper. in addition, the general type iib eective lagrangian
and the explicit map to the type iia vacua has only been given in a special case [9, 10]
and as a byproduct we close this gap.

this paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we recall some of the properties
in section 3 we discuss the compactication on
of type iib supergravity in d = 10.
calabi-yau threefolds and display the four-dimensional low energy eective action in
the large volume limit. apart from the gravitational multiplet one nds h(1,1) tensor
multiplets, h(1,2) vector multiplets and one double-tensor multiplet. we concentrate
on the couplings of the tensor multiplets since the couplings of the vector multiplets have
been given before [11, 4, 12]. in addition the sl(2, z)  inherited from the d = 10 theory
 acts on the tensor multiplets while the vector multiplets are left invariant. in section 4
the explicit map between type iib compactied on y3 and type iia compactied on the
mirror manifold y3 is displayed. this map enables us to also discuss the geometry of
the tensor multiplets in terms of a holomorphic prepotential and obtain the worldsheet
instanton corrections. we nd that the sl(2, z) is manifest at the string tree level in the
large volume limit of the compactication but broken once strong coupling eects on the
worldsheet (worldsheet instantons) are taken into account. furthermore, the sl(2, z) is
also present in the large complex structure limit of type iia vacua but rather obscure in
the standard eld variables. section 5 contains our conclusions and some of the technical
aspects of this paper are collected in an appendix.

2 type iib supergravity in d = 10

the bosonic massless modes of the type iib string are the graviton gm n (m, n =
0, . . . , 9), a doublet of antisymmetric tensors bi
m n (i = 1, 2), two real scalar elds , l
and a 4-form dm n p q with a self-dual eld strength. gm n , b1
m n and  arise in the ns-ns
sector while b2
m n , l and dm n p q reside in the r-r sector;  is the dilaton of type iib
string theory.

the diculty of constructing a covariant low energy eective action for these massless
modes is due to the presence of the self-dual 5-form eld strength. the eld equations
of type iib supergravity on the other hand are well known [5]. however, if one does not
impose the self-duality condition a covariant action (in the einstein frame) can be given

in eq. (1) we suppress space-time indices; in particular, the topological term d h i  h j
is contracted with the ten-dimensional -tensor while all other terms are contracted with
the ten-dimensional metric. finally, we choose 12 = +1. the type iib supergravity is
obtained as the euler-lagrange equations of the action (1) together with the self-duality
condition

this theory has a number of symmetries. first of all there are the gauge transforma-

tions of the 4-form (with parameters n p q)

dm n p q = [m n p q],

under which all other elds are invariant. secondly, there are the gauge transformations

instead.

3 calabi-yau compactications of type iib super-

gravity

3.1 the spectrum

let us now study the compactication of the type iib low energy eective theory on
calabi-yau threefolds y3. the resulting theory in d = 4 has n = 2 supersymmetry and
the low energy spectrum comes in appropriate n = 2 supermultiplets. more specically
one nds that the 10-dimensional metric gm n decomposes into the 4-dimensional metric
g (,  = 0, . . . , 3), 2  h(1,2) deformations of the complex structure g, g   (,  =
1, 2, 3) and h(1,1) deformations of the kahler class g . the hodge numbers h(1,1)(h(1,2))
count the harmonic (1, 1)-forms ((1, 2)-forms) on y3. the antisymmetric tensors bi
m n
decompose into a doublet of antisymmetric tensors bi
 and 2  h(1,1) scalar modes bi
 .
finally the 4-form decomposes into h(1,1) (real) antisymmetric tensors d  and h(1,2) +1
real vectors d,d.4 together with the two scalars  and l these elds assemble
into the following n = 2 supermultiplets:

double  tensor multiplet
h(1,2) vector multiplets
h(1,1) tensor multiplets

 , , l) ,

(g,d) ,
(bi
(d, g, g  ) ,
(d , g , bi
 ) ,

where we only display the bosonic components. the gravitational multiplet contains 2
gravitini while all the other multiplets contain two weyl fermions.5 in d = 4 an antisym-
metric tensor describes one physical degree of freedom and thus can always be dualized
to a scalar. at the level of supermultiplets this duality relates both the tensor and the
double-tensor multiplet to a hypermultiplet which contains four real scalar degrees of

3in fact at the classical level one has the larger group sl(2, r) which is broken by quantum corrections

to sl(2, z).

freedom. in this dual basis the low energy spectrum features h(1,1) + 1 hypermultiplets
and h(1,2) vector multiplets apart from the gravitational multiplet.

the couplings of the vector multiplets have been obtained before [11, 4, 12] and thus
we exclusively focus on the couplings of the h(1,1) tensor and the universal double-tensor
multiplet. (or in other words we consider calabi-yau threefolds with h(1,2) = 0.) on a
calabi-yau threefold the kahler deformations of the metric can be expanded in terms of
harmonic (1, 1)-forms a

  according to

g  = va(x) a
d  = da

  ,

a = 1, . . . , h(1,1) .

(9)

in terms of these variables the tensor multiplets consist of ( da

 , va, bia).

before we display the four-dimensional lagrangian let us collect a few more properties

of calabi-yau threefolds [15, 16]. the kahler form j is dened as

 ,
j = ig  d  d 

(10)

where the  are the complex coordinates on y3. the volume v can be expressed in
terms of j according to

v = iz gd6 =

(14)

3.2 the lagrangian

the next step is the construction of the dimensionally reduced type iib low energy eec-
tive theory. we follow the procedure outlined in refs. [13] and reduce the 10-dimensional
action (1) imposing the self-duality condition on the eld equations by hand. the re-
sulting eld equations in d = 4 can be shown to be the euler-lagrange equations of a

furthermore, the kinetic terms for the (1, 1)-moduli va and the dilaton decoupled due to
the denition of the four-dimensional dilaton [12]

and rotated moduli elds

e24 = v (v) e2 ,

va = vae/2 .

(17)

(18)

note that (14) and (15) are only valid in the limit where the 10-dimensional theory is a
good approximation, i.e. when v is large. this limit is termed the large volume limit
but generically subleading () corrections are also important. these are briey discussed
in section 4.3.

as we already discussed an antisymmetric tensor in four spacetime dimensions is dual
to a scalar and so we can dualize the h(1,1) + 2 antisymmetric tensor elds da
 in
the action (15). this is done most conveniently by adding h(1,1) + 2 lagrange multipliers
ga, hi to the lagrangian

l = l + ih i

(19)

 can then be used to eliminate

the (algebraic) equations of motion of l for f a
these elds in favour of the scalars ga and hi. the resulting lagrangian reads

3.3 symmetry properties

the symmetries of the 10-dimensional theory discussed in section 2 are also manifest
in d = 4. the action (15) is invariant under h(1,1) + 2 gauge transformations (with
parameters a

) of the antisymmetric tensors

, i

da

bi

(21)

in addition we have 2h(1,1) continuous peccei-quinn (pq) symmetries (with parameters
cia) acting on the scalar elds bia and the antisymmetric tensors da


bia = cia ,

da

 = ij ciabj

 .

(22)

these symmetries are inherited from the ten-dimensional symmetries (4), (5). note
that in the dual basis the gauge transformations (21) manifest themselves as h(1,1) + 2
additional continuous pq symmetries (with parameters ca, ci)

ga = ca ,

hi = ci ,

while (22) transmogries into

ga =

(24)

one of the distinct features of the type iib theory in d = 10 is its sl(2, z) invariance
(6)-(8). this symmetry is of importance since it includes a strong-weak coupling duality
as one of its generators. thus it is of interest to study the fate of this symmetry in the
d = 4 action. since eq. (15) was obtained as a straight dimensional reduction of the
action (1) the sl(2, z) will also be manifest in (15) but due to the eld redenitions
(17), (18) it also acts on the calabi-yau moduli va and altogether becomes more involved.
more precisely, using (6)-(8), (17) and (18), one nds

while the da

(27)

it can be explicitly checked that the lagrangian (15) is invariant under the transforma-
tions specied in (25) and (26) and thus at the string tree level and in the large volume
limit the sl(2, z) is present in d = 4 [8].

4 the map between iia and iib

4.1 preliminaries

type iia string theory compactied on calabi-yau threefolds features h(1,1) vector mul-
tiplets, h(1,2) hypermultiplets and one tensor multiplet in its low energy spectrum. the
tensor multiplet can be dualized to an additional hypermultiplet. a type iib compact-
ication on y3 is equivalent to a type iia compactication on the mirror manifold y3
once the appropriate (worldsheet) quantum corrections are taken into account. this
equivalence is a property of the underlying conformal eld theory [17] but has also been
demonstrated for the geometrical compactications on calabi-yau manifolds [18]. on
the mirror manifold the hodge numbers are reversed and one has

h(1,1)(y3) = h(1,2)( y3) ,

h(1,2)(y3) = h(1,1)( y3) .

(28)

the low energy spectrum of the two theories is most easily compared in the dual basis
where the h(1,1) +1 hypermultiplets of iib are identied with the h(1,2) +1 hypermultiplets
of type iia. the purpose of this section is to explicitly display the map between the eld
variables of type iib and type iia. for h(1,1)(y3) = 1 this map was given in ref. [9].

let us start by recalling the low energy eective action of type iia. the universal
hypermultiplet of iia which is the dual of the tensor multiplet contains the dilaton
a, the dual  of an antisymmetric tensor and two scalars  0,  0 from the r-r sector.
the scalars of the remaining h(1,2) hypermultiplets are denoted by za, za,  a,  a where
a = 1, . . . , h(1,2).6 the za, za arise from the ns-ns sector while the  a,  a come from the
r-r sector. the tree level lagrangian for these hypermultiplets is known to be [19, 12]

where i, j, k, l = 0, . . . , h(1,2). the scalar manifold spanned by the 4  (h(1,2) + 1) scalars
is constrained by n = 2 supergravity to be a quaternionic manifold [20] and this has
been explicitly veried for (29) in ref. [19]. however, this scalar manifold is not the most
general quaternionic manifold but at the string tree level further constrained by the c-
map [4]. that is, the submanifold spanned by the deformations of the complex structure
za has to be a special kahler manifold [11].7 more precisely, the metric gab(z, z) is kahler
and furthermore determined by a holomorphic prepotential f (x) which is a homogenous
function of degree two (f (x) = 2f (x)). specically, one has

gab =


za


 zb

k ,

(30)

6here we use a slightly inconsistent notation since we reserved the index a to label (1, 1)-forms.
however, we are anticipating the mirror map between type iia and type iib which identies the (1, 1)-
forms on y3 with the (1, 2)-forms on the mirror manifold y3 and for that reason we use the same indices
already at this stage.

7the reason is that in type iib vacua the (1, 2)-forms reside in vector multiplets and the geometry

of their scalars is constrained to be special kahler.

4.2 the map

the geometrical compactication of the eective low energy iib supergravity from d = 10
to d = 4 is only valid in the large volume limit of y3. in this limit the calabi-yau volume v
is a cubic function of the (1, 1) moduli va and the intersection numbers abc are constant.
in order to display the map between iia and iib one has to take a similar limit on the
iia side. this limit  termed the large complex structure limit  has been studied in
the literature [18, 21]. for us the important point is that such a limit exists and in this
limit the prepotential of the complex structure moduli is given by

f =

the map of the eld variables is obtained by comparing the two lagrangians (20) and
(38). first of all one learns that the dilatons of the the two theories have to be identied

perturbation theory. furthermore, one is led to the straightforward identication

4.3 worldsheet instanton corrections

after having established the map between the type iia and type iib variables in the
large volume/large complex structure limit we can discuss the corrections away from this
limit. mirror symmetry assures the equivalence of iia and iib compactied on mirror
manifolds and it becomes a matter of convenience in what variables one describes the
action. the  corrections to the large volume limit are most easily discussed in terms
of type iia variables and the holomorphic prepotential f (z). in the large volume limit
f (z) is cubic (cf. (34)) while sub-leading () corrections are known to be [18, 22, 23]

in order to obtain the type iib eective action (in terms of type iia variables) one inserts
(43) into (29) using (30)(33). the same action can be expressed in terms of type iib
variables by using the transformations (39) and (41). this last step is necessary in order
to discuss the fate of the sl(2, z) symmetry away from the large volume limit. it is this
aspect we now turn to.

4.4 symmetry properties

let us rst identify the pq symmetries of type iib in the type iia lagrangian (29). it is
invariant under 2 h(1,2) + 3 continuous pq symmetries (with parameters i, i, ) which
act on the elds as follows

i = i ,

 i = i ,

(45)
the 2  (h(1,2) + 1) symmetries of the rst two terms are due to the fact that i and i
arise in the r-r sector while the last symmetry is the pq symmetry which any scalar
dual to an antisymmetric tensor has. in the large complex structure limit the lagrangian
(38) is invariant under h(1,2) additional continuous pq symmetries which act on xa but
also on  i and  i [24]8

  =  + i i  i  i .

xa = a ,

ya = 0 ,

 0 = 0 ,

(46)

the total number of (3  h(1,2) + 3) pq symmetries in the type iia theory correspond
to the (3  h(1,2) + 2) pq symmetries of type iib displayed in (23), (24) together with
one of the generators of the sl(2, z). more precisely, the sl(2, z) of eqs. (6) can be
generated by

 7  + 1 ,

,

(47)

where the rst transformation is nothing but the missing pq symmetry.9

worldsheet instantons break (46) to a discrete subgroup. it is a generic feature of
perturbative string theory that continuous pq symmetries of scalars arising in the ns-ns
sector are broken to a discrete subgroup by strong coupling eects on the worldsheet.10
on the other hand pq symmetries of elds in the r-r sector are protected and survive
the perturbative expansion of string theory. this discussion also applies for the sl(2, z);
the rst transformation of (47) shifts l of the r-r sector and is preserved in perturbation
theory. the second transformation of (47) transforms the dilaton and in section 3.3 we
observed that the entire (47) is a symmetry in the large volume limit. in order to discuss
the fate of the symmetry away from this limit we need the transformation properties of
the iia variables in slightly more detail. using (39), (41) (42) and (25)(27) one derives

8note that this symmetry is only given in its innitesimal form.
9since at the tree level the symmetry group is really sl(2, r) this pq symmetry is also continuous.
10 an exception to this rule are the scalars which are dual to antisymmetric tensors of the ns-ns

sector. for example the pq symmetry of  in eq. (45) is preserved in string perturbation theory.

note that the calabi-yau moduli and the 4-dimensional dilaton mix in a complicated
way and thus the complex za = xa + iya = b1a + iva transform not into themselves but
into a linear combination involving the  i. eqs. (48) show that the relatively simple
transformations (25)(27) become rather involved in terms of type iia variables and as
a consequence the sl(2, z) is hidden in the large complex structure limit of type iia.
or in other words, the type iia variables are not an appropriate basis to display the
sl(2, z) symmetry.

from (48) one also learns that worldsheet instantons break the second generator of
sl(2, z). inserting (48) into (43) shows that the prepotential transforms into a function
involving arbitrarily high powers of the dilaton e24 which cannot be cancelled by any
other term at the string tree level. thus strong coupling (non-perturbative) eects on
the string worldsheet do not respect the full sl(2, z). however, it is possible that once
non-perturbative eects in the 4-dimensional space-time are also taken into account [25]
the sl(2, z) is restored. work along these lines is in progress.

5 conclusion

in this paper we compactied ten-dimensional iib supergravity on a calabi-yau threefold
y3 with an arbitrary number of harmonic (1, 1)-forms. in the 4-dimensional lagrangian
this leads to h(1,1) tensor multiplets coupled to supergravity and a double-tensor multiplet.
the sl(2, z) symmetry of 10-dimensional type iib theory is also a symmetry of the
d = 4 action in the large volume limit where the 10-dimensional description is a good
approximation. the sl(2, z) acts naturally on the d = 10 eld variables and therefore
mixes the 4-dimensional dilaton and the calabi-yau moduli in a non-trivial way.

by mirror symmetry the type iib theory is equivalent to iia supergravity compacti-
ed on the mirror manifold y3. we veried this equivalence in the large complex structure
limit of type iia and displayed explicitly the relation between the two sets of eld vari-
ables. via this map we were able to obtain the action of the sl(2, z) on the type iia
eld variables. finally, we noticed that for small calabi-yau manifolds the sl(2, z) is
broken by strong coupling eects on the worldsheet (worldsheet instantons).

a appendix

throughout this paper we use the following notations and conventions: the signature
of the ten-dimensional metric is chosen as ( + + . . . +), capital latin indices are ten-
dimensional indices, greek indices from the middle of the alphabet are four-dimensional
space-time indices and the real coordinates of the calabi-yau threefold are denoted by
y ;  = 1, . . . , 6. we also use a set of complex coordinates ,   (,  = 1, 2, 3), being
dened as 1 = y1+iy2
together with their complex conjugates.

the conventions used for christoel symbols and the various curvature tensors are

the purpose of this appendix is to supply more details on the derivation of the
lagrangian given in (15). it is constructed by compactifying the d = 10 eective theory
of eq. (1) on a calabi-yau threefold. first of all the terms which do not involve the 4-
form dm n p q can be treated with standard methods. that is, the ten-dimensional metric
gm n is decomposed into a 4-dimensional space-time part g and a 6-dimensional internal
calabi-yau metric g  . this in turn forces a decomposition of the ten-dimensional ricci
scalar r10

r10 = r4 + gr

 + g  (r

 

+ r

 

) .

the calabi-yau metric g   is expanded around a background metric g0
deformations g

in d = 4 massless scalar elds arise as the inequivalent harmonic deformations of the
calabi-yau metric [26, 16]. more precisely one expands

g  = va(x) a

  ,

a = 1, . . . , h(1,1) ,

g = za(x) a

 ,

a = 1, . . . , h(1,2) ,

(52)

  are harmonic (1, 1)-forms while a

where a
 are related to harmonic (1, 2)-forms and
va and za are the scalar moduli. the za turn out to be members of vector multiplets
and therefore will be omitted in the following discussion. inserting (51) and (52) into
(50) and keeping up to quadratic terms in a results in [12] 11

the antisymmetric tensors bi

(53)

(54)

since there are no harmonic (2, 0) forms on y3 the bi
  are expanded only in terms
of harmonic (1, 1)-forms according to eqs. (9). finally, the ten-dimensional integration
measure splits according to

z d10xg10 = z d4xg4z d6ig6 ,

(55)

and the integration over the calabi-yau threefold can be performed using (12) and (13).
the two remaining terms in eq. (1) contain the 4-form dm n p q. as we discussed in
section 3.1 the massless modes in d = 4 arising from dimensional reduction of dm n p q
are vectors d  and tensors d  . not all of them are independent but related by
the self-duality condition (3). the vectors are of no concern here and so in the reduction
procedure we only focus on the tensor elds. in order to proceed we make an ansatz for
the couplings of the tensor elds where the individual terms are dictated by the reduction
of the last terms in (1)

l = g10(cid:16)k1(f  )2 + k2ij bi

11there is a slight inconsistency in the derivation of eq. (53) in ref. [12] in that not all terms contributing
at quadratic order are properly taken into account. however, this merely aects the coecients of
eq. (53). we thank m. haack for communicating the correct formula prior to publication. a more
detailed derivation of eq. (53) will be given in ref. [27].

and k1, . . . , k5 are constants to be determined. this is done by comparing the equations
of motion of (56) with the dimensionally reduced 10-dimensional eld equations. since
we only need to x a few constants we simplify the task by doing this comparison in the
limit l = 0,  = const. and g = . for our purpose the important eld equations
turn out to be

the rst equation is merely an equation for bi
for us. using the self-duality condition f  g  = 1
second equation in (60) yields for b1

where the overall normalization is determined by using the gauge invariance of eqs. (21)
and (22). (the analogous equations for b2
  are consistent with the same set of coe-
cients.) finally one adds (56) to the dimensionally reduced action obtained from the rst
three terms in (1) using (53), (54) and (55), performs a weyl rescaling g  v 1g and
integrates over the calabi-yau threefold using the formulae given in section 3.1. this
results in the lagrangian (15).
