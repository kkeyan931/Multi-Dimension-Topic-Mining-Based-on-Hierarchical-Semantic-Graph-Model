abstract

the general correlator of composite operators of n=4 supersymmetric gauge eld theory
is divergent. we introduce a means for renormalizing these correlators by adding a bound-
ary theory on the ads space correcting for the divergences. such renormalizations are not
equivalent to the standard normal ordering of current algebras in two dimensions. the cor-
relators contain contact terms that contribute to the ope; we relate them diagrammatically
to correlation functions of compound composite operators dual to multi-particle states.

1 introduction

recently much progress has been made in the understanding of superconformal n = 4
super yang-mills theories through a holographic description in terms of a iib string (m-)
theory on an anti-de sitter background [1, 2, 3]. the low energy eective supergravity of the
string theory probes the strong coupling limit of the cft at large nc; stringy/string-loop
corrections correspond to the expansion in inverse powers of the t hooft eective coupling
g2
y m nc and nc. an explicit example is the correspondence between type iib supergravity
on ads5  s5 and n = 4 super-yang-mills. correlation functions in the latter at large nc
may be determined from the supergravity theory through the relation:

k

yj=1  



0,j(~zj)! eissugra[(0)](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)0,j =0

k

= h

yj=1oj(~zj)icf t .

(1.1)

here, ssugra is the bulk action of the supergravity theory considered as a functional of the
boundary values of the elds, 0,j, and o are composite (gauge invariant) operators of
the conformal yang-mills theory. these operators are dual to the boundary values of the
supergravity elds in the sense that the latter act as sources for the former. in recent months
cft correlation functions have been analyzed using the holographic prescription in [4]-[21].
in calculations exploring the correspondence, one item which has been little addressed is
the fact that the correlations of composite operators are in general divergent. for example
the fourier transform of two-point functions of scalar operators o(~x),

ho(~x1)o(~x2)i =
ho(~k)o(~k)i =

1

|~x1  ~x2|2 
2dd/2(d/2  )

()

~k2(d/2) ,

(1.2)

is ill-dened whenever the dimension  of the operators is greater than or equal to d/2. for
a consistent description of the correspondence one needs to provide a regularization of these
short-distance singularities to make the theory nite. this issue has been discussed from
the cft point of view in [22] and has been briey mentioned in [3] in the context of the
duality with ads theories. we introduce here a modication of the ads/cft correspondence
through the addition of a boundary action, as a consequence of which the correlators are
made nite. dierent sets of boundary terms have been considered in [3, 4, 7, 10, 13].

a regulatory scheme is to compute the supergravity greens functions at points innites-
imally away from the ads boundary. this ir cut-o for the gravity theory acts as an uv
regulator for the cft [23, 24, 25]. by introducing counterterms with the associated scale
we are thus in eect renormalizing the cft through the ads boundary theory. of course
this violates conformal invariance. however, the prescription of [2, 3] considers not the cft

1

as such but its perturbation by conformal operators,

sn =4 sy m  sn =4 sy m +z d4~x0,j(~x)oj(~x) ,

(1.3)

where the source of the operator is the boundary value of a supergravity eld. on the other
hand conformal symmetry protects the dimensions of chiral primary operators and their
descendants. thus for those operators, whose sources are elementary supergravity elds,
the introduction of a regulator in intermediate steps of the calculation will not aect the
nal answer provided one keeps the operator insertions at distinct points [3, 5, 6]. however,
correlations of multiple operators may still diverge at short distances and these require the
introduction of counterterms [26]. this is in contrast to the niteness of the unperturbed
cft.

insertions of operators in the sym greens functions would yield counterterms that are
related to products of conformal operators at the same point. these compound composite
operators, e.g. : trf 2(~x)trf 2(~x) :, are neither primary nor descendants [27]. as we will see
such product operators are dual to multi-particle supergravity states. specic multi-particle
states were found to be necessary in the ads/cft correspondence in [28, 29]. here we
propose that the coupling of such operators to the boundary values of supergravity elds is
dictated by the above procedure. in [20] and [21] there has been some speculation on where
such states might appear in exchange diagrams between elementary supergravity elds.

in addition to the divergent nature of the correlation functions we nd that explicit
contact contributions appear in the evaluation of three- and four-point functions. their
fourier transformed k-space expressions are divergent but they also produce logarithms in
the kinematic invariants; they contain cuts. for example, the four-point function contains a
contact term of the following form

ho(~x1)o(~x2)o(~x3)o(~x4)i = n 2(d)(~x1  ~x2)

1

|~x1  ~x3|p (d)(~x3  ~x4) + permutations , (1.4)

together with products of multiple delta functions. through the delta functions this cor-
relator resembles the two-point function of the conformal operator : o(~x)o(~x) :, dual to a
multi-particle supergravity state. the purpose of this work is to focus on coincident points,
both how they relate to the regulating of divergences and the appearance of contact terms
in the calculation of correlation functions with physical implications. the results suggest a
way to compute correlators of cft compound composite operators from ads supergravity.
the outline of this work is as follows. in section 2 we recall how conformal transformations
constrain the form of correlators at distinct points.
in section 3 we review the greens
functions used in the computations and examine the asymptotic forms necessary for the
analysis of the contact-terms. in section 4 we examine the divergences within the correlators
by starting with a simple analysis of the two-point functions. our testing ground will be the

2

dilaton-axion sector of iib supergravity on ads5s5. in sections 5 and 6 we do the same for
three- and four-point functions. we discuss the multi-particle states in section 7. contact
term contributions are diagrammatically related to the multiparticle state correlators coming
from bulk ads multi-loop supergravity. lastly, in section 8 we discuss implications and
extensions related to this work.

2 conformal invariance constraints

in this section we briey review the constraints imposed by conformal transformations on
correlation functions of conformal operators.

conformal transformations preserve the line element up to a scale factor:

x  x

(x)

dxdx = 2(x)dxdx .

in d dimensions they make up the conformal group so(d, 2) generated by rotations,

x
 = r

x

r1

r2 = 12 ,  = 1

scale transformations,

x
 = x

2 = 2 ,

and special conformal transformations,

x

 = 1(x)hx + vx2i

(x) = 1 + 2v  x + v2x2 .

alternatively we may use inversion,

x
 =

x
x2

(x) = x2 ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

instead of the special conformal transformations to build up the generators of the group.

conformal operators oi of scale dimension  transform as

t  oi = di

j [r]oj .

(2.6)

this means that the correlator of two such operators must behave under an inversion as

ho( ~z1)o( ~z1)i 

1

|~z1  ~z2|2 

1
|~z
1  ~z

2|2 = (z1)(z2)

1

|~z1  ~z2|2 .

(2.7)

at coincident points, however, these transformations are singular. conformal invariance
constrains the correlators only when the points of the operators are at distinct separated
values. potential contact terms in the correlator are allowed and probe the short-distance
structure (uv region) of the conformal eld theory. as an example consider free-eld qcd

3

greens functions which are conformally invariant at non-coincident points [30]. only when
we investigate the short-distance behaviour and compensate for innities by the introduction
of counterterms do we nd scale dependence. these short-distance singularities have been
investigated in the context of conformal eld theories in [22].

note that there are no uv non-renormalization theorems for correlations of composite
operators in n = 4 super yang-mills theory, the reason being that they are not nite. non-
renormalization theorems as proposed in [6, 12] refer only to the independence of correlators
on the microscopic coupling g2

y m .

3 asymptotic form of greens functions

in this section we examine the relevant limits of the bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary kernels
necessary for an exact evaluation of the contact contributions to the multi-point correlation
functions examined in later sections. the theory we consider is the dilaton-axion sector of
iib supergravity on ads5  s5 with action

s =

1

22 z d5xqg(x)(r + 12/a2) + gh + e2cci

(3.1)

note that the interaction between the dilaton and axion contains derivatives. for the back-
ground metric on ads5 we will use the half-space poincare metric

ds2 =

a2
x2

0 (cid:16)dx2

0 + dxidxjij(cid:17) ,

i = 1, ..., d

(3.2)

where x0  0. we set the ads radius a2 to unity in the remainder and we will keep the
dimension d = 4 abstract whenever possible. the metric ij is minkowski with mostly plus
signature, and dd = 1.

the bulk-bulk correlator for massive scalars is given by

ddk

0

(3.3)

(3.4)

h(x)(y)i  g(x, y)

= (x0y0)d/2z 
where  = qm2 + d2/4 > 0 and ~k  ~x  pd

dz
i=1 kixi. we denote with ~x a (minkowski) four-
vector on the boundary of ads. the i prescription was provided in [19]. as the dilaton and
axion are massless we shall consider this case in the remainder of this work.
the bulk-boundary kernel (~x, y) is found by taking the small y0 limit,

(2)d ei~k(~x~y) j(x0)j(y0)

,

(~y, z) = lim

the extra factor of y
corrects for the asymptotic behaviour of the greens function. to
evaluate this limit we need the asymptotic behaviour of the bessel functions. at z  0 they
behave as

k(z) =

(3.6)

and at z   we have,
j(z) = (cid:18) 1
2z(cid:19)

using (3.6) we nd

cos(z + /2) + . . .

k(z) = (cid:18)

(3.8)

(3.9)

this kernel satises the appropriate dirichlet boundary conditions, as may be veried. for
the massless elds  = d/2 and in this case explicit integration over the fourier modes ~k
gives the position-space form,

(~y, z) =

(d)

d/2(d/2)  

z0

0 + (~y  ~z)2!d

z2

(3.10)

the dirichlet conditions on the bulk-boundary kernel may also be veried using the distri-
butional form above,

and a related identity is

lim
z00

(~y, z) = d(~y  ~z) ,

lim
z00

z0z0(~y, z) = 0 .

(3.11)

(3.12)

in the following we will also need the small z0 limit of the derivative of the bulk-boundary

kernel,

f (~y, ~z) = lim
straightforward dierentiation of (3.9) gives,

z00

(~y  ~z)2
0 + (~y  ~z)2]d+1) .

[z2

(3.13)

(3.14)

the functional form of the limit does not permit a naive interpretation as a distribution,
and we need to include a divergent coecient. the limits of (3.14) are:

~y  ~z 6= 0

: f (~y, ~z) =

(d + 1)
d/2(d/2)

1

(~y  ~z)2d ,

(3.15)

5

and

~y  ~z = 0

: f (~y, ~z) = 

(d + 1)
d/2(d/2)

1
y2d
0

.

we dene the z0  0 form of (3.14) to be

lim
z00

z0(~y, z) =

(d + 1)

d/2(d/2) (

1

(~y  ~z)2d 

1

d (~y  ~z)) .

(3.16)

(3.17)

the coecient  may be regarded as an innitesimal distance from the boundary at z0 = 0;
this can be explicitly veried by evaluating (3.13) using the momentum space formulation
of the bulk-boundary kernel.

4 two-point functions

conformal invariance xes the form of the two-point function of chiral primary operators
with dimension , the bosonic form of which is,

ho1(~z1)o2(~z2)i =

12

|~z1  ~z2|1+2

,

(4.1)

provided the points are kept distinct. correlators of descendents easily follow. this two-point
function is computed through the holographic correspondence by solving for the boundary-
boundary kernel between two dierent points on the boundary of the anti-de sitter com-
pactication and integrating over a two-point insertion in the bulk.
the fourier transform of the general two-point correlator (4.1)

ho(~k)o(~k)i =

2dd/2(d/2  )

()

~k2(d/2) ,

(4.2)

is divergent and must be regularized. this is not an ad hoc requirement, but follows directly
from the free-eld evaluation of the two-point function of the operator trij in n = 4 super
yang-mills theory. in this example the contribution is a one-loop self-energy graph whose
divergence equals that of (4.2).

the necessity of introducing a regulating scale may be considered as a conformal anomaly
[2] in the n = 4 super yang-mills theory. this resembles the naive scale dependence in the
tree-level bosonic propagator hx(z)x(v)i  ln(z  v) in open (or closed) string theory. the
value of the composite two-point correlator at coincident points is not determined through
conformal invariance but suers from operator product ambiguities and associated diver-
gences. in n = 4 super yang-mills theory we nd that there are further modications of
higher-point functions.

we will add to the two-point correlator a counterterm that eliminates the pathology at
short distance. in x-space counterterms are known to be provided in the form of distributions

6

with support at coincident points. such regularizations and renormalizations have been
extensively studied in the dierential regularization approach [30]. we shall modify the
two-point function to the following form,

ho(~z1)o(~z2)i =

1

|~z1  ~z2|2 + 2d2n2n(d)(~z1  ~z2) ,

(4.3)

where n =   d/2 is the integer part of   d/2.  is a dimensionful regulating scale
that permits the counterterm to be built out of operators with well-dened classical scaling
dimensions: 2n, where n is an integer.

the coecient  is determined by enforcing niteness on the fourier transformed two-
point correlator, and is divergent. with the addition of the counterterm and after dimen-
sional continuation the fourier transform of (4.3) yields

ho(~k1)o(~k2)i = (2)d(d)(~k1 + ~k2)

2dd/2
()

1

k2n (cid:16)1 + 2 ln(~k2/2)(cid:17) .

(4.4)

and is nite. the above follows from minimal subtraction with   1/(  d/2  n). all
of the two-point functions may be regularised in this manner. the renormalization scale 
may be thought of as an innitesimal distance from the boundary of ads.

rather than modifying the correlation functions by adding contact terms by hand, we
add a boundary action with these counterterms to the bulk anti-de sitter supergravity.
boundary term additions have been considered before within the purely gravitational anti-
de sitter action, with the addition of the gibbons-hawking term [3, 5, 7] and in the work
of [4, 13]. in our case we include the boundary term,

sb.t. =


2

2d2nz ddx 0(x)2n0(x) ,

(4.5)

where the boundary values of the supergravity elds, 0(~x) are dual to the composite elds
o(~x). the functional variation of (4.5),





0(~z1)

0(~z2)

sb.t. = 2d2nz dd~x (d)(~z1  ~x)2n

x(d)(~z2  ~x) ,

(4.6)

reproduces the counterterm in (4.3). this is exactly the procedure of composite operator
renormalization in the cft. in this case, since the two-point function is given to all orders
by its free-eld value, this can be explicitly veried. the perturbed cft,

sn =4 sy m  sn =4 sy m +z d4~xjj(~x)oj(~x) ,

(4.7)

requires counterterms consisting of all operators o of similar dimension or less. in particular
graphs with no external fundamental elds will require counterterms formed by products

7

j n(~x)  11 . in the ads/cft correspondence the sources j(~x) are the boundary values of
supergravity elds.

for two-point functions of correlators of operators corresponding to the dilaton and the
axion we have  = d and n = d/2. in this case the constants  and 1 and 2 are explicitly

similar terms occur for the boundary values of all the other supergravity elds.

5 three-point functions

we next analyze how similar divergent behaviour of the three-point functions can be com-
pensated by adding additional interaction terms on the boundary of the anti-de sitter space.
we will examine the correlator htrf f (~x1)trf f (~x2)trf 2(~x3)i whose supergravity dual is the
unamputated hc(~x1)c(~x2)(~x3)i amplitude. it arises within the ads/cft correspondence
by considering the contributions from the cc vertex,

scc =

1

22 z dd+1x qg(x)gcc ,

(5.1)

where g(x) is the background anti-de sitter metric, eq. (3.2). the value of the correlator
is computed through the use of the bulk-boundary kernel to be,

acc(~x1, ~x2, ~x3) = z dd+1yqg(y)(~x3, y)g(y)

 (~x1, y)(y)

 (~x2, y) ,

which through a partial integration may be expressed as

acc(~x1, ~x2, ~x3) =

(5.2)

(5.3)

here the parenthesis, (12), denote symmetrization, a(1b2) = a1b2 + a2b1. the bulk term
vanishes due to the fact that the bulk-boundary kernel in (3.9) solves laplaces equation.
we have used the shorthand i = (~xi, y).
inserting the kernels and the limits from section 3 we obtain two types of contributions
to the three-point function, a = a(2) + a(3), distinguished by the number of delta functions
present. we set the gravitational coupling  to unity from here on. the form a(2) contributes
at doubly coincident points ~xi,

the fact that this three-point function only contains contact terms is in accordance with the
constraints of conformal invariance [6, 12].

to have a well-dened fourier transform for the expressions in a(2) we add the boundary

action
bdy,cc = z dd~x c(~x)c(~x)2k+2(~x) + c(~x)2k+2c(~x)(~x) + 2k+2c(~x)c(~x)(~x) . (5.6)

(5.7)

to eliminate the contribution in a(3)

cc, with  determined from (5.5).

6 four-point functions

four-point correlation functions have the new feature that there are two types of holographic
feynman diagrams to analyze: the one built from two three-point bulk vertices exchanging
an intermediate supergravity eld and the contribution from a bulk four-point vertex. scalar
exchange contributions to the rst diagram have been analyzed several times [14, 15, 19, 21],
and are known to be reducible to an eective four-point vertex plus total derivatives in the
bulk coordinate. as we found in the previous section these total derivative terms contribute
as contact terms to the correlator. some of these have physical signicance and contain cuts
in the kinematic invariants.

it will suce to consider the s-channel scalar exchange contribution to the correlator of

four axions, hcccci,

cccc(~xi) = z dd+1yqg(y) z dd+1zqg(z) hg(y)y

(6.1)

following the steps in [14, 15] we partially integrate (6.1) with respect to both the y0 and
z0 coordinates. after partially integrating the y0 coordinate symmetrically we obtain a bulk
four-point vertex contribution

plus boundary terms. the second bulk term vanishes through the eld equation for the
massless scalar and the rst reduces to an eective four-point vertex. this contribution will
be cancelled by those from the t- and u-channel exchange diagrams [15]. partially integrating
the z0-coordinate there remain three types of boundary terms

it is straightforward to see that the y0, z0 contributions at  all vanish and the only
surviving ones are at the y0 = z0 = 0 boundary. evaluating these limits with the aid of
section 3 we nd that for m1 the lower limit also vanishes. for m2 we have two dierent
contributions with triply and quadruply coincident points respectively,

using 12f (x1) = 12f (x2) the result is symmetric under ~z1  ~z2 and ~z3  ~z4, as is manifest
in the original graph. finally we need to also include the t- and u- channel diagrams to nd
full bose symmetry. the sum of terms does not cancel.

proceeding as before we remove the innities by the introduction of a four-point contri-
bution to the boundary ads theory. the pure (divergent) contact contributions of m (b)
2 and
m (b)
3 are completely removed similar to the a(3) contribution in the previous section. further
modication of the boundary theory by nite terms may also modify their correlations in
the ads picture. as for the other terms, their fourier transforms contain imaginary parts
indicating that they contribute physically. in particular, the fourier transform of the scalar
exchange to the hcccci correlator [19] contains the s-channel cut,

and arises solely from the contact terms in (6.13) above. this is equivalent to the result in
[19] after simplication.

though we have not computed beyond four-point functions it is clear from the previous

results that the pattern of contact terms persists in higher order.

7 multi-particle states

composite operator insertions in eld theory lead to additional uv ambiguities in corre-
lation functions; their renormalizations require the addition of counterterms of products of

11

composite operators to the correlation-functions. recent studies have focused on position
space, where for non-coincident points conformal symmetry imposes tight restrictions on the
correlator expressions. operators at coincident points and counterterms have not been con-
sidered in detail. in this section we discuss these singularities based on the renormalization
of composite operators.

the ads/cft prescription comes with a natural regulator: the innitesimal distance
from the boundary of ads. we have found that the holographic supergravity description of
the cft suers from similar divergences when one tries to take this distance to zero. since
one expects the full string theory embedding to be nite one might ask how string theory will
account for these in the low-energy limit. this will not come from including stringy eects.
the free-eld result for the two- and three-point functions are conjectured to be exact to all
orders in g2
y m nc (stringy) and nc (string loop) corrections, yet the answer is still divergent.
it could be that these divergences are an additional feature of string theory in a d-brane
(ramond-ramond)-background, that is not yet understood.

considering n = 4 super yang-mills theory as a consistent theory by itself, one would
like to correct for the divergences by the introduction of counterterms. we have corrected for
the divergences in the cft correlation functions by the introduction of a boundary action
to the ads bulk theory consisting of a polynomial in the sources for the conformal opera-
tors. complete composite operator renormalization in eld theory also yields counterterms
consisting of compound composite operators which also come in a power series in the source
for the simple composite operator [26]. in double insertions of trf f in greens functions,
for instance, one would correct for the uv innities by adding to the n = 4 sym action a
term

s = sn =4 sy m +z d4~x j(~x)trf f (~x) + s(counter)

ci

pd z dd~x j(~x)j(~x)oi

s(counter) = . . . +

p are operators having dimension p (p  8) consistent with the symmetries.

where oi
in
particular the compound composite : trf f (~x)trf f (~x) : is one of them, though n-counting
arguments show that this term is suppressed as 1/n. this term reects on the supergravity
side how the compound composite operator is dual to a multi-particle state.

we therefore conjecture that such additional couplings should be included in the ads/cft
correspondence from the beginning (the renormalization breaks scale invariance). this means
we should consider n = 4 sym theory plus the space of all deformations

with the sources corresponding to boundary values of the ads elds as dictated by the

scale depends on the renormalization scale , the distance to the boundary, naturally. func-
tionally dierentiation of these operators in the theory gives rise to correlators of compound
composites after one interprets the delta functions (d)(0) = d. following the prescription
in [2, 3] the correlation functions of products of composite operators would then be given by
loop-like calculations in supergravity (point-splitting on the boundary indicates that these
couplings would arise from coincident point limits of single-particle correlation functions and
that the legs connecting to the boundary would be given by the bulk-boundary kernel). di-
agrammatically this is understood from pinching boundary points of the external elds in
the original holographic feynman diagram. this loop-like picture describes how the multi-
particle states interact with others, though such loops contribute at the same order as the
regular tree-level diagrams after appropriate normalization [16].

composite operator renormalization suggests these multiparticle couplings as in (7.2)
and (7.3). at the same time we have physical contact term contributions to the correlators
of simple operators. they resemble diagrammatically the multiparticle correlators; for
instance, the two separate delta function contributions a(2)
cc in (5.4) and (5.5) are
pictorially identical to such one- and two-loop supergravity diagrams on ads, respectively.
our calculations in earlier sections indicate the presence in the ope of contact terms which
modify the expansion via

cc and a(3)

(7.4)

such contact contributions are usually required for consistency with the ward-identies of
the theory [22, 31, 32, 33] and are therefore not subject to renormalization ambiguities.

finally it is worth noting that the ads/cft correspondence requires the existence of
multi-particle states which occur in specic long-multiplets of the ads supergroup [28, 29].
the above proposal provides a way of computing correlators involving such states.

8 conclusion

we have provided a scheme for the renormalization of composite operator correlation func-
tions within the ads/cft correspondence in the large n limit involving the addition of a
boundary supergravity theory to the bulk gauged supergravity theory. the general correla-
tion function is made nite by modifying the correspondence as,

where order by order the boundary theory sbt is chosen to contain counterterms renormal-
izing the correlators, as calculated in this work. this scheme does not maintain conformal

invariance. multi-trace states, whose dimensions are not protected, appear at coincident
points where ultraviolet singularities occur. although the microscopic n = 4 super yang-
mills theory is uv nite [34] there are no non-renormalization theorems for correlators of
composite operators. straightforward calculations of the two-point and three-point func-
tions, for example, show the presence of divergences and the need for a renormalization
scheme. it would be interesting to nd the renormalization in the string context.

the correlators we have examined possess both contact terms in their explicit expressions
and singularities which render their fourier transform divergent. the contact terms in the
form of delta function distributions contribute at coincident points - they appear discon-
tinously in the ope. diagrammatically they resemble correlators involving multi-particle
states which are dual in the ads/cft correspondence to products of single-trace operators
o(~x) at the same point. the dimensions of the latter are in general not protected which is
related to the divergences in the theory which occur at short distances (when points collide).
the renormalization and eective theory description of the correspondence allows one to
determine the couplings of such compound composite operators to supergravity elds.

given these results it appears necessary to examine in greater detail the conformal struc-
ture of the correspondence in the eld theory and possible deformations of the conformal
theory with the operators discussed here.
