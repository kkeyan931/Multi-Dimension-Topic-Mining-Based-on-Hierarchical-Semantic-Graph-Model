quark spectra in qcd are linked to fundamental properties of the theory including the identication
of pions as the goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. the lattice overlap-
dirac operator provides a nonperturbative, ultraviolet-regularized description of quarks with the
correct chiral symmetry. properties of the spectrum of this operator and their relation to random
matrix theory are studied here. in particular, the predictions from chiral random matrix theory in
topologically non-trivial gauge eld sectors are tested for the rst time.

an important property of massless qcd is the sponta-
neous breaking of chiral symmetry. the associated gold-
stone pions dominate the low-energy, nite-volume scal-
ing behavior of the dirac operator spectrum in the micro-
scopic regime, dened by 1/qcd << l << 1/m, with
l the linear extent of the system [1]. this behavior, in
turn, can be characterized by chiral random matrix the-
ory (rmt), which lead to a revival of rmt, rst used to
understand the energy levels of nuclear matter [2]. what
enters into the rmt description of the low-energy, nite-
volume scaling behavior are some symmetry properties
of the dirac operator and the sector of xed topological
charge under consideration [3,4]. the rmt predictions
are universal in the sense that only the symmetry prop-
erties, but not the form of the potential matters
[5].
furthermore, the properties tested in this letter can be
derived directly from the eective, nite-volume parti-
tion functions of qcd of leutwyler and smilga, without
the detour through rmt [6], though rmt nicely and
succinctly describes and classies all these properties.
the topological charge enters the rmt prediction via
the number of fermionic zero modes, related to the topo-
logical charge through the index theorem. the symme-
try properties of the dirac operator fall into three classes,
corresponding to the chiral orthogonal, unitary, and sym-
plectic ensembles [4]. examples are fermions in the fun-
damental representation of gauge group su(2) for the
orthogonal ensemble, fermions in the fundamental rep-
resentation of gauge group su(nc) with nc  3 for the
unitary ensemble, and fermions in the adjoint representa-
tion of gauge group su(nc) for the symplectic ensemble.
the classication according to the three dierent chi-
ral random matrix ensembles is intimately connected to
the chiral symmetry properties of the fermions. a good
non-perturbative regularization of qcd should therefore
retain those chiral symmetry properties. until recently
such a regularization was not known. the next best
thing were staggered fermions, which at least retained

a reduced chiral-like symmetry on the lattice.
indeed,
staggered fermions were used to verify predictions of chi-
ral rmt [7,8], albeit with two important shortcomings:
(i) staggered fermions in the fundamental representation
of su(2) have the symmetry properties of the symplectic
ensemble [9], not the orthogonal ensemble as continuum
fermions, while adjoint staggered fermions belong to the
orthogonal ensemble [10], not the symplectic one.
(ii)
staggered fermions do not have exact zero modes at -
nite lattice spacing [11], even for topologically non-trivial
gauge eld backgrounds, and thus seem to probe only the
 = 0 predictions of chiral random matrix theory [7,8].

the development of the overlap formalism for chiral
fermions on the lattice [12] recently lead to the mass-
less overlap-dirac operator, a lattice regularization for
vector-like gauge theories that retains the chiral proper-
ties of continuum fermions on the lattice [13].
in par-
ticular, the continuum predictions of chiral random ma-
trix theory should apply. overlap fermions have exact
zero modes in topologically non-trivial gauge eld back-
grounds [14], allowing, for the rst time, verication of
the rmt predictions in  6= 0 sectors. the nice agree-
ment we shall describe further validates the chiral rmt
predictions on the one hand and strengthens the case for
the usefulness of the overlap regularization of massless
fermions on the other hand.

the massless overlap-dirac operator [13] is given by

d =

[1 + 5(hw(m))] .

(1)

here, 5hw(m) is the usual wilson-dirac operator on
the lattice and  denotes the sign function. the mass m
has to be chosen to be positive and well above the critical
mass for wilson fermions but below the mass where the
doublers become light on the lattice. in this letter, we
will be interested in the low lying eigenvalues of h =
5d, which is a hermitian operator. relevant properties
of this operator can be found in ref. [14]. we will use the

unitary ensemble and the broadest curve is for the orthogonal ensemble.

ritz algorithm [15] applied to h 2 to obtain the lowest few
eigenvalues. the numerical algorithm involves the action
of h on a vector and for this purpose one will have to use
a representation of (hw(m)). we will use the rational
approximation discussed in ref. [14,16].

for fermions in the fundamental representation of
gauge group su(2), the overlap-dirac operator is real
since the underlying wilson-dirac operator is real [17].
they are therefore expected to fall into the chiral orthog-
onal ensemble. for fermions in the adjoint representation
the spectrum of the overlap-dirac operator is doubly de-
generate, since the spectrum of the underlying wilson-
dirac operator is doubly degenerate [18], and they are
therefore expected to belong to the symplectic ensemble.
we will rst present our results for the distribution of
the unfolded level spacing [2,19]. the unfolding of the
eigenvalues of h are done in the following manner. let
en
label the non-zero positive eigenvalues of h with n
i
labeling the conguration number and en
i1 for
all i. we are considering only the positive eigenvalues
of h, since the non-zero eigenvalues of h all come in
positive/negative pairs [14]. for fermions in the adjoint
representation of su(nc) the spectrum of h is doubly de-
generate and we only keep half the spectrum, dropping
the degeneracy. unfolding proceeds by rst sorting all
the en
in ascending order and associating the location
i
n n
is referred to
as the unfolded spectrum and the level spacing is sim-
ply given by (n n
i )/n where n is the number of
congurations. the distributions of the unfolded level
spacing, s, in rmt are well approximated by the various
wigner distributions [9]

tions with  = 1.8 as an example of the chiral orthog-
onal ensemble, on pure gauge su(3) congurations with
 = 5.1 as an example of the chiral unitary ensemble, and
in the adjoint representation on pure gauge su(2) con-
gurations with  = 2.0. the lattice size was 44 in all
cases. the various level spacing distributions are shown
in fig. 1. there is very clear evidence that the su(2) and
su(3) ensembles with fermions in the fundamental repre-
sentation fall into the orthogonal and unitary ensemble,
respectively, and the su(2) ensemble with fermions in the
adjoint representation falls into the symplectic ensemble.
we next turn to the distribution of the lowest eigen-
value for the various ensembles. chiral rmt predicts
that these distributions are universal when they are clas-
sied according to the three ensembles and according to
the number of exact zero modes  within each ensemble
and then considered as functions of the rescaled variable
z = v min. here v is the volume and  is the innite
volume value of the chiral condensate h i determined
up to an overall wave function normalization, which is
dependent in part on the wilsondirac mass m. rmt
gives for the distribution of the rescaled lowest eigen-
value for the orthogonal ensemble, expected to apply to
the fermions in the fundamental representation of su(2),
in the  = 0 and  = 1 sector [20]

we are interested in  = 1 since the eigenvalues are
doubly degenerate. a closed form expression is not
known for t(z2).
instead, a rapidly converging se-
ries [22,8] based on partitions of integers is available,

here, the integer partition  = {1, 2, . . . , d} has

length d and weight l() = pi i. a pair of integers

is associated with  = {(i, j)|1  i  l(), 1  j  i},
and 

i = card(j|j  i) is the conjugate partition.

we compare the rmt predictions with our data in
fig. 2. if one knows the value of the chiral condensate
in the innite volume limit, , the rmt predictions for
pmin(z) are parameter free. on the rather small systems

that we considered here, we did not obtain direct esti-
mates of . instead, we made one-parameter ts of the
measured distributions, obtained from histograms with
jackknife errors, to the rmt predictions, with  the free
parameter. our results, together with some additional
information about the ensembles, are given in table i.
we note the consistency of the values for  obtained in
the  = 0 and  = 1 sectors of each ensemble. alter-
natively, we could have used the value of  obtained in
the  = 0 sector, to obtain a parameter free prediction
for the distribution of the rescaled lowest eigenvalue in
the  = 1 sector. obviously, the predictions would have
come out very well.

for the two ensembles with the fermions in the fun-
damental representation, we also found 81 (for su(2)),
and 147 (for su(3)) congurations with two zero modes
and 1 and 3 with three zero modes. for the orthogonal
ensemble, we are not aware of a prediction for pmin(z) in
the  = 2 sector, while for the unitary ensemble our data,
albeit with very limited statistics, agrees reasonable well
with the parameter free prediction, eq. (4) with  from
table i.

for fermions in the adjoint representation, we keep
only one of each pair of doubly degenerate eigenvalues, so
 = 1 is the sector where there are two exact zero modes.
such gauge eld congurations cannot be assigned an in-
teger topological charge since integer charges give rise to
zero modes in multiples of four [23], and we note there

table i. the chiral condensate, , from ts of the distri-
bution of the lowest eigenvalue to the rmt predictions. the
third column gives the wilson-dirac mass parameter used,
the fourth the number of congurations, n , in each topolog-
ical sector and the last the condence level of the t.

are a signicant number of congurations with two zero
modes as seen in table i. the good agreement with the
rmt prediction found in this case lends further support
to the existence of congurations with fractional topo-
logical charge [18].

in this letter we have tested the predictions of chiral
random matrix theory using the overlap-dirac operator
on pure lattice gauge eld ensembles. we nd full agree-
ment with the unfolded level spacing distributions on all
three ensembles. we also found that the distribution of
the lowest eigenvalue in the dierent topological sectors
tted well with the predictions of chiral rmt, with com-
patible values for the chiral condensate from the dierent
topological sectors. this is the rst test of the inuence
of topology on the dirac spectrum in the microscopic
regime.
