abstract

we compute the kaluza-klein mass spectrum of the d = 11 supergravity compactied on ads2
s2  t 7 and arrange it into representations of the su(1, 1|2) superconformal algebra. this ge-
ometry arises in m theory as the near horizon limit of a d = 4 extremal black-hole constructed
by wrapping four groups of m-branes along the t 7. via ads/cft correspondence, our result
gives a prediction for the spectrum of the chiral primary operators in the dual conformal quantum
mechanics yet to be formulated.

1 introduction

among all known examples of the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3, 4], the least understood is
the ads2/cft1 case. the d = 1 conformal eld theory (cft), or conformal quantum mechanics
(cqm), has not been formulated and therefore no quantitative comparison between the two sides
of the duality has been made. see [5, 6] for proposals on the cqm and [7, 8, 9, 10] for progress
made in the bulk theory.

one of the most elementary check of the correspondence is to compare the spectrum of the
two theories. in particular, the kaluza-klein (kk) mass spectrum of the supergravity (sugra)
on ads is identied with the spectrum of chiral primary operators in the dual cft. one may hope
that the kk spectrum of a sugra on ads2 may give a clue to formulate the dual cqm.

the goal of this paper is to compute the kk spectrum in the cases where the ads2 is part of
a string/m theory vacuum. we specialize in the example of d = 11 sugra compactied on
ads2  s2  t 7. 1 we consider only the zero modes in t 7. from the string theory point of
view, this theory is a valid approximation when r >> r, r, where r, r are the radius and the dual
radius of t 7 respectively, and r is the radius of the sphere. in the main text, we will put r to 1 for
simplicity. to obtain this geometry from m theory, one begin with compactifying m theory on t 7
with the following brane conguration [11].

with suitable choice of the orientation of the branes, this conguration breaks n = 8 supersym-
metry (susy) of the d = 4 theory to n = 1. when the number of branes in each group is all
equal, the background metric describes a direct product of an extremal d = 4 reissner-nordstrom
black-hole and a t 7. see section 3. of [11] for more details. it is easy to show that the near horizon
geometry of the black-hole is ads2s2. the number of susy is doubled in the near-horizon limit
as usual, so we have d = 4, n = 2 susy. the super-isometry group of the theory is su(1, 1|2).
the kk spectrum form representations of the su(1, 1|2) superalgebra.

the methods of the computation used in this paper are well known from higher dimensional
examples. there are two approaches to the problem; one is direct sugra calculation [13]-[17],
and the other uses representation theory of superconformal algebra together with duality symmetry
of sugra [18]-[23]. we will adopt the rst approach and comment on the second.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we review the su(1, 1|2) superalgebra and

its representation theory following [18, 19]. in section 3, as a warm-up exercise we compute the
spectrum of a toy model, namely the minimal d = 4, n = 2 sugra. this model illustrates
many important aspects of the compactication on ads2  s2 in a simple setting. in section 4, we
present a summary of our main result. in section 5 and 6, we sketch the computation of bosonic
and fermionic mass spectrum of the realistic model obtained from the d = 11 supergravity .
we focus on the reduction from d = 11 to d = 4 and how the n = 8 supermultiplet break into
n = 2 multiplets.

as this work was being completed, we received [28] which has overlap with section 3 of this
paper. while this paper was being submitted to hep-th e-print archive, we received [29] which
considered the same model in a manifestly u-duality covariant way.

2 review of the su(1, 1|2) superconformal algebra
the su(1, 1|2) superconformal algebra is dened by the following commutation relations

the bosonic generators l+1,0,1 and j 0,1,2 generate the sl(2, ir) conformal group and the su(2)

the extra u(1) generator i must be added in order for the algebra to be closed. however, since i
commutes with all the other generators, we may work in the restricted fock space on which i = 0,
where the algebra precisely reduces to that of su(1, 1|2). 2

for a given integer n, the oscillator vacuum is identied with the lowest j 0-weight state of a
chiral primary operator. we act g+
1/2 on the vacuum to obtain the lowest weight states of other
primary operators in the supermultiplet. higher weight states of a given operator are obtained by
acting j + on the lowest weight state.

the quantum numbers of each state is easily computed using the explicit oscillator repre-
sentation of the generators (2.3a), (2.3b). the quantum numbers of the lowest weight state of
each primary operator are summarized in table 1. the total angular momentum j is dened by
~j 2 = j(j + 1). the number of states for each primary operator, 2j + 1, is also included in the
table.

3 toy model

as a warm-up exercise, we compute the mass spectrum of the minimal d = 4, n = 2 sugra.
it is the simplest sugra that admits the ads2  s2 solution with the su(1, 1|2) superalgebra.
the theory contains a single n = 2 gravity multiplet whose component elds are a graviton, a
massless vector and a complex gravitino.

3.1 result

the computation in the following subsections show that the kk spectrum of the toy model contains
the short multiplets in table 1 for all even n. we have two copies of each multiplet for n  4 and

towers on the top row satisfy h = j and correspond to chiral primary states. .

one copy for n = 2. the result is depicted in figure 1.

from the point of view of the sugra computation, each physical degree of freedom of the
elds in d = 4 give a kk tower. that explains why we have four bosonic and four fermionic series
of states in the spectrum. depending on the spin and the polarization of a given eld, the low lying
2, 1) modes may be absent. some of other low lying modes become massless and
modes (j = 0, 1
can be gauged away from the bulk spectrum. the absence of such modes is necessary in order for
the kk spectrum to arrange itself into representations of su(1, 1|2).

in addition to the bulk degrees of freedom, there may be modes that are pure gauge in the bulk
but can live on the boundary. the authors of [28] showed that the boundary modes indeed exist and
form one n = 2 and one n = 1 representations of su(1, 1|2) algebra. we included these boundary
modes in figure 1 for completeness. the appearance of n = 2 boundary modes is quite clear in
our calculation, but the n = 1 modes seem to require more careful analysis.

these equations admit dyonic reissner-nordstrom black-hole solutions. the near horizon geom-
etry of an extremal black-hole gives the ads2  s2 solution. the radius of the s2 is equal to the
schwarzchild radius of the black-hole. for simplicity, we consider an extremal electric black-hole
with unit radius only. then the ads2  s2 solution reads
r = (gg  gg),
r = gg  gg,

f = 2,
f = 0.

(3.3)

where the greek letters ,     and     label two dimensional indices for ads2 and s2 respec-
tively. the fermions are set to zero. we are interested in the mass spectrum of the uctuations of
the elds around this background. we use the following parametrizations of the uctuations.

g = g + h() + 1

2h2g, g = g + h() + 1

2h1g, g = h,

f = a  a,

f = 2 + a  a,

where the paranthesis denotes the traceless part of a symmetric tensor.

3.2.2 spherical harmonics decomposition and gauge choice

(3.4a)

(3.4b)

each eld can be decomposed into spherical harmonics. unlike higher dimensional spheres, s2
does not have genuine vector or tensor spherical harmonics. vector and tensor elds are spanned
by derivatives of the scalar spherical harmonics.

2()y i (j  2), h2 = hi
h1 = hi

2y i,
1y i,

1()y i + i
()y i,
y i + vi

h() = i
h() = hi
h = wi
y i (j  1),
a = qiy i + biy i (j  1),

a = ai

y i.

(3.5)

the composite index i species both the total angular momentum j and the j 0 eigenvalue m. the
restrictions on the value of j for some elds are due to the fact that

y (j=0) = ()y (j=1) = ()y (j=1) = 0.

(3.6)

not all the modes in the above expansion are physical since the (d = 4) graviton and gauge elds
are subject to the gauge transformations,

hmn = mn + nm,
am =  fmnn + m( + n an).
the functions m and  are also expanded in spherical harmonics.

(3.7a)

(3.7b)

5

we need to make a choice of gauge. first, consider the case j  2. we can gauge away h()
 terms. lastly, we use

completely by a suitable choice of . we then use  to eliminate the wi
 to eliminate the qi terms. with this choice of gauge, we note that

h = 0, a = 0.

(3.8)

for j = 1, h() modes are absent, so  can be used to reduce other degrees of freedom. we nd
it convenient to parametrize m and  as

(1)
 = (k + x)  y,
 = p  y  x  y,
(1)
(1) = q  y,

(3.9a)

(3.9b)

(3.9c)

where the dot product means the sum over the three components of j = 1 spherical harmonics. we
can use x, k and q to gauge away h1, w and q, respectively. under the gauge transformation by
p , v is shifted by p . this indicates that v is a massless gauge eld in ads2. indeed, the mass
term for v is absent as we will see below. being a gauge eld in d = 2, v has no propagating
degree of freedom in the bulk.

for j = 0, h(), h1, h2 and a are the only modes that remain. the gauge parameter  is
absent. we can use  to gauge away h(). the vector a becomes a gauge eld in ads2 with 
being the gauge transformation parameter, and again has no degree of freedom.

3.2.4 computation of the mass spectrum: j  2
altogether, we have ten equations of motion (3.13a) - (3.17). we already used (3.13b) to eliminate
1. we also note that (3.15a) implies (3.14a) for j  1. so, the number of independent equations
hi
is eight. we put off the discussion of (3.14b) and (3.15a) to the end of this subsection.

among the other six equations, (3.13c) and (3.16a) are constraints, and the other four are

dynamical equations for each physical eld. we rst use the constraints to set on shell. 3

v = 2v, a = a

(3.18)

to simplify notations, we are suppressing the superscripts i in the equations from here to the end
of this subsection. inserting these in (3.13a) and (3.16b) immediately yields

ple, see [15].

after some manipulations, the other two equations (3.15b) and (3.17) give

2
xv  (j2 + j  2)v  b = 0,

xa  j(j + 1)a  h2 = 0.

they are diagonalized by the following linear combinations of the elds.

they satisfy

s1 = b  2(j + 2)v, s2 = h2  2(j + 1)a,
t1 = b + 2(j  1)v, t2 = h2 + 2ja.

(3.22b)

in ads2, the scaling dimension of the operator corresponding to a scalar eld is given by [2, 3]

h = 1

2 (1 + 1 + 4m2).

(3.23)

this implies that the elds s1,2 have h = j and are chiral primaries, while t1,2 have h = j + 2.

it remains to analyze (3.14b) and (3.15a). inserting (3.15a) into (3.14b) and using (3.18), we

nd

it is also possible to show that in two dimensions, (3.15a) implies

(2 + 2)h() = ()(h2 + 4a)

(3.24)

(3.25)

it can be derived most easily in a light-cone coordinate and a conformal gauge. combining these
two equations, we nd that h() is algebraically determined by h2 and hence has no degree of
freedom. this argument is valid for j = 1 also, but not for j = 0.

3.2.5 j = 1

the computation for j = 1 differs from that for j  2 in two ways. first, h1 is removed by a gauge
choice rather than the constraint (3.13b) which is absent because ()y (j=1) = 0. second,
being a gauge eld in two dimensions, v has no degee of freedom and can be eliminated. the
equations can be diagonalized as before, and the three eigenstates are identied with the j = 1
points of the t1, t2 and s2 series. the absence of the corresponding point on the s1 series is a
consequence of the fact that v is a gauge eld.

8

3.2.6 j = 0

we have the eld equations for h1, h2 and a

2
x(h1 + h2) = 4a  2h1,

2
xh2 = 4a  2h2 + 4h1,

(a  a) = (h2  h1).

(3.26a)

(3.26b)

(3.26c)

recall that we gauged away h(). its equation of motion then gives a gauss law constraint,

()h2 = 0.

(3.27)

one can easily show that (in light cone coordinate, for example) the only normalizable solution to
the constraint is h2 = constant. it is consistent to set h2 to zero. we can eliminate the gauge eld
a from the h1 eom and nd that m2 = 2. this is identied with the j = 0 point of the t2 series.
this completes the derivation of the bosonic spectrum in figure 1.

3.3 fermionic mass spectrum

the linearized eld equation for the fermion reads

mnpnp =  i

2 (cid:16) f mn + 1

2

frsmnrs(cid:17) n.

(3.28)

the linearized susy transformation law plays the role of a gauge symmetry, that is, the following
variation leaves the eld equation invariant:

it is convenient to separate the trace and the traceless part of  and .

m = m  i fnl(cid:16) 1

(3.29)

(3.30)

we decompose the d = 4 gamma matrices in terms of the d = 2 gamma matrices as follows:

 =   1,  =     ( = 01).

now we can split (3.28) into four components

(/x + /y) + /y  2() = i,
(/x + /y) + /x  2() = i,

() + /y() = i(),
() + /x() = +i(),

(3.32d)

where the rst two equations are the traceless parts of the  and  components of (3.28), respec-
tively. the other two are the trace parts. here, /x,/y are the two dimensional dirac operators. the
gauge transformation law also divides into four pieces.

() = (),  = /x  i,
() = (),  = (/y + i).

(3.34)

see appendix b for the denition and properties of spinor spherical harmonics. for j  3/2,
it is clear that one can gauge away  completely. then (3.32c) sets i
() = 0. in turn, we nd in
(3.32b) that  satises the eom for a free massless spinor in d = 4. finally, (3.32a) determines ()
algebraically in terms of . as a consistency check, we substitute it into (3.32d) and nd the same
eom for . thus all that remains is to nd the mass spectrum of . after the spherical harmonics
decomposition, the equation reduces to

/+ + i(j + 1

2)+ = 0, /  i(j + 1

2) = 0.

(3.35)

the mass eigenstates are 1 = (1 + i)e and 2 = (1  i)f both of which have m = j + 1

the computation is slightly different for j = 1/2. to begin with, we note the following

2. 4

property of the j = 1/2 spherical harmonics.

 =  i

2  = /y = i.

(3.36)

it has three consequences. first, modes for () are absent. second, (3.32d) is trivially satised.
finally, the gauge variation of  vanishes for arbitrary . we choose to gauge away + and ()
using + and , respectively. with these in mind, we analyze the three eld equations. from the
coefcients of + in (3.32a) and (3.32c), we nd that

+ = 0, ()+ = 0.

(3.37)

the coefcients of  of the same equations yield

(3.38)
4 we may choose (1  i)e and (1 + i)f . the two choices are not independent, since one can multiply either of

them by  to get the other.

10

these two equations together imply that  has no propagating degree of freedom and can be set
to zero consistently. finally (3.32b) gives

(/x  i) = 0,
which we recognize as the j = 1/2 point of the 2 series.

(3.39)

the scaling dimension of the operator corresponding to a spinor eld in ads2 is given by

h = |m| + 1
2,

(3.40)

which implies that the elds 1,2 have h = j + 1.

4 summary of the main result

we now turn to the model which is the main interest of this paper, namely, the one obtained from
the low energy m theory. we rst dimensionally reduce d = 11 sugra to obtain d = 4. the
resulting n = 8 sugra contains 1 graviton, 8 real gravitini, 28 vectors, 56 real spinors and 70
scalars. compactication on adss2 keeps n = 2 susy unbroken. in the n = 2 language,
we have 1 gravity, 6 gravitino, 15 vector and 10 (complex) hyper multiplets. each multiplet has
4 bosonic and 4 fermionic real degrees of freedom. the 4 + 4 kk towers arrange themselves
into representations of su(1, 1 + 2) superalgebra. figure 2 describes the kk spectrum of each
multiplet. the gravity multiplet5 is identical to that of the toy model. the vector multiplet is
similar to the gravity multiplet, but it has two copies of the n = 2 representation. gravitino
multiplet contains two copies of representations for all odd n except for n = 1. hyper multiplet
includes the n = 1 representation.

in the following two sections, we explain the dimensional reduction of the eld equations from
d = 11 to d = 4, how different elds fall into n = 2 multiplets and how each multiplet produces
the kk spectrum given in figure 2.

all other elds are set to zero. this is the near horizon geometry of the brane conguration shown
in the introduction. the notational conventions for the indices are summarized in appendix a.

note that the background elds are self-dual in the so(4) for the four coordinates along which
the branes lie. equivalently, it transforms in the (0, 1) representation of so(4)  su(2)+ 
su(2). this follows from the requirement of partially unbroken supersymmetry. if any one of
the relative sign for the gauge eld is ipped, the supersymmetry is completely broken, even though
it is still a solution to the equations of motion. 6 this background breaks the so(7) isometry of
the internal t 7 down to su(2)+  su(2)3, where su(2)3 is the rotation of w8,9,10. these internal
symmetries will play a crucial role in grouping the elds, as will be shown in the next section.

5.2 linearized eld equations and reduction to d = 4

we linearize the equations in d = 11 in uctuations around the background,

gm n = gm n + hm n , fijkl = fijkl + 4[iajkl],

(5.4)

and then dimensionally reduce it to d = 4 by keeping only the zero modes of the uctuations in
internal t 7 = t 4  t 3. we then redene some of the uctuation elds,

h(11)
a + bs
mn = h(4)
aabc = c abc, amab = aab

mn  1

2(ba

m, amna = da

mn,

s)gmn, hab = bab, hma = v a
m,

(5.5)

the denitions of b, v, c, a, d remains valid when we replace the a, b indices by s, t indices. the
shift in hmn is the linearized version of the weyl rescaling which is necessary to absorb the volume
factor of the internal dimensions and put the action into the standard einstein-hilbert form.

also, one can do hodge dual transformation to reduce the indices of the tensor elds. the
tensor eld with three index, amnl is the most trivial one, its dual eld having rank 1 formally.
6in fact, supersymmetry requres that the product of the signs of the gauge eld be +1. we set all the signs to be

+1 using coordinate redenition and parity transformation.

13

this implies it has no dynamics. indeed, one can show explicitly from its equations of motion that
it has no degree of freedom and decouples from all the other elds. the next one we consider is
the rank two tensor eld da

mn whose linearized equation of motion is

m{[mda

ij] + f ab

[ij v b

m]} = 0

which turns into an identity if we introduce the dual scalar

3[ldmn]a + 3 f ab

[ij v b

m] = lmnkkda

then the bianchi identity for the original dlmna turns into the equation of motion for da,

the quantum numbers of the various uctuation elds with respect to the internal symmetries
are summarized below, along with that of the background gauge eld f ab

can divide the elds into small groups, where the elds belonging to the same group can couple
to each other. the elds within a group must have the same quantum numbers except the broken
su(2) charge, which can be shifted by 1 by the background eld. we label these groups by
capital roman letters. note that we separated the self-dual and the anti-self-dual parts of the elds
which are rank two tensors in so(4) by

5.3 computation of mass spectrum in each multiplet

we have separated elds which decouple from one another using their internal quantum numbers.
we should now disentangle the eld equations further and nd out which eld belong to which
n = 2 multiplet. obviously, the bosonic elds in the same multiplet satisfy the same eld equa-
tions, and the same for the fermions.

in this section, we jump to solve the equations of motion of elds in each multiplet, except
for the gravity multiplet which has been analyzed in detail in section 3. the reduction of the
equations obtained in the previous subsection to the nal form require somewhat lengthy algebra,
and we put it off until the next subsection. the complication partly arises from the fact that we

16

chose a specic d = 11 conguration from the beginning. although the m theoretic origin of
the geometry is manifest in this framework, the u-duality invariance of the d = 4 theory and its
symmetry breaking pattern is obscured. a manifestly duality invariant approach sketched in [20]
could simplify the process to a large extent.

5.3.1 hyper multiplet

minimally coupled scalars in d = 4 belong to this multiplet. clearly, the kk modes have m2 =
j(j + 1). it follows that h = j + 1. there is no gauge symmetry associated with the scalars.

5.3.2 vector multiplet

a vector multiplet contains a vector am and two real scalars 1, 2. in the simplest case, 1 couples
to a only and 2 to a. the eld equations for the rst group are

(2

x + 2

y  2)1 = 1
2f,
mfm = 41.

in the same gauge as in the toy model, a is expanded in the spherical harmonics as

we then get the equations

a = biy i.

x  j(j + 1)  2

 2

4

along with the constraint

j(j + 1)
x  j(j + 1)!  1
2

b ! = 0.

for j  1, one nds that the mass eigenvalues are

a = 0

m2 = j(j  1), (j + 1)(j + 2) = h = j, j + 2.

for j = 0, b is absent and 1 has m2 = 2, h = 1.

the eld equations for 2 and a are
x + 2

(2

(5.21b)
as in the toy model, one can use the constraint a = 0 to set a = a. the equations
then become,

y + 2)2 = 1
2f,
nfn = 42.

(5.16a)

(5.16b)

(5.17)

(5.18)

(5.22)

x  j(j + 1) + 2

 2

4

x

2
x  j(j + 1)!  2
2

a ! = 0.

for j  1, one nds the same mass eigenvalues as for 1 and a. for j = 0, a is a gauge eld in
d = 2 and can be eliminated, leaving 2 with m2 = 2, h = 1.

17

5.3.3 gravitino multiplet

minimally coupled vectors in d = 4 belong to this multiplet. one obtain two d = 2 scalars with
m2 = j(j + 1) for all j  1. for j = 0, the mode for a is absent and a becomes a gauge eld
in d = 2, so there is no bulk degree of freedom.

5.3.4 gravity multiplet

this multiplet was analyzed for the toy model case. conformal weights of the bosonic states satisfy
h = j, j + 2.

5.4 grouping d = 4 elds into n = 2 multiplets

group a

all the elds in this group are minimally coupled scalars in d = 4 and belong to the hyper-

multiplet.

group b

it is convenient to dualize f s

mn by dening

f s
mn   1

2 mn

klf s

kl  f ab

mnc sab+.

(5.23)

then the equation of motion of f s becomes the bianchi identity for f s, and the bianchi identity
for f s become

note that the right-hand side is the same as that of (5.11c). in terms of f s, the eld equation for c
becomes

n f s

nm = f ab

mnnc sab+.

(5.24)

f ab
mn( f s

2

mn + w s

2c sab+ = 1

(5.25)
clearly, f s  w s decouple from c and contribute to the 3/2 multiplet. since c is coupled to
f s +w s by f ab, we nd that c s47+ decouples and contribute to the hypermultiplet. the remaining
elds belong to the vector multiplet. in particular, c s45+ couples to as
 and c s46+ couples to
as

mn + f cd

mnc scd+).

 + v s

group c

18

writing down all the components of the eld equations and collecting those which couple to

one another, one nds twelve identical copies of the following set of coupled equations:

2( f + f),

2b = 2c = 1
nfn = (b + c),
nfn = (b  c).

a = biy i, a = ai

y i, a = a.

(5.26a)

(5.26b)

(5.26c)

(5.27)

as before, we set,

it is then easy to show that (b + c) belong to the hypermultiplet, (a + b) to the gravitino multiplet,
and (b  c) and (a  b) together to the vector multiplet.
group d

if we dene

c a = 1

3! abcdc bcd,

we nd that the eld equations have exactly the same structure as those in the previous group.

group e

first, b45 + b67, b46  b75 and b44  b55  b66 + b77 decouple and contribute to the hyper
multiplet. the other equations fall into six groups each of which contains one scalar and one vector.
each group gives the spectrum for half a vector multiplet. explicitly, the six groups are

6.2 computation of the mass spectrum in each multiplet

6.2.1 hyper multiplet

spinors with nonzero mass generated by the background gauge eld belong to this multiplet. after
diagonalizing the mass matrix, they satisfy the equation of motion of the form

mm + i01 = 0.

(6.10)

one nds that |m| = j + 1
acting on the spinors in this multiplet.

2  1, which implies that h = j, j + 2. there is no gauge symmetry

6.2.2 vector multiplet

minimally coupled massless spinors in d = 4 belong to this multiplet. one easily nds that
h = |m| + 1
2. there is no gauge symmetry acting on the spinors in this
multiplet.

2 = j + 1 for all j  1

6.2.3 gravitino multiplet

a gravitino multiplet contains a gravitino  and a spinor . in the same notation as in the toy
model, their coupled equations of motion break up as follows

(/x + /y) = i(  ),

(/x + /y) + /y  2() = i,
(/x + /y) + /x  2() = i,

() + /y() = 0,
() + /x() = 0.

(6.11a)

(6.11b)

(6.11c)

(6.11d)

(6.11e)

where we expressed the four dimensional gamma matrices as tensor products of two dimensional
ones as in the case of the toy model, and /x,/y are the two dimensional dirac operators. the gauge
transformation laws are given by

() = (),
() = (),  = /y,  = i.

 = /x,

22

(6.12)

one can always gauge away . then (6.11d) sets () to zero.

for j  3/2, (6.11b) determine () algebraically. the only independent equations that remain
are (6.11a) and (6.11c) with  and () removed. the mass eigenvalues are the same as those of
hyper multiplet: |m| = j + 1
2  1, h = j, j + 2. for j = 1/2, the modes for () are absent
and (6.11e) is trivially satised. eq. (6.11b) gives an algebraic relation between  and . so the
number of degrees of freedom is reduced by half. one nds h = j + 2 for all modes.

6.2.4 gravity multiplet

the equations satised by this multiplet was analyzed for the toy model case. one nds h = j + 1,
with number of degrees reduced by half for j = 1/2.

6.3 grouping d = 4 elds into n = 2 multiplets

group g

all the spinors in this group are massless and minimally coupled in d = 4 and belong to the

vector multiplet.

group h

we choose the following basis for so(4) gamma matrices,

4 =   0

1

0! , 5,6,7 = i  0

1,2,3

1,2,3

0

(6.13)

where i are the pauli matrices. in this basis, an so(4) spinor splits into two chiral spinors as

 =   

+! .

(6.14)

consider (3 + 2) rst. to simplify the equations, we use the letter  to denote (3 + 2) in
the equations to follow. in the basis we chose, the eld equation reduces to

we can further decompose the equation by setting

nn = i

(6.15)

(6.16)

after splitting each of 1,2 into two pieces according to their chirality in the non-compact d = 4
spacetime, and recombining those pieces which couple to each other, one nds that one linear
combination belongs to the vector multiplet and the other one to the hyper multiplet.

(s) except that it has twice as many degrees of freedom
as 3 + 2. we nd the same result even for +
(a) again except for the degeneracy. in counting
the degeneracy, one should remember the constraint a(a) = 0. in the basis we chose above, it
reduces to

(4)  i1(5)  i2(6)  i3(7) = 0.

(6.17)

group i

doing the same sort of recombination of spinors as above, one nds the following results.

1. a third of 

(a) decouple from all the other elds. they belong to the vector multiplet.

2. another third of 

(a) couple to +. they contribute to the hypermultiplet.

3. the last third of 

(a) couple to +

m. they belong to the spin 3/2 multiplet.

group j

1. a half of  decouple and belong to the vector multiplet.

2. a half of 

m decouple and satisfy the same equation as the gravitino in the toy model.

therefore they belong to the gravity multiplet.

3. the other components of  and 

m couple to each other. they contribute to the spin 3/2

multiplet.

the following table summarizes the result of this section.

a notations and conventions

we consider d = 11 sugra on ads2  s2  t 4  t 3. each manifold in the product is
parametrized by x ( = 0, 1), y ( = 2, 3), za (a = 4, 5, 6, 7) and ws (s = 8, 9, 10), re-
spectively. we use the indices (m, n,  ) to label all eleven coordinates together and (m, n,  )
to label the coordinates of ads2s2. the signature of the metric is (+   +). the eld strength
of a p-form potential in any dimension is dened by

fm0mp = p[m0am1mp].

(a.1)

b spherical harmonics

the spherical harmonics form a basis for the elds living on a sphere. in this appendix we consider
only the case of s2. we can construct them by considering the eigenstates of maximal commuting
subalgebra of su(2) group, which are the total angular momentum ~j 2 = j(j + 1), its z component
jz = m, the orbital angular momentum ~l2 = l(l + 1), and the spin ~s2 = s(s + 1). the case for
the scalar is easiest since s = 0 and ~j 2 = ~l2, which we identify with the laplacian on the sphere,
y, where y indicates two dimensional coordinates parametrizing the two-sphere. this expression
2
for ~l2 can be obtained by embedding s2 into three dimensional space, writing down ~l2 in terms
of the cartesian coordinates, which is quite well known, and reexpressing these in terms of polar
coordinates. therefore, by construction, we have

2
yy (j,m)(y) = j(j + 1)y (j,m)(y),

(b.1)

where y (j,m)(y) denotes the eigenstates with eigenvalues (j, m), which were dened above.

next consider the spinor spherical harmonics where s = 1/2. the easiest way to consider it
is to embed the sphere in the three dimensional space and use cartesian coordinates. we construct
them by taking the tensor product of scalar spherical harmonics with 2-component spinor, and
taking appropriate linear combinations. we then get the expression[27]

where the labels indicates the eigenvalues as usual, and all the harmonics are normalized to unity.
2, so the degeneracy is 2(2j + 1). however, it is
for given j, the only possible values of l are j  1

convenient for our purpose to group the spherical harmonics of given j according to the eigenvalue
of j  /y rather than m, l, where /y    is the two dimensional dirac operator on the sphere
with  given by the usual pauli matrices. one can show that

~j 2 = /2

(b.3)

by comparing the two dimensional operator with the expression in the embedding three dimen-
sional cartesian coordinates, so it is obvious that j commutes with ~j 2, and its eigenvalues are
2). however, it turns out that neither of ~l2 nor jz commutes with j. therefore we have
(j + 1
to nd two other operators which commute with ~j 2, j in order to distinguish linearly independent
spherical harmonics. we will not identify them since they are not needed for the present discus-
2   anticommutes with j. therefore given an
sion. note that the chirality operator   1
eigenstate with j > 0, which we denote by j
+, we have a counterpart j
+ and vice versa.
7 this immediately implies that there are same number of j
 states for given j.
since the degeneracy of total states is 2(2j + 1), we have 2j + 1 j

+ states and j

   j

+ (or j

 ) states.

we also state without proof that the lowest spinor spherical harmonics are killing spinors,

satisfying the relation
