abstract

we construct dual type i string descriptions to ve dimensional supersymmetric
xed points with enf +1 global symmetry. the background is obtained as the near
horizon geometry of the d4-d8 brane system in massive type iia supergravity. we
use the dual description to deduce some properties of the xed points.

1 introduction

the consideration of the near horizon geometry of branes on one hand, and the low energy
dynamics on their worldvolume on the other hand has lead to conjectured duality relations
between eld theories and string theory (m theory) on certain backgrounds [1, 2, 3] 1. the
eld theories under discussion are in various dimensions, can be conformal or not, and
with or without supersymmetry. these properties are reected by the type of string/m
theory backgrounds of the dual description.

in this note we will construct dual type i string descriptions to ve dimensional su-
persymmetric xed points with enf +1 global symmetry2. these xed points are obtained
in the limit of innite bare coupling of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories with gauge
group sp(q4), nf < 8 massless hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and
one massless hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation [5, 6]. the dual back-
ground is obtained as the near horizon geometry of the d4-d8 brane system in massive
type iia supergravity. the ten dimensional space is a bration of ads6 over s 4 and has
the isometry group so(2, 5) so(4). this space provides the spontaneous compactica-
tion of massive type iia supergravity in ten dimensions to the f (4) gauged supergravity
in six dimensions [7].

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we will discuss the d4-d8 brane system
and its relation to the ve dimensional xed points. in section 3 we will construct the
dual string description and use it to deduce some properties of the xed points.

2 the d4-d8 brane system

we start with type i string theory on r9 s 1 with n coinciding d5 branes wrapping the
circle. the six dimensional d5 brane worldvolume theory possesses n = 1 supersymme-
try. it has an sp(n) gauge group, one hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric representation
of sp(n) from the dd sector and 16 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation
from the dn sector. performing t-duality on the circle results in type i theory compact-
ied on the interval s 1/z2 with two orientifolds (o8 planes) located at the xed points.
the d5 branes become d4 branes and there are 16 d8 branes located at points on the
interval. they cancel the -16 units of d8 brane charge carried by the two o8 planes. the
locations of the d8 branes correspond to masses for the hypermultiplets in the funda-

mental representation arising from the open strings between the d4 branes and the d8
branes. the hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric representation is massless.

consider rst n = 1, namely one d4 brane. the worldvolume gauge group is sp(1) 
su(2). the ve-dimensional vector multiplet contains as bosonic elds the gauge eld
and one real scalar. the scalar parametrizes the location of the d4 branes in the interval,
and the gauge group is broken to u(1) unless the d4 brane is located at one of the xed
points. a hypermultiplet contains four real (two complex) scalars. the nf massless
matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental and the antisymmetric hypermultiplet (which
is a trivial representation for sp(1)) parametrize the higgs branch of the theory. it is the
moduli space of so(2nf ) one-instanton. the theory has an su(2)r r-symmetry. the
two supercharges as well as the scalars in the hypermultiplet transform as a doublet under
su(2)r. in addition, the theory has a global su(2)  so(2nf )  u(1)i symmetry. the
su(2) factor of the global symmetry group is associated with the massless antisymmetric
hypermultiplet and is only present if n > 1, the so(2nf ) group is associated with the
nf massless hypermultiplets in the fundamental and the u(1)i part corresponds to the
instanton number conservation.

consider the d8 brane background metric. it takes the form

ds2 = h 1/2

(2.1)

h8 is a harmonic function on the interval parametrized by z. therefore h8 is a piecewise
linear function in z where the slope is constant between two d8 branes and decreases by
one unit for each d8 brane crossed. thus,

ls 
where the zi denote the locations of the 16 d8 branes.

denote the d4 brane worldvolume coordinates by t, x1 . . . x4. the d4 brane is located
at some point in x5 . . . x8 and z. we can consider it to be a probe of the d8 branes
background. the gauge coupling g of the d4 brane worldvolume theory and the harmonic
function h8 are related as can be seen by expanding the dbi action of a d4 brane in the
background (2.2). we get

take ls  0 keeping the gauge coupling g xed, thus,

(2.5)

where the masses mi = zi
. note that in the eld theory limit we are studying the region
l2
s
near z = 0. the coordinate  takes values in r+ and parametrizes the eld theory
coulomb branch.

seiberg argued [5] that the theory at the origin of the coulomb branch obtained in
the limit gcl =  with nf < 8 massless hypermultiplets is a non trivial xed point. the
restriction nf < 8 can be seen in the supergravity description as a requirement for the
harmonic function h8 in equation (2.2) to be positive when c = 0 and zi = 0. at the xed
point the global symmetry is enhanced to su(2)  enf +1. the higgs branch is expected
to become the moduli space of enf +1 one-instanton.

the generalization to n = q4 d4 branes is straightforward [6]. the gauge group is now
sp(q4) and the global symmetry is as before. the higgs branch is now the moduli space
of so(2nf ) q4-instantons. at the xed point the global symmetry is enhanced as before
and the higgs branch is expected to become the moduli space of enf +1 q4-instanton. our
interest in this paper will be in nding dual string (supergravity) descriptions of these
xed points.

3 the supergravity (string) description

the low energy description of our system is given by type i supergravity [8]. the region
between two d8 branes is, as discussed in [9], described by massive type iia supergravity
[10]. the congurations that we will study have nf d8 branes located at one o8 plane
and 16nf d8 branes at the other o8 plane. therefore we are always between d8 branes
and never encounter the situation where we cross d8 branes, and the massive type iia
supergravity description is sucient.

the bosonic part of the massive type iia action (in string frame) including a six-form

gauge eld strength which is the dual of the rr four-form eld strength is

(3.3)

for identifying the solutions of d4 branes localized on d8 branes it is more convenient
to start with the conformally at form of the d8 brane supergravity solution. it takes
the form [8]

ds2 = (z)2(cid:16)dt2 + . . . + dx2
e = c(cid:18)3

in these coordinates the harmonic function of q4 localized d4 branes in the near horizon
limit derived from (3.3) reads

h4 =

l10/3
s

(r2 + z2)5/3

.

(3.5)

this localized d4-d8 brane system solution, in a dierent coordinate system, has been
constructed in [11]. one way to determine the harmonic function (3.5) of the localized
d4 branes is to solve the laplace equation in the background of the d8 branes.

it is useful to make a change of coordinates z = r sin , r = r cos , 0    /2. we

(3.9)

(3.10)

the ten dimensional space described by (3.9) is a bration of ads6 over s 4. it is the
most general form of a metric that has the isometry of an ads6 space [13]. the space
has a boundary at  = 0 which corresponds to the location of the o8 plane (z = 0). the
boundary is of the form ads6  s 3. in addition to the so(2, 5) ads6 isometries, the
ten dimensional space has also so(4) isometries associated with the spherical part of the
metric (3.9). in general s 4 has the so(5) isometry group. however, this is reduced due
to the warped product structure. as is easily seen from the form of the spherical part
(3.7), only transformations excluding the  coordinate are isometries of (3.9). we are left
with an so(4)  su(2)  su(2) isometry group.

the two dierent viewpoints of the d4-d8 brane system, the near horizon geome-
try of the brane system on one hand, and the low energy dynamics on the d4 branes
worldvolume on the other hand suggest a duality relation. namely, type i string theory
compactied on the background (3.9), (3.10) with a 4-form ux of q4 units on s 4 is dual
to an n = 2 supersymmetric ve dimensional xed point4. the xed point is obtained
in the limit of innite coupling of sp(q4) gauge theory with nf hypermultiplets in the

4the 4-form ux is just the dual of the 6-form in (3.6).

fundamental representation and one hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric representation,
where m  (8  nf ) as in (3.2). the so(2, 5) symmetry of the compactication corre-
sponds to the conformal symmetry of the eld theory. the su(2)  su(2) symmetry of
the compactication corresponds su(2)r r-symmetry and to the su(2) global symmetry
associated with the massless hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric representation.

at the boundary  = 0 the dilaton (3.10) blows up and type i is strongly coupled.
in the weakly coupled dual heterotic string description this is seen as an enhancement of
the gauge symmetry to enf +1. one can see this enhancement of the gauge symmetry in
the type i description by analysing the d0 brane dynamics near the orientifold plane
[14, 15]. this means that we have enf +1 vector elds that propagate on the ads6  s 3
boundary, as in the horava-witten picture [16]. the scalar curvature of the background

blows up at the boundary as well. in the dual heterotic description the dilaton is small
but the curvature is large, too. for large q4 there is a region, sin   q
, where both
curvature (3.11) and dilaton (3.10) are small and thus we can trust supergravity.

the ads6 supergroup is f (4). its bosonic subgroup is so(2, 5)  su(2). romans
constructed an n = 4 six dimensional gauged supergravity with gauge group su(2) that
realizes f (4) [7]. it was conjectured in [17] that it is related to a compactication of the
ten dimensional massive type iia supergravity. indeed, we nd that the ten dimensional
background space is the warped product of ads6 and s 4 (3.9) (with nf = 0). the
reduction to six dimensions can be done in two steps. first we can integrate over the
coordinate . this yields a nine dimensional space of the form ads6  s 3. we can then
reduce on s 3 to six dimensions, while gauging its isometry group. romans construction
is based on gauging an su(2) subgroup of the so(4) isometry group.

the massive type iia supergravity action in the (string frame) goes like

l8

s z ge2r  q5/2

4

,

(3.12)

suggesting that the number of degrees of freedom goes like q5/2
in the regime where it is
an applicable description. terms in the type i action coming from the d8 brane dbi
action turn out to be of the same order. viewed from m theory point of view, we expect
the corrections to the supergravity action to go like l3
se  1/q4, where lp is the
eleven-dimensional planck length. this seems to suggest that the eld theory has a 1/q4
expansion at large q4. for example, the one-loop correction of the form

(3.13)

is suppressed by q2

4 compared to the tree-level action.

according to the ads/cft correspondence the spectrum of chiral primary operators
of the xed point theory can be derived from the spectrum of kaluza-klein excitations of
massive type iia supergravity on the background (3.9). we will not carry out the detailed
analysis here but make a few comments. the operators fall into representations of the
f (4) supergroup. as in the case of the six dimensional (0, 1) xed point with e8 global
symmetry [18] we expect enf +1 neutral operators to match the kaluza-klein reduction
of elds in the bulk geometry, and enf +1 charged operators to match the kaluza-klein
reduction of elds living on the boundary. among the enf +1 neutral operators we expect
to have dimension 3k/2 operators of the type t rk where  is a complex scalar in the
hypermultiplet, which parametrize the higgs branch of the theory. like in [18] we do
not expect all these operators to be in short multiplets. we expect that those in long
multiplets will generically receive 1/q4 corrections to their anomalous dimensions. unlike
the hypermultiplet, the vector multiplet in ve dimensions is not a representation of
the superconformal group f (4). therefore, we do not expect kaluza-klein excitations
corresponding to neutral operators of the type t rk where  is a real scalar in the vector
multiplet, which parametrizes the coulomb branch of the theory. among the enf +1
charged operators we expect to have the dimension four enf +1 global symmetry currents
that couple to the massless enf +1 gauge elds on the boundary.
