abstract

we study properties of a scalar quantum eld theory on the two-dimensional
noncommutative plane with eq(2) quantum symmetry. we start from the
consideration of a rstly quantized quantum particle on the noncommutative
plane. then we dene quantum elds depending on noncommutative coordi-
nates and construct a eld theoretical action using the eq(2)-invariant measure
on the noncommutative plane. with the help of the partial wave decompo-
sition we show that this quantum eld theory can be considered as a second
quantization of the particle theory on the noncommutative plane and that this
eld theory has (contrary to the common belief) even more severe ultraviolet
divergences than its counterpart on the usual commutative plane. finally,
we introduce the symmetry transformations of physical states on noncommu-
tative spaces and discuss them in detail for the case of the eq(2) quantum
group.

1 introduction

it is generally believed that the picture of space-time as a manifold m should break
down at very short distances of the order of the planck length. one possible approach
to the description of physical phenomena at small distances is based on noncommutative
geometry of space-time. there have been investigations in the context of connes approach
[1] to gravity and the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions [2, 3] and
in the framework of the string theory [4]. another approach starting from study of a
relation between measurements at very small distances and black hole formations has
been developed in the pioneering works [5]. one more possibility is based on quantum
group theory (see, e.g., [6]).

the essence of the noncommutative geometry consists in reformulating rst the ge-
ometry in terms of commutative algebras and modules of smooth functions, and then
generalizing them to their noncommutative analogs. if the notions of the noncommuta-
tive geometry are used directly for the description of the space-time, the notion of points
as elementary geometrical entity is lost and one may expect that an ultraviolet cuto
appears.

as is well known from the standard quantum mechanics, a quantization of any com-
pact space, in particular a sphere, leads to nite-dimensional representations of the cor-
responding operators, so that in this case any calculation is reduced to manipulations
with nite-dimensional matrices and thus there is simply no place for uv-divergences
(see [7, 8, 9] and refs. therein). things are not so easy in the case of noncompact man-
ifolds. the quantization leads to innite-dimensional representations and we have no
guarantee that noncommutativity of the space-time coordinates removes uv-divergences.
in our preceding paper [10] we have shown that ultraviolet behaviour of a eld theory
on a noncommutative space-time is sensitive to the topology of the space-time, namely
to its compactness. we considered theories on a two-dimensional plane with heisenberg-
like commutation relations among coordinates (see also [5, 11]) and on a noncommutative
cylinder. while the former retains the divergent tadpoles (as an ordinary qft), the latter
proves to be uv-nite. we argued that the underlying reason for such a uv-behaviour of
the models is related to the properties of the complete coordinate-momentum quantum
mechanical algebra and to the fact that the momenta degrees of freedom are associated to
the fully noncompact heisenberg-weyl group manifold in the rst case and to the cylinder
in the second case (the cylinder has one compact dimension).

using these qualitative arguments, we supposed that the quantum eld theory con-
structed on the q-deformed plane [12, 13, 14] with eq(2)-symmetry also has uv-divergences.
we have proved that indeed there are no kinematical reasons for this model to be uv-
nite: the green function of the free theory on the q-plane is singular. moreover, we have
shown that the interaction with an external eld does produce divergent tadpole. how-
ever, in the paper [10] we used decomposition of the elds on the q-plane in the so-called
distorted plane waves (q-deformed exponential functions). this makes dicult matching
the q-deformed eld theory with the corresponding rstly quantized quantum mechanics
of particles on the q-deformed plane and due to the absence of the additivity property for
the q-exponentials, makes an explicit calculation of nontrivial (e.g., 4-) vertices impos-
sible. thus the results of [10] have left open the possibility that the complete interacting
theory on the q-plane is uv-nite because of (dynamical) properties of the corresponding
4-vertices.

1

in this paper we use another decomposition of the elds, namely, the decomposition in
partial waves, similar to the recently proposed spherical eld theory [15] on commutative
spaces. this decomposition together with the haar (eq(2)-invariant) measure and q-
deformed integral used for the denition of the eld theoretical action, allows to present
the eld theory on the q-deformed plane as a lattice theory of innite number of interacting
one-dimensional elds (partial waves). the resulting eld theoretical degrees of freedom
are in transparent correspondence with the spectrum of operators in the rstly quantized
version of the model. the calculation of the tadpole with the account of the 4-vertex
shows that uv-properties of the theory on the q-deformed plane are even worse than
those on the ordinary commutative plane. this fact conrms the conclusion of the paper
[10] that the very transition to the noncommutative space-times does not guarantee uv-
niteness.

the example of the plane with the most simple and natural heisenberg-like commu-
tation relations among coordinates was used in [10] also for study of symmetry trans-
formations of noncommutative space-times with lie algebra commutation relations for
coordinates. the noncommutative coordinates prove to be tensor operators, and we con-
sidered concrete examples of the corresponding transformations of localized states (analog
of space-time point transformations). in this paper, we extend this consideration to the
much more involved case of quantum group coaction on noncommutative space-times.
more precisely, we derive the rules of transformations of particle states induced by the
coaction of a quantum group.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we consider rstly quantized theory of
particles on the q-deformed plane p (2)
q with eq(2)-symmetry. we derive representations of
the algebras of coordinates and momenta on the q-plane and nd spectra of the relevant
operators. in section 3 the eld theory (second quantization) on p (2)
is introduced and
presented in the form of innite number of interacting partial waves dened on a one-
dimensional lattice, the partial wave at the sites of the lattice (interpreted as creation and
annihilation operators) being in one-to-one correspondence with spectra of the quantum
mechanical operators found in section 2. calculation of a tadpole diagram shows that
the model has even more severe uv-divergences than the standard two-dimensional scalar
4-theory. in section 4 we are interested in transformation properties of a system on p (2)
under the coaction of the quantum group eq(2). the point is that now the coordinates
z, z are noncommuting operators and eq(2) provides only existence of coaction, i.e., ho-
momorphism of the algebra of functions on p (2)
of
algebras of functions on the quantum group and plane. then the question is: how does
this coaction inuence states of a quantum system on p (2)
q ? in other words, if a system
is in some state  (say, with a denite value of one of the coordinate operators, z or
z or some their combination) we are interested in determination of the state after the
eq(2)-group coaction. in subsection 4.1 we clarify a general formulation of this problem
and then (in subsection 4.2) give an explicit answer for the eq(2) group. section 5 is
devoted to the summary of the results.

2 quantum mechanics on the noncommutative plane

with quantum eq(2) group symmetry

in this paper we consider quantum mechanics induced by a quantum group structure.
recall that in the case of ordinary lie group g, the group structure denes a unique sym-
plectic structure on the cotangent bundle t g to the group manifold g (see, e.g., [16]) and,
hence, the corresponding canonical quantization (via substitution of poisson brackets by
the corresponding commutators). a similar construction with necessary generalizations,
can be carried out for lie-poisson groups, which after the quantization procedure become
quantum groups (see, e.g., review in [6] and refs. therein).

in fact, the quantization of a system on a lie group cotangent bundle t g corre-
sponds to choice of the group manifold as a conguration space (i.e., group parameters
as space coordinates) and left- (or right-)invariant vector elds on g (elements of the
corresponding lie algebra) as quantum mechanical momenta. instead of using a whole
group g, one can start from some of its coset (homogeneous) space g/h, where h is
in this approach the basic problem of quantum mechanics, i.e.,
a subgroup h  g.
determination of possible representations of canonical operators, is reduced to mathemat-
ically well-developed problem of construction of regular representation (or quasi-regular,
if one deals with a homogeneous space) and its decomposition into irreducible parts (see,
e.g., [17]). in some particular cases this general construction becomes rather simple and
quite familiar from elementary course on quantum mechanics. for example, let us con-
sider a two-dimensional euclidean group e(2) = u(1) t2 containing rotations and
its homogeneous space p (2) = e(2)/u(1) is
translations of a two-dimensional plane.
the euclidean plane with the metric ij = diag {+1, +1} which is invariant with respect
to e(2)-transformations. this conguration space is parameterized by two coordinates
x1, x2, while left-invariant elds tangent to this homogeneous space are nothing but usual
derivatives which up to the factor ih correspond to the standard momentum operators.
as is well-known, any representation of the algebra of coordinates and left-invariant vec-
tor elds on p (2) is unitary equivalent to this representation by the coordinate functions
and derivatives in the hilbert space h = l2(ir2) of square integrable functions. states
(x)  h are transformed according to representations of e(2) in the hilbert space h.
since the coordinate operators are commuting, their eigenvalues are transformed under an
action of e(2)-group as their classical counterparts: in the convenient complex notation

the e(2) transformations read as

z = x1 + ix2 ,

z = x1  ix2 ,

z  z = vz + t
z  z = vz + t

(1)

where v, v subjected to the constraint vv = 1, dene two-dimensional rotation group
u(1) and t = t1 + it2 , t = t1  it2 parameterize translations.
for the simple case of the quantum mechanical systems on the euclidean plane the
underlying mathematics related to cotangent bundle structures, regular representations
etc. seems to be redundant. but for generalizations to more complicated homogeneous

3

spaces, in particular, with non-zero curvature and nontrivial topology, the group theoret-
ical methods become quite actual and powerful.

in this work we are going to study another generalization:

instead of starting from
ordinary e(2), we shall use its quantum version eq(2) [12, 13, 14]. though in the case of
quantum groups and corresponding quantum homogeneous spaces (denition of the latter
see, e.g., in [14]) group parameters (coordinates) become noncommutative, the general
scheme of quantization still can be applied. the role of momentum operators is now
attributed the q-deformed left- (or right-) invariant generalizations of vector elds (see,
e.g., [18]). thus the planck constant h enters, as usual, the commutation relations (cr)
for momenta and coordinates, while the group deformation parameter q governs nontrivial
coordinate-coordinate and momentum-momentum cr. therefore, rst of all we have to
construct possible representations of this combined q-deformed algebra of noncommuting
coordinates and momenta. for the particular case which we consider in this paper (q-
deformed quantum euclidean plane p (2)
) this is not a very complicated problem and we
shall consider it in this section.

q

we start from the quantum group eq(2) generated by elements v, v, t, t with the

dening relations [12]

vv = vv = 1 ,

vt = q2tv ,

tt = q2tt ,

vt = q2tv

q  ir .

(2)

other commutation relations follow from the involution: v = v, t = t. the comultipli-
cation has the form

v = v  v ,

v = v  v ,

t = v  t + t  1i , t = v  t + t  1i .

(3)

the explicit form of other basic maps for eq(2) (antipode, counity) will not be used in
what follows.

the unitary element v can be parameterized with the help of the symmetric element

:

v = ei ,

 =  ,
 =   1i + 1i   .

(4)

the corresponding quantum universal enveloping algebra (quea) uqe(2) is generated by
the elements j, t , t which are dual to the generators , t, t of the algebra eq(2) and,
as a result of the duality, satisfy the following commutation relations

[j, t ] = it ,
t t = q2 t t

[j, t ] = i t ,

(5)

(comultiplication and the other basic maps are also dened by the duality).

the left action of elements from quea uql of an arbitrary lie algebra l on elements

of the corresponding quantum group gq is dened by the expressions

or

(x)f = (id  x)  f xi
(1)hhx, f i
f i
(x)f = (s(x)  id )  f xi hhs(x), f i

(2)ii ,

(1)iif i

(2) ,

4

(6)

(7)

where x  uql, f, f i
(1,2)  gq, hh,ii denotes the duality contraction, s(x) is antipode
and where the comultiplication in gq is presented in the form f = pi f i
(2). an
explicit calculation of this left action in the case of eq(2) shows that the operators t , t 
uqe(2) act on elements of eq(2) generated by t, t exactly in the same way as the q-
deformed derivatives q, q. in fact, the elements t, t generate the q-deformed analog
q = eq(2)/uq(1) of the homogeneous space p (2), i.e., generate the algebra of functions
p (2)
on quantum euclidean plane [14]. we shall denote elements of the algebra p (2)
by z, z
to distinguish them from elements t, t of the algebra eq(2).

(1)  f i

q

the elements z, z and q, q denes the q-deformed algebra of functions on p (2)
together with the q-deformed left-invariant vector elds (derivatives). its dening relations
read as

q

zz = q2zz ,

q q = q2 qq

qz = 1 + q2zq ,

q z = 1 + q2z q ,

(8)

qz = q2z q ,

q z = q2zq ,

(the commutation relation for the q-derivatives is just the rewritten commutation relation
for t , t (5) and those for the q-derivatives and coordinates are derived from (6)). if
we put q = 1 and dene p = ih, p = ih , the relations (8) become the usual
canonical commutation relations for a particle in two-dimensional space. the requirement
of consistency with antipode dictates the following conjugation rule for the q-derivatives
[13]

q = q2 q ,

q = q2q .

(9)

we consider the relations (8) as a q-deformation of the canonical commutation relations

and is going to construct their representation in a hilbert space.

to this aim let us introduce the operators n and n dened by the relations

[n; q2] = zq ,

[ n; q2] = z q ,

qx  1
q  1
these operators have simple commutation relations

[x; q] 

.

qn z = qzqn ,

q n z = q zq n ,

qn q = qqqn ,

q n q = q qq n .

using (9) and z = z, we nd

the operators q2 n , q2n allow to construct commuting pairs of conjugate operators:

n =  n  1 ,

n = n  1 .

z = qn n z ,

z = zqn n ,

p = qq(n n ) q ,

p = q1qq(n n ) ,

5

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

with the commutation relations

p z = zp ,

zz = z z ,

zp = 1 + q2p z ,

p z = z p ,

p p = p p ,

p z = 1 + q2 z p .

(15)

if we were given only the algebra of the operators z, z, q, q, we would reasonably
name the commuting operators z, z by coordinates and p , p by the corresponding
lattice momenta and then deal with two independent (commuting with each other) one-
dimensional algebras on the q-lattice. however, elds in nc-qft depend on noncommu-
tative (q-commuting) coordinates z, z which are more suitable to trace a result of coaction
by eq(2). we have found convenient to use the hermitian and unitary combination of the
coordinate operators:

r2  zz

(hermitian),

zz1

u 

(unitary),

(16)

together with q( nn ) (hermitian operator) and q2( n +n +1) (unitary operator) as a basic
set of the phase space operators. the commutation relations for this set of operators read
as

[q2( nn ), r2] = 0 ,

[q( n +n +1), u] = 0 ,

r2u = q2ur2 ,

[q2( nn ), q( n +n +1)] = 0 ,

(17)

q2( nn )u = q2uq2( nn ) ,

q( n +n +1)r2 = q2r2q( n +n +1) ,

now we are ready to construct a representation of this algebra in the space 2 (i.e., innite
dimensional matrix representation):

r2 | n, mir0,l0 = r2

0q2n | n, mir0,l0
q2( nn ) | n, mir0,l0 = l0q2m | n, mir0,l0 .

u | n, mir0,l0 = | n + 1, m + 1ir0,l0 ,

q( n +n +1) | n, mir0,l0 = | n + 1, mir0,l0 .

(18)

(19)

the constants r0 and l0 mark dierent representations and from the eigenvalues of r2
and q2( nn ) it follows that in the ranges [r0, q4r0) and [l0, q4l0) the representations are
nonequivalent. the matrices r2, q2( nn ) are hermitian and u, q( n +n +1) are unitary with
respect to the scalar product dened by

r0,l0hn, m | n, mir0,l0 = nnmm .

thus we have obtained that states of a particle on the quantum plane are characterized
by discrete values of its radius-vector and discrete values of the operator q2( nn ) which is
obviously related to deformation of the angular momentum operator. indeed, from (10)
we conclude that the operator

jq  [ n  n; q2] =

q2( nn )  1

q2  1

,

6

(20)

(which diers from q2( nn ) by multiplication and shifting by the constants) in the con-
tinuum limit q  1 becomes the ordinary angular momentum operator. therefore it is
natural to consider jq as an appropriate deformation of the latter. of course, discreteness
of values of an angular momentum operator is not peculiar feature of q-deformed systems
but general property of all quantum systems. analogously, the natural q-deformation of
the dilatation operator reads as

dq  [( n + n + 1); q2] =

q2( n +n +1)  1

q2  1

,

(21)

another possibility for the construction of representations of the algebra (17) which
will be convenient for us in the next section is to construct the representation in the basis
of the unitary operators

u  zz1 ,

and

q2( n +n +1) ,

(22)

which commute with each other and, hence, have common eigenvalues. this basis, cer-
tainly, less suitable for construction of a matrix representation of the kind presented above
since the two other (hermitian) operators do not shift an eigenvector of the operators (22)
exactly into another eigenvector. however, this basis proves to be more suitable for the
study of transformations of the states under the coaction of the quantum group eq(2)
which we shall carry out in the section 4.

3 quantum eld theory on p (2)

q as a one-dimensional
lattice theory for an innite set of interacting elds

in this section we shall introduce the scalar 4-eld theory on the noncommutative plane
p (2)
and present it in the form of innite number of interacting partial waves dened on
a one-dimensional lattice.

q

3.1 preliminaries on the spherical eld theory

the starting idea of the spherical eld theory [15] in a usual commutative space-time is
the representation of a d-dimensional euclidean eld theory as a theory for an innite set
of one-dimensional interacting elds. in what follows we shall conne ourselves with the
simplest case of two-dimensional scalar theory. the initial action is quite standard:

s =z d2x "(i )(i) + 2  +

( )2  j   j# .

where (r) is the step-function; in , kn are the modied bessel functions of the rst and
second kind respectively.

the principal aim of the spherical eld theory (sqft) is the development of a
nonperturbative approach to calculations in the standard qft. we are interested in uv-
behaviour of perturbation expansion in the quantum eld theory on the noncommutative
plane (nc-qft) which we are going to present in the form similar to the sqft. thus
to make a comparison, let us rst nd out how the uv-divergences of the ordinary (two-
dimensional, scalar) eld theory reveal themselves in sqft. to this aim, we consider the
tadpole diagram depicted in gure 1. this diagram is proportional to the factor

8

xn =

gn (r, r) =

k|n|(r)i|n|(r)

xn =
xn =1

= k0(r)i0(r) + 2

k|n|(r)i|n|(r) .

(31)

it is seen that the green function gn (r1, r2) for a xed partial wave is not singular at
coinciding arguments: gn (r, r) has well-dened values for any r and n = 0,1,2, ... .
however, the tadpole diagram is still divergent: the divergence appears in the summation
over the angular momentum numbers n.
indeed, let us for simplicity consider small
values of r  1, so that we can use the asymptotic expressions:

in (r)|r1 

kn (r)|r1 

,

1

n!(cid:18)r
2 (cid:19)n

n = 0,1,2, ... ,

,

|n|  1 ,

k0(r)|r1  ln

2

r

,

( is the euler constant) .

thus for r  1 the tadpole is proportional to
2

gn (r, r) = ln

xn =

+

xn =1

1
n   ,

r

so that it is (logarithmically) divergent as it should be. of course, the same is true for
any values of r, though an explicit demonstration of this fact becomes more involved.

in order to circumvent such a calculation with the special (bessel) functions, we can
present the action (26) in a modied form. first, if we are interested only in uv-properties
of the model, we can drop out the mass term. however, the massless theory in two
dimension has the infra-red divergences which are also logarithmic for the tadpole diagram
and may distort the true picture of the uv-behaviour of the model. thus, in the massless
case we need some ir-regularization and to achive it, let us introduce into the (massless)
action (26) the additional term of the form

and, hence, logarithmically divergent. the ir-regularization parameter  is inessetial for
large n and does not inuence on the uv-behaviour of the model (as it should be).

the form (35) of the action and the uv-behaviour analysis following it will be useful
for us in the noncommutative case as well. we are going to show that the 4-theory
on the q-plane can be rewritten as a theory of the partial waves on a one-dimensional
(nonequidistant) lattice with the behaviour in n (angular momentum number) being
even worse, so that uv-divergences of the nc-qft are even more severe than those of
the usual scalar theory.

3.2 quantum eld theory on the q-plane and its partial wave

decomposition

let us consider the generalization of the two-dimensional scalar eld theory, induced by
the noncommutativity (8) of the space coordinates on the plane p (2)
. the eld action for
(z, z) can be dened with the help of the q-deformed haar (invariant) measure [19]. for
a function fn (z, z) = zn f (zz) on p (2)

one denes the linear functional (q-integral):

q

q

d2z zn f (zz)

hr0[fn ]  z q
 n,0r2

0(q2  1)

xk=

q2kf (q2kr2
0)

(39)

(r0 labels the nonequivalent representations (18) of the q-deformed coordinate-momentum
algebra). in formula (39) and in what follows we assume, for deniteness, that q2 > 1 (the
quite similar construction can be carried out for q < 1, cf. (67)). in order that the sum on
the right hand side of (39) be meaningful, the function f (zz) must satisfy an appropriate
conditions at innity [19]. we shall assume that the set of the elds on the q-plane which
we consider below does satisfy this condition. notice that if n < 0 in (39), the integrand
can be rewritten as z|n|f(zz) (f(zz) is some modication of the function f (zz)).

using the q-integral (39), we can dene the action on the q-plane as the straightforward

generalization of the usual 4-action (23):

sq = z q

d2z(cid:20)  (z, z)q q(z, z) + 2 (z, z)(z, z)
2(cid:18) (z, z)(z, z)(cid:19)2

 j(z, z) (z, z)  j(z, z)(z, z)(cid:21) .



+

(40)

10

now our aim is to rewrite the action (40) in the form similar to (26) where the integral over
radial variables is substituted by the sum (39) while the sum over the angular momentum
numbers remains in the q-deformed case too. to achieve this, we decompose a eld on
p (2)
into terms with denite eigenvalues of the q-deformed angular momentum operator
jq (cf. (20)):

q

(z, z) =

zn rn n (r) ,

r2  zz .

(41)

xn =

again, as in the case of the expression (39), it is worth to notice that the terms with
n < 0 in the sum (41) can be rewritten in the form with positive powers of z:

zn rn = q|n|(|n|1)z|n|r|n| = qn (n +1) zn rn ,

(n < 0) .

(42)

here we have used the relation:

zn zn = qn (n1)(zz)n  qn (n1)r2n .

(43)

the next step is the substitution of the decomposition (41) into the action (40) and
then use of the denition (39) to convert the action into a lattice one. in order to do this,
one needs the following commutation relations which are derivable from (8):

zz = qzz ,

zn rn = qn (n1/4) zn/2zn/2 ,

zr = q1rz ,

zr = qrz ,
qz = q1zq ,

qz = qz q ,

qz =

1

q + 1

z

qzn/2 =

[n; q1]
q1 + 1

zn/21 + qn zn/2q ,

qz =

q1 + 1

+ q1zq ,

1
z
+ qz q ,

q zn/2 = 

[n; q1]
q(q + 1)

zn/21 + qn zn/2 q ,

q

qf (r) =

1

2 + q + q1(cid:20)1

r

d(r)

q1rd(r)

q (cid:21) f (r) .

the jackson derivatives in the last line are deed as follows:

d(r)

q1f (r) =

d(r)

q f (r) =

f (q1r)  f (r)

,

r(q1  1)
f (qr)  f (r)

r(q  1)

(44)

(45)

(these denitions imply that we are working with the representation where the operator
r is diagonal).

11

use of these relations together with (39) and (41) allows to present the action (40) in

the form of the jackson integral over the radial variable r2:

sq =

xn =z j
+q2(n +1) [n; q1]2

dr2(qn (n +1) n (r2)(cid:20) 
(q + 1)2r2  qn +1 [n; q1]

(q + 1)2 q

+qn (n +1)jn (r2)n (r2) + qn (n +1) n (r2)jn (r2)) .

(46)

here the jackson integral for and arbitrary function f (r2) is dened in the standard way
(see, e.g., [6]):

z j

dr2 f (r2)

def

 r2

0|q2  1|

xk=

q2kf (q2kr2

0) ,

(47)

and the jackson derivatives are dened by (45) and by the following similar relations:

d(r2)

q2 f (r2) =

d(r2)

q2 f (r2) =

,

f (q2r2)  f (r2)

r2(q2  1)
f (q2r2)  f (r2)

.

(48)

(49)

r2(q2  1)
the radial part q of the q-deformed laplacian reads as

q =

1
r

d(r)

q1rd(r2)

q

.

notice that the expression (46) for the action sq in term of the jackson integral is equally
correct both for the case q > 1 and for q < 1. for deniteness, we continue to discuss
the case q > 1. the consideration for the case q < 1 is essentially the same and we shall
present for it only the result (cf. (67)).

since both the jackson integral and the jakson derivatives turn into their nondeformed
(continuous) counterparts in the limit q  1, it is readily seen that the action (46)
becomes in this limit the usual action (26) for the two-dimensional scalar theory in the
polar coordinates.

now we proceed to study the uv-behaviour of the eld theory on the q-deformed
plane. therefore, we again, similarly to the nondeformed case in the preceding subsection
(cf. (32)), substitue the mass term with the ir-regularizing term

s(ir)

q =

xn =z j

dr2 qn (n +1)2

r2

12

n (r2)n (r2) .

(50)

the exponential dependence of the elds in (46),(47) on the space (discrete) variable k
inspires to make the substitution similar to that for the nondeformed model (cf. (34)) and
to denote:

0) ,

n k  n (q2kr2
jn k  jn (q2kr2
0) ,

0) ,

n k  n (q2kr2
jn k  jn (q2kr2
0) .

in this notation the action (46) in which the mass term is subsituted by (50), acquires
the form of an action for innite number of scalar elds on a one-dimensional lattice:

sq = s(0)

q + s(int)

(57)
it is obvious that an > 0, rn > 0 for all n = 0,1,2, .... this justies the denition
(55) and shows that the quadratic part of the euclidean action (40) is positively dened.
the latter fact, in turn, provides that the generating functional for green functions in
the model with the action (40) (or, in the lattice form, (51)-(53)) given by the innite
dimensional integral (discrete lattice analog of the path integral):

z[j] =

r qn,k d n k dn k exp {s}
r qn,k d n k dn k expn s|j=j=0o ,

can be calculated by the perturbation expansion. a few remarks are in order:

(58)

1. the elds n , n at points q2kr0, k = 0,1,2, ..., i.e., the quantities n k, n k,
can be considered as the creation and annihilation operators of particles on the
quantum plane p (2)
in the states (18). thus the eld model with the action (51) is
the secondary quantized theory of the particles on the quantum q-plane p (2)

2. the quadratic part (52) of the action (51) has the standard form of the lattice
scalar theory (cf. e.g., [20]), so that we can use the standard method of the fourier
transform in order to diagonalize it.

3. as a result of the nonequidistance of the q-lattice, the mass term in (46) (the second
line) looks as if the model interacts with the external eld, i.e., the mass term
contains additional factors q2k under the sign of the sum. this makes diagonalization
of the complete quadratic part of the action (46) rather involved problem.

4. it is rather striking result that the action on the q-plane is not only lattice-like but

also nonlocal, as is seen from the interaction term of the action in the form (53).

together with the 4-vertex of the action (53), this free propagator denes the feyn-
man rules for the model under consideration which are depicted in gure 2. we shall
not carry out detailed perturbative calculations: because of the nonequidistance of the
q-lattice such calculations (especially in the case of nonzero mass) prove to be rather
cumbersome. notice, however, that these peculiarities of the q-lattice seems to be not a
diculty for computer simulations. in this paper we shall demonstrate only that the uv-
divergences retain in the scalar eld theory on the q-deformed plane. let us consider the
tadpole diagrams presented in gure 3. we conne our consideration to the diagram 3.a
because its analysis is a bit easier than that for the diagram 3.b. using the generating
functional (58) and the feynman rules we nd the following expression for the tadpole 3.a:

q4q[(qn  1)2 + (q2  1)22/q4][(qn + 1)2 + (q2  1)22/q4] n
the series has the linear divergence at the lower limit (the ir-regularization parameter
again, as in the nondeformed case, is inessential in the n   limit). notice that in
the nondeformed limit q  1 the series (64) turns into the following one

quite similar calculation in the case q < 1 shows that the tadpole diagram 3.a is

proportional to the series

xn =

thus the perturbation theory for the 4-model on the noncommutative plane p (2)
with the action constructed with the help of the eq(2)quantum group invariant measure
contains the uv-divergences and, hence, can not be considered as a regularization of the
usual scalar eld theory on the commutative plane.

q

under a coaction of the quantum group eq(2).

the central problem of this section is to determine transformation properties of a system
on p (2)
in the subsection 4.1 we shall
clarify a general formulation of this problem and in subsection 4.2 give an explicit an-
swer for eq(2) group. in particular, we shall show that this coaction leads to nonlocal
transformations of states.

4.1 transformation of states in noncommutative geometry in-

duced by a quantum group coaction

let a quantum group gq coact on a noncommutative space xq, i.e.
homomorphic map

there exists the

 : f unq(x )  f unq(g)f unq(x ) ,

(68)
(the algebra f unq(x ) of functions on xq is the conguration space subalgebra of the alge-
bra of all operators of the given quantum system). it is natural to say that the system is in-
variant with respect to the quantum group transformations if all the properties of the sys-
tem are independent on the coaction map . in other words, the algebra f unq(x ) can be
realized as the subalgebra of multiple tensor product f unq(g)f unq(g)...f unq(x )
and no measurements can distinguish the description based on the algebras with dierent
numbers of the factors f unq(g).

at rst sight, this denition of symmetry transformations may look unusual but, in
fact, it is a direct generalization of commutative transformations. indeed, usual action of
a group g of transformations of a manifold m on a function f  f un(m) is dened by
the equality
(69)
the right hand side of this denition can be considered as the function dened on gm.
in other words, the transformations t denes the map

g  g, x  m .

tgf (x) := f (g1x) ,

t : f un(m)  f un(g)f un(m) .

more customary map  : gm  m is dened for points of the manifolds, which
play the role of the dual set of states for the commutative algebra of observables (functions)
on usual manifolds. returning to the transformations with noncommutative parameters,
let us dene the map [21] which is dual to the transformations (68) of observables (oper-
ators), i.e.,

s : hgqhxq  hxq ,

16

(70)

where hgq and hxq are the hilbert spaces of all representations of the algebras f unq(g)
and f unq(x ). the intertwining operator s is implicitly dened by the equation

hha|ii = hha|s(, )ii ,

(71)

where  is arbitrary vector from hg,  is arbitrary vector from hx and s(, )  hx and
the duality relation hha|ii : oho  c between an operator a from some algebra
o and a vector  from the hilbert space ho of the representations of this algebra, is
dened by the ordinary mean value of a in the state  : hha|ii = h|a|i. in fact,
the usual denition (69) of the action of (classical, commutative) transformation groups
in the space of functions on some homogeneous manifold m also has the general form
(71). indeed, in this case the duality relation between the algebra f un(m) and states,
i.e. points of m, is dened as follows
hhf|xii = f (x) ,

f  f un(m), x  m .

the same is true for the group manifold:

hht|gii = tg ,

t  f un(g), g  g .

thus (69) can be represented in the form

hhf|gxii = hhtf|gxii = tgf (x) = hhf|s(g, x)ii = hhf|g1xii = f (g1x) ,
where the third equality follows from (71) and in this special case s(g, x) = g1x.
from (70) it follows that the matrix elements of the operator s in a chosen bases of
hgqhxq and hxq play the role of generalized clebsch-gordan coecients (gcgc). if
the multiple index (set of quantum numbers) {m} denes basis vectors {m} of hxq , and
the set {k} denes basis {k} of hgq, one can write
 = s({k}, {m}) =x{l}

{l} ,

c{k}

{m}{l}

(72)

{m}{l}

where c{k}
are the set of gcgc. in this formula the vector {m} is a transformed state
on the quantum plane, and the vector {k} (analog of a point on a grou manifold in the
case of ordinary lie groups) denes parameters of the trasformation of {m}.

one can apply analogous consideration to the very quantum group gq which coacts

on itself

mi

j = m i

j = m i

this leads to the corresponding transformation of vectors in hgq
c{k}

 = s({k}, {n})  s{k}({n}) =x{l}

{n}{l}

km k
j ,

(73)

(74)

{l} ,

two subsequent coactions of the form (73) induce composition of the transforma-
tions (74) and general properties of algebra representations provide its associativity (or,
equivalently, this follows from the coassociativity of hopf algebras). this means that the
transformations (74) form the semigroup. the trivial representation {0}  hgq corre-
spond to the identity transformation. however, there is no inverse transformation for
arbitrary s{k}. this means that the transformations (74),(72) do not form a group.

the map s satises the obvious consistency condition which can be expressed as a
requirement of commutativity of the diagram in gure 4 (in other words, an equivalence of
the dierent ways through the diagrams along the arrows). for the generalized clebsch-

normalization conditions which follow from the normalization of vectors |ki and |mi.
notice that the equations (75) are an analog of the recursion equations used for deter-
mination of ordinary clebsch-gordan coecients of su(2) group. however, in the case
of quantum groups the problem of explicit solution of these equation proves to be much
more dicult [21].

4.2 representations of the algebra of functions on eq(2) and

transformations of states on p (2)

q

in this subsection we shall be interested in construction of the cotransformations of the
coordinate subalgebra on a quantum plane and therefore, for shortness, drop the quantum
numbers related to the angular momentum jq.

according to the discussion in the preceding subsection, a transformation of a state
on a quantum plane depends on a vector from representation space for the algebra of
functions on the group eq(2). thus we need explicit construction of representations of
the algebra eq(2) (cf. (2)). these representations have been presented in [12]: in slightly
dierent (more physical) form they read as

t = ea ,

t = ea

,

q2 = e ,

v = eie(aa) ,

  [0, 2] ,

where a, a are usual creation and annihilation operators

[a, a] = 1 ,

(76)

(77)

and hence can be represented in any well known way (e.g., coordinate, bargmann-fock,
coherent state, innite matrix representations). the factor ei in (76) is an eigenvalue of

18

the central element i of the algebra eq(2)

(78)
so that dierent values of   [0, 2] separate dierent (though identical) irreducible
representations of the eq(2)-algebra. notice that i is unitary operator ii = 1, that is
why its eigenvalues are parameterized by ei.

i = q1vtt1 ,

for an explicit construction we may use the basis of coherent states

a|i =  |i ,
  ,
h|i = e

  c ,

so that

t|i = e |i ,
t|i = | + i ,
v |i = e/2+ie |  i ,

v = v1 .

(79)

(80)

(81)

the algebra of functions on p (2)

q

generated by z, z has not a central element and its

unique representation has the form (80) where t, t are substituted by z, z.

according to the general discussion in the preceding subsection, the coaction of eq(2)

on p (2)

q

z  z = z  vz + t1i ,
z  z = z  vz + t1i ,

of p (2)
induces transformations of states from the representation space hp (2)
on a state from the representation space heq(2) of the quantum group eq(2):

q

q

|i  |i = s(cid:18)|, i ,|i(cid:19) ,
|, i  heq(2) ,

|i ,|i  hp (2)

q

.

explicitly this map can be written as follows

|i =z d e  |ih|, ; i ,

(82)

depending

(83)

(84)

where the generalized clebsch-gordan coecients for the coaction of eq(2) on p (2)
denoted as

q

are

thus to dene transformations properties of the states on p (2)

(85)
q we should calculate
the gcgc (85). the consistency relation given by the commutativity of the diagram in
gure 5 leads to the set of equations

h|, ; i  h|s|, ; i .

h|, ; i = eh + |, ; i  e/2+ie
h|, ; i = e h|,  + ; i  e/2ie(+ h|,  + ;  + i , (86)

which must be accompanied by normalization conditions. as we mentioned in the pre-
ceding subsection, it is not easy to solve this equations straigthforwardly. to circumevent
the problem it is helpful to consider the basis where the primitive elements v, v  eq(2)
are diagonal. the point is that a cotransformation for primitive elements has the form of
a cotransformation for an ordinary lie algebra, thus the consistency conditions for them
also have a most simple form.

proceeding in this way, let us construct representation in the basis of the primitive
element v. this is easy to do taking into account that in the parameterization (4) the
commutation relations for the eq(2) takes the form

[, 2] = i22 ,
[, 2] = 0,

where we have introduced, in analogy with the algebra p (2)

q

(cf. (16)) the operators:

2  tt ,

2  tt1 .

(87)

(88)

(89)

the only nontrivial commutation relations (87) is equivalent to that for igl(1, ir) lie
algebra (lie algebra of translations and dilatations on a line). representations of this
algebra are well known (see, e.g., [22]) and this allows to write immediately the required
representation with v = ei being diagonal:

vf(x) = eie2ixf(x) ,

2f(x) = eeif(x) ,

2f(x) = e/2e2ixf(x) .

(90)

(91)

from the form of the operators it is clear that the variable x takes values on a circle:
x  [0, 2/]. thus the functions f(x) are dened on the circle and form the hilbert
space with the scalar product

hf1(x), f2(x)i =z 2/

0

dx f1(x)f2(x) .

(92)

the consistency relations (commutativity of the diagram in gure 5) for the generators

t, t result again in still rather complicated recursion relations:

t = vt + t1i



20

hei1e2i(x1+x2)ei2/2 + eix1ei1/2  eixei/2ih, x|1, x1; 2, x2i = 0 ,
t = vt + t1i
hei1e2i(x1+x2)ei2/2 + eix1ei1/2  eixei/2ih, x|1, x1; 2, x2i = 0 .



but the relation for the primitive element v has quite simple form

v = vv
ei(12x1+22x2)h, x|1, x1; 2, x2i = ei(2x)h, x|1, x1; 2, x2i .



(93)

here h, x|1, x1; 2, x2i denotes gcgc for the algebra eq(2) in the realization (90) and
we used the basis |, xi of eigenfunctions of the operator e2ix which are, of course, -
functions on the circle:

|, x0i = (s)(x  x0) =

1

2

xk=

e2ik(xx0) .

(94)

the relation (93) shows that the eigenvalues x1, x2 of vectors in the representations 1
and 2 under the tensor product sign and the eigenvalue x in an irreducible part  of the
resulting representation are connected by the relation

 1 + 2x1  2 + 2x2 =  + 2x + 2n ,

n = 0, 1, 2, ...

(95)

this is the analog of additivity of the magnetic quantum number in the case of su(2) lie
algebra: m = m1 + m2 (m1, m2 are j (1)
3 -eigenvalues of two spins to be summed up
and m is an eigenvalue of j3 = j (1)
3 + j (2)

3 , j (2)
3 ).

let us consider the action of the central operator i on the direct product of two

representations

i |1, x1i|2, x2i .

(96)

acting in addition by the intertwining operator s and denoting

|1, x1; 2, x2i  |1, x1i|2, x2i ,

we have

si |1, x1; 2, x2i = is |1, x1; 2, x2i

= iz d dy |, yih, y|s |1, x1; 2, x2i
= iz d |, yi c(; 1, x1; 2, x2)
= z d ei |, yi c(; 1, x1; 2, x2) ,

where according to (95) we have dened

h, y|s |1, x1; 2, x2i  (s)(cid:16)  1  2 + 2(x1 + x2  y)(cid:17)c(; 1, x1; 2, x2) .

21

(97)

(98)

on the other hand, consider the concrete realization of the operators i and i in
l2(s) and in the tensor product l2(s)l2(s), respectively. to this aim we need an
explicit form of 2 and 2. calculation in the representation (90) gives the result:

2 = 1i2 + 21i + vtt + tvt

= eei(cid:20)eie + eie + ei1e/2eix + ei1e/2eix(cid:21) ,

2 = (cid:18)vt1t + 21i(cid:19)(cid:18)1i1i + vt1t(cid:19)1

= e/2ei(x+ex) 1 + e/2ei1eixeie
1 + e/2ei1eixeie

here we used the change of variables

.

(99)

(100)

(101)

inspired by the equality (95). now we can easily calculate the comultiplication for the
central operator:

x = x1 + x2 ,

ex = x1  x2 ,

i = q1v2

= ei(1+2)eixeiex 1 + e/2ei1eixeie
1 + e/2ei1eixeie

.

(102)

in spite of their rather cumbersome form it is easy to check that the operators 2
in fact, this

and 2 indeed satisfy the commutation relations of the eq(2) algebra.
immediately follows from their general form which can be written as follows

2 = const  eif (x, e) ,
2 = const  ie2ix

(here f (x, e) is a function of only x and e explicit form of which is given in (99)).

it is clear that if we start from some eigenvector of the operator 2

(cf. (90)) then, after the comultiplication, we have

2 |2, x2i = e/2e2ix2 |2, x2i

2 |1, x1i |2, x2i = e/2ei(1+2)e2i(x1+x2)i |1, x1i|2, x2i .

(103)

(104)

since in any irreducible component the central element is proportional to the unity oper-
ator

ip(cid:18)|1, x1i |2, x2i(cid:19) = eip(cid:18)|1, x1i|2, x2i(cid:19)

(105)

(p is a projector onto the irreducible component of the representation space corre-
sponding to the central element eigenvalue ei), the relation (104) shows that for the
-component the eigenvalue of 2 is

e/2ei(12+2x) ,

x = x1 + x2 .

(106)

22

this expression shows how the initial eigenvalue e/2e2ix2 of the operator 2 is trans-
formed under the coaction of e(2)
q with the state |1, x1i dening the parameters of the
transformations (cf. (72), (74)).
the thing which we have to do now is to nd the decomposition of an arbitrary

function f (x1, x2) = f (x,ex)  heq(2)heq(2) into eigenvectors of i, i.e., into irreducible

components. to this aim we must solve the eigenvalue equation

the solution written in terms of the fourier transform

(107)

(108)

(109)

ig(x,ex) = eig(x,ex) .
xk=eg(x, k)eikex ,
g(x,ex) =
eg(x, k) = ei(12+x)keid(x,k) ,

has the form

d(x, k) being dened by the simple recursion relation

where

d(x, k + 1) = d(x, k)  (x, k + 1) ,

d(x, 0) = 0 ,

(110)

ei(x,k) 

1 + e/2ei1eixek
1 + e/2ei1eixek .

(111)

the solution of this recursion is obvious:

d(x, k) =

kxn=1
d(x, k) = 
k+1xn=0
kyn=1
kyn=1

eid(x,k) =

eid(x,k) =

(x, n) ,

k > 0 ,

(x, n) ,

k < 0 ,

1 + e/2ei1eixen
1 + e/2ei1eixen ,

1 + e/2ei1eixen
1 + e/2ei1eixen ,

k > 0 ,

(112)

k < 0 ,

(113)

the solution (109), of course, is not square integrable function but a distribution (like

momentum eigenvectors in ordinary quantum mechanics).

any function f (x, k) can be presented as a fourier integral of the functions g(x, k)

f (x, k) =

=

1

2z d c()g(x, k)
ei(1+1xc(x,k))z d c()g(x, k)eik ,

1
2

c() = xk

ei(1+1xc(x,k))eikf (x, k) .

23

(114)

(115)

if we start from eigenvectors of the operator 2 (in each component of the tensor

product l2(s)l2(s))
f (x,ex)  |1, x1i|2, x2i = (s)(x1  x1)(s)(x2  x2)

1

=

(2)2

xm,n=

ei[m(xx)+n(exex)] ,

x = x1 + x2 , fx = x1  x2

(x1, x2 are the representation variables, while x1, x2 labels eigenvalues of the operator
2: 2(s)(xi  xi) = exp {/2 + 2ixi} (s)(xi  xi)), its decomposition over the eigen-
functions g has the form (114) with the coecients:

c(, x, 1, 2) = (s)(x  x)

thus

i |1, x1i |2, x2i =

xk=
ei(1+2x)k+id(x,k)e2iexk .
2z d eic(, x, 1, 2)g(x,ex) .

(116)

(117)

comparison of (117) and (97) allows to read o the expression for gcgc of the quantum
group eq(2):

h, y|s |1, x1; 2, x2i  (s)(cid:16)  1  2 + 2(x1 + x2  y)(cid:17)c(; 1, x1; 2, x2) ,

c(; 1, x1; 2, x2) = c(, x, 1, 2) ,

(118)

and c(, x, 1, 2) is given by (116) and (112),(113).

the corresponding coaction on vectors on p (2)

q have quite the same form with the only
restriction 2 = 0. now we are ready to answer the question about transformations of
the coordinate operators eigenvalues. the operator u2 = zz1  p (2)
(cf. (16)) has the
eigenvectors similar to those of 2:

q

u2 |x2i = e/2e2ix2 |x2i ,

(119)

after the coaction  by eq(2)-quantum group, we obtain the operator u2 acting on vectors
and with a structure which is quite similar to 2 (cf. (104))
|1, x1i |x2i  heq(2)hp (2)

q

(u2) |1, x1i |x2i = e/2ei1e2i(x1+x2)i |1, x1i |2, x2i .

(120)

this implies that the resulting vector can be decomposed into irreducible parts and,
simultaneously, into vectors with denite values of the coordinate u2 as follows:

(u2) |1, x1i|x2i =

1
2

e/2z d c(, x, 1, 2)ei(1+2x)g(x,ex) .

(121)

the expression (121) presents the form of transformation of position eigenvectors on a
and shows that the coaction of eq(2) induces nonlocal transformations

quantum plane p (2)
of the states.

5 conclusion

we have shown that transition to a noncommutative q-deformed plane does not lead
to an ultraviolet regularization of the scalar 4-quantum eld theory. we start from
the rstly quantized theory of quantum particles on the noncommutative plane. then
we have dened quantum elds depending on noncommutative coordinates and the eld
theoretical action using the quantum analog of the haar (eq(2)-invariant) measure on the
noncommutative plane. with the help of the partial wave decomposition we have shown
that this quantum eld theory can be considered as a second quantization of the particle
theory on the noncommutative plane and that it has (contrary to the common belief)
even more severe ultraviolet divergences than its counterpart on the usual commutative
plane.

induced transformations of the states.

we have discussed symmetry transformations on the noncommutative spaces and the
in the case of lie algebra-like spaces the coor-
and states of the

g

dinates form a tensor operator bxi  bxi = mijbxj + bi = bugbxibu1
eld system are transformed by the operator bug. we considered the example of such

transformations for the case of noncommutative euclidean and minkowski planes in the
preceding paper [10]. in the q-deformed case, we have shown that the quantum group
coaction on a coordinate algebra induces nonlocal transformations of states in the co-
ordinate space. these transformations are dened by the generalized clebsch-gordan
coecients, describing decomposition of tensor products of representations of algebras of
functions on quantum spaces and representations of the corresponding quantum group. in
other words, the coaction puts in correspondence to a pair of states on a group algebra gq
and on a quantum space xq some new state on the quantum space. we have considered
such transformations for the case of the q-deformed plane with the eq(2)-symmetry.
