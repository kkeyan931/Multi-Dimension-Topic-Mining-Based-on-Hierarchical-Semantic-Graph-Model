abstract

we show that the recently formulated equivalence principle implies a basic cocycle condition

both in euclidean and minkowski spaces, which holds in any dimension. this cocycle condition,

that in onedimension is sucient to x the schwarzian equation [6], implies a fundamental

higher dimensional mobius invariance which in turn univocally xes the quantum version of the

hamiltonjacobi equation. this holds also in the relativistic case. we then show that the ep

implies that masses are related by maps induced by the coordinate transformations connecting

dierent physical systems. furthermore, we show that the minimal coupling prescription, and

therefore gauge invariance, arises quite naturally in implementing the ep. finally, we show that

there is an antisymmetric twotensor which underlies quantum mechanics and sheds new light

on the nature of the quantum hamiltonjacobi equation.

1 introduction

the consistent synthesis of the 20th century most important philosophical advances, quan-

tum mechanics (qm) and general relativity (gr), remains elusive. these two theories have

changed the human experience of reality and allowed it to probe into the smallest and largest

possible scales. yet these two pillars of modern science remain incompatible at a fundamental

level, despite enormous eorts devoted to formulating the proper mathematical theory that

will embrace both qm and gr. it also seems that none of the current approaches to quantum

gravity provides a satisfactory resolution. in particular, at the present the issues of the energy

and generation of mass remain unsolved. thus, it is fair to say that at present there does not

exist a proper framework for the consistent formulation of quantum gravity, and what may be

needed is a new paradigm. for example, one usually considers gr as the natural framework

to describe gravitational forces seen as one of the four fundamental forces. on the other hand

qm is seen as the natural framework to describe interactions. so, the current view considers

qm and gr as playing qualitatively rather dierent roles.

our view is going in another direction. namely, suppose that qm and gr are in fact two

facets of the same medal.

if so, then we should need a reformulation of qm and a better

understanding about the nature of gr and of the other interactions. recently, in [1][6], it has

been proposed that qm can follow from an equivalence principle (ep) which is reminiscent of

the einstein ep. this principle requires that it is possible to connect all physical systems by

coordinate transformations. in particular, there should always exist a coordinate transformation

connecting a nontrivial physical system, with a nontrivial potential and energy, to the system

with vanishing and energy. conversely, any allowed physical state should arise by a coordinate

transformation from the state in which the potential and the energy vanish. that is, under

coordinate transformations, the trivial state should transform with an inhomogeneous term into

a nontrivial one.

the above aspects are intimately related with the concept of spacetime. actually, the

removal of the peculiar degeneration arising in the classical concepts of rest frame and time

parameterization is at the heart of the ep [6]. in [2, 6] it was shown that this univocally leads

to the quantum stationary hj equation (qshje). this is a thirdorder nonlinear dierential

equation which provides a trajectory representation of qm. after publishing [1], the authors

became aware that this equation was assumed in [7] as a starting point to formulate a trajectory

interpretation of qm (see also [8]). in [4, 6] it was shown that the trajectories depend on the

planck length through hidden variables which arise as initial conditions. so we see that qm

may in fact need gravity.

1

a property of the formulation is the manifest pq duality, which in turn is a consequence of

the involutive nature of the legendre transformation and of its recently observed relation with

secondorder linear dierential equations [9]. the role of the legendre transformation in qm

is related to the prepotential which appears in expressing the space coordinate in terms of the

wavefunction [10][11][12].

the pq duality is deeply related to the mobius symmetry underlying the ep, which in

turn xes the qshje. this is also at the basis of energy quantization [5, 6]. in particular, the
qshje is dened only if the ratio d/ of a pair of real linearly independent solutions of the
schrodinger equation is a local homeomorphism of the extended real line r = r{} into itself.
this is an important feature as the l2(r) condition, which in the copenhagen formulation is

a consequence of the axiomatic interpretation of the wavefunction, directly follows as a basic
theorem which only uses the geometrical gluing conditions of d/ at q =  as implied by
the ep. in particular, denoting by q (q+) the lowest (highest) q for which v (q)  e changes
sign, we have that [5, 6]

if

v (q)  e  


p 2
p 2

 > 0, q < q,
+ > 0, q > q+,

(1.1)

then w is a local selfhomeomorphism of r if and only if the corresponding se has an l2(r)
solution.

thus, since the qshje is dened if and only if w is a local selfhomeomorphism of r, this
theorem implies that energy quantization directly follows from the qshje itself. thus, we

have that basic characteristics of qm arise by selfconsistency from the ep without further

assumptions.

an important observation is that the equivalence postulate cannot be formulated consis-

tently in cm. the reason being that in cm the state with vanishing potential and energy

remains a xed point under coordinate transformations. thus, in cm it is not possible to

generate all nontrivial states by a coordinate transformation from the trivial state. consis-

tent implementation of the ep requires a modication of cm which univocally leads to qm.

therefore we should modify the classical hj equation by adding a still unknown term q

1

q !2
2m   s0

+ v (q)  e + q(q),

(1.2)

where, in the case in which q = 0, s0 corresponds to the classical hamiltonian characteristic
function, also called reduced action.

2

the precise formulation of the ep is that all physical systems, labeled by the function
w(q)  v (q)  e, with v (q) being the classical potential and e the energy, can be connected
by a coordinate transformation qa  qb = qb(qa), dened by sb
0 (qa). we then have
the transformation properties of w(q)

0(qb) = sa

w a(qa)  w b(qb) = (cid:16)qbqa(cid:17)2

w a(qa) + (qa; qb),

and q(q)

qa(qa)  qb(qb) = (cid:16)qbqa(cid:17)2

qa(qa)  (qa; qb).

from these transformations we obtain the basic cocycle condition

(qa; qc) = (cid:16)qcqb(cid:17)2h(qa; qb)  (qc; qb)i .

in one dimension a key point was the following result [6]

(1.3)

(1.4)

(1.5)

the cocycle condition (1.5) uniquely denes the schwarzian derivative up to a global constant

and a coboundary term.

one may wonder whether the properties of the schwarzian derivative, an intrinsically one

dimensional (possibly complex) object extend to higher dimension. experience with string

theory and cft would indicate that similar peculiar properties are in fact strictly related to

lowdimensional spaces. nevertheless, these are related to the appearance of the qshje, and

so, since the essence of qm manifests itself already in onedimension, one may in fact believe

that the higher dimensional generalization exists. we will in fact show that the basic fact

underlying the construction is that in any dimension the ep implies a mobius symmetry. more

precisely, the ep implies the higher dimensional analogue of the cocycle condition.

one of the main results of the present paper is the proof that the above condition leads, in the

case of the euclidean metric, to an invariance under ddimensional mobius transformations.

in the case of the minkowski metric the relevant invariance is with respect to the (d+1)

dimensional conformal group. this result is also nontrivial from the mathematical point of

view, and may have implications for the higher dimensional dieomorphisms. this mobius

symmetry will then univocally lead to the timedependent schrodinger equation in higher

dimension. remarkably, we will see that the ep in fact implies also the higher dimensional

relativistic quantum hj equation (rqhje) with external potentials. furthermore, while

considering an external potential leads to a mixing between the kinetic and potential part in

deriving the rqhje, this equation is obtained quite naturally once one considers the minimal

coupling prescription.

3

this aspect is a relevant feature of the ep which in fact corresponds to a sort of naturalness.

namely, the right framework to formulate it is the exact one, that is special relativity. so, for

example, the timedependent schrodinger equation is naturally derived as the nonrelativistic

approximation from the rqhje. furthermore, as we will see in the case of the kleingordon

equation in the presence of the electromagnetic eld, the minimal coupling prescription is in fact

the natural one. this indicates that gauge theories are deeply related to the ep. in this context,

it is useful to stress that the standard schrodinger problems one usually considers correspond to

ideal situations. so for example, a potential well cannot be seen as a fundamental interaction.

actually, the schrodinger problems one may consider at the level of fundamental interactions

essentially concern the electromagnetic one. it is then interesting that the schrodinger equation

for minimal coupled potentials naturally follows from the ep as a nonrelativistic limit.

another key ingredient in the one dimensional derivation of qm from the ep was the

following identity involving the schwarzian derivatives

(qs0)2 =

h2
2

({e

2i

h s0, q}  {s0, q}).

(1.6)

again, in the present paper we will nd the generalization of this identity to higher dimensions

and in the relativistic case.

we started the introduction by arguing for the need for a radical new paradigm for qm.

the fact that qm arises from the ep may suggest that masses have a quantum origin. we will

show that indeed this may be the case. the point is that in the relativistic case one has

w =

1
2

mc2,

(1.7)

then we have that mass of a particle is obtained from the state corresponding to w 0  0 and
is due to the inhomogeneous term which arises from coordinate transformations.

another basic feature of the present approach concerns the appearance of a new eld which

underlies qm. this is one of the new points one naturally meets in considering the higher

dimensional generalization of our formulation. as we will see, this eld arise by solving the

continuity equation associated to the qhje. in particular, this equation naturally denes a
(d  2)form which in turn denes an antisymmetric 2tensor.

our paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we set the notation and derive the higher

dimensional cocycle condition. in section 3 we will prove the invariance of the cocycle con-

dition under the ddimensional mobius transformations. in section 4 we derive the higher

dimensional schrodinger equation and discuss a possible connection with the holographic princi-

ple. in section 5 we then discuss the generalization to the relativistic case. we show that in the

4

case of the minkowski metric, the cocycle condition is invariant under the (d+1)dimensional

conformal group. we derive the generalization of our approach for the kleingordon equa-

tion and show how the timedependent nonrelativistic limit correctly reproduces the time

dependent schrodinger equation. in section 6 we discuss the generalization to the case with

a fourvector including covariant derivatives. we discuss the generation of mass in our ap-

proach and the appearance of the hidden antisymmetric tensor eld which underlies quantum

mechanics.

2 ep and cocycle condition

let us consider the case of two physical systems with hamiltons characteristic functions s0
and sv

0 and denote the coordinates of the two systems by q and qv respectively. setting

induces the map

where

sv
0 (qv) = s0(q),

q  qv = v(q),

v = sv 1

0

 s0,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

0

with sv 1
denoting the inverse of sv
0 . this construction is equivalent to say that the map (2.2)
0 = s0  v1, that is s0(q)  sv
0 (qv) = s0(q(qv)). we will
induces the transformation s0  sv
call the maps (2.2) vtransformations. one of the main results in [1][6] was that the reduced
0 (q0) corresponding to the free system with vanishing energy is not a constant but the
action s0
selfdual state

2i

h s 0

0 =

e

q0 + i0
q0  i0

,

(2.4)

with 0, re  6= 0, a complex integration constant. this corresponds to the overlooked zero
mode of the conformal factor in the quantum analogue of the hamiltonjacobi equation [1][2][6].
furthermore, in ref.[1] the function t0(p), dened as the legendre transform of the reduced
action, was introduced

t0(p) =

d

xk=1

qkpk  s0(q),

s0(q) =

d

xk=1

pkqk  t0(p).

(2.5)

while s0(q) is the momentum generating function, its legendre dual t0(p) is the coordinate
generating function

pk =

let us now consider the classical stationary hamiltonjacobi equation (cshje) in d

dimensions

+ w(q) = 0,

w(q)  v (q)  e,

(2.7)

(2.8)

with v (q) the potential and e the energy. we denote by h the space of all possible ws.

in [1] the following equivalence principle has been formulated

for each pair w a,w b  h, there is a vtransformation such that

w a(q)  w av(qv) = w b(qv).

(2.9)

this implies that there always exists the trivializing coordinate q0 for which w(q)  w 0(q0),
where

w 0(q0) = 0.

(2.10)

in particular, since the inverse transformation should exist as well, it is clear that the trivializing

transformation should be locally invertible.

in [1] it has been shown that this principle cannot be consistently implemented in classical

mechanics (cm): this fact is true in any dimension. actually note that the cshje

(qkscl

xk=1

(2.11)

provides a correspondence between w and scl
transformation properties of w induced by that of s0. in particular, since scl v
must satisfy the cshje

q

,

(2.16)

so that the ratio of momenta corresponds to the jacobian of a coordinate transformation. by

(2.11), we have

that for the w 0 state gives

w(q)  w v(qv) = (pv|p)w(q),

w 0(q0)  w v(qv) = (pv|p0)w 0(q0) = 0.

thus we have [1]

(2.17)

(2.18)

w states transform as quadratic dierentials under classical vmaps. it follows that w 0 is a
xed point in h. equivalently, in cm the space h cannot be reduced to a point upon factorization
by the classical vtransformations. hence, the ep (2.9) cannot be consistently implemented in

cm.

it is therefore clear that in order to implement the ep we have to deform the cshje. as

we will see, this requirement will determine the equation for s0 in any dimension.

let us discuss its general form. first of all observe that adding a constant to s0 does not
change the dynamics. actually, eqs.(2.5)(2.6) are unchanged upon adding a constant to either
s0 or t0. then, the most general dierential equation s0 should satisfy has the structure

let us write down eq.(2.19) in the general form

f (s0, s0, . . .) = 0.

d

xk=1

(ks0(q))2 + w(q) + q(q) = 0.

(2.19)

(2.20)

the transformation properties of w + q under the vmaps (2.2) are determined by the trans-
formed equation

1
2m

d

xk=1

(ksv

0 (qv))2/2m + w v(qv) + qv(qv) = 0,

which by (2.1) and (2.20) yields

w v(qv) + qv(qv) = (pv|p) (w(q) + q(q)) .

(2.21)

(2.22)

a basic guidance in deriving the dierential equation for s0 is that in some limit it should
reduce to the cshje. in [1][2] it was shown that the parameter which selects the classical phase

7

is the planck constant. therefore, in determining the structure of the q term we have to take

into account that in the classical limit

lim
h0

q = 0.

(2.23)

the only possibility to reach any other state w v 6= 0 starting from w 0 is that it transforms
with an inhomogeneous term. namely as w 0  w v(qv) 6= 0, by (2.22) it follows that for an
arbitrary w a state

w v(qv) = (pv|pa)w a(qa) + (qa; qv),

and

qv(qv) = (pv|pa)qa(qa)  (qa; qv).

setting w a = w 0 in eq.(2.24) yields

w v(qv) = (q0; qv),

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

so that, according to the ep (2.9), all the states correspond to the inhomogeneous part in the
transformation of the w 0 state induced by some vmap.

let us denote by a, b, c, . . . dierent vtransformations. comparing

w b(qb) = (pb|pa)w a(qa) + (qa; qb) = (q0; qb),

with the same formula with qa and qb interchanged we have

(qb; qa) = (pa|pb)(qa; qb),

(q; q) = 0.

in particular

more generally, comparing

(2.27)

(2.28)

(2.29)

w b(qb) = (pb|pc)w c(qc) + (qc; qb) = (pb|pa)w a(qa) + (pb|pc)(qa; qc) + (qc; qb),

(2.30)

with (2.27) we obtain the basic cocycle condition

(qa; qc) = (pc|pb)h(qa; qb)  (qc; qb)i ,

(2.31)

which expresses the essence of the ep.

8

3 (qa; qb) and the higher dimensional mobius group

in this section, we will show that (qa; qb) vanishes identically if qa and qb are related by a

mobius transformation. this is a consequence of eqs.(2.19) and (2.31) and generalizes the
onedimensional result obtained in [1][2][6], which states that (qb; qa) = 0 if and only if qb is a
linear fractional transformation of qa

qb =

aqa + b
cqa + d

,

ad  bc 6= 0.

(3.1)

as in the one dimensional case, the mobius symmetry will x the qterm in eq.(2.20). before

going into the details of the proof, we will give a brief overview of the mobius group (see, for

example, [13]).

3.1 higher dimensional mobius group

let us denote by q = (q1,   , qd) an arbitrary point in rd. a similarity is the ane mapping
(3.2)

q  mq + b,

where b  rd and the matrix m = a is the composition of a dilatation

q  aq,

a  r,

(3.3)

and a rotation

(3.4)
where   o(d). similarities are naturally extended to the compactied space rd = rd{}.
a similarity maps  to itself.

q  q,

let us consider the hyperplane

p (a, t) = { q  rd|q  a = t, a  rd, t  r}.

the reection with respect to p (a, t) is given by

let us set

f (q) = q  2(cid:18)q  a  t

a  a (cid:19) a.

r2 = q2

1 +    + q2
d.

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

the last generator of the mobius group is the inversion or reection in the unit sphere sd1.
if q 6= 0

(3.8)

q  q =

r2 ,

otherwise

0  ,

  0.

(3.9)

the mobius group m( rd) is dened as the set of transformations generated by all simi-
larities together with the inversion. actually, an arbitrary mobius transformation is the com-

position of a number of reections and inversions. furthermore, a mobius transformation is

conformal with respect to the euclidean metric and a theorem due to liouville states that the
conformal group and m( rd) actually coincide for d > 2.

3.2 translations and dilatations

we now begin to study the properties of (qb; qa) when qb and qa are related by dilatations and

translations. let us start by noticing that from (2.31) we have

(q + b + c; q) = (q + b + c; q + b) + (q + b; q) = (q + b + c; q + c) + (q + c; q),

(3.10)

so that

(q + b + c; q + b)  (q + b + c; q + c) = (q + c; q)  (q + b; q),

(3.11)

where (q + b)k = qk + bk, k = 1, . . . , d. we will show that the unique solution of (3.11) is

(q + b; q) = f (q + b)  f (q),

(3.12)

where f is an arbitrary function of q. pick j  [1, d] and let bj and cj be the only non
vanishing components of b and c

b = (0, . . . , bj, 0, . . .),

c = (0, . . . , cj, 0, . . .).

let us set

with b given by (3.13). eq.(3.11) reads

f (b, q) = (q + b; q),

f (c, q + b)  f (b, q + c) = f (c, q)  f (b, q).

taking the derivative of both sides of eq.(3.15) with respect to bj, we get

qj f (c, q + b)  bj f (b, q + c) = bj f (b, q).

by (2.29)

f (b, q) =

cn(q)bn
j .



xn=1

10

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

ncn(q + c)bn1

j =

furthermore, expanding cn(q + b) and cn(q + c), it follows by eq.(3.18) that

j =

qj c1(q)bn

j = c1(q + b)  c1(q),

(3.21)

which upon integration on qj yields

f (b, q) = c(q + b)  c(q) + g(b, q),

(3.22)

with q denoting all the variables other than qj. moreover, by (2.29) g(0, q) = 0. let us show
that g(b, q) is identically vanishing. by (2.31)

f (b + c, q) = (q + b + c; q) = (q + b + c; q + b) + (q + b; q) = f (c, q + b) + f (b, q), (3.23)

that by (3.22) implies

g(b + c, q) = g(b, q) + g(c, q),

(3.24)

that is g(b, q) = g(0, q)bj. however, by (3.17)(3.21) and (3.22)

bj f (b, q) = qj c(q + b) + g(0, q) = c1(q + b) + g(0, q) =

ncn(q)bn1

j

.

(3.25)



xn=1

then, setting bj = 0, we nd from the last equality that g(0, q) = 0. finally, we are left with

let us dene

f (b, q) = c(q + b)  c(q).

g(d, q) = (q + d; q),

(3.26)

(3.27)

where d is an arbitrary vector. in terms of g(d, q), eq.(3.11) yields

g(d, q + b)  c(q + b + d) + c(q + d) = g(d, q)  c(q + b) + c(q).

(3.28)

11

taking the derivative of both sides of eq.(3.28) with respect to bj, we get

qj g(d, q + b)  qj c(q + b + d) = qj c(q + b).

after setting bj = 0 and integrating

g(d, q) = c(q + d)  c(q) + g(d, q),

(3.29)

(3.30)

where, as before, by q we denote all the components of q other than qj, and, by eq.(3.26),
g(d, q) vanishes if all the components of d other than dj are zero. furthermore, plugging
eq.(3.30) into eq.(3.10), we realize that g(d, q) shares the same properties as g(d, q). there-
fore, the analogue of eq.(3.30) holds for g(d, q) as well. hence, applying this reasoning recur-
sively we end up with

where h(d) vanishes whenever only one component of d is not zero. however, by (3.10), we

(q + d; q) = f (q + d)  f (q) + h(d),

(3.31)

nd that h is linear

which implies

(3.33)

(3.34)

(3.35)

(3.36)

let us analyze the consequences of (3.35) on h(a, q) = (aq, q). by (2.31) and noting that

(p|pa) = a2, we have

(a(q + b); q) = (a(q + b); q + b) + (q + b; q) = a2(aq + ab; aq) + (aq; q),

(3.37)

which is equivalent to

h(a, q + b)  h(a, q) = a2[f (aq + ab)  f (aq)]  f (q + b) + f (q),

(3.38)

12

where now b is an arbitrary vector. taking the derivative with respect to bj

qj h(a, q + b) = a3qj f (aq + ab)  qj f (q + b),

and setting b = 0 we nd

that upon integration yields

qj h(a, q) = a3qj f (aq)  qj f (q),

h(a, q) = a2f (aq)  f (q) + g(a).

(3.39)

(3.40)

(3.41)

a useful observation is that h(a, q) = (aq; q) evaluated at q = 0 cannot depend on a, so that

h(a, 0) = h(1, 0) = 0. therefore

g(a) = (a2  1)f (0),

(3.42)

and h(a, q) = a2(f (aq)f (0))(f (q)f (0)), that, upon the relabeling f (q)  f (q)f (0),
reads

where now

(aq; q) = a2f (aq)  f (q),

f (0) = 0.

(3.43)

(3.44)

note that this xes the ambiguity (3.36).

3.3 rotations

let us consider (q; q), where   o(d). first of all, if qb = qa, we see that (pb|pa) = 1,
because t = t = 1d. hence, by (2.31)

((q + b); q + b) = (q + b; q + b) = (q + b; q) + (q; q + b) =

(q + b; q) + (q; q) + (q; q + b),

(3.45)

which implies

((q + b); q + b)  (q; q) = f ((q + b))  f (q) + f (q)  f (q + b).

(3.46)

therefore, (q; q) = f (q)f (q) + c. however, since (q; q) evaluated at q = 0 cannot depend
on , we have (q; q)q=0 = (q; q)q=0 = (q; q) = 0. then

(q; q) = f (q)  f (q).

(q; q)|q=q0 = 0.

by (2.31)

on the other hand, by (2.31) and (3.54)

((aq); q) = (p|pa)((aq); aq) + (aq; q).

((aq); q) = (a1q; q) = (p|p)(a1q; q) + (q; q),

14

so that

and by (3.43)

a2((aq); aq) + (aq; q) = r4(a1q; q) + (q; q),

(3.59)

a2((aq); aq) + a2f (aq)  f (q) =

1
r4 [a2f (a1q)  f (q)] + (q; q).

(3.60)

picking a q0 such that q

0 = q0 and noticing that r0 = 1, we have by (3.56) and (3.60) that

((aq0); aq0) = a4f (a1q0)  f (aq0).

(3.61)

now observe that any q can be expressed as aq0, where a = r and with q0 a suitable solution
of q = q. furthermore, by (3.54) we have a1q0 = (aq0), so that (3.61) is equivalent to

(q; q) =

1
r4 f (q)  f (q).

(3.62)

3.5 fixing the coboundary

let us denote by (q) a mobius transformation of q. by (3.35)(3.43)(3.47) and (3.62) we have

((q); q) = (p|p)f ((q))  f (q).

(3.63)

given a function f (q), we have that if (f (q); q) satises the cocycle condition (2.31), then this

is still satised under the substitution

(f (q); q)  (f (q); q) + (p|pf )g(f (q))  g(q),

(3.64)

where g has to satisfy the condition g(0) = 0. this condition is a consequence of the fact

that (aq; q) evaluated at q = 0 is independent of a, so that it vanishes at q = 0. therefore,
if (aq; q) satises (2.31), then also (aq; q) + a2g(aq)  g(q) should vanish at q = 0, implying
that g(0)(a2  1) = 0, that is g(0) = 0. the term (p|pf )g(f (q))  g(q) can be seen as a
coboundary term. we now show how the coboundary ambiguity (3.64) is xed. first of all

observe that (2.1) implies

s0
0 (q0) = s0(q),

(3.65)

0 denotes the reduced action associated to the w 0  0 state. on the other hand, by

where s0
(2.26) we have that the equation of motion for s0(q) we are looking for is

(q0; q) = w(q).

(3.66)

comparing (3.66) with (2.19) and (3.65) we see that a necessary condition to satisfy (2.19) is
that (q0; q) depends only on the rst and higher derivatives of q0. in fact, by (3.65) we have

15

0

1  s0(q), that is q0 is a functional of s0. therefore, a possible dependence of (q0; q)
q0 = s0
on q0 itself, would imply that (3.66) has the form f (s0,s0, s0, . . .) = 0 rather than (2.19).
therefore, the only possibility is that the function f in (3.63) be vanishing

f = 0.

(3.67)

therefore, we arrived at the following basic result

eq.(2.19) and the cocycle condition (2.31) imply that (qa; qb) vanishes when qa and qb are related

by a mobius transformation, that is

(q + b; q) = 0,

(aq; q) = 0,

(q; q) = 0,

(q; q) = 0.

the above equations are equivalent to ((q); q) = 0. furthermore, by (2.31) we have

((qa); qb) = (qa; qb),

(qa; (qb)) = (p(b)|pb)(qa; qb).

(3.68)

(3.69)

(3.70)

(3.71)

(3.72)

let us consider the jacobian factor (p(b)|pb). first of all observe that the mobius transformation
is conformal with respect to the euclidean metric. namely, we have

ds2 =

xj=1

d(q)jd(q)j =

d

xj,k,l=1

(q)j

ql

dqkdql =

xj=1

e (q)dqjdqj.

(3.73)

therefore

(p(b)|pb) = e (qb).

(3.74)

note that in the case of translations and rotations the conformal rescaling is the identity. for
dilatations exp a = a2, whereas for the inversion exp  = r4.
note that the above conformal structure arises by setting sv

0 (qv) = s0(q). let us make clear
0 (qv) = s0(q) would
that this is not an assumption. any transformation we choose other than sv
0 (qv) = s0(q)
yield the same results.
results from the fact that q and qv represent the spatial coordinates in their own systems. so,
sv
0 (qv) = s0(q) can be seen just as the simplest way to set the coordinate transformations from
the system with reduced action sv
0 (since physics is determined by the functional structure of
sv
0 , we can denote the coordinate as we like) to the one with reduced action s0. nevertheless,

in particular, the absence of assumptions in setting sv

16

0 (qv) = s0(q) actually
there is a hidden apparently innocuous assumption: that the position sv
makes sense. this is not the case in cm, as for the free particle of vanishing energy we have
s0(q) = cnst.
welldened for any system is essentially the same as imposing the ep. however, on the one

in this case the above position does not make sense. requiring that this is

hand we have seen that the existence of the transformation implies the conformal structure, on

the other we will see that the ep, and therefore existence of the transformation, implies qm.
thus, we have that the mobius group, that for d  3 coincides with the conformal group, is
intimately related to qm itself.

4 the schrodinger equation

in this section, we will derive the quantum hamiltonjacobi equation in d dimensions and

then show that the latter is equivalent to the stationary schrodinger equation.

let us start with the quantum stationary hj equation (qshje) in one dimension

1

q !2
2m   s0

+ v (q)  e +

h2
4m{s0, q} = 0.

(4.1)

this equation was univocally derived from the ep in [1][2]. after publishing [1], the authors

became aware that this equation was assumed in [7] as a starting point to formulate a trajectory

interpretation of qm. in particular, floyd [7] introduced the concept of trajectories by using

jacobis theorem according to which

t  t0 =

s0
e

,

(4.2)

from which one sees that the conjugate momentum p = qs0 does not in general correspond to
the mechanical one, that is p 6= m q. this is a basic dierence with respect to bohms theory
s0 does not work in
[14][18]. furthermore, floyd noted that bohms assumption  = re
this case [7]. apparently one may infer that (4.1) is equivalent to the standard version of the

which is equivalent to

{ s0, q} = 2

(4.6)
so that s0 would satisfy the same equation as s0. nevertheless, there is a problem in the above
derivation. namely, in bohms assumption, like in the usual formulation of quantum hj theory,
s0, but
s0. thus, suppose that the wavefunction describes a bound
between the wavefunction and re
state so that it must be proportional to a real function.1 according to bohm and the usual
approach, this would imply2

the identication is not between a general solution of the schrodinger equation and re

i

s0 is a constant f or bound states.

this in turn implies rather peculiar properties. for example, quantum mechanically the con-

jugate momentum is vanishing for bound states. this seems to be an unsatisfactory feature of

(4.3)(4.4). to be more precise, eqs.(4.3)(4.4) are good equations, unless one forces the identi-
s0 should be identied with a linear
combination of two linearly independent solutions of the schrodinger equation. so, the general

expression for the wavefunction would be

(4.7)

so that there is no trace of the condition s0 = cnst that one would have for bound states, as
   gives

|a| = |b|.

(4.8)
let us note that whereas s0 = cnst would be consistent in the case of classically forbidden
0 = cnst,3 problems arise in regions which are not classically forbidden,
regions, as there scl
0 6= cnst. for example, in the case of the harmonic oscillator, one has s0 = cnst
i.e. where scl
q  r, which follows by identifying r exp(i s0/h) with the wavefunction, while in some region
one has scl
0 6= cnst. as a consequence, while quantum mechanically the particle would be at
rest, after taking the h  0 limit, the particle should start moving. we refer to hollands
book [15] for an interesting analysis concerning the classical limit of the harmonic oscillator in

bohmian theory.

1this is a consequence of reality of w as this implies that if  solves the schrodinger equation, then this
is the case also of . if  6 , then      = cnst 6= 0, so that  is never vanishing. in particular, if
  l2(r), then    (see also sections 14 and 17 of ref.[6]).

2to be precise, bound states would correspond to s0 = cnst outside the nodes of the wavefunction.
3note also that having s0 = cnst in the classically forbidden regions would imply a trivial trajectory, since

p = 0 there.

18

the above analysis can be summarized by the following basic fact

if s0 is the quantum analogue of the reduced action, and therefore reduces to the classical one
in the h  0 limit, then the wavefunction cannot be generally identied with r exp(i s0/h). in
particular, this cannot be the case for bound states, such as the harmonic oscillator, in which

the wavefunction is proportional to a real function also in regions which are not classically

forbidden.

however, we have seen that if r exp(i s0/h) is not identied with real solutions of the
schrodinger equation, then we have equivalence between (4.1) and (4.3)(4.4). we also note
that with the formulation (4.1) one directly sees that the situation s0 = cnst can never occur.
in fact, one has rather stringent conditions connected with the existence of {s0, q}, which in
turn reects the basic nature of the cocycle condition and therefore of the ep. in this respect we
recall that existence of {s0, q} implies that the ratio of two real linearly independent solutions
of the schrodinger equation must be a local selfhomeomorphism of the extended real line
r = r  {}. this is a basic fact as it implies energy quantization without any assumption
[5][6].

4.1 hidden variables, planck length and holographic principle

the above remarks are related to the proposal of changing the bohmian denition of mechanical

momentum m q [18]. this proposal is related to the fact that (4.3)(4.4) allow a rearrangement
of s0 and r. on the other hand, these symmetries are particularly evident working directly
with eq.(4.1), which in turn is equivalent to the schwarzian equation

in fact these symmetries correspond to the invariance of (4.9) under mobius transformations

(4.11)

observe that the condition 1 6= 0 is equivalent to having s0 6= cnst which is a necessary
condition to dene {s0, q} in the qshje.

a basic feature of (4.10) is that it explicitly shows the existence of mobius states [1][6],

called microstates by floyd [7]. in particular, the constants 1 and 2 correspond, together with
, to the initial conditions of eq.(4.1). these initial conditions do not appear in the schrodinger

equation, so that 1 and 2 can be seen as a sort of hidden variables. their role is quite basic.
in particular, it has been shown in [4][6] that in order to have a welldened classical limit, 

should depend on fundamental lengths which in turn should depend on h. this dependence
arises in considering the e  0 and h  0 limits. in particular, let us consider the conjugate
momentum in the case of the free particle with energy e

where k = 2me/h. the rst condition is that in the h  0 limit the conjugate momentum

reduces to the classical one

h(e + e)

pe = 

2|k1 sin kq  ie cos kq|2 ,

2me.

pe = 

lim
h0

on the other hand, we should also have

lim
e0

pe = p0 = 

h(0 + 0)
2|q  i0|2 .

eqs.(4.12)(4.13) show that, due to the factor h in cos kq, the quantity e should depend on

e. let us set

e = k1f (e, h) + e,

(4.15)

where, since e is still arbitrary, we can choose the dimensionless function f to be real. by
(4.12) we have

pe = 

2mef (e, h) + me(e + e)/h
|eikq + (f (e, h)  1 + ek) cos kq|2 .

note that if one ignores e and sets e = 0, then by (4.13)

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.16)

(4.17)

lim
h0

f (e, h) = 1.

we now consider the properties that e and f should have in order that (4.17) be satised in
the physical case in which e is arbitrary but for the condition re e 6= 0, as required by the
existence of the qshje. first of all note that cancellation of the divergent term e1/2 in

pe



e0 

2h2(2me)1/2f (e, h) + h(e + e)
2|q  ih(2me)1/2f (e, h)  ie|2 ,

(4.18)

20

yields

lim
e0

e1/2f (e, h) = 0,

(4.19)

so that k must enter in the expression of f (e, h). since f is a dimensionless constant, we

need at least one more constant with the dimension of length. two fundamental lengths one

can consider are the compton length c = h/mc, and the planck length p = qhg/c3. two

dimensionless quantities depending on e are

and

xc = kc = s 2e
mc2 ,

xp = kp = s 2meg

hc3

.

(4.20)

(4.21)

on the other hand, since xc does not depend on h it cannot be used to satisfy (4.17), so that
it is natural to consider f as a function of xp. let us set

f (e, h) = e(x1
p ),

(4.22)

p ) = pk1 kxk

where (x1
coecients k. in order to consider the structure of e, we note that although e(x1
the e1/2 divergent term, we still have some conditions to be satised. to see this note that

p . the conditions (4.17)(4.19) correspond to conditions on the

pe =

(4.25)

(4.26)

(4.27)

(4.28)

we have that the eect on p0 of a shift of im 0 is equivalent to a shift of the coordinate.
therefore, in considering (4.27) we can set im 0 = 0 and distinguish the cases q0 6= 0 and
q0 = 0. note that as we always have re 0 6= 0, it follows that the denominator in the right
hand side of (4.28) is never vanishing. let us dene  by

(4.30)

(4.31)

a constant length having powers of h can be constructed by means of c and p. we also note
that a constant length which is independent of h is provided by e = e2/mc2 where e is the
electric charge. thus 0 can be considered as a suitable function of c, p and e satisfying the
constraint (4.31).

the above investigation indicates that a natural way to express e is given by

e = e(xp)0,

(4.32)

where (xp) = pk1 kxk

p. any possible choice of (xp) should satisfy the conditions (4.24) and

(4.26). for example, for the modulus e built with (xp) = 1xp, one should have 1 > 0.

summarizing, by (4.15)(4.22)(4.26) and (4.32) we have

e = k1e(x1

p ) + e(xp)0,

(4.33)

where 0 = 0(c, p, e), and for the conjugate momentum of the state w = e we have

pe =

(4.34)

we stress that the appearance of the planck length is strictly related to pq duality and
to the existence of the legendre transformation of s0 for any state. this pq duality has
a counterpart in the d duality [1][6] which sets a length scale that already appears in
considering linear combinations of d0
= q0 and 0 = 1. this aspect is related to the fact that
we always have s0 6= cnst and s0 6 q + cnst, so that also for the states w 0 and w = e one
has a nonconstant conjugate momentum. in particular, the planck length naturally emerges
in considering lime0 pe = p0, together with the analysis of the h  0 limit of both pe and
p0. as a result the compton length and e appear as well.

22

we also note that in [2][6] it has been shown that the wavefunction remains invariant under

suitable transformations of  and . these transformations constitute the basic symmetry group

of the wavefunction. to see this we consider the case of the wavefunction e corresponding
to a state of energy e. since e solves the schrodinger equation, for any xed set of integration
constants  and , there are coecients a and b such that

e{} =

1

0{} (cid:16)ae i
qs

h s0{} + be

i

h s0{}(cid:17) .

(4.35)

performing a transformation of the moduli    = {, }, we have (we refer to [2][6] for
notation)

e{} =  

2i

hqs0!1/2

ha d + bb + (ac + ba)s0i .

requiring that e{} remains unchanged up to some multiplicative constant c, that is

we have by (4.36)

e{}  e{} = ce{},

a2b + aba = aba + b2b.

(4.36)

(4.37)

(4.38)

this denes the symmetry group of the wavefunction. thus, we have seen that there are hidden

variables depending on the planck length and that these can be suitably changed without any

eect on the wavefunction. therefore, we can say that there is a sort of information loss in

considering the wavefunction. so, the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction seems

due to our ignorance about planck scale physics.

the above analysis can be summarized as follows

1. qm follows from the ep[1][6]. the formulation is strictly related to pq duality, which

in turn is a consequence of the involutive nature of the legendre transformation.

in

this context qm is described in terms of trajectories where, according to floyd [7], time

parameterization is dened by jacobis theorem.

2. the theory shows the existence of mobius states [1][6], called microstates by floyd [7].

these states cannot be seen in the framework of ordinary qm. in particular, these states

appear in the context of the quantum hj equation whose initial conditions depend on

the planck length [4][6]. furthermore, from the symmetries of the wavefunction under

change of hidden variables, we explicitly see that there are equivalence classes of the

moduli  which correspond to the same wavefunction [2][6].

23

3. the role of pq duality is a fundamental one.

in fact, this reects in the appearance

in the formulation of a pair of real linearly independent solutions of the schrodinger
equation. so there is a d duality [1][6] which reects the basic mobius symmetry

and therefore the existence of mobius states. this directly shows that in considering
solutions of the basic schrodinger equation 2
q 0 = 0, one has to introduce a length to
consider linear combinations of d0
= q0 and 0 = 1. since in this case w  v  e = 0,
the schrodinger problem does not provide any scale, so that we are forced to introduce a

universal length.

4. implementation of the ep implies that the trivializing map, expressed as the mobius
transform of d/, must be a local selfhomeomorphism of r [1][6]. this in turn im-
plies that for suitable ws the corresponding schrodinger equation must admit an l2(r)
solution [5][6]. this implies that the ep itself implies energy quantization. so basic facts

of qm, such as tunnelling and energy quantization, are derived without axiomatic assump-

tions concerning the interpretation of the wavefunction. furthermore, the appearance
of the l2(r) condition shows that the hilbert space structure starts emerging.

the above shortly summarizes some of the main aspects of the theory. in this context we

note that the appearance of planck length in hidden variables has been recently advocated by

t hooft [19]. t hooft argues that such hidden variables must play a role in the implementation

of the holographic principle [20]. in t hoofts paper it is also argued that due to information

loss, planck scale degrees of freedom must be combined into equivalence classes. the presence

of equivalence classes moduli , corresponding to symmetries of the wavefunction, seems to be
a possible framework for t hoofts proposal4.

4.2 the higher dimensional case

let us now consider the problem of nding the equation for s0 in the higher dimensional case.
to this end, let us rst consider a potential of the form

so that

v (q) =

vk(qk),

d

xk=1

d

w(q) =

xk=1wk(qk),

(4.39)

(4.40)

4we observe that in an interesting paper, floyd has recently considered related issues [21].

in this case, since

we have

and

wk(qk) = vk(qk)  ek.

xk=1

qk(qk),

qk(qk) =

h2
4m{s0,k(qk), qk}.

(4.43)

(4.44)

(4.45)

note that by (2.24)(2.25)(3.68) and (3.70), both w(q) and q(q) are invariant under rotations
and translations

w(q) = w(q(q)),

q(q) = q(q(q)),

q = q + b.

(4.46)

however, observe that

q(q) = q(q(q)) =

h2
4m

d

xk=1{s0(q), qk} =

h2
4m

d

xk=1{ s0(q), qk(q)} 6=

h2
4m

d

xk=1{ s0(q), qk}.

(4.47)

this means that expressing q(q) in terms of sums of schwarzian derivatives does not provide a

convenient, i.e. covariant, formulation. in the following, we will express the quantum potential

q, and consequently the qshje in a way that makes this invariance manifest. first of all,

note that any qk can be written as

qk(qk) = 

h2
2m

krk

rk

,

k(r2

kks0,k(qk)) = 0.

(4.48)

in fact, as we have seen above, since the implementation of the ep implies that s0 is never a
constant, we have (4.6). therefore, we have

q(q) =

xk=1

qk(qk) =

where s0(q) = pd

k=1 s0,k(qk). now consider the following basic identity, which generalizes the

2(s0)2 =

r2  (r2s0),

(4.51)

which holds for any constant  and any functions r and s0. then, if r satises the continuity

comparing eq.(4.43) and (4.49) with eq.(4.53) we can make the following identication

(4.52)

(4.53)

(4.54)

(4.55)

let us now consider an arbitrary state, not necessarily corresponding to a w of the kind
(4.40), with some reduced action s0. we consider r solution of (4.52). note that, as (4.51)
is independent of the form of w, we have that (4.53) holds for arbitrary s0 and r satisfying
(4.52). we now start showing that (4.55) holds in general, not only in the case (4.40).

let us set

w(q) =

h2
2m

eqs.(2.20)(4.53) and (4.56) imply

(re

+ g(q).

q(q) = 

h2

r
r  g(q).

(4.56)

(4.57)

we have seen in (4.46) that the system described by s0(q), where q = q + b, has the
important property that w(q) = w(q(q)) and q(q) = q(q(q)). furthermore, using s0(q) =
s0(q), we nd

  ( r2(q)  s0(q)) =   ( r2(q(q))s0(q)) = 0.

(4.58)
now observe that the continuity equation implies that r2(q(q))s0(q) is the curl of some
vector. in general we have r2is0 =  i2...id
i2fi3...id , where f is a (d  2)form. later we will
exploit the eld f .

i

26

therefore r2(q(q))s0(q) must be a vector. on the other hand, since also s0 is a vector,

we have that r(q(q)) must be a scalar under rotations and translations

r(q) = r(q(q)).

in agreement with the fact that   (r2(q)s0(q)) = 0. therefore, we have

g(q) = 

h2
2m

 r
r  q(q) = 

h2
2m

r
r  q(q) = g(q),

(4.59)

(4.60)

that is g is scalar under rotations and translations. this implies that g may depend only on
s0, (s0)2, r, r and (r)2 and higher derivatives which are invariant under rotations
and translations. on the other hand, another condition is that if w = pd
k=1 wk(qk), then by
eq.(4.49), g = 0. these two requirements imply that g is identically vanishing for all systems

therefore, we have the basic result that the ep actually implies that in any dimension the

reduced action satises the qshje

g = 0.

(4.61)

and the continuity equation

1
2m

(s0)2 + w

  (r2s0) = 0.

this equation implies the ddimensional schrodinger equation

(4.62)

(4.63)

(4.64)

we stress that also in the higher dimensional case there is a fundamental dierence between

the correspondence (4.62)(4.63) and (4.64) and the one usually considered in the literature.
h s0 cannot be identied

namely, we have seen in the onedimensional case that in general re

i

with the wavefunction. in particular, this would cause trouble in the case of bound states, as
s0 would be a constant and inconsistencies arise in the classical limit. this was also evident
from the fact that {s0, q} is not dened for s0 = cnst. in the higher dimensional case, this
would lead to the degeneration of the continuity equation (4.63), with (4.62) resulting in

h2

w =

(4.65)

that in the classical limit, that by denition corresponds to q = 0, would lead to the contra-

diction

therefore, we have

the general relationship between the wavefunction, r and s0 has the form

in particular, for bound states we have

|a| = |b|.

furthermore, s0 is never a constant.

finally, we note that by eqs.(2.25) and (4.55)

inversion ii

rb(qb) and ra(qa) are related in a simple fashion in the case of rotations, reections, dilatations
and translations. namely, ra(qa) solves the continuity equation in the qasystem if and only
if ra(qa(qb)) solves the continuity equation in the qbsystem. thus, as we already proved in
section 3, we explicitly verify by (4.69) that (qa; qb) vanishes identically in such cases. the

analogous relation for the inversion is

r(q) = rd2r(q) =

1

rd2


r(q(q)).

(4.70)

basically, we will show that, given a solution r(q) of the continuity equation in the qsystem,
r(q) in eq.(4.70) solves the continuity equation in the qsystem. then, we will verify that
(q; q) = 0, as we proved in section 3 as a direct consequence of the ep.

the continuity equation for r(q) reads

  (r2(q)s

0 (q)) =

r4  (r2(q)s0(q)) + (4  2d)r2r2

that, after setting r2(q) = h(q)r2(q), becomes

(4.71)

which is solved by

h(q) = r2d4.

we now show that (q = (q); q) vanishes identically. by (4.69) we have

5 relativistic extension and kleingordon equation

a basic property of the ep is that it has a universal character. in general, the implementation

of the ep leads to a deformation of the corresponding classical hj equation. in this respect, we

note that existence of a xed point in the nonrelativistic stationary case demands the principle

to be implemented in all the other circumstances. if we did not modify the timedependent

case as well, then taking the stationary limit would lead to inconsistencies. in other words,

since modifying the stationary classical equation comes from a modication of the classical
transformation properties of w, which in general gets an inhomogeneous contribution, such as
(q; qv), consistency implies that also in the timedependent case the potential cannot transform

as in the classical case.

we start by deriving the relativistic quantum hj equation (rqhje). here we will consider

the case in which the external potential is described by an arbitrary potential v (q, t). this

form will be particularly useful in deriving the timedependent quantum hj equation (qhje),

which in turn implies the timedependent schrodinger equation, as the nonrelativistic limit

of the rqhje. later on, we will consider the case in which the interaction is given in terms of

the electromagnetic fourvector a.

the relativistic classical hamiltonjacobi equation (rchje) reads

where

1
2m

d

(kscl(q, t))2 + wrel(q, t) = 0,

xk=1

wrel(q, t) =

1
2mc2 [ m2c4  (v (q, t) + tscl(q, t))2].

29

(5.1)

(5.2)

in the timeindependent case one has scl(q, t) = scl

0 (q)  et, and (5.1)(5.2) become

1
2m

d

(kscl

0 )2 + wrel = 0,

xk=1

and

wrel(q) =

1
2mc2 [ m2c4  (v (q)  e)2].

(5.3)

(5.4)

in the latter case, we can go through the same steps as in the nonrelativistic case and the

stationary rqhje reads

1
2m

(s0)2 + wrel 

h2
2m

r
r

= 0,

where r satises the continuity equation

  (r2s0) = 0.

furthermore, (5.5)(5.6) imply the stationary kleingordon equation

 h2c2 + (m2c4  v 2 + 2ev  e2) = 0,

where  = r exp(is0/h).

5.1 timedependent case

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

let us start by noticing that in the timedependent case, the (d + 1)dimensional rchje can

be cast in the form (later on summation on repeated indices is understood)

1
2m

sclscl + w 

rel = 0,

where  is the minkowski metric diag (1, 1, . . . , 1), and

rel(q) =

w 

1
2mc2 [ m2c4  v 2(q)  2cv (q)0scl(q)],

(5.8)

(5.9)

where q  (ct, q1, . . . , qd). we thus recognize that eq.(5.8) has the same structure as eq.(5.3),
the euclidean metric being replaced by the minkowskian one. also in this case, in order

to implement the ep, we have to modify the classical equation by adding a function to be

determined, namely

1
2m

(s)2 + wrel + q = 0.

observe that since now w 

rel depends on scl, we have to make the identication

wrel(q) =

1
2mc2 [ m2c4  v 2(q)  2cv (q)0s(q)],

(5.10)

(5.11)

30

which diers from w 
scl.

rel for the hamiltonian principal function as now s appears rather than

implementation of the ep requires that for an arbitrary w a state

w b

rel(qb) = (pb|pa)w a

rel(qa) + (qa; qb),

and

where this time

qb(qb) = (pb|pa)qa(qa)  (qa; qb),

(pb|p) =

furthermore, we obtain the cocycle condition

(qa; qc) = (pc|pb)h(qa; qb)  (qc; qb)i .

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15)

(5.16)

5.2 mobius symmetry and minkowski metric

in section 3 we showed that, as a consequence of eq.(2.31), (qa; qb) vanishes identically if qa
and qb are related by a mobius transformation. in the present case, we can prove the analogous
result that (qa; qb) vanishes if qa and qb are related by a conformal transformation, where the

conformal group, with respect to the minkowski metric, is generated by translations

dilatations

lorentz transformations

and the inversion

q  aq,

a  r,

q  q,

  o(d, 1),

q =

q
q2 ,

(5.17)

(5.18)

(5.19)

(5.20)

where q2 = qq. note that for the inversion to be welldened, rd+1 must be completed
by a cone at innity [22]. this space is the analogue of rd+1. the proof is the same as the one
provided in section 3. in particular, we have

(q + b; q) = f (q + b)  f (q).

(5.21)

31

(aq; q) = a2f (aq)  f (q),
(q; q) = f (q)  f (q),

(5.22)

(5.23)

where f is an arbitrary function satisfying f (0) = 0. as far as the inversion is concerned, the

proof needs to be slightly modied. the jacobian matrix of this mapping is given by

j 

 = q = 

q
q2 =

 

q2  2

qq
q4 ,

where q4  (q2)2. then

(jj t) = j 

j

which implies

note that q is involutive since

and therefore

q2 = qq =

1
q4 qq =

1
q2 ,

(q) =

q
q2 =

q
q2q2 = q.

since q2 is invariant under lorentz transformations, these commute with the inversion

(q) = q.

finally, under dilatations

(aq) =

(aq)

q2
a

=

aq

a2q2 = a1 q

q2 = a1q,

where q2

a = aqaq = a2q2. by (5.26) and (5.28)

(q; q) = (p|p)(q; q) = 

1
q4 ((q); q),

which implies that (q; q) vanishes when evaluated at any q0 solution of q = q

and that

(q; q)|q=q0 = 0,

(q; q)|q=q1 = (q; q)|q=q1,

(5.31)

(5.32)

(5.33)

where q1 satises q = q. by (5.16)

((aq); q) = (p|pa)((aq); aq) + (aq; q).

on the other hand, by (5.16) and (5.30)

((aq); q) = (a1q; q) = (p|p)(a1q; q) + (q; q),

therefore, by (5.22)

a2((aq); aq) + a2f (aq)  f (q) =

1
q4 [a2f (a1q)  f (q)] + (q; q).

picking a q0 such that q

0 = q0, eq.(5.36) yields

((aq0); aq0) = a4f (a1q0)  f (aq0).

(5.34)

(5.35)

(5.36)

(5.37)

now observe that any q, such that q2 > 0, can be expressed as aq0, where a2 = q2, and with
q0 a suitable solution of q = q. furthermore, by (5.30) we have a1q0 = (aq0), so that (5.37)
is equivalent to

(q; q) =

1
q4 f (q)  f (q),

q2 > 0.

on the other hand, picking a q1 such that q

1 = q1, eq.(5.36) yields

((aq1); aq1) = a4f (a1q

1)  f (aq1) + a2(f (q1)  f (q

1)) + a2(q; q)|q=q1.

taking a = 1, (5.39) becomes

(q1; q

1) = f (q1)  f (q1) + f (q1)  f (q1) + (q

1; q1),

which, by virtue of (5.33), is equivalent to

(q

1; q1) = f (q

1)  f (q1).

hence, (5.39) becomes

((aq1); aq1) = a4f (a1q

1)  f (aq1).

now observe that any q, such that q2 < 0, can be expressed as aq1, where a2 = q2, and with
q1 a suitable solution of q = q. furthermore, by (5.30) we have a1q
1 = (aq1), so that
(5.42) is equivalent to

(5.38)

(5.39)

(5.40)

(5.41)

(5.42)

(5.43)

(5.44)

(q; q) =

1
q4 f (q)  f (q),

q2 < 0.

thus, in general

(q; q) =

1
q4 f (q)  f (q).

33

however, also in the relativistic case we have the analogue of condition (2.19)

then, the same reasoning as in subsection 3.5 leads to

frel(s, s, . . .) = 0.

therefore, we can state the following result

f = 0.

(5.45)

(5.46)

eq.(5.45) and the cocycle condition (5.16) imply that (qa; qb) vanishes when qa and qb are related

by a conformal transformation

((q); q) = 0,

(5.47)

5.3 the rqhje

let us now consider the following identity

2(s)2 =

(res )
res 

r
r 


r2   (r2s),

(5.48)

which holds for any constant  and any functions r,s. then, if r satises the continuity

(5.50)

(5.51)

(5.52)

(5.53)
first of all, we have seen that the system described by s(q) = s(q), where q = q + b, has the
important property that wrel(q) = wrel(q). furthermore, we nd

qrel = 

h2
2m

r
r  g.

  ( r2  s) =   ( r2s) = 0.

34

(5.54)

comparing this with the continuity equation   (r2s) = 0, we have that under poincare
transformations, the rfunction of the transformed system dened by s(q) = s(q) has the
transformation property

therefore, by (5.47) and (5.55) we have

r(q) = r(q).

g =

2m

 r
r  q =

r
r  q = g,

(5.55)

(5.56)

that is g is a scalar under the poincare transformations. this implies that g(q) may depend only
on s0, (s0)2, r, r and (r)2 and higher derivatives which are invariant under poincare
transformations. however, in the timeindependent limit the rqhje must reduce to (5.5), in
particular qrel  q. therefore, g must vanish in this limit implying

then, the rqhje reads

g = 0.

where r and s satisfy the continuity equation

5.4 nonrelativistic limit

(5.57)

(5.58)

(5.59)

in this section we will consider the nonrelativistic limit of the rqhje. this will yield the time

dependent nonrelativistic qhje together with the timedependent schrodinger equation.

to perform the classical limit we rst need to make the usual substitution s = s  mc2t

and then taking the limit c  . we have

(5.63)

with the timedependent nonrelativistic continuity equation being

it is then easy to see that (5.63) and (5.64) imply

(5.64)

(5.65)

where  = r exp(is/h). note that if we used  = r exp(is/h), then we would get the
complex conjugate of (5.65).

6 gauge invariance and ep

in section 5, we derived the rqhje with an arbitrary potential. as a byproduct, we obtained

the timedependent schrodinger equation in the nonrelativistic limit. this was a nice step

as it indicates that, to be correctly implemented, the ep must be formulated in the exact

framework, that is the relativistic one. in other words, even if the timedependent schrodinger

equation can be derived directly in the nonrelativistic framework [6], the natural realm to

implement the ep is not in the approximate theory. in fact, while the kleingordon equation

follows naturally from the ep, the derivation of the timedependent schrodinger equation is

less straightforward if one derives it directly in the nonrelativistic theory.

however, even if the derivation of the rqhje is perfectly consistent, the formulation be-

comes particularly transparent if one works with gauge theories.

6.1 minimal coupling from the ep

the point is that in general we considered w as an external xed quantity, then the corrections
concerned scl, as s solves an equation which is modied by the quantum potential. never-
theless, we saw that if one considers the relativistic extension, then w contains s itself. so
special relativity leads to consider w as composed by an external potential and s (see (5.9)).
on the other hand, standard qm problems generally correspond to eective potentials. so,

for example, the potential well, does not exist in nature as a fundamental interaction. due to

the nature of the ep, one should expect that it can be naturally formulated in the framework

of fundamental interactions. on the other hand, since we are in the relativistic framework,

interactions cannot be strictly separated in kinetic and potential part. so the only possibility
is that both are included in a generalized kinetic term, with w being spacetime independent.

36

it is clear that this xes the interaction to be described in terms of the minimal coupling. on

the other hand, the minimal coupling prescription is at the heart of gauge theories.

we now show how the ep is naturally implemented once one considers the minimal coupling

prescription. let us consider the interaction to be described in terms of the electromagnetic
fourvector a. let us set p cl
 + ea where pcl
 = scl
is the generalized one. in this case the rchje reads

 is particles momentum and p cl

 = pcl

where a0 =  v

ec. note that now

2m

(scl  ea)2 +

1
2

mc2 = 0,

w =

1
2

mc2,

(6.1)

(6.2)

and the critical case corresponds to the limit situation in which m = 0. as usual, in order to

implement the ep, we are forced to add a correction to (6.1)

1
2m

(s  ea)2 +

1
2

mc2 + q = 0.

we then proceed to implement the ep. as usual this amounts to require that

and

where

(pb|p) =
and j is the jacobian matrix

w b(qb) = (pb|pa)w a(qa) + (qa; qb),

qb(qb) = (pb|pa)qa(qa)  (qa; qb),

(pb  eab)2
(p  ea)2 =

j 

 =

,

(p  ea)tjj t(p  ea)
(p  ea)t(p  ea)
q
qb .

furthermore, we obtain the cocycle condition

(qa; qc) = (pc|pb)h(qa; qb)  (qc; qb)i .

(6.3)

(6.4)

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

as we proved in subsection 5.1, (qa; qb) vanishes if qa and qb are related by a conformal trans-

formation.

as usual we now have to consider the relevant identity for the (generalized) kinetic term.

we have

where

2(s  ea)2 =

r2   (r2(s  ea)).

d =   ea,

37

(6.9)

(6.10)

and

d2  dd =   2ea + 2e2a2  e(a).

(6.11)

since the identity (6.9) holds for any r, s and , we can require   (r2(s  ea)) = 0, and
then set  = i/h to have

(s  ea)2 = h2


r

(6.12)

we stress that there is no loss of generality in considering (6.12) since, by  (r2(s ea)) = 0,
this is an identity.

we now show that

h2

w =

d2(re

+ g.

(6.13)

(6.14)

(6.15)

similarly to the case of the function g in eq.(5.56), also here g is a scalar function under poincare
transformations. furthermore, since in the a  0 limit we should reproduce eq.(5.58) with
wrel = mc2/2, we see that

g = 0,

(6.16)

and the rqhje reads

(s  ea)2 + m2c2  h2

r
r

= 0,

where r and s satisfy the continuity equation

  (r2(s  ea)) = 0.

(6.17)

(6.18)

let us stress that the same result can be directly obtained from (5.1)(5.2) by observing that
(5.8) coincides with (6.1) after setting wrel = mc2/2 and replacing scl by scl  ea.

one can check that eqs.(6.17)(6.18) imply the kleingordon equation

where

(ih + ea)2 + m2c2 = 0,

 = re

i

h s.

38

(6.19)

(6.20)

if we considered  = re i

h s, then we would have the complex conjugate of (6.19)

(ih  ea)2 + m2c2 = 0.

(6.21)

in the timeindependent limit a = ( v

ec, 0, . . . , 0), tv = 0, both (6.19) and (6.21) reduce
to the stationary kleingordon equation (5.7). correspondingly, eq.(6.18) reduces to the

stationary continuity equation (5.6)

  (r2(s  ea)) =   (r2s0) 

1
c2 (tr2(v  e) + r2tv ) =   (r2s0) = 0.

(6.22)

6.2 ep and mass generation

a special property of the ep is that it cannot be implemented in cm because of the xed
point corresponding to w 0  0. implementing the ep then forces us to introduce a univocally
determined piece to the classical hj equation. a remarkable fact is that in the case of the
rchje (6.1), the xed point w 0(q0)  0 corresponds to m = 0. the ep then implies that
from this all the other masses can be generated by a coordinate transformation. thus, we have

masses correspond to the inhomogeneous term in the transformation properties of the w 0 state
(6.23)

mc2 = (q0; q).

1
2

furthermore, by (6.4) (6.5) masses are expressed in terms of the quantum potential

1
2

mc2 = (p|p0)q0(q0)  q(q).

(6.24)

a basic feature of the formulation is that the ep implies that s is never trivial. so, for
example also in the case of the nonrelativistic particle with v  e = 0, we have a nontrivial
in particular, in [6] the role of the quantum potential was seen
quantum potential [1][6].

as a sort of intrinsic selfenergy which is reminiscent of the relativistic selfenergy. eq.(6.24)

provides a more explicit evidence of such an interpretation.

furthermore, in [5, 6] it has been shown that tunnelling is a direct consequence of the

quantum potential. in particular, q provides the energy to make p real, and can be seen as

the response of the particle selfenergy to external potentials. this example also shows that

external potential and particle energy are strictly related, and so they should be considered as

components of a single object. in part, this is what the minimal coupling prescription provides.

however, the ep, which naturally leads to such a prescription, also implies the additional

quantum potential. in [1][6] it has been shown that this contribution is not xed, rather it

39

may change once the hidden variables are changed. in particular, a change of  corresponds
to a mixing between the p2/2m term and the quantum potential. we now show that in higher

dimension there is a new degree of freedom, represented by an antisymmetric tensor, which is

related to the hidden variables.

6.3 ep and the hidden antisymmetric tensor of qm

a basic property of the formulation immediately appears in one dimension once we consider the

qshje. to understand this point it is useful to recall that the dierence between the qshje

and the one considered by bohm, is that the qshje is written in terms of one function only:
the reduced action s0. while we always have s0 6= cnst, in bohm theory one has s0 = cnst for
bound states. however, if one excludes, as implied by the ep, the trivial solution, then one can

obtain the qshje from the standard version. in doing this one has to express r in terms of
s0 by solving the continuity equation. we now show that if one tries to write down the qhje
in higher dimension by solving the continuity equation, then a new eld appears. we already

encountered this situation in subsection 4.2. namely, we saw that the continuity equation of
the qshje implies that r2s0 is given by the generalized curl of a (d  2)form f . more
precisely, we saw that

this equation is equivalent to

r2is0 =  i2...id

i

i2fi3...id .

r2is0 = jbij,

where bij is the antisymmetric twotensor

in other words, the 2form b is the hodge dual of f

bij =  i3...id

ij

fi3...id .

and the continuity equation is

b = f,

d+d+  f = ddf = 0.

in the timedependent relativistic case f is a (d  1)form. we have
1f2...d = b,

r2(s  ea) =  1...d



that is

r2 =

(s  ea)
(s  ea)2 b,

40

(6.25)

(6.26)

(6.27)

(6.28)

(6.29)

(6.30)

(6.31)

or, equivalently,

r4 =

bb

(s  ea)2 .

in terms of b and r the rqhje (6.17) reads

 bb + r4m2c2  h2r3r = 0.

(6.32)

(6.33)

the ep itself and the appearence of a new eld indicates that now the rqhje should be

considered in a dierent context with respect to the usual one. so, for example, one may wonder

if the beld may help in considering a possible quantum origin of fundamental interactions. in

the introduction we suggested that qm and gr are facets of the same medal. more generally

one should understand if there is a possible role of qm underlying the fundamental interactions

or, more precisely, whether the ep underlies the structure of fundamental interactions trhough

qm. we already saw evidence of the dynamical role of qm through the quantum potential [6],

e.g. in considering the tunnel eect. in this context one should understand whether eq.(6.33)

may provide a dierent understanding of the usual problems one meets in considering the

kleingordon equation.

let us nd how r transforms under general vmaps, q  q(q) = v(q). in the q system we

have

f2...d =

q2
 q2

. . .

qd
 qd

f2...d,

(6.34)

therefore

0...d ( 0

f2...d = 0...d

1f2...d =

det  q

 q! 0...d (0s  ea0)1f2...d,

(6.35)

where we used the fact that the second derivatives of the jacobian matrix get cancelled due to

the antisymmetry of the levicivita tensor. finally, by (6.30) and (6.31), we have

r2 = det  q

 q! (p|p)r2,

(6.36)

that holds also in the stationary nonrelativistic case with (p|p) given by (2.15). given (6.36),
we easily rederive the transformation property of r under the inversion q(q) we derived in
subsection 4.3. in fact by (3.48) and (3.49) we have det2(j 1) = det(r41d), that is

det2  q

q! = det(r41d) = r4d,

(6.37)

41

then, as by (3.50) (p|p) = r4, we obtain

r2(q) = r2d4r2(q).

(6.38)

it is then convenient to use (6.36) to nd the transformation property of r under the inversion

(5.20). by (5.25) and (5.26), we have

r2(q) = (q2)d1r2(q).
