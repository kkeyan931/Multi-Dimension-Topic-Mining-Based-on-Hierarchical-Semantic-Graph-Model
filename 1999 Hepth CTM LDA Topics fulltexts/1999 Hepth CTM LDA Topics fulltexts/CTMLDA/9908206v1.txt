abstract

it is shown that the model of 2d dilaton gravity is equivalent to the dynamical

system of massless particles in the liouville eld.

introduction

the einstein theory of gravity in 2-dimensions is degenerated [1]. the corresponding

action

s0 = z d2x g r

(1.1)

is expressed only through the surface terms and its variation identically vanishes. as a
result, the einstein equations rab  1/2 rgab = 0 in 2-dimensions are identities rather
than dynamical equations.

the covariant equations rab1/2 gab = 0, where  is a constant, can be considered as
a model of 2d general relativity. these equations are equivalent to r = , but construction

of the corresponding covariant action only in terms of the metric tensor gab is problematic.

locally, any 2d lorentzian manifold is conformally at [2], i.e. in some local coordi-

nates the metric tensor can be written in the form

(1.2)

where x := (x0, x1) and q(x) is a eld. the constant curvature manifold in the conformal

gauge (1.2) is described by the liouville equation [3]

(2
0  2

1) q(x) + eq(x) = 0,

which is a variational equation for the functional

s[q] = 1/2z d2x h(0q)2  (1q)2  2eqi .

(1.3)

(1.4)

action (1.4) has non-covariant form from the point of view of general relativity and to

obtain the corresponding covariant action it is necessary to introduce some additional

auxiliary elds. a covariant model with minimal extension is 2d dilaton gravity [4],

which arises in polyakov string theory [5].

for a system with reparametrization invariant action and auxiliary elds, usually, it

is dicult to guess what are the physical variables and what kind of physical degrees of

freedom they dene. such analysis can be done using the diracs procedure for constrained

systems based on the hamiltonian reduction [6]. in the case of 2d dilaton gravity, this

procedure eliminates all eld degrees of freedom and after full hamiltonian reduction the

system only with nite degrees of freedom remains [7].

in this paper we compare the model of 2d dilaton gravity with the system of massless

particle in the corresponding liouville eld [8] and demonstrate their equivalence.

the paper is organized as follows:

in section 2 we prove degeneracy of 2d einstein

gravity. obtained formulas are used in section 3 for the description of 2d dilaton grav-

ity. in section 4 we consider the examples of constant curvature manifolds with global

symmetries and analyze the corresponding models of 2d dilaton gravity. in conclusions

we show equivalence of the considered models of 2d gravity and the dynamical systems

of massless particles.

ii degeneracy of general relativity in 2-dimensions
the einstein-hilbert lagrangian l0 := g r can be splitted in two parts [1]

l0 = l1 + l2,

(2.1)

where the rst term l1 contains derivatives of the metric tensor gab only in the rst order

with

l1 =

1
2

b

abc(g gac) 

1
2

c

abc(g gab),

c

ab :=

1
2

gcd(agbd + bgad  dgab)

and the second term l2 is a total derivative
l2 = chg (gabc

ab  gacb

ab)i .

2

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

as a result, l2 has no contribution in the variational equations rab  1/2 rgab = 0 and
the einstein tensor gab := rab  1/2 rgab is dened only through l1

gab =

1

g   l1

gab  c

 cgab! .
l1

(2.5)

eqs. (2.1)-(2.5) are valid for arbitrary dimension (d  2) of spacetime, but the case
d = 2 posses certain singularity. the reimann tensor of 2d manifold has only one inde-

pendent component r0101 and the corresponding einstein tensor gab identically vanishes

for arbitrary metric tensor gab. therefore, 2d einstein equations are identities and not

the dynamical equations for gab. this degeneracy can be seen from the einstein-hilbert

action (1.1) as well.

writing the metric tensor of 2d spacetime in the form

gab = 


a b

b c




and using (2.2)-(2.4) we get

l1 = 

1
2g3 [a( bc   cb) + b( ca  ac ) + c( ab  ba)],

where

l2 = t  c  b

g ! + x  a  b
g ! ,

g := g = b2  ac

and we also use the notations x0 := t, x1 := x; ta := a, xa := a, ....

note that (2.7) can be considered as a value of the 2-form

 = 

1
2g3 (a db  dc + b dc  da + c da  db),

on the tangent vectors vt := ( a, b, c) and vx := (a, b, c ):

since 2-form (2.10) is exact  = d [9], (2.11) can be written as

l1 = (vt, vx)

l1 = t(vx)  x(vt).

thus, in 2-dimensions, l1 is also a total derivative.

iii the model of 2d gravity with dilaton eld

let us consider a model of 2d gravity dened by the action [4]

s = z d2x g (cid:20) 1

2

gabab  r + (cid:21) ,

(2.13)

(2.14)

(3.1)

where  is a scalar (dilaton) led and  is a cosmological constant.

variation of (3.1) with respect to the dilaton eld denes the dynamical equation



1

g

s


= 2 + r = 0.

(3.2)

to calculate variations of (3.1) with respect to the gravitational eld gab we use

ous section. using (2.1)-(2.4) and neglecting the boundary terms, the functional sd :=

the analysis of the einstein-hilbert lagrangian l0 := g r(gab) given in the previ-
r d2x g r can be written as

sd  z d2x(l1  ax a), with x a = g (gbca

bc  gabc

bc).

(3.3)

(3.4)

the variation of (3.3) reads

1

g

sd
gab = gab + (gab2  ab),

where ab = 2

ab + c

abc.

eq. (3.4) valid for arbitrary dimension of spacetime. since in 2-dimensions the einstein

tensor gab vanishes, for the variational equations of (3.1) we obtain

2

g

s

gab = ab + gab(cid:18)

1
2

gcdcd  (cid:19)  2(gab2  ab) = 0.

(3.5)

note that eq.(3.4) in 2-dimensions can be veried from (2.14) as well.

taking trace of (3.5) and using (3.2) we get that the dynamical system (3.1) describes

a spacetime manifold with a constant curvature r = .

4

the conformal gauge (1.2) leads to the following form of the dynamical equations (3.2)

and (3.5)

2
+, = 0,

42

+,q = eq.

(+)2  22

+,+ = (+q)2  22

+,+q,

()2  22

, = (q)2  22

,q,

(3.6)

(3.7)

where x := x1  x0 are the light cone coordinates and  := q  .

as it was expected, the eld q(x) satises the liouville equation (1.3), while (x) is

a free eld. according to (3.7), the traceless energy-momentum tensors [10-11] of these

two elds are equal to each other.

the general solution of the liouville equation has the form [3]

q(x+, x) = log

8a+ (x+)a (x)

|| [a+(x+) + a(x)]2

(3.8)

where  is a sign of  ( = /||) and a are any monotonic functions with a  > 0.

the conformal form of the metric tensor (1.2) xes the gauge freedom only up to the

conformal transformations

x 7 x;

x = f (x)

(3.9)

the corresponding transformation of the eld q is given by

q(x+, x) 7 q(x+, x) = q(f +(x+), f (x)) + log f + (x+)f  (x).

(3.10)

the general solution (3.8) can be obtained by the conformal transformation (with

f (x) = a(x)) of the liouville eld

q(x+, x) = log

8

||(x+ + x)2 .

(3.11)

hence, all liouville elds (with xed ) are related to each other by the conformal trans-

formations (3.9)-(3.10). since the considered system is reparametrization invariant, one

can x the eld q(x) by suitable choice of local coordinates.

after xing the liouville eld q(x) the dynamical freedom of the system is described

by the free eld (x), which should be dened from (3.7). these equations are ordinary

dierential equations for two chiral parts (x) of the free eld (x) = +(x+)+(x).

for a xed right hand side of (3.7) the corresponding freedom is described by a nite

number of integration constants.

5

thus, the system (3.1) has no physical degrees of freedom for eld variables and full

gage xing leads to a nite dimensional system. this result can be obtained by the

hamiltonian reduction procedure as well (see [7]).

it should be noted that the conjecture about the conformal form of the metric tensor

(1.2) is valid only locally. therefore, constructions of this section have only a local

character. to get the global picture of the system one should specify the global properties

of spacetime.

iv the examples of 2d dilaton gravity

the one-sheet hyberboloid

 (y0)2 + (y1)2 + (y2)2 = m2,

(4.1)

embedded in 3-dimensional minkowski space is the example of lorentzian manifold with
constant curvature [2]. the parameter m (m > 0) denes the scalar curvature r = 2m2.
it is obvious that the isometry group of the hyperboloid is so(2.1).

using the parametrization

y0 = 
where

,

y1 =

cot m

m
 ]0, /m[,

y2 =

sin m

m sin m

,

,

cos m
m sin m
  [0, 2/m[

we get the conformal form (1.2) of the induced metric tensor

gab(, ) =

which denes the liouville eld (1.3)

1

sin2 m 


1
0
0 1

,




q(, ) =  log sin2 m,

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

for  = 2m2. the parameters  and  can be identied with the spacetime coordinates
x0 and x1, respectively. the corresponding light-cone coordinates we denote by  ( :=
  ).

the traceless energy momentum tensor for (4.4) is given by

t++ := (+q)2  22

+,+q = m2,

t := (q)2  22

,q = m2.

(4.5)

6

and (3.7) denes the following two equations for the chiral +(x+) and anti-chiral (x)

parts of the free eld 

(

+)2  2(

+) = m2,

(

)2  2(

) = m2.

after integration we get

 = + +  = c  log sin2 m

2

(+  +)  log sin2 m

2

(  ),

(4.6)

(4.7)

where  and c (0   < 2/m) are integration constants. actually, these three
parameters describe all freedom of the system.

the general solution (4.7) has two lines of singularity at  =   . according to

(4.2), the coordinates of singularity lines on the hyperboloid (4.1) satisfy the relations

y0 + y1 cos m + y2 sin m = 0,

y1 sin m  y2 cos m = 

1
m

,

(4.8)

which dene generatrices of the hyperboloid.

the cauchy data for the eld (, ) at the moment  = 0 is given by two functions

0() := (0, )

and 0() := (0, ).

(4.9)

these functions are singular at the points  =   0. when these points are dierent
(+  0 6=  + 0), behaviour of the functions (4.9) near the singular points is given by
(see (4.7))

0()  log

4

m2(    0)2 ,

0()  

2

    0

.

(4.10)

if 0 is a moment of intersection of singularity lines, the singularity points coincide
(+  0 =  + 0 := 0 ). in that case 0() is regular and

0()  log

8

m2(  0)2 .

thus, the character of singularities of the cauchy data is preserved in dynamics if the

singularity lines does not intersect each other. this case correspond to + = .

another example of spacetime manifold with constant negative curvature can be re-

lated to the liouville eld (3.11) for  < 0. this eld is singular at x0 = 0.

if one

excludes the singularity line (see fig.1), the domains x0 > 0 and x0 < 0 can be considered

7

as two dierent patches of the hyperboloid (4.1). the corresponding conformal map to

the coordinates (, ) (see (4.2)) can be written as

x =

1
m

tan

m
2

(  ).

(4.11)

the traceless energy momentum tensor for the liouville eld (3.11) identically vanishes

and (3.7) denes the following free eld

 = 2 log m 2|(x+  +)(x  )|

(4.12)

where  and m are the integration constants. the free elds (4.7) and (4.12) are related

by the conformal map (4.11) and the case with non intersecting singularities (+ = )

correspond to + =  (see fig.1).

let us consider the stripe (see fig.2)

s := {(t, x) | t  r, x ]0, /m[},

(4.13)

with the metric tensor

g(t, x) =

.

(4.14)

1

sin2 mx 


1
0
0 1




the coordinates x and t are associated with space (x1) and time (x0) coordinates, respec-

tively. from (4.14) we get the positive constant curvature r = 2m2. the isometry group

of the manifold (4.13)-(4.14) is the universal covering group of sl(2.r).

the liouville eld q =  log sin2 mx denes the traceless energy-momentum tensor
given by (4.5) and for the free eld  we again get (4.7) (substituting  by x := x  t).
the dierence is only in the domain of admissible values of the coordinates x. since the

time coordinate t is not restricted, the singularity lines are given by

x  t   =

2
m

n,

(4.15)

where n are any integers.

in general, the corresponding left and right moving lines

intersect each other. one can avoid intersection of singularities, assuming again + = .

in that case the free eld (t, x) is singular only on the zigzag line (see fig.2) and the

class of singularities for the cauchy data is preserved.

8

v conclusion

analysis of 2d dilaton gravity shows its similarity to the system of massless particle in

the corresponding gravitational eld. as it is shown in [8], the trajectories of massless

particle on the hyperboloid (4.1) are given by the generatrices (4.8), and the zigzag line

of fig.2 is the trajectory on the stripe (4.13).

since the dilaton (scalar) eld  = q has the same singularities as the free eld , we
can associate the dilaton eld with the massless scalar particles. in the case of hyperboloid

the dilaton eld describes two massless particles moving in opposite directions (fig.1),

while for the stripe there is only one particle oscillating between the edges of universe

(fig.2). by this correspondence we have the kinematical equivalence between the eld

theory model and the particle system. the dynamical equivalence can be achieved using
the modied energy-momentum tensor. adding the term (gab2  ab) exp (1/2 ) to
the traceless tensor (4.5) (see [12]), we get the localized energy-momentum density, which

is concentrated at the singularities of the congurations (4.7).
