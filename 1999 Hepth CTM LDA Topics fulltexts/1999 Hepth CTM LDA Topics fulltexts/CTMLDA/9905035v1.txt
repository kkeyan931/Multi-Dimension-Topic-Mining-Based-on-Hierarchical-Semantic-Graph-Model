abstract

non-equilibrium quantum eld theory studies time dependence of processes which are
not available for the s-matrix description. one of the new methods of investigation in non-
equilibrium quantum theory is the stochastic limit method. this method is an extension of
the works by bogoliubov, van hove and prigogine and it permits to study not only the system
but also the reservoir degrees of freedom. we consider the stochastic limit of translation
invariant hamiltonians in quantum eld theory and show that the master eld satises a
new type of commutation relations, the so called entangled (or interacting) commutation
relations. these relations extend the interacting fock relations established earlier in non-
relativistic qed and the free (or boltzmann) commutation relations which have been found
in the large n limit of qcd . as an application of the stochastic limit method we consider the
photon splitting cascades in magnetic eld and show that photons in cascades form entangled
states (triphons) and they obey not bose but a new type of statistics corresponding to the
entangled commutation relations.

1 introduction

the basic object to study in quantum eld theory is the s-matrix introduced by heisenberg.
bogoliubov and shirkov have developed the s-matrix formalism which includes all the quantities
considered in quantum eld theory [1]. the physical idea behind the s-matrix approach is that in
the scattering processes there exists a characteristic time scale such that in a time regime larger
then this time scale one can neglect interaction and particles evolve according to the free dynamics.
the situation in statistical physics is dierent because here one has not just one but several
relevant time scales and as a result we dont have here a universal method comparable with the
s-matrix approach in quantum eld theory. one can say that the role of s-matix approach in
non-equilibrium statistical physics is played by various master and kinetic equations. it was the
fundamental bogoliubov idea about the existence of two time scales which lead to the modern
progress in the microscopic derivation of kinetic equations [2].

methods of quantum eld theory, in particularly green functions, are widely used in equilib-
rium and non-equilibrium statistical physics [3, 4, 5]. it is well known that the so-called double-
time thermodynamic green functions which were used by bogoliubov and tyablikov [6] have had
great success especially when applied to magnetic problems. from the other side there are not
so many investigations in quantum eld theory where results and methods of non-equilibrium
statistical physics are exploited. n.n. bogoliubov has made great contributions to both of these
sciences. as far as we know his works in non-equilibrium statistical physics and in quantum eld
theory were performed completely separately. probably the reason was that important problems
in quantum eld theory in that time were related with the scattering processes described by the
s-matrix and they were really very dierent from typical problems in non-equilibrium statistical
physics such as the derivation of kinetic equations.

we would like to point out that there are important problems in quantum eld theory where
the standard s-matrix description is not very convenient or even not applicable. these include not
only investigation of bound states and spectral problems (see [1]) but also processes with unstable
particles [7, 8] (in fact almost all particles are unstable), atom-photon interactions [9], elementary
particles in semidressed states with non-equilibrium proper elds [10], electroweak baryogenesis
and phase transitions in the early universe and in high-energy collisions [11], quantum optics
[12] etc. in the consideration of such processes we are interested in the time regime smaller than
the innite time when the s-matrix description becomes applicable. one can say that the
consideration of such processes belongs to non-equilibrium quantum eld theory. one believes
that the method of s-matrix in quantum eld theory is analogous to the gibbs distribution
in equilibrium statistical physics and that there exists a general method (the stochastic limit,
see below) in non-equilibrium quantum eld theory which provides a description of quantum
phenomena depending on time. one of the rst works on the systematic application of methods
of non-equilibrium statistical physics in quantum eld theory is the work of prigogine [13] in which
kinetic equations for the lee model have been derived.

a general method in non-equilibrium quantum eld theory is the method of stochastic limit
[14, 15]. the idea of this method is the systematic application of the 2t-limit and quantum
stochastic dierential equations. one considers the evolution operator u(t) of quantum system
for small coupling constant  and large time t. intuitively, the weak coupling  long time limit
means that we are looking at times in which the particle has already weakly interacted many times
with the eld (long time cumulative eects). the net average eect of these interactions amounts

2

to a loss of memory (markovian approximation). therefore in this limit we can expect to be able
to approximate the microscopic time evolution, which contains complicated memory eects, with
a simpler markovian evolution.

when we say that the s-matrix method is not sucient in non-equilibrium quantum eld
theory we mean that the standard dynamical denition of the s-matrix in real time is given
for example in terms of wave operators (including dressing [16, 17, 18]) or lsz-formalism. this
denition can not be applied immediately to the processes with unstable particles. the exible
bogoliubov shirkov approach [1] to s-matrix in principle can be applied to the description of
unstable particles. there exists a phenomenological approach to s-matrix which is not based on
a hamiltonian formalism. in this approach unstable particles are described by the breit-wigner
complex poles of the scattering amplitudes [19]. the dynamical justication of this phenomenolog-
ical approach is given in the weisskopf-wigner resolvent method, for a discussion of the resolvent
method see for example [8, 20]. the resolvent method is usually used for the investigation of
the degrees of freedom of the system interacting with reservoir. the stochastic limit method is
conveniently used for the consideration of degrees of freedom not only of the system but also of
the reservoir.

the rst rigorous result about the interaction of a system with a reservoir where the role of
a scaling limit involving 2t begun to emerge, is due to bogoliubov [21] (see the next section).
friedrichs, in the context of the now well known friedrichs model [22], was lead to consider the
scaling limit

  0,
by second order perturbation theory.

t  ,

2t = constant

(1)

in the mid 1950s van hove [16] used this scaling as a device to extract the eects of a small
perturbation of the global hamiltonian of a composite system, on the reduced evolution of a
subsystem and to derive a paulitype master equation describing the irreversible time evolution
of the observables of the subsystem. therefore, in the quantum theory of open systems, the limit
(1) is known as the van hove or the 2t limit.

using the perturbative development of the dynamics in powers of , van hove argued that the
terms of order 2n should behave as 2ntn (in contrast with the rough estimate 2nt2n). furthermore
he made plausible that almost all the terms of order 2n should behave as 2ntn, for some  > 0
and therefore vanish in the limit (1), while the remaining terms should sum so to give a transport
equation.

1/2, ..., xn, x0

in the stochastic limit we study the behaviour of the system in the large time and small coupling
constant regime. if g(x1, ...xn) is the green function then we want to investigate the asymptotic
behaviour of the expression g(x1, x0
n/2) when   0. this can be performed by
using the anisotropic renormalization group method [1, 23, 24].
notice that the 2ntnbehaviour of the terms of order 2n of the iterated series is exactly of the
same order of magnitude of the behaviour of the moments of order 2n of a brownian motion with
time parameter rescaled as 2t. therefore a posteriori we can interpret van hoves perturbative
result as a st indication that the limit (1) should evidentiate a kind of quantum brownian motion
or quantum white noise underlying the dynamics of the quantum system. to describe and to solve
the dynamical equations after the stochastic limit one has to derive the stochastic limit for the
collective operators, the so called master eld. for simple models the master eld is the quantum
white noise whose creation and annihilation operators satisfy the relations

[b(t), b+(t)] = (t  t)

3

(2)

in the stochastic limit one gets for the evolution operator the equation

du(t)

dt

= (f +(t)b(t) + b+(t)f (t))u(t)

here the white noise operators b(t), b+(t) are singular operator functions of t and f (t) is a reg-
ular operator function of t. this singular equation represents the hamiltonian form of quantum
stochastic dierential equations. this equation can be explicitly solved for many models. the
crucial role for the possibility of the explicit solution plays the commutation relation (1).

for more complex models the master elds are more complex and one gets the entangled
or interacting commutation relations. the program of investigation of models of quantum eld
theory in the stochastic limit consists from two parts. first we have to nd the commutation
relations for the master eld and then study the singular dierential equation for the evolution
operator. in this paper we shall discuss only the rst part of the program. for the consideration
of the evolution operator see for example [15, 25, 26].

in recent years various modications and deformations of the algebra of canonical commutation
relations have been discussed, see for example [27, 28, 29] and references therein. in particular,
in the large n limit for su(n) invariant gauge theory (as well as for nxn matrix models), the
following relations

b(k)b+(k) = (k  k)

(3)

appear naturally [29]. here k, k are momentum variables. the algebra generated by the operators
b(k), b+(k) satisfying (3) is called the free (or boltzmann) algebra.

in this paper we prove that the stochastic limit of interacting elds, under the only constraint
of momentum conservation, leads to a new algebra of commutation relations. we get the relations
of the form

b(p|k1, ..., km)b+(p|k

1, ..., k

m) = n(p)(e(p, k1, ..., km))(p  p)(k1  k

1)...(kn  k
n)

(4)

where b(p|k1, ..., km) is the master eld, obtained as the stochastic limit of a translation invariant
interaction hamiltonian, n(p) is the operator density of particles, and e(p, k1, ..., km) is the energy
associated with the interaction vertex. these relations are called the entangled (or interacting)
commutation relations. notice that the equality (4) extends the boltzmann algebra (3) because
the right hand side is an operator (in the particle space) rather than a scalar: in this sense one
speaks of hilbert module [30] (rather than hilbert space) commutation relations. b(p|k1, ..., km)
and the density n(p) satisfy

[n(p), b(p|k1, ..., km)] = ((p  p)  (p  p +x ki))b(p|k1, ..., km)

(5)

as one of physical applications of the above ideas we will argue that photon splitting cascades
in the magnetic eld create entangled states and that photons in cascades obey not bose but a
new type of statistics  innite or quantum boltzmann statistics. therefore, this statistics has a
physical meaning since it describes photons in cascades and more generally the dominant diagrams
in the long time/weak coupling limit in quantum eld theory. the states in cascades are formed
from triples of entangled photons and may be called triphons. they belong to an interacting fock
space [30, 31]. interacting cuntz algebra has been considered in [32].

the standard denition of the stochastic limit is given as the limit of the wightman correlation
function. for some models the limit of these correlation functions is equal to zero. we show that
the stochastic limit for the green functions is non-trivial even in these cases.

the paper is organized as follows. in sect. 2 we remind the bogoliubov theorem and compare
it with the stochastic limit. in sect. 3 we discuss the stochastic limit. sections 4 and 5 are devoted
to the derivation of the entangled commutation relations. in sect. 6 we discuss the stochastic
limit for the green functions and in sect. 7 the universality classes of the stochastic limit and
decay processes are considered. finally sect. 8 is devoted to applications of the stochastic limit
to photon splitting cascades.

2 bogoliubovs theorem

the rst rigorous result, about the interaction of a system with a reservoir, where the role of a
scaling limit involving 2t begun to emerge, is due to bogoliubov [21] who considered a classical
system with hamiltonian

h = hs + hr + hint

 j()d <  as n   with j() being a non-negative
he assumed that p<n2
continuous function. supposing that, at t = 0 the system is in the state q = q0, p = p0 and that
the state of the reservoir is a random variable with the distribution r = exp{hr/t} he proved
that:

n/2

n  r 

 as n   the limit distribution s = s(t, p, q) of the random variables p = pt, q = qt, of

the system, exists at any time t > 0.

 if hs is given by (2), dene the function 0

s = 0(t, hs) = 0(t, p, q), by:

3 the stochastic limit

the stochastic limit is now widely used in the consideration of the long time/weak coupling
behaviour of quantum dynamical systems with dissipation, see for example [15].

let be given a quantum system described by the hamiltonian

where  is the coupling constant. the starting point of the stochastic limit is the equation for the
evolution operator in interaction picture

h = h0 + v

where

du ()(t)

dt

= iv (t)u ()(t)

v (t) = eith0v eith0

the main idea is that there exist a new quantum eld (master eld) and a new evolution operator
u(t) (they both live on a space dierent from the original one) which approximates the old one

u ()(t)  u(2t)

and the approximation is meant in the sense of appropriately chosen matrix elements. the above
approximation suggests a natural interpretation of the van hove rescaling [16]   0, t  
it means that we measure time in units of 1/2
so that 2t  constant =  (new time scale):
where  measures the strength of the selfinteraction. by putting  = 1 we see that the van hove
rescaling is equivalent to the time rescaling t  t/2, and therefore the limit   0 will capture
the dominating contributions to the dynamics in the new time scale (the error can be estimated to
be of order 2). it is remarkable that in this limit the dominating contributions can be explicitly
resummed giving rise to a new unitary operator.

a simple change of variables shows that the time rescaling t  t/2 is equivalent to the

following rescaling of the schrodinger equation for the evolution operator:

du ()(t/2)

dt

= i

1


v (t/2)u ()(t/2)

the unitary operator u(t) is then obtained by taking the limit   0:

u(t) = lim

0

u ()(t/2)

and the corresponding limit equation is

(8)

(9)

where

d u(t)
dt

= iv(t)u(t)

v(t) = lim

0

1


v (cid:18) t
2(cid:19)

for a number important models the interaction hamiltonian has the form

v = a + a+

6

where a is a monomial in the creation and annihilation operators. the master eld is given by
the asymptotic behaviour of the collective operator

and its hermitian conjugate. here

a(t) =

a(

t
2 )

a(t) = eith0aeith0

.

the stochastic limit is meant in the sense of the convergence of correlation functions

< a1(t1/)...an(tn/) >. here i = .

entangled commutation relations

in recent years there has been an interest in various modications and deformations of the alge-
bra of canonical commutation relations. especially the simple relations (3) were discussed. an
extension of the algebra (3) has been given in [31] as the algebra describing the interacting fock
space [30] obtained in the stochastic limit for nonrelativistic qed.

in this paper we prove that the stochastic limit of interacting elds, under the only constraint
of momentum conservation leads to a generalization of the algebra (3). we obtain that the new
algebra has as its generators the master eld b(p, k) depending on two momenta p and k and the
operator density of particles n(k) which satisfy the relations

b(p, k)b+(p, k) = n(p)(e(p, k))(p  p)(k  k),

[n(p), b(p, k)] = ((p  p))  (p  p + k))b(p, k),

[n(p), n(p)] = 0

(10)

(11)

(12)

here e(p, k) is the energy associated to the interaction vertex.

we call the relations (10)-(12) entangled commutation relations because, on one hand they
allow to calculate correlations of any order among the eld and, on the other hand they show that
the master elds are not kinematically independent.

where  is the coupling constant. 1.

in the construction of these operators we use the van hove time rescaling t  t/2,   0
one can get a generalization of the algebra (10)-(12) for the multiparticle master eld b(p|k1, ..., kn).
in [31] a generalization of the algebra (3) of the following form has been obtained:

b(k)b+(k) = (k  k)((k) + p  k) ,

(13)
with p being the operator of momenta of particles. this algebra is not realized in the usual fock
space but in the interacting fock space. one can get the algebra (13) from the algebra (10)-(12)
if we set

[ p , b(k)] = kb(k)

1to avoid a discussion of renormalization procedure we assume that there is an ultra-violet cut-o

p = z pn(p)dp, b(k) = z b(p, k)dp

7

these relations show that, contrarily to what happens before the limit, the observables of the
particle do not commute with the master eld. in other words: before the stochastic limit the
particle and the eld are kinematically independent but nonlinearly related by the dynamics; after
the stochastic limit the dynamics is simplied but particle and eld are no longer kinematically
independent: this is what we call entanglement. these new features imply that the algebra (10)-
(12) is not realized in the usual fock space but in the interacting fock space [30].

let us consider the hamiltonian

where the free hamiltonian

h = h0 + v

h0 = z (p)c+(p)c(p)d3p +z (k)a+(k)a(k)d3k,
{c(p), c+(p)} = (p  p), [a(k), a+(k)] = (k  k)

and the interaction hamiltonian:

v = z d3kd3pg(k, p)(c+(p)c(p  k)a(k) + h.c.)

(14)

here g(k, p) is a test function and (p) and (k) are one-particle dispersion laws, for example
(p) = p2/2, (k) = |k|.

the rescaled collective elds in this case have the form

a(p, k, t) =

a+
 (p, k, t) =

where

e(p, k) = (p)  (k)  (p  k)
is the corresponding energy. one has the following main theorem.

as distributions and the limiting operators b = b and b+ satisfy the entangled commutation
relations

[n(p), b(p, k, t)] = ()((p  p)  (p  p + k))b(p, k, t)

[n(p), n(p)] = 0

(21)

here 0 is the vacuum in the new hilbert space, b(p, k, t)qi c+(qi)0 = 0. we use the same

notations for the creation and annihilation operators of c- particles in the original and in the new
hilbert spaces. n(p) is the operator density of the c-particles, n(p) = c+(p)c(p).

if we set

where

then we get the relations (10)

b(p, k, t) = b(t)  b(p, k)

b(t)b+(t) = 2(t  t)

b(p, k)b+(p, k) = n(p)(e(p, k))(p  p)(k  k)

the theorem will be proved in the next section. note that to get non-zero in the rhs of (19)
we have to chose suitable dispersion relations, so that there are non-trivial solutions of equation
e(p, k) = 0. we will discuss this point in sect.6.

5 proof of the theorem

let us consider the matrix elements

h0|c(q)

v

yi=1ai

 (pi, ki, ti)c+(q)|0i

(22)

to evaluate (22) we apply wicks theorem [1] and consider only the corresponding connected
diagrams. each vertex contains 3 lines which are characterized by two momenta (ki, pi). we nd
the momentum corresponding to the 3rd line using the momentum conservation. if a diagram
contains l loops then only l + a + b 1 momenta are independent (l momenta for loop variables
and a + b  1 momenta for the exterior lines).
for every vertex there is the corresponding energy exponent. these energies depend on the
momenta of the lines that enter to the given vertex,

via dispersion laws,

figure 1: diagram with a pair of conjugated vertices

let us consider a connected diagram corresponding to the matrix element (22). the proof
of the theorem consists of three parts. first we prove that only diagrams consisting of pairs of
conjugated vertices dont vanish in the limit   0. next we prove that such diagrams are in
fact non-crossing or half-planar diagrams. and nally we show that the non-crossing diagrams
are described by the entangled commutation relations.

generally, the sets of momenta corresponding to dierent vertices are dierent. however, it
may happens that the same set of momenta corresponds to two dierent vertices. more precisely,
momenta which come in the rst vertex come out from the second one and viceversa.

denition 1. we say that two incident vertices of a given connected diagram are conjugated
if the momenta coming in the rst vertex come out from the second vertex, i.e. the vertices have
the same momenta but with the opposite orientation.

if the ivertex has a conjugated vertex then we denote the latter by i. a typical example of
diagrams containing at least one pair of conjugater vertices is a diagram with a mass insertion
such that this insertion contains a line that does not cross others lines of the diagram (see fig.1).

let us prove the main

lemma 2. if a connected diagram doesnt consist only from pairs of conjugated vertices then

it vanishes in the limit   0 (in the sense of distributions).

proof . to a given diagram, representing a matrix element (22) being integrated over t1, . . . , tv

b and q denotes the set of inde-
pendent momenta associated with the diagram under consideration. ei are given by (23) and
(t, p, q) is a test function.

to evaluate the asymptotic behaviour of this expression when   0 we will make the change
of variables corresponding to the conjugated vertices. notice that for the diagram doesnt vanish,
the number of vertices v should be even, v = 2n. suppose that there are n0 pairs of conjugated
vertices which are denoted {i1,i1, ..., in0,in0}. let us divide the set of all vertices {1, ..., 2n} into

10

two disjoint subsets {i1, i2, . . . , in0, in0+1, ..., in} and {i1,i2, . . . ,in0, in+n0+1, . . . i2n} such that in
every subset there are no conjugated vertices. we denote the corresponding set of time variables
{ti1, ...tin} by t(1) and the set {ti1, ...tin0

, tin+n0+1, ...ti2n} by t(2).

now we perform the following change of variables

or more precisely

(t(1), t(2))  (, t(2))
t(1) = t(2) + 2,

(t(1), t(2)) = (t1, . . . , t2n)  (, t(2)) = (1, . . . , n; tij , j = 1 . . . , n0; tin+r , r = n0 + 1, . . . , n) (26)

note that the second exponent in the expression (30) vanishes since the energies in the conju-

gated vertices are equal.

suppose that in the diagram there are non-conjugated vertices, i.e. n 6= n0. when   0 the
expression (31) goes to zero since, according to our assumption the set of momenta in vertices
ij and in+j, n0 < j  n do not coincide and therefore the functions eij + ein+j as functions of
momenta dont vanish and therefore according the riemann-lebesgue lemma we get zero in the
limit   0.

in the case when n = n0 the exponent in (31) vanishes and generally we get the nonzero

the lemma is proved.

lemma 3. if a connected diagram with two external lines consists only from pairs of conjugated

vertices then it is half-planar, i.e. it can be drown in the half-plane without self intersections.

we will not present here the simple proof of this lemma.

lemma 4. the limiting expression (32) is equal to the rhs of the relation (18).

the proof is obtained by using the algebra (19), (21).

now the theorem follows from the above four lemma.

remark 1. we have considered only matrix elements with two external particles and as a
result the matrix element doesnt vanish only if v is even, v = 2n. in the general case of matrix
elements with an arbitrary number of external lines the number of vertices v can be odd. for
the case of odd v, v = 2n  1, we once again select n vertices and make the following change of
variables

(t1, . . . , t2n1)  (1, . . . , n; tij , j = 1, . . . , n0; tin+r , r = 1, . . . , n  1  n0)

with the i as before (see (27)).

(33)

tij = tij + 2j ,

1  j  n0

tij = tin+j + 2j n0 + 1  j  n  1

tin = 2n

the dierence with the case of even v is that we get an extra factor  in front of the integral

here we use the same schematical notations as in (5). when   0 we neglect the dependence
of  and we get a product of functions. the second exponent goes out. the third exponent
disappears in the case then n0 = n  1, but since we have an extra factor  the expression (8)
always goes to zero as   0.

remark 2. the theorem admits a generalization to the case of an arbitrary number of external

  0 of the wightman correlation functions

(35)

this limit denes the hilbert space in which the master eld lives. for some models the limit of
these correlation functions is trivial (equal to zero). however this doesnt mean that the stochastic
limit of such the model is trivial because we can consider another natural formulation of the
stochastic limit which is dened by the convergence of the chronologically ordered correlation
functions (green functions)

7 stochastic limit and decay

in the formulation of theorem 1 we assumed the special form of the interaction hamiltonian
(14). in local quantum eld theory the typical hamiltonian is more complicated than (14). in
particular, for the yukawa interaction of elds  and  the hamiltonian has the form

h = h0 + v

where h0 is the sum of the free hamiltonians for the fermionic eld  and for the scalar eld 
with relativistic dispersion laws,

and

a(k) = qm2

a + k2,

b(k) = qm2

b + k2

v = z d3xg =

(40)

(41)

here g(k, p) is a test function. this expression is not a well dened operator in the fock space
but it denes a bilinear form. we have the following collective operators

c+(p)c(p  k)a(k) exp

in the limit   0 the operator (44) vanishes because in the correlation functions one gets

(c(p) + a(k) + c(p + k)) = 0

due to the positivity of energy.

the limit of the operator (42) is also zero since for relativistic dispersion laws (40)

(c(p) + a(k)  c(p + k)) = 0

only operator (43) has a chance to be non-zero. in this case we have to nd non-trivial solutions
of

there are solutions if

c(p) + c(k  p) = a(k)

a > 2m2

(45)

i.e. if one has the decay. therefore we obtain that the relativistic interaction hamiltonian (41) is
within the same stochastic universality class as the interaction hamiltonian (14)

v = z d3kd3pg(k, p)(c+(p)c+(k  p)a(k) + h.c.)

(46)

14

in quantum electrodynamics (qed) the interaction has the form

v = z d3xa

if one neglects the spinor and polarization indices then the free hamiltonian has the form (40)
and the interaction hamiltonian has the form (41). we see that the stochastic limit of qed
hamiltonian is reduced to the form of the above discussed hamiltonian and as a result we obtain
the trivial limit, since there is no decay in the standard qed. however, if we consider qed in
external eld we can get a non-zero result due to the change of dispersion law. one of such
examples we will consider in the next section.

8 photon splitting cascades and a new statistics

in the previous section we have seen that the stochastic limit of wightman functions in relativistic
qed is trivial and that it can be non-trivial in the presence of external elds. it is known that
there is the splitting of a photon into two in an external magnetic eld. this splitting is one
of the most interesting manifestations of the nonlinearity of maxwells equations with radiative
corrections in an external magnetic eld. in a constant uniform eld, this process occurs with
conservation of energy and momentum. the process was considered by adler et al. in the early 70s
by using the heisenbergeuler eective lagrangian [34, 35, 36]. photon splitting was considered
as a possible mechanism for the production of linearly polarized gammarays in a pulsar eld.
recently the splitting of photons has found astrophysical applications in the study of annihilation
line suppression in gamma ray pulsars and spectral formation of gamma ray bursts from neutron
stars [37, 38]. photon splitting cascades have also been used in models of soft gamma-ray repeaters,
where they soften the photon spectrum [39, 40]. the process of photon splitting is potentially
important in applications to a possible explanation of the origin of high energy cosmic rays from
active galactic nuclei [41]. a recalculation of the amplitude for photon splitting in a strong
magnetic eld has been performed recently in [42, 43, 44].

we will start from a discussion of the theory of photon splitting cascades and show the emer-
gence of innite statistics in this theory and then discuss its connection with the stochastic limit of
quantum eld theory. in the decay of a photon with momentum k into photons with momentum
k1 and k2, we have conservation of momentum and energy k = k1 + k2 , (k) = 1(k1) + 2(k2).
for photons in vacuum, in the absence of external elds,  = 1 = 2 = k and although these
two equations have a solution the decay is forbidden by the invariance under charge conjugation
(furrys theorem).

in a constant uniform magnetic eld b0 there are only two decay processes kinematically
allowed, k   + and k  k + [35]. here the subscripts  and k will denote polarizations
of the photon with respect to the vector b0. more precisely, in presence of a magnetic eld one
has a distinctive plane, namely the kb0 plane. one takes the linear polarization of the magnetic
eld of the photon parallel and orthogonal to this plane as the two independent polarizations of
the photon, k and , respectively.
the vacuum in the presence of the eld b0 acquires an index of refraction n, and the photon
dispersion relation is modied from k/ = 1 to k/ = n. the indices of refraction nk, can be
calculated from the heisenbergeuler eective lagrangian. adler showed that for subcritical elds
in the limit of weak vacuum dispersion only the splitting mode k  +  operates below pair
0 sin2 
production threshold. for weak dispersion n = 1+ 7

45 , where  = e4h

and  is the angle between k and b0. it is mentioned by harding et al. that in magnetar models
of soft gamma repeaters [38], where supercritical elds are employed, moderate vacuum dispersion
arises. in such a regime, it is not clear whether adlers selection rules still endure since in his
analysis higher order contributions to the vacuum polarization are omitted. in [38] photon cascades
are considered for the case where all three photon splitting modes allowed by cp invariance are
operating. baier et al. [43] have found that there is only one allowed transition (k  + ) for
any magnetic eld. they suggested that a photon cascade could develop only if magnetic eld
changes its direction. it seems that the question on the validity of adlers rule for a non weak
vacuum dispersion deserves a further study. in this work we consider photon cascades when both
kinematically allowed modes (k  +  and k  k+ ) operate.

the interaction operator for the decay k  +  is known to be [36]

v1(t) = 1z (b0e1)(b0e2)(b0b)d3x,

(47)

where the coupling constant 1 = 13e6/3152m8 and magnetic and electric parts of photon eld
are

b = i(4)1/2k  ekei(krt)ak(k), e1 = i(4)1/21eei(k1r1t)a+

(k1)

(48)

and similarly for e2, here  = k(k) and i = (ki), i = 1, 2. here b, b0, ei are three-
dimensional elds and ki are three dimensional vectors.

for the decay k  k+  one has a similar interaction operator with the operator structure

a+(t) = a+

k (p  k)a+

(k)ak(p)eite

(49)

where e = k(p)  k(p  k)  (k). the coupling constant  in this case can be estimated
as /1 = (b0/bcr)2, where  is the ne structure constant,  = e2/hc and bcr = m2c3/eh 
4.4  1013 gauss.
let us consider a photon cascade created by a photon with momentum p and polarization k.
the photon splits as k(p)  (k1) + k(p  k1). then one has the next generation of splitting:
k(p k1)  (k2) + k(p k1  k2) etc. after n generations of splitting one gets a cascade with
n photons with  polarization and momenta k1, k2 . . ., kn and also one photon with k polarization
and momentum k  k1  . . .  kn . an example of a cascade with two generations is shown in
fig.2.
our goal is to consider cascades with real photons (i.e. on the mass shell) including the
intermediate states (compare with what one sees in the wilson camera). these cascades can been

figure 3: non-crossing and crossing diagrams

drawn as shown in fig.2. this diagram is not a feynman one because all the lines (including an
intermediate one) correspond to real particles on the mass shell and not to virtual states. more
precisely all the lines in the diagram are dressed lines on the mass shell and the initial photon
k(k) is prepared in a special way such that it undergoes the decay in a nite time. so we cannot
use the standard s-matrix approach and the standard feynman diagram technique to describe this
process. the diagram is also not a diagram in the noncovariant diagram technique [9] because we
have the conservation of energy at every vertex. the cascade in fig.2 may be intuitively described
by the following state

|(p, k1, k2)i = f (p, k1)f (p  k1, k2)a+

k (p  k1  k2)a+

(k2)a+

(k1)|0i

(50)

where momentum conservation is built in creation and annihilation operators and energy con-
servation is accounted for by the factor f (p, k) = f (k(p)  (k)  k(p  k)) where f () is a
function with support at  = 0. as we shall see below this is not the function but roughly
speaking its square root. indeed, the transition amplitude between two cascade states is given
by scalar product
h(p, k

2)|(p, k1, k2)i = |f (p, k1)|2|f (p  k1, k2)|2(p  p)(k1  k

1)(k2  k

(51)

notice that in the scalar product (51) only the noncrossing diagram fig.3a contributes. in
fact the contribution from the crossing diagram in fig.3b is negligible because of conservation
of energy and momentum. this is the crucial point where the dierence between our diagrams
describing real particles in intermediate states and the feynman diagrams having virtual particles
in intermediate states is manifested. in the feynman diagram technique the amplitude of emission
of the two photons is represented by a sum of two diagrams diering by the order in which the
two photons are emitted. here we have only one diagram, fig.2.
now let us observe that if in (50) we replace the operators a+

(k2) by the quantum
boltzmann operators b(k1) and b(k2) satisfying the relations (1), i.e. b(k)b+
(p) = (k  p),
then it will be automatically guaranteed that only the non-crossing diagrams survive. therefore
it is natural to describe cascade wave functions in terms of these operators. it is well known that
standard free photons are bosons. therefore to see the quantum boltzmann statistics we have
to prepare a special state depending on the interaction. in fact it is natural to expect that the
cascades with physical intermediate states occur at a time scale slower than the one occurring in
the standard s-matrix approach to multiparticle production. a natural method, leading to this
result, is suggested by the stochastic limit technique.

(k1) and a+

now let us consider the question how one can prepare a state which exhibits the new statistics
for photons in cascade. if we would deal with the scattering of 2particle states at innite time (s
matrix) we simply have to consider two feynman diagrams to take into account the bose statistics

17

of photons. however in the cascade we deal with evolution in nite time and the states of photons
(k1) and (k2) are prepared in a special way because they are emitted at times t1 and t2,
respectively. therefore, there is a reason not to add the second diagram. a special procedure
which is adequate to this situation is the stochastic limit technique described in sect.3. in our
case the master eld is given by the asymptotic behaviour of the following collective operator

lim

(k)ak(p)eite/2

= b+(p, k)

(52)

where e is the same as in (49) and as in sect.3  sect.5 the limit is meant in the sense of the
wightman correlation functions.

relations

as it follows from theorem 1 the master eld b(p, k) satises the following commutation
(53)

b(p, k, t)b+(p, k, t) = 2(t  t)(e)(k  k)(p  p)b+

k (k)bk(k)

and bk(p), b+

k (p) satisfy the relations

bk(p)b+

k (p) = (p  p)

(54)

the presence of the (e)-factor (e = k(p)  k(p  k)  (k) ) has two important phys-
ical consequences. first, the commutation relations for the b# are not a consequence of the
corresponding relations for b#
: the three photons are entangled into a single new object
(triphon). second, the triphon creation and annihilation operators b# operate not on the usual
fock space but in interacting fock space.

(k2)bk(k)(2)1/21/2(e)

(55)

(56)

(57)

we can disentangle the master eld by expressing it as a product of individual boltzmannian
elds. here the notation 1/2(e) is purely symbolic and it simply means that, since the new
commutation relation (53) is quadratic in the master creation and annihilation operators, if in
the above symbolic relation we consider the symbol 1/2(e) as a scalar function satisfying the
formal relation [1/2(e)]2 = (e), and if we use the right hand side of (57) to express the left
hand side of (53), then the standard boltzmannian relations (56) and (54) will reduce (53) to
an identity. the intuitive understanding of the disentangling relation (57) is that the triphon
master eld b+(p, k, t) can be expressed as the product of three boltzmannian photons: one
can think that each photon of the triple has its own (boltzmannian) creation and annihilation
operators depending on its own momentum, however in the master eld these operators can only
appear in the combination given by the right hand side of (57) and there is a constraint among
the three momenta expressed by energy conservation.

notice the boltzmannian white noise relation (55), which makes our model particularly suitable
for monte carlo simulations. the origin for these new commutation relations lies in the fact that

18

the crossing diagrams in the computation of the matrix element (50) are suppressed in the weak
coupling/large time limit.

a photon splits into two not only in a magnetic eld but also in a nonlinear medium.

in
fact such processes are well known in nonlinear quantum optics, see for example [12].
in the
nonlinear process of parametric down conversion a high frequency photon splits into two photons
with frequencies such that their sum equals that of the high-energy photon. the two photons
produced in this process possess quantum correlations and have identical intensity uctuations.

in conclusion, in this paper we have argued that photon cascades in a strong magnetic eld
might create a new type of entangled states (triphons) which obey not bose but the quantum
boltzmann statistics. this prediction is based on the assumption that both kinematically allowed
photon splitting modes operate.

given the validity of this assumption we prove that, in the stochastic regime the interme-
diate photons in a cascade are real and virtual particles. the dominating contributions to the
dynamics come from these entangled triples of photons which behave like single new particles
(triphons) whose statistics can be experimentally observed by counting the emitted photons in
the corresponding cascades.

as explained in the introduction, the time scale in which our predictions are true is long
compared to the strength of the coupling but short if compared to the time scale of the smatrix
approach. this remark should be kept into account in a possible experimental verication of these
predictions. a better theoretical understanding of the photon splitting with a non weak dispersion
is required. from the experimental side new more precise devices such as the planned integral
mission [37] might signicantly advance our understanding of the fundamental problem of photon
statistics.
