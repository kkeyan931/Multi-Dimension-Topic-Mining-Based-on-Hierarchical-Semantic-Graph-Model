abstract

three-dimensional n -extended superconformal symmetry is studied within the su-
perspace formalism. a superconformal killing equation is derived and its solutions
are classied in terms of supertranslations, dilations, lorentz transformations, r-
symmetry transformations and special superconformal transformations. supercon-
formal group is then identied with a supermatrix group, osp(n|2, r), as expected
from the analysis on simple lie superalgebras. in general, due to the invariance un-
der supertranslations and special superconformal transformations, superconformally
invariant n-point functions reduce to one unspecied (n  2)-point function which
must transform homogeneously under the remaining rigid transformations, i.e. dila-
tions, lorentz transformations and r-symmetry transformations. after constructing
building blocks for superconformal correlators, we are able to identify all the supercon-
formal invariants and obtain the general form of n-point functions. superconformally
covariant dierential operators are also discussed.

1 introduction and summary

based on the classication of simple lie superalgebras [1], nahm analyzed all possible su-
perconformal algebras [2]. according to ref. [2], not all spacetime dimensions allow the
corresponding supersymmetry algebra to be extended to a superconformal algebra con-
trary to the ordinary conformal symmetry. the standard supersymmetry algebra admits
an extension to a superconformal algebra only if d  6. namely the highest dimension
admitting superconformal algebra is six, and in d = 3, 4, 5, 6 dimensions the bosonic part
of the superconformal algebra has the form

lc  lr ,

(1.1)

where lc is the lie algebra of the conformal group and lr is a r-symmetry algebra acting
on the superspace grassmann variables.

o(2, 6)  sp(n ) ,

,

(1.2)

where n or the number appearing in r-symmetry part is related to the number of super-
charges.

on six-dimensional minkowskian spacetime it is possible to dene weyl spinors of op-
posite chiralities and so the general six-dimensional supersymmetry may be denoted by
two numbers, (n , n ), where n and n are the numbers of chiral and anti-chiral super-
charges. the r-symmetry group is then sp(n )  sp( n ). the analysis of nahm shows
that to admit a superconformal algebra either n or n should be zero. although both
(1, 1) and (2, 0) supersymmetry give rise n = 4 four-dimensional supersymmetry after di-
mensional reduction, only (2, 0) supersymmetry theories can be superconformal [3]. on
ve-dimensional minkowskian spacetime nahms analysis seems to imply a certain restric-
tion on the number of supercharges as the corresponding r-symmetry algebra is to be su(2).

1

the above analysis is essentially based on the classication of simple lie superalgebras
and identication of the bosonic part with the usual spacetime conformal symmetry rather
than poincare symmetry, since the former forms a simple group, while the latter does not.
this approach does not rely on any denition of superconformal transformations on super-
space.

the present paper deals with superconformal symmetry in three-dimensions and lies in
the same framework as our sequent work on superconformal symmetry in other dimensions,
d = 4, 6 [46]. namely we analyze superconformal symmetry directly in terms of coordi-
nate transformations on superspace. we rst dene the superconformal group on superspace
and derive the superconformal killing equation. its general solutions are identied in terms
of supertranslations, dilations, lorentz transformations, r-symmetry transformations and
special superconformal transformations. based on the explicit form of the solutions the
superconformal group is independently identied to agree with nahms analysis and some
representations are obtained.

specically, in ref. [4] we identied four-dimensional n 6= 4 extended superconformal
group with a supermatrix group, su(2, 2|n ), having dimensions (15 + n 2|8n ), while for
n = 4 case we pointed out that an equivalence relation must be imposed on the super-
matrix group and so the four-dimensional n = 4 superconformal group is isomorphic to a
quotient group of the supermatrix group. in fact n = 4 superconformal group is a semi-
direct product of u(1) and a simple lie supergroup containing su(4). the u(1) factor
can be removed by imposing tracelessness condition on the supermatrix group so that the
dimension reduces from (31|32) to (30|32) and the r-symmetry group shrinks from u(4) to
nahms result, su(4)1. in ref. [6] by solving the superconformal killing equation we show
that six-dimensional (n , 0) superconformal group is identied with a supermatrix group,
osp(2, 6|n ), having dimensions (28 + n (2n + 1)|16n ), while for (n , n ), n , n > 0 su-
persymmetry, we veried that although dilations may be introduced, there exist no special
superconformal transformations as expected from nahms result.

the main advantage of our formalism is that it enables us to write general expression
for two-point, three-point and n-point correlation functions of quasi-primary superelds
which transform simply under superconformal transformations. in refs. [46] we explicitly
constructed building blocks for superconformal correlators in four- and six-dimensions, and

1similarly if ve-dimensional superconformal group is not simple, this will be a way out from the puzzling
restriction on the number of supercharges in ve-dimensional superconformal theories, as the corresponding
r-symmetry group can be bigger than nahms result, su(2). however this is at the level of speculation at
present.

proved that these building blocks actually generate the general form of correlation func-
tions. in general, due to the invariance under supertranslations and special superconformal
transformations, n-point functions reduce to one unspecied (n  2)-point function which
must transform homogeneously under the rigid transformations only - dilations, lorentz
transformations and r-symmetry transformations [4]. this feature of superconformally in-
variant correlation functions is universal for any spacetime dimension if there exists a well
dened superinversion in the corresponding dimension, since superinversion plays a crucial
role in its proof. for non-supersymmetric case, contrary to superinversion, the inversion
map is dened of the same form irrespective of the spacetime dimension and hence n-point
functions reduce to one unspecied (n2)-point function in any dimension which transform
homogeneously under dilations and lorentz transformations.

the formalism is powerful for applications whenever there exist o-shell supereld for-
mulations for superconformal theories, and such formulations are known in four-dimensions
for n = 1, 2, 3 [711] and in three-dimensions for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 [1219]. in fact within the
formalism osborn elaborated the analysis of n = 1 superconformal symmetry for four-
dimensional quantum eld theories [20], and recently kuzenko and theisen determine the
general structure of two- and three- point functions of the supercurrent and the avour cur-
rent of n = 2 superconformal eld theories [21]. a common result contained in refs. [20,21]
is that the three-point functions of the conserved supercurrents in both n = 1 and n = 2
superconformal theories allow two linearly independent structures and hence there exist
two numerical coecients which can be calculated in specic perturbation theories using
supergraph techniques.

the contents of the present paper are as follows. in section 2 we review supersymmetry
in three-dimensions.
in particular, we verify that supersymmetry algebra with n dirac
supercharges is equivalent to 2n-extended majorana supersymmetry algebra, so that in
the present paper we consider n -extended majorana superconformal symmetry with an
arbitrary natural number, n .

in section 3, we rst dene the three-dimensional n -extended superconformal group
in terms of coordinate transformations on superspace as a generalization of the denition
of ordinary conformal transformations. we then derive a superconformal killing equation,
which is a necessary and sucient condition for a supercoordinate transformation to be
superconformal. the general solutions are identied in terms of supertranslations, dila-
tions, lorentz transformations, r-symmetry transformations and special superconformal
transformations, where r-symmetry is given by o(n ) as in eq.(1.2). we also present a def-
inition of superinversion in three-dimensions through which supertranslations and special

3

superconformal transformations are dual to each other. the three-dimensional n -extended
superconformal group is then identied with a supermatrix group, osp(n|2, r), having
dimensions (10 + 1
2n (n  1)|4n ) as expected from the analysis on simple lie superalge-
bras [2, 22].

in section 4, we obtain an explicit formula for the nite non-linear superconformal
transformations of the supercoordinates, z, parameterizing superspace and discuss several
representations of the superconformal group. we also construct matrix or vector valued
functions depending on two or three points in superspace which transform covariantly un-
der superconformal transformations. for two points, z1 and z2, we nd a matrix, i(z1, z2),
which transforms covariantly like a product of two tensors at z1 and z2. for three points,
z1, z2, z3, we nd tangent vectors, zi, which transform homogeneously at zi, i = 1, 2, 3.
these variables serve as building blocks of obtaining two-point, three-point and general
n-point correlation functions later.

in section 5, we discuss the superconformal invariance of correlation functions for quasi-
primary superelds and exhibit general forms of two-point, three-point and n-point func-
tions. explicit formulae for two-point functions of superelds in various cases are given.
we also identify all the superconformal invariants.

in section 6, superconformally covariant dierential operators are discussed. the condi-
tions for superelds, which are formed by the action of spinor derivatives on quasi-primary
superelds, to remain quasi-primary are obtained.
in general, the action of dierential
operator on quasi-primary elds generates an anomalous term under superconformal trans-
formations. however, with a suitable choice of scale dimension, we show that the anomalous
term may be cancelled. we regard this analysis as a necessary step to write superconfor-
mally invariant actions on superspace, as the kinetic terms in such theories may consist of
superelds formed by the action of spinor derivatives on quasi-primary superelds.

in the appendix, the explicit form of superconformal algebra and a method of solving

the superconformal killing equation are exhibited.

3 superconformal symmetry in three-dimensions

in this section we rst dene the three-dimensional superconformal group on superspace
and then discuss its superconformal killing equation along with the solutions.

3.1 superconformal group & killing equation

the superconformal group is dened here as a group of superspace coordinate transforma-
tions, z
up to a local scale factor, so that

g z, that preserve the innitesimal supersymmetric interval length, e2 = ee,

e2(z)  e2(z) = 2(z; g)e2(z) ,

where (z; g) is a local scale factor.
this requires b

a(z) = 0

dax + ibdab = 0 .

and

hence rm

e(z) = e(z)r

(z; g) ,

r 

 (z; g)r 

 (z; g) = 2(z; g) ,

det r(z; g) = 3(z; g) .

a =  a ,
a = a ,

innitesimally from eq.(2.24) r

h = x  iaa .
 is of the form

so that the condition (3.4) reduces to the ordinary conformal killing equation

h + h   .

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

we note that eq.(3.10) follows from eq.(3.6). using the anti-commutator relation for
da (2.20) we get from eqs.(3.6,3.7,a.1a)

and hence

a

bh = 1

2(cid:16) da(b)  (dba)(cid:17) ,
a (h + h) = ( dab  dba) ,
 b

(3.12)

which implies eq.(3.10). thus eq.(3.6) or eq.(3.7) is a necessary and sucient condition for
a supercoordinate transformation to be superconformal.

3.2 extended superconformal transformations

in summary, the generators of superconformal transformations in three-dimensions act-
ing on the three-dimensional superspace, r3|2n , with coordinates, zm = (x, a), can be
classied as

1. supertranslations, a, 

x = a  iaa ,

a = a .

(3.24)

this is consistent with eq.(2.15).

2. dilations, 

x = x ,

a = 1

as we consider innitesimal transformations we obtain so(n ) as r-symmetry group.
however nitely r-symmetry group can be extended to o(n ) which leaves the supertrans-
lation invariant one form (2.16) invariant manifestly.

4 coset realization of transformations

in this section, we rst obtain an explicit formula for the nite non-linear superconformal
transformations of the supercoordinates and discuss several representations of the super-
conformal group. we then construct matrix or vector valued functions depending on two
or three points in superspace which transform covariantly under superconformal transfor-
mations. these variables serve as building blocks of obtaining two-point, three-point and

4.1 superspace as a coset

to obtain an explicit formula for the nite non-linear superconformal transformations, we
rst identify the superspace, r3|2n , as a coset, gs/g0, where g0  gs is the subgroup
generated by matrices, m0, of the form (3.45) with a = 0, a = 0 and depending on
parameters b, a, , w, ta
b. the group of supertranslations, gt , parameterized by coor-
dinates, zm  r3|2n , has been dened by general elements as in eq.(2.11) with the group
property given by eqs.(2.14, 2.15). now we may represent it by supermatrices5

gt (z) = exp

note gt (z)1 = gt (z).

in general an element of gs can be uniquely decomposed as gt g1
element g(g)  gs we may dene a superconformal transformation, z
associated element g0(z; g)  g0 by

0 . thus for any
g z, and an

g(g)1gt (z)g0(z; g) = gt (z) .

if g(g)  gt then clearly g0(z; g) = 1. innitesimally eq.(4.2) becomes

gt (z) = mgt (z)  gt (z) m0(z) ,

where m is given by eq.(3.45) and m0(z), the generator of g0, has the form

m0(z) =

4.2 finite transformations

finite superconformal transformations can be obtained by exponentiation of innitesimal
transformations. to obtain a superconformal transformation, z

zm
t = lm (zt) ,

z0 = z ,

z1 = z ,

(4.21)

where, with l given in eq.(3.41), lm (z) is dened by
l = lm (z)m .

from eq.(4.13) we get

d
dt

z(zt) = mz(zt)  z(zt)h(zt) ,

z(zt) = etm z(z)k(z, t) ,

which integrates to

where k(z, t) satises

hence for t = 1 with k(z, 1)  k(z; g), z

z(z) = g(g)1z(z)k(z; g) ,

g(g)1 = em .

(4.26)

g0(z; g) in eq.(4.2) is related to k(z; g) from eq.(4.26) by

g0(z; g)z0 = z0k(z; g) .

in general k(z; g) is of the form

5 superconformal invariance of correlation functions

in this section we discuss the superconformal invariance of correlation functions for quasi-
primary superelds and exhibit general forms of two-point, three-point and n-point func-
tions without proof, as the proof is essentially identical to those in our earlier work [4, 5].

5.1 quasi-primary superelds

we rst assume that there exist quasi-primary superelds, i(z), which under the super-
conformal transformation, z

g z, transform as

i  i ,

i(z) = j (z)d i

j (z; g) .

(5.1)

d(z; g) obeys the group property so that under the successive superconformal transforma-
tions, g : z

g

g z

 z, it satises

d(z; g)d(z; g) = d(z; g) ,

(5.2)

and hence

d(z; g)1 = d(z; g1) .

(5.3)
we choose here d(z; g) to be a representation of so(1, 2) o(n ) d, which is a subgroup
of the stability group at z = 0, and so we decompose the spin index, i, of superelds into
so(1, 2) index, , and o(n ) index, r, as i  
(l(z; g))dr

i(z; g) is factorized as

s(u(z; g))(z; g) ,

i(z; g) = d

r. now dj

(5.7)

(5.8)

it is useful to consider the conjugate supereld of 

r, 

r(z), which transforms as



r(z) = (z; g)d

s(u1(z; g))

as examples, we rst consider real scalar, spinorial and gauge superelds,

s(z), (z), (z),  a(z), a(z). they satisfy

s(z) = s(z) ,

(z) = 1(z) = (0(z)) ,

(5.14)

imply that k(z1(1),   ,z1(n2)) is a function of the superconformal invariants and further-
more that all of the superconformal invariants can be generated by contracting the indices
of z m

b solution of superconformal killing equation

from the well known solution of the ordinary conformal killing equation (3.10) [26], we
may write the general solution of the superconformal killing equation (3.15) as

h(z) = 2xb() x  (x2  1

4(aa)2)b() + 

xb()aa

+w

()x + 1

4

w()aa + ()x + a() .

(b.1)

substituting this expression into eq.(3.15) leads three independent equations corresponding
to the second, rst and zeroth order in x. considering the quadratic terms or the coecients
of xx, we get

dab() + dab()  dab()
= i 1
2 

(dab() + dab()  dab()) .



(b.2)

37

contracting this with  gives

while contraction with  leads

dab() = i 1
2 



dab() ,

thus

dab() = i 1

3



dab() .

dab() = 0 ,

(b.3)

(b.4)

(b.5)
4(aa)2)b +

b() is constant. straightforward calculation shows that 2xb x  (x2  1
xb aa is a solution of the superconformal killing equation (3.15).


now the linear in x terms become

da(v() + ()) = i 1

2 da(v()  v()  

())

 ,

(b.6)

where v() is the dual form of w()

v = 1

2

w ,

w = v .

(b.7)

contracting eq.(b.6) with  gives

da() = i 1

3dav

() ,

v

() = v()



 .

(b.8)

substituting this back into eq.(b.6) leads

0 = 5dav()  idav

() + 4idav() 

  idav()

 .

(b.9)

contraction with 

 shows that v() satises the superconformal killing equation (3.15)

eqs.(b.8,b.10) are actually equivalent to eq.(b.6), since from eq.(b.10) successively

dav() = i 1
2 

dav() 

 .

dav()

 = i 1

(b.11)

dav[()]

and the last expression makes eq.(b.9) hold.

(b.15)

dbdav

() = 2

3

dbdav

()  1

3 

dbdav

which is in fact equivalent to eq.(b.13).

from eq.(b.15) and dbdav

() = dadbv

() we get

2

dbdav

() + 2

dadbv

() = 

(dadbv

() + dbdav

()) .

(b.16)

contracting with 

 gives

3dbdav

() = 2dadbv

() + dadbv

() .

(b.17)

hence from eq.(b.14) we can put

dbdav

 = ab() ,

ab() = 1

2 dbda(v()1) = ba() ,

(b.18)

so that eq.(b.15) becomes with eq.(a.6)

dbdav

() = 1

3(2

  
39

)ab() .

(b.19)

thus

dcab() = 1

2 dbdadc(v()1)

= 1

2 dbca()

= 0 .

therefore ab() is independent of  and v() is at most quadratic in .
from eq.(b.19) we get

integrating this gives

where 6ita

b = ab so that

dbdav

() = ab .

dav

() = 6i(ta

b b + a) ,

and the spinor, a, appears as a constant of integration.
now eq.(b.12) becomes with eq.(2.4)

tt = t ,

integrating this gives

eq.(b.8) becomes

so that

dav

() = 2i(ta

b b + a)



 .

v() = ita

b ba + 2iaa + v .

da() = 2ta

b b  2a ,

dbda() = i 1

3 ab .

however from dbda() + dadb() = 0 we note ab = 0. hence

w() = a(  )a + w ,

() = 2aa +  .

with these expressions straightforward calculation shows that w
()x is a solution of the superconformal killing equation (3.15).

the general solution of which we already obtained. from eq.(b.25)

a() = ita

b ba + 2iaa + a .

(b.30)

for a() to be real t must be anti-hermitian and hence with eq.(b.23) t  o(n ).

all together, we obtain the general solution of the superconformal killing equation (3.17).
