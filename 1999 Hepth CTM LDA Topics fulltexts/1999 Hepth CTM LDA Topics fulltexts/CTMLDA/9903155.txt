(23) observation relates induced charges anomalies. let us note passing phenomenon discussed section 3 may understood language follows. background eld m(x) introduced, phase 15 u(x) rotated away, remain massless fermions interacting background eld al(x). situation adiabatic process necessarily end ground state, energy levels massless fermions may cross zero. case baryon number induced ground state background eld al (x) = uiu 1(x) would dierent eq. (23), anomaly determines total change baryon number. reason dependence induced charges parameters theory (m0/0 example section 3). one may wonder whether similar phenomenon (fermion level crossing) might occur even relevant fundamental fermions obtain masses upon introducing background scalar elds, i.e., whether nal state might actually contain excitations carrying non-zero net baryon number. argue happen, let us consider qcd again. appearance, nal state, excitations non-zero net baryon number would show non-vanishing index four-dimensional euclidean dirac operator d = (cid:16)d + 1 5 2 al(x)(cid:17)+m0, vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude would vanish matrix elements baryon number violating operators initial nal vacua would not. however, arbitrary gluon elds, eigenvalues operator d = +m0 obey || > m0 (the euclidean operator anti-hermitean) operator d zero modes background elds al(x) small (al(x) m0 x) slowly vary space-time. argument implies eq. (23) valid full quantum theory even m0 < qcd. although situation theories fundamental scalars complicated, likely analogous arguments may designed theories well. finally, adiabatic process may considered within low energy eective theory. induced baryon number related anomaly eective theory, provided low energy degrees freedom interacting su(n0)l gauge elds become massive upon introducing mass m0 n0 avors fundamental quarks. u(1)b su(n0)l su(n0)r anomalies fundamental low energy theories, 16 induced baryon numbers match automatically case. observation obvious generalization: sucient condition induced charge matching low energy degrees freedom transforming non-trivially subgroup avor group remain massless subgroup explicitly broken masses fermions fundamental theory. property certainly valid supersymmetric theories phase transition expected occur masses avors ow small large values, i.e., massive avors smoothly decouple. hand, property seem guaranteed non-supersymmetric models, though intuitively appealing may well quite generic. authors indebted e. akhmedov, d. amati, g. dvali, yu. kubyshin, a. ku- znetsov, v. kuzmin, a. penin, k. selivanov, a. smirnov, p. tinyakov s. troitsky numerous helpful discussions. research supported part russian foundation basic research grant 99-02-18410. work s.d. d.g. supported part intas grant 96-0457 within research program international center fundamental physics moscow issep fellowships. work s.d., d.g., m.l supported part russian academy sciences, jrp grant 37. v.r. would like thank professor miguel virasoro hopsitality abdus salam international center theoretical physics, part work carried out.
