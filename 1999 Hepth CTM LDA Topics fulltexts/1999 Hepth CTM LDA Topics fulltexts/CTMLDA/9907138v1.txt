abstract

generalized brs transformations such as introduced in part i are applied to a model

of quantum gravity. this development is technically complex; but at the least should

illustrate how much less rigid and more general of application are the new brs transf

ormations.

iii. formulation of the generalized brs transformations in a quantum gravity model.

we turn to the model of quantum gravity presented in [5], with a covariant action

in euclidean space and the metric expressed non-linearly in terms of the real symmetric

matrix a(x) by

we start from the gauge condition

g(x) = (cid:16)ea(x)(cid:17)

.

a(x) = 0

(23)

(24)

and then pass in the usual way to the use of a gauge xing term (setting a(x) = f(x)

and then smearing over the f). we write the action as

the basic action s1 is covariant and given by

s = s1 + s2 + s3

s1 = z g(r2 + rr)

s2 the gauge xing term is as follows:

s2 =



2 z (a)()( a)

innitesimal transformations of g are given by

g  g + g + g  + (g)

= g

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

where g is dened by (28)-(29). s1 is invariant under this transformation. before we
dene the ghost action s3 we need some notation. we use quaternions as follows:

{~} = {~i,~i, ~k}
 = 0 +~ix + ~jy + ~kz
 ~
 = ~   .

quaternion multiplication is understood in (32). thus

~i


 = 0~i  x + ~ky  ~jz

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

and so (using (31) and (33))

note

~i
0 = x

~i
1 = 0


~i
2 = z

~i
3 = y .


~i
 = 0 .


we introduce six real symmetric 3  3 matrices m i

~~

, i = 1, ..., 6. and require

tr(m i m j) = ij .

(34)

(35)

(36)

the application of quaternions we are making is modelled from constructions in [7].

we now proceed to the development of the ghost action s3, realizing the fadeev-
popov determinant, for a functional integral with respect to the variables a. the ghost
elds will be c, c,  = 0, ..., 3 and di, di, i = 1, ..., 6. we dene f by

g
a 

=

 (cid:17)
 + f  

and introduce a number of dierential operators

in eq. (38) and (39) j = 1, ..., 6 and in eq. (40) and (41)  = 0, .., 3. we also will use

~

l(2)j

l(3)

from the l( ) are constructed the following bilinear dierential operators:

t 

 = x,
bij = x,
rj = x,
 = x,

j



 l(4)
l(3) 
l(2)i
 l(1)j
l(3)
 l(1)j
 l(4)
l(2)j







these enable us to write the ghost action conveniently:

s3 = (t + r + l + b)

with:

t = z c t 
 c
b = z dibij dj
r = z crjdj
l = z djj
c

it is sometimes helpful to form the bilinear operators in a block matrix

bl = 


t



r

b

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

we can studying (53) easily see that if f  



is set zero the ghost action is the same as

the usual expression (i.e. if a = g then the fadeev-popov determinant is the usual

one).

the generalized brs transformations may now be written down, generated by

(x) = c(x) +zy

f 
 (x, y)c(y)

(54)

here f is an essentially arbitrary formal series in the a. one could add to eq. (54) a

similar term to the last linear in di(y); for simplicity we do not (it is straightforward to

4

modify succeeding relations to accommodate this). the tr ansformations follow:

g(x)  g(x) + g(x)(x)
di(x)  di(x) +(cid:18) 
(cid:19) di(x)
c(x)  c(x) +(cid:18)
di(x)  di(x) +zyzz

we will nd it convenient to dene f by

a = g + f  

 g 

(55)

(56)

(57)

(58)

(59)

(60)

where a and g are of course the changes in a and g under the brs transformation. f
is entirely determined from eq. (23) as

f  

 (x) =

a (x)
g (x)

 .

(61)

similarly to the yang-mills case, the functions d, g, w, x, y, z will have to satisfy certain

relations specied in the next section.

iv. relations ensuring s  j = 0.

we use the notation of equations (12)-(14). in the present case there are terms in

s  j of six types. we require

si  ji = 0,

i = 1, . . . , 6 .

(62)

the six types of terms contain expressions of the following form, in an obvious notation:

5

1) d

2) c

3) d c d

4) c c d

5) c c c

6) d c c

we proceed to list the required relations, each obtained by a tedious but direct compu-

tation.

in the second from last term in (64) the subscripts y indicate the operators and functions

are evaluated as functions and operators in variable y. in the next to last term in (64)
we wish the functional derivative to be evaluated before the derivativ es in g.

in the remaining cases, i  3, ji = 0. before we proceed individually to these
cases, it is convenient to work out some results that will be used in all these cases. we
study the eects of the brs transformation (54)-(59) on g a nd f . we get

f ab

 (x, y)c(y) .

(66)

(67)

where p (1) is a rst order dierential operator dened by these equations. in computing
the change in g and the conditions to follow we may omit the rst term on the right side
of (54) and the second term on the right side of (59) as can celling each other. we then

may write

d(x)  d(x) +zzzy

(x  y)p (2)

(x, y)f 

 (y, z)c(z)

(68)

where p (2) is a dierential operator rst order in each variable dened implicitly by this

equation (and straightforward to compute).

(72)

f is known, functions d, g, w, x, y, z are solved for each as formal power series in
the a,. suppose all the functions are known through nth order terms. in the inductive
procedure we then write the (n + 1)st order parts of the six condition equations. the

six resultant equations (each homogenous of degree n + 1) contain respectively a single

term in the(n + 1)st order part of d, g, w, y, z, x the principal term and all the rest
of the terms in each equat ion are expressible in terms of the terms of degree  n already
known of the functions involved (and f ). the principal term arises as the rst term in

the condition equation, or part of the rst term. thus for example in the rst equation
2di gives rise to the principal term, and in the second equation the rst term contains
( + )g the principal term. our six equations in six unknown functions can

thus be inductively solved as formal power series. convergence properties are not here

studied. the most important direction of further work is incorporation of these results

into a renormalization scheme for the model.
