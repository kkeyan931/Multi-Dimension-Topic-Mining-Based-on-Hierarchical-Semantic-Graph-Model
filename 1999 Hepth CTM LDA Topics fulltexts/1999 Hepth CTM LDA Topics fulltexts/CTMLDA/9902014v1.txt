abstract

it has been shown in literature that a possible mechanism of mass generation
for gauge elds is through a topological coupling of vector and tensor elds. after
integrating over the tensor degrees of freedom, one arrives at an eective massive
theory that, although gauge invariant, is nonlocal. here we quantize this nonlocal
resulting theory both by path integral and canonical procedures. this system can
be considered as equivalent to one with an innite number of time derivatives and
consequently an innite number of momenta. this means that the use of the canon-
ical formalism deserves some care. we show the consistency of the formalism we use
in the canonical procedure by showing that the obtained propagators are the same
as those of the (lagrangian) path integral approach. the problem of nonlocality
appears in the obtainment of the spectrum of the theory. this fact becomes very
transparent when we list the innite number of commutators involving the elds
and their velocities.

1 introduction

it is widely accepted that the forces of nature are described by gauge theories. these
theories are characterized by the gauge symmetries which are related to massless
elds. however, sometimes it is necessary that these elds become massful, as it
occurs, for instance, in the case of the salam-weinberg theory. nowadays, it has
also been widely accepted that spontaneous symmetry breaking together with the
higgs mechanism are the most probable explanation for the origin of the acquisition
of mass by gauge elds. however, if this is actually true, the higgs bosons must
exist in nature. the point is that there is no precise theoretical prediction on the
mass scale where these elds could be found and experiments till now have shown
no evidence about them.

in this way, alternative mechanisms of mass generation for gauge elds that do
not spoil what is well established and that do not contain higgs bosons are welcome.
this might be the case of vector-tensor gauge theories [1], where vector and tensor
elds are coupled in a topological way by means of a kind of chern-simons term.
the general idea of this mechanism resides in the following: tensor gauge elds [2]
are antisymmetric quantities and consequently in d = 4 they exhibit six degrees
of freedom. by virtue of the massless condition, the number of degrees of freedom
goes down to four. since the gauge parameter is a vector quantity, this number
would be zero if all of its components were independent. this is nonetheless the
case because the system is reducible (which means that the gauge transformations
are not all independent) and we mention that the nal number of physical degrees
of freedom is one. it is precisely this degree of freedom that can be absorbed by
the vector gauge eld in the vector-tensor gauge theory in order to acquire mass
[1, 3]. this peculiar structure of constraints involving tensor gauge theories implies
that quantization as well as its non-abelian formulation deserve some care and a
reasonable amount of work has been done on these subjects [4, 5, 6, 7].

usually, the treatment of the vector-tensor gauge theory is carried out with both
vector and tensor elds placed together and just at the end the integration over the
tensor eld is done in order to obtain the eective result for the vector theory.
this procedure usually hides an important aspect of this eective theory, that is its
nonlocality. we mention that it is equivalent to a theory with an innite number
of higher derivative terms and, consequently, an innite number of momenta also.

it is not our purpose here to advocate if a vector-tensor gauge theory with
topological coupling is more suitable to explain the mass generation than the usual
spontaneous symmetry breaking together with the higgs mechanism. our inten-
tion in the present paper is to study the quantization of massive vector gauge eld
directly by means of the nonlocal eective lagrangian [8]. we do it both by path in-
tegral, where we use a lagrangian formulation, as well as by the canonical approach.
this is the subject of sections 2 and 3 respectively. we would like also to add that
the non-abelian formulation for the vector tensor gauge theory is not a simple task.
this is so because the non-abelian version loses the reducibility condition unless
we consider that the maxwell stress tensor as zero [6]. another possibility is to

2

introduce a kind of stuckelberg eld, that disappears in the abelian limit, in order
to keep the same number of degrees of freedom in both sectors (abelian and non-
abelian) of the theory [7]. we shall consider only the abelian case in this paper.
we left sec. 4 for some concluding remarks and include four appendices to present
details of some calculations.

2 brief review of the vector-tensor gauge the-
ory and the path integral quantization of the
eective vector theory

the abelian theory for vector and tensor elds coupled in a topological way is
described by the lagrangian density [1]:

l = 

1
4

f f  +

1
12

h h  +

m
2

 bf ,

(2.1)

where f and h are totally antisymmetric tensors written in terms of the po-
tentials a and b (also antisymmetric) through the stress tensors

f = a   a ,

h = b + b +  b .

(2.2)

(2.3)

in expression (2.1),  is the totally antisymmetric symbol and m is a mass
parameter. it is easy to see, by using the (coupled) euler-lagrange equations for
a and b, as well as the jacobi identity, that f satisfy a massive klein-gordon
equation, with a mass parameter m [1].

we observe that the lagrangian (2.1) is invariant under the gauge transforma-

tions

a =  ,
b =     ,

(2.4)

(2.5)

where  and  are (before xing the gauge) generic functions of spacetime. this
is a reducible theory, what means that not all the gauge transformations above are
independent. in fact, if we choose the gauge parameter  as the gradient of some
scalar  we have that b does not change under the gauge transformation (2.5).

functionally integrating over the antisymmetric tensor eld b we get, after a

convenient gauge xing procedure, the eective action [3]

3

s0 [a] = 

1

4z d4x f(cid:16)1 +

m2

2 (cid:17) f  .

(2.6)

the action (2.6), although nonlocal, is gauge invariant. it is important to emphasize
that this theory is renormalizable, a characteristic that is lost when a mass term is
directly put by hand as in the proca theory.

let us calculate the (covariant) propagator for the eld a. we opt to use a
lagrangian formulation in order to avoid the problem of the innite number of mo-
menta. let us use the batalin-vilkovisky (bv) formalism [5, 9]. the nonminimum
bv action can be written as

s = s0 +z dx (a

 c + b c) ,

(2.7)

 and the pair (c, c) are respectively the antields of the gauge eld
where the a
a and of the ghosts (c, c). the auxiliary eld b was introduced in order to x
the gauge in a covariant way. this can be done, for instance, with the aid of the
gauge-xing fermion functional

 = z dx c ( b + a) ,

with  being a parameter. the vacuum functional is dened by [5, 9]

z = z [da][dc][dc][db][da

][dc][dc] h 



i exp {is} .

(2.8)

(2.9)

the action s is given by (2.7) and  is generically referring to gauge and ghost
elds. after functionally integrating over the antields as well as over the auxiliary
eld b, we arrive at

s [j] = z d4xh

2 (cid:16)a(cid:17)2

+ jai ,

(2.10)

where we have introduced an external source j  in order to calculate the propagator.
this can be directly obtained by a straightforward calculation. the result, written
in momentum space, is

k  = 

1

k2 + m2 h +(cid:16)   1
k2 +

m2

k4 (cid:17) kki .

(2.11)

we notice that there is actually a mass pole at k2

0 = ~k2 + m2.

in the next section we are going to see how this and other features appear in

terms of a canonical quantization procedure.

3 canonical quantization

let us consider the lagrangian for vector elds of eq. (2.10)

l =

f (cid:16)1 +

m2

2 (cid:17) f  

1

2 (cid:16)a(cid:17)2

.

(3.1)

to implement the process of canonical quantization for such system, it is necessary
to obtain the canonical momenta. so, we have to isolate the time derivatives from
the nonlocal operator 21. we then conveniently write

(3.2)

as one observes, the system described by (3.1) is eectively a system with an
innite number of time derivatives and consequently it contains an innite number
of momenta [10, 11]. a practical way of obtaining the momentum expressions is to
consider the variation of the action by xing the elds and their velocities at just
one of the extreme times, say, a(~x, t0) = 0 =  a(~x, t0) =  a(~x, t0) =   . after
some algebraic calculation, we get (please, see appendix a)

systems with higher derivatives have elds and their velocities as independent
coordinates. for example, a system with two derivatives has its elds (denoting
them generically by ) and their velocities  as independent coordinates. if there
are no constraints in the theory, the poisson brackets (p.b.) are the bridge to the
quantum commutator. thus, we must have [, ] = 0. the commutators that might
not be zero are those (in this example with two derivatives) involving  and  with
the higher derivatives  and

 [11].

the problem that comes out in the system we are studying is that there is an
innite number of time derivatives and it is not clear a priori which commutators are
not zero. in order to try to gure them out we take the lagrangian (3.1), expanded
in t derivatives, till a certain limit order n and at the end we let n goes to innity.
let us then consider the expansion (3.2) till 2
t , which is the rst nontrivial order,

in this order, the phase-space coordinate is given by (a,  )  ( a, (1) ) 
( a, (2) ). we thus observe that relations (3.9) and (3.10) are constraints, as
well as the zero component of . the fundamental nonvanishing p.b. are

{a(~x, t),  (~y, t)} = 
{ a(~x, t), (1) (~y, t)} = 
{ a(~x, t), (2) (~y, t)} = 

 (~x  ~y) ,
 (~x  ~y) ,
 (~x  ~y) .

(3.11)

in order to calculate the p.b. matrix of the constraints, it is convenient to develop
them separating all the velocities. the result is

t0 = 0 +(cid:16) 1

(3.14)

we observe that the last constraint for  = 0 becomes t (2)
0 . we also observe
that the other constraints do not contain a0 and consequently the p.b. matrix for
the constraints above will be singular (in fact, a0 does not play any role in the
theory). thus, instead of the constraint (3.14), we take

0 = (2)

with this inverse, we directly obtain the following dirac brackets (d.b.) [12]

{ a(~x, t), a (~y, t)}d =  i




0 (~x  ~y) ,

the bracket {

the commutators follow directly from expressions (3.18) and (3.19), i.e.

[ a(~x, t), a (~y, t)] = i  0
[ a(~x, t), a (~y, t)] = i  i
...
a (~x, t), a (~y, t)] =  i

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

it might be opportune and instructive to call our attention for the following fact.
we notice that from the rst commutator above we get [ ai(~x, t), aj(~y, t)] = 0. since
there is no dependence of this result with the mass parameter m, it may appear
that there is a conict with the limit case when m  0, where the maxwell theory is
obtained. we know that this commutator is not zero in the maxwell theory. what
happens it that in the limit of m  0, the structure of constraints is not the same
as in the massful case, and consequently, the results we obtain in one sector cannot
be kept in the other. we nd important to explain this point with details in order
to reinforce the formalism we are using. we use the appendix c to do this.

let us now consider the propagator calculation. one can directly show by using
the path integral formalism that the propagator corresponds to the inverse of the
operator that appears in the equation of motion. considering (3.7), we have

(cid:26)(cid:20)1 (cid:16)1 +

 1 +(cid:16)1 +

2
t

2(cid:17) m2

2(cid:21) (cid:27) a = 0 .

this means that the propagator must satises the equation

if what we have done till now is consistent, that is to say,
if the quantization
embodied in the commutators (3.20), the expression (3.22) ought to be veried.

in fact, after a hard algebraic calculation, we show that this actually occurs (see
appendix d for some details).

let us now consider the lagrangian with the next term of the expansion of 21,

with these constraints, we calculate the d.b. involving elds and their velocities,
in the same way we have done in the previous approximation. the quantization of
the present approximation is expressed by the following commutators:




0 (~x  ~y) ,
0 k (~x  ~y) ,

[ a(~x, t), a (~y, t)] = i  0
[ a(~x, t), a (~y, t)] = i  k

where
a stands for ve time derivatives over a. using the commutators above,
one can also show that the propagator satises a similar relation like (3.23) with
the operator that appears in the equation of motion (3.25). this shows that the
commutators above are also consistent relations.

now it is not dicult to infer the commutator relations when all the terms of

the operator 21 are taken into account. these are given by




0 (~x  ~y) ,
0 k (~x  ~y) ,

[ a(~x, t), a (~y, t)] = i  0

we see in this way that the canonical structure, despite its nonlocality, is per-
fectly consistent with the functional procedure, generating propagators for the vec-
torial theory which display the presence of a massive eld. to develop the theory
furthermore, trying to construct the fock space by introducing creation and anni-
hilation operators for the vectorial elds, this seems to be nontrivial. this is so
because there is no way, if m does not vanish, to avoid a canonical dependence
between the vectorial eld and its derivative of order 2n  1, in the limit when n
goes to innity. we may say that the set of equations (3.28) shows us where the
nonlocability problem appears in the process of quantization of these theories.

4 conclusion

in this work we have considered the quantization of a nonlocal massive vector gauge
invariant eld theory, which can be eectively obtained from a vector-tensor theory
with topological coupling. we have quantized this nonlocal system rst by using
the bv lagrangian functional formalism, where the propagator could be obtained
without major problems. after that, we have considered its canonical quantization,
where the nonlocalibility becomes a more dicult problem to be circumvented. the
non-localibility manifests itself through the canonical independence, at commutator
level, between the gauge eld and its derivative of order n, in the limit when n goes
to innity. we have shown, however, that a systematic use of the canonical quanti-
zation procedure order by order permitted us to generate the same greens functions
as those obtained from the functional formalism. on the other hand, the fock space
structure seems dicult to be displayed, due to the odd canonical structure gen-
erated by the system. as it would be expected, when the mass parameter goes to
zero, the tensor and vector sector of the theory decouple, and in the eective vector
theory new constraints arise as a consequence of this limit. we have also shown in a
appendix that a careful analysis of these constraints leads to a canonical structure
that is identical to the usual massless gauge theory.

we could argue about the functional hamiltonian quantization, due to batalin,
fradkin and vilkovisky (bfv) [13], of this nonlocal system. the use of this for-
malism here appears to be a nontrivial task. even with the procedure of how to
circumvent the innity number of momenta, we still have an additional problem
because velocities have to be considered as independent canonical coordinates in
higher derivative systems. consequently, it is necessary to distinguish in the hamil-
tonian path integral formalism what is a time derivative of a coordinate and what
is an independent coordinate itself [14]. this problem is presently under study and
possible results shall be reported elsewhere [15].

introducing the results given by expressions (a.2), (a.9) and (a.10) into the initial
expression (a.1), the equation (3.3) is obtained.

appendix b

in this appendix, we calculate the inverse of the matrix (3.16). first we notice it
has the following block structure

s =





(cid:16) 1  1 (cid:17)







4  1


3  1 


1  4

4  4

3  4

(cid:16)






(cid:17)






(cid:16)






1  3

(cid:17)


.

(b.1)





4  3


3  3 


of course, since the inverse s1 has the same block structure, we consider it is
generically given by

s1 = 


a b c k
 f k
d e

gj h 
i k
j
j

.




(b.2)

we then must have

the combination of eqs. (3.16), (b.2) and (b.3) gives us the following set of equa-

these are the elements of the matrix s1 given by (3.17).

appendix c

when we take the limit m  0 in expressions (3.5), we get the following expressions
for the momenta

 =  f0 

1


0 a ,

(1)


= 0 .

(c.1)

the remaining momenta (which are all zero) do not make sense to be considered
because in the limit m  0 the system does not have innite derivatives anymore.
we observe that relations (c.1) are constrains. so, the commutators cannot come
from the p.b. of a and a, that is actually zero, but from the dirac one. let us
calculate the d.b. of a and a . first, we need the p.b. matrix of the constraints.
we denote these constraints by

t1 =  + f0 +

t2 = (1)
 .

1


0  a ,

17

(c.2)

thus

{t 

1 , t 

1 } {t 

1 , t

{t 

2 , t

2 , t 
2 }




(s ) = 

=   0

1

1 0 ! (cid:16) +

1  



00(cid:17) (~x  ~y) .

(c.3)

to calculate the d.b. we need the inverse of the matrix above. this is give by

(s)1 =   0 1

1

0 ! (cid:16) + (  1) 00(cid:17) (~x  ~y) .

now, the d.b. can be directly calculated. the result is

{a(~x, t), a (~y, t)} = (cid:16)

 + (  1) 0

0(cid:17) (~x  ~y) .

(c.4)

(c.5)

the commutator between ai and aj can be directly obtained from the d.b. above
and it is actually non zero when m  0, what makes consistent the procedure we
are developing.

appendix d

considering that

t(cid:16)a (x)a(x)(cid:17) = (t  t) a (x)a(x) + (t  t) a(x)a (x)

(d.1)

and using the commutators given by expression (3.20) we can obtain the following
relations

2

t2 t(cid:16)a(x)a(x)(cid:17) = i  
2 t(cid:16)a (x)a(x)(cid:17) = t(cid:16)2a(x)a(x)(cid:17) ,
