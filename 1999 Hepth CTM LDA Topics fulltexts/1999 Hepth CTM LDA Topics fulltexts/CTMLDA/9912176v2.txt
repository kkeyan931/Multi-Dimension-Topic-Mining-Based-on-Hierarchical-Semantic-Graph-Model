abstract

in the (1  2)2approximation the casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball
is derived using a simple and clear method of the mode summation. the
addition theorem for the bessel functions enables one to present in a closed
form the sum over the angular momentum before the integration over the
imaginary frequencies. the linear in (1  2) contribution into the vacuum
energy is removed by an appropriate subtraction. the role of the contact
terms used in other approaches to this problem is elucidated.

i. introduction

the progress in calculation of the casimir energy is rather slow. in his pioneer paper
[1] in 1948 h. b. g. casimir calculated the vacuum electromagnetic energy for the most
simple boundary conditions, for two parallel perfectly conducting plates placed in vacuum.
dielectric properties of the media separated by plane boundaries do not add new mathemat-
ical diculties [2]. however the rst result on the calculation of the casimir energy for the
non-at boundaries was obtained only in 1968. by computer calculations, lasted 3 years,
t. h. boyer found the casimir energy of a perfectly conducting spherical shell [3]. account
of dielectric and magnetic properties of the media in calculations of the vacuum energy for
nonat interface leads to new principal diculties or, more precisely, to a new structure of
divergencies.

the calculation of the casimir energy in a special case, when both the material media
have the same velocity of light, proves to be, from the mathematical stand point, exactly
the same as for perfectly conducting shells placed in vacuum and having the shape of the
interface between these media [414].

the rst attempt to calculate the casimir energy of a dielectric compact ball has been
undertaken by k. a. milton in 1980 [15]. and only just recently the vacuum electromagnetic
energy of a dilute dielectric ball was found1 [1620]. the light velocity is discontinuous on
the surface of such a ball.
in ref. [21] the analysis of the divergencies, which appear in
calculation of the casimir energy of a dielectric ball, has been carried out by determining
the relevant heat kernel coecients. the role of dispersion in this problem is now under
study also [8,19,2225].

under these circumstances it is of a indubitable interest to develop new methods for
calculating the vacuum energy for non-at boundaries with allowance for the material char-
acteristics of the media. it is this aim that is pursued in the present paper.

practically all the calculations of the casimir energy for the boundaries with spherical
or cylindrical symmetries use the uniform asymptotic expansion for the bessel functions. in
place of this we are employing the addition theorem for these functions that enables one to
accomplish the summation over the values of the angular momentum exactly, i.e., in a closed
form. in addition, the starting point in our calculation is a simple and clear representation
of the vacuum energy as a half sum of the eigenfrequencies of electromagnetic oscillations
connected with a dielectric ball (a global approach). this fact is also important due to the
following consideration. from the mathematical stand point, the most consistent method
for treating the divergencies in calculations of the vacuum energy is the zeta regularization
technique [26].
in
refs. [1820] the casimir energy of a dielectric ball has been calculated by making use of
the greens function method. an essential point there was the account of the so called
contact terms. these terms encounter the expression for the vacuum energy being outside
the logarithm function [16,18,27,28], therefore they do not appear when one proceeds from

in this approach, one proceeds from the sum of the eigenfrequencies.

1it is worth noting that the rst right (but rough and not rigorous) estimation of the casimir
energy of a dilute dielectric ball has been done in the paper [4].

2

the sum of the eigenfrequencies.

it is worth noting that the results of the casimir energy calculation for a dilute dielectric
ball, accomplished in the framework of the quantum eld theory [18,19], coincide with those
obtained by summing up the van der waals interactions between individual molecules inside
the ball [16] and by applying a special perturbation theory, where the dielectric ball is treated
as a perturbation of the electromagnetic eld in unbounded empty space [17].

the layout of the paper is as follows.

in sec. ii the derivation of the integral repre-
sentation for the vacuum energy is given by the mode sum and contour integration. the
subtraction procedure that gives the renormalized casimir energy in the n2-approximation
is discussed in detail as well as its physical justication. the addition theorem for the bessel
functions enables one to carry out the sum over the angular momentum in a closed form. it
leads to an exact (in the n2-approximation) value of the casimir energy of a dilute dielec-
tric ball. in the conclusion (sec. iii) the method proposed here for calculating the casimir
energy is briey discussed, as well as the implications of the obtained results concerning,
specically, the elucidation of the role of the contact terms used in other approaches to
this problem. in the appendix the analysis of the divergencies is accomplished revealing an
important relation between the linear and quadratic in n contributions into the vacuum
energy. it is this relation that provides a simple and eective scheme of calculations which
is followed in this paper.

ii. mode summation for vacuum electromagnetic energy of a

dilute dielectric ball

we shall consider a solid ball of radius a placed in an unbounded uniform medium.
the nonmagnetic materials making up the ball and its surroundings are characterized by
permittivity 1 and 2, respectively. it is assumed that the conductivity in both the media
is zero. the natural system of units is used where c = h = 1.

we shall proceed from the standard denition of the vacuum energy as the sum over the

eigenfrequencies of electromagnetic oscillations [29]

e =

1

2 xs

(s  s) .

(2.1)

here s are the classical frequencies of the electromagnetic eld for the boundary conditions
described above, and the frequencies s correspond to a certain limiting boundary conditions
that will be specied below.

the sum (1/2)ps s in eq. (2.1) plays the same role as the counter terms in the standard

renormalization procedure in quantum eld theory [30]. however in the renormalizable
eld models, considered in unbounded minkowski space-time, the explicit form of these
counter terms is known (at least, it is known the algorithm of their construction at each
order of perturbation theory). unlike this, there are no general rules for obtaining the
terms that should be subtracted when calculating the vacuum energy. therefore, in a new
problem on calculating the casimir energy it is necessary to specify the boundary conditions,
determining the frequencies s, anew, appealing to some physical considerations.

3

in the case of the plane geometry of boundaries or when considering the casimir eect
for distinct bodies it is sucient to subtract in eq. (2.1) the contribution of the minkowski
space [29,21]. in the problem at hand it implies to take the limit a  , i.e., that the
medium 1 tends to ll the entire space. but it turns out that this subtraction is not sucient
because the linear in 12 contribution into the vacuum energy retains. further, we assume
that the dierence 1  2 is small and content ourselves only with the (1  2)2-terms.
the necessity to subtract the contributions into the vacuum energy linear in 1  2 is
justied by the following consideration. the casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball can be
thought of as the net result of the van der waals interactions between the molecules making
up the ball [16]. these interactions are proportional to the dipole momenta of the molecules,
i.e., to the quantity (1  1)2. thus, when a dilute dielectric ball is placed in the vacuum,
then its casimir energy should be proportional to (1  1)2. it is natural to assume that
when such a dielectric ball is surrounded by an innite dielectric medium with permittivity
2, then its casimir energy should be proportional to (1  2)2. the physical content of the
contribution into the vacuum energy linear in 1 2 has been investigated in the framework
of the microscopic model of the dielectric media (see ref. [31] and references therein). it has
been shown that this term represents the self-energy of the electromagnetic eld attached to
the polarizable particles or, in more detail, it is just the sum of the individual atomic lamb
shifts. certainly this term in the vacuum energy should be disregarded when calculating
the casimir energy which is originated in the electromagnetic interaction between dierent
polarizable particles or atoms [17,18,3234].

further, we put for sake of symmetry

1 = n1 = 1 +

n
2

, 2 = n2 = 1 

n
2

.

(2.2)

here n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the ball and of its surroundings, respectively,
and it is assumed that n << 1. from here it follows, in particular, that

1  2 = (n1 + n2)(n1  n2) = 2n .

(2.3)

thus, using the denition (2.1) we shall keep in mind that really two subtractions should
be done: rst the contribution, obtained in the limit a  , has to be subtracted and then
all the terms linear in n should also be removed.
we present the vacuum energy dened by eq. (2.1) in terms of the contour integral in
the complex frequency plane. the details of this procedure can be found in refs. [4,3537].

(2.7)

the prime in eq. (2.6) stands for the dierentiation with respect to the argument of the
riccatibessel functions.

in eq. (2.4) we have introduced cuto k in integration over the frequencies. this regu-
larization is natural in the casimir problem because physically it is clear that the photons
of a very short wave length do not contribute into the vacuum energy since they do not
feel the boundary between the media with dierent permittivities 1 and 2. in the nal
expression the regularization parameter k should be put to tend to innity, the divergencies,
that may appear here, being canceled by appropriate counter terms.

the numerator (denominator) in the logarithm function in eq. (2.4) is responsible for
the rst (second) term in the initial formula (2.1). for brevity we write in eq. (2.4) simply
l(i) instead of lima l(iay). taking into account the asymptotics of the riccati
bessel functions

the term e1 accounts for only the expression exp(2n y) in the argument of the loga-
rithm function in eq. (2.9) and it appears as a result of subtracting the minkowski space
contribution into the casimir energy (the sum with s in eq. (2.1) and the denominator in
eq. (2.4)).

it is worth noting that the term e1 is exactly the casimir energy considered by schwinger
in his attempt to explain the sonoluminescence [39]. really, introducing the cuto k for
frequency integration and the cuto y = /a for the angular momentum summation we
arrive at the result

(2.15)

we have substituted here the summation over l by integration. up to the multiplier (2/3) it
is exactly the schwinger value for the casimir energy of a ball (1 = 1) in water (2  4/3)
[27]. the term linear in n and of the same structure was also derived in refs. [17,32,33].
as it was explained above the energy e1 should be discarded.

in our calculation, we content ourselves with the n2-approximation. hence, in eq.
l (y, y) and keep in expansion of the logarithm function
l and p 2
l

(2.12) one can put p 2
l (n1y, n2y)  p 2
only the terms proportional to n2. in this approximation, the contributions of w 2
into the vacuum energy are additive

eren = eren

w + eren
p .

(2.16)

in the appendix it is shown that for obtaining the n2contribution into the casimir energy
of the function w 2
in the argument of the logarithm in eq. (2.12), it is sucient to calculate
l
the n2contribution of the function w 2
l alone but changing the sign of this contribution
to the opposite one (see eq. (a20)). hence,

(2.18)

usually, when calculating the vacuum energy in the problem with spherical symmetry, the
uniform asymptotic expansion of the bessel functions is used [38]. as a result, an approx-
imate value of the casimir energy can be derived, the accuracy of which depends on the
number of terms preserved in the asymptotic expansion.

6

we shall persist in another way employing the technique of the paper [12]. by making
use of the addition theorem for the bessel functions [38], we rst do the summation over the
angular momentum l in eq. (2.12) and only after that we will integrate over the imaginary
frequency y. as a result, we obtain an exact (in the n2approximation) value of the
casimir energy in the problem involved.

further the following addition theorem for the bessel functions [38] will be used

here dr and d stand for the results of the partial dierentiation of the function d in eq.

(2.22). the last terms in eqs. (2.23) and (2.24) are w 2
0 (y, y), respectively.
as it was stipulated before, in eq. (2.23) we have to keep only the terms proportional to
n2 and in eq. (2.24) we have put n = 0.

the calculation of the contribution ep to the casimir energy is straightforward. upon
dierentiation of the right-hand side of eq. (2.24) with respect to y, the integration over dr

we have put here y0 =  without getting the divergencies. as it is explained in the

that this term is nite. it is an essential advantage of our approach. the rest of the terms
in this equation are irrelevant to our consideration. thus the counter term for ew vanishes

(2.31)

2this divergence has the same origin as those arising in summation over l when the uniform
asymptotic expansions of the bessel functions are used [18,19]. the technique employed here is
close to the multiple scattering expansion [40], where these divergencies are also subtracted.

8

at the rst time, this value for the casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball has been
derived in ref. [16] by summing up the van der waals interactions between individual
molecules making up the ball (2 = 1). the result (2.31) was obtained also by treating a
dilute dielectric ball as a perturbation in the complete hamiltonian of the electromagnetic
eld for relevant conguration [17]. in papers [18,19], the value close to the exact one (2.31)
has been obtained by employing the uniform asymptotic expansion of the bessel functions.
in ref. [4] the estimation of the casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball has been done
taking into account, as it is clear now, only the second term in eq. (2.30). and nevertheless
it was not so bad having the accuracy about 35%.

iii. conclusion

in this paper the exact (in the n2approximation) value of the casimir energy of a
dilute dielectric ball is derived in the framework of the quantum eld theory. the starting
point is the mode summation by making use of the contour integration in the complex
frequency plane. unlike the other approaches to this problem, we do not use the uniform
asymptotic expansion of the bessel functions.

the key point in our consideration is employment of the addition theorem for the bessel
functions which enables us to do the summation over the angular momentum values in a
closed form. as a by-product, it is shown that the role of the contact terms, at least in the
n2approximation, consists only in removing the linear in n contributions to the casimir
energy. they do not contribute to the nite value of this energy.

the terms quadratic in n in eq. (a10) exactly reproduce the function fl(y) in eq. (9) of

the problem under consideration. unlike the papers [1820] we didnt introduce the contact
terms in the denition of the casimir energy and nevertheless we have reproduced the key
function fl(y). it implies that the contact terms do not give a contribution into the nite
part of the casimir energy in the problem under consideration. they merely cancel the
terms aln in eq. (a10).

now we show, without invoking the contact terms, that the al terms in eq. (a10) do

not contribute into the vacuum energy.

taking into account the explicit form of the coecients al dened in eq. (a8) one can write

(a12)

when r =  = 1 the derivatives of the function d in eq. (a12) tend to innity. therefore
a preliminary regularization should be introduced here in order to put our consideration on
a rigorous mathematical footing. to this end we dene the right-hand side of eq. (a12) in
the following way

n

(2l + 1)al = n lim

(a13)



xl=1

0(cid:16)drr  2dr + d(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r=1+/2

=1/2

where the positive constant  is a regularization parameter. from the explicit form of the
function d(r, , y) (see eq. (a11)) it follows immediately

the analogous limit for the dierences

lim

0(cid:16)drr  d(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r=1+/2

=1/2

also vanishes. hence in the regularization introduced above the sum under consideration
has the following value

n



xl=1

(2l + 1)al = 1 .

(a16)

it implies immediately that the term linear in n, which encounters eq. (a10) does not
contribute into the vacuum energy e2 dened in eq. (2.12).

now we show that the contributions into the casimir energy given by pl bl and by

in other words, y2l(l, y) in eq. (a9) does not give any nite

in view of all this, we are left with the following scheme for calculating the casimir energy
in the n2approximation in the problem under consideration. first, the n2contribution

one, we obtain the contribution generated by w 2
