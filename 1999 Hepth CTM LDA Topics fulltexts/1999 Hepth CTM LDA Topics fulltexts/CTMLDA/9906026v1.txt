abstract

a broad class of contour gauges is shown to be determined by
admissible contractions of the geometrical region considered and a
suitable equivalence class of curves is dened. in the special case of
magnetostatics, the relevant electromagnetic potentials are directly
related to the ponderomotive forces. schwingers method of extract-
ing a gauge invariant factor from the fermion propagator could, it is
argued, lead to incorrect results. dirac brackets of both maxwell and
yang-mills theories are given for arbitrary admissible space-like paths.
it is shown how to dene a non-abelian ux and local charges which
obey a local charge algebra. fields associated with the charges dier
from the electric elds of the theory by singular topological terms; to
avoid this obstruction to the gauss law it is necessary to exclude a
single, gauge xing curve from the region considered.

1 introduction

the fock-schwinger gauge [1, 2]

a  x = 0

has two remarkable features.
firstly, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the elds [3]:

where

af s



(x) =z 1

0

g(xt)x tdt

g = f + ig[a, a]

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

equation (1.2) is true both in maxwell and yang-mills theories provided that
the bianchi identities are satised.
secondly, the integral along the straight line segment s(x, 0) running from 0
to x.

(1.4)

(1.5)

(1.6)

s(x,0)[af s] =zs(x,0)

af s



(y)dy

is constant i.e. independent of x

therefore

ds(x,0) =

s
x dx = 0

s(x,0) = s(0,0)  0

eqn.(1.5) can be also derived from (1.4) by direct calculation with the bianchi
identities taken into account and will be used by us in a more general context
throughout this paper.
equation (1.5) has an interesting physical interpretation. take electrody-
namics and the null loop s(x, 0)s(x, 0) i.e.
the path followed along the
straight segment (0, x) and back. the ux (sxsx) = 0 for any regular
eld f. next consider the deformed loop consisting of s(x + x, 0)s(x, x +
x)s(x, 0). the change of ux is gauge invariant and reads as:

 = s(x+x,0)[a]  s(x,0)[a] + s(x,x+x)[a]

(1.7)

now s(0,x) does not depend on x for a = af s, so

 = s(x,x+x)[af s]

(1.8)

2

taking x  0 we get the innitesmal change of the ux:

 = af s



(x)x

(1.9)



therefore, af s
(x) can be interpreted as a generalization of the magneto-
static ponderomotive eld. indeed, consider a closed circuit (current inten-
sity i) which contains straight segment s(~x, 0). deformation of s(~x, 0) 
s(~x + ~x, 0)s(~x, ~x + ~x) changes the magnetic interaction energy by i
i.e. the ponderomotive force is iaf s
(~x) in this three-dimensional example.

i

the fock-schwinger gauge is a special case of contour gauges [4], which
in our paper will be specied by condition (1.5) with s(x, 0) replaced by
more general family of curves c(x, x0). let us notice that for any choice
of c(x, x0) the corresponding potential f c is again the ponderomotive eld
corresponding to the deformation c(x, x0)c(x, x0)  c(x + x, x0)s(x, x +
x)c(x, x0). therefore it seems natural to name these path dependent gauges
as ponderomotive ones. the ponderomotive interpretation nicely ts the
fact that the contour gauges are a part of larger family of physical gauges;
in electrodynamics a representant ad of physical gauge we characterise by
choice of the projection operator d p

d p 

  d p 

 = d p 



satisfying

d p 

  () = 0

for the arbitrary scalar function (x).
then

a(d)

  d p 

 a

in particular

a(d)

  d p 

 a(d)



(1.10)

(1.11)

(1.12)

(1.13)

it follows from eqns.(1.10-1.12) that a(d) is gauge invariant quantity with
respect to transformation of the gauge eld a(x), but, on the other hand
the eqn. (1.13) is a gauge condition for the choice of a(d). a vast choice
of dierent gauge invariant formalisms [5] has evidently its source in the
freedom of dening projection operators satisfying eqn.(1.11).

3

in this paper we shall present results concerning contour gauges, character-
ized by a broad class of curves c(x, x0); the corresponding projection operator
p c(x,x0) acts on the 4-potentials as follows

[ p c  a](x) = a(x) 



x zy c(x,x0)

dy a(y )

(1.14)

and as a result of eqn.(1.13) the chosen potential f c(x,x0) has to satisfy
eqn.(1.5) (with s(x, 0) replaced by c(x, x0)). in chapter 2 we show that for
quite general class of curves (including non-smooth ones) our gauge condi-
tion determines f c[f ] in the case of electrodynamics. in the same chapter a
connection between possible contractions of the space-time region considered
and the freedom of choice of our ponderomotive potentials is exhibited and a
suitable equivalence class of curves is dened. a subclass of curves - suitable
for yang-mills theory - is specied and applied in ch.3. some gauges which
have been considered in this theory, such as fock-schwinger [3], superaxial
[6], temporal with space-like fock-schwinger [7] are shown to belong to our
class of gauges.

we generalize - in ch.5 - schwingers method [2] of extracting a eld de-
pendent factor from the fermion propagator for a dirac particle interacting
with a given electromagnetic eld. this enables us to provide an expansion
for the fermion propagator in terms of the electromagnetic elds themselves.
the consistency of the ponderomotive gauge constraints with the canonical
formalism is exhibited in the maxwell theory in ch.6. the dirac brackets
can be obtained in a straightforward way due to the fact that our gauge
constraint at xed time is canonically conjugate to the gauss law constraint.

the application of canonical formalism to yang-mills theories is discussed
in chapters 7 - 9. the dirac brackets are given in ch.7. flux operator
algebras and local charge algebras with structure constants of underlying
yang-mills theory are derived in chapters 8, 9. fields associated with these
charges dier from the electric elds of the theory by singular topological
terms; to avoid this obstruction to the gauss law it is necessary to exclude
a single gauge xing curve from the region considered in the theory.

2 ponderomotive gauges - electrodynamics

let us consider an arbitrary electromagnetic eld

f(x) = a  a

(2.1)

which is continuously once dierentiable at any x  v4, v4 being some open,
simply connected space-time region. next, let us associate with every pair
(x1, x2) a unique continuous path running from x2  v4 to x1  v4 and
contained in v4:

the parametric representation of c is taken to be:

(x1, x2)  c(x1, x2)  v4

x  c(x1, x2)  x = c(x1, x2,  )  v4

for some   [0, 1] with

x
2 = c(x1, x2, 0)
x
1 = c(x1, x2, 1)

our results will not depend on the equivalent reparametrizations:

with

  t( )

t


> 0,

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

in what follows we shall x x2 = x0 and demand that c(x, x0,  ) satisfy the
following regularity conditions:

i) c is c (2) - regular as a function of x,  everywhere in v4  [0, 1] with

the possible exception of  = 1, . . . n; i(x) being c (2)-regular.

ii) at   i, at xed x, the left - and right - side nite limits exist for

n  2 derivatives. these limits coincide for:

c(x, x0,  )| i(x) = c(x, x0, i(x))

c(x, x0,  )

c(x, x0,  )  1 x + o(1   )g

1 (x)

c(x, x0,  )  0 x

0 + o( )g

2 (x)

(2.9)

(2.10)

the somewhat general condition ii) is of importance; it admits functions with
discontinuously changing direction.

we shall now prove the following theorem:

theorem 1 given the electromagnetic eld f, the condition

with

dc(x,x0) = 0

c(x,x0) =zc(x,x0)

a(y)dy

uniquely determines the electromagnetic potential a as

a = f c

(2.21)

and from d = 0 eqn.(2.13) follows. moreover, it can be directly checked
that

f c
,(x)  f c

,(x) = f(x)

(2.22)

for f c given by eqn.(2.13) provided that f is antisymmetric and satises the
bianchi identities and that c has to satisfy the regularity conditions i), ii), iii).

it seems rewarding that our gauge condition (2.11) leads to the expression
(2.13) for a, identical with a known illustration of the poincare lemma
[8, 9]. in this context it is worth noticing that the converse of theorem 1 is
true and follows from eqn.(2.21) i.e. if we choose a in eq.(2.21) as f c given
by eqn.(2.13), then dc[f c] = 0 i.e. eqn.(2.11) is satised.
let us remark that we tacitly demand that v4 be contractible [9] to the point
x0  v4 with the admissible deformations (homotopy)  dened through the
conditions i), ii), iii) (of course c () - class homotopy satises our conditions,
too). therefore, both a set d of points x2 to which v4 is  - contractible
and sets of admissible curve families c(x, x2 = const,  ) for each x2  d
are determined by v4 itself. let us label the relevant collection of all such

7

c(x, x2  d) by (d).
to any c   there corresponds a unique electromagnetic potential a = f c
satisfying eqn.(2.11). let us check when dierent curves may correspond to
the same f . take two dierent curve families c1(x, x01), c2(x, x02) and assume

f c1 = f c2

i.e. dc1[f c1] = dc2[f c1] = 0

(2.23)

(2.24)

first, notice that

where

dc[a] = 0  c(x,x0) = c(x0,x0) = c[f ]

(2.25)

c[f ] =ic(x0,x0)

adc

(2.26)

where c[f ] does not depend on x and c[f ] 6= 0 unless c(x, x0) is contractible
to a tree [10] i.e. to a closed path (e.g. a point) with null area.
next, from (2.24) and (2.25) it follows that

zc1(x,x01)c2(x,x02)
il

for any x and therefore,

for any x, x  v4 ;

f c1(y)dy = c1[f ]  c2[f ]

(2.27)

f c1(y)dy = 0

(2.28)

l = c1(x, x01)c2(x, x02)c2(x, x02)c1(x, x01)

(2.29)

as eqn.(2.28) has to be true for any chosen electromagnetic, c (1)- regular
eld f , l has to be a tree in order to satisfy (2.28). therefore we should
consider a set of classes (d)/t with equivalence relation t :

c1(x, x01) = c2(x, x02)

(2.30)

if, for any x, x  v4 the closed path l(c1c2c,
tree [10].

2c,

1) (eqn. 2.29) is a

8

(it can be checked that relation (2.30) is an equivalence relation) choosing
a single representative for each class c/t we get a one to one correspondence
c  f c. the permutation of a set (d)/t

implies

p : c  p (c)

f c  p f c = fp (c)

(2.31)

(2.32)

which, after the use of eqn.(2.13) and (2.21) (inserting a = f c)reads

f c(x)dx  f p (c)(x)dx = f c(x)dx  dp (c)[f c]

(2.33)

from eqns.(2.13),(2.21), we easily nd that

dc1[f c2] + dc2[f c1] = 0

so that (2.33) becomes

f c(x)dx = f p (c)(x)dx  dc[f p (c)]

finally, comparing (2.33) with a familiar form

we get

i.e.

f p (c)dx = f cdx 

dp (c)[fc] =

i

i

cp (c) = 0 exp(iep (c)[fc])

(2.34)

(2.35)

(2.36)

(2.37)

(2.38)

let us add, that the transition a  f c can be obtained similarly for an
arbitrary potential a:

f c = a 

i
e

1(a  f c)(a  f c)

with

(a  f c) = 0 exp(iec[a])

so that any a can be gauge transformed to f c.

3 yang-mills theory

the generalization of the above results to yang-mills elds is relatively
straightforward except for one complication linked to the bianchi identity.
in the yang-mills theories the eld g is dened as

where

and

g = f + ig[a, a]

f = a  a

a = aa

ta

from (3.1), (3.2) the bianchi identities follow:

dg + dg + dg = 0

where

the condition (2.11) applied to the matrix a:

d =  + ig[a, ]

for a curve with

dc(x,x0)[a] = 0

c(x0, x0) = x0

leads - due to eqns. (2.25),(2.26) - to

therefore, trivially

c(x,x0) = 0

 = d = 0

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

theorem 1 can be applied to a with a given f and, using (2.13) with (3.1)
we get

f c

 =zc(cid:16)g(c)  ig[f c

 , f c

](cid:17) c

(3.10)

in order to simplify (3.10) let us limit ourselves to a class of curve families
satisfying as explained below a self-contractibility condition:

10

for any y  c(x, x0),

c(x, x0)  c(y, x0) = c(y, x0)

(3.11)

this condition means that the curves dened by:

y  c(c(x, x0, t), x0)  y = c(x, x0, 1)

(3.12)

for some 0  1  t
and

y  c(c(x, x0, t), x0)  y = c(c(x, x0, t), x0,  )

(3.13)

for some 0    1
are the same for any 0  t  1. therefore, there must exist a change of
parametrization

  h(, x, t),

h


> 0

h(1, x, t) = t
h(0, x, t) = 0

(3.14)

leading to the following relation

c(c(x, x0, t), x0,  ) = c(x, x0, h(, x, t))

(3.15)

we are now in a position to prove the following theorem:

theorem 2 for any self-contractible family of curves, c, eqn.(3.1) together
with the condition (3.6) are equivalent to:

a = f c

(x) zc(x,x0)

g(y)

y
x dy

(3.16)

provided that f c[g], g satisfy the bianchi identities (3.4).

proof
firstly let us prove that (3.16) follows from (3.1), (3.6). this will be achieved
by the proof of the following lemma.

es eqns.(3.1), (3.6) if (3.4) is fullled.

this is solvable, and for c,(x, x0, 1)  x gives (3.26). moreover (3.26) re-
mains true for any a  f c, transition, showing that any a can be gauge
transformed into f c.

4 relation to other yang-mills gauges

we show now that those gauge conditions utilized [3, 6, 7] in yang-mills
theory which lead to the form a = a[g]; are special case of our pondero-
motive gauges coresponding to special cases of the curves c.
if we take
c(0, x) = s(0, x), evidently satisfying condition (3.11) we get from (3.18)

ax = 0

(4.1)

i.e. the fock-schwinger gauge [3].
for c(0, x) = s(0, [0, ~x])s([0, ~x], [x0, ~x], where [a,~b] denote a space-time point,
we get temporal and space-like fock-schwinger [7] gauges:

~a(0, ~x)  ~x = 0
a0(x0, ~x) = 0

13

(4.2)

finally, choosing

c(0, x) = s(0, [x0,~0])s([x0,~0], [x0, x1, 0, 0])s([x0, x1, 0, 0], [x0, x1, x2, 0])

s([x0, x1, x2, 0], [x0, x1, x2, x3]) (4.3)

we get the superaxial gauge (see e.g.[6]):

a0(x0,~0) = 0 a2(x0, x1, x2, 0) = 0
a1(x0, x1, 0, 0) = 0 a3(x) = 0

(4.4)

5 path dependent greens functions

now we consider a dirac particle interacting with a given electromagnetic
eld. use of our ponderomotive gauges enables us to generalize schwingers
method of extracting a gauge invariant factor from the fermion propagator
and leads to a perturbative expansion for the propagator in terms of the elec-
tromagnetic eld itself. we show that schwingers approach to this problem
could lead to incorrect results.
starting with the dirac equation

(/ + iea/ + im)(a | x) = 0

we substitute, for some family c(x, x0):

(f c | x) = (a  f c)(a | x)

where (compare eqn.(2.40); we put 0 = 1):

(a  f c) = exp(iec[a])

then, using (2.39) we get

(/ + ief/ c + im)(f/ c | x) = 0

similarly, the green function

g(a | x1, x2) = i < 0 | t ((a | x1) (a | x2)) | 0 >

satisfying

(/ 1 + iea/ + im)g(a | x1, x2) = i(x1  x2)

14

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

g(a | x1, x2)(


/ 2 +iea/ (x2) + im) = i(x2  x1)

(5.7)

can be replaced by

g(f c | x1, x2) = (a  f c(x1,x0))ga1(a  f c(x2,x0))

(5.8)

and eqns.(5.6), (5.7) are replaced by

(/ 1 + ief/ c(x1) + im)g(f c | x1, x2) = i(x1  x2)

g(f c | x1, x2)(



/ 2 +ief/ c(x2) + im) = i(x1  x2)

(5.9)

(5.10)

they have the same iterative solution as (5.6), (5.7):

g(f c | x1, x2) = s + esf/ cs + e2sf/ csf/ cs + . . .

(5.11)

where

s(x, y) =z

d4p
(2)4

p/ + m

p2  m2 + i

eip(xy)

(5.12)

the above suggests that an approach used by schwinger [2] may not be
generally applicable. schwinger uses a dierent transformation from ours
(5.8) namely:

eg(x1, x2) = (a  f c(x1,x2))g(a | x1, x2)

(5.13)

although the denitions (5.8) and (5.13) dier only by a (known) phase fac-
tor, the dierence could become important in calculations involving deriva-
tives of the greens function. while in eqns.(5.9), (5.10) involving
g(fc | x1, x2) only one function

f c,l
(x,x0)  f c(x, x0)

(5.14)

occurs in both equations, the equations for eg will involve two functions, f c,l

and f c,r:

(/ 1 + ief/ c,l(x1, x2) + im)eg(x1, x2) = i(x1  x2)

/ 2 +ief/ c,r(x1, x2) + im) = i(x1  x2)

6 ponderomotive gauges in the canonical for-

malism - maxwell theory

we consider now the use of our ponderomotive gauges in the quantized eld
theoretic context i.e. in qed. we shall show that our gauge constraint and
gausss law are canonically conjugate leading to a rather simple form for the
dirac brackets of the theory. the canonical hamiltonian in maxwell theory

hc =z d3x(cid:20) 1

~b2 + a0 ~  ~(cid:21)

with the primary constraints:

d1 = 0 = 0

 d2 = ii = 0

16

(6.1)

(6.2)

(6.3)

requires two futher constraints before the construction of the dirac brackets
[11]
let us choose them to be a temporal gauge condition

and ponderomotive space-like gauge condition

d3 = a0 = 0

d4 =z 1

at a given moment of time. the curve c runs from ~c(~x, 0) = ~x0 to ~c(~x, 1) = ~x

where

the poisson brackets between the dj turn out to be:

c31 = c13  [d3(~x), d1(~y)]p = 3(~x  ~y)

(6.8)

c42(x, y) = c24(y, x)  [d4(~x), d2(~y)]p = 3(~y  ~x)  3(~y  ~x0)

(6.9)

the rest of poisson brackets vanish. as an example let us derive eqn.(6.9).
we have

c42 = [d4(x), d2(y)]p = 

hence

= 3(~y  ~c(~x, 1))  3(~y  ~c(~x, 0))

(6.11)

if now we discard the single point ~x = ~y = ~x0 the cik can be written as

cik =" 0 i

0 #  3(~x  ~y)

i

17

so that

c1
ik = cik

(6.12)

the simplicity of the cik stems from the choice of the ponderomotive gauge
condition d4; moreover, and this is very important, d4 and d2 (gausss law)
are canonically conjugate.
the dirac brackets of the theory,

[a, b]d = [a, b]p  [a, di]p c1

ik [dk, b]p

(6.13)

become in our case

[a, b]d = [a, b]p + [a, d3]p  [d1, b]p 
[a, d1]p  [d3, b]p +
+[a, d4]p  [d2, b]p  [a, d2]p  [d4, b]p

for ~, ~a the poisson brackets with dis are:

[ai(~x), d2(~z)]p =


xi 3(~x  ~z)

[i(~x), d4(~z)]p = z 1

0

and the other brackets vanish.
so, nally, for

3(~x  ~c(~z,  ))

~x 6= ~x0
~y 6= ~y0

[i(x), aj(y)]d = ij(~x  ~y) + [i, d4]p  [d2, aj]p

= ij(~x  ~y) +z d3zz d 3(~x  ~c(~z,  ))

ci


j3(~y  ~z)

= ij(~x  ~y) +



yj z d 3(~x  ~c(~y,  ))

the other dirac brackets vanish. 0 and a0 being constraints, have vanishing
diracs brackets with any variable.

7 dirac brackets for y-m theory

in the case of yang-mills theory we limit ourselves to self-contractible fam-
ilies, dened by eqn.(3.11). they have a useful property established earlier
(compare lemma in the proof of theorem 2), namely y-m potentials are
orthogonal to these curves, i.e. from the gauge constraints

follows eqn.(3.18)

zc(x,x0)

a

a(y)dy = 0

c(x, x0,  )



a

a(c(x, x0,  )) = 0

(7.1)

(7.2)

for any 0    1 and x  v . this relation will allow us to establish eq.(7.14)
which in turn is a crucial condition responsible for the simple form of dirac
brackets.
we are going to implement these gauges into canonical formalism of y-m
theory.
in what follows the discussion of surface terms will be omitted. the canonical
hamiltonian is then:

h =zv

(7.5)

our further considerations will be valid for the region v:

v = v  p (~x0)

(7.10)

(7.11)

(7.12)

next, let us remark that compatibility of (7.9) with (7.10) is evident once we
prove - in analogy with maxwell theory - that in v

[d(4)

d (~x), d(2)

a (~y)]p = (~x  ~y)ad

(7.13)

a (y), ~  ~ea (comp. eq.(7.7))yields already r.h.s. of
the rst term of d(2)
(7.13) - derivation is the same as for maxwell theory. so we have to show
that

cabc[d(4)

a (~x), ai

(7.14)

the use of (7.9) gives

(7.15)

please notice, that dzkak(z)|zc(~x,~x0)  0 from (7.9) (comp.eqns (7.1), (7.2)),
therefore (7.14) is proved.
let us come back to constraints ((7.6)-(7.9)). with the help of (7.13)the
matrix

8 flux algebras

in this chapter we are going to establish algebras of uxes:

e ()

bk

a nkd
~x0 / 

(8.1)

(8.2)

the surfaces ,  are not interrelated. in the rst part of this chapter we
shall choose these surfaces in such a manner that the uxes b, e will be equal
to loop integrals over the potential and dual potential, respectively.
let us consider at the beginning a special type of surfaces appearing in
denitions (8.1), (8.2) of b, e uxes. take a loop l and some homotopy
c(~x,~a). we dene a horn h(l, c):

~x  h(l, c)  xk = ck(~l(t),~a, t1)

(8.3)

21

for some t, t1  [0, 1] and x orientation on this surface:

~n||  ~c

t1

~c

t!



(8.4)

we are going to show that uxes b, e through these homotopy horns are
equal to loop integrals:

with

a dxr

(8.5)

(8.6)

(8.7)

(8.8)

l, l and c, c need not be related. at this stage we need not specify in
what gauge ~ba, ~ea are given. eqns.(8.5), (8.6) are consequence of a simple
observation. take any antisymmetric tensor tij and dene

then

where

gr(x) =zyc(~x,~a)
gr(x)dxr =z dtdt1

(8.11)

(8.12)

(8.13)

replacement g  f orf and t k  bkorek, gives eqns.(8.5) and (8.6),
respectively.
if we specify ~ba, ~ea to be in a gauge dened through c from eqn.(8.7), then

22

f r
a (x) is a potential in this gauge. still there is a vast choice of homotopies c
dening dual potential , f . let us consider dirac brackets of e, b in c-gauge:

f r

[bd, ec]d =(cid:20)zl
d dxr,zl

dyszc(y,a)

d dxr,zl
dzi zj

c dys(cid:21)d

using (7.19) one gets, after some algebra, the following expression:

, bh

d id

c

he h 
+gccdgzxl

= cdn(l; h ) +

dxrf r

g (x)n(c(x, a); h )

where

n(l; h ) =xt
n(c(~x, a); h ) = x (x)

t1

~l(t1)

sgn
sgn ~c(~x,~a, 1)

 ~nh (t2, t3)
 ~nh (2, 3)!

with ti, i(x) being the solutions of the following equations:

~c(l(t2),~a, t3) = ~l(t1)

~c(l(2),~a, 3) = ~c(~x,~a, 1)

(8.14)

(8.15)

(8.16)

(8.17)

(8.18)

(8.19)

and ~nh  being normal to a horn h   h(l, c) (comp.eqns (8.3), (8.4)).
the conditions (8.18) or (8.19) are fullled whenever the surface of h  is
pierced by loop l or homotopy curve c(~x,~a), respectively. ns in eqns (8.16),
(8.17) denote net numbers of piercings.
the abelian part of (8.15) has been already discussed [7] for the radial gauge;
for abelian theories it leads to thooft algebra [12]. the non-abelian part can
be expressed through surface integrals. call kn part of a loop l, character-
ized by n(c; h ) = n, n xed (kn can consist of disjoint pieces). we have

(8.20)

l =pn kn and corresponding horn surface:

h(l, c) =[n

h(kn , c)

23

where

x  h(kn , c)  ~x = ~c(~y,~a, t)

(8.21)

for some y  kn and t  [0, 1]. evidently eqn(8.5) holds for h(kn , c) so
that eqn(8.15) can be rewritten as:

[e h 

c

, bh

+gccdgxn

d ] = cdn(l; h ) +
~bg  ~nd

nzh(kn ,c)

(8.22)

let us add, that in fact eqn(8.22) holds for any surface s, not necessarily a
horn h (l, c). h  is useful if we want to keep relation with loop integrals
over dual potential (see eqns (8.6), (8.8)). more generally, we have:

[e s

c , bh

d ] = cdn(l; s) + gccdfxn

nzh(kn ,c)

~bf  ~nd

(8.23)

let us consider now uxes e (s1)
si(t1, t2):

c

, e (s2)

c

. surfaces si are parametrized by given

x  si  ~x = ~si(t1, t2)

(8.24)

for some (t1, t2)  [0, 1].

the dirac bracket of e (s1)

c

, e (s2)

d

- calculated in c-gauge - is given by the

following expression:

] =
~ef (s1)~ns1(s1)n(c(~s1,~a); s2)d +

[e (s1)

, e (s2)

d

c

gccdf(cid:20)zs1s1
+zs2s2

~ef (s2)~ns2(s2)n(c(~s2,~a); s1)d(cid:21)

where ns are the net numbers of piercings:

n(c(~s1,~a); s2) = xti(s1)

sgn ~c(~s1,~a, t3)

t3

 ~ns2(t1, t2)!

with ti(s1) being solutions of the following equation:

(8.25)

(8.26)

~c(~s1,~a, t3) = ~s2(t1, t2)

(8.27)

24

eqn (8.27) is fullled whenever, for a given s1  s1 the homotopy curve
c(~s1,~a) crosses the surface s2. changing s1  s2, s1  s2 in eqns (8.26),
(8.27) one gets n from the second integral on the r.h.s. of eqn(8.25). in what
follows we shall limit ourselves to surfaces being tangent at most along a curve
to any convolution of homotopy curves c(~x,~a) considered in a given gauge.
this in turn means that the net number of piercings given by eqn.(8.26) is
undened at most along a curve so that surface integrals in eqn.(8.25) may
have a meaning. making in (8.25) transition s2  s1 we get for s1 = s2 = s:

[e (s)

c

, e (s)

d

]d = 2gccdfzss

~ef (s)  ~ns(s)n(c(s, a); s)d

(8.28)

in this case there is always at least one common point of c(~s,~a) and s, as
c(~s,~a) ends on s  s. the weight of this end- point contribution to n is 1
2
as can be seen from the limiting transition s1  s2 in eqn(8.25). therefore,
for any xed s  s:

2n(c(s, a); s) = sgn

|t3=1  ~ns(~s) +

~c(~s,~a, t3)

t3

+2 xt;t36=1,s6=s(t1,t2)

sgn c(~s,~a, t3)

t3

 ~ns(t1, t2)!

with

eqns (8.23), (8.28) together with the trivial bracket

~c(~s,~a, t3) = ~s(t1, t2)

[bc, bd]d = 0

(8.29)

(8.30)

(8.31)

do not form closed algebra for any chosen h(l, c) and s. they can be
however replaced by a set of closed algebras on the properly chosen parts
of h(l, c) and s. this will not be discussed here. let us conclude with a
choice of such h(l0, c) and s0 that

(8.32)

i.e. abelian part does not contribute to (8.23). moreover, put 2n in eqn(8.28)
and n in eqn(8.23) equal to 1. (example: in the fock-schwinger gauge take

l0[ s0 = 

25

h(l0, c) to be a cone and s0 to be any planar surface containing elliptic
section of h0). in such a case we have:

[e s0

a , bh0

b

]d = gcabcbh0

c

[e s0

c

a , e s0
[bh0

b ]d = gcabce s0
a , bh0

]d = 0

b

(8.33)

(8.34)

(8.35)

if we took s0 to be closed surface surrounding ~a, then (8.34) still holds and
is the algebra of charges contained in its interior, v0. the question whether
the algebra holds for any closed surface will be discussed in the next chapter.

9 local charge algebras

it seems interesting to investigate whether colour electric ux algebra from
(8.34) can be extended to the general case of two arbitrary closed surfaces;
if it were so, then we might be able to establish local colour charge algebras
smilar to well known avour current algebras of the traditional quark model.
let us take closed surfaces si  v (v = v  p (~a), comp. eqn.(7.12))
which are boundaries of 3-dimensional, open regions vi  v . next, denoting
an outward ux of ~ea through si as ea(vi), we shall check commutation
relations of colour electric uxes

ea(vi) =def e si
a

(9.1)

for two situations: a)v1 = v2, b) v1  v2 = .
for the case a) we get from eqns.(8.28-8.30)

a) v1 = v2

if p (~a)  v1,

if p (~a) 6 v1,

[ea(v1), eb(v1)]d = gcabcec(v1)
[ea(v1), eb(v1)]d = gcabcec(v1)

(9.2)
(9.3)

for the case b) we get from eqns.(8.25-8.27)

b) v1  v2 = 

26

if p (~a)  v1, p (~a) 6 v2,

[ea(v1), eb(v2)]d = gcabcec(v2)
[ea(v1), eb(v2)]d = 0

if p (~a) 6 v1v2,

(9.4)
(9.5)

if we assumed that ~e is regular at ~r = ~a, then eqn.(9.4) would mean that
the electric charges dened by (9.1) do not form local algebra. however,
such an assumption is not sound; eqns.(9.2-9.5) exhibit essential role of the
point p (~a) despite the fact that p (~a) 6 si in our derivations. having this in
mind let us consider a sequence {v k
0 } of open balls containing ~a. let their
boundaries sk
0 have radii k  0 for k   (please notice that k = 0 is
never reached as sk

0  v). let us dene

and assume existence of limit

ec = lim
k

c

for any xed surface s eqns.(8.25-8.27) lead to the following relation

[ea, e s

b ]d =def

and, as a consequence,

[ek

a, e s

b ]d = gcabce s

b

[ea, eb(vi)]d = gcabcec(vi)

moreover,

now we are in a position to introduce charges associated with the new eld

where

qt

g(v1) = 1 if ~a  v1
g(v1) = 0 if ~a 6 v1

using eqns.(9.1-9.16) one can check that qt

a (vi) satisfy local algebra

[qt

a (v1), qt

b (v1)]d = gcabcqt

c (v1)

for any xed open v1  v

and

[qt

a (v1), qt

b (v2)]d = 0

(9.15)

(9.16)

(9.17)

(9.18)

for v1  v2 = 0

eqns.(9.2), (9.3) together with eqns.(9.14-9.18) clearly demonstrate existence
of a point term at ~r = ~a. this leads to non-integrable singularity in hamil-
tonian, unless ea = 0. in quantum theory it would mean that we choose such
a subspace of states, h, that

ea| >= 0

for any | > h and for any a.
then eqns.(9.11),(9.12) lead to

ei

a(~x)| >= ai

a(~x)| >= 0

(9.19)

(9.20)

for any ~x  v and any | > h, i.e.
theory is trivial unless ea 6= 0.
therefore in order to avoid obstruction to the gauss law we have to exclude
a curve from the region v and to deal with the region vc0

vc0 = v  {c( ~r0  s,~a)}

(9.21)

where c0 = c( ~r0  s,~a) is any curve joining ~a with some chosen point ~r0
at the boundary s of the region v . the curve c0 should belong to a family
of curves used for gauge xing so that nonabelian parts of dirac brackets
(eqns.(7.19),(7.21)) would not mix dynamical variables on c0 with those on

28

vc0. the choice of vc0 makes the use of ea unnecessary as closed surfaces
around ~a cannot be contained in vc0. now, whether curve c0 will be a
regular or singular line of eld e can be in principle derived from dynamics
of the theory in the region vc0.

so that

then from (a.3)

i  i = [f c

, f c
]

g = f + ig[f c

, f c
]

(a.7)

(a.8)

i.e. eqn.(3.1) as desired. eqn.(3.6) trivially follows from (3.16); it is enough
to repleace t by g in (3.17) and use the result (3.18) of the lemma.
