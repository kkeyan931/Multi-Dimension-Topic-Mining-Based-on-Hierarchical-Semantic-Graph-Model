abstract: the interaction between static d0-branes at nite temperature is considered
in the matrix theory and the superstring theory. the results agree in both cases to
the leading order in the supersymmetry violation by temperature, where the one-loop
approximation is reliable. the eective static potential is short-ranged and attractive.

introduction

the matrix theory [2] is the large-n limit of the 10-dimensional supersymmetric yang
mills theory dimensionally reduced to 0 spatial dimensions. when the coupling constant
g2
ym is large, the matrix theory describes 11-dimensional m-theory while the limit of
small g2
ym is associated with 10-dimensional iia superstring. the matrix theory correctly
reproduces properties of d-branes in the superstring theory including their interactions to
the leading order in violation of supersymmetry, e.g. at small velocities or large separations
between d-branes or weak magnetic elds living on d-branes.

in this talk i consider the formulation of the matrix theory at nite temperature given
by an euclidean path integral with boundary conditions along the compactied time
which are periodic for the yangmills elds and antiperiodic for fermionic superpartners.
i present the result of the computation of the eective potential between static d0-branes
in the one-loop approximation and show that it agrees with an analogous computation in
superstring theory, where an integration is to be performed over the non-trivial holonomies
of the temporal components of abelian gauge elds living on the d0-branes. this agree-
ment is to the leading order in the supersymmetry violation by temperature, where the
one-loop approximation is reliable, thus providing one more argument supporting the va-
lidity of the matrix theory. the computed eective static potential which is short-ranged
and attractive has consequences for thermal properties of d0-branes.

2 matrix theory at nite temperature

the matrix theory [2] is formulated by the reduction of ten dimensional supersymmetric

to one temporal and zero spatial dimensions: a = a( ),  = ( ).

the thermal partition function is given by the euclidean path integral

zym = z [da( )][d( )]esym[a,],

(1)

(2)

where the time-coordinate is periodic. the bosonic and fermionic coordinates have, re-
spectively, periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions

a( + ) = a( ),

( + ) = ( ),

 = 1/t,

(3)

where t is the temperature. gauge xing involves introducing ghost elds which have
periodic boundary conditions.

the representation (2) of the thermal partition function can be derived in the standard
way starting from the known hamiltonian of the matrix theory [2] and representing the
thermal partition function

zym = tr eh

(4)

via the path integral. the trace is calculated over all states obeying gausss law which is
taken care by the integration over a0 in (2). this representation of the matrix theory at
nite temperature have been discussed in refs. [3, 4, 5].

the diagonal components of the gauge elds, ~a  ~a, are interpreted in the matrix
theory as the positions of the -th d0-brane and should be treated as collective variables.
static congurations play a special role since they satisfy classical equations of motion
with the periodic boundary conditions and dominate the path integral as g2
ym  0.
there are no such static zero modes for fermionic components since they would not
satisfy the antiperiodic boundary conditions. this is an important dierence from the
zero temperature case and a manifestation of the fact that supersymmetry is explicitly
broken by non-zero temperature.

an eective action for these coordinates is constructed by integrating the o-diagonal

components of the gauge elds, the fermionic variables and the ghosts:

se[~a]   lnz y6=

[da

0 ][da

 ][d][dghost]esymsgf sgh.

(5)

generally, this integration can only be done in the a simultaneous loop expansion and
expansion in the number of derivatives of the coordinates ~a. such an expansion is
are large for each pair of d0-branes and where
their velocities are small. the remaining dynamical problem then denes the statistical
mechanics of a gas of d0-branes:

accurate in the limit where (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

the d0-branes.

4 comparison with superstring theory

4.1 open string language

the starting point is the thermal partition function of the single open superstring:

z1str  f = tr eh,

(17)

where h is the superstring hamiltonian and the trace is over all physical (gso projected)
superstring states.

since the ends of the open string end on two d0-branes separated by the distance l,
the superstring has the neumann boundary condition along the temporal direction and
the dirichlet boundary conditions along the nine spatial directions. the corresponding
superstring spectrum is given by

en = s l2

42 + n,

(18)

where n are eigenvalues of the oscillator number operator.

knowing the spectrum (18), the thermal partition function of the string gas can be

immediately written as

2dn

,

(19)

zstr(, l, ) = ef =



yn =0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
1  enl!8
yn=1  1 + enl

=



1 + een +i

1  een +i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
xn =0

dn en l.



where dn stands for the degeneracy of either bosonic of fermionic superstring states at
level n:

8

(20)

for the lowest levels, d0 = 8 and e0 = l/2. the factor of 2 in the exponent 2dn in
(19) is the famous one by polchinski [6] and is due to the interchange of the superstring
ends. it is crucial in providing the agreement with the matrix theory computation.

the physical meaning of eq. (19) is obvious: the partition function is equal to the
ratio of the fermi and bose distributions with the power being (twice) the degeneracy of
the states.

equation (19) is derived in ref. [7] (in ref. [8] for dp-branes) by calculating the annulus
diagram for the open superstring in compactied euclidean time of the circumference .
the parameter  has the meaning of the constant u(1) gauge eld which enters though
the quantized temporal momentum p0 = 2(r  )/ of the open string whose world-
sheet winds aroung the space-time cylinder as is depicted in fig. 1. in the above formula,
r is integer in the ns sector (associated with space-time bosons) and half-integer in the
r sector (associated with space-time fermions).

l

figure 1: space-time cylinder. the bold lines represent world-lines of the two d0-branes which go along the periodic
temporal direction and are separated by the distance l. they bound the string world-sheet which can wind around the
cylinder.

in order to compare with the yang-mills computation, we identify the coordinates of
d0-branes with ~q = 2~a, so that the separation is l = 2|~a1  ~a2|. then the
integrand in (16) coincides for n=2 with (19) truncated to the massless modes (n = 0)
provided  = (a1

0  a2
0).

the truncation of the stringy modes is justied for   l (or t l  1) when the

energy gap  between the rst two levels is nite. from (18) we get

 = s(cid:18) l
2(cid:19)

2

+

1
 

l

2

(21)

and the spectrum can be truncated at the rst level when and only when   1. if
the temperature is small, this condition is always satised unless the length l is not too
large.

the integration over a0s in eq. (16) corresponds to the integration over  in eq. (19).
this integration comes about in the string theory as follows. the open-string gauge eld
a0 interacts with d0-branes adding the surface term to the action:

sint = z dqa = z 

0

d (cid:16)a0(, ~q1)  a0(, ~q2)(cid:17) = 

(22)

the matrix theory automatically takes into account the integration over a0 while in the
string theory calculation of ref. [7] the open-string gauge eld is xed. this intergation
over a0 is needed to provide gausss law for the charges at the ends of the open string
which are induced on d-branes. therefore, the eective potential between static d0-
branes in the superstring theory is given by

se[~a] =  lnz 1

1

d zstr(, l, ).

(23)

this issue will be further discussed in the next subsection.

4.2 closed string language

at least two issues remain unclear in the open string language. firstly, why to exponetiate
the single string partition function to get the string gas and, secondly, why to integrate
over  the string gas partition function (19) rather than, say, the single string partition
function (17)? this has a natural explanation in the closed string language.

the passage to a closed string is performed by the standard modular transformation
which converts the annulus diagram for an open string into a cylinder diagram for a closed

5

string. the right-hand side of eq. (17) can then be represented as [7]

f (l, , ) =

(24)

2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ez(2q+1)2/4+i(2q+1) .

(25)

the meaning of eq. (24) is that of the closed-string propagator, which describes the
interaction between d0-branes, rather than the thermal partition function as for an open
string.

the sum over q in eq. (24) represents the sum over all possible winding numbers w =
2q + 1 of the closed string around the compact dimension x0. only odd winding numbers
survive since the contribution of the even ones vanishes due to supersymmetry. the
vanishing of the term with zero winding number is analogous to that at zero temperature
and is due to the cancellation between the ns-ns and r-r sectors.

when two d0-branes interact, they can exchange several closed strings, not necessar-
ily one. all such exchanges are of the same order of magnitude in the string coupling
constant and exponentiate since the closed strings are identical. this is analogous to the
exponentiation of the single-gluon exchange when the interaction between static quark
and antiquark in the yangmills theory is calculated via the correlator of two polyakov
loops. therefore, eq. (19) naturally emerges in the closed string language. it is also clear
why there is only one  for each multi-string term: we have just two interacting d0-branes
rather than a gas of d0-branes. this results in eq. (23).

each of the closed strings mediating the interaction between d0-branes has its own
winding number wi. in the open string language, this induces on the d-brane the charge

since they are missing at zero temperature where x0 is not compact and there are no
windings along the x0 direction, so that the total charge equals zero at each value of the

pi wi with respect to the open-string gauge eld. such charged states look suspicious
time  . but the integration over  picks up exactly the state with pi wi = 0, i.e. which is

not charged! in particular, all states with a single closed string vanish after the integration
over . the leading order contribution to the d0-brane interaction comes from the state
with two closed strings having unit winding numbers of opposite signs.

it is worth nothing that in the closed string language wi is associated with the ns-ns

charge of the closed string. therefore, the condition pi wi = 0 implies the vanishing of

the total ns-ns charge.

5 discussion

the eective static potential between two d0-branes emerges because supersymmetry is
broken by nite temperature. this eect of breaking supersymmetry is somewhat analo-
gous to the velocity eects at zero temperature where the matrix theory and superstring
computations agree to the leading order of the velocity expansion [9]. it is thus shown that
the leading term in a low temperature expansion is correctly reproduced by the matrix
theory.

the eective static potential between d0-branes at one loop is logarithmic and attrac-
tive at short distances. the singularity occurs when the distance between the d0-branes
vanishes and the su(n) symmetry which is broken by nite distances is restored. the

6

integration over the o-diagonal components of the gauge eld can no longer be treated in
the one-loop approximation! (this issue has been further discussed recently in ref. [10].)
in the superstring theory, the singularity is exactly the same as in the matrix theory since
it is determined only by the massless bosonic modes in the ns sector.

the computed partition functions take into account only thermal uctuations of su-
perstring stretched between d0-branes but not the uctuations of d0-branes themselves.
these separation of the degrees of freedom is justied by the fact that d0-branes have

a mass 1/gs and are very heavy as gs  0. to calculate the thermal partition func-

tion of d0-branes, a further path integration over their periodic trajectories ~a( ) is to
be performed as in (6). classical statistics is not applicable to this problem due to the
singularity of the one-loop eective static potential at small distances in spite of tha fact
that d0-branes are very heavy. however, this singularity is only in the classical partition
function. the path integral over the periodic trajectories ~a( ) can not diverge since the
two-body quantum mechanical problem has a well-dened spectrum.
