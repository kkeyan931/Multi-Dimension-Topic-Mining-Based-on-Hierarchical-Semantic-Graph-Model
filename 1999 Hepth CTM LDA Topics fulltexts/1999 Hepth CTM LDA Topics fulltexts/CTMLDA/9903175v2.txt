abstract

chiral superelds have been used, and extensively, almost ever since
supersymmetry has been discovered. complex linear superelds aord
an alternate representation of matter, but are widely misbelieved to be
physically equivalent to chiral ones. we prove the opposite is true.
curiously, this re-enables a previously thwarted interpretation of the
low-energy (super)eld limit of superstrings.

brevity is the soul of wit.

0. introduction

chiral superelds and their conjugates have been used for over two decades [1,2,3,4,5].
they are dened by a system of two homogeneous, simple, rst order superdierential
equations:

[d , ] = 0 ,

[d, ] = 0 ,

(1)

written here in n =1 supersymmetric 4-dimensional spacetime notation. the complex
linear supereld [6,7], , and its conjugate, , are dened to obey the homogeneous,
single, second order superdierential equations:

where [1]:

[d2, ] = 0 ,

[d2, ] = 0 ,

d2 = dd = dd ,

and d2 = d d  =   d d  .

(2)

(3)

the complex linear supereld is also called non-minimal chiral supereld, as its dening
equation is closely related to those of the chiral supereld (1); in retrospect,  ought to
be called minimal chiral[8]. for the purposes of this short note, we adopt the shorter,
chiral and linear names, and moreover use only complex such elds.

the simple lagrangian densities

 =z d4  ,

l(0)

and l(0)

 = z d4  ,

(4)

rewritten in terms of the component elds are in a 11 correspondence after the elimina-
tion of auxiliary component elds [2]. even in the current literature, this fact has been
misinterpreted into a proof that chiral and linear superelds are physically equivalent.

herein, we dispell such and related delusions by oering two simple proofs, which
rely only on the denition of these superelds, and focus on two very distinct aspects of
the inequivalence between them. these proofs encompass, mutatis mutandis, all of the
minimal and non-minimal haploid superelds of ref. [8].

1. 1st proof: correlation functions

it is a rather well exploited fact that chiral superelds form a ring. in fact, any analytic
function of a collection of chiral superelds is also a chiral supereld.

this, rather obviously, is not the case with linear superelds: no nonlinear function
of even a single linear supereld is linear, i.e., obeys eqs. (2). that is, the set of linear
superelds is not closed under multiplication: the product 12 does not obey eq. (2).

this simple mathematical fact has an extraordinary consequence when comparing
any two models using chiral vs. linear superelds. supersymmetric correlation functions of
chiral superelds are always independent of the (spacetime) position of the superelds [9]:



xm
1

h|12|i =d (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16) 1
1 (cid:17)2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e    
| {z }0

m h| q 

   

xm

 1 

m h|(cid:8)q , [q, 1](cid:9)2|i ,

(5)

[q, 1]2 + [q, 1]2 q  |i

 0 ,

| {z }0

where |i is any supersymmetric vacuum, annihilated by all the supercharges, and we
used the dening equations (1). thus, models involving chiral superelds always have a
topological (more properly, rigid) sector among their correlation functions.

by stark contrast and as a consequence of their diering denition only, no such
rigidity obtains for supersymmetric correlation functions of products of linear superelds:
models built with linear superelds in place of chiral ones have no such topological sector.
as correlation functions determine a (quantum) model, it follows that models with

linear superelds are fundamentally inequivalent to models with chiral superelds.

2. 2nd proof: gauge interactions, in 2 dimensions

recall that eqs. (1) and (2) hold also in 2-dimensions, but the lorentz group now becoming
sl(2, c)  so(1, 1)  u (1), we drop the over-dots on the spinorial indices.

consider coupling these superelds to a gauge symmetry. as shown in ref. [10], 2-
dimensional supersymmetric theories admit a twisted version of the usual gauge vector
multiplet the covariant (super)derivatives of which satisfy ( m = 1, 2):

{, } = 4ig3

p ,

{, } = 2i m

 m ,

(6)

where p is the lie algebra valued supereld the superderivatives of which provide the
twisted versions of the usual fermionic and bosonic eld strengths and the auxiliary eld:

in the presence of a gauge symmetry, the denitions (1) and (2) need to be modied into

[, p] = fw  ,

[,fw] = (cid:0)ef + ied(cid:1) .

(7)

and

[, ] = 0 ,

[, ] = 0 ,

2
[

, ] = 0 ,

[2, ] = 0 .

(8)

(9)

note that, as dened above, p automatically satises the latter of eqs. (8); its conjugate,

p is then chiral, whence we call {p,fw, ef ,ed} the chiral vector multiplet. the dimen-

sionally reduced standard gauge multiplet is likewise determined from a twisted chiral
supereld [10], , and we call {, w, f, d} the twisted gauge vector multiplet.

there is an integrability condition one can derive for the chiral superelds [10], by

anticommuting [, ] in (8)with , and antisymmetrizing:

this implies that covariantly chiral superelds (8) must be chargeless with respect to the

0 =(cid:8), [, ](cid:9) +(cid:8), [, ](cid:9) =(cid:2){, }, (cid:3) def= 4ig3
gauge group generated by the chiral gauge vector multiplet {p,fw, ef ,ed}.

again, as a consequence of their diering denition only, no such restriction obtains

[p, ] .

(10)

for the covariantly linear supereld (9).

the mirror of this argument proves that superelds which are covariantly twisted-
chiral with respect to the twisted gauge multiplet must also be chargeless with respect to
this gauge symmetry.

 2 

to sum up, covariantly chiral superelds couple to the twisted but not to the chiral
gauge multiplet (6), while covariantly twisted-chiral superelds couple to the chiral but not
to the twisted vector multiplet. by stark contrast, both linear superelds and their mirror-
twisted brethren couple indiscriminately to both chiral and twisted gauge multiplets, and
so cannot possibly be equivalent to the discriminately coupling (twisted-)chiral ilk.

3. an old proof opens new possibilities

an unassuming remark in ref. [2], p. 200, states: it is not possible to introduce arbitrary
mass and nonderivative self-interaction terms for the linear complex supereld.

this is clear from the fact that the denition of a chiral supereld (1) ensures that its

most general lagrangian density takes the form:

l =z d4 k(, ) +z d2 w () + h.c. ,

(11)

whereas the denition of a linear supereld (2) restricts its most general lagrangian to:

l =z d4 f (, ) + h.c.

(12)

besides the sophisticated consequences for renormalization 1), an important dierence be-
tween (11) and (12) is based on dimensional grounds only: when restricted to be renor-
malizable, in 4 dimensions, l admits no mass parameter and must be quadratic!

this proves that renormalizable models with (only) linear superelds cannot describe
massive elds with yukawa interactions, whereas renormalizable models with chiral super-
elds can. the two then cannot possibly be equivalenteven in the free eld limit!

this brings about an interesting possibility. recall that the eective low-energy (su-
per)eld limit of superstring theories [11,12] is identied based only on physical (propagat-
ing) degrees of freedom. it is then logically possible that the limit in fact ought to involve
linear instead of chiral superelds. if so, matter elds descending from superstrings would
be massless and have only gauge interactions. this is precisely as needed for the models
discussed in ref. [13], which when using chiral superelds end up thwarted mainly by
yukawa intereactions.

note also that the combined use of chiral and linear superelds enables the description
of phenomena not describable by the use of either one of the superelds alone [14]. indeed,
owing to no self-interaction, linear superelds are well adapted to describe the atness
of (co)tangent spaces. this is not unlike the richness in 2-dimensional (super)spacetime,
made possible by the joint use of chiral and twisted-chiral superelds in ref. [15], and a
far greater richness made possible by the use of many other types of superelds [8].
