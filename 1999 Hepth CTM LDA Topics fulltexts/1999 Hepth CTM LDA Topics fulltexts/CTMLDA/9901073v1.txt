we investigate monopole solutions for the born-infeld higgs system. we analyze numerically
these solutions and compare them with the standard t hooft-polyakov monopoles. we also discuss
the existence of a critical value of  (the born-infeld absolute eld parameter) below which no
regular solution exists.

i. introduction

classical solutions for the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) theories are useful in the understanding of brane dynamics [1]-
[3]. in this respect, bions and soliton like solutions have recently attracted much attention [2]- [4]; in particular, vortex
and monopole solutions have been investigated [2]- [7].

concerning monopoles, it was shown in [6] that it is possible to construct a dbi action coupled to a higgs scalar in
such a way that the usual bps monopole solution to the yang-mills-higgs theory also solves the resulting (rst-order)
equations of motion. to this end, one has to endow the higgs eld with dynamics also described by a square-root born-
infeld like lagrangian and also consider the prassad-sommereld   0 limit for the symmetry breaking potential.
being the solution that of a bps monopole, one does not capture any features associated with born-infeld dynamics
and, in particular, the resulting solution is insensitive to the value of , the absolute eld parameter in born-infeld
models. in contrast, a critical value c was discovered in a previous investigation of vortex solutions in abelian dbi
theories [7], such that no soliton solution exists for   c, this showing how dbi dynamics determines the nature of
soliton solutions.
in this work we shall discuss monopole solutions in so(3) dbi gauge theories coupled to a higgs triplet which
enters through the usual kinetic energy term, lhiggs  tr(dd). concerning the way in which the non-abelian
dbi scalar lagrangian is dened, there exist dierent possibilities among which we consider taking (i) the usual
trace over internal indices of the square root dbi lagrangian dened through its power series expansion and (ii) the
symmetric trace advocated by tseytlin [8] as a way to make contact with the low energy eective action derived
from superstring theories.

the paper is organized as follows: we present in section ii the so(3) dbi-higgs action, discuss the spherically
symmetric ansatz and derive the radial equations of motion both for the usual and the symmetric trace. in section
iii we describe our numerical solutions and discuss their main properties. we give in section iv analytical arguments
giving support to the existence of critical values for  bellow which the monopole solution ceases to exist. finally we
present in section v a summary of our results and the conclusions.

ii. the lagrangian and the monopole ansatz

the t hooft-polyakov monopole solution [9]- [10] to the equations of motion of the yang-mills-higgs lagrangian
owes its existence and main properties to the non-abelian character of an ansatz for the gauge and scalar elds, mixing

space-time and internal indices in such a way that ensures topological non-triviality and regularity of the resulting
solution. in order to look for analogous solutions in the dbi theory, one should necessarily start from a non-abelian
version of the born-infeld theory and also decide how the higgs eld will be coupled to the gauge eld.

the denition of the dbi theory for a non-abelian gauge group is not unique and several alternatives have been
discussed in the literature, [8], [11]- [16]. the simplest extension amounts to dene the gauge eld lagrangian in the
form

ltr

dbi = 2tr(cid:18)1 r1 +

1
22 f f  

1

84 (f f  )2(cid:19) .

(1)

here f is the eld strength taking values in the lie algebra of the gauge group (which we take for simplicity as
so(3)),

f = a  a + e[a, a ]

a = aa

ta = ~a  ~t ,

~t =

~
2

,

f =

1

f 

and tr in eq. (1) represents the usual trace on so(3) indices, with generators normalized so that

a second possibility is to dene a symmetric trace operation,

tr(tatb) = ab

str(t1, t2, . . . , tn ) 

1

n !x

tr(t(1)t(2) . . . t(n ))

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

with the sum extending over all permutations  of the product of n given ts. then, the dbi lagrangian is dened
as

lstr

dbi = 2str(cid:18)1 r1 +

1
22 f f  

1

84 (f f )2(cid:19) .

remarkably, the r.h.s. in (7) can be written in this case in terms of a determinant,

lstr

dbi = 2str(cid:18)1 rdet(g +

1


f )(cid:19)

(7)

(8)

thus making contact with the tree level open string eective action for branes, [8]. of course, g in eq. (8) is the
3 + 1 usual minkowski space-time metric, g = diag(1,1,1,1), and not the pullback of the d + 1 dimensional
minkowski metric to the p + 1 dimensional world volume of the p-brane. it should be mentioned that odd powers
of the eld strength f are absent from the expansion of lstr this implying that f (although possibly large) should
be slow varying since f 3  [d, d]f 2. in this sense using str amounts to some kind of abelian approximation. it
should be noted that some unsolved problems related to the use of a symmetric trace have been signaled. they refer
to discrepancies between the results that arise from a symmetrized non-abelian born infeld theory and the expected
spectrum of brane theories [12].

apart from this alternatives related to the way the trace operation is dened, one has to decide how the higgs
eld dynamics is introduced. in previous analysis, dbi monopoles were constructed by demanding that the usual
yang-mills-higgs bps relations also hold in the dbi case [6]. this amounts to dene a higgs eld lagrangian in a
born-infeld-like way (i.e., also under a square root) in such a way that the model has a supersymmetric extension [4],
[14]- [16]. being the bps relations the same as in the yang-mills-higgs case, the resulting dbi monopole solutions
are identical to the well-honored prassad-sommereld exact solutions and have no specic features resulting from
the dbi dynamics. instead, we shall consider here the usual so(3) higgs eld lagrangian and a symmetry breaking
potential not necessarily in the bps limit. we then propose the following lagrangian for the higgs eld:

from here on we shall consider purely magnetic congurations for which f f  = 0 . then the equations of motion

this expression reduces to the t hooft-polyakov monopole mass formula in the    limit, as expected.

now, since we are considering dbi dynamics, we have to distinguish between the magnetic induction ~b and the
magnetic intensity ~h,

using ansatz (16)-(18) one easily nds that

bi =

h i =

so that the magnetic ux at innity,

(30)

(31)

(32)

corresponds to that of a unit magnetic monopole located at the origin. the magnetic ux  can alternatively be
dened in terms of ~h, this leading to the same answer (32).

(ii) the equations of motion for lstr

dbihiggs

when the symmetric trace operation is used, the dbi-higgs lagrangian is dened as

lstr

dbihiggs = 2 str(cid:18)1 r1 +

again we will only consider purely magnetic congurations so f f  = 0. because of the use of the symmetric trace,
deriving the equations of motion in this case becomes rather involved. indeed, one has rst to expand the square root
in lstr in powers of 1/2 and at each order n , consider the n ! terms which are included in str. for example, up to
order 1/2 one has for the purely dbi lagrangian

lstr
dbi =

~f  ~f  +

1

962 (cid:16)( ~f  ~f )2 + 2( ~f  ~f)( ~f   ~f )(cid:17) + o(

f 6
4 ) .

already at this order, this dbi lagrangian diers from the one arising when one expands ltr

dbi ,

ltr
dbi = 

1
4

~f  ~f  +

1
322 ( ~f  ~f )2 + o(

f 6
4 ) .

(34)

(35)

the 1/4 term in the expansion of lstr
dbi involves 120 terms containing the sixth power of the eld strength, this
making the search of a solution using a numerical approach too complicated. we shall here consider the problem
to the 1/2 order given in equation (34) and analyze how the solution diers from the one obtained using the more
simple tr operation.

the equations of motion for the gauge eld resulting from (34) read

d(cid:18) ~f  

1

122 (cid:16)( ~f. ~f ) ~f  + 2( ~f. ~f ) ~f (cid:17)(cid:19) = e~  ~d

while those associated to the higgs eld remain unchanged.

after using the spherically symmetric ansatz (16)-(18), eq.(36) becomes

iii. numerical results

to obtain a detailed prole of the monopole solution, we solved numerically the dierential equations (25)-(27) for
the case of the trace operation tr and (37), (38), and (26) for the symmetric trace str. we employed a relaxation
method for boundary value problems [18]. such method determines the solution by starting with an initial guess and
improving it iteratively. the natural initial guess was the exact prassad-sommereld solution [19] (which corresponds
to 0 = 0 and   ).

5

(i) the usual trace

for  > 10, the solutions to eqs. (25)-(27) do not dier appreciably from the t hooft-polyakov monopole solution
(see for example [20] for a plot of the t hooft-polyakov solution). as  decreases, the solution changes slowly: the
monopole radius decreases and the (radial) magnetic eld ~h concentrates at the origin. some of the solutions prole
are depicted in gures (1) and (2).

for   1 new features become apparent from our numerical analysis. in particular, we found that:

1- for 0 = 0 the behavior of the higgs eld at large distances depends on ,

h(r)  0r + c(/2) for r  

(40)

in the prassad-sommereld limit). of course, for   , c(/2)  1 and one
(here 0 is the higgs eld v.e.v.
has the usual asymptotic behavior of the higgs eld for the t hooft-polyakov monopole. for nite , however, it is
interesting to note that the 1/r fallo, which in the yang-mills-higgs case is related to the massless dilaton associated
to the scale invariance of the bps regime, has now a  dependent coecient.
2- there is a critical value of , which we shall denote as c, such that for   c there is no (numerical) solution to
the equations of motion (25)-(27). some values for c are: c = 0.41 for 0 = 0, c = 0.62 for 0 = 0.5.
this peculiar characteristic of the solutions appears to be a consequence of the high nonlinearity of the equations
and not a ctitious artifact of the numerical method. moreover, the energy of the solutions seems to be singular at
 = c (see gure (3)).

(ii) the symmetric trace

for this case we solved the eqs. (37), (38) and (26) with the same numerical approach. since the equations are valid

to order 1/2, our analysis cannot be reliable for small . we see that for  >
from those arising when the trace operation tr is considered. the prole of the solutions are indistinguishable from
the solid-line curves of gures (1) and (2). in view of our approximation, we could not analyze the region where one
expects the existence of c in this case.

 4 the solutions do not dier notably

iv. analysis of c

as noted in the introduction, the existence of a critical value of the absolute eld below which the solution to the
equations of motion of the dbi-higgs system ceases to exist, was already noticed for vortices in the abelian case [7]
and should be considered as a distinctive feature of soliton solutions in dbi theories.

in order to better understand the origin of c let us introduce the following scaling argument. for a monopole
like solution, there is a characteristic radius rw that can be associated with the monopole core; outside this core,
the gauge eld approaches to its asymptotic value. for yang-mills-higgs monopoles (or nielsen-olesen vortices), this
radius should be necessarily related to , the sole parameter carrying dimensions, rw  1/. the size rw is xed
so as to minimize the sum of the energy stored in the magnetic eld outside the core and the energy due to the scalar
eld gradient inside the core. the resulting value rw is in this case rw = 1/mw , with mw the mass of the gauge
boson, mw = (e/). a second length playing a role in the monopole conguration is related to the size of the
region outside of which the higgs scalar takes practically its vacuum expectation value. we shall call the radius of
this region rh . for the yang-mills-higgs system one has rh = 1/. from rw and rh we can dene a dimensionless
parameter v measuring the relative intensity of the two coupling constants in the theory,

v 

rh
rw

=

e


(41)

(in the vortex case 1/v coincides with the ginzburg-landau parameter separating the two types of superconductivity).
for v  1 one has a well dened monopole conguration.
now, when dbi-higgs monopoles are considered, there is, apart from , a second dimensionful parameter, ,
[] = []2. then rw and rh could in principle depend both on  and  and the conguration minimizing the energy
will result from the matching of both parameters determining the size of the monopole. it may happen that in some

6

region of the (, ) domain such a matching becomes not possible. the outcome will be the non-existence of solutions
in a range of values of  with size related to c. in view of the complexity of the non-linear coupled system (25)-(27),
let us analyze this possibility by using an approximate monopole conguration sharing the main features of the true
solution:

r

kapp(r) =(cid:16)1 
happ(r) = r(cid:18)1 

r(cid:17) (r  r)
r2(cid:19)2

r2
0

(r  r0).

(42)

(43)

here r and r0 are parameters controlling the shape of the gauge eld and scalar eld congurations and they have
to be determined by minimizing the energy e of the conguration. one can relate r and r0 with rw and rh
by searching in (42)-(43) for the values of r for which the gauge and scalar eld congurations dier in 1
e from its
asymptotic. this gives rw  (1/2)r, rh  3r0 and in this sense one can think that r = r(, ) and r0 = r0(, ).
let us nally note that using eq.(41) one can write v in terms of r0 and r,

v  6

r0
r  6x .

(44)

we have seen that for large  (say  >

 5), the dbi-higgs theory just gives the same answer as the yang-mills-
higgs model so that one should always nd in this region values for r and r0 minimizing e. in particular, in the
   case we found using our approximate congurations that one has, for 0 = 0.5, x = 0.128. this giving for v
the result approximate result vapp  6x  0.8 to be compared with the exact result for yang-mills-higgs theory,
v = 1/0 = 2.
now, for small  the situation radically changes. indeed, using (42) and (43) one nds for the energy, to second

order in  (apart of an irrelevant additive constant):

e = r(cid:0)0.33 + 0.03 + 3.04 x + 3.33 x2  8.53 x3 + 2 x4
= 2.1r3x3  r (f (x) + 0.03) + o (3) .

0.13 x6 + 0.01 x8 + 8 x2 log(x)(cid:1) + 2.1r3x3 + o(3)

(45)

it is not dicult to show that for small  (and any ) the above expression does not have a minimun for any r and
x. we conjecture that this phenomenon occurring for an approximate conguration also takes place for the actual
monopole solution: below a critical  value, there is no possible matching between the monopole core and the size of
the region where the higgs scalar is dierent from its vacuum value, in such a way the energy is minimized.

v. summary and conclusions

we have discussed in this work monopole solutions for an so(3) dirac-born-infeld gauge theory coupled to a higgs
scalar. we considered two alternative lagrangians for the theory, diering in the way the trace over group indices is
taken. concerning the higgs eld, we have chosen the usual kinetic energy term and symmetry breaking potential.

as in the case of the yang-mills-higgs system, a spherically symmetric ansatz leads to a system of coupled non-
linear radial equations that have to be solved numerically. we have seen that the magnetic eld corresponds, as in the
t hooft-polyakov case, to that of a monopole with unit charge. when the absolute eld  parameter is large ( >
the prole of the monopole solution is practically the same as the corresponding to the yang-mills-higgs model. as 
decreases, the monopole radius becomes smaller and the magnetic eld concentrates more and more near the origin.
a remarkable eect takes place for small : there exists a critical value c such that for   c the solution ceases
to exist. the actual value of c depends on the choice of the other free parameters. we presented an scaling argument
that supports this result: using an approximate solution that depends only on the dimensions of the conguration we
showed that for small values of  it is impossible to adjust the size parameters to minimize the energy.

 5)

the monopole solution we have presented has many remarkable features that make worth a thorough investigation.
in particular, the analysis of dyon solutions, which implies the inclusion of the (f f )2 term in the dbi action should
reveal new features related to the existence of the dimensionfull parameter . we hope to discuss this problem in a
future work.
