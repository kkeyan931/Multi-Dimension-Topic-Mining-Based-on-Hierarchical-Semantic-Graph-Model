the computation of mode sums of the types encountered in basic quantum eld theoretic
applications is addressed with an emphasis on their expansions into functions of distance
that can be interpreted as potentials. we show how to regularize and calculate the casimir
energy for the continuum nambu-goto string with massive ends as well as for the discrete
isgur-paton non-relativistic string with massive ends. as an additional example, we examine
the eect on the interquark potential of a constant kalb-ramond eld strength interacting
with a qcd string.

i. introduction

the determination of the casimir energy or zero-point energy for a quantum system through the evaluation
of the mode sum is a problem of quite practical importance. these sums are almost always divergent and need
regularization in order to be interpreted sensibly. the interpretation of the result as a background energy
or potential is made most evident if the sum can be expressed in terms of simple functions of distance, that
can be put into one to one correspondence with simple potential terms such as coulombic or centripetal
potential components. the purpose of this paper is to illustrate how this can be done for several classes of
mode sums encountered recently in the literature.

ii. continuum qcd string with massive ends

we begin by examining the computation of the casimir energy for a static string with massive ends that

is allowed to vibrate transversely.

the eigenfrequencies for a vibrating nambu-goto string of length r and tension a, terminated by two
massive quarks of mass m that are allowed to move only transversely has been given by lambiase and
nesterenko [1] as the roots of the transcendental equation

f () = (m 22  a2) sin r  2m a cos r = 0 .

(1)

the casimir energy, which is half the sum of these eigenfrequencies, can be calculated with aid of the
watson-sommerfeld transform

ecasimir =

n =

1

4iic

 d

d
d

ln f () ,

(2)

where the contour c encloses the roots of f (), all of which lie on the positive real axis for physically
meaningful frequencies. the energy computed in eq. (2) is the energy per transverse degree of freedom. in
d dimensions, there would be an extra factor of d  2. the sum in eq. (2) is formally innite and must be
regularized and renormalized. we deform the contour to include the entire left half-plane and keep only the
regular portion

ln(cid:2)(m 2y2 + a2) sinh ry + 2m ay cosh ry(cid:3) .

the evaluation of the casimir energy for small s can be performed as follows. for very small s (large masses
m ) the approximation,

is extremely accurate. the logarithm can be expanded

8s(cid:19) +  ,

(10)

(13)

(14)

(15)

which agrees extremely well with numerical evaluations of the integral for small s, as can be seen in fig. 1.
a comparison of the series (15) and the sum (14) is shown in fig. 2. if more accuracy is needed for larger
values of s, higher terms in s in the exponent of eq. (10) can be retained and those contributions to the
exponent expanded in a power series.

if the quark mass m is large, we can use the approximation eq. (15), to calculate the lowest order
m to the casimir energy. from the denition eq. (9), we nd the casimir energy per

corrections in 1
transverse degree of freedom

ecasimir =

iii. evaluation of a sum of bessel functions

in this section we evaluate the sum

g(x) =

1
n



xn=1

k1(nx) ,

(16)

(17)

for small x. this sum appears in the evaluation of functional determinants [2] as well as casimir energies
[1,3]. related sums of bessel functions appear in generic one-loop nite temperature eective potentials for
guts [4], and also appear in the mathematics literature [5].

evaluation of this sum using zeta functions quickly becomes problematic because no matter how small x
is, for suciently large n values, n x   and small x expansions of k1(x) cannot be used. however, we
can use another integral representation of the bessel function,

k1(nx) =

together with the sum

xn=1

where [t] is the greatest integer less than t and b2(t) is the second bernoulli polynomial,

b2(t) =

1

we obtain

we may split this expression into the rst term and a remainder

2b2(t)

3
2

dt + 2xz

the remainder may be written as a sum,

dt = 2x



xm=1z 1

2b2(t)

which may then be expanded for small x in a binomial series;

(18)

(20)

(21)

finally, we rewrite this expression in term of the generalized zeta function

g(x) = 2xz 1

(25)

all of these integrals are strongly convergent, which is obvious from simple power counting for all but the
k = 0 term, which we will explicitly evaluate. the integral in the rst term, which is dominant for x  0, is
elementary

for the k = 0 term, we replace the sum of integrals by its original form to obtain

iv. qcd string interacting with monopole current

the physics of charged particles moving in a plane under the inuence of a constant magnetic eld is a
very beautiful and enlightening subject containing such surprises as the quantum hall eect. the string
analog of a charge moving in a constant magnetic eld is the motion of a string in a constant kalb-ramond
[6] eld strength

h0ij(x) = 0 ,
hijk(x) = hijk .

(36)

this system is a model of a qcd string interacting with a constant monopole density and, like the landau
problem, is also exactly solvable [7]. (the monopole current is proportional to the dual of h: j 
monopole 
h.) the kalb-ramond potential b corresponding to the eld strength (36) is

b0i(x) = 0 ,
h
3

bij(x) =

ijkxk .

(37)

in vortex mechanics, the kalb-ramond eld describes the magnus forces on a vortex line moving in a uid.

the rst-quantized action for a bosonic string moving in a background kalb-ramond eld is

s = 

a

2 z d d (cid:16)

h habax bx  + b (x)abax bx (cid:17) .

(38)

if we substitute the eld bij above into the string action, and we choose orthonormal coordinates on the

worldsheet, we nd the action becomes

s = 

a

2 z d d (cid:18)abax bx  +

h
3

ijkabx iax jbx k(cid:19) ,

and implies the equations of motion

x 0  x 0 = 0 ,
x  x = h x  x .

(39)

(40)

(41)

here we have used reparametrization invariance of the action to set coordinate time equal to laboratory
time  = x0 and to set the spatial parameter of the string equal to the distance in real space along the
string,  = z. we wish to nd the casimir energy of a long straight string acting under the inuence of this
external kalb-ramond eld. we assume the string lies along the z direction and has length r. thus we nd
that x = z, and the linearized equations of motion for the small vibrations on the string become

x  x = h y ,
y  y  = h x .

(42)

we dene the right and left circularly polarized modes x  x  iy , and nd that in terms of them the
small amplitude vibration equations above reduce to

since our string has xed length, we know that the wavelength with either xed dirichlet or neumann

boundary conditions (innitely massive or completely massless quarks at the end) lead to

x  x = ih x .

(43)

x  ih x = x = (cid:16) n
r (cid:17)2

or, if we assume that x = eitx0,

x , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .

(44)

naively, the casimir energy as a function of the kalb-ramond eld strength h is half the sum of all the
frequencies

appear in a large variety of problems (see the references following eq. (5.33) in [1]). we now show the simple
steps with which this sum can be expressed in a form very similar to eq. (14).
first, we subtract out the divergence from the sum in order to regularize it

this and related results are found by a slightly dierent method in ref. [3].

for h  0 this reduces to the xed-end straight string result for two transverse degrees of freedom.

v. discrete isgur-paton string

in this section we consider the interquark potential of a static quark-antiquark pair bound by a ux tube,
considered by isgur and paton [8] and merlin and paton [9] to be a discrete string consisting of n masses m
a distance d apart. this string, when terminated by particles of mass m , has equations of motion [8,9,10]
with the secular equation

p = 1, 2, . . . , n .

this expression agrees very well with the actual sum, plotted as a function of n . this is illustrated in fig. 3.

we note that although the universal luscher term  

m corrections
are completely dierent. in the former case, the correction is o( 1m
m ). of
course, there is no reason to expect that the form of the casimir energies will be the same for the nambu-
goto string and the discrete string of isgur and paton. the former is relativistic while the later is not. in
addition, it is not likely that the casimir energy of a discrete string will go the the continuum result as the
number of mass points is taken to innity. sums and limits generally depend upon the order in which they
are done, especially when the sums are divergent and must be regularized.

vi. conclusions

we have shown how to regularize and perform the zero-point energy mode sums for the discrete non-
relativistic string studied by isgur and paton and the relativistic continuum nambu-goto string. computa-
tion of these divergent sums is necessary in order to obtain the casimir energy of the system to be interpreted
as part of the static potential for quarks bound by a qcd string. we have shown that the lowest order
corrections to the casimir energies in the reciprocal of the mass of the terminating quark is dierent for the
two cases. we have also shown how the addition of a background kalb-ramond eld with a corresponding
constant eld strength aects the static potential. we hope to extend these results to the case of a string
interacting with itself through a kalb-ramond eld.
