abstract

we discuss the derivation of the path integral representation over gauge degrees
of freedom for wilson loops in su (n ) gauge theory and 4dimensional euclidean
spacetime by using wellknown properties of group characters. a discretized form
of the path integral is naturally provided by the properties of group characters
and does not need any articial regularization. we show that the path integral
over gauge degrees of freedom for wilson loops derived by diakonov and petrov
(phys. lett. b224 (1989) 131) by using a special regularization is erroneous and
predicts zero for the wilson loop. this property is obtained by direct evaluation of
path integrals for wilson loops dened for pure su (2) gauge elds and z(2) center
vortices with spatial azimuthal symmetry. further we show that both derivations
given by diakonov and petrov for their regularized path integral, if done correctly,
predict also zero for wilson loops. therefore, the application of their path integral
representation of wilson loops cannot give a new way to check connement in lattice
as has been declared by diakonov and petrov (phys. lett. b242 (1990) 425). from
the path integral representation which we consider we conclude that no new non
abelian stokes theorem can exist for wilson loops except the oldfashioned one
derived by means of the path-ordering procedure.

1 introduction

the hypothesis of quark connement, bridging the hypothesis of the existence of
quarks and the failure of the detection of quarks as isolated objects, is a challenge for
qcd. as a criterion of colour connement in qcd, wilson [1] suggested to consider the
average value of an operator

w (c) =

1
n

trpc ei g hc dx a(x) =

1
n

tr u(cxx),

(1.1)

dened on an closed loop c, where a(x) = ta aa
(x) is a gauge eld, ta (a = 1, . . . , n 21)
are the generators of the su(n) gauge group in fundamental representation normalized
by the condition tr (tatb) = ab/2, g is the gauge coupling constant and pc is the operator
ordering colour matrices along the path c. the trace in eq.(1.1) is computed over colour
indices. the operator

u(cyx) = pcyxe

i g rcyx dz a(z)

,

(1.2)

makes a parallel transport along the path cyx from x to y. for wilson loops the contour c
denes a closed path cxx. for determinations of the parallel transport operator u(cyx) the
action of the pathordering operator pcyx is dened by the following limiting procedure
[2]

u(cyx) = pcxy e

i g rcyx dz a(z)

= lim
n

n

yk=1

u(cxkxk1) =

= lim
n

u(cyxn1) . . . u(cx2x1) u(cx1x) = lim
n

ei g (xk  xk1)  a(xk1),

(1.3)

n

yk=1

where cxkxk1 is an innitesimal segment of the path cyx with x0 = x and xn = y. the
parallel transport operator u(cxkxk1) for an innitesimal segment cxkxk1 is dened by
[2]:

u(cxkxk1) = e

i g rcxk xk1

dz a(z)

= ei g (xk  xk1)  a(xk1).

(1.4)

in accordance with the denition of the pathordering procedure (1.3) the parallel trans-
port operator u(cyx) has the property

u(cyx) = u(cyx1) u(cx1x),

(1.5)

where x1 belongs to the path cyx. under gauge transformations with a gauge function
(z),

a(z)  a

 (z) = (z)a(z)(z) +

1
ig

(z)(z),

the operator u(cyx) has a very simple transformation law

u(cyx)  u (cyx) = (y) u(cyx) (x).

(1.6)

(1.7)

we would like to stress that this equation is valid even if the gauge functions (x) and
(y) dier signicantly for adjacent points x and y.

as has been postulated by wilson [1] the average value of the wilson loop < w (c) >

in the connement regime should show arealaw fallo [1]

< w (c) > e a,

(1.8)

where  and a are the string tension and the minimal area of the loop, respectively. as
usually the minimal area is a rectangle of size l  t . in this case the exponent a can
be represented in the equivalent form  a = v (l) t , where v (l) = l is the interquark
potential and l is the relative distance between quark and antiquark.
the paper is organized as follows. in sect. 2 we discuss the path integral representation
for wilson loops by using wellknown properties of group characters. the discretized form
of this path integral is naturally provided by properties of group characters and does
not need any articial regularization. we derive a closed expression for wilson loops in
irreducible representation j of su(2). in sect. 3 we extend the path integral representation
to the gauge group su(n). as an example, we give an explicit representation for wilson
loops in the fundamental representation of su(3). in sects. 4 and 5 we evaluate the path
integral for wilson loops, suggested in ref.[3], for two specic gauge eld congurations
(i) a pure gauge eld in the fundamental representation of su(2) and (ii) z(2) center
vortices with spatial azimuthal symmetry, respectively. we show that this path integral
representation fails to describe the original wilson loop for both cases.
in sect. 6 we
show that the regularized evolution operator in ref.[3] representing wilson loops in the
form of the path integral over gauge degrees of freedom has been evaluated incorrectly by
diakonov and petrov. the correct value for the evolution operator is zero. this result
agrees with those obtained in sects. 4 and 5. in sect. 7 we criticize the removal of the
oscillating factor from the evolution operator suggested in ref.[3] via a shift of energy
levels of the axialsymmetric top. we show that such a removal is prohibited. it leads to
a change of symmetry of the starting system from su(2) to u(2). keeping the oscillating
factor one gets a vanishing value of wilson loops in agreement with our results in sects. 4,
5 and 6. in the appendix we evaluate the coecients of the expansion used for the path
integrals in sects. 4 and 5.

2 path integral representation for wilson loops

attempts to derive a path integral representation for wilson loops (1.1), where the path
ordering operator is replaced by a path integral, have been undertaken in refs.[35].
the path integral representations have been derived for wilson loops in terms of gauge
degrees of freedom (bosonic variables) [3,4] and fermionic degrees of freedom (grassmann
variables) [5]. for the derivation of the quoted path integral representations for wilson
loop dierent mathematical machineries have been used. below we discuss the derivation
of the path integral representation for wilson loops in terms of gauge degrees of freedom
by using wellknown properties of group characters. in this case a discretized form of path
integrals is naturally provided by the properties of group characters and the completeness
condition of gauge functions. it coincides with the standard discretization of feynman
path integrals [6] and does not need any articial regularization.

3

we argue that the path integral representation for wilson loops suggested by diakonov
and petrov in ref.[3] is erroneous. for the derivation of this path integral representation
diakonov and petrov have used a special regularization drawing an analogy with an axial
symmetric top. the moments of inertia of this top are taken nally to zero. as we show
below this path integral amounts to zero for wilson loops dened for su(2). therefore,
it is not a surprise that the application of this erroneous path integral representation
to the evaluation of the average value of wilson loops has led to the conclusion that
for large loops the arealaw fallo is present for colour charges taken in any irreducible
representation r of su(n) [7]. this statement has not been supported by numerical
simulations within lattice qcd [8]. as has been veried, e.g. in ref.[8] for su(3), in the
conned phase and at large distances, colour charges with nonzero nality have string
tensions of the corresponding fundamental representation, whereas colour charges with
zero nality are screened by gluons and cannot form a string at large distances. hence,
the results obtained in ref.[6] cannot give a new way to check connement in lattice as
has been declared by diakonov and petrov.

for the derivation of wilson loops in the form of a path integral over gauge degrees of
freedom by using wellknown properties of group characters it is convenient to represent
w (c) in terms of characters of irreducible representations of su(n) [911]

wr(c) =

1
dr

[ur(cxx)],

(2.1)

where the matrix ur(cxx) realizes an irreducible and drdimensional matrix representation
r of the group su(n) with the character [ur(cxx)] = tr[ur(cxx)].

in order to introduce the path integral over gauge degrees of freedom we suggest to

use

z dr[ur

r] [rvr] =

1
dr

[urvr],

(2.2)

where the matrices ur and vr belong to the irreducible representation r, and dr is the

haar measure normalized to unity r dr = 1. the completeness condition for gauge

functions r reads

z dr(

r)a1b1

(r)a2b2

=

1
dr

a1b2

b1a2

.

(2.3)

by using the completeness condition it is convenient to represent the wilson loop in the
form of the integral

wr(c) =

1

dr z dr(x)[r(x)ur(cxx)

r(x)].

(2.4)

according to eq.(1.3) and eq.(1.5) the matrix ur(cxx) can be decomposed in

ur(cxx) = lim
n

ur(cxxn1)ur(cxn1xn2) . . . ur(cx2x1)ur(cx1x).

(2.5)

substituting eq.(2.5) in eq.(2.4) and applying (n  1)times eq.(2.2) we end up with

wr(c) =

lim

nz . . .z dr(x1) . . . r(xn) dr[r(xn)ur(cxnxn1)

1
d2
r
. . . dr[r(x1)ur(cx1xn)

r(xn)].

r(xn1)]

(2.6)

4

using relations r(xk)ur(cxkxk1)

r(xk1) = u 

r (cxkxk1) we get

wr(c) =

1
d2
r

lim

nz . . .z dr(x1) . . . dr(xn) dr[u 

r (cxnxn1)] . . . dr[u 

r (cx1xn)].(2.7)

the integrations over r(xk) (k = 1, . . . , n) are well dened. these are standard integra-
tions on the compact lie group su(n).

we should emphasize that the integrations over r(xk) (k = 1, . . . , n) are not corre-

lated and should be carried out independently.

since eq.(2.3) is the completeness condition for group elements, the discretization
of wilson loops given by eqs.(2.6) and (2.7) reproduces the standard discretization of
feynman path integrals [6] where innitesimal time steps can be described by a classical
motion. therefore, the discretized expression (2.7) can be represented formally by

wr(c) =

1
d2

r z yxc

[dr dr(x)] [u 

r (cxx)].

(2.8)

conversely the evaluation of this path integral corresponds to the discretization given
by eqs.(2.6) and (2.7). the measure of the integration over r(x) is well dened and
normalized to unity

z yxc

dr(x) = lim

nz dr(xn)z dr(xn1) . . .z dr(x1) = 1.

(2.9)

thus, for the determination of the path integral over gauge degrees of freedom (2.8) we
do not need to use any regularization, since the discretization given by eqs.(2.6) and (2.7)
are well dened.

we would like to emphasize that eq.(2.8) is a continuum analogy of the lattice version
of the path integral over gauge degrees of freedom for wilson loops used in eq.(2.13) of
ref.[11] for the evaluation of the average value of wilson loops in connection with z(2)
center vortices.

now let us to proceed to the evaluation of the characters [u 

r (cxkxk1)]. due to the
innitesimality of the segments cxkxk1 we can omit the path ordering operator in the
denition of u 
r (cxkxk1)] with
u 

r (cxkxk1) [2]. this allows us to evaluate the character [u 

r (cxkxk1) taken in the form [2]

u 

r (cxkxk1) = exp igzcxk xk1

dxa

 (x).

(2.10)

the evaluation of the characters of u 
r (cxkxk1) given by eq.(2.10) runs as follows. first
let us consider the simplest case, the su(2) gauge group, where we have r = j =
0, 1/2, 1, . . . and dj = 2j + 1. the character [u 

j (cxkxk1)] is equal to [9,10,12]

[u 

j (cxkxk1)] =

=

j

xmj =j
xmj =j

j

< mj|u 

j (cxkxk1)|mj >=

ei mj [cxkxk1; a],

(2.11)

5

where mj is the magnetic colour quantum number, |mj > and mj [cxkxk1; a] are the
eigenstates and eigenvalues of the operator

[cxkxk1; a] = gzcxk xk1

dxa

 (x),

(2.12)

i.e. [cxkxk1; a]|mj > = mj [cxkxk1; a]|mj(xk1) >. the standard procedure for
the evaluation of the eigenvalues gives [cxkxk1; a] in the form

[cxkxk1; a] = gzcxk xk1 qg[a](x)dxdx,

where the metric tensor can be given formally by the expression

g[a](x) = 2 tr[a

 a

 ](x).

(2.13)

(2.14)

in order to nd an explicit expression for the metric tensor we should x a gauge. as an
example let us take the fockschwinger gauge

xa(x) = 0.

(2.15)

in this case the gauge eld a(x) can be expressed in terms of the eld strength tensor
g(x) as follows

a(x) =

1

z0

ds s x g(xs).

(2.16)

this can be proven by using the obvious relation

xg(x) = xa(x)  xa(x)  ig[xa(x), a(x)] =


x

= a(x) + x

a(x),

(2.17)

valid for the fockschwinger gauge xa(x) = 0. replacing x  xs we can represent the
r.h.s. of eq.(2.17) as a total derivative with respect to s

sxg(xs) = a(xs) + x


x

a(xs) =

d
ds

[sa(xs)].

(2.18)

integrating out s  [0, 1] we arrive at eq.(2.16).

using eq.(2.16) we obtain the metric tensor g[a](x) in the form

g[a](x) = 2xx

dsdssstr[(xs)g(xs)(xs)(xs )g(xs )(xs )].

(2.19)

6

for the derivation of eq.(2.19) we dene the operator [cxkxk1; a] of eq.(2.12) following
the denition of the phase of the parallel transport operator u(cxkxk1) given by eq.(1.4)
[2]

[cxkxk1; a] = gzcxk xk1

dxa

 (x) = (xk  xk1)a

 (xk1) =

(2.20)

the parameter s is to some extent an order parameter distinguishing the gauge functions
(xk) and (xk1) entering the relation (xk)u(cxkxk1)(xk1) = u (cxkxk1).

substituting eq.(2.11) in eq.(2.7) we arrive at the expression for wilson loops dened

for su(2)

(2j + 1) e

ighc mj(x)qg[a](x) dxdx . (2.22)

the integrals along the innitesimal segments cxkxk1 we determine as [2]

zcxk xk1

mj(x)qg[a](x) dxdx = mj(xk1)qg[a](xk1) x x =

j qg[a](xk1) x x.

(2.23)

where x = xk  xk1.
comparing the path integral (2.22) with that suggested in eq.(23) of ref.[3] one nds
rather strong disagreement. first, this concerns the contribution of dierent states mj of
the representation j. in the case of the path integral (2.22) there is a summation over all
values of the magnetic colour quantum number mj, whereas the representation of ref.[3]
contains only one term with mj = j. second, ref.[3] claims that in the integrand of

7

their path integral the exponent should depend only on the gauge eld projected onto
the third axis in colour space. however, this is only possible if the gauge functions are
slowly varying with x, i.e. (xk)(xk1)  1. in this case the parallel transport operator
u (cxkxk1) would read [13]

u (cxkxk1) = exp i g zcxk xk1

dx a

 (x) = 1 + i g (xi  xi1)  a(xi1),

(2.24)

and the evaluation of the character [u 

j (cxkxk1] would run as follows

j (cxkxk1)]|mj >= 1 + (ta

< mj|[u 
= 1 + mj i g (xk  xk1)  [a(xk1)](3) = e

j )mj mj i g (xk  xk1)  [a(xk1)](a) =
 (x)](3)
,

dx mj(x)[a

i grcxk xk1

(2.25)

where we have used the matrix elements of the generators of su(2), i.e. (ta
more generally the exponent on the r.h.s. of eq.(2.25) can be written as

j )mj mj = mj a3.

zcxk xk1

dx mj(x) [a

 (x)](3) = 2zcxk xk1

dx mj(x) tr[t3

j a

 (x)].

(2.26)

this gives the path integral representation for wilson loops dened for su(2) in the
following form

wj(c) =

1

(2j + 1)2 z yxc

dj(x) x{mj (x)}

(2j + 1) e2ighc dx mj(x) tr[t3

j a

 (x)].

(2.27)

j a

the exponent contains the gauge eld projected onto the third axis in colour space
tr[t3
 (x)]. nevertheless, eq.(2.27) diers form eq.(23) of ref.[3] by a summation over all
values of the colour magnetic quantum number mj of the given irreducible representation
j.

the repeated application of eq.(2.2) induces that the integrations over the gauge func-
tion at xk are completely independent of the integrations at xk1. there is no mechanism
which leads to gauge functions smoothly varying with xk (k = 1, . . . n). in this sense the
situation is opposite to the quantum mechanical path integral. in quantum mechanics
the integration over all paths is restricted by the kinetic term of the lagrange function.
in the semiclassical limit h  0 due to the kinetic term the uctuations of all trajectories
are shrunk to zero around a classical trajectory. however, in the case of the integration
over gauge functions for the path integral representation of the wilson loop, there is
neither a suppression factor nor a semiclassical limit like h  0. the key point of the
application of eq.(2.2) and, therefore, the path integral representation for wilson loops is
that all integrations over (xk) (k = 1, . . . , n) are completely independent and can dier
substantially even if the points, where the gauge functions (xk) and (xk1) are dened,
are innitesimally close to each other.

for the derivation of eq.(23) of ref.[3] diakonov and petrov have used at an in-
termediate step a regularization drawing an analogy with an axialsymmetric top with
moments of inertia i and ik. within this regularization the evolution operator repre-
senting wilson loops has been replaced by a path integral over dynamical variables of this

8

axialsymmetric top which correspond to gauge degrees of freedom of the nonabelian
gauge eld. the regularized expression of the evolution operator has been obtained in
the limit i, ik  0. the moments of inertia have been used as parameters like h  0.
unfortunately, as we show in sect. 6 the limit i, ik  0 has been evaluated incorrectly.

3 the su (n ) extension

the extension of the path integral representation given in eq.(2.24) to su(n) is rather
straightforward and reduces to the evaluation of the character of the matrix u 
r (cxkxk1)
in the irreducible representation r of su(n). the character can be given by [12]

[u 

r (cxkxk1)] = tr(eipn 1

= x~mr

=1 h[cxkxk1; a]) =

 ~mr ei ~mr  ~[cxkxk1; a],

(3.1)

where h ( = 1, . . . , n1) are diagonal drdr traceless matrices realizing the representa-
tion of the cartan subalgebra, i.e. [h, h] = 0, of the generators of the su(n) [12]. the
sum runs over all the weights ~mr = (mr 1, . . . , mr n 1) of the irreducible representation r

and  ~mr is the multiplicity of the weight ~mr and p ~mr  ~mr = dr. the components of the
vector ~[cxkxk1; a] are dened by

[cxkxk1; a] = gzcxk xk1

 [(x)],

(3.2)

where we have introduced the notation (x) = taa(x) = dz  a(x). the functions
 [(x)] are proportional to the roots of the equation deth(x)  i = 0.
the path integral representation of wilson loops dened for the irreducible represen-

tation r of su(n) reads

wr(c) =

1
d2

r z yxc

dr(x) x{ ~mr(x)}

dr  ~mr(x) ei g hc ~mr(x)  ~ [(x)].

(3.3)

let us consider in more details the path integral representation of wilson loops dened
for the fundamental representation 3 of su(3). the character 3[u 

3 (c)] is dened as

3[u 

3 (c)] = tr(cid:16)eih11[c; a] + ih22[c; a](cid:17) = ei2[c; a]/3
+ei1[c; a]/23 ei2[c; a]/6 + ei1[c; a]/23 ei2[c; a]/6,

(3.4)
where h1 = t3/3 and h2 = t8/3 [12]. for the representation 3 of su(3) the equation
det[  ] = 0 takes the form

tr 2(x)  det (x) = 0.

4 wilson loop for pure gauge eld

as has been pointed out in ref.[3] the path integral over gauge degrees of freedom repre-
senting wilson loops is not of the feynman type, therefore, it depends explicitly on how
one understands it, i.e. how it is discretized and regularized. we would like to empha-
size that the regularization procedure applied in ref.[3] has led to an expression for wilson
loops which supports the hypothesis of maximal abelian projection [14]. according to
this hypothesis only abelian degrees of freedom of nonabelian gauge elds are respon-
sible for connement. this is to full extent a dynamical hypothesis. it is quite obvious
that such a dynamical hypothesis cannot be derived only by means of a regularization
procedure.

10

in order to show that the problem touched in this paper is not of marginal interest
and to check if path integral expressions that look dierently supercially could actually
compute the same number we evaluate below explicitly the path integrals representing
wilson loop for a pure su(2) gauge eld. as has been stated in ref.[3] for wilson loops
c a gauge eld along a given curve can be always written as a pure gauge and the
derivation of the path integral representation for wilson loops can be provided for the
gauge eld taken without loss of generality in the pure gauge form. we would like to
show that for the pure su(2) gauge eld the path integral representation for wilson loops
suggested in ref.[3] fails for a correct description of wilson loops. since a pure gauge
eld is equivalent to a zero gauge eld wilson loops should be unity.

of course, any correct path integral representation for wilson loops should lead to
the same result. the evaluation of wilson loops within the path integral representation
eq.(2.8) is rather trivial and transparent.
indeed, we have not corrupted the starting
expression for wilson loops (2.1) by any articial regularization. thereby, the general
formula (2.8) evaluated through the discretization given by eqs.(2.7) and (2.6) is com-
pletely identical to the original expression (2.1). the former gives a unit value for wilson
loops dened for an arbitrary contour c and an irreducible representation j of su(2):
wj (c) = 1.

let us focus now on the path integral representation suggested in ref.[3]

wj (c) = z yxc

d(x) e2ijghc dx tr[t3a

 (x)],

(4.1)

where all matrices are taken in the irreducible representation j. following the discretiza-
tion suggested in ref.[3] we arrive at the expression

wj (c) = lim
n

n

yk=1z d(xk) e

2ijgrcxk+1xk

dx tr[t3a

 (x)]

.

setting a(x) = u(x)u (x)/ig we get

a

 (x) =

1
ig

((x)u(x))((x)u(x)).

by a gauge transformation (x)u(x)  (x) we reduce eq.(4.1) to the form

wj (c) = z yxc

d(x) e2j hc dx tr[t3(x)(x)].

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

for simplicity we consider wilson loops in the fundamental representation of su(2),
w1/2(c). the result can be generalized to any irreducible representation j.

for the evaluation of the path integral eq.(4.4) it is convenient to use a standard s
parameterization of wilson loops c [2]: x  x(s), with s  [0, 1] and x(0) = x(1) =
x.

the wilson loop (4.4) reads in the sparameterization

w1/2(c) = z y0s1

for the subsequent integration over k we suggest to use a formula of ref.[15] modied

for our case

z d eztr[t3a + bt3] = xj

j (z)
2j + 1

j[(t3)2ab],

where the coecients aj(z) are dened by the expansion [15]

eztr[t3u] = xj

aj(z) j[t3u].

(4.7)

(4.8)

in the particular case z = 2j and for the fundamental representation j = 1/2 we have
z = 1. the trace tr[t3u] in the exponent of the l.h.s. of eq.(4.8) should be evaluated
for the fundamental representation of su(2). by virtue of the orthogonality relation for
characters [9,10,15]

z du j[au ] j[ub] =

jj

2j + 1

j[ab],

(4.9)

where du is the haar measure for the su(2) group, the coecients aj(z) for j 6= 0 can
be determined by [15]

aj(z) =

3

j(j + 1) z du j[t3u ] eztr[t3u].

(4.10)

we have used here that j[(t3)2] = j(j + 1)(2j + 1)/3. the coecient a0(z) is dened by

a0(z) = z du eztr[t3u].

(4.11)

the coecients aj(z) obey a completeness condition. for its derivation we notice that
tr[t3u ] = tr[t3u] which can be easily seen from the standard parameterization of the
matrix u in terms of an angle  and a unit vector ~n (see eq.(3.96) of ref.[10])

u = e+i ~n  ~ /2 = cos
u  = ei ~n  ~ /2 = cos

the expansion of eztr[t3u ] we represent as follows

eztr[t3u ] = xj

bj(z) j[t3u ].

12

(4.12)

(4.13)

let us show that bj(z) = aj(z). using the orthogonality relation (4.9) we obtain

bj(z) =

3

j(j + 1) z du j[t3u] eztr[t3u ], j 6= 0,

b0(z) = z du eztr[t3u ].

(4.14)

then, making the change u   u we get bj(z) = aj(z) by virtue of the invariance of the
haar measure du  = du.
thus, taking the product of the expansions (4.8) and (4.13) with bj(z) = aj(z) and

integrating over u we get

z du eztr[t3u] eztr[t3u ] = xj xj
= xj
0(z) +xj>0

j(j + 1) a2

j (z).

(4.15)

the l.h.s. of eq.(4.15) is equal to unity due to the relation tr[t3u ] = tr[t3u] and the
normalization of the haar measure r du = 1. therefore, the completeness condition for
the coecients aj(z) reads

a2

0(z) +xj>0

j(j + 1) a2

j (z) = 1.

(4.16)

the coecient a0(z) we evaluate below. the evaluation of coecients aj(z) for an arbi-
trary j is given in the appendix. for the evaluation of a0(z) one can use, for example,
the standard parameterization (4.12) and the denition of the haar measure du (see
eq.(3.97) of ref.[10])

du =

1

42 d~n d sin2 

2

,

(4.17)

where d~n is the uniform measure on the unit sphere s2 [9]. as a result for a0(z) we
obtain

a0(z) = z du eztr[t3u] = 2j1(z)/z,

(4.18)

where j1(z) is a bessel function [16]. in the particular case, z = 1, we get a0(1) = a0 =
2j1(1) = 0.88 [16].

for the integration over k we suppose, rst, that n is an even number. then, inte-

grating over n1, n3,. . ., 1 we obtain

given by eq.(4.18).

0 = 0 by virtue of the relation a0 = 2j1(1) = 0.88 < 1

the expression (4.20) is valid too if n is an odd number. however,

in this case

j[(t3)n] = 0 and we get immediately w1/2(c) = 0.

in order to estimate j[(t3)n] for n an even number and at n   we suggest to apply

the following procedure

this proves that the wilson loop w1/2(c) vanishes in the limit n  , w1/2(c) = 0.
thus, the wilson loop w1/2(c) for an arbitrary contour c and a pure gauge eld
represented by the path integral derived in ref.[3] vanishes, instead of being equal to
unity, w1/2(c) = 1. this shows that the path integral representation suggested in ref.[3]
fails for the correct description of wilson loops.

5 wilson loop for z(2) center vortices

in this section we evaluate explicitly the path integral (4.1) for wilson loops pierced by
a z(2) center vortex with spatial azimuthal symmetry. some problems of z(2) center
vortices with spatial azimuthal symmetry have been analysed by diakonov in his recent
publication [17] for the gauge group su(2). in this system the main dynamical variable
is the azimuthal component of the nonabelian gauge eld aa
() (a = 1, 2, 3) depending
only on , the radius in the transversal plane. for a circular wilson loop in the irreducible
representation j one gets

wj () =

where () = qaa

(). the gauge coupling constant g is included in the denition
of the gauge eld. for wilson loops in the fundamental representation j = 1/2 we have

()aa

w1/2() = cos[()].

(5.2)

in the case of z(2) center vortices with spatial azimuthal symmetry and for the funda-
mental representation of su(2) eq.(4.2) takes the form

for the subsequent evaluation it is convenient to introduce the matrix

 a()(cid:17).

in terms of q(a) the path integral (5.3) reads

the integration over n we have carried out by means of eq.(2.3). one can easily
show that eq.(5.8) is also valid for odd n, as well as eq.(4.12). in this case due to the
relation j[(t3)n] = 0 we obtain again w1/2() = 0.

for even n we should use the relation j[(t3)n]  jn at n   which follows from

eq.(4.13). this reduces the r.h.s. of eq.(5.7) to the form

due to the constraint eq.(4.23) the wilson loop vanishes in the limit n  , w1/2() = 0.
thus, we have shown that the the path integral for wilson loops suggested in ref.[3] gives
zero for a eld conguration with a z(2) center vortex, w1/2() = 0, instead of the correct
result w1/2() = cos (), eq.(5.2).

we hope that the examples considered in sect.4 and 5 demonstrate that the path
integral representation for wilson loops derived in ref.[3] is erroneous. nevertheless, in
sect. 6 we evaluate explicitly the regularized evolution operator zreg(r2, r1) suggested by
diakonov and petrov for the representation of the wilson loop in ref.[3]. we show that
this regularized evolution operator zreg(r2, r1) has been evaluated incorrectly in ref.[3].
the correct evaluation gives zreg(r2, r1) = 0 which agrees with our results obtained
above.

6 path integral for the evolution operator z(r2, r1)

as has been suggested in ref.[3] the functional z(r2, r1) dened by (see eq.(8) of ref.[3])

z(r2, r1) =

dr(t) exp it

t2

zt1

tr (ir r 3)!,

(6.1)

where r = dr/dt and t = 1/2, 1, 3/2, . . . is the colour isospin quantum number, should
be regularized by the analogy to an axialsymmetric top. the regularized expression has
been dened in eq.(9) of ref.[3] by

zreg(r2, r1) =

where a = i tr(r r a) are angular velocities of the top, a are pauli matrices a = 1, 2, 3,
i and ik are the moments of inertia of the top which should be taken to zero. according
to the prescription of ref.[3] one should take rst the limit ik  0 and then i  0.

for the conrmation of the result, given in eq.(13) of ref.[3],

zreg(r2, r1) = (2t + 1) dt

t t (r2r

1),

(6.3)

where dt (u) is a wigner rotational matrix in the representation t , the authors of ref.[3]
suggested to evaluate the evolution operator (6.2) explicitly by means of the discretization
of the path integral over r. the discretized form of the evolution operator eq.(6.2) is
given by eq.(14) of ref.[3] and reads1

n+1a)/ is the discretized analogy

(6.5)

(see eq.(19) of ref.[3]). according to the prescription of ref.[3] one should take the limits
  0 and ik, i  0 but keeping the ratios ii/, where (i = k,), much greater than
unity, ii/  1.

let us rewrite the exponent of the integrand of eq.(6.4) in equivalent form

now let us show that if vn is a rotation in the fundamental representation of su(2), so

for this aim, rst, recall that

(tr vna)2 = 4 + (tr vn)2.

tr (vna) = tr (v 

n a).

(6.7)

(6.8)

since vn is a rotation matrix in the fundamental representation of su(2), it can be taken
in the general standard parameterization given by eq.(4.12). by virtue of the relation
(6.8) we can rewrite (tr vna)2 as follows

(tr vna)2 = tr (vna)tr (v

due to the assumption ii/  1, where (i = k,), the integrals over rn are concentrated

where we have replaced (n + 1)  = t2  t1 = t. the obtained result is exact. by
replacing ik  m, n +1  xb, 0  xa and t  (tb  ta) we arrive at the expression
for the green function, the evolution operator, of a free particle with a mass m given by
eq.(2.51) of ref.[6].

thus, after the integration over n the evolution operator zreg(rn +1, r0) can be

formally we do not need to evaluate the functional f [i, n +1, 0] explicitly.
in fact,
the functional f [i, n +1, 0] should be a regular function of variables i, n +1 and 0
restricted in the limit i  0. therefore, taking the limit ik  0 for the evolution
operator zreg(rn +1, r0) dened by eq.(6.21) we get

z(r2, r1) = lim

ik,i0

zreg(rn +1, r0) = 0.

(6.23)

this agrees with our results obtained in sects. 4 and 5.

21

nevertheless, in spite of this very denite result let us proceed to the explicit evaluation
of the functional f [i, n +1, 0]. it is convenient to rewrite the integrand of eq.(6.22) in
the equivalent form

vanishes in the limit n   since the euler angles n +1 and 0 are small compared with
unity due to the constraint i/  1 [3]. the vanishing of the functional f [i, n +1, 0]
in the limit n   agrees with our results obtained in sects. 4 and 5.

substituting eq.(6.35) in eq.(6.21) we obtain

zreg(rn +1, r0) = 0.

(6.36)

25

this leads to the vanishing of the evolution operator z(r2, r1) given by eq.(6.1) or eq.(8)
of ref.[3], z(r2, r1) = 0.

thus, the evolution operator z(r2, r1) suggested in ref.[3] for the description of
wilson loops in terms of path integrals over gauge degrees of freedom is equal to zero
identically. this agrees with our results obtained in sects. 4 and 5. as we have shown the
vanishing of z(r2, r1) does not depend on the specic regularization and discretization
of the path integral. in fact, this is an intrinsic property of the path integral given by
eq.(6.1) that becomes obvious if the evaluation is carried out correctly.

7 evolution operator z(r2, r1) and shift of energy

levels of an axialsymmetric top

in this section we criticize the analysis of the evolution operator z(r2, r1) carried out
by diakonov and petrov via the canonical quantization of the axialsymmetric top (see
eq.(12) of ref.[3]). below we use the notations of ref.[3].

the parallel transport operator

w(t2, t1) = "p exp i

x(t2)

zx(t1)

aa

(x) t a dx!#

= "p exp i

t2

zt1

a(t) dt!#

,

(7.1)

where a(t) = aa
(x) t a dx/dt is a tangent component of the yangmills eld and t a (a =
1, 2, 3) are the generators of su(2) group in the representation t , has been reduced to
the form

w(t2, t1) = dt

(u(t2)u (t1)),

(7.2)

(see eq.(5) of ref.[3]) due to the statement [3]: the potential a(t) along a given curve
can be always written as a pure gauge

a(t) = i dt

(u(t))

d
dt

dt

(u (t))

(7.3)

(see eq.(4) of ref.[3]).

by using the parallel transport operator eq.(7.2) the wilson loop wt (c) in the rep-

resentation t has been dened by

wt (c) = x

w(t2, t1) = x

dt

(u(t2)u (t1)).

(7.4)

(see eq.(25) of ref.[3]). in terms of the evolution operator z(r2, r1) given by eq.(6.1)
(see eq.(8) of ref.[3]) the parallel transport operator w(t2, t1) has been recast into the
form

w dp

 (t2, t1) = zz dr1 dr2 xt ,m

(2t  + 1) dt 

m(u(t2)r

2)dt 

m(r1u (t1)) z(r2, r1), (7.5)

where the index dp means that the parallel transport operator is taken in the diakonov
petrov (dp) representation. the wilson loop w dp

t (c) in the dprepresentation reads

w dp

t (c) = zz dr1 dr2 xt ,m,

(2t  + 1) dt 

m(u(t2)r

2)dt 

m(r1u (t1)) z(r2, r1).

(7.6)

26

of course, if the dprepresentation were correct we should get w dp
wt (c) is determined by eq.(7.4).

t (c) = wt (c), where

the regularized evolution operator zreg(r2, r1) given by eq.(6.3) (see also eq.(9) of
ref.[3]) can be represented in the form of a sum over possible intermediate states, i.e.
eigenfunctions of the axialsymmetric top

zreg(r2, r1) = xj,m,k

(2j + 1) dj

mk(r2)dj

km(r

1) ei(t2  t1) ejm,

(7.7)

(see eq.(12) of ref.[3]), where ejm are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of the axial
symmetric top

ejm =

j(j + 1)  m2

2i

+

(m  t )2

2ik

(7.8)

(see eq.(11) of ref.[3]).

as has been stated in ref.[3]: if we now take to zero i,k  0 (rst ik, then i)
we see that in the sum (12) only the lowest energy intermediate state survives with m =
j = t . the resulting phase factor from the lowest energy state can be absorbed in the
normalization factor in eq.(9) since that corresponds to a shift in the energy scale.

the statement concerning the possibility to absorb the uctuating factor exp[i(t2 
t1) t /2i] in the normalization of the path integral representing the evolution operator
is the main one allowing the r.h.s. of eqs.(7.5) and (7.6) to escape from the vanishing in
the limit i  0.
in reality such a removal of the uctuating factor is prohibited since this leads to
the change of the starting symmetry of the system from su(2) to u(2).
in order to
make this more transparent we suggest to insert zreg(r2, r1) of eq.(7.7) into eq.(7.6)
and to express the wilson loop w dp
t (c) in terms of a sum over possible intermediate
states, the eigenfunctions of the axialsymmetric top. the main idea of this substitution
is the following: as the wilson loop is a physical quantity which can be measured, all
irrelevant normalization factors should be canceled for the evaluation of it. therefore, if
the oscillating factor exp[ i (t2  t1) t /2i] can be really removed by a renormalization
of something, the wilson loop should not depend on this factor.
substituting eq.(7.7) in eq.(7.6) and integrating over r1 and r2 we obtain the fol-

lowing expansion for the parallel transport operator in the dprepresentation

w dp

 (t2, t1) = xt 

t 

xm=t 

(u(t2)u (t1)) ei(t2  t1) et m.

due to the denition (7.4) the r.h.s. of eq.(7.10) can be rewritten in the form

t (c) = x

w dp

 (t2, t1) = xt 

xm=t 

t 

wt (c) ei(t2  t1) et m,

(7.11)

27

where wt (c) is the wilson loop in the t  representation determined by eq.(7.4). the
relation (7.11) agrees to some extent with our expansion given by eq.(7.1).

following ref.[3] and taking the limit ik  0 we obtain m = t . this reduces the

r.h.s. of eq.(7.11) to the form

w dp

t (c) = xt 

wt (c) exp"  i(t2  t1)

now according to the prescription of ref.[3] we should take the limit i  0. following

thus, wilson loops in the dprepresentation dier from original wilson loops by the
oscillating factor exp[i(t2  t1) t /2i]. the only possibility to remove the oscillating
factor exp[i(t2  t1) t /2i] is to absorb this phase factors in the matrices u(t2) and
u (t1) which describe the degrees of freedom of the gauge potential a(t) via the relation
(7.2). this yields the changes

u(t2)  u (t2) = u(t2) ei t2 t /2i,
u (t1)  u (t1) = u (t1) e i t1 t /2i.

(7.14)

however, the matrices u (t2) and u (t1) are now the elements of the u(2) group but not
of su(2). thus, the shift of the energy level of the ground state of the axialsymmetric
top suggested by diakonov and petrov in order to remove the oscillating factor changes
crucially the starting symmetry of the theory from su(2) to u(2). since the former is
not allowed the oscillating factor exp[i(t2  t1) t /2i] cannot be removed. as a result
in the limit i  0 we obtain

w dp

t (c) = 0.

(7.15)

the vanishing of wilson loops in the dprepresentation agrees with our results obtained
in sects. 4, 5 and 6 and conrms our claim that this path integral representation of wilson
loops is incorrect.

8 the nonabelian stokes theorem

the derivation of the arealaw fallo promoted great interests in the nonabelian stokes
theorem expressing the exponent of wilson loops in terms of a surface integral over the
2dimensional surface s with the boundary c = s [19]

trpcei g hc dx a(x) = trps e

i g 1

2 rrs

d(y) u(cxy) g(y) u(cyx)

,

(8.1)

28

where ps is the surface ordering operator [19], d(y) is a 2dimensional surface element
in 4dimensional spacetime, x is a current point on the contour c, i.e. x  c, y is a
point on the surface s, i.e. y  s, and g(y) = a(y)  a(y)  ig[a(y), a(y)]
is the eld strength tensor. the procedure for the derivation of the nonabelian stokes
theorem in the form of eq.(8.1) contains a summation of contributions of closed paths
around innitesimal areas and these paths are linked to the reference point x on the
contour c via parallel transport operators. the existence of closed paths linked to the
references point x on the contour c is a necessary and a sucient condition for the
derivation of the nonabelian stokes theorem eq.(8.1).

due to the absence of closed paths it is rather clear that the path integral represen-
tation for wilson loops cannot be applied to the derivation of the nonabelian stokes
theorem. in fact, the evaluation of the path integral over gauge degrees of freedom de-
mands the decomposition of the closed contour c into a set of innitesimal segments
which can be never closed. let us prove this statement by assuming the converse. sup-
pose that by representing the path integral over gauge degrees of freedom in the form of
the ndimensional integral (2.7) we have a closed segment. let the segment cxkxk1 be
closed and the point x belong to the segment cxkxk1, x  cxkxk1. by using eq.(2.2)
we can represent the character [u 

r (cxkxk1)] by

r (cxkxk1)] = [u 

[u 
= [(xi)ur(cxix)ur(cxxi1)(xi1)] =

r (cxix)u 

r (cxxi1)] =

= drz dr(x)[r(xi)ur(cxix)
= drz dr(x)[u 
r (cxix)] [u 

r (cxxi1)].

r(x)] [r(x)ur(cxxi1)(xi1)] =

(8.2)

this transforms a (n  1)dimensional integral with one closed innitesimal segment
into a ndimensional integral without closed segments. since nally n tends to innity
there is no closed segments for the representation for the path integral in the form of a
(n  1)dimensional integral. as this statement is general and valid for any path integral
representation of wilson loops, so one can conclude that no further nonabelian stokes
theorem can be derived within any path integral approach to wilson loops.

9 conclusion

by using well dened properties of group characters we have shown that the path integral
over gauge degrees of freedom of the wilson loop which was used in eq.(2.13) of ref.[11]
for a lattice evaluation of the average value of wilson loops can be derived in continuum
spacetime in nonabelian gauge theories with the gauge group su(n). the resultant
integrand of the path integral contains a phase factor which is not projected onto abelian
degrees of freedom of nonabelian gauge elds and diers substantially from the repre-
sentation given in ref.[3]. the important point of our representation is the summation
over all states of the given irreducible representation r of su(n). for example, in su(2)
the phase factor is summed over all values of the colourmagnetic quantum number mj
of the irreducible representation j of colour charges. this contradicts eq.(23) of ref.[3],
where only term with the highest value of the colourmagnetic quantum number mj = j

29

are taken into account and the other 2j terms are lost. this loss is caused by an arti-
cial regularization procedure applied in ref.[3] for the denition of the path integral over
gauge degrees of freedom.

as has been stated by diakonov and petrov in ref.[3] the path integral over gauge
degrees of freedom representing wilson loops is not of the feynman type, therefore, it
depends explicitly on how one understands it, i.e. how it is discretized and regularized.
in order to understand the path integral over gauge degrees of freedom diakonov and
petrov [3] suggested a regularization procedure drawing an analogy between gauge degrees
of freedom and dynamical variables of the axialsymmetric top with moments of inertia
i and ik. the nal expression for the path integral of the wilson loop has been obtained
in the limit i, ik  0.
in order to make the incorrectness of this expression more transparent we have eval-
uated the path integral for specic gauge eld congurations (i) a pure gauge eld and
(ii) z(2) center vortices with spatial azimuthal symmetry. the direct evaluation of path
integrals representing wilson loops for these gauge eld congurations has given the value
zero for both cases. these results do not agree with the correct values.

one can show that eq.(5.11) can be generalized for any contour of a wilson loop in

su(2)

w1/2(c) = z yxc

d(x) eighc dx tr[t3a

 (x)] =

= lim

nxj>0" jaj

2j + 1#n

(2j + 1)wj(c) = 0,

(9.1)

where wj(c) in the r.h.s. is dened by eq.(2.1) in terms of the pathordering operator
pc. further, the result (9.1) can be extended to any irreducible representation of su(2).
thus, we argue that the path integral suggested in ref.[3] to represent wilson loops is
identically zero for wilson loops independent on the gauge eld conguration, the shape
of the contour c and the irreducible representation of su(2).

this statement we have supported by a direct evaluation of the evolution operator
zreg(r2, r1) dened by eq.(14) of ref.[3], representing the assumption by diakonov and
petrov for wilson loops in terms of the path integral over gauge degrees of freedom. as we
have shown in sect. 6 the regularized evolution operator zreg(r2, r1), evaluated correctly,
is equal to zero. this agrees with our results obtained in sects. 4 and 5. in sect. 7 we have
shown that the removal of the oscillating factor from the evolution operator suggested in
ref.[3] via a shift of energy levels of the axialsymmetric top is prohibited. such a shift
of energy levels leads to a change of the starting symmetry of the system from su(2) to
u(2). by virtue of the oscillating factor the wilson loop vanishes in the limit ik, i  0
in agreement with our results in sects. 4, 5 and 6.
we hope that the considerations in sects. 47 are more than enough to persuade even
the most distrustful reader that the path integral representation for the wilson derived
by diakonov and petrov by means of special regularization and understanding of the path
integral over gauge degrees of freedom is erroneous.

the use of an erroneous path integral representation for wilson loops in ref.[7] has
led to the conclusion that for large distances the average value of wilson loops shows
arealaw fallo for any irreducible representation r of su(n). unfortunately, this result

30

is not supported by numerical simulations of lattice qcd [8]. at large distances, colour
charges with nonzero nality have string tensions of the corresponding fundamental
representation, whereas colour charges with zero nality are screened by gluons and
cannot form a string. therefore, the result obtained in ref.[7] cannot be considered as
a new check of connement in lattice calculations as has been argued by the authors of
ref.[7].

we would like to accentuate that the problem we have touched in this paper is not of
marginal interest and a path integral, if derived by means of an unjustied regularization
procedure, would hardly compute the same physical number as the correct one. we argue
that no regularization procedure can lead to specic dynamical constraints. in fact, the
regularization procedure drawing the analogy with the axialsymmetric top has led to
the result supporting the hypothesis of maximal abelian projection pointed out by t
hooft [14]. any proof of this to full extent dynamical hypothesis through a regularization
procedure and through specic understanding of the path integral should have seemed
dubious and suspicious.

finally, we have shown that within any path integral representation for wilson loops in
terms of gauge degrees of freedom no nonabelian stokes theorem in addition to eq.(8.1)
can be derived. indeed, the stokes theorem replaces a line integral over a closed contour
by a surface integral with the closed contour as the boundary of a surface. however,
approximating the path integral by an ndimensional integral at n   there are no
closed paths linking two adjacent points along wilson loops. thereby, the line integrals
over these open paths cannot be replaced by surface integrals. thus, we argue that any
non-abelian stokes theorem can be derived only within the denition of wilson loops
through the path ordering procedure (8.1). of course, one can represent the surface
ordering operator ps in eq.(8.1) in terms of a path integral over gauge degrees of freedom,
but this should not be a new nonabelian stokes theorem in comparison with the old
one given by eq.(8.1). that is why the claims of ref.[35] concerning new versions of
the nonabelian stokes theorems derived within path integral representations for wilson
loops seem unjustied.

discussions with jan thomassen are appreciated.

appendix. coecients aj(z)

in this appendix we evaluate the coecients aj(z) of the expansion (4.8) and show that
the completeness condition given by the series (4.16) converges to unity.

it is convenient to rewrite eq.(4.8) as follows

ez1/2[t3u] = xj

aj(z) j[t3u] = a0(z) + a1/2(z) 1/2[t3u]

+a1(z) 1[t3u] + a3/2(z) 3/2[t3u] + a2(z) 2[t3u] + a5/2(z) 5/2[t3u] + . . .

for the evaluation of the coecients a0(z), a1/2(z), a1(z), a3/2(z), a2(z) and a5/2(z) we
would make use the parameterization of the matrices u in terms of the euler angles , 
and  ranging over the regions 0    2, 0     and 0    2, respectively [18].
