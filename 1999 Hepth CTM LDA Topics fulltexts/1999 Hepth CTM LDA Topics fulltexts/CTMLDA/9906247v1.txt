abstract

three-string junctions are allowed congurations in ii b string theory which

preserve one-fourth supersymmetry. we obtain the 11-dimensional supergravity

solution for curved membranes corresponding to these three-string junctions.

in the last few years, there has been lot of interest on three-string junctions in type ii
b string theory [1]- [7]. it was orginally postulated by schwarz that string theory can also
admit multi-junction/multi-pronged strings as fundamental objects [1]. in ref. [2], it has
been shown that the gauge eld congurations in f -theory on k3 for exceptional groups
can be accounted only if multi-pronged strings besides the usual strings (two-pronged)
are included as solutions in string theory. the one-fourth bps nature of three-string
junction was conjectured in [1] and proven in [3, 4]. these three-pronged strings/three-
string junction connecting three d3-branes gives understanding of 1
4-th bps states of the
su(3) super yang-mills theory on the coincident three- d3-branes[5, 6] and their su(n)
generalisations presented in ref. [7].

with enough evidence for such a junction conguration to be present in string theory,
it is very essential that these junctions emerge as exact solution of supergravity eld

equations. till date, attempts in 10-dimensions have failed due to the singular nature
at the junction. the hope is that smoothening the junction would help in nding the
solution. hence, we look at curved membranes in m-theory corresponding to three-string
junctions in ii b theory. the supergravity solution for planar membranes corresponding
to fundamental strings [8] gives us some idea in solving the curved case. the solutions
obtained after the forthcoming (tedious) calculations are given in eqns.(65, 66).

the two dimensional membrane corresponding to three-string junction is given by

holomorphic curve [9]:

f (u, v) = 0 ,

(1)

where u and v represents complex coordinate in r2  t 2.

we begin by making an ansatz for the 11-dimensional metric gm n respecting so(6)

symmetry and gauge elds am n p ( m, n, p = 0, 1, . . . 10)

ds2 = a0(u, u, v, v, r)dt2 + 2a1(u, u, v, v, r)|du|2 + 2a2(u, u, v, v, r)|dv|2

where the indices with hat refers to tangent space index distinguishing them from world

to fewer number of unknowns by requiring that the eld conguration (2, 3) preserve

one-fourth supersymmetry. in other words, there must exist killing spinors satisfying

dm  = 0

transformation,

m = dm ,

and s with world volume index can be converted to tangent space index using vielbeins.
we will split the 11-dimensional  matrix respecting s0(6) symmetry in the following

way:

where   and a are the d = 5 and d = 6 dirac matrices and

 a = (i   7, 1  a)

satisfying the following properties:

7 = 56 . . .  10 .

0uuvv = i ; 2

7 = 1

(10)

(11)

(12)

to simplify the computations, we shall rst impose the following constraints on 

u = 0 ; v = 0 ; 7 = i ,

(13)

which in the 11-dimensions gives one-fourth bps nature of the curved membranes corre-
sponding to three-string junction-viz.,

125 . . . 10 =  ,

345 . . . 10 =  .

where 0 is a constant and h1(r), h2(r) are harmonic functions. clearly, the metric for
the intersecting 2-branes is independent of the normal coordinates to one of the branes but
tangential to the other brane (u, v). these solutions are meaningful only if u, v coordinates
are compact with the charges being spread over the branes.

where the hodge star operation  is done on the r2  t 2 space (u, v plane). the three-

this restricted class includes holomorphic curves f = pu + qv representing planar mem-
branes corresponding to (p, q) strings in iib theory. the membrane solution for f = u
and f = v agrees with the results in ref.[8].

the above two solutions are expected and they conrm the correctness of the eqns.(32-

51) obtained as a consequence of one-fourth supersymmetry.

3) arbitrary curved membranes including those corresponding to three-string junction

similar to m2  m2 intersecting branes, we have a solution with an 1
r4 dependence
implying that the the charge is spread over the plane of the junction. this makes sense
only if the junction plane is compact and the junction is a lattice. thus the supergravity
solution which we have found for curved membranes corresponds to a general network of
strings and not just a junction.

it looks plausible to generalise the procedure to construct supergravity solution for
other non-planar networks [11, 12] and also for curved m5-brane solution corresponding
to intersecting ns5-brane and d4-brane in iia theory [13]. the challenging problem of
nding localised solutions, corresponding to junction plane being innite, still remains.
