abstract

we investigate the anomalous creation of fundamental strings using the bound-
ary state formalism of fractional d-branes on ale spaces in the orbifold limit. the
open string witten index plays a crucial role in this calculation and so the result
remains unchanged even if we blow up the orbifold geometrically, matching the
anomaly inow argument.

further we consider the quiver gauge theories on such fractional d3-branes and
see that the string creation mechanism determines 1-loop logarithmic monodromy
of these gauge theories. also we comment on the relation of d(-1)-d3 amplitude to
the 1-loop beta function.

1 introduction

since the discovery of d-branes[1], nonperturbative aspects of superstring theory have
been intensively investigated and the tremendous progress has been made.

usually, a d-brane is dened as a solitonic object to which open strings attach. but
there is another equivalent description from the viewpoint of closed strings and it is
called the boundary state [12]. the correspondence between these two descriptions which
is called the cardys condition [13] gives a very crucial consistency condition if one would
verify the existence of some complicated d-branes such as non-bps d-branes discussed
in [23] and d-branes in orbifold models or gepner models discussed in [7][8][10][9].

another situation where the boundary state description of d-branes plays an impor-
tant role is the investigation of string creation mechanism as already discussed in the case
of at space [16].

in this paper we discuss the string creation phenomenon in the case of the orbifold
limit of ale spaces and show that the witten index of ale space part of the open string
cft plays crucial role. so the result will not change if we blow up the orbifold. further
we derive the 1-loop monodromy of the quiver gauge theory on d-branes at an orbifold
singularity.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we review the description of fractional
d-branes on the orbifold limit of ale spaces and some mathematical facts. in section 3,
we explain already known boundary state formalism of orbifold theory and give complete
proof that this is indeed the case.
in section 4, we calculate the open string witten
index by using boundary state formalism. in section 5, we investigate the string creation
phenomenon of d-branes on ale spaces from the viewpoint of both the cft calculation
and anomaly inow. in section 6, we consider the quiver gauge theories on d-branes and
show 1-loop monodromies are equivalent to the string creation phenomenon. in section 7,
we summarize the conclusions and comment on future directions. in the appendix a, we
give a explicit construction of boundary states of fractional d-branes at an 1 singularity.

2 fractional d-branes at orbifold singularities

here we summarize the description of the fractional d-branes at the orbifold c2/ sin-
gularities [2][3]. we concentrate on the orbifold limit of ale spaces in this and the next
section. but as we will see later, the main parts of the results of this paper remain correct
if we blow up the orbifold.

the orbifold singularities c2/ are classied by the discrete group  falling into
a, d, e series. irreducible representations of  are nite dimensional (in particular one
dimensional for a series) and we write them as {i} (1  i  r) ,where we dene r as
the number of irreducible representations.
explicit -actions on c2 whose coordinates are written as (z1, z2) are given in [2][3]

and for an type ( = zn+1) they are as follows

 = {1, g,  , gn} (gn +1 = 1)

2

g : z1  e

2i

n+1 z1 , z2  e 2i

n+1 z2.

(2.1)

this two dimensional representation is fundamental and is called as the natural rep-

resentation nat.

the geometric meaning of c2/-singularities is that some 2-cycles vanish at the origin
and if we blow up those singularities we can dene their intersection numbers c for 2-
cycle [] and []. the following two mathematical facts are very useful.

 there is a one-to-one correspondence between homology 2-cycles and the irreducible
=1a
it should also be mentioned that 2-cycles
 [] 

representations :[]  . further in the decomposition   nat = r
we can identify c = 2 + a .
{[]} (1    r) are not all independent and follow the relation : pr
=1 n(0)
0, where we set n(0)
 2 + a(= c) are equal to the cartan matrices of the corresponding extended
lie algebras :  = { an , dn , e6, e7, e8}. this highly nontrivial relation between
the irreducible representations of  and extended lie algebras is called as mckay
correspondence[21].

 = dim() .

physical models at c2/-singularities are obtained from the conventional orbifold
method and further we can consider d-branes in this theory. the orbifold cfts are not
really singular because there are twisted nsns-b elds[4] on each of 2-cycles and wrapped
strings and d-branes become massive. the explicit values of b-elds are given[5][17] as

bn s = 2

n(0)

n

z[]

(n(0)

 = dim()).

(2.2)

a dp-brane systems on c2/ space are classied by the representations of  action
on their chan-paton factors  and we describe them as  = r
=1n. a dp-brane
corresponding to  is called a (-type) fractional dp-brane and can be interpreted as
a d(p+2)-brane wrapped on a vanishing 2-cycle [] as discussed in [6]. we can always
decompose a general dp-brane system into fractional dp-branes.

the spectrums of open strings attached to such a dp-brane system are given as follows
[2]. we dene pg-action on - string, which means the open string stretched between
-type and -type fractional dp-brane as

pg :   (g)(g)1  r(g),

(2.3)

where we dene (g) as the action g   on the chan-paton factor of  representation
and r(g) as the action g   on the oscillator part of the open strings.
if we concentrate on the massless modes, then we get 4d n=2 super yang-mills theory
for p=3 and summarized as a quiver diagram[2]. its gauge groups are qr
=1 u(n) and
hyper multiplets belong to ,a,( n, n) representation. and the geometrical blowing
up modes correspond to fi-terms in this yang-mills theory.
in particular, a bulk d-brane corresponds to the regular representation, which is
 . the 4d n=2 super yang-mills theory on such branes have

dened as reg = n(0)

3

vanishing -function implying superconformal invariance if we ignore each u(1) factor as
discussed in [17].

generally, using dbi-action and wz-terms of d-branes we can identify[17] the complex

gauge coupling of each u(n) part as

 =



2 z[]

bn s +

1

2 z[]

br ,  = ie + ,

(2.4)

where bn s,br means nsns,rr 2-form eld and , means dilaton,axion.

in the case of the regular representation, we get  = n

(0)


n  =const .

3 the boundary states of d-branes at orbifold sin-

gularities

the boundary states of fractional d-branes at general orbifold singularities have already
been constructed in [7], but it seems that no complete proof have been given until now.
so we give the proof here in the case of c2/ orbifold2.

first we dene the character (g) of g-action on the  representation as (g) =

t r (g) .

the boundary states of orbifold theories generally exist for each twisted sector. let

us dene |tg > (g  ) as

2z 

0

dt
2t

t ropen

n sr

1 + (1)f

2

g
||

e2tho =< tg||tg >,

(3.1)

where t r means trace over zero modes and oscillators, and 1+(1)f
and ho correspond to
the gso-projection and the hamiltonian of the open string. and we dened the closed
string propagator  as

2

 = z 

0

dle2lhc 

1
k2 +   ,

(3.2)

where hc means the hamiltonian of the closed string.

note that |tg > is composed of nsns-sector and rr-sector boundary state as |tg >=
|tg >n sn s +|tg >rr and for each p (p=even in iia, p=odd in iib) we can construct
in appendix a we give the explicit forms of |tg > for an -type
corresponding |tg >.
orbifold.
every boundary state can be written as a linear combination of {|tg >} g  
its coecients are determined by the cardys condition[13] which requires that the

.
-projections are well dened in open string sector.

2as is easily seen, generalizations of this proof to other orbifold cases are straightforward.

4

so let us write down the cardys condition in the case of the open string stretched
between fractional dp-branes. let us call the boundary state of a -type fractional d-
brane as |dp() >. the correct -projection for    string is given as follows.

where we dened  = exp( 2i

n +1 ) and we regarded g as the generator of an = zn+1.

now, we can write down |dp() > solving the equation (3.3) as

|dp() >= xg

(g)|tg > .

this boundary state[7] represents a fractional dp-brane which belongs to  represen-

tation and can be interpreted as a d(p+2)-brane wrapped on vanishing []-cycle.

the tension and rr-charges of such a dp-brane are easily obtained from this boundary
state. to see this, we consider a bulk d-brane which belongs to the regular representation.
the corresponding boundary state is

witten index will not change.

following [10][11], let us dene the open string witten index : tr (1)f as

5 string creation from d-branes on ale spaces

5.1 cft calculations

here we investigate d2-d6 system each wrapped on the 2-cycle of ale spaces and show
the anomalous creation of string in that system. in our orbifold description such a system
is regarded as fractional d0-d4 system.

6

first let us calculate the amplitudes of d0  d4 and d0  d4 string. d0 means
anti d0-brane and its boundary state has an extra minus sign in front of the rr-sector
boundary state. we assume that a fractional d0 or d0-brane is -type and a fractional
d4-brane is -type.

then we get

where we choose , + sign for d0-brane, d0-brane,respectively and superscript  means
the elimination of bosonic zero modes. v1 means the volume of d0-brane and y is the
distance between d0 and d4.

from these amplitudes we can read o the potential energy v of d0-d4 system.
naively, one may expect that v should vanish because of supersymmmetry in this system.
to see unbroken supersymmetries, let us dene by (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4) the world volume
of d4-brane and by (x6, x7, x8, x9) the ale space. further we write -matrices and a
linear combination of super-charges as {} and lql + rqr . then the unbroken
supersymmetries are given as

d4 :
d0, d0 :
ale :

l = 01234r
l = 0r
l = 6789l , r = 6789r.

(5.2)

so we get unbroken 1
but explicit cft calculation of (5.1) shows that such an expectation is partly wrong

(5.3)

in this calculation we have used the fact t rn s (1)f = 0 (because of fermionic zero

7

further, we argue

v (d0  d4) = 0.

(5.4)

(5.4) can be easily veried in the lowest order and will be correct due to the supersym-
metry.

so we get

v ( d0  d4) = f 1c y

(5.5)
and this implies that d0  d4 system is not supersymmetric. this situation is very
similar to that of d0  d8 system discussed in [16] and the string creation phenomenon
is expected. indeed if we interpret d0  d4 system as the rotated d0-d4 system by  in
the plane spanned by the direction of d0-brane and the transverse direction x5 , then the
energy dierence (5.3) shows that c fundamental strings are created when a d0-brane
of -type crosses a d4-brane of -type3.this result will be the same if we t-dualize d0-d4
system into dp-d(4-p) system.

it is important to note that in this calculation the open string witten index is crucial
and if we blow up the orbifold into various ale spaces or more globally k3 surfaces, the
result will not change. so we get the following conclusion taking the t-duality equivalence
into consideration.

when a dp-brane wrapped on a 2-cycle [] crosses a d(8-p)-brane wrapped on a 2-
cycle [], c fundamental strings are created, where c is the intersection number of
[] and [].

5.2 anomaly inow argument

generally, string creation can also be investigated by using anomaly inow argument
developed in [15]. anomalous creation of strings occurs if there are chiral fermions in the
d-brane system such as d5  d5 (d5  d5 =1-brane) in at space, which is equivalent
by t-duality to d0  d8 system.
let us apply this method to our case : d2-brane wrapped on [] cycle and d6-brane
wrapped on [] cycle. first we t-dualize this d2-d6 system into d3-d5 system, then
chiral fermions in t-dualized d3-d5 system are generated from the intersection of d-
branes and the number of chiral fermions is c including the sign of the orientation. so
we get the following anomaly equation.

n = crz dt (

da5

(d3)

dt 

da5
(d5)
dt

)

(t = x0),

(5.6)

where we have compactied x5 direction (radius=r) and ad3, ad5 means the gauge eld
on the d3,d5-brane.

3if c < 0, then it means that the string disappears.

8

next we take t-dual in the x5 direction again and we get

c

n =

2r z dt
where the radius of x5 direction is r = 
d6.

d(x5)

dt

(t = x0),

(5.7)

r and x5 means the distance between d2 and

this result is the same as that obtained in previous subsection by explicit cft cal-
culation. it will be important to note that the resolution by b-eld is equivalent to the
geometric resolution in the string creation phenomenon as the comparison between these
two methods shows.

6 1-loop monodromy of quiver gauge theories

6.1 string creation and monodromy

here we consider fractional coincident d3-branes on the orbifold limit of ale spaces in
typeiib string theory. we call the number of each type of fractional d3-branes as {n}.
the quiver gauge theory on that system becomes n=2 super yang-mills theory and so
we consider 1-loop -functions for each gauge group u(n). we dene the complex gauge
couplings as

 = i

4
g2


+


2

.

(6.1)

remember that these gauge couplings are identied as the typeiib background given in
(2.4).

we assume d3-brane world volume and 4d orbifold space extends in the direction
of (x0, x1, x2, x3) and (x6, x7, x8, x9). the remaining (x4, x5)-plane will play the role of
u-plane or moduli space of the coulomb branch.

now let us apply the string creation mechanism discussed in previous section to d1-d3
system, where a fractional d1-brane stretches in the direction of (x0, x4). if a d1-brane of
=1 cn fundamental strings are created.
this means the following monodromy for each  around (x4, x5) = (0, 0), where the

-type crosses the d3-brane system, then pr

d3-branes are coincident

this result agrees with that of [18], where the large n limit of the same system is
treated by using ads/cft correspondence. and it also matches the 1-loop -function

where we have used the identication of z as the energy scale for u(n) gauge theory.

the justication of ignoring each u(1) factor will be the same as that discussed in [19],
which is t-dual to our setup on an series ale spaces. in other words, the geometrical
resolution of the orbifold breaks each u(1) gauge by the existence of fi-terms.

6.2

1-loop -function from d(-1)-d3 amplitude

another way to see these 1-loop monodromies is to calculate the interaction between
a fractional d(-1)-brane and the d3-brane system. this amplitude corresponds to the
leading correction to the action of a d(-1)-brane in the presence of d3-branes as follows.

sinst = 2i = 2i (0)

  < d(1)||d3 > +  

explicit calculation shows4

(6.4)

(6.5)

but there is a subtlety here because there are two dierent 2d harmonic functions :
 log|z| and  arg(z). the nsns-scalar interaction belongs to the former and the
rr-scalar the latter. so we should modify (6.5) as follows

< d(1)()||d3() >n sn s = clog|z| + const
< d(1)()||d3() >rr = ic arg(z) + const
< d(1)()||d3() >n sn s = clog|z| + const
< d(1)()||d3() >rr = ic arg(z) + const.

sinst = 2i = 2i (0)

 + (x

cn)log(z)

(6.6)

(6.7)

so we get

matching the previous result (6.2).

note that this derivation of the background around d3-branes can be seen as the
generalization of the method developed in [14]. to see this, take the low energy limit,
and we can regard |d(1)() > as the vertex operator of twisted nsns and rr scalars.
but it is important that in our case the result is exact if we ignore the nonperturbative
eects, indicating the well known fact that 4d n=2 gauge theories receive no higher loop
corrections.

4d(-1)-d3 system is formally (time like) t-dual to d0-d4 system discussed before and the calculation

is almost the same.

10

6.3 comments on some other aspects of quiver gauge theories

first we consider instantons in these gauge theories. a d-instanton of -type can be
regarded as an instanton of u(n) gauge theory. let us dene the instanton numbers as

1

322 z f f = k.

(6.8)

the bosonic moduli of this instanton corresponds to the bosonic zero modes in ns-sector
d(-1)-d3 open string. so we get

dimminstanton = 4

r

x=1

kn

(6.9)

as expected. unfortunately, as for the fermionic zero modes we get into a puzzle because
the number of zero modes in d(1)  d3 is dierent from that in d(1)  d3. so we
leave this as an open problem.
next we consider chiral transformations. we dene -type chiral transformation which

is analogous to r-symmetry as

  e2i , w  eiw ,   ei
h  h , h  h,

(6.10)

where (w, ) and (h, h) are chiral super eld descriptions of vector multiplet
(u(n) gauge) and hyper multiplet (( n, n) rep.) and  denotes the superspace fermionic
coordinate. here we restrict the value of  such that c 6= 0 and so this chiral transfor-
mation dened for each  is dierent from the conventional u(1) r-symmetry.
for  = , this transformation becomes a classical symmetry of the quiver theory,
but incorporating quantum eects this transformation changes the whole action as s 
s + s. conventional anomaly argument shows

j 

r = 

2

322 (x

cn)f f

 s = (x

cn)

so we get the following monodromy for each 

1

162 z f f .

  e2i ,    + 2x

cn.

(6.11)

(6.12)

this result matches (6.2) indicating the identication :  z.
we conclude this section by mentioning the nonperturbative correction to this quiver
theory from our view point. exact solutions to these theories are already given in [19]
for t-dualized model of an case and so we only comment on what will happen to the
d3-brane system nonperturbatively.

11

so far we assumed that the d3-branes are coincident at the origin, but the eect of

instanton corrections may separate them and generate characteristic mass scales.

let us consider the case p cn < 0 which includes pure n=2 su(n) yang-mills
theory. in this case, (6.2) indicates  (z)  i (z  0) and the interpretation (6.1)
does not work. this means that in this case d3-branes cannot be coincident and should
fragment by the instanton eects until the condition p cn  0 is satised . quite

recently some dynamics of these situations are considered from the viewpoint of ads/cft
correspondence [20].

7 conclusions

in this paper we have investigated the boundary state descriptions of fractional d-branes
at orbifold singularities and calculated some amplitudes of the open sting stretching be-
tween such d-branes which have the topological nature and are proportional to the open
string witten index.

such amplitudes show the occurrence of anomalous string creation when a fractional
dp-brane crosses a fractional d(4-p)-brane in the orbifold(c2/) type ii theory. this
topological nature will not change if we blow up the orbifold and the same phenomenon
will occur in typeii string theory compactied on k3 surfaces.

we have also mentioned the 1-loop monodromies in the quiver gauge theories on frac-
tional d3-branes. such monodromies are equivalent to the string creation phenomenon.
but the interpretation of the fermionic zero modes of d(-1)-d3 string has been left as an
open problem.

our treatment covers all types of d3-brane systems at an orbifold singularity, but if
we take the large n limit, two important possibility can be considered. one possibility
is that there are innite many bulk d-branes which belong to the regular representation

as discussed in [17]. another possibility is that there are many fractional d-branes which

(p cn = 0) and 4d n=2 superconformal eld theories are realized on those systems
belong to one particular type (p cn  ). this case will provide us very interesting

exotic black holes(or repulson) and ads/cft correspondence setups as discussed in [20].
the dynamical aspects of these situations should be studied systematically in the future.
it will be interesting to generalize these results to more general compactications
such as calabi-yau spaces. d-branes on particular calabi-yau spaces have already been
discussed using the boundary state description in [7] for c3/ and [10][9] for quintic
surface. the string creation phenomenon in these examples will again closely be related
to the open string witten index and the intersection numbers and will be able to be
discussed in the same way as our case. so such investigations will require the calculation
of amplitudes at only particular points in the moduli spaces of such calabi-yau spaces.
it will also be interesting to study those string creation mechanism from the viewpoint of
gauge theories on the d-branes.

let (z, z) be world sheet coordinates and (x 0  x 5, z1, z2) (0  5, , ) be the
elds corresponding to spacetime coordinates and their super partners. as in [24], we use
light cone formalism and we regard x 0, x 1 as the light cone direction. we set a = 2, 3, 4, 5
below.

then the string elds in the k-th twisted sector can be expanded as

[boundary state calculations]

in order to determine the coecients in eq.(a.12) we require cardys condition eq.(3.3)

.

before we do that, let us dene z functions following ref.[22].

these functions have following modular properties
