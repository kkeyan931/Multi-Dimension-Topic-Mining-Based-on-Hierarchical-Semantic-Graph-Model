abstract

the atiyah-drinfeld-hitchin-manin matrix corresponding to a tetrahedrally sym-
metric 3-instanton is calculated. some small variations of the matrix correspond to
vibrations of the instanton-generated 3-skyrmion. these vibrations are decomposed
under tetrahedral symmetry and this decomposition is compared to previous knowl-
edge of the 3-skyrmion vibration spectrum.

1 introduction

in the skyrme model, the classical b-nucleon nucleus is a b-skyrmion: a minimum
energy skyrme eld with topological charge b. the b-skyrmions have been calculated
numerically for b up to nine [1, 2].

the skyrme model is nonrenormalizable and so cannot be quantized as a eld theory.
however, it is hoped that the quantum mechanics on some nite-dimensional space in the
charge b sector might give a good model of the quantized b-nucleon. this approach has
been reasonably successfully in the 1-skyrmion case [3] but for higher b it is hard to choose
a suitable, tractible, nite-dimensional space.

the 1-skyrmion is spherically symmetric and has six zero modes: three translational
and three rotational. this suggests that the nite-dimensional space should be 6b-
dimensional and one popular candidate is the gradient-ow manifold descending from the
charge b spherical saddle-point [4]. recently, the vibration spectra of b-skyrmions have
been calculated numerically for b equals two, three, four and seven [5, 6]. it was found
that the the vibration frequencies of the b-skyrmion are divided into two groups by the
breather mode which corresponds to dilation. this suggests that it might be necessary to

add the breather mode to the 6b-dimensional space to give (6b + 1)-dimensions, or even
to include seven dimensions for each skyrmion to give a 7b-dimensional space. another
suggestion is that 8b  3 vibrational modes should be expected [7].
the modes below the breather have been interpreted as being monopole-like and may
correspond to the gradient-ow manifold descending from the saddle-points of innite
skyrmion separation and from the charge b torus [8]. it may be that this is the space
upon which the quantization should be performed. it is a (4b + 2)-dimensional space.

all these spaces are thought to be well approximated by instanton generated skyrme
elds [9, 10]. in the instanton construction, skyrme elds are derived from instanton elds
by calculating their holonomy in the x4 direction [9]. there is a (8b  1)-dimensional
family of baryon number b skyrme elds derived from the space of b-instantons. it is
known for b equals one, two, three and four that the b-skyrmion is well approximated
by an instanton-generated skyrme eld [9, 11]. in this paper the vibrations around the
instanton generated 3-skyrmion are studied. the decomposition of these vibrations as
representations of the tetrahedral group includes the same representations as are found in
the decomposition of the numerically determined spectrum. this seems to indicate that
the numerically determined vibrations are close to being tangent to the space of instanton
generated skyrme elds. it is consistient with the view that, whatever space should be used
to quantize the b-skyrmion, it is approximated by a subspace of the space of instanton
generated skyrme elds.

the 3-skyrmion has tetrahedral symmetry [1]. in [11], the jackiw-nohl-rebbi (jnr)
ansatz [12] is used to derive a tetrahedral 3-instanton. from this, the instanton-generated 3-
skyrmion is calculated. in [13], walet examines vibration modes of the instanton-generated
3-skyrmion by varying the jnr parameters. although a large class of instantons can be
constructed using the jnr ansatz, it is not general. however, the atiyah-drinfeld-hitchin-
manin (adhm) construction [14, 15, 16] is general and, in this paper, the tetrahedral
3-instanton adhm matrix is calculated. the instanton-generated 3-skyrmion vibration
modes are then examined by varying the adhm parameters. the vibration frequencies are
not calculated. however, the vibrations are decomposed under the action of the tetrahedral
symmetry. this allows the decomposition to be compared to other calculations of 3-
skyrmion vibrations.

2 the adhm matrix for the 3-skyrmion

symmetric adhm matrices have been discussed in a recent paper by singer and

sutclie [17] and this should be consulted for any details not included in this section.

the adhm matrix for a b-instanton is a quaternionic matrix

m = (cid:18) l

m (cid:19)

(1)

where l is a b-vector and m is a symmetric b  b matrix. m must satisfy the adhm

2

constraint

m  m is real.

(2)

dagger denotes quaternionic conjugation and matrix transposition.

pure quaternions can be identied with su2 by i = (i, j, k) where  = (1, 2, 3)

are the pauli matrices. with this identication, the instanton gauge elds are

where n(x) is the unit length (b + 1)-vector solving

a(x) = n (x)n(x)

n (x)(cid:18)

l

m  x1b (cid:19) = 0.

(3)

(4)

in this equation, 1b is the b  b identity matrix and the r4 position is written as a
quaternion: x = x4 + x1i + x2j + x3k.

there is an ambiguity in choosing n(x) given by

n(x)  n(x)g(x)

(5)

where g(x) is a unit quaternion. the unit quaternions are identied with the two-dimen-
sional representation of su2 and so this ambiguity corresponds to gauge transformations
of the elds. there is also an ambiguity in m given by
0  (cid:19) m1

m  (cid:18) g 0

(6)

where g is a unit quaternion and  is a real orthogonal b  b matrix. this is a gauge
transformation of the adhm matrix: it does not aect the elds.
this convenient version of the adhm data is the canonical form discussed in [15, 16].
the adhm construction, as originally introduced, involved a larger gauge ambiguity and
a second adhm matrix: a matrix coecient of x in (4). the canonical form is a partial
xing of the larger gauge ambiguity.

under the conjugate action of unit quaternions on x, the real part of x is xed and the
imaginary part transforms under the three-dimensional representation of so3. this means
that for a spatial rotation r there is a quaternion g so that

x4 + (i j k)r


x1
x2
x3


 = gxg1.

(7)

of course, g corresponds to the same r: su2 is a double cover of so3.
unit quaternion g if

as explained in [17], an instanton has the spatial rotation symmetry x  gxg1 for

(cid:18)

l

m  gxg11b (cid:19) = (cid:18) g

0   g (cid:19)(cid:18)

0

3

l

m  x1b (cid:19) g1  1

(8)

where g is a unit quaternion and   g is the product of the real orthogonal matrix  and
the unit quaternion g. thus, the adhm matrix is symmetric if the spatial rotation is
equivalent to a gauge transformation. if the instanton is symmetric under some subgroup
of so3 then the collection of s and of gs form a real b-dimensional representation and
a complex two-dimensional representation of the corresponding binary subgroup of su2.

2.1 the tetrahedrally symmetric adhm matrix

since the 3-skyrmion is tetrahedrally symmetric, the corresponding adhm matrix is
also tetrahedrally symmetric. the tetrahedral group t is the twelve element subgroup of
so3 which, in one orientation, is generated by a rotation of  about the x3-axis and a
rotation of 2/3 about x1 = x2 = x3. these generators will be called r and t respectively
and the corresponding unit quaternions are g(r) = k and g(t) = (1  i  j  k)/2.
the group is isomorphic to the alternating group a4. the tetrahedral double group
is the 24 element subgroup of su2 which double covers the tetrahedral group. the rep-
resentation theory of the tetrahedral group is described in, for example, hamermesh [18].
there are one, two and three dimensional representations derived by restricting the one,
two and three dimensional irreducible representations of su2 to the tetrahedral group.
they are a = 1|t , e = 2|t and f = 3|t where n denotes the irreducible n-dimensional
representation of su2. there is, in addition, the two-dimensional representation e and
the four-dimensional representation g. these representations are reducible into conjugate
pairs of representations with complex characters.

the adhm matrix

mt = (cid:18) lt

mt (cid:19) =

is tetrahedrally symmetric. this matrix was found by trial and error. having written
down a likely form of the matrix it is easy to check whether or not it has the required
symmetries. explicitly, the matrices giving the compensating gauge transformations are

(r) = 


with g(r) = g(r) for r and

(10)

(11)

with g(t) = g(t) for t. thus, in this case the s form the representation f and the gs
form the representation e.

4

mt is not just symmetric under t . it is also symmetric under the 24 element group td

which extends t by the s4 element u:

u : (x1, x2, x3, x4)  (x2, x1,x3,x4).

in fact,

(14)

the representation theory for td is also described in hamermesh [18]. the vector represen-
tation f of t is replaced by a true vector f2 and an axial vector f1. in the same way, the
trivial representation a is replaced by a true scalar a1 and a pseudo-scalar a2. although
reducible as a representation of t , e is irreducible as a representation of td. there are
similar changes to the double group representations.

2.2 uniqueness and the tetrahedrally symmetric adhm matrix
mt is not unique, there is a two-parameter family of tetrahedral matrices given by
x( mt + y14). y can be set to zero. it corresponds to translation of the instanton in the x4
direction and this does not change the corresponding skyrme eld. x is a scale parameter
and, when calculating the instanton-generated skyrmion, the scale is xed by minimization
of the skyrme energy. there can be no more than two parameters because, as explained
in [17], it follows from (8) that

that is

mt : 3|t  (3  2  2)|t

mt : f  3f + e + a

(15)

(16)

and so there is a three-parameter family of candidate mt matrices. this is exhausted by

d
rk
qj




qk rj
qi

 .

(17)

similarly,

lt : (3  2)|t  2|t = e.

(18)
and, since (3  2)|t = e + g, there is a one-parameter family of lt . the symmetry of
mt and the adhm constraint (2) reduce these four parameters to the two parameters x
and y above. there is another two-parameter family of symmetric matrices corresponding
to the dual tetrahedron. this is given by replacing mt in mt by mt .

5

it is possible to translate between jnr data and adhm matrices. this is useful here
because it gives an explicit verication that the 3-skyrmion generating instanton of [11]
lies in the one-parameter family x mt . the general formula, translating jnr data into
adhm data, is given in section 5 of [15]. unfortunately, these adhm data are not in the
canonical form involving a single adhm matrix. it seems that it is dicult to write the
general jnr-derived adhm data in canonical form. however, in the particular case of
interest here, a straight-forward calculation shows that mt is the canonical form of adhm
data derived from tetrahedral jnr data.

3 variations

small variations around mt are now considered. writing

m = mt + m

m satises the linearized adhm constraint

if

the linearized equations are

im( m mt + m 

t m) = 0.

m =

l2

l1
l3
m11 m12 m13
m12 m22 m23
m13 m23 m33







im(l1j + m11k + m13i  il2  km22  jm23) = 0,
im(l1k + m11j + m12i  il3  km23  jm33) = 0,
im(l2k + m22i + m12j  jl3  km13  im33) = 0

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

where bar denotes quaternionic conjugation. these equations can be solved to give expres-
sions for nine of the twelve li parameters. the remaining three components correspond to
the gauge transformation

mt  (cid:18) g

0 13 (cid:19) mt .

0

(23)

this gauge freedom can be xed by requiring, for example, that l1 is proportional to i. in
this way, l may be completely determined by m and by gauge xing.

in order to decompose the 24 mij component as representations of td, the actions of r,

t and u on mt are considered. thus, for example,

(r)g(r)mg(r)1(r)1 = 


km11k km12k
km12k km22k
km13k

km13k
km23k
km23k km33k




(24)

6

and so the character of r is zero. the characters of t and u can be calculated in the same
way: they are also zero. this means that the decomposition of the mij is

a1 + a2 + 2e + 3f1 + 3f2.

(25)

not all of these multiplets correspond to skyrmion vibrations. there remains the gauge

freedom

mt  mt 1.

(26)

by considering an innitesimal  and calculating the character, it is found that this vari-
ation is an f1. the remaining 21 variations correspond to the 21 dimensions of the space
of 3-instantons. however, the variation corresponding to time translation, a2, does not
aect the 3-skyrmion and is discarded. twenty variational modes remain: six of these cor-
respond to zero modes. in fact, the translation and rotation zero modes of the skyrmion
correspond to an f2 and an f1 respectively. thus, the instanton modes of the 3-skyrmion
decompose as

a1 + 2e + 2f1 + 3f2

(27)

under td and, of these, one f1 and one f2 are zero modes and the rest are vibrational
modes. the isospin zero modes are not included in this decomposition because they do
not correspond to variations of the adhm matrix.

4 discussion

the a1 is the breather mode corresponding to dilation. in the numerical results of
baskerville, barnes and turok [5], it appears in the middle of the vibration spectrum. in
order of increasing frequency and ignoring radiation, baskerville, barnes and turok nd
the spectrum to be

f2 + e + a1 + f2 + e.

(28)

the e + f2 above the breather are discussed in [7] by baskerville and michaels.

the e + f2 below the breather are the modes described in [8] as monopole modes. they
correspond to variations of the rational map parameters in the rational map ansatz of [8].
it
has been observed that, to a good approximation, there are 2b  2 straight lines of zero
baryon density, known as branch lines, radiating from the centre of a b-skyrmion. in [7],
the variations of the angular positions of the branch lines are parametrized. these are then
decomposed. it is noted that if an axial vector is removed from this decomposition, the
decomposition then matches the super-breather modes in the 2-skyrmion and 3-skyrmion
spectra. in the 4-skyrmion case the decomposition is consistent with the observed spec-
trum. baskerville and michaels interprete the axial vector which must be removed as the
axial vector of rotational zero modes.

some of the monopole modes also change the branch line positions. therefore, [7]
implies that the super-breather mode decomposition duplicates part of the decomposition
of the monopole modes. there are, in total, 4b + 2 monopole modes of a b-skyrmion.

7

six of them do not change the branch lines: of these, three are the isospin zero modes.
because the parameters in the rational map are complex, the monopole modes come in
pairs of opposite parity. there are three monopole modes which compose pairs with isospin
modes in this way. these are the other three modes which do not change the positions
of branch lines. the remaining 4b  4 modes change the positions of the branch lines.
these 4b  4 modes include the three translational and three rotational zero modes along
with 4b  10 vibrational modes. thus, there are 4b  7 monopole modes which are not
rotational zero modes and which change the positions of the branch lines. it is possible
to reformulate the observation made in [7]: the decomposition of these 4b  7 modes
duplicates the decomposition of the super-breather modes.
thus, an exception is made for the rotational zero modes, the translational zero modes
in fact, in the b = 3 case, the
are duplicated but the rotational zero modes are not.
instanton modes contain a f1 duplicating the rotational zero modes. this f1 has not been
observed numerically. the reason for this may be that the f1 mode has a rather high
frequency.

for b = 3, the monopole modes which x the branch line positions are an f1 of isospin
and an f2 vibration. the monopole modes which change the branch line positions are the
rotational and translational zero modes f1 + f2 and the multiplet of vibration modes e.
thus, the e in the super-breather part of the 3-skyrmion spectrum duplicates the e in
the monopole part. the f2 duplicates the translational zero modes. if a duplicate is also
included for the rotational zero modes; then the aggregate of the breather, the monopole
modes and their duplicates matches the instanton mode decomposition (27).

because walet uses jnr ansatz instantons, not all of the instanton modes are included
in the harmonic analysis of [13]. to be precise, there is only one e, whereas the adhm
construction gives two. in the case of the rational map decomposition, it is known that
the e is spanned by tangent vectors lying along the s4 symmetric geodesics. these are
referred to in [19] as twisted line scattering geodesics.

there is a three-dimensional family of adhm matrices, symmetric under the d2d gen-
erated by u and  rotations about the cartesian axes. vibrations tangent to this family
lie in the a1 + 2e of the decomposition (27). the symmetric adhm matrices are

md2d =

ai aj
bk
e
ck
dj
ck e di
0
dj

di







with, from the adhm constraint,

ab + de  dc = 0
d2  a2 + 2ec = 0.

(29)

(30)

for a = b = c = d = x and e = 0 this is mt and for a = c = d = e = 0 it is axially
symmetric about the x3-axis. translating d2d jnr data to adhm data and rewriting it in
canonical form gives the two-parameter subfamily with a = d, c = b and e = 0. however,

8

as noted by walet, this subfamily of d2d symmetric adhm matrices shares the curious
feature of the th matrices in [17], it does not include well-separated instantons of equal
scale. more complicated subfamilies, including well-separated instantons of equal scale,
may be chosen by using arguments similar to those in [17]. one simple example, with
b = 1 xing the scale, is

e =

c(c2  1)
2(c4 + 1)

.

(31)

of course, this is just one path which passes though the various features associated with
twisted line scattering. the innitesimal behaviour around mt does not give the splitting
of the 2e into a sub-breather e and the super-breather e. it is not known how to make
this split, without calculating the holonomy and performing the full harmonic analysis as
walet did for jnr ansatz instanton-generated 3-skyrmions.

in conclusion, the instanton modes of the 3-skyrmion have been calculated and de-
composed. the decomposition ts well with other similar decompositions. the primary
question provoked by the calculations is whether it is possible to split the modes further
without undertaking the harmonic analysis.
