in the light of mapping method and the topological tensor current theory, the topological
structure and the topological quantization of topological defects are obtained under the condition
that jacobian j(/v) 6= 0. when j(/v) = 0, it is shown that there exists the crucial case of
branch process. based on the implicit function theorem and the taylor expansion, the generation,
annihilation and bifurcation of the linear defects are detailed in the neighborhoods of the limit points
and bifurcation points of mapping, respectively.

i. introduction

there have been rapid and exciting developments over the last decades on the interface between paticle physics
and cosmology1. particle physicists pursing the goal of unication would like to test their theories at energy scales
far beyond those available now or in the future in terrestrial accelerators. an obvious place to look is to the very
early universe, where conditions of extreme temperature and density obtained. meanwhile, cosmologists have sought
to understand feature of the universe currently observed by tracing their history back to that very early period. an
exciting outcome of the interplay between particle physics and cosmology is the cosmic string theory24. it is strongly
believed to solve the short-distance problems of quantum gravity at the plank scale by providing a fundamental length
lstr = phc/t , where t is the string tension, and provides a bridge between the physics of the very small and the
past researches have mostly focused on the dynamical properties of the cosmic strings57, and all of them are based
in our previous work8, by making use of the mapping topological current theory9,
on some particular models.
which play an important role in discussing the topological invariant and structure of the physical system913, we have
studied the topological structure and topological quantization of cosmic strings without any concrete model. in this
paper, based on our previous work, we will study the generating, annihilating, colliding, splitting and merging of
cosmic strings in topology viewpoint, and give the branch conditions of cosmic strings without any concrete model.

very large. the research in the topic of cosmic strings can help to explain some of the largestscale structure seen in
the universe today.

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, a brief review of the topological structure and the topological
quantization of cosmic strings is given. in section 3, by virtue of the implicit function theorem, the creation and
annihilation of cosmic strings at the limit points is discussed. the bifurcation behaviour of strings is detailed in the
neighborhood of bifurcation point in section 4.

ii. topological structure and topological quantization of cosmic strings

cosmic strings are linear defects14 in four dimensional space-time x, analogous to those topological defects found in
some condensed matter systems such as vortex lines in liquid helium, ux tubes in type-ii superconductors or disclina-
tion lines in liquid crystal, and they are closely related to the torsion tensor of the riemanncartan manifold10,1517.

in vierbein theory, the torsion tensor is expressed by

 is the vierbein eld. as in our previous work8, by analogy with the t hoofts viewpoint18, to establish a
where ea
physical observable theory of spacetime defect, we must rst dene a gauge invariant antisymmetrical 2order tensor
from torsion tensor with respect of a unit vector eld n a(x) as follows

t = t a

 n a + ea

 dn a  ea

 dn a = a   a

(2)

where a = ea
 n a is a kind of u (1) gauge potential. this shows that the antisymmetrical tensor t expressed in
terms of a is just the u (1) like gauge eld strength (i.e. the curvature on u (1) principle bundle with base manifold
x ), which is invariant for the u (1)like gauge transformation

a

(x) = a(x) + (x)

(3)

where (x) is an arbitrary function.

in order to study the string theory, we should extend the traditional concept of topological currents9 which have
been used to study the topological properties of point like defects13,19 , and introduce a topological tensor current
of second order from torsion. from the above discussions, we can dene a topological tensor current j as the dual
tensor of t as follow

j =

t =

(a  a).

very commonly, topological property of a physical system is much more important and worth investigating medicu-
lously. it is our conviction that, in order to get a topological result, one should input the topological information from
the beginning. two useful tools-mapping method and composed gauge potential theory9,11 just do the work.
as mentioned in our previous works8,10, the decomposation of a(x) can be expressed by

a(x) =

lp
2

abna(x)nb(x);

na(x) =

a(x)
||(x)||

,

(5)

where a(x) is the order parameter eld of cosmic strings, and lp = phg/c3 is the planck length introduced to make

the both sides of the formula with the same dimension10. with the decomposition of a in (5), j can be expressed
in terms of na by

j =

lp
2

1
gx

abnanb,

(6)

which shows that j is just an antisymmetric and identically conserved 2-order topological tensor current. because
of the topological property of na, we input the topological information successfully. obviously, na(x)na(x) = 1, and
na(x) is a section of the sphere bundle s (x)9. the zero points of a(x) are just the singular points of na(x).

by making use of the expression of na in (5) and the laplacian relation in -space

the topological tensor current j can be rewritten in a compact form

aa lnkk = 2(~),

a =


a ,

j =

1
gx

lp(~)j  (


x

),

where j  ( 

x ) is the general jacobian determinants

abj  (


x

) = ab.

it is obvious that j is non-zero only when ~ = 0.

suppose that for the system of equations

1(x) = 0, 2(x) = 0,

(7)

(8)

there are l dierent solutions, when the solutions are regular solutions of  at which the rank of the jacobian matrix
[a] is 2, the solutions of ~(x) = 0 can be expressed parameterizedly by

2

x = z

i (u1, u2), i = 1,  l,

(9)

where the subscript i represents the i-th solution and the parameters ui (i = 1, 2) span a 2-dimensional submanifold
x
uj which is called the i-th singular submanifold ni in x. for each ni, we
with the metric tensor gij = g
can dene a normal submanifold mi in x which is spanned by the parameters va(a = 1, 2) with the metric tensor
x
gab = g
vb , and the intersection point of mi and ni is denoted by pi. by virtue of the implicit function
theorem, at the regular point pi, it should be hold true that the jacobian matrix j( 

x
va

v ) satises

more deeper calculation can lead to the total expansion of the string current

j(

d(v1, v2) 6= 0.

j =

where i is a positive integer called the hopf index20 of -mapping on mi and i = signj(

8,21 with the expression

v )pi = 1 is the brouwer

(ni) = zni

gx

4(~x  ~zi(u1, u2))gud2u.

from the above equation, we conclude that the inner structure of j or jab is labelled by the total expansion
of (~), which includes the topological information i and i. it is obvious that, in (9), when u1 and u2 are taken
to be time-like evolution parameter and space-like string parameter, respectively, the inner structure of j or jab
just represents l strings moving in the 4dimensional riemann-cartan manifold x. the 2-dimensional singular
submanifolds ni (i = 1, l) are their world sheets. the hopf indices i and brouwer degree i classify these strings.
in detail, the hopf indices i characterize the absolute values of the topological quantization and the brouwer degrees
i = +1 correspond to strings while i = 1 to antistrings.

iii. the branch process of strings at limit points

but from the above discussion, we know that the results mentioned above are obtained under the condition
6= 0. when this condition fails, i.e. the brouwer degrees i are indenite, what will happen? in what
j(/v)|pi
follows, we will study the case when j(/v)|pi = 0. it often happens when the zero of ~ includes some branch points,
which lead to the bifurcation of the topological current.
in order to discuss the evolution of these strings and to simplify our study, we select the parameter u1 as the
evolution parameter t, and let the string parameter u2 =  be xed. in this case, the jacobian matrices are reduced
to

j a4  j a, j ab = 0, j 3 = j 34 = j(


v

), a, b = 1, 2, 3,

for y4 = u2  . the branch points are determined by

1(v1, v2, t, ) = 0
2(v1, v2, t, ) = 0
3(v1, v2, t, )  j( 

v ) = 0

(13)




for the xed , and they are denoted as (t, pi). in -mapping theory usually there are two kinds of branch points,
namely the limit points and the bifurcation points22, each kind of them corresponds to dierent cases of branch
process.

3

first, in this section, we study the case that the zeros of the order parameter eld ~ includes some limit points

which satisfying

j a(


y

)|(t,pi) 6= 0,

a = 1

or

2

(14)

for simplicity, we consider a = 1 only.

for the purpose of using the implicit function theorem to study the branch properties of sstrings at the limit points,
v ) to search for the solutions of ~ = 0. this means we have replaced v1 by

y ) instead of j( 

we use the jacobian j 1( 
t. for clarity we rewrite the rst two equations of (13) as

a(t, v2, v1, ) = 0,

a = 1, 2.

(15)

taking account of (14) and using the implicit function theorem, we have a unique solution of the equations (15) in
the neighborhood of the limit point (t, pi)

t = t(v1, ),

v2 = v2(v1, )

(16)

with t = t(p1
i , ). in order to show the behavior of the strings at the limit points, we will investigate the taylor
expansion of (16) in the neighborhood of (t, pi). in the present case, from (14) and the last equation of (13), we get

i.e.

dv1
dt

=

j 1( 
y )
v ) |(t,pi) = 
j( 

dt
dv1 |(t,pi) = 0.

then, the taylor expansion of t = t(v1, ) at the limit point (t, pi) is

t = t(p1

i , ) +

dt
dv1 |(t,pi)(v1  p1

i ) +

which is a parabola in v1t plane. from (17) we can obtain two solutions v1

(2)(t, ), which give the
(dv1)2|(t,zi) > 0, we have the branch solutions for t > t (fig 1(a)),
branch solutions of strings at the limit points. if
otherwise, we have the branch solutions for t < t (fig 1(b)). since the topological current of strings is identically
conserved, the topological quantum numbers of these two generated strings must be opposite at the limit point, i.e.
11 + 22 = 0, the former is related to the creation of cosmic strings and antistrings in pair at the limit points, and
the latter to the annihilation of the cosmic strings.

iv. the branch process of strings at bifurcation points

in the following, let us turn to consider the case of bifurcation point in which the additional restrictions are

j 1(


y

)|(t,pi) = 0,

j 2(


y

)|(t,pi) = 0.

(18)

these two restrictive conditions will lead to an important fact that the function relationship between t and v1 or v2
is not unique in the neighborhood of bifurcation point (t, pi). the equation

4

dv1
dt

=

j 1( 
y )
v ) |(t,pi)
j( 

(19)

which under restraint of (18) directly shows that the direction of the integral curve of (19) is indenite at the point
(t, pi). this is why the very point (t, pi) is called a bifurcation point of the multistring current. with the aim of
nding the dierent directions of all branch curves at the bifurcation point, we suppose that

from 1(v1, v2, t, ) = 0, the implicit function theorem says that there exists one and only one function relationship

1
v2 |(t,pi) 6= 0.

(20)

(21)

(22)

v2 = v2(v1, t, )

with the partial derivatives f 2

1 = v2/v1, f 2

t = v2/t. substituting (21) into 1, we have
1(v1, u2(v1, t, ), t, )  0

which gives

from these expressions we can calculate the values of f 2

11, f 2

tt at (t, pi).

in order to explore the behavior of the string at the bifurcation points, let us investigate the taylor expansion of

in the neighborhood of (t, pi), which according to the eqs.(13) must vanish at the bifurcation point, i.e.

f (v1, t, ) = 2(v1, v2(v1, t, ), t, )

from (23), the rst order partial derivatives of f (v1, t, ) with respect to v1 and t can be expressed by

f (t, pi) = 0.

(25)

making use of (22), (25) and cramers rule, it is easy to prove that the two restrictive conditions (18) can be rewritten
as

j(

j 1(

which give

f

f

by considering (20). the second order partial derivatives of the function f are easily to nd out to be

(26)

(27)

then, taking notice of (24), (26) and (27), we can obtain the taylor expansion of f (v1, t, ) in the neighborhood of
the bifurcation point (t, pi)

f (v1, t, ) =

1
2

a(v1  p1

i )2 + b(v1  p1

i )(t  t) +

1
2

c(t  t)2

which by (23) is the behavior of 2 in this region. because of the second equation of (13), we get

a(v1  p1

i )2 + 2b(v1  p1

i )(t  t) + c(t  t)2 = 0

which leads to

and

a(

+ c = 0

c(

dv1 + a = 0.

(28)

(29)

the dierent directions of the branch curves at the bifurcation point are determined by (28) or (29). there are four
possible cases:

case1 (a 6= 0): for  = b2  ac > 0, from (28) we get two dierent solutions

dv1

dt |1,2= b  b2  ac

a

,

(30)

which is shown in fig. 2, where two cosmic strings collide at the bifurcation point (t, pi). this shows that two
cosmic strings meet and then depart at the bifurcation point.

case2 (a 6= 0): for  = b2  ac = 0, there is only one solution

dv1
dt

= b/a,

(31)

which includes three important cases shown in fig. 3. firstly, two cosmic strings tangentially collide at the
bifurcation point (fig. 3(a)). secondly, two cosmic strings merge into one cosmic string at the bifurcation point
(fig. 3(b)). thirdly, one cosmic string splits into two cosmic strings at the bifurcation point (fig. 3(c)).

case3 (a = 0, c 6= 0): for  = b2  ac > 0, from (29) we have
dv1 |1,2= b  b2  ac

dt

c

= (cid:26) 0
 2b
c .

(32)

as shown in fig. 4, there are two important cases: (a)one cosmic string splits into three cosmic strings at the
bifurcation point (fig. 4(a)). (b) three cosmic strings merge into one at the bifurcation point (fig. 4(b)).

case4 (a = c = 0): the equations (28) and (29) give respectively:

dv1
dt

= 0,

dt
dv1 = 0.

(33)

this case is obvious as in fig. 5, which is similar to the third situation.

the remainder component dv2/dt can be given by

dv2

t have been calculated in (22).

where partial derivative coecients f 2

at the end of this section, we conclude that in our string theory there exist the crucial case of branch process. this
means that, when an original string moves through the bifurcation point in the early universe, it may split into two
strings moving along dierent branch curves. since the topological current of strings is identically conserved, the sum
of the topological quantum numbers of these two splitted strings must be equal to that of the original string at the
bifurcation point, i.e.

for xed i. this can be looked upon as the topological reason of string splitting.

i1 i1 + i2 i2 = ii

v. conclusion

in this paper, with the gauge potential decomposition and the so called -mapping method, we obtain the topological
current to describe the strings in 4dimensional riemanncartan manifold. in the early universe, by discussing the
properties of the zero points of the vector eld  and the expansion of the delta function (~), we get the topological
quantization of the strings under the condition that the jacobian j( 
v ) 6= 0, and pointed out that the singular
manifolds are just the evolution manifolds of these strings. when the jacobian j( 
v ) = 0, i.e. at the critical points
of -mapping, it is shown that there exist the crucial case of branch process. based on the implicit function theorem
and the taylor expansion, the origin and bifurcation of the strings are detailed in the neighborhoods of the limit
points and bifurcation points of -mapping respectively, i.e. the branch solutions at the limit points and the dierent
directions of all branch curves at the bifurcation points are calculated out. because the topological current of these
strings is identically conserved, the topological charges of these strings will keep to be constant during the branch
processes, which means that the topological quantum numbers of the two generated string currents must be opposite
at the limit point and, at the bifurcation point, the sum of the topological quantum numbers of the splitted strings
must be equal to that of the original.

fig. 1. (a) the creation of two cosmic strings. (b) two cosmic strings annihilate in collision at the limit point.
fig. 2. two cosmic strings collide with dierent directions of motion at the bifurcation point.
fig. 3. cosmic strings have the same direction of motion.

(a) two cosmic strings tangentially collide at the
bifurcation point. (b) two cosmic strings merge into one cosmic string at the bifurcation point. (c) one cosmic string
splits into two cosmic strings at the bifurcation point.

fig. 4. (a) one cosmic string splits into three cosmic strings at the bifurcation point. (b) three cosmic strings

merge into one cosmic string at the bifurcation point.

fig. 5. this case is similar to fig. 5. (a) three cosmic strings merge into one cosmic string at the bifurcation

point. (b) one cosmic string splits into three cosmic strings at the bifurcation point.
