abstract

using the auxiliary eld representation of the simplicial chiral models on a (d 1)
dimensional simplex, the simplicial chiral models are generalized through replacing
the term tr(aa) in the lagrangian of these models by an arbitrary class function
of aa; v (aa). this is the same method used in dening the generalized two
dimensional yangmills theories (gym2) from ordinary ym2. we call these models,
the generalized simplicial chiral models. using the results of the onelink integral
over a u(n ) matrix, the largen saddlepoint equations for eigenvalue density function
(z) in the weak ( > c) and strong ( < c) regions are computed. in d = 2, where
the model is in some sense related to the gym2 theory, the saddlepoint equations are
solved for (z) in the two regions, and the explicit value of critical point c is calculated
for v (b)=trbn (b = aa). for v (b)=trb2,trb3, and trb4, the critical behaviour
of the model at d = 2 is studied, and by calculating the internal energy, it is shown
that these models have a third order phase transition.

introduction

one of the useful approaches in studying the largescale structure of nonabelian gauge
theories is via the lattice formulation introduced by wilson [1], in which a matrixvalued
eld theory is dened on a lattice. after the work of wilson, several other matrix models
have been introduced and their properties have been studied. one of the most important
features of matrix models, is their largen behaviour, where n is a quantity related to the
number of eld components. this goes back to the original work by stanley [2] on the large
n limit of spin system with o(n) symmetry, soon followed by wilsons suggestion that
the 1/n expansion may be a valuable alternative in the context of renormalization group
evaluation of critical exponents, and by t hooft extension [3] to gauge theories and, more
generally, to elds belonging to the adjoint representation of su(n) groups. therefore the
1/n expansion is probably the most important nonperturbative and analytical tool presently
available in the study of matrix models. unfortunately, application of this tool is limited to
a small number of fewmatrix systems. this number is even smaller if we restrict ourselves
to the case of unitary matrix elds, which is especially relevant to the problem of lattice
qcd. to the best of our knowledge, the only solved examples are grosswittens single
link problem [4] and its generalizations, the external eld problem [5, 6], and l = 3, 4 chiral
chains [7, 8].

one of the important classes of the unitary matrix models, as mentioned above, are
few unitarymatrix systems. the interest for fewmatrix models may arise for various rea-
sons. for example, their largen solutions may represent nontrivial benchmarks for new
methods meant to investigate the largen limit of more complex matrix models, such as
qcd. furthermore, every matrix system may have a role in the context of twodimensional
quantum gravity; indeed, via the double scaling limit, its critical behaviour is connected
to twodimensional models of matter coupled to gravity. for more discussion about these
models see ref. [9].

an interesting class of nitelattice matrix models is obtained by considering the pos-
sibility that each of a nite number of unitary matrices may interact in a fully symmetric
way with each other, while preserving global chiral invariance; the resulting system can be
described as a chiral model on a (d  1)dimensional simplex. a simplex is formed by con-
necting d vertices by d(d 1)/2 links. these models are known as simplicial chiral models
(scm) [10]. in ref.
[11], the largen saddlepoint equations for density function (z) of
these models have been found. the main strategy for the determination of these equations,
is based on the introduction of a single auxiliary variable a (a complex matrix), leading to
the decoupling of the unitary matrix interaction. the resulting action, contains a tr(aa)
term and some other linear terms in a and a. performing the singlelink external eld in-
tegral, the authors of [10] have found the saddlepoint equations. in d = 2 (where the model

1

corresponds to the grosswitten singlelink problem, which in turn is equivalent to largen
qcd2 with wilson action on the lattice), d = 4, and d  , the saddlepoint equations
have been studied analytically. it was shown that the critical value of (= (g2n)1, where
g is coupling constant) is c = 1/d for all d. also for 0  d < 4, it has been shown that
the model exhibits the thirdorder phase transition, and for 4 < d <  it has a rstorder
phase transition.

on the other hand, it is known that the pure 2dimensional yangmills theory (ym2),
with tr(f 2) lagrangian, can be also represented by the lagrangian itr(bf )+ tr(b2) , in
which b is an auxiliary pseudoscalar eld in the adjoint representation of the gauge group.
path integration over b, leaves an eective lagrangian tr(f 2). now the generalized 2
dimensional yangmills theory (gym2) is a theory with the above lagrangian in which the
term tr(b2) is replaced by an arbitrary class function f (b) [12]. the partition function of
gym2 has been calculated in dierent contexts in [12], [13], and [14]. also the phase structure
of these models, at largen limit, have been studied in [15], in [16] for f (b)=tr(b4), and in
[17] for f (b)=tr(b6) and tr(b2) + gtr(b4). in [16] and [17], it has been shown that these
models have a thirdorder phase transition, as ordinary ym2.

in this paper, we want to introduce and study the generalized simplicial chiral models
(gscm), in the same fashion that gym2 has been dened, that is, through replacement of
the term tr(aa) in scm by v (aa), where v (aa) is an arbitrary class function of aa.
in this way, we have a new fewmatrix model on a (d 1)simplex which, in the special case
v =tr(aa), reduces to ordinary scm. in d = 2, where this model is in some sense related
to gym2, we see that the study of the phase structure of the model is much easier than the
corresponding studies in gym2.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we introduce the gscm and, using the
singlelink integral method, nd the largen saddlepoint equations for eigenvalue density
function (z) in the weak and strong regions. since these equations for arbitrary v (b)
(b = aa) are complicated, they can not be solved analytically for arbitrary d. note that
this is also true for v (b) =trb, i.e. scm, and as mentioned earlier, for very few cases
one can compute the density function (z) analytically. here the situation is worse and
therefore we restrict ourselves to d = 2. in section 3, the general case v (b) =tr(bn), with
n an arbitrary positive integer number, is considered and an expression for internal energy
in terms of (z) (for arbitrary d), and also the critical value c for d = 2 are found.
in
section 4, considering the leading terms of (z) (near the critical point) in weak and strong
regions (again in d = 2), it is shown that for v (b) =tr(b2), tr(b3), and tr(b4) the model
exhibits a third order phase transition. we believe that this behaviour (the third order phase
transition) is the same for all v (b) =tr(bn) models.

gscm and their saddlepoint equation

if we assign a u(n) matrix to each vertex of a (d1)dimensional simplex, then the partition
function of simplicial chiral models is dened by [10]

zd(, n) = z

d

yi=1

duiexp{n

d

d

xi=1

xj=i+1

tr(uiu 

j + u 

i uj)},

(1)

where dui is the normalized invariant haar measure. the dmatrix simplicial model has
an underlying permutation symmetry instead of the cyclic symmetry of the dmatrix chiral
chain. but for d = 1, 2, and 3 these two symmetries and the associated models are equivalent.
the free energy, internal energy, and specic heat are respectively given by

fd(, n) =

ud(, n) =

1
n 2 lnzd(, n),
fd(, n)
1
2



,

cd(, n) = 2 ud(, n)



.

(2)

as mentioned earlier, the main strategy for determination of the largen saddlepoint equa-
tion is based on the introduction of a single auxiliary variable a (a complex matrix), leading
to the decoupling of the unitary matrix interaction [10]

zd = zd/ z0,

(3)

where

zd = z

d

yi=1

duidaexp{ntraa + ntraxi

u 

i + ntraxi

ui  n 2d}.

(4)

performing the singlelink integral over the matrices ui

en w (bb)  z duexp[ntr(bu + u b)],

(5)

(6)

we obtain

zd = z daexp{ntraa + ndw (2aa)  n 2d}.

now we dene the generalized simplicial chiral model (gscm) through the partition

function

where

zd,v = zd,v / z0,v ,

zd,v = z daexp{nv (aa) + ndw (2aa)  n 2d},

3

(7)

(8)

in which v (aa) is an arbitrary class function of aa, that is

v (gaag1) = v (aa),

g  u(n).

the requirement (9) is satised for every polynomial

v (aa) = xn=1

antr(aa)n.

(9)

(10)

the crucial point in our analysis is that the integrand in eq.(8) is a function of eigenvalues
xi of the hermitian semi-positivedenite matrix 2aa. moreover, as zd,v is invariant under
a  gag (where g and g are arbitrary unitary matrices), one can perform exactly the
angular integration and reduce the problem to that of integration over n variables [18].
therefore, performing the angular integration, eq.(8) leads to

zd,v = z d(xi)exp{nv (xi/2) + ndw (xi)  n 2d},

where

d(xi) = yi

dxiyi>j

(xi  xj)2.

(11)

(12)

in the largen limit, in which we are interested, the freeenergy function w (xi), resulting
from a singlelink integral over a u(n) matrix, can be extracted by solving the schwinger
dyson equations. it is written in a simple closed form [5, 6]

w (xi) = 2xi

xi + c 

1

2n xij

ln(xi + c +qxj + c)  nc

we must distinguish two dierent phases, a weakcoupling regime where c = 0 and

1

2n xi

1
xi  1,

and a strongcoupling regime where c is dynamically determined by the condition

1

2n xi

1

xi + c

= 1.

therefore, in the largen limit the partition function (11) reduces to

zd,v = z

yi=1

with the action

sd,v ({xi}) = 2xi>j

(17)

and the saddlepoint equation s/xi = 0 becomes (after multiplying it by (1/n)xi + c )

xi + c

v (xi/2)  d =

2n xj6=i

(4  d)xi + c + dxj + c

,

(18)

with the condition xi  0. to study eq.(18), we use the standard technique which is based
on the eigenvalue density function. it is however convenient rst to introduce a new variable
zi with denition

zi = xi + c,

(19)

subject to the condition 0  c  zi. if the eigenvalue variable xi varies in the interval
[xa, xb], 0  xa  xb, then the new variable zi lies in interval [a, b] where a = c + xa, b =
c + xb, and

0  c  a  b.

(20)
in the weakcoupling regime, c = 0, one expects in general a = xa > 0, and in the
strongcoupling regime, one expects xa = 0 so that a = c 6= 0 [11].

now, using the largen eigenvalue density function (z), which vanishes outside the in-
terval [a, b], the saddlepoint equation (18) can be turned into the following integral equation

in which we use the expression (10) for v and p indicates the principal value of integral. in
this equation, the parameters a and b must be determined dynamically. the normalization
condition of (z) is

(z)dz = 1.

(22)

in the weak coupling regime, cw = 0 and the condition (14) in the largen limit becomes

in the strong coupling regime, where c is

the condition (15) becomes

eq. (21) has a somewhat unconventional form when compared to other integral equations,
and one must perform a few manipulations to obtain a more familiar equation. to do so,
we dene the function h(z) in the complexz plane

h(z) = z b

a

()
z  

d.

(26)

this function is analytic on the entire complex plane except for a cut on the positive real
axis in the interval [a, b]. then one has

h(z  i) = r(z)  i(z)

,

b  z  a,

where r(z), from eq.(21), is

r(z) = z xn=1
= z xn=1

(27)

(28)

the constraints (23) and (25) for weak and strongcoupling regimes, respectively, result in
hw(0)  2 and hs(0) = 2. but, from eqs. (27) and (28), it can be shown that h(0) must
satisfy h(0) = d  d2
2 h(0)  i(0), or h(0) = 2  (2i/d)(0). so the weak density
function must satisfy

and strong density function must satisfy

 iw(0)  0,

 is(0) = 0.

(29)

(30)

therefore, the analytical properties of h(z) in the two regimes must be such that the con-
straints (29) and (30) are satised. using the standard method of solving the integral
equations [19], one can show that the expression

hw(z) =

1

2iq(z  a)(z  b)ic

rw()d

(z  )q(  a)(  b)

,

(31)

has the correct analytical behaviour in weakcoupling region. the contour c in (31) is a
contour encircling the cut [a, b] and excluding z. deforming c to a contour around the point
z and the contour c (a contour at the innity), one nds

hw(z) = rw(z) +

1

2iq(z  a)(z  b)ic

rw()d

(z  )q(  a)(  b)

.

(32)

6

remembering cw = 0 and using eqs.(27) and (28), it can be easily shown that the saddle
point equation (21) reduces to the following expression for the density function w(z)

w(z) = q(b  z)(z  a)



where

in the strongcoupling regime, one can again show that

v (aa) =tr(aa)), the eqs.(33) and (36) reduce to the corresponding equations in [11].

it can be seen that in the special case an = n,1 (which corresponds to

as it is obvious from eqs.(33) and (36), here the situation is much more involved than in
scm, and the most of analytical calculations done in [11] can not be done here. one of these
kinds of calculations is discussed in the next section. therefore, let us restrict ourselves to
the case d = 2, for which from eqs.(33) and (36) the density functions are known.

other quantities that must be determined in d = 2 are the values of parameters a and b
in the both regimes. to nd these parameters, we note that at |z|  , eqs.(26) and (22)
imply that h(z)  1/z or (cid:16)1/q(z  a)(z  b) (cid:17) h(z)  1/z2. therefore, we can expand
(cid:16)1/q(z  a)(z  b) (cid:17) (rw(z) iw(z)) (at d = 2), and take the coecients of 1/z and 1/z2

equal to 0 and 1, respectively. in this way we nd the following equations which must be
solved to determine a and b in  > c

(39)

in the strong region, as (1/z)q(z  a)/(z  b)h(z)  1/z2 at |z|  , we can again expand
(1/z)q(z  a)/(z  b)(rs(z)  is(z)) (at d = 2) and take the coecients of 1/z and 1/z2

equal to 0 and 1, respectively, and then nd the following equations which determine a and
b in  < c

(40)

(41)

both sets of equations (38), (39) and (40), (41) are too complicated to be solved exactly.
we discuss about the solutions of these equations in section 4.

some general results for v =tr(aa)n

let us rst derive an expression for the internal energy in terms of (z) for arbitrary d. if
we denote the internal energy per unit link by ud,v , then the rst two equations of (2) lead
to

d(d  1)

2

ud,v =

1
2

fd,v


=

1

2n 2




(ln zd,v  ln z0,v ),

(42)

where d(d  1)/2 is the number of links. note that ln zd,v  sd,v {xi}, where xis are the
solutions of the saddlepoint equation (18) with density functions (33) and (36) in the weak
and strong regions, respectively, and sd,v {xi} is given by eq.(17). therefore, using eq.(17)
for v = pi(xi/2)n, the eq.(42) reduces to
2n  1
n2n xi

d(d  1)ud,n =

(43)

now it is interesting that one can calculate the last term of the above equation exactly. in
d = 0, eq.(11) is

therefore

z0,n = n 2(2n1)/n  (independent terms),

and from this, eq.(43) becomes

d(d  1)ud,n =

in the largen limit, this equation for weak and strong regimes becomes

(49)

respectively. again, in the case n = 1, where the model is scm, the above equations reduce
to the corresponding equations found in [11]. as can be seen from these relations, the power
of variables in the integrands makes the integrations dicult to perform, even when the
density functions are known. let us show this by an example.
it can be shown that in
d > 4, the critical value of a is dierent from zero (ac 6= 0) [11], and of course at this point
s = w = c. therefore, at the critical point we have

d(d  1)[u (s)

d,n  u (w)

d,n ] =

2n  1
2n

c

z bc

ac

[(z2  a2

c)n  z2n]c(z)dz.

for scm ,where n = 1, the above dierence reduces to (using eq.(22))

d,1  u (w)

d,1 ] = 

a2
c
2

c z bc

ac

c(z)dz =

c 6= 0,
2

(50)

(51)

and this simply proves that there exists a rstorder phase transition in scm with d > 4,
although we do not know the explicit form of c(z). but if n is dierent from 1, the same
calculation is not possible. for example if n = 2, eq.(50) gives

d(d  1)[u (s)

d,2  u (w)

d,2 ] =

3a2
c

c

[a2

c  2z bc

ac

c(z)z2dz].

(52)

in this case one must know c(z) to say something about the result.

so let us again restrict ourselves to d = 2, and try to nd the critical value c for
v =tr(aa)n. as mentioned above, at the critical point s(z) = w(z) = c(z) and therefore
the constraint (30) must also hold for w(z) at this point,i.e., critical
(0) = 0. using (33) for
d = 2 and putting z = 0, we obtain

w

qacbcxp=0

cpc2n2p2ap

cb2n2p2

c

= 0.

(53)

as the coecients of all terms in the above equation are positive, and 0  ac < bc, the only
nontrivial solution of (53) is

therefore, at the critical point eqs.(40) and (41) reduce to

ac = 0 ,

for d = 2.

v =tr(aa)n in d = 2 as following

.

(57)

in the case n = 1 (scm), eq.(57) gives c = 1/2, which is the correct value of c in the
grosswitten singlelink problem.

4 phase structure in d=2

in this section we study the phase structure of some special cases of gscm in d = 2 with
v =tr(aa)n.

4.1

n = 1 (ym2)

in the weakcoupling regime, eqs.(38) and (39) are linear equations with solutions a =

2  2 and b = 2 + 2, and therefore eq.(33) leads to

(n=1)
w

(z) = q(b  z)(z  a)



= q2  (z  2)2



.

(58)

10

in the strongcoupling regime, eqs.(40) and (41) result a = 1/2   and b = 1/2 + , and
therefore eq.(36) leads to

(n=1)
s

(z) =

z

s b  z
z  a

=

z

s 1 + 6  2z
2z  1 + 2

.

(59)

these equations are the density functions that have been obtained in [11] (note that in this
paper, xis are the eigenvalues of 2aa, but in ref.[11] xis are the eigenvalues of 42aa).
if one computes the internal energies (48) and (49) by using these density functions, it is
seen that

which are the results obtained in [4]. it is obvious from eqs.(60) and (61) that in the case
n = 1, there exists a thirdorder phase transition.

4.2

n = 2 gscm

first consider the weakcoupling regime. the eqs.(38) and (39) give, respectively

5(a3 + b3) + 3ab(a + b) = 163,

and

35(a4 + b4) + 20ab(a2 + b2) + 18a2b2 = 643(a + b + 1).

(64)

these equations can not be solved analytically to obtain a and b, but as we want to study
the phase structure of the model, it is sucient to look at the solutions near the critical
point. therefore we expand the above equations around ac = 0 and bc = 4/3 up to second
order, and then nd a and b in terms of  =   c, again up to second order. the nal
result is

now consider the density function (z) in the weakcoupling regime for an = n,2 and d = 2
(eq.(33)):

(66)

using this function, we calculate (using (48)) the internal energy (per unit link) in the weak
coupling regime

if we substitute the expansions (65) in the above relation, we nd the internal energy in

we can follow the same steps in the strongcoupling regime, this time using eqs.(40), (41),
(36), and (49). the nal results are

the above equation shows that we have a thirdorder phase transition for v =tr(aa)2 of
gscm in d = 2.

4.3

n = 3 and n = 4 gscm

in the case n = 3, bc = 6/5 and c = (3/80)(16)4/5(189)1/5; and in the case n = 4, bc = 8/7
and c = (1/14)31/786/7(143)1/7. the procedure is the same as n = 2 and after some
calculations, we obtain the nal results as following

u (n=3)

(72)

these relations show that for v =tr(aa)3 and tr(aa)4 of gscm in d = 2, the models
exhibit thirdorder phase transition, as in the ym theory. we expect that the same behaviour
exists in all gscm with v =tr(aa)n.

5 conclusion

in this paper the scm was generalized by a method very similar to the method which have
been used in the generalization of ym theories. this generalization may be interesting from
several points of view. first, as mentioned in the introduction, many few matrixmodels
can be solved analytically in the largen limit. gscms are models that can be studied
analytically in this limit. second, the gscm at d = 2 can be treated as the lattice version of
gym theory, which is an important twodimensional candidate of qcd. and third, which
is somehow related to the second, the study of these models (gscm) is much more simple
than the gym. for instance, the proof of the existence of thirdorder phase transition in
f (b) =trb4 gym theory [16], which corresponds to our v =tr(aa)2 model, is more
dicult than the proof which is given in section 4.2.
