abstract.

sigma model actions are constructed for the type ii superstring compactied
to four and six dimensional curved backgrounds which can contain non-vanishing
ramond-ramond elds. these actions are n=2 worldsheet superconformally invariant
and can be covariantly quantized preserving manifest spacetime supersymmetry. they
are constructed using a hybrid version of superstring variables which combines features
of the ramond-neveu-schwarz and green-schwarz formalisms. for the ads2  s 2
and ads3  s 3 backgrounds, these actions dier from the classical greeen-schwarz
actions by a crucial kinetic term for the fermions. parts of this work have been done
in collaborations with m. bershadsky, t. hauer, w. siegel, c. vafa, e. witten, s.
zhukov and b. zwiebach.

quantization of the superstring in ramond-ramond backgrounds

1. introduction

quantization of the superstring in ramond-ramond backgrounds is currently of great
interest because of the ads-cft conjectures. although ramond vertex operators are
well understood using the results of friedan, martinec and shenker [1] for the ramond-
neveu-schwarz (rns) formalism, these vertex operators dier from neveu-schwarz
vertex operators in breaking worldsheet supersymmetry and mixing matter and ghost
variables. without worldsheet supersymmetry as a guiding principle, it is dicult to
guess the correct generalization of these vertex operators for constructing the superstring
action in ramond-ramond backgrounds.

it has been proposed in [2] that spacetime supersymmetry may replace worldsheet
supersymmetry as a guiding principle for constructing the action, e.g.
in determining
the contact terms which are required to eliminate unphysical divergences[3]. however,
spacetime supersymmetry is hard to verify in the rns formalism since the worldsheet
action is only expected to be spacetime-supersymmetric when the background elds are
on-shell. this can be seen from the fact that spacetime supersymmetry transformations
change the picture of a vertex operator, but picture-changing can only be dened when
the vertex operator is physical.

an alternative approach is to use the green-schwarz (gs) formalism for the
superstring where spacetime supersymmetry is manifest. although it is easy to
construct a classical gs action for the superstring in a curved superspace background
including ramond-ramond elds, the existence of fermionic second-class constraints
makes it dicult to quantize this action unless the background admits a light-cone
gauge choice. furthermore, the lack of a fradkin-tseytlin term coupling the dilaton
to worldsheet curvature makes it doubtful that the classical gs action is correct in
arbitrary backgrounds.

the fermionic second-class constraints of the gs formalism are

d = p  im

xm + ... = 0

where (xm, ) are the usual superspace variables, p is the conjugate momentum for ,
m
 are the pauli matrices, and ... refers to terms which are higher order in . siegel
has suggested in [4] a modication of the gs formalism in which the above second class
constraints are replaced by a suitable set of rst-class constraints constructed from d.
in this modied gs formalism, p is treated as an independent worldsheet variable.
although he was unable to nd an appropriate set of rst-class constraints, he argued
on general grounds that the massless open superstring vertex operator should have the
form

v = z dz[y m am (x, ) + d w (x, )]

where y m = (xm, ), am are the superspace gauge elds, and w  are the superspace
eld-strengths.

over the last ve years, a third approach has been developed which combines
advantages of the rns and gs approaches and has therefore been named the hybrid

approach. using a eld redenition which preserves free-eld opes, one can map the
worldsheet matter and ghost rns variables into a set of superspace variables (including
conjugate p variables) plus an internal sector. in fact, part of this map was already
suggested in [1] where it was noticed that since the spacetime-supersymmetry generator
in the  1

where  comes from fermionizing the bosonic ghosts as  = e,  = e and  is
the spin eld of conformal weight 5/8 constructed from the m variables.

unfortunately, these  variables are not all free elds if  = 1 to 16 as can be seen

from the ope

(y)(z)  (y  z)1

m em.

however,
it is possible to choose a subset of these variables which are free elds.
the subset that is most convenient depends on which subgroup of so(9, 1) lorentz
invariance one wants to remain manifest. for example, using u(5) notation, the subset
[+++++, +++] are free elds which leave manifest the subgroup so(3, 1)  u(3).
this choice is most convenient for describing compactications of the superstring to
four dimensions on a calabi-yau three-fold [5][6][7][8]. another choice is the subset
[+++++, +++, +++, +++] which leaves manifest the subgroup so(5, 1)u(2).
this choice is most convenient for describing compactications of the superstring to
six dimensions on a calabi-yau two-fold [9] [10] [11]. a third choice is the subset
[+, +, +, +, +] which leaves manifest a u(5) subgroup of
the wick-rotated so(10) [12].

in section 2, the hybrid formalism for compactication to four dimensions is used
to construct the superstring action in an ads2  s 2 background with ramond-ramond
ux. in section 3, the hybrid formalism for compactication to six dimensions is used
to construct the superstring action in an ads3  s 3 background with ramond-ramond
ux. work is in progress on using the u(5) version of the hybrid formalism to construct
the superstring action in an ads5  s 5 background with ramond-ramond ux.

for

the

c, g

compactications of

superstring which preserve

m as desired for the supersymmetry algebra.

with this choice of picture for the four-dimensional supersymmetry generators,
{q, q } = r dzxm 
four-dimensional
supersymmetry, the six-dimensional compactication manifold can be represented by
a c = 9 n=2 superconformal eld theory whose n=2 generators will be denoted
[tc, g+
c, jc]. up to some minor modications which will be described below, the
compactication manifold in the hybrid formalism is represented by the same c = 9
n=2 superconformal eld theory. for the compactication-dependent worldsheet elds
to have no singular opes with  and  , they need to be twisted by a factor en 
where  =  +  and n is the charge of the eld with respect to jc. for example,
for compactication on a six-torus, the worldsheet elds j = j+3 + ij+6 for j = 1 to
3 are redened to

j  ej,

j  e j

which have no singular opes with  and  . one also needs to redene the c = 9
n=2 generators to be

[tc, g+

c, g

c, jc]  [tc +

3
2

()2  jc, eg+

c, eg

c, jc + 3]

which still generates a c = 9 n=2 algebra.
there is one chiral boson  dened by

 = 3 + cb + 2  jc

which has no singular opes with the other hybrid variables. this is the last free hybrid
variable since the compactication-independent hybrid variables [xm, ,  , p, p , ]
contain the same degrees of freedom as the compactication-independent rns variables
[xm, m, b, c, , , ] where m = 0 to 3. so any vertex operator constructed out of rns
variables can be rewritten in terms of hybrid variables and vice versa.

one now needs to dene the physical state conditions in terms of the hybrid
variables.
in terms of the rns variables, the physical state conditions for a vertex
operator v are qv = qghostv = 0 where qbrst = r dzjbrst is the brst charge and
qghost = r dzjghost is the ghost current. at least for neveu-schwarz integrated vertex
operators in the zero picture, these conditions can be strengthened to require that v has
no poles with jbrst , with jghost, with the b ghost, and with the stress tensor t . after
adding a total derivative to jbrst and dening jghost = bc +  (which is equivalent
to the standard denition jghost = bc +  in the zero picture), one can show that
[t, jbrst , b, jghost] form a twisted n=2 algebra. so the above denition of physical state
conditions implies that v is a u(1)-neutral primary eld with respect to these n=2
generators. note that v has no poles with  since {b, er z
jghost} = {b, c} = . so it is
independent of the  zero mode as desired for rns physical vertex operators.

after performing a similarity transformation on the hybrid variables of the form
c], one nds that these twisted

note that the n=2 generators factorize into a set of four-dimensional n=2 generators

class constraints for d and d  that can replace the second-class constraints of the
four-dimensional gs superstring.

for the open superstring, the massless compactication-independent states are
described by the gluon and gluino of four-dimensional super-yang-mills. as shown
in [5], the integrated vertex operator for these states is given by

v = z dz[y m am + d w  + d  w ]

exactly as proposed in [4] where y m = (xm, ,  ), w  and w  are the chiral and
anti-chiral superspace eld-strengths, and am are the superspace gauge elds. one
can check that in wess-zumino gauge, this vertex operator is mapped to the standard
neveu-schwarz and ramond vertex operators for the gluon and gluino where the weyl
gluino vertex operator is in the  1
2 picture, the gluon vertex operator is in the 0 picture,
and the anti-weyl gluino vertex operator is in the + 1

2 picture.

since the closed superstring vertex operator is the holomorphic square of the open
superstring vertex operator, one obtains the following integrated vertex operator for the
massless compactication-independent states of the type ii superstring [7]:

s = z d2z[y m y n (gm n + bm n ) + da y n ea

where y m = (xm, ,  ,  ,

superelds gmn, bmn, ea
gravitini, and the ramond-ramond bispinor eld-strength.

to get the superstring action in a curved background, one simply interprets the
m , f ab] appearing in s as background superelds. this
superelds [gm n , bm n , ea
action is manifestly super-reparameterization invariant and is expected to be invariant
under n=2 worldsheet superconformal transformations when the background elds
satisfy the appropriate equations of motion. note that the rst term in s is the usual
gs action in a curved background, but the other terms in s proportional to da and da
are required for quantization since they provide kinetic terms for the fermions.

of

the

course,

complete action also contains a contribution from the
compactication-dependent elds but, at string tree-level, one can consistently choose
the four-dimensional background superelds to be compactication-independent. so
the compactication-dependent contribution can be chosen to be the same as in the at
four-dimensional case. one also needs an action for the chiral boson , but this term
similarly decouples from the four-dimensional background. finally, one needs to add a
fradkin-tseytlin term to the action to couple the dilaton to worldsheet curvature. as
discussed in [7], this term can be constructed using chiral and twisted-chiral spacetime
and worldsheet superelds. although it has not yet been checked for the type ii
superstring that n=2 worldsheet superconformal invariance at one-loop sigma model
implies the expected superspace equations of motion for the background superelds,
this has been checked for an analogous sigma model action for the heterotic superstring
[14].

to obtain the action for the superstring in an ads2  s 2 background with constant
ramond-ramond ux f ab = ab, one simply plugs the appropriate values for the
background elds into the action. because da and da are auxiliary elds in the presence
of constant ramond-ramond ux, they can be integrated out to produce the action

where (j a, j a) and j c are the eight fermionic currents and four bosonic currents (g1dg)a
constructed from a coset supergroup g taking values in p su(1, 1|2)/u(1)  u(1) [8].
the rst line of this action comes from the y m y n (gm n +bm n ) term and is therefore
identical to the gs action on ads2  s 2 [15][16]. however, the second line of this action
is crucial for quantization and is absent from the gs action. using standard techniques,
it was conrmed to one-loop sigma model in [8] that the above action is conformally
invariant as expected.

p = [e

to be fundamental variables where  = 1 to 4. for compactications of the superstring
which preserve six-dimensional supersymmetry, the four-dimensional compactication
manifold can be represented by a c = 6 n=2 superconformal eld theory whose
n=2 generators will be denoted [tc, g+
c, jc]. as before, for the compactication-
dependent worldsheet elds to have no singular opes with  and  , they need to be

c, g

quantization of the superstring in ramond-ramond backgrounds

twisted by a factor en  where  =  +  and n is the charge of the eld with respect
to jc. furthermore, the c = 6 n=2 generators need to be redened as

[tc, g+

c, g

c, jc]  [tc + 2  jc, eg+

c, eg

c, jc + 2]

which still generates a c = 6 n=2 algebra.

there are two chiral bosons,  and , dened by

 = 2    jc,

 = ibc

which have no singular opes with the other elds. since [xm, , p, , ] contain
the same degrees of
freedom as the compactication-independent rns variables
[xm, m, b, c, , ] where m = 0 to 5, any vertex operator constructed out of rns
variables can be rewritten in terms of hybrid variables and vice versa. after performing a
similarity transformation on the hybrid variables, the twisted n=2 generators described
in the previous section are mapped to

24 epppp, xm has been written in bispinor notation as x =

(m)(n) + (n)(m) = 2mn


with (m) dened as (m) = 1

2 (m).

although physical vertex operators can be dened as u(1)-neutral primary elds
with respect to the above n=2 generators, they would not be manifestly spacetime-
supersymmetric since they depend on only half of the usual eight j variables of six-
dimensional superspace where j = . if one calls  =  where  is dened above,
the complex conjugates + are missing. to make all six-dimensional supersymmetries
manifest, one therefore needs to add + to the hybrid variables, as well as their
conjugate momentum p+. since these variables are not related by a eld redenition to
rns variables, one needs to simultaneously introduce new fermionic gauge invariances
which allow + and p+ to be gauged away [11]. these new variables will be dened to
have no singular opes with the other elds and to satisfy +(y)p+(z)  (y  z)1
 .

the fermionic gauge invariances will be generated by the rst-class constraints

d = d+  eid = 0

quantization of the superstring in ramond-ramond backgrounds

where d = p and d+ = p+  ix + 1
8+. since {d, +} = 
,
this gauge invariance can be used to x + = 0 and the constraint then xes
p+ = eip + ix. furthermore, the n=2 constraints can be modied to
commute with the d constraints by dening

where d(y ) denotes the contour integral of d around y . one can check that these
n=2 constraints agree with the ones dened earlier in the gauge + = 0. these n=2
generators, together with the d constraints, provide rst-class constraints for dj that
can replace the second-class constraints of the six-dimensional gs superstring.

for the open superstring, the massless compactication-independent states are
described by the gluon and gluino of six-dimensional super-yang-mills. as shown in
[5], the integrated vertex operator for these states is given by

v = z dz[y m am + dj w j]

exactly as predicted by siegel where y m = (xm, j), w j is the superspace eld-
strength, and am are the superspace gauge elds. in wess-zumino gauge when + = 0,
this vertex operator is mapped to the standard neveu-schwarz and ramond vertex
operators for the gluon and gluino where the gluino vertex operator with polarization
w  is in the  1
2 picture, the gluon vertex operator is in the 0 picture, and the gluino
vertex operator with polarization w + is in the + 1

2 picture [11].

since the closed superstring vertex operator is the holomorphic square of the open
superstring vertex operator, one obtains the following integrated vertex operator for the
massless compactication-independent states of the type ii superstring:

s = z d2z[y m y n (gm n + bm n ) + dj y n ej

n + y m d je j

m + djd kf j k]

where y m = (xm, j,  j),  j is the right-moving analog of the left-moving j, and
m , f j k are the graviton,
the lowest components of the superelds gmn, bmn, ej
the anti-symmetric tensor, the two gravitini, and the ramond-ramond bispinor eld
strengths.

m , e j

to get the superstring action in a curved background, one again interprets the
m , f j k] appearing in s as background superelds.
superelds [gm n , bm n , ej
this action is manifestly super-reparameterization invariant and is expected to be
n=2 worldsheet superconformally invariant when the background elds satisfy the
appropriate equations of motion. the rst term in s is the usual gs action in

m , e j

quantization of the superstring in ramond-ramond backgrounds

a curved background, but the other terms in s proportional to dj and d j are
required for quantization. the complete action also contains a contribution from the
compactication-dependent elds, from the chiral bosons, and from a fradkin-tseytlin
term constructed in a manner similar to that of the four-dimensional action [11].

to obtain the action for the superstring in an ads3  s 3 background with constant
ramond-ramond ux f j k = jk , there are two approaches. the rst approach
[11] resembles the four-dimensional case where one simply plugs the appropriate values
for the background elds into the action. after integrating out dj and d j, one obtains
the action

jkj k(j j

sads = z d2z[cdj c

where (j j, j k) and j c are the sixteen fermionic currents and six bosonic currents
(g1dg)a constructed from a coset supergroup g taking values in p su(1, 1|2) 
p su(2|2)/su(2)su(2). the rst line of this action comes from the y m y n (gm n +
bm n ) term and is therefore identical to the gs action on ads3  s 3 [15][17]. however,
the second line of this action is crucial for quantization and is absent from the gs
action. using standard techniques, it was conrmed to one-loop sigma model in [8] that
the above action is conformally invariant as expected.

a second approach for constructing the action on ads3  s 3 is to rst use the
d and d  constraints to solve for d+ and d  and to gauge-x half of the fermionic
parameters of the coset supergroup. after integrating out the remaining d and d +
variables, one obtains the action [10]

sads = z d2z[cdj c

z j d

z  (1  ei+ +i)1(j

where (j , j +) and j c are the eight fermionic and six bosonic left-invariant currents
(g1dg)a constructed from a supergroup g taking values in p su(2|2). it was proven to
all orders in sigma model loops that this action is conformally invariant [10].
