the kaluza-klein spectrum of d = 5 simple supergravity compactied on s 3 is
studied. a classical background solution which preserves maximal supersymmetry is
fullled by the geometry of ads2  s 3. the physical spectrum of the uctuations is
classied according to su (1, 1|2) su (2) symmetry, which has a very similar structure
to that for the case of compactication on ads3  s 2.

1. introduction maldacenas conjecture [1] is one of the most attractive subjects among

recent progress in the non-perturbative string/m-theory. in this paper, we consider d = 5

simple supergravity (sugra) with 0-brane solution whose near-horizon geometry is the
direct product of two-dimensional anti-de-sitter space and three-sphere (ads2  s3), and
investigate its kaluza-klein spectrum. assuming the ads2/cf t1 correspondence to hold
[2]-[5], we show that the spectrum possesses su (1, 1|2)  su (2) symmetry.
it must be
remarked that gauntlett et.al.[6] has recently evinced the super-poincare group of ads2s3
sugra to be su (1, 1|2)  su (2). our results provide each kaluza-klein mode with the
precise assignment to the certain representation of su (1, 1|2)  su (2).

on the other hand, d = 5 simple sugra possesses very similar structure to that

of d = 11 sugra [7]-[10].

in particular, the former theory allows solitonic string (1-

brane) and particle (0-brane) solutions that respectively correspond to m5- and m2-brane

solutions in the latter [11]. the near-horizon geometry of the solitonic string in d = 5
simple sugra is ads3  s2. in the previous work [12], the kaluza-klein spectrum in this
ads3  s2 compactication is studied and its su (1, 1|2)  su (1, 1) symmetry is found,
which can be regarded as the nite-dimensional subalgebra of n = (4, 0), namely right- and

left-moving, superconformal algebra. interestingly enough, two dierent compactications
are endowed with quite similar symmetries, su (1, 1|2)  su (1, 1) and su (1, 1|2)  su (2).
it is a sign of the electromagnetic duality between ads3 s2 and ads2 s3 simple sugra
theories.

the above equation of motion enjoys freund-rubin-like solutions [13] that preserve the

maximal number of the supersymmetry after three-dimensional compactication. one of

such solutions over which we will be considering the kaluza-klein spectrum possesses the
geometry of ads2  s3, namely

to diagonalize the mass matrices derived from the above equation, we adopt the spherical
harmonics on s3 with the rank 0,1 and 2.
it is well-known that the isometry group of
s3, so(4), is decomposed into a direct product of two su (2)s, namely su (2)  su (2).
therefore, we are able to use spins of two su (2)s to classify the kaluza-klein spectrum.
2
let ~j 2 (~j
) denote the casimir operator of su (2) (su (2)) with eigenvalues j(j+1) (j(j+1))
for j, j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2,. (j) ( (j)) means a representation of su (2) (su (2)) with spin
j (j). with these preparations, we can represent the spherical harmonics on s3 with the

rank 0, 1 and 2 as follows.

1. scalar harmonics

first, for scalar functions on s3, one can easily conrm the equality of the two su (2)
casimir operators and the three-dimensional laplacian  = mm,

  = 4 ~j 2 = 4~j

2

.

(12)

furthermore, it is immediately shown that a product y (k) = (k/2) (k/2) is a scalar
on s3 and, besides, an eigenfunction of the laplacian. in fact, the eigenvalue of  is
given by k(k + 2) = 4j(j + 1) = 4j(j + 1), where k = 2j = 2j = 0, 1, 2,.

2. vector harmonics

one can prove that y (k,)
2 ) is a vector function on s3 and an eigen-
function of the laplacian with the eigenvalue  = k(k + 2)  1 for k = 1, 2, 3,.
3mnpvp;n, we should
introducing the rotational derivative for vector elds (rot v)m = e

2 ) ( k1

= ( k1

m

remark that

rot y (k,)

m

= (k + 1)y (k,)

m

.

(13)

3. tensor harmonics
similarly, y (k,)
the eigenvalue  = k(k + 2)  2 for k = 2, 3, 4,.

mn = ( k2

2 ) ( k2

2 ) has spin 2 on s3 and is an eigenfunction of  with

now we are ready to calculate the eigenvalues of the mass matrices for the bosonic elds.

the so(4)-charge is inherited from the used spherical harmonic with a certain rank. the

results are indicated in the following.

3

1. rank 0 the eigenvalues of the dalembertian  of ads2 are

2 =  = k2  2k,

k2 + 6k + 8

(k = 0, 1, 2,).

(14)

although 2 = k2  2k takes a negative value 1 at k = 1, it is still admissible
since the value does not violate the stability of ads space [14]. the so(4)-charges

corresponding to both of the above two branches prove identically

2. rank 1 let us remark that the mass matrices take dierent forms for y (k,+)

m

or y (k,)

m

.

(j, j) = ( k

2 , k

2 ).

(15)

the results are

2 = k2 + 8k + 15,

k2  1 (k = 1, 2, 3,),

(j, j) = ( k+1

2 , k1

2 ),

or

2 = k2  4k + 3,
2 ).

(j, j) = ( k1

2 , k+1

k2 + 4k + 3

(k = 1, 2, 3,),

(16)

(17)

the tower with 2 = k2  4k + 3 has a negative value at k = 2. this is also acceptable
for the same reason as that for the case of rank 0 discussed above.

3. rank 2

for both of

2 = k2 + 2k (k = 2, 3, 4,),

(j, j) = ( k2

2 , k2

2 ).

(18)

(19)

4. kaluza-klein spectrum: fermionic modes the fermionic uctuation around the
ads2  s3 background, m = 0, is labeled by simply m itself. its linearized equation of
motion is drawn from the lagrangian (2):

im n p p ;n 

3
4

i(m n p q + 2 g m [p g q]n )n f



p q = 0.

(20)

to analyze the kaluza-klein spectrum from (20), we utilize the spinor spherical harmonic
m on s3 which is an eigenspinor of the dirac equation

nnm + mnn =  m.

4

(21)

expanding the spinor m by using the vector (or rank 1) harmonics and the killing spinors
with the help of the gauge xing m m = 0, the eigenvalue  becomes

 = k 
 = k 

5
2
1
2

,

(k = 1, 2, 3),
k +

1
2
(k = 1, 2, 3).

k 

3
2

(k = 2, 3, 4)

(22)

(23)

the rst two towers satisfy the gamma-traceless condition, mm = 0, which is the condition
for |j  j| = 3/2, while the other two ones do not. moreover, the tower with  = k  1/2
is absent at k = 1 because one can show that for that tower, m = 0 at k = 1 by using its

explicit form.

in order to assign the so(4)-charge to each mode, one must remember that the eigen-
spinors are expanded by the product of the vector harmonics with so(4)-charge (k/2 
1/2, k/2  1/2) and the killing spinors with (1/2, 0) or (0, 1/2). those spinors have two
chiralities, 1, for r4 in which s3 is embedded. however, in macroscopic view of the space-
time ads2, these chiralities are not visible. in this sense, each tower is only recognized as

being doubly degenerated.

now let us explicitly decompose the products of the vector harmonics and the killing
spinors into a direct sum of the irreducible representations of su (2)  su (2). the result is
quite simple:

( k+1

2 , k1

2 )  ( 1

2 , 0)  ( k+1
= ( k+2

2 , k1
2 , k1

2 )  (0, 1
2 )
2 , k2
2 )  ( k+1

2 )  ( k

2 , k1

2 )  ( k+1

2 , k

2 ).

(24)

the representation as ( k+1

2 , k2

2 ) starts from k = 2 while the others from k = 1. the

so(4)-charge to each mode is assigned as follows:

2

 = k  5
 = k  1
 = k  1
 = k + 3
2

2

2

(k = 1, 2, 3)  ( k+2
(k = 2, 3, 4)  ( k+1
(k = 1, 2, 3)  ( k
(k = 1, 2, 3)  ( k+1

2 , k1
2 )
2 , k2
2 )
2 , k1
2 )
2 , k
2 ).

(25)

5. symmetry of the spectrum let us classify the acquired kaluza-klein spectrum by a

certain symmetry group. by considering the poincare group consisting of the isometry and
supercharge, the symmetry of the modes is shown to be the superalgebra su (1, 1|2)su (2)
[6]. we should remark that the bosonic part of su (1, 1|2)  su (2) is su (1, 1)  su (2) 
su (2) = so(1, 2)  so(4), which is nothing but the product of the isometry group of

5

ads2 and that of s3. moreover, su (1, 1|2) is a nite-dimensional subalgebra of n = 4
super-virasoro algebra with su (2). the oscillator representations [15], which is very help-
ful to visualize the representations, of su (1, 1|2) has already appeared in the analysis of
the kaluza-klein spectrum on ads3  s3 and also ads3  s2 [16]-[20].

assuming that this sugra is coupled to a one-dimensional conformal eld theory

(cf t1) at the boundary of ads2, we can translate each kaluza-klein mode into a conformal

weight  by means of wittens formula [21]

1 + 1 + 2

2

.

 =

(26)

hence we can make the following table:

scalar

k2  2k
k2  1

k2 + 8k + 15

on the other hand, we can carry on the same mapping for the spin- 1

2 elds by using

(20):

 =

1

2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

1

2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) +

(27)

the table for spin- 1

we have already mentioned that all fermionic modes are doubly degenerated owing to the
unobservable chiralities for r4.

6

the last step is to t these results into the representations of su (1, 1|2)  su (2) =
su (1, 1)  su (2)  su (2). in [12], we dealt with the su (1, 1|2)r  su (1, 1)l chiral sym-
metry. upon replacing su (1, 1)l by su (2), we nally conrm that all kaluza-klein modes
fall into four supermultiplets of su (1, 1|2)  su (2) in the similar manner to the case of
ads3s2. every spectrum obeying this single su (1, 1|2)su (2) symmetry is summarized
in figs. 1-4. in those four gures, one of the two su (2)-charges, namely j is xed at a
certain value. for example, the elds with the same j = k/2 and |j  j| = 0, 1/2, and 1 are
gathered in fig.1. in each gure, one can notice a multiplet-shortening very similar to that

for chiral primary elds in two-dimensional n = 4 superconformal theories.

it is remarkable that two dierent compactications, ads3s2 and ads2s3, are char-
acterized by closely related superalgebras, su (1, 1|2)  su (1, 1) and su (1, 1|2)  su (2),
respectively, each of which allows short representations. as is discussed in [3], the su (1, 1)

isometry of ads2 can be enlarged to a single innite-dimensional virasoro symmetry at the

boundary similarly to that in ads3/cf t2 case [22]. this single (super-)virasoro algebra

has been explicitly constructed in the study of conformal mechanics that describes the be-

havior of a test particle near the horizon of a four-dimensional extreme reissner-nordstrom

black hole [2]. it would be interesting to explore the relation between the conformal me-
chanics and ads2  s3 simple sugra.
