abstract

in the previous paper [hep-th/9904129], we constructed a general explicit

bps solution for (f, d3) non-threshold bound state. by using the sl(2,z)

symmetry of type iib string theory, we here construct from (f, d3) a more

general bps conguration for a d3 brane with certain units of quantized

5-form ux and an innite number of parallel (f, d1)-strings. we study its

decoupling limit and nd that given maldacenas ads5/cf t4 correspondence

with respect to simple d3 branes and with the usual string coupling, we should

have a similar correspondence with respect to this bound state but now with

an eective string coupling. we discuss possible descendants of this bound

state by t-dualities along its longitudinal or transverse directions. in partic-

ular, we present explicit congurations for ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) bound states

for 2  p  5. all these congurations preserve one half of the spacetime
supersymmetries.

1

i. introduction

in the previous paper [1], we showed that for the non-threshold bound state (f, d3) the

dilaton in general does not remain constant as opposed to a simple d3 brane conguration,

even though in both cases one half of the spacetime supersymmetries are preserved. however,

the dilaton was still found to be bounded from below by its asymptotic value and from above

by its nite horizon value. the eective string coupling, dened as ge = e, decreases its

value when we move from asymptotic region to the horizon region. this is caused by the

innite number of f-strings in the bound state. in the so-called decoupling limit, this bound

state is expected to be described either by elds in the bulk spacetime or by the n = 4 u(n)
sym theory in 1 + 3 dimensions (with n the 5-form charge associated with the 3-brane in (f,

d3)). in the bulk, we need to study only the near-horizon region under this limit. we found
that the near-horizon string metric of (f, d3) is not automatically ads5  s5 but under
some constant rescalings of the coordinates it becomes ads5s5. the resulting metric then
becomes identical with the near-horizon geometry of an equivalent simple d3 brane with

5-form charge n with the eective string coupling evaluated at the horizon rather than the

usual string coupling. following the symmetry argument of maldacena [2], we mentioned

that we must have an ads5/cf t4 correspondence with respect to this eective vacuum

conguration of the equivalent simple d3 brane. the gauge coupling for the sym theory

becomes related to the eective string coupling rather than the usual string coupling as

g2
ym = 2ge.

after the rescalings of the coordinates, the information about the f-strings in the (f,

d3) in the metric disappeared completely. the only dierence between the equivalent simple

d3 brane with the usual simple d3 brane just mentioned is the string coupling constant.

so the eect of the f-strings must be encoded into this eective string coupling. indeed,

we found that the tension for this equivalent simple d3 brane is nothing but the tension for

the (f, d3) bound state. this indicates that the eective vacuum mentioned above is just

the (f, d3) bound state. the vacuum conguration for the sym theory in that case does

2

not contain the electric ux lines. we also found that the eect of the electric ux lines in

the worldvolume picture of the (f, d3) bound state gets absorbed into the gauge coupling

constant g2

ym = 2ge. therefore, we had a consistent picture both in the bulk and on the

brane.

thus the ads5/cf t4 correspondence of maldacena was found to hold true even for this

non-trivial d3 brane conguration, namely, (f, d3) but with the corresponding eective

string coupling rather than the usual string coupling. we also observed that the eective

string coupling is quantized in terms of the integral charges associated with the f-strings

and the d3 brane in the (f, d3) bound state. in particular, it can be independent of the

usual string coupling in certain limit.

in testing maldacenas ads5/cf t4 conjecture, most of the current activities are focused
on relating the perturbative particle-like modes of type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 with
the operators of the boundary n = 4 sym theory. in [1], we took a dierent step in relating
non-trivial (non-perturbative) (f, d3) conguration in the bulk to the corresponding one in

sym on the boundary. actually, there already exist some eorts [47] in this direction, for

example, in [6,7] certain eects of d-instantons of type iib theory in the decoupling limit

have been checked to match with those of the instantons in ym theory on the boundary.

in this paper, we continue our study for a more general d3 brane conguration, namely,

the non-threshold ((f, d1), d3) bound state. we construct this conguration explicitly in

the following section by using the type iib sl(2,z) symmetry and the (f, d3) conguration

given in [1]. in section 3, we study the properties of this ((f, d1), d3) bound state. in

section 4, we study the decoupling limit of this bound state. we nd that the ads5/cf t4

correspondence holds true in the same spirit as in [2] for this ((f, d1), d3) bound states

but once again with the corresponding eective string coupling rather than the usual string

coupling. in particular, we perform a non-trivial check of this correspondence by showing

that the gauge coupling and theta angle obtained from the corresponding n = 4 sym are
indeed related to the eective string coupling and value of the rr scalar evaluated at the

horizon, as required by the correspondence. the eective string coupling is also quantized

3

as in [1] in terms of integral charges associated with the f-strings, d-strings and d3 brane

in the ((f, d1), d3) bound state. interestingly, we nd that d-strings in the ((f, d1), d3)

tend to increase the eective string coupling while the f-strings tend to decrease it. this is

also true for the value of the rr scalar evaluated at the horizon. in section 5, we present

all possible descendants of this ((f, d1), d3) bound state by t-dualities. we also discuss

some bps states which can be obtained by the type iib sl(2,z) acting on the descendants

of the ((f, d1), d3) in the non-perturbative type iib string theory. in particular, we nd

non-threshold (dp, dp) bound states for 1  p  8, where the two dps share (p  1)
common directions. we also nd non-threshold (dp, dp, dp) bound states for 1  p  7,
where the three dps share (p 1) directions; non-threshold (dp, dp, dp, dp) bound states
for 1  p  6, where the four dps share also (p  1) common directions and so on. this
can be continued until we reach a seemingly unique non-threshold (d1, d1, d1, d1, d1,

d1, d1, d1, d1) bound state with the nine d1s sharing no common direction. all these

bound states preserve one half of the spacetime supersymmetries. we discuss the possible

role of these bound states in the m- or u-theory. we also present the explicit congurations

for the ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) bound states for 2  p  5. finally, we conclude this paper in
section 6.

ii. non-threshold ((f, d1), d3) bound state

in this section, we will construct the non-threshold ((f, d1), d3) bound state using

the type iib sl(2,z) symmetry and the (f, d3) solution given in [1]. we will follow the

procedure outlined in [8,9]. we take the initial conguration as (f, d3) solution, with

vanishing asymptotic values for all non-vanishing elds. this is given by the following

einstein metric,

ds2 = (h h)1/4hh 1(cid:16)(dx0)2 + (dx1)2(cid:17) + h 1(cid:16)(dx2)2 + (dx3)2(cid:17) + dyidyii ,

(2.1)

with i = 1,   , 6; the dilaton,

4

e =   h 

h !1/2

,

and the remaining non-vanishing elds,

h (1)
3 = m 1/2
h (2)
3 = m n 1

h5 = n

(m,n) dh 1  dx0  dx1,
(m,n) h 2 dh  dx2  dx3,

5

(5 + 5) .

(2.2)

(2.3)

in the above, h (1)
3

and h (2)
3

are the nsns and rr 3-form eld strengths, respectively, and

they form a doublet

h3 = 


h (1)
3
h (2)
3




,

(2.4)

under the classical sl(2,r) symmetry of type iib string theory. h5 is the self-dual 5-form

eld strength which is inert under either sl(2,r) or sl(2,z). h is a harmonic function

h = 1 +

q3
r4 ,

(2.5)

with r2  yiyi and q3 = 1/2
as,

(m,n)20q3

0/(45), h  is a second harmonic function dened

h  = 1 +

n2q3/(m,n)

r4

.

also in the above, the -factor has the form,

(m,n) = m2 + n2,

(2.6)

(2.7)

where the asymptotic values of the scalars have been set to zero. here n is the quantized

5-form ux or 3-brane charge and m is the quantized ns string charge or the number of

f-strings through a (2)2 area of the 2-dimensional plane perpendicular to the strings in

(f, d3) as discussed in [1]. m and n are relatively prime integers. unless stated otherwise, 
always denotes the hodge dual. n denotes the volume form on an n-sphere and the volume

of a unit n-sphere is

5

n =

2(n+1)/2

((n + 1)/2)

.

in the above 20 = (2)7/22 and qp

0 is the unit charge for a dp-brane dened as,

qp
0  (2)(72p)/2(3p)/2.

(2.8)

(2.9)

it is well-known that type iib supergravity possesses a classical sl(2,r) symmetry [10]

and a discrete subgroup sl(2,z) of this group is now believed [11] to survive as a quantum

symmetry of the non-perturbative type iib string theory. under a global sl(2,r) transfor-

mation , we have the following transformations for the einstein metric g, the 3-form eld

strength doublet h, the 5-form eld strength h5 and the scalar matrix m parameterizing
the coset sl(2,r)/so(2) as

g  g, m  mt , h  (1)th, h5  h5,

(2.10)

where the sl(2,r)/so(2) coset scalar matrix is dened as,

m = e

(2.11)

with , the dilaton and , the axion (or rr scalar) in type iib supergravity.

since there are an innite number of (f, d1)-strings in ((f, d1), d3), as discussed in

[1], the corresponding charges for f-strings and d-strings should be calculated according to

e(i) =

1

20 zr2s 5(cid:16)mij  h (j)

3  ijb(j)

2  h5(cid:17) ,

(2.12)

where i, j = 1, 2 and ij is the totally antisymmetric sl(2,r) invariant tensor with 12 = 1. in

general, e(i) are innite because of the innite number of f-strings and d-strings in ((f, d1),

d3). as discussed in [1], the following quantities q(i) are nevertheless nite and quantized,

q(i)  (2)2

e(i)

20a2

,

(2.13)

where a2 = r dx2dx3 is the coordinate area of the x2x3-plane. the quantities q(1) and q(2)

represent charges associated with the f-strings and d-strings or the number of f-strings and

6

d-strings through a (2)2 area over the x2x3-plane measured in some units. from eqs.
(2.12) and (2.10), we nd that the charge doublet qt = (q(1), q(2)) will transform under an
sl(2,r) transformation as

q  q.

(2.14)

we will use the above transformations eqs. (2.10) and (2.14) to obtain the non-threshold

((f, d1), d3) conguration from the given initial (f, d3) solution eqs.(2.1)(2.7). since

the 5-form eld strength is inert under the sl(2,r) transformation, we expect that the

expression for h5 given in eq. (2.3) remains unchanged.

in other words, the integer n

remains the same. however, the integral ns-string charge m must be changed under the

sl(2,r) transformation . in general, it cannot remain as an integer, i.e, quantized. for

this reason, one either needs to introduce a compensating factor for m by hand [8] or take

the initial conguration with an arbitrary classical charge 1/2

(p,q) [9] in place of m such

that the resulting ns-string and d-string charges can be quantized. the process of charge

quantization also determines this factor in terms of the quantized ns-string and rr-string

charges and the asymptotic values of the dilaton and the axion. we will choose the latter

approach, i.e., we take the integer m as an arbitrary classical charge 1/2

(p,q) in the above (f,

d3) solution.

as usual, we start with the zero asymptotic values of  and , i.e., m0 = i, with i the
unit matrix. here m0 denotes the scalar matrix m when the scalars take their asymptotic
values. we now seek a 2  2 sl(2,r) matrix 0 which maps the zero asymptotic values of
 and  to 0 and 0 (which are arbitrary but given) as

0 = 0t

(2.16)

imposing charge quantization on q(i) as q(1) = p, q(2) = q with p, q relatively prime

p

(2.17)

the above equation xes not only the sl(2,r) matrix 0 completely but also the (p,q)-factor

in terms of p, q and 0, 0 as

0 =

and

(p,q) = e0 (p  0 q)2 + e0q2,

(2.18)

(2.19)

which is invariant under an sl(2,z) transformation. note that in this process the so(2)

angle  gets xed as ei = h(p  0q)e0/2 + iqe0/2i 1/2

(p,q) .

once we have the sl(2,r) matrix 0 (eq. (2.18)), we can obtain a general ((f, d1), d3)

conguration by performing the sl(2,r) transformation as given in eq. (2.10) with  = 0

on the initial (f, d3) conguration given in eqs.(2.1)(2.7), with m replaced by 1/2

(p,q). this

conguration is characterized in terms of the quantized charges p and q associated with the

f-strings and d-strings, the quantized charge n of the d3 brane, and arbitrary but given

asymptotic values 0 and 0 of the dilaton  and the axion , respectively. thus, we have

the following explicit conguration of the bound state ((f, d1), d3). the 5-form h5 remains

unchanged, as given in eq. (2.3). the einstein metric ds2 and the harmonic functions h

and h  all remain the same in forms as before, but the (m,n)-factor given in eq. (2.7),

which appears in the harmonic functions, is changed to

(p,q,n) = (p,q) + n2,

= (p  0 q)2 e0 + q2 e0 + n2,

(2.20)

which is also invariant under sl(2,z) as expected since n is inert under sl(2,z). the dilaton

is now

8

e = e0 h 
h h 

,

and the axion is

 =

0h  + (h  h )pqe0/ (p,q)

h 

.

in the above, we have introduced a third harmonic function h  as

(2.21)

(2.22)

h  = 1 +

(n2 + q2 e0)q3/(p,q,n)

r4

,

(2.23)

(p,q,n)20q3

where q3 = 1/2

0/(45). as expected, both the dilaton and the axion approach
their respective asymptotic values as r  . finally, the nsns and rr 3-form eld
strengths are

h (1)
3 = e0 (p  0 q) 1/2
3 = h0 (p  0 q)e0  q e0i 1/2
h (2)

(p,q,n)dh 1  dx0  dx1

(p,q,n)h 2dh  dx2  dx3,

+ p n1

(p,q,n)h 2dh  dx2  dx3.

(2.24)

in the following section, we will study certain properties of this conguration.

iii. properties of ((f, d1), d3) bound state

by construction, we know that the conguration of ((f, d1), d3) given in the previous

section carries one (p, q)-string along the x1-axis per (2)2 area over the x2x3-plane. there

are p f-strings and q d-strings in the (p, q)-string. this non-threshold bound state also

carries the 5-form charge n.

we would like to mention that in constructing the sl(2,z) invariant ((f, d1), d3)

bound state solution of type iib theory, we have chosen the einstein-frame metric to be

asymptotically minskowski. however, since we are here studying strings and dp branes in

string theory, it would be natural to choose the string-frame metric to be asymptotically

minkowski instead. moreover, we need to calculate the tension for this bound state and

9

compare it with the corresponding worldvolume result where the string-frame metric is al-

ways chosen to be asymptotically minkowski in the context of string theory. also, usually in

discussing the so-called decoupling limit, the string-frame metric is chosen to be asymptoti-

cally minkowski. for these reasons, we re-express the explicit solution given in the previous

section in terms of such a choice for the asymptotic metric1. for this choice the 5-form

eld strength continues to be given by the expression in eq. (2.3). the dilaton and the

axion also remain the same as given by eqs. (2.21) and (2.22), respectively. the same is
true for the harmonic functions h, h  and h  but with the replacements q3  e30/2q3,
n2 q3/(p,q,n)  n2e0/2q3/(p,q,n), and (n2 +q2 e0)q3/(p,q,n)  (n2 +q2)e0/2q3/(p,q,n)
in the respective harmonic functions. here the (p,q,n) is also changed to

(p,q,n) = (p  0 q)2 e0 + (q2 + n2) e0,

(3.1)

which is not manifestly sl(2,z) invariant now. apart from an overall constant factor e0/2

and the changes in the corresponding harmonic functions h and h  mentioned above, the

einstein-frame metric eq.(2.1) remains the same in form. the nsns and rr 3-form eld

strengths are now changed to

h (1)
3 = e0/2 (p  0 q) 1/2
3 = e0/2h0 (p  0 q)e0  q e0i 1/2
h (2)
(p,q,n)h 2dh  dx2  dx3,

(p,q,n)dh 1  dx0  dx1  e0q n 1
(p,q,n)dh 1  dx0  dx1

(p,q,n)h 2dh  dx2  dx3,

+e0p n1

(3.2)

where (p,q,n) is given by eq. (3.1).

we can now calculate the mass per unit 3-brane volume for this bound state with the

new einstein-frame metric using the generalized formula given in [1]. we therefore nd the

tension for the ((f, d1), d3) bound state as

1actually there are some rationality behind the choice of the string-frame metric to be asymptot-

ically minkowski and relating such a choice to the sl(2,z) symmetry of type iib theory. we will

give a detail account of this along with other things in a separate paper.

10

t3(p, q, n) =

t 3
0

g qn2 + q2 + g2 (p  0q)2,

(3.3)

which, for 0 = 0, agrees precisely with what we obtained from the worldvolume study in

[3].

the expression for tension in (3.3) clearly shows that the spacetime ((f, d1), d3) bound

state should be identied with the bound state consisting of d3 branes carrying quantized

constant electric and magnetic elds given in [3] based on the worldvolume study. in other

words, the (p, q)-strings should be identied with the quantized electric and magnetic ux

lines. the quantized constant electric and magnetic elds are related to each other by the

sl(2,z) symmetry in the n = 4 sym theory on the worldvolume. this is directly linked to
the type iib sl(2,z) relating f-strings and d-strings in the (p, q)-string provided we identify

the gauge coupling and the -angle in the gauge theory with the string coupling and the

asymptotic value of the axion as

iv. the decoupling limit of ((f, d1), d3) bound state

let us now study the decoupling limit for this ((f, d1), d3) bound state. under this

limit,

g2
ym = 2g = xed,

u =

r
 = xed,

  0,

(4.1)

we know that the modes propagating on the 3-brane worldvolume decouple from the modes

propagating in the bulk spacetime. also since   0 is a low-energy limit, the modes

2our convention for the complex gauge coupling follows from the born-infeld action which diers

from the standard one for su (n) theories by a factor 2. we thank juan maldacena for discussion

on this issue.

11

propagating on the brane are just the massless ones of the open strings. therefore, d3

brane is described by the n = 4 sym theory. it is also described by the elds in the bulk.
so we have two equivalent descriptions for the d3 brane.

from the spacetime point of view, the decoupling limit tells us that we need to study

only the near-horizon geometry. under this limit, the dilaton, which denes the eective

string coupling ge, is given as,

ge  e = e0

1 + q2/n2

(1 + [q2 + e20(p  0q)2]/n2)1/2 ,

and the string-frame metric, in terms of this ge, is

(4.3)

we are looking for an equivalent simple d3-brane description for this ((f, d1), d3) in the

up with

(4.4)

this metric has the isometries of ads5  s5 but not in the standard form because of the
factor (1 + q2/n2). the metric in (4.4) therefore describes the near-horizon geometry of a

simple d3 brane with 5-form ux n but with the string coupling given by ge rather than

the usual string coupling g = e0. the extra factor (1 + q2/n2) in the above metric indicates

that unlike the f-strings, the presence of d-strings in d3 brane worldvolume changes the

entire d3 brane worldvolume metric. this factor does not play an important role in the

near-horizon metric eq. (4.4) but it does have inuence on the asymptotic metric of the

equivalent simple d3 brane as we will explain below.

in the decoupling limit, d-brane

12

picture implies that this equivalent simple d3 brane is also described by the n = 4 u(n)
sym theory in 1 + 3 dimensions with the gauge coupling g2
ym = 2ge and the theta angle

 = 4e with e evaluated at the horizon as

e = (pq + n20)/(n2 + q2).

(4.5)

thus in the same spirit of maldacena, we should have an ads5/cf t4 correspondence here

but with the string coupling ge and the axion e.

this equivalent simple d3 brane is taken as the eective vacuum conguration for this

correspondence. in analogy with the study of the decoupling limit of the (f, d3) bound

state in [1], we may anticipate that this eective vacuum corresponds to ((f, d1), d3) bound

state. in order to provide some evidence for this we notice that once the above coordinate

rescalings are done, the information about the (f, d1) bound states in the ((f, d1), d3)

disappears in the resulting metric. however, unlike the case for (f, d3) discussed in [1],

we have the extra factor (1 + q2/n2) appearing in the metric and therefore we should be

careful in identifying ge as the string coupling in the equivalent d3 brane. we discuss in

the following how to make this identication in an unambiguous manner.

note that in order to nd a stable bps conguration of d3 branes (in general p-branes)

from the corresponding supergravity, we usually insist either the einstein frame or the string

frame metric to be asymptotically minkowski. there actually exists a general choice for the

asymptotic metric which includes the above two choices. specically, we can re-obtain the

p-brane solutions in [12] by insisting the einstein metric gm n to go to ev0m n asymptotically

with v0 an arbitrary but given constant and m n the at minkowski metric. for example,

v0 = 0 corresponds to choosing the einstein metric to be asymptotically minkowski while

v0 = 0/2 corresponds to choosing the string metric to be asymptotically minkowski with
0 the asymptotic value of the dilaton. let us specialize for the d3 brane in type iib theory.

with this choice of asymptotic einstein metric, we can repeat the calculation in [13] to have

the following einstein metric

ds2

e = ev0[h 1/2((dx0)2 +    + (dx3)2) + h 1/2dyidyi]

(4.6)

13

where the harmonic function h is now

h = 1 +

42n

r4

e2v0,

(4.7)

and the integer n is the 5-form ux. if we denote the constant dilaton for this solution as

c0, then the string frame metric is

ds2 = ec0/2+v0[h 1/2((dx0)2 +    + (dx3)2) + h 1/2dyidyi],

(4.8)

as usual, in obtaining this metric we have set the brane -model coordinates  = x for

 = 0, 1, 2, 3.

now let us examine the near-horizon behavior of the above metric in the decoupling

limit. we have (u = r

ds2 = " u 2

(4.9)

in front of du 2/u 2 or d2

where gs = ec0 is the present string coupling. we note from (4.9) that: 1) the coecient
5 is always given by 4ngs, independent of the constant v0.
this provides us a way to read o the string coupling unambiguously from a near-horizon

geometry of d3 brane. 2) also, unless v0 = c0/2 (i.e., the string metric is asymptotically
minkowski), the near-horizon metric of a d3 brane is in general not in the standard form of
ads5  s5. now by comparing eq. (4.4) with (4.9), we can see that the ge is indeed the
string coupling for the equivalent simple d3 brane and the asymptotic string metric for the

equivalent d3 brane is not minkowski but

ev0m n = g1/2

e

(1 + q2/n2)1/2m n .

(4.10)

we also note from eqs.(4.4) and (4.9) that the dierences between the equivalent d3
branes and the usual d3 branes (with string coupling g = e0 and v0 = 0/2) are in the
string coupling constant and the asymptotic form of the metric. so the eects of these (f,

d1) bound states must be encoded in the eective string coupling ge given in eq. (4.2) and

the factor 1 + q2/n2. first let us examine the tension for the equivalent d3 brane. since we

14

have already determined its string coupling as ge, so the tension for this equivalent simple

d3 brane is nt 3

0 /ge. now if we use the explicit expression for the ge, we nd

nt 3

.

(4.11)

comparing it with eq. (3.3), we nd that they dier by a factor (1 + q2/n2)1. recall

that in obtaining (3.3), we calculated the tension against asymptotic d3 worldvolume whose

metric is asymptotically minkowski. in other words, the worldvolme is calculated according

to a4 = r d4. however, the tension in eq. (4.11) for the equivalent d3 brane is calculated

with respect to its own asymptotic string metric which is in general not the same as the

string metric for the original ((f, d1), d3) conguration. in the present case, the asymptotic

string metric for the equivalent d3 brane is g1/2

e ev0m n with ev0 given by eq. (4.10). for

m, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, it gives the worldvolume asymptotic metric. therefore, the tension in eq.

(4.11) is calculated against the worldvolume a

4 = gee2v0 r d4. in order to make a proper

comparison with the tension (3.3), the present tension should be measured with respect to

the same worldvolume, i.e., a4 rather than a

4. in other words, we expect that

nt 3
0
ge

a

a4

(4.12)

should be the same as the tension of ((f, d1), d3) given by eq. (3.3). this is indeed true

since a

4/a4 = (1+q2/n2). this indicates that the vacuum conguration for the ads5/cf t4

correspondence in this case is the ((f, d1), d3) bound state.

on the sym side, the ads5/cf t4 correspondence suggested above implies that the

electric and magnetic ux lines should disappear, too. as claimed, the gauge coupling and

the theta angle should now be given as g2

ym = 2ge and  = 4e, respectively. showing

these two relations from the sym side independently is certainly a non-trivial check of this

correspondence. we will show below that these two relations are indeed true from the sym

side.

we know from d-brane picture that the dynamics of a single d3 brane (or n coincident

d3 branes) is described in general, in the low energy limit, by the abelian (or non-abelian

15

u(n)) born-infeld action of n = 4 sym coupled with background elds. in the decoupling
limit, these background elds are decoupled and therefore the d3 brane (or n coincident d3

branes) is described purely by the gauge elds with at minkowski background. since the

non-abelian version of the born-infeld action for n coincident d3 branes is not known yet3,

we limit ourselves here to the abelian born-infeld action of a single d3 brane. this turns

out to be sucient for conrming the abovementioned relations.

our worldvolume study in [3] and the spacetime study in [1] show that the f-strings and

d-strings in ((f, d1), d3) correspond to the quantized constant electric eld (2)e =

g(p q0) and the quantized constant magnatic eld (2)b = q, respectively, in the linear
approximation4. for a single d3 brane (i.e., n = 1), while the linear approximation can be

justied for the electric eld e by insisting a small string coupling g, this approximation is

not valid, strictly speaking, for the magnetic eld b with a non-vanishing integer q. even so,

we obtain the correct tension for the bound state ((f, d1), d3). the success in obtaining

the tension for ((f, d1), d3) even for n 6= 1 seems to indicate that we may take the n
coincident d3 branes eectively as a single d3 brane with a tension nt 3
0 and the constant
electric eld as (2)e = g(pq0)/n and the constant magnetic eld as (2)b = q/n at
least for these two constant background elds. if we assume this, the linear approximation

can always be made by insisting, for example, n >> q, n >> p, with small g. we will take

these eective e and b as our constant background elds where n = 1 is just a special case.

let us recall that in [3], we picked a special direction, i.e, the x1-direction, as the direction

for the quantized constant electric and magnetic elds. by doing so, we break the lorentz

so(1, 3) to so(1, 1)  so(2). in order to nd the corresponding description of the bulk
equivalent simple d3 brane, we now need to make a consistent ansatz for the background

3a possible form was suggested by tseylin [14].

4even though these electric and magnetic elds are good only in the linear approximation, the

tension obtained in [3] is actually exact. this is the property of a bps state.

16

gauge elds which respects the so(1, 3) symmetry as well as the translational symmetry.

this can be achieved in the following two ways. we can take a stochastic averaging of a

constant homogeneous background as in [7]. or we can follow [15] to take the constant

homogeneous background as the ground-state expectation value. we here follow the latter

approach and have

(4.13)

where <    > denotes the vacuum expectation value of eld operators, 
 is the totally antisymetric tensor with 0123 = 1 (, , ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3). in the above, we
rst have < f 2 >= 2a and < f f >= 4b with a and b the corresponding constant vevs5.
then we determine the right side of the above second equation by insisting a = (b2e2) and
b = eb with e and b the background elds given before. also, here f = (1/2)
f.
since our purpose is to nd the eective gauge coupling and the eective theta angle for

 
 

 and

 = 



the uctuations of gauge elds with respect to the above background, so we need to consider

only the gauge elds in the bi action with the lagrangian

(4.14)

where g = e0 and 0 are the asymptotic string coupling and the asymptotic value of the

now we write f = f + f with f, the uctuating eld and f, the background,
i.e., < f >= 0 and < ff  >= 0 and expand the above lagrangian, with respect to the

background, to quadratic order in f. we end up with a quadratic lagrangian of f as

it should be pointed out that in obtaining the second expression of eq.(4.16), we have used

(4.19)

which, in the linear approximation, agree completely with the predictions of the ads5  s5
correspondence, i.e., g2
ym = 2ge and  = 4e, respectively. we can examine this simply

by expanding ge given by eq. (4.2) and e given by eq. (4.5) to quadratic order in charge

p and q as:

(4.21)

so we conrm the predictions of the ads5  s5 correspondence between the sym coupling
and the eective string coupling and between the theta angle and the value of the rr scalar

evaluated at the horizon. in analogy with the bulk picture of the f-strings and d-strings in

the decoupling limit, the eects of the electric and magnetic background elds are absorbed

into the gauge coupling constant g2

ym = 2ge and the theta angle  = 4e and they

do not appear in the resulting sym theory. therefore, we expect that the superconformal

symmetry is then restored. thus we have a consistent picture both in the bulk and on the

brane.

given the ads5/cf t4 correspondence with respect to the equivalent simple d3 brane, we

should have an ads5/cf t4 correspondence with respect to the ((f, d1), d3) conguration

with the string coupling ge and the gauge coupling g2

ym = 2ge. this in turn indicates

that maldacenas ads5/cf t4 correspondence holds true even for this non-trivial d3 brane

conguration but now with the string coupling ge rather than the usual string coupling g.

as in the case of (f, d3) bound state, the eective string coupling in eq.(3.6) is again

quantized but now in terms of integers p, q, n. from eq. (4.2) we nd that the f-strings in

((f, d1), d3) tend to decrease the coupling while the d-strings tend to increase it. therefore,

we may control the string coupling in the near-horizon region by adding or subtracting f-

strings (or d-strings).

v. t-dual daughters of ((f, d1), d3)

once we have the space-time conguration for the non-threshold ((f, d1), d3) bound

state as given in section 2, its descendants can be obtained from this by t-dualities, as

described in detail in [1]. t-dualities can be applied either along the transverse directions

of the d3 brane in ((f, d1), d3) or along the longitudinal directions of the d3 brane

19

which includes the direction of the (f, d1)-strings. even though these congurations can,

in principle, be obtained directly from the equations of motion of type iia or type iib

supergravity theory, it would be very dicult to obtain them in practice if we do not have

these symmetries in hand. there is no doubt that these congurations will play an important

role in the formulation of the unique m- or u-theory.

in this section, we will rst discuss all possible non-threshold bound states which can be

obtained from ((f, d1), d3) by t-dualities6, following the table given below:

parallel transverse

dp d(p  1) d(p + 1)
f

w

f

w

f

ns5 ns5

kk

kk

w

kk

ns5

in this table w, f, ns5 and kk denote waves, fundamental strings, ns vebranes, and

kk monopoles, respectively, and they are associated with nsns elds. dp (1  p  8)
are the so-called d-branes and are associated with the rr elds.

then we will present explicit einstein-frame metric and dilaton for each of the non-

threshold ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) bound states for 2  p  5 where the well-known (dp, d(p
+ 2)) bound states are just special cases.

let us begin with the t-dualities along the transverse directions of the d3 brane. we

denote the coordinates along the d3 brane as x0, x1, x2, x3, and 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as its transverse

directions. we also denote (ti :7) as the t-duality along the i-th direction. according to
the above table, we have

((f, d1), d3) (t4 :7) ((f, d2), d4) (t5 :7) ((f, d3), d5) (t6 :7) ((f, d4), d6)
(t7 :7) ((f, d5), d7) (t8 :7) ((f, d6), d8).

(5.1)

6we do not consider any dp brane resulting from d9 brane.

20

we can t-dualize each of the above ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) for 1  p  6 along the
longitudinal directions of the original d3 brane, i.e., 1, 2 , 3 directions. we end up with

dierent bound states depending on whether we t-dualize along the 1 direction rst or

not. we demonstrate this on ((f, d1), d3) as examples. the other cases just follow. if we

t-dualize ((f, d1), d3) along the 1, i.e., the direction of (f, d1)-strings, we end up with

((w, d0), d2). if we t-dualize along the 3, we have ((f, d2), d2). we can now t-dualize

on ((f, d2), d2) along either 2 or 1. in the former case, we have ((f, d3), d1) while for

the latter we have ((w, d1), d1). we can further t-dualize ((f, d3), d1) along the 1, we

end up with ((w, d2), d0).

in general, we have ((w, d(p  1)), d(p + 1)) if we t-dualize along 1 direction rst
on the ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) for 1  p  6. if we t-dualize rst along 3 instead, we have
((f, d(p + 1)), d(p + 1)). if we t-dualize on ((f, d(p + 1)), d(p + 1)) along either 1

or 2, we end up with ((w, dp), dp) or ((f, d(p + 2)), dp), respectively. further we can

t-dualize on ((f, d(p + 2)), dp) along 1, we end up with ((w, d(p + 1)), d(p  1)). we
summarize all the bound states obtained this way in the following table where the second

column indicates the common directions shared by the two d branes in the corresponding

bound state:

((w, d(p  1)), d(p + 1))

these are all possible non-threshold bound states which can be obtained from ((f, d1),

d3) by t-dualities. among these bound states, the well-known (dp, d(p +2)) bound states

for 0  p  6 [16] appear as special cases when the charges associated with either f-strings

21

or w-waves are set to zero. if we set the charge associated with the w-waves in ((w, dp),

dp) or the f-strings in ((f, d(p + 1)), d(p + 1)) for 1  p  6 to zero, we end up with
non-threshold (dp, dp) bound states 1  p  7 which appear to be new. as mentioned
above, the two dps share only (p 1) common directions. for those in the type iib theory,
we can apply sl(2,z) to obtain new bound states. for examples, from ((f, d3), d3), we can

have (((f, d1), d3), d3). one can also perform the consistency checks of the ads5/cf t4

correspondence for these two bound states.

if we t-dualize (((f, d1), d3), d3) along the common direction of the two d3s only,

we have (((f, d2), d2), d2).

if we now set the charge associated with the f-strings to

zero, we end up with a non-threshold bound state (d2, d2, d2). the three d2s share

only one common direction. we can obtain (d1, d1, d1) by t-dualizing along the common

direction of the three d2s or we can obtain(dp, dp, dp) for 3  p  7 by t-dualizing along
directions transverse to (d2, d2, d2). the three dps in (dp, dp, dp) for 1  p  7 share
p  1 common directions. we can also obtain (((f, d3), d3), d3) by t-dualizing along one
of directions transverse to (((f,d2), d2), d2). then we apply sl(2,z) to (((f, d3), d3),

d3), we can obtain ((((f, d1), d3), d3), d3). if we t-dualize this state along the common

direction of the three d3s only, we obtain ((((f, d2), d2),d2),d2). by setting the charge

associated the f-strings to zero, we end up with the non-threshold bound state (d2, d2, d2,

d2). we repeat what we have done for (d2, d2, d2). we can have non-threshold bound

states (dp, dp, dp, dp) for 1  p  6 where the four dps share p  1 common directions.
we can continue this process to have bound states (dp, dp, dp, dp, dp) for 1  p  5 and
so on. finally, in this way we can have a seemingly unique bound state (d1, d1, d1, d1,

d1, d1, d1, d1, d1) where the nine d1s share no common direction.

also, from ((f, d5), d5), we can have (((f, d1), (ns5, d5)), (ns5, d5)) by s-duality

of type iib theory. as we will demonstrate in a bit simpler case of this, i.e., ((f, d1), (ns5,

d5)), in [17] that the charges for the d5- and ns5-branes are related to the charges for

the f-strings and d-strings. this may suggest that the formation of the sl(2,z) vebrane

bound states [8,18,19] be closely related to that of (f, d1) bound states or (m, n)-strings.

22

from ((f, d3), d5), we can have (((f, d1), d3), (ns5, d5)) and so on.

once we have these new bound states, we can again apply t-dualities to obtain other

new bound states, then s-dualities on those in type iib. we can continue this process to

obtain all possible non-threshold bound states by s- and t-dualities simply from the original

(f, d1)-strings. all these non-threshold bound states preserve one half of the spacetime

supersymmetries. even though we are, at this point, unable to count how many of these

bound states are there, we believe that the total number of these bound states is nite and

may be related to the number of generators of the largest nite u-duality group [11] in type

ii theory, i.e., e8(+8). after all, these bound states are obtained by repeated applications of

the s- and t-dualities. we speculate here that these bound states will form the multiplets

of the e8(+8) u-duality symmetry in the yet unknown m- or u-theory. we wish to come

back to provide more evidence for this elsewhere.

in closing this section we provide, as examples, the explicit einstein-frame metric and

the dilaton for each of the ((f, d(p  2)), dp) bound states for 3  p  7. the metric is

ds2 = e0/2(hh )1/4h (p3)/8hh 1(cid:16)(dx0)2 + (dx1)2(cid:17) + h 1(cid:16)(dx2)2 + (dx3)2(cid:17)

+h 1(cid:16)(dx4)2 +    + (dxp)2(cid:17) + dyidyii ,

with i = 1,   , 9  p; and the dilaton is

e = e0(h h)1/2h (7p)/4.

(5.2)

(5.3)

in the above, we have chosen the string-frame metric to be asymptotically minkowski. the

harmonic function h is

h = 


1 + qp

r7p ,

1  q7 ln r,

3  p  6,
p = 7,

(5.4)

with qp = 1/2

(p,q,n)e30/220/[(7  p)8p] and the harmonic functions h  and h  are

h  = h(n2h + q2) e0 + (p  0q)2 e0i 1

q2 h e0 + (p  0q)2 h  e0

h  =

(p,q,n),

q2 e0 + (p  0q)2 e0

.

(5.5)

23

other elds can be obtained from those given in section 3 for the ((f, d1), d3) conguration,

following the prescription given in [1]. in the above, the -factor continues to be given by

eq. (3.1) but now the integer p represents the quantized charge per (2)p1(p1)/2 area over
the x2    xp-plane carried by the f-strings, the integer q represents the quantized charge per
(2)2 area over the xp1xp-plane carried by the d(p  2) branes, and the integer n is the
quantized (p + 2)-form charge carried by the dp brane. the tension for each of these bound

states can be calculated by generalizing the mass per unit p-brane volume given in [20] in a

similar fashion as we did in [1]. the result is

tp(p, q, n) =

t p
0

g qn2 + q2 + g2(p  0q)2,

(5.6)

where the subscript p in tp and the superscript p in t p

0 should not be confused with the

integral charge p for the f-strings.

vi. conclusion

to conclude, we have constructed in this paper the explicit space-time conguration for

the non-threshold ((f, d1), d3) bound state using the type iib sl(2,z) symmetry and

the known (f, d3) conguration. we have shown that the ((f, d1), d3) bound state is

identical to the bound state consisting of d3 branes carrying quantized constant electric and

magnetic elds. the (p, q)-strings are identical to the corresponding electric and magnetic,

or dyonic, ux lines. this also connects the type iib sl(2,z) symmetry in the bulk with the

sl(2,z) symmetry in the sym theory on the brane. we have studied the decoupling limit

of this bound state. we found that given the ads5/cf t4 correspondence of maldacena

with respect to a simple d3 brane and the usual string coupling, we should have a similar

correspondence with respect to this bound state but now with an eective string coupling.

this, in turn, indicates that maldacenas ads5/cf t4 correspondence holds true even for

a non-trivial d3 brane conguration with the corresponding eective string coupling rather

than the usual string coupling. we also found that d-strings in ((f, d1), d3) bound state

24

tend to increase the eective string coupling while the f-strings tend to decrease it. this

property may be used to control the string coupling in the bulk and the sym coupling on

the brane in the near-horizon region.

we have given the list of all possible descendants of this ((f, d1), d3) bound states by

t-dualities. unless there is an obstacle preventing us to perform t-dualities and the type iib

sl(2,z) on these bound states, we have predicted the existence of new non-threshold bound

states (dp, dp) for 1  p  8 where the two dps share only (p  1) common dimensions,
(dp, dp, dp) for 1  p  7 with the three dps sharing p  1 common directions, (dp, dp.
dp, dp) for 1  p  6 with the four dps sharing p  1 common directions and so on. this
process stops at the seemingly unique bound state (d1, d1, d1, d1, d1, d1, d1, d1, d1)

with the nine d1s sharing no common direction. moreover, we have presented the explicit

congurations for the ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) bound states for 2  p  5. using the type
iib sl(2,z) symmetries on those newly obtained bound states, we can construct further

complicated bound states. then by t-dualities, we can have even more bound states. we

can probably exhaust all possible bound states by continuing this process. all these bound

states are bps ones, preserving one half of the spacetime supersymmetries. these bound

states can, in principle, be obtained from the equations of motion without the need to use

the s- and t-dualities. they are expected to appear in the uncompactied m- or u-theory.

we have conjectured that the total number of these bound states are nite and these bound

states will form multiplets of the u-duality group e8(+8) in the yet unknown m- or u-theory.
