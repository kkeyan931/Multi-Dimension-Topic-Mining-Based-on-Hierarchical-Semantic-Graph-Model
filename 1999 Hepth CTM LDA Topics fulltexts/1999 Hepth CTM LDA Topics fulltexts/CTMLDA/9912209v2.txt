abstract

we investigate black hole formation by a spherically collapsing thin shell of
matter in ads space. this process has been suggested to have a holographic in-
terpretation as thermalization of the cft on the boundary of the ads space. the
ads/cft duality relates the shell in the bulk to an o-equilibrium state of the
boundary theory which evolves towards a thermal equilibrium when the shell col-
lapses to a black hole. we use 2-point functions to obtain information about the
spectrum of excitations in the o-equilibrium state, and discuss how it character-
izes the approach towards thermal equilibrium. the full holographic interpretation
of the gravitational collapse would require a kinetic theory of the cft at strong
coupling. we speculate that the kinetic equations should be interpreted as a holo-
graphic dual of the equation of motion of the collapsing shell.

1 introduction

following the discovery of the ads/cft correspondence [1] a large amount of work has
been devoted to clarifying and extending its implications. this work has been recently
reviewed in [2] where an extensive list of references can be found. in this context, we have
investigated [3, 4, 5] the relation between physics in the bulk of ads and its holographic
dual. we have mainly focused on the formulation in minkowski signature [6, 7] since
this allows the study of dynamical processes. in particular we have been interested in the
holographic interpretation of black hole formation in the bulk since the full understanding
of this process is an important step towards the ultimate goal of nding a holographic
interpretation of the black hole information problem [8], and (hopefully) its solution. we
also believe that by investigating the formation of black holes one will gain a deeper
understanding of general features of holography. the process that we are focusing on is
the spherical collapse of a thin shell of unspecied matter in the bulk. a special case, the
spherical collapse of a dust shell in ads3, was analyzed by peleg and steif in [9]4. in the
holographic dual, a at space eld theory with no gravity, the bulk process is expected to
correspond to the time evolution and thermalization of an initial out of equilibrium state
[7, 11, 12, 13]. the collapse of the shell due to gravity describes the approach towards
equilibrium, while the nal formation of the black hole corresponds to thermalization. it
is intriguing how a gravitational process in the bulk is encoded in a kinetic process in
the holographic dual. this, we believe, suggests a deep connection through holography
between gravity and kinetic theory of the boundary theory.

in [4] we developed green function techniques that allowed us to obtain the holographic
images of various objects in the bulk. in [5] we used these techniques to begin our study
of black hole formation. as a rst step we studied the case of a very large shell of matter
which is just beginning to collapse. in this case we could neglect the motion of the shell
and use a quasistatic approximation. the motivation for the study was to nd out how
the scale-radius duality [7, 12, 15, 16] encodes the radial size of a spherically symmetric
shell, and to nd properties of the o-equlibrium state in the holographic dual. we found
that the presence of the shell manifested itself in the form of a series of poles in the
propagator. the location of these poles depends on the radius of the shell, in agreement
with the scale-radius duality. a slight surprise was that the poles also had an imaginary
part. hence they can be interpreted as unstable collective excitations, shellons (since
they exist because of the shell), in the o-equlibrium state.

in this paper we will carry the analysis one step further. while we are not yet able to
address the time-dependence of the collapse, there is another regime where a quasistatic

in [10].

approach can again be adopted: the very last stage when the shell is approaching the
horizon radius rh of the black hole about to form. there are two ways to justify the
quasistatic approximation.

first, in the nal stage of the gravitational collapse the shell appears to freeze in
the frame of an asymptotic observer. the approach of the radius of the shell rs to the
radius of the horizon rh is exponentially slow,

rs  rh

rh  et/h ,

where the characteristic timescale h is inversely proportional to the hawking tempera-
ture5,

h =

therefore, the quasistatic approximation is applicable for evaluating the propagator as
long as we focus on energies which are larger than the inverse characteristic timescale,

(3)

at the same time, this is the region of interest for investigating the approach to ther-
mal equilibrium. at equilibrium, the propagator becomes thermal, with a characteristic
innite sequence of thermal poles

n = i4nth + const.

, n = 1,2, . . . .

(4)

when the radius of the shell is slightly larger than the horizon radius, the boundary theory
is slightly out of equilibrium, and one nds a correction factor to the thermal propagator
which has additional (shellon) poles and zeroes. they characterize the deviation from
the equilibrium; the poles and zeroes ow together and disappear during the approach to
equilibrium.

second, one can avoid the restriction to large frequencies by investigating a slightly
dierent way of approaching the equilibrium. in the bulk one can consider a sequence
of static spherical shells with a constant total adm mass, but with progressively smaller
radii approaching the horizon radius. instead of starting with a shell at rest and letting
it collapse freely, this corresponds to slowing down the collapse by applying an external
force so that the process becomes quasistatic, while increasing the amount of matter in
the shell. the adm energy needs to be kept xed to ensure that the shell approaches its
horizon radius, therefore the loss of kinetic energy needs to be compensated by adding
matter to the shell during the process. in this case one obtains more detailed information

5this is true for the production of a generic black hole in a generic dimension.

about the propagator in the boundary theory. presumably, the quasistatic approximation
amounts in the boundary theory to replace the kinetic theory by a thermodynamical
treatment of small deviations from equilibrium. in thermodynamics the evolution of a
system is always considered to be quasistatic, and small deviations from equilibrium can
be arranged to be such by applying external forces. the evolution is then determined by
the gradient of entropy depending on a small parameter characterizing the deviation from
equilibrium, which should correspond to the applied force balancing the gravitational force
in the bulk. in contrast, recently [14] the equations of motion in the bulk were related to
renormalization group equations in the boundary. this is a good interpretation for the
static background geometry but general relativity also determines the time evolution of an
object in the bulk  this is a dynamical process related to the dynamics of the boundary
as discussed above.

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we review our previous work and
compare our results with other recent work on black hole formation [17, 18, 19, 20]. the
analysis of the last stages of black hole formation in the case of ads3 is given in section
3. section 4 contains a discussion of results and some ideas for the future.

2 derivation of the correlators

we begin by briey reviewing (following [21, 22] and as described in [5]) the essential
steps of the computation of a two point function of a boundary operator coupling to a
bulk scalar eld in an asymptotically ads spacetime. a scalar eld in the bulk satises
the classical equation of motion

" 1
g

gg  m2# (t, ~x, r) = 0

(5)

where g is the bulk metric and the mass term m2 contains the mass of the eld, the
coupling to the curvature scalar6, and contributions from a kaluza-klein reduction on a
compact internal space, if the original spacetime is higher dimensional. at rst, we choose
the desired coordinate system for (a part of) ads space. we will work in minkowski signa-
ture. depending on the choice of coordinates, we then impose the appropriate boundary
condition for the bulk eld in the interior. for example, in ads with global coordinates
one requires that  vanishes at the origin. in poincare coordinates or in the case of a
black hole, the appropiate boundary condition at the horizon is an ingoing wave when
the imaginary part of the energy is positive and an outgoing when it is negative. the

6when we consider e.g. a spacetime of a collapsing shell in adsd+1 with d > 2, the exterior metric
has a nonconstant scalar curvature. in such cases we assume that the scalar eld is minimally coupled
so that m2 remains a constant.

propagator then has a cut on the real axis where the imaginary part changes sign. let
t, ~x denote the coordinates that parametrize the boundary, and let r denote the radial
coordinate. we perform a fourier transformation to momentum space in the boundary
coordinates, so the interior solution is (, ~k, r). this solution is uniquely determined (up
to an overall normalization) by the boundary conditions discussed above.

we then study its behavior near the boundary. in minkowski signature, there are two
kinds of bulk eld modes, normalizable and non-normalizable7. in momentum space, we
denote the former by (+)(, ~k, r) and the latter by ()(, ~k, r). we normalize the modes
such that their asymptotic behavior near the boundary is

where

()(, ~k, r) = r  1 (r  )

 =

(d 

d2 + 4m2) 

d
2   .

(6)

(7)

now, in the asymptotic region, the interior solution (, ~k, r) becomes a linear combina-
tion of the normalizable and non-normalizable solutions, with an asymptotic behavior

(t, ~x, r)  r+c(, ~k) + rd(, ~k) .

(8)

the coecient d(, ~k) is the fourier transform of the boundary data 0(t, ~x) which acts
as a source term for a dimension + operator o(t, ~x) in the boundary theory [21, 22].
next, we rewrite (8) in the form

where

(, ~k, r)  hr+g(, ~k) + ri 0(, ~k) ,

g(, ~k) =

c(, ~k)
d(, ~k)

.

(9)

(10)

one can then check that the (nite part) of the two point function of the operator o at
the boundary has the momentum space form8

ho(, ~k)o(, ~k)i = (cid:18)+  

2

(cid:19) ( + )(~k + ~k)g(, ~k) .

(11)

in the case that the geometry has a horizon, the propagator, as a function of the
frequency , has a cut on the real axis which arises from the boundary conditions as we
in that case one can analytically continue the propagator from the
already discussed.

7the minkowski signature version of ads/cft duality was rst investigated in [6, 7].
8the evaluation of the overall coecient involves a subtlety, see [23]. in the remainder of the paper

we will suppress overall coecients as they do not aect the pole structure of the propagator.

upper half-plane into the lower half-plane. this analytic continuation can have poles on
the lower half plane signaling the presence of unstable quasi particles.

next, we compute the propagator in the presence of a thin matter shell of radius rs
in adsd+1 space. we are going to restrict attention to a quasistatic approximation: we
assume that the shell is collapsing very slowly (as measured in the asymptotic time),
so that it appears to be static9. the static case has an interest also of its own since it
provides a series of states which are closer and closer to equilibrium. understanding how
these states dier from the black hole from the boundary point of view, gives an insight
into the boundary processes at work. furthermore, the usual thermodynamical approach
to out of equilibrium states is to consider states which are at equilibrium but for a variable
that is externally kept xed. in this case the variable is the radius of the shell.

in the interior of the shell, the metric is the ads metric in global coordinates, and the
exterior metric is the ads black hole metric. both metrics can be expressed in the form

ds2 = f (r)dt2 +

dr2
f (r)

+ r2dd1 ,

with the function f (r):

f (r) = ( f1(r) = 1 + r2
f2(r) = 1  

rd2 + r2

if
if

r < rs
r > rs ,

(12)

(13)

where the parameter  is related to the adm mass of the black hole. the radius of the
horizon of the black hole, rh, is determined by solving the equation f2(rh) = 0. (we
are using units where t, r and the angular coordinates are dimensionless and the ads
radius is set to r = 1. the dimensions can be restored by replacing everywhere r  r/r
etc. with the metric (12), the scalar eld equation (5) can be reduced (after a fourier
transformation to momentum space in the boundary coordinates) to the radial equation

(14)

where k2 = l(l + d  2), l = 0, 1, 2, . . . is the eigenvalue of the laplacian on the (d  1)-
sphere. the interior and exterior solutions 1 and 2 of the radial equation must be
matched across the thin shell using ux conservation. the matching conditions are

1|r=rs = 2|r=rs

f1(r)r1|r=rs = f2(r)r2|r=rs .

(15)

(16)

9of course, a complete treatment should take into account what happens when the shell is collapsing
rapidly. this can be expected to give rise to particle production in the boundary theory even if we neglect
the particle production in the bulk. we will leave these more demanding issues aside here.

5

to nd the propagator g(, ~k) in the boundary, we rst expand the exterior solution in
normalizable and non-normalizable modes,

2(, ~k, r)  r+c(, ~x) + rd(, ~k) ,

(17)

then substitute (17) in the matching conditions above, solve for the ratio c/d in terms
of 1 and 2, and substitute into equation (10) which gives the propagator. the result is

g(, ~k) = 

1f2r()
1f2r(+)

2  ()
2  (+)

2 f1r1
2 f1r1

.

(18)

in the above, all quantities are evaluated at the radius of the shell rs. the analytic
structure of the resulting propagator gives information about the spectrum of excitations
in the boundary theory. in particular, we are interested in the poles of the propagator at
zero transverse momentum (~k = 0) in the complex -plane. poles at positive real -axis
correspond to masses of stable composite objects created and annihilated by o. however,
we will typically nd complex poles at

n = mn 

i
2

n

(19)

corresponding to unstable resonances created and annihilated by o. in a previous paper[5],
we used the name shellons for the resonances. the real part mn gives the mass of the
resonance, and the imaginary part n is the width which is the inverse of the lifetime.
there can also be poles in the imaginary -axis, for example when the black hole has
fully formed and the boundary theory has thermalized. then the boundary propaga-
tor becomes a thermal propagator, and the imaginary poles are related to periodicity in
imaginary time.

from (18), we see that the poles typically correspond to the zeroes of the denominator
(unless they cancel against those of the numerator). the vanishing of the denominator
means that the interior solution 1 matches completely with a normalizable exterior so-
lution (+)
. thus, the total mode is normalizable  unless  is complex, in which case it
will be quasinormalizable. for a better understanding of the situation, it is instructive to
map the radial equation into the form of a schrodinger equation and consider the resulting
quantum mechanical analogue. we rescale the eld  as

2

(, ~k, r) = r(d+1)/2(, ~k, r)

and use a tortoise coordinate

r = z

dr
f (r)

.

6

(20)

(21)

note that we have to use f1 in the interior and f2 in the exterior, so we must add an
integration constant to ensure that r is continuous across the shell. the range of r is
nite. for example, if d = 2, we get

r = (  1

ln(cid:16) r+rh
rrh(cid:17)
arctan(r)  r0

2rh

where

r0 = arctan(rs) +

1
2rh

r > rs
0  r < rs
ln(cid:18)rs + rh
rs  rh(cid:19)

and the full range of r is the nite interval r0  r  0. in the following we will mostly
be considering the case where the radius of the nal black hole, rh, and therefore also the
radius of the shell, rs, are very large compared to the ads radius (rs > rh  1 in our
units). the radial equation in the interior will then reduce to that in a poincare patch of
ads space (see [5]), and the two equations above become

the full range of r is now the innite interval   r  0, corresponding to the innite
ads throat.

with the above rescalings, the radial equation (14) reduces to the form of a time

independent schrodinger equation,

r + v (r) = 2

(27)

where r = r(r) from inverting (21) and f = f (r(r)). thus the problem of solving the
radial equation becomes analogous to a one dimensional quantum mechanical scattering
problem. in figure 1 a typical prole of the potential is depicted. it blows up at the
boundary and has a small barrier at the location of the shell10. there is also an innite
well at r = r0, but when we consider a large black hole the well is pushed down the

shell, we would need to consider quantum mechanical scattering with a time dependent potential: the
barrier would be moving to the left.

ads throat towards r =  and plays no role in the calculation. now let us return to
the poles of (18). as we discussed above, the appropriate interior boundary condition for
1 is that it is a purely ingoing wave. on the other hand, the normalizable mode in the
exterior is a superposition of an outgoing wave and an ingoing wave, due to the reection
from the boundary of ads. for example, it is simple to check this by looking at the high
frequency limit of the normalizable mode (+)

[3, 5], which looks like

(28)

where 0 is a constant phase shift. for the wavefunction  this means that it is a
superposition of ingoing and outgoing waves with equal amplitude on the right hand side
of the barrier corresponding to the shell (see figure 1) and on the left hand side there
is a purely ingoing wave. thus there is total reection together with transmission  it is
impossible to satisfy both conditions with real energy levels. however, it is possible with
complex energy levels 2. this is another way to see why the poles appear at complex
frequencies . incidentally, note that using the tortoise coordinate (21), the propagator
(18) takes an even simpler form - it is just a ratio of two wronskians

evaluated at r = r(rs).

let us compare our approach with other recent work. horowitz and hubeny [19]
investigated the quasinormal modes in the background of a black hole11. they study the
equation (14) with the black hole metric (f (r) = f2(r)). the boundary conditions in
[19] for a scalar eld are very similar to ours: one takes the eld to be a superposition
of outgoing and ingoing modes near the boundary (normalizable modes), whereas the
interior boundary condition in [19] is that there should be only ingoing modes near the
horizon of the black hole. in our case with a shell, the interior metric is that of a pure
ads space. however, if the radius of the shell is larger than the ads space (rs  1 in the
present units), a poincare horizon appears at r  0 (r = ) due to the approximation,
and there is a natural choice between ingoing or outgoing modes, which is reected in a
cut appearing in the propagator12 of the boundary operator o. thus, on a formal level
the modes we discussed in [5] are analogous to the quasinormal modes of black holes [19].
the complex spectrum arises because of the choice of boundary conditions, and the main
dierence between [19] and [5] is that the horizon of a black hole has been replaced by a
poincare horizon. however, the physical interpretation appears to be somewhat dierent.
the horizon of a black hole is a real boundary through which matter can fall in and be
lost, while the appearance of a poincare horizon in the above is merely an artifact of the
approximation since we started from global ads space. in reality we would expect an
ingoing wave to be reected back from the origin of the ads space and not to be lost.
what happens is that if the radius of the shell is much larger than the ads radius, rs  1,
and the frequency is complex (with  < 0) the reection is exponentially attenuated,
so that it can be suppressed. there are two other ways to arrange for the ingoing mode
from the shell not to come back at all. one way is simply to consider a shell falling into
an existing (small) black hole instead of creating the black hole in the collapse. another
way is to consider late times in the collapse when the shell is approaching the radius of
the horizon of the black hole about to be created. from the space-time diagram of black
hole formation in a spherical collapse, one can see that the horizon forms even before the
black hole has formed. therefore, the ingoing modes from the shell will be lost into the
region of trapped surfaces and never come back.

another related work is by giddings and ross [18] who investigated a collapsing shell
of d-branes. in their case, contrary to ours with an unspecied matter shell in ads space,
the geometry in the interior of the d-brane shell is at. hence they do not have an innite
throat, where objects falling in could get lost. instead, their space is cut o at a nite r.
as a consequence, when they investigate the poles of the propagator, they initially obtain
a discrete spectrum of stable excitations with real energies, much like the global modes in

11related work can be found in [24].
12the choice between the two sides of the cut corresponds to a choice between a retarded or advanced

propagator.

our case. however, the shell itself can absorb incoming waves, and after considering this
eect they also obtain imaginary contributions to the energy spectrum. so the absorption
by the shell plays a similar role as the absorption by the innite throat in ads space in
our case.

furthermore, balasubramanian and ross [17] have investigated black hole formation
in ads3 by point particles. the bulk solution was investigated by matschull [25], and
balasubramanian and ross investigate the use of 2-point functions in the boundary theory
to keep track of the positions of the point particles as they approach each other. in this
case one does not have the complication of spherical symmetry, the point particle positions
can be read o from kinks in the 2-point functions in coordinate space.

finally, we would like to mention a slightly dierent line of work on thermalization in
the context of black holes and ads/cft correspondence. kiritsis and taylor [26] investi-
gated d-brane probes falling into a black hole. in the process, the potential energy of the
probe is converted into heat, which then is absorbed by the black hole. by investigating
the bulk action of the probe, one can e.g. derive the equation of state for the black hole.
but, on the other hand, one can study the dual gauge theory eective action of the probe
at nite temperature and try to reproduce predictions from bulk calculations; this was
investigated in [27].

3 black hole formation in ads3

in this section we examine the boundary propagator in the case that a shell is quasistat-
ically forming a black hole in ads3 space. as in [5], we assume that the resulting black
hole has a much larger radius than that of the ads space: rh  1 in the present units.
the problem is to nd the modes 1, ()
2 which are needed in the propagator formula
(18). to nd the interior mode, note that in the region r > rs  1 we can approximate
f1(r) = 1 + r2  r2. then the radial equation becomes the mode equation in poincare co-
ordinates, and the mode solutions will be bessel functions   (1/r)j(2  k2/r). as

discussed in section 2, in poincare coordinates the natural choice for the interior boundary
condition is between ingoing and outgoing modes, and we choose the former, as we did
in [5]. however, in [5] we made an additional approximation and focused on the large
frequency limit /r  1. here we will not make that approximation, so the infalling
mode is the following linear combination

where  = 1 + m2 and c1 is a normalization constant (which will drop out in the answer

then, we need the exterior modes ()

in btz coordinates. in our previous paper [5],
we used a wkb approximation in the large frequency limit to obtain the modes. here,
we will instead use the exact solutions of the wave equation [28], the normalizable and
nonnormalizable modes can be found in [3]. if the shell is large (rs  r0), we use

into (18), we obtain the result for the propagator of the operator o on the boundary in
the presence of a large matter shell in the bulk. using the latter result we checked that
we reobtain our previous approximate result for the poles in the rs  rh,   rs limit:

this is sucient to illustrate the main point: the presence of the spherically symmetric
shell in the bulk is encoded in a tower of resonances in the boundary theory, with the
above spectrum from which one can read their masses and decay widths. an intriguing
thing about the shellon poles becomes apparent if we focus on the uv limit ||  1.
by the scale-radius duality one might have thought that we in the bulk are probing only
the geometry very near the boundary. but that is a region outside of the shell, so the
geometry is equal to the black hole geometry. on the other hand, near the boundary the
black hole metric reduces to the same form as the poincare metric. from these arguments
we might have expected that the analytic structure of the propagator in the uv limit is
either similar to that of the thermal propagator, or the poincare propagator13. on the
other hand, from (32) we know that there are poles for arbitrary large  arising from
the shell. a possible interpretation is that the poles of the propagator do not only carry
local information about the geometry of spacetime near the boundary - they also carry
information about an event that happens deep in the bulk inside the shell: the absorption
of the ingoing wave into the (ctitious) horizon, which was used as a boundary condition
in the evaluation of the propagator.

rather than present more details and more accurate results for the poles in the large
shell case, we turn our attention to the other extreme of the collapse of the shell: the
approach to the horizon radius ((r  rh)/rh  1) where we expect to see thermalization
on the boundary.

as the shell is approaching the horizon, we choose the following expressions for the

exterior normalizable and nonnormalizable modes [3]:

and we used  as dened in (31). we then plug the interior mode (30) and the exterior
modes (33) into the main propagator formula (18), and study its analytic structure.
to simplify matters, we again focus on the propagator at zero transverse momentum,
g(, k = 0).

let us begin with some general observations. as the shell approaches the horizon,
the boundary theory gets closer and closer to thermal equilibrium. therefore, in the
limit rs  rh, g(, k) should become the thermal propagator which we evaluated in our
previous work [5]. the thermal propagator (which we denote by gt (, k) from now on)
has a characteristic innite sequence of zeroes and poles, at zero momentum they are
located on the imaginary axis on the complex -plane. before the limit rs  rh, when
the shell is at a small distance from the horizon, the boundary theory is slighty o thermal
equilibrium. in that case, we nd it useful to write the propagator in a factorized form

g(, k = 0) = gt (, k = 0)  h(, k = 0) ,

(36)

this is useful for two reasons. first, if rs  rh and im > 0, then h(, k = 0)  1
and h encodes small deviations from the thermal equilibrium when rs 6= rh. second,
when im < 0, h(, k = 0) has poles which are then poles of the propagator. the
expression can be misleading if used on, for example, the imaginary axis, since gt has
poles at  = i4nth (th is the temperature of the black hole) whereas g does not
since they are canceled by h. these thermal poles appear in g only after taking the limit
rs  rh. formally one has to consider im > 0, take the limit rs  rh in which case
h(, k = 0)  1, and then analytically continue below the real axis. since then g = gt
they also have the same poles. the analytic continuation is necessary since when rs  rh
a new cut arises as an accumulation of poles and zeros. in fact it can be said that the cut
due to the boundary conditions at the poincare horizon is replaced by another one due
to the new boundary conditions at the horizon of the black hole which forms.

after discussing this point, we try to analyze the propagator without any approxima-
tions for the interior and exterior modes (30) and (33). we assume that we are initially
on the upper half -plane. then, one can see that the leading terms of the exterior modes

the correction factor h(, 0) is too complicated to allow us to nd an analytic expres-
sion for the poles. therefore we have evaluated them numerically, using maple v version
5. figure 2 below depicts the ow of the rst couple of poles of h as the shell radius
rs approaches the horizon radius rh. numerical investigations tell us that the poles of
h start out in the lower half complex -plane (where the poles were found as the shell
was still large), and then move towards the real axis and the origin. specically, as rs is
suciently close to r0, the real and imaginary parts of the poles  become much smaller
than rh, rs. further, the imaginary part decreases more rapidly than the real part, and
quickly becomes many orders of magnitude smaller. this is illustrated in table 1 below
which lists a few characteristic values for a pole as rs approaches rh.

we now turn to search for a simplied expression for h, and begin by making some
approximations for the interior and exterior modes. lets rst consider the exterior modes
()
h approaches 1 and we can do a series

expansion in (u  1) obtaining

(39)

similarly, we obtain a series expansion for the combination f2r()
in the equation (18) for the propagator,

2 which also appears

f2r()

2  2rnah(u  1) + o((u  1)+1)i  bh(u  1) + o((u  1)+1)io .
(40)
recalling that  = i/(2rh) it immediately follows that (u  1) is the leading term if
im > 0 whereas (u  1) dominates for im < 0. replacing in equation (18) results in

limrsrh g(, rs) =

(41)

note that independently of the function 1, i.e. independently of the boundary conditions
at the poincare throat, the propagator develops a cut with the right boundary conditions
at the horizon of the black hole. at the cut the imaginary part of the propagator changes
sign since a = b
.

after checking that in the limit rs  rh the propagator reduces to the black hole
propagator, we proceed to compute the corrections when rs is close but not equal to rh.
it is easy to see that if the dominant term is for example (u  1) then no corrections are
obtained from keeping terms of order (u  1)+n unless the term (u  1) is included.
the same occurs when im < 0 and (u  1) dominates. therefore, to compute the

g   a
as rs  rh, (u  1). this expression has no poles where it is valid, i.e. in the
upper half plane. similarly, in the lower half plane we have g   b
which again has
no poles where it is valid. let us now return to h. to nd the zeroes and poles of h ,
we have to solve for the values of  where the numerator or the denominator vanishes.

we aim here to conrm what we saw numerically before, namely that the poles and
zeros accumulate on the real axis giving rise to a cut. in that case what has to happen is
that the poles go to zero as rs  rh (see appendix for an example). to check this fact we
only need to study the propagator for frequencies such that /rs << 1 which is fortunate
since in that regime the equations simplify14 in two ways. first, the mode in the interior
of the shell, 1 can be expanded as:

if we consider the other process which was discussed in the introduction, the slowed down collapse at

is true for  = 1 + m2 > 0. note that the solutions are purely real. we commented
earlier that as rs  rh, the poles are complex, but ow towards the real axis and the
imaginary part quickly becomes many orders of magnitude smaller than the real part.
what happened above is that the imaginary part was too small to show up without
keeping more subleading terms. in fact keeping the term of order (/r) in (45) gives
rise to a tiny imaginary part, with a sign depending on the boundary conditions used.
in the extreme limit, the logarithm in the denominator of (52) begins to dominate more
and more over the -dependent term, so the poles and zeroes approach each other, nally
cancelling out and converting into a cut on the real axis. in the appendix we give a simple
example of how zeroes and poles can form a cut.

4 discussion

in the previous sections we have shown how, as the shell moves closer to its own horizon,
the poles and zeros of the boundary propagator in the complex  plane accumulate giving
rise to a cut. the appearence of the cut is the signal in the boundary theory of the

16

formation of the black hole horizon in the bulk. it is related to the fact that at the horizon
dierent boundary conditions (ingoing or outgoing waves) are appropriate on dierent
sides of the real -axis.
in our case these boundary conditions appear automatically
when the shell collapses. once the cut has formed it is meaningful to perform an analytic
continuation of the propagator below the real axis and then new poles can appear. in
ads3 only the thermal poles were found, but if we had performed the calculation in ads5
then the poles computed in [19] would have appeared after the collapse of the shell. let
us keep in mind that when we talk about collapse and motion of the shell, it is only
within the quasistatic approximation which from the boundary perspective is more akin
to a thermodynamic treatment than a true dynamical description.

an open question is that there appears to be two relevant timescales as the shell is
approaching the horizon. on one hand,  , the inverse of the imaginary part of a pole of
h, gives a timescale corresponding to the lifetime of the corresponding resonance. on the
other hand, the equation of motion for the shell (in this region) was approximately given
by the equation (1) with a characteristic timescale

h = 4th  rh .

(53)

it remains to be understood properly which one is the relevant timescale for the thermal-
ization in this case: the lifetime of the resonances, or the time for the collapse, and how
the latter could be found in the boundary theory.

our present understanding is then the following.

in the beginning, as the shell is
very large, and just begins to collapse, the boundary theory is very far from the thermal
equilibrium. the propagator reveals this by having a pole structure which is very dierent
from a thermal propagator. the poles correspond to an innite tower of resonances in
the boundary theory with masses proportional to the shell radius, and lifetimes inversely
proportional to it. as the collapse begins to speed up we cannot apply the quasistatic
analysis - there will be dynamical processes in the boundary theory which are beyond our
control at this stage. however, as a rst crude step, we can jump to the very end of the
collapse when a far-away observer at a xed radial distance would see the collapse to slow
down and freeze as the shell is approaching the horizon radius. at that stage, as a rough
approximation, we again apply the quasistatic analysis, in the large frequency domain.
now the boundary theory is approaching thermal equilibrium with deviations encoded
in the propagator. the poles and zeroes of the propagator ow towards the real axis
of the complex -plane, and nally degenerate into a cut with the propagator being the
thermal one. the full propagator is then dened either on the upper or lower half plane,
corresponding to a choice between a retarded or advanced propagator. a continuation
across the cut then reveals the thermal poles on the other half-plane. i.e. g =  a
is
analytically continued down through the cut into the lower half plane where one nds

a+

17

the thermal poles. so the propagator has, as promised, become a thermal (retarded or
advanced) propagator when the shell is innitesimally close to the horizon and hawking
radiation begins to leak out and ll the anti-de sitter space so that a thermal equilibrium
is established.

we emphasize that the propagator is just a measure of the properties of the state of
the boundary theory. the analysis does not tell us anything about how the thermalization
happens - there is no dynamical information about the boundary theory. this question is
tied up with going beyond the quasistatic approximation, where dynamical issues become
relevant. what one would need at that stage, is a kinetic theory for the thermalization
of the strongly coupled boundary theory. this seems to be an untractable problem at
the moment. one can speculate that the equations governing the thermalization of the
boundary theory would be a kinetic theory equivalent of the equations of motion of the
collapsing shell in the bulk. that is, if one were to understand the kinetic theory, one
should be able to reproduce the equation of the motion of the shell. further, it has
been suggested before [29, 30, 31, 32] that a holographic description of even the simplest
dynamical processes in the bulk can be very non-local - even a slighest innocuous looking
approximation on the boundary side might completely distort the bulk interpretation. the
same could be true about the kinetic theory / shell collapse duality. a small approximation
to the kinetic equations might completely mess up the bulk description of the collapse.

appendix

in section 3 we discussed how the series of poles and zeros of the propagator accumulate
on the real axis giving rise to a cut. to clarify how this happens we give in this appendix
a simpler example in which this occurs. consider the function

g(z) =

(z)
(z + 1
2)

(54)

where  is a positive real number ans z  c. the function g(z) has poles at z = n/
and zeros at z = (n + 1/2)/ with n a positive integer. when    the poles and

18

zeros accumulate on the negative real axis. in that limit and for  < arg(z) <  the
stirling approximation gives

lim


g(z) = lim


(z)
(z + 1
2)

= lim




(z)z1/2ez

(z + 1/2)zez1/2 =

1
z

(55)

the resulting function, 1/z has a cut which, as follows from the calculation, is placed on
the negative real axis. in fact this example arises when taking the large frequency limit
of the ads propagator in global coordinates. in that case one recovers the propagator in
poincare coordinates which has a cut on the positive real axis.
