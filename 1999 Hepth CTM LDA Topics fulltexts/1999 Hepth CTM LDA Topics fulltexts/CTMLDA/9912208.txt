(2.8) denes complex curve base. cases, although elliptic bers singular, full space described weierstrass model smooth. however, see below, weierstrass model may also singular. case, smooth calabiyau threefold x blow corresponding singular weierstrass model. 2.2 involutions construction z 1(z) = z2 unfortunately, one show elliptically bered calabiyau threefolds z trivial 1(z). one exception base b enriques surface. shown 9 {$9603142$} spectral cover constructions geometries cannot give models three families chiral matter. dierent constructions bundles geometries exist {$9603142$} seem allow enough exibility satisfying anomaly cancellation condition. hence, choose dierent route; keep bases general relax elliptic bration condition. easiest way produce bered space z non-trivial 1(z) quotienting elliptically bered space x freely-acting discrete symmetry. since consider simplest case 1(z) = z2, need nd elliptically bered manifold x freely-acting involution. specically, would like construct involution x : x x (2.9) preserves bration , well holomorphic volume form, acts freely x, is, without xed points. construct quotient space z = x/x. (2.10) since x acts freely preserves holomorphic volume form, z smooth calabiyau threefold. however, general, section x invariant x, descend section z. follows reason expect z section and, hence, elliptic bration. is, general, torus-bration. one construct involution constraints existence place x? easily analyzed constructing x combination two involutions, one acting base one acting ber. note, rst, involution x x preserves bration, must project involution b : b b (2.11) b. since x/x must smooth b/b, require b act freely b. fact, generally b admit freely-acting b. denote fb set points b xed b. general, fb contain either continuous nite set elements. fix one involution b. among calabi-yau manifolds x, bered b, want show involution b lifts involution : x x preserves section . combine involution bers, give 10 x. lifting possible bration invariant b. means coecients g2 g3 weierstrass equation must invariant b, b(g2) = g2, b(g3) = g3, (2.12) conditions satised, b indeed lifted involution : x x, uniquely determined additional requirements x zero section preserve holomorphic volume form x. local computation shows leaves xed whole ber xed point base, points fb . thus suitable candidate x. construct involution without xed points, combine translation ber. action translation smooth torus acts without xed points. one might expect simple translation elliptic bers x might give involution without xed points. problem translation might act freely singular bers. thus, general, translation alone candidate x either. however, one recalls left invariant bers points base fb . combine translation ber, then, provided none bers fb singular, resulting transformation act without xed points. let us specic. easiest (but general) way construct elliptically bered calabiyau threefold x ber translation symmetry require x two sections. zero section marks zero points pb bers 1(b). suppose second section . consider ber 1(b). denote b unique point intersection ber image (b) base x. let us assume that, point b b, b point order two ber, is, b + b = (b). terms sections themselves, written + = .

(2.18) combined action given (2.15), implies x interchanges two sections, x() = , x() = . (2.19) thus neither section preserved x and, consequently, quotient space z = x/x generically sections torus-bered. furthermore, since one show preserves holomorphic volume form, conclude x also preserves holomorphic volume form. x xed points x? general, answer armative. however, discussed above, none bers set xed points base fb singular action x free. thus x act freely x fb { = 0} = , (2.20) { = 0} discriminant locus base b. except case enriques base, implies fb must consist nite number xed points. furthermore, since x preserves bration x induces involution b b, follows z torus-bration base space = b/b.
