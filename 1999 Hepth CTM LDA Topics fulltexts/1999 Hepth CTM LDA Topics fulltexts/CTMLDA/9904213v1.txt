the partial breaking of supersymmetry in at space can be accomplished using any
one of three dual representations for the massive n = 1 spin-3/2 multiplet. each
of the representations can be unhiggsed, which gives rise to a set of dual n = 2
supergravities and supersymmetry algebras.

1 introduction

the transition from string theory to the standard model can be characterized in terms of
a hierarchy of supersymmetries: from n = 8 to n = 0. these supersymmetries must be
spontaneously broken, either all at once, to n = 0, or partially, rst to n = 1 (or higher)
and then to n = 0.

for phenomenological applications of weak-scale supersymmetry, one would like to
construct the eective eld theory that describes the breaking of n = 8 to n = 1. in this
paper we will focus on a simpler case, that of n = 2 broken to n = 1. we will construct
a set of eective supergravity theories that contain an unbroken, linearly realized n = 1
supersymmetry, as well as a spontaneously broken, nonlinearly realized, n = 2.

heuristically, it might seem impossible to partially break n = 2 to n = 1. the

argument runs as follows. start with the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra

{q, q } = 2 m
{s, s } = 2 m

  pm
  pm ,

(1)

where q and its conjugate q  denote the rst, unbroken supersymmetry, and s, s  the
second. suppose that one supersymmetry is not broken, so

q|0i = q|0i = 0 .

(2)

because of the supersymmetry algebra, this implies that the hamiltonian also annihilates
the vacuum,

then, according to the supersymmetry algebra,

h |0i = 0 .

for a positive denite hilbert space, this leads one to conclude that

( ss + s s) |0i = 0 .

s |0i = s |0i = 0 .

(3)

(4)

(5)

this argument can be evaded by two loopholes. the rst is that in a spontaneously
broken theory, one can only consider the algebra of the currents, since the charges of the
spontaneously broken symmetries do not exist rigorously. the second exploits the fact
that in covariantly-quantized supergravity theories, the gravitino m is a gauge eld with
negative-norm components, so the hilbert space does not have positive norm.

there are by now many examples of partial supersymmetry breaking which take advan-
tage the rst loophole. the rst was given by hughes, liu and polchinski [1], who showed
that supersymmetry is partially broken on the world volume of an n = 1 supersymmet-
ric 3-brane propagating in six-dimensional superspace. later, bagger and galperin [2, 3]
used the techniques of coleman, wess, zumino [4], and volkov [5] to construct an eective
eld theory of partial supersymmetry breaking, with the broken supersymmetry realized
nonlinearly. they found that the goldstone fermion could belong to an n = 1 chiral or an
n = 1 vector multiplet. antoniadis, partouche and taylor discovered another realization
in which the goldstone fermion is contained in an n = 2 vector multiplet [6].

1

each of these examples relies on the fact that in partially broken supersymmetry, the

current algebra can be modied as follows,

{ q , j 1
{ s , j 2

m} = 2 n
m} = 2 n

  tmn
  (v4mn + tmn) ,

(6)

where the j i
m (i = 1, 2) are the supercurrents and tmn is the stress-energy tensor. the
shift in the second stress-energy tensor in (6) prevents the current algebra from being
integrated into a charge algebra, and circumvents the no-go theorem.

in gravity, however, a shift in the stress-energy tensor corresponds to a shift in the
vacuum energy. this suggests that the mechanism of partial breaking might be dierent
in supergravity theories. indeed, theories with partial breaking were constructed by ce-
cotti, girardello and porrati, and by zinovev [7], starting from linearly realized n = 2
supergravity. (a geometrical interpretation was given in [8].) these authors considered
scenarios with vector- and hypermultiplets and found that the gravitational couplings ex-
ploited the second loophole. it is natural to ask whether their results apply more generally
in supergravity theories.

in this paper we will address this question using a model-independent approach with
a minimal eld content motivated by the superhiggs-eect. we will see that partial
breaking in at space can be accomplished using three dual representations for the n = 1
massive spin-3/2 multiplet. when coupled to gravity, the dual representations give rise
to new n = 2 supergravities with new n = 2 supersymmetry algebras.

in each case, our technique will be as follows: we will start with the lagrangian and
supersymmetry transformations for the massive n = 1 spin-3/2 multiplet. we shall then
unhiggs the representation by adding appropriate goldstone elds and coupling it to
gravity.

2.1 dual versions of massive n = 1 spin-3/2 multiplets

the starting point for our investigation is the massive n = 1 spin-3/2 multiplet. this
multiplet contains six bosonic and six fermionic degrees of freedom, arranged in states of
the following spins,

.

the traditional representation of this multiplet contains the following elds [9]: one spin-
3/2 fermion, one spin-1/2 fermion, and two spin-one vectors, each of mass m. the dual
representations have the same fermions, but one or two antisymmetric tensors in place
of one or two of the vectors. as we shall see, each representation gives rise to a distinct
n = 2 supersymmetry algebra.

the traditional representation is described by the following lagrangian [9],

here m is a spin-3/2 rarita-schwinger eld,  a spin-1/2 fermion, and am = am + ibm
a complex spin-one vector. this lagrangian is invariant under the following n = 1
supersymmetry transformations,

a dual lagrangian and its supersymmetry transformations can be found by using a
poincare duality which relates a massive vector eld to a massive antisymmetric tensor
eld of rank two. this duality can be used to relate the vector bm to an antisymmetric
tensor bmn by bmn = 1/m mnrsrbs or bm = vm/m [10].

a third representation can be found by dualizing the remaining vector, an. its deriva-

tion is straightforward, so we will not write its lagrangian and transformations here.

each of the three dual lagrangians describe the dynamics of free massive spin-3/2 and
1/2 fermions, together with their supersymmetric partners, massive spin-one vector and
tensor elds. they can be regarded as unitary gauge representations of theories with
additional symmetries: a fermionic gauge symmetry for the massive spin-3/2 fermion, as
well as additional gauge symmetries associated with the massive gauge elds.

2.2 unhiggsing massive n = 1 spin-3/2 multiplets

to study partial breaking, these lagrangians must be unhiggsed by including appropri-
ate gauge and goldstone elds. in each case we need to add a goldstone fermion and
goldstone bosons and then gauge the full n = 2 supersymmetry. in this way we can con-
struct theories with n = 2 supersymmetry nonlinearly realized, and n = 1 represented
linearly on the elds. the resulting eective eld theories describe the physics of partial
supersymmetry breaking, well below the scale where the second supersymmetry is broken.
in what follows we will focus on the rst two cases presented above; the example
with two antisymmetric tensors can be worked out in a similar fashion. in each case we
introduce goldstone elds by a stuckelberg redenition. we unhiggs the complex massive
vector am by replacing

in figure 1(a) the physical elds of the traditional representation for the massive spin-
3/2 multiplet are arranged in terms of massless n = 1 multiplets. the lowest superspins
form an n = 1 chiral and an n = 1 vector multiplet. these elds may be thought of

the n = 1 massive spin-3/2 multiplet.

as n = 1 matter. the remaining elds are the gauge elds of n = 2 supergravity. in
unitary gauge, the two vectors eat the two scalars, while the rarita-schwinger eld eats
one linear combination of the spin-1/2 fermions. this leaves the massive n = 1 multiplet
coupled to n = 1 supergravity. as we shall see, figure 1 only illustrates the eld content;
it does not describe the n = 1 multiplet structure of the unhiggsed theory.

for i = 1, 2. this result holds to leading order, that is, up to and including terms in the
transformations that are linear in the elds. note that this representation is irreducible
in the sense that there are no subsets of elds that transform only into themselves under
the supersymmetry transformations.

let us now consider the dual case with one massive tensor. the degree of freedom
counting is shown in figure 1(b). this time, however, the matter elds include an
n = 1 vector multiplet together with an n = 1 linear multiplet. in unitary gauge, one
vector eats one scalar, while the antisymmetric tensor eats the other vector. these are
the minimal set of elds that arise when coupling the alternative spin-3/2 multiplet to
n = 2 supergravity.

the lagrangian for this system can be worked out following the same procedures
described above. however, in the limit v2  0, the lagrangian and supersymmetry
transformations can also be derived by massless poincare duality. the dualities relating
a massless antisymmetric tensor bmn to a massless scalar  and a massless vector am
mn = 1/2 mnrsf ars. the supersymmetry
to another vector bm are vm = m and f b
transformations3 can be deduced by the method described in [13].

these elds form an irreducible representation of the n = 2 algebra.

each of the two lagrangians has a full n = 2 supersymmetry (up to the appropriate

3 dual algebras from partial supersymmetry break-

ing

now that we have explicit realizations of partial supersymmetry breaking, we can see
how they avoid the no-go argument presented in the introduction. we rst compute the
second supercurrent. in each case it turns out to be

m = v2 (6 i  m  + 4 mn2n) ,
j 2

(24)

plus higher-order terms. the commutator of the second supercharge with the second
supercurrent is then

{ s , j 2

m } = 0 + terms at least linear in the elds .

(25)

from this we see that the stress-energy tensors in the current algebra (6) do not dier
by a constant shift. the supergravity couplings must exploit the second loophole to the
no-go theorem.

to check this assertion, note that the operators j i

m and tmn contain contributions
from all of the elds, including the second gravitino. when covariantly-quantized, the
second gravitino gives rise to states of negative norm. indeed, we nd

even though

( ss + s s) |0i = 0 ,

s |0i 6= 0

s |0i 6= 0 .

(26)

(27)

to elucidate the role of the bosonic symmetries associated with partial supersymmetry
breaking, let us now compute the closure of the rst and second supersymmetry trans-
formations to zeroth order in the elds. in this way we can identify the goldstone elds
associated with any spontaneously broken bosonic symmetries.

for the traditional representation, (figure 1(a)), we nd
[ 1, 2]  = 22 v2 12
m (12) .
[ 1, 2] am =

4


(28)

this shows that the complex scalar  is indeed the goldstone boson for a gauged central
charge. moreover, in unitary gauge, where

 =  = 0 ,

(29)

this lagrangian reduces to the usual representation for a massive n = 1 spin-3/2 multiplet
[9].

for the dual representation (figure 1(b)), we have

[ 1, 2]  = 2 v2 (12 + 1 2)

[ 2, 1] am =

[ 2, 1] bm = 2 i v2 (2m 1  1m 2)

the real vector (am  bm)/2 is the goldstone boson for a gauged vectorial central

extension of the n = 2 algebra. in addition, the real scalar  is the goldstone boson
associated with a single real gauged central charge. in unitary gauge, with

1

(am  bm) =  =  = 0 ,

(31)

this lagrangian reduces to the dual representation for the massive n = 1 spin-3/2 mul-
tiplet [12].

finally, for the case with two tensors amn = amn + ibmn and two goldstone vectors

am = am + ibm, the algebra is

[2, 1]am =

d[m(2n] 1),
[2, 1]amn = 


this case requires two vectorial central extensions of the supersymmetry algebra.

4 discussion and conclusion

in this paper we have examined the partial breaking of supersymmetry in at space. we
have seen that partial breaking can be accomplished using either of three representations
of the massive n = 1 spin-3/2 multiplet. we unhiggsed the representations, and found a
new n = 2 supergravity and a new n = 2 supersymmetry algebra.

each of these theories gives rise to dierent n = 1 multiplet structures in the limit
  0. for the traditional representation, we nd a massless chiral multiplet, (, ),
together with a pair of twisted massless n = 1 multiplets, (2
m, am, ). the twisted
multiplets transform irreducibly into each other under the rst, unbroken supersymmetry.
they can be untwisted with the help of a second unbroken supersymmetry which appears
in this limit.4 the second supersymmetry transformations are obtained from (17) (in the
  0 limit) by am  am,   . we see that the twisted multiplet is actually a
massless n = 2 multiplet.
in the case of the dual representation, the n = 1 transformations (20) reduce, in the
  0 limit, to those of a massless vector multiplet, (bm, ), a linear multiplet, (, bmn,
), and a massless spin-3/2 multiplet, (2
m, am).5 this multiplet structure can also be
obtained by an explicit supereld unhiggsing of the massive spinor supereld  in the
ogievetsky/sokatchev formulation [12],

where v is a real vector and l a chiral spinor supereld; w and l are the corresponding
eld strengths. the correct multiplet structure is obtained in the limit m  0. note,
however, that the auxiliary superspin-0 is lost so we expect 1/m singularities in the
supersymmetry transformations.

the multiplet structure of the dual theory with two antisymmetric tensors consists of
the n = 2 representation, (2
m, am + ibm = am, ), as well as a linear multiplet with
two antisymmetric tensors, (, amn + ibmn = amn). the argument that prevents the
coupling of this multiplet to supergravity (see [15] and references therein) does not apply
here since the non-closure terms in the supersymmetry algebra are cancelled by terms
from the variation of 2
m.

the lagrangian for the traditional representation is a truncation of the supergravity
coupling found by cecotti, girardello, and porrati, and by zinovev [7]. their results were
based on linear n = 2 supersymmetry; they involved at least one n = 2 vector-multiplet
and one hypermultiplet. the lagrangians for the dual cases are new. they contain new
realizations of n = 2 supergravity.

in each case, the couplings presented here are minimal and model-independent. they
describe the superhiggs eect in the low-energy eective theories that arise from partial
supersymmetry breaking.
