abstract. we present a representation independent solution to the continuum
schwinger model in light-cone (a+ = 0) gauge. we then discuss the problem of nd-
ing that solution using various quantization schemes. in particular we shall consider
equal-time quantization and quantization on either characteristic surface, x+ = 0 or
x = 0.

introduction

we shall give a solution to the light-cone gauge schwinger model in the continuum
[1]. in early light-cone meetings many people gave talks on the schwinger model
and a number of papers were published. all of these solutions made use of periodicy
conditions to regulate the infrared singularities of the schwinger model. since a
solution with nice periodicity conditions on a space-like surface does not posess nice
periodicity conditions on a light-like surface (or even another space-like surface) the
comparisons of quantization on a light-like surface with quantization on a space-like
surface were never direct. since the continuum is the continuum on any surface,
in the present paper we shall be able to compare quantizaton proceedures which
must arrive at a common solution.

some of the points we will make about the various cases are as follows:

for equal-time quantization we nd

easy formulation
difficult solution
complex, dynamically determined vacuum

for light-cone (x+ = 0) quantization we nd

more difficult formulation
easier solution
vacuum fixed by kinematics and gauge invariance

for light-cone (x = 0) quantization (note that in the continuum this is precisely
the same as quantizing on x+ = 0 but in the gauge a = 0  the anti-light-cone
gauge) we nd

unfamiliar formulation
unfamiliar degrees of freedom
easier solution
vacuum fixed by kinematics and gauge invariance

an important point is that even though the vacuum is xed by kinematics in both
the light-cone representations, physical quantities such as the chiral condensate are
dynamical just as they are in the equal-time representation.

the solution contains elds which are functions of x+; they therefore appear
as dynamical elds when quantized on t = 0, zero-mode elds when quantized
on x+ = 0 and static elds when quantized on x = 0. we shall emphasize the
essential nature of these elds to the solution and shall argue that it is natural and
not dicult to include them in any of the quantization schemes.

in these equations,  is a massive ( e ) pseudoscalar;  is the x+-dependent piece
of a massless scalar and  is the x+-dependent piece of a massless ghost. these last
two elds are regulated with the klaiber procedure; for example

(+)(x+) = i(4) 1

we again wish to emphasize that the above soloution is representation inde-
pendent. it is not light-cone quantized or equal-time quantized but is simply the
answer. any quantization scheme is an attempt to nd that answer.

role of the zero-mode fields

we shall refer to the x+-dependent elds as zero-mode elds, although they are
such only if quantizing on x+ = 0. the only operators in the above solution which
carry a charge are the spurions, + and 

dk1k1

1 {(k1)  (k1)}i
0 {d(k1)  d(k1)}i

+ = exphi{q5 + q}(4m)1 +z 
 = exphi{q5  q}(4m)1 +z 

0

0

the charges themselves are made up entirely from operators from the zero-mode

elds. we have



q = z 
q5 = z 



m+(  )dx+
m+( + )dx+




= 1


[q, +] = [q, 


+] = 0

[q5, +] = 2+ ; [q5, 


+] = 2


+

without the zero-mode elds the model would be electrodynamics without charges.
the spurions (made from zero-mode operators) are the generators of large gauge
transformations and are necessary to create a gauge invariant vacuum and therefore,
to give a gauge invariant solution. we have

(+) a+ (+


) = a+ +

sin x+



so the vacuum must be an eigenstate of +.
given by

in fact, the physical vacuum is

|()i 



xm =

eim |(m)i

;

|(m)i = (+)m|0i

this family of vectors are the only gauge invariant vectors which satisfy

(+)|0i = (+)|0i = (+)|0i = q5|0i = 0

(1)

it is particularly easy to calculate the chiral condensate in light-cone gauge and

obtain

h()| |()i = 

m
2

e cos 

the zero-mode elds also play an essential role in regulating the operator products
in the theory. to illustrate this fact consider the product of + with its conjugate

h+(x + )+(x)i

this behavior allows us to dene a gauge invariant fermi product. but it comes
about through the combination

h: ei2 (x+) :: ei2 (x) :i  e2 4

m2

with

hei2()(x+)+ei2(+)(x+)ei2()(x)+ei2(+)(x)i  e+

without the zero-mode eld the operator product would be too singular to treat.

with it we can dene

:: = lim

 v.e.v.)

which allows the existence of the operator solution. the zero-mode elds enter
the solution in other, essential ways, but we shall now proceed to nding the solution
by formulating the problem in the various quantization schemes.

quantizing the model

looking at the solution we see that it is straightforward to quantize the model

on t = 0. the degrees of freedom are

the quantization follows completely standard lines. we initialize + and write

it in the bosonized basis.

+ ; a+ ; a ; 

+ = z+e()

+ +e(+)

+

(+)(0, x1) = i(4) 1

2 z 

0

dk1k1

1 c(k1)(cid:16)eik1x1

 (  k1)(cid:17)

looking at the solution we see that, in terms of the modes which diagonalize the

poincare generators we have

c(k1) = (k1) +s|k1|



((k1) + (k1))

from (1) we see that

c(k1)|0eti = a(+)

+ |0eti = (+)

a |0eti = 0 ;

|0eti 6= |0i

not only is the physical vacuum not the perturbative vacuum in the equal-time
basis, it is extremely complicated, projecting on to every basis vector allowed by
kinematics and the charge super selection rule. in addition, the problem of nding
the eigenstates of the hamiltonian is a complicated dynamical problem.

we now consider the problem of quantizing the model on the surface x+ = 0.

the degrees of freedom are

+ ;  ; 

the main subtlety encountered in this quantization scheme is not the existence
if these elds are left out a solution cannot be found;
of the zero-mode elds.
but the elds are right there in the lagrangian, the fact that they are zero-mode
elds is easily learned from the equations of motion and the algebra of the zero
mode elds can be determined by fairly straightforward procedures. the most
serious problem is that the fermi product cannot be regulated by splitting in the
x direction. there are various ways to get around the diculty. here we will
describe one which involves over regulating the theory, solving the dynamics then
removing the over-regulation.

we rst use the equations of motion to discover the dependence of + on :

2+a+ =  + m+(x) 

m2
2

a+(x)

= a+  m+

i++ = e+a+

= + = ei2((x+))r

where we have dened r simply to be the rest of +. we nd that r satises
the canonical commutation relations on x+ = 0 so we initialize it as

{r(x+, x), r(x+, y)} = (x  y)

r(0, x) = zexp[2i ()(0, x)]+exp[2i (+)(0, x)]
+ = exphi{ q5 + q}(4m)1 +z 
0 {c(k1)  c(k1)}i
0 c(k1)(cid:16)eikx  (  k0)(cid:17)

(+)(x) = i(4) 1

we now calculate p+

p+ =

m2

4 z 



2dx +z 

{(+)2  (+)2}dx+

since this operator is already diagonal, we now know the space-time dependence
of +. as it stands the construction is not translationally invariant. but we
can now dene fermi products by splitting in a space-like direction and recover
covariance by taking the limit

lim   0 = + = z+e()

+ +e(+)

+

we note that here, |0i is the perturbative vacuum so that the physical vacuum,
|i, is set by kinematics and gauge invariance. in the same way we can discover that
h| |i 6= 0. but we cannot calculate the value of the condensate from kinematics
and gauge invariance: the value depends on the + wavefunction renormalization
constant and that quantity is determined by maintaining the canonical commu-
tation relation for + with the product dened by space-like splittings  which
requires a dynamical calculation.

we now turn to the problem of quantization on the surface x = 0  the anti-

light-cone gauge. the degrees of freedom are

 ; a+ ; a+

a very unusual feature here is that not only is + not a degree of freedom, it is not
a constraint which must be resolved prior to solving for the dynamics of the degrees
of freedom. indeed, + must be solved for at the very end of the calculation, as
we shall discuss below. a very important feature of this formulation is that the
 products can be dened by splitting in the initial value surface. we can thus
calculate

j+(x) = lim
y+x+

(x+)(y+)exp[iez x+

perhaps the main subtlety of the current formulation is not to be too quick to

think that a+ and a+ are canonical conjugates. indeed, although

[a+(x+, x), a+(y+, x)] = 0

and

we have

[a+(x+, x), a+(y+, x)] = 

i
2

(x+  y+)
m2
16

(x+  y+)

[a+(x+, x), a+(y+, x)] = i

this problem is mearly a matter of being careful; the correct algebra can be ob-
tained either by forcing agreement between the heisenberg equations and the equa-
tions of motion or by the dirac procedure.

combining the last equation with

gives

p = z 



(a+)2dx+

a+(x) = 

m

again the dynamical operator is diagonal in the degrees of freedom. from

we get

or

2+a= =  + m+(x) 

m2

a+

a+(x) =

2
m2{ + m+( + )}

a+ =

2
m

+(  + )

we now turn to the problem of constructing +. we do that through the equation

i++ = e+a+

formally, this equation is easy to solve. in doing so we encounter some singular
objects; but if we stick to the plan of regulating ultraviolet singularities by space-
like point splitting, infrared singularities by a klaiber subtraction and dening
exponentials by wick ordering, we recover the correct solution.
