abstract

the non-renormalization of the 3-point functions htrx k1 trx k2 trx k3i of chiral
primary operators in n = 4 super-yang-mills theory is one of the most striking facts
to emerge from the ads/cft correspondence. a twofold puzzle appears in the
extremal case, e.g. k1 = k2 + k3. first, the supergravity calculation involves analytic
continuation in the ki variables to dene the product of a vanishing bulk coupling and
an innite integral over ads. second, extremal correlators are uniquely sensitive to
mixing of the singletrace operators trx k with protected multi-trace operators in the
same representation of su (4). we show that the calculation of extremal correlators
from supergravity is subject to the same subtley of regularization known for 2-point
functions, and we present a careful method which justies the analytic continuation
and shows that supergravity elds couple to single traces without admixture. we

also study extremal n-point functions of chiral primary operators, and argue that
type iib supergravity requires that their space-time form is a product of n  1 two
point functions (as in the freeeld approximation) multiplied by a nonrenormalized
coecient. this nonrenormalization property of extremal npoint functions is a
new prediction of the ads/cft correspondence. as a by-product of this work we
obtain the cubic couplings t and s of elds in the dilaton and 5-sphere graviton
towers of type iib supergravity on ads5  s5.

1 introduction

the study of correlation functions of operators in the boundary theory is one useful way
to explore the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] (see [4] for a comprehensive review).
when applied to type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 this study has uncovered several
previously unknown properties of the d = 4, n = 4, superyangmills (sym) theory
with gauge group su(n). in the important calculation of [5], 3point functions of the
n = 4 chiral primary operators trx k  tr{x i1(x)x i2(x)   x ik(x)} (in the symmetric
traceless representation of su(4) with dynkin label (0, k, 0)) were computed at strong
coupling using supergravity, and found to exactly agree at large n with the free eld
approximation to the sym theory.

upon closer examination of the computation of [5], one nds a curious puzzle in the
case of extremal 3point functions, namely correlators htrx k1trx k2trx k3i in which the
conformal dimension of one of the operators is precisely equal to the sum of the other two
dimensions, e.g. k1 = k2 + k3. (these values of ki are extremal in the sense that for
k1 > k2 + k3 the 3point function vanishes by su(4) selection rules.) after dimensional
k were dened
reduction of the eld equations of the type iib supergravity, scalar elds s
and found to have a simple cubic interaction of the form g(k1, k2, k3)s
in the

k1s
extremal case k1 = k2 + k3 the coupling g(k2 + k3, k2, k3) vanishes but the integral over
ads5 needed to compute the 3point functions diverges [6].

k3.

one way around the problem (which was implicitly used in [5] and [7] and that has been
recently emphasized in [8]) is to analytically continue in the conformal dimensions k1, k2,
k3. as k1  k2+k3 the ads integral computed in [6] diverges as 1/(k1k2k3). in the same
limit the supergravity coupling goes to zero as k1  k2  k3. thus by analytic continuation
one obtains a nite result for the extremal 3point functions. this is the answer quoted in
[5] which matches the free eld result. although analytic continuation may be regarded as
a regularization procedure, it lacks rigourous justication since su(4) symmetry requires
integer dimensions and thus integer ki. additionally, the singularity of the integral over
ads5 arises from the region where the bulk interaction point approaches the boundary. in
similar situations encountered previously [2, 6] a regularization procedure using a space-
time cuto inside the boundary was used and found to give satisfactory results. in this
case, however, the extremal correlators would vanish for any nite value of the cuto and
also in the limit as the cuto is removed. thus the puzzle is to nd a method to compute
the extremal correlators from rst principles, working at exact extremality with denite
integer values of k2, k3, k1 = k2 + k3, and we propose such a method in this paper.

a further motivation for considering extremal correlators arises from eld theory. it is
k are dual to the single trace operators
k and trx k belong to the same short representation of the governing

customarily believed that the supergravity elds s
trx k. indeed both s

2

superalgebra su(2, 2|4) and have protected scale dimension  = k. however, it has
been recognized [9, 10, 11], but not widely considered so far, that certain multitrace
operators are also bps operators with protected dimensions.
in addition to the single
trace chiral primary tr{x i1(x)x i2(x)   x ik (x)} one may consider, for example, double
trace bps operators of the form tr{x i1(x)x i2(x)   x ikl(x)}tr{x j1(x)x j2(x)   x jl(x)},
in the same (0, k, 0) su(4) representation. projection into this representation is obtained
by the same process of total symmetrization in the indices im and removal of traces that is
used for trx k itself. more generally, one can consider higher order multitrace operators,
schematically denoted by trx k1trx k2    trx km, projected into the representation (0, k =
k1+k2+   km, 0). all of these operators transform in the same representation of su(2, 2|4)
as the single trace trx k, so we would expect these operators to mix, and, indeed, mixing is
required by the general structure of operator product expansions in the sym theory. (the
relevance of multitrace operators for the ads5/cf t4 correspondence on the coulomb
branch has been noted in [12] and [13].)

one is thus naturally led to speculate that supergravity elds couple to linear combina-
tions of single and multiple trace bps operators. in the free eld approximation, one can
easily see that operator mixing occurs, although generically suppressed by powers of 1/n.
thus one might get the impression that the issue of whether supergravity elds couple to
single trace operators or to admixtures with protected multi-traces is a non-leading eect
of secondary concern in the ads/cft correspondence. however, extremal correlators are
exceptional: the contribution of multitrace operators to extremal 3point functions is
enhanced and of the same order in n as single traces. it is quite curious that multi-trace
admixtures are important in exactly the same situation where there is an ambiguity in the
calculation of correlation functions. thus in order to decide whether multitrace admix-
tures are present in the ads/cft correspondence, it is crucial to have a reliable scheme
for computing extremal correlators in supergravity.

in this paper, we will address these issues through a concrete supergravity calculation.
we will compute the 3point functions hok1
t are the sym
operators that couple respectively to kaluzaklein modes of the dilaton  and of the
supergravity scalar eld t (a linear combination of the 4form and of the trace of the
graviton with indices on the s5). one motivation for considering this example (which
has also been recently studied in [8]) is that the details of the dimensional reduction are
somewhat simpler than in the chiral primary computation of [5]. in particular, no subtlety
related to the selfduality condition of the 4form arises, and we will be able to work always
at the level of an explicit action. since the 3-point functions of primary and descendent
operators are related by supersymmetry transformations, it is quite clear that our method
can be applied to primary correlators also.

it should be noted that two sets of scalar elds were considered in [5]. the dimensional

3

reduction procedure initially leads to equations of motion for elds sk with both derivative
and nonderivative interactions. a nonlinear transformation to the s
k elds then elim-
inates the derivative couplings. in the descendent sector we work with elds which are
analogous to the sk and have both derivative and nonderivative couplings. the interac-
tion lagrangian is then manipulated by partial integration and use of the linear equations
of motion. the value of the onshell action (as a functional of boundary data) is expressed
as the sum of nonderivative cubic bulk coupling plus certain cubic couplings which are
total derivatives or boundary interactions. we then compute 3-point correlation functions
using the two methods of analytic continuation and spacetime cuto.

we nd that in the nonextremal cases k1 < k2 + k3 the contribution of the boundary
interactions vanishes as the cuto is removed, and the net contribution of the bulk vertex
is completely unambiguous. at extremality, however, the bulk coupling constants vanish
as in the calculation of [5] in the chiralprimary sector. so the cuto method gives a
vanishing bulk contribution, but one of the boundary vertices gives a nonvanishing result.
this result is then compared with the limit k1  k2 + k3 of the analytically continued
nonextremal correlator, and we nd exact agreement.

our results provide a justication, at least in this example, for the analytic continuation
procedure used in [5] and advocated in [8]. we expect a very similar situation to occur
in the chiral primary computation of [5]. namely, the extremal 3point functions could
in principle be obtained from a boundary interaction of the original elds sk that directly
arise from the dimensional reduction. in the change of variables to the new elds s
k (equ.
(3.36) of [5]), these boundary terms are removed and the naive coupling appears to be zero
in the extremal case. however, we expect analytic continuation to extremality to give the
same answer as a calculation at exact extremality with boundary interactions.

our analysis thus indicates that the elds sk couple to single trace operators only,
although admixtures of multitrace operators might have been expected. if the new pro-
cedure had led to values of extremal correlators dierent from those obtained from analytic
continuation then one would have to add multi-trace admixtures to explain the dierence.
since this does not happen, we must conclude that the customary map to single trace
operators is correct, or that if present doubletraces are suppressed (like 1/n 2).

we also consider extremal npoint functions of chiral primary operators. analysis of
the supergravity interactions allows us to prove (under reasonable assumption about the
supergravity lagrangian) that the functional form (that is, the dependence on spacetime
coordinates) of these correlators in the strong coupling limit is the same as in the free eld
approximation. arguments based on the operator product expansion can then be used to
show that the coecient of this functional form satises a nonrenormalization theorem
and is independent of the coupling  = g2n.

a curious subtlety emerges from our calculation of extremal 3-point functions. the

4

initially derived interaction lagrangian for the bulk elds is the sum of two bulk vertices,
one with two derivatives and one with four derivatives. each vertex contributes to an
extremal 3-point function via a bulk integral which diverges logaritmically as the bulk
point z = (z0, zi) approaces the boundary at zo = 0. the divergence cancels in the sum
of the two integrals, but regularization by a simple cuto at w0 =  does not give the
same result for the correlator as the method described above in which dirichlet boundary
conditions were imposed. thus extremal 3-point functions are a new example of the
subtlety in the regularization of 2-point functions discussed in [3, 6, 13]. formally 2-point
functions, eg < ok1
 >, are also extremal, since k1 = k2 is required by conformal
symmetry.

 ok2

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we present some results, part new and
part review, concerning the mixing of single and multi-trace operators in the sym eld
theory. section 3 contains our treatment of 3-point correlators in the t   descendent
sector of type iib supegravity, and section 4 describes the extension of our ideas to
extremal npoint functions.

2 multitrace bps operators and mixing

we denote normalized single trace chiral primary operators by

ok(x) =

1
n k/2 tr{x i1(x)x i2(x)   x ik (x)}

(2.1)

in which it is understood that the tensor is totally symmetric and traceless in the su(4)
indices i = 1,   , 6. the double-trace product of two such operators oj(x)okj(x) trans-
forms as the direct sum of the irreducible representations of su(4) in the tensor product
(0, j, 0)  (0, k  j, 0). the tensor product always contains, with unit multiplicity, the
representation with dynkin label (0, k, 0), and the projection into this representation is
obtained by symmetrization and removal of traces. similar remarks apply to the order m
multi-trace operator ok1ok2   okm, with k = k1 + k2 +    + km, which also contains the
representation (0, k, 0) with unit multiplicity. we denote these highest weight components
of the direct product by

[ok(x)o(x)]max  [ok(x)o(x)](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(0,k+,0)

.

(2.2)

(2.3)

[ok1(x)  okm(x)]max  [ok1(x)  okm(x)](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(0,k1++km,0)

there is a simple bps argument that all of these operators transform in the unique
short representation of su(2, 2|4) whose lowest weight component is a scalar operator in
the (0, k, 0) representation of su(4), of scale dimsnsion  = k. indeed, these operators

5

must be lowest weight, since they are totally symmetric in avor indices, and there can be
no appearance of descendents by using the eld equations of the interacting sym theory.
a complete classication of unitary representations of su(2, 2|4) was given in [14]. for
the representations with su(4) quantum numbers (0, k, 0) of the lowest dimension (scalar)
component in the multiplet, two possible types appear : (1) there is a bps multiplet with
dimension  = k, (2) there is a continuous family of representations with   k + 2. the
above operators [ok1   okm] all have the property that at vanishing sym coupling,  = k,
and thus are in representations of the type (1). assuming continuity of the dimension as
a function of g, we see that the operators have to be of type (1) for all values of g, and
are thus bps. a somewhat dierent argument was given in [11].

next, we show that mixing of single and doubletrace operators is a rigorous conse-
quence of the operator product expansion in conformal eld theory. first we observe that
the operator product expansion ok2(y)ok3(z) contains the (non-leading) term

ok2(y)ok3(z)  [ok2(y)ok3(y)]max

(2.4)

with unit coecient as z  y, since the operator [ok2(y)ok3(y)]max is actually dened
by the short distance limit. from the z  y limit of the extremal 3point function
(k1 = k2 + k3)

hok1(x)ok2(y)ok3(z)i =

one nds the exact result

c

(x  y)2k2(x  z)2k3

(2.5)

(2.6)

hok1(x)[ok2(y)ok3(y)]maxi =

c

(x  y)2k1

which shows that the mixed two-point function is non-vanishing and has the same non
renormalization properties as the extremal 3point function.

2.1 large n counting

we now apply large n counting arguments to obtain the order in n of the various corre-
lation functions of interest in this paper. to do this one can convert free eld feynman
diagrams involving adjoint scalars into fundamental planar quark diagrams in which each
closed quark loop gives a factor of n. planar interaction diagrams then have the same
net power of n if the t hooft coupling  = g2n is xed. actually, if the order 2 non
renormalization results of [16] for singletrace correlators and the new results of [11] for
correlators of protected multitrace operators hold in higher order, then free eld diagrams
tell the whole story. in the formulas below we give the power of n associated with the
various correlators of interest in this paper (other factors are usually omitted).

it then follows that the operators ok in (2.1) have unit

(x  y)2k .

(2.8)

large n counting then tells us that mixed 2-point functions of single trace operators and
protected multi-traces are suppressed by further powers of n, specically (for k = k1 + k2,
etc.)

(2.9)

thus there is operator mixing even at the free-eld level in the sym theory. the matrix
of 2-point functions is diagonalized by eigen-combinations of operators with leading term
ok plus admixtures of [ok1ok2...okm]max with coecients of order 1/n m1.
it is thus
suggestive, although logically independent, that supergravity elds sk or s
k couple to
similar linear combinations in the ads5/cf t4 correspondence, and this hypothesis is
explored in the next section.

for 3-point correlators, large n quark loop counting (and su(4) avor invariance) give

the results

if k1 < k2 + k3 or k1 = k2 + k3 , l 6= k2, k3.

(2.10)

the last equation shows that the correlators hok1ok2ok3i and hpl

n [olok1l]maxok2ok3i
are comparable in the extremal case k1 = k2 + k3 (and the leading contribution in the
second one comes from l = k2 or l = k3), while for k1 < k2 + k3 the second correlator
is o(1/n 2) compared to the rst. thus extremal 3point functions are special in the
sense that doubletrace operators give an enhanced contribution. this means that the
agreement between supergravity and freeeld theory for non-extremal correlators does not
test the possible coupling to multitrace operators, and a reliable method of computation
of extremal correlators is required.

a similar situation holds for (connected) extremal 4point functions of single and multi

trace operators. for example

3.1 setup

we closely follow [15]. we adopt almost uniformly the conventions introduced in [5], which
we recall here for the readers convenience. however, unlike [15] and [5] we will work with
euclidean signature.

we use latin indices i, j, k, . . . for the whole 10dimensional manifold. indices , , , . . .
are s5 indices, while , , , . . . are ads5 indices. gmn indicates the metric and gmn its
background value. we set the s5 and ads5 scales to 1, i.e. we use units such that the
riemann tensor for the background solution takes the form

r = (gg  gg), r = (gg  gg) .

we set

gmn = gmn + hmn,

h = h() +

the equations of motion that follow from supergravity yield some constraints between
the modes dened above. it was shown in [15][5] that if we excite the eld h2 then the

analysis of the extremal 3point functions.

spherical harmonics. the spherical harmonics are normalised (following [5], appendix b)
such that

we now observe that the boundary integrals found in the last step in (3.29) cannot con-
tribute to the 3point function if all the three points are disjoint1. this is the case because

interaction proposed in appendix a of [24].

where k is the propagator from a boundary point x to a bulk point z, and it is assumed
in the above equation that we take the limit z  x. but now note that if we vary such a
contribution to the action with respect to the boundary values of the elds, we will obtain
a nonzero value only if two of the points where we consider eld variations are coincident
(namely, t he points where the elds tk1 and k3 are varied). we will be interested only in
the values of the correlators for separated points. thus terms of the form of the boundary
integrals in (3.29) will always be dropped.

3.6 computing the 3point function

there are two kinds of terms in (3.36)  a bulk vertex and a boundary term. we imagine
carrying out the evaluation of the action in some large but nite region of ads space, with

12

the values of the elds xed at the boundary of this region. varying the value of the action
with respect to the appropriate elds at chosen points on the boundary we will obtain the
3point function.

we will nd that the case k1 < k2 + k3 and the case k1 = k2 + k3 (the extremal
case) need to be analyzed somewhat dierently. in the rst case, it is easy to see that the
boundary integral vanishes as we take the size of the ads region to innity, faster than
the expected scaling of the three point function. the bulk integral gives a nonvanishing
result, which scales exactly as expected for the 3point function of the boundary cft.

in the extremal case, on the other hand, we nd that the coecient of the bulk integral
is zero. the boundary term in this case gives a nonzero contribution however, since it scales
in exactly the manner expected of the 3point function. evaluating this boundary integral
needs some care, and we will carry out the evaluation below.

3.6.1 the threepoint function for k1 < k2 + k3
we dene ok
elds k and tk with strength 1, i.e. we let the source terms in the action be

t as the operators that couple to the boundary value of the supergravity

 and ok

z d4x tk(x)ok

(3.37)

the bulk integral over ads5 in (3.36) was evaluated in [6], equation (25), for elds of
generic dimensions i. it suces to note that the conformal dimensions i of tk1, k2 and
k3 are related to the kk levels ki through

1 = k1 + 8 2 = k2 + 4 3 = k3 + 4 .

(3.38)

then we nd that the threepoint function is

3.6.2 the extremal case k1 = k2 + k3

in this case the coecient of the bulk integral in (3.36) vanishes. the contribution comes
from the boundary term, which must be regulated and calculated carefully. we introduce
a cuto at z0 = , where z0, zi are the coordinates of the usual upper half-plane metric for
ads, and require that bulk elds satisfy a dirichlet boundary value problem there. this
is a geometrically well dened prescription, and leads to the free solution

tk(z) = z d4x k 

(z, x)tk(x)

(3.41)

(z, x) is the poisson/dirichlet kernel for the cuto space-time and tk(x) is the
where k 
boundary source for tk(z). a similar equation holds for k(z). we must insert the free
solution into 3.27 or 3.36 and obtain the contribution to the action functional which is
cubic order in the sources.

a certain diculty now emerges. both bulk integrals in (3.27) are convergent for
regular boundary data, i.e. smeared sources, but the integral from the interaction vertex
with four derivatives diverges for point sources, i.e. tk(x)  4(x  x). the divergence
comes from the region where z is very close to the insertion point x where k 
(z, x) can
be well approximated by its at space form

()

(z0  )

[(z0  )2 + (z  x)2]5/2 .

(3.42)

this divergence for point sources is an artefact of the cuto procedure which would occur
for all values of the ki, not just extremal cases.

in the appendix the behavior of the singular integral is studied for smeared sources
which are peaked about the nal boundary insertion points. it is shown that the point
source limit is well dened, i.e. nite and independent of details of the smearing.
in
particular this means that the contribution to the integral of a small strip  < z0 < 
vanishes as   0.

while the appendix explains that the integral is well dened, a position space approach
does not give an easy way to calculate the 3-point function. instead we used the fourier
transform, since plane waves may be viewed as particular choices of smeared sources for
which both the bulk integrals of 3.27 converge. for example the fourier transform of
k 

(z, x) is well known to be [2, 6]

where k is the modied bessel function of index , and d is the boundary dimension of
adsd+1. (we will specialize to d = 4 in our nal result for the correlator.) we see that

14

(p) admits derivatives of arbitrary order with respect to z0 which have smooth limits

k 
to the boundary at z0 = .

the partial integrations of section 3.5 are valid with plane wave sources, so that in
the end it is just the fourier transform of the boundary interaction in (3.36) that must
be calculated.
it is easy to see that the derivatives in (3.36) which are parallel to the
boundary vanish faster in the eventual limit   0 than those in the normal direction, so
we keep only the dominant z0 derivatives. the 3-point correlator in momentum space is
just a product of three k 

(p) with normal derivatives applied.

we use the asymptotic formula

where the rst . . . refer to positive integer powers of p and the second . . . to terms containing
ln(p) times higher powers of p. the coecient a is easily obtained from standard

treatments of bessel functions, but for our purposes it suces to recall that a p2(

as in previous p-space calculations of 2-point functions we have kept the leading term as
  0 which is nonanalytic in both p2 and p3. an interesting feature of this term is
that it depends on p2 and p3 in a factorized way:
it is in fact the fourier transform of
a product of two 2point functions. the factor 22+232d provides the correct scaling
behavior (namely, o(1+2+32d)) for a 3point function of operators of dimension 2,
3, 1 = 2 + 3. observe that in the nonextremal cases 1 < 2 + 3 the boundary
term (3.46) scales too fast to give a contribution.

from (3.46) and (3.45), taking into account the overall coecient in the boundary

term of the action (3.36), we nally get for the 3point function

one might have thought that a simpler way to calculate the extremal 3-point function
is to calculate the two bulk integrals in (3.27) using a simple cuto at z0 =  with standard

(3.47)

each integral is logarithmically divergent, but the divergence cancels in the sum. the
nal result depends on how the integrals are cut o, and we discuss two methods. first
one can continue k1 into the convergent region k1 < k2 + k3 so that each integral contains
a pole 1/(k2 + k3  k1) which cancels between them. the nal result agrees with (3.48)
for non-extremal correlators and its continuation to the extremal case agrees with (3.42).
this tests the equivalence of the actions (3.27) and (3.36) in the non-extremal region,
but it does not give an independent evaluation of the extremal case. the second method
is to cut o each divergent integral at z0 = , do the integrals over the 4 coordinates
zi, and then observe that the divergent part near z0 = 0 cancels in the integrand when
both contributions are combined. the nal result then does not agree with the method
of analytic continuation. however, the situation of two cancelling divergent integrals is
very similar to that of 2-point functions [3, 6, 13], and we believe that it is incorrect to
use a simple cuto without imposing dirichlet boundary conditions. in the case of 2-point
functions it was shown [6] that the supergravity calculation of a 3-point function of a
current and two scalar operators is unambiguous. the ward identity then gave a scalar 2-
point function which agreed with the calculation by the dirichlet method. in the present
case we suggest that the 4-point function of a current and an extremal combination of
scalar operators will also be unambiguous, and the ward identity will lead to an extremal
3-point correlator which agrees with (3.47).

3.7 discussion

the agreement of extremal 3point functions calculated by the two methods of analytic
continuation in the scale dimensions ki and carefully regulated boundary interaction is
the principal result of this section. the result was obtained in a descendent sector of the
theory because it was technically easier to nd the interaction lagrangian. however, the
3-point correlators of chiral primary operators and their descendents are related by n = 4
supersymmetry transformations, so our computations also justify the previous calculation
of hok1ok2ok3i obtained in [5] by (implicit) analytic continuation. the agreement with
free eld theory results then shows that the elds sk used in [5] couple only to the single
trace operators ok rather than to admixtures with protected multitrace operators. a
3-point correlator of one double-trace and two single-trace operators can then be obtained

16

within the ads5/cf t4 correspondence by taking a suitable short distance limit of a 4-
point correlators of single traces.

our calculations involved supergravity elds analogous to the sk of [5], and we chose
to process the derivative interactions in (3.27) by partial integration rather than eliminate
them by eld redenition of the schematic form s = s + s2 + (s)2 as was done in [5].
we have considered the question of a similar transformation of the elds tk and k. for
example, for the lowest harmonics k1 = k2 = k3 = 0, which is an extremal conguration,
the transformation

t0 = t0 +

a(0, 0, 0)

3

d0 d0

0 = 0 +

2a(0, 0, 0)

3

dt0 d0.

(3.48)

takes us directly from (3.27) to an action for t0 and 0 which is free through cubic cou-
plings. the equations of motion are not used in this transformation and no boundary terms
appear. one might be tempted to say that the new elds couple to mixtures of single and
doubletrace operators (as proposed in [21] for sk elds), but we could not demonstrate
this to our satisfaction. it may also be the case that the required transformation of elds
is inadmissable because it is noninvertible or not compatible with the boundary value
problem used in the ads/cf t correspondence. frankly, we are still confused about the
role of the sk elds, and we suggest that it is an interesting issue for future study.

4 nonrenormalization conjectures for extremal n

point functions

although the considerations of this section apply to all extremal npoint functions of chiral
primary operators ok, we discuss the simplest case of 4point functions in detail and then
briey indicate the general line of argument. we consider correlators hok1ok2ok3ok4i,
with k1 = k2 + k3 + k4, as they are computed in the large n limit at strong t hooft
coupling from the ads5/cf t4 correspondence. we shall now argue that:

i) the structure of the type iib supergravity action requires that the spacetime form

of these correlators is a product of 2point functions, specically

hok1(x)ok2(y)ok3(z)ok4(w)i =

a

(x  y)2k2(x  z)2k3(x  w)2k4

(4.1)

where the numerical constant a depends on the scale parameters ki. this is the same
functional form as in the freeeld approximation.

ii) compatibility of this factored form with operator product expansions requires that

the constant a is not renormalized.

17

thus for large n, the extremal 4point functions take the same value at large t hooft
coupling  = g2
y m n as in the freeeld approximation. it is natural to conjecture that
the extremal 4point functions of chiral primary operators at large n are independent of
 = g2
y m n . as for 3point functions [5, 16] a stronger version of the conjecture is that
these 4point functions are independent of gy m for any n.

we will take the point of view that the result for the extremal correlator is correctly
given by the procedure of analytic continuation in the conformal dimensions ki. the
result of the previous section makes us condent that this is indeed the case. it should
be possible to recover all of the following analysis by working at exact extremality and
carefully considering the boundarylike interactions studied in the previous section, and
we will make some remarks on how we expect this to happen.

we need to consider two types of contributions to hok1ok2ok3ok4i: exchange diagrams

with two 3point couplings, and a quartic graph with one 4point coupling.

let us begin by examining the exchange diagrams. without loss of generality we can
consider the case where sk1(x1) and sk2(x2) join by a cubic vertex to some intermediate
eld , which then joins by a cubic vertex to the other two elds at x3 and x4. each
of the elds ski is in su(4) representation with dynkin label (0, ki, 0). multiplying the
representations of the elds at x1 and x2 and also taking the product of representations
for the other pair, is easy to see that the only common representation between these
two products has dynkin label (0, k3 + k4, 0). this must be the representation of the
intermediate eld , and there are two possibilities: either  is the primary eld sk3+k4 or
it is a su(2, 2|4) descendent. by detailed consultation of the tables in [15] which present
the spectrum of the dimensionally reduced type iib theory and those of [23] on the
structure of the relevant representation of the superalgebra su(2, 2|4), one learns that the
possible descendent states in the same su(4) representation have dimension  > k3 + k4
and they are superconformal descendents of chiral primaries of dimension k > k3 + k4. we
now proceed to discuss in turn the exchange diagrams for primaries and descendents.

(a)

if the exchanged eld  is the chiral primary sk of dimension k = k3 + k4, then
we must consider the cubic couplings g(k1, k2, k)sk1sk2sk and g(k3, k4, k)sk3sk4sk. how-
ever both vertices are extremal and the coupling constants vanish. stated in terms of a
calculation of the exchange diagram by analytic continuation, we nd a double zero in
the numerator. however, each of the two integrals over ads5 produces a pole so the net
amplitude is nite. one way to see this is to generalize the argument used for the contact
graph.
in the rst step one sees that the integral diverges when the adjacent internal
vertex approaches the boundary point ~x1 of the highest dimension operator. the singular
pole factor 1/ of (4.2) multiplies the spacetime product of 1/(~x1  ~x2)2k2 times a further
divergent integral which is exactly the extremal 3-point function of primary operators of
dimension k3, k4 and k3 + k4. the net result for the amplitude is a nite multiple of the

18

factorized form of (4.3). one can also see that the same result is obtained from the scalar
exchange integral computed in sec. 3c of [24] which has a double pole for the relevant
values of scale dimensions of external and exchanged elds.

(b) the treatment of descendent exchange graphs is more complicated. first note
[15] that the descendents in question are scalars and symmetric tensor elds in the su-
pergravity theory, so higher spin exchange diagrams which have not yet been studied in
general form are involved. the coupling constants for the cubic vertices sk1sk2 and sk3sk4
are related by supersymmetry to the primary vertices1 in the previous paragraph except
that now we have k > k3 + k4. the coupling g(k3, k4, k) vanishes (by su(4) avor sym-
metry), but g(k1, k2, k) does not vanish. thus only one of the two descendent couplings
vanishes. consider the case of an exchanged scalar descendent eld. it can be seen from
examination of sec 3c of [24] that the exchange integral has a single pole for relevant values
of the dimensions, and that the singular factor multiplies exactly the spacetime function
we need. the divergence in this case comes when both interaction vertices are within a
small region near the boundary point ~x1 of the highest dimension operator. the singular
contribution does not depend on the spin of the exchanged eld, since the short distance
behavior of the bulktobulk propagator is universal. thus we believe that both descen-
dent scalar and tensor exchange graphs contribute nite multiples ofthe desired factored
space-time form (4.3).

next, we analyse the quartic graph, which (after an appropriate eld redenition) is

obtained from a 4point vertex of the form

zads5 g(k1, k2, k3, k4)sk1sk2sk3sk4 .

the coecient g(k1, k2, k3, k4) of this vertex in the supergravity action is not yet known,
although it is certainly possible to obtain it by extending the analysis of [5].

we now observe that the integral over the ads5 space involved in the extremal quartic
graph diverges. the divergence comes from the region where the integration variable
approaches the location of the operator of higher dimension ok1 on the boundary. to see
(z~x1)2 )k1, while
this divergence, note that near this point the propagator kk1 behaves as (
each of the other propagators behaves as (z0)ki, i = 2, 3, 4. the integration measure is d5z
.
z5
thus we see that the integral is logarithmically divergent at z  ~x1.

assembling the results for the quartic term with those of the exchange diagrams, for
the case of extremal correlators, we conclude the following. since the exchange diagrams
yield nite contributions, and the ads integral for the quartic diagram diverges, a nite
result for the 4point function requires that the quartic coupling vanishes at extremality.

z0

0

1recently, all the cubic couplings between two s elds and any other supergravity eld have been

explicitly determined [21, 22].

19

all of the following considerations are subject to this plausible (and in principle checkable)
assumption.

to regulate the divergent integral, and nd the value of the extremal 4point function,
consider the following procedure of analytic continuation. let the elds ski, for i = 2, 3, 4,
have dimension ki + , while we keep the dimension of sk1 to be k1. the integral is then
nite, though it is still dominated by the region in the innitesimal vicinity of z  ~x1.
thus the propagators kki, for i = 2, 3, 4, be approximated by the form

the integral thus gives

(4.2)

in line with our assumption that the coupling is zero at exact extremalty, and in analogy
with the 3point case, it is plausible that if we analytically continue the dimensions as
above the coupling g(k1, k2 + , k3 + , k4 + )  . then the quartic graph gives
(~xi  ~x1)2 ki  hok2(~x2)ok2(~x1)ihok3(~x3)ok3(~x1)ihok4(~x4)ok4(~x1)i

 yi=2,3,4

 

(4.3)

which is exactly the factorized form of (4.1).

instead of the analytic continuation procedure just outlined, it should be possible
to carry out a careful analysis at exact extremality. the bulk coupling g(k1, k2, k3, k4)
vanishes at extremality, but we expect that in the dimensional reduction a boundary
interaction of the form r(ads5) dnsk1dnsk2dnsk3dnsk4 is induced through the constraints.

it is easy to check (for example by the momentum space analysis of the previous section)
that such an interaction reproduces the factorized functional form (4.3). (note that as
in the case of 3point functions, this boundary term gives a contribution only at exact
extremality, k1 = k2 + k3 + k4).

we conclude that the large n, strong t hooft coupling limit of the extremal 4point
functions of chiral primary operators, computed in supergravity, takes the factorized form
of a product of three 2point functions, as in (4.3). this is the same functional form as in
the free eld theory approximation, and it thus suggests that extremal 4point functions
are not renormalized; that is they are independent of  = g2
y m n, at least for large n!
assuming the factorized form it is quite remarkable that one can prove non-renormalization
by an operator product argument similar to the argument at the beginning of section 2.
the argument applies to the general extremal correlator hok1ok2ok3ok4i, but to simplify

20

the notation we consider the particular case k1 = 6, k2 = k3 = k4 = 2 which we assume
has the form

ho6(x)o2(y)o2(z)o2(w)i =

a

(x  y)4(x  z)4(x  w)4 .

we will show that a is not renormalized, if the 2 and 3point functions that appear in
the argument below are not renormalized.

consider the operator product expansion o6(x)o2(y) which contains
+ . . .

where . . . indicates the contribution of operators in representations of su(4) dierent
from the common representation (0, 4, 0) in the o6o2 and o2o2 direct products, and also
operators in the (0, 4, 0) representation belonging to long multiplets.

the assumed factorized form of the 4point function (4.4) requires that the only com-
mon operators in the o6o2 and o2o2 op es are of dimension 4 (and their derivative
descendents which are omitted for simplicity). this rules out a possible contribution to
the double ope from nonprotected longmultiplet operators.

we also need the forms of several 2- and 3-point functions, namely

ments of [5, 16, 11], and the argument of sec 2 shows that a4(22) = c422. using the ope
(4.5) in the 3-point functions (4.10) and (4.11) one nds the relations

c
624a44 + c

62(22)a4(22) = c624,
62(22)a(22)(22) = c62(22).

624a4(22) + c
c

(4.12)

(4.13)

which imply that the ope coecients c

624 and c

62(22) are not renormalized.

the nal step is to take the limit y  x of the 4point function (4.4) and use (4.9) to

obtain

a = c

624c422 + c

62(22)c22(22),

(4.14)

21

which shows that a is not renormalized.

these considerations naturally extend to higher point functions. for extremal n
point functions of chiral primaries, all disconnected diagrams necessarily vanish, since
they factorize into several connected graphs each of which cannot be an su(4) singlet.
using arguments similar to the 4point function case, one nds that connected diagrams
yield, after the analytic continuation procedure, a factorized product of (n  1) twopoint
functions. therefore, we are led to the same nonrenormalization conjectures for the
extremal npoint functions of chiral primaries for any n.

5 appendix

in this appendix we present arguments that the extremal 3-point functions, evaluated
directly from the bulk version of the type iib supergravity action of (3.27), are uniquely
dened and nite. this method of evaluating the extremal 3-point functions is equivalent
to that starting from the pure surface action of (3.36), but it circumvents subtle divergences
encountered at intermediate stages when dealing directly with the surface action (3.36).

to exhibit these subtle divergences, we start from the surface action (3.36), which is
all that remains at extremality. in evaluating the 3-point functions, we encounter contri-
butions of the type

zads

z0k(z0, x; x1)z0k(z0, x; x2)z0k(z0, x; x3)d4x .

(5.15)

the 4-dimensional x integral above has singularities at x = xi, i = 1, 2, 3. it is not imme-
diately clear how these singularities should be regulated. if the total 3-point function is
to be nite, we should probably expect to nd dirac -function contributions localized at
the points xi which can compensate for the divergences at x = xi. clearly, the regulariza-
tion of both the surface integral and the -functions will be subtle and must be handled
with great care. in particular, the presence of the -functions will require us to work with
smeared out sources.

what we show below is that the bulk integral (3.27) that we start with is itself well
dened. we do this by showing that there is no divergence in such an integral from the
vicinity of the points xi, the rest of the integral is easily seen to be convergent. having
proved this convergence we see that we can truncate the domain of integration of the bulk
point z slightly above the boundary. the boundary is at z0 = , and so the bulk integral
will be restricted to z0 >  + , with the limit   0 being taken before the limit   0.
since the bulk integral is convergent, the contribution to the integral from the region
 < z  0 <  +  is ignorable, but this regularisation allows a sensible and well dened
integration by parts. the integration variable x on the boundary is now at z0 =  + ,
and so does not collide with the source insertions at xi which are at a value z0 = . as

22

mentioned in section 3, the result computed for extremal correlators in this manner agrees
with the analytic continuation of the 3-point function in dimensions from the case where
the correlator is not extremal.

to see the regularity of the bulk integrals, consider the integrals cubic in the elds in
(3.27). it is not hard to check that the rst of these integrals is convergent, so we will
make some remaks about the second integral, which help towards showing that this latter
integral is convergent too. the most signicant divergence comes from the integral in the
vicinity of the point x1, so we work in a ball around x1, with x2 and x3 assumed to be far
away.

(1) we start with a regularisation where we have taken the boundary of our space to
be at z0 =  rather than at z0 = 0. as noted in section 3, at short distances (less than the
ads curvature length scale) we must use the boundary to bulk propagator appropriate to
at space, as given in (3.42). now we note that to derive the 3-point function, we must
take a functional derivative with respect to the boundary values of the elds. to avoid
singularities associated with a delta function source, we start with a source that is smeared
in a region around the insertion points; since we are concerned with the vicinity of x1 we
just smear the source at this point and do not concern ourselves with the other sources.
let the smeared eld have a prole f (x), with

z f (x)dx = 1 .

(5.16)

it is important that as we shrink the size of the smearing region the result of the integral
should cease to depend on the size and shape of the smearing region, and should be
sensitive only to the total integral of f given in the above equation.

(2) there are four derivatives in the term of interest. the directions of dierentia-
tion are summed indices, and so these derivatives can be in the z0 direction or in the zi
directions. the strongest potential divergences arise from the case where the derivatives
are in the z0 direction. the reason is that the term 2 is given by

2(z0, x) = k(z0, x; x2)

(5.17)

and k is constructed to be a dirichlet boundary to bulk propagator. thus for x 6= x2

and a more careful analysis will give

lim
z0

k(z0, x, x2) = 0

2(z0, x)  xi2(z0, x)  (z0  )

(5.18)

(5.19)

for z0  . the above fact improves the convergence of the terms that involve derivatives
in the directions zi, and so we will concentrate below on the case where all derivatives are
in the direction z0.

23

(3) the term tk1 in eq. (3.29) is

tk1(z0, x) = z dy k(z0, x; y)f (y)

(5.20)

where we will assume that since we are looking at short distances k has the form of the at
space kernel given above. x, y are 4-dimensional variables, and f is the smearing function
introduced above. for z0  , we may expand

z dy kf (z0, x; y)f (y)

= z dy kf (z0, x; y)[f (x) + (y  x)if,i(x) + (y  x)i(y  x)jf,ij(x) + . . .]

this equals

f (x) + (z0  )2f,i

i(x) + . . .

(5.21)

(5.22)

where ,  are of order unity, and the term of order z0   vanishes by the rotational
symmetry of kf . (this vanishing will be important in what follows.)

thus when we compute z0 derivatives of r kf we get

z0 z kf (z0, x; y)f (y)dy = (z0  )f,i

i(x)  0 for z0  

(4)

let us dene

h(z0, x)  z0k2(z0, x)z0k3(z0, x)

(5.23)

(5.24)

as mentioned above, h is a smooth bounded function in the region near x1 that we are
studying. now the integral we are studying has the form

z h(z0, x)2

z0k(z0, x; y)f (y)dz0dxdy

and we are considering the integral in a box in 5-d space, enclosing the point x1 of the
boundary but not enclosing x2, x3. let us integrate once by parts. then we get

z

h(, x) lim
z0

z0kf (z0, x; y)f (y)dxdy z z0h(z0, x)z0kf (z0, x; y)f (y)dz0dxdy (5.25)

the rst term vanishes by what we found above. the second term we integrate by parts
again to get

z

this is

z0h(z0, x) lim
z0

kf (z0, x; y)f (y)dxdy +z 2

z0h(z0, x)kf (z0, x; y)f (y)dz0dxdy (5.26)

z

z0h(z0, x)f (x)dx +z 2

z0h(z0, x)kf (z0, x; y)f (y)dz0dxdy

(5.27)

24

note that the smeared function must satisfy r f (x)dx = 1. since h is smooth, we may

approximate the rst term in the above equation to get

 z0h(z0, x1) +z 2

z0h(z0, x)kf (z0, x; y)f (y)dz0dxdy

(5.28)

the bulk integral in the above is now no more singular than the two-derivative term in
the initial action(3.29).

note that we have not used any moments of the smearing function apart from its
zeroth moment; this is important because as mentioned above if there was any additional
dependence on f then the functional derivative was ill dened, and the result would have
to be called regulation dependent.

(5)

by what was said at the start of this appendix, we thus understand how to
regulate the boundary terms that arise in any integrations by parts in the calculation of
the extremal correlator. instead of explicitly smearing the source function, we can imagine
using a momentum basis to expand functions in a region around x1: this region would
have to be much larger than the ads length scale r for the fourier transform to make
sense, but can be taken to be much smaller than the distance to the other insertions at
x2, x3. this enables a simple calculation, while avoiding any contact terms that can arise
when x1 approaches x2, x3. the result of this calculation was presented in section 3.
