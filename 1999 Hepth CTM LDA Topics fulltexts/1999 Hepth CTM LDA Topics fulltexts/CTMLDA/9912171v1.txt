noncommutative geometry and quantization

we examine some recent developments in noncommutative geometry, including spin geo-
metries on noncommutative tori and their quantization by the shalestinespring pro-
cedure, as well as the emergence of hopf algebras as a tool linking index theory and
renormalization calculations.

introduction

the purpose of these lectures is to survey several aspects of noncommutative geo-
metry, with emphasis on its applicability to particle physics and quantum eld
theory. by now, it is a commonplace statement that spacetime at short length
or high energy scales is not the cartesian continuum of macroscopic expe-
rience, and that older methods of working with functions on manifolds must be
rethought in order to handle granular or bubbly spacetime and the matter elds
which they support. the question as to what should replace the continuum is an
ongoing one. noncommutative geometry (ncg) oers a general approach to the
job of describing the geometrical aspects of nonclassical spaces. the hope is that
it can provide a solid framework for studying fundamental interactions and qft.
here we consider four aspects of this general problem. in section 1, we dis-
cuss the noncommutative tori that have recently emerged as an important model
is string theory.13 section 2 reviews the general structure of noncommutative
geometries based on the spectral triples of connes.4 the third section broaches
the formulation of quantum eld theories over noncommutative spaces, using the
example of a 3-torus.5,6 in section 4, we sketch how hopf algebras provide a link
between ncg and renormalization calculations,710 that illuminates the claim that
qft is the geometry of the world.

1. noncommutative tori

the spaces and tools of ncg can be approached from two dierent points of
view: either as theoretical constructs that form part of a principled explanatory
scheme, or as objects that are fortuitously found in nature and therefore point
to an (as yet incomplete) underlying theory. a striking example of the second
viewpoint is the emergence of noncommutative tori from compactication of matrix
models.1

noncommutative geometry and quantization 2

in those models, one considers an action functional of the general form

i =x,

tr f 2

 + 2xi,j,

tr i

ij [, j],

where  is a connection and f is its curvature. for instance, we may ask that  =
x be matrix components of some lie algebra representation, f = [x, x], the
 being gamma-matrices, and the i are odd variables. in the example considered
in ref. 1, the matrices (x, i) are labelled by coordinates of the superspace c10|16.
to compactify, we ask that at least some of the x variables change only by
a gauge transformation under certain xed translations x 7 x + r. for two
such directions, this gives

x0 + r0 = u0x0u1
0 ,
x1 + r1 = u1x1u1
1 ,
x = uxu1

i = uiu1


in all other cases,

in all cases,

for certain unitary operators u (to be determined). by taking traces of the rst
two equations, it becomes clear that these equations have no solutions in n  n
matrices. however, there are formal operator solutions, such as

x0 = ir0


0

+ a0(0, 1),

x1 = ir1


1

+ a1(0, 1),

and x = a(0, 1) for other , where 0, 1 are angular variables and u0, u1 are
rotations of these angles.

1 u1

to get a clearer picture, notice that all x and i commute with the unitary
u1u0u1
0 . if we are looking for an irreducible solution of the equations, we can
suppose that this unitary is a scalar. thus there is some number  = e2i of
absolute value 1, such that

u1u0 = e2iu0u1.

(1)

now, the point is that nothing we have said so far demands that  be equal to 1
(that is,  = 0), so we can perfectly well suppose that it is not. indeed, if  = 0,
then u0 and u1 can be taken as coordinate rotations on the ordinary torus t2. for
any other (non-integer) value of , u0 and u1 become coordinates for a certain
noncommutative space, namely, the nc torus t2
.

when compactifying in more than two dimensions, we obtain more relations,

of the form

ukuj = e2ijk ujuk,

(2)

where  = [jk] is now a real skewsymmetric matrix.

noncommutative geometry and quantization 3

1.1. the nc torus as a noncommutative space

the last statement is to be interpreted as follows. noncommutative topology
replaces a locally compact space of points y by its algebra c0(y ) of continuous
functions vanishing at innity; this is a commutative c -algebra. no information
is lost (or gained) in passing from the space to the algebra, and the process is
reversible: this is the content of the gelfandnamark theorem.11 for instance,
the space is compact if and only the algebra has a unit element, the space is
disconnected if and only if the algebra contains nontrivial idempotents, and so
on. to deal with gauge potentials and suchlike, it is often better to work instead
with the dense subalgebra of smooth functions. finally, we abandon points by
discarding the commutativity property and by calling any c -algebra a noncom-
mutative space; or, if smoothness remains important, we work with certain dense
subalgebras called pre-c -algebras.

from this point of view, the nc torus t2

 is just a certain dense subalgebra of
the c -algebra generated by two unitaries subject only to the relation (1). notice
that this is not the notorious quantum plane, since the requirement of unitarity
is met by four more relations: u0u
1u1 = 1, which are not
asked of the quantum plane.

0u0 = 1, u1u

1 = u

0 = u

the n-dimensional noncommutative tori are to be regarded as quantizations of
the ordinary torus, whose algebra is c (tn) =: tn
0 . indeed, noncommutativity
is achieved by replacing the ordinary product of functions on tn with the moyal
product: see, for instance, ref. 12 or our ref. 13. a quick-and-dirty way to do
this is by describing elements of tn

 as noncommutative fourier series.

for deniteness, we take n = 3 and let  be a real skewsymmetric 3 3 matrix.
the 3-torus is generated by three unitaries u1, u2, u3, subject to the commutation
relations (2) and no others. introduce the unitary weyl elements5,14

ur := exp{i(r112r2 + r113r3 + r223r3)} ur1

1 ur2

2 ur3
3 ,

for each r  z3; the coecient is chosen so that (ur) = ur in all cases. they
obey the product rule

ur us = (r, s) ur+s,

(r, s) := exp{ipj,k rjjksk}.

(3)

notice that |(r, s)| = 1 and (r,r) = 1 by skewsymmetry of . this  is in fact
a 2-cocycle for the abelian group z3 and the c -algebra c (z3, ) is generated by
the ur subject to this product rule is called a twisted group c -algebra. the nc
torus t3

 is the dense subalgebra consisting of all fourier series

t3

 := { a =pr ar ur : ar  0 rapidly},

where rapid decrease of the coecients means that (1+|r|2)k |ar|2 is bounded for all
0  c (t3).
k = 1, 2, 3, . . .. in the commutative case  = 0, this condition gives t3

noncommutative geometry and quantization 4

this algebra is naturally represented on a certain hilbert space, using an old
trick (the gns construction) that requires a faithful state on the algebra. in fact,
there is one such state which is also a trace:

by completing t3

 in the hilbert norm

 (pr arur) := a0.

kak2 :=p (aa) = (pr |ar|2)1/2,
we get a hilbert space h . we write c for an element c  t3
in h . then the gns representation of t3

 is just

 regarded as a vector

(a) : c 7 ac.

in other words, t3

the lie group t3 acts by rotations on the algebra t3

 acts on h by left multiplication operators.
1 zr2

, as follows: for each r,
3 ur. the trace  is invariant under this action; indeed, 

(z1, z2, z3)  ur := zr1
picks out the only rotation-invariant component of an element of t3
.

2 zr3

there is a special antiunitary operator j0 on h , given by

j0(a) := a.

this is the tomita conjugation15 determined by the cyclic and separating vector 1
for the representation ; clearly, j 2

0 = 1. the operator

(b) := j0(b)j0 : c 7 j0bc = cb

is a right multiplication by the element b, and is an antirepresentation of t3
.
equivalently,  is a true representation of the opposite algebra of t3
, obtained
by reversing the product. a glance at (2) shows that this opposite algebra is t3
.
life is simpler if we forget to write the s; the commutativity of left and right
multiplications is then expressed as

[a, j0bj0] = 0 for all a, b.

(4)

dierential calculus on tori begins with the partial derivatives

j(pr arur) := 2ipr rj arur

(j = 1, 2, 3).

to see why they are partial derivatives, pretend that  = 0, so that the ur =
exp{2i(r11 + r22 + r33)} are a basis for an (ordinary) fourier expansion on t3.
as operators on the algebra, the j are symmetric derivations:

j(ab) = (ja)b + a(jb),

j(a) = (ja),

and they satisfy  (ja) = 0.

noncommutative geometry and quantization 5

with the canonical trace  and the partial derivatives, we build up certain

rotation-invariant multilinear forms on t3

. besides  itself, we nd

j(a, b)

:=  (a jb),

jk(a, b, c)

(a, b, c, d)

:=

1
 (a jb kc  a kb jc)
2i
1
42 ijk  (a ib jc kd).
:= 

when  = 0, these forms correspond to the homological structure of the ordinary
3-torus: think of the vertex, the edges, the faces and the interior of a periodic box
in 3-space. for instance, j(a, b) is matched with the line integral of the 1-form
a db over the jth edge of the box. a deep theorem of connes16 relates the de rham
homology of a (commutative) manifold m to the cyclic cohomology of the algebra
c (m): after factoring out certain redundancies, the resulting periodic cyclic
cohomology of c (m) is isomorphic to the de rham homology of m. it turns
out that  , j, jk and  are cyclic cocycles, of respective degrees 0, 1, 2 and 3,
for the torus t3

, independently of .

there is also an algebraic counterpart of de rham cohomology. there is a
theory of cyclic homology of algebras,17 but we only need the (less complicated)
hochschild homology, and only in the top degree. the chains for this homology
theory are multiple tensor products of algebra elements. here, for example, is the
algebraic counterpart of the volume form on a 3-torus:

1

c :=

6(2i)3 ijku1

i u1

j u1

k  uk  uj  ui.

the boundary operator b collapses one tensor product to a multiplication, yielding
the following alternating sum:

b(t  u  v  w) = tu  v  w  t  uv  w + t  u  vw  wt  u  v,
and an easy calculation5 shows that b c = 0, so that c is a hochschild 3-cycle.

1.2. spin geometry on the nc torus

geometry now enters the picture through the dirac operator

d = i 

where the (euclidean) gamma matrices satisfy  +  = 2 . when n = 2m
or 2m + 1, these act on a vector space of dimension 2m. the spinor space is then

h := h  h      h

(2m times).

in the cases n = 2 or 3, there are two copies of h and the gamma matrices are
just the standard pauli matrices. for n = 3,

d := i(1 1 + 2 2 + 3 3) = i(cid:18) 3

1 + i2

1  i2

3 (cid:19) .

(5)

noncommutative geometry and quantization 6

for the case n = 2, there is no 3 and the diagonal entries are replaced by zeros,
so d is an odd matrix. indeed, the grading operator 3 := i 12 anticommutes
with d when n = 2. for n = 3, there is no grading available. when  = 0, we
recover the well known dirac operators on tori (with the standard at metric and
untwisted spin structure).

the riemannian distance on the ordinary torus tn is determined by the dirac

operator, through the formula18

d(p, q) = sup{ |a(p)  a(q)| : a  c(tn), k[d, a]k  1 }.

see ref. 13 or section vi.1 of ref. 19 for a proof of that; the formula works
because k[d, a]k is the sup norm of the gradient of a. the formula also makes
sense, as a denition, for noncommutative tori, with c(t n) replaced by the c -
algebra completion of tn
 and p, q interpreted as pure states of this c -algebra.
unfortunately, that is of little use since the state space is quite complicated. the
issues of using the distance formula for noncommutative algebras are thoroughly
discussed by rieel in ref. 20.

the charge conjugation operator on h is given by
c := i2  j0 =(cid:18) 0 j0
0 (cid:19) ,

j0

for n = 2 or 3. for higher n, the rst factor in c is a suitable product of gamma
matrices that makes c antiunitary and satises cc 1 = .
in general,
c 2 = 1, with a dimension-dependent sign. in the commutative case, the factor
j0 reduces to complex conjugation of functions.
by combining several of these ingredients, we can represent hochschild chains
on the spinor spaces. an r-chain with values in tn
 is a sum of terms of the
form (a  b)  a1      ar where b = (b) lies in the opposite algebra; such a
term is represented by the operator

  tn

d((a  b)  a1      an) := acbc 1 [d, a1] . . . [d, an].

when b = 1, we omit it. for example, if n = 3, we see that [d, uj] = 2 j, so the
volume form is represented by

d(c) =

(2)3
6(2i)3 ijk kji =

(2)3
6(2i)3 (6i) = 1.

when n = 4, the analogous calculation gives d(c) = 5, from the product of four
gamma matrices. in general, the volume form is represented by 1 or by the grading
operator, according as n is odd or even.

the dimension may also be extracted from the dirac operator, by examining
the growth of its spectrum. ignoring zero modes (of which there are only a nite
number), we nd that d1 is a compact selfadjoint operator, so that both d and

noncommutative geometry and quantization 7

|d| := dd have discrete spectra. if sk(d) denotes the kth singular value of d
(i.e., the kth eigenvalue of |d|) in increasing order, there is one and only one
integer n for which

which is zero for s > 3, diverges for s < 3 and equals 1/32 for s = 3; so indeed
the classical dimension is 3, as expected.

the geometrical apparatus outlined here (dirac operator, spinor space, cyclic
cocycles, volume form, charge conjugation, dimension) of course works the same in
the commutative case; to be precise, this is the geometry of compact spin manifolds.
in refs. 13 and 21, the example of the riemann sphere is done in full detail, and
the general theory is laid out in part iii of ref. 13. in other words, the classical
geometry of riemannian spin manifolds can be rewritten in a purely operatorial
language; but in that new language, many other geometries also appear, that may
be called spin geometries over noncommutative spaces.

2. rules and procedures for nc geometries

we now explain more systematically how the various pieces of the geometrical
apparatus t together. we also need to see how it can serve as the basis for other
models of physical interest. one of the most striking of these was a phenomeno-
logical yangmillshiggs model put forward by connes and lott,19,22,23 in order
to incorporate symmetry breaking at the geometrical level,24 and later developed
by several others.2534 a detailed review of this approach to the standard model
is given in our ref. 33.

noncommutative geometry and quantization 8

2.1. the ground rules for spin geometries

we dene a noncommutative spin geometry by a list of terms and conditions.
the terms form a package g = (a,h, d, c, ), where (a,h, d) is a spectral
triple.35 this means that a is an algebra, represented as operators on a hilbert
space h, and that d is an (unbounded) selfadjoint operator on h such that ker d
is nite-dimensional and d1 is compact on h  ker d, and also that [d, a] is
bounded for each a  a. the operator c is an antiunitary conjugation on h such
that b 7 cbc 1 is a representation of the opposite algebra a which commutes
with a, that is, [a, cbc 1] = 0 for all a, b  a. finally, for  there are two cases:
in the odd case  = 1, and in the even case  is a grading operator, that is, a
selfadjoint operator such that 2 = 1. in the even case, the algebra acts evenly,
a = a, while the operator d is odd, d = d.

there are seven conditions to satisfy,4 which we now list.

we set n = 0.

1. classical dimension: there is a nonnegative integer n, that is odd or even

according as  = 1 or not, such that pkn sk(d)n  c log n as n  ,
with 0 < c < . we writer |d|n := c. if a and h are nite-dimensional,
2. regularity: the bounded operators a and [d, a], for any a  a, belong to the
domain of smoothness t
3. finiteness: the space of smooth vectors h := t
projective left module over the pre-c -algebra a.
inner product ( | ) implicitly dened byr ( | ) |d|n = h | i.
4. reality: the conjugation c satises c 2 = 1, cd = dc, and c = c

k=1 dom(k) of the derivation (t ) := [|d|, t ].

k=1 dom(dk) is a nite
it carries an a-valued

in the even case, where the signs are given by the following tables:

5. first order : [[d, a], cbc 1] = 0 for all a, b  a.
6. orientation: there is a hochschild n-cycle c  (a  a)  an, b c = 0,

whose representative on h satises d(c) = .

7. poincare duality: the fredholm index of the operator d yields a nondegen-

erate intersection form on the k-theory of the algebra a.

we refer to ref. 4 and section 10.5 of ref. 13 for a full discussion of these

conditions and their implications. here we just make a few remarks.

noncommutative geometry and quantization 9

to produce a compact nc space, we demand that a have a unit 1 (think of
the constant function 1 on a manifold), and that d1 be compact outside ker d.
this may be weakened in the locally compact (i.e., nonunital) case by asking
instead that (1 + d2)1/2 be compact. we no longer need to suppose that d is
any sort of dirac operator.

the dimension condition is obtained from a version of weyls formula linking
the dimension and volume of a compact manifold to the growth of the eigenvalues
of the laplacian. for spin manifolds, the lichnerowicz formula d2 =  + 1
4s says
that d2 is a generalized laplacian on spinors.

the regularity condition, in the commutative case, expresses the smoothness of
the coordinate functions a; this can be seen by working out the symbols of k([d, a])
with pseudodierential calculus. another method, developed by rennie,36 also
gives the smoothness of the functions. for the nc tori, the regularity condition
imposes the fast decrease of the fourier series coecients.

the niteness condition asks that the space h of smooth vectors be either
an , a direct sum of several copies of a (so operators and vectors have the same
smoothness properties), or at least of the form pan for some projector p  mn (a).
 , we took h = an where n = 2m when
for the nc tori example with a = tn
n = 2m or 2m + 1. in the commutative case, h is the space of smooth sections
of the spinor bundle.
the tables for the reality condition signal an underlying action of the real
cliord algebra of rn, complete with mod-8 periodicity, that indeed gives rise to
the charge conjugation operator c: for the full story, see chapter 9 of ref. 13. in
short, the sign tables arise from the product rules for gamma matrices.

the poincare duality condition is a reinterpretation, in k-theory language, of
the usual pairing of dierential forms of complementary degrees on an oriented
manifold: see section vi.4 of ref. 19.

two geometries g1 and g2 give rise to a product geometry g, with a = a1a2,
h = h1  h2, 1  1 + 1  2 if, say, g1 is even. we take d = d1  1 + 1  d2.
the product conjugation is worked out on a case-by-case basis.37

2.2. finite geometries

let us look at a baby geometry of classical dimension zero, where a is a nite-
dimensional matrix algebra (stable under taking hermitian conjugates), acting on
a nite-dimensional hilbert space h. then d is a matrix, too, with a nite number
of eigenvalues.
this means that any scheme of approximation of a higher-dimensional space by
a set of nite matrix algebras is not a straightforward matter. a popular model is
the so-called fuzzy sphere,38 where the algebra c (s2) is approximated by algebras
m2j+1(c) obtained from the moyal product on the phase space s2. the issue is
how to control the limit j   when the classical dimension jumps from 0 to 2;
it is fair to say that this problem is still open.

noncommutative geometry and quantization 10

it is instructive, even so, to consider the two-point space over the (commu-

tative!) algebra a = c2, with h = c2 also. we use  =(cid:18) 1
operator, so that a must act by diagonal 2  2 matrices. since n = 0, the ta-
bles give c 2 = +1 and c = c, so c must be just complex conjugation. the
selfadjoint odd operator d is of the form

0 1(cid:19) as the grading

0

d =(cid:18) 0 m

m 0 (cid:19) for some m  c.
0 (cid:19), so m is real. we may as well suppose that m > 0.

but d = cdc =(cid:18) 0 m
the distance between the two points (the pure states of a) is found from
[d, a] =(cid:18)

(cid:19) ,

m(a1  a2)

0

(7)

m

0

m(a1  a2)

so that [d, a]2 = m2(a1  a2)2 12, and thus k[d, a]k = m|a1  a2|. the maximum
value of |a1  a2| when k[d, a]k  1 equals 1/m. this already indicates that m is
an inverse distance, so it can be regarded as a mass.
a more elaborate proposal, arising from the conneslott models,22,26,29,33 is
to use a baby geometry to stand for the yukawa terms in the standard model
lagrangian (at the classical level). this can be thought of when combined with
the spacetime geometry as a useful test case of what a realistic nc geometry
would look like.

the hilbert space for the baby yukawa model has a basis labelled by weyl
fermions. the conjugation c exchanges the particle and antiparticle subspaces,
and reduces d to the act on each of these separately. we can again split with ,
according to chirality; on the particle subspace, d then looks like (7), where now
m is a matrix of lepton and quark masses, incorporating the cabibbokobayashi
maskawa mixing.

the algebra of this model is dictated by the gauge symmetry of the standard
model. we would like a matrix algebra whose unitary group is u(1)  su(2) 
su(3), but there is none available. the best we can manage is to use the local
gauge group u(1)  su(2)  u(3), and later eliminate the extra u(1) factor; it
turns out that this can be done by anomaly cancellation.31 the corresponding
algebra is19

a = c  h  m3(c),

where h denotes the quaternions. (had we tried instead to use h m3(c), whose
unitary group is su(2) u(3), we would have obtained a model whose leptons are
not colour singlets.)
the nal step in building the baby yukawa model is the choice of the represen-
tation of a on the hilbert space; this involves a delicate balancing, with dierent
prescriptions for the lepton and quark sectors. for the details of the construction,
see ref. 33.

noncommutative geometry and quantization 11

a complete analysis of the nite spectral triples that satisfy the requirements
for a noncommutative spin geometry is available.39,40 one nds, in essence, that
when poincare duality is taken into account, the baby yukawa model is the simplest
case that satises all the above conditions.

2.3. gauging the spin geometries

gauge potentials are 1-forms that give hermitian operators:

a :=pj aj [d, bj] with a = a.

by 1-forms we mean nite sums of the indicated kind. since a [d, b] c = a [d, bc]
ab [d, c], such 1-forms make up an a-bimodule of operators on h, which we call
1
d. the gauging rule for the operator d is then

d 7 d + a + cac 1.

fermionic action terms are schematically like i() = h | (d + a + cac 1)i.
if we apply to a an inner automorphism a 7 uau, where u is a unitary
element of a, there is a corresponding unitary operator on h given by u :=
ucuc 1. since cuc 1 commutes with a, the operator u implements the same
inner automorphism. moreover, u commutes with c (by design) and with .
the upshot is that the package g = (a,h, d, c, ) is unitarily equivalent to
(a,h, udu 1, c, ), and so may be regarded as the same spin geometry. we now
compute

udu 1 = cuc 1u d ucuc 1 = cuc 1(d + u [d, u])cuc 1

= cuc 1dcuc 1 + u [d, u] = d + cuc 1 [d, cuc 1] + u [d, u]
= d + u [d, u] + cu [d, u]c 1.

what this means is that the gauge potential a := u [d, u] is trivial, in that it
does not alter the geometry.

for a more general selfadjoint a  1

d, the recipe

c =: [d, c] + ac
denes a covariant derivative on a with values in 1
operator ed on h from the leibniz rule

d. we then get a new selfadjoint

ed(b)

:= (b) + b d + bc(1)c 1
= [d, b] + ab + b d + bcac 1
= (d + a + cac 1) b.

the new geometry is generally not unitarily equivalent to the original one, so we
have arrived at a wider notion of gauge equivalence of geometries.

noncommutative geometry and quantization 12

in fact, one can go much further, generalizing the operator :a  1

d by
introducing connections on nitely generated projective (right) a-modules, that
play the role of vector bundles in ncg. given such a module e, a connection is a
linear map :e  e a 1

d that satises a leibniz rule

(sa) = (s)a + s  [d, a].

working with this connection involves changing the hilbert space to e a h a e
and the algebra to b := enda e, namely, the operators on e that commute with
the right action of a. such a relation among algebras is called morita equivalence.
we refer to ref. 21 for more information on that, and to ref. 41 for a full discussion
of connections. the point is that morita equivalence of algebras is directly linked
to gauge equivalence of geometries.

3. qft on a noncommutative space

we now consider, albeit briey, what we can learn about quantum eld theory
by using the technology of noncommutative spaces and geometries. the emergence
of the nc tori in compactied matrix theories shows that, in principle, one should
be prepared to go noncommutative at the outset.
indeed, there has been a
recent revival of interest in the idea of noncommuting spacetime coordinates. do-
plicher, fredenhagen and roberts42 provided strong evidence for a moyal product
structure on the spacetime variables (noncommutative r4). recently, seiberg and
witten, pulling various strands together, have discussed the pervasive presence of
noncommutative tori in string theory (see ref. 3 and references therein).

the rst to follow up the suggestion that noncommuting coordinates might help
to mollify uv divergences was filk,43 who analyzed how the moyal product aected
path-integral divergences; his analysis, based on general topological properties of
the feynman graphs, found no overall improvement in the uv behaviour. our own
approach5 starts with canonical quantization of fermions, treating the gauge eld
as an external classical source; we also found no better overall uv behaviour. by
quantizing the nonlinear theory by the dual way of treating the fermions with fock
space techniques, and the gauge bosons by functional integration, this conclusion
can be shown to be generally valid. other recent investigations6,44 reinforce this
view. the question is why this no-go theorem should hold.

3.1. quantization of nc spaces

we illustrate the project by setting up the free dirac equation on a noncom-

mutative 3-torus. writing pj := i j, we recall from (5) that

so that the solutions of the equations

d = i    =   p,

(it    p)r = 0,

(it +   p)l = 0

noncommutative geometry and quantization 13

represent weyl neutrinos on the spinor space h = h  h . if one wishes, one
can introduce a mass term which couples these neutrinos:

(it    p)r = ml,

or, more compactly,

(cid:18)

0

it    p
1 + p2

it +   p

0

(it +   p)l = mr,
(cid:19)  = m, with  :=(cid:18) r
l(cid:19) .

(8)

write e(p) := (p2
operator on h , and we can introduce two more positive operators,

3 + m2)1/2. this is the positive square root of a positive

2 + p2

(p)  p := e +   p,

(p) := e    p.

their positive square roots, in turn, are given by

p(p) or p(p) :=

1
2 {(e + m)1/2  (e  m)1/2   p}.

the equation (8) then has plane-wave solutions of the form

e,r = eietur(cid:18)p(r) p(r) (cid:19) ,

with r  z3 and   c2, || = 1.
placing positive functions with positive operators.

in brief, the usual dirac equation calculations go through in rt  t3
the phase of the (free) dirac operator is f := d|d|1 = d(d2)1/2. on each
r }, for r = (r1, r2, r3)  z3, we

two-dimensional subspace of h spanned by {+
can express d and f in terms of pauli matrices:

, on re-

r , 

d = 2   r,

|d| = 2 |r|,

f =

.

  r
|r|

(9)

the eigenvalues are then the same as for the ordinary dirac operator on the ordi-
nary torus (with untwisted boundary conditions).

in order to proceed to fock space, we split the one-particle space as h =
h+ h, in positive- and negative-frequency solutions of the free dirac equation.
that is to say, the grading operator for this splitting is the phase operator f . the
space of solutions h should be regarded as a real hilbert space, on which we are free
to impose a complex scalar product. the interpretation of the negative-frequency
solutions as antiparticles may be implemented by taking the scalar product to be

h | if := h+ | +i + h | i.

any one-particle operator a on h can be written in block form:

a+ a(cid:19) .
a =(cid:18) a++ a+

its odd and even parts can be distinguished with the phase operator:

noncommutative geometry and quantization 14

a+ := (cid:18) a++
a := (cid:18) 0

a+

0

0

a(cid:19) = 1
0 (cid:19) = 1

a+

2(a + f af ),

2(a  f af ) = 1

2f [f, a].

choose any orthonormal bases {k} for h+ and {k} for h, and let bk :=
b(k), dk := d(k) denote corresponding annihilation operators, together with the
creation operators b

k. the quantum counterpart of a on fock space is

k, d

a := ba++b + ba+d + da+b + :dad:,

(10)

where ba++b :=pj,k b

khk | a++jibj, ba+d :=pj,k b

j, and so
on; the last term is normal-ordered. this second-quantization rule corresponds
to the innitesimal spin representation on fock space, developed originally by shale
and stinespring.45 it is independent of the orthonormal bases used, but makes sense
only when a+ and a+ are hilbertschmidt or, equivalently, only when [f, a] is
hilbertschmidt. the details of this quantization recipe can be found, for instance,
in refs. 13,46.

khk | a+jid

in 1 + 1 dimensions, this is enough, since we can usually guarantee that [f, a]
lies in the hilbertschmidt class l2 for pertinent operators a; and then a is
implementable on fock space by (10). in other words, normal ordering is sucient
to regularize the theory.

for higher dimensions, we seek to implement gauge transformations on fock
space. instead of seeking out the most general gauge potentials, we only examine
the trivial vector bundles of rank one (that is, e = a), with gauge potentials in
d. if a =pj aj [d, bj], then (since f d = df ), we nd that
1
[f, a] =pj[f, aj] [d, bj] + aj [d, [f, bj]],
and so the issue is to determine when [f, a]  l2 for all a  a.
the triple (a,h, f ) is called a fredholm module over the algebra a. in general,
such an object consists of an algebra a represented on a hilbert space h, together
with a selfadjoint operator f such that f 2 = 1 and [f, a] is compact for each a  a.
when f is the phase of the operator d dening a spectral triple, these properties
are clear, except possibly the compactness of [f, a]. however, a straightforward
spectral-theory calculation47 shows that, when a = a so that [f, a] is selfadjoint,
the operator inequality

 k[d, a]k |d|1  [f, a]  k[d, a]k |d|1

(11)

holds, so that [f, a] is compact since |d|1 is compact and [d, a] is bounded.

in 1 + 1 quantum eld theory, the schwinger term can be written as

(a, b) =

1
8

tr(f [f, a][f, b]),

noncommutative geometry and quantization 15

if a and b represent innitesimal gauge transformations, for which [f, a] and
[f, b] lie in l2. as well as being a 2-cocycle for lie algebra cohomology, it is also
a cyclic 1-cocycle.48 indeed, its coboundary is

b (a, b, c) =

1
8

tr(f [f, ab][f, c]  f [f, a][f, bc] + f [f, ca][f, b]) = 0.

to go beyond the 1 + 1 case, we start by noting that if a  c (m) for m a
spin manifold of dimension n, and if f is the phase of the dirac operator, then
[f, a]  lp for p > n; this can be proved with pseudodierential calculus. here lp
means the schatten p-class; a compact operator a lies in lp ifpk sk(a)p converges
or, equivalently, if |a|p is traceclass. more generally, if [f, aj]  lp for j = 1, . . . , k,
then49

[f, a1][f, a2] . . . [f, ak]  lp/k

f (a0, a1, . . . , an) := 1

so that the following chern character makes sense, provided that each [f, aj] lies
in ln+1:

2 tr(f [f, a0] [f, a1] . . . [f, an]).

(12)
this is an (n + 1)-linear form on a, which is cyclic that is, moving [f, an] to
the position before [f, a0] changes it only by the sign (1)n of the corresponding
cyclic permutation and one can check that its coboundary vanishes: f is a cyclic
n-cocycle. we say that the fredholm module (a,h, f ) has quantum dimension
n if every [f, a] lies in ln+1.
3.2. the quantum dimension of a noncommutative torus

for the nc torus tn

 , the question of uv divergences comes down to this: is it
possible to improve the implementability of gauge transformations by showing that
[f, a]  lp for some p  n and all a  a? to answer this question, we compute
the quantum dimension of a 3-torus.
we examine the eect of [f, a] on the two-dimensional subspace spanned by
r = |r|1(  r)
r , 
{+
r .
on the other hand, if a =ps asus, the left multiplication operator a does not act
block diagonally; instead, using (3), we nd that a
r+s. thus,

r } for some xed r  z3. from (9), we know that f 

[f, a]

r =xs

(s, r)as(cid:16)  (r + s)
|r + s| 

r =ps (s, r)as
|r| (cid:17) 
  r

r+s.

in the special case a = us, the operator [f, us][f, us] is diagonal, so

[f, us][f, us]

r = (r + s, s) (s, r)(cid:16)  (r + s)
|r + s| 
= 2(cid:16)1 

|r + s| |r|(cid:17) 

(r + s)  r

r .

therefore, if p  1,
k[f, us]kp

p = k[f, us][f, us]kp/2
= 2xr6=0n2  2(cid:16)1 +
= 2xr6=0n|r  s|2

and only if p > 3.

we conclude that [f, us]  lp i pr6=0 |r|p converges, i r 
on the other hand, a similar computation5 shows that k[f, a]k4
4 <  for all
; thus [f, a]  l4 in all cases. we conclude that the quantum dimension
a  t3
of t3
 is greater than 2 but not greater than 3, so it equals 3. recalling now the
calculation (6), that shows that the classical dimension is also 3, we see that both
dimensions coincide.

1 2p d converges, if

it is noteworthy that the parameter  enters the above calculation only through
the cocycle (s, r), which gets estimated by its absolute value and ceases to mat-
ter. therefore, the overall uv behaviour is the same for noncommutative as for
commutative tori, and no improvement due to noncommutativity can be obtained.

3.3. the nc index theorem prevents uv improvement

at rst, one might think that the previous no-go theorem could be a par-
ticular feature of canonical quantization, or an accidental property of the tori.
but we may recall that filk43 found the same result by a dierent argument for
noncommutative r4, and that krajewski and wulkenhaar6,40 also found the same
uv divergences for a yangmills eld over the 4-torus, by path-integral methods.
there have been a few claims of uv improvement in some models, but these either
lie outside our framework of spin geometry, or treat zero-dimensional approxima-
tions only.

to see why it must be so, we call upon one of the deepest results in noncom-
mutative geometry, which establishes the relation between the noncommutative
integral dened by a generalized dirac operator d and the chern character of its
phase operator f . this is the hauptsatz of connes, stating that both of these in-
tegrals take the same values on volume forms: see p. 308 of ref. 19. the precise
statement is that, for a geometry of classical dimension n, the following equality
holds:

0] [f, aj

1] . . . [f, aj

n]) =z pj aj

1

2 tr(fpj[f, aj
whenever pj aj
0  aj

0 [d, aj

1] . . . [d, aj

n]|d|n,

(13)

1      aj

n is a hochschild n-cycle over a.

noncommutative geometry and quantization 17

the proof of this theorem is a long story; this is not surprising, because it
includes the atiyahsinger index theorem for the case a = c (m), as is made
plain in ref. 50. it is also a particular case of the local index theorem in ncg
developed by connes and moscovici.51 by interpolating a one-parameter family
of cyclic cocycles between both sides of (13), one can construct a mckeansinger
type of proof: see chapter 10 of our ref. 13.

the right hand side reduces to an ordinary integral in the commutative case.
in fact, for the dirac operator (and untwisted spin structure) on t3, it can be
shown that

z a0 [d, a1][d, a2][d, a2]|d|3 =

i

32 zt3

a0 da1  da2  da3.

this is achieved by connes trace theorem,52 which establishes that the noncom-
mutative integral of a pseudodierential operator is proportional to its wodzicki
residue, which in turn is given by the ordinary integral of a local density. direct
computation of the chern character is more dicult, since f is given by a singular
integral operator, and the trace is, in principle, a highly nonlocal integral of a
suitable kernel. for t3 (or r3), langmann53 obtained

1

2 tr(f [f, a0][f, a1][f, a2][f, a3]) =

i

32 zt3

a0 da1  da2  da3,

which nicely corroborates the index theorem, and indeed suces for toral geome-
tries.

now, if c is the hochschild n-cycle providing the orientation of a given spin
geometry, for which d(c) = , we can plug it into the formula (13). using an
obvious notation, we get

f (c) =z d(c) |d|n =z |d|n = c > 0,

since 2 = 1. if the quantum dimension were less than n, the chern character
f would have to be of the form (2/n) s 
f is the analogous cyclic
(n  2)-cocycle, and s is the periodicity operator that promotes cyclic (n  2)-
cocycles to cyclic n-cocycles; this follows from the periodicity theorem in cyclic
cohomology.19 however, another consequence of the periodicity theorem is that
promoted cyclic cocycles are trivial in hochschild cohomology, which means that
f (c) would vanish. so the hauptsatz guarantees that the quantum dimension is
at least n.

f , where  

on the other hand, the estimate (11) shows that [f, a]  lp whenever |d|1 
lp, which happens for all p > n. thus, the quantum dimension is exactly n, so
it coincides with the classical dimension in all cases. in other words, the no-go
theorem is an inescapable feature of noncommutative geometry.

noncommutative geometry and quantization 18

4. hopf algebras in noncommutative geometry

the local index theorem of connes and moscovici51 expresses the character f
of a fredholm module obtained from a spectral triple (a,h, d) as a complicated
sum of noncommutative integrals (which are local) involving products of opera-
tors of the form [d2, . . . [d2[d, a]] . . .] and a compensating |d|m. these can be
computed, in principle, as residues of certain zeta functions, but the computations
turned out to be very extensive, even for geometries of dimension 1. in seeking to
streamline the calculations, connes and moscovici identied a hopf algebra that
governs the terms appearing in the index formula.8 this hopf algebra, which we
shall briey describe, is commutative but highly noncocommutative:
it is not a
familiar one from the literature on quantum groups.

a short while previously, kreimer7 had found a similar hopf algebra in a seem-
ingly dierent context, namely, the combinatorial structure of the zimmermann
forest formula for renormalizing integrals corresponding to feynman graphs!
it
turns out that both hopf algebras are closely related.9 subsequent work has shown
that these hopf algebra structures point to a new and deep relationship between
ncg and qft.10 we cannot do justice to it here, so we shall merely sketch the
origins of these kreimerconnesmoscovici algebras and show how they are re-
lated.

4.1. an example of dieomorphism-invariant geometry

to deal with gravity in the ncg framework, one seeks to understand the
geometrical features that are invariant under dieomorphisms.4 for instance, landi
and rovelli55 have explored how the eigenvalues of the dirac operator provide the
natural variables for such a theory.

as a rst step, we can consider how to study the invariants of an oriented man-
ifold m under the action of a subgroup  of the dieomorphism group di(m).
the orbit space m/ is the leaf space of a foliation, but could have an unpleasant
topology (think of the kronecker foliation of a 2-torus under rotations at an irra-
tional angle). in ncg, where we use the algebra instead of the space, this problem
is remedied by taking the crossed product a0 := c (m)  as the natural alge-
bra of coordinates. the crossed product is dened as the algebra generated by the
functions in c (m) and a set of unitaries { v :   }, subject to the relations

vhv 

 = h, where h(x) := h(1(x)).

such an algebra is highly noncommutative, and may lack easily constructed
representations; there will often be no -invariant measure that would help to
build a hilbert space ( could be, say, the full dieomorphism group). the way
out of this dilemma is to replace m by the (oriented) frame bundle f  m, and
to nd a -invariant measure on f . to see how this works, consider the one-
dimensional case. as usual, we take m to be compact, so it is just the circle
m = s1 with local coordinate . the frame bundle is a cylinder, with vertical

noncommutative geometry and quantization 19

coordinate y = es, and any     di +(s1) acts on f by

(, s) = ((), s  log ()).

then it is easy to see that each  preserves the measure es ds d on f . (this means
that f can be depicted as the funnel obtained by revolution of the graph of the
logarithm.) we can now use the hilbert space h := l2(f, es ds d).
elements { f u 

the corresponding algebra a := c 

0 (f ),   }, with the product rule

0 (f ) e acts on h and is generated by

.

 : f  c 

)(gu 

(f u 

the horizontal and vertical vector elds

x := es 


,

y := 


s

serve to dene an operator d by solving the equation d|d| = y 2 +x; this is the d
that enters into the local index computation. to compute anything explicitly, we
need to know how x and y interact with the unitary generators u 
. it turns out
that [y, u 
] = 0, but the horizontal vector elds obey a more complicated formula:

x(f u 

gu 

) = (xf ) u 

gu 

 + f u 

x(gu 

) + es ()
()

f u 

y (gu 
).

write 1(f u 
previous formula can now be abbreviated as

) := (es()/())f u 

. this is a derivation of the algebra a. the

x(ab) = x(a) b + a x(b) + 1(a) y (b),

a, b  a.

(14)

it is obvious that [y, x] = x as vector elds on f , and this relation transfers
to their action on a; moreover, [y, 1] = 1. but x is not quite a derivation and
x, y and 1 do not close to a lie algebra acting on a. in fact, if 2 := [x, 1],
we nd that

2(f u 

) = e2s   2

f u 
.

2

in general, if we introduce

n(f u 

) := ens n

n (log ()) f u 
,

then x, y, 1, . . . , n, . . . closes to a lie algebra, with the commutation relations

[y, x] = x,

[x, n] = n+1,

[y, n] = nn,

[m, n] = 0.

we can rewrite (14) and the leibniz rule for y in the language of coproducts:

y = y  1 + 1  y,
x = x  1 + 1  x + 1  y.

noncommutative geometry and quantization 20

the analogous rules for the 1, 2, 3 may be found from these and the commu-
tation rules, bearing in mind that  is a homomorphism of algebras:

1 = 1  1 + 1  1,
2 = 2  1 + 1  2 + 1  1,
3 = 3  1 + 1  3 + 31  2 + 2  1 + 2

1  1.

(15)

we can continue recursively, using n+1 = [x, n]. from (15) it is clear that
the elements n (without x or y ) generate a hopf algebra that is commutative
but by no means cocommutative.

any hopf algebra comes equipped with an antipode s, which is the unique
linear map from the hopf algebra into itself such that both m(s  id) and
m(ids) are equal to the map taking 1 to 1 and all other generators to 0.
(here m denotes the algebra product.) more explicitly, if  :=pj 
j  
j is the
coproduct of a nontrivial generator , then pj s(
j ) = 0. with
the coproduct and product in hand, the antipode can be determined; see refs. 8,13
or ref. 56 for the details. for example,

j =pj 

j)

js(

s(1) = 1, s(2) = 2 + 2

1, s(3) = 3 + 412  23
1.

with these tools, one can continue to compute the index formula in low-

dimensional cases.8

4.2. nested subdivergences and the forest formula

and now for something completely dierent. suppose that we wish to deal
with a multiloop feynman graph with supercially divergent subgraphs, which
we hope to renormalize by subtracting appropriate counterterms. if there are no
overlapping divergences, the subdivergences form a family of subgraphs that are
either nested or disjoint; such a family is called a forest. the counterterms may
be assigned by zimmermanns forest formula,54 which is a sum over all forests in
the given diagram and constitutes a recursive rule for the several levels of nesting.
kreimer7 discovered that zimmermanns procedure is encoded in a hopf algebra,
whose elements are called rooted trees.9

given a diagram with only nested or disjoint subdivergences, the root of the
tree, depicted at the top, represents the full diagram. the leaves of the tree
are subdivergences that include no proper subdivergences, and ascending links
indicate the intermediate nestings. nodes that are linked only through a higher
node represent disjoint subdivergences. here are all the rooted trees with four
nodes:

t43
9999

 

t44



9999



t41






noncommutative geometry and quantization 21

these rooted trees generate a commutative algebra, whose unit 1 corresponds
to the empty tree. the product is denotes by juxtaposition, and the sum is a
formal one (it corresponds to a sum of integrals for several feynman graphs). we
make it a hopf algebra by introducing a coproduct and identifying an antipode.
to get the coproduct, we need to see how the tree may be cut by lopping o
one or more branches from the root part (which we call the trunk ), without ever
cutting a piece already separated from the root. for the rooted tree denoted t42,
here are the allowable cuts:






9999





9999





9999





9999




for each allowable cut c of a rooted tree t , we denote the trunk by rc(t ), and
the product of the pruned branches by pc(t ). the coproduct satises (1) := 11,
and is given on the nontrivial generators by

t := t  1 + 1  t +xc

pc(t )  rc(t ).

the rst two terms may be absorbed in the sum by adding an empty cut whose
trunk is the whole tree, and a full cut that prunes the whole tree. here, for
example, is (t42):

99

99

 1 + 1 

(cid:17) =

(cid:16)  
+     +    


to determine the antipode, note rst that 1 = m(s  id)(1  1) = s(1), and
that m(s  id)(t ) = s(t ) + t +pc s(pc(t )) rc(t ), and thus

 +    +  

+   

99






s(t ) = t xc

s(pc(t )) rc(t ).

this recursive recipe for s turns out to give precisely the forest formula! that is
proved in ref. 56. thus the lore of counterterms may be reduced to understanding
the recipe for the above coproduct of trees.

4.3. how both hopf algebras are related

to nd the relationship between kreimers hopf algebra and that of connes
and moscovici, we must do a little gardening. there is a unique rooted tree with
one node (the solitary root, called t1) and only one with two nodes (call it t2);
there are two rooted trees with three nodes, called t31 (three nodes in a chain) and
t32 (two leaves sprouting from the root), and we have already seen the four rooted
trees with four nodes. there is an easy way to produce new trees from old,9 called
natural growth: for any tree t , let n(t ) be the sum of all the trees formed by

noncommutative geometry and quantization 22

adding one new branch and leaf at each node of t . thus n(t31) = t41 + t42 + t43,
n(t32) = 2t42 + t44, and so on.

introduce 1 := t1, 2 := n(t1) = t2, 3 := n(t2) = t31 + t32, and in general
n+1 := n(n). for example, 4 = t41+3t42+t43+t44. if we compute the coproducts
of these sums of trees, we nd that

1 = 1  1 + 1  1,
2 = 2  1 + 1  2 + 1  1,
3 = 3  1 + 1  3 + 31  2 + 2  1 + 2

1  1,

and so on. these are exactly the same formulas as (15)!

why so? the connection lies in observing that the natural growth operator

satises a leibniz rule:

n(t1t2) = n(t1)t2 + t1n(t2),

since, given two juxtaposed trees t1 and t2, we may hang the extra node on either
one. we may express this by forming the (abelian) lie algebra generated by the
trees and introducing an extra generator x by declaring that [x, t ] := n(t ).
moreover, the number of nodes #t in a tree t gives a z-grading on the algebra of
trees, since #(t1t2) = #t1 + #t2. we can then add another generator y to the
lie algebra by declaring that [y, t ] := (#t ) t . finally, observe that

[[y, x], t ] = [[y, t ], x] + [y, [x, t ]] = (#t ) [t, x] + [y, n(t )]
= (#t ) n(t ) + (#t + 1) n(t ) = n(t ) = [x, t ],

so that the lie algebra closes with [y, x] = x.

we can compute the coproduct (n(t )), too. all we have to do is to grow an
extra leaf on t and then cut the resulting trees in every allowable way. if the new
branch is not cut in this process, then it belongs to either a pruned branch or to the
trunk that remains after a cut has been made on the original tree t ; this amounts
to (n  id)(t ) + (idn)(t ). on the other hand, if the new branch is cut, the
new leaf contributes a solitary node 1 to pc; the new leaf must have been attached
to the trunk rc(t ) at any one of the latters nodes. since (#rc)rc = [y, rc], the
terms wherein the new leaf is cut amount to [1  y, (t )]. in total,
(n(t )) = (n  id)(t ) + (idn)(t ) + [1  y, t ].

thus, since [x, t ] = [(x), (t )] must hold, we get

(x) = x  1 + 1  x + 1  y.

also, it is easy to see that (y ) = y  1 + 1  y .
the conclusion is that, with these extra generators x and y , the hopf subalge-
bra generated by x, y and the various n is isomorphic to the connesmoscovici
algebra.

noncommutative geometry and quantization 23

the moral of the story is that hopf algebras provide a new and useful entry
point for noncommutative geometry into the business of renormalization. the
hope that this will shed new light on qft can already be justied.10,57
