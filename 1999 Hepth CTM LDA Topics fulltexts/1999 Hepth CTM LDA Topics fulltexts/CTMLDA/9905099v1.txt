abstract

we study the near horizon limit of a four dimensional extreme rotating black hole. the

limiting metric is a completely nonsingular vacuum solution, with an enhanced symmetry
group sl(2, r) u (1). we show that many of the properties of this solution are similar to
the ads2s2 geometry arising in the near horizon limit of extreme charged black holes. in
particular, the boundary at innity is a timelike surface. this suggests the possibility of a

dual quantum mechanical description. a ve dimensional generalization is also discussed.

1. introduction

there is growing evidence in support of the conjecture that string theory with asymp-

totically anti de sitter (ads) boundary conditions is completely described by a dual con-

formal eld theory (cft) [1]. one of the features of ads that makes this correspondence

possible is that the (conformal) boundary at innity is a timelike surface. in many applica-

tions, one can imagine the dual cft living on this timelike boundary. for this reason, the

ads/cft correspondence is often called holographic [2]. in contrast, asymptotically at

boundary conditions lead to a boundary at innity consisting of two null surfaces (together

with a point at spatial innity). it is far from clear what form a holographic description
will take in this case1.

we describe below some vacuum spacetimes with asymptotic structure similar to ads.

they are obtained by taking the near horizon geometry of extreme rotating black hole

solutions. in four dimensions, there is a one parameter family of solutions labeled by the

total angular momentum j. these vacuum spacetimes are completely nonsingular, and can

be used to construct classical solutions to all string theories. one simply takes the product

with a ricci at internal space to obtain a ten (or eleven) dimensional solution. since the
curvature is bounded everywhere, and small for large j, the  (or m-theory) corrections
should be small. one advantage over the ads solutions is that there are no background

ramond-ramond elds, so string propagation in these backgrounds is straightforward.

however an obvious disadvantage is that these solutions do not admit covariantly constant

spinors, and hence are not supersymmetric. the eect of quantum corrections remains to

be investigated.

it is tempting to speculate that there is some type of dual cft description of string

theory on spacetimes which asymptotically approach these vacuum solutions. starting

with the four dimensional kerr solution, one obtains a vacuum solution which resembles
ads2  s2. it has a symmetry group sl(2, r) u (1) and a timelike boundary at innity.
since the boundary of ads2 is one dimensional, one expects the dual theory to have a
conformal quantum mechanical description. unfortunately, despite much eort [4,5] the

ads2/cf t1 correspondence is still poorly understood. we will not be able to describe
the dual theory in our case, although we will make some comments in section ve.

since the ads/cft duality is better understood in higher dimensions, it is natural

to ask whether spacetimes analogous to higher dimensional ads arise in the near horizon

1 for a discussion of obtaining this as a limit of the ads/cft correspondence see [3].

1

limits of rotating black holes in higher dimensions. several people have studied the near

horizon geometry of rotating charged black holes and p-branes [6,7,8,9]. however, in all

these cases, the charge plays an essential role, and most solutions are asymptotically ads.

what about higher dimensional analogs of the kerr solution [10]? if the spacetime has

only one component of angular momentum nonzero, then there is no extremal black hole

in more than ve dimensions. a given mass black hole can have arbitrarily large angular

momentum. if all components of the angular momentum are nonzero, then there is an

extremal limit, but we expect the near horizon geometry will still resemble ads2. this
is because the eective cosmological constant in these vacuum solutions can be thought

of as arising from the o diagonal terms in a kaluza-klein reduction of the metric. this

always produces a two form maxwell eld which can act like a cosmological constant in

two dimensions only. to obtain adsn for n > 2 one would need a higher rank form which
does not arise naturally in a vacuum solution.

in the next section we derive the near horizon limit of the extreme kerr solution and

show that it has enhanced symmetry. we also discuss geodesics, and nd that timelike

geodesics with suciently large angular momentum can escape to innity. however, just

like radial null geodesics in ads, they do so in nite coordinate time but innite ane

parameter. this shows that the throat solution is geodesically complete, and has a timelike

boundary.

the possibility of viewing the vicinity of the extreme kerr horizon as a complete

vacuum spacetime in its own right was suggested by the results of bardeen and wagoner

[11] (see also [12]). they studied the exterior metric of a uniformly rotating disk in the

extreme relativistic limit. if the relativistic limit (innite redshift from the center of the

disk) is taken before taking the limit of innite ane distance from the disk, the asymptotic

geometry is the throat of an extreme kerr black hole rather than an asymptotically at

spacetime.

in section three, we discuss propagation of a massless scalar test eld in this back-

ground. most modes have discrete frequencies and are conned. however, a few modes

with large azimuthal angular momentum can propagate to innity. we will argue that

this can lead to an analog of superradiance where a wave can scatter and return with

more energy than it started with. when backreaction is included, the throat solution

is denitely unstable. we give a general argument (independent of superradiance) that
nearby solutions will be singular. this argument also shows that ads2  s2 is unstable,

2

but not higher dimensional ads spacetimes. in [5] another argument for the instability of
ads2  s2 is given, and it is suggested that the dual theory may describe only ground
states of string theory, and not nite energy excitations. the same may be true in our

case as well. alternatively, the instability may simply indicate that the addition of any

amount of energy produces a black hole. the dual theory could perhaps describe these

black states as well.

our results can be extended to the general kerr newman solution describing a charged

rotating black hole. the near horizon limit of this solution is briey discussed in section

four. in the following section we make some comments about the dual quantum mechanical

theory. perhaps the key observation is that the area of the event horizon is related to the

eective cosmological constant of ads2 in a universal way that is independent of whether
the extreme black hole has only angular momentum, charge or both. this suggests that

the quantum mechanical theories which are dual to these backgrounds are closely related.

finally, in section six, we discuss the near horizon limit of the ve dimensional extreme

kerr solution. the resulting geometry is more complicated, but qualitatively similar to
the four dimensional case. the limiting solution resembles ads2  s3.

2. kerr throat solution and its properties

we begin with the (four dimensional) kerr metric in boyer-linquist coordinates:

ds2 = e2 dt2 + e2(d   dt)2 + 2(1dr2 + d2)

2  r2 + a2 cos2 ,

  r2  2m r + a2

where

and

e2 =

,

e2 =  sin2  e2 ,

 =

2m ra
2 e2

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

the total mass is m , and the angular momentum is j = m a which we will assume is
positive2. the extremal limit corresponds to a2 = m 2, so  = (r  m )2 and the event
horizon is at r = m . the area of the extremal horizon is

2 we have set g = 1 where g is the four dimensional newtons constant.

a = 8m 2 = 8j

(2.4)

3

the value of  at the horizon is called the angular velocity of the horizon and, in the
extremal case, is simply  = 1/2m . since grr = 2/ it is clear that the spatial distance
to the extremal horizon in a constant t surface is innite. in analogy to the extreme charged

black holes, we wish to extract the limiting geometry as one moves down this throat.

to describe this near horizon geometry, we set

r = m + r,

t =

(2.5)

and take the limit   0. the shift from  to  makes /t tangent to the horizon. in

where we have dened r2
show that it is similar to ads2  s2 in many respects. for example, if one sets  = 0 (or
) one sees that the spacetime along the axis is precisely ads2. it is clear that by rescaling
t, one can ensure that r0 only appears as an overall factor in front of the metric.

it is easy to see that (2.6) has enhanced symmetry.

in addition to the /t and
/ symmetries present in kerr, (2.6) is clearly invariant under r  cr, t  t/c for any
constant c. so (2.6) has the dilation symmetry of ads2. it is less obvious, but still true,
that (2.6) is also invariant under (an analog of) the global time translation in ads2. to
see this, note that the (r, t) coordinates are analogous to poincare coordinates on ads2.
to nd the extra global time translation symmetry, we introduce new coordinates which

are related to (r, t) in the same way that the global coordinates of ads2 are related to the
poincare coordinates. for simplicity, we set r0 = 1. let

r = (1 + y2)1/2 cos  + y,

t =

(1 + y2)1/2 sin 

r

.

(2.7)

the new axial angle coordinate  is chosen so that gy = 0, with the result

in these new coordinates, the throat metric (2.6) takes the form

(2.9)

note that the  = 0 hypersurface coincides with a t = 0 hypersurface, and that  =  on

this hypersurface (and also at innity, for all time).

the throat solution (2.9) thus has all of the symmetries of ads2 plus translations in
: its isometry group is sl(2, r)  u (1). all geometric quantities depend only on . we
will show below that the coordinates in (2.9) (with  <  < ,  < y < ) cover
the entire spacetime. the surfaces of constant  are always spacelike, so  is a global time

function and this spacetime has no closed timelike curves. however the killing eld /
is not timelike everywhere. it is timelike for all  when y2 < 1/3, but asymptotically is
spacelike for sin  > (1 + cos2 )/2, or sin  > 0.536, within 32.4 degrees of the equatorial

plane. this is a consequence of the rotation and is analogous to the ergosphere in the
extreme kerr solution3. it will be convenient to dene the vector eld

 =


  y




.

(2.10)

 is a future directed timelike vector everywhere, which is orthogonal to the surfaces of

constant  and tangent to the surfaces of constant y.

there are two boundaries at innity corresponding to y = . since a surface of
constant y is always timelike, the limiting surfaces y =  must be timelike or null. the
boundary will be timelike if geodesics can reach it in a nite value of  . we now show that

this is the case. in the process, we will also show that (2.9) is geodesically complete. hence

the solution is nonsingular, and the coordinates (, y, , ) cover the entire spacetime.

since we are mostly interested in the asymptotic properties of the geodesics it suces

to consider geodesics with constant . this corresponds to  = 0, /2. it is clear that

test particles moving along the axis  = 0 will behave exactly as in ads2. in particular,
timelike geodesics never reach innity, and null geodesics reach innity in a nite time.

the equatorial plane,  = /2, is a three dimensional homogeneous space with symmetry
group sl(2, r)  u (1). it is a twisted product of ads2 and a circle of constant radius.
consider a geodesic with momentum p =  (/ ) + y(/y) + (/), where a dot

denotes derivative with respect to an ane parameter. the conserved quantities are

l = p  / = 2(  + y  ),

e = p  / =

1 + y2

2

  ly

setting g p p  = 2 yields

y2  4(e + ly)2 + (22 + l2)(1 + y2) = 0

(2.11)

(2.12)

3 this is not exactly the same as the original ergosphere, since / is not a killing eld in

the full kerr metric.

5

geodesics with zero angular momentum again behave exactly like geodesics in ads2. that
is, massive particles feel an innite potential barrier and stay conned to nite |y|. massless
particles can reach innity, but since y is proportional to the ane parameter, these

geodesics are obviously complete. one can easily verify that these geodesics reach innity
in a nite time  . timelike geodesics with l2 < 22/3 are also conned. however,
geodesics with l2 > 22/3 can escape to innity. this is a qualitatively new feature of
(2.9) which is not present in ads2  s2. since  (2.10) is a future directed timelike vector
everywhere, it follows that p   > 0 which implies e + yl > 0. thus, a geodesic with
l > 0 can only escape to y = +, while a geodesic with l < 0 can only escape to y = .
since y  y asymptotically these geodesics are also complete, and reach innity in a nite
value of  . geodesics with l2 = 22/3 satisfy y2 = 8ely asymptotically. so once again
if l > 0, these geodesics can reach y =  but not y = . for l < 0, the situation is
reversed. these geodesics are also complete and reach innity in nite  .

for product spacetimes such as ads2  s2, one can remove the angular directions,
and conformally rescale ads2 to view innity as a nite boundary. then the killing
elds of ads2 become conformal symmetries of the boundary. one cannot do this for the
throat solution since the geometry does not approach a product metric asymptotically.

if one wants to bring innity in to a nite distance, the best one can do is to rescale

the entire metric, although the conformal metric is no longer smooth at the boundary.

for convenience, we start with the metric in poincare coordinates (2.6) (although we set
r0 = 1). multiplying by 1/r2 and setting x = 1/r the metric becomes

ds2 =(cid:18) 1 + cos2

since they are killing elds of (2.6), they are conformal killing elds of (2.13) with action
l(r2g) = (lr2)g = (2r/r)(r2g ). the net result is that 1 and 2 remain

6

killing elds of the rescaled metric, 3 multiplies the metric (2.13) by two, and 4 multiplies
the metric by 2t. thus the last three generate the conformal group on a line with metric
dt2. this can be realized explicitly by introducing a cuto at x =  and shifting  =
  t/. then the metric on the x =  surface is essentially the product of a line and a
very small sphere.

3. modes of a massless scalar field

an important feature of test elds on ads2  s2 is that they naturally obey reecting
boundary conditions at innity. (this is true for all modes with nontrivial dependence
on s2.) the wave solutions have a discrete spectrum, with no oscillatory behavior near

innity. we will show that a similar connement holds for axisymmetric modes in the

extremal kerr throat geometry. however, as might be suspected from the behavior of

geodesics with large angular momentum found in section 2, some non-axisymmetric modes

do propagate all the way to innity and transport energy and angular momentum there.

these scattering states have a continuous spectrum. this behavior is expected be generic

for waves of all spins. we illustrate it with a discussion of solutions of the massless scalar

wave equation.

the scalar wave equation for a spacetime described by a metric of the form (2.1) can

be written as

(3.1)

(3.2)

in taking the near horizon limit (2.5), the throat frequency  is related to the kerr fre-

quency  by

  mh = .

(3.3)

where h is the angular velocity of the horizon. therefore, as   0 all nite frequencies
in the throat correspond to the single frequency  = mh = m/2m in the exterior.

modes in kerr with  = mh are special since they are totally reected, and not
absorbed by the black hole. this can be seen from the following argument, which applies

7

to all kerr black holes, and not just extremal ones (see [13]). let  = (/t) be the

usual stationary killing eld. the null vector tangent to the horizon of a kerr black hole
is l =  + h(/ ). since l = 0 on the horizon, the energy ux entering the
black hole is obtained by integrating t l = ()(l ) over the horizon. this is
proportional to ( mh ). so modes with  > mh have a positive energy ux into the
black hole and correspond to normal scattering. modes with  < mh have a negative
energy ux and correspond to superradiant scattering: the outgoing wave has more energy

than the incoming one. modes with exactly  = mh are on the borderline. no energy
is absorbed by the black hole. the modes we will study in the throat geometry can be

thought of as obtained by starting with a mode in the extreme kerr metric satisfying

 = mh + . for small , most of this wave is reected and only a small part remains
near the horizon. after the rescaling (2.5), the wave near the horizon remains nonzero in
the limit   0, and completely decouples from the wave in the asymptotically at region.
the form of the throat metric in poincare and global ads2 coordinates becomes
identical as the respective radial coordinates r and y become large, so the asymptotic

properties of the wave solutions are the same in both coordinate systems. for deniteness,

we will use the global coordinates. since the metric (2.9) is of the general form (2.1),

the wave equation in this background takes the form (3.1) for suitable choice of metric
components. this wave equation, after multiplication by 2, is completely separable, just

as it is for the original kerr metric. setting  = y (y)() splits the partial dierential

equation into the two ordinary dierential equations

the separation constant k has been dened so that the angular equation is identical to

the spheroidal harmonic angular equation familiar from solutions on the kerr background,

with the kerr frequency set to the unique value implied by (3.3).

the eigensolutions of (3.5) with boundary conditions of regularity at  = 0 and  =

spectrum.

where c is roughly in the range .13 to .22 and l  |m| are integers.

the radial equation for axisymmetric modes is identical to that for ads2. the natural
boundary condition at innity is  = 0. then   |y|l1, and normal modes satisfying
the boundary conditions at both y = + and y =  exist for discrete real frequencies
ln. waves are reected before they reach innity.

the non-axisymmetric modes are more interesting. the asymptotic solutions for

|y|  1 are power laws y  |y|, with

(3.7)

for k > kcrit  2m2  1/4 both exponents are real, qualitatively like the axisymmetric
modes. only the more rapidly decaying solution satises the boundary condition, and
global normal modes exist for discrete frequencies. on the other hand, if k < 2m2  1/4
the exponents are complex, and the asymptotic solutions are traveling waves. positive

frequency modes are outgoing in phase velocity if im  > 0 and ingoing if im  < 0.

from the above table, it is clear that for m = 1, all eigenvalues k are larger than kcrit =
2m2  1/4, but for all |m| > 1 at least the l = |m| eigenvalue is less than kcrit. this
is qualitatively dierent from ads2, since in the absence of rotation the condition for
connement is k = l(l + 1) > m2  1/4, which is always satised.

the phase velocity is just /k. so for m > 0, the phase velocity and group velocity have

opposite signs for large negative y. for m < 0, they have opposite signs for large positive

y. this has an important consequence, which we now explain.

since k is always larger than m2, the expression inside the brackets in (3.8) always

changes sign around  + my = 0. this means that the wave encounters a potential

barrier and the wkb approximation breaks down. an initial wave with  > 0 and

m > 0 moving in the negative y direction will be partly reected and partly transmitted

through this barrier. we now have to discuss the physical boundary conditions on these

waves. first note that all modes vanish at innity. even when  is complex, we still have
y  |y|1/2. but since the volume element on a surface of constant y is proportional
to |y| asymptotically, there can still be a nonzero ux of energy and angular momentum
to innity. we demand that the transmitted wave should be purely outgoing, where

outgoing is dened with respect to the physical group velocity.

to compute the ux of energy and angular momentum, note that each killing vector

eld of the spacetime produces a conserved ux 4-vector when contracted with the energy-

momentum tensor of the wave. the axial killing eld is the unique killing eld with closed
orbits, and gives the angular momentum ux vector j  = t 

 . the average rate (per unit
global time  ) of angular momentum transport in the +y direction across a constant-y

surface is equal to

z dd (g)1/2 t y

 =z dd sin  (1 + y2)





y

.

(3.10)

after averaging over time, and taking the limit y   with asymptotically y =
a+yi(2m21/4k)1/21/2 for the outgoing positive frequency wave solution, the angular
momentum transport rate becomes m(2m2  1/4 k)1/2|a+|2, assuming the angular har-
monics are normalized. using the killing eld / to dene a conserved energy ux,

the asymptotic energy transport rate is /m times the angular momentum transport rate

calculated above, and for positive frequency waves is outward for waves with an outward

phase velocity.

we now come to the key point. consider a wave with  > 0, m > 0 which starts at

large y moving in the negative y direction. after scattering o the potential barrier, there

will be a reected wave and transmitted wave. in order for the transmitted wave to have

outgoing group velocity, it must have incoming phase velocity. thus there is a incoming
ux of energy from y = . since this energy is conserved, there must be a corresponding
outgoing ux of energy at y = . since we started with an incoming wave at y = , the

10

only way this is possible is if the reected wave carries more energy than the initial wave.

in this sense, waves in the throat geometry exhibit superradiance.

another way to understand the dierence in sign between the group velocity and

phase velocity is to consider a local observer who is at rest with respect to the constant

 surfaces, and hence has a four velocity proportional to  (2.10). such a zero angular

momentum observer (zamo) at constant y = yo and , would assign a frequency to the
wave

zam o =

 + myo

[(1 + y2

o)(1 + cos2 )/2)]1/2 .

(3.11)

at large positive yo with negative m or large negative yo with positive m the zamo would
assign a negative frequency to the wave, and according to him the direction of the phase

velocity is the same as the group velocity. the local timelike killing eld tangent to the
zamos worldline is 

 . if this were used to dene the energy ux, the energy

  yo

ux would be in the same direction as the group velocity.

quantum mechanically, the full extreme kerr metric radiates particles even though

its hawking temperature is zero. the emitted particles all lie in the superradiant regime

 < mh [14]. since the modes we consider correspond to  = mh one might wonder if
this implies that the throat metric will be quantum mechanically stable. however the fact

that the throat solution itself exhibits superradiance suggests that it will decay quantum
mechanically also. presumably, if one starts with an sl(2, r)  u (1) invariant vacuum
state, these symmetries will be preserved. it is then far from clear what the solution (2.9)

could decay into. this question requires further investigation.

classically, the question of stability to linearized perturbations is the question of

whether there are unstable quasinormal modes obeying outgoing wave boundary conditions

at both innities. our expectation, in the absence of detailed investigation, is that no such

unstable quasinormal modes exist, based on the known stability of kerr black holes [15]. on

the other hand, when back reaction is taken into account the throat geometry is unstable,

and nearby solutions are singular. this follows from the singularity theorems [16] since

the constant (y,  ) two-spheres are marginally trapped. a generic perturbation will cause

the orthogonal null geodesics to start converging, creating trapped surfaces and geodesic

incompleteness. if the nearby solutions are all black holes, then this instability need not be

a serious problem. but since the singularity theorems do not prove the existence of event

horizons, one does not yet know if more serious singularities can arise. in order to apply this

instability argument, one only needs to ensure that the nearby spacetimes satisfy einsteins

11

equation with matter obeying the weak energy condition. the same argument applies to
ads2  s2 and shows that this spacetime is also unstable. (for another argument to this
eect see [5].) however, this argument does not apply to products of higher dimensional

ads and spheres, since the null geodesics orthogonal to the sphere consist of an entire

light cone in ads which is expanding. so in the higher dimensional case, the spheres are
not marginally trapped and e.g. ads5  s5 is stable.

the instability of the throat geometry may not be a serious obstacle to constructing a
dual quantum mechanical theory since it has been argued in the case of ads2s2 that the
dual theory may describe just the ground states of string theory with these boundary

conditions [5]. we will see in section ve that a similar argument applies to our throat

geometry.

4. extension to extreme kerr-newman throats

while our main interest is in vacuum solutions, we note that our results can easily

be generalized to include the entire range of extreme kerr-newman solutions describing

rotating and charged black holes. their near horizon geometries smoothly interpolate
between the solution (2.9) and ads2  s2. the kerr-newman metrics have exactly the
same form as (2.1), except that  = r2  2m r + a2 + q2, where q is the electric charge and
am is still the angular momentum; and the 2m r factor in  is replaced by r2 + a2  .
the extremal limit corresponds to m 2 = a2 + q2, and the horizon is at r = m with area
0  m 2 + a2, the throat metric is similar to (2.6) with only
4(m 2 + a2). if we dene r2
two modications: the factor (1 + cos2 )/2 becomes 1  a2
sin2 , and there is a dierent
coecient in the frame-dragging angular velocity. expanding  to rst order in r  m , we
now obtain

notice that when a = 0, this metric reduces to ads2  s2 as expected. the change in the
coecient of the o diagonal term carries over to the change of the coecient in front of

the log in the relation (2.8) between  and . otherwise, the transformation to the global

throat geometry (2.9) in the global coordinates.

an interesting point along the kerr-newman sequence is when connement of modes

this happens rst for m2  1, when a2

of elds (e.g., electromagnetic or gravitational perturbations) will dier somewhat from

this.

5. searching for a holographic dual

in light of the growing evidence in favor of the ads/cft correspondence, it is nat-

ural to speculate that string theory on spacetimes that approach (2.9) will have a dual

holographic description. since the boundary at innity is eectively one dimensional, and

sl(2, r) is the conformal group of a line, one expects the dual theory to be a conformal

quantum mechanical system. we have already pointed out several ways in which (2.9) is
qualitatively similar to ads2  s2, which is the near horizon geometry of an extremely
charged four dimensional black hole. so one might expect that the dual theories might
be similar, with the su (2) symmetry of s2 broken to u (1) in the vacuum case, breaking
supersymmetry as well. unfortunately, ads2  s2 is currently the least well understood
example of the ads/cft correspondence. we currently have little information about the

structure of this quantum mechanical system.

let us rst try to follow the procedure used to discover the original ads/cft duality.

starting with the extreme black hole, we can decrease the string coupling g to obtain a

weakly coupled string description of the black hole states. the fact that the entropy of

an extreme kerr black hole is independent of newtons constant and simply given by the

13

angular momentum (which we still assume is positive), s = 2j, strongly suggests that

it has a simple microscopic description. in fact, it may ultimately be simpler than the

reissner-nordstrom solution which requires four dierent charges from the fundamental

string standpoint. since an extreme kerr black hole has no ramond-ramond elds present,

the states at weak coupling must be ordinary excited states of the string. unfortunately,

the lack of supersymmetry makes it dicult at present to give a precise identication of
the states4. one can instead use the correspondence principle [18] to roughly describe

these states as follows. since angular momentum is quantized, we want to keep j xed
as we slowly decrease the string coupling. the mass of the black hole is gm 2 = j and

its horizon radius is r+ = gm , where g is the four dimensional newtons constant. the
correspondence principle says that the black hole makes a transition to an excited string

state when its horizon size is of order the string scale. setting the mass of the black hole

equal to the mass of an excited string state at this point yields

mbh 

s
g 

n
s  ms

(5.1)

where n is the string level. since g  g22
point. the black hole entropy is then

s, this implies that g  n1/4 at the transition

sbh  gm 2  m r+  m s 

n

(5.2)

since gm 2 = j and j is xed, the appropriate weakly coupled string states are states
with n  j 2 and angular momentum j. (this was also noticed in [19].) the number of
such states is approximately e

n which agrees with the entropy of the black hole.

states with n  j 2 and angular momentum j are far from extremal string states.
the minimum mass string state carrying angular momentum j has n = j, but there

is only one such state, so it could never reproduce the entropy of the black hole. one

might ask what happens if one starts with a string state with less energy than the states

corresponding to the extreme black hole and increase the coupling. it appears that you

might be in danger of forming a naked singularity. but, of course, this is not what happens.
if n < j 2, then m s < j, but the minimum size of the string is rmin = j/m , so rmin > s.
this means that the string cannot form a black hole at the string scale but only at a larger

4 when charges are present, one can give a precise counting of the states of certain extreme

charged and rotating black holes, even when they are far from the supersymmetric state [17].

14

scale corresponding to a larger value of the string coupling. setting the masses equal at

this transition point, the resulting black hole will have a schwarzschild radius at least

r+ = j/m = a which would again correspond to an extreme kerr black hole.

in terms of trying to construct a dual theory, the obvious problem is that these excited

string states are not stable. it is not clear how to take an appropriate limit to decouple
the bulk string states and extract the dynamics of the states at a given level n  j 2.

solution (4.2). the area of the horizon at r = 0 is a = 4r2

a clue to the correct description may be the following: consider the form of the
0 = 2a2 + q2. thus
the extreme black hole entropy is related to the radius of curvature of the ads2 space
along the axis in a universal way which is independent of the ratio of charge to angular

0 where r2

momentum. this suggests that there may be a unied description of string theory with

these boundary conditions.

it was pointed out in [5] that the energy above extremality e of a near extremal
reissner-nordstrom black hole scales with temperature like e = 22q3t 2p where p is
the planck length. the fact that p enters this formula means that one cannot take p  0
keeping e, q, t xed. it is easy to see that the same thing is true for the entire family

of near extreme kerr-newman solutions. for simplicity, we restrict here to the pure kerr

case. including factors of newtons constant, the hawking temperature is

t =

(g2m 2  a2)1/2

4gm [gm + (g2m 2  a2)1/2]

(5.3)

in the extremal limit, gm = a. let gm = a + , and dene e = m  (a/g) = /g. then
we have t = (2gm )1/2/4g2m 2, so e = 82t 2g2m 3. but gm 2 = j so

e = 82j 3/2t 2p

(5.4)

6. five dimensional throat geometries

generalizations of the kerr metric to more than three space dimensions have been

discussed thoroughly by myers and perry [10]. in n space (plus one time) dimensions

there are [n/2] independent planes of rotation in which axial symmetry can be enforced

simultaneously, with the same number of independent angular momentum parameters.
the spatial coordinates reecting this symmetry consist of [n/2] axial angles, [(n  1)/2]
polar angles, and one radial coordinate. extremal vacuum black holes with a non-singular

degenerate horizon do not exist in all cases, but when they do, we expect that the near

15

horizon limit leads to a complete spacetime with an sl(2, r) u (1)[n/2] symmetry group.
as an illustrative example, we work through some of the details for the 5d (n = 4) case.
in ve dimensions, let  and  denote the two axial angles, a and b the correspond-
ing angular momentum parameters, and dene a mass parameter  with units of length

squared. the physical mass of the black hole is m = 3/8g5, and the factor 2m/3
converts angular momentum parameters to physical angular momenta. the metric in

boyer-lindquist coordinates (equation (3.18) of [10]) reduces to

ds2 = dt2 +


2 (dt  a sin2 d   b cos2 d )2

+(r2 + a2) sin2 d 2 + (r2 + b2) cos2 d 2 + 2d2 +

2r2


dr2,

where

2  r2 + a2 cos2  + b2 sin2 ,

  (r2 + a2)(r2 + b2)  r2.

(6.1)

(6.2)

the range of the polar angle  is 0    /2. since no odd powers of r are present, it is
convenient to work with u  r2 as the radial coordinate, with

guu =

2
4

.

(6.3)

the horizon is at the outermost zero of . this is a double zero, implying an extremal
horizon, if  = (|a| + |b|)2. the extremal horizon is at u = |ab|. unless both angular
momentum parameters are non-zero the horizon is singular, since 2 on the horizon is zero
at  = 0 if a = 0 or at  = /2 if b = 0, and 2 = 0 implies a curvature singularity. the
3-volume of the horizon is 22|ab|1/2(|a| + |b|)2.

we focus on the inverse metric tensor, since it is the inverse metric tensor that comes

into the carter hamilton-jacobi formulation of the geodesic equations and the scalar eld

equation. in particular, note that the coordinate angular velocities of a zamo are given
by   = g t/gtt and   = g t/gtt, or

 =



a(u + b2)



,

 =



b(u + a2)

where

the inverse square of the lapse function is

  (u + a2)(u + b2) + 2.

despite its rather complicated appearance, one immediately sees the characteristic

structure of ads2 in (6.12), with the horizon at u = 0. eqs. (6.14) - (6.16) are all just
functions of . this metric has essentially the same set of ads2-like killing vector elds as

17

the 4-d kerr throat metric. an almost identical transformation to global time coordinate

 , radial coordinate y, in which

u =h(1 + y2)1/2 cos  + yi ,

t =

(1 + y2)1/2 sin 

u

(6.17)

and new axial angle coordinates  and  related to  and  by expressions like (2.8) with

appropriate coecients in front of the logs, gives a globally non-singular metric describing

a geodesically complete spacetime. the total number of killing elds is ve, since there

are two axial killing elds instead of one.

two special cases are worth mentioning. when the two angular momenta components
are equal, the metric simplies and 2 = 2a2 no longer depends on . setting a = b > 0,

the metric (not the inverse metric) becomes

when one of the angular momenta vanishes, the horizon of the extreme black hole

becomes singular. it is a surprising fact that if one takes the near horizon limit in this
case, one nds a spacetime with ads3 symmetry5! we start with the general solution (6.1)
with b = 0, and set  = a2 to obtain the extremal limit. we then shift  =  + t/a, and
rescale r = r, t = t/,  = / taking   0. the result is

however, we can clearly extend  <  <  and obtain a ve dimensional vacuum

above solution looks like a product of ads3 and a disk, but is singular at  = /2. it is

not yet clear whether this singularity justies throwing this solution away as unphysical.

there are many examples of singular solutions which play a prominent role in string theory

(e.g. the metric of most d-branes). yet some singular metrics are clearly unphysical (e.g.

the negative mass schwarzschild solution). the prominent role of ads3 in this vacuum
solution justies further investigation.

solutions of the geodesic equations in the general metric (6.12) - (6.16) can be ob-

tained by separation of variables in the hamiltonian-jacobi formalism [20]. the gen-

erating function s for the canonical transformation to coordinates which are constants
of the motion obeys an equation derived by substituting s
x for p in the expression
gpp = 2 = s
 , where  is the ane parameter. since pt = e, p = l, and
p = l are trivial conserved quantities, the equation for s becomes

complicated. the qualitative picture is just as it was in the four dimensional case.

7. conclusion

we have explored the near horizon geometry of an extreme rotating black hole in the

hopes that it will be useful in extending the remarkable duality between string theory and

eld theory to the vacuum case. it is not yet clear whether this will succeed. while the
vacuum solutions we have discussed have striking similarities to the ads2  s2 geometry
arising in the near horizon limit of extreme reissner-nordstrom black holes, there are some

crucial dierences. these include the fact that in addition to the usual localized modes of

a test eld with discrete frequencies, there are also traveling waves with continuous fre-

quencies that exhibit a type of superradiance. the quantum analog of this superradiance,

and its possible implications for duality, remains to be explored.

another open question raised by this work is the nature of the singularity in the ve

dimensional vacuum solution with ads3 symmetry discussed in the previous section. does
this solution have physical interest?
