abstract

we have done a study of the zero-dimensional 4 model. firstly, we exhibit the partition

function as a simple exact expression in terms of the macdonalds function for re() > 0.

secondly, an analytic continuation of the partition function for re() < 0 is performed, and

we obtain an expression dened in the complex coupling constant plane , for |arg | < .
consequently, the partition function understood as an analytic continuation is dened for

all values of , except for a branch cut along the real negative  axis. we also evaluate the

partition function on perturbative grounds, using the borel summation technique and we

found that in the common domain of validity for re() > 0, it coincides precisely with the

exact expression.

1 introduction

it is largely accepted that some insight on the behavior of greens functions in field theories and

statistical systems may be obtained by the analysis of zero-dimensional models [1] [2]. in particular

it is expected that an exact understanding of some aspects of zero-dimensional eld theories

could leave trails about the non-perturbative behaviour of these theories in higher dimensions.

in this sense, bender et al. [3] for instance, have proposed an analytical approach to study non-

perturbativelly quantum eld theories, which requires to solve the corresponding zero-dimensional

model. in the context of perturbative eld theory, for the study of the summability of series giving

evaluations of physical quantities, an exact analysis of a zero-dimensional eld theory could help

to obtain information about the large order terms behavior in the perturbative series of realistic

models. in particular, we may have in mind the paper of bender and wu [4], who have obtained

the precise asymptotic behavior for n   of the n-th order rayleigh-schrodinger coecient
in the series for the energy levels of the anharmonic oscillator. a precise knowledge of these

coecients for arbitrary n is still missing, only bounds for their absolute values are available for

nite generic values of n, even large.

zinn-justin [5] studying perturbation around instantons has used explicitly the zero dimen-

sional 4 model in order to introduce some basic ideas to perform a detailed analysis based

on numerical simulations, of the large order behavior of the perturbative expansion of various

models. as noticed by parisi [6] and also by khuri [7] the nature of the large order estimates

is strongly dependent on the analytic structure of the (presumably) summed perturbative series

f () = pn fnn as a function of the coupling constant . a pioneering work on the subject was

done by dyson [8], who remarked that for negative  = e2 in (qed)4 the vacuum is metastable

with a meanlife  e
phasizes that since any physical quantity evaluated by perturbative methods is not analytic at

|| , and that a cut along the negative real -axis is present. dyson em-

vanishing value of the coupling constant, the asymptotic expansion is not sucient to determine

the quantity uniquely. parisi, [6] using a functional representation of f () for re() < 0, still

makes the important observation that a detailed knowledge of the imaginary part at negative

values of  would be necessary to improve dysons work. in other words, to obtain more detailed

estimates for the coecients in the perturbative series, a better control of the imaginary part of

f () for negative re() is required. it is worthwhile to remark that non-hermitian or unbounded

hamiltonians, in particular (i3) and (4) models have been recently investigated by bender
[9]. arguing from the fact that the model (4) is asymptotically free, these authors
et al.
suggest that this theory should be useful for describing the higgs boson. historically, this idea of

investigating the negative coupling scalar model in view of implementing asymptotic freedom is

in fact present in the literature since the 70s [10].

in another branch or theoretical physics, zero-dimensional eld models can have a direct in-

terest to the study of disordered systems, in particular to systems presenting frustration, which

is associated to negative couplings in eld theory language. these systems have been studied,

both from a diagrammatic lattice viewpoint (quenched random graphs) by for instance bachas et

al.

[11] and baillie et al.

[12], or on more rigorous mathematical grounds by derrida [13] and

aizeman et al. [14].

perhaps an exact solution of the zero-dimensional 4 model could throw some light on the

above described situations. in any case, it is clear that a main step to these kind of studies should

be to understand how correlation functions behave for complex coupling constant, in particular

for complex coupling constants having a negative real part. in this note we intend to go in this

sense, by reducing an interacting system to its simplest possible form, the zero-dimensional 4

model. as a counterpart, an exact treatment is possible.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 the basic features of zero-dimensional eld

theory are reviwed. in section 3 we exhibit a non-perturbative (exact form) for the zero dimensional

2

partition function and the analytic continuation in the coupling constant to the whole complex

plane is performed. also the exact form of the partition function is compared to the expression

obtained from borel summation of the perturbative series.

in this paper we use the standard

convention h = kb = 1. concluding remarks are in section 4.

2 zero-dimensional eld theory

let p ()  0 be a probability distribution over a random variable. the moments < n > of the
probability distribution are obtained from the generating function,

z(j) = z dp ()ej ,

by successive derivatives,

< n >= r d np ()
r dp ()

=

z(0) " nz(j)

j n #j=0

suppose that p () in eq.(1) has the general form

p () = e

2 a1+f (,),

(1)

(2)

(3)

f (, ) being a regular function depending on some parameter  (coupling constant). then using

the identity f ( 

j )ej  = f ()ej  the generating function may be written in the form,

z(j) = z(0)ef (

which generates the diagrammatic expansion.

in this note we consider the model with a quartic probability distribution in which the partition

function is given by,

z(m2, g) = z

the even order moments of this probability distribution can be obtained by successive derivatives

respect to m2,

< 2n >=

n

(m2)n ln z(m2, g).

(6)

the partition function given by eq.(5) has a contribution from the vacuum diagrams, and its

perturbative expansion may be written in the form [15],

where the coecients are given by

z(m2 = 1, g) =



(g)nzn,

xn=0

zn =

(4n  1)!!
(4!)nn!

.

(7)

(8)

since the coecient zn increases as nn, the series that denes the partition function is divergent.

in this perturbative context, many authors claim that the point g = 0 is an essential singularity

of z(m2 = 1, g), with a cut on the negative real axis. in other words, the perturbative series may

have zero radius of convergence. nevertheless, resummation techniques can be used to deal with

this non-convergent series. it is important to stress that in real models in eld theory the same

kind of problem appears when the perturbative series is asymptotic but divergent for nite values

of the coupling constant. actually, t hooft and lautrup [16] showed that in the 4 model the

borel transform of the perturbative series has renormalons, which prevents borel summability.

in this case an alternative method which takes into account the existence of renormalons was

developed by khuri [7].

in the zero dimensional model, although for negative g the partition function is not dened,

an analytic continuation from positive g can be performed by considering the contribution from

the saddle points, as was remarked by langer [17].

in this paper, we adopt an easier way to

obtain information from the region re(g) < 0. although the partition function, when re(g) < 0

is divergent, we are able to recover this divergence as singularities of a function dened on the

complex coupling constant plane. in other words, we will obtain rst an exact expression in terms

4

of bessel functions of the second kind for the partition function in the domain re(g) > 0, and

after this step, we analytically extend this function to the complex plane (i.e. also in the region

where the original partition function diverges, re(g) < 0). we take this analytic continuation to

the whole coupling constant complex plane as our denition of the partition function.

3 the analytic continuation of the partition function

we have two dierent steps to accomplish: the rst one is to nd a representation in terms of

special functions of eq.(5), and the second one is to perform the analytic extension in the g-variable

to the region re(g) < 0. we accomplish our rst step by a simple inspection in gradhstein and

ryzhik [18]. integrals of the type in eq.(5) can be expressed as

for re() > 0, which means that the partition function given by eq. (5) may be exactly expressed

in terms of the bessel function of the second kind k 1

function becomes

z(m2, ) = s 2

valid for re() > 0. an inspection of eq. (11) seems to indicate in the analytic structure of

z(m2, ) the existence of an essential singularity at  = 0. actually, as we will see later on, this

is only apparent, the only singularity present in the analytically continued partition function is a

branch cut for values of  lying along the negative real axis. we will perform our second step, by

analytically extending the partition function z(m2, ) to the region re() < 0, i.e. to the whole

complex -plane.

this analytical continuation may be done by simply starting from the following representation

for the bessel functions of the second kind [19],

k(z) = r 
valid for |arg(z)| < , re() >  1
continuation for z(m2, ) in the whole complex -plane except for a cut along the negative real

we have thus as a starting point a formula for the partition function dened for re() > 0.

it happens that this function has a representation dened as an analytic function on the domain

|arg | < . hence, we have an analytic extension of the partition function for the whole complex
in other words, we have an exact
plane of the coupling constant , except for |arg | = .
expression for the partition function valid in the whole coupling constant complex plane except for

a branch cut on the real negative axis. actually, we may obtain in a closed form an expression for

the partition function. from the representation of macdonalds function in terms of the conuent

hypergeometric function,

k(z) = q()(2z) ez( +

1
2

, 2 + 1, 2z),

we obtain replacing the above representation in eq. (11) the simple expression,

z(m2, ) =

(14)

(15)

we remark that the (a, c, z) is a many-valued function of z, and we shall consider in the above

equation its principal branch in the plane cut along the negative real axis. the analytic continu-

ation of k 1

4

( 1
) corresponds to the denition of z(m2, ) on the whole complex -plane except for

a branch cut for |arg | = .

6

the plots of the real and imaginary parts of the analytically continued partition function given

by eq. (13) are in (g.1) and (g.2). we see from these gures that the real part of the partition

function is perfectly regular for any complex values of . the branch cut for  on the negative

real axis appears only in the imaginary part of the partition function.

it does not appear in

those graphics an essential singularity at  = 0, as claimed by many authors. indeed, using the

expansion for the bessel function of the second kind for small , we get from eqs. (13), (12) and

(11) a taylor series for the partition function,

z(m2, )|m2=1 = 1

valid for |arg()| < , which clearly shows the absence of an essential singularity of the partition
function at  = 0.

it is interesting to compare our exact result in eq.(15) or eq.(13) with the partition function

obtained from perturbative methods as in eqs.(7) and (8). since, as argued in [15] the series in

eq.(7) is asymptotic, we dene its borel transform as

b(b) =

zn
n!



xn=0

(b)n,

(17)

and replacing zn from eq.(8) in the above expression we can show that the borel transformed

series b(b) is convergent, given by an hypergeometric function,

b(b) = f (

; 1;

2b
3

).

(18)

then, from the watson-nevanlinna-sokal theorem [21], the divergent series in eq.(7) is borel

summable and, remembering that  = 4g

3 and using eq. (18), its borel sum is given by

zpert(m2 = 1, ) =

(19)

the above representation for the partition function obtained using the borel summation technique

is valid for re() > 0,  belonging to a disc cr = { : re(1) > 1

r}, that is, the borel summed

7

expression for the partition function is restricted to positive values of the real part of the coupling

constant. in this region the borel summed expression for the partition function coincides precisely

with the exact partition function eq. (11) for re() > 0. for re() < 0 the borel summed

partition function is no longer valid. the analytically continued exact expression given by eq.(15)

or by e.(13) should then be used.

the even order moments 2n for all complex values of  except for  lying on the real negative

axis can be obtained exactly from eq.(15) or from eq.(13) (remembering that  = 4g

3m4 ) by direct

application of eq.(6). we note, in connection to the idea of perturbation around some kinds of

non-gaussian probability distributions (instantons) in the paper by zinn-justin [5], that we can

work out perturbation theory around the quartic probability distribution eq.(5) using its exact

analytically extended expression (15) or (13), not necessarily restricted to positive real  values.

then a possible extension of this work is to introduce a 6 term in the partition function to

discuss the tricritical singularity in this oversimplyed model [22].

4 conclusions

in quantum eld theory it is well known that the separation of the hamiltonian into the free

and the interaction part leads to conceptual problems in many models, since the perturbative

expansion based on the free part is divergent. in these situations the interaction part should not

be used as a small perturbation, because at the origin of the interaction parameter an essential

singularity would be present. the main idea is to include the interaction part in the new denition

of a unperturbated hamiltonian. it is expected that if it is possible to implement such a program,

it would be equivalent to the resummation of the perturbative series taking into account non-

perturbative eects. in this paper we have used this idea to solve the zero dimensional 4 model.

using the principle of analytic continuation, we have obtained an exact expression for the partition

8

function of the model dened on the complex coupling constant plane, which presents no essential

singularity at the origin. we compare the borel summed form zpert(m2 = 1, ) of the partition

function and our exact expression and we have a perfect agreement between the two functions in

their common domain of validity.
