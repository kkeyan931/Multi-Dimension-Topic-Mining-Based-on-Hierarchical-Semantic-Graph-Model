the  evolution  of  the  distribution-theoretic  methods  in  perturbative  quantum  field  theory  is  re-
viewed starting from bogolyubovs pioneering 1952 work with emphasis on the theory and cal-
culations of perturbation theory integrals.

i would like to review the origin and evolution of the idea that
generalized functions  (distributions)  play  with  respect  to  inte-
grals of perturbative quantum field theory (pqft) a role simi-
lar to that of complex numbers with respect to polynomials.

what makes this topic interesting and instructive is the ap-
parent contradiction between the proven power of the distribu-
tion-theoretic  methods  in  pqft  (it  would  be  enough  to  men-
tion  the  bogolyubov  r-operation)  and  the  low  awareness  of
theorists of this powerful technique.

s om e   hi s t or y.   singular generalized functions had been
emerging  in  various  applications  (recall  diracs  d -function).
sobolev [1] found a systematic way to define such generalized
functions as linear functionals on suitably chosen spaces of test
functions.  the  most  universally  useful  variant  of  the  theory
was  suggested  by  schwartz  [2]  (the  so-called  distributions;  i
will  use  the  term  interchangeably  with  generalized  functions)
who  made  a  great  effort  to  propagandize  the  simplicity  and
power of the technique of distributions [3] as did gelfand and
shilov  [4].  there  is  nothing  inherently  difficult  in  the  idea  of
generalized function, and the theory can be taught in an almost
elementary fashion [5]. distributions ought to be taught to stu-
dents early because of their wide usefulness (e.g. [3], [4], [6]).

as a side remark, id like to  point  out  that  the  generalized
functions  defined  as  a  linear  functionals  on  test  functions  are
much more sensible candidates for the role of  arbitrary  func-
tions than the usual interpretation in terms of an arbitrary cor-
respondence  between  arguments  and  values.  any  constructive
mathematical object must  exist  in  the  form  of  approximations
expressible  via  finite  symbolic  sequences.  this  holds  true  for
continuous  functions  (approximations  via  linear  splines  with
rational nodes), and for generalized functions defined as linear
functionals    but  not  for  the  conventional  arbitrary  func-
tions. furthermore, if one obtains the value of a functions ar-
gument  from  some  measurements  involving  say  statistical  er-
rors,  then  all  one  can  directly  measure  is  an  average  of  the
function values  which is immediately interpreted as an inte-
gral  of  the  function  against  a  special  test  functions  which  de-
scribes the distribution of errors. thus generalized functions as
linear functionals directly correspond to the reality of physical
measurements of functional dependences.

from [7] one learns that bogolyubovs teacher and collabo-
rator of many years n.m. krylov was interested in generalized
solutions of differential equations, so a reasonable guess is that
bogolyubov  and  krylov  studied  sobolevs  ideas  soon  upon

publication. as a result, bogolyubov was heuristically prepared
to  accomplish  the  conceptual  breakthrough  in  regard  of  the
problem of uv divergences in the early 50s [8]  but was not
yet familiar with the smooth technique of distributions [2][5]
to make a systematic use of it in formal proofs.

in  a  remarkable  letter  [8],  bogolyubov  pointed  out  that  (i)
uv  divergences  result  from  an  incorrect  formal  treatment  of
products  of  singular  functions,  (ii)  such  products  are  not  de-
fined by  physical  principles  at  the  points  where  the  singulari-
ties overlap, and (iii) a correct way to define the amplitudes at
such singular points is via the procedure known as extension of
functionals  (which  is  a  basic  tool  of  functional  analysis,  the
simplest variant being the hahn-banach theorem). so,  ref.  [8]
shed  a  scientific  light  on  the  problem  of  uv  renormalization
and reduced it to a more or less straightforward working out of
the  formulas  and  proofs  for  what  became  known  as  the  r-
operation  [9].  however,  despite  the  distinctly  functional-
analytic flavor of the reasoning in [8], the formal proofs in [9]
were completely within the limits of the ordinary  integral  cal-
culus.  this  is  explained  by  the  fact  that  a  technique  for  han-
dling multidimensional distributions was not available then.

anyhow,  the  monograph  [10]  summarized  bogolyubovs
findings,  and  the  theoretical  community  was  presented  with
both  a  heuristic  distribution-theoretic  derivation  of  the  r-
operation, and a formal proof of the finiteness  of  the  result  in
terms of the conventional integral calculus. the sad fact is, the
derivation was almost universally ignored even by  mathemati-
cal physicists who ought to know better. an exception was the
work  of  epstein  and  glaser  [11]  who  attempted  to  formalize
bogolyubovs  construction  in  a  distribution-theoretic  manner,
but the essential mechanism which trivializes the formula and
the  finiteness  of  the  r-operation  was  not  clarified  and  re-
mained  buried  in  many  details  pertaining  to  the  operator  spe-
cifics of s-matrix, etc. ref.  [11]  remained  largely  unknown  to
the theoretical community.

on the other hand, the pro forma proof [9]  (of  no  heuristic
value  whatsoever)  received  considerable  attention.  it  was  cor-
rected by hepp [12], and improved via the forest formula [13]
(rediscovered  in  [14]).  the  works  [9],  [12][14]  created  what
became known as the bphz theory. it is commonly treated as
the  theory  of  uv  renormalization,  which  identification    i
emphasize  is incorrect because the bphz formalism ignores
the key ingredient of the discovery of r-operation, namely, the
distribution-theoretic argument of [8].

the heuristic arguments used to obtain breakthrough results
such  as  the  r-operation  are  unquestionably  more  important
than any artificial proof, and mathematical  physicists  ought  to
study and clarify such arguments in the first place. but this did
not happen in reality.

m al i z at i on   t o  d i f f e r e n t i at i on.  a  widely-spread  atti-
tude  is  that  uv  renormalization  is  an  artificial  procedure  on
top  of  ordinary  integrals,  a  temporary  prop,  and  it  will  go  as
soon  as  physicists  find  a  better  formalism  to  describe  the  do-
main  of  very  high  energies.  in  particular,  the  limit  l
 
(where l
 is the intermediate uv cutoff) is considered unphysi-
cal and in need of eventual modification.

 

however, such an attitude has only psychological roots in an
inadequate mathematical education. indeed, there is no princi-
ple which would restrict nature in her choice of mathematical
objects  in  terms  of  which  to  formulate  her  laws.  in  fact,  the
tremendous success of qed shouts at us  to  accept  the  objects
of  the  type  integral + subtractions  as  a  whole    i.e.  as  hy-
brid  objects  which  possess  features  of  both  ordinary  integrals
and generalized functions.

the reality is, the deeper we go, the more numerous and vari-
ous singular operations we encounter. from this viewpoint, the
popular  super  theories  that  attempt  to  eliminate  uv  renor-
malization altogether are as bizarre as would be an attempt to
eliminate  time  derivatives  from 
the  classical  mechanics
(imagine a theory with a superpartner for each planet, etc.)

in  short,  the  uv  renormalization  is  the  sweeping  of  dust
under the carpet  to  no  greater  extent  than  the  use  of  time  de-
rivatives in classical mechanics.

d i s t r i b u t i on s   t r i v i al i z e   t he   b ogol y u b ov-
p ar as y u k  t he or e m.     i already mentioned ref. [11] which
attempted  a  mathematical  clarification  of  bogolyubovs  con-
struction  of  pqft  together  with  the  r-operation.  however,  it
was limited in scope and addressed a  rather  specific  problem.
in a more systematic manner the problem had to be addressed
in  the  context  of  the  theory  of  asymptotic  operation  (ao)  to

which ill  turn  below  (a  review  of  the  first,  euclidean  part  of
the theory is given in [15]).

the  background  was  as  follows.  i  ran  across  the  textbook
[3] by chance in my second semester at the moscow state uni-
versity (1974), and read it because it is a highly  readable  col-
lection  of  specific  examples  with  the  irrelevant  abstract  parts
of the theory of distributions omitted. now it seems to me that
the  true  mathematical  physicists  who  later  pounced  me  on
the head with their anonymous reports, learn distributions from
the  real  book  [2]  which  is  entirely  devoted  to  the  abstract
theory without a single meaningful example. anyhow,  i  had  a
unique  opportunity  to  go  through  the  rest  of  my  curriculum
with a working knowledge of distributions, which proved to be
highly beneficial, and i emphatically agree with richtmeier [6]
on how distributions  should  be  taught  (if  what  i  learned  from
[3]  were  not  useful  id  forgot  it  long  ago  as  i  did  many  other
books  i  read  then).  by  the  time  i  took  the  course  of  quantum
field theory (1975) i had distributions in my bones. so i had no
trouble  with  grasping  the  meaning  of  local  uv  counterterms
and proceeded to develop a scenario for a distribution-theoretic
proof of the r-operation as a mnemonic tool which allowed me
to  skip  the  extremely  cumbersome  and  unilluminating  bphz
arguments. the scenario was formalized in [16]. unfortunately,
i learned about ref. [11] much later and so was  unable  to  em-
ploy  the  authority  of  epstein  and  glaser  as  a  (much  needed)
protection  against  inconscientious  referees  from  the  bphz
camp.

the  techniques  of  distributions  properly  extended  to  many
dimensions  allows  one  to  make  a  full  use  of  the  recursion
structure  of  the  problem  and  perform  proofs  inductively  with
respect to dimensionality of the manifolds on which singulari-
ties  are 
this  key  dilemma
(singularities  vs.  the  recursion  structure)  is  given  in  [15];
briefly speaking, the bphz method sacrifices  the  recursion  in
order to avoid distributions whereas  ao  develops  a  technique
to handle singularities in order to take full advantage of the re-
cursion structure to facilitate the reasoning.

localized.  a  discussion  of 

the importance of such a proof (which essentially trivializes
the  mechanism  of  finiteness  of  r-operation)  is  that    unlike
the bphz-style proofs  it is directly coupled to the heuristics
of the problem. i dont have space to explain technical details
and refer to the review [15] where an example is given, and to
a systematic formal exposition of [17].

one could argue that all one needs for practical purposes is
a  rule  for  subtractions  that  works,  and  whether  or  not  the
proofs  are  transparent  is  irrelevant.  unfortunately,  this  wont
work because there are far too many problems where one needs
to handle specific patterns of singularities (soft, collinear, mass
shell),  and  it  is  impossible  to  enumerate  and  memorize  all
possible cases and list all the corresponding rules. a more sen-
sible approach is to have a systematic rule to generate rules for
doing subtractions in specific situations. to ensure that results
are correct the method must so immediately translate into for-
mal proofs as to obviate them altogether.

from the distribution-theoretic viewpoint all such problems
follow the same general pattern: singularities are generated by
zeros  of  denominators;  intersections  of  the  corresponding  sin-
gular manifolds require special treatment; they are enumerated
in  a  straightforward  fashion  [the  subgraphs];  the  added  coun-
terterms  are  localized  on  those  manifolds  [such  a  manifold  is
described  by  a  system  of  equations  pi = 0  where  pi   are  the

corresponding  denominators,  and  the  counterterms  are  simply

was  involved  in  pqcd  calculations  and,  again,  when  con-
fronted with the  so-called  mass  singularities  was  quickly  able
to see (in the early 1981) the analogy with bogolyubovs 1952
argument:  a  formal  manipulation  (in  this  case,  a  mass  expan-
sion)  results  in  an  infinite  expression  (a  mass  singularity)  to
correct which one adds a counterterm localized at the point of
singularity, roughly like this:

the  new  element  here  compared  with  uv  divergences  is  the
requirement of  asymptotic  smallness  of  the  remainder,  which,
together  with  a  key  requirement  that  the  resulting  expansion
runs in pure powers and logarithms of the expansion parameter
[18], allows one to fix the finite part of c(m). coupled with the
techniques for handling products of singular factors, this led to:
(i) 
theoretical  results  that  the  bphz  experts  had  for  years
been struggling to obtain (short-distance expansion valid
for models with massless particles [18]);

(ii)  powerful  calculational  formulas  that  helped  define  state

of the art in the field [18], [19];

(iii)  extensions  (including  calculational  formulas)  to  the  en-
tire class of expansions of euclidean type [21] (including
mass expansions).

the formulas obtained  using  the  euclidean  ao  in  19841986
formed  a  basis  for  a  calculational  industry  (a  number  of  such
calculations have been used e.g. in the precision measurements
at lep1). of course, they were rewritten in the style of bphz
and subsequent references are made  to  those  secondary  publi-
cations.  the  objective  reason  was  that  in  euclidean  problems
such  as  ope  and  mass  expansions,  singular  distributions  ap-
pear  only  in  intermediate  formulas  and  can  be  integrated  out
from  the  final  answers.  (there  were  also  subjective  reasons
such as the lack of any formal mechanism in  the  international
research community to protect creative individuals from plagia-
rism by representatives of well-established mafias. watch [22]
for more on this.)

n on-e u c l i d e an   e x t e n s i on   of   ao.     by  1990,  with
all the results of the euclidean ao neatly appropriated by other
authors (see [23] for bibliographic comments), i had no choice
but to push forward in the non-euclidean direction. already in
1984  [20]  i  clearly  understood  both  the  fact  that  the  then  ob-
tained  formulas  were  limited  to  euclidean  problems  (not  that
there  is  a  shortage  of  physically  interesting  problems  of  this
kind; in fact, some my former colleagues seem to have chosen
to forever remain experts in this kind of calculations), as well
as the fact that the scheme of ao per se was in no way limited
to  euclidean  situations,  and  that  the  true  challenge  was  the
general  asymptotic  expansion  problem  for  pt  integrals  in
minkowski (non-euclidean) space. however, both my collabo-
rators  and  plagiarists  pooh-poohed  the  idea.  this  did  not  pre-
vent  me  from  participating  in  qcd  calculations  [24]  with  a
view  to  extend  the  method  of  ao  to  pqcd  problems  of  non-
euclidean  type.  i  realized  that  the  key  difference  from  the
euclidean  formulas  is  a  secondary  expansion  for  the  coun-
terterms  (the  homogenization)  needed  to  achieve  pure  power-
and-log dependence on the expansion parameters [25]. the last
step [26] was to realize that if one follows the routine of ao in
a  systematic  fashion,  no  special  rules  for  correct  scalings  etc.
are needed to do the power counting at the singularities local-

ized on non-linear manifolds: all one  has  to  do  is  perform  the
secondary expansion (the homogenization) in the sense of dis-
tributions (as is indeed warranted by the logic of the problem)
  with  all  the  corresponding  counterterms,  etc.  in  the  lan-
guage  of  ao,  the  difficulties  which,  say,  pqcd  experts  en-
countered  with  power  counting  at  mixed  soft-collinear  singu-
larities  are  due  to  the  fact  that  the  secondary  expansions,  if
done  formally,  may  result  in  non-integrable  singularities  to
which  the  routine  of  ao  has  to  be  applied  with  appropriate
(straightforward) modifications  but that is hard to see in the
context of the forest formula.

the result of [26] represents the much needed rule to gen-
erate  rules  for  doing  expansions  in  specific  non-euclidean
situations. needless to say that the truly  huge  physical  impor-
tance of the problem of  non-euclidean  expansions  and  a  huge
variety of specific problems creates an insurmountable tempta-
tion to devise a method of regions in order to rewrite the pre-
scriptions obtained via ao in the bphz style  exactly as was
done with the results of euclidean ao. fortunately, the method
of  non-euclidean  ao  is  applicable  to  problems  involving
phase-space d -functions (because for ao such d -functions are
not  really  different  from  ordinary  propagators),  and  so  distri-
butions cannot be eliminated from final answers thus defeating
any attempt to rewrite them bphz-style. an example of such a
problem  is  the  systematic  perturbation  theory  with  unstable
fundamental fields described in [27].

there is another line of research that  leads  to  distributions
from  another  direction:  the  so-called  algebraic  (a.k.a.  integra-
tion-by-parts) algorithms invented in [28] have by now become
an indispensable tool for automated large-scale calculations of
multiloop  integrals  [29].  a  recent  extension  to  loop  integrals
with  arbitrary  topologies  and  mass  patterns  [30]  relies  on  re-
sults  of  the  theory  of  singularities  of  differentiable  mappings
[31], and there is a connection with the homogenization proce-
dure of the non-euclidean ao [26]. but ive run out of space.
watch [22] for more.
