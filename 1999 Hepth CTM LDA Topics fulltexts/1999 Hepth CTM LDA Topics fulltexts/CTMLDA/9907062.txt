(1.1) hypersurface l question generated one four null congruences orthogonal b, non-positive expansion direction away b. matter elds theory required satisfy dominant energy condition. covariant entropy conjecture motivated proposed holographic principle hooft susskind , recent work attempts generalize principle cosmological backgrounds {$9806039$}. note, point number diculties proposal. begin noting choice units fundamental constants satisfy h = c = g = k = 1. appropriate factors g h restored bound becomes a/(4hg), see bound becomes trivial classical limit, xed gravitational interactions. bound hold all, must hold full theory quantum gravity coupled matter. however, well-known, dominant energy condition (and also weak energy condition) fails even free quantum elds. one consequence dominant energy condition local energy density appears positive denite. one computes expectation value normal-ordered energy momentum tensor h|t|i free scalar eld theory, state admixture ground state two-particle state, interference terms expectation value lead negative values energy density. stands therefore, conjecture inconsistent. one insists taking classical limit, bound becomes trivial. soon one goes quantum theory, conditions bound hold violated, except possibly theory matter content. one reason imposing dominant energy condition rule possibility superluminal entropy ow, would allow easy violations bound, see moment. addition, one wants rule creating large amounts entropy little energy, simultaneously creating matter positive negative energy density. course one could try replace dominant energy condition weaker constraint. however following example illustrates diculties bound independent condition. consider black hole equilibrium thermal radiation temperature hawking temperature. discussed {$9905177$}, one take b event horizon 1 singularity hawking radiation l r=0 thermal radiation b fig. 1: penrose diagram black hole. b surface event horizon. l light-like hypersurface zero expansion, bounded b. time, construct hypersurface l using future-directed outgoing null generators, shown g. 1. since black holes evaporation supported ingoing thermal radiation, geometry near horizon static. one therefore innite amount time send constant ux entropy across hypersurface l, violation bound. precise, dene entropy crossing l proper entropy ux, integrated l. problem independent matter content theory (and hence energy conditions one might choose impose), since even pure gravity, quantum black hole hawking radiate gravitons. note also large black hole geometry caustics need force hypersurface l approach singularity. interesting consider example consistent generalized second law black hole thermodynamics. true black hole absorbs innite amount entropy time goes innity, emits equal (or larger) amount entropy form hawking radiation, accord second law. however entropy emitted cannot cross hypersurface l causal way. wavelength hawking particles order size black hole. best thought originating outside black hole, order schwarzschild radius event horizon. hawking particles contribute proper entropy passing l, since undetectable freely falling observer crosses horizon. 2 arbitrarily large amount entropy cross hypersurface l, one regard log number internal states black hole a/4? analyze question scenario resolution black hole information problem discussed {$9905177$}. roughly speaking, picture information crosses horizon completely causal manner, eectively transferred hawking radiation non-local way hits singularity. thus indeed super-luminal propagation entropy picture. component entropy contribute local entropy ux passing l. although arbitrarily large amount entropy cross l, low-energy observer inside black hole could never detect entropy a/4. order observer inside live long detect entropy a/4 would undergo trans-planckian acceleration order em 2 . one sees via similar gedanken experiments ones considered {$9905177$}. likewise observer entering horizon late times see entropy already hit singularity, preserving bound number observable internal states. singularity l b r=0 fig. 2: penrose diagram collapsing spherical dust cloud. l light-like hypersurface intersects dust cloud. order avoid caustics, l deformed lie along dotted line. presented perhaps clearest counterexample bound (1.1), consider number objections arguments bousso presents evidence bound. consider collapsing dust cloud, construct hypersurface l indicated 3 g. 2, intersects whole dust cloud. boussos claim caustics force l take circuitous route singularity, way surface l intersect whole dust cloud, preserving bound (1.1). relies fact highly entropic system never spherically symmetric many caustics present. simply point semiclassical approximation, one requires expectation value energy momentum tensor spherically symmetric avoid caustics. provide signicant constraint entropy congurations. beyond semiclassical approximation, null convergence condition hold, caustics need form rst place. furthermore, since construction surface l formulated terms classical geometric quantities, clear boussos construction carries full quantum theory. much evidence bousso presents bound involves showing consistency bekensteins conjectured bound {$9905177$} 2er , (1.2) number dierent examples. e total energy system, r circumferential radius, dened r = pa/4 area smallest sphere surrounding system. bound much discussed since original proposal {$9905177$}. bound appears hold large systems, provided number matter species small {$9905177$}. easily violated suciently small systems (for example free scalar eld case already mentioned), large number matter species {$9905177$}, systems suciently low temperature. likewise, one take large number copies small system, make large system violates (1.2). general, generalized second law {$9905177$} imply bound (1.2) {$9905177$}. special systems (1.2) violated used construct counterexamples covariant entropy bound. instance consider normal region (i.e. trapped anti-trapped) friedmann-robertson-walker cosmology, discussed {$9905177$}. covariant entropy bound implies entropy spatial hypersurface inside apparent horizon radius rah, satisfy r2 ah. follows bound (1.2) region treated bekenstein system {$9905177$}. thus bound (1.1) potentially violated systems violate (1.2). simplest example system gas n species free particles box size r energy e. entropy gas diverge log n . one cannot use fact constrain value n , simply means bound (1.1) universal bound system matter coupled gravity. 4 2. conclusions noted number diculties current formulation covariant entropy conjecture. propose general backgrounds, unexpected entropy bounds arise demanding validity generalized second law, suggested {$9902088$}. law passed number highly nontrivial consistency checks {$9905177$}. however whether second law gives rise holographic style bounds system dependent. constrain entropy density early universe, nal phase recollapsing universe. however isolated system collapse black hole, second law implies entropy satises a/4. acknowledgments thank richard easther, sanjaye ramgoolam marolf helpful discussions. research d.l. supported part doe grant de-fe0291er40688-task a. 5
