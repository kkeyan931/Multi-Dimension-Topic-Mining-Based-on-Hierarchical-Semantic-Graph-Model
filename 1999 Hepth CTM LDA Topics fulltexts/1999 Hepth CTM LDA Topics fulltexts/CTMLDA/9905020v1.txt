the superconformal group of n = 4 super-yang-mills has two types of operator

representations: short and long. we conjecture that operator product expansions for

which at least two of the three operators are short exactly respect a bonus u (1)y r-
symmetry, which acts as an automorphism of the superconformal group. this conjecture

is for arbitrary gauge group g and gauge coupling gy m . a consequence is that n  4-
point functions involving only short operators exactly respect the u (1)y symmetry, as
has been previously conjectured based on ads duality. this, in turn, would imply that

all n  3-point functions involving only short operators are not renormalized, as has

also been previously conjectured and subjected to perturbative checks. it is argued that

instantons are compatible with our conjecture. some perturbative checks of the conjecture

are presented and sl(2, z) modular transformation properties are discussed.

1. introduction

the central objects which characterize conformal eld theories in any dimension are

the spectrum of operator dimensions and the operator product expansion (ope) coe-

cients. these objects control the behavior of operator correlation functions, which are the

observables of conformal eld theories. over the past several years, it has been appreciated

that four dimensional gauge theories with enough matter generically lead to interacting

conformal eld theories, and it is an interesting avenue in eld theory to consider correla-

tion functions in any of these theories.

this avenue has not been much explored until recently, in the context of the maxi-

mally supersymmetric 4d conformal eld theory, n = 4 super-yang-mills. the motivation

behind the recent work is the conjectured duality of [1-3] to gravity in anti-de sitter space.

there have been recent studies, from both the n = 4 eld theory and ads gravity dual

perspectives, of various n-point functions; see, e.g. [2-11] and references cited therein.

we will here conjecture that the ope coecients of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills

exactly obey certain selection rules. as will be discussed, a motivation for this conjecture

comes from the conjectured ads duality. nevertheless, our conjecture itself is purely a

statement about the n = 4 eld theory, and thus logically separate from the ads duality

conjecture;

it should be possible to prove or disprove it purely in the context of eld

theory. indeed, we believe that our conjecture is correct for n = 4 super-yang-mills with

arbitrary gauge group g. unfortunately, we have not been able to prove the conjecture,

so we will here only be able to present its motivation and some checks within the context

of instantons and perturbative n = 4 eld theory.

as reviewed in the next section, operators form representations of the n = 4 supercon-

formal group, which has two types of representations: the generic long representations,

and the special short representations. the short representations are the generalizations

of chiral superelds and analogs of bps states and satisfy special properties thanks to

supersymmetry; for example, their dimensions are not renormalized. it is the short rep-

resentations which are seen as single particle states in the ads supergravity dual. all

operators in a short representation will be referred to as short operators, while those in

a long representation will be referred to as long operators.

as emphasized in [12], the n = 4 superconformal algebra admits a bonus u (1)y
(see also

symmetry, which acts on the supersymmetry generators as an r-symmetry.

[13,14] for earlier discussions of u (1)y .) although u (1)y is not a symmetry of the eld

1

theory, all operators can be assigned a denite u (1)y charge and, based on the ads duality,

it was conjectured in [12] that all correlation functions of short operators, for g = su (n )

(and also so(n ), sp(n ), and theories with less susy obtained by orbifolds) approximately
respect a u (1)y conservation selection rule in the double limit where g2
g2
y m n  1, where the supergravity dual is weakly coupled.

y m n  1 and

it was further conjectured in [12] that the u (1)y selection rule is actually exact for
correlation functions of n  4 short operators1. we believe that this statement applies for

n = 4 with arbitrary gauge group g and gauge coupling gy m . on the other hand, it is
known that the u (1)y selection rule is denitely violated for general n  5 point functions

of short operators.

the above conjecture, that a selection rule is exact for n  4 point functions of

operators, but generally violated for n  5 point functions, prompts the question: why

should n  4 point functions be so dierent from n  5 point functions? in fact, we point

out that there is indeed a natural dierence between n  4 and n  5 within the context

of the ope; this is the motivation for our conjecture. the statement of our conjecture is

that the ope coecients involving either three short operators (sss) or two short and

one long operator (ssl) exactly respect the u (1)y symmetry. on the other hand, ope

coecients involving more than one long operator (sll or lll) generally violate the

u (1)y symmetry. as we discuss, this conjecture has as a consequence that the u (1)y
symmetry is exact for n  4 point functions but violated for n  5 point functions of short

operators. the exact u (1)y selection rule for n  4 point functions, in turn, implies [12]

the non-renormalization of 3-point functions of short operators which was conjectured in

[5] and checked in the weakly coupled eld theory limit to leading order in perturbation

theory in [6].

an outline of this paper is as follows. in the next section, we review the representation

theory of the n = 4 superconformal group and its u (1)y outer automorphism. in sect. 3,

we discuss the ope and the motivation for our conjecture. in sect. 4 we discuss how the

supercharges act on gauge-invariant, composite, operators and demonstrate in perturbation

1 generally, there can be contact term contributions to correlation functions, involving delta
functions which vanish unless operators are at the same point, which violate these selection rules.
for example, in n = 4 supersymmetric u (1) gauge theory we have hf(x)f (y)i  4(x  y),
where the contact term violates the selection rule by 4 units. we will always take the operator

insertion points to be separated and thus ignore contact terms.

2

theory that it can be necessary to include quantum corrections to descendent operators in

the case of long representations of the superconformal group.

in sect. 5, we discuss instanton contributions to operator correlation functions. we

present a heuristic argument for a simple relation between the u (1)y charge of an opera-

tor and how many of the 16 exact fermion zero modes which it contains. since instantons

contribute to correlation functions only if the operators saturate all 16 of the exact fermion

zero modes, the relation we present leads to selection rules for when instantons can con-

tribute to correlation functions. for an n-point function of all short operators, instantons

or anti-instantons can contribute only if |qt | = 4(n  4), where qt is the net u (1)y charge
violation. this is nicely consistent with the conjectured non-renormalization of n  3 point

functions [5,6], and the conjecture [12] that the u (1)y selection rule is exact for n = 4-

point functions. for correlation functions of two short and one long operator, we argue

that instantons can contribute only if qt = 0, which is compatible with our conjecture
that three-point functions with two short and one long operator exactly vanish if qt 6= 0.

finally, for correlation functions of two long operators we argue that instantons only con-

tribute if qt = 0, which is compatible with our argument that all two-point functions of

either short or long operators exactly respect the u (1)y selection rule.

sect. 6 presents a non-trivial, perturbative eld theory check of the conjecture [12]

that n  4 point functions of short operators respect the u (1)y ; leading order radiative

corrections which could have violated u (1)y miraculously sum to zero, much as in the

3-point functions analyzed in [6]. this result applies for any gauge group g.

in sect. 7 we discuss perturbative eld theory checks of our ope conjecture involving

two short and one long operator. in a variety of examples, we verify that leading contri-

butions to correlation functions which would violate our conjectured selection rule indeed

sum to zero. in many cases, this vanishing is a simple consequence of a sum over color
indices a, b of the form f abcd(ab);ci, which vanishes because f abc is antisymmetric in [ab]
while d(ab);ci is symmetric. in many other cases, the required vanishing of leading order
radiative corrections is much more dicult to verify and it was beyond our patience to

complete the task. we also present an example where the quantum correction found in

sect. 4 for a long descendent is precisely correct to ensure that a possible violation to our

selection rule is indeed canceled. on the whole, we nd our checks presented in sect. 7 to

be somewhat disappointing in that we did not nd many tractable examples with the sorts

of miraculous cancellations found in [6] and our sect. 6. on the other hand, at least all

3

tractable examples are indeed consistent with our conjectured ope selection rule, even if

the vanishing is not so impressive.

finally, in sect. 8, we make some comments regarding sl(2, z) s-duality, the ope,

and our conjectures.

of course, as with the conjectured non-renormalization of 3-point functions of short

operators [5,6], instantons and leading order perturbative checks can provide some con-

dence that conjectured exact statements are indeed correct, but they are no substitute for

a proof. it is quite possible that our conjecture concerning the ope can actually be proven

by making full use of the powerful constraints of the n = 4 superconformal ward identi-

ties. indeed, because all superconformal primary operators are neutral under u (1)y , the

non-trivial content of our conjecture is a statement regarding correlation functions involv-

ing superconformal descendents. if, as naively expected (but it is not at all obvious if its

true), all superconformal descendent correlation can be obtained via ward identities from

correlation functions involving only superconformal primary operators, it must be possible

to prove or disprove our conjecture directly via superconformal ward identities. we have
not yet found such a direct proof and leave this as a problem for future investigation2.

as mentioned above, we believe that our conjecture applies exactly for n = 4 with

any gauge group g. this is in line with the expectation that it is actually a consequence of

supersymmetric ward-identities. if true, this implies that the exact u (1)y selection rule

for n  4 point functions and the non-renormalization of n  3 point functions of short

operators also apply for arbitrary gauge group g and gauge coupling gy m . it is indeed

possible to verify that the cancellations of radiative corrections found in [6] in the context

of g = su (n ) occur for arbitrary gauge group g: the only group theory identity needed
in [6] was [[t a, t p], t p] = n t a, which is a statement about the quadratic casimir and
generalizes to arbitrary group g as [[t a, t p], t p] = c2(g)t a, with c2(g) the quadratic
casimir of the adjoint representation.

2 the n = 4 harmonic superspace formalism of [15] is designed to eciently make use of the
superconformal ward identities. however, we are presently wary of this formalism as it is purely

on-shell and was shown in [12] to lead to the incorrect conclusion that all n-point functions of

short operators exactly respect the u (1)y selection rule, for all n. (see also [16].) as pointed out

in [12], it is possible that the formalism can be salvaged by nding some missing superconformal

invariants which violate u (1)y , though this remains to be seen. in any case, it does not seem well

suited for including operators in long representations.

4

2. n = 4 superconformal reps. and the u (1)y bonus symmetry

the 4d n = 4 superconformal group p su (2, 2|4) has two types of representations,

which we refer to as short and long. all representations are generated by a primary

m

op , and their conformal descendents. here n

operator op , along with descendent operators, related to op by supersymmetry, of the
form n
op denotes a nested graded
commutators with the sixteen supercharges qi
 and qi, , e.g. 2op  [q, {q, [q, op ]}].
(the remaining 16 superconformal supercharges act as lowering operators.) for the generic,
long, representation, the operators n
statistics. all of the operators n

op truncate at n  8 and m  8 by fermi
op in the long multiplet are referred to as long

m

m

m

operators.

the short representations have the dening property that they instead truncate at

n  4 and m  4; they are the analog of bps objects of superconformal eld theories.

it turns out that such representations are completely characterized by an integer p 

0. in particular, the dimensions of such operators are xed in terms of p and thus not

renormalized. the spectrum of short representations was found in [13] and their table

can also be found reproduced in [12]. the primary operators which generates the short
representations are op  [trg(p)](0,p,0), where  is the n = 4 scalar in the adjoint of
the gauge group g and the 6 = (0, 1, 0) of the su (4)r global symmetry and (0, p, 0) are

the dynkin labels of the su (4)r representation. there are rank(g) independent short

representations (in addition to the identity), labeled by p which are the degrees of the
independent casimirs of g. we refer to all operators n

op in short representation

m

multiplets as short operators.

a simple example of a long representation primary operator is the su (4)r singlet
ok  [trg(2)](0,0,0). as discussed in [17], the multiplet of long operators associated with
ok includes the konishi current, which is discussed extensively in [18]. more generally,
we can obtain long, primary operators as [trg(r+2s)](0,r,0) via taking a completely sym-
metric combination of the s and then taking any number s > 0 traces. operators which

are not completely symmetric in the s are descendents since, in n = 1 susy notation,

2

i



d

= gijk[j, k], where (

i

) i are n = 1 (anti) chiral superelds and i = 1, 2, 3.

other examples of long representations are multi-trace operators, with more than a single

trace over the gauge indices.

in [12] it was emphasized that p su (2, 2|4), admits an outer automorphism u (1)y ,
which acts as an r symmetry, under which the supercharges transform with charge 1.

5

the u (1)y charge assignment of the short representations was determined in the original
analysis of [13] in the context of the 5d, n = 8, ads5 supergravity which is dual [1-3]
to the 4d n = 4 eld theory. in terms of the eld theory, all operators can be assigned
denite charges under u (1)y ; we write each operator as o(qi)
, indicating the u (1)y charge
qi. the charge assignment is determined as follows [13,12]: the adjoint scalar  of n = 4
is assigned charge zero, while the supercharges qi
 and q ,i are assigned charges 1
and +1, respectively. thus all primary representations op (x), whether for a short or a
long multiplet, which have the form of a trace or traces of symmetrized powers of , are
assigned charge zero. the superconformal descendents of the form n
op have u (1)y
charge m  n. all operators in short representations thus have u (1)y charges |q|  4,
while all operators in long representations have charges |q|  8.

m

i

u (1)y is generally not a symmetry of the n = 4 eld theory. nevertheless, it was
argued in [12] (see also [14]) that u (1)y is an approximate bonus symmetry of general
correlation functions of small representation operators in an appropriate limit (g2
y m n  1
with also g2
it was further conjectured to be an exact (i.e. valid for all
gauge groups and all gy m ) symmetry of all n  4 point functions of operators in small
representations. the argument of [12] relied on the ads duality: u (1)y is an approximate
symmetry of iib string theory in its classical supergravity limit. however, by arguments

y m n  1).

similar to those of [19], it was suggested in [12] that the stringy and quantum corrections
to supergravity, which generally violate u (1)y , in fact vanish for all n  4 point functions
of short operators. while u (1)y is conjectured to be an exact symmetry of n  4 point
functions, it denitely can not be an exact symmetry of general n  5 point functions of

operators in small representations. this is seen directly [10-12] both in the eld theory, as

will be reviewed below, and via the ads duality.

3. bonus symmetry and the ope

our interest is in characterizing the extent to which the operator product expansions

respect the u (1)y bonus symmetry. we will show that the ope is indeed compatible
with u (1)y being an exact symmetry of n  4 point functions of operators in short
representations, but generally violated for n  5 point functions.

we will be interested in operator product expansions of the general form (for simplicity

we write expressions for scalar operators)

with some ope coecients ck

ij which can in general depend on the choice of gauge group
g, the gauge coupling gy m , and y m . the ope coecients appearing in (3.1) also appear
in the three-point functions

(3.2)

(3.3)

which, by conformal invariance, satises ij = 0 unless i = j.

any of the operators appearing in (3.1), (3.2), and (3.3) can be either of short or long

type. unless indicated otherwise, the indices i, j, and k above run over all operators of

both types. when we want to restrict attention to an operator of a given type, we use
superscripts to denote the type, e.g. c(sss)
over short operators, c(ssl)

when i, j, and k are each taken to run only

ijk

ijk

when i and j are short but k is long, etc.

consider rst the metric (3.3). the correlation function is non-zero only if the op-

erators oi and oj have the same anomalous dimension, conjugate so(4) lorentz spins,
and conjugate su (4)r representations. these requirements prohibit a non-zero two-point
function with one operator in a short representation and the other in a long representation,

(sl)
ij = 0.

(3.4)

the reason is that operators are in a short representation if and only if their dimensions are

correlated with their su (4)r transformation properties; if oi is such a short representation
and oj must have the same dimension and conjugate su (4)r representation as oi, then
oj must also be in a short representation. it was proven in [12] that the two-point function
of operators in short representations exactly obey the u (1)y selection rule. the argument
of [12] did not rely on the operators being in short representations and we expect that the

selection rule applies for long representations as well:

ij = 0 and ll
ss

ij = 0 unless

qi + qj = 0.

(3.5)

in short, the metric ij exactly respects the u (1)y selection rule for all operators.

we now consider three point functions and u (1)y bonus symmetry. there are gener-
ally non-zero three-point functions involving any combinations of short and long operators:

involving at least two short representations exactly respect the u (1)y selection rule:

on the other hand, as discussed below, we know that there are

some c(lls)

ijk

6= 0 with qi + qj + qk 6= 0;

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

i.e. the case (lls) of two longs and a short generally does not respect the u (1)y selection
rule. similarly, the case (lll) of three longs is generally not expected to obey the u (1)y
selection rule.



, corresponding to changing the gauge coupling  = y m

as emphasized in [12] there is a special short representation operator: the exactly
marginal operator o(4)
y m ;
as indicated, this operator carries u (1)y charge q = 4. there is a conjugate operator
o(4)
 , corresponding to changing  . the metric   6= 0 (its proportional to |g|) and
  =   = 0 thanks to (3.5). the variation of a general n-point correlation function
with respect to the gauge coupling  is given in terms of the n + 1-point function with an

(3.9)

note that the correlation function on the left side has total u (1)y charge pn
that on the right side has total u (1)y charge 4 +pn

i=1 qi, while
i=1 qi. if both sides were required
to respect the u (1)y selection rule, both sides would have to vanish: the n-point function
would be independent of  for all   i.e. be not renormalized.

a consequence of the u (1)y selection rule for two-point and three-point functions
involving all short operators is thus that two-point functions of operators in short repre-

sentations are not renormalized. its known that the dimensions of short representations
can not be renormalized, so the content of this statement is that the metric (ss)
is also not renormalized, i.e.

it is independent of gy m and y m . this agrees with the

in (3.3)

ij

vanishing of the leading order, radiative corrections found in [6].

the reason why we know that the u (1)y selection rule must be violated for general
(3.8) is that we know that operators in long representations generally do receive

c(lls)

ijk

8

quantum corrections to their anomalous dimensions. for example, as shown in [18], the
konishi current j 

k, which is a descendent of the long primary operator ok mentioned
above, gets a non-zero radiative correction to its anomalous dimension. the operator ok
and the current j 
k(y)i 6= 0, (3.9) gives
ho(4)
k(x)j 

k both carry u (1)y charge zero. since  hj 
k(y)i 6= 0, which is a c(sll)

which violates the u (1)y selection rule.

k(x)j 

ijk

(z)j 



as shown in [18], the operator product expansion of two stress tensors, which are

short operators, includes the konishi current, which is a long operator. since the stress

tensor and the konishi current both have vanishing u (1)y charge, this is compatible with
our conjecture that all non-zero c(ssl)

exactly respect the u (1)y selection rule.

ijk

consider now four-point functions of operators in short representations. we assume

that there is an expansion of the four point function in terms of the opes of the form

h

4yi=1

oi(xi)(qi)i =xj

c(ssx) j

12

c(xss)

j34

f{i};j(xi),

(3.10)

where x denotes that j should be summed over all representations, both short and long,

and we will not be concerned with the form of the functions f{i};j(xi). a consequence of

(3.6), (3.7), and (3.5) is that the right side of (3.10) exactly vanishes unless the charges

of the operators satisfy the u (1)y selection rule. our ope conjectures thus implies the

conjecture of [12] that, for a general 4-point function of operators in short representations,

h

4yi=1

o(qi)

i

(xi)i = 0 unless

4xi=1

qi = 0.

(3.11)

a consequence of this exact selection rule for 4-point functions is that all three-point

functions of operators in short representations are not renormalized, as explained above;
i.e. the c(sss)

are constants, independent of gy m and y m .

ijk

we now turn to ve-point functions of operators in short representations. again,

assuming that an ope expansion is valid, these will be of the form

h

5yi=1

o(qi)

i

(xi)i =xj,k

c(ssx) j

12

c(xsy ) k

j3

c(y ss)

k45 f{i};j;k(xi).

(3.12)

unlike the above case of four-point functions, the ope for two longs and a short represen-
tation enters as c(lsl) k

in the expansion (3.12). because these ope violate the u (1)y

j3

9

selection rule, the 5-point function (3.12) of short representations does not satisfy an exact

selection rule, i.e. it is generally possible to have

h

5yi=1

o(qi)

i

(xi)i 6= 0 with

5xi=1

qi 6= 0.

(3.13)

this situation clearly generalizes for higher n  5 point functions.

the violations (3.13) of u (1)y for n  5 point functions can be seen in the context
of the eld theory, for example in instanton contributions to correlation functions [10,11].

instantons will be discussed further in sect. 5. there are also contributions to (3.13)

which violate the u (1)y for n  5 point functions which are visible in perturbation theory.
for example, the perturbative renormalization of 4-point functions demonstrated in [7,8]

implies via (3.9) a perturbative violation of the u (1)y selection rule for the 5-point function
with an additional insertion of o(4)
. violations of u (1)y for n  5 point functions is
also compatible with ads duality, where it is associated with the stringy corrections to



supergravity.

4. the form of descendent operators

because superconformal primary operators are neutral under u (1)y , the non-trivial
content of the u (1)y selection rule conjectures is for correlation functions involving at least
one superconformal descendent operator. it is thus important to determine the correct form
of the descendent operators n
n = 4 yang-mills theory are given by

op . the on-shell supersymmetry transformations of the

there are similar transformations for

 and f  , and we have left out numerical constants
for simplicity. the variations under the other 16 superconformal supersymmetries si and

for i  in (4.1), but we will not need these transformations here, as it is the action of qi

and qi  which generate descendents.

i
 can also be easily written, roughly by simply replacing 

i by 

10

the issue now is how the supersymmetry generators qi

 and qi  act on the gauge
invariant operators, which are traces of products of the elds in (4.1). classically this given

simply by the acting with the transformations in (4.1) on each of the elds in the operator.

for example, classical expressions for some of the descendents of the short primary operator
o2 = [trg(2)](0,2,0) are

operator

o2 = tr(2ij k + kj i  ki j)
2o2 = tr(ij  + g[ik , jl]kl)

(4.2)

(irrelevant overall normalization factors are suppressed.) likewise, classical expressions
for some of the descendents of the long operator ok = trg(ij ij ) are

operator

ok = tr(ij j )

2ok = tr(g[ik, jl]kl)

2ok = tr(ij f + 2i()j )

(4.3)

generally, however, we must expect that the superconformal generators have quan-

tum corrections when acting on gauge invariant composite operators. for example, the
dilatation generator d, which acts on primary operators as d = (i)x +, clearly gets
quantum contributions when acting on composite operators because , which gives the di-
mension of the operator, gets quantum contributions. because d appears in {qi

i }, the
action of the supersymmetry generators on composite operators clearly must also generally

, s

have additional quantum contributions.

because the short operators do not have quantum corrections to their operator di-

mensions, it is also natural to expect that the classical expressions for their operator

descendents are, in fact, exact. this is compatible with (3.5) and ward identities such as

that discussed in [12] applied to 2-point functions. on the other hand, we should generally

expect that descendents of long operators, such as (4.3), do receive quantum corrections.

indeed, this is the resolution to the following puzzle:

4.1. a puzzle and comments about operator mixings

consider the two-point function

h(2o2)(x)(2ok )(y)i,

(4.4)

11

involving the lorentz spin (0, 0) operators in the (0, 0, 2) and (2, 0, 0) of su (4)r, respec-

tively; the rst operator is given in the second line in (4.2), while the classical expression

for the second operator is given in the second line in (4.3).

if this two-point function

were non-zero, it would violate the u (1)y selection rule; however, as indicated generally
in (3.4), (4.4) must vanish. this follows from the conformal group because 2o2 is a con-
formal primary with exact dimension  = 3, while 2ok classically has dimension 3 but
gets non-zero quantum corrections, corresponding to the non-zero anomalous dimension

of ok . since, for general non-zero gy m , the two operators have dierent dimensions, the

conformal group requires that the two-point function vanishes. indeed, the only operator
which can have a non-zero two-point function with 2o2 is the conjugate short operator
2


o2, for which

h(2o2)(x)(

2

o2)(y)i = 

2|g|

(2)4|x  y|6 ;

(4.5)

the result (4.5) is known to be exact since it is related by supersymmetry to a non-

renormalized current two-point function.

however, using the expressions in the second lines in (4.2) and (4.3), we nd a non-zero

result for (4.4) at order g2

y m coming from:

h(gy m 3)ij (x)(gy m 3)ij (y)i = c2(g)|g|g2

y m

1

(2)6|x  y|6 + o(g4

y m ),

(4.6)

where c2(g) is the quadratic casimir of gauge group g, normalized to be n for su (n ),
and the factor of c2(g)|g| comes from f abcfabc.

the resolution to this apparent puzzle is that there must be a quantum correction to

the second line in (4.3) which compensates for (4.6), preserving the vanishing of (4.4). to
order g2

y m , we must have

2ok  lij = tr(gy m [ik , jl]kl) + 1

correction term in (4.7) cancels the contribution to (4.4) from (4.6). at higher orders in

o2 is the conjugate operator to 2o2 in (4.5). using (4.5), the g2

= 

gy m there can be additional quantum corrections to (4.7).

finally, we would like to comment on the issue of operator mixing. generally long

primary operators need not be pure primaries, in the sense that they need not be eigen-

vectors of the anomalous dimensions matrix, which arises in the ope with the dilatation

12

operator d. it is the eigenvectors of this anomalous dimension matrix, with diering eigen-

values, which are orthogonal in that their two-point functions vanish. operators which are

not eigenvectors have non-zero two-point function mixings among themselves; diagonaliz-

ing the two-point functions is a practical way to obtain the pure primary eigenvectors.

one might thus be tempted to interpret the above puzzle dierently: rather than

correcting the action of  as in (4.7) to make (4.4) vanish, perhaps (4.4) is actually non-
zero and simply expresses that 2ok is not an eigenvector of the anomalous dimension
matrix but, instead, mixes with other operators such as s
? this latter interpretation

ij

requires that

hok (x)o(4)



(y)i

(4.8)

is also non-zero, as (4.8) is related to (4.4) by supersymmetry. the interpretation of
the non-zero result for (4.8) would, similarly, be that ok = tr(ij ij ) itself is not a
pure primary operator but mixes with other operators, including the operator o(4)
 , in
other words, this interpretation would require that ok is actually superposition ok =

eok + cg2

dimension matrix.
(const.)g2

y m o(4)

 + . . ., where eok and the other terms are eigenvectors of the anomalous

if this were the case, the 2-point function (4.8) would be given by
y m /|x  y|8. however, it is easily seen that this can not happen in perturbation
theory: because (4.8) has classical scaling dimension 6, perturbation theory can only lead to
terms scaling as 1/|xy|6 up to additional perturbative corrections depending on log(xy).
resumming the logs can lead to perturbative expressions such as f (g)/|x  y|6+o(g2
y m ),
but we do not expect to be able to get the 1/|x  y|8 dependence above in perturbation

theory. briey put: we expect that, in perturbation theory, there can be operator mixing

only among operators with the same classical scaling dimensions.

since there is no other su (4) singlet with classical scaling dimension 2, we do not

expect that the above ok can have any operator mixing in perturbation theory and, in

particular, (4.8) must vanish in perturbation theory. consequently, we believe that (4.4)

really must vanish and the correct interpretation of the above puzzle is the one given above:

that the action of  on long operators such as ok gets quantum corrections.

by this same argument, we expect that the perturbative quantum corrections to the

action of the supersymmetry generators on long operators must also respect the classical
scaling dimensions of operators. for example, 2ok has classical scaling dimension 3 so
there can be a quantum correction in perturbation theory by an operator in the same

su (4)r representation which also has classical scaling dimension 3; this is compatible

13

with (4.7). consider, on the other hand, ok , which is in the 4 of su (4)r, with lorentz
spin ( 1
2 , 0) and classical scaling dimension 5/2. because there is no other operator with
the same classical scaling dimension and lorentz and su (4)r representations, we do not
expect to nd a quantum correction to ok in perturbation theory. thus, for example,
we expect that

h(ok)(x)(3o2)(y)i = 0

(4.9)

in perturbation theory, though we have not completed the task of explicitly verifying this.

o2, in which case
again, the only way (4.9) could be non-zero is if ok mixes with 
(4.9) would be proportional to 1/|x  y|7  but in perturbation theory (4.9) would go as
1/|x  y|6 up to gy m corrections in log(x  y).

5. comments on instanton contributions to correlation functions

an instanton of n = 4 super yang-mills, with arbitrary gauge group g, has 8c2(g)
fermion zero modes, where c2(g) is the casimir of the adjoint representation, normalized
to be n for su (n ). more generally, an instanton number k conguration has 8kc2(g)
fermion zero modes. of these fermion zero modes, 16 are special: they are 8 zero modes
generated by acting on the instanton conguration with the 8 supercharges qi
, and 8 gen-
i
. the remaining 16 supercharges annihilate
the instanton (they generate the 16 fermion zero modes of the anti-instanton). we will

erated by the superconformal supercharges s

denote these 16 special zero modes by (x) and the remaining (8kc2(g)  16) zero modes
by (x).

the 16  are exact zero modes, while the  can generally be lifted. in particular,

at the origin of the moduli space of vacua, which is the vacuum of interest for conformal

invariance, the  zero modes can be lifted in multiples of 4 by a term in the instanton
action sinst = . . . + 4; this is discussed in [11] and references therein. an instanton
contributes to a correlation function only if the 16 zero modes  are soaked up by the

operators involved in a correlation function.

the general procedure is to replace every operator in the correlation function with
its instanton background version, oi  oinst
by the prescription   inst,   inst
and f  f inst, where inst, inst, and f inst are the adjoint scalars, fermions, and self-

i

dual eld strength solutions in the instanton backgrounds. expressions for these solutions

for the general su (n ) instanton background are quite complicated and can be found in

[11]. (this uses the adhm construction, which is not known for exceptional groups.)

14

the instanton can then contribute to hqi oii if all 16 fermion zero modes  appear in
qi oinst

. if the 16  zero modes are indeed soaked up, it will always be possible to soak

i

up the remaining  zero modes by bringing down powers of sinst. we can thus just focus
on the  zero modes.

we will give a heuristic argument for a relation between the u (1)y charge of an
operator and how many  fermion zero modes it contains. consider the supersymmetry
relations (4.1) in an instanton background, where we replace f  f inst. the solution inst
satisfying inst = f inst is inst = finst, and the solition inst satisfying 2inst = f inst
is inst = f inst.

our basic observation is that the fermion zero mode   1. thus, if an operator

otop satises otop = 0, then otop contains no  fermion zero modes  it can only depend
on f inst, and possibly also any of the (8kc2(g)  16)  zero modes. if an operator or
has ror = otop, with otop = 0, then or has r  fermion zero modes.

the operator  annihilates the elds in the instanton background; in an anti-instanton

background the roles of  and  are reversed. assigning  charge 1 under u (1)y as in
[12] (the sign is to agree with the supergravity convention for the charges of the conjugate

sources), all operators with u (1)y charge q > 0 vanish in an instanton background, as
they are obtained with s on a u (1)y neutral primary. similarly, only those operators
with u (1)y charge q > 0 are non-vanishing in an anti-instanton background.

operators in short representations have u (1)y charge q with |q|  4. in particular, the
operator 4op has u (1)y charge 4 and thus must be annihilated if acted on by another
power of , 5op = 0. thus 4op can contain no  fermion zero modes, it can only depend
on f inst and the . more generally, a short operator with u (1)y charge q has

o(q)

s  4|q|,

(5.1)

in an instanton background, where the  includes some polynomial in f inst and .

similarly, operators in long representations have u (1)y charge |q|  8. an operator
of the form 8o can thus have no  zero modes in an instanton background, as it is

annihilated by . thus, for a generic operator in a long representation,

o(q)

l  8|q|,

(5.2)

in an instanton background, where again the  includes some polynomial in f inst and .
of course there are some long multiplets, obtained from trp with p < 4, which truncate

15

earlier on, i.e. the operator otop with otop = 0 has u (1)y charge |q|max < 8. an example
is the konishi operator ok = tr(ij ij ), for which |q|max = 4. as always, otop  0 and
thus the generalization of (5.2) to the other operators in the multiplet is o(q)
l  |q|max|q|.
i=1 o(qi)
i.

consider a correlation function of n operators in short representations, hqn

using (5.1), the condition for instantons to contribute to the correlation function is

i

nxi=1

(4  |qi|) = 16,

(5.3)

in which case the 16  zero modes can be saturated. it thus follows that instantons (or anti-

instantons) can contribute to a given n-point function of operators in short representations

if and only if

n = 4 +

|qt |

4

,

(5.4)

where qt =pn

i=1 qi is the total u (1)y charge. it thus immediately follows that instantons
can never contribute to n < 4-point functions of short operators; this is compatible with

the conjectured non-renormalization of [5,6] for n  3 point functions. we also see that

instantons can contribute to a n = 4-point function only if qt = 0; this is consistent with
the conjectured selection rule [12] that n  4 point functions with qt 6= 0 exactly vanish.
we were not able to nd a formula along the lines of (5.1) in [11], but expect that it

must be possible to prove, at least for su (n ), using the complete (and complicated) anal-

ysis presented there. demonstrating (5.1) would provide further support for the matching
between instantons and ads5  s5 supergravity results found in [10,11]. indeed, the re-
sulting relation (5.4) nicely agrees with results from iib string theory. see, for example,
sect. 3 of [20], where the grassman coordinates a, a = 1, . . . 16, correspond to the 16
zero modes  of the (d)-instanton. the supersymmetry generators qa = /a, which
matches with our basic observation that   1. relation (3.7) of [20] nicely corresponds

to our (5.1) and eqn. (3.14) of [20] corresponds to our (5.4). (this latter correspondence

uses the fact that stringy interactions involving n elds only contribute to n-point func-

tions; their contribution to correlation functions with fewer operators vanishes because the
elds involved vanish when evaluated in the ads5  s5 vacuum, as in [19].) while much of
the agreement found in [11] between multi-instanton collective coordinates and ads5  s5
relied on large n su (n ), we expect that (5.1) and (5.2) apply for any gauge group.

using (5.1) and (5.2) we also see that instantons can contribute to a ssl three-point

function, involving two short and one long operator, only if qt = 0. (more generally, for

16

a n-point function involving a generic long operator and n  1 short operators, instantons
contribute only if n = 3 + 1

4 |qt |.) therefore instantons are nicely compatible with our
conjectured selection rule (3.7). we also see that instantons can contribute to the two-

point function of two long operators only if qt = 0; this agrees with (3.5). (more generally,

instantons contribute to a n-point function involving two generic long operators and n  2

short operators only if n = 2 + 1

4 |qt |.)

6. perturbative checks of the selection rule for n  4 point functions.

a non-trivial perturbative check of (3.6) appears in [6], where the leading order radia-

tive corrections to a descendent correlation function, which would violate (3.6) if non-zero,

was found to vanish. if one believes the conjectured [5,6] non-renormalization of all 3-point

functions of short operators, the selection rule (3.6) for 3 short operators would follow be-

cause all correlation functions respect u (1)y in the gy m  0 limit [12]. because checks of

(3.6) for other (sss) descendent 3-point functions are similar to the example considered

in [6], we will not present any additional examples. instead, in this section, we will present

a non-trivial perturbative check of the selection rule (3.11) for 4-point functions of short

operators. in the next section, we present checks of the selection rule (3.7) involving two

short and one long operator.

we consider the 4-point function of short operators:

ho(2)

2

(x1)o(2)

2

(x2)o2(x3)o2(x4)i,

(6.1)

where o2(x) = [tr(2)](0,2,0) is the primary operator with u (1)y charge zero and o(2)
s(ij) is its second descendent, which appears in (4.2) and is a lorentz scalar in the (0, 0, 2)



2

representation of su (4)r. according (3.11), (6.1) must exactly vanish, for any gauge

group g, as it violates the u (1)y selection rule. note that the su (4)r group theory does

allow for a non-zero result for (6.1), so the vanishing is non-trivial.

we carried out the perturbative calculation in n = 1 component language, where only
su (3) subgroup of su (4) r-symmetry is manifest. specically, for the operators o(2)
we took avor combinations s11 and s44 dened in ref. [6], while o2(x3) = (z1)2 and

scalar propagators, solid ones fermion propagators.

o2(x4) = ztz. we denote the n = 1 scalar elds by z, while t is a traceless su (3) avor

generator.

there are 4 diagrams contributing to the 4-point function (6.1), they are depicted in

gure 1. the diagrams with exchanges of only scalar elds are straightforward to evaluate

and give

(a) = g2c2(g)|g| t11 g(x1, x2)2g(x1, x3)g(x2, x4)g(x3, x4)
(b) = g2c2(g)|g| t11 g(x1, x2)2g(x1, x4)g(x2, x3)g(x3, x4)

(6.2)

(c) = g2c2(g)|g|(t22 + t33)g(x1, x2)g(x1, x3)g(x1, x4)g(x2, x3)g(x2, x4),

where g(x, y) = 1/(42|x  y|2) is the free scalar propagator and the factors of c2(g)|g|
arise from factors of f abcfabc.

evaluating the diagram in g. 1(d) involves an eight-dimensional integral. we found

it easiest to perform such integrals in coordinate space using the technique of conformal

inversion [21]

(d) = ()g2c2(g)|g| t11(cid:2)g(x1, x2)2g(x3, x4) (g(x1, x3)g(x2, x4) + g(x1, x4)g(x2, x3))

 g(x1, x2)g(x1, x3)g(x1, x4)g(x2, x3)g(x2, x4)(cid:3).

(6.3)

the minus sign in front of the fermion contribution is the usual fermion loop factor.

contributions from diagrams (a) and (b) cancel against the rst two terms of the fermionic

diagram. the remaining part of diagram (d) and diagram (c) are proportional to

g2c2(g)|g| (t11 + t22 + t33),

(6.4)

which vanishes, for any gauge group g, since the su (3)f generator t is traceless.

18

7. perturbative checks of the (ssl) selection rule.

we now turn to some checks of the conjectured selection rule (3.7). as discussed in

sect. 4, there can be quantum corrections to descendents of long operators. to avoid this

subtlety, we rst consider the situation where the long operator ol in (3.7) is primary and
the short operators are descendents.

for our long primary operator, we take ol = trg(r+2s)(0,r,0) where s > 0 for this to
be a long operator and the subscript gives the dynkin indices of the su (4)r representation.
we can consider, for example, the 3-point function hol op oqi, for which su (4)r allows
a non-zero result provided r = p + q  1 (mod 2) in the range p + q  1  r  |p  q| + 1.

the leading contribution to this 3-point function, which would violate u (1)y conservation
if non-zero, occurs at order gy m and is associated with a single diagram, of the form
of diagram (a) in g. 2. fortunately this diagram vanishes because it involves a color
contraction of the form: f abcdei(bc), where f abc is associated with the yukawa interaction
and dei(bc) is associated with ol, which appears in the diagram at the vertex without a
fermion line. the sum vanishes due to the antisymmetry of f and symmetry of d in the

summed color indices ab. we refer to such vanishing as the d  f = 0 rule.

(c)

figure 2. examples of contributions to the three-point function (3.7). all these diagrams

vanish due to contractions of the color indices.

we have thus veried that the leading radiative corrections to hol op oqi vanish,
in agreement with (3.7). the task of verifying that radiative corrections continue to vanish

to higher orders in gy m appears to be quite complicated and tedious, and we have not
carried it out.

we note that su (4)r does not allow for a non-zero 3-point function of the form
holop2oqi, with primary ol. so, for our next examples, we consider hol 2op 2oqi,
where both 2op,q are either the (0, 0) lorentz or (1, 0) lorentz spin descendents, as in
(4.2). consider rst the case where both are the lorentz spin (0, 0) descendents. then

su (4)r allows for a non-zero result if p + q  2  r  |p  q| + 2, with r = p + q (mod 2).

19

the leading contribution to this 3-point function, which would violate u (1)y if non-zero,
occurs at order g2
y m and is associated with the diagrams (b) and (c) in g. 2. these
indeed vanish by the d  f = 0 rule, where again the d color factor is associated with the

ol vertex.

the leading order contribution to hol 2op 2oqi, where both 2op,q are the (1, 0)
y m . the relevant diagrams involve gauge eld
propagators, which seem to complicate matters, and we did not complete the task of

lorentz spin descendents, is at order g2

evaluating the diagrams and verifying that, as required by (3.7), they indeed sum to zero.

other cases for which the leading radiative contributions can be easily veried to
vanish are hol op oqi and hol op 2oqi. the relevant diagrams are again of the
types shown in g. 2 and, in both cases, they vanish by the d  f = 0 rule. evaluating the
leading radiative correction for hol 3op oqi is more dicult, as the diagrams involve
gauge eld propagators and, again, have not completed this task.

finally, we consider an example involving a second descendent of a long op-

1

82 g2

erator, where the quantum corrections found in (4.7) will prove crucial. consider
h2ok o2o2i, which has the su (4)r avor structure lij sab,iscd,j abcd. we con-

sider l44s12,4s34,4 in n = 1 component elds where, using (4.7), l44 = tr(cid:0)gy m z1[z2, z3]+
y m c2(g)( + gy m z1[z2, z3]) + . . .(cid:1), s12,4 = 2z3  z21 + z12, and s34,4 = 3z3.

the leading contribution to the correlation function is at order g2

y m and includes a
term g2
y m c2(g)|g|gf (x  y)gf (x  z)gb(y  z) at born level, coming from the order
y m terms come from the order gy m term in lij
y m correction in (4.7). the other order g2
g2
along with one interaction vertex. there are two identical contributions coming from the

z21 and the z12 terms in s12,4. the sum of these two contributions precisely cancel the

above additional term associated with the correction in (4.7). this is a non-trivial check of

our conjecture, as the coecient of the correction term in (4.7), which was precisely right

to cancel the radiative corrections found here, was independently determined in sect. 4.

8. comments on sl(2, z) s-duality and the ope

it was conjectured in [12] that an arbitrary n-point function of short operators trans-

forms under sl(2, z) modular transformations as

this conjecture was motivated by ads duality, but could apply generally for arbitrary
gauge groups3.

it is natural to expect that (8.1) applies for any operator correlation

function, including correlation functions involving long operators.

the conjecture (8.1), applied for arbitrary long or short operators, is compatible

with an ope expansion of correlation functions. since u (1)y charge is additive, it is
consistent to associate the modular transformation properties in (8.1) entirely with the

modular transformation properties of the ope coecients and metric. by our u (1)y
selection rule, the metrics ij (3.5) and csss
ijk ope coecients are expected to
be modular invariant under sl(2, z) transformations of  . as discussed above, according
to our conjectures ss

ij and csss

order to satisfy (8.1) the anomalous dimensions i of all operators must be modular
invariant; for short operators they are constant, while for long operators they should be

non-trivial, modular invariant, functions of  .

the u (1)y charge violation of general correlation functions is associated entirely with
the charge violation (qt )ijk of the ope vertices csll
ijk . correspondingly, the
non-trivial modular transformation properties (8.1) of a general correlation function is
