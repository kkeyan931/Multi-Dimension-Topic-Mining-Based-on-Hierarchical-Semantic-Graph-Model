we study d1-branes on the fourfold c4/(z2  z2  z2), in the presence of discrete torsion.
discrete torsion is incorporated in the gauge theory of the d1-branes by considering a projective
representation of the nite group z2  z2  z2. the corresponding orbifold is then deformed by
perturbing the f-atness condition of the gauge theory. the moduli space of the resulting gauge
theory retains a stable singularity of codimension three.

d-branes provide a geometric means to studying orbifold singularities and their desingularisations,
as the moduli space of d-branes reproduces the space in which the d-branes are embedded into.
within the scope of string theory, a generalisation of orbifold singularities, when possible, is to turn
on a discrete torsion [1, 2]. string theory on an orbifold of the n-dimensional complex space cn,
e.g. cn/g, where g is a nite group, admits discrete torsion if the second cohomology group of g,
viz. h 2(g, u(1)), is non-trivial. at this point, let us recall that here we are considering d-branes
on non-compact spaces, which may serve as local models of a compact target space of string theory
near a singularity. in the conformal eld theoretic description of the string world-sheet, turning on a
discrete torsion is tantamount to assigning a non-vanishing weight or phase to the contribution to the
string partition function arising in the twisted sector.

in studying a closed string theory on an orbifold in absence of discrete torsion, one can estimate
the contributions to the partition function arising in the untwisted and the twisted sectors of the theory,
by implementing the quotient in the path integral of the theory. the resulting spectrum, which is the
sum of all these contributions, turns out to coincide with that of the theory on the corresponding
smooth manifold [3].

the presence of discrete torsion alters the contribution from the twisted sector of the theory.
the resulting theory is still consistent as a string theory, but no more a string theory on a blown up
manifold. indeed, the resulting theory might be a consistent string theory on a singular target space
[2]. moreover, the modes in the twisted sector correspond to (partial) deformation of the complex
structure of the orbifold, not to the blowing up of the kahler class. now that the target space of
string theory can be simulated as the moduli space of d-branes, a natural question is whether one
can incorporate discrete torsion in this picture. this has been answered in the afrmative in some
examples [4, 5]. in this article we will nd one more example of this kind.

in terms of the supersymmetric gauge theories used to describe the theory on the world-volume of
d-branes, discrete torsion is incorporated in the action of the quotienting group on the position as well
as the gauge degrees of freedom carried by the brane. in the presence of discrete torsion one is led to
choose a projective representation of the group [4, 5], to be contrasted with the linear representation
used when discrete torsion is absent. the resolution of the orbifold in the absence of discrete torsion
is effected by adding a fayetiliopoulos term in the gauge theory, thereby perturbing the d-term of
the gauge theory. in the presence of discrete torsion, the moduli for the deformation of the singularity
are purveyed by parameters appearing in the perturbation of the f-term of the theory. in either case,
the choice of the perturbations of the f- and d-terms are guided by the twisted sector of closed string
theory in the presence and absence of discrete torsion, respectively [48].

d-branes on the three-dimensional orbifold c3/(z2  z2) have been studied in the absence of
discrete torsion [911], and in its presence as well [4,5]. in the absence of discrete torsion, the moduli
space of a d-brane on c3/(z2  z2) is a blown down conifold. adding fayetiliopoulos terms in the

1 introduction

2

gauge theory corresponds to partial [11] or complete [9, 10] resolution of the singularity, depending
on the non-vanishing combinations of the fayetiliopoulos parameters. however, the scenario is
rather different in the presence of discrete torsion [4, 5]. in this case, the twisted sector of string
theory provides modes not to resolve the singularity, but to deform it. yet, the moduli space turns
out to contain a stable double-point singularity or node, while the codimension-two singularities are
deformed away by these modes. this signals a deciency of certain modes in the twisted sector of
the closed string theory corroborating with earlier ndings [2].

in the present article we will concern ourselves with analysing a d1-brane or d-string on c4/(z2
z2 z2) in the presence of discrete torsion. d1-branes on this space without discrete torsion has been
studied earlier [12]. in the absence of discrete torsion, the analysis of the moduli space of d1-branes
on c4/(z2  z2  z2) parallels the analysis of d3-branes on c3/(z2  z2). the theory of d1-
branes on the singular orbifold is an n = (0, 2) super yang-mills theory in two dimensions.
in
the absence of discrete torsion the singularity in the moduli space is resolved by introducing fayet
iliopoulos terms in the action of the super yang-mills theory. the moduli space with perturbed d-
atness conditions, implementing the resolution of the orbifold, can be studied using the paraphernalia
of toric geometry, where the monomials of the toric description are provided by the unperturbed f-
atness condition of the theory.
in the presence of discrete torsion, however, it is the f-term of
the (0, 2) theory that admits a perturbation, involving six parameters. the d-atness conditions,
however, remain unaltered with respect to the theory on the singular orbifold. this corresponds to a
deformation of the singularity, rather than its resolution. the perturbation of the f-atness conditions
prevents employment of toric geometry in the description of the deformed variety. one is led to
consider the gauge-invariant quantities to furnish a description of the deformed variety. it is found
that, after desingularisation by f-term perturbations, the variety describing the moduli space of the
gauge theory retains a stable singularity of codimension three (line singularity), in the same manner
as its three-dimensional counterpart retains a conifold singularity after deformations [4, 5].

the plan of the article is as follows. we recount some features of the projective representations of
z2  z2  z2 in 2. in 3 we study the twisted sector of closed string theory on c4/(z2  z2  z2)
in the presence of discrete torsion. this analysis enables us to determine the number of perturbation
parameters allowed in the gauge theory. the low energy effective gauge theory of the d-brane on the
orbifold is discussed in the 4. in 5 we consider the vacua of the resulting gauge theory and nd out
the corresponding moduli spaces both with and without deformations, before concluding in 6.

notations and conventions: unless explicitly declared otherwise, we follow the following con-
ventions in notation and terminology in the sequel.

 the terms resolution (or blow up) and deformation of singularities are used in the usual senses.
the term desingularisation is used generally to mean either of these two, therby encompassing
partial removal of singularities.

2 projective representation & discrete torsion

in considering desingularisations of orbifolds of the type c4/g, discrete torsion corresponds to non-
trivial elements of the second cohomology group of the nite group g.1
it is incorporated in the
theory through the action of the group g on the chan-paton degrees of freedom by using an adjoint
action by a projective representation of g. in this section we will collect some facts [14] about the
projective representation of g, relevant for the present article.

given a nite group g, a mapping  : g  gl(n, c) is called a projective -representation of

g (over the eld c), provided there exists a mapping  : g  g  u(1), such that

1. (g)(g) = (g, g)(gg),

2. (1) = in,

for all elements g, g  g, where 1 denotes the identity element of g and in denotes the n n identity
matrix in gl(n, c). let us note that one can dene a projective representation over more general
elds [14]. here we are referring to the projective matrix representation over the eld of complex
numbers as the projective representation. it can be shown that  is a u(1)-valued two-cocycle of the
second cohomology group h 2(g, u(1)) of the nite group g. for our purposes  will be a complex
number with unit modulus. 2

generally, the second cohomology group h 2(g, u(1)) of a direct-product group of the form

g =

mo1

zn, is isomorphic to

m(m1)/2o1

zn. let gi denote the generator of the i-th zn factor appearing

mo1
n1ya=1

in g, i.e. g =

hgii. let gi, i = 1, 2,   , m, denote the generators of g. let us also dene

(i) =

(ga

i , gi)

and (i, j) = (gi, gj)(gj, gi)1,

i, j = 1, 2,   , m.

(2.1)

1see, however, [13] for more rigorous considerations on discrete torsion.
2usually the range of the map  is taken to be the multiplicative group c of the eld c of complex numbers. here

we will only consider the map  with unit modulus. so, we have taken the range to be u (1).

2 projectiverepresentation&discretetorsion

we may set  to be an n-th root of unity and  = 1, by replacing , if necessary, by a cohomologous
cocycle. the corresponding projective -representation of g is given in [14] for special values of  .
for our purposes it sufces to quote the results for the special case with m = 3 and n = 2.

thus, we will consider the projective representations of the group g = z2  z2  z2. let us

assume that g has the following action on the four coordinates z1,z2,z3,z4 of c4:

g1 : (z1, z2, z3, z4) 7 (z1,z2, z3, z4),
g2 : (z1, z2, z3, z4) 7 (z1, z2,z3, z4),
g3 : (z1, z2, z3, z4) 7 (z1, z2, z3,z4).

(2.2)

let g1, g2 and g3 denote the three generators of the three z2 factors. a generic element of g can be
written as g = g
3. we will denote this element by the symbol (abc). choosing the action of each
b
a
c
2g
1g
of the z2 factors to be a change of sign of z1 and one more out of z2, z3 and z4, we can write gi
from (2.2) as

g1 = g1 = (100),

g2 = g2 = (010),

g3 = g3 = (001).

(2.3)

the second cohomology group h 2(g, u(1)) of g is isomorphic to z2  z2  z2 [14]. the three
generators of the latter may be taken to be

1((abc), (abc)) = i(abba), 2((abc), (abc)) = i(bccb), 3((abc), (abc)) = i(caac).

(2.4)

let us note that i((abc), (abc)) = 1 for i = 1, 2, 3. hence, by (2.1), we have (i) = 1, for
in what follows we will consider the element  = 123. thus, we have, for all

i = 1, 2, 3.
g, g  g,

(g, g) = i

= 1

if g 6= g,
if g = g,

(2.5)

and consequently, (i) = 1 for i = 1, 2, 3, and  = 1. there are two irreducible -representations
of g, which are not linearly equivalent. these are given by [14]

(gi) = i.

(2.6)

the discrete torsion appearing in the path integral is determined by the choice of the two-cocycle. for
example, for the above choice of the two-cocycle, namely  = 123, the discrete torsion is given
by [4, 5]

((abc), (abc)) =(cid:16)((abc), (abc))(cid:17)2
= (1)abba+bccb+caac

,

,

(abc) 6= (abc)

(2.7)

which is the form used in [15]. each given value of the discrete torsion corresponds to a variety with
a different topology and leads to different types of gauge theories. these different varieties are related
by mirror symmetry [15].

let us point out that the discrete torsion  used in (2.5) is by no means more general than any
other two-cocycle. this can be interpreted as a phase between two of the z2 factors in g by a change
of basis. this fact will be reected in the moduli space of the brane in that, the maximally deformed
moduli space retains a singular line, unlike the point in [4, 5].

3 string(ent) restrictions on deformations

it has been known that string theory can be dened on certain kinds of singular spaces, especially
on orbifolds. in sigma-model compactication on orbifolds, the spectrum of string theory receives
contributions from the twisted sectors, thereby rendering string theory well-dened on such spaces.
in considering d-branes on orbifolds, the orbifold is realised as the moduli space of the gauge theory
on the world-volume of the brane. resolution or deformation of the quotient singularity is effected
by perturbing the gauge theory. however, compatibility of the desingularised d-brane moduli space
with string theory imposes stringent restrictions on such extra terms. in this section, we discuss these
restrictions.

the four-dimensional orbifold c4/(z2  z2  z2) in the blown down limit may be dened as an
afne variety embedded in c5 by the polynomial equation f (x, y, z, w, t) = 0, where the polynomial
is f (x, y, z, w, t) = xyzwt2, and x, y, z, w, t are the coordinates of c5. the z2z2z2 symmetry
can be made conspicuous by expressing the coordinates of c5 in terms of the afne coordinates of the
4, t = u1u2u3u4,
covering space of the variety, namely, c4. explicitly, x = u2
with {u1, u2, u3, u4}  c4. the polynomial f remains invariant under the three independent trans-
formations, which change the signs of, say u1, together with one out of {ui|i = 2, 3, 4} in turn.

let us briey recount the algebraic deformations of the equation f = 0. the possible deforma-
tions are given by the ring of polynomials q = c[x, y, z, w, t]/hfi, where f stands for the set of
the partial derivatives of f with respect to each of the arguments, i.e.

3, w = u2

1, y = u2

2, z = u2

f = {f /x, f /y, f /z, f /w, f /t},

and h  i denotes the ideal generated by    . thus, we have
hfi = hxyz, yzw, xyw, xzw, ti,

(3.1)

q = h1, xa, yb, zc, wd, xy, xz, xw, yz, yw, zwi,

where a, b, c, d are arbitrary integers. among the generators of q, terms such as xy deform the
six xed planes such as zw = 0, terms like x deform the four xed lines which correspond to
codimension-three singularities and nally 1 deforms the double-point singularity with codimension
four at the origin, t2 + x2 + y2 + z2 + w2 = 0.

however, as mentioned before, a physical theory, as the one we are considering, is not necessarily
potent enough to contain all the deformations that are mathematically admissible. within the scope
of our discussion with d1-branes, the four-dimensional orbifold is realised as the moduli space of
an n = (0, 2) super-yang-mills theory and its deformations are subject to consistency requirements
imposed by string theory. considering branes in the closed or type-ii string theory, these consistency
conditions are determined by the twisted sector of the theory on the orbifold. of the generators of
the ring q, only those deformations are physically allowed, that correspond to marginal operators in
the closed string theory on the orbifold. the marginal operators are related by supersymmetry to the
ramond-ramond (rr) ground states of the string theory. the latter, in turn, are determined by the
cohomology of the smooth target space that limits to the orbifold under consideration. to be more
explicit, let x be a manifold, and let x  = x/g be an orbifold, where g is a nite group of order

|g|. let ex be a desingularisation of the orbifold x .
gy

desingularisation

ex 

x = x/g

(3.2)

considering string theory on the orbifold x , the above-mentioned computation of rr ground states

yields the cohomology h (ex) of ex.
the desingularisation ex  x  can be effected in two different ways. one way is to blow up

the singularity at the origin. this corresponds to turning on a fayetiliopoulos term in the n = (0, 2)
gauge theory, and thereby perturbing the d-term of the gauge theory [12]. the other way is to deform
the singularity, discussed above. this corresponds to perturbing the f-atness conditions in the gauge
theory and is relevant for us in considering orbifolds with discrete torsion. at any rate, in order to
count the physically admissible perturbation modes in the gauge theory we need to consider closed
strings on the orbifold and evaluate the cohomology.

let us compute the cohomology of the space ex for this case, following [2, 5, 15, 16]. the general
g denote the set of (p, q)-forms on xg and letep,q denote the set of all (p, q)-forms on ex.

strategy is as follows. given an element g of the group g, we rst nd out the subset of x that is
xed under g. let us denote this subset by xg. the subset xg is endowed with (p, q)-forms, denoted
g . let p,q

where zi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are the coordinates of x. here r(h) denotes some representation of the
element h  g and  is the discrete torsion dened in (2.7). the cohomology in absence of discrete
torsion can be obtained by setting  = 1.

for the case at hand, the different elements of the group g = z2  z2  z2 xes three kinds
of subsets in x = c4  contributing hpq (p, q)-forms to ep,q. first, the identity of g xes c4
itself, that is, x(000) = c4. we shall refer to the corresponding contribution to the cohomology as the
contribution from the untwisted sector. the g-invariant forms are 1, dzi  dz i and dz1 dz2 dz3
dz4 and some of the dzs replaced by their complex conjugates. the contribution to the cohomology
h (ex) is summarised in the following hodge diamond:

(3.4)

these elements of h (ex) need be supplemented with the contribution from the twisted sector,
that corresponds to the other two kinds of xed sets. these are contributions from the g-invariant
forms from the xed subsets of x, under the non-trivial elements of g. we will refer to these as the
contribution from the twisted sector. the element (111)  g xes a point, x(111) = {0}, the origin
of c4, while each of the other six elements of g leaves xed a set c2  x.

the contribution from the untwisted sector is the same both in the presence and absence of discrete
torsion. contribution from the twisted sectors are different in the two cases. let us consider both the
cases in turn.

 withoutdiscretetorsion:

in the absence of discrete torsion the condition of g-invariance of the (p, q)-forms is given by
(3.3) with  = 1.

only the (0, 0)-form 1 is dened on x(111), which is a point. this is obviously g-invariant. the

age of (111)  g is s = 2. thus, this form contributes toe2,2, with h22 = 1.
each of the other six elements of g has age s = 1. each xes a c2  x. for example, (100)
xes the c2 coordinatised by z3 and z4. the g-invariant forms on this c2 are 1, dzi  dz i,
i = 3, 4 and dz3  dz4  dz 3  dz4. taking into account the shift by the age of this element,
the contribution to the hodge numbers are: h11 = 1, h22 = 2, h33 = 1. similar consideration
with each of the other ve elements leads to similar contribution to the cohomology. the total

contribution from the twisted sector to h (ex) is summarised in the following hodge diamond:

(3.5)

let us point out that since the contribution from the twisted sector is h11 = 6, the number
of perturbation parameters allowed in the gauge theory in the absence of discrete torsion is 6.
this is in keeping with the fact that there are six deformations of the d-atness condition [12].
let us point out that there is no symmetry guaranteeing that the contributions from the six
sectors mentioned above should be the same. that the contributions are indeed the same is a
coincidence and has to be checked on a case by case basis for each of the elements.

 withdiscretetorsion:

in the presence of discrete torsion, the condition of g-invariance of forms is generalised to
(3.3), with  dened by (2.7).

case without discrete torsion, namely h22 = 1.

the contribution to h (ex) corresponding to (111) happens to remain the same as that in the
however, the contribution from the other six do differ. considering (100), again, the invariant
forms on the xed c2 are dz3  dz4, dz3  dz4, dz3  dz 4 and dz 3  dz4. thus, taking
into account the shift by the age s = 1 of each of the elements, the contribution to h (ex) is

h22 = 2, h31 = 1. analysing similarly the contributions from the other ve elements, we get,
in the long run, the following hodge diamond arising from the twisted sector in the presence of
discrete torsion:

thus, we may have at most six deformations for the f-term, as they correspond to deformation of the
orbifold singularity and determined by h31. in the next section we will nd out the six possible terms.
let us note that the element (111)  g has age s = 2 and leads to a terminal singularity not
giving in to a crepant resolution. however, this does not affect the present analysis, as this is conned
to a consideration of perturbation of the gauge theory by the six parameters that correspond to the six
(3,1)-forms, none of which have been contributed by (111). let us point out in passing that by turning
on the discrete torsion we get the h11 and h(41)1 = h31 interchanged. this signies that the resulting
manifolds are related by mirror symmetry.

4 the gauge theory of the branes

in the regime of weak string coupling, d-branes admit a description in terms of a supersymmetric
yang-mills theory (sym) on their world volumes. the moduli space of the sym is interpreted as
the space-time. referring to the case at hand, the world-volume theory of n coalescing d1-branes
in type-iib theory is taken to be the dimensional reduction of the n = 1, d = 10 u(n) sym on
c4, or equivalently, the reduction of the n = 4, d = 4 sym on c2, down to two dimensions. the
resulting theory is an n = (8, 8), d = 2 u(n) sym. we will consider a fourfold transverse to the
world-volume of the d1-branes obtained as an orbifold of c4. the d1-brane is taken to be lying
along the 9-th direction, evolving in time along the 0-th direction. the c4 is coordinatised by zi,
i = 1, 2, 3, 4. let g be a nite group of order |g|. in order to retain some supersymmetry, g must be
a subgroup of the holonomy group of the fourfold, namely su(4). the theory of a single d1-brane
on the blown down orbifold c4/g is obtained by starting with a theory of |g| coalescing d1-branes
in two dimensions and then quotienting the resulting gauge theory with gauge group u(|g|), by g.
the resulting theory turns out to have n = (0, 2) supersymmetry in two dimensions [17].

it is convenient, in practice, to start with the n = 1 , d = 10 gauge theory reduced to two
dimensions written in a n = (0, 2) notation [18, 19]. finally one substitutes the elds those have
survived the orbifold projection. through the projection the supersymmetry will get broken down
to (0, 2). this theory corresponds to the theory of a d1-brane on the singular orbifold c4/g. the
deformation and/or blow up of the orbifold c4/g corresponds to adding extra terms to the above-
mentioned (0,2) action, with all elds taken to be the ones surviving the projection [17].

4.1 the gauge theory: before projection

let us begin with an inventory of the multiplets of n = (0, 2), d = 2 super-yang-mills theory
[17, 19, 20]. the eld-content of the theory is as follows. there are four complex bosonic elds,
denoted by zi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, identied with the four complex dimensions transverse to the world
volume. there are eight left-handed and eight right-handed majorana-weyl spinors which constitute

4 thegaugetheoryofthebranes

10

four left-handed dirac fermions and four right-handed dirac fermions. the left handed fermions are
 satisfying () =  and the three other can be grouped together as ij which is antisymmetric
in ij and satises (ij) = ijklkl. finally, there is a vector eld, whose two components will be
denoted by v, in the light-cone coordinates.

the elds mentioned above may be assorted into three supersymmetry multiplets, that is, into
three superelds. the vector eld and the fermion , from the left sector are combined to form the
vectormultiplet, whose components in the wess-zumino gauge are written as,

a = v  2i( + ) + 2()d,
a+ = ()v+,

(4.1)

where v are the vector elds and d is an auxiliary eld. the corresponding eld strength is given
by

f =   (f+ + id) + 2i()+,

(4.2)

where f+ = v+  +v.

four bosonicchiralmultiplets are formed from zi and four dirac spinors i coming from right

sector. the corresponding supereld takes the form

i = zi + 2i + 2i+zi,

(4.3)

where we have dened  =   iqa, and q denotes the charge of the vector multiplet under the
gauge group u(n).

finally, the three fermions ij, with hermitian conjugates dened as (ij) = ijklkl, are

gathered into three fermionicchiralmultipletswhich assume the following form:

i4 = i4 

2gi4  2i()+i4 

2 ei;

i = 1, 2, 3,

(4.4)

where gi4 denotes a bosonic auxiliary eld and ei represents a bosonic chiral eld.

the contributions of these multiplets to the action of the theory can be obtained [19] from the
reduction of ten-dimensional action. a more convenient way would be to start with four-dimensional
n = 1 action reduced to two dimensions which is a (2, 2) theory and then by integrating out one of
the s. these result in xing the chiral elds ei as ei = [i, 4]. the contributions of the above-
mentioned multiplets to the lagrangian of the theory are given by,

1

la =

2e2z dd tr (f f )
l = ixi z dd tr (ii)
2xi z dd tr (i4i4i)

l =

1

(4.5)

4 thegaugetheoryofthebranes

the total lagrangian obtained as the sum of the three pieces (4.5) admits a superpotential term,

while retaining n = (0, 2) supersymmetry. the corresponding piece of the lagrangian is given by

lw =

1

2z d w + h.c.,

(4.6)

where w is a chiral fermionic eld, the superpotential. the general form of w is w = tr pii4j i,

where j i denotes a bosonic chiral eld satisfying the supersymmetry-constraint

eij i = 0.

xi

thus, to sum up, the total action is given by

l = la + l + l + lw.

(4.7)

(4.8)

jacobi identity.

the reduced two-dimensional theory, in absence of extra couplings, the chiral eld j i in w assumes
the form, j i = pj,k ijk[j, k], which satises the supersymmetry constraint (4.7), thanks to the

the action corresponding to (4.8) has a global u(1)4 symmetry associated with the phases of
the bosonic elds of which the global u(1) is an r-symmetry of the theory. the bosonic potentials,
known as the f-term and the d-term, are obtained by integrating out the auxiliary elds gi4 and d,
respectively, appearing in l. these are given by

uf = 2xi,j
ud = 2e2xi

tr [zi, zj ]2,

tr [zi, z i],

(4.9)

(4.10)

respectively.

as we will see in presence of the coupling of d-string to twisted sector modes the superpotential

as well as the form the chiral elds ei will get modied.

4.2 the gauge theory: after projection

having discussed some generalities let us now implement the projection by g = z2  z2  z2. the
order of g is |g| = 8. hence we start with 8 branes at the origin, choosing the gauge group to be
u(8), and then quotient the theory by g. as mentioned earlier, the action of the group on the chan-
paton indices is given by the regular representation, obtained as direct sum of two copies of each of
the projective representations given in (2.6). thus, we have,

r(gi) = diag{i, i,i,i},

(4.11)

4 thegaugetheoryofthebranes

12

where r(gi) denotes the regular representation of the generator gi of the group g. the action of the
generators gi on the lorentz indices is as given in (2.2).

the projections are given by adjoint action of the regular representations r(gi) on the supermulti-

plets. in terms of the respective superelds, they take the form,

r(gi)ar(gi)1 = a,

r(gi)zir(gi)1 =

r(gi)ijr(gi)1 =

4xi=1
4xi ,j =1

r(gi)ijzj ,

r(gi)ii r(gi)jj i j ,

where we have introduced three matrices r(gi)ij, such that the equations (2.2) read

for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and i = 1, 2, 3.

gi : zi 7

4xj=1

r(gi)ij zj ,

(4.12)

(4.13)

the gauge group of the theory after projections (4.12) breaks down to u(2)  u(2) of which the
center of mass u(1) decouples which plays the role of the unbroken u(1) for the single brane. the
rest of the group u(1) su(2) su(2) is broken by the vacuum expectation values of the following
higgs eld

zi = 

! ,
where zi, wi are 2  2 matrices. the charges are assigned through,
wi 7 v wiu 

zi 7 uzi v ,

wi  i

0

zi  i

0

(4.14)

(4.15)

where u and v belong to the two su(2)s and zi and wi have opposite charges under the relative
u(1). the representation of the chiral fermi eld is the same as that of the commutators of the
bosonic elds, which is consistent with the presence of the e eld in the multiplet. thus, we have

i4 = 1

i  i
0

0

i  i! .

2

(4.16)

the elds after projection are then substituted in the action in order to derive the theory of the sin-
gle brane on c4/g. the moduli space is described by the solutions of the conditions of f-atness and
d-atness, obtained by minimising the f-term and the d-term, respectively. the f-atness conditions
are given by

zjwi + ziwj = 0,

wjzi + wizj = 0,

z4wi  ziw4 = 0,
w4zi  wiz4 = 0,

(4.17)

4 thegaugetheoryofthebranes

13

for i = 1, 2, 3.

let us now consider the deformation of this moduli space in the presence of non-zero coupling
with elds in the twisted sector of the closed string theory. in the discussion of the closed string
twisted sectors in 3, we noticed that each of the six group elements which ips the sign of zis
pairwise contributes (3, 1), responsible for the deformation of the complex structure of the singular
orbifold. these are complex numbers and hence couple naturally to the superpotential [4, 5]. geo-
metrically, these deform away codimension-two singularities.

one set of the natural modication of the superpotential comes from its four-dimensional ana-

logue. starting with a term of the formr dii, where i is a four-dimensional chiral eld, reducing

to two dimension and integrating one  out yields a term

where i denotes the coupling parameters, of the form

i = i  i

0

w =

3xi=1z d+ tr (ii4),
i  i! .

0

(4.18)

(4.19)

the form of i is determined by the gauge-invariance of the coupling and by the fact that its intro-
duction does not break supersymmetry according to (4.7). a simple calculation leads to the above
expression without any loss of generality, provided i do not depend on the other elds.

these perturbations give rise to a deformation of the f-term equation as

zjwi + ziwj = eijkk,

wjzi + wizj = eijkk,

(4.20)

where i = 1, 2, 3, and e123 = +1, eijk is symmetric under interchange of i, j but non zero only when
i, j, k are all different.

the form of the other perturbations can be obtained by treating all the 4 coordinates of the trans-
verse space on same footing. this perturbations can be introduced by making use of the freedom in
the denition of e which correspond to a perturbation of the eld ei in the fermionic multiplet given
by

where

ei  ei + i,

i = i  i

0

0

i  i! .

(4.21)

(4.22)

here also the form of the coupling is determined by the fact that i should transform in a similar way
as ei and it should not break supersymmetry (4.7).

5 themodulispaceanditsdeformation

to sum up, the f-term equations following from these perturbations are given by

zjwi + ziwj = eijkk,

wjzi + wizj = eijki,

z4wi  ziw4 = i,
wiz4  w4zi = i.

14

(4.23)

we shall sometimes refer to (4.23) as the f-atness equations. let us note that, we have six parameters
i, i, i = 1, 2, 3, appearing in the perturbation of the gauge theory. this is in keeping with the fact
that, the contribution to the cohomology of the resolved space, arising in the twisted sector is h31 = 6,
as discussed in 3.

5 the moduli space and its deformation

let us now go over to nding the vacuum moduli space of the (0,2) theory discussed in the previous
section. the vacuum moduli space is the space of allowed values of the scalars zi, respecting the f-
and d-atness conditions, up to gauge equivalence.

5.1 gauge-invariant polynomials

thus, we have the four matrices zi, in the form (4.14), and the f-atness conditions (4.23) on the
non-vanishing 22 blocks of zi, namely zi and wi. the equation of the variety describing the moduli
space of the conguration will be written in terms of the gauge-invariant polynomials constructed out
of zi and wi. we proceed to describe these next.

let us introduce the following expressions,

1
2
1
2

tr ziwj zk    ,
tr wizj wk    ,

(5.1)

which we will refer to as polynomials. by the order of a polynomial, we mean the total number of
z and w appearing in the polynomial  that is, the length of the word inside the trace. we need to
introduce a few further notations which we list here:

pijk =

epijk =

qij = ziwj ,
1
2

tr qii,

xi =

let us also note that,

it then follows from (5.1) that

pij =

1
2

tr qij

eqij = wizj ,
tr eqii .
exi =
exi = xi.
epij =

1
2

tr eqij

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

5 themodulispaceanditsdeformation

15

now, the polynomials of different orders dened by (5.1) are not linearly independent. we need to
nd out the independent polynomials in order to write down the equation of the variety. at this point
let us note that from the gauge transformation (4.15) it follows that only the polynomials of even order
are gauge-invariant quantities. hence in what follows we shall not consider the polynomials of odd
orders. let us consider the remaining polynomials order by order.

 order 2 polynomials

using the constraints (4.23), it can be shown that qii commute pairwise. hence, assuming that
these matrices are non-singular, the matrices qii can be simultaneously diagonalised. from
now on we assume that qii, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are diagonal. moreover, qij with i 6= j commute
with qii, but not between themselves; for example, q12 and q23 do not commute. hence, in a
basis in which qii are diagonal, qij, with i 6= j are necessarily generic, i.e. not diagonal. it
then follows, from the fact that qij, with i 6= j and qii commute, that qii are all proportional
to the two-dimensional identity matrix, i2. moreover, if zi and wi are non-singular matrices,
which also we assume, it follows that eqii is also proportional to i2. thus we have,

(5.6)

and consequently,

qii = eqii = xi i2,

pii = xi.

(5.7)

the f-atness conditions (4.23) impose further constraints on qij with i 6= j. we will use
these later.
since the polynomials pij and epij satisfy epij = pji, it sufces to consider either set. the
twelve polynomials pij with i 6= j are not linearly independent. the f-atness conditions
(4.23) reduce these to a set of three independent ones. there are three further relations among
these six, namely,

2p24  3p34 + 2p13  3p12 = 0,
1p14  2p24  1p23 + 2p13 = 22  11,
1p14  3p34 + 1p23 + 3p12 = 33.

(5.8)

the equations (5.8) can be derived by considering certain polynomials of order 4 and using
properties of trace of products of matrices and (4.23). for example, the rst equation in (5.8)

5 themodulispaceanditsdeformation

16

follows from p1243 as,

p1243 =
=

tr w1z3w4z2

tr (2  w3z1)(2 + w2z4)
= 22 + 2p13 + 2p42  p1243,

(5.9)

and further using (4.23). the second and third relations follow similarly by considering p1243
(again!) and p2341 respectively. thus, nally we are left with seven gauge-invariant polynomi-
als of order two.

 order 4 polynomials

2xi xj

different are determined in terms of p1234 and certain polynomials of order 2.

three cases arise for the polynomials pijkl.
1. piijk for all i, j, k. these are determined in terms of pii and pjk by virtue of (5.6).
2. piijj = 1
3. p1234  this is an independent polynomial. other order 4 polynomials with all indices
as for the polynomials epijkl,
1. epiijk for all i, j. these are determined in terms of epii and epjk by virtue of (5.6), and
the latter are related to pii and pjk in turn, again by (5.6).
2. epiijj are also determined in terms of the are determined by xi

1

epiijj =

2exiexj
3. ep1234 is determined in terms of p1234 by the relation

1
2

=

xixj .

ep1234 = p1234 +

1
2

as a consequence of the f-atness conditions (4.23)

thus, we conclude that, the only independent polynomial of order four is p1234.

(11  22 + 33),

(5.10)

5 themodulispaceanditsdeformation

17

 polynomials of order higher than 4

these can all be expressed in terms of polynomials of lower order. some of these relations
follow by (5.6) and (5.7), while the others follow by an use of the cayleyhamilton theorem.
as an example of the latter cases, let us consider the polynomial p111134 = 1
2 tr z1w1z1w1z3w4.
the cayley-hamilton theorem leads to the following equation for any 2  2 matrix, m.
2(cid:16)(tr m)2  tr m2(cid:17)i2 = 0.
11  p1111(cid:17)i2 = 0.

m2  m tr m +
z1w1z1w1  2z1w1p11 +(cid:16)2p 2

now, taking m = z1w1, we have

(5.11)

(5.12)

1

multiplying by z3w4 and taking trace we obtain

p112234 = 2p11p1134  2p 2

11p34 + p1111p34.

(5.13)

thus, the polynomial p112234 of order six is expressed in terms of polynomials of lower order.
other polynomials of order higher than four can be treated similarly. in particular, in any polynomial
of order say (4 + k), k > 0, at least k indices come repeated. using (4.23) it is always possible
to gather these repeated indices together and use the proportionality of qii to the identity matrix to
reduce it to some combination of lower order polynomials or use the cayley-hamilton theorem as
above. thus, nally we have ten independent, gauge invariant polynomials of order two and one of
order four. the vacuum moduli space is described by an equation involving these polynomials upon
using the f-atness conditions.

5.2 the variety

now, in order to write down the equation for the variety describing the moduli space, let us introduce
a 4  4 matrix m, dened as follows.

1

1

1

mii = pii,
mij =
mi4 =
m4i =

2(cid:16)pij + epij(cid:17),
2(cid:16)epi4  pi4(cid:17),
2(cid:16)ep4i  p4i(cid:17)
2i(cid:16)p1234 + ep1234(cid:17),

= mi4,

1

for i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 ans i, j = 1, 2, 3. dening another complex variable t as

t =

(5.14)

(5.15)

5 themodulispaceanditsdeformation

the equation of the variety is written as

t2 = detm.

18

(5.16)

we now write this in terms of t and xi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and use (4.23). the matrix m now assumes the
following form:

m =

3/2
x2
1/2

x1
3/2
2/2
1/2 2/2 3/2

2/2
1/2
x3

1/2
2/2
3/2
x4



.

(5.17)

the matrix m is the most general one consistent with the global u(1)4 symmetry, provided we assign
the correct charges to the parameters  and  from the action.

the relation (5.16) can be argued from the algebra of the matrices qij that follows from (4.23).
any solution is a represenattion of the algebra and it can be shown from the algebra that in the generic
case the moduli are related through (5.16).

hence the equation of the variety becomes

where we have dened

f (x1, x2, x3, x4, t) = 0,

f (x1, x2, x3, x4, t) = x1x2x3x4

(5.18)

(5.19)

that the equation (5.18) is indeed satised by solutions of the f-atness conditions should be explic-
itly checked on any solution of (4.23). let us verify this in some examples.

example 1
when i = i = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, a solution of (4.23) is given by

zi = zii

wi = wii ,

i = 1, 2, 3, 4,

(5.20)

5 themodulispaceanditsdeformation

19

where zi and wi are complex numbers. the f-atness constraints (4.23) impose the following
relations among zi and wi:

z1w2 = z2w1,

z1w4 = z4w1,

z2w3 = z3w2,

z2w4 = z4w2,

z3w1 = z1w3,

z3w4 = z4w3.

(5.21)

we also need the constraints ensuing from the d-atness condition (4.10), namely

|z1|2 + |z2|2 + |z3|2 + |z4|2  |w1|2  |w2|2  |w3|2  |w4|2 = 0.

(5.22)

let us note that only the three relations written in the second column of (5.21) are independent
 the other three relations in the rst column follow from these. also, note that the three
equations in the second column of (5.21) are monomial equations. therefore, we can give a
toric description to the envisaged variety, following [7]. in the notation of [10], we can express
the variables zi, wi, in terms of the ve independent variables, which we choose to be z1, z2,
z3, z4 and w4. this is expressed as:

z1

and provides part of the charge matrix for the variety. we can also nd out the charges of the
ve independent variables under a c from the d-atness condition (5.22) as

v =(cid:16)1 1 1 1 1(cid:17) .

the charges of the homogeneous coordinates pi under this c are obtained from v , using a

5 themodulispaceanditsdeformation

which is the same as (5.18) with i = i = 0. the ve variables appearing in the above equation
are expressed in terms of the gauge-invariant combinations described earlier, as follows.

xi = zi wi ,

i = 1, 2, 3, 4,

t =

(z1w2z3w4 + w1z2w3z4).

(5.31)

thus, we have veried the claim that (5.18) is indeed the equation of the variety describing the
vacuum moduli space.

let us now verify the claim in the case where all the deformation parameters are non-vanishing. we
wish to have a solution which goes over to the solution given in the previous example in the limit of
vanishing deformation parameters.

example 2
let us present the solution rst.

z1 = z11 + 32/2w2, w1 = w11 + 32/2z2,

z2 = z22 + 13/2w3, w2 = w22 + 13/2z3,

z3 = z33 + 21/2w1, w3 = w33 + 21/2z1,

(5.32)

z4 = z44 + 11 + 22 + 33, w4 = w44 + (11 + 22 + 33),

where zi and wi satisfy the equations (5.21) and the three complex variables 1, 2, 3 solve
the following set of three relations:

and we have dened

2z1w33 + 21  3z1 = 0,
2z2w11 + 32  1z2 = 0,
2z3w22 + 13  2z3 = 0,

(5.33)

(5.34)

by (5.21). it should be noted that zi and wi as given in (5.32), satisfy the f-atness conditions
(4.23) if zi and wi satisfy (5.21). hence, as above, the corresponding variety is again a fourfold,
given by (5.18) in c5. however, the d-atness conditions alter from (4.10). in terms of the


5 themodulispaceanditsdeformation

we have used (5.21) in writing the expression for t in (5.35). the equation (5.18) is satised
for these values of the ve variables.

let us note that, as mentioned above, we have the same equations among the different variables
zi and wi in the present case, as in example 1 above. however, the d-atness conditions are
now different and involves the parameters i and i. we have not solved the d-atness equa-
tions. however, the above solution should be gauge-equivalent to a solution that simultaneously
solves the f- and d-atness equations [21]. the variety, anyway, is different from the one in
the previous example.

5.3 special branches

returning to the equation (5.18) for the variety, it has a variety of singularities depending on the values
of the deformation parameters i and i. the singular subsets of the variety (5.18) are simultaneous
solutions of f = 0 and f = 0, as noted in 3. we list some of the cases below.
nb:
to avoid clumsy factors in the expressions.

in this subsection we have rescaled the parameters i and i to 2i and 2i respectively, in order

1. in the limit of vanishing deformation, i = i = 0, we recover the singular orbifold. this has a
z2  z2  z2 singularity at the origin, along with higher dimensional singular subspaces, all of
which contain the origin.

2. when all i = 0, we can have one, two or all three of the i non-vanishing.

(a) i 6= 0. this has a line singularity along x4, with x1 = x2 = x3 = t = 0.
(b) 1 = 0, 2, 3 6= 0. this also has a line singularity along x4, with xi = t = 0.

(5.36). the case with i 6= 0, i = 0 will be similar.

(c) 1 = 0 and 2, 3 6= 0. there is no singularity. this can also be seen by taking the limit

(d) the case with 2 = 0, 1, 3 6= 0 is similar to (3c).
(e) 1 6= 0, 2 = 3 = 0. this has a line singularity along x1 with x2 = x3 = x4 = 0. this is

similar to the case with 2 6= 0, 3 6= 0 and the rest of the parameters vanishing.

where we have dened a = 11, b = 22 and c = 33 and x is an arbitrary complex number.

the different cases with some of the i set to zero can be obtained from (5.41) by setting the
parameters a, b, c to zero accordingly.

moreover, in the above discussion, we have assumed generic values of the six parameters i and i,
whenever non-zero. several other special branches can be obtained by relating these non-vanishing
parameters. these can be obtained from the corresponding cases in the above list.

5.4 the moduli space for other representations of g

so far we have used the eight-dimensional regular representation of g, constructed by tensoring the
four-dimensional projective representation diag{i ,i}, from (2.6) with im, with m = 2. this
corresponds to a single brane at the orbifold singularity. the theory with n branes at the singularity
can be obtained, in a similar way as above, using im , such that 4m = 23n. the moduli spaces
for congurations with n > 1 branes, or equivalently m > 2, can be found in the same manner as
discussed above. however, it has been pointed out [4, 5] that string theory allows also the case with
m = 1. let us discuss this case briey in this subsection.

the quantities zi and wi appearing in (4.14) are now numbers, instead of 2  2 matrices. the
m = 1 moduli space ensues by imposing the f-atness conditions (4.23) on the complex numbers zi
and wi.

we can dene the gauge-invariant polynomials as above. however, in the present case, the poly-
nomials z1w2z3w4 and w1z2w3z4 are not independent, but determined by polynomials of order two,
e.g. 2z1w2z3w4 = 1

2(a  b + 3c) + 3z3w4 + 3z1w2. thus, we dene only the four variables

x1 = ziwi,

i = 1, 2, 3, 4,

(5.42)

as above.

6 conclusion

25

when i = i = 0, we have, the f-atness equations (4.23), can be partially solved with, e.g.z1 =

z2 = w1 = w2 = 0. this leaves us with the following f-atness condition

and the d-ateness equation, now reduced to

z3w4  z4w3 = 0,

|z3|2 + |z4|2  |w3|2  |w4|2 = 0.

(5.43)

(5.44)

this space admits a toric description, thanks to the monomial relation (5.43). following the steps
outlined in example 1 above, it can be seen that the moduli space is a c2/z2-plane

xz  y2 = 0,

(5.45)

where x, y, z are three complex numbers. the same exercise can be repeated with other pairs of zi
and wi, corresponding to other possible solutions of the f-atness equations. since there are six such
solutions, six c2/z2-planes arise and the moduli space is given as the union of these six planes. these
six planes can be interpreted as associated with the invariant subspaces of the six group elements each
of which contribute a deformation. the fractional brane may be a d3-brane wrapped on a vanishing
two-sphere transverse to the plane. however a conrmmation of this needs more involved analysis.
6= 0, three of the equations in (4.23) involving z4 and w4 are solved by

when i = 0, and i

wi = szi, where s is a constant. the three rest can be rewritten as

x1x2 = 2
x2x3 = 2
x3x1 = 2

3/4,
1/4,
2/4,

(5.46)

while x4 = sz2

4. the solution to these equations furnishes the moduli space, which is a line given by

x1 =

23
21

,

x2 =

31
22

,

x3 =

12
23

,

(5.47)

with x4 arbitrary.

finally, when all i and i are non-zero, the moduli space is described by equations involving xi,
i = 1, 2, 3 in a similar, but more complicated way, as above. these can again be solved for xi, while
x4 is left arbitrary. thus, the moduli space is again a line.

6 conclusion

to summarise, we have studied a d1-brane on the four-dimensional orbifold singularity c4/(z2z2
z2), with discrete torsion. the resulting moduli space in absence of any deformation is the singular

6 conclusion

26

orbifold given by the equation t2 = x1x2x3x4 in c5, as found earlier [12]. the deformations of the
moduli space in the presence of discrete torsion correspond to perturbations of the superpotential of
the corresponding (0, 2) sym in two dimensions, and are constrained by consistency requirements
from string theory on the orbifold. the moduli arising in the twisted sector of string theory now
deform away certain singularities of codimensions one and two, which in turn correspond to some
subsets of c4 xed by certain elements of the group g = z2  z2  z2. this is in harmony with
expectations from conformal eld theoretic description. but the singularity with codimension three
turns out to be stable, as the twisted sector of the closed string theory fails to provide the modes
required for its deformation. that the stable singularity is a line and not a point, unlike its three-
dimensional counterpart [4, 5], is rooted in the peculiarity of discrete torsion. as mentioned in 2,
the discrete torsion , in spite of its deceptive general appearance in (2.5), is actually between two
z2 factors out of the three in the quotienting group z2  z2  z2. by a suitable change of basis, we
can thus think of the discrete torsion as affecting only a z2  z2 subgroup of g, acting on a subset
c3  c4. apart from the details of further quotienting by a z2, it is the node of this c3/(z2  z2)
[4, 5], that gives rise to the singular line.

indeed, this aspect of discrete torsion has featured in studies of mirror symmetry on this orbifold.
starting from the calabi-yau manifold obtained as the blown up t8/(z2  z2  z2), which is the
compact version of our case at hand, one can t-dualise the type-ii string theory on this manifold
along the t4-bres, to obtain the same string theory on the deformed t8/(z2  z2  z2) singularity.
the t-dualities along the four directions of the t4 administers the right dose of discrete torsion
as in here, such that the two theories are mirror-dual to each other. this situation provides a non-
trivial demonstration of mirror symmetry [15]. thus, the situation considered in the present article
is expected to be mirror-dual to the moduli space obtained by considering d-brane in absence of
discrete torsion [12]. a comment is in order. in absence of discrete torsion, a d1-brane on the orbifold
c4/(z2  z2  z2) resolves the orbifold singularity with seven fayetiliopoulos parameters [12]. in
view of the fact that for this resolution, h11 = 6, as we found in 3, this signies that the resolved
moduli space is smooth but not calabi-yau [18]. it is not clear at the moment if one should invoke the
mirror principle beyond calabi-yau varieties [22] to incorporate another parameter of deformation
in the present case also, superceding the restrictions arising from the twisted sector of string theory.
if so, then this will call for a formulation of consistency conditions beyond the stringy ones studied
here.

another implication of this conguration is related to the fact that discrete torsion can be simulated
through an antisymmetric b-eld background [1]. on c3/(z2  z2), the b-eld has a non-zero eld
strength supported at the singular point as necessitated by supersymmetry [2]. in the present case, by
an s-duality transformation, we may change the d-string into a fundamental string (in typeiib) and
the background ns-ns b-eld to an rr b-eld. thus, the present analysis can also be interpreted
as describing a fundamental string at an orbifold in presence of a background rr b eld which has a

non-zero eld strength only on a line singularity at the classical level.

finally, in the case of orbifold singularities there exist parallel brane congurations that give rise to
the theory of branes at the singularity. in particular, one can also map the desingularisation moduli of
the singularity to the parameters of the brane congurations [23]. it would be interesting to understand
the analogous brane congurations corresponding to present case and identify the presence as well
as the absence of the various deformation modes, which will provide another way of looking at the
orbifolds with discrete torsion.
