gauge hierarchy from ads5 universe with

3-branes

abstract

if the universe is ( or a slice of ) ads5 space with 3-branes, the 5-dimensional
gut scale on each brane can be indetied as the 5-dimensional planck scale,
but, the 4-dimensional planck scale is generated from the low 4-dimensional
gut scale exponentially in our world. the 4-dimensional gut scales and
planck scale are related to the 5-dimensional gut scales and planck scale by
exponential factors, respectively. one of such scenarios was suggested by ran-
dall and sundrum recently. we give another scenario that the 4-dimensional
planck scale is generated from the low ve-dimensional planck scale by an ex-
ponential hierarchy, and the mass scale in the standard model is not rescaled
from the 5-dimensional metric to the 4-dimensional metric. we also argue
that the additional constant in the solution might exist, which will rescale the
5-dimensional planck scale and aect the physical scale picture. finally, we
embed those compactications to the general compactication on ads5 space
and discuss the origin of the additional constant.

1 introduction

experiments at lep and tevatron have given the strong support to the standard
model of the strong and electroweak interactions. however, the standard model
has some unattractive features which may imply the new physics beyond standard
model. one of these problems is that the gauge forces and the gravitational force are
not unied. another is the gauge hierarchy problem between the weak scale and the
4-dimensional planck scale. previously, two solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem
have been proposed: one is the idea of the technicolor and compositeness which lack
calculability, and the other is the idea of supersymmetry, but we have not found any
experimental signal at colliders yet.

more than one year ago, it was suggested that the large compactied extra
dimensions may be another solution to the gauge hierarchy problem [1]. if the di-
mension of the spacetime is 4 + n where n > 1, the 4-dimensional planck scale is
determined by the fundamental 4 + n dimensional planck scale mx. for the simplest
case, we have the relation between these two scales:

m 2

p l = m n+2

x vn ,

(1)

where vn is the physical volume of the extra dimensions. of course, if we required
that mx is at low energy scale, then we may have the hierarchy between the mx
and v 1/n
except that one needs to introduce many extra dimensions. if we assume
mx = 105gev , v 1/n

= 104gev , we obtain:

n

n

n = 1026 ,

(2)

which might not seem possible, but it is not excluded.

several months ago, randall and sundrum [2] proposed another scenario that
the extra dimension is an orbifold, and the size of the extra dimension is not large but
the 4-dimensional mass scale in the standard model is suppressed by an exponential
factor from 5-dimensional mass scale.
in addition, they suggested that the fth
dimension might be innity [3], and there may exist only one brane with positive
tension at the origin, but, there exists a gauge hierarchy problem for they thought
k, which is dened in the following section, is equal to the 5-dimensional planck
scale. the remarkable aspect of the second scenario is that it gives rise to a localized
graviton eld. combining those results, lykken and randall obtained the following
physical picture [4]: the graviton is localized on planck brane, we live on a brane
separated from the planck brane about 30 planck lengths along the fth dimension.
on our brane, the mass scale in the standard model is suppressed exponentially,
which gives the low energy scale. recently, this kind of compactication or similar
idea has attracted much attentions [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

before discussing our results, rst, we would like to point out that one needs
to choose a fundamental metric in the scale discussion. for example, in the weakly
coupled string, to be consistent, we use the string metric to discuss the scale. in ad-
dition, we assume that all the gauge forces are unied on each 3-brane if there exist

1

gauge forces. the 5-dimensional gut scale on each 3-brane and the 5-dimensional
planck scale are dened as the gut scale and planck scale in the 5-dimensional fun-
damental metric ( for example, equation (3) or (4) ), respectively. the 4-dimensional
gut scale on each brane and the 4-dimenisonal planck scale are dened as the gut
scale and planck scale in the 4-dimensional minkowski metric (g).
in order to
avoid the gauge hierarchy problem between the weak scale and the 4-dimensional
gut scale mgu t on the brane which is our world, we assume the low energy uni-
cation 2. the key ansatz is that the 5-dimensional gut scale on each brane is equal
to the 5-dimensional planck scale, and there is no mass hierarchy between the mass
parameters in the 5-dimensional fundamental metric if the fth dimension is compact
3.

with above argument and assumptions, we nd out the constant in the so-
lution of 5-dimensional einstein equation is not a trivial factor, and will aect the
5-dimensional planck scale and the physical picture if there exists such constant in
the fundamental metric, for example, in m-thoery on s1/z2[15], only the metric at
mid point between two hyperplanes is not changed after one considers the next order
correction without ve branes [16], and the constant in the metric may have its origin
in the compactication on ads5 space. in short, the general solution to the einstein
equation obtained in ve-dimensional model with two boundaries (branes) are:

ds2 = e2k|y|2cdxdx + dy2 ,

ds2 = e2k|y|2cdxdx + dy2 ,

(3)

(4)

where ,  parametrize the four-dimensional coordinates of minkowski space, and y
is the fth dimension coordinate.

the rst solution is the same as the solution given by randall and sundrum
except the constant c [2]. the general physical scale picture is the following: the
5-dimensional gut scale on each brane can be identied as the 5-dimensional planck
scale, but, the 4-dimensional planck scale is generated from the low 4-dimensional
gut scale exponentially in our world. the 4-dimensional gut scales and planck
scale are related to the 5-dimensional gut scales and planck scale by exponential
factors, respectively.
in other words, the large mass hierarchy [2] in the standard
model from the 5-dimensional metric to the 4-dimensional metric is one possible
solution of the gauge hierarchy problem in our world, but, not the most general
solution. in addition, the fth dimension may be compact [2], or the fth dimension
may be non-compact. there is a brane with positive tension ( call it as  hidden
brane ) at the origin, the 4-dimensional gut scale mh on the hidden brane is
larger than or the same as the 4-dimensional gut scale of our world. we live on

2we will not explain why mgu t can be low energy scale here, but, it is possible if one considers
additional particles which change the rge running. of course, proton decay might be the problem,
but we do not disscuss this here.

3we do not consider the masses of quarks and leptons in this statement.

2

a brane separated from the hidden brane about a distance ln(mh /mgu t )/k along
the fth dimension where k is not necessary to be equal to the 5-dimensional planck
scale in this case for the fth dimension is not compact. similar to ref. [3], we also
suggest that: we live on a positive tension brane ( at origin ) which is embedded in
a non-compact ads5 space and contains the standard model. the ve-dimensional
planck scale or the 4-dimensional gut scale is at intermediate scale 108 gev, then,
in this case, mgu t /mw  mtop/melectron.
the second solution tells us that the 5-dimensional planck scale will be rescaled
even though one considers c = 0. assuming c=0, we can obtain the scenario with
the following property: the 4-dimensional planck scale is generated from the low
5-dimensional planck scale by an exponential hierachy, and the mass scale in the
standard model, which is contained in one brane, is not rescaled.
in general, for
c 6= 0, the 5-dimensional gut scale on each brane can be considered as the 5-
dimensional planck scale, but, the 4-dimensional planck scale is generated from the
low 4-dimensional gut scale exponentially in our world. the 4-dimensional gut
scales and planck scale are related to the 5-dimensional gut scales and planck scale
by exponential factors, respectively. the physical scale picture is similar to that in
the rst solution except that we can not let the fth dimension non-compact in this
case.

we also discuss the compactication on ads5 space, and all of above scenarios
can be embedded in this kind of compactication. however, in all of above scenarios,
the cosmology constant and brane tensions in the 4-dimensional minkowski metric
can be expressed as simple functions of 4-dimensional gut scale and planck scale,
therefore, it seems to us that we can not explain the very small cosmology constant
1058gev 4 in this kind of compactication.

of course, the results in this letter can be generalized to ads4+n, and can be

applied to type iib string on ads5  s5 or m-theory on ads7  s4.

2 solutions to the einstein equation

the setup is given by randall and sundrum [2]. considering a compact fth dimen-
sion, l  y  l and introducing equivalence relations: y  y + 2l and y  y, we
obtain the obifold s1/z2. the xed points y=0, l are taken as the locations of the
two 3-branes, which can support 4-dimensional eld theories. let us denote the y=0,
l planes as m0 and m1 respectively, the 5-dimensional metric in these two branes
are:

g0
(x)  g(x, y = 0) , g1

(x)  g(x, y = l) ,

where gab where a, b = , y, is the ve-dimensional metric.

the classical lagrangian is given by:

s = sgravity + s0 + s1 ,

s0 = z d4xqg0{l0  v0} ,
s1 = z d4xqg1{l1  v1} ,

(7)

(8)

(9)

where mx is the 5-dimensional planck scale,  is the cosmology constant, and v0,
v1 are the brane tensions. the 5-dimensional einstein equation for the above action
is [2]:

(10)

assuming that there exists a solution that respects 4-dimensional poincare invariance
in the x-directions, one obtains the 5-dimensional metric:

ds2 = e2(y)dxdx + dy2 .

with this metric, the einstein equation reduces to [2]:

(11)

(12)

(13)

before we discuss the phenomenology, we would like to dene the generalized

scale transformation 4 on the 4-dimensional lagrangian:

g  2g ,   1 ,
  3/2 , a  a ,
m  1m , gc  dim[gc] ,

(14)

(15)

(16)

where , , a, m and gc are the scalar eld, spinor eld, gauge eld, mass and
coupling, respectively, and dim[gc] is the mass dimension of the coupling ( for example,
the gauge coupling and yukawa coupling have dimension 0 ). obviously, if  is
not a function of the space-time index, one can easily check that the generalized
scale transformation is invariant even when one considers the gravity, the divergence

4 conformal invariance is a consequence of the scale invariance in quantum eld theory.

4

and renormalization.
it does not change the relative mass ratios, for example, if
we consider the standard model and gravity in 4-dimension, mw /mpl is invariant
under this transformation. although we do not mention it explicitly, this kind of
the transformation will be often used in the following discussion because one need
to consider the physical mass scale in the 4-dimensional minkowski metric from the
5-dimensional fundamental metric by the compactication of the fth dimension. by
the way, we can dene the generalized scale transformation in any dimension.

now, we consider the solution.
(i) assuming  is negative, the rst solution is:

 = |y|s 

6m 3
x

+ c .

(17)

this solution was obtained by randall and sundrum by choosing c=0 [2]. similar to
their result, one can dene a new scale k which relates v0, v1,  to mx as:

v0 = v1 = 6m 3

xk ,  = 6m 3

xk2 .

then, the bulk metric is:

ds2 = e2k|y|2cdxdx + dy2 .

the corresponding 4-dimensional planck scale is:

m 2

pl =

xe2c
m 3
k

[1  e2kl] .

(18)

(19)

(20)

we assume that the observable brane is m1, and in the 5-dimensional fundamental
metric, the gut scale m (5)
gu t of our world is equal to the planck scale mx. we obtain
our world 4-dimensional gut scale

mgu t = m (5)

gu t eklc = mxeklc ,

and the 4-dimensional planck scale and gut scale relation

m 2

pl =

m 3

gu t e+3kl+c

k

[1  e2kl] .

(21)

(22)

we can push mgu t to the tev scale or 105 gev easily. assuming that in the
fundamental theory we just have one scale, l1 should be close to the mx. because
kl can not be arbitrarily large 5, we choose k = mx for the simplicity and obtain:

5for kl is small, the physical results are similar to those in previous extra dimension proposal [1],

gu t e2kl[1  e2kl] .

(23)

m 2

pl = m 2

so, we will not discuss it here.

5

with kl = 34.5 and 30, we can have mgu t at the tev scale and 105 gev scale
respectively. for c=0 and k = mx, we obtain mx = mpl. for c = kl/2 and
k = mx, we obtain that for mgu t = 103 gev and 105 gev, mx is about 1010 gev
and 1011 gev, respectively. and for c = kl, we obtain mx = mgu t . in short, for
c 6= 0, the physical scale picture is dierent from that in ref. [2,3]. and the result in
ref.[2] is not the most general solution to the gauge hierarchy problem in our world.
one can also consider the cosmology constant and brane tensions in the 4-

dimensional minkowski metric, they are:

(4) = 

3m 6

gu t e6kl
m 2
pl

(1  e2kl)(1  e4kl) ,

v (4)
0 =

6m 6

gu t e6kl
m 2
pl

(1  e2kl) ,

v (4)
1 = 

6m 6

gu t e2kl
m 2
pl

(1  e2kl) .

(24)

(25)

(26)

because mgu t can not be smaller than tev scale, each of above values is much larger
than 1058 gev 4.

for above case, the m1 brane tension is negative (although it is not ruled out),
and the space is compact. now, we consider the case similar to that in the ref. [3].
there is just one positive tension brane which is located at the origin and the fth
dimension is innity. the solution of the metric can be written as:

ds2 = e2k|y|2cdxdx + dy2 ,

(27)

which is similar to the above case, and k is dened as before. the scale relations are:

m 2

pl =

xe2c
m 3
k

,

mgu t = mxec ,

m 2

pl =

m 3

gu t ec
k

.

(28)

(29)

(30)

in this case, because the fth dimension is not compactied, we do not require that
6. we can push mgu t to tev or 105 gev scale by choosing ec k=1027
k  mx
gev and 1021 gev. taking c=0, mx=mgu t , and in general, mx might be any
number. in order not to be ruled out by experiment, we might require that eck >

6 one may think there exists hierarchy between k and mx in 5-dimensional fundamental metric
which is not gauge hierarchy, but, k is related to the cosmology constant and small k may ameliorate
the cosmology constant problem, which can be considered as the motivation of small k.

6

1013 gev. choosing c=0 and k = 1013 gev, we obtain mgu t = mx  108
gev, and mgu t /mw  mtop/melectron, so, the hierarchy is not too severe. however,
we can not obtain small enough cosmology constant in this scenario too, for the
cosmology constant and the brane tension in the 4-dimensional minkowski metric
can be expressed as:

(4) = 

gu t

3m 6
m 2
pl

, v (4)

0 =

gu t

6m 6
m 2
pl

.

(31)

the results in ref.[4] can also be applied here. assuming the brane at the

orgin as a hidden brane, and our world locates at y0, we obtain the scale relations

mh = mxec , mgu t = mxek|y0|c ,

m 2

pl =

h ec
m 3
k

, m 2

pl =

m 3

gu t e3k|y0|+c

k

,

(32)

(33)

where the mh is the 4-dimensional gut scale on the hidden brane, and we have
assumed that the 5-dimensional gut scale m (5)
h on the hidden brane is equal to
the 5-dimensional planck scale, i. e., m (5)
h = mx. one can easily solve the gauge
hierarchy problem in our world by varying y0 or c.

in addition, in 4-dimensional minkowski metric, the cosmology constant (4)

is:

(4) = 

3m 6

gu t e6k|y0|
m 2
pl

.

(34)

in short, the general physical scale picture is the following:

therefore, the larger the |y0|, the larger the magnitude of the (4) for xed mgu t .
we can not explain why the cosmology constant is so small, too.
in 5-dimension,
the gut scale on each brane is the same as the planck scale, but, in 4-dimension,
the planck scale is generated from the our world low gut scale exponentially. the
4-dimensional gut scales and planck scale are related to the 5-dimensional gut
scales and planck scale by exponential factors, respectively. in addition, if the fth
dimension is not compact, there is a hidden brane with positive tension at the origin,
the 4-dimensional gut scale mh on the hidden brane is larger than or the same as
that of our world. we live on a brane separated from the hidden brane a distance
about ln(mh /mgu t )/k along the fth dimension where k is not necessary to be equal
to the 5-dimensional planck scale for the fth dimension is not compact.

(ii) assuming  is negative, the other solution is:

 = |y|s 

6m 3
x

+ c .

(35)

similar to the previously result, we can dene a new scale k which relates v0, v1,  to
mx as:

(36)

 v0 = v1 = 6m 3

xk2 .

xk ,  = 6m 3
7

and then, the bulk metric is

ds2 = e2k|y|2cdxdx + dy2 .

the planck scale in the four-dimensional minkowski metric is:

m 2

pl =

xe2c
m 3
k

[e2kl  1] .

(37)

(38)

we assume that the brane of our world is m0. using similar ansatz as above, we
obtain our world 4-dimensional gut scale, and the relation between mpl and mgu t

mgu t = m (5)

gu t ec = mxec ,

m 2

pl =

m 3

gu t e2kl+c

k

[1  e2kl] .

(39)

(40)

we can push mgu t to the tev scale or 105 gev scale easily. taking k = mx for the
fth dimension is compact in this case, we obtain

m 2

pl = m 2

gu t e2kl[1  e2kl] .

(41)

as before, with kl = 34.5 and 30, we can have the mgu t at the tev scale and 105
gev scale, respectively. but, one should notice that, in this scenario, if we take c=0,
we will not rescale the mass scale in the standard model from the 5-dimensional metric
to the 4-dimensional metric, but we rescale the planck scale, the large 4-dimensional
planck scale is generated from the low 5-dimensional planck scale exponentially.

for c=0 and k = mx, we obtain mx = mgu t . for c = kl/2 and k = mx,
we obtain that for mgu t = 103 gev and 105 gev, mx is about 1010 gev and 1011
gev, respectively.

one can also consider the cosmology constant and brane tensions in the 4-

dimensional minkowski metric, they are:

(4) = 

3m 6

gu t e6kl
m 2
pl

(1  e2kl)(1  e4kl) ,

v (4)
0 = 

6m 6

gu t e2kl
m 2
pl

(1  e2kl) ,

v (4)
1 =

6m 6

gu t e6kl
m 2
pl

(1  e2kl) .

(42)

(43)

(44)

obviosly, because mgu t can not be smaller than tev scale, each of those values is
much larger than 1058 gev 4.

furthermore, this solution is related to the rst solution by the following trns-

formation: c  c + kl and v0  v1.

3 compactication on ads5 space

in all the solutions of above section, the space is a slice of ads5 space, therefore, we
can consider the compactication on the ads5 space. the ads5 metric is:

ds2 =

r2
r2

dxdx +

r2
r2 dr2 ,
(45)
ads = 4gn for type iib string
where rads is the radiusof ads5 space, and r2
on ads5  s5 [17] ( we do not write down the metric on s5). obviously, there exists
singularity when r is 0 or innity.
in order to be easy to compare with results of the previous section, we make

ads

ads

the following transformation

r = radsey/rads .

then, the ads5 metric becomes:

this metric is invariant under the following transformation:

ds2 = e2y/radsdxdx + dy2 .

x  e/radsx , y  y +  .

assuming that the minimum and maximum of y are a and b which can be considered
as cut-os, and the brane of our world is located at yo where a  yo  b 7, we obtain
the following scale relations:

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

m 2

pl =

m 3

xrads
2

mgu t = m (5)

m 3

gu t rads

m 2

pl =

2

e2b/rads(1  e2(ba)/rads ) ,
gu t eyo/rads = mxeyo/rads ,
e(2b3yo)/rads(1  e2(ba)/rads) .
x , and obtain

if a and b are nite, we can assume that rads = m 1

m 2

pl =

m 2
gu t
2

e2(byo)/rads(1  e2(ba)/rads) .

with 2(b  yo)/rads = 34.5 and 30, we can push mgu t to the tev scale and 105
gev scale, respectively. but, one should notice that, if yo = 0, we will not rescale the
mass scale in the standard model, which is dierent from previous result [2]. if a is
negative innity, the physical scale picture will be similar to that in the rst solution
with non-compact fth dimension in above section, with c = b/rads.
in above section, the rst solution with compact fth dimension can be con-
sidered as a = yo = b l and c = b/rads, and the scond solution can be considered
as a = yo = b  l and c = a/rads by noticing that k = r1
ads. of course, the value
of a might be negative innity, the result in the rst solution with non-compact fth
dimension can be considered as c = b/rads.

7 we do not address the issue of determining the locations of the branes here.
