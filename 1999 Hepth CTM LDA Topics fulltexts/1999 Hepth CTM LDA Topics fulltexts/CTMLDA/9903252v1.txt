this talk gives an introduction into the subject of seiberg-witten curves and their relation to
integrable systems. we discuss some motivations and origins of this relation and consider explicit
construction of various families of seiberg-witten curves in terms of corresponding integrable models.

introduction

some time has been already passed after the observation of [1] that the eective theories for n = 2 vector
supermultiplets [2, 3, 4] can be reformulated in terms of integrable systems. this connection, though not been
clearly understood so far, has become already a beautiful example of appearance of hidden integrable structure
in (multi-dimensional) quantum gauge theories and, thus, quite a popular topic at many dierent conferences.
in this talk i was asked to review basic known facts of this relation and, in addition to brief explanation of some
clear constituents of this correspondence, to present a list of problems which deserve further investigation.

the formulation of the seiberg-witten (sw) solution [2, 3] itself is very simple: the (coulomb branch)
low-energy eective action for the 4d n = 2 susy yang-mills vector multiplets (supersymmetry requires the
metric on moduli space of massless complex scalars from n = 2 vector supermultiplets to be of special kahler
should be expressed through a holomorphic function
f = f (a)  a prepotential) can be described in terms of auxiliary riemann surface (complex curve)  equipped
with meromorphic 1-dierential ds, possessing peculiar properties:

 the number of live moduli (of complex structure) of  is strongly restricted (roughly 3 times less
than for generic riemann surface). the genus of  for the su (n ) gauge theories is exactly equal 3 to the
rank of gauge group  i.e. to the number of independent moduli.

3for generic gauge groups one should speak instead of genus  the dimension of jacobian of a spectral curve  about the
dimension of prym variety. practically it means that for other than an -type gauge theories one should consider the spectral
curves with involution and only the invariant under the involution cycles possess physical meaning. we consider in detail only
the an theories, the generalization to the other gauge groups is straightforward: for example, instead of periodic toda chains [5],
corresponding to an theories [1], one has to consider the generalized toda chains [6], rst introduced for dierent lie-algebraic
series (b, c, d, e, f and g) in [7].

these data mean that the eective sw theory is formulated in terms of a classical nite-gap integrable
system (see, for example, [12] and references therein) and their whitham deformations [1]. the corresponding
integrable models are well-known members of the kp/toda family  for example, pure gauge theory corresponds
to a periodic toda chain [1, 6], the theories with broken n = 4 susy by the adjoint mass can be formulated
in terms of the elliptic calogero-moser models [8], the theories with extra compact dimension (or kaluza-klein
modes) give rise to appearance of relativistic integrable systems [9, 10, 11].

the aim of this talk is rather modest  to give some argumentation in favour of appearance of complex
curves  in the context of susy gauge theories and to present in clear way how the form of these curves can
be explicitly found in by means of lax representations of well-known nite-dimensional integrable systems. i
should stress that the curves  (and correspondent integrable systems) are auxiliary from physical point of
view since the quantities (1), (2) eective theories needs depend only on moduli of sw curve or only on half of
the variables of classical integrable system. this dependence is governed by integrable systems which are, in
a sense, derivative from those we are going to consider below  the hierarchies of whitham and (generalized)
associativity equations. both these subjects are, however, beyond the scope of these notes.

2 motivations and origins

in spite of absence at the moment any consistent and full explanations why the sw curves are identical to the
curves of integrable systems, let us start from some physical motivations. we consider, rst, the perturbative
limit of n = 2 susy gauge theories and show that (degenerate) spectral curves and corresponding integrable
systems appear already at this level. the situation is much more complicated for the non-perturbative picture
and the only way to explain the origin of full sw curve exists in the framework of non-perturbative string
theory or m-theory. in the second part of this section we shall discuss briey how the lax representations of
the sw spectral curves arise in this context.

2.1 perturbative spectral curves

amazingly enough the relation between sw theories and integrable systems can be discussed already at the
perturbative level, where n = 2 susy eective actions are completely dened by the 1-loop contributions (see
[2] and references therein). the scalar eld  = kijk of n = 2 vector supermultiplet acquires nonzero vev
 = diag(1, . . . , n ) and the masses of particles  w -bosons and their superpartners are proportional to
ij = i  j due to the higgs term [a, ]ij = aij
 (i  j) in the susy yang-mills action. these masses can
be written altogether in terms of the generating polynomial

(  the adjoint complex scalar, tr = 0,) via residue formula

w = pn () = det(  ) =y(  i)
mij icij

d log w =icij

d log pn ()

(3)

(4)

which for a particular -like contour cij around the roots  = i and  = j gives rise to the higgs masses.
the contour integral (4) is dened on a complex plane  -plane with n removed points: the roots of the
polynomial (3)  a degenerate riemann surface. the masses of monopoles are naively innite in this limit,
since the corresponding contours (dual to cij) start and end in the points where ds obeys pole singularities. it
means that the monopole masses, proportional to the squared inverse coupling, are renormalized in perturbation
theory and dened naively up to the masses of particle states times some divergent constants.

the eective action (the prepotential) f , or the set of eective charges tij (2), are dened in n = 2

perturbation theory by 1-loop diagram giving rise to the logarithmic contribution

(cid:0)2f(cid:1)ij = tij  xmasses

where   qcd and last equality is written only for pure gauge theories  since the only masses we have there
are the higgs masses (4). that is all one has in the perturbative weak-coupling limit of the sw construction,
when the instanton contributions to the prepotential (being proportional to the degrees of 2n (or q2n  e2i n
 in the uv-nite theories with bare coupling  ) are (exponentially) suppressed so that one keeps only the
terms proportional to  or log . we shall list several more examples below and demonstrate that these
degenerated rational spectral curves can be already related to the family of trigonometric ruijsenaars-schneider
and calogero-moser-sutherland systems and the open toda chain or toda molecule.

start with the original case of su (2) pure gauge theory. eq. (3) turns into

w = 2  u

(6)

with u = 1
written as

2 tr2. in the parameterization of [2] x = w = ez = 2  u, y = w the same equation can be
(7)

y 2 = x 2(x + u)

and the masses (4) are now dened by the contour integrals of

ds = d log w = 2

(8)

one can easily notice that eqs. (6), (7) and (8) can be interpreted as integration of the open sl(2) (the liouville)
toda chain with the co-ordinate x = w = eq, momentum p =  and hamiltonian (energy) u. the integration of
generating dierential ds = pdq over the trajectories of the particles gives rise, in fact, to the monopole masses
in the sw theory.

this is actually a general rule  the perturbative n = 2 theories of the sw family give rise to the open
or trigonometric family of integrable systems  the open toda chain, the trigonometric calogero-moser or
ruijsenaars-schneider systems. this can be easily established at the level of spectrum (4) and the eective
couplings (5)  the corresponding (rational) curves are (3) in the n -particle toda chain case

and contain in addition to the higgs part ij the kaluza-klein (kk) modes n

with shifted by  boundary conditions. the  parameter can be treated as a wilson loop of gauge eld along
the compact dimension  a kind of dierent (or dual) moduli in the theory and in a subclass of models it plays
the role of the mass of the adjoint matter multiplet.

2.2 nonperturbative sw curves, m-theory and -equation

as an example, let us consider, rst, the case of pure su (2) n = 2 gauge theory [2]. the gauge group has
rank 1 and from the integrable point of view the situation is trivial, since the correspondent integrable model
is one-dimensional (phase space has dimension two) and this case can be always solved explicitly. the full
(blown-up) spectral curve has the form

(cf. with (3)) and coincides with the equation relating the hamiltonian (energy) u with the co-ordinate z = iq
(or z = q) and momentum  = p of a particle moving into the sl(2) toda-chain potential  the well-known

parameterizations of the su (2) sw curve: the rst one was proposed in original paper [2]

with ds = (x + h) dx

y 2 = (x 2  44)(x + u)

y = y

phases are the periods

(18)

in the sin-phase if u >> 2 the interaction is inessential and, the main eect for the integral (18) comes from

in another phase, corresponding to imaginary values of q (q  iq + ) the action integral (18) turns into

where we by q we have denoted the turning point 2eq = u. it is easy to see that the expressions (19) and
(21) give the perturbative values of the w-boson m2

(22)

this is an obvious perturbative (1-loop) result of n = 2 susy yang-mills theory. the main hypothesis of [2]
is that formulas (18) (and the prepotential or the set of coupling constants they dene) are valid beyond the
perturbation theory. in this case the r.h.s. of (22) would contain an innite instanton series (in 4
u2 for the
su (2) gauge group) but this can be encoded into a relatively simple modication of sw curves.

in the construction inspired by m-theory moduli arise either as positions of the d-branes i  |ri|
monodromies of the gauge elds  =h am dxm along the compactied directions (and are related to the positions

of branes by t-duality), i.e. they are given by the set of data (am , (i)). the perturbative spectral curves (6),
(9), (10) correspond in this picture to the p-branes (p-dimensional hypersurfaces with the (p + 1)-dimensional

world volume) with the d(p 1)-brane sources [15]. in particular case when the conguration can be described
by two real (or one complex component) of both kind of elds ( a, ) one can dene the full (smooth) spectral
curves g as a cover of some bare spectral curve 0  usually a torus, which can be naturally chosen when one
has at least two compactied dimensions  by generalization of the equation (3)

where  = (z) is now function (in fact 1-dierential) on bare curve 0 and obeys [13, 14]

det(  (z)) = 0

j ()(2)(p  p)

is holomorphic in the complex structure determined by a. the invariants of a can be thought of as
i.e.
co-ordinates (one commuting set of variables) while the invariants of  as hamiltonians (another commuting
set of variables) of an integrable system.
it means that m-theory point of view implies that the vev 
becomes a function on some base spectral curve 0  usually a cylinder or torus, appearing as a part of the
(compactied) brane world volume and satises -equation. such holomorphic (or, better, meromorphic) objects
were introduced long ago [12] as lax operators for the nite-dimensional integrable systems, holomorphically
depending on some spectral parameter.

the (rst-order) equation (24) arises from the bps-like condition [16, 17] of the type q = m dm  +
mn fmn = 0 which determines the form of the lax operator  and, thus, the shape of the curve (23). on
torus with p marked points z1, . . . , zp can be dened by (i, j = 1, . . . , n )

the functions fk(z) will have poles at z1, . . . , zp of the order not bigger than l. the generating dierential, as
usual, should be

and its residues in the marked points (z, (i)(z)) (dierent i correspond to the choice of dierent sheets of
the covering surface) are related with the mass parameters (29) by

m = reszdz 

nxi=1

(i)(z)dz = resztrdz

(33)

we shall see that general form of the curve (30) coincides with the general curves arising in the sw theory (in
many important cases torus should degenerate into a cylinder). for example, the p = 1, l = 1 case gives rise to
the elliptic calogero-moser model (see eq. (56) below).

thus, in the m-theory picture it becomes clear that full non-perturbative sw curves are smooth analogues
of their degenerate perturbative cousins. this blowing up corresponds to the massive deformation of previous
family of integrable systems, or, more strictly, the non-perturbative sw curves correspond to the family of
periodic toda chains [5] and calogero-moser-ruijsenaars [25, 26, 27, 28] integrable models.

3 zoo of curves and integrable systems

now let us turn to the question of the zoo of sws integrable systems  or some classication of relations between
the susy ym theories and corresponding integrable models. we shall consider the cases of broken n = 4 susy
theories, or n = 2 susy yang-mills with extra adjoint matter multiplets, theories with soft kaluza-klein (kk)
modes or with extra 5th compact dimension and, as a separate question, theories with fundamental matter (all
with the su (n ) gauge group). the last issue is relatively less investigated yet, i.e. there still exist some open
problems, mostly related with the conformal case nf = 2n . two rst classes instead can be formulated in a
unique way since there exists a unifying integrable system  the elliptic ruijsenaars-schneider model [27, 28]
(with bare coupling  , relativistic parameter r  the radius of compact dimension and an extra parameter 
 see (11)), giving rise to all known models of these two classes in its various degenerations [11]:

 if r  0 (with nite ) the mass spectrum (11) reduces to a single point m = 0, i.e. all masses arise
only due to the higgs eect. this is the standard four dimensional n = 2 susy ym model associated
with the periodic toda chain. in this situation n = 2 susy in four dimensions is insucient to ensure
uv-niteness, thus bare coupling diverges   i, but the dimensional transmutation substitutes the
dimensionless  by the new dimensionful (and nite) parameter n = e2i (/r)n .

 if r  0 and   mr for nite m, then uv niteness is preserved. the mass spectrum reduces to
the two points m = 0 and m = m. this is the four dimensional ym model with n = 4 susy softly
broken to n = 2. the associated nite-dimensional integrable system [8] is the elliptic calogero-moser
model [25, 26]. the previous case is then obtained by inosemtsevs [29] double scaling limit when m  0,
  i and n = mn e2i is xed.

 if r 6= 0 but   i the mass spectrum reduces to a single kaluza-klein tower, m = n/r, n  z. this
compactication of the ve dimensional model has n = 1 susy and is not uv-nite. here   i and
  i, such that 2  n  remains nite. the corresponding integrable system [9] is the relativistic
toda chain [30].

 finally, when r 6= 0 and  and  are both nite one distinguished case still remains:  = /2.6 here only
periodic and anti periodic boundary conditions occur in the compact dimension. this is the case analyzed
in [10, 11] and interested reader can nd all details there.

3.1 toda chain

this is the most well-known example of su (n ) pure gauge theory [4]. the spectral curve is

6the case  = 0 of fully unbroken ve dimensional n = 2 supersymmetry is of course also distinguished, but trivial: there is
no evolution of eective couplings (renormalization group ows) and the integrable system is just that of n non-interacting (free)
particles.

(36)

the spectral curve (34) corresponds to periodic n -particle problem in toda chain [19, 20]. let us demonstrate
now how its form can be derived in the language of integrable systems using two dierent forms of the lax
representation with spectral parameter for periodic toda chain.

the toda chain system [5, 21] is a system of particles with only the neighbors pairwise exponential interaction

with the equations of motion 7

(37)

where one assumes (for the periodic problem with the period n ) that qi+n = qi and pi+n = pi. it is an

integrable system, with n poisson-commuting hamiltonians, h1 = p pi = p, h2 = p(cid:0) 1

etc. starting from naively innite-dimensional system of particles (37), the periodic problem can be formulated
in terms of (the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of) two commuting operators: the lax operator l (or the
auxiliary linear problem for (37) 8)

and the second operator  in our case of periodic boundary conditions to be chosen as a monodromy or shift

(40)

(41)

means that there is a relation between them p(l, t ) = 0 which can be strictly formulated in terms of spectral
curve [22] : p(, w) = 0. here is an important dierence with the perturbative case considered above, where
only one (lax) operator was really dened and there was no analog of the second t -operator. the generation
function for the integrals of motion  the toda chain hamiltonians can be written in terms of l and t operators
and toda chains possess two dierent (though, of course, equivalent) formulations of this kind.

in the rst version the lax operator (39) should be re-written in the basis of the t -operator eigenfunctions

7for simplicity in this section we consider a periodic toda chain with coupling constant equal to unity. it is easy to restore it
in all the equations; then it becomes clear that it should be identied with  = qcd  the scale parameter of pure n = 2 susy
yang-mills theory.
8equation (39) is the second-order dierence equation and it has two independent solutions which we shall often denote below
as + and . in more general framework of the toda lattice hierarchy these two solutions correspond to the two possible choices
of sign in the time-dependent form of the lax equation (39)

9let us point out that we consider a periodic problem for the toda chain when only the ba function can acquire a nontrivial
factor under the action of the shift operator while the coordinates and momenta themselves are periodic. the quasiperiodicity of
coordinates and momenta  when they acquire a nonzero shift  corresponds to the change of the coupling constant in the toda
chain hamiltonians.

3.2 broken n=4 susy and the elliptic calogero-moser model

both go to innity and

[(i  j) log m + (qi  qj)]

(61)

so that the dimensionless coupling  gets substituted by a dimensionful parameter n  mn ei . the idea
is to separate the pairwise interacting particles far away from each other and to adjust the coupling constant
simultaneously in such a way, that the interaction only of neighboring particles survives (and turns to be
exponential). in this limit, the elliptic curve degenerates into a cylinder with coordinate w = ezei so that

the lax operator of the calogero system turns into that of the n -periodic toda chain (42):

(63)

and the spectral curve acquires the form (43). in the simplest example of n = 2 the spectral curve cm has
genus 2. indeed, in this particular case, eq. (58) turns into

this equation says that with any value of x one associates two points of cm

p(; x, y) = 2  u + m2x = 0

 = pu  m2x

i.e. it describes cm as a double covering of elliptic curve ramied at the points x = u
m2 and x = . in fact,
x = u
m2 corresponds to a pair of points on e( ) distinguished by the sign of y. this would be true for x = 
as well, but x =  is one of the branch points, thus, two cuts between x = u
m2 and x =  on every sheet
of e( ) touching at the common end at x =  become eectively a single cut between(cid:0) u
therefore, we can consider the spectral curve cm as two tori e( ) glued along one cut, i.e. cm
n =2 has genus 2.
it turns out to be a hyperelliptic curve (for n = 2 only!) after substituting in (64) x from the second equation
to the rst one.

11let us point out that the curve (58) has genus g = n (while in general the genus of the curve dened by n  n matrix grows
as n 2). however, integrable system is still 2(n  1)-dimensional since the sum of the periods of (60) vanishes due to specic
properties of dz and there are only n  1 = g  1 independent integrals of motion.

dierent parity with respect to the z2  z2 symmetry of cm : y  y,    and dv  dv. since
ds has certain (positive) parity, its integrals along the two of four elementary non-contractable cycles on cm
automatically vanish leaving only two non-vanishing quantities a and ad, as necessary for the 4d interpretation.
moreover, two rest nonzero periods can be dened in terms of the reduced curve of genus g = 1

3.3 relativistic toda chain and the ruijsenaars-schneider model

so far we have considered the theories with only the higgs and adjoint matter contribution to the spectrum
(11). if, however, one adds also the soft kk modes [9], the resulting integrable systems would correspond to the
ruijsenaars-schneider family [27, 28, 30], which is often called as the family of relativistic integrable models.
the 1-loop contributions to the eective charge (5) are now of the form

tij xm

log(cid:18)aij +

m

r5(cid:19)  logym

(r5aij + m)  log sinh (r5aij)

(71)

i.e. coming from 4d up to 5d one should make a trigonometric substitution a  sinh ar5, at least, in the
formulas for the perturbative prepotential. the similar change of variables corresponds to relativization of
integrable systems, which implies a sort of lie group generalization of the ordinary integrable systems
related rather to lie algebras. the relativization of an integrable system replaces the momenta of particles by
their exponentials and it results in the period matrices or eective charges of the (71) form. for example, in
the case of su (2) pure gauge theory it gives instead of hamiltonian of the toda chain (12)

cosh z = cosh p  h

(72)

generally, the net result is that in the case of relativistic toda chain the spectral curve is a minor modication
of (52)

w +

= (5)n/2 p (),

w

w(cid:1)
which can be again rewritten as a hyperelliptic curve in terms of the new variable y  (5)n/2(cid:0)w  1

12this curve can be obtained by simple integration of the equations of motion since we again here deal with the only degree of

freedom in our integrable system. the conserving energy u = p2 + m2(q) gives

where   2  e2,  can be chosen as a spectral parameter of the relativistic toda chain and 5 is its coupling
constant.

the most general picture in these terms corresponds to the unifying elliptic ruijsenaars-schneider model

[9, 11]. the lax operator for the elliptic ruijsenaars model is[28]

ij = epi (qij + z)()
lr
(qij + )(z)
epi = epiyk6=ip()  (qik),

and in the trigonometric limit it turns into

ij = epi sinh(qij + z) sinh()

epi = epiyk6=is1

only the leading term in (77) is often taken as an expression for the lax operator of trigonometric ruijsenaars
system. the elliptic ruijsenaars spectral curve acquires the form [28, 11]

k(z)k(k1)()

(d0(z|) = 1 and d1(z|) = 1), and the generating dierential is

ds = log dz

in the simplest case of 1 degree of freedom (n = 2) eq. (78) reads

2  u + d2(z|) = 2  u 

(z  )(z + )

2(z)2()

= 2  u + (z)  () = 0

(78)

(79)

(80)

(81)

and one gets a spectral curve identical to (64). the same sort of arguments as for the elliptic calogero-moser
model shows that its full genus is g = 2 while the sl(2) integrable system lives eectively on reduced spectral
curve of genus one. in trigonometric limit (76), (77) the spectral curve (78) turns into (10). an interested
reader can nd the details concerning various limits of the ruijsenaars-schneider model in [11].

3.4 fundamental matter

let us turn, nally, to the case of susy qcd  the sw theories with matter multiplets in the lowest dimensional
representations of the gauge group. according to [3, 31] the spectral curves for n = 2 sqcd with gauge group
13in [11] we have used for technical reasons a slightly dierent form of the ruijsenaars spectral curve, which can be obtained
from eq. (78) substituting   c(z) (or dk(z|)  dk(z|)ck(z)) with some (independent of hamiltonians and ) function c(z).
such substitution does not change the symplectic form d
  dz and playing with such function some particular formulas can be
brought to more simple form.

12

where pnf () and rn 1() are moduli independent polynomials of   i.e. they depend only on external
masses of matter hypermultiplets [31], but spectral curves are still described by hyperelliptic equation.
in
contrast to pure gauge theory one runs immediately into a problem of parameter counting: n  1 moduli
k trk together with nf masses m give n + nf  1 and this is more than hyperelliptic moduli 2g 2 = 2n  4
of the equation (82) for nf > n3. in other words, the moduli space of eq. (82) is too small to be parameterized
by all parameters of the theory, that is why there are some complications in retranslating these models into the
language of integrable systems 14. however, the form (82) immediately implies [32] that for n = 2 sqcd there
should exist a 2  2 representation of the kind (51) with monodromy matrix tn (), whose invariants have the
form

tr tn () = pn ()

det tn () = pnf ()

a natural proposal then is [35] to use a generalization of the 2  2 toda chain lax representation, i.e. to
deform the lax matrix (47) preserving the poisson brackets (48) and (50). the monodromy matrix t () is
again constructed by multiplication of li()s (satisfying (48)) at dierent sites giving rise to the spectral curve
equation

where from t -matrix one has to require (83). wide class of such systems is given by the family of spin chains
and to get most general form of the transfer matrix one should consider the inhomogeneous spin chain 15

det (tn ()  w) = 0

(84)

tn () =

xyn i1

li(  li)

(85)

if lax matrices li() were of the size p p the equation (84) would have the form of p-th degree polynomial in
w, if p = 2 it is exactly the general case of (82) 16

the r.h.s. of the equations (86), (87) contain the dynamical variables of the spin system only in special
combinations  the hamiltonians (which are all in involution, i.e. mutually poisson-commuting or the casimir

14in particular, there are dierent ideas of interpretation of the equation (82) (at least in the case of small nf < n ) in the
context of integrable models, some of them can be found in [32, 33, 34]. we shall consider below, following [35, 37] only one of such
options, which seems, however, to be the most attractive at present since it leads to a family of integrable systems which admits,
for example, as in the case of adjoint matter, inclusion of the kk sector, or natural relativistic generalizations.

15for the toda chain the inhomogenity parameters li are not independent variables  they can be reabsorbed into the denition

of momenta.

16we introduce new variable w =

wdet tn ()

in order to make analytic representation of spectral curve more symmetric. in

the picture of m-theory these redenitions are related with dierent brane pictures of the theories where presence of fundamental
matter multiplets are caused by extra semi-innite branes.

sl(2) rational xxx chain is

l() =   1 +

sa  a.

(89)

3xa=1

and the poisson brackets on the space of the dynamical variables sa, a = 1, 2, 3 are implied by quadratic r-matrix
relations (48) with the same rational r-matrix, as for the toda chain [38].

the r-matrix relations (48) for the lax matrix (89) are equivalent to well-known sl(2) commutation (poisson

bracket) relations

(90)
i.e. vector {sa} plays the role of angular momentum (classical spin) variables giving the name spin-chains to
the whole class of systems. the algebra (90) has an obvious casimir operator (an invariant poisson commuting
with all generators sa),

{sa, sb} = iabcsc,

(93)

determinant of monodromy matrix (92) depends on dynamical variables only through the casimirs ki of the
poisson algebra, and trace pn () = 1
2 tr22tn () generates the hamiltonians or integrals of motion. in the
case of sl(2) xxx spin chains, the spectral equation acquires exactly the form (86) or (87) where the number
of matter multiplets, which determines the degree of polynomials in (83), nf  2n depends on a particular
degeneracy of full chain.

in this picture the rational sl(2) xxx spin chain literally corresponds to a nf < 2n n = 2 susy qcd.
things are not so simple with the conformal nf = 2n case when an additional dimensionless parameter
appears  a naive toric generalization of the xxx-picture leads to the xy z chain with the hamiltonian
structure given by elliptic sklyanin algebra [38]. this model was proposed in [37] as a candidate for integrable
system behind the nf = 2n theory, and, as it was discussed later (see, for example, [39] and references therein),
it should be rather interpreted as a 4d theory with two extra compact dimensions (or a compactied 6d theory)
18. the condition nf = 2n which can be easily broken in 4d and 5d situations is very strict in 6d and one
may think of the corresponding theory as of blowing up all possible compactied dimensions in the nf = 2n
4d theory with vanishing -function.

in general, one nds, that the spectral curves for susy qcd with nf fundamental multiplets (and prepo-
tentials) in 4d, 5d and 6d cases are described by similar formulas [39]. the spectral curves in all cases can be
written in the form

w +

q(d)()

w

= 2p (d)()

(95)

17eq. (93) implies that the limit of vanishing masses, all m

i = 0, is associated with the homogeneous chain (all li = 0) and

vanishing spins at each site (all ki = 0).

i.e. coming from 4d or 5d to d = 6 one should replace the rational (trigonometric) expressions by the elliptic functions, at least,
in the formulas for the perturbative prepotential, the (imaginary part of) modular parameter being identied with the ratio of the
compactication radii r5/r6.

4 conclusion

in this talk i have tried to formulate main issues of the correspondence between the seiberg-witten curves
governing the exact solutions to n = 2 susy gauge theories and integrable systems. during last 4 years there
was a lot of progress in this direction. however, there is still a lot of questions which are not yet understood
and deserve further investigation. let me, nally, point out at least some of them:

 the rst, and the most essential question is still open: how to derive the sw  integrable systems
correspondence from rst principles. there is no clear answer to the question what means the dynamics
governed by an integrable system directly in terms of susy gauge theory.

 the point which seems to be already clear is that sw construction itself becomes much more transparent
from the point of view of non-perturbative string theory or m-theory. however, it is still many open
questions in this direction  for example the m-theory picture of the ruijsenaars-schneider model, double-
elliptic systems etc. it is clear that the ruijsenaars lax operator (75) satises similar to (24) -equation,
but there is no clear interpretation of this equation in terms of d-brane constructions.

15

 i have already mentioned some general problems with fundamental matter. of particular interest is the
conformal nf = 2n case, which should be clearly related, on one hand, with double-elliptic systems and,
on the other hand, with the k3 and elliptic calabi-yau compactications of string and m-theory.

 in this talk only the su (n ) gauge theories were considered in detail. i did not touch at all many problems
related to the generalizations to the other gauge groups and representations. from the point of view of
integrable systems this is a question, in part, about dierent representations of the lax pairs for integrable
systems and it is overlapped, thus, with the problem of dierent lax pairs for the calogero-moser systems
found recently in [40] and [41].
