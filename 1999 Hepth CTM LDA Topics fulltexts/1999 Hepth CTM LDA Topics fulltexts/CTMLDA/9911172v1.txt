abstract

we explicitly show the area law behavior of a circular wilson loop
in conning theories from supergravity. we calculate the correlator
of two wilson loops from supergravity in conning backgrounds. we
nd that it is dominated by an exchange of a scalarball that is
lighter than the glueballs. we interpret these results in terms of the
meson-meson potential in such theories.

1 introduction

in the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] correlation functions of gauge the-
ory operators can be calculated by evaluating the supergravity action on
ads5  s 5 with the gauge theory operators positioned on the boundary of
ads5, acting as a source of supergravity elds. every gauge theory operator
has a corresponding supergravity mode.

the correspondence also holds when probes are introduced in ads5. a
fundamental string with ends on the boundary is one such probe.
it was
shown in [4, 5] that the renormalized classical action of such a string trans-
lates into the expectation value of a wilson loop in the dual gauge theory
picture. apart from the innite strip loop which measures the potential
between a quark-anti-quark pair, stringy computations were also made for
circular loops [6, 7] and loops with cusps [8]. the incorporation of quadratic
quantum corrections to the classical determination of the wilson loops was
addressed in [9, 11, 12].

the string worldsheet acts as a source of supergravity modes just like
the gauge theory operators located on the boundary [2, 3]. in [7, 13, 14, 15]
the supergravity action on ads5  s 5 was calculated in the presence of such
a string worldsheet in order to get the expectation value of some operator
o(x) in the presence of an external quark or a quark-anti-quark system.
the action was calculated by considering the exchange of the corresponding
supergravity mode from the worldsheet to the boundary point x.

the wilson loop ope and the correlation of two loops were calculated
using the same method [7]. it was shown in [6, 17] that there is a solution
of the string equation of motion that describes a surface that ends on two
circles. this solution is stable only when the distance between the two loops
is of the order of their radius. for longer distances the connecting world
sheet degenerates into a thin tube [6].

a natural question raised immediately after the evaluation of the wil-
son loop of the n = 4 sym theory, was how to extend these results to
non-supersymmetric gauge dynamics. witten [18] proposed to describe such
theories using the near extremal solution, in the limit of zero radius of the
compact euclidean time direction combined with anti-periodic boundary con-
ditions. this scenario renders the gauginos and adjoint scalars into very
massive elds and hence resembles the pure ym theory. this approach was
utilized to determine the behavior of the quark anti-quark potential for the

1

n = 4 theory at nite temperature [24, 25] and the pure ym theory in
three dimensions [23]. later, a similar procedure was invoked to compute
wilson loops of four dimensional ym theory, t hooft loops [23, 6], the po-
tential in mqcd and in polyakovs type 0 model [19, 20, 21].

in [21] a unied scheme for such models was introduced and a theorem,
that determines the leading and next to leading behavior, was proven and
applied to several models. in particular a corollary of this theorem states the
sucient conditions for the potential to have a conning nature. conning
wilson loops were also discussed in [10, 22].

the purpose of this paper is to analyze the two point function of wilson
loops associated with supergravity backgrounds that correspond to the large
n limit of non supersymmetric conning gauge theories. to achieve this
goal we combine the approach of [7] with the recipe of [18]. the two point
function of innite strip wilson loops translates into the interaction potential
between mesons composed of heavy quarks in three dimensions. we nd that
the potential has the expected dependence on n and that it corresponds to
an exchange of a scalarball which is lighter than the glueball. a similar
approach can also be applied to determine the potential between baryons.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we review the case of an
innite strip wilson loops in the background of an ads5 black hole, and
calculate the circular wilson loop area element. we explicitly show the area
law in the circular case, and get the same string tension as in the strip case.
in section 3 we calculate the correlation of two wilson loops. we show that
there are contributions from states lighter than the glueball states of ym3
[29] indicating that the associated eld theory dual is not pure ym theory
in three dimensions. in section 4 we comment about extending the results
to systems that include baryons. the results are summarized in section 5.

2 circular wilson loops

we start with a calculation of the area elements of circular wilson loops in
the background of n near extremal d3 branes, also known as the ads black
hole background [18].

the time coordinate is compactied on a circle of radius 1/t . we will con-
sider wilson loops in the x12 plane, and constant  on the s 5. in order to
make the equations simpler we shall use z = 1/u, and rescale the coordinates
as follows

where zmax is highest point in the worldsheet, and zt = (r2t )1. the

ads5 corresponds to  = 0. the dilaton is independent of  and z.

innite strip wilson loops have been thoroughly investigated in this back-
ground [23, 25, 21, 26]. the worldsheet area element for a loop in the x-y
plane is given by

where dy is one of the spatial directions in the metric.

circular wilson loops can be calculated using similar methods.

in an
ads5 background circular wilson loops have been investigated in [7, 6, 8].
by using the conformal symmetry on the boundary of ads5 one can transform
a wilson line into a circle, thus getting a simple analytic expression for the
area of such a loop.

in non conformal cases, such as in the background of n near extremal d3
branes, one must use the standard approach [23, 25]. our interest is circular
loops in the x  y plane. we shall write dxdy as rdrd, and the integrand is
the same as in the innite strip case. the action gives the expression for the
radius of the worldsheet as a function of z [18, 25]

r(z) = z 1

z

z2dz

1  z41  z4

(5)

the dierence in the circular case is that the boundary condition is r(0) = a,
where a is the radius of the loop. the area element of the worldsheet is given
by

da =

1


r(z)dz

z21  z41  z4

3

(6)

when integrating this area element the divergent part is proportional to the
circumference of the loop and is subtracted to get a nite area. it can be seen
that upon setting  = 0, which is the extremal case, we get that the area is
independent of the radius as was pointed out in [7]. in the limit   1 the
dominant contribution to the area will be from z = 1, where we can write

da =

1


r(z)dr(z)

(7)

this gives the area law for circular loops s = a2/2. rescaling back the
coordinates we get ( = 1)

s =

1
2

r2t 2sb

(8)

where sb = a2 is the area of the loop on the boundary. a similar expression
was found in [23] for the connection between the energy and separation of a
quark anti-quark system from the strip loop.

for a general metric the action will be of the general form

s =

1

 z rdrqf 2(z) + g2(z)(z)2

(9)

with the boundary condition that the highest point in the worldsheet is z = 1.
in this case the circular loop will have the following radius, and area

dz

z

r(z) = z 1
da =

1


g(z)/f (z)

r(z)g(z)f (z)

qf (z)2/f 2(1)  1
f (1)qf (z)2/f 2(1)  1

(10)

it can be seen that if g(z) is singular at z = 1, then the dominant contribution
to the radius will come from z = 1. thus we can write s as

s =

1

 z f (1)r(z)dr(z) =

f (1)a2

2

(11)

in which case the area law behavior is evident. in case g(z) is not singular
in the 0 < z < 1 interval, but f (z) has a minimum at z = 1, the integrals in
(10) are still dominated by the contribution at z = 1. the leading behavior
will still be an area law for f (1) > 0.

3 wilson loops correlators

it was shown by [13, 6] that when the separation of the two loops in ads5
is of the order of their size, there is a solution of the string equation of
motion that describes a connected surface ending on the two loops (g.1a).
as the separation increases the tube shrinks, and becomes unstable. at large
distances the correlation is due the exchange of supergravity modes in the
bulk between the worldsheets of the loops.

the long distance correlation of two circular loops was calculated in [7]
for the n = 4 sym theory. the long distance correlation is given by the
exchange of light supergravity modes in the bulk of ads5 that couple to the
worldsheet of the wilson loops (g.1b).
it seems plausible that the same

picture would hold for other backgrounds that have eld theory duals. in
this note we are interested in the background created by n near extremal
d3 branes.

starting with ten dimensional supergravity compactied on w  s 5 we

may write the ten dimensional elds as

kyk,i

 = xk,i

(12)

where k,i is a ve dimensional eld, and yk,i are the spherical harmonics
on s 5 with total angular momentum k. the spectrum of ten dimensional
supergravity compactied on s 5 was investigated in [27, 28]. in what follows
we will concentrate only on the dilaton, k, and sk, which is a linear combi-
nation of the trace of the metric on s 5 and the 4-form. these elds have the
following ve dimensional masses

k m2
sk m2

 = k(k + 4) k  0
s = k(k  4) k  2

5

(13)

note that the eld sk has for k = 2, 3 a negative m2. however, these modes
are not tachyonic, since they propagate on a space of negative curvature.

the general form of the correlation is obtained by integrating on the
worldsheets the amplitude for the exchange of a supergravity mode in the
bulk between points on the worldsheets, and then summing over all modes
that can be exchanged [7].

y 2

2 gi,k

(14)

1 , f i,k

where f i,k
2 are the couplings of the eld i to the worldsheet (in general
they can be functions of z), k is the momentum on s 5, and gi,k is the
propagator. the sum on i follows simply from the properties of spherical
harmonic on s 5 [32].

we can read o the n, and gsn dependence of the correlation. the
propagator derived from the supergravity action will be of order 2  4g2
s .
with our choice of units, and the factor of 2 coming from the worldsheet
area elements, the amplitude will be of order 2g2

s = gsn/n 2.

to get the leading contribution we shall consider only the lowest ks
possible for each eld. note that the long distance correlation given by
(14) does not depend on the relative orientation of the two loops, unlike the
short distance correlation [13]. the worldsheet area elements in (14) are
known for a general metric [21]. but for integrating (14) we need to know
the propagator and the couplings in the ads black hole background.

the coupling of k and sk in the case of a worldsheet in ads5 was found
in [7]. the dilaton coupling follows simply from the relation between the
einstein and string frame metrics, gs = gee/2. therefore the one dilaton
coupling is 1/2, and should be the same in the present case. the sk coupling
was found to be f s,k = 2kz2/z2
max in ads5, but the coupling in a general
metric is unknown to us. the couplings of supergravity modes in ads5 were
also investigated in [16].

the eect of the horizon at z = zt comes in through the propagator, and
the fact that the wave function of the exchanged supergravity modes should
obey certain boundary conditions on the horizon, which makes the momen-
tum in the z direction discrete, as was shown in [18]. at large distances, a
particle exchanged between the two worldsheets will propagate parallel to the
horizon. therefore we assume that the full propagator will for large distances

6

(l  zt ) be of the form

g(z1, z2, l) = f (z1, z2)g3(l)

(15)

where g3(l) is the at three dimensional propagator, and all the z depen-
dence is in the unknown function f (z1, z2), where z1 and z2 are points on the
worldsheets. this agrees with wittens observation [18] that the exchange of
supergravity modes in the ve dimensional bulk corresponds to the exchange
of eld theory modes on the three dimensional boundary. the three dimen-
sional mass is given by m 2
i are the discrete eigenvalues
of the wave operator in the z direction.

t , where p2

in the high temperature limit the eld theory scalars and fermions acquire
masses. the dilaton which couples to trf 2 corresponds in eld theory to the
glueball states 0++. their masses were numerically calculated in [29, 30].
the eld s2 couples to the symmetric traceless tensor cij trx ix j, and corre-
sponds to a scalarball. when no external quarks, which are sources of both
0 and s2, are present we can restrict ourselves correlation functions of the
massless gauge elds, and only the glueball spectrum contributes. however,
when introducing an external heavy quark we should consider the exchange
of s2 as well, since the worldsheet acts as its source. this is quite clear from
the fact that the wilson loop ope [7] has both trf 2 and cij trx ix j terms.
this spoils the identication of the t   limit with pure qcd3. states
like s2, which have no counterparts in qcd, should be projected out by hand
if one wishes to make such an identication. note that even with no heavy
quarks present the glueball masses [29] are of the same order as the scalar
and fermion masses, and hence composites of the latter do not decouple.

although the eld s2 has m2 = 4 it can be shown numerically that
all eigenvalues are negative, meaning that the three dimensional modes have
positive m 2. the lowest mode is lighter than the lightest glueball. this is
not surprising since it originated from a ve dimensional mode with m2 lower
than the dilatons. for example, the lowest eigenvalue found in [29] for the
dilaton wave function was p2 = 11.59. for the s2 the lowest eigenvalue is
p2 = 2.3. we denote by ms and m the lightest three dimensional masses
of s2 and 0.
circular loops. the correlation of two circular wilson loops has two

phases. (i) for a small separation distance there is a connected solution.

(ii) for large distances the correlation is dominated by the exchange of
s2, as was the case in ads5 [7], but now using the 3 dimensional propagator

innite strip loops in x-y plane. we can also calculate the correlation of
two innite strip loops in the x-y plane. we now have a worldsheet that is
extended in one direction. therefore the supergravity modes can be emitted
and absorbed at any point along the y direction. this means that we should

write ql2 + (y1  y2)2 instead of l. according to (14) we should integrate

over y1, y2.

innite strip loops in x-t plane. the long distance correlation of two in-

case. although the worldsheet is extended in the t direction, it is not a dy-
namical direction in the t   limit. in calculating the three dimensional
spectrum we assumed zero momentum in the compact t direction.
the interest in the innite strip wilson loops comes from the fact that
we can relate the expectation value of the correlation of two such loops to
the potential between two heavy quark mesons. the potential in the n = 4
sym case was calculated in [7], and was found to be of the form expected
from qcd calculation [31].

the innite strip loop in the x-t plane corresponds to a meson in the n = 4
theory at nite temperature. the strip loop in the x-y plane corresponds
in the t   limit to a meson in a qcd3-like theory. in order to make
the identication with qcd3 we must project out states like s2 that have no
counterparts in qcd3.

these are the expected potentials in theories with a mass gap, and the spec-
ied dimensionality.

the generalization to other backgrounds [36] is more subtle. the back-
ground of other dp-branes is not of the form ws 5. therefore the exchanged
particles have kaluza-klein masses that vary with their position (since the
radius of the sphere is a function of z). one should also make an analysis of
the spectrum of type iib supergravity on the desired background.

4 baryon correlators

the correlation of baryons can be calculated using the same methods. the
baryonic conguration [33] in the ads5  s 5 background is composed of a
baryonic vertex made out of a d5 brane that wraps the s 5 and a set of n
strings stretching between the vertex and the boundary of ads5. in [34] a

9

l

simplied picture of this system was introduced where the action is just the
sum of the action of the wrapped d5 and the n strings. it was shown there
that the baryonic vertex will be situated at a certain z0 6= 0 and the total
action was found to be proportional to n times the action of a corresponding
wilson loop, namely  ngsn
where l is the radius of the baryon. improved
calculations based on the bps nature of the conguration were performed
in [37]. for the baryonic conguration in the conning non supersymmetric
background these bps methods are not applicable. a simplied analysis of
the three dimensional baryons derived from the large t limit of the ads5
black hole background resulted in energy of the form  n(r2t 2)l [34].
two such baryonic congurations can exchange supergravity modes that
can be emitted and absorbed by the worldsheet of the strings, and the
wrapped d5-brane. it is easy to realize that the l dependence of such an
exchange is the same as in the wilson loop correlations. however, the n
dependence will now be dierent since each of the baryon worldsheets is n
times that of a corresponding wilson loop. the meson-baryon potential will
be of order n1, and the baryon-baryon potential of order 1. again, this is
the expected behavior from theories with no dynamical quarks [35].

5 discussion

the purpose of this project was to compute certain properties of conning
large n gauge theories in the framework of the dual supergravity picture.
these properties include the expectation value of circular wilson loops and
the two point function of such loops and of innite strip loops.

whereas the renormalized circular wilson loop in the ads5  s 5 back-
ground was shown to be independent of the area of the loop [7, 6, 8], the
corresponding expectation value in the conning background admits an area
law behavior similar to the result for the innite strip in that background
[23]. in [21] sucient conditions for connement where written down for a
class of generalized metrics. in the present work we show that indeed loops
that obey these conditions yield an area law behavior for the circular wilson
loop. it will be interesting to further generalize this result to smooth loops
of arbitrary shape and to loops that include cusps [8].

a string dual to pure three dimensional ym theory was proposed in [18].
the idea is to put the ads5  s 5 background at nite temperature, impose

10

anti-periodic boundary conditions and take the innite temperature limit.
the corresponding gauge picture is that of the n = 4 sym in the innite
temperature limit. naively, it seems that the latter model corresponds to
the pure ym theory in three dimensions because the gauge elds remain
massless but the gauginos and the adjoint scalars acquire mass proportional
to the temperature.

our present work provides further evidence that in fact this is not the
case. the gravity background corresponds to a conning theory but not that
of the three dimensional pure ym theory. this follows from the calculation
of the meson-meson interaction that is dominated by an exchange of the
s2 mode rather than the dilaton. the s2 mode, which corresponds in the
nite temperature n = 4 description to a bound state of two scalars, and is
obviously absent from the pure ym spectrum, is lighter than the dilaton that
corresponds to the glueball 0++. it will be interesting to work out the exact
couplings of modes like s2 to the string worldsheet in a general background.
this will enable an explicit calculation of the correlator dependence on the
size and shape of the loop. we argue that a similar structure of exchange
interaction dominates the potential between two baryons.
