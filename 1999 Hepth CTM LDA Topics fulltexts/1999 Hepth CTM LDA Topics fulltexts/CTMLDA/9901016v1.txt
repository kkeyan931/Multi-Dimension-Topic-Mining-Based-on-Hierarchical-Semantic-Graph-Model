abstract: index theorems for the dirac operator allow one to study spinors on manifolds with
boundary and torsion. we analyse the modications of the boundary chernsimons correction
and aps  invariant in the presence of torsion. the bulk contribution must also be modied and
is computed using a supersymmetric quantum mechanics representation. here we nd agreement
with existing results which employed heat kernel and paulivillars techniques. nonetheless, this
computation also provides a stringent check of the feynman rules of de boer et al. for the
computation of quantum mechanical path integrals. our results can be veried via a duality
relation between manifolds admitting a killingyano tensor and manifolds with torsion. as
an explicit example, we compute the indices of taubnut and its dual constructed using this
method and nd agreement for any nite radius to the boundary. we also suggest a resolution
to the problematic appearance of the nieh-yan invariant multiplied by the regulator (mass)2 in
computations of the chiral gravitational anomaly coupled to torsion.

1. introduction

index theorems for manifolds with boundary and torsion involve a detailed understanding of
spinors on such manifolds. in the torsion free case this problem was understood long ago in the
mathematics literature and is solved by the atiyahpatodisinger index theorem [1]. essentially,
they found that the index for manifolds with boundary is the sum of the usual bulk result for
the index (proportional to the integral over the rst pontrjagin class) plus a correction from
the so-called  invariant of the boundary dirac operator. upon the addition of torsion, further
questions arise such as how does torsion aect the computation of the index in the bulk? what
are the appropriate boundary conditions for spinors on such manifolds and how does one dene
the adjoint of operators acting on these spinors? how does torsion modify the computation of

1

the  invariant? are there corrections to the index over and above that found by gilkey [2] if
the metric is not of product form near the boundary? from a physical viewpoint the resolution
of these questions is of considerable interest, not only because of the relation between the index
of the dirac operator and anomalies, but also due to the considerable importance attached to
the physics of supergravity theories (involving, of course, both spinors and torsion) on manifolds
with boundary, e.g. anti de sitter spaces [3].

manifolds in the einsteincartan theory which include torsion are not nearly as well studied
as those without, and solutions of the equations of motion tend to be of considerable complexity,
making explicit checks of the general formalism we are about to present cumbersome. fortu-

nately, we can relate the index of a manifold m with torsion to a torsion free manifold fm when
their dirac operators, d/ (e, a) and d/ (e,ev ) respectively, satisfy 1

(1.1)

{ d/ (e, a), d/ (e,ev ) } = 0

(note that d/ (e,ev ) denotes the dirac operator with inverse vierbein er
an abelian vector eld ev , whose necessity will be explained later, and d/ (e, a) refers to inverse

 and coupling to totally antisymmetric torsion which may be re-expressed via hodge
vierbein er
duality as minimal coupling to an axial vector eld a). this equation will be made mathemati-
cally more precise later, it suces to say here that if we are able to nd a pair of manifolds whose
dirac operators are related in this way, we will be able to test our results for index theorems on
manifolds with boundary in a concrete example. in what follows we will refer to the manifold

symmetry generators d/ (e, a) = rer

and may be viewed as the inverse vierbein of the dual manifold m. we also stress that in the

with torsion m as the dual of the torsion-less manifold fm.
in fact, as was pointed out in [5], for the case where one takes the manifold fm as the
d/ (e,ev ) = reer
quantum case, when one considers the dirac operators d/ (e, a) and d/ (e,ev ) depending on dirac

matrices satisfying a cliord algebra, equation (1.1) is more subtle than in the classical case
where one has supersymmetry charges depending on world line majorana spinors obeying canon-
ical poisson brackets. the quantisation of killingyano symmetries is, in fact, an important
aspect of our work.

(1.4)

we should mention that the dual taubnut manifold possesses neither self-dual riemann curva-
ture tensors nor satises the einsteincartan equations but this is unimportant for our purposes
since it does satisfy the central equation (1.1).

our chief line of argument to compute the index of a manifold with torsion and boundary
follows the atiyahpatodisinger index theorem [1]. we split the computation into a contribution
from the bulk and a boundary contribution. the bulk contribution is computed by representing
the index as the regulated trace of 5

index d/ = tr(cid:20)5 exp(cid:16) 

2

d/ 2(cid:17)(cid:21)

(1.5)

which in turn may be represented as a supersymmetric quantum mechanical path integral [6].
in this approach, however, one essentially inserts innitely many sets of plane wave resolutions
of unity, for which one may clearly integrate by parts. therefore this calculation is insensitive
to the precise boundary conditions obeyed by the states appearing in the trace in (1.5) and
yields only the bulk contribution to the index. in fact, analogous computations have also been
carried out in a heat kernel [7] as well as pauli villars [8] framework and yield results identical to
ours. nonetheless, our independent computation is interesting in its own right since it provides
a stringent test of the rigorous quantum mechanical path integral formalism for sigma models
in curved space developed by de boer et al. [9, 10] (and in particular of the christ and lee 2
counter terms [11] that must be added to the action in order that the path integral provides
a faithful representation of the trace (1.5)). the details of this computation are described in
section 2.

having calculated the bulk contribution one must compute the boundary contribution which
has two parts. the rst is the  invariant for the boundary manifold. the  invariant is a
spectral invariant of the boundary dirac operator and may be computed from the eigenvalues of
this operator. in the torsion free case this problem was solved for various asymptotic geometries
by hitchin (and applied to the taubnut manifold in [12, 13, 14]). therefore, we generalise the
computation of hitchin to include the dual taubnut example. to this end we construct and
solve the boundary dirac operator in the presence of torsion which allows us to compute the 
invariant for this manifold.

3

the second boundary contribution, due to gilkey [2], is necessary in the case where the
manifold is not of product form at the boundary. the main idea is that the aps analysis is valid
for manifolds which approach a cylinder whose cross section is the boundary manifold. if this is
not the case, one must make an extra boundary correction proportional to the integral over the
boundary of the dierence between the chernsimons form computed using the product metric
and that computed using the metric itself. this computation can be easily generalised to the
torsion-full case where we nd a boundary correction proportional to a generalised chernsimons
term. note, in particular, that all our results hold for manifolds with boundaries at any nite
radius, rather than just in some non-compact limit. the derivations of the boundary corrections
are to be found in section 3.

section 4 analyses in detail the precise relation between index theorems of manifolds pos-
sessing mutually anticommuting dirac operators. this relation requires a careful understanding
of boundary conditions for spinors and therefore the space of states in the trace (1.5). sub-
section 4.2 outlines the main ingredients of the killingyano technique to generate manifolds
with mutually anticommuting dirac operators and the explicit geometric data for our example
manifolds, taubnut and dual taubnut may be found in 4.3. also included in subsection 4.2
is the generalisation of the killingyano construction to the quantum case.

urgent readers not wishing to wade through all the details may nd the nal expression for
the index with torsion on manifolds with boundary in equation (3.32). a summary of the results
we obtained for the example manifolds is presented in subsection 4.4. finally, more speculative
remarks along with possible applications of our results are reserved for the conclusion where,
in particular, we discuss the controversial 1/ regulator (mass)2 niehyan contribution to the
index in light of our work. in passing, we note that many of the issues we encounter have been
dealt with in some depth in the mathematics and physics literature so that we have attempted
to present these more formal aspects in an accessible format.

2. bulk contribution to the index with torsion

2.1 the dirac index as a quantum mechanical path integral

this section is devoted to the computation of the bulk computation to the index employing the
supersymmetric path integral approach of alvarez-gaume and witten [6]. the bulk contribution
to the index of the dirac operator with torsion has already been computed in [7] via a heat
kernel expansion and in [8] using paulivillars regularisation, needless to say, our results exactly
reproduce those of these authors. besides the high degree of certainty one now has in the result
(see equation (2.19)), our motivations for performing this calculation were fourfold:

1. our computation is carried out in the framework of rigorously dened quantum mechanical
curved space path integrals introduced by de boer et al. [9, 10] and therefore provides a
stringent check of their work. in particular, we note that the result depends crucially on

4

the christ and lee terms [11] (see the second line of (2.13)) that one must add to the action
appearing in the path integral at order 2 = 2 in order to employ propagators derived via
a midpoint rule.

2. there has been some controversy in the literature over the appearance of a term in the
(bulk) index with torsion that diverges as one takes the limit in which the regulator is
removed [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. this term is proportional to the niehyan tensor (see
the rst term on the right hand side of (2.19)) and arises at tree level in our path integral
expansion. in the path integral approach, one clearly sees the importance of including this
term in order to obtain the correct results for the bulk index (i.e. the regulator independent
contribution) since it appears as a vertex as well as in disconnected graphs.

3. the path integral derivation is based on inserting innitely many plane wave resolutions
of unity. therefore one clearly sees that it is only sensitive to the bulk contribution, since
dierentiations by parts then ignore any boundary terms.

4. the quantum mechanical model itself is of intrinsic interest since it describes a spinning
particle moving through a background with torsion. obviously, the construction of the
precise path integral quantisation of this model is an important step in understanding its
quantum dynamics.

the index of the dirac operator d/ is given by the trace over the spectrum

index d/ = tr(cid:20)5 exp(cid:16)

2

d/ 2(cid:17)(cid:21) .

(2.1)

when there is a gap between the zero-modes and the remainder of the spectrum [21] this result
should, of course, be -independent. however, for manifolds with boundary, one must carefully
take into account the states traced over. if one is interested in the bulk contribution only, the
trace can be evaluated by inserting n sets of plane waves (where dt  1/n  0) and the result
may then be represented as a path integral. the expression one then nds is an expansion in
powers of 

11(d/ ) + 0(d/ ) + o()  (d/ ) .

(2.2)

the one-loop beta independent contribution 0(d/ ) yields the bulk result for the index and as
will be explained in section 3, the complete result for the index is obtained by including the aps
and chernsimons boundary correction terms. here we will compute the terms 1(d/ ) and
0(d/ ). we comment on the interpretation of the 1/ contribution 1(d/ ) in the conclusion.
before introducing the details of our path integral computation, let us briey summarise the
main ingredients of the approach. to begin with, one treats the exponential in the trace (2.1)
as the imaginary time evolution operator of a quantum mechanical system. the operator in

5

the exponent corresponds to the hamiltonian. importantly, its operator ordering is now xed
so that the usual step where one begins with some classical hamiltonian generating dynamics
via poisson brackets and then elevates this expression to an operator, xing the ordering by
symmetry principles (or ultimately experiment!) is not needed. the operator h = 2d/ 2/2 is
the quantum hamiltonian.

the next step is to derive the path integral by inserting n complete sets of states. the
achievement of de boer et al. was to derive a path integral which faithfully represents the operator
expression (2.1). the point being that once one takes the continuum limit n  , the discretised
expressions derived at nite n become distributions whose products (which appear in feynman
diagrams) are ambiguous. however, given the rigorous discretised expression for the path integral
it is always possible to resolve these ambiguities in a unique and nite fashion. their derivation
was performed by rewriting the quantum hamiltonian in a weyl ordered form which allows
innitesimal transition elements at intermediate steps in the path to be evaluated by a midpoint
rule which leads to a certain set of vertices, propagators and rules for products of distributions.
of course another ordering principle would have yielded dierent propagators and vertices, the
key point is to derive a path integral which precisely represents2 (2.1).

we now turn to the details our calculation and begin by thinking of the exponential in (2.1)

exp[i( 2d/ 2/2)(i)/]

(2.3)

as a quantum mechanical evolution operator exp[iht/] with hamiltonian  2d/ 2/2, unit
euclidean time interval and plancks constant  = . the dirac matrices are then identied
with fermionic coordinates and the derivative operator  with the canonical momentum of the
bosonic coordinate x,

r = 2 1/2 r ,
{r, s} =  rs ,

 = 1g

4 ip g 1
4 ,

[x, p] = i 

 .

(2.4)

2it is interesting to compare this situation to what one nds in quantum eld theory.

in quantum eld
theory, one must regulate and renormalise to obtain a path integral yielding nite, well dened results for the
products of distributions appearing at loop level in feynman diagrams. furthermore, one makes some choice of
renormalisation point in order to make contact with physical quantities. of course, in quantum mechanics, there
is no anomaly in scale invariance and the path integral z[y, r] (see (2.6)) should provide an unambiguous and
nite representation of the transition amplitude hy, |  5 exp 
2 d/ 2 |y, i. although, the quantum mechanical
hamiltonian h = 2d/ 2/2 has a denite operator ordering, in passing to a path integral representation, the
ertices of the path integral are ambiguous up to reorderings of the hamiltonian. however, once a particular
ordering (there is nothing sacrosanct about weyl ordering, it is merely convenient) is xed one must decide
(derive) which rule is used to dene products of distributions.
in analogy with quantum eld theory theory,
the discretisation procedure and rule for the products of delta and heaviside functions above may be thought of
as regulating and renormalising the theory with renormalisation point judiciously chosen to reproduce the the
required transition amplitude with the given hamiltonian.

6

the similarity transformation for the canonical momentum p (with g = det g) implies the
inner product hx|yi = g1/24(x  y). observe also that the rescalings by appropriate factors of
 in (2.4) ensure that  plays the role of plancks constant in the canonical commutation relations
and that the hamiltonian  2d/ 2/2 begins with a classical  independent contribution, plus
possibly terms linear and quadratic in  (depending on the precise ordering in which one writes
the operators x, p and r).

we may now represent the index (2.1) by a path integral with periodic boundary conditions,

the presence of 5 in the trace yields periodic boundary conditions for the fermions also.

(2.6)

as discussed above, one usually expects path integrals to be plagued with ambiguities associated
with the normalisation and precise denition of the measure along with products of distributions
in loops. fortunately however, nite interval path integrals in curved space have been studied in
detail by de boer et al. [9, 10]. in particular they have found the precise denition of z above,
i.e. the exact vertices and feynman rules, such that the path integral representation (2.5) is
identically equal to the index (d/ ). a two loop verication of their work in the torsion-less case
may be found in [22] along with the conventions employed in this paper. we now spell out the
key details of this approach.

firstly, although manifestly the quantum mechanical trace (2.1) is nite, in the path integral,
closed bose loops h q(t) q(t)i yield delta function divergences (0) (rst observed by lee and
g1/2 at each point of the path which one may exponentiate via bosonic and fermionic ghosts a(t)
and {b(t), c(t)}, respectively [24, 25] yielding the ghost action

yang [23]). however, the decomposition of unity 1 = r d4x g1/2|xi hx| yields a measure factor

whose net eect is to precisely cancel the divergence (0) whenever it appears (for example graphs
including a ghost loop are needed to cancel the divergence in the third graph of table 4).

secondly, ambiguous products of distributions involving heaviside and delta functions (t 
s)(t  s) also appear. the result of [9, 10] is that adopting vertices corresponding to a weyl
ordered hamiltonian, one nds propagators such that (t  s)(t  s) = (0) = 1/2 (strictly

7

speaking, one returns to the discretised derivation of the path integral where the delta function
is a kronecker delta ij and the propagators depend on the discrete heaviside function with
ii = 1/2). more precisely, one must rewrite the operator valued hamiltonian h = 2d/ 2/2 in
weyl ordered form. thereafter one obtains the lagrangian3

l = ip x +

1
2

r r + h .

(2.8)

by replacing operators by c-numbers in the weyl ordered hamiltonian. in general one then nds
additional vertices, over and above the classical result, of order  and 2. the exact propagators
are then those given in [9, 10] and in our conventions in [22]. note that employing the vertices
of (2.13) and propagators of table 1 along with the above rule for products of distributions even
the overall normalisation of the path integral as given in (2.5) is exactly correct.

our task then is to rewrite the operator h = 2d/ 2/2 in weyl ordered form, i.e. in terms
of symmetrised products of the bose operators x and p and antisymmetrised products for the
fermions r. in particular, for the fermions, this just means that all products of dirac matrices
should be written in the basis r, rs, rst and rstu. this computation will involve three dierent
spin connections so to avoid confusion let us spell out our notations. the dirac operator is

d/ = d/ (e, a) = d() ,

 = er

r , d() =  + 1

4rsrs .

(2.9)

here d() denotes an operator depending on the spin connection rs = (e)rs + ars where
(e)rs is the torsion free connection and ars is a completely antisymmetric contortion ten-
sor. the classical ( independent) contribution to h has been computed in [26] and yields the

(e)rs + 3ars with contortion three times the usual one. hence we introduce the operator

hamiltonian for a spinning particle depending on a third connection brs = rs + 2ars =
d(b) identical to the previous denition except depending on the new connection brs. we

(2.13)

at this point the vertices of the theory are those dened by (2.13) and propagators along with
products of distributions are those found according to the midpoint rule. observe that the term
at order  vanishes identically. for zero torsion, the above result has appeared in [27]. note
also that the rst two o(2) terms in the second line of (2.13) are neither general coordinate
(gc) nor local lorentz (ll) invariant. from rst principles however, we know that the result
r and rs with
for the index must enjoy these invariances, since varying the background elds e
respect to gc and ll transformations, the operator d/ 2 varies into a commutator [d/ 2, g + l],
(g and l are the generators of gc and ll transformations) which vanishes under the trace
as [5, g + l] = 0 = [5, d/ 2]. the resolution of this apparent dichotomy is simply that the
propagators, based on the midpoint rule obtained by weyl ordering, are also not gc or ll
covariant. nonetheless, as we shall see, the combination of these two evils will yield a gc and
ll invariant result.

2.2 loop expansion of the path integral

we are now ready to compute the path integral via a loopwise expansion in the planck constant 
to orders 1 and 0 employing the feynman rules for the nite-time path integral of [9, 10]. the
split into free and interacting parts is made via the expansion around backgrounds y and  so

that x  y + q and r  r + r. the spin connectionb is now an independent background

eld hence in our diagrammatic computation we make a riemann normal coordinate expansion
for the metric only (details can be found in the references just mentioned as well as in [22]). we
have listed the propagators in table 1 and some of the required integrals in table 2. other useful
diagrammatic tricks and identities for this type of computation have been developed in [22].

we only need compute graphs quartic in background fermions r (in the diagrams they
are denoted by a dash on the external line) in order to saturate the grassmann integration d4
in (2.5) which in turn yields a four-dimensional levi-civita symbol. there are several tree level

(2.14)

beginning with the leading 1/ contribution to which we draw the readers attention. this
contribution is proportional to the so-called niehyan tensor [28, 29]. as expressed above it is
clear that this tensor vanishes for exact torsion; alternatively one can re-express the nieh-yan
contribution into a perhaps more familiar form by writing

2 [a] = r()[]  2 a[a

] .

(2.15)

where r() is the riemann curvature of the torsion-full connection rs = (e)rs + ars.
we will discuss this contribution, which has led to some confusion in the literature, in more
detail in the conclusion. observe that the order 0 terms are also proportional to the curl of
the torsion, though not immediately recognisable as a topological invariant as they are only a
part of the result at this order in the planck constant. furthermore, observe that the product
of the niehyan tree level tree level 1 contribution and the christ and lee weyl ordering
counter-terms yield the second and third o(0) terms in (2.14). this provides the long sought
after explicit conrmation that these two loop counter terms (they appear with a factor 2 in
the action (2.13)) are actually necessary in a rigorous denition of the path integral.

the remaining graphs involve one- and two-loop integrals and are given in tables 3 and 4.
note that we have not drawn graphs obtained by dierent locations of the dots, which denote
time derivatives on propagators, although these contributions are, of course, included in the
quoted results. adding all these contributions together our result for the regulated trace of 5 is

compute the partition function z[y, r], the generating function of all diagrams, disconnected products of two
loop and tree graphs will produce  independent results which must not be neglected.

10

observe that the scalar curvature on the second line of (2.16) is that of the torsion-free riemann
curvature since it comes from the gure eight graph on the last line of table 4 in which one
expands the metric g(y + q) to second order in quantum uctuations q(t) which in riemann
normal coordinates yields the torsion free riemann curvature.

a useful test of the result (2.16) is independence of the choice of complexication of the
original majorana spinors required to employ a coherent state formalism for the fermions. the
three terms from the one-loop diagrams and the single term from the two-loop diagram do indeed
vanish upon using the schouten identity, by virtue of the fact that k mn is anti-symmetric.

to facilitate comparison with existing results and see that the result is a total derivative it is
 where
v = [d, d]v. furthermore, we rewrite the result in terms of the axial contortion vector

useful to extract the dependence on the torsion free curvature which we denote by r

(2.17)

the cross terms between r and the torsion vanish identically by virtue of the ricci symmetry
r[] = 0 and so do the terms quartic in the torsion. the second line of (2.16) is easily written
as a covariant derivative by commuting the triple derivatives using

ddda = ddda + dar + 1

(2.18)

this brings (2.16) into a form derived previously using heat kernel methods by obukhov [7],

exact, the above expression (2.16) reduces to the term quadratic in r(b) which coincides with

as long as the k vector is smooth (as it is for smooth metric and torsion), the additional
contribution dk to the bulk index in the presence of torsion will only receive contributions
from the boundary. the subtle interplay between the three order 0 terms in (2.19) can be
clearly seen in the explicit example given in subsection 4.4.1 below.

complexication of the majorana spinors, as explained in [10].

we stress that the nieh-yan term in the action (2.13) along with the christ and lee two-
loop weyl ordering counter-terms have been crucial in obtaining this result (see the two-loop
diagrams in table 4 as well as (2.14)). although the 1/ niehyan bulk contribution to index
has appeared in the literature before [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], in our path integral approach one
sees clearly its importance for the order 0 terms and hence the necessity to include it when
computing the bulk index in the presence of torsion. we will comment further on this term in
the conclusion.

finally, we observe that the folkloric statement; the chiral anomaly is topological and
therefore insensitive to the subtleties of the precise denition of the path integral can be made
very denitive in the approach employed above. the reason being that in the absence of torsion
the dierent counter terms corresponding to varying ordering schemes have no aect on the
0 result since they are all higher loop eects. only once the torsion is turned on, so that
the lagrangian includes the 1/ niehyan contribution must one worry about the subtleties of
ordering schemes etc. when computing the  independent anomaly.

3. boundary contributions to the index with torsion

3.1 the aps boundary correction with torsion

on manifolds with boundary, the central question is which boundary conditions one must impose
for spinors in order that the index problem is well posed. exactly this problem was solved by
atiyah, patodi and singer in the mid-seventies [1] for manifolds which have a product form near
the boundary (i.e. when the manifold is a cylinder with the boundary manifold as cross section).
in this case the hilbert space is suciently under control and consistent boundary conditions
can be imposed on spinors. moreover, due to the fact that the radial factor can be written down
explicitly, the index computation can be reduced the problem of suitably counting the dierence
between the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of the boundary dirac operator.

for manifolds that are not of a product form, a split of the hilbert space is not as obvious.
nevertheless, due to the topological nature of the index, it is possible to deform these manifolds
until their boundary takes a product form. the index then splits into a bulk part plus the

also ensure that any surface terms also vanish by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on
spinors. however, local neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions do not lead to solutions of
the rst order homogeneous zero-mode dirac equation. instead non-local boundary conditions
are required.

let us write the dirac operator (3.1) in a chiral basis for the dirac matrices

[r](cid:1) + b

(cid:19)

(3.2)

where v is some function of the normal variable r. the 2  2 matrix b is hermitean acting on
spinors on the compact boundary manifold m. the aps split of the index computation into
a bulk piece and a boundary piece can only be achieved if (3.2) takes a simpler form near the
boundary. first of all, b has to be independent of r and the connection trace (e)
[r] should

15

vanish. this holds when the manifold is a product metric near the boundary. in addition we will
require that there is no radial component of the torsion (i.e. a[r] = 0) as this would enter
the dirac operator in a way similar to the connection trace and prohibit an explicit solution of
the radial part of the eigenfunction. although the aps condition can be imposed by smoothly
deforming the manifold near the boundary, it is not obvious that such a deformation argument
can be used to set a radial torsion component to zero.

when these conditions are satised, atiyah et al. found that one can consistently impose the

following non-local boundary conditions on spinors ,

xl0
xl<0

|l ih l| (rb) = 0

|l ih l| (rb) = 0



 =  
! ,

b |l i = l |l i .

where the boundary is at r = rb and the two component spinors |l i are eigenspinors of b,

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

only for such non-local boundary conditions does a non-trivial set of zero-modes of the dirac
operator survive. the index splits in a bulk and a boundary piece as indicated according to

indexd/ = index(bulk) 

1

2(cid:16)b(0) + hb(cid:17)

where index(bulk) is the usual integral over the second pontrjagin class, h is the number of
harmonic spinors on the boundary manifold m, i.e. the number of solutions to b  = 0, and
b(s) is a spectral invariant of the boundary operator b given by

b(s) =xl6=0

sign(l)
|l|s

(3.6)

where the sum runs over the eigenvalues l of the boundary dirac operator b. as a function of
the complex variable s, b(s) has a well dened analytic continuation to s = 0 [1, 30, 31].

when b only has a nite number of eigenvalues one can take s = 0 before summing (3.6) (for
other cases in which the aps conditions can be made explicit see e.g. [32, 33]). in this case, one
can understand the appearance of b(0) in the expression for the index rather easily. assuming
that near the boundary at r = rb the manifold is a product metric, the zero mode equation on
this cylinder can be written as

 + b

  0
  b 0 ! ck ekr|li

dk ekr|li! = (k + l) dk ekr|li

(k  l) ck ekr|li! = 0

(3.7)

16

(for the product metric we may simultaneously diagonalise b and ). this implies that positive
chirality zero-modes (those for which only the upper components are non-vanishing) have k = l
while those of negative chirality have k = l. the boundary conditions (3.3) imply that the
positive chirality states have only negative eigenvalues of b while the negative chirality states
carry positive b-eigenvalues (due to the relation between k and l this implies that only zero-
modes which vanish exponentially as r   remain). the contribution to the index from the
cylinder is therefore the disparity between the number of negative and positive eigenvalues of b
which is clearly given by (3.6) at s = 0 and this limit may be taken before performing the nite
summation (the factor 1/2 in (3.5) arises from the fact that half of the spinor boundary modes
do not continue smoothly into the interior [1, 32]). the aps theorem renders this argument
rigorous for operators b with an innite number of eigenvalues and also shows that the index
problem indeed splits in a bulk and boundary piece according to (3.5) by appropriately gluing
the two pieces of the manifold.

before we discuss the gilkey correction term, we will now rst show how the  invariant can
be computed for a class of boundary dirac operators general enough to include the torsion-full
examples to be discussed later.

3.2 computation of the  invariant for manifolds with torsion and s3 boundary

the  invariant must be computed on a case by case basis and since it involves all non-zero
boundary eigenvalues this can be rather tricky. fortunately this computation has been carried
out by hitchin for a large class of boundary geometries [34] (to be specic, squashed s3 metrics).
the addition of torsion modies the boundary dirac operator by what amounts to only a slight
generalisation of hitchins calculations. however, in keeping with the rest of this paper and
because the explicit solutions we nd to the boundary dirac equation will be needed when we
explain how one is able to compare index problems for manifolds with mutually anticommuting
dirac operators in section 4, we will now present these additional details.

we begin with a boundary operator of the form

b = s(cid:0)341 + 422(cid:1) +

1


143  1234(cid:20)2 + 2

4

+ z(cid:21) .

(3.8)

where , s and z are arbitrary parameters (depending, in general, on rb). the operators i
commute with the so(3) killing vectors (i.e. they are the inverses of the left-invariant forms)
and satisfy the algebra

[1, 2] = 3

and cyclic.

(3.9)

to motivate the somewhat obscure looking form we have chosen for the operator (3.8), we note
that it exactly the case solved by hitchin [34] when s = z = 0. the generalised form presented
here can be handled too and (as we will see) appears in the example manifolds discussed in

4

+ z .

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

therefore it is most useful to solve the eigenvalue problem p (s, z)  = z. to begin with call
i = iji where ji is the angular momentum operator (i = 1, .., 3) (and we employ the usual
eigenstates |j, mi of j 2 and j3). note that the hitchin operator commutes with the casimir
[j 2, p (s, z)] = 0 so we may look for solutions at a xed j. actually, it is easy to solve this
equation with the following ansatz

|j, m + 1i(cid:19)
 =(cid:18) |j, mi

(3.13)

where we dene |j, j + 1i = 0 = |j,j  1i. then if m = j or m = j  1 we clearly obtain
solutions with eigenvalue

z = j/ + (2 + 2)/4 + z.

(3.14)

now if j > m > j  1 so that  p(j  m)(j + m + 1) is real and non-vanishing then we

have solutions with eigenvalues

z =  s  (m + 1)/ + (2 + 2)/4 + z

where  solves the equation

to conform with the notation of hitchin we relabel j = (p + q  1)/2 and m = (p  q  1)/2 so

where the integers p and q take all values strictly greater than zero (note that the multiplicities
above refer to distinct eigenvalues). to understand the multiplicities quoted in (3.18), it is useful
to briey explain the representation theory of states on s3. the metric on the squashed s3
(considered in this section) may be represented (up to an overall irrelevant scaling) in terms of
left invariant forms i (i = 1, .., 3) as

ds2(cid:12)(cid:12)s3 = (1)2 + (2)2 + (3/(s))2

(3.19)

from the invariant forms one may write down left invariant vectors i which commute with
the killing vectors ki and satisfy the algebra (the explicit forms of these vectors are given in
section 4.3)

[1, 2] = 3
[i , kj] = 0 ,
[k1 , k2] = k3

and cyclic,

and cyclic.

(3.20)

representing the operators i on the space {|j, mi} as above and the killing vectors on a second
copy of this space {|j, mi} then from the relation

(i)2 =

3xi=1

(ki)2

3xi=1

(3.21)

expressing equality of the casimirs on s3 (which may be easily veried from the explicit forms
in 4.3), one nds the representation space of functions on s3 to be {|j, mi|j, mi} which yields
the multiplicities quoted above (since in (3.18) we suppressed the dependence on the right
representation |j, mi).

we are now left with the task of computing b(0) = p (0) as in (3.6) given the spec-
trum (3.18). therefore we must nd the analytic continuation to s = 0 of (we drop an overall

sum over positive and negative eigenvalues, but in general one should of course worry about
this separation as well as any zero-modes of the boundary operator). the single sum can be
expressed in zeta functions without any diculty. the double sum requires a lengthy analysis,
most easily performed by rst taylor expanding in powers of the new variable  dened by

result (3.26).

3.3 boundary correction for non-product metrics

the aps analysis presented in the previous two subsections is valid for the manifolds whose
metric takes a product form [1] at the boundary (more intuitively, those manifolds which, near
the boundary, are a cylinder with the boundary manifold as cross section). if this is not the case,
the manifold has to be deformed to such a product structure near the boundary before the above
machinery can be applied. the bulk term should in turn also be computed for this deformed
metric. as an explicit form of the deformed metric is often not available, it is, however, much
easier to determine instead the error that one has made by computing the bulk contribution
using the original metric. this error term, due to gilkey [2] for torsion-less manifolds, has to be
subtracted from the bulk.

the form of this correction is rather simple. in the absence of torsion, the bulk term can be

written as a boundary integral

1

24.82 zm

r  r =

1

24.82 zm

1

24.82 zm

dc =

c ,

(3.27)

provided discontinuities of c are taken into account properly. for the metric deformed to a
product structure near the boundary, we get a boundary integral with c replaced by the chern
simons term of the product metric g
 = g(r = rb), c . therefore, in the absence of torsion,
the correction term that has to be added is

1

24.82zm

[c   c] ,

(3.28)

where the chernsimons three-form c =   r  1
3      (and similarly for c  built from
sharped objects computed from the product metric). note that the integrand of (3.28) can
be written as   r where  =    is the second fundamental form and  and  are the
torsion-free spin connections computed from the metric and product metrics respectively. (where
we warn the reader that from here on we replace (e) by simply  to denote the torsion-free
spin connection.) however, for intuitive, along with practical reasons, we prefer the form given
in (3.28).

for the torsionfull case the integrand of the bulk index derived in section 2 above may be

written as the exterior derivative of a generalised chernsimons form

  r

2

a  f  2 k  c(a)  2 k

where the three-form k is the hodge dual of the vector k in (2.20),

k =

k .

therefore, the boundary correction for the torsion-full case is simply

[c (a)  2 k  c(a) + 2 k] ,

21

(3.29)

(3.30)

(3.31)

where k is computed by inserting r = rb in the axial contortion vector a before computing
the covariant derivatives in (2.20).

3.4 generalised aps index theorem

orchestrating the above bulk results presented in (2.19) as well as the  term and the boundary
contribution (3.31) we obtain an aps index theorem generalised to manifolds with torsion

4. index theorems for manifolds with mutually anticommuting dirac

operators

4.1 general formulation

the existence of mutually anticommuting dirac operators on a pair of manifolds can be employed
to derive a relation between the index theorems on these manifolds which we shall now present in
detail. at the end of this section we test this relation on the explicit example of the taubnut
and dual taubnut manifolds.

to begin with, given a manifold m with (possibly torsion-full) dirac operator d/ (e, a)

satisfying

d/ (e, a) = d/ (e, a) ,

{d/ (e, a), 5} = 0 ,

(4.1)

then let us assume that we have found a second operator d/ (e,ev ) acting on spinors dened on

m which solves the equations

{d/ (e, a), d/ (e,ev )} = 0

d/ (e,ev ) = d/ (e,ev ) ,

{d/ (e,ev ), 5} = 0 .

(4.2)

(4.3)

at this point we do not yet identify d/ (e,ev ) with the dirac operator on a manifold fm. im-

portantly the hermiticity requirement in (4.3) is formulated on the manifold m (the precise

22

denition of the adjoint operation for spinors on manifolds with boundary was presented in sec-
, observe that it will certainly be
tion 3.1). in general, given that the inverse vierbeine er

necessary to include the additional vector coupling ev  in d/ (e,ev ) to satisfy both (4.2) and (4.3).
as the operators id/ (e,ev ) and id/ (e, a) anticommute, we can construct a new operator

5d/ (e, a) commuting with the original dirac operator,

 6= er

[id/ (e,ev ), 5d/ (e, a)] = 0 .

these two operators (hermitean on m) can thus be diagonalised simultaneously. eigenspinors
with non-zero eigenvalues occur in pairs for both operators, since they anticommute with 5.

however, eigenspinors with vanishing id/ (e,ev ) eigenvalues are not necessarily those with zero

5d/ (e, a) eigenvalues. nonetheless, in the computation of the index,

index d/ (e,ev ) = n+(d/ (e,ev ))  n(d/ (e,ev )) ,

they still occur in pairs (n+ denotes the number of zero-modes with positive chirality). the
above expression therefore only receives contributions from those zero-modes that are also zero-

of zero-modes which do not have a partner of opposite chirality. the same holds true when we

modes of 5d/ (e, a), that is ker  (id/ (e,ev ))  ker  (5d/ (e, a)), where ker  denotes the set
interchange the role of the two dirac operators and we therefore also have ker  (id/ (e,ev )) 
ker  (5d/ (e, a)). we may therefore conclude that the indices of id/ (e,ev ) and 5d/ (e, a) are

equal and hence5

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

index d/ (e,ev ) = index d/ (e, a) ,

since if  is an eigenspinor of the operator 5 d/ (e, a) then 5 is the corresponding eigenspinor
of id/ (e, a).

the equation (4.6) becomes much more interesting if one is able to view the operator d/ (e,ev )
as the dirac operator on the manifold fm but one must then carefully consider the space on which
the operators d/ (e, a) and d/ (e,ev ) act. the reason being that typically one is interesting in

computing the index of the dirac operator as a trace over states

space of spinors on m should coincide with that on fm. furthermore, although the operator
d/ (e,ev ) was assumed to be antihermitean on the manifold m, since the volume elements of the
two manifolds will in general not be equal, the operator d/ (e,ev ) will have no denite hermiticity
viewed as an operator on spinors on fm. therefore we make the additional assumption, (which

holds for the example we have in mind)

assumption: the space of spinors (which were dened in detail in subsection 3.1 in such a way
that index problems are well-posed) viewed as a four-component space of functions on m and

clearly however, by the assumption, if the above similarity transformation is non-singular then

fm coincide.
notice that as a consequence the index problem for the operator d/ (e,ev ) is well posed on the
manifold fm. this can be seen as follows. even though the operator d/ (e,ev ) has no denite
hermiticity on the manifold fm the operator ed/ (e,ev ) pg(e)/g(e) d/ (e,ev )pg(e)/g(e) is anti-
hermitean on fm. furthermore if  are a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions of d/ (e,ev )
on m thenpg(e)/g(e) are a complete set of orthonormal eigenfunctions of ed/ (e,ev ) on fm.
the set of functions  are still complete (although no longer orthonormal) on fm so that d/ (e,ev )
can still be diagonalised on fm leading to a well posed index problem on that manifold.
problems calculated on m and fm,
index d/ (e, a)  trm 5 exp(cid:0)
manifolds m and fm one only needs to require equality of the projection operators

which is the main result of this section. if we recall the discussion of boundary conditions for
spinors on manifolds with boundary in section 3.1, we see that to verify our assumption for the

d/ (e,ev )2(cid:1)  index d/ (e,ev ) (4.8)

it should now be clear that given the above assumption we have equality of well posed index

where (e)rs is the torsion free part of the spin connection computed from the inverse vierbein

. the trick now is that the hermitean term ev is nothing but the coupling of the dirac

operator to a purely imaginary abelian gauge eld whose contribution to the index we may obtain
by a naive analytic continuation from the well know results for the index of the dirac operator
with such couplings6.

in the remainder of this section we show that manifolds with mutually anticommuting dirac
operators can be found if invertible killingyano tensor exist and the above relation is realised
explicitly by taubnut and its dual manifold. also provided are all relevant geometric data for
these manifolds.

4.2 killingyano dual manifolds

manifolds with torsion admitting two dirac operators that satisfy the properties discussed
in the previous section do in fact exist and are understood in a systematic way [5] (at least
in the case where the dirac operator is viewed as a classical supercharge). before we move on
to an explicit index computation we describe the killingyano technique for generating these
manifolds.

the operator d/ (e,ev ) can be viewed as the quantum analogue of the supercharge of a

spinning particle and in this context the additional dirac operator d/ (e, a) generates the extended
r
supersymmetry. up to ordering ambiguities this means that the conditions on the tensors e
and arst appearing in the additional dirac operator such that it anticommutes with the original
dirac operator can be deduced from the existence conditions of extended supersymmetry of the
classical model [36] (see [5] for the extension to include torsion). in short, additional supercharges

on the manifold fm are given by

d/ (e, a) = rer

where the tensor er

(4.15)

6in the example below we will anyway nd a vanishing contribution from this additional abelian vector coupling,
however in general it is quite simple to handle. the bulk term is just the usual result for the abelian anomaly
modulo an overall minus sign due to the analytic continuation. the chernsimons and aps boundary corrections
are computed exactly as described in section 3.

where again we have employed the vierbeine on fm to atten indices. note however that when

 as the inverse vierbein on the dual manifold m we will denote its inverse

indeed just as complex structures (with one at index) can be used to dene a local lorentz
frame dierent from the frame spanned by the inverse vierbein, an interpretation of the killing
 as an inverse vierbein is possible as well. in this case, however, the manifold for
yano tensor er
rer
which the inverse vierbein is e
is a killing tensor which does not normally coincide with the metric on m). this observation
was rst elucidated in [5] and plays a central role in this paper by providing an example of
manifolds with mutually anticommuting dirac operators.

r is not identical to the original one given by e

r (the square e

at the quantum level one must study the possible orderings when making the transition from
a classical supercharge to the dirac operator acting on a spinorial hilbert space. for example,
we have already discussed this problem in detail in section 2 (there symmetry principles such
as general coordinate and local lorentz invariance of the index are central considerations). the
key observation of the previous subsection in this respect is the role of the coupling to the

d/ (e, a) are antihermitean on the manifold in question which necessitates the addition of the

bracket formulation of the killingyano technique. upon inclusion of the torsion trace one must
reanalyse the quantum anticommutator of dirac operators. in explicit examples we have found

trace of the torsion ev . needless to say exactly this coupling is absent in the classical poisson
that in order to obtain a vanishing anticommutator one must ensure that both d/ (e,ev ) and
abovementioned torsion trace ev .

unfortunately, manifolds which admit killingyano tensors are not nearly as well understood
as their cousins that play a role in d  2 extended supersymmetry: complex, kahler and hyper-
kahler manifolds. the most extensive systematic study so far was made in [38, 39]. though
very explicit, their analysis only concerns the local geometrical structure of manifolds admitting
killingyano tensors. lacking a systematic topological analysis, this information has to be
extracted for every example being studied. for this reason, we will in this paper focus on the
taubnut manifold [40, 41] for all sample calculations. it should however be noted that at least
the kerr metric is tractable as well; an extension of those results to include the kerr-newman
family could be used to study a generalisation of our results to include electromagnetic coupling,
although there are no conceptual problems expected there. the much simpler schwarzschild
metric only admits a non-invertible killingyano tensor, which therefore does not lead to a
non-singular inverse vierbein.

as well as the trivial vector

(4.17)

(4.18)

(there is also a fourth trivial killing vector k4 = []). for the computation of the bulk contri-
butions to the index, as reported in section 4.4.1, it is not very important to make this isometry
manifest and one can use an (almost) diagonal inverse vierbein based on the metrics (1.2) or
(1.3). it is, however, crucial to make this symmetry manifest in order to use the  invariant
computations for manifolds with s3 boundary of subsection 3.2. to achieve this one makes use
of the left-invariant forms i. these forms satisfy

lki =(cid:0)kd + dk(cid:1) i =(cid:0)ki

where lk is the lie derivative with respect to any one of the three killing vector elds ki.

1 dx = 1 = cos  d + sin  sin  d ,
2 =  sin  d + cos  sin  d ,
3 = cos  d + d ,

and they satisfy dk = (1/2)ijki  j. the metric (1.2) of taubnut then becomes

the connections and curvatures are all summarised in the two tables 5 and 6. before we
discuss the dirac operators, let us make a few remarks about the displayed results. first of all,
the curvature of the dual manifold is not (anti)self-dual, in contrast to taubnut (note that

in our conventions er rs = (1/2)rtsuer su). its asymptotic geometry is also dierent: whereas

taubnut is asymptotically a at metric, the dual metric has a volume element independent
of r at large radius; it tends to an innite tube.

of course, we must also specify the coordinate ranges for the angular coordinates ,  and .
it is easy to see that for both taubnut and dual taubnut one has   [0, ) and   [0, 2).
for the coordinate  one nds   [0, 4) by ensuring the absence of the nut singularity at
r = 0. in detail, one can write both the taubnut and dual taubnut metrics on a constant
()slice in the the vicinity of r = 0 as ds2 = dx2 + 1
4 x2d2 via the coordinate transformation
x2 = 8mr. requiring this be the metric of a two-dimensional plane in polar coordinates we nd

4.4 example: index theorems for taubnut and dual taubnut

4.4.1 bulk

using the geometrical data of the two manifolds we just presented, all terms in (3.32) can be
computed and the indices can be compared. let us start with the bulk part. for the dual
taubnut manifold there are contributions from all terms in expression (2.19) except for the
f  f term since f = da vanishes exactly for this example. putting the boundary at a nite
radius r = rb we obtain the (rather unenlightening) result

in the limit rb   this yields the number 1/12. if one turns the torsion o, the bulk resulk for
dual taubnut is then simply

rmn  rnm =

b (r2

for a boundary at innity, this produces the answer 1/12 (or equivalently a pontrjagin number
2). for taubnut it is known that this number, which seems to lead to a fractional index,
in fact gets modied by the boundary contributions [12, 13, 14]. because of the general results
discussed in the rst part of this section, we expect that a similar correction will arise for the
dual taubnut manifold as well.

4.4.2  invariant

the boundaries of taubnut and the dual taubnut are s3 so our general discussion for
the computation of the  invariant in subsection 3.2 applies. from (4.28) we obtain the dual
taubnut boundary operator

subsection 4.4.4 below. clearly the analysis of subsection 3.2 applies equally well to the taub
nut boundary dirac operator (4.39) and importantly the solutions still take the form quoted
in (3.18). therefore, for the taubnut manifold, we reproduce the results of [43] and nd

innite radius, rb  . on the other hand, the limiting value for 1
2(0) for dual taubnut
without torsion is 3/4.

finally we note that the number of harmonic boundary spinors h vanishes for taubnut

and dual taubnut with or without torsion.

4.4.3 chernsimons correction

for the dual of taubnut, we have computed the dierence q between the boundary integral
at innity for the product metric and the same integral for the full metric to be (the contribution
ada from the abelian axial vector eld drops out since in this example f = da  0)

since the dual metric is already a product metric at innity, one expects this correction to vanish

4.4.4 equality of indices

although it is now easy to verify the equality of the indices on the taubnut and dual taub
nut manifolds, it would be remiss of us to do so without rst checking the validity the assump-
tion of subsection 4.1 above. therefore we return to the solutions presented in equation (3.18)
and check that the eigenspaces generated by the solutions with positive eigenvalues coincide for
taubnut and dual taubnut. clearly the eigenvalues (setting z = 0, since z = r/(2m) 6= 0

(s = 1 for taubnut and s = (r+m)/m for dual taubnut) are always positive. furthermore,
from the form of the explicit solutions, we see that the eigenspaces generated by the correspond-
ing eigenvectors are clearly identical for both manifolds. if the solutions corresponding to the

corresponds to dual taubnut without torsion) p/2 + /4 and /4 +p4pq(s)2 + (p  q)2/2
negative root /4p4pq(s)2 + (p  q)2/2 were all to have strictly negative eigenvalues clearly
square rootp4pq(s)2 + (p  q)2 which occurs at p = 1 = q. but for both manifolds /4  s is

we would be done since the projective boundary conditions then coincide for the two manifolds.
yet for any non-negative radius r to the boundary, the eigenvalue with the negative root can
never be positive for either manifold. to see this we just need to look at the minimum of the

negative so long as r is non-negative which completes our verication of the assumption.

we are now justied in comparing the indices of taubnut and dual taubnut. there-
fore, adding the bulk contribution (4.31), the  invariant (4.37) and the chernsimons correc-
tion (4.41) of the dual taubnut manifold, we nd that the rb dependence drops out completely,

indexd/ (e, a) =

r8 + 12r7m + 86r6m2 + 340r5m3 + 753r4m4 + 872r3m5 + 408r2m6

12(rb + 2m)4(rb + m)4

r8 + 12r7m + 86r6m2+ 308r5m3 + 569r4m4+ 552r3m5+ 264r2m6 + 48rm7

12(rb + 2m)4(rb + m)4
32r5m3 + 184r4m4 + 320r3m5 + 144r2m6  48rm7

12(rb + 2m)4(rb + m)4





= 0 ,

(4.44)

(the  invariant has to be added rather than subtracted because our conventions for the gamma
matrices imply that the upper component states have negative chirality). this result matches
precisely the (well known) result for taubnut obtained by adding (4.33), (4.40) and (4.43) (it
is easy to verify that there is no additional contribution at any value of rb to the taubnut
index from the abelian coupling v ) and therefore

it is interesting to also compute the index for dual taubnut without torsion. in that case,
adding (4.32), (4.38) and (4.42), we again nd a vanishing result

indexd/ (e, a) = 0 = indexd/ (e,ev ) .

(4.45)

index d/ (e, a = 0) = 0

(4.46)

33

at any radius to the boundary rb.

even though the bulk and boundary terms decouple completely in the limit rb   for
both manifolds, this is not true for general values of rb indicating the non-trivial nature of our
result. moreover, the torsion terms in the various contributions yield a nontrivial answer which
matches precisely with that of the metric terms to produce the rb independent result (4.45). this
concludes our check of the aps index theorem generalised to manifolds with torsion.

5. summary and conclusions

in this paper we have presented the modications of the bulk and boundary terms in the index
theorems for manifolds with boundary when torsion is added. in addition we have shown how
the index theorem for such manifolds can be related when they possess mutually anticommuting
dirac operators. all these results can be explicitly veried for the case of the taubnut and
dual taubnut manifolds and we nd that the index for both these manifolds vanishes.

many important technical and physical issues were solved en route to the above results. in
particular the appearance of the niehyan tensor at order o(1) in the bulk index computation
has previously caused some controversy [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. however, once one studies well-
posed index problems by carefully imposing boundary terms for spinors, the index should be
independent of the inverse regulator (mass)2 . therefore one suspects that keeping all regulator
dependent terms in the aps analysis in the presence of torsion, all 1/ terms should exactly
cancel. the importance of this remark for the axial anomaly in quantum eld theory should not
go unnoticed.

interestingly enough, we note that the index for the dual taubnut manifold without
torsion also vanishes so that one may wonder whether on general grounds torsion should be
expected contribute to the index or not. we are not aware of any general argument suggesting
that torsion cannot contribute to the index of manifolds with boundary but from a physical
viewpoint the existence of such an argument would not diminish the interest of our results which
we now summarise.

the relation found between manifolds with anticommuting dirac operators involves the
in other words, one must must study the motion of spinning
so-called killingyano duality.
particles in curved space and in this paper we have extended existing studies of classical spinning
particle dynamics to the quantum case in backgrounds with torsion. the precise path integral
quantisation was given in section 2 and the resolution of possible ordering ambiguities for the
dirac operator by invoking anti-hermiticity was discussed in section 4. as mentioned earlier, our
work may also be viewed as a stringent check of the precise path integral quantisation scheme
utilised in this paper.

the relationship we found between manifolds with mutually anticommuting dirac operators
depended on being able to understand and compare the hilbert space of spinors on manifolds
with boundary. this analysis was made possible by the work of aps and we have shown that

34

it can be equally well applied to the torsion-full case also. in particular we note that in all our
analysis it was possible to take any nite radius rb to the boundary. this allows one to study
the non-compact limit in which rb   which of course has some topical signicance in present
day studies of anti de sitter metrics. the agreement we found between indices at nite rb is a
very strong check of our results.

the generalisations to include torsion that we presented of hitchins  invariant computation
for squashed s3 metrics and to gilkeys chernsimons non-product metric boundary correction
were in principle straightforward but are of course an important step if one is to understand
index theorems in the torsion-full case. we note that it would be desirable also to consider cases
where the antisymmetric contortion also has non-vanishing components in the direction normal
to the boundary. one might expect then that analogous results to ours would also hold. one
might also like to proceed in such a case by searching for other manifolds satisfying the killing
yano duality relation. to this end we note that the kerrnewman metric of a rotating black
hole is certainly tractable along the lines presented in this paper, but we reserve this physically
interesting metric for further study.

as a nal note we also observe that the generalised chernsimons form c =   r  1

3  
   + k found in section 2 (where, presumably one ought include the order 1 niehyan
term along with possible higher o() corrections in k) might represent an interesting three
dimensional eld theory in its own right. but again we leave such developments to the future.

acknowledgments

we thank jan-willem van holten for encouraging us to study this problem and indicating to us
that a relation between index theorems for manifolds with killingyano tensors and their dual
manifolds should exist. furthermore, we are honoured to thank gary gibbons, stephen hawking,
sven moch, diana vaman and peter van nieuwenhuizen for discussions and are deeply indebted

to nigel hitchin for providing us the derivation of the residues f(cid:0)(s + 1)/2(cid:1) and f(cid:0)(s + 3)/2(cid:1)

required in the  invariant computation [34]. the calculations reported in this paper made
extensive use of the tensor algebra package grtensor [44] along with the algebraic manipulation
program form [45].

a. conventions and general relativity with torsion

we work exclusively with manifolds of euclidean signature and our dirac matrices r are her-
mitean and satisfy {r, s} = 2 rs. flat (tangent space) indices are denoted by the lower
case roman alphabet whereas curved indices are members of the greek alphabet. products of
dirac matrices are denoted as r1rn = [r1    rn] where we (anti) symmetrise with unit weight
and 5 = 1
24 rsturstu = 1234 = 5. we will often employ dierential form notation in which
d = dx and at so(4) indices are usually suppressed and understood to be traced over.

we will mostly be dealing with torsion that is fully anti-symmetric, which we denote by
writing the symbol a

so we will not introduce a separate symbol for it. the axial vector obtained by dualising a is
denoted a

using (a.6) and the schouten identity. for the contractions of the riemann tensor, it is useful
to separate the pieces that only involve a christoel connection. when the torsion is fully
anti-symmetric, this leads to reasonably compact expressions,

r(g, a) = r(g) + 2 d[a] + 2 a

[a] ,

r(g, a) = r(g) + da

r(g, a) = r(g) + aa .

finally we note that although the spin connection, in all generality has 24 components which
decompose under so(4) as a 4 (the trace), a 16 (terms with mixed symmetry) and a 4 (the
totally antisymmetric piece), the dirac operator can only couple via the dirac matrices to the

the two 4s which one may interpret as the coupling to abelian vector and axial vector elds ev

and a respectively. therefore the most general dirac operator is given by
