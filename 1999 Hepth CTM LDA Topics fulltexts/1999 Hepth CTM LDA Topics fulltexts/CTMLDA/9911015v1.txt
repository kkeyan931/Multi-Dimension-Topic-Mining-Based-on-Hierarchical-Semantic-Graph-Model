abstract

we consider an exotic compactication of spacetime in which there are two
innite extra dimensions, using a global string instead of a domain wall. by
having a negative cosmological constant we prove the existence of a nonsin-
gular static solution using a dynamical systems argument. a nonsingular
solution also exists in the absence of a cosmological constant with a time-
dependent metric. we compare and contrast this solution with the randall-
sundrum universe and the cohen-kaplan spacetime, and consider the options
of using such a model as a realistic resolution of the hierarchy problem.

there has been a great deal of excitement recently over exotic compactications of space-
time, where our four-dimensional world emerges as a defect in a higher dimensional space-
time. this idea, while not new (see [1,2] for some past work on this subject), has received
impetus from the unusual suggestion of randall and sundrum [3] that a resolution of the hi-
erarchy problem might be forthcoming from just such a scenario. in randall and sundrums
original paper, spacetime was ve-dimensional, and our four-dimensional spacetime emerged
as a domain wall at one end of the universe; a mirror wall at the other end of the universe
plus a conformal factor dependent on the distance between the two was responsible for the
suppression of interactions relative to gravity on our visible sector domain wall. in a later
paper, [4], randall and sundrum explicitly demonstrated how the gravitational interactions
eectively localised on the hidden domain wall, by showing that a ve-dimensional universe
with a domain wall had low energy spin-2 excitations which were localised on that wall. a
more general calculation involving a smooth wall solution has been performed in [5].

a key feature of the randall-sundrum solution:

ds2 = e2k|y|dxdx  dy2

(1)

is that in order to have a static solution, a negative cosmological constant is required in the
bulk spacetime. the value of this cosmological constant, and the value of the wall energy
density are related in a precise manner to the ve-dimensional planck mass and k, the
constant appearing in the metric (1). without this precision balance, nonstatic solutions
would have to be considered citeis, see [7] (and references therein) for a comprehensive
summary of domain walls in supergravity.

domain walls are, however, familiar from another point of view:

in cosmology they
are one of a family of topological defect solutions which can arise in the early universe
during a symmetry breaking phase transition. generally, global defects are problematic
cosmologically, and it was realised very early on [8] that the existence of domain walls with
symmetry breaking scales greater than about 1 mev must be ruled out, because a network
of such defects would rapidly evolve to dominate the energy of the universe. however, as
model defects, they are particularly amenable to analytic study, and have some fascinating
properties, most notably that they cause spacetime to compactify [9] under their own self-
gravity. however, domain walls are not the only global defects studied in the cosmological
context, global strings and monopoles (as well as textures) have also been examined. while
the global monopole has a well-dened static metric [10], the global string does not. it was
thought for some time that this particular defect was singular [11], its metric having been
calculated by cohen and kaplan [12]. however, an analysis including time-dependence
[13] revealed that with the correct de-sitter like behaviour of the intrinsic metric of the
worldsheet dened by the global vortex, the spacetime could be rendered nonsingular. an
event horizon is present in the spacetime, and a compactication can also take place with a
mirror string at the other end of the universe [14]. the analysis in [13] however, was purely
within the context of einstein gravity in four dimensions in the absence of a cosmological
constant.

the similarities between the domain wall and the global string lead naturally to the
question of whether one can generalise the exotic compactication scenario of [4] to the
case of two extra dimensions by using a global string, rather than a wall, as was explored
recently by cohen and kaplan [15], who generalised their original metric [12] to allow for

2

arbitrary dimensional spacetime. this is distinct from the original extra-dimension scenario
of arkani-hamed et. al. [16], who regarded the two dimensional transverse space as being
compact, and sundrum, [17], who considered the compactication of the transverse space
as a result of the conical gravitational nature of n vortices (it is also distinct from the
spacetime considered by chodos and poppitz [18], who generalise sundrums work to include
a positive cosmological constant in these conventions). here, there is a single, global, vortex,
which asymptotically closes o the spacetime. however, the solution presented by cohen
and kaplan diers from the original randall and sundrum picture in a variety of ways.
the rst, and most obvious, is that their solution is singular, in an analogous fashion to
their four-dimensional global string metric [12]. secondly, they did not have a cosmological
constant, which was a key feature of the randall-sundrum set-up in order to obtain a static
solution. finally, for solving the hierarchy problem, randall and sundrum had a second
domain wall at the other end of the universe. in this letter we point out that it is possible to
remedy at least two of these problems: by adding a negative cosmological constant one can
obtain a static nonsingular solution, however, the third problem probably remains insoluble,
in that it is not possible to have a negative energy vortex. essentially the trick with the
global string is the same as with the domain wall - just as a negative cosmological constant
counterbalances the positive impact of the walls self-energy to give a static solution in the
brane-world, the cosmological constant can be chosen to counterbalance the global strings
tendency for cosmological expansion yielding a static solution.

we begin by considering a general static cylindrically symmetric system, rst examining
the solutions in the absence of the string. just as the wall acts as a junction between two
dierent branches of an anti-de-sitter solution in ve dimensions, we can derive an analogous
patching that we might expect our string to satisfy in six dimensions. we then analyse the
behaviour of the string spacetime exterior to the core, and show that there is precisely
one asymptotic solution for the global string spacetime with the required properties for the
brane-world conformal or warp factor. by integrating out from the core of the string it
can be shown that this does indeed match on to the physical vortex solution. the value of
the cosmological constant is, however, minutely small,   e1/, where  is the eective
cosmological constant on the vortex brane-world.
a global string is a vortex solution to a eld theory with a spontaneously broken con-

tinuous global u(1) symmetry, the prototypical model having a mexican hat potential:

l = ()

we will (for now) assume that spacetime has p + 3 dimensions, the vortex then being a
p + 1-dimensional submanifold of spacetime - a p-brane. by writing

 = xei

(3)

we can reformulate the complex scalar eld into two real interacting scalar elds, one of
which (x) is massive, the other () being the massless goldstone boson. in this way, the
low energy theory is seen to be equivalent in n(= p + 3) dimensions to an (n  2)form
potential. for example in four dimensions, the -eld is equivalent to a kalb-ramond b
eld, and the eective action for the motion of a global string is the bosonic part of the
superstring action.

a vortex solution is characterised by the existence of closed loops in space for which the
phase of  winds around  = 0 as a closed loop is traversed. this in turn implies that 
itself has a zero within that loop, and this is the core of the vortex. from now on, we shall
look for a solution describing an innitely long straight vortex with winding number 1.

it can be shown (see [13] for a general argument in four dimensions) that the metric will

in general have the form

ds2 = e2a(r)(dt2  e2b(t)dz2

i )  dr2  c 2(r)d2

(4)

where i = 1...p are the spatial coordinates in our lower dimensional spacetime. note the
presence of b(t) in the metric. in four dimensions this is crucial to obtaining a nonsingular
solution. in the absence of a cosmological constant it is also needed in arbitrary numbers of
dimensions to ensure nonsingularity, however, just as randall and sundrum tuned the bulk
cosmological constant to obtain a static solution, it will turn out that we can also obtain a
nonsingular static solution by tuning the cosmological constant (albeit in a far more sensitive
way).

first of all, if p 6= 1, b2 = b0, a constant. (if p = 1 then we have the canonical global
string in four dimensions, and the analysis of [13] largely applies.) one can then directly
generalise the argument of [13] to show that if b0  0 and   0 the spacetime is necessarily
singular. if b0 > 0,  = 0, the arguments of [13] also generalise to show that there is a
nonsingular solution which has an event horizon at a nite distance from the core.

however, we are interested in nding a static solution b0 = 0. we begin by analysing
the far-eld behaviour of such a solution. outside the core of the vortex, x = 1, and we see
that (5) can be rewritten as

setting 2 = 2(p+2)/(p+1), it is easy to see that the anti-de-sitter solution in these cylin-
drical coordinates has two branches represented by ce(p+1)a(= c p+2) =exp[r]. these
can be seen to be analogous to the two branches of the plane-symmetric ads solution
g = e4ky which the wall in (1) interpolates between. here, however, we do not have two
disjoint regions of spacetime, so we might expect that the global string solution (analogous
to the wall in (1)) should tend to the negative ads branch as r  , in order that the
spacetime is closed o and the volume integral converges. the core of the global string
will then be interpreted as a means of smoothing o the spacetime to make it nonsingular
at r = 0, just as the wall interpolates between the two branches of planar ads space. now
let us examine whether this is indeed the case.

rather than deal directly with the far-eld equations (7), we will instead, as in [13]

perform a phase plane analysis of the variables

hyperboloid by the grey line. as p varies the plot alters shape, but the qualitative features remain
the same.

the latter critical points are immediately identiable as the two ads branches, whereas the
rst two are quite distinct, arising purely because of the global vortex eld. we see now
that the global vortex can never patch onto an asymptotic ads solution (with convergent
volume integral) as the randall-sundrum domain wall does, since this asymptotic solution
is the critical point c
2 which is a repellor in the phase plane. instead, there exists a single
trajectory terminating on c
1 , which, for small , can be shown by an analogous argument
to that in [13] to match on to the core solution of the equations of motion (5), provided
the cosmological constant is tuned very precisely  =o(e1/). for  close to order unity,
this argument would need to be replaced by an (numerical) analysis of the full system of
equations. by referring to (12a) we see that this solution has a convergent volume integral,
while the transverse (r, ) space is in fact innite.

we therefore see that the global vortex spacetime, like the randall-sundrum spacetime,
is the warped product of a four-dimensional minkowski spacetime (with an exponentially de-
caying conformal factor) and an innite transverse (r, ) space, which asymptotes a cylinder.
in fact, at small and intermediate distance scales the solution is imperceptibly dierent from
the cohen-kaplan solution in [15]. it is only at the very large scale that the eect of the
miniscule cosmological constant makes itself felt, and smoothly rounds o spacetime to the
cylinder thus avoiding a singularity. therefore, although the solution does not asymptote
the ads branch that one might initially have expected by analogy with (1), it does have
an innite transverse space, which directly parallels the metric (1). it is also quite distinct
from other compactications involving two extra dimensions, which are either compact (e.g.
[16,17]), innite (e.g. [2], which also has electromagnetic elds and an innite volume) or
singular, such as [15]. since the solution is so close the cohen-kaplan exact metric, we

6

can use their results [15] to obtain an estimate for  if we wish to use this spacetime in the
sense of [16] to obtain a large four-dimensional planck mass. as cohen and kaplan point
out, a mass scale for the global vortex x-eld not too far above the electroweak scale (if we
wish to set the six-dimensional planck mass to be roughly at the electroweak scale) gives
a large hierarchy between m4pl and mew, this corresponds to   1/138 in our notation.
however, unlike the arkani-hamed et. al. [16] set-up, the extra dimensions here are not at
the millimetre scale, but are innite, it is the warp factor that produces the relationship
between m4pl and m6pl.

finally, there is one other option we could consider for the global vortex and that is
whether one can have a compact (r, ) section with a mirror vortex at the anti-pole. the
only way this can be matched onto a core solution is if we take the symmetric trajectory
through x = y = 0. in this case,  will still have the same order of magnitude, however, since
e2a returns to unity at the core of the mirror string, this does not represent a hidden/visible
universe as with the original randall-sundrum scenario [3] and cannot be used in that sense.
in short, while global strings are certainly interesting as an alternative to domain walls in
compactication processes, the minuteness of the cosmological constant, and its sensitivity to
the parameter  suggests that they would be problematic in any physically realistic scenario.
