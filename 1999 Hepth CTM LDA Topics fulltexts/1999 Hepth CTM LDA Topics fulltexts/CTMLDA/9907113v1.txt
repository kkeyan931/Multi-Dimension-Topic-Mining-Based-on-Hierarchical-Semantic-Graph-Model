abstract

we construct simple twistorlike actions describing superparticles propagating on a coset
superspace osp(1|4)/so(1, 3) (containing the d = 4 antidesitter space as a bosonic
subspace), on a supergroup manifold osp(1|4) and, generically, on osp(1|2n). making
two dierent contractions of the superparticle model on the osp(1|4) supermanifold we
get massless superparticles in minkowski superspace without and with tensorial central
charges.

using a suitable parametrization of osp(1|2n) we obtain even sp(2n)valued cartan
forms which are quadratic in grassmann coordinates of osp(1|2n). this result may
simplify the structure of brane actions in superads backgrounds. for instance, the
twistorlike actions constructed with the use of the even osp(1|2n) cartan forms as
supervielbeins are quadratic in fermionic variables.

we also show that the free bosonic twistor particle action describes massless particles
propagating in arbitrary space-times with a conformally at metric, in particular, in
minkowski space and ads space. applications of these results to the theory of higher
spin elds and to superbranes in ads superbackgrounds are mentioned.

1 introduction

conformal (super)symmetry plays an important role in the theory of fundamental in-
teractions based on eldtheoretical models as well as on the theory of fundamental
extended objects (strings etc.). conformal geometrical structure allows one to replace
spacetime geometry by twistor geometry, where twistors are fundamental conformal
spinors (su(2, 2) spinors for d = 4) and spacetime variables become twistor compos-
ites [1]. such a construction allows for a supersymmetric extension [2] where superspace
variables are replaced by primary supertwistor coordinates (su(2, 2|n) supertwistors in
d = 4 case).

in this paper we shall discuss twistors describing antidesitter (ads) geometry.
the isometry of the ads (super)spaces acts on the (super)ads boundary as the group
of (super)conformal transformations, and, therefore, provides the grouptheoretical basis
for the ads/cft (conformal eld theory) correspondence conjecture [3] which attracted
great deal of attention during the last two years (see [4] for an exhaustive list of references).
on the other hand the ads space is the one where higher spin elds may nontrivially
interact with each other [5]. in some aspects the technique developed for the description
of the theory of higher spin elds in minkowski [6] and ads spaces [7] resembles the
(super)twistor approach [8].

in this respect it is tempting to look for possible links between these dierent mani-
festations of conformal symmetry, ads spaces, twistors and their supersymmetric gener-
alizations.

motivated by the problem of nding a simple form of the action for a superstring
propagating in the ads5s5 superbackground [9], in recent papers [10] a massive bosonic
twistor particle model in an ads5 space has been proposed and its classical and quantum
conformal symmetry properties have been considered.

in [11, 12] an osp(1|8) supertwistor model has been proposed for the description of a
d = 4 massless superparticle with the innite spectrum of quantum states being described
by elds of arbitrary integer and half integer spins. the spin degrees of freedom of the
superparticle have been found to be associated with six tensorial central charges which
can extend the n = 1, d = 4 superpoincare algebra. it is natural to assume that the
superparticle with tensorial central charges and the particle on the ads space are dierent
truncations of the dynamics of a superparticle propagating in the supergroup manifold of
the isometries of the corresponding ads superspace [12].

an aim of this paper is to construct such a model in the supergroup manifold osp(1|4)
and demonstrate how it is related to the d = 4 twistor superparticle model of higher spins
[11, 12], and to a superparticle on the ads4 superspace osp(1|4)/so(1, 3).

another motivation of this study is to nd a way of constructing simple worldvolume
actions describing the dynamics of superbranes propagating in ads superbackgrounds,

1

i.e. to make a progress in solving a vital ads/cft correspondence problem [13][19].

using a suitable parametrization of osp(1|2n) (where n is a natural number) we have
found a simple form of the even osp(1|2n) cartan forms. they are only quadratic in
grassmann coordinates. this has allowed us to construct simple actions quadratic in
fermions for superparticles propagating on osp(1|4)/so(1, 3), osp(1|4) and, generically,
on osp(1|2n).

the most interesting examples of the osp(1|2n) supergroups seem to be osp(1|32)
and osp(1|64). in [21, 22, 23] 4 it has been shown that osp(1|32) and osp(1|64) contain
the supergroup structures of d = 11 mtheory and d = 10 superstrings. in particular,
osp(1|32) and osp(1|64) are extensions of the supergroups su(2, 2|4), osp(8|4) and
osp(2, 6|4) 5 which are isometries of, respectively, ads5  s5, ads4  s7 and ads7  s5
superspaces. reducing osp(1|32) and osp(1|64) down to the adssupergroups one may
hope to get simpler expressions for the cartan forms of the latter, which might simplify
the structure of actions for branes in corresponding ads superbackgrounds [13][19] 6.

the plan of the paper is the following.
in section 2 we review properties of the twistor formulation of bosonic particle mechan-
ics and demonstrate that the single twistor particle action generically describes particles
propagating in arbitrary spacetimes which admit a conformally at metric, such as at
minkowski space and the ads space.

in subsection 3.1 we consider the supertwistor description of a massless superparticle
in at n = 1, d = 4 superspace, and in subsection 3.2 we construct a twistorlike
action for the description of the dynamics of a superparticle in the superads space
osp(1|4)/so(1, 3). the action has a simple quadratic form in fermions and, hence, it
should not be hard to perform its quantization. however, in contrast to the bosonic ads4
superparticle we have not managed to nd a complete supertwistor version of this model.
in section 4 we construct a twistorlike action for a superparticle on the supergroup
manifold osp(1|4). this action is also quadratic in fermions, and upon an appropriate
truncation it reduces to the models of section 3.

in section 5 we describe a superparticle propagating on osp(1|2n) and show that it
preserves 2n  1 supersymmetries associated with grassmann generators of osp(1|2n).
the osp(1|4) superalgebra and its cartan forms required for the construction of the
actions are given in appendix 1. in particular, we present a simple form of the super
4 an osp(1|64)invariant superparticlelike model has been discussed in [23] (see also [24] and refer-

ences therein).

5we should remark that the notation osp(6, 2|4) is a somewhat confusing name for the ads7 quater-
nionic supergroup described, in a complex parametrization, by the intersection of two complex super-
groups su (4, 4|4) and osp(8|4; c), with bosonic sectors being, respectively, the spinorial covering of
o(6, 2) (spacetime) and the spinorial covering sp(2; h) = u sp(4; c) of o(5) (the internal sector).

6the cartan forms on supercosets of su (2, 2|n ) relevant to the construction of brane actions on ads

superbackgrounds were calculated in early 80-ths [20].

ads4 supervielbeins and spin connection which are polynomials of only the second down
in grassmann coordinates.

in appendix 2 we present cartan forms of the supergroup osp(1|2n) which can be

made quadratic in grassmann variables by an appropriate rescaling of the latter.

2 twistorlike bosonic particles

we start by recalling the form of an action for massless d = 4 particles which serves as
a dynamical basis for the transform from the spacetime to the twistor description. the
action is

s = z d a(m)a a

 a d
d

xm( ) = z mdxm( ),

(1)

where xm( ) (m = 0, 1, 2, 3) is a particle trajectory in d = 4 minkowski space, a( ) is
a commuting twocomponent weyl spinor and m

aa are the pauli matrices.

a a = m

from (1) we derive that the canonical conjugate momentum of xm( ) is

pm = m  pa a =

1
2

pmm

a a = a a,

whose square is identically zero since aaab  0 7, i.e.

pmpm = 0.

(2)

(3)

we therefore conclude that the particle is massless.

in the action (1) we can make the change of variables by introducing the second

commuting spinor

and its complex conjugate

 a = ia(m)a bxm  iaxa a

a = ixa b

 b.

the fourcomponent spinors

z = (a,  a),

z  = (a,  a)

are called twistors.

in terms of (6) the action (1) takes the form

s = iz d [ z dz + l( ) z z],

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

where we have added the second term with the lagrange multiplier l( ) which produces
the constraint

z z = 0.

(8)

7the twocomponent spinor indices are raised and lowered by the unit antisymmetric matrices ab =

ab, 

a b =  a b.

3

this constraint implies that a and  a are determined by eqs. (4) and (5). but, as we
shall see below, this at space solution of the twistor constraint (8) is not the unique one.
the ads4 space is also admissible, as well as any space with a conformally at metric.

passing from the action (1) to (7) we have performed the twistor transform, eqs. (2),

(4) and (5) being the basic twistor relations [1].

the action (7) is invariant under the conformal su(2, 2)  so(2, 4) transformations,
since the twistors are in the fundamental representation of the conformal group. the
choice of twistor variables demonstrates how conformal symmetry appears in the theory
of free massless particles.

we can generalize the action (1) to describe a massless particle propagating in a curved
(gravitational) background. for this purpose we introduce the vierbein oneform ea(x) =
dxmea
m(x) with the index a = 0, 1, 2, 3 corresponding to local so(1, 3) transformations in
the tangent space of the background. eq. (1) takes the form

s = z d a

m xm = z a
ea

ea.

(9)

note that  still transforms under a spinor representation of so(1, 3)  sl(2, c).

in particular, one can consider an ads4 space as a background where the particle

propagates.

let us mention that a dierent formulation of massive particle mechanics on ads4 has

been considered in [25].

2.1 the ads4 particle

to consider a particle in the ads4 background we should specify the form of ea
convenient choice of local coordinates and of the form of the metric on ads4 is

m(x). a

ds2 = dxmdxnea

meb

r(cid:19)2
nab = (cid:18) r

dxiijdxj +(cid:18)r
r (cid:19)

2

dr2,

(10)

where xm = (xi, r) (i = 0, 1, 2) are coordinates of the ads4, and r is the ads4 radius,
whose inverse square is the constant ads4 curvature (or the cosmological constant). the
coordinates xi are associated with the threedimensional boundary of ads4 when the
radial coordinate r tends to innity.

from (10) we nd that the components of the vierbein oneform ea = dxmea

m are

ea = dxmea

m = (cid:18) r

r(cid:19) a

i dxi +(cid:18) r

r (cid:19) a

3 dr.

(11)

note that the coordinates xi, r transform nonlinearly under the action of the ads4

isometry group so(2, 3) which is the conformal symmetry of the boundary xi

xi = ai

r = (2xiai

(12)

, aij

m , ad and aj

where ai
k are parameters of, respectively, d = 3 translations, lorentz ro-
tations, dilatation and conformal boosts, with i, mij, d and kj being the corresponding
generators of the so(2, 3) algebra (i,j=0,1,2) (see appendix 1).

we can now substitute (11) into (9). the action takes the form

s = z d (cid:20)(cid:18) r

r(cid:19) i xi +(cid:18)r

r (cid:19) 3 r(cid:21) .

(13)

let us try to carry out the twistor transform of this action in a way similar to that

considered above for the at target space. to this end we redene  as

the action (13) takes the form

a = (cid:18) r
r(cid:19)

a.

s = z d "i

2

 xi +(cid:18)r
r (cid:19)

 r# .

(14)

(15)

in the limit r   one obtains the twistorlike massless particle in threedimensional
minkowski space, i.e. on the boundary of ads4. the complex weyl spinor  describes a
pair of twocomponent real d=3 spinors which turn out to be proportional to each other
on the mass shell. in the limit r   the action (15) is still invariant under the d = 3
conformal group sp(4) = o(3, 2)/z2 supplemented by 0(2) rotations corresponding to the
phase transformations of .

in what follows we shall, however, keep r nite and make the change of variable

x3 = 

r2
r

.

then the action (15) formally becomes the same as eq. (1) in the at case

s = z d (cid:20)i

 xi + 3

 x3(cid:21) = z d m

 xm,

(16)

(17)

where xm = (xi, x3). the essential dierence is that upon the redenition (14) the
sl(2, c) spinors  transform nonlinearly under the action of the isometry group so(2, 3)
via the radial coordinate r.

we can now make the twistor transform of the action (17) by introducing

and combining  and  into the twistor

 a = ia xa a

z = (a, 

a).

(18)

(19)

the pure twistor form of the action (17) is the same as eq. (9), and, hence, it is invariant
under the group su(2, 2)  so(2, 4) of the conformal transformations acting linearly on
the twistor (19). the twistor z is in the fundamental representation of su(2, 2).

5

as it has been explained in detail in [10] for the particle in ads5, the linear conformal
su(2, 2) transformations of z induce nonlinear transformations of the ads coordinates
xi and r when the twistor components are related to xi and r through eqs. (14), (16) and
(18)

z = (cid:18) r
r(cid:19)

(20)

in the case under consideration we thus nd the nonlinear conformal so(2, 4) transfor-
mations of the ads4 space coordinates, with the isometry group so(2, 3) ( see eq. (12))
a subgroup of the conformal group. the conformal transformations of xm = xi, x3 (where
x3 was dened in (16)) are similar to the conformal transformations of the minkowski
space coordinates. they are

xm = am

 + amn

m xn + ad xm + am

k xn xn  2(xnan

k)xm,

(21)

 , amn

m , ad and am

where am
k are parameters of, respectively, d = 4 translations, lorentz
rotations, dilatation and conformal boosts, with m, mmn, d and km the corresponding
generators of the so(2, 4) algebra (m, n = 0, 1, 2, 3) (see appendix 1).

substituting the expression (16) for x3 into (21), one can deduce the explicit form of
the conformal transformations of the coordinate r. then the so(2, 3) isometry trans-
formations (12) of the ads4 coordinates are obtained by putting to zero all parameters
in (21) which carry the index 3, the remaining ones being ad and all those with three
dimensional indices i, j = 0, 1, 2.

the observation that the ads spaces allow to be conformally transformed is implied
by the fact that these manifolds are conformally at. for instance, the ads4 metric (10)
becomes conformally at upon the redenition of the coordinate r just as in eq. (16)
(which we made to perform the twistor transform)

2

ds2 = (cid:18) r
x3(cid:19)

[dxiijdxj + (dx3)2] = (cid:18) r
x3(cid:19)

2

dxmdxnmn.

(22)

we have thus shown that the twistor constraint (8) has two solutions which correspond
to the twistor transform of the at d = 4 minkowski space and of ads4, both spaces being
conformally at. this observation allows us to conclude that any other space whose metric
is conformally at should also arise as a corresponding solution of the twistor constraint
(8).

we now turn to the supersymmetrization of the action (9).

3 twistorlike n = 1, d = 4 superparticles

the form of the action (9) is suitable for a straightforward supersymmetric generalization.
to this end we should consider ea as a vector component of the supervielbein one form

ei(z) = dzm e i

m = (ea, ea, e a),

(23)

6

where zm = (xm, a,  a) are coordinates which parametrize a target superspace in which
the particle propagates. a and its complex conjugate  a are grassmannodd weyl spinor
coordinates.

3.1 a superparticle in at superspace

in the case of at target superspace

ea = dxa  iad + ida ,

ea = da,

e a = d a.

(24)

substituting ea from (24) into the action (9) we can transform it into the pure super-

twistor action by introducing the supertwistor [2]

and its conjugate

where now

and

za = (a,  a, )

z a = (a,  a, ),

 a = ia(xa a  ia  a)

 = aa,

 =  a a.

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

upon the supertwistorization the action (9) with the supervielbein (24) takes the form
similar to eq. (7) where the twistor constraint (8) is replaced by the supertwistor con-
straint

z aza = aa   a

 a + 2  = 0.

(29)

for further details on twistor superparticles in at superspace we refer the reader
to the papers [2, 26][32] and proceed with constructing an action for a superparticle
propagating in the coset superspace osp(1|4)

so(1,3) whose bosonic subspace is ads4.

3.2 the superparticle on osp(1|4)
so(1,3)

to get an explicit form of the particle action on osp(1|4)
so(1,3) we should know an explicit form
of the supervielbein (23), which is part of the cartan forms on osp(1|4). the components
of the latter can be computed using the method of nonlinear realizations [33][36].

the cartan forms of the supergroup osp(1|4) and corresponding cartan forms for
the supercoset osp(1|4)
so(1,3) were calculated in [37][40]. below we present simpler expressions
for the cartan forms which allow to write down a simple form of the ads superparticle
action, since our choice of the parametrization of the supercoset diers from that used in
[38, 40].

7

to derive the cartan forms on osp(1|4)

so(1,3) we take the supercoset element in the form

k(zm ) = b(x)f () = b(xm)ei(aqa+ a

q

a),

(30)

where b(xm) is the purely bosonic matrix taking its values in the coset so(2,3)
it
is associated with the bosonic ads4 space locally parametrized by coordinates xm. the
grassmann coordinates a and  a extend ads4 to the coset superspace, and qa and q a
are the odd generators of osp(1|4) (see appendix 1).

so(1,3), i.e.

the cartan form on osp(1|4)
so(1,3)

is

1
i

k 1dk = ea(z)pa + ea(z)qa + q a

e a(z) + ab(z)mab.

(31)

it takes values in the osp(1|4) superalgebra.

the oneforms ei = (ea, ea, e a) are the supervielbeins and ab is the so(1, 3)

connection on the coset superspace.

in the representation (30) the cartan form (31) is

k 1dk = f 1(cid:16)b1db(cid:17) f + f 1df,

(32)

where the purely bosonic cartan form b1db takes values in the so(2, 3) algebra and
describes a vierbein ea(x) and a spin connection ab(x) on the bosonic ads4 space

1
i

b1db = eapa + abmab.

(33)

depending on the choice of b(x) one can get dierent forms of ea(x) and ab(x). for
instance, the coset element b(x) can be chosen in such a way that ea(x) in (33) is the
same as in (11) and the connection ab(x) is

i3 =

1
r

ei, ij = 0,

(34)

(remember that the index 3 corresponds to the radial coordinate r of ads4).

we can now substitute (33) into (32) and calculate the explicit form of the super-
vielbeins ei and the superconnection ab, using a trick, described, for example, in [13],
or by the method presented in appendix 2. in the majorana spinor representation the
expressions for the cartan forms are given in appendix 1. in the twocomponent spinor
formalism the supervielbein form (a.15) or (a.18) of appendix 1 can be written as follows

ea = p (2, 2)hea(x)  iad  + ida i ,

(35)

where

p (2, 2) = 1

,

(37)

to get the action for the superparticle in the superads background we should simply

substitute (35) into (9).

s = z a

p (2, 2)hea  iad  + ida i

(38)

the polynomial p (2, 2) can be absorbed by properly rescaled  and , namely,  =
qp (2, 2). then the action takes an even simpler form which is quadratic in fermions

s = z a hea  iad  + ida i

= z a hea  iad  + ida  + 2ibc(x)abc i .

(39)

if in (39) there were no term containing the spin connection bc the action (39) could be
completely supertwistorized in the same way as we have done in the case of the ads4 par-
ticle and of the superparticle in at superspace. however, the term with bc does not allow
one to perform the complete supertwistorization of (39) in terms of free supertwistors, at
least in a straightforward way.

using the notion of killing spinors on ads spaces one can replace in (39) the covariant
dierential d with the ordinary one. to this end it is convenient to switch to the four
component majorana spinor formalism

 = (a,  a),  = (a,  a).

by denition (see, for instance, [41]) ads killing spinors satisfy the condition

(40)

where k 
(x) is a bosonic killing spinor matrix and c  is an arbitrary constant spinor.
if in (41) we replace  with  = k(x)k (where k  k 1) [14] the action (39) takes
the form

i
2r
or (upon an appropriate rescaling of  and )

s = z a(cid:20)ea(1 +

)  i akdk(cid:21) ,

s = z ahea  i akdki .

(41)

note that in (41) the variable k is regarded as independent, while  = k(x)k is
composed from k and the killing matrix k(x) whose exact dependence on the ads4

9

coordinates xm can be found by solving the killing spinor equation (40) [41]. taking
this into account, the term i akdk in (38) can be rewritten as i kbcdkk a
bc(x),
bc(x) are so(2, 3) killing vectors on ads4 (b, c = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 =1). then the
where k a
supervielbein

ea = ea  i kbcdkk a

bc

takes the form similar to one of the parametrizations considered in [38].

it would be interesting to understand whether the ads superparticle action in any of
its forms can be completely supertwistorized. if it is possible, the ads superparticle model
would acquire the manifest superconformal su(2, 2|1) symmetry. in any case, the use of
commuting spinors whose bilinears replace the conventional particle momentum and the
suitable choice of the parametrization of the supercoset space osp(1|4)
so(1,3) allow one to get a
simple form of the action for a superparticle propagating in the ads superbackground,
which is bilinear in fermionic variables.

4 the superparticle on osp(1|4)

we now turn to the construction of the action for a superparticle propagating on the
supergroup manifold osp(1|4) locally parametrized by the supercoset osp(1|4)
so(1,3) coordinates
xm and , and by six so(1, 3) group coordinates ymn = ymn. this model is intended
to produce, upon an appropriate contraction, the superparticles in at superspace and on
superads4 considered above, as well as the superparticle with tensorial central charges
[11, 12].

by analogy with eqs. (9) and (38), to construct the osp(1|4) superparticle lagrangian
we take the pullback onto the particle worldline of the even cartan superforms ea
osp and
ab
osp given in appendix 1 (eq. (a.7)). these forms comprise the bosonic so(2, 3) part of
the supervielbein on osp(1|4). we contract them with commuting spinor bilinears a
and 1
2

ab. the osp(1|4) superparticle action is

using the dening relations for the so(1, 3) matrices u a
redenition

b and v 

 (a.9) we can make the

b (y)a =

b, where

 .

(43)

then u a

b (y) remains only in one term of the action (42), and the latter takes the form

sosp =

1

2 z ea(x, )

a +

1

4 z [ab(x, ) + (duu1)ab]

ab.

(44)

we observe that the rst integral in (44) is nothing but the action (38) for the superparticle
on the coset superspace osp(1|4)
so(1,3) , and the second term contains the spin connection of

10

osp(1|4)

so(1,3) extended by the so(1, 3) cartan form duu1. in eq. (42) the dependence of the
action on the so(1, 3) group manifold coordinates ymn remains only in duu1.

since by an appropriate choice of grassmann coordinates the cartan forms ea(x, )
and ab(x, ) can be made quadratic in  (see eqs. (a.18) and (a.19) of appendix 1) we
see that the osp(1|4) action (44) is quadratic in fermions.

if we drop the second integral of (44) we get the action for the superparticle considered
in subsection 3.2, and if we then take the limit when the ads4 radius goes to innity, the
action further reduces to the superparticle action in at n = 1, d = 4 superspace.

another way of truncating the action (44) is to perform the following contraction of
the osp(1|4) superalgebra (a.1). let us in (a.1) rescale the generators mab of so(1, 3)
as follows

mab = rzab,

(45)

and consider the limit when r  . then the generators zab become tensorial cen-
tral charges which commute with all other generators, and the anticommutator of the
supercharges becomes

{q, q} = 2(ca)pa +(cid:16)cab(cid:17)

zab.

(46)

the so(1, 3) coordinates ymn become central charge coordinates.

in the limit r   the supervielbein ea(x, ) reduces to the at oneform (24)

and the superconnection ab

z = r(ab + (duu1)ab) becomes

z = dxa  iad
ea

ab

z = dyab +

abd.

i
2

(47)

(48)

substituting (47) and (48) into (44) we get the action for a particle with tensorial
central charges [11, 12]. the quantization of this superparticle model has shown to produce
a innite tower of free massless states with arbitrary integer and half integer spin, with
the spin degrees of freedom associated with the central charge coordinates ymn. for a
detailed analysis of the model we refer the reader to [11, 12].

since the higherspin elds can interact if they live not in minkowski space but in an
antidesitter space [5], it seems of interest to study the possibility of generalizing the
osp(1|4) superparticle model based on the action (44) to include interactions, and then
to perform its quantization to check whether such a model can be considered as a classical
counterpart of the theory of interacting higherspin elds.

to conclude this section we demonstrate that osp(1|4) covariant momenta associated

with the osp(1|4) coordinates xm, ymn and  generate the osp(1|4) superalgebra 8.

8in [44] similar covariant momenta were used to make the hamiltonian analysis and the quantization

of superparticles propagating in harmonic superspaces.

11

let us rewrite the action (44) as follows

s = z d iei

m (x, , z) x m ,

where i stand for the bilinear combinations of the spinor 

i = (cid:18)1

2

a,

1
4

ab(cid:19) ,

(49)

(50)

the index i stands for vector a and tensor ab indices, and x m  (xm, zmn, ). ei
m (x, , z)
are the osp(1|4) cartan form components ea and ab, which correspond to the bosonic
generators pa and mab of osp(1|4) (see appendix 1).

from (49) we get the canonical momenta conjugate to x m  (xm, zmn, ) as

s

( x m )

= pm = iei

m .

(51)

multiplying (51) by the matrix em
i
covariant momenta p i = em

i pm = (pi, p) such that

inverse to e i

m (where i = (i, )) we obtain osp(1|4)

i = pi  em

i (x)pm ,

p = em

 (x)pm = 0.

(52)

eqs. (50) and (52) imply that the expressions for the momenta are constraints on the
superparticle phase space variables. for instance, the momentum components p of the
grassmann variable  are zero. these are grassmann constraints on the dynamics of the
osp(1|4) superparticle, which include rstclass constraints generating the symmetry
of the osp(1|4) superparticle.

it is well known that, as n = 1, d = 4 superparticles in an arbitrary supergravity back-
ground do, the ads superparticle possesses twoparameter local fermionic symmetry,
which means that such superparticles preserve half the supersymmetry of a targetspace
vacuum.

in contrast to this, as we shall prove in the next section, the osp(1|4) superparticle
possesses 3 symmetries and, in general, the superparticle propagating on the osp(1|2n)
supergroup manifold has (2n  1) -symmetries and thus describes bps states with only
one broken supersymmetry.

in [11] the superparticle models with such a symmetry property have been obtained in
at superspaces with additional tensorial central charge coordinates. here we observe that
this unusual feature is also inherent to superparticles propagating in more complicated
superspaces.

because of the maurercartan equations (de  ie  e = 0) for the cartan forms e i
the generalized momenta form, under the poisson brackets, the osp(1|4) superalgebra,
which can be quantized by taking an appropriate ordering of x and p in the denition
of (52):

m

[p i, p j} = c k

i j p k,

12

(53)

where c k

i j

are osp(1|4) superalgebra structure constants (see eq. (a.1) of appendix

from (52) and (53) we see that upon the transition to dirac brackets the spinor

bilinears i (50) become generators of the sp(4)  so(2, 3) subalgebra of osp(1|4).

from this analysis we conclude that the commutation properties of the superparticle
covariant momenta reect the structure of the global symmetries of the osp(1|4) super-
particle action. to quantize the model one should consider the osp(1|4) coordinates and
momenta as generalized canonical variables, with commutation relations dend by the
graded osp(1|4) superalgebra (53).

the detailed study of the model based on the action (44) is in progress.

5 the superparticle on osp(1|2n) as a dynamical model

for unusual bps states

we now generalize the osp(1|4) superparticle action (42), (44) or (49) to the case of
the supermanifold osp(1|2n) whose parametrization we choose to be of the form (see
appendix 2 for the details on the osp(1|2n) superalgebra)
g(y, ) = b(y)f () = b(y)eiq,

(54)

where y = y are coordinates of the sp(2n) subgroup generated by symmetric opera-
tors m = m, and whose element is denoted as b(y);  are grassmann coordinates
and q are grassmann generators of osp(1|2n) transforming under the fundamental
representation of sp(2n), which we call the spinor representation, (,  = 1, ..., 2n).

the osp(1|2n) cartan forms are

1
i g1(y, )dg(y, ) 

1

i hf 1(b1db)f + f 1dfi = eq +

1
2

m.

(55)

to have the connection with the osp(1|4) case discussed in section 4 and appendix
1 we note that for n = 2 m can be written in terms of so(1, 3) covariant generators
pa and mab as follows

m = 2(ca)pa +

1
r

(cab)mab.

(56)

then the osp(1|4) cartan forms presented in (a.7) are related to  in (55) in the
following way

ea
osp = (ca), ab

osp =

1
2r

(cab).

(57)

the matrix c plays the role of the osp(1|2n) invariant metric.

the osp(1|2n) cartan forms (55) computed in appendix 2 have the form

e = d + id()p1(),

(58)

13

 = (y) + i(d)p2(),

(59)

where (y) are sp(2n) cartan forms, p1() and p2() are polynomials in c
(see (a.37) and (a.38) of appendix 2), and d is the sp(2n) covariant derivative

d = d +


2



(y),

(60)

where  is a dimensional constant factor in the osp(1|2n) superalgebra (a.20), which in
the osp(1|4) case (a.1) is  = 4
r.
 = p2, then for  we get the simple expression

the form of eq. (59) prompts us that the polynomial p2 can be hidden into rescaled

 = (y) + i(d).

(61)

the action for a superparticle moving on osp(1|2n), which generalizes (44), has the

form

s =

2 z

2 z d 



(62)

where  is an auxiliary bosonic sp(2n) spinor variable, and  = d 

of the even cartan form (59) or (61) on the superparticle worldline.

is the pullback

let us now analyse the symmetry properties of the action (62) by considering its
general variation. a simple way to vary the action (62) with respect to osp(1|2n) coor-
dinates x m = (y, ) and the auxiliary variable , is to use maurercartan equations
(integrability conditions for eq. (55)) d(g1dg) = g1dg  g1dg which imply

de +


2

e   

 = 0,

d +


2

   

 = ie  e,

and the expression for the x m variation of the dierential forms

 = id + di i  x m m .

(63)

(64)

(65)

modulo a boundary term the variation of the action (62) obtained in this way takes

the form

s = z  zm1 d i 

i

2 z (e)(ie),

(66)

where the basis in the space of variations is choosen to be i and ie instead of more
conventional y and .

note that ie corresponds to the variation of the action with respect to grassmann
coordinates . putting  = 0, i = 0 we thus observe that only one of the 2n
independent fermionic variations, namely ie, eects the variation of the action. this
implies that other 2n1 fermionic variations are fermionic symmetries of the dynamical

14

system described by the action (62). the symmetry transformations are dened in such
a way that ie vanishes (cf. [11, 12])

i = 0,

 = 0,

ie = i
i ,

i = 1, . . . (2n  1)

where the 

i are 2n  1 sp(2n) spinors orthogonal to 



i  = 0,

i = 1, . . . (2n  1).

(67)

(68)

thus, we conclude that an unusual property of a twistorlike superparticle with tenso-
rial central charge coordinates [11] to preserve all but one targetspace supersymmetries
is inherent to the superparticle model on the osp(1|2n) supergroup manifold as well.

when the explicit expressions (58) and (59) for the cartan forms on osp(1|2n) are
obtained, one straightforwardly gets the explicit expressions also for the cartan forms on
any coset superspace osp(1|2n)/h, where h is a bosonic subgroup of osp(1|2n). these
expressions are the same as (58) and (59) but with  depending only on the bosonic
coordinates of the supercoset (see also eqs. (a.40) and (a.41) of appendix 2).

using the osp(1|2n)/h cartan forms one can construct various types of actions for
superparticles and superbranes propagating on the corresponding coset supermanifolds.

6 conclusion

by taking a suitable parametrization of the supergroup manifold osp(1|2n) we have found
a simple form of the osp(1|2n) cartan superforms such that the ones which take values
in the bosonic subalgebra sp(2n) of osp(1|2n) are quadratic in grassmann coordinates.
we have used these cartan forms to construct simple twistorlike actions (which are
quadratic in fermions) for describing superparticles propagating on the coset superspace
osp(1|4)/so(1, 3), on the supergroup manifold osp(1|4), and, in general, on osp(1|2n)
supermanifolds.

the osp(1|4) superparticle model has been shown to produce (upon a truncation)
either the standard massless d=4 superparticle or the generalized massless d=4 super-
particle with tensorial central charges [11, 12] whose quantization gives rise to massless
free elds of arbitrary (half)integer spin.

we have also shown that the massless particle on ads4 = so(2, 3)/so(1, 3) can be
described (with a particular choice of twistor variables) as a free d = 4 twistor particle.
a direction of further study can be to analyse the osp(1|4) superparticle model in
detail and to look for its role as a classical counterpart in the theory of interacting higher
spin elds [5][8] requiring a nite ads radius.

another interesting problem is to generalize the results of this paper to the case of
superstrings and superbranes propagating in ads superbackgrounds with the aim to nd
a simple form of superbrane actions on ads. the simple fermionic structure of osp(1|32)

15

and osp(1|64) cartan forms, which we obtained, may be helpful in making a progress in
this direction.

the osp(1|2n) superalgebra and osp(1|2n) cartan forms
the generators of the osp(1|2n) superalgebra are a symmetric bosonic (spin)tensor
m = m ( = 1, ..., 2n) and a 2ncomponent grassmann spinor q, which satisfy
the following(anti)commutation relations

[m, m] = i[c(m) + c(m)],
[m, q] = ic(q),
{q, q} = m,

(a.20)

where c = c is a constant 2n 2n antisymmetric matrix (symplectic metric). note
that to have the correspondence with the form of osp(1|4) superalgebra (a.1) the factor
 should be chosen to be  = 4
r.

when n = 2

2 , c can be regarded as a charge conjugation matrix and q as a spinor
representation of a ddimensional pseudo-rotation group so(t, d  t) with an appropri-
ately chosen number of dimensions d and timelike dimensions t of spacetime.

for instance, when n = 16 the generators q of osp(1, 32) can be associated with
so(1, 10) majorana spinors in d = 11 or two so(1, 9) majoranaweyl spinors of the
same or opposite chiralities in d = 10. this makes the osp(1, 32) supergroup to be
related to mtheory and superstring theories. osp(1, 32) is a subgroup of osp(1|64),
and the two supergroups are extensions of the isometry supergroups su(2, 2|4), osp(8|4)
and osp(2, 6|4) of d = 10 and d = 11 ads superspaces [21, 22, 23].

from a perspective of d = 11 supergravity and mtheory the osp(1|32) superalgebra
contains the so(1, 10) covariant bosonic generators pa, mab = mba and ma1...a5 =
m[a1...a5]. a contraction of osp(1|32) produces the malgebra [42, 43] with mab and
ma1...a5 becoming tensorial central charges.

to compute the osp(1|2n) cartan forms we choose the following parametrization of

the osp(1|2n) supergroup element

g(y, ) = b(y)f () = b(y)eiq,

(a.21)

where remember that y = y are sp(2n) coordinates.

having in hand the osp(1|2n) cartan forms it is straightforward to get the cartan
forms corresponding to any coset superspace osp(1|2n)/h with h being a bosonic sub-
group of osp(1|2n). to this end in (a.40) and (a.41) one should simply put to zero
all parameters y corresponding to the subgroup h. then  will depend only on the
bosonic coordinates of the supercoset osp(1|2n)/h, and (a.40) will contain the even
supervielbeins and the spin connection of osp(1|2n)/h.
