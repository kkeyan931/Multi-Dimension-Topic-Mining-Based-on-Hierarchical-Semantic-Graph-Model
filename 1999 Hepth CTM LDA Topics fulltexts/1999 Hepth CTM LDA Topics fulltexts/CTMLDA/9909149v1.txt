abstract

we consider string theory on ads3 in terms of the wakimoto free eld

representation. the scattering amplitudes for n tachyons are analysed in

the factorization limit and the poles corresponding to the mass-shell con-

ditions for physical states are extracted. the vertex operators for excited

levels are obtained from the residues and their properties are examined.

i. introduction

string theory on three dimensional anti-de sitter spacetime has been extensively studied

in the past [15] as a toy model to investigate the consistency of string propagation on

background elds. this is an interesting example since it provides a realization of the kac-

moody algebra of sl(2, r), and is thus an exactly solvable model. renewed interest in the

subject originated more recently after maldacenas conjecture [6] which suggests a duality

between string theory formulated on adsd and a conformal eld theory living on the (d 1)

dimensional boundary of ads spacetime. the case d = 3 has attracted special attention

since the conjecture could be worked out in full detail and explicitly veried [79] in this

model.

however the structure of two dimensional non linear sigma models on non compact spaces

presents several problems. the quantum mechanical propagation of strings on ads3 is not

consistent. the usual virasoro constraints are not sucient to decouple the negative norm

states of the spectrum. several proposals have been advanced in the literature [25,10,11]

to render the theory unitary, but there is no general agreement yet. a no ghost theorem

has been proved for strings on ads3 at free level [12]. unitarity is achieved by keeping only

states with quantum numbers j bounded by the level of the algebra k (1 < j < k/2  1).

but this is not enough: a consistent string theory should provide a mechanism to avoid the

negative norm states at the interacting level, similarly as in at spacetime, i.e. non physical

states must decouple in physical processes. this implies that fusion rules should close among

ghost-free representations. moreover, while the spectrum of the compact current algebras

can be truncated to the unitary representations without spoiling modular invariance it is

not clear that this can be done in the non-compact case.

furthermore the ads/cf t correspondence implies a relationship between the conformal

weights of the elds in the boundary conformal eld theory, h and the quantum number j

labeling the states of string theory in ads3 [7]. consistency of the spacetime cf t requires

h to be real and this has led to ignore the ground state tachyon which belongs to the unitary

1

principal continuous representation j   1

2 + i [8], thus darkening the range of validity of

the conjecture. it is possible that the boundary cf t gives a more comprehensive description

of the fundamental degrees of freedom of m-theory, but it is important to ll in the details

of the ads/cf t duality map in order to completly understand the correspondence.

in standard perturbative string theory particles of various masses and spins are exchanged

in the dierent channels of a scattering amplitude. they appear as singularities in the ap-

propriate square momentum variable. one can think of obtaining all the physical states of

the spectrum of strings on ads3 and study their properties by analysing the scattering am-

plitudes of the lowest energy particles in the theory. the purpose of this paper is to address

this question in the bosonic theory, starting from the correlation functions of an arbitrary

number of tachyons. unlike string theory in minkowski spacetime, strings propagating on

the non-compact sl(2, r) group manifold have an innite degeneracy of states at a given

mass level. nevertheless the scattering amplitudes exhibit several similarities with the at

case. singularities occur when the points where some of the external vertex operators are

attached coincide. the poles correspond to the mass shell conditions for the intermediate

states and the residues reproduce the scattering amplitudes of the remaining tachyons with

the exchanged states. from this expression it is possible to extract the vertex operator

corresponding to the intermediate states, at arbitrary excited level.

in order to have a clear spacetime interpretation we consider the universal covering of

sl(2, r) which is topologically r2  r, because time is periodic on the group itself which

is topologically r2  s1. moreover we work in the wakimoto representation of the theory

in terms of free elds. in this formalism the string coupling constant depends on one of the

spacetime coordinates. therefore our results are reliable near the boundary of spacetime

where the theory becomes weakly coupled. however since ads is a constant curvature

spacetime it is reasonable to assume that the spectrum of states of the theory does not

depend on the region of spacetime where it is located. in principle one should be able to

nd all the possible states of the spectrum in this way (or at least all those that couple to

tachyons).

2

conformal invariance imposes constraints on the vertex operators which are automat-

ically satised when this formalism is developed in at spacetime on arbitrary riemann

surfaces [13]. in the case under consideration we have explicitly veried up to the second

excited level that the vertex operators obtained from factorization are automatically cf t

primaries.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we review string theory on ads3. we

summarize the sl(2, r) wzw model in terms of the wakimoto free eld representation

and discuss the spectrum of string theory in this background.

in section 3 we present

the tachyon vertex operator and the formalism that has been developed in the literature

to compute correlation functions, following closely [14]. we perform the factorization of

the n-tachyon scattering amplitude and obtain the poles corresponding to the mass-shell

condition for physical states. by analysing the residue we reobtain the vertex operator for

the intermediate tachyon state. in section 4 we study the higher order poles. we nd the

vertex operators for the rst and second excited levels and examine their properties. finally

the conclusions in section 5 contain the general form of the vertex operator for an arbitrary

excited level which can be expected from this particular factorization process. we discuss

the technical diculties faced in this formalism in order to give a denite answer regarding

the unitarity of the theory.

ii. strings on ads3

in this section we review some basic facts of string theory on ads3 in order to introduce

notation.

the sl(2, r) wess-zumino-witten model is given, in the gauss parametrization, by

s = kz d2z[  + e2]

(1)

this action describes strings propagating in three dimensional anti-de sitter space with

curvature  2

k , metric

3

ds2 = kd2 + ke2dd

and background antisymmetric eld

b = ke2d  d

(2)

(3)

the boundary of ads3 is located at   . near this region quantum eects can be

treated perturbatively, the exponent in the last term in (1) is renormalized and a linear

dilaton in  is generated. adding auxiliary elds (, ) and rescaling, the action becomes

[15]

s =

1

4 z d2z[  

2
+

r +   +    e 2

+

]

(4)

where + = q2(k  2). this action can be trusted for large values of .

this theory has a non-compact symmetry generated by currents j a(z) and j a(z), a =

1, 2, 3. in the following we discuss the holomorphic part of the theory because the same

considerations apply to the antiholomorphic part.

expanding in a laurent series,

j a(z) =



xn=

j a
nzn1

the coecients j a

n satisfy a kac-moody algebra given by

[j a

n, j b

m] = if ab

cj c

m+n 

k
2

gabnn+m,0

(5)

(6)

where the structure constants can be chosen as f abc = abc and the cartan killing metric is

of the form gab = diag(+1, +1, 1).

it is useful to introduce the complex basis (j, j 3) where

j = j 1  ij 2

,

(j) = j

and the kac moody algebra takes the form

[j 3

m, j 3

n] = 

k
2

mm+n,0

4

(7)

(8)

[j 3

m, jn ] = jm+n

[j +

m, jn ] = 2j 3

m+n + kmm+n,0

(9)

(10)

this sl(2, r) current algebra can be expressed in terms of the elds (, , ) using the

wakimoto representation [16]

j +(z) = (z)

j 3(z) = (z)(z) 

+
2

(z)

j(z) = (z)2(z) + +(z)(z) + k(z)

indeed, considering the free eld propagators

h(z)(w)i =  log(z  w)

h(z)(w)i = 

1

(z  w)

(11)

(12)

(13)

it is easy to verify that the opes of these currents realize a sl(2, r) level k kac-moody

algebra, namely

j +(z)j(w) =

k

(z  w)2 

2

(z  w)

j 3(w) + ...

j 3(z)j(w) = 

j(w) + ...

j 3(z)j 3(w) =

1

(z  w)
k/2
(z  w)2 + ...

the sugawara construction leads to the following energy-momentum tensor

t (z) =  

1
2

()2 

1
+

2

and hence the central charge of the theory is

c =

3k

(k  2)

5

(14)

(15)

this implies that k = 52/23 when the theory is formulated on ads3.

in general there

could be an internal compact space n (i.e. the theory lives on ads3  n ), and in this case

k > 52/23.

the spectrum of the theory can be obtained analysing the sl(2, r) kac-moody primary

states. they are labeled by two quantum numbers |j, mi, where

o |j, mi = j(j + 1) |j, mi

(16)

j 3
o |j, mi = m |j, mi

and o =:  1

2 (j +

o : is the casimir (the subindices refer to the zero-modes

o jo + jo j +

o ) + j 3

o j 3

of the currents). the ground states |j, mi satisfy

j a
n |j, mi = 0, n > 0

(17)

the complete representation can be constructed by acting with the zero-modes of the cur-

rents, namely

j +
o |j, mi = (j  m) |j, m + 1i

jo |j, mi = (j  m) |j, m  1i

(18)

it is possible to restrict the group representations by requiring hermiticity and unitarity.

hermiticity implies that j 3

o and o have a real spectrum, namely {m  r , j  r} or

{m  r , j   1

2 + ir}. notice that in order to have a clear spacetime interpretation we

work on the universal covering of sl(2, r). on the group itself m is quantized and restricted

to be integer. unitarity at the base requires [3,5]

m(m  1)  j(j + 1)  0

the unitary representations of the universal covering of sl(2, r) are classied as follows:

a) the principal continuous series with j = 1

2  i,   r and m  r; b) the discrete
series, dj with highest and lowest weight states having j = m, m  r; c) the exceptional

representation with  1

2  j < 0, m  r and the trivial representation with j = m = 0.

6

the excited states are constructed by acting with j a

n, n > 0 on the ground state

representation.

the string states must satisfy the virasoro constraints lm |i = 0, m > 0 and lo |i =

|i. the last one implies



j(j + 1)
(k  2)

+ l = 1

(19)

at excited level l. notice that this expression is invariant under j  j  1 and therefore

one can consider only states with j >  1

2 or j <  1
2 .

taking into account that the casimir plays the role of mass squared operator [5], the

mass spectrum of the theory is

m 2 =

(l  1)

2

2
+

(20)

therefore, the ground state of the bosonic theory is a tachyon, the rst excited level contains

massless states and there is an innite tower of massive states.

notice that the on-shell tachyon of the theory living on ads3 has j =  1

2  i92 and thus
belongs to the unitary principal continuous series. if there is an internal compact space n ,

eq. (19) becomes



j(j + 1)

k  2

+ l +  = 1

(21)

where  is the contribution of the internal part.

iii. interactions

in this section we discuss string interactions on ads3. the aim is to read the states of

the spectrum and their vertex operators from the residues of the poles in the combinations

of quantum numbers corresponding to the masses of the intermediate states.

as a starting point for the computation, the amplitude for the scattering of physical

particles has to be constructed. this procedure requires, as initial data, the vertex operators

of the external particles to be scattered. the natural objects to start with are the lowest

7

energy states, i.e.

tachyons. the tachyon vertex operator was originally constructed in

reference [17] by looking at the conformal dimensions and ope with the currents of elds

in the sl(2, r)k w zw theory, and it is given by

vt (j, m) =: jm(z)j m(z)e

2j
+

(z,z) :

(22)

where m  m  z is necessary for single valuedness. this vertex operator should be supple-

mented with an appropriate internal part if the theory is formulated on ads3  n .

note that this is a dierent representation than the one introduced by teschner [18].

the operator (22) corresponds to the leading large  part of teschners representation,

i.e.

it is suitable to work in the near boundary limit. as discussed in reference [9] these

operators can be thought of as fourier modes in an m  m expansion of the local elds of

the spacetime cf t . the large  approximation leads to incomplete results for correlation

functions [8,9]. however it is sucient for our purposes of extracting the short distance

singularities of the scattering amplitudes signaling the on-mass-shell states of the theory.

indeed, it is reasonable to expect that the spectrum of the theory will not depend on the

region of spacetime where the string is located (unless there were singularities).

we now review the formalism to construct the n-point function of tachyons. this

approach was developed in [14] and it is well suited to our purposes. the starting point is

the following scattering amplitude

aj1...jn

m1...mn = v ol[sl(2, c)]1* n

yi=1z d2zivt (ji, mi)+

(23)

where the average is performed with respect to the action (4). the antiholomorphic depen-

dence ji = ji and mi = mi is implicit in this notation.

the integration over the zero-modes of the elds leads to a charge conservation condi-

tion for non-vanishing amplitudes which can be achieved through the inclusion of screening

operators [19]. these operators were constructed in reference [17] and can be represented as

s = z d2w(w) ( w)e 2

+

(w, w)

8

(24)

therefore the amplitude (23) takes the form

aj1...jn

m1...mn = v ol1[sl(2, c)]* n

yi=1z d2zivt (ji, mi)(cid:18)z d2w e 2

+

where the gauss-bonnet theorem implies, at the tree level

s =

n

xi=1

ji + 1

(cid:19)s+

(25)

(26)

note that if the tachyons belong to the principal continuous series s will not be in general

a positive integer. however, the prescription developed in [15] for the equivalent situation

in liouville theory, consists in assuming that the number of screenings is a positive integer

and the correlators are evaluated by analytic continuation.

the integration over the zero-modes of the (, ) system leads to the following condition

(number of  f ields)  (number of  f ields) = 1

(27)

for non-vanishing correlation functions. in the case under consideration, this equation is

s =

n

xi=1

(ji  mi) + 1

from (26) and (28) the following conservation law is obtained

therefore the n-point function for tachyons can be written as

mi = 0

where c(zi, wn) and c(zi, wn) stand for the contribution of the (, ) correlators (see eq.(34)

below).

the corresponding expression in stardard string perturbation theory in minkowski space-

time exhibits some aspects of tree level unitarity.

it has poles for on-mass-shell states

and the residue of each pole factorizes as the product of tree amplitudes for subprocesses

1, 2, 3, ...m, j  j, (m + 1), ...n as depicted in fig.1.

figure 1: factorization of scattering amplitude

the physical singularities of the amplitude (30) can be extracted by considering the

region of integration where a subset of the n tachyons collide to the same point on the

world-sheet. unitarity requires also that the intermediate state j has non-negative norm.

we would like to check whether these properties hold in string theory on ads3 when two

external vertex operators coincide. in this case, the factorization should take the form

m1...mn  dvt (j1,m1)vt (j2,m2) vt (j,m)e dvt (j,m)vt (j3,m3)vt (j4,m4)...vt (jn ,mn )e

where the conjugate vertex operator v(j,m) is v(j1,m) [17], (j, m) are the quantum numbers
of the intermediate state and l  z.

the conditions for non-vanishing residue in this expression are the following

s1 = j1 + j2  j ; m = m1 + m2

s2 =

xi=3

ji + j + 1 ; m +

mi = 0

(32)

(33)

where s1 and s2 are the number of screening operators in the 3-point and (n  1)-point

functions respectively.

let us consider the particular case z2  z1 and take the s1 contours to encircle z1 and

z2 [19]. to isolate the singularities corresponding to the intermediate channels perform the

change of variables: z1  z2 = , z1  vn = yn, vn  z2 = (1  yn), where we have renamed

as vn the insertion points of the s1 contours.

in order to extract the explicit  dependence of the amplitude it is convenient to write

the functions c(zi, vn, wm) and c(zi, vn, wm) as

k = 0 (similarly (j2  m2)...(j2  m2  s1 + k + 1) for k = s1). the dots stand for lower

order contractions between the elds inserted at z1 and z2 and the s1 screening operators.

note that these functions can be written as a power series in  after performing the change

of variables and extracting the leading s1 divergence.

therefore, the tachyon vertex operator can be reconstructed, namely

vt (j,m)(z, z) = jm(z)jm(z)e

2
+

j(z,z)

(45)

with j = j1 + j2  s1 and m = m1 + m2 (recall eq. (32)). since we started with unitary

external tachyons belonging to the principal continuous representation, m1 and m2 can be

arbitrary real numbers and then m  r. the intermediate tachyon satises the physical state

conditions and its norm is unitary by construction. it belongs to the principal continuous

series with quantum numbers |j, mi = |j1 + j2  s1, m1 + m2i.

note that we could have started with external tachyons belonging to the unitary discrete

series. this is possible if a compact internal space n is allowed. in this case the conformal

weight of the vertex operator could be given fully by the internal piece, i.e.  = 1 in eq.

(21), and therefore the ads3 part could have ji(ji + 1) = 0, namely ji = 0 or 1 (and

14

for example mi = ji if the external tachyons belong to the unitary discrete series) thus

avoiding the continuous series. nevertheless string interactions still require an intermediate

tachyon from the principal continuous series, i.e. the factorization process discussed above

gives rise to an intermediate tachyon state belonging to the continuous representation when

the identity is taken in the internal part.

in fact, consider for example a free boson x

contributing a piece x to the external vertex operator (22) . the limit z2  z1 produces

a pole 2 from the internal part which modies eq. (40) to

2
+

s1(j1 + j2) 

2
2
+

s1(s1  1)  1 + n + l = 0

(46)

thus the intermediate tachyon, n = l = 0, has j = j1 + j2  s1   1

2  i,   r,

m  z, and the identity in the internal part when j1 and j2 belong to the discrete series

(i.e.  2j1
2
+

(j1 + 1) = 0 and, for example, m1 = j1).

iv. excited states

a. the massless case

let us now consider the rst order pole, corresponding to n + l = 1. both n = 1, l = 0

and n = 0, l = 1 contribute to (40) which can now be written as



2
2
+

j(j + 1) = 

2
2
+

(j1 + j2  s1)(j1 + j2  s1 + 1) = 0

(47)

when j1 and j2 belong to the principal continuous representation. recalling the discussion

at the end of last section, if j1 and j2 belong to the unitary discrete representations, either

dj or d+

j , then the intermediate state should also satisfy eq. (47) when we consider the 2

contribution to the pole (corresponding to the identity in the internal part of the intermediate

state, i.e.  = 0).

we thank j. maldacena for suggesting this possibility.

15

therefore there are two possible values for j, namely j = 0 and j = 1. as discussed

initially in references [25] and more recently in [12], some of all the possible states with these

quantum numbers have negative norm. in order to check the unitarity of the interacting

theory we will now examine whether ghost states are allowed in the physical process under

consideration.

take the residue of the rst order pole in eq. (39). consider n = 1, l = 0 rst. the

derivative of the function e, eq. (36), evaluated at  = 0 gives

(48)

the rst two sums in this expression can be clearly reproduced by the scattering of

(n  2) tachyons with a term of the form  2j2
+

(z1). the last two double sums involve a

dierent integration over yr. notice that the integrals over yr in eq. (42) can be evaluated

using dotsenko-fateev (b.9) formula in the rst reference of [19].

in order to evaluate

the integrals above which include one extra yr, note that the insertion (1  2yr) into the

dotsenko-fateev formula produces a vanishing result. therefore, the s1 terms containing

yr in the numerator contribute to the residue one half of the others and thus they can be

reproduced by an operator s1
+

(z1) scattering with the remaining (n  2) tachyons. the

vertex giving rise to (48) is then



1
+

(2j2  s1)(z)e2j/+ = 

j
+

(z)e2j/+

(49)

where we have taken into account that j2 = j1 and j = j1 + j2  s1.

another contribution to this residue arises when the derivative is taken on the rst term

of c(zi, vn, wm) in eq. (34), i.e. on the coecient of s1. an inspection of eq. (37) shows

that it is not obvious how to factorize this expression after taking the -derivative. however

the result greatly simplies when considering one of the external vertices which coincide

at z1, say vt (j1,m1), belonging to the highest weight representation of the unitary discrete

16

series dj , i.e. j1 = m1. in this case it is easy to reconstruct the resulting expression by the

scattering of (n  2) tachyons at zi with the operator

 (j  m)jm1

(50)

finally, let us consider the contribution n = 0, l = 1 to the residue. the term 1

evaluated at  = 0 can be read from eq. (34)

s1

+ ...}

(51)

where the dots stand for contractions of some of the s2 -elds in the screenings with the

-elds in the (n  2) remaining tachyons at zi. the last three lines of this expression can

be reproduced by an operator of the form (z1)jm+1(z1) scattering with (n  2) tachyons

at zi. in this case the rst line represents the three point function

< j1m1(0)j2m2(1)()j+m()

s11

yr=1

(yr) >

(52)

it is easy to verify that these correlators do not satisfy the charge conservation conditions

eqs.

(32), (33) and thus they vanish. this result can be generalized to arbitrary level.

notice that  elds in the vertices creating the intermediate states must be taken from

the screening operators, and thus these terms lead to violation of the conditions (32), (33).

therefore we conclude that only the terms l=0 contribute to the residues at all orders.

the vertex operator reproducing the residue of the rst order pole is then the following

v (1)
(j,m)(z, z) = [ 

j
+

(z)(jm)  (j  m)jm1(z)]  c.c.  e2j(z,z)/+

(53)

17

with j = j1+j2s1 and m = m1+m2. the coecients of the operators above play the role of

polarization tensors. they are of course particular ones obtained for the intermediate state

at the rst excited level produced when two external tachyon insertions coincide. moreover

recall that this particular operator is obtained when one of the external tachyons belongs to

the highest weight representation of the discrete series.

one could imagine more general polarizations, but the operatorial form of the vertex

operator in the wakimoto representation is given by

v = (cid:16)a(z)jm(z) + bjm1(z)(z)(cid:17)  c.c.  e

2
+

j(z,z)

(54)

it can be veried that this operator has conformal weight 1 when  2j
+

(j + 1) = 0, which

is the mass-shell condition, for any a and b. the ope with the energy-momentum tensor

contains a cubic pole whose residue (corresponding to l1|v >) is



2a
+

(j + 1)

and thus it automatically vanishes for the vertex (53) obtained from the factorization.

in order to compute the norm of the state created by this vertex notice that a level one

state can be written in the operatorial formalism as

v (1) = a0j 3

1|j, m > +a+j +

1|j, m  1 > +aj

1|j, m + 1 >

(55)

the norm of this general state can be computed using the commutators (8)-(10) and it is

n = 

k
2

a2
0 + a2

+[k + 2(m  1)] + a2


[k  2(m + 1)] + a0a(1 + 2m) + a0a+(1  2m)

(56)

in the case of a vertex of the form (54) the coecients are

a0 = 2

b+ + a(2m + 2  k)

+(k  2  2j)

a+ = 

a
+

,

a =

a
+

+

a0
2

.

(57)

and the norm is n = a2. for the particular case of the state obtained in the factorization,

eq. (53), it is then

18

n =

j2
2
+

(58)

therefore it is a non-negative norm state since j = 0 or 1. notice that the norm is

independent of m, thus this result holds for arbitrary external tachyons belonging to dj as

long as one of the coinciding vertices creates a heighest weight state. moreover the norm is

non-negative independently of k (recall that k  52/23) .

b. second excited level

the pole corresponding to the second excited level, n = 2, is given by



2
2
+

j(j + 1) + 2 = 1

(59)

again with j = j1 + j2  s1 and m = m1 + m2, therefore in this case j =  1

2 qk  7

4  r.

in order to extract the vertex operator for this state we have to perform two derivatives on

the function .

the - system can be easily analysed if we consider, as in the previous subsection,

one of the external tachyons belonging to the highest weight representation. one of the

contributions to the residue arises when one of the derivatives is taken over e and the other

one over c. this can be reproduced with the following operator

2j
+

(j  m)(jm1)e2j/+

(60)

which is basically twice the product of the two terms in v (1).

repeating the steps performed in the massless case, when the two derivatives act on

c(zi, wn) (eq. (37)) we obtain

(j  m)2jm1 + (j  m)(j  m  1)()2jm2

(61)

finally, when the two derivatives act on e(z1, zi, wn) we encounter a technical diculty

arising from the fact that there appear pr y2

r factors in the integrands of dotsenko-fateev

19

formula, which we are unable to handle. nevertheless, the operatorial form of the terms

reproducing this part of the residue can be read clearly, and it is

(a2(z) + b(z)(z))(jm)e2j(z)/+

(62)

the complete vertex operator at the second excited level is then,

v (2)
(j,m)(z, z) = {(a2(z) + b(z)(z))(jm) + (j  m)2jm1 +

+ (j  m)(j  m  1)()2jm2 + 2

j
+

(j  m)(jm1)}  c.c.  e2j(z,z)/+ (63)

it is easy to verify that the ope of this expression with the energy momentum tensor

corresponds to a weight one primary eld if the undetermined coecients a and b satisfy

the constraints

6
+

a +

4j
+

a + b = 0

a 

2
+

b(j + 1) = 0

(64)

corresponding to l2|phys >= 0 and l1|phys >= 0 respectively.

unfortunately, since we cannot extract the exact coecients produced by the factoriza-

tion we cannot give a denite conclusion about the unitarity of this state.

v. conclusions

we have studied the factorization properties of scattering amplitudes of n-tachyons in

the wakimoto representation of bosonic string theory on ads3. the pole structure appearing

when two vertex operators coincide on the world-sheet, reproduces the mass-shell conditions

for arbitrarily excited level.

by analysing the residues we were able to obtain the vertex operators creating physical

states and study their properties.

the tachyon vertex was reproduced for the ground state. in this case, the mass-shell

condition implies that the state produced by the factorization belongs to the principal con-

tinuous representation. this is so even though it is possible to avoid this series from the

20

beginning by considering a non trivial contribution to the external states from the internal

space.

the vertex operator creating a massless state was found in the particular case when one

of the external tachyons which collide to the same point on the world-sheet belongs to the

heighest weight representation. the norm of the rst excited state produced in this way

was computed. it is non-negative independently of the quantum number m and of the level

of the algebra k (recall k  52/23 in these models). it is interesting to note that this is a

general result, namely any massless state produced by a vertex operator of the form (54)

has non-negative norm. moreover the operator (54) is, to this order, the most general one

that can couple to tachyons. in fact, terms containing  elds cannot be produced in this

way since they lead to violation of the charge conservation conditions which are necessary

to obtain a non vanishing result.

finally we have found the general form of the vertex operator producing a state of the

second excited level. unfortunately we encountered technical diculties to determine two

of the coecients and therefore we are unable to make a denite statement regarding the

unitarity of this state.

the procedure which we have developed allows to obtain the general form of the vertex

operators for any mass level. at excited level l it can be written as the following sum

v (l)
(j,m) =

l

xk,l,n,p=0

aklnpn,0n(z)((z))kl(z)((z))pjmp1e2j/+

(65)

where k + l + n + p = l and the factor n,0 is included to cancel the contribution 0.

to conclude, in this paper we have proposed a method and developed the corresponding

formalism to deal with the problem of the unitarity of string theory on ads3. many interest-

ing questions remain. in particular, further work is needed to obtain the explicit coecients

aklnp from the factorization. this is important in order to settle the issue of unitarity in a

denite manner.

moreover it would be interesting to extend this formalism to the supersymmetric case.
