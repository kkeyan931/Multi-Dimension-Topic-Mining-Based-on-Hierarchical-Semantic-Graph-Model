(the discussion worldvolume interpretation string mass given nally section 3.) worldvolume theories discuss two cases: test d-4- brane test d-8-brane embedded parallel (a subspace of) worldvolume d-8-brane background{$9708147$}{$9708147$} (i.e. massive iia background). first, present two reasons choose background: one background one transverse coordinate, leading fact harmonic function depends linearly coordinate. case, obtain explicitly exact solutions worldvolumes without extra assumption (as see later). note obtaining explicit form crucial order nd mass formula hand discussions. another reason choosing background, see background via brane probes ref.{$9708147$}. supersymmetry preserved solutions using superalgebras massive iia supersymmetry, conrm solutions bps states target-space interpretation consistent. next, explain choose two worldvolume theories embedded ways: least one overall transverse space needed embedding (test) d-branes worldvolumes order obtain supersymmetric point charge solutions. case d-2-brane (a d-6-brane), intersection background d-8-brane string (a 5-brane) leads preservation supersymmetry, but, overall transverse space. d-0-brane adequate worldvolume description since world space. so, consider two cases, preserve moment 1/4 1/2 supersymmetry, respectively. concrete procedures following: two cases construct explic- itly point charge solution appropriate excitation overall transverse scalar eld. consistency interpretation solution fundamental string conrmed two ways: discussing behavior background limit previous paper{$9812014$} conrmed supersymmetry preserved solution branes worldvolume derived via superalgebras brane backgrounds (see also {$9708147$}). discuss bound states like (6|d6,d8) since d-8-brane solution singular d-8-brane hyper-surface. 3 checking preserved supersymmetry. then, propose generalized mass formula, examine whether gives geodesic distance multiplied appropriate tension string. moreover, also discuss condition mass string agrees energy dened d-branes worldvolume. organization paper follows: section 2 construct point charge solutions discuss mass formula. section 3 give conclusion discussions consistency interpretation mass formula notations paper follows: use mostly plus metrics spacetime worldvolumes. denote coordinates p-branes worldvolume i, j, ..

(2.6) killing spinor (2.4) form = h /80 0 denite chirality, i.e. y0 = +0 > 0 y0 = 0 < 0. rst consider point charge solution d-4-brane worldvolume parallel background d-8-brane. since solutions construct bosonic one, set fermionic coordinates zero. moreover, consider ansatz r dened r q4 xi = x5, x6, x7, x8 : = y(r) > 0 v0 = v0(r), (i = 0, 1, , 4) constants vi = 0 (2.7) i=1(i)2. note upper two columns (2.7) mean d-4-brane embedded 1234-hyper-plane. is, target-space point view, consider following intersection three branes: choose = 1 paper. 5 background d8 (at = 0): worldvolume d4 (at = y0): fundamental string : 0 0 0 1 1 - 2 2 - 3 3 - 4 4 - 5 - - 6 - - 7 - - 8 - - - - 9 y0 positive constant (and x9 = y). then, since vi = = 0, sw z d4 contribute equations motion, equations motion solve given lbi xm = i, lbi vi = j. so, let us examine lbi induced worldvolume metric gij given gij = h /2 0 0 h /2  ! , (2.8) (2.9) whose determinant detgij = h 5/2. moment, det (gij + fij) arising lbi complicated. however, setting condition iy = iv0, (2.10) results simple form determinant: det(gij +fij) = h 5/2. then, equations motion (2.8) become following two simple equations i(h 32iy) = 0 i(h 21iy) = 0. xi xi (2.11) (2.12) ((2.11) arises 9th component former (2.8), (2.12) time com- ponent latter (2.8), others solved.) so, requiring two equations compatible, needs hold = 1, two combined one equation (2.13) i(hiy) = 0. xi note harmonic function gives nontrivial contribution (2.13), means equations motion d-4-brane worldvolume aected background d-8-brane. using (2.5) > 0, equation (2.13) written (i)2(y + c1 )2 = 0. xi (2.14) shown supersymmetry preserved case without (2.10), using superalgebra via brane probe appearing later (eq.(2.20)). so, (2.10) considered correspond bps condition. 6 choose boundary condition ( y0 (> 0) v0 0 (2.15) r , means d-4-brane lies = y0. then, solution obtained, following unusual form, y(r) = 1/2 c1 c2 r2 ]1/2 ( + y0) (2.16) c2 constant proportional electric charge gauge eld. electric charge q1 dened {$9709027$} q1 = zs3 (2.17) sn n-sphere, worldvolume hodge dual 2-form dened dij = 1 . then, ld4 fij t4 q1 = zs3 (hdv ) = mc23 (2.18) n volume unit n-sphere. note denition string coupling gs = e included q1 since lbi d4 proportional inverse gs. since solution obtained explicitly, next give pieces evidence solution corresponds fundamental string ending d-4-brane. first, discuss massless limit solution (2.16). assume charge q1 independent m. (the validity assumption discussed later.) then, massless limit (2.6), solution (2.16) (2.18) behaves q1 23r2 y0 + q1 v0 23r2 . (2.19) right hand side (2.19) exactly solution d-4-branes worldvolume 10d spacetime, corresponds fundamental string{$9708147$}. so, expected correspond fundamental string. next, check preserved supersymmetry solution using superalgebras brane backgrounds via brane probes{$9708147$}{$9708147$}{$9812014$}. superalgebra d-8 brane background via d-4-brane probe given ref. {$9708147$} {q+ d4 (c) + 2zm4 } = 2zm4 , q+ d4p (0)iiy(cy11) h 5/4dx1..dx4(c1..411) + 2t4zm4 h 5/4(dv )2(c11) + o(2) 2t4 + 4! zm4 +2t4zm4 h 5/4dxdydv (cy) (2.20) 7 = 1+ q+ d-p-brane. p (0)i almost equivalent conjugate momentum vi. contributions chern-simons term subtracted.) substituting solution 2 q supercharge preserved (2.4) mp worldspace (the right hand side (2.20), superalgebra written , q+ {q+ } = 4t4zm4 d4 .(2.21) since three gamma matrix products y,c123411 cy11 (arising (2.21)) com- mute other, simultaneously diagonalized. since square matrix product equal identity traceless, matrices 1+c123411 projection operators. so, conclude solution 1+c y11 2 2 1/8 supersymmetry, hence consistent target-space interpretation. also shows solution bps state. now, discuss mass string. let us rst consider energy solution. purpose, pass hamiltonian formalism done ref.{$9708147$}. assume v purely electric scalar excited, sd4 reduces sd4 = t4z d5q{1 h(f0i)2}{1 + h(iy)2} + h 2(f0iiy)2 h y2 (2.22) (where h harmonic function). canonical momenta vi, dened respectively t4h p = = q{1 h(f0i)2}{1 + h(iy)2} + h 2(f0iiy)2 h y2 q{1 h(f0i)2}{1 + h(iy)2} + h 2(f0iiy)2 h y2 t4h . (2.23) hamiltonian h constructed h rm4 d4h h hamiltonian density given h = t4q{1 + h(iy)2}(1 + 2 4 h 1p 2) + 2 4 h 1(i)2 + 2 4 (iiy)2. (2.24) note subject constraint ii = 0. substituting solution (2.16) h, obtain energy solution e dened worldvolume. note bps solution like case, generically happens square root h becomes perfect square energy becomes sum two parts: part originating d-p-brane string. so, denote rst part h h1 second part h2. concretely, energy case takes form (2.25) d4 e1 + e2. e = t4zm4 8 rst term e1 energy d-4-brane itself, second term e2 energy excitation (i.e. string), dened worldvolume. since interested second part, compute e2 here. e2 innite case, regularize introducing small parameter , get energy r e2 = t4z d3z = t4q1(y() y0). r3dr(c1 + my(r))(iy(r))2 (2.26) is, energy (again) proportional dierence coordinate. thus, conclude energy dened branes worldvolume agree mass string case d-branes curved backgrounds. note result rather reasonable, sense, case g00 6= 1, energy transformation property 0 reparametrization 0. now, construct mass formula. since invariant reparametriza- tion 0, propose generalized mass formula string described solution d-p-branes worldvolume, = zmp dpqg00h2 (2.27) h2 second part hamiltonian density dened d-p-brane (origi- nating excitation corresponding string). let us calculate mass string case, based formula. substituting solution (2.27), nd m() = t4zm4 = 4t4q1 5m d4h 5/4(iy)2 = t4z d3z . r3dr(c1 + my(r))5/4(iy)2 (2.28) hand, geodesic distance l d-4-brane (lying y0) point parametrized y() given l(y(); y0) z y() y0 gyydy = 4 5 m1/4. (2.29) so, obtain proportional relation: = t4q1 l(y(); y0). (2.30) furthermore, show coecient t4q1 reproduces tension fundamental string correctly. derive this, discuss unit electric charge (1,0) (i.e. fundamental) string. first, review discussion case point charge 9 solutions d-p-brane spacetime{$9708147$} (and ref.{$9708147$}). let us consider triple junction strings: (0,1) string, (n,0) string (n,1) string. string coupling gs small, holds t(0,1) = (gs)2n2 2 (2.31) t(p,q) tension (p,q) string additional tension t(n,1) t(0,1). hand, solution d-1-brane worldvolume corresponding string junction given ref.{$9708147$}. background ansatz x0 = 0, x1 = 1, x9 = y(1), xm = constant m=2,..,8, = 0, d-1-brane action written sd1 = t1 gs z d2q1 + (1y)2 (f01)2 (0y)2. (2.32) solution d-1-branes worldvolume triple string junction electric charge q1 is{$9708147$} y(1) = v0(1) = ( q11 0 1 > 0 1 < 0. (2.33) energy solution computed using hamiltonian, additional tension also derived correctly. taking account bending (n,1) string{$9708147$}, obtained /t(0,1) = (1/2)(f01)2. comparing (2.31), charge quantization condition f01 = q1 = gsn deduced point charge q1 (for integer n). t-dualizing respect directions xm m=2,..,8, charge quantization condition electric point charge q1 d-p-branes worldvolume shown q1 1 (2)p1 zsp1 f0r = gsn. (2.34) next, discuss case related t-duality case (2.16). let us suppose d-1-brane parallel subspace worldvolume d-5-brane background, number n fundamental strings absorbed d-1-brane. (this also bps conguration since 1/8 spacetime supersymmetry preserved{$9711130$}.) consider d-5-brane background solution, string coupling gs becomes local function transverse coordinates ya (gs = e = h 1/2 h harmonic function ya), tention t(n,1). test d-1-brane put near d-5-brane, string coupling gs considered suciently small around d-1-brane. so, equation (2.31) gs = h 1/2 holds basis discussion. 10 hand, suppose electric point charge q excitation scalar eld y9. then, d-1-brane action 1 added d-1-branes worldvolume sd1 = t1z d2q1 + h(1y9)2 h(f01)2 h(0y9)2. (2.35) assume existence correponding point charge solution, additional tension due eld strength derived way, t(0,1) = 1 2(t1)2 h 1(1)2 = 1 2 h(f01)2. (2.36) so, comparing (2.31) charge quantization condition h 1/2f01 = ngs integer n. using electric induction d01 = 1 (= hf01 case) rewritten generic form t1 ld1 f01 d01 = n. (2.37) higher dimensional d-brane cases related (2.37) t-dualities. so, 1 (2)p1 zsp1 d0r = n. (2.38) generalized charge quantization condition point charge d-p- brane parallel worldvolume d-(p+4)-brane background. let us return case (2.16). left hand side (2.38) p = 4 equivalent charge q1 (2.16) multiplied 1/(2)3. so, unit charge q1 (1,0) string case q1 = (2)3. is, unit charge one case background, (this result consistent physical point view, since unit charge q1 considered independent background.) thus, proportional coecient (2.30) (1,0) string obtained t4q1 = 1/2, exactly tension string. so, quantity dened (2.27) certainly gives mass string correctly ! another case, consider case test d-8-brane parallel background d-8-brane. worldvolume action given (2.1) p=8. case, consider ansatz r dened r qp8 c (9) sw z xi = = y(r)(> 0) v0 = v0(r), (i = 0, 1, , 8) vi = 0. d8 contribute equations motion ( c (9) i=1(i)2. then, combined = 0, term including 01..8 = h ). expression note background elds also transformed t-dualities simultaneously. 11 induced worldvolume metric gij (2.9) except range indices (in case i, j = 1, 2, .., 8). setting condition (2.10) makes determinant (gij +fij) simple, det(gij +fij) = h 9/2. then, nd equations motion (2.39) i(h 22iy) = 0 i(h 1iy) = 0. (2.40) xi xi so, two equations compatible = 1, equations solve become single equation (i)2y = 0. xi (2.41) note unlike d-4-brane case, harmonic function h appear (2.41). so, choosing boundary condition (2.15), solution obtained easily c 2 r6 = y0 + v0 = c 2 r6 (2.42) 2 constant proportional electric charge solution. using c denition charge similar (2.17), electric charge q 1: q 1 1 t8 zs7 ( ld4 fij ) = zs7 (dv ) = 6c 27. (2.43) note form point charge solution (2.42) completely d-8-brane worldvolume background. here, derive preserved supersymmetry solution (2.42) way. 1/4 supersymmetry expected preserved. superalgebra d-8 brane back- ground via d-8-brane probe is{$9708147$} , q+ {q+ } = 2zm8 + 2t8 5! zm8 +2t8zm8 h 5/4dx1..dx5dydv (c1..5y) + h 5/4dxdy(dv )3(cy) + 2t8zm8 d8p (0)iiy(cy11) 2t8 d8 (c) + 2zm8 4! zm8 h 5/4(dv )4(c11) + o(2). h 5/4dx1..dx4(dv )2(c1..411) (2.44) momentum includes following two terms: = (0) + t8 8! h 2my0i1..i8i1x1..i8x81..8y (2.45) 12 contribution sbi d8 (where 01..8 = 1). (0) substituting solution right hand side (2.44), superalgebra written d8 second term sw z , q+ {q+ } = 4t8zm8 d8 h 1/4(iy)2( 1 + cy11 2 ). (2.46) discussion done d-4-brane case, shown 1/4 supersymmetry preserved conguration, consistent spacetime interpretation. so, interpret solution (2.42) fundamental string again. applying mass formula (2.27) case, obtain result: zm8qg00h2 = t8zm8 d8h 1/4(iy)2 r7dr(c1 + my(r))1/4(iy)2 = t8z d7z = t8q 1 l(y(); y0). (2.47) based discussion done d-4-brane case, unit electric charge 1 = (2)7. so, q tension string reproduced correctly again, (2.27) also gives mass 1 (1,0) string ending d-8-brane also derived q string solution (2.42) correctly. therefore, conclude (2.42) correctly generalized mass formula, holds background d-brane curved. note energy dened worldvolume gives dierence coordinate multiplied t8q 1. is, case another example worldvolume energy agree mass string. 3 summary discussions summary, proposed (2.42) generalized mass formula holds background d-brane curved, shown explicitly using two examples formula certainly gives mass fundamental string described bps solution d-branes worldvolume. addition, based obtained formula, see mass string agrees worldvolume energy cases g00 = 1 (where gij induced worldvolume metric). include case discussed ref.{$9708147$}. here, discuss consistency mass formula another point view, especially focusing factor g00. suppose consider d-4-brane embedded parallel d-8-brane background (2.4) excitation worldvolume elds (i.e. xi = i=0,..,4 x5, .., x8, : constants). then, analogy mass formula 13 (p,q) string given sen ref.{$9708147$}, target-space mass md4 d-4-brane proportional spatial volume element measured geodesic distances spacetime. so, given md4 = zm4 d4t4eqdetg ij (3.1) ij induced world-space metric d-4-brane. g obtained way shown agree quantity md4 dened fact, mass md4 md4 = zm4 d4qg00h1(= zm4 d4h 1/4 1) (3.2) h1 rst part (i.e. originating d-4-brane) hamiltonian density solution (2.16) dened d-4-brane. means information d- 4-brane mass also extracted solution (2.16) integrating hamiltonian density multiplied factor g00 respect world-space coordinates. thus, factor g00 arising formula consistent sense, too. dene worldvolume proper time g00d0, hamiltonian density multiplied g00 might regarded energy density dened respect . finally, let us discuss worldvolume interpretation mass formula (2.27). so, might say worldvolume point view, mass string interpreted energy dened respect worldvolume proper time. acknowledgement would like thank taro tani useful discussions encouragement. would also like thank y. imamura, tsunehide kuroki shinya tamura useful discussions computing energy solution.
