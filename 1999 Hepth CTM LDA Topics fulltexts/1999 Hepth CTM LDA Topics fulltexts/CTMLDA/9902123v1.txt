abstract

we consider the ads/cft correspondence for theories with a chern-simons
term in three dimensions. we nd the two-point functions of the boundary
conformal eld theories for the proca-chern-simons theory and the self-dual
model. we also discuss particular limits where we nd the two-point function of
the boundary conformal eld theory for the maxwell-chern-simons theory. in
particular our results are consistent with the equivalence between the maxwell-
chern-simons theory and the self-dual model.

1 introduction

since the proposal of maldacenas conjecture that the large n limit of a certain con-
formal eld theory (cft) in a d-dimensional space is a boundary theory of string/m
theory on adsd+1  k (where k is a suitable compact space) [1], an intensive work
has been devoted to understand all of its implications. in particular, a precise form to
the conjecture has been given in [2][3]. their suggestion is that the partition function
for a eld theory on adsd+1, considered as the functional of the asymptotic value of
the eld on the boundary, is the generating functional for the correlation functions in
the cft on the boundary. schematically,

zads[0] = z0 d exp (i[])  zcf t [0] = (cid:28)exp(cid:18)z

ddxo0(cid:19)(cid:29)

(1)

where 0 is the boundary value of  which couples to the boundary cft operator o.
this allows us to obtain the correlation functions of the boundary cft theory in d
dimensions by calculating the partition function on the adsd+1 side.

the ads/cft correspondence has been studied for scalar elds [4], massive vector
elds [5][6], spinor elds [5][7][8], rarita-schwinger eld [9], classical gravity [10] and
type iib string theory [11][12]. in this work we discuss the ads3/cf t2 correspondence
for vector eld theories including a chern-simons term. in section 2 we deal with the
proca-chern-simons theory. an explicit expression for the two-point function of the
boundary cft is obtained, and particular limits are studied. we then obtain the
two-point function for the maxwell-chern-simons theory [13].
in section 3 we deal
with the self-dual model [14]. since it is described by a rst order lagrangian the
classical action vanishes on-shell. as in the case involving spinors [5][7][8][9] the only
contribution comes from a surface term which does not vanish on-shell. an expression
for the two-point function of the boundary cft is then obtained. there is a well known
equivalence between the self-dual model and the maxwell-chern-simons theory [15].
we nd that the resulting two-point functions of the corresponding boundary cfts
are consistent with this equivalence.

2 the proca-chern-simons theory

since we are going to consider the euclidean version of ads3 we start with the euclidean
signature lagrangian for the proca-chern-simons theory which is given by

lp cs =

ff

where f = a  a and  is the levicivita tensor density with 012 = 1.
the eld equations which follow from eq.(2) are

f   m2a  i

1
g

a = 0,

which implies

a = 0.

solving eqs.(3,4) in the ads3 background is dicult due to the presence of the levi
civita tensor density. however it can be eliminated in the following way. using eq.(4)
in eq.(3) we get

(cid:18)2  m2 

r

3(cid:19) a  if  = 0,

(5)

where f  = 1
2
eq.(3) by the levicivita tensor density and using again eq.(4) we get

1g f and r is the scalar curvature of ads3. now multiplying

(cid:18)2  m2  2 

r

3(cid:19) f  + im2a = 0,

finally eliminating f  from eqs.(5,6) we arrive at

(cid:18)2  m2
+ 

r

3(cid:19)(cid:18)2  m2
 

r

3(cid:19) a = 0,

where

in the at space limit this is an indication that the proca-chern-simons theory de-
scribes two excitations with masses m [16]. we notice that the solutions of eq.(7)
must satisfy

or

(cid:18)2  m2
+ 
(cid:18)2  m2
 

r

3(cid:19) a = 0,
3(cid:19) a = 0.

r

therefore the general solution of eq.(7) is a superposition of solutions of the proca
theory with masses m+ and m. the proca theory has been analyzed in [5] and we
now follow closely the derivation in that paper.

we take the usual representation of the ads3 described by the half space x0 > 0,

xi  r with metric

ds2 =

1
x2
0

2

x=0

dxdx,

(11)

for which the curvature scalar is constant, r = 6. as in [5] we also introduce vector
potentials with lorentz indices a using the vielbein of ads3

the solutions which are regular at x0   can be written as

a = x0a.

a =

1

2 (cid:16) a+

 + a(cid:17) ,

where

a0 (x) = z

ai (x) = z

ki
k

x0 km+1(kx0)! ,

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

k =| ~k |, km are the modied bessel functions, and from now on m is to be under-
stood as | m |. the normalization in eq.(13) has been chosen so that it reproduces
the results in [5] in the particular case  = 0 (and hence a+ = a).

from eq.(4) we nd the following relation among the coecients a

ikiai (~k) = ma0 (~k).

(16)

in order to capture the eect of the minkowski boundary of the ads3, situated at
x0 = 0, we rst consider a dirichlet boundary value problem on the boundary surface
x0 =  > 0 and then take the limit   0. the potential at the near boundary surface
will be denoted by a,. imposing the near boundary condition on eqs.(14,15) and
using eq.(16) allow us to nd the coecients a in terms of the fourier transform of
the elds a,i

a0 (~k) =

ai (~k) =

1 a,i(~k)
km(k)

k

a,j(~k)km+1(k)

,

(17)

mk 2

m(k) + kkm (k)km1(k)

.

(18)

using this we can nally calculate the value of the classical action in the near boundary
surface using the lagrangian eq.(2). after an integration by parts and using the
equations of motion we nd that there is only a contribution from the boundary

ip cs = 

1

2 z d3x (gf a),

which evaluated on the near boundary surface gives

ip cs = 

1

2 z d2x 2 a,i(cid:16) a,i +  f,0i(cid:17) .

(19)

(20)

using eqs.(17,18,20), keeping only the relevant terms in the series expansion of the
bessel functions, and proceeding as in [5], we get

ip cs = i + + i + ...,

(21)

i =

(22)

(23)

(24)

since the metric is singular in the border the action is divergent and the limit   0
has to be taken carefully [17]. in order to have a nite action we take the limit

m(m, ||)1 a,i(~x) = a0,i(~x).

lim
0

then we use the equivalence ads/cft in the form

exp (iads)  (cid:28)exp(cid:18)z d2x ji(~x) a0,i(~x)(cid:19)(cid:29) .

when  < 0 we have m(m, |  |) 1 = m+(m, ) 1, the relevant part of i vanishes
and the only contribution to the two-point function of the conformal eld j p cs
on the
boundary cft comes from i +. when  > 0 we have m(m, |  |) 1 = m(m, ) 1,
comes from i. in both
and the only contribution to the two-point function of j p cs
cases we nd the following two-point function

i

dj p cs

(~y)e = cp cs p cs ij  2

where

and

p cs = (m, |  |),

(27)

(28)

(29)
has conformal dimension p cs. it is important to note that the identi-
so that j p cs
cation eq.(25) agrees with the requirement that the isometries of ads3 correspond to
the conformal isometries in cf t2 [17].

cp cs = c(m, |  |).

i

now we consider the particular m = 0 and  = 0 cases. in order to get the boundary
cft associated to the maxwell-chern-simons theory [13] we make m = 0 in eq.(8),
which gives

m(m, ) =

(|  |  ) .

(30)

(31)

we take

||1 a,i(~x) = a0,i(~x),

lim

and use again the ads/cft correspondence eq.(26). when  < 0 we get c+(0, ) = 0,
so that only i contributes to the two-point function on the boundary cft. when
 > 0 we have c(0, ) = 0, and all the contribution comes from i +. in both cases we
get the following two-point function

(~x) j m cs

m cs =|  | +1,

has conformal dimension m cs. as it is well known the maxwell-
so that the eld j m cs
chern-simons theory describes a particle with mass  [13] and this fact is reected in
the conformal dimension eq.(33).

i

now in order to consider the proca theory we make  = 0 on eq.(8) and get

m = m so that i + = i. taking
lim
0

m1 a,i(~x) = a0,i(~x),

and using the ads/cft correspondence eq.(26) we get

dj p

j (~y)e = 2cp p  ij  2

i has conformal dimension p . these results agree with those in

[5]. it is interesting to note that the comparison between eqs.(27) and (36) shows that
the limits   0 and   0 do not commute.

(47)

since we started with a rst order lagrangian eq.(39) when we use the eld equa-
tions the action vanishes. so as in the case of the dirac eld [5][7] and the rarita-
schwinger eld [9] we must supplement the action with a surface term which will allow
to get the correlation functions in the boundary cft. since this surface term must be
quadratic in the elds, covariant and must not vanish on-shell there is only one choice
which is given by (19) with an arbitrary coecient . so we have

isd = z d3x glsd 



2 z d2x2 a,i(cid:16) a,i +  f,0i(cid:17) .
