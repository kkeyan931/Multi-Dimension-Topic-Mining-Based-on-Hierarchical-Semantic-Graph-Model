abstract

an exact expression for the green function of a purely fermionic system

moving on the manifold   d1, where d1 is a (d  1)-torus, is found.

this expression involves the bosonic analog of n = ein corresponding to the

irreducible representation for the n-th class of homotopy and in the fermionic

case for d = 2 and 3, n is a measure of the statistics of the particles. for

higher dimensions (d  4), there is no analogue interpretation however this

could, presumably, indicate a generation of mass as in quantum eld theories

at nite temperature.

the scattering of fermions by vortices is a problem that has important applications in

particle physics [1] and in the realistic description of the aharonov-bohm eect [2]. although

this topic was partially discussed in the literature and new corrections to the ab cross

section have been found [3], as far as we know, there are no studies trying to understand

the connection between these processes and the possibility of summing over the homotopy

classes as in the bosonic case [4], [5].

if we have a multiply connected manifold with one vortex, the propagation amplitude

for a spinless particle is



g[x, x

] = xn

ngn[x, x



],

(1)

where gn[x, x] is the propagation amplitude for a given winding number n and n is an

irreducible representation for the n-th homotopy class. the composition law for the green

function implies that n = ein , where  is a quantum phase which in the case of the

aharonov-bohm eect is just the magnetic ux. equation (1) was rst conjectured by

schulman in [4] and proved rigourosly by laidlaw and c. de witt in [5].

several questions follow from this result: what is the analog of (1) for particles with

spin?, what is (if it exists) the physical meaning of the quantum phase for fermions?.

the purpose of this paper is to give an answer to the above questions and to extend and

sketch possible applications for more complicated topologies.

in order to expose our work more systematically, let us start noticing that the dirac

propagator can be written as



gd[x, x

] = (cid:28) 1
/ (cid:29),

although in this calculation one is inverting the rst order operator (i/ ), and therefore

one needs one boundary condition, the relation

gd[x, x

),

where (x, x) is the propagator for a spinless particle dened as

alert us that the boundary condition

x(1) = x
1 ,

x(2) = x
2 ,

(6)

has been used with  being the proper-time.

keeping in mind the above comments, let us start by considering the simplest fermionic

system, namely, a free massless toy fermion

living on a 0 + 1-dimensional space1. the

topology for this system is the line 1 and the boundary conditions (6) become

x(1) = x1,

x(2) = x2,

using (2) one nds that the propagator is



gd[x, x

] = lim

where in (8) an infrared regulator m has been introduced in order to make the operator

( + m)1 well dened.

the propagator (8) can be evaluated by means of the identity [6]

1although this is a non physical system, will be useful for the generalization to higher dimensions.

where the last term in the rhs in (10) have been removed because it does not contribute

in the limit m  0. using k(z)  x for x << 1, one nds after taking the limit



gd[x, x

] =

x

2|x|

=

1
2

sgn(x  x



),

(11)

and, as a consequence, the propagation amplitude becomes the sign function and the relation

gd[x, x



] = (x, x



),

(12)

is correctly satised.

the next step will be to complicate a little bit the problem considering the s1 topology

instead of 1. in this case the boundary conditions (6) must be modied as follow

x(1) = x1,

x(2) = x2 + 2n,

(13)

where n = 0, 1, 2, ..., is the winding number around the circle and in equation (11) one

should make the replacement x  x + 2n and (11) becomes

gdn[x, x



] =

1
2

sgn(x  x



+ 2n).

(14)

then, naively, (14) would be the green function for the n-th class of homotopy. the

total green function is obtained by summing over n and weighting each contribution with

a factor n, i.e. one should replace (14) by



gd[x, x

] = xn

n gdn[x, x



].

since (15) must satisfy the composition law,

g[x, x] = z dy g[x, y] g[y, x],

then (15) and (16) imply

n = ein.

(15)

(16)

(17)

the next question is to identify the interval where x is dened. one can give an answer

to this question writing rstly, the green function gd(x) as

4

gd(x) =



xn=

eingdn(x),

= gd0(x) +



xn=1

eingdn(x) +

1

xn=

eingdn(x),

(18)

where gdn(x) is dened in (14).

if x is dened over the interval 0 < x < 2, then the three terms in the rhs of (18) are

1,p

n=1 ein and p

n=1 ein respectively, and gd(x) dened in (18) does not satisfy (12).

however if x is dened over  < x < , then (12) is satised because the zero mode in

(18) is just the sign function.

thus, on this interval the function



gd[x, x

] =

1
2 xn

einsgn(x  x



+ 2n),

(19)

is the correct green function for a one-dimensional fermion moving on s1.

let us now analyse the physical meaning of . under the shift x  x + 2 the green

function (19) trasforms as



gd[x, x

+ 2] =

1
2



xn=

ein sgn[x  x



+ 2(n  1)],

and redening n  1 = m, one nds



gd[x, x

+ 2] = ei gd[x, x



].

thus, if we recall that (x) = r dxg[x, x](x), then one obtains

(x + 2) = ei(x),

(20)

(21)

(22)

implying that after one turn, the spinor changes in a phase factor and  becomes a measure

of the statistics however the question is; what statistics?.

this question can be answered as follows; one can consider the above example as de-

scribing the relative motion of two fermions with the center of mass decoupled. thus, our

eective one dimensional fermion

is described by the lagrangian

l =

i
2

  + ...,

5

(23)

where ... means terms involving the center of mass and, thus, the phase factor in (22)

becomes a measure of the interchange of two particles.

the above results can be easily generalized to d-dimensions for the n-torus. indeed let

us consider a spacetime with the topology t  d1 where t = 1 is the time and d1 is

(d  1) times s1. then the boundary conditions (6) become

x0(1) = x1
1

x0(2) = x0
2,

x1(1) = x1
1,

x1(2) = x1

2 + 2n1,

x2(1) = x2
1,

x2(2) = x2

2 + 2n2,

...

xd1(1) = xd1

1

,

xd1(2) = xd1

2 + 2nd1,

where n are the winding numbers.

using (24), the green function for the n-th class of homotopy is

gdn[ x2 , x1] = lim

the integral in (25) can be computed using (9) and in the massless limit (25) becomes

gdn[x2, x1] =

0x0 + pd1
|x0 + pd1

=1 (x  2n)
d ,
=1 (x  2n)|

containing (14) as a particular case (after removing x0 and putting  = 1).

(26)

from (26) one can conjecture the total green function

gd[x2, x1] = xn1 xn2

... xnd1

n1n2...nd1 gn1n2...nd1[x2, x1],

(27)

where n1n2...nd1 is the generalized n-th homotopy class factor.

however, by a theorem of homotopy theory [7], that essentially corresponds to the gen-

eralization of the composition law for the green function, the homotopy factors must satisfy

n1n2...nd1 = n1+n2+...+nd1,

(28)

6

and, as a consequence, each ni must be an exponential and (27) becomes

gd[x2, x1] = xn1 xn2

... xnd1

ei(n11+n22...+nd1d1) gn1n2...nd1[x2, x1],

(29)

which is the green function for a massless fermion living on the manifold 1  d1, where

d1 is the (d  1)-torus.

roughly speaking, the case d = 2 is formally equivalent to (18) because for d = 2 the

spatial manifold mspatial  s1, and (27) becomes the green function for a fermion on a

cylinder. for d = 3, mspatial  t 2 is a torus and the phase factor is also a measure of the

(fractional) statistics as was discussed by einarsson in [8]. for higher dimensions (d  4)

the phases are not related with the statistics and, presumably this could be related with

generation of mass as in quantum eld theory at nite temperature.

one could try also to include the more interesting cases such as the aharonov-bohm

eect with n aligned solenoids, however, although this problem is more complicated because

the group of paths is non abelian, one could extract some information from the problem

considered here. for a discussion about this problem in the bosonic case see [9].

in conclusion, we have generalized the propagation amplitude for the fermionic case

and extended this result to the n-torus case for arbitrary dimensions. our result could

yield interesting applications in (2 + 1)-dimensions and, particularly, a detailed study of the

fractional statistics on a torus [8] following these lines could be relevant in applications to

condensed matter physics. more details about these applications will be published elsewhere.
