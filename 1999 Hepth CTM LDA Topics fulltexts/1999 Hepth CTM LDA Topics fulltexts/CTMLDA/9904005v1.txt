abstract

we review modications of the bekenstein-hawking area law for black hole entropy in the
presence of higher-derivative interactions. in four-dimensional n = 2 compactications of string
theory or m-theory these modications are crucial for nding agreement between the macroscopic
entropy obtained from supergravity and the microscopic entropy obtained by counting states
in string or m-theory. our discussion is based on the eective wilsonian action, which in the
context of n = 2 supersymmetric theories is dened in terms of holomorphic quantities. at the
end we briey indicate how to incorporate non-holomorphic corrections.

1 introduction

it is one of the most intriguing properties of black holes in general relativity that one can derive
a set of laws, called the laws of black hole mechanics, which are formally equivalent to the laws
of thermodynamics [1]. for instance, the rst law of thermodynamics, which relates variations
of the internal energy and the work done to the variation of the entropy, has its counterpart in
black hole mechanics. the rst law for black holes in general relativity relates the variation of
the mass and angular momentum of the black hole to the change in the area of its event horizon.
this then leads to the celebrated bekenstein-hawking area law [2], which expresses the black
hole entropy in terms of the horizon area.

the rst law is quite a remarkable result as it relates global quantities of the black hole, such as its
energy or mass and its angular momentum, which can be entirely determined from the behaviour
of the elds at spatial innity, to the horizon area which is dened at the inner boundary of the
black hole solution. also, the connection with thermodynamics suggests a possible interpretation
of the entropy in terms of microstates. such an interpretation has recently been provided in the
context of string theory [3].

from the point of view of the eld theory, be it fundamental or eective, it is rather surprising
that variations near the outer boundary at spatial innity are related to variations near the
inner boundary at the horizon. moreover, an eective eld theory action will contain more
than just the standard einstein-hilbert term and will depend on higher derivatives of the elds.
so one may wonder whether there could be a natural principle that explains the behaviour
implied by the rst law of black hole mechanics for more generic eld theories. such a principle
can be provided by making use of the concept of a surface charge, and a specic proposal for
this charge was put forward by wald [4]. the surface charge is related to the conventional
noether current. in a certain sense there is no noether current associated with a local gauge
symmetry, but there exists a current associated with the residual invariance of a background
conguration. when evaluating this current subject to the eld equations, current conservation
becomes trivial and the current takes the form of an improvement term, i.e., the derivative of
an antisymmetric tensor. this antisymmetric tensor, sometimes called the noether potential,
can be written down for arbitrary gauge parameters.
integration of this potential over the
boundary of some (spatial) hypersurface leads to a surface charge, which, when restricting the
gauge transformation parameters to those that leave a certain background invariant, is equal
to the noether charge in the usual sense. variations of this surface charge that continuously
connect solutions of the equations of motion thus relate the various surface contributions and
this is how eventually the rst law of black hole mechanics follows (this is, for example, reviewed
in [5, 6, 7]).

in this approach the entropy is related to the integral of the noether potential over the horizon.
the entropy dened in this way is a local geometric quantity and equals the bekenstein-hawking
entropy (i.e., one fourth of the horizon area) for einstein gravity. but for more general actions
containing terms of higher order in derivatives the entropy formula contains additional terms.
since the low-energy eective action constitutes the macroscopic or thermodynamic level of
description of quantum gravity, the laws of black hole mechanics have to hold for such eective
actions if they are more than accidental analogies.

1

naturally, since string theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity, one expects to
be able to describe black holes also at the microscopic or statistical mechanics level. progress
into this direction has been made after nonperturbative dualities, d-branes and the m-theory
description of string theory were discovered (see, for example, [8, 9] for a review). in particular,
quantitative agreement has been found between macroscopic black hole entropies extracted
from supergravity solutions and microscopic entropies calculated by counting excitations of d-
branes and m-branes. a crucial ingredient in establishing agreement is extended supersymmetry,
because one needs to interpolate between dierent regimes of the theory, such as the low-energy
regime and the regime of small string coupling. this interpolation is possible for extremal black
holes which are bps solitons of extended supergravity.

the resulting expressions for the entropy concern extremal charged black holes and depend
exclusively on the electric and magnetic charges. these results are obtained in cases where
(some of) these charges are large, but sometimes it is also possible to evaluate some of the
subleading corrections. the comparisons between macroscopic and microscopic entropy have
mostly been made in situations where the distinction between the bekenstein-hawking area law
and more general denitions of macroscopic black hole entropy are immaterial. only recently
has it become apparent that microscopic entropy formulae contain subleading corrections which
on the macroscopic level are due to higher-derivative interactions in the eld theory [10, 11, 12].
in this case the correct macroscopic denition of entropy is crucial for nding agreement, as we
will review below.

the structure of this paper is as follows. first we will review the derivation of the noether
potential for yang-mills theories and for gravity in the context of eld theories with higher
derivatives. then we will discuss the laws of black hole mechanics and certain key notions of
black hole physics in the framework of general eective lagrangians. particular emphasis will
be put on walds derivation of the rst law and the related denition of black hole entropy as
a noether charge. then we recall the special features of extremal black holes and their relation
to supersymmetry. we briey describe how special geometry encodes the couplings of vector
multiplets to n = 2 supergravity in the presence of a certain class of higher-order derivative
terms proportional to the square of the weyl tensor. this part of the discussion is based on the
eective n = 2 wilsonian action, which is dened in terms of a holomorphic quantity. then we
review our work on the entropy of extremal n = 2 black holes in the presence of these higher-
derivative curvature terms, which uses a denition of the macroscopic entropy that deviates
from the area law. we conclude with a few examples of black hole solutions arising in string
theory compactications. by recalling results of microscopic entropy calculations in the context
of string and m-theory compactications, we show that they perfectly agree with macroscopic
entropy calculations based on walds denition of macroscopic entropy. we also briey discuss
how to incorporate non-holomorphic corrections to the eective lagrangian into macroscopic
entropy formulae.

2 noether potential and charge

for any local symmetry there exists a globally-dened noether potential, denoted here by an
antisymmetric tensor q (, ), which is a local function of the elds and of the gauge transfor-

2

mation parameters, here generically denoted by  and  respectively [4]. to derive this potential,
one starts from a gauge-invariant action and one derives the noether current as if one is dealing
with a (rigid) residual symmetry associated with a certain background eld conguration. to
illustrate this we will rst present the case of a yang-mills theory as a pedagogical example,
with a gauge-invariant lagrangian l(f ,f , ,) depending on the eld strenghts f ,
matter elds  and rst derivatives thereof. we begin by multiplying the gauge transforma-
tions with a test function (x). this test function as well as its derivatives will satisfy certain
boundary conditions, such that the variation of the action is proportional to the eld equations,
in accord with a modied (in view of the higher-derivative interactions) version of hamiltons
variational principle. hence we have

a = (x) (x) ,
 =   ,

f = 2 [] +  [, f ] ,
 =    +    .

(1)

here the gauge eld, the eld strength and the transformation parameters  are written as lie-
algebra valued quantities in the representation relevant for . the explicit variation of the action
now leads directly to the current (using that  and its rst derivative vanish at the boundary)
and one nds (we suppress the gauge-invariant inner product notation),

j  = 2l    2 l(,)   + 2l[,]    l, [f, ] + l  ,

whered

l =

l, =

.

(2)

(3)

observe that the bianchi identity implies l[,] = 0. the equations of motion for the gauge
elds take the form

 2 l + 2 l, + l,[f,]  l  = 0 .

(4)

we refrain from giving the matter eld equation for . by virtue of the combined eld equations
one can verify that this current is conserved.

however, one can also use the eld equation (4) directly on the current so as to obtain

j  =  q ,

where q is the noether potential, which in the case at hand takes the form

q = 2l   2 l,  + l,   ,

(5)

(6)

and is thus a local function of the elds and of the transformation parameter. obviously the
fact that the noether current is conserved is now trivial. nevertheless the noether potential is
still tied directly to the invariant action, up to terms that are exact, i.e., that can be written as
x , with x  a totally antisymmetric tensor, and up to improvement terms that vanish
in the symmetric background (see below). from the noether potential one can determine the
charge by integrating over a closed hypersurface of co-dimension two, in which case the ambiguity

dnote that the variations are dened such that we do not dierentiate with respect to independent eld

components. specically, the variation of the lagrangian takes the form l = l f +   .

3

drops out. for a spacelike hypersurface we then determine the noether charge in the usual sense,
but written as a surface integral. this charge is associated with the residual gauge symmetry
corresponding to parameters that satisfy   = 0 in the background. here we observe that we
have used a somewhat dierent algorithm for computing (2) than the more conventional one
used, for instance, in [4, 5, 6]. compared with the latter, this reects itself in the presence of
an additional improvement term in (2) equal to  (l, ), and hence in the presence of the
last term in (6). we thus see that both approaches yield the same noether potential up to a
term which vanishes in the symmetric background.

here we have assumed that the lagrangian is gauge invariant, which implies that the noether
current is proportional to the symmetry variations of the elds (as one can for instance verify
directly for (2)). consider now the situation where we are dealing with a continuous variety
of solutions of the eld equations which are left invariant under a corresponding continuous
variety of residual gauge transformations. the noether current associated with these residual
transformations is then vanishing for every one of these solutions, from which it follows that,
under changes of the solution (and the corresponding symmetry parameters ), the noether
potential must vary into a term that is exact, i.e.,

q =   ,

(7)

where  is a totally antisymmetric tensor. this implies that the value of the integral of the
noether potential over the boundary of a hypersurface of co-dimension one must be constant
and equal to zero for all these solutions, provided that the elds are regular on the hypersurface.
while this example is therefore not so interesting, the situation changes when the lagrangian
is only invariant modulo a total derivative, because then the current does in general not vanish
in symmetric background solutions. for yang-mills theory this happens, for example, when the
lagrangian contains chern-simons terms.

for the case of gravity with general coordinate invariance, the lagrangian is never invariant
under general coordinate transformations, so here the current will not necessarily vanish in
a symmetric background. so let us follow the same procedure for gravity and construct the
noether potential, starting from an invariant action depending on the riemann curvature, and
on a matter eld  (with no particular symmetry) and its rst derivative. after multiply-
ing the dieomorphisms with a test function (x) with appropriate boundary conditions, the
transformation rules read

g = (x)(cid:16) (x) +  (x)(cid:17) ,
 = (x)(cid:16)   +    +  (cid:17) .

we note the following useful equations for variations of connections and curvatures,



 = 1

r = r[

2 gh g +  g   gi ,

 g] + 2[[ g]] .

the variation of the action, assuming the boundary conditions for , now yields the current

3 black hole entropy

as was shown by wald one can employ the noether charge in order to nd generalized denitions
of the black hole entropy that are consistent with the rst law of black hole mechanics. although
most of the following applies to black holes in any number of spacetime dimensions we will restrict
ourselves to four dimensions. as we discussed already in the introduction, the description in
terms of a surface charge can in principle explain how variations of the elds subject to the
equations of motion at the horizon can be expressed in terms of the variations of quantities that
are dened at spatial innity. the crucial observation [4] is that there exists a hamiltonian,
whose change under a variation of the elds can be expressed in terms of the corresponding
change of the noether charge and takes the following form

h = (cid:16)zc

d j (cid:17) zc

d  (    ) ,

(20)

where we integrate over a cauchy surface c with volume element d, j  is the noether current
associated with a particular killing vector  (to be discussed below) and  is dened by the
surface integral that one obtains when considering the change of the action under the eld
variation,

after subsequently imposing the eld equations. we assume that the killing vector eld is
timelike so that h can be associated with a hamiltonian that governs the evolution along the
integral timelike lines of .

for black holes,  is a horizon-generating killing eld, meaning that it is the normal vector
of a null hypersurface, called the killing horizon. the cauchy surface in (20) is chosen to
extend from spatial innity down to the killing horizon where the killing eld turns lightlike.
in einstein gravity it can be shown that under certain assumptions, such as that the dominant-
energy condition holds and that the matter eld equations of motion have a well dened cauchy
problem, all event horizons are killing horizons [13], but in more general theories this is not
obvious. for static black holes, the event horizon is always a killing horizon [14], irrespective
of the precise form of the action. in that case the relevant killing eld is just the static killing
vector eld. in the following we shall always assume that we are dealing with a killing horizon.

when imposing the equations of motion, (20) takes the form of surface integrals over the bound-
ary c with surface element d,

h = zc

d(cid:16)q    +  (cid:17) .

(22)

here it is important that the last two terms are proportional to the killing vector and not to
its curl. furthermore one assumes that these terms can be rewritten as variations of some (not
necessarily globally dened) quantity. because one can prove that h = 0 (but not that h itself
vanishes) whenever  is a killing vector characterizing an invariance of the full background,
it follows that the sum of the surface integrals in (22) has to vanish! if one identies, up to a
certain proportionality factor, the resulting variations of the surface integrals at innity with the
mass and angular momentum variations that one has in the rst law, then the surface integral

6

at the horizon denes the variation of the entropy. hence the mass, the angular momentum and
the entropy are all surface charges derived from the same current, and the entropy takes the
form of an integral over the noether potential [4],

s =  zhor q  (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0, [ ]=

.

(23)

here hor denotes a spacelike cross section of the killing horizon (which usually has the topology
of s2) and we have used d =  h d2x. here  denotes the binormal, whose denition
we will review below and which is normalized according to  = 2; h d2x gives the
surface element induced on hor. we already mentioned that the noether potential q can be
decomposed according to q = y [ ] + n  . we shall discuss in due course how
one is led to impose the conditions  = 0 and [ ] =  on the killing vector eld at hor
associated with the noether potential in (23). let us already point out that the contributions
we are suppressing in (23) by imposing these conditions have actually been shown to vanish
for non-extremal black holes [5]; this is more subtle for extremal black holes, where the surface
gravity is vanishing. nevertheless we simply adopt (23) as the denition for the entropy in
both the extremal and non-extremal case. note that in both cases (23) leads in principle to a
well-dened result.

finally, the normalization in (23) has been chosen such that we reproduce the bekenstein-
hawking area law for static black holes in general relativity. to see this, we note that the
lagrangian associated to einstein gravity, with the conventions of [12], reads 8l =  1
2 r, so
that 8 l =  1
2 g[ g] . consequently we have, subject to the conditions in (23), that
q = 2l  which equals (8)1  for einstein gravity. substitution of this result into
(23) immediately yields one-fourth of the area, expressed in planck units.

in the presence of higher-derivative curvature terms, the entropy of a static black hole solution
will in general not any longer be simply given by the bekenstein-hawking area law. as shown
in the previous section (c.f. (17)), when the lagrangian depends on the riemann curvature
tensor but not on derivatives thereof, as well as on matter elds with at most second derivatives,
then q = 2l  when we impose the conditions on the killing vector at the horizon,
specied in (23). the entropy of the static black hole is then given by [15, 5, 6]

s = 2zhor l   .

(24)

this is the result that we will need in the next section.

we will now review some of the concepts involved in the denition (23) of the black hole en-
tropy [4, 5, 6, 16] in somewhat more detail. walds construction of the entropy as a surface
charge applies to stationary and to some extent also to non-stationary black holes in arbitrary
spacetime dimensions, but in the following we will for concreteness restrict the discussion to
four-dimensional static black hole solutions. a spacetime containing a black hole consists of an
asymptotically at region, which is separated by a (future) event horizon from an interior re-
gion, such that after crossing the horizon one is trapped in the interior region. usually, the term
horizon designates either the horizon at a given instant of time, i.e. a spacelike two-surface
hor, or the corresponding worldvolume  swept out in time by hor, which is a hypersurface in
spacetime. in order to avoid any confusion, we will consistently distinguish between these two
cases and use the symbols hor and  throughout.

7

a hypersurface can be dened by an equation f (x) = 0. since the gradient f is automatically
normal to the surface (i.e. t f = 0 for all tangent vectors t) one can equally well specify this
surface in terms of the normal vector eld n = f . according to the frobenius theorem, which
formulates necessary and sucient conditions for vector elds to dene smoothly embedded
submanifolds, a vector eld n is hypersurface orthogonal in the above sense if and only if

n[n] = 0 .

(25)

if the normal vector eld of a hypersurface is a null vector eld, nn = 0, then the hypersurface
is called a null hypersurface. note that the normal vector eld of a null hypersurface is also
tangential to it. the (future) event horizon  is such a null hypersurface. since we assumed
that it is a killing horizon we know that its normal vector is in fact a killing vector eld.

by taking a spacelike cross section of  one obtains a spacelike surface hor.
in the two-
dimensional space normal to hor there exists one linearly independent antisymmetric tensor of
second rank,  , which is called the normal bivector or simply the binormal. we will normalize
it according to   = 2. the binormal can be explicitly written as a bivector, as follows.
first we note that the space normal to hor has signature (+), and therefore it can be spanned
by two null vectors. since hor is contained in , one of the null vectors can be taken to be the
normal n of , that is, one of the null vectors is proportional to the killing vector . the
other null vector, which we denote by n , is chosen such that n n = 1. then, the bivector
(26)

 = nn  nn

is non-vanishing in the normal directions and has the required normalization.

the spacetime metric describing a static and spherically symmetric black hole solution can be
written as

ds2 = e2g(r)dt2 + e2f (r)(dr2 + r2d2)

(27)

in isotropic coordinates (t, r, , ). in such an adapted coordinate system, the time coordinate t
and the radius r denote the directions normal to the two-sphere hor, whose coordinates are 
and . thus, the associated binormal  has the non-vanishing components (up to an overall
sign) tr = rt = exp[g(r) + f (r)].
in order to formulate the laws of black hole mechanics, we need to dene the notion of surface
gravity s associated with a killing horizon. since the killing vector eld is null on the horizon
(but in general  6= 0), we can take f =  = 0 as the dening equation of the horizon .
since f is normal to , it must be proportional to  itself. the coecient of proportionality
denes the surface gravity s of the black hole:

observe that this presupposes a certain intrinsic normalization for the killing vector eld, which
is usually specied at spatial innity. subsequently one shows that

 ( ) = 2s  .

(28)

s =  1

2 ()() = 1

2 r 

and

 s = 0 .

(29)

the rst equation follows by multiplying (28) with  and by making use of the killing
equation (18) together with the frobenius theorem (25) with n = . on the other hand, it

8

follows from (19) that     = 0, so that s is constant along the integral curves of 
on . this is the last equation. the second equality is then obtained by applying a covariant
derivative  on (28) and by using (19). for a static and spherically symmetric black hole, the
surface gravity s is thus constant over all of . the constancy of s over  is known as the
zero-th law of black hole mechanics. we should point out here that the above considerations do
not quite apply to extremal black holes, because they have zero surface gravity. we return to
this point shortly.

the comparison with the laws of thermodynamics suggests to identify the surface gravity with
the temperature of the black hole, up to a multiplicative constant. then, the zero-th law is
reinterpreted by stating that the killing horizon is in thermodynamical equilibrium and that
it radiates like a black body. this interpretation is conrmed by the phenomenon of hawking
radiation which is found when quantizing matter elds in a classical black hole background [2].
in this way the proportionality constant is xed according to t = s/2, where t denotes the
hawking temperature.

it is instructive to calculate the surface gravity for a reissner-nordstrm black hole in general
relativity, which provides an example of a static and charged black hole. in a coordinate sys-
tem where the curvature singularity is located at r = 0, the associated spherically symmetric
spacetime line element is given by

ds2 = e2h(r)dt2 + e2h(r)dr2 + r2d2 , e2h(r) = 1

(30)

where m and q denote the mass and the charge of the black hole, respectively. the cases
q = 0, m > |q| and m = |q| yield the schwarzschild, the non-extremal and the extremal
reissner-nordstrm black hole, respectively. the case m < |q| is excluded by the generalized
positivity theorem for the adm mass when assuming the so-called dominant-energy condition,
i.e., a non-negative energy density and a non-spacelike energy ow for every observer [17]. the
surface gravity is computed to be [16]

s =

(31)

pm 2  q2

2m (m +pm 2  q2)  q2

which shows that charged and neutral black holes behave very dierently when loosing energy by
hawking radiation. the schwarzschild black hole (q = 0) will heat up in the process, because
s = (4m )1, which suggests that it will completely evaporate into radiation. on the other
hand a charged black hole will cool down when approaching the extremal limit, namely s  0
for m  q. the nal state, an extremal black hole with s = 0, has vanishing hawking
temperature and could therefore be a stable object. in the following, we will always call black
hole solutions extremal if they have s = 0. note that this does not necessarily imply that they
are extremal in the sense of being on the edge of developing a naked singularity.

we now turn to the rst law of black hole mechanics which relates changes of the black hole
mass to changes in the entropy as well as to changes of other quantities which characterize the
black hole, such as its charges. in the following we will omit these latter changes for the sake of
clarity. for a static black hole, the rst law follows from (22) with h = 0 by taking the cauchy
surface c to have a boundary hor  , where hor denotes a spacelike cross section of the
event horizon, and where  denotes a two-sphere at spatial innity. inspection of (22) and

9

(23) (where in (23) we have adopted a dierent normalization for the killing vector, see below)
then suggests to identify the change in the mass and in the entropy of the black hole with

(32)

in accordance with the rst law of thermodynamics, e = t s + , with e = m and t =
s/2. we note that the rst law applies to non-extremal black holes, which have a non-
vanishing surface gravity. we now proceed to express the entropy as a surface integral of a local
geometrical quantity.
as already mentioned, the noether potential has the generic form q = y [ ] + n ,
where the tensors n  and y  are local quantities constructed out of the riemann tensor
and its derivatives. the antisymmetric tensor   can be decomposed as follows,

  = s  + t[ ] ,

(33)

where t is tangential to . this decomposition expresses the fact that according to the
frobenius theorem the non-vanishing components of  are those where at least one of
the indices is not tangential to . the coecient of  is determined by contracting (33)
with  and by comparing with (29), where one also uses the explicit realization (26)
of  as a bivector. by substituting the decomposition (33) into q we obtain q =
s y   + [n  + y  t[ 
] ] . observe that the last two terms of the integrand
in (32) are proportional to the killing vector and can thus be absorbed into n , so they dont
need to be discussed separately.

for non-extremal black holes there is a theorem [18] which states that the horizon hypersurface
 contains, or can be analytically extended to contain, a spacelike cross section, called the
bifurcation surface 0, where the timelike killing vector eld has a zero,  = 0, so that
 = s . in theories with matter one also has to assume that the matter elds can likewise
be analytically continued and that all the elds are regular at the bifurcation surface. thus, by
evaluating the noether potential on 0 one can get rid of the terms in q proportional to the
killing vector eld, so that we are left with s/2 times the variation of the entropy dened
in (23) but with hor replaced by 0. as already mentioned, it can be shown [5] that, when
replacing 0 with any other spacelike cross section hor of the horizon, the resulting expression
for the entropy is given by a similar expression, namely by (23), which indeed expresses the
entropy as a surface integral of a local geometrical quantity over an arbitrary cross section of
the horizon.

as stressed above, the above procedure for deriving the rst law of black hole mechanics applies
to non-extremal black holes. nevertheless, the resulting expression for the entropy (23) remains
well behaved in the extremal limit s  0, as it is independent of s and of the killing eld
. since extremal black holes do not possess a bifurcation surface, it is important that the
entropy can be evaluated on any spacelike cross section hor, as is the case with (23). thus, we
expect that the entropy of an extremal black hole, if computed from (23), will be non-vanishing
in general. it should be pointed out though that the question whether or not an extremal black
hole has a non-vanishing entropy, is a somewhat subtle issue that depends on the approach used

10

to compute its entropy. for instance, in the context of semiclassical quantization of matter
coupled to einstein gravity, one nds that the entropy of an extremal reissner-nordstrm black
hole is non-vanishing and given by the bekenstein-hawking area law, provided the extremal
limit is taken after quantization.
if, on the other hand, the quantization is performed after
extremalization (that is, if the quantization is applied to the part of phase space that only
contains extremal congurations), then the resulting entropy is vanishing. this has been shown
both in the euclidean path integral framework [19] and in the minkowskian canonical framework
[20]. in the context of string theory, various microscopic state countings yield a non-vanishing
entropy in all cases where extremal black holes have a non-vanishing horizon area. thus, string
theory favours to treat extremal black holes as limiting cases of non-extremal ones.

a comparison of walds noether charge approach with various other approaches can be, for
instance, found in [15, 21] and references therein. within their domain of applicability, all of
these other approaches yield results in agreement with the noether charge approach.

4 supersymmetric black holes

the electrically charged static extremal reissner-nordstrm solution of einstein-maxwell the-
ory, which we briey described in (30), enjoys several remarkable properties, as follows.
it
interpolates between two maximally symmetric spaces, namely minkowski at spacetime at spa-
tial innity and bertotti-robinson spacetime at the horizon. there exists a dyonic version of
it, whose mass m and entropy s (the latter computed from the area law) are determined in
terms of its electric and magnetic charges q and p as m = |q + ip| and s = |q + ip|2. since
its temperature vanishes, this suggests that such a dyonic black hole is quantum mechanically
stable. moreover, its mass saturates the bogomolnyi bound which follows from the generalized
positivity theorem for the adm mass [17]. there also exists a static multi-center version of
it, which is described by the majumdar-papapetrou metric [22] and which resembles the static
multi-monopole solutions of yang-mills-higgs theories in the prasad-sommereld limit.

all these properties can be explained in terms of a symmetry principle, namely supersymme-
try, by embedding einstein-maxwell theory into n = 2 supergravity [17]. then the extremal
reissner-nordstrm black hole solution can be interpreted as a supersymmetric soliton which
interpolates between two maximally supersymmetric vacua of n = 2 supergravity. globally the
solution is invariant under 4 of the 8 supersymmetries. its mass formula follows from the n = 2
supersymmetry algebra and takes the form m = |z|, where z denotes the central charge of the
supersymmetry algebra. it is determined in terms of the electric and magnetic charges q and p
associated with the gauge eld, namely by z = q + ip.

more recently, following the work of [23], this has been extended to the study of static super-
symmetric black hole solutions in four-dimensional theories describing the coupling of n abelian
vector multiplets to n = 2 supergravity in the presence of a certain class of r2-terms [24, 12].
such theories arise as low-energy eective eld theories of string and m-theory compactications
on suitable compact manifolds. these eective lagrangians contain, in general, various other
terms describing the couplings of additional sectors, such as matter associated with hypermul-
tiplets, to supergravity. these other sectors, however, play only a limited role in the following
and we will therefore omit them.

11

let us rst review how the couplings of vector multiplets to n = 2 supergravity can be described
in terms of special geometry. since we will allow for the presence of certain r2-terms, we
will utilize the so-called superconformal framework, which provides a systematic and powerful
approach for constructing these couplings [25]. it makes use of the fact that a conformal theory
of n = 2 supergravity with suitable couplings to compensating multiplets is gauge equivalent
to n = 2 poincare supergravity. in the superconformal framework, there is a multiplet, the so-
called weyl multiplet, which comprises the gravitational degrees of freedom, namely the graviton,
two gravitini as well as various other superconformal gauge elds and also some auxiliary elds.
one of these auxiliary elds is an anti-selfdual lorentz tensor eld t ab ij, where i, j = 1, 2
denote chiral su (2) indices (we recall that the associated su (2) algebra is part of the n = 2
superconformal algebra). the eld strengths corresponding to the various gauge elds in the
weyl multiplet reside in a so-called reduced chiral multiplet, denoted by w ab ij, from which one
then constructs the unreduced chiral multiplet w 2 = (w ab ijij)2 [26]. the lowest component
eld of w 2 is a = (t ab ijij)2.

in addition, there are n + 1 abelian vector multiplets labelled by an index i = 0, . . . , n. each
vector multiplet contains a complex scalar eld x i , a vector gauge eld w i
 with eld strength
f i
 , as well as two gaugini and a set of auxiliary scalar elds. the couplings of these n + 1
vector multiplets to the weyl multiplet are encoded in a holomorphic function f (x i , a), which is
homogenous of degree two and consequently satises x i fi + 2 af a = 2f , where fi = f/x i ,
f a = f/ a.
the eld equations of the vector multiplets are subject to equivalence transformations corre-
sponding to electric-magnetic duality, which do not involve the elds of the weyl multiplet.
these equivalence transformations are symplectic sp(2n + 2; z) transformations. two complex
(2n + 2)-component vectors can now be dened which transform linearly under sp(2n + 2; z)
transformations, namely

v =  

x i

and

where (f i

is dened by the variation of the action with respect to f i
 . the precise denition reads
g
i = 4i (g)1/2 s/f i
 . by integrating the gauge elds over two-dimensional surfaces
enclosing their sources, it is possible to associate to (f i
i ) a symplectic vector (pi , qi )
comprising the magnetic and electric charges. it is then possible to construct a complex quantity
z out of the charges and out of v which is invariant under symplectic transformations, as follows,

 , g

z = ek/2 (pi fi (x, a)  qi x i ) ,

(35)

where ek = i[ x i fi (x, a)  fi ( x,
the associated (wilsonian) lagrangian describing the coupling of these vector multiplets to
supergravity is quite complicated [27]. here we only display those terms which will be relevant
for the computation of the entropy of a static supersymmetric black hole,

part of the weyl tensor c, and f
to unity in order to obtain a properly normalized einstein-hilbert term. in this way we x the
local scale invariance which is present in a superconformal formulation of the theory. we note
that the lagrangian contains c 2
-terms, but no terms involving derivatives of the riemann
curvature tensor. by expanding the holomorphic function f (x, a) in powers of a, f (x, a) =
g=0 f (g)(x) ag, we see that the lagrangian (36) contains an innite set of higher-derivative
(t ab ijij)2g2 (g  1) with eld-dependent coupling functions

curvature terms of the type c 2
f (g)(x).

as alluded to above, we will view a static supersymmetric black hole solution of the lagrangian
(36) as a solitonic interpolation between two n = 2 supersymmetric groundstates, namely at
spacetime at spatial innity and the horizon, whose geometry we now proceed to determine.
the spacetime line element associated with a static spherically symmetric solution is of the
form (27) in isotropic coordinates. the near-horizon solution can be specied by imposing full
n = 2 supersymmetry on the solution. this is achieved by requiring that the supersymmetry
variations of all the fermions present in the theory vanish in the bosonic black hole background.
we stress here that we do not analyze the equations of motion, as their validity is implied by
full n = 2 supersymmetry. a careful analysis [12] of the resulting restrictions on the bosonic
background then shows that the x i and a are constant at the horizon. since the black hole
is charged and can carry both magnetic and electric charges (pi , qi ), the associated quantity z
(35) is therefore generically non-vanishing and constant at the horizon. moreover, we also nd
that t 01 ij = i t 23 ij = 2ij ek/2 z 1, while all other components of t ab ij vanish. therefore
we have a = 64 ek z 2. and nally, the near-horizon spacetime geometry is determined to
be of the bertotti-robinson type, that is of the form (27) with e2g(r) = e2f (r) = ek |z|2 r2.
the requirement of n = 2 supersymmetry at the horizon does not by itself x the actual values
of the constants x i . to do so, we have to invoke the so-called xed-point behaviour [23] for the
scalar elds x i at the horizon (for a recent reference on the xed-point behaviour, see [28]). the
xed-point behaviour implies that regardless of what the values of the scalar elds are at spatial
innity, they always take the same values at the horizon. in the absence of higher-derivative
terms it has been shown [23] that the supersymmetric black hole solutions do indeed always
exhibit xed-point behaviour as a result of their residual n = 1 supersymmetry. in the presence
of higher-derivative terms this has not yet been shown to be the case. in the following we will
assume that such a xed-point behaviour holds for black hole solutions of the lagrangian (36).
from electric-magnetic duality one may then deduce that the values of the scalar elds x i at
the horizon are determined from a set of equations, called the stabilization equations, which
take the following form [24, 12]

z 

x i

fi (x, a) !  z 

x i
fi ( x,

a) ! = iek/2  pi

qi ! .

(37)

at this point it is convenient to introduce rescaled variables y i = ek/2 zx i and  = ek z 2 a =
64. using the homogeneity property of f mentioned earlier, it follows that the stabilization
equations (37) now simply read y i  y i = ipi and fi (y, )  fi ( y , ) = iqi . these equations
then determine the value of the rescaled elds y i in terms of the charges carried by the black
hole. on the other hand, it follows from (35) that |z|2 = pi fi (y, )  qiy i , which determines

13

the value of |z| in terms of (pi , qi ).
the entropy of the static black hole solution described above can now be computed from (24),
using (36). the result takes the remarkably concise form [12]

s = h|z|2  256 im f ai .

(38)

the rst term denotes the bekenstein-hawking entropy contribution, whereas the second term
is due to walds modication of the denition of the entropy in the presence of higher-derivative
terms. here we point out that this contribution does not actually originate from the c 2
-
terms in the action, because the weyl tensor vanishes at the horizon, but from the term in c
(see below (36)) proportional to the product of the ricci tensor with the tensor eld t ab ijtcd kl!
note that when switching on higher-derivative interactions the value of |z| changes and hence
also the horizon area changes. there are thus two ways in which the presence of higher-derivative
interactions modies the black hole entropy, namely by a change of the near-horizon geometry
and by an explicit deviation from the bekenstein-hawking area law. also note that the entropy
(38) is entirely determined in terms of the charges carried by the black hole, s = s(q, p).
let us now exhibit the generic dependence of the macroscopic entropy (38) on the charges. let
q denote a generic electric or magnetic charge carried by the black hole. for large charges
q, the stabilization equations (37) and the homogeneity property of f imply that the generic
dependence of the entropy (38) on the charges is given by

s = 



xg=0

ag q22g

(39)

with constant coecients ag. we recall that (39) encodes the contributions from a particular set
of r2-terms, namely terms proportional to c 2
. in general, however, the eective lagrangian
will not only contain these particular terms, but also many other (even higher-derivative) cur-
vature terms which, in principle, will lead to further contributions to the entropy. one might
then worry that the inclusion of such contributions could wash out the contributions appearing
in (39). in the context of string theory this appears to be unlikely, given that the coecients
multiplying the various powers of the charges in (39) encode topological information about the
n = 2 compactication.

5 examples

let us now briey discuss various classes of black hole solutions arising in string theory compact-
ications. we will use the rescaled variables y i = ek/2 zx i ,  = ek z 2 a = 64 throughout.
let us rst consider type-iia string theory compactied on a calabi-yau threefold, in the limit
where the volume of the calabi-yau threefold is taken to be large. for the associated homogenous
function f (y, ) we take (with i = 0, . . . , n and a = 1, . . . , n)

f (y, ) =

dabc y ay by c

y 0

+ da

y a
y 0  , dabc =  1

6 cabc , da =  1

24

64 c2a ,

(40)

14

where the coecients cabc denote the intersection numbers of the four-cycles of the calabi-
yau threefold, whereas the coecients c2a denote its second chern-class numbers [29]. the
lagrangian (36) associated with this homogenous function thus contains a term proportional to
, where za = y a/y 0. the associated stabilization equations can be solved [12]
c2a im za c 2
for black holes with p0 = 0, yielding y i = y i (q, p). the result for the macroscopic entropy,
which is computed from (38), reads [12]

s = 2q 1

6 |q0|(cabc papbpc + c2a pa) ,
12 dabqaqb , dab = dabc pc , dabdbc = c

where q0 = q0 + 1
a . the expression (41) for the
macroscopic entropy is in exact agreement with the microscopic entropy formula computed in
[10, 11] via state counting.

(41)

next, let us consider black hole solutions arising in heterotic string compactications on k3t2.
the associated tree-level function is given by

f (y, ) = 

y 1y aaby b

y 0

+ c

y 1
y 0  , a = 2, . . . , n ,

(42)

where the real constants ab and c are related to the intersection numbers of two-cycles and to
the second chern-class number of k3, respectively. for a function f (y, ) of the form (42),
the stabilization equations can be solved in full generality and the resulting expression for the
entropy reads [30]

s =  qhm, mihn, ni  (m  n )2 s1 

512 c
hn, ni

,

(43)

where the mi = (q0,p1, q2, q3, . . . , qn) and the n i = (p0, q1, p2, p3, . . . , pn) now denote the
electric and magnetic charges carried by the heterotic black hole. the bilinears hm, mi and
hn, ni are given by

hm, mi = 2(cid:16)m0m1 + 1

4 maabmb(cid:17) ,

hn, ni = 2(cid:16)n 0n 1 + n aabn b(cid:17) ,

(44)

whereas mn = mi n i . these bilinears are invariant under tree-level target-space duality trans-
formations of the charges [31]. we thus see that turning on a term proportional to im z1 c 2
(z1 = y 1/y 0) in the lagrangian leads again to a modication of the entropy.



ag1(g 
there will be various corrections to (41) and to (43) from terms proportional to c 2
2) in the eective lagrangian (36). these corrections are such that they no longer preserve the
square-root feature of the entropy formulae (41) and (43) [30].



the examples of black hole solutions discussed so far occur in n = 2 compactications of string
theory. let us now consider black hole solutions occuring in heterotic n = 4 compactications.
at tree-level there is a term proportional to re s c 2
 in the eective lagrangian of heterotic
string theory compactied on a six-torus, where s here denotes the heterotic dilaton eld. the
entropy of a black hole solution in the presence of such an c 2
-term is given by an expression
analogous to (43). as can be seen from (43), the analogous expression is not invariant under
the exchange of the electric and the magnetic charges. the heterotic n = 4 theory is, however,

15

expected to be invariant under strong-weak coupling duality. here we recall that it is essen-
tial to distinguish between the wilsonian couplings of an eective theory and the physical (in
general momentum-dependent) eective couplings. in theories with massless elds, the eective
couplings are dierent from the wilsonian couplings and do not share their analytic properties.
in the context of heterotic n = 4 compactications, the eective coupling function multiply-
ing c 2
 is non-holomorphic and invariant under strong-weak coupling duality transformations
[32], whereas the wilsonian coupling function, which at tree-level is proportional to s, is holo-
morphic although not invariant under strong-weak coupling duality. thus, in order to arrive
at a manifestly strong-weak coupling duality invariant expression for the entropy of a heterotic
n = 4 black hole, its computation should be based on the eective rather than the wilsonian
coupling function of c 2

.

we will now restrict ourselves to black hole solutions in an n = 2 subsector of the heterotic
n = 4 theory. both the stabilization equations (37) and the entropy formula (38) were derived
in the wilsonian context and as such they are dened in terms of a holomorphic function f .
in the eective coupling approach, on the other hand, we expect that both (37) and (38) will
receive non-holomorphic corrections so as to be consistent with strong-weak coupling duality.
the function f , in particular, will not any longer be holomorphic:

f (y, y , ) = 

y 1y aaby b

y 0

+ f (1)(z1, z1)  ,

(45)

where we require that (45) turns into the tree-level function (42) at weak coupling, that is
f (1)(z1, z1)  c z1 as s + s  , where s = iz1 = i y 1/y 0. the associated stabilization
equations now read

y i  y i = ipi

, fi (y, y , )  fi (y, y , ) = iqi

,  = 64 .

the form of f (1)(z1, z1) can then be determined by requiring (46) to transform in a consistent
way under strong-weak coupling duality transformations and also by requiring f (1)(z1, z1) to
have the weak-coupling behaviour specied above [30]:

f (1)(s, s) = 6 i

c

 (cid:16) log 2(s) + log(s + s)(cid:17) ,

where (s) denotes the dedekind function. the associated non-holomorphic quantity |z|2 =
pi fi (y, y , )  qi y i is then invariant under strong-weak coupling duality. in analogy to (38)
we thus propose the following strong-weak coupling duality invariant expression for the entropy
of a black hole in an n = 2 subsector of the heterotic n = 4 theory [30]:

(46)

(47)

(48)

s = h |z|2  256 im(cid:16) f (1)(s, s) + 3 i

log(s + s)(cid:17) i .

c


the additional non-holomorphic piece in (48) is there to render the expression invariant under
strong-weak coupling duality. we note that the value of the dilaton s at the horizon is, in
principle, determined in terms of the charges mi and n i carried by the black hole through the
stabilization equations (46), although in practice they are hard to solve. we refer to [30] for a
more detailed discussion of these and related issues.
