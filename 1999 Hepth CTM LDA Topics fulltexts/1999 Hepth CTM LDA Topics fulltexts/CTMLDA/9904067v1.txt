the algebraic consistency of spin and isospin at the level of an unbroken su (2) gauge theory suggests the existence of
an additional angular momentum besides the spin and isospin and also produces a full quaternionic spinor operator. the
latter corresponds to a vector boson in space-time, interpreted as a su (2) gauge eld. the existence of quaternionic spinor
elds implies in a quaternionic hilbert space and its necessary mathematical analysis. it is shown how to obtain a unique
representation of a quaternion function by a convergent positive power series.

i. quaternion quantum mechanics

after six decades, quaternion quantum mechanics is
coming out of age. the earliest known reference on a
possible generalization of quantum theory with respect to
the background eld dates back to 1934 with the paper
by jordan et all [1]. the use of quaternions properly
was proposed by birko and von neumann in 1936, later
developed by finkelstein [2], and more recently by adler
and others [3].

the original motivation for quaternion quantum me-
chanics was formal: the propositional calculus implies
that it is possible to represent the pure states of a quan-
tum system by rays on a hilbert dened on any asso-
ciative division algebra. this includes the quaternion
algebra as the most general case. contrasting with this,
the next division (but non associative) algebra, the oc-
tonion algebra, has been always associated with physical
arguments, notably in connection with the su (3) gauge
symmetry and strong interactions [4,5,6,7].

in its essence, quaternion quantum mechanics is a
modication of the complex quantum theory, in which
the wave functions belong to a hilbert space dened over
the quaternion eld. as a physical theory, it should prove
to be eective at some high energy level, exhibiting ex-
perimental evidence which would distinguish it from the
complex theory [8].

as in all cliord algebras, it is possible to represent
the quaternion algebra as a tensor product of two in-
dependent complex algebras. therefore, in principle we
could write quaternion functions with complex compo-
nents and use two independent expressions of complex
analyticity. however this does not mean that complex
concept of analyticity extends trivially to quaternions.

this paper has two purposes. one of them is to show
by a simple argument that the combined spin and isospin
states leads to quaternion quantum mechanics, and vice

versa, that the algebraic consistency of quaternion quan-
tum mechanics necessarily implies in the existence of
an intrinsic angular momentum representing the com-
bined spin and isospin at the level of an unbroken su (2)
gauge theory. the second and more formal topic is a
consequence of the rst: the emergence of a quater-
nionic hilbert space requires the solution of dierential
equations involving functions of a quaternionic variable,
quaternionic fourier expansions and quaternionic phase
transformations. we will see that the traditional com-
plex notion of analyticity characterized by direction in-
dependent derivatives does not necessarily apply, so that
quaternionic quantum states may exhibit dierent behav-
ior along dierent directions in space.

ii. isospin and quaternions

the standard textbook explanation on why quantum
mechanics should be dened over the complex eld is
based on the double slit experiment, together with the
complex phase dierence for the wave functions. how-
ever, this can also be explained by a real quantum the-
ory provided a special operator such that j 2 = 1 and
j t = j is introduced [2]. although most people would
agree that this is equivalent to quantum mechanics over
the complex eld, a more denitive argument for the
complex algebra comes from the spin. the existence and
classication of the spinor representations of the rota-
tion subgroup of the lorentz group demands a solution
of quadratic algebraic equations for the eigenvalues of the
invariant operators. this can be guaranteed only within
the complex eld. the bottom line is, complex quantum
mechanics is a requirement of the spin and its spinor
structure [9].

following a similar argument we may convince our-
selves that quaternion quantum mechanics is an algebraic
requirement of the spin together with the isospin and the
associated spinor structures.
in fact, while the spin is
associated with the spinor representations of the so(3)
subgroup of the lorentz group, the isospin is given by a

1

representation of the gauge group su (2). actually the
two groups are isomorphic and they have equivalent rep-
resentations given by the pauli matrices (they are iden-
tical representations, distinguished only by dierent no-
tations), acting on independent spinor spaces.

in the case of the unbroken su (2) gauge theory, spin
and isospin are present in a combined symmetry scheme,
so that the total spinor space is a direct sum of the spinor
space and the isospinor spaces: k = i  j. the spinor
space is represented as a complex plane (a gauss plane)
generated by the basis

in conclusion, quaternion quantum mechanics appears
as consistent condition of the combined spin and isospin
symmetries. a possible relation between quaternions and
the isotopic spin was suggested by c. n. yang [2] and
by e. j. schremp [15]. however, their basic arguments
are distinct from the ones based on the combination of
symmetries.

when the two spinor spaces are taken together, they
give way to a quaternionic spin operator given by a 2  2
matrix representation of the quaternion algebra given by
the pauli matrices

i= (spinor space) :(cid:26)1 =(cid:18) 1

0 (cid:19) , i =(cid:18) 0

1(cid:19)(cid:27)

and the isospinor space represented by another complex
plane generated by

j=(isopinor space) :(cid:26)1 =(cid:18) 1

0(cid:19) , j =(cid:18) 0

1(cid:19)(cid:27)

thus, i and j can be taken as two independent gauss
planes sharing the same real unit 1, but with dierent and
independent imaginary units i and j respectively. as long
as the isospin symmetry and the spinor representation of
the lorentz group remain combined, the corresponding
angular momenta add up to generate a total angular mo-
mentum represented in the direct sum of the two spinor
spaces. on the other hand, it has been argued that when
this combined symmetry is broken the su (2) degree of
freedom reappears as a spin degree of freedom [10]. fol-
lowing these ideas a fermionic state is derived from a
magnetic monopole model in four dimensions associated
with an su (2) soliton [11,12,13,14].

the question we address here concerns with the alge-
braic consistency of the combined spinor-isospinor sym-
metry as it remains unbroken. in this case, we end up
with the total spinor space generated by the hypercom-
plex basis {1, i, j}. according to hamilton this direct
sum is algebraically consistent only if a third imaginary
unit k such that k = ij is introduced. that is, we can
only close the algebra if a third complex plane

k=( new spinor space) :(cid:26)1 =(cid:18) 1

0(cid:19) , k =(cid:18) 0

1(cid:19)(cid:27)

is introduced. we conclude that an additional spin-half
eld should also be present. this new spinor may be
the generator of the jackiw-rebbi spin degree of free-
dom after the symmetry is broken. however, this is not
all. when the combined symmetry remains unbroken the
three spinors produce a full quaternion algebra with ba-
sis {1, i, j, k}, such that its group of automorphisms carry
the combined symmetry. if we add to the space of these
quaternion wave functions a hilbert product compati-
ble with the quaternion algebra we obtain a quaternionic
hilbert space. this space should reduce to the usual
hilbert space of complex quantum mechanics with sepa-
rate spin, isospin plus one extra spinor degree of freedom
at the level of the combined symmetry breaking.

as it is well known, the above matrix corresponds to
a vector eld in space-time, associated to a pair of two
aba  b. a possible interpre-
component spinors  = 
tation for this pair of spinors is given by the spin and
isospin states in a su (2) model [11,12,13,14].

since the inner automorphism of the quaternion alge-
bra correspond to the isometries of space-time, the exis-
tence of a combined spin-isospin structure also have im-
plications on the classical notion of derivative of a func-
tion.
in ordinary complex analysis the derivative of a
function does not depend on the direction in the com-
plex plane along which the limit is taken. this has to be
so because the complex plane is generated by only one
real and one imaginary direction, leading to the cauchy-
riemann conditions for analyticity. on the other hand,
in the the quaternionic case there are three imaginary
directions generating a space that is isomorphic to ir3,
where in principle there is no reason for the derivatives
to be all equal. this means that the properties of dif-
ferentiable equations involving quaternion functions of a
quaternionic variable does not necessarily coincide with
those of ordinary complex quantum theory. fortunately

greek indices are space-time indices and they run from 0
to 3. small case latin indices run from 1 to 3. capital latin
indices are spinor indices running from 1 to 2. the quaternion
multiplication table is taken to be

eiej = ij +x ijkek,

eie0 = e0ei = ei

the conjugate of a quaternion x is x, with ei = ei, e0 =

e0. the quaternion norm is |x|2 =p(x )2 and the inverse

of x is x 1 = x/|x|.

this can be examined through the methods of classical
analysis.

iii. analysis of quaternion fields

the earliest known study on the analysis of quater-
nion functions using the same concepts of complex anal-
ysis was made by fueter in 1932, nding very restrictive
generalizations of the cauchy-riemann conditions [16].
some alternative criteria for dening quaternion analyt-
icity have been suggested [17,18,19,20,21,22], but to date
there is not a consensus on what is meant by quaternion
analyticity. to understand the nature of the diculties
we need to start from the basic principles. denoting a

generic quaternion function by f (x) =p u(x)e, and

f = [f (x + x)  f (x)] we may dene its left deriva-
tive as

from direct calculation we nd that

f (x)(0) = f (x)(0)

f (x)(j) = f (x)(j)  2xi,k

ijk ui
xj

ek

imposing that these derivatives are selectively equal, four
basic classes of complex-like analytic functions are ob-
tained

class a) right analytic functions

f (x)(0) = f (x)(i)

f (x)(i) = f (x)(j) (cid:27) 


u

(4)

f (x) = limx0f (x)(x)1,

class b) left analytic functions

and the right derivative as

f (x) = limx0(x)1f (x)

where the limits are taken with |x|  0 along the
direction of the four-vector x which depends on the
3-dimensional vector ~x.

to compare with the complex case, we may use the
form of a quaternion: a vector of ir3,

exponential

i and square 2 =  = p x 2

2 = 1, we may construct a gauss plane generated by
 and the quaternion unit e0.
in this plane a quater-

 = p xiei associate a quaternion  with norm ||2 =
  = p x 2
ing the unit quaternion (iota)  = /p  such that
nion x = x0e0 + p xiei can be expressed as x =
|x|(cos +  sin ), with tan  = x0/pp x 2

fore, if we dene the quaternion exponential as

i . there-

i . den-

exp() = e = cos + sin,

and x 1 =
then we may express x = |x|e
e/|x|, where the three dimensional direction is in-
cluded in the denition of .

contrasting with the complex case, we cannot neglect
the phase factor e during the limiting process because
we have a functions depending on three variables. the
independence of the limit with the phase is a privilege
(or rather a limitation) of complex theory. furthermore,
here we have the added complication that the left and
right derivatives do not necessarily coincide. to see the
consequences of this, consider the derivatives of a quater-
nion function f (x) along a xed direction x = xe
(no sum), indicated by the index within parenthesis

as we can see, these conditions are very restrictive, spe-
cially when we consider the applications to quantum me-
chanics, suggesting the adoption of dierent criteria for
analyticity.

iv. harmonicity

consider the operator / =p e =p e/x act-

ing on the right and on the left of a function f (x)

/f (x) = (

(9)

using these results four new classes of quaternion func-
tions can be dened:

class e) the functions such that

/f (x) = f (x)/ n ui

are the components of the quaternion function f (x) =
ue. we can easily see that f (x) satisfy the condi-
i =
2x0. in fact, this is a particular case of a wider class of
quaternion functions with components u = g(x)/(1 +
|x|2), where g(x) are some real functions. the case of
instantons correspond to the choice g0 = 1
i and
gi = g0
. it is also interesting to notice that the anti
xi
instantons do not belong to the same class of analyticity
as the instantons.

v. integral theorems

given a quaternion function f (x) dened on a ori-
entable 3-dimensional hypersurface s with, unit normal
vector  we may dene two integrals

zs

f (x)ds, and zs

dsf (x)

where ds = p dsiei denotes the quaternion hypersur-

face element with components

ds0 = dx1dx2dx3, ds1 = dx0dx2dx3,
ds2 = dx0dx1dx3, ds3 = dx0dx1dx2.

on the other hand, denoting by dv = dx0dx1dx2dx3
the 4-dimensional volume element in a region  bounded
by s, we obtain after integrating in one of the variables
we obtain

eeudv =

z
z

/f (x)dv =z
[(0u0 xi

notice that for the classes f, g and h we have

and noting that

= 22u0 = 0

where 22 = //. similarly, 22uk = 0, so that those
classes describe harmonic functions in the sense that
22f (x) = 0.

it follows that

a non trivial example of class h quaternion function is
given by a instantons eld expressed in terms of quater-
nions [23]. the connection of an anti self dual su (2)
gauge eld is given by the form

/f (x)dv =zs

it is a simple matter to see that this is exactly the same
expression of the surface integral

zs

dsf (x) =xzs

therefore, we obtain the result

/f (x)dv =zs

and similarly we obtain for the left hypersurface integral

which vanish on account of greens theorem in the (i, j)
plane. the following result extends the rst cauchys
theorem for quaternion functions:

if f (x) is of h class in the interior of a region 

bounded by a hypersurface s then

x2 = rcos sin sin and x3 = rcos cos where
  (0, ),   (0, 2),   (/2, /2). with this,
the coordinates x0, x1, x2, x3 correspond to the co-
ordinates of a space-time point with quaternion norm
|x|2 = r2, while  span values from the past to the fu-
ture. then the volume element is dv = jdrddd where
j = 3cos2 sin  is the jacobian determinant. using
the polar form, the unit normal to the sphere centered at
p can be written as  = e and x  p = e = , so
that

zs0

(x  p )3ds =zs0

e2sin2sin d d d = 2

after replacing in (19) we obtain the result (18).

notice that the power (3) in (18) is not accidental
as it is the right power required to cancel the jacobian
determinant as   0.

zs

f (x)ds =zs

dsf (x) = 0

(17)

vi. power series

this follows immediately from eqns. (15), (16) and the
condition for a class h function (13) where /f (x) = 0
and f (x)/ = 0.

the second cauchys theorem is also true only for class

h functions

if f (x) satisfy the conditions of class h, in a region
bounded by a simple closed 3-dimensional hypersurface s,
then for p  s,

f (p ) =

1

2 zs

f (x)(x  p )3ds

(18)

in fact, the integrand does not satisfy the class h con-
ditions in  as it is not dened at p and consequently
the previous theorem does not apply. however this point
may be isolated by a sphere with surface s0 with center
at p and radius  such that it is completely inside .
applying the previous theorem in the region bounded by
s and s0 we obtain

zs

f (x)(x  p )3ds +zs0

f (x)(x  p )3ds = 0

now, the primary condition for a function belonging to
class e through h is that its components are regular
so that we may calculate their taylor series around p :
u(x) = u(p )+ u
x p +   . using this expansion in
the integral over s0 and taking the limit   0, it follows
that

f (p ) =(cid:18)zs

f (x)(x p )3ds(cid:19)(cid:18)zs0

(x p )3ds(cid:19)1

(19)

in order to calculate the integral over the sphere it is
convenient to use four dimensional spherical coordinates
(r, , , ), such that x0 = rsin, x1 = rcos sin cos,

to conclude, consider the particular function f (x) =
(1  x)3, with |x| < 1. it is a simple matter to see
that it can be expanded as

(1x)3 =

n(n + 1)

2

x n1 =



x1

(m+1)(m+2)

2



xm=0

x m

(20)

using this particular case we may prove the following
general result for quaternion functions:

let f (x) be of class h inside a region  bounded by a
surface s. then for all x inside  there are coecients
an such that

f (x) =



x0

an(x  q)n

(21)

the proof is a straightforward adaptation from the sim-
ilar complex theorem.
if s0 is the largest sphere in 
centered at q, the integral (18) for a point p = x inside
 gives

f (x) =

1

2 zs

f (x )(x q)3[1(x q)1(xq)]3ds 


assuming that |x  q| < |x   q| and using (20), the
integrand is equivalent to

[1  (x   q)1(x  q)]3
m=

(m + 1)(m + 2)

(x   q)m(x  q)m

2

=

x0

so that

xm=0

f (x )(x   q)3m(x  q)mds 


(22)

f (x) =

now we may write (xq)m = mem and ds 
and it follows that

 = eds ,

(xq)mds 

ds 

(xq)m = ds (emeeem) = 0

therefore (22) is equivalent to

xm=0

(m + 1)(m + 2)

f (x )(x   q)3mds (x  q)m

f (x) =

or, after dening the coecients

we obtain (21).

 (23)

this important result shows that class h functions
can be expressed as a convergent positive power series.
therefore the class h or the latter property could be
taken to represent a class of analyticity for quaternion
functions, in the same sense of the real and complex an-
alyticity. however, unlike the complex case from (13)
we see that their derivatives depend on the direction in
which the limit is taken.

the the power expansions would also have negative pow-
ers and the associated poles as points in space-time and
their corresponding residues [19].

the harmonic property implicit in class h implies in
the possibility that the quaternion quantum elds and
states can be represented in terms of quaternionic fourier
expansions, something that is required to represent the
quaternion wave packets. as it has been noted, quater-
nion analyticity does not imply that the derivatives are
independent of direction in space and in this respect com-
plex analysis and the corresponding quantum theory may
be considered to be somewhat limited as compared with
quaternion analysis. the direction dependent property
should be detectable at the level of the combined sym-
metry

it is conceivable that the characterization of analytic-
ity either by class h or more generally by positive power
series expansions will not hold at higher energy levels,
where the wave functions are subjected to fast variation
at a sort time. in this case, the best we may hope that
these functions remain dierentiable and any appeal to
analyticity in the sense of a converging power series may
be regarded as an unduly luxury.
in this respect, the
above results may hold for quaternions quantum mechan-
ics at an intermediate energy theory, where the combined
symmetry includes the su (2) group. for higher energies
we would expect the emergence of the su (3) group and
the octonion algebra.

vii. discussion

[1] f. jordan, j. von neumann & e. p. wigner, ann. maths.

at the level of an unbroken su (2) gauge theory the
algebraic properties of the spinors predicts a combined
spin-isospin angular momentum here called the k-spin
(after i-spin for complex and j-spin for isospin). the three
resulting spinors give way to a full quaternionic spinor op-
erator obtained from the linear combination of the pauli
matrices in a specic representation. in this way, we con-
clude that quaternion quantum mechanics may be eec-
tive at the level of the combined spinor symmetry. the
quaternionic spinor operator naturally associates a vec-
tor in space-time whose physical interpretation depends
on the su (2) model of gauge eld considered. we have
suggested the t hooft-poliakov monopole as a possible
interpretation of that vector eld.

the emergence of quaternionic spinor elds requires a
proper analysis of quaternion functions of a quaternionic
variable. we have shown that there is a class of ana-
lytic quaternion functions which can be represented by
a positive power series, a property which is shared with
the other two associative division algebras (the real and
complex functions). outside the conditions for class h
