1 introduction:

gravity is the most time honored force.
it is an extremely beautiful and
successful theory. on the other hand,particle physics is basis the for all
natural phenomena other than the gravitational ones and it is well estab-
lished that it is described by quantum eld theory. we thus have two
fundamental theories,quantum eld theory and general relativity. unfortu-
nately,however,these two theories have quite dierent structure. the former
is a quantum theory,while the latter is a classical one,the former is based
on the xed minkowski space-time,while in the tatter the metric g is a
dynamical and space time dependent quantity.

it is evidently quite inadequate to regard gravity as an orphan in nature
and particle physics must be enlarged to include gravity. unfortunately any
try to quantize the gravitation theory of einstein were unsuccessful. the rea-
son is that the divergences encountered are totally out of control in perturba-
tion theory and are non-removable. in other words gravitational anomalies
associated with the breakdown of classical symmetries (general coordinate
invariance) arise in the process of quantization. conceptually. the appear-
ance of such anomalies is quite drastic since it signals the incompatibility of
general relativity with the quantization procedure.

one way,to try to solve this problem is to enlarge the symmetry group of
this theory (at the classical level) in order to absorb the variance encountered
anomalies and probably get a consistent quantum theory of gravitation.

recently,a generalized version of general relativity baptized ngt (non-
symmetric gravity theory) was proposed[1]-[7]. regarding the ngt classical
tests,they are successful and consistent with all the solar system tests of
general relativity (gr) [1]-[3].

to have a better understanding of this new theory and probably nd
a solution to the divergence problem and the unication program with the
other interactions,the quantum version in the framework of the canonical
operator formalism[8]-[13].

it turns and that the theory contains a larger symmetry manifested by
the algebraic structure of conserved quantities such as fadeev popov ghosts
and brst charges etc. . .

it is the purpose of this paper to study and to construct such symme-
in section 2,we introduce quantum ngt. in section 3,we
try generators.

the corresponding symmetries and establish various equal time canonical(and

conclusions.

2 quantum nonsymmetric gravity (qngt):

it was shown in our ref[8]. that the pure total qngt lagrangian density
can be expressed as:

tot = g + gf + f p + lgf + lf p + agf

(2.1)

where

g = ghg r (w )  2e  1
f p = gh(g + g) + g()(cid:16) + (cid:17)i
gf = bg() (b +  b)

where  and  are anticommuting number,and the symbol  means hyper-
bolic complex conjugate.

3 symmetries of qngt:

regarding the brst transformations g
brst the conserved noether current
j  can be easily constructed and the corresponding time independent brst
charge q derived such that

q = z d3x j 0 (x)

4

(3.1)

here,we have assumed that j  vanishes at spatial innity and that the
integral (3. 1) convergent. if eq. (3. 1) is not convergent q is a dened as
charge operator,that is,we can not consider eigenstates of q (no expectation values).
but we can still meaningfully consider

[q, f (y)] = z d3x hj 0 (x) , f (y)i

(3.2)

for any local quantity f (y),because [j 0 (x) , f (y)] vanishes identically

if | x | is suciently large.

straightforward calculations lead to:

q = z d3x

6xi=1

i

(3.3)

where:

4 = 

0 + w

0  w

1 =  (bg0 + bg0 + bg0) b
2 = bg (w
3 = (cid:16) 
2bg0 + bg[0](cid:17) (w
2bg0 (w
  )
5 = [g (bg0 + bg0) + g (bg0 + bg0)] b
6 = bg() [(0) b + (0) b]

0  0)

  w

(3.4)
regarding the f. p ghost charge and unlike the usual case of fermion
number conservation,the conservation of the f. p ghost number is not due
to the invariance under a phase transformation:

0  )

  e

 e




with 2 = 1 ( is a hyperbolic complex number).
in fact,such a phase transformations is incompatible with our funda-

mental, hermiticity assignement(in the sense of hyperbolic complex) e =
, e = . instead,an invariance exists under the scalar transformation

(3.5)

(3.6)

with a real parameter  which is fully consistent with the hermiticity of
 and charge

 and . now,we can construct the corresponding current j 

  e
  e

5

q called the f. p ghost current and charge respectively. indeed,the latter
generates the above transformations on the f. p ghost elds and leaves all
other elds invariant. the f. p ghost number nf p is then identied with
the eigenvalue of the operator qmultiplied by . although it may ssound
strange that the hermitian operator has pure imaginary eigenvalues,this is
fully consistent in the presence of indenite metric:whenever pure imaginary
eigenvalues nf p appear,they are in complex hyperbolic conjugate pairs
with +nf p . this fact is very important not only for guaranteeing the
hermiticity of q,but also for materializing the norm-cancellation mechanism
to conrm unphysical ghosts with negative morms which is necessary to
ensure the s matrix unitarity.

now,after direct simplications we obtain

q = z d3x {[(bg + bg)(cid:16)g 0
+bg() (0 + 0) + bg()(cid:16)0
)(cid:16) + (cid:17)]}
+ (bg0

 + bg0

 + g0
 + 0

(cid:17) +
(cid:17)

(3.7)

since the time coordinates plays a special role in the canonical quan-
tization (as it will be clear after,one may feel uneasy about the manifest
covariance of the theory. thanks to the invariance,this covariance is mani-
festly guaranteed in the canonical formalism. for translations and gl (4, r)
transformation,the noether theorem implies that the canonical energy mo-
mentum t 

 and angular momentum m 

 are given respectively by:

t

m

(3.11)
consequently,the translation and gl (4, r) generators are given respec-

tively by:

and

p  z d3x t 0



m 

  z d3x m 0



(3.12)

(3.13)

now,after setting up the various generators and in order to determine
their algebra as well as their actions on the dynamical elds,one has to cal-
culate rst the canonical equal time (anti) commutation relations between
the primary elds. it is quite remarkable,as it will be clear later that all the
equal time commutators can be obtained in closed form.

the primary elds are g, , , w 

, b. according to the dirac method
of quantization,the canonical quantization comied ont by taking g, w 
 , 
and  as canonical variables but not b. the canonical conjugates of
g, , w

, and  are respectively as follows:



b + g(0)gb + 0

bi
 (g) = gh0
 (w ) = hbg0
i + 
  bg0
2 (bg0
)(cid:16) + (cid:17) + bg()(cid:16)0
 () = (bg0
(cid:16)(cid:17) = (bg + bg)(cid:16)g 0

  bg[]
 + bg0

  g0

)

 (cid:17)

 + 0

(cid:17) + bg() (0 + 0)

(3.14)

thus,the non vanishing canonical (anti) commutation relations are:

7

[

 (w ) (x) , w


 (x)] = i

3(cid:18)x  x(cid:19)
[ (g) (x) ,bg (x)] = i
{ () (x) ,  (x)} = i3(cid:18)x  x(cid:19)
n () (x) ,  (x)o = i3(cid:18)x  x(cid:19)





3(cid:18)x  x(cid:19)

(3.15)

now,by using the relation (3. 9) and (3. 12),it is straightforward to con-
 are indeed the translation and gl (4, r) generators

rm that p and m 
respectively:

] = w

[p, g] = g

[p, ] =

(3.16)

furthermore,we can explicitly show that they corectly form the ane

algebra:

[p, p] = 0
[m 

, p] = 
i =

p

hm 

  

m 



(3.18)

concerning the brst and f. p charges and using the relation (3. 3) one

can show the following simple algebraic structure:

{q, q} = 0
[q, q] = q
[q, qf p ] = 0

8

(3.19)

note that,although the above algebraic structure lokes very simple,it plays
a vitally important role in combination with the characteristic feature of
q in insuring the physical s matrix unitarity through theconnement
of unphysical particles with negative norms. moreover a simple calculation
shows that the action of q and on various q on various elds can be seen
from the following (anti) commutation relations:

[q, g] = ig + g
{q, } = 0
nq, o = b
hq, w

i = w

  w

[q, b] = 0
[q, ] = 

[q, g] = hq, w 
hq, i = 

i = 0

 + w

  

(3.20)

regarding the brst transformation l

brst related to the local gl (4, r)
transformations,one can show easily that the corresponding charge ql has
as expression:

ql = z d3x

5xi=1

4 conclusions:

we have studied in this paper the symmetries of qngt and construct the
corresponding generators as well as the various equal time (anti)commutation
relations establish. regarding the huge symmetry,one may anticipate that
there is a hope to solve the problem of the renormalizabilility of the quantum
gravity [9]-[14].
