abstract

we realize the two dimensional anti-de sitter (ads2) space as a kaluza-

klein reduction of the ads3 space in the framework of the discrete light cone

quantization (dlcq). introducing dlcq coordinates which interpolate the

original (unboosted) coordinates and the light cone coordinates, we discuss

that ads2/cf t correspondence can be deduced from the ads3/cf t .

in

particular, we elaborate on the deformation of wzw model to obtain the

boundary theory for the ads2 black hole. this enables us to derive the

entropy of the ads2 black hole from that of the ads3 black hole.

one of the main progresses achieved recently in the string theory is the ads/cf t

duality [1,2], which connects the gravity in the d-dimensional anti-de sitter (adsd) space

and the (d  1) dimensional conformal eld theory (cf t ) on its boundary. among the
ads/cf t dualities in the various dimensions are the ads3/cf t and ads2/cf t dualities

relevant for the black hole physics, since most of the black holes in the string theories are

known to contain either ads3 space or ads2 space in their near horizon geometries [1,3].

thus, the ads/cf t dualities in low dimensions would play a key role in understanding the

quantum aspects of the black holes. however, compared with the case of the ads3/cf t

duality [46] the ads2/cf t duality is less well discussed in the literature. observing that

the near horizon geometry of the three dimensional btz (banados-teitelboim-zanelli) black

hole [7] becomes eectively ads2 in the low energy regime, one may attempt to derive the

ads2/cf t duality from the known ads3/cf t . this approach was taken by strominger

in his recent work on ads2/cf t duality [8].

here in this paper we will employ a dierent strategy to derive the ads2/cf t duality,

namely the dlcq (discrete light cone quantization) [9], which reveals the relationship be-

tween two dualities more transparently. if the btz black hole is viewed in the light cone

frame along the circle direction, the metric components in the light like directions are con-

stant and can be scaled by boosting the frame. thus, if the light cone coordinate, x is

taken to be periodic, the kaluza-klein compactication can be easily performed. in order

to have a periodic light cone coordinate, we employ the dlcq procedure, which has been

discussed recently [10] in the context of the matrix m-theory [11]. it is found useful to in-

troduce dlcq coordinates, which interpolate the original (unboosted) coordinates and the

light cone ones when we apply the dlcq procedure to the ads3 black hole. one advantage

of this approach is that we do not need to conne ourselves to the near horizon region.

let us begin with the well-known d1-d5 black hole in ten dimensions, which has its

near horizon geometry as mbt z  s3  t 4 [12]

here we note that the btz black hole becomes bps object as we take the limit   
while keeping m, j nite by making u0  0; in this limit m  j/l  0.

it is tempting to reduce the three dimensional black hole to a two dimensional ads black

hole by the kaluza-klein (kk) reduction. the early attempt was made in ref. [13], where
the four dimensional extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole is described as ads2  s2:
the btz black hole can be viewed as a two dimensional dilatonic ads black hole with a

u(1) charge, when we apply the kk reduction along the spatial s1 direction to the btz

black hole. a more elaborated description of ads2 is given by strominger in his recent work

[8], by taking the very near horizon limit of the extremal black hole.

in this paper we take the kk reduction along nearly lightlike circle rather than along

the spatial circle. we rst give naive idea on this. the metric of the btz black hole in the

light cone frame becomes

ds2 =

(4)

where x = (x5  t)/2. it suggests that the light cone coordinate, x may be chosen to be

compactied, since the dilaton is constant. here we need to employ the dlcq procedure

in order to have a periodic light like coordinate. the dlcq procedure has been recently

discussed [10] in the context of the matrix m-theory [11]. so some part of the analysis to

be presented also will be useful to study the matrix m-theory. let us suppose that x5 is

3

periodic, x5  x5 + 2rs, i.e., (x+, x)  (x+ + 2rs, x + 2rs). then by a lorentz
boost, we have (x+, x)  (x++2rse, x+2rse), rs/r = (cosh 2) 1

2 , where

x = ex are the boosted light cone coordinates. in the limit of the large boosting, i.e.
when the boosting parameter   , (equivalently rs  0 with r kept nite), x
becomes periodic; (x+, x)  (x+, x + 2r).

the metric reads in terms of the boosted coordinates as,

2u 2(u 2  u0

(5)

here we observe that the dilaton factor, i.e., the compactication radius is constant and x+
plays the role of time coordinate. in the dlcq limit, the geometry becomes ads2  s1.

however in order to be more transparent on the deformation of a spatial circle to make

a nearly light like circle, we introduce new coordinates (t, u, x), called dlcq coordinates,

which interpolate the original coordinates (t, u, x5) (when  = 0) and the innitely boosted

light cone coordinates (x+, u, x) (when   ): (t, x)  (t, x + 2rscosh 2),

x =

ex+ + ex
e2 + e2

,

t =

ex+  ex
e2 + e2

.

(6)

in the boosted frame x is identied as a periodic coordinate and the time coordinate t

is chosen such that t is orthogonal to x.
t  x+ = ex+ and x  x = ex.

in the innite boosting limit (  ),

in this dlcq coordinates, the metric reads as

ds2 =

(9)

thus, the ads2 black hole can be described in terms of the extremal ads3 black hole in

the framework of dlcq. in passing we note that the way the dlcq procedure results

in the extremal limit is dierent from the usual one;   , and rs  0 so that
r e = rs cosh 2 e+ is kept nite.

the dlcq coordinates are more useful when we discuss the boundary conformal eld

theory. in ref. [5], one of the authors explicitly showed that the boundary conformal eld

theory is given by a sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) wzw model, which is equivalent to the three
dimensional gravity on ads3, resorting to the faddeev-shatashvili procedure [14]. since

ads2 space is obtained by the kaluza-klein reduction from ads3, the same procedure

would lead us to the boundary conformal theory corresponding to the ads2 space. we rst

give the dlcq reduction of the bulk chern-simons action [15], which may be rewritten as

from the metric for the btz black hole in the light cone frame eq.(4), we obtain the

among those, only the components ax and ax are physically important because the nontriv-

ial geometrical structure of the three dimensional space is completely encoded by holonomies

or wilson loops of the chern-simons gauge elds [16], w [c] = p exp (hc axdx) ,
p exp(cid:16)hc
in the limit where   , ax  2 u0e

axdx(cid:17), where c is a closed curve and p denotes a path ordered product. since
ax  0, we see that the the right sl(2, r)
sector becomes trivial while the left sl(2, r) sector remains relevant. it is consistent with

the observation that the dlcq and scaling procedure results in the bps limit. this also

explains how the isometry group of ads3, sl(2, r)sl(2, r) reduces to the isometry group
of ads2, sl(2, r) in the framework of dlcq.

rewriting the boundary action obtained in ref. [5] in terms of the dlcq coordinates,

we nd that the boundary theory for ads2 may be given by the wzw model, deformed by

the dlcq procedure. the total action is composed of the followings;

r (e2t, x) we may identify i as the left sector of the action
where i, j  (u, x). with (, ) = 1
for the btz black hole given in ref. [5]. we also nd that i can be understood as the right

sector of the action for the btz black hole in terms of ( , ) = 1

r(e2t, x). the right sector

is conned in the extreme low energy regime, thus, suppressed. the left sl(2, r) sector

only becomes relevant to the ads2.

the dlcq procedure presented here illustrates explicitly how ads2/cf t correspon-

dence can be deduced from the ads3/cf t . it would be interesting to explore its conse-

quences in various contexts. one may nd an application of the dlcq procedure readily

in evaluation of the entropy for the ads2 black hole. to evaluate the entropy, we adopt the

result of ref. [5], where the entropy of the three dimensional btz black hole is evaluated in

accord with the proposal of strominger [17]. comparing the boundary action for the ads2

(12) with that for the btz black hole, given in ref. [5], we nd that the the expectation

values of the virasoro generators l0 and l0 for the ads2 black hole are given by

nl =< l0 >=

ku0

nr =< l0 >=

ku0

,

2r2e2
2l4

e4.

(13)

here we assume that nl = nr = 0 for an appropriately chosen vacuum state of the black

hole. then it follows from the cardy formula that the entropy for the ads2 black hole is

evaluated as

s = 2k

ru0e

l2

+ 2k

e2.

(14)

as   , the right sector does not contributes to the entropy, s  4kgm . (some

diculty in evaluating the entropy by applying the cardy formula to the boundary conformal

theory was pointed out by carlip [18]. this diculty may be resolved if we consider the

space-time virasoro algebra, regarding the boundary conformal theory as the worldsheet

action for the string on ads3 [6]. it would be worth while to extend the work of ref. [5]

along this direction.)

we conclude this paper with a few brief remarks. we show that the ads2 black hole can

be described as a dlcq limit of the ads3 black hole. the boundary theory for ads2 is found

to be a sl(2, r) wzw model dened on the light like coordinate. if we are concerned with

the gravity on ads2, the zero mode sector of the ads3 suces in the framework of dlcq.

in accordance with it, the zero mode sector of the wzw model given by the action eq.(12)

denes the boundary theory, hence a sl(2, r) quantum mechanics. the correspondence

between the gravity on ads2 and the sl(2, r) boundary conformal quantum mechanics

will be discussed in detail elsewhere. we note that the entropy of the ads2 black hole

evaluated as eq.(14) is the same as that of the ads3 black hole in the original frame. thus,

the entropy is preserved by the dlcq procedure.

the present paper may be extended along various directions. one of the direction would

be the dlcq reduction of the string on ads3 [6]. it would be interesting to see if the dlcq

reduction leads us to a point source on ads2 and the entropy of ads2 black hole can be

given by the quantum mechanics. this may clarify some subtle issues associated with the

entropy of black holes in ads3 and ads2. the two dimensional black holes have been one

of the important subjects in string theory and gravity. the present work may enable us to

discuss the various aspects of the two dimensional black holes [19,20] from the viewpoint of

the three dimensional black hole. according to the conjecture of ads/cf t correspondence

[1] the (2+1) dimensional gravity on ads3 is supposed to be equivalent to the boundary

(1+1) dimensional conformal yang-mills theory on its boundary. the present work also

suggests that the boundary conformal theory corresponding to the gravity on ads2 may

be obtained by the dlcq reduction of the (1+1) dimensional yang-mills theory. work

along this direction is now in progress [21]. the most important application of the present

work may be found in the matrix m-theory. dlcq reduction of the m-brane congurations

may shed some light on the matrix m-theory. after completing the work, we found that

reduction of ads3 to ads2 along the light like coordinate also has been suggested in the

study of m-brane congurations [22].
