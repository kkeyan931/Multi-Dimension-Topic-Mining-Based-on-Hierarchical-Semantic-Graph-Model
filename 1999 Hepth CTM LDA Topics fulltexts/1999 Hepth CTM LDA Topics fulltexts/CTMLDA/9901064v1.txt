supersymmetrization of generalized

freedman-townsend models

friedemann brandt1 and ulrich theis

institut fur theoretische physik, universitat hannover,

appelstr. 2, d30167 hannover, germany

abstract: we review briey generalized freedman-townsend models found recently
by henneaux and knaepen, and provide supersymmetric versions of such models in four
dimensions which couple 2-form gauge potentials and ordinary gauge elds in a gauge
invariant and supersymmetric manner. the latter models have the unusual feature that,
in a wz gauge, the supersymmetry transformations do not commute with all the gauge
transformations.

1 motivation

we report on work [1] which was motivated by two recent developments. one of these
is the construction of new four dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories [2]
by gauging the central charge of n = 2 vector-tensor multiplets [3]. the other one
is a classication of possible gauge invariant interactions of p-form gauge potentials [4]
in any spacetime dimension. it turned out that these two developments overlap: non-
supersymmetric limits of the models [2], obtained by neglecting the fermions and freezing
scalars to constants, are contained in a class of gauge theories found in [4]. the latter
gauge theories generalize n-dimensional freedman-townsend models [5]:
in addition to
the (n  2)-form gauge potentials present in freedman-townsend models, they contain
p-form gauge potentials with p < n  2 interacting with each other and with the (n  2)-
form gauge potentials. we call such gauge theories henneaux-knaepen models. specied
to four spacetime dimensions, they give interactions between 2-form gauge potentials and
ordinary gauge elds. the n = 2 supersymmetric models [2] may thus be regarded
as supersymmetric versions of special henneaux-knaepen models. a natural question in
this context is whether more general henneaux-knaepen models can be supersymmetrized
too. our work provides n = 1 supersymmetric versions of such models in four spacetime
dimensions.

interactions between p-form gauge potentials

we rst briey review some of the results obtained by henneaux and knaepen [4]. their
starting point is the free action for a set of p-form gauge potentials aa with various

the free action is of course invariant under the standard abelian gauge transformations

(0)
 aa = da

(2)

where a is an arbitrary (pa  1)-form.

the classication of gauge invariant interactions between the aa performed in [4] pro-
ceeds along the lines of [6]. one seeks the possible consistent deformations s and  of
the free action and its gauge symmetries. these are deformations such that the deformed
action is invariant under the deformed gauge transformations,

s = s(0) + gs(1) + g2s(2) + . . .

 + . . . ) s != 0,

 + g(1)

 + g2(2)

(3)

where g is a continuous deformation parameter. a deformation is called trivial if it can
be removed by local eld redenitions of the aa

.

1...pa

to rst order in g, (3) imposes that s(1) be (0)

-invariant on-shell. hence, the general



form of s(1) is

s(1) = s(1)

inv + s(1),

 s(1)

inv = 0,

s(1)  0

(4)

where  denotes weak (on-shell) equality.

s(1)
inv contains polynomials in the eld strengths f a

1...pa+1 and derivatives thereof. more-
over it contains the possible abelian chern-simons terms that can be constructed from
the aa present in the free model under study. a remarkable result is the following.

theorem [4].

if pa  {2, . . . , n  2} a, then s(1) can be assumed to be a linear

combination of terms of the form

r (f a1)  . . .  (f ar )  f ar+1  . . .  f ar+s  aar+s+1 ,
r 6= 0, pr

i=1(n  pai  1) +pr+s

i=r+1(pai + 1) + par+s+1 = n.

(5)
(6)

in (6), r 6= 0 guarantees that (5) does not reduce to a chern-simons term (the latter is
already contained in s(1)
inv). the second condition in (6) expresses the requirement that
the integrand of (5) be a volume-form.

the above theorem does not hold in presence of 1-form gauge potentials. namely, then
s(1) can contain additional terms which cannot be cast in the form (5). an example is

the cubic yang-mills vertex fabcr aa  ab  f c (fabc = f[abc], pa = 1 a) which contains

the product of two undierentiated gauge potentials, in contrast to (5).

note that (6) imposes conditions on the interaction terms (5). these conditions can
be rather severe. consider for instance the case that all the p-form gauge potentials have
the same degree, i.e., pa = p for all a. then (6) yields (r  1)(n  2  p) + s(p + 1) = (2  r)
whose left hand side is nonnegative for p  n  2 whereas the right hand side is negative
for r > 2. examining the two remaining cases r = 1, 2, one nds that p = n  2, r = 2,
s = 0 is the only solution with p 6 {0, n}. this solution yields precisely the freedman-
townsend vertices. when, in addition to (n  2)-forms, there are also p-forms with other
degrees, then (6) has further solutions of a similar type, namely (r, s) = (2, 0), p1 = n  2,
p2 = p3 arbitrary. the corresponding vertices (5) are given by

z (f a)  (f b)  ac,

2

pa = n  2,

pb = pc.

(7)

as also shown in [4], linear combinations kabcr (f a)  (f b)  ac of these vertices can

be completed to a consistent deformation of the free theory to all orders in g if the
coecients kabc with pa = pb = pc are the structure constants of an arbitrary lie algebra
g (not necessarily compact) and the other coecients kabc dene representation matrices
of g. furthermore, the complete deformation can be elegantly constructed in rst order
form by means of auxiliary 1-forms.

in four spacetime dimensions, the resulting models couple 2-form gauge potentials and
ordinary gauge elds. henceforth we denote the former by ba, the latter by aa, and the
auxiliary 1-forms by v a,

ba =

dx  dxba , aa = dxaa

v a = dxv a

in the rst order formulation, the deformed action and gauge transformations read

s = r [f a(v )  ba + 1

3 d=4, n=1 supersymmetric henneaux-knaepen models

we shall now briey outline our method [1] to supersymmetrize all the models dened
through (813). we rst construct a superspace version of these models, generalizing
earlier work [8] on supersymmetric freedman-townsend models. to that end we associate
an appropriate supereld with each of the forms in (8),

thanks to the chirality of

 , the following lagrangian is manifestly super-

l = z d2 [w aa + aby ay b + d2  abv av b] + c.c.

this lagrangian gives indeed a supersymmetric version of (9). this is seen by working out
l in component form and by verifying that it is gauge invariant, up to a total derivative,

gauge transformations (10) and (11):

a, aa and v a which are the counterparts of the

here ca and a are arbitrary real vector superelds and chiral superelds respectively
( d a = 0).

now, the gauge transformations (18) and (19) act as shift symmetries on some of the
component elds of the superelds a and aa. as usual, this means that the action
can actually be written in terms of fewer elds, with a correspondingly reduced gauge
invariance and modied supersymmetry transformations. such a wz gauged version of
the above models is also constructed in [1]. the surviving component elds of a are those
of a real linear multiplet, i.e., a real scalar eld a, a real 2-form gauge potential ba, and
a weyl spinor a. the surviving component elds of aa are a gauge eld aa
, a weyl spinor
a and a real auxiliary eld da. the component elds of v a are auxiliary elds which
may be eliminated using the equations of motion. the supersymmetry algebra closes only
modulo gauge transformations. all these features are expected from the experience with
other supersymmetric gauge theories in the wz gauge, such as standard super yang-
mills theories. however, there is also a remarkable dierence, as compared to other
supersymmetric gauge theories: in the wz gauge constructed in [1], the supersymmetry
transformations do not commute with all the gauge transformations, not even on-shell!
