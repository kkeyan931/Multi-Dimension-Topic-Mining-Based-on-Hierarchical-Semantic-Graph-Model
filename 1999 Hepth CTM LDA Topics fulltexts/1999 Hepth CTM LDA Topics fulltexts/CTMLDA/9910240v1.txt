abstract

the parisi-sourlas mechanism is exhibited in pure yang-mills theory. using the new scalar
degrees of freedom derived from the non-linear gauge condition, we show that the non-perturbative
sector of yang-mills theory is equivalent to a 4d o(1, 3) sigma model in a random eld. we then show
that the leading term of this equivalent theory is invariant under supersymmetry transformations
where x2 +  is unchanged. this leads to dimensional reduction proving the equivalence of the
non-perturbative sector of yang-mills theory to a 2d o(1, 3) sigma model.

introduction

there are now several new ideas on how to conne quarks inside hadrons in recent literature. the
seiberg-witten paper [1] on the spontaneous breaking of n=2 supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) to
n=1 sym is supposed to implement the dual type ii superconductivity model of connement proposed
by mandelstam and t hooft [2]. last year, fadeev and niemi [3] derived an eective eld theory for
knotlike solitons that is supposed to describe the infrared regime of pure yang-mills theory. in both
approaches, connement is essentially achieved through chromoelectric ux tubes, which provide the
linear potential. these mechanisms break local lorentz invariance because of the preferred direction
dened by the ux tube.

there is a third approach to connement, which is based on the non-linear generalization of the
coulomb gauge [4]. in a series of papers [5, 6, 7], this author argued the importance of generalizing the
coulomb gauge to the gauge condition

(  d)(  a) = 0,

(1)

because eld congurations which satisfy   aa = f a 6= 0, and (  d)f = 0, are not gauge transformable
to the coulomb surface. in the non-linear regime (the linear sector being the coulomb gauge) of the
gauge condition (1), the yang-mills potential can be written as

as discussed in reference [7], the eective dynamics of the new scalar eld f a hints at non-perturbative
eects. this was conrmed in reference [4] where the linear behavior of the instantaneous gluon prop-
agator and the area law behavior of the wilson loop were explicitly shown. the mechanism for these
behaviors is not quantum mechanical but simply a statistical treatment of classical solutions of the ac-
tion for pure f s (all spherically symmetric f a(x) in 4d euclidean). this connement mechanism then
maintains local lorentz invariance unlike the mechanisms that make use of chromoelectric ux tubes.

aside from not breaking lorentz invariance, this mechanism relies on a straightforward, though non-
trivial, dierence between abelian and non-abelian theories. in an abelian theory, gauge transformation
is only a translation, thus all orbits pass through the coulomb surface. furthermore, the coulomb
gauge describes the physical degrees of freedom, the transverse photon. but in a non-abelian theory,
gauge transformation is a combination of translation and rotation that depend on the gauge eld
being transformed. this fact leads to complications like gauge copying phenomena [8] and the existence
of gauge elds that cannot be gauge transformed to the coulomb gauge [6, 7]. hence, the proposal
to generalize the coulomb gauge to the non-linear gauge dened by equation 1. note that in the
abelian limit or in the short distance limit (weak coupling), the non-linear gauge reduces to the coulomb
gauge (f = 0). but even before the coupling becomes very large, the fact that the non-linear term is
proportional to p2 (p = momentum) while the linear term depends on p3, the non-linear term would
increasingly be more important in the long-distance regime. the non-zero f terms must now be taken
into account and their dynamics provide the connement mechanism.

in this paper, we will prove a conjecture made in references [4] and [7] on the implementation of the
parisi-sourlas mechanism [9] in pure yang-mills theory. the conjecture is based on two facts. first,
the action for the pure f term is clearly non-perturbative because of ( 1
g2 ) and it is innitely non-linear.
second, the action for f is proportional to (f )4, thus hinting that it can be written as ( s
f )2, where s
is an action with a usual kinetic term ( (f )2). if indeed we can write the action for the f term as
( s
f )2, then its dynamics is stochastic, i.e., driven by a random eld. clearly this hints of the possible
realization of the parisi-sourlas mechanism.

the outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2, we give a detailed derivation of the path-integral
in the non-linear gauge. section 3 will prove the equivalence of the non-perturbative regime of yang-
mills to an o(1, 3) sigma model in random eld. section 4 presents the proof of dimensional reduction.
the conclusion summarizes what the paper achieves.

2 the path-integral in the non-linear gauge

the yang-mills path-integral in the gauge dened by equation 1 is

p i =z (daa

) (  d(  a)) detoesy m (a),

where o is the fadeev-popov operator

oad = (d  )ab(  d)bd  abc(f b)  dcd.

the important point about o is that it is a non-singular operator even though   d is singular [7].
the reason for this is that the gauge transform of a eld conguration that satises   aa = f a, and
(  d)abf b = 0, remains on the surface   aa = f a but no longer in the horizon. this can be seen
by considering an innitesimal parameter a = f a, resulting in an aa
 f b, thus satisfying
  aa = f a, but with (  dab(a))(  ab) = abcdcd
 f df b 6= 0. this should rectify the inconsistent
claim in reference (7) that the eld congurations in the non-linear sector of the non-linear gauge never
leave the horizon yet having a non-singular o.

equations (25,26) give the action for an o(1, 3) sigma model in the non-liner form. equation (24) says
that the non-perturbative regime of yang-mills theory is equivalent to an o(1, 3) sigma model in a
random eld. the rest of this section is devoted to the proof of this claim.

it is interesting to note that if we impose
f = 1, equation (29) gives the interaction term of the
fadeev-niemi action, which supposedly describes knotted strings [3]. this observation shows that indeed
the f a dynamics describes the non-perturbative regime of yang-mills theory.

because of these behaviors, even though each y  integration diverges as y   , the h factor that goes
with it goes to zero faster as x   resulting in a zero for each term. thus,

z d4x h =ix

h nds = 0.

(36)

to complete the proof of the equivalence to an o(1, 3) sigma model in random eld, we need to

establish the following determinant relation

the proportionality constant may be innite but it should be eld f independent. at rst glance,
equation (37) does not seem to make sense because o is a fourth-order dierential operator while 2s
f f
is only second-order. however, as we will show in the following arguments equation (37) is valid.

it is important to note that we can write

and  is the metric given by equation (26). the factoring out of  is important for two reasons. first,

det  = det1(1 +
f ) = det f , and this cancels out the extra determinant at the lhs of equation
(37). second, it leaves 2 without a eld-dependent coecient, which in turn enables us to carry out
the following identication:


f 

det o = det 2 det(2 + m   + r).

(41)

equation (41) implies that the proportionality factor in equation (37) is det 2. it is hinted by the fact
that for f a = constant, o = (2)2 and r = m = 0.

now we prove that equation (41) is true for any f a. neglecting the t dependent term in equation
(31), we nd  aa
 = 0. this does not mean, however, that we are expanding about a eld conguration
on the coulomb surface. equation (2) clearly shows that this is not a case of background decomposition
(where a = a + a) because ta
 is linked in a very nonlinear manner to f a. besides, we are not considering
a particular eld conguration f a. thus, if anything, the vanishing of the divergence of aa
 is purely a
coincidence, but a welcome one because it leads to a signicant amplication of o.

equations (4) and (2), with ta

equations (43,44,45) enable us to write

where

o = (2 + n  )2,

n ab

 = abc ac

since the determinant is invariant under a similarity transformation,

det (2 + n  ) = det (j 1(2 + n  )j) = det (2 + y   + p ),

where

y = 2j 1j + j 1nj,
p = j 12j + j 1nj .

using equations (48,49,50), equation (41) is true if we can nd a j such that

form can be written as in fig 1 where the insertions on the left are m   + p while those on the right

are m   + r. because of the (1 +
f ) factors in the denominators of the insertions, each term is
essentially non-perturbative.


f 

can j be determined by the innite number of global equations given by equation (52)? naively,
the answer is yes because we have innite equations for the innite unknowns (9 components at each
space-time point). we can visualize the problem better if we discretize space-time (lattice formulation).
the set of equations given by (52) becomes a set of non-linear algebraic equations for the values of
j ab(xi).

by choosing a suitable ansatz for j, we can always have the number of equations equal to the number
of unknowns. it should be noted that both sides have divergencies arising from the same point limit of
the green function of 2. this must be handled carefully using a suitable regulator. in the continuum,
what can be done is to solve for a j for n = 1 and then verify the relationship for n = 2, 3, . . .. for n=1,
equation (52) can be solved by the local equations

(63)

equations (61,62,63) are too complicated to have a closed form solution. however, a power series solution
can be given because there are no poles in f . remember that in the non-linear regime f 6= 0 and that
f is always real. this veries the existence of a j that at least satises the one insertion condition of
the trace ln. note that even at the one insertion level, the equality of the determinant is already
non-perturbative.

finally, we answer the question, why not prove equation (41) directly using n? the answer is
aa
 = 0 thus we cannot have an insertion per insertion comparison of the tr lns. the single
simple, x
insertion trace of y   + p is contained in the higher insertion traces of n   and comparison is dicult
to make (but the terms are there but with dierent coecients).

where the numbers in the p i refer to the equation numbers in this paper. note that the last equation
only involves an approximation, because we neglected the other terms in equation (79). since the kinetic
term of f a has the wrong sign, we momentarily shift if a  f a, eectively rotating the o(1, 3) symmetry
to o(4). finally, we introduce the fermion elds for the determinant and the auxillary elds wa and w
to complete the squares of the rst two terms of the exponential to get

equation (83) explicitly shows invariance under equations (68,69,70) and dimensional reduction follows.
then we rotate back f a  if a, yielding again the o(1, 3) sigma model in the linear form but in dimension
reduced by two.

this completes the proof that the non-perturbative regime of yang-mills theory in 4d is equivalent

to a non-linear o(1, 3) sigma model in 2d.

5 conclusion

we have exhibited the parisi-sourlas mechanism in yang-mills theory. since the starting point
of the proof is the scalar eld derived from the non-linear gauge condition, this paper proves further
that the coulomb gauge is not an appropriate gauge xing in non-abelian theories. important eld
congurations will be missed in the path-integral as shown in reference [4], where the linear potential
was derived, and in this paper, where the parisi-sourlas mechanism was exhibited.

it is also important to point out that the derivation of the linear potential is not quantum mechanical
but merely a statistical treatment of a class of classical congurations, i.e., all spherically symmetric
f a(x) in 4d euclidean space. but as this paper showed, taking into account the full dynamics, including
quantum eects, results in dimensional reduction and equivalence to an o(1, 3) sigma model in 2d.
