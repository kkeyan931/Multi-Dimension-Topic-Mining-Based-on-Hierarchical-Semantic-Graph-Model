abstract

supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models are obtained from linear sigma

models by imposing supersymmetric constraints.

if we introduce auxiliary

chiral and vector superelds, these constraints are expressed by d-terms and

f-terms depending on the target manifolds. auxiliary vector superelds ap-

pears as gauge elds without kinetic terms. if there is no d-term constraints,

the target manifolds are always non-compact manifolds. when all the degrees

of freedom in these non-compact directions are eliminated by gauge symme-

tries, the target manifold becomes compact. all supersymmetric nonlinear

sigma models, whose target manifolds are the hermitian symmetric spaces,

are successfully formulated as gauge theories.

1 introduction

when global symmetry g is spontaneously broken down to its subgroup h, there

appears massless nambu-goldstone(ng) bosons corresponding to broken generators

of the coset manifold g/h. at low energies, interactions among these massless par-

ticles are described by the so-called nonlinear sigma models, whose lagrangians are

completely determined by the geometry of the target manifold g/h parameterized

by ng-bosons [1].

in supersymmetric theories, there appear massless fermions as supersymmetric

partners of ng-bosons [2]. these massless fermions together with ng-bosons are

described by chiral superelds in four dimensional theories with n = 1 supersym-

metry. since chiral superelds are complex, the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma

models are closely related to the complex geometry; their target manifolds, where

elds variables take their values, must be kahler manifolds [3]. if the coset mani-

fold g/h itself happens to be a kahler manifold, both real and imaginary parts of

the scalar components of chiral superelds are ng-bosons. if g/h is not a kahler

manifold, on the other hand, there is at least one chiral supereld whose real or

imaginary part is not a ng-boson. this additional massless boson is called the

quasi-nambu-goldstone(qng) boson [2, 4].

the general method to construct supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models has

been discussed by bando, kuramoto, maskawa and uehara (bkmu) [5]. when

qng bosons are present, their eective lagrangians includes arbitrary functions.

this is always the case when the target manifold of the nonlinear sigma model is

larger than the coset manifold g/h where ng-bosons reside, since the geometry of

the target manifold cannot be xed by the metric of its subspace g/h [6][10]. the

arbitrariness reects the ambiguity of the metric in the direction of qng bosons.

when the coset manifold g/h is itself kahler, the eective lagrangian is uniquely

determined by the geometry of g/h, as has been shown in a beautiful paper by

itoh, kugo and kunitomo [11] (see appendix a for a review). kahler potentials in

this case were discussed by many authors [5, 11][18] (see references in ref. [18]),

and were used to construct the coset unication models where fermionic partners of

1

ng bosons are considered as quarks [19].

nonlinear sigma models are considered as low energy eective theories for mass-

less particles after integrating out the massive particles in the corresponding linear

sigma models. in this context, lerche and shore have shown that nonlinear sigma

models whose target manifolds are kahler g/h cannot be obtained from linear

sigma models [6] (see also refs. [7] and appendix b for a review). according to

this theorem, there must exist at least one qng bosons in eective eld theories

obtained from linear sigma models.

on the other hand, it is known that sigma models on some kahler g/h man-

ifolds, namely on cp n or on grassmann manifold gn,m (c), are obtained by the

introduction of gauge symmetry [12, 20, 21, 22]. implicit assumption of lerche and

shore is the absence of gauge interactions in the linear sigma models.

it seems

possible to eliminate unnecessary qng bosons if we introduce appropriate gauge

symmetry.

in this paper, we show that supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models on certain

class of kahler g/h manifolds are obtained from linear sigma models with gauge

symmetry. we dene nonlinear sigma models by imposing supersymmetric con-

straints to linear sigma models. we introduce two kinds of constraints: d-term

and f-term constraints. if we introduce auxiliary elds, these correspond to vector

and chiral superelds. vector auxiliary superelds appear as gauge elds. we will

successfully formulate nonlinear sigma models on (irreducible, compact) hermitian

symmetric spaces1 classied by cartan as in table 1 [24].2

this paper is organized as follows. in sec. 2, we review simple cases without f-

term constraints, namely the projective space cp n1 and the grassmann manifold

gn,m (c). although these cases are known, it is instructive to discuss them with

emphasis on the interpretation in terms of ng and qng boson.

in sec. 3, we

1 symmetric spaces are homogeneous spaces g/h with an involutive automorphism. since it

can be shown that any dierential form  in a symmetric space is closed, d = 0, a fundamental

two form of a hermitian symmetric space is also closed and then is kahlerian. hence, a term

kahler symmetric space has the same meaning.

2 we use dimc for complex dimensions and dim for real dimensions.

first three manifolds, cp n 1, gn,m (c) and qn 2(c) are called a projective space, a grassmann

manifold and a quadratic surface respectively. the projective space cp n 1 and the grassmann

manifold gn,m (c) are a set of complex lines and m dimensional complex planes in cn respec-

tively. bi(di) corresponds to odd(even) n .

in the mathematical literature, eiii is written as

e6/spin(10)  u (1), since coset generators belong to the so(10) weyl spinor.

generalize to other hermitian symmetric spaces, by introducing f-term constraints

in addition to d-term constraints. results in this section are new. as a by-product,

we nd explicit expressions of holomorphic constraints to embed g/h to cp n or

gn,m (c). sec. 4 is devoted to conclusions and discussions. we discuss how the

results can be generalized to an arbitrary kahler g/h manifold. in appendix a,

we review the construction of the kahler potentials for kahler g/h by bkmu and

ikk methods, in the case of the hermitian symmetric spaces. in appendix b, we

review the theorem of lerche and shore. appendix c, d and e are devoted to

summaries of so, e6 and e7 algebras.

in the rest of this section, we summarize notations and terminology used in this

paper.

the linear description of nonlinear sigma model without a gauge symmetry is

given by

l = z d4 +(cid:18)z d20g() + c.c.(cid:19) ,

(1.1)

where chiral supereld  belongs to an irreducible representation of the global sym-

metry group g and 0 is an auxiliary chiral supereld. the absence of kinetic term

of 0 corresponds to the strong coupling limit of the yukawa theory. although the

superpotential w = 0g() is g-invariant, 0 and g() need not be g-invariant sep-

arately. instead, they may have indices transforming as a non-trivial representation
of g, such as w = 0ig()i. if we integrate over the auxiliary eld 0, we obtain f-
term constraints, g() = 0, which are holomorphic functions. therefore, the f-term

constraints are invariant under the larger group gc, the complex extension of g .

let the number of f-term constraints be nf. if it is large enough, the target
manifold m becomes a gc-orbit of the vacuum v =<  >. let the complex isotropy
group of the vacuum be h ( hv = v). then, the target manifold of the nonlinear

sigma model is parameterized by the chiral superelds corresponding to complex
broken generators in gc  h.3 therefore m is a complex coset space, m  gc/ h
generated by these broken generators. as an example, let us consider a doublet
 =   1
2! of g = su(2), and suppose that they acquire vacuum expectation
values v =   1
0 0! satises
+v = 0, it is the complex unbroken generator in h. on the other hand, 3 and the
lowering operator (= +) are the elements of the broken generators in gc  h.
there are two kinds of broken generators: hermitian broken generator x and

0!. since the raising operator + = 1

2(1 + i2) =   0 1

non-hermitian broken generator e.4 supereld corresponding to non-hermitian and

hermitian generators are called the pure-type and mixed-type superelds, respec-
tively [5, 6]. in the previous example where the representative of gc/ h is given by
 = exp i(33 + )v, 3 is the mixed-type and  is the pure-type supereld. the
scalar components of the mixed-type multiplets consist of a qng boson in addition

to a ng boson, whereas those of the pure-type multiplets consist of two genuine ng
bosons. since the vacuum is invariant under h, we can multiply arbitrary element
of h to the representative of the coset manifold from the right.

in our previous

3 we use the calligraphy for a lie algebra corresponding to a lie group.
4 in general, h is larger than h c by the existence of non-hermitian generators e. e is hermitian

conjugate of e. they constitute so-called borel subalgebra b in h [5].

4

example, we can rewrite it as exp i(33 + 1 + 2)  v by multiplying appro-
priate factor generated by + for suciently small |3| and ||. the ng-bosons
parameterizing s3  su(2) are 3, ,  , whereas 3 is the qng-boson
parameterizing the radius of s3. the number of chiral superelds parameterizing

the target manifold is

n = dimc v  nf = nm + np,

(1.2)

where v is the representation space. numbers of the mixed-type and pure-type

multiplets are denoted by nm and np respectively.

the directions parameterized by qng bosons are non-compact, whereas those of

ng bosons are compact.5 from the theorem of lerche and shore (see appendix b),

there exist at least one mixed-type multiplet, and therefore the target manifold m

becomes non-compact. since any two points in the non-compact direction cannot

be connected by the compact isometry group g, m is also non-homogeneous.

as a notation, we rewrite the groups g and h dened above as g and h,
and therefore m  gc/ h. in order to eliminate the degree of freedom of qng
bosons, we elevate the subgroup of g to a local gauge symmetry. we assume g

is a direct product of a global symmetry and the gauge symmetry ggauge, namely,
g = g  ggauge, where ggauge = u(1) or u(n). the gauged linear lagrangian can
be written as

l = z d4(cid:16)ev   cv(cid:17) +(cid:18)z d20g() + c.c.(cid:19) ,

(1.3)

where 0 and v are auxiliary chiral and vector superelds. absence of the kinetic

term of gauge eld corresponds to the strong coupling limit where gauge coupling

constant tends to innity. here, for simplicity, the gauge group is assumed to be

u(1). see sec. 2.2 for a non-abelian case. integration over 0 gives f-term constraint
to dene the non-compact manifold m as discussed before. the integration over v
gives a d-term constraint that restrict to the compact manifold m = m/gc

gauge [21],

whose dimension is

(1.4)
5 we use the word compactness in the sense of topology. the kinetic terms of qng bosons

dimc m = n  dim ggauge.

have the same sign with those of ng bosons.

5

since we introduce gauge elds to absorb all mixed type multiplets,6 the dimension

of the gauge group and the compact manifold m are

dim ggauge = nm,

dimc m = np.

(1.5)

the compact manifold m is parameterized by only pure-type multiplets.

2 nonlinear sigma models without f-term con-

straint

although examples in this section are well known[21], we describe them in detail,

since the interpretation in terms of ng and qng bosons is useful to nd the non-

linear sigma models on other compact manifolds.

2.1 projective space: cp n1 = su (n )/s(u (n  1)  u (1))
def= g u(1)d. later,
we consider a global symmetry g = u(n) = su(n) u(1)d
the phase symmetry u(1)d will be gauged while g = su(n) remains to be global.
we prepare the fundamental elds ~  n, which will acquire a vacuum expectation
value. first of all, we consider a canonical kahler potential,

k(~, ~ ) = ~ ~.

(2.1)

for later purposes, we decompose g = su(n) under a subgroup su(n  1) u(1).
a fundamental representation n is decomposed as n = (n  1, 1)  (1,n + 1),
where the second factors are u(1) charges. hence, we decompose the elds as
~ =   x
yi! (i = 1,   , n  1). generators of su(n) can also be decomposed
to su(n  1) generators ta (a = 1,   , n 2  2n), u(1) generator t , n  1
raising operators ei represented by upper triangle matrices and lowering operators

6 supersymmetric higgs mechanism occurs as follows: a vector supereld absorbs one mixed-

type multiplet to constitute a massive vector multiplet. if it absorbs a pure-type multiplet, one

ng boson remains massless, they can not constitute massive vector multiplet, and supersymemtry

is spontaneously broken [31].

(2.2)

where (ta) is a n1 by n1 matrix for fundamental representation of su(n1).
2 = tr t 2 = tr eiei = 2 (no sum). when
we normalized these generators as tr ta
 =  and , a  r, this transformation law reduces to that of the real group
su(n). the u(1)d transformation is generated by td = 1n .

when ~ acquire a vacuum expectation value, it can be transformed by gc to

the standard form,

~v = d~e =   1
0! .

(2.3)

by this vacuum, the global symmetry is spontaneously broken down as u(n) 
u(n1) = su(n1)u(1) def= h. here, u(1) is generated by t   diag(0, 1,   , 1),
which is a linear combination of td and t . the complex isotropy group h, which
leaves ~v invariant, is larger than hc since upper triangle generators ei annihilate
the vacuum ~v. here, ei generators constitute a borel subalgebra b in h. on the
other hand, the complex broken generators are lower triangle generators ei and a
diagonal generator x = (1, 0,   , 0), which is also a linear combination of t and
td. the non-hermitian generators ei are pure-type generators and the hermitian
generator x is a mixed-type generator. the target manifold m of nonlinear sigma
model is a complex coset manifold m  gc/ h generated by these complex broken
generators. since, by using its representative  = exp(i ei + ix), the elds can
be written as ~ = ~v, its form near the vacuum is

~v = (ix + i ei)~v =   i
i! .

(2.4)

we, thus, nd that  is a mixed-type chiral supereld, whose scalar components

are ng and qng bosons, while i are pure-type chiral superelds, whose scalar

components are both ng bosons. then the numbers of mixed-type and pure-type

7

chiral superelds are nm = 1 and np = n  1 respectively. this kahler manifold
is non-compact and non-homogeneous due to the existence of the qng boson.

to construct a compact homogeneous manifold, we want to eliminate the qng

boson (the mixed-type multiplet). hence, we gauge u(1)d symmetry by introducing

a vector supereld v , which will absorb the mixed-type multiplet. the gauged

kahler potential is [31]

k(~, ~ , v ) = ev ~ ~  cv,

(2.5)

where cv is a fayet-iliopoulos(fi) d-term [21, 31]. since the transformation law of

v is

ev  ev 

= ev ei(),

ei  u(1)d,

(2.6)

where  is a chiral supereld, the kahler potential (2.5) is invariant under the
c. note that the global symmetry

complex extension of the gauge symmetry, u(1)d

g = su(n) cannot be complexied. the equation of motion of v is

k/v = ev ~ ~  c = 0.

from this equation, v can be solved as

v (~, ~ ) =  log


~ ~

c 
 .

to eliminate the gauge eld, we substitute v (~, ~ ) back to eq. (2.5):

k(~, ~ , v (~, ~ )) = c log(~ ~),

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

where we have omitted constant terms.7 since we have the gauge symmetry u(1)d

c,

we can x the gauge as

~ =   1

i! .

(2.10)

7their contributions to the lagrangian vanishes because of d4 integration.

8

by comparing eq. (2.4) and eq. (2.10), we nd that the mixed-type chiral super-

eld has been eliminated by this gauge xing. the gauge xed eld (2.10) can be

rewritten as

~ = ~v,

 = e e =   1

0

i 1n1!

(2.11)

where  can be considered as a representative of a complex coset manifold gc/ h 
g/h = su(n)/s(u(n  1)  u(1)). since this is a compact homogeneous kahler
manifold, we have obtained a desired result. to obtain a compact manifold, gauge

elds were necessary. by substituting eq. (2.10) to eq. (2.9), we obtain

k(, , v (, )) = c log(1 + ||2).

(2.12)

this is the well known kahler potential of the fubini-study metric for cp n1 =
su(n)/s(u(n  1)  u(1)).

2.2 grassmann manifold: gn,m (c) = u (n )/u (n  m) u (m)

this subsection is a generalization of the last subsection. the picture of ng and

qng bosons was discussed in ref. [22]. we consider a global symmetry g =
gl  gr = u(n)l  u(m)r (n > m). the basic elds are   (n, m), which are
n  m matrix valued chiral superelds. the transformation law of  under gc is8
(2.13)

   = g   def= glgr1,

g = (gl, gr)  gc
where gl and gr are n  n and m  m matrices, respectively.

the kahler potential is the canonical one:

k(, ) = tr ().

any vacuum can be transformed under gc to

v = hi =   1m

0 ! ,

(2.14)

(2.15)

8 the conjugate representation ~  n is dened to transform ~  (g1)t ~, since the group is

extended to its complexication and we should preserve the chirality.

where 1m is the m  m identity matrix and 0 is a (n  m)  m zero matrix.
the global symmetry is spontaneously broken as u(n)l  u(m)r  u(n  m)l 
u(m)v. here, u(n  m)l is the group generated by    0m 0
t ! , 0m!  (gl,gr),
where t are (n  m) (n  m) matrices, and u(m)v is by    t
0 0nm ! , t! 
(gl,gr) where t are m  m matrices. the complex isotropy h that leaves hi in-
variant is larger than hc by e def=    0m
0nm ! , 0m!, where t are m(nm)
matrices. here, e constitute a borel subalgebra b of h and its dimension is
dimc b = m(n  m). on the other hand, the complex broken generators con-
sist of non-hermitian generators, e def=    0m
0nm ! , 0m!, which are hermitian
conjugates of e, and hermitian generators, x def=    t
0 0nm ! ,t!, which are
elements of an axial symmetry u(m)a. the target manifold is a complex coset
manifold m  gc/ h and its representative is  = exp( e + i x) def= (l, r).
the eld can be written as ~ =   v = lv r1. its form near the vacuum is

(2.16)

here,  is m  m matrix chiral supereld considered as mixed types and  is
(n  m) m matrix chiral supereld considered as pure types. hence, the number
of the mixed-type and pure-type chiral superelds are nm = m 2 and np = m(n 
m)(= dimc b) respectively.

to absorb m 2 mixed-type chiral superelds, we gauge u(m)r by introducing
m 2 vector superelds v = v ata, where ta are generators of u(m)r. the gauged

kahler potential is

k(, , v ) = tr (ev )  c tr v,

(2.17)

where c tr v is a fayet-iliopoulos d-term. since the vector superelds are trans-

formed as

ev  ev 

= grev gr,

10

(2.18)

the gauged kahler potential is invariant under the complexied gauge symmetry

gr

c. to eliminate vector superelds, we use the equation of motion of v ,9

then v can be solved as

k/v = ev  c1m = 0.

v (, ) =  log  
c ! .

by substituting this to eq. (2.17), we obtain

(2.19)

(2.20)

k(, , v (, )) = c tr log() = c log det(),

(2.21)

where we have omitted constant terms. we choose a gauge xing as

 =   1m
 !

(2.22)

where  is a (n  m) m matrix valued chiral supereld. by comparing eq. (2.16)
and eq. (2.22), we nd that all mixed-type multiplets  have disappeared by this
gauge xing condition. when  is a representative of gc/ h = u(n)/u(n  m) 
u(m),  can be rewritten as

 =   v = lv r1,

 = e e =    1m



0

1nm ! , 1m! = (l, r).

(2.23)

since the target space m is parameterized solely by pure-type multiplets, it is a

compact homogeneous kahler manifold. by substituting eq. (2.22) to eq. (2.21),

we obtain the kahler potential of m

k(, , v (, )) = c log det(1m + ).

(2.24)

this is the kahler potential of grassmann manifold gn,m = u(n)/u(n  m) 
u(m) [3].

9 we treat ev ev as an innitesimal parameter, since tr (ev ) = tr (ev (ev ev )).

the second term is obtained from tr ( log x) = tr (x 1x), where x = ev .

3 nonlinear sigma models with f-term constraints

only d-term constraints appeared in the last two examples. in this section we also

introduce appropriate f-term constraints to dene other kahlerian g/h manifolds.

3.1 so(n )/so(n  2)  u (1)
we consider a global symmetry, g = so(n)  u(1)d = g  u(1)d. we will
gauge u(1)d symmetry later. the elds, which will develop a vacuum expectation
value, are ~ in the dening representation n of so(n). the u(1)d charge of ~ is
dened to be 1. the fundamental representation is decomposed under its subgroup
so(n  2)  u(1) as n = (n  2, 0)  (1, 1)  (1,1). here, the second factor is
the u(1) charge. the elds can be written as

~ = 


x

yi

z




,

(3.1)

where x, yi (i = 1,   , n  2) and z are a scalar, a vector and a scalar of so(n  2)
respectively, and their u(1) charge are dened above. so(n) is dened as the group

that leaves the following quadratic form

i2

def= ~ 2 def= ~ t j ~ = 2xz + y2,

where we have written the invariant tensor of rank 2 in a rather unconventional way

(see appendix c)

j =

(3.3)

the generators of so(n) consist of so(n  2) generator tij (i, j = 1,   , n 
2), u(1) generator t , and upper triangle matrices ei (i = 1,   , n  2) which
transform as (n  2, 1), and their complex conjugates ei = (ei) in (n  2,1).
the so(n)c acts on the fundamental representation in our basis as

j = ij. here, these coecients are normalized by tr t 2

where i
ij = tr t 2 =
tr ei ei = 2 (no sum). all parameters are complex when we consider so(n)c and
real when so(n).

in order to impose the global symmetry so(n)  u(1)d, we introduce a super-

potential

w (0, ~) = 0~ 2,

(3.5)

with a lagrange multiplier eld 0, which is so(n) singlet and its u(1)d charge
is dened to be 2 so that w is invariant under g. since the superpotential is a
holomorphic function of  and 0, the symmetry is enhanced to its complexcation
c. we can eliminate the auxiliary eld by using its equation
gc = so(n)cu(1)d
of motion 10

w/0 = i2 = 2xz + y2 = 0.

(3.6)

we, thus, obtain a f-term constraint (nf = 1). this equation is immediately solved

as

then, the eld ~ constrained by f-term is written as

z =

when this develop a vacuum expectation value, any vacuum can be transformed by
gc to the standard form,

~v = d~e =   1
0! .

(3.9)

0 + ~  ~, and
|~ 2|2 + |0|2|~|2. we obtain the f-term constraint in

w = 0 ~ 2, then the potential reads v = 1
the limit   0.

13

by this vacuum expectation value, the global symmetry is spontaneously broken as
so(n)u(1)d  so(n2)u(1), where unbroken u(1) is generated by a linear
combination of u(1) subgroup and u(1)d.11 the complex broken generators consist
of x, which is hermitian and generates a mixed-type multiplet, and ei, which are

non-hermitian and generate pure-type multiplets. then, the number of the mixed-
and pure-type multiplets are nm = 1 and np = n  2 respectively. the target
manifold m generated by these generators is a non-compact and non-homogeneous

due to presence of the qng boson. the eld near ~v is

~v = (ix + i ei)~v = 


i

,




(3.10)

where  is a mixed-type multiplet and i are pure-type multiplets.

we elevate u(1)d to a local gauge symmetry to obtain a compact manifold by

i2 = f 2 6= 0, we have to use w = g0(i2  f 2), then there is no u (1)d symmetry, and there
is a supersymmetric vacuum alignment [9, 10]. namely, the unbroken global symmetry h can
be dierent depending on the choice of the vacuum expectation value: h = so(n  1) at the
symmetric points, where  = f 2, and h = so(n  2) at the non-symmetric points, where
 > f 2. whereas i2 = 0 corresponds to an open orbit, i2 6= 0 correspond to closed orbits. in
general, in closed orbits, there is a supersymmetric vacuum alignment. see e.g. subsec. 3.3 for the

e6 case. in this paper, we do not discuss closed orbits, since we can not gauge u (1)d symmetry.

instead, we could impose the d-term constraint

3.2 so(2n )/u (n ) and sp(n )/u (n )

in this subsection, we consider the global symmetry g = gl  gr, where gl is
either so(2n) or sp(n) and gr = u(n)r, which will be gauged later. to embed
gl to 2n2n matrix of u(2n), we write its elements by using four nn matrices,

g =   a b

c d!  u(2n).

we consider the global symmetry either g = so(2n)l  u(n)r for  = +1 or
g = sp(n)l  u(n)r for  = 1. the eld contents are   (2n, n), which will
acquire a vacuum expectation value. its transformation law under g is

   = g   = glgr1,

g = (gl, gr)  gl  gr

(3.18)

the gc invariant superpotential is

w (0, ) = tr (0t j),

(3.19)

where 0 is an n  n auxiliary matrix chiral supereld, whose transformation law
is

since i2 def= t j is symmetric (anti-symmetric) for  = 1( = 1), 0 satises

t = 0.

(3.21)

namely, 0 belongs to a symmetric (anti-symmetric) rank-2 tensor representation
of su(n)r for  = 1( = 1), and its u(1)d( u(n)r) charge is dened to be 2
to cancel with the  charge. note that i2 = t j is invariant under gl, but not
invariant under gr

to eliminate the auxiliary eld 0, we calculate its equation of motion:

w/0 = t j = 0.

(3.22)

we, thus, obtained f-term constraints for the elds . their number is nf =
2n(n + 1) for  = 1 and nf = 1

2n(n  1) for  = 1. then the dimension of
the resulting manifold m constrained by the f-term is n = 2n 2  1
2n(n + 1) =

the eld  acquires a vacuum expectation value, any vacuum can be transformed

of the global symmetry is either so(2n)lu(n)r  u(n)v for  = 1 or sp(n)l

vector superelds as in the grassmann manifold. the gauged kahler potential

is the same as eq. (2.17), but with f-term constraints. since the procedure of

integrating out the gauge elds are also the same as the grassmann manifold, we

obtain eq. (2.21). we can choose the gauge xing as

they are anti-symmetric (symmetric) parts of the matrix chiral supereld of the
grassmann manifold g2n,n for  = +1 (1). their dimensions are dimc m =
2n(n  1) for  = +1 and dimc m = 1
2n(n + 1) for  = 1. again, it is a well-
known that these manifold are submanifolds of the grassmann manifold g2n,n in

3.3 e6/so(10)  u (1)

this and the next subsections are devoted to the gauge theory construction of the

exceptional-type hermitian symmetric spaces. the situation is slightly dierent from

the classical group cases. namely, a f-term constrained manifold m is characterized

by the derivative of a g-invariant, i = 0, but not the g-invariant itself, i = 0, as

in the case of classical-types.

as in the qn2(c) case, we consider a global symmetry g = e6  u(1)d =
g  u(1)d. the eld belongs to the fundamental representation of e6: ~  27,
which will acquire a vacuum expectation value. we decompose e6 under its maximal
subgroup so(10) u(1). since the fundamental representation can be decomposed
as 27 = (1, 4)  (16, 1)  (10,2) [27] where the second factors are u(1) charge,
the basic eld ~ can be written as

here, x, y ( = 1,   , 16) and za (a = 1,   , 10) are a so(10) scalar, a weyl

78 = (45, 0)  (1, 0)  (16, 1)  ( 16,1) [27], implies that e6 algebra can be con-
structed by so(10) generators tab (a, b = 1,   , 10), a u(1) generator t , upper
half generators e, which belong to a weyl spinor of so(10), and their conjugates

that these equations can be written also as

10 equations are independent: the rst equation can be solved

(ca)(ca).

(3.42)

n = 27  10 = 17. the manifold m satisfying these f-term constraints can be
written as

nm = 1 respectively. the target manifold m generated by these broken genera-
tors has dimension dim m = n = 17. since it coincide with the dimension of

the manifold constrained by 10 independent f-term conditions, any vacuum which
satises f-term constraints can be transformed to the form of eq. (3.45) by a gc

transformation.

to remove the mixed-type multiplet and to obtain a compact manifold, we gauge
u(1)d symmetry as the case of the cp n1. the gauged kahler potential is the same

potential of e6/so(10)u(1) constructed in refs. [24, 15, 23]. (it is also equivalent
to [14].) its dimension is dimc m = 27  10  1 = 16. if we do not introduce the
superpotential, the manifold is cp 26. hence, e6/so(10)  u(1) is embedded in
cp 26 by 10 f-term constraints, i3 = 0. in fact, yasui constructed e6/so(10) 
u(1) as a submanifold of cp 26 by using the jordan algebra[16].

(3.60)

we can show that these equations are not independent of eqs. (3.59) by the help of

the springer relation, eq. (d.6). then the number of f-term constraints is nf = 28,

i4 = 0.

by using gc, any vacuum expectation value of ~ can be transformed to

0! .

(3.63)

on this vacuum, global symmetry is spontaneously broken as e7  u(1)d  e6 
u(1) def= h. here u(1) is generated by a linear combination of u(1) generator t and
u(1)d generator td = 156. from eq. (3.50), the complex isotropy h is larger than
hc by ei, which constitutes a borel subalgebra. the complex broken generators
are an hermitian generator x, which is a linear combination of td and t , and non-
hermitian generators ei. hence, the numbers of mixed- and pure-type multiplets
are nm = 1 and np = 27 respectively. the target manifold m is generated by
these broken generators and its dimension is dimc m = 28, which coincides with

the dimension of the manifold constrained by the f-term conditions in eq. (3.61).

the target manifold m obtained above is non-compact due to the qng boson.

we gauge u(1)d symmetry to remove the mixed-type multiplet and to obtain a
compact manifold. since the situation is the same as the cp n1, qn2(c) and
e6/so(10)u(1) cases, by integrating out the vector supereld, we obtain eq. (2.9).
we can choose a gauge xing as

this form coincides with ref. [13]. its dimension is dimc m = 56  28  1 = 27. it
can be embedded to cp 55 by holomorphic constraints i4 = 0.

4 conclusions and discussions

we have obtained nonlinear sigma models, whose target manifolds are the her-

mitian symmetric spaces g/h, which are compact and homogeneous, from lin-

ear models. for this purpose, we introduced appropriate superpotentials for g =

so, su, sp, e6, e7 to impose f-term constraints. by solving these f-term constraint
equations, we have obtained constrained manifolds m, which are non-compact and

non-homogeneous due to the existence of qng bosons. when there is no gauge

symmetry, there must be at least one qng boson by the theorem of lerche and

shore [6], and the manifold inevitably becomes non-compact and non-homogeneous

(see appendix b). in order to get rid of these unwanted qng-bosons, we further

introduced suitable local gauge symmetry. by choosing suitable gauge conditions,

we obtained the kahler potentials of all the hermitian symmetric spaces, where de-

cay constants (overall constants of kahler potentials) are originated from fi-terms

of gauge elds.

the gauging procedures to eliminate qng bosons can be summarized as fol-

15 by using the result in ref. [9], in all cases considered in this paper, there exists no supersym-

metric vacuum alignment, since there is no non-singlet broken generators under the real unbroken
subgroup h. hence, the f-term constrained manifolds m   gc/ h  are topologically isomorphic
to direct products of a qng boson factor r+ = {|  r,  > 0}, which is non-compact, and
a ng bosons factor g/h , which is compact. for example, in the case of cn without f-term
constraint, m   gc/ h  = (su(n )u(1)d)c
gauging u (1), we obtained gc/ h  g/h = cp n 1.

gauge. all m are compact and homogeneous, since they are
in the cases of cp n1 and gn,m , there are
no f-term constraints. other cases have gc-invariants, superpotentials and f-term

parameterized by only ng bosons.

constraints as summarized in table 2.

the f-term constraints can be classied into two types:

 g = so, sp: i = 0. they are gc-invariants.
 g = e6, e7: i = 0. although i are not gc-invariant, those constraints

themselves are gc-invariant.

in each case, the value of gc-invariant vanishes on the constrained manifolds, since,

even in the case of exceptional cases, the constraints i = 0 lead to i = 0. this

remarkable fact can be understood as follows: note that, in each case, gc-invariant

i is not invariant under a gauge group. hence, it must vanish to be consistent with

a gauge symmetry. we call it the consistency condition with a gauge symmetry.16

16 by combining the result in ref. [10], this condition can be understood as the condition that

the the manifold before gauging must be an open orbit but not a closed orbit. in ref. [10], it was

here, j, j ,  and d are rank-2, rank-2, rank-3 and rank-4 invariant symmetric tensors of so(n ),

, i3 and i4 are gc-invariants composed of

them. each superpotential gives a f-term constraint, which is i = 0 in the case of classical groups

or i = 0 in the case of exceptional groups. only 10 equations in the 27 equations are independent

in the e6 case, and only 28 equations among 56 equations are independent in the e7 case. the

last column denotes the projective or grassmann manifold, to which each hermitian symmetric

space is embedded by the f-term constraint.

if we forget the f-term constraints and impose only the d-term constraints, the
manifolds become cp n1 or g2n,n . this means that all of the hermitian symmetric
spaces are holomorphically embedded to cp n1 or gn,m by f-term constraints, as

is shown in the last column of table 2. although, some constraints are known

in the mathematical literature, the explicit form of constraints in the e6 and e7
cases are new results: e6/so(10) u(1) is holomorphically embbedded to cp 26 by
16 quadratic homogeneous constraints, and e7/e6  u(1) to cp 55 by 28 tripletic
homogeneous constraints. the consistency condition with a gauge symmetry can be

understood if we interpret the f-term constraints as the embedding conditions. since

the gn,m can be embedded to cp n , all hermitian symmetric spaces are embedded
to cp n . if we want to embed m to cp n , the constraint must be homogeneous,

when it is written in terms of homogeneous coordinates.17

shown that the open orbit includes a compact and homogeneous manifold as a submanifold, on

the other hand, the closed orbit does not have it.

17 the manifold, which can be embedded to cp n , is a (projective) algebraic variety and can be

understood as a hodge manifold.

28

in this paper, we used the equation of motion for the vector auxiliary eld. in

path integral formalism, this procedure corresponds to integrating over the vector

eld. in a separate paper [26], we show that the path integration can be performed

exactly.

now we discuss possible generalizations of our result to wider class of kahlerian

g/h. in this paper, we treated the hermitian symmetric spaces, which are a special

class of homogeneous kahler manifolds. we conned ourselves to the gauge groups

of u(1) or u(n).

1. even within this limitation, it is possible to generalize our construction to

wider class of homogeneous kahler manifolds. let us consider kahler g/h
where h have only one u(1) factor, h = hssu(1) with hss being semisimple
subgroup of h. to be specic, let us generalize so(2n)/u(n). by general-
izing  to 2n  m matrix (n  m) transforming under so(2n)  u(m) as
  glgr1, with the same superpotential (3.19), where j is the same as
eq. (3.16), we obtain

(r+)m 2



so(2n)l  u(m)r

so(2n  2m)l  u(m)v

u (m )r

so(2n)l

so(2n  2m)l  u(m)l

.

this reduces to so(2n)/so(2n2)u(1) when m = 1 and to so(2n)/u(n)
when n = m. similarly, sp(n)/u(n) can also be generalized. by generaliz-
ing  to 2n  m matrix (n  m), we obtain
u (m )r

sp(n)l  u(m)r

sp(n)l

(r+)m 2



sp(n  m)l  u(m)v

sp(n  m)l  u(m)l

.

2. generalization to many u(1) factors. remember that the fi parameter c

becomes a decay constant, which represents the size of g/h, after integrating

out the vector supereld. then, we can consider that there is a one to one
correspondence: the decay constants  fi-parameters. hence, to obtain g/h
with h = hss  u(1)n we must prepare n fi-parameters. we, thus, consider a
global symmetry, g = gg1   gn, where each gi includes a u(1) factor. if
we gauge all gi, the gauged kahler potential has n fi terms. after integrating
out vector superelds, we will obtain g/h  g1     gn = g/hss  u(1)n,

29

where h is the remaining part after embedding all gi to g. here we have
put hss = h  g1ss    gnss. in the case of the hermitian symmetric spaces,
we introduced an irreducible representation of g as basic eld. it seems that

we have to introduce more irreducible representations in these generalizations.

then we have to impose orthogonality relations of these elds by d-term or

f-term constraints. at moment, we are unable to nd consistent constraints

in these cases.

a bkmu-ikk construction of kahler potentials

of compact homogeneous kahler manifolds

bando et.al. gave the general method to construct g invariant kahler potential of
gc/ h [5]. however, there remained an ambiguity to choose the projection operators

i introduced below, eq. (a.1). itoh et.al. constructed them explicitly when the
target is compact, namely gc/ h  g/h [11]. note that their method does not
ensure that such models can be obtained from linear models. in this appendix, we

review their method to compare with our method, which, on the other hand, gives

a linear origin.

first of all, we need the projection matrices, which project a fundamental rep-
resentation space onto a h invariant subspace [5]. they satisfy the projection con-

ditions,

 = ,

 h = h,

2 = .

(a.1)

in the arbitrary kahler g/h, there exist projection matrices as many as the u(1)

factors in h. since there is only one u(1) factor in the hermitian symmetric cases,

30

there is one projection matrix. in each case, it can be written as [11]

 =   1

0! .

(a.2)

by using this, the kahler potentials of compact kahler manifolds can be written

as [5]

k = c log det,

(a.3)

where  is a representative of the complex coset gc/ h. since the form of  can

be calculated as eqs. (2.11), (2.23), (3.12), (3.29), (3.47) and (3.65), they give the

same kahler potential obtained from linear models in this paper.

b the non-compactness theorem of lerche and

shore

the nonlinear sigma model, whose target manifold is compact and homogeneous,

has the unique kahler potential as discussed in the last appendix [5, 11]. although

these models do not include neither any qng boson nor an arbitrariness in the

kahler potential and they are mathematically beautiful, they can not be obtained

from any linear model at least when there is no gauge symmetry: it was shown that

there exist at least one qng boson and therefore the target must be non-compact

and non-homogeneous. in this appendix, we review the theorem obtained by lerche

and shore [6]. (see also refs. [7].)

the linear model origin means that the target manifold can be obtained from

some f-term conditions (if there is no gauge symmetry). since they are holomorphic

equations, the invariance under the global symmetry g enlarges to the complexica-

tion gc, and the manifold becomes gc-orbit of the vacuum expectation value v.18

the pure type multiplets require that the real broken generators must be divided
to complex unbroken and complex broken generators, ei and ei(= (ei)). since ei
18 if there are not enough f-term constraints, the manifold may become larger than gc-orbit.

however, the proof is valid also in such cases, since they includes at least one gc-orbit.

is broken, we obtain

0 6= | eiv|2 = vhei, eii v = (i)avhav,

(b.1)

where (i)a is a root vector and ha is a cartan generator. therefore, at least one

cartan generator, ha, must be broken. since it is hermitian, there exists at least

one mixed-type generator, and therefore at least one qng boson.

c so(n ) algebra

since the basis of so(n) used in subsec. 3.1 are not the standard form, we give a

relation to the ordinary basis. the so(n) generators in ordinary basis are

(tij)k

l =

(k

in the basis, the vacuum expectation value satisfying ~v 2 = 0 can be written as

~v =

the real unbroken generators, at the center of the matrix, generate so(n  2). the
complex unbroken and broken generators are

by an unitary transformation by

u =

.




(c.5)

since u is an unitary matrix, uu = uu = 1, ~ ~ is invariant, and then log(~ ~).

by the unitary transformation, the vacuum expectation value is transformed to the

standard form,

u~v =   1

0! .

(c.6)

the so(n  2) generators are not transformed and the other generators are trans-
formed as

(c.7)

we, thus, obtain the transformation law (3.4) used in subsec. 3.1. moreover, the
second rank invariant tensor is transformed as ij  (uu t )ij = jij, where j is
dened in eq, (3.3).

d e6 algebra

in this appendix, we collect the e6 algebra by referring refs. [15, 28].

33

d.1 construction of e6 algebra

since an adjoint representation is decomposed as 78 = (45, 0)  (1, 0)  (16, 1) 
( 16,1) [27], we construct the e6 algebra as e6 = so(10)  u(1)  16  16: we
prepare so(10) generator tab, u(1) generator t , 16 as e and 16 as e = (e).
then their commutation relations can be calculated as follows [15, 28]:

[tab, tcd] = i(bctad + adtbc  actbd  bdtac),
[tab, e] = (ab)
[t, e] =

e,

[e, e] = [ e, e] = 0,

(d.1)

the u(1) charge of e is determined by the dierence of u(1) charges of x and y

or y and z in eq. (3.32):

the last equation is the same value as u(1) charge of e from the anti-symmetric

property of the structure constants. the relative weight of the rst and the second
term is determined by using the jacobi identity, [ e, [e, e]] + (cyclic) = 0, and the

nontrivial identity for the spinor generators [15, 28],

invariant tensor of e6

by a tensor product [27], 27  27 = 27s    , there exist rank-3 symmetric tensor
invariant under e6. the components of ijk are [28]

0ab = ab
a = 12(ca)
otherwise 0

.

(d.3)

ijk = 


these components can be calculated as follows. first of all, construct the so(10)
u(1) invariant of order three:

i3 = axz2 +

1
2

zay(ca)y.

(d.4)

34

by the requirement of invariance of e or e, we can conclude a = 1. here we have

used the identity (3.42). the components (d.3) can be read from this invariant.

it is known that there is an identity [29] 19

ijkijl = 10l
i.

under the normalization in eq. (d.5), there is the springer relation [29]

ijk(jl{mno}k) = i{lmno},

(d.5)

(d.6)

where we have used a notation a{ij} = aij + aji +  . these identities are used
many times in the analysis of e7 algebra.

e e7 algebra

in this appendix, we construct the e7 algebra by the same way in the last appendix.

e.1 construction of e7 algebra

the decomposition of the adjoint representation of e7 under a maximal subgroup
e6u(1) is 133 = (78, 0)(1, 0)(27, 1)( 27,1), where second components are
u(1) charge [27]. hence, we can construct e7 algebra by adding generators ei and
ei(= (ei)) (i = 1,   , 27), which belong to e6 fundamental and anti-fundamental
representations respectively, to the e6  u(1) algebra, ta (a = 1,   , 78) and t :
e7 = e6  u(1)  27  27. by the same manner as we have constructed e6 algebra
in the last appendix, their commutation relations are obtained as follows:

[ta, tb] = ifab

ctc,

[ta, ei] = (ta)i

jej,

ei,

[t, ei] = s2
[ei, ej] = [ ei, ej] = 0,

[t, ta] = 0
[ta, ei] = (ta)t
[t, ei] = s 2

jta +s 2

[ei, ej] = (ta)i

jt.

(e.1)

19 in the calculation of ijaijb = 10ab, we have used the identity 24tr (ca

bc) =

ab [28].

35

here (ta) is a fundamental representation matrix and fab

c are structure constants

of e6, whose explicit forms have been obtained in the last section. the u(1) charge
in eq. (3.50) and ei as its
of ei is decided from the dierence of x and yi etc.
conjugate. in the last equation, the coecient of the second term coincides with

the u(1) charge of ei due to the anti-symmetricity of the structure constants of e7.
and the rst term has been decided by the jacobi identity, [ e, [e, e]] + (cyclic) = 0

and the nontrivial identity for the e6 fundamental representation [30],

a (ta)[i

j(ta)k]

l = 

2
3

[i

l.

(e.2)

this is satised under the notation tr (ta)2 = 6.

e.2

invariant tensors of e7

from the tensor product of fundamental representations [27], 56  56 = 1a    
and 56  56  56  56 = 1s    , there exist the rank-2 anti-symmetric tensor
f and the rank-4 symmetric tensor d as e7 invariant tensors. to nd their
components, we construct a linear combination of e6  u(1) invariants of quartic
order and require the invariance under e or e as the last appendix. the result is

i4 = d

(e.3)

here, i4 is invariant due to the springer relation for e6 invariant tensor, eq. (d.6).

the components can be read from this invariant. since we do not use the anti-

symmetric tensor f, we do not construct it.
