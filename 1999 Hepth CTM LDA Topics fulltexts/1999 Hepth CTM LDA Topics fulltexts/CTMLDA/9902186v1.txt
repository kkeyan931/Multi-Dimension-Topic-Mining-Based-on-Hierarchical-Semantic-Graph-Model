abstract: we continue the construction of non-trivial vacua for gauge theories on
the 3torus. application of constructions based on twist in su(n) with n > 2
produce more extra vacua in theories with exceptional groups. we calculate the
relevant unbroken subgroups, and their contribution to the witten index. we show
that the extra vacua we nd in the exceptional groups are sucient to solve the
witten index problem for these groups.

ha with ca

the vacuum equations for yang-mills theories on the 3torus with periodic boundary
conditions f = 0 always allow for the trivial solution a = ca
 a constant
and ha group generators in a maximal abelian algebra of the group (cartan sub-
algebra (csa)). for su(n) and sp(n)-theories, all solutions belong to the trivial
class, but for other gauge groups this is not the case. in [3, 4] it was shown that
other vacua, not belonging to the trivial class, exist for theories with g2 and so(n)
(n > 7) gauge group. in a previous article [5] we proposed a systematic approach
to constructing non-trivial vacua in gauge theories on the 3torus, and applied the
method to reproduce the results of [3, 4], and embed these results in the exceptional
groups f4 and e6,7,8. in this article we give the details for the extra vacua in theories
with exceptional groups, as was announced in [5] (see table 1 and 2).

the non-trivial vacua of a gauge theory on the 3torus are of relevance for the
problem of computing tr(1)f in supersymmetric gauge theories [1]. as tr(1)f is
an index, assuming no singularities as a function of the volume, this witten index
should be equal in the innite volume. in the innite volume the theory has a chiral
u(1) symmetry, broken to a discrete z2h symmetry by instantons, where h is the dual
coxeter number for the gauge group g. assuming gluino condensation, the symmetry
is broken to a z2, leaving h dierent vacua [1, 2]. in the nite volume version on
t 3  r, the moduli space of at connections might consist of several components. in
each component of the moduli space, the gauge group is partially broken. performing
a born-oppenheimer approximation each component of the moduli space, which
represents a particular class of solutions, contributes r + 1 to tr(1)f , where r is
the rank of the unbroken gauge group in the relevant component. equating tr(1)f
for the innite volume to the result for the nite volume one should nd [3]

h =xi

(ri + 1)

(1.1)

where the sum runs over disconnected components of moduli space, i.e. dierent
classes of solutions, and ri is the rank of the unbroken gauge group in each of these
components. this equality is satised for theories with su(n) and sp(n)-gauge
groups [1], where the moduli-space consists of only one component. for the theories
with so(n) groups a second component of the moduli-space was found in [3], and
for g2 the moduli space also consists of two components [4].
in both cases the
identity (1.1) is satised. for the remaining exceptional groups, a rst step towards
solving the problem was presented in [5], by showing that the results of [3, 4] can be
embedded in these exceptional groups.

note: after the publication of the rst part of this article [5] in which the results
of this paper were announced, another paper on the same subject appeared [10]. the
results in this paper agree with ours.

2. method of construction

we will shortly review our method.
instead of giving an explicit expression for
the gauge potential, we construct a set of commuting holonomies in a simply con-
nected representation of the gauge group g (in fact, since they commute in a simply-
connected representation of the gauge group, they will commute in any representa-
tion). a simple theorem [4] then guarantees a corresponding at connection. to
construct commuting elements of a given group, we study a p gn -subgroup, whose

universal covering gp gn is a product of n factors g. the global structure of p gn

is not that of a product group, since there is a diagonal central subgroup divided
out. this allows us to impose so-called multi-twisted boundary conditions [7]. as an
example we consider a subgroup p g2 (with universal covering g2). we assume that
g allows a non-trivial centre z, and that the global subgroup p g2 is a representa-
tion of ( g  g)/zdiag where zdiag = z is a diagonal subgroup of the centre z  z
of g2. we select two elements p1, q1 generated by the lie algebra of the rst g
factor ( g1), and two elements p2, q2 generated by the lie algebra of the second g
factor ( g2), such that they commute up to a non-trivial element of the centre z of
gi [6]:

p1q1 = z1q1p1
p2q2 = z2q2p2

(2.1)

(2.2)
since we only deal with representations of ( g  g)/zdiag, z1 and z2 are actually
elements of the central subgroup (z  z)/zdiag = z . by picking pi and qi in a
specic way, we can thus arrange that (2.1, 2.2) are satised with the additional
condition

we now construct the commuting elements

z1 = (z2)1  z

p = p1p2,

q = q1q2,

p  = qn

1 p qn
1

(2.3)

(2.4)

these elements will serve as candidate holonomies. to make sure that one nds a non-
trivial vacuum, one has to calculate the subgroup left unbroken by the holonomies,
and verify that its rank is lower than that of the original gauge group. for a more
thorough discussion, we refer the reader to [5], in that paper we discussed results

based on subgroups p gm with gp gm = su(2)m . we now proceed with results
based on subgroups p gm with gp gm = su(n)m , for n > 2.

3. representations of su (n > 2)m

before starting the discussion on explicit realisations of our construction we wish to
point out a few subtleties about these groups.

2

the groups su(n > 2) posses an outer automorphism that corresponds to com-
plex conjugation.
in other words, unlike the situation for su(2), an su(n > 2)
irreducible representation (irrep) is in general not equivalent to the complex con-
jugate of the irrep. the complex conjugated irrep has the same dimension as the
original irrep, and in the notation where each irrep is denoted by its dimension, say
n, the complex conjugate irrep is denoted by the dimension with a bar on top n. it
is a matter of convention which irrep is labelled as n and which as n. in the root
diagram of the corresponding algebra, this corresponds to an ambiguity in labelling
the roots. we will be interested in product groups, where one has this ambiguity in
every factor. the choice we will make to label the representations is related to the
following issue.

2 +    + t a

a diagonal subgroup of a group p gn can be constructed as follows: construct
a lie algebra l for g, consisting of elements t a. then the lie algebra for p gn has
the structure l1  l2      ln with each of the li = l. hence we can write t a
i ,
for the generator from li that corresponds to t a under an isomorphism mapping l
to li. the diagonal subgroup of p gn is then constructed by taking as generators
t a
1 + t a
n . this construction is not unique, there are many isomorphisms
from li to l, and these will give dierent diagonal subgroups. all these diagonal
subgroups have the same lie algebra, but they can have a dierent global structure.
as an example consider the su(3) su(3) irrep (3, 3), which in a dierent labelling
would be denoted as (3, 3). constructing the diagonal subgroup of (3, 3) as outlined
in the above, will lead to a tensor representation which decomposes into an 8 and a 1.
the diagonal subgroup of (3, 3) however is a tensor representation which decomposes
in a 6 and a 3. we will prefer the labelling (3, 3) since then the diagonal subgroup
(which is actually su(3)/z3) will have a trivial centre.

we construct our holonomies in subgroups that are not simply connected, re-
gardless of the representation of g we are working in. we need to verify case by
case that the holonomies that we construct commute in a simply connected repre-
sentation, implying that they commute in any representation of the gauge group
g.

for each algebra, there exists a set of fundamental weights i, dened by

2hi, ji
hj, ji

= ij

(3.1)

where the j are the simple roots of the algebra. i can be written as a linear
combination of simple roots with rational coecients. each weight is of the form

 =xi

(nii + mii) with ni, mi  z

(3.2)

when constructing a subalgebra lg of an algebra lg, one can arrange that the
csa of lg is contained in the csa of lg. call the generators of lg, h  and e .

3

then we have h  = h with h  lg. to nd the weights of the subgroup, we rst
nd the h associated to simple roots of g. these can be calculated using:

the weights  of g can now be found from the weights  of g with

h = h  = [e , e ]/2

(3.3)

(3.4)

h, i = h, i

 =xk

qkk

one way to nd out what the congruence class of the representation of g is, is by
expressing the weights  of the representation of g in the simple roots j of g. we
write

the qk are easily calculated using (3.1) with k a fundamental weight of g

2hk, i = qkhk, ki

(3.5)
in all cases we will be considering g = su(n), and hence hk, ki is a k-independent
number. since all weights can be obtained from one weight by adding (or subtracting)
simple roots, the fractional part of the qk is sucient to determine the weight lattice,
and thereby the congruence class of the representation.

we will now continue with the explicit constructions. our conventions are out-
lined in the appendices of [5]. for the decompositions of groups into subgroups, use
was made of [9].

4. non-trivial vacua based on twist in su (3)

we will start by developing the relevant tools for this group. after that we will give
an overview of groups in which our construction can be realised. these are all the
exceptional groups except g2. f4 will be discussed in quite some detail.

like in [5] where g = su(2) was discussed, our construction can always be
carried out in a subgroup su(3)2, but we will often take su(3)m with m > 2,
as this allows us to choose it to be a regular subgroup. this will give important
simplications in the calculations.

4.1 twist in su(3)

we will take the canonical form (in the conventions of the appendices of [5], with the
modication that we will use capital e and h to be able to distinguish the subgroup
generated by these from the original group, whose generators we keep on denoting
by h and e):

[h1, e1] = 1
3e1
[h2, e1] =  1
[e1, e1] = 2h1

[h1, e2] =  1
6 e1 [h2, e2] = 1
3e2
[e2, e2] = 2h2

6e1 [h1, e1+2] = 1
[h2, e1+2] = 1
[e1, e2] = 13
[e1+2, e12] = 2h1+2 = 2h1 + 2h2

6e1+2
6e1+2
e1+2

(4.1)

all other relations can be found by conjugation, and the jacobi identity.

in su(3) we look for two matrices satisfying

pq = exp(

2i
3

)qp

p and q will commute when lifted to su(3)/z3. we take:

p =


exp( 2i

0
0

3 ) 0
1
0 exp( 2i
3 )

0
0


 ,

q =


0 1 0
0 0 1
1 0 0




in terms of generators this is

p = exp (4ih1+2)

q = exp(cid:18) 4i

(e1 + e2 + e12  e1  e2  e1+2)(cid:19)

2i

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

the commutation relations of p and q with the group generators are most easily
calculated in a specic representation. one nds

(4.5)

ph = hp,
qh = hrq,
pe = exp(4ih, 1 + 2i)ep, qe = erq
 =

the action of the rotation r
(this is a genuine rotation over 2/3
in the root diagram) is fully deter-
mined by its action on the simple
roots. r is an element of the weyl
group: it is the composition of the
weyl reection generated by 2, fol-
lowed by the reection generated
by 1. the eect of r is

r :

1  2  (1 + 2)  1

(4.6)

a nice mnemonic for the action of r is provided by the extended dynkin di-
agram [8] of su(3). the extended dynkin diagram of an algebra consists of its
dynkin diagram, extended with one more root, h, with h the highest root of
the algebra. the dot representing the highest root is then connected to the diagram
via the standard rules. for su(3), h = (1 + 2) and the extended diagram con-
sists of 3 dots, connected to form a cycle. the action of r is nothing but a rotation
of this cycle by one step. for twist in the higher unitary groups we will see the same
feature: the action of the analogon of the element q can be represented by rotating
the (cyclic) extended dynkin diagram of the unitary group by one step.

4.2 calculation of the unbroken subgroup

again we wish to compute the combinations pt ap1 and qt aq1, with t a the gen-
erators of g. we will generalise our methods for the su(2)-case to su(3), but
this is complicated by a crucial dierence between su(2) and su(3): for su(2) all
weights in an irreducible representation have multiplicity 1, whereas this is not true
for su(3)-irreps. however, we will need only three irreps of su(3): the 1 and 10,
which do contain only simple weights, and the 8, which is equivalent to the adjoint.
note that these are all irreps of su(3)/z3.

we proceed as in the su(2)-case. pt ap1 is easily calculated, with p = exp(ih)

we have

php1 = h

pep1 = exp(ih, i)e

(4.7)
to calculate qt aq1 we start by decomposing the representation of the group g
into irreducible representations of su(3)/z3. first we construct the normalised
eigenvectors  of the csa: h = h, i. it then follows that
hrq = qh = h, iq = hr, riq

(4.8)

this means that q is an eigenvector of the csa with weight r. if all weights are
simple, as in the 1 and 10, then everything is easily solvable, as in the su(2) case:
q = r with  a phase. from q3 = 1, we nd that rr2 = 1. with the
ladder operators one shows that  is actually independent of  (in a suitable phase
convention). the following three combinations are eigenvectors:
 + r + r2  eigenvalue 

 + exp( 4i
 + exp( 2i

3 )r + exp( 2i
3 )r + exp( 4i

3 )r2  eigenvalue exp( 2i
3 )r2  eigenvalue exp( 4i

3 )
3 )

note that formally we have to turn to the complexication of the real lie-algebra for
this to make sense. for  = 0 the last two of these combinations are zero. we nd
that each triple of eigenvectors contributes 3 = 1 to the determinant, and since all
weights, apart from the zero weight, occur in triples we nd that the determinant is
equal to 3n+1 =  = 1.

when not all weights have multiplicity 1, the above discussion for the non-
zero weights applies anyway. it is the zero weight that causes the problems. the
eigenvectors with weight zero form a subspace that will be mapped into itself, our
previous methods fail, and we know no easy way to determine the action of q on
any vector of this subspace. for the 8, the solution is nevertheless easy to nd by
realising that this is the adjoint. the zero weights of the adjoint representation are
the generators of the csa, the h, on which we already know the action of q, and
the eigenvectors of q are

h + hr + hr2 = 0

h + exp( 4i
h + exp( 2i

3 )hr + exp( 2i
3 )hr + exp( 4i

3 )hr2  eigenvalue exp( 2i
3 )
3 )hr2  eigenvalue exp( 4i
3 )

6

we can now construct the action of q on any representation of g that splits into
singlets, octets and decuplets. as a nal remark we note that these considerations
imply that

pt ap1 = exp(

2in

3

) t a,

qt aq1 = exp(

2im

3

) t a

= h1, h

for the su(3)-subalgebra, we dene the csa generators h

2 associated
to the simple roots of su(3), following the conventions of the appendix of [5]. set
= h2 for hi  lg. we need the combinations 2i/hk, ki (see
h
eq. (3.5)), where i are the fundamental weights of su(3) and k are simple roots of
su(3). in our conventions hk, ki = 1/3, for k a root of su(3). the combinations
we need are thus

1 and h

61 = 41 + 22

62 = 21 + 42.

we write the weights of the representation of the group g as (see 3.2)

 =xi

(nii + mii) with ni, mi  z

with i the fundamental weights of g and i its simple roots. we will demand that
the representation of g branches into representations of su(3)/z3, a condition that
can be translated to

hi, 41 + 22i,

are contained in the f4 root lattice. an su(3)-sublattice is completely determined
by making a choice for its simple roots. we take for the rst su(3) factor the two

second su(3) factor we take as simple roots (0, 0, 0, 1)/18 and (1, 1, 1,1)/218.

angle in-between of 2/3 and can therefore be used as simple roots for su(3). for the

these two are orthogonal to the root vectors of the rst su(3). to construct the
su(3) algebras, we need to include appropriate normalisation factors. the rst
su(3)-factor is generated by:

h 1
1 = 3h(1,1,0,0)/18 h 1
1 = 3e(1,1,0,0)/18 e1

2 = 3h(0,1,1,0)/18
2 = 3e(0,1,1,0)/18 e1

e1

1+2 = 3e(1,0,1,0)/18

the second su(3) factor is generated by

h 1
1 = 6h(0,0,0,1)/18 h 1
1 = 6e(0,0,0,1)/18 e1
e1

2 = 6h(1,1,1,1)/218
2 = 6e(1,1,1,1)/218 e1

1+2 = 6e(1,1,1,1)/218

(4.10)

1+2 = 3e(1,0,1,0)/18 + 6e(1,1,1,1)/218

(4.12)

this algebra generates an su(3)/z3-group, as can be seen by checking the conditions
(4.9). we have 41 + 22 = 18(1, 0, 0, 1) and 21 + 42 = 18(1, 1, 0, 0), and the
inner product of these vectors with the simple roots of f4 all give integers. f4 has
no non-integer fundamental weights. the decomposition of f4 into the diagonal
su(3)/z3 is as follows:

su(3)  su(3)

(3, 3)  (3, 3)  (8, 1)

(4.13)

now look for two matrices that commute, but cannot be written as exponentials

of generators of d that commute. from (4.4)

splitting the generators of the diagonal group as h d
 + e2

reveals the product structure of p and q, which decompose accordingly as p = p1p2,
and q = q1q2. that p and q commute follows from the fact that they take the
role of the elements p and q constructed previously, and that they are elements of an
su(3)/z3-subgroup. now we wish to construct p . our methods for su(2) [5] have
to be generalised in such a way, that it produces a subgroup d that is isomorphic
to d, such that q is an element of both d and d. the appropriate generalisation
has the form of a rotation of one of the two factors

1+2 = 3e(1,1,0,0)/18 + 6e(1,1,1,1)/218

12 + e2
1 + e2

we set p  to be

p  = exp(4ih d

1+2)

(4.16)

(4.17)

p , p  and q commute by construction. since f4 is simply connected, the gauge
connection implied by the holonomies 1 = p , 2 = p  and 3 = q is at and
non-trivial.

now we calculate the unbroken subgroup: rst nd the generators that com-
mute with p , of these check how many commute with p , and nally compute the
commutator with q of the generators that commute with both p and p . these
computations can be done by using our previous results and substituting p for p and
q for q in the rst step, and in a second step p  for p and q for q . the only e
that commute with p have

  { (0,0,1,0)

}

however, none of these commute with p . hence the csa-generators are the only
ones that commute with both p and p . the eect of q on the csa can be computed
by studying the branching of f4 into su(3)/z3. careful examination shows that all
csa-generators have weight zero for the 8s in the decomposition. there is no
combination of zero weights for the 8 that is invariant under the adjoint action of
q and hence no generator commutes with p , p  and q. the unbroken subgroup is
therefore discrete.

we therefore have found a new at connection: neither the trivial at connection
nor the at connection constructed in [5] can be deformed to a at connection that
has a discrete unbroken subgroup. note that instead of the rotation (4.15) we could
also have rotated by

(4.18)

repeating the steps for the construction of d, this gives another diagonal subgroup,
that we will call d. it is also possible to construct an element p  = exp(4ih d
1+2).
p  commutes with p , p , and q, and can be used in the construction of non-trivial
at connections. the at connection corresponding to 1 = p , 2 = p  and 3 = q
is not equivalent to the one corresponding to 1 = p , 2 = p  and 3 = q, as will
be proven in a subsequent publication. these two at connections both have discrete
unbroken subgroups.

we remind the reader that the non-trivial at connection in so(7) in [3] was
characterised by simultaneously diagonalising the three holonomies in the 7 di-
mensional vector representation. the 7 triples ((1)ii, (2)ii, (3)ii) are the triples

9

(1,1,1) with at least one 1.
(1,1,1) correspond to the positions of d-branes at orientifold xed points.

in wittens original construction, the triples

there is a remarkable resemblance between this result and the su(3)-based non-
trivial at connection in f4. we can diagonalise the holonomies constructed here.
on the diagonal we have the eigenvalues exp(2in/3). take now the triples

(exp(

2in1

3

), exp(

2in2

3

), exp(

2in3

3

))

ni  z

(4.19)

and exclude the triple (1, 1, 1). there are 33  1 = 26 distinct triples, and this is
precisely the dimension of the fundamental irrep of f4.
indeed, constructing the
elements p , p  and q in the 26 of f4 and diagonalising, we nd that the triples of
diagonal elements (pii, p ii, qii) are precisely the 26 triples mentioned above. it is an
intriguing question whether this too can be related to an m-theory construction.

4.3.2 e6
in e6 there is a su(3)3-subgroup that is suitable for our purposes. the su(3)-factors
have root vectors

su(3)1 : 1
su(3)2 : 2
su(3)3 : 3

1 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1)/24, 1

the relevant geometrical properties are easily veried. to construct the su(3) alge-
bras, we need to include appropriate normalisation factors. a full exposition would
be very space consuming, so we limit ourselves to a few points.

this algebra generates an su(3)/z3-group, as can be seen by checking the conditions
(4.9). this subgroup corresponds to the decompositions

the diagonal subalgebras d and d are obtained by rotating one of the three su(3)
factors by (4.15) resp. (4.18). the holonomies are then 1 = p , 2 = p  and 3 = q
with

(4.24)

again the subgroup d gives rise to an element p , and the exchange p   p 
produces a non-equivalent at connection with the unbroken discrete subgroup.

these e6-at connections are essentially the same as the ones for f4, as can be

understood from the decomposition.

e6  f4
27  26  1
78  52  26

(4.25)

like the embedding of g2 in so(7) of [5], it is not hard to make this explicit. take the
roots of e6 (in the conventions of [5]), set the rst and last component of each vector
to zero, and renormalise the vectors by multiplying with 2/3. this projection gives
the roots of f4. applying the same projection to the roots (4.20), one nds that the
su(3)3 subgroup of e6 projects onto an su(3)2 subgroup of f4.

we furthermore note that, concerning the remark in the previous paragraph on
the triples (4.19), that in the fundamental 27 irrep of e6, the holonomies can be
constructed from these triples with the triple (1, 1, 1) included.

4.3.3 e7

because the e6-lattice is a sub-lattice of the e7-lattice, it is not hard to embed
the previous e6 result into e7. working out all details, one nds two inequivalent
non-trivial at connections with an unbroken su(2), precisely as one would naively
expect from the decomposition of e7 in f4  su(2)

e7  f4  su(2)

133  (52, 1)  (26, 3)  (1, 3)

(4.26)

4.3.4 e8

as the e6-lattice is also a sublattice of the lattice of e8, our construction is easily
extended to e8. one nds two inequivalent non-trivial at connections with unbroken
subgroup g2, in accordance to the decomposition

5. non-trivial vacua based on twist in su (4)

it is also possible to use su(4) for a construction of non-trivial at connections.
however, we need a subtle modication with respect to the su(2) and su(3) con-
structions. after developing the relevant tools for su(4), we will construct the
explicit realisation of this construction in the groups e7 and e8.

5.1 twist in su(4)

we will take the canonical form (in the conventions of the appendices of [5]), where
again we will use h and e for the generators of the subgroup, and h and e for
the generators of the original group.

in su(4) we look for two matrices satisfying

pq = exp(

2i
4

)qp

(5.1)

we take:

p =




exp( 3i
4 )

0
0
0

exp( i

in terms of generators this is

p = exp (2ih31+42+33)

q = exp(cid:16)i

exp( 3i

q =

(e12 + e23) + (1 + i)(e1 + e2 + e3 + e1+2+3))(cid:17)

(5.4)

the commutation relations of p and q with the group generators are most easily

calculated in a specic representation. one nds

ph = hp,
qh = hrq,
pe = exp(2ih, 31 + 42 + 34i)ep, qe = erq.

(5.5)

the action of the rotation r (which is in this case a combination of a genuine rotation
and a reection) is fully determined by its action on the simple roots.

r :

1  2  3  (1 + 2 + 3)  1

(5.6)

just like in the su(3)-case this is nicely visualised by a rotation of the extended
dynkin diagram of su(4). r is an element of the weyl group: it is the composition
of the weyl reection generated by 3, followed by the reection generated by 2 and
the reection generated by 1. it is obvious that r4 = 1, but on the vectors that are
a multiple of 1 + 3 r acts as a reection, and we even have r2(1 + 3) = 1 + 3.

12

5.2 calculation of the unbroken subgroup

for the computation of the combinations pt ap1 and qt aq1, we will need several
representations of su(4). for the construction in the fundamental 56 irrep of e7 we
need the 1, 15 and 6 of su(4). for the construction in the adjoints of e7 and e8
(the 133 resp. 248) we furthermore need the 10 and 20 of su(4). note that the
6 and 10 still contain a non-trivial z2 centre, which is a subgroup of the z4 centre
of their simply connected covering su(4). to compensate for the non-trivial z2, we
will use the su(2) factor in the decomposition e7  su(4)  su(4)  su(2). we
will need only the one-, two- and three dimensional representation of su(2), and
relevant facts about these representations can be found in our previous article [5].

the calculation of pt ap1 proceeds in the same way as in (4.7). for qt aq1
we start again by decomposing the representation of the group g into irreducible
representations of su(4). construct the normalised eigenvectors  of the csa:
h = h, i. it then follows that

hrq = qh = h, iq = hr, riq

(5.7)

this means that q is an eigenvector of the csa with weight r. for simple weights,
we have q = r with  a phase. because all representations we consider are
representations of su(4)/z2, we have q4 = 1 and we nd that rr2r3 = 1.
with the ladder operators one shows that  is actually independent of  (in a suit-
able phase convention). for  6= 0 the following four combinations are eigenvectors:

 + r + r2 + r3  eigenvalue 
  ir  r2 + ir3  eigenvalue i
  r + r2  r3  eigenvalue  
 + ir  r2  ir3  eigenvalue  i

note that for weights  with r2 = , two of these combinations are zero.

the 6 and 10 do not posses zero weights, and by checking the eigenvalues we
nd that the phase  = 1. the above considerations thus determine the action of
q up to an overall sign. in the actual constructions for e7 and e8, this sign will be
compensated for by another sign coming from an su(2)-subgroup.

the 15 is the adjoint of su(4). among the fteen weights there are 12 non-zero
weights, that decompose in 3 4-cycles under the action of q. the remaining three
zero weights correspond to the generators of the csa, the h, on which we already
know the action of q. the eigenvectors of q are

h + hr + hr2 + hr3 = 0
h  ihr  hr2 + ihr3  eigenvalue i
h  hr + hr2  hr3  eigenvalue  1
h + ihr  hr2  ihr3  eigenvalue  i

13

the last irrep we wish to consider is the 20. the easiest way to reconstruct the
action of q in this irrep, is to use the decomposition of the tensor product of two
6s: 6  6 = 1  15  20. from this decomposition we quickly nd that the 20 has
18 non-zero-weights, which under the action of q decompose in 4 4-cycles and one
2-cycle. the two zero weights form a 2-cycle.

we note that these considerations imply that

pt ap1 = exp(cid:18)2in

4 (cid:19) t a,

qt aq1 = exp(cid:18)2im

4 (cid:19) t a

to compute the representations of su(4) we follow the same route as for su(3).
dene the csa generators h
3 associated to the simple roots of su(4),
i = hi, for hi  lg. we
following the conventions of the appendix of [5]. set h
need the combinations 2i/hk, ki (see eq. (3.5)), where i are the fundamental
weights of su(4) and k are simple roots of su(4). in our conventions hk, ki = 1/4,
for k a root of su(4). the combinations we need are thus

2 and h

1, h

81 = 61 + 42 + 23

82 = 41 + 82 + 43

83 = 21 + 42 + 63.

the qk from eq. (3.5) can then be found by computing the inner products of 8i
with the weights of g.

5.3 realisations of the su(4)-based construction

5.3.1 e7
as mentioned before, we need the subgroup of e7 whose universal cover is su(2) 
su(4)  su(4). this subgroup can be chosen to be regular, such that its lattice is
a sublattice of the e7-lattice. we take as su(2)-root:
(2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)/6

(5.8)

for the rst su(4) factor that we will label su(4)1, we take as roots:

1

1 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1)/6

1
2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1,1, 0)/6

1
3 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,1)/6
(5.9)

the second su(4)-factor (su(4)2) has as roots:

2

1 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)/6

2
3 = (0, 0, 1,1, 0, 0, 0)/6
(5.10)
with these roots we have the following branching rules for e7 into su(2) su(4)
su(4)

2
2 = (0, 1,1, 0, 0, 0, 0)/6

e7  su(2)  su(4)  su(4)

133  (1, 15, 1)  (1, 1, 15)  (3, 1, 1)  (1, 6, 6)  (2, 4, 4)  (2, 4, 4)

in the su(4)  su(4)-part we construct as usual a diagonal subgroup d. we only
list the cartan generators:

i = 1

i +2

l3 = 3h(2,0,0,0,0,0,0)

3 = (0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) (where d

(5.13)
we compute the inner products of the weights of e7 with (32, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) to nd
the su(2)-representations (if the inner product is integer, the corresponding weight
belongs to an so(3) representation, otherwise it is a genuine su(2) representation
with z2-centre [5]). to check the su(4) irreps, it is sucient to compute q1 (see (3.5))
for the diagonal group. q1 is found by computing the inner product of the weights of
e7 with 6d
i are the simple roots
for the diagonal group). if q1 mod 1 = 3/4 the weight belongs to a representation of
the fundamental su(4), for q1 mod 1 = 1/4 it belongs to an irrep that is congruent to
the complex conjugate of the fundamental, for q1 mod 1 = 1/2 the irrep is congruent
to su(4)/z2, and if q1 is an integer the irrep is congruent to su(4)/z4. careful
examination shows that all weights of e7 fall into two categories: one category is
formed by weights that are in an irrep of (su(4)/z4)  so(3), while the second
category consist of weights that are in an faithful irrep of (su(4)/z2)  su(2). we
now construct the elements

in the su(2) group. for a weight  with corresponding eigenvector , that belongs
to an (su(4)/z4)  so(3)-irrep, we have

psu (4)qsu (4) = qsu (4)psu (4)

psu (2)qsu (2) = qsu (2)psu (2)

if the weight  belongs to a faithful (su(4)/z2)  su(2)-irrep, we have

psu (4)qsu (4) = qsu (4)psu (4)

psu (2)qsu (2) = qsu (2)psu (2)

15

the products

p = psu (2)psu (4) = exp(3ih(2,2,1,0,2,1,0)),

q = qsu (2)qsu (4)

(5.17)

are commuting elements of e7, since they commute on each weight of any represen-
tation. we construct another diagonal subgroup d in su(4)  su(4) as usual, by
applying the rotation

r : 1  2  3  (1 + 2 + 3)  1,

to the rst su(4) factor and then reconstructing the diagonal subgroup.
diagonal subgroup we construct an element

p su (4) = exp(ih d

31+42+33)

the same considerations as above lead to the conclusion that the element

p  = psu (2)p su (4) = exp(3ih(2,0,1,2,2,1,0))

(5.18)

in this

(5.19)

(5.20)

commutes with p and q, and hence we have three candidate holonomies 1 = p ,
2 = p  and 3 = q.

next we calculate the unbroken subgroup. computing the commutators of the
generators of e7 with p and p , we nd that only the csa-generators of e7 com-
mute with both p and p . these csa generators correspond to zero weights in the
representation of the su(2) su(4) su(4) subgroup, and from previous consider-
ations we know that there is no combination of zero weights of the adjoints of su(4)
or su(2) that commutes with q. hence we nd that there is no generator that
commutes with p , p  and q, and the unbroken subgroup is at most discrete.

instead of the rotation r (5.18), one could also apply the rotations r2 or r3 to
construct elements that we will call p  resp. p . the holonomies 1 = p , 2 = p 
and 3 = q also only commute with a discrete subgroup of e7, and give a non-trivial
at connection inequivalent to the one implied by 1 = p , 2 = p  and 3 = q.
the non-trivial at connection implied by 1 = p , 2 = p  and 3 = q gives a
bigger unbroken subgroup. the unbroken symmetry group can be calculated to be
u(1)3, and this non-trivial at connection is actually a gauge deformation of the at
connection constructed in [5], based on twist in su(2). therefore the construction
based on twist in su(2)su(4)su(4) gives two new vacua with discrete symmetry
group, and a gauge deformation of a vacuum conguration that we have encountered
before.

we wish to point out that also the su(4)-based construction in e7 ts into a
pattern. we already remarked that the g2 and so(7) non-trivial at connection
can be described by the 7 triples (1,1,1) with at least one 1, and that the
su(3)-based construction in f4 can be characterised by the 26 triples (4.19) with at

16

least one element not equal to 1. for the su(4)-based construction, the eigenvalues
that appear on the diagonal of the diagonalised holonomies are in. consider now the
triples (in1, in2, in3) with nj  z. there are 43 = 64 distinct triples. now exclude
all triples that are not of order 4, by which we mean that we demand each triple
to contain at least one i or i. we are then left with 64  23 = 56 triples. 56
is precisely the dimension of the fundamental irrep of e7, and indeed, constructing
the holonomies in this representation and diagonalising, we nd that the triples
((1)ii, (2)ii, (3)ii) are precisely the triples mentioned above.

5.3.2 e8
the su(2)  su(4)  su(4) construction of e7 can be easily embedded in e8 by
using the fact that the e7-lattice is a sublattice of the e8-lattice. more specic, we
can take as su(2)-root:

(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)/60

(5.21)

(5.22)

(5.23)

one su(4) factor has as roots:

1 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1)/60
2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,1, 0)/60
3 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,1)/60

a second su(4)-factor is generated by the roots:

1 = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)/60
2 = (0, 0, 1,1, 0, 0, 0, 0)/60
3 = (0, 0, 0, 1,1, 0, 0, 0)/60

with this information it is trivial to copy the e7 construction. like in the e7-case,
one nds 3 vacua. for two of these, the subgroup unbroken by the e7 holonomies is
su(2). this is to be expected, since e8 decomposes into e7  su(2):

e8  e7  su(2)
248  (133, 1)  (56, 2)  (1, 3)

(5.24)

the third vacuum is, as for e7, a gauge deformation of the vacuum based on twist
in su(2) constructed in [5].

6. non-trivial vacua based on twist in su (5)

6.1 twist in su(5)

we will take the canonical form (in the conventions of the appendices of [5]), where
again we will use h and e for the subgroup, and h and e) for the original group.

the commutation relations of p and q with the group generators are most easily

calculated in a specic representation. one nds

ph = hp,
qh = hrq,
pe = exp(2ih, 41 + 62 + 63 + 44i)ep, qe = erq.

(6.7)

the action of the rotation r (which is in this case a genuine rotation) is fully deter-
mined by its action on the simple roots.

r :

1  2  3  4  (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)  1

(6.8)

again this can be conveniently depicted by a permutation of the roots of the extended
dynkin diagram of su(5). r is an element of the weyl group: it is the composition
of the weyl reection generated by 4, followed by the reections generated by 3,
2, and 1.

for the calculation of the unbroken subgroup we will only need the action of
q on the zero weights of the adjoint. these are the csa-generators, on which the
action of q is easily diagonalised. the only fact we will need is that there is no linear
combination of csa-generators that commutes with q.

the congruence classes of the irreducible components of su(5)  su(5) are then1
(0, 0) with multiplicity 2, and (3, 1), (1, 2), (4, 3) and (2, 4) all with multiplicity 1.
we note that for each congruence class (a, b) we have a + 2b mod 5 = 0. since all e8
representations are isomorphic, this must automatically hold for any e8 representa-
tion.

when acting on an eigenvector , corresponding to a weight  that belongs to an
irrep with su(5)  su(5)-congruence class labelled by (n1, n2), pi and qi obey the
following commutation rule

piqi = exp(cid:18) 2ini

5 (cid:19) qipi

(6.15)

1we will label the irrep with dynkin labels (1000) as 5 and the irrep with labels (0010) as
10. we dene the congruence class of the representation with dynkin labels (n1, n2, n3, n4) to be
labelled by the integer n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 + 4n4 mod 5.

19

from the above observation on congruence classes it follows that for any weight  of
e8 we have

p1q1(p2)2q2 = exp(cid:18) 2i(n1 + 2n2)

5

(cid:19) q1p1q2(p2)2 = q1p1q2(p2)2 (6.16)

hence the elements

p = p1(p2)2,

q = q1q2

commute. a third commuting element is constructed in the standard way:

p  = qn

1 p qn

1 = qn

2 p qn

(6.17)

(6.18)

n can range from 1 to 4, and therefore there are 4 dierent at connections con-
structed this way. we will work out the case where n = 1.

in that case we have

p = exp(cid:18)2i
p  = exp(cid:18)2i

(6.20)

after a somewhat tedious calculation we nd that none of the ladder operators e of
e8 commutes with both p and p , so we are only left with the 8 cartan generators.
we have to check whether these commute with q. q has been constructed in such
a way that it is an element of the diagonal su(5)-subgroup, so we can apply our
previous methods. the elements of the cartan subalgebra are also the csa elements
for su(5)su(5), and we know that none of these are invariant under commutation
with q (q takes the role of q in the diagonal subgroup of su(5)  su(5)). hence
no group generator commutes with p , p  and q simultaneously, and the unbroken
subgroup is at most discrete.

for the su(5) based construction, the eigenvalues that appear in the diagonalised

holonomies are exp(cid:0) 2in

5 (cid:1). consider now the triples

if one excludes the triple (1, 1, 1), there are 53  1 = 124 distinct triples of this type.
unlike the cases we considered previously, 124 is not the dimension of any represen-
tation of e8. the smallest non-trivial representation of e8 is the 248-dimensional
adjoint. constructing the holonomies in the adjoint and diagonalising, one nds that
the 248 triples (pii, p ii, qii) consist of precisely two sets of the above 124 triples.

7. non-trivial vacua based on twist in su (2)  su (3)

at rst sight all possibilities seem to be exhausted, since constructions with su(n),
n > 5 are impossible because the exceptional groups are not big enough to contain

20

more than one su(6)-factor. there is however still one more possibility, based on
our previous constructions based on su(2) and su(3).
it is easy to see that e8
allows the su(2) non-trivial at connection to be realised simultaneously with the
su(3)-at connection.

7.1 e8
according to the decomposition (4.27) e8 allows a g2  f4 subgroup (in this case
we are dealing with a subgroup that is a genuine product). in [5] we constructed
holonomies for a non-trivial at connection in g2, that we named p , p  and q. here
we will rename them to pg2, p g2 and qg2 to avoid confusion. f4 allows dierent
types of non-trivial at connections. we will use the non-trivial at connections con-
structed in section 4.3.1, and will rename the holonomies p , p , p  and q constructed
there to pf4, p f4, p f4 and qf4. decomposing e8 into its g2 f4 subgroup, elements
of this subgroup can be denoted by a pair of elements (gg2, gf4) with gg2  g2 and
gf4  f4. therefore (pg2, pf4) and (qg2, qf4) represent commuting elements of
e8. a third commuting element can be constructed by applying the standard proce-
dure of rotating group factors to both elements of the pair to construct the element
(p g2, p f4). the rotation can be applied multiple times to construct multiple triples.
we have the following possibilities:

1 = (pg2, pf4) 2 = (p g2, p f4) 3 = (qg2, qf4)
1 = (pg2, pf4) 2 = (pg2, p f4) 3 = (qg2, qf4)
1 = (pg2, pf4) 2 = (p g2, pf4) 3 = (qg2, qf4)
1 = (pg2, pf4) 2 = (pg2, p f4) 3 = (qg2, qf4)
1 = (pg2, pf4) 2 = (p g2, p f4) 3 = (qg2, qf4)

(7.1)

(7.2)

(7.3)

(7.4)

(7.5)

however, not all of these are new. the at connection implied by the holonomies (7.2)
has twice the element pg2 in the g2-factor: this means that in the g2 subgroup the
connection can be deformed to a trivial one, and only the f4 part is non-trivial. this
is a deformation of one of the at connections based on su(3)-twist that was already
constructed previously. similarly the at connection implied by the holonomies (7.4)
is deformable to the other at connection based on su(3)-twist. the at connection
implied by (7.3) is trivial in its f4 factor, and only non-trivial in its g2 part. it is
therefore a deformation of the at connection in e8 that was constructed in [5]. the
remaining two at connections are new. we note that, to commute a generator with
the i, we can commute it rst with the g2-element and then with the f4-element.
we can choose a basis of generators such that they commute or anti-commute with
the g2-elements, and they commute up to a z3-element with the f4-elements. we
conclude that to commute with the i a generator has to commute with both the
g2 and the f4-elements. the generators that commute with the g2 part of the
holonomies generate the f4 subgroup in the decomposition g2  f4. the f4 part

21

of the holonomies breaks this f4 group completely. hence only discrete symmetries
commute with the holonomies constructed here.

8. re-evaluation of tr()f

one of the motivations for this research was to check whether non-trivial at connec-
tions may solve the problem of calculating tr()f in supersymmetric gauge theories
with exceptional gauge groups. we announced in [5] that it does, and we will now
justify this claim.

we have shown that the bosonic equations of motion allow several solutions, to be
divided in several components of the moduli space. upon quantisation one nds that
each component implies a bosonic vacuum [1, 3]. to perform the vacuum count one
has to count in how many ways zero-energy fermions can be added. the reasoning
of [1] implies that in each case there are r ways to add fermion pairs to the vacuum,
with r the rank of the subgroup that is unbroken on the specic component of moduli
space. this gives r bosonic vacua, which together with the original vacuum based
on a conguration with bosonic elds only gives a contribution of r + 1 to tr()f .
we now summarise the results of this paper and [5]:

 f4: we have found 4 components of the moduli space of f4:

 as always there is the component of the trivial at connections. at a
generic point there is a rank 4 unbroken subgroup, giving a contribution
of r + 1 = 5 to tr()f .

 in [5] we constructed a new component in moduli space that has maximal
unbroken symmetry group so(3). by deforming around this solution one
nds a component of moduli space that has a rank 1 unbroken subgroup,
giving a contribution of r + 1 = 2 to tr()f .

 as announced in [5], and explicitly constructed here, there are two com-
ponents in moduli space that have unbroken discrete symmetry group.
these solutions cannot be deformed, and give contributions of r + 1 = 1
to tr()f .

the witten index count for f4 sym on t 3  r thus gives

tr()f = 5 + 2 + (1 + 1) = 9,

in full agreement with the innite volume calculation since the dual coxeter
number h = 9 for f4

 e6: we have found 4 components of the moduli space of e6:

22

 the component of the trivial at connections. at a generic point there is
a rank 6 subgroup unbroken, giving a contribution of r + 1 = 7 to tr()f .
 in [5] we constructed a point in moduli space that has maximal unbroken
symmetry group su(3). by deforming around this solution one nds a
component of moduli space that has a rank 2 subgroup unbroken, giving
a contribution of r + 1 = 3 to tr()f .

 in this article we explicitly constructed two components in moduli space
that have unbroken discrete symmetry group. these solutions cannot be
deformed, and each contribute r + 1 = 1 to tr()f .
the witten index count for e6 sym on t 3  r thus gives

tr()f = 7 + 3 + (1 + 1) = 12,

in full agreement with the innite volume calculation since the dual coxeter
number h = 12 for e6.

 e7: we have found 6 components of the moduli space of e7:

 the component of the trivial at connections. at a generic point there is
a rank 7 subgroup unbroken, giving a contribution of r + 1 = 8 to tr()f .
 in [5] we constructed a point in moduli space that has maximal unbroken
symmetry group sp(3). by deforming around this solution one nds a
component of moduli space that has a rank 3 subgroup unbroken, giving
a contribution of r + 1 = 4 to tr()f .

 in this article we explicitly constructed, based on twist in su(3)-subgroups,
two components in moduli space with maximal unbroken symmetry group
su(2). deformations leave a rank 1 unbroken subgroup. we get contri-
butions of each r + 1 = 2 to tr()f .

 based on twist in the su(4)  su(4)  su(2)-subgroups, two more com-
ponents were constructed that consist of a point in moduli space that has
unbroken discrete symmetry group. these solutions cannot be deformed,
and each contributes r + 1 = 1 to tr()f .

the witten index count for e7 sym on t 3  r thus gives
tr()f = 8 + 4 + (2 + 2) + (1 + 1) = 18,

in full agreement with the innite volume calculation since the dual coxeter
number h = 18 for e7.

 e8: we have found 12 components of the moduli space of e8:

23

 the component of the trivial at connections. at a generic point there is
a rank 8 subgroup unbroken, giving a contribution of r + 1 = 9 to tr()f .
 in [5] we constructed a point in moduli space that has unbroken symmetry
group f4. by deforming around this solution one nds a component of
moduli space that has a rank 4 subgroup unbroken, giving a contribution
of r + 1 = 5 to tr()f .

 in this article, based on twist in su(3)-subgroups, two components in
moduli space were constructed with maximal unbroken symmetry group
g2. at a generic point of each of the two components there is a rank 2
subgroup unbroken. each component contributes r + 1 = 3 to tr()f .
 based on twist in the su(4)  su(4)  su(2)-subgroups, two more com-
ponents in moduli space were found with maximal unbroken su(2) sym-
metry group. deformations always leave a rank 1 subgroup unbroken.
the components contribute each r + 1 = 2 to tr()f .

 with twist in the su(5)  su(5)-subgroup, four more components were
constructed with unbroken discrete symmetry group. these solutions can-
not be deformed, and contribute each r + 1 = 1 to tr()f .

 last, by using (su(2)  su(3))2-subgroups, two more components were
constructed that have unbroken discrete symmetry group. these solutions
can also not be deformed, and contribute each r + 1 = 1 to tr()f .

the witten index count for e8 sym on t 3  r thus gives

tr()f = 9 + 5 + (3 + 3) + (2 + 2) + (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 30

in agreement with the innite volume calculation since the dual coxeter number
h = 30 for e8.

9. discussion and conclusions

the construction of non-trivial at connections with our method reveals that the
moduli spaces of exceptional gauge theories on t 3  r consists of many components.
the witten index count indicates that all non-trivial at connections have been
found. thus for supersymmetric yang-mills theory both the two extreme cases of
the innite volume (r4) and small volume (t 3  r) have h vacua, with h the dual
coxeter number of the gauge group. it would be interesting to learn more about
the intermediate volume regime, and the character of the h vacua there. more open
questions are the chern-simons functional of the gauge eld conguration, and the
chirality assignment of the dierent disconnected components.

an intriguing question is what happens for higher dimensional tori. it is clear
that the non-trivial at connections for the 3torus can always be trivially embedded

24

on an ntorus, by taking (n 3) holonomies equal to the identity, and the remaining
3 holonomies given by our construction. however, also more general congurations
are possible. our method is basically a construction of commuting elements for
certain gauge groups, and a set of n commuting elements may be used as holonomies
on an ntorus. for su(n) and sp(n) theories the moduli space always consists of
one component, regardless of n, but for other groups the number of components of
moduli space might grow further with n.

we expect that the at connections constructed in this paper are of relevance in
toroidal compactications of the e8  e8 heterotic string, just like the original con-
structions of [3] are of relevance for the string theories with so(32) gauge groups.
e8 has a rich moduli space of 12 components, but our analysis shows that many
components survive for exceptional subgroups of e8. another question is what hap-
pens to all these vacuum solutions under various dualities. we hope that explicit
expressions for the holonomies, as we have constructed, may be helpful in answering
these questions.
