(1) (2) also, jacobi identity lie algebra imposes following relations structure constants lie algebras g g : fmk f jm l fml f jm k fmk j f im l + fml j f im k = fkl f ij m. (3) see next section relations put rather strong constraint structure constants subalgebras. hence, obtaining bialgebra manin triple becomes rather tough job. order dene models poisson-lie duality symmetry, need consider following relations : g1xig = a(g)i jxj, g1 x ig = b(g)ijxj + d(g)i x j, j (4) g g elements lie groups g g associated lie algebras g g, respec- tively. invariance inner product respect adjoint action group together (2) (4) requires matrices possess following properties: (g) = b(g)a1(g), d(g) = at(g), a1(g) = a(g1), bt(g) = b(g1), t(g) = (g). (5) matrices a(g), b(g) (g) associated group g dened similar way. now, dene -model d-dimensional target manifold m, group g acts freely : = 1 2 z d+d, (6) coupling matrices are: e = (e01 + )1, (1) = ee01f (1), (2) = f (2)e01e, 3 (7) ( = 1, ..., ddimg) coordinates m/g manifold. matrices e01, f (1), f (2) f arbitrary functions only. similarly, coupling matrices dual -model written : = f f (2)ee01f (1). e = (e0 + )1, (1) = ef (1), (2) = f (2) e, (8) target space dual model d-dimensional manifold group g acting freely it. corresponding dual action written as: = f f (2) ef (1). = 2 z d+d. (9) actions (6) (9) correspond poisson-lie dual models  1. notice group g( g) besides free action m( ), acts transitively it, corresponding manifolds m( ) groups g( g). case rst term appears actions (6) (9). also group g becomes isometry group manifold dual abelian group g, get standard nonabelian duality . 3 bianchi bialgebras section, use (3) obtian dual lie algebras g given 3-dimensional real lie algebras g. then, introducing nondegenerate adjoint invariant bilinear form get corresponding manin triples. according behrs classication  3-dimensional bianchi lie algebras , commutation relation algebras generally written as:  = ax2 + n3x3,  = n1x1,  = n2x2 + ax3, (10) structure constants given table 1 2. table 1 : bianchi classication three dimensional lie algebras. 1actually noethers current associated action g( g) ( ) satisfy maurer-cartan equation structure constants dual lie group g(g). ratio a2 2for three algebras iii, v ia v iia, nonzero parameters a, n2 n3, rescaling basis yields constant. algebras one choose basis structure constants 1, table 1. n2n3 4 type ii v ii0 v i0 ix v iii v iv v iia (a = 1) iii v ia (a 6= 1) ) n1 n2 n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 -1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 -1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 -1 lie algebras table 1 an1 = 0. algebras = 0 called class nonvanishing called class b. determine dual lie algebra g, using structure constant lie algebra g given (10). due antisymmetricity (3) respect set indices (i, j) (k, l), relations, algebraic calculations help (10), lead following nine equations n1 f 23 1 n2 f 13 2 = n3 f 12 3, n2 f 13 3 = n2 f 12 2, n3 f 13 n1 f 23 2 = n1 f 13 1, 3 = n3 f 12 2, n1 f 32 2 + f 31 a( f 32 a( f 32 3 + f 12 3 + n2 f 31 1 + n3 f 12 1) = n3( f 12 1) = n2( f 13 2 n3 f 21 3 = n1 f 12 1, n1 f 23 3 = n2 f 13 2, 1 + f 23 3), 1 f 23 2), 3 f 21 2 = n1 f 23 1. f 31 (11) equations coeecients eliminated, reason presence due vanishing algebras. now, order determine structure constants dual lie algebras g associated listed table 1, could write (11) them. then, using jacobi identity g, determine f ij 3. algebras g reduces lie algebras bianchi type (a) use following general form structure constant given 3-dimensional lie algebra: k f ij k = ijk nlk + kak j kai, ai components 3-vector nij elements symmetric matrix constraint nijaj = 0; (b) work basis diagonalizes matrix nij diagonal elements (n1, n2, n3) vector ak components (a, 0, 0). but, instead performing steps, choose another method rather less camputations obtain results, follows. similar fij k following form: k assume f ij  = x2 + n3 x3,  = n1 x1, 3after using (11) lie algebra, number equations becomes less nine. 5 (11) reduces n1n1 = 0, aa = n2n2 = n3n3.  = n2 x2 + x3. (12) (13) hence structure constants (a, n1, n2, n3) dual lie algebra g determined terms structure constants (a, n1, n2, n3) lie algebra g. example, g = ix, (13) table 1 have: n1 = n2 = n3 = 0 arbitrary constant. now, = 0 obtain bianchi type 6= 0 get bianchi type v rescale basis = 1. therefore, lie algebra ix two dierent dual lie algebras i, v . bialgebras already used references . another example consider g = v ii0, n1 = n2 = 0 together n3 become arbitrary. case dual lie algebra g one following four dierent bianchi lie algebras: 1) n3 = = 0, get bianchi type i. 2) n3 6= 0 = 0 via rescaling change basis, get bianchi type ii. 3) n3 = 0 6= 0 via rescaling basis, get bianchi type v . 4) finally, n3 6= 0 6= 0 via rescaling basis, get bianchi type iv . therefore lie algebra v ii0 four dierent dual lie algebras i, ii, v , iv . also determined possible dual lie algebras bianchi lie algebras, results given table 2. g(class a) ii v ii0 v i0 ix v iii g(class b) v iv v iia iii v ia table 2 : bianchi bialgebras. g bianchi algebras bianchi algebras except types ix, v iii i, ii, v, iv i, ii, v, iv i, v i, v g class i, ii, v ii0, v i0 (class except types ix, v iii) i, ii, v iia (a = 1 a) i, ii, iii i, ii, v ia (a = 1 ) table 2, bianchi lie algebras, except types ix v iii, three dierent dual lie algebras. also bianchi algebras ii, iii, v ia v iia self dual. 6 number dierent bialgebras listed table 2, 28 4. far able obtain possible bialgebras associated bianchi algebras. mentioned previous section, order manin triple associated bialgebras, need nondegenerate ad-invariant inner product algebra = g g, algebras g g become isotropic respect it. order obtain inner product choose set {ta} = {x1, x2, x3, x1, x2, x3} basis d. notice one lie algebra, considering algebras g g commutation relation (10) (12), respectively, give general form d. now, writing commutation relation algebras as:  = cab ctc, a, b = 1, ..., 6, structure constants cab basis ta following matrix form adjoint representation d: c obtained using (1), (10) (12). ti = 0 xi yi (xi)t , ti+3 = ( x i)t yi x 0 , (14) 0 0 0 0 0 n2 xi, adjoint representation basis bianchi lie algebra g, antisymmetric matrices yi are: x1 = y1 = 0 n3 0 0 n1 0 0 n2 0 0 n2 0 0 ,x3 = ,y3 = 0 n3 0 n3 0 0 0 n3 0 0 0 n1 0 ,x2 = ,y2 = 0 n2 0 n1 0 0 0 0 similarly, x i, adjoint representation basis dual bianchi lie algebras g, form xi yi) dierence must replace set (a, n1, n2, n3) (a, n1, n2, n3). since, general, lie algebra non-semisimple, nondegenerate ad-invariant inner prod- uct obtained via trace bilinear product algebras adjoint representation. words killing form degenerate algebras. therefore, order obtain nondegenerate ad-invariant metric ab basis, solve following equation {$9710163$}: . 0 0 0 n1 (15) 0 0 , cab dcd + cac dbd = 0. (16) equation (16) means matrices ta. must antisymmetric matrices. hence must nd symmetric matrix relations holds. now, order determine 4it clear pair (g, g) form bialgebra, then, also, pair (g, g) lead another bialgebra. therefore total number bialgebras table 2 56. 7 bialgebra table 2, must write ta explicitly then, using antisymmetricity ta., nd explicit form . example, pair (v, ix), form is: = b 0 k 0 0 0 0 0 k b 0 k 0 0 b k 0 b 0 0 0 0 b 0 b b 0 b k 0 0 choosing k = 1 b = 0 get: 0 0 0 0 k , det = (k2 + b2)3. = 0 0 ! . (17) actually, using (14) (15) one easily show symmetric metric (17) ad-invariant metric 28 dierent bialgebras table 2, ta. 0 0 ! antisymmetric bialgebras table 2. hence, choose required inner product. also interesting see lie subalgebras bialgebras table 2 isotropic respect inner product, have: < ta, tb >= ab, < xi, x j >=< ti, tj+3 >= i,j+3 = ij, < x i, xj >=< ti+3, tj >= i+3,j = ij. (18) therefore, bialgebras table 2, together ad-invariant metric (17), form manin triples. construct -models poisson-lie symmetries associated manin triples obtained above. 4 -models bianchi lie groups mentioned section 2, order construct -models poisson-lie symmetry associated bialgerba (g, g), need know a(g) b(g). indeed every bialgebras table 2, evaluate a(g) b(g). hence -model well dual, possess poisson-lie symmetry. section give general formulas a(g) b(g) terms sets parameters (a, n1, n2, n3) (a, n1, n2, n3). therefore, appropriate choices parameters, a(g) b(g) bialgebras table 2 evaluated. hence construct -models associated them. achieve goal parametrize group g following form: g = e1x1e2x2e3x3, (19) 8 coordinates group manifold g. order calculate a(g) b(g), need calculate expressions eixixjeixi eixi x jeixi. this, must use algebraic relations (1), (10) (12). make calculation simple, need work basis d, 5: eixitaeixi = eititaeiti = (eiti)a b tb. (20) therefore, must calculate matrices eiti, due particular block diagonal form ti (14), general, following form: eiti = eixi bi 0 ei(xi)t ! . (21) calculate (21) need know block diagonal form di matrices ti together matrices si, have: sitis1 = di, eiti = s1 eidisi. put ti block diagonal form separately. t1 have: x1 ! , d1 = (x1)t 2a n 2a 0 ! , s1 = n1 n1 0 0 (22) (23) 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 hand, using following matrices: n = 0 0 . = 1 0 0 n2+n3 0 q n3 0 iq n2 n2+n3 n2+n3 q n3 iq n2 n2+n3 , = 0 0 0 + in2n3 0 0 0 0 in2n3 , write matrix x1 digonal form, using (22) matrices calculate e1x1: e1x1 = ea1 ea1 0 0 0 cos 1 sin 1 q n2 n3 0 sin 1 q n3 n2 cos 1 , (24) 1 = n2n31. help (22), (23) (24) algebraic calculations have: b1 = n1 sinh a1 0 cos 1 0 0 sin 1 n3 0 q n2 0 cos 1 q n3 n2 sin 1 5here, repeated indices imply summation. . (25) 9 b2 = b3 = similarly, matrices t2 t3, calculated matrices s2 s3, trans- form jordan forms d2 d3 (these matrices given appendix a). finally, using jordan forms together (22) considering (21), obtain following ex- pressions matrices e2t2 e3t3: e2x2 = 2 = n1n32, cos 2 0 an1n3 1 sin 2 q n3 n1 sin 2 0 q n1 n3 sin 2 n3 (cos 2 1) cos 2 , (26) n3n1n3 n3 q n1 2n2 sin 2 sin 2 + an22 n22 cos 2 n3 cos 2 2a n1n3 cos 2 sin 2 an22 n3n1n3 n3 2 (cos 2 1) a2 n22 n3n1n3 (cos 2 1) + an22n1n3 n1n3 sin 2 sin 2 n1n3 n22 cos 2 (cos 2 1) + an22n1n3 q n3 2n2 sin 2 n1 sin 2 (27) . = an3 + n2a. also 3 = n1n23, e3x3 = cos 3 q n1 n2 sin 3 0 q n2 n1 cos 3 sin 3 an1n2 sin 3 (cos 3 1) n2 0 1 , (28) cos 3 q n1 3n3 sin 3 n2 n33 cos 3 sin 3 + an33 n2n1n2 = an2 + n3a. n2 n33 cos 3 q n2 3n3 sin 3 (cos 3 1) an33n1n2 n1 cos 3 n1n2 n2n1n2 sin 3 an33 n2 n1n2 (cos 3 1) an33n1n2 2 (cos 3 1) a2 n33 n2n1n2 sin 3 2a n1n2 . sin 3 sin 3 (29) now, considering defenitions b(g) a(g) given (4), general : t1 ... t6 g1 g = a(g) b(g) 0 d(g) ! t1 ... t6 . hence due (19) (20) have: e1t1e2t2e3t3 = a(g) b(g) 0 d(g) ! . finally, using (21) get: a(g) = e1x1e2x2e3x3, b(g) = b1e2x2e3x3 + e1x1 b2e3x3 + e1x1 e2x2 b3. 10 (30) (31) (32) indeed mentioned prescription, evaluate a(g) b(g). since set a(g) b(g) associated bialgebra (g, g) set a(g) b(g) bialgebra (g, g), therefore order write a(g) b(g), enough replace parameters (a, n1, n2, n3) (a, n1, n2, n3) (31) (32), respectively. example, order determine a(g) b(g) pair (ix, v ), need calculate a(g) b(g) pair (v, ix), provided replace coordinates i. far calculations done basis parametrization (19) bianchi lie groups g. case usual parametrization bianchi groups 6, one needs consider order multiplication matrices eiti (31), based chosen group parametrization, required relations (32) obtained new representation. now, knowing matrices (g) (g) write related -models poisson- lie dual models. already mentioned, associate pair dual models bialgebra table 2. course models already studied. example models related bialgebras (i, g) (standard nonabelian duality) four dimensional space-time manifold (bianchi cosmological models) already studied details . dual -models associated bialgebra (ix, v ) investigated . also  dual models bialgebra (v iii, v ) considered. article express two pair dual -models associated bialgebras table 2. following examples, assume four dimensional manifold ({y} = {t}). also, assume f (1) = f (2) = 0 f = 1, group parametrization (19). hence action (6) reads: = 1 2 z d+d, (9) dual action is: = 1 2 z d+d. (33) (34) example rst start bialgebra (ii, ii) typical example self-dual bialgebras. using informations table 1 together relations (24-29) evaluate matrices needed determine (g) 7, given appendix b. finally matrix (g) model written as: also (g) = b1 = 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 . dg.g1 = (d1 + 2d3)x1 + d2x2 + d3x3. (35) (36) considering e0 = i, (33) (in world sheet coordinate): = 1 2 z dd . (37) 6 group ix parametrization eulerian type, groups form parametrization g = e1x3 e3x2 e2x1 . 7in caculating matrices must remove series ambiguities. 11 actually self-dual model respect poisson-lie dual transformation. indeed choose e0 arbitrary invertible constant matrix dual -model original one must replace elements e0 e01. actually particular example similar two dimensional borelian dual models reference . another example related bialgebra (ii, v ). again, calculating matrices (24-29) given appendix b, (g) written as: (g) = 0 2 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 . (38) dg.g1 form (36). hence e0 = i, (33) action original model is: = 1 2 z dd{ 1 2 + 3 1 + 2 2  + tt}. (g) = e 1 0 0 0 0 0 sinh 1 0 sinh 1 0 . hand, have: dg.g1 = 1 x 1 + e 1d 2 x 2 + e 1d 3 x 3.
