(despite appearances, geometry truly static, since global killing vector.) treating aspect realistically, must nd corrections standard results. become quantitively signicant quantum radiation carries substantial fraction mass hole. ii. tunneling describe across-horizon phenomena, necessary choose coordinates which, unlike schwarzschild coordinates, singular horizon. particularly suitable choice obtained introducing time coordinate, = ts + 22m r + 2m ln r 2m r + 2m , (1) 2 ts schwarzschild time. choice, line element reads ds2 = (cid:18)1 2m r (cid:19) dt2 + 2s2m r dt dr + dr2 + r2d2 .

(8) hence rin = 2m rout = 2 (m ). (incidentally, comparing equation eq. 5, also nd im pr = r.) although radially inward motion appears rst sight classically allowed, nevertheless classically forbidden trajectory 4 apparent horizon contracting. thus, limits integral indicate that, course classically forbidden trajectory, outgoing particle starts r = 2m , inside initial position horizon, traverses contracting horizon materialize r = 2(m ) + , outside nal position horizon. alternatively, along lines, hawking radiation also regarded pair creation outside horizon, negative energy particle tunneling black hole. since particle propagates backwards time, reverse time equations motion. line element, eq. 2, see time-reversal corresponds r q 2m q 2m r . also, since anti-particle sees geometry xed black hole mass, upshot self-gravitation replace + , rather . thus ingoing negative energy particle im = imz 0 z rin rout 1 +q 2(m +) r dr = +4(cid:18)m 2(cid:19) , (9) obtain last equation used feynmans hole theory deformation contour: + i. channels particle anti-particle tunneling contribute rate hawk- ing process so, detailed calculation, one would add amplitudes squaring order obtain semi-classical tunneling rate. considerations, however, concern pre-factor. either treatment, exponential part semi-classical emission rate, agreement , e2 im = e8(m 2 ) = e+sbh , (10) expressed result naturally terms change holes bekenstein-hawking entropy, sbh. quadratic term neglected, eq. 10 reduces boltzmann factor particle energy inverse hawking temperature 8m. 2 correction arises physics energy conservation, (roughly speaking) self-consistently raises eective temperature hole radiates. exact result must correct seen physical grounds considering limit 5 emitted particle carries away entire mass charge black hole (corresponding transmutation black hole outgoing shell). one outgoing state. hand, exp (sbh) states total. statistical mechanics asserts probability nding shell containing mass black hole proportional exp (sbh), above. following standard arguments, eq. 10 quadratic term neglected implies planck spectral ux appropriate inverse temperature 8m: () = 2 | ()|2 e+8m 1 , (11) | ()|2 frequency-dependent (greybody) transmission co-ecient out- going particle reach future innity without back-scattering. arises complete treatment modes, whose semi-classical behavior near turning point discussing. preceding techniques also applied emission charged black hole. however, outgoing radiation carries away black holes charge, calculations complicated fact trajectories also subject electromagnetic forces. restrict uncharged radiation coming reissner-nordstrom black hole. derivation proceeds similar fashion above. charged counterpart painleve line element ds2 = 1 2m r + q2 r2 ! dt2 + 2s 2m r q2 r2 dt dr + dr2 + r2d2 , (12) obtained standard reissner-nordstrom line element coordinate transformation, = tr + 2q2m r q2 + ln r 2m r q2 r + 2m r q2! + q2 2 2 q2 arctanh 2 q22m r q2 r ! , (13) tr reissner time coordinate. line element manifestly displays stationary, nonstatic, nonsingular nature spacetime. 6 equation motion outgoing massless particle dr dt = +1 2m r q2 r2 , r (14) self-gravitation included . imaginary part action positive energy outgoing particle im = imz + 0 z rout rin dr 1 q 2(m ) r (d ) , q2 r2 (15) evaluated deforming contour accordance feynmans w wi prescription. residue pole read substituting u q2 (m ) r q2. yields emission rate e2 im = e 4(cid:16)2(m 2 )(m )(m )2q2+mm 2q2(cid:17) = e+sbh .
