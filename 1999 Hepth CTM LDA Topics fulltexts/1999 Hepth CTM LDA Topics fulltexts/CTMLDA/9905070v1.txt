introduction

recently, the interest to the supersymmetric quantum mechanics (1), (2)
has been renewed. following the maldacenas conjecture (3) it has been ar-
gued (5), that the extended superconformal quantum mechanics (7), (8), (9),
(4) describes the dynamics of a d  0 brane in the near horizon background
of the extreme reisner-nordstrom black hole. in the framework of the n = 1
susy qm the exactly solvable potentials of the common qm were classi-
ed and found to be related to the integrability condition called potential
shape invariance (10), (11). there is an exciting connection of the extended
susy qm to the solution of the calogero type many body potentials (12).
it has been noted (13), that the n  4 superconformal calogero model has
not been constructed yet. these motivations lead us to consider the long-
standing problem of extending the susy qm to an arbitrary number of the
supersymmetries n. unlike the supersymmetric eld theories, where the
number n is constrained by the spin content ( n = 4 for the sym, and
n = 8 for the sugra both in d = 4), the extended susy qm appears
to have none. thus, we can consider n as a free parameter in the theory.
for the same reason the extended susy qm of n > 8 can not be the result
of the dimensional reduction of the corresponding eld theory. originally,
the susy qm was rst considered in the algebraic approach by witten
(1), (2) before the supereld approach was developed in (8), (14). the main
advantage of the latter is that it gives the susy qm a natural classical foun-
dation. on the other hand, the algebraic approach is more directly related
to the quantum mechanical aspect of the theory. although, it is possible to
obtain the results of this paper in both formalisms, we will consider here only
the generalization of the witten model, leaving the quasiclassical supereld
treatment for elsewhere. the hamiltonian of the susy qm has been ob-
tained by pashnev (16) for n = 2 and 3. it was parametrized by a single
arbitrary function known as the superpotential. the case of an arbitrary
n has not been considered there or anywhere else.
in a similar approach
we have found a framework for extending the susy qm to an arbitrary
n. our main assumption is that the hamiltonian of the susy qm must
be the sum of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group sn ,
which transform the supercharges. the representations can be parametrized
by some functions, which are all related through the compatibility conditions
to a single arbitrary function. the compatibility conditions are the result of
the requirement for the representations to be totally symmetric and to sat-

2

isfy superalgebra. they consist of the system of n  1 rst order non-linear
dierential equation for n functions, which can be solved in general for any
n. in the next sections we elaborate on the general formalism and as an
illustration consider n = 2 and 3 cases. then we treat the arbitrary n case.
in the end as a special example, we consider the extension of the conformal
susy qm to an arbitrary n.

ii. general formalism

the n susy qm is dened by the generators qi, q+

i , h of the superal-

gebra in the simplest case without the central charges as follows

{qi, q+

j } = hij, {qi, qj} = {q+
qi = 
h = h22

x + w 2 + hiw 

i , q+

j } = 0, [qi, h] = [q+

i , h] = 0 (1)

i (hx + w (x, 1, ..., i1, i+1, ..., n ))

, 3

i , 

i , 
i

i , 

where +

i , i = 1...n are sets of the pauli matrices with [+

i ] =
i . in addition they satisfy the cliord algebra {+
3
j } = ij and repre-
sent the fermionic degrees of freedom, appearing naturally in the supereld
approach after the quantization1. we require that the n supercharges are
to be transformed by the irreducible representations of the symmetric group.
hence, a superpotential form w and its derivative w  must be totally sym-
metric with respect to its fermionic variables. the expression for n super-
charges above insures that the anticommutators of qi and q+
j vanish for all
i 6= j. for all qi and q+
i the anticommutators give the same hamiltonian
with potential written in terms of the w . since the w is totally symmetric
in all i, setting any two of the potentials, equal guarantees the same for all

w 2(x, 2, 3, ..., n ) + h1w (x, 2, 3, ..., n )
= w 2(x, 1, 3, ..., n ) + h2w (x, 1, 3, ..., n )

(2)

1the cliord algebra cn can be realized in a standard way in terms of the direct

product of the  and unit matrices:

3

i  i = 1  ...  1  3

i  1  ...  1

3

we call this a compatibility condition. the explicitly symmetric form of

the w is written as

w (x, 2, 3, ..., n ) = w0 + (2 + 3 + ... + n )w1 + ... + 23...n wn 1 (3)

with this w the compatibility condition (2) turns into a system of n  1
rst order dierential equations for n functions w0,w1,...,wn 1. thus, the
solution and the hamiltonian can be parametrized by an arbitrary function.

iii. n=2 and 3

it is now appropriate to illustrate the general formalism in simple cases,

as well as to establish the connection with the known results.

a. n=2

the form w and the compatibility condition are

wn =2(x, 2) = w0 + 2w1

w 2(x, 2) + h1w (x, 2) = w 2(x, 1) + h2w (x, 1)

the equation on w0 and w1is

hw 

0 = 2w0w1

(4)

(5)

the hamiltonian h and the superpotential form are parametrizes by w0

as

hn =2 = h22

x + w0 + 2

h
2

w 
0

w0!2

+ h1 w0 + 2

h
2

w 
0

w0!

wn =2(x, 2) = w0 + 2

h
2

w 
0
w0

this reduces to n = 1 case by setting 2 to zero.

(6)

(7)

b. n=3.

the form w can be written recursively

wn =3(x, 2, 3) = w0 + 2w1 + 3 (w1 + 2w2) .

(8)

comparing this with wn =2 (4), suggests that the compatibility condition

can be written as

h (w0(x) + 2w1(x)) = 2 (w0(x) + 2w1(x)) (w1(x) + 2w2(x))

(9)

introducing new variables w1 = w0 + w1 and w2 = w0  w1with two

this is the superpotential form that was found by pashnev (16). there is
a dierent parametrization of the hamiltonian, which is more useful for the
extension to an arbitrary n. the equation (10) can be written as

(15)

and w1 as a parameter. this case can be also reduce to n = 2 by setting

2 equal to zero.

iv. arbitrary n

the superpotential symmetric form w (x, 2, 3, ..., n ) is parametrized

recursively by n functions w0,w1, ..., wn 1

w = w0 + 2w1 + 3 (w1 + 2w2) + ... + n (w1 + 2w2 + 3 (w2 + 2w3)

+... + n 1(... + 3 (wn 2 + 2wn 1) )...)

(16)

the new variables w1, w2, ... ,wn 1are introduced similar to n = 3 case.
they are all the distinct combinations of the functions w0,w1, ..., wn 2
in the rst half of the w form as i run over the values 1 in turn. we
have other n  1 relations between w1,w2, ..., wn 1 from the compatibility
condition in the way similar to (9). in the new variables wi the compatibility
condition is written as the system of n  2 equations

v. superconformal qm and calogero type potentials

the conformal quantum mechanics in d = 1 is dened (17) by the gener-
ators of the conformal group h, k, and d. the hamiltonian of the theory

h =

1

2 (cid:18)p2 +

g

x2(cid:19)

(19)

was found to have a non-normalizable ground state. when the isomor-
phism between the conformal group and the group so(2, 1) was used to
construct new generators as the linear combinations of the old, it was sug-
gested to use the generator of the compact rotation of so(2, 1) as a new
hamiltonian ( with h = 1 )

hnew =

which has a normalizable ground state with the spectrum similar to one

of a compact operator

r = r0 + n, n = 0, 1, ...

r0 =

(21)

it has been noted , that this is equivalent to elimination of a coordinate
singularity (6) or to a non-linear change of the space-time variables (8). in
the later developments (8), (7) the supersymmetric conformal qm for n = 1
and 2 was constructed.

(22)

after regularization of this matrix hamiltonian similar to that in (20)
the spectrum of this hamiltonian is obtained from the one of the common
conformal qm (21) by the substitution g  (  s1), with s1 = 1 being
the eigenvalues of the 1

notice, that the x-dependence is factorized in the conformal potential,
leaving the numerator as a polynomial of the fermionic variable . in (16) it
has been conjectured, that the factorization of the bosonic variables in case
of the conformal potential persists for arbitrary n. we are going to show
next that this is indeed the case. moreover, we have obtained a class of the
potentials with such property. the number of the potentials in each class
grows with n. a more thorough analysis is required.

in addition to the requirement for the hamiltonian to be a totally sym-
metric form of its fermionic variables we now demand the factorization of its
bosonic variables. that leaves us with the following ansatz for the superpo-
tential form w

w (x, 2, 3, ..., n ) = w0p (2, 3, ..., n )

(24)
p (2, 3, ..., n ) = 1 + a1(2 + ... + n ) + ... + an 123...n (25)

where all the wi are proportional to w0 with coecients ai. the com-

patibility condition (2) is now takes the form

w 2
= w 2

0 p (2, 3, ..., n )2 + 1w 
0 p (1, 3, ..., n )2 + 2w 

0p (2, 3, ..., n )
0p (1, 3, ..., n )

(26)

in the case of the potential w0 = 

it reduces to a system of n  1
second order algebraic equations for n variables - the coecients ai and pa-
rameter . as an example we now consider the n = 4 case. the coecients
ai are the solution of the system

which can be turned into an equation of the 6th order and gives the roots

explicitly.

similarly, n = 3 case gives three and n = 5 fteen roots. the solutions
could be relevant to the classication of the irreducible representations of sn .

8

it may turn out to be the correspondence between the n-particle conformal
susy qm and su(n) ym in d = 2 , which was discussed in (15). symme-
try and classication of the solutions for arbitrary n requires an additional
analysis. however, there is one solution that can be found for any n. when
x0 is zero, it corresponds to the known n = 1 and 2 conformal susy qm of
(7), (8) and its generalization for arbitrary n. in order to see that we rewrite
the potential as a complete square

w 2 + 1w  =

(p (2, 3, ..., n )  1

2 )2  ( 1

2 )2

(28)

the compatibility condition in this case can be written as

for any n it has a solution, which corresponds to the + sign in the

equation above

ai = 0

i 6= 1

(29)

thus, the complete hamiltonian of the conformal susy qm for any n

has identical structure with that of n = 1 (22 ), except for the constant

the n = 0 theory (21) with the result

r = r0 + n

n = 0, 1, ...

(31)

vi. discussion

we have shown above that the extended susy qm can be constructed
from the assumption, that the hamiltonian is the sum of the irreducible repre-
sentation of the symmetric group sn . in order to satisfy all the commutation
and anticommutation relations of the simplest case (without central charges)

9

of the extended superalgebra, the parametric functions of the representations
must obey the compatibility conditions. it has been shown that these condi-
tion can be solved in the iteration procedure for an arbitrary number of the
supersymmetries n. the solution allows to parametrize the hamiltonian by
a single arbitrary function. using the factorization property of the conformal
potential, the conformal susy qm has been derived for any n as a natural
generalization of the known n = 1 and n = 2 cases. however, it has been
also found that there is the whole class of possible generalizations of the the-
ory for every n corresponding to various irreducible representations of the
group sn.

we would like to point out that the formalism can be broadened to include
a number of other aspects of the susy qm. among a few, which seem to us
most interesting, we are going to discuss in the following. the incorporation
of the many dimensions (18) in this formalism will require the more general
extended superalgebra with the central charges. the equivalence of the many
dimensional and many particle theories in qm, as well as the special role of
the superconformal potential would make possible to construct the susy
qm with the calogero type potentials for any n. such theory in d = 1
and for n = 4 has been argued in (13) to be a microscopic description of
a black hole. the question of the supereld generalization of the extended
susy qm has been left open. there are exciting areas of the susy qm
such as the swkb and shape invariant potentials, which can be treated
using this formalism for arbitrary n. we can anticipate the new results in
the classication of the exactly solvable potentials. in the context of the n
arbitrary we can consider a potential of the susy qm as the expansion in
the powers of the plank constant h and consider the new limit of the number
of the supersymmetries n approaches innity.
