abstract

based on the renormalisability of the su(n) theory with massive gauge bosons, we start with the

path integral of the generating functional for the renormalized green functions and develop a method

to construct the scattering matrix so that the unitarity is evident. by using as basical variables the

renormalized eld functions and dening the unperturbed hamiltonian operator h0 that, under the

lorentz condition, describes the free particles of the initial and nal states in scattering processes, we

form an operator description with which the renormalized green functions can be expressed as the

vacuum expectations of the time ordered products of the heisenberg operators of the renormalized

eld functions, that satisfy the usual equal time commutation or anticommutation rules. from

such an operator description we nd a total hamiltonian eh that determine the time evolution of

the heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions. the scattering matrix is nothing but

the matrix of the operator u (, ), which describes the time evolution from  to  in the

interaction picture specied by eh and h0, respect to a base formed by the physical eigen states

of h0, states satisfying the lorentz condition. we also explain the asymptotic eld viewpoint of

constructing the scattering matrix within our operator description. moreover, we nd a formular to

express the scattering matrix elements in terms of the truncated renormalized green functions.

i. introduction

since the su(n) theory with a mass term of the gauge elds was considered to be in general nonrenor-

malisable (see for example [16]), the inuence of such a mass term on the unitarity of the scattering

matrix has not yet been deeply studied. now that the renormalisability of the theory has been proven[7]

further analysis is available. in the present paper, instead of checking the negative arguments concerning

the unitarity we will develop a method to construct the scattering matrix with the renormalized eld

functions as basical variables so that the unitarity is evident.

owing to the renormalisability of theory, one can start with the path integral of the generating

functional for the renormalized green functions and form an operator description with the renormalized

eld functions as basical variables. this means that the heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld

functions satisfy the usual equal time commutation or anticommutation rules and the renormalized green

functions can be expressed as the vacuum expectations of the time odered products of such heisenberg

eld operators. on the other hand starting from the path integral of the generating functional for the

unrenormalized green functions, one can form another operator description with the bare eld functions

as basical variables. it should be emphasized that such two operator descriptions are of dierent types. in

particular, the eld operators belonging to the two operator descriptions operate on dierent state spaces

and can not be transformed into each other by unitary transformations or by scale transformations.

according to the very idea of renormalisation we decide to choose the rst kind of operator de-

scription. with the renormalized eld functions and the renormalized parameters we will dene a non-

interacting lagrangian l0 which, under the lorentz condition, describes the free particles of the initial

and nal states in scattering processes. next we will nd an unperturbed hamiltonian h0 operation in a

way used in the gupta-bleuler quantization and dene a quasi-gupta-bleuler subspace (qgb) which is

spanned by all the eigen states of h0 that satisfy the lorentz condition. by giving an operator expression

for the generating functional for the green functions of the free elds, we will able to do the same for the

generating functional for the renormalized full green functions. then we can express the renormalized

green functions as the vacuum expectations of the time odered products and nd the total hamiltonian

with the qgb subspace and the operator u (, ), which describes the time evolution from  to

eh that determine the time evolution of the heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions.
 in the interaction picture specied by eh and h0, we can easily dene the scattering matrix and make

the unitarity evident.

the operator description will be given in section 2. in section 3 we will explain the denition and

2

the unitarity of the scattering matrix and briey describe the asymptotic eld viewpoint based on our

operator description. in section 4 a formular will be found to express the scattering matrix elements

in terms of the truncated renormalized green functions. concluding remarks will be given in the nal

section.

ii. operator description with renormalized eld functions as basical variables

assume that the theory has been renormalized under a proper renormalization scheme so that the

renormalized parameters such as the masses represent the physical ones. the generating functional for

the renormalized green functions can be expressed as

z [r][j, , , , ] =

1

n z d[a, c, c, , ] ya,x

 (aa(x)) expni(cid:0)i e + is(cid:1)o ,

(2.1)

where n is a contant to make z [r][0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1, is is the source term

a (x)aa(x) + a(x)ca(x) + c a(x)a(x)

is =z d4x(cid:2)j 

+a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3) .

the action i e contains the counterterm and is formed by the following lagrangian

le = 

fa f 

a +

1
4

a + l + la

m 2aaa

1
2
abcb(x) + lcount .

+(cid:0)  c a(x)(cid:1)d

(2.2)

the free evolution of the physical particles of the initial and nal staes in scattering processes should be

described by combining the lorentz condition with the lagrangian

l0(x) = 

1
4

f [0]
a f [0]

a

+

1
2

where

m 2aa(x)a

a (x) + l(x) +(cid:0)  c a(x)(cid:1)d

abcb(x) ,

in order to describe such free particles by an operator method, we replace (2.3) by

f [0]

a = aa   aa .

el0(x) = lgb(x) +

1
2

m 2aa(x)a

a (x) + l(x) +(cid:0)  c a(x)(cid:1)d

abcb(x) ,

where lgb(x) is a guptableuler lagrangian

lgb(x) = 

1
4

f [0]
a f [0]

a

2(cid:0)aa(cid:1)2

.

(2.3)

(2.4)

then we perform a canonical quantization with el0(x) and dene the corresponding hamiltonian opereator

h0 and eld opereators. moreover we have to choose the so-called physical states and dene a physical

state subspase according to lorentz condition. this subspase is spanned by all the physical eigen states

of h0 and can be formed in a similar method used in the guptableuler quantization although there are

dierences caused by the mass term of the gauge elds. we will simply call such a subspace as quasi-

gupta-bleuler or qgb subspace. if we can nd a total hamiltonian which determines the time evolution

of the heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions, it will be possible to construct a couple

of mappings to map each physical eigen state of h0 into an outgoing eigen state and an incoming eigen

state of the total hamiltonian. the latter eigen states can then be used to dene the scattering matrix.

in particular, these mappings can be expressed in terms of the time evolution operators u (0, ) in

the interaction picture dened by the total hamiltonian and h0, where u (0, ) describes the time

evolution from  to 0 and u (0, ) describes the evolution from + to 0. it will be seen that these

tentative ideas are correct. however, we will have to introduce the gauge xing term and construct

an appropriate operator expression for the generating functional for the renormalized green functions.

with the help of the the gauge xing term lgf =  1

2(cid:0)aa(cid:1)2

one can express (2.1) as

z [r][j, , , , ] = lim
0

z [r]



[j, , , , ] ,

where

z [r]



[j, , , , ] =

1

n z d[a, c, c, , ]expni(cid:0)ie + is(cid:1)o ,

where n is a constant to make z [r]



[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1, and

ie = i e +z d4xlgf (x) .

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

needles to say, quantities dened by using z [r]



[j, , , , ] depend on , but this parameter will often

be omitted.

let ez 0[j, , , , ] be the generating functional for the green functions dened by the eective

1

n0 z d[a, c, c, , ] ya,x

lagrangian el0, namely
ez 0[j, , , , ] =
ez 0[j, , , , ] = h0|texpniz d4x(cid:2)j 

where n0 is a contant to make ez0[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1. one thus has

 (aa(x)) expni(cid:0)z d4xel0(x) + is(cid:1)o ,

+ a(x)ca(x) + c a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3)o|0i ,

(2.8)

a (x)aa(x)

4

where aa(x), ca(x), a(x),    are eld operatos satisfying the usual equal time commutation or anti-

commutation rules and their time evolution are determined by h0. the state |0i is the eigen state of h0

belonging to the lowest eigegvalue (assigned to be zero). dene ehi so that

ie = z d4xehi (x) +z d4xel0(x) .

then one gets from (2.6)

ing the eld functions aa(x), ca(x), c a(x), a(x) and a(x) with

i(x)(cid:17) is a dierential operator obtained from ehi (x) by replac-
ia (x) respectively. the operator ehi appearing in the last line is obtained from the classical

quantity by replacing the eld functions with operatos aa(x), ca(x), c a(x), a(x) and a(x) and

and











then taking the normal products with respect to |0i. each of the two prorortion coecients in (4.10)
should make z [r]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1. it is evident that the time evolution of ehi is determined by h0:



ehi (t) = eih0t ehi (0)eih0t .
t expn  i z d4x ehi (x)o

is the time evolution opewrator u (, ) in the interction picture dened by h0 and the interaction

therefore, the operayor

r d3xehi (0), namely

and

t expn  iz d4x ehi (x)o = u (, ) ,
u (t, t0) = eih0teieh(tt0)eih0t0 ,
eh = h0 +z d3xehi (0) .
[j, , , , ]  h 0 |u (, 0)(cid:16)t expniz d4xhj 

a (x)ah

z [r]



it follows that (2.10) can be written as

+ c

a (x) +

a(x) + a(x)c h

a (x)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

the proportion coecient should make z [r]



[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1. the time evolution of the operators

ah

a,    are determined by eh:

ah

c h

h

a(t) = eiehtaa(0)eieht ,
a (t) = eiehtca(0)eieht ,
a(t) = eiehtc a(0)eieht ,
a (t) = eiehta(0)eieht ,
a(t) = eiehta(0)eieht .

c

h

h



therefore eh is the total hamiltonian operator and ah

heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions. thus (2.15) meams that the renormalized green

a (x), c

a(x), h

a (x) and 

h
a(x) stand for the

functions can be expressed as the vacuum expectations of the time ordered products of the heisenberg

operators of the renormalized eld functions. it should be emphasized that these eld operators satisfy

the usual equal time commutation or anticommutation rules.

iii. the scattering matrix

let |gbi stand for an arbitrary state in the qgb subspace. the states u (0, )|gbi are nor-

malized just like |gbi and one thus has

u (, 0)u (0, )|gbi = |gbi .

(3.1)

since u (0, )|gbi and u (0, )|gbi are the sum of the in-states and the out-states respectively and

each in-state (out-state) can be expanded as a sum of out-states (in-states), there exist states |

gbi and

|

gbi in the qgb subspace so that

u (0, )|gbi = u (0, )|

gbi ,

u (0, )|gbi = u (0, )|

gbi .

(3.2)

thus

|

gbi = u (, )|gbi ,

|

gbi = u (, )|gbi .

it follows that the operators u (, ) conserve invariant the qgb subspace. therefore we express

the elements of the scattering matrix as

sf i = lim
0

hf |u (, )|ii
h0|u (, )|0i

.

(3.3)

6

where |ii and |f i are within the qgb subspace and are the eigen states of h0.

next, from (3.1) and (3.2), one has

u (, )u (, )|gbi = u (, )u (, 0)u (0, )|

gbi

= u (, )|

gbi = u (, 0)u (0, )|gbi = |gbi .

similarly,

u (, )u (, )|gbi = |gbi .

these ensure the unitarity of the scattering matrix.

with the help of the time evolution operator in the interaction picture we can also dene the operators

of so-called asymptotic elds which will be denoted by aa,in(x), aa,out(x), a,in(x) and a,out(x),   .

these are free elds, and when t is very large each in-operator proportional to the heisenberg operator

of the renormalized eld function. actually each proportion coecent should be equal to 1 in order not

to destroy the usual equal time commutation or anticommutation rules. on the other hand when t is

very large each out-operator is equal to the heisenberg operator of the renormalized eld function. using

ah

a(x) = u (0, t)aa(x)u (t, 0) ,

h

a (x) = u (0, t)a(x)u (t, 0) ,

c h

a (x) = u (0, t)ca(x)u (t, 0) ,

and noticing that when |t| is large enough, u (0, t) and u (t, 0) are independent of t, one gets

aa,in(x) = u (0, )aa(x)u (, 0) ,

a,in(x) = u (0, )a(x)u (, 0) ,

aa,out(x) = u (0, )aa(x)u (, 0) ,

a,out(x) = u (0, )a(x)u (, 0) .

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

since the asymptotic elds are free ones, these are valid for any t. the formulae for the other elds are

similar.

if the instates and outstates are dened by

|0, in i =

|0, out i =

u (0, )|0i

ph 0|u (, )|0 i
ph 0|u (, )|0 i

u (0, )|0i

,

,

7

|i, in i =

|i, out i =

u (0, )|ii

,

ph 0|u (, )|0 i
ph 0|u (, )|0 i

u (0, )|ii

,

then (3.9) can be written as

sf i = lim
0

hf, out|i, ini = lim
0

h f, in|u (0, )u (, 0)|i, in i .

(3.8)

iv. an expression for the scattering matrix elements in terms

of the truncated renormalized green functions

in the following we will derive a formula to express the elements of the scattering matrix in terms of

the truncated renormalized green functions. dene the following operator

u (j, , , , ) = t(cid:16)u (, )expniz d4x(cid:2)j 

a (x)aa(x) + a(x)ca(x)

+c a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3)o(cid:17) .

(4.1)

we thus have

and

u (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) = u (, ) ,

h0|u (j, , , , )|0i/(cid:0)h0|u (, )|0i(cid:1) = z [r]



[j, , , , ] .

(4.2)

analogous to (2.10), we also have

u (j, , , , )

= exp(cid:26)iz d4xehi(cid:18) 

ij(x)

i(x)

(i)(x)

i(x)

where

eu (0)(j, , , , ) = t expniz d4x(cid:2)j 

a (x)aa(x) + a(x)ca(x)

+c a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3)o .

dene hi (x) and l

gf (x) so that

ie = r d4xhi (x) +r d4x(cid:8)lgf (x) + l0(x)(cid:9) ,

(i)(x)

ij(x)(cid:19)(cid:27) eu (0)(j, , , , ) .

(4.5)

noticed that h0|u (0)(j, , , , )|0i is proportional to the generating functional for the green func-

tions dened by the eective lagrangian l0 + lgf and the latter can be explicitly expressed as

where idab

(4.6)

(4.7)

as for the operator u (0)(j, , , , ), one has

where x [r][j, , , , ] stands for the generating functional for truncated renormalized green functions[8].

this is the formular we need. in the above manipulation, we have taken into account the fact that the

momenta of the particles in the initial or nal staes are on the mass shell and for such momenta the

renormalized full propagators become the free propagators.

v. concluding remarks

starting from the path integral of the generating functional for the renormalized green functions

with the renormalized eld functions as basical variables and using the unperturbed hamiltonian operator

that, under the lorentz condition, describes the free particles of the initial and nal states in scattering

processes, we have formed a satisfying operator description and found the total hamiltonian which

determine the time evolution of the heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions. with the

help of the time evolution operator u (, ) in the interaction picture and of the quasi-gupta-bleuler

subspace formed according to the lorentz condition, we have been able to easily explain the denition

and the unitarity of the scattering matrix and found a formular to express the matrix elements in terms

of the truncated renormalized green functions.

we have also briey described the asymptotic eld viewpoint based on our operator description. it

would be interesting to compare such a viewpoint with that of the traditional asymptotic theory[912].
