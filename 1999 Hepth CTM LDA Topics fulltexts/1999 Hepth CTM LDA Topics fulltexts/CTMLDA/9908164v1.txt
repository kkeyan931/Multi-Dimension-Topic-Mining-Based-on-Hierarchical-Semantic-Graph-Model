abstract we discuss the moduli space of at connections of yang-mills theories
formulated on t 3  r, with periodic boundary conditions. when the
gauge group is so(n  7), g2, f4, e6, e7 or e8, the moduli space
consists of more than one component.

1.

introduction

the vacuum equations for yang-mills theories on a 3torus with peri-
odic boundary conditions, f = 0, always allow a trivial solution where
the a are constant matrices in the cartan subalgebra (csa) of the
gauge group g. in n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills theories, the so-
lutions of the vacuum equations are of relevance for the computation of
the witten index tr(1)f [1] (which in this case is equal to the number
of quantum vacua). with the theory formulated on t 3  r, and assum-
ing that all solutions for the gauge eld are of the trivial form, witten
found tr(1)f = r + 1, with r the rank of g [1].

when formulated on r4, the theory has a u (1) chiral symmetry, bro-
ken to z2h by instantons (with h the dual coxeter number of g), and
further to z2 by gluino condensation, leaving h degenerate vacua [1].
hence, one nds tr(1)f = h. wittens index is assumed to be an in-
variant, so h should equal r + 1. this is the case for su (n ) and sp(n ),
but not for orthogonal or exceptional gauge groups.

the paradox was recently resolved, when it was shown that theories
with orthogonal or exceptional gauge groups on a 3torus, admit non-
trivial solutions to the vacuum equations for the gauge elds [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

taking these extra solutions into account one nds [2]

tr()f = h = xi

(ri + 1)

(0.1)

where the summation runs over all components of the moduli space,
and ri is the rank of the unbroken gauge group on component i. for
theories with g = su (n ) or sp(n ), the moduli space consists of only
one component of trivial solutions.

non-trivial flat connections

a at connection on t 3 is completely characterised by 3 holonomies

(wilson loops) around the non-trivial cycles of the torus:

k = p exp(cid:26)iz lk

0

ak(x)dxk(cid:27) ,

k = 1, 2, 3.

(0.2)

periodic boundary conditions mean that these commute in a simply con-
nected representation of the gauge group g. henceforth we will assume
g to be simply connected (as well as simple). constructing a at con-
nection is therefore equivalent to nding 3 commuting elements in the
group g. an obvious way to solve this is to exponentiate 3 elements of
the csa (this corresponds to a trivial at connection).

a new situation occurs if one picks a group element 1 as holonomy
that has a non-simply connected centraliser c(1). there are now two
options for the remaining two holonomies: when lifted to a simply con-
nected covering c(1) of c(1), they either commute, or they commute
up to a non-trivial element z of the centre of c(1), which is a lift of
the identity of c(1). the rst case is, up to conjugation, equivalent to
the trivial case. the second case is dierent. on the subtorus spanned
by the 2 and 3-direction, one has a case of t hoofts twisted boundary
conditions [7] in the gauge group c(1).

the subgroup of g commuting with all three holonomies has a rank
that is less than or equal to the rank of g. having found a set of com-
muting holonomies, one can nd a component of the moduli space by
deforming around the solution while requiring the holonomies to com-
mute. the rank of the unbroken group is constant over a component
of moduli space, and if solutions of dierent rank are found, the moduli
space should consist of dierent disconnected components.

as an example consider the smallest exceptional group g2. the g2-
algebra has an su(2)su(2) subalgebra, as is clear from the root diagram.
less immediate from the root diagram is that this is the algebra of an
so(4) = (su (2)  su (2))/z2 subgroup of g2 (the z2 is diagonal in

the su (2)  su (2) covering). this subgroup is non-simply connected,
independent of the g2 representation. as a rst holonomy one picks the
non-trivial centre element of so(4). this is an element of g2 which has
so(4) as its centraliser. for the remaining two holonomies pick elements
in the su (2)  su (2) covering of so(4) that commute up to the non-
trivial element of the diagonal z2, and project them to so(4). this
gives 3 commuting elements of g2. the centraliser of these holonomies
is a discrete group. hence this solution is on a dierent component of
the moduli space than the trivial one. it cannot be perturbed, therefore
this component of moduli space is an isolated point. all solutions to the
vacuum equations are either conjugate to this non-trivial one, or to a
trivial one, hence the moduli space of at g2-connections on t 3 consists
of 2 components [3].

for orthogonal groups so(n  7) (or rather the spin-groups, their
simply connected coverings) the moduli space also consists of two com-
ponents, but for so(n  9) the second component is no longer discrete
[2]. for the remaining exceptional groups the moduli space consists of
even more components. via embedding of g2 in these groups a second

4

component of the moduli space can be constructed. f4 and e6 have
an (su (3)n)/z3 subgroup (n = 2, 3 for f4 resp. e6) which allows two
non-conjugate non-trivial solutions to be constructed. this brings the
number of components for f4 and e6 to 4. the groups e7 and e8 allow
still more solutions, as described in [4, 5, 6]. in each case equation 0.1 is
satised. in the table, the components are ordered in a way that exhibits
the clockwise symmetry of [6].

toroidal compactification

the results for t 3 can be embedded in any n-torus with n  3. for
suciently big orthogonal groups, and the exceptional groups e8 also
new possibilities occur on higher dimensional tori [4, 5]. a full clas-
sication has not yet been done for these cases. the new solutions,
in particular those for the spin(32) and e8-groups, are of relevance
for toroidal compactication of the heterotic and type i string-theories
[2, 4]. the disconnectedness of the moduli space, and the rank reduction
show that they are not contained in the narain-compactication scheme
[8]. this is because narain-compactication assumes wilson lines with
gauge elds taking values in the csa, and the results presented here
show that this is not exhaustive. the models constructed with new so-
lutions for the gauge elds are similar to the chl-models [9], but allow
other possibilities for the reduction of the rank of the gauge group [4].
