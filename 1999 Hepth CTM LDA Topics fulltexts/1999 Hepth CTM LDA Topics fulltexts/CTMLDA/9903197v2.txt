a self-consistent random phase approximation (rpa) is proposed as an ef-
fective hamiltonian method in light-front field theory (lfft). we apply
the general idea to the light-front massive schwinger model to obtain a new

i. introduction

one of the most interesting aspects of light-front field theory (lfft) [1] is that it
shares many features with non-relativistic eld theory, due to the simple vacuum. it makes
the hamiltonian method sensible and thus lfft becomes an attractive framework for bound
state problems. to my knowledge, however, only very limited techniques which are common
in non-relativistic many-body problems have been used in the lf context, e.g., the tamm-
danco approximation [2] and a boson expansion method [3]. in order to fully exploit the
advantages of lfft, it is desirable to consider the possibility of the application of other
many-body techniques to lfft.

in this paper, we consider a kind of random phase approximation (rpa) applied to bound
state equations. in the usual rpa, only one-loop vacuum polarization diagrams (rings) are
summed up [4]. here we replace the vacuum polarization with the meson intermediate
states obtained by the bound state equation, as we did in a previous paper [5]. thus our
bound state equation is a self-consistent one.

the motivation for this approximation are two-fold: (1) the most popular method of
solving the bound state problems in lfft is hamiltonian diagonalization based on the
fock representation. in the crudest approximation, a meson is described as a q q valence
state. (in general, such a description is very good in lfft.) however it becomes rapidly
more dicult to include higher fock states. this diculty leads to the idea of eective
hamiltonians [6,7] which include the eects of higher fock states. a problem in this approach
is that the eective hamiltonians are obtained only perturbatively. in particular, it has not
been considered to include innitely many fock states. (2) in a previous paper [5] on the
theta vacuum in the massive schwinger model, we have shown that the vacuum polarization
eects are very important for the low-energy physics. it is therefore natural to consider such
eects in the calculations of meson states even in the absence of theta. another important
point in the previous work is that the vacuum polarization is approximately represented as
intermediate meson states obtained by the (two-body) bound state equation.

in order to make the idea as concrete as possible, we consider the massive schwinger
model as an example. in the next section, we review the perturbative tamm-danco trans-
formation [6] and apply it to the massive schwinger model. in sec. 3, we obtain the self-
consistent rpa bound state equation. in sec. 4, we numerically solve the equation. the
nal section is devoted to the conclusion and discussions.

ii. perturbative tamm-dancoff transformation

in order to make the bound state calculation tractable, it is necessary to make the hamil-
tonian more diagonal in particle number space. in a previous paper [6], we eliminate the
particle-number-changing interactions perturbatively by a similarity transformation. al-
though it was originally proposed to resolve the sector-dependent counterterm problem in
lf tamm-danco approximation [2], it is also useful in the massive schwinger model, where
no ultraviolet divergence occurs.

consider the hamiltonian h of the form,

h = h0 + w + gv

(2.1)

2

where (h0)mn = mmn. the interaction w does not change the particle number while
v does. the parameters  and g are to organize the perturbation theory. we will put
 = g = 1 at the end.

we eliminate the particle-number-changing interaction perturbatively by the following

similarity transformation,

hef f = eirheir

(2.2)

so that hef f is required to be diagonal in particle number. the operator r is expanded in
a power series of g and ,

to the second order in g, we obtain the following eective hamiltonian,

r = gr1 + g2r2 + gt1 +    .

hef f = h + g2h,
1

1

(h)mn =

2 xk (cid:18)

m  k

+

1

n  k(cid:19) vmkvkn.

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

although this eective hamiltonian is rather simple, it however gets very complicated
beyond the second-order in perturbation theory. furthermore, it is perturbative by construc-
tion and we do not have enough control over non-perturbative dynamics. for example, we do
not know how to treat the non-perturbative divergences which occur in the diagonalization,
except for the resummation by the use of the running coupling constant.

in the case of the massive schwinger model, however, there are no ultraviolet divergences
and, as is seen in the next section, we can generalize these interactions (at least partially)
to include some non-perturbative eects.

for the massive schwinger model, the eective interactions h in the q q sector may be

diagrammatically represented in fig. 1.

iii. a self-consistent rpa bound state equation for the

massive schwinger model

among these eective interactions, we are particularly interested in the coulomb inter-
action with vacuum polarization being included. in ref. [5], we showed that the vacuum
polarization eects are very important in low-energy physics.
it is therefore natural to
include this eect (i.e., charge shielding) in the bound state calculations. note that this
approximation is essentially equivalent to the so-called random phase approximation (rpa)
in many-body problems. here, however, we do a bit further. as we did in ref. [5], we re-
place the vacuum polarization with an approximate complete set of meson states. a simple
calculation gives the following replacement,

where gv (n) = r 1

0 dxn(x) and n(x) is the wave function of the n-th meson with mass
n. (see ref. [5] for the convention.) k and l (k and l) are longitudinal momenta of the
incoming (outgoing) fermion and antifermion respectively. see fig. 2. note that we have
summed the geometric series of the vacuum polarization [8].
with this replacement, we obtain the following bound state equation (in units of e/),

is the screening factor. eq. (3.2) is our extension of the t hooft-bergkno equation [9],

((x)  (y))

.

(3.4)

1. the screening factor s depends not only on the momentum transfer (x  y) but on
the individual momenta of the fermion and the antifermion. the x-dependent terms
do not scale in a simple way. it makes the analysis of this equation very complicated.

2. the equation (3.2) is a self-consistent one, so that we should solve it iteratively as
we do in the next section.
it is important to note that, although we started with
the two-body bound state equation (3.4), our bound state equation (3.2) contains the
eects of innitely many fock states because of this self-consistency.

3. although the equation (3.2) is a self-consistent one, it is not the usual hartree-fock
approximation in which only the wave function of the specic state is included. our
equation requires the information on all the meson states. it is not the usual rpa ei-
ther, in which only the perturbative vacuum polarization diagrams (rings) are summed
and the self-consistency is not required.

4. 0 < s < 1. of course it physically means that the electric charge is screened due to
the vacuum polarization. the eective charge reduces in a momentum dependent way.

5. the screening factor is included not only for the usual coulomb term but also the

so-called self-induced inertia term,

 z 1

0

dy

1

(x  y)2! (x).

(3.5)

this is necessary in order to ensure the positivity of the eigenvalue 2. by multiplying
(x) and integrating over x from 0 to 1, we obtain

4

2z 1

0

dx|(x)|2 = m2z 1
2 z 1

0

0

s({n},{n}, m, x, y).

(3.6)

since the screening factor s is positive, the eigenvalue 2 must be positive. if we did
not include the screening factor in the self-induced inertia term, we would not have
had the positivity of 2.

6. in the zero-momentum-transfer limit (x  y)  0, the screening factor becomes mo-

mentum independent, i.e.,

s({n},{n}, m, x, y)  (1 +xn

|gv (n)|2

n )1

2

.

(3.7)

the factor pn |gv (n)|2/2

n is the one we encountered in ref. [5].

7. the wave function (x) for the t hooft-bergkno equation (3.4) has a denite meaning
that it is the two-body amplitude with respect to the free fermion and antifermion.
the wave function (x) for our equation (3.2) does not have such a clear meaning
because it contains the contribution from the higher fock states. roughly speaking,
however, it could be considered as the two-body amplitude with respect to the dressed
(constituent) fermion and antifermion.

iv. numerical solution

in this section, we numerically solve our bound state equation (3.2). unfortunately,
however, we are unable to nd a useful set of basis functions [10] which enable us to calculate
the hamiltonian matrix elements analytically.
instead, we use a naive discretization of
the equation. we do not claim that the numerical results we present in this section is
accurate. rather we emphasize that our equation gives a reasonably small correction to the
corresponding solution of the t hooft-bergkno equation and therefore our equation could
be a starting point of further improvements.

the method is extremely simple. we discretize the range of x, [0, 1], into n + 1 pieces,
and impose the boundary condition on the wave function, (0) = (1) = 0. thus our
equation becomes an n  n matrix eigenvalue equation. we rst solve it with s  1, and
then use the result to calculate the screening factor for the next calculation. in this way, we
iteratively solve the equation until the solution becomes self-consistent.

most of the calculations were done with n = 2000. we stop the iteration when the

dierence of the subsequent wavefunctions becomes less than  = 1.0  1012,

z 1

0

dx|new(x)  old(x)|2 < .

(4.1)

a typical number of iterations is 4. in general, the convergence is slower for smaller fermion
masses.

5

first we compare the results with those without vacuum polarization. fig. 3 shows how
the meson mass calculated iteratively with the new bound state equation deviates from
the one obtained with the t hooft-bergkno equation. we see that there is systematic
improvement, which is almost independent of how ne the equations are discretized. for
small fermion masses m <
 0.2, because of the singular behavior of the wavefunction at
the edges, even the result without vacuum polarization depends on n, and therefore the
results there should not be trusted. see fig. 4 for the copmarison with the result obtained
by the basis function method [10] which is accurate for small fermion masses. we however
emphasize that the modication due to vacuum polarization does not ruin the spectrum but
leads to a reasonable correction. this is not so trivial because the modication is essentially
nonlinear and depends all the eigenvalues as well as the eigenstates. this, together with the
valence dominance in lf massive schwinger model [11], gives a consistent picture that the
modication with vacuum polarization correctly reects the (small) eects of higher fock
states.

next we compare the wavefunctions. as seen in fig. 5, the meson wavefunction for the

new equation is less singular at the edges (x  0 and x  1).
as we emphasized earlier [8], apparently we should not sum up the geometrical series
in the calculations without
of vacuum polarization. here we did it as a regularization.
summing up the geometrical series, we numerically found that a state whose wavefunction
is odd under x  1 x becomes the lightest one when the fermion mass is small. this seems
to be because

1

xy

1

n + (xy)2m2
2

(1x)(1y)




(4.2)

becomes very small when m  0. we are unable to give any positive interpretation of such
a lightest state with wavefunction being odd under x  1  x, and thus think that it is an
artefact. in fact, the odd lightest state occurs for m <
 0.1, where the results should not
be trusted because, as we remarked earlier, the discretization cannot represent the correct
endpoint behavior of the wave function, which is very important for the correct spectrum.
we emphasized that the new bound state equation contains the information on all the
meson states. it is however dominated by the lowest meson state and eectively reduces
to a much simpler one. namely, we numerically nd that the sum in the screening factor
(3.3) is strongly dominated by the rst term. this fact reduces the cpu time considerably.
in table i, we compare the reduced calculation with the full one.

v. summary and discussions

in this paper, we developed a self-consistent rpa as a new eective hamiltonian method
in lfft. the method was applied to the massive schwinger model and a generalization of
the t hooft-bergkno equation was obtained, which eectively includes the contributions
from innitely many fock states. we numerically solved it and found that the modication,
i.e., the inclusion of vacuum polarization, leads to reasonable small corrections. we hope that
this new bound state equation becomes a starting point of more elaborate approximations.
in the following, we would like to discuss several aspects about the new bound state

equation.

6

it has been shown that the rst-oder coecient m1 of the expansion of the meson mass

squared in terms of the fermion mass,

2(m) = 1 + m1m + m2m2 +    ,

(5.1)

cannot be improved even if the variational space is systematically extended [12]. later,
dalley suggested that the endpoint behavior of the wave function may change if the eects
of higher fock states correctly. (it has been assumed that the endpoint behavior is solely
determined by the two-body sector [10,12].) because the coecient is closely related to
the endpoint behavior, it is hoped that the so-called 2% discrepancy will disappear when
the correct endpoint behavior is taken into account. since our new bound state equation
contains the eects of higher fock states, it is natural to ask if the dalleys suggestion is
correct quantitatively. for small fermion masses, it looks legitimate to approximate the
screening factor in the following way,

s({n},{n}, m, x, y)  s  (1 + |gv (1)|2

2

1 )1

,

(5.2)

where 1 =  is the meson mass and gv (1) = r 1

becomes

0 dx(x), and the bound state equation

2(x) =

m2

x(1  x)

(x) +z 1

0

dx(x) + sz 1

0

dy

((x)  (y))

(x  y)2

.

we estimate the coecient m1 by using the ansatz

(5.3)

(5.4)

(x) = x(1  x),

2(1 + o(m)), and nd that m1 = 2/6 = 2.56510 which should be compared
and s = 1
with the value for the t hooft-bergkno equation, 2/3 = 3.62760 and the correct value,
2e = 3.56125. although it is considerably too small, it is important that it shifts from the
value of the t hooft-bergkno equation. it is conceivable that the approximation employed
here is too naive and a more elaborate calculation would give a much better value. in fact,
the above approximation (the limit (5.2)) is not legitimate, because for nite m, however
tiny, the term with the fermion mass is not negligible for x < 1/m2. at present, we are
unable to extract any useful information on the endpoint behavior because of this subtlety.
the numerical results in the previous section may suggest that the eects of higher fock
states would solve the 2% discrepancy, though the present numerical method is too crude
to correctly calculate the meson mass in the small fermion mass region.

although we included the eects of vacuum polarization as an eective interaction, from
the similarity transformation point of view, there are other kind of eective interactions. to
ensure the invariance of the eigenvalues (meson masses) under the addition of eective
interactions, it is necessary for the transformation to be unitary. that is, we have to add
other interactions in fig. 1 too.
in this paper, we assumed that the eects of the other
interactions are small. but this is a cheat: the self-energy diagram with vacuum polarization
is infrared divergent. presumably, such infrared divergences cancel in the calculation of
the meson spectrum. (some authors also assumed the cancellation [14].) we are however

7

unable to pin point how such cancellation occurs. note that the cancellation of infrared
divergences would be dierent from that in scattering processes.
in qed, for example,
because positronium is a neutral particle and has a nite size, it cannot couple to very
soft photons, which play an important role in the cancellation of infrared divergences in
scattering processes.

finally, we give some comments on the outlook.

1. it is of course interesting to extend the present formulation to realistic four-dimensional

models. we are now working on this direction.

2. it is interesting to note again that the new equation is a self-consistent one from the
spontaneous-symmetry-breaking point of view. we hope that a similar setting would
leads to a useful framework for the vacuum problem in lfft.

3. the vacuum polarization inside the meson is also important in the presence of theta.

it solves several puzzles concerning theta. the work is now in progress.

fig. 4. the limitation of the naive discretization. the results with the naive discretization are
compared with those obtained by basis function calculation for the t hooft-bergkno equation,
the latter being considered to be accurate for small fermion masses. the naive discretization does
not produce accurate values for small fermion masses.

fig. 5. the comparison of the wavefunctions obtained for the (old) t hooft-bergkno equa-
tion and those for the new equation for m = 0.2 and m = 1.0. the wavefunctions for the new
equation are less singular at the edges for small fermion masses.

tables

table i. comparison of the reduced calculation with the full one. the mass of the lowest
meson state is shown. in the reduced calculation, we take only the rst term in the sum in the
screening factor (3.3). the calculations are done with the naive discretization explained in sec. iv
with n = 2000.
