(38) altogether, large cutos, get l-independent result b = (n 1)2 42a4 ( x0 8 + 65 2048 ), x0 . (39) extract nondispersive part expression: b(nondispersive part) = (n 1)2 4a4 65 2048 . (40) compared second order contribution nondispersive force obtained previously eq.(24): f nondisp(2nd order) = (n 1)2 64a4 ( 65 128 ) xl=1 0 = (n 1)2 4a4 65 2048 . (41) expressions (40) (41) seen equal. brings us following important conclusion: perform dispersive calculation surface force, second order, nd term independent cuto. term precisely equal second order contribution within calculation nondispersive outset. second case zeta- function regularization employed, rst case not. 13 consider next zeroth order term (33). performing integration z get (n 1)2 42a4 (n 1)2 42a4 = 2z x0/ 0 z2t6(z)dz . (42) xl=1 xl=1 able give order-of-magnitude analysis physically meaningful part divergent expression. note rst, however, follow- ing point: take nondispersive limit, x0 = . last term (42) survives get, employing zeta function regularization, a(nondispersive part) = (n 1)2 4a4 1 16 xl=1 2 = (n 1)2 4a4 1 64 . (43) precisely expression (31), serves corollary dispersive calculation. return dispersive case, estimate contribution sum (42) low moderate values l, x0. x0, see two rst terms (42) negligible comparison third term. moreover, = x0 two rst terms compensate other. consequently may write a|x0 (n 1)2 42a4 xx0 2 8 arctan x0 . (44) variation factor arctan(x0/) moderate; decreases /2 small , /4 x0 = . estimate purposes may replace arctan(x0/) constant c, c lies interval /4 c /2. sum (44) becomes simple evaluate, since get x01/2 xl=1 2 = 1 3 x3 0 + 1 2 x2 0 + 1 6 x0 1 4 , a|x0 = (n 1)2 42a4 c 8 ( 1 3 x3 0 + 1 2 x2 0 + 1 6 x0 1 4 ). (45) (46) natural argue above, connection (40) (41). may thus associate x0- independent part (46) 14 nondispersive surface force, calculated according zeroth order uniform asymptotic expansion. actually, equate x0 - independent part (arising last term (46)) expression (31), obtain c = /2. precisely value c corresponding small values , according discussion above. may thus conclude nondispersive part force, least far leading term concerned, associated low angular momenta l . x0 included, (46) predicts usual physical circumstances strong, repulsive force. instance, take c = /2 x0 = 100, nd (46) 106 large nondispersive second order (or fourth order) force given (30). large dierence expected quite important, practice. eclatant example think sonoluminescence eect . briey return point conclusion section. result (46) derived assumption low moderate nondimensional frequencies, x0. appreciable contribution higher frequencies also? think so, reason being, explained above, photons > 0 see medium. physically speaking safe truncate l summation x0 adopt (46) reasonable order-of-magnitude estimate leading dispersive term. total surface force density f thus estimated adding expressions (46) (39). finally mention following alternative method handling di- vergent sum a, may appear mathematically convenient. method consists adding subtracting weakly divergent sum representing frequency region > x0. starting (42) see amounts writing = (n 1)2 42a4 xl=1  + + (n 1)2 42a4 x3 0 3 1 , xl=1 (47) chosen let sums l extra terms run 1 innity. advantage writing way rst two sums (47) nite, explicit control divergence second sum. let rst sum denoted a(nite). making numerical calculation expression lower upper 15 limits x0 = 100 x0 = 1000, get approximately a(f inite) (n 1)2 42a4 (cid:26) 1.7 106, 2.4 109, x0 = 100 x0 = 1000 (48) graphical representation a(nite) versus x0 shows variation roughly linear actual frequency region. exploiting fact, truncating second sum (47) l = x0, arrive following estimate a: (n 1)2 42a4 "x3 0 3 1 x0 xl=1 (266.5 x0 100 264.8)106# , (49) valid 100 x0 1000. seen, fact, structure (49) dierent structure previous estimate (46). advantage (49) comparison (46), course, appears extra constant c estimated separately. 5 conclusion nal remarks physical model considered paper compact dilute spher- ical ball, surrounded vacuum. dispersion relation material n(i) = n = const imaginary frequency lower ultraviolet cuto frequency 0 whereas n(i) = 1 higher . simple dispersion relation: know general grounds n(i), closely related so-called generalized susceptibility, real positive imaginary frequency axis decreases monotonically towards 1 (cf., instance, ). however, serious restric- tion may well imagine n(i) instead endowed small negative slope < 0. nondimensional cuto x0 = 0a, radius ball. typical physical conditions, radius lies interval 1m 10m, expect 100 x0 1000. basic green function formalism (sect. 2) taylor expanded (n 1) second order, expanded 1/ fourth order ( = l + 1/2). maple v program proves eective tool. surface force density f constructed taking dierence be- tween radial maxwell stress tensor components two sides boundary r = . alternatively, f found integral radial component volume force density f across boundary. general 16 expression f given (1), meaning various terms dis- cussed. rst, usual conditions important, term (the abraham - minkowski term) considered paper nondispersive force calculated sect.3. formally, case treated setting x0 = , regularizing divergent sums using riemann zeta function. working order 1/4 uniform asymptotic expansion, nondispersive force given (27) (30). slightly accurate value given (32). force repulsive. emphasize f nondisp physical force; expression merely formal outcome less arbitrary regularization procedure. interest note that, addition green function approach above, recently developed also two alternative proce- dures lead results supporting statement: first, one may consider problem microscopic point view calculate mutual van der waals energy molecules compact sphere. done milton ng . van der waals energy two molecules v = b/r7, b positive constant. integrating sphere one nds divergent expression regularized, conveniently means dimensional regularization. nite remaining part energy becomes e = ( 1)2 23 1536 (50) associating van der waals energy e surface force f via relation f = (1/4a2)e/a, nd numerical result f = f nondisp eq.
