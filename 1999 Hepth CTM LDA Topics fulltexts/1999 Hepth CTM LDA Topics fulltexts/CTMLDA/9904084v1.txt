abstract

we look at and compare two dierent methods developed earlier for inducing

gauge invariances in systems with second class constraints. these two methods, the

batalin-fradkin method and the gauge unxing method, are applied to a number of

systems. we nd that the extra eld introduced in the batalin-fradkin method can

actually be found within the original phase space itself.

1 introduction

in recent years there have been a number of papers on gauge invariances in systems with
second class constraints. basically this involves unravelling, using the language of con-
staints, gauge symmetries hidden in such systems. by doing so it has sometimes been
possible to obtain a deeper and more illuminating view of these systems.

in unravelling such hidden symmetries, the basic idea is that the original system is a
gauge xed version of a certain gauge theory; the latter reverts to the former under certain
gauge xing conditions. the advantage in having a gauge theory lies in the fact that other
gauges can also be considered. further it is possible to get more than one gauge theory for
the same second class constrained system.

two methods have been suggested to make this conversion of second class theories into
gauge theories. one method, based originally on the idea of faddeev and shatashvili [1], is
now called the batalin - fradkin method [2] and is formulated in an enlarged phase space.
the other method, based on the idea of mitra-rajaraman [3] is what we call gauge unxing
[4], and does not use any enlarged phase space. rather it connes itself to the phase space
of the original second class system.

even though these methods look very dierent in their formulations, when they are
applied to many systems like chern - simons theory, chiral schwinger model, etc., the re-
sults are basically the same, implying that as far as these examples are concerned, the two

methods are essentially equivalent. in what follows we illustrate this equivalence for three
such examples. we compare the results of the two methods for these systems. any conclu-
sions arising out of such a comparison might be illuminating when the formal equivalence
is considered. such a formal equivalence will be considered separately.

in section 2 we review the two methods, and look at specic systems in section 3. we

conclude in section 4.

2 the formalisms

we consider a nite dimensional system in phase space with co-ordinates qi and conjugate
momenta pi (i = 1, 2, . . . n). the system has two second class constraints,

q1(q, p)  0,

q2(q, p)  0

(1)

dening a constraint surfacep2. due to their second class nature, the 2 2 antisymmetric

matrix e whose elements emn are poisson brackets among the qs,

eab(q, p) = {qa, qb}

a, b = 1, 2

(2)

is invertible everywhere, even on the surfacep2 . the canonical hamiltonian is hc and the

total hamiltonian is

where the multipliers 1, 2 are determined on the surface p2 by demanding consistency

of the two constraints with respect to h.

h = hc + 1q1 + 2q2,

(3)

2.1 batalin - fradkin (bf) method

as mentioned earlier, the idea behind this method [1, 2] is to enlarge the phase space by
including new variables. since we have taken the number of second class constraints here
to be two, we introduce two variables a(a = 1, 2). the enlarged phase space (q, p, ) has
the basic poisson brackets

{qi, pj} = i

j

{a, b} = ab

(4)

with all other poisson brackets zero. the antisymmetric 2  2 matrix ab is a constant
matrix, unspecied for the present.

the rst class constraints are obtained as functions in this extended phase space. since
we had initially two second class constraints, there will now be two rst class constraints,
given in general by

eqa(qi, pi, a) = qa +
eqa(qi, pi, 0) = q(0)

xm=1

a = qa

2

q(m)

a

,

q(m)
a  (a)m

(5)

where the second line gives the boundary condition. the terms of various orders in the

expansion for eqa are obtained by demanding that the eqa are strongly rst class,

{eqa, eqb} = 0.

for instance for the rst order this requirement gives

eab + xaccdxdb = 0

which can be satised, using (4), if we write and substitute

q(1)

a = xab(q, p)b,

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

in (6) and consider terms upto rst order. for many systems, such as the ones we consider
in the next section, the higher order terms are all zero. it must be noted that there is an
inherent arbitrariness in the choice of the a and the coecients xab. this choice may be
exploited to advantage.

to get gauge invariant observables, we note that relevant quantities of the original
second class system in general are not gauge invariant with respect to the new rst class
constraints. they are made gauge invariant by modifying them in the extended phase
space. in particular the gauge invariant hamiltonian [2] can be written in general as

fh = h +

h (m)

xm=1

h (m)  (a)m

and the terms of various orders are obtained by demanding that

{ h, eqm} = 0.

a similar procedure is followed to obtain other gauge invariant quantities also [2]. we
nally remark that eqn. (7) can always be written so in the case of 2 constraints. for more
than 2 second class constraints, this has to be taken as an assumption, which need not hold
in the very general case. in a sense, the xab can be called the square root of the matrix
e [2].

2.2 the gauge unxing method

this method [3, 4], in contrast to the bf method, makes no enlargement of the phase
space. rather, since the number of second class constraints is even (we consider here only
bosonic constraints), only half of these constraints are chosen to form a rst class subset,
and the other half as the corresponding gauge xing subset. this latter subset is discarded,
retaining only the rst class subset, and so we have a gauge theory.

3

in a general system, getting a rst class subset is a non-trivial issue [4]; this might
be possible only under certain conditions. however in the case of only two second class
constraints (which we consider here) the rst class constraint can always be chosen.

for instance, we can choose q1 as our rst class constraint, and q2 as its gauge xing

constraint. we redene, using (2),

q1   = e 1

12 q1

q2 = 

(11)

and no longer consider the  as a constraint. the gauge invariant hamiltonian and other
physical quantities are obtained by dening the projection operator

ip = : e  :

(a)  {, a}

(12)

and operating ip on any phase space function a. there is an ordering prescribed for the
action of ip ; the  is always outside the poisson bracket in the expansion of the exponential.
the action of ip on relevant quantities gives the gauge invariant quantities.

it must be noted that even in this method, there is an inherent arbitrariness; either
of the two second class constraints can be chosen to be rst class. the two choices dene
two dierent projection operators, and the gauge theories so constructed will in general be
dierent. this arbitrariness can be exploited to advantage.

3 examples

3.1 chiral schwinger model

this well known anomalous gauge theory [5, 6, 7] involves chiral fermions coupled to a
u(1) gauge eld in 1 + 1 dimensions. classically the theory has gauge invariance, but this
is lost upon quantisation. we look at its bosonised version, the advantage being that the
corresponding classical theory itself has no gauge invariance. we have

l =

e2a2


(13)

where g = diag(1,1), 01 = 10 = 1 and  is the regularisation parameter. the theory
is gauge non-invariant for all values of . we consider the case  > 1.

the canonical hamiltonian density is

(14)

where 1 = f 01 = 0a1  1a0, and  = 0 + e(a0  a1) are the momenta conjugate
to a1 and  respectively. the constraints are

q1 = 0 = 0
q2 = 11 + e2(  1)a0 + e(1 + ) + e2a1 = 0

dening a constraint surface p2 . these are of the second class,

e12 = {q1(x), q2(y)} = e2(  1)(x  y).

(15)

(16)

following the bf method [6], the phase space is extended by introducing two elds
1, 2, with poisson bracket relations of the form (4). to get the rst class constraints (5)
and (8), we recall that there is a natural arbitrariness in choosing the matrices ab and
xab. this allows the choice

 =

0 1

1 0  (x  y)

x(x, y) = e  1

1 0

0 1  (x  y)

(17)

this choice allows the two new elds to form a canonically conjugate pair. the terms
beyond the rst order in the expansion (5) are all zero. we then get

eqm = qm + e  1m,

m = 1, 2

(18)

which, using (16) and (17), can be veried to be strongly rst class.

using similar arguments the gauge invariant hamiltonian for the choice (17) is

where hc is the canonical hamiltonian. this fhbf has zero pbs with the rst class con-

straints (18).

coming to the gauge unxing (gu) method [7], we reiterate that no new eld need be
introduced. the rst class constraint is taken to be just one of the two existing constraints.
we choose, after a rescaling

so that the relevant constraint surface is p1 dened by  = 0. the gauge xing-like con-

straint is  = 0, and is discarded (that is unxed). to get the gauge invariant hamiltonian

introduction of an extra (canonical) pair of elds, while the other doesnt need this. in
both cases extra terms are needed to make the original hamiltonian gauge invariant. for

the action sbf above is just the gauge invariant version for the chiral schwinger model.
as is well known, this action was rst obtained by merely adding the (schwinger) terms in
the variable 1 to the original bosonised action (13). it has also been obtained using other
arguments. in the batalin-fradkin approach, these schwinger terms and 1 come up due
to the extension of the phase space.

coming to the hamiltonian fhgu of the gauge unxing method, we have

zgu = z d(a, , , , ) eisgu
sgu = z dxdth0 a0 + 1 a1 +    fhgu  i ,

we see that on making the replacement 0 = e  11 in (25), we get the same result

as in the batalin-fradkin case (23). this is achieved here by introducing no extra elds.
the extra eld of the bf method is found here within the original phase space. further the

schwinger terms are the same in both cases. we also note that the extra termr (cid:16) (2)2

which comes upon comparing the hamiltonians in (19) and (21) have been integrated away
in the path integral (23).

q1 = 0(x)  0,

which together dene the surface p2 in the phase space. their second class nature is due

to the mass term in the lagrangian. the matrix e of eqn. (2) is here

e =

0 m2
m2

0  (x  y),

whose determinant is non-zero everywhere.

(29)

using the batalin - fradkin method [9], we introduce an extra canonical pair of elds
 and , with {(x), (y)} = (x  y). as earlier, transformations in this extended phase
space modify the constraints (28) to

eq1 = q1 + m2

7

eq2 = q2 + ,

(30)

(27)

(28)

which, using (29) can be seen to be strongly rst class. the form for these constraints
corresponds to the choice of  and  as a canonically conjugate pair.

the corresponding gauge invariant hamiltonian is

with respect to which the rst class constraints satisfy



fhbf = hc +z d3x  2

m2

{eq2,fhbf} = 0

(31)

(32)

(34)

on the other hand, in the gauge unxing method, there is only one rst class constraint,

one of the two in (28). for our purposes we choose this constraint to be

 =

1
m2 (ii + m2a0)  0,

(33)

and throw away the other  = 0. the relevant constraint surface is dened by   0. the
hc of (27) does not have zero pb with this  on this new surface, and hence is not gauge
invariant. using a projection operator of the form (12) on hc we get the gauge invariant
hamiltonian

fhgu = hc +z d3x(cid:20)iai

i (cid:21) .

note the similarity between the hamiltonians fhbf and fhgu . indeed, apart from the term
2
r d3x
2m2 in (31) the two hamiltonians are the same if we make the identication  = m2.

we look at path integral quantisations. for the fhbf , we have
zbf = z d(o, a0, i, ai, , , 1, 2) eisbf
sbf = z d4x"0 a0 + i ai + 
  hc 

(i)2 + m2iai  1eq1  2eq2# ,

where 1 and 2 are undetermined lagrange multipliers. after some redenitions of elds

the last line gives just the stuckelberg gauge invariant action [8]. the  eld is called
the stuckelberg scalar, which was originally introduced by stuckelberg directly into the
proca lagrangian to make it gauge invariant. thus in the bf formalism, the extra eld
introduced is the stuckelberg scalar.

on the other hand, the path integral for the gauge unxed hamiltonian fhgu is

zgu =z d(a, , ) exp iz d4x (cid:16)0 a0 + i ai fhgu  (cid:17) ,

(37)

the bf method which was recognised earlier as the stuckelberg scalar corresponds here to
 0
m2 , which was already present in the phase space of the original second class constrained

theory. this suggests that the extra eld need not be introduced at all.

3.3 abelian chern-simons theory

this 2 + 1 dimensional theory [4, 11] consists of a complex eld interacting with an abelian
chern-simons eld. the theory is described by the lagrangian density

l = (d)(d) +

with d = (  ia), g = diag (1,1,1). and , ,  = 0, 1, 2. we also have

hc =z d2x(cid:20)(~ + i ~a)  (~  i ~a) +  + a0(j0 
with  =  + ia0,  =   ia0, and j0 = i(  ).

with the rst line showing the rst class constraints. the second line gives the second class
constraints of the theory,

{q1(x), q2(y)} = (x  y).

(42)

instead of the canonical hamiltonian (40), we will consider the total hamiltonian which
guarantees the time consistency of q1 and q2 (on the surface dened by both q1 and q2),

h =z d2x{hc + u1q1 + u2q2}

we now get the gauge theory using the batalin-fradkin method [11]. the new variables
1, 2 serve to enlarge the phase space, and have the poisson brackets (4). in this enlarged

we apply the gauge unxing method [4] to this theory. we redene

we see that apart from the termr d2x (1)2 (and those proportional to the eq1 and eq2
in (45)), the hamiltonians fhbf and fhgu are the same. however this extra term can be
easily introduced in the hamiltonian fhgu , since it is basically proportional to the gauge
by making use of these extra terms in fhgu , we can see this equivalence using the path

integral too. after various redenitions and integrations, we get the nal gauge invariant
action to be

we have deliberately omitted the subscripts bf and gu here, in order to emphasize that
the same result is obtained for both the methods. the bf action is as given above, with
the terms in the 2 as extra terms in order to give the new gauge symmetry. in the gu
result the action is the same as in (48), with the 2 being replaced by the . it may also
be noted that the action in its nal form is not manifestly lorentz invariant.

4 conclusion

in conclusion, we have seen that for the three systems above, the two vastly dierent
methods described in section 2 unearth essentially the same gauge theories. this is seen

10

both classically and using the path integral.

in both methods, extra terms have to be

introduced in the hamiltonian; in the fhbf case these terms involve new elds, whereas in
fhgu these terms are found in the original phase space. thus, at least as far as the above

three systems are concerned, one need not really introduce a totally new variable. in other
words to get the hidden gauge symmetries one need not look outside the original system,
they are present within the original system itself.

when their second class constraint structures are considered, the above three systems
are simple ones. the e matrices of (2) involve only constants, so that getting the gauge
invariant hamiltonians is quite easy; the new hamiltonians will have a nite number of
terms. this situation however need not be seen for other systems. sometime the gauge
invariant hamiltonians may be in series form, in which case it has to be seen if closed form
expressions are possible. it is to be seen if the two methods are equivalent in such more
general cases also. this question is being currently looked into.

in our analysis above, the three systems involved only two second class constraints.
it was mentioned earlier that in the gauge unxing case, this does not pose any problem
in choosing the rst class constraint; either one of the two can be chosen, to give more
than one gauge theory. however in the batalin-fradkin case, both constraints are to be
converted into rst class; but even here this conversion is always possible, the reason being
the square root matrix x of (8) can always be obtained from the e matrix.

on the other hand, in the case of more than two second class constraints, we may have
additional problems; in the gu method, the choice of the rst class subset becomes non-
trivial, and in the bf method nding the square root x matrix becomes non-trivial. but
once the rst class subset (or x matrix) is found, then the new gauge symmetry is dened.
in this regard we mention that in the gu method, a certain assumption regarding the e
matrix of (2) has to be used to obtain the rst class subset.
