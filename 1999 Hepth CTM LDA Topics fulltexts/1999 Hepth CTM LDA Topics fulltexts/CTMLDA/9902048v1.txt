abstract

a gauge invariant formulation for the massive axion is considered.
the axion acquires mass through a topological term which couples a
(pseudo)scalar and a third rank antisymmetric tensor. the dual, local
and canonical equivalences with the non-gauge invariant proposal are
established. the supersymmetric version is constructed.

in four dimensions a massless (pseudo)scalar eld: the axion, is dual to
the antisymmetric eld bmn (only if derivative couplings are considered, so
massive terms are excluded). this fact is a particular case of the general
duality between p and d  p  2 forms in d dimensions. in this sense, since
non-perturbative eects break the local peccei-quinn symmetry, as a mech-
anism to give mass to the axion eld, the duality between a massive axion
and an antisymmetric eld was considered an enigma until two independent
approaches [1], [2] were developed recently. in the present, it is understood
that, taking into account non-perturbative eects, the usual duality between
a massless scalar eld and an antisymmetric eld bmn is not broken, but
replaced by the duality between a massive scalar  and a massive antisym-
metric eld cmnp. an early attempt to undestand this duality was considered
in reference[3]. a characteristic feature of this duality is the lost of abelian
gauge invariance for the antisymmetric eld.

in this article, we will show that a gauge invariant theory, which involves
a topological coupling and considered several years ago [4] in the context of
the u(1) problem, is locally equivalent to the non gauge invariant proposal.
this equivalence is similar to what happen in three dimensions for massive

1

topologically and self-dual theories [5] and the proca and massive topolog-
ically gauge invariant theories in four dimensions [6]. at the end, we will
construct a supersymmetric formulation for this model.

an illustrative model for the massive axion is given by the following

master action[3] [7]

i =<

1
2

vmvm + mvm 

m22 >,

1
2

(1)

where vm is a vector eld and  is a scalar eld (<> denotes integration
in four dimensions). eliminating the eld vm through its equation of mo-
tion: vm = m, the action for a massive scalar is obtained, while using the
equation of motion of the scalar eld  ( = 1

m2 mvm), we have

iv =

1
2

< vmvm +

1
m2 (mvm)2 > .

(2)

the propagator corresponding to the eld vm is mn  kmkn
k2+m2 , which is just
equal to those discussed in [1]. a simple way to show the duality, rely on
introducing the dual of the vector eld vm = 1
3! mmnpqcnpq in the action iv,
yielding the master action

im 1 =< 

1

2.3!

m2c mnpcmnp +

1
3!

mmnpqmcnpq

m22 > .

(3)

from which the duality is easily infered. to see this, we can use its equations
of motion

mc mnp  mnpqq = 0,

m 

1
3!

mnpqmcnpq = 0,

(4)

(5)

to eliminate cmnp (or ), thus obtaining the action for a massive scalar eld
(or the massive antisymmetric eld cmnp). in anycase, there is not gauge
invariance at all. we can ask whether there really exist a gauge invariant
theory compatible with a massive term for the axion eld. the answer is
possitive and the action is

im 2 =< 

1
2

mm 

1

2.4!

gmnpqgmnpq 

m
3!

mnpqcmnpq >,

(6)

where gmnpq  mcnpq  ncmpq + pcmnq  qcmnp is the eld strength
associated with the antisymmetric eld cmnp. this action was considered

2

previously in ref [4] as a generalization to four dimensions of the schwinger
model in two dimensions. this action, as we will see, is locally equivalent
to im 1, describing the propagation of a massive (pseudo)scalar excitation: a
massive axion. note that the coupling term is an extension of the usual bf
term. the action is invariant, up to a surface term, under the abelian gauge
transformations

cmnp = mnp + npm + pmn,

 = 0.

(7)

and under the global transformation:  = constant. the equations of
motion for im 2 can be written, suggestively, as

mnpqq(mcmnp  mnprr) = 0,

mnpqq(m 

1
3!

rsturcstu) = 0.

(8)

(9)

these equations, are just the result of aplying the dierential operator mnpqq
to the equations of im 1 (4) and (5). from here the local equivalence can be
stated: equations (8) and (9) can be written locally as

mcmnp  mnprr = mnp + npm + pmn,

and

m 

1
3!

mnpqmcnpq = constant.

(10)

(11)

now the right members of (10) and (11) correspond, respectively, to gauge
changes in cmnp and . so those sides are gauge equivalent to zero, leaving
us with equations (4) and (5). in other words the physical relevant solutions
of both models are the same, at the local level.

in other direction, closed 0 and 3-forms (m = 0 = [mcnpq]) are always
solutions of the equations (8) and (9), while they become trivial in the model
described by the action im 1. locally, this closed forms are always exact and
then the gauge invariance allow us to gauge them away. globally, this will
depend on the cohomological structure of the base manifolds and both models
may dier in their space of solutions.

another way to see this local equivalence is the following procedure: im 2
can be rewritten introducing f mnp  mnpqfq as the dual tensor of fm.
we can eliminate f mnp through its equation of motion: f mnp = mc mnp

3

and substituting back, the action for the massive antisymmetric eld c mnp
appears. going on an additional step, the dual of the antisymmetric eld
c mnp = 1
m mnpqvq is introduced, and the action for the vector eld vm, eq.
(2), is obtained. on the other hand, if we introduce    1
4 mnpqgmnpq as
the dual of the strenght eld gmnpq into the action im 2, we observe that 
plays the role of an auxiliary eld, whose elimination through its equation of
motion ( = m) lead to the action of a massive (pseudo)scalar eld.

it is worth recalling that since the action is expressed only in derivatives
of the scalar eld, then the dual theory can be achieved, reemplacing m by
2 lm and adding a bf term: 1
1

4 lmmnpqnbpq[8]. the dual action is [4]

id =< 

1

2.4!

gmnpqgmnpq 

1

2.3!

(mcmnp  hmnp)(mc mnp  h mnp) >, (12)

where hmnp = mbnp + nbpm + pbmn is the eld strength of the antisym-
metric eld bmn, which was introduced in the bf term. this action just
describes the interaction of open menbranes whose boundaries are closed
strings [9] and is invariant under the following gauge transformations

cmnp = mnp + npm + pmn,

bmn = mn  nm  mmn.

(13)

the  gauge transformation allows us gauged away the antisymmetric eld
bmn, leading to the massive antisymmetric eld cmnp action.

let us now show the canonical equivalence for these two theories on co-
homological trivial region of space-time. for the non-gauge invariant action
im 1, the canonical hamiltonian is found to be

h1 =

1

2.3!

subject to the set of, second class, constraints

3!

mijk,

(14)

(15)

where  and ijk are the canonical conjugated momenta associated to  and
cijk, respectively.

on the other hand, for the gauge invariant action im 2, we have

h2 = 3ijkijk +

ijkcijk]2,

(16)

subject to the rst class constraints

jk = iijk

mijki.

(17)

these constraints are doubly reducible, i.e., there are functions z ij
zk(x, y) such that r dyz ij

k (x, y)ij(y) = 0 and r dyz k(x, y)z ij

fact must be taken into account when the gauge freedom is xed.

k (x, y) and
k (x, z) = 0. this

it is straightforward to show that these two hamiltonians are related by
linear combinations of the set of second class constraints for h1, reecting
the canonical equivalence:

h2 = h1 + 3ijk[ijk +

1

mijk] +

[

mijkcijk].

(18)

this situation is similar to those theories which involve a mass mechanism
through topological coupling [6][10]. moreover, we can see that im 1 is a
gauge xed version of the gauge invariant action im 2. in fact, we note that
ij = kijk can be considered as rst class constraints and  = 0 as the
gauge xing condition1.

now, we are going on to show the equivalence through the following

master action

independent variations in amnp, , cmnp and  lead to the following equations

and

mnpqgmnpq,

mnpqm(  ) = 0,

mnpqq(amnp  cmnp) = 0.

1ijk and iijk have the same information in three space dimensions

5

replacing the expressions for amnp and  given by eqs. (20) and (21) into im ,
the gauge invariant action im 2 is obtained. on the other hand, the solutions
of the equations of motion (22) and (23) are

   = , cmnp  amnp = mnp,

(24)

where  and mnp are 0 and 3-closed forms, respectively. locally, we can set

 = constant, mnp  lmnp = mlnp + nlpm + plmn,

(25)

and substituting into im , we obtain the following stueckelberg action

1

is = <

(26)

this action is invariant under

cmnp = mnp + npm + pmn,

lmn = mn,

(27)

which allow us to gauge away the lmn eld and recover im 1 (we have redened
   as  since  is a constant).
in this way, the local equivalence is
also stated. on the other hand, we can consider  =    and amnp =
cmnp  mnp as general solutions in order to obtain the following gauge
invariant action

im = <

m2(  )2

this action is global and locally equivalent to im 2, and the topological sec-
tors, not present in im 1, are now considered. indeed, the equations of motion
which are obtained after performing independent variations on cmnp, mnp, 
and  in im are

m(c mnp  mnp)  mnpqq(  ) = 0
m(c mnp  mnp)  mnpqq = 0

(29)

and

m(  ) 

m(  ) 

mnpqmcnpq +

1
3!
mnpqmcnpq = 0,

1
3!
1
3!

mnpqmnpq = 0

(30)

from which is easily deduced that  and mnp are closed 0 and 3-forms,
respectively, i.e. mnpqq = 0 = mnpqmnpq. taking into account this last
result and applying the dierential operator mnpqq on the set rst order
dierential equationss given by (30), the equations of motion for the gauge
invariant action im 2 are obtained (equations (8) and (9).

moreover, we can eliminate  and cmnp to achieve

where

im 1 = im 1[a,]  itop[,],

itop[,] =<

mmnpqmnpq >

(31)

(32)

is the bf term for the topological coupling between 0 and 3-forms in four
dimensions. from this result, we have that the partition funtions of im 1 and
im 2 dier by a topological factor.

zm 2 = ztopzm 1

(33)

in general, on manifolds with non trivial topological structure ztop 6= 1. only
when the manifold has a trivial structure, we will have ztop  1, reecting
the local equivalence.

finally, we will construct the supersymmetric formulation of the gauge
invariant action for the massive axion. for this proposal, we need (anti)chiral
superelds ( and +) and a supereld v whose supersymmetric eld strength
2 (dd + d d)v , where (ddv ) d d is (anti) chiral supereld. this
is g =  1
later supereld describes the cmnp in a supersymmetric way[11]. the super-
symmetric action is

i =

(34)

where the last two terms are the supersymmetric extension of the topological
coupling.
in components (using majorana spinors), this action is written
down as

where (a, b, vm  1
3! mnpqcnpq, d, ) and (a, , , f, g) are the components
of v and  multiplets, respectively. this action describes 8 bosonic and 8
fermionic degrees of freedom and is invariant under the o-shell supersym-
metric transformations

b = i5,

a = i,
v = im,
 = (.v) + 5d + mma  5mma

d = i5mm,

and

 = i5,

a = i,
 = [ma  5m]m + [f + 5g],
f = imm,

g = i5mm.

(36)

(37)

note that the a, a and b bosonic elds also have the same mass as the axion
eld, as can be seen after eliminating the g, d and f auxiliary elds, just
as the dilaton acquire mass in the linear multiplet, in the supersymmetric
formulation for the cremmer-sherk action[12]

sumarizing, we have seen that a gauge invariant description for massive
axions is possible. this gauge invariant description is (locally)equivalent
to the non-gauge invariant proposal. the supersymmetric formulation was
given. a complete brst analysis of the gauge invariant model considered
in this paper is under consideration.
