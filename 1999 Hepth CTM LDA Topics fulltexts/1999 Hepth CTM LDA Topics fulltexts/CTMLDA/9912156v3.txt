abstract

the hypothesis is discussed that our universe is really 5dimensional with a nonzero

cosmological constant that produces a large negative curvature. in this scenario, the

observable at 4dimensional world is identied with the holographic projection of the

5dimensional world onto its own boundary.

very often a source of strong poetry and strong science is a good metaphor. my favorite one is

platos cave: the parable of men sitting in a dark cave, watching the moving shadows on its wall.

they think that the shadows are real and not just projections of the outside world. it seems to

me that the latest stages of the ongoing struggle to understand interactions of elementary particles

create a picture stunningly close to this parable.

a. m. polyakov in [1]

1. motivation

it has recently been conjectured that various conformally invariant 4dimensional gauge
theories including n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yang mills theory with t hooft coupling
 = g2
y m n have a strong coupling description in terms of type iib superstring theory
compactied on a 5-dimensional einstein manifold e5 [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. the dilaton is

constant,  = 0, and the string coupling constant is related to the gauge coupling constant

by  = e0 = g2

y m . the einstein manifold has constant curvature radius

1

4

l  

and n units of electric and magnetic ramond-ramond ux ow through it. the geometry

of the remaining 5-dimensional spacetime is that of anti-de sitter space ads5 with the same

curvature radius l:

ds2 = d2 + e 2

l

dx2
||

.

x|| parametrizes the 4-dimensional space in which the gauge theory lives, and  can be
regarded as renormalization group time in the sense that 4d scale transformations

can be absorbed by the shift

x||  x||e

   + l .

the ads boundary at  =  represents the uv limit of the gauge theory [9].  is a
new physical coordinate, e.g. in the sense that various objects in the gauge theory, such as

1

instantons or pfaan particles in the case of gauge group so(n) are localized both in

the x|| and the  directions [10, 11].

string loop corrections are proportional to 1
n 2 , while -corrections are proportional to
1
in particular, the strong-coupling limit    can, for large n, be investigated in
the classical supergravity approximation. it is hoped that non-supersymmetric yang-mills

.

theory and perhaps qcd have a similar description in terms of a 5-dimensional string theory

on some dierent background [12, 13].

one immediate question might be: why dont we see the fth dimension? if it is true

that nonabelian gauge theory at large scales (large enough for the coupling to be strong) is

best described by a dual string theory in a 5-dimensional curved background, why then does

the real world  which contains su(3) gauge theory  look 4-dimensional and at, rather
than 5-dimensional and curved? in the case of n = 4 sym, the answer is: even though
ads5 is strongly curved, it has a at 4dimensional minkowskian boundary, and at scales

much larger than the curvature radius l the 5dimensional world essentially reduces to its

own projection onto this boundary.1

given this answer, it is very tempting to use it for a seemingly unrelated question that

can already be asked purely in the context of einstein gravity and a priori has nothing to do

with the ads/cft correspondence: why does our 4dimensional world look at and large,

given that there should naturally be a huge cosmological constant which should strongly

curve space-time, with a tiny curvature radius?

that is, it seems tempting to assume that our world is really 5-dimensional rather than

4-dimensional. let us further assume that the 5d cosmological constant 5 is huge as it

should be. but let us assume it comes out such that the sign of the 5d curvature is negative.

so the 5d space becomes anti-de sitter, with curvature radius

l2 

1
2
55

,

and so it acquires a boundary (2

5 is the 5d newton constant). although the curvature radius
1this is similar to kaluza-klein reduction on a circle of radius l, where at scales much larger than l the

kaluza-klein modes drop out and an eective 4d theory is seen [17]. in our case the circle is replaced by the

noncompact coordinate , so things are more subtle, but the conclusion comes out essentially the same.

2

of ads5 is small, its 4d boundary is innitely extended. in this sense we can consider eld

theory on this ads5 at scales much larger than l. for exactly the same reason as in the case

of sym theory, all we would see at low energies should be the projection of the 5d world onto

its own at boundary. can we identify this projection with the observable at 4d world?

2. hidden cosmological constant

before discussing some obvious objections against this scenario, let us demonstrate in more

detail why in this setup the cosmological constant 4 of the 4dimensional world can be zero:

the 5dimensional cosmological constant 5 does not induce a 4dimensional cosmological

constant but gets absorbed in the ads5 curvature radius. this is essentially a new version of a

mechanism discussed long ago by rubakov and shaposhnikov [19].2 very similar suggestions

by e. and h. verlinde have also just appeared in [20].

let us rst consider einstein gravity. also, we start with the case where the 4d metric

g = e2()g has only an overall dependence:

ds2 = d2 + e2()g(x)dxdx .

g is some background metric which for now we allow to be nonat.3

the einstein equations imply (we redene 5 by a factor)

r(5)

 = g 5

(2.1)

with 5 assumed negative. the lhs of (2.1) can be written in terms of the 4d curvature
tensor r(4) of the metric g and the shifted dilaton (a slight misnomer here)

   log(g) =  4() + const.

in the form

r(5)

 = r(4)

 +

1
4

e 

2 g(   2) ,

(2.2)

2as the author found out after this paper was written.
3in general, g(x, ) will not factorize into a dependent piece and an xdependent piece. in this case

one should dene  via the logarithm of the 4d volume: e4()  {r d4x pg(4)(x, )}/{r d4x} .

3

where dot means d/d. from this and (2.1) we read o that g is an einstein metric

with eective 4d cosmological constant 4 (also redened by a factor):

r(4)

 = g(4)

 4 ,

where

is independent.

4 = e 

2 [5

 can be eliminated using the gequation of motion

the result is

2 = 5 .

4 =

2 (5 +

4

2) .

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

we see that there is a solution in which the 5d cosmological constant is completely cancelled

by 2, and the 4d space is at:

2 =  45 =  4 = 0 .

this is ads5 (recall that 5 is negative). of course there are also classical solutions ()
with 4 6= 0. those just correspond to dierent foliations of ads5 by 4d hypersurfaces, so in
the present case the value of 4 is in fact ambiguous. but in the next section, a particular

foliation will be singled out such that 4 is welldened.

3. breaking conformal invariance

let us now come to two immediate objections against the proposal that our world is the

projection of a 5dimensional anti-de-sitter world onto its at boundary: the 4dimensional

world that this scenario predicts diers from the one we observe in at least two major aspects:

1. it is conformally invariant.

4

2. it has zero 4dimensional newton constant.

the rst point reects the fact that the so(2,4) symmetry group of ads5 becomes the

conformal group on the 4d boundary. to break conformal invariance, we can let the 5d

geometry deviate from ads5 near its boundary. such a deviation would seem to be natural

for a physical system with a surface, such as the 5d universe with 4d boundary.4

more precisely, we will assume that the 5d cosmological constant becomes dependent

near the adsboundary:

5().

note that this implicitly singles out a particular foliation of ads5 by 4dimensional hyper-

surfaces: those of constant 5. a dependent 5 can arise when 5d einstein gravity is
embedded in string theory, in particular on perturbations of the ads5  e5 backgrounds
mentioned in the introduction.5 at low energies this corresponds to embedding einstein

gravity in 5d gauged supergravity. there, 5 is related to the potential v [i()], where i

are the scalar elds of gauged supergravity. those elds in turn generally depend on . the

way in which they roll down the potential v () as a function of  then encodes, i.p., the

details of the breakdown of the conformal and other symmetries.

e.g., the 5d geometry might be the holographic dual of rg ows in 4d gauge theories

that approach a xed point in the ir (the interior of ads5) but not in the uv (the boundary

of ads5). explicit examples of 5d geometries with varying potential v have been discussed

e.g. in [15, 16]; although most of the examples correspond, in the dual picture, to rg ows

between uv and ir xed points, there are also ows without uv xed points.

assuming a constant dilaton 6, the equations of motion of section 2 including (2.6)

remain the same even in the case of a dependent 5, and the conclusion is also the same:

4this scenario of a 4d universe whose conformal invariance is slightly broken might be related to the

proposal [14] of conformal invariance at the tev scale.

5in this way one can also add all kinds of 4d matter and gauge elds to the scenario, in terms of kaluza

klein modes on e5 or branes wrapped around cycles in e5.

6which is the case in the solutions in [15, 16]; the general case would require redening  = 2  log g

and also involves the dilaton equation of motion.

5

there exists a solution for () with

2 = 45()  4 = 0

everywhere, despite of the fact that conformal symmetry is broken. the general solution
for () has a constant but nonzero 4 in (2.6). 4 is independent since g and r are

independent in (2.3). but if 4 is zero at one , it is zero for all .

so we only need to argue that 4 is zero in the interior of ads5. at this point it might

seem that we have merely replaced one netuning problem by another one: now we have

to netune 2 to exactly cancel the vedimensional cosmological constant.

however, the situation does seem to have improved. before, we had to ne-tune the 4d

cosmological constant at high energies to a precise nonzero value, such that the lowenergy

cosmological constant ends up being exactly zero, which seemed absurd. now, by contrast,

we only have to nd an argument why the hypersurfaces of constant 5 dened by the 5d

gauged supergravity solution should be at. this seems much more natural. we will return

to this issue in the future.

so here we have a holographic mechanism that keeps the visible 4dimensional cosmo-

logical constant zero with the help of one extra dimension: the 5dimensional cosmological

constant 5 may be huge and moreover may change as a function of , as matter elds roll

down some potential v (as in the above example of 5d gauged supergravity). but 4 remains

zero: 5() is completely absorbed by the dependence of  (i.e. of the warp factor).

4. adding 4d gravity

the second immediate objection mentioned above was that the 4d world that lives on the

adsboundary has zero newton constant. a related point is that the modes of the 5d gravi-

ton that would represent massless 4d gravitons are not normalizable: there is no dynamical

4d gravity.7 to recall why the 4d newton constant is zero we use the form

ds2 =

l2
z2 (dz2 + dx2
||

)

of the adsmetric. as in ordinary kaluzaklein compactication on a circle (instead of the

noncompact coordinate z), integrating the 5d hilbert-einstein action over the coordinate z

yields a 4d hilbert-einstein action:

1

5

z dz d4x|| qg(5)r(5)

z d4x|| qg(4) r(4)

with

z

l3
z3 dz .

the problem is that this integral diverges and therefore 4 is zero.

this point may also be overcome by letting the geometry deviate from ads5 near its

boundary at z = 0. a radical deviation would be to simply cut o the 5d universe near its

boundary following randall and sundrum [17]: we restrict z to the range

z   .

this corresponds to an explicit sharp uv cuto in the dual gauge theory. now there are

propagating 4d gravitons and the 4d newton constant is nonzero:

2
4 =

1
3

2
5

2
l3 .

of course, in general the value of the 4d newton constant is not universal: it will depend

on how precisely ads5 is cut o near its boundary. e.g., instead of a sharp cuto one might

try to look for smooth modications of the metric near the adsboundary such that the

warp factor, instead of being proportional to 1

z2 , converges to zero at z = 0. this would
also lead to a nonvanishing newton constant and to dynamical 4d gravity. one might

ask at rst what kind of gauge theory ow such a geometry would be dual to. but the

presence of 4d gravity seems to suggest that such geometries have no pure gauge theory

interpretation; rather, the gauge theory should be embedded in a string theory. in fact, if

the warp factor goes to zero at the boundary, the metric g goes to zero. this suggests that

one should perhaps think of the radial direction of ads5 as being compactied. in building a

consistent compactication, presumably one then inevitably ends up with the type of string

compactication studied in [18].

7

at this point the simple picture we started with becomes complicated. in particular, it

seems to be no longer clear how to argue that the vanishing of 4 inside ads5 implies the

vanishing of 4 near the boundary. certainly the equations used in section 2 are no longer

appropriate  there are corrections and string loop corrections.8

in conclusion, the conjecture that our at 4dimensional world is only the at projection

of a strongly curved 5dimensional world seems intriguing, but solving the cosmological

constant problem requires, at the least, further thought.
