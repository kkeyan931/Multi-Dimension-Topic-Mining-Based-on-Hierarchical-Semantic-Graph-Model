abstract

the purpose of this paper is to investigate the gauge symmetry of classical eld
theories in integral formalism. a gauge invariant theory is dened in terms
of the invariance of the physical observables under the coordinate transforma-
tions in principal bundle space. through the detailed study on the properties
of non-abelian parallel transporter under gauge transformations, we show that
it is not generally a two-point spinor, i.e. an operator to be aected only by
the gauge group elements at the two end points of the parallel transport path,
except for the pure gauge situation, and therefore the local gauge symmetry
for non-abelian models is found to be broken in non-perturbative domain.
however, an abelian gauge theory is proved to be strictly invariant under
local gauge transformation, as it is illustrated by the invariance of the interfer-
ence pattern of electrons in aharonov-bohm eect. the related issues of the
phenomenon are discussed.

1 introduction

it has been accepted without doubt that the present-day physical theories of the fundamental

interactions in nature largely follow from the principle of gauge symmetry, which postulates

that any physically acceptable eld model should be invariant under gauge transformations.

for a concrete gauge eld model it is constructed from the principle as follows: 1) the re-

quirement for the invariance of the eld action s under the action of a nitely dimensional

lie group leads to the existence of conserved currents (noether theorem); 2) the general-

ization of the invariance of the action under the global gauge transformations to the local

ones introduces in the coupling of the currents through a gauge eld. in fact it is just the

second step, i.e. the replacement of  in action by d, that enables us to have complete

theories to describe the matter elds and the interactions coupling matters. the quantized

gauge eld model (standard model) has been successful to a large extent in explaining and

predicting the experimental results in elementary particle physicsfor an overview, see e.g.

ref.[1].

the invariance of eld action, or more exactly the invariance of lagrangian density under

gauge transformations, constitutes the basis for the dierential formalism of a gauge eld

theory. according to it, two eld models hl, a, i and hl, a

, i are equivalent if they are

related to each other by the form invariance of lagrangian density l, and therefore by the

invariance of local eld equations, under gauge transformations including the global (gt1)

and local (gt2a for matter eld and gt2b for gauge eld) ones. here we have used the

notations in ref.[2].

it is assumed as a matter of course that other formalisms of gauge

eld theory, e.g. the integral formalism [3-4], should be the same as the dierential one with

respect to the inherent gauge symmetry. to meet the requirement, the gauge transformation

of a parallel transporter, the counterpart of gauge eld a(x) in the integral formalism,

should be a two-point spinor1, i.e. that to be aected only by the gauge transformation

gt2a at the two end points which the parallel transporter connects. contrary to this

assumption, however, we prove that the two-point spinor property for a parallel transporter

for a non-abelian gauge eld is conditional if the eld is non-trivial and, therefore, the gauge

freedom for a non-abelian theory is much more restricted than what we see from dierential

1it is termed in analogy to two-point tensor in [5-6] for the parallel transporter of a tensor eld in

spacetime manifold.

point of view on gauge theories.

in this paper, we rst clarify in the framework of bre bundle some commonly used

terminologies such as gauge transformation and gauge invariance, then give a denition of

gauge invariant eld theory in terms of the invariance of physical observables. after proving

the equivalence of gauge transformation gt2b and two-point spinor property of innitesimal

parallel transporter in the form of one-order expansion, we will study in detail the property of

nite parallel transporter in non-abelian and abelian gauge theories. finally, some related

issues will be discussed.

2 gauge transformation and gauge invariance

in this section we begin with the clarication of some terminologies regarding a gauge eld

theory, which are by no means uniform throughout the literature. we here adopt the de-

nition of gauge theory in ref.[2]:

a gauge eld theory is the one that is derived from the gauge principle2

and represents the geometry of a principal bre bundle. the gauge group is given

by the structure group of the bundle.

since the geometrical framework of bre bundle provides a natural mathematical setting

for the representation of physical gauge theories, we will largely use the language for the

clarication of the terminologies we will use in our study.

a principal bre bundle is dened as a tuple he, m, , gi with bundle space e, base

space m, projection map : e  m, and structure group g which is homeomorphic to bre

space f . the base space m we study in this paper is minkowskian or euclidean spacetime

for simplicity.

in bre bundle language a matter eld is given as a cross section in the

associated vector bundle of principal bundle. it is a smooth map : m  e, which satises

  (x) = x for x  m. of course there is no continuous cross section unless the principle

bundle is with a trivial topology, i.e. the product of base and bre space. to describe gauge

eld a(x) (throughout the paper a is the short handed symbol for

aa

t a, where t as

are the generators of the lie algebra of gauge group), we need to identify ia(x), where 

2the above-mentioned gauge symmetry principle is close to the denition of gauge postulate in ref.[2],

and should be distinguished from the term gauge principle there.

is the coupling constant, with the local representation b(x) [7, p. 160] of connection form

, which is given as [8, p. 255]

 = g1(x)dg(x) + g1(x)b(x)g(x)dx

(1)

in the local coordinate : (g(x), x) ( g  g, x  m), and which determines a unique

decomposition t e = p e  he of the tangent space t e of the principal bundle e into a

perpendicular and a horizontal part.

cross section at each point x  u, an arbitrary neighborhood in base space, can be

regarded locally as an element of gauge group. a choice of a cross section is equivalent to

the choice of a local coordinate, and the cross section in a local moving frame {ei} is given as

(x) = {i(x)}. therefore the local gauge transformations gt2a and gt2b can be derived

from the transformation of local coordinates

t = 1

   : g  u  g  u

under this transformation the cross section (x) in bundle space e transforms as

(x) = g(x)(x)

(2)

(3)

with the local moving frame transformation in the tangent space of the associate vector

bundle of principal bundle: {ei}  {e

i}. thus we have got the gauge transformation gt2a.

to obtain gauge transformation gt2b, we will make use of connection form eq.(1). in two

dierent coordinates (g1(x), x) and (g2(x), x), if a connection form is expressed as [8, p. 256]

e = g1

1 (x)dg1(x) + g1

1 (x)b(1)

 (x)g1(x)dx

= g1

2 (x)dg2(x) + g1

2 (x)b(2)

 (x)g2(x)dx,

then the relation of the local representations of connection form is therefore found to be

b(2)

 (x) = g(x)

g1
x (x) + g(x)b(1)

 (x)g1(x),

(4)

(5)

where g = g1g1

2 . gauge transformation gt2b has been derived in this way if the local

representation b(x) is identied with the gauge eld ia. from eq. (3) and eq. (5)

we obviously see that the local coordinate transformation eq. (2) can be realized by any

4

c 1 gauge group element g(x) (with continuous rst derivatives with respect to spacetime

coordinates x), which also preserves the invariance of the eld action constructed by (x)

and a(x). in this sense we call a c 1 coordinate transformation t(x) a general local

gauge transformation.

in eq. (3) the action of gauge group is performed in the same bre over each point in

the base space, so we call it perpendicular action of gauge group. with connection form

 we can also dene another type of action of gauge group, that is, parallel transport of

bres from one point in base space to another. it involves dierent points in base space,

so it is termed horizontal action of gauge group.

in this paper we denote a parallel

transporter, the gauge group element which implements such action, as (b; x, x0), where

the transport path  is an arbitrary piecewise smooth curve which connects two end points,

say x0 and x, and is parametrized by the path variable t. as a point in bre space, cross

section (x) is transported accordingly:

(x) = (b; x, x0)(x0)

(6)

parallel transport is determined by the horizontal direction of the bundle space [8, p. 253]:

 = 1d + 1bdx = 0.

(7)

over a smooth segment of the path on which there is a denite tangent vector eld, dx(t)/dt,

it is equivalent to the following matrix dierential equation:

d
dt

(t) = b(t)(t),

(t0) = i,

(8)

(9)

where (t) = (b(t); t, t0), and b(t) = b(x(t))dx(t)/dt. there are two types of the

solution to the equation:

(t) = p exp(cid:18)z t

t0

dsb(s)(cid:19) = i +z t

t0

dsb(s)

+z t

t0

dsb(s)z s

t0

ds1b(s1) +    +z t

t0

dsb(s)   z sn1

t0

dsnb(sn) +    ,

(10)

5

for the case of non-abelian gauge group, and

(t) = exp(cid:18)z t

t0

dsb(s)(cid:19)

(11)

for the case of abelian gauge group, since the dierential equation in the latter case reduces

to an ordinary linear dierential equation. a parallel transporter along a piecewise smooth

curve or a gauge group element of horizontal action is therefore given as the product of these

operators dened on the monotonic smooth segments. naturally there is the accompanying

dierential equation for parallel transport of matter eld:

d
dt

(t)  ia(x(t))

dx
dt

(t)(t) = d(x(t))

dx
dt

(t) = 0,

(t0) = 0.

(12)

(13)

from these results it is concluded that, under a parallel transport, the total wave function for

a matter eld not only changes its amplitude but also undergoes a rotation in the internal

space such as isospin space in su(2) gauge theory.

parallel transporter plays an important role in the integral formalism of gauge theory. it

adequately describes all physics contained in the gauge theory and, moreover, the summation

of it is a physically measurable quantity because it denes the transition amplitude of a

particle moving along a classical trajectory in the presence of gauge eld a. for overviews

of gauge eld theories with  = p exphc a(x)dx as the dynamical variable (loop space

formalism), see e.g. ref.[9, chap. 7], ref.[10, chap. 4]

we are now in a position to dene gauge invariance, the central concept in gauge eld

theory. following the denition of gauge eld theory in ref.[2] cited at the beginning of the

section, we give the denition as follows:

a gauge invariant eld theory is a gauge eld theory which is invari-

ant under the bundle coordinate transformation t, that is, all the observables

including the local and non-local ones should be invariant under its induced

transformations gt1 and gt2. the classication of global and local invariant

theories is according to whether t is spacetime dependent or not.

obviously from this denition we see that the gauge freedom of a gauge eld theory is

comprised of the actions of gauge group that preserve the invariance of the theory. the

6

distinction of the denition from those elsewhere lies in the invariance of the non-local oper-
ators, such as (x2)(a; x2, x1)(x1), the operator for the bound state wave function [10].

should the operator be invariant under local gauge transformations, the parallel transporter

must be a two-point spinor, i.e. it transforms as follows:

(a

; x2, x1) = g(x2)(a; x2, x1)g1(x1),

(14)

under the local gauge transformations. this two-point spinor property of  is regarded as

the natural consequence of the general covariance in bundle space (see e.g.[12]), since the

physics should be independent of the choice of coordinate. in bre bundle language we can

say that the commutation of perpendicular action and horizontal action of gauge group

guarantees a coordinate-free description of physics contained in a gauge theory. in addition

to the gauge xing terms which are introduced in the lagrangian density for the appropriate

physical situations, however, we nd that this requirement actually imposes more restriction

on the gauge freedom of a gauge theory, because we will prove later that it is conditional in

non-abelian gauge theories.

3 joint of dierential and integral formalism

in practice a parallel transporter (x, x0) can be expressed as innite product of local

operator too. it is obtained through discretization of eq. (8):

(t + )  (t)



= b(t)(t)

the solution of the dierence equation is

(t + n) = lim
n

0

yi=n1

(i + b (i )) (t0).

(15)

(16)

if there is a denite tangent vector at each point of a segment of the parallel transport path,

we get the alternative form for a parallel transporter over the segment:

p expz t

t0

dsa(s) = lim
t0

(i + a(tn1)t)    (i + a(t0)t),

(17)

where a(ti) = ia(x(ti))dx(ti)/dt, i = 1, 2,    , n  1.

innitesimal parallel transporter i + iadx bridges over the connection between dif-

ferential and integral formalism of gauge theory. when x  0, one-order approximation

g(x + x)  g(x) +

g(x)
x x

7

(18)

can be regarded to be an exact equality, and therefore we nd that innitesimal parallel

transporter, i + iadx, transforms as a two-point spinor under gauge transformation

gt2b:

i + ia

dx =  g(x) +

g(x)

x dx! (i + iadx) g1(x)

= g(x + dx)(i + iadx)g1(x).

(19)

obviously there is the equivalence of gauge transformation gt2b (eq. (5)) and two-point

spinor property of innitesimal parallel transporter.

two-point spinor property for an innitesimal parallel transporter is crucial for the in-

variance of parallel transport equation of  (eq. (12)). in terms of innitesimal parallel

transporter the covariant change of (x), which means the dierence of the eld at x and

that parallelly transported from x + dx, can be expressed as

cov(x) = (i  ia(x)dx)(x + dx)  (x) = d(x)dx

(20)

under local gauge transformation it is transformed according to eq. (3) and eq. (19) to

cov(x) = g(x)  

x  ia(x)! (x)dx.

(21)

thus the dierential equation for the parallel transport of (x), which can also be express

as

cov/t = 0,

lim
t0

(22)

is transformed covariantly under gauge transformation, as long as innitesimal parallel trans-

porter is a two-point spinor. this is consistent with the invariance of the horizontal direction

in bundle space under the action of structure group.

4 properties of parallel transporter in non-abelian gauge

theory

from eq. (17) there are obviously the following three properties of parallel transporter

21(a) = 2(a)1(a);

8

(a) = ((a))1;

(cac 1) = c(a)c 1.

here  denotes the inverse path of  and c is a global gauge transformation.

in this section we will primarily study the property of non-abelian parallel transporter

under local gauge transformation. it was always taken for granted that nite parallel trans-

porter should be a two-point spinor too, since it can be pieced together with innite number

of innitesimal parallel transporter, which have been proved to be two-point spinors. along

with the analysis on the causes for the false statement, we will give a detailed study on

parallel transport equation, nite and innitesimal parallel transporter and their connection

under gauge transformations.

4.1

investigation into dierential equation eq. (8) and eq. (12)

the dierential equation that determines the parallel transport of matter eld (x) (eqs.

(8) and (12)) is of the type

dx
dt

(t) = w (t)x(t).

let us study the behavior of the equation under the transformation

substituting eq. (24) into eq. (23), we have

x(t) = l(t)y(t).

(23)

(24)

d
dt

(l(t)y(t)) =

dl
dt

(t)y(t) + l(t)

dy
dt

(t) = w (t)l(t)y(t).

(25)

then eq. (23) is transformed to

dy
dt

(t) = w (t)y(t),

with

w (t) = l1(t)

d
dt

l(t) + l1(t)w (t)l(t).

(26)

(27)

the relation between w and w  is just that of gauge transformation gt2b if l1 is identied

with gauge group element g and, therefore, it is concluded that

(t) = p exp(cid:18)z t

t0

dsa(s)(cid:19) (t0) = g(t)p exp(cid:18)z t

t0

dsa(s)(cid:19) g1(t0)(t0).

(28)

9

seemingly the procedure will lead to the conclusion eq. (14), but denitely it has only

proved the two-point spinor property of the parallel transporter when the eld (t) is par-

allelly transported over a one-dimensional range [t0, t], a trivial eld theory, because all the

operations in the procedure are stuck to the one-dimensional range [t0, t] and the integral in

eq. (28) should be interpreted as a one-variable integral. in any one-dimensional situation

we can always nd a local gauge transformation gt2b that makes gauge eld a(t) vanish

identically because the dierential equation

dg
dt

(t)g1(t) + g(t)a(t)g1(t) = 0

(29)

has denite solutions, then the two-point spinor property holds absolutely (see appendix a).

in fact, a parallel transport path should be regarded as the map [t0, t]  m rather than [t0, t]

itself. the point will be clearly seen through the discussion in the following subsections.

a special case involving the solution of eq. (8) that needs to be claried is a periodic

a(s). without the loss of generality we suppose a(s + 2) = a(s). then for a parallel

transport path, [0, 4]  m, we have

(4, 2)(2, 0) = p exp(cid:18)z 4

2

dsa(s)(cid:19) p exp(cid:18)z 2

0

dsa(s)(cid:19) .

its term of the order (i)2 is

z 2

dsa(s)z s

dsa(s) + (z 2

dsa(s))2,

(30)

0 dsa(s)

with the presence of the periodic function a(s). if the (i)2 term of (4, 0) = p expr 4
should also be formally given as r 4
factor r s

0 dsa(s) according to eq. (10), the integral
0 dsa(s) in it is indenite due to the period 2 of a(s). to guarantee a denite

0 dsa(s)r s

group composition law:

(4, 2)(2, 0) = (4, 0),

we must specify that the parallel transporter constructed by a periodic a(s) should be

expressed as the product of those along the monotonic one, i.e. (2n, 0) = n(2, 0) in the

example.

10

4.2

investigation into innite product eq. (17)

to see if the two-point spinor property of nite parallel transporter, a non-local operator, can

be obtained through piecing together two-point spinor property of local innitesimal parallel

transporter, we need to study the innite product form of nite parallel transporter eq. (17),

since we have proved that an innitesimal parallel transporter will be a two-point spinor only

when it is in the form of one-order expansion. the transport path, [t0, t]  m, is divided into

countably innite small range [ti, ti+1], for i = 0, 1,    , n, then a nite parallel transporter

after gauge transformation gt2 becomes the following path-ordered innite product:

(a

(x); t, t0) = (i + a(tn1)t)    (i + a(t1)t)(i + a(t0)t),

(31)

where a(ti) = ia

 (x(ti)) dx/dt(ti), and t  0. with the two-point spinor property

of an innitesimal parallel transporter in the form of the one-order expansion along the

transport path, it is equal to

(u(tn1) + u(tn1)) (i + a(tn1)t)u 1(tn1) (u(tn2) + u(tn2)) (i + a(tn2)t)   

   (u(t0) + u(t0)) (i + a(t0)t)u 1(t0),

where u(t) = g(x(t)). if we take

u(ti+1) = u(ti) + u(ti) = u(ti) +

du
dt

(ti)t

(32)

for i = 1, 2,    , n  1, then all the group elements in the middle will be canceled in couples

and a two-point spinor (a(x); t, t0) will be obtained.

to check the validity of the argument, we can study the relation of the gauge group

elements at the two end points of the transport path. the simplest case is a smooth group

element function u(t) on the transport path, i.e. there are innite-th partial derivatives with

respect to spacetime variables at each point of the path, [t0, t]  m. according to eq. (32),

the gauge group elements are related by iterative one-order expansion along the transport

path, so we obtain the following relation (see appendix b) of the gauge group elements at

the end points of a smooth transport path:

u(t) = u(tn1) +

du
dt

(tn1)t

= u(tn2) + 2

xk=0  n

k ! (

)ku(t0)(t)k,

where t = (t  t0)/n. when n  , it reduces to the taylor expansion in variable t:

u(t) = u(t0) + (t  t0)u (t0) +

1
2!

(t  t0)2u (2)(t0) +    .

changing the variable of dierentials t to spacetime variables x, we have

g(x) = g(x0) +



xk=1

1

k!  (x  x

0 )



x!k

g(x0).

(33)

(34)

(35)

this is not denitely consistent with the taylor expansion of g(x) directly with respect to

spacetime variables x, if g(x) is only a c k(k < ) function, a general local gauge trans-

formation, on the subset of m, into which the parallel transport path is embedded. the

relation of the taylor expansion in path parameter t and spacetime variables x is given in

appendix c. from the above discussion it can be seen that it is improper to treat the parallel

transport of matter eld on m as a one-dimensional problem in the parameter space [t0, t].

4.3 condition for the preservation of parallel transport under

gauge transformation

first we start with the following equation in the parameter space [t0, t]:

t0

(t)  (t0) = p exp(cid:18)z t
= z t
dsa(s)(cid:18)i +z s
dsa(s)p exp(cid:18)z s

t0

t0

dsa(s)(cid:19) (t0)  (t0)
dsa(s) +   (cid:19) (t0)

= z t

t0

dsa(s)(cid:19) (t0) = z t

t0

t0

dsa(s)(s),

(36)

where a(s) = ia(x(s))dx(s)/ds.

it is the integral equation of the parallel transport

of fermions and is equivalent to eq. (12). if the concerned parallel transporter is a two-

point spinor, this equation should transform covariantly under gauge transformation. on

the spacetime manifold m, the transformed eq. (36) after a coordinate transformation in

principal bundle space (eq. (2)) is

(x) = (x0) + iz x

x0

dza

(z)(z)

12

figure 1: a spinor 0 at x1 is parallelly transported to x2 along a family of curves connecting
the two points.

= g(x0)(x0) +z x

x0

dz(ig(z)a(z) + g(z))(z),

(37)

if (z) produced by parallel transport, a c  extension of (s) to m (the transport curves

under consideration are embedding ones), transforms covariantly. to treat the integral in

the equation as a one-parameter integral in [t0, t], we have

(t) = u(t0)(t0) +z t

t0

ds u(s)a(s)(s) +

d
ds

(u(s)(s))! z t

t0

ds u(s)

d
ds

(s)

= u(t)(t) = u(t)((t0) +z t

t0

dsa(s)(s)),

(38)

where u(t) = g(x(t)) and eq. (12) has been considered. so the integral equation for the

parallel transport of fermions appears to transform covariantly under gauge transformation.

however, as we will clarify as follows, such a treatment actually leads to the contradiction

with facts. lets study a situation described by the gure 1. the corresponding integral

equations on 1 and 2 are given as follows:

p exp(cid:18)z1

dsa(s)(cid:19) (t0)  (t0) = z1

dsa(s)(s),

p exp(cid:18)z2

dsa(s)(cid:19) (t0)  (t0) = z2

dsa(s)(s).

13

(39)

(40)

we have the following relation after subtracting eq. (40) from eq. (39)

p exp(cid:18)z1

dsa(s)(cid:19) (t0)  p exp(cid:18)z2

dsa(s)(cid:19) (t0) = z1

dsa(s)(s) z2

dsa(s)(s)

= z21

dsa(s)(s)

the left hand side of it can be rewritten as

p exp(cid:18)z1

dsa(s)(cid:19) (i  p exp(cid:18)z1

dsa(s)(cid:19)  p exp(cid:18)z2

dsa(s)(cid:19))(t0)

= p exp(cid:18)z1

dsa(s)(cid:19) (z12

dsa(s)(s)),

if eq. (36) is considered. the nal equation is therefore given as

(p exp(cid:18)z1

dsa(s)(cid:19)  i)z21

dsa(s)(s) = 0.

(41)

(42)

(43)

it indicates a trivial result for the parallel transport of 0 in the parameter space [t0, t],

which goes against facts. thus we have shown again that the dierential form a(t)dt in the

integrals of all the concerned equation have to be interpreted not only as the one-form in the

parameter space [t0, t] but also as the one-form ia(x)dx on spacetime manifold m itself.

next we will reveal the actual condition for the two-point spinor property of parallel

transporter. we consider the situation in the above gure again and set up a coordinate of a

at the two end points there is 

homotopic curve family, x(t, s), on the surface surrounded by 1 = x(t, 0) and 2 = x(t, 1).
s x(1, s) = 0. due to the parallel transport of
0 along the family of curves, there is a fermion eld (t, s) on the surface. if the parallel

s x(0, s) = 

transporters  are two-point spinors, the dierence between the transported fermions along

1 and 2 respectively to x2 will transform covariantly under gauge transformation:

(x2) = g(x2)(x2) = u(1, s)(2  1)0

(44)

according to the stokes theorem in the surface parameter space {t, s},

(x2) = igz 1

(45)

in the transformed coordinate in principal bundle space (after the action in eq. (2)), (x2)

is expressed similarly as

(46)

if (t, s) is supposed to transform covariantly. only when the (x2) calculated in the

transformed bundle coordinate (eq. (46)) and that transformed from (x2) in eq.(45)

by g(x2) are equal, will the parallel transporters under consideration be truly two-point

spinors. in other words it is the necessary condition for the two-point spinor property of

parallel transporter. from explicit calculation, however, their equivalence is true only in the

following two situations:

1) g(x) = const, a global gauge transformation gt1;

2) a pure gauge situation with f(x) = 0 identically.

in the second case, the transported fermion satises the following partial dierential

equation.

(x) = iga(x)(x),

(47)

then the general covariance of the integral equation for the parallel transport of fermions can

be restored by means of integral by parts with respect to  in eq. (37). it is in contrast

to the general covariance of the dierential equation (eqs. (12) and (22)) for the parallel

transport of fermions that the general covariance of its equivalent integral formalism (eq.

(36)) under gauge transformation is conditional. as has been given by a similar result of the

parallel transport of vector eld in tangent bundle space based on a riemannian spacetime

[13, p167], the condition f(x) = 0 identically is the sucient and necessary condition for

the equivalence of the ordinary dierential equation eq. (12) and the partial dierential

15

equation eq. (47).

i.e. that for the integrability of parallel transporter , and, through

the previous discussion, it is also the sucient and necessary condition for the preservation

of parallel transport of fermions under a general (c 1) local gauge transformation.

4.4 direct verication

the restriction on preservation of parallel transport of fermions in a non-trivial gauge eld

can be shown directly, if we treat the integrals in the following supposed equation as line

integral in spacetime manifold m rather than the one-parameter integral in the parameter

space [t0, t] itself. it is done by comparing the (i)n order terms on the both sides of the

supposed equation:

p exp(cid:18)iz x

x0

dza

(z)(cid:19) = g(x)p exp(cid:18)iz x

x0

dza(z)(cid:19) g1(x0),

(48)

where

and

g(x) = exp (i

dimg

xa=1

a(x)t a) = exp (im(x)) = i + im(x) +    ,

dimg

g1(x0) = exp (i

a(x0)t a) = exp (im(x0)).

xa=1

after the gauge transformation of a(z) is substituted into the left hand side of eq. (48),

we compare the terms of the order (i)2. the terms of the order with the permutation ma3

on the left hand side of eq. (48) are given as follows:

(i)2z x

x0

dzm(z)a(z) + (i)2z x
 (i)2z x

m(z)d(cid:18)z z

x0

x0

x0

dm(z)z z

x0

(dz)a(z) = (i)2z x

x0

dzm(z)a(z)

(dz)a(z)(cid:19) + (i)2m(x)z x

x0

dza(z).

(49)

if the integrals here are interpreted as one-variable integrals in [t0, t], i.e. ir z
r s

t0 dsa(s) and a(s)ds = ia(z)dz, there is

x0(dz)a(z) =

(50)

d(cid:18)z s

t0

dsa(s)(cid:19) = a(s)ds

as an identity, and the two sides of eq. (48) will agree up to all orders, as it is always true

for the one-dimensional situation. however, as a matter of fact, eq. (50) implies

d(cid:18)iz z

x0

(dz)a(z)(cid:19) = ia(z)dz,

(51)

3m means the part containing factors such as dm (z) and m (z), and a means those with a(z) and
dz a(z).

16

x0

r z

which is true on m only when a(z)dz is an exact form, i.e. a(z)  a(z) = 0

identically (see e.g. ref.[14, p. 10]). therefore, the consistency for the validity of eq. (48)

in [t0, t] with that on m doesnt always hold, if the gauge eld under consideration is a

non-trivial one.

5 abelian gauge theory and aharonov-bhom eect

the gauge eld theory proper with gauge group u(1) is a special type in our discussion.

the quantized u(1) gauge eld (quantum electrodynamics) well describes electromagnetic

interaction in nature. the variation of its lagrangian density

l(x) = 

1
4

f(x)f (x) + (x) (id  m) (x)

with respect to eld (x) leads to dirac equation

(id  m) (x) = 0,

(52)

(53)

where d =   iea. in the region of spacetime where eld strength f(x) identically

vanishes, it can be reduced to the equation of free eld

(i  m) f (x) = 0

through a phase factor called schwinger string [15]:

(x) = exp(cid:18)iez x

x0

a(z)dz(cid:19) f (x).

(54)

(55)

in the non-relativistic limit, this mathematical transformation corresponds to a physical

phenomena. it is the famous aharonov-bohm eect that directly demonstrates the eect of

gauge potential a on electron eld [16,17]. the experiment is arranged to allow two beams

of electron from a single source to pass either side of a round coil and impinge on a screen

behind. the magnetic eld is restricted to within the coil so that eld tensor f in where

electrons pass is identically zero. if the origin of the space coordinate is chosen at the center

of the coil, the one-form of the gauge eld will be a(x)dx = y/(x2+y2)dx+x/(x2+y2)dy,

which cannot be transformed to zero by a c  gauge transformation because it is not the

dierential of a function over m/(0, 0) [14, p. 6]. hence we have a double-connected region on

m. the interference pattern at each point x on the screen is determined by the amplitude,

|f1(x)exp(cid:18)iez1

dza(z)(cid:19) + f2(x)exp(cid:18)iez2

dza(z)(cid:19) |2

17

= |f1(x)exp(cid:18)ie/2z z

d(z)(a(z)  a(z)(cid:19) + f2(x)|2,

(56)

where the integral domain is over the cross section of the coil, , since the eld strength

vanishes identically outside. the amplitude is invariant under the local gauge transforma-

tions:

(x) = exp (ie(x)) (x),

a

(x) = a(x) + (x),

(57)

(58)

because the eld strength f(x) is gauge invariant.

if a double-connected region can be realized in a non-abelian situation, i.e. the magnetic

eld in the experiment would be taken place by some non-abelian gauge eld and the

electron eld by some fermion eld coupling to the non-abelian gauge eld, the corresponding

amplitude of eq. (56) will be

|p exp(cid:18)iz1

dza(z)(cid:19) f1(x) + p exp(cid:18)iz2

dza(z)(cid:19) f2(x)|2

= |f1(x)|2 + |f2(x)|2 + |

f2(x)p exp(cid:18)ii

dza(z)(cid:19) f1(x) + h.c.|2,

(59)

where  = 1  2 with the point x0 as the initial and nal point. the phase factor here can

be calculated with the help of non-abelian stokes theorem [18,19]:

p exp(cid:18)ii

dza(z)(cid:19) = p exp(cid:18)iz x0

y

a(z)dz(cid:19) p exp(cid:18)i/2z z

d(z)f (y, z)(cid:19)

 p exp(cid:18)iz y

x0

a(z)dz(cid:19) ,

(60)

where y is an arbitrary reference point on , and

f(y, z) = p exp (iz y

z

adx)f(z)p exp (iz z

y

adx).

with regard to eq. (59), the contribution to the amplitude involving the phase factor around

the coil becomes

|

f2(x)g1(x)p exp(cid:18)iz

a

(z)dz(cid:19) g(x)f1(x) + h.c.|2,

18

after the local gauge transformations gt2a and gt2b induced by t(x). here  = c 
s1  c, with s1 the boundary of the coil and c arbitrary path connecting x0 and s1. it
(59) because x 6  and the local gauge

is not equal to the corresponding part in eq.

transformations of the phase factor only involve the gauge group elements on the path , so

the interference pattern is therefore invariant only under global gauge transformation gt1.

without the consideration of the connement of fermions in non-abelian gauge eld theories,

this imaginary experiment demonstrates that only abelian gauge eld theory is a perfect

locally invariant gauge theory in the sense of the denition in sect.(2), i.e. a coordinate-free

description of physics can be realized only in u(1) bundle space.

6 discussions

both in model construction [20-22] and lattice simulation [23], non-perturbative approaches

to qcd widely involves the application of parallel transporter. the closed parallel trans-

porter (wilson loop) is an important tool for the study of the non-perturbative phenomena

such as the connement of quarks (see, e.g. ref.[9, chap. 5]). however, the explicit broken

of the local gauge symmetry of the quantities constructed with this non-local operator, par-

allel transporter, was not understood before. in the perturbative domain, an innitesimal

parallel transporter can be regarded as a good approximation to the real one, because of the

aymptotic freedom property for non-abelian gauge theories. its two-point spinor property

preserves the local gauge invariance gt2 in the perturbative domain. whether the loss of

two-point spinor property of parallel transporter in non-perturbative domain implies some

physics requires our further study.

another issue closely related to gauge symmetry is general covariance in the geometrized

theories of gravitation, e.g. general relativity. in fact the concept of gauge invariance origi-

nated from h. weyls attempt [24] to unify gravitation and electromagnetism in the frame-

work of riemannian geometry. general relativity was rst treated as a gauge theory of

orthonormal frame bundle with the homogeneous lorentz group as the structure group in

ref.[25]. for a conceptual development of gauge concept and geometrization of fundamental

interactions, see ref.[26]. the largest symmetry in spacetime theories is the invariance of the

local eld equations under local coordinate transformation, and people used to believe that

19

this group of diermorphism comprises the gauge freedom of any theory formulated in terms

of tensor elds on a spacetime manifold m, and therefore all diermorphic models of any

spacetime theory represent one and the same physical situation. hence the term general

covariance for a physical theory usually refers to the invariance of local eld equations un-

der coordinate transformation in tangent bundle space. for a genuine equivalence of physics,

however, a tensor eld produced by parallel transport should also be covariant under the

related transformation law. for example, if a physical process involves the parallel trans-

port of a vector eld n(x) between two points, say x1 and x2, on spacetime manifold, the

parallel transporter, p exp(cid:16)r x2

x1 

[5,6]. from the argument in the previous discussion it is true only when the curvature tensor

(x)dx(cid:17), of the vector eld must be a two-point tensor

of the spacetime manifold vanishes identically. generally speaking, the parallel transport of

tensor elds should be an absolute element [27] in any spacetime theory, i.e. the concerned

spacetime transformation should map the parallel transporter as a geometrical object in one

model to the corresponding ones in all its equivalent models, so the models should be geo-

metrically rather than topologically equivalent. this requirement imposes stronger condition

for the general covariance of a theory than that for the form invariance of local lagrangian

density. following the argument in this paper we can show the loss of the property in the

general situation through the analysis of parallel transporters for tensor elds. when studied

from integral point of view, the two most fundamental symmetries, the general covariance

in principal and tangent bundle space, are shown to be much more restricted than what we

see from dierential point of view.

appendix a

in this appendix we prove the two-point spinor property for parallel transporter when

the gauge eld a(x) can be transformed to zero identically. it is in fact to prove

p exp(cid:18)iz x

x0

dza(z)(cid:19) = p exp(cid:18)z x

x0

dzg(z)g1(z)(cid:19) = g(x)g1(x0),

where g(z) = exp(i a(z)t a) = expim(z). we have

g(z)g1(z) =   
xk=0

k!

(im(z))k!   
xk=0

(1)k

k!

(im(z))k! .

(a.1)

(a.2)

substituting it into (a.1). we obtain innitely many terms containing m(z) as the integral

variable, such as r d(m l/l!)((1)n/n!)m n). all these terms can be grouped into the (n+1)-

element sets of the order (i)l+n+x in the form:

z   z si1

t0

d(m l/l!)

(1)k

k!

m kz si

t0

d 

1

(n  k)!

m nk! z    ,

for k = 0, 1,    , n, where the common factors d(cid:16)m l/l!(cid:17) contributes the order (i)l, and
the common part r    the order (i)x. we nd that the terms in such a group cancel all

(1)k(1/k!)(1/(n  k)!) = 0 from the identity

together, because

n

pk=0

(1  1)n = n!  n
xk=0

(1)k 1
k!

1

(n  k)!! = 0.

(a.3)

in this way only the terms on the right hand side of b.(1) will be left.

appendix b

here eq. (33) is proved by the induction on n: if k = 1, then for any dierentiable

function g(t) there is

g(t + t) = g(t) + dg/dt(t)t

under one-order approximation. suppose eq. (33) holds for k = n  1. then we have

and

g (t + (n  1)t) =

dg/dt (t + (n  1)t) =

n1

xk=0  n

k ! (d/dt)kg(t0)(t)k,

n1

xk=0  n

k ! (d/dt)kdg/dt(t0)(t)k.

21

(c.1)

(c.2)

(c.3)

when k = n, it immediately follows that

g (t + nt) = g (t + (n  1)t) + dg/dt (t + (n  1)t) t.

(c.4)

substituting b.2 and b.3 into b.4 and considering the relation

  n
k ! =   n  1

k  1 ! +  n  1

k

! ,

(c.5)

we obtain eq. (33) for k = n after the rearrangement of the terms.

appendix c

first we derive eq. (35) from eq. (34). remember that we suppose g(x) has innite-th

partial derivatives at each point on the path , [t0, t]  m. after the variable t of the

dierentials is changed to x, there are

du
dt

(t) =

dx
dt

(t)g(x),

d2u
dt2 (t) =

d2x
dt2 (t)g(x) +

dx
dt

(t)

dx
dt

(t)g(x),

etc. substituting these results into eq. (34), we obtain the coecient of g(x0) as follows:

(t  t0)

dx
dt

(t0) +

1
2!

(t  t0)2 d2x

dt2 (t0) +    = x  x
0 ,

since the path is a smooth one. all the terms of the higher derivatives in eq. (35) are

obtained in the same way.

on the other hand, if there are continuous n-th partial derivatives of g(x) at each point

of w =

(x  x

0 )  m, then it can be expanded to the n-th order of (x  x

0 ) with

respect to the spacetime variables. however, with some points z 6  but  w , at which the

n

q=1

continuous partial derivatives exist only up to the m(< n  1)-th, g(x) cannot be certainly

expanded in the form:

g(x) = g(x0) +

n1

xk=1

1

k!  (x  x

0 )



x!k

g(x0) +

1

n!  (x  x

0 )



x!n

g(),

where  is some point in w .

as an example, we perform the local gauge transformation g(x, y) = exp (

where a(x, y) are c  functions, on two-dimensional plane x-y. g(x, y) is a c 1 function over

the domain w = [0, 1]  [0, 1] if there are a  w 6=  for some curves a determined by the

equations, a(x, y) = 0. consider a smooth path  connecting the point (0, 0) to (1, 1), with

  a =  for all as. then u(t) is c  on . from the taylor expansion of u(t) we have

g(1, 1) = g(0, 0) +



xk=1

g(0, 0),

whereas the taylor expansion of a c 1 function g(x, y) on w only denitely gives

g(1, 1) = g(0, 0) + (

y

)g(1, 2),

where (1, 2) is some point in w . therefore, it is concluded that the coincidence of the two

taylor expansions eq. (34) and eq. (35) requires the same behavior of g(x) on  and w .
