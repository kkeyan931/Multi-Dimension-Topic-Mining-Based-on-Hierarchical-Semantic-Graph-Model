abstract

we develop further the theory of rational conformal field theories (rcfts) on a
cylinder with specied boundary conditions emphasizing the role of a triplet of alge-
bras: the verlinde, graph fusion and pasquier algebras. we show that solving cardys
equation, expressing consistency of a rcft on a cylinder, is equivalent to nding inte-
ger valued matrix representations of the verlinde algebra. these matrices allow us to
naturally associate a graph g to each rcft such that the conformal boundary condi-
tions are labelled by the nodes of g. this approach is carried to completion for s(2)
theories leading to complete sets of conformal boundary conditions, their associated
cylinder partition functions and the a-d-e classication. we also review the current
status for wzw s(3) theories. finally, a systematic generalization of the formalism
of cardy-lewellen is developed to allow for multiplicities arising from more general
representations of the verlinde algebra. we obtain information on the bulk-boundary
coecients and reproduce the relevant algebraic structures from the sewing constraints.

introduction

1.1 history and motivation

the subject of boundary conformal eld theory has a fairly long history. it was born more
than ten years ago, in parallel work on open string theory [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and on
conformal eld theories (cfts) describing critical systems with boundaries [9]. the work
of cardy [10] was a landmark, leading to the unication of methods, to the introduction of
important concepts such as boundary conformal elds and to the systematic investigation of
their properties and couplings [11, 12]. the subject remained dormant for some time, in spite
of some activity motivated again by string theory [13, 14] and of beautiful applications to the
kondo problem [15, 16]. lately, the subject has undergone a revival of interest in connection
with various problems. on the one hand, work on boundary conditions in integrable eld
theories and boundary ows [17, 18, 19] and on quantum impurities [20, 21] motivated a
closer look at boundary cft. on the other hand, within statistical mechanics, integrable
boltzmann weights satisfying the so-called boundary yang-baxter equation (bybe) were
constructed in lattice models [22, 23]. finally new progress in string theory was another
reason to reconsider the problem. generalizations of d-branes as boundary conditions in
cft have been studied by several groups [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29].

in the present work, we want to reconsider several issues in the discussion of boundary
conditions in (rational) conformal eld theories: what are the general boundary conditions
that may be imposed, what are the structure constants of the bulk and boundary elds in
the presence of these boundary conditions. these are the basic questions that we want to
address. the methods that we use are not essentially new, but are based on the systematic
exploitation of the work of cardy and lewellen [10, 11, 12].

among the main results of this paper:

 we establish a connection between the classication of boundary conditions and the
classication of integer valued representations of the fusion algebra. a preliminary
account of this result was given in [30, 31]. in the same vein, we show that it is natural
to associate graphs to these problems. in particular, an ade classication of boundary
conditions for wess-zumino-witten (wzw) and minimal sl(2) theories emerges in a
natural and simple way. a discussion of the state of the art for sl(3) models is also
included.

 we point out the deep connections between the features of conformal eld theory in
the bulk and in the presence of boundaries. the classication of the latter has some
bearing on the classication of the bulk properties (modular invariants etc). this is
not a new observation. in particular, in string theory many connections are known
to exist between open and closed string sectors, but it seems that the point had not
been stressed enough. a triplet of algebras, specically the graph fusion algebra and its
dual, the pasquier algebra, appears naturally in our discussion, along with the verlinde

2

algebra.

 we reanalyse in a systematic way the couplings (structure constants) of elds in the
presence of boundaries and the equations they satisfy, generalising the formalism of
cardy-lewellen to accomodate the appearance of nontrivial multiplicities. in the di-
agonal cases we nd a direct relation between the chiral duality identities of moore
and seiberg and the basic sewing relations of the boundary cft. the main point is
the observation that the bulk boundary coecients in the diagonal case essentially
coincide with the matrices s(j) of modular transformations of torus 1-point functions.
in this way the two basic bulkboundary equations [11, 12] are shown to be equivalent
to the torus duality identity of [32].

some more particular results include the extension of cardys equation to non-specialized
characters, thus lifting an ambiguity in the original derivation, the proof of uniqueness of

boundary conditions for bsl(2) wzw and minimal models and bsl(n)1 models, the clarica-

tion of the role of the graph algebra and the recovery of this algebra along with its dual, the
pasquier algebra, from the boundary sewing constraints.

1.2 background on bulk cft

in this paper, we are only concerned with rational conformal field theories (rcfts). we
rst establish notations etc.
in the study of a rcft, one rst species a chiral algebra
a. it is the virasoro algebra or one of its extensions: current algebra, w algebra etc. the
generators of this algebra will be denoted generically wn and include the virasoro generators
ln. at a given level, the theory is rational, i.e. a has only a nite set i of irreducible
representations vi, i  i. the label i indexes the representation conjugate to i, and i = 1
refers to the identity (or vacuum) representation. we also suppose that the characters
i(q) = tr viql0 c
24 of these representations, the matrix s of modular transformations of the
k of the vs are all known. the matrix sij is symmetric
s and the fusion coecients nij
and unitary and satises s2 = c, where c is the conjugation matrix cij = ji. the fusion
coecients are assumed to be given in terms of s by the verlinde formula

nij

k =xi

sisjsk

s1

,

(1.1)

an assumption that rules out some cases of rcfts.

a physical conformal theory is then dened by a collection of bulk and boundary elds
and their 3-point couplings (ope coecients). in particular, the spectrum of bulk elds
is described by the nite set spec of pairs (j, j) of representations, possibly appearing with
some multiplicities njj, of the left and right copies of a, such that the hilbert space of the
theory on an innitely long cylinder reads

h = (j,j)specvj  v j ,

3

(1.2)

with the same multiplicities nj,j. the modular invariant torus partition function

ztorus =xj,j

njjj(q)(cid:16)j(q)(cid:17)

(1.3)

is a convenient way to encode this information. the nite subset e of labels of elements of
the spectrum that are left-right symmetric will play a central role in the following

e = {j|(j, j = j)  spec} ,

(1.4)

and will be called the set of exponents of the theory. recall that these exponents may come
with some multiplicities. to distinguish them as dierent elements of the set e a second
index will be often added, i.e., (j, )  e , for j  i.

in terms of all these data, one is in principle able to compute exactly all correlation
functions of the cft on an arbitrary 2d surface, with or without boundaries [33, 32, 12].
these data, however, are subject to consistency constraints: single-valuedness of n-point
functions on the plane, modular invariance of the torus or annulus partition function, etc,
all rooted in the locality properties of the theory.
in this paper, we shall reexamine the
conditions that stem from surfaces with boundaries (half-plane or disk, cylinder or annulus)
and explore their consequences.

for later reference, let us also recall that rcfts fall in two classes. in the rst class
(type i), the hilbert space (1.2) is a diagonal sum of representations of a larger, extended,
algebra a  a. accordingly, the partition function (1.3) is a sum of squares of sums of
characters

z = xblocks b |xib

i|2 .

(1.5)

the second class (type ii) is obtained from the rst by letting an automorphism  of the
fusion rules of the extended algebra a act on the right components, thus resulting in a
non-block-diagonal partition function

z =xb (cid:16)xib

i(cid:17)(cid:16) xj(b)

j(cid:17) .

(1.6)

for example, in the classical case of s(2) theories, classied by a-d-e dynkin diagrams,
the a, d2p, e6 and e8 cases are of the rst type, whereas the d2p+1 and e7 are obtained
respectively from the a4p1 and d10 cases by a z2 automorphism of their fusion rules. we
shall see below that the study of boundary conditions on a cylinder has some bearing on
these expressions of torus partition functions.

2.1 boundary states

as discussed in [34], on the boundary of a domain such as the upper half plane or a semi-
innite cylinder, one must impose a continuity condition of the form

t (z) = t (z)|z=z

w (z) = w (z)|z=z .

(2.1)

while the rst of these conditions has the direct physical meaning of the absence of energy-
momentum ow across the boundary, or the preservation of the real boundary by dieo-
morphisms, the condition(s) on the other w may be generalized to incorporate a possible
gluing automorphism [35, 24]

w (z) = w (z)|z=z .

(2.2)

a semi-annular domain in the upper half-plane may be conformally mapped into an annulus
in the complex plane by  = exp(2iw/t ), w = l
 log z. then as shown by ishibashi [2]
and cardy [10], the boundary condition becomes

 2t () = 

2

t ()

 sw w () = ()sw w ()

for || = 1

(2.3)

where sw denotes the spin of w , or more generally

 sw w () = ()sw w () .

through radial quantization, this translates into a condition on boundary states |ai

(cid:16)wn  (1)sw (w n)(cid:17)|ai = 0 .

this includes in particular the condition that

(ln  ln)|ai = 0 ,

(2.4)

(2.5)

assuming that the automorphism  keeps invariant the virasoro generators. for the central
charge operator we have (k  k)|ai = 0 irrespective of the spin s.
solutions to this linear system are spanned by special states called ishibashi states [2],
labelled by the nite set e = {j|(j, j = (j))  spec}, where  depends in particular on
. to see this, let us consider rst the simpler equation (2.5) in the case when a is the
virasoro algebra and  is trivial. then observe that one may solve (2.5) in each component
of (1.2) independently, as these spaces are invariant under the action of the two copies of

a. now we recall that any state a = pn,n an,n|j, ni  |j, ni in vj  vj is in one-to-one
correspondence with a homomorphism xa = pn,n an,n|j, ni  hj, n| of vj into vj. this
uses the scalar product in vj. since ln = ln for that scalar product, (2.5) implies that
lnxa = xaln, i.e. that xa intertwines the action of ln in the two representations vj
and vj of the virasoro algebra. as these two representations are irreducible, they must be
equivalent, which by our convention on the labelling of representations, means that j = j.

5

thus the only non-vanishing components of a in h are in diagonal products vj  vj and in
each one, xa is proportional to the projector pj = pn |j, nihj, n|. to x the normalization
we choose xa = pj and the corresponding ishibashi state is denoted |jii. this completes
the proof 2 that there is an independent boundary state |jii for each element of the set
e = {j|(j, j = j)  spec}.
the argument is a formal extension of the proof, based on the schur lemma, of the
existence and uniqueness of an invariant in the tensor product of nite dimensional rep-
resentations.
it extends to the odd spin sw case (2.4). we have to use the fact that
w n = (1)sw u1 wn u with respect to a bilinear (or hermitian) form where u is a uni-
tary (or antiunitary) operator. one exploits the same denition of the homomorphism
xa : vj  vj, now vj ,vj being highest weight representations of the chiral algebra a
generated by wn. however xa corresponds to states in vj  u u vj, where u is a unitary
(antiunitary) operator implementing the automorphism (wn) = u wn u1
 . the equation
(2.4) leads to wnxa = xawn again with the result j = j and xa = pj while the ishibashi

states are given by |jii =pn |j, ni  u u |j, ni.
the operator u is in general non-trivial, e.g., for the bsl(n)k wzw theories w n =
w(wn) where w is the horizontal projection of the chevalley involution of the ane algebra
[36], i.e., it is determined by w(ei) = f i , w(f i) = ei , for the simple roots i of
sl(n), where e/f  are raising/lowering operators respectively, and for the cartan generators
w(hi) = hi , i = 1, 2, . . . , n 1. the pair (j, (j)) characterising e refers to the eigenvalues
of hi on the rst term in |jii.
if  = w0, where
w0 represents the longest element of the weyl group, then w0(j) = j and hence (j) =
w0w(j) = j. on the other hand (j) = j for  coinciding with the chevalley automorphism
 = w. in the last two of these examples we can identify v j = u u vj with a highest weight
module v(j) , (j)  i. it should be stressed that all these automorphisms  keep invariant
the sugawara virasoro generators so the condition (2.5) is also satised on the corresponding
ishibashi states.

if  is the identity, then (j) = j.

we shall hereafter drop the explicit dependence on .

in fact we still have to dene a norm (or a scalar product) on boundary states, in
particular on the ishibashi states. we have to face two diculties. first because of the
innite dimension of the representation vj, the most naive norm, proportional to tr pj,
would be innite. the second problem concerns non-unitary representations. in such cases,
the hermitian form on vj is not positive denite, and we may encounter signs in the norm
of states.

the rst problem requires some regularization of the naive norm. let q

a real number, 0 < q < 1. then hhj|q

elements had appeared already in m. bauers phd thesis (1989).

6

the norm of |jii should then be some renormalized version of the q  1 limit of (2.6)
[2, 10], i.e., of the limit in which q = e2i , the modular transform of q, tends to 0. in unitary
theories, a new scalar product on boundary states may be dened according to

24 j(q) = jj s1j ,

(2.7)

where we have used the fact that in a unitary theory, the leading character in the q  0
limit is that of the identity operator 1(q)  q c
24 . note that sj1 is, up to a factor 1/s11, the
quantum dimension of the representation j, a positive number. thus in unitary theories the
normalization chosen for xj is such that the states |jii are orthogonal for the scalar product
(2.7), with a square norm equal to s1j. although in non-unitary theories the limit q  0
in (2.7) does not exist in general, due to the existence of representations of conformal weight
hi < 0 that will dominate that limit, we may still dene the norm by the same formula as
(2.7). alternatively, if j0 denotes the unique representation of smallest conformal weight
hj0 < 0 belonging to e, and ce := c  24hj0, then we may dene

hhjkjii = jj

in the sequel, we use more compact notations and the

multiplicity label  will be implicit when referring to j  e.

the most general boundary state |ai satisfying condition (2.4) must be a linear combi-

nation of these ishibashi states, which, for later convenience, we write as

|ai =xje

j

aqs1j |jii .

(2.10)

we denote by v = {a} the set labelling the boundary states. we assume that an involution
a  a in the set v is dened and that j
a), where j  j is an involution in
e (in general (j, )  (j, ), see appendix b for examples). we dene conjugate states
as

a = j

a = (j

.

(2.11)

hb| :=xje

as explained in [24], this conjugate state may be regarded as resulting from the action of an
antilinear cpt operation. as a consequence

so that the orthonormality of the boundary states is equivalent to that of the s.

in some cases, such as in the computation of partition functions involving the specialised
characters in the next section, it is sucient to impose only the virasoro condition (2.5)
on the boundary states. then the sum in (2.10), when interpreted in terms of ishibashi
states pertaining to some extended symmetry, may include states |jii with dierent .
for example, in the minimal bsl(2) models when multiplicities occur in e, one can build
the ishibashi states using the coulomb gas realisation with a = bu(1). then there are two
choices of  keeping ln invariant. this allows, in particular, the construction of two dierent
ishibashi states with the same value of the scaling dimension, i.e., the explicit resolution of
the degeneracy of states denoted |j, ii above. such mixtures of ishibashi states may be
used in determining the boundary states of the non-diagonal (a, deven) models.

2.2 the cardy equation

we now consider a conformal eld theory on a nite cylinder. following cardy, the partition
function may be expressed in two alternative ways. regarded as resulting from the evolution
of the system between boundary states a and b under the action of the hamiltonian on (i.e.
the translation operator along) the cylinder, it is

zb|a = hb|(q

1

2 )l0+ l0 c

12|ai

(2.13)

where q

t describes the aspect-ratio of the cylinder of period t and length l as

figure 1: the two computations of the partition function zb|a: (a) on the cylinder, between the
boundary states a and b, (b) as a periodic time evolution on the strip, with boundary conditions a
and b.

in figure 1. decomposing the boundary states on the ishibashi basis and using (2.6), one
obtains

(2.14)

zb|a =xje

a (j
j

b )

j(q)
sj1

where the states |jii are admissible ishibashi states of the system, i.e., the label j runs over
the set e.

8

on the other hand, zb|a may be regarded as resulting from the periodic time evolution
under the action of the translation operator along the nite width strip in the presence
of boundary conditions a and b. the latter manifest themselves only in the nature of the
hilbert space hba and its decomposition into representations of a single chiral algebra: hba =
inib
l , zb|a is a linear form in
the characters

avi with non-negative integer multiplicities nib

a. if q = e t

zb|a =xii

i(q)nib

a .

(2.15)

we choose to write the modular transformation of characters in the form i(q) =

pj sijj(q), hence j(q) = pi sjii(q) . provided that specialized characters i(q) are

considered, this complex conjugation is immaterial, since i(q) = i(q). we shall, however,
make later use of unspecialized characters (appendix a), for which it does matter. with
this convention, and assuming for the time being the independence of characters, the two
expressions (2.14) and (2.15) are consistent provided

nia

b =xje

sij
s1j

a (j
j

b) .

(2.16)

in the sequel we will refer to this as the cardy equation. in the left hand side, we have used
the rst of the following symmetries

nia

b = nib

a = nib

a

,

(2.17)

which follow from the properties of the modular matrix and of the coecients j
a.

the boundary states |ai, |bi, are thus such that nia

b is a non-negative integer. unique-
b  1. the cardy equation (2.16) is a non-linear constraint
ness of the vacuum implies n1a
on the components of boundary states |ai and |bi on the basis of ishibashi states. note
also that it implies that pi nib
asji vanishes if j / e and, except in cases with multiplicities,
must factorize into a product of contributions of the a and b boundary states, a non-trivial
constraint. still, these constraints seem dicult to solve in full generality.

before we proceed, we have to pause on the question of independence of characters.
in general, it is not true that specialized characters such as those that we have been using
so far, are linearly independent. for instance, complex conjugate representations i and i
give rise to the same character i(q). unfortunately, little is known about unspecialized
characters for general chiral algebras, beside the case of ane algebras. in appendix a, we
show that in the case of rational conformal eld theories with a current algebra, the previous
discussion may indeed be repeated if the energy momentum tensor of the theory has been
modied in such a way that unspecialized characters appear. then using the known modular
transformations of the latter [36], one derives (2.16). we shall therefore assume that (2.16)
holds true for general rcft.

we now return to the cardy equation (2.16), and assume that we have found an or-

9

thonormal set of boundary states, i.e.

satisfying

a(j
j

b) = ab .

xje

(2.18)

moreover we make the stronger assumption that we have found a complete set of such states,
i.e.

satisfying

a(j
j

a ) = jj .

(2.19)

xa

(note that this implies that the number of these boundary states must be equal to the
cardinality of e).

finally we recall that the ratios sij/s1j, for a xed j  i, form a one-dimensional

representation of the fusion algebra, as a consequence of the verlinde formula (1.1):

si1j
s1j

si2j
s1j

= xi3i

ni1i2

i3 si3j
s1j

.

it follows from (2.19), (2.20) that the matrices ni, dened by

also satisfy the (commuting) fusion algebra

(ni)a

b = nia

b

i  i

ni1ni2 = xi3i

ni1i2

i3ni3 .

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

by (2.18), n1 = i, the unit matrix, and by (2.17), ni = nt
i .

conversely, given a set of matrices with non-negative integer elements, satisfying ni =
nt
i , n1 = i and the fusion algebra, they form a commuting set, and thus each ni commutes
with its transpose. these matrices are thus normal matrices that may be diagonalized in an
orthonormal basis. their eigenvalues are of the form sij/s1j for some j, and they may thus
be written in the form (2.16). if one pretends to determine the spectrum e from the ns, one
has to impose also that j = 1 appears only once in e, as a manifestation of the uniqueness
of the vacuum.

we thus conclude that the search for orthonormal and complete solutions to the cardy
equation is equivalent to the search for n valued representations of the fusion algebra satis-
fying nt

i = ni.

this is the rst important result of this paper, already presented succinctly in [31]. the
fact that some solutions to the cardy equation were associated with representations of the
fusion algebra had been noticed before. in his seminal paper [10], cardy considered the case
of diagonal theories (for which e = i) and showed that the ni matrices were nothing other
than the fusion matrices ni, thus obtaining an alternative and more intuitive derivation of
the verlinde formula. in an antecedent work by saleur and bauer [9], other solutions had
been obtained in non-diagonal theories, starting from their lattice realization, and the fact

10

that these ni coecients satised the fusion rules had been emphasized in [37]. more recently
sagnotti and stanev [29] proposed a dierent argument to the same eect, where a notion
of completeness of boundary conditions is also playing a crucial role.

solutions such that all matrices ni may be written as ni = (n1)i  (n2)i after the
same suitable permutation of rows and columns can be called reducible. they describe
sets of decoupled boundary conditions. we thus restrict our attention to irreducible sets of
matrices.

2.3 wzw s(2) theories

fying representations of the fusion algebra was solved long ago [37]. the integrable highest

for theories with the ane (current) algebra bsl(2) as a chiral algebra, the problem of classi-
weight representations of bsl(2)k at level k  n are labelled by an integer 1  j  k + 1,
sij =q 2

k+2 and the cardy equation says that the generator n2 = n2 has eigenvalues
s2j
k+2. the only symmetric irreducible matrices with non-negative integer entries
s1j
and eigenvalues less than 2 are the adjacency matrices of a-d-e-t graphs [38] of figure 2.
the tadpole graphs are given by tn := a2n/z2. here the level k is related to the coxeter
number by g = k + 2. only the a-d-e solutions are retained as their spectrum matches the

k+2 sin ij

= 2 cos j

spectrum of bsl(2) theories, known by their modular invariant partition functions [39]. for
a theory classied by a dynkin diagram g of a-d-e type, the set e is the set of coxeter
exponents of g as in table 1. the matrices ni are then dened recursively by n1 = i, n2 = g
and by equation (2.22) which reduces here to ni+1 = n2nini1, i = 2, 3, . . . , k. they are the
well known fused adjacency matrices or intertwiners vi, studied in [37, 46] and whose
properties are recalled in appendix b. one veries that all their entries are non-negative

integers. this set of complete orthonormal solutions of the cardy equation for bsl(2) theories
is unique up to a relabelling of the states |ai.

2.4 minimal s(2) models

the classication of c < 1 minimal models in the bulk is given in terms of a pair of dynkin
diagrams (a, g) where g is of a-d-e type [39]. let h be the coxeter number of ah1 and
g the coxeter number of g as given in table 1. then the complete a-d-e classication is

m(a, g) =

g even

m(ah1, ag1)
m(ah1, d(g+2)/2),
m(ah1, e6)
m(ah1, e7)
m(ah1, e8)



with h, g  2 and central charges given by
c = 1

we will use m(a, g) to denote these minimal theories. since g and h must be coprime and
g is even for all non-a cases, one may always assume, at the price of a possible interchange
in the (a, a) case, that h is odd, h = 2p + 1.

some members of these series are identied as follows:

m(a2, a3) = critical ising
m(a4, a3) = tricritical ising
m(a4, d4) = critical 3-state potts
m(a6, d4) = tricritical 3-state potts

c = 1/2
c = 7/10
c = 4/5
c = 6/7

(2.25)

we will use g to denote both the dynkin diagram and its adjacency matrix. we use
r, r1, r2 to denote nodes or exponents of ah1; s, s1, s2 for the nodes (or exponents) of ag1;
a, a1, a2, b for the nodes of g. we refer the reader to appendix b for more data on these
matrices and their eigenvectors.

if exp(g) denotes the set of exponents of g (see table 1), the modular invariant partition

function of m(ah1, g) reads

z =

1
2

h1xr=1 xsexp(g) |rs(q)|2 + o-diagonal terms .

(2.26)

the factor 1
2 removes the double counting due to the well-known identication of the (r, s)
and (h  r, g  s) representations of the virasoro algebra. the diagonal terms in z, i.e. the
left-right symmetric (highest weight) states in the spectrum are thus labelled by the set

e = {j = (r, s)  (h  r, g  s); 1  r  h  1; s  exp(g)} .

(2.27)

each of the unitary minimal models m(ah1, g) with g  h = 1 can be realized
as the continuum scaling limit of an integrable two-dimensional lattice model at criticality,
with heights living on the nodes of the graph g.
in particular, the critical series with
g  h = 1 is associated with the a-d-e lattice models [41, 42] and the tricritical series with
g  h = 1 is associated with the dilute lattice models [43, 44]. in the non-unitary cases
the associated lattice models [45] possess negative boltzmann weights. in the construction
of the corresponding lattice models as well as in the description of boundary conditions, it
turns out that the two diagrams of the pair (a, g) do not play a symmetric role.

according to the discussion of the previous section, we have to study the fusion algebras
of minimal models and their (integer-valued) representations. the verlinde formula for the
fusion coecients makes use of the matrix s of modular transformations of characters

(2.28)

with the restriction r, r odd (or any equivalent condition). the fusion coecients are then

found to be tensor products of those relative to the bsl(2) algebras of level h  2 and g  2,
up to a symmetrization which accounts for the identication (r, s)  (h  r, g  s)

this may be regarded as the regular representation of the fusion matrices nrs of the virasoro
algebra of central charge (2.24). our problem is to nd the general non-negative integer
valued representations of this algebra. one observes that nrs = nr1n1s and that the algebra
is thus generated by n21 and n12. also, the eigenvalues of n12 and n21 are of the form

s12,rs

(2.30)

(2.31)

with 1  r  h  1, 1  s  g  1 and again (r, s)  (h  r, g  s).

turning now to a general (integer valued) representation nrs of the fusion algebra, it
is still true that it is generated by n12 and n21. in addition, we want the spectrum of the
nrs to be specied by the set of exponents e of (2.23), that is (r, s) in (2.30-2.31), with
the eigenvalues labelled by s appearing with some multiplicity in general. to remove the
redundancy in the labelling of eigenvalues, we will usually take r odd, r = 1, 3,   , h  2,
and (s, )  exp(g). in the sequel, we will drop this explicit notation for multiplicities. we
know of course a solution to this problem, namely

nrs = nr  vs + nhr  vgs

(2.32)

in terms of the fusion matrices n of bsl(2) at level h  2 and of the intertwiners v of type g

introduced in the previous subsection (see also appendix b). more explicitly, this describes
a solution to the cardy equation between boundary states (r1, a) and (r2, b)

nrs;(r1,a)

(r2,b) = nrr1

r2vsa

(2.33)

with 1  r, r1, r2  h 1 = 2p, 1  s  g  1, and a, b running over the nodes of the dynkin
diagram g.

because of the properties of the n and v matrices recalled in appendix b, it is readily

seen that

nrs;(r1,a)

(r2,b) = nrs;(r1,a)

(hr2,(b)) = nrs;(hr1,(a))

(r2,b)

(2.34)

for an automorphism  acting on the nodes of the graph g: this is the identity except for the
a, dodd and e6 cases, for which it is the natural z2 symmetry of the diagram. we conclude
that this solution describes boundary states of m(ah1, g) labelled by pairs (r, a) of nodes
of the ah1 and of the g graph, with the identication
(r, a)  (h  r, (a)).

(2.35)

one checks that the number of independent boundary states |(r, a)i is

number of independent boundary states =

1
2

(h  1)n

(2.36)

14

with n the number of nodes of g, or the number of its exponents. this number (2.36)
coincides with the number of independent left-right symmetric highest weight states |r, si
|r, si in the spectrum of the theory on a cylinder, i.e. with the cardinality of the set e, as it
should.

with such boundary states, the cylinder partition function reads

z(r1,a)|(r2,b) = z(r2,b)|(r1,a) = z(r1,a)|(hr2,(b)) =xr,s

rs(q)nrr1

(2.37)

here the sum runs over 1  r  h  1, 1  s  g  1.

let us look more closely at (2.33). there exists a basis in which (2.33) takes a factorized
form. indeed one may use the identications (r, s)  (h  r, g  s) and (2.35) to restrict
r2 = 0, the r.h.s. of (2.33)
r, r1, r2 to odd values (recall that h = 2p + 1 is odd). then nhrr1
factorizes and the following expressions

(r,a) = 2srrs
(rs)
a ,

r, r odd, s  exp(g) ,

(2.38)

written in terms of the modular matrix of bsl(2) at level h  2 and of eigenvectors  of g,
are readily seen to be eigenvectors of nrs. their eigenvalue is of the form srs,rs/s11,rs after
some reshuing r, s  r, s.

one also shows (see appendix c) that there exists a basis in which

n12 = ip  g =

in terms of the tadpole tp adjacency matrix and of , the matrix that realizes the automor-
phism : a

b = a(b) .

conversely, suppose we only know that the representation nrs has a spectrum specied
by the set of exponents e. the question is: are these spectral data sucient to guarantee
that the only nrs are of the form (2.33) in a certain basis? a proof of this fact is relegated to
appendix c. notice that our discussion has assumed the classication of modular invariants

to be known. it should be possible to extend it as in the case of wzw bsl(2) models and to

classify the representations of the verlinde algebra without this information. a few spurious
cases involving tadpoles etc. would then have to be discarded.

to recapitulate, we have proved that the only representations of the fusion algebra of
minimal models are given by (2.33). to our knowledge, this is the rst proof of the uniqueness
of these (complete orthonormal) boundary states of minimal models.

15

some physical intuition about the meaning of these boundary conditions may be helpful.
for this we appeal to the lattice realization of the minimal model as a generalized height
model on the graph g (see [30]). a boundary condition of the type (1, a) describes a xed
boundary condition, where the height of the model is xed to value a on the graph. the
interpretation of the other label r is less intuitive. the boundary condition (r, a) is realized
by attaching an r-times fused weight to height a.

the expression (2.37) for the cylinder partition function encompasses and generalizes

cases that were already known:

 from the work of saleur and bauer [9] who discussed boundary conditions in lattice
height models of a-d-e type on a cylinder in which the heights on the boundaries
are xed to the values a respectively b. they showed that in the continuum limit, the
partition function reads

zb|a =xs

vsa

b1s .

 from the work of cardy [10] who showed how to construct new boundary conditions

by fusion.

 from the work of pasquier and saleur [47], who interpreted the pair of relations

(1b)|(1a) = x 1sv b

z (ah1,g)
z (ah1,ag1)

sa

(1,s)|(1,1)

(2.41)

(2.42)

as expressing the decomposition of the representation of the temperley-lieb algebra
on the space of paths from a to b on graph g onto the irreducible ones on the paths
from 1 to s on graph ag1, see point (ii) at the end of appendix b.
examples

let us illustrate these expressions of boundary states by a few simple cases. in the ising
model (the (a2, a3) minimal model), h = 3, g = a3, thus n = 3 and there are 1
2(31)3 = 3
boundary states, generally denoted [10] +, and f . on the lattice, the rst two describe
xed boundary conditions on the spin  = 1 or 1 respectively, while f corresponds to free
boundary conditions.

it is then instructive to consider two related examples, see also [21, 27]. the rst is

the c = 2 d4 solution of bsl(2)4 at level 4, and the other is its cousin, the c = 4/5 minimal

(3-state potts) model, already mentioned in section 2.4 and labelled by the pair (a4, d4).
in the former case, we nd four boundary states, labelled by 1 to 4, that we attach to
the nodes of the d4 diagram. all these states satisfy the required boundary conditions.

the set of exponents is e = {1, 3, 3, 5}. but this d4 bsl(2) model is also known to result
from the conformal embedding of bsl(2)4 into bsl(3)1. regarded as an bsl(3) theory, the model
admits three boundary states satisfying the more restrictive bsl(3) conditions (ln ln)|ai =
(jn + jn)|ai = 0, where the choice of  corresponds to the diagonal set (j, j). these

16

three boundary states may be regarded as the three nodes of a triangular graph a(4) (see
appendix d and figure 10), or as the three extremal nodes of the d4 diagram that have
survived the additional bsl(3) constraint.

the discussion of the potts model is quite parallel. from the minimal model standpoint,

it is the (a4, d4) model, h = 5, n = 4 and there are 8 boundary states [21, 27]:

a = (1, 1) = (4, 1),

b = (1, 3) = (4, 3),

c = (1, 4) = (4, 4)

bc = (2, 1) = (3, 1), ac = (2, 3) = (3, 3), ab = (2, 4) = (3, 4)

(2.43)

abc = (1, 2) = (4, 2), n = (2, 2) = (3, 2)

on the lattice, the rst three a, b, c describe xed boundary conditions where the spin
takes at each site of the boundary one of the three possible values. the mixed boundary
conditions ab, bc, ac describe boundary conditions where the spin on the boundary can
take on two values independently. the boundary conditions abc and n are free boundary
conditions but for n the weights depend on whether adjacent spins are equal or not.

the model may also be regarded as the simplest w3 model. in that picture, one may
impose more stringent boundary conditions. only the six states denoted above a, b, c, ab,
bc, ac satisfy the additional condition (w (3)
n)|ai = 0. they correspond to the
extremal nodes of the pair (t2, d4) or, alternatively, to the nodes of the pair (t2,a(4)). as
will be discussed in more detail in section 3, the subset of these nodes, to be denoted t , can
be identied in both examples with the representation labels of the corresponding extended
chiral algebra. the matrix elements j
=

a for a  t satisfy [51] the general relation j
as1j

n + w (3)

sext

{1}{j}

and sext
a{j}
sext

a{j}qsext
p{j}

, where {j} denotes the orbit of the exponent j with respect to the z2 automorphism
is the verlinde matrix of the extended theory. this relation implies that |ai =
{1}{j} pj{j} |jii, i.e., we can identifypj{j} |jii = |{j}ii with an extended ishibashi
a{j}qsext

state. the missing boundary condition corresponds to a twisted boundary condition from
the point of view of the extended algebra.

we conclude that, as expected, the number and nature of the boundary states reect

the precise conditions that they are supposed to satisfy.

3 . graph fusion algebras

according to the discussion of section 2, given a certain chiral algebra a, the sets of complete
orthonormal boundary states of rcfts consistent with this algebra are classied by repre-
sentations of the verlinde algebra of a, on matrices ni with non-negative integral entries.
or stated dierently: given a certain rcft with a chiral algebra a, the sets of complete
orthonormal boundary states of this theory consistent with this algebra are classied by rep-
resentations of the verlinde algebra of a, on matrices ni with non-negative integral entries,

17

with eigenvalues specied by the diagonal part e of the spectrum. these matrices may thus
be regarded as the adjacency matrices of a collection of |i| graphs. in practice, it is sucient
to look at the smaller number of matrices representing the generators of the fusion ring. for
example, one matrix in the case of sl(2) considered above, or the n  1 matrices associated
with the fundamental representations, in the case of sl(n).

the simplest case is given by the regular representation of the fusion algebra, when
the matrices ni are the verlinde matrices themselves, ni = ni. this is the case of so-
called diagonal theories, when all representations of the set i appear once in the spectrum
spec = {(i, i)|i  i}. this may be regarded as the case of reference from several points
of view:
it was the rst case analysed in detail [10]; the corresponding graphs are playing
a central role; and nally in that case, cardy was able to provide a physical argument
explaining why the fusion matrices arise naturally. it is the purpose of this section to extend
these considerations to more general solutions. we shall nd that the role of the fusion
matrices in the arguments of cardy is now played by two sets of matrices. the rst is the
set of matrices ni that describe the coecients of the cylinder partition function; the second
is a new set of matrices na, forming what is called the graph fusion algebra.

on the other hand, since we know that the cylinder partition functions, or equivalently
the matrices ni, contain some information about the bulk theory, through the knowledge
of the diagonal spectrum e, it is expected that this classication of boundary conditions
should have some bearing on the classication of bulk theories, namely on the classication
of torus partition functions and on bulk structure constants. remarkably, this programme
works even better than expected and the two classication problems seem to be essentially
equivalent, at least for type i theories (see end of section 1). this will be explained in
section 3.3 below.

3.1 more on graphs and intertwiners

suppose we have found a solution to the cardy equation, namely a set of n  n matrices
b, i = 1,   ,|i|, a, b = 1,   , n. what was said in detail in section 2 and in
(2.16), (ni)a
appendix b in the case of bsl(2) can be repeated here. as their entries are non-negative
integers, these matrices may be regarded as adjacency matrices of a set of |i| graphs gi,
with n = |gi|  |g| nodes. we shall refer collectively to these |i| graphs as the graph
g, whereas the basic solution provided by the ns themselves will be called the a graph,
(borrowing the notation from the s(2) case). the eigenvalues of the matrices ni are specied
by a set exp(g) in the sense that they are of the form sij/s1j, (j, )  exp(g). moreover
exp(g) = e if the rcft is given and the diagonal spectrum e is known. but in general,
the determination of the set exp(g) is part of the problem. the fundamental relation
pb(ni)a
 regarded as |g|  |g| matrices, the matrices ni form a representation of the fusion

c may be interpreted in two ways:

k(nk)a

algebra (2.22).

18

 regarded as a |i|  |g| rectangular matrix, each matrix na for a xed, (na)j

b := nja
intertwines the representatives ni and ni in the two representations nina = nani, or
more explicitly

b

nij

knka

nja

bnib

c .

(3.1)

xk

c =xb

we shall thus occasionally refer to the matrices ni as intertwiners.

the case of graphs and intertwiners pertaining to bsl(2) theories has been discussed at
length in section 2 and in appendix b. in appendix d, we outline the discussion of bsl(3).

in that case, the fusion algebra is generated by two matrices n(2,1) and n(1,2) (labelled by the
two fundamental (shifted) weights of sl(3)), and as these two representations are complex
conjugate to one another, the matrices ni are related by transposition n(2,1) = nt
(1,2) . then
according to (2.22), ni is given by the same polynomial of n(1,2) and n(2,1) with integral
coecients as that representing ni in terms of n(1,2) and n(2,1). it is thus sucient to list
all possible graphs representing the matrix n(2,1), provided one checks that all ni have non-

negative integral entries. in contrast with the case of bsl(2), no complete solution is known
for bsl(3). the current state of the art is presented in appendix d with tables, gures and

relevant comments.

3.2 graph fusion algebras

to see what is playing the role of the fusion algebra in the argument of cardy, we have
to introduce the graph fusion algebra. the graph fusion algebra, as rst discussed by
pasquier [48], is a fusion-like algebra attached to a connected graph g. let j
a be the
common orthonormal eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices g labelled by j  exp(g). in
general, these eigenvectors can be complex. in the case of degenerate eigenvalues the associ-
ated eigenvectors need to be suitably chosen. we assume that the graph has a distinguished
node labelled 1 = 1 such that j
one then denes the numbers

1 > 0, for all j  exp(g).

(3.2)

and the matrices na with elements ( na)b
a = na.
because of orthonormality, n1 = i. since each matrix na has a single non-vanishing entry in

which is an associative and commutative algebra. of course, if the graph g is of type a,
this boils down to the ordinary verlinde fusion algebra since the matrix  of eigenvectors is
nothing but the modular matrix s.

alternatively (3.4) may be used as a starting point to reconstruct the graph algebra, as
explained in section 3.5.

it should be stressed that the denition of a graph fusion algebra is not unique.

in
general, it depends on the choice of the distinguished node 1 and, when there are degenerate
eigenvalues, also on the choice of the eigenvectors j
a. to view the graph fusion algebra as a
proper fusion algebra we would like the structure constants nab
c to be non-negative integers.
but even the rationality of these numbers is not obvious and it is therefore surprising that,
for appropriate choices of the s and of node 1 and for most cases, they turn out to be

integers of either sign. among all the examples known to us in bsl(n) theories, 2  n  5,
it fails in only two cases: the graph called e (12)
in figure 11, for which there is no node 1
satisfying 1 = 1, and whose n algebra involves fractions of denominator 4; and a graph
occuring in the bsl(4)4 theory, already mentioned in [51] and studied extensively in [53, 54],

finally the non-negativity of the n is only possible for certain graphs which we call
proper fusion graphs. for example, for the s(2) theories, the a-d-e graphs that admit a
proper graph fusion algebra are

in which half-integer nab

c of either sign occur.

5

proper a-d-e graphs = an, d2q, e6, e8 .

(3.6)

the choice of distinguished node for the s(2) a-d-e graphs is explained in appendix b.

we note that the set of proper s(2) fusion graphs matches the modular invariant parti-
tion functions listed as type i at the end of section 1. the situation is somewhat dierent
for s(3) graphs, for which we have to introduce a further distinction. in this case, some
graphs with non-negative ns are not associated with type i theories. we reserve the termi-
nology type i graph for those graphs associated with type i theories (see appendix d and

tables). moreover, as is clear from the bsl(4)4 example above, some type i modular invariant

partition functions are associated with graphs with non-integer and/or non-positive nab
c. in
the following, we discard these exceptional cases and restrict ourselves to type i graphs that
are associated with type i rcfts. in general, the question of precisely which graphs admit
type i fusion algebras should be related to the classication of type i rcfts, and thus is a
very interesting open question.

3.3 fusion rules and block characters

given a solution to the cardy equation, that is a set of partition functions

za|b(q) =xii

nia

b i(q)

(3.7)

and the corresponding graphs, we assume as in section 3.2 above that there exists a special
node called 1. we then introduce the combinations of characters (or block characters)

where

c(q) =xii

nic i(q)

nic = ni1

c

is referred to as the basic intertwiner. thanks to (3.5), (3.7) may be rewritten as

za|b(q) =xc

nca

b c(q)

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

where the coecients are now given by the structure constants of the graph fusion algebra
of g.

equation (3.10) is a mathematical identity and as such is valid and consistent indepen-
dent of the choice of the distinguished node and eigenvectors of g. physically, however, the
case where the nab
c are non-negative integers is the most interesting. in that case, following
cardys discussion [10], it is suggested that nab
c gives the number of times that the propa-
gating mode or representation c appears in the strip or cylinder with boundary conditions
a and b. thus if g is a type i graph, i.e. if the structure constants nab
c are non-negative
integers, we have a possible interpretation: the nodes a of the graph(s) g under considera-
tion label a class of representations of some extended chiral algebra. the blocks a are their
characters, and the integer coecients nab

c are their fusion coecients.

to probe this interpretation, let us see how it confronts the results in the bulk, in
particular how it is consistent with the form of the torus partition function. there, it has
been observed already long ago that (for type i theories) the torus partition function (cf
(1.5)) may be recast in the form

ztorus = xat | a|2 ,

(3.11)

i.e. as a diagonal sum over a subset t of block characters. the subset t corresponds to a
subalgebra of the n algebra, in the sense that if a, b  t , nab
c 6= 0 only if c  t . this
result that was rst observed empirically [49] was subsequently derived in a variety of cases
of type i s(n) theories based either on conformal embeddings or on orbifolding [51, 52].
more recently, it was taken as a starting point for an investigation of the algebraic structure
underlying these theories [53, 54].

21

the following interpretation is thus suggested. the nodes a  t label representations
of the maximally extended algebra a of the rcft (of type i) under consideration. the
subalgebra of the n algebra is the conventional fusion algebra of this rcft. the other nodes
a 6 t might label other twisted representations. the entire n algebra would describe the
fusion of all, twisted and untwisted, representations of a. this interpretation in terms
of twisted representations seems corroborated by the fact that some a are known also to
occur in partition functions on a torus in the presence of twisted boundary conditions. the
fact that general boundary conditions on a cylinder also appeal to these representations was
rst observed in the potts model in [21]. see for some work in this direction [55], and the
more systematic developments [28] on orbifold theories along the lines of [60]. the concept of
twisted representations in other cases, like conformal embeddings, remains to be understood.

having discussed the situation for type i theories and graphs, we return to rcfts of type
ii. there the situation is more elusive. on the one hand, as discussed above, the boundary
conditions on a cylinder are labelled by nodes of an improper graph g, and although we can
still write an expression of the form (3.10), its physical interpretation is unclear. on the
other hand, from (1.6), we know [71] that the torus partition function may be expressed in
terms of block characters pertaining to a parent type i theory with graph g

ztorus = xat

a(q)(cid:16) (a)(q)(cid:17) ,

(3.12)

where t is once again a subset of the nodes of g corresponding to a subalgebra of the n
algebra, and  is an automorphism of that subalgebra n(a)(b)

(c) = nab

c.

related in that way to the d10 theory. their respective torus partition function read

for example, the bsl(2)16 theory labelled by the dynkin diagram e7 is known to be
z (d10)

it seems that the parent graph g also plays a role for cylinder partition functions of
type ii theories. indeed, to obtain cylinder partition functions expanded with non-negative
coecients in terms of block characters, we just have to expand in the block characters of
g. specically, we nd

this formula applies for g = e7 and g = d10. in this case there is an ambiguity as to which
d10 eigenvector is taken for m = 9 but in fact one can take either. the matrices are changed
by the z2 symmetry but the cylinder partition functions agree. we also expect this formula
to hold for the type ii sl(3) theories.

i.e.
the partition function may be obtained as the sum over a special set of boundary
conditions of cylinder partition functions. this expression is of course deeply rooted in all
the connections between bulk and boundary theories, open and closed strings, etc, but still
we nd its simplicity intriguing.

3.4 examples

more examples can be given to the previous general scheme.

well posed problem on which we have only partial results.

in particular, classes of

 bsl(n) : the classication of the representations of the fusion algebra of bsl(n)k is a
graphs pertaining to bsl(3) as well as some cases for higher n have been expounded

from various standpoints in [37, 49, 50, 51, 52, 56], (see appendix d). in all known
cases, the previous discussion may be repeated: intertwiners, type i graphs, and other
concepts introduced above, still apply. we refer the reader to the above references.

23

 the case of bsl(n)1 may be described in detail. the representations of bsl(n)1 are
labelled by an integer 0  i  n  1 (we depart here from our previous convention,
with i = 0 denoting the identity). the fusion rules are isomorphic to the addition of
integers modulo n, and the algebra dened by ninj = ni+j mod n is thus generated by
n1, nj = (n1)j. the eigenvalues of nj are exp 2ij/n. the regular representation
j = j,i+1 mod n . all the previous
is provided by n  n matrices, generated by (n1)i
eigenvalues are reached once and we may thus say that the system has exponents
 = 0,   , n  1 (mod n). in general, a representation {ni} of the fusion algebra is
associated with each divisor q of n = p.q, including q = 1 and q = n: q denotes the
b = ba,1 mod q, for a
order of the matrix n1 which is qq dimensional and such that (n1)a
labelling of the nodes a, b = 1,   , q. (this exhausts all integer-valued representations
of the algebra. indeed the conditions that nt
1 = nn1 and n1nn1 = i imply that
the only entries of n1 are 0 and 1, and that n1 is a permutation matrix. being of
order q and indecomposable, n1 is a matrix of a cycle of length q. q.e.d.) obviously
the matrices ni = (n1)i are all integer-valued, n0 = i, and nt
i = ni = nni. the
graph of adjacency matrix n1 is an oriented q-gon. in that case, we may say that the
q exponents are 0, p,   , p(q  1).
this census of representations of the bsl(n)1 fusion algebra matches almost perfectly

that of modular invariant partition functions carried out by itzykson [57] and degio-
vanni [58]. we recall that according to these authors, a dierent modular invariant is
associated with each divisor of n, where n = n if n is odd and n = n/2 if it is even.
thus, only the case n even, q = 1 has to be discarded in our list of representations of
the fusion algebra, as it does not correspond to a modular invariant.

3.5 algorithmic approaches to graph algebras

in section 3.2, we have introduced the matrices n by (3.2) and derived (3.4). instead of
looking at the graph as a collection of points we can look at it as a collection of matrices n,
providing a basis of a commutative associative algebra, and an action of the intertwiners ni
given by (3.4), that is, we take (3.4) as a starting point. given the graph g, in particular
c, it is possible in many cases to invert (3.5) and solve for na as linear
the coecients ni1
combinations with integral coecients of the intertwiners ni, or equivalently, as polynomials
of the fundamental adjacency matrices. similarly the relation (3.4) written in terms of the
eigenvalues j(i) = sji

j(i) a(i) =xb

nja

b b(i) ,

i  e , j  i ,

(3.18)

is a recursive relation determining (the rows of) the eigenvector matrix i
a.
in general,
typically in the presence of degenerate eigenvalues, the matrix i
a is not determined uniquely,
or alternatively, (3.5) cannot be inverted for all a  v. for the type i cases, however, as
explained above, there exists an extended fusion algebra isomorphic to a subalgebra of the

24

bi , or alternatively express j

graph algebra, so that the extended fusion matrices n ext
bi can be identied with a subset
na with the nodes a  t  v [49]. in most of these type i cases one can solve for all na
in terms of the nis and n ext
a in terms of the modular matrices
sij , sext
bsbl. a particularly simple subclass of type i for which one can go quite far in the
programme of reconstructing the graph g and all the related structures is presented by the
orbifold theories, in particular the ones associated with groups generated by simple currents.
in our approach they can be described by graphs obtained by orbifolding the fundamental
graphs of the initial diagonal theory, the simplest example being provided by the wzw sl(2)
d2l series obtained by orbifolding the dynkin diagram a4l3 over the z2 group generated
by the automorphism . in these cases as well as in their sl(n) generalisations dened in
[59] involving the group zn , one can algorithmically construct the eigenvector matrix, see
appendix b for an illustration in the simplest n = 2 case. in a dierent approach, based on
the original orbifold treatment of [60], an elegant general formula for the eigenvector matrix
was derived recently in [28]. it should be noted that the same graph (orbi)folding procedure
leads also to type ii graphs, e.g., the sl(2) dodd series, or their sl(3) generalisations for k 6= 0
mod 3, see appendix d.

we have assumed up to now in this discussion that the graphs are already known. on
the other hand the relations (3.4), (2.22) can be taken as the starting point for nding new
graphs, typically exceptional graphs not covered by the previous algorithmic orbifold con-
structions. since any graph in the vicinity of the identity resembles the original diagonal
(a) graph, one can rst try to identify nis for which the r.h.s. of (3.5) reduces to one term,
a = aai and hence one can identify ni = nai. according to (3.18) this also determines
i.e., ni1
ai by i(j) once j
j
1 is known. this is a problem which is reduced to the computation of
some verlinde fusion multiplicities. indeed let us take the rst matrix element a = b = 1 of
the matrix relation (2.22) we have

1 times. let us assume rst
where in the last sum  = {  i|n1
a are
that in (3.19) i = j. whenever the r.h.s. of (3.19) is equal to 1, since by denition ni1
a = aai. furthermore
integers, the l.h.s. summation reduces to one term, i.e., we recover ni1
ai as being given by the
plugging this into the l.h.s. of (3.19) taken for j 6= i we recover nj1
sum of verlinde fusion multiplicities in the r.h.s. of (3.19), i.e., we determine the multiplicity
with which nai appears in nj, see (3.5). similarly, a value 2 or 3 for the r.h.s. of (3.19) with
i = j would lead to 2, respectively 3 terms in (3.5), while 4 could be interpreted either as
a = 2aai.
leading to 4 terms with multiplicity one, or 1 term with multiplicity two, i.e., ni1
what we only need in order to check all these possibilities is to know the content of the set
1. this data is provided in type i theories for all of which  encodes the content
, i.e., ni1
a = multba(i),
of the identity representation of the extended algebra. more generally, ni1
identifying a with a representation ba of the extended algebra. the relation (3.19) and its
consequences just described are the rst steps in a consistent algorithmic procedure proposed

25

by xu [53] (see also [54] for further developments) in the abstract framework of subfactors
theory, which also reproduces previous results in [37, 49, 51, 52]. in particular, the subset of
ni which can be identied with some nai are related to irreducible sectors in [53, 54], with
the sum in the l.h.s. of (3.19) interpreted as a scalar product (i, j). the algorithm reduces
systematically the determination of ni , na in type i cases to data provided by the verlinde
fusion matrices n and n ext. all graphs previously found in [37, 49, 51] were recovered by

this method and furthermore a new bsl(4)6 example was found in [52].

finally let us point out that to some extent this algorithm for nding new solutions of
the equations (3.4) and (2.22), i.e., new graphs, can be applied to type ii cases where we
1, i.e., the set . one can start with some trial set and compute
do not know a priori ni1
p((j,)
1)2 = 1. then one
can proceed as in type i. for example the e7 dynkin diagram may be reconstructed using
 = {1, 9, 17}. dierent (consistent) choices of the set  might lead to the same graph,
reecting the possibility of dierent choices of the identity node.

)2 = s1jp sj. a rst consistency check is that pje(j

1

in some simple cases it is possible to recover a complete set of boundary conditions by
applying formula (3.4) to a known subset in such a way that only one term appears in the
sum in the r.h.s. in terms of the equivalent formula (3.18) for the eigenvalues we obtain a
new solution i
a with the verlinde eigenvalue j(i).
this seems to be the idea of the so called aeck fusion conjecture [16], which clearly has
a restricted application, with the general formulae (3.4), (3.18) being the correct substitute
for it.

b , b = b(a, j) , by fusing a given one i

another approach to constructing type i graphs was discussed in [51] and used to nd
new solutions for higher rank cases. it is based on the use of a relation for the structure
constants of the pasquier algebra, the dual of the graph algebra, with structure constants
labelled by elements in the set exp(g) and given by a formula analogous to (3.2), however
with the summation running over the nodes of the graph; this algebra will be discussed
further in section 4.4.1 below.

4 . bulk and boundary operator algebras

in this section we investigate the consequences of locality in the presence of boundaries. our
discussion parallels that of cardy and lewellen [11], but generalises it in two respects: to
higher rank and to non-diagonal theories. this results in additional multiplicities associated
with the more general representations of the verlinde algebra (2.22). our presentation makes
use of concepts used by moore and seiberg for bulk rcfts and extends them appropriately
for this new setting. this leads to a richer structure in the equations and the appearance
of a triplet of algebras (ni, na, mj). separately these algebras have appeared before but the
inter-relation between these algebras has not been shown in this context.

26

4.1 ground state degeneracies

as stressed by aeck and ludwig [15], the logarithm of the partition function, in the limit
l/t  , contains not only the universal term proportional to l and to the central charge
(in unitary theories), but also an l independent term, interpreted as a boundary condition
dependent ground state degeneracy ln gagb. indeed in that limit

the identity operator. we therefore identify

ga =

.

(4.2)

thus in unitary minimal models, using (2.38) and (2.28), we have the following expres-

sion for the boundary states

limit [11], [24], [25]; we shall normalise them similarly so that only a dependence on ga is
retained, i.e., h1ia will coincide with the 1-point function of the identity operator in this
limit.

4.2 bulk and boundary elds, ope

4.2.1 boundary elds

according to cardy [10], boundary conditions can be interpreted as created by the insertion
of elds ba
j,(x) living on the boundary, im z = 0, x =re z of the upper half-plane z  h+
b of such elds, to be called
here j  i , a, b  v , and  accounts for the multiplicity nja
j a(cid:17) . thus  can be interpreted as a coupling index  = 1, 2 . . . , nja
of type (cid:16) b
b and the
boundary elds as kind of chiral vertex operators (cvo) associated with a second type
j a(cid:17)
of couplings (cid:16) b
, a, b  v , j  i. this is a formal analogy since the boundary states
|ai,|bi labelled by a, b are superpositions of ishibashi states. the multiplicity index  is
traditionally omitted, but it should be stressed that even in the sl(2) case, in all but the
b > 1, so most of
diagonal cases (e = i), there are always some non-trivial multiplicities nja
b = ab the index associated with the coupling
the time we shall retain this index. since n1a
(cid:16) b
1 b(cid:17) takes only one value and will be denoted  = 1b, or just 1, or, altogether omitted.
on the other hand in all non-diagonal cases there is a non-trivial subset {11
j , j  } of
boundary elds, with 1    i , where the set  has been introduced in section 3.5.

to make contact with section 2.2, consider the nite strip w = l

 log z equipped with

4.2.2 bulk elds and bulk-boundary coecients

we turn to the second ingredient of the cardy-lewellen boundary cft, the bulk elds. the
half-plane bulk elds i (z, z) , z = x + iy  h+ , z = x iy transform under a representation
of l(h) [34] realised by dierential operators

lh
n = ln(i , z) + ln(i , z)

(4.22)

and characterised by a pair i = (i,i) of weights. in cases when there is more than one eld
with the same labels (i,i) a more involved notation like i = (i,i; ) is needed, but usually
omitted for simplicity. for type i theories as well as for arbitrary scalar elds both i,i  e,
while in general i,i  i.
1,0 determines the 1point
function of (i,i)(z , z) as well as the 2point function haa

the invariance with respect to the subalgebra spanned by l(h)

p, (i,i)i , e.g.,

h0|aa
=

p,(x1) (i,i) (z, z)|0i

(z  z)i+ip (x1  z)i+pi (x1  z)i+pi

32

(4.23)

,

x1 > re z .

requiring the symmetry of this function under the exchange of the two elds leads to the
constraint ii  z. similarly admitting as well anticommuting elds would lead to half-
integer spins; for simplicity we shall restrict ourselves in this paper to integer spin elds.

the r.h.s. of (4.23) is the 3-point block of the standard cvo h0|p ,1

p(x1) i ,t(z) i ,1i(z)|0i ,
p. consistently with this the (primary)

bulk eld can be represented via the decomposition

ii(cid:17) , t = 1, 2, . . . , nii

(i,i)(z , z)

with t a coupling index of type(cid:16) p

4.3 boundary cft duality relations

4.3.1 cardy-lewellen equations rederived

we collect in this section the set of equations resulting from the sewing constraints of the
boundary cft; some of these equations can be interpreted as expressing locality (symmetry)
of the boundary correlators. for simplicity of notation some of these equations will be written

down without explicitly indicating the coupling indices of type (cid:16) i
j k(cid:17) and the corresponding
summations, i.e., essentially for the simplest sl(2) case. however we shall keep the charge
conjugation in the indices of i so that the general formulae can be easily recovered. in the
sl(2) wzw case the braiding phases are given by the shifted scaling dimensions sug
j  j,
instead of sug
(since the pair of coordinate and isospin variables is moved as a whole). then
formulae work equally well with the same fusing and braiding matrices, without additional
signs, as for the corresponding subfamily (1, 2j + 1) of elds in virasoro minimal models.

j

applying (4.11) in dierent ways to the 4point function of boundary elds , that is
demanding associativity, leads to a relation connecting the two types of fusing matrices (1)f
and f , the fusing matrix for the ordinary cvo, which reads symbolically

(1)f (1)f f = (1)f (1)f

the identity (4.30), when restricted to the s(2) case, is a slightly simplied version of the
equation (l 3.29) in [12] and can be obtained from the latter using the relation (4.16) and

34

dropping a (non-zero) factor of type (1)fa1. the derivation of this pentagon-like identity
depicted in figure 8 is analogous to the derivation of the standard pentagon equation for
the fusing matrices f since the boundary eld n-point blocks are analogs of the ordinary
(n + 2)-point conformal blocks with an additional constraint due to the delta function in the
2-point boundary block. the relation resulting from (4.20), with both sides divided by h1ic
and (4.19) used twice, is also reproduced from the pentagon identity (4.30) for particular
values of the indices.

the equation (4.32), written symbolically bb (1)f f = db, is analogous to the equation
resulting from locality of the full-plane 4-point physical functions, which reads ddf f = dd. it
is however linear in the ope coecients d since while for the plane bulk eld the coecients d

in the decomposition into cvo  =p d    are the same as those in ope expansion, here the

for i = 1 (4.34) reduces to (4.32) using a standard symmetry of the surviving fusing matrix
f . the sum over s in the r.h.s. of (4.34) represents up to phases one of the sides in (an
auxiliary) hexagon identity, resulting in permuting {l , i , k} to {k , i , l} i.e., can be written
as b23()b12()b23() and thus can be replaced by b12()b23()b12(). this gives an
alternative representation of the r.h.s. of (4.34) obtained from the above by replacing ev-
erywhere (k , k , j , r)  (l , l , j , t). this is the original form of the equation (l 3.35) in
[12] with furthermore inverse operator ordering convention and opposite overall sign of the
phase.

the locality of this 3-point function (the symmetry under the exchange of the elds )

implies also

(k,k)(l,l) = (1)sk+slsj d(j,j);23(t),23(t)
d(j,j);t,t

(l,l)(k,k)

,

sk := k  k ,

(4.35)

while from the associativity of the ope (4.28) one obtains in particular the relation

d(j,j);t,t

(k,k)(l,l) d(1,1)

(j,j)(j,j) = d(k,k);13(t),13(t)

(4.36)
all the above equations hold true as well with a sign  = 1, inserted in the expo-
nents of all the phases in these equations including (4.25), and replacing the bulk-boundary
coecients b with b. thus when rewritten in terms of the cardy-lewellen normalised
coecients b(cl) all equalities are true for both choices of sign.

the lewellen equations in the diagonal sl(2) case were recently conrmed in [67]. the seem-
ingly dierent version of equation (4.31) in [13] is in fact equivalent to the original lewellen equation,
after taking into account one of the duality relations (a hexagon identity, see (e.6) in appendix e)
for the braiding matrices. on the other hand the derivation of the versions of (4.32), (4.34) in [13]
appears to be aected by a missing phase in the intermediate (and needless) formula (17) in [13].
this phase is compensated in the nal formulae following from (4.32) (like (4.47) below) by an-
other phase due to the presumably neglected dierence in the normalisation of the bulk-boundary
coecients (like in (4.25)) as compared with that in [11, 12].

comment: such mixed pentagon identities appear in [62] in the study of weak hopf algebras
as part of a big pentagon identity. at rst sight the structure in [62] seems dierent. the third
matrix f2 (called an ocneanu cell), introduced along with the analogs of f and (1)f and their
inverses, does not seem to t the quantity with the same name studied in lattice models which
satises rather a hexagon-like yang-baxter identity. furthermore, if we try to add dual couplings

of type (cid:16) c

b a(cid:17) and (cid:16) j

a i(cid:17), then the rst has sense at least for type i non-diagonal cases, but the

second cannot be interpreted as a multiplicity.

note that using the inverse matrix (3)f , as introduced here, the half-plane bulk eld

can be also written as a product of generalised boundary elds

4.4 consequences of the bulk-boundary equations

4.4.1 the pasquier algebra and its dual

in this section we analyse some important consequences of the set of equations derived. we
start with equation (4.44), an inverted version of the rst lewellen bulk-boundary equation
(4.31), in which we take s = 1 = p. this implies k = j ,i = i,  = 1a,  = 1b,  = . the
sum over m in the l.h.s. is proportional to the modular matrix sji, see (e.9), while the sums
over the coupling indices 2 ,  are worked out using (4.42), the nal result being

sji
s1i

ab1

i h1ia =xb

nja

b bb1

i h1ib .

(4.45)

for simplicity we have done this computation in the sl(2) case but it extends straightfor-
wardly to arbitrary rank leading to the same formula.

comparing (4.45) with (3.18), we see that it can be identied with the realisation (3.18)
of the graph algebra matrices na.
i h1ia with the ratio b(i)/a(i). recalling the
a and

of the relation (3.4) in terms of the eigenvalues a(i) = i

namely we can identify the ratio bb1
expression for h1ia in (4.6) we nd a relation between the boundary state coecients i

(4.46)

where for the time being cii is an arbitrary constant, c11 = 1. conversely, if we assume the
identication (4.46) (as, e.g., derived in the sl(2) case by other means in [11], with cii = 1,
see also [24, 25]) we recover the relation (3.18), or, (3.4) directly from the bulk-boundary
equations. as discussed in section 3.6, from this relation we reconstruct the graph algebra.
a = saj, the relation (3.18) coincides with the
verlinde formula, i.e., the standard fusion algebra realised by its characters. on the other

in the diagonal case e = i, where j

40

hand the verlinde formula is known [13] to be recovered from the diagonal version of the
other bulk-boundary equation, the cardy-lewellen equation (4.32) to which we now turn.
this equation simplies for r = 1, leading to k = k , l = l. using (4.46) and denoting
pi(a) = i

a the equation (4.32) turns into

let us rst look at the diagonal case in which according to (4.49) the constants mkl
j. this is conrmed also directly
coincide with the verlinde fusion rule multiplicities nkl
by the alternative expression (4.48) provided by equation (4.32) as we shall now show. in
the diagonal case, denoting d(j,j);t,t
(k,k)(l,l), we can use the inverted equation (4.33)
1 = 1r, with the
taken for a = 1, a choice which trivialises all summations, since nr1

(4.50)

(4.51)

comparing with (4.46) taken in the diagonal case we see that we can identify the undeter-
mined constant cii with the normalisation constant of the bulk 2point function. we shall
retain this identication of cii in the non-diagonal cases (at the same level as the given diag-
onal case) which amounts to setting the relative 2-point normalisation to 1. combined with
(4.36) and (4.46) the relation (4.50) leads to a symmetry of the fusing matrices analogous
to the cyclic symmetry (4.19)

inserting (4.50) back into (4.48) and using (4.52) reduces the sum over t to the standard
pentagon identity specialised for some choice of the indices (cf. the analogous relation (4.41)).

41

finally we are left with the sum over the coupling index t = t(cid:16) j

j and completes the argument. note that the relation (4.50) is a
verlinde multiplicity nkl
linear version of the standard (quadratic) relation for the full plane diagonal ope coecients
which results from locality of the (full) plane bulk elds 4point functions, see appendix e.

in the general (non-diagonal) sl(2) cases characterised by a xed level (central charge)
we can express the fusing matrix in the r.h.s. of (4.48) in terms of that in the r.h.s. of (4.50).
using once again the sl(2) versions of the identities just described, we express it in terms of
the diagonal ope coecients at the same level, obtaining for nkl

j = 1

mkl

j = d(j,j)

(k,k)(l,l) = d(j,j)

(k,k)(l,l) /c (j,j)

(k,k)(l,l) .

(4.53)

the relative scalar ope coecients d(j,j)
(k,k)(l,l) have been computed for the sl(2) wzw and
the virasoro (unitary) minimal models, see, e.g., [50] for an exhaustive list of references.
now using the expression for eigenvectors (2.38), they can be computed as in (4.49) for all
minimal models.

between the constants mkl
with an sl(3) wzw example which illustrates the relation (4.48). there are three graphs
found in [37] which correspond to the exceptional block-diagonal modular invariant at level
k + 3 = 12, see appendix d, where these graphs are denoted by e (12)

pick up triplets of weights (i, j, l) such that the verlinde multiplicity of the diagonal sl(3)
l = 1 and check the values of the corresponding
model at level k + 3 = 12 is trivial, nij
l for each of the three graphs. the result is that,
pasquier algebra structure constants mij
comparing in particular e (12)

(i,i)(j,j), this result suggests

the formula (4.53) extends beyond the sl(2) case for (k, l, j) such that nkl

that there are two dierent solutions for the bulk ope coecients in this case. only one of
these two non-diagonal solutions, namely the one which can be associated with the type i
graph e (12)
1 was recovered in [51], exploiting a set of equations for the m -algebra structure
constants. this set was derived from the bulk cft locality equations assuming an additional
(quadratic) constraint on the ope coecients in theories with an extended symmetry; some
of its consequences were also reproduced in the abstract framework of [53], in particular the
a = multa(i) discussed in section 3.6. precisely this relation fails (and hence the
relation ni1
assumptions on the ope coecients in [51]) for the graph e (12)
, which otherwise satises all
the requirements of type i.

we conclude with a comment on the ope coecients. as discussed in [24, 25] one can
relate in the limit l/t   the correlators of the half- and full-plane bulk elds h
i (z, z)
i (, ), looking at the two dual representations of the partition function with eld
and p
insertions; in particular (4.46) was recovered in this way. though this transformation needs
to be elaborated for higher rank cases it seems reasonable to expect (and in agreement with
(4.50)) that using the two choices of the automorphism , discussed in section 2.1, we can
identify in this way the ope coecients of the two bulk elds with either i = i = (j, j)
or i = (j, j).

a bit of history: the algebra (4.47) dened through the eigenvectors of the a-d-e cartan
matrices rst appeared in the context of the sl(2) a-d-e lattice models proposed by pasquier
[48] a short time before the verlinde fusion rule formula (the a algebra in the sl(2) case) was
found. the interpretation in terms of a pair of dual c (character)algebras was proposed in
[49] in the discussion of the set of graphs found in [37] as a generalisation of the dynkin diagrams
associated with the modular invariants of sl(3) wzw and minimal models. the fact that the
relative scalar ope coecients d(j,j)
(k,k)(l,l) of all a-d-e series of the sl(2) wzw (or the subfamily of
elds (1, s) in unitary minimal models) coincide in a suitable basis with the pasquier algebra (4.47)
j was the main result of [50]. it was established through a case by case
structure constants mkl
check, supported by a lattice model derivation in which the same coecients appear considering
representations of the temperley-lieb algebra. cft locality constraints resulting in formulae
quite similar in spirit to (4.48) were furthermore exploited in [51], [52] as an ingredient in the
construction of generalised pasquier algebras and thus of new examples of graphs related to sl(n)
modular invariants, extending the results in [37], [49]. the authors of [50], [51], [52] were however
not aware of the parallel development of boundary cft, and in particular of [11], [12], where the
equation (4.32) rst appeared. the importance of the algebra obtained from this equation at r = 1
was recognised and stressed in [13], where a representative example of the sl(2) wzw dodd series
was considered, for which the set v and the characters i(a) of the algebra were explicitly described.
presumably the authors of [13] were not aware of the general a-d-e result in [50]. in the same
framework of boundary cft the pasquier algebra reappeared recently in a systematic study of
orbifold theories, see [28] and references therein, under the name (total) classifying algebra.

4.4.2 relation to the moore-seiberg set of duality equations

we have seen that the two lewellen bulk-boundary equations (4.31) and (4.32) when re-
stricted to some particular values of the indices p in bbp
(i,i) become in some sense dual
to each other, recovering the two dual c-algebras, the graph and pasquier algebras. these
algebras are identical in the diagonal case, reproducing the verlinde fusion algebra, which
suggests that in this case the above two equations might be related.

ij (p)) for the 1-point functions (p)

on the other hand let us recall that the original derivation [68, 32] of the verlinde
formula relies on the use of one of the basic moore-seiberg duality relations, namely the
equation resulting from the modular property of the two-point functions on the torus, see
(e.7). it involves the fusing/braiding matrices f or b and the modular matrix sij(p) (in
general st t
j (, z) on the torus, the index p standing for the
, log z = (log z)/ , see [32].
the alert reader may have already noticed the full analogy between the moore-seiberg
torus identity (e.7) and the second version (4.44) of equation (4.31). it suggests that the
quantity taking over the role of the modular matrix s(p) is the bulk-boundary reection
coecient bp. in the diagonal case this correspondence is precise, i.e., the two are identical
up to a constant.

indeed rst note that equation (4.44), still considered in the general (non-diagonal) case,
simplies for s = 1, that is k = j ,i = i,  = 1a. inserting in the rst line the expression
for the modular matrix sij(p), see (e.8) and using (4.41) in the second line we obtain an
expression for the modular matrix s(p),

let us concentrate now on the diagonal case i = e. the sums in the r.h.s. of (4.54)
b = jb,  = 1b.
can be reduced to one term choosing a = 1 and using (4.12), since nj1
alternatively, one can take a = 1 directly in the original equation (4.31)  the resulting
(linear) formula for bp in terms of the fusing matrices f (instead of the formula for its
square derived in [11]) was rst explicitly written down by runkel [67]. more explicitly we
have in the sl(2) case,

both (4.54) and (4.55) easily extend beyond the sl(2) case. in particular restoring all coupling

with the help of one of the consequences of the pentagon identity, (4.56) can be inverted
and brought into a form analogous to that of (4.55).

the coincidence of the two seemingly very dierent quantities, the coecients bp in
the expansion (4.24) of the half-plane bulk eld and the modular matrix s(p) of the torus
1point blocks, is quite surprising and needs a better understanding. we were led to this
observation trying to nd a connection between the two duality schemes, the one of moore-
seiberg involving the torus, the other, of cardy-lewellen, involving the cylinder. thus to
bring equation (4.44), derived from the rst of the lewellen bulk-boundary equations (4.31),
into a form identical to the original moore-seiberg torus duality relation we furthermore
need to identify the three fusing matrices,

(1)f = f = (3)f .

(4.57)
this identication is consistent since in the diagonal case i = e both mixed pentagon iden-
tities (4.30) and (4.40) then become the ordinary moore-seiberg pentagon identity; see also
[67], where the identication of the boundary eld ope coecients with the fusing matrices
was rst established by a more elaborate argument. note also that all the other symmetries
of (1)f we have encountered, such as (4.21), (4.43), are symmetries of the standard fusing
matrices.

it is now straightforward to show that the rst and third lines in (4.44) reproduce the
two sides of the moore-seiberg identity (e.7). taking into account (4.55) and (4.57) the
second lewellen bulk-boundary equation (4.32) is seen also to be a consequence of the rst,
i.e., of the same moore-seiberg torus duality relation. to show this, one has to insert in
(4.32) the expression (4.50) for the ope coecients and to compare the equation with (4.44)
with p = 1, see also appendix e.

we thus see that in the diagonal case the two basic bulk-boundary equations (4.31),
(4.32) are not independent and are equivalent to one of the basic moore-seiberg duality
relations. the third bulk-boundary equation (4.34), a more general version of (4.32), is an
identity which involves again only the moore-seiberg duality matrices f , b , s, and thus can
be expected, following the completeness argument of [32], to be derivable using the basic
moore-seiberg duality relations. this in particular implies that any solution of the set of
moore-seiberg (chiral) duality relations provides a solution of the diagonal boundary cft
equations.

remark: rewritten in terms of s(p) the diagonal case lewellen equation (4.32), see also (e.10),
can be also interpreted as a generalised verlinde fusion formula with (non-integral) multiplicities
f l
qk given by some particular f matrix elements, see appendix e. the matrices fq are diago-
nalised by the (non-unitary) s(p) with the usual eigenvalues sqi(1)/s1i(1). because of this they
realise another representation of the usual verlinde algebra. this formula, which derives from the
moore-seiberg torus duality identity, appears to have been already considered, following a dierent
motivation, in [69].

we conclude this section with a few comments on the general non-diagonal cases. the
cardy-lewellen boundary cft can be looked at as a purely chiral alternative of the usual

45

cft approach in which we combine left and right chiral blocks imposing consistency condi-
tions. it has its price in that everything eectively splits the set i is replaced by two
dual sets v and e (for type i, while for type ii we have to retain the whole i to describe
non-scalar elds), there are two representations of the verlinde fusion algebra and a related
new fusion algebra (at least in type i cases); there are two types of chiral vertex operators,
new duality matrices, in particular a second fusing matrix (1)f and its inverse, (3)f, along
with the standard f , satisfying new duality relations, the mixed pentagon relations, gener-
alising one of the basic genus zero polynomial identities; instead of one relation involving the
modular matrix s(p), there are two independent relations  the two bulk-boundary equa-
tions involving the general reection coecients bp. it remains to nd a consistent solution
of the equations at least in the sl(2) case. some of the ingredients are already known and
have been recalled above. in particular the solution for the d-series has just been obtained
by runkel [80].

5 . conclusions and outlook

in this paper we have reexamined various aspects of boundary eects in rcfts. we have in
particular analyzed the consistency conditions that determine the allowed boundary states
and elds and their characteristic data, ope coecients, etc. we have seen that boundary
conditions are naturally associated with a graph, or a collection of graphs, whose spectral
properties (eigenvalues) encode the diagonal spectrum of the bulk theory. this legitimates
empirical observations made previously on the role of graphs in the classication of rcfts.
we have seen that the torus partition function may be fully reconstructed from the infor-

mation contained in these graphs. we have seen also that in several cases (bsl(2), bsl(n)1

theories), this approach provides a substantially simpler route to the classication of rcfts
than the study of bulk properties (modular invariants. . . ). we have nally seen that further
important information about some boundary eects (g-factors, boundary structure con-
stants) is also encoded in the spectral properties (eigenvectors) of these graphs. the bottom
line of this analysis is that a triplet of matrix algebras (nj, na, mi) plays a central role in
the whole discussion. these algebraic structures have been also conrmed by the detailed
analysis of the basic equations of the boundary eld theory. in the diagonal case the triplet
of algebras reduces to one, the verlinde fusion algebra. accordingly, we have seen that in
this case the basic boundary cft lewellen equations can be essentially identied with a set
of genus 0 and 1 duality identities of moore-seiberg. this leads to an identication of some
of the basic notions in the two approaches.

the more general representations ni of the verlinde fusion algebra and the dual pair
{ n , m} of associative, commutative (semisimple) algebras have been introduced in earlier
work on bulk (and later on boundary) conformal eld theories, but it seems to us that
the consistency of the whole scheme now appears in its full generality and that boundary
rcfts reveal these features in a simpler and more compelling way than in the bulk. in a

46

loose sense, the boundary eects expose better the underlying chiral structure of the theory
and its algebraic pattern. this should certainly not come as a surprise, as this is in the same
spirit as the old connection between open and closed strings.

the study of a rcft through its boundary conditions, its algebra triplet, etc, still
requires a lot of work. the derivation of the cardy equation relies on a technical assumption
that has been only partially justied, namely the proper denition of unspecialized characters
with linear independence and good modular properties for general chiral algebras. also it
would be good to have a better understanding of the completeness assumption: given a
certain number of boundary conditions satisfying the cardy equation, is it obvious that
we may always supplement them into a complete set in the sense discussed in section 2?
then many questions have been only partially treated: justify in full generality the validity
of expressions (3.11, 3.12) which have been established so far only for particular cases;
understand better the nature and fusion rules of twisted block representations that appear
in this discussion; set up a general scheme for the systematic classication of integer valued
representations of fusion algebras; set up with more rigour the formalism of generalized chiral
vertex operators, their fusing matrices and the ensuing duality equations as a consistent chiral
approach, alternative to the moore-seiberg scheme, etc, such are some of the outstanding
problems that are awaiting a proper treatment.

also it remains to see how our discussion of boundary conditions must be generalized
in theories where there is no choice of a common diagonalising matrix leading to n algebra
with integer structure constants. it has been suggested in [53, 54] that one way out is to
drop the axiom of commutativity, replacing this algebra by a non-commutative structure.
in that respect, a better understanding of the relation of our work with other more abstract
approaches  ocneanu theory of subfactors, weak hopf algebras  would be most protable.
directions for future work also include the discussion of other cases: rational or irrational
theories at c = 1, c = 2, or n = 2 superconformal theories are particularly important
cases in view of their physical applications to condensed matter or to string theory. the
generalization to other types of twisted boundary conditions along the cycle of the cylinder,
as examined recently in [81], might constitute another useful approach. finally the parallel
discussion of these boundary conditions and algebraic structures in lattice models should be
extremely instructive and will be the object of a forthcoming publication.

appendix a: the cardy equation

in this appendix, we rederive the cardy equation (section 2.2) in the presence of sources,
which have the eect of introducing unspecialized characters in the partition function. we
restrict to a conformal eld theory with a current algebra. let {j } denote the generators
in the cartan subalgebra, and  be charges coupled to them. we consider the theory on
the cylinder l  t of section 2.2, call w = u + iv the local variable, 0  v  l, u periodic

47

of period t , and modify the energy-momentum tensor t (w) into

.

as an elementary calculation shows, the last term is dictated by the requirement that t 
satises the conventional ope of an energy momentum tensor. the central charge is not
aected by the additional terms.

one then computes the evolution operators in the two channels of section 2.2, see

figure 1. for the cylinder, mapped to the plane by  = e2iw/t , the hamiltonian reads

h cyl =

du(t (w) + t ( w)) =

note that the additional term in (a.1) and (a.2) has not contributed to the integral over
a closed cycle. taking into account the fact that on boundary states l(p)
and
j (p) 
0

, we nd that the rst expression of the partition function reads

0 = l(p)

in the other channel, the time evolution on the strip is described by the hamiltonian

where now the additional piece in (a.1) contributes the last term. since the theory with en-

(a.10)

together with the linear independence of the i(q, z) to conclude that (2.16) is indeed true
in full generality.

appendix b: a-d-e diagrams and intertwiners

in this appendix we establish notations on a-d-e dynkin diagrams and on the associated
intertwiners.

let g be a dynkin diagram of the a-d-e type with coxeter number g. it has n nodes
that may be coloured with two colours, i.e. its n  n adjacency matrix gab connects only
nodes of dierent colours. this matrix is symmetric and it may thus be diagonalized in an
orthonormal basis. we call this orthonormal basis m
a , it is labelled by the node a and the
exponent m (see figure 2 and table 1). hence

the s satisfy orthonormality conditions, namely

ga

bs

b = 2 cos

s, s  exp(g)

(b.1)

(b.2)

(b.3)

because of the 2-colourability of g, one may attach a z2 grading  to each node a. one
proves that if s is an exponent, so is (s) = g  s and the s may be chosen to satisfy

(s)
a = (1) (a)s
a .

(b.4)

the a, dodd and e6 diagrams, have
moreover all graphs having even exponents, v.i.z.
a z2 automorphism  acting on their nodes and preserving their adjacency matrix (i.e.
ga

(b), this is the natural z2 symmetry of these graphs) such that

b = g(a)

s
(a) = (1) (s)s
a .

(b.5)

finally, one may nd in the graph g a distinguished node labelled a = 1 such that m
1 > 0
for all m. this special node is typically an extremal node, i.e. the end of a branch for the
a-d-e graphs; this is generally the end of a long leg, but for the dodd graphs, for which we
must choose 1 as the end point of one of the two short legs.

we list hereafter the explicit expressions of eigenvectors of the various dynkin diagrams.

the d g

2 +1 series are the simplest examples of orbifold models. their fundamental graphs
can be obtained by folding the ag1 dynkin diagram so that the nodes ai = agi  d g
2 +1 , i =
1, 2, 3, . . . , g
21 are identied with the orbit {i} of i under the z2 automorphism , (i) = g
2 , on the graph, denoted n, n1
i, while the xed point i = g/2 is resolved into two points a g
in figure 2. this implies for the adjacency matrix elements gaiaj = ai j + ai (j) = aij , for

over recent years, these matrices have made repeated appearances in a variety of prob-

the following contexts:

appendix c: uniqueness of the boundary conditions of
minimal models

c.1. matrices with spectrum  < 2

we rst recall general results on symmetric matrices with non-negative integer entries and
with eigenvalues between 2 and 2.

it is a standard result that symmetric matrices with non-negative integer entries and
eigenvalues  ] 2, 2[ may be classied. a lemma of kronecker asserts that the eigenvalues
are of the form 2 cos pi
for integers pi and hi and for the largest one(s), p = 1. one may
hi
regard any such matrix as the adjacency matrix of a graph. irreducible matrices correspond
to connected graphs, and by an abuse of language one may call a matrix bicolourable if the
graph has that property. one proves [38] that any irreducible bicolourable symmetric matrix
with spectrum in ] 2, 2[ is the adjacency matrix of one of the simply laced dynkin diagrams
of type a-d-e.

if one relaxes the assumption of bicolourability, with any symmetric non-bicolourable
irreducible matrix g one may associate a bicolourable symmetric matrix with a block form

g =   0 g
g 0 !. the corresponding graph is irreducible and has a z2 symmetry that ex-
changes the two colours. any eigenvalue  of g gives rise to two eigenvalues  for g and
one thus concludes that g is of a-d-e type, and its irreducibility forces g = a2p. its z2
quotient g is what we call the tadpole graph tp = a2p/z2.

finally if one relaxes the assumption of irreducibility, one concludes that any matrix
(with non-negative entries and spectrum between 2 and 2) is the direct sum of a-d-e or
tadpole graphs

g = gi

gi of a-d-e or tadpole type

and this decomposition is unique, up to the permutation of factors. the uniqueness may
be easily proved by induction on the number of terms or on the dimension of the matrix:
given a matrix g, one rst identies its largest eigenvalue, of the form 1 = 2 cos 
. by
h1
the previous statement, there is an a-d-e or tadpole graph g1 with coxeter number h1
and exponents mi, such that all its eigenvalues 2 cos mj
appear in the spectrum of g. thus
h1
g = g1  g, and one may apply on g the induction hypothesis. if 1 has multiplicity 1,
this suces to establish the uniqueness of the decomposition (up to permutations), while the
case where 1 has non-trivial multiplicity is also easily dealt with. the uniqueness of this
decomposition implies a property used several times in the text, namely that the spectrum

54

(between 2 and 2) determines the form of the matrix up to a permutation of its rows and
columns.

c.2. representatives of n12 and n21

we now return to minimal models.
explicit form of n12 and n21
it is convenient to work in a basis dierent from that used in (2.38). in the basis r1 = 1,   , p,
r2 = r1,2p+1r2 = 0
a  g, the second term in (2.33) does not contribute to n12 since n2p r1
for 1  r1, r2  p. thus n12 = ip  v2 = ip  g, where ip is the p dimensional unit matrix

n12 = ip  g =

in terms of the tadpole tp adjacency matrix. all the other nrs are obtained as universal
polynomials of the two matrices n12 and n21.

uniqueness of the form of n12 and n21
conversely, suppose we only know that the representation nrs has a spectrum specied by
the set of exponents e. we want to prove that there exists a basis in which n12 and n21 take
the forms (c.1) and (c.3).

we rst make use of the property that the set exp(g) is stable modulo the coxeter
number g of g under multiplication by any integer coprime to g and is also stable under the

55

reection s  g  s. we then nd that the spectrum of n12 is made of p copies of exp(g).
as explained above in c.1, this implies that in some basis

n12 = ip  g .

(c.4)

for the other generator n21, one observes rst that the set of numbers that appear

2p+1o, r = 1, 3   , 2p  1, is simply the set n(1)g+12 cos r
2p+1o,
in (2.31), namely n2 cos gr
r = 1, 3,   , 2p  1, which is (1)g+1 times the spectrum of the tadpole tp. according to
(2.31), this has to be multiplied by (1)s, as s runs over the exponents of g. thus if g
is even (which is the general case except when g = a2) the spectrum of n21 is made of as
many copies of that of tp (resp. tp) as there are odd (resp. even) exponents in g. for
a2 which has as many even as odd exponents, the same conclusion is still correct! finally
one notices that these signs are just the eigenvalues of the  matrix, and one thus concludes
that

(c.5)
where the sign  means that it holds in some basis obtained from that of (c.4) by a simul-
taneous permutation of rows and columns. from this expression, one can see that

n21  tp   ,

n21 has no row or column with more than two 1s,
n21 has exactly n rows and columns with one 1,

(c.6)

(c.7)

properties invariant under permutations of rows and columns.

we also know that n21 must commute with n12. in a basis in which n12 takes the form
(c.4), n21 may thus be regarded as made of n  n blocks that commute with g. we shall
combine these facts about n21 as follows:

 a non-vanishing matrix x with elements in n which commutes with g cannot have
a row or a column of zeros. proof: let 1 be the perron-frobenius eigenvector of g,
gx = xg implies that x1 is an eigenvector of g with the same eigenvalue, hence
proportional to 1, x1 = c1, with c 6= 0 since the entries of both x and of 1
are non-negative. if x had a vanishing row, x1 would have a vanishing component,
which is impossible for the perron-frobenius eigenvector. if x has a vanishing column,
one repeats the argument with x t .

 any matrix x with elements in n which commutes with g and which appears in the
block decomposition of n21 cannot have more than one 1 per row or column. proof: if
a matrix x with more than one 1 in a row (respectively column) was a block of n21,
because of the property (c.6), all the other blocks on the left or the right (respectively
above or below) of x would have to have at least one vanishing row (respectively
column), which is impossible by (i) above, or to vanish altogether. in the latter case,

56

after a possible reshuing of rows and columns leaving (c.4) invariant, one would have

either n21 =

   0

x 0
0
...
0



or n21 =

0 x 0   
x t
0   
0
...

0
0
...



(c.8)

which would lead to a pair n12, n21 reducible in the same basis.

 it follows that the matrices that may appear as blocks in the decomposition of n21
must be matrices with one 1 on each row and column, i.e. permutation matrices
that commute with g. these permutation matrices are the symmetries of the dynkin
diagram, and thus are readily listed:

x =

i, 

= i, i, i = 1,   , 5
=

i, 

=

i

if g = an, d2q+1, e6
if g = d4
if g = d2q, q > 2
if g = e7, e8

(c.9)

(c.10)

(c.11)

(c.12)

here i denote the 5 non-trivial permutations of the nodes of the d4 diagrams, and
the matrix  exchanges the two end points of d2q, q > 2.

one then demands that the symmetric matrix n21 made of such blocks is irreducible
and satises (c.4)-(c.7). this implies that at most one non-vanishing block appears on the
diagonal. consistency with the form n21  tp   leaves as the only possibility

(c.13)

where x1, x2, . . . , xp1 are chosen among the symmetry matrices of g. a nal permutation
of rows and columns by a block diagonal matrix diag(y1, y2,   , yp1, i) brings n21 into
the form n21 = tp   while leaving the form (c.4) of n12 unchanged, provided yj =
yj+1x t
j , hence yj = jxp1xp2    xj. then both n12 and n21 have their canonical forms
(c.1),(c.3). q.e.d

remark

although it is not required for the present analysis, it may be interesting to look at the
commutant of matrices of a-d-e type.

for any g of a-d-e type, with the exception of deven, all eigenvalues are distinct. it
follows that any matrix x that commutes with g may be diagonalized in the same basis

57

as g and consequently be written as a polynomial of g, i.e. as a linear combination of
i, g, g2,   , gn1. in order to look at cases where entries of x are requested to take values
0 or 1 only, and with constraints on the number of 1s, it is advantageous to use rather the
basis of fused graph matrices: x is a linear combination of the linearly independent matrices
n1 = i, n2 = g,   , nn. the deven case is slightly more involved, since the matrices that
appear naturally are not independent.

the commutant of an a-d-e matrix is:
 a linear combination of the graph fusion matrices na for g = a, dodd, e6, e7, e8.
 a linear combination of the na and of two of the three matrices ab, a 6= b = 1, 3, 4,

that exchange two of the three extremal points of the d4 graph.

 a linear combination of the na and of the two matrices x =  n2q and y = n2q,

where the matrix  exchanges the two end points, for g = d2q, q > 2.

appendix d: dsl(3) modular invariants and graphs
the wzw dsl(3) theories may be discussed along the same lines as in sections 2 and 3. solu-
tions ni to the cardy equation are associated with graphs, with specic spectral properties:
their eigenvalues are given by ratios of elements of the modular s matrix labelled by weights
of the diagonal spectrum e of the bulk theory. conversely, spectral properties and the fact
the ns form a representation of the fusion algebra are not restrictive enough to yield the
list of possible bulk spectra, as occurred in dsl(2) (up to the unwanted tadpole graphs).

there are indeed many solutions, i.e. graphs and representations of the fusion algebra, that
must be discarded as not corresponding to a modular invariant partition function in the list
(table 2) of gannon [79]: see [37] for such extra solutions. we may summarise the salient
features of the analysis as follows, see also the accompanying tables 2 and 3 and figures 11
and 12.

 at least one graph (or rather one set of n matrices) has been identied for each bulk
theory, i.e. each modular invariant. but it is not known if this list of graphs and ns
is exhaustive.

 note that the hypothesis of 3-colourability of the graphs that looked natural on the
basis of the sl(2) case has to be abandonned if we want to cover all cases. this is
manifest on table 3 where it appears that in some cases (namely a(n), and d(n), n
not a multiple of 3, and e(8), the set e is not invariant under the automorphism  of
(c.1), as it should be if the graph was 3-colourable.

 there are a few pairs or even triplets of isospectral graphs, i.e. dierent sets of ns
that give distinct solutions of the cardy equation for a given bulk theory. these

58

graphs/representations should not only describe dierent sets of complete orthonormal
sets of boundary conditions for that bulk theory, but also presumably be associated
with dierent operator algebras and lattice realisations.

 in table 3, which summarises the state of the art, we have also indicated if the graph
is of type i or type ii, following the discussion of section 3. some hybrid cases are also
encountered, in which the m and n structure constants are both non-negative, but
the n algebra has no subalgebra isomorphic to some extended fusion algebra.

this equation coincides with the quadratic relation resulting from locality of the physical 4
ki c 1
point function in the diagonal case. hence the constants c i
pp
can be identied with the physical ope structure constants in this case. for the minimal
models these constants were computed in [66]; the matrices f (0) in the gauge (e.2) coincide
up to signs with a product of standard q 6j symbols [82].

recall the moore-seiberg torus duality identity resulting from a relation in the modular
group of the two puncture torus, namely, s(j1, j2) a = b s(j1, j2) where s(j1, j2) is the

64

modular matrix of two-point blocks, expressed in terms of f and s(p), and a, b are the
monodromy transformations moving one of the cvo around the a, b cycles, [32]
