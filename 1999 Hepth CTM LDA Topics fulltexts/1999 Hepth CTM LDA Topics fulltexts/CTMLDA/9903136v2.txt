abstract

in this paper we continue the study of the path-integral formulation of classical mechan-
ics and in particular we better clarify, with respect to previous papers, the geometrical
meaning of the variables entering this formulation. with respect to the rst paper
with the same title, we correct here the set of transformations for the auxiliary vari-

ables a. we prove that under this new set of transformations the hamiltonian fh,

appearing in our path-integral, is an exact scalar and the same for the lagrangian.
despite this dierent transformation, the variables a maintain the same operatorial
meaning as before but on a dierent functional space. cleared up this point we then
show that the space spanned by the whole set of variables (, c, , c) of our path-integral
is the cotangent bundle to the reversed-parity tangent bundle of the phase space m
of our system and it is indicated as t (t m). in case the reader feel uneasy with
this strange grassmannian double bundle, we show in this paper that it is possible to
build a dierent path-integral made only of bosonic variables. these turn out to be
the coordinates of t (t m) which is the double cotangent bundle of phase-space.

1 introduction

in this paper we continue the study of the path-integral formulation of hamiltonian
classical mechanics started in ref. [1] and continued in ref. [2]. here in particular we
provide a better understanding of the geometrical meaning of the space spanned by
the variables (a, ca, a, ca) entering that path-integral [1]. instead of reviewing here
all the previous work, we suggest that the reader not familiar with the formalism read
refs. [1, 2] before embarking in this paper.

in refs. [1, 2] we showed that, somehow magically, our path-integral was giving us
tools which provided the full cartan calculus [4] on symplectic spaces but we failed
in giving a geometrically clean understanding of the full space we were working on.
in those papers there were some incorrect statements regarding the nature of the full
space. it took us some time to fully understand which space those variables,(, c, , c),
were spanning because both a and ca transformed as basis of the vector elds so
both of them seemed to span the tangent bundle t m to the phase-space m whose
coordinates we called . later on things started clearing up .

the rst things that got clear was a puzzle we had on the role of the variables a. in
ref. [2] we had supposed that the a transform, under a (symplectic) dieomorphism
of the phase-space variables a, as the basis of the vector elds. the transformations
are indicated in eqs. (a9) of ref. [2]. but at the same time we knew that the a , under
the time evolution, change as indicated in eq.(3.16) of ref. [1]. now time-evolution is
a particular symplectic dieomorphism so (3.16) of ref. [1] should fall in the class of
transformations (a9) of ref. [2]. but this is not the case, as it is easy to see inspecting
the two transformations. in (3.16) of ref. [1] there is in fact an extra piece containing
the anticommuting variables c, c which is not present in (a9) of ref. [2]. which is
the correct transformation? the extra piece present in (3.16) seems to ruin the clean
geometrical character of the a which,we thought, were the basis of the vector elds.
we had that belief because in ref. [1] we proved (see eq. (3.32)) that at the operatorial
level a = i 
a . because of that belief we postulated the transformations (a9) of
ref. [2].

we prove here in section 2 that the correct transformation (under any dieomor-
phism) is the one of ref. [1] with the extra piece made of grassmannian variables1.this
extra piece does not spoil the geometrical meaning of  as the the basis of the vector
elds. the reason being that one should consider which is the correct space of func-
tions on which the vector elds act as a derivative. a further indication that those
of ref. [1] should be the correct transformations comes from the fact that under those

transformations the hamiltonian fh entering our path-integral is an exact scalar while

1we will see that it is easy to generalize the transformation from the time evolution to any general

dieomorphism.

it was not so under the other transformation as shown in appendix a of ref. [2].

another issue which we have claried in this paper, and on which we made wrong
statements in ref. [1, 2], is the manner to build symmetric tensors. if we use the partial
geometrical results already obtained in ref. [1], we can show that any form-valued anti-
symmetric tensors can be build out of the variables (, c, c). motivated by this result
we then thought that the symmetric tensors could be built using the  in place of the
c. but it is not so unless we provide a symplectic connection. details are provided in
section 3. several calculational details are conned in an appendix at the end of the
paper.

cleared up this fact we turned in section 4 to study the geometrical nature of our
space. the thing we notice is that the ca, together with the a, make not really a
cotangent bundle t m to phase-space2 but a space known in the literature as reversed
parity tangent bundle [3] which is indicated as t m. putting all this together we
show in section 3 that the space spanned by the full set of variables (, c, , c) is the
cotangent bundle to the reversed-parity tangent bundle of phase-space indicated as
t (t m).

the reader may feel a little up uneasy with the strange grassmannian double bundle
we produced with our variables. to lift this uneasiness we provide in section 5 of this
paper a purely bosonic path-integral whose 8n-variables are the coordinates not of a
grassmannian bundle but of a more natural t (t m) which is the double cotangent
bundle to phase-space.

2 correct transformations of 

as we said in the introduction the main goal of this paper is to clarify the geomet-
rical meaning of the space spanned by the variables (a, ca, a, ca). the rst puzzle
we encountered was the following: both a and ca transformed under a (symplectic)
dieomorphism of  (which are the coordinates of the phase-space m) as the basis of
vector elds [1, 2]. for  this was clear from the fact that in the operatorial formu-
lation associated to our path-integral one had a = i 
a , while for c we transformed
it that way because [1] c = 
ca and ca transforms as a form. we thought that it was
a little bit strange that we had two copies (one grassmannian and one commuting)
of the basis of vector elds. the rst idea was that maybe we had done a mistake in
considering  as the basis of vector eld. this thought come from considering how the
a change under the simplest of (symplectic) dieomorphisms that is the hamiltonian
evolution. the lagrangian associated to our path-integral [1] is:

el = ah a  abbhi + ica [a

2we erroneously stated that in refs. [1, 2]

b t  accbh] cb

(1)

2

where h is the hamiltonian3 of our system in the phase-space m. from the el above

we can derive the equation of motion for  4:

ta = iijjah  iciijjbahcb

(2)

from (2) one can derive the transformation under an innitesimal time interval t:



a = hb

a  bjjahti b  iciij (jbaht) cb

(3)

let us compare this transformation with the one of eq.a9 of ref. [2] which is the correct
one if  were the basis of the vector elds and it is:



a =

b
a

b = hb

a + a(bccg)i b

(4)

where g is related to the innitesimal (symplectic) transformation a = a  a() as
follows: e = (f g)f e. for the innitesimal time evolution of eq.(3), the g would be
g = ht. in that case eq.(4) would become



a = hb

a  bjjahti b

(5)

we see immediately that this is not the correct time-evolution given by eq.(3) the
second piece containing c and c is totally missing.

the extra piece, under a generic (symplectic) dieomorphism generated by the g of

eq.(4), would turn this equation into:

a = a + ij(jag)i + iciij(jbag)cb


(6)

let us rst see the eect of this extra piece on the transformation properties of el of
eq.(1) and on the associated fh which is

fh = aabbh + icab(acch)cb

using eq.(4) the variation5 of fh was given in ref. [2] (under eq.(a9)) and was6:

(7)

(8)

fh = fh()  fh() = icbcaf c(ch)bf (ae)eg) + o(g2)

3repeated indices are meant as summed all through this paper
4note that the term with the c and c variables has a dierent sign than in [1]. the correct one is

the one written here in this paper.

5of course we change not only  but also the other variables. these ones are changed as in eq.

(a9) of ref. [2].

6with eh() we indicate an eh of the same form (in the new variables) as the one of eq.(7) but

with h replaced by the canonically transformed h  indicated in eq.(a9) of ref. [2].

3

with the new transformation of eq.(6) there will be an extra piece in the variation

of fh. this extra piece will come only from the part of fh containing .it is easy to nd

this extra variation7:

extrafh = (extraa)abbh = iciij(jbag)cballh

let us now sum the two variations (8) and (9)

totfh = fh + extrafh

= icbcaf c(ch)ae(ebf g) + iciij(jbag)cballh

(9)

(10)

if, in the rst piece on the rhs of this equation, we relabel the indeces in the following
manner a  i,f  a,c  l, e  j, and in the second piece we bring the last c-variable
in front, we get:

totfh = icbcial(lh)ij(jbag)  icbciallhij(jbag) = 0

of course this is true up to terms o(g2) but this does not matter because g is innites-
imal in an innitesimal transformation.

(11)

haves as a scalar under a (symplectic) dieomorphism. to complete the calculations

so we have proved that the transformations (6) leave the fh invariant or better fh be-
we will now show that the lagrangian el is actually invariant8 without the need to
transformation (4) the el changes as

in appendix a of ref. [2] we proved that under the

use the equations of motion9.

el = el + icbca

f b

the third piece on the rhs of the equation above comes from the term on the rhs

under the legendre transformation. as we know that under the new transformation

only to check if even the second piece on the rhs of eq.(12) will disappear under the

a containing 

of eq.(8). it is the same in fact but with the opposite sign because el is related to fh
(6) the fh will not have that extra piece, the same will happen for el. we have now
new transformation (6). actually in el we have the kinetic piece 
and not present in fh. this will produce, thanks to the new transformation (6), an
fact mean el(,   ) = el(,   ) while scalar means el(,   ()) = el(,   ). invariant for a

7of course we keep transforming the other variables , c, c as in eq. (a9) of ref. [2]
8we keep using the word invariant but it is wrong, we mean scalar. invariant would in-

lagrangian would imply there is a conserved quantity under those transformations and, of course, it
is not the case here ! we are only checking the covariance property of our lagrangian.

9that was a need we had in ref. [2] eq.(a10).

extra term which may cancel the second piece in the rhs of (12). this is in fact so.
the extra piece produced is: iciij(jbag)cb a which is exactly the opposite of the
second piece on the rhs of (12). so this proves that, with the new transformation (6)
we obtain, instead of (12), the following:

el(,   ) = el(,   )

so it seems that the correct transformation for  is (6) which has the extra-piece

containing the grassmannian variables c, c.

the reader may suspect that the extra piece present in the transformations of  is

needed only if we insist in having a new fh with the same form of the fh of eq.(7), that

means if we insist in having the -derivative of an hamiltonian ow [1, 2]. we will prove
that this is not the case. if we start from the generic lie-derivative lv of an arbitrary
vector-eld v (not an hamiltonian one) it can be written [4] in a coordinate free way
as lv  div + iv d where d is the exterior derivative and iv is the interior contraction
with the vector eld v . as lv is a coordinate free expression it must be invariant under
any change of coordinates (or dieomorphism). that lie-derivative in our notation [1]
can be written as:

(13)

(14)

fhv  av a + icabv acb

and10 we will show that in order to have invariance of this generic lie-derivative

under any dieomorphism we need the extra piece in the transformation of .

let us transform the variables entering entering fhv as:

a = a  ()
ca  = ca  cbba
a = ca + cbab
c
a = a + bab

v a = v a  v bba

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

where ()a is a vector eld generating a generic dieomorphism11
10we see that, if v a = abbh, we end up in our lie-derivative of the hamiltonian ow (7). of

course not any v can be written that way, only the hamiltonian ones.

11it is easy to see that if a = abbg we would end up with our transformations (a9) of ref. [2].
these last transformations are called symplectic dieomorphisms because they would lead to a new
v  which could still be written as an hamiltonian vector eld v a = abbh  with only a dierent
h. with the calculations shown in the rst part of this chapter we can say that (if we use the new
transformation for ) the lie-derivative of an hamiltonian vector eld is invariant under symplectic
dieomorphism. what we will prove next is that we need that dierent transformation of  also to
prove that a generic lie-derivative is coordinate free (or invariant) under a generic dieomorphism.

5

it is a simple calculation to show that under the transformations above fhv is not

invariant:

if in eq.(18) we transform  with the extra ghost piece as:

fhv  fh

v   fhv = icav mbmacb

a = a + bab + ici(abi)cb


(20)

(21)

then we get that fhv = 0. so even for a generic lie-derivative under a generic

dieomorphism we have to change  in a dierent way in order to have invariance of
the lie-derivative. this proves that this change of  is a fundamental property and
it is not related to having treated only the lie-derivative of hamiltonian ows under
symplectic dieomorphisms.

we have anyhow now to reconcile what we proved above with the fact that, at the

operatorial level, we had got [1]

a = i



a

(22)

we say that we have to reconcile these two facts because we thought that eq.(22) would
a , would transform as the basis of vector

imply that the a, being proportional to 
elds i.e. as indicated in eq.(4) and not as in eq.(6).

the way to reconcile this is the following :

a would transform as a vector eld if
it were applied to functions only of , i.e. f (), but it would transform dierently if
it were applied to functions of  and c, i.e. f (, c). we will now show that, if applied
to these last functions, it would transform as the a do in eq.(6).



as explained in appendix a of ref. [2], under the same (symplectic) dieomorphism

which is applied to , the  and c transform as:

a = a  abbg
ca = [a

b  accbg] cb

(23)

(24)

note that the transformed c depend on  via g. let us now take a function of  and
c, i.e. f (, c) and let us transform its arguments.

f (, c) = f [(), c(, c)]  s(, c)

if we now apply 

 on s, we have


 s(, c) =

=



f


f [(), c(, c)] =


 +

f
c

c

(25)

(26)

(27)

comparing the two rhs of the above equations we can say that:


a =

b
a


b +

cb
a


cb

(28)

using the operatorial correspondence [1]

eq.(28) as



a = i

a and 

a = ia, we can re-write

i

a = i

b
a

b +

cb
a cb

(29)

one could say that in general cb

a = 0 because c and  are independent coordinates.
actually it is not so because as, we saw in eq.(24), the transformed c depend on  and
viceversa the original c depends on the transformed . so cb

a 6= 0.

let us now proceed to see if eq.(29) is the same as eq.(6). from eqs.(23)(24) and

(16) we can derive its inverse which is:

and from here we get:

a = a + abbg()
ca = [a
b + accbg] cb

a + biiag

b
a = b
cb
a = bcciagci

inserting these expressions into eq.(29) we obtain



a = hb

a + biiagi b  i(bcciag)cicb

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

where we have replaced c with c because we keep only term with are rst order in
the innitesimal g. bringing now c in front on the second term of the rhs of the
equation above we get:



a = hb

a + biiagi b + icbbcciagci

(35)

which is exactly the transformation for  we had in eq. (6). so this proves that
a but over the functions f (, c) and this is turn implies that

operatorially a act as
the base-space we should consider rst is the one made of (, c).



7

3 symmetric tensors

having cleared the issue of the transformations of the  let us now turn to another
topic which was only briey mentioned in refs. [1, 2]. the topic is the following: a
generic function of the coordinates (, c, c), i.e.

f = f abm

i,j,n()cicj    cncacb    cm

(36)

represent a form-valued anti-symmetric tensor elds. this is so because [1] the ca are
forms while the ca transform as vectors (17). so the strings of ca in (36) gives to the
f the character of an anti-symmetric multivector [5] while the strings of c makes it a
multi-forms. stripping it of the c variables we get a simple anti-symmetric multivector
eld:

t = t abm()cacb    cm

(37)

somehow this statement was already present in refs. [1, 2] where forms and tensors
were written with our variables ca, ca and all the cartan calculus was given in details.
in those same references [1, 2] we gave hints that symmetric tensors could be built
by replacing in (37) the ca (which are anticommuting and provide the anti-symmetric
character of the tensor t ) with the variables a which, being commuting, appeared as
the natural objects to build symmetric tensors. we wrongly thought that objects like:

s = s abm()ab    m

(38)

would transform as symmetric tensors. the reason why this is wrong is because the
a do not transform as indicated in eq.(4), i.e, as vectors, which would make the s a
symmetric multivectors, but they transform as indicated in eq. (6). so, as the a are
not anymore vectors, the s are not anymore symmetric multivectors. the same would
happen if we use the operatorial representation of  i.e. a = i 
a . for example,
let us build a symmetric object with two indices which would be: s ab 
b it is well
a
known that, while a single derivative
a would transform as a vector component, a
double derivative 
b would not transform as the product of two vector components,
a
unless we introduce a connection [6].







so the problem is to check if in our formalism we can nd a manner to build not
only anti-symmetric but also symmetric tensors and eventually even mixed ones. for
the moment let us focus our attention on the symmetric ones.

we see that without a connection there is no manner to make symmetric even a
2-tensor. so the new crucial ingredient to pull in our construction seems to be a
connection . a connection is an object needed to do the parallel transport of vectors
[6]. under a dieomorphism a = a() of the space m, the connection does not

8

transform as a tensor but in the following manner:

a

cb =

r
c (

a
l l

rm

m
b +

2i

rb

a
i )

(39)

usually people associate a connection with a space endowed with a metric but this
is not a necessary condition. in fact connection can also be built [7] out of a space
equipped only with only a symplectic structure  as our space m is. the dierence
with metric spaces is that, while there the requirement that the connection preserve the
metric scalar product between vectors plus that it is torsionless makes the connection
unique, in symplectic spaces the analogue requirement that the connection preserves
the symplectic scalar product12 does not make the connection unique [7]. even if not
unique what is important is that there is a symplectic connection on any symplectic
manifold (see proposition (2.5.2) on pag.66 of ref. [7]). few more details are contained
in the appendix.

using a symplectic connection we can now build the following object which is a

generalization of the variable :

a  a + iclm

al cm

(40)

and we can prove (see the calculations in the appendix ) that , dierently than  (see
eq.(21)), transforms as a vector under a dieomorphism generated by a vector eld
a(), i.e:



a = a + bab

(41)

one more thing that we would like to study is the manner to rewrite the lie-

of an hamiltonian ow where v a  abbh with h a function in phase-space but not

derivative fhv (14) using the variables a. we will restrict ourselves to lie-derivatives
necessarily the hamiltonian of the system. the reason we want to rewrite fhv using
 is because fhv was a scalar despite the fact that it was built out of objects like a
which did not have a tensorial character. it seems more natural to write fhv out of
objects which have a clear tensorial character as . let us rst rewrite fhv of eq.(14)

in the following way:

fhv  av a  icbbv aca

(42)

here we have just exchanged c with c with respect to eq.(14). the dierence between

this fhv and the one of eq.(14) is zero because the extra piece which would be produced

is av a which, with v a = abbh, is zero. this extra piece would be produced if we
think of the c and c as acting inside the path-integral and so having an anticommutator
dierent from zero. let us now replace the a in (42) with the a using the relation

12by symplectic scalar product between two vectors v a and w b we mean: v w  v aabw b.

9

(40). we obtain:

fhv = v a[a  iclm

= v aa  icb[bv a + a
 v aa  icb;bv aca

al cm]  icbbv aca
mbv m]ca

(43)

in the last line of the equation above we have introduced the covariant derivative on
vectors v a which is dened [6] as ;bv a  bv a + a
mbv m. the covariant derivative
has the well-known [6] property that ;bv a transform as a tensor under dieomorphism

of  while the usual derivative bv a does not. looking at eq.(43) we see that fhv has
the same form as the fhv of eq.(42) but with the replacements:

a = a
a = ;a

(44)

(45)

was a covariant quantity (a scalar), it was natural to expect that it would not change

these substitutions replace non-covariant expressions with covariant ones. as the fhv
at all under this replacement and in fact the fhv in eq.(43) is the same, even if written

with covariant quantities, as the one in (42).

using this analysis we could ask the question of when is that an observable o(, , c, c)
is a scalar. the answer is the following: take o and use the relation (40) to replace
 with . if what you get has the same functional form in  as o had in , with at
most the ordinary derivatives replaced by covariant derivatives, then o is a scalar.

let us now turn to the initial issue of building symmetric tensors. this is something
we failed in doing [2] by using only . the only thing we succeeded was in building [1]
anti-symmetric tensors using the c. let us note that, besides transforming correctly as
a vector, the a also commute among themselves. thanks to these properties we have
a manner to build symmetric tensors as

t  t abnab    n

(46)

this13 settles one of the points which was not clear in [1]. what seems really impossible
in our formalism is a manner to build mixed tensors. the reader may be tempted to
build strings of objects containing both  and c like p = p abclmnabc    clcmcn,
but this is anti-symmetric in the exchange of the c among themselves and symmetric
in the exchange the  among themselves and with the c so it is not a mixed tensor.

13 the reader should remember that here we mean commuting among the  not in an operatorial
sense but in the sense of considering c and c entering the  as grassmannian variables which anti-
commutes among themselves. the c acquires the operatorial meaning of being the 
c only once it is
inserted into the path-integral. here,instead, in building the tensors t of eq.(46) we do not need to
use the path-integral at all, that is why the  commutes among themselves.

10

4 geometric structure.

in this section we will try to understand which kind of space is the one labeled by our
8n coordinates (, , c, c) and correct some wrong statement present in [1] [2].

as we said at the end of section 2 the base-space to be considered is the one labeled
by (, c). let us then rst nd out which kind of space is this. a are the 2n coordinates
of the phase-space m. the ca transform under a dieomorphism (see eq.(16)) as the
forms da. so we stated in refs. [1] [2] that, identifying c with d, the space (a, ca)
makes up the cotangent bundle [4] to phase space: t m. that is wrong !. in fact
ca are at most a basis in the ber t 
m. being the
c a basis they belong to what is called [8] the bundle of linear frames to14 m. so the
(a, ca) are nothing else than a section of the linear-frame-bundle15. we say a section
because there are other basis (or frames), besides ca, which one could choose in the
bers of the linear-frame-bundle.

 m and not a generic vector in t 

as we stressed the structure above holds if one identies ca with the da. we
did that identication in ref. [1] and used it to turn the whole cartan calculus into
operations which could be done via our path-integral and the structures (commutators,
brs charges, etc) present in it. of course the fact that the ca transforms as the da
does not force us to identify them so explicitly as we have done in ref. [1]. for example
if we build a generic vector eld v  v a 
a , we would have that the components
v a transforms as the ca, so we could do this identication and the ca would then be
components (and not basis) of the vectors in the tangent bers and they would make
up with the  the tangent bundle to phase-space t m. the problem is that the ca have
a grassmannian nature and not like the v a a bosonic one. in that case the bundle is
called [3] reversed parity tangent bundle and indicated as t m.

next we have to consider the role of the 4n remaining variables (a, ca). looking at
the lagrangian in (1) we see that they play the role of momenta to the variables (a, ca),
so they will make the cotangent bers to the previous space. we can summarize all
this in the following scheme:

(a) = m

(a, ca) = t m

(a, ca, a, ca) = t (t m)

(47)

(48)

(49)

on the other hand in ref. [1] (eq.3.33) we proved that the ca act, in the operatorial
counterpart of our path-integral, as ca = 
ca . moreover in the previous section of
14actually the bundle-of-linear-frames is made out of basis of the tangent bers while ours is of

cotangent bers, but the two are isomorphic.

15that way to look at our variables is the one we basically adopted, without realizing it, in refs. [1] [2]

and in the previous three sections of this paper.

11

this paper we proved that a , despite their strange transformation properties (6), still
maintain their operatorial meaning of being: a = i 
a . from these two expressions
we can say that (a, ca) form a basis in the tangent bers to the base-space (a, ca).
as this base-space was t m, the over-all 8n coordinates (a, ca, a, ca) can also be
considered as a section of the bundle of linear frames over t m. this is an alternative
interpretation of our 8n variables with respect to the interpretation contained in eq.
(49). this sort of duality between considering each of our variables (, c, c) either as
basis or as coordinate could be considered at each of the levels of eqs.(48)(49) and gives
rise to all possible combinations. we will anyhow stick here to the coordinate-picture
which will lead to the reversed-parity bundle of eq.(49).

beside this sort of duality which would allow us to see in two dierent ways the
spaces labeled by our variables, there is a further freedom. this is related to the
scheme of eqs.(48)(49). let us perform a partial integration in the kinetic piece of the
grassmannian variables present in the lagrangian (1). modulo surface terms the new
lagrangian is

l  a[ a  abbh]  icaca  icaaccbhcb

(50)

being this lagrangian dierent from el only by a surface term, the equations of motion

for ca and ca are the same, but now ca plays the role of a congurational variable while
ca is its relative momentum. then it would seem natural to choose in eq.(48) as new
variables (a, ca). let us see its geometrical interpretation: the ca transform as (17) so,
interpreting the ca as coordinates and not basis, they transform as components of
forms but with grassmannian character, i.e. with the reversed parity character. this
means that the (a, ca) are the coordinates of the reversed parity cotangent bundle:

(a, ca) = t m

(51)

from the lagrangian l of (50) we see that a and ca play the role of momenta to
the previus variables so they belong to the cotangent bers of the previous space. all
together then we can write all this in the following scheme

(a) = m

(a, ca) = t m

(a, ca, a, ca) = t (t m)

(52)

(53)

(54)

as the physics contained in the lagrangians l and l is the same and the same are
the coordinates, we could say that our variables label both spaces either t (t m) or
t (t m). a more mathematically precise proof of this is contained in ref. [10].

5 entirely bosonic path integral.

the reader may feel a little been uneasy with these grassmannian double bundle we
have provided in the previous section and even with the alternative interpretation as
sections of the frame bundle. for this reason in this section we will show that, at least
for hamiltonian ow, it is possible to provide a path-integral of classical mechanics
made entirely of bosonic variables. moreover we will prove that these variables are just
the coordinates of a standard double bundle like t (t m). the procedure to achieve
what we said above is explained below.

the path-integral [1] for classical mechanics (cm) was basically the following. we
wanted to create a generating functional z(j) which would give to each path not the
feynman weight exp i
h s but weight 1 if the path was a classical one and weight zero it
was a non classical one. so essentially:

z(j) = z d [(t)  cl(t)] expz jdt

(55)

b and
where cl are the solutions of the hamiltonian equations of motion:
the [] is a functional dirac delta. it is easy to realize [1], neglecting the current j for
a moment, we can rewrite (55) as

a = ab h

z[j] = z d [(t)  cl(t)] = z d[ a  ab h

b ]det[a
= z dadadcadcaexp iz eldt

l t  ab 2h

bl ] (56)
(57)

where the det[] appearing in eq.(56) is a functional determinant [1] and the el in (57) is

the lagrangian of eq.(1). it is obtained by doing the fourier transform (via the variables
a) of the dirac delta in the second term of eq.(56) and exponentiating the det[] with
grassmannian variables ca and ca. in order to avoid using the grassmannian variables
the trick we adopt now is to substitute the det[] in (56) with an inverse determinant:

det[a

l t  ab 2h

bl ] = {det[a

l t + ab 2h

bl ]}1

(58)

we will give a detailed proof of this relation in the appendix.

the next step is to use relation (58) into (56), then exponentiate the inverse of

the matrix using bosonic variables by making use of the well known formula16:

z dxidyj exp ixiaj

i yj  {det[aj

i ]}1

(59)

16this formulas requires that the determinant be positive and this is our case because the lhs of

(58) is positive [1].

13

doing all that we get

z[j] = z d[ a  ab h

b ]{det[a

l t + ab 2h

bl ]}1

= z dadadadaexp iz ldt

where

l = a[ a  ab h

b ] + l[a

l t + ab 2h

bl ]a

(60)

(61)

(62)

the variables l and a are the bosonic variables we have used to exponentiate the

inverse matrix and they replace the grassmannian variables ca and ca present in el of

eq.(1)

let us now see if we can give a geometrical understanding of the new variables a,a
present here. let us show how they change under the hamiltonian ow, that means
under their equation of motion which can easily be derived from the lagrangian l
above:

tl + aab 2h

bl = 0

(63)

this equation should be compared with the equations of motion of ca derived [1] from

el of eq.(1) which are

tca  ab 2h
bl

cl = 0

from the above equations it is now easy to see that the quantity

  aca

(64)

(65)

is invariant under the hamiltonian ow. this quantity would behave in the same way
under any dieomorphism of the phase-space m and not just under the hamiltonian
ow17. the invariance of  is the same thing that would happen to a form18

  ada

(66)

and by identifying the da above with the ca of eq.(65) we see that we can identify
a of (65) with the components a of the forms of (66). so while the ca are the basis
of the bers on t m, the a are the coordinates of the same space. looking at the
lagrangian (62) we see that a and a are the momenta associated to a and , that
means they will make up the cotangent bers to the previous space, so the overall set
of variables (a, a, a, a, ) are the coordinates of t (t m). this is a double bundle

17this is so because we would have to choose the transformations on  and  induced by the

dieomorphism in  in such a way to keep invariant the hamiltonian associated to l.

18 this is so because forms are object totally coordinate free.

14

but it may please more the reader that the reversed parity one t (t m) associated

to the lagrangian el of (1). it may be a space easier to handle for the study of various

physical issues like the study of ergodicity and lyaupunov exponents [9] we performed
previously using the old lagrangian (1). it may also be worth to see if the universal
symmetries (brs and supersymmetry) we found in [1] [9] are present (in a dierent
form) also in this purely bosonic case presented here.

6 conclusions

in this paper we have settled several geometrical issues still opened in the path-integral
approach to classical mechanics.we think that the light shed on the dual aspects of
the geometrical interpretations of the grassmannian variables is something important
and long overdue. at the same time we have disentangled the puzzles related to the 
variables understanding the manner to build symmetric tensors. last but not least we
have to say that having cleared all the geometry involved has helped us in our search
for a purely bosonic path-integral overall we think that it was not useless to do all
this work especially considering the relevant role that geometry is having in physics in
the last ten years.

appendix

in this appendix we provide some calculational details which will make the paper self-
contained.

 as we said in section 3 there are various extra conditions which one could impose on
the symplectic connections. one condition, which anyhow will not make the connection
unique, is the requirement that the connection be torsionless which is equivalent to
saying that it be symmetric in the two lower indices [6]: c
ba. for the reader not
familiar with torsion we can frase this requirement in the following other form: having
a connection one can build a covariant derivative on the space of forms. it is easy to
see that, if we write forms as f = fabmcacb    cm, the covariant derivative acting on
them is

ab = c

(67)

a 


a  clm

al



cm

using it we could then obtain a new exterior derivative. the old one was [1] d = ca 
a
and the new one would be d  caa = ca[ 
cm ]. here one see immediately
that if  were symmetric in the two lower indeces, the d would turn into the old exterior
derivative d. so requiring this symmetry in the lower indices would not only make our
theory torsionless but it would also prevent the appearance of two dierent exterior
derivatives.

 as we promised after eq.(40) we will show here that  transforms as a vector
under a dieomorphism of the phase-space : a  (). let us rst write  as
a = a + iwa where (see eq.(40)) wa  clm
alcm. we know how  transforms under
the dieomorphism indicated above (see eq.(29) and so we have only to nd how w
changes under the same transformations. using the transformations rules for  (eq.(39)
and for c and c which are:

ca =

c
a =

cb

a
b

a cb

it is a simple but long calculation to show how the wa transform:

w 

a =

combining the equation above with (29) we get that

(71)

if the transformations is generated by a vector eld () i.e.:a = a  a() then
eq.(71) becomes exactly eq.(41). eq.(71) proves that  transform as a vector. somehow
the extra pieces in the transformations of  (eq.(29)) got cancelled by the extra pieces
in the transformations of w (in eq.(70).

 we will now give a formal proof of formula (58). the determinant in (58) are

functional determinant that means:

det[a

l t  ab 2h

bl ]  det[a

l t(t  t)  (t  t)ab 2h

bl ]

= {dett}{det[a

l (t  t)  (t  t)ab 2h

bl ]}

(72)

(73)

to prove (58) is equivalent to saying that the determinant of the product of the two
matrices appearing respectively on the lhs and rhs of (58) is one. using the form of
the matrix written in eq.(73), this means19:
a(t  t)  (t  t)al 2h

c(t  t) + (t  t)bk 2h

det {z dt[b

kc ]} =

lb ][b

(74)

(75)

det {a

c (t  t) z dt(t  t)(t  t)al 2h
lb
bk 2h

 exp z dt(t  t)(t  t)al 2h

lb

ka = 1

bk 2h

kc }

in (75) we have used the exp-tr form for the determinant and fact that the two ()
give zero. so this proves the relation (58).
