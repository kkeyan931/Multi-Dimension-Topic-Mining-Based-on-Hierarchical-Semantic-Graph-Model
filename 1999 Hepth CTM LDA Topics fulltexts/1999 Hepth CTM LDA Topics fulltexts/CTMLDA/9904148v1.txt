using a boundary counterterm prescription motivated by the ads/cft conjecture, i evaluate the
energy, entropy and angular momentum of the class of kerr-nut/bolt-ads spacetimes. as in the
non-rotating case, when the nut charge is nonzero the entropy is no longer equal to one-quarter of
the area due to the presence of the misner string. when the cosmological constant is also non-zero,
the entropy is bounded from above.

the thermodynamic properties of gravity have for long appeared to be inextricably connected with the presence
of black holes [1,2]. a physical entropy s and temperature 1 can be ascribed to a given black hole conguration,
where these quantities are respectively proportional to the area and surface gravity of the event horizon(s).

recently it has been demonstrated that entropy can be associated with a broader and qualitatively dierent gravi-
tational system, one containing misner strings [3]. these objects are the gravitational analogues of dirac strings, and
arise whenever the gravitational eld in the euclidean regime has a u(1) isometry group (generated by a timelike
killing vector ) with a xed point set of co-dimension df < d  2 (called a nut [4]). the existence of any xed
point set makes it impossible to everywhere foliate the spacetime with surfaces of constant  , leading to a dierence
between the total energy (h) and free energy of the gravitational system, which thermodynamically is proportional
to its entropy. in general a spacetime can contain both black holes (for which df = d 2  called a bolt) and misner
strings, and the total gravitational entropy will receive contributions from both of these objects.
explicit demonstration of these ideas has been given in a number of cases, for spacetimes with and without cosmo-
logical constant. at rst it was thought that the presence of a bolt (i.e. black hole) was necessary [3,5,6] since the
misner string contribution to the entropy is divergent  only the relative entropy (and energy) between a spacetime
with a bolt/nut conguration and its asymptotically matched pure nut counterpart was calculated. however it has
more recently been shown that misner strings themselves have an intrinsic entropy [7,8], even if no bolts are present.
by adding to the action an additional boundary term which is a functional of the intrinsic curvature invariants on
the boundary, the equations of motion are unaected and the gravitational entropy (and total and free energies) is
nite whether or not there is a bolt. the inclusion of this boundary term is motivated from recent work [9,10] on the
conjectured ads/cft duality, which equates the bulk gravitational action of an asymptotically ads spacetime with
the quantum eective action of a conformal eld theory (cft) dened on the ads boundary. the coecients in the
additional term may be uniquely xed by demanding that it be nite for schwarzchild-ads spacetime. however the
spacetime need not be locally ads asymptotically  locally asymptotically at cases may also be included [7].

the purpose of this paper is to extend these considerations to to include rotation. specically i consider the
class of euclidean kerr and kerr-ads solutions with and without nut charge in four dimensions. this class of
spacetimes forms an important test case for the counterterm prescription and has received relatively little attention
in the literature [11,12]. even for kerr spacetimes with zero nut charge and cosmological constant the problem
of computing quasilocal energy is very dicult and has only been carried out in the slow-rotating limit [13]. the
counterterm prescription given in ref. [7] extends to the full kerr-nut class, reproducing the values of the mass and
angular momentum without any background spacetime subtractions. when the nut charge is non-vanishing, i nd
that the presence of rotation does not admit the existence of regular spacetime solutions unless a bolt is also present.
furthermore the rotation parameter has no upper bound when the nut charge and cosmological constant are nonzero.
the entropies for these spacetimes are also computed and are not proportional to their horizon areas due to the
misner strings. this is the rst calculation of the entropy of rotating spacetimes with nut charge. only the main
results will be presented here; details will appear in a forthcoming paper [14].

consider a euclidean manifold m with metric g, covariant derivative , and time coordinate  which foliates
m into non-singular hypersurfaces  with unit normal u.  (whose trace is ) denotes the extrinsic curvature of
any boundary(ies) m of the manifold m (internal and/or at innity), with induced metric(s) . the path-integral
formulation of quantum gravity implies that the euclidean action i =  log z to lowest order in h, where z is the
partition function of an ensemble

z = z [dg][d] exp[i(g, )]

(1)

with the path integral taken over all metrics g and matter elds  that are appropriately indentied under the period
 of  . the thermodynamic denition log z = s  h then implies that the entropy of a given spacetime is

s = h  i = (e +   j)  i

(2)

where e and j are respectively the energy and angular momentum of the spacetime at innity and  the angular
velocity at the event horizon. the entropy is then the dierence between the value the action would have (h, the
total energy) if there were no breakdown of foliation and its actual value (proportional to the free energy).

 pi in i

 . rewriting the im i

one could compute this dierence by removing small neighbourhoods n i

 of the xed point sets and strings so that
i = im i
 into hamiltonian form (taking care to include the additional surface terms due
to these new boundaries), one nds that the only non-zero contributions to the hamiltonian are from the boundaries
at innity and along the strings. when the contributions in i
 from the small neighbourhoods of the xed point sets
are re-inserted, their surface terms are non-vanishing and yield the one-quarter of the areas of the neighbourhoods
removed, i.e. of the bolts and the strings.

the action is generally taken to be a linear combination of a volume (or bulk) term

(4)

(chosen to yield a well-dened variational principle), where l() is the matter lagrangian and  the cosmological
constant. when evaluated on solutions both iv and ib are typically divergent, yielding divergent values for both
the string area and hamiltonian terms and hence for the entropy. one method of dealing with this diculty is
to compute everything relative to some chosen reference background spacetime (suitably matched in its asymptotic
and topological properties) whose boundary(ies) have the same induced metric(s) as those in the original spacetime
[1517]; the reference spacetime is then interpreted as the vacuum for that sector of the quantum theory. such a
choice is not always unique [18], nor is it always possible to embed a boundary with a given induced metric into the
reference background. indeed, for kerr spacetimes this latter problem forms a serious obstruction towards calculating
the subtraction energy, and calcuations have only been performed in the slow-rotating regime [13].

the counterterm proposal involves adding a term ict to the action, where [7]

ict =

r()

(5)

with  = p3/||. the coecients of the r() term and the overall action are determined by demanding that the

schwarzchild-ads solution have nite total action it = iv + ib + ict. the prescription (5) has been shown to be
sucient for evaluating the actions, entropies and total energies for the schwarzchild, taub-bolt, and taub-nut
spacetimes, along with their ads and topological extensions without the use of any background subtractions [7,8].
it is motivated by the conjectured ads/cft correspondence: divergences appearing in the stress-energy tensor of
the boundary cft are just the standard ultraviolet divergences of quantum eld theory and may be removed by
adding counterterms to the action which depend only on the intrinsic geometry of the boundary. quantities such as
energy, entropy and (as will be shown) angular momentum are then intrinsically dened for a given spacetime, rather
than with respect to a reference background. furthermore, (5) applies even in the    limit, thereby including
asymptotically locally at cases, unlike the prescriptions in refs. [810] to which (5) reduces for small .

using (5) the entropy is

where all quantities are evaluated on a given solution, and where h = m + j, with m = q[/ ] and j = q[/]
being the conserved charges associated with the killing vectors / and / where  = a/(r2
+  a2  n 2), with
r+ dened below. these conserved charges are given by [16,19]

s = h  (iv + ib + ict)

which may be shown by taking the variation of the action with respect to the boundary metric  at innity .

where the periodicity in  and the parameters q and  are chosen so that conical singularities are avoided. in the

(, ) section these considerations imply that q = 4 and  = 1/p1 + a2/l2.

the periodicity in  is more subtle. the location of the nut is at r = a2 + n 2  rn , where the area of surfaces

orthogonal to the (r,  ) section vanishes. the misner string singularity runs along the z-axis from the nut to innity.
regularity along the z-axis then implies that  has period 8n . however regularity in the (r,  ) section implies that
 also has period 2/ where

(10)

where v (r+)=0, r+ being the location of the foliation breakdown. interpreting this latter equation as determining m
in terms of r+, equating these two periods yields a quartic constraint (cubic if l  ) on r+ in terms of a, n and
l. a more careful treatment is required if r+ = rn ; in this case regularity of the solutions demands that v (r) have
a double root there. however this requirement turns out to be incompatible with the periodicity constraints unless
a = 0. hence r+ > rn , and there are no regular kerr-nut or kerr-nut-ads solutions (the former observation was
made in ref. [11]).

using the formulae (7), i nd after somewhat lengthy and tedious calculation

(11)

for each of the kerr, kerr-ads, kerr-bolt and kerr-bolt-ads solutions, the parameter m obeying the constraints
mentioned in the previous paragraph in the bolt case. the actions, hamiltonians, and entropies for each case are
nite. the results are given in table i; omitted is the hamiltonian for each case, which is simply h = m
4 (1 + a).
after substituing the solutions for m and r+, the action in the kerr-bolt case is 4n m, in agreement with ref. [11].
note that for the bolt solutions the entropy is not one-quarter of the area, due to the presence of the misner string.
one of the more unusual results apparent from table i is that in the kerr-bolt-ads solution the entropy is not
positive for all values of the parameters. the entropy is always positive for any values of a and l provided 19k 6 
78k 4 + 3k 2 + 8 > 0, or k > km = 2.02282556..., where k = r+/rn . however for 1 < k < km there exist ranges
of values of a/n for which the entropy is negative, and for certain values of a the entropy diverges to . similar
properties have been noted in the non-rotating ads nut and bolt solutions [7,8]. the entropy s = s/n 2 as a function
of x = a/n is plotted in fig.1 for the kerr-bolt solution  for small x s  5 + o(x2), and for large x, s  4x.
the parameter m is an everywhere dened increasing function of x, and approaches 2n for large x. the behaviour
is quite dierent in the the kerr-bolt-ads solution. for a given k > km, s reaches a maximum somewhere between
x = 0 and x = xm; for x > xm, the parameter l2 < 0 and so there are no allowed solutions. for k < km, the entropy
(and m) will be negative in some allowed region of x (i.e. where l2 > 0. figures 2 and 3 show typical cases.

to summarize, the prescription (5) has been shown to apply to spacetimes with non-zero angular momentum, and
so removes the troublesome aspects of evaluating physical quantities in gravity relative to some chosen background
[13,18]. indeed, the expressions for e, j and s could all be given quasilocally at nite radius r, although i have
omitted them here for the sake of brevity. as with the non-rotating case, these results must be carefully interpreted.
for n 6= 0 the boundary at innity is not a direct product s1  s2 but instead is a squashed s3. consequently
continuation to the lorentzian regime is not straightfoward the way it is in the n = 0 cases. the most promising
possibility is that of interpreting the path integral over all metrics as the partition function for an ensemble of
spacetimes with xed nut charge [3,5]. a more complete understanding of the thermodynamics of these solutions
(and how to interpret the negative values of the entropy in the ads case), as well as the relationship between these
results and the behaviour of a conformal eld theory on the boundary remain interesting questions for further study.
