photon splitting and photon-plasmon

interaction in a dense medium

v.v. skalozub and a.y. tishchenko
dnepropetrovsk state university, ukraine

three-photon vertex in a dense degenerated plasma is calculated. it is discovered the polar-

ization tensor has the longitudinal part which makes possible an interaction between transverse

and longitudinal modes in the medium. using dispersion relations it is shown that the only

kinematically permitted type of the photon splitting is the decay of the transverse photon to

two plasmons

1. introduction

the photon splitting is the process with minimal rank of nonlinearity
in the electromagnetic interactions. this kind of reaction is to be real-
ized in various astrophysical objects (white dwarves, neutron stars), the
early universe and in the heavy ion collision experiments.
in all these
cases furrys theorem is violated because of the presence of the environ-
ments such as external elds or dense media. the photon splitting due to
a magnetic eld has been rather intensively investigated by many authors
[1]. this process was also considered in the rest plasma [2] and the uni-
formly moving medium [3]. in the latter article the three-photon vertex
has been calculated in one-loop approximation for the most general case
but the nal expressions represented in terms of complicate integrals, that
makes dicult the detailed analysis of the corresponding amplitude. be-
sides, there were some calculation peculiarities that have not been taken

into account and therefore must be pointed out. first it is the use of feyn-
mans parametrization. as it was proved by weldon [4], the employing the
parametrization at nite temperature and chemical potential could lead
to errors for some ratios of the momentum components p0/p. the second
problem arises because of the covariant decomposition the authors elabo-
rated. this decomposition allows to investigate some general properties of
the polarization tensor in moving medium but the basis chosen automat-
ically excludes a longitudinal part which tends not to be zero in general
case, as it will be shown below.

taking all this in mind, we carry out another investigation of the three-
photon interaction in dense cold medium. in sect.2 we present straightfor-
ward calculation (without feynmans parametrization) of the three-photon
vertex in one-loop approximation for arbitrary relations between the mo-
menta and the frequencies of the photons. we do not use the covariant
decomposition and perform the calculations separately for the temporal,
the spatial and the mixed components of the polarization tensor. for the
most important range of momenta and frequency for the high density limit
(  m, , |~k|)the nal results have been obtained in terms of elementary
functions. therefore the analytical properties of the vertex can easily be
analysed. one of the most interesting features discovered is the longitu-
dinal part of the polarization tensor which becomes zero when  = |~k|.
obviously, the existence of the longitudinal part makes it possible the in-
teraction between the transversal excitations (photons) in medium and the
longitudinal ones (plasmons) via the three-photon vertex.

in sect.3 we consider the photon splitting process for real particles.
to investigate that the corresponding dispersion relations were obtained.
basing on these relations the kinematic analysis of the splitting has been
done and it was shown that the only type of the permitted process is the
splitting of photon to two plasmons. section 4 contains the conclusions.
in appendix the expressions for the component of the polarization tensor
are presented.

the neutron stars and cores of white dwarves are the examples of degen-
erate qed plasma where t   and therefore fermi distribution function
can be well approximated by step function. for such environment the
three-photon tensor can be expressed in euclidean space as follows

(k, k, k)(k + k + k) = (1)

corresponding feynman diagrams are pictured n fig.1.

because of the reasons mentioned in the introduction we in our calcu-
lations will avoid either the feynman parametrization and the covariant
decomposition. instead, we will perform straightforward integration for all
the tensor components.

while integrating over spatial part of the momentum space one faces

the integrals like

z ~p f (p, k, k) d3p,

(4)

4

where f (p, k, k) are certain scalar functions.

here we represent ~p as a sum of two components that are transversal

and parallel to the plane created by ~k, ~k, ~k

~p = ~p + ~pk

(5)

taking into account the symmetry properties of f (p, k, k) one can easily
show that only parallel component ~pk contributes to integrals (4). so for
further calculations we need basis consisted only of two independent vectors
within reaction plane. we chose them as

~a = ~k + ~k,
~b = (~k  ~k)  (~k + ~k) = ~k((~k~k) + ~k

2

)  ~k((~k~k) + ~k

2

)

(6)

(7)

expanding ~pk over the normalized basis gives

~pk = ~a

( ~pk~a)
~a 2 + ~b
where s  |~k  ~k| and

~q(k, k) = ~k ~k

(10)

the integration over hard momenta (, |~k|  ) makes small con-
integrating over the region

|~k|! which can be neglected.

tribution    

(, |~k|  ) (1) we obtain nal expressions for high density limit ( 
m, , |~k|). these expressions are bulky and placed in appendix.

having the results for the polarization tensor in analytical form, one
can see that its components are proportional to chemical potential.
it
means that dense medium may amplify processes corresponding to the
three-photon interaction.

next we can note, all the components contain -function with four-
momentum squared in its argument. such a dependence restricts the
participation in three-photon interaction in dense medium admitting only
time-like excitations.

5

one of the most important features of the three-photon vertex can be
discovered if to calculate the contraction k. one can convinced that

k  k2.

(11)

so, the polarization tensor has a non-zero longitudinal part which becomes
zero on the mass-shell of free photons. as for physical meaning of this
result, one can say the existence of the longitudinal part makes possible
an interaction between transverse (photons) and longitudinal excitations
(plasmons) via tree-photon vertex in dense medium.

3. dispersion relations and photon-plasmon interaction

all the results in previous part has been made for arbitrary relations
between momenta and frequencies of external photons. for studying the
processes with the real particles in medium we need the corresponding
dispersion relations. this type of calculation has been made by several
authors for dierent cases [5]-[7].

the relations mostly match our purposes have been obtained in ref. [6]

and in our notations look as follows

the dispersion relations obtained are plotted in fig. 2, where the solid
line represents the plasmon mode and the dashed line shows the photon
mode. as it is seen from the plot, both excitations are time-like and
therefore can interact via the three-photon vertex.

having the dispersion relations we are able to analyse the kinematics
of splitting of the real photon in dense media. let us consider symmetric
decay of photon with frequency  and momentum ~k to two photons with
frequencies /2, angle between their momenta  and modulus of momenta

|~k|

2 cos 
2

. for this case we have

7

(18)

ft (, |~k|) = 0,
ft ( 
2 ,

2 cos 

|~k|

2

) = 0.



solving this system numerically we nd it is has no solutions. therefore,
the photon splitting to two photons is kinematically forbidden.

making the similar consideration for other cases we obtain that the
only permitted by kinematics process is the decay of the photon to two
plasmons. the solving of the corresponding equations



gives two following results.

ft (, |~k|) = 0,
fl( 
2 ,

2 cos 

|~k|

) = 0

(19)

first, the photon splitting becomes possible if only its energy exceeds
the minimal value  2.70. when the energy of the initial photon exactly
equals to minimal value the angle between the momenta of plasmons is
zero.

besides, if energy of photon becomes greater, the angle increases but its

value limited approximately by 11.

4. conclusions

in this paper we have calculated the tree-photon vertex in one-loop ap-
proximation for dense degenerated medium. the calculations has been
carried out without feynmans parametrization and the covariant decom-
position. the results are represented in terms of elementary functions that
allows the detailed analysis of the analytical properties of the polarization
tensor.

the most important property discovered is the existence of the longitu-
dinal part of the vertex. this part makes possible the interaction between
photons and plasmons in dense medium.

basing on dispersion relations it was shown that all the types of the
three-photon interaction of real particles are kinematically forbidden but

the splitting of the photon to two plasmons. this process becomes possible
if energy of the initial photon is larger than a certain minimal value.
