abstract

recently the long-standing puzzle about counting the witten index
in n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories was resolved. the resolu-
tion was based on existence (for higher orthogonal so(n ), n  7
and exceptional gauge groups) of at connections on t 3 which have
commuting holonomies but cannot be gauged to a cartan torus. a
number of papers has been published which studied moduli spaces
and some topological characteristics of those at connections. in the
present letter an explicit description of such at connection for the
basic case of spin(7) is given.

recently the long standing paradox with counting the witten index in
n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory has been resolved [1]. the essence of the
paradox was that dierent ways of computing the witten index gave dierent
results for the higher orthogonal (so(n), n  7) and the exceptional gauge
groups.

the rst way was to put the gauge theory into a nite spacial box and
to count the number of supersymmetric vacuum states [2] which resulted
in tr(1)f = r + 1 where r is the rank of the gauge group. for higher
orthogonal and exceptional groups, this result disagrees with the one based
on counting of gluino zero modes in the instanton background and also on the
analysis of weakly coupled theories with additional matter super-multiplets
[2, 3].

tr(1)f = h ,

(1)

where h is the dual coxeter number of the group (see e.g. [4], chapt. 6; it
coincides with the casimir t at a in the adjoint representation when a proper

1

normalization is chosen.). for so(n  7), h = n  2 > r + 1. also for
exceptional groups g2, f4, e6,7,8, the index (1) is larger than the wittens
original estimate.

in [1] witten has found a aw in his original arguments and shown that,
for so(n  7), vacuum moduli space is richer than it was thought before
so that the total number of quantum vacua is n  2 in accordance with the
result (1). the derivation in [2] was based on the assumption that a at
connection on 3d torus t 3 can be gauged to a cartan sub-algebra of the
corresponding lie algebra. this assumption seems to be quite natural since
for a connected, simply connected gauge group a connection on t 3 is at
when and only when it has commuting holonomies j, j = 1, 2, 3 over three
independent nontrivial cycles of t 3, and it is very natural to expect that
commuting holonomies are representable as exponentials of commuting lie
algebra elements. nevertheless, it is not true. for higher orthogonal and
exceptional gauge groups there are triples of commuting holonomies which
cannot be represented as exponentials of a cartan sub-algebra elements. this
fact is in the heart of resolution of the paradox in [1].

interestingly, existence of such triples has been known to topologists for

a long (see, e.g. [5, 6], where examples of such triples were constructed).

after the wittens work [1] (see also its interpretation for pedestrians in
[7]) a new interest to such triples has arisen. moduli spaces of such triples
(that is, additional components of moduli spaces of at connections on t 3 for
exceptional gauge group) have been described in [8] and in [9]. later these
results have been re-derived and extended in some respects in [10].

the purpose of this letter is to explicitely describe at connections corre-
sponding to such triples (actually, only the basic case of spin(7) is considered
here; the description is likely generalizable to other cases). although the ex-
plicit description is not needed in the problem of computing the witten index,
it may be useful elsewhere, in particular, in answering the question whether
the existence of the new components of vacua moduli space aects only the
witten index or also some other observables in supersymmetric gauge theo-
ries with orthogonal or exceptional gauge groups. it may also be interesting
per ce.

for spin(7) group there is a unique (up to conjugation) nontrivial triple.

it can be chosen in the form [6], [1]

2

1 = 1234
2 = 1256
3 = 1357,

where and in what follows we use the notation

ijkl... = ijkl . . .

(2)

(3)

and i, i = 1, . . . 7 stand for the gamma-matrices. s in eq.(2) mutually
commute and cannot be conjugated to the cartan torus (see, e.g. [7]).

let x, y, z be coordinates on the cube in r3 which gives t 3 upon iden-
tication x  x + 1, y  y + 1, z  z + 1. we would like to explicitely
describe a at spin(7) connection ai, i = 1, 2, 3 on t 3 which has holonomies
i, i = 1, 2, 3 from eq.(2), that is

0

1 = p exp(cid:18)z 1
2 = p exp(cid:18)z 1
3 = p exp(cid:18)z 1

0

a1(x, 0, 0)dx(cid:19)
a2(0, y, 0)dy(cid:19)
a3(0, 0, z)dz(cid:19) .

0

it will be represented in the form

ai(x, y, z) = g(x, y, z)1 
xi

g(x, y, z)

(4)

(5)

where g(x, y, z) takes values in the group and has the following properties:

g(1, y, z) = 1g(0, y, z)
g(x, 1, z) = 2g(x, 0, z)
g(x, y, 1) = 3g(x, y, 0).

(6)

with s from eq.(2).

obviously, with g(x, y, z) obeying eq.(6) the at connection ai from

eq.(5) is periodical on t 3 and has the appropriate holonomies.

now introduce the following denitions:



2 x(12+34)



2 y(15 26)

(7)

g1 = e
g2 = e
g3 = e



2 z(13+57).

3

gi eq.(7) produces the monodromy i when the corresponding coordinate
changes by 1. the specic choice of gis is related to the following property:

by explicit computation one veries that

[gi, i+1] = 0

gii1 = i1g1

i

(8)

(9)

introduce also g3 such that it commutes with g2 (and, consequently, with

2),

g3 = e



2 z(15 37).

(10)

g3 as well as g3 produces 3 when the corresponding coordinate (z) changes
by 1.

one can also verify that

g31 = 1(g3)1.

using all these properties, one can see that the following g(x, y, z)

g(x, y, z) = g1g2g1

1 g3g1

3 g1g1

2 g1

1 g3g1g2

(11)

(12)

obeys the key property eq.(6), and hence the corresponding at connection,
eq.(5), is periodic and has the monodromies s.
