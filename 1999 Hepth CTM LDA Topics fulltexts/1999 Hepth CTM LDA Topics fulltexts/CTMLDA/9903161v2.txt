we determine from 11d supergravity the quadratic bulk action for the physical bosonic

elds relevant for the computation of correlation functions of normalized chiral operators
in d = 6, n = (0, 2) and d = 3, n = 8 supersymmetric cft in the large n limit, as

dictated by the ads/cft duality conjecture.

0. introduction

the duality [13] between string/m theory on anti-de sitter space (ads) times a

compact manifold and conformal eld theory (cft) living on the boundary of ads is quite

useful in the program of extracting non-trivial information for various strongly coupled

quantum eld theories. the most studied duality relates type iib superstring theory on
ads5  s5 to d = 4, n = 4 su(n ) super yang-mills (ym) theory. in the large n limit,
the ads side of the duality can be approximated by type iib supergravity. in one of the

many applications [4], the latter has been employed to compute 2 and 3 point functions for

chiral primary operators of the super ym theory, whose conformal dimensions had already

been identied in [3] by relating them to the masses of the corresponding kaluzaklein
scalars on ads5  s5. various eorts are being made also to investigate the structure and
compute the more complex 4 point functions (see [58] and references therein).

however, other interesting dualities with maximal supersymmetry (i.e. 16 supersym-

metry charges on the cft side) have been proposed in [1]. according to this proposal,
mtheory on ads7  s4 is dual to the d = 6, n = (0, 2) supersymmetric cft (to be
denoted by scft6). similarly, mtheory on ads4  s7 is dual to the d = 3, n = 8
supersymmetric cft (to be denoted by scft3). these scfts are realized, for example,
on the world-volume of n coincident m5 and m2 branes, respectively. yet, little is known

about them, and the ads/cft duality oers a useful tool to learn more about these re-

markable theories. again, in the large n limit, one can approximate mtheory by its low

energy limit, 11d supergravity. by using that, some groups have identied the conformal

dimensions of the corresponding chiral operators [912]. quite recently the calculation of 3
point functions of chiral operators in the large n limit of the scft6 theory has appeared
in [13].

in this paper, we determine the 11d supergravity quadratic bulk action of the physical

bosonic elds relevant for the computation of the correlation functions of normalized chiral
operators of both scft6 and scft3. in particular, we carefully compute the normaliza-
tion constants of the kinetic terms of the scalar elds, as these numbers are a crucial input

in such calculations.

we have found that the method originally described by lee, minwalla, rangamani

and seiberg in [4] does not yield any sensible result, though we have veried the correctness

of their nal answer. this fact has recently been pointed out also corrado, florea and

mcnees [13]. therefore, we carry out our analysis by extending the method of arutyunov
and frolov [14], originally worked out for type iib 10d supergravity on ads5  s5, to 11d
supergravity on ads7  s4 and ads4  s7. contrary to what claimed in [13], we nd

2

that this approach provides the correct quadratic action. the method is completely self

contained in the sense that it does not require the knowledge of the action beyond the

quadratic approximation. as it consists in isolating the scalar elds of interest by simply

performing eld redenitions, one does not need to put on-shell the scalar uctuations nor

study complicated boundary terms in the supergravity action. moreover, it does not lead

to either non local or higher derivative terms in ads space.

from our nal results, one can read o the masses of the scalar uctuations together

with the searched for normalization factors. needless to say that we reproduce the values
of the masses as originally worked out in [15] and in [16,17] for the ads7 s4 and ads4 s7
cases, respectively. as for the normalization factors, we conrm the result recently obtained
for the ads7  s4 case in [13] by using the same method that, as we learn from that
reference, was originally employed in [4].

in sect. 1, we present the ads7  s4 compactication relevant for scft6. then, in
sect. 2, we describe the ads4  s7 compactication related to scft3. this case presents
a technical complication which we avoid by resorting to a dual formulation. in sect. 3, we

illustrate our conclusions.

1. the ads7  s4 model

the model considered here is the usual 3form formulation of 11d supergravity. the

basic elds of the bosonic sector are the metric g and the 3form eld a. the bosonic part

of the action is

i =

1

42 zm11 hr(g) g 1  f (a)  gf (a) + 2

1
2

3 a  f (a)  f (a)i.

(1.1)

here, r(g) is the ricci scalar of the metric g. f (a) is the 4form eld strength of the

3form a and is given by

f (a) = da.

(1.2)

the space time m11 is taken to have the topology ads7  s4.

then, one can easily verify that the eld equations admit the standard solution gij,
aijk generated by the freund rubin ansatz [18]. for this, the only non vanishing compo-
nents of the riemann tensor and eld strength are given by

r(g) =  1

18 e2(cid:0)g g gg(cid:1), r(g) = 2
f ( a) = e ,

9 e2(cid:0)gg g g), (1.3a)  (1.3b)

(1.4)

3

where e is the compactication scale 1.

we expand the action in uctuations around the background gij, aijk. we parametrize

the uctuations gij, aijk of the elds gij, aijk around the background as in [15]

g = m + n + n + (    1

4 g  )p + 1

 = 0,

m = 0,

above, the ellipses denote terms not containing the elds h, , b. note that the eld
components m, n, k, a, aij are decoupled at quadratic level from h, , b.
also, p and l act as lagrange multipliers enforcing certain constraints. we have focused

1 in this paper, we adopt the following conventions. latin lower case letters i, j, k, l, . . .
denote m11 indices. early greek lower case letters , , , , . . . denote ads7/4 indices.
late greek lower case letters , , ,  . . . denote s4/7 indices.

on the elds , b and those mixing with them, since they contain the scalar uctuations
which couple to the chiral operator of the boundary conformal eld theory of our interest.

at this point, one might partially x the gauge by imposing

(cid:0)g  1

4 gg

g = 0;

(cid:1) = 0,
aij = 0,

(1.8a)  (1.8b)

(1.9)

as shown in [15]. these conditions imply in particular that p = 0 and l = 0 and so, upon
gauge xing, the last two terms of i[2] vanish. the corresponding constraints must then
be enforced by hand.

however, instead of xing the gauge at this stage, we prefer rst to isolate the relevant
scalar degrees of freedom by performing eld redenitions, as done in [14]. we write the
ads metric uctuations as

h =  + g +  

(1.10)

with  and  chosen in such a way to decouple at the quadratic level the eld  from
the b sector. we nd

fixing the gauge involves setting pi = 0, li = 0. thus, after gauge xing, si , ti are

i = 0,

k  1.

(1.24a)

(1.24b)

as a check of our results we note that we have reproduced the masses worked out
in [15]. the particular coecient asi has also been deduced recently in [13] by using
a consistency requirement involving other normalizations and the values of certain three
point couplings. we conrm that result as well.

2. the ads4  s7 model

we now analyze the 11d supergravity compactication on ads4  s7. the relevant
action is again (1.1), where now m11 has the topology ads4  s7. the eld equations
admit the standard solution gij, aijk generated by the freund rubin type ansatz [18].
on this background, the only non vanishing components of the riemann tensor and eld
strength are given by

r(g) =  2

9 e2(cid:0)g g gg(cid:1), r(g) = 1

18 e2(cid:0)gg g g), (2.1a)  (2.1b)

7

f ( a) = e,

(2.2)

where e is the compactication scale.

we parametrize the metric uctuations gij around the background as follows [17]

g = m + n + n + (    1

7 g  )p + 1

7 g,

m

 = 0,

m = 0,

n = 0,

g = k + l,

k = 0,

g = h  1

2 g.

as to the 3-form uctuations, it is sucient for our purposes to use

b =  1

3! a

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

(2.3c)

(2.4)

and denote by a the longitudinal (in s7) components of a. then, the part of the
action quadratic in uctuations is given by the following expression

where the dots indicate a totally decoupled sector which is not relevant for our purposes.
in fact, the scalar elds of interest are contained only in  and b and those elds mixing
with them. one can check this statement by analyzing the corresponding eld equations

(2.6d)

the last two equations are constraints arising from imposing gauge xing conditions analo-
gous to (1.8a)(1.8b) and (1.9), which imply in particular p = 0, a = 0 2. substituting
the solution of the constraints in the rst two equations, one gets

   28

3 e  b +   + 4e2 = 0,

 b +  b  6

7 e = 0,

(2.7a)

(2.7b)

where b is dened by the relation b = b, which solves (2.6d). thus, the above action
describes a symmetric rank 2 tensor h and two scalar elds , b. one can expand them in
spherical harmonics and diagonalize the eld equations (2.7a)(2.7b) to obtain the massive

kaluzaklein towers of scalars of interest [17].

however, we now face a technical diculty. it is apparently hard to diagonalize the

action (2.5) by performing eld redenitions. the reason for this is that, as shown above,
the vector eld b describes simply a scalar eld b. a eld redenition replacing the vector
eld by the scalar one is a form of duality transformation. typically, such transformations

exchange eld equations and bianchi identities and are not easily done at the level of

action in a consistent way by simply substituting in some of the eld equations. in our

case, however, this goal can be achieved by rewriting the original 11d supergravity action

introducing appropriate auxiliary elds. these, when eliminated in a judicious way, realize

the desired duality transformation.

explicitly, instead of the customary 3form formulation of 11d supergravity, we shall

adopt the dual 3/6form formulation worked out in [1920]. in this approach, the basic

elds of the bosonic sector are the metric g, the 3form eld a and the 6form eld c.

the bosonic part of the action now reads

i =

1

42 zm11 hr(g) g 1  h(a, c)  gh(a, c)  2

1

2 2

3 a  f (a)  f (a)i.

(2.8)

r(g) is the ricci scalar of the metric g. f (a), h(a, c) are the 4form eld strength of

the 3form a and the 7form eld strength of the 6form c and are given by

f (a) = da, h(a, c) = dc + 1

21/2 a  da.

(2.9)

1

2 to be precise, (2.6c)(2.6d) holds only up to zero modes of the operators   
7 g   and , respectively [15]. we will neglect this technical complications in the
following discussion for the sake of simplicity.

9

the model must be supplemented with the duality constraint

gh(a, c) + f (a) = 0.

(2.10)

using additional auxiliary/gauge elds, one can incorporate this constraint directly at the
level of the action [20], but this will not be necessary for our purposes.

one can easily verify that the eld equations admit a standard solution gij, aijk,
cijklmn generated by a freund rubin type ansatz [18]. for this, the only non vanishing
components of the riemann tensor and the 4from eld strength are as in (2.1a)(2.1b),
(2.2), while the 7form eld strength is given by

h( a, c) = e .

(2.11)

we expand the action (2.8) in uctuations around the above background. we parame-
trize the uctuations gij as in (2.3a)(2.3c) and write the relevant uctuations cijklmn
as

c = 6 [a] + 
a = 0.

  b,

(2.12)

the uctuations aijk are not independent from gij, cijklmn because of the con-
straint (2.10). we have explicitly checked, however, that the components of aijk that
couple in the action and in the constraint to the elds h, , b give a vanishing con-
tribution to the quadratic action of these latter elds, once the constraint is taken into
account.

therefore, the quadratic action of the elds h, , b could be evaluated by setting

formally aijk = 0 from the beginning. the expression we obtain is

the last two terms of i[2] vanish. the corresponding constraints must then be enforced by
hand.

scalar degrees of freedom by performing eld redenitions, as done in the previous section.
following again [14], we perform a eld redenition of the form (1.12) with  and  chosen
in such a way to decouple at the quadratic level the eld  from the b sector. one

note that, also in this case, the modes si with k = 0, 1 do not appear so that these are
gauge degrees of freedom. fixing the gauge involves setting pi = 0, li = 0. thus, after
gauge xing, si , ti are free elds. on the si, ti mass shell the constraints are again of the
form (1.24a)(1.24b). the mass spectrum coincides with that found in [17], as expected.

3. conclusions and outlook

we have determined from the 11d supergravity action compactied on ads7  s4 and
ads4  s7 the quadratic ads bulk action for two kaluzaklein towers of scalar excitations
described by the elds si, ti . in the ads/cft correspondence these elds are sources
for the boundary scft operators whose dimensions have been worked out in [912] from
the knowledge of their masses reported in [1517]. apart from reobtaining those masses,
we have computed the normalization factors asi, ati which x the normalization of the
2 point functions. we have obtained this result by isolating the leading quadratic term of
the relevant actions through eld redenitions. this has allowed us to remain oshell for
the s, t scalar uctuations, thus avoiding the delicate task of keeping track of all possible
boundary terms. on the other hand, we have found that the onshell method proposed in
[4] is not complete and does not yield the correct result, as noticed also in [13]. presumably
certain boundary terms have been missed in [4].

in the ads7  s4 case, the coecient asi was also recently obtained in [13] using a
dierent method involving the calculation of certain three point couplings. we agree with
their result.

13

in the ads4  s7 compactication, the identication of the normalizations is more
in this case the standard 3form formulation of 11d supergravity gives the

laborious.

o-shell description of a linear combination of the scalars s, t in terms of a vector elds
b. therefore, we have used a dual description which produces directly both scalars and
computed the relevant normalizations.

with these normalizations at hand, one can proceed to compute the cubic st self-

coupling to obtain the large n limit of the three point correlation functions of the corre-

sponding operators belonging to chiral representations of the maximally supersymmetric
scf t3 and scf t6 theories, thus adding extra pieces of information on these somewhat
mysterious theories.
