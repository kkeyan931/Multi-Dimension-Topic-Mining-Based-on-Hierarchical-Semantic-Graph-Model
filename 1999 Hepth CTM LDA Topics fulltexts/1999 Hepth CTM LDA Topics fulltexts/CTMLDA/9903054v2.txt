abstract

we investigate the close relationship between the potential and absorption

cross section for test elds in an ads3 bubble(a 5d black hole) and an exact

ads3. there are two solutions in type iib string theory: an ads3 bubble

corresponds to the dilatonic solution, while an exact ads3 is the non-dilatonic

solution. in order to obtain the cross section for an ads3 bubble, we introduce

the {out}-state scattering picture with the ads3-afs matching procedure.
for an exact ads3, one considers the {in}-state scattering picture with the
ads3-ads3 matching. here the non-normalizable modes are crucially taken

into account for the matching procedure. it turns out that the cross sections

for the test elds in an ads3 bubble take the same forms as those in an exact

ads3. this suggests that in the dilute gas and the low energy limits, the

s-matrix for an ads3 bubble can be derived from an exact ads3 space.

i. introduction

there has been a great progress in string theory of the d1-d5 brane system with mo-

mentum modes along the string direction(s1). this gives us a 5d black hole(m5) with three

charges (q1, q5, qn). the rst progress was achieved in the bekenstein-hawking entropy

[1]. apart from the success of counting the microstates of a 5d black hole through d-brane

physics, a dynamical consideration becomes an important issue [25]. this is so because

the semiclassical absorption cross section (greybody factor) for a test eld arises as a conse-

quence of its potential barrier surrounding the horizon. that is, this is an eect of spacetime

curvature. more precisely, it is worth noting that a semiclassical absorption cross section can
be derived from a solution to the dierential equation of a test eld(most often, 2 = 0)
on the supergravity side.

the ads/cft correspondence states that string theory in the ads is dual to a con-

formal eld theory(cft) dened on its remote boundary of ads [6]. the semiclassi-

cal limit of spacetime physics is related to the large n limit of the dual cft. a 5d
black hole(m5s1t4) becomes ads3s3t4 near horizon but with an asymptotically
at space(afs) [7]. recently this is called an ads3 bubble in afs and corresponds to

the dilatonic solution [8]. in this case the matching procedure is crucial for obtaining an

absorption coecient and here we need to match an ads3 bubble to afs.

on the other hand, one obtains ads3s3t4 as the other solution to the type iib string
theory. this is an exact ads3 with asymptotically ads3 and corresponds to the non-dilatonic

solution [9]. further it includes the btz black hole [10]. we point out that the near horizon

limit of a 5d black hole yields the btz black hole, whereas this solution accomodates to

the btz black hole spacetime as a whole.

it was understood that the greybody factor calculation makes sense when one nds

an asymptotically at region as in sec.ii [6]. hence it may not be possible in an ads3

because there is no asymptotic state corresponding to particle at innity of ads3. however,

the authors in [9] calculated the greybody factor for a free scalar and the dilaton both

2

in m5s1t4(an ads3 bubble) and ads3s3t4(an exact ads3) within the type iib
supergravity. here in the exact ads3 calculation we choose the non-normalizable modes

to obtain the greybody factor. this corresponds to the ads3-ads3 matching procedure.

this expression denotes shorthand for a certain choice of boundary conditions where non-

normalizable modes inject ux into ads3. it turns out that two results of a free scalar are

exactly the same. and the results for the dilaton are the same upto a factor 3. these

show a close relationship between two approaches. more recently, vacuum correlators of the

dual cft4 were expressed as truncated n-point functions for the non-normalizable modes

in ads5. one can interpret this result as an s matrix of an exact ads5 arising from a limit

of scattering from an ads5 bubble [8]. this supports that our calculation based on the

non-normalizable modes is correct.

in this paper we will show that the s-matrix of an ads3 bubble can be derived partly

from an exact ads3 space. this is one of the current issues in the ads/cft correspondence.

for this purpose, we investigate the close relationship between the potential and absorption

cross section in an ads3 bubble and an exact ads3. comparing an ads3 bubble with an

exact ads3 leads to an assumption that the potential of an exact ads3 is the left-hand side

of an ads3 bubble. for this study, we introduce the {in} and {out}-state pictures for an
ads3 bubble. for the exact ads3 study, one needs the {in}-state as well as non-normalizable
modes. further, we introduce the test elds for scattering analysis. these are in an ads3

bubble : a free scalar() which, in the decoupling limit, relates to an (1,1) operator o in
the holographically dual theory; two xed scalars(, ) to (2,2), (3,1), and (1,3) operators;

two intermediate scalars(, ) to (1,2) and (2,1) operators. on the exact ads3 side, the test

elds are a free scalar(), the dilaton(), an intermediate scalar(), and the tachyon(t ).

the organization of this work is a follows. sec.ii is devoted to analyzing the scattering

from an ads3 bubble within a 5d black hole. this corresponds to a conventional scattering

study. we study the scattering of the test elds in an exact ads3 in sec.

iii. in this

case we are careful for obtaining the absorption coecient because we cannot dene the

asymptotically at space. finally we discuss our results in sec. iv.

ii. scattering from an ads3 bubble in a 5d black hole

initially we introduce all perturbing modes in a 5d black hole background. it is pointed

out that in s-wave calculation the xed scalars are physically propagating modes and other

elds belong to be redundant modes [5]. hence we choose two xed scalars (, ) and a free

scalar() as the relevant modes. we begin with the 5d black hole with three charges,

ds2

5d = hf2/3dt2 + f 1/3(h1dr2 + r2d2
3),

where

f = f1f2fn =  1 +

(2)

(3)

hence the d-brane black hole depends on the four parameters (r1, r5, rn, r0). the event

horizon (outer horizon) is clearly at r = r0. when all three charges are nonzero, the surface

r = 0 becomes a smooth inner horizon (cauchy horizon). when at least one of the charges

is zero, the surface r = 0 becomes singular. the extremal case corresponds to the limit

of r0  0 with the boost parameters i  , keeping the charges (qi) xed. we are
interested in the limit of r0, rn  r1, r5, which is called the dilute gas limit. this is so
1, q5 = r2
because this limit corresponds to the near-outer horizon. here we choose q1 = r2
5,

and rn = r0 sinh n with a nite n. this corresponds to the near-extremal black hole and

its thermodynamic quantities (energy, entropy, hawking temperature) are given by

outer horizon(r = r0).

we note that vn depends on two parameters (r0, r) as well as the energy(). as (11)

stands, it is far from the schrodinger-type equation. the -dependence is a matter of

peculiar interest to us compared with the schwarzschild black hole potentials (vrw , vz, v)

[12]. this makes the interpretation of vn as a potential dicult. as is shown in fig.1, this

6

arises because (f  1) is very large as 106 for r0 = 0.01, r = 0.3 in the near-horizon. in order
for vn to be a potential, it is necessary to take the low energy limit of   0. it is suitable
to be 103. and 2(f  1) is of order o(1) and thus it can be ignored in comparison to the
remaing ones. now we can dene a potential vn = vn + 2(f  1). hence, in the low energy
limit(  0), eq.(11) becomes as the schrodinger-type equation. further the last terms in
(12)-(13) are important to compare each other. after the partial fraction, these lead to

here 0 denotes the s-wave(l = 0) free scalar and 2 the free one with l = 2. this is also

observed from the graphs of potential in fig.2 with r0 = 0.01, r = 0.3. because the shape
of their potentials takes nearly the same form (v  v  v l=2
), these give us nearly the
same reection coecient r = |r|2 and absorption one a = |a|2. for example, in the low
energy limit of   0, , , 2 take nearly the zero-absorption cross section. furthermore all
potentials go to zero, as r approaches innity. this implies the existence of the asymptotic



states outside an ads3 bubble. the size of an ads3 bubble is from r0 = 0.01 to r = 0.3.

b. scattering from an ads3 bubble

we are interested in the scattering of the test elds o vn (r). it is well known that
the scattering analysis is usually done by choosing a coordinate such as   r  .
it is always possible to visualize the black hole as presenting an eective potential barrier

(or well) to an incoming test wave. one expects that some of the incident wave will be

irreversibly absorbed by the black hole, while the remaining fraction will be scattered back

to the innity. in this scattering we can calculate the reection and transmission(absorption)

coecients [13]. as is shown in fig.3, we note that all potential barriers vn (r) take nearly

the symmetric forms around r = 0 when they are rewritten by a tortoise coordinate r [14].

also they are localized at r = 0. since vn (r)  0 as r  , one nds

d2 n
dr2 + 2 n = 0.

asymptotically(r  ) the solution is given by

n out

(19)

(20)

considering the time-part of eit, the rst is an incoming wave() and the last is an outgoing
wave(). near the horizon it is purely incoming() as

n out

n ()eir.

(21)

we call this type of solution as {out}n and the corresponding vacuum state is dened as
bi|0iout = 0.

in order to study the hawking radiation, we introduce another boundary condition.

asymptotically the wave is purely outgoing()

(22)

(23)

we call this type of solution as {in}n and its vacuum state is dened as ai|0iin = 0. the
vacuum states |0iout and |0iin form two dierent bases of which any state can be expanded
in terms of the other. these are two dierent fock space vacuum states and {out}n and
{in}n are related to each other by the bogoliubov transformation,

(24)

(25)

the computation of hawking shows in a semi-classical approximation that the thermal

radiation from the black hole with temperature th is given by [15]

hni = inh0|bi bi|0iin = xk |ik|2 =

e/th  1
n |2  4/3 = aout
with an absorption cross section n
constant, hni is the same as that of a black body. typically, n
the deviations from the black body spectrum have earned it the name greybody factor.

5d is not constant but varies.

n 4/3. note that if n

5d = |aout

here we dene the s-matrix from {in}n and {out}n as [14]



s() =

.

here an incident wave(eir ) of unit amplitude from r = + gives rise to aout
n () and
n (). on the other hand, an incident wave(eir ) of unit amplitude from r = 
rout
gives rise to ain

n (). the relation between these is given by

n () and rin

(28)

(29)

(30)

the above relations establish the symmetry and unitarity of the s-matrix in the ads3 bubble

scattering. actually an () can be calculated from the backscattering of an incident wave

n o the potential vn (r). it is not easy to nd out the absorption amplitude an directly
in the complicated potentials such as vn (r). in this case one use the ux f of the incoming
wave to obtain the absorption coecient

n = f ()
aout
f ()

,

(31)

where f ()(f ()) are the uxes at the horizon(innity). in this way we can calculate
the semiclassical absoprtion cross section.

e. ads3-afs matching procedure and absorption cross section

here we use the matching procedure between an ads3 bubble (near-horizon of a 5d

black hole) and asymptotically at space to obtain an absorption coecient. first consider

the matching of a free scalar. here the matching point resides on 0 < r <  in fig.3. in

here we consider the geometry of an exact ads3(ads3s3 t4) as the other solution
to the type iib string theory [9]. this corresponds to the non-dilatonic solution. this

geometry can be led the btz black hole spacetime as a whole by the periodic identication.

scalar( = 3/4) [17]. for the tachyon( = 1), one has (, ) and for an intermediate
scalar( = 3), one nds (3, 1/). instead of the plane-wave from, here one nds the
power-law behaviors of  [20]. the non-normalizable modes are found as 1/2 for the

dilaton and 1/ for an intermediate scalar, which diverge as  approaches the timelike
bounadry(  0). the positive powers of  all belong to be the normalizable modes,
which converge at spatial innity. we note that the tachyon takes only the normalizable

modes [19]. this can be easily conjectured from its shape of potential vt . the s-wave free

scalar takes a constant-behavior at innity. this makes an diculty in dividing  into
an ingoing and outgoing modes at spatial innity [21]. actually it is impossible to dene

an ingoing wave and an outgoing wave at spatial innity of an exact ads3.

instead in

the asymptotically ads3 space it contains the normalizable as well as the non-normalizable

modes. the latter will play an important role in calculation of the absorption coecient
ain
 .

c. scattering from an exact ads3

first we note that  covers only the left-hand side(    0) of the whole space.
in the case of where the black hole geometry is asymptotically at as a 5d black hole,

the tortoise coordinate r goes from  to . hence this is similar to the innite string
problem in which the initial data propagates towards left and right indenitely [17]. the

initial data no longer enjoys this privilege when the background is asymptotically ads3
because the tortoise coordinate  goes from  to 0 only. one may consider this as
the semi-innite string problem(or a nite cavity with reecting walls in ads5 [22]). then

the dirichlet or neumann boundary condition at spatial innity( = 0) is required to

formulate the problem appropriately. however, we take a dierent point of view to attack

an asymptotically ads3 problem. this is based on the observation of the shape of potential

18

and the global structure of an exact ads3 [10]. we rst construct the potential v() by
replacing  in (70) with   + coth(+/r2). the potentials in fig.5 look like the half
of the ads3-bubble potentials. especially, we observe that the free eld potentials v l=0
 ()

and v l=2

 () in fig.5 take nearly the same form as in v l=0

(r), v(r), v(r))
in the region of   r  0 in fig.3. furthermore the penrose diagram of an exact
ads3(    0) is an half of the would-be whole diagram in      [10].

 ) as functions of  for an exact ads3.

in this work we assume that the potential of an exact ads3 is the left-hand side one of an

ads3 bubble. the important thing is to calculate the absorption cross section in the back-

ground of an exact ads3. considering the {in}-state picture, it is not hard to calculate the
 . although the {out}-state cannot be dened, we can derive ain
absorption coecient ain
from the backscattering of a test eld  o v(). if we choose the boundary condition ap-



propriately, the of potential fig.5 is enough to calculate the absorption coecient, regardless

of the would-be right-hand side(0    ). in this backscattering process, the key point
is to use an appropriate matching procedure between a near ads3 and an asymptotically

19

ads3. we remind the reader that  = 0 is a timelike bounadry and thus information enter
or exit from it. this is an exact middle point if one assumes a whole space of     .
thus requiring the conventional boundary condition may lead to a wrong result in deriving

the absorption coecient. instead of the dirichlet condition of |=0 = 0, one may use the
non-normalizable modes. the non-normalizable mode is a divergent quantity at  = 0 but

its ux is nite at  = 0. also it corresponds to specifying another boundary condition

at spatial innity. on the other hand, if one use the normalizable modes which satisfy the

dirichlet boundary condition, one may not succeed in obtaining the absorption coecient

in an exact ads3.

d. ads3-ads3 matching procedure and absorption cross section

in order to calculate the semiclassical absorption cross section, we have to solve the

exact dierential equation eq.(62) with an appropriate boundary condition. since it is

dicult to solve eq.(62) directly, one has to use the matching prodecure between the near-

horizon(  +) ads3 and the far-region(  ) ads3. here the matching point resides
on  <  < 0 in fig.5.

in the far region eq.(62) becomes




+

3
x




+


x2  = 0

with a dimensionless variable x = /r. one easily nds the far-region solution

(x) = hx1+1 + x11i

(79)

(80)

with two unknown constants , . the rst term is a divergent quantity at  =  but
behaves well in the interior region. this corresponds to the non-normalizable modes and

is coupled to the boundary operator o at innity. the second one is the normalizable
mode and propagates in the bulk. this can be used to construct two, three and four-point

functions. although one cannot dene an ingoing ux at innity of ads3, one can calculate

the total ux. the ux at spatial innity is given by

20

f () = 2q1  (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

  i (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

.

(81)

we note here that for the tachyon with  = 1, f t () = 0. this is because the tachyon
takes only the normalizable modes which are to be zero at innity. thus we exclude it from

our analysis.

in order to obatin the near-horizon behavior, we introduce the new variable z = (2

in order to obtain  and , we use the matching procedure. it is important to remember

that the present spacetime is an exact ads3. thus we have to match the near-ads3 with

asymptotically ads3 to nd an absorption coecient. we know the far-region behavior of

this 6d result is derived from ads3s3. in order for this to match with the cross section of

one nds a6d

us slightly dierent cross sections in an ads3 bubble, whereas these(2, ) do not make any

distinction in an exact ads-theory.

iv. discussions

it seems that the s-matrix cannot be extracted from the anti-de sitter space even in a

limit [22,23]. this is based on the fact that in an exact ads3 the asymptotic states cannot

be dened, due to the timelike bounadry and the periodicity of geodesics. however, the

authors in [8] showed that the correlation functions of the dual cft4 to ads5 are considered

as the bulk s-matrices. the vacuum correlators ho(x1)o(x2)   o(xn)icft4 of the cft4
are expressed as truncated n-point functions convolved against the non-normalizable modes.

these can be interpreted as an s-matrix for an exact ads5 arising from a limit of scattering

from an ads5 bubble in asymptotically at space.

in this work, we show that the s-matrix of an ads3 bubble can be derived from an exact

ads3 in the dilute gas and low energy limits. we conrm this from the calculation of the

absorption cross section. this originates from the fact that the near-horizon equations for

an ads3 bubble (32) and an exact ads3 (82) are the same form, but they have dierent

in the ads3 bubble-calculation, one uses the ads3-afs

boundary conditions at innity.
matching to obtain the absorption coecient aout
n . on the other hand, in the exact ads3-
calculation we use both the {in}-state picture and the non-normalizable mode to obtain the
absorption coecient ain
 . this amounts to taking the ads3-ads3 matching. the s-wave
greybody factor of a free scalar of an ads3 bubble has exactly the same form as that of an

23

exact ads3. for the dilaton we nd the same form of cross section  = c a6d
with c = 1/4 for an ads3 bubble and c = 1/12 for an exact ads3.

h (r0/r)4 but

let us compare our results with the others. the general formular for the gerybody factor

is derived from the vacuum two-point function ho(x)o(0)icft2 of a boundary operator o in
the eective string [24] and boundary cft2 approaches [25]. these give us the same result

for a free scalar but for the dilaton, c = 1/4 as in an ads3 bubble. consequently, the two-

point correlator provides us the greybody factor in the dilute gas and low energy limits. this

quantity takes exactly the same form in the cft2 and ads3 bubble approaches. further, in

the exact ads3 approach one nds the same form of the greybody factor. this means that

the s-matrix can be derived from an exact ads3 space. it is obvious that the conformal

limit of the gauge theory(cft2) corresponds with scattering from an exact ads3. finally

we present here a scattering picture in an exact ads3 and compare it with the scattering of

an ads3 bubble in afs.
