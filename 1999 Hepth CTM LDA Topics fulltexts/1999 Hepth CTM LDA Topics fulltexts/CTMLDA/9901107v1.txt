abstract

the numbers of bosonic and fermionic zero modes of multi-pronged strings
are counted in n = 4 super-yang-mills theory and compared with those of
the iib string theory. we obtain a nice agreement for the fermionic zero
modes, while our result for the bosonic zero modes diers from that obtained
in the iib string theory. the possible origin of the discrepancy is discussed.

i. introduction

the recent development of non-perturbative string theories has provided new powerful
tools to understand the supersymmetric gauge theories. the low energy dynamics of the
d-branes are described by the supersymmetric gauge theories. the bps spectrum of the
supersymmetric theory will then correspond to the bps congurations of strings and branes
ending on the background brane congurations.

various known properties of the n = 4 su(n) supersymmetric yang-mills theory have
been studied based on n parallel d3-branes. the bps state spectrum of the massive gauge
bosons, monopoles and dyons preserving half of the supersymmetry are identied with the
(p, q) strings connecting two separated d3-branes. with more than two d3-branes, we can
have the string junction congurations [1] that preserve only 1/4 of the supersymmetries
[2,3]. the condition for the string junction congurations gives the set of eld equations
describing the corresponding bps states of the gauge theory [38]. in addition to the rst
order dierential equations describing the 1/2 bps states of monopoles, the string junction
needs a second order equation of the gauss law. the eld theoretic solutions corresponding
to multi-pronged strings were explicitly constructed for su(3) theory [5,6] and generalized
to su(n) theory [7,8].

to study the quantum properties of this string junction, one needs to understand the
zero modes around the classical congurations. as in the case of monopoles [9,10], the
bosonic zero modes will correspond to the collective coordinates of the moduli space, while
the fermionic zero modes correspond to the spin structures of the supermultiplets. the
number of zero modes of monopoles with an arbitrary gauge group is well known [11].

in this paper, we will count the number of bosonic and fermionic zero modes of the
multi-pronged strings in the su(n) eld theory and compare it with that of iib string
picture [12]. the number of fermionic zero modes was already discussed for a specic su(3)
solution in ref. [6].

in section 2, we briey describe the bps equations describing the string junction and the
zero mode equations. in section 3, we count the zero modes. the equations of the bosonic
zero modes consist of those for the magnetic monopole and one more second order equation.
usually, the index, i.e., the number of the zero modes is evaluated by asymptotic expansion
of the eld congurations [11]. however, for the string junctions, the method of evaluating
the index by the expansion of the electric elds fails. instead, we will count the bosonic and
fermionic zero modes based on considering the constraints imposed on the zero modes of
multi-monopoles. the detail of mathematical arguments are in the appendix a. in section
4, this counting is shown to be dierent from that based on the type ii string theory. in
section 5, we summarize our main results, and indicate future directions.

ii. multi-pronged strings and their moduli space

we begin by recapitulating the basic properties of 1/4 bps states in the n = 4 su(n)

super-yang-mills theory, whose lagrangian, for the bosonic part only, reads

l = 

1
4g2

trhf f + 2didi  2xi<j

[i, j]2i

(1)

2

where f  a  a  i[a, a], di  i  i[a, i] and the indices i and j
run from 1 to 6. it is well known that, in this theory, the monopoles, the dyons and the
w-particles preserve half of sixteen supersymmetries of the theory. it is shown recently that
there may be also 1/4 bps states that preserve a quarter of the total supersymmetry. as
shown in refs. [3,12], these states describe multi-pronged strings connecting n d3-branes in
the type iib string picture. examples of closed-form solutions corresponding to the pronged
strings were found in the n = 4 su(n) super-yang-mills theory [58]. we shall investigate
the number of both bosonic and fermionic zero modes of the the multi-pronged strings in
the n = 4 super-yang-mills theory for the gauge group su(n). this will be the rst step
to extract the structure or geometry of the moduli space involved with the multi-pronged
strings. thereby, one is ultimately interested in obtaining the low-energy eective dynamics
of the multi-pronged strings.

the bogomolnyi bound for the 1/4 bps states can be found by considering the energy

functional of the n = 4 system,

m =

1
2g2

ymz d3xtr"ee+bb + di di + d0id0i xi<jhi, ji2# .

(2)

introducing two orthonormal six vectors ei and bi, we present the energy equivalently by

m =

2g2

ymz d3xtr"(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ei e+bibdi (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(3)

where i
bi, and we have used the gauss law constraint

 refers to components of the six-vector perpendicular to the unit vectors, ei and

de + ihiei, d0j eji + ihibi , d0j bji = 0 ,

(4)

and the bianchi identity db = 0 to perform the integration by part1. this, then, implies
that the energy is bounded from below by

where we dene the charge six vectors as

ymm  qi

eei + qi

m bi ,

qi

qi

e z d3xtrei = qp
m z d3xtrbi = qp

ehip,

m hip.

(5)

(6)

for the equalities, we used the asymptotic condition,

1 the gauss law is, in fact, given by d e + i[i , d0i ] = 0 but, with a restriction set by the
bogomolnyi equation d0i

 = 0, one may consistently use the form given here.

hii = hiphp ,

(7)

where hp is the n  1 mutually commuting operators that span the cartan subalgebra. the
raising and lowering generators e,

are normalized by

[hp, e] = pe ,

[e, e] = php ,

(8)

(9)

where p are the roots. we will choose the simple roots p by requiring hipbi p > 0 for the
maximal symmetry breaking2 case along ibi .
the saturation of the bound occurs if [48]

di = ei e + bi b , d0iei = 0 , d0ibi +i[iei, j bj ] = 0

and

[i

, j

] = 0 , d0i

 = 0 .

(10)

(11)

there are two types of bps states that may be classied by considering two n = 4 central
charges given by [4]

z =qkqi

ek2 + kqi

m k2  kqi

ekkqi

m k sin 

(cid:16)  [0, )(cid:17) .

(12)

where  denotes the angle between the charges vectors. for  = 0, the state preserves
the eight supersymmetries and these are described eld-theoretically by the monopole, the
dyons and w-particles. with non-vanishing , the two charge-vectors are no longer parallel,
and the state preserves only 1/4 of the supersymmetry. we will be mainly concerned on
these 1/4 bps states.

owing to the tracelessness of the charges, this, in fact, guarantees the balance of tension
of the corresponding multi-pronged junction. moreover, one nds a restriction on the electric
and the magnetic charges

qp

ehipbi  qp

m hipei = 0

(13)

which turns out to be the balance condition of the torque applied on the associated d3-branes
by the pronged string. this restriction follows from

qp

ehipbi = qi

ebi =z d3xtredibi

=z d3xtreb =z d3xtrbdiei = qp

m hipei

(14)

2we consider only the case of the maximal symmetry breaking in the direction of i bi for simplic-
ity. obviously, this condition may be lifted to study the eect of nonabelian symmetry breaking.

where we used the bogomolnyi equation and the denitions of charges.

the geometric shape of the junction and the meaning of the charges may be clearly
found by xing our six coordinate system. for later purpose, we shall denote ibi  a4,
and iei  x and further set i

 = 0 without loss of generality.

the bps equations (10) are rewritten as

with the gauss law,

b = da4 ,
e = dx ,
d0x = 0 , d0a4 + i[x, a4] = 0 ,

ddx  [a4, [a4, x]] = 0 .

(15)
(16)
(17)

(18)

let us now choose a gauge a0 = x. eqs. (16) and (17) then lead to a relation am = x = 0
(m = 1, 2, 3, 4), which implies any solutions of the bps equation are static with this gauge
choice.

eq. (15) is the usual bps monopole equation. hence the junction bps state is a kind
of monopole surrounded by w-boson cloud, which is determined by eq. (18). topological
argument leads to the quantization of the magnetic charge by

qm = 4

n 1xa=1

maa

p hipbi ,

(19)

where the integer ma counts the number of each fundamental monopole.

the moduli space of a given multi-pronged string with xed d-brane positions is dened
by the solution space of the above bps equation modulo gauge transformation with xed
vacuum expectation values of scalars and electric/magnetic charges.

the tangent vectors of the moduli space with the gauge a0 = x, will satisfy the zero-

mode equation

ijkdjak  d4ai + dia4  i
dmdma0 + 2i[dma0, am] = 0 ,
dmam = 0 ,

mndman = 0 ,

where we introduced a notation i[a4, ()]  d4() and the t hooft symbol

(23)

a

mn =

amn , m, n = 1, 2, 3 ,
an , m = 4 ,
am , n = 4 ,
0,

m = n = 4 ,

and eq. (22) is the gauge condition. the zero modes are then normalizable solutions of the
above equations with a norm,

||a||2 =z d3x (a0a0 + amam) .

5

(24)

the number of the zero modes will agree with the dimensions of the moduli space or the
tangent space at a given point of the moduli space. in dealing with the above zero-mode
equations, we note that a multi-pronged string of su(n) can be always embedded into the
su(n ) theory with a larger n. then in the su(n ) theory, the eld components of the multi-
pronged solution other than the su(n) component are zero by construction. then with
this background solution, the uctuations of components other than the su(n) component
will be dynamically decoupled in the above zero-mode equations and, hence, can be trivially
set to vanish from the beginning. hereafter, we shall choose such an su(n) subgroup with
the minimum rank, where one can embed the pronged string, and work within such su(n).

this n is then the number of d-branes where the prongs end, which will be denoted by fn.

to expose the structure of the low-energy eective lagrangian resulted from the
moduli-space approximation,
let us suppose the zero modes are given by sa (s =
1, 2,    , #zeromode). let us further denote the moduli-space element as a(r; ) with
s being the coordinate of the moduli space.

inserting the solutions to the lagrangian with time-dependent moduli-coordinates, one

nds that

le =

1
2g2

ymz d3x trh a0 a0 + am am  2i(a0 ai)i ,

(25)

where we have used the gauge condition a0 = x and have dropped a constant term. the
eective lagrangian may be rewritten, to the quadratic order in velocities, as

le =

1
2

gss() s s

 as() s ,

with an appropriate gauge transformation,

a  s(sa  ds)  ssa ,

(26)

(27)

that insures the gauge condition (22) of the zero mode. the metric and the vector potential
can be expressed, in terms of the zero mode:

gss() =

as() =

1

ymz d3x tr [sa0sa0 + samsam] ,
ymzr=

dsi tra0sai =z d hi

pei lim

rhr2tr(cid:16)risaihp(cid:17)i ,

(28)

(29)

where, in the last equation, we have used the normalizability condition sai = o(1/r2) for
a large r. the vector potential term in eq. (26) is in fact a total time derivative term. this
can be easily seen from the last term of eq. (25), where a0 can be replaced by its asymptotic
value. although this total time derivative term does not aect the classical dynamics of the
moduli space, it is relevant in its quantum version especially when some of the directions of
the moduli space are compact. the motion in these compact directions is indeed involved
with the quantization of the electric charges.

iii. counting the number of zero modes

the equations of the bosonic zero modes and the gauge xing condition are given by
eqs. (20), (21) and (22). in this section we shall analyze the number of the normalizable
solutions of these equations. here and below, all vector potential and the covariant derivative
denote, respectively, the background solutions of pronged strings and the covariant derivative
with respect to the background. the normalizable solutions of eqs. (20) and (22) are the
zero modes of a bps monopole. the problem here is whether the equation (21) gives a
normalizable solution for a0 or not. as discussed in appendix (a), the condition that the
solution of eq. (21) be normalizable is given by

z d3x tr (a [dma0, am]) = 0 ,

(30)

where the trace is over the color indices and a (a = 1,    ,fn 1) are the zero modes of

the operator dmdm. from the junction bps equation, dmdma0 = dmdma4 = 0 holds.
they are independent for a 1/4 bps state, and hence they are two of a. as shown in
appendix (a), the conditions (30) are equivalent to the condition that the electric charges
should not change under the innitesimal changes of the conguration.

apparently these conditions seem to give fn  1 conditions on the tangent moduli space

of the monopole, but this is not. in fact, one of the conditions

z d3x tr(a4[dma0, am]) = 0

equations for the fermionic zero modes are given by

mdm

d()() =  2d0  
d(+)(+) =  0

0 ! () = 0 ,
mdm 2d0 ! (+) = 0 ,

 +
mdm

 
mdm

 +

7

is satised for any monopole zero mode am. to show this, we can use an identity resulting
from the simple fact that the magnetic charges do not change under the innitesimal change.
as shown in appendix (a), this implies that

z d3x tr(a0[dma4, am]) = 0 .

(32)

one can easily show that the partial integration of this equation gives eq. (31). (alter-
natively, one may understand eq. (31) in terms of the torque balance identity (13) by
tr[a4(r = ) qe] = tr[a0(r = ) qm ] and qm = 0.) hence the number of the con-

equations is given by #monopole  4 [11], where #monopole is the total number of the fun-

straints is in fact fn  2. the number of the bosonic zero modes of the monopole bps
damental monopoles, pa ma (see eq. (19)). therefore, taking into account the constraints,

the total number of the bosonic zero modes (bzm) of the junction solution is given by

let us now discuss the number of the fermionic zero modes of the junction solution. the

#bzm = #monopole  4  fn + 2 .

(31)

(35)

where d0 is understood as d0() = i[a0, ()] and the 2  2 matrices is dened by  
(i, i) and  +
decompose it by

m =

(38)

mdm has no zero modes, the solution is given by that (+)

since the operator

number3 of the fermionic zero modes resulting from eq. (35) is given by #monopole  4.
with a similar decomposition to two-component spinors, eq. (34) can be rewritten as

mdm()
 

(39)

(40)

the equation (39) just gives the fermionic zero modes of a bps monopole and the number
of the solutions is 4  #monopole. let us discuss the normalizability of ()
resulting from
eq. (40). first act an operator  +

mdm on eq. (40)4. using the bps equation, we obtain

(41)

this equation looks very similar to the bosonic one (21). to obtain a normalizable solution
of ()

, the following constraints on ()

1 must be satised:

2

where the trace is over the color indices. as similar to the bosonic case, one of the constraints,

is identically satised by the monopole fermionic zero modes.

to show this, let us start with eq. (39). applying the operator  

(dmdm + ia
 in the denition (23)). using further the bps equations, we obtain

1 = 0 (the symbols a

mdm on it, one obtains

hence the normalizability of the fermionic zero mode ()

(44)

3we count the number in real component. hence  and i are counted as distinct solutions.

4the following discussions are obscured by the existence of the zero modes of the operator  +
mdm.
however, using the explicit known relations between the fermionic and bosonic zero modes of a
monopole, one can show the same result given below. n.s. would like to thank s. imai for clarifying
this point.

by the partial integration of eq. (45) with the substitution a = a0, we obtain eq. (43).

thus the constraints (42) give 4(fn  2) constraints on the fermionic bps zero modes.

thus the total number of the fermionic zero modes (fzm) is given by

(45)

(46)

#fzm = #monopole  8  4(fn  2) .

in the next section, we will compare the numbers of the zero modes, eqs. (33) and (46),
with those derived from the type iib description.

finally we mention the reason why we should take fn instead of n in our formulae for

the numbers of the zero modes. let us consider a d-string of su(3) theory in fig. 1. the
zero mode equations take the same form as eqs. (20), (21) and (22) with dma0 = 0. hence
the solution of eq. (21) is simply a0 = 0. the others possess 2  4 zero-modes because the
d-string is regarded as two fundamental monopoles in eqs. (20) and (22). this is incorrect
because we know from the beginning, there are only four moduli degrees of freedom around
this conguration. this failure of the zero modes analysis may be understood as follows.
around the d-string conguration, the eld-theoretic potential is too at to capture the
correct number of zero modes by just considering the linearized uctuations of eqs. (20),
(21) and (22). the higher order analysis will show that the the relative motions of the
two fundamental monopoles drops out of the moduli space, which leaves just four overall
translation degrees.

however, our formula, eqs. (33) and (46), for the zero modes are still valid for the

d-string because we are using the minimal embedding of solutions and, hence, fn = 2.

iv. comparison with iib string theory

our result of the number of the bosonic zero modes does not agree with that from the iib
string theory. to illustrate, let us consider the simplest case of a tree three-pronged string

9

with two-form charges (1,0), (0,1) and (1, 1). the magnetic charge of the corresponding
eld theory solution in su(3) is (m1, m2) = (1, 1). thus the magnetic part has two funda-
mental monopoles, and the result (33) tells that there are seven bosonic zero modes. this
number looks quite odd, and moreover this does not agree with the iib result that is just
three for the present case [12]. however this is a very natural result from the explicit junc-
tion solution discussed in ref. [6]. their solution is composed of two monopole cores which
are surrounded by clouds of w-bosons, i.e. electric charges. the monopole part has eight
bosonic zero modes which are composed of the zero modes associated to three translations,
two gauge, two relative orientations, and one relative distance. the electric part is deter-
mined by the monopole part when the vacuum expectation values of the scalar elds take
given xed values. especially, the electric charges of the junction solution are determined
by the relative distance, while the magnetic charges are just topological numbers and stable.
since the electric charges appear in the asymptotic 1/r behavior of the junction solution,
the change of the relative distance is not normalizable. thus we should keep the relative
distance xed. the other monopole zero modes are naturally expected to be normalizable,
and hence there are seven bosonic zero modes in the junction solution.

on the other hand, we nd a nice agreement for the fermionic part. let us consider

a monopole conguration with magnetic charges (m1, m2,    , men 1). the corresponding
string conguration is such that fn d3-branes are aligned on a line and that the a-th and
the (a+1)-th d3-brane are connected by ma d-strings (a = 1,    ,fn 1). this conguration

may be regarded as the string conguration corresponding to a junction solution in the limit
of vanishing electric charges. to recover from the limit, let us now add small ns-ns charges
on each string. we do not take care of the quantization of the ns-ns charges, since our
treatment in the eld theory is just classical and does not care about the quantization of the
electric charges. then the conguration of the string is deformed, for example, to the one
in fig. 2, where there are ma  1 internal loops between the a-th and (a + 1)-th d3-branes.
although the diagram changes if the assignment of the small ns-ns charges is changed, the
number of loops do not change. the total number of the loops in the diagram is given by

en 1xa=1
(ma  1) = #monopole  (fn  1) .

(47)

fig. 2. the conguration of pronged strings ending on d3-branes which corresponds to our
eld theory analysis. the long strings have r-r charge one and small ns-ns charges. the gure
is for magnetic charges (m1, m2, m3) = (1, 3, 2) in su (4) case.

the zero mode analysis in the iib framework was done in ref. [12]. the result is

#fzm(iib) = 8fint + 4eext ,

(48)

10

where fint denotes the number of internal loops (faces) of the string diagram and eext is the
number of the external strings. thus, applying to the present case, we obtain

(49)

#fzm(iib) = 8(cid:16)#monopole  (fn  1)(cid:17) + 4fn = #monopole  8  4fn + 8 ,

which agrees with eq. (46).

finally, the discrepancy of the bosonic zero modes from the iib string picture might be

understood as follows. the expression (33) of the bosonic zero modes can be written as

#bzm =(cid:16)2(#monopole  1) + #monopole(cid:17) + #bzm(iib) ,

where the last term is the iib result [12],

#bzm(iib) = fint + 3 .

(50)

(51)

it is intriguing to note that the discrepancy (50) agrees with the number of the compact
directions of the monopole moduli space, i.e. there are 2(#monopole  1) relative spatial
orientations among the fundamental monopoles and one u(1) gauge direction per each fun-
damental monopole.
it might be expected that, when the junction bps state is treated
quantum mechanically, the wave function prevails the compact directions and these direc-
tions do not appear as the moduli of the state.

v. conclusion

in this paper, we nonperturbatively identied the numbers of the bosonic and fermionic
zero modes of the multi-pronged strings in the context of the n = 4 super-yang-mills theory.
the bosonic zero modes dier from the iib string picture, but the fermionic zero modes are
matching with those in the iib string picture.

the discrepancy is due to the softness of the eld-theoretic congurations. namely the
monopoles of the multi-pronged strings in the eld theory can take a relative motion in the
parallel space of the d3-branes, whereas the corresponding degrees in the iib picture cannot
be permitted. in the case of the minimal three-pronged strings, the number of bosonic zero
modes are seven while there are twelve fermionic zero modes. on the ground of the remaining
supersymmetries of the system, the natural number of bosonic degrees would be even due
to the complex structure of the remaining supersymmetry. we expect that the analysis of
detailed moduli dynamics may be helpful in resolving this issue. the comparison with the
m-theory result [13] or the d-string worldsheet approach [14] would also be interesting.

the dynamics of the moduli space is in itself of importance, especially in related with
the quantizations of the electric charges. the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of the
moduli space has been constructed in case of monopoles [15,16]. our work can be used in the
identication of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics for the multi-pronged strings. as is
also done for the monopoles and dyons [17], the response analysis of the multi-pronged strings
to the excitations of unbroken gauge elds will clarify most of leading physical processes
around the multi-pronged strings. these require further studies.

appendix a: the normalizability condition

in this appendix, we will show that the condition of getting a normalizable a0 from eq.

(21) is given by eq. (30).

to simplify the expressions, we take a gauge where the vacuum expectation value of a4
is expressed in a diagonal form5. we assume also that the diagonal entries take general
distinct values. then, since the massless elds are associated only to the diagonal entries,
the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to the equation dmdma = 0 should take the form

a = h(0)

a +

h(1)
a
r

+ o(cid:18) 1
r2(cid:19) ,

(a1)

a

where h(0,1)

(a = 1,    ,fn  1), and that the h(0)

are diagonal matrices. we assume that there are fn 1 solutions to this equation

span the cartan subalgebra6. note that a includes
a0 and a4, and we denote 1 = a0 and 2 = a4. the diagonal entries of the h(1)
1 are the
electric charges of the junction solution, while those of h(1)
2 are the magnetic charges. since
the vacuum expectation values are xed, the innitesimal changes caused by the changes of
the moduli parameters of a monopole should be in the form

a

a0 =

h(1)
1
r

r2(cid:19) ,
+ o(cid:18) 1

a4 =

h(1)
2
r

r2(cid:19) .
+ o(cid:18) 1

(a2)

since the magnetic charges are topological and do not change, am = o(1/r2). we dene
generalized electric central charges by

qe

a zr=

dsi tr(aei) =zr=

dsi tr(adia0) = tr(cid:16)h(0)

a h(1)

1 (cid:17) .

(a3)

under the assumption that the h(0)
span the cartan subalgebra, the invariance of the electric
a
charges is equivalent to the invariance of these central charges. since h(0)
is xed in the zero-
a
mode analysis, the deformation of these central charges by the presence of the zero modes
is

qe

a =zr=

dsi tr[a(dia0)] =z d3x tr [dma(dma0) + adm(dma0)] .

(a4)

using the above asymptotic behaviors together with a little further manipulation of eq.
(a4), one obtains

qe

a =z d3x tr[admdma0] = 2iz d3x tr(cid:16)a[dma0, am](cid:17) ,

(a5)

5we cannot take this gauge globally. in the following discussions, we just need to take this gauge
for a certain solid angle less than 4 outside a sphere of suciently large radius, since the solid
angle can be chosen arbitrary.

6this is explicitly shown for the solutions in [58].

13

where we have used eq. (21) for the last equality. similarly, dening

qm

a zr=

dsi tr(abi) =zr=

dsi tr(adia4) = tr(cid:16)h(0)

a h(1)

2 (cid:17) ,

the deformation by the zero mode can be expressed as

qm

a = 2iz d3x tr(cid:16)a[dma4, am](cid:17) ,

(a6)

(a7)

which is in fact automatically vanishing due to qm = 0 or h(1)

2 = 0. thus, recalling the

fact that there are fn  1 degrees of freedom of the electric charges and from eq. (21), the
to be normalizable under the measure r d3x tr(a0

equation (30) is equivalent to the condition that the electric charges do not change under the
innitesimally small changes of the monopole moduli. since the electric charges appear in
the asymptotic 1/r behavior of a0, this is a necessary condition for the innitesimal change
2). this necessary condition becomes a
sucient condition if the order next to 1/r is 1/r2 as in the expansion (a1) and (a2). in
the spherically symmetric solution discussed in refs. [5,7,8], the next order is exponentially
damping. in general non-spherical cases [6], the next order is expected to behave as 1/r2
from dipole contributions.

there is another way to see the condition (30). since the operator dmdm is a semi
positive denite hermitian operator, one may expand a0 in terms of the eigenfunctions.
the equation (21) is now

p c(p ; )  2iz d3x tr(f (p ; )[dma0, am]) = 0,

(a8)

where f (p ; ) denotes the eigenfunction with eigenvalue p with  parameterizing the
degeneracies of the eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue, and a0 is expanded as

pp, c(p ; )f (p ; ). if the second term of eq. (a8) is non-zero at p = 0, the c(p ; ) will

behave in 1/p near p = 0 (we assume that the eigenvalues of the operator dmdm exist
continuously around p = 0). this behavior may violate the normalizability. therefore the
condition that the second term vanishes for p  0 is related to the normalizability. this
is the condition (30). but to conclude this we need the measure near p = 0 from more
knowledge on the spectrum of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors.
