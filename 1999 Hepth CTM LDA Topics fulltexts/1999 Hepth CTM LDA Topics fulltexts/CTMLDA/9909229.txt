(2.22) classical zero v p 6= 0 must f = df = 0. hence, hypersurface k smooth, zero energy states p = 0. space states hypersurface k obtained setting f = 0 cn+1. thus, smooth k, model ow infrared sigma model target space k. far discussion rather like (0, 2) case. suppose k singular. setting singular point k, solution (2.15), get new branch moduli space vacua taking p 6= 0. new branch compact, since p arbitrarily big. ability quantum states spread new branch expected lead breakdown conformal eld theory. indeed, case conifold (for n = 3), familiar pole yukawa couplings computed {$9505162$} leaking quantum states onto new branch. computation actually done linear sigma model realization conifold dierent given above; fact dierent linear sigma model formulations show occurrence new branch singularity encourages us believe intrinsic phenomenon singularity artifact particular linear sigma model formulation. comparison bundle singularities opposite situation looked singularity gauge bundle smooth manifold. argued ({$9505162$}, section 5.1) large class linear sigma models, gauge singularity smooth manifold result breakdown conformal eld theory. particular case (in complex dimension three) proposal made concerning nature resulting nonperturbative physics {$9505162$}. results generalize small instanton story n = 2. conformal eld theory break singularity, nature breakdown fully understood. known cases, including small instanton , type ii a-d-e singularities {$9505162$}, several cases treated recently {$9505162$}, breakdown conformal eld theory apparently described appearance, suitable change variables, linear dilaton eld blowup string coupling constant one end. framework understanding proposed {$9505162$}. appendix . structure (0, 2) moduli space let calabi-yau threefold; keep complex structure xed discussion. remaining moduli (0, 2) supersymmetric model target gauge bundle 19 moduli kahler moduli. denition holomorphic vector bundle depends complex structure kahler metric. one might therefore think supergravity approximation, (0, 2) moduli space would product mg mk gauge bundle moduli space mg kahler moduli space mk. assumed section 5.2 {$9505162$}, inaccurate several reasons.
