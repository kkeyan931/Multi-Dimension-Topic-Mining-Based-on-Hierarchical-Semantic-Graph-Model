abstract

a scattering description is proposed for a boundary perturbation of a c = 1
sl(2, z) invariant conformal eld theory. the bulk massless s-matrices are
of the form of zamolodchikovs staircase model. using the boundary version
of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz, we show that the boundary free energy
goes through a series of integer valued plateaux as a function of system size.

i. introduction

a simple model was recently proposed in connection with quantum hall plateaux transi-
tions [1]. after bosonization, the model consists of a scalar eld coupled to a pure gauge eld
with a boundary interaction incorporating a circular defect line of impurities. the c = 1
conformal eld theory possesses an sl(2, zz) symmetry. though the precise connection with
the complete landau problem in the presence of disorder is not entirely clear, the model
does have some promising features, and we continue to investigate it in this paper.

in the next section an exact s-matrix description of the theory is proposed. we cannot
claim to give here an absolute derivation of this s-matrix since we are missing a more precise
treatment of the zero-mode constraint (eq. (3)). rather we give a suggestive derivation
based on the prescriptive treatment described in [1].

the proposed scattering description allows an exact computation of the boundary (im-
it reveals an innite series of plateaux at

purity) contribution to the free energy, log g.
integer values of g.

ii. s-matrices

let us rst summarize some of the features of the model described in [1]. the conformal

eld theory was dened by the euclidean action

s =z dtd  1

where a is the electro-magnetic gauge eld. the above theory lives on a cylinder with
0 <  < 2, and in the folded boundary version which we consider here, 0 < t < . the
lagrangian possesses the gauge symmetry

where e = i . the gauge eld was taken to be a pure, singular gauge a = ,

and the theory was supplemented by the zero mode constraint

when xx = 0, the parameter  was related to the hall conductivity as xy = 1/.

the pure gauge eld can be gauged away using

using the zero mode constraint eq. (3), this leads us to consider the gauge transformation

to a boundary term in the action r d cos(cid:16)e(0, )/2(cid:17), where the boundary is at t = 0.

performing the gauge transformation (5) led to the boundary eld theory

s = sbcf t + z d cos  b

bg2 !!

where b = 2. the boundary conformal eld theory sbcf t is that of a free scalar eld, but
with the unusual boundary condition [1]:

bg2  = 0,

(t = 0)

(7)

the above theory is massless in the bulk, but with a mass/length scale at the boundary.
to obtain an s-matrix description of this theory we follow the ideology described in [2].
namely, we imagine turning on an integrable bulk interaction such that the integrability is
not destroyed by the boundary interactions. this selects a special basis of particles in the
bulk that diagonalize the boundary interactions. we then take a massless limit in the bulk.
a bulk interaction that is compatible with the boundary interaction, as far as integrability

the boundary sine-gordon model, which is known to be integrable [3]. performing the same

goes, is sbulk = r dtd cos(be), where again b = 2. the reason is, that since ()2 =
(e)2, written in terms of e, the above theory, without the gauge eld, is equivalent to
gauge transformation eq. (5) leads us to consider sbulk = r dtd cos b(e + /bg2).
next consider the boundary condition eq. (7). using t = t = 1, one has i = te.

thus the boundary condition can be written as

(t = 0)

(8)



t  

bg2 e! = 0,
8    b
2 e!!2

this is a neumann boundary condition for the combination   e/bg2. all of this leads

us to consider the bulk theory

sbulk =z dtd

+  cos2 e + b

theory leads to the boundary condition (8).

where we have dened b = 2/bg2. when  = 0, the boundary version of the above free
let us now rewrite the theory in terms of e. as far as the bulk theory is concerned, we
can drop the topological term e, since it is identically zero. using (e)2 = ()2,
and dening a rescaled eld e  ie/q1  (b/2)2, one nds

sbulk =z dtd(cid:18) 1

(e)2 +  cosh (blel + brer)(cid:19)

where we have used the left-right decompositions  = l + r, e = l  r, and

(11)

when bl = br, the above bulk theory is the well-known sinh-gordon model. consider
now the massless limit   0. the theory has both left and right moving particles. for the
right-movers we parameterize the energy and momentum by e = p = e, and for the left
movers e = p = e, where  is a rapidity and  an arbitrary energy scale. one can
describe the theory in terms of an s-matrix sll() for the left-movers and srr() for the
right-movers [4]. from the form of the bulk interaction in eq. (10) it is clear that sll is
the sinh-gordon s-matrix dened by the sinh-gordon coupling bl, whereas srr is dened
by br. one argument is the following.
in the sine-gordon version, one can characterize
the s-matrices by the non-local quantum ane symmetry [5]. this symmetry survives in
the massless limit, and the left-moving (right-moving) quantum ane symmetry will have
q-deformation parameter dened by bl (br). using the known s-matrix for the sinh-gordon
model [6], the result is thus

where

sll() =

tanh 1

similarly, srr is given by eq. (12) with

(14)

using the invariance of the s-matrix under   1  , one sees that sll = srr.
we discuss now the sl(2, zz) properties of the above s-matrix. as described in [1], the
bulk conformal eld theory has an sl(2, zz) invariance acting on the modular parameter

 = /2 + ibg2/2. more specically, the partition function on the torus is invariant under
sl(2, zz). since sll, srr provide a scattering description of this conformal eld theory, we
expect the s-matrix to be at least in part characterized by this symmetry. under   1/ ,
one has that (bg, )  (bg, ) where
bg2

note that under this transformation, /bg2  /bg2, which implies b  b. thus   1/

simply exchanges left and right movers:

  1/ = b2

l  b2

(16)

since sll = srr, the scattering theory has this invariance.

the other independent generator of sl(2, zz) corresponds to    + 1, which corre-
sponds to    + 2. the s-matrices turn out to only be invariant under a multiple of

(bg4/4 + (/2)2)

this transformation. namely, using the invariance of the s-matrices under    + 2, one
veries their invariance under    + 4bg2. for the original fermion model considered in
[1] with bg = 2 this corresponds to    + 8. the signicance of this is not entirely clear.
we now consider performing the analytic continuation   i. there are at least two
justications for doing this. first, the hall conductivity computed in [1] is imaginary un-
less one performs this continuation. second, in order to formulate the above scattering
description one needs to have identied a time by continuing to minkowski space. let
us analytically continue to minkowski space by identifying  as the time (based on the
boundary interaction) and letting   i. the minkowski action sm is obtained from the
euclidean one by sm = is(  i). this leads to the analytic continuation of   i. to
see this, let us rescale   . then the euclidean topological term is

stop  iz dtd(t  t)

(17)

letting   i and identifying sm as above one nds that the minkowski action is obtained
by the analytic continuation   i. performing this continuation in eq. (11) one nds
that br = b

l, blbr = 2 and that the s-matrices now have the parameters:

l =

1
2

+ i b

,

r =  
l

(18)

the resulting s-matrix has the same form as the bulk massive staircase model of zamolod-
chikov [7], where there  was taken as  = 1/2  i0/. however since we are here dealing
with a massless bulk theory, the interpretation is dierent and in fact our theory doesnt suf-
fer from some of the problems of interpretation of the bulk massive staircase model. namely,
since there is no bulk interaction in the massless limit, just a free scalar eld, the theory
doesnt have the reality problems of the massive case arising from complex values of the
sinh-gordon coupling b. the above scattering theory is a limiting case of the bulk massive
theories studied in [8].

finally, the interactions at the boundary are described by a reection s-matrix r()
for reection of the above particles o the boundary. in the massless sinh-gordon model,
this reection s-matrix, which can be obtained by taking the explicit massless limit of the
boundary sinh-gordon model, is known to be independent of the sinh-gordon coupling bl.
(see [9]). the result should be the same in our case and we thus take

r() = tanh(/2  i/4)

(19)

the physical s-matrix for right movers is r(  b), and for left movers r( + b), where
eb is dened as a physical boundary energy scale.

iii. plateaux transitions in the boundary entropy

we consider now the theory on a semi-innite cylinder of circumference l, where  runs
along the circumference and    + l and as before 0 < t < . viewing  as the
time, the hilbert space lives on the semi-innite line 0 < t < , and nite size l eects

can be computed from the l-channel thermodynamic bethe ansatz [10] [11]. of interest
is the boundary entropy log g [12], dened as the contribution to the free energy that is
independent of the length r of the cylinder, log z = log g + log zbulk, where log zbulk is
proportional to r. viewing the theory as a 1 + 1 dimensional quantum system, g represents
the ground state degeneracy, i.e. it counts the number of states at the boundary.

using the formulas in [11], one has

log g =

1

2iz 



d [ log r()]

log(cid:16)1 + e()(cid:17)

where () is a solution of the integral equation

() =

l
2b

e 

1

2iz d  [ log sll(   )] log(cid:16)1 + e( )(cid:17)

(20)

(21)

in the above equation, b is a boundary length scale 1/b = eb; it denes an energy scale
at the boundary eb = 1/b.

200, 100 in gures 1 and 2. there are two important features of these gures. the rst is
that on the plateaux g takes on the series of integers g = 1, 2, 3, .., as anticipated in [8]. the

the numerical solution of g as a function of b/l is shown for the two values of b =
second is that the plateaux are more clearly dened as b is increased.

iv. discussion

we conclude with a discussion of the possible implications of our results for the proposal
made in [1] in connection with the quantum hall transitions. the integer valued plateaux
that we found in the boundary state degeneracy is a promising feature. the meaning of the
boundary entropy suggests that as the scale l is decreased, the model goes through a series
of transitions where at each transition one more state becomes localized at the impurities.
in order to verify this picture one needs to relate the boundary entropy of our 2-dimensional
model to the 2 + 1 dimensional system.

in this paper since we have not studied the conductivities xx, xy. in the conformal eld

the signicance of b = , as discussed in [1], cannot be seen from what we have done
theory it was argued that b =  implies xx = 0, xy = 1/. one needs to study the

conductivities in the presence of the boundary interaction. it should be possible to do this
using form factors. since the conductivities are reduced to boundary eects, it seems likely
that the transitions in the boundary entropy will entail transitions in the conductivity, but
only a detailed analysis will tell.

a related issue which needs clarication concerns whether the scattering theory described
here implicitly treats the boundary condition in a way that is consistent with the perturbative

treatment in [1], which, when b = , led to the correlation length exponent 20/9.
