abstract

we study possible relations between the full greens functions of softly broken
supersymmetric theories and the full greens functions of rigid supersymmetric
theories on the example of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics and nd that
algebraic relations can exist and can be written in a simple form. these algebraic
relations between the greens functions have been derived by transforming the
path integral of the rigid theory. in this approach soft terms appear as the result
of general changes of coordinates in the superspace.

the renormalization of softly broken supersymmetric yang-mills theories in four
space-time dimensions into the framework of the supereld technique and spurions
method was studied from dierent points of view in refs. ([1]-[6]). the soft terms
were introduced as the nite series in terms of grassmanian coordinates of the su-
perspace. it results in dependence of renormalization constants of the theory on the
grassmanian coordinates. as it was understood, there are direct relations between the
renormalization constants of the rigid theory  theory without soft terms  and the
renormalization constants of its softly broken counterpart. the rst investigation in
this direction was performed by yamada [1] and it was developed in [4, 5], where simple
rules to calculate these constants starting from the well-known results for the rigid the-
ory have been derived. these rules are realized in terms of dierential operators acting
in the coupling space of the rigid theory. in the ref.[5] it was found that this approach
is in good agreement with nonperturbative results [2]. the reason why these rules
exist is that the soft breaking terms can be considered as background x-independent
superelds [5, 6] in which our theory is embedded. these external superelds must
be substituted into innite parts of the greens functions instead of the couplings of
the rigid theory. the algebraic relations between the renormalizations constants are
consequences of these substitutions [5].

however, it would be nice to have relations for the complete greens functions of
the theory that includes soft terms and for its counterpart without them. here we nd
these relations for the case of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics as a simplest
example where the method proposed below can work. the supersymmetric quantum
mechanics was developed in ([7]-[9]) and its action is 2

sr = z dxdd(cid:16)d d + v ()(cid:17) ,

where v is an arbitrary function of the real supereld ,

(1)

(cid:16)x, , (cid:17) = (x) + i(x) + i (x) +  d(x),  = .

the lagrangian (1) is the only thing of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics
we need. in the rest of this letter we work with the path integral produced by this
classical action. the greens functions of it are referred in what follows as the rigid
greens functions:

gr

n (cid:16)x1, x2, . . . , xn, 1, . . . , n, 1, . . . , n(cid:17) =







. . .

j(x1, 1, n)

j(x2, 1, 1)

j(xn, n, n)

z r[j]|j =0,

z r[j] = z d exp(cid:18)sr +z dxddj(cid:19).

some comments about this expression are necessary. the greens functions are local in
the grassmanian -coordinates [10]. this result can be seen in the perturbation theory

2here the superscript r stands for rigid

1

after performing the grassmanian integration. however, we would like to keep all the
grassmanian coordinates in the above expression since all the following speculations
are based on the path integral only. the external source j is also real supereld,
j  = j. the covariant derivatives in the action (1) are dened as

d =



  i


x

,

d =


 

+ i


x

.

polynomials in grassmanian coordinates which are background x-independent super-
elds can stand in front of the terms of the action (1),

ss = z dxdd(cid:16)p1(, )d d + p2(, )v ()(cid:17),

pi(, ) = i + ii + i i  + i , p 

i = pi.

(2)

here i, i, and i are arbitrary numbers, i is grassmanian.
in this case we say
that there is a soft supersymmetry breaking since if we do not transform charges in a
proper way we have non-invariance of the component action under the supersymmetry
transformations caused by the change of the coordinates in the superspace

our purpose is to show a way in which the rigid greens functions and the soft greens
functions,

j(xn, n, n)

z s[j]|j =0,

z s[j] = z d exp(cid:18)ss +z dxddj(cid:19),

can be related. first of all, let us suppose that a general change of the superspace
coordinates is made,

x = x(x, ,

),

 = (x, ,

),

 = (x, ,

),

and we look for changes which satisfy the conditions

d(cid:16)x  i

(cid:17) = 0, d(cid:16)x + i

(cid:17) = 0,

d  = 0, d

 = 0,

x = x,

(4)

(5)

where we suppose that we know the reversed law of the transformation (4)

x = x(x, , ),

 = (x, , ),

 = (x, , ).

2

the conditions (5) mean that the covariant derivative transforms as

d =



  i



x  (cid:16)d (cid:17)  

   i



 x! ,

(6)

and d transforms in the hermitian conjugated way. the most general change of
superspace coordinates that satisfy the condition (5) is

x = g(x) + if (x)qg(x) + if (x)qg(x)  f 2(x) 

 = qg(x  i ) + f (x  i )
 = qg(x + i ) + f (x + i ),

(7)

where the functions f and g are arbitrary and  is a grassmanian dimensionful con-
stant. the berezinian of this change of coordinates is a long expression and we do not
write it here for the brevity. nevertheless, it is possible to see already in the law (7)
that the ( =  = 0)-component of the berezinian is equal to 1 for any functions f and
g. at the same time the factors d  and d arising in (6) under the change of coordi-
nates in front of the covariant derivatives in the kynetic term of the rigid action sr has
the g as its ( =  = 0)-component. therefore, in order to have the independent
on the space coordinate factor after the change is made we should take g(x) = x and
keep f (x) arbitrary for a moment. then the form of the above transformation is

x = x + if (x) + if (x)  f 2(x) 

 =  + f (x  i )
 =  + f (x + i ).

the change of coordinates reversed to (8) is

x = x  if (x)  i


f (x)  f 2(x)
)
 =  (1 + if 2(x))  f (x  i
).
 (1  if 2(x))  f (x + i
 =

(8)

(9)

by the explicit calculation we see that the berezinian of this change is equal to 1 for
any function f. to have a common factor arising in (6) as x-independent background
supereld, we should choose f (x) = x. in this case, the transformation (8) is

x = x(cid:16)1 + i + i  2 (cid:17) = x(cid:16)1  i  i(cid:17)1

 =  + (x  i )
 =  + (x + i ),

and the reversed transformation is

x = x(cid:16)1 + i + i(cid:17)1
)(cid:17) exp(2i)
).
)(cid:17) exp(2i

 = (cid:16)  (x  i
 = (cid:16)  (x + i

the factors d  and d

 that come from (6) are

d  = exp(cid:16)2i(cid:17) = exp(cid:16)2i[
d = exp (2i) = exp(cid:16)2i[  (x  i)](cid:17) .

  (x + i

(12)

(13)

therefore, the common factor that is due to the transformation of the derivatives (6)
is

d  d = exp(cid:16)2i + 2i + 4(cid:17) = 1 + 2i + 2i

we can make the change of coordinates (11) in the rigid action sr of the path

integral z r:

z r[j] = z d exp(cid:18)z dxdd[d d + v () + j](cid:19) =

= z d  exp(cid:18)z dxdd[(1 + 2i + 2i)d  d  + v ( ) + j ](cid:19) = z s[ j],

(14)

where the denitions are used:

(x, , ) =

, (cid:16)  (x  i )(cid:17) e2i , (cid:16)  (x + i )(cid:17) e2i ! .

as one can see the second part of (14) is the path integral of the theory with soft

supersymmetry breaking terms that correspond according to (2) to

p1(, ) = 1 + 2i + 2i, p2(, ) = 1

(15)

we can expand this soft path integral z s in terms of the external source j and the
coecient functions of this expansion are in fact the greens functions of the soft theory

z s[ j] = xn z dx1dx2 . . . dxnd1 . . . dnd1 . . . dn

(16)

now we can make the change of coordinates back and restore the original sources j.
it means that by changing the coordinates in the superspace as in (10) for each of xi
we have instead of (16) the expression

as one can see from (14), the expansion (17) is at the same time the expansion of
the z r[j] in terms of the external source of the rigid theory j. therefore, the following
equality takes place

gr

n (cid:16)x1, x2, . . . , xn, 1, 2, . . . , n, 1, 2, . . . , n(cid:17) =

(18)

having used the substitutions (11) we transform the equation (18) to the form

gs

n(cid:16)x1, x2, . . . , xn, 1, 2, . . . , n, 1, 2, . . . , n(cid:17) =

. . . , (cid:16)n  (xn + in n)(cid:17) e2i n(cid:17) .

(19)

thus, the nal result is that the theory with soft supersymmetry breaking terms
(2) in the form (15) is equivalent to the rigid theory (1) in the sense of the relation
(19) between their greens functions. it looks like something surprising that we could
relate soft and rigid theories, but the explanation is if we amount couplings to back-
ground x-independent superelds we have their transformations at the level of the
component action which are the reection of the change of coordinates in the super-
space (3). hence, if we treat couplings of theory at the component level as components
of an external background multiplet, we have no supersymmetry breaking since we
include rigid couplings and soft couplings in the supersymmetry transformation (3).
nevertheless, we can create soft terms under general changes of the coordinates in the
superspace.
