abstract

we address the implementation of non-abelian wilson lines in d=4 n=1
type iib orientifold constructions. we present an explicit three-family exam-
ple with the gauge group (u(4)u(2)su(2)su(2))2(u(6)sp(4))2 and
give the particle spectrum and the trilinear superpotential. emphasizing
the new subtleties associated with the introduction of non-abelian wilson
lines, we show that the abelian gauge anomalies are cancelled by the green-
schwarz-type mechanism, and calculate the fayet-iliopoulos terms and gauge
coupling corrections. the analysis thus sets a stage for further investigations
of the phenomenological implications of this model.

i. introduction

four-dimensional n=1 supersymmetric type iib orientifolds [14] provide a domain of
perturbative string vacua whose study of physics implications is still at the early stages
of investigation [5,6].
in particular, there is the need to further explore the existence of
string vacua with quasi-realistic features, i.e., those with gauge group close to that of the
standard model and massless spectra with three families 1. in order to reduce the gauge
group structure, one mechanism involves the introduction of wilson lines [4,11]. (other
mechanisms involve for example the blowing-up procedure [12] or the introduction of non-
zero ns-ns two-form background elds [13].)

in particular, the introduction of wilson lines that do not commute with the discrete
orbifold symmetry seems to be a promising mechanism to reduce the gauge group structure
and lead us a step closer to the construction of quasi-realistic models [11]. we address the
consistent implementation of the symmetry actions of both the discrete orientifold group
and the wilson line actions. in addition, constraints arising from tadpole cancellation as
well as the requirement that the massless sector is free of non-abelian anomalies, severely
restrict the allowed solutions.

we focus on a particular three family z3  z2  z2 type iib orientifold model [11] (a
descendant of the z3-orientifold [1], the rst n=1 supersymmetric type iib orientifold with
three families and the gauge group u(12)so(8)). we address the possible wilson lines,
which necessarily commute with the z3 but not all the z2 orbifold actions. we nd that
the consistency conditions (the absence of tadpoles and non-abelian gauge anomalies) allow
for a very limited number of possible models. we focus on the (only) example with gauge
group structure that encompasses that of the standard model and present the massless
spectrum and the trilinear superpotential2 (see section ii). in section iii, we explicitly
demonstrate that the abelian gauge anomalies of the massless spectrum are cancelled by
a green-schwarz-type mechanism (proposed in [16] and conrmed in [18]); in particular,
we explore the additional subtleties that are associated with non-abelian wilson lines. in
section iv we derive the form of the fayet-iliopoulos (fi) terms as well as the corrections
to the gauge kinetic functions due to the blowing-up moduli. in section v we summarize
results and point out possible generalizations to address a general set-up for a consistent
construction of type iib orientifold solutions with non-abelian wilson lines. in appendix
a we derive the massless matter spectrum and in appendix b the moduli of z2 twisted
sectors.

1recent explorations involve the construction of type iib orientifolds with branes and anti-branes
which break supersymmetry, while keeping the models stable (tachyon-free [79]). a number of
quasi-realistic models were recently constructed in [10].

2the presented study builds on earlier work [11]. however, we nd a dierent gauge group and
massless spectrum.

ii. orientifold constructions

a. d = 4, n = 1 orientifolds

we compactify type iib theories on a six-torus t 6 and mod out a discrete symmetry
group g1 and the world-sheet parity operation , which could be accompanied by another
discrete symmetry g2, i.e. the orientifold group is g = g1 + g2. closure requires gg 
g1 for g, g  g2. in the following we always have g1 = g2.
the compactied tori are described by complex coordinates xi, i = 1, 2, 3. the action of
an orbifold group zn on the compactied dimensions can be summarized in a twist vector
v = (v1, v2, v3),

g : xi  e2ivixi ,

(1)

where the vis are multiples of 1
v1 + v2 + v3 = 1.

n . in our conventions, n = 1 supersymmetry requires that
since the  projection relates left- and right-movers, it gives rise to open strings [14].
tadpole cancellation then requires the inclusion of an even number of d9 branes and addi-
tional discrete symmetries in the orientifold group may require the presence of multiple sets
of d5 branes for consistency.

an open string state can be written as |, iji where  denotes the world-sheet state
and i, j the chan-paton states of the left and right end points on a d9 or d5 brane. the
elements g  g1 act on open string states as follows:

g : |, iji  (g)ii |g  , iji (1

g )j j .

similarly, the elements of g1 act as

g : |, iji  (g)ii |g  , jii (1

g )j j ,

(2)

(3)

where we have dened g = g, up to a phase, in accordance with the usual rules for
multiplication of group elements. note, that  exchanges the chan-paton indices. hence,
(g)2 acts as

(g)2 : |, iji  [g(1

g )t]ii(cid:12)(cid:12)(g)2  , ij(cid:11) [t

since the g form a projective representation of the orientifold group, consistency with
group multiplication implies some conditions on the g. consider the g1 = g2 = zn case.
if g is the generator of zn , we must have

g1

g ]j j .

(4)

analogously, 2 = 1 implies that

n
g = 1 .

 = t
 .

further, due to the closure relation gg  g1 for g, g  g2, one must have

g  .

(7)

it turns out that the tadpoles cancel, if we choose the plus sign for d9 branes and the minus
sign for d5 branes [4].

in the d9 brane sector  is symmetric and can be chosen real, while it is antisymmetric

in the d5 brane sectors and can be chosen imaginary there. hence, in a suitable basis

0 (cid:19)
,9 =(cid:18) 0 1116

1116

and

,5 =(cid:18) 0 i1116

0 (cid:19) ,

i1116

(8)

where the subscript 9 or 5 denotes the brane sector in which these matrices are acting.
hence, in both the d9 and d5 brane sectors eq. (7) yields

(k

g ) = k

g  .

(9)

further, niteness of string loop diagrams yields tadpole cancellation conditions which

constrain the traces of g matrices. for example, in the case of z3 [1]

t r(z3) = 4 .

(10)

open string states, whose chan-paton matrices will be denoted by (i), i = 0, . . . , 3 in
the following, give rise to space-time gauge bosons (i = 0) and matter states (i = 1, 2, 3).
gauge bosons in the d9 brane sector arise from open strings beginning and ending on d9
branes (the matter states will be discussed in appendix a). invariance of these states under
the action of the orientifold group requires

(0) = ,9(0)t

1
,9

and

(0) = g,9(0)1
g,9 .

(11)

with eq. (8) the rst constraint implies that the (0) are so(32) generators, while the
constraints from the g,9 will further reduce the group.

similarly, in the d5 brane sectors the chan-paton matrices of the gauge bosons satisfy

the following constraints:

(0) = ,5(0)t

1
,5

and

(0) = g,5i(0)1

g,5i .

(12)

due to the symplectic nature of ,5 in eq. (8), world-sheet parity yields sp(32) generators
for the gauge group, which will be further reduced by the additional orientifold actions.

let us now consider the z2  z2  z3 orientifold, rst constructed in ref. [11]. tadpole
cancellation implies that we have 32 d9 branes and three dierent sets of 32 d5 branes,
which we will distinguish by an index i. the d5i brane lls the 4-dimensional space-time
and the torus parametrized by xi. the z3 twist action on the tori is given by the twist
vector v = ( 1
3) and, both in the d9 brane and the d5i brane sectors, its action on
chan-paton matrices is generated by:

3, 1

3, 1

z3 = diag(cid:0)1112, 114, 11112, 114(cid:1) , where  = e2i/3 .

this choice satises eqs. (9) and (10).

(13)

the two z2s act on the compactied coordinates xi (i = 1, 2, 3) in the following way:

here, b1 is a general 6  6 matrix, corresponding to the adjoint representation of u(6). b2
is a general 2  2 matrix and s1 and s2 are symmetric 2  2 matrices, i.e. b2, s1 and s2
form an adjoint representation of sp(4).
in the d5i brane sectors, the chan-paton matrices for the gauge elds have a similar

structure, i.e. we get three additional copies of the gauge group u(6)sp(4).

b. wilson lines

in order to further break the gauge symmetry we introduce discrete wilson lines, which
can be written as a matrix w acting on the chan-paton matrices. a wilson line along the
two-torus xi has to satisfy the following algebraic consistency conditions

(z3w )3 = +1 ,

(cid:0)rj,9w(cid:1)2 = 1 ,

(cid:0)rj,5iw(cid:1)2 = +1

for j 6= i .

(23)

these conditions and eqs. (19) and (20) then imply that w and ri have to commute in
the d9 and d5i brane sectors,

[ri,9, w ] = 0 ,

[ri,5i, w ] = 0 .

(24)

this is due to the fact that ri does not act on the compactied coordinate xi (cf. eqs. (14)
and (15)). further, tadpole cancellation requires

tr (z3) = tr (z3w ) = tr(cid:0)z32
tr(cid:0)z3w rj ,s(cid:1) = tr(cid:0)z32

w(cid:1) = 4 ,
w rj,s(cid:1) = 0 ,

for s = 9 or 5i .

in the following we will restrict ourselves to the case of one wilson line along the third
two-torus.
it turns out that eqs. (23)(26) allow only one wilson line (up to equivalent
representations) which yields a gauge group containing the standard model as a subgroup:

w = diag(cid:0)w1, w2, w 1

, w3(cid:1) ,

(27)

(28)

since we place all the d5 branes at the origin, this wilson line acts only in the d9 and d53
brane sectors. the gauge bosons in these two sectors have to obey one additional constraint,

the generator b1 of the u(6) in eq. (22) therefore gets reduced to

(0) = w (0)1
w .

b1 =  b1 0

b2! ,

0

(29)

(30)

where b1 and b2 are general 2  2 and 4  4 matrices, respectively. hence, the u(6) gets
broken down to a u(4)u(2). similarly, the sp(4) generators b2 and si are reduced to

b2 =  w1 0

0 z1! ,

s1 =  w2 0

0 z2! ,

s2 =  w3 0

0 z3! .

(31)

here, the wi and zi generate two su(2)s.

in the 51 and 52 sectors the gauge groups remain unbroken. the action of wilson lines on
the matter states is discussed in appendix a and the resulting spectrum of the z3  z2  z2
model with one wilson line is given in table iii.

where summation over repeated indices is understood and we dened s(ij)  u (ji). further,
we have suppressed the actual yukawa couplings and determined only trilinear couplings.
note, that (s) and (s), the extra matter states from (3) in the 9 and 53 sectors (cf. appendix
a), do not have trilinear couplings.

3the nonzero terms in the superpotential are determined by gauge invariance and standard tech-
niques of superconformal eld theory in the closed superstring sector [15].

iii. chern-simons terms and anomaly cancellation

it is obvious from the spectrum that the u(1) factors in various sectors are anomalous at
the eective eld theory level. therefore, it is important to check that the abelian anomalies
cancel through the generalized green-schwarz mechanism [16].

before we demonstrate the cancellation of the u(1) anomalies explicitly, we turn to a
discussion of the ns-ns sector moduli elds of the z2  z2  z3 orientifold. there are three
untwisted sector moduli associated with the scaling deformation of each two-torus. if we
denote the complexied bosonic coordinate associated with the j th two-torus as x j , the
three moduli elds are represented by zx j z x j (j = 1, 2, 3) vertices.

the twisted sector moduli elds arise from dierent twisted sectors and are associated
with the xed points of the z2  z2  z3 orientifold. the twisted sectors are generated by
3 ), 2}), and the two z2s,
the multiplications of elements of z3 ({1,   diag(e
generated by r1 = diag(1,1,1) and r2 = diag(1, 1,1), respectively. each sector is
specied by a certain number of xed points (and/or xed two-tori). however, not all the
xed points in these sectors are in one-to-one correspondence with the physical states, such
as blowing-up moduli. generally, in each sector only particular combinations of blowing
up-modes that are invariant under the action of the remaining discrete rotations survive.

the blowing-up modes of the z3 twisted sectors can be identied in the following way.
the  sector has 27 = 3  3  3 xed points, and twisted elds j
i are associated with the
ith xed point (i = 1, 2, 3) of the j th two-torus t 2 (j = 1, 2, 3). the z3 orientifold would
have 27 blowing-up moduli elds of the form i,j,k  1
k, where (i, j, k) = {1, 2, 3} run
over the three xed points on each torus. however, the invariance of the states under the
two discrete z2-rotations r1 and r2 implies that only nine combinations of the original
blowing-up modes are physical. those are (a) the blowing-up mode at the origin, (b) three
blowing-up modes that are symmetric combinations of i,j,k with one of the indices being
2 and the other two indices xed to be 1 and its mirror image under z2 twists, (c) three
blowing-up modes with a symmetric combinations of i,j,k with two of the indices being
2 and the other index xed to be 1 and its three mirror images under z2 twists and (d)
two blowing-up modes which are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of i,j,k with
i = j = k = 2 and its ve images under z2 twists.

i 2

j 3

the 16 blowing-up modes of each of the ri twists are combined to generate 6 physical
moduli that are also invariant under the z3 action (cf. appendix b). the order 6 twists ri
(i = 1, 2, 3) each have two blowing-up moduli (r3  r1r2 = (1,1, 0)), which can be seen
as follows, using r3 as an example. the r3 rotation is generated by diag(e
3 ).
the order-6 twists in both the rst and second tori generate one xed point (at the origin
in each of the two-tori). the third torus has three xed points due to the order-three
twist. however, the r1 and r2 invariance selects out the two physical modes, 1,1,1 and
1,1,{2,3}  12
(1,1,2 + 1,1,3), which combines the two states that are mirror pairs under r1
and r2.

a. chern-simons terms

anomaly cancellation is ensured by the existence of the chern-simons (cs) term of the

eective theory [17], which is of the form

ics xk z d4x ck  ef ,

(33)

where ck are the 2-form ramond-ramond moduli elds arising from the kth twisted sector
and f is the eld strength of the gauge bosons. the rst order expansion in f gives the
term

xk z d4x ck  tr(k(0))f ,

(34)

where the coecient tr(k(0)) is associated to the orbifold action and the chan-paton
matrix of the gauge bosons. the second order expansion gives the coupling between the
twisted sector rr elds and f f , with the prefactor tr((k)1(0)2
). these two couplings
are responsible for the cancellation of eld theoretical u(1) anomalies [16].

the particular combinations of rr twisted sector elds that are responsible for u(1)
anomaly cancellations require careful study. for example, the explicit trace calculation for
the z2z2z3 orientifold without wilson line (table ii) reveals that tr(k(0)) vanishes for
all the twists except those of z3. it implies that the rr twisted moduli that are responsible
for anomaly cancellation are from the z3 twisted sectors only. for the u(1)s arising from
the d9 branes, which extend over all six compactied dimensions, all the physical rr eld
are involved. namely, the rr eld for anomaly cancellation in the d9 brane sector b9 takes
the form

i,j,k ,

b9 xi,j,k

(35)

where i,j,k are the rr partner of the twisted sector moduli i,j,k of z3. for the d53 branes
sitting at the origin, extending over the ith complex coordinate, the relevant rr eld for
anomaly cancellation b53 takes the form

b53 xi

1,1,i .

(36)

b51 and b52 have similar forms. the situation in the model with wilson line is more
complicated and will be discussed later.

b. anomaly cancellation

the u(1) mixed anomalies in the eective theory are cancelled by the exchange of twisted
sector rr elds between the gauge bosons, as discussed in [16]. the amplitude for this
process is given by the expression

where ,  = 9, 5i denote the brane sectors from which the u(1) group and the non-abelian
group arise; p is the order of the orbifold group, which for the z2  z2  z3 orientifold takes
the value 2 (2 2 3) = 24, and k runs over all the twisted sectors. the factor c

from string tadpole calculations. in the case of  = ,

z3 action gives c

c

2 (v) = 33. if  = 9 and  = 5i,

k (v) = (1)k2 sin(kvi) ,

which gives c 95i

1 (v) = c 95i

2 (v) = 3 for z3. if  = 5i and  = 5j,
(v) = (1)k2 sin(kva) , where a 6= i 6= j .
hence, the order 3 twists of the z2  z2  z3 orientifold give c 5i5j

when a background wilson line is introduced into the world-volume of the d9 branes,
the xed points of the orbifold action generally split into dierent sets, each of which feels
dierent gauge monodromy. the orbifold action on the chan-paton matrices is modied
accordingly at each xed point, and the total amplitude alm of the rr twisted moduli
exchange has to be averaged over all the xed points of the orbifold action [16],

where f is the total number of xed points, f runs over all the xed points of the kth
twisted sector and f is the modied orbifold action at each xed point due to wilson line
actions. for example, in a z3 orientifold model with one wilson line, the 27 xed points of
the z3 action split into 3 sets, each of them feeling dierent monodromy, z3, z3w and
z32
w , respectively. in the present model, the situation is even more complicated as we will
discuss later.
(i) anomaly cancellation of the z3  z2  z2 model without wilson lines

the four u(1)s from each of the u(6) groups are anomalous. the mixed triangular
anomalies between the four u(1)s and the su(6) and sp(4) groups from each brane sector
can be easily calculated from the particle spectrum [11]

where the row l labels the u(1) from the d9 and d5i brane sectors and the column m labels
the su(6) and sp(4) groups. as can be seen from table ii, only z3 twisted moduli contribute

to the anomaly cancellation process and eq. (37) indeed cancels the anomalies exactly. for
example, a1 1

where we used the standard su(n) normalization trb2
1 = 1/2 for the su(6) generator,
while the u(1) generators are unnormalized. (we concentrate on the cancellation of mixed
anomalies between the u(1) groups and the non-abelian symmetries, the u(1)3 anomaly
and the mixed anomalies between u(1) and gravity are cancelled in a similar way [16].)
(ii) anomaly cancellation of the z2  z2  z3 model with one wilson line

the eld theoretical anomalies between u(1)s and the non-abelian groups in this model

can be summarized in the following matrix

where the row l denotes u(1) factors from the u(4) and u(2) of the d9 brane sector, the
u(6)s of the d51,2 brane sector, and the u(4) and u(2) of the d53 brane sector. the
columns count the non-abelian groups, the order follows table iii.

the introduction of the wilson line implies a more involved pattern of anomaly cancel-
lation. in the following we separately address the anomaly cancellation for dierent sets of
anomalous u(1)s.
(1) the anomalies involving the u(1)  u(4)
as shown in table iv, non-zero contributions to anomaly cancellation, as specied by eq. (41)
come only from the z3 twisted sectors, e.g., in the case of the mixed anomaly u(1)su(4)2,
where both of the gauge groups are from the 99 sector, eq. (41) yields

1

a1 1 =

24 

2(2tr( b9

1 = c 99
where we have used c 99
normalized u(1) factor and tr b2
2 = 1/2 for the properly normalized su(4) generator. simi-
larly, using the results in table iv, we nd that all the entries a1 2 a1 4 are exactly cancelled
by alm. however, for the anomalies u(1) g2
i , where gi comes from the d51 or d52 branes,
the situation is dierent. since we assume that the d51 and d52 branes sit at the origin of
the third two-torus (as well as the origin of the second and rst two-tori), they do not feel
the action of the wilson line, which is acting on the third complex plane. therefore, the
result from eq. (41) is simply

(45)

a1 5 =

i
24  (

3)  2  2i3tr b9

2(2tr(b51

1 )2) = 2 ,

(46)

13

1 = c 95i

1 = 3 as in the case without wilson line, and b1 is the gen-
where we have c 95i
erator for the u(6) group in the d51 brane sector. similarly, a1 6  a1 8 involving the gauge
groups sp(4) (in d51 brane sector), su(6) and sp(4) (in d52 brane sector) are cancelled.
a1 9  a1 12 involve gi from the d53 brane sector, where we again have to take the wilson
line action into account. the cancellation works in the same way as in the case of a1 1 a1 4.
for example,

a1 9 =

i
24 

1
3  (

3)  2  [3  2i3tr b9

2(2tr(b53

2 )2)] = 2 .

(47)

(2) anomalies involving u(1)  u(2)
the relevant traces in table iv show that in the presence of the background wilson line, not
only the z3 twisted sectors, but also the order 6 twists generated by z3  r3 contribute to
the anomaly cancellation. the latter, however, comes with dierent ck factors. since the
5 = 3. hence,
order 6 twist is generated by the action diag(e

(48)

one sees that among the various contributions to a2 1, in the z3 twisted sectors the contri-
bution from xed points which do not feel the wilson line cancel those from xed points
which do feel the wilson line; while in z6 twisted sectors, the contributions from xed points
that feel the wilson line action cancel between each other. as a net result, a2 1 = 0. a2 3
and a2 4 cancel their counterparts from a as well. in cancelling a2 5  a2 8 in which the
non-abelian group arises from the 51 or 52 sector, the wilson line action does not have any
eect, thus a2 5 is cancelled by

a2 5 =

i
24  (

3)  2  2i3tr b9

1(2tr(b51

1 )2) = 1 .

(49)

when gi comes from the d53 brane sector, the eects from the z6 twists again have to be
taken into account. the net result is that the contribution from the z3 twists cancels those
from the z6 twists in such a way that a2 9  a2 12 = 0.
(3) anomalies involving u(1)  u(6)
since the u(6) group arises from the d51 or d52 brane sectors, where the wilson line acts
trivially, the cancellation of anomalies of this type is the same as in the original model
without wilson line.

we have also checked explicitly all the u(1)3 anomalies in the model, and conrmed that

they are exactly cancelled by the generalized gs mechanism.

iv. fayet-iliopoulos terms and gauge coupling corrections

a. fayet-iliopoulos terms

the supersymmetric completion of the term (34) generates the fayet-iliopoulos (fi)
terms for the associated anomalous u(1)s. 4 in the case of z2  z2  z3 orientifold, the fi
term of the u(1)a in the d9 brane sector takes the form

9

f i z d4x tr(z3(0))

3

xi,j,k=1

i,j,k ,

(50)

where i,j,k are the ns-ns sector moduli arising from the z3 twisted sectors, since, as
we argued earlier only z3 twisted sectors contribute to the anomaly cancellation process.
(notice that we are summing over only half of the twisted sectors.) the fi terms of the
anomalous u(1) from the 51 branes involve the ns-ns moduli i,1,1, those from 52 branes
involve 1,i,1, etc.. in the following, we discuss the fi terms when a background wilson line
is added.
(a) the fi term of the u(1)s from d9 branes
for the anomalous u(1)  u(4),

where i,j,k are moduli elds from z3 twisted sectors and the overall normalization factor
has been suppressed. note that, although the blowing-up modes i,j,k form a convenient
basis, they are not physical moduli of z3. as discussed earlier, only a specic combination
of nine blowing-up modes is physical.

in the case of u(1)  u(2), the order 6 twists also contribute,

(52)

4note that there could be sigma-model anomaly corrections to the fi-terms [4], proportional to
the untwisted sector moduli. (see also ref. [20].)

15

(b) the fi terms of the u(1)s from d53 branes
since the 53 sector is subject to the wilson line action, the basic forms of the fi terms are
the same as in the d9 brane sector. however, since 53 branes sit at the origin of the 1st and
2nd complex tori, only those moduli with i = j = 1 are involved. hence,

53

f i,1  (2i3)tr b53

2 (1,1,1 + 1,1,2 + 1,1,3) ,

is the fi term for the u(1)  u(4). on the other hand,

53

f i,2  (i3)tr b53

1 (21,1,1  1,1,2  1,1,3) + (3)tr b53

1 (1,1,2  1,1,3) ,

(53)

(54)

gives the fi term for the u(1)  u(2).
(c) the fi terms of the u(1)s that arise from d51 and d52 branes
as suggested by the anomaly cancellations, only moduli associated to the z3 twists are
relevant. hence, the fi term for the u(1) in the 51 brane sector is

51

f i  (2i3)tr b51

1 (1,1,1 + 2,1,1 + 3,1,1) ,

and for the u(1) from d52 branes,

52

f i  (2i3)tr b52

1 (1,1,1 + 1,2,1 + 1,3,1) .

(55)

(56)

b. gauge coupling corrections

the gauge kinetic functions receive corrections from the twisted sector blowing-up modes,
in a mechanism related to the chern-simons term [4,12,18,19]; they have their origin in the
second-order corrections, and the proposed form of the corrections [4] was conrmed by
recent explicit string calculations [18]. the holomorphic gauge coupling function is of the
form:

f = s + f (r),

(57)

where s is the (untwisted sector) dilaton for d9 brane sector or the untwisted toroidal
modulus ti for d5i brane sectors. for a zn orbifold, the correction can be expressed as

f (r) xk

tr(k(0)2)xl,m,n

l,m,n,

(58)

where the summation is over half of the twisted sectors, and l,m,n are the ns-ns twisted
sector moduli associated with the particular twist. (again an overall normalization factor
is suppressed.) in the case of the z2  z2  z3 model, f receives non-trivial contributions
from z3 twists only (cf. table ii), such that

f 9

(i,j,k) ,

(59)

and

f 9

2  4tr((b9

2)2 + s9

2s9
1)

(i,j,k) ,

3

xi,j,k

(60)

for the su(6) and sp(4) groups in the d9 brane sector. the corrections take a similar form
for gauge groups arising from the d5i brane sector, except that the summations over i, j, k
are replaced by xed values j = k = 1, k = i = 1 and i = j = 1, respectively.

with the wilson line, in the d9 brane sector, table iv shows that the gauge coupling of
su(4) receives non-zero corrections, as specied by eq. (58), only from z3 twists. it takes
the form

1  2tr( b9
2)2
f 9

3

(i,j,k) ,

xi,j,k=1

(61)

while the gauge coupling correction for su(2) ( u(2)), gets contributions from order three,
and order six twisted sectors. it is of the form

2  tr( b9
1)2
f 9

3

xi,j

(2i,j,1  i,j,2  i,j,3) + i3tr( b9

1)2(1,1,2  1,1,3) .

(62)

notice that from table iv, the order 2 twist r3 appears to have a contribution to eq. (58)
with the relevant traces being non-zero. however, since r3 acts trivially on the third complex
torus, the wilson line action does not dierentiate the moduli of the r3 twist. hence, the
total contribution from the r3 sector to f vanishes after summing over k

w .

similarly, for the rst su(2)sp(2) group in the d9 brane sector one obtains

f 9

3  2((w 9

1 )2 + w 9

2 w 9
3 )

3

xi,j

(2i,j,1  i,j,2  i,j,3)  2i3((w 9

1 )2 + w 9

2 w 9

3 )(1,1,2  1,1,3) .

(63)

(64)

and the second su(2) receives the following correction to its gauge kinetic function:

f 9

4  4((z 9

1 )2 + z 9

2 z 9
3 )

(i,j,k) .

3

xi,j,k

the corrections to the gauge couplings in the d53 brane sector are very similar to those
in the d9 brane sector, except that the summation over i, j is changed to a xed value
i = j = 1.

in the d51 sector, the correction to the gauge coupling of su(6) is simply

and that of sp(4) is

f 51

1  2tr(b51
1 )2

(i,1,1),

(66)

the corrections to the gauge functions in the d52 brane sector are similar to those in the
d51 sector, except that the moduli elds which are involved are 1,i,1.

v. conclusions

we have presented an explicit construction of a n = 1 supersymmetric, three family,
type iib z3  z2  z2 orientifold with a wilson line that does not commute with the orb-
ifold group. one of the motivations for this construction was to nd a model with a gauge
group structure that is close to that of the standard model and thus provide an example
of a model with potentially quasi-realistic features. unfortunately, the only examples that
are free of non-abelian anomalies and are consistent with tadpole cancellation, while still
containing the sm gauge group as a subgroup, have a gauge group structure of the type
u(4)u(2)su(2)su(2)(u(4)u(2)su(2)su(2)(u(6)sp(4))2), and thus its ob-
servable sector gauge structure is still much larger than that of the sm. (while our study
builds on an earlier work [11], we found a dierent gauge group structure and massless
spectrum).

the gauge group u(4)u(2)su(2)su(2) can be easily understood in the t-dual
picture, in which the wilson line action on the d53 branes is dual to splitting the 32 d53
branes and placing them at various xed points, while respecting the orbifold symmetries.
in the t-dual picture, a set of 20 d53 branes is placed at the origin, which gives rise to the
gauge group u(4)sp(2) when the z3  z2  z2 orientifold actions are imposed. a set of
6 d53 branes is placed at one of the two xed points of z3 in the third complex two-torus
which are away from the origin. due to the two z2 actions, another set of 6 d53 branes
needs to be placed at the other xed point as the mirror image of the rst set of 6. these
two sets of 6 d53 branes yield only one set of physical states and give rise to the gauge
group u(2)sp(2) under the additional z3 orbifold action.
in addition to obtaining the gauge group structure, the massless spectrum and the trilin-
ear superpotential, we carried out the explicit calculation of the abelian anomaly cancella-
tions, employing a generalization of the green-schwarz mechanism (as proposed in ref. [16]
and conrmed in ref. [18]). in particular we emphasized subtleties associated with anoma-
lous u(1)s of u(4) and u(2) group factors, which are due to the non-trivial role non-abelian
wilson lines are playing in the anomaly cancellation. in addition, we also calculated the
fi-terms and the gauge coupling corrections due to the blowing-up modes, thus setting a
stage for further investigations of the physics implications of this type of models.

the techniques we have employed in order to obtain a specic anomaly free three family
model can be easily applied to the study of a broader class of type iib orientifolds, i.e.
models with other orbifold groups, and with a more general form of the non-abelian wilson
lines. in addition, a systematic formulation of the consistency constraints for this class of
string solutions is clearly an important question, and deserves further study.

5i5i-sector
similarly, if open strings begin and end on d5i branes, the chan-paton matrices have to
obey the following constraints:

(i) = ,5(i)t
(j) = +,5(j)t

1
,5 ,
1
,5 ,

(i) = e2ivig,5i(i)1
g,5i ,
(j) = e2ivj g,5i(j)1

g,5i ,

for i 6= j .

(a2)

(a3)

the sign change in the world-sheet parity projection in the last line stems from the dd
boundary conditions in the j 6= i directions transverse to the d5i branes.
95i-sectors:
further, one can have mixed states where the open strings begin and end on dierent
branes. in the 95i case, the coordinates obey mixed dn boundary conditions, i.e. they have
half-integer modings. the states can be written as |sj, sk, abi ab, j, k 6= i, with helicities
sj, sk =  1
2 , and the chan-paton index a (b) lies on a d5 brane (d9 brane). due to the
gso projection one has sj = sk. the orientifold projections now imply

 = e2i(vj sj +vksk)g,5i1
g,9 .

(a4)

the world-sheet parity operation  only relates 95i and 5i9 sectors and does not yield any
additional constraints.
5j5i-sectors:
finally, the matter states in mixed 5j5i-sectors are determined by:

(a5)
as an example, consider the z2  z2  z3 orientifold discussed in the main text. in the

 = e2i(visi+vj sj)g,5i1

g,5j .

99-sector the matter chan-paton matrices have to satisfy

(1) = e2i/3z3,9(1)1

z3,9 ,

(2) = e2i/3z3,9(2)1

z3,9 ,

(3) = e2i/3z3,9(3)1

z3,9 ,

r1,9 ,

(1) = +r1,9(1)1
(2) = r1,9(2)1
(3) = r1,9(3)1

r1,9 ,

r1,9 ,

(1) = r2,9(1)1
(2) = +r2,9(2)1
(3) = r2,9(3)1

r2,9 ,

r2,9 ,

r2,9 .

imposing these constraints yields, e.g. for (1)

(1) =

0

1  m1

0

3  m2




0

0

3  a

where a is an antisymmetric 6 6 matrix and m1 and m2 are general 2 6 matrices. under
the gauge group u(6)sp(4), a transforms as (15, 1)+2, while m1 and m2 form a (6, 4)1,
where the subscripts +2 and 1 denote the u(1) charges of the states. (2) and (3) have a
similar structure, i.e. we get three copies of each of these states [11].

introducing a wilson line w yields an additional constraint

(i) = w (i)1
w ,

(a10)

for those states that feel the wilson line action. in the case of one wilson line along the
third two-torus, considered in the main text, this would only aect states in the 99-, 5353-
and 953-sectors, since we assumed that all the d5 branes are located at the xed point at
the origin, where the wilson line is not active.

for example, in the case of (1) from the 99-sector the matrices a, m1 and m2 from

eq. (a9) get reduced to

a =  0 0

0 a! ,

m1 =  0 0

0 m1! ,

m2 =  0 0

0 m2! ,

(a11)

under

the gauge group u(4)u(2)su(2)su(2),

where a is an antisymmetric 4  4 matrix and m1 and m2 are general 4-dimensional
a transforms as
line-vectors.
(6, 1, 1, 1)(+2, 0) and ( m1, m2) form a (4, 1, 1, 2)(1, 0), where the second set of brackets
contains the u(1) charges of the elds.
a novel feature of this wilson line action is that now the three matter chan-paton
matrices in the 99- and 5353-sectors yield dierent matter states. consider (3) from the
99-sector. in the absence of wilson lines it will give the same matter states a, m1 and m2
as (1) (cf. eq. (a9)). however, wilson line action on (3) projects out fewer states than in
the case of (1) and (2) and the surviving elds read

a =  a2 0

a! ,

0

m1 =  m3 0

m1! ,

0

m2 =  m4 0

m2! ,

0

(a12)

where, in addition to the states (6, 1, 1, 1)(+2, 0) and (4, 1, 1, 2)(1, 0) discussed above, we
have an antisymmetric 2  2 matrix a2, corresponding to a (1, 1, 1, 1)(0, +2), and two-
dimensional line vectors m3 and m4 which form a (1, 2, 2, 1)(0,1).

appendix b: blowing-up modes from the z2 twisted sectors in

z3  z2  z2 orbifolds

the physical moduli arising from each of the three z2 twisted sectors have a similar
form, we present the explicit result for the r3 twist only. let us denote the twist elds
associated with the four (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) xed points of the rst two two-tori (j = 1, 2) under
r3 action as j
i . the blowing-up modes of the total 16 xed points are represented by the
elds i,j = 1
i 2
i . however, only the following six combinations of i,j are invariant under
the z3 rotation:
