abstract

our motivation is to nd the relationship between the commutator of coordinates and uncertainty
relation involving only the coordinates. the boundary condition with constant background eld is
connected with the rotation of d-brane at general angle. and the mode expansions of d-brane we
found is more reasonable than those appeared in literature. the partition functions and scattering
amplitudes are also discussed.

introduction

the non-commutative geometry is one of the most important and most interesting idea in the
recent string theory. [1] in an excellent paper seiberg and witten express the commutator of co-
ordinates in terms of a constant neveu-schwarz b-eld (see [2] and references therein). on the
other hand an uncertainty relation involving only the coordinates was appeared in the polchinskis
wonderful book,[3] which is developed from some discussions about dynamics of d-branes.[4,5,6]
as we know from ordinary quantum mechanics the uncertainty relation and the commutator be-
tween coordinate and momentum both involve a planck constant (over 2 )h and henceforth are
related each other. naturally, we are interested in knowing if there is any relationship between
the commutator of coordinates and the uncertainty relation in the coordinates in the domain of
non-commutative geometry.

we will nd in this paper that the boundary conditions with constant background b-eld,
which is in a special form, are equivalent to the rotation of d-branes (including their analytic
continuation, the relative motion of d-branes). so we may use these properties of d-brane to seek
the relationship mentioned above.

the rotations of d-branes are discussed by several authors.[3,7] however, it seems to us that
the mode expansions are hard to reduce into the parallel d-branes (including nn, dd, nd, dn
coordinates) when the rotated angles vanish (or /2 , in case where vanishing angle leads to
perpendicular d-branes ). by using the above equivalence we nd new mode expansions proposed
in this paper is more convincing. that is also the main part of our positive results.

given the relevant mode expansions we can calculate the partition functions easily.

in con-
crete, we study d0-d4 and d4-d4 open strings. they have dierent partition functions but same
non-vanishing potential. by means of analytic continuation we nd the scattering amplitudes of
relative motion of d-branes identical with one given by polchinski. but it is dicult to interpret
consistently the relationship between commutator of pure coordinates and uncertainty relation in
small separation.

2 non-commutative geometry and the rotation of d-brane

following seiberg and witten [2] the commutators of coordinates can be written as

under a nonzero constant background the  can be expressed in terms of b-eld. especially in the
zero slope limit (   1/2  0, gij    0) we have  = 1/b, but we will not restrict ourselves
in this limit. in this paper, we set gij = ij, and b in a special form

now, let us consider an open string stretched between two d-branes. the rst example is d0-d4

open string which has following boundary conditions ( i, j = 1,    , 4 )

x 0|=0, =  x 59|=0, =  x 14|=0 = gijx j + 2bij x j|= = 0

(3)

in which we write x  for dimensions 5    9, because of the fact that from the last boundary condition
the d4 brane is not perpendicular to the open string directions at  =  ( it represents that the
brane has sloped or deformed under interaction with background eld ), so in general, x 59 may not
orthogonalize x 14. to get a mode expansions forx 14, seiberg and witten introduced following
complex scalar elds: z1 = x1 + ix2, z2 = x3 + ix4 and z1 = x1  ix2, z2 = x3  ix4.
but zi=1,2 are not the complex conjugate elds of zi=1,2, because that x14 can have their own
complex mode expansions unless x14 are hermitian, and then b1,2 are pure imaginary. in this
regime the boundary condition at  =  changes to [2]

zi + bi  zi = 0 ,

zi  bi  zi = 0 .

(4)

latter we refer it the twisted condition. the mode expansions have been expressed by them as
following

zi = is 
zi = is 

2 xn (cid:16)e(n+i )( +i)  e(n+i )( i)(cid:17) i
2 xn (cid:16)e(ni )( +i)  e(ni )( i)(cid:17) i

n+i
n + i

n+i
n  i

they satisfy

 zi |=0 =  zi |=0 = 0

and

bi = 

z i
 z i

|=

|= =

zi
 zi
eii + eii
eii  eii

= i

=  cot(i )   cot(i )

in an alternative description we can rewrite the boundary conditions (4) as follows

(cos(i )  sin(i )) zi |= = zi |= = 0
(cos(i ) + sin(i )) zi |= = z i |= = 0

(7)

(8)

in which we denote new world sheet coordinates for reference, which are in parallel and vertical
directions of the d4 brane

 = cos(i )  sin(i ) ,
 = cos(i ) + sin(i ) ,

  = sin(i ) + cos(i ) ,
  =  sin(i ) + cos(i ) .

(9)

to obtain the partition function of full string we should consider the contributions from another
59. to

independent dimensions which are orthogonalized with above zi and z i , but not from x 
this end let us dene

zm = x2m 1 + ix2m , z m = x2m 1  ix2m ,

(m = i; j = 1, 2; 3, 4)

(10)

except zi and z i , we introduce their counterparts zj and z j respectively. hence they observe
boundary conditions

and

 zj |=0 =  zj |=0 = 0

(sin(i ) + cos(i )) zj |= =  zj |= = 0,
( sin(i ) + cos(i )) zj |= =  z j |= = 0.

therefore we nd their mode expansions easily

zj = is 
zi = is 

2 xn (cid:16)e(n+i +1/2)  e(n+i +1/2)(cid:17)
2 xn (cid:16)e(ni 1/2)  e(ni 1/2)(cid:17)

i

n+i +1/2

n + i + 1/2
i
n+i +1/2
n  i  1/2

(11)

(12)

(13)

where  =  + i,  =   i it is very interesting that the boundary conditions (8) and (12) are
equivalent to the rotation of d4 brane

 ( sin(i )zi + cos(i )zj ) |=  z 

i |= = 0,

 (cos(i )zi + sin(i )zj ) |=   z 

(cid:16)sin(i )z i + cos(i )z j(cid:17) |=  zi |= = 0,
 (cid:16)cos(i )z i  sin(i )z j(cid:17) |=   zi |= = 0.

i |= = 0,

in fact if we assume that

(14)

zi = sz 

i + cz 
j

, zj = cz 

i + sz 
j

3

in which

from eq. (8) and eq. (12), we have

z 

i =  z 

j = 0

cos(i )s z 

i + sin(i )cz 

j = 0

and

sin(i )c z 

i + cos(i )sz 

j = 0

eliminating  z 

i from these two equations we obtain

cos2(i )s2z 

j = sin2(i )c 2z 
j .

the solution of this equation is

s = sin(i )

, c = cos(i )

in a similar method we can show that

zi = sin(i )z i + cos(i )z j

, zj = cos(i )z i  sin(i )z j

like eq.(10) we suppose that z 
xm (m = 0, 1,    , 9) with x 
from xm by a relative angle around x9.

i , zi , z 

0,9 = x0,9 = x0,9. that is to say systems x 

j , zj are combinations from orthogonal systems x 

m and
m and xm are dierent

3 d4-d4 open string

similarly we can also consider two d4 branes with relative rotation angles. the boundary conditions
for this system are

zi |=0 = z i |=0 =  zj |=0 =  z j |=0 = 0

(15)

and conditions (14) at  = . thus, the mode expansions of zj and zj are still given by eq.(13).
as for zi and zi we have following expressions

zi = is 
z i = is 

2 xn (cid:16)e(n+i +1/2) + e(n+i +1/2)(cid:17)
2 xn (cid:16)e(ni 1/2) + e(ni 1/2)(cid:17)

,

i

n+i +1/2

n + i + 1/2
i
n+i +1/2
n  i  1/2

here we nd same exponentials in eq.(13) and eq.(16), so it is convenient to use

i = i + 1/2

instead of i for d4-d4 string.

(cid:16) i = i + /2 = tan1(bi )(cid:17)

(16)

(17)

4 branes at general angles

till now we have shown that the twisted boundary conditions are equivalent to a rotation of
d-brane: an angle 1 in the (1,5) and (2,6) planes; 2 in the (3,7) and (4,8 ) planes. as a matter
of fact, we can still generalize it to more general case, that is a rotation with dierent angles in
(1,5) and (2,6) planes and dierent angles in (3,7) and (4,8) planes. to show the generalized mode
expansion we need only give an illustration: a rotation of angle  in one plane, say (1,5). we will
give up to use the zm elds, but utilize the original xm eld. reversing the above mentioned trick
the boundary conditions

 ( sin()x1 + cos()x5) |= =  (cos()x1 + sin()x5) |= = 0

(18)

are equivalent to the twisted one

(cos()  sin()) x1|= = (sin() + cos()) x5|= = 0.

(19)

therefore the mode expansions of x1 and x5 are written as follows

x1 = is 
x1 = is 
x5 = is 
= is

(21)

obviously these expressions include the parallel branes as their special cases. eq.(20a) reduces
to dd open string when  = 0, dn when  = 1/2; and the case of eq.(21) is just the opposite.
nevertheless, eq.(20b) will give nn string when  = 0 and nd when  = 1/2 .

5 world sheet supersymmetry

let us go back to the issue in which there are given background elds b. the same conclusion
about the equivalence between the twisted boundary conditions and rotation of d-brane can nd
from the boundary conditions of world sheet fermions. the latter are [2]

i = rij(b)j

r(b) = (1  2g1b)1(1 + 2g1b)

(23)

then, after the rotation (b) the boundary condition will become a simple form

i = i

(24)

once-more, we have proven that the boundary condition with constant background eld is equiv-
alent to a rotation of d-brane. rotation matrix is a special subgroup of u(4),[3]

diag(exp(i1), exp(i2), exp(i3), exp(i4))

(25)

when 1 = 2 = 1, 3 = 4 = 2. as we know a d4 brane preserves super-charges of the form
lql + rqr with

r = 01    4l = l,

(26)

in which polchinskis symbol  is also used. the supersymmetry unbroken by the rotation 4-brane
requires

2 = exp(2i

(27)

(28)

is the rotation in the usual spinor basis.[3] since 1 = 2, 3 = 4 in our case, there are 1/4
unbroken supersymmetries of total 16, if a 6= 0.

although there are unbroken supersymmetries the potential is nonzero.

6 partition functions

from mode expansions (5),(13),(16) we know

[n+, m+ ] = (n + )n,m ,

 = i or i

it is easy to nd the partition function for one such complex scalar (see for example[3])

(36)

from riemann formula, and hence we have the last equality in (35) . for the generalization to
general rotated angle, the results are the same as ref.[3]1

7 discussion for dynamics

in this section, let us focus on the d4-d4 case. by imitating an analysis made by polchinski we
may study the interaction of d-branes by means of analytic continuation. since any x i on d4

1 because of the last term in relevant riemann formula is positive [8], we must change sign for one of a in

(13.4.22) in reference[3].

brane has neumann boundary condition just like the time component x 0. we can analytically
continue one of x i to be the time, say x 1  i x 0 ( x 0 continues to a space dimension ). then the
rotation in (1,5) plane will become a relative motion with velocity

v = ib1 = i tan( 1) = tanh(u),

u = i .

(37)

now, the full answer is a combination of a rotation (0, 1, 2, 2), and a relative motion (iu, 0, 0, 0).
according to ref[3] the scattering amplitude is expressed as follows

a = iz

where y is a separation along the 9-direction (here we use the same  to denote minkowski time,
not the euclidean one). polchinski analyzed the small v ( so v  u ) and even small r case for
nontrivial potential (see also [6]). that is ut  v
v , he wrote down an
r2
uncertainty inequality

 1. let x  r, t  r

(39)

although non-commutators ij are proportional to the string tension constant , they depend on
velocity too. this is quite dierent from the ordinary quantum mechanics except there were reason
we could rescale coordinates in terms of b1. it might be more questionary that the separation r
is not in 5-direction but essentially in the 9- direction. we expect that there will appear more
convincing interpretation.
