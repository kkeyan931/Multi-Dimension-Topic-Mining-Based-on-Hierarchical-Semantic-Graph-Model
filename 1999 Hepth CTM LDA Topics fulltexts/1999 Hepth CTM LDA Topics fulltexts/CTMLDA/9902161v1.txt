abstract

we review recent work on the study of n = 2 super yang-mills theory with gauge group su (n )
from the point of view of the whitham hierarchy, mainly focusing on three main results: (i) we
develop a new recursive method to compute the whole instanton expansion of the low-energy ef-
fective prepotential; (ii) we interpret the slow times of the hierarchy as additional couplings and
promote them to spurion superelds that softly break n = 2 supersymmetry down to n = 0
through deformations associated to higher casimir operators of the gauge group; (iii) we show that
the seibergwitten-whitham equations provide a set of non-trivial constraints on the form of the
strong coupling expansion in the vicinity of the maximal singularities. we use them to check a
proposal that we make for the value of the o-diagonal couplings at those points of the moduli space.

introduction

the study of non-perturbative phenomena in quantum eld theory has experienced drastic advances
since, in 1994, seiberg and witten gave an ansatz for the exact eective action governing the low-energy
excitations of su (2) n = 2 super yang-mills theory [1]. it is given in terms of an auxiliary complex
algebraic curve, whose moduli space is identied with the quantum moduli space of the low-energy
theory m, and a given meromorphic dierential, dssw , that induces a special geometry on m.
apart form its unquestionable beauty, it proved to contain nontrivial dynamical information about the
non perturbative behaviour of the theory. for example, the existence of a connement mechanism when
breaking n = 2 to n = 1 by addition of a mass term. the solution was soon extended to the case
of su (n ) [2, 3]. still, the price to pay was the need for n = 2 supersymmetry. soft supersymmetry
breaking was shown to preserve the analytic properties of the solution in such a way that exact results
in the n = 0 theory could be obtained [4, 5, 6].
interestingly enough, it was soon realized that the seibergwitten solution could be reformulated in
terms of certain integrable systems, dssw being a solution of their averaged (whitham) dynamics
[7]. for example, the periodic toda lattice is the proper integrable system whose averaged dynamics
corresponds to pure n = 2 super yang-mills theory for the whole ade series [8]. the spectral curve
g of the particular integrable system is identied with the auxiliary seibergwitten algebraic curve.
its moduli, in spite of being local invariants, evolve with respect to the so-called slow times tn. the

1

system of non-linear equations that describe this evolution, that amounts to adiabatic deformations of
an hyperelliptic curve, was developed by whitham [9]. surprisingly, this system turns out to be itself
integrable and receives the generic name of whitham hierarchy (see [10] and references therein).

the whitham dynamics can be thought of as a generalization of the renormalization group (rg) ow
[7] (see [11] for a review). the corresponding rg equations were recently derived by gorsky, marshakov,
mironov and morozov [12]: the second derivatives of the prepotential with respect to whitham slow
times tn result to be given in terms of riemann theta-functions. we would like to show, in this talk,
that this framework is very fruitful both to study many features of the low-energy dynamics of n = 2
super yang-mills theory, as well as to implement natural generalizations of the seibergwitten solution.

we shall start by giving a telegraphical account of the seibergwitten solution to the low-energy
dynamics of su (n ) n = 2 super yang-mills theory and of the basic ideas involved in the whitham
hierachies. we will mainly focus on the fact that they lead naturally to the concept of a prepotential and
establish thereby the concrete link between both formalisms. within this framework, we rst develop a
new recursive method to compute the whole instanton expansion of the low-energy eective prepotential.
then, we interpret the slow times of the hierarchy as additional couplings and promote them to spurion
superelds that softly break n = 2 supersymmetry down to n = 0 through deformations associated
to higher casimir operators of the gauge group. we discuss in some detail the case of su (3). finally,
we show that the seibergwittenwhitham equations provide a set of non-trivial constraints on the
form of the strong coupling expansion in the vicinity of the maximal singularities. we use them to
check a proposal that we make for the value of the o-diagonal couplings at those points of the moduli
space. most of the work presented in this talk (the rst two applications) was developed by the authors
in collaboration with marcos marino [13]. the analysis of the strong coupling expansion near the
maximal singularities was done in [14]. further generalizations, like extensions to other lie algebras
and/or inclusion of matter, remain interesting problems of research [15].

ii the seibergwitten solution

the classical potential of n = 2 super yang-mills theory with a vector multiplet in the adjoint represen-
tation of su (n ) has at directions. there is a family of inequivalent ground states that constitutes the
classical moduli space m0, parametrized by a constant vev of the scalar eld  in the cartan sub-algebra

<  >=

n 1

xi=1

aihi = diag (e1(ai), . . . , en (ai)) ,

(1)

where ei(a) = i  a, i being the i-th fundamental weight of the lie algebra an 1. at a generic point
of m0, the unbroken gauge symmetry is u (1)n 1. in fact, for every positive root +, a couple of gauge
gets a mass m+ (a) = 2|+  a| through the higgs mechanism. they are bps states
bosons w +
with central charge z+, z   a and a = aii with i the simple roots. gauge invariant coordinates
for m0 can be constructed from the characteristic polynomial



wan 1(, uk) = det( <  >) = n  u2(a)n 2  u3(a)n 3    un (a) ,

(2)

whose coecients, uk(a), are nothing but the casimir operators. each microscopic theory, characterized
by a value of the uk, leads to one eective eld theory at low energies. we may therefore think of the
quantum moduli space m of eective eld theories as being parametrized by uk(a) < tr k >. it
will look like a deformation of m0, with the quantum generated scale  as the deformation parameter.
the microscopic relations, thus, should be recovered for   0.

2

the low-energy eective action can be entirely written in terms of a single holomorphic function of the
cartan variables, f(ai), known as the eective prepotential. by means of symmetry considerations
[1, 2, 3], the most general expression for f(ai) is
z 2

xk=1

(3)

where 0 is the bare coupling constant and fk(a) are weyl invariant combinations of ai, whereas k is
the instanton number. the full prepotential is homogeneous of degree two in ai and . what remains
to be computed are the instanton corrections, fk(a). it is their exact determination the whole point of
the seibergwitten solution. in the semiclassical limit, the rst few terms can be computed explicitely
in the microscopic theory [16], and their agreement with the output of the seibergwitten solution
provides a non-trivial consistecy check of it.

since the eective prepotential (3) is holomorphic, the imaginary part of its second order derivatives
with respect to the cartan variables, imij, are harmonic functions. therefore, they cannot have a
global minimum. however, imij enters the low-energy lagrangian as an eective coupling constant: it
must be positive denite. so, ij cannot be globally dened. these conditions are automatically fullled
it ij is the period matrix of some riemann surface. this observation led seiberg and witten to the
following ansatz:
first: over each point on m labelled by uk, consider a certain hyperelliptic curve. for su (n ) the
relevant curve g is [2]
(4)
with p = wan 1. the moduli space of the family of riemann surfaces of genus g = n  1 written above
is to be identied with m. in the classical limit   0, the rational function y = w an 1(, uk) has
roots ei(a). at the quantum level, as y2 factors into the product y2 = y+y with y = (p (, uk)2n ),
the points ei split into two sets of roots of y,

y2 = p (, uk)2  42n

ei(uk)  e

i (uk, )  ei(uk<n , un  2n ) ,

(5)

that become the 2n branch points of the riemann surface.
second: at the point uk on m, the (quantum) relations between ai, ad j and uk is given by the period
integrals

ai(u) = iai

dssw (u)

ad j(u) = ibj

dssw (u) .

(6)

with dssw a meromorphic dierential given by

dssw =

p (, uk)

d ,

(7)

qp 2(, uk)  42n
and ai and bj constitute a symplectic basis of homology cycles of the hyperelliptic curve, with the
canonical intersections ai  aj = bi  bj = 0 and ai  bj = i
j, i, j = 1, . . . , n  1. the prepotential
f(a) is implicitely dened by the equation

ad i =

f(a)
ai

.

(8)

the exact determination of f(a) involves, in general, the integration of functions ad i(a) for which there
is not a closed form available. therefore, f(a) will only be calculable in a series expansion.

3

third: the bps spectrum is obtained by integrating the seibergwitten dierential dssw along all
nontrivial cycles of the riemann surface, (ne, nm) = ne  a + nm  b. in fact, this is immediate from
the previous point and the fact that the central charge of a state with ne
i units of electric charge and
nm

i units of magnetic charge with respect to the i-th u (1) unbroken subgroup can be written as

appart from the mass, what remains invariant is the intersection number of two bps states, given by
the intersection product of their respective cycles (ne, nm) and (ne, n

m)

z(ne, nm) = ne  a + nm  ad .

(9)

   = ne  n

m  ne  nm  z .

(10)

notice that this is nothing but the dirac-schwinger-zwanzinger quantization condition [17]. two dyons
are mutually local if they have zero intersection    = 0.
changes in the symplectic basis of homology cycles are performed by means of a symplectic matrix
  sp(2r, r). accordingly, a = (ai, ad j) transforms as a vector and ij as a modular form. since the
central charge, zn = nt  a with n = (ne
m), is an observable, the invariance of the non-perturbative
bps spectrum breaks the continuous duality group sp(2r, r) down to the discrete subgroup sp(2r, z).
fourth: there are singularities in m, encoded in the quantum discriminant ,

i , nj

(uk, ) = yi<j

i  e+
(e+

j )2(e

i  e

j )2 = c 2n 2

+ ,

(11)

i , e

at whose zero locus, , two branch points e
j collide. what is the same, a certain homology cycle
on the riemann surface shrinks to zero at , signaling the appearance of an extra massless state which
is generically a dyon. these singularities lie on curves that intersect at points where many bps states
become simultaneously massless. in particular, at the so-called n1 points, exactly n1 mutually local
monopoles become massless. this is the maximal number of mutually local simultaneously massless
bps states. the physics of these points was rst investigated in ref.[18]. they remain the vacua of the
n = 1 theory upon perturbation of the n = 2 theory by a mass term. for su (n ), n > 2, there are
regions in m where mutually non-local dyons become simultaneously massless, and the corresponding
eective low-energy dynamics seems to be given by a superconformal eld theory [19].

iii the universal whitham hierarchy

the name whitham hierarchy stands for a wide class of integrable systems of dierential equations that
describe modulations of solutions of soliton equations [9, 20, 21]. following krichever [10], we dene
the moduli space of the whitham hierarchy by

mg,p  {g, pa, a(p ), a = 1, ..., p}

(12)

containing the following set of algebraicgeometrical data:
 g denotes a smooth algebraic curve of genus g.
 pa is a set of p points (punctures) on g in generic positions (we will consider, for simplicity, p = 1).
 a are local coordinates in the neighbourhood of the p points, i.e. a(pa) = 0.
from the general theory of meromorphic dierentials over riemann surfaces we know that there are
three basic types of abelian dierentials:

4

in any open set u  g, with complex coordinate , they are of the
i. holomorphic dierentials, dwi.
form dw = f ()d with f an holomorphic function. the vector space of holomorphic dierentials on a
genus g riemann surface has complex dimension g. if the curve is hyperelliptic (4), a canonical basis
{dwj} of this vector space is dened through
dwj = i

dwj = ij ,

(13)

j

iai

ibi

where ij is the period matrix of the complex curve.
ii. meromorphic dierentials of the second kind, dp,n. they have a single pole of order n + 1 at point
p  , and zero residue. in local coordinates , we shall adopt the normalization

dp,n = (n1 + o(1)) d .

(14)

this xes dp,n up to an arbitrary combination of holomorphic dierentials. there are several ways to
x this normalization. in the context of integrable theories, the standard way to do it is to require that
dp,n has vanishing ai-periods

dp,n = 0 .

iai

(15)

iii. meromorphic dierentials of the third kind, dp,0. they have rst order poles at p and p0 (a
reference point) with opposite residues taking values +1 and 1 respectively. in local coordinates  (0)
about p (p0),
(16)
the regular part is normalized by demanding that dp,0 has vanishing ai-periods. the appearance of
simple poles in the seibergwitten solution is related to the inclusion of matter hypermultiplets in the
fundamental representation [1]. we will only consider in this talk the case of pure su (n ), n = 2 super
yang-mills theory. thus, we are going to rule out the meromorphic dierentials of the third kind from
our discussion.

dp,0 = (1 + o(1))d = (1

0 + o(1))d0 .

the standard whitham equations take the following form [21]

dn
t m =

dm
t n

(17)

where dn is short for dp,n, and t n are a set of slow times the 1-forms may depend upon. according to
our previous remark, n will be considered greater or equal than one, unless the contrary is stated. the
whitham hierarchy can be enhanced to incorporate also holomorphic dierentials dwi, with associated
parameters i, such that

dwi
j =

dwj
i

dwi
t n =

dn

dn
t m =

t n .

(18)

equations (18) are nothing but the integrability conditions implying the existence of a generating
dierential ds satisfying

ds
i = dwi

ds
t n = dn .

(19)

the whitham equations hide a certain holomorphic function named prepotential f(i, t n), that can
be dened implicitely through the following set of equations
f
t n =

nds .

the local behaviour of the generating dierential near the puncture p is then

(21)

an interesting class of solutions, and certainly that which is relevant in connection with n = 2 super
yang-mills theories, is given by those prepotentials that are homogeneous of degree two:

n 1

xi=1

i + xn1

t n f

t n = 2f .

the generating dierential ds for homogeneous solutions admits the following form [8, 10]:

ds =

xi=1

t ndn ,

and, after (13)(15), the parameters i, and t n can be recovered from ds as follows:

i = iai

ds

t n = resp nds .

inserting (19) and (24) into (22), a formal expression for f in terms of ds can be obtained [22],

f =

following [22], let us consider the decomposition of ds in a dierent basis of abelian dierentials,

t nd n ,

ds = xn1

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

where d n are meromorphic dierentials of the second kind (with the same local behaviour than dn),
whose regular part is xed by the condition:

d n
moduli

= holomorphic .

(27)

notice that we have not added explicitely holomorphic dierentials in ds: they are somehow hidden
inside the dierentials d n. in more concrete terms, the denition of the i parameters as given in
(24), now forces them to depend on t n and uk. conversely, provided we impose that di/dt n = 0, an
implicit set of homogeneous functions uk(t n, i) of degree zero is obtained, and they solve the whitham
equations:

uk

t n =   i

finally, from (24) and (26), it is clear that

iv the seibergwittenwhitham formalism

the next task is to look for an embedding of the seibergwitten ansatz within the whitham hierarchy.
we will follow very closely, to this end, the approach of gorsky, marshakov, mironov and morozov [12].
as already noticed in ref.[7], the curve (4) is the hyperelliptic representation for the spectral curve of
the periodic toda chain of length n . it can be written in terms of a complex parameter w as follows
(we set  = 1 for convenience)

p = (cid:18)w +

1

w(cid:19)

y = (cid:18)w 

1

w(cid:19) .

(30)

this denes a natural coordinate in the vicinity of the two points at innity   (y = ,  = ).
in fact, from eq.(30), w can be written as a meromorphic function

w =

1
2

(p + y) ,

(31)

that near  goes as w  n . then,  = w1/n are local coordinates at the punctures , which
are the points where the relevant meromorphic dierential of the seibergwitten solution, dssw , has
its (second order) poles. the times associated to each puncture will be denoted with positive and
negative subindices, i.e. t,n = tn. also, it is convenient to slightly change the normalization of our
second-kind dierentials to be dn  n
the seibergwitten dierential, dssw , belongs to the class of solutions of the whitham hierarchy that
fulll

n dwn/n .

ds

moduli

= holomorphic .

(32)

in fact, since its ai-periods are ai, one is tempted to identify dssw as the generating form of the
whitham hierarchy at i = ai and t1 = 1, t|n|>1 = 0,

dssw = aidwi + d+,1 + d,1 .

(33)

varying eq.(30) for a given curve, i.e. for xed uk and , the seibergwitten dierential can be written
as

dssw =

d =

(34)

p

this making extremely easy to verify the dening property of dssw ,

k = 2, 3, ..., n .

(35)

if we hold  xed instead of , there is an additional total derivative in the previous expression.
notice that, from the point of view of the whitham equations, it matters which coordinates are held
xed as long as there are residues to be computed. it will always be understood that derivatives w.r.t.
the moduli are taken at constant w.

the important ingredient is the riemanns theta function e(~z| ), e being the following even and
half-integer characteristic [13]:

ai(uk, t1)) [13]. the restriction to the submanifold tn>1 = 0, yields formulae which are suited for the
seibergwitten solution. in particular, from (37) and (38) we obtain

v instanton corrections

instanton calculus provides one of the few non-perturbative links between the seibergwitten solution
and the microscopic non-abelian eld theory that it is supposed to describe eectively at low energies.
from the microscopic theory point of view, instanton contributions to the asymptotic semiclassical
expansion of the eective prepotential have been computed, and a remarkable agreement with the
seibergwitten solution has been found [16]. we shall see in this section that the connection of su (n )
n = 2 super yangmills theory with todawhitham hierarchies embodies in a natural way a recursive
procedure to compute the instanton expansion of the eective prepotential up to arbitrary order.
to begin with, let us x our conventions. we choose the basis hk = ek,k  ek+1,k+1 for the cartan
subalgebra and ek,j, k 6= j for the raising and lowering operators. let {i}i=1,...,n 1 stand for the
simple roots of su (n ) and (, ) denote the usual inner product constructed with the cartan-killing
form. the dot product    2(, )/(, ) = (, ). we have that i j = cij, with cij the cartan
j dene the fundamental weights. in particular this means that i = pj cijj.
matrix, while i j = i
the simple roots generate the root lattice  = { = nii|ni  z}.
the instanton expansion of the prepotential was given in eq.(3). we then have, for the lhs of (43),

of weyl orbits, since weyl reections are easily seen to be an automorphisms of r. therefore, (p) is
weyl invariant by construction. in the logarithmic derivative, e appears in the denominator, so we
need the expansion of the inverse of the theta function (see ref.[13] for details):

in terms of the previously dened coecients. if we look at the coecients in the r.h.s. of eq.(54),
it is easy to see that the expressions they involve depend on f1,f2, ... up to fk1. in fact, although
both h (p) and (p) depend on f1, ....fp, the indices within parenthesis reach at most the value k  1
as (0)
ij depends on f1, ...,fk1 since the vector  = 0 is missing from the lattice
sum. this fact implies the possibility to build up a recursive procedure to compute all the instanton
coecients by starting just from the perturbative contribution to f(a) in (3). the rst few instanton

vi soft susy breaking with higher casimir operators

soybroken supersymmetric models oer the best phenomenological candidates to solve the hierar-
chy problem in grandunied theories. the spurion formalism [24] provides a tool to generate soft
supersymmetry breaking in a neat and controlled manner. to illustrate the method, start from a su-
persymmetric lagrangian, l(0, 1, ...) with some set of chiral superelds, and single out a particular
one, say 0. if you let this supereld acquire a constant vev along a given direction in superspace like,
for example, < 0 >= c0 + 2f0, it will induce soft breaking terms, and a vacuum energy of order
|f0|2. turning the argument around, you could promote any parameter in your lagrangian to a chiral
supereld, and then freeze it along a supersymmetry breaking direction in superspace giving a vev to
its highest component.

from embedding the seibergwitten solution within the todawhitham framework, we have obtained
the analytic depence of the prepotential on some new parameters tn. in this section, we will interpret
these slow times as parameters of a non-supersymmetric family of theories, by promoting them to
spurion superelds. in refs.[4, 5, 25] this program was initiated with the scale parameter  and the
mases of additional hypermultiplets, mi, as the only sources for spurions. the slow times, as eq.(41)
shows, are dual to the hm+1, which are homogeneous combinations of the casimir operators of the
group. this means that we will be able to parametrize soft supersymmetry breaking terms induced by
all the casimirs of the group, and not just the quadratic one. in this way, we shall extend to the n = 0
case the family of n = 1 supersymmetry breaking terms rst considered by argyres and douglas [19].
we dene the spurion variables sn as follows

s1 = i log 

sn = i tn ,

n = 2, . . . , r = n  1.

(58)

our independent coordinates in the prepotential are i, sn. using (37) one can nd explicit expressions
for the dual spurions:



s1
d =

sn
d =

2(cid:20)h2 + i xm2
2n(cid:20)hn+1 + i xm2

msmhm+1  xm,n2
msmhm+1,n+1(cid:21) .



msmsnhm+1,n+1(cid:21) ,

(59)

notice that, when the spurions sm are zero, we recover for the variable s1 the results of [5]. under the
symplectic group sp(2r, z), the spurions are taken to be scalars, s
m = sm. from the point of view of the
todawhitham hierarchy, this is natural in that the slow times parametrize deformations of the curve,
and should not be aected by duality transformations (which are transformations among symplectic
basis of homology cycles of the curve). from the point of view of physics, this invariance is important
because their vev is an external unambiguous input. we see from (59) that the dual times are also
invariant under duality transformations.
to break n = 2 supersymmetry down to n = 0, as anticipated above, we promote the variables sn to
n = 2 vector superelds sn, and then freeze the scalar and auxiliary components to constant vacuum
expectation values. we would like to restrict our framework to non-supersymmetric deformations of
the original pure su (n ) super yangmills theory. thus, for all sn, n  2, we only keep the top
components fn as a supersymmetry breaking parameter (by su (2)r symmetry, we can always rotate
the dn components away). in terms of n = 1 superelds we have,
sn = 2fn ,

(60)

s  s1 = s1 + 2f1

n  2 ,

11

where s1 is related, as seen in (58) to the dynamical scale of the theory. the analysis of the soft breaking
induced only by s1 has been done in refs.[4, 5].

as the prepotential has an analytic dependence on the spurion superelds, the eective lagrangian up
to two derivatives and four fermion terms for the n = 0 theory is given by the exact seibergwitten
solution once the spurion superelds are taken into account. this gives the exact eective potential
at leading order and the vacuum structure can be determined. that is, all over the quantum moduli
space, the eective action will be

(i, v i), and for m, n = 1, ..., n 1 that label spurion multiplets (sm, v m
s ). if we are near a submanifold
of the moduli space of vacua where nh hypermultiplets become massless, the full lagrangian also
contains the hypermultiplet contribution involving pairs of chiral superelds ha, ha, a = 1, . . . , nh,

where the charge of the a-th hypermultiplet with respect to the i-th u (1) factor has been denoted by
i and, in the previous equation, a particular choice of duality frame, ai, has been made. namely
na
the vector multiplets (i, v i), are such that near the singular subvariety, the light bps states in the
previous lagrangian are weakly coupled, and perturbation theory is reliable. of course, this amounts
to an appropriate choice of the basis of homology cycles (ai, bj). now, if the bps states becoming
massless are mutually local, we can always x a basis of cycles such that each u (1) couples to one
and only one hypermultiplet. this means that na
i or vanishes, the later case being possible when
nh < n  1.
the full eective lagrangian will be the sum of (61) and (62). the eective potential can be computed

we will consider in what follows, as an explicit example, the case of su (3).

vii analysis of su (3)

the n = 2 super yang-mills theory with gauge group su (3) has been analyzed in detail in refs.[3, 19].
there are two sets of distinguished singularities in the moduli space of this theory:
i. the three z2 vacua, known as n = 1 or maximal points [18], located at u3 = 276/4, v = 0, that
give rise to the n = 1 vacua when the theory is perturbed with a mass term of the form tr2 (we
denote u2 = u, u3 = v).
ii. the two z3 vacua, known as argyresdouglas (ad) points [19], located at u = 0 and v = 23,
where three mutually nonlocal bps states become simultaneously massless. the low-energy theory
there is an n = 2 superconformal theory.
we will briey describe the situation near both kind of singularities. we set 6 = 4 for convenience.

the z2 vacua

in this subsection we study the soft breaking of the theory near the n = 1 points where two magnetic
monopoles become simultaneously massless. to evaluate the second derivatives of the prepotential, we
need the values of the periods of the hyperelliptic curve and the structure of the gauge couplings. we
will focus on the n = 1 point (u = 3,v = 0), whereas the values of the quantities at the other two
points can be obtained by using the z3 unbroken symmetry. the derivatives of the casimir operators
with respect to the dual variables are given by [13]

u
ad j

= 2i sin

j

ad j

.

the gauge couplings near the n = 1 point have the structure
23(cid:19) ij + (1  ij) o

log(cid:18) ad i

1
2i

 d
ij =

ij + o(ad i) ,

(70)

(71)

where  o
ij , i 6= j are the o-diagonal entries of the coupling constant at the n = 1 point, which will
be discussed in some detail in the next section. for su (3), 12 = i
 log 2 [3]. to compute the theta
function, we have to take into account the change of the electric characteristic under the symplectic

13

transformation to the magnetic variables, ad i. indeed, the transformation law for the theta function
is given by [26]

[, ]( |) = ei(det(c + d))1/2 exp[it(c + d)1c] [, ](|) ,

where  is a -independent phase and

 = d  c +

1
2

diag(cdt)

 = b + a +

1
2

diag(abt) .

thus, the magnetic or dual characteristic, d, is

~ = (1/2, 1/2)

~ = (0, 0) .

(72)

(73)

(74)

from the leading behaviour of the theta function with dual characteristic, we can compute its derivative
at the n = 1 point of su (3),
1
i

(1  ij) .

ij 

1
12

(75)

=

4

ij log d(0| d)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ad i=0

using (70) and (75), it is easy to check the relation (46) for the  derivatives of the casimir operators.
at the n = 1 point, there is a symplectic basis for the hyperelliptic curve, such that the magnetic
charge vectors are given by na

j , ad i = 0, and from eq.(68), the condensates are given by

j = a

(76)

we see that the soft breaking induced by the quadratic and cubic casimirs gives rise to monopole
condensation in both u (1) factors, although the condensates are bigger for the soft breaking coming
from u (for equal values of the supersymmetry breaking parameters f1, f2).
in the same way, the
vacuum energy associated to these condensates is

ve = bmnfmf 

n = 

9

42 (cid:18)|f1|2 +

1

2|f2|2(cid:19) .

(77)

as expected, the soft breaking associated to u gives lower energy to this vacuum.

the z3 vacua

next we explore the behaviour near the argyresdouglas point at (u = 0, v = 4). it is convenient to
use the parameters  and  already introduced in ref.[19],

u = 32

v  4 = 23 .

(78)

the three submanifolds 3 = 1 correspond to three massless bps states which after an appropriate
symplectic transformation can be seen to be charged with respect to only one of the u (1) factors,
with variables denoted by a1, ad 1. they can be seen to be an electron, a dyon, and a monopole.
these submanifolds come together at the ad point, where a nontrivial superconformal eld theory is
argued to exist [19]. to leading order, the hyperelliptic curve splits at the ad point into a small torus
(corresponding to two mutually nonlocal periods a1, ad 1 which go to zero) and a big torus with periods
a2, ad 2  . the small torus is given by the elliptic curve

w2 = z3  3z  2 ,

14

(79)

and the meromorphic seibergwitten dierential degenerates on it to

sw =

1

22

5/2wdz .

the matrix of couplings near the ad point, at leading order, reads [19, 27, 28]

11 =  () + o()

12 = 

i
c

1/2


+ o(3/2)

22 =  + o() ,

(80)

(81)

where  is the period of the small torus (with im( d/) > 0), c is a nonzero constant and  = ei/3.
for the dual variables we have similar expressions with  d and cd.
to analyze the theta function in these variables, we need the appropriate characteristic which, using
(73) and the results in [27], is

~ = ~ = (1/2, 1/2) .

(82)

(83)

(84)

(85)

we can already obtain the behaviour of the theta function as an expansion in :

(0| ) = 

1

2c

1/2


1(0| ())


1(0|) + o(3/2) ,

where 1(| ) is the jacobi theta function with characteristic [1/2, 1/2]. now, using that


1 (0| )

1(0| )

= 2e2( ) ,

we nd the leading contribution to the derivative of the theta function

1
i

ij log  =   1

4 e2( ())

again, it can be checked that the relation (46) for v holds (for u, it is necessary to know the explicit
values of the constants).

the analysis of the condensates near the ad point is dicult because one has to take into account
mutually nonlocal degrees of freedom, and there is not a lagrangian description of this theory. in fact,
one expects that, in the softly broken theory, a cusp singularity will appear in the eective potential
near the ad point, as it happens in n = 2 qcd with gauge group su (2) and one massive avour
[25]. but we can analyze the monopole condensates along the divisors 3 = 1 and their evolution as we
approach the ad point. near each of the submanifolds 3 = 1 there is a massless bps state, and we
expect it to condense after breaking supersymmetry down to n = 0. these condensates correspond to
mutually nonlocal states but we can assume, following the discussion in refs.[5, 25], that these states
do not interact, the condensates being given by the equation [13]

2
k = 

1

(b1)11|ak|2 

eik

2(b1)11 xn=1,2

j ,

(86)

where k = 1, 2, 3 and ak are the appropriate local coordinates for each of the massless states (i.e. ak = a1,
ad 1, a1  ad 1). the quantities (b1)ij, bn
j should be also computed in the duality frame dictated by
the ak. this approximation should be good far enough from the ad point. these condensates give
only a magnetic higgs mechanism in one of the u (1) factors, and correspond to the half-higgsed vacua

15

of [19]. notice that one should perform a careful numerical study of the equations for the condensates
and for the eective potential to know if these partial condensates give the true vacua of the n = 0
theory. as we approach the ad point,   0, we see that the parameters for condensation go to zero
for both the quadratic and the cubic casimirs:

and the mass gap associated to the condensates vanishes at the ad point, like in the n = 1 breaking
considered in ref.[19].

viii strong coupling expansion near the maximal points

let us end by applying the seibergwittenwhitham equations in the strong coupling regime of n = 2
super yang-mills theory near its maximal singularities. the case of su (2) is special in that, being
its cartan subalgebra onedimensional, the whole strong coupling expansion of the prepotential can
be recursively computed without an explicit knowledge of the actual solution (a(u), ad(u)) [14], much
in the same way than the previously derived instanton corrections. for generic su (n ), however, the
sww equations do not give a closed procedure to obtain the strong coupling expansion of the eective
prepotential. aside from some technical diculties, the main problem is that, in spite of the fact that a
grading in ad i and  still exists, higher terms of the expansion appear in the equations corresponding
to lowest powers of the dual variables spoiling recursivity (see ref.[14] for details). the sww equations
do not seem to be instrumental to study the full strong coupling expansion of su (n ) n = 2 super
yangmills theory.

other methods have been derived in the literature to tackle the problem of computing the higher thresh-
old corrections to the eective prepotential. for example, in ref.[29] this has been accomplished by
parametrizing the neigborhood of the maximal singularities with a family of deformations of the corre-
sponding auxiliary (singular) riemann manifold. however, this formalism is not sensitive to quadratic
terms in the prepotential. thus, in particular, it does not give an answer for the couplings between
dierent magnetic u (1) factors at the maximal singularities of the moduli space,  o
ij , introduced in the
previous section. the existence and importance of such terms has been rst pointed out in ref.[18] by
using a scaling trajectory that smoothly connects the maximal singularities with the semiclassical re-
gion. these terms are also important ingredients in the expression of the donaldsonwitten functional
for gauge group su (n ) [27]. to our knowledge, a closed formula for these o-diagonal couplings has
not been obtained so far, except for the gauge group su (3) [3]. let us then consider the uses of the
sww equations in the solution of this problem.

we have seen before that physical quantities in the neighborhood of any maximal singularity can be
translated to a patch in the vicinity of any other by the action of the unbroken discrete subgroup zn .
we will consider in what follows the point where u2 is real and positive. the strong coupling expansion
of the prepotential at such singular point can be written in terms of appropriate ad i variables as1

where k = k/n and the logarithmic term, coming from the one-loop diagram that involves the light
monopole, has the appropriate sign and factor making manifest that the theory is non-asymptotically

1we follow here the conventions of ref.[18] to x the rst three terms of the expansion.

16

free and that there is a monopole hypermultiplet weakly coupled to each dual photon for ad i  0. the
remaining power series expansion comes from the integration of innitely many massive bps states:
fs(ad) are polynomials of degree s + 2 in dual variables and k = e3/2 sin k.
we have seen that the sww formalism allow us to relate the strong coupling expansion of homogeneous
combinations of higher casimir operators hm with that of the prepotential through eq.(46). let us
rst remark that this equation is also valid for the higher casimirs hn themselves [12]: they, as well
as their particular combinations encoded in hn, are homogeneous functions of ad and  of degree n.
thus, at the n = 1 singularities, the lhs of eq.(46) is simply

hn

 log 

= nhn =

n

(2 cos k)n ,

xk=1

(88)

where we used the fact that the eigenvalues of  are i = 2 cos i with i = (i  1/2)/n [18]. the
derivative of the casimir operators with respect to the dual variables can be computed at the same
point of the moduli space, by using the explicit representation of the curve in terms of the chebyshev
polynomials [13], resulting in

(92)

we have n  1 equations and (n  1)(n  2)/2 unknowns (the components of the symmetric matrix

these two cases the following values:

su (3) :

 o
12 = i/ log 2

su (4) : (  o

12 =  o
13 = i/ log 2
 o

23 = i/ log(2  1)

.

(93)

notice that our result for su (3) coincides with that of ref.[3] while the ones for su (4) have not been
found previously. for higher su (n ), further ingredients would be necessary in order to obtain the

17

o-diagonal couplings at the n = 1 singularity. instead, we can think of eq.(92) as a new constraint
that  o
mn must obey. in fact, inspired by the ndings in the last section of ref.[18], we propose the
following ansatz for  o
mn:

 o

with  (0)

ij being given by

ij = ijxk6=i

log(2 cos i  2 cos k)2  (1  ij) log(2 cos i  2 cos j)2 .

(94)

(95)

there is no equivalent expression available in the literature to compare with. nevertheless, we can use
precisely the sww equations (92) in order to make a non-trivial check of our ansatz for the o-diagonal
couplings (94)(95). we have done it numerically up to su(11) with remarkable sucess [14]. there is a
second check that we can do using results that do not rely on whitham equations at all. douglas and
shenker showed that the matrix  d
mn at any point of the scaling trajectory, diagonalizes in the basis
{sin k n} with certain particular eigenvalues (see eqs.(5.9)(5.12) of ref.[18]). the couplings (94)(95)
satisfy this restrictive condition in the limit of the scaling trajectory ending at the maximal singularity.
as long as our solution (94)(95) matches two very stringent and independent conditions, we believe that
it provides a faithful answer for  o
mn as well as a highly non-trivial test of the seibergwittenwhitham
formalism.
