abstract

in a recent work we showed that for a hamiltonian system with constraints, the set of

constraints can be investigated in rst and second class constraint chains. we show here

that using this chain by chain method for an arbitrary system one can x the gauges in

the most economical and consistent way. we show that it is enough to assume some gauge

xing conditions conjugate to last elements of rst class chains. the remaining necessary

conditions would emerge from consistency conditions.

introduction

it is well known that gauge theories correspond to hamiltonian constraint systems with rst

class constraints. dirac has conjectured that rst class constraints (primary or secondary) are

generators of gauge transformations [1]. despite some counterexamples [2] one can assume the

validity of dirac conjecture under suitable regularity conditions [3]. the presence of rst class

constraints and the associated gauge freedoms indicates that corresponding to any given physical

state there exist some orbit in phase space, i. e. gauge orbit. gauge transformations translate

the system along gauge orbits. one can impose further restrictions on the canonical variables,

gauge xing conditions, to make a one to one correspondence between them and physical states.

in this way the initial phase space reduces to a smaller one on which both constraints and gauge

xing conditions (gfc) do vanish. this subspace is called the reduced phase space. there are

three properties that a satisfactory set of constraints and gfcs should satisfy:

i) the set of constraints should be regular and irreducible [3].

ii) the gfcs should be accessible. they should intersect the gauge orbits at least once.

in addition they should completely x the gauges.

iii) the gfcs should remain valid during the time i.e. their time derivatives should vanish.
the property (ii) is well known. the rst and third properties though considered practically1,

shirzad@cc.iut.ac.ir
loran@cc.iut.ac.ir
1see for example ref.[4].

but are not emphasized through the literature. in most cases, people work with well-behaved

models possessing regular and irreducible constraints and propose suitable gfcs considering

the second property mentioned above.

since rst class constraints are generators of gauge transformation the process of gauge

xing strongly depends on the method of producing the constraints. for example, there are

some methods which lead to a set of reducible constraints [5, 6].

in these cases one needs

primarily a consistent method to distinguish the independent gauge degrees of freedom.

in ref.

[7] we proposed a new method, the chain by chain method, for constructing an

irreducible set of constraints. in this method constraints are classied in a number of second

class and a number of rst class constraint chains. this article is devoted to gauge xing in

the chain by chain method. we show that one only needs to nd gfcs that x the gauge

freedoms associated to the last element of rst class chains. consistency conditions generate

the remaining needed gfcs.

in this way the properties (i)  (iii) are satised consistently.

moreover, the number of necessary gfcs to be found is just equal to the number of rst class

chains that in general is less than the number of rst class constraints. we do not consider

diculties due to gribov ambiguities [8] and the problem of covariance of the formalism in this

work.

in the following section we review basic concepts of constraint systems and gauge transfor-

mations in the extended and total hamiltonian formalism. the chain by chain method is also

reviewed briey in that section. our method for gauge xing in the framework of chain by chain

method is proposed in section 3. in section 4 we examine our method in electrodynamics and

yang-mills theories. some concluding remarks are given in section 5.

2 constraints and gauges

consider a dynamical system given by a canonical hamiltonian hc(q, p) and a set of primary
constraints a
1(q, p), a = 1, . . . , n. the hamilton-dirac equations of motion for an arbitrary

function g(q, p) read [1]

where

g(q, p) = {g, ht } ,

ht = hc + xa

vaa
1,

(1)

(2)

in which, va are lagrange multipliers. equation (1) together with constraint relations a
0 can be derived by varying the total action

1(q, p) =

st = z dt ( qipi  ht ) ,

(3)

with respect to canonical variables (qi, pi) and lagrange multipliers va. gauge transformations

are dened as transformation on phase space trajectories (qi(t), pi(t)) and lagrange multipliers

that include arbitrary functions of time and leave the total action st invariant.

in models

satisfying dirac conjecture one can show that gauge transformations transform dierent classes

of solutions, belonging to dierent choices of arbitrary functions of time, to each other [3].

as is well known consistency conditions for primary constraints,

a
1 = 0, may lead to deter-
mination of some lagrange multipliers or appearing secondary constraints. in the traditional

method of producing the secondary constraints, i.e. the level by level method [3, 9, 10, 11, 12],

constraints appear in a sequence of levels of irreducible constraints. the primary constraints

form the rst level. one obtains the constraints of the n-th level,say, by considering the consis-

tency of constraints of the (n  1)-th level. by construction no new constraint emerges from the

consistency conditions of the last level.

in the chain by chain method, conversely, [7] one investigates the consistency of primary

constraints one by one. for primary constraint a

1, say, the corresponding chain is knitted via

the recursion relation

a
n = (cid:8)a

n1, hc(cid:9) .

(4)

some chains terminate when a lagrange multiplier is determined. these are second class chains

that contain only second class constraints. the remaining chains, rst class chains, which

contain only rst class constraints, end up when consistency of the last element is achieved

identically. the whole algorithm is given in [7]. following this algorithm one can separate rst

class and second class constraints from each other and arrange them in the associated chains. in

addition constraints in dierent chains commute with each other, i.e. the poisson bracket of any

element of one chain with any element of other chains vanishes on the surface of the constraints.

therefore the structure of rst class chains do not change if one replaces the poisson brackets

with dirac brackets and eliminates the second class constraints. consequently one can consider

every constraint system as a purely rst class system when the question of gauge xing arises.

in the following we study gauge xing in rst class systems. the above observations guarantee

the validity of our results in general cases.

consider a system with n rst class constraints arranged in m rst class chains:

(5)

the evolution of gauge invariant quantities may also be determined by the extended hamiltonian

he = hc + xa,i

i a
a
i ,

(6)

where a

i are undetermined lagrange multipliers, which here can be considered as independent
gauge parameters. in the extended formalism, corresponding to each rst class constraint there

exist one lagrange multiplier to be determined by gauge xing. therefore one should impose

an equal number of independent gauge xing conditions as there are rst class constraints. the

consistency of gauge xing conditions determines the lagrange multipliers. the true dynamics

of a constrained system, however, is given by the total hamiltonian dened in eq.(2). the

extended hamiltonian can be used instead of the total hamiltonian, provided that one demand

after all that lagrange multipliers corresponding to secondary constraints (and their variations)

vanish [3].

for several reasons gauge xing in the total hamiltonian formalism requires some care. first,

the number of gauges to be xed is n = pm

a=1 na, the total number of rst class constraints;
while the number of lagrange multipliers to be determined is m, which is usually less than n .

second, the consistency of gfcs may lead to additional constraints that over-determine the

system. third, the (rst class) constraints in the total hamiltonian formalism do not generate

independent gauge transformations. it can be shown [5, 6] that there exist (n  m) dierential

equations among the gauge parameters corresponding to rst class constraints. the question

arises that how can one x the independent gauges in a consistent way?. this can be answered

within the framework of the chain by chain method in a simple way as follows.

considering the set of rst class constraints given in eq.(5), one may nd m gauge xing

conditions a

na

s with the following property:

{a

na, b

n}  a(q, p)abn,na

(7)

where a(q, p) are some arbitrary functions which should not vanish on the surface of the con-
straints. in principle the set of rst class constraints a
in such an idealized system the gauge xing conditions a
s are the corresponding conjugate
coordinates and consequently as become proportional to the unity. therefore, the existence of
as can always be assumed.

s can be considered as a set of momenta.

na

na

we show that the remaining gfcs needed to x the gauge completely can be obtained by
na = 0,

1}  0, the consistency of nas i.e.

s. since {a

, b

na

using the consistency of a

na
gives a new set of gfcs as:

let us consider the poisson bracket of a

na1 with the constraints:

a

na1  {a

na, hc}.

{a

na1, b

n} = {{a

na, hc}, b
c}

= {hc, {b

n, a

na}}  {a
na

, b

n+1}

(8)

(9)

where we have used eq.(4) in the last line. using eq.(7) the above expression vanishes for a 6= b,
as well as for a = b and n < na  1. note specially that the poisson brackets of a
primary constraints vanishes. for a = b and n = na  1 eq.(9) gives:

na1 with the

{a

na1, a

na1}  a(q, p).

(10)

consistency of a

na1 leads to a

na2  {a

na1, hc} and so on. the generic terms for the

gfcs are related to each other as follows:

a

n = {a

n+1, hc},

n = 1, . . . , na  1

(11)

comparing eq.(11) with eq.(4) one realizes that the chains of gfcs are exactly the mirror

images of the constraint chains, i.e. they are knitted in the opposite direction. the whole
story goes on as follows: one begins with a
a
consistency conditions to reach a

1, goes through consistency conditions until reaches
conjugate to a
, turns all the way round through

1 at the end point. the story sounds more interesting by

, then xes the gauge by nding a

na

na

na

repeating the calculations given in eq.(9) to get:

{a
{a
{a

n, b
n, a
n, a

a 6= b
n < n

n}  0
n}  0
n}  (1)nana(q, p)

(12)

as is observed each a
the consistency of a

n is really conjugate to its partner a
n. the story ends when one investigates
1s where the lagrange multipliers are determined due to non-vanishing

poisson brackets

{a

1, a

1} = (1)na1a(q, p).

using eqs.(12) the matrix of poisson brackets of constraints with gfcs can be obtained as

follows:

ns is irreducible this result ensures that the above a

where ea = (1)na1. as is obvious, the determinant of the matrix given in (13) is proportional
to qa[a(q, p)]na 6= 0. since chain by chain method guarantees that the set of rst class con-
straints a
n, completely x the gauges [3].
each non-vanishing block in the matrix (13) corresponds to a denite constraint chain. there
emerge indeed some non-vanishing elements below the diameter coming from {a
n} with
n > n. one can redene constraints and gfcs properly to make these o diagonal elements

n, a

vanish (see [7])

4 electrodynamics with source and yang-mills

as a rst example of applying the method let us consider electrodynamics with bosonic source

given by the lagrangian:

l = z d3x{
where v () is a potential and

1
4

f f  

1
2

|( + iga)|2  v()}

rewriting l in terms of the dynamical elds a(x, t), (x, t) and (x, t) where

f = a   a.

the canonical momenta are

(x, t) = (x, t)ei(x,t),

 = f 0,

 = ,

 = 2(  + ga0).

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

it is obvious from eq.(15) that 1 = 0 is our primary constraint. then the total hamiltonian
can be written as

ht = r d3x{hed + 1
2 2

 + 1

22 2

  ga0

+ 1

2 2(k)(k) + 1

2 (k)(k) + g2ak(k + 1

2 gak)

+v () + v(x, t)0(x, t)}

where v(x, t) is the lagrange multiplier (eld) and

hed =

1
2

ii +

1
4

fijfij  a0ii.

(18)

(19)

we have ignored a surface term in eq.(19) due to boundary conditions. the secondary constraint

serves as

2 = {0, ht } = ii + g.

(20)

no further constraints emerges since {2, ht } = 0. there is just one constraint chain with two
elements.

to x the gauge one should begin with 2 conjugate to 2. a simple choice is the coulomb

gauge 2 = iai. consistency condition of 2 then gives another gfc as

1 = {2, hc} = ii + iia0.

(21)

using eq.(20) one has ii  g, hence from eq.(21) the scalar potential a0 is determined in
this gauge to be

a0(x, t) = z d3y

g(y, t)
|x  y|

.

(22)

one important point to be noted is that if one has imposed the famous gauges 2 = iai and
1 = a0 then the consistency condition 2 = 0 would over-determine the system by imposing
 = 0.

as a second example consider pure yang-mills theory given by:

where

l = 

1

4 z d3xtr(f f  )

f  = a   a + ig[,  ]

the dynamical elds aa

(x, t) are implemented as

a =

where as are generators of a lie algebra with structure constants c c

ab:

[a, b] = ic ab

c c.

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

the canonical momenta are a

 = f a

0, where a

1 = a

0 serves as the set of primary con-

straints. the canonical hamiltonian is

hc = z d3x{

where a surface term is ignored. the total hamiltonian is

ht = hc + z d3xva(x, t)a

0(x, t).

the secondary constraints follow from the consistency of primary constraints as:

a
2(x, t) = {a

0, ht }  ia

as in electrodynamics, one may choose the rst set of gfcs as

consistency of this gauge leads to

5 conclusion

chain by chain method provides a simple constraint structure. in this method the constraints

are irreducible. each constraint belongs to a chain that is identied by one of the primary con-

straints. some chains possess only second class and others possess only rst class constraints.

constraints in dierent chains have vanishing poisson brackets and constraints belonging to

each chain satisfy the recursion relation given in eq.(4). this structure provides a simple and

consistent method for gauge xing. one searches for a set of constraints that eliminate the

gauge freedom associated to the last elements of rst class chains. one obtains the remaining

necessary gauge xing conditions by imposing consistency conditions.

in this method gauge

freedom associated to rst class constraints belonging to each rst class chain is xed indeed by

only one gauge xing condition. this is exactly the case in the lagrangian formalism. given

a lagrangian, one may x the gauge partly by adding some proper terms to the lagrangian.

switching to the hamiltonian formalism the corresponding primary rst class constraints dis-

appear and consequently the related rst class chains would not emerge. in other words every

gauge xing term that is added to the lagrangian xes the gauge freedom associated to one rst

class chain. this conrms our method for gauge xing.
