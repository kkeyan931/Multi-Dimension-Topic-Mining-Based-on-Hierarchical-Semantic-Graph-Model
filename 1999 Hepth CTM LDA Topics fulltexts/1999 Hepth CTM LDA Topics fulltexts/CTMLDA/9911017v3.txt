1 introduction

our present understanding of the observed fundamental interactions is en-
compassed, on the one hand, for the strong, weak and electromagnetic inter-
actions by the standard model and on the other hand for the gravitational
interaction by einsteins classical theory of general relativity which, however,
can not be consistently quantized.

although the success of some of the unied gauge theories (based on the
point-like quantum elds concept), there are too many arbitrary parameters
and some of the outstanding problems like the higgs, spontanious symmetry
breaking mechanism, kobayachi moskawa metrix etc... are still unsolved.

the discovery in the summer of 1984 by green and schwarz [1] of the
unique anomaly free open superstring has once again spurred an enormous
interest in string theories as candidates for unied quantum theories of all
interactions and matter.

as opposed to point-like particles in ordinary eld theories, the funda-
mental constituents of string theories are 1-dimensional objects. a single
classical relativistic string can vibrate in an innite set of normal modes,
which, when quantized correspond to an innite set of states with arbitrary
high masses and spins.

these theories can be consistently quantized for one specic dimension of
space-time only. this critical dimension is 26 for the bosonic string (open or
closed) and 10 for the superstring [2], [3]. however, to keep contact with the
real world, the extra space-time dimensions have to be compactied. it turns
out that there are too many ways to do a such procedure and consequently,
the four-dimensional low energy physics is not unique [4]-[12]. thus, there is
still no clear answer to the important problem of compactication and how
contact can be made with a realistic phenomenology.

in this paper, and as a toy model, we consider a closed bosonic string and

study the eect of successive toroidal compactications.

in section 2, we present general solutions resulted from various types of an
even dimensional tori compactications. in section 3, we display our results
and draw our conclusions.

the nambu-goto action of a closed bosonic string is given by[2],[3] :

with :

2 z d d[(x  x)2

s = 

x( + ,  ) = x(,  )

(1)

(2)

and ,  are the dimensionless world-sheet parameters. here  is the string
 (resp. x
scale and x (resp.

equation of motion (in the orthonormal gauge)

.
x) means x

which satises the boundary condition (??) is :

n exp2in(  ) +e

n exp 2in( + )] (4)

where q and p are the string center of mass coordinates and the momentum
respectively.

after quantization, the critical dimension is xed to d = 26 and the

physical states |iphys are subject to the virasoro conditions :

ln |iphys = eln |iphys = 0

(l0  el0) |iphys = 0
(l0 + el0  (0))|iphys = 0

where the virasoro generators ln and eln are given by :

ln =

(here (0) = 2). to get the mass spectrum, one has to apply the following
mass operator m 2

m 2 = 4[n + fn  (0)]
on the physical states |iphys (we have taken 1
n |iphys = fn |iphys

where

2 = 1) with :

n =

(7)

now, our compactication program consists of starting from the critical
dimension d = 26 and then truncating the extra dimensions successively
through a various number of tori compactications.

we remained the reader that an rdimensional torus t r is dened as the
set r/, where  is an rdimensional lattice generated by a basis {e ,  =
1, r}. one can also dene a dual lattice  as
 = n  rr/  ,  
with a dual basis {e ,  = 1, r} such that
e  e = 

is an integer o

2.1 method n = 1

the rst method consists of taking the left and right movers modes mixed.
thus, the compactied coordinates x can be written as :

xi(,  ) = qi + pi +

i

2 xn6=0

1
n

[i

n exp 2in(  ) +ei

n exp2in( + )] (10)

4

for the compactied coordinates xi (i = 1, r) on an rdimensional torus, one
has to identify the points under the translation by 2r in the e direction.
thus :

xi  xi +


2

rx=1

n  r  ei



(n  z)

(11)

where r (resp.r ) is the torus dimension (resp. radius in the  direction)
and therefore one can write :

xi(,  ) = qi +pi +2i ++

i

2 xn6=0

n

with :

[i

n exp 2in( )+ei

n exp 2in( +)]

pi =

rx=1

m
r

ei
kek

(m  z)

and  are the winding numbers which have the following expression :

i =

rx=1

now, after n compactication, the mass operator m takes the form :

m 2 = 4[n + fn  2

)]

(15)

(here rk is the dimension of the kth torus (

rp = 22 )). with :

with a self dual lattice and orthonormal basis, eqs.(??) and (??) become :

(18)

it is to be noted that one can characterizes the quantum physical states
|iphys by the quantum numbers n and m. now, it is easy to show, that for
r = 12( = 1, rp; p = 1, n), the number of the vectorial physical massless
states and the quantum numbers n and m is (see appendix a):

and

rp = 44

(19)

(20)

respectively. however, for at least one r 6= 12, the number of the physical
vectorial massless states becomes 44.

2.2 method n = 2:
in this method the left and the right movers of the closed string xi ( 
 ) and xi ( +  ) respectively are treated independently.
in this case, the
compactied coordinates can be written as :

i

2 xn6=0
2 xn6=0

i
n exp 2in(  )

n exp2in( + )

(21)

where the string center of mass momentum pi and epi are given on the dual

lattice  by :

it is to be noted that in this case, the winding numbers i and ei are related
to the momenta pi and epi by the relations :
i =  1
2 pi
ei = 1
2epi

this means that the lattice  and its dual  have a non zero intersection.
now, the mass shell condition (2  5  c) leads to the relation

(24)
it is important to mention that if r = 12, the massless vectorial states
belong to the adjoint representation of the tensorial product g  g, where
g, is the simply laced lie group of rank r = 22 and with a cartan matrix
g. now, if the lattice  is even and integer i.e.:

is integer and even.

g. now, if we characterize the vectorial physical states by the quantum
 = r2 = an integer or half

the momenta pi and epi are identied with the weight vectors of the lie group
numbers m and fm, we can show that for r2

integer the number  of these independent states is [see appendix b]

2 = 44+

(n is the number of successive compactications) where for the pth compact-
ication ; rp ,sp and qtp are the dimension of the compactied space, the
number of the non zero quantum numbers (m and n) and the degeneracy
of the tth
p quantum number respectively. however, if at least one of the r is
not an integer or half an integer, the number, of the physical states becomes
2 = 44.

3 results and conclusions :

to get an idea and keep our results transparent, we have considered com-
pactications on an even dimensional tori. tables 1 and 2 display various
types of compactications and the rank and order of the resulted lie groups
with both methods 1 and 2 with r = 12and 1 respectively. it is important
to notice that the results depend on :

a) the choice of the method :
in fact, it is clear from tables 1 and 2 that for the same type of compacti-
cation, the resulted lie groups obtained with the rst method are totally dif-
ferent from the second one. for example, a compactication on t 22 gives with
the rst method the following possible lie groups : so(5) so(60) u(12);
so(58)  so(22)  u(4); so(14)  so(14)  so(61); so(56)  so(5) 
so(29); so(63)  u(8)  u(5); so(44)  so(44); so(58)  so(16)  e7.
however, with the second method one gets : so(51)  so(36)  u(1);
so(36) so(3) so(51); so(45) so(45). as a second example, the ten
successive tori compactications t 2t 2t 2t 2t 2t 2t 2t 2t 2t 4
lead to no solutions for the rst method and so(11)  so(58)  u(12);
so(47)so(40)u(1); so(57)so(24)u(4); so(59)su(3)so(14);
so(3) so(37) so(51); so(58) so(11) u(5); so(48) so(36) g2;
so(58)  su(5)  u(11) for the second one.
b)type and number of compactications :
each type and number of successive compactications gives dierent re-
sults. in fact, the type t 2t 20 (for example) leads to the following lie groups
: so(12)  so(28)  so(48); so(38)  so(42)  u(4); so(8)  so(33) 
so(49); so(55) u(2) u(15); so(48) so(28) e6; so(48) so(26)
e7; however, the type t 2  t 2  t 6  t 12 gives so(20)  u(15)  u(19);
so(13)  u(17)  u(21); so(25)  u(14)  u(18).

c)tori radius :

8

the results of the successive compactications depend strongly on the
choice of the radius of the compactied tori. for example the rst method
gives for r = 12 ( = 1, r; k = 1, n), a number of 44 + 2
r2
k vectorial
physical states which can form the irreducible representation of a lie group.
however, for at least r 6= 12, this number is reduced to 44 and leads to
dierent lie groups solutions.

 = 2r2 =

rpx=1 fm2
nxp=1



(b-2)

now,it is obvious that if r2 is not an integer or half an integer, eqs.(b  1)
and (b  2) have no solutions. in what follows we denote by s the number
of the non zero fm s. as an example, for r = (2)3/2, eq.(b  3) becomes

rpx=1 fm2
nxp=1

 = 16

which can be written as:
a)1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16
b)4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16
c)4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16
d)4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16
e)4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16
f)9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16
g)9 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16
in this case, the values of s are respectively 16, 13, 10, 7, 4, 8, 5.

now, if r = 1 (case of our interest) one gets:

rpx=1 fm2
nxp=1

 = 2

13

which implies that |fm| = 1. so, the degeneracy s of fm is equal to 2. thus
the number  of all possible physical states of the form |11, 1, 0, ..., 0i,|11, 0, 1, ..., 0i ,...etc
is

 =

1
2

nxp=1

rp(rp  1) =

nxp=1

rp!

2!(rp  1)

(b-3)

this result can be found in an equivalent way by taking r number arranged
in two and without repetition. thus,the number of the dierent physical
vectorial states  is:

 =

nxp=1

2!c 2
rp
2!

=

nxp=1

rp!

2!(rp  1)!

(b-4)

now, taking into account the positive and negative values of fm amounts to

multiplying the result by 22. hence, the total number, of states tot is:

tot =

nxp=1

22

rp!

2!(rp  2)!

(b-5)

then,it is clear that for a given s, eq.(b  6) can be generalized to

tot =

nxp=1

2sp

rp!

(rp  sp)!

tpqq=1

qq!

where qq (resp.sp ) is the degeneracy of the qth quantum number (resp. the

number of the non zero quantum numbers fm ), tp is the number of the non
identical quantum numbers among the s ones for the pth compactication.
the factor
(rpsp)! represents the number of the rearrangements of rp by sp
numbers. i.e.

rp!

asp

rp = sp!c sp
rp

however, if there are some identical non zero quantum numbers, one has to

divide by the factor

qq!. notice that the factor 2sp, comes from the fact

tpqq=1

that fm can take both positive and negative values.
