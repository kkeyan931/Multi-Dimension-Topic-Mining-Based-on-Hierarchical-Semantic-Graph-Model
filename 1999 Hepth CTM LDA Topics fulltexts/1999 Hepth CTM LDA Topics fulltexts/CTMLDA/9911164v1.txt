there appears to be no natural explanation for the cos-
mological constants small size within the framework of lo-
cal relativistic eld theories. we argue that the recently-
discussed framework for which the observable universe is iden-
tied with a p-brane embedded within a higher-dimensional
bulk spacetime, has special properties that may help cir-
cumvent the obstacles to this understanding. this possibility
arises partly due to several unique features of the brane pro-
posal. these are: (1) the potential such models introduce for
partially breaking supersymmetry, (2) the possibility of hav-
ing low-energy degrees of freedom which are not observable to
us because they are physically located on a dierent brane, (3)
the fundamental scale may be much smaller than the planck
scale. furthermore, although the resulting cosmological con-
stant in the scenarios we outline is naturally suppressed by
weak coupling constants of gravitational strength, it need not
be exactly zero, raising the possibility it could be in the range
favoured by recent cosmological observations.

i. introduction

there is no understanding, at present, of why the cos-
mological constant should be as small as is required to ex-
plain the enormous size of the observable universe. this
lack of understanding is particularly vexing from the the-
oretical point of view because local quantum eld theories
appear to oer no way to account for the enormous dis-
parity between cosmological scales on one hand, and the
microscopic scales of elementary-particle physics on the
other [1]. if anything, this dismal situation only wors-
ens should better data bear out present indications for
a nonzero, but extremely tiny, cosmological constant [2],
with high-redshift supernova surveys favouring

  (3  103 ev)4,

(1)

in units for which h = c = 1.

the nature of the problem is this. the cosmologi-
cal constant can be considered to be the energy density
of the vacuum, and so samples the quantum zero-point
energy density contributed by physics at any particular
scale. however, as a rule, degrees of freedom at scale m
contribute  = o(m4), leading to unacceptably large
results. this is true, in particular, for the theories which
successfully describe all the well-understood physics as-
sociated with scales between 103 ev and 100 gev.

supersymmetric eld theories are the only known ex-
amples which evade this general statement, since these

1

theories can predict a vanishing cosmological constant
even though they involve massive particles. they can do
so only if the supersymmetry is not spontaneously bro-
ken, since in this case bosons and fermions precisely can-
cel in their contributions to the vacuum energy. unfortu-
nately supersymmetry must be broken if it is to apply to
the real world, and the absence of superpartners for the
known elementary particles implies that the scale of this

breaking must be at least of order m > 100 gev. how-
ever, the resulting failure in the bose-fermi cancellations
implies a cosmological constant which is also o(m4), and
so which is much too large.1

the purpose of this paper is to indicate a possible
way out of this dilemma, based on the recently much-
discussed possibility that all observed nongravitational
particles are conned to a domain-wall-like p-brane which
sits within a larger (4 + n)-dimensional bulk spacetime
[6]. the choice p = 3 gives the simplest picture,
in
which we are trapped on one of potentially many 3-branes
which sweep out a four-dimensional world volume within
the larger-dimensional bulk space. gravitational interac-
tions, on the other hand, are not restricted to the wall,
and so are responsible for any communication which takes
place between dierent branes. this kind of picture is ac-
tually believed to be realized within string theory, where
the branes involved can be (p + 1)-dimensional dirichlet
branes [7]. we keep this particular realization in mind,
not least since it has the advantage that the resulting
brane and bulk properties are well-formulated and con-
crete.

although we do not yet have a working model, we ar-
gue here that this framework has several new features
which may oer a way out of the usual cosmological-
constant conundrum, our purpose being to identify de-
sirable features that might guide explicit model building.
we believe the brane scenario may have something to
oer for understanding the size of the cosmological con-
stant at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels.

as viewed microscopically, it can do so because: (i)
the extended supersymmetry of the bulk space permits

1although a mechanism for obtaining supermultiplet split-
tings without a large cosmological constant has been proposed
[3] for 3-dimensional eld theories, its implementation in four
dimensions is not clear. see [4,5] for other related discussions
of the cosmological constant problem.

the classical contributions of dierent branes to the cos-
mological constant to cancel, and (ii) the inuence of
supersymmetry breaking can be suppressed by powers
of small gravitational couplings because any one brane
can be arranged to only partially break these extended
supersymmetries.

regardless of what happens microscopically, a small
cosmological constant must also be understandable on
more macroscopic scales, right down to energies that are
fractions of an ev. the brane picture can also help here,
since it permits the existence of many low energy de-
grees of freedom which we do not see because they are
trapped on other branes to which we have no direct ac-
cess. any residual symmetries which relate low-energy
states on these other branes to those on our own might
ensure the cancellation of contributions to  on scales
large compared to the inter-brane separations.

we now elaborate on these ideas, focussing in turn on

the macroscopic and microscopic points of view.

ii. interbrane supersymmetry and the

macroscopic perspective

any intrinsically microscopic understanding of the
smallness of the cosmological constant cannot be com-
plete because it leaves open why well-understood lower-
energy physics, does not ruin the story by contributing
too strongly to . we argue in this section that the brane
picture oers a new perspective for this part of the prob-
lem.

the new possibility which the brane picture introduces
at low energies is the potential it has for hiding low-
energy degrees of freedom from us. the macroscopic part
of the cosmological-constant problem states that the ob-
served low-energy degrees of freedom themselves induce
too large a cosmological constant. however, the di-
culty vanishes if there are other low-energy degrees of
freedom about which we have no nongravitational infor-
mation which can enforce the low-energy cancellations
required in .

as an extreme example, suppose the branes which ll
the universe repel one another and so in equilibrium ar-
range themselves into a lattice. further, suppose there
exist residual unbroken (or very weakly broken) discrete
supersymmetry transformations which relate the bosons
on one brane to the fermions on another. if such a graded
lattice symmetry were to force bosons on one brane to be
degenerate with fermions on another, and vice versa, then
they can cancel in their contributions to the eective 
which is observed on scales much wider than the spacings
between the branes.

we do not have an explicit brane model which exhibits
such a symmetry, but as a rst step we can ask whether
supersymmetric interactions can be devised in such a way
as to be consistent with the related bosons and fermions
living on dierent branes. imagine, therefore, construct-
ing a supersymmetric model consisting of a collections of

scalars, i, living on one brane and a collection of spin-
half superpartners of these bosons, i, living on another
brane. we imagine coupling these elds using a super-
multiplet of bulk scalars and fermions, x = {xa, a},
which couple to both branes. macroscopically, the re-
quirement that the elds i and i
live on dierent
branes amounts to asking the eective lagrangian to have
the following additive form:

l = lb(, x) + lf (, x) + lbulk(x).

(2)

an example of a lagrangian of this form, and which
has a supersymmetry relating the components of the su-
permultiplet, i = {i, i} (as well as of xa = {xa, a}),
is obtained by writing a globally-supersymmetric wess-
i i +
zumino model with minimal kinetic term, k = 
x 

axa, and superpotential

w =

mij

ij + bi(x) i + c(x),

(3)

since this implies the component interaction terms:

f (, x) = 
in this model the explicit supersymmetry is not bro-
ken, so the i and i are perforce degenerate in mass.
it is this supersymmetry which keeps the vacuum energy
precisely zero. on the other hand, for suciently weak
couplings to the bulk elds, the observable universe on
any one brane consists of either the elds {i, xa, a} or
{i, xa, a}, which would look nonsupersymmetric since
it has in either case a mismatched number of bosons and
fermions. finding a similar such model with gravita-
tional interactions and more realistic couplings amongst
the particles on a given brane would be of obvious inter-
est.

if this picture describes the way the universe really
works within a brane scenario, we see that the usual cos-
mological constant paradox is removed in a surprising
way. it may indeed be true that superpartners must ex-
ist and be degenerate in mass with all of the observed
particles, in order to understand the small size of the
cosmological constant. the new feature which branes
add to this observation is that the existence of these su-
perpartners might not be in conict with observations if
they are conned to a dierent brane than our own, and
so cannot be directly detected. it would clearly be inter-
esting to nd a realization of this scenario in an explicit
example, in order to better explore its low-energy impli-
cations, as well as its connection with the microscopic
picture, which we now describe.

2

iii. extended supersymmetry and the

microscopic picture

the previously-described macroscopic scenario for un-
derstanding the smallness of the cosmological constant is
pointless if the integration over more microscopic degrees
of freedom does not also keep the cosmological constant
acceptably small. we now describe what new features
the world-as-a-brane picture might add to this part of
the problem. we wish to argue that  may be very close
to zero because it is protected by more than one super-
symmetry, with not all supersymmetries directly broken
on our own brane.

here we will have in mind a particular scenario involv-

ing a system of branes having the following properties:
in the absence of the
1. extended supersymmetry:
branes the bulk-space theory dimensionally reduces to
a 4-dimensional system having n  2 supersymmetries.
2. multiple brane species: the compactication involves
several dierent kinds of branes separated in the bulk.
each brane will preserve some fraction of the n bulk-
space supersymmetries, and one of these branes is imag-
ined to be the three-brane on which we ourselves live.
3. partial supersymmetry breaking: although each of
the dierent types of branes preserve some of the super-
symmetry, we imagine that each of the bulk-space super-
symmetries are broken by at least one brane.

thus similar to previous discussions [8], supersymme-
try breaking is only transmitted to our own world from a
distant brane. for our discussion of the cosmological
constant, however, it will be important that (at tree-
level) there exist linearly realized supersymmetries on
each of the separate branes.

a. the relevant scales

microscopically, there are potentially three fundamen-
tal mass scales in the brane picture. the rst of these is
the scale, mb, associated with the inverse width of the
brane itself. the second is the inverse radius, mc = 1/rc,
of n of the bulk-space dimensions, which are imagined to
be small and, for simplicity, all to have roughly the same
size. third, there is the scale, ms, set by the bulk-space
gravitational couplings.
in the dirichlet-brane picture
mb and ms are both set by the string scale.

the scales ms and mc are not independent because
they are related to the 4-dimensional planck mass, mp =
(16g)1/2 = 1.72  1018 gev (where g is newtons
constant). for instance, in string theory this relation is
given by

m 2

mc(cid:19)n
p  e2(cid:18) ms

m 2
s ,

(6)

where e is the closed-string coupling, and all other
dimensionless constants are taken to be o(1).

eq. (6) permits the elimination of one of mc or ms in
favour of the other and mp. a recently much-explored
scenario daringly takes ms to be as low as the tev scale
[6], in which case mc ranges from  10 mev (if n =
6) to  103 ev (if n = 2). the requirement for a
small ratio mc/ms  1 is necessary in this picture to
ensure the existence of the hierarchy between mp and
the weak scale, mw. the question of explaining this large
hierarchy is then transferred to understanding why the
extra dimensions are so large.

we have in mind an alternative scenario for under-
standing the small ratio mw/mp, which has also been
proposed recently [9].
in this case, no small value for
mc/ms is required as input. this is possible if ms is
identied with the intermediate scale, ms  1010 gev,
since then (for n = 6) mp and mw dier acceptably so
long as mc/ms  e  1%. this scenario also has
the potential to solve another naturalness problem, i.e.,
the smallness of the qcd  parameter, by incorporating
the standard axion solution of the strong cp problem,
given that the fundamental scale ms precisely ts with
the experimental bounds on the axion decay constant
and that there usually exist brane axions which, unlike
the model independent string axion, only couple to the
standard model gauge elds and not to the hidden sector
ones. given this eciency in dealing with naturalness
problems it is then reasonable to ask if the cosmological
constant problem could also be approached in this type
of scenario. (an even more ecient mechanism has been
recently proposed [10] in which gravity itself appears to
be conned to a brane, therefore providing an explana-
tion of the hierarchy mw/mp in terms of exp(ms/mc),
although no similar suppression has yet emerged regard-
ing the cosmological constant  see, however, [11].)

ultimately, our goal is to understand  as arising as a
power of the ratio mc/ms (or, equivalently, of ms/mp).
for these purposes mc itself is taken to be a parame-
ter which is given, with no attempt made to understand
the dynamics which determines why the small dimen-
sions stabilize at the desired radius. the focus instead is
to understand the more dicult problem of how it can
be that the large dimensions can remain large even once
it is granted that the small dimensions are small.

b. cancellations at the highest energies

brane theories get o to a good start because the eec-
tive four-dimensional vacuum energy can naturally cancel
at the very highest energies. we start with a reminder of
how this cancellation works within the d-brane context.
imagine integrating out all of the microstructure of the
branes (such as string-scale physics for dirichlet branes)
to obtain the (higher-dimensional) eective eld theory
at scales below mb. we require the low-energy eective
action which governs long-distance gravitational eects
once these higher-energy modes are integrated out. at

3

scales just below mb but well above mc we have an eec-
tive (4 + n)-dimensional eld theory of the light closed-
string modes (collectively denoted by , say) of the bulk
space coupled to the light brane modes (denoted by b),
localized on the various branes (which are labelled by b).
the resulting eective action has the additive form:

s = sbulk[] +xb

sb[, b].

(7)

the form for the eective action at this point may be
robustly stated, because the form of the lowest-derivative
terms is dictated (in string theory) by supersymmetry.
the leading terms in a low-energy expansion of the grav-
itational part of the bulk-space action are

sbulk = z d(4+n)x g e2(cid:16)m 2+n

s

r + (cid:17),

(8)

where gmn and r are the (4 + n)-dimensional metric
and scalar curvature, respectively.  here is the dila-
ton eld, which is related to the metric by supersymme-
try, and is normalized so that e is the closed string
coupling strength. notice that supersymmetry precludes
the appearance here of a bulk-space cosmological term,

the analog of eq. (8) for the low-energy action for each

r d(4+n)x g .

brane is

sb = z d(p+1)  e(cid:16)b + (cid:17),

(9)

where xm() is a parameterization of the bth branes
position within the bulk space, and  = gmnxm xn
is the branes induced metric. the ellipses denote de-
pendence on other elds, and on the metrics curvature,
while the constant b denotes this branes tension. the
stability of the modes which describe the overall motion
of the branes centre-of-mass generally requires b to be
positive.

the action of eq. (9) is also dictated by the symme-
tries of the problem, being manifestly invariant with re-
spect to all of the supersymmetries of the underlying
string theory, provided that both brane and bulk elds
are transformed. those supersymmetries which are un-
broken by the brane in question are realized in the usual
way, with particle states grouping into degenerate super-
multiplets. the broken supersymmetries are nonlinearly
realized, however, with particles not grouped into degen-
erate supermultiplets, and some brane fermions, , ac-
quiring shifts under these transformations:  =  + 
[12].
a second kind of brane-like quantity which can arise in
these scenarios is a xed surface which is not free to move.
in string theory, for instance, orientifolds are obtained
by identifying points in spacetime which are related by a
parity transformation, giving rise to xed surfaces at the
xed points of these transformations. the low-energy ac-
tion acquires a contribution similar to eq. (9) from elds

4

evaluated on these xed surfaces, with the noteworthy
property that the tension, b, for such surfaces may be
negative [13,14].

imagine now integrating out all but the most slowly-

varying bulk-eld congurations, :

ei[] =z d eisbulk[+]yb

db eisb[+,b].

(10)

the eective cosmological constant, , is obtained by fo-
cussing on the lowest-derivative terms in the dependence
of this result on the four-dimensional metric, g,

 = z d4x g(cid:16) + m 2

p r + (cid:17),

(11)

where r is the 4-dimensional scalar curvature. notice
that for the purposes of identifying  it suces to con-
sider g innitesimally close to at space.

c. microscopic supersymmetric cancellations

if all of the supersymmetries of the problem are not
broken by the brane conguration of interest, then the
contributions to the cosmological constant from all of
the various branes and xed surfaces are known to can-
cel quite generally. since we will later argue that super-
symmetry might suppress the nal cosmological constant,
even when broken, we rst describe the supersymmetric
cancellation in more detail.

consider rst integrating out b in the classical (tree-
level) approximation within this low-energy theory. this
corresponds to simply eliminating these elds using their
classical equations of motion. the cosmological constant,
in this approximation, receives a contribution from the
tension of each brane, which is typically not small for any
one brane, being generically o(m p+1
). our rst goal is
to see how supersymmetry can ensure that the contribu-
tions of the branes and xed surfaces can robustly cancel
in the cosmological constant, without ne tuning.

b

to see why this is possible, consider the case (in string
theory) of several parallel branes which, taken together,
do not break all of the supersymmetry. the exact can-
cellation of the classical cosmological constant is in this
case related to the stability of these congurations due to
the cancellation of the classical forces between the branes
[13,15].

there are three steps involved in understanding this
cancellation. first notice that the unbroken supersym-
metry of any one brane conguration ensures that the
tension of any particular brane is strictly related to the
value of the nonzero ramond charge which it carries.
it is this relation which ensures the precise cancellation
between the long-range gravitational attraction between
parallel branes, and their long-range repulsion due to the
force mediated by the skew-symmetric tensor gauge elds
coupling to the ramond charge.

second, the generalization of gauss law for the skew-
tensor elds requires that the total ramond charge car-
ried by all branes must sum to zero when the transverse
dimensions are compact. this is because there is no place
for the ux of a nonzero charge to go in a compact space.
in orientifold examples the total charge vanishes due to a
cancellation between xed orientifold surfaces (carrying
negative ramond charge), and branes (whose charges are
positive). however, this cancellation of charges then au-
tomatically ensures the cancellation of the negative ten-
sion of the xed surfaces against the positive tension of

the branes, ensuring the sum pb b = 0.

third, supersymmetry ensures that this cancellation
survives quantum corrections to this classical picture.
this is because the bps nature of the branes ensures
the strict equality of their masses and ramond charges
even at the quantum level.

d. partial supersymmetry breaking

the key question is how these arguments are modied
when the brane conguration breaks all of the supersym-
metries. although we do not have an explicit model in
hand [16], we now wish to argue that the partial breaking
of supersymmetries on dierent branes opens a possibil-
ity that the supersymmetric vacuum energy cancellation
might partially persist even after supersymmetry breaks.
recall that in the scenario we wish to consider all of
the supersymmetries of the bulk theory are broken, but
that several of the seperated branes are required to do
so. in this case, because of the supersymmetry breaking,
the forces between branes need no longer strictly cancel.
if they do not, then the branes will move until they mini-
mize their energy. for instance, if the resulting forces are
repulsive the branes may try to maximize their distances
from one another, perhaps by arranging themselves into
a lattice within the compact n dimensions. if they in-
stead attract one another, they may instead form bound
states, or simply be widely separated from one another.
our assumption is that the resulting stable conguration
continues to break all of the supersymmetries. (the pos-
sible role of slow brane motion of this type for generating
ination was recently considered in ref. [15].)

now comes the main point. because supersymmetry
is broken, particle supermultiplets on any one brane will
not remain degenerate, becoming split by an amount
m, say. neither need the cosmological constant con-
tinue to cancel. however, neither of these quantities
can become nonzero without the interactions amongst
the branes which are mediated by the exchange of bulk
states. furthermore, no such contribution to mass split-
tings or the vacuum energy is possible from any bulk
exchange that is not complicated enough to know that
there are enough branes to ensure that all of the super-
symmetries are broken.

for instance, if two branes are required to break all

of the supersymmetries, with each brane breaking half,
then we expect supermultiplet mass splittings on each
brane to be suppressed by at least two powers of the small
bulk-space coupling, and so expect m2  (m 2
b /mp)2,
say. this was used in [9], for example, to argue that
the string scale should be the intermediate scale, mb 
ms  pm mp  pmw mp. for the same reason, the
vacuum energy must also be suppressed by powers of
this bulk coupling. if more branes are required to break
all supersymmetries, then suppression by more powers of
1/mp follows.

the main question is whether the vacuum energy
can be systematically smaller than are the splittings in
masses amongst supermultiplets. although we do not
know whether this can be done, if it can be ensured down
to the compactication scale, mc, then it can be perpetu-
ated to lower energies by a macroscopic mechanism, such
as the symmetry scenario given above.

it is noteworthy that this kind of suppression be-
cause of partial supersymmetry breaking is an intrinsi-
cally brany mechanism. this is because, in four dimen-
sions, it is dicult to construct models which partially
break an extended supersymmetry, as is enunciated in a
well-known apparent no-go theorem [17,18]. the situ-
ation is dierent for supersymmetric theories containing
extended objects such as domain walls or branes. in this
case the no-go theorem is evaded [12,19], with a single
brane typically breaking half of the bulk-space supersym-
metries and leaving the others unbroken. more compli-
cated congurations, involving several branes, can break
more of these bulk-space supersymmetries.

e. numerology

there are suggestive consequences of the prediction of
a nonzero cosmological constant which is suppressed by
powers of the bulk, gravitational-strength, coupling con-
stant. to see them, it is instructive to estimate the size
of the nonzero cosmological constant which might be so
obtained. imagine, then, integrating out scales between
ms and mc, for which the universe eectively has 4 + n
dimensions. from a 4-dimensional perspective this corre-
sponds to integrating out all of the massive kaluza-klein
(kk) modes whose masses are proportional to mc. sup-
pose that the rst failure to cancel the interaction energy
density requires a couplings of the bulk elds to the var-
ious branes, and b self-couplings amongst the bulk elds
themselves. on dimensional grounds, the result for the
(4 + n)-dimensional vacuum energy density is of order

 "e(cid:18) mc

ms(cid:19)1+n/2#a+b

(cid:18) 

c (cid:19)a

m p+1

m 4+n

c

.

(12)

powers of mc are included here on dimensional grounds
since this is the scale of the physics which has been inte-
grated out. the corresponding 4-dimensional cosmologi-
cal constant induced in this way is of order   /m n
c .

5

of course, the key question is to determine precisely
which powers, a and b, are required in order to obtain
a nonzero contribution to . such a determination re-
quires a more detailed knowledge of the precise brane
conguration. explicit models, probably on similar lines
as those of [4,20] will be needed in order to be more spe-
cic. our purpose here is simply to point out the general
suppression which is already implied by eq. (12). this
suppression follows from the requirement that a and b
cannot be too small if all of the branes required for com-
plete supersymmetry breaking are included.

let us evaluate eq. (13) for various choices for the pow-
, gives

ers a and b. choosing mb  ms, so that   m p+1

s

ms(cid:19)
  (e)a+b (cid:18) mc

m 4
c .

(13)

here the exponent is  = (n/2 p) a+ (n/2 + 1) b. notice
that the largest suppression occurs (for any given a and
b) when n is the largest and p is the smallest, so n/2 =
p = 3:
i.e., a 3-brane and six extra dimensions. we
make this choice in the estimates to follow, in which case
we have  = 4b. given that within the scenario under
discussion, supersymmetry is broken at the scale ms, this
is an enormous suppression compared to the contribution
  m 4
s which would be expected from standard eld
theory arguments.

in the intermediate scale scenario we have m 2

s =
mw mp and  using eq. (6)  we can reexpress the
suppressions in terms of ratios of mw/mp and e 
  1%. we obtain in this way a ratio of the form
  (3ab4)/3(mw/mp)(2b4)/3m 4
it should be
w.
stressed that comparatively few powers of mp might
be needed to produce an acceptably small result.
in
fact, it is tantalizing that a relatively small power like
w/mp)4 is already numerically smaller than the
  (m 2
experimental value of eq. (1), although to obtain this we
would need b  8. (unfortunately, more powers of b are
more dicult to arrange in specic models, so a smaller
value here would have been preferable.)

of course, these are only rough estimates and more
concrete examples are needed in order to reliably esti-
mate the precise suppression factors. in particular it may
be possible that the eective brane couplings could be
further suppressed, perhaps by having  be substantially
smaller than m 4
s , or by extra cancellations due to the
underlying supersymmetry on the brane which are not
included here. any such additional suppression could re-
duce the value of b needed to obtain an acceptably large
suppression (see for instance [5].) of course, as described
in section ii, the branes must also provide some mech-
anism to maintain the suppression of  down to lower
scales. our purpose in this note is merely to point out
that there is substantial amount of suppression to be had
already within the brane scenario, with the hopes of stim-
ulating further model building along these lines.

a number of remarks bear emphasis at this point:

1. first and foremost, it is remarkable that the world-
as-a-brane scenario may potentially provide loopholes to
the conceptual roadblocks which have thwarted an un-
derstanding of the cosmological constants small size.

2. next, it is striking that a mechanism for produc-
ing a naturally small cosmological constant also points
to nonzero values, possibly in the range currently being
favoured by high-z supernova measurements.

3. since individual branes tend to break half of the
bulk-space supersymmetries at once, the mechanism de-
scribed here suggests that our own brane might have
more than one unbroken supersymmetry, nus  2. a
careful exploration of the number of possible unbroken
supersymmetries implied by these ideas for our world
bears further scrutiny in view of the phenomenological
problems extended supersymmetric models have, such
as the diculty obtaining chiral fermions. we are not
daunted by these issues since we believe them to be eas-
ier to deal with than has proven to be the case with the
cosmological-constant problem itself.

we believe that the world-as-a-brane framework fur-
nishes numerous novel possibilities which may ultimately
explain what keeps the cosmological constant small with-
out the need of ne tuning. notice that the mechanism
crucially involves an interplay between the nonlocality of
brane congurations and supersymmetry. of course, a
key test will be whether models constructed using the
mechanism we are proposing can produce a suciently
small  while still producing a large enough splitting
amongst supermultiplets on our own brane. we believe
a concrete realization of this idea (or variations on our
theme) in terms of explicit string models to be well worth
pursuing.
