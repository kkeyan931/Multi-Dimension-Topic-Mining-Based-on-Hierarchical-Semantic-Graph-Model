abstract: in this talk i summarize several recent results concerning the fourdimensional eective su-
pergravity obtained using a calabiyau compactication of the e8e8 heterotic string from mtheory.
a simple macroscopic study is provided expanding the theory in powers of two dimensionless variables.
higher order terms in the kahler potential are identied and matched with the heterotic string
corrections. in the context of this mtheory expansion, i discuss several phenomenological issues: uni-
versality of soft scalar masses, relations between the dierent scales of the theory (elevendimensional
planck mass, compactication scale and orbifold scale) in order to obtain unication at 3  1016
gev or lower values, soft supersymmetrybreaking terms, and nally charge and colour breaking
minima. the above analyses are also carried out in the presence of (nonperturbative) vebranes.

1. introduction and summary

one of the most exciting proposals of the last
years in string theory, consists of the possibility
that the ve distinct superstring theories in ten
dimensions plus supergravity in eleven dimen-
sions be dierent vacua in the moduli space of a
single underlying elevendimensional theory, the
socalled mtheory [1]. in this respect, horava
and witten proposed that the strongcoupling
limit of e8  e8 heterotic string theory can be
obtained from mtheory. they used the low
energy limit of mtheory, eleven-dimensional su-
pergravity, on a manifold with boundary (a s1/z2
orbifold), with the e8 gauge multiplets at each of
the two tendimensional boundaries (the orbifold
xed planes) [2].

in the present paper i will summarize several
recent results concerning the fourdimensional

implications of this so called heterotic mtheory.
in particular, i will concentrate on the analysis of
the eective supergravity obtained by compact-
ifying heterotic mtheory on a sixdimensional
calabiyau manifold and its phenomenological
consequences.

the eective action of this limit has been sys-
tematically analyzed in an expansion in powers
of 2/3, where 2 denotes the elevendimensional
gravitational coupling [3]. as was noticed in [4],
this leads to an expansion parameter which scales
as 2/3/v 2/3, where  denotes the length of
the eleventh segment and v is the calabiyau
volume. at the leading order in this expansion,
the kahler potential, superpotential and gauge
kinetic functions have been computed in [4, 5, 6,
7]. it is rather easy to determine the order 1 cor-
rection to the leading order gauge kinetic func-
tions [4, 8, 7, 9], while it is much more nontrivial
to compute the order 1 correction to the lead-
ing order kahler potential, which was recently

done by lukas, ovrut and waldram [10]. it was
argued in [11] that the holomorphy and peccei
quinn symmetries guarantee that there is no fur-
ther correction to the gauge kinetic functions and
the superpotential at any nite order in the m
theory expansion, similarly to the case of the per-
turbative heterotic string [12].

on the other hand, as is well known, the
fourdimensional eective action of the weakly
coupled heterotic string theory can be expanded
in powers of the two dimensionless variables: the
string coupling s = e2/(2)5 and the world-
sheet sigmamodel coupling  = 4/v 1/3. it
was suggested in [11] that the eective action of
m-theory can be similarly analyzed by expand-
ing it in powers of the two dimensionless vari-
ables: 1 = 2/3/v 2/3 and 2 = 2/3/v 1/3.
the latter is the straightforward generalization of
the string worldsheet coupling  /v 1/3 to the
membrane worldvolume coupling  2/3/v 1/3
since 2/3 may be identied as the inverse of
the membrane tension. note that in the m
theory limit, heterotic string corresponds to a
membrane stretched along the eleventh dimen-
sion. in this framework the kahler potential is
expected to receive corrections which are higher
order in 1 or 2. an explicit computation of
these higher order corrections will be highly non-
trivial since rst of all the elevendimensional ac-
tion is known only up to the terms of order 2/3
relative to the zeroth order action (except for the
order 4/3 four-gaugino term) and secondly the
higher order computation of the compactication
solution and its kaluza-klein reduction are much
more complicated.

in section 2, we will provide a simple macro-
scopic analysis of the fourdimensional eective
supergravity action by expanding it in powers of
1 and 2. possible higher order corrections in the
kahler potential are identied and matched with
the heterotic string corrections, and their size is
estimated for the physically interesting values of
moduli [11]. the validity of this procedure has
been explicitly checked in [15] in the case of m
theory compactied on s1/z2  k3  t 2.
on the other hand, we will also discuss in
detail how these eective supergravity models
can be strongly constrained by imposing the phe-
nomenological requirement of universal soft scalar

masses, in order to avoid dangerous avour chang-
ing neutral current phenomena. as pointed out
in [13], there is a simple solution to avoid this
problem: to work with calabiyau spaces with
one kahler modulus t only. of course, the ex-
istence of such spaces, as e.g. the quintic hyper-
surface in cp 4, and their universality properties
was also known in the context of the weakly
coupled heterotic string, however the novel fact
in heterotic mtheory, is that model building is
relatively easy. for example, in the presence of
nonstandard embedding and vebranes (non
perturbative objects located at points through-
out the orbifold interval [3]) to obtain three
generation models with realistic gauge groups, as
for example su (5), is not specially dicult [14].
other phenomenological implications of het-
erotic mtheory, turn out to be also advanta-
geous with respect to the ones of the pertur-
bative heteroticstring theory. first of all, the
resulting fourdimensional eective theory can
reconcile the observed planck scale mp lanck =
1.2  1019 gev with the phenomenologically fa-
vored gut scale mgut  31016 gev in a nat-
ural manner, providing an attractive framework
for the unication of couplings [3, 4]. this is
to be compared to the weaklycoupled heterotic
string where mstring  8.5  1017 gev. another
phenomenological virtue of the mtheory limit
is that there can be a qcd axion whose high
energy axion potential is suppressed enough so
that the strong cp problem can be solved by the
axion mechanism [4, 8]. about the issue of su-
persymmetry breaking, the possibility of generat-
ing it by the gaugino condensation on the hidden
boundary has been studied [16, 7, 17, 18, 19, 20]
and also some interesting features of the result-
ing soft supersymmetrybreaking terms were dis-
cussed. in particular, gaugino masses turn out to
be of the same order as squark masses [7]. this
is welcome since gaugino masses much smaller
than squark masses, as in the weaklycoupled
heterotic string case, may give rise to a hierar-
chy problem [21]. for example, the experimental
lower bound on gluino masses of 150 gev would
imply scalar masses larger than 1 tev. besides,
the phenomenologically favored vacuum expecta-
tion values of the moduli can be obtained with
several gaugino condensates with the appropri-

ate hidden matter [20], similarly to the case of
the weaklycoupled heterotic string [22]. how-
ever, it is fair to say that unlike the latter non
perturbative membrane instantons are also nec-
essary in mtheory to obtain the desired mini-
mum.

several of the above mentioned phenomeno-
logical issues will be analyzed in the next sec-
tions. in section 3 we will concentrate in the case
of standard and nonstandard embedding vacua
[23, 24, 25, 26], whereas in section 4 vacua in the
presence of vebranes [26, 13] are studied. the
latter are characterized basically by new mod-
uli zn associated with the vebrane positions
in the orbifold dimension. in both cases we will
perform a detailed study of the dierent scales of
the theory, as well as a systematic analysis of the
soft supersymmetrybreaking terms.

concerning the former, the relations between
the elevendimensional planck mass, the calabi
yau compactication scale and the orbifold scale,
taking into account higher order corrections to
the leading order formulae, will be analyzed [27].
identifying the compactication scale with the
gut scale, to obtain mgut  3  1016 gev is
simpler in nonstandard embedding models than
in standard ones. in the presence of vebranes,
mgut can be obtained more easily. on the other
hand, going away from perturbative vacua, it was
recently realized that the string scale may be any-
where between the weak scale and the planck
scale [28] and the size of the extra dimensions
may be as large as a millimetre [29]. whether or
not all these scenarios1 are possible in the con-
text of heterotic mtheory has been analyzed re-
cently in [30] with interesting results: to lower
the unication scale (and therefore the eleven
dimensional planck scale which is around two
times bigger) to intermediate values  1011 gev
or 1 tev values or to obtain the radius of the orb-
ifold as large as a millimetre is in principle possi-
ble in some special limits. however, it has been
pointed out in [27] that the necessity of a ne
tuning or the existence of a hierarchy problem
renders these possibilities unnatural. although

1to trust them would imply to assume that nature
is trying to mislead us with an apparent gauge coupling
unication at mgu t . in this sense, a reasonable doubt
about those possibilities is healthy.

new possibilities arise in the presence of ve
branes in order to lower the scales, again at the
cost of introducing a huge hierarchy problem.

we will also analyze the soft supersymme-
try breaking terms under the general assumption
that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by
the auxiliary components of the bulk moduli su-
perelds (dilaton s and modulus t ) [11, 18, 31,
27].
it is examined in particular how the soft
terms vary when one moves from the weakly
coupled heterotic string limit to the strongly
coupled limit. the presence of new parameters
in the formulae gives rise to dierent pattern of
soft terms. this is also the case of models with
vebranes where at least a new goldstino angle,
associated to a modulus z1, must be included in
the computation [13, 32, 27]. unlike the weakly
coupled case, scalar masses larger than gaugino
masses can be obtained [27]. lowenergy (
mw ) sparticle spectra [33, 11, 34, 35, 27] are also
discussed.

finally, the existence of charge and colour
breaking minima is analyzed. as is well known,
the presence of scalar elds with colour and elec-
tric charge in supersymmetric theories induces
the possible existence of dangerous charge and
colour breaking minima, which would make the
standard vacuum unstable [36]. they impose
very strong constraints on supergravity models
from heterotic mtheory [37, 38].
in particu-
lar, standardembedding models turn out to be
excluded on these grounds, similarly to the per-
turbative heterotic-string situation [38]. possible
solutions to this problem are discussed.

2. fourdimensional eective super-

gravity

here we will analyze the fourdimensional ef-
fective supergravity obtained by compactifying
heterotic mtheory on a sixdimensional calabi
yau manifold.

2.1 expansions

let us rst discuss possible perturbative expan-
sions of the fourdimensional eective supergrav-
ity. as in the case of the weakly coupled heterotic
string theory, the eective supergravity of com-

with m11 denoting the elevendimensional planck

11 . the above normalizations of s
and t have been chosen to keep the conventional
form of the gauge kinetic functions in the eec-
tive supergravity. (see (2.6) for our form of the
gauge kinetic functions. our s and t correspond
to 1

4 s and 1
the moduli s and t can be used to dene
various kind of expansions which may be applied
for the lowenergy eective action. for instance,
in the weakly coupled heterotic string limit, we
have

here we are interested in the possible expansion
in the mtheory limit of the strong heterotic
11 and
11 and so the physics can be described by
elevendimensional supergravity. since we have
two independent length scales,  and v 1/6, there
can be two dimensionless expansion parameters
in the mtheory limit also. as discussed in the
introduction there are two natural candidates, 1
and 2, to be the expansion parameters of the
fourdimensional eective supergravity action of
the horava-witten mtheory. using 2 = m 9

 gut / which is essentially the four dimen-
sional eld theory expansion parameter. thus
if one goes to the limit in which one expansion
works better while keeping the realistic value of
gut , the other expansion becomes worse. here
we will simply assume that both 1 and 2 are
small enough so that the double expansion in 1
and 2 provides a good perturbative scheme for
the eective action of mtheory. as we will see
later, it turns out that this expansion works well
even when 1 becomes of order one, which is in
fact necessary to have mgut  3  1016 gev.
to be explicit, let us consider a simple com-
pactication on a calabi-yau manifold with the
hodge-betti number h1,1 = 1.
in this model,
the lowenergy degrees of freedom include rst
the gravity multiplet and s and t which are the
massless modes of the elevendimensional bulk
elds. we also have gauge and charged matter
superelds associated to the observable and hid-
den sector gauge groups, go  gh  e8  e8,
where go(gh ) is located at the boundary x11 =
0(x11 = ) with x11 denoting the orbifold coor-
dinate. from now on, we will use as our notation
the subscript o(h) for quantities and functions
of the observable(hidden) sector.

it is then easy to compute the kahler poten-
tial k, the observable and hidden sector gauge
kinetic functions fo and fh , and the superpo-
tential w at the leading order in the mtheory
expansion. obviously the leading contribution
to the moduli kahler metric is from the eleven
dimensional bulk eld action which is of order
2, while the charged matter kahler metric, the
gauge kinetic functions, and the charged matter
superpotential receive the leading contributions
from the tendimensional boundary action which
is of order 4/3. one nds [4, 5, 6, 7]

w = dpqrcpcqcr ,

(2.5)

where dpqr are constant coecients and cp are
the matter elds, i.e. the eective supergravity
computed at the leading order in the mtheory
expansion is the same as the eective supergrav-
ity of the weaklycoupled heterotic string com-
puted at the leading order in the string loop and
sigma model perturbation theory.

the holomorphy and the peccei-quinn sym-
metries imply that there is no correction to the
superpotential at any nite order in the s and
t dependent expansion parameters 1 and 2.
however the gauge kinetic functions can receive
a correction at order 1 in a way consistent with
the holomorphy and the peccei-quinn symme-
tries. this correction can be determined by a
direct mtheory computation [3] or by matching
the string loop threshold correction to the gauge
kinetic function [4, 8, 9, 7]. the result is

fo = s + ot ,

fh = s + h t ,

(2.6)

where the modeldependent integer coecients

2 tr(r r)],

ator of the integer (1,1) cohomology2, and they

(2.7)

with o always positive in the case of the stan-
dard embedding of the spin connection into one
of the e8 gauge groups. positive and negative
values are possible for nonstandard embedding
cases [24, 25, 26].

let us now consider the possible higher or-
der corrections to the kahler potential. with
the peccei-quinn symmetries, the kahler poten-
tial can be written as k = k(s + s, t + t ) +
z(s + s, t + t )cp cp with k = k0 +  k, z =
z0 + z. here k0 =  ln(s + s)  3 ln(t + t )
and z0 = 3/(t + t ) denote the leading order
results in (2.5), while  k and z are the higher
order corrections. before going to the mtheory
expansion of  k and z, it is useful to note that
the bulk physics become blind to the existence of

ber. for t normalized as (2.1), it is required to be an

boundaries in the limit   . however some of
the boundary physics, e.g. the boundary calabi-
yau volume, can be aected by the integral of the
bulk variables over the eleventh dimension and
then they can include a piece linear in  [3]. this
implies that  k/ k0, being the correction to the
pure bulk dynamics, contains only a non-negative
power of 1/ in the mtheory expansion, while
z/z0 which concerns the couplings between the
bulk and boundary elds can include a piece lin-
ear in . since n
2  nm, one needs m  n
for the expansion of  k/ k0 and m  n  1 for
the expansion of z/z0. taking account of these,
the mtheory expansion of the kahler potential
is given by [11]

the above expansion would work well in the

model expansions work well in the heterotic string
limit: re(s)  [42re(t )]3, re(t )  1
42 .
by varying re(s) while keeping re(t ) xed, one
can smoothly move from the mtheory limit s 
1 to the heterotic string limit s  1 (or vice
versa) while keeping 1  re(t )/re(s) and 2 
1/[42re(t )] small enough. obviously then the
mtheory kahler potential expanded in 1 and 2
remains to be valid over this procedure, and thus
is a valid expression of the kahler potential even
in the heterotic string limit. this means that,
like the case of the gauge kinetic functions, one
can determine the expansion coecients in (2.8)
by matching the heterotic string kahler potential
which can be computed in the string loop and
sigma model perturbation theory. since n

, (n, m)-th order in the mtheory expan-
sion corresponds to (n, m + 2n)-th order in the
string loop and sigma-model perturbation theory.
thus all the terms in the mtheory expansion
have their counterparts in the heterotic string ex-
pansion. it appears that the converse is not true
in general, for instance the term p
 with q < 2p
in the heterotic string expansion does not have
its counterpart in the mtheory expansion. how-
ever all string oneloop corrections which have
been computed so far lead to corrections which
scale (relative to the leading terms) as s2
 or
s3
, and thus have mtheory counterparts. this
leads us to suspect that all the terms that actu-
ally appear in the heterotic string expansion have
q  2p and thus have their counterparts in the
mtheory expansion. then there will be a com-
plete matching, up to (nonperturbative) correc-
tions which can not be taken into account by the
mtheory expansion, of the kahler potential be-
tween the mtheory limit and the heterotic string
limit, like the case of the gauge kinetic function
and superpotential. collecting available informa-
tions on the coecients in (2.8), either from the
heterotic string analysis or from the direct m
theory analysis (see [11] and references therein)
one obtains the following higher order corrections
to the leading order kahler potential in (2.5):

as a phenomenological application of the m
theory expansion discussed so far, we are going to
analyze in subsection 3.2 the soft supersymmetry
breaking terms under the assumption that super-
symmetry is spontaneously broken by the auxil-
iary components f s and f t of the moduli super-
elds s and t . we will see in subsection 3.1 how
moduli values of order one are necessary in or-
der to obtain mgut  3  1016 gev. clearly, if

6

re(t ) is of order one, we are in the mtheory
(see (2.3)). one may
domain with s  1.
worry that the mtheory expansion (2.8) would
not work in this case since 1 = re(t )/re(s)
is of order one also. however as we have no-
ticed, any correction which is n-th order in 1
accompanies at least (n  1)-powers of 2 and
thus is suppressed by (12)n1  (gut /)n1
compared to the order 1 correction. this al-
lows the mtheory expansion (2.8) to be valid
even when 1 becomes of order one. obviously
if re(t ) is of order one, only the order 1 cor-
rection to z, i.e. z = o/2re(s), can be siz-
able. the other corrections are suppressed by
either 12  1/42re(s) or 3
2  1/[42re(t )]3
and thus smaller than the leading order results
at least by o( gu t
). thus we will include only
z = o/2re(s) (z = h /2re(s) for hidden
matter) in the later analysis of soft terms, while
ignoring the other corrections to the kahler po-
tential

ing point of the phenomenological analyses in

2.2 universality of soft terms

nomenology associated to heterotic m-theory com-
pactied on a calabi-yau manifold one also should

consider in principle models with more than one
single t modulus. however, models with sev-
eral moduli ti has the potential problem of non
universal soft scalar masses [39]. the soft scalar
masses are given in general by m2
3/2zpq 
f m (mnzpq  z rsmzpsnzr q) f n [40], where
f m = f s, f ti in our case, and zpq and z pq de-
note the kahler metric and its inverse of the mat-
ter elds cp. for example, in the case of the stan-
dard embedding the kahler metric of the matter
elds ci is given by zij = (2 k t /ti tj)e k t /3
+zij(s+ s, tk + tk), where k t =  ln kijk(ti+
ti)(tj + tj)(tk + tk) and zij corresponds to
the s-dependent correction in the mtheory ex-
pansion (or the string-loop correction). after
normalizing the elds to get canonical kinetic
terms, although the rst piece in m2
ij above will
lead to universal diagonal soft masses, the second
piece will generically induce nonuniversal con-
tributions, as in the case of the weaklycoupled
limit of the heterotic string compactied on a
calabiyau [41], due to the presence of the o
diagonal kahler metric zij written above. this
clearly implies that the scalar mass eigenvalues
will be in general nondegenerate. if one ignores
zij, the matter kahler metric is s-independent
and, as a consequence, in the dilatondominated
[42, 43] scenario with f ti = 0 the normalized soft
scalar masses are universal as mi = m3/2. how-
ever including the s-dependent zij, one gener-
ically loses the scalar mass universality even in
the dilatondominated case [11].
in fact, this
was noted in [44] for the stringloop induced3
zij which is small in the weakly coupled het-
erotic string limit. the main point here is that
in the mtheory limit zij can be as large as the
leading order kahler metric, and then there can
be a large violation of the scalar mass universal-
ity even in the dilatondominated scenario [11].
an explicit computation of zij can be found
in [46]. clearly, multimoduli calabiyau mod-
els have the potential problem of nonuniversal
soft scalar masses. of course this can be ame-
liorated taking into account the lowenergy run-
ning of the scalar masses [43]. in particular, in
the squark case, for gluino masses heavier than

3it is worth noticing that supergravityloop correc-

tions may also induce non-universality [45].

(or of the same order as) the squark masses at
the boundary scale, there are large avour-inde-
pendent gluino loop contributions which are the
dominant source of squark masses. however, to
avoid the problem of nonuniversality from the
beginning would be welcome. as pointed out in
[13] there is the solution of working with calabi
yau spaces with one kahler modulus t (h1,1 =
1). clearly, supersymmetry breaking in the s
and/or t direction in this case will give rise to
universal soft terms4.

notice that this improvement with respect
to the problem of nonuniversality is not pos-
sible in other compactications. for example,
although in most orbifolds the structure of soft
scalar masses is simpler due to the existence of
p, still
3/2 +
(ti+ ti)2 |f ti|2 [47], due to the modular weight
dependence ni
p [48]. although the above formu-
lae are valid for the weaklycoupled case, the re-
sult about nonuniversality of soft terms is not
modied in the stronglycoupled case [11].

summarizing the above discussions, due to
the constraints that the universality of soft terms
impose on eective supergravity models, our start-
ing point for the phenomenological analyses in
the next section is the model given by (2.10),
(2.11) and (2.12), i.e. we will assume that the
standard model arises from heterotic mtheory
compactied on a calabiyau manifold with only
one modulus eld t .

3. phenomenology of standard and

nonstandard embedding vacua

here we will summarize rst results found in the
literature about the standard and nonstandard
embedding cases, and then we will discuss in de-
tail the issue of the scales in the theory as well
as the pattern of soft terms.

4although (2,1) complex structure moduli, up, may
contribute to the matter kahler metric with some u 
dependent metric hpq multiplying the third and forth
term in (2.10), they will not spoil the universality of soft
terms as long as they do not contribute to supersymmetry
breaking, f up = 0. i thank a. lukas and d. waldram

let us recall rst that the form of the eec-
tive action is determined by (2.10), (2.11) and
(2.12). this is also true for the nonstandard
embedding case although there is no requirement
that the spin connection be embedded in the
gauge connection [24, 25, 26]. taking into ac-
count that the real parts of the gauge kinetic
functions in (2.11) multiplied by 4 are the in-
verse gauge coupling constants o and h , using
(2.1) one can write [3, 5, 24]

or e6, i.e. we are using (2o)1 = 4 in order
to reproduce the lep data about gut (o in
our notation).

let us recall at this point that standard and
nonstandard embedding vacua full the condi-
tion (2.7). thus o = h in (2.13) implying
that the average volume of the calabiyau space
turns out to be equal to the lowest order value
< v >= v and as a consequence (3.2) and (3.4)
simplify. this will not be the case in the presence
of vebranes as we will see in the next section.

due also to eq.(2.7) the following bounds

planck scale m 2

< v > is the average volume of the calabiyau
space < v >= (vo + vh )/2, and (2.1) one nds

which is a very useful formula as we will see be-
low in order to discuss whether or not the gut
scale or smaller scales are obtained in a natural
way. in this respect, let us now obtain the con-
nection between the dierent scales of the theory:
the elevendimensional planck mass, m11, the
calabiyau compactication scale, v 1/6
, and
the orbifold scale, ()1. it is straightforward
to obtain from (3.1) the following relation:

o

1 < o < 1 ,

(3.5)

must be fullled in order to have positive val-
ues for vo and vh . besides, o > 0 will im-
ply that vo be larger than vh and therefore the
gauge coupling of the observable sector will be
weaker than the gauge coupling of the hidden
sector (see(3.1)). the opposite situation o <
0 may be obtained in nonstandard embedding
models. vo is now smaller than vh and therefore
the gauge coupling of the observable sector will
be stronger than the one of the hidden sector5.
notice that using (2.11) one can write o as

o =

4  (s + s)
(s + s)

,

(3.6)

where (2o)1 = 4 has been used. thus with
(3.5) and (2.13) one obtains that the dilaton and
moduli elds are bounded. in particular,

0 < o(t + t ) < 2 ,

2 < (s + s) < 4 , (3.7)

for 0 < o < 1 and

likewise, using the above expression for mp lanck

(s + s) > 4 ,

for 1 < o < 0. note that o can approach the
limit 1 only for very large values of (s + s) and
therefore of (t + t ).

with all these results we can start now the

study of scales and soft terms in the theory.

notice that in (3.3) and (3.4) we have already
assumed that the gauge group of the observable
sector go is the one of the standard model or
some unication gauge group as su (5), so(10)

5in the context of supersymmetry breaking by gaugino
condensation this scenario may have several advantageous
features with respect to scenarios with o > 0. for a
discussion about this point see [25].

3.1 scales

we will discuss rst how to obtain mgut = 3 
1016 gev in the fourdimensional eective the-
ory from heterotic mtheory [3, 4] taking into ac-
count the higher order corrections studied above
to the zerothorder formulae [27]. on the other
hand, we will analyze whether the special limits
pointed out in [30], in order to lower the scales of
the theory, even with the possibility of obtaining
an extra dimension as large as a millimetre, may
be obtained in a natural way [27].

o

let us concentrate rst in the case o > 0,
i.e. in the region 0 < o < 1 in (3.5). identifying
mgut with v 1/6
one obtains from (3.4), and
(3.3) (recall that < v >= v ): m11  6  1016
gev and ()1  (2.5  5.3)  1015 gev, i.e.
the following pattern ()1 < v 1/6
< m11.
on the other hand, to obtain v 1/6
= mgut
when o > 0 is quite natural. this can be seen
from (3.2) since (3.7) implies that t + t and s+ s
are essentially of order one. let us discuss this
point in more detail. using (2.13) and (3.6) it is
interesting to write (3.2) as

o

o

v 1/6
o

2o(cid:19)1/2
= 3.6  1016(cid:18) o
 (1 + o)5/6 gev .
this is shown in fig. 1 where v 1/6
versus o is
plotted. the r.h.s. of the gure (0 < o < 1)
corresponds to the case o > 0 whereas the l.h.s.

(3.9)

o

9

(1 < o < 0) corresponds to the case o < 0
that will be analyzed below. for the moment we
concentrate on the case o > 0 and, in partic-
ular, in fig. 1 we are showing an example with
o = 1. ()1 and m11 are also plotted in the
gure using (3.4) and (3.3) respectively. most
values of o imply v 1/6
 51016 which is quite
close to the phenomenologically favored value.
for example, for o = 1/4, which corresponds
to s + s = 16/5 and t + t = 4/5, we obtain
v 1/6
= 6.1 1016 gev and for the limit o = 1
o
(as discussed in subsection 2.1, the mtheory ex-
pansion will work even in this limit), which cor-
responds to s + s = t + t = 2, we obtain the
lowest possible value v 1/6

o

o

= 4.5  1016.

o

these qualitative results can only be mod-
(t + t )  0,
ied in the limit o  0, i.e.
since then v 1/6
o  . notice that in this case
()1 > v 1/6
(see fig. 1). this limit is not
interesting not only because v 1/6
is too large
but also because we are eectively in the weakly
coupled region with a very small orbifold radius.
the results for o > 1 can easily be deduced
from the gure and eq.(3.9). for those models we
are in the limit of validity if we want to obtain
v 1/6
= mgut . for example, for o = 1 with
o
o = 4, v 1/6

o

= 9  1016 gev.

let us nally remark that, from the above
discussion, it is straightforward to deduce that
large internal dimensions, associated with the ra-
dius of the calabiyau and/or the radius of the
orbifold, are not allowed.

o

o

let us now study the value of the scales in
models with o < 0. we can use again (3.9),
but now with 1 < o < 0. this is shown in the
l.h.s. of the fig. 1. unlike the previous models
where always v 1/6
was bigger than mgut for
any o > 0, in these nonstandard embedding
models mgut can be obtained. for example in
the case shown in the gure, o = 1, with o =
0.35 which, using (3.6) and (2.13), corresponds
to s + s = 6.15 and t + t = 2.15, we obtain
v 1/6
= 31016 gev. for other values of o this
o
is also possible. notice that the gure for v 1/6
will be the same adding the constant log |o|1/2
and therefore there will be lines, corresponding
to v 1/6
, intersecting with the straight line cor-
responding to mgut . in this sense, if we want

o

o

corfu summer institute on elementary particle physics, 1998

carlos munoz

to obtain models with the phenomenologically fa-
vored gut scale, nonstandard embedding mod-
els with o < 0 are more compelling than models
with o > 0.

o

o

o

on the other hand, for o > 0 we obtained
above the lower bound  1016 gev for all scales
of the theory (see the r.h.s. of fig. 1), far away
from any direct experimental detection. now we
want to study this issue in cases with o < 0.
from (3.9), clearly in the limit o  1 we are
able to obtain v 1/6
o  0 and therefore, given
(3.4) also ()1  0 (see the l.h.s.of fig. 1).
thus to lower the scale v 1/6
down to the exper-
imental bound (due to kaluzaklein excitations)
of 1 tev is possible in this limit. however, this is
true only for values of o extremely close to 1.
for example, for o = 0.999999 which, using
(3.6) and (2.13), corresponds to s + s = 4  106
and t + t = 4  106  4, we obtain the in-
termediate scale v 1/6
= 2.5  1011 gev, i.e.
m11 = 51011 gev, with ()1 = 3106 gev.
this is an interesting possibility since an inter-
mediate scale  1011 gev was proposed in [30] in
order to solve some phenomenological problems
and in [49] in order to solve the mw /mp lanck
hierarchy problem6.
in any case, it is obvious
that the smaller the scale the larger the amount
of netuning becomes. the experimental lower
bound for the scale v 1/6
, 1 tev, can be ob-
tained with o = 1016 1, i.e. s + s = 4 1016
and t + t = 410164. then one gets v 1/6
=
1181.5 gev with ()1 = 3.2109 gev. since
only gravity is free to propagate in the orbifold,
this extremely small value is not a problem from
the experimental point of view. in any case, it
is clear that low scales are possible but the ne
tuning needed renders the situation highly un-
natural. another problem related with the limit
o  1 will be found below when studying soft
6for example, for a d3brane in type i strings where
mw
, with a modest input hierarchy
mp lanck
between string and compactication scales, mi  1011
gev and mc  109 gev, one obtains the desired hi-
erarchy mw /mp lanck  1016 without invoking any
hierarchically suppressed nonperturbative eect like e.g.
gaugino condensation. however, it is worth noticing that
those values would imply re(s) = 1/o  24 and
re(t ) = 1
 109, i.e. one has again a hier-
archy problem but now for the vev of the elds that one
has to determine dynamically.

small gravitino mass is needed to ne tune the
gaugino mass m to the 1 tev scale in order to
avoid the gauge hierarchy problem.

there is a value of o which is in principle
allowed and has not been analyzed yet. this is
the case o = 0. as we will see in a moment,
to lower the scales a lot in this context is again
possible. since o in (2.13) is vanishing and using
(3.6), s + s = 4, eq. (3.2) can be written as

the smaller v 1/6

()1 = 1013 gev. smaller values of v 1/6
are not allowed since experimental results on the
force of gravity constrain () to be less than a
millimetre. thus, although very low scales are
allowed for the particular value o = 0, clearly
we introduce a hierarchy problem between s + s
and t + t .

play the predominant role in the process of super-

7unlike [18] where only linear terms in 1 are kept,
we keep all contributions to soft terms avoiding acciden-
tal cancellations at linear order, e.g.
in scalar masses.
higher order terms in (2.10) might modify the higher or-
der contributions but, as argued in subsection 2.1 these
terms will be suppressed.

as mentioned in the introduction, the struc-
ture of these soft terms is qualitatively dierent
from that of a calabiyau compactication of
the (treelevel) weaklycoupled heterotic string
found in [43] which can be recovered from (3.11)
by taking the limit (t + t )  (s + s),
i.e.
o  0:

a = m = 3m = 3m3/2 sin  .

(3.12)

clearly the mtheory result (3.11) is more in-
volved due to the additional dependence on o.
nevertheless we can simplify the analysis by tak-
ing into account the bounds (3.5).

we show in fig. 3 the dependence on  of
the soft terms m , m, and a in units of the grav-
itino mass for dierent values of o [11, 31, 27].
several comments are in order. first of all, some
ranges of  are forbidden by having a negative
scalar mass-squared. in the weaklycoupled het-
erotic string case shown in fig. 4, the forbidden
region vanishes since the squared scalar masses
are always positive (see (3.12)). about the pos-
sible range of soft terms, the smaller the value
of o, the larger the range becomes. in the limit
o  1, 0.3 < |a|/m3/2 < 4.58, 0 < m/m3/2 <

2.26 and |m|  .

in order to discuss the supersymmetric spec-
tra further, it is worth noticing that gaugino mas-
ses are in general larger than scalar masses. this
implies at lowenergy ( mw ) the following qual-
itative result [11]: mg  mq > ml, where g de-
note the gluino, l all the sleptons and q rst and
second generation squarks. other analyses tak-
ing into account the details of the electroweak
radiative breaking can be found in [34, 35]. only
for values of o approaching 1 the opposite sit-
uation, scalars heavier than gauginos, may occur.
this is for two narrow ranges of values of  as can
be seen in fig. 3 for o = 3/5. let us remark
that m/m3/2 and m/m3/2 are then very small
and therefore m3/2 must be large in order to ful-
l e.g. the lowenergy bounds on gluino masses.
in this special limits m  m is possible and then
mg < mq  ml [27].

notice that in the (treelevel) weaklycoupled
heterotic string, the limit sin   0 is not well
dened since all m , a, m vanish in that limit.
one then has to include the string oneloop cor-
rections (or the sigmamodel corrections) to the
kahler potential and gauge kinetic functions which
would modify the boundary conditions (3.12).
this is similar to what happens in orbifold com-
pactications where, at the end of the day, scalars
are heavier than gauginos due to string loop cor-
rections [43]. this problem is not present in
the heterotic mtheory, as can be deduced from
fig. 3, except in models with o = 0, i.e. o = 0
and therefore with boundary conditions (3.12).

3.3 charge and colour breaking

we discussed in subsection 2.2 how eective su-
pergravity models from heterotic mtheory can

be strongly constrained by imposing the (experi-
mental) requirement of universal soft scalar mass-
es, in order to avoid dangerous avour changing
neutral current phenomena. we can go further
and impose the (theoretical) constraint of de-
manding the no existence of lowenergy charge
and colour breaking minima deeper than the stan-
dard vacuum [36]. in this type of analysis, the
form of the soft terms is crucial. in the case of the
standard embedding, 0 < o < 1, with soft terms
given by (3.11) the restrictions are very strong
and the whole parameter space (m3/2, , o, b)
turns out to be excluded on these grounds [37,
38]. this is shown in fig. 5 [38] for a xed value
of m3/2 (or, equivalently, of m) with o = 1.
then we are left with two independent param-
eters b and . whereas the black region is ex-
cluded because it is not possible to reproduce the
experimental mass of the top, the rest is excluded
by charge and colour breaking constraints. the
small squares indicate regions excluded by the
socalled ufb constraints and the circles indi-
cate regions excluded by the socalled ccb con-
straints. other values for m and o do not mod-
ify these conclusions.

given these dramatic consequences, a way
out must be searched8 [51]. the rst possibility
is to consider the case of the nonstandard em-
bedding since although the formulae for the soft

8we could accept that we live in a metastable vacuum,
provided its lifetime is longer than the present age of the
universe, thus rescuing points in the parameter space [36].
in this sense the constraints found are basically the most
conservative ones (in the sense of safe ones).

terms are the same (3.11) the parameter space
is dierent: 1 < o < 0. another possible
wayout is to consider the presence of vebranes
in the vacuum, then the soft terms are dierent
(see(4.2)) and new parameters, as e.g. the gold-
stino angles n associated with f terms of the
vebranes, enter in the game. possibly some
regions in the parameter space will be allowed.
although now the situation is clearly more model
dependent.

it is worth noticing that the situation in the
perturbative heterotic string compactied on a
calabiyau is basically worst. there the whole
parameter space (m3/2, , b) is forbidden [38] and
there is no the freedom of playing around with
o and/or n from vebranes. only in the limit
sin   0, where one has to include loop cor-
rections to the boundary conditions (3.12), small
regions might be allowed. at least this is the
case of orbifold compactications with the same
boundary conditions (i.e. models where all ob-
servable particles have modular weight 1) [38].

4. vacua with ve-branes

in the previous section, we studied the phenome-
nology of heterotic mtheory vacua obtained thro-
ugh standard and nonstandard embedding. here
we want to analyze (nonperturbative) heterotic
mtheory vacua due to the presence of vebranes.

4.1 fourdimensional eective supergrav-

ity

as mentioned in the introduction, vebranes
are nonperturbative objects, located at points,
x11 = xn(n = 1, ..., n ), throughout the orb-
ifold interval. the modications to the four
dimensional eective action determined by (2.10),
(2.11) and (2.12), due to their presence, have
recently been investigated by lukas, ovrut and
waldram [26, 13]. basically, they are due to the
existence of moduli, zn, whose re(zn)  zn =
xn/  (0, 1) are the vebrane positions in the
normalized orbifold coordinates. then, the ef-
fective supergravity obtained from heterotic m
theory compactied on a calabiyau manifold in
the presence of vebranes is now determined by

n=1(1

h the instanton numbers and n the vebrane
charges. the former, instead of condition (2.7),

n=1(1  zn)2n, bo = o +pn

must full now: o +pn

n=1 n + h = 0.

4.2 phenomenology

assuming for simplicity that < zn >=< zn >,
i.e. < bo >=< bo >, (3.1) is still valid with the
t + t
modication o,h  eo,h, where eh = bh
s+ s
with bh = h + pn
n=1(zn)2n. following the
analysis of section 3 one can write eo as a func-
tion of s + s as in (3.6) and therefore the bounds
for s + s in (3.7) and (3.8) are still valid if
1 < eo < 1 is possible. in fact one can obtain
dierent bounds on eo depending on the sign of
both bo and bh [27]. for example, if bh  0
and bo  0, then eh is positive and eo nega-
tive. since vo = v (1 + eo) must be positive we
need 1 < eo  0. another example is the case
bh  0 and bo > 0. now since eo is positive
vo will always be positive and therefore the only
bound is eo > 0. it is worth noticing that the
values 0 < (s + s) < 2, corresponding to eo > 1
are then possible. this was not the case in the
absence of vebranes since o > 1 was not al-
lowed.

4.2.1 scales

v

bo(cid:17)i1

2 (cid:16)1 + bh

in the presence of vebranes v =< v > as in
section 3 is no longer true since vo,h = v (1 +
eo,h ) with eo + eh 6= 0 in general. therefore
<v > = h1 + eo
and the relevant
formulae to study the relation between the dif-
ferent scales of the theory are (3.2) and (3.4) with
the modication o  eo. notice that (3.3) is
not modied. similarly to the case without ve
branes, to obtain v 1/6
 3  1016 gev when
t + t and s + s are of order one is quite natural.
to carry out the numerical analysis we can use

now for large t we have a factor (t + t )1 and
then not so large values of t + t as in fig. 2
are needed in order to lower the scales. for ex-
ample, if bh = 1 then v 1/6

obtained for t + t = 1014 with the size of the
orbifold ()1 = 5  1012 gev close to its ex-
perimental bound of 1 millimetre. in any case,
still a large hierarchy between s + s and t + t
is needed.

sidered in [27]. although the qualitative results
are similar to those of fig. 1 with eo instead of
o, now the line corresponding to v 1/6
in the
r.h.s. of the gure may intersect the straight line
corresponding to the gut scale. of course this
eect, which is due essentially to the extra factor
discussed above, is welcome.

only in some special limits one may lower the
scales. as in the case without vebranes, ne

o

tuning eo  1 we are able to obtain v 1/6

as low as we wish. the numerical results will
be basically similar to the ones of subsection 3.1.
moreover, as discussed above, eo > 1 is possi-
ble in the presence of vebranes and therefore
with eo suciently large we may get v 1/6
very
small. this is shown in fig. 6 for the example
bo = bh = 1/2. for instance, with log eo = 56.1
the experimental lower bound ()1 = 1013
gev is obtained for v 1/6
= 8 106 gev, corre-
sponding to s + s = 3.1  1056 and t + t = 8.
clearly we introduce a hierarchy problem.

finally, the analysis of the special case bo =
0 will be similar to the one of the case o = 0
without vebranes in subsection 3.1. we can
use (3.10) with the average volume [1 + bh (t +
t )/8]1/2 multiplying the r.h.s. depending on
the value of bh we obtain dierent results [27].
for example if bh > 0 the results are qualita-
tively similar to those of fig. 2, the larger t + t
the smaller v 1/6
becomes. however, notice that

let us now concentrate on the computation of
soft terms [13, 32, 27]. due to the possible con-
tribution of several f terms associated with ve
branes, which can have in principle odiagonal
kahler metrics, the computation of the soft terms
turns out to be extremely involved. in order to
get an idea of their value and also to study the
deviations with respect to the case without ve
branes we can do some simplications. one pos-
sibility is to assume that vebranes are present
but only the f terms associated with the dila-
ton and the modulus contribute to supersymme-
try breaking, i.e. f zn = 0. then, assuming as
before < zn >=< zn >, eq.(3.11) is still valid
with eo instead of o. under these simplifying
assumptions, fig. 3 is also valid in this case since,
as discussed above, the range of allowed values of
eo includes those of o, i.e. 1 < eo < 1. the
relevant dierence with respect to the case with-
out vebranes is that now values with eo  1
are allowed. this possibility was studied in [27].
although the soft terms are qualitatively dier-
ent from those without vebranes analyzed in
fig. 3, the fact that always scalar masses are
smaller than gaugino masses is still true for eo 
1. as discussed below (3.12), we will obtain at
lowenergies, mg  mq > ml.

another possibility to simplify the computa-
tion of the soft terms is to assume that there is
only one vebrane in the model. for example,
parameterizing f s = 3m3/2(s + s) sin  cos 1,
f t = m3/2(t + t ) cos  cos 1, f z1 = 3m3/2
(11k5)1/2sin1, where 1 is the new goldstino
angle associated to the f term of the vebrane,
one obtains [32, 27].

the formula for the b parameter can be found
in [27]. unfortunately, the numerical analysis of
this simplied case is not straightforward. all
soft terms depend not only on the new gold-
stino angle 1 in addition to m3/2,  and eo,
but also on other free parameters. for exam-
ple, although gaugino masses can be further sim-
plied with the assumption < zn >=< zn >,
i.e. < bo >=< bo >=< bo > (and therefore
(bot + bo t )/(s+ s) = eo), and < t >=< t >
(and therefore 2t /(s + s) = eo/bo), still they
have an explicit dependence on z1 and 11k5.
notice that, for a given model, o and 1 are
known and therefore bo can be computed once
z1 is xed. something similar occurs for the a
parameter, where z1, 1k5 and 11k5 appear
explicitly, and for the scalar masses, where z1 and
11k5 also appear. thus in order to compute
soft terms when a vebrane is present and con-
tributing to supersymmetry breaking we have to
input these values. fortunately, z1 is in the range
0 < z1 < 1 and, although k5 is not known, since
it depends on z1, we expect 1k5, 11k5 =
o(1). so we can consider the following represen-
tative case: z1 = 1/2 and 1k5 = 11k5 = 1.
since, still we have to input the value of bo, we

choose an example with o = 1 and 1 = 2
which implies bo = bh = 1/2. then all positive
values of eo are allowed. we show in fig. 7 the
soft terms for the value eo = 3/5 with 1 = /3.
unlike fig. 3 without vebranes, we see now a
remarkable fact: scalar masses larger than gaug-
ino masses can easily be obtained. this happens
not only for narrow ranges of . for example, for
eo = 1/3 and 1 = /3,   3/2 one obtains
m/|m|  10. this result implies a relation of the
type ml  mq  3.5mg. an exhaustive analysis
of other examples can be found in [27].
