abstract

we derive the complete set of supersymmetric ward identities involv-
ing only two- and three- point proper vertices in supersymmetric qed.
we also present the most general form of the proper vertices consistent
with both the supersymmetric and u (1) gauge ward identities. these
vertices are the supersymmetric equivalent of the non supersymmetric
ball-chiu vertices.

1 introduction

while supersymmetry (susy) is generally agreed to be integral to any theory
incorporating both gravity and gauge forces, techniques for investigating non-
perturbative eects such as chiral symmetry breaking are still in their early
stages. a small number of authors have employed dyson schwinger equa-
tions (dses) to analyse various susy theories 1,2,3,4 and small inroads into
numerical solutions 5 of the susy dse (sdse) in supersymmetric quantum
electrodynamics (sqed) in 2+1 dimensions (sqed3) have been made.

analyses of susy theories generally use the rainbow approximation to
truncate the dses at a manageable level. one exception is clark and love who
use the supereld formalism and derive a dierential u (1) gauge ward identity
for the superelds. they nd that the eective mass contains a prefactor which
vanishes in feynman gauge and conclude that there can be no spontaneous
mass generation in sqed, even beyond the rainbow approximation. however
the supereld approach suers the disadvantage that each dse contains an
innite number of terms. this is dealt with by truncating diagrams containing
seagull and higher order n-point vertices.

the work of clark and love has been criticized by kaiser and selipsky
on two grounds 6. firstly they argue that the truncation of seagull diagrams
is too severe as it ignores contributions even at the one-loop level. secondly
they point out that innities arising from infrared divergences which plague the
supereld formalism can counter the vanishing prefactor and allow spontaneous
mass generation. these criticisms highlight some of the dangers of attempting

1

to extract phenomenological consequences of supersymmetric dses by working
in fact, analyses in the literature 4,5
solely with the supereld formalism.
have generally found the component formalism to be the most ecient way to
proceed.

koopmans and steringa 3, using the component formalism, also sought to
be consistent with the dierential u (1) gauge wi in their analysis of sqed3
with two-component fermions. to this end they multiplied the bare vertices by
a(q2) where the electron propagator is given by s1(q) = i( qa(q2)+b(q2)).
this approach is questionable as it implicitly approximates the functions a(p2)
and b(p2) as being at. while this approximation is reasonable over most of
the momentum range, it is not valid in the low momentum limit where the
dynamics are largely determined.

attempts to go beyond the rainbow approximation in non-susy theories
began with the ball and chiu7 vertex ansatze for qed and qcd. these are the
minimal vertices which solve the ward takahashi identities (wtis) while
avoiding kinematic singularities. ball and chiu also gave the general form
of the possible transverse pieces which may be added. since then several
authors have sought to construct ansatze which improve on the minimal ball-
chiu vertex 8,9.

that analogous progress has not been made in sqed using the component
formalism is not suprising. not only must the gauge particle vertices be dressed
but the gaugino vertices also. indeed substituting the minimal ball and chiu
vertex for photon interactions in sqed3 while leaving the other vertices bare
exacerbates the sdses gauge violating properties 5. the problem of going
beyond the rainbow approximation in susy theories is the problem of nding
the gaugino vertices corresponding to the improved photon vertex. gaugino
vertices are not constrained by the wti since the gaugino is invariant to gauge
transformations. however they are related to the gauge particle vertices by
susy ward identities (swis). it is the purpose of this paper to derive and
solve the swis for sqed and obtain the most general form of the three-point
vertex functions consistent with both susy and u (1) gauge ward identities.

sec.2 gives the swis between the various two-point functions of sqed
and their solution which is unique once the electron propagator is known.
sec.3 shows how to treat proper functions of auxiliary elds. sec.4 gives the
swis constraining the three-point proper functions and nds that the rainbow
approximation violates susy. the most general form of the vertices consistent
with these identities is presented in sec.5 and proven to be so in appendix a.

is, by construction, invariant with respect to both u (1) gauge transformations
and susy transformations where the susy transformations are given by 10

sa = i,
sb = 5,

s = [f + i5g + i  (a + i5b)  e  a(a  i5b)],

(2.2)

sf = [   + e[a  ib5 + i  a]],

sg = i[5   + e[5  ib  i  a5]],

for the chiral multiplet and

sa = ,

s = a  + i5d,

sd = i5  ,

for the vector multiplet.
it is important to note that the transformations
in eqn.(2.2) are not true susy transformations but susy transformations
plus a gauge transformation. this is a manifestation of the wess-zumino
(wz) gauge which is used to make the lagrangian polynomial 10. a true
susy transformation spoils the wz gauge and must be followed by a gauge

3

transformation which restores it for the lagrangian to be invariant. it is from
this invariance that the swis arise.

the swis completely specify the selectron propagators in terms of the elec-
tron propagator 11. the swis relating the scalar propagators to the electron
propagator 11 are

h i = ihaf i  i  phaai = ihbgi  i  phbbi,

(2.3)

and

  ph i = ihf f i + i  phf ai = ihggi + i  phgbi.

(2.4)

substituting in the fermion propagator

s(p)  h i =

i

  pa(p2) + b(p2)

,

(2.5)

gives the scalar propagators

d(p2)  haai = hbbi =

swis hold between proper vertices too of course. taking  to be the

(2.10)

to be

aa(p) = bb(p) = p2a(p2),
af (p) = f a(p) = bg(p) = gb(p) = b(p2),
f f (p) = gg(p) = a(p2).

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

it is interesting that aa(p) = bb(p) 6= d(p2)1. this can be attributed to
the presence of the auxiliary elds f and g. the treatment of proper functions
involving selectrons is discussed in the next section.

3 handling the proper functions of auxiliary fields

one of the diculties of the component notation in sqed is that of dealing
with the auxiliary elds f, g and d. the rst two are particularly dicult as
they contribute o-diagonal quadratic terms which give the scalar propagators
an unfamiliar form. to make the free eld theory manifestly gaussian we
dene,

[a] (cid:18) a
f(cid:19) ,
[b] (cid:18) b
g(cid:19) ,
[a] (cid:0) a f (cid:1) ,
[b] (cid:0) b g(cid:1) .
m 1 (cid:21) [a] + [b](cid:20) 2 m

the lagrangian becomes

and the problem of interpreting auxiliary elds is therefore side-stepped.

we shall denote the propagators or proper vertices involving [a] or [b] by
enclosing them in square brackets to distinguish them from the propagators
or vertices of the single component elds a, b, f and g. thus the [a] and [b]
propagators are

their photon interaction is

[(a,b)a(a,b)](p, q) (cid:20) (a,b)a(a,b)(p, q) (a,b)a(f,g)(p, q)
(f,g)a(a,b)(p, q) (f,g)a(f,g)(p, q)(cid:21) ;

the photino interactions are

[(a,b)](p, q)  [ (a,b)(p, q) (f,g) (p, q) ],

and

[ (a,b)](p, q) (cid:20)  (a,b)(p, q)
 (f,g)(p, q)(cid:21) ;

and their d interactions are

(f,g)a(b,a)(p, q) (f,g)a(g,f )(p, q)(cid:21) .
[(a,b)d(b,a)](p, q) (cid:20) (a,b)d(b,a)(p, q) (a,b)a(g,f )(p, q)

one readily checks that eqs.(2.11) to (2.13) are consistent with

[(a,b)(a,b)](p) (cid:20) (a,b)(a,b)(p) (a,b)(f,g)(p)

(f,g)(a,b)(p) (f,g)(f,g)(p)(cid:21) = [d(p2)]1.

a(q, p) + d(p  q)[ 1 0 ][d(q)][a](q, p)},

(3.12)

where d is the photon propagator, and d the photino propagator.

4 supersymmetric vertex ward identities

before we can nd the vertices to substitute into the sdse, we need the swis
which constrain them. these are found by taking functional derivatives of
s = 0 where  is the eective action and s is dened in eqn.(2.2). the
functional derivatives of s = 0 corresponding to the following swis are given
in table 1:

aaa(p, q)


= a(p, q)  q + e(b(p2)  b(q2)) + a(q, p)  p,

it follows from both (4.9) and (4.10) that the rainbow approximation, that is,
dressed vertices replaced by bare vertices, violates susy in the same way that
it violates u (1) gauge invariance.

these make up the entire set of swis containing only three-or-fewer point
proper functions, modulo charge conjugation. a suitable vertex ansatz must
also be consistent with the wtis;

5 solution to swis and wtis in sqed

below is a solution for the swis and wtis.
it is the most general set of
vertices consistent with both the wtis and the swis and free of kinematic
singularities if one assumes charge conjugation invariance and

[aaa](p, q) = [bab](p, q).

(5.1)

proof of this is presented in appendix a. the assumption of eqn.(5.1) is true
to all orders in perturbation theory, and any nonperturbative violations of this
assumption are restricted by the wtis to lie completely within their transverse
components.

our general solution is as follows:

6 conclusion

we have derived the three-point swis for sqed and found a solution, given in
sections 2 and 5, which, under the reasonable assumptions of charge conjuga-
tion invariance and symmetry between [a] and [b] with respect to their photon
interaction, comprises the most general set of vertices consistent with both
the swis and wtis and free of kinematic singularities. they are, in fact, the
susy equivalent of the ball-chiu vertex. these susy ball-chiu vertices have
only three degrees of freedom between them once the electron propagator is
known, compared with non susy qed which has eight. the loss of degrees of
freedom occurs entirely within the electron-photon vertex. the scalar-photon
vertices remain unchanged from non susy scalar qed (with auxiliary elds).
we have given the form of the electron dse. there is no need to consider
also the dse for scalar partners since swis ensure that the propagators of all

12

chiral multiplet elds can be written in terms of the same two scalar functions
a(p2) and b(p2) (see sec.(2)). solving the dse for any chiral multiplet eld
can therefore be accomplished by projecting from the electron dse a pair of
coupled integral equations for a(p2) and b(p2).

numerical solutions of the analogous calculation in non susy qed12,13,14,15

16,17 using the minimal ball-chiu and curtis-pennington 8 vertex
and qed3
ansatze exist in the literature. the same task in susy is conceptually simi-
lar and the presence of extra terms in the dse is not expected to reduce its
feasibility. indeed such numerical work has been done already in the rainbow
5. the way now lies open to transcend the rainbow
approximation in sqed3
approximation in the analysis of sqed and sqed3 in the nonperturbative
limit.

a appendix: derivation of the nonperturbative vertices

below is a derivation of the most general form of the proper vertices consistent
with both the swis and the wtis. it is convenient to dene the following
notation:

the operator  performs the interchange (p, q)  (q, p).
a function f (p, q), invariant to , is written as f ((p, q)). if f (p, q) is a

scalar function f (p2, q2, p  q) then it is written as f ((p2, q2
alternately, a function g(p, q) which changes sign under  is written as g([p, q]),
or g([p2, q2

] , p  q) if it is scalar.

) , p  q).

eqs.(5.2, 5.3, 5.4) follow, by the reasoning of ball and chiu 7, from the

wti for [a] and [b] (see eqn.(4.26)).

substituting eqn.(5.1) into eqn.(4.10) and comparing to eqn.(4.9) gives

similarly, from eqs.(4.7, 4.8),

b(p, q) = i5a(p, q).

g(p, q) = i5f (p, q).

(a.1)

(a.2)

any f (p, q) consistent with eqn.(4.5) can be put in the general form

f (p, q) =

e
p2  q2 (a(p2)  a(q2))  q + h((p, q))
1

2

e[  p(q2  p  q) +   q(p2  p  q)]tf f ((p2, q2

) , p  q).

(a.3)

using eqn.(a.1) to equate eqs.(4.16, 4.17), we nd that

f db(p, q) = gda(p, q),
f dg(p, q) = gdf (p, q).

(a.4)

(a.5)

we obtain, by substituting eqs.(a.2, a.3) into eqn.(4.25),

5(  p    q)g df (p2, q2, p  q)

(a.6)

=

ie
p2  q2 (a(p2)  a(q2))5(  p    q) + ih((p, q))5  i5h((p, q)).

dividing h((p, q)) into its odd-numbered and even-numbered -matrix compo-
nents, h odd((p, q)) and h even((p, q)) respectively, we see from eqn.(a.6) that
h odd((p, q)) is of the form

h odd((p, q)) = (  p    q)

h ((p2, q2

) , p  q),



(a.7)

due to its anti-commutation with 5 and its invariance under . if we substi-
tute eqs.(a.2, a.4, 4.28) into eqn.(4.20) we get

5(  p    q)bdf (p2, q2, p  q)
= ia(p, q)5  ie5a(q2)  i5f (q, p)  p,

(a.8)

which, when added to eqn.(4.21), produces

i5a(p, q) + ia(p, q)5
= 2iea(q2) + i5f (q, p)  p  if (q, p)5  p.

(a.9)

any a(p, q) consistent with eqs.(a.3, a.7, a.9) must be of the form

a(p, q) =

(a.10)

h ((p2, q2

) , p  q) + odd

a(p, q),

where the superscript odd on the last term denotes that it is the component
of a(p, q) with only odd numbers of -matrices. odd
a(p, q) is unrestricted
by eqn.(a.9) due to its anti-commutation with 5.

substituting eqs.(5.2, a.10) into eqn.(4.1) tells us that



h ((p2, q2

) , p  q) =

1
2

e(taa((p2, q2

) , p  q)  p  qtf f ((p2, q2

the even -matrix component of a(p, q) is therefore

even

a(p, q) =

(a.13)

it now remains to nd odd

a(p, q) and h even((p, q)). subtracting eqn.(a.8)

from eqn.(4.21) we get

(  p    q)bdf (p2, q2, p  q) = iodd

a(p, q)  ih even((p, q))  p. (a.14)

the result of substituting eqs.(a.12, a.13) into eqn.(4.3) and operating with

0 = odd

adding eqn.(a.15) to i{eqn.(a.14)} produces

= 2h even((p, q))  p

h even((p, q)) is of the general form,

h even((p, q)) = h scalar((p2, q2

(a.15)

(a.16)

(a.17)

the symmetry properties of the scalar functions in eqn.(a.17) follow from the
invariance of h((p, q)) under . remembering that bdf (p2, q2, p q) is scalar,
and substituting eqn.(a.17) into eqn.(a.16), we nd that

h 5([p2, q2

] , p  q) = 0 = h 5((p2, q2

h ([p2, q2

finally, substituting eqs.(a.17) to (a.20) into eqn.(a.15),

we now have the vertices f (p, q), given by eqn.(5.6), and a(p, q),
found by summing eqs.(a.12) and (a.21) and given by eqn.(5.5). 
a(p, q)
is now determined by any one of the eqs.(4.7) to (4.10), the scalar d-vertices
are given by the eqs.(4.18) through to (4.25), and the vertex  d(p, q) is
given by any one of the eqs.(4.14) through to (4.17). it is simple to verify that
the solution presented in section 5 is not further constrained by the swis not
used in this derivation.
