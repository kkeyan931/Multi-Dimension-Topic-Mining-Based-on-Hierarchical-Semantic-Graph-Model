abstract

the one-instanton contribution to the prepotential for n = 2 supersymmetric
gauge theories with classical groups exhibits a universality of form. we extrapolate
the observed regularity to su(n ) gauge theory with two antisymmetric hypermul-
tiplets and nf  3 hypermultiplets in the dening representation. using methods
developed for the instanton expansion of non-hyperelliptic curves, we construct an
eective quartic seiberg-witten curve that generates this one-instanton prepotential.
we then interpret this curve in terms of an m-theoretic picture involving ns 5-branes,
d4-branes, d6-branes, and orientifold sixplanes, and show that for consistency, an
innite chain of 5-branes and orientifold sixplanes is required, corresponding to a
curve of innite order.

1. introduction

the program of seiberg and witten [1] allows one to extract the exact low-energy behavior

of four-dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories from the following data: a riemann

surface or algebraic curve specic to the group and representation content of the underlying

lagrangian, and a preferred meromorphic 1-form, the seiberg-witten (sw) dierential. from

this information, one may (in principle) reconstruct the prepotential of the coulomb branch of

the theory in the low-energy limit from the period integrals of the sw dierential. in practice,

technical diculties make the construction of the prepotential a challenging problem.

the riemann surface associated with n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories based on the

classical groups, either without matter hypermultiplets or with hypermultiplets in the dening

representation, is hyperelliptic [2]. in this case systematic methods are available for extracting

the relevant physical information [3][6].

for other n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories, however, the associated riemann surface,

obtained via geometric engineering [7, 8] or m-theory [9][11], is not hyperelliptic, and in fact

one may encounter varieties that are not riemann surfaces at all. for su(n ) gauge theories

with one hypermultiplet in the symmetric (or antisymmetric) representation (with or without

additional hypermultiplets in the dening representation), the riemann surface is described by

a cubic (non-hyperelliptic) curve [11]. for a gauge theory based on a product of m factors of

su(n ) with hypermultiplets in bifundamental representations, the riemann surface is described

by an (m + 1)th order curve [10, 8].

in a series of papers [12][15], we have developed a

systematic approximation scheme to compute the instanton expansion of the prepotential for

non-hyperelliptic curves of cubic and higher order. this allows one to test the predictions of

m-theory and geometric engineering for eld theory, thereby increasing our condence in the

validity of these string-theoretic methods.

in this paper we will discuss the sw problem for su(n ) gauge theory with two matter

1

hypermultiplets in the antisymmetric representation and up to 3 additional hypermultiplets in

the dening representation. since there is no existing m-theoretic or geometric engineering

prediction for the curve for this theory, our methods will dier from previous work on this

subject. we begin by predicting the form of f1inst from the observed regularities of known

prepotentials in section 2.

in section 3, we then reverse engineer a seiberg-witten curve for this theory from the

prepotential, using methods we have developed [12][15] for computing the instanton expansion

for non-hyperelliptic curves. the quartic curve that we derive has the correct limiting behavior

as the mass of either of the antisymmetric hypermultiplets goes to innity.

we then attempt an m-theory interpretation1 of the result in section 4. the quartic curve

corresponds to a picture containing four parallel ns 5-branes, with each adjacent pair linked by

n d4-branes, and four orientifold 6-planes, one on each 5-brane. hypermultiplets in the dening

representation correspond to additional d6-branes. the reection symmetries of the orientifold

6-planes, however, imply an expanded m-theory picture with an innite chain of equally spaced

parallel ns 5-branes, and an innite set of orientifold 6-planes, one lying on each of the ns

5-branes. thus, the eective quartic curve derived in section 3 is only a truncation of a curve

of innite order. to calculate the prepotential to any given order in the instanton expansion,

however, the curve corresponding to only a nite subset of 5-branes is needed. for example, 2d

ns 5-branes (corresponding to a curve of order 2d) are necessary to compute the prepotential

to 1

2 d(d  1)-instanton accuracy.

in section 5 we sum the innite series representing the leading order coecients in the curve

for certain special cases, and are able to represent the curve in terms of theta functions. this

leads us to speculate that our curve is related to a decompactication of the elliptic model

described in m-theory by uranga [16], who considered the scale invariant case of su(n ) with

1we describe the brane structure in terms of type iia string theory, which then lifts to m-theory [10].

two hypermultiplets in the antisymmetric representation and four hypermultiplets in the dening

representation (although he does not specify a curve for this theory). the link to our work would

be if one (or more) of the dening hypermultiplets had their mass(es) sent to innity.

section 6 summarizes our results, and points to issues for further study.

f(a) = fcl(a) + f1loop(a) +



xd=1

[i(g)i(r)]dfdinst(a),

(2.2)

where i(g) [i(r)] is the dynkin index of the adjoint (matter) representation. the prepotential

(2.2) may be obtained from the seiberg-witten data by rst computing the renormalized order

parameters and their duals

2iak = iak

where  is the seiberg-witten dierential and ak and bk are a canonical basis of homology

cycles for the riemann surface, and then integrating

(2.4)

the one-instanton contribution to the prepotential, f1inst, for the classical groups exhibits

a remarkable universality of form when expressed in terms of the renormalized order parameters.

in particular, for su(n ), the one-instanton prepotential has the form [3, 13, 14]

sk (ak),

for (a) nf hypermultiplets in the dening representation, or (b) one hypermultiplet in the

symmetric representation and nf hypermultiplets in the dening representation, while for (c)

one hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric representation and nf hypermultiplets in the dening

representation, it is given by [12, 14]

8i f1inst =

n

xk=1

sk (ak)  2 sm (m).

(2.6)

the expressions sk(ak) and sm(m) in eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) are the coecients of second order

poles at x = ak and x = m, respectively, of a function s(x),

s(x) =

sk(x)
(x  ak)2 =

sm(x)
(x + m)2 ,

(2.7)

which can be obtained from the hyperelliptic approximation to the curve, if it is known. the

explicit form of s(x) for each of the above theories is specied in table 1. (the relative coecient

between the terms in (2.6) guarantees the absence of a pole in f1inst at ak = m.)

one observes from the table the following regularities for s(x), which is a product of factors:

the rst three entries of table 1 almost exhaust the (generic) cases for the coulomb phase of

n = 2 supersymmetric su(n ) gauge theories. the remaining (generic) case of two antisymmet-

ric hypermultiplets (with up to 3 additional hypermultiplets in the dening representation) has

5

not been treated to date. since we know of no m-theoretic or geometric engineering description

of this case, we begin instead by predicting f1inst, and then reverse engineer the sw curve.

based on the regularities described above, we postulate in the last row of table 1 the form of

s(x) for two antisymmetric hypermultiplets with masses 2m1 and 2m2 and 0  nf  3 hyper-

multiplets in the dening representation with masses mj. we then predict the one-instanton

in eq. (2.12), although irrelevant to the computation of the dual order parameters, renders the

prepotential nite in the limit m2  m1.

one can test the postulated form of the prepotential (2.12) by considering the special cases:

(a) n = 2, which is equivalent to su(2) gauge theory with nf  3 dening hypermultiplets.

6

(b) n = 3, which is equivalent to su(3) gauge theory with 2 anti-dening and nf  3 dening

hypermultiplets, or equivalently, su(3) with 2  nf  5 dening hypermultiplets.

(c) the limit m1 or m2  , which removes one of the antisymmetric hypermultiplets from

the theory, in which case eq. (2.12) should reduce to eq. (2.6).

in each of these cases, there is complete agreement (up to an irrelevant constant). therefore,

for the remainder of the paper we take eqs. (2.12) and (2.14) to correctly describe the one-

instanton prepotential for su(n ) gauge theory with two antisymmetric and nf  3 dening

hypermultiplets.

finally, we dierentiate the prepotential to obtain the dual order parameter ad,k for this

theory. using eq. (2.12) together with the one-loop contribution to the prepotential, given by

perturbation theory,

3. the curve

beginning from the one-instanton prepotential (2.12) for su(n ) gauge theory with two

antisymmetric and nf  3 dening hypermultiplets postulated in the last section, we will now

reverse engineer an eective sw curve that can generate this prepotential.

the sw curve associated with su(n ) gauge theory with matter hypermultiplets in the

dening representation is quadratic [1, 2] while for the theory with one hypermultiplet in the

symmetric or antisymmetric representations, the curve is cubic [11]. we expect at least a cubic

curve for two antisymmetric hypermultiplets. the curve for a theory with a product of m factors

of su(n ) with matter in bifundamental representations [10, 8] is of order m + 1, but we found

[15] that to compute the dual order parameters for any of the factor groups to one-instanton

accuracy, it suces to use a quartic approximation to the full curve. (in all cases, the quadratic

approximation is sucient to compute the one-loop prepotential.)

for these reasons, we postulate a quartic curve for the theory with two hypermultiplets in

the antisymmetric representation and nf  3, which takes the general form of the curve of

ref. [10],

l4 j1(x)p2(x) t2 + l p1(x) t + p0(x)

+ lj0(x)p1(x) t1 + l4 j2

0 (x)j1(x)p2(x) t2 = 0,

(3.1)

where l2 = 4nf and the coecient functions pn(x) and jn(x) are to be determined be-

low.2 (the jn(x) are written separately from the pn(x) to represent the contribution of the nf

hypermultiplets in the dening representation.) the coecient functions are chosen to satisfy

pn(x; m1, m2) = pn(x; m2, m1) ,

2alternatively, the factors of j0(x) can be associated with the positive powers of t through the change of

jn(x; m1, m2) = jn(x; m2, m1) ,

(3.2)

variables t  tj0(x), or more controversially, distributed symmetrically between positive and negative powers of

t through t  tj 1/2

multiplets

the rst approximation to eq. (3.5) in an instanton expansion is the hyperelliptic curve

we develop a systematic expansion about the hyperelliptic approximation (3.6), where on one

of the sheets of the riemann surface (3.5),

following the seiberg-witten approach, we will now use the curve (3.5) together with the

sw dierential (3.11)-(3.13) to compute the renormalized order parameters ak and their duals

ad,k using eq. (2.3). our goal will be to choose pn(x) and jn(x) so that ad,k computed from

the curve agrees with eq. (2.17).

the hyperelliptic curve (3.6) has two sheets connected by n branch cuts extending from x
k

to x+

k and centered about x = ek, the zeros of p0(x). we choose the canonical homology basis as

follows: the cycle ak is a simple contour enclosing the branch cut centered about ek; the cycle

bk goes from x

1 to x

k on one sheet and from x

k to x

1 on the other. the order parameter

2iak = hak

 is calculated as in ref. [3]

ak = ek + o(l2).

a check of these coecient functions is obtained if one of the antisymmetric hypermultiplets

is removed from the spectrum by letting its mass go to innity. one may verify that in the limit

m2  , the quartic curve given by (3.5) and (3.23) reduces, after the redenition

the same result holds in the m1   limit, in light of the involution (3.3).

consideration of the one-instanton contribution to the prepotential also allows us to place

(3.26)

the expression (3.26) for q(x) is motivated by the results of sec. 4 of this paper, in which an

innite number of orientifold sixplanes are required in order to satisfy the reection symmetries

of the curve. eq. (3.26) reduces to

q(x)

(x + m1)2 +

b(1)

(x + m1)

(3.27)

in the limit m2  , in agreement with the form of curve for one antisymmetric and nf dening

hypermultiplets [11, 14].

the constants a(1), b(1), . . . in eq. (3.26) are constrained by:

(a) the involution symmetry (3.3),

(b) the absence of log(ak + m1), log(ak + 2m2  m1), etc. terms in ad,k,

(c) the absence of poles in (ak + 3m2  2m1), (ak + 4m2  3m1), etc. in ad,k,

(d) agreement of the coecients of the simple poles at (ak + m1), (ak + 2m2  m1), (ak + m2),

and (ak + 2m1  m2) in ad,k calculated from the curve with those in the expression (2.17), and

(e) the correct limiting behavior of the subleading terms as m1   and m2  .

these constraints give rise to a set of recursion relations that determine all but two of the

constants. we are unaware of any additional eld-theoretic constraints that would allow us to

x the subleading terms of the curve uniquely.

13

we mention that if one arbitrarily truncates the expression q(x) to a nite number of terms,

the constants are uniquely determined by the constraints. the resulting curve, however, has

an unphysical singular limit as m2  m1. we therefore conclude that such a truncation is

inconsistent.

(4.2)

gives rise to the one-instanton prepotential (2.12) postulated in section 2 for su(n ) gauge theory

with two antisymmetric hypermultiplets and nf dening hypermultiplets. in this section, we

14

interpret this curve in terms of m-theory [9]-[11]. we then present evidence that the curve (4.1),

though sucient to generate f1inst, is only an eective curve, and is in fact embedded in an

innite power series in t.

we begin by attempting to associate an m-theory picture3 with the quartic curve (4.1). such

a picture involves four parallel ns 5-branes, with each adjacent pair connected by n parallel

d4-branes (see gure 1). the factors qn

i=1(x + ai + 2m2), qn

i=1(x  ai), and qn

i=1(x + ai + 2m1),

in p1, p0, and p1, respectively, determine the positions of the connecting d4-branes. there are

also d6-branes between the ns 5-branes, which correspond to the factors of jn(x) in eq. (4.1)

representing the hypermultiplets in the dening representation [10].

as noted in the previous section, the quartic curve (4.1) reduces in the limit m2   to

a cubic curve describing su(n ) gauge theory with one antisymmetric hypermultiplet of mass

2m1. in the m-theory picture (g. 1), in this limit the d4-branes dependent on m2 slide o

to innity, and the ns 5-brane denoted by (cid:13)1 becomes disconnected, leaving three parallel ns

5-branes connected by n parallel d4-branes. (in the limit m1  , the ns 5-brane (cid:13)4 becomes

disconnected instead.)

recall that the m-theory picture for a single antisymmetric hypermultiplet involves a nega-

tive charge orientifold sixplane (o6) on the central of three parallel ns 5-branes [11]. this pair

of o6 planes must also be present before the limits m1   and m2   are taken, and we

indicate their positions in g. 1 by s on (cid:13)2 and (cid:13)3 . the factors (and exponents) of (x + m1)

and (x + m2) in the coecient functions (4.2) are exactly those expected for o6 planes in these

locations. to see this, recall that the presence of an o6 plane at x = m1 implies that the

geometry far from the orientifold is represented by the complex manifold [11]

tt =

l2 j0(x) j1(x)

(x + m1)4

(4.3)

3we describe the brane structure in terms of type iia string theory, which then lifts to m-theory [10].

15

and that the curve should be invariant under the orientifold projection

x  x  2m1

;

t  t.

(4.4)

imposing this invariance on the last four terms of the curve (4.1) (those that remain when m2 

) yields the relations p2(x) = (x+m1)6p1(x2m1) and p1(x) = (x+m1)2p0(x2m1),

in agreement with (4.2). a similar story holds for the factors of (x + m2). the fact that the

full quartic curve (4.1) is not invariant under the projection (4.4) is the rst indication that this

curve is incomplete.

o6 planes represent reection symmetries in the m-theory picture, and the reections of

the two o6 planes on (cid:13)2 and (cid:13)3 generate an innite number of parallel ns 5-branes, with

an o6 plane on each of them. the factors of (x + 2m2  m1) and (x + 2m1  m2) in the

coecient functions (4.2) exactly correspond to o6 planes on (cid:13)1 and (cid:13)4 , and the factors of

i=1(x  ai + 2m2  2m1) and qn
qn

d4-branes connecting (cid:13)1 and (cid:13)4 to the rest of the innite chain of ns 5-branes.

i=1(x  ai + 2m1  2m2) in p2 and p2, respectively, represent

the necessary presence of additional ns 5-branes may equivalently be seen by requiring the

sw curve to possess the involution symmetries implied by the o6 planes at x = m1 and

x = m2. as we saw above, the last four terms of the curve (4.1) are invariant under the

involution

x  x  2m1

;

t 

l2 j0(x) j1(x)

(x + m1)4 t

,

(4.5)

but invariance of the full curve requires the presence of a t3 term. similarly, the rst four terms

of the curve (4.1) are invariant under the involution

x  x  2m2

;

t 

(x + m2)4

l2 t

,

(4.6)

but invariance of the full curve requires the presence of a t3 term. only a curve of innite order

can be simultaneously invariant under both involutions.

16

figure 2 represents an expanded view of the brane conguration, involving six parallel ns

5-branes. the positions of the d4-branes, d6-branes, and o6 planes are completely dictated

by reection symmetries. the sextic curve associated with this truncation of the innite chain

of branes is

is identical to (3.17) up to a predictable reection and shift in the argument of s(x). one may

take this as a general principle, which implies that one may take any pair of adjacent parallel

5-branes to dene a hyperelliptic approximation for the instanton expansion. this observation

leads to results equivalent to the successive imposition of involution symmetries such as (4.5)

and (4.6) for all possible embedded quartic curves.

figure 3 shows that in the m2   limit, the m-theory picture of g. 2 reduces to that of

one antisymmetric representation with an o6 plane on ns 5-brane (cid:13)3 . had we taken m1  

17

instead, the analogue to gure 3 would have involved 5-branes (cid:13)1 , (cid:13)2 , and (cid:13)3 connected by d4

branes with an o6 plane on ns 5-brane (cid:13)2 .

pn+1(x) = (x + m2)4n2pn(x  2m2),

jn1(x) = jn(x  2m1),

jn+1(x) = jn(x  2m2),

(4.11)

which fully determine the coecient functions of the curve (including subleading terms) in terms

of p0(x). note that the coecients determined from the recursion relations (4.11) imply that

the ratio (4.9) is invariant, up to a predictable reection and shift in the argument of s(x).

5. summing the series

in this section we sum the innite series (4.10) for certain special cases, obtaining results

in terms of theta functions. the solution to the recursion relations (4.11) allows one to write

(4.10) explicitly, keeping the leading terms only,

(5.9)

the curve (5.8) may now be recast in terms of theta functions as

(5.11)

since the theta functions (5.11) are only dened for |q(x)| < 1, however, we observe from eq. (5.9)

that the series (5.8) is not well-dened for x  m, nor for large l. this may be an indication

that eq. (5.3) is inconsistent with the o(l2) subleading terms omitted. it is possible that these

subleading terms sum up to allow a continuation to regions where |q(x)| > 1. as we saw in sec. 3,

however, such subleading terms are not uniquely determined by the one-instanton prepotential.

nor do we have a prediction of these subleading terms from m-theory.

uranga [16] considers the scale invariant case of su(n ) with two antisymmetric hypermulti-

plets and four dening hypermultiplets this corresponds to an elliptic model [17] with a brane

conguration of two ns 5-branes, with an o6 orientifold on each and two sets of n d4-branes

connecting the two ns 5-branes pair-wise around a circle s1 in the t-direction (or the x6-direction

in the notation of ref. [10]), together with nf = 4 d6-branes. our results for nf  3 may be

regarded as a decompactication of urangas elliptic model, where t is now the covering space of

20

the s1 of the elliptic model. (for  = 0, this is an untwisted elliptic model.) this interpretation

is supported by the fact that the terms of the series (5.3) sum up to form theta functions.

note also the work of yokono [18], who considered softly broken n = 4 usp(2nc) and

so(nc) gauge theory. he nds a brane picture analogous to ours (see for example his gs. 2 and

3). an innite number of parallel 5-branes and o4-planes result from the decompactication

of an elliptic model.

we return to the curve (5.1), taking nf = 0 for simplicity. it is straightforward to expand

the curve in powers of  = m1  m2, and express the result in terms of theta functions. to rst

order in , keeping only the leading terms of pn(x), we nd

where eqs. (5.6), (5.9), and (5.11) have been used, and t = e2is as before. again this is valid

only for |q(x)| < 1. the derivation of (5.10) or the expected elliptic model from an integrable

model remains a challenging problem for future work.

6. summary

from our previous work, we are able to exhibit sucient universality in the form of f1inst

for su(n ) with matter hypermultiplets to present an extremely plausible form (2.12) for f1inst

for two antisymmetric and 0  nf  3 dening hypermultiplets. using methods developed in

refs. [12][15] for a systematic instanton expansion based on a perturbative expansion begin-

ning with a hyperelliptic approximation to a sw curve, we were able to reverse engineer a

quartic curve which reproduces f1inst. the leading order terms in l are unique, and there

are strong constraints on the subleading terms. when the mass of either of the antisymmetric

hypermultiplets goes to innity, the curve reduces to that for one antisymmetric and nf dening

21

hypermultiplets.

the quartic curve constructed in this way led us to an m-theory picture containing four ns

5-branes, connected by d4-branes. however, since there are also o6 planes on each of the

parallel 5-branes, we were forced to consider an innite chain of 5-branes and o6 planes. a

nite subset of 2d of these 5-branes yields an eective curve of order 2d, which is necessary to

compute the prepotential to 1

2 d(d  1)-instanton accuracy. without requiring consistency with

m-theory, one could have stopped with the quartic curve of sec. 3, if the only input were f1inst.

a computation of f3inst from an underlying lagrangian, which could be compared with the

3-instanton prediction of the sextic curve4 of sec. 4, would therefore provide support for the

m-theory picture we have developed.

it is interesting that the sw curve and m-theory picture for su(n ) gauge theory with

two antisymmetric hypermultiplets diers so radically from that with only one antisymmetric

hypermultiplet. it is not a trivial extension of known results, as we had originally anticipated,

but is in fact much richer. nevertheless, our curve and m-theory picture reduce to that of

ref. [11] in the large m1 or m2 limit.

the summation of the innite series representing the curve allowed us to represent it in

terms of theta functions in sec. 5. this suggests that our curve may be related to the decom-

pactication of a scale-invariant elliptic model. uranga [16] has discussed an m-theory picture

for su(n ) with two antisymmetric and four dening hypermultiplets, a scale-invariant case, but

without specifying a curve. we speculate that, were the curve for this theory known, sending

the mass of one or more of the dening hypermultiplets to innity would be consistent with our

analysis.

softly broken n = 4 so(nc) and usp(2nc) gauge theories have been considered by yokono

[18]. his m-theory picture appears to be compatible with our analysis as well, in the sense that

4this prediction is somewhat ambiguous because the subleading coecients of the curve are not known exactly.

22

there is a decompactication with an innite number of equally spaced parallel 5-branes, and

an innite number of orientifold planes.

finally, we remark that the observed universality of form for f1inst shown in table 1 is

still without a satisfactory derivation from rst principles, particularly when the curve is not

hyperelliptic. it is clear from this table, however, that the renormalized order parameters are

the natural variables for this problem, as emphasized in refs. [3] and [12][15].
