abstract

we give an explicit expression for classical 1/4-bps elds in supersymmetric yang-
mills theory on noncommutative tori. we use it to study quantum 1/4-bps states. in
particular we calculate the degeneracy of 1/4-bps energy levels.

introduction

let  be an antisymmetric bilinear form on a lattice zd. an algebra t of func-
tions on a noncommutative torus can be dened as an algebra with generators
uk labelled by lattice vectors k  zd and satisfying the relations

uk1uk2 = exp(i < k1k2 >)uk1+k2 .

(1)

consider derivations i of t dened by the following relations

juk = 2ikj uk, .

this derivations span an abelian lie algebra which we denote by l. given a
homomorphism of a lie algebra l into l we dene a connection with respect
to l as follows. a connection x on a t module e is a set of linear operators
x : e  e, x  l satisfying the leibnitz rule

x(ae) = axe + (xa)e

for any a  t, e  e. here x stands for the image of x  l in l
under the homomorphism introduced above. we also assume that x and x
depend linearly on x. below we are interested in the case when l is a ten-
dimensional abelian lie algebra endowed with a metric. in addition we x a

1

basis in l consisting of vectors x0, xi, i = 1, . . . , d, xi, i = d + 1, . . . , 9 such
that xi = i, i = 0 and the metric tensor g in this basis satises g00 = 1,
gi0 = gi0 = 0, gij = 0, gij = ij . (note that the index conventions in the
present paper are dierent from the ones used in our preceding paper [7].)

if zd entering the denition of a noncommutative torus (1) is considered as
a lattice d in rd one can associate to a given noncommutative torus t two
commutative tori t d and t d. the torus t d is obtained as a quotient (r)d/d
where d is the dual lattice to d. in a more invariant way it can be described
as a group of automorphisms of t that corresponds to the lie algebra l.
the metric tensor gij determines a metric on t d. the torus t d is dened as
rd/d. it can be considered as a torus dual to t d; it is equipped with a metric
specied by the matrix gij that is inverse to the matrix gij.

it is shown in [3] that toroidal compactication of matrix model ([1], [2])
leads to yang-mills theory on a noncommutative torus. more precisely, the
minkowski action functional of compactied theory takes the form

s =

v
4g2

y m

tr(f +   1)(f  +   1) +

iv
2g2

y m

tr i[i, ] .

here f is the curvature of connection  dened with respect to an abelian
ten-dimensional lie algebra l on a projective module e over t ,  is a
constant antisymmetric tensor whose only non-vanishing components are ij,
i, j = 1, . . . , d,  is a ten dimensional majorana-weyl spinor taking values in
the algebra of endomorphisms endt e. this action functional is invariant
under the following supersymmetry transformations

,i =

i

, = 

fij ij  +   1 .

(2)

it is clear from (2) that constant curvature connections on t can be iden-
tied with 1/2-bps elds (see [3] for details).
in papers [6], [7] we studied
constant curvature connections and quantum states that arise by quantization
of these elds and their uctuations. using the constructions of [6] and [7] one
can obtain not only the energies of the 1/2-bps states but also the energies
of other quantum states, in particular, 1/4-bps states. in the present paper
we give a direct construction of 1/4-bps classical elds and use it to study
quantum 1/4-bps states. we restrict ourselves to the case when the matrix ij
is irrational and, moreover, any linear combination of its entries with integer
coecients is irrational. most of our results do not depend on this restriction.

2

however, it permits us to simplify drastically our considerations. namely, us-
ing the above restriction we will be able to reduce the problems we consider
to the case of a free module (the notion of morita equivalence and the results
of [4], [5], [6] play a crucial role in this reduction).

let us formulate our results rst for the case d = 2. a projective module
e over a two-dimensional noncommutative torus t can be characterized by
means of two integers p and q obeying pq > 0. let us also assume that p and
q are relatively prime. a 1/4-bps state on e is characterized by topological
numbers p, q and integers mi, nj
i, j = 1, 2 that specify the eigenvalues of
operators pi = trfijp j and pi = trp i. (here p i stands for the momentum
canonically conjugated to i in the hamiltonian formalism).

we will obtain the following expression for 1/4-bps energy spectrum

(gy m )2
2v dime

ep,q,mi,nj =

(ni + ikmk)gij(nj + jlml) +

+

2v g2

y m dime

(q + 12dime)2 +

dimeqkigijkj

(3)

where ki = pmi  qijnj. the degeneracy of ep,q,mi,nj is given by the number
c(k) where k = g.c.d.(ki) and c(k) is the coecient at xk in the taylor
expansion of the function

1  xn(cid:19)8
z(x) = 28yn (cid:18)1 + xn

.

(4)

for d = 3 projective modules are labelled by an integer p and an antisym-
metric 3  3 matrix qij with integer entries. these numbers have to satisfy
dime = p + 1

2trq > 0. the 1/4-bps spectrum reads

e =

(5)

where vi = midime  qij(nj + jkmk). the degeneracy of this eigenvalue is
given by c(k) obtained from (4) for k = g.c.d.(pmi  qijnj, mi
2ijkqjk). this
expression agrees with the expression obtained in [13] for the commutative
case. we do not consider the case when (p, qij) are not relatively prime. the
results for this case can be derived from our considerations combined with the

1

3

results of [15], [16]. the eigenvalues (3), (5) coincide with the bps bounds
obtained in [7] from supersymmetry algebra. we work in the hamiltonian
formalism on a three-dimensional noncommutative torus. instead of that we
could consider 1/4-bps states using the euclidean lagrangian formalism on a
four-dimensional noncommutative torus. in this setting the problem is related
to the study of cohomology of the moduli space of noncommutative instantons.
this means that one can obtain information about these cohomology groups
from our calculations.

for d > 3 we are able to analyze the degeneracy of 1/4-bps states only
in modules admitting a constant curvature connection. (for d = 2, 3 every
module has this property.)
it was shown in [6], [8] that such modules can
be characterized by the property that corresponding k-theory class  is a
generalized quadratic exponent. we impose also an additional requirement
that the module cannot be represented as a direct sum of equivalent modules
(i.e.  is not divisible by integer larger than 1 in the k-group). such modules
were called basic modules in [6]. we calculate the spectrum of 1/4-bps states
and the corresponding multiplicities in basic modules. the multiplicity again
is given by a number c(k) where the expression for k in terms of topological
numbers is given in section 3.

2 classical 1/4 bps solutions

we start with a brief discussion of the hamiltonian formalism in the model
at hand.
in [6] we discussed the quantization of yang-mills theory on a
noncommutative torus in the 0 = 0 gauge. those considerations can be
easily generalized to the supersymmetric case. let us briey describe the
quantization procedure. the minkowski action functional is dened on the
conguration space conne  (endte)16 where conne denotes the space
of connections on e,  denotes the parity reversion operator. to describe
the hamiltonian formulation we rst restrict ourselves to the space m =
conne  (endte)9  (endt e)16 where conne stands for the space of
connections satisfying 0 = 0, the second factor corresponds to a cotangent
space to conne. we denote coordinates on that cotangent space by p i. let
n  m be a subspace where the gaussian constraint [i, p i] = 0 is satised.
then the phase space of the theory is the quotient p = n /g where g is the
group of spatial gauge transformations.

the presymplectic form (i.e. a degenerate closed 2-form)  on m is dened

(7)

let  be an antisymmetric d  d matrix. we assume that any linear com-
bination of its entries with integer coecients is irrational. consider the cor-
responding d-dimensional noncommutative torus t. let e be a projective
module over it. in this paper we consider a particular class of modules intro-
duced in [6] which we named basic modules. a module e is called basic if the
algebra endt e is a noncommutative torus t and there is a constant curva-
ture connection i on e that satises the condition [i, ] = i for every
  endte (here i, i = 1, . . . d is a basis of the algebra l of derivations of
t). the condition that e is basic is equivalent to the condition that t is com-
pletely morita equivalent to the torus t = endte so that the module e over
t corresponding to e under this equivalence is a one dimensional free module.
therefore, provided components of  satisfy the irrationality condition above,
 and  are related by an so(d, d|z) transformation

where

 = (m + n)(r + s)1

g =   m n

r s !  so(d, d|z) .

(8)

(9)

as specied in the denition a basic module e is equipped with a con-
stant curvature connection. all modules over noncommutative tori admitting
a constant curvature connection are classied in [8] (see also appendix d
of [6]) in terms of their representatives in the k-group k0(e). an element
(e)  k0(t) that corresponds to a module admitting a constant curvature
connection has the form of a generalized quadratic exponent.

if t is a torus of dimension d = 2 or d = 3, then an element in k0(e)
representing a module e over t is always a generalized quadratic exponent;

5

it has the form

(e) = p +

1
2

iqijj

where (p, qij) are integers. the dimension of such a module is given by the
formula

dime = p +

tr(q) .

1
2

it follows from the results of [4] that under an so(d, d|z) transformation (8),
(9) the numbers (p, qij) transform according to a spinor representation. the
condition that (e) given above corresponds to a basic module is gcd(p, qij) =
1.

let us x a basic module e over a d-dimensional torus t and thus a
generalized quadratic exponent  = (e). denote by zk, k   generators of
the torus t = endte. they satisfy the relations

zkzk = eiki ijk

j zk+k .

(10)

using the supersymmetry algebra of the model at hand (see [7]) one can de-
scribe all classical solutions preserving 1/4 of all supersymmetries which we
call 1/4 bps elds. our discussion of these solutions here essentially parallels
the one in [13] for the commutative case.

the equations dening 1/4 bps elds are of the following form

 = 0 ,
[i, j] = cij  1 ,
p d = pd  1 , pi = ci  1 + v g2
d1

9

[i, p i] +

[xi, p i] = 0

xi=1

xi=d+1

[i, xi] = 0 i, j = 1, . . . , d  1 ,

[xi, xj] = 0

y m r1

d [d, i] , pi = v g2

y m r1

d [d, xi]

(11)

d = qgdd, and cij, ci, pd are constants. more precisely, equations

where r1
(11) dene 1/4-bps elds that are invariant under the supersymmetry trans-
formations (2) with ,  satisfying

(0 + d) = 0 ,

 = 

1
4

(cijij + 20ici + 20dpd) .

(12)

in equations (11), (12) we single out the d-th direction. in general a set of
1/4-bps elds preserved by the same subgroup of supersymmetries determines

6

a primitive lattice vector m  zd. (the equations (11) are obtained if one
changes a basis in the lattice zd so that m is the d-th basis vector.)

the last equation in (11) is the gauss constraint. the gauge equivalence
classes of solutions to (11) dene a subspace in the phase space of the theory
- a moduli space of 1/4 bps elds. the presymplectic form (6) gives rise to a
symplectic form on the moduli space and thus one can perform a quantization
of the resulting theory. as any basic module (any module in the d = 2, 3 case)
can be transformed by means of morita equivalence to a free module we can
restrict ourselves to consideration of a free module where the moduli space of
1/4 bps elds can be most easily studied. thus from now on we assume that
e is a rank 1 free module over the torus t = endte.

it is easy to check that the following formulas dene 1/4 bps elds

ai(k)zkm,

i = 1, . . . , d  1

i = i + xkz

p j = pj  1 + v g2
y m

ikaj(k)zkm)

p i = v g2
y m

ikx i(k)zkm)

r1

d (xkz

where i are derivations of t acting according to the formula

jzk = 2ikjzk .

(13)

(14)

the last formula xes a basis in the lie algebra l, and v , rd refer to the
metric tensor gij in this basis. it is straightforward to check that the set of
elds (13) also satises the gauss constraint. moreover, any solution to (11)
can be brought to the form (13) by means of gauge transformations. let us
sketch a proof of this fact. any connection on e has the form  =  + a,
( = 1, . . . , d) where a are endomorphisms of e, which are just elements
of the torus t acting on e from the right (by a slight abuse of notation we
denote the generators of endomorphisms of e by the same letters as generators
of the torus t). first, because of the atness condition [i, j] = 0, i, j =
1, . . . , d  1 we can bring the connection components i to the form

i = i + xkz

ai(k)zkm .

7

due to the equation pi = v g2
y m
[xi, p i] = 0 now takes the form

r1

d [d, i] the gauss constraint [i, p i] +

ii(ad) + [xi, [x i, ad]] = 0 .

this equation implies that ad is of the form

ad = xkz

ad(k)zkm .

finally, using gauge transformations generated by zkm we can bring ad to the
desired form ad = const  1.

note that the space of elds having the form (13) is still invariant under a
subgroup of gauge transformations that consists of transformations dened by
monomials zk. we denote this group by gmon. the symplectic form (6) being
restricted to the subspace (13) reads

1/4 = v g2

where qs stands for the zero mode component as(0), s = 1, . . . , d. the hamil-

the space of elds of the form (13) can be extended by adding fermionic
degrees of freedom to a minimal supermanifold b1/4 invariant under all su-
persymmetry transformations. this is achieved by adding spinor elds  =

pkz (k)zkm. the corresponding additional term to the hamiltonian (16)

reads

ik(k)td(k) .

(17)

h f erm

to describe 1/4-bps states we should quantize the systems described by
the hamiltonian h1/4 + h f erm
on a symplectic manifold b1/4/gmon. (we can
obtain the symplectic form on this manifold restricting the form (6) or adding

1/4

8

fermionic terms to (15).) the combined system (16), (17) describes a free
motion for the zero modes degrees of freedom qs, (0), and an innite system

of supersymmetric harmonic oscillators with frequences (k) = kkk = qkgddk.

this system is a direct analogue of the chiral sigma model on r6t 2 considered
in [13], [14]. more precisely, we can introduce periodic functions

ai() = xkz

ai(k)eik xi() = xkz

xi(k)eik .

and express the hamiltonian and symplectic form in terms of these functions:

we obtained the hamiltonian and symplectic form of the standard chiral
sigma-model. (we write down only the bosonic part of the model. its super-
symmetrization is straightforward.) however the phase space is not standard.
we should factorize with respect to the action of group gmon. in other words
we identify aj() with aj(+2 dsns)+2inj and xi() with xi(+2 dsns)
for any integer valued vector (ns)  zd that species an element of gmon. for
 = 0 this means that we consider the classical sigma-model on t d1r9d; we
will use this terminology also in the case  6= 0 although one should emphasize
that our sigma-model is not completely standard.

3 quantization

for now let us concentrate on the bosonic part (16) of the model. upon
the hamiltonian quantization of the model (16), (15) we get a hilbert space
spanned by the wave functions

pi;n1(k),...,n8(k) = exp(i

d

xs=1

(a

1(k))n1(k)  . . .  (a

8(k))nd1(k)|0i

(20)

9

where a
i (k) (k is a natural number) are oscillators creation operators, ni(k)
are the corresponding occupation numbers, and |0i stands for the oscillators
ground state.

using (10) and (14) one can calculate the action of the group gmon on the
wave function (20). an element zn  gmon acts on (20) by multiplication by
the exponential factor

exp
2i

d

xs=1

ns(ps + sd xkn

8

xl=1

nl(k)k)
 .

hence, the invariance of state vectors under the gauge transformations gen-
erated by the group gmon leads to the quantization condition of zero modes
ps:

8

ps = ns + sd xkn

xl=1

nl(k)k

(21)

where ns are integers. quantization of the fermionic part (17) is straightfor-
ward. note that the zero modes (0) are not dynamical. they only inuence
the degeneracy of states.

the energy spectrum of the system reads

ens,k =

g2
y m
2v

(ns + sdk)gsr(nr + rdk) +

v
4g2

y m

 + kkk

(22)

where

8

8

k = xkn

xl=1

nl(k)k + xkn

xi=1

vi(k)k .

(23)

in the last formula vi(k) = 0, 1 stand for fermionic occupation numbers. for
xed numbers ns and k the degeneracy of the energy eigenvalue (22) is de-
ned by the number of representations of k in the form (23) (the number of
partitions). more explicitly, the degeneracy of the eigenvalue eni,k is given by
the coecient at the k-th power of x in the partition function

1  xn(cid:19)8
z(x) = 28yn (cid:18)1 + xn

.

(24)

from general arguments (see [10], [7]) we know that the eigenvalues of oper-
ators pi = trp i and pi = trfijp j obey the following quantization conditions

pi = ni + ijmj

pj = 2mj

10

where ni, mj (i, j = 1, . . . d) are integers. these eigenvalues are dened for a
given module e and connection  on it. in transition from e to a module
e over morita equivalent torus t connections and endomorphisms on e are
mapped to connections and endomorphisms on e. thus, the integers ni, mj
dening the eigenvalues of operators pi and pi on e transform to new integers
ni and mj related to e. one can prove (see [10], [6], [7] ) that the set of
numbers (ni, mj) transform according to a vector representation of the group
so(d, d|z). for the case at hand when e is some basic module over t and e
is a free module over t = endt e the eigenvalues ni are given in (21), and
for pj a straightforward calculation yields

(25)
where k is given by (23). the integers (ni, mj) related to the free module e
can be expressed via the integers ni and mj corresponding to e as follows

mj = jdk

pj = 2 mj;

ni = m i
mi = sj

j nj  n ijmj
i mj  rijnj .

(26)

(27)
conversely, the values of ni and mj are related to (ni, mj) by means of the
inverse matrix to (9):

g1 =   st n t

rt m t ! .

in transition from e to e one should also take into account the change of
metric tensors

g = agat , a = r + s ,

transformation of the background eld 

 = aat + rat ,

and change of the coupling constant

gy m = |deta|1/2g2

y m

(see [11], [12], [6], [7] for the details). the energy of bps states can now be
written in terms of the topological numbers specied by the matrix (9) and
quantum numbers ni, mj as follows

e =

(gy m )2

(ni + ikmk)gij(nj + jlml) +

+qvigijvj

11

(28)

ij (sk

where vi = a1
j mk  rjknk), a = r + s and r and s are blocks of the
matrix (9). note that the expression (28) does not refer to a particular choice
of basis in the lattice zd which was used earlier for the sake of convenience. we
skipped many technical details here as the calculation essentially parallels the
one made in [6] for the case d = 2. we also omitted the possible topological
terms in formulas (22), (28). one can easily restore them. for the cases
d = 2, 3 one can rewrite the expression (28) for bps energy spectrum in terms
of the topological numbers (p, qij) (formulas (3) and (5) in the introduction to
this paper). the answer coincides with the one given in [7] and agrees with
[9], [10].

using (24), (25), and (27) one can also express the degeneracy of bps
states in terms of the numbers related to e.
it is easy to see that the ex-
pression g.c.d.(xi) where x = (x1, . . . , xd)  zd is invariant under sl(d, z)
transformations. from (25) we know the answer for the case when the vec-
tor mi is directed along the d-th axis. using an sl(d, z) transformation and
invariance of g.c.d.( mi) we obtain that in the general case the degeneracy of
bps states is specied by the number of partitions of the integer

k = g.c.d.(sj

i mj  rijnj) .

for the cases d = 2 and d = 3 it is easy to nd an explicit formula for a matrix
(9) in terms of the topological numbers (p, qij). for the two-dimensional case
one can take

g =   p  1

qij

q
ij

p  1 !

where 1 is the 2  2 identity matrix, q
ij is an antisymmetric 2  2 matrix with
integer entries and p is an integer such that q12q
12 +pp = 1. therefore, for d =
2 the degeneracy of 1/4 bps states is determined by k = g.c.d.(pmi  qijnj).
for d = 3 one can derive the following expression for mi in terms of the

topological numbers p, qij and integers mi, nj

mi = sj

i mj  rijnj = (pi

j + (1  p)qiqj)mj  qijnj

2jklqkl(g.c.d.(qij))1 and the integers qi satisfy p3

where qj = 1
i=1 qi qi = 1.
for k = g.c.d.( mi) one can write a more compact formula k = g.c.d.(pmi 
qijnj, mi
2ijkqjk). here we used the fact that the numbers (p, qij) are relatively
prime. using the same fact one can verify that

1

k = g.c.d.(pmi  qijnj, mi

1
2

ijkqjk) = g.c.d.(pmi  qijnj, mi

1
2

ijkqjk, mini) .

12

the last expression agrees with the formula given in [13] for degeneracies of
1/4-bps states on a three-dimensional commutative torus.

let us discuss now how one can generalize our considerations to the case of
arbitrary modules admitting a constant curvature connection. in this case one
can reduce the problem to the consideration of bps states in a free module
having rank n > 1. again, we can describe 1/4-bps elds and reduce our
problem to the quantization of an analogue of the orbifold chiral sigma model
on (r6  t 2)n /sn . more precisely, the general formula for 1/4-bps elds in
a free module of rank n > 1 can be written in the same way as in the case
n = 1 (formula (13)). the only dierence is that in the general case ai(k),
xi(k) and the zero modes qs  as(0), ps are n  n matrices satisfying the
conditions

[ai(k), aj(k)] = 0

[ai(k), xi(k)] = 0

[xi(k), xj (k)] = 0

for any n  z and any i, j = 1, . . . , d, i, j = d+1, . . . 9. introducing generating
functions

ai() = xkz

ai(k)eik xi() = xkz

xi(k)eik .

we can express these conditions as commutation relations

[ai(), aj()] = 0 ,

[ai(), xi()] = 0 ,

[xi(), xj()] = 0 .

one can use the remaining gauge invariance to simplify further the study of
bps states. using the commutation relations (30) one can prove that there
exists such a matrix-valued function u() satisfying the conditions that the
matrices u1()ai()u(), u1()xi()u() are diagonal and u(0) = 1.
in
the generic case (more precisely in the case when for every  at least one
of the matrices ai(), xi() has distinct eigenvalues) there exists a unique
continuous function u() obeying these conditions and u(2) is a permutation
matrix. let us stress that diagonalized matrix-valued functions ai(), xi()
are not periodic in general.

the above diagonalization permits us to reduce the study of 1/4-bps states
in an arbitrary free module to the study of an orbifold sigma model with the
target space (r9d  t d1)n /sn . a model of this kind was analyzed in [15],
[16]. it was shown there that when n tends to innity such a model is related

13

to string theory in the light cone gauge. as it was emphasized at the end of
section 2 our sigma-model is not completely standard, however the consider-
ations of the papers we mentioned can be applied to our situation. we can
conclude that in the situation when bps-elds are dominant the sym theory
on noncommutative torus is related to string theory/m-theory. looking more
closely at this relation we nd an agreement with the physical interpretation
of compactications on noncommutative tori in terms of toroidal compactica-
tions of m-theory with non-vanishing expectation value of the three-form (see
[3]).
in particular, the relation between m-theory/string spectra and sym
spectra (for example see [17]) agrees with our formulas.
