abstract

multidimensional model describing the cosmological evolution of n einstein
spaces in the theory with l scalar elds and forms is considered. when electro-
magnetic composite p-brane ansatz is adopted, and certain restrictions on the pa-
rameters of the model are imposed, the dynamics of the model near the singular-
ity is reduced to a billiard on the (n  1)-dimensional lobachevsky space h n 1,
n = n + l. the geometrical criterion for the niteness of the billiard volume and its
compactness is used. this criterion reduces the problem to the problem of illumina-
tion of (n  2)-dimensional sphere sn 2 by point-like sources. some examples with
billiards of nite volume and hence oscillating behaviour near the singularity are
considered. among them examples with square and triangle 2-dimensional billiards
(e.g.
that of the bianchi-ix model) and a 4-dimensional billiard in truncated
d = 11 supergravity model (without the chern-simons term) are considered. it
is shown that the inclusion of the chern-simons term destroys the conning of a
billiard.

1 introduction

at present there exists a special interest to the so-called m- and f-theories [1, 2, 3, 4].
these theories are supermembrane analogues of superstring models [5] in d = 11, 12
etc. the low-energy limit of these theories leads to models governed by the action

the signature of the metric is (1, +1, . . . , +1).

with mi being einstein space (i = 1, . . . , n) and when the composite p-brane ansatz is
considered (for review see, for example, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]) the problem is reduced to
the gravitating self-interacting -model with certain constraints imposed. for electric
p-branes see also [12, 13, 14] (in [14] the composite electric case was considered).

in cosmological (or spherically symmetric) case m = ir and the problem is eectively

reduced to a toda-like system with the lagrangian [16]

and the zero-energy constraint e = 0 imposed, where ( gab) is a non-degenerate symmet-
ric n  n matrix (n = n + l), as 6= 0, x = (xa)  irn , u s = (u s
a)  irn , s  s. the
considered cosmological model contains some stringy cosmological models (see for exam-
ple [17]). it may be obtained (at a classical level) from a multidimensional cosmological
model with a perfect uid [18, 19] as a special case.

the integrability of the lagrange equations corresponding to (1.5) crucially depends

upon the scalar products (u s1, u s2), s1, s2  s, where
(u, u ) = gabuau 
b,

u, u   irn , where ( gab) = ( gab)1.

in the orthogonal case

) = 0

s, s  s, a class of cosmological and spherically-symmetric solutions was obtained in
[16]. special cases were also considered in [20, 21, 23, 22]. recently the orthogonal
solutions were generalized to so-called block orthogonal case [24, 25].

this paper is devoted to the investigation of the possible oscillating (and probably
stochastic) behaviour near the singularity (see [27]-[45] and references therein) for cosmo-
logical models with p-branes.

we remind that near the singularity one can have an oscillating behavior like in the
well-known mixmaster (bianchi-ix) model [27]-[30] (see also [39]-[42]). multidimensional
generalizations and analogues of this model were considered by many authors (see, for
example, [31]-[38]). in [43, 44, 45] a billiard representation for a multidimensional cos-
mological models near the singularity was considered and a criterion for a volume of the
billiard to be nite was established in terms of illumination of the unit sphere by point-
like sources. for perfect-uid this was considered in detail in [45]. some topics related to
general (non-homogeneous) situation were considered in [46].

here we apply the billiard approach suggested in [43, 44, 45] to a p-brane cosmology.
the cosmological model with p-branes may be considered as a special case of a cosmo-
logical model for multicomponent perfect uid with the equations of state for brane
components: ps
i = s, when brane s lives or does not live in the space
i = s or ps
mi respectively, i = 1, . . . , n.

the paper is organized as follows. in sec. 2 the cosmological model with p-branes is
considered. sec. 3 deals with the lagrange representation to equations of motion and
the diagonalization of the lagrangian. in sec. 4 a billiard approach in the multidimen-
sional cosmology with p-branes is developed. a necessary condition for the existence of
oscillating (e.g. stochastic behaviour) near the singularity is established:

where m is the number of p-branes. in sections 5 and 6 some examples of billiards (e.g.
in truncated d = 11 supergravity etc.) are considered.

einstein spaces. the functions , i: (t, t+)  ir are smooth.

3 lagrange representation

here, like in [16], we impose a restriction on p-brane congurations, or, equivalently,
on a,v. we assume that the energy momentum tensor (tm n ) has a block-diagonal
structure (as it takes place for (gm n )). sucient restrictions on a,v that guarantee a
block-diagonality of (tm n ) are the following ones:

1. for any a   and v = e, m there are no i, j  a,v such that

i = {i}  (i  j), j = {j}  (i  j),

di = dj = 1, i 6= j;

2. for any a   there are no i  a,m and j  a,e such that

i, j = 1, . . . , n.

in (3.2)

i = {j}  j,

dj = 1,

i  i0 \ i

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

is a dual set (i0 is dened in (2.13)). the restrictions (3.1) and (3.2) are trivially
satised when n1  1 and n1 = 0 respectively, where n1 is the number of 1-dimensional
manifolds among mi.
it follows from [6] (see proposition 2 in [6]) that the equations of motion (2.1)(2.3)

and the bianchi identities

df s = 0,

s  s,

(3.4)

for the eld conguration (2.8), (2.18)(2.20), (2.22), (2.24) with the restrictions (3.1),
(3.2) imposed are equivalent to equations of motion for lagrange system with the la-
grangian

3.1 diagonalization of the lagrangian
the minisuperspace metric (3.14) has a pseudo-euclidean signature (, +, . . . , +), since
the matrix (gij) has the pseudo-euclidean signature, and (h) has the euclidean one.
hence there exists a linear transformation

diagonalizing the minisuperspace metric (3.14)

where ea = (ea

inverting the map (3.36) we get

for dj > 1, j = 1, . . . , n. for dj = 1 we have j = aj = 0.

4 billiard representation

here we put the following restrictions on parameters of the model:

s = +1,
(ii) d(is) < d  2,

(3.52)

(3.53)

(4.1)
(4.2)

s  s. for a = 1, a  , and [g] = 1, the rst restriction means that all (is) = 1,
s  s, i.e. all p-branes are either euclidean or contain even number of times. restriction
(ii) implies

(4.3)

(u s, u s) = d(is) 1 +

d(is)

2  d! + 2

as > 0,

where 2 = h, d > 2. as we shall see below, both restrictions are necessary for a
formation of potential walls in the lobachevsky space when a certain asymptotic in time
variable is considered.

here we consider a behaviour of the dynamical system, described by the lagrangian

(3.45) with the potential (3.46) for n  3 in the limit

(4.4)
where v  {(z0, ~z)  irn|z0 < |~z|} is the lower light cone. for the volume scale factor

v = exp(

xi=1

(q > 0) we have in this limit v  +0. under certain additional assumptions the limit
(4.4) describes an approaching to the singularity.
due to relations (3.48), (3.51)-(3.53), (4.1) and (4.3) the parameters u r in the potential

(3.46) obey the following restrictions:

1. ar > 0 for (u r)2 = (u r
2. u r

0 > 0 for all r  s.

0 )2 + (~u r)2 > 0;

(4.6)
(4.7)

11

now we restrict the lagrange system (3.45) on v, i.e. we consider the lagrangian
(4.8)

l  l|t m,

m = v  ir+,

where t m is a tangent vector bundle over m and ir+  {n > 0}. (here f|a means a
restriction of function f on a.) introducing an analogue of the misner-chitre coordinates
in v [36,37] which reduce the problem to a unit disk

ar exp[ (y, 2u r)],

where

(y, u)  ey0

then, it is not dicult to verify that the lagrange equations for the lagrangian (4.11)

(4.20)
now we are interested in a behavior of the dynamical system in the limit y0  
(or, equivalently, in the limit z2 = (z0)2 + (~z)2  , z0 < 0) implying (4.4). using
the relations (u0 6= 0 )

(y, u) = 2y0 + (y, u).

for u 2 > 0, u0 > 0. in (4.24) we denote

(x)  + , x  0,

using relations (4.6), (4.7) and relations (4.19), (4.23), (4.24) we obtain

we put  > 0, then the limit t   describes an approach to the singularity.
when s 6=  the lagrangian (4.35) describes a motion of a particle of unit mass,
moving in the (n  1)-dimensional billiard b  dn 1 (see (4.28)). the geodesic motion
in b corresponds to a kasner epoch and the reection from the boundary corresponds
to the change of kasner epochs [45].

let the billiard b has an innite volume: volb = + and there are open zones at the
innite sphere |~y| = 1. after a nite number of reections from the boundary a particle
in this case for a corresponding cosmological
moves towards one of these open zones.
model we get the kasner-like behavior in the limit t   and the absence of a
stochastic behaviour.
let volb < +. there are two possibilities in this case: i) the closure of the billiard
b is compact (in the topology of dn 1) ; ii) b is non-compact. in these two cases the
motion of a particle is oscillating.

in [45] we proposed the simple geometric criterion for niteness of volume of b and
compactness of b in terms of the positions of the points (4.30) with respect to the (n2)-
dimensional unit sphere sn 2 (n  3).
denitions. a point ~n  sk (k  1) is illuminated by a point-like source located at
a point ~v  irk+1, |~v| > 1, if and only if |~n  ~v|  q|~v|2  1. a point ~n  sk is strongly
illuminated by a point-like source located at the point ~v  irk+1, |~v| > 1, if and only if
|~n  ~v| < q|~v|2  1. the subset p  sk is called (strongly) illuminated by a point-like
sources at {~v,   a} if and only if any point from p is (strongly) illuminated by some
source at ~v,   a.
proposition [45]. the billiard b (4.28) has a nite volume if and only if point-
like sources of light located at the points ~v (4.30) illuminate the unit sphere sn 2. the
closure of a billiard b is compact (in the topology of dn 1  h n 1) if and only if sources
at points (4.30) strongly illuminate sn 2.
we remind, that the problem of illumination of a convex body in a multidimensional
vector space by point-like sources for the rst time was considered in [47, 48]. for the

14

case of sn 2 this problem is equivalent to the problem of covering spheres with spheres
[49, 50].

there exists a topological bound on a number of point-like sources m illuminating the

sphere sn 2 [48]:

m  n.

(4.37)

thus, we obtain the restriction (1.8). according to this restriction the number of p-branes
m = |s| should at least exceed the critical value n = n + l for the existence of oscillating
(e.g. stochastic) behaviour near the singularity.

we remind that kasner-like solutions have the following form

relations (4.42) may be easily understood using relations (3.32). indeed, from (3.32)
and zero value limits for forms f a, a  , we get

exp[2u s(x)] = cs 2u s()  0, cs 6= 0,

(4.43)

for   +0. these relations imply (4.42).
now we give a rigorous explanation of (4.42). let us denote by k a set of kasner
vector parameters  = (a)  irn satisfying (4.40). k is an ellipsoid isomorphic to sn 2.
the isomorphism is dened by the relations

proposition 1. let us consider a point-like source located at a point ~vs from (4.30).
a point ~n  sn 2 is illuminated by this source if and only if the corresponding kasner

if and only the relation (4.42) is satised.

corollary. a point ~n  sn 2 is not illuminated by a source at a point ~vs from (4.30)
a small modication of the proposition 1 is the following one.
proposition 1a. a point ~n  sn 2 is strongly illuminated by a source at ~vs if and
due to proposition 1 the criterion of the niteness of a billiard volume (see proposition)

only if u s() < 0.

may be reformulated in terms of inequalities on kasner-like parameters [45].

proposition 2. billiard b (4.28) has a nite volume if and only if there are no 

satisfying the relations (4.40) and (4.42).

the positions of sources are dened (up to o(n  1)-rotation) by scalar products

thus, we obtained a billiard representation for the model under consideration when

the restrictions (4.1) and (4.2) are imposed.

now we relax the rst restriction, i.e. we put

for some s  s. relation (4.49) occurs when spherically symmetric solutions with p-

branes are considered [16, 25].
v =  instead of v = + inside of walls. the waterfall potentials prevent the
oscillating behaviour near the singularity but meanwhile do not forbid the existence of
solutions with kasner-like asymptotical behaviour (if there are open shadow zones). let
us consider the following example:

d1 = 1,

(4.50)

for all s  s, i.e. all branes overlap the one-dimensional space m1. in this case the
kasner set

family of solutions with asymptotical kasner-like behaviour with parameters  = (a)
belonging to an open neighbourhood of the (milne) point from (4.51).

5 examples of two-dimensional billiards

in this section we give several examples of two-dimensional billiards with nite areas that
occur in the models under consideration.

5.1 billiard is a square

m = ir  m1  m2

where d1 = dim m1 = d, d2 = dim m2 = d, d = 1 + 2d, n1 = d + 1, n2 = d, d  2, w = 1
and (1) = (2) = 1. let

s1 = (1, e,{1}),

s2 = (1, e,{2}),

s3 = (2, m,{1}),

s4 = (2, m,{2}),

(5.3)

i.e. we have two electric branes corresponding to the form f 1, and two magnetic branes
corresponding to f 2. branes s1 and s3 live in m1 and branes s2 and s4 live in m2.

we put

then from (4.48) we get

1 = 2 = ,

2 = d/2.

(~vsi)2 = ~vs1~vs4 = ~vs2~vs3 = 2(2d  1),

(5.4)

(5.5)

i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and

~vs1~vs2 = ~vs1~vs3 = ~vs2~vs4 = ~vs3~vs4 = 0.

(5.6)
this means that the points ~vsi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, form a square in ir2 containing s1
(~vs1 = ~vs4, ~vs2 = ~vs3), i.e. all points of s1 are illuminated by these four points. the
billiard b (4.28) is a sub-compact square ( b is compact) in the lobachevsky space. for
d = 2 (d = 5) it is depicted on fig. 1.

let
(5.9)

i.e. we have three electric branes corresponding to the form f 1. the brane si lives in
mi, i = 1, 2, 3.

~vsi~vsj = 1  3d,

(5.10)
(5.11)

i 6= j; i, j = 1, 2, 3.
for d  2 the points ~vsi, i = 1, 2, 3, form a triangle in ir2 containing s1 and all points
of s1 are illuminated by these three points. the billiard (4.28) is a sub-compact triangle
in the lobachevsky space d2. for d = 2 it is depicted on fig. 2.

for d = 1 we obtain (at least formally) the billiard b depicted on fig. 3. the closure
of b is not compact but the area of b is nite. this billiard appears in the well-known
bianchi-ix model (for a review, see [39, 40, 45]). for d = 1 the restriction on composite
p-branes (3.1) is not satised but to avoid this obstacle we may consider non-composite
case when the lagrangian (5.8) is replaced by the following lagrangian in the dimension

and the relation (5.9) is replaced by its non-composite analogue:

magnetic 5-branes (d(is) = 6).

scalar products (6.2)-(6.6) are (in some sense) building blocks for constructing billiards
for the model under consideration.

now we suggest an example of a billiard with a nite volume that occurs in the
truncated d = 11 supergravity. let us consider the metric (2.8) dened on the manifold

m = ir  m1  . . .  m5,

(6.7)

where all (mi, gi), i = 1, . . . , 5, are 2-dimensional einstein manifolds of the euclidean
signature and w = 1.
mj  mk, 1  i < j < k  5. thus, the 5-branes are labeled by indices

s = s(i, j, k) = (1, m,{i, j, k}),

(6.8)

20

1  i < j < k  5.
it follows from (6.3) and (6.5) that all vectors ~vs have the same length: |~vs| = 6 and
~vs~vs = 1,4 for dimensions of intersections d(is  is) = 4, 2 respectively.
now we prove that in our case the set of sources located at points ~vs  ir4, s 
s = sm illuminates the 3-dimensional (kasner) sphere s3 and hence (according to the
proposition from section 4) the 4-dimensional billiard (4.28) b  d4 has a nite volume.
due to proposition 2 from section 4 it is sucient to prove the following proposition.

proposition 3. there are no  = (1, . . . , 5)  ir5 satisfying the relations

g = {  k|1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5}

and

g = {  k|1  2  3  4  5}.

(6.14)
g is an open submanifold of the 3-dimensional kasner manifold k and g is a closure
of g. g is compact subset of k. let us consider a smooth function f : ir5  ir dened
by the relation
(6.15)
let f| = f| g be a restriction of f on g. f| is a continuous function reaching an (absolute)
maximum on the compact (topological) space g:

f () = 1 + 2 + 3.

(6.16)
max  g. it is clear that c  0, since c  f (1) = 0, where 1 is dened in (6.12). to
prove the proposition it is sucient to prove that the point of maximum max is unique
and

c = maxf| = f (max),

max = 1.

(6.17)

21

let us prove the relation (6.17). the point max does not belong to g. indeed, if we
suppose that max  g we get the conditional extremum relation

at  = max, where

the point of maximum max does not belong to any face a, a = 1, 2, 3, 4. indeed, if
we suppose that max belongs to some face a we get the conditional extremum relation
(6.18) with modied :

a = 1, 2, 3, 4. but one may verify that there are no solutions of the relation (6.18) in
this case. analogous arguments lead us to a non-existence of points of maximum among

(6.36)

the points of edges e12, e13, e14, e23, e24, e34. here the only dierence is that there exist

we also proved the proposition 3 (as a consequence of the proposition 4) and due to

proposition 2 the following proposition.

proposition 5. for the model (6.1)-(6.8) the kasner sphere s3 is illuminated by the
set of ten sources located at points ~vs  ir4 from (4.30) , with s = s(i, j, k), 1  i < j <
k  5, dened in (6.8), and hence the billiard b (4.28) has a nite volume.

moreover, this proposition may be strengthen as follows.

respectively (see (4.44)) are strongly illuminated by the set of ten sources ~vs  ir4, s  s.
proof. the set k of kasner parameters satisfying (6.9) is a union of 5! = 120 sectors

k = k12345  k21345  . . .  k54321,

where

ki1i2i3i4i5 = g = {  k|i1  i2  i3  i4  i5}

(6.44)

(6.45)

and (i1, i2, i3, i4, i5) is a permutation of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). due to proposition 1a and propo-
sition 4 any point ~n = ~n()  s3 corresponding to   k12345 \ {1} is strongly illu-
minated by the source located at point ~vs, with s = s(1, 2, 3). analogously, any point
~n = ~n()  s3 corresponding to   ki1i2i3i4i5 \ {i1} is strongly illuminated by the
source located at point ~vs, with s = s(i1, i2, i3), where (i1, i2, i3, i4, i5) is a permutation of
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5). the proposition is proved.

23

the points ~n1, . . . , ~n5 from proposition 5a are not strongly illuminated (see proposition
1a). thus, proposition 5, proposition 5a and proposition (from section 4) imply that the
billiard b (4.28) has a nite volume but its closure b is not compact. points ~n1, . . . , ~n5 
s3 are ending points of ve horns of b. (these horns look similar to potential energy
valleys that occur in some toy models, e.g. related to m(atrix) theory [51]).

using relations (4.44) one may verify that

~ni~nj =

,

i 6= j,

(6.46)

i, j = 1, . . . , 5. this means that ~n1, . . . , ~n5 are vertices of a 4-dimensional simplex.

here we considered the billiard b generated by ten sources, corresponding to non-zero
charges : qs 6= 0, s  s. if some charges are zero: qs = 0, s  s0, then the corresponding
points ~vs, s  s0 (s0 6= ) are switched o and billiard is generated by m  9 point-like
sources. in this case we have the following proposition.
proposition 5b. in terms of proposition 5 any subset of sources ~vs, s  s \ s0, with
s0 6= , does not illuminate the kasner sphere s3 and hence the billiard b generated by
this subset has an innite volume.
proof. without a loss of generality let us suppose that s0 contains s(1, 2, 3), i.e. at
least the source at ~vs, s = s(1, 2, 3), is switched o. then, the point ~n corresponding
to the set  = (i) from (6.41) belongs to the shadow, since

i + j + k > 0,

(6.47)

for all 1  i < j < k  5, (i, j, k) 6= (1, 2, 3). thus, the shadow set is non-empty. (this
set is open since it is an intersection of a nite number of open shadow sets corresponding
to sources of light.) the proposition is proved.

6.2

inclusion of chern-simons term

now we consider the total bosonic sector action for d = 11 supergravity with the chern-
simons term included:

s = str + czm

a  f  f

(6.48)

where str is dened in (6.1), c = const, (f = da). since the second term in (6.48) (chern-
simons term) does not depend upon a metric the einstein equations are not changed. the
only modication of equations of motion is related to maxwell equations

d  f = const f  f.

(6.49)

due to (6.49) solutions to eld equations corresponding to the truncated model (6.1) with
the trivial chern-simons term

are also solutions for d = 11 supergravity.

now, we are interested in existence of solutions for the truncated model with non-zero

f  f = 0.

(6.50)

charges qs 6= 0 satisfying (6.50).

calculating the hodge dual in (2.20) and using the solution (3.32) we get

f = ef xss

qs ( is),

f = 2

5

xi=1

xi  ,

where is = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\ is, s  s = sm, and s is the index set dened in (6.8). for the
chern-simons term we obtain

(6.51)

(6.52)

(6.53)

(6.54)

where

e2f f  f = 2

xi=1

pi ( {i}),

i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. here (a, b) = 1 for a = b, (a, b) = 0 otherwise.

2pi = xs,ss

qsqs(is  is,{i}),

proposition 6. let all charges be non-zero: qs 6= 0 for all s  s. then

(f  f )(z) 6= 0,

proof. let us suppose that the chern-simons term vanishes in some point (i.e.

in all points z  m.
relation (6.50) in some point is satised). since forms  ( {i}) are linearly independent at
any point, we obtain pi = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or explicitly

(6.55)
(6.56)
(6.57)
(6.58)
(6.59)
where we denote qijk = qs for s = s(i, j, k), 1  i < j < k  5. let us denote k2 = q345,
k3 = q245, k4 = q235, k5 = q234 and a = q145, b = q135. from (6.59) we get

p1 = q123q145 + q124q135 + q125q134 = 0,
p2 = q123q245 + q124q235 + q125q234 = 0,
p3 = q123q345 + q134q235 + q135q234 = 0,
p4 = q124q345 + q134q245 + q145q234 = 0,
p5 = q125q345 + q135q245 + q145q235 = 0,

b 
from the relation k3p3 + k4p4 + k5p5 = 0 we get

q125 = 

k3
k2

k4
k2

a.

from (6.57)and (6.58) we deduce

q134 = 

k5
k4

b 

k5
k3

a.

q123 =

k4k5
k2k3

a, q124 =

k3k5
k2k4

b.

(6.60)

(6.61)

(6.62)

substituting (6.60)-(6.62) into eq. (6.55) we get

(k4a)2 + (k3b)2 + (k4a + k3b)2 = 0.

(6.63)
hence a = b = 0. but this contradicts our supposition, that qs 6= 0. so, the proposition
is proved.
thus, it follows from proposition 5b and proposition 6, that the inclusion of the
chern-simons term leads us to the billiard b of innite volume. in this case some kasner
(shadow) zones are opened and we have the kasner-like behaviour near the singularity.

7 discussions

in this paper we considered the behaviour near the singularity of the multidimensional
model describing the cosmological evolution of several einstein spaces in the theory with
scalar elds and elds of forms. using the results from [43, 44, 45] we obtained the billiard
representation on multidimensional lobachevsky space for the cosmological model near
the singularity. we suggested and studied examples with oscillating behaviour near the
singularity in the model with four p-branes and a square billiard and in the model with
three p-branes, when the billiard is a triangle (like it takes place in bianchi-ix model). a
4-dimensional billiard with a nite volume in the truncated d = 11 supergravity was
also considered. it was shown that the inclusion of the chern-simons term leads to the
destruction of some conning walls of the billiard.
