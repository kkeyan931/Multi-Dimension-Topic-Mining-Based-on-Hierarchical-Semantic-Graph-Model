(if addition holomorphic connection satises equation (2), corresponding holomorphic bundle mumford-takemoto semistable.) thus, within context restriction complex subvarieties holomorphic bun- dles,

fourier-mukai transforms, nally conclude discussion precisely one needs grothendieck groups derived categories discuss fourier-mukai transforms general d-brane congurations. 4.1 physical motivation begin discussing fourier-mukai transforms technical detail, shall discuss pair examples precisely sometimes claimed {$9702173$} z2 subgroup 9 t-duality group acting branes wrapped complex algebraic tori realized fourier- mukai transform. note d-branes wrapped 2g, speak t-duality mean, t-duality along 2g s1s 2g. since t-dualized even number times, always take type iia back type iia, type iib back type iib. 1) consider rank n bundle 2, c1 = 0 words, su(n) bundle 2. precisely corresponds n dp-branes wrapped 2, immersed d(p2)-brane charge. one expects t-duality map conguration n d(p2)-branes, support points 2. indeed, precisely nd. reasonably nice7 su(n) bundles e 2, fourier-mukai transform skyscraper sheaf 2, supported points. 2) consider rank n bundle e 4 words, u(n) bundle 4. precisely corresponds n dp-branes wrapped 4, immersed d(p 2)-brane charge c1(e), d(p4)-brane charge given ch2(e) = c2(e)(1/2)c1(e)2. t-duality expect d(p 4)-brane charge8 4 become dp-branes wrapped 4, dp-branes wrapping 4 become d(p 4)-brane charge 4. thus, expect t-dual conguration another bundle e dual 4, rank ch2(e), ch2( e) = rank e. indeed, precisely nd. reasonably nice9 bundles e 4, dual bundle e of10

points x x, px simple, px = px x (where x dualizing sheaf x), two distinct points x1, x2 x integer i, one exti x (px1 , px2) = 0 {$9702173$}. 11 thus map individual coherent sheaves class objects

transformation minor sign asymmetries relative original transformation , inverses fourier transformations often dened relative signs. contrast, presented fourier-mukai transformations implicitly symmetric fashion, means results interpreted physically z2 ambiguity. order describe sign problem precisely, let us reconsider two examples given beginning section, somewhat careful signs. 1) consider holomorphic rank n bundle e 2, c1 = 0 words, su(n) bundle 2. mentioned earlier, assume e w.i.t.1, r02(p 1e) = 0 close examination denition fourier-mukai transform reveals that, ele- 0( 2), fourier-mukai transform e precisely torsion sheaf e = ment k r12 (p 1e) rather virtual torsion sheaf e k 0( 2). 2) consider holomorphic rank n bundle e 4 words, u(n) bundle 4. assume complex structure

fourier-mukai transform e precisely bundle e = element k 1e) rather virtual bundle e k r12(p 0( 4). presented far, sign problem could naively cured redening fourier-mukai transform. unfortunately, diculty much deeper. consider applying studying branes wrapped 2g, fourier-mukai transform twice. means t-dualizing along 2g s1s 2g twice, intuitively return started. according {$9810188$}, 2 = (1) action db(t 2g).  formally shifts complexes g places right, (1) multiplies complex coordinates torus 1. descends action grothendieck group that, g odd, switches signs (naively exchanging branes antibranes), g even, leaves grothendieck group essentially invariant. thus, apply fourier-mukai transform twice, get precisely element grothendieck group started with, rather element diering 13 sign. thus, clearly identify fourier-mukai transforms t-duality z2. mentioned earlier, fundamental diculty, merely reects fact dened fourier-mukai transform symmetrically respect torus dual, rather sign asymmetries often introduced. 4.5 non-w.i.t. sheaves earlier gave denition w.i.t. sheaves, noted w.i.t. sheaves, fourier- mukai transforms simplify greatly action becomes well dened individual w.i.t. sheaves, one need full technology derived categories and/or grothendieck groups. prior physics literature fourier-mukai transforms, sheaves typically assumed w.i.t., precisely reason. unfortunately, coherent sheaves one would like study w.i.t. even supersymmetric d-brane vacua w.i.t. general case one needs sophisticated methods reviewed paper. section shall work example non-w.i.t. sheaf, speak relationship w.i.t. condition mumford-takemoto semistability. first, let us construct easy explicit example non-w.i.t. sheaf. consider sheaf e 2, e w.i.t. rank n bundle c1 = 0, torsion sheaf supported

mumford-takemoto stable , consequently serre duality n-(complex-)dimensional torus, h n(e l) = 0 line bundle l arguments above, rn2 (p 1e) = 0. thus, torsion-free, mumford-takemoto stable sheaf 4 c1 =

w.i.t. far discussion relationship w.i.t. condition mumford- takemoto stability, spoken stable sheaves. would one deal mumford-takemoto semistable sheaves stable? all, also satisfy conditions supersymmetric d-brane vacuum. noted {$9810064$}, using properly semistable sheaf, physics sees split sheaf stable factors. thus, questions regarding fourier-mukai transforms w.i.t. conditions

necessarily non-supersymmetric conguration branes antibranes, see even without tachyon condensation, sometimes brane/antibrane conguration equivalent conguration branes15. thus, even without tachyon
