abstract

two dierent approaches - kallens and brandts methods - for calcu-
lation of the schwinger terms in the 1+1 dimensional abelian and non-
abelian free current algebras are discussed. these methods are applied
to calculation of the single and double commutators. the validity of the
jacobi identities is examined in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions and in this way
is given natural restriction on the regularization.
it is shown that the
jacobi identity cannot be broken in 1+1 dimensions even using the regu-
larization which fails in the 3+1 dimensional case. a connection between
the schwinger term and anomaly is shown in the simplest case of the
schwinger model.

introduction

schwinger terms [1, 2, 3], i.e. terms proportional to the derivatives of the -
function in commutators of currents or gauge generators, play an important role
in the investigations of various eld theory models [4]-[28].

they are closely related to quantum anomalies and therefore to the com-
pleteness and the self-consistency of a given quantum eld theory (qft). this
is the main reason they should be considered.

in particular, it is well known that the seagull terms which are introduced
to covariantize the time ordered product of current operators do not cancel the
schwinger terms in the equal time commutator (etc) and feynmans conjecture
fails [36].

in this paper i will present a resume of the results which can be obtained
using two dierent approaches for the calculations of the schwinger terms in the
1+1 dimensional abelian and non-abelian free current algebras.

roughly speaking, if the algebra of the currents or the gauge generators
[4]-[28] of the quantum theory is not closed we get an indication this theory

1

could be the anomalous and then the whole process of its quantization is highly
non-trivial [29]-[33].

there are several methods for the calculation of the etc. here i use kallens
[34] and brandts [35] methods. from my point of view these two methods are
more elegant and simple, especially in 1+1 dimensions, than e.g.
the bjl-
method [37, 38]. i think the main dierence lies in the logic of the problem.

in kallens or brandts methods we start with the canonical commutation

relations, then we calculate the etc and nally the anomaly (see section 4).

in the case of the commutator of the two currents using bjl-technique we
have to calculate the vacuum expectation value (vev) of their t-product, i.e.
all relevant feynman graphs. only after this we are able to nd the anomaly
and, subsequently, the etc. this is obviously a rather indirect procedure.

of course i am aware of the problems of brandts and kallens method in
3+1 dimensions. brandts method fails to give reliable results once we get to
the spatial limit (e.g. [35]). problem of kallens method lies in the possibility
of changing the order of the integration (see (2.6)). nevertheless i believe that
it is possible to improve these methods.

another open question, which is closely related to equal-time algebras, is
a violation of the jacobi identity. again, it is possible to use bjl [40]-[46],
kallens or brandts (point-splitting) [39] methods.

the key point of the problem consists in correct denitions of current oper-

ators and their multiplication.

in general, it would be desirable that the jacobi identity is fullled, since
the multiplication of well-dened operators on the hilbert space is necessarily
associative. regularization procedures dening the current commutators and
respecting the associativity (i.e. the jacobi identity) do exist (see sect. vii);
therefore they have to be considered as prefered (correct) ones.

for compact reviews which contain similar topics see [47]-[50].
this paper is organized as follows.

iii the denitions
of the etc according to kallen [34] resp. brandt [35] are given, the single
commutators are calculated using both methods and the results are used in
sect. iv for the calculation of the anomaly.

in sect.

ii resp.

in sect. v resp. vi the double commutators are computed using the kallens
and brandts techniques and the results are used in sect. vii for the discussion
of the failure of the jacobi identity in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions.

2 kallens approach

the technique employed in this section was introduced by kallen [34].
let us consider the function

 (x  y) = h0|j a
f ab

(x)j b

 (y)|0i,

(2.1)

2

where h0| . . . |0i means the vev and

 (x)  (x) a(x),
j a

(2.2)

where  and  a are the dirac and pauli matrices respectively.

inserting the completeness relation between the two currents in (2.1) we

obtain [51],

f ab

h0|j a

(x)|nihn|j b

 (x  y) = xn
= xn
= z d2p eip(xy)gab

(0)|nihn|j b

h0|j a

 (y)|0i

 (0)|0i eip(n)(xy)

 (p)(p0),

where the summation runs over the states with positive energy and

(p(n)  p)h0|j a

(0)|nihn|j b

 (0)|0i.

gab

 (p) = x
pi

p(n)
i =p

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.6)

(2.7)

the many-particle state |ni has total momentum p. gab
or p0 < 0.

 (p) vanishes for p2 < 0

we can nd gab

 (p) using several methods. the simplest one is to notice that
 (p) must be a tensor of rank two with respect to lorentz transformations

gab
and therefore its most general form is

gab

 (p) = aab(p2)g + bab(p2)pp

if the vector current j is conserved, i.e. j  = 0, then gab
we can write the vev of the commutator of the two currents as 1

2 (p2) vanishes and

= (cid:0)p2g  pp(cid:1)gab

1 (p2) + g gab

2 (p2).

(2.5)

(p0) = (p0)  (p0) =

1here we assume (and later we show) that gab

1 (p2) = gba

,

p0

and 2(x  y, m 2) is the pauli-jordan function in two dimensions

2(x  y, m 2) =

1

2 z d2p eip(xy)(p2  m 2)(p0),

with the following familiar properties

0 2(x, m 2) |x0=0 = i(x1),
x
2(x, m 2) |x0=0 = 0.

using (2.8) and (2.9) we can immediately write

for the combination  = 0 and  = 1 we nd

0 (x), j b

h0|(cid:2)j a

0 (y)(cid:3) |0ie.t. = h0|(cid:2)j a
1(cid:3) |0ie.t. = 2z

1 (x), j b

1 (y)(cid:3) |0ie.t. = 0.

dm 2 gab

interchanging the order of the integration in (2.6) is quite legal in our case
because both integrals exist. 2

what remains is to calculate the function gab

1 (p2). from (2.5) one nds

gab

 (p) =(cid:0)p2g  pp(cid:1) gab

1 (p2).

contracting both sides with g, using (2.4) and taking into account that only
the state |ni containing one fermion-antifermion pair (as the currents are free)
contributes we get

gab

3this integral has evidently a singularity for m = 0 which compensates the factor of m2;
m efect is completely analogous to that arising in the dispersive

obviously, such an m 
derivation of the axial anomaly through a relevant imaginary part (c.f. [47]).

3 brandts approach

we dene the etc of the two local operators a(x) and b(y) as [35]

[a(x), b(y)]e.t.  lim

[a(x, ), b(y,  )],

0,0

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

(3.1)

where a(x, ) and b(y,  ) are functions of the renormalized local operators
(x), (x + ) evaluated at time x0 and

a(x) = lim
0

a(x, ); 0 = 0.

we dene the current j(x) as

j(x)  lim
0

j(x, ),

where

j(x, ) 

1

is the point-split current and

2(cid:2) (x)(x + ) + (x + )(x)(cid:3)

  {1, ,    ;  a,   }.

using the above denition and the relation

{a(x), +

b(y)}e.t. = ab(x1  y1)

it is easy to nd the useful identities

[ (x)(y), (z)]e.t. = (x)0(y1  z1),

[ (x)(y), (z)]e.t. = 0(y)(x1  z1),

[ (x)a(y), (z)b(w)]e.t. = (x)a0b(w)(y1  z1) 
 (z)b0a(y)(x1  w1).

(3.2)

now we can directly compute the single commutator of the two currents.

[ja(x, ), jb (y,  )]e.t. =

(3.8)

(3.9)
(3.10)

and the limit    0 was already taken. it is easy to check that the result does
not depend on the order in which we take the limit procedures.

the rst term in (3.8) (after taking the limit   0) is, as we could expect,

the operator of the current.

assuming about the schwinger term that it is a c-number we nd its form

by calculating the vev of the second term in (3.8).

considering that

(3.12)

finally we get the following schwinger terms (s.t.) for the dierent combina-
tions of the matrices

a = 0, b = 1

a = b = 0(1)

a =  a0, b =  b1

a =  a0(1), b =  b0(1)

(3.13)

comparing this with the previous section we observe that both approaches -
kallens and brandts - give the same results.

4 anomaly and schwinger terms

in this section i follow essencialy [36].

the massless schwinger model has on the classical level the gauge respec-
tively the chiral symmetries from which the conservation of the vector respec-
tively the axial vector currents results

x
j (x) = 0,
 j 
y
5 (y) = 0,

5  (x) 5(x),
j 

(4.1)

(4.2)

where

where 5 = 01.

using in these equations and the canonical commutation relations (ccr)

we may formally derive identities like

x
h0|t j (x)j 
 h0|t j (x)j 
y

5 (y)|0i = 0,
5 (y)|0i = 0.

(4.3)

on the quantum level these equations - the vector respectively axial vector ward
identities (vwi resp. awi) - cannot be satised simultaneously [36] and then
we speak about the anomaly respectively the anomalous ward identities.

7

to show it we introduce a covariant two-point green function

g  h0|t j (x)j 

5 (y)|0i.

the t -product is dened for two bose operators a(x) and b(y) as

where

t (cid:0)a(x)b(y)(cid:1)  t(cid:0)a(x)b(y); n)(cid:1) + c(x, y; n) + c(x, y),
t(cid:0)a(x)b(y); n(cid:1)  ([x  y]  n)a(x)b(y) + ([y  x]  n)b(y)a(x)

is the generalized t -product, n is a time-like vector, n2 = 1, c(x, y; n) and
c(x, y) are the so-called contact or seagull terms.4

to nd c(x, y; n) we use the property that t  is independent of n. we get

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(for details see [36])

where

and s(y, n) is given by

c(x, y; n) = c(y; n)2(x  y),

c(y; n) =z dn

 s(y, n)

([x  y]  n)(cid:2)a(x), b(y)(cid:3) = s(y; n)2(x  y) + s(y; n)p2(x  y). (4.9)

p is the spacelike projection operator

p = g  nn.

(4.10)

note that c(y; n) is determined up to an arbitrary function c0(y)!

in the previous sections we have got the complete formulae for the commu-

tators and now we can rewrite them in a more compact and useful form

([x  y]  n)(cid:2)j (x), j  (y)(cid:3) = s;(y; n)p2(x  y),

with

s;(y; n) = s(y)(ng + ng).

for 1+1 dimensions

j 
5 = j

and in case of (4.4) it is easy to nd that 5

c  (x, n) = s(x)nn2(x  y) + c 

0 (x)
4 it is easy to see that for n = (1, 0) we get the ordinary t -product.
5the seagull c(x, y; n) in (4.7) carries two indices ,  now.

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

8

and we get

x

t (cid:0)j (x)j 

5 (y)(cid:1) =(cid:0)c 

0 (y)

x + s(y)

x(cid:1)2(x  y).

now it is clear that if we want to preserve vwi we have to put

c0  (y) = gs(y)

and then awi is broken

on the contrary if we try to preserve awi then vwi will be broken.

y

 t (cid:0)j (x)j 

5 (y)(cid:1) = s(y)y

 2(x  y).

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

from the last equation the connection between the anomaly and the schwinger

term is clear.

in our simple case the schwinger term is reduced to (see (2.17), (4.11))

and so awi is given by

s(x) =

y

 t (cid:0)j (x), j 

5 (y)(cid:1) =

5 double commutators in kallens approach

in the calculation of the double commutators we proceed similarly as in section
2.
let us consider the following double commutator

later with the specic values of a, b and c:

h[ja(x), jb(y)], jc (z)i,

a = 1 a, b = 1 b, c = 1 c.

we introduce the function

the abbreviation ef f means the eective equality, i.e. we drop terms which do
not contribute to the equal time limit. with this remark in mind

where in the last equality we used (a.6) from the appendix. the procedures of
the calculation of the remaining double commutators are practically the same
and we can omit them.

in addition, in the following section we derive the general form (6.1.6) of the
vev of the double commutator of the free current using a simpler formalism.

6 double commutators in brandts approach

here we consider two ways how to calculate the double commutators using
brandts approach. one of them (i will call it the w-way) could violate the
jacobi identity as was shown by banerjee, rothe & rothe [39].

we start from the general form of the single commutator, which we got in

the previous sections

[ja(x), jb(y)]e.t. = (x1  y1)j[a0,b](y) + sabx

1 (x1  y1).

(6.1)

11

we dene the double commutator similarly as the single one (see (3.1))

(cid:2)[ja(x), jb(y)], jc (z)(cid:3)e.t. 

(6.2)
where we use a, resp. b, resp. c as the shorthand notation for a, resp. b,
resp. c .

lim

0,0,0(cid:2)[ja(x, ), jb(y,  )], jc (z,  )(cid:3)e.t.

,

6.1 w-way

the w-way consists in the assumption that we can put the limit procedures
inside the external commutator i.e.

lim

0(cid:2)

lim

0,0

[ja(x, ), jb(y,  )]e.t., jc (z,  )(cid:3)e.t.

and then use (6.1). employing this procedure we can write

(6.1.1)

(cid:2)[ja(x), jb(y)], jc (z)(cid:3)e.t. =(cid:2)(x1y1)j[a0,b](y)+sabx

1 (x1y1), jc (z)(cid:3)e.t.

.
(6.1.2)

assuming that sab is a c-number we nd

(cid:2)[ja(x), jb(y)], jc (z)(cid:3)e.t. = (x1  y1)(y1  z1)j(cid:2)[a0,b]0,c(cid:3)(z) 

sab,c(x1  y1)y

1 (y1  z1),



i

where we introduced the notation

sab,c = tr(cid:26)(cid:8)[a 0, b] 0, c(cid:9)1(cid:27).

a =  a, b =  b, c =  c

for

we obtain

(6.2.1)

where for the case (6.1.5)

abc =  a b c00, cab =  c a b00, . . . .

(6.2.2)

what is really important is to take one of the two internal limits as the last
one, i.e.  or  , otherwise we immediately go back to the w-way. concretely
in (6.2.1) we can put

x = x, y = x + , z = w = y, u = v = z.

(6.2.3)

it is now straightforward but tedious to show that the result is the same as

that obtained by the w-way (see (6.1.3), (6.1.6)).

actually, in the case of 1+1 dimensions it is a little bit redundant to speak
about two ways because both give the same result. but in the following section
we will see their possible dierence.

concluding this section we can say that both methods, i.e. brandts and
kallens, give the same results for the form of the schwinger terms in the double
commutators of the free currents.

7 failure of jacobi identity?

in the previous section we have got the following general formula for the double
commutator

(cid:2)[ja(x), jb(y)], jc (z)(cid:3)e.t. = (x1  y1)(y1  z1)j(cid:2)[a0,b]0,c(cid:3)(z) 

sab,c(x1  y1)y

1 (y1  z1),



i

where the form of sab,c is given by (6.1.4).

(7.1)

13

now using the identities

(x1  y1)(y  z)j(cid:2)[a0,b]0,c(cid:3)(z) +
+(y1  z1)(z  x)j(cid:2)[b0,c]0,a(cid:3)(x) +
+(z1  x1)(x  y)j(cid:2)[c 0,a]0,b(cid:3)(y) = 0 ,

(x1  y1)y
+(y1  z1)z
+(z1  x1)x

1 (y1  z1) +
1 (z1  x1) +
1 (x1  y1) = 0

and

sab,c = sbc,a = sca,b ,

(7.2)

(7.3)

(7.4)

it is easy to see that the jacobi identity is fullled.

the jacobi identity for the free currents cannot be broken in 1+1 dimensions

because both ways - w and c - leads to the same results.

as an illustration that it does not have to be always true, i mention an

example given in [39] in which these two procedures do give dierent results.

we consider the jacobi identity for the operators j i(x), j j(y), j 0

5 (z) in 3+1

dimensions.6
because of

[j 0

5 (x), j j (y)]e.t. = 0,

[j i(y), j j(z)]e.t. = 2iijkj5 k(y)3(y  z),

(7.5)

8 conclusion

(7.14)

i considered the single and double commutators of free currents in a 1+1 di-
mensional quantum eld theory. in order to shed more light on their properties
i used two methods to perform the calculation, kallens and brandts, which
are mathematically rigorous and elegant.

using these results i determined the anomalous axial vector ward identity
and showed the correct way of the regularization of the double commutators
which does not violate the jacobi identity.

15

i hope that the statement from introduction was claried in this paper and
i just work on improvements of point-splitting (brandts) method in higher
dimensions.
