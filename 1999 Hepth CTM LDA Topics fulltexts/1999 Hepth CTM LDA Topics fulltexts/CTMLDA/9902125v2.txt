abstract

we construct an explicit solution of type-iib supergravity describing the strong coupling
regime of a non-supersymmetric gauge theory. the latter has a running coupling with
an ultraviolet stable xed point corresponding to the n = 4 su(n) super-yangmills
theory at large n. the running coupling has a power law behaviour, argued to be
universal, that is consistent with holography. around the critical point, our solution
denes an asymptotic expansion for the gauge coupling beta-function. we also calculate
the rst correction to the coulombic quarkantiquark potential.

1 introduction and computations

one of the well-known vacua of the type-iib supergravity theory is the ads5  s5 one,
rst described in [1]. the non-vanishing elds are the metric and the anti-self-dual ve-
form f5. the latter is given by the freundrubin-type ansatz, which is explicitly written
as

 ,

f =

and is clearly anti-self-dual. this background has received a lot of attention recently
because of its conjectured connection to n = 4 su(n) super-yangmills (sym) theory
at large n [2, 3]. the sym coupling gym is given, in terms of the dilaton , as g2
ym =
4e, and the t hooft coupling is g2
ymn, where n = rs 5 f5 is the ux of the
ve-form through the s5. the dilaton is constant in this background, which is related to
the niteness of the n = 4 sym theory.

h = g2

in order to make contact with qcd, it is important to investigate deformations
of the sym theory that break conformal invariance and supersymmetry. in this case,
the couplings are running corresponding to a non-constant dilaton in the supergravity
side. it is then clear that the background we are after is a perturbation of ads5  s5.
attempts to nd supergravity backgrounds that allow a non-constant dilaton, and hence
a running coupling of the ym theory, have been exploited within type-0 theories [4][6].
deformations of the n = 4 theory, which ow to an interacting conformal xed point,
have been considered in [7].

the purpose of the present paper is to show that running couplings are also possible
within the type-iib string theory. we will study the minimal case, that is we will
keep the same f5 form as in (1) and turn on a non-constant dilaton. we will show that
such a solution, which breaks supersymmetry and conformal invariance, exists. we will
assume for the metric four-dimensional poincare invariance iso(1, 3), since we would
like a gauge theory dened on minkowski space-time. in addition, we will preserve the
original so(6) symmetry of the ads5  s5. as a result, the iso(1, 3) so(6) invariant
ten-dimensional metric is of the form1

ds2 = gdxdx + gijdxidxj ,

where

gdxdx = 2()(d2 + dxdx) ,

(2)
and gij is the metric on s5. the dilaton, by iso(1, 3)  so(6) invariance, can only be
a function of . the supergravity equations turn out to be

 = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,

1supersymmetric solutions to type-iib supergravity which, however, do not preserve the poincare

invariance in the brane world-volume have been found in [8].

the above equation is automatically solved for a ve-sphere of radius 2/ and a rst
integral of the dilaton equation in (3) is

where a is a dimensionful integration constant. moreover, the non-zero components of
the ricci tensor for the metric (2) are

where 0 is another constant of integration. the dierent overall signs in the right-hand
side of (8) arise from taking the square root in (7). we impose the boundary condition
that the space described by (2) becomes ads5 when   0+. that means that the
conformal factor should assume the form   r/ for small , where r  (4gsn)1/4.
using well-known formulae for the hypergeometric functions, we see that this naturally
leads to the choice of the minus sign in (8) and also xes  = 4/r2. in addition, the
constants a and 0 are related by

the form of the above solution is dictated by the fact that, in the limit 0  , the

there is a singularity that may be easily seen by computing the ricci scalar using (3).
the latter is r = 1

may consider our solution only as an asymptotic expansion around the ads5 geometry

to a very good approximation, except when  takes values very close to 0. then we
may use, to a very good approximation as well, (11) instead of (15), and the results are
plotted in g. 1. note that our analysis was done in the einstein frame and it is not
dicult to translate everything into the string frame by multiplying the einstein metric
by e/2. our solution is singular at  = 0 in both frames and can, indeed, be trusted
away from that point.

note that, the metric (2) with the conformal factor  specied by (10) can be written

in horospherical coordinates3 (r, x) determined by ()d = dr, as

corresponding to the n = 4 su (n ) sym at large n , our solution describes gauge theories that are not
s-duality-invariant. also in (12) we have used (14) below.

2 running coupling

in the ads/cft scheme, the dependence of the bulk elds on the radial coordinate 
may be interpreted as energy dependence. in fact, it is a general feature in the ads/cft
scheme that long (short) distances in the ads space correspond to high (low) energies
in the cft [2, 9]. in particular, if the dilaton in the supergravity side is a function of
, then the t hooft coupling of the boundary cft has an energy dependence and can
be interpreted as the running coupling of the cft. running coupling means of course
that we are away from conformality; thus, backgrounds that admit non-constant dilaton
correspond to non-conformal eld theories. as long as supersymmetry is unbroken, spin-
sum rules for the ads supersymmetry are expected to protect the t hooft coupling
gh of the boundary n = 4 ym theory against running. however, if supersymmetry is
broken, there are then no more cancellations between fermionic and bosonic contributions
leading to the running of gh. the specic background we found here clearly breaks

4

supersymmetry, and

(19)

are the associated fermionic zero modes. if we now follow the correspondence between
long-distances/high-energies in the ads/cft scheme, we nd that the dual theory of
the supergravity solution we obtained has a coupling with power-law running. indeed,
by changing the variable  = r2/u and interpreting u as the energy of the boundary
eld theory, we nd from (12) the running of gh:

however, the above equation does not specify the beta-function, but rather its derivative

ym is a uv-stable xed point.4 we believe that (22) is universal,
which means that g 
namely, that it is valid for all models that approach ads5  s5 at some boundary.
this can be seen by recalling that, near ads5  s5, the dilaton always satises (3)
with  = r/. as a result,  will behave as e0  4, where 0 is the value of
 at  = 0. we also see that (21) determines the second and third derivatives of the
coupling beta-function at the xed point, which, however, are not expected to be model-
independent. let us also note that there is no known perturbative eld theory with
uv-stable xed points. a behaviour of the form (20), namely power-law running of the
couplings, was also found in type-0 theories (see second ref. in [6]), in gauge theories in
higher dimensions [10] and extensively discussed in gauge-coupling unication in theories
with large internal dimensions [11][14].
in this scenario, the internal dimensions are
shown up in the four-dimensional theory as the massive kk modes. these modes can
run in the loops of the four-dimensional theory, giving rise to a power law running of
the couplings. in particular, for d large extra dimensions and for energies e above the
infrared cuto, which is specied by the mass scale  of the extra dimensions, we nd,
just for dimensional reasons, that the running coupling constant of the eective four-
dimensional theory is of the form g(4)g(4)
is the bare coupling.
thus, in our case, since we have a four-dimensional theory coming from ten dimensions,
we should expect the coupling to run in the sixth power of e. instead, we nd here that
the coupling depends on the fourth power of u = e, indicating that when holography is
involved, we get a softer running of the couplings.

it is possible to identify those operators that are responsible for the running of the
coupling in the boundary eld theory. since the dilaton approaches a constant value at
 = 0 and the asymptotic background is an ads5 space, the corresponding boundary eld
theory is expected to be a deformation of the n = 4 su(n) supersymmetric ym theory.
the explicit form of the deformation may be specied by recalling that our solution still
has an so(6) symmetry. there are not many so(6) singlets in the spectrum of the s5
compactication. in fact, from the results in [15] we see that the only scalar singlets are
the complex scalar of type-iib theory b, aijkl and hi
h = 32
in ads-mass units. since we have not perturbed the ve-form f5, aijkl = 0 and thus the
perturbations we have turned on are the real part of b and hi
i. from their masses we
nd that the former corresponds to marginal deformations of the type f 2
, while the
latter corresponds, to the dimension-eight operator f 4
, which is irrelevant. however, it
gives contributions to the boundary eld theory since we have an ir cuto specied by
0. sending 0   all bulk perturbations disappear and, similarly, the boundary eld
theory turns out to be the n = 4 large-n su(n) sym theory.

3 the quarkantiquark potential

the breaking of the superconformal invariance of the n = 4 theory by our solution
should be apparent in the expression for the quarkantiquark potential, which we now
compute along the lines of [16, 17]. we will nd corrections to the purely coulombic
behaviour, which, on purely dimensional grounds, we expect to be in powers of al4,
where l is the quarkantiquark distance. we are eventually interested in the rst such
correction, which, as is apparent when comparing (14) with (12), is due to the dilaton,
but for the moment we keep the formalism general. as usual, we have to minimize the
nambugoto action

s =

1

2 z d d qdet (gm n x m x n ) ,

(24)

where gm n is the target-space metric in the string frame. for the static conguration
x0 =  , x1  x = , and x2, x3 as well as the coordinates of s5 held xed, we nd that
(24) becomes (we use the notation of [16])

s =

t

2 z dx e/2q(xu)2 + u 4/r4 ,

(25)

where e  e4 and  = 1 +p

0u )8n is the function multiplying r/ in (14)
(rewritten using  = r2/u). it is clear that any background that approaches ads5 will
always have a  of the form (14), so that our analysis is quite general at this point. it is
easy to see that the solution is expressed as

n=1 an(cid:16) r2

x = z u

u0

r2du

u 2qe0u 4/u 4

0  1/r4

,

(26)

where u0 is the smallest distance of the trajectory to the center and 0 is the value
of the function  evaluated at u0. we assume that one of the branes is taken out to
u =  and that the string conguration starts and ends at this brane. the rest of the
branes are located at u = r2/0. setting x = l/2 corresponds to u = . in turn, this
gives a condition that relates u0 to l as

l = 2z 

u0

r2du

u 2qe0u 4/u 4

0  1/r4

.

(27)

proceeding in a standard fashion, we substitute back our solution (26) into the action (25)
and obtain an integral that is innity. this is because we have included into the potential
energy the (equal) masses of the innitely heavy (in the supergravity approximation)
quark and antiquark. in order to compute these masses, we assume that n-branes are
at u = r2/0 and 1 at u = umax that is assumed to be large but nite. the mass of a
single quark is computed if in (25) we consider a conguration with x0 =  , u =  and
with xed spatial world-volume coordinates x,  = 1, 2, 3, as well as s5 coordinates.
then the self-energy of the quark is

(29)

at this point we have to solve (27) for u0 as a function of l and substitute the result
back into (29) to obtain eq q as a function of l only. this can be done perturbatively
in powers of l/0, and we are interested in the rst correction to the coulombic law
behaviour of the potential. as explained, the correction due to the non-constant dilaton
is dominant and we will therefore use  = r/, which corresponds to ads5  s5 for the
string metric, whereas for the string coupling we will keep the rst two terms in (12).
then we nd that

(32)

we see that the coulombic potential receives a correction proportional to l3 due to the
breaking of conformal invariance.5 this is remarkably similar to the potential obtained in
[18] for the quarkantiquark pair for n = 4, at nite temperature, using the near-horizon
supergravity solution for n coincident d3-branes. however, in that case supersymmetry
is broken by thermal eects, whereas in our case it is broken, by the presence of a non-
trivial dilaton, even at zero temperature. the last term in (32) does not depend on l
and represents a constant shift of the potential energy.

as a nal remark we note that the computation of the potential for the monopole
antimonopole pair proceeds along the same lines as that for the quarkantiquark pair,
with the only dierence that we start, similarly to [19], with the action for a d-string.
this means that the integrand in (25) should be multiplied by e. hence, the function
e entering into (25) is dened as e = e4. consequently, the rst correction to the
coulombic behaviour of the monopoleantimonopole potential is given by

8

which is the same as (32) after we use the fact that under s-duality gs  1/gs and s  s.
hence we see a screening (antiscreening) of the quarkantiquark pair for s = +1(1) and
exactly the opposite behaviour for the monopoleantimonopole pair.
