abstract

guided by the generalized conformal symmetry, we investigate the extension of ads-cft

correspondence to the matrix model of d-particles in the large n limit. we perform

a complete harmonic analysis of the bosonic linearized uctuations around a heavy d-

particle background in iia supergravity in 10 dimensions and nd that the spectrum

precisely agrees with that of the physical operators of matrix theory. the explicit forms

of two-point functions give predictions for the large n behavior of matrix theory with

some special cuto. we discuss the possible implications of our results for the large n

dynamics of d-particles and for the matrix-theory conjecture. we nd an anomalous scal-

ing behavior with respect to the large n limit associated to the innite momentum limit

in 11 dimensions, suggesting the existence of a screening mechanism for the transverse

extension of the system.

introduction

the so-called ads-cft correspondence [1][2][3] is originated from the comparison of two

dierent but dual descriptions of d-branes, namely as classical bps solutions of eective

supergravity in the low-energy limit of closed superstring theory and a direct treatment

of dirichlet branes as collective degrees of freedom in open superstring theory, whose low-

energy limit are eectively some conformal eld theories describing the lowest modes of

open strings. from the viewpoint of closed string theories or supergravity, the system is

a eld theory in the bulk space-time, while in the viewpoint of the world-volume theory

of dirichlet branes the system is regarded as a eld theory dened on a boundary of the

bulk space-time.

in the most typical case of ads5 s5, the correspondence has been used to make
various predictions for the behavior of 3+1 dimensional super conformal yang-mills theory
in the large n limit in its strong coupling regime g2
ymn  1. for example, the masses
of eld excitations around the conformal invariant ads background are related [2] [3] to

the conformal dimensions of the physical operators of super yang-mills theory. indeed

the agreement between them is regarded as a strongest piece of evidence for the validity

of the ads-cft correspondence.

it should be stressed that the conformal symmetry plays a crucial role for establishing

the connection between the correlation functions based on the ansatz proposed in [2] and

[3], where yang-mills theory is assumed to live on the boundary of the ads space-time.

in the original discussion in [1], use of yang-mills theory is justied as the description of

d-brane interactions whose distance scales are much smaller than the string scale s, by
xing the energy u = r/2

s of open strings in the limit of small s, where, as is now well
known, the higher string modes can be neglected. on the side of supergravity, this allows
us to take the near-horizon limit which approximates 1 + gsn4
su 4 by
gsn/4
su 4. however, in the prescriptions of [2] and [3], we have to consider the boundary
of the near horizon region by taking the limit u  . obviously, this tacitly assumes
that we can extend the correspondence of both descriptions up to the region where the
su 4  1 or r 
near-horizon approximation begins to lose its justication, namely gsn/4
(gsn)1/4s  s. this length scale exceeds the naive region of validity of the yang-mills

s/r4 = 1 + gsn/4

2

description for the dynamics of open strings. a possible support for this extension of the

region seems to be the conformal symmetry: once the correspondence is established at

suciently small distance scales, one can enlarge it to larger distance scales to the extent
that the conformal symmetry is valid on both sides. the condition r < (gsn)1/4s places
the limit for the validity of this assumption from the side of supergravity. thus the basic

assumption behind the ads-cft correspondence is that the correspondence between

classical supergravities and yang-mills matrix models (or any appropriate conformal eld

theories) is extended to the whole conformal region characterized by the near-horizon
condition. assuming this feature, the limit s  0 is not essential and we can adopt any
convenient unit of length for discussing the ads-cft correspondence.

the conformal symmetry can also be used to constrain [1] the dynamics of (probe)

d-branes themselves in the ads background.

it has been shown that the conformal

symmetries on supergravity side and on super yang-mills side can be directly related
from this point of view. for example, the characteristic scale (gsn)1/4s is shown to be

obtained [4] from the side of yang-mills theory without relying upon the correspondence

with supergravity. the deeper meanings behind these conformal symmetries have been

discussed from dierent viewpoints [5][6]. for instance, the space-time uncertainty relation

[8] has been the motivation for extending the conformal symmetry to general d-branes in

ref. [7].

it has been discussed [9] that the correspondence between supergravity and super

yang-mills theories may be extended to other dirichlet branes of dierent dimensions

which are not necessarily described by conformally invariant eld theory. from the view-

point of the conformal symmetry, it was argued in [7] [10] that a certain extended version

of conformal symmetry exists for general d-branes. the extended symmetry indeed is

shown to be as eective for constraining the dynamics of probe d-branes in the back-

ground of heavy d-brane sources as in the case of ordinary conformally invariant theory.

some aspects of the generalized conformal symmetry have been studied [11] from a variety

of dierent viewpoints.

the aim of the present work is rst to substantiate the previous discussions of the gen-

eralized conformal symmetry by establishing the correspondence between the excitation

spectrum in supergravity around the background of a heavy d0 source and the physical

3

operators in supersymmetric quantum mechanical model describing d-particles, namely,

matrix theory. we conrm that they behave as expected from the generalized confor-

mal symmetry. secondly, and more importantly, supergravity guided by the generalized

conformal symmetry enables us to predict the explicit forms for the correlators of matrix

theory operators in a certain special regime of the large n limit. we will discuss the

implications of our results for the dynamics of many d-particle systems and for matrix

theory from both the viewpoints of discrete light-cone quantization for nite and xed

n and of the large n innite momentum frame. we nd some unexpected anomalous

behaviors in the scaling properties in the large n limit.

it might be worthwhile to add a remark here. one of the unsolved problems in matrix

theory is to establish whether the model is consistent with 11 dimensional supergravity

which is regarded as the low-energy description of m-theory. since 10 dimensional iia

supergravity is the dimensional reduction of 11 dimensional supergravity, one might think

that invoking supergravity-matrix model correspondence almost amounts to assuming the

result. but that is not correct. the yang-mils matrix model is intrinsically dened only

in 10 dimensional space-time, and therefore it is not at all evident what is the appropriate

interpretation of the theory from the viewpoint of 11 dimensional m-theory. we can in

principle test the idea of matrix theory by checking whether or not the behavior of the

matrix model in the large n limit predicted by the generalized ads-cft correspondence

supports the interpretation of the model as being dened at the innite momentum frame

in 11 dimensional space-time.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we briey summarize the m-theory

interpretation of the d0-brane matrix model and review the generalized conformal sym-

metry: although most of which has already been discussed in previous works [7, 4, 10],

we hope that our discussion is useful for the purpose of clarication. we then analyze

the possible regime of validity in which we can expect the correspondence between super-

gravity and the yang-mills description of d-particles in the large n limit. in particular,
we emphasize that we have to set an infrared cuto of the order (gsn)1/7s in the strong
coupling region gsn > 1 of the large n limit in applying the correspondence. in section 3,

we present the results of a complete harmonic analysis of the bosonic excitations around

the classical d-particle solution in type iia supergravity in 10 dimensions. in section 4,

4

using the results obtained in the previous section, we discuss the correspondence of the

matrix model operators with the supergravity uctuations, and the possible implications

of the results from the viewpoint of matrix-theory interpretation. in appendix, we give

a brief summary of the denitions and basic properties of the general tensor harmonics.

2. generalized conformal symmetry and the large n limit in d0-matrix

model

let us start from the standard matrix model action for d-particles

s = z dt tr(cid:16) 1

[xi, xj]2

(2.1)

where xi (i = 1, 2, . . . , 9) are the n  n hermitian matrices representing the collective
modes of n d-particles coupled with the lowest modes of open strings. in the present

paper, we will use the a = 0 gauge. the diagonal elements of the coordinate matrices xi

are interpreted as the 9 dimensional spatial positions of the d0-branes in 10 dimensional

space-time. alternatively, the same action can be interpreted [12] as the eective action

for the lowest kk-mode of the graviton supermultiplet in 11 dimensional space-time in the
innite-momentum frame where the light-like momentum p = 1
2(p0  p10) is quantized
by the unit 1/r with r = gss being the compactication radius along the 11th (space-

like) dimension. for the 11 dimensional interpretation, it is more natural to rewrite the

lagrangian as

l = tr(cid:16) 1

(2.3)

(2.4)

using the 11 dimensional planck length p = g1/3
s s. for any xed nite gs, the innite
momentum limit p   requires to take the large n limit. the form of the hamil-
tonian implies that for the innite momentum limit for nite gs to be meaningful, the

5

spectrum of the operator tr h in the large n limit must scale as 1/n in the low-energy

(near threshold) region. in other words, the time must scale as n. therefore it is im-

portant to analyze the large-time behavior of appropriate correlators for the study of

the matrix-theory conjecture. the usual discussion [14] for justifying matrix theory at

nite n [13] only deals with the (spatial) length scale smaller than the string scale. for

example, such an argument is insucient to explain the results [15] [16] of the explicit

computations of d-particle scattering beyond one-loop approximation, in which the per-

turbative approximation becomes better and better for larger distance scales. one of the

most crucial issues of matrix theory is to understand whether the theory can describe

gravity consistently at large distance scales either in the nite n or in the large n limit.

the space-time scaling property of d-particles [17] can be qualitatively summarized

into an uncertainty relation in space-time [8]

t x  2
s,

(2.5)

between the minimum uncertainties t and x with respect to time and space, respec-

tively. this relation is invariant under the opposite scaling of time and space

xi(t)  x 

i(t) = xi(t),

t  t = 1t .

(2.6)

the matrix model action is invariant under these scaling transformations if the string

coupling is scaled as

gs  g

s = 3gs.

(2.7)

the scaling of the string coupling is just equivalent to the fact that the characteristic
spatial and time scales of the theory are g1/3

s, respectively, apart

s s = p and g1/3

s

from dimensionless but string-coupling independent proportional constant. this can be

derived by combining the space-time uncertainty relation with the ordinary quantum

mechanical uncertainty relations. the space-time uncertainty relation may be regarded

as a simple but universally valid underlying principle [8] governing the short distance

space-time structure of string/m theory. in [7], we have pointed out that the symmetry

of the model and the space-time uncertainty relation can be extended to the special

conformal transformation,

kxi = 2txi, kt = t2, kgs = 6tgs.

(2.8)

6

these symmetries are appropriate to be called as generalized conformal symmetry.

the same scaling properties exist on the side of supergravity solution too. from the

point of view of 10 dimensional type iia theory, the solution is expressed as

10 = e2 /3dt2 + e2 /3dx2

(2.12)

and the charge q is given by q = 603()7/2gsn for n coincident d-particles.
in the
near horizon limit q/r7  1 where the factor 1 + q/r7 is replaced by q/r7, the metric,
dilaton and the 1-form a0dt are all invariant under the scale and the special conformal

transformations

r  r, t  1t, gs  3gs,

kt = (t2 +

2q
5r5 ),

kr = 2tr,

kgs = 6tgs

(2.13)

(2.14)

which together with time translation form an so(1, 2) algebra. the additional term in

the special conformal transformation does not aect the space-time uncertainty relation,

but plays an important role [7] in constraining the eective action of a probe d-particle
in the background metric (2.9). the mechanism how the additional term 2q

5r5 emerges in
the bulk theory was claried in refs. [4, 10] for general case of dp -branes from the point

of view of matrix models, namely, from the boundary theory. it should be emphasized
that the new scale q1/7  (gsn)1/7s which characterizes the radius of the near horizon
region around the system of the source d-particles was thus derived entirely within the

logic of yang-mills matrix models. this may be regarded as independent evidence for the

dual correspondence between supergravity and yang-mills matrix models.

as noted in previous works, the combination gs/r3 is invariant under the generalized

conformal transformation, and hence the d0 space-time metric can be regarded as a
sort of quasi ads2 s8 with a variable but conformally invariant radius proportional to
s/r3)1/4s  (qe )1/7. equivalently, the d0 metric in the near horizon limit is

(2.15)

(2.16)

this representation will be technically useful for performing the harmonic analysis in the

next section. however, we have to be careful in considering the generalized conformal

transformation using this metric, since the coordinate transformation (2.16) involves q

which is not constant under the conformal transformation. in particular, the symmetry

is not the isometry under any coordinate transformation. for example, taking derivative

and performing the generalized conformal transformation are not commutative. to avoid

possible confusions caused by this subtlety, it is safe to return to the original coordinate r

whenever we discuss the conformal transformation of the elds. note that in this picture

the weyl noninvariance of the theory, or the nonconformal nature of the theory, is canceled

by the transformation of the string coupling constant. in other words, the weyl factor

itself is treated as being invariant under the generalized conformal transformation.

whether the transformations being accompanied by the change of the string coupling

constant should be called as a symmetry transformation may perhaps be a matter of

debate. our viewpoint is that the above transformations must be interpreted in the

whole moduli space of the vacua of perturbative string/m theory. the change of the

string coupling (namely, the asymptotic value of the dilaton expectation value or the

asymptotic value of the compactication radius along the 11th dimension) is interpreted

as a change of the vacuum at innity. the conformal transformation is a symmetry

characterizing the short distance property of the theory, but it must be accompanied by

a change of vacuum at large distance asymptotic region, depending on the d-brane states

we are considering. note that the linear time dependence of the dilaton to its rst order

is an allowed deformation of the vacuum in the at space-time. ultimately, the string

coupling should be eliminated from the fundamental nonperturbative formulation of the

theory.

it is also worthwhile to point out that the scaling transformation of the generalized

conformal symmetry is related to the discrete light-cone interpretation of the model with

xed n in the sense that the transformation is equivalent with the boost transformation,

8

t  2t, r  2r, xi  xi, p  p and s  1s, when we use the unit such
that the 11 dimensional planck length is xed by changing the unit of length globally.

alternatively, we can use the unit such that the time is not changed. this leads to
the transformation t  t, r  4r, xi  2xi, p  2p and s  s. the latter
transformation is nothing but the redenition proposed in [14].

given now that there exists the same generalized conformal symmetry on both sides of

the matrix model and supergravity, we can dene the conformal dimensions of operators

on both sides and consider the correspondence between the spectra of both sides by

following the familiar prescription [2] [3] of computing the correlators of the matrix model

using supergravity. let us analyze the region of validity for the correspondence.

throughout the present paper, we will use the unit of length in which the string scale

s is xed, instead of the familiar convention of xing the energy of the open strings

stretched among d-branes. first for the supergravity approximation to be good, the

curvature radius  must be larger than the string scale giving

while the near horizon condition gives

r  (gsn)1/3s,

r  (gsn)1/7s

(2.17)

(2.18)

if we further require that the eective string coupling which can be determined locally by

the dilaton is small, we must have also

g1/3
s n 1/7s = g4/21

s

(gsn)1/7s  r

(2.19)

which essentially demands that the eective local compactication radius along 11th di-

mensions must be smaller than the string scale. this is necessary as long as we use the

10 dimensional supergravity picture. since the last two conditions (2.18) and (2.19) both

have the same behavior with respect to n, the existence of nite region of validity for

the correspondence always require that the string coupling constant must be very small
gs  1. this is especially true if one wishes to justify the yang-mills description of
open strings which requires to go to much shorter distances than the string scale. note

that the characteristic length scale of elementary processes of d-particle interactions is

9

always expected to be g1/3

s s. on the other hand, the rst two conditions tell us that
the extent to which the region of validity extends in the large distances depends crucially

on whether gsn > 1 or gsn < 1. in the former strong coupling region, we have to put
the infrared cuto at r  (gsn)1/7s, while in the the latter weak coupling region that is
r  (gsn)1/3s. from the point of view of matrix theory in which we wish to investigate
the large-n dynamics for xed gs, the former restriction is problematical, since it is ex-

pected from a general argument [22] based on the virial theorem that the typical extension
of the system of n d-particles is (gsn)1/3s( (gsn)1/7s) for large gsn. we will come
to this question later. to summarize, we must be in the region of small string coupling
constant and large n such that gsn  1, in order to go beyond the string scale r > s
on the basis of the ads-cft type correspondence between supergravity and yang-mills

matrix models. it is also important to recall the remark which was already stressed in

the introduction, when we consider the whole near-horizon region (or conformal region)
till its limit characterized by (gsn)1/7s  s. this is also necessary for studying the
matrix-theory conjecture. on the other hand, as far as we remain in the weak coupling

region gsn < 1, the region of validity of the supergravity-matrix model correspondence

is restricted in the region below the string scale even if we take the large n limit.

if we take the viewpoint of 11 dimensional m-theory and x the planck length p =
g1/3
s s, the near horizon condition is r  g4/21
n 1/7p which contains the small curvature
region r  n 1/3p for suciently small string coupling for any xed n. however, in the
large n limit, these two infrared conditions can compete depending on the magnitude

s

of gsn as explained above. remember that in the case of d3 brane the infrared cuto

associated with the small curvature condition and that coming from the near horizon
condition are governed by the same scale r  (gsn)1/4s  s, in sharp contrast to the
case of d-particles. in passing, the condition that the nonvanishing components of 11
dimensional riemann tensor ( ij(q/r7)) around the d0-metric are small compared to
the characteristic curvature 2

p is

g5/27
s n 1/9s  r

(2.20)

which is weaker than the 10 dimensional condition (2.19) only when n is bigger than
 g14/3

. therefore we have to keep in mind that unless the latter condition is satised

s

10

it could be dangerous to elevate the classical 10 dimensional supergravity to classical 11

dimensional supergravity. in particular, this shows that in the  t hooft limit in which
we x gsn in taking the limit n  , we cannot lift up the theory to 11 dimensions,
while, if we take the large n limit with a xed but small gs, the 11 dimensional picture

enables us to go beyond the 10 dimensional lower bound (2.19). this will be relevant for

the discussion of the matrix-theory conjecture at the end of the present paper.

3. harmonic analysis on d-particle background in type iia supergravity

the idea behind the prescription [2] [3] for computing the correlators of the yang-mills

theory using supergravity is as follows. suppose we study the system of a heavy source of

n d-branes by putting a light d-brane far away (i.e., outside the near horizon region)

from the source as a probe. thus we are considering the u(n + 1) yang-mills theory
broken down to u(n)u(1). on the side of supergravity, the eect of the probe can be
treated as a perturbation around the background of the source d-branes. for the inner

region near to the horizon, information on a given state of the probe can be encoded
into the boundary condition {hi} for the independent set of the perturbing elds at the
boundary of the near horizon region. from the yang-mills viewpoint, on the other hand,

the perturbing elds produced by the probe should be coupled at the boundary to some

independent set of operators of the yang-mills theory describing the source d-branes.

this leads to the ansatz for the correlators of the yang-mills operators in euclidean

metric, as

essg[h] = hexp{z dtxi

hi(t)oi(t)}iu (n ),

(3.1)

where ssg[h] is the supergravity action as the functional of the boundary value of the

perturbing elds. although it is not literally correct to say that either the source or probe

d-branes do reside at the boundary, we can interpret the relation (3.1) as if the u(n)

yang-mills theory describing the source d-branes lives on the boundary. the conformal

symmetries on both sides allow us to diagonalize the operators and the perturbing elds

with respect to the conformal dimensions.

in this section, we perform the diagonalization of the perturbing elds on the side of

supergravity by carrying out the harmonic analysis of the linearized perturbations around

11

the d0 background. the calculation follows essentially the same method as in the case of
non-dilatonic branes. see [18] for the typical case of ads5  s5. in the present paper, we
only treat the bosonic perturbations. the reader who cannot be patient in following the

details of the harmonic analysis might want to skip the rest of this section and directly go

to section 4 where we discuss the correspondence between the spectrum of the uctuations

and the matrix model operators and its implications.

let us start from the standard iia supergravity action in 10 dimensions using the

da3, f4 = f4  a1  h3, f2 = da1. note also that |fp|2 = f12pf 12p/p!. the
nontrivial background elds exist for the metric, dilaton and rr 1-form elds. although

this is not compulsory,  it is convenient for the harmonic analysis to make the weyl

and decompose the elds as g(total)

transformation (2.15) for the metric. we denote the metric of the transformed frame by
g(total)

metric in the ads frame by g and the uctuation by h. for other elds similarly, we
denote the background elds by using the original notation as , a and the uctuations
around them by putting hat such as , a. after the weyl transformation the action
takes the form

= g + h. namely, we denote the background

3.1 the uctuations of metric, dilaton and rr 1-form elds

we rst consider the uctuations of the metric, dilaton and rr 1-form eld, since other

elds without the nontrivial background elds are decoupled from them. the linearized

we have explicitly conrmed that the nal results for the dimensions and correlators are the same

as those obtained using the metric without making the weyl transformation.

they are obtained by the variations of dilaton, metric, and rr 1-form elds, respectively.

from now on unless otherwise specied, we use the following conventions for denoting

the tensor indices: , , . . . for full 10 dimensional contractions. i, j, . . . for the metric on
the sphere s8. thus, for example, the covariant derivative di is dened using only the
ads is that the s8 metric is
metric of s8. the convenience of the ads frame metric ds2
completely decoupled from that of ads2. note however that our background is never the
ads2 s8 itself: the weyl factor induces complicated couplings between various modes,

13

in contrast to the case of non-dilatonic d-branes where we can link the computations

to the representation theory of (super) conformal algebra, and makes our analysis fairly

nontrivial. unfortunately, no analysis has been done on the group-theoretic aspect of the

generalized (super) conformal symmetry.

to analyze the spectrum it is necessary to x the gauge. we adopt the following gauge

conditions anticipating the simplicity of the harmonic expansion,

di(hi

dih0

8

j 
i = dihz

i = 0,

i
jhk

k) = 0,

(3.7)

di ai = 0.

the reader should refer to appendix for the connection of these gauge conditions and

the harmonic expansion. the number of the elds are originally 1(dilaton) +55 (met-

ric)+10(rr 1-form). there are 10(metric)+1(rr 1-form) constraints coming from the

eld equations. the gauge conditions (3.7) eliminates 8 + 2 + 1 = 11 components. thus
we have 66  2  11 = 44 physical components. the result of the harmonic analysis on
s8 will show that for generic value of angular momentum there is one radial degree of

freedom for the symmetric divergenceless and traceless tensor, two for the divergenceless

vector and three for scalar, which indeed sum up to 44 total degrees of freedom.

using the standard general theory of tensor spherical harmonics, we can expand the

uctuations as

hz

h0

0(t, z)y (xi),

0(x) = x b0
z(t, z)y (xi),
z(x) = x bz
a0(x) = x a0(t, z)y (xi),

hi

h0

z(t, z)y (xi),

z(x) = x b0
i(t, z)y (xi),
i(x) = x bi
az(x) = x az(t, z)y (xi),

(x) = x (t, z)y (xi),

h0

i (x) = x b0(t, z)yi(xi),

hz

i (x) = x bz(t, z)yi(xi),

ai(x) = x a(t, z)yi(xi),

jhk

k(x) = x b(t, z)yij(xi).

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

we note that the gauge conditions (3.7) eliminate the possible contributions coming from

the derivatives of the harmonics with lower number of tensor indices. here, y, yi and yij
are the scalar, vector and symmetric-traceless tensor harmonics of s8, respectively. note

also that we have suppressed the angular momentum index  in the harmonic expansion.

see appendix.

it is appropriate to classify the coecient functions in these expansions into the fol-

lowing three categories : (1) scalar components (3.8), (2) vector components (3.9) and

(3) tensor components (3.10). since these harmonic functions are mutually independent

(orthogonal to each other), the linearized equations can be separated into the coecient

equations for each harmonic functions. there arise 16 coecient equations. the equation

for tensor components b is a single equation which is the symmetric traceless tensor part

of the equation (3.5)

in these equations, t , v and s are the eigenvalues of the scalar laplacian on s8 on
the tensor, vector and scalar harmonics respectively

a = ( + 7) + na,

(3.27)

with nt = 2, nv = 1 and ns = 0.

let us now analyze the spectrum using these equations. first, we treat the symmetric

traceless tensor mode b. the equation is already diagonalized as given in (3.11) which
is solved by modied bessel functions. the solution in the euclidean space-time (t 
i, m  i) which is regular at the origin is
5 (2+7)(z) ei

( = 2, 3, . . .).

(3.28)

b = z

5 k 1

7

for the vector modes, we shall rst analyze the special case  = 1. we have 3 equa-
tions (3.12), (3.13) and (3.15) for 3 variables b0, bz, a. however, there is a residual gauge
symmetry corresponding to the killing vector on s8

0 = z = 0,

i = y (=1)

i

,

by which the elds are transformed as

b0 = z20,

bz = z2z,

a = 0.

17

one of the three variables can be gauged away using this residual symmetry and another

one is determined by the constraint equation, so we expect one physical degree of freedom.

by examining the equations (3.12) and (3.13), we rst note that they are rewritten as

where a and b are dened by

znb + 7ao = 0,

0nb + 7ao = 0,

a = gsa,
b = q

(3.29)

(3.30)

(3.31)

(3.32)

(3.33)

we have set the constant c = 0 by invoking the boundary condition (see section 4)

that the action evaluated with the solution have no contribution from the boundary
at the origin (z  ). this condition which we always assume in the present work
essentially amounts to requiring that the self-adjointness of the kinetic operator is not
violated at the core, i.e, inside boundary z  . that is in general the natural boundary
condition at points where the classical solutions are singular. for such an analysis of linear

perturbations around singular classical solutions, we would like to refer the reader to [19].
now for the generic case   2, there are four equations for three variables. first
it is easy to check that the set of the equations are consistent by showing that (3.14) is

derived from (3.12), (3.13) and (3.15). since two of them (3.13) and (3.15) contain time

derivative of second order, we note that there are two physical degrees of freedom. to

obtain the diagonalized excitations, we make a linear combination of the derivatives of

(3.12) and (3.13) which reads

where we have included also the  = 1 mode.

let us next turn to the scalar modes. we shall start by examining the modes with

lowest angular momentum  = 0. there are 7 equations for 7 variables , b0

i, a0
and az. as in the vector case, we have to examine the residual gauge symmetry for the

0, b0

z, bz

z, bi

equations. there are two kinds of residual gauge symmetries. one is the two dimensional

dieomorphism for which the gauge parameter is of the form

0 = 0y (=0),

z = zy (=0),

i = 0,

as in the vector case, 3 variables can be gauged away using this gauge freedom and another

3 variables will be determined by the constraints. we thus expect only one physical degree

of freedom. for  = 0, we note that (3.24) and (3.25) can be rewritten, respectively, as

it is easy to check the consistency of the result by seeing that the set of the solutions

obtained above actually satises the original equations.

we can repeat the similar analysis for  = 1.

in this case, there are 10 equations

for 7 variables. we rst check that 3 of them are consequences of the other equations:
for   1, (3.17) + (3.19) + (3.25)  (3.21), (3.17) + (3.18) + (3.19) + (3.16) + (3.24) 
(3.22), (3.24) + (3.25)  (3.26). there is a residual gauge symmetry associated with the

20

conformal killing vector on s8, ( the so-called conformal dieomorphism [18]). it is the

dieomorphism whose parameters take the form

z = zy (=1),

(3.46)

we nd two physical degrees of freedom for  = 1 mode. since the nal result, however,

is more conveniently summarized by using the dynamical modes for generic , let us now
turn to the case   2.

first, there are 11 equations for 7 variables. we can check that 4 of them are conse-

quences of the other equations. in addition to the relations mentioned in the  = 1 case
above, we have (3.21) + (3.22) + (3.20)  (3.23) for  6= 1. only 3 of the remaining 7
equations are the equations of motion. the combinations of the 3 dynamical components

which diagonalize the equations of motion are given as

(3.48)

it can be checked that s3 is a gauge mode for  = 1. that is, we can proceed in the same
way as   2 case if we impose (3.23) using the residual gauge symmetry of the  = 1
mode. however, there still remains a gauge symmetry which enables us to gauge away

s3. also, note that the result agrees with the analysis for  = 0. in this case, we impose

(3.21), (3.22), (3.26) and (3.23) using the residual gauge symmetries. from the constraint

21

(3.41) and the gauge condition (3.23), we can see that s2 and s3 vanish for  = 0. the

3.2 the uctuations of ns-ns 2 form and rr 3-form elds

respectively. the natural gauge conditions for performing the harmonic analysis are

di b0i = di bzi = di bij = 0
di a0zi = di a0ij = di azij = di aijk = 0

(3.53)

which make us possible to expand as

b0z = 0zy,
a0zi = 0zyi,

b0i = 0yi,
a0ij = 0y[ij],

bzi = zyi,

bij = y[ij]

azij = zy[ij],

aijk = y[ijk]

(3.54)

where yi, y[ij] and y[ijk] are called 1-form, 2-form and 3-form harmonics respectively

whose denitions and properties are summarized in appendix. for notational brevity, we

abbreviated the sum over .

22

we rst comment on the counting of the degrees of freedom. the number of the elds
are originally 45 ( b) + 120 ( a). there are 9 ( b) + 36 ( a) constraints coming
from the eld equations, and the gauge conditions (3.53) eliminate 9+36 components.

thus we have 75 physical components. in terms of the expansion by spherical harmonics,
we will see that for the generic case (  1) there is no radial degree of freedom for the
scalar, one for 1-form, two for divergenceless 2-form and one for divergenceless 3-form,

which indeed sum up to 75 degrees of freedom.

as in the previous subsection, let us start from the case of lowest angular momentum.

from the denition, there is no  = 0 contribution for p-form harmonics with nonzero p.
therefore, only possibility for  = 0 mode is the s8 scalar component 0z. however, it is
easy to see that the scalar component 0z can be gauged away using the residual gauge
symmetry for b with parameter

0 = 0y (=0), z = zy (=0) i = 0.

which leads to

0z = 0z  z0.
thus there is no  = 0 mode in the physical spectrum.

now, we shall analyse the generic   1 case. the equations listed in the rest of this

section are valid for   1. the component equations for the scalar harmonics are

which are solved trivially by

consequences of (3.62). using the similar arguments as in the previous subsection, this

shows that there is only one physical degree of freedom. the radial equation is obtained

4. supergravity-matrix theory correspondence

we now try to establish the correspondence between 10 dimensional supergravity and

matrix theory in the large n limit using the results of the harmonic analysis. we will

follow the specic prescription in euclidean metric given in [2] by assuming that the

the near horizon condition, namely, at z = q

boundary on the side of supergravity is located at the limit of the region of validity for
7 (r  q1/7). remember, as emphasized
in section 2, that this is compulsory because we are interested in the region gsn > 1.

since the perturbing elds are diagonalized, we can discuss each diagonalized components

separately.

first we consider the traceless-symmetric tensor mode as a simple example and then

present the general result. the relevant part of the action is

(4.7)

where gi denotes each diagonalized eld and cij comes from the normalization of each
kind of the spherical harmonics. the diagonalized elds gi are redened by making

suitable scalings by powers of z such that they obey the bessel equations without any
pre-factor of z. we also note that, in terms of gi the boundary condition at the inside
boundary, r = 0 or z  , corresponding to the self-adjointness of the kinetic operator
which enables us to extract the correlators from the near-horizon boundary, is zgizgi

d1-brane has been given in a recent paper [23] for a certain particular mode of metric uctuations.

we note that, up to a total derivative term, the above linearlized action (4.8) is

equivalent to the s-wave part of the following special (euclidean) action for a massive

is an interesting question whether the above mass can be related to the casimir operator

in the representation of the generalized conformal symmetry.

we are now ready to discuss the correspondence of the spectrum of supergravity to

the matrix-theory operators. various currents (more precisely x-integrated currents)

of matrix theory have been identied in the work [20] from the results of perturbative

calculations for the interactions between pairs of general background congurations of

matrix theory. let us quote their results below using their convention. we will only

present the parts of the denitions to the extent that are needed in order to read o their

generalized conformal dimensions. these operators have denite dimensions under the

generalized conformal transformations. note that the generalized conformal dimensions

are not identical to the engineering dimensions. for full expressions of these operators, we

refer the reader to [20]. anticipating the correspondence with 11 dimensional supergravity,

we will use their notations using the 11 dimensional light-cone indices. corresponding to

11 dimensional metric, we have

we have omitted the 6-form current since the supergravity uctuations do not contain

it directly. the convention is that the indices i, j, . . . run over 9 spatial dimensions, and

the indices a, b, . . . do over the 10 dimensions (=time + 9 spatial dimensions). the eld
strength fab thus consists of 2 part, f0i = xi and fij = [xi, xj]/2
s. to avoid possible
confusion, we remark that the light-cone indices on these operators must be interpreted as

being for the current densities before integration. there is implicitly a hidden integration

over x which is not manifest in matrix theory. the generalized conformal dimensions of

these operators are given in tables 3 and 4.

also that the trace part of the noncontracted indices should be subtracted, corresponding

1 and 2 are either pure gauge modes or not independent physical propagating modes in

the bulk.

the agreement of the generalized conformal dimensions between the uctuations of

supergravity and the matrix-theory operators is not surprising if we consider it from 11

dimensional viewpoint of discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq). the reason is (see the

second paper in ref. [6]) that the scaling transformations (2.6) and (2.7) are equivalent, as

was already mentioned in section 2, to the following boost-like transformation (minkowski

metric)

t  2t, r  2r. xi  xi.

to (4.16) except for the identication of the time variable, provided that we interpret the
compactication radius r to be along the x direction x  x + 2r. . although the
reduction to 10 dimensions in general breaks the boost invariance by setting the dilaton

to be of the form (2.10), the symmetry is recovered in the near-horizon limit. in fact, it is

easy to check that taking the near horizon limit in 10 dimensions is equivalent to modify

the 11 dimensional metric (4.17) to

ds2

11 = 2dtdx +

q
r7 dxdx + dxidxi,

which is indeed invariant under (4.16). remember that the 10d and 11d metrics are
10 + e4 /3(dx10  a0dt)2. thus we expect that the uctuations
related by ds2
around the d-particle solution in the near horizon limit is classied by the transformation

11 = e2 3ds2

property corresponding to the boost if we reinterpret the time as the light-cone time
t  x+ which is understandable in the limit of small compactication radius r along
the x direction. the dimensions indicated in the tables 3 and 4 agree precisely with

32

those expected from the boost transformation after making the shift corresponding to

the change of unit: the resulting dimensions are uniformly shifted by one unit from the
generalized conformal dimensions and are given by the formula 2(nn+)+2+4/7. the
additional factor 2 corresponds to the hidden integration over x. thus the agreement

of the dimensions on both sides is just as it should be. this provides strong evidence for

the consistency of matrix theory with the dlcq interpretation for large n, conforming

to the results of perturbative calculations [15] [16] at xed n.

however, in general, the knowledge of the dimensions is not sucient to x the form of

the correlators even for 2-and 3-point functions, in contrast to the case of usual conformal

symmetry. once the dependence on the coupling gs is given, we would be able to x

the scaling behavior with respect to the time dierences. namely, the coupling constant

dependence and the scaling behavior with respect to time are only simultaneously deter-

mined. we should recall here that in the usual conformal case, the coupling constant is

invariant under the conformal transformation, so that we cannot x the coupling con-

stant dependence of the correlators by conformal symmetry. we again need an explicit

computation to determine it. thus the strength of the constraint that the generalized

conformal transformation puts on green functions is not less than the one we had in the

case of the ordinary conformal symmetry. for example, even though the wilson loop in
the case of ads5s5 exhibits the coulomb behavior, ads-cft correspondence predicts
[24] a very nontrivial behavior (g2

eective (charge)2, suggesting the existence of a screening eect of factor 1/gsn due to
complicated large n dynamics. in a similar sense, our result (4.9) for the correlators gives

ymn)1/2, instead of g2

nontrivial predictions for the 2-point correlators of matrix theory in the large n limit.

we remark that in the particular problem treated in the present paper, it is actually

possible to predict the gs (and n) dependence of two point correlators from the generalized

conformal dimension  as

where e = 1 is the engineering dimension of the operator, using the fact that, apart
from the newton constant 2, gs only appears in the combination q  gsn7

from a purely 10 dimensional viewpoint, we can consider the non-extremal black hole

the correlator (4.6) for the traceless symmetric tensor part of the metric perturbation

gives precisely the same n and gs dependencies in the part which is independent of .

the agreement may be regarded as evidence for the fact that the correlator corresponding

to the energy-momentum tensor without mixing of other modes adequately counts the

number of degrees of freedom in the low-energy regime of many d-particle dynamics.

let us nally turn to the crucial problem, namely, the possible implications of our

results on the matrix theory conjecture as originally proposed in [12]. as summarized

in section 2, the basic assumption behind this conjecture is that the innite-momentum

frame (imf) is achieved by taking the large n limit with the compactication radius along

the 11th spatial direction being kept xed. if the conjecture is valid, the large n behavior

must also be consistent with the dierent identication of the boost transformation in

sending the system to imf. namely, the boost factor is proportional to n,

  n, p  

1
n

p , p +  np +,

. . . .

(4.20)

note that now r, p and the transverse coordinates xi are all xed. this scaling is

indeed consistent with the form of the hamiltonian (2.4) as already reviewed in section

2. this limit is, however, entirely dierent from the usual t hooft limit in which we keep
gsn  g2
ymn xed and then (4.9) would be proportional to n 2 as it should be. in the
limit (4.20), on the other hand, the 2-point functions behave quite dierently as

ho( )o( )i  n  12

7 g(   ).

(4.21)

we parametrize the order  of bessel function as

 =

7
5

(1  n+ + n) +

2
5

,

34

where n is the number of light-cone indices  of the corresponding matrix operators.
using this result, we can dene the eective boost dimensions of the operators by

dim f =

6
5

(n+  n  1)  (

1
5

+

1
7

).

the factor 1/7 in the last parenthesis is canceled by the normalization factor in the
harmonic expansion, while the factor 1 in the rst parenthesis should correspond to the
hidden integration over x. it is now possible to assign the dimensions n 6/5 = n 1n 1/5
to the upper light-cone indices  respectively, and n 1/5 to each orbital factor xi along
s8 in the harmonic expansion. namely, the dimension dim f is determined solely by

the external space-time indices of the operator. this itself is a nontrivial phenomenon,

suggesting that the large n limit is indeed connected with some space-time symmetry of

matrix theory. it implies the validity of a large n renormalization group equation of the

following type


n

n

xi=1(cid:16)i



i  dim f,i(cid:17)iho1(1)o2(2)   on(n)ic = 0

for general n-point correlation functions of matrix theory before making the scaling trans-

formation (4.20).

however, the usual kinematics would require that the scaling factor associated to the
light-cone indices be n 1 instead of n 6/5. how to interpret the anomalous factor n 1/5
is not clear to us. is it correlated with the same power factor n 1/5 associated to the
orbital factor along s8? in view of holography [12], on the other hand, the latter behavior
n 1/5  0 is quite puzzling at least apparently, since the transverse size of the system
should increase as the number of partons increases. it is not completely obvious to us,

however, whether this implies an immediate contradiction with holography.

it might

indicate some kind of screening eect in the large n limit with respect to the eective

sizes of the states for higher angular momentum as seen from physical operators. this

is somewhat reminiscent of the behavior of the wilson loop in the case of ads5-sym

correspondence as mentioned above. remember that the increase of transverse size under

the boost usually associated with holography is itself a very puzzling behavior and certain

screening must be operative for its resolution.

35

let us examine the range of validity of the above predictions on the large n imf.

we have emphasized in section 2 that the range of validity of the generalized ads-cft
correspondence for matrix theory is limited by an infrared cuto of order (gsn)1/7s in

the large n limit for gsn > 1.
in the large n limit with a small but xed gs, this
cuto is bigger than the transverse extension proportional to n 1/9 of the typical states
derived in mean eld approximation [12] (or n 11/81 in the thomas-fermi approximation

[26]) in eectivce theory for diagonal components, but is smaller than the more reliable
estimate n 1/3 obtained by use of the virial theorem [22], which explicitly takes account

into the uctuations of o-diagonal components. therefore, it seems that the limitation

in the infrared region is rather serious. this strongly suggests that our results should

be regarded as predictions for the correlators of matrix theory put in a small box from

the point of view of the matrix-theory conjecture. the anomalous scaling behavior may

then be interpreted as an artifact caused by the nite size eect. the latter eect may

contribute to the lessening of the degrees of freedom.

on the other hand, in the short distance limit for the validity of the generalized ads-
s n 1/7s < r, in the 10 dimensional picture.
cft correspondence was (2.19) , r10  g1/3
for a small but xed gs as required by the large n imf, the lower limit increases in

the same order as the near-horizon limit. this certainly makes dubious our procedure

in extracting the correlators from the near horizon boundary. formally, however, the

contribution at the inside boundary still vanishes exponentially in the large n limit for

xed but suciently small gs. remember that we have normalized the solutions at the
outer near-horizon boundary. it is also possible to take the limit such that both gsn  
and vanishing of the ratio of two distances, r10/q1/7  0, are valid simultaneously in the
limit of large n by allowing that gs slowly changes with large n. this suggests that our

result may be continued to the region of the large n imf at least in the short distance

region. furthermore, we can improve the situation by going to the 11 dimensional picture.

in the latter, the short distance condition for the validity of the classical approximation
is (2.20), r11  g5/27
s n 2/63  0 (or z11/q1/7 =
n 5/63  ) for n   for xed gs, our procedure of extracting the correlators
g20/189
s
from the near-horizon boundary in this picture is safer than in the 10 dimensional picture.

s n 1/9s < r. since r11/q1/7 = g8/189

do the limitations which we have discussed here explain the above anomalous behav-

36

ior? or is it related to a dierent limitation that we are considering the small coupling
region r  p ? note that from the viewpoint of 11 dimensions the parameter r only
appears as an overall scale factor of the hamiltonian (2.3). this seems to indicate that
the scaling property is not aected by the condition r  p . in any case, it is necessary
to clarify these problems before drawing denite conclusions on the matrix theory con-

jecture from our predictions on the correlation functions. we hope that our predictions

will be useful for future investigations.

appendix

spherical harmonics on sn

any function dened on sn can be expanded into the set of the irreducible representa-

tions of so(n +1), namely the spherical harmonics. we briey summarize the denitions

and the properties of the spherical harmonics. details on the spherical harmonics in gen-

eral dimensions can be found e.g. in [27].

a scalar function (r, xi), where r is the radius of the sphere sn and xi (i = 1, ..., n +

1; xixi = 1) are normalized cartesian coordinates on the sphere, can be expanded as

y is called the scalar harmonics whose explicit form is given by

 = x (r)y (xi).

(a.1)

y = cm1...mxm1    xm
37

( = 0, 1, . . .)

(a.2)

where cm1...m is totally symmetric and traceless in its indices. in what follows we set
n = 8. we have suppressed the indices which label the harmonics here and in the

text for the sake of brevity. note that harmonics with a given  transform irreducibly

under so(9) and the number of independent harmonics is given by the dimension of the

representation. spherical harmonics are the eigenfunctions of the laplacian on the sphere

(which corresponds to the second order casimir of so(9)). the eigenvalue evaluated on
the unit sphere s8 is

a vector function ai on the sphere can be written as a sum of the divergenceless part

didiy = ( + 7)y.

(a.3)

and the derivative of a scalar

ai = x a(r)yi(xi) +x a(r)diy (xi).

(a.4)

divergenceless vector yi is called the vector harmonics. the explicit form is given by

yn = cnm1...mxm1    xm

( = 1, 2 . . .).

(a.5)

the indices of cnm1...m is antisymmetric under the exchange of the rst two (n, m1),
totally symmetric and traceless with respect to m1, . . . , m. the rst condition is to
ensure that the vector is tangent to the sphere. we need   1 to satisfy the conditions.
the eigenvalue of the laplacian is

djdjyi = [( + 7) + 1]yi

if we impose the condition di ai = 0, the expansion must be

ai = x ayi.

(a.6)

(a.7)

which is easily veried using (a.3) and diy (=0) = 0.

symmetric traceless tensor on s8 is written as the sum of divergenceless part, derivative

of a divergenceless vector and second derivative of a scalar.

k = x b(r)yij(xi) +x b(r)(diyj + djyi)(xi) +x b(r)(didj  gijdkdk)y (xi)

(a.8)

38

the explicit form of the tensor harmonics yij is given by

yn1n2 = cn1n2m1...mxm1    xm

( = 2, 3 . . .).

(a.9)

the indices of cn1n2m1...m must be antisymmetric under the exchange of (n1, m1) or
(n2, m2) to ensure that the tensor indices are tangent to the sphere, symmetric under the

exchange of (n1, n2) to make the tensor indices symmetric, and totally symmetric and
traceless with respect to m1 . . . m. we need   2 to meet the conditions. the eigenvalue
of the laplacian is

dkdkyij = [( + 7) + 2]yij.

(a.10)

if we impose the condition di(hij  gijhk
reduced to

k) = 0, it can be proved that the expansion is

hij  gijhk

k = x byij.

(a.11)

similarly, p-form ai1...ip (p = 1, 2, 3) can be written as the sum of the divergenceless

part and the exterior derivative of (p  1)-form

ai1...ip(xi) = x y[i1...ip](xi) +x d[i1y[i2...ip]](xi)

(a.12)

the explicit form of the p-form harmonics y[i1...ip] is

y[n1...np] = cn1...npm1...mxm1    xm

( = 1, 2 . . .).

(a.13)

the indices of cn1...npm1...m is antisymmetric under the interchange of m1 with any one
of n1, . . . , n and totally symmetric and traceless with respect to(m1 . . . m). to meet the
conditions, we need   1. under the condition di1 ai1...ip = 0, the expansion becomes

the eigenvalue of the laplacian is

ai1...ip = x y[i1...ip]

dkdky[i1...ip] = [( + 7) + p]y[i1...ip].
