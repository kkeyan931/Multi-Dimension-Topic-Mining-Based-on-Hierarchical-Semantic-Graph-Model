we trace the origin of -terms in non-linear -models as a nonperturbative anomaly of current
algebras. the non-linear -models emerge as a low energy limit of fermionic -models. the latter
describe dirac fermions coupled to chiral bosonic elds. we discuss the geometric phases in three
hierarchies of fermionic -models in spacetime dimension (d + 1) with chiral bosonic elds taking
values on d-, d + 1-, and d + 2-dimensional spheres. the geometric phases in the rst two hierarchies
are -terms. we emphasize a relation between -terms and quantum numbers of solitons.

i. introduction

non-linear -models describe the low energy dynamics of goldstone bosons emerging as a result of a symmetry
breaking. one particularly important source of this phenomenon is a chiral symmetry breaking due to an interaction
between dirac fermions and a chiral bosonic eld. this interaction is described by models of current algebras, fermionic
-models. examples are considered below (1-3,7-9).

in case of chiral symmetry breaking, the non-linear -models are determined not only by the pattern of symmetry
breaking, but also by global characteristics of a congurational space of chiral elds.
in most interesting cases
congurational space is not simply connected. there are spacetime congurations of a chiral eld which can not be
continuously deformed one into another. an adiabatic motion along a noncontractible closed path in a congurational
space leads to a geometric phase acquired by the wave function. in the action of a non-linear -model, the geometric
phase emerges as a -term. it is a topological invariant of a mapping of a spacetime manifold m into a target space
g of a chiral eld. although a -term does not appear in equations of motions, its dramatic impact on dynamics of
goldstone bosons is needless to emphasize.

the -terms reect the anomalous character of the chiral current algebra. some aspects of chiral anomalies can be
studied perturbatively. for instance, a fermionic current, induced by a soliton can be obtained in a regular gradient
expansion1. the -terms are more involved. they defy a perturbative analysis and are often referred to as a global
(nonperturbative) anomaly.

the -terms appear in dierent physical situations. a particularly interesting one is when a noncontractible
spacetime conguration is a world trajectory of a soliton carrying a fermionic number. in this case a -term is linked
to quantum numbers of solitons. it is assumed that all d spatial dimensions are compactied to a sphere m = sd
and the homotopy group (m, g) = d (g) 6= 0 is not zero. then solitons correspond to the homotopy classes of
the mapping sd  g. interaction with fermions induces a fermionic number localized on a soliton. this internal
quantum number of a soliton converts into rotational quantum numbers: spin, statistics and isospin. intuitively it is
appealing that a fermionic number and spin or statistics of a soliton are two faces of the same phenomenon. if, for
instance, a soliton acquires a unit fermionic number, one expects it to become a spin 1/2 fermion. in spite of this,
the fermionic number and spin or statistics of a soliton appear dierently in the a non-linear -model. the fermionic
number is assigned by the term n aj, where a is an abelian gauge eld, j is a topological current of a soliton,
and n is a number of avors of a current algebra1. in its turn the spin and statistics are described by a -term. if
the homotopy group (m ; g) is nonzero, one can consider an adiabatic 2-rotation of a soliton around a given axis
as an example of a noncontractible spacetime conguration. the -term of the non-linear -model represents in this
case the geometric phase obtained in this process.

in this paper we intend to clarify some aspects of nonperturbative anomalies of current algebras and -terms in
non-linear -models. we consider two hierarchies of fermionic -models in spatial dimensions d = 0, 1, 2, 3,    which
generate -terms. the target space of the rst hierarchy is a d-dimensional sphere sd. it admits solitons d (g) =
d (sd) = z. the target space of the second hierarchy is sd+1. there are no solitons in this case d (sd+1) = 0.

most of non-linear -models we discuss have important physical applications, some of which will be described
elsewhere2. we show how -terms emerge as nonperturbative anomalies of fermionic -models and how they can be

1

obtained from perturbative anomalies. in particular, we show that a non-linear -model of current algebra which
supports solitons and has noncontractible spacetime pathes always contains a -term with a xed value of  = n .

in the next three sections we summarize the results of the paper. we write the fermionic models for two hierarchies
in sec.ii, and list the corresponding non-linear -models obtained via gradient expansion in sec.iii. the generalization
for arbitrary dimensions is discussed in sec.iv. we sketch the computations of anomalous terms for the rst and
second hierarchies in secs.v-vi. the sec.vii is a summary.

a. the rst hierarchy of fermionic -models in spatial dimensions d = 1, 2, 3 is

l2 = (cid:0)i d + im~n~(cid:1),
l3 = (cid:0)i d + im(0 + i5~~ )(cid:1),

here and thereon we use euclidian formulation and assume a mass to be positive m > 0. a dirac fermion  has a
avor running from 1 to n and d = (  ia). in dimensions (2+1) and (3+1) the fermion is also an su (2)
doublet and ~ are pauli matrices acting in isospace. fermions interact with chiral elds which take values on spheres
sd (target space). hereafter we reserve a dierent (historically motivated) notations for 2-, 3-, and 4-dimensional unit
vectors. in one spatial dimension the chiral eld is a phase 1 + i2 = ei. in d = 2 the chiral eld is a 3-dimensional
unit vector ~n = (n1, n2, n3), ~n2 = 1. correspondingly the chiral eld in three spatial dimensions is a 4-dimensional
unit vector (~, 0). it can also be considered as an element of su (2) ( s3) group g = 0 + i~~ .

physical applications of fernionic models (1-3) on spheres are known. in d = 1 it is familiar peierls-frohlich model
of polyacetylene3. the model in d = 3 appears in the past as a model for nuclear forces4 and recently has been used
in the qcd context5. all these models also emerged in the context of topological superuids2.

in every model of this hierarchy a compactied coordinate space sd matches the target space of chiral elds, also sd.
therefore, every model supports solitons with an arbitrary (integer) topological charge q. the topological charge q

labels homotopy classes d (sd) = z and can be written as a spatial integral q =r ddx j0 of a zeroth component of

a topological current j. in dimensions d = 1, 2, 3 topological currents are:

on smooth congurations of chiral elds topological currents are identically conserved j = 0. we discuss two
dierent types of spacetime boundary conditions: a compactication of the spacetime to a sphere sd+1, and more
physical one  a compactication of the space to a sphere sd at every moment of time and periodic (anti-periodic)
boundary conditions in euclidian time. in other words, m = sd  s1. in the latter case a congurational space is
divided into disconnected topological sectors characterized by total number of solitons q.

in every model of the rst hierarchy there are processes which wrap a spacetime m = sd  s1 over a target space
sd. we consider simple examples of such processes. in d = 1 it is a translation of a soliton around the spatial ring; in
d > 1 it is e.g., a 2-rotation of a soliton around a chosen axis. these spacetime congurations belong to a nontrivial
homotopy classes of (m ; g). these classes can be labeled by an integer hd (in addition to q), which for our simple
processes appears to be equal to the topological charge of the soliton hd = q.

if the spacetime is compactied into a sphere sd+1, a conguration with a given number of solitons at any time
does not exist. noncontractible spacetime congurations are more complicated. they consist, e.g., of the creation
of a soliton-antisoliton pair, rotation of a soliton around its axis, and subsequent annihilation of the pair6. this
process belongs to a nontrivial homotopy class of d+1 (sd). the corresponding homotopy groups are 2 (s1) = 0,
3 (s2) = z, and d+1 (sd) = z2 for d > 2.

b. next we consider the second hierarchy of fermionic -models with the target space sd+1. it starts from the

model in d = 0 (quantum mechanics):

here  is some constant, i and 5 are 4  4 dirac matrices: {i, j} = 2ij,
5 = 1234. fermions in
d = 0, 1 are 2-component isospinors of so(3) and in d = 2 are 4-component isospinors of so(4). the chiral elds
do not have solitons d (sd+1) = 0, but do have noncontractible spacetime congurations according to the homotopy
classes d+1(sd+1) = z.

iii. non-linear -models

an action for a chiral eld which appears as a result of an integration over fermions is a non-linear -model

wd =  lnr exp (r dxld)dd . the non-linear -models can be systematically studied in 1/m (gradient)

expansion. then anomalies are given by dimensionless terms of the action of a non-linear -model. they give the
only contribution to the imaginary part of euclidian action.

below we list the leading terms of non-linear -models for the fermionic models of the sec.ii. they are the main

result of the paper. we start from the rst hierarchy (1-3).

a. in (1+1):

w1 = n ln det(cid:0)i d + imei5(cid:1)

= inz d2xaj + in h1 + nz d2x

()2.

(10)

hereafter we omit higher order terms in 1/m.

the geometric phase n h1 is a -term with  = n . if the spacetime is compactied to a sphere s2, the geometric
phase vanishes unless  is singular (spacetime vortices). for the spacetime compactied into a torus t 2 = s1  s1,
we have (t 2, s1) = z  z. there are two integer numbers to characterize spacetime congurations. one of them
2 . the geometric phase in

this case is nontrivial even for non-singular congurations. it is a product of 1-cycles over space and time:

is a topological charge q =h dx x

2 while the other is a temporal winding number h dt t

in (2+1):

h1[] = qi dt

w2 = n ln det(cid:0)i d + im~n~(cid:1)

= inz d3xaj + in h2[~n] + n

m

8 z d3x (~n)2.

(11)

(12)

here n h2 is a -term with  = n . the integer h2 is a homotopy class of a map of the spacetime to the target
space s2. in the case when the spacetime is compactied to a sphere s3, h2 is the hopf number. it can be any
integer 3 (s2) = z. a geometric interpretation of the hopf number is well known (see e.g., refs.6,7). it is a linking
number of world lines of two dierent values ~n1 and ~n2 of ~n-eld. the hopf number can be explicitly written in terms
of su (2) matrix u (x) which rotates the vector ~n to the chosen (third) axis: ~n~ = u 13u . then the hopf number
is a degree of mapping of (2+1) spacetime into su (2):

h2[~n] =



242 z d3x tr(u 1u ) (u 1 u ) (u 1u ).

(13)

if the spacetime is compactied into m = s2  s1, the topology of the mapping m  s2 is more complicated. the
homotopy classes are labeled by two integers (q, h2). the rst is a topological charge of solitons. it is the same at
all times. the second integer h2 is a topological invariant of spacetime congurations. h2 is generalizing the hopf
invariant, dened for a map s3  s2.

in general, the homotopy classes of maps s2  s1  s2 do not form a group. however, they do form a group in
a sector with a xed topological charge. in a sector with zero topological charge and if the vector ~n(x = , t) on
the space innity does not depend on time, h2 is the hopf invariant. it is a linking number of world trajectories of

3

two arbitrarily chosen points ~n1 and ~n2 of the target space. however, in a sector with non-zero topological charge
some links can be unlinked with the help of a continuous deformation of the vector at space innity. to construct
a proper topological invariant one has to consider the angle of rotation of ~n (x = , t) around one of the vectors ~n1
or ~n2 as it is illustrated in ref.8. the new invariant, however, is intrinsically ambiguous and is dened modulo 2q
only. there is a deep mathematical theorem, which says that in a sector with topological charge q there are only
9. in a sector with q solitons a 2k rotation
2q homotopy classes, and that they form a nite abelian group z2q
of a single soliton with k = 0,    , 2q  1 is a representative spacetime conguration of the k-th homotopy class. if
(t) is an angle of rotation of a soliton of charge q around xed axis, the invariant h2 is given by the same formula
(11) as in (1+1) case. it is a product of the spatial 2-cycle q and the temporal 1-cycle. a more detailed discussion
is planned elsewhere2.

finally in (3+1):

w3 = n ln det(cid:0)i d + img5(cid:1)

in general, the nite number of homotopy classes gives a restriction for admissible values of . the wave function or
eiw forms a single-valued representation of the homotopy group only if  is a multiple of 2/l, where l is a dimension
of the homotopy group. in (3 + 1) and higher dimensional models of this hierarchy d+1 (sd) = z2. this limits the
value of  to multiples of .

this restriction is of a particular interest in (2+1) case. in a sector with q solitons the allowed values of  are
multiples of /q. even in the case when the spacetime is compactied to a sphere, where there is no formal restriction
on a value of  6, solitons and antisolitons can not be treated as true particles, unless  is quantized in units of /q.
if one does not want to restrict a -model to a sector with a given number of solitons, the only allowed values of 
are multiples of  (see also ref.10).

the anomalous part aj in (10,12,14) with j from (4-6) has been computed in ref.3,12,1 for d = 1, 2, 3 re-
spectively. the geometric phase in (1+1) on a spacetime compactied into a torus (11) appeared in a context of
bosonization on general riemann surfaces (see ref.13). the geometric phase of (12) has been considered in ref.14.
the geometric phase in (3+1) is related to the so-called su (2) anomaly and can be found in ref.15. o(3) non-linear
-model at  = /2 has been obtained from (1+1) fermionic model (8) in ref.16.

below we also mention one more (third) hierarchy, with the target space sd+2. these models do not have solitons
d (sd+2) = 0, and they do not have -terms either: d+1(sd+2) = 0. their geometric phases are perturbative
wess-zumino terms due to d+2 (sd+2) = z.

iv. -models in higher dimensions

v. -term and quantum numbers of soliton

we start from the rst hierarchy (1-3). it is well known that a soliton in these models acquires a fermionic charge
due to a chiral anomaly. it is described by the rst term in non-linear -models (10,12,14). varying over the gauge
eld, we obtain a fermionic current induced by a soliton

j = i



a

wd = n j.

(30)

this result means that a hamiltonian of a fermionic model taken in a static soliton background have an additional n q
levels with negative energy e < 0 compared to the one in a topologically at background. computations of the induced
current are perturbative and known1,14,18. we write l = d and j = i 
a
expanding the denominator in gradients of chiral elds

n tr ln d = in tr(cid:8)(dd)1d(cid:9).

j = mn tr(

1

2 + m2 (cid:18)m v (d+1)

1

2 + m2(cid:19)d

(v (d+1))) ,

(31)

and calculating the trace, we obtain the result (30) with topological current (22). for dimensions d = 1, 2, 3 this gives
(4-6). this is the rst nonvanishing term in the gradient expansion for current. one can use (31) only for large size
( 1/m) solitons. if the soliton is small, the gradient expansion is not applicable: some levels cross e = 0 and soliton
becomes uncharged19.

the leading regular term of eective actions (10,12,14) can be obtained in a similar fashion by varying over a chiral

eld:

wd = n trnimv (d+1)(dd)1do

= n m2tr(cid:26)v (d+1)

2 + m2

v (d+1)

(cid:27) .

the calculation of the -term is more complicated due to its nonperturbative nature. below we employ the method
suggested in ref.14. we illustrate it on the example of (2+1) theory (2) and choose the spacetime to be compactied
into s2  s1. we specify ~n(~x, t)~ = e i
to be a charge q soliton slowly rotating around third axis
given by ~n0(~x = ) and performing total 2-angle rotation (t )  (0) = 2 in time t . then we compare the value
of the determinant of the dirac operator det (i  + im~n (~x, t)~ ) with the one for a static, nonrotating soliton ~n0(~x).
according to the sec.iii, we expect that a dierence between topological terms h2 for these two congurations is q.
then the ratio of the determinants is eiq which gives the value of the coecient  in front of -term. other (regular)
terms are negligible as soon rotation is adiabatically slow.

to facilitate computation it is tempting to make a gauge transformation   e i

. then the transformed
dirac operator i d + 1
2 0  3 + im~n0~ depends on time derivative of  and is ready for a gradient expansion. this
approach, however, misses the geometric phase. the resolution of this puzzle is typical for an anomalous calculus.
the gauge transformation we performed is anomalous. it is not single-valued: a change of  by 2 changes the sign
of  if q is odd. this transformation changes the antiperiodic boundary condition (0) = (t ) to the periodic
one (0) = e
improved by making an additional abelian gauge transformation   e
2 0 +im~n0~ .
now boundary conditions for  are the same as for  and we can expand the transformed dirac operator in . at
this point we notice that 1
2  enters dirac operator the same way as constant in space gauge potential a0. then the
variation of an eective action over  can be computed the same way as it has been done for the calculation of an
induced current. the result is expressed in terms of the induced charge. we have

2h dt(t ) = (1)q+1(t ) by creating a ux  through the temporal loop. the situation may be

(33)

this gives us the topological term h2 in (12) with  = n .

a computation of the geometric phase for a conguration other than a rotating soliton is technically involved. it
is not necessary though due to a topological nature of the geometric phase. it is a topological invariant and does not
change within a homotopy class. we may, therefore consider a particular conguration2 rotation of a soliton of
charge q to nd a -angle, a coecient in front of the topological invariant. generalization of these arguments to
higher dimensions is straightforward.

these arguments clearly relate the fermionic number of a soliton with its angular momentum (33) and, therefore,
its statistics. if solitons are charged they also have nonzero angular momentum (and corresponding statistics). the
latter translates into the -term in a non-linear -model. the value of  in this term is determined by the charge of
soliton. since the fermionic charge in our models is an integer the value of  is always a multiple of . contrary the
-terms in the second hierarchy can get any value.

despite dierent dimensions of models belonging to the rst hierarchy, statistical properties of solitons do not

depend on a dimension of the spacetime. here is a brief list of them.

(i) a soliton with a topological charge q carries a fermionic number n q.
(ii) a soliton of unit topological charge in a model with odd (even) number of avors n has a half-integer (integer)
spin. to see this in spatial dimensions 2 and 3 in a spacetime compactied into a sphere, one might consider an
adiabatic process when soliton-antisoliton pair is created, the soliton is rotated by 2-angle, and then the pair is
annihilated. this process corresponds to a spacetime conguration from nontrivial homotopy class. the value of
-term in the action for this spacetime conguration is n  and the wave function of the entire system changes its
sign under 2-rotation. we conclude that this soliton has a spin n/2. we notice that although the -term vanishes
modulo 2 at even n its eect does not disappear. a soliton in this case has an integer spin20,6,21 equal to n/2.

(iii) a process when two solitons interchange their spatial positions also changes the topological invariant by one6
and the geometric phase by n . this leads to a conclusion that a soliton is a fermion (boson) in case n is odd (even).
(iv) in the toroidal space geometry (spatial dimensions are compactied into a torus) the -term changes momentum

(v) the -term can be also interpreted locally as a berry phase22 of an adiabatically rotating soliton. the total

phase acquired by the vacuum state as a result of 2-rotation is the -term.

vi. wess-zumino and -terms

noncontractible spacetime congurations of the second hierarchy (7-9,23) are not linked to any particle-like states.
the analysis of -terms in this case is simpler. they may be obtained through a reduction from the wess-zumino
perturbative anomaly15. the construction is following. let us increase the target space sd+1 of the models (7-9,23)
to sd+2. then all spacetime congurations become contractible d+1 (sd+2) = 0. it does not mean, however, that a
geometric phase vanishes. it exists due to a nonzero homotopy group d+2(sd+2) = z (see ref.20). in this case the
geometric phase is perturbative and is known as wess-zumino term. under the reduction back to sd+1, the wess-
zumino term converts into a nonperturbative -term. to carry out this procedure, we consider the third hierarchy of
fermionic models with the target space sd+2. they are the same as (23) but with no constraint (24) (a constant 
becomes a dynamic eld):

where we adopt the notation v (d+3) = v .

in dimensions d = 0, 1 these are familiar models:

d = i d + imv,

(0 + 1) :

(1 + 1) :

d = id + im~n~ ,
d = i d + im(0 + i5~~ ).

we shall compute the perturbative anomaly for the third hierarchy (34) and then enforce the condition (24).

(p2+m2)d+2 and trace is taken over both lorentzian and isospace gamma-matrices. integration is
performed over the spacetime sd+1. the method to restore the action of non-linear -model is standard20. introduce a
parameter  such that ~v (x, ) continuously interpolates between constant ~v (x,  = 0) = (~0, vd+3) and given spacetime
conguration ~v (x,  = 1) = ~v (x). the eld ~v (x, ) is therefore dened on a disk b, which boundary b = sd+1 is
the spacetime of our model. take a jacobian of a map of d + 2-sphere (x, ) to d + 2-sphere ~v (x, ) and integrate it
over the disk:

(38)

since the integrand is a full derivative the result of the integration, depends only on the physical eld dened on the
boundary of the disk. its variation gives (37). adding a leading term of the gradient expansion of the real part of
n tr ln d we obtain the non-linear -models for the third hierarchy (34):

now let us perform a reduction of the target space (d + 2)-sphere of the wess-zumino models to sd+1 by imposing
constraint (24). it brings us back to the models of interest (15-17,27-29). the condition (24) embeds a (d + 1)-sphere
into a (d + 2)-sphere as a latitude  section. under this condition, ~v on the boundary of the disk (x,  = 1) (physical
spacetime) takes values on sd+1. in this case the wess-zumino term is equal to a degree of a mapping sd+1  sd+1
times the fraction of the volume of sd+2 cut o by the latitude corresponding to the angle . this factor is the value
of  in the models (15-17,27-29). it is given by (29). in particular at  = /2 the value of the -angle is n .

vii. summary

to summarize the results of the paper: we discussed connections between global properties of chiral current algebras
and geometric phases in non-linear -models. to understand these connections the mappings of three dierent
manifolds to the manifold (target space) of the chiral eld are essential. these manifolds are: (i) space, (ii) spacetime,
and (iii) a disk which boundary is a spacetime.

we considered three hierarchies of models of dirac fermions in (d + 1)-dimension coupled with chiral boson eld.
the chiral elds take values on d-, d + 1-, and d + 2-dimensional spheres respectively. each hierarchy provides a
dierent physical origin of a geometric phase. most of the models in dimensions d = 1, 2, 3 have important physical
applications.

the current algebras with a d-dimensional sphere as a target space (rst hierarchy) support solitonsnontrivial
homotopy classes of spatial congurations of the chiral eld. solitons carry an integer fermionic charge. we showed
(see also ref.14) that the induced actions for the chiral eld (non-linear -models) necessarily possess -terms. these
terms represent homotopy classes of d+ 1-dimensional spacetime congurations. the value of -angle is tightly related
to the charge of solitons. it is equal to  times the fermionic number of the soliton with a unit topological charge.
the -term is a geometric phase reecting a spin and statistics of the soliton. the spin appears to be equal a half of
the fermionic number, thus establishing a relation between a fermionic number and spin (statistics) of a soliton.

the current algebra with sd+1 target space (the second hierarchy) does not have solitons. all spatial congurations
are contractible. however, spacetime congurations are not. as a result there is a -term in the non-linear -model.

8

contrary to the rst hierarchy, a -angle is not restricted and may take any value, depending on the value of the
parameter in the fermionic model. we obtained it as a result of a reduction from current algebras on d + 2-spheres.
finally for the current algebras on d + 2-dimensional spheres (the third hierarchy) both spatial and spacetime
congurations are contractible. as a result, there is no -term in the non-linear -model. however, the geometric
phase exists due to nontrivial extensions of spacetime congurations to a d + 2-dimensional sphere. this geometric
phase is the wz-term with a coecient equal to the number of avors of fermions. the non-linear -models in this
case can be obtained by a regular gradient expansion.
