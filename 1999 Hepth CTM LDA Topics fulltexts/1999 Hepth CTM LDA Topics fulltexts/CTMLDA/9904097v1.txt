abstract: we construct the energy momentum tensor for the bosonic elds of the
covariant formulation of the m-theory vebrane within that formalism. we then
obtain the energy for various solitonic solutions of the vebrane equations of motion.

1

introduction

there exist two basic extended solitonic objects in eleven dimensional m-theory, a membrane and
a vebrane. the membranes dynamics are described by eight scalar elds and their spinorial
superpartners and can be derived from the usual super-p-brane action [1]. on the other hand the
dynamics of the vebrane are much more complicated since they include a self-dual three form
tensor eld. the equations of motion for this system have only been obtained relatively recently
an provide us with an interesting physical system which has received substantial attention.

there are essentially two formalisms for the dynamics of the m-vebrane. the rst is based
on the manifestly covariant superembedding formalism [2, 3] which we will study here. there is a
second approach based on the non-covariant description of [4, 5]. this latter approach was then
later expanded into a covariant form [6] by the introduction of an auxiliary scalar. in this case the
equations of motion can be obtained from an action and hence many physical quantities such as
the energy density can be readily obtained. however, there are serious objections to the use of an
action for the m-vebrane [7, 8] due to subtleties associated with the self-duality constraint.

we are therefore interested here in extending the covariant superembedding approach which
does not invoke the use of an action. to date a draw back has been that various physical quantities
such as the energy have not been identied within this formalism. thus in this paper we aim to
derive directly from the covariant equations of motion the full non-linear energy momentum tensor
for bosonic elds of the m-theory vebrane.

in addition the covariant equations of motion can lead to lengthy calculations and one expects
that a knowledge of the energy, and more generally the energy momentum tensor, will oer physical
insights into the structure of this highly nonlinear theory. this should also be helpful when nding
and studying new solutions. finally, since in the action framework the energy is known it might
also lead to a better understanding of the relation between the two approaches.

this paper is organised as follows: we start by giving a brief introduction into the covariant
formulation of the m-vebrane. we then construct a two parameter family of all symmetric second
rank tensors which are covariantly conserved when the elds obey their equations of motion. after
xing the free parameters using the six dimensional supersymmetry we are naturally led to a unique
form for the energy momentum tensor. as expected the resulting energy density is positive denite.
following this we will evaluate the tensor for a number of solitonic solutions to the m-vebrane
equations of motion which involve the self-dual three form [9, 10]. we reproduce the results for
the energy in all cases where it was previously obtained using the hamiltonian formalism and also
obtain it for one additional case; two intersecting self-dual strings.

2 the m-theory fivebrane

let us consider an m-vebrane in the x0, x1, x2, ..., x5 plane. the eld content consists of ve scalars
x a
, a = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and a 16 component spinor  corresponding to the breaking of translation
and half the spacetime supersymmetry respectively. however it also contains an antisymmetric
second rank tensor gauge eld b whose eld strength obeys a self-duality condition.

the classical equations of motion of the vebrane in the absence of fermions and background

elds are [3]

and

gmnmnx a

= 0,

gmnmhnpq = 0.

(1)

(2)

we use m, n, p, . . . = 0, 1, . . . , 5 and a, b, c, . . . = 0, 1, . . . , 5 for world and tangent indices respec-
tively. the symbols that occur in the equations of motion are dened as follows: the usual induced
metric for a p-brane is given, in static gauge and at background superspace, by

gmn  mn + mx a

nx b

ab .

(3)

the covariant derivative in the equations of motion is dened using the levi-civita connection
associated with the metric gmn.

we dene the world surface sechsbein associated with the above metric in the usual way via
aaben
b  gmn. there is another inverse metric gmn which occurs in the equations of motion,
em
mediating the coupling between the scalars and the gauge eld and the self-coupling of the latter.
it is related to the usual induced metric given above by the equation

gmn  (e1)c

mcam d

a m b

d (e1)b

where the matrix m is given by

m b

the eld habc is a three-form which is self-dual

(6)

with 012345 = 1 and ab = diag(1, +1, . . . , +1), but it is not the curl of a three-form gauge eld.
it is related to the eld hmnp  3[mbnp] which appears in the equations of motion and is the curl
of the two-form gauge eld bnp, but hmnp is not self-dual in the linear sense. the relationship
between the two elds is given by

hmnp = e a

(7)

clearly, the self-duality of habd transforms into a condition for hmnp and vice versa for the bianchi
identity dh = 0.

3 constructing the tensor

3.1 the three-form case

with all scalar elds set to zero the vebrane dynamics reduce to the a system involving a self-
interacting three-form in 6-dimensional at minkowski-spacetime. for convenience we shall work
in the tangent frame in this section. in this case the self-dual three-form tensor eld habc equation
of motion becomes [11]

where we write mab as

dening a new matrix kab by

mabahbcd = 0,

mab = ab  2kab,

kab  ha

cdhbcd.

we shall need some consequences of the self-duality of habc, namely

and

where

ka

a = 0,

kabkbc =

1
6

a

ck2,

k2  kabkab.

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

we now want to nd the energy momentum tensor associated with this system. to be precise we
want to construct a second rank symmetric tensor tab obeying the conservation equation

atab = 0.

(14)

observe that the equation of motion (8) has a symmetry, we can send habc to habc and the equation
remains unchanged. demanding that the energy momentum tensor respects this symmetry implies
that habc can appear only quadratically i.e. in the form of k2 or kab.

the most general ansatz compatible with this restriction is

tab = f1(k2)ab + f2(k2)kab,

(15)

where f1 and f2 are two arbitrary functions. from (8) we can obtain an equation of motion for
kab, namely

mabakbc = akac  2kabakbc = 0.

we can iterate this equation as follows

akab = 2kacakcb,

= 2a(kackcb)  2kcbakac,
= 1

c,

3 bk2  4kcbkadakd
3 bk2 + 4kcbkd

3 k2akab.

3 kabak2,

(16)

(17)

c,

rewriting the last line gives

akab =

1

3 mabak2
3 k2 .
1  2

plugging this into our ansatz we get

atab = bf1(k2) + kabaf2(k2) + f2(k2)akab,

= f1bk2 + kabf2ak2 + f2

= (cid:18)f1 + f2

(18)

(19)

demanding conservation implies that the expressions in the two brackets should vanish. this gives
two ordinary dierential equations for f1 and f2. the general solutions are

f2 =

,

and

f1 =

3  2k2 + ,

(20)

with two constants  and . hence the most general conserved symmetric tensor built out of kab
has the form

kab = ab

(21)

3.2 the covariant generalisation

there is an obvious generalisation of this tensor to the case of active scalars, namely by interpreting
the at-space coordinates of the previous section as coordinates of the tangent-frame. however it
is not obvious that this doesnt spoil our earlier reasoning. the setup remains the same apart from
the equation of motion (8) which becomes [3]

mabahbcd = 0.

(22)

the main dierence between working in at space and working in the moving frame is the fact
that the covariant derivatives do not commute. but since all our calculations only involve a single
derivative everything goes through as before and we nd that

is covariantly conserved

tab = ab 

1
2



3  2k2

mab,

atab = 0.

(23)

(24)

we can now nd the canonical tensor simply by switching to the coordinate frame using the

sechsbeins. we will furthermore include a conventional factor of g into our tensor to make sure

that

etot = z d5xt 00,

(25)

is the invariant total energy. this allows us to interpret the vebrane-model alternatively as

a nonlinear theory in six-dimensional at space where d6x rather than gd6x is the natural

measure.

rescaling  for later convenience we get

where we introduced q  1  2

t mn = ggmn + gq1mmn,
3 k2.

(26)

3.3 fixing the parameters

the alert reader might be surprised about the appearance of two free parameters in the conserved
tensor. this is however to be expected since the energy contains two arbitrary parameters, namely
the scale and the origin. indeed the second constant  multiplies the metric gmn which is always
covariantly constant and therefore by our construction  is entirely arbitrary.

on the other hand in a supersymmetric theory there is an alternative way of computing energy
and momentum; they appear on the right hand side of the anti-commutator of two supersymmetry
transformations. this relation will allow us to x one of the parameters.

the most general form of the (2,0) supersymmetry algebra in six dimensions is

, qj

{qi

} = ij m

pm + m

z ij

m + mnp

 z ij

mnp,

(27)

where ij is the spin(5) invariant tensor, pm is the momentum and z ij
mnp are central
charges. the spinor indices , , . . . run from 1 to 4 as do the internal spin(5) indices i, j, . . . . the
-matrices should not be confused with ordinary -matrices satisfying {m, n} = 2mn. they
arise as building blocks of the eleven dimensional -matrices via

m and z ij

m =(cid:18) 0 m

m 0 (cid:19) .

the basic relations are

{m, n}  mn + nm = 2mn,

with m = m for m 6= 0 and 0 = 0 = 1. the antisymmetric product is dened as

and one also has the following duality relation

m1m2m3...  [m1 m2m3 . . . ,

m1m2...mn = 

1

(6  n)!

n(n+1)

2

(1)

m1m2...mnmn+1...m6mn+1...m6.

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

we need the local version of equation (27). recall that to every symmetry of a physical system
one can construct an associated conserved current j which upon integration gives rise to a time
independent charge

q =z dd1xj0,

which acts as a generator of the symmetry on the elds of the model via

 = [q, ].

(32)

(33)

the expression on the right hand side of the last equation is understood to be evaluated in terms
of the poisson brackets of the fundamental elds.

hence the local version of equation (27) is given by

z d5x{qi

, jj

0} =z d5xij m

t0m + central charge terms,

where jj

m is the supercurrent and tmn the energy momentum tensor. we can rewrite this as

z d5xi

jj

0 =z d5xij m

t0m + central charge terms,

(34)

(35)

from which we learn that the energy momentum tensor can be obtained as the supervariation of
the supercurrent.

to make our calculation simpler we shall consider the linearised supersymmetry and also ignore
all interactions. this will allow us to use the free-eld poisson brackets and yet will still determine
the constant .

since we are only interested in the bosonic part of the energy we can focus on the part of the

supercurrent which is of the form

j = b + terms cubic in ,

(36)

where b is constructed out of bosonic elds only. the full supervariation of the supercurrent is
then given by

j = b,

(37)

plus terms which vanish if we set the fermions to zero. to determine b consider the supervariation
of , the dirac conjugate of . we have

  = {q, } =z d5x{j, } =z d5x{b, } =z d5xb{, } = b,

(38)

where we used the free fermion poisson bracket {(x), (x)} = (x x) and ignored terms which
vanish if we set the fermions to zero. hence can read o all information from the supervariation of
the fermions, which was calculated for the most general case in [10]. we have, at linearised level,

for simplicity we take only one of the scalars elds to be active, namely x  x 5

and

and neglecting the last term which is a central charge contribution we nd

j =

m0pxpx  mx0x  4km0(cid:27) .

expanding (26) up to terms quadratic in elds gives

t mn = ( + )(mn + 1

2 mnpxpx  mxnx)  2kmn.

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

the two expressions look similar except for the rst term in (44) which does not appear in (43).
this is to be expected, however, since a conguration with all elds set to zero corresponds to the
vacuum and hence must have zero energy in a supersymmetric theory. from the 11-dimensional

viewpoint the same conguration is a at, static brane which has the constant energy density
normalised to one.

comparing the other coecients gives the relation  =  1

2  and we nd that

t mn =  1
2

g
q ((2  q)gmn  4kmn) ,

(45)

is the unique conserved, symmetric rank two tensor that is compatible with supersymmetry, jus-
tifying the name energy momentum tensor. following our earlier reasoning we can normalise the
tensor by demanding that it reduces to mn if all elds are set to zero. this gives  = 2, a choice
we adopt from now on. for a static conguration we nd the following simple formula for the
energy density

e =

g
q (cid:0)2  q + 4k00(cid:1) .

(46)

recall that the eld hmnp is not closed and the physics is most naturally described by hmnp. we
would therefore like to nd t mn in terms of hmnp. to this end we note two identities which can
be readily derived [10]

q = 

3

h 2  1 r1 +

2
3

h 2! ,

hmnp = qh (+)

mnp,

where h (+)

mnp is the self-dual part of hmnp. therefore one nds

kmn = q2h (+)mpqh (+)n

pq.

(47)

(48)

(49)

finally we note that we can rewrite this tensor in a much simpler form in terms of the natural
metric gmn occurring in the superembedding formalism. to this end recall the denition of the
inverse metric (4),

gmn = (1 + 2

3 k2)gmn  4kmn = (2  q)gmn  4kmn.

using this we nd that

t mn = gq1gmn.

we can replace the determinant as well. using


g = q3g

we nd a third expression for the tensor, namely

t mn = 

gq2gmn.

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

from this nal expression it is obvious that the energy, given by e = t 00, is always positive
denite. note that g and q2 are always positive and g00 is the time-time-component of the
metric which occurs naturally in the embedding formalism. using our conventions this implies that
g00 is negative denite and hence the energy is positive denite. we note that this agrees with
the energy momentum tensor obtained using the action formulation [12].

4 applications

to make contact with previous work on the energy of vebrane congurations we now evaluate
our tensor for some of the known solitonic solutions to the vebrane equations of motion. for
most cases expressions for the energy are also known [13, 10] from the noncovariant hamiltonian
formalism [4, 5, 6]. here we are able to reproduce these known results and also to determine the
energy for the intersecting self-dual string solution of [10, 14].

4.1 the self-dual string

we are looking for a string-soliton whose world sheet lies in the (x0, x5)-plane and hence take all
elds to be independent of these two coordinates. we shall denote indices ranging from 0 to 5 from
indices ranging from 1 to 4 by putting a hat on the former. we use the following ansatz [9]

x 6
 ,
h05a  va,
habc = abcdvd,

(54)

the last equation being a consequence of the self-duality of h. all other scalars and all other
components of habc are set to zero. to evaluate the energy-momentum tensor we have to calculate
the m-matrix. in the tangent frame we get:

ma

b =


1 + 4v2

which agrees with the result obtained using the non-covariant formalism [13, 10].

4.2 neutral strings: the instanton

this solution is obtained by setting all scalars to zero, and taking the remaining elds to be
independent of the x0 and x5 directions. since with all scalars inactive the induced metric is the
at metric we shall work in the tangent frame in this section. furthermore we take the three-form
to be

with all other components set to zero. depending on the sign the two-form fab is taken to be
either self-dual or anti-self-dual. we get the following expression for ka

b,

h0ab = h5ab  fab,

ka

b =

where f 2 = f abfab and the scalar k2 vanishes. focusing on the energy we have

e = t 00 = 1 + 4f 2.

(65)

this also agrees, up to a rescaling of f  1
formalism [10].

using the bogomolnyi condition (61) gives after a lengthy calculation the following expression for
the energy

e = 1 + ||2 + (1 +p1 + ||2)2f 2.

this result uses the unphysical eld fab which is not the curl of a one-form gauge eld. recall that
in general the self-dual three-form habc is not equal to the physical three-form habc. the relation
between fab and the physical eld kab = h0ab is given by

hence in terms of k the energy is given by

kab = (1  4v2)1fab = 1

2 (1 +p1 + ||2)fab.

e = 1 + ||2 + 4k 2,

which up to a rescaling k  1
hamiltonian formalism [10].

4 k agrees with the expression for the energy obtained using the

4.4 intersecting self-dual strings: the monopole

as a nal example we now consider two intersecting self-dual strings [10, 14]. this soliton can
be related to monopole congurations in n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theories [14] and the
evaluation of the energy is therefore of some interest.

we have two active scalars, x 6

, depending on the 4 spacetime coordinates x0, . . . , x3
and two additional coordinates x4 and x5. it will be useful to introduce complex coordinates for
these

and x 7

z  x4 + ix5,

(70)

and also to combine the two real scalar elds into a single complex scalar eld

we denote the associated derivatives by

s  x 6

+ ix 7

.

  4 + i5.

(71)

(72)

in this section we use indices a, b, c, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3 in the tangent-frame, where we will perform
all calculations, indices m, n, p, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3 in the world-frame and put hats on these to denote
indices taking the full range from 0 to 5. in the tangent frame we shall also use i, j, k, . . . = 1, 2, 3
to denote purely spatial indices.

in the complex coordinate system the at metric and its inverse are given by

where ab and ab denote the usual four-dimensional at minkowski-metric and its inverse. in the
world-frame we nd

g mn =  mn + 1

2 ns ms + 1

2 ns ms.

we also need the determinant which is given by

g =  det g = (1 + |s|2  | s|2)2 + 4| s|2

(74)

(75)

we will only consider static solutions, i.e. have set 0  0 and also have expanded all expressions
up to second order in the spatial derivatives for simplicity. the process of solving the vebrane
equations starts with making an ansatz for the six-dimensional three-form. we decompose h into
four-dimensional two-forms and vectors as follows

self-duality of h implies that habc = 2abcdvd and fab = i
conditions [10, 14]. given in the tangent frame they are

q = 1  256v2

despite the complexity of the bogomolnyi conditions we nally get a remarkably simple answer
for the energy, namely

e =

g

1 + |s|2  | s|2

,

where the determinant of the spacetime metric is given by (75).

if we take s to be a holomorphic function of z the energy reduces to

e = 1 + |s|2 + |is|2.
reverting to the real scalar elds and setting   0 we nd

e = 1 + (ix 6)2 + (ix 7)2,

which agrees with the energy obtained using the hamiltonian formalism as given in [10].

where q =  3
3 h 2) and h (+) denotes the selfdual part of h, is covariantly conserved,
compatible with supersymmetry and gives expressions for the energy of solitonic congurations
which agree with the hamiltonian expressions in all known cases.

in closing we remark that although the change of variables between the covariant and action
approaches is rather complicated [12] our results and those of [10] suggest that, for bps states, we
may simply identify

h pst

mn = 1

where vp is the unit vector in the action formulation [6]. perhaps this observation will lead to a
better understanding of the relation between the two approaches.
