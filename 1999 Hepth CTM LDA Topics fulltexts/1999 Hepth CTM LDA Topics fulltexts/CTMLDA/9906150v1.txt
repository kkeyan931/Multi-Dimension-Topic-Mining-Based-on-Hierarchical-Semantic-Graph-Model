abstract. to formulate two-dimensional yangmills theory with adjoint matter elds
in the large-n limit as classical mechanics, we derive a poisson algebra for the color-
invariant observables involving adjoint matter elds. we showed rigorously in ref.
[15] that dierent quantum orderings of the observables produce essentially the same
poisson algebra. here we explain, in a less precise but more pedagogical manner, the
crucial topological graphical observations underlying the formal proof.

one major unsolved problem in physics is hadronic structure. we would like to
explain, for instance, the momentum distributions of valence quarks, sea quarks and
gluons inside a proton. we have accumulated a fairly large amount of experimental
data on the distribution functions [1], but we have made relatively little advance in
explaining them from the widely accepted fundamental theory of strong interaction,
quantum chromodynamics (qcd).

the emergence of hadrons is a low-energy phenomenon of strong interaction. the
strong coupling constant is large, and perturbative qcd fails very badly. other
approximations are needed. one widely studied approximation is the large-n limit,
in which the number of colors n is taken to be innitely large [2]. this approxima-
tion is believed to capture the essence of low-energy strong interaction phenomena.
indeed, t hooft showed that if spacetime is assumed to be two-dimensional only,
then the meson spectrum displays itself as a regge trajectory [3]. this attrac-
tive feature of the large-n limit has drawn the attention of a large number of
researchers for more than two decades. they want to build up a systematic theory
of the large-n limit to deal with baryons in addition to mesons in four-dimensional
spacetime.

one important feature of the large-n limit is that the expectation value of a
product of two observables a and b is the same as the product of the expectation
values of these two observables. the dierence is of order 1/n and so can be

1) speaker.

omitted [4,5]:

h a bi = h aih bi + o(1/n).

in other words, there is no quantum uctuation. the theory thus behaves like
classical mechanics [6], and it should be possible for us to formulate the large-n
limit of qcd as classical mechanics.

formally speaking, we need three ingredients to build up a theory as classical
mechanics [7]. the rst is the notion of a manifold to describe the geometry of the
phase space of positions and momenta. dynamical variables are then functions on
the manifold. the second is the notion of a hamiltonian function h, one of the
dynamical variables. this function displays the physical features (e.g., symmetry)
of the system, and governs the time evolution of it. how the hamiltonian function
governs the time evolution is determined by a poisson algebra [8], the third ingre-
dient of classical mechanics. to understand what a poisson algebra is, we need a
number of preliminary notions.

an algebra r is a linear space on a eld k with a multiplication rule of any 2

vectors in r such that for any x, y and z  r and a  k,

1. xy  r;

2. the vectors satisfy the distributive properties

x(y + z) = xy + xz and
(x + y)z = xz + yz; and

3. a(xy) = (ax)y = x(ay).

an associative algebra is an algebra r such that for any x, y and z  r,

x(yz) = (xy)z.

a poisson algebra is an associative algebra r which is equipped with a blinear map
{ , } : r  r  r, the poisson bracket, with the following properties for any x, y
and z  r:

1. skew-symmetry:

2. the jacobi identity:

{y, x} = {x, y};

{x, {y, z}} + {y, {z, x}} + {z, {x, y}} = 0; and

3. the leibniz identity:

{xy, z} = x{y, z} + {x, z}y.

how a dynamical variable g(t) changes with the time t is given by the equation

dg(t)

dt

= {g.h}.

making the assumption that spacetime is two-dimensional, one of us introduced
a formulation of large-n yangmills theory as classical mechanics several years ago
[9]. as in the mesonic model t hooft studied, gluons are not dynamical objects
in this classcial mechanics; only quarks and anti-quarks are. the phase space
turns out to an innite-dimensional grassmannian manifold [10]. (briey speaking,
an innite-dimensional grassmannian manifold is a collection of subspaces of an
innite-dimensional vector space. a dierential structure is conferred upon this
collection to turn it into a manifold.) dynamical variables are composed of quark
and anti-quark elds. they are bilocal functions on the grassmannian manifold.
the poisson bracket can be uniquely determined from the geometric properties of
the grassmanian. the hamiltonian is chosen in such a way that upon quantization
of this classical mechanics, i.e., if we retain terms of subleading orders in the large-n
limit, it will take exactly the form the action of yangmills theory is conventionally
written. the meson spectrum predicted by this classical mechanics is precisely the
same as that obtained by t hooft. however, the model can be used to calculate
structure functions of a baryon also [11]. as an initial attempt, the proton is
assumed to be made up of valence quarks only. sea quarks and gluons are omitted.
in the innite momentum frame, the transverse momenta of valence quarks can
be neglected. thus the yangmills theory can be dimensionally reduced from four
dimensions to two. dimensional reduction is a good approximation for valence
quarks carrying a large fraction of the total momentum of the proton, but not
so good for the quarks carrying almost no momentum. indeed, it turned out the
momentum distribution functions predicted by this classical model of yangmills
theory agrees well with experimental data at high-momentum regime, but not so
well near zero momentum.

how about sea quarks and gluons inside a hadron? the sea quark distribution
function can actually be predicted within the same classical mechanical framework
[9,12]; it is a matter of modifying the details of some approximations. however,
gluon dynamics require a new set poisson brackets and a new phase space. since
gluons carry about 20% of the total momentum of a proton [1], it is worthwhile to
study them further.

a poisson algebra for gluons was constructed a few years ago [13]. this was
achieved by a technique called deformation quantization [14,8]. deformation quan-
tization refers to the procedure of dening an algebra of smooth functions in such
a way that when the functions are multiplied, it is as if we are multiplying suitably
ordered operators these smooth functions represent. any physical observable of
gluons must involve creation and annihilation operators of gluons, each of which
carries two color quantum numbers and a vector-valued linear momentum. the
two color quantum numbers can be treated as the row and column indices of an
n  n matrix, n being the total number of colors. any physical observable has

to be color-invariant. this implies that it has to be a polynomial of the traces of
matrix products with a generic form

f i =

1

n m/2+1 tri1i2    im,

where i1, i2, . . . , im are quantum states other than colors of the gluons, i is the
sequence i1, i2, . . . im, and the factor of n is put to the left of the trace to ensure
that the poisson algebra of these f is, to be introduced shortly, is well dened in
the large-n limit. in each product, the operators have to satisfy a certain ordering.
as an initial attempt, the operators are weyl-ordered in ref. [13]. hence,

i = 1/2(ai
i = i/2(ai

 + ai
 )
  ai
 )

when we multiply two physical observables together, we need to rearrange the order
of the creation and annihilation operators to make the resultant product consistent
with the quantum ordering. as a result, multiplication of physical observables
is still associative but no longer commutative. the commutator of two physical
observables therefore provides us a poisson bracket. in the case of weyl-ordered
quantum observables of gluons, the poisson bracket is

{f i, f j}w = 2i

in this equation, ij is an anti-symmetric constant tensor. i(1, 2)j(2, 1) is the
sequence i1+1, i1+2, . . . , i21, j2+1, j2+2, . . . , j11. notice that we sum over all
possible sets of values of 1, 2, . . . , r such that they are strictly increasing, and
all possible sets of values of 1, 2, . . . , r such that they are strictly decreasing up
to a cyclic permutation. eq.(1) looks complicated, but we can actually visualize it
in fig. 1. we will call this poisson algebra w.

nevertheless, in many practical applications, we need quantum observables made
up of normal-ordered rather than weyl-ordered operators. we thus need to apply
the above idea of deformation quantization to derive a poisson bracket of normal-
ordered observables [15]. in this case, a color-invariant observable has the form

i =

f i(3,4)j(1,5), f i(4,5)j(2,1), and f i(5,1)j(3,2). we can identify these color-invariant ob-
servables by their vertices. for example, f i(1,2)j(4,3) can be described as a loop with vertices
i1 , i2 , j4 and j3 , though none of these vertices belong to f i(1,2)j(4,3).

the poisson algebras w and n look very dierent. are they intrinsically dierent
poisson algebras, or are they the same poisson algebra with dierent expressions?
this question can be answered by looking for a poisson morphism between w and
n . let r1 and r2 be two poisson algebras. a poisson morphism is a mapping
f : r1  r2 such that it preserves

1. vector addition:

2. scalar multiplication:

3. vector multiplication:

f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y);

f (kx) = kf (x);

f (xy) = f (x)f (y); and

4. the poisson bracket:

f ({x, y}1) = {f (x), f (y)}2

for any k  k, x and y  r1. here { , }1 and { , }2 are the poisson brackets of
r1 and r2, respectively. if there exists a poisson morphism between two poisson
algebras, then they are eectively the same poisson algebra.

in our case, a poisson morphism f : w  n does exist. the reader can nd a
thoroughly rigorous formulation and proof of this poisson morphism in ref. [15].
roughly speaking, the mapping f is accomplished in two steps. consider the color-
invariant observable f i1...i22  w in fig. 2. the rst step involves splitting the big
all-encompassing loop into a number of smaller loops. the straight lines joining
the solid circles and cutting o the big loop have to be within the loop. moreover,
no two straight lines can cross each other. each solid circle i which is not touched
by any straight line is now identied as a linear combination of solid circles i in
n by the formula

i = ( 1

2 (zi + zi)
2 (zi  zi)

i

if i > 0; and
if i < 0.

the resultant diagram represents the product of the color-invariant observables in
n , each of which is represented by a smaller loop in the resultant diagram. for
instance, the product in fig. 2(a) is

t i4i22t i7i21t i8i17t i10i16t i12i14i1i2i3i5i6i9i11i15i13i18i19i20,

where t ij is a polynomial of c ij and c ji, where in turn c ij is a polynomial of ij,

figure 3. a typical term in {f (f i), f (f j )}n or f ({f i, f j }w ).

i,j, i,j and i,j [15]. the second step involves summing over all allowable
partitions of f i in w.

why is this f a poisson morphism? the most non-trivial statement we need to
show is that f preserves the poisson bracket. in other words, we need to show that
each term in {f (f i), f (f j)}n is a term in f ({f i, f j}w ), and vice versa. consider
fig. 3. the big oval-shaped object on the left is f i, and the one on the right is f j.
the dotted lines inside f i divide it into a product of color-invariant observables
in n . so do the dotted lines insider f j . a typical term in {f (f i), f (f j)}n is
obtained by choosing a smaller loop in i, and a smaller loop in j, and perform
the contractions illustrated in fig. 1. in fig. 3, we have chosen the smaller loop
with vertices i11(1), i11(1) , i20(1) , i20(1) , i30(1) and i30(1) in i, and the smaller
loop j21(1) , j21(1) , j30(1) , j30(1) , j30(3) , j30(3) , j30(4) and j30(4) in j. (see the
explanation of the jargons here in the caption of fig. 1.) there are 7 contractions
due to the poisson bracket. the contracted pairs are i10 and j10, i11 and j11,
i20 and j20, i21 and j21, i22 and j22, i23 and j23, and i30 and j30. according
to eq.(1), these contractions produce in this term of {f (f i), f (f j)}n a constant
factor g which the reader can divine is a polynomial of c i10 ,j10 , . . . , c i30 ,j30 .
now notice a crucial observation. identify ij with a certain polynomial of c ij and
c ji. replace an odd number of c ijs in g with ijs, and the remaining c ijs with
t ijs. add up all such possible replacements. the sum will precisely be g up to a

multiplicative constant. consequently, we can draw some of these contractions as
dotted lines because they are t s, and others as thick lines to show that they are s.
in fig. 3, c i10 j10 , c i20 j20 and c i30 j30 are replaced with i10 j10 , i20 j20 and
i30 j30 , respectively, whereas c i11 j11 , c i21 j21 , c i22 j22 and c i23 j23 are replaced
with t i11 j11 , t i21 j21 , t i22 j22 and t i23 j23 , respectively.

now notice another crucial observation. this diagram can be reproduced by
computing the poisson bracket in w rst and mapping the resultant expression
with f later. the poisson bracket in w produces a product of three color-invariant
observables. the rst one l1 is characterized with the vertices i10, i20, j20 and
j10; the second one l2 with the vertices i20, i30, j30 and j20; and the third one
l3 with the vertices i30, i10, j10 and j30. the mapping f projects this product to
n . this is done, as usual, by splitting these 3 loops into smaller loops with dotted
lines so that no two lines cross each other inside any of these 3 loops. notice that
in fig. 3, if we ip the dotted line i11(1) i11(1) to within l1, and the dotted lines
i20(1) i20(1) and j21(1) j21(1) to within l2, no two dotted lines will cross each other.
therefore, we obtain the same term.

conversely, any term f ({f i, f j}w ) can be seen as a term in {f (f i), f (f j)}n

by a simiar diagrammatic argument. thus f is indeed a poisson morphism.

this poisson algebra may have other interesting mathematical properties. we

hope that we can use this poisson algebra to solve gluon dynamics in the future.
