abstract

an exact expression for the green function of a purely fermionic system

moving on the manifold   d1 where d1 is a (d  1)-torus is found.

this expression involves the bosonic analog of n = ein corresponding to the

irreducible representation for the n-th class of homotopy but in the fermionic

case for d = 2 and 3, n is a measure of the statistics of the particles. for

higher dimensions (d  4), however n could generate masses as in quantum

eld theories at nite temperatures.

the scattering of fermions by vortices is a problem that has importants applications in

particle physics [1] and in the realistic description of the aharonov-bohm eect [2]. although

this topic have been partially discussed in the literature and new corrections to the ab cross

section have been found [3], as far as we know, there are no studies trying to understand

the connection between these processes and the possibility of to sum over homotopy classes

as in the bosonic case [4].

if we have a multiply connected manifold with one vortex, the propagation amplitude

for a spinless particle is



g[x, x

] = xn

ngn[x, x



],

(1)

where gn[x, x] is the propagation amplitude for a given winding number n and n is an

irreducible representation for the n-th homotopy class. the composition law for the green

function imply that n = ein , where  is a quantum phase that, for instance, for the

aharonov-bohm eect is just the magnetic ux.

having in account this result the question is, what is the analog of (1) for particles with

spin?, what is, if exist, the physical meaning of the quantum phase for fermions? and so

on.

the purpose of the present paper is to give an answer to the above questions and to

extend and sketch possibles applications for more complicated topologies.

in order to expose our work more sistematically our work, let us start noticing that the

dirac propagator can be written as



gd[x, x

] = (cid:28) 1
/ (cid:29),

although in this calculation one is inverting a rst order operator (i/ ) and one would

need one boundary condition, the relation

gd[x, x

),

with (x, x) the propagator for a spinless particle dened as



(x, x

) = z

alert us that the boundary condition

x(1) = x
1 ,

x(2) = x
2 ,

(5)

(6)

also have been used in the calculation of (3). on the other hand, although we will not

describe the calculation for the spinning relativistic particle here, the reader should recall

that (6) is explicitly used (plus a boundary condition for the fermionic variables) obtaining

(3) [5].

keeping in mind the above comment, let us start considering the more simplest fermionic

system, namely, a free massless fermion living on 0 + 1-dimensional space. the topology for

this system is the line, i.e. 1, and (2) becomes



gd[x, x

] = lim

where in (7) an infrared regulator m has been introduced in order to make the operator

equation (7) can be evaluated by means the identity [6]

where the last term in the rhs in (9) have been removed because it does not contributes

in the limit m  0. using k(z)  x for x << 1, one nds after taking the limit

gd[x, x

] =

=

sgn(x  x



),

(10)

and, as a consequence, the propagation amplitude becomes the sign function and the relation

gd[x, x



] = (x, x



),

(11)

is correctly satised.

in the next step will be to complicate a litle bit the problem, thus instead of to consider

1, lets consider the s1 topology. in this case the boundary conditions (6) must be modied

as follow

x(1) = x1,

x(2) = x2 + 2n,

(12)

where n = 0, 1, 2, ... is the winding number around the circle and in equation (10) one

should make the replacement x  x + 2n and (10) becomes

gdn[x, x



] =

1
2

sgn(x  x



+ 2n).

(13)

then, naively, (13) would be the green function associated to 1 when x is compact.

however as n  z, (13) can never be satised and the correct green function is obtained by

summing over n and weighting each contribution with a factor n, i.e. one should replace

(13) by

] = xn
as (14) must satisfy the composition law

gd[x, x



n gdn[x, x

].



then (14) and (15) implies

g[x, x] = z dy g[x, y] g[y, x],

n = ein.

(14)

(15)

(16)

the next question is, where  is dened?. one could dene, e.g.  over the interval

0 <  < 2, however this election is not correct because (14) does not satisfy (11) and, as a

consequence, g[x, x] is not a green function.

4

the correct interval for  is

  <  < ,

and with this denition,



gd[x, x

] =

1
2 xn

einsgn(x  x



+ 2n),

(17)

(18)

one see that (18) together with (17) dene the correct green function for a one-dimensional

fermion moving on s1.

the following question is, what is the physical meaning of ?. making the shiftment

x  x + 2 the green function (18) becomes



gd[x, x

+ 2] =

1
2



xn=

ein sgn[x  x



+ 2(n  1)],

and redening n  1 = m, then one nds



gd[x, x

+ 2] = ei gd[x, x



].

thus, if we recall that (x) = r dxg[x, x](x), then one obtain

(x + 2) = ei(x),

(19)

(20)

(21)

implying that after one turn, the spinor change in a phase factor and  become a measure

of the statistics, however the question is, what statistics?.

this question can be answered as follows; lets consider two non-relativistic free fermions

moving on on s1 described by the following lagrangean

l =

i
2

  +

i
2

 .

as in the bosonic case, one can dene the center of mass and relative coordinates

(22)

(23)

where  and  are the analogous of xcm and x = x2  x1 respectively.

replacing (23) in (22) one nd

l = i  +

  .

i

(24)

however the motion of the center of mass is trivial and, by analogy with the bosonic

case, can be neglected. the relative motion, however, is dynamically non trivial and it

corresponds to the motion of one free fermion on a circle. for this case the green function

is (18) and in (21) the phase factor become a measure of the interchange of two particles.

the above results can be easily generalized to d-dimensions for the n-torus. indeed let

us consider a spacetime with the topology t  d1 where t = 1 is the time and d1 is

(d  1) times s1, then the boundary conditions (6) becomes

x0(1) = x1
1

x0(2) = x0
2,

x1(1) = x1
1,

x1(2) = x1

2 + 2n1,

x2(1) = x2
1,

x2(2) = x2

2 + 2n2,

...

xd1(1) = xd1

1

,

xd1(2) = xd1

2 + 2nd1

where n are the winding numbers.

using (25), the green function for the n-th class of homotopy is

gdn[ x2 , x1] = lim

m0z

where n = (n1, ..., nd1).

the integral in (26) can be computed using (8) and in the massless limit (26) becomes

gdn[x2, x1] =

0x0 + pd1
|x0 + pd1

=1 (x  2n)
d/2 ,
=1 (x  2n)|

that contains (13) as a particular case after to remove x0.

as soon as (27) is given, one can conjecture the total green function

gd[x2, x1] = xn1 xn2

... xnd1

n1n2...nd1 gn1n2...nd1[x2, x1],

(28)

where n1n2...nd1 is the generalized n-th homotopy class factor.

however by a theorem of homotopy theory [7], that essentially corresponds to the gener-

alization of the composition law for the green function, the homotopy factors must satisfy

n1n2...nd1 = n1+n2+...+nd1,

(29)

and, as a consequence, each ni must be an exponential and (28)

gd[x2, x1] = xn1 xn2

... xnd1

ei(n11+n22...+nd1d1) gn1n2...nd1[x2, x1],

(30)

becomes the green function for a massless fermion living on the manifold with topology

1  d1, where d1 is the (d  1)-torus.

roughly speaking the case d = 2 is formally equivalent to (18) because for d = 2 the

spatial manifold mspatial  s1 and (28) becomes the green function for a fermion on a

cylinder. for d = 3, mspatial  t 2 is a torus and the phase factor is also a measure of the

(fractional) statistics as was discussed by einarsson in [8]. for higher dimensions (d  4)

the phases are no related with the statistics and, presumibly it could related with generation

of masses as in quantum eld theory at nite temperature.

one could try also include the more interesting case such as the aharonov-bohm eect

with n aligned solenoids, however although this problem is more complicated because the

group of paths is non abelian, one could extract aproximate information and the problem

considered here could useful, for a discussion about this problem in the bosonic case see [9].

in conclusion, we have generalized (1) for the fermionic case and extended also this result

to the n-torus case for arbitrary dimensions. our result could nd interesting applications in

(2 + 1)-dimensions and, particularly, a detailed study on the fractional statistics on a torus

[8] following these lines could relevant in applications to condensed matter theory. more

details about these applications will be published elsewhere.
