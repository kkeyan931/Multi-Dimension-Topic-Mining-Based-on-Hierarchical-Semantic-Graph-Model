abstract

exploiting the quantum integrability condition we construct an ancestor model as-
sociated with a new underlying quadratic algebra. this ancestor model represents an
exactly integrable quantum lattice inhomogeneous anisotropic model and at its various
realizations and limits can generate a wide range of integrable models. they cover quan-

tum lattice as well as eld models associated with the quantum r-matrix of trigonometric
type or at the undeformed q  1 limit similar models belonging to the rational class. the
classical limit likewise yields the corresponding classical discrete and eld models. thus
along with the generation of known integrable models in a unifying way a new class of

inhomogeneous models including variable mass sine-gordon model, inhomogeneous toda
chain, impure spin chains etc. are constructed.

1 introduction

classical integrable systems in 1 + 1 and 0 + 1 dimensions have been given an unifying picture
through possible reductions of the self-dual yang-mills equation [1]. however, such success
could not be achieved in the quantum case and there is therefore a genuine need for discovering
some scheme, which would generate quantum integrable models (qim) [2] along with their
lax operators and r-matrices in an unifying way.

such a scheme should be general enough to describe the lattice as well as the eld models
and quantum as well as the corresponding classical models. similarly it should also have

freedom to switch over from relativistic to nonrelativistic and from anisotropic to isotropic
models. therefore it is natural to demand such unifying ancestor model to be a quantum
(with quantum parameter h), lattice (with lattice constant ) model containing a relativistic
or anisotropic parameter q along with some possible inhomogeneity parameters {c}. from
such a model therefore we can produce dierent types of models at dierent limits of , h, {c}
and q covering a wide range of integrable models. for example at lattice constant   0 one
would generate relativistic quantum eld models like sine-gordon, liouville model etc. and
with further limit q  0 we should get nonrelativistic eld models like nls model.  6= 0
would yield the corresponding lattice versions and also discrete models like relativistic toda
chain, anisotropic xxz spin chain etc. or at q  1 limit, the nonrelativistic toda or the
isotropic xxx spin chain. h  0 at the same time should recover the corresponding classical
discrete or eld models at appropriate limits. {c} 6= 0 on the other hand yields a new class of
inhomogeneous models.

to seek the unifying structure underlying such a general integrable system, we note that
quantum integrable systems exhibit intimate connections with hopf algebras like lie algebras
and their quantum deformations [4]-[10]. therefore, motivated by these facts and our earlier
experience [11],[12], we construct an ancestor model, which is quantum, discrete, q-deformed
and also inhomogeneous. this model is associated with a new hopf algebra, which however
is not introduced by hand but dictated by the integrability condition, i.e. the yang-baxter
equation itself. therefore whenever the elds of the constructed model satisfy the underlying
algebra, its quantum integrability is guaranteed automatically. the ancestor model itself may
be considered as a novel, inhomogeneous, exactly integrable generalized quantum lattice sine-
gordon model and turns out to be an excellent candidate for generating a wide range of
integrable quantum models with 2  2 lax operators. the associated r-matrix is either the
known trigonometric one or its corresponding rational form.

thus our scheme unies a large class of integrable quantum models by generating them in a
systematic way through reductions of an ancestor model with explicit lax operator realization.
note that the lax operator together with the quantum r-matrix dene an integrable system
completely, giving also all conserved quantities including the hamiltonian of the model. to
stress on the wide varieties of the well known quantum integrable models mentioned above,
we have provided a short list of them along with their representative lax operators in the
appendix. this would be helpful for the ready reference and to follow their derivation from
the single ancestor model in our scheme.

2 the unifying algebra

it is more
the unifying algebra proposed in our scheme is found to be a hopf algebra.
general than the well known quantum lie algebra and in contrast represents a quadratic
algebra (qda), so called because the generators in the dening algebraic relations appear in

the quadratic form. the algebra may be dened by the relations

[s3, s] = s,

[s+, s] = (cid:16)m + sin(2s3) + m cos(2s3)(cid:17)

1

sin 

,

[m,] = 0,

(1)

where m are the central elements. we show that (1) is not merely a modication of the
known uq(su(2)) but is a qda underlying an integrable ancestor model and is a consequence
of the quantum yang baxter equation (qybe)

r(  )l()  l() = (i  l())  (l()  i)r(  ).

(2)

we take the associated 4  4 quantum r()-matrix as the well known solution related to the
sine-gordon model, with its nontrivial elements given by [2]

r11

11 = r22

22 = a(), r12

12 = r21

21 = b(), r12

21 = r21

12 = c,

and expressed through trigonometric functions of spectral parameters as

a() = sin( + ), b() = sin , c = sin .

on the other hand, we choose the lax operator of our ancestor model as

2 sin s

 = ei.

(5)

with ca being central to the algebra (1) through the relation m = 1(c+

1 c2  c1 c+
2 ).
the derivation of algebra (1) follows directly from qybe by inserting in it the explicit forms
of the lax operator (5) and the r-matrix (3) and matching dierent powers of the spectral
parameter . therefore algebra (1) or its various realizations in eect becomes equivalent
to the qybe and guarantees the quantum integrability of the model constructed on it. to
establish that (1) is a hopf algebra we show that the following characteristics known as the
coproduct (x) : a  a  a, antipode s : a  a and the counit  : a  k, along with a
multiplication m : a  a  a and a unit  : k  a hold for algebra (1). all these taken
together denes it as a hopf algebra. for deriving these objects we exploit another inherent
property of the qybe, namely the product of two lax operators lajlaj+1 as well as l1
aj
represent also solutions of qybe indicating its inherent hopf algebra structure. using lax
operator (5) therefore we can derive the coproducts in the explicit form

(s+) = c+

2 eis3
(s3) = i  s3 + s3  i

, (s) = c2 eis3
, (ci ) = ci  ci .

 s + s  c1 eis3

(6)

inserting the coproducts in the algebraic relations (1) one can prove after some easy steps
that the same algebra is also true for its tensor product expressed through (6). the hopf
algebra property is a key for obtaining the same ybe relations again for the global object

i=1 li(): r12(  ) t ()  t () = (i  t () t  i() r12(  ). this in

turn derives for t() = trt () the quantum integrability condition [t(), t()] = 0.

t () = qn

similarly one may derive the antipode or the inverse for the algebra as

s(s) = (c+

1 )1eis3

2 )1, s(s+) = (c2 )1eis3
(c+

s+eis3

(c1 )1,

s(ci ) = (ci )1, s(eis3

) = eis3

,

(eis3) =
which satisfy also the same algebraic relations (1). the counit (ci ) = 1,
1, (s) = 0 on the other hand maps the algebra to some number identities. for multiplication
m one can take the formal denition in the algebra, while the unit  may be dened through
the unital element 1 as ()  1.

we also observe that unlike lie algebras or their deformations, due to the presence of
multiplicative operators m in (1), it represents quantum-deformation of a qda. since these
operators have arbitrary eigenvalues including zeros, they can not be removed by scaling and
therefore generically (1) is dierent from the known quantum algebra. moreover dierent
representations of ms generate new structure constants leading to a rich variety of deformed
lie algebras, which are related to dierent integrable systems. this fact becomes important
for its present application. the appearance of qda in the basic integrable system should be
rather expected, since the qybe with r-matrix having c-number elements is itself a qda.
the notion of qda was introduced rst by sklyanin [13].

3 generation of models

for constructing physical models we have to nd rst representations of (1) in physical vari-
ables like canonical variables u, p with commutation relations [u, p] = i, or bosonic operators
,  commuting as [, ] = 1 or the spin variables s, s3. one such representations may be
given by

s3 = u, s+ = eipg(u), s = g(u)eip.

where the operator function

g(u) = (cid:16) + sin (s  u)(m + sin (u + s + 1) + m cos (u + s + 1))(cid:17)

(8)

containing free parameters  and s. inserting this realization in the ancestor lax operator
(5) one gets a novel exactly integrable quantum model generalizing lattice sg model. it is
evident that only for hermitian g(u) one gets s = (s+). we show below the remarkable fact
that by xing dierent eigenvalues of m in the same form (8) of g(u) and taking dierent
limits of the parameters involved and at the same time choosing various realizations we can
derive a whole range of quantum integrable models including new models. as an added
advantage, the lax operators of the models are obtained automatically from (5), while the
r-matrix is simply inherited. the underlying algebras of the models are also given by the

corresponding representations of the ancestor algebra (1). one of the reasons for the success
of this scheme is the quadratic nature of the algebra (1) with the explicit appearance of
casimir operators m. using this feature it is possible to build a new class of models, that
may be considered as the inhomogeneous versions of the existing integrable models. the idea
of such construction is to take locally dierent representations for the central elements, i.e.
instead of taking their eigenvalues as constants one should consider them to be site (and time)
dependent functions. this simply means that in the expressions for g(uj) in (8), m should
be considered as mj and consequently in lax operator (5) all cs should be lattice indexed
as cjs. thus the values of central elements may vary arbitrarily at dierent lattice points
leading to inhomogeneous lattice models. however since the algebra remains the same they
answer to the same quantum r-matrices. physically such inhomogeneities may be interpreted
as impurities, varying external elds, incommensuration etc.

3.1 models belonging to trigonometric class

before constructing inhomogeneous models we show rst that the known models, which were
discovered earlier in isolation and mainly through quantization of the existing classical models,
can be reproduced in a unied way from our single ancestor model.the equations corresponding
to such models along with the explicit forms of their lax operators are listed in the appendix
for comparison. for the eigenvalues of the casimir operators xed at m = 0, m + = 1, as
easily seen, (1) reduces to the well known quantum algebra uq(su(2)) [3] given by

[s3, s] = s, [s+, s] = [2s3]q.

(9)

now the simplest representation ~s = 1
2~ derives the integrable xxz spin chain [5], from
(5). on the other hand, representation (7) with the corresponding reduction of (8) as g(u) =
2 recovers the quantum exact lattice sine-gordon model [14] with its
2 sin  [1 + cos (2u + 1)]
lax operator obtained directly from (5) with all cs = 1 ( which is compatible with m =
0, m + = 1).

another unusual lie algebra can be generated from (1) by xing the eigenvalues of cs as

2 = 0 which correspond to the values m = 1. this gives an

c+
1 = c2 = 1,
exponentially deformed lie algebra

c1 = c+

[s+, s] =

e2is3
2i sin 

.

(10)

and reduces (8) to g(u) = (1+ei(2u+1))
. the lax operator (5) with these values of cs and the
2 sin 
explicit form of g(u) clearly yields the exact lattice version of the quantum liouville model [15].
note that the present values of m may be achieved even with c1 6= 0, giving the same algebra
(since (1) depends only on m ) and hence the same realization. however, the lax operator
which depends explicitly on cs gets changed reducing (5) to another nontrivial structure. this
is an interesting possibility of constructing systematically dierent useful lax operators for

the same model. for example, the present construction of the second liouville lax operator
recovers easily that of [6], invented in an involved way for its bethe ansatz solution. on the
2 = 1, c1 = iq, c2 = i
other hand for a bit asymmetric choice of eigenvalues:
leading to m + = 2sin , m = 2icos  we may use another realization

c+
1 = c+

s+ = a, s = a, s3 = n,  = i(cot )

(11)

which reduces (1) directly to the well known q-oscillator algebra [16, 17]:

[a, n] = a,

[a, n] = a,

[a, a] =

cos((2n + 1))

cos 

.

(12)

note that such direct derivation of q-oscillator algebra is not possible to obtain from the
quantum algebra uq(su(2)). another interesting point is that, the coproduct structure (6) of
the casimir operators (ci ) = ci  ci clearly contradicts the present values of ca , a = 1, 2,
which leads to the q-oscillator algebra (12). this provides perhaps an unexpected argument
why q-oscillator algebra lacks the hopf algebra structure. thus we have constructed a new
quantum integrable q-oscillator model, from which a more physical model can also be obtained.
using the realization (7) with (8) simplied as g2(u) = [2u]q and the mapping to the bosonic
2 , n = s  u, with [, ] = 1, we can express the q-oscillator
operators:  = eip((s  u))
through standard bosons as a = ( [2n ]q
2 , n =  . this converts the integrable q-
oscillator model into a bosonic model representing an exact lattice version of the quantum
derivative nonlinear schrodinger equation (qdnls) [11] with (5) yielding the corresponding
lax operator. the qdnls was shown to be related to the interacting bose gas with derivative
-function potential [18]. fusing two such models one can further create an integrable massive
thirring model described in [2].

since our quadratic algebra allows also trivial eigenvalues for m, we may choose even
m = 0. note that this case may be achieved with dierent sets of eigenvalues for c as
i) c+
1 = 1, with the rest of cs being zeros. all
these sets of values lead to the same underlying algebra

a = 1 , a = 1, 2, or ii) c1 = 1, or iii) c+

[s+, s] = 0, [s3, s] = s.

(13)

however, they may generate dierent lax operators from (5) due to its explicit dependence
on c. in particular, case i) leads to the light-cone sg model, while ii) and iii) give two dierent
lax operators found in [19] and [20] for the same relativistic toda chain. we have also seen
above such examples of constructing dierent convenient lax operators for the same liouville
model. in the present case (8) gives simply g(u) =const., therfore interchanging canonically
u  ip, p  iu, (7) yields

(14)

s3 = ip, s = eu

and the ancestor lax operator generates evidently the discrete-time or relativistic quantum
toda chain.

3.2 models belonging to the rational class

for covering a wide range of models trough reductions of our ancestor model various free
parameters are inbuilt in it. one of them is the deformation parameter q = e, which was
kept generic for the above trigonometric class. now we consider the undeformed limit q  1 or
equivalently   0 for generating the isotropic or the nonrelativistic models belonging to the
rational class and examine how the structure of the main objects in our scheme gets suitably
modied. it is immediate that for the existence of such a limit the central elements along
with the generators must be  dependent. a consistent procedure leads to s  is, m + 
m+, m  m,   1 + i reducing (1) to the algebraic relations

[s+, s] = 2m+s3 + m,

[s3, s] = s

(15)

1c0

2, m = c1

with m+ = c0
2 as the new central elements. we see again that it is
not a lie but a qda, since the multiplicative operators m can not be removed in general
due to their allowed zero eigenvalues. moreover, algebra (15) is also a hopf algebra with the
coproduct structure

giving (m+) = m+  m+, (m) = m+  m + m  m+. an unusual feature of (15) can
be observed from (17), that though being an undeformed algebra it is noncocommutative in
nature.

the ancestor lax operator (5) at the limit   0 is converted naturally into

lr() =   c0

1( + s3) + c1

2(  s3)  c1

(17)

with rational dependence on spectral parameter  and the quantum r-matrix (3) is reduced
also to its rational form with

a() =  + , b() = ,

c = ,

(18)

well known for the nls model [2]. therefore the integrable systems associated with algebra
(15) and generated by ancestor model (17) would belong now to a dierent class, namely the
rational class, all sharing the same rational r-matrix (18). the corresponding models, a few
examples of which are listed in the appendix, are of nonrelativistic or the isotropic type.

it is interesting to nd that at   0 the operator function (8) after putting  = 0 gives
2 , which using the inter-bosonic map reduces the

g0(u) = i((s  u)(m+(u + s + 1) + m))
representation (7) into a generalized holstein-primakov transformation (hpt)

1

s3 = s n,

s+ = g0(n),

s = g0(n),

g2
0(n) = m + m+(2s n), n = . (19)

it can be checked to be an exact realization of (15) associated with the lax operator (17) and
therefore may be considered as an integrable generalized lattice nls model. this may serve
now as an ancestor model for the rational class. for generating rst the standard homogeneous
models we choose constant eigenvalues for the casimir operators. one such choice m+ =
1, m = 0, reduces (15) clearly to the su(2) algebra, which for spin 1
2 representation gives
the xxx spin chain [21] from the lax operator (17). bosonic realization (19) in this case
simplies to the standard hpt with g2
0(n) = (2s ), reproducing the known lattice nls
model [14] from (17).
a complementary choice m+ = 0, m = 1, on the other hand converts (19) simply to
s+ = , s = , s3 = s  n due to g0(n) = 1 and reduces (15) directly to the oscillator
algebra

[, n] = ,

[, n] = ,

[, ] = 1.

(20)

(17) with this realization generates another simple lattice nls model [22]. remarkably, the
trivial choice m = 0 gives again algebra (13) and therefore the same realization (14) found
for the relativistic case can also be used for the nonrelativistic toda chain [2]. the related
lax operator associated with the rational r-matrix, however should be obtained from (17).
it should be noted that a bosonic realization of general lax operators like (5) and (17) can be
found also in some earlier works [4, 23].

4 field models and classical models

as we required, our ancestor model apart from the discrete quantum systems obtained above,
is capable also of constructing the integrable family of quantum eld models as well as classical
discrete and eld models at dierent limits. for obtaining the quantum eld models we have
to start from their respective lattice versions constructed above and scale the lattice operators
pj, uj, ca , j, consistently by the lattice spacing . at the continuum limit   0 one would
obtain the eld operators pj  p(x), j  (x) etc. along with the commutation relations
like [j, k] = jk
  [(x), (y)] = (x y). the corresponding lax operator l(x, ) for the
continuum model is obtained from its discrete counterpart as lj()  i + il(x, ) + o(2).
the associated r-matrix however remains the same, since it does not contain lattice constant
. thus integrable eld models like sine-gordon, liouville, nls or the derivative nls models
are obtained (see appendix) from their discrete variants constructed above.

at the classical limit h  0, all the eld operators are converted into ordinary functions
with their commutators reducing to the poisson brackets. note that the h enters the r-matrix
as the scaling factor h into its elements, which in turn determine the structure constants of
the algebraic relations. therefore the ancestor algebras (1) and (15) are converted into the
poisson algebras and the r-matrix to its classical form: r() = i + h() + o(h2). however
our basic scheme remains almost the same. remarkably, the quantum parameter does not
enter the lax operators explicitly therefore the form of the ancestor lax operators (5) and

(17) remains in the same form also in the classical limit. therefore we can use all the above
reductions of the ancestor models for generating the classical model with the same success.

5 inhomogeneous models

as mentioned above the ancestor model (5) and its undeformed variant (17) containing non-
trivial casimir operators can be used for constructing a new class of integrable inhomogeneous
models. for this the eigenvalues of the casimir operators should be chosen as site dependent,
and in general time dependent functions.

notice that in the sine-gordon model unlike its coupling constant the mass parameter
enters through the casimir operator of the underlying algebra. therefore taking m +
j =
(mj)2, one can construct a variable mass (in general time dependent) discrete sg model
without spoiling its integrability. in the continuum limit it would result a novel variable mass
sine-gordon eld model with the hamiltonian

h = z dxhm(x, t)(ut)2 + (1/m(x, t))(ux)2 + 8(m0  m(x, t) cos(2u))i ,

(21)

which may arise also in physical situations [24].

inhomogeneous lattice nls model can be obtained by considering site-dependent values for
central elements in (17) and in the generalized hpt (19). as a possible quantum eld model
it may correspond to equations like cylindrical nls [25] with explicit coordinate dependent
coecients.
in a similar way inhomogeneous versions of liouville model, (non)relativistic
toda etc. can be constructed. for example, taking ca
j in nonrelativistic toda chain we
can get a new integrable inhomogeneous quantum toda chain with the hamiltonian

1  ca

(pj +

h = xj

c1
j
c0

)2 +

1
c0
j c0

j+1

eujuj+1.

(22)

note that such inhomogeneities can not be removed through gauge transformation or variable
change, if the inhomogeneity ca

j are time-dependent functions.

another way of constructing inhomogeneous models is to use dierent realizations of al-
gebras (1) or (15) at dierent lattice sites, depending on the type of r-matrix. this may
lead even to dierent underlying algebras and hence dierent lax operators at diering sites
opening up possibilities of building various exotic inhomogeneous models. for example, it
may be possible to construct a hybrid models of sine-gordon and liouville elds, where for
x  0 it would follow the sine-gordon dynamics, while for x < 0 the liouville dynamics. such
dierent possibilities of model constructions will be dealt elsewhere.

similarly nontrivial examples of impurity xxz (or xxx) spin chains can be obtained, if
we replace its standard lax operator at a single impurity site m by the ancestor model (5) (or
(17)) itself or any of its representations (in spin, q-oscillator or boson). this would give rise

to integrable quantum spin chains with impurity of various nature, which might have physical
signicance. such a spin hamiltonian with impurity would look like

h = ( xj6=m,m1

lxxx(0)



jj+1(lxxx(0))1

jj+1 + ld(0)

mm+1lb(d))1



mm+1

+ld(0)mm1(lxxx(0)



m+1m1lxxx(0)1

m+1m1)ld(0)1

mm1)

where lxxx() and ld() correspond to the spin and the impurity lax operators, respectively.
such a lax operator with bosonic impurity may be derived from (17) as

6 concluding remarks

thus we have prescribed an unifying scheme for constructing integrable systems, which cov-
ers quantum lattice as well as eld models of both relativistic or anisotropic (with q 6= 1)
and nonrelativistic or isotropic models (with q = 1) along with their corresponding classical
counterparts. such models can be generated systematically from a single ancestor model with
underlying algebra (1). in general using the freedom of choosing the eigenvalues of the casimir
operators appearing in the algebra to be site as well as time dependent functions, we obtain
inhomogeneous quantum integrable models constituting a new class. the lax operators of the
descendant models are constructed from (5) or its q  1 limit (17), while the variety of their
concrete representations are obtained from the same general form (7) at dierent realizations.
the corresponding underlying algebraic structures are the allowed reductions of (1). the asso-
ciated quantum r-matrix of the descendant models however remains the same trigonometric
or the rational form as inherited from the ancestor model. this answers to the mystery why a
wide range of integrable models are found to share the same r-matrices. this fact also shows
an intimate relationship among the descendant models inspite of their seemingly wide external
dierences and reveals a universal character for solving these models through algebraic bethe
ansatz (aba) [2, 26], where the elements of the associated r-matrix plays the major role.
