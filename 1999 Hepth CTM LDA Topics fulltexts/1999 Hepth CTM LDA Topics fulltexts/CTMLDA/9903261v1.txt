speculations on ads/cft at all orders in 1/n

damtp, silver street, cambridge cb3 9ew, uk

a simple ansatz is considered for the scalar eld dependence of the part of the four-
graviton scattering amplitude in type iib superstring theory in ads5  s5 that comes
from the (weyl tensor)4 term. this incorporates sl(2, zz) duality at every order of the
/l2 expansion (where l is the ads5 scale). the relative coecients in this series are
determined, via the ads/cft correspondence, by the contribution of a single yangmills
instanton to the correlation function of four energy-momentum tensors in the n = 4
su (n ) yangmills theory, which is known exactly for all values of n . the resulting
series is not borel summable, which suggests that some puzzling contributions that are
nonperturbative in /l2 = (g2
y m n )1 (where gy m is the yangmills coupling constant)
may be present in the complete expression.

the conjectured equivalence of type iib superstring theory in ads5s5 to the bound-
ary n = 4 supersymmetric su (n ) yangmills conformal eld theory has been tested by
a variety of calculations at leading order in the large-n limit and at large values of the t
hooft coupling,  = g2
y m is the yangmills coupling constant. this paper
considers features of the equivalence that might apply at all orders in the 1/n expansion
and give some hints about its nonperturbative completion. what follows is speculative! it
is motivated by general considerations of sl(2, zz) duality and by the detailed correspon-
dence between known properties of d-instanton eects in iib string theory and calculable
yangmills instanton eects in n = 4 supersymmetric yangmills theory.
clearly, the ideal way of developing the ads/cft correspondence beyond the limited
region in which it has so far been studied would be to explicitly quantize superstring theory
in an ads5  s5 background. unfortunately, this is a daunting problem, even at tree level
 in part because of the presence of a nonzero condensate of r  r background elds
associated with the nonzero f5 ux. in the absence of an explicit construction of string
amplitudes most concrete calculations have made use of low order terms in the expansion
of the eective supergravity action in powers of the dimensionless parameter /l2 where
l is the size of the ads5 (and s5) background and 1/2 is the string distance scale. the
input in the following will be a combination of constraints that follow from the sl(2, zz)
duality symmetry of type iib superstring theory in ads5 s5 and its image as montonen
olive duality of n = 4 supersymmetric yangmills theory on the boundary of the space,
together with general features of the large-n expansion. the main features that will
be discussed in sections 24 are properties that are based on an ansatz for the scalar
eld dependence of a particular protected contribution to the four-graviton scattering
amplitude in type iib string theory in the ads5  s5 background that might be valid
to all orders in the /l2 expansion. this translates into an explicit expression for the
coupling constant dependence of a corresponding contribution to the correlation function
of four energy-momentum tensors in the boundary n = 4 su (n ) yangmills theory that
would hold to all orders in the 1/n expansion. the last part of the paper (sections 5 and
6) will consider the convergence properties of this series and give evidence for eects that
are nonperturbative in /l2 (or 1/4).

1.1. overview

according to the ads/cft correspondence [1,2,3] the amplitudes of the bulk super-
string theory in the ads5  s5 background with elds propagating to specied values at
points on the boundary are equivalent to correlation functions of composite operators in
the boundary yangmills theory. the boundary values of the bulk elds are interpreted as
sources coupling to the operators in the yangmills theory. the parameters of the string
theory  the dimensionless ads5  s5 scale l2/, the r  r scalar eld, c(0), and the
coupling constant g = e =  1
 are related to those of the yangmills theory with gauge
group su (n ) by

that the constant value of the complex coupling constant,   1 + i2 = c(0) + ie, in
the ads5  s5 background is identied with the complex yangmills coupling,

the arguments that follow will exploit special features of certain supergravity inter-
actions that are protected by supersymmetry. we will be particularly concerned with
the part of the correlation of four energy-momentum tensors in the yangmills theory
that is related by the ads/cft correspondence to a protected component of the four-
graviton amplitude in the ads5  s5 string theory. this is the part of the amplitude that
comes from the linearization of a particular contraction of four weyl tensors, r4. the
term of this form of lowest order in  in the iib eective action is the well-known term,
g
e/2 f (0,0)(, )r4, where g(10) is the determinant of the ads5  s5 metric and
the coecient f (0,0)(, ) is a modular invariant function of the complex scalar eld,  (see
[4] for further information and for notational details). this gives rise to a four-graviton
amplitude of the form 1 1/2
2 f (0,0)(, ) a4 where a4 contains the kinematic factor that
folllows from the contraction of the linearized weyl tensors in r4. more generally, in the
following we will denote the complete four-graviton scattering amplitude with specied
data on the boundary of ads5  s5 (in the string frame) by

hs(/l2, , ) a4,

(1.3)

where the coecient hs is a function of the scalar elds and the scale of the background.
the symbol a4 will also be used in the following as a shorthand way of representing the
corresponding protected part of the correlation function of four energy-momentum tensors
in the boundary yangmills theory. the function hs will be expanded in powers of /l2
at xed g,

where the possibility has been indicated of terms that are nonperturbative in /l2. in
writing (1.4) it has been assumed, for reasons that will become apparent later, that only odd
powers of  arise (which means that the yangmills theory expansion is in integer inverse
powers of n for xed gy m ). the coecient functions hs
l (, ) must be invariant under the
sl(2, zz) duality of type iib string theory in ads5  s5 which is inherited from the theory
in at space and is linked via the ads/cft correspondence to montonenolive duality
of the boundary yangmills theory. this requires that hs
l be invariant under sl(2, zz)
transformations which act on  in the usual manner,   (a + b)/(c + d) (ad  bc = 1
and a, b, c, d  zz).

the rst term in the  expansion of hs is  1/2

1(2)l2/ (whereas the classical
einsteinhilbert term is of order 4) where hs
1  f (0,0) has a well-established form [5,6,7]
that can be derived as a consequence of supersymmetry [8]. although hs
1 has a highly non-
trivial dependence on the scalar eld  it has the form of a simple eisenstein series that can
be obtained by acting on the tree level contribution (3) 3/2
2 with the elements of sl(2, z)
that map the semi-innite rectangle,  1
2 , 2 > 0, into itself. an overview of
properties of hs
1 and its image in the boundary yangmills theory will be given in section
2, where it will be expressed as a fourier series of the form hs
k(2)e2ik1. the
zero mode f 1
0 (2) contains string tree-level and one-loop contributions while the nonzero
modes dene an innite series of d-instanton terms. of particular interest will be the cor-
respondence between these d-instanton contributions and the contribution of instantons
in the large-n yangmills theory. the contribution of k instantons (or anti instantons)
has been explicitly evaluated by use of the adhm construction in the large-n limit and at
leading order in gy m [9,10]. in this limit the dominant contribution comes from the region
of k-instanton moduli space in which the instantons are in mutually commuting su (2)
subgroups of su (n ) and are coincident and of the same scale. this matches perfectly
with the expression predicted from the ads/cft correspondence [11,12]. of particular
note for later sections of this paper is the fact that the leading contribution to the single
(k = 1) instanton contribution in the su (n ) yangmills theory is known exactly for all
values of n [13].

1 pk f 1

in section 3 some arguments will be presented concerning the possible form of the
general term at order (/l2)2l3 (l > 0) in the expansion of hs. this function, hs
l (,  ), is
constrained by the fact that it must be invariant under sl(2, zz) and its large-2 expansion
must satisfy the condition that its power-behaved terms correspond to powers of 2 that can
arise in perturbation theory. although these conditions do not by themselves completely
determine hs, they are obviously very constraining. they suggest that the general term,
hs
l , could be a simple generalization of the lowest order eisenstein series. thus, we will
l (l > 1) is given by acting on the o(2l3) tree-level terms
consider the possibility that hs
by the elements of sl(2, zz) that map the semi-innite rectangle into itself. this motivates
the ansatz

(, ),

(1.5)

l

where f (0,0)
is a nonholomorphic eisenstein series (actually, an epstein zeta function) that
is dened in section 3.1. only the terms with odd powers of  give sensible contributions.
clearly, if this suggestion is correct it should be possible to derive it from the constraints
of supersymmetry in the ads5  s5 background by an extension of the arguments used
for the l = 1 case [8].
in the absence of such a proof we will obtain further support for the expression (1.5)
by considering particular classes of higher derivative contributions to the ten-dimensional
iib eective action. we are particularly interested in the conjectured terms in [14,15] since
they contribute to the interaction lagrangian r4 that generates the four-graviton amplitude
(1.3) in the ads5  s5 background. the scalar eld dependence of these conjectured
terms enters via precisely the same eisenstein series as (1.5). of course, there are many
other possible contributions to the r4 interaction about which we know nothing, possibly

3

including many terms that do not originate from local interactions in ten dimensions.

section 4 is concerned with the interpretation in the boundary yangmills theory of
the supergravity amplitude suggested in section 3. in the t hooft expansion of large-n
yangmills [16] it is natural to choose n ,  = gn (with g = g2
y m /4) and  as the inde-
pendent parameters. in order to emphasize which variables are taken to be independent
we will dene the coupling-dependent coecient of the yangmills correlation function as

y m

h

(, n, ) = hs(/l2, , ).

(1.6)

combining this with (1.4) and (1.5) gives an explicit large-n expansion with xed  of the
correlation function of four energy-momentum tensors in terms of the unknown coecients
cl. this will turn out to be an expansion in integer powers of 1/n 2 as expected from [16]
(whereas the expansion with xed g is in integer powers of 1/n ). the leading (tree-level)
string theory terms are independent of the string coupling constant (apart from an overall
factor of g2) and translate into the leading (order n 0) terms in the large-n limit of
yangmills theory, which form an innite series of inverse powers of . however, at order
n 2k (all k > 0) there is only a single contribution, which is proportional to k1/2 and
originates from the k-loop string amplitude. in addition there is an innite series of yang
mills instanton terms that come from the d-instanton contributions. the leading term in
the 1/n expansion rather trivially satises (g/g  n /n )h
is the leading contribution to h
in the large-n limit with xed . this is simply a
translation of the statement in string theory that the tree-level terms are independent of
the coupling (when normalized by a factor of  2
2 ). we will suggest that this relation is
replaced by a sl(2, zz)-covariant generalization in the complete theory, which takes the
form of a laplace equation for the complete series.

up to this point the coecients cl of the terms in the /l2 expansion (1.4) are
undetermined. however, the values of these coecients are easily extracted by comparing
the exactly known n -dependence of the single instanton contribution in the su (n ) yang
mills theory [13] with the one-instanton contribution to h
. in section 5 we will see that
the large-order behaviour of these coecients is such that while the leading one-instanton
contribution to the four-graviton amplitude is well dened by the 1/n expansion, the
complete series is not. for example, the large-order behaviour of the relative coecients in
the /l2 series renders the sum of tree contributions badly divergent. in fact, the series
is not borel summable which suggests that missing nonperturbative eects must be taken
into account in order to understand the relation between the weak and strong coupling
limits [17,18,19]. we will see that the presence of this divergence is in accord with various
pieces of intuition. for example, we will see evidence of the qualitative change in the
nature of the instanton contribution when k (the instanton number) is of the same order
of magnitude as n . that such a change is inevitable is evident from the fact that when
|k| > n/2 it is impossible to t all the instantons into commuting su (2) subgroups of
su (n ).
this non borel summability is reminiscent of divergences in the sum of perturbation
series in yangmills eld theory and in string perturbation theory. these are sometimes
(but not always) associated with the presence of instantons. for example, the diver-
gent sum of perturbative string theory suggested the presence of instanton eects [20,21],

4

that were later associated with d-branes [22]. in the present case, the divergence of the
sum of tree diagrams indicates that eects of the form econst. g2
are
present in the nonperturbative completion of the amplitude. there is no obvious geo-
metric origin for such a contribution which is puzzling since it looks as though it ought
to be associated with some sort of instanton. in addition, the divergence in the sum of
contributions to the charge-k instanton terms suggests a non-perturbative eect that be-
haves as econst. 82n/g2
in the sector with nonzero instanton number
k << n (while the usual yangmills instanton eects behave as e82|k|/g2

there are many other processes of the same order in  that are related to the r4

the presence of all of these terms can be motivated by various duality relationships between

full nonlinear supersymmetry, as demonstrated in [8]. there it was shown that modular
invariance of type iib supergravity together with supersymmetry uniquely xes the form
of these protected interactions at order 1.

which is a series of d-instanton contributions, where k is the d-instanton charge (k > 0
terms are d-instanton contributions while k < 0 terms are anti d-instanton contributions).

the measure factor is dened by (k, 1) = pm|k m2, which is a sum over the divisors
of k. the zero d-instanton term, f 1
0 , contains two power-behaved contributions that
arise in string perturbation theory, which are tree-level and one-loop contributions. the
coecients of the d-instanton terms are precisely dened by (2.7), including an innite
series of perturbative uctuations around any charge-k d-instanton.

according to the ads/cft correspondence it is natural to expect that the eects of
d-instantons in the string theory are seen in the boundary yangmills theory as eects of
yangmills instantons [11]. recall [12] that a classical d-instanton solution of euclidean
iib supergravity located at a position (x
0 , 0) ( = 0, 1, 2, 3) in ads5 (and at an arbitrary
position on the ve-sphere) is a conguration in which e =  1
2 has a prole on the bound-
ary at (x,  = 0) that is identical to the self-dual eld strength, (f 
)2, of a yangmills
instanton of scale size 0 located at x
0 in the four-dimensional boundary conformal eld
theory. the correspondence between bulk and boundary instanton eects is made precise
by comparing the eects of d-instantons in the protected supergravity amplitudes with the
yangmills instanton eects in the corresponding correlation functions of superconformal
currents in the boundary theory. at rst sight it is rather surprising that the form of
the correlation functions agree (to leading order in the yangmills coupling) even in the
case of a single instanton in the su (2) theory [12]. however, the contribution of a single
yangmills instanton in su (n ) n = 4 yangmills theory to the protected processes has
been obtained [13] and the n -dependence results in a multiplicative factor proportional to

(2.8)

which behaves as n 1/2 in the large-n limit (using stirlings approximation for the large-n
behaviour of the  functions), which is in accord with the ads/cft conjecture since the
protected terms are of order 1/. even more suggestively, the k-instanton contribution to
any protected correlation function of the yangmills theory in [9,10] agrees exactly with
the leading term in the contribution of k d-instantons in type iib superstring theory.
this agreement presumably follows from the very restrictive constraints of supersymmetry
so it might be possible to generalize the arguments in [8] to n = 4 yangmills theory and
thus to determine the yang-mills correlation functions exactly at order n 1/2.

several features of these multi-instanton contributions are worth noting. the region
of the k d-instanton moduli space that dominates the protected bulk processes is one in
which there is a single charge-k d-instanton spanning ads5  s5 rather than separate
d-instantons with lower charges. this is a consequence of the fact that the protected
processes are ones in which exactly sixteen fermionic zero modes are soaked up by the
external sources. using the ads/cft correspondence this is understood as follows. a
single instanton in su (2) n = 4 supersymmetric yangmills theory has sixteen fermionic
zero modes, which is equal to the number of broken superconformal symmetries. when
embedded in su (n ) there are apparently extra fermionic zero modes, but only sixteen
of these are protected by supersymmetry against perturbative corrections. the result is
that in the quantum theory the eective number of fermionic zero modes is still sixteen,
independent of n . furthermore, the fact that the protected processes soak up precisely
sixteen fermionic zero modes forces the dominant contribution of k yangmills instantons
to these processes in the large-n limit to come from the region of moduli space in which
there are k coincident instantons, all of which are of equal scale, which are embedded in
commuting su (2) subgroups of su (n ) [9,10]. the measure contains a factor of g8
y m inde-
pendent of n and k. the classical moduli space for k coincident yangmills instantons
of equal scale is ads5. however, an extra factor of s5 in the moduli space arises from
a saddle point evaluation of the integration over the uctuating fermionic elds in the
k-instanton background in the large-n limit [9,10]. this description therefore agrees with
the expectation that follows from the bulk superstring description. however, it depends
crucially on the n   limit. for nite n such congurations may continue to dominate
for |k| << n but when |k|  n/2 it is not possible to t the instantons into commuting
subgroups of su (n ) and a qualitative change in the correspondence must arise.

the explicit comparison of the yangmills k-instanton results with the supergravity
predictions has been carried out only to leading order in g2
y m (and to leading order in
1/n in the n   limit). however, the superconformal yangmills theory is expected
to exhibit montonenolive duality, so all correlation functions must be invariant under
appropriate sl(2, z) transformations. given that the innite number of leading yang
mills instanton terms agree with the expectations based on the ads/cft correspondence
there seems little doubt that sl(2, z) will x the modular function at order (/l2)1
to be precisely that predicted in [11]. however, the full expression for f (0,0)
includes the
power behaved terms of the zero instanton sector that are singular in the weak coupling
limit and, at the very least, these terms cannot be determined by perturbative methods.

of which (2.7) is a special case. the zero fourier mode f l
0 is the dominant contribution
for large 2 and contains the tree-level and l-loop terms. the nonzero modes f l
k (k 6=
0) are the charge-k d-instanton contributions when k is positive and anti d-instanton
contributions when k is negative. the series of terms in the last parentheses in (3.11) arises
from the expansion of the bessel function and represent the innite series of perturbative
uctuations around each d-instanton.

the expression (3.11) can be obtained from (3.2) as follows. the tree-level contri-
bution (the rst term on the right-hand side of (3.6)) comes from the sum over m with
n = 0. the other terms are obtained from the terms in (3.2) with n 6= 0 after a poisson

summation which replaces m by the conjugate integer m. the second power-behaved term
on the right-hand side of (3.6) comes from the sum over n 6= 0 with m = 0 and corresponds
to a perturbative string theory term that arises at l loops. the terms in f l
k (k 6= 0) are
associated with d-instantons with charge k = mn. each (anti) d-instanton contributes

generalized in the ads5  s5 background so that hs

all values of l > 0 since this would provide a derivation of the ansatz (3.1). the set of

3.2. eective type iib action at higher orders in /l2

in partial support of the identicaton (3.1) we shall now consider how higher powers
of /l2 in the four-graviton amplitude can arise from the presence of higher derivative
terms in the iib eective action. we are interested in terms that contain a contribution
of the generic form,

2l3z d10xp g(10) ol hs

l (,  )r4

(3.14)

when expanded around the ads5s5 background, where ol is a function of the background
values of the type iib elds of dimension l4(l1) whereas r4 is made from the uctuating
weyl curvature, g(10) is the background ads5  s5 metric and l  1. the l = 1 case
corresponds to the o(1) terms reviewed in the previous section. as with (1.4), the
important assumption has been made in writing this series that only odd powers of 
arise, which is equivalent to assuming in the yangmills theory that only integer powers
of 1/n arise in the series of corrections to the leading term. such a property should reect
some symmetry property of the r4 term in the ads5  s5 background.
since all the elds in ol are set to their background values (3.14) denes a series
expansion of the scalar eld dependence of the complete r4 term of the general form
(1.4) (with appropriate factors of e absorbed into redenitions of hs
l ). the value of the
riemann curvature in the ads5  s5 background is

lower case latin indices, m, n, . . . = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 label the s5 coordinates. the self-dual
ve-form eld strength f5 = dc(4) also has a nonzero background value given by,

l

(volads5 + vols5 ),

(3.16)

while the complex scalar eld  is constant. the background values of all other elds,
including the antisymmetric three-form eld strengths vanish (g = 0 = g, where g
is a complex linear combination of the r  r and n s  n s antisymmetric tensor eld
strengths). this solution is one which describes a conguration in which there are n units
of quantized ve-form ux, which can be associated with a superposition of n d3-branes
in the large-n limit. changing the value of n is equivalent to changing the ads scale,
g1/2l2/.

specic examples of such higher-derivative terms have been suggested in some fairly
well-motivated conjectures 3. for example in [14,15] it was suggested that there is an
innite series of terms in the eective action of the form (in einstein frame) 4,

the coecients cl,l are undetermined constants that dene the relative weights of the

(3.18)
since g = 0 = g in the ads5  s5 background the only terms in (3.17) which
contribute to the r4 term in this background are those containing powers of f 4

the form (1.3) with hs given by (1.4) and hs
of course, these arguments do not prove the correctness of the ansatz (1.5) even if
the conjectures in [14,15] are true since it is extremely likely that the eective action also
contains many other local higher-derivative terms involving a r4 factor, in which higher
powers of the riemann curvature also occur. the generic form of the lagrangian density
of these terms is p(r, f5)r4, where the prefactor p is a tensor function of the elds with
indices that may contract into the indices on the curvature tensors in r4. however, all
that is of interest to us are terms that give a nonzero coecient of r4 in the ads5  s5
background. in other words, p can be considered to be a function only of f5 and r (the
riemann or ricci tensor) but not of r (the curvature scalar) or other elds with vanishing
background values. furthermore, each power of the curvature is dimensionally equivalent
to two powers of f5 in the derivative expansion. an example of a structure that is plausibly
present is

where the index structure has intentionally been omitted since there are many possible
ways in which the contractions of indices can be distributed. only even powers of r have
been included, following the earlier assumption that only odd powers of  occur in the
r4 term in ads5  s5. when the elds are set equal to their background values, r = r0,
f5 = f 0

these functions with f (0,0)

in addition to the above contributions to the r4 interaction there could well be terms

proportional to f (0,0)

which is characteristic of a string k-loop eect. if the expression for h
is indeed given
by a single power-behaved term then the unknown nonperturbative contribution in (4.4),
r2, must play an essential role in the continuation from large  to small . this follows
from the fact that the small- feynman rules generate a series expansion for h
k with
integer powers of , starting with 2k, whereas (4.4) contains a single half-integer power.
these two behaviours can only be reconciled if there are nonperturbative terms in (4.4) so
that r2 is nonvanishing. there are very many possible functions that reproduce k1/2
for large  and give a sensible small- expansion. one randomly chosen example is the

approximation follows from the right-hand side and is given by 2k  (2k + 1)2ke/ +
o(e4/).
in addition to the terms that are power behaved in in 1/n 2 in (4.1), the nonper-
turbative d-instanton eects generate the dependence on  (or 1) that is crucial for the
sl(2, zz) duality of the theory and will play a key role in determining coecients in the
following section.

(4.10)

(4.11)

this is the equation that the complete expression (4.1) satises term by term in the
/l2 = (4)1 expansion.

equation (4.10) only applies in the approximation that the n -dependence can be
treated as if n is continuous. furthermore, it does not x the relative coecients of the
terms hs
l that arise in the expansion (1.4). in order to take nite n eects into account the
continuous derivatives with respect to n in (4.11) should be replaced by some sort of nite
dierence operators. an appropriate nite-n denition of the laplace operator should
lead to a generalization of (4.10) that determines the complete function hs, thereby xing
the coecients in the /l2 expansion and determining the nonperturbative completion.
precisely how this works is an interesting question in su (n ) yangmills theory at nite
n that should be related to the renormalization group approach to matrix models [27].
in the absence of any such understanding we will now invoke a more modest strategy for
determining the coecients.

5. nonsummability and nonperturbative eects

5.1. general considerations concerning convergence

if the series expansion in powers of /l2 (or 1) with xed g converged it could
dene the exact expression function hs. however, we have already seen that even the
tree-level series (4.3) is unlikely to converge. in fact, we will argue within the context of
our ansatz that neither the full series nor the tree-level series are borel summable. for
example, the tree level contribution, obtained by substituting the expansion of f (0,0)
in
(1.3), (1.4) and (1.6) is

l

n 2 h

y m

0 = n 2

322 cl (2l + 1) (4)l1/2,

(5.1)

which ignores the possible nonperturbative contributions in r1. the convergence proper-
ties of this sum depend crucially on the behaviour of the coecients cl in (1.4). we will
see in 5.2 that these coecients are such that this series diverges so that the additional
terms in r1 that are nonperturbative in 2/l4 = (4)1 are needed to give a sensible
denition of hs.
(see (3.11)) corresponds to a l-loop
correction to the protected four-graviton amplitude. substituting this into (1.3) gives the
sum,

where (k, l) is dened in (3.8) and only the leading term has been shown explicitly. we
will soon compare this in the case k = 1 with the exact expression for the leading term in
the one-instanton sector of su (n ) yangmills and thereby determine the coecients cl. to
get a feel for the properties of this series consider the special case with k a prime number.
in this case (k, l) = 1 + 1/k 2l  1 for large k. the essential k-dependence is then
obtained by replacing n 1 in the one-instanton expression (2.8) by the ratio r  |k|/n .
but we see that the expression is singular when r = 2. this means that for values of |k|
that are of order n the  expansion fails. recall that the d-instanton correspondence
works in the region of yangmills instanton moduli space in which k yangmills instantons
are embedded in commuting su (2) subgroups of su (n ). obviously, a qualitative change
is needed in the correspondence when |k|  n/2 and the singularity of (2.8) may be
interpreted as evidence that nonperturbative terms become important at this point. this
eect is closely related to the nonsummability of the  expansion.

5.2. the coecients and properties of sum

in [13] it was shown that the leading contribution to the exact one-instanton term is

proportional to

(2n  2)!

(n  1

(n  1)

which behaves as n 1/2 for large n . let us expand (5.4) as a power series in n 1,

where bl are constant coecients and the series converges for n > 1/2. each term in the
sum (5.5) should be compared with the corresponding term that comes from the k = 1
d-instanton in (5.3). we are here looking at the contribution of the leading term in the
expansion of the bessel function to the expression for f (0,0)
given in (3.11). setting k = 1
in (5.3) (noting (1, l) = 1) tells us that

(5.6)

ignoring an overall normalization.

this expression for cl makes the issue of borel summability of the series that denes

borel transform of hs by,



cl

if the integrand is nonsingular in the region 0  t   the series is borel summable. the

a nonperturbative ambiguity in the denition of the function that cannot be understood

an obvious feature of the t integration is that it is divergent due to the singularity
at t = 2n which is indicative of a breakdown of borel summability of the  series. such
a singularity is well known in many contexts [19], for example in considering the sum of
feynman diagrams in yangmills eld theory as well as the sum of string theory loop
diagrams [20,21]. indeed, a divergence of this type was used to predict the presence of
nonperturbative contributions in string theory [21] that were later described in terms of
d-branes [22].
in the present casev the t singularity is a symptom of the presence of
contributions that are nonperturbative in  that are not included in the /l2 expansion.
tree contributions
we may analyze the series more concretely by rst considering the sum of the leading
order terms in the limit of weak coupling (large 2). this is equivalent to summing all
contributions to the four-graviton amplitude arising from string tree-level contributions in
the ads5  s5 background. substituting for y from (5.11) the dominant terms in the
weak coupling limit that contribute to the sum in (5.12) are those with n = 0, which gives

(5.13)

this has the form of a borel integral in which the borel parameter is t = m2t/2. the
sum of powers of 1/n (5.1) in the n   limit can be recovered if the singularity in t
is simply ignored by, for example, arbitrarily cutting o the t integral at a value t  n .
then, use of stirlings approximation for the gamma functions (5.13) reproduces the series
of tree-level terms (5.1) with cl given by (5.6).

however, the presence of the singularity in hs

borel at t = 2n makes the expression
ill-dened. following the usual folklore [19] this singularity indicates a leading nonpertur-
bative contribution proportional to

n 2 e2m2ng =

(5.14)

which is obtained by setting t = 2n in the integrand of (5.13). terms with this general
behaviour should arise in r1, the nonperturbative completion of the tree-level term in the
1/n expansion. the singularities with m > 1 are exponentially suppressed compared to
the leading, m = 1, singularity when  is large.
it is risky to read too much into the
sum over the nonleading singularities with m > 1. however, if the sum over m is taken
seriously a poisson resummation converts it into a series of terms of the form e m2/2,
which is appropriate for a contribution to r0, the nonperturbative part of the weak coupling
expansion of h
. the preceding discussion does not, by itself, lead to an understanding
of the detailed mechanism that moderates the singular t integral. it is disappointing that
the expression (5.14) is not obviously associated with an identiable geometrical eect
such as a wrapped p-brane. for example, a factor of the form (5.14) could arise from
a euclidean d3-brane wrapped around a sphere of radius  g1/4l but there is no bps
conguration of this type.

as before, the power series in 1/n (5.2) is reproduced if the integral is cut o at t  n . the
singularity of the integral indicates a nonperturbative contribution of the form e2n/g,
but this is exponentially suppressed relative to (5.14) and is therefore subleading.

even though the charge-k d-instanton contributions are exponentially suppressed
in the large n limit when  is xed they are uniquely characterized by the phase factor
e2ik1 and so they can be isolated by substituting (5.15) in (5.12) and picking out the
kth fourier mode with respect to 1. the resultant contribution to h

(5.17)

where k = mn. once again, excluding the t singularity in an arbitrary manner and
expanding the integrand for large n leads to the expected charge-k instanton terms as-
sociated with the bessel function kl(22|k|). in particular, the leading weak coupling
(large 2) behaviour is dominated by the saddle point at

t = tsaddle =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(5.18)

and gives the overall factor e2|k|2 that is associated with the leading asymptotic be-
haviour of the bessel function and governs the leading 2-dependence of the instanton
terms in (5.3).

the presence of the singularity in the integrand at t = tsing = 2n can again be
taken as an indication of the presence of contributions that are nonperturbative in  and
proportional to the exponential factor,

(5.19)

|k|, |n| = 1, and has the form

(5.20)

unlike the nonperturbative contribution implied by the tree-level terms, (5.14), this factor
is suppressed at small coupling.

in order for the asymptotic series of leading instanton contributions (5.3) to have any
validity it is evident that the saddle point tsaddle must be at a smaller value of t than the
singularity tsing, which implies

|k| < 2n

(5.21)

so that the ill-determined nonperturbative contribution (5.20) is exponentially smaller than
the charge-k instanton contribution. but when |k|  2n the contribution associated with
the singularity at t = tsing is as important as the instanton term, which means that the
expression (5.3) cannot be trusted at values of |k|  2n , where the series diverges. in
other words, so long as |k| < 2n the series of instanton terms, (5.3), can be formally
written (using (5.5) and (5.6)) as,

y m

kinst = e2 |k|
h

g ik [(k, n )|k| + o(g)] ,

where the measure (k, n ) is dened by

for |k| << n . however, the nonperturbative eects invalidate this expression close to the
leading singularity at |k| = 2n . since the exact expression for the leading contribution
of k yangmills instantons in su (n ) is calculable (in principle) for any k and n and
cannot be singular, eects embodied in terms such as (5.19) must be crucial for resolving
the singularity in (5.23).

6. comments

we have investigated the possibility that the /l2 expansion of the scalar eld de-
pendence of the the part of the four-graviton amplitude that arises from the linearization
of the r4 term in type iib superstring theory in ads5  s5 is given by a simple sl(2, zz)-
invariant ansatz. the coecients of the /l2 expansion, hs
l , were taken to be those
generated by summing over sl(2, zz) transformations of the tree-level terms, which is
known to be the correct prescription for the leading (1/) term and is also in accord with
the conjectured form of a class of higher-derivative interactions in the iib eective action.
this led to explicit expressions for all terms in the /l2 expansion of the string theory
and hence in the 1/n expansion of the boundary yangmills theory. furthermore, the
explicit form of the contribution of a single yangmills instanton, which is known exactly
for all n , was used to x the relative coecients of the terms in these series.

20

a positive feature of this rather speculative ansatz is that it is straightforward to check
some of its consequences. for example, it makes specic predictions for the coecients
of charge-k yangmills instantons to leading order in the coupling constant and in the
|k| << n limit. the 1 contribution to was contained in [10] and agrees with the l = 1
term in (5.3), but (5.3) also predicts all the nonleading terms in the  expansion. thus,
using (5.6) and (5.5) it is easy to check that the ratio of the second term to the rst term
in (5.3) is

(6.1)

a result that should be testable by extending the expression for the k-instanton contribu-
tion of large-n yangmills [10] to include the rst nonleading terms in the 1/n expansion.
an interesting question is how to complete the denition of the k-instanton measure,
(k, n ), which was formally dened by the power series (5.23). the leading contribution
to  in the large-n limit with |k| << n is proportional to (k, 1), which is the par-
tition function of the su (k) zero-dimensional matrix model [28,29,30,31] that describes
d-instantons. this suggests that the full nite-n expression should correspond to some
generalized matrix model that builds in the the exact dependence on both k and n .
this might be constrained by some exact symmetry that interchanges n and k analo-
gous to nahm duality which is a symmetry of k instantons in su (n ) yangmills theory
compactied on a four-torus.

however, several of the most intriguing issues raised in this paper are also puzzling
and might cast doubt on the ansatz. for example, evidence was found that the /l2 series
diverges and is not borel summable. this suggests the presence of nonperturbative eects
which are reected in the yangmills theory by terms that are nonperturbative in the
inverse t hooft coupling 1. these arise in the coecients, hk(), of the 1/n 2k terms
in the large-n expansion and are of order econst.  when  is large. such eects play a
vital role in the continuation from  >> 1 to  << 1. in supersymmetric quantum eld
theory nonperturbative eects of this type are often associated with instantons, although
this is by no means always true. in the present case the expression (5.14) is suggestive
of a wrapped euclidean d3-brane, but there is no obvious geometrical origin for such a
contribution since there are no appropriate supersymmetric four-cycles.

another puzzle concerns the contribution of conventional instanton eects (of order
e2|k|n/) which were found to change in a qualitative manner when |k|  n , as indi-
cated by the singularity of (k, n ) at |k| = 2n . this is in accord with intuition that
the correspondence between yangmills instantons and d-instantons is only simple when
the dominant congurations are those where the yangmills instantons are in commuting
su (2) subgroups of su (n ). however, the puzzle is that the change over in the instanton
behaviour in (5.22) occurs when |k| = 2n rather than the expected value of |k| = n/2.
these puzzles either indicate interesting features of the nite-n theory or else they
indicate inconsistencies that invalidate the ansatz in its simplest form, (1.5). in the latter
case, they could nevertheless be useful in pointing to further contributions to the protected
four-graviton amplitude in ads5  s5 that may be necessary in order to avoid these
inconsistencies. in any case, the real challenge is to further understand the nonperturbative

21

completion of hs which should be a signicant feature of iib string amplitudes in the
ads5  s5 background.
