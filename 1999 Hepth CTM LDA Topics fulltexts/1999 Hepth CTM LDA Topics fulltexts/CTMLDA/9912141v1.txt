by considering the gradient expansion for the wilsonian eective action sk of a single component
scalar eld theory truncated to the rst two terms, the potential uk and the kinetic term zk, i show
that the recent claim that dierent expansion of the uctuation determinant give rise to dierent
renormalization group equations for zk is incorrect. the correct procedure to derive this equation
is presented and the set of coupled dierential equations for uk and zk is denitely established.

during the last years there has been growing inter-
est for the so called exact renormalization group equa-
tion(s) (erge). actually several questions in eld theory
cannot be addressed within the framework of perturba-
tion theory. the entire subject of symmetry breaking,
the problem of connement in qcd are well known ex-
amples of questions still waiting for an explanation. the
wilsonian renormalization group method [1] seems to
provide an interesting non perturbative approach to this
kind of questions. when the momentum shell of the elim-
inated modes is chosen to be innitesimal, it results in
an integro-dierential equation for the wilsonian eective
action, the action sk at the current scale k, the wegner-
houghton equation [2]. this equation is useless until a
specic ansatz is made which allows for a systematic ap-
proximation scheme. this can be achieved by consider-
ing the derivative expansion, whose lowest order is the so
called local potential approximation (lpa). let us con-
sider a single component scalar eld theory. in the lpa
sk contains only one function, the local potential uk(),
and the erge for sk becomes a dierential equation for
uk. to the next order sk contains in addition the coe-
cient zk() of the lowest order derivative term .
while the derivation of the equation for uk() in the lpa
is straightforward and does not present ambiguities [3,4],
the derivation of the coupled dierential equations for uk
and zk has been plagued by uncertaintes. actually the
authors of [5] have recently applied the expansion of the
uctuation determinant given in [6] to derive these equa-
tions. they nd an equation for zk dierent from the
one that is obtained when the expansion of [7] is applied.
they also computed the eld anomalous dimension .
as from [6] (but not from [7]) they nd the correct two
loop result, they conclude that the expansion introduced
in [6] has the correct uv behaviour while that of [7] is
misleading in the uv region.

by carefully reconsidering the derivation of the equa-
tions for uk and zk following the method of [6] i show
that the equation for zk presented in [5] is incorrect and
that actually both methods [6,7] give one and the same
equation for zk. concerning the anomalous dimension
at two loops we note that being an o(h2) result it comes
from an innite resummation of terms each coming from
a dierent coecient function of the gradient expansion.

so the fact that  at this order comes out from the two
terms uk and zk only should not be used as an argument
to decide about the superiority of one expansion with re-
spect to the other. it should rather been proven that the
contributions coming from the innite terms other then
uk and zk add up to zero. actually we already know that
this does not happen. by using a dierent but equiva-
lent formalism, the computation of  up to two loops
order has been done in [8] where we see that the higher
derivatives actually contribute to .

i will show in the following how to obtain the correct
result. before proceeding to this derivation i review now
the functional method of [6] that was intended to provide
a way to compute the gradient expansion coecients of
the one loop eective action. let us consider a single
component scalar eld theory. the eective action []
is a highly non local functional. it can be given a quasi-
local resemblance through the gradient expansion. up to
second order in the derivatives of the eld,

[] = z d4xhu () +

1
2

z() i.

(1)

for deniteness we work in d = 4 dimensions.
in the
loop expansion, on the other hand, up to one-loop order,

[] = 0[] + 1[],

(2)

r d4xhu () + 1

where 0[] is the tree level (bare) action, 0[] =
and u () is the classical
potential. 1[] is the one-loop contribution to [] and
can also be expanded in powers of the eld derivatives.
again up to second order,

2  i

1[] = z d4xhu1() +

1
2

z1() i.

(3)

u1() and z1() are the one-loop contributions to u ()
and to z() respectively.

it is convenient to introduce a dirac-like notation that
will also be very useful in the following. the one-loop
contribution to the eective action can be written as
(from now on u (n) means the n-th derivative w.r.to )

1[] = t r lnh p 2 + u (2)( (x))i.

(4)

1

in fact the second functional derivative of the bare action,

20[]

(x)(y) = h2
x + u (2)((x))i(x  y), can be repre-
sented as the kernel of the operator p 2 + u (2)( (x)) in
the x-representation once we dene p and u (2)( (x))
to be respectively i and u (2)((x)) in this represen-
tation, and introduce the notation < x|y >= (x  y):

20[]

(x)(y)

=< x|h p 2 + u (2)( (x))i|y > .

(5)

other representations can also be introduced. we are in
particular interested in the p-representation, the trans-
formation function being < x|p >= 1v
eipx (v is the
volume), where traces are conveniently computed :

t r o = xp

< p| o|p >= v z

d4p
(2)4

< p| o|p > .

(6)

the notations above allow us to introduce the complete-
ness relations in the x and p representations :

i = z d4x|x >< x| = xp

|p >< p|.

(7)

we can now state the method of [6] in the following
way. first we write eq.(4), a part for a meaningless in-
nite constant, as (we abbreviate u (2)( (x)) with u (2)):

1[] = z 

0

du t r h p 2 + u (2) + ui1

.

second, by the help of eq.(6), the trace in eq.(8) is:

< p|h p 2 + u (2) + ui1

xp

|p > .

(8)

(9)

third, we rewrite eq. (9) as :

< p|hp2 + u (2) + u  (p2  p 2)i1

xp

|p > .

(10)

eq. (10), were we have just added and subtracted p2,
contains the essence of the method. for any xed value

up to the second order in the derivatives of the eld

around hp2 + u (2) + ui1

of p we want to expand the operator hp2 + u (2) + u 
(p2  p 2)i1
we get ( ap = p2 + u (2) + u and bp = p2  p 2)
t r h p 2 + u (2) + ui1
bp a1

= pp < p|h a1

bp a1

bp a1

+ a1

p + a1

(11)

.

p

p i|p >

the rst term on the r.h.s. of eq. (11), after insertion of
eq. (7) in the x-representation and integration in the u

2

variable, gives the one loop contribution to the eective

potential, u1() = r d4xr d4p
(11) can be computed by commuting a1
applying the relation

the second and the third term on the r.h.s. of eq.
p with bp and

(2)4 lnhp2 + u (2)((x))i.

h p, f ( (x))i = i



 x

f ( (x)).

(12)

inserting again eq. (7) in the x-representation and inte-
grating in the u variable, we nally get the coecient of
(x)(x), i.e. the one loop contribution z1((x))
to z((x)). this result coincides, as it should, with the
results of [9] and [7].

now we want to apply this method to the derivation

of the ow equations for uk and zk.

let sk[] be the wilsonian eective action at the scale
k. at an innitesimal lower scale k  k the eective
action skk[] is given by
eskk[] = r [d]esk[+] = esk[] 
r [d]e(cid:16)r d4x

(x)(y) (x)(y)(cid:17). (13)

2 r d4xd4y

sk []
(x) (x)+ 1

2 sk []

in eq.(13) we have written (x) = (x) + (x), sepa-
rating the component (x) with modes form zero up to
k  k, from (x), the component with modes within the
shell [k  k, k]. we have also assumed that the expan-
sion around the background eld (x) is saturated by
the trivial saddle point  = 0. in [10] the spontaneously
broken symmetry case, where non trivial saddle points
appear, is treated. here we limit ourselves to consider
the unbroken case. in addition we have kept only terms
up to o(2) as in the innitesimal shell limit (k  0)
the gaussian approximation is exact [2].

lets call f the subspace of functions with modes
(x) =

within the shell,

i.e. f = n(x)

pp  peipx ,

|p|  [k  k, k]o. the tilde over the mo-

mentum p is used from now on to indicate that |p| 
[k  k, k].

by the help of the dirac-like notation previously intro-

duced we can write :

(x) (x) =< s(1)

k | >

r d4x sk[]
r d4xd4y 2sk[]

(x)(y) (x)(y) =< | s(2)

k | > .

(14)

eqs. (14) dene the vector < s(1)
k | and the operator s(2)
whose entries in the x-representation are respectively
2sk[]
sk[]
(x) and
(x)(y) . by the help of eqs.(14), eq.(13)
can be written in the compact form :

k

eskk[] = esk[]z [d] e<s(1)

similarly for < | s(2)

(16)

the operator s(2)

few comments are in order.
it is clear that the trace
has to be taken in the subspace f , and this has been
indicated by the label  in t r. moreover s(2)
in eq.(16)
dened in (14) but rather its
is not
restriction to the subspace f . this point has been over-
looked in the previous literature [11,12,5] and eq. (16)
has always been written as if s(2)
ap-
peared in it. this illegal replacement is at the origin of
the incorrect result of [5].

rather then s(2)

it is easy to write down s(2)
onto f is p = p p |p >< p| and s(2)

as for the eective action () in eq.(1), we write
down now the gradient expansion for the wilsonian action
sk up to the lowest order derivative term, i.e.

k . the projection operator

k = p s(2)

zk() i.

sk[] = z d4xhuk() +
from eq.(16) we obtain then ukk and zkk and
nally, sending k  0, the ow equations for uk and
zk. it is not dicult to show (details will be presented in
[13] ) that with the ansatz (17) < s(1)
k >= 0.
then in eq. (16) we are only left with the computation
of t rln s(2)
k .

k |(cid:2) s(2)

k (cid:3)1

|s(1)

to illustrate the procedure and make our point clear,
it will be sucient to work with a eld independent zk
term. for the complete treatment we only need to follow
similar steps starting with a eld dependent zk.

writing the logarithm of the operator as in eq.(8), we

have :

t rln s(2)

k = z 

0

du t r hp(cid:0)zk p 2 + u (2)

k + u(cid:1)pi1

,

and expanding as in eq.(11) :

t rln s(2)

k = r 

0 dupp < p|h a1
b p a1

b p a1
p

+ a1
p

p + a1
p i|p >,

p

b p a1
p

(18)

(19)

where ap = p app and b p = p b pp.
it is clear that in eq.(19) only the rst term gives contri-
bution. in fact as b p = zkp p(p2  p2)|p >< p| and
both p and p belong to the shell [k  k, k], the operator
b p is o(k). from the sum over p in the shell comes
another o(k) and then in eq. (19) all the terms apart
from the rst have to be ignored being at least o(k2).

we are already in the position to compare our result
with those of [5]. from eqs.(7), (8) and (9) of that pa-
per we see that the operators in the full space, i.e. ap
and b p, and not their restriction to the f subspace are
considered. if we now replace in our eq.(19) the opera-
tors ap and b p with ap and b p respectively, we pick up
additional contributions from the second and third term
of eq.(19). performing for instance such a replacement
in the second term, by the help of eqs.(6) and (7) we get
immediately (a p(x) = zk p2 + u (2)
v r d4 p
(2)4 r d4x < p|x >< x| a1
 zkr d4 p

(2)4 r d4x ei px

a p(x) ( + p2) ei px

k ((x)) + u) :

p |p >=

b p a1

(20)

a p(x)

p

from eq.(20) we can easily see where the mistake orig-
inates. the operator  acting on
zk p2+u (2)((x))+u
gives rise to three terms. one is proportional to p and
gives zero after the angular integration in the momentum
variable p. another is proportional to p2 and cancels
against the p2 term. finally a third term is

ei px

r d4 p
(2)4 r d4x

zk
zk p2+u (2)
k ((x))+u



1
zk p2+u (2)

k ((x))+u

(21)

this term is not zero and gives additional spurious con-
tributions to zkk.

lets now give a closer look to the rst term of eq.(19):

< p|hp(zk p2 + u (2)

k + u)pi1

xp

|p > .

(22)

in [5] this contribution is written as:

z

d4 p

(2)4 z d4x

1
zk p2 + u (2)

k ((x)) + u

(23)

again this would be right if we could ignore the presence
of the projection operator p in eq.(22). as p|p >=
|p >, this would amount to replace the inverse a1
p in
f of the restricted operator ap with the restriction in
f of the inverse operator, p a1
p p . this replacement
would be correct if the operator ap was diagonal in the
p-representation. as we see from its denition, this is
certainly not the case.

actually the projection operator in eq.(22) is not easy
k ( (x)) +
[p(zk p2 +
k (0) + u)p]1, obtained expanding (x) around the

to handle unless we develop [p(zk p2 + u (2)
u)p]1 around the diagonal operator

constant value 0 (u (n)

(0) = u (n)

k0 ):

k

u (2)
k () = u (2)

k0 + u (3)

k0  +

1
2

u (4)

k0  +    .

(24)

if we now insert eq.(24) in eq.(22) and then integrate
in the u variable, we get the same result we would have

3

obtained if we had started by expanding the logarithm
in the uctuation determinant of eq. (16) around

ln[p(zk p 2 + u (2)

k0 )p]

(25)

i.e. as if we had used from the very beginning the expan-
sion of [7].

we can now come to our reassuring conclusion. there
is no contradiction between the two methods of [6] and
[7] that, when applied to the uctuation determinant in
eq.(16), give one and the same result for zkk, i.e. the
same ow equation for zk. we have also learnt that,
due to the constraint imposed by the presence of the
projection operator p the method of [6] trivially turns to
the method of [7].

i give now the couple of dierential equations for uk
and zk that are obtained once the full  dependence of
zk is taken into account (a = zkk2 +u (2)
k , a(n)
are derivatives w.r. to the eld):

[14] additional terms non analytic in q2 are found but, for
the rst time, the method allowed to compare the mag-
nitude of these terms with the ones that are retained in
establishing equation (27). in this way it was possible to
nd the conditions under which these terms can be safely
neglected, i.e. the validity conditions of eq.(27). but at
that time it was not yet clear that the result of [5] was
incorrect, i.e. if eq.(27) or the corresponding eq.(18) of
[5] was the correct one. actually in [15] we incorrectly
argued that both equations could be right as being dier-
ent approximations for dierent physical situations. only
now it appears clearly that the system of eqs.(26) and
(27) is the next order of approximation to the wegner-
houghton equation in the gradient expansion, after the
lpa of [3,4].

in a forthcoming paper [13] i will present a complete
analysis of the problems related to the presence of a sharp
cut-o. it is sucient to say here that the conclusions of
this work, more general than that of [15] as no reference
to a specic background eld is done, actually meet in
this respect those of [15]: for a suciently smooth back-
ground eld, these additional terms can be neglected and
eqs.(26) and (27) give the correct approximation to the
wegner-houghton equation at this order.

these equations have already been presented in [14,15]
and similar equations in [11,12], but a word of caution
has to be said concerning their derivation.
in [11,12]
where to derive the ow equations the method of [7] was
applied, the presence of the projection operator p was
not taken into account.
in addition there is one point
that i have deliberately avoided to mention up to now.
the presence of the projection operator p, that is due
to the choice of a sharp cut-o for the mode elimination,
has another eect: it potentially brings additional terms
in the derivation of zkk from eq.(16). again due to
the neglect of p, these terms went unnoticed in [11,12].
these derivations are then not on a rm foot.
in [14]
eq.(27) is obtained by considering the uctuation opera-
tor directly in the p-representation. no ambiguity is then
present concerning the restriction of the operator s(2)
k .
nevertheless the method employed, namely the choice of
a particular background eld (x), carries ambiguities
due to the appearance of these additional non-analytic
terms [16] in contradiction with the gradient expansion
itself. those terms are there neglected without any jus-
tication and the whole method seems not to be rmly
established.

in [15] the rst step beyond the lpa is taken by brute
force integration in the space of the fourier components
of the uctuation eld, i.e. without any reference to the
functional methods of [6] and [7]. again a special non
constant background eld is chosen to extract the dier-
ential equation for zk, namely a eld with a single fourier
component (x)  [qeiqx + qeiqx], with q  0. as in
