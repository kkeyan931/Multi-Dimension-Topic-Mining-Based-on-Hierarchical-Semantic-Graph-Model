abstract

the response of an integrable qft under variation of the unruh tempera-
ture has recently been shown to be computable from an s-matrix preserving
(replica) deformation of the form factor approach. we show that replica-
deformed form factors of the su(2)-invariant thirring model can be found
among the solutions of the rational sl2-type quantum knizhnik-zamolodchikov
equation at generic level. we show that modulo conserved charge solutions
the deformed form factors are in one-to-one correspondence to the ones at
level zero and use this to conjecture the deformed form factors of the noether
current in our model.

1 introduction

the form factor approach to massive integrable quantum eld theories (qfts) [9, 20]
provides a powerful tool to compute exact matrix elements of local operators from the
knowledge of the (factorized) s-matrix. to be precise, a form factor in this context is the
matrix element of some local operator between the physical vacuum and a multi-particle
scattering state. these form factors contain all the information about the qft as the
wightman functions can in principle be (re-)constructed in terms of them by saturating
with a complete set of scattering states. alternatively each local operator can be set into
correspondence to a sequence of form factors; a feature that has been used to classify the
full content of local operators in certain models, see e.g. [22, 19].
for an integrable qft the form factors can be characterized axiomatically as tensor-
valued meromorphic functions obeying a recursive set of functional equations, the so
called form factor equations [20].
as this will be of importance later we anticipate that one of these equations (the cyclic
form factor equation), see equation (8) below, is closely related to the bisignano-wich-
mann-unruh thermalization phenomenon [1, 26]. in particular the cyclicity parameter
 = 2 is both physically and mathematically linked to the unruh temperature tu = 1/2
(in natural units), seemingly of a very dierent origin. this connection that has been used
to formulate the cyclic form factor equation without reference to bootstrap analyticity
properties and to generalize it to non-integrable qfts [16].
among the most prominent non-scalar massive integrable models which have been solved
by the form factor method at tu = 1/2 are the sine-gordon model and the su(2)-
invariant thirring model [20, 21]. we will refer to the latter, which will concern us in
this paper, simply as the thirring model (even though this clashes a bit with standard
usage).

on the other hand, in an a priori independent direction of research it was shown in a
pioneering work [4] that the classical knizhnik-zamolodchikov dierential equation (for a
survey see [3]) which arises in conformal eld theory admits a quantum deformation. this
deformation amounts in a consistent system of holonomic dierence equation for a tensor
valued meromorphic function, which is referred to as deformed or quantum knizhnik-
zamolodchikov (qkz) equation. the authors of [4] already realised that a subset of the
standard form factor equations [20] provide a very specic example of a qkz equation.
much work has been done during recent years, to elaborate this connection, see [7, 13, 11]
and references therein.

1

in the seminal paper [24] the complete set of solutions of the qkz equation for a rational
sl2-type r-matrix has been found.
in this case one considers a function (z1, . . . , zn)
taking values in a tensor product of sl2-modules v1  . . . vn, and subject to a system of
dierence equations with shift parameter p

(z1, . . . , zm + p, . . . , zn) = rm,m1(zm  zm1 + p)    rm,m1(zm  z1 + p)
 rm,m1(zm  zn)    rm,m+1(zm  z1)(z1, . . . , zm, . . . , zn).

(1)

here, ri,j(z)  end(vi  vj) is the rational sl2 r-matrix. the more general case of this
equation involving an extra parameter  as studied in [24] will not be of importance in
this paper.
in a nut-shell the solutions of (1) are found as generalised hypergeometric integrals. sub-
sequently, the construction of [24] has been applied to irreducible representations of sl2 in
[12]. it is this case which is relevant here and which will provide our main mathematical
tool.

returning to form factors, it has been shown in [13] that smirnovs solutions of the form
factor equations in the thirring model [20, 21] can indeed be extracted from the general
solutions of (1). in particular, smirnovs results follow if we take only two-dimensional
fundamental representations v of sl2 (obviously corresponding to the physical states in
the model) and set p = 2i. this particular choice is referred to as level zero solution of
the qkz equation. in other words, the form factors of the thirring model can be identied
with specic solutions of the qkz equation at level zero.

the physics problem we wish to solve is to construct the replica-deformedform factors
in the sense of [14] for the su(2)-invariant massive thirring model.
we shall review some aspects of the replica-deformation in section 2. here it may be suf-
cient to remark that in view of the aforementioned relation to the bisignano-wichmann-
unruh thermalization, taking p 6= 2i in the qkz equations amounts to studying the
continuation of the original qft to some o-critical unruh temperature. the quest
for such a continuation naturally arises in the broader context of quantum gravity, see
e.g. [2, 5], in particularone is interested in the response of a qft under an innitesimal
variation of the unruh temperature. of course the problem in the rst place consists in
dening the continuation of the qft in question. for the partition function callan and
wilczek [2] proposed a replica prescription to dene its continuation. in [14] more gener-
ally the invariance of the s-matrix has been proposed as the dening criterion. specically
for an integrable qft this criterion turned out to uniquely determine the proper defor-
mation of the form factor equations. in particular there is still a cyclic equation whose

2

cyclicity parameter p 6= 2i physically correponds to an o-critical unruh temperature
and which is equivalent to the qkz equation at generic (non-zero) level. the main dier-
ence to the ordinary form factor equations lies in the residue equations which prescribe
how solutions with dierent number of variables are arranged into sequences. for models
with a diagonal s-matrix the qkz is easy to implement and some replica-deformed form
factors have been computed in [14, 18]. however, the full set has not yet been found for
any model.

as it was mentioned above the standard form factors of the thirring model can be found
among the solutions of (1) at level zero. it will be the key point of this paper to show
that the physical problem of construction the replica relatives of them can be solved by
means of the solutions of (1) at generic level. to be a bit more precise we have to arrange
solutions of (1) in sequences such that functions (z1, . . . , zn) with dierent numbers of
arguments are linked by the form factor equations to be described in section 2.
in particular if the local operator whose form factors are being considered has isospin
j then in group theoreticalterms its n-particle form factor is an intertwiner v n
1/2  vj,
where vj is the irreducible sl2-module of isospin j. in other words one has a one-to-one
correspondence

local operator of isospin j
in su(2) thirring model 

(2)

sequence of level zero qkz solutions

intertwining v n  vj, n  n0

here n0 is the starting member of a sequence and the non-vanishing members of a sequence
have all either n odd or n even. for simplicity we shall refer to such a sequence as an
isospin j sequence. the aim in the bulk of the paper is to achieve something similar
for the replica-deformed form factors. since the replica-deformed system is no longer an
ordinary poincare invariant qft, the bootstrap viewpoint becomes even more important.
that is the collection of deformed form factors is supposed to dene the replica deformed
system.
our main result can then be summarized as follows: the right hand side of the corre-
spondence (2) admits a unique replica-deformation, provided on both sides the equiva-
lence classes modulo pointwise multiplication with a conserved charge eigenvalue (i.e. a
regular solution of the form factor equations with trivial s-matrix) are being considered.
symbolically we can write

sequence of level zero

qkz solutions of isospin j

modulo conserved charge eigenvalue 

sequence of level p  2i 6= 0
qkz solutions of isospin j

modulo conserved charge eigenvalue

(3)

the structure of the conserved charge eigenvalues in both cases is very dierent and so
is the kinematical arena [14]. however, in view of (3) the structure of the state space in
both theories is very similar as will be shown in section 5, much in the spirit of the replica
idea [2, 14].

the outline of the paper is as follows. in the next section we briey review the replica-
deformation of massive integrable eld theories and describe the deformed form factor
equations. in section 3 we summarise the essentials of the bootstrap description of the
thirring model and prepare the deformed minimal form factors [18].
in section 4 we
rewrite the solutions of the rational sl2-type qkz-equation of [24, 12] in a way that facilates
the comparison with the (undeformed) form factors of the thirring model. it turns out
that the solutions can be parameterised by a polynomial similar to smirnovs form factors.
we proceed by generalising the completeness proof of the level zero solutions [23] to generic
level. it is essentially this completeness result that underlies the correspondence (3). in
section 6 we give the result for the deformed form factors and rst show that they satisfy
a subset of the modied form factor equations of [14]. here we take advantage of the
fact that the replica deformation leaves the bootstrap s-matrix, and hence the structure
of the algebraic algebraic bethe vectors, unaected. then we derive conditions on the
polynomial entering the qkz-solutions under which the corresponding form factors in
addition satisfy the modied kinematical residue equations. finally, using (2) and (3)
we give explicit expressions of some form factors which we conjecture to be the replica-
deformed form factors of the noether current in the su(2) thirring model. the last
section is left to a discussion of the results.

2 replica deformation of the form factor approach

in this section we review the results of [14, 15, 16] and state the modied form factor equa-
tions. the starting point is the bisignano-wichmann-unruh thermalisation phenomenon
stating that the vacuum of a minkowski space qft looks like a thermal state of inverse
temperature  = 2 with respect to the killing time of the rindler wedge [1, 26]. this
fact can be encoded symbolically in the following formula, where oi(xi), i = 1, . . . , n
denotes some local operator with support inside the rindler wedge w

h0|o1(x1)   on(xn)|0i = tr [exp(2k)o1(x1)   on(xn)] .

(4)

4

here k stands for the generator of lorentz boosts in w . note that this trace can  in
contrast to lattice models  never exist in a continuum qft due to the noncompactness
of k as described in [14, 16]. we therefore take (4) only as a mnemonic.
suppose now that we want to study the same qft with the parameter  shifted away
from 2, a problem which naturally arises in the broader context of quantum gravity, see
e.g. [2, 5]. formally this amounts to replace

exp(2k)  (exp(2k))/2 = exp(k),

(5)

in (4) while keeping everything else xed. in the case of an integrable qft we can require
specically that the factorized s-matrix of the model is unchanged upon (5). this can
be viewed as a concrete realisation of the replica idea of callan and wilczek [2]. in
particular, if one could make sense out of the deformed correlator (4), (5), its response
under an innitesimal variation of the unruh temperature could be obtained simply by
dierentiation






tr [exp(2k)o1(x1)   on(xn)](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=2

.

(6)

the response (6) again has a meaning within the context of qfts, while the deformed
correlators themselves no longer correspond to a relativistic qft.
the crux of the problem of course is to dene the deformed correlators consistent with the
replica idea (5) and in a way that avoids mathematical ambiguities. for example naively
regularizing the trace in (4) would most likely lead to enormous technical problems with
renormalizability since the translation invariance of the original qft is lost for  6= 2.
the solution proposed in [14] is to implement the replica idea on the level of form factors.
a form factor in this context is the matrix element of a local operator o(x) between the
vacuum and an n-particle scattering state. the scattering states depend on rapidities
zi and are created from the vacuum by means of faddev-zamolodchikov-type operators
aai(zi), where the index ai refers to the charge of a state. the form factor is then

fa1...an(z1, . . . , zn) = h0|o(x)|z1, . . . , znia1...an  trhe2ko(x)aa1(z1)    aan(zn)i ,

(7)

where we are again using our trace-mnemonic (4). in essence (7) says that a form factor
always looks like a trace, a fact that has been derived from general quantum eld the-
oretical principles and linked to the thermalisation phenomenon (4) in [16]. evidently
the replica idea (5) can be applied to (7) as well, and here it can be made operational.
this is because for the replica deformed form factors a modied system of form factor

5

equations exists. it is uniquely determined by (5) and the requirement that the s-matrix
in unaected by the deformation. for xed n the rst two equations are as follows [14].

fa1,a2...an(z1 + i, z2, . . . , zn) =  fa2...an,a1(z2, . . . , zn, z1),
n1a

n
an1an (zn1  zn)fa1,...,a
fa1,...an,an1(z1, . . . , zn, zn1) = s

n1a

n(z1, . . . , zn1, zn).

(8)

here scd
ab(z) is the factorised scattering operator. if this scattering operator has something
to do with an r-matrix, it is not dicult to see that these two equations are equivalent to
a qkz equation (1) at generic level if we identify p and  in an obvious way. for  = 2
we recover the level zero situation or the standard watson equations for form factors [20].
the parameter  is a phase, which may be dierent from  = 1 for certain local operators
of the model, see [20, 21].
we need to supply the equations (8) with one more set of conditions. these conditions
serve to single out those solutions of the qkz equation which are of physical importance
and provide a recursive relation between from factors involving dierent numbers of par-
ticles in the scattering state. we will refer to these additional conditions as kinematical
residue equations.
we note that due to the rst two requirements on the form factor (8) we may formulate
without loss of generality the recursive relations just in the variables zn1 and zn.
the particular solutions of (8) searched for are according to [14] supposed to have simple
poles at zn  zn1 = i mod i. the residues at these poles are determined by the
follwing equations which link solutions of (8) with n and n  2 variables.

zn=zn1+i

fa1,...an1,an(z1, . . . , zn1, zn) = canan1fa1,...an2(z1, . . . , zn2).

res
c an1anfa1,...an1,an(z1, . . . , zn1, zn) = fa1,...an2(z1, . . . , zn2).

res

zn=zn1i

(9)

here cab is the charge conjugation matrix and  is a numerical constant to be specied
later. note that the residue equation for zn = zn1 +i is similar to the condition satised
by traces of vertex operators in lattice models [7, 8]. without the second equation (9)
however the recursion n  2  n would be highly ambiguous. taking advantage of the
qkz equation to implement the analytic continuation zn  zn + i the second equation
(9) can be rewritten as follows

reszn=zn1i+i f (n)

a1...an(z1, . . . , zn1, zn) = f (n2)

 cancsc b1

c1a1(zn1  z1)    scn1bn2

an1an2(zn1  zn2).

b1...bn2(z1, . . . , zn2)

(10)

this form turns out to be more convenient later. observe that (10) looks like the second
term in the ordinary  = 2 residue equation. for   2 the poles at zn = zn1 + i
and zn = zn1  i + i merge and the residues add up, so that the ordinary residue
equation of [20] is recovered.
equations (8) and (9) are the replica deformed form factor equations. as explained
in the introduction for a given s-matrix we take their solutions to dene the replica
deformed system. the variation of of  away from 2 then has wide ranging physical
consequences. first of all the standard translation invariance is broken while lorentz
symmetry is maintained. quite generally the kinematical properties of the  6= 2 models
are drastically changed. for example it has been shown in [14] that the mass eigenvalues of
asymptotic states are altered in a way such that it costs more energy to boost two particles
relative to each other than in the  = 2 case. moreover, under certain circumstances
not the entire momentum phase space is accessible to the particles. this phenomenon is
close in spirit to t hoofts picture of scattering states subject to quantum gravitational
transmutation [6].

3 the su (2)-invariant thirring model

the aim in the rest of the paper is to study the replica-deformation of the 1+1-dimensional
su(2)-thirring model in terms of its form factors. in this section we prepare the basic
ingredients for its bootstrap description. for the sake of orientation however let us also
display the classical lagrangian. it is given in terms of a two-component spinor , valued
in the fundamental representation of su(2).

l = i   g( a)( a) .

(11)

here a are the pauli matrices. the model exhibits dynamical mass generation and is
believed to be asymptotically free. the physical particles of the theory are an su(2)
doublet of massive kinks. the index   {} refers to either of these kinks.
moreover it is known that the model is integrable, and the factorised s-matrix is given as
a function of the kink-rapidity z by the following expression.

s

12 (z) = s0(z)
2

z

2 + h 
z + h

,

h = i.

(12)

7

we use the abbreviation h = i as indicated in (12) from now on whenever suitable in
accordance with [13]. the scalar part s0 of the s-matrix is given by

s0(z) =

.

(13)

(cid:16) 1
2  z
(cid:16) 1
2 + z

2h(cid:17) (cid:16) z
2h(cid:17)
2h(cid:17) (cid:16) z
2h(cid:17)

without s0 the expression in (12) coincides with the rational sl2-r-matrix in the dening
representation [24, 12].
we also note that the charge conjugation matrix which enters the form factor equations
(9) and (10) is given as follows.

a = pn

c = i2.

(14)

the ordinary form factors associated with this s-matrix can be found in [20]. they have
two features one expects to be present also in the deformed case. first the tensor structure
and second the appearence of a product of so-called minimal form factors in the solutions.
concerning the tensor structure we recall that an n-particle form factor (7) can be indexed
by the kinks and anti-kinks of the scattering state and hence takes values in an n-fold
tensor product v n of fundamental representations of su(2). using the pauli matrices

i=1 a

i we can then dene the weight subspaces

(v n)l = {v  v n|3v = (n  2l)v}.

(15)

we restict our attention to solutions (z1, . . . , zn) of the qkz equation valued in the
space of singular vectors in (v n)sing
, i.e. to those satisfying +(z1, . . . , zn) = 0. this
is realted to an unbroken su(2)-symmetry. then 2l  n and all other components in an
irreducible su(2)-multiplet of isospin j = n/2  l can be obtained by acting with  on
the singular vector.

l

to make the notation comparable to [13, 12] we map the indices a1, . . . , an of the form
factor (7) to a set m as follows. let m = {m1 < m2 < . . . < ml}  {1, 2, . . . , n},
such that the number of elements of m is #m = l. in other words this set labels the
positions at which the form factor (7) has kinks of type  in the scattering state,
i.e. m = {i|i = }. hence, we can identify vectors in v n as

vm := v1  . . .  vn.

(16)

naturally we shall employ the weight decomposition (15) and the labelling (16) also in
the deformed case.

8

further we prepare here the deformed counterpart of the minimal form factor. this is
(up to factors coming from representation theory and the pole structure) the two particle
form factor as explained in [18]. the deformed minimal form factor f (z) is a solution of
the functional equations

f (z) = s0(z)f (z),

f (z + i) = f (z).

(17)

the solution to these equations were found in [18] in terms of barnes digamma functions.
let complex numbers 1, 2 be such that re i > 0 for i = 1, 2. we dene the digamma
function [8, 18] by the hankel contour integral as

log 2(x|1, 2) =

1

2i z exp(xt)(log(t) + )
q2
i=1(1  exp(it))

dt
t

,

(18)

where  denotes the euler constant. note that the periods 1, 2 enter symmetrically in
(18). the barnes periodicity of this function is due to the relation

where 1 can be identied with the usual  function as

2(x + 1|1, 2)

=

2(x|1, 2)

1

,

1(x|2)

1(x|2) = 1/2+x/2
the relevant solutions of (17) are then given by

2

(x/2)/2.

(19)

(20)

(21)

.

f (z) =

2(  iz|2, )2( +  + iz|2, )

2(iz|2, )2( + iz|2, )

note that apart from the higher periodicity the structure of (21) is similar to the one of
the scalar s-matrix (13). this feature was observed to be common for a large class of
integrable eld theories in [18]. the minimal form factor (21) was given an interpretation
in terms of central extensions of yangian doubles in [10]. as remarked before we can
identify the inverse unruh temperature  with the shift parameter p of the qkz equation
(1) via

we nd it convenient to use either of the variables throughout the paper, keeping the
above identication in mind. for  = 2 one recovers using (18) from (21) up to trivial
factors the minimal form factor (z) used by smirnov in [20, 21].

p = i.

(22)

9

for later use we conclude this section with the following identities among the minimal
form factors

f (z)f (z  h) =

f (z)f (z + h + i) =

1

1(iz|)1(   + iz|)

s0(z)

1(iz|)1(    iz|)

.

4 solutions of the rational qkz equation

it was mentioned in the previous section that  up to the scalar factor  the s-matrix of
the thirring model is just the rational sl2-r-matrix in the dening representation. this
means that the rst two functional equations (8) to be satised by the form factor (7) can,
 up to scalar factors which turn out to be the minimal form factors  be identied with
the solutions of the qkz equations with rational r-matrix as given in [24, 12]. obviously
our case is particularly simple in this respect because we have to work with only one type
of representation of sl2.
below we rst recall the solutions of [24, 12] at arbitrary level and then proceed by
rewriting them in a form suitable for our purposes. the new form readily allows one to
make contact to the level zero solutions [20, 21, 13] in the limit p  2i, and secondly
allows for a transparent procedure to single out those qkz-solutions which in addition
satisfy the modied kinematical residue equations (9) and (10).

we start by dening the rational hypergeometric space of [24] which will carry the infor-
mation on the number and position of the kinks and anti-kinks of the form factor (7). this
space consists of rational functions with at most simple poles and a certain asymptotic
behaviour [24]. we dene

gm (t1, . . . , tl) =

l

ya=1

1

ta  zma   y1k<ma




let f = f (t1, . . . , tl) be a function. let  be an element of the symmetric group sl.
following [24, 12] we dene a special symmetrisation in that for a simple transposition
(a, a + 1)  sl we set

ta  zk  
ta  zk + 
 .

(24)

10

[f ](a,a+1)(t1, . . . , ta, ta+1, . . . , tl) := f (t1, . . . , ta+1, ta, . . . , tl)

.

(25)

using this symmetrisation one can now introduce the following basis in the rational hy-
pergeometric space.

ta  ta+1 + h
ta  ta+1  h

wm (t1, . . . , tl) = xsl

[gm (t1, . . . , tl)].

(26)

it is clear that in order to make our results comparable with [20, 21] we have to get rid
of the unusual symmetrisation occuring in (26).
an important object in the theory qkz equations is the phase function. this object
provides the link between the analytic structure of the solutions and the geometry of
local systems [24, 3]. in the conventions of [24] the phase function is given by:

(t1, . . . , tl; z1, . . . , zn) =

l

n

ya=1

yj=1

(ta  zj; ) y1a<bl

(ta  tb; h),

where

(27)

(28)

(x; ) :=

((x + )/p)
((x  )/p)

.

we refrain from describing the connection coecients arising from (27), details can be
found in [24].
the third and last entity to describe the solution spaces of the rational qkz-equation is
the trigonometric hypergeometric space fq. the functions in this space are of the form

p (1, . . . , l; 1, . . . , n)

l

n

ya=1

yj=1

exp(i(zj  ta)/p)
sin((ta  zj  )/p) y1a<bl

sin((ta  tb)/p)

sin((ta  tb  h)/p)

.

(29)

here we have set a = exp(2ita/p) and j = exp(2izj/p). p is a polynomial. it will
be shown in the next section that the completeness of the solutions is encoded into the
properties of p . moreover, the local operators in the model can be classied in terms of
this object.

we can now write down the space of solutions of the qkz equation for a function with
values in v n in terms of an integral representation. let w = wp be a function of the
space fq dened in (29). the integrand is given by

11

i( wm , wp ) = wm (t1, . . . , tl) (t1, . . . , tl)wp (t1, . . . , tl),

(30)

where we omitted the dependence of i( wm , wp ) on z1, . . . , zn. the solution of the equation
(1) with values in representations indicated in the previous section is then given by:

w (z1, . . . , zn) = x#m =lzc1   zcl

dt1    dtl i( wm , wp ) vm .

(31)

we specify the integration cycles cl below after having rewritten this solution in a more
convenient form. it has been shown in [24, 12] that w is a solution to the qkz equation.
we will indicate how to check this after having introduced a basis in the solution space
which is more appropriate to the aim of this paper. we stress again that the information
on the space of representations of sl2 is contained only in the function wm . physically
speaking this means that once we have xed the number of kinks and anti-kinks in the
candidate form factor, the only freedom of choice resides in the polynomial p .

eventually we are interested in constructing the form factors of the replica-deformed
su(2)-invariant thirring model. to this end it is useful to rewrite the solution spaces
(31) in a form which allows a direct comparison with the standard level zero form factors
as they have been given in [20, 21, 13].
in particular we need to get rid of the non-
standard symmetrising operation (25) for the rational weight function (26). however, the
alterations to be performed do not change (up to an overall normalisation) the solution
(31).
we replace some objects appearing in (31) as follows:

ta  zj  ta  zj + h,

a, j;

  h/2.

(32)

this replacement will be in eect from now on.
next, we replace a part of the phase function (27) which does depend only on dierences
of the variables t as follows.

1

(cid:17)   h  (ta  tb)

p

(cid:16) tatbh

p

! (ta  tb  h) sin


p

(ta  tb  h).

(33)

as it is implicit already in [13] we can use this to replace the non-standard symmetrisation
(25) by a standard one.

wm (t1, . . . , tl) := wm (t1, . . . , tl) y1a<bl

(ta  tb  h) = asym (gm (t1, . . . , tl)) ,

(34)

12

where

gm (t1, . . . , tl) = gm (t1, . . . , tl) y1a<bl

(ta  tb  h),

(35)

and asym denotes the standard antisymmetrisation with respect to the variables t1, . . . , tl.
this means that upon performing the steps outlined above, we can work with the same
rational weight function as in the level zero case [13]. the same feature has been used in
[11] for determinant formulas in the case of the trigonometric qkz equation.
as will be explained below, the natural consequence of this is that the (algebraic) bethe
vectors in the -deformed case will be the same as in the standard level zero case.
in addition we can also cancel the pure t-dependent part in the denominator of (29). this
has in particular the remarkable consequence that the space fq introduced in (29) almost
coincides with the corresponding space introduced in [13, 23] in the level zero case. we
shall exploit this fact below.

next we reorganise the remaining parts of the integrand in (31). this will be done in a
way to point out the similarity between (31) and trace formulas of vertex operators as
developed in [7, 8, 10]. to this end we rst dene the analogue of the phase function used
by smirnov [20, 21].

(y) :=  h/2 + y

p

!  p  3h/2  y

p

! exp(

i
p

y).

(36)

note that here we put in the exponential factor from (29) just as a matter of convenience.
then we dene an odd function necessary to guarantee the complete symmetry of the
integrand with respect to t.

(y) := 1
3p

 h + y

p !  h  y

p ! sin(


p

y).

for later use let us note the identity

(y)(y + h) =

(y + 3h/2)(y + h/2) sin 

exp(2i(y + h/2)/p)

p (y + h/2) sin 

p (y + 5h/2)

(37)

.

(38)

observe that this expression (up the the exponential factor) tends to the corresponding
identity for the phase functions in [20, 21] in the case   2.
having now collected all the data we can write down the solution of the qkz equation in
a new form, which is, however, up to a normalisation identical with (31). since now the

13

only degrees of freedom of the solution reside in the polynomial p of (29) we prefer to
label the solution by this object.

p (z1, . . . , zn) = x#m =lzc1   zcl

ya=1

yj=1

(ta  tb) dt1    dtl vm .

the singular hyperplanes of the integrand in (39) are

ta = zj  h/2 + z0p,
ta = zj + p  3h/2 + z0p,
depending
ta = zj  3h/2,
ta = tb  h + z0p,
ta = tb + h + z0p.

on m,

(40)

note that the comment in the third line means that this pole may occur only in the basis
function wm and hence its presence depends on the indexing set m.
this now allows us to specify the integration contours as follows. for any a = 1, . . . , l we
let the integration contour ca separate
i. the hyperplanes of the rst line from the ones of the second and third line in (40).
ii. the hyperplanes of the fourth line from the ones in the fth line of (40).

this choice is convenient for our purposes, but as it has been indicated in [24, 12] the
solution space is by analytical continuation actually independent of the particular choice
of the integration contour.
we are now going to check that (39) is a solution of the rational qkz-equation. of course
this is clear by construction [24]. however, along the way we introduce some new objects
which will be of importance later in the paper. the use of these objects is nicely illustrated
by verifying the qkz equations.
a fundamental role in [24] is played by discrete derivates with respect to the variables t
and z respectively. we describe these derivatives within the modied form of the solution
space (39). therefore we introduce shift operators:

zjf (t1, . . . , tl; z1, . . . , zn)

:= l+j(t, z) f (t1, . . . , tl; z1, . . . , zj + p, . . . , zn),

(41)

qaf (t1, . . . , tl; z1, . . . , zn)

:= a(t, z)f (t1, . . . , ta + p, . . . , tl; z1, . . . , zn),

14

where

l+j(t, z) =

a(t, z) =

ta  zj + 3h/2

,

(42)

are the connection coecients of [24, 12] adjusted to the choice of the solution (39).
with these objects we can dene discrete partial derivatives, using the convention that
da for a = 1, . . . , l acts on variable ta while dl+j for j = 1, . . . , n acts on variable zj.

da = 1  qa,

dl+j = 1  zj.

(43)

the proof that (39) is a solution of the rational qkz equation is then parallel to the one
given in [13] for the level zero case. we state the necessary steps here because we will
need this result later for the solution of the rst two form factor equations (8).
following (12) and (13) let r(z)

12 = s(z)
12s0(z)1, and f (a)
1,...,n for a = 1, . . . , l be a
2
2
family of functions which can be expressed in terms of the rational hypergeometric basis
functions (34). the qkz equation for functions of the form (39) valued in v n is then
equivalent to the following equations on the rational hypergeometric basis functions (34),
taking into account the denition of the set m at the end of section 3.
we state the rst one in z1 only, but its generality is obvious.

z1w1,2,...,n(; z1, z2, . . . , zn)  w2,...,n,1(; z2, . . . , zn, z1) =

the second equation refers to the exchange of two z variables

(45)

we then have the following

theorem 1: the function (39) valued in the tensor product v n is a solution of the
rational sl2 qkz-equation.

15

proof: for the proof it is sucient to recall that the hypergeometric integral of [24, 12] as
dened in (39) has exact hypergeometric forms (cf. [24] lemma 2.21), which are essentially
given by the derivatives da dened in (43).

5 completeness of the solutions

here we prove the completeness of the solutions (39) of the qkz equation. on the basis
of form factors in the sine-gordon model the completeness of the solutions was shown
by smirnov [22] in establishing a bilinear relation among the solutions of the form factor
space. later is was shown by tarasov [23] that (at least for the rational qkz equation)
similar relations can be extracted from the solution spaces of the qkz equation directly.
in [23] the fact was used that for the form of the qkz equation (1) studied in this paper,
there exist zero solutions. in our language this means that there exist polynomials p in
(39) such that the integral vanishes automatically. this guarantees that the dimension
of the solution space matches the dimension of (v n)sing rather than that of v n. for a
detailed presentation of this topic, see [24].
in this section we are going to derive a completeness relation for the solutions of the
qkz-equation at generic level, similar to the one in the level zero case [22, 23]. since we
modelled our solution parallel to the level zero case [13, 23] we can expect that the proofs
here will be quite similar to the ones given in [13, 23]. the main dierence is due to the
more complicated pole structure of the integrand (40).
we begin by noting the dimension of the space fq introduced in (29); it is nite dimen-
sional with dimfq = dim(v n)l = (cid:16)n
l(cid:17).

let us rst consider the case l = 1 in the integral (39), which means in particular that
there are no -functions present. insert for the polynomial p either of the two choices

exp


p

n

yj=1

ps1(t1) = e2ihn/p

(t1  zj + 3h/2),

(t1  zj + h/2).
(46)
if we ignore for the moment that the partial degree in exp(2it1/p) is not as it may have
been assumed in (29) it is not dicult to check that the rst expression cancels all possible
poles appearing in the second line of (40). closing the contour c1 in (39) such that it
encircles the poles in question, we realise that the integral vanishes.

or ps2(t1) =

exp

n

yj=1


p

16

the same kind of argument applies to the second choice in (46). here we close the contour
c1 such that it contains all possibles poles appearing in the rst line of (40).
hence we have established that for l = 1

ps1 = 0 = ps2.

this result is the generalisation of lemma 5.3 in [13] to the generic level case.

let us proceed to the case of l = 2. according to [23] we set

(1)(t) = ps1(t)  ps2(t).

(47)

(48)

from the partial degree point of view this is a proper candidate for the polynomial p . it
is clear from (47) that we also have

(1) = 0.

(49)

let us give an interpretation of this object. according to [24] it is possible to construct
basis functions similar to (34) for the trigonometric hypergeometric space as dened on
(29). if we take the denition (2.26) of [24] and rewrite the basis according to our form
of the solutions (39) of the qkz-equation, we nd that these basis functions for l = 1 and
variables z1, . . . , zn can be recast as a polynomial

p(t) = exp (4i(n  )/p) y1j<(cid:16)e2i(tzj +)/p  1(cid:17) y<jn(cid:16)e2i(tzj )/p  1(cid:17) .

(50)

note that we still keep the convention (32). we can formally extend the denition (50)
also to the case  = 0.
then it is straightforward to check that

n

yj=1(cid:16)e2i(tzj +)/p  1(cid:17) = p0(t) + (e4i/p  1)

pj(t).

n

xj=1

(51)

the trigonometric hypergeometric basis functions for l = 2 in their polynomial form (ap-
propriate to the conventions laid out in the previous section) can for  <  be constructed
from (50) as

p(t1, t2) =  sin

(t1  t2)!1


p

asym  p(t1)p(t2) sin


p

(t1  t2  h)! .

(52)

17

having seen the structure of the basis functions, we can now write down a polynomial
(2)

(2)(t1, t2) = (1)(t1)(1)(t2) sin

(t1  t2)!1 sin


p


p

(t1  t2  h)  sin


p

(t2  t1  h)! .

(53)
taking into account the pole structure (40) it is possible along the lines in the l = 1 case
to check that for l = 2 we have

(2) = 0.

(54)
the functions (1) and (2) are the analogs of the kernel functions at level zero as intro-
duced by tarasov in [23]. therefore the construction of the graded spaces in section 7 of
[23] can be applied to the case of generic level as well.
this means that we have now found the necessary set of kernel polynomials for the
solutions of the qkz-equation. the function (2) is the analog of what was found in [22]
as a consequence of the deformed riemann bilinear identity at level zero.
we say that the arguments z1, . . . , zn are in generic position, if the singular hyperlanes in
(40) do not coincide. for the case when they do, see section 6.
the main point now is that the kernel solutions (49) and (54) reduce the actual dimension
of the parameter space from dim(v n)l to dim(v n)sing
. this can be established using
arguments absolutely parallel to the ones employed in the proof of theorem 4.3 and 4.4
in [23]. this then gives rise to the following

l

theorem 2: for generic values of the arguments z1, . . . , zn, the solutions (39) span the
space (v n)sing

.

l

remark: this result is crucial for the correspondence (3) between the ordinary and the
deformed form factors. we shall return to it after theorem 4. but let us indicate here
that it means that the number of physical states in the replica-deformed model is identical
to the one in the standard case. a fact which, however, could have been anticipated.

6 the replica-deformed form factors

in this section we dene the replica-deformed form factors and check under which con-
ditions on the objects p they satisfy the modied form factor equations of section 2.

18

according to what has been said in section 3 we can encode the index structure of the
form factor (7) as

f1,...,n(z1, . . . , zn) = fm (z1, . . . , zn).

(55)

m (z1, . . . , zn) the summand corresponding to the basis element wm in the

we denote by i p
expression for the solution p of the qkz-equation, as stated in (39).
recall that the form factors of the standard thirring model [20, 21] are (cf. [13]) special
solutions of the rational sl2 qkz equation at level zero multiplied by a scalar function.
we will now show that the form factors in the replica-deformed thirring model in the
sense of [14] naturally arise from the solutions of the rational sl2 qkz equation at generic
level. specically we will show that for a suitable choice the objects p the functions

fm (z1, . . . , zn) =

cl

(2i)l yni>j1

f (zi  zj)  i p

m (z1, . . . , zn),

(56)

are solutions of the deformed form factor equations (8)(10). note that we take 2l  n,
later we shall see that j = n/2  l can be identied with the isospin of the underlying
local operator. for the constant cl we take:

cl = (cid:16)2h (3h/2)(h/p)()/eih/(2p)(cid:17)l

.

(57)

the fact that (56) is a solution to the rst two form factor equations (8) can be proved
without problems. due to its importance we state this fact as the following

theorem 3: the function fm (z1, . . . , zn) as dened in (56) satises the form factor
equations (8).

proof: take the identities (17) for the minimal form factor f (z) to realize that the

factor qni>j1 f (zi zj) saturates the scalar part of the s-matrix (12) in the form factor

equations (8). the theorem in section 4 together with (44) and (45) establishes the
result.

remark: if we stick to the denition of the form factor given in (56), which means that
we keep the the requirements set up earlier on the polynomial p in (29), then fm satises
(8) with  = 1. there are, however, situations where we have to weaken the requirements
on p depending on the local operator we are going to describe with this object. for
example in the next section we will see an example, where we relax the p-periodicity in
the variables z of p . in this case  may be dierent from unity but still satises || = 1.

19

we now come to the part in the form factor business going beond the qkz-equation.
namely, we have to single out those solutions described in theorem 3, which do satisfy
the equations (9) or (10).
our strategy to prove this will be similar to the one used by smirnov [20, 21]. in our case
this means the following. in [20, 21] the source for the poles zi = zj  h were taken to
reside entirely in the algebraic bethe vectors m . additional contributions arising from
the residue evaluation of the integrals (39) at level zero, the origin of which is the pinching
of integration contours, are removed by a trick.
the algebraic bethe vectors m were shown in [13] (lemma 6.4) to descend directly from
the rational basis functions wm . now we have seen that at generic level by (34) we can
work with the same basis functions as in the level zero case.
this essentially reects the replica-understanding of [2] in varying the unruh temperature
in an integrable qauntum eld theory as sketched in section 2. there we have seen that
this thermalisation changes many aspect of the physics but preserves the s-matrix of the
zero temperature model. and as the s-matrix is unchanged, the algebraic bethe ansatz
[21] remains, of course, unchanged. we could now outline along the lines of [13] how to
construct the bethe vectors from the the solution of the qkz-equation (39). however,
this is quite technical and in addition we would like to show that the kinematical residue
equations (9) and (10) can be solved using the basis functions wm directly and using the
singular hyperpalnes of the hypergeometric integral (40) only (mainly because the other
way is by smirnovs work very well understood).
for that purpose we simply state the now obvious but physically important

lemma 1: the replica deformation of the su(2)-invariant thirring model has no eect
on the algebraic bethe ansatz.

we can now proceed to nd solutions of the kinematical equations (9) and (10). we rst
collect some results on the residues of the functions wm (t1, . . . , tl; z1, . . . , zn) as dened in
(34) as they will be needed to evaluate some of the integrals i p
m below. for the proofs to
be given below it is sucient to consider only poles in the variables zn1 and zn. therefore
we prefer not to write down most of the formulas in the sequel in full generality, but rather
stick to the sucient case.
for both n  1, n /m or n  1, n  m we nd that

res

tl=zn3h/2

wm (t1, . . . , tl) = 0 =

res

tl=zn13h/2

wm (t1, . . . , tl).

(58)

the next case is when n  m but n  1 /m. we set n = m \ {n}.

(ta  zn1 + 3h/2),

(59)

wm (t1, ..., tl; z1, ..., zn)|zn=zn1+h = 0.

if we take the residue with respect to zn1 rather than zn, we get:

res

res

tl=zn3h/2

res

tl=zn13h/2

res

wm (t1, ..., tl; z1, ..., zn)|zn=zn1+h =

(60)
at last we treat the case of n /m but n  1  m. set n  = m \ {n  1}. here we nd
that restl=zn3h/2 wm (t1, . . . , tl) = 0, while

= 

res

wm (t1, ..., tl; z1, ..., zn)|zn=zn1h.

which is obviously independent of the pole structure.

lemma 2: the form factor (56) has a kr pole zn = zn1  h if n  1  m and n /m
and arises from the singular hyperplanes ta = zn1  3h/2.
the form factor (56) has a kr pole zn = zn1 + h if n  1 /m and n  m and arises
from the singular hyperplanes ta = zn  3h/2.
there are no kr poles if both n  1, n  m or n  1, n /m.
proof: in (40) we have collected the singular hyperplanes of the integral (39). we could
think of evaluating the integrals by means of the leray residue method. having done this
one realises that the source for poles of the kind zn = zn1  h or zn = zn1 + h can only
reside in expressions arising from the phase function (36). now a kinematical pole of the
rst type appears if we take ta = zn1  3h/2. this singularity shows up i it is present

21

in wm (34) and hence if n 1  m. we have to check that if this is the case the presence
of n in m leads to a vanishing contribution. this is easy to see because e.g.

the proof of the second statement is similar. the last statement is then a consequence
of (58) and the rst two statements in lemma 2.

restl=zn13h/2wm|zn=zn1h = 0.

(62)

we can now check under which conditions of p the form factor satises the kinematical
residue equations (9) and (10) in the thermalised case.
first of all it is clear from the proposition that if both n  1, n  m or n  1, n /m the
residue of fm at the points in question vanishes. this means that in this case fm satises
the equations (9) and (10) since the charge conjugation matrix c vanishes here.
next, we mention that due to (40) for the other cases discussed in the proposition, i.e.
(n1, n) = (, +) or = (+,) we do not encounter the pinching of integration contours
which occurs in the case of standard form factors in the model [21].
the verication of the residue equation (9) for zn = zn1h is more or less straightforward.
we use the proposition of this section and evaluate the multiple integral i p
m at tl =
zn1  3h/2. this pole is present for (n1, n) = (, +) and for (n1, n) = (+,).
then we take the residue of the remaining expression at the point in question and use
the identities (38) and (23).
let us state that we set  = 0 if (n1, n) = (, +) and  = 1 if (n1, n) = (+,), and
that we abbreviate the parameter p in (56) by pl,n. the result of the procedure outlined
before is then

to check the second type of kinematical poles at zn = zn1 + h, which is at least not
explicitly necessary in the level zero case, we take a dierent strategy. rather than to
take the residue directly at this point we perform an analytic continuation and evaluate
the residue at zn = zn1 + p  h. the fact that the corresponding residue equations are
equivalent is shown in cite [14]. in addition it may be nice to see how the s-matrix factors
in (10) come about.
we use the property (44) which was used in the construction of solutions of the qkz
equations in section 3. up to total derivatives we have

w1,...,n1,n(; z1, . . . , zn1, zn)  z1wn,1,...,n1(; zn, z1, . . . , zn1).

(65)

here z1 acts on the rst index n associated with the variable zn.
now we move zn back to the place n  1 using the r-matrix property of the rational
hypergeometric basis functions according to (45). hence we get up to total derivatives

we are going to discuss some important solutions of the equations (64) and (68) in the
following section.
obviously, the value of n/2 l an invariant under the kinematical residue equations. this
invariant can be interpreted as the isospin of form factor sequence. this means that by
(64) and (68) we get sequences of solutions of all form factor equations for each value of
the isospin.
let us collect the main results in a theorem.

theorem 4: there exist innite sequences

fm (z1, . . . , zn) =

cl

(2i)l yni>j1

f (zi  zj)  i pl,n

m (z1, . . . , zn),

(69)

of solutions of the qkz-equation with the r-matrix being the s-matrix (12) of the thirring
model. each sequence is labelled by the invariant n/2  l. if in addition pl,n satises the
recursion relations (64) and (68) then the members of each sequence are linked by (9) and
hence provide replica-deformed form factors of local operators in the thirring model with
isospin n/2  l.
of course every sequence (69) can be multiplied pointwise with a sequence q(z1, . . . , zn)
without changing the properties described, provided q(z1, . . . , zn) is completely symmetric
and i-periodic in all arguments, and satises

24

q(z1, . . . , zn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)zn=zn1i

= q(z1, . . . , zn2) .

(70)

alternatively such sequences arise as ambiguities in the solution of the recursive equations
for the polynomials pl,n. physically the solutions of (70) correspond to eigenvalues of a
local conserved charge. as shown in [14] the structure of these eigenvalues for  6= 2 is
quite dierent from that in the undeformed case. also the eigenvalues in both cases are
not automatically in one-to-one correspondence, though they can be made so by imposing
suitable minimality conditions.
in any case, modulo their respective ambiguities, the
completeness result for section 5 (together with its undeformed counterpart) now implies
the announced correspondece (3): the form factor sequences in the replica-deformed
model are essentially in one-to-one correspondence to their undeformed qft counterparts.
in particular this allows one to identify the replica copy of the form factors of a local
operators. as an illustration we present the replica-deformed form factors of the noether
current in the next section.

7 deformed form factors of the noether current

in this section we present solutions to the equations (64) and (68). as it was mentioned
in the introduction, the form factor approach enables to classify the full space of local
operators of a given model. this arises from the fact that there exist kernel solutions to the
equations (64) and (68). this feature is illustrated in [20] where the local elds in the sine-
gordon model have been counted, and in [19] where the full space of local operators
in the sinh-gordon model has been found.
in the latter model the local operators in
one superselection sector were identied with the integer powers of the elementary eld
appearing in the lagrangian together with an exponential eld.
it should be possible to mimic the analysis of the local elds of [22] in the present case as
well. however, we would like to present in this section solutions to (64) and (68) which in
the limit  = 2 turn into the form factors corresponding to the su(2) noether current
in the thirring model. these form factors are well understood in the standard case and
it has been shown in [13] how these form factors arise from the qkz-solutions at level
zero and how they come about from the trace formulae of vertex operators in the yangian
double of [10].

 be the noether current associatted with the lagrangian (11);  is the lorentz index
and a the su(2)-index as introduced in section 3. it is convenient to switch to lightcone
coordinates both in minkowski space and in internal space, i.e.

(71)
then we can introduce an index  = , 3 labelling the components of the lightcone
currents as j

comparing this with the level zero counterpart [21, 13] we nd that this choice of pl,n
corresponds to the form factors of the current j
 . the form factors of the other compo-
nents of j
 can obviously be obtained by applying the operator + once or twice to the
corresponding form factor.
a closer look on the solution (72) shows that the corresponding form factor does satisfy
the rst two of the form factor equations (8) with a factor  6= 1. but still we have || = 1
as it should be. the reasons why this feature appears is disussed in detail in [21].

 = 0.

of course, in order to establish that these solutions do really correspond to the replica-
deformed form factors of the currents we have to prove several conditions like in the level
zero case, see section 6 of [21]. the most important of these conditions is the current
conservation condition  ja
to verify this in the deformed framework involves the knowledge of the deformed eigen-
values of the lightcone momenta. we remind that the kinematics in the deformed model
is quite dierent from the usual model as was outlined in section 2. even though these
eigenvalues have been characterised and computed for some low values of the particle
number n in [14], a general formula is not known at present. this certainly deserves a
further study also in the light of the characterisation of other operators in the replica-copy
of the thirring model as well.
therefore, we can at present only conjecture that the form factors characterised by the
solutions (72) do correspond to the noether-current operators in the replica-copy of the

26

thirring model. nevertheless we can give an argument to support our conjecture. let p
be the eigenvalues of the lightcone momenta on an n-particle state in the  6= 2 copy of
the thirring model according to [14]. we denote by (z1, . . . , zn) the functions which
we conjecture to be the form factors of the currents j
 .
the explicit dierence of + and  resides rst in the purely z-dependent part of (72).
this bit is not aected by the integration. the second -dependent part comes from the
rst product term in (72). this term is trivial in the sense that it responsible neither
for poles nor for zeros of the integrand. in addition it is p-periodic. therefore it is clear
that there is a scalar function r(z1, . . . , zn) such that for any particle number we have
an identity + = r. according to what was said at the end of the previous section
we can now redene for any number of arguments n the form factors of the currents by
setting

then we can write the current conservation as follows:

j+ := p+r1/2+,

j := pr1/2.

which is zero due to the aforementioned identity.

p+j + pj+ = p+pr1/2 (+  r) ,

8 discussion

(74)

(75)

in this paper we have been trying to illustrate the natural connection between rational
solutions of the qkz equation and the replica-deformed form factors in the su(2)-invariant
thirring model. here we took up two independent directions of recent research.
the rst one is niedermaiers formalism showing that every integrable massive quantum
eld theory in 1 + 1-dimensions admits an s-matrix preserving deformation, which can be
interpreted as providing a replica-copy of the original qft with an o-critical unruh
temperature.
it was shown in [14] that this replica-copy can be described exactly in
terms of its form factors, the latter being solutions of a a modication of the standard
form factor equations [9, 20]. the present paper is the rst in which these equations have
been solved for a particular model in full generality.
as a technical tool we took advantage of another recent development, namely the study
of the solutions of the rational sl2 qkz equation [24, 12]. as one could suspect by looking

27

at the rst set of modied form factor equations (8), their solution in the thirring model
case should somehow reside in the space of solutions of the qkz-equation for a particular
representation of sl2. the question then is whether among these solutions we can nd
some satisfying the deformed kinematical residue equations (9) as well.
the main purpose of this work was to show that this is indeed possible. in outline we
rewrote the qkz-solutions of [24, 12] at generic level in a way faciliating the comparison
with the standard level zero situation. we argued that this form of the solution naturally
shares the property that the algebraic bethe vectors remain unchanged under the replica
thermalisation. this fact could have been expected since the modied form factor equa-
tions use the usual scattering matirx. we then supplemented our qkz-solutions with the
minimal form factor to dene an object (56) having only the polynomial p unspecied.
using the pole structure of the qkz-solutions we derived conditions on p from the modi-
ed kinematical residue equations and solved these conditions to conjecture the deformed
form factors of the noether-current in the su(2) thirring model.

to summarise we have shown that the unruh-thermalised form factors arise naturally
from qkz-solutions at generic level as the standard form factors do at level zero.
we may also anticipate thath the   0 limit of our construction bears an unexpected
relation to dimensionally reduced quantum gravity [17].

it should now be possible to derive integral representations of the form factors for the ther-
malised sine-gordon model using the results on trigonometric qkz-solutions as derived
in [25]. it would be particularly interesting to construct the thermalised form factors of
the breather sectors. this would involve also the construction of modied fusing relations
for the form factors. the latter havent been supplied in [14]. in addition solving this
problem would also naturally lead to an integral representation of the thermalised form
factors in the sinh-gordon model, a problem which has only partially been solved in [14].
