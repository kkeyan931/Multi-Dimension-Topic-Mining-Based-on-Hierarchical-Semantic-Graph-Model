abstract: a review of the applications of noncommutative geometry to a systematic formulation
of duality symmetries in string theory is presented. the spectral triples associated with a lattice
vertex operator algebra and the corresponding dirac-ramond operators are constructed and shown
to naturally incorporate target space and discrete worldsheet dualities as isometries of the noncom-
mutative space. the target space duality and dieomorphism symmetries are shown to act as gauge
transformations of the geometry. the connections with the noncommutative torus and matrix theory
compactications are also discussed.

1. introduction

string theory in the previous decade raised some
expectations about the nature of geometry at
very small distance scales. because strings have a
nite intrinsic length scale ls, it may not be pos-
sible to observe distances smaller than ls. thus
if one uses only strings as probes of short dis-
tance structure, the conventional ideas of general
relativity break down at lengths of the order of
ls. this is exemplied through string modied
uncertainty relations [1] which yield an absolute
lower bound on the measurability of lengths in
the spacetime. the spacetime coordinates thus
become smeared out and at short distances the
notion of a point becomes meaningless.

another piece of evidence is the t -duality
symmetry of strings compactied on a circle s1

based on talk given by the rst author at the 6th
hellenic school and workshop on elementary particle
physics, corfu, greece, september 626, 1998. to be
published in jhep proceedings.

of radius r [2]. this is a quantum symmetry
which maps the string theory onto one with tar-
get space the circle of dual radius r = l2
s/r, and
at the same time interchanges the momenta of
the strings with their winding numbers around
the s1 in the spectrum of the quantum string
theory. because of this symmetry, the moduli
space of string theories on s1 is parametrized by
radii r  ls, and very small circles are unobserv-
able since the corresponding string theory can
be mapped onto a completely equivalent one liv-
ing on a very large s1. this leads to the notion
of quantum geometry, dened to be the appro-
priate modication of classical general relativity
implied by string theory.

the uncertainty relations tell us that space-
time at very small distances should be thought
of as a quantum object. the appropriate math-
ematical arena for the study of such pointless
geometry is the theory of algebras started by von
neumann, which in more modern times has de-
veloped into noncommutative geometry [3]. non-

commutative geometry presents an alternative,
algebraic approach to the study of riemannian
geometry and its generalizations, such as those
hinted by string theory. in this paper we shall
discuss the applications of noncommutative ge-
ometry towards a systematic development of the
notion of quantum geometry.

despite the implications on short distance
structure presented by string theory, many ques-
tions have been answered using only classical ge-
ometry. this has occured in part because of the
extremely rich mathematical structures embed-
ded into string compactications which enables
one to develop to a great extent eective eld
theories on moduli spaces. however, the eec-
tive eld theories hide the true internal symme-
tries of string theory, and to study the internal
kaluza-klein spaces the notion of spacetime ge-
ometry needs a drastic modication. this has
become especially clear over the last few years
when it has been realized that the low energy
eective eld theory for d-branes in string the-
ory has conguration space which is described in
terms of non-commuting, matrix valued space-
time coordinate elds [4]. this has led to, among
other things, the matrix theory conjecture [5],
which proposes a light-cone frame description of
m-theory in terms of the hamiltonian dynamics
of d0-branes. this rich structure indicates that
some sort of generalization of geometry is needed
to describe the internal degrees of freedom im-
plied by d-branes and m-theory, and indeed it
has been shown recently that noncommutative
geometry is the natural setting in which to study
toroidal compactications of matrix theory [6].
in this paper we shall review the formulation
of quantum geometry through the techniques of
noncommutative geometry, based mostly on the
approach developed in [7][15] that constructs
a space in which string duality is naturally
realized as a true geometric symmetry. start-
ing from a brief review of the ideas from non-
commutative geometry that we shall need, we
shall describe the construction of the frohlich-
gawedzki geometry [7] which is based upon the
algebraic properties of vertex operator algebras.
we will then describe how string duality natu-
rally leads to the quantum geometry of classical
spacetimes within this framework, and how the

dualities manifest themselves as internal gauge
symmetries of the noncommutative geometry [9,
11, 12, 14]. this latter property is formalized by
a remarkable connection between string geome-
try and the noncommutative torus [13], which
also allows us to relate this worldsheet approach
to the target space descriptions using matrix the-
ory compactications.

2. spectral triples in noncommuta-

tive geometry

noncommutative geometry is the study of geo-
metric spaces (and their generalizations) using
algebras of elds dened on them. in this article
we shall discuss how to describe stringy space-
time as a noncommutative geometry, and how
the symmetries of the theory (such as t -duality
and spacetime dieomorphisms) are realized as
gauge transformations. the starting point is to
discuss an algebraic framework for ordinary com-
mutative geometry. usually a compact rieman-
nian manifold m is characterized as a topological
space on which locally it is possible to introduce
points x  m characterized by a nite number
of real numbers xi  r. distances in m are de-
termined by the metric of the space,

ds2 = gij(x) dxi dxj

(2.1)

via the formula for geodesic length

d(x, y) = inf

x,y rx,y

ds

(2.2)

where x,y is a path from the point x to the point
y in m .

there is a dual description of the topology
and dierentiable structure of a smooth man-
ifold which is provided by the -algebra a =
c(m, c) of smooth complex-valued functions
f : m  c (this algebra can be thought of
as the algebra generated by the points of m ).
the completion of this algebra is the commuta-
tive c-algebra c0(m, c) of continuous complex-
valued functions on m with the l-norm

kf k = sup
xm

|f (x)|

(2.3)

the algebra c0(m, c) encodes all of the infor-
mation about the topology of the space through

2

noncommutative geometry and string duality

f. lizzia and r.j. szabob

the continuity criterion. thus, in general, given
a topological space one may naturally associate
to it an abelian c-algebra. that the converse
is also true is known as the gelfand-naimark
theorem [16]. namely, there is an isomorphism
between the category of hausdor topological
spaces m and the category of commutative c-
algebras a. the gelfand-naimark functor is
constructed by using the fact that given an abelian
c-algebra a, it is possible to reconstruct a topo-
logical space m as the structure space of charac-
ters of the algebra, i.e. the -linear multiplicative
functionals  : a  c. points x  m are then
obtained via the identication

x(f ) = f (x)

,

f  a

(2.4)

and the topology is obtained in an unambiguous
way from the notion of pointwise convergence (in
the usual topology of c). note that for a com-
mutative algebra a character is the same thing as
an irreducible representation of a.

what this all means is that the study of the
properties of topological spaces can be substi-
tuted by a purely algebraic description in terms
of abelian c-algebras. a noncommutative space
is then obtained by replacing c0(m, c) by some
non-abelian c-algebra. in that case, not all ir-
reducible representations of the algebra are one-
dimensional and the identication of points be-
comes ambiguous. but as we shall see, the purely
algebraic approach of noncommutative geometry
is particularly well-suited to describe the intrin-
sic symmetries of string theory. note that the
-algebra c(m, c) also encodes all of the in-
formation about the dierentiable structure of a
manifold m through the smoothness criterion. in
what follows it will suce to have a description
in terms of only a dense subalgebra of a given
c-algebra.

the metric aspect and other geometrical prop-

erties are introduced into this framework by us-
ing the fact that any c-algebra can be repre-
sented faithfully and unitarily as a subalgebra of
the algebra b(h) of bounded operators acting on
some separable hilbert space h [16]. in the fol-
lowing often we will not distinguish between the
abstract algebra a and its representation (a)
(the norm on a is thus always understood as the
operator norm and the -involution as hermitian

3

conjugation). an innitesimal length element
is introduced by the relation

ds1 = d

(2.5)

where d is a (not necessarily bounded) operator
on h which is called a generalized dirac operator
[3] and which satises the following properties:

 d = d (this ensures positivity ds2  0)

 [d, f ]  b(h) f  a

 d has compact resolvent

a metric space structure is then given by the
connes distance function on the structure space
of a,

d(x, y) =

sup

|x(f )  y(f )|

(2.6)

fa : k[d,f ]k1

the generalized dirac operator also enables
one to introduce concepts from ordinary dier-
ential geometry. using d one may dene a rep-
resentation of abstract dierential one-forms as

d(f dg) = f [d, g]

(2.7)

and similarly one can introduce a representation
of higher degree forms (in that case a quotient
space must be considered in order to eliminate
the so-called junk forms) [3]. gauge theories are
also readily generalized to this setting. gener-
ally, within this algebraic framework a vector
bundle corresponds to a nitely-generated pro-
jective module over the algebra a (the corre-
sponding space of smooth sections when a =
c(m, c)). however, in the following we shall
consider, for simplicity, only the case of trivial
bundles. a gauge potential a is then a one-form
of the type (2.7) and a connection is provided
via the dirac operator through the denition of
a gauge covariant derivative

da = d + a

(2.8)

the gauge group is dened as the group of uni-
tary elements of the algebra,

u(a) =(cid:8)u  a | uu = uu = i(cid:9)

(2.9)

and gauge transformations are the inner auto-
morphisms of the algebra, i.e.
the maps gu :

noncommutative geometry and string duality

f. lizzia and r.j. szabob

a  a which act as conjugation by a unitary
element u  u(a),

gu(f ) = uf u

(2.10)

the usual ingredients of a gauge theory on a
manifold may then be summarized as the follow-
ing algebraic elements:

 connections: a = pn fn [d, gn], fn, gn 

a

 curvature: f = [d, a] + a2

larized trace, e.g. the dixmier trace [3])

 bosonic action: r f 2 (where r is a regu-
 fermionic action: r  da

the set of three ingredients (a, h, d), i.e.
a -algebra a of bounded operators acting on
a separable hilbert space h and a generalized
dirac operator d on h, is called a spectral triple
(or a dirac k-cycle). the spectral triple en-
codes all the topological and geometrical infor-
mation about a riemannian manifold. but no-
tice that its construction is made with no refer-
ence to any underlying space, and that it also
applies to generic (not necessarily commutative)
algebras. we shall now describe a number of ex-
amples.

spin manifolds

if m is a compact spin manifold, we take

a = c(m, c)
h = l2(m, s)
d = i i i

(2.11)

where l2(m, s) is the hilbert space of square in-
tegrable spinors on m and the algebra a acts di-
agonally on h by pointwise multiplication. here
i are the usual dirac matrices generating the
cliord algebra {i, j} = 2gij of m and  =
d+ is the usual covariant derivative constructed
from the spin connection of m . the invariant
line element of m is now represented as the free
massless fermion propagator on m and the dis-
tance function (2.6) is

d(x, y) = sup
|f|1

|f (x)  f (y)|

(2.12)

4

note that the distance formula (2.12), which is
dened in terms of complex-valued functions on
m , is dual to the geodesic distance formula (2.2),
which is dened in terms of arcs connecting x to y
in m . notice also how the riemannian geometry
of m is naturally encoded within the denition
of the dirac operator.

the action functionals described above cor-
responding to a gauge theory constructed from
this spectral triple yield the usual one for electro-
dynamics on the manifold m , with gauge group
the unimodular loop group c(m, s1) of u (1)
gauge transformations on m . note that the spec-
tral triple (2.11) is that which naturally arises
from quantizing the free geodesic motion of a test
particle on m . then a is the algebra of observ-
ables, h is the hilbert space of physical states,
and the hamiltonian h = d2 is the laplace-
beltrami operator of m . thus ordinary (commu-
tative) spaces can be thought of as those probed
by quantum mechanical test particles.
it is in
this way that noncommutative geometry may be
thought of as quantum geometry.

morita equivalence

the natural extension of the previous example is

a = c(m, c)  mn (c)
h = l2(m, s)n
d = i i i  in

(2.13)

where mn (c) is the algebra of n  n complex-
valued matrices and in is the n  n identity
matrix. the gauge group is now the group of
u (n ) gauge transformations c(m, u (n )) on
m and the spinors of h transform in the vec-
tor representation of u (n ). since the algebra a
of matrix-valued functions on the manifold m is
noncommutative, the gelfand-naimark theorem
does not apply to this case and it is not possible
to formally identify points of a space. in fact,
there is an n dimensional sphere of pure states at
each point (corresponding to the various unitary
equivalent representations) which can be thought
of as an internal kaluza-klein isospin space with
points connected by u (n ) gauge transformations.
nevertheless, it is clear that the conguration
space of the quantum theory corresponding to
(2.13) is still the manifold m . the choices of

noncommutative geometry and string duality

f. lizzia and r.j. szabob

abelian subalgebras of mn (c) create n copies
of the same manifold connected by gauge trans-
formation.

the apparent paradox is resolved by noticing
that the algebra mn (c) has only one non-trivial
irreducible representation as a c-algebra. thus
the spectral triples (2.11) and (2.13) both de-
termine the same space. this phenomenon is
captured formally by saying that the algebras
c(m, c) and c(m, c)  mn (c) are morita
equivalent. a c-algebra b is morita equivalent
to a c-algebra a if it is isomorphic to the alge-
bra end0
a(e) of compact endomorphisms of some
a-module e. this means that the two algebras
become isomorphic upon tensoring them with the
algebra of compact operators. morita equivalent
c-algebras have equivalent representation theo-
ries. they therefore dier only in the structure
of their internal spaces (i.e. their gauge symme-
tries). the action functionals corresponding to
(2.13) yield the usual massless u (n ) gauge the-
ory on the manifold m .

the two-sheeted spacetime

let us now consider the spectral triple [17]

where h is the algebra of quaternions and m is
the 3  3 fermion mass matrix. the unimodu-
lar group of the algebra a is the familiar gauge
group c(m, u (1)su (2)su (3)) of the stan-
dard model and h represents the physical hilbert
space of six generation fermions. the action func-
tional consists of the yang-mills action and the
higgs term. the spectral triple (2.15) thereby
shows how electroweak and chromodynamic de-
grees of freedom are induced by the geometry
involving a discrete internal kaluza-klein space.

the noncommutative torus

the spectral triples we have considered thus far
all have the property that they contain an un-
derlying ordinary geometry, i.e.
their algebras
have the form a = c(m, c)  af where af
is a nite dimensional algebra. we now turn to
a genuine example of a noncommutative geome-
try, in which it is impossible to think of points,
that will turn out to play a prominant role in the
string theory applications.

consider a d dimensional torus td = rd/2,
where  is a euclidean lattice of rank d with bi-
linear form gij. let ij be a real-valued antisym-
metric matrix. we dene an algebra a() with
generators ui, i = 1, . . . , d, and relations

a = c(m, c)  z2
h = l2(m, s)  z2
m

d = (cid:18) i i i

i i i(cid:19)

m

(2.14)

uiui = ui ui = i
uiuj = e2iij
ujui

(2.16)

where m is a fermion mass. the bosonic action
functional corresponding to (2.14) gives not only
the usual yang-mills term, but also the higgs
potential with its biquadratic form. this (com-
mutative) space therefore gives a geometrical ori-
gin for the higgs mechanism associated with the
spontaneous breaking of the u (1)  u (1) gauge
symmetry of a down to u (1) corresponding to
the diagonal projection of a onto c(m, c).

the standard model

the previous example can be generalized to the
noncommutative geometry [17]

a = c(m, c)  [c  h  m3(c)]
h = l2(m, s)  [c  c2  c3]

d = (cid:18) i i i  i3

i i i  i3(cid:19) (2.15)

a generic smooth element f of the completion
a()
 of a() is a linear combination of monomials
in the ui,

fp u p1

1 u p2

2    u pd

d

(2.17)

f = xp

where  is the dual lattice to  and fp are ele-
ments of the schwartz space s() of sequences
of rapid decrease. the abstract algebra a()
 can
be given a concrete representation as a quantum
deformation of the algebra c(td, c) of func-
tions on the torus. the product of two functions
f, g  c(td, c) is now given by

(f  g)(x) = exp(cid:0)iij 

xi

(2.18)
which is just the usual rule for multiplying weyl
ordered symbols of quantum mechanical opera-
tors. with the product (2.18) the generators in

noncommutative geometry and string duality

f. lizzia and r.j. szabob

(2.16) are just the usual basic plane waves

ui = eixi

(2.19)

and the expansion (2.17) can be thought of as a
generalized fourier series expansion.

later on we will see that for toroidally compact-
ied string theory, morita equivalence of the cor-
responding noncommutative tori is precisely the
same notion as target space duality on the asso-
ciated toroidal string background.

it follows that a(0)


= c(td, c). for ij 6=
0, the algebra a()
 represents the quotient of the
ordinary torus by the orbit of a free particle in
it whose velocity vector forms an angle ij with
respect to cycles i and j of td. when the ij are
all rational numbers, the algebra a()
 is there-
fore morita equivalent to c(td, c). when the
ij are irrational, the orbits are dense and er-
godic and the resulting quotient space is not a
conventional hausdor manifold. in any of the
cases, an invariant integration may be introduced
  c which is given

via the unique tracer : a()

by the classical average

z f =ztd

dyi=1

dxi
2

f (x) = f0

(2.20)

and a dirac operator may be introduced via the
natural set of linear derivations i
 
a()
 , i = 1, . . . , d, dened by the logarithmic
derivatives

: a()

i(uj) = ij uj

(2.21)

one aspect of this example which will be par-
ticularly important for us is the set of morita
equivalence classes of noncommutative tori [18].
from (2.16) it follows that the noncommutative
tori with deformation parameters ij and ij +
ij , with ij any antisymmetric integer valued
matrix, are the same. this symmetry is part
of a larger group o(d, d; z) which parametrizes
the morita equivalence classes. it acts naturally
on the deformation matrix  as (upon picking a
suitable basis of rd,d)

   = (a + b)(c + d)1

with (cid:18) a b

c d(cid:19)  o(d, d; z)

,

(2.22)

where a, b, c, d are dd integer valued matrices
which satisfy the relations

ac + ca = 0 = bd + db
ad + cb = id

(2.23)

3. noncommutative string

spacetimes

we now seek some sort of algebra which describes
the noncommutative coordinates of spacetime
as seen by strings. the structure should be such
that at very large distance scales (much larger
than ls), where the strings eectively become
point particles which are well described by or-
dinary quantum eld theory, we recover a usual
(commutative) spacetime manifold m as described
in section 2. the elegant proposal of frohlich
and gawedzki [7], which as we will see natu-
rally incorporates duality as a gauge symmetry of
the corresponding spectral triple, is to take a to
be the vertex operator algebra of the underlying
worldsheet conformal eld theory of the string
theory. vertex operators describe interactions of
strings and they operate on the string hilbert
space as insertions on the worldsheet correspond-
ing to the emission or absorption of string states.
they therefore form the appropriate noncommu-
tative algebra which describes the quantum ge-
ometry of the space of interacting strings. in
this section we shall construct the spectral triple
associated with a toroidally compactied bosonic
string theory. the theory of vertex operator alge-
bras [10, 19] has a distinguished place in math-
ematics (having connections with the theory of
modular functions, the monster sporadic group,
etc.). we shall start by giving a very brief gen-
eral overview of the denition and properties of
a vertex operator algebra.

vertex operator algebras

any conformal eld theory naturally has associ-
ated to it two chiral algebras e which form the
operator product algebras of the (anti-)holomorphic
elds of the theory. they contain two mutually
commuting representations of the innite dimen-
sional virasoro algebra (generating the confor-

noncommutative geometry and string duality

mal invariance of the theory)

(cid:2)lk , lm(cid:3) = (k  m)lk+m + c

12 (k3  k)k+m,0
(3.1)
where c is the central charge of the string the-
ory. the algebras e act densely on the hilbert
spaces h, of left and right handed string states
respectively. the vertex operator algebra is con-
structed using the operator-state correspondence
of local quantum eld theory. namely, to each
state ()  h there corresponds a chiral ver-
tex operator v((); z), where (z+, z) are lo-
cal coordinates on a riemann surface (here we as-
sume that the worldsheet is the riemann sphere).
for a bosonic string theory, the vertex operators
can be expanded as laurent series

v((); z) = xnz

()

n

(3.2)

the vertex operator algebra a is now char-
acterized by some algebraic relations which can
be summarized as follows. the commutation re-
lations are determined by the braiding relations

z,w

where r are called braiding matrices and [  ]
is the operator which exchanges the two points
z  w along a path z,w with (anti-)clockwise
orientation on the worldsheet. the products in
(3.3) are well dened operators on h provided
that |z| < |w|. furthermore, chiral vertex op-
erators may be composed together using the fu-
sion equations

where f  are called fusion matrices. the braid-
ing and fusion relations completely characterize
the chiral algebras e. they can be combined
into a single relation known as the jacobi iden-
tity of the vertex operator algebra [19], which can
be thought of as a combination of the classical
jacobi identity for lie algebras and the cauchy
residue formula for meromorphic functions.

the full, left-right symmetric vertex opera-
tor algebra is now obtained via the sewing trans-
formations

where dkl
are complex valued sewing coe-

. the local elds
(3.5) act as operator valued distributions on the
hilbert space h = c{d}  h+  h, where
c{d} is the nite dimensional multiplicity space
which labels the various left-right sewings. the
operator-state correspondence is represented by
the relation v (; 0, 0)|vaci =   h, where |vaci
is the vacuum state of h (which we assume is
unique). locality is the constraint that two op-
erators of the type (3.5) commute whenever their
worldsheet arguments are space-like separated.
from this constraint it is possible to actually
combine the braiding and fusion relations into
a reduced set of relations known as the operator
product expansion of two local conformal elds
(3.5). for this, we grade the hilbert space h by
conformal dimensions i which are the highest
weights of the representations of the virasoro al-
gebra in e. the corresponding highest weight
vectors i for e +  e are called primary states
and are dened by

l0 i = i i

,

lk i = 0 k > 0 (3.6)

the associated vertex operators are called pri-
mary elds and they satisfy the dierential equa-
tions

erator product expansion coecients which are
functions of the braiding, fusion and sewing co-
ecients introduced above. the relation (3.8)
completely characterizes the vertex operator al-
gebra, which as we see is a rather complicated
unital -algebra.

lattice vertex operator algebras

we shall now specialize the above discussion to
the case of closed bosonic strings propagating
in a d-dimensional toroidal target space td =
rd/2. the classical string embedding elds in
such a target space are determined as the mod

spectral triples for toroidal compacti-

the nal object we require to complete the string

the operators (3.21) generate a u(1)d

kac-moody algebra whose highest weight states
are the tachyon vectors described above. the
spin bundle s  tdt d inherits a natural chiral-
ity grading from the corresponding cliord mod-
ule over the double torus, which yields two sets
of dirac matrices i
that generate the cliord
algebra {i , j } = 2gij (with all other anti-
commutators vanishing). this grading naturally
splits the hilbert space (3.13) as h = h+  h
into the 1 eigenspaces of the corresponding chi-
rality operator.

the chiral structure of the theory now en-
ables us to introduce two independent dirac op-
erators for the noncommutative geometry by [9]

d(z) = i i

(3.22)
where ()i
0 = gijpj . the choices (3.22) are not
as ad-hoc as they may rst seem. first of all, the
operator  generates reparametrizations of the
target space, so that the rst equality in (3.22)
is just the usual relationship between the dirac
operator and a covariant derivative. secondly,
it is possible to show that the energy-momentum
tensor of the conformal eld theory is related to
the dirac operator by



=  


lk zk2

t (z) = xkz

d(z)2 

(3.23)
so that the square of the dirac operator is re-
lated to the hamiltonian in the same way as in
the case of a spin-manifold. it can therefore be
thought as generating the appropriate laplace-
beltrami operator for the riemannian geome-
try. finally, it can also be shown that (3.22)
are the ramond sector fermionic zero modes of
the n = 1 worldsheet supercharges which gen-
erate supersymmetry transformations of the ap-
propriate supersymmetrization of the underlying
worldsheet conformal sigma model. the quan-
tized fermionic zero modes of these supercharges,
when acting on states of vanishing total space-
time momentum, generate the derham complex
of the manifold td  the two operators can be
identied with the exterior derivative and co-
derivative, while harmonic forms correspond to
supersymmetric (physical) states. this is just

noncommutative geometry and string duality

f. lizzia and r.j. szabob

the classic witten complex associated with two-
dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric sigma mod-
els [20]. thus the dirac operators (3.22) are in-
deed appropriate to the quantum geometry as-
sociated with the string theory. the existence
of two independent dirac operators means that
there are two spectral triples that may be con-
structed. we shall see that this feature severely
restricts the eective spacetime geometry and is
ultimately responsible for the occurence of dual-
ity symmetries in the quantum geometry.

4. target space duality

as we will now show, the existence of two natural
dirac operators for the noncommutative geome-
try of the previous section is not an ambiguous
property and is directly tied with the notion of
duality. the main feature is that there are sev-
eral isometries of the spectral triple that relate
the chirally symmetric and antisymmetric dirac
operators d, d = d+  d. an isometry in the
present context is a unitary operator t : h  h
which is an automorphism of the vertex operator
algebra a, i.e. t a t 1 = a (and in particular
it preserves the operator-state correspondence),
and which relates the two dirac operators via

d t = t d

(4.1)

this implies that, at the level of their spectral
triples, the two spacetimes associated with d and
d are the same,

(a , h , d) = (a , h , d)

(4.2)

since a change of dirac operator in noncommu-
tative geometry corresponds to a change in met-
ric on the manifold, the isomorphism (4.2) is
simply the statement of general covariance of the
noncommutative string spacetime.

a spacetime duality transformation is dened
as an isomorphism of this type which identies
subspaces of the two spectral triples in (4.2) rep-
resenting (classically) distinct ordinary spacetimes.
the idea is represented symbolically by the dia-
gram:

(a, h, d)

t (a, h, d)

0 

 0

(4.3)

(a0, h0, d0)

(a0, h0, d0)

10

in this diagram, the top line represents the iso-
morphisms between the full spectral triples, while
0 : h  h0 and 0 : h  h0 are orthogonal
projections onto subspaces which represent clas-
sical spacetime geometries, e.g. (a0, h0, d0) =
(c(td, c), l2(td, s), igijij) represents the or-
dinary torus td with its at metric gij. from
the point of view of ordinary geometry, there is
no reason for the two classical spacetimes in the
bottom line of (4.3) to be the same. however,
their embeddings into the full spectral triple rep-
resenting the noncommutative string spacetime
denes an equivalence relation under the action
of the unitary isomorphism t which identies
them at the level of the quantum geometry, i.e.
the mappings in (4.3) do not commute with the
projection operators, and hence distinct classical
spacetimes are identied. this is a very natural
and powerful way to characterize string geome-
try in terms of dierent projections of the same
spectral triple.

first, we shall establish that there indeed
does exist a natural projection of the noncom-
mutative string spacetime onto a classical, low-
energy sector. consider the subspace

h0 = ker d =

doi=1(cid:16)h

(4.4)

(+)i

the states in h0 are projected onto the vac-
uum sectors of the fock spaces, i.e.
their os-
cillatory parts vanish, as anticipated for a low-
energy regime of the string theory. the space
h
consists of those states which have vanish-
ing momentum pi = 0 and whose spinor compo-
nents carry the chiral action of the spin group
dened by the action of the dirac matrices as
gjkd+
(upon choosing appropri-
ate boundary conditions for the spinors with re-
spect to a homology basis of td  t d ) in the i-
th direction of the target space. on the other
hand, h
consists of those states which have
zero winding number wi = 0 and which trans-
form under the antichiral spinor representation
dened by +

i = i .

the 2d subspaces in the decomposition (4.4)
are all naturally isomorphic to one another [9] un-

for each i. this simply means that this

decomposition is independent of the choice of
spin structure on the torus (or equivalently of
the choice of spinor boundary conditions along
the elements of a homology basis), as it should
be, and it is a remarkable fact that this indepen-
dence is in itself an internal duality symmetry
of the string theory. it suces then to consider
only the completely antichiral subspace

(4.5)

which consists of those states of h which have

the quantum representations +
and wi = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , d. this is precisely
what one expects for the low-energy (particle-
like) regime of the string theory, whereby the
chiral structure disappears and there are no non-
local string modes that wind around the com-
pactied directions of the target space. in fact,
=
since |p, pi = eipixi
l2(td, s), where s  td is the projection of
the spin bundle s  td  t d onto its antichiral
representation. it is also straightforward to see
that the restriction of the antichiral dirac oper-
ator to the subspace (4.5) is

where 
is the corresponding or-
thogonal projection. finally, using the operator-
state correspondence, the corresponding algebra
is taken to be the projection of the commutant of
the chiral dirac operator in a (the restriction
of a to (4.5)),

the spectral triple (4.8) represents the ordinary
riemannian geometry of the torus td with met-
ric gij , and thus the dirac operator d naturally
denes the appropriate low-energy projection of
the full noncommutative string spacetime via its
zero-mode eigenspace ker d  h (or its dual ver-
sion endda  a).

the target space duality transformation (4.3)
follows from the observation that one could have
chosen d instead of d in the denition (4.4) and
carried out an analogous low energy projection.
doing so, we dene

from the point of view of classical general

(4.19)

note that (4.18) implies that the metric gij is
mapped to its dual (4.12). it is straightforward
to see that t interchanges the two dirac opera-
tors as prescribed in (4.1), and therefore gives the
required isomorphism of the corresponding spec-
tral triples. in this way, the distinct low energy
classical spacetimes (4.8) and (4.14) are identi-
ed, leading to the celebrated t -duality transfor-
mation of toroidally compactied string theory
[2], in which d  (d)1, g  g, and pi  wi.
we see therefore that in the framework of non-
commutative geometry, the t -duality transfor-
mation of a toroidal target space is just the low
energy projection of a gauge transformation on
the noncommutative string spacetime.

the t -duality mapping actually determines
only a z2 subgroup of a larger discrete duality
group of the string theory. the remaining gener-
ators come from the web of transformations be-
tween the other various subspaces of (4.4) and
(4.9). these are all constructed explicitly in [9].
for example, the mapping between the antichi-
ral subspace (4.5) and the corresponding chiral
subspace h(+)
determines the worldsheet parity

0

12

symmetry of the string theory, which acts on the
worldsheet by interchanging the chiral structures
and on the background data as   , d 
d. similarly, the mapping between (4.5) and
the subspace of ker d in which all tensor com-
ponents have chiral conditions except for the i-
th one leads to the factorized duality transfor-
mation of td, which can be thought of as the
r  1/r circle duality along the i-th cycle of
td. in the present framework, this transforma-
tion is also accompanied by a worldsheet parity
map in all of the other d  1 directions. when
d is even, the factorized dualities lead to the
phenomenon of mirror symmetry (and hence of
spacetime topology change) which exchanges the
complex and kahler structures of the torus. in
addition there other dualities which act trivially
on the spectral triples, but nonetheless do lead to
non-trivial quantum dynamics and are therefore
considered as symmetries of the quantum geom-
etry. these are the changes of basis of the com-
pactication lattice , and the torsion cohomol-
ogy shift ij  ij +ij , with ij an antisymmet-
ric integer-valued matrix, which can be absorbed
into a redenition of the momenta pi  pi 
ij wj . altogether these transformations gener-
ate the discrete duality group which is the semi-
direct product

gd = o(d, d; z)  z2

(4.20)

of the isometry group aut(  ) = o(d, d; z)
by the natural action of the worldsheet parity
group z2. the duality group (4.20) labels a large
set of low energy theories and connects various
inequivalent classical spacetimes. its action also
leaves the spectra of the dirac operators d and
d invariant.

5. gauge symmetries

in the previous section we saw that the dual-
ity group (4.20) of toroidally compactied string
theory arises in a very natural way through the
automorphisms of the noncommutative string space-
time. with the exception of worldsheet parity,
the transformations we described above were all
realized as inner automorphisms and so repre-
sented gauge symmetries of the noncommutative

noncommutative geometry and string duality

f. lizzia and r.j. szabob

geometry [9]. on the other hand, worldsheet par-
ity exchanges the left and right chiral algebras
e  e and therefore represents an outer au-
tomorphism of the vertex operator algebra (since
no element of a can accomplish this chirality re-
versal).
in this nal section we shall study in
more depth the automorphism group of the ver-
tex operator algebra, which represents the home-
omorphisms of the noncommutative space, and
focus on the consequences of the realization of
duality transformations as gauge symmetries. here
we shall set ij = 0.

automorphisms of lattice vertex opera-
tor algebras

generally, the inner automorphisms of a -algebra
a form a normal subgroup inn(a) of the auto-
morphism group aut(a). the remaining sym-
metries out(a) = aut(a)/inn(a) form the outer
automorphisms of the algebra such that the au-
tomorphism group is the semi-direct product

aut(a) = inn(a)  out(a)

(5.1)

of inn(a) by the natural action of out(a). the
inner automorphisms represent internal uctu-
ations of the noncommutative geometry corre-
sponding to rotations (2.10) of the elements of
a. consider the example of a spin manifold dis-
cussed in section 2.
in this case the inner au-
tomorphisms of a = c(m, c) are all trivial
(there are no internal symmetries for a commu-
tative algebra), while out(a) = di(m ) (given a
dieomorphism   di(m ), one may construct
the natural automorphism g(f ) = f  1 f 
a). the outer automorphisms in this case gen-
erate the general covariance of the space. on
the other hand, for the case a = c(m, c) 
mn (c), while the outer automorphisms still gen-
erate general coordinate transformations of the
manifold m , the inner automorphisms generate
the group of u (n ) gauge transformations on m .
in these two examples there is a clear distinc-
tion between (internal) gauge symmetries and
outer automorphisms, again because there is an
underlying commutative algebra which is simply
augmented by a discrete internal space. this is
not the case of the string theory spectral triple,
which represents a genuine noncommutative space.

13

as a dramatic example, we recall that the con-
served currents (3.21) are the generators of target
space reparametrizations, so that a general coor-
dinate transformation x  (x) of the space-
time may be represented by the gauge transfor-
mation [9]

t = eig  u(a)

g = i(x)(cid:0)i

+ + i

(cid:1)

(5.2)

however, these inner automorphisms are mapped
onto outer automorphisms of the commutative
()
= c(td, c), representing the dif-
algebra a
0
feomorphisms of the torus, under the low en-
ergy projection onto the ordinary geometry of td.
this is a very nontrivial fact, as it implies that
general covariance is manifested as a gauge sym-
metry of the full noncommutative string space-
time, and in this sense general relativity is in
fact really a gauge theory. this is of course what
one would like of a theory that unies all of the
fundamental interactions, in that it puts gauge
and gravitational interactions on the same foot-
ing. note that in this sense the worldsheet par-
ity transformations are implemented as dieo-
morphisms of the noncommutative string space-
time.

the realization of dualities as gauge sym-
metries yields a natural explanation of the long
standing puzzle as to the origin of string duality
as part of some mysterious gauge group [2]. in
the present case, the conserved currents (3.21)
along with the chiral tachyon vertex operators

(0)

generate the ane lie group dinn

(a) of pri-
mary elds of weight 1 [12]. the correspond-
ing inner automorphisms give internal perturba-
tions which preserve the grading by conformal
dimension and thereby yield isomorphic confor-
mal eld theories. generically, this group is just
the u (1)d
 kac-moody group, but there
are points in the moduli space of toroidal com-
pactications at which this group is enhanced to
a non-abelian gauge symmetry, such as an ane
su (2)d
 kac-moody group. a natural
subgroup of the automorphism group of a lattice
vertex operator algebra is therefore given by [12]

(0)

aut(0)(a) =dinn

(a)  out(a)

(5.3)

noncommutative geometry and string duality

f. lizzia and r.j. szabob

where the group of outer automorphisms is

out(a) = o(d, d; z)  o(2; r)

(5.4)

where o(d, d; z) represents those automorphisms
which preserve the bilinear form of the lorentzian
lattice   , while o(2; r) is a worldsheet sym-
metry group which is an extension of worldsheet
parity that acts by rotating the two chiral sectors
of the theory among each other. the full auto-
morphism group is very large and is not known in
explicit form. it is related to some exotic math-
ematical constructions, such as the monster spo-
radic group [19]. but the qualitative form of (5.3)
and the occurence of duality as a gauge symme-
try is a generic property of all duality symme-
tries. for instance, all of these structures can
be shown to hold for asymmetric duality groups,
such as those associated with heterotic strings
[14], and also for non-perturbative sl(2; z) s-
duality symmetries [11].

duality equivalence classes

in the previous section we saw the eects of quan-
tum geometry at the level of classical spectral
triples. the full-blown noncommutative geome-
try comes into play at the level of the automor-
phisms which implement these quantum symme-
tries. for instance, the dieomorphism gauge
symmetries (5.2) are associated with the gravi-
ton operators (3.20) which represent the lowest
oscillatory excitation of the classical spacetime.

(0)

the other set of generators of dinn

(a), i.e. the
tachyon vertex operators, turn out to also give a
noncommutative perturbation of classical space-
time that we shall now proceed to describe.

the operator product of two tachyon opera-

tors may be written as

vq+q (z+, z) vr+r(w+, w)
= (z+  w+)q+

i gij r+

j (z  w)q

i gij r

vq+q(z+, z) vr+r(w+, w) 

(5.5)

the expression (5.5) is in general singular at co-
inciding points of the operators, and to make
proper sense of it the vertex operators must be
suitably regularized. doing so (see [13] for de-
tails), by interchanging the order of the two op-
erators the relation (5.5) induces a local cocycle

14

relation which, up to a permutation of the coordi-
nate directions of td  t d , is independent of the
worldsheet coordinates z and w. this local
cocycle relation may be easily recognized as the

more precisely, the tachyon algebra generated by
the operators vq+q denes a unitary equivalence
class of self-dual z2-twisted projective modules of
rank 2d over the double noncommutative torus
t (+)d
  t ()d
(one copy for each chiral sector of
the vertex operator algebra along with a z2 twist
coming from the cocycle factors in (3.17)). no-
tice, however, that according to (3.18) the prod-
uct of two projected tachyon operators (made via
the operator-state correspondence by mapping
onto l2(tdt d , s)) is commutative and just rep-
resents the algebra of functions on td  t d . in
the case at hand, two given operators are rst
multiplied together in the full algebra, and then
the result is projected onto the tachyon sector
of the noncommutative geometry. namely, given
v0 = 0 v 0 and w0 = 0 w 0, where v, w 
a and 0 : h  l2(td  t d , s), the deformed
product is given by

v0  w0 = 0 (v w ) 0

(5.7)

thus the algebraic properties of the vertex oper-
ator algebra give a very natural way to deform
the algebra of functions on td  t d which takes
into account of the internal oscillatory modes of
the strings.

we see therefore that the intermediate regime
separating the classical torus from the highly non-
commutative string spacetime with its oscilla-
tors turned on is the tachyon algebra which is
a module for the noncommutative torus. note
that for very large distance scales, i.e. gij 
, the deformation parameter (5.6) vanishes and
the tachyon algebra coincides with the algebra of
functions on the double torus. this is just the
statement that at very large distance scales we

recover a classical spacetime. on the other hand,
at very small distance scales gij  0 and thus,
within the framework of toroidally compactied
string theory, spacetime at very short distances
is a noncommutative torus.

having identied this intermediate regime al-
lows us to explore features of the noncommuta-
tive geometry without having to deal with all of
the complicated structures that make up the full
vertex operator algebra. moreover, it enables us
to put the notion of string duality into a more
familiar mathematical parlance. namely, the de-
formation parameter (5.6) is the natural induced
antisymmetric bilinear form on the lattice , and
so it transforms under the action of the target
space duality group o(d, d; z) as in (2.22) [2, 9].
each such orbit is implemented in the full alge-
bra a by a gauge transformation t as described
above. under the equivalence relation generated
by the isomorphism of full spectral triples, the
modules for the noncommutative tori with de-
formation parameters  and  are identied.
in other words, target space dualities are natu-
rally realized as the morita equivalences among
noncommutative tori. this remarkable feature
of string geometry can be thought of as lend-
ing a physical interpretation to the mathemati-
cal notion of morita equivalence in noncommuta-
tive geometry. it is also in accord with the con-
nections that exist between the noncommutative
torus and matrix theory [6], in which the de-
formation parameter  is given by the light-like
component of the three-form tensor eld coming
from the corresponding reduction of 11-dimensional
supergravity. in that case morita equivalence re-
lates dual quantum theories which have the same
bps spectra [22].

universal gauge symmetry

let us now take the lorentzian lattice to be  
 = z  z and assume that the deformation
parameter is a rational number

 = m/n

where m and n are relatively prime positive in-
tegers. the center of a()

is innite dimensional, and the quotient a() =

{i} is isomorphic, as a unital -algebra, to mn (c).

the physical relevance of this special case is
many-fold. first of all, any smooth element of
the su(n ) lie algebra can be expanded in terms
of products of the generators (5.10), such that
in the limit n  ,   0 it becomes the
poisson-lie algebra of smooth functions on the
2-torus with respect to the usual poisson bracket
[5, 10]. this is similar to what occured for the
vertex operator algebra, whereby some of the
gauge symmetries of the noncommutative geom-
etry projected onto outer automorphisms of the
classical spacetime. the large-n limit of su (n )
is relevant to the matrix theory description of
m-theory, in which n is proportional to the lon-
gitudinal momentum and the limit n   de-
scribes dynamics in the innite momentum frame
[5]. the gauge symmetry here is then represented
by the innite unitary group su () which is an
example of a universal gauge group [12, 21]. the
canonical universal gauge groups of vertex oper-
ator algebras, representing the algebras overlying
all of the dynamical symmetries of string theory,
may thus be related, through the connection with
the noncommutative torus, to su ().

more ambitiously, one can imagine that the
noncommutative 2-torus with rational deforma-
tion parameter (5.8) is some sort of nite dimen-
sional approximation to the vertex operator al-
gebra. in the correlated limit n, m   with 
a xed irrational number, we recover the gen-
uine noncommutativetorus (the center (5.9) is

noncommutative geometry and string duality

then trivial) which is related to a corresponding
vertex operator algebra as described above with
an explicit representation of the universal gauge
symmetry. the noncommutative geometry asso-
ciated with rank 2 lattice vertex operator alge-
bras may in this way be relevant to the true non-
commutative geometric structure encompassing
the large-n limit of matrix theory. however, in
order for this to be true, one needs to realize the
noncommutative string spacetime as some limit
of a tower of nite dimensional matrix geome-
tries.

the potential relevance to matrix theory
compactications comes from the observation that
the morita equivalence of the noncommutative
2-torus can be naturally interpreted as the zero
area limit of the usual string theoretical sl(2; z)
duality in the presence of a background neveu-
schwarz two-form eld  [23]. in supergravity,
this is not a geometrical symmetry in the usual
sense, but in the framework of noncommutative
geometry it is. in the present case, the eld 
is given explicitly by (5.6) and in the zero area
limit we obtain a highly noncommutative struc-
ture. this is in precise agreement with the idea
that toroidal compactications at very small dis-
tance scales are equivalent to noncommutative
tori.

using the projections of the two dirac operators

the bosonic part yields a symmetrized yang-
mills type functional with the above interaction
vertices, constructed from two vector potentials
a(x, x) and a(x, x). the fermionic part con-
tains fermion elds minimally coupled to the gauge
potentials, again determined by a non-local in-
teraction vertex coming from the representation
of the noncommutative tachyon algebra on the
hilbert space l2(td  t d , s), i.e.

noncommutative gauge theory

the mapping onto the noncommutative torus can
also be used to give a dynamical model for the
duality symmetries of the noncommutative string
spacetime, through the construction of an explic-
itly duality symmetric noncommutative gauge the-
ory [13]. the action functional of the gauge the-
ory dened from the twisted module over the
noncommutative torus is obtained using the in-
variant integration (2.20) and the derivations (2.21).
the interaction vertices are constructed from the
commutator which is represented by the moyal
bracket

[f, g] = {f, g} = f  g  g  f

(5.11)

where the deformed product of two functions f, g 
c(td  t d , c) is given by

(f  g)(x, x)

the noncommutative gauge theory so con-
structed in possesses a number of symmetries.
the fact that the action is manifestly gauge in-
variant leads immediately to its explicit invari-
ance under target space duality transformations
(represented by the actions of inner automor-
phisms) and also its general covariance. it is also
invariant under the outer automorphism group
(5.4) representing dieomorphisms of the non-
commutative geometry. this includes the morita
equivalence acting on the doublet of vector po-
tentials by the vector representation of o(d, d; z),
and also the o(2; r) chiral rotations of the dou-
blet. like the usual formulations of duality sym-
metric action functionals, this model possesses
an o(2; r) doublet of vector potentials, but the
present gauge theory is generally covariant with-
out the need of introducing auxiliary elds. the
price to pay for this is the nonlocality of the

gauge interactions, but from the point of view
of quantum eld theoretic renormalizability the
present model is in fact completely well-dened.
the gauge theory can be considered as a dy-
namical model which measures how much dual-
ity symmetry is present in the target space and
hence how far away the stringy perturbation is
from ordinary classical spacetime [13]. the ac-
tion functional can thereby be regarded as an
eective measure of distance scales in the space-
time.

the nonlocality which arises in this eld the-
ory can also be shown to be induced by d1-
branes wrapping a highly oblique 2-torus [23],
whose worldvolume eld theory is thereby de-
scribed by 2+1 dimensional noncommutative gauge
theory. by t -duality, this gauge theory also de-
scribes d0-branes on a very small 2-torus with
non-zero neveu-schwarz two-form eld, which in
the large n limit becomes the matrix theory
description of m-theory with a non-zero back-
ground three-form eld and a light-like compact-
ication circle. it would be interesting to pursue
further the interrelationships that exist between
the two noncommutative geometric approaches,
one based on (worldsheet) vertex operator alge-
bras and the other on (target space) matrix the-
ory compactications, to string theory and m-
theory. their very natural relationships to the
noncommutative torus hints that the connection
may not be very far away.
