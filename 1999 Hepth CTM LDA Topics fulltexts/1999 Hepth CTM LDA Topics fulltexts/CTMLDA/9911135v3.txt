abstract

we consider free superconformal theories of n = 8 scalar multiplet in d = 3 and
(2, 0) tensor multiplet in d = 6 and compute 2-point and 3-point correlators of their
stress tensors. the results for the 2-point and the 3-point correlators for a single d = 3
and d = 6 multiplet dier from the strong-coupling ads4 and ads7 supergravity
predictions by the factors 42
3 n 3/2 and 4n 3 respectively. these are the same factors
as found earlier in hep-th/9703040 in the comparison of the brane free eld theory and
the d = 11 supergravity predictions for the absorption cross-sections of longitudinally
polarized gravitons by n m2 and m5 branes. while the correspondence of the results
for the cross-sections and 2-point functions was expected on the basis of unitarity, the
fact that the same coecients appear in the ratio of the free-theory and supergravity
3-point functions is non-trivial. thus, like in the d = 4 sym case, in both d = 3 and
d = 6 theories the ratio of the 3-point and 2-point correlators < t t t > / < t t > is
exactly the same in the free eld theory and in the interacting cft as described (to
leading order in large n ) by the 11-dimensional supergravity on adsd+1  s10d.

1 introduction and summary

in contrast to the low-energy theory on multiple d3-branes represented by n = 4 sym
theory, the d = 3 and d = 6 superconformal theories describing a large number n of

coincident m2 and m5 branes remain poorly understood (see, e.g., [1, 2] for reviews and
references). the m2 brane cft is expected to be described by an ir xed point of d = 3

u(n) sym theory. the coincident m5 brane theory is expected to be a new kind of d = 6
cft related to a theory of tensionless strings [3] (for its dlcq description see [4]). at

a generic point of moduli space, i.e. away from the m5-brane coincidence point, the m5
brane theory should be represented by n interacting tensor multiplets (see also [5] and refs.
therein). both d = 3 and d = 6 theories become free in the n = 1 limit, but for n > 1 they

are still lacking a computationally useful description.

a few basic facts that follow from the properties of the corresponding classical super-

gravity solutions [6, 7] are:

(i) the collective coordinates of a single m2 brane are represented by n = 8, d = 3 scalar
multiplet (8 scalars and 8 majorana spinors) [8], while the collective coordinates of a single
m5 brane by the (2,0) d = 6 multiplet (5 scalars, 2 weyl spinors and an anti-selfdual 2-form)
[9].

(ii) while the entropy of n d3 branes scales in the usual n 2 way [10], the entropy of
multiple m5 branes scales as n 3 and the entropy of m2 branes as n 3/2 [11]. this suggests
that there is a corresponding enhancement of the number of light degrees of freedom when
branes are put together. the guidance of the supergravity solution should probably be

trusted more in the m5-brane case which is a non-singular background. this is the case
we shall mostly concentrate on in what follows. the m-theory r4 correction to the d = 11
supergravity action results [12] in a subleading o(n) correction to the m5-brane entropy.

(iii) the same n 3/2 and n 3 scalings dictated by the d = 11 supergravity description
are found [13, 14] in the absorption rate of longitudinally polarized gravitons by m2-branes

and m5-branes. the supergravity absorption cross-sections have the same form [13] as the
cross-sections in the free theories of d = 3 and d = 6 multiplets, but, in addition to the
n 3/2 and n 3 factors, the supergravity and the free eld theory predictions dier also in the
numerical coecients [14]1

(1.1)

1the hep-th version of [14] used the m2 absorption cross-section which was o by the factor of 8 compared

to the result of [15]. this was corrected in the published npb version of [14].

2

this numerical discrepancy was absent in the d3 brane case where the precise agreement [13]
between the free-theory and the supergravity absorption rates can be understood [16] as a

consequence of the non-renormalization theorem for the correlator of the two stress tensors
in n = 4 sym theory, and is intimately related [17] to the ads/cft correspondence
[18, 17, 19].

some ads7  s4 supergravity predictions for the properties (spectrum, correlators, con-
formal anomaly) of the (2,0) non-abelian tensor multiplet theory were studied also in [20,

21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].

our prime aim below is to compute the 2- and 3-point correlators of the stress tensors

in the free d = 6 tensor multiplet theory and to compare the result to the ads supergravity
correlators found in [33] (< t t >) and [35] (< t t t >). since the classical supergravity

absorption cross-section is expected to be related to the ads supergravity correlator [17]
and since the unitarity relates the free eld theory graviton absorption amplitude to the

imaginary part of the (minkowski-space) correlator of the two stress tensors, one should nd
the same 4n 3 result for ratio of the free-theory cft and ads 2-point correlators. we shall
indeed conrm this by the explicit computation.

moreover, we shall nd that the 3-point ads graviton correlators are again reproduced
exactly by the d = 6 free theory < t t t > correlator, up to the same overall coecient 4n 3!
let us note that the comparison of the 3-point correlators goes way beyond the absorption
calculations in [14]  the ads/cft approach allows us to compute the multiple graviton

(stress tensor) correlators in a systematic way, something that is hard to do in the context
of the standard classical absorption calculations.

similar conclusion will be reached in the case of the d = 3 theory: the ratios of the ads

and free d = 3 cft predictions for < t t > and < t t t > will be again exactly the same
as in (1.1)  42

3 n 3/2.

in the absence of a free coupling parameter, and thus of a non-renormalization theorem
argument used in the d = 4 (n = 4 sym) case, one could expect that the 3-point correlators
may have dierent structures in the free-eld d = 6 theory and in the true strongly coupled
d = 6 cft represented (to the leading order in large n) by the d = 11 supergravity on
ads7  s4. that this does not happen seems to be non-trivial. one plausible explanation is
that the requirements of maximal superconformal symmetry are powerful enough to constrain
the form of < t t t > so that it is reproduced by the free theory calculation, up to the overall

coecient determined by the coecient in < t t > (cf. [34]). a possible point of view is that
this coecient may be n-dependent and should interpolate between the single free multiplet

3

eld theory result for n = 1 and the non-trivial cft (supergravity) result for n  .2
as far as the 2-point and 3-point correlators of stress tensor multiplet states are concerned,

the mysterious strongly coupled d = 6 cft and the free d = 6 tensor multiplet theory thus
happen to be in the same universality class.

the common overall numerical coecient 4n 3 of < t t > and < t t t > should have
an important meaning. since the only d = 6 cft we explicitly know is the free tensor
multiplet, we may try to model the cft predicted, via ads/cft correspondence, by

the supergravity m5 brane description by starting with a number of free tensor multiplets
in the d = 4 case the theory of free n 2 n = 4
and assigning internal indices to them.
vector multiplets indeed reproduces the supergravity predictions for protected 2- and 3-
point functions. the idea is then to try to x the internal index structure of the tensor
multiplet theory using the ads supergravity results as a guide. the supergravity n 3 scaling
may be formally reproduced by a model (2,0) theory where the 2-tensor, scalar and spinor

elds carry three internal indices i, j, k = 1, ..., n, i.e. the (selfdual) 2-form eld strength
is h ijk
, etc. this theory may be describing the case when three (as opposed to two [3])
m5-branes are simultaneously put together.

the entropy and correlators of composite operators like the stress tensor would then scale
as n 3 for large n (assuming there is no symmetry in internal indices which would reduce
the coecient n 3 by an integer factor). since the eld strength has non-zero dimension,
introducing interactions would break classical conformal invariance. one may speculate that
there may exist a new interacting d = 6 theory based on h ijk
 (plus its superpartners) which
is conformal at the quantum level. the hope is then that a non-trivial quantum dynamics
should be responsible for the remaining factor of 4 mismatch between the free theory and
the ads supergravity predictions.3
ignoring selfduality (and supersymmetry) constraints,
it seems likely that if a consistent interacting theory of non-abelian antisymmetric tensors
2one could try to argue, as in [36], that the structure of the m-theory action on ads7  s4 implies that
both < t t > and < t t t > should not receive subleading 1/n corrections: higher-order corrections like
r4 (written in a specic weyl-tensor scheme [12]) may not change the expressions for the 2-graviton and
3-graviton ads correlators.

3 the assignment of the three internal indices to the antisymmetric tensor seems suggested by the heuristic
explanation of the n 3 growth of the m5-brane entropy as being due to triple m5-brane connections by

membranes of pants shape (and is also related to the presence of the cubic r c3dc3dc3 term in the 11-d

supergravity action, cf.
[25]). virtual triple connections are not dominant in the case of the open strings
ending on d-branes (the 3-string interactions are subleading in the coupling) but are very natural for m5-
branes connected by membranes: any membrane surface ending on several m5-branes may be cut into
pants, with pair-wise (cylinder) connections being subleading at large n compared to the triple ones. the
importance of similar triple m5 brane connections by membranes with 3 boundaries was suggested in [37] in
order to explain the scaling of the entropy of the extremal 4-d black hole described by the 2555 intersecting

m-brane conguration (s  n1n2n3 where ni are charges of m5 branes).

in 6 dimensions bijk
 exists, its action should contain innite number of terms with leading
interaction being quartic in bijk
 playing the role of an eective coupling
constant or the structure tensor of the corresponding soft gauge algebra.4 conformal
invariance at the quantum level may be possible to achieve provided the dimension of bijk

is shifted from its classical value 2.5

 , and with h ijk

the structure of the paper is the following. to compute the free-theory correlators
< t t > and < t t t > in (2,0) theory one needs to sum together the independent 2-form,

scalar and spinor stress tensor contributions. the 2- and 3-point functions of stress tensors
of the conformal scalar and spinor elds in an arbitrary dimension d were already computed

in [39] (and refs. therein). the free k-form eld theory is conformal in dimension d = 2k + 2.
in section 2 we present the general results for the correlators of two and three stress tensors

in such theory. particular cases include the previously known d = 4 vector case and the new
d = 6 2-form case we are interested in. our general d = 2k + 2 results may be useful in other

contexts.

in section 3 we specialize to the case of the (2,0) tensor multiplet in d = 6. to nd
the contribution of the chiral 2-form eld we employ the method similar to the one used

in [40, 14] which is based on the use of the non-chiral 2-form propagator with the chirality
projectors being inserted in the vertices (composite operators). feynman rules obtained

from actions for chiral bosons [41, 42, 45] should produce equivalent results, as it happens
in the case of gravitational anomalies [43, 44]. we nd that the 3-point correlator of the
total free-theory stress tensor has exactly the same form as found in [35] from the ads7
supergravity description, apart from the overall coecient. the latter coecient 4n 3 is the
same as in the 2-point function. the overall scale of < t t t > is, in fact, related to that of

< t t > by the conformal ward identity.

in section 4 we repeat the same computation in the case of the free theory of 8 scalars

and 8 majorana spinors in d = 3 and show that again the free eld theory 3-point function
is the same as the ads4 one, apart from the overall coecient which is the same as in the
ratio of the 2-point functions or as in (1.1).

thus, like in the d = 4 sym case, in both d = 3 and d = 6 cases the ratio of the

4this may probably allow to avoid the no-go theorem of [38].
5such interacting non-abelian (2,0) supersymmetric tensor multiplet theory may be a low-energy limit
of a kind of tensionless d = 6 string theory. at a very speculative level, one may think of closed strings
in d = 6 with three chan-paton indices which may originate from virtual membranes connecting three
parallel m5-branes. when the distances between m5-branes reduce to zero, the membranes with 3 holes
may produce a special kind of strings which somehow carry three internal indices (they may be visualized as
blown-up 3-string junctions, or triangles). the basic interaction at the boundary may then be described
by bijk
 .

(1.2)

we expect that, as in the d3-brane case [46], similar results should hold also for all 2- and

3-point correlation functions of states belonging to the short multiplet of the stress tensor,
i.e. all such correlators should be reproduced by the free eld theory, apart from the same

overall normalization factors.

free conformal theory of k-form eld in d = 2k + 2

we begin by considering a free nonchiral k-form eld theory. the free eld theory of a k-form
b1...k in the minkowski space of d = 2k + 2 dimensions is described by the following action

s = 

1

2(k + 1)! z ddx h1...k+1h 1...k+1 ,

(2.3)

where h1...k+1 = 1b2...k+1  cyclic permutations.

it is well known that due to the gauge invariance the number of physical degrees of

freedom in the model is

nph =

(2k)!
(k!)2 .

after coupling this theory to gravity in the minimal way one can check its weyl invariance,
which guarantees the conformal invariance in the at space limit. dening the stress-tensor
as t  = 2g

one gets

t =

(2.4)

which is obviously traceless.

consider correlation functions of physical (gauge-invariant) observables which depend

only on the eld strength. to calculate them we need to know the propagator of the eld
strength. the simplest way to nd it is to add to the action (2.3) the lorentz gauge-xing
term 1

2(k1)! (1b12...k )2. then the propagator of the k-form eld is given by

hb1...k (x)b1...k(y)i =

with

r = x  y ,
as is well known (see, e.g., [39] and refs.
therein), the two-point function of the stress
tensor in a d-dimensional conformal eld theory is xed by the conformal invariance up to a
constant, and can be represented in the form

r =

as was shown in [39], the 3-point function of the stress tensor in a conformal eld theory is

there are two linear relations [39, 48] between the 5 constants a,b,c,d,e entering (2.8)

(2.9)

we choose a, b and c as the three independent constants. to nd them we take z = 0, y =
1, x = 21 and consider the following three correlators

ht12(x)t13(y)t23(z)i = 2d 
ht23(x)t24(y)t34(z)i = 2d t
ht12(x)t12(y)t22(z)i = 2d ( + 2 ) ,

where , t,  are the coecients in the collinear frame from eq.(4.21) of [39]. they are
related to a, b and c as follows (see eqs.(4.25) and (3.21) from [39], and the footnote on
p.21 of [48])

a = 8t

a check of these formulas is provided by the conformal ward identity relating the 2-point
and 3-point correlators [48]

ct =

2

(d + 2)(d  1)a  b  2(d + 1)c(cid:21) .

(2.16)

in terms of t, ,  this identity can be rewritten in the form

ct = 4d1(cid:18) 1

d + 2

 +

1
d

(cid:19) .

one can easily check the validity of this equation using (2.7). it is worth noting that the
conformal ward identity relation does not involve the constant t.

in the case of an even-rank k = 2l eld b the stress tensor (2.4) admits factorization into
the sum of the left and right stress tensors depending on the anti selfdual and selfdual
components of the eld h = db respectively:

t = t  + t +

 ,

t  =

1
k!

hh



.

(2.17)

moreover, one can easily show that the correlator of h and h + is proportional to the
delta-function. we assume a regularization were contact terms proportional to delta func-
tions are omitted, as this is consistent with conformal invariance, and so we can set both
hh(x)h +(y)i and ht (x)t +
(y)i to zero. this serves as a justication for the following
prescription (essentially equivalent to the one originally used in [40] and also in [14]) to

compute the correlation functions of operators depending on the eld strength in a chiral
model: one may use the non-chiral propagator (2.5) while replacing the eld strength h by
its (anti)selfdual part in the composite operators. in the case of the 2-point and 3-point
correlation functions of the stress tensor t  the correlator of t  and t +
 vanishes, and
thus the chiral correlators are equal to 1
2 of the 2-point and 3-point non-chiral correlators
of the full t.

3 the (2,0) tensor multiplet in d = 6

the (2,0) tensor multiplet in the 6-dimensional minkowski space consists of 5 scalars x i, 2
weyl fermions i
l and an antisymmetric tensor b with anti-selfdual strength. covariant
lagrangian descriptions of the 2-form part of the model exist [42], but are hard to work with
at the quantum level, since one cannot easily implement a covariant gauge xing for the

gauge symmetry that gives the (anti)selfduality constraint. however, it is sucient for our
aims to use a lagrangian containing a non-chiral 2-form with the prescription of projecting

out its selfdual part in the relevant composite operators. thus, the stress tensor of the
system is given by the sum of the stress tensors of the elds

t = t h

the stress tensor (3.18) coincides, up to a factor, with the stress tensor for the (2,0) tensor
multiplet found in [49] by using a dierent method. note that the scalar stress tensor
contains the improvement term as needed for conformal invariance (on-shell tracelessness).7
the 2- and 3-point correlation functions of the stress tensors of the free scalar and spinor

theories in arbitrary number d of dimensions were previously computed in [39]. we extend
those results by including the contributions of k-forms (with the understanding that this
additional contribution is present only in the suitable conformal d = 2k + 2 dimensions).
thus, the corresponding constants ct , a, b and c in < t t > (2.6) and < t t t > (2.8) are
4(d1) rx 2 term on a curved d = 6 background. this term
was not included in the absorption calculation in [14] since it gives zero contribution to the tree-level 3-point
amplitude with on-shell graviton. however, this term is crucial for the scalar stress tensor correlators to
have the canonical cft form described in the previous section.

we are now going to compare these free eld theory results with the ones obtained from the
11-dimensional supergravity on the ads7  s4 background describing the near-horizon limit
of n coincident m5-branes. in units in which the radii of the two spaces are rads = 1 and

we assumed that the coupling of t(x) with h(x) at the boundary of adsd+1 has the
2t(x)h(x). taking into account the value of the gravitational

constant 7, we nd that for d = 6

this diers by the factor 4n 3 from the value (3.23) obtained from the free eld theory. this
factor coincides with the one obtained in [14] by comparing the absorption cross-sections

calculated using the d = 11 supergravity and the free world-volume eld theory descriptions.
the constants a, b and c were computed in the general case of adsd+1 gravity in [35]. for
d = 6 they are given by

a(ads) = 4n 3 
b(ads) = 4n 3 
c(ads) = 4n 3

comparing these values with the ones obtained in the (2,0) tensor multiplet model (3.24) we
see that they again dier by the same factor 4n 3. the overall scale of these three constants
is, of course, determined by ct in view of the conformal ward identity (2.16), but it is quite
remarkable that the relative scales of a,b,c are exactly the same in the free eld theory
and in the ads7 supergravity!

this suggests that all 2- and 3-point correlation functions of the states from the stress

tensor short multiplet in the interacting (2,0) superconformal eld theory coincide (in the
large n limit) with the corresponding ones in the free theory of 4n 3 (2,0) tensor multiplets.
as a check of this expectation we can calculate the 2- and 3-point functions of the lowest
chiral primary operators

oi = ci

ijx ix j ,

(3.30)

where ci
ij is a symmetric traceless tensor, while the index i denotes a complete basis of such
tensors, and compare them with the ones obtained from the 11-dimensional supergravity

in [30]. normalizing the operators in such a way that the ratio of the 2-point functions
calculated in ads7 gravity and in the free theory is 4n 3, we nd again that the ratio of the
3-point functions is also 4n 3.

4 m2-brane case: ads4  free d = 3 cft comparison

in this section we compare the 2- and 3-point functions of the stress tensor of the eective
action for n m2-branes calculated from the 11-dimensional ads4  s7 supergravity and in
the 3-dimensional free eld theory of 8 scalars and 8 majorana fermions.

we choose units in which rads = 1, so that rs 7 = 2, and thus

by using (3.22) we obtain the following values of the 4 basic constants in the free d = 3

conformal eld theory of 8 scalars and 8 majorana fermions

a(f ree) =

(4.34)

(4.35)

although the constants (4.33) and (4.35) look dierent, this does not mean that the cor-
responding 3-point functions dier too. in fact, as was shown in [39], in three dimensions
there are only two independent conformal tensor structures in < t t t >, and, therefore,

only two linear combinations of the constants in (2.8) have got an invariant meaning. these
two independent constants may be expressed in terms of a, b and c as follows

p = 4a + 3b  14c ,

q = a  2c .

then a straightforward calculation gives

t

c (ads)
c (f ree)

t

p (f ree) = q(ads)
q(f ree) =

(4.36)

(4.37)

using the results of [30] and a simple free theory computation, one can also check that
the ratio of the 2- and 3-point functions of the properly normalized chiral primary operators

13

(3.30) is again given by the same factor (4.37), which coincides also with the one obtained in
the comparison of graviton absorption cross-sections in [14]. it seems natural to expect that

all 2- and 3-point functions of operators from the short multiplet of the stress tensor in the
eective theory of n m2-branes coincide, up to this overall factor, with the ones computed in
the n = 8 free eld theory. the meaning of this irrational proportionality constant (which
looks somewhat ugly compared to 4n 3 in the d = 6 case) remains unclear.
