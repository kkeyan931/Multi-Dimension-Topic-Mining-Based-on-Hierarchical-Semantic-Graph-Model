1 introduction

discrete analogs of various special coordinate systems on two-dimensional surfaces in three-
dimensional euclidean space, and discrete analogs of multi-dimensional conjugated coordi-
nate nets have attracted great interest recently [1, 2, 3].

this interest has been motivated by revealed connections between corresponding prob-
lems of classical (continuous) dierential geometry and modern problems of mathematical
and theoretical physics. for example, it turned out that one of the central problems of
the dierential geometry of the previous century: the problem of constructing n-orthogonal
curvilinear coordinate systems, or at diagonal metrics

ds2 =

nxi=1

h 2

i (u)(dui)2,

u = (u1, . . . , un),

(1.1)

is deeply connected to the theory of integrable quasilinear (1 + 1)-systems of the hydrody-
namic type. these systems are the core of the whitham approach to the perturbation theory
of soliton equations [4, 5, 6]. moreover, as it was noticed in [7], the classication problem of
the so-called darboux  egoro metrics, i. e. at diagonal metrics such that

jh 2

i = ih 2
j ,

i =


ui ,

(1.2)

is equivalent to the classication problem of massive topological quantum eld models [8, 9,
10].

it should be emphasized that classical results [11] in the theory of n-orthogonal curvilinear
coordinate systems were mainly of classication nature, and as a result the list of explicit
examples of such coordinate systems was relatively short. in the remarkable paper [12] it
was shown that a wide class of solutions to the lame equations which describe the rotation
coecients

ij =

ihj
hi

,

i 6= j,

(1.3)

of at diagonal metrics, can be obtained with the help of the dressing procedure which
is well-known in the theory of solitons. results of [12, 13] were a starting point of the
work [14] by one of the authors, where a construction of algebro-geometric n-orthogonal
coordinate systems was proposed, and a new type of solutions of the associativity equations
was found. explicit expressions in terms of the riemann theta-functions associated with
auxiliary algebraic curves were obtained.

originally the main goal of this paper was to construct discrete analogs of the algebro-
geometric n-orthogonal coordinate systems. note, that in general the problem of nding an
integrable discrete analog of integrable continuous system is ill-dened and has no universal
answer. at the same time discretization methods developed in the theory of solitions are
universal enough to be applicable to all the systems that are considered in the framework
of the inverse method. they use natural discretization of auxiliary linear problems or even

2

more natural change of analytical properties with respect to spectral parameter of common
eigenfunctions of auxiliary linear problems.

it turns out that discretization of the algebro-geometric scheme of [14] leads to a construc-
tion of lattices of vectors x(u) = (x1(u), . . . , xn(u)) in the euclidean space parameterized by
integer n-dimensional vectors u = (u1, . . . , un), ui  z, and satisfying planar and circular
conditions. these conditions were proposed in [15] as discrete analogs of general n-orthogonal
coordinate systems. note, that planar and circular lattices in three-dimensional space were
introduced for the rst time in [16], based on the earlier works [17] and [18, 19].

the planar condition means that for each pair of indices i, j the corresponding elementary
quadrilateral of the lattice, i. e. the polygon with vertices {x(u), tix(u), tjx(u), titjx(u)},
is at. here and below ti denotes the shift operator in the discrete variable ui:

tix(u1, . . . , ui, . . . , un) = x(u1, . . . , ui + 1, . . . , un).

the circular condition means that each of the elementary quadrilatteral can be inscribed
into a circle, i. e. that the sum of opposite angles of the polygon equals .

the main goal of the paper is to prove integrability of the lattices satisfying more rigid
constraint than the circular condition. namely, that for each pair of indices i 6= j the edges
of the lattice

x +

i (u) = tix(u)  x(u), x 

j (u) = t 1

j x(u)  x(u)

with vertices {x(u), tix(u)} and {x(u), t 1

j x(u)} are orthogonal to each other, i. e.

hx +

i , x 

j i = 0.

(1.4)

(1.5)

here and below h  ,  i stands for euclidean scalar product of n-dimensional vectors. note
that (1.5) implies that the two opposite angles of the polygon are right and therefore, the
corresponding lattice satises the circular condition.

lattices satisfying (1.5) will be called darboux  egoro lattices, because (1.5) implies in
particular, that there exists a potential function (u) such that its discrete derivatives equal
to the lengths of edges:

i(u) = hx +

i (u), x +

i (u)i.

(1.6)

note that in the continuous case the denition (1.2) of the darboux  egoro metric is
equivalent to the existence of function  such that i = h 2

i = hix, ixi.

constraint (1.5) has naturally arisen from the discretization of the algebro-geometric
scheme [14]1. moreover, the algebro-geometric construction of darboux  egoro lattices
suggests the possibility to introduce discrete analogs of the lame coecients h
it
should be mentioned that unlike the continuous case the denition of such coecients is
local, but not ultra-local and requires scalar products of edges not from the same but also

i (u).

1when the reduction (1.5) was found the authors became aware that the same reduction was proposed

in [20].

3

from the nearest vertices. as a result, it turns out that the proof that these coecients are
well-dened is not evident.

this proof is presented in the next section of the paper. in the third section we derive a full
set of equations which describe the discrete lame coecients and prove their integrability.
algebro-geometric construction of the darboux  egoro lattices is presented in the last
section.

we use the following notation for the discrete derivatives:

if (u) = tif (u)  f (u),



i f (u) = t 

i f (u)  f (u),

i = t 1
t 

i

.

various objects in the paper has upper indices + and . sometimes for the sake of brevity
we omit the index +, i. e. we assume that f (u) = f +(u). we use also the following discrete
analogs of the leibnitz rule

i(f (u)g(u)) = if (u) g(u) + tif (u) ig(u) =

= if (u) g(u) + f (u) ig(u) + if (u) ig(u)

and the formula for taking discrete derivatives of a ratio

i(cid:18)f (u)

g(u)(cid:19) =

if (u) g(u)  f (u) ig(u)

g(u) tig(u)

.

at the end of the introduction we would like to emphasize that our denition of the discrete
lame coecients extensively uses the properties of the darboux  egoro lattices. the
problem of a similar description of intrinsic geometry of general analogs of at diagonal
metrics is still open. we would like to consider this problem and more general problem of
intrinsic geometry on graphs in future.

2 discrete analogs of the lame coecients

to begin with let us give an equivalent denition of the darboux  egoro lattices. this
denition uses only the orthogonality properties of edges of the lattice. note, that all the
lattices in this paper are assumed to be non-degenerate, i. e. for any u the vectors xi(u),
i = 1, . . . , n, are linearly independent.

lemma 2.1 the following denitions 10 30 of the darboux  egoro lattice x(u) are equiv-
alent:
10. the lattice x(u) is planar and for any i 6= j equation (1.5) holds:

20. for any triple of indices i, j, m dierent from each other we have

hxi, x 

j i = 0.

hx +

i , x 

j i = 0,

4

htmx +

i , x 

j i = 0.

(2.1)

30. for any j 6= i and any set {m1, m2, . . . , ms} of distinct indices which does not contain i
it follows

hx +

i , x 

j i = 0,

h(cid:16) sqk=1

tmk(cid:17)x +

i , x 

j i = 0.

(2.2)

proof. since x(u) is planar we see that the vector tmxi is a linear combination of the vectors
xi and xm. from (1.5) it follows that tmxi is orthogonal to x 
j . therefore, the equality
(2.1) follows from the denition 10.

in the reverse case, from (2.1) it follows that the vectors xi, xj and tixj are orthogonal
to all the vectors x 
m, m 6= i, j. since the lattice is non-degenerate due to our assumption
we obtain that xi, xj and tixj belong to the two-dimensional plane, which is orthogonal
to all vectors x 

m, m 6= i, j. this implies that the lattice is planar.

we have proved that denitions 10 and 20 are equivalent. in the same way one can prove
(cid:3)

the equivalence of denitions 20 and 30.

theorem 2.1 for any darboux  egoro lattice x(u) there exists a unique set of functions
i (u), i = 1, . . . , n, normalized by the condition h+
h
i (0, . . . , 0) = 1, and such that the following
equalities for the scalar products of edges of the lattice hold

hxi, xii = 2(tih+

i )  h
i ;

i i = (tih+
i i = (titjh+

i ),

hxi, x 

htjxi, x 

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

i 6= j.

note that equalities (2.32.5) are invariant under the gauge transformation h
where {ai} is a set of arbitrary nonzero constants. initial conditions h+
to x the gauge.

i (u) 7 a1

i h
i ,
i (0) = 1 are chosen

proof. let us x some index i. first we shall show that equations (2.32.5) imply pfa-type
system of partial dierence equations for the function h+
i . using (2.3, 2.4) we obtain two
dierent expressions for h
i :

h
i =

hxi, xii
2tih+
i

=

htixi, xii

titih+
i

.

(2.6)

(here and later we use equality tix 
of x 

i ). it follows from (2.6) that h+

i = xi, which follows directly from the denition

i satises the dierence equation

(2.10)

let us denote the vectors x 
i , xi, tjxi, titjxi by a, b, c and d respectively (see g. 1).
consider orthogonal projections a, d of the vectors a, d on the plane spanned by the
edges xi and xj (the plane of the central plaquet in g. 1). replacing a, d by a, d in
equation (2.10), we change no scalar product in it. dividing both sides by |a||d|, we obtain

ha, ci hc, di
|a||c|2|d|

= cos(a, c) cos(c, d) = cos(a, b) cos(b, d) =

ha, bi hb, di

|a||b|2|d|

.

it follows from the denition 10 of the darboux  egoro lattice that the vectors a and c are
both orthogonal to the vector l = xj. similarly, b and d are both orthogonal to r = tixj.
consequently,

cos(a, c) = cos(b, d) = 1,

cos(a, b) = cos(c, d).

the latter equalities prove compatiblity of (2.7) and (2.8).

let us consider now two equations (2.8) for indices j and k such that i 6= j 6= k. in
terms of the coecients bj and bk of these equations their compatibility is equivalent to the
equality bk  tkbj = bj  tjbk, which can be written as follows

let us introduce the following notations: a = t 
i , d = tktjxi
(see g. 2). let c be the three-dimensional cube with edges t 
i xk (the
central cube in g. 2). let a and d be orthogonal projections of the vectors a and d on
the three-dimensional space spanned by the edges of c. one can replace a, d by a, d,

respectively, in (2.11) without changing scalar products in it. moreover, equality (2.11)
remains valid if the vectors a and d are multiplied by any non-zero constants.

i xj and t 

from the orthogonality properties of the darboux  egoro lattices it follows that a is
i , because both of them are orthogonal to the plane l, spanned
by t 
i ,
because they are orthogonal to the plane r, spanned by xj and xk (right face of c). hence,

proportional toea = tjtkx 
i xk (left face of c). in the same way, the vector d is proportional toed = x 
in (2.11) we may replace a and d by the vectorsea and ed. if we divide it by |ea||ed|, it takes

the form

hea, ci hc,edi
|ea||c|2|ed|

= cos(ea, c) cos(c,ed) = cos(ea, b) cos(b,ed) =

.

hea, bi hb,edi
|ea||b|2|ed|

to prove the last equality we use the following result, which is well-known in spherical
geometry:

lemma 2.2 let one of the dihedral angles of a three-edged piramid be a right angle. let
1, 2 and 3 be the plane angles at the vertex, and 3 corresponds to the face opposite to
the right dihedral angle. then

cos 3 = cos 1 cos 2.

the upper face of the central cube c (the face with edges tjt 

perpendicular to the front face (the face with edges t 
the lower face of c (the face with edges t 
(the face with edges tkt 

i xk) is
i xj). at the same time,
i xk) is perpendicular to the rear face
i xj). therefore, the above presented lemma implies

i xi and tjt 

i xi and tkt 

i xi and t 

i xi and t 

cos(ea, b) cos(b,ed) = cos(ea,ed) = cos(ea, c) cos(c,ed).

hence, the relation (2.11), and, consequently, compatibility of (2.5) for distinct i and j are
proved.

the denition of h

complete in the following sense. all the other scalar products of the edges can be expressed
through the scalar products from the minimal set, and therefore, through the functions h

proof. due to planar property of the lattice, tjxi is a linear combination of xi and xj, i. e.

tjxi = xi + xj.

are valid. here h

proof. let us express hxi, xji through the scalar products from the minimal set (2.3  2.5).
from the denition of darboux  egoro lattices it follows that 0 = hxi, tixji = hxi, xji 
hxi, xii + hxi, tjxii. in order to express the last term in the right hand side of this equality
through the minimal set, note that tjxi is proportional to the orthogonal projection d of
the vector x 

i on the plane spanned by xi and xj. therefore,

hxi, tjxii = hxi, x

|tjxi|

= hxi, x

htjxi, tjxii

we obtain

hxi, xji = |xi|2  hxi, x

|tjxi|2

.

direct substitution of (2.3  2.5) into the latter formula gives (2.15). formula (2.16) can be
proved in the same way.
(cid:3)

lemmas 2.3 and 2.4 imply constraints for the functions h

i (u). using the symmetry of

scalar product we get from (2.15) and (2.16) the equations:

ij (u) are discrete analogs of the rotation coecients (1.3) of at diagonal

ij (u).

relations (2.17) and (2.18) are discrete analogs of symmetry conditions for darboux 
egoro metrics. for n  3, there is another analog of symmetry conditions which can be
written in terms of the functions ij only.

lemma 2.5 let ij(u) be the discrete rotation coecients of darboux  egoro lattice. then
for each triple of pairwise distinct indices i, j, k the equation

(tkik) (tiji) (tjkj) = (tkjk) (tjij) (tiki).

(2.20)

is fullled.

proof. from (2.12) and denition of the discrete rotation coecients it follows that

hxi, xki = (tkik) 

h
k
tkh+
k

.

the desired relation can be obtained if we divide the equality hxi, xkihxj, xiihxk, xji =
hxj, xkihxi, xjihxk, xii by symmetric expression

.

of course, constraints (2.17) and (2.18) do not form a complete set of equations on the
discrete lame coecients. the main goal of the next section is to get such a set of equations.

(cid:3)

3 discrete analogs of the lame equations

just as in the continuous case the discrete analog of the lame equations can be obtained as
compatibility conditions of a system of linear equations satised by the edges x 
i (u) of the
lattice. these linear equations become simplier after an appropriate rescaling of the edges.

for each darboux  egoro lattice let us dene vectors y 

i (u) by the formulae

yi(u) =

1
tih+
i (u)

xi(u),

y 
i (u) =

1
i h
t 
i (u)

x 

i (u),

(3.1)

where h
vectors form biorthogonal system:

i (u) are the functions constructed in theorem 2.1. equation (2.4) implies that these

hyi, y 

j i = ij.

(3.2)

for further needs we write down some other scalar products which can be obtained from the
relations (2.3  2.5):

hyi, yii = 2

h
i
tih+
i

,

htiyi, yii =

h
i
tih+
i

,

htjyi, y 

i i = 1,

(3.3)

and (2.12, 2.15):

hyi, yji = 2

(itjh+

(titjh+

.

(3.4)

(the analogous formula can be written for hy 
i

, y 

j i.)

theorem 3.1 for any darboux  egoro lattice the vectors y 
equations:

i (u) satisfy the system of

i 6= j,

(3.6)

where the coecients 
formulae

ij (u) are dened by (2.19), and the coecients b

i (u) are given by

b+
i =

ij(tiji),

i =

xj6=i


ij (t 

i 

ji) .

(3.7)

proof. since the lattice is planar, the vector jyi (i 6= j) is a linear combination of yi and yj,
i. e. jyi = aijyi + dijyj. to nd the coecient aij, we take scalar product of this equation
with the vector y 
i i = 0. therefore,
i
jyi = dijyj. taking the scalar product of this equation and the vector yj we obtain

. using (3.2) and (3.3), we obtain aij = htjyi  yi, y 

hjyi, yji = dijhyj, yji = 2dij

h
j
tjh+
j

.

on the other hand, (3.4) implies

hjyi, yji = htjyi, yji  hyi, yji = hyi, yji = 2tj  ih+

j
tih+

i ! h

tjh+
j

j

.

comparison of the right hand sides of the two last equations yields dij = tjij. in the same
way we can prove (3.5) for the vectors y 
i

.

we will show now that yi(u) satisfy (3.6). for any u the vectors y1(u), . . . , yn(u) form a

basis of rn (since the lattice is non-degenerate). thus, there exists a decomposition

iyi = biyi +xj6=i

cijyj.

(3.8)

coecient cij can be found by taking the scalar product of this equation with the vector y 
j .
we get hiyi, y 

j i = cij. on the other hand

j i = cijhyjy 

hiyi, y 

j i = ihyi, y 

j i  htiyi, iy 

j i = tihyi, 

i y 

j i.

using (3.5), which has been just proved, we obtain

cij = hiyi, y 

j i = tihyi, (t 

i 

ji)y 

i i = 

ji = ij.

to determine bi(u), we multiply (3.8) by yi:

hiyi, yii = bihyi, yii xi6=j

ijhyi, yji.

(3.9)

plugging (3.3) and (3.4) into equation (3.9) we establish formula (3.7) for bi(u). the second
equation in (3.6) can be obtained in the same manner.
(cid:3)

the compatibility conditions of the linear system (3.5, 3.6) are discrete analogs of the
lame equations on the rotation coecients of the darboux  egoro metrics. our next
goal is to prove the inverse statement: any solution of these equations uniquely denes the
rotation coecients of some darboux  egoro lattice.

11

theorem 3.2 let functions ij(u), i 6= j, i, j  {1, . . . , n} (n  3), satisfy the relations
(2.20)

(tkik) (tiji) (tjkj) = (tkjk) (tjij) (tiki)

and the equations

kij = (tkik)kj,

i 6= j 6= k,

jvi = i(ji tjij),

i 6= j,

ijij + iij + jij = tjij(tjvi  vj) xk6=i,j

tj(ikkj),

i 6= j,

where vi(u) is dened by

vi = xp6=i

ip(tipi) .

then there exists a unique constant  such that the functions

are the rotation coecients of some darboux  egoro lattice.

eij(u) = (2)ujui1ij(u)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

equations (3.10  3.12) are equivalent to compatibility conditions of the linear system

ji = (tjij)j,

i 6= j,

ii = ( + vi)i xj6=i

ijj

(3.15)

(3.16)

where  is an arbitrary complex constant. the transformation (3.14) sends solutions of
(3.10  3.13) to the solutions of the same system and preserves the relations (2.20), since it
corresponds to the gauge transformation

of the linear system (3.15, 3.16). therefore, the theorem gives the necessary and sucient
conditions for the functions ij(u) to be the rotation coecients of some darboux  egoro
lattice, up to gauge transformation.

yi = ei = (2)uii

(3.17)

proof. unlike the continuous case, the problem of reconstruction the darboux  egoro
lattice from the functions ij requires a highly nontrivial choice of the initial data for the
solutions of system (3.5, 3.6). we x these data by dening the matrix of scalar products of
the corresponding vectors. in the next two lemmas we shall construct functions 
ij(u) by
means of which we shall later determine these scalar products.

12

lemma 3.1 let functions ij(u) satisfy the conditions (2.20) and (3.10 3.13). then there
exists a unique solution fi(u), i = 1, . . . , n, of the system

kfi = (tkik) (tiki)fi,

i 6= k,

(tiki)fi = (tkik)fk,

i 6= k,

(3.18)

(3.19)

normalized by the condition f1(0) = 1.

proof. system (3.18, 3.19) is over-determined, but we will show that it is equivalent to a
system of n compatible equations on the function f1(u). note, that equations (3.19) are
compatible due to (2.20).

first of all, let us prove the compatibility of a pair of equations (3.18) with distinct values
of the index k, say p and q. it suces to show that the following expression for pqfi is
symmetric with respect to p and q:

pqfi = hp(tqiq  tiqi)  tp(tqiq  tiqi) (tpip  tipi)ifi.

indeed, due to (3.10) the expression in brackets is equal to

[ . . . ] = tq(tpip  pq)(tiqi) + (tptqiq) ti(tpqp  pi)  (tptqiq) tp(tiqi  ip) (tipi) =

= (tqtpip)(tqpq)(tiqi) + (tptqiq) [titpqp  tpiqp] (tipi).

obviously, the last formula has the symmetry needed.

next, let us consider two equations (3.18) with distinct values of the index i (denote them
again by p and q). we shall show that one of them implies the other provided fp and fq
satisfy (3.19). indeed,

fq(cid:19) = k(cid:18) tqpq

tpqp

kfp = k(cid:18) tqpq
=(cid:18)tq(tkpk  kq) 
=(cid:18)(tqkq)(tkpk) 

fq

tktpqp

=

tpqp(cid:19) (tkqk) (tqkq) fq =

tpqp(cid:19) fq  tk(cid:18) tqpq
tp(tkqk  kp)  tk(tqpq  qk) (tqkq)(cid:19)
(tptkqk)(tpkp)(cid:19)

tktpqp

tqpq
tpqp

tqpq
tpqp

fq

.

now, (2.20) implies (tqkq)(tkpk)fq = (tkqk)(tpkp)fp. finally, we have

kfp =(cid:16)(tkqk)(tpkp)  (tptkqk)(tpkp)(cid:17)

fp

tktpqp

= (tkpk) (tpkp) fp,

which is the formula we need.

now let us consider equation (3.18) for 1fi, i > 1. plugging into both sides of this
equation the expression fi = i1f1, with i1 = (t1i1)/(ti1i), we obtain the equation of
the type 1f1 = fi(u)f1, where the function fi(u) is a rational combination of 1i(u) and
i1(u). in fact, the function fi(u) and, therefore, the equation on 1f1 do not depend on

13

the index i.
in order to prove that, we choose index j 6= i and consider equation (3.18)
for 1fj. it was shown at the second step of this proof that the substitution fj = jifi leads
to (3.18) for 1fi. on the other hand, substitution fj = j1f1 gives the equation 1f1 =
fj(u)f1. therefore, the equation 1f1 = fi(u)f1 can be obtained from 1f1 = fj(u)f1 by
substitution f1 = (j1)1jii1f1. but due to (2.20), (j1)1jii1 = 1jjii1 = 1, and we
conclude that fi(u) = fj(u) = f (u).

thus we obtain n equations on the function f1(u), namely, the equations

1f1 = f (u)f1,

if1 = (t1i1)(ti1i)f1,

i = 2, . . . , n.

(3.20)

it was already shown that the equations from the second group are compatible. to establish
compatibility of the equations 1f1 = f (u)f1 and if1 = (t1i1)(ti1i)f1, i > 1, it suces
to note that they are gauge equivalent to compatible equations 1fj = (t1j1)(tj1j)fj
and ifj = (tjij)(tiji)fj for any index j not equal to 1 and i.

summarizing all the facts, we see that the solution of system (3.183.19) can be obtained
as follows. first, we dene the function f1(u) from compatible system (3.20) with the initial
condition f1(0) = 1. then, using (3.19), we obtain all the other functions fi(u), i = 2, . . . , n.
then, as it was shown at the second step of the proof, all the equations of the system are
fullled. the proof of lemma is now complete.
(cid:3)

let us dene 

ii(u) by 

ii(u) = fi(u), i = 1, . . . , n, where fi(u) were constructed in the

previous lemma. for i 6= j we dene 

ij by the formula

note, that (3.19) implies 

ij(u) = 

ji(u).



ij = (tjij) 
jj,

j 6= i.

(3.21)

lemma 3.2 the above-dened functions 
tem of equations:

ij(u), i, j  {1, . . . , n}, satisfy the following sys-

j

ik = (tjij) 
jk,

j 6= i, k,

i

ij = (vi  1)

ij xk6=i

ik

kj,

i 6= j.

(3.22)

(3.23)

proof. lemma is proved by straightforward calculations. further in this proof we assume
that i 6= j 6= k. note, that lemma 3.1 and the denition of 

ii imply:

j

ii = (tjij)(tiji)

ii = (tjij)
ji.

now, by denition j
above established equalities and (3.10), we get

ki = j(tiki  

ii) = (tjtiki)j

ii  j(tiki)

ii. using the

j

ki = (tjtiki)(tjij)(tiji)

ii =

= (itjkj)(tiji)

ii  (tjtikj)(tiji)

ii = (tjkj)(tiji)

ii = (tjkj)
ji.

14

thus, we establish equations (3.22). let us prove (3.23). using (3.12), we obtain

j

ji = j(tiji  

ii) = (tjtiji)j

ii  (jtiji)

ii =

plugging into the last formula  + 1 instead of the shift operators t and applying (3.11) we
have

lemma is proved.

(cid:3)

the rotation coecients of the darboux  egoro metric satisfy the following condition:

pk kij = 0. our next goal is to prove the following discrete analog of this property.

lemma 3.3 let ij be a solution of equations (3.10  3.12), which satises (2.19). then it
also satises the following monodromy property:

et ij(u) = ij(u),

tk.

nyk=1

et =

(3.24)

proof. first of all, we prove by induction that if functions i(u) satisfy (3.15) then for any
set i of pairwise distinct indices i = {i1, . . . , is} the following equation holds:

(ti  1)j =xii

(tiji)i,

j / i,

ti = ti1 . . . tis.

(3.25)

indeed, if (3.25) is established for any set i of cardinality s, then for any k 6= j, k / i, we

15

have

(tkti  1)j = tikj + (ti  1)j = ti(cid:2)(tkjk)k(cid:3) +xii
= (titkjk)k + (titkjk)(cid:2)(ti  1)k(cid:3) +xii
= (titkjk)k +xii(cid:2)ti(tkjkji + ji)(cid:3)j =
= (titkjk)k +xii

(tktiji)i.

(tiji)i =

(tiji)i =

the last equality proves the step of induction and completes the proof of equation (3.25).
note, that the compatibility conditions for equations (3.15) and (3.25) lead to the following
formula for the long dierence derivatives i = (ti 1) of the discrete rotation coecients:

i jk =xsi

(tijs)sk,

j 6= k,

j, k / i.

let us also note, that as, due to (3.22), the functions 
same equations as i, we simultaneously prove the following equality:

ij for any index k 6= i, j satisfy the

i

jk =xsi

(tijs)

sk,

j, k / i.

(3.26)

equation (3.25) implies that

(cid:0)t (i)  1(cid:1) i =xj6=i(cid:0)t (i)ij(cid:1) j,

t (i) =yj6=i
since (et  1) = ti(t (i)  1) + i, applying (3.16) we gain the equality
((et  1)ij)j(u, ),

(et  1)i = ( + bi(u))i +

nxj=1

tj.

where bi(u) is some function whose explicit form is irrelevant now. since the vectors j are

linearly independent, it now suces to show that the vectors i and et i are parallel.

let us x an arbitrary point u0 and consider the solution i(u) = i(u; u0) of equations

(3.15, 3.16) with the following initial data at the point u0:

hj(u0), k(u0)i = 

jk(u0),

j, k = 1, . . . , n.

(3.27)

these relations dene the vectors i(u0) uniquely up to an orthogonal transformation of the
whole space.

let us prove by induction that relation (3.27) is satised at the point ui = ti1 . . . tisu0

for any set of pairwise distinct indices i = {i1, . . . , is} not containing j, i. e.

hj(ui), k(ui)i = 

jk(ui),

j / i.

(3.28)

16

suppose that i 6= j, k. then

ihj, ki = hij, ki + hj, iki + hij, iki =

= (tiji)hi, ki + (tiki)hj, ii + (tiji)(tiki)hi, ii.

if the induction hypothesis is true for the point ui and i / i, then we obtain the following
formula for the scalar product at the point tiui:

ihj(ui), k(ui)i = (tiji)

ik + (tiki)

ij + (tiki)(tiji)

ii =

= (tiki)

ij = i

jk

(3.29)

(all the functions in the right hand side are evaluated at the point ui). analogously, using
the induction hypothesis, we obtain

ihj, ii(ui) = (tiji)

ii + ( + vi)

+ (tiji)(cid:16)( + vi)

ii xk6=i

ik

kj +

ij pk6=i ik
ij xk6=i

ki(cid:17) = (vi  1)

ik

kj.

(3.30)

(again, all the functions in the rhs are evaluated at the point ui). comparing the rhs of
the last equality to the rhs of (3.23), we obtain:

ihj, ii(ui) = i

ji(ui),

j 6= i,

j / i.

(3.31)

equations (3.29) and (3.31) imply (3.28) at the point tiui.

we show that the vectors m(ui) and tmtj k(ui) with non-intersecting sets of indices
i, j  {1, . . . , n} are orthogonal provided m, k / i, m / j (m 6= k). according to (3.25),
we have

now we are ready to prove that the vectors i(u0) and et i(u0) are parallel. first,
hm(ui), tmtj k(ui)i = hm, ki +xjj

(tmtj kj)hm, ji + (tmtj km)hm, mi (3.32)

(all the functions in the rhs are evaluated at the point ui). we can apply formula (3.28)
to the scalar products in the rhs, so

hm(ui), tmtj k(ui)i = 

jm + (tmtj km)

mm =

(tmtj kj)

mk +xjj
mmtm(cid:16)j km xjj

= 

(tj kj)jm(cid:17) = 0.

this fact implies in particular, that the vectors

1(u0), t12(u0), t1t23(u0), . . . , t1t2 . . . tn1n(u0)

(3.33)

form an orthogonal basis. on the other hand, considering the sets of indices i = {1, 2, . . . , s},
m = s + 1, j = {s + 2, . . . , n} and k = 1 for s running from 1 to n  1, we establish

17

that et 1(u0) is orthogonal to all the vectors of this basis, but for the rst one. this implies
that the vectors 1(u0) and et 1(u0) are parallel. in the same manner we can show that the
vectors i(u0) and et i(u0) are parallel for i 6= 1. as it was noticed above, it implies that
ij(u0) = et ij(u0). as the choice of the initial point u0 was arbitrary, it completes the proof

of the lemma.

(cid:3)

the denition of 

ij and (3.24) imply that

corollary 3.1 there exists a constant 2 such that the following equations hold:

now we are ready to complete the proof of theorem 3.2.

ij = 2
ij.

et 

(3.34)

lemma 3.4 let functions ij satisfy the conditions of theorem 3.2 and let 2 be the cor-
responding bloch multiplier, dened by (3.34). then for  =   1 there exists a solution
i(u) of equations (3.15) and (3.16), satisfying relations (3.27) identically for u, i. e.

hj(u), k(u)i = 

jk(u),

j, k = 1, . . . , n.

(3.35)

proof. consider the solution i(u; u0) for some point u0. by denition of this solution, it
satises the relations (3.35) at the point u0. let us show that if these relations are satised
at the point u they are also satised at the point tiu. suppose, for instance, that i = 1.
while proving lemma 3.3 we have shown that at the point (t1u) equations (3.27) are satised
for all the pairs of indices except for (j = 1, k = 1). therefore, we only have to show that

|t11|2 = ht11, t11i = t1
11.

the fact that vectors (3.33) form an orthogonal basis implies that

|t11|2 =

ht11, 1i2

|1|2

ht11, t12i2

ht11, t1 . . . tn1ni2

|t1 . . . tn1n|2

(3.36)

analogously to the derivation of equation (3.30), we obtain:

ht11, 1i = (v1 +  + 1)

11 xj6=1

1i

i1 = ( + 1)
11.

(3.37)

from (3.28) it follows that

besides, repeating the proof of (3.32), we obtain

ht11, t12i = t1

12.

ht11, t1 . . . tii+1i = t1(cid:16) ixp=2

(3.38)

(3.39)

(to get the last formula in (3.39) we use (3.26)). plugging expressions (3.37  3.39) in (3.36),
we have

|t11|2 =

( + 1)2(

now, applying equations (3.21) and (3.22), we transform the last expression to the form

|t11|2 = ( + 1)2

therefore, we prove that i(u; u0) satisfy relations (3.35) in the positive octant with the
origin at u0.

0) and i(u; u

note, that the solutions i(u; u

0) coincide in the intersection of the cor-
responding octants up to a general orthogonal transformation. we kill this freedom by
xing the solution (u, 0) and choosing the initial conditions for i(u; u0) with any u0 so
that i(u, u0) coincides with i(u, 0) in the intersection of their domains. then the func-
tion i(u) = i(u; u) is a well-dened solution of system (3.15, 3.16) over the whole space,
satisfying conditions (3.35) for all u. lemma is proved.
(cid:3)

corollary 3.2 the above-constructed vector-functions i(u) satisfy the relation

htji(u), j(u)i = 0,

i 6= j.

(3.40)

let functions ij(u) satisfy the conditions of the theorem. we dene functions hi(u) as

a solution to the system

ihj(u) = ij(u)tihi(u),

i 6= j.

(3.41)

these equations are compatible due to (3.10). a solution of (3.41) depends on n arbitrary
functions of one variable, which are the initial data, i. e. functions hi(0, . . . , 0, ui, 0, . . . , 0).

let us consider vector-functions

xi(u) = tihi(u)i(u),

where i(u) were dened in the preceding lemma. equation (3.15) implies

jxi =(cid:18)ti

jhi

hi (cid:19) xi +(cid:18)tj

ihj

hj (cid:19) xj = ixj.

(3.42)

(3.43)

therefore, there exists a vector-function x(u) such that xi(u) = ix(u). due to (3.43) the
function x(u) denes the planar lattice which, according to (3.40), is a darboux  egoro
lattice.

to complete the proof of theorem 3.2 we only need to show that the functions ij(u) are

gauge equivalent to the rotation coecients of this lattice under transformation (3.14).

19

tion, correspond to the constructed lattice. equation (3.5) implies that xi satisfy the same

let ehi(u) be the lame coecients which, according to the results of the previous sec-
equation (3.43), where coecients depend on theehis instead of the his. therefore,

jhi

=

hi

.

jehi
ehi

plugging (3.42) into (3.16) and using (3.41), we obtain:

hence, hi = fiehi, where fi = fi(ui) depends only on the variable ui.
xj! .

tihi  ( + vi)xi xj6=i

ihj
tjhj

tixi =

t 2

equation (3.6) implies the same equality, where hi are replaced byehi and  by 1/2. therefore,

comparing the coecients of xj we see that fi = cui, where c is a constant. the comparison
of the coecients at xi denes this constant: c = (2)1. theorem 3.2 is proved.
(cid:3)

in the next section we present an algebro-geometric construction of a wide class of the
darboux  egoro lattices, which can be written explicitly in terms of the theta-functions of
auxiliary riemann surfaces.

4 algebro-geometric lattices

let 0 be a smooth genus g0 algebraic curve on which there is a meromorphic function
e(p ), p  0, with n simple poles and n simple zeros. let points p1, . . . , pn be poles, and

q1, . . . , qn be zeros of e(p ). consider the riemann surface  of the functionpe(p ). it

is two-sheeted covering of 0 with 2n branching points at the poles and the zeros of e(p ).
according to the riemann  hurvitz formula genus g of  equals g = 2g0 + n  1. let
 :    be the holomorphic involution of  which permutes sheets of the covering. the
points pi and qj are xed points of the involution.

i  0, i = 1, . . . , n, such that e(p c

the function e(p ) on 0 takes each value n times. let us x a constant c2 and consider

the points p c
is odd with respect to the involution , has simple poles at p1, . . . , pn and simple zeros at
i ) = p 
q1, . . . , qn. let p 
i .
i =  + 1 as a local

i ) = c2. the function  = c1pe(p )

i be preimages on  of the point p c
i =   1, as a local coordinate on  near p +
i . note that (w+

i ) = 1 and (p +

coordinate near p 

i . then (p 

we choose w+

i ) = w
i .

i and w

let us x an integer l  1 and two sets of points in the general position on . one
of them is a set of l points r = (r1, . . . , rl), and the other is a set of g + l  1 points
d = (1, . . . , g+l1). a pair of the divisors r, d is called admissible (see [14]), if there is a
meromorphic dierential d0 on 0 with the following properties:

projections of r on 0,  = 1, . . . , l;

(a0) d0 has n + l simple poles at qi, i = 1, . . . , n and at the points br, which are the

20

1, . . . , g + l  1.

(b0) the dierential d0 has g + l  1 zeros at the projections bs of the points s, s =

the dierential d0 may be considered as an even, with respect to , dierential on ,

where it has:

(a) n + 2l simple poles at qi, i = 1, . . . , n, and at the points r and (r),  = 1, . . . , l;

(b) 2(g + l  1) zeros at s and (s), s = 1, . . . , g + l  1, and simple zeros at the points

pi, i = 1, . . . , n.

the riemann  roch theorem implies that for each pair of divisors d, r in the general
position there exists a unique function (u, q|d, r), u = (u1, . . . , un)  zn, q  , such
that:

(1) (u, q|d, r) as a function of the variable q is meromorphic on . outside the
it has at most simple poles at the points of the divisor d (if all of them are

punctures p 
i
distinct);

(2) in the neighborhood of p 
i

the function (u, q|d, r) has the form

 = (w

i )ui  xs=0

s,(u)(w

(3)  satises the normalization conditions

(u, r|d, r)  1,

(4.1)

(4.2)

the function  is a discrete analog of the baker  akhiezer functions which are the core
of algebro-geometric integration theory of soliton equations. further on, we shall often
omit indication of its explicit dependence on the divisors d, r and will simply denote it by
(u, q). the discrete baker  akhiezer function can be expressed in terms of the riemann
theta-function in a way almost identical to the continuous case (see [14]).

the riemann theta-function, associated with an algebraic curve  of genus g is an entire

function of g complex variables z = (z1, . . . , zg), and is dened by its fourier expansion

(z1, . . . , zg) =xmzg
where b = bij is a matrix of b-periods, bij = hbi
tials j(p ) on : haj

of intersections: ai  aj = bi  bj = 0, ai  bj = ij.

e2i(m,z)+i(bm,m),

j, of normalized holomorphic dieren-
i = ij. here ai, bi is a basis of cycles on  with the canonical matrix

the theta-function has the following monodromy properties with respect to the lattice

b, spanned by the basis vectors ei  cg and the vectors bj  cg with coordinates bij:

(z + l) = (z),

(z + bl) = exp[i(bl, l)  2i(l, z)] (z)

where l is an integer vector, l  zg. the complex torus j() = cg/b is called the jacobian
variety of the algebraic curve . the vector a(q) with coordinates

ak(q) =z q

q0

k

21

denes the so-called abel transform:  7 j().

according to the riemann  roch theorem, for each divisors d = 1 + . . . + g+l1 and
r = r1 + . . . + rl in the general position there exists a unique meromorphic function r(q)
such that d is its poles divisor and r(r) = . it can be written in the form (see details
in [14]):

f(q) = (a(q) + z)q6= (a(q) + f)

m=1 (a(q) + sm)

,

let dj be a unique meromorphic dierential on , which is holomorphic outside p 
j ,

has simple poles at these punctures with residues 1, and is normalized by conditions

dj = 0.

it denes a vector v (j) with the coordinates

the baker  akhiezer function (u, q|d, r)) has the form:

theorem 4.1 the baker  akhiezer function (u, q) satises the equation

ij(u, q) = ai

ij(u)i(u, q) + aj

ij(u)j(u, q),

tjj

0,+

.

and s

0,+ is the leading coecient of expansion (4.1) of (u, q) near the puncture p +
s .

22

proof. from the denition of the coecients ai
ij it follows that the dierence of the right
and left hand sides of (4.3) satises the rst two dening properties of the baker-akhiezer
function. at the same time this dierence equals zero at the points r. the uniqueness of
the baker  akhiezer function implies then that this dierence equals zero identically.
(cid:3)

let 2

k = resqk d0. then we dene a lattice x(u) = (x1(u), . . . , xn(u)) by the formula

xk(u) = k(u, qk).

(4.4)

edges of this lattice are vectors xi(u), with coordinates (xi)k(u) = ki(u, qk). let us
dene also vectors x 
i (u, qk). evaluations
of (4.3), at the points qk, show that the above-dened lattice is planar.

i (u) by the formula (x 

i (xi)k = k

i )k = t 

in a generic case the vector function x(u) is complex. let us specify algebro-geometric

data that are sucient for getting real vectors.

suppose that on  there exists an antiholomorphic involution  , such that it commutes

with  and

 (d) = d,

 (r) = r,

 (qi) = qi,

 (p +

j ) = p +
j .

(4.5)

from the denition of d0 it follows that  d0 = d0. therefore, the residue 2
k of that dif-
ferential at qk is a real number. suppose in addition, that k is real (or 2
k is positive). from
(4.5) it follows that dening analytical properties of (u, q), coincide with the analytical
properties of (u,  (q)). uniqueness of the baker  akhiezer function implies then that these

functions coincide, i. e. (u,  (q)) = (u, q). hence, x(u) = k(cid:0)(q1, u), . . . , (qn, u)(cid:1) =

x(u), and therefore, the lattice constructed is a lattice in the real euclidian space.

lemma 4.1 let x 

i (u) be vectors, which are dened by the baker  akhiezer function. then

hxi(u), x 

j (u)i = ij (tih+

i (u)) (t 

i h

i (u)),

i (u) = ii

where h
coordinate w+
i

in the neighborhood of the puncture p +
i .

0,(u), and 2

i is the leading term of an expansion of d0 in terms of local

proof. let us consider the dierential

dij = ((q)  1) i(u, q) 

j (u, (q)) d0.

if i 6= j then that dierential has poles at qk, k = 1, . . . , n only. indeed, poles of (q)  1
at pk, k = 1, . . . , n, cancel with zeros of d0. at the points s and (s) poles of the product
i
j , cancel with zeros of d0. at the points r and (r) the poles of d0 cancel
with zeros of the product. at the points p 
k , k 6= i, j, the pole of one of the functions
i(u, q), 
j (u, (q)) cancel with the zero of the other one. the same is true for the
points p 
j , but at these points the
function (q)  1 has zeros.

j . the product i

j  has poles at p +

i and p +

i and p 

23

the sum of residues of a meromorphic dierential on a compact riemann surface is equal

to zero. therefore,

resqk dij =

nxk=1

nxk=1

ixk(u)  

j xk(u) = hix(u), 

j x(u)i = 0.

now let us consider the dierential

dii(u, q) = ((q)  1) i(u, q) 

i (u, q) d0.

it has additional pole at p +

i with the residue

resp +

i

dii = 2

i (tii

0,+) (t 

i i

0,),

which is equal to the sum of the residues at the punctures qk.

(cid:3)

summarizing, we conclude that the lattice dened by (4.4) is the darboux  egoro
lattice. in order to show a complete correspondence with the previous sections, let us nd
some other scalar products.

lemma 4.2 for scalar products of the vectors xi formulae (2.3, 2.5)

hxi, xii = 2(tih+

i ) h
i ,

htjxi, x 

i i = (titjh+

i ) (t 

i h

i ),

i 6= j,

where h

i = ii

0,, are valid.

proof. let us consider the dierential

d+

ii = i(u, q) i(u, (q)) d0.

it is meromorphic on  and has only simple poles at q1, . . . , qn, and at p 
i . therefore, the
sum of its residues q1, . . . , qn, which coincides with the left hand side of (2.3), is equal to
the sum of residues at p +

i , taken with the negative sign. we have

i and p 

resp +

i

which implies (2.3).

d+

ii = resp 

i

d+

ii = (tih+

i )(h

i ),

the proof of (2.5) is almost identical. it is enough to apply the same arguments to the

dierential

the lemma is proved.

d(1)

ij = tji(u, q) i(u, (q)) d0.

(cid:3)

now let us dene functions 

ij (u) and 

ij(u) by the formulae

+
ij =

ih+
j
tih+
i

,


ij =

j


i h
t 
i h

,


ij =

tihi

.

24

lemma 4.3 the functions 

ij (u) and 

ij(u) satisfy the equalities:

+
ij = 
ji,

ij = 

ji.

proof. above we have proved formulae (2.3  2.5) for the vectors xi and the functions h
i .
therefore, the statement of the lemma follows from the results of section 2. nevertheless,
we would like to show that it can be directly proved within the framework of the algebro-
geometric construction.

the dierential

d(2)

ij = (q) 

j (u, q) i(u, (q)) d0

has simple poles at p 
i only. the vanishing of the sum of its residues at these
punctures implies the rst equality of the lemma. to prove the second equality it is enough
to consider the residues of the dierential

j and p 

d(3)

ij = (q) j(u, q) i(u, (q)) d0,

which has only poles at p +

j and p +
i .

at the end, let us show that the functions

(cid:3)

i(u, q) =

1
tii

0,+

i(u, q)

satisfy equations which are gauge equivalent to (3.15) and (3.16). note, that the vector-
function i is uniquely dened by the following analytical properties:

(1) i(u, q) as a function of q is meromorphic on  and for each u the divisor of its

poles outside p 
i

is less or equal to d;

(2+) in the neighborhood of p +

j , the function i(u, q) has the form

i = (w+

j )uj 1 ij +

 j
s,+(u)(w+

j )s! ;

xs=1

(2) in the neighborhood of p 

j , the function i(u, q) has the form

i = (w

j )uj  xs=0

 j
s,(u)(w

j )s! ;

(3) i satises the normalization condition

i(u, r)  0,

 = 1, . . . , l.

theorem 4.2 the functions i(u, q) satisfy the equations:

ji(u, q) = (tjij(u))j(u, q),

i 6= j,

ii(u, q) = ( + vi)i(u, q) pj6=i ij(u)j(u, q),

25

where

ij(u) =

ij
tii

0,+(u)
0,+(u)

,

vi = xj6=i

ijtiji,

(q) =

1

(q)  1

.

proof. the proof of the theorem is standard. the dierence of the left and right hand
sides of the rst eqaulity satises the rst two properties which dene (u, q), and equals
zero at the normalization points. therefore, it equals zero identically. in the same way, the
dierence of the left and right hand sides of the second equation is proportional to ti(u, q).
the evaluation of this dierence at the normalization points shows that it is identically zero.
(cid:3)

the coecients ij, dened in the theorem are connected with the functions +

ij by the

gauge transformation

+
ij (u) =

j
i

ij(u).
