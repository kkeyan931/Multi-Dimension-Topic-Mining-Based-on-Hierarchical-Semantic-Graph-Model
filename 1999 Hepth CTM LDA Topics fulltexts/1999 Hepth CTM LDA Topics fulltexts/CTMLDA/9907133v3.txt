1/4 bps states and nonperturbative

couplings in n=4 string theories

abstract

we compute certain (2k + 4)point, oneloop couplings in the type
iia string compactied on k3  t 2, which are related to a topologi-
cal index on this manifold. their special feature is that they are sensi-
tive to only short and intermediate bps multiplets. the couplings de-
rive from underlying prepotentials g [2k+4](t, u ), which can be summed up
in the dual heterotic string on t 6,
the amplitudes describe nonperturbative gravitational corrections to k-
loop amplitudes due to bound states of vebrane instantons with heterotic
world-sheet instantons. we argue, as a consequence, that our results also
give information about instanton congurations in six dimensional sp(2k)
gauge theories on t 6.

1. introduction

bps-saturated string loop amplitudes [17] play an important role since they
can give exact non-perturbative answers for appropriate dual formulations of a given
theory. the corresponding pieces of the eective action are often given by holomor-
phic prepotentials, and it is this holomorphicity which underlies their computability.
particularly well-known are the couplings in n = 2 supersymmetric string compacti-
cations that describe gauge and certain gravitational interactions. they are character-
ized by holomorphic prepotentials fg [812], which can be geometrically computed via
mirror symmetry [13] on calabi-yau threefolds. an analogous holomorphic structure
arises also in certain eight dimensional string vacua [5].

however, a comparable systematic treatment for four dimensional string theories
with more, notably n = 4 supersymmetries has been lacking so far. the main novel
feature in n = 4 supersymmetry is the appearance of intermediate (1/4 bps) be-
sides the short (1/2 bps) supermultiplets. an example for a 1/2 bps saturated
amplitude is given by thr2i, which is perturbatively exact at one loop order in the
type iia string compactied on k3  t 2. it has been shown in [8,14,15] to be given
by the t derivative of:

the k3 apart from the 24 zero modes, the result is proportional to the topological
(t, u ) is precisely what counts the 1/2 bps

states in the theory.

in the dual heterotic string on the six-torus t 6, the type iia modulus t plays
the role [16,17] of the heterotic dilaton: t = shet. thus (1.1) represents a non-
perturbative result from the heterotic point of view, where the shet dependence reects
contributions from 1/2 bps vebrane instantons [14].

 the regularization constant is   8
33

e1e , where e is the euler constant. in the type iib

string on k3  t 2, it is the uderivative of this function what becomes relevant.

 1 

on the other hand, amplitudes sensitive to the intermediate, 1/4 bps states have
not yet been computed, at least as far as we know. it is the purpose of the present
paper to compute certain of such couplings at one loop order for type iia strings on
k3  t 2, and investigate their structure.

more specically, in the next section we will review some features of 1/4 bps
states in relation to the heterotic-type ii duality. in section 3 we will then discuss
(similar to refs. [7,15]) some facts about bps saturated helicity traces and their re-
lation to elliptic genera. in section 4 we will rst compute quartic couplings in the
moduli elds that are sensitive to the 1/2 bps states only; not surprisingly, their
structure turns out to be essentially the same as for the r2 coupling in (1.1). subse-
quently we will then compute certain sextic couplings, some of which will be sensitive
to 1/4 bps states. we will nd that these couplings are characterized by two prepo-
tentials g1(t, u ) and g2(t, u), which enjoy an intriguing factorization property. in
their structure they resemble borcherds-like sum formulas, with counting functions
given by the eisenstein series e2(q). in the subsequent sections we investigate these
prepotentials by rewriting them in various ways, and also obtain a generalization to
an innite sequence of (2k + 4)-point amplitudes.

finally, in the last section we will discuss the non-perturbative signicance of
these amplitudes when they are mapped by duality to the heterotic string. speci-
cally we will argue that the prepotentials carry non-trivial information about genus
k instantons on heterotic vebranes, and will also present some more speculative
remarks.

2. short and intermediate bps multiplets

we will consider n = 4 supersymmetric compactications of type iia super-
strings on k3  t 2, or equivalently, of heterotic strings on t 6. besides the graviton,
the bosonic content of the supergravity multiplet in n=4, d = 4 supergravity is a

 some works that deal with dierent but related issues discuss topological amplitudes for six
dimensional compactications of type iia strings [18], and the counting 1/8 bps states of
type iia on t 6 [19]. moreover, counting 1/4 bps states in 5d black holes has been considered
rst in [20].

complex scalar (the dilaton shet) and six gravi-photons. in addition we have 22 vec-
tor multiplets, which contain each six scalars and one vector. in terms of the heterotic
variables, the bosonic part of the action reads (up to two derivatives, see e.g. [21]):

this action is manifestly invariant under so(22, 6, ir) [22], while the equations of
motion show a further invariance under sl(2, ir) acting on shet. accordingly, the
local geometry of the scalar manifold is

the mass formula for 1/4 bps states on this space is [17,23]:

2p[mt(m + l)m][nt(m + l)n]  [mt(m + l)n]2i ,

(2.3)

which involves the electric (m) and magnetic (n) charge vectors. the sign is always
meant to be chosen such that mbp s is maximized. the degenerate case, in which
the square root vanishes, corresponds to the 1/2 bps states [21]. hence these may
be viewed as specializations of the more generic 1/4 bps states that accidentally
leave more supersymmetries unbroken.

we will consider in the following only the subspace spanned by shet, thet and
. on this subspace we have

uhet, so that the relevant moduli sub-space is(cid:0) sl(2,ir)

+ shet(n1 + n2uhet + p1thet + p2thetuhet)

(2.4)

+ shet(n1 + n2uhet + p1thet + p2thetuhet) .

one can check that in the degenerate case, |z+| = |z|, these central charges reduce
to the 1/2 bps mass formula [21]:

z = (q1 + q2shet)(m1 + m2uhet + k1thet + k2thetuhet) .

(2.5)

note that the shet-independent terms of (2.4) and (2.5) coincide, which implies that
the perturbative states are at least 1/2 bps and thus that the 1/4 bps states are
intrinsically non-perturbative from the heterotic point of view. that is, there is no
perturbative calculation in the heterotic string that could possibly see the 1/4 bps
states.

however, as noted above, the heterotic and type iia compactications are dual
to each other provided [16,25,17] we exchange: thet = s, shet = t and uhet = u .
inserting this into (2.4) and (2.5), we see that at least some of the 1/4 bps states
do have a perturbative description on the type iia side, though certainly not all of
them.

indeed we cannot expect to exactly compute the simultaneous dependence on all
three moduli s, t, u in perturbation theory, in whatever framework. but what we
can do is to simply focus on the t, u subspace on the type iia side, while going to
weak coupling, s  thet  i. in this limit, further non-perturbative corrections on
the type iia side are suppressed. even though this will not capture the full story, it
will capture at least some of the non-perturbative physics in the heterotic string that
is related to 1/4 bps states.

the relevant physical states we thus consider are tensor products of the states
on the k3 together with the momentum and winding modes on t 2, characterized by

(2.6)

these states are 1/4 bps if either the left- or the right-moving component is a ground
state [26,20,27], ie., nl = h(k3)
= 0, where nl,r denotes the
oscillator number and h(k3)
the mass of excitations on the k3. that is,
(suppressing any vacuum energy shifts) the level matching condition for bps states
reads

which exhibits the dyonic nature of the 1/4 bps states. clearly, the 1/2 bps states
correspond to both left and right moving ground states, and the level matching con-
dition is identically satised for the momenta (2.5) with ki = 0.

 4 

3. topological indices and n = 4 supersymmetry

oneloop amplitudes that are sensitive only to bps states must certainly very
special. indeed they must be proportional to certain helicity traces [26] (or gener-
alizations thereof), in which the long multiplets cancel out. a canonical example for
such a trace is given by [7]:

in order to recognize the saturation or vanishing of such traces more easily, it
is convenient to map them to the rr sector of the theory, in which this becomes a
simple question of saturation of fermionic zero modes. this map [28,29] is universal
for a given number of left- and right-moving supersymmetries and otherwise does not
depend on the background. for simplicity, we will write the relevant identity down
only for the left-moving variables, understanding that an analogous identity holds
independently also in the right-moving sector:

above, j (t 2) denotes the fermion number current in the t 2 sector and j (k3) the zero
mode of the u (1)  su (2) current of the n = 4 world-sheet superconformal algebra
that is intrinsic to a sigma-model on k3. from this it is easy to see that in the type
iia compactication on k3  t 2, we need at least two current insertions in each of
the left and right moving sectors in order to get a non-vanishing result.

 5 

there are however traces that are more general than the left-right symmetric
helicity trace in (3.1), and involve arbitrarily high powers of a current insertion in one
of the left- or right-moving sectors, for example:

respectively. like all elliptic genera, these are weak jacobi modular forms, namely of
weight 2 and index 1, and of weight 0 and index 1, respectively.

even more general traces can be obtained by inserting the individual fermion
number currents j (st)
independently. the generalized riemanm

era e(st)(bv(st), q), e(t 2)(bv(t 2), q) and e(k3)(bv(k3), q). as we will see, for the amplitudes

that we will consider, only one of those factors will be realized.

elliptic genera depend holomorphically on q, which reects that all non-zero
modes in the right-moving sector cancel out due to world-sheet supersymmetry. via
the identity (3.2) (which is due to space-time supersymmetry), this is simultaneously
a reection of the fact that the long multiplets cancel out in the trace, independent

 6 

of any deformations in the k3 moduli. while in fact the total number of bps states
may jump when varying the moduli, the weighted helicity sums count eectively net
numbers of bps states and so remain invariant. it is this index-like, topological nature
of bps saturated amplitudes what makes them special and their modular integrals
exactly computable [28,27].

more specically, for k = 0 only the (k3) = 24 left and right moving ground

states can contribute in the k3 sector, so that

b4 = (cid:10) (j (st)

gets only contributions from 1/2 bps states and this is what underlies the r2 coupling
(1.1) [14,15].

on the other hand, for k > 0 in (3.4) the states that contribute to the trace
consist of right-moving ground states and arbitrary left-moving states  from what
we said in the previous section, this precisely characterizes the 1/4 bps states. for
example, for k = 1 one has the following six-th order trace::

b6 = (cid:10) (j (st)

the issue is now to identify physical amplitudes that contain these building

blocks.

4. 1/2 and 1/4 bps saturated amplitudes

as a warmup, we study quartic interactions of the t and u moduli at oneloop

order in type iia compactied on k3  t 2:

hv1 (k1)v2 (k2)v3 (k3)v4(k4)i ,

i = t, u, t , u .

(4.1)

 which has previously been calculated in the z2 orbifold limit of k3 [15,7].

 7 

we want to extract from (4.1) the kinematical factor (k1k3)(k2k4) (and permu-
tations thereof), which corresponds to an oneloop corrections a to the term
(13)(24) in the eective action. these amplitudes receive non
vanishing contributions only from the n sn ssector and not from the rn s, n sr
and rrsectors. we thus consider insertions of the moduli vertex operators:

v (0,0)

v (0,0)

(k) = 2

: [z + i(ke)e(z)] [z + i(k)(z)] eikx (z,z) : ,
: [z + i(ke)e(z)] [z + i(k)(z)] eikx (z,z) : ,

in the zero ghost picture with z = pt2/2u2(x 4 + u x 5), z = pt2/2u2(x 4 +
u x 5),  =pt2/2u2(4 + u 5),  =pt2/2u2(4 + u 5). in this normalization
we have: h(z1)(z2)i,even =  (z12, )1(0, )
(0, )1(z12, ) , h(z1)(z2)i,even = 0, and for the
kinematics we consider, the only nonvanishing fermionic contractions are those that
lead to the helicity trace b4 in (3.7). however, from the bosonic contractions:

(4.2)

hz(z1, z1) z(z2, z2)i = p2
hz(z1, z1) z(z2, z2)i = prpl
hz(z1, z1) z(z2, z2)i = prpl
hz(z1, z1) z(z2, z2)i = |pr|2

(gb   ln||2), we have additional narain momentum insertions, whose contribu-
tions are crucial for modular invariance. the resulting modular integrals can be eval-
uated by using extensively the results of [32]. a typical example for a nonvanishing
amplitude is:

 the third correlator may also contain a function [31]. however, it would lead to manifestly

noncovariant amplitudes.

 some of these integrals have to be regularized with an irregulator. this is described in the

appendix of [32] and results in an extra constant contribution.

 8 

more generally, we nd that all the non-vanishing amplitudes are proportional to

(t, u ) (cf., (1.1)), which of course reects that the helicity trace b4 is sensitive

f (t 2)

1

only to 1/2 bps states.

now let us turn to more interesting scalar eld interactions at the sixth derivative

level. more specically, we consider the following type of amplitudes:

hv1 (k1)v2 (k2)v3 (k3)v4 (k4)v5 (k5)v6(k6)i ,

i = t, u, t , u

(4.5)

and focus on the kinematics for which each modulus i contributes one momentum
ki. this momentum structure can arise in three dierent ways: (i) fourfermionic
contractions on both sides, giving rise to the helicity trace b4, (ii) eight and four
fermionic contractions on the right- and left-moving sides, respectively, or (iii) four

and eightfermionic contractions on the right-moving and left-moving sides, respec-

tively.

the main technical issue is the evaluation of the modular integrals, which is not

entirely trivial and will be outlined in appendix a. performing these integrals, it turns

out that there are two types of nonvanishing results, one type displaying again only

1/2 bps states, the other however being sensitive to 1/4 bps states. as an example

for the rst type, consider

where  can be any of {t, u}. since it involves the eight fermion contraction of type

of types (ii) and (iii) that only 1/2 bps states contribute. an example is given by

even though the (suitable regularized) second derivative of the elliptic genus appears
, the integral involving e2 vanishes in a non-trivial

in the form of be2  e2  3
manner, so that basically only the nonharmonic part of be2 contributes  this means

that again only 1/2 bps and no 1/4 bps states contribute.

2

summarizing, the rst kind of sextic couplings has exactly the same 1/2 bps

structure as the quartic couplings discussed above.

on the other hand, in the following examples, where only one type of contraction

contributes (either of type (ii) or type (iii)), we see an interesting new structure

43 c(0), which is absorbed in ln((t )).

 the normalization of the vertex operators (4.2) is absorbed intoea.

 up to a term t2
 it is known [33] that some of the six-derivative couplings are related to the four-derivative ones
by eld redenitions. the similarity of the results in (4.7) and (4.4) may be partly related to
that. moreover, their kinematical structure coincides with some of the six-derivative couplings
that arise from expansions of born-infeld actions [34], and so may be also reproduced from
simple d-brane interactions.

saturated amplitudes, so they are exact up to one loop order (possible higher loop

and non-perturbative corrections are suppressed anyway in the limit that we consider,

importantly, what characterizes these amplitudes is a prepotential:

logarithms are dened by lia(z) =pp>0 zppa for a > 0 and lia(z) = (zz)|a| 1

moreover the sum runs over the positive roots k > 0, l  zz  k = 0, l > 0, and
the coecients are dened by:

xn

c(n)qn := e2(q)  1  24q  72q2 + . . . .

(4.12)

this must be the derivative of some combination of the elliptic genera in (3.6),

but because of the uniqueness of the quasi-modular form of weight two, it is un-
clear at this point of exactly which elliptic genus: e2 = 1
2e(k3)(v/2, q)|v=0 =
4e(stt 2)(v/2, q) e(k3)(v/2, q)|v=0. while the dis-

the generalization to (2k + 4)-point amplitudes.

note that since c(1) = 0, there is no singularity in the t, u moduli space and
this reects the impossibility of states becoming massless. note also that g1(t, u ) has
weight 2 under t and u duality, respectively, and indeed we nd that (4.11) and its

 it was the equality of these expressions that has been misleading us to some conclusions that

we have presented in a previous version of this paper.

(4.13)

these intriguing identities exhibit a factorization that is not manifest in (4.11). we

can furthermore obtain both of these prepotentials (and their complex conjugates) by

taking mixed derivatives of the following function:

h(t, u ) = 6 ln(t2|(t )|4)  ln(u2|(u )|4) ,

(4.14)

which in this sense appears to be a more fundamental function for the six-point
amplitudes we consider here. it is the analog of the 1/2 bps free energy f (t 2 )
(t, u )

in (1.1), the dierence being that the ln s are multiplied rather than added; by
adjusting possible integration constants we see that h(t, u ) is essentially the square
of f (t 2 )

(t, u ).

5. partition functions

the holomorphic prepotential (4.11) is one of the main results of this paper. its

appearance hints at the existence of a yet unknown superspace formulation of the the-

ory, in which it might gure as an eective lagrangian. it resembles the borcherds

type prepotentials that arise in other contexts [2,35,36,5], where non-negative poly-

logarithms appear instead. however, that dierence is not important and simply to

be attributed to the mass dimension of the couplings.

the structurally more profound feature is that g1(t, u ) intrinsically mixes the
kahler and complex structure sectors, and this is specically tied to the 1/4 bps



switching on all the moduli should promote ln(u2|(u)|4) to the logarithm of some

so(22, 6, zz) modular form.

states. indeed, when restricted to the subset of 1/2 bps states (which corresponds
to the terms with kl = 0), the sum in (4.11) nicely separates into decoupled pieces:

g1(t, u )

=

(5.1)

which in turn can be written manifestly in terms of the 1/2 bps spectrum using
[37,1]:

f (t 2 )

1

(t, u ) =  1

12 xm1n2n1m2=0

ln|pr|2 =  1

12 xm1n2n1m2=0

ln|pl|2 .

(5.2)

we thus explicitly see that the mixing terms in g1(t, u ) (or g2(t, u )) correspond
to the 1/4 bps states and originate from the presence of e2(q) (or e2(q)) in the
integrand. its eect is to shift the 1/2 bps level matching condition, |pl|2 = |pr|2,
to the 1/4 bps condition: |pl|2 = |pr|2 + kl (or |pr|2 = |pl|2 + kl).

using the product representation (4.13) and the well-known sum formulas of the
eisenstein series, we can represent the prepotentials in a form that generalizes the
1/2 bps sum (5.2):

piece

24 g2(t, u)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) holom.

with m1 = n2m2, m2 = n2m1, n1 = n1m2, n2 = n1m1. since there are in gen-
eral many dierent {mi, ni} that contribute to a given set {mi, ni}, the coecients
(mi, ni) are in general larger than one, and this must be so since otherwise the sums
would be counting (just like (5.2)) exactly the 1/2 bps states.

note that while f (t 2 )

(t, u ) has been written in (5.2) as a sum over 1/2 bps states
circulating in loops, it has also an interpretation in terms of world-sheet instantons

1

 14 

view-point is indeed more natural in the path integral formulation, where f (t 2 )

[8]; this is exhibited by the instanton expansion in the rst line of eq. (5.1). such a
(t, u )
is seen as counting holomorphic maps from a toroidal world-sheet into the target
space t 2.

1

the additional mixing terms proportional to e2ikt e2ilu , which are due to the
1/4 bps states, must have an analogous instantonic interpretation, however involving
holomorphic (and anti-holomorphic) maps that couple together both kahler and com-
plex structure sectors. such congurations can presumably be obtained via t -duality
from string networks [38,39], in which the 1/4 bps states have a simple geometric
representation.

6. generalization to an innite sequence of prepotentials

we will now discuss the generalization of the results of section 4 to (2k+4)point
amplitudes with k + 1 pairs of t and u moduli, besides one pair of moduli, (, )
with  = {t, u}. performing four-fermion contractions in the left-moving sector and
4k+4 fermion contractions in the right-moving sector, integrating over the location of
the vertex operators and subsequently applying the riemann identity (see appendix
b for some of the details), we eventually nd:

( t  u)k+1()

=

1

4z d2
2 x(pl,pr)(cid:16)|pr|2 
v(cid:17)2k+2he v2

the most harmonic part then evaluates to:

 by correctly identifying the variables, we can map the mass formula for (wrapped) triple string

junctions to the mass formula (2.6), ie., m 2
pi, qi are the charges of the i-th link of the junction, tpi,qi the corresponding tension and z
the central charges of (2.4). our results thus amount to counting such string junctions.

(6.5)

note that what appears here is the elliptic genus of the space-time sector times
t 2, and not the elliptic genus of k3 as one might have expected. this is indeed a bit
surprising, since the riemann identities typically mix all the internal and space-time
sectors (cf., (3.3)).

however, our amplitudes do not (as usual) amount to fermion number current
insertions, but to more complicated fermionic contractions, and the results of ap-
pendix b show that, in the net result, the elliptic genus of k3 happens to cancel out.
heuristically one may say that this is because our correlators probe only the t 2 sector
of the theory because they involve only t and u .

7. non-perturbative results for the n=4 heterotic string

so far we have been dealing with perturbative quantities in the type iia string
on k3  t 2. the interesting issue now is to map these via duality to the heterotic

 and as we had mis-stated in a previous version of this paper.
subsequent work [40] which deals with graviphoton amplitudes.

it does however appear in

string on t 6, by identifying [16,17]:

t = shet 
2
s = thet  bhet
u = uhet  (ghet

45 + iq|ghet|
45 + iq|ghet|)/ghet
where thet, uhet correspond to the two-torus in t 6 = t 4  t 2.

(7.1)

44 ,

the perturbative t -dependence that we have been computing before will thus
give non-perturbative information about the heterotic string. remember that we have
been suppressing non-perturbative corrections in the type iia string by going to weak
coupling, by sending s = thet  i. this corresponds to the decompactication
limit of the heterotic two-torus.

more specically, while the kaluza-klein modes (labelled by mi in (2.6)) re-
main kk modes in the heterotic string, the type iia windings around 1-cycles of
t 2 (labelled by ni) turn into magnetically charged wrapping modes of the heterotic
vebrane around 5-cycles in t 6. alternatively, one may imagine wrapping the ve-
brane rst around the sub-torus t 4, to yield a string in six dimensions that is dual to
the heterotic string [16,44,45,17,26]. the type iia windings ni are then the same as
the windings of this dual string around 1-cycles of the remaining t 2 on the heterotic
side. in total we thus have dyonic bound states of wrapped vebranes of charge mi
with kk modes of momentum nj, which are 1/4 bps if m1n2  m2n1 6= 0 and 1/2
bps if the dzw product vanishes. the windings and momenta are exchanged by
s-duality, which is a non-perturbative symmetry from the heterotic string point of
view, but a perturbative one from either the type iia string or from the heterotic
vebrane point of view [21,46].

however, in analogy to the type iia side, it is more natural to interpret the
prepotentials in terms of instanton series. quite generally, world-sheet instantons are
mapped under the duality to space-time instantons, and indeed contributions of the
form e2ikshet correspond [14] to gravitational vebrane instantons that arise from
winding the heterotic vebrane around the whole of t 6.

 since we are at a generic point in the narain moduli space, where there are no non-abelian
gauge symmetries, this is the neutral heterotic vebrane [4143] with zero size, or a small
instanton [26].

 17 

as far as the uhet dependence is concerned (which simply describes kk exci-
tations), it is actually more interesting to convert uhet  thet, by making use of
the thet  uhet exchange symmetry of the heterotic string. the purely thet depen-
dent terms then describe heterotic world-sheet instanton contributions, and the mixed
terms in the prepotentials

must therefore be due to bound states or superpositions of vebrane instantons with
world-sheet instantons. in particular, the remarkable factorization property (4.13) of

= 

(7.3)
tells us that the vebrane and world-sheet instanton sectors that contribute to these
couplings must be essentially independent.

in fact, by investigating the dependence on the coupling constants we nd that
the prepotentials g [2k+4]
correspond to non-perturbative corrections to (2k+4)-point
amplitudes at k-loop order in the heterotic string, so that the world-sheet instantons
are of genus g  k. 

1

note that world-sheet instantons on top of a vebrane can also be viewed as
gauge instantons in the world-volume theory of the vebranes [47]. more specically,
it is known that a stack of q5 = k heterotic vebranes has sp(2k) gauge symmetry
[26,48]. accordingly it has among other terms:

z d6x(cid:16) b  tr

sp(2k)

f  f +

g5br

tr

sp(2k)

f 2(cid:17)

on its world-volume, the rst term being necessary for anomaly cancellation [49].
it is known [16,17] that the space-time coupling of the t 4-wrapped vebrane (or

 the prepotentials g[2k+4]

are thus analogs of the well-known prepotentials fg that arise (in
n = 2 supersymmetric theories) at one-loop order in the heterotic string but at g loops on
the type ii side [8,9,10,12].

 18 

1
g5br

2 =p|ghet|. comparing to (7.1), we thus see that a charge q1 = l

dual string, that is) is equal to the world-sheet coupling of the fundamental string,
which means:
instanton on top of a charge q5 = k vebrane will give an additional factor of e2ilthet
besides e2ikshet , and this is what nally gives a particularly interesting physical
interpretation of the shet  thet mixing terms in (7.2). moreover the instantons must
break one-half of the supersymmetries on the vebrane, so that the total conguration
has only 1/4 unbroken supersymmetries.

something non-trivial may then be learned for these gauge theories from the nu-
merical values of the coecients of the mixing terms in (7.2). in analogous situations
such coecients count either isolated instantons, or euler numbers of the moduli
spaces if the instantons are not isolated. most likely the coecients mean something
similar here too, and in particular c[2k+4](kl) should carry information about the coho-
mology of moduli spaces of charge l, genus k instantons in the sp(2k) gauge theories
on t 6 (the exchange symmetry in k and l would relate this to charge k instantons in
sp(2l) gauge theories). we hope to present a more complete discussion elsewhere.

where fk(q) =pn

d(m)qm are modular functions of weights k, l,
respectively, and the integers obey r, s  0, q1, q2, q3, q4  0. modular invariance of
the integrand requires:

c(n)qn and gl(q) =pm

q1 + q2  r + s + k = 0
q3 + q4  r + s + l = 0 .

(a.2)

the integral (a.1) can be performed with the orbit decomposition method of [50]. in
the following we will discuss only the nondegenerate orbit i1, as the degenerate orbit
has already been evaluated in ref. [32].

in the same reference, the nondegenerate orbit i1 with gl(q) = 1, fk(q) 6= 1
has been worked out as well. a general feature of i1 is that the t and u moduli
always appear in pairs in the poly-logarithms that are either completely holomorphic
or anti-holomorphic, i.e., either (t, u ) and/or (t , u ) appear.

before we go to the general case, let us discuss the example fk(q) = 1, gl(q) 6= 1,

which is in fact what we need in section 4:

the presence of a holomorphic function gl(q) (which is in contrast to the usually con-
sidered situation) has as consequence that now mixed holomorphic/anti-holomorphic
pairs of moduli appear in the arguments of the poly-logarithms, i.e., (t, u ) and/or
(t , u ). after introducing

the last equation represents the result for the nondegenerate orbit of (a.1). we see
that the amount of holomorphic/antiholomorphic mixing is determined by m = nkl
and is absent for m = 0. this reects in our context that 1/4 bps states can mix
holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors, in contrast to the 1/2 bps states.

about elliptic genera of section 3, and of course a reection of the fact that only 1/4
bps states contribute.

we therefore expect (b.1) to be given by a (2k + 2)fold derivative of an elliptic
genus, and by considering modular invariance we see that this genus should be a
jacobi form of weight 2. there are only two natural candidates for it, namely either
the total elliptic genus

e(v1, v2, q) = e(stt 2)[ 1

2 (v1 + v2), q] e(k3)[ 1

2 (v1  v2), q]

i1[ 1

2 (v1 + v2), q]

i1[ 1

2 (v1 + v2), q]

=

3(q)

3(q)

e(k3)h 1

2 (v1  v2), qi ,

(b.2)

or just only the weight 2 factor of it, which is e(stt 2).

to x this ambiguity, our strategy will be to do the fermion contractions in (b.1)
for a few values of k, integrate these and sum over the spin structures, and then
compare the results with the two candidate genera.

to deal with the fermionic contractions, we rst decompose the correlator (b.1)

into a product of n twopoint functions:

hi(z1)j(z2)i = ij (z12,  )1(0,  )

(0,  )1(z12,  )

.

(b.3)

there are in general many of such partitions, and denoting contractions hi(zi)j(zj )i
by (ij), the pattern looks like:

[2, 2, 2 . . . , 2, 2]  (12)2(34)2 . . . (n  1, n )2 ,
[2, 2 . . . , 2, 4]  (12)(23)(34)(41)  (56)2 . . . (n  1, n )2 ,

...

...

...
[n ]  (12)(23)(34) . . . (n 1) .

...

(b.4)

note that these contractions form cycles, and the idea is to perform the integrations
and spin structure sums just for one (canonically ordered) representative of each cy-
cle class, p (above, the cycle class is indicated on the left). indeed, as the ordering
of the positions zi inuences the ziintegrations in (b.1), each cycle class in (b.4)
will in general lead, after integration, to a dierent modular function gp
 (q). subse-
quently will then need to multiply the result for each cycle class with the appropriate
combinatorial factor.

 22 

moreover, we need to sum over the spin structures , which amounts to folding
the gp
 (q) into the rightmoving part of the partition function, which then yields new
functions gp (q). we nd it easiest to write this map in terms of a zzn orbifold limit
of the k3:

gp (q) = x(h,g)6=(0,0)

(q)6

h 1+h
1+gih 1h

1gi x(,)

gp

 (q) 2h 

i(q)h   h

  gi(q)h  + h

 + gi(q) ,

(b.5)
taking all this together, we see that (b.1) may be written in the following way:

x z dz1 . . .z dzn hi1 (z1)j1 (z1) . . . in (zn )jn (zn )i

= (22)n1n xcycle

classes p

np gp (q) ,

(b.6)

where np denote the combinatorial factors that count the number of permutations in
(b.4).
let us now compute the (quasi)-modular forms gp for some low values of n  2k +2:
4 fermion contractions (n = 2): there is only the possibility (12)2, which yields:

g[2]
 ( ) =

1
3

(e2 + e) ,

where e(q) = 24q d

dq ln (q)  e2(q). inserted in (b.5), this gives:

g[2] = 12 .

(b.7)

(b.8)

8 fermion contractions (n = 4): there are two possibilities, namely, (i) (12)2(34)2
and (ii) (12)(23)(34)(41) which integrate to

g[2,2]


( ) =

g[4]
 ( ) =

1
32 (e2 + e)2 ,
1
(e4  e2
) ,
9

(b.9)

 correlators similar to (b.1) appear in n gauge boson amplitudes with fermionized currents. in
that case the combinations (b.4) correspond to the dierent invariants (trf 2n)m , 2nm = n,
which arise in the decomposition of the n gauge boson amplitude. for n = 4 this has been
studied before in the literature [51].

 we perform the calculation in an zz2 orbifold limit of k3. however the calculations can be

easily generalized to zzn orbifold limits along [52].

 23 

respectively. inserting into (b.5) leads to:

g[2,2] = 8e2 ,
g[4] = 0 .

(b.10)

in the following we will explicitly display the spin-structure dependent correlator only
for the last combination in (b.4), namely g[n]
 (q), as the others are combinations of
correlators with less fermions.

12 fermion contractions (n = 6): the chain (12)(23)(34)(45)(56)(61) gives after the

 we remark that while the last type of contractions leads to a vanishing result for k3  t 2

(b.18)

in order to assemble these modular functions into (b.6), we still need to nd
the combinatorial factors np . for this we employ a graphical method, somewhat
indeed all
similar in spirit to that what was used in the second reference of [51].

 25 

the contractions can be represented by graphs, which can be labelled by their cycle
structure.

more precisely, we need to consider graphs with two kinds of vertices, one kind
referring to the moduli t and the other to the moduli u . that is, the rst kind
of vertices correspond to operators (k  ), while the second kind corresponds to
(k  ). charge conservation for ,  and the kinematical structure of the form
(t u )k+1 then implies that only contractions between the two sets of vertices
are allowed; furthermore the contractions must form loops made from alternating
sequences of  and  propagators  see the gure.

[2,2,2]:   -6

[2,4]:  +18

[6]:     -12

fig.1: bipartite graphs relevant for k = 2. each point on the
left of a diagram corresponds to an operator (k  ), while on the
right it correspond to (k  ). each loop has to be counted twice,
reecting the two ways to assign to it an alternating sequence of 
and  propagators. the cycle structure also determines the signs.

such bipartite graphs are characterized by incidence matrices of the block from

i = (cid:18) 0 r
0(cid:19)

rt

where r =pi,j(ri + rj) and where {ri} are all the permutations of the columns of

the n/2 = k + 1 dimensional identity matrix. clearly there are in total ((k + 1)!)2
such graphs. each of such graphs needs now to be classied with respect to its cycle
structure, which also determines its sign (given by the signature of the permutation).

being pragmatic, we generated these graphs up to n = 12 with mathematica
(which gives a formidable number), and decomposed them in terms of their cycle

 26 

structure. in this way, we obtained the following list of combinatorial coecients:

n = 4 :

n = 6 :

n = 8 :

n = 10 :

n = 12 :

n[2,2] = 2, n[4] = 2
n[2,2,2] = 6, n[2,4] = 18, n[6] = 12
n[2,2,2,2] = 24, n[2,2,4] = 144,
n[4,4] = 72, n[2,6] = 192, n[8] = 144
n[2,2,2,2,2] = 120, n[2,2,2,4] = 1200, n[2,4,4] = 1800,
n[2,2,6] = 2400, n[4,6] = 2400, n[2,8] = 3600,
n[10] = 2880
n[2,2,2,2,2,2] = 720, n[2,2,2,2,4] = 10800, n[2,2,4,4] = 32400,
n[2,2,2,6] = 28800, n[4,4,4] = 10800, n[2,4,6] = 86400,
n[2,2,8] = 64800, n[6,6] = 28800, n[4,8] = 64800,
n[2,10] = 103680, n[12] = 86400.

inserting these together with our expressions for the gp (q) into (b.6), then pro-
duces combinations of eisenstein series that exactly match the following derivatives
of e(stt 2)(v, q):

np (k)gp

(k)(q) = (cid:16) 

v(cid:17)2k+2(cid:18)i1( 1

xcycle

classes p

2 v, q)

3(q) (cid:19)2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) v=0

,

for k = 0, . . . , 5. by the uniqueness of the jacobi forms this makes clear what the
relevant elliptic genus is, and in particular that the elliptic genus of k3 cancels out.
