(2.1) wish construct n = 1 supereld action also invariant respect one extra spontaneously broken = 1 supersymmetry. thus basic objects superelds given n = 1, = 1 superspace coordinates {t, } , (t = t, = ) 1 let us dene fermionic bosonic superelds (t, ) v(t, ) related 1 2dv , spinor covariant derivative = ( = , v = v) , = + , {d,d} = 2t . (2.2) (2.3) 1henceforth, use following convention evolution parameter action: = = is, standard real time action. 2 introduce additional, arbitrary moment, real spinor supereld (t, ) becomes possible realize extra n = 1, = 1 supersymmetry spinors . assuming second supersymmetry spontaneously broken, linear transformation laws written = (1 d) , = . (2.4) presence constant shift transformations (2.4) means spontaneous breaking supersymmetry suggests interpretation goldstone fermionic supereld accompanying linear realization breaking. one check gener- ator transformations (2.4) forms n = 1, = 1 superalgebra {s, s} = 2p (2.5) anticommutes generator q manifest n = 1 supersymmetry (2.1) given realization.2 however, (2.4) one also extract transformation law scalar supereld v: v = 2 ( ) , = 1 2 tv . (2.6) now, brackets manifest second n = 1 supersymmetries yield constant shift supereld v, means central charge z appears anticommutators two n = 1 supersymmetries v bosonic goldstone supereld associated broken central charge transformations {q, s} = 2z . (2.7) thus, long limit attention goldstone fermionic supereld only, full supersymmetry algebra given (2.1), (2.5) need central charge. imposing relation (2.2) introduces active central charge (2.7) v corresponding goldstone supereld. shall see soon, options lead pbgs theories dierent physical elds contents. let us note eld good candidate lagrangian density. indeed, integral manifestly invariant respect rst n = 1 supersymmetry. also invariant respect second supersymmetry integrand shifted spinor derivative variation (2.4). 2we stress hereafter superalgebras deal supereld variations. sucient consider aim constructing invariant actions. superalgebras charges supercharges constructed pbgs actions nother procedure dierent: inevitably include constant central charges crucial evading  famous wittens no-go theorem . particular, central charge appear shift p r.h.s. anticommutator (2.5) generators spontaneously broken supersymmetry. central charges produce transformation elds, opposed another, active sort central charges generate actual symmetries heavy use throughout paper. 3 =z dtd (2.8) supereld regarded independent, action (2.8) course meaningless. becomes meaningful expressing terms goldstone supereld . performed covariant way, resorting method . rst step one nds nite transformations second supersymmetry basic superelds , case hand coincide (2.4). next, one introduces goldstone fermion nonlinear realization following transformation law second supersymmetry: = + .

(2.22) (2.23) (2.24) (2.25) again, due explicit presence , (2.23), brackets manifest second n = 2 supersymmetries yield constant shift supereld , therefore central charge z appears anticommutators two n = 2 supersymmetries 4 ns, = p , n q, = 2z . eld treated lagrangian density action nq, = 2z , =z dtd2 manifestly invariant respect n = 2 supersymmetries. express terms goldstone superelds , use method  previous subsection. nite transformations second supersymmetry basic superelds , , easily computed = (cid:16)1 dd(cid:17) + = + (cid:18)1 + 1 2 , 1 2hd, di (cid:19) . = (cid:16)1 + d(cid:17) , 1 2 (2.26) one introduces goldstone fermions nonlinear realization , following transformation laws second supersymmetry: = + 1 2 ( + ) , = + 1 2 ( + ) , (2.27) 4this multiplet = 1 reduction chiral n = 1 , = 4 multiplet. 6 substitutes (,) parameters (, ) r.h.s.

(3.1) (3.2) form following algebra {q, q} = 2p , nsi, sjo = 2ijp , nq, sio = 0 . fermionic n = 1, = 1 superelds contain bosonic degrees freedom physical dimension. since wish superparticle model, world-line scalar n = 1 multiplets containing bosonic elds, led introduce bosonic superelds vi = 1 2dvi , (cid:16) = , vi = vi(cid:17) . transformation properties extracted (3.1) : vi = 2i ( ) + ijkjdvk , = 1 2 itvi . (3.3) (3.4) like n = 4 n = 2 case, due explicit presence transformations (3.4), anticommutators manifest q spontaneously broken si supersymmetry generators acquire active central charges z right-hand side. finally, basic anticommutation relations extracted supereld variations read {q, q} = 2p , nsi, sjo = 2ijp , nq, sio = 2z . (3.5) 9 central charge generators act pure shifts vi, suggesting interpretation vi goldstone superelds parametrizing transverse directions four-dimensional space z i, p act translation operators. surprisingly, superalgebra (3.5) cannot interpreted dimensional reduction standard n = 1 poincare superalgebra = 4, z i, p components full 4- momentum. moreover, also cannot recovered one - two-central charges extension = 3 = 2 poincare superalgebras relevant lorentz groups (so(1, 2) sl(2, r) so(1, 1)) automorphism ones. indeed, automorphism group (3.5) so(3) respect odd even generators split singlet triplet. nevertheless, still possible interpret (3.5) dimensional reduction language. one proceed standard n = 1, = 4 super poincare algebra, extension tensorial central charges . generators z turn partly come central charges partly extra components 4-momentum. precise correspondence given appendix. let us turn issue constructing invariant action system consideration. like previous case (sect. 2), use (v) lagrangian density, sv =z dtd(v) , (3.6) view transformation property (3.1). main question covariantly express terms and, further, vi. one could use method previous section. however, turns present case easier perform direct construction . idea construction rather simple. case hand one non- nilpotent bosonic dimensionless object x = didi. therefore general ansatz supereld contain arbitrary functions x only. moreover, unique objects positive (one half) dimension (in length units) spinor superelds i. allows one write general ansatz = idia + 2ii tdjc + ii tjdje tb + 2idij dig , tdif + 32i +3di (3.7) a, b, . . . , g yet undetermined functions x, use following notations = ti , 2i = ijkjk , 3 = ijkijk .
