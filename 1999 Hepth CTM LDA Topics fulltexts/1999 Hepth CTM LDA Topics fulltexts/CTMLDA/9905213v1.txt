motivated by the debate of possible denitions of mass and width of resonances for z-boson
and hadrons, we suggest a third denition in addition to those given by a renormalization scheme
of perturbation theory and a rst order pole of s-matrix theory.
it denes unstable particles
by minimally complex semigroup representations of the poincare group characterized by (j, s =
(m  i/2)2) in which the lorentz subgroup is unitary; wigners representations (j, m) are the
limit case for  = 0. these representations have generalized vectors (gamow kets) with all the
properties that heuristically the unstable states need to possess : a breit-wigner invariant mass-
squared distribution, a lifetime  = 1
 dened by the exactly exponential law for the decay probability
p(t) and rate p(t) given by an exact golden rule which becomes diracs golden rule in the born-
approximation; and an s-matrix pole at s = (m  i/2)2. in addition and unintended, they have
an asymmetric time evolution.

the meaning of unstable elementary particles and/or resonances  in particular in the relativistic domain  has
always been a subject of controversy and debates which are-up whenever new phenomena compel us to re-examine
our old ideas and prejudices. recently it was the line shape of the z-boson in the analyses of the lep and slc
data of ee  f f (+n) that gave rise to the revision of old ideas. two dierent approaches have been used in the
determination of the line shape and the denition of the line shape parameters [1,2]. the rst and popular approach,
which practically all experimental analyses of the lep and slc data follow [3] is based on the on-shell denition
of mass mz and width z. mass and width are dened in perturbation theory by the self-energy of the z-boson
propagator. the on-shell denition of mass and width denes the (real) mass mz as the renormalized mass in the
on-shell renormalization scheme by the real part of the self-energy. this choice of mz as the mass of the z is arbitrary.
the s-dependent width z(s) (which is not a parameter of the standard model but derived) is given by the imaginary
part of the self-energy in terms of the parameters of the standard model and mz, and thus suers from the same
degree of arbitrariness. in this on-shell approach, the (radiation corrected) cross sections around the z peak are tted
to a breit-wigner amplitude with energy dependent width given by

aj(s) = 

spe(s)f (s)
z + isz(s)
s  m 2

,

where

e, f (s)

= constant, z (s) =

z, z = z(mz ).

once the arbitrariness of the on-shell renormalization scheme [46] and its problems with gauge invariance of mz
and z [7,8] were realized, a second approach to the z-boson line shape was suggested. this was based on the
s-matrix denition of the mass and width for an unstable particle with spin j by the position sr = (mr  i/2)2
of the resonance pole on the second sheet of the j-th partial s-matrix element. with this denition, the j-th partial
amplitude for the z-boson is again given by a breit-wigner amplitude

but  and mr are now the xed basic s-matrix parameters, independent of the energy s or a particular renormalization
scheme. according to the results of references [5,6] the two denitions dier in value by an amount exceeding the
experimental error :

there are other channels in addition to the z-channel to which the initial and nal state of the lep experiment
can couple, e.g., the photon channel and additional channels of which the phase shifts are assumed non-resonant. this
means we have a double multichannel resonance [9] with background

ee

(5)

the partial wave amplitude is a superposition of the z-boson breit-wigner (3), the -breit-wigner and a slowly
varying background amplitude b(s) (constant in the z energy region) :

aj(s) =

rz

(6)

with the amplitude (6), the s-matrix approach and the standard model (on-shell) approach using (1) led to similar
formulas for the total cross section and the asymmetries, except for the energy independence of the width  in the
s-matrix approach [1]. these formulas in both approaches contain the z-breit-wigner, the photon term (-breit-
wigner) and the z interference term which is important for the ts of various asymmetries. fits of these formulas
for the two dierent approaches to the experimental cross sections and asymmetries were equally good. they led
to equally accurate tted values for mass and width in both approaches, which diered by the expected mass shift
(4) [1,10,11]. the experimental data for the z-boson can not discriminate between the two dierent denitions of the
z-mass and width.

theoretically, the on-shell denition of the standard model [12] and the pole denition of the s-matrix theory [13]
are worlds apart. in the latter case, the resonance is an elementary particle characterized (in addition to its spin j
(and internal or channel or resonance species quantum numbers)) by the complex number sr, and diers from the
corresponding denition of a stable particle (bound state pole) just by a non-zero complex part [13]. in the former case,
the resonance is a complicated phenomenon which cannot be dened by a number, real or complex. theoretically, the
s-matrix denition has the advantage of gauge invariance. the requirement of gauge invariance would disfavor the
on-shell denition of mz. but, besides the on-shell renormalization scheme, there are other renormalization schemes,
including the one based on the complex valued position of the propagator pole [8], and many more dierent from the
pole position which despite lead to gauge invariant (m





z, 

z)s [14].

the denition of resonance mass and width in (perturbation theory of) the standard model remains ambiguous
unless we add some further stipulations like e.g., the association to the pole of the s-matrix. it appears that after the
above reviewed developments the popular opinion has changed in favor of the second denition of m and . however,

2(cid:1)2
even for the s-matrix denition by the complex number sr =(cid:0)mr  i 

and width of the z resonance are not independently dened 1. we will give in this paper a third denition which
does.

the insight acquired from the investigation of the line shape problems of the z-boson also inuenced the ideas
about hadron resonances [15]. the conventional approach [3] for hadron resonances has also been to parameterize
the amplitude in terms of a breit-wigner (1) with energy dependent width h(s) (which is not as simple as (2) but
depends upon the model used for the energy dependence and the denition of mh). however there has been an ongoing
pole-emic in favor of the s-matrix pole denition of hadron resonances [16] and the recent editions of reference [3]
list for the baryon resonances like the 33 the values of the conventional parameters mh(= 1232 mev for ) and

conventional one based on (1) and the s-matrix approach based on (3), were applied to the -meson data [15,17]
and compared with each other, the conclusion was that the s-matrix denition of m and  is phenomenologically
preferred. the reason given was that these tted parameters remained largely independent of the parameterization of
the background term b(s) and the  interference. a similar t to the s-matrix breit-wigner (3) was performed for
the experimental data on p scattering in the  resonance region [18]. again the tted values for the pole denition
(3) of mr and  are independent of the background parameterization and signicantly smaller than the conventional
values from (1). the interpretation of [16] is that the pole position sh belongs to the -resonance whereas the
conventional parameters (mh, (mh)) belong to the  together with a large background.

the problem in all these experimental analyses is to isolate the resonance from the background b(s) (background
phase shifts from other channels and other partial waves) and from resonances in other channels. this is a practical
problem due to the initial and nal state photonic corrections and the apparatus resolution, but it is also a problem
of principle because even the unfolded basic cross sections 0 may contain interference with some background.
one can make the argument that in principle an unstable microphysical state cannot be isolated by a macroscopic
apparatus. the in-state that one prepares + is a superposition (at ideal) of a resonance state g and a background
bg: + = g + bg [19]. the resonance state g is elementary and characterized  in addition to the spin jr  by
a complex mass, sr = (mr  i/2)2, g = g
jr sr, in the same way as the stable state is characterized by spin j and
real mass-squared m2, jm, but bg is something complicated that changes from experiment to experiment.

for stable elementary particles we have a vector space description dened by the irreducible representation spaces
of the poincare group p [20] (from which we then can dene the asymptotic elds [21]). this denition has so far no
counterpart for the unstable relativistic particles. the z-boson is fundamental, but it is not dened as an elementary
particle in the sense of wigner, unless its width ( z

in order to consider the z-boson as an elementary particle in the wigner sense, we want to give in this paper a third
denition of an unstable particle and its mass mr and width . the state vectors of an unstable particle g
jsr are
by denition elements of a representation space of the poincare group p. these representations of p are minimally
complex representations in which the lorentz subgroup is unitary. they are characterized by the numbers (j, sr)
mr(cid:17)2(cid:19) imr is a complex number with

the stable elementary particle with spin j and mass mr.
2(cid:1) of the space-time symmetry group p is intimately connected

with the second denition by the pole of the j-th partial s-matrix element at s = sr. in fact we will dene g
jsrs
as the eigenkets of the self-adjoint, invariant mass squared operator pp  with complex eigenvalue sr which are
connected with the s-matrix pole at s = sr. we will call these vectors relativistic gamow kets.

this denition will therefore have features that are the same as those of the pole denition. in particular, the

the complex pole position sr by itself does not dene mass and width separately. but the third denition by
the vector g
jsr has additional features in terms of which another separate denition of the quantity  can be given.
these features were not discussed in connection with the z-boson and hadron resonances, because for their values of
/m these features are not observable. these features are the decay probability p(t) and the total decay rate p(t)
and partial decay rates p(t) as functions of time t (in the rest frame), the connection between the initial decay rate
and the width given by p(0) = /, and the exponential decay law for p(t),
p(t) and p(t) of the decaying state

the decay rate and the partial decay rates as functions of time are the main focus of experimental investigations

vector description is essential [24]. only the exponential decay law denes the lifetime r of a decaying state. for
the decaying state g

precisely given by r = 

in the phenomenological treatment [23,24] of decaying state vectors one is not much concerned with questions of the
relativistic denition or the exponential decay law or the line width, it is still very satisfying that there is a precise
vector space description based on the representation (j, sr) of the relativistic space-time symmetry group p and the
s-matrix pole denition, which has all the desired features of a relativistic resonance. this mathematical description
by g
jsr gives the meaning of an elementary particle to the (idealized) resonance or unstable particle, considered
as isolated from a background bg. to what extent such an idealized ket-state can be experimentally prepared is a
dierent question. the accuracy with which the exponential law has been observed in some cases [25] shows that the
isolation of the microphysical state g from a background bg can be very good.

gamow kets g = |z

ri2, zr = er  i/2 were introduced in non-relativistic quantum mechanics two decades

ago [26]. they are like dirac kets |ei, functionals of a rigged hilbert space :

+ : g = |z

+, |ei

the generalized eigenvectors of the self-adjoint (semi-bounded) energy operator h are mathematically dened by

for all   +,
for all   +.

(8a)

the dierence is that e for the dirac-kets is the real scattering energy and zr for the gamow kets is the complex
pole position. the conjugate operator h  of the hamiltonian h is uniquely dened by the rst equality in (8a) as
the extension of the hilbert space adjoint operator h  to the space of functionals 
4; on the space h, the operators
+
h  and h  are the same. we shall write (8a) also in the dirac way as

a galilei transformation can boost this gamow ket to any real (center of mass) momentum p

complex momenta will not be obtained in this way since the galilei transformations commute with the intrinsic
energy operator h.

in the relativistic case the lorentz transformation  in particular lorentz boosts  intermingle energy etot = p0
and momenta pm, m = 1, 2, 3. thus complex energy or complex mass also leads to complex momenta. this has led in
the past to discussions of very complicated complex momentum representations of the poincare group p. to restrict

4for (essentially) self-adjoint h, h  is equal to (the closure of) h; but we shall use the denition (8a) also for unitary
operators u where u  is the extension of u , but not of u.

the unwieldy set of ill-dened poincare group representations, we will consider a special class of minimally complex
irreducible representations of p. our construction will also lead to complex momenta p, but in our case the momenta
will be minimally complex in such a way that the 4-velocities p  p
m remain real. this construction was motivated
by a remark of d. zwanziger [27] and is based on the fact that the 4-velocity eigenvectors |pj3(m, j)i furnish as valid a
basis for the representation space of p as the usual wigner basis of momentum eigenvectors |pj3(m, j)i. this means
every state  of an uir (j, m) 5, can be written according to diracs basis vector decomposition as

 =xj3 z d3 p

as a consequence of (12), the -function normalization of these velocity-basis vectors is

)  = 2p0m23(p  p

)  .

(11)

(12)

(13)

here, |p, j3i   are the eigenkets of the 4-velocity operator p = pm 1 and j3 (p) = hj3 p|i represents the 4-
velocity distribution of the vector . the 4-velocity eigenvectors are often more useful for physical reasoning, because
4-velocities seem to fulll to a rather good approximation velocity super-selection rules which the momenta do
not [28].

the relativistic gamow vectors will therefore be dened, not as momentum eigenvectors, but as 4-velocity eigen-
vectors in the direct product space of uir spaces for the decay products of the resonances r. we want to obtain
the relativistic gamow vectors from the pole term of the relativistic s-matrix in complete analogy to the way the
non-relativistic gamow vectors were obtained [26]. for the resonance r we start with the pole of the analytically
continued partial s-matrix with angular momentum j = jr at the value s = sr  (mr  i/2)2 of the invariant
2
mass square variable (mandelstam variable) s = (p1 + p2 + )2 = e2
r, where p1, p2,. . . are the momenta
of the decay products of r [13]. this means that the mass mr and lifetime /r or the complex invariant mass
wr = (mr  i/2) = sr, in addition to spin sr, are the intrinsic properties that dene the unstable relativistic

particle.

in order to make the analytic continuation of the partial s-matrix with angular momentum j, we need the angular

poincare group with the exact generators (26). we will use these vectors |pj3(wj)i for the denition of the
relativistic gamow vectors.

the relativistic gamow kets are obtained by analytically continuing the dirac-lippmann-schwinger kets (24) or (23)
into the second (or higher) sheet of the jr-th partial wave s-matrix sjr(s) to the position of the resonance pole at
sr = (mr  i/2)2. this can be done for any value of p (and j3), e.g., for p = 0.

the crucial observation is that the parameters of the boost l, that transforms the momentum prest = (w, 0, 0, 0) into

distribution hjr s|jr sri  1
with the above properties one can show, in much the same way as in the rhs theory of non-relativistic gamow
vectors, that the time translation of the decaying state is given by a semigroup, e.g., at rest,

as in (27).

ssr

eih |p = 0, j3(srjr)i = eimr e /2|p = 0, j3(srjr)i for   0 only

(32)

where  is time in the rest system. this is the exponential time evolution from which the lifetime and the exponential
law for the decay rates follow.

in conclusion, the vector of the representation (jr, sr) of p provide an exact  not approximate  description for
all properties expected of isolated relativistic resonances or unstable particles and of one unexpected property, the
asymmetric time evolution given by a semigroup.

[24] in the eective lee-oehme-yang theory, the ml il/2 and ms is /2 are eigenvectors of a two-dimensional complex
hamiltonian matrix, not eigenkets of a self-adjoint mass2-operator pp  in a representation space of the relativistic
symmetry group and problems like line shape cannot be discussed (they are also not observable for these values of 
m ).
the term bg in the state vector + is also non-existent in this weisskopf-wigner approximation, cf. e.g., t. d. lee,
particle physics and introduction to field theory (harwood academic publishers, chur, 1981).

[28] the use of the velocity eigenvectors has been suggested as early as 1965 by j. werle, on a symmetry scheme described
by non-lie algebra, ictp preprint, trieste, 1965, unpublished. it has been incorporated in the spectrum-generating group
approach for the mass and spin spectrum, a. bohm, phys. rev. 175, 1767 (1968). it has also been used to relate the form
factors for dierent decays to universal form factors for an su (3) multiplet in a. bohm, phys. rev. d 13, 2110 (1976), and
a. bohm and j. werle, nucl. phys. b 106,165 (1976). as dynamical stability group of p/m  the same idea has been
suggested by h. van dam and l.c. biedenharn, phys. rev. d 14, 405 (1976). velocity eigenstates were introduced around
1990 as states of heavy quark eective theory, again to reduce the number of independent form factors: a.f. falk,
h. georgi, b. grinstein and m.b. wise, nucl. phys. b 343, 1 (1990), h. georgi, proceedings of the theoretical advanced
study institute, eds. r. k. ellis et al. (world scientic, 1992) and references thereof. in this approach one often gets the
impression that the use of the velocity basis vectors leads to approximate results. this, however, is not the case if one takes
into consideration that velocity eigenkets do not represent physical states, but that physical state vectors are obtained
from the kets as continuous superpositions using the right measure in the integration. if this is done, the values of the
observable quantities do not depend upon whether one uses the velocity basis or the momentum basis, only that the use
of the velocity basis often provides a more practical means of computation, by leading to form factors that do not depend
upon the mass.
