we discuss the entropy for the extremal btz black hole and the extremal

ebtz black hole. the ebtz black hole means the btz black hole em-

bedded in a ve-dimensional(5d) black hole. the six-dimensional(6d) black

string with traveling waves is introduced as a concrete model for realizing

the ads/cft correspondence. the traveling waves carry the momentum

distribution p(u) which plays an important role in counting the entropy and

establishing the correspondence. it turns out that the ebtz black hole is

consistent with the ads/cft correspondence.

i. introduction

recently the ads/cft correspondence has attracted much interest. this is based on

the duality relation between the string theory (bulk theory) on adsd+1 and a conformal eld

theory(cft) as its d-dimensional boundary theory [13]. the s-wave calculation of greybody

factor (dynamic property) for the btz black hole on ads3 is in agreement with that of a 5d

black hole with three charges q1, q5, nk [4]. this is obvious because in the low energy limit

a 5d black hole reduces to the btz black hole [5]. furthermore the greybody factor for the

btz black hole agrees with the cft2 calculation on the boundary of ads3 [6]. this proves

the ads3/cft2 correspondence for the greybody factor. in the calculation of the greybody

factor we need to study the propagation of test elds in the btz black hole background

[7]. for counting the entropy we investigate the static conguration of the black hole itself

[8,9]. a 5d black hole was originally constructed by the bound states of q1 d1-branes and

q5 d5-branes with some momentum p (= 2nk/l = nk/r1) along an internal circle(s1)

with the radius r1. in order to see a closer relation between the microscopic states and the

classical spacetime, it is convenient to rewrite a 5d black hole to include s1 as a space. it

comes out a six-dimensional(6d) black string. even though the extension of the spacetime,

the entropy for a 5d black hole is the same as in a 6d black string. in this work a 6d black

string with traveling waves is introduced as a concrete model for realizing the ads/cft

correspondence. the traveling waves carry the momentum distribution. this plays an

important role in counting the entropy and establishing the ads/cft correspondence.

nowdays it seems to be a discrepancy for counting the entropy (static property) of

the btz black hole in relation to the ads/cft correspondence. first we assume that

the btz black hole is not embedded in string theory.

in this sense this corresponds to

an exact ads3 background. and thus this is described as a solution to the pure three-

dimensional(3d) gravity(s3d = 1

)/8g32 and j = +/4g3 correspond to the mass and angular

momentum of the btz black hole. +() are the outer(inner) horizon. this can be

described by a sl(2,r)lsl(2,r)r chern-simons theory. since it is a topological eld
in this direction
theory, the physical degrees of freedom reside only on the boundary.

an important question arises: what elds provide the relevant degrees of freedom on the

boundary at innity( = )? a single liouville eld at innity may be a candidate.
unfortunately this has a central charge(c = 1 [10,11]). but we need c = 3/2g3 [12,13] for

ads3/cft2 correspondence at  = . that is, in order to recover the bekenstein-hawking
entropy of the extremal btz black hole with  = + = 0

with the level number n  1. here n = 2

0/4g3 is given by an eigenvalue of the angular

is this btz black hole dual to the

cft of the d1-d5 bound states (d-string theory)? because it is not embedded in string

theory, its boundary cft with c = 1 has nothing to do with the d-string. the liouville

theory is simply a boundary description of the pure 3d gravity sector. martinec showed that

the 3d gravity is a pure gauge theory and thus it examines only its macroscopic properties

(thermodynamics) by a set of noether charges [11]. on the other hand, the gauge theory

of branes(dual cft2) is a tool to investigate its microscopic features. hence the 3d gravity

appears as a collective eld theory of the microscopic dual cft2. on the other hand, string

theory provides many more dynamical elds (c = 6q1q5) and one certainly does not expect

the liouville sector to accommodate all of the states of the system [5]. hence it is not

appropriate for discussing the ads/cft correspondence for the entropy within the pure

3

3d gravity. in this paper, we wish to describe how the ads/cft correspondence for the

entropy can be realized explicitly.

ii. the ebtz black hole

now we consider the btz black hole which resides in the near-horizon geometry of a 5d

black hole. hereafter we call this the embedded btz(ebtz) black hole [1,4,14,15]. at low

energies (  0) the physics of an extremal 5d black hole (6d black string) is governed by
the extremal ebtz black hole. in this case we have an embedded ads3. explicitly a 5d

black hole(m5) has the geometry : ads3 in the near-horizon (the throat region) but with

asymptotically at space. this corresponds to the geometry which interpolates between

ads3 and at space. this black hole has the outer horizon at r = r0 and the inner horizon

at r = 0. and thus the extremal limit means r = r0  r = 0. in this limit the coordinate
relation between a 5d black hole and the ebtz black hole is given by 2 = r2 + 2
0,

 = z/r1, t = t q1 q5/r2

1 the extremal ebtz black hole has its horizon at  = 0. if one
starts with m5s1t4 in the ten-dimensional(10d) type iib superstring theory, we have
ads3s3t4 in the throat region (r0  r  r, r2 = q q1 q5) but nd minkowski space

after passing through the remote boundary (r = r). hereafter we choose a convention

with  = 1. in the extremal limit the relations between qi and q1, q5, nk are given by

v q1 = gsq1, q5 = gsq5, and r2

1v qk = g2

s nk. the 3d newtons constant(g3) is replaced

by [5]

g3 =

g2
s

4vr1r2

(4)

where gs is the string coupling constant and v = v /(2)4 with the volume of t4(v ). notice

that g3 contains all information of the type iib string theory, contrary to g3. the geometry

of the extremal ebtz black hole is described by

ebtz black hole leads to

(7)

which is exactly the same form as in the 5d black hole. therefore all information is encoded

in ads3.

suppose the weakly coupled d-brane description in which bps states are described by

right movers with nk momentum in (1+1) dimensions. then the degeneracy of d-brane

system is given by the degeneracy of cft with a central charge c = 3/2 g3 = 6q1q5 at

level nk. plugging this into (3) leads to the bekenstein-hawking entropy (7). however, this

is done actually in the weak-coupling limit of gsq1, gsq5, g2

s nk  1. this is precisely the
opposite regime where the classical supergravity solution is good. on the supergravity side

a 5d black hole appears in the strong coupling limit with gsq1, gsq5, g2

s nk  1. due to
supersymmetry, one can extrapolate results in the d-brane phase to the black hole phase.

iii. 6d black string

a. 6d black string without momentum modes

we start with a 6d black string with q1 = q5, p = 0 as [16]

(9)

here r is the eective radius of an embedded ads3. this amounts to the zero temperature

limit of the d-string model with q1 and q5. although this is a simple model for the

5

calculation of the greybody factor, it is not good for the entropy counting. the ebtz black

hole is a rotating black hole with the angular momentum j. this contains the information

for the momentum modes. the important thing is how we introduce the total momentum

number n(= nk) into (8).

b. 6d black string with p = constant

recently it is shown that the chiral orbifold of ads3/zn describes the extremal ebtz

black hole of (5) [14,17]. here the chiral orbifold of ads3/zn means a lens space of ads3
[18]. also (ads3/zn )  s3 corresponds to the near-horizon geometry of the extremal 6d
black string with momentum modes p = 2

here 2 = 2g2

s /v is related to the 6d newtons constant. this corresponds to a homoge-

neous (translationally invariant) black string. (10) contains the geometry of the ebtz black

hole in (5). the dierence is that n-term is explicitly shown here in terms of r-coordinate.

however, the horizon geometry (grr = 0) is not changed under the coordinate transformation

r  . consequently, its entropy counting goes exactly to the same way as in the ebtz
black hole. this guarantees that the entropy of the ebtz black hole is invariant under this

orbifolding of ads3  ads3/zn . at this stage let us introduce the ads/cft correspon-
dence. this means that the 10d type iib bulk theory deep in the throat is dual to the 2d

cft of d-string(world sheet theory) on its remote boundary. further, this implies that the

semiclassical limit of spacetime physics (a homogeneous black string) is related to the large

(q1, q5, n) limit of the cft(d-string). concerning the entropy, the relevant quantity is

the total momentum number n. furthermore q1 and q5 are xed numbers. considering

n as a variable, one can understand clearly how this correspondence is realized.

6

c. 6d black string with traveling waves p(u)

we wish to describe how the ads/cft correspondence can be realized in this picture.

first we extend a black string to include traveling waves. the extremal 6d black string

solution (8) has full (1+1)-dimensional poincare invariance, including a null translational

symmetry. thanks to this null symmetry, one can add traveling waves with the momentum

distribution p(u) to any solution as

dsp

6d

2 =  1 +

r2

r2 !1 dudv +

p(u)

r2 du2! + 1 +

r2

r2 !(cid:16)dr2 + r2d2
3(cid:17) .

(11)

although p(u) looks like a pure gauge degree of freedom, it contains an important physical

information (momentum distribution). furthermore p(u) carries this information far from

the horizon. the mechanism is as follows.

in the low energy limit the 6d black string

without p(u) becomes ads3s3. that is, (8) leads to (9). hence a naive counting of the
graviton (d(d 3)/2) implies that in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime we have no propagating
graviton. this counting is suitable for the black holes and non-extremal black strings.

however, our model is the extremal black string with the null killing symmetry. in this case

the graviton mode (p(u)) may be physically propagating. actually this graviton becomes

a propagating mode by the transmutation of the degree of freedom with the other eld

(for example, dilaton) in the extremal black string spacetime [19]. this is similar to the

higgs mechanism for gauge elds in the minkowski spacetime. therefore this graviton is

not traveling along the horizon but becomes purely outgoing in the near-horizon. this is

longitudinal wave moving along the string. it is important to note that this wave propagates

indenitely without radiating to innity or falling into the horizon.

further we review briey how these traveling waves can be generated. this is found

from the technique of garnkle-vachaspati [20]. starting from a known static solution, this

produces a new solution representing waves traveling on the old black string background.

however, it requires that the background metric (gm n ) possess a null, orthogonal killing

vector(km = (/v)m ). as an example, if (gm n , hm n p ) is also an exact solution to the

7

6d einstein-maxwell equations, then (gm n + hm n , hm n p ) is also an exact solution to this

system [19]. here hm n = hkm kn with hgvu = p(u)/r2. this method was originally proposed

for the yang-mills-higgs system coupled to gravity and then applied to the low energy limit

of string theory [21]

the bekenstein-hawking entropy for a 5d black hole and the ebtz black hole can also

be reproduced by this picture [9], provided only that the distribution function p(u) does not
vary too rapidly : p3/2  r2
for the 10d spacetime is

0| p|, where the dot means d/du. the geometry of the near-horizon

with yi on the t4. we note that this is neither ads3s3t4 nor (ads3/zn )s3t4. in
order to rewrite this as ads3s3t4, we must introduce a function , periodic in u which
is related to p(u) by 2 +  = p/r4
0. then the near-horizon geometry can be described by

ads3s3t4 and the horizon area is given by a10 = 22r2

(13)

if one xes the total momentum, the horizon area is maximized by the uniform distribution

of p = constant. then one nds a homogeneous (translationally invariant) black string. in

this case we have p/2 = p/l = 2n/l2 and thus (13) reduces to the familiar form of
bh = 2q1q5n =sebtz
s5d

bh . on the other hand, xing the momentum distribution p(u),

one nds the form of (13).

we wish to count bps states. all of string elds should have the same momentum

distribution as in the black string: p3/2  r2
0| p|. quantum mechanically, however, one can-
not x the momentum distribution p(u) of string elds exactly in d-string theory. this

is so because p(u) and p(u) do not commute and thus its fourier modes satisfy the vira-

soro algebra. instead one introduces a mesoscopic length scale m  l. one divides the
spacetime into x = l/m intervals a(a  {1,   , x}). then the total momentum in the

8

interval a is pa = 2ra p(u)du and it is assumed to be constant. if one could view states

on s1 as consisting of a collection of x-independent systems of length m, the number of

states for c = 6q1q5 string elds with total momentum pa = 2na/m on the a-th inter-

val would be esa with sa = 2qcna/6 = 2q1q5pam. here na  q1q5, because of
p/| p|  m  qq1q52/p. the entropy of x-independent systems is additive so the total
entropy with p1,   , px is given by
cft = 2qq1q5

xa=1qna = q2q1q5z l

0 r p

(14)

which leads to (13).

we note again that on the black string side the traveling waves play an important role

in transferring the information of the horizon into the remote boundary at r = r. the

ads/cft correspondence means that the semiclassical limit of spacetime physics (a 6d

black string with p(u)) is related to the large (q1, q5, p(u)/2) limit of the cft(d-string).

we propose here that a necessary condition for realizing the ads/cft correspondence is

the presence of a 6d black string with traveling waves p(u). on the d-brane side, then

we have the following picture. one nds 4q1q5 bosonic elds and an equal number of

fermionic elds on the circle(s1). these degrees of freedom (6q1q5 bosonic elds) are not

changed as the coupling constant moves from the weak to the strong. one increases the

string coupling gs to arrive at the near-horizon region and nally to form an event horizon

at r = 0. but all of string elds should have the same momentum distribution as in the
black string: p3/2  r2

0| p|.

it is reasonable from the previous discussion to consider that the cft of d-string with

a central charge c = 6q1q5 is well-dened on the remote boundary. also we can calculate

the microscopic entropy at strong coupling. considering (3) together with c = 6q1q5 and

a result of s10d

the large p(u)/2 limit (na  q1q5), one recovers scft = 2q1q5r l
ads3s3t4/cft2.

bh =scft, the ads/cft correspondence for the entropy is established on

0 qp/2du. as

9

iv. discussion

we have shown that a realization of the ads/cft correspondence for the entropy is

possible when the btz black hole is embedded in the string theory(explicitly, a 5d black

hole). to recover sbtz

bh = 20/4g3, we need both the central charge c = 3/2g3 and the

level number nk = 2

0/4g3. however, the pure 3d gravity provides us with c = 1 (not

c = 3/2g3). this is too small to obtain the bekenstein-hawking entropy. this is so because

the 3d gravity is a pure gauge theory and examines only its macroscopic properties. thus

the correspondence between an exact ads3 and cft2 is not conrmed until now. on the

other hand, when the btz black hole is embedded in a 5d black hole, one nds c = 3/2 g3

= 6q1q5. this is exactly the sum of 4q1q5-bosonic string elds and 4q1q5-fermionic

string elds on the d-brane side. the total momentum number nk, in the extremal case,

is given by l0 = j = nk and l0 = 0, where l0 and l0 are the generators of virasoro

algebra. however, this algebra is a realization of the asymptotic symmetry group of an exact

ads3 at innity( = ) [12]. in general, the ads/cft correspondence is well-dened on
the remote boundary at  = q2
0 + r2. hence we need the other mechanism which can

transfer the information of the horizon ( = 0 :

inner boundary) to the outer boundary

0 + r2). as far as we know, this exists only when the background geometry which

( = q2

interpolates between ads3 and at space has a null killing symmetry. the extremal 6d

black string solution has such a symmetry and thus one adds traveling waves with p(u) to

this solution. then they transfer physical information (momentum distribution) from the

horizon to the remote boundary. this is evident from the propagation of the graviton p(u)

in the extremal black string background. also this comes from the fact that the non-ads of

(12) with p(u) can be transformed to ads without p(u). this implies that the near-horizon

geometry is completely independent of the wave prole p(u). hence we suggest that a

necessary condition for realizing the ads/cft correspondence is the presence of a 6d black

string with traveling waves p(u). here p(u) seems to be a messenger which communicates

the information of the bulk(black string) to the boundary(cft). it plays an important role

10

in counting the entropy, but not in the calculation of the greybody factor.

as a result, we provide a concrete model which shows a realization of the ads/cft

correspondence for the entropy in the near-horizon. the other realization of ads3/cft2

correspondence was studied by using a 3d black string in ref. [22].
