preface

generalizing the geometry of the gauge covariant variables in yang-mills the-
ory proposed by johnson and haagensen, the 4-d geometry associated with a
monopole is dened for su(2). there are three relevant geometries: ads2 s2,
r2  s2 and h+  s2, depending on the asymptotic behavior of the torsion.
using this geometry, the wilson loop average is computed `a la nambu-goto
action. in case of ads2  s2, it satises the area law.

1. introduction

one of the most intriguing part of yang-mills theory is that the fundamental gauge eld

variable does not transform covariantly under gauge transformations. this causes construction

of the physical hilbert space rather complicated, if not impossible. this in turn makes dicult

to investigate the nonperturbative aspect of the theory in the strong coupling regime where

perturbation theory fails. thus we need to look at the theory from somewhat dierent point

of view.

one of the proposals made by haagensen and johnson is to introduce a covariant variable

from a geometrical point of view[1]. for example, for su(2) ym theory a new variable ua
be dened such that a constraint equation relating ua

i can

i is

i to the gauge eld aa
k(cid:17) = 0.
juc

ijk(cid:16)jua

k + abcab

(1.1)

for this, the weyl gauge aa
dinates only. then ua
paper, this condition was generalized to allow a small nonvanishing rhs[2]. when ua

0 = 0 is chosen so that the subscript i runs over the spatial coor-
i transforms covariantly under gauge transformations. in a subsequent
i are iden-
tied as dreibeins of some geometry, this constraint equation is equivalent to nothing but the

torsion-free condition. hence, the following combination can be identied as a metric for some

geometry associated with ym theory:

gij  ua

i ua
j .

(1.2)

the local lorentz symmetry is now su(2). the hope is rewriting the theory in terms of ua
i
rather than aa
i so that the outcome can be manifestly gauge invariant. although explicit
metrics are constructed for instanton or monopole backgrounds[2], the role of such a geometry

has not been quite clear so far.

in this paper, we will generalize the above construction including the time component of

the metric for the bps monopole. the bps monopole satises ym equation everywhere, yet

reduces to t hooft-polyakov monopole asymptotically so that it can clarify the behavior of the

metric better. the bps monopole is derived usually in the nonabelian higgs model context,

but such a monopole also exists for ym theory without necessarily introducing an extra scalar

eld. the construction is well known as the (anti)self-dual ym equation can be reduced to

the bogomolnyi equation[3]. it is shown in this paper that the resulting 4-d geometries are
asymptotically ads2s2, r2s2, or h+ s2, all with a nonvanishing torsion. in the ads2s2

1

case the torsion does not vanish even in the r   limit, which distinguishes itself from the

other two cases. we propose that these are relevant to the wilson loop average, as a nambu-
goto action of some geometry is suspected to be relevant for the wilson loop average[4]1. then

we will show how it can be related to the connement in terms of the area law of a wilson
loop. in fact, we shall nd that the relevant geometry for the area law is ads2  s2. other
geometries are related to other phases of ym theory.

2. virtual monopole geometry

for our purpose of getting 4-d geometry, we will not x the weyl gauge. then, let us rst

dene an antisymmetric tensor eld ba

 such that

b = du + u + u,

(2.1)

where b = 1

2 ba

. note that
b transforms covariantly under gauge transformations as u does. unlike the 3-d case, here we

 t at bdx and  ab

 t adxdx, u = ua

t adx,  =  ab

 = abcac

cannot identify u as a vierbein and  as a connection because a, b indices run over only 3-d

while  runs over 4-d. nevertheless, we can still construct

g  ua

ua
,

(2.2)

which takes the role of 4-d metric. note that in this construction g is not dimensionless
because ua
 is not. however, at this stage, since there is no explicit dimensionful parameter, we

will not rescale to a dimensionless one.

the corresponding vierbeins, e a

 , a = (0, a), such that

g = e a

 e b

 ab,

ab = diag( + ++),

can be constructed as

e 0

0  q|ua

i = 0 = e a
e 0

(2.3)

(2.4)

is an su(2) singlet, now the local lorentz symmetry is enlarged to u(1)su(2).

since e 0
0
also the spin connection can be generalized to  ab

by dening



1an analogous conjecture is also used to compute the wilson loop average in the context of the ads/cft

correspondence in string theory[5].

 0b

(2.5)

then the torsion tensor in this case is given as usual in terms of e a

 and  ab



. in this paper,

we are mainly interested in the static case so that

(2.6)

0i = iq|ua

t 0
0i = ie 0

0 already indicates the torsion does not vanish unless e 0

0 is constant.

b can be related to the ym eld strength as

db + b  b = f u  uf.

(2.7)

we can construct this geometry for the monopole background as follows. the relevant bps

monopole solution of self-dual ym equation is

aa

0 =

aa

i = a
ij

tanh mr

xa

r2   mr
r2  1 

xj

 1!
sinh mr! ,

mr

(2.8)

(2.9)

where m is a monopole mass scale. note that aa
0 takes the role of the scalar eld for the usual
monopole solution in the georgi-glashow model (i.e. so(3)  su(2) nonabelian higgs model).

we choose a metric whose spatial component is conformally at:

gij = 2

me2ij,

(2.10)

where  is some length scale. the actual magnitude of  is quite irrelevant since it can always be
rescaled and absorbed into . thus, we could even choose  = 1

m . now we have introduced
in gij an explicit dimensionful parameter coming from the monopole mass scale. thus the
usual dimensionless metric tensor can be obtained easily by rescaling. anyhow, we need such

dimensionful parameters to keep track the dimensionalities of variables. then

demanding the spatial part of the torsion vanishes, we obtain

i = me/ma
ua
i .

aa

i = 

1
m

one can easily solve this for the t hooft-polyakov monopole as r   such that

(2.12)

(2.13)

then

 = m ln (mr).

(2.14)

to compute the time component of the metric, it turns out that we cannot just demand

the torsion-free condition for all components of the torsion. to understand the property of the

torsion better, we can utilize the full bps monopole to nd out the nite r behavior. in fact, in

general the torsion does not have to vanish for nite r. here we shall rst check out the behavior

of b, which in turn will let us know about the torsion. it is reasonable to demand the spatial

component of b vanishes asymptotically so that the energy associated with b to be nite, but

there is no reason to demand the same behavior for the time component of b. in particular,
ba

0i never vanishes for nite r. however, since we do not have any other information for b at
this moment, we will take a compromised position. in the following we shall demand that the

spatial part of the torsion vanishes everywhere, but leave the time component arbitrary. in this

way, we can still obtain the spatial part of the metric from eq.(2.12).

eq.(2.12) can be solved for the bps monopole, eq.(2.9), to obtain

e2 =

1
2

mr2 tanh2 mr

.

the time component of the metric can be derived from ba

0i as follows. let

if we demand ba

0i <  as r  , in general

f (r) = c(mr)n,

(n  0),

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

where c is a constant. n is chosen to be an integer so that the asymptotic behavior can be
consistent with the last term of ba

0i. this choice will also let us avoid later unnecessary branch
cuts when projected onto a two-dimensional surface of wilson loop propagation. we also further
demand that ua

0 <  as m  0. this is because eqs.(2.8)(2.9) are well behaved in this limit.

as a result, the only allowed n are n = 0, 1, 2.

(2.19)

(2.20)

for n = 2, although the asymptotic behavior of b is the same as n = 1 case, the time component

of the resulting metric vanishes as r  . note that the m term behaves the same way as
aa

i asymptotically except the prefactor.

the full metric now reads asymptotically

(n = 0, 1, 2).

(2.21)

for n = 0, it is ads2  s2. for n = 1, r2  s2. for n = 2 the rst two terms are the poincare
metric for the upper half plane so that the asymptotic topology can be identied as h+  s2.

the torsion can be computed accordingly:

(2.22)

(2.23)

and all other components vanish. note that in other than n = 0 case, the torsion vanishes in
the limit r  . however, for n = 0, t 0

0i survives even in this limit.

this denes a geometry associated with a monopole in su(2) ym theory. c2 = 1 is

a constant that determines the signature of the geometry, which can be either euclidean or
lorentzian depending on the value of ua

0. since this geometry is not that of the spacetime,
but associated with the dynamical property of the monopole, we call it virtual monopole

geometry. the exact form of the metric for nite r cannot be determined at this moment

because there is no other information about b.

we can now compute the wilson loop average in this background.

3. wilson loop average

it has long been suspected that the wilson loop average would take the following form in

the leading order[4]:

w (c)  esng(c ),

(3.1)

5

where c is a minimal area surface bounded by c. higher order terms are expected to be
related to the extrinsic geometry of c[4, 6]. intuitively, this is a fairly plausible assumption
in the following sense. the exponent of the wilson loop operator can be rewritten as an

integration over a at surface bounded by the contour using the stokes theorem. however, the

surface integration is restricted by the derivative of the gauge eld. this surface integration is

equivalent to a geometric form of surface integration over a curved surface in which the classical

part of the gauge eld provides the necessary geometrical information. the leading term of

this integration is nothing but the nambu-goto action because the latter simply computes the

surface area. any explicit indisputable proof of this argument does not exist yet for ym theory,

but it will most likely turn out to be true.

in fact, a rough estimation along the line of the argument in the above paragraph shows

this is quite reasonable in our case. using the stokes theorem, we obtain

ic

dxaa

 = zdc

dba

 ,

where  is a surface element of at surface dc bounded by c, and

introducing a surface parameter, we can rewrite

  aa
ba

  aa

d2 ij i xj xba

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

where c is now a curved parameter surface. we can now expand b around the monopole
background according to aa

 such that

if we perform the same computation for m  0 limit, we obtain the

n = 2 case of the metric. n = 0 case is slightly more complicated because b(0)a
0i = 0 for the
t hooft-polyakov monopole limit in the weyl gauge. however, a careful analysis based on
eq.(2.8) in the limit m  0 rst and then r   leads to b(0)a
r2 . this leads to g00 = r2
and gii = r2. properly rescaling by t  2

mt, we can obtain the n = 0 case of eq.(2.21).

this certainly indicates the wilson loop average is likely of the form

w (c) = erc

+h.o.z daeis[a]tr erdc

d b

(3.10)

for a proper action of a derived from the ym action.

thus, assuming there is no further complication due to the a part, here we propose the

relevant nambu-goto action is the one dened by the string of a magnetic ux embedded in

the virtual monopole geometry we constructed:

sng(c) =

1

2 zc

d2q|detij|,

(3.11)

where g is given by eq.(2.21). the rational choice of the string tension is the one associated
with the monopole mass scale such that

m can be chosen.

2 = 2

fixing the worldsheet coordinates as 0 = t and 1 = x1, we can compute the nambu-goto

action over a rectangle in the (t, x1)-plane with sides t and r to obtain

sng  2n

m t v (r).

(3.12)

v (r) is equivalent to the potential energy between quarks due to the nature of the wilson loop

average. note that dierent n values lead to dierent behaviors of the wilson loop average,

which suggests that this index is a parameter classifying dierent phases of ym theory. for

given n = 0, 1, 2, the potential energy between quarks behaves for large r like

n = 0,
r,
ln(mr), n = 1,
 1
n = 2.
r ,

(3.13)

v (r)  


the n = 0 case has the linear potential, hence, it satises the area law. the corresponding
metric has asymptotic ads2  s2 topology. recall that n = 0 is the only case that the torsion

7

does not vanish in the r   limit, indicating that the connement case has a distinctive

geometry compared to other two cases.

the n = 2 case is the coulomb phase.

the third possibility of n = 1 is intriguing, but we suspect that this might be the case

of the oblique connement[7]. this is not actually a far fetched identication. the monopole

solution we have is in fact dyonic for nite r. this is because the nonvanishing leading order
of nonabelian electric eld ea
r4 , although the contribution of the t hooft-
i
polyakov monopole limit is zero. based on the argument that condensations of these objects

for large r is  xixa

cause connements, it is clear there are two dierent possibilities in our case depending on

the characteristics in which condensations occur. since the dyonic behavior is due to a higher

order contribution, we could identify n = 1 case as the oblique connement. note that the

logarithmic potential is also conning in the sense the potential increases asymptotically, even

though it does meet the area law criterion.

4. final remarks

it is shown in this paper that the geometrical structure suggested by haagensen and johnson

can be generalized to 4-d and it can take an important role to prove connement in ym theory,

provided that the wilson loop average can be computed in terms of nambu-goto action. the

result leads to three possible phases of ym theory, presumably, conning, oblique conning and

coulomb phases, although the approach in this paper does not address any dynamical issues

of them.

the behavior of dierent phases are closely related to the property of b eld, which is

related to the torsion of the 4-d geometry we obtained. our result applies only for large r, but

it is possible to know more about the nite r region if further information on b is available.

one possible way of incorporating b is to introduce it as the nonabelian version of the kalb-

ramond eld. then it should be possible that ym theory can be described by a as well as

by (u, b). in this sense, one can speculate that b could take the role of the dual eld in the

nonabelian case[4].

it will be interesting to see if b is relevant in the string formulation of

gauge theory.

the result of this paper also suggests that there might be a string theory on ads2  s2 with
a torsion which could be relevant to ym theory or qcd in 4-d in the spirit of [8]. the case of
string theory on ads2  s2 without torsion was investigated in [9].

8

the most important remaining question in this paper is of course if one can show explicitly

that the wilson loop average in ym theory is related to the nambu-goto action of some string

theory. in our approach, it is necessary to show that a quantum contribution does not spoil

the structure. this will most likely lead to a dual geometrical formulation of ym theory,

presumably a string theory in an extrinsic geometry, in which a is properly translated into
g. we believe that the geometry provided here is some clue to that.
