(7) (8) l act algebraically formal polynomials a, f , v dv. consistent chain terms may recovered action alone. indeed, k 2n1k(v, a, f ) = 1 k! mk2n1(a, f ). (9) hand, l needed computation covariant chain terms. proved  covariant chain terms indeed covariant provided computed k 2n1k(v, dv, a, f ) = 1 k! 2 (m l)k2n1(a, f ). (10) shift formula incorporate covariant chain terms, following (incorrect) expression given  2n1(a + v, f + dv). (11) expression reproduce (10) l commute. precisely, problem algebraic restrictions l derivations (a, f ) (these restrictions commute v dv) commute other, restrictions relevant dierence l. even l changed w.r.t. action (v, dv) commute derivations (a, f, v, dv), may achieved choosing mdv = ldv = 2v2 instead v2 like (7), (8), shift formula (11) would wrong formula (12) would correct. correct shift formula takes non-commutativity account repro- duces (10), exp(v + dv f )2n1(a, f ) (12) may checked easily (see also , journal version). exponential de- ned power series, derivative understood algebraic sense, e.g., v(/a)p (a) = p (a + v)|v1 (i.e., component p (a + v) linear v). formula equal expression (6) proposed {$9903147$}, may proved easily. indeed, +dv ev f 2n1(a, f ) = f ev e(dv+v2) 2n1(a, f ) = 2n1(a + v, f + dv + v2) = used bakercampbellhausdor formula rst step. 2n1(a + v, d(a + v) + (a + v)2) (13) 3 summary shown shift formula (6) proposed {$9903147$} generation covariant chain terms cohomological analysis  lead identical results chain terms. discrepancy mentioned {$9903147$} simply due incorrect expression shift formula , supported (correct) cohomological computation paper. nding points towards correctness shift formula proposed {$9903147$} covariant chain terms. mentioned point, however, physical interpretation higher covariant chain terms yet found. 3 achnowledgement author thanks school mathematics trinity college, dublin, work performed, hospitality. thanks due c. ekstrand helpful comments. author supported forbairt basic research grant.
