(2) (3) (4) (5) take = 1 take non-relativistic massive limit, corresponds f 1 (this means must scale r p appropriate powers mass, giving p 1 weight 1 rewrite part envisioned virasoro algebra 2 giving r weight 1 2 ). see extend algebra. case,  = (n + 1)ln1 = p  = (n 1)ln+1 = r ln r ln p (6) (7) evaluate algebra classically (ie. using poisson brackets) . using two relations, nd ln = r2 n 2 2ln1 rp + (n + 1)r p ln1. (8) given l0 = 1 2 rp, use recursive relation see must ln = 2 r1+np1n. now, must check ls satisfy virasoro algebra.  = = 1 4 1 4  (r1+n+mp1(n+m)) = (m n)ln+m (9) (10) thus conrm fact generators full virasoro algebra. one also note ls found seem obey usual relationship l n = ln. iii. general case: scale-invariant hamiltonians consider general scale invariant hamiltonian write, given p dimension 1 2 r dimension 1 2 h = p2 2f (u) (11) f arbitrary function u = rp. motivated previous calculation results {$9804177$}, make following ansatz, ln = 2 r1+np1nf n. (12) use convention  = 1 2 note reduces case {$9804177$} free particle case described appropriate limits. again, must check full virasoro algebra satised.  = 1 4  = (m n)lm+n 1 4  = (m n)lm+n (13) shows given scale invariant hamiltonian one variable, one construct (classically) generators 0+1 dimensional conformal symmetry, also generators full virasoro algebra. iv. relativistic limit consider massless relativistic limit. case, scale r p powers mass. thus, r weight 1 p weight 1. may rewrite case terms previous analysis making following change variables r = r2 p = l r = p r r = p 2r (14) see, expected, r weight -1 p weight 1 note rp = r p choose 2 . f (rp) = rp f(r p) nd ln = 2 r1+np1nf n = 2 r1+2np f n = r1+n p f n. (15) (16) let us set f = 1. see l1 = p related relativistic hamiltonian h = p expected manner . charge-free subgroup provides representation 0+1 conformal group well {$9711200$}. one reason consider relativisitic limit easily linked representation virasoro algebra terms dieomorphisms circle. point view, one may write generators algebra ln = en . (17) may instead consider hamiltonian h = |p|. may achieved setting f = 1 positive p f = 1 negative p. note technical issues associated singular behavior p = 0. 3 consider transformation r = e ln = en = r1+n r = r1+n p. (18) note, however, condition r real amounts constraint either = c = + c c purely imaginary. sense, think virasoro algebra (in relativistic free particle limit, least) arising dieomorphisms circle, analytically continued real line. v. computing central charge analysis previous section also provides insight quantization virasoro algebra. transition r p essentially quantization system. transformation previous section seems give us ordering quantum generators. particular, make ansatz quantum operator. examine full quantum algebra, nd ln = r1+n p  =  = r1+n p = r1+np r1+mp = (n m)r1+n+m p = (n m)ln+m. (19) (20) case free relativistic particle, exhibited generators satisfy full quantum virasoro algebra central charge. vi. multiplets states one might expect able nd states organized highest weight represen- tations virasoro algebra. fact, somewhat dicult. 1+1 conformal eld theory, l0 hamiltonian bounded below. since ls shift eigenvalue l0, one nds eigenstate l0 corresponding minimum eigenvalue must annihilated half ls lowering operators. upon eigenstate one builds multiplets algebra. case, however, l0 generator dilatations, eigenvalues bounded. instead, hamiltonian given (up constant factors) l1. order nd equivalent construction, must nd linear combinations ls  = c xn anln. (21) operators raising lowering operators representation. using commutation relations, one easily see raising lowering operators form 4 ekrp. (22) one could see well remembering since h = p, raising lowering operators operators shift momentum. state annihilated operators zero momentum state. since annihilated operators, one cannot build multiplet upon it. sense, highest weight representation. vii. hermiticity global time noted that, constructions provided previous sections, one condition l n = ln. seems unusual given that, cases, scale- invariant mechanics actually describes motion particle background ads2. lns bulk fourier modes bulk stress-energy tensor, must obey hermiticity condition. one might ask appear true particle. answer related choice time. free non-relativistic particle free relativistic particle limits hamil- tonian found {$9804177$}. hamiltonian derived born-infeld action radial excitations particle background ads2 s2 given poincare coordinates. coordinates cover entire anti-de sitter space. one write coordinates way space cover half-plane conformally at. ds2 = 1 u2 (dt2 + du2) u > 0 (23) one thinks coordinates parametizing upper half complex plane, time translation translation along real axis. since lns generate transformations upper half-plane, one see l1 generator translation along real axis. therefore, reasonable associate hamiltonian l1. one easily sees one identify l1,0,1 h,d k way virasoro algebra 0+1 conformal algebra close. usual situation familiar 1+1 conformal eld case, generally nd hamiltonian given l0, theory. l order nd similar relations, one must choose time coordinate time translation generated l0. global time coordinates well suited purpose. coordinates may written n = ln. ds2 = (1 + a2r2)dt2 + (1 + a2r2)1dr2. transformation wick rotation, one nds metric tan() = ar = eat (24) (25) actually parameterize cads2, covering space ads2. 5 ds2 = 1 a22cos2() (d2 + 2d2) 2 < < 2 . (26) clear time translation corresponds scaling half-plane, gen- erated l0. let us write action particle anti-de sitter space background given global time coordinates. l = mq(1 + a2r2) (1 + a2r2)1 r2 hamiltonian associated action h = (1 + a2r2) 1 2 (m2 + p2 + a2r2p2) 1 2 . (27) (28) large radius, relativisitic limit hamiltonian reduces h = p (as one would expect relativisitic particle nearly space). following logic used above, set l0 = h = p. must attempt nd generators rest virasoro algebra. note expect l1,0,1 expressed terms h, k (which formulation appropriate poincare coordinates). l0 = h, way write l1 l1 terms h, k close virasoro algebra. one quickly sees order  = mlm hold (classically), lm must form make ansatz lm = gm(p)emr. lm = emrp (29) (30) readily verify choice satises classical virasoro algebra poisson brackets. also note l n = ln (classically). exactly hoped nd order match intuition 1+1 cft. next question whether system quantized. consider ansatz lm quantum operator. clear l = lm. one also sees lm = e 2 rpe 2 r  = e n + e n 2 rpe 2 r + e n 2 r + e 2 2 re n 2 e n 2 r]e n 2 rpe 2 r n 2 2 r + e = (n m)ln+m + 2 re n 2 2 n 2 re n 2 r = (n m)ln+m. (31) (32) therefore conclude free relativistic particle global time, virasoro algebra satises hermiticity central charge. one may also consider limit small ads radius small m. case, nd 6 take ansatz l0 = h = pr2. lm = pr2e r . (33) (34) again, verify virasoro algebra indeed close poisson brackets. quantize system, make ansatz lm = e 2r rpre 2r (35) quantum operator. nd quantum virasoro algebra closes central charge. viii. conclusion interesting note ads/cf correspondence served motivational tool derivation. conformal mechanics described need related theory anti-de sitter space. worthwhile investigate relationship conformal mechanics gravity theories ads2 {$9711200$} {$9711200$}. additionally, arguments given apply mechanics single variable. would interesting conjecture conformal mechanics arbitrary number degrees freedom contains symmetries virasoro algebra. true, would closely cement relationship found {$9809027$} conformal quantum mechanics 1+1 conformal eld theory. finally, would interesting completely understand quantization conformal mechanics models. concretely, one would like know way determine central charge normal-ordering conventions arbitary scale-invariant hamiltonians. thus far, systems able quantize could thought describing limit particle background ads2. since bulk theory two-dimensional quantum gravity theory, central charge bulk virasoro algebra vanish (when ghosts included). one might speculate reason central charge quantum mechanics vanished cases found. one would like know non-vanishing central charge could perhaps found quantized systems represent particle background ads2. acknowledgments gratefully acknowledge s. cullen, j. gomis, e. halyo, r. kallosh, s. shenker, e. silverstein, y. song, n. toumbas a. van proeyen useful discussions. especially thank a. strominger l. susskind helpful comments. work supported department defense, ndseg fellowship program nsf grant phy-9870115. 7
