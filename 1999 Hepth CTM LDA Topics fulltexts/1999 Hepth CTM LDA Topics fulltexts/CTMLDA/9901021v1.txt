conformal anomaly of submanifold observables in

ads/cft correspondence

c. robin graham and edward witten

abstract. we analyze the conformal invariance of submanifold observables associated with
k-branes in the ads/cft correspondence. for odd k, the resulting observables are conformally
invariant, and for even k, they transform with a conformal anomaly that is given by a local
expression which we analyze in detail for k = 2.

1. introduction

there has been much recent interest in the correspondence [1] between conformal eld theory
and string theory on negatively curved or anti de sitter spacetimes. in this correspondence,
correlation functions of local conformal elds on an n-manifold m are computed in terms of the
asymptotic behavior of elds on n+ 1-dimensional einstein manifolds x of conformal boundary
m [2],[3]. (here we are actually suppressing the role of some compactied dimensions that will
be unimportant for the present paper. the string theory is actually formulated on x  w for
a suitable compact manifold w ; the dimension of x  w is 10 or 11 depending on whether we
are doing string theory or m-theory. we will generally suppress mention of w .)
the relevant notion of conformal boundary is that of conformal innity in the sense introduced
by penrose (see [4]). x is the interior of an n+ 1-dimensional manifold-with-boundary x whose
boundary is m. the metric g+ on x is complete and has a double pole on the boundary in the
following sense. if r is a smooth function on x with a rst order zero on the boundary of x,
and positive on x, then r is called a dening function. the requirement on g+ is that for any
dening function r, g = r2g+ extends as a smooth metric on x. clearly, if so, the restriction of
g to m gives a metric on m. this metric changes by a conformal transformation if the dening
function is changed, so m has a well-dened conformal structure but not a well-dened metric.
if x is an einstein manifold, then with a suitable choice of coordinates the metric of x looks
like

with gr an r-dependent family of metrics on m; the metric on m is just g0.

the converse problem  given a conformal structure on m, nd an einstein metric on x
which induces it at innity  also has a solution under certain conditions. for example, if
m = sn, endowed with a conformal structure suciently close to the standard one, and x
is an n + 1-ball, then [5] there is a unique einstein metric on x with a prescribed negative
curvature that is close to the standard hyperbolic metric on the ball and has m as conformal
innity.

in relating conformal eld theory on m to quantum gravity on x, ultraviolet divergences
on m are typically related to infrared divergences on x. this is briey described in [3]; the

this research was partially supported by nsf grant phy-9513835.

relation of the statement to ideas about holography is explained somewhat more fully in [6]. for
example, to compute the partition function of the conformal eld theory on m, as a function
of the metric of m, one must, in the supergravity approximation, evaluate the gravitational
action for an einstein metric on x that induces at innity the given conformal structure on
m. for an einstein metric, the gravitational action is proportional to the volume. thus, to
compute the partition function of the conformal eld theory, one formally must evaluate the
volume

(1.2)

vol(x) = zx

dvx,

where dvx = pdet g+dn+1x is the riemannian volume form of x. this integral clearly diverges
in view of the form (1.1) of the metric on x. one regularizes it by letting x be the subset of
x with r  , and
(1.3)

dvx.

vol(x) = zx

vol(x) has terms that diverge as negative powers of , and also a logarithmic term if n is even.
after subtracting the divergent terms, one gets a renormalized functional volr(x), which, for
a suitable choice of x, determines the supergravity limit of the conformal eld theory partition
function on m. as shown in detail in [7], the logarithmic term in vol(x) leads to a conformal
anomaly in volr(x) that reproduces the expected conformal anomaly of the conformal eld
theory on m.

the conformal anomaly is possible because the regularization violates conformal invariance.
indeed, the choice of a particular dening function r is built into the denition of x. but the
choice of r violates conformal invariance, because it xes a particular metric (namely r2g+) in
the conformal class of metrics on m. the anomaly means that, for even n, conformal invariance
is not restored after renormalization.

submanifolds

our goal in the present paper is to analyze a somewhat similar problem concerning subman-
ifolds of x. consider, for example, type iib superstring theory on x  s5, where x is an
einstein manifold (of negative scalar curvature) with conformal boundary a four-manifold m.
it has been argued [8],[9] that to compute the expectation value of a wilson line on a circle
n  m, one must consider a path integral with a string whose worldsheet y  x has n
as boundary.
in the supergravity approximation, y should obey the equation of a minimal
area surface. formally speaking, if a(y ) is the area of y and t the string tension, then the
expectation value of the wilson line on n is

hw (n)i = exp(t a(y ))

(1.4)
in the supergravity approximation. here w (n) is the wilson line operator and hw (n)i is its
expectation value.
similarly, one can consider examples in which the string theory contains a k-brane for some
k. then one associates an observable w (n) to a k-dimensional submanifold n of m.
its
expectation value is computed by a path integral with a brane wrapped on a k + 1-dimensional

y is actually a submanifold of x  w . for simplicity, we will consider only the case that y projects to a

point in w and so can be regarded as a submanifold of x.

2

submanifold y  x whose boundary is n. in the supergravity approximation, the expectation
value of the surface observable w (n) is again given formally by (1.4), with a(y ) now the
volume of y .

the trouble with this formula is that, given the form of the metric (1.1), a(y ) is always
innite. hence, one proceeds just as one does in renormalizing the volume vol(x). one lets y
be the part of y with r  , and one denotes the volume of y as a(y ). as   0, a(y ) has
divergent terms that are negative powers of , plus a logarithmic term if k is even. as explained
in [3], the divergent terms correspond to ultraviolet divergences in conformal eld theory. after
subtracting the divergent terms, one gets a renormalized volume functional ar(y ) which should
be used instead of a(y ) in (1.4). however, when k is even, a(y ) is not conformally invariant.
the violation of conformal invariance is given by a local expression that we will analyze. the
anomaly is possible, of course, because the denition of y depends on the choice of the dening
function r and so violates conformal invariance.

note that the problem of dening the volume of a submanifold is in a very precise sense a
generalization of the problem of dening vol(x). indeed, in the special case k = n, n = m,
y = x, ar(y ) coincides with volr(x).

questions of existence and regularity of minimal area submanifolds (usually of hyperbolic
space) with prescribed boundary at innity have been studied in the mathematical literature;
see [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. (an error in [13] is corrected in [15].)

examples

we conclude this introduction with comments on a few of the basic examples to which the

discussion can be applied.

first we consider examples with zerobranes, that is with k = 0. for example, in type iib
on x  s3  t4, with x a hyperbolic three-manifold, zerobranes on x arise from onebranes
wrapped on a one-cycle in t4. let  be the mass of the zerobrane (in units in which the
einstein equations on x read rij = 3gij). in the regime in which supergravity formulas such
as (1.4) are valid, one has  >> 1. the conformal boundary of x is a riemann surface m.
since k = 0, the brane world-volume is a curve y  x; its boundary consists of a pair of
points p, q  m. the operator associated with the endpoint of the brane worldvolume is thus a
local operator (p ). actually, assuming that the zerobrane worldvolume is oriented (as in the
example noted in the last paragraph), the points p, q are endowed with opposite orientations
and conjugate operators (p ), (q). to compute the two point function h(p )(q)i in the
supergravity approximation, one takes y to be a minimum length geodesic connecting p and
q. one then has asymptotically

(1.5)

with l(y ) the length of y .

h(p )(q)i = exp(l(y )),

here, because k = 0 is even, we encounter a conformal anomaly. in fact, it is clear without
any analysis at all that there must be an anomaly. if the correlation function (1.5) did not
require some renormalization leading to an anomaly, then this correlation function would be
conformally invariant. hence the operators ,  would have conformal dimension zero, a
behavior which is impossible (for non-constant local operators) in a unitary conformal eld
theory.

the actual computation of the anomaly is straightforward for k = 0. the length is regularized
by replacing l(y ) by l(y ), the length of the part of y with r  . as   0, l(y ) receives a

3

divergent contribution from each of the two ends of y . with the metric in (1.1), the divergent
contribution of either end is precisely +1  ln 1/. hence the two point function in (1.5), after
regularization, has the form

(1.6)
where s() has a limit as   0. one denes the renormalized two point function h(p )(q)ir
to be the limit s(0). since  has dimensions of length or (mass)1, s has dimensions of
(mass)2, and hence  and  have conformal dimension . by contrast, in the general ads/cft
correspondence, an ads particle of mass  should (in n dimensions) correspond to a conformal

h(p )(q)i = 2s(),

eld of dimension d() = (n + pn2 + 42)/2. this reduces to d() =  in the large  limit,

where (1.5) is valid, so the anomaly reproduces the expected conformal dimension of  and 
in this limit.

the next case is k = 1. the most familiar example is that of t hooft and wilson loops
in four-dimensional gauge theory. there is no anomaly for odd k, so these operators have no
conformal anomaly.

the next case  and the last one that we will consider specially  is k = 2. examples are
known for various values of n up to n = 6. for instance, k = 2, n = 6 arises in the case of
m-theory on ads7  s4. by replacing s4 with a quotient, one can also build other k = 2,
n = 6 examples with less supersymmetry. for k = 2 and n = 6, the operators w (n) are
surface observables in a six-dimensional conformal eld theory. as k = 2 is even, an anomaly
occurs; it will be analyzed in detail in the next section. because of our limited understanding
of the six-dimensional conformal eld theories, no independent way to compute this anomaly
is presently known, so there is no theory for us to compare to.

the computation of the anomaly for k = 2 thus gives new information about the conformal
eld theories that arise from these constructions. in section 2 of this paper, we will dene the
anomaly precisely, and describe some of its general properties, for all k. then we will do a
detailed computation for k = 2.

the anomaly for k = 2 has also been briey discussed, in the case that m is conformally

at, in [16], which appeared while the present paper was in gestation.

2. the computation

let x n+1 be the interior of a compact manifold with boundary x, let m = x, and let g+ be
a conformally compact metric on x. this means that if r is a dening function for m  x (in
a sense explained in the introduction), then g = r2g+ extends smoothly to x. the conformal
class of the restriction of g to t m is independent of the choice of dening function. the function
|dr|2
g extends smoothly to x, and its restriction to m is independent of the choice of r, so is
an invariant of g+. we will assume that g+ satises the einstein condition ric(g+) = ng+. it
follows upon conformally transforming the einstein equation that in this case one has |dr|2
g = 1
on m.

conformally compact metrics with |dr|2

g = 1 on m may be put in a special form near the
boundary using a special class of dening functions. the following lemma is taken from [5]
(see lemma 5.2).
lemma 2.1. a metric on m in the conformal innity of g+ determines a unique dening
function r in a neighborhood of m in x such that g|t m is the prescribed boundary metric and
such that |dr|2

g = 1.

4

proof. given any choice of dening function r0, let g0 = r2
and dr = e(dr0 + r0d). thus

0g+ and set r = r0e, so g = e2g0

0|d|2
(2.1)
(where ( , ) is the inner product in the metric g0), so the condition |dr|2

= |dr0|2 + 2r0(dr0, d) + r2

g0

|dr|2

g = |dr0 + r0d|2

g0

g = 1 is equivalent to

(2.2)

2(dr0, d) + r0|d|2

g0

1  |dr0|2

.

this is a non-characteristic rst order pde for , so there is a solution near m with |m
arbitrarily prescribed.

this lemma means that not only does a dening function r determine a metric on m in its
conformal class, but conversely given such a metric on m, there is a natural way to determine
a distinguished dening function r, at least in a neighborhood of m. since we will only be
interested in the behavior of r near m, it follows that for our purposes, the choice of a metric
on m in its conformal class is equivalent to the choice of a dening function.

a dening function determines for some  > 0 an identication of m  [0, ) with a neighbor-
hood of m in x: (p, )  m  [0, ) corresponds to the point obtained by following the integral
curve of gr emanating from p for  units of time. for a dening function of the type given
in the lemma, with |dr|2
g = 1, the -coordinate is just r, and gr is orthogonal to the slices
m  {}. hence, identifying  with r, on m  [0, ) the metric g takes the form g = gr + dr2
for a 1-parameter family gr of metrics on m, and

(2.3)

g+ = r2(gr + dr2).

one can explicitly calculate the ricci curvature of a metric of the form (2.3) so as to express
the einstein condition directly in terms of gr. from an analysis of the formal asymptotics of
solutions of the resulting equations (see [17] or [7]), one deduces that for n odd, the expansion
of gr is of the form

(2.4)

gr = g(0) + g(2)r2 + (even powers) + g(n1)rn1 + g(n)rn + . . . ,

where the g(j) are tensors on m, and g(n) is trace-free with respect to a metric in the conformal
class on m. for j even and 0  j  n  1, the tensor g(j) is locally formally determined by the
conformal representative, but g(n) is formally undetermined, subject to the trace-free condition.
for n even the analogous expansion is

gr = g(0) + g(2)r2 + (even powers) + krn log r + g(n)rn + . . . ,

(2.5)
where now the g(j) are locally determined for j even and 0  j  n 2, k is locally determined
and trace-free, the trace of g(n) is locally determined, but the trace-free part of g(n) is formally
undetermined. moreover, so long as n  3, one has
g(2)
(2.6)
ij = pij,
where (n  2)pij = rij  r
of the chosen representative gij of the conformal innity.

2(n1) gij, and rij and r denote the ricci tensor and scalar curvature

later we will need to use the following lemma.

lemma 2.2. let r and r be special dening functions as in lemma 2.1 associated to two
dierent conformal representatives. then

(2.7)
for a function  on m  [0, ) whose expansion at r = 0 consists only of even powers of r up
through and including the rn+1 term.

r = re

proof. we have r = er where  is determined by (2.2), which in this case becomes

(2.8)

2r + r(2

r + |dm |2

gr) = 0.

the taylor expansion of  is determined inductively by dierentiating this equation at r = 0.
clearly r = 0 at r = 0. consider the determination of k+1
r  resulting from dierentiating
(2.8) an even number k times and setting r = 0. the term 2
r gets dierentiated k  1 times, so
one of the two factors ends up dierentiated an odd number of times, so by induction vanishes
at r = 0. now |dm |2
r ij, so the k  1 dierentiations must be split between the three
factors, so one of the factors must receive an odd number of dierentiations. when an odd
number of derivatives hits a i, the result again vanishes by induction. but by (2.4) and (2.5),
so long as k  1 < n, the odd derivatives of gr vanish at r = 0.

gr = gij

we will calculate near m the minimal surface equation for a submanifold of (x, g+). we

begin by deriving the minimal surface equation for a graph in a riemannian manifold.

let (x, u) denote coordinates in rm  rl, let g be a metric on rm  rl, and let y denote
the graph {u = u(x)}. then g restricts to y to the metric h given in the coordinates x on y
by

(2.9)

h = g + 2g(u

where the indices after a comma indicate coordinate dierentiation. the area of y is a =

r det h dx, so a = 1

2 r det h hh dx. since

it follows that y is stationary for area i u satises

let now y k+1 be a submanifold of our conformally compact einstein manifold (x, g+), where

of n, coordinates (x, u) for m may be chosen, where 1    k and 1    n  k, so that
n = {u = 0} and so that x  u on n with respect to a metric in the conformal innity of
g+. under the identication discussed above, the choice of such a metric determines an extension
of the x and u to a neighborhood of m, and together with r these form a coordinate system
on x. we consider submanifolds y which in these coordinates may be written as a graph

{u = u(x, r)}. the minimal surface equation for y is therefore given by (2.10), where however
x must be replaced by (x, r) and g by g+. set h = r2h and l = log(det h). recalling (2.3)
and writing simply g for gr, the minimal surface equation for y becomes m(u) = 0, where

consider now the inductive determination of the expansion of u = u(x, r) from the equation
m(u) = 0, beginning with the initial condition u(x, 0) = 0. since the coordinates were chosen
so that g = 0 on n, the representative gij for the conformal structure decomposes at u =
r = 0 into two pieces g and g. upon setting r = 0 and using the initial condition, all
terms on the right hand side of (2.11) vanish except for the rst, and one obtains ur = 0
at r = 0. thus a minimal y must intersect the boundary orthogonally. using this, one
deduces that all terms on the right hand side of (2.11) are o(r2) except the rst and third,
2 ggg,
at r = 0. of course when k = 0 there are no unprimed indices so that this equation reads
0 = 0, recovering the fact familiar from hyperbolic geometry that at the boundary a geodesic
may have any asymptotic curvature measured using the smooth metric g.

so that (rr  (k + 1))(cid:16)h

inductively, suppose that v has been determined so that m(v) = o(rm1). set u = v + wrm,
where w is to be determined. then it is not hard to see that (supressing the raising and lowering
of indices) m(u) = m(v) + m(m  k  2)wrm1 + o(rm). it follows that so long as m < k + 2
then w is uniquely determined. when m = k + 2, w is formally undetermined and one must
include a rk+2 log r term in u if the corresponding m(v) is not actually already o(rk+2).
since by (2.4) and (2.5) the metric gij is even in r to high order, it follows by staring at (2.11)
that the expansion determined for u will also be even in r up to the rk+2 term. (alternatively,
2 as a new variable and observe that (2.11) remains regular.) when k is
one may introduce r
odd, the same reasoning shows that the rk+2 log r term in u mentioned above does not occur,

1

7

but instead the parity is broken at this point and u may have a formally undetermined rk+2
term. thus we have for k odd

(2.14)

u = u(2)r2 + (even powers) + u(k+1)rk+1 + u(k+2)rk+2 + . . . ,

and for k even

(2.15)

u = u(2)r2 + (even powers) + u(k)rk + vrk+2 log r + u(k+2)rk+2 + . . . ,

where the u(j) and v are functions of x, all of which are locally determined except for u(k+2).

the induced metric h on y is given by (2.9) with x replaced by (x, r) and g by g+. since
the irregularities in gr occur at order n and those in u at order k + 2, one concludes that up to
terms vanishing to order greater than k, the expansions of h and hrr have only even terms
in r and that of hr has only odd terms. thus the volume form dvy = det h dxdr takes the
form

(2.16)

dvy = rk1(cid:2)v(0) + v(2)r2 + (even powers) + v(k)rk + . . .(cid:3) dvn dr,

where the . . . indicates terms vanishing to higher order and dvn denotes the volume form on
n with respect to the chosen conformal representative on the boundary. all indicated v(j) are
locally determined functions on n and v(k) = 0 if k is odd.

consider now the asymptotics of areag+(y  {r > }) as   0. fix a small number r0 and
express area(y  {r > }) = c +ry {<r<r0} dvy . by (2.16) we obtain for k odd

area(y  {r > }) = c0k + c2k+2 + (even powers) + ck11 + ck + o(1)

(2.17)

and for k even

(2.18)

area(y  {r > }) = c0k + c2k+2 + (even powers) + ck22 + d log

+ ck + o(1).

observe that

(2.19)

d = zn

v(k) dvn .

proposition 2.3. if k is odd, then ck is independent of the special dening function. if k is
even, then d is independent of the special dening function.

proof. let r and r be two special dening functions. on y , (2.7) becomes

(2.20)

r = re(x,u(x,r),r).

from lemma 2.2 and (2.14), (2.15), we see that the expansion of e(x,u(x,r),r) at r = 0 has only
even powers of r up through and including the rk+1 term. so (2.20) can be solved for r to give
r = rb(x, r) on y , where the expansion of b also has only even powers of r up through the
rk+1 term. it is important to note that in this relation the x still refers to the identication
associated with r.

set (x, ) = b(x, ). then on y , r >  is equivalent to r > (x, ), so

areag+(y  {r > })  areag+(y  {r > }) = zn z 



dvy =

since b(x, ) is even through terms of order k + 1 in , it follows that this expression has no
constant term as   0. similarly, when k is even, the r1 term in (2.21) contributes log b(x, ),
so there is no log 1

 term as   0.

as explained in the introduction, we dene the renormalized volume of y to be ar(y ) = ck.
the lemma says that ar(y ) is conformally invariant if k is odd. this is not so if k is even. for
k even, the variation in ck under a conformal change is the constant term in the expansion of
(2.21). it is clear from the local determination of the v(j) and of the expansion of b(x, ) that
this anomaly takes the form of the integral over n of a locally determined expression.

the anomaly for surface observables

as described in the introduction, the anomaly can be extracted rather trivially for k = 0.
so the rst example that really illustrates this computation is k = 2. in the remainder of the
paper, we compute the anomaly as well as the log term coecient d for k = 2.

using (2.9) with g again replaced by g+ and x by (x, r) and recalling h = r2h, one concludes

that the induced metric on y satises

by (2.19) we obtain for the log term coecient

8d = zn (cid:0)|h|2 + 4gp(cid:1) dvn .

by proposition 2.3, this quantity is an invariant of the conformal structure on m and the
submanifold n. in conformally at spaces it is known in the mathematical literature as the
willmore functional of n and its conformal invariance is well-known. a problem that has
received much attention is that of minimizing the willmore functional over all embeddings of a
2-manifold of xed topological type. in the physics literature, as noted in [16], this functional
has been called the rigid string action [18].

to calculate the anomaly, let gij = e2gij be a second representative for the conformal innity,
where   c (m). the associated dening functions r and r are related by r = er, where 
solves (2.8) and  =  on m. dierentiation of (2.8) gives rr =  1

solving the equation r = e(x,u(x,r),r)r for r gives r = rb(x, r), where b = e and

(x, r) = (x, 0) +

as previously observed, if c2 and c2 denote the constant terms in (2.18), then c2  c2 is the
constant term in (2.21). by (2.22), this is the same as the constant term in

zn (cid:20)

(|h|2 + 4gp) log b(x, )(cid:21) dvn ,

which is easily calculated to give

proposition 2.4. when k = 2, the anomaly is given by

8(c2  c2) = zn h(|h|2 + 4gp)  2h 

+ 2iii dvn .

it is interesting to observe that the linearization in  of this anomaly involves derivatives of

terms which do not arise from the log term in (2.18) upon rescaling .

we would like to thank charles feerman and tatiana toro for helpful discussions.
