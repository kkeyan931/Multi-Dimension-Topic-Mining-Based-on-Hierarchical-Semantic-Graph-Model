(19) may rephrase equivalence regular chiral large non chiral transformations saying eect gauge transformation generated equivalent one chiral transformation generated dual , . term dual understood sense vortex-like congurations (remember angular), transformed coulomb congurations (i.e., potential charge distribution). course, picture also holds way around: singular chiral pure gauge eld equivalent regular non-chiral pure gauge eld, thus gauged away! fermions free case. reason asymmetry case original one one usually regulates jacobian using operator 6d. general choice would put cases similar footing. 3 abelian case = 3 consider generating functional (1), = 3 case. (hermitian) matrices satisfy relations = + , (20) 8 denotes identity matrix. decomposition slightly dierent, since general con- guration three independent components. shall use scalar eld pseudovector , = + . (21) decomposition (21) apparently includes 1 + 3 = 4 components right hand side. note, however, insensitive transformations + , (22) reduce one actual number components. fact impose gauge condition , natural choice lorentz condition = 0 , (23) shall adopt. may write curl term (21) gradient scalar eld , course singularities = . = 2 = 2 = f (24) (25) whenever f 6= 0. integrating along curve starting point p innity, may write (x) (xp ) = z x xp . fermionic action would sf = z d3x  (26) (27) fermions coupled (singular) pure gauge eld. singu- lar decoupling transformations formally two- dimensional case (6) (x) = exp(x) (x) = (x) exp . (28) 9 introduce regular innitesimal transformations exactly way two dimensional case. three dimensional analog (12) 6  = 0 . thus led consider innitesimal regular transformations (x) = 6 (x)(x) (x) = (x) 6 (x) . (29) (30) innitesimal regular version decoupling singular transfor- mations (28). present = 3 case, shall perform innitesimal decoupling transformations, allow us compute v.e.v. fermion currents j = iz/a. need consider variation z z = z exp(cid:20)z ddx (6 + i(6a+ 6a)(cid:21) . (31) now, innitesimal change fermion elds like (30) used elimi- nate action. change will, likely, produce non trivial jacobian j, z = jz j = exp(cid:18)z d3x g(cid:19) . (32) (33) obtain connection a, note relation (21) a, write = , (34) denotes transverse components. shall connect jacobian (33) associated general gauge eld variation (i.e. including longitudinal components) associated , j  = exp(cid:18)z d3x a(cid:19) . (35) 10 end, note thought variation gauge corresponding longitudinal component xed zero. includ- ing 3 possible dierent choices component gives twice general variation looking for. thus, factor 3/2 included, g = 3 2 a . (36) let us compute anomalous jacobian associated transfor- mations (30). indeed, transformations, anomalous jacobian reecting change fermionic integration measure j = jj j j .
