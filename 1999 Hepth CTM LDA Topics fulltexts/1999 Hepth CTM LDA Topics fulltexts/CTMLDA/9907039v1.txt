abstract

we study an integrable quantum eld theory of a single stable particle with

an innite number of resonance states. the exact smatrix of the model is

expressed in terms of jacobian elliptic functions which encode the resonance
poles inherently. in the limit l  0, with l the modulus of the jacobian elliptic
function, it reduces to the sinhgordon smatrix. we address the problem

of computing the form factors of the model by studying their monodromy

and recursive equations. these equations turn out to possess innitely many

solutions for any given number of external particles. this innite spectrum of

solutions may be related to the irrational nature of the underlying conformal

field theory reached in the ultraviolet limit. we also discuss an elliptic

version of the thermal massive ising model which is obtained by a particular

value of the coupling constant.

1 introduction

the search for solvable but realistic models in theoretical physics has always resulted

in valuable byproducts. in this respect, the subject of twodimensional relativistic

quantum field theories (qft) has played a prominent role in the last decade, since

numerous and important results have been achieved on nonperturbative aspects of

strongly interacting systems. remarkable applications to phenomena which occur

in statistical or condensed matter systems where the dimensionality is eectively

reduced have been made (see for instance [1, 2, 3]). in addition, the large variety

of twodimensional exactly solvable models  obtained both in the scaleinvariant

regime described by conformal field theories or along the integrable directions

which depart from them  have often been the theorists ideal playground for un-

derstanding (at least qualitatively) phenomena which take place in highenergy

physics. the smatrix approach proposed by zamolodchikov [4] for studying the

massive regime of integrable renormalization group ows has been particularly

successful in answering important questions concerning the spectrum of qft, the

particle interactions and the behaviour of correlators of their local elds.

the aim of this paper is to address the analysis of one of the most striking aspects

of scattering experiments, i.e. the occurrence of resonances. the physical eects

induced by resonances have been the subject of some interesting publications in the

past. al. zamolodchikov, for instance, has shown in [5] that a single resonance state

can induce a remarkable pattern of roaming renormalization group trajectories

which have the property to pass by very closely all minimal unitary models of

conformal field theory, nally ending in the massive phase of the ising model.

another model, this time with an innite number of resonance states, has also been

considered by a. zamolodchikov in relation with a qft which is characterised

by a dynamical z4 symmetry [6]: this is a theory with multichannel scattering

amplitudes which are forced by the yangbaxter equations to be expressed in terms

1

of jacobian elliptic functions.

the model we propose in this paper is quite close in spirit to the latter one

by a. zamolodchikov [6] but has the important advantage of being simpler and

therefore amenable for a more detailed analysis of its oshell properties. more

specically, we will consider an integrable qft made of a stable, selfconjugated
scalar excitation a of mass m but with an innite series of resonance states which
emerge as virtual unstable particles in the scattering amplitudes. as a function

of the rapidity variable, its twobody smatrix is expressed in terms of jacobian

elliptic functions, which present a periodicity along the real axis. this causes the

appeareance of the innite number of resonances.

in ordinary fourdimensional

qft, resonances are responsible for sharp peaks observed in the total crosssection

of the scattering processes as a function of the energy or equivalently in abrupt

changes of the phaseshifts.

in twodimensional integrable qft, on the other

hand, production processes are forbidden and therefore the concept itself of total

cross section is not particularly usueful. we will show, however, that resonances

are associated to rapid jumps of the phaseshift.

the presence of an innite number of resonance states deeply aects the physical

properties of the system, the analytic structure of the smatrix and in particular

the shortdistance behaviour of the correlators. this can been seen by studying the

spectral series representations of the correlators, based on the form factors of the

theory. concerning the analysis of the form factors themselves, the main novelty

consists in the innite number of solutions of the form factors equations which can

be found in this case. the innite spectrum of operators dened by these solutions

may be related to the irrational nature of the underlying conformal field theory

reached in the ultraviolet limit.

the paper is organised as follows: in sect. 2 we discuss the general properties of

our model. its smatrix is the simplest example with an innite series of resonance
states. since it reduces to the sinhgordon smatrix in the limit l  0 (l is the

2

module of the jacobi elliptic functions), the qft dened by such an smatrix will

be referred to as elliptic sinhgordon model (esg). in sect. 3 we briey outline

the main properties of the form factors of our relativistic integrable qft and

discuss the new features which arise in a theory with double periodicity. section

4 is devoted to the analysis of the form factors of the elliptic ising model, i.e. a

model with innite resonance states which reduces to the usual ising model in the
limit l  0. this model may be obtained by a particular analytic continuation of
the coupling constant of the esg model. in sect. 5 we address the computation of

the form factors of the elliptic sinhgordon model: we present the computation

of the minimal form factor f () and investigate its analytic structure. by using

the functional equation satised by f (), we derive the recursive equations of the

form factors and obtain their rst solutions. the main result of this section is that

the solutions of the ff equations for a given number of external particles span an

innite dimensional vector space. in sect. 6 we present our conclusions. the paper

also contains three appendices: appendix a presents useful mathematical identities

used in the text, appendix b contains the derivation of the fourier series of the s

matrix and nally appendix c presents the calculation of the minimal form factor

of the elliptic sinhgordon model.

2 elastic s-matrix with resonance states

we consider a twodimensional integrable qft describing a stable, selfconjugated
particle a of mass m. this theory is assumed to be invariant under a z2 symmetry
realised by a  a. its onshell properties are encoded into its elastic smatrix.
in virtue of integrability, the smatrix satises the factorization condition [7], there-

fore it is sucient to focalise only on the twobody elastic scattering process. let

s = (p1 + p2)2 be the mandelstam variable of the scattering process and s(s) the

twobody elastic scattering amplitude of the particle a. the function s(s) is usu-

3

ally expected to have two elastic branchcuts along the real axis at the twoparticle
thresholds s  0 and s  4m2. these branchcuts can be unfolded as follows. let
 be the rapidity variable which parameterises the relativistic dispersion relations

e = m cosh 

;

p = m sinh  .

(2.1)

the mandelstam variables s and t of the twobody scattering processes are then

expressed by

s = (p1 + p2)2 = 2m2 [1 + cosh 12]
t = (p1  p2)2 = 2m2 [1 + cosh(i  12)]

;

.

(2.2)

(12 = 1  2). hence the upper and lower edges of the branchcut which starts at
s = 4m2 are mapped onto the positive and negative real semiaxes of  respectively.
the upper and lower edges of the other branchcut are conversely mapped onto the

positive and negative values of  along the line im = i. the smatrix s(12)

becomes a meromorphic function in the 12plane.

it satises the unitarity and

crossing symmetry conditions

s()s() = 1 ;
s(i  ) = s() .

(2.3)

these equations automatically imply that s() is a periodic function along the

imaginary axis of the rapidity variable, i.e.

s( + 2i) = s() .

(2.4)

this periodicity simply expresses the doublesheet structure of the riemann sur-

face with respect to the mandelstam variable s where the scattering amplitude is
meromorphic. the physical sheet can be taken then as the strip 0  im   and
the unphysical one as the strip i  im  0.

let us now assume that s() also presents a periodic behaviour along the real

axis of the rapidity variable  with a period t , i.e.

s() = s( + t ) .

(2.5)

4

this equation, combined with the analyticity properties of s(), has farreaching

consequences. in fact, the simultaneous validity of the two periodicity conditions

(2.4) and (2.5) forces s() to be an elliptic function. accordingly, the plane of

the rapidity variable  becomes tiled in terms of the periodic cells of the function

s() (figure 1.a). on the plane of the mandelstam variable s the smatrix is not

periodic. however, the existence of a double periodicity on the plane induces an

innite swapping between the two edges of the elastic branchcuts on the splane.
the swaps are located at the innite set of values sn = 2m2(1 + cosh(nt /2)) and
sn = 2m2(1 + cosh(i  nt /2)) for the (4m2, +) and (, 0) branchcuts,
respectively. in fact, take ( t
2 ) as fundamental interval of the real periodicity in
 and consider, for instance, the branchcut (4m 2, +) in the variable s. at the
initial location s = 4m 2 ( = 0) the two edges join together. starting from  = 0

2 , t

and moving onto the negative values of , we proceed along the lower edge of the
branch cut, as far as  >  t
2 . when this value is crossed and  reaches the region
(t, t
2 ), due to the identication   +t , we are brought back to positive values
of , 0 <  < t
2 . on the other hand, this interval for  parameterises the upper
edge of the branch cut. therefore, at  =  t
2 a rst swap of the two edges of the
branch cut has occured. if now  decreases, we keep moving along the upper edge

as far as  is greater than zero. when the rapidity crosses this value (now identied

with  = t ) a second swap occurs and the original conguration of the two edges

is restored. the pattern described in details for 0 <  < t , indeed reproduces

itself with period t in the rapidity variable. in particular, since the point  = 0 is

identied with an innite sequence of points n = nt , the two branches return to

the initial joined conguration an innite number of times. for the same reason,
the swap at  =  t
2 . the situation
is completly analogous for the branchcut of the tchannel which originally lies on

2 is reproduced at every value 2n+1 = (2n + 1) t

the real negative semiaxis of the s variable. hence, altogether in the plane of the

mandelstam variable s we have the analytic structure of the smatrix shown in

5

figure 1.b.

if s() is an elliptic function, it must have poles and zeros, unless it is a constant.

however, the existence of poles should not spoil the causality properties of the

scattering theory. from a mathematical point of view, this is equivalent to requiring

a further condition on the analytic structure of s(), namely that this function

should not have poles with a real part within the physical sheet.

it is now easy to determine the simplest smatrix which satises all of the above

constraints, i.e. the unitarity and crossing equations (2.3), the periodicity equation

(2.5) and the causality condition. it may be written as

s(, a) =

,

(2.6)

(cid:17)

i

dn(cid:16) k(+ia)
dn(cid:16) k(ia)

i

(cid:17)
(cid:17)

where sn(x ), cn(x ) and dn(x ) are the jacobian elliptic functions and k is the com-

plete elliptic integral, both of modulus l (see appendix a for a review of the main

properties of the jacobian elliptic functions and some of their useful identities). by

using the addition theorems (a.6), the above function can be equivalently expressed

as

s(, a) =

sn(cid:0) 2ki
sn(cid:0) 2ki

 (cid:1) + sn(2ka)
 (cid:1)  sn(2ka)

.

(2.7)

exploiting some of the identities listed in appendix a, it is easy to check the validity

of eqs. (2.3). moreover, the smatrix satises the real periodicity condition (2.5)

with period

t = 

k
k

,

(2.8)

where k is the complete elliptic integral of the the complementary modulus l =
(1  l2)1/2. the parameter a entering the expression (2.6) may be regarded as the
coupling constant of the model. it must be selected so as not to introduce poles in

the smatrix which have a real part in the physical strip. as we will see below (eq.

(2.11)), this is ensured by taking a to be a real positive number in the interval [0, 1].

as a matter of fact, this interval can be further reduced in virtue of an additional

6

property of the smatrix (2.7). in fact, the smatrix (2.7) is invariant under the
replacement a  1  a,

s(, a) = s(, 1  a) ,

(2.9)

free theory, whereas the point a = 1

so that a can be restricted to the interval [0, 1

2]. for a = 0 we have s = 1, i.e. a
2 may be regarded as the selfdual point of this
scattering theory. in the following, unless explicitly stated, a will be always taken
as 0  a  1
2.

notice that by taking the limit l  0, the real period t goes to innity and the

smatrix (2.7) reduces to the one of the sinhgordon model [8]

sshg(, a) =

sinh   i sin a
sinh  + i sin a

.

(2.10)

for this reason, the qft dened by the smatrix (2.7) may be simply referred to

as the elliptic sinhgordon model (esg).

let us consider the analytic structure of the smatrix (2.6), i.e. the pattern of

its poles and zeros. poles are either those of the numerator or come from the zeros

of the denominator in (2.6). conversely, zeros are either those of the numerator or

come from the poles of the denominator. using the results listed in table 1 and

taking into account possible cancellations of poles against zeros, we are left with

the following innite set of simple poles and simple zeros

poles :

zeros :

m,n =  ia + 2mi + nt ;
m,n = ia + (2m + 1)i + nt

m,n = ia + 2mi + nt ;
m,n =  ia + (2m + 1)i + nt

(2.11)

(2.12)

where m, n  z.

t

by choosing in the  plane the rectangle with vertices (i  t

2 ,i 
2 ,i + t
2 ) as a fundamental domain, the analytic structure of the smatrix is
shown in figure 2, with two zeros and two poles along the imaginary axis and

2 , i + t

7

then repeated on the other cells of the plane by periodicity. hence, the simplest

smatrix with double periodicity is realised by an elliptic function of order two.

with the above choice of the values of a, the poles of the scattering amplitude

which have a real part in the plane all lie on the unphysical sheet. instead in the

physical sheet there are only zeros. the poles on the unphysical sheet with a real
part correspond to a series of resonance states rn with masses and decay widths
given respectively by

mres(n) = 2m cosh(cid:0)n t
res(n) = 2m(cid:12)(cid:12)sinh(cid:0)n t

2(cid:1) cos(cid:0) a
2 (cid:1) ;
2 (cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) .
2(cid:1) sin(cid:0) a

(2.13)

in the limit when the modulus l of the jacobian elliptic function goes to zero (i.e.
t  ), the mass of all resonances becomes innitely heavy and therefore these
states completly decouple from the theory.

it is also useful to express the smatrix (2.6) in an exponential form, a repre-

sentation which will result particularly convenient for the computation of the form

factors of the theory presented in the next sections. as shown in details in appendix
b, in the strip 0  |im| < a we have the following equivalent representation of
the smatrix of the esg model

(2.17)

by using the expression (2.16) we can read the phaseshift () of the model

dened by

s() = e2i()

.

(2.18)

the phaseshift is obviously a quantity which is dened modulus multiplies of .

therefore, by adding to () a convenient multiplies of  we can always consider

() to be a monotonic function of . when  approaches the locations of the

resonances ren = nt , the phaseshift () sharply increases its value by  (see

figure 3).

a particularly simple but fascinating example of integrable theory with an in-
nite number of resonances is given by the smatrix s = 1, when expressed in the
form (2.15). the phaseshift of such a model can be taken as the staircase function

with values given by all multiplies of 

2 and jumps localised in correspondence to the
points n = nt /2 (figure 4). a way to understand this unexpectedly rich structure
hidden in s = 1 is to notice that the scattering theory described by (2.15) can
be obtained as a particular analytic continuation of the elliptic expression (2.7).
indeed, the smatrix (2.7) approaches the value 1 every time the parameter a
takes one of the innite values

ac = m + (2n + 1)i

t
2

,

m  n, n  z

(2.19)

corresponding to the locations of the poles of sn(2ka). at these critical values of

a, the innite number of poles and zeros of (2.7) cancel each other over the entire

9

plane, giving rise to the constant function s = 1. in figure 5 this pattern is
described in details for the simplest choice ac = i t
2 . in this case, for a theory
dened at an innitesimal displacement a = ac +  from the critical value ac, the

location of poles and zeros is

m,n = (2n + 1) t

(2.21)

where m, n  z. as shown in figure 5, in the limit   0 cancellations occur
between ()

in particular,

in this limit inherits all the analytic structure of the esg model.

the innite number of odd values 2n+1 = (2n + 1)t /2 corresponding to rapid

increasings of the phaseshift can be interpreted as associated to resonance states

the smatrix becomes

s()

(2.22)

which corresponds to the diagram in figure 6. in general, at the poles ij = iuk

corresponding to a bound state ak produced by the fusion of two particles ai and

aj, the smatrix satises

(  iuk

(2.23)

where k

ij is the threeparticle vertex on massshell. therefore, comparing eqs.

(2.22) and (2.23), we can interpret the resonances rn as bound states of the

particle a but on the second sheet, with the threeparticle vertex on massshell

given by rn

aa = i. the imaginary value of the threeparticle vertex indicates
that the qft presents some nonunitary features. as bound states of the z2

odd particle a, the resonance states rn are even under the z2 symmetry of the

10

model. near the values  = 2n+1 the smatrix behaves as in eq. (2.22) but with

an opposite sign for the residue. these poles correspond to resonance states in the

crossed channel.

the even values 2n = nt corresponding to the other rapid increasings of the

phase shift have, on the other hand, a dierent physical interpretation. they do not

come from genuine bound state resonances but simply correspond to kinematic

resonances associated to the innite replicae of the initial jointpoint of the elastic

branchcuts on the splane (see figure 1.b).

the qft theory described by the smatrix (2.15) will be referred to as the el-

liptic ising model (eim). the detailed study of its operator content will be discussed

in section 4.

3 form factors in integrable qft

the onshell dynamics of a system is encoded into its smatrix. in order to go o

shell and compute the correlation functions of the model, one can use their spectral

series representation. this means that we need to compute the matrix elements

of the quantum elds between asymptotic states.

it is sucient to consider the

following matrix elements, known as form factors (ff) [11, 12]

f o
n (1, 2, . . . , n) = h0 | o(0, 0) | 1, 2, . . . , niin .

(3.1)

in this section we will briey outline the main properties of the ff in a generic two

dimensional integrable qft and we will comment on some features which arise in

the case of an smatrix with a real period. a more detailed discussion of these

features is postponed to the next sections. for simplicity we only consider the ff
of scalar and hermitian operators o.

the ff of a qft are known to be severely constrained by the relativistic sym-

11

metries. first of all, they only depend on the dierence of the rapidities ij

f o
n (1, 2, . . . , n) = f o

n (12, 13, . . . , ij, . . .) , i < j .

(3.2)

except for pole singularities due to the one-particle intermediate states in all

sub-channels, the form factors fn are expected to be analytic functions inside the

physical strip 0 < imij < . moreover, they satisfy the monodromy equations

[11, 12]

f o
n (1, .., i, i+1, .., n) = f o

n (1, .., i+1, i, .., n)s(i  i+1) ;

(3.3)

n (1 + 2i, .., n1, n) = e2i f o
f o

n (2, . . . , n, 1) .

the parameter  is the index of mutual locality of the operator o with respect to
the particle state a ( = 0, 1/2 for local and semilocal operators, respectively).

in the simplest case n = 2, the above equations become

2 ()

= f o

f o
2 (i  ) = e2i f o
f o

2 ()s() ,

2 (i + ) .

(3.4)

by exploiting the factorization properties of integrable qft, the general solution

of (3.3) can be found by making the ansatz

f o

n (1, . . . , n) = kn(1, . . . , n) yi<j

fmin(ij) ,

(3.5)

where fmin() is a solution of eqs. (3.4), analytic in 0 < im  < . the remaining

factors kn therefore satisfy the monodromy equations with s = 1, i.e. they are

completely symmetric, 2i-periodic functions of the i. moreover, they contain all

the physical poles expected in the form factor under investigation.

in the case of a period smatrix, the general solutions fn of the monodromy

equations are not apriori constrained to have any real periodicity in the rapidity

variables. this can be easily seen from their parameterization (3.5); the monodromy

equations with s = 1 which determine the functions kn do not contain any infor-

mations about the periodic nature of the dynamics under consideration. however,

12

for the twoparticle ff the solutions of eqs. (3.4) may be chosen to satisfy the extra

condition

f o
2 ( + t ) = f o

2 () .

(3.6)

in order to prove it, consider the rst of eqs. (3.4) and make the substitution  
 + t . since s() does not change under this shift in , if f2() is a solution of

eqs. (3.4), then f2( + t ) is also a solution

f o
2 ( + t ) = s()f o

2 (  t ) .

by taking the ratio of eq. (3.7) and the rst of (3.4) we have

f o

2 ( + t )
f o

2 ()

=

f o
2 (  t )
f o
2 ()

.

(3.7)

(3.8)

therefore, if we assume f o( + t ) to be proportional to f o(), i.e. f o( + t ) =
af o(), then eq. (3.8) implies a2 = 1, i.e. a = 1. in particular, for a = 1 there
is a doubling of the real periodicity in the twoparticle form factor with respect

to the smatrix.

it is simple to obtain an explicit t periodic solution of eqs. (3.4) in the case of

a local operator ( = 0) when the t periodic smatrix is expressed in the form

s() = exp"i

(3.10)

let us consider now the pole singularities of the ff. they give rise to a set of

recursive equations for the fn which may be particularly important for their explicit

determination. as functions of the rapidity dierences ij, the ff present in general

two kinds of simple poles. the rst family of singularities come from kinematical

13

poles located at ij = i. they correspond to the one-particle intermediate state in

a subchannel of three-particle states which, in turn, is related to a crossing process

of the elastic s-matrix. the corresponding residues give rise to a recursive equation

between the n-particle and the (n + 2)particle form factors [12]

(3.11)

for a theory with a real periodic smatrix we still expect the appearance of kine-

matic poles located at ij = i with residue given by the above equation, whose

physical origin is the same as in the nonperiodic case (see, for instance, the dis-

cussion in [17]). however, in this case the presence of a periodic smatrix on the

r.h.s. of eq. (3.11) gives additional constraints on the behaviour of the ff near the
pole. precisely, if we perform the shift i  i + t , i = 1,   , n in eq. (3.11), the
r.h.s. is left invariant due to the t periodicity of s and the traslation invariance of
fn (the same conclusion is also obtained by shifting    + t and    + t on
n+2 in (   ) = i has to
the l.h.s. of (3.11)). hence, in this case the residue of f o
be a t periodic function of the n + 1 rapidities , 1,   , n. although a sucient
condition to implement this requirement would be fn(1, ..., n) periodic in all its

variables, this is not a necessary condition as we will show in sect. 5 by providing

explicit examples.

in fn there may also be another family of poles related to the presence of bound

states. these poles are located at the values of ij where two particles fuse into a

ij be one of such poles associated to the bound state ak in

third one. let ij = iuk
the channel ai  aj and k
the residue equation for the smatrix is given in (2.23) and, correspondingly, for

ij the three-particle vertex on mass-shell. in this case,

fn we obtain [12]

genuine bound states. in fact, a bound state pole in the smatrix at ij = uk

violation of causality. however, by considering the resonances as bound states

be associated to an innite chain of poles at ij = uk

on the second sheet, the above equation may be nevertheless used to extract some

useful informations.

in general, the ff of real periodic models are then expected to be ruled only by

the recursive equations coming from the kinematical singularities, eq. (3.11). in the

particular case of the esg model, this implies the complete decoupling between the

two chains of ff for even or odd number of particles. this reects the z2 symmetry

of the model which can be used to classify its operators.

finally, we remind that in the usual nonperiodic scattering theories the ff

may be further restricted by extra conditions related to their asymptotic behaviour

[12, 13] and their cluster properties [10, 14, 15]. these conditions are often sucient

to determine uniquely the solutions of the recursive equations for each choice of
the operator o. in the periodic case, as it will be clear later, we deal instead with
periodic functions for which the lack of asymptotic extra conditions leads eventually

to an anavoidable arbitrariness in the determination of the ff.

4 form factors of ising model realizations

the qft dened by the smatrix s = 1 is usually identied with the thermal
deformation of the critical ising model with central charge c = 1
2 [16]. in fact, the
solution of the ff equations in the space of hyperbolic functions permits the full

reconstruction of all correlators of this statistical model and a precise check of its

ultraviolet limit [11, 17, 18]. in order to point out the important dierences coming

from an elliptic interpretation of this scattering theory, it is worth summarising rst

the main results for the correlation functions of the standard thermal ising model.

15

4.1 the standard thermal ising model

with s = 1, the simplest solutions of eqs. (3.4) in the space of hyperbolic functions
are given by

fmin() =


f () = sinh 
2 ,
f () = tanh 
2 ,

if  = 0 ;

if  = 1

2 .

(4.1)

the kinematical recursive equations for the ff are particularly simple in this theory

 i lim



(   )f o

n+2(  + i, , 1, 2, . . . , n) =(cid:0)1  e2i (1)n(cid:1) fn(1, . . . , n) .

(4.2)

hence, the ff of local operators ( = 0) do not have kinematical poles when n

is an even integer whereas their residue is independent of the number of external

particles when n is an odd integer. the situation is reversed for the ff of semilocal

operators ( = 1

2).

all elds are naturally divided into two classes. the rst consists of z2 even,

local or z2 odd, semilocal elds. local operators of this class have nonzero ff

only between states with a nite number of external particles. the rst represen-

tative of this class is given by the trace of the stressenergy tensor (x). this is a

local eld, proportional to the energy operator (x) of the thermal ising model

(x) = 2 (x) ,

(4.3)

where  = (t  tc) is the displacement of the temperature from its critical value,
related to the mass of the model by m = 2 . this operator has only a nonzero
twoparticle ff, given by

f (1  2) = 2m2 f (1  2)

f (i)

.

(4.4)

the second class consists of the z2 odd, local or z2 even, semilocal operators,

as for instance the magnetization operator (x) and the disorder operator (x). in

the hightemperature phase of the model, (x) is an odd, local operator. its ff

give rise to the innite sequence f 

2n+1 on all odd numbers of external particles.

16

taking into account the kinematical poles at ij = i, the explicit expression of

these ff is given by

2n+1

f +

2n+1 = h2n+1

f (ij) .

(4.5)

yi<j

h2n+1 is a normalization constant, given by h2n+1 = inh1, where h1 is the one
point ff, h0|(0)|ai = h1.

the disorder eld (x), in the hightemperature phase, is an even semilocal

eld. its ff extend on an innite sequence f 

2n on all even numbers of asymptotic

states and their expression is given by

2n

f 

2n = h2n

f (ij) ,

(4.6)

yi<j

with the normalization constant h2n = inh0 and h0 the vacuum expectation value
of this operator, h0|(0)|0i = h0. switching between the high and low temperature
phases, the z2 odd and even elds (x) and (x) simply swap their role.

the above explicit expressions of the ff allow to obtain exact informations on

the thermal ising model. we can compute, in particular, its correlation functions

and related quantities. the simplest correlator is given by

g(x) = h(x)(0)i ,

(4.7)

(x  mr). by inserting a complete set of intermediate states, it can be expressed
as

g(x) =

1

0 (x)(cid:3) ,

2

ex(cosh 1+cosh 2) =

(4.8)

where ki(x) are the ordinary bessel functions. in the ultraviolet limit x  0, the
above expression reduces to

g(x)  m2

r2

,

(4.9)

from which we can read the anomalous dimension of the energy operator in its

conformal limit,  = 1. the knowledge of g(x) also allows to determine the

17

central charge of the conformal eld theory which arises in its ultraviolet limit. to

this aim, we can use the ctheorem sum rule [20, 21]

cuv =

3

4z d2x|x|2 h(x)(0)i .

(4.10)

by inserting the explicit expression (4.8) of g(x), the above formula gives cuv = 1
2.
the same set of conformal data can also be extracted by looking at the ground

state energy of the theory on an innite cylinder of width r. the exact expression

is obtained by means of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) [22] and for the

eective central charge

we have [23]

the power series of the above expression should match with its evaluation in terms

and hh...ii denotes the conformal correlators on the cylinder.

since for the critical ising model min = 0 and the energy operator (r) is odd

under duality, we have cn = 0 for odd n. hence, eq. (4.12) xes the central charge

to be cuv = 1

2. moreover, from the comparison of the power series in (4.12) with the

in this equation e is the euler-mascheroni constant and (s) the riemann zeta function.

18

perturbative expansion (4.13), we have  = 1, in agreement with the determination

of this quantity obtained by the shortdistance limit of the correlator (4.8).

let us now consider the correlation functions of the z2 odd, local and even,

semilocal elds,

g(x) = h(r)(0)i ;
g+(x) = h(r)(0)i ,

where the sum runs on odd numbers for g+(x) and on even ones for g(x). as

shown in [17, 19], eq. (4.16) provides an integral representation of a particular so-

lution of the painleve equation. an exact analysis of this solution allows, in par-
ticular, to study its shortdistance limit x  0 with the result

g(x)

(4.17)

the above expression determines the anomalous dimensions of the z2 odd elds to

be  =  = 1
8.

the anomalous dimension of these elds can be equivalently extracted by means

of the  sumrule [14]

 = 

1

2hi z d2xh(x)(0)i .

(4.18)

this formula can be applied in the hightemperature phase to obtain the anomalous

dimension of the disorder eld and in the lowtemperature to obtain the anomalous

dimension of the magnetization operator. by inserting a complete set of states

between the two operators and noticing that the ff of (x) is dierent from zero

only on the twoparticle state, we have

(4.19)

it is worth mentioning that the anomalous dimension of these elds can be

also obtained by exploiting the formal analogy of expression (4.16) with a grand

canonical partition function (z, l) of a ctitious onedimensional gas in a box of
length l  log 2
this gas

2 [17, 18]. hence, by the state equation of

mr and fugacity z = 1

(z, l) = ep(z)l  (cid:18) 1

mr(cid:19)p(z)

,

(4.20)

the anomalous dimension is nothing but its pressure p(z) at z = 1

2 . in the nearest
neighborhood approximation of (z, l), the pressure p can be obtained as a solution

of the integral equation

2 =z +

dzep z |f2(z)|2 .

(4.21)

in the thermal ising model, the above formula provides an excellent approximation
of , i.e.   0.12529 [18].

4.2 form factors for the elliptic ising model

let us discuss now the form factors of the theory described by the smatrix
s = 1 but this time regarded as a periodic function of . as it is clear from
eq. (a.13), there is a complete arbitrariness in the choice of the periodic realization
of 1. instead of working with the smatrix (2.15) of period t , it is more convenient
to consider the following 2t periodic realization

 1 = exp"4i

+

xn=1

1

2n  1

sin(cid:18) (2n  1)

t

(cid:19)# ,

(4.22)

which leads to a simplication in the expressions of the form factors of the model,

without altering its physical content .

 in fact, one can always convert the expressions of the ff relative to the period 2t to those

relative to period t by multiplying them for even, 2i periodic functions which enter the general

solution of (4.23). for instance, the function sn(cid:16)i k

t (cid:17), solution of (4.23) with period 2t , can be

20

in what follows we will not address the problem of nding the most general

solutions of all ff equations relative to this theory. we will rather concentrate

our attention on particular classes of solutions which have the minimal analytic

structure compatible with all the constraints.

let us consider rst the minimal twoparticle form factors, solutions of the

equations

f () =  f () ;

f (i  ) = e2i f (i + ) .

(4.23)

they are determined up to arbitrary even, 2iperiodic and 2t (anti)periodic,

analytic functions of . this time we are looking for the simplest solution of these

equations in the space of elliptic functions. using the properties of the jacobian

elliptic functions listed in appendix a, it is easy to see that they are given by

fmin() =

f () = i

sn(cid:16)i k
t (cid:17)
dn(i k

t )

f () = i



t (cid:17)
sn(cid:16)i k
cn(i k

t )

,

,

if  = 0 ;

if  = 1

2 .

(4.24)




these expressions represent the simplest generalization of the standard results (4.1)

with no poles on the real axis and which accounts for the real periodicity of the
system under consideration, with the property fmin( + 2t ) = fmin(). their
analytic structure consists of the following set of simple zeros and poles:

transformed by means of the even, 2i periodic function hl sn2(cid:16)i k

t (cid:17) + 1i into the t periodic

solution

of the same equation.

zeros :

m,n = 2mi + 2nt ;

poles :

m,n = (2m + 1)i + (2n + 1)t ;

zeros :

m,n = 2mi + 2nt ;

poles :

m,n = (2m + 1)i + 2nt ,

(4.25)

with m, n  z. notice that f () has an innite sequence of poles at  = i + (2n +
1)t , located just at the edge of the second sheet. they correspond to the innite

sequence of the oneparticle intermediate states given by the resonances rn (see
the discussion at the end of section 2). on the contrary, the poles of f () located
at  = i + 2nt do not signal the presence of resonances but are simply related to

the innitely repeated pattern of the branch cut of the tchannel of the smatrix.

concerning the recursive equations satised by the ff, they are given by the

same equation (4.2) and therefore, as before, the operators fall into two dierent

sectors.

let us consider rst the form factors of the local z2 even or semilocal odd

operators, i.e. the ones which do not have poles at ij = i. their general expression

can be written in terms of the function f () and they are nonzero only on a nite

number of external states. let us consider, in particular, the ff of the trace

operator. even in the periodic case we assume this operator to be related to the

energy eld by eq. (4.3). its only nonvanishing ff is the one on the twoparticle

state which we assume to be

f (1  2)  h0|(0)|12i = 2m2 f (1  2)

f (i)

.

for the twopoint function of this operator we have

g(x) = h(r)(0)i =
2z d1
d2

22

ex(cosh 1+cosh 2) .

(4.26)

(4.27)

by using the variables y = 1

2(1  2), it can be written as

g(x) =

|f (i)|2 z +
4m4

0

dy|f (2y)|2k0(2x cosh y) .

(4.28)

plots of this correlation function for dierent values of the modulus l are shown in

figure 7.

let us discuss in more detail the large and the short distances behaviour of this

correlator. as evident from figure 7, the large distance behaviour of the correlator

(4.28) is essentially the same for all value of the period t and is ruled by the
mass gap m of the stable particle. this is conrmed by the analytic estimate of
g(x) for large values of x: the only parameter which contains informations on the

periodic structure of the theory (in terms of parameters of the elliptic functions) is

the normalization in front of the exponential decay

g(x) 

2

 (cid:0)m2 l k(cid:1)2 e2x

x2 + o(cid:0)e4x(cid:1) .

(4.29)

the situation is drastically dierent in the ultraviolet regime. while in the non

periodic case (l = 0) the twoparticle ff is expressed by the unbounded function
2 , for l 6= 0 it is instead a periodic, regular and limited function on the real

sinh 

axis which can always be bounded by a constant b, leading to

g(x)  4m4b2z +

0

dyk0(2x cosh y) = 2(cid:0)m2b(cid:1)2

k 2

0 (x) .

(4.30)

this inequality implies that for l 6= 0 g(x) cannot have a power law singularity
in its ultraviolet limit as, instead, it happens in the standard ising model (see eq.

(4.9)). hence the conclusion is simply that the anomalous dimension of the energy

operator changes discontinously from the value  = 1 (for l = 0) to  = 0 for all

other nite values of the module!

this result seems to give rise to an apparent paradox. in fact, one could argue

that the anomalous dimension of the energy operator can be equivalently extracted

 to obtain this result we have used eq.(6.663.1) of [24].

23

in terms of the tba equations by looking at the perturbative part of the ground

state energy. since this quantity is still given by the same eq. (4.12), it appears

that from the tba approach one would rather reach the previous conclusion, i.e.

 = 1. how can we conciliate this apparent mismatch of the values of  obtained

by the two dierent methods?

the solution to this puzzle is the following. first of all, notice that the tba

does not compute the central charge of the theory but rather provides the evaluation
of the eective central charge of the theory, c = c  24min. to compute directly
the central charge, we have instead to employ the ctheorem sumrule (4.10). the

result for the central charge of the elliptic ising model is reported in figure 8. this

gure shows that, by varying the period, the central charge of the model is no longer

2 but, on the contrary, takes any value between 0 and 1

c = 1
2, depending on the
module l. on the other hand, since the eective central charge c is always equal

to 1

2 for any value of the module l, there should be in the periodic realization of the
ising model an operator with conformal weight min < 0. hence, the underlying

conformal theory of the elliptic ising model is no longer unitary (and rational)

and consequently we have no reasons to argue that the perturbative coecients cn

vanish for n odd, as in the ising model. therefore, the matching of the conformal
perturbation theory in the presence of a eld with min 6= 0 with the corresponding
perturbative part of (4.12) gives  = 0, in agreement with the determination done

by looking at the ultraviolet limit of the correlator. for the limiting value l = 1,
we have min =  1
48 .

as already discussed, the ff of even, local operators inherit from the smatrix

the pole structure associated to the resonance states. these states are even under

the z2 symmetry of the model and therefore they couple directly to the operator .
we can extract the matrix elements h0|(0)|rni by formally applying the bound
state residue equation (3.12), with rn

aa = i (  0). as a result we have
=  h0|(0)|rni .

(4.31)

(1)n 22m2

l k

24

hence, h0|(0)|rni diverges as 1/ but its product with the three-particle vertex
of the resonances is constant in the limit   0.

let us consider now the ff of the z2 odd, local and even, semilocal elds,

concentrating our attention on the magnetization and disorder operators. the

magnetization (x) is local and has ff on all odd numbers of external particles. a

close solution of the recursive equations (4.2) is given by

f +

 (cid:19)n
2n+1 =(cid:18)2ki

(l)n(n+1)h1

2n+1

yi<j

f (ij) ,

(4.32)

where h1 = h0|(0)|ai.

the disorder operator (x) is semilocal and has ff on all even numbers of

external particles

f 

 (cid:19)n
2n =(cid:18)2ki

(l)n2

h0

2n

yi<j

f (ij) ,

(4.33)

where h0 = h0|(0)|0i. all the ff (4.32) and (4.33) possess the kinematic pole at
ij = i as well as at their periodic repeated positions (n)

ij = i + 2nt .

for the twopoint correlation functions of these elds we have

g(x) = h(r)(0)i ;
g+(x) = h(r)(0)i ,

(4.34)

(4.35)

as for the energy eld, at large distances these correlation functions have an

exponential decay, ruled by the mass gap m of the stable part of the spectrum

(4.36)

the only informations on the periodic structure of the theory may enter the normal-

ization in front of the exponentials. let us now analyse the shortdistance behaviour
of g(x). in absence of an exact resummation of the series (4.35), we have to rely
on other methods for computing the anomalous dimensions of the corresponding

elds. it is easy to see that, in contradistinction to the anomalous dimension  of

the energy operator which jumps discontinuosly from 1 to 0 by introducing a nite

period t , the anomalous dimension  (or equivalently ) depends continuously

on t . in fact, in the ultraviolet limit we can apply the thermodynamics approach

as in eq. (4.20) and write the following representation for the correlator

g = g+ + g  (cid:18) 1

mr(cid:19)p(l)

,

(4.37)

where the pressure of the onedimensional ctitious gas is given in eq. (4.21). since
in this case |f ()|2 is a regular and bounded function along the real axis for any
value of the module l, it follows that p(l) is a continous function of the module.

another way to reach the same conclusions is to analyse the exact expression for

the anomalous dimensions as obtained by the  sumrule

(l) = (l) =

f

(4.38)

the relative graph of this function is reported in figure 9. the curve starts from

 = 1

8 at l = 0 and goes then continously to zero at l = 1.

5 form factors for the elliptic sinhgordon model

let us now consider the quantum eld theory described by the elliptic smatrix

(2.6) and address in its full generality the problem of computing exactly its ff. we

will see that the ff equations admit in this case a large class of solutions which for
l  0 all collapse to the same solutions of the sinhgordon model. as a matter of
fact, due to the absence of constraints on the asymptotic behaviour of ff, the nal

set of solutions has indeed innite dimension.

26

we concentrate only on the case of ff of local operators. as usual, the rst step

consists in the evaluation of the twoparticle form factor. for any local operator,

this is a solution of the monodromy eqs. (3.4) with  = 0. using the exponential

representation (2.16) for the smatrix and the formula (3.10) we have

fmin() = n exp

the periodicity condition fmin( + t ) = fmin(). the previous expression for

fmin can be further elaborated in order to get a nal form, more suitable for the

determination of its analytic structure and for explicit calculations. as described in

details in appendix c, it can be rewritten, up to a constant, as an innite product

of trigonometric functions

fmin() =

the solution (5.2) is analytic in the plane except for an innite set of poles

(see appendix c for details)

poles :

n(k) =  ia + (2k  1)i + nt ;
n(k) =  ia + (2  k)2i + nt ;
n(k) = ia + (3  2k)i + nt ;
n(k) = ia + (k  1)2i + nt ;
n(k) = 2ki + nt ;
n(k) = (1  k)2i + nt ,

and it vanishes at the following locations

zeros :

n(k) =  ia + 2ki + nt ;
n(k) =  ia + (3  2k)i + nt ;
n(k) = ia + (1  k)2i + nt ;
n(k) = ia + (2k  1)i + nt ;
n(k) = (k  1)2i + nt ;
n(k) = (2  k)2i + nt .

(5.4)

(5.5)

for given k, poles and zeros have multiplicity (k  1) and they are drawn in figure
10. the minimal solution fmin does not have singularities in the physical sheet but
only single zeros in  = nt . the poles at  = ia + nt on the unphysical sheet of
fmin() may be regarded as bound state poles of the ff due to the resonances.

the solution (5.2) satises the functional relation

fmin( + i) fmin() =

.

(5.6)

sn(cid:0)2i k
t (cid:1)
t (cid:1)  sn (2ka)

sn(cid:0)2i k

this can be easily proven by studying the distribution of poles and zeros for the

product on the l.h.s., as shown in figure 11. when fmin() is multiplied by the

same function evaluated at the shifted point ( + i) a partial cancellation of poles

against zeros occurs, leaving only a distribution of simple poles and zeros (third line

of figure 11). this distribution indeed corresponds to the pole singularities and

28

zeros of the elliptic function on the r.h.s. of eq. (5.6). notice that we have used the
functional equation (5.6) as it stands in order to x a convenient normalization n
of fmin().

in order to simplify the following equations, it is convenient to introduce the

notation

u  i

k
t

 , uij  i

.

(5.7)

the general structure of nparticle form factors is given in eq. (3.5) in terms

of the minimal solution (5.2). since the theory has no bound states, the only

poles present are the kinematic poles associated to every threeparticle subchannels

(ij = i). this suggests to parameterise the functions kn entering the general

expression of the ff (3.5) as follows

kn(1,   , n) = hn qn(1,   , n) yi<j

1

cn uij

,

(5.8)

where hn are normalization constants. notice that in the above expression the

presence of the kinematic pole has been made explicit by the introduction of the

periodic elliptic functions cn uij . the choice of this parameterization is suggested

by the general requirement that the residue of fn at the kinematic pole has to be a
periodic function of the other (n  2) rapidity variables (see the general discussion
in sect. 3). therefore, the kinematic pole at ij = i appears toghether with an

innite sequence of poles located at ij = i + 2nt . even though the function cn u

is 2t periodic, the actual t periodicity of the residue of fn(1, ...n) at ij = i

will be restored by the consequent expressions of qn(1, ...n) obtained by using

this parameterization.

the function cn[u()] satises the identity

cn[u( + i)] cn[u()] = l  sn u cn u

dn u

.

(5.9)

the terms qn are symmetric, 2i periodic functions of the is, which have to

be determined by the recursive equations (3.11) satised by the ff. by using the

29

expression (2.7) for the smatrix and exploiting the functional relations (5.6) and

(5.9) together with eq. (a.10), we obtain the following recursive equations for the

functions qn

qn+2( + i, , 1,   , n) = dn( | 1,   , n) qn(1,   , n)

(5.10)

where

(5.13)

with the constants h0, h1 determined by the vacuum and the oneparticle ff of

let us discuss the general properties of the recursive equations (5.10). it is easy

to see that the solutions qn with n > 1 span in this case an innite dimensional
vector space. in fact, if qn(1, ..., n) is a nontrivial solution of the recursive eq.

(5.10), the general expression

qn(1, ..., n) = qn(1, ..., n) + an(1, ..., n) w (1, ..., n)

(5.14)

is still a solution if w (1, ..., n) belongs to the kernel of the recursive equation

wn( + i, , 3, ..., n) = 0 ,

(5.15)

i.e. wn(1, ..., n) =qi<j cn uij , and an(1,   , n) is a generic 2i periodic, sym-
metric function with possible pole singularities outside the physical strip and which
reduces to a constant in the limit l  0  the last requirement in order to reproduce

30

the standard result for the sinhgordon model. due to the periodic nature of the

theory under consideration, no extra constraints can be imposed on the function

an which then spans an innite space of solutions. moreover, as we will see from

explicit examples below, there exist in general several dierent nontrivial solutions
qn which however reduce to the same solution of the ff equations of the sinh
gordon model in the limit l  0. in other terms, given a solution qn of the ff
equations of the sinhgordon model, there are in general many dierent ways to
extend this function for l 6= 0 and obtain then distinct solutions of the ff equation
of the elliptic sinhgordon model.

let us concentrate now on the construction of particular solutions qn of the

recursive equations.

for n = 1, q1 is a constant, as required by relativistic invariance. by absorbing

this constant into the normalization h1, we can take q1 = 1.

for n = 2 a solution is given by

q2(1, 2) = cn u12 .

(5.16)

in fact, the twoparticle ff of any local operator cannot have a pole at 12 = i

so that q2(1, 2) must precisely cancel the pole introduced by the function cnu12
in the parameterization (5.8). for l  0 this solution reduces to the corresponding
one for the sinhgordon model [9, 10]. however, this is not the only acceptable

solution with this property. we can for instance divide the function (5.16) by dn u12

and obtain another admissible twoparticle ff, with no pole at 12 = i and which
reduces to the same function of the sinhgordon model in the limit l  0. this new
solution diers from the previous one by the distribution of zeros and poles on the

complex plane. in particular, it possesses poles at 12 = (2m + 1)i + (2n + 1)t
and zeros at 12 = 2im + (2n + 1)t , which are pushed to innity for l  0.

in the sinhgordon case this apriori innite set of solutions is severely restricted by the

constraints on the asymptotic behaviour of fn which eventually force the function an to be a

constant [10].

31

along these lines, it is easy to see that the most general solution to the recursive

equations for n = 2 falls into the class (5.14), i.e. it may be written as

q2(1, 2) = cn u12 q(12, l) ,

(5.17)

where q(12, l) is any 2i periodic, even function with no pole at 12 = i and such

that liml0 q(12, l) = constant. dierent solutions will have dierent distributions

of zeros and poles but, in the absence of extra requirements on the ff of this theory,

they are all acceptable, as far as they do not possess dangerous poles on the physical

strip.

let us now discuss the threeparticle ff. the function q3(1, 2, 3) must be a

solution of the equations (5.10) specialized to the case n = 3

q3( + i, , 3) =

2

1 + dn[2(u  u3)]

,

(5.18)

where we have used q1 = 1, absorbing the constant in h1. it is easy to nd two

dierent nontrivial solutions of this equation with no poles in the physical sheet

of each twoparticle subcluster. the rst one is given by

q(1)

3 (1, 2, 3) = (cid:20) cn(u12 + u13) cn u23

dn(u12 + u13) dn u23

+

cn(u23 + u21) cn u13
dn(u23 + u21) dn u13

+

+

the second solution is given by

cn(u13 + u23) cn u12

dn(u13 + u23) dn u12(cid:21) .

q(2)

3 (1, 2, 3) =(cid:20) cn2 u12

dn2 u12

+

cn2 u13
dn2 u13

+

cn2 u23

dn2 u23(cid:21) .

(5.19)

(5.20)

both expressions for t   fall into the general q3 solution for the sinhgordon
model which is given by [10].

qsh

3 (1, 2, 3) = a1(cosh 12 + cosh 13 + cosh 23) + a2 ,

(5.21)

with a2  a1 = 1. we notice that both the solutions are periodic in each variable,
with period 2t , even if they satisfy the condition for the residue at the kinematic

32

pole to be t periodic, as it follows from the recursive equation (3.11). however, in

general nothing prevents one from nding also t periodic solutions.

as in the n = 2 case we can generate a pletora of solutions by multiplying the

solutions (5.19) and (5.20) by any function q(1, 2, 3, l) which is 2i periodic,

symmetric, with q( + i, , 3, l) = constant and such that it reduces to a constant
in the l  0 limit. such a function may be written, for instance, in terms of
arbitrary powers of the expression q0(1, 2, 3) = dn u12 dn u13 dn u23.

as a nal example, we provide explicit solutions of the recursive equations (5.10)

for n = 4. in this case, we need to nd q4 satisfying

q4( + i, , 3, 4) = 4i

sn[2(u  u3)] + sn[2(u  u4)]

[1 + dn[2(u  u3)]] [1 + dn[2(u  u4)]]  q2(3, 4) .

(5.22)

using some of the identities listed in appendix a and inserting the explicit expres-

sion for q2 as given in eq. (5.16), the previous equation can be rewritten as

q4( + i, , 3, 4) = 8i

if we now dene the functions

sn(2u  u3  u4) cn2(u3  u4) dn(u3  u4)

[dn(2u  u3  u4) + dn(u3  u4)]2

it is easy to determine various solutions with no poles on the physical strip. here

we list two of them.

(5.29)

the sinhgordon ff relative to this solution goes asymptotically to zero in each

variable i.

starting from a dierent expression for q2, one can easily generate other solu-

tions for the fourparticle form factors which however reduce either to (5.27) or
(5.29) in the limit l  0.

concerning the computation of higher ff, it can be performed along the same

lines of the previous examples. as shown by the rst few cases, the periodic nature

of the theory will manifest itself in the appearance of innite sets of solutions

which all collapse to the standard solutions for the sinhgordon model in the
l  0 limit. as far as the modulus l is kept away from zero, dierent solutions
for the nparticle form factors are characterized by a dierent analytic structure.

34

it would be interesting to understand how to discriminate among dierent ff on

the basis of a detailed investigation of the zeros and poles distributions of matrix

elements of the various operators present in the theory. moreover, it would be

highly desirable to have a concise and closed formula at least for a sequence of form

factors fn(1, ..., n) as in the sinhgordon model [10], but the determination of

this formula has presently eluded our attempts.

finally, let us briey discuss some aspects of the esg model in its ultraviolet

regime. among the solutions of the ff equation we expect to nd those ones which

identify with the matrix elements of the trace (x) of the stressenergy tensor. this

is a z2 even eld, with nonvanishing ff for all 2n numbers of external particles.

the ff of the eld (x) can be used to compute the central charge of the model

in its ultraviolet limit by means of the c-theorem sum rule

c(t ) = z 

0

d c1() ,

(5.30)

where c1() is given by

c1() =

m sinh i) (xi

(2)2n

m cosh i  ) .

| f 

2n(1, . . . , 2n) |2

(5.31)

assuming the uniform convergence of this series (so that we can interchange the

sum on the index n with the integral in (5.30)), it is immediate to conclude that

the central charge of the model can take any value in the interval (0, 1) depending
in fact, for t   we recover the sum rule
on the period t of the smatrix.
series of the sinhgordon model, i.e. c() = 1. viceversa for t  0 each term
of the series goes to zero and therefore c(0) = 0. the series (5.31) is a continous

and monotonic decreasing function of t so that by varying this parameter we can

reach any value in the interval (0, 1). therefore, in the ultraviolet limit we have

generically a nonunitary irrational conformal field theory. as a consequence, it

seems reasonable that the existence of an innite dimensional space of solutions for

35

the ff of the esg theory can be traced back to the nonunitary irrational nature of

the cft in the uv region and to its relative innite number of primary operators.

6 conclusions

in this paper we have analysed certain massive integrable z2 invariant quantum

eld theories with an innite tower of resonance states. these states are associated

to an unlimited sequence of poles on the unphysical sheet of the smatrix for a

fundamental particle a and may be regarded as unstable bound states thereof. as

a function of the energy, the phaseshift of the scattering amplitude presents sharp

jumps in correspondence to the masses of the resonances. the smatrix of these

theories has a real periodic behaviour in the variable .

the form factors of such theories may be computed in principle along the same

lines of other integrable relativistic models, i.e. by solving the monodromy and

recursive equations coming from the residue condition on the kinematical poles.

however, new features have emerged from the periodic nature of the smatrix: on

the one hand, there is a very severe constraint on the residues of the form factors

fn(1, ...n) at their kinematical poles ij = i, which have to be periodic expres-

sions of the remaining rapidity variables k. conversely, an innite proliferation of

solutions of the ff equations occurs, due to the lack of very stringent conditions

on their analytic structure or to the impossibility of enforcing a given asymptotic

behaviour in each rapidity variable i.

while it is an interesting open problem to develop further theoretical criteria

to identify the operators associated to these solutions, nevertheless the presence of

an innite number of them seems compatible with an other aspect of these models

related to their behavior in the ultraviolet regime.

in fact, the conformal field

theories which are approached in the ultraviolet limit are generally nonunitary

and irrational, therefore with an innite number of primary elds. the value of

36

the central charge may be xed by varying the spectrum of the resonances, i.e. by

changing the period t of the smatrix.

since these qft with resonance states may be thought of as theories with

additional mass scales compared to those given by the spectrum of stable particles,

it is an interesting general problem to determine how these extra mass scales aect

the dierent regimes of the theory. from our analysis it has emerged that the large

distance behaviour of the model is hardly aected by them, being essentially ruled

by the mass gaps of the stable part of the spectrum. on the contrary, the ultraviolet

properties of the theory are deeply inuenced by the innite tower of unstable states

which, in the ultraviolet regime, tend to smooth the shortdistance divergencies

and to decrease their related quantities. as a consequence, ultraviolet singularities

are in general less severe, and the central charge of the underlying conformal field

theory takes lower (in general irrational) values than in the absence of the resonance

states. it would be interesting to further investigate the ultraviolet properties of

these theories with resonances by means of the thermodynamics bethe ansatz.

more generally, it would be highly desirable to understand whether these theories

allow for a lagrangian description, and to nd possible applications to statistical

mechanics systems. moreover, the possibility to dene other periodic models cer-

tainly deserves more investigation as well as the possible computation of ff for the

z4model of ref. [6].

and sn(x ) denotes the derivative of the function sn(x ). the coecients an for n 6= 0

let us consider the complex loop integral

(b.5)

on a closed path c which runs along the boundary of half the fundamental domain,
i.e.  t
2 , 0 < imt < i. due to the real periodicity of the function
e(t) on the complex tplane, it is easy to see that the contributions from the

2 < ret < t

vertical lines of the path cancel each others, while the integral on the imt = i

line can be rewritten as an integral on the real axis by exploiting the property
e(t + i) = e(t). therefore, for the coecients an we have

2

n an (cid:16)1 + e2n 

t (cid:17) = 

2k

t ic

dt e 2i

t nt e(t)

(b.6)

inside the domain of integration the function e(t) has two simple poles at t =
ia, i(1  a). computing the corresponding residues we obtain

n an =

cosh(cid:16) n2

t (1  2a)(cid:17)
cosh(cid:0) n2
t (cid:1)

,

n 6= 0

(b.7)

inserting this result in eq. (b.1) and exploiting the parity properties of the expression
under n  n, we can write
xn=1

s(, a) =  exp
2i

(cid:19) + a0
 ,

sin(cid:18) 2n

where a0 is the contribution of the zeromode, which is given by

(b.9)

the zero mode a0 ensures in particular that in the limit a  0 we have s(, a)  1.
now, using the identity (a.15) to rewrite the zero mode as a series expansion, we

nally obtain the expression

s() =  exp

in order to obtain the second expression (2.16) for the smatrix, it is initially

convenient to split the zeromode contribution into two series on the odd and even

numbers, i.e.

and adding the term in the exponential of this expression to the zero mode, as a

result we have that the series of the zero mode on the odd numbers changes its sign

in front so that we end up with the expression

appendix c

in this appendix we report the detailed calculation for the esg minimal form

factor as given in eq. (5.2). let us consider the minimal solution to the monodromy

equations for the esg model as given in eq. (5.1). by exploiting the arbitrariness

t

of an overall constant in front of fmin we can replace 2 sin2(cid:16)n 
(cid:17) in eq. (5.1)
with cos(cid:16) 2n
(cid:17) and take as starting point the following expression
(cid:19)
cos(cid:18)2n
 .

fmin() = exp

now, splitting the ksum into a sum on even and odd integers and using the general

by plugging the expression (c.6) of cn into eq.(c.1) and performing explicitly the

sum on n by means of the identity (a.17), we arrive to the nal expression reported

in the text (eq. (5.2))

where

fmin() =



yk=2

(w (, k))k1 ,

w (, k) = (cid:16)1  2q6 cos(cid:16)2

it is now easy to determine the location of zeros and poles of this function. they
are simply given by the solutions of the generic equation 1  2q cos x + q2 = 0, for
the numerator and denominator factors, respectively. rewriting this equation as

(cid:0)1  qeix(cid:1)(cid:0)1  qeix(cid:1) = 0 ,

the general solution has the form

x =  i ln q + 2n

, n  z .

(c.9)

(c.10)

applying this result to the factors in eq. (c.8) and taking in account the explicit

expressions for the qis, we obtain the sets of poles and zeros (5.4), (5.5) reported

in the text.
