abstract

a new family of s-matrix theories with resonance poles is constructed and con-
jectured to correspond to the homogeneous sine-gordon theories associated with
simply laced compact lie groups, where some of the resonance poles can be traced
to the presence of unstable particles in the spectrum. these theories are unitary in
the usual ss = 1 sense, they are not parity invariant, and they exhibit continuous
coupling constants that determine both the mass spectrum of stable particles and
the masses and the position of the resonance poles.

despite the fact that almost all known particles are unstable [1], their quantum de-
scription is still a controversial topic, mainly in the relativistic domain [2]. the phe-
nomenological relevance of this controversy is exemplied by the analysis of the lep and
slc data of electron-positron collisions to study the (unstable) z0 boson, which moti-
vated a debate about the proper denition of the mass of the z0 leading to theoretical
uncertainties even larger than the experimental error [3]. similarly, the more convenient
phenomenological description of hadron resonances has also been recently a matter of
discussion [4]. in realistic quantum eld theories, questions like this can generally only
be addressed in perturbation theory or by means of other approximate methods, and so
it would be extremely useful to have simple solvable models whose spectrum contains
unstable particles.

the construction of solvable models that capture realistic properties of quantum parti-
cles is one of the classical motivations for the study of two-dimensional integrable quantum
eld theories. however, the vast majority of the integrable models considered so far lack
the feature of including unstable particles. exceptions are provided by the integrable
perturbation of the so(3)k wess-zumino-witten model discussed by brazhnikov [5] and,
mainly, by the unitary quantum eld theories associated with the non-abelian ane toda
equations recently constructed by the authors in collaboration with gallas and hollowood
in [6]; namely, the homogeneous and symmetric space sine-gordon theories 1. the semi-
classical spectrum of these models consists of a nite number of solitonic particles attached
to the positive roots of a lie algebra, but only those associated with the simple roots turn
out to be stable. the aim of this paper is to propose an exact solution for the homoge-
neous sine-gordon theories (hsg) corresponding to simply laced lie groups.

the exact solution of a two-dimensional relativistic integrable quantum eld theory is
encoded into its two-particle scattering amplitudes. indeed, the existence of an innite
number of higher-spin conserved charges makes the s-matrix factorise into products of
two-particle amplitudes. then, the property of factorisation itself and the usual axioms of
s-matrix theory constrain the allowed form of the s-matrix amplitudes to such an extent
that it becomes possible to conjecture their form [8]. although it is very dicult to
distinguish physically between an unstable particle of long lifetime and a stable particle,
axiomatic s-matrix theory makes a big distinction between them. the reason is that it
is based on asymptotic states that exist for arbitrarily long time and, hence, they can
only contain stable particles.
in contrast, the basic property of a long-lived unstable
particle, and the one by means of which it is usually observed, it that it correspond to a
resonance in interactions among the stable particles. therefore, if two stable particles
scatter at centre-of-mass energy s close to the mass of an unstable state with appropriate
quantum numbers, the corresponding s-matrix amplitude is expected to exhibit a complex
pole at sr = (m  i/2)2 in the second riemann sheet, i.e., o but nearby the real axis
in the complex s-plane [9]. the position of the pole is given by the mass, m, and decay
width, , of the resonance, whose inverse is the lifetime of the unstable particle:  = h/.
if the lifetime is long or, equivalently, if   m, the form of the pole is given by the
1using the construction of ref. [6], the model of brazhnikov can be described as a symmetric space
sine-gordon (sssg) theory associated with the compact type-i symmetric space su (3)/so(3), and it is
expected that many other sssg theories exhibit similar properties [7].

in a generic theory, unstable particles can also induce other singularities like complex
thresholds and cuts. the simplest would correspond to the production of the unstable
particle together with one stable particle. however, since the unstable particle decays,
this kind of process would lead to particle production and, hence, it has to be absent if
the theory is integrable. therefore, we will assume that resonance poles are the only trace
of unstable particles in an integrable quantum eld theory.

so far, only a few examples of factorised s-matrix theories with resonance poles have
been considered in the literature. the most important are the staircase models, in-
troduced originally by al. zamolodchikov [10] and generalized by martins, dorey and
ravanini [11], where the presence of resonances induces a remarkable pattern of roaming
renormalization group trajectories. in addition, a. zamolodchikov and, very recently,
mussardo and penati have also proposed interesting factorised s-matrix theories with an
innite number of resonance poles [12]. however, although they are completely consistent
from the scattering theory point of view, it is not known whether any of these models
allows for a lagrangian description, which makes dicult the identication of resonances
with unstable particles.

in contrast, the homogeneous sine-gordon theories always have a unitary lagrangian
description. there is a dierent hsg theory for each simple compact lie group g that
corresponds to a unitary integrable perturbation of the conformal eld theory (cft)
associated with the coset gk/u(1)rg, where rg is the rank of g, or, equivalently, of the
theory of level-k g-parafermions [13]. it is given by the action

shsg[h, a] =

1

2(cid:26)swzw[h, a]  z d2x v (h)(cid:27) ,

(2)

where h is a bosonic eld that takes values in g, and a are (non-dynamical) abelian gauge
connections taking values in a cartan subalgebra of g, the lie algebra of g. swzw[h, a]
is the gauged wess-zumino-witten action corresponding to gk/u(1)rg, and 2 = 1/k +
o(1/k2) is the coupling constant. actually, if the plank constant is explicitly shown, the
last identity becomes h2 = 1/k +o(1/k2), which exhibits that, just as in the sine-gordon
theory, the semi-classical limit is the same as the weak-coupling limit, and that both are
recovered when k  . in (2), the potential is v (h) = m2h+, h hi/, where h , i
is the killing form on g, m2 is the only dimensionful constant of the theory, and + and
 are two arbitrary semisimple elements of the cartan subalgebra. assuming that the
level k is larger than the dual coxeter number of g, it was shown in [13] that the hsg
theories are quantum integrable for any choice of the group g and for any value of + and
 which, therefore, play the role of coupling constants. shsg is invariant with respect
to the abelian gauge transformations h(x, t) 7 e  h e   () and a 7 a  , where
 = (x, t) takes values in the cartan subalgebra and x = t x are light-cone variables.
the precise form of these gauge transformations is specied by  , which is an arbitrary
element of the orthogonal group o(rg) chosen such that  (u) 6= h
0uh0 for any u in the
cartan subalgebra, where h0 is the minimum of the potential. without loss of generality,
we will take + and  inside the fundamental weyl chamber of the cartan subalgebra,

2

such that h0 = i up to gauge transformations. moreover, since the spectrum of the hsg
theories is independent of  , we will only consider the particular choice  = i.
group of transformations h 7 e  he h

the action shsg also exhibits an abelian u(1)rg global symmetry with respect to the
0h0, where  is any constant element in the cartan
subalgebra. this implies the existence of a conserved vector noether charge. another
important property of the hsg theories is that they are not parity invariant for generic
values of the coupling constants + and . namely, taking into account our choice for
 , they are not parity invariant unless + is parallel to , a particular case that will not
be considered here. further information about these theories can be found in the original
papers [6, 13, 14].

the classical integrability of the hsg theories is ensured by the existence of rank of
g conserved quantities for each non-vanishing integer scale dimension 1,2, . . .. their
quantum integrability was established in [13] by explicitly checking that, after an appro-
priate renormalization, all the conserved quantities of spin 1 and 2 remain conserved
in the quantum theory. all this implies that the hsg theories should admit a factorised
s-matrix description, and our goal is to construct it starting from the semi-classical spec-
trum of the hsg theory associated with a simply laced lie group g, which is of solitonic
nature. let us introduce a chevalley basis for the complexication of g, the lie algebra of
g, which consists in cartan generators ~~h together with step operators e~ for each root
~, such that ~ and ~ live in a rg-dimensional vector space provided with an inner product
normalized such that long roots have square length 2 (if g is simply laced all roots are
long). then,  = i~  ~h, and the condition that + and  are in the fundamental
weyl chamber translates into ~  ~ > 0 for any positive root ~ of g. we will also assume
that the theory is not parity invariant, which means that we will exclude the case when
~+ = ~ for any real number . in [14], it was shown that the equations-of-motion of the
hsg theories admit time-dependent soliton solutions. in their rest frame, these solitons
provide explicit periodic time-dependent periodic solutions and, hence, the semi-classical
spectrum can be obtained by applying the bohr-sommerfeld quantization rule. for a
simply laced group g, the resulting spectrum consists of towers of k  1 soliton particles
for each positive root ~ with masses

m~[n] =

r, where 

is the mass of the fundamental particle of the theory associated with ~. as a consequence
of the u(1)rg global symmetry of the theory, these particles carry a conserved vector
noether charge given by ~q~(n) = n~ modulo k
r is the co-root lattice of g,
which coincides with the root lattice if g is simply laced. moreover, for a given ~, the
particle labelled by k  n is identied with the anti-particle of the particle labelled by n.
for a xed root ~, the spectrum is identical to that one of the minimal s-matrix theory
associated with the lie algebra ak1 or, equivalently, to the spectrum of the complex sine-
gordon theory [15], which is the hsg theory associated with g = su(2). the lightest
states associated with a given root ~ correspond to n = 1 and n = k  1 and have mass
m~[1] = m~ + o(1/k2) and noether charge ~q~[1] =  ~q~[k  1] = ~. these quantum
numbers are those of the fundamental particles of the hsg theory associated with ~

3

and, hence, these states are identied with the fundamental particles and anti-particles
in the semi-classical k   limit. moreover, if n = a + b modulo k, one can check that
m~[n] < m~[a] + m~[b] and ~q~[n] = ~q~[a] + ~q~[b], which leads to the interpretation of
the state (~, n) as a bound state of (~, a) and (~, b), and is the basis of the bootstrap
equations that will be satised by our factorised s-matrices. all these identications can
be made because the solitons of the hsg theories do not carry topological charges.

~q~[n] =

rgxi=1

(5)

which suggests that the soliton particle (~, n) might be unstable and decay into particles
associated with the simple roots. actually, it can be easily checked that

m~+~ = m~ e (~  ~+~) + m~ e (~  ~+~)

(6)

where ~, ~, and ~ + ~ are three roots of g, and ~ = 1
. eq. (6) means that the
decay of the soliton particle (~ + ~, n) into (~, n) and (~, n) is kinematically allowed in
two dierent ways where the outgoing particles would be produced at relative rapidity
~  ~ = (~  ~). these two kinematical possibilities for the decay of the particle
(~ + ~, n) are related by means of a parity transformation; however, recall that the theory
is not parity invariant in the generic case we are considering.

to check that this decay is not in contradiction with classical integrability we have
calculated the innite number of conserved quantities carried by the soliton particle (~, n).
this calculation can be done by using the explicit vertex operator construction of these
soliton solutions presented in [14] together with the expression for the conserved quantities
in terms of tau-functions given in [16], and will be presented elsewhere. the result is that
the rg conserved quantities of spin s carried by the soliton (~, n) moving with rapidity 
are given by the components of

~q(s)

~ [n]() = e s(+~) sin(cid:16)s

they satisfy the following identity

[n]() = ~q(s)

[n](  ~ + ~+~) ,

(7)

(8)

which, together with (5), shows that only one of the two kinematically allowed possibilities
for the decay is compatible with classical integrability; i.e., when the products move with
relative rapidity

~  ~ = ~  ~ = ~,~ .

(9)

in order to make sure that the decay actually happens in the quantum theory, we
will calculate the decay amplitude and decay width of the soliton particle (~ + ~, 1),
which is identied with a fundamental particle in the semi-classical or weak-coupling
k  1/2   limit. then, the decay amplitude can be calculated in perturbation
theory by using the lagrangian description of the hsg theories given by the action (2).

the tree-level contribution can be easily obtained by means of the following standard
procedure. first, solve the constraints given by the equations of motion of the (non-
dynamical) abelian gauge connections a. second, write the wzw eld in terms of
complex elds associated with the fundamental particles,

which exhibits the two kinematical possibilities for the decay indicated by eq. (6) with
~  ~ = ~,~. however, since pq = m~m~ sinh(~  ~), the nal expression for
the decay amplitude simplies to

(18)

which is consistent with eq. (9) and shows than only the decay that is compatible with
classical integrability actually happens in the quantum theory, i.e., ~  ~ = ~,~. this
is also an indication that the decay is not parity symmetric. for instance, if ~ > ~
particle ~ is produced precisely on the right-hand-side of particle ~, and the other way
round if ~ < ~. from (18), it is straightforward to calculate the decay width of the
fundamental particle corresponding to ~ + ~ that will be needed in the following. the
result is

(19)

where we have used that, in the chevalley basis, the structure constants n~,~ of a simply
laced lie algebra equal 1.
eqs. (12)(14) also provide the two-particle scattering amplitudes in the tree-level
approximation. since the hsg theories are not parity invariant, these amplitudes will be
of the form [17]

ha~(p), a~(q) | s | a~(p), a~(q)i = 4(2)2 (

~  ~)(

~  ~) s ~ ~(~  ~) ,

(20)

with

s ~ ~(~  ~) = (~  ~) s~,~() + (~  ~) s~,~() ,

(21)
where  = |~  ~| and (x) is the usual heaviside function: (x) = 0 if x < 0 and = 1
if x > 0. s~,~() and s~,~() are the scattering amplitudes corresponding to the processes
where particle ~ initially is on the left-hand-side and on the right-hand-side of particle ~,
respectively, which are related by means of a parity transformation. the analyticity axiom
of s-matrix theory postulates that both functions can be continued to complex values of
 and, since the theory is integrable, that the resulting functions will be meromorphic.
moreover, these meromorphic functions have to be related by the hermitian analyticity
condition [17]

for our purposes, we will only need the scattering amplitudes among the fundamental
particles associated with the simple roots:

s~i,~j () =

1  i 2 coth 1
1 + i 22 coth 1

2 (  ji) + o(4)
2 + o(4)

if ~i + ~j is a root,

if ~i = ~j,

otherwise,

(23)




where ij = ~i  ~i = ji. notice that s~i,~j () satises eq. (22). moreover, if ~i + ~j
is a root, it exhibits a pole at  = ji.
it is just the resonance pole corresponding to
the unstable fundamental particle associated with the root ~i + ~j, and its position is in
precise agreement with eq. (9).

our purpose is to construct factorised s-matrix theories compatible with the properties
of the hsg theories. our main assumption will be that the exact spectrum of stable
particles coincides with the semi-classical spectrum of soliton particles associated with the
simple roots of the algebra. therefore, according to (3), there will be k  1 particles for
each simple root ~i with masses mi[n] = m~i[n], where n = 1, . . . , k 1 and i = 1, . . . , rg.
recall that particle (~i, n) carries a conserved vector noether charge together with an
innite number of higher spin conserved charges which are proportional to ~i. this
implies that particles associated with dierent simple roots belong to dierent multiplets
for any value of the coupling constants ~. moreover, the existence of conserved charges
with even scale dimension allows one to distinguish between particles and anti-particles.
then, even though mi[n] = mi[k n], particle (~i, n) and its anti-particle (~i, k n) have
to be also in dierent multiplets. consequently, scattering has to be purely elastic and
our factorised s-matrix theory will be diagonal.

since the spectrum for a xed root ~i is identical to the spectrum of the minimal s-
matrix theory associated with the lie algebra ak1, and taking into account (23), we will
assume that the scattering among particles corresponding to the same root is described
by the minimal ak1 s-matrix amplitudes. namely, the scattering amplitude between
particles (~i, m) and (~i, n) will be given by [18, 19]

sm~i,n~i() = sn~i,m~i() = sak1

(25)

has been borrowed from [19]. when m = n = 1, it is straightforward to check that (24)
agrees with (23) in the k  1/2   limit.
the other particles in the semi-classical spectrum are assumed to be unstable. there-
fore, in the limit when their lifetime is long, they should correspond to resonances poles.
in the k   limit, the position of the pole is given by eq. (9). consequently, if ~i + ~j
is a root of g we will assume that the corresponding unstable particle (~i + ~j, 1) shows
up as a complex simple (resonance) pole in s~i,~j () or s~j,~i() depending on whether
ji = ~j ,~i is positive or negative, respectively. let r =   i be the position of the
pole. in the complex s-plane, it corresponds to
~i + m2

~j + 2 m~i m~j cosh(  i) ,

in the k  1/2   limit, this pole can be safely associated with a long lived unstable
particle of mass m~i+~j if the following conditions are satised:

~i+~j = m2

m 2  m2
~j + 2 m~i m~j cosh ij ,
m   m~i+~j ~i,~j = 2 m~i m~j sinh|ij| 2 ,

~i + m2

(30)

together with   m, where we have used eqs. (6) and (19). the simplest solution is to
take  = |ij| and  = /k  2  0, i.e., to x the position of the resonance pole at
r = |ij|  i/k.
taking into account this together with eqs. (22) and (23), our proposal for the scat-
tering amplitude between the particles (~i, 1) and (~j, 1) is

s~i,~j () = i,j (1)ji

6= s~j ,~i() ,

if ~i + ~j is a root of g, and s~i,~j = 1 otherwise. in (31), i,j = 1

(32)

notice that s~i,~j () has a simple pole at  = ji i/k; however, if it is a resonance pole,
it has to be nearby the physical real positive -axis, which requires that ji > 0. only
in this case the pole can be understood as the trace of an unstable particle. in contrast,
also if ji = ij > 0, the pole of s~j,~i() at  = ij  i/k is just a shadow pole whose
existence is required by the hermitian analyticity condition. the s-matrix amplitudes
among non-fundamental particles are obtained by means of the bootstrap principle. in
this case, the only possible fusions are (~i, a) + (~i, b)  (~i, c) with c = a + b modulo k,
i.e., those of the minimal ak1 s-matrix theory, which occur at the rapidity values  = iuab:

if ~i + ~j is a root, and = 1 otherwise. it is easy to check that all the simple poles of
sm~i,n~j () are located at  = ji  i with 0 <  < , as required by the property of
causality.
since our s-matrix theory is diagonal, it trivially satises the yang-baxter equation.
however, in order to show that eqs. (24) and (34) dene a consistent theory, it is necessary
to check whether they satisfy the following properties [8]:

8

(i) analyticity. all the two-particle amplitudes sa,b() are meromorphic functions of .
moreover, since the theory is not parity invariant, the two amplitudes sa,b() and
sb,a() are related by means of the hermitian analyticity condition

sa,b() = hsb,a()i

,

(35)

which is the proper formulation of analyticity in the framework of standard s-matrix
theory (see [17] and the references therein).

(ii) unitarity. the amplitudes given by eqs. (24) and (34) satisfy

sa,b() sb,a() = 1 .

(36)

this is the condition that usually plays the role of unitarity in the context of the
quantum group approach to two-dimensional factorised s-matrix theories, but it
is well known that it is not equivalent to physical unitarity (ss = 1) unless the
s-matrix amplitudes exhibit additional symmetries, like parity or time-reversal in-
variance [20]. nevertheless, it was shown in [17] that (36) is equivalent to physical
unitarity if the s-matrix amplitudes exhibit hermitian analyticity, which means
that our amplitudes also satisfy

sa,b() [sa,b()] = 1 ,

(37)

for real values of . this supports the claim that the hsg theories are unitary
integrable quantum eld theories.

(iii) crossing symmetry. our amplitudes satisfy

sa,b(i  ) = sb,a() ,

(38)

where the charge conjugation operator maps a = (~i, n) into a = (~i, k  n).
eqs. (36) and (38) imply that our two-particle s-matrix amplitudes are 2i-periodic
functions, despite not being real analytic.

(iv) bootstrap equations. since the only possible fusions are (~j, a) + (~j, b)  (~j, c)
with c = a + b modulo k, which occur at the rapidity values  = iuab given by
eq. (33), the bootstrap equations read

this agrees with the perturbative result given by eq. (23) up to the presence of the
-independent phase factor i,j that is essential to satisfy both the crossing symmetry
relation given by (38) and the bootstrap equations (39). to spell this out, it is enough to

consider bsm~i,n~j = mn
i,j sm~i,n~j and check that bsm~i,n~j (i  ) = (1)nbsn~j,(km)~i(),
which shows that i,jj,i = 1 and (i,j)k = 1 are needed in order to satisfy the crossing
symmetry relation. the bootstrap equations lead to the same requirements.
it is worth pointing out that the phase factors i,j can alternatively be taken to be
-dependent if we are ready to relax the requirement of analyticity. for instance, if
(re()ai,j ) in (34), our s-matrix amplitudes still satisfy unitar-
i,j  i,j
ity, crossing symmetry and the bootstrap equations provided that (i,j)k = (i,j)k = 1,
i,jj,i = 1, and ai,j = aj,i. moreover, they also satisfy the hermitian analyticity con-
dition (35), even though the amplitudes are not meromorphic functions of  any more.
a physical motivation for a choice like this can be found in [21] where non-analyticity is
related to generalized statistics and is used to make the physical scattering amplitudes
have a trivial asymptotic behaviour sab()  1 when   . actually, in our case it is
reasonable to demand that sm~i,n~j becomes trivial also when |i,j|  , i.e., in the limit
when the mass m~i+~j of the unstable particle becomes innite and, hence, it is expected
to decouple. both asymptotic conditions can be implemented by taking i,j = 1
i,j = ei/k
and ai,j = 2j,i for some real number .
along the paper, we have restricted ourselves to the case when parity is broken in the
classical theory, which means that ~+ and ~ are not allowed to be parallel. however,
eq. (34) makes perfect sense also in this case. if ~+ = ~ for some real number  then
i,j = 0 for any i, j and, for i 6= j, all the poles of sm~i,n~j () are located along the negative
part of the imaginary -axis, which means that they can be associated with virtual states
instead of unstable particles. nevertheless, even in this case the factorised s-matrix theory
fails to be parity invariant because i,j 6= j,i. actually, these -independent phase factors
are reminiscent of the two-particle scattering amplitudes of the federbush model, which
is the simplest non-parity invariant integrable theory [22].

in conclusion, eqs. (24) and (34) dene consistent s-matrix theories compatible with
the semi-classical spectrum of the simply laced hsg theories. this supports the conjecture
that they actually provide the exact solution of the hsg theories corresponding to simply
laced compact simple lie groups. since the hsg theory associated with a lie group
g is an integrable perturbation of the theory of level-k g-parafermions, our next task
is to probe the uv limit of the proposed s-matrix theories using the thermodynamic
bethe ansatz. in particular, this analysis will give the value of the central charge of the
underlying uv conformal eld theories which, in our case, should be (k 1) hgrg/(k + hg),
where rg and hg are the rank and coxeter number of g, respectively. an important novel
feature of this analysis, which is already in progress [23], is the loss of parity invariance.
moreover, the existence of dierent mass scales depending on the values of the coupling
constants ~+ and ~ is expected to induce a staircase-like behaviour of the eective
central charge. this should be a consequence of the change in the number of light degrees
of freedom associated with the decoupling of the heavy particles, both stable and unstable.
it is worth noticing that in the case of the original staircase models [10, 11] such a direct
physical interpretation is not possible due to the lack of a lagrangian description.
