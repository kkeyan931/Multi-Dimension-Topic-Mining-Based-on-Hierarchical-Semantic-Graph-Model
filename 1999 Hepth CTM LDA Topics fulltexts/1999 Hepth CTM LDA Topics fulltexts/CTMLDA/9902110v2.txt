we show that the n = 0 theories on the self-dual d3-branes of type 0 string theory are

in the class of the previously considered tadpole-free orbifolds of n = 4 theory (although

they have so(6) global symmetry) and hence have vanishing beta function in the planar

limit to all orders in t hooft coupling. also, all planar amplitudes in this theory are equal

to those of n = 4 theory, up to a rescaling of the coupling.

vanishing of the planar beta function. recently the non-supersymmetric gauge theo-

ries were studied in the framework of string theory/gauge theory correspondence [1][2][3][4].

the case [5] of n = 4 super-yang-mills theory can be modied in several ways leading

to the theories with lower supersymmetry. one possibility is to restrict the set of elds

of n = 4 theory according to the following principle: take a discrete subgroup  of the

r-symmetry group so(6) and let it act on the color indices in some representation r:
g 7 g  u (dimr). let  denote a eld of the n = 4 theory. the index  belongs
to the representation of the r-symmetry group, and both color and lorentz indices are

omited. impose the invariance condition:

 = g

 (cid:2) 1

g g(cid:3)

(1)

for any g  . it is known [6][7] that if the representation r is such that for any group

element g 6= 1

trrg = 0

(2)

then the planar graphs in the resulting theory are equal to those of the parent n = 4

theory up to a rescaling of coupling. all these theories occur in the studies of the type
iib theory compactied on ir1,3  ir6/ [8] and they were suggested as examples of large

n conformal theories dual to certain string theory backgrounds [9]. they are known to

be one-loop nite for all  [10] while for higher loops they are known to have vanishing

gauge beta functions in the planar limit (see [10] for two loops in the n = 1 case, [6][7]

for general case).

i. klebanov and a. tseytlin [2][3] suggested to study the d-branes in the type 0b

theory [11]. this theory has in the low-energy spectrum no fermions, the same ns bosons

as type iib theory but the doubled set of rr bosons. the doubled set of rr elds leads

to the doubled set of d-branes. in particular, there are two types of d3-branes: electric

and magnetic ones. it turns out that the low-energy theory on the stack of n d3-branes

is a truncated version of the n = 4 theory. in the case of pure electric or pure magnetic

d3-branes one has a theory of u (n ) gluons coupled to six adjoint scalars while in the case

of (1, 1) branes one has u (n ) u (n ) gauge group, six adjoint scalars for each gauge factor
and two sets of bi-fundamental fermions (n, n ) and ( n, n ). those fermions correspond
to the open strings connecting electric and magnetic branes [12][2]. in the paper [3] the

two-loop niteness of this self-dual theory was proven in the leading-n approximation

while [13] studied further aspects of self-dual threebranes.

the purpose of our paper is to point out that this theory has in fact vanishing planar

beta function to all orders in t hooft coupling, just like any other orbifold theory studied

in [9][10][6][7].

the point is that both the electric and self-dual theories are also orbifolds of n = 4

theory. the slightly subtle point is that the r-symmetry group of n = 4 theory is the

spin cover of so(6), i.e. su (4). this group has a center z  zz4. the group  = zz2  z

can also be used for orbifolding just like any other subgroup of su (4).

by inserting projectors on the -invariant elds (1) into the t hooft diagrams one

immediately sees that if the representation of  in the gauge group obeys (2) then the

planar gauge coupling beta function vanishes.

for the self-dual theory one starts with u (2n ) n = 4 theory and represents  = {1, }

in the u (2n ) as follows:

 = (cid:18) 1

0 1(cid:19)

0

where the blocks are n  n . clearly this representation obeys (2).

for the purely electric theory one starts with u (n ) n = 4 gauge theory and takes

the trivial representation of  which does not obey (2). hence the theory has non-trivial

beta function even in the large n limit.

another so(6) invariant theory. another n = 0 theory with so(6) global symmetry

is the one corresponding to  = zz4. we would start with u (4n ) n = 4 gauge theory and

represent  = {1, , 2, 3} as g = diag(cid:0)1, g, g2, g3(cid:1)  1n n . in this case the orbifold
group acts on the scalars by changing the sign of all six of them. the eld content is1:
gauge group u (n )4, two sextets of bi-fundamental scalars (ni, ni+2), four sextets of bi-
fundamental fermions: (ni, ni+1), i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4  0.

this theory has a string theory realization, as type iib on ir6/zz2, clearly has vanish-
ing planar beta function and hence would have dilaton-free dual ads5  rp5 background.

it has interesting features which will be explored elsewhere [14].
