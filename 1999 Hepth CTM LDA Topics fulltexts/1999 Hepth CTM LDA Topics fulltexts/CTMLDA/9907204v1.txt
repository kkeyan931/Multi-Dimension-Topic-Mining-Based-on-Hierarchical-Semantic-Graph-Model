abstract

we use the ads/cft duality to study the special point on the coulomb branch
of n = 4 su (n ) gauge theory which corresponds to a spherically symmetric shell
of d3-branes. this point is of interest both because the spacetime region inside
the shell is at, and because this conguration gives a very simple example of
the transition between d-branes in the perturbative string regime and the non-
perturbative regime of black holes. we discuss how this geometry is described in
the dual gauge theory, through its eect on the two-point functions and wilson
loops. in the calculation of the two-point function, we stress the importance of
absorption by the branes.

the ads/cft correspondence [13] allows us to study any asymptotically ads ge-
ometry. much work on this correspondence has focused on learning about the eld
theory from known properties of the supergravity, and hence has concentrated on the
study of perturbations on a pure ads background. however, to study the implications
of the duality for gravitational physics, it is interesting to consider a larger class of
spacetimes.

a particularly interesting set of questions in the ads/cft correspondence regards
how the correspondence describes black holes. we would especially like to understand
how to treat black hole formation, how to describe the observations of infalling observers
and compare them with observations made outside, and nally how (or whether) the
correspondence addresses issues of unitarity.

as an intermediate step on the path to such questions, one would like to consider
the simpler problem of the collapse of a shell of three-branes to form a black brane.
there are static shell solutions that are special cases of an interesting class of solutions
corresponding to multi-center d3-brane geometries where the distribution of d3-branes
has some special symmetry; that is, to special points on the coulomb branch of the
gauge theory. some geometries of this type were obtained in [4], as the extreme limits
of families of rotating d3-brane metrics. solutions with d3-branes distributed in disks
of various dimensions were also studied in [5], where the two-point function and wilson
loops in these backgrounds were discussed.

in the present paper, we will consider the geometry introduced in [4], where the d3-
branes lie in a spherically symmetric shell, so that the whole so(6) rotational symmetry
of the pure ads5  s 5 space is preserved. in this case, the metric is
5),

k) + h 1/2(dr2 + r2d2

ds2 = h 1/2(dt2 + dx2

(1)

where h = 1 + r4/l4 for r < l, and h = 1 + r4/r4 for r > l. (since the spacetime is
static, one could equally well consider a euclidean solution, but our main interest will be
in the lorentzian case.) in the near horizon limit, which is r, l  r in these coordinates,
the spacetime is the ads5  s 5 spacetime with curvature radius r outside the shell, and
at spacetime inside the shell. a rescaling of the coordinates shows the near-horizon
region includes the whole ads5  s 5 spacetime. this near-horizon region will be the
main focus of this paper. although the shell is at r = l, its physical radius is r. note
also that the shell is at in the directions xk which are along the individual branes; this
makes it possible to have a static conguration. we give the penrose diagram for this
spacetime in fig. 1. unlike the geometries considered in [5], there is no region of large
curvatures in this spacetime. in fact, since the solution has no weyl curvature, and the
local geometry is maximally supersymmetric, there should be no  corrections at all, by
the argument of [6]. the solution as a whole will preserve only half the supersymmetries;
the other half are broken by the presence of the d3-branes.

if one gives this solution a kick, it will collapse to form a non-extremal black brane,
as shown in fig. 2. we have not yet been able to analytically treat such solutions, so
as a rst step we will instead consider the physics of the one-parameter family of static
solutions interpolating between large and small radius shells. this family provides a very
simple example of a continuous path of congurations that connects the perturbative
and non-perturbative regimes of string theory. in one limit the shell becomes widely
separated d3-branes, easily treated by perturbative string theory, and in the opposite
limit the shell becomes a black brane with strong gravitational eects. it is here that
the ads/cft correspondence and related ideas have suggested profound modications
to our semiclassical notions about black holes, and we are interested to get more hints
about how such modications arise.

our interest in this solution has several other motivations. firstly, the metric is

3

almost as simple as pure ads, being static and having the full rotational symmetry.
this will make it possible to make analytic calculations. secondly, it would seem to
be interesting to study how the at space region in this geometry is described in the
gauge theory, in the hope that this might give more insight into the extension of the
correspondence to asymptotically at boundary conditions. (unfortunately, we will not
make much progress on this issue.) furthermore, analyzing a geometry of this kind forces
us to address the non-locality in the correspondence, since the geometry outside r = l
is exactly ads5  s 5, and it will therefore not signal its non-triviality in the one-point
function hoi of any operator dual to a supergravity eld. finally, these congurations
pose a new challenge to the ads/cft duality: as well see, the supergravity predicts a
spectrum of resonances that is not yet understood from the yang-mills perspective.

the statement regarding vanishing of the one-point functions might seem to be in
conict with the identication of this supergravity solution with a point on the coulomb
branch of the gauge theory, since the gauge theory would predict non-zero vacuum
expectation values for the higgs elds x i (giving the positions of the branes in the
transverse space). however, the two points of view can be reconciled so long as none
of the operators which should have non-zero vevs from the gauge theory point of view
live in the short chiral primary multiplets whose dimensions are protected. htr(x i)i will
vanish by the spherical symmetry of the distribution. (at nite n, it may have a value of
o(1/n), since the distribution doesnt have exact spherical symmetry; this corresponds
to a quantum eect that will be invisible from our classical analysis.) an example of a
non-vanishing vev is htr(x ix i)i  l2, but this operator is not a chiral primary, so it
should correspond to some massive string excitation from the bulk point of view. it is
interesting that the gauge theory makes a denite prediction for the value of this vev,
but we were not able to use this to explore the connection between this spacetime and
the gauge theory.

as already remarked in [7, 8], the presence of the shell will aect the two-point
function in the gauge theory, and it should be possible to learn about how it is represented
in the gauge theory by studying this two-point function. the main point of the present
paper is to carry out this analysis of the two-point function,3 and use it to probe the
properties of the shell conguration and the transition from perturbative d3-branes to
congurations with macroscopic horizons. another probe which will be sensitive to the
presence of the shell is a wilson loop, and we will briey discuss the eect of the shell
on the wilson loops at the end of the paper.

according to the prescription of [2, 3], the generating function for correlators in the
gauge theory is identied with the partition function of supergravity, with appropriately

3while this paper was in preparation, [9] appeared, which has a substantial overlap with our calcu-

lation. one important distinction is that we will include the eects of absorption by the shell.

hexp iz 0oi = z[0].

(2)

at large r = (g2n)1/4 (we set ls = 1), we can thus calculate the two-point function
of an operator dual to some test scalar eld propagating in the background (1) in the
semiclassical approximation for supergravity, by calculating the action for the scalar
eld subject to appropriate boundary conditions. for convenience, we will work in
momentum space, so what we want are solutions to the ten-dimensional wave equation
2 = 0 of the form

 = eit+i~k~xk(r, ).

(3)

since the spacetime is spherically symmetric in the s 5, there will be no coupling between
dierent partial waves. in the at region r < l, the appropriate solution for  is

(r, ) =

a
r2 jl+2(q

r2
l2 r)yl ~m(),

where q2 = 2  k2. in the ads region, the solution is

(r, ) = (cid:18) q

(l + 1)!

z2(nl+2(qz) + cljl+2(qz))yl ~m(),

(4)

(5)

where we have introduced the convenient coordinate z = r2/r in the ads region. this
solution behaves as   zleit+i~k~xkyl ~m() as z  0, which are the correct boundary
conditions for it to give the bulk-boundary propagator kb.

if we neglect absorption by the shell, we should require that both  and its derivative
are continuous at the shell. this xes the two constants of integration; in particular, it
gives

where s = qr2/l is a natural dimensionless measure of the energy. as noted previously
in [5, 9], the energy scale associated with the shell from the supergravity point of view

is q  l/r2  l/gn, rather than the much higher scale set by the higgs vevs q  l.

one suggestion for the physics responsible for this scale is that it arises from states
consisting of w-boson-anti-w-boson pairs with large binding energy due to the large
coupling [10].

notice that this two-point function has poles, at values given by the zeroes of the
denominator in cl (6). the characteristic spacing between these poles is given by the
scale l/r2 discussed earlier; asymptotically the spectrum is given by q  nl/r2 for
integer n. from the ads perspective the presence of these poles is understood by noting
that the ads plus shell physics is eectively that of a cavity; the origin is regular, and
there is a growing potential at innity. this geometry will have normal modes, and the
poles in the propagator occur at the corresponding frequencies. note that as the radius
of the shell goes to zero, the geometry approaches that of the charge-n extremal three
brane. allowed modes for this form a continuum. one can see this limit directly in the
above; in this limit the spacing between states vanishes.

nonetheless, the l  0 limit raises a puzzle, as it isnt clear how this limit matches
onto physics at l = 0. indeed, to an infalling observer, it might seem that these are
for l  0, the infalling observer would seem to have a
very dierent congurations:
very painful impact on the shell resulting from the large blueshift acquired on falling in,
whereas the case l = 0 results in a smooth horizon. of course, for any nite l > 0,
conformal symmetry is broken in the boundary theory; from this perspective the limit
isnt necessarily expected to be smooth.4

another puzzle regards the emergence of the above sharp resonances.

it is not
clear how this behavior smoothly goes over into the expected l = 0 behavior, and we
furthermore do not understand their origin in the boundary description. one proposal
is that the spectrum of resonances is a bound-state spectrum of the w-anti-w pairs

4we thank juan maldacena for a discussion on this point.

mentioned earlier. at tree level, the lightest w states have masses  g1/5/r4/5, but
tight binding eects could conceivably produce a spectrum with the spacing  l/r2
found earlier.
we do not have a resolution to these puzzles, but part of the story certainly involves
an important physical eect that we have neglected. a string impinging on a single
d3-brane may be absorbed, converting into open string states on the brane. therefore,
when we send a wave into the shell geometry, it has a nite amplitude to be absorbed by
the shell. in order to produce the resonant behavior responsible for the above poles, the
wave must pass through the shell an innite number of times, which it cant do without
eventually being absorbed. in the presence of absorption the resonances are no longer
innitely sharp. we dont yet have an analytic calculation of this eect, but we will give
some estimates of its magnitude.

to begin, recall that if a wave has a frequency  at innity in the full asymptotically
at solution (or in the pure ads case, at r = r), it will acquire the large blueshift
noted above and have a proper frequency p = r/l when it reaches the shell. for
small l this frequency is quite high even for moderate asymptotic frequencies. at low

frequencies well use known results to estimate this absorption rate. but for p>1 in

string units, one expects the absorption cross section to climb steeply as one encounters
the increasing number of excited open string states that may be created on the brane.
in this region it is dicult to make precise estimates.

for frequencies p < 1, we will estimate the absorption using the results of [12].
consider a plane wave of frequency p incident on a planar conguration of branes
with n branes per unit area; for later correspondence with the shell case, we will take
n  n/r5. the incident wave can create long strings of length  p connecting the
branes. this means that we should think of a single cluster of branes with radius  p
as a single absorber, and we will approximate the absorption cross section for the cluster
by the result for an equal number of coincident branes. this cluster has nef f  n5
branes. for p < 1 the eective radius ref f = (gnef f )1/4 satises pref f  1, and
so the cross-section, which grows like (pref f )8+4l/5
p for the lth partial wave [13], is
dominated by the case l = 0. thus the cross-section for the cluster is

(11)

assuming that the absorption cross-sections for the dierent clusters add, this means
that the sheet of three branes has an absorption cross-section per unit area, or opacity
given by

(12)

so long as the cluster size is small compared to the radius of the sphere, this planar

7

analysis should be a good approximation for spherically symmetric shells. since the
cluster size  p is less than the string scale, this is true in our case.
we can describe this absorption with modied boundary conditions at the plane. we
must always require that the eld itself is continuous at the plane, but the absorption
can be accounted for by introducing a discontinuity in the normal derivative:

[n] = 

(13)
with complex . we use here a notation []  |r=l+ |r=l. from the point of view
of the equations of motion, we are adding a complex potential (r l) to the previous
homogeneous equation. the jump in the probability ux is
[nj]/p = 2im()||2/p .

(14)

we will therefore take

im() 

cl

(15)

the precise value of the real part will not aect the qualitative conclusions. the solutions
in the interior and exterior regions are still given by (4) and (5), but the new matching
conditions will give a dierent value for cl, namely

cl = 

jl+2(s)n 

l+2(s) + nl+2(s)j 

2jl+2(s)j 

l+2(s)  l

l+2(s)  l
qr j 2

qr jl+2(s)nl+2(s)
l+2(s)

.

(16)

furthermore, the action no longer reduces to just a surface term at innity, as the surface
terms induced on r = l by the bulk action inside and outside the shell will fail to cancel
as a result of the discontinuity (13). the action will be

i =

this modies the result (10) to give a two-point function

5this approach to the calculation of the two-point function involves a surface term at the shell.
nonetheless, the boundary two-point function should still be the scaled limit of the bulk two-point
function; the latter also includes a contribution arising from absorption at the shell.

now  is complex, so its presence in the denominator of cl will move half of the poles
in this expression o the real axis a distance proportional to the absorption by the shell.
the remaining poles should be moved to complex values once the nite thickness of the
shell is accounted for. this decay of would-be normalisable modes via absorption by the
shell is described from the eld theory point of view as the decay of a composite object
into pairs of gauge bosons. the fractional width of the resonances are easily estimated
to be o(7r4/l7). for low frequencies the resonances remain extremely sharp and the
last term on the right hand side of eq. (18) is subdominant. at increasing frequency or
equivalently decreasing l they broaden, and we expect these estimates to break down
and the shell to become opaque once the proper frequency at the shell reaches the string
scale. one might hope to match this absorption onto the extremal three brane case at
l = 0, but this remains a puzzle. since the seperation between the resonances is larger
than their width up to p  1, we can only hope to recover the continuum characteristic
of the l = 0 solution above this scale; note that because of the large blueshift, this
corresponds to   l/r, and this energy scale is still lower than the higgs scale from
the gauge theory point of view.
we can also calculate the wilson loops in the boundary gauge theory. we expect
that as the scale of the wilson loop exceeds r2/l, the string worldsheet spanning the
loop will pass from being some minimal surface in the ads part of the geometry to being
stretched straight from the wilson loop to the d3-brane shell. in the original pure ads
calculation, the energy of the minimal surface between two static quarks seperated by d
was found to be [14]

the energy of a pair of strings stretching from the quarks to the surface r = l is

e = 

42r2

(1/4)4d

.

e = 

l


,

(19)

(20)

because it is less than the energy of the strings stretching to r = 0 which were used to
x the zero of energy in this calculation by this amount. hence we see that if d > r2/l,
the straight strings will have less energy than the minimal surface. when d  r2/l, the
minimal surface stretches down to r0  l. thus, we see that there is complete screening
of the quark-anti quark potential for d > r2/l, as in the calculations for disks in [5,15].
a disappointing feature of our results is that we have been unable to access the at
space region. for the two-point function, we can only calculate in a regime at energies
below the higgs scale, and we expect that at higher frequencies the shell will become
eectively opaque, and will prevent the probes from entering the at region. similarly,
in the wilson loop calculation, when the loop is suciently large for the string spanning
it to reach the shell, it simply breaks and terminates on the shell. thus, it seems we
cannot learn anything about at space holography from this solution. this failure may

9

be regarded as having been pregured by the calculation in [16], where it was observed
that the energy/distance relation becomes at in the region of interest.

to summarize, the spherically symmetric shell (1) provides an extremely simple ex-
ample of a supergravity solution corresponding to the coulomb branch of the gauge
theory. however, because of the high degree of symmetry of the solution, none of the
one-point functions of operators dual to supergravity elds can have non-zero values; in
particular, the non-zero higgs vevs are related to expectation values for operators whose
dimensions are not protected, corresponding to massive string elds on the gravity side.
it would be interesting if these expectation values could be estimated from the grav-
ity side; however, lacking a better control of the stringy details, we have had to focus
on studying this solution more indirectly, through the supergravity two-point function
and wilson loop expectation values. our desire to treat the shell realistically, as being
composed of d3-branes, forces us to face a complication in the two-point function calcu-
lations: the boundary conditions at the shell must be chosen to express the absorption
of incident wavepackets onto the 3-branes. we can thus only calculate the two-point
function at very low frequencies. at high frequencies one might hope to use a wkb
approximation, but lack of detailed understanding of absorption presents an obstacle.
taking absorption into account gives the poles in the two-point function an imaginary
part, indicating that they correspond to unstable resonances decaying into gauge elds.
the calculation of the wilson loop is more straightforward, and indicates a sharp cuto
in the quarkanti-quark potential at separations d  r2/l, beyond which there is com-
plete screening of the potential, as in [5]. both eects can be interpreted as part of the
transition from perturbative d-brane behavior to that of a large extremal black brane.
it will be interesting to understand such crossover phenomena in more detail.
