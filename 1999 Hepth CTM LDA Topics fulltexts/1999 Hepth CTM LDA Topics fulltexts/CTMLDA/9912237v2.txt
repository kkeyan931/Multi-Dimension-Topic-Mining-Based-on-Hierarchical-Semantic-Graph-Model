the three-phase version of the hybrid chiral bag model, containing the phase of asymp-
totic freedom, the hadronization phase as well as the intermediate phase of constituent
quarks, is proposed. for this model the self-consistent solution, which takes into ac-
count the fermion vacuum polarization eects, is found in (1+1) d. within this solution
the total energy of the bag, including the one-loop contribution from the diracs sea, is
studied as a function of bag geometry under condition of nonvanishing boson conden-
sate density in the interior region. the existence and uniqueness of the ground state
bag conguration, which minimizes the total energy and contains all the three phases,
are shown.

1 introduction

the idea to describe a hadron as a bounded region of space (the bag ) lled with quark
and gluon elds appears nowadays to be one of the most natural ways of constructing the
eective quantum eld theory with total connement of color objects [1-12]. the boundary
conditions are chosen as to conne the colored particles to the bag without breaking the rel-
ativistic covariance [1-3]. the very possibility of existence of such an object is related to the
change of the vacuum structure inside the hadron. it is supposed that the non-perturbative
vacuum inside strongly interacting particle is completely destroyed, what produces an excess
of energy proportional to the bag volume [1-5]. the stability of this system is provided by the
valence quarks contribution to the total energy proportional to the inverse bag radius. even
the early mit-bag model yielded consistent results for the mass spectrum and other static
characteristics of hadrons with relatively small set of free parameters [6-8]. further develop-
ment of this model has led to taking into account the eects of spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking  one of the most important features of strong interactions at low energies, and
to incorporating the meson elds into the theory which play the role of goldstone bosons
[9-11]. (depending on the number of light-quark avors, it is either the triplet of -mesons
for su(2) group or the octet of - and k-mesons for su(3)). as a result the most consistent
approach to the description of hadronic structure based on bag models has been elaborated
within the framework of so-called hybrid chiral models (hcm) [10-12]. the hcm treat the
nucleon as the little bag with quarks and gluons conned inside, surrounded by a big cloud
of virtual mesons. the latter can be described either by the hedgehog -meson solution
of the skyrme model, or by some more complicated models including vector mesons [13-15].
on the whole, the models of such a type predict correct scales for various static char-
acteristics of non-strange baryons. at the same time, the estimation of certain values may
yield essential quantitative discrepancies, even the sign may be incorrect [12,16]. moreover,
the best hcm results have been obtained for such values of model free parameters (which
are the vacuum pressure constant b, the coupling constant s, the current quark masses,
and the constant of casimir energy z), that dier from their values obtained by means of
other methods [4,5]. these circumstances indicate that the current formulation of hcm
suers from a number of shortcomings.

actually, the most subtle point in the hcm is the cheshire cat principle (ccp) which
is basic for parting space into regions with dierent phases inside of them [17]. the essence
of ccp is the hypothesis [18] that the fermion theory inside of bag and the boson theory
outside are actually equivalent and can be transformed into each other via the bosonization
procedure. therefore none of physical properties of such bag depends actually on the choice
of boundary surface, while the boundary conditions are determined from the bosonization
equations [19]. however, the bosonization, as well as ccp, can be rigorously proved only
in (1+1)d, while in the real (3+1)d world the solution for the bosonization problem is
still absent. as a result, in the (3+1)-dimensional hcm based on ccp there exists a rather
small set of observables (e. g., the topological charge), which do not really depend on the bag
radius [20]. moreover, the phenomenology of strong interactions predicts unambiguously the
existence of the characteristic connement scale about 0.5 fm, and so in the realistic (3+1)d
models the ccp should be strongly violated, regardless on the proof of bosonization.

therefore it seems to be natural to modify hcm as to avoid any relation to ccp and
specic features associated with, such as an innitely thin boundary surface between dif-
ferent phases and corresponding surface action. such a modication appears to be possible

2

provided the correlation between the dierent phases of bag, which are now not assumed to
be equivalent in the sense of bosonization, arises due to some interaction of the real status
taking place in a nite region of space. the latter can be naturally treated as the region of
the intermediate third phase of the bag [21]. the introduction of such an additional phase is
useful also because it allows to introduce the chirally invariant mechanism of the quark mass
generation, hence it can be considered to a certain extent as the phase of constituent quarks,
while the original 2-phase model does not take into account their existence at all. mean-
while, the concept of constituent quarks has been shown to be very ecient in the hadron
spectroscopy. from this point of view the most attractive physically situation is the one,
where the initially free, almost massless quarks (corresponding to large momentum transfer)
transmute rstly into dressed due to interaction massive constituent quarks carrying the
same quantum numbers of color, avor, and spin, and only afterwards there emerges the
purely mesonic colorless phase.

the rst order approximation to such version of the bag is given by the 3-phase hybrid
model with additional constituent quark phase instead of the boundary with vanishing radial
extent [21]. this model allows to take into account three phases: the phase of asymptotic
freedom with free massless quarks, the phase of constituent quarks which acquire an eective
mass due to the chirally invariant interaction with the boson eld in the intermediate region
of nite size, and the hadronization phase where the creation of free quarks is suppressed by
innitely large mass, while the non-linear dynamics of boson eld causes the appearance of
the c-number boson condensate in the form of a classical soliton solution, which ultimately
accounts for the quantum numbers of the whole bag.

in the present paper the toy model of such kind in (1+1)d is considered, where a single-
avor fermion eld is coupled in a chirally invariant way to the real scalar eld possessing a
non-linear soliton solution in the exterior region. the self-consistent solution to the model
equations, which takes into account the eects of fermion-vacuum polarization, is found.
within this solution the renormalized total energy of the bag is studied as a function of the
bag geometry under condition of nonvanishing boson eld in the interior region. it is shown
that by suitable choice of the model parameters the conguration with minimal total bag
energy and containing all three phases, exists and is unique.

2 lagrangian and equations of motion

the division of space into phases is performed by means of the system of subsidiary elds
(x) according to the method of ref. [3, 22]. the essence of this method may be explained
as following. let us consider the lagrangian of the form:

l0 = 1

2 ()2  v () + 1

2 ()2  g2

0w (),

(2.1)

where the coupling constant g0 of self-interaction of eld  is assumed to be large enough
to neglect the matter elds  in the dynamics of  to the leading order, and thereafter to
use  as background elds for the dynamics of s [21,22]. one can obviously construct the
lagrangian containing as many elds (x) as needed with appropriate self-interaction, which
will determine (almost) rectangular division of space into regions corresponding to dierent
phases, while the lorentz-covariance will be broken only spontaneously, namely on the level
of solutions of equations of motion. the latter circumstance allows one to use the framework
of covariant group variables [23] in order to restore the covariance. assuming further that

3

subsidiary elds (x) have already formed the required bag conguration, let us start with
the following lagrangian:

l = i  + 1

2 ()2  (x1 < |x| < x2)(cid:18)m
(|x| > x2)(cid:18)m0

2 h , eig5i

2 h , eig5i(cid:19)
+ v ()(cid:19) .

(2.2)

the commutator of fermion elds in terms, describing the chiral fermion-boson coupling,
ensures the charge conjugation symmetry of the model.

so in initial stage we have the theory of two elds, the spinor eld  and the boson
eld . these elds are free and massless in the region i : {|x| < x1};
in the region
ii : {x1  |x|  x2} the eld  interacts in a chirally invariant way with fermions resulting
in emergence of the eective fermion mass m; and in the region iii : {|x| > x2} the eective
fermion mass increases up to m0 and the self-interaction of  switches on, providing the
appearance of a soliton solution for the boson eld in this region. note that in this model the
vacuum pressure term appears to be redundant, since due to the existence of the intermediate
phase the diracs sea polarization behaves very specically and ensures itself the required
inward pressure. moreover, in our model there is no special need in valence fermions,
since it is the boson condensate in the form of the topological soliton, which accounts now
for all the bags quantum numbers, represented by the topological baryon number in this
simplest case. the latter point makes it dicult to explain the need for the vacuum pressure
term in this model too.

in order to provide the connement of fermions we assume the mass m0 to be very large,
what leads to the dynamical suppressing the fermion eld in the exterior region iii. at
the same time, in the region of asymptotic freedom we have free (decoupled from fermions)
massless scalar eld and so the nonvanishing density of the boson condensate. this situation
does not contradict the general concept of bag models, and can be treated as one of possible
versions of the 3-phase model. another possibility with vanishing scalar eld in inner region
has been studied in detail in ref. [21]. let us assume also, that the solution of equations of
motion for the boson eld is an odd topological soliton. the case of an even soliton with
nonvanishing scalar eld inside is of no interest, since in this case the trivial solution (scalar
eld is a constant equal to one of minima of self-interaction potential v ()) is the only
energetically preferable.

let us consider now the behavior of elds in detail. according to the general approach
accepted in hybrid models we consider the boson eld in the mean-eld approximation, i. e.
it is assumed to be a c-number eld. neglecting temporarily the explicitly lorentz-covariant
description, well consider the center-of-mass system of the bag, where (x) is stationary
classical eld being a background for evolution of fermions. the equations of motion read:
in the region i

i  = 0,
 = 0,

in the region ii

(cid:16)i   meig5(cid:17)  = 0,
2 hh , 5eig5ii,

m

 = ig

4

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

(2.4a)

(2.4b)

and in the region iii

(2.5a)

(i   m0eig5) = 0,
 + v () = 0 ,

(2.5b)
where h
i in eq. (2.4b) stands for the expectation value in a given bag state. to simplify
calculations, we put further g = 1, because the dependence on it can be easily restored by
means of the substitution   /g. then the spectral problem for fermionic wave functions
 with denite energy  reads

 = i

 + ei5 [m(x1 < |x| < x2) + m0(|x| > x2)] .

(2.6)

to complete the formulation of the spectral problem, the following boundary conditions have
to be imposed

i1(x2) + ei5(x2)(x2) = 0 ,

(2.7)

provided with the condition of continuity for (x) on boundaries separating the regions i
and ii. note that the boundary conditions (2.7) are actually the standard chiral boundary
conditions for the hybrid models [9-12]. however, they arise now as a direct consequence
of an innite mass of fermions in the region iii, rather than from the local surface action,
what is not completely correct [21]. in the region i the equation (2.6) is the equation for
free massless fermions

while in the intermediate region ii one has

i = i
i ,

ii = i

ii + mei5ii .

(2.8)

(2.9)

conditions of wavefunctions continuity on the boundary between i and ii are given by

i(x1) = ii(x1) ,

(2.10)

while at points |x| = x2 the wavefunctions satisfy the conditions (2.7). by this the eld
 in eq. (2.9) is not arbitrary but has to be determined self-consistently from eq. (2.4b)
with appropriate continuity conditions imposed on the eld and its derivatives at points
|x| = x1,2.

3 self-consistent solution of bag equations

the essential feature of this bag conguration is the fact, that the self-consistent equations
(2.4) in the closed intermediate region ii of nite size d = x2  x1 possess simple and phys-
ically meaningful solution, which would be unacceptable if these equations were considered
in the innite space. in order to obtain this solution, we perform in the region ii the chiral
skyrme rotation

hence the equation (2.9) and the boundary condition (2.7) transform into

 = exp(i5/2),

2 ) = i

(  1
 + m,
i1(x2) + (x2) = 0

5

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

correspondingly.

it follows from (3.2) and (3.3) that if we assume the linear behavior of the scalar eld in

the region ii, namely

 = const = 2,

then the equation (3.2) becomes the equation for free massive fermions:

 = i + m

(3.4)

(3.5)

with eigenvalues  = . therefore, as we expected, the massless (in the region i) fermions
acquire the mass m in the region ii due to the coupling to eld , and so the intermediate
phase emerges which describes massive quasifree constituent quarks. continuity conditions
for the scalar eld, which should be an odd function, lead us to the unique solution

the equation (3.5) obviously possesses the sign symmetry   , which corresponds to
the unitary transformation of fermionic wave function

(x) = 2x .

(3.6)

   = i1 .
the important point here is, that the axial currents

j5 = i 5ei5 = i+1

coincide for these sign-symmetric states

j5 = i+1 = i +1  = j5 .

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

in general, however, one cannot derive the sign symmetry for the fermion spectrum in our
case from the sign symmetry    in eq. (3.5), because the latter is true only in the region
ii, while the spectrum has to be determined from the dirac equation on the unication of the
regions i + ii. the straightforward solution of equations (2.8-9) with account of boundary
conditions (2.7) and constraint (2.10) gives the following equation for spectrum:

exp(4ix1  2i1) =

1  e2ikd m i(+k)
1  e2ikd m +i(k)

m i(k)

m +i(+k)

m i(+k)

1  e2ikd m i(k)
1  e2ikd m +i(+k)

m +i(k)

,

(3.10)

where 2 = k2 + m 2 and 1 = (x1). analysing the equation (3.10) one easily nds that
the fermionic spectrum reveals the symmetry   , if

4x1  21 = s ,

(3.11)

where s is integer, since for such values of the derivative of the eld (x) the l. h.
s.
of equation (3.10) reduces to (1)s exp(4ix1). however, in our case 1 = 2x1, hence
the equation (3.11) leads to the single possibility s = 0, while the parameter  remains
arbitrary. this result diers crucially from the case considered in [21], where 1 = 0 by
virtue of vanishing of the boson condensate in the region i, and so the set of solutions
with dierent s 6= 0 emerges. in the latter case, however, the equation (3.11) produces the
non-trivial relation between  and x1.

6

according to eq. (2.4b), in the region ii (x) is determined by the v.e.v. of the c-odd

axial current

with  being now the secondary-quantized dirac eld in chiral representation (3.1)

j5 = 1

2 h , i5ei5i

= 1

2 h+, i1i

,

(x, t) = xn

bnn(x)eint ,

where n(x) are the normalized solutions of the corresponding dirac equation, and bn , b+
n are
fermionic creation-annihilation operators, which obey the canonical commutation relations

{bn, b+

n}+ = nn ,

{bn, bn}+ = 0 .

(3.14)

the average over the given bags state includes, by denition, the average over the lled sea
of negative energy states n < 0 + possible lled valence fermion states with n > 0 , which
are dropped for the moment because their status is discussed specially below. finally,

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.15)

hj5i = hj5isea = 


1

2 xn<0 1


 +
2 xn>0

n i1n .

let us emphasize, that in (3.15) the division of fermions into sea and valence ones is made in
correspondence with the sign of their eigen-frequencies n, which dier from sign-symmetric
n by the shift in 

(3.16)
and so do not possess the symmetry   . however, if we suppose additionally that
n and  are such that for all n the signs of n and n coincide, i. e. after shifting by 
none of ns changes its sign, then the condition n
< 0 in eq. (3.15) will be equivalent to the
condition n

n = n +  ,

>

>

< 0 . hence

hj5isea = 


1

2 xn<0 1


 +
2 xn>0

n i1n = 0

(3.17)

by virtue of relation (3.9). in turn, it means that the eq. (2.4b) in the region ii reduces
to  = 0, what is in excellent agreement with the assumption that (x) = const in the
region ii. in other words, we obtain the solution of coupled equations (2.4) in the region ii
in the form of the linear function (3.6) for the scalar eld, and the equation (3.16) for the
fermion energy spectrum, where n is dened from eq. (3.10) after replacing the l. h. s. to
exp(4ix1).

there are the following keypoints, that make this solution meaningful. the rst is the
niteness of the intermediate region size d, because for an innite region ii the solution (3.6)
is obviously unacceptable. in our case, however, the size of the intermediate region is always
nite by construction, and the boson eld (x) acquires the solitonic behavior in the region
iii due to the self-interaction v (). here the following circumstance manifests again:
in
(1+1)d the chiral coupling ei5 itself cannot cause the solitonic behavior of the scalar
eld by virtue of the eects of fermion-vacuum polarization only, i.e. without additional
self-interaction of bosons [25].

another important circumstance is the calculation of the dirac sea average of axial
current j5 by means of the symmetry   . the point is that for such kind of averages

7

another consistent denition is possible, namely, via so called -invariant, which is often used
for the study of fermion vacuum polarization eects [26]:

0
hj5isea = lim


1

2 xn<0

e|n|+

n i1n  1

2 xn>0

en+

n i1n
 .

(3.18)

since the spectrum of n is not symmetric, the expression (3.18) doesnt vanish, in contrast
to the average (3.17). the expression (3.18) with connection between n and n taken into
account, transforms into

lim

sinh 
0
xn>0

en+

n i1n



 ,

(3.19)

and for   0 the sum in (3.19) diverges as 1/, so such hj5i appears to be proportional to
 and doesnt vanish unless  6= 0. the same makes the r.h.s.of eq. (2.4b), and so the linear
functions will not be the solution of this equation in the region ii.
moreover, this is true for other fermionic averages too, in particular for the v. e. v. of
the fermion charge. in our approach, by virtue of discreteness of the fermionic spectrum,
the vacuum value of the charge is zero, in analogy to the case of the axial current. namely,
if the c-odd expression for the charge

q = 1

2 z dx [+, ] ,

(3.20)

is used, then under the same conditions of sign-correspondence between n and n for each
n, one obtains for the average of q the following

hqi = hqisea = 1

2 xn<0 1
however, if hqisea is dened via -invariant, then one obtains

= 1

2 xn<0 1

2 xn>0

2 xn>0

= 0.

(3.21)

0
hqisea = lim


1

2 xn<0

e|n|  1

2 xn>0

en

 6= 0

(3.22)

for  6= 0 by virtue of absence of the symmetry   . nethertheless, there are serious
reasons to consider the relations (3.17) and (3.21) as the most adequate way of calculation
the sea average in our problem. first, -invariant is actually the measure of the hamil-
tonian asymmetry, rather than the fermion charge of the ground state. second, the other
regularization schemes besides of thermal regularization are possible for divergent sums such
as hj5i and hqi. also, there is no warranty that the regularized expressions (3.18) and
(3.22) would produce the correct results for   0. it is easy to give an example, when
the dependence on a parameter in the sum or integral is not continuous, in particular,
f (k) = r 
0 dx sin kx/x = /2 for any k > 0, but f (0) = 0, i.e. in this case the limit of the
integral for k  0 and its exact value at k = 0 are dierent.
let us consider further an adiabatic process of changing the gradient of the boson eld 
in the region ii, starting from  = 0. in the initial moment n = n, so any c-odd fermionic
sea average obviously disappears: h. . . isea  0 for any reasonable regularization scheme.
now let us take into account that in our case the fermionic spectrum is discrete and depends

8

on  continuously, so for  small enough all the ns keep their signs. then from general
grounds h. . . isea should vanish still, although the spectrum n is already non-symmetric
and so the -invariant is nonzero. therefore it is reasonable to assume that in this case
the thermal regularization can yield physically inconsistent results for c-odd quantities such
as the axial current and the fermion charge of the vacuum. it is worth-while to note the
essential dierence of this situation from the case of innite space, when the spectrum is
continuous. in the latter case, the density of states changes for any small change of , and
so all the averages change too, what gives rise to the eect of induced fermion numbers [26].
finally, it is possible to check the self-consistency of solution (3.6) numerically. in this
case the problem is solved on a lattice, and so the number of degrees of freedom, as well as
the number of fermion levels, is nite, so one doesnt need any regularization at all. the
results of these calculations show that the linear function (3.6) and the vanishing averages
are the only self-consistent solution to this problem.
the interpretation of this result is as following.

in our case the boson eld has no
discontinuities at all (it doesnt vanish in the region i, too), and is topologically equivalent
to the odd soliton which would take place in absence of fermions due to the self-interaction
v () only. therefore, the topological number does not depend on the existence and sizes
of the spatial regions with fermions (i and ii). on the other hand, the baryon charge of
the hybrid bag is, by denition, the sum of the topological charge of the boson soliton and
the fermion charge of the bag interior. the latter one is zero in our case, hence the baryon
charge is determined completely by the topological charge of the boson eld, and so does
not depend on the sizes of the regions i and ii, in correspondence with the general ideology
of hybrid models. therefore, in our approach the hadron is a composite particle, which
consists of the boson soliton, to which the fermion bag is coupled through the interaction in
the intermediate region ii. note also, that although quantum numbers of such a composite
particle are completely determined by the soliton, it doesnt mean that the lled fermion
levels with positive energy should not exist at all. this could take place for small enough
values of the parameter  only.
if  increases, the negative levels n = |n| +  will
unavoidably move into the positive part of the spectrum. the change of sign of each such
level will decrease hqisea by one unit of charge, but if we ll the emerging positive level with
the valence fermion, then the sum qval + qsea remains unchanged. analogously, the total
axial current will be equal to jval + jsea and will not change too, what ensures the vanishing
r.h.s. of (2.4b) and so preserves the status of linear function (3.6) as the self-consistent
solution of the eld equations. in other words, by denition the ground state of the bag is a
state in which all the levels with n < 0 are lled (the inequality is strong, because there are
no levels with  = 0 in the considered case). the existence or absence of valence fermions in
such construction of the ground state of the bag depends actually on the relation between 
and |n|min, and so appears to be a dynamical quantity like the other parameters of the bag
(the size and mass), which are determined from the total energy minimization procedure.

4 the total energy of the bag

on the unication i + ii the boson soliton takes a form of the linear function (3.6). this
function (after rescaling   /g) is sewn together with the soliton solution of eq. (2.5b) in
the exterior region by means of the continuity conditions for the eld and its derivative. to
preserve the generality of consideration, in the region iii well use the asymptotic expansion

9

of the soliton solution of eq. (2.5b) for large |x|, namely
g (cid:16)1  aemx(cid:17) ,

sol(x) =



x > x2 ,

(4.1)

with m being the meson mass in the exterior region of the bag, while for x < x2 sol(x)
is determined by oddness. the factor /g means that we deal actually with a phase soliton
with topological charge being multiple of 2/g, since it is the period of the initial chiral
interaction  exp(i5g). the constant a is determined from the continuity condition for
boson eld at points x = x2. note that in the exterior region there is no chiral invariance
due to the phenomenology of strong interactions on the one hand, and on the other due to
the specic features of (1+1)d scalar models, which make the presence of the meson mass
the necessary condition for the required soliton prole to be formed.

the continuity conditions at x = x2 give

2x2 = (cid:16)1  aemx2(cid:17)

2 = maemx2.

then one nds the relation between the parameter  and the bags size x2:

whence the total energy of boson soliton can be represented as

2 = 

m

mx2 + 1

,

e =

2
g2

m

mx2 + 1

.

the total energy of the bag consists of e and of the fermionic contribution e

ebag = e + e.

(4.2a)

(4.2b)

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

it is obvious from (4.4), that the energy of the boson eld is a smooth function, which
decreases for x2  , producing no vacuum pressure in spite of the fact, that the gradient
of  in the domain i + ii yields the constant positive contribution to the energy density
1
2 2 = 22, which could be identied with the vacuum pressure b in the standard hcm.
actually, it is an artifact of one spatial dimension in our problem: when the bags size
increases, the gradient of  in i + ii will always decrease in any number of space dimensions
by virtue of (4.3), while the volume of domain i + ii in 1(space)d increases only linearly
and so cannot compensate the decreasing of , what takes place in 2- and 3-(space)d. so
in (1+1)d the non-trivial dependence of the total energy ebag of the bag on the model
parameters could originate only from the fermion contribution e, which is given by the
sum of the diracs sea of lled negative energy states and positive energy valence fermions

e = eval + esea .

(4.6)

for the ground state of the bag described above, the sum (4.6) can be reduced to the single
universal expression by taking into account, that the charge conjugation symmetry dictates
the following denition of the diracs sea energy [25,27]

esea = 1

2 xn<0

n  1

2 xn>0

n .

10

(4.7)

if the transition from n to n is sigh-preserving for all n, and so there are no valence fermions
in the ground state of the bag (in order to provide the vanishing v.e.v. for the charge and
axial current), one nds from (4.7)

if the parameter  appears to be large enough, so that the initially negative level n =
|n| +  changes its sign and turns into the lled valence state, it is convenient to calculate
e in two steps. first, we consider the contribution from all states with |n| >  to esea,
which in analogy to (4.8) reads
(4.9)

e

m .

sea =  xm>

to this expression the energy of the valence fermions eval = |n| +  and the contribution
of the positive levels with n = |n| +  should be added, what yields

e = |n| +   1

2 [(|n| + ) + (|n| + )] + e

sea =  xn>0

n ,

(4.10)

i. e. the same eq. (4.8) as we have got for the energy of fermions without lled valence
states.

it is convenient to introduce a set of new parameters, in terms of which the total energy
of the bag will be expressed in the most appropriate form. first of all, we introduce the
dimensionless quantities

 = 2mx1 ,

 = 2md,

 = 2mx2 ,

(4.11)

and consider the eq. (3.10) in their terms. this equation has two branches of roots. the
rst one corresponds to real k and in terms of parameters  and  is determined from

x

x cos x + sin x

tan(cid:16)1 + x2(cid:17) =

x2 + 1

(4.12)
where the unknown quantity is the dimensionless x dened through k = mx,  = m1 + x2.
the real roots xn belong to the half-axis 0  xn < , since the fermionic wave functions are
actually the standing waves in a nite spatial box with degeneracy in the sign of k, while
the corresponding frequencies n lye in the interval m  n < .
the second branch corresponds to imaginary k = imx,  = m1  x2 , 0  x  1, and
can be derived from (4.12) by means of the analytical continuation

1  cos x + x sin x

,

tan(cid:16)1  x2(cid:17) =

x

1  x2

x cosh x + sinh x
cosh x + x sinh x  1

.

(4.13)

for this branch 0 < n  m.
therefore, n and e appear to be the functions of two independent dimensionless pa-
rameters  and , the sum of which denes the dimensionless size of the connement domain


proceeding further, it is convenient to extract the mass of a constituent quark m from
the sea energy and fermion frequencies as a dimensional factor:

 +  =  .

(4.14)

n = mn,

n = q1 + x2

n ,

11

(4.15)

hence e = m pn n. introducing further the dimensionless ratio of the two model mass

parameters

 = m/2m ,

(4.16)

and the dimensionless total energy e bag = ebag/m, for the latter one nds

e bag = e (, ) +

2
g2

2

 + 1

.

(4.17)

let us note, that in this case the independent model parameters are , , which dene the
sizes of the inner bags regions, while  is determined from (4.14). in this point the present
version of 3-phase model diers from the one considered in [21], where ,  are dened
unambiguously by  and . so the total bags energy depends ultimately on the following
dimensionless parameters: , g and , , where the parameter  is xed by the ratio of the
masses m and m, while the optimal values of ,  for the ground state should be found
from the condition of minimum of the total energy for given .

the dimensionless fermion sea energy e , which obviously diverges in the upper limit,
should be regularized, so a consistent renormalization procedure is required. first, let us
it is
consider the asymptotics of roots of eq.
convenient to rewrite the eq. (4.12) as

(4.12) in the uv-domain, when xn  1.

sin 1 + x2 =

= 1

2 (1 + x2 + x) sin(cid:16)1 + x2 + x + (cid:17) + 1

2 (1 + x2  x) sin(cid:16)1 + x2  x  (cid:17) ,

(4.18)

where  = arctan x . one can show that

xn(, ) =

/2 + n



+

(1)n+1 sin [(/2 + n)/] + 1  /2

/2 + n

+ o(1/n2) .

(4.19)

in the expression (4.19) the rst term leads to the quadratic and linear divergences in pn n,

and the second one contains the logarithmic divergence, while the term with the sine does not
yield any divergence at all. therefore, the uv-regularization consists in the compensation of
the rst term and the divergent part of the second term in the asymptotic expression (4.19).
as a rst step we use that obvious fact, that only the dierence between two energies is
physically meaningful, rather than the energy itself. it could seem, that the most natural way
is to choose the energy of the free fermions sea in the similar volume  as the reference point
for e . however, it has been shown in [21], that this subtraction fails in our case because
this energy appears to be innitely larger than any conguration with  6= 0, even after any
possible counterterms are added. such an innite energy barrier between the regularized
e (, ) and the free fermion sea corresponds perfectly well to the intuitive feeling that the
free fermions can hardly be a reasonable rst approximation to the connement problem.
as a result, in this case there is no unique prescription for the choice of subtraction point
in the renormalization of e (, ), what is actually the common feature for the majority
of bag models [10,12,28]. in the classical renormalization procedure, the uncertainty in
the choice of subtraction point is cancelled by xing the physical values for corresponding
number of parameters. for obvious reasons, we wont do that in our toy (1+1)d model, but
instead will consider the most straightforward approach to the compensation of divergences
in the sum (4.10), which preserves the continuous dependence of the result of subtraction

12

on the model parameters. this approach is based on the subtraction from pn n the other

sum with the same summation index n, the common term of which coincides exactly with
the divergent part of asymptotics (4.19), resulting in the nite quantity

e  = xn "n  /2 + n



+

1 + /2

/2 + n!# .

(4.20)

this method requires no counterterms because all the divergencies are already cancelled by
the subtracted sum. of course, to some extent the physical meaning of such procedure is
lost. however, it should be emphasized, that it is only the (1+1)d case, when the theory
with coupling li = g (+i5) is (super)renormalizable and any counterterm has explicit
physical meaning. for higher space dimensions this is already not true, and so the procedure
of compensation of divergences in the energy based on (4.20) should not be considered as
having no motivation. for more detailed discussion on the extraction of nite part from the
divergent diracs sea energy see refs. [28-31].

proceeding further, let us turn to the study of the total bags energy

e bag = e (, ) +

2
g2

2

 + 1

(4.21)

as a function of parameters , . the analysis of the contribution of convergent logarithmic
part from the sine-term in the asymptotic expression (4.19) to e  yields the rst feature of
e bag. let us transform this contribution to the form

(cid:16)e (cid:17)log

(, ) =

and then use the wellknown relation

1

 xn1

(1)n sin [(/)(n + 1/2)]

n + 1/2

(4.22)

(1)n sin [z(n + 1/2)]

n + 1/2



xn=0

= ln tan(/4 + z/4) .

(4.23)

it is easy to see, that the sums (4.22) and (4.23) have the similar common term, and the
sum (4.23) diverges as  ln(  z) when z  . hence, for /   , what means either
  0, or    for nite , the sum (4.22) will show the similar behavior, namely

(cid:16)e (cid:17)log

(, )  

1


ln(/) ,

/  0.

(4.24)

therefore, both the regularized fermion energy (4.20) and the total bags energy possess
the logarithmic singularity for   0, and at the same time the logarithmic increase for
   and nite . note that although the possibility of smooth transition to a 2-
phase conguration, when d  0, exists formally for the initial lagrangean (2.2), actually it
disappears due to the singularity for   0. in other words, in such 3-phase model the radial
extent of the intermediate phase can be suciently small, but not zero, what corresponds to
the general physical treatment of the structure of many-phase systems.

e bag will also grow for    and nite . because the increase of  yields the increase
of , in this case /  0, hence the logarithmic term (4.22) becomes negligibly small,
and the main contribution is provided by the next terms in expansion in 1/n. however, it is
technically more convenient to use the fact that for    the fermionic spectrum becomes

13

quasicontinuous with the exception of a small vicinity of fermi surface with zero energy,
what allows to transform the sums over xn into integrals over dx. in particular, the analysis

of distribution of the roots of eq. (4.12) shows, that for this limit pn n is approximated by

the following (divergent) integral


 +

1

1 + x2 + 

for the subtracted sum in (4.20) one can easily nd

1

 z dx 1 + x2

 .

(4.25)

(4.26)

the integrals (4.25) and (4.26) have the same divergent part

1

 z dx (x + 1/x + /2x) ,

so their dierence yields a converging integral, in agreement with the subtraction procedure.
the leading term of the intergrand in this dierence, taken with the (correct) inverse sign, is
/8x3. this nally leads to the emergence of the positive, proportional to , contribution
to e , and correspondingly to e bag.
finally, for   0 and nite  there is no singularity in e  and e bag at all, what is a
direct consequence of the analysis performed in ref.[21], where it has been shown that the
renormalized e s for  = 0 and nite  6= 0 dier always by a nite value. therefore it
is the soliton energy e  and so the current values of parameters  and g, which play the
main role in this domain. more exactly, for  being not too small, the dependence of e  on
g will be such that for suciently small g the sharp enough increase of e bag takes place for
  0 and nite , providing the existence of a well-dened minimum. on the contrary,
the sucient increase of g (or   0) could make e  to be negligibly small (and almost
constant) for any bags size, and then the minimum in the total energy disappears.
the numerical calculation conrms completely such qualitative predictions for the behav-
ior of e  and e bag. however, due to the absence of singularity in e bag for  = 0 the question
about the existence of the minimum of the total bags energy considered as a function of
, , and therefore the existence of a stable ground state of the bag itself for given  and
g can be answered only numerically. such calculation has been performed for  = 0.25,
what corresponds approximately to the ratio m/2mq, where the constituent quark mass
is assumed to be equal to 300 mev, and for g = 1. the qualitative behavior of e bag as a
function of ,  is shown on the fig.1, from which one can easily see, that the total energy
reveals the unique minimum for non-zero values of , . on the fig. 2 the equal energy
curves are shown, what allows to observe this minimum of energy more explicitly. in the
case under consideration the values of  and  in the minimum dier by two orders, i. e.
the size of the intermediate region appears to be essentially smaller than that of the inner
one. therefore to some extent it can be treated as a smeared boundary between the phase
of asymptotic freedom and the purely colorless phase. on the fig. 3 the scheme of fermionic
levels in the vicinity of zero energy is presented for this conguration, which shows that in
this case the ground state contains one lled valence level with positive energy.

5 conclusion

the aim of the present study is the construction of a consistent model of a hybrid chiral bag,
in which the exact equivalence between fermionic and bosonic (meson) phase is not assumed.
our results show that such a model can be actually formulated in a quite consistent manner,
and to certain extent could be more eective way of description of low-energy hadron physics
compared to the traditional hcm.

first, let us note, that the initial formulation of the model is a local eld theory, and
in spite of the variety of classical solutions one needs to deal with, the covariance is broken
only spontaneously, and so can be restored by means of the methods of refs.
[23] using
the covariant group center-of-mass variables for a localized quantum-eld system. besides
this, the positive points of this approach are: the more correct derivation of chiral boundary
conditions, by which any term in the initial lagrangian has exact physical meaning; the pres-
ence of an intermediate phase describing quasifree massive constituent quarks; physically
acceptable behavior of the total energy of the bag as a function of its geometry. moreover,
in this model the condition of fermion connement, incorporated into it from the very begin-
ning, shows up more explicitly. it manifests, in particular, in the fact that there is no need
in the term with vacuum pressure b, which in the standard approach is inserted into the
model by means of some extra assumptions, since in our case the diracs sea polarization
itself produces the innite increase of energy at large distances.

the important question of the choice of method of calculation of the diracs sea averages
for fermion bags should be also emphasized. the method we used is based on the discreteness
of the fermion energy spectrum, what by means of quite obvious considerations leads to very
simple solution of the self-consistent equations of the bag in the intermediate region. note,
however, that in spite of arguments in favor of such method of calculations, we cannot
completely reject alternative methods like thermal regularization. the question of which
one is more adequate to the physics of the problem should be answered only by means of
detailed study of realistic models.

compared to ref.[21], the specic feature of the considered model is that the condition
of nonvanishing density of the boson condensate in the interior region aects crucially the
amount of possible bag congurations, which provide the local minima of the energy.
in
[21] the boson eld vanishes in the inner region, what leads to an innite set of such
ref.
congurations with the same topology and innitely increasing size and energy with the main
dierence between them being the value of gradient  of the boson eld in the intermediate
region. in the present case, there exists not more than one such a conguration, and the
excited bag states of greater energy can be obtained only by adding a number of valence
fermions. so within the framework of 3-phase modication of the hybrid model there are
possible quite dierent versions of description of composite particles like hadrons and their
excitations.
