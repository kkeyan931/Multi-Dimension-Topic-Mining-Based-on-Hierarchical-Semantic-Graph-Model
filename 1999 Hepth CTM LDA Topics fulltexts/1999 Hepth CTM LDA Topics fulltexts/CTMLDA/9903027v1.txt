abstract

we give a construction of o-shell tree bosonic string amplitudes, based on the

operatorial formalism of the n -string vertex, with three external massless states

both for open and closed strings by requiring their being projective invariant. in

particular our prescription leads, in the low-energy limit, to the three-gluon ampli-

tude in the usual covariant gauge.

one of the main reasons for studying o-shell string amplitudes is the investigation of
the eld theory limit of string theories where the inverse string tension   0 [1] [2]. a
detailed analysis of the relation between string theory and eld theory is non-trivial and

potentially very powerful since string theory manages to organize scattering amplitudes

in a very compact form and in a considerably low number of diagrams. in particular,

closed strings can be used to shed light on perturbative quantum gravity [3].

furthermore, o-shell string amplitudes are relevant in studying processes involving

interactions among d-branes [4].

o-shell extensions of such amplitudes have been studied a great deal until now [1] [2]
[5]  [10] and dierent prescriptions have been given according to the pursued approaches.
in this letter we use the operatorial formalism of the n-string vertex vn ;g [11] for

computing tree open and closed string amplitudes with three external massless states.

this simple case results to be very clarifying about the prescription to use for analyzing

o-shell string physics.

in the framework of the same formalism, in two recent papers [12] [13], o-shell

one-loop amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external massless particles have been

computed both for open and closed strings.

the n-string vertex vn ;g depends on n koba-nielsen variables zis [11], complex in

the closed string case and corresponding to the punctures of the external states, through

n conformal transformations vi(z)s, which dene a local coordinate system vanishing

around each zi, i.e.:

vi(0) = zi.

a choice of such a coordinate system can be regarded as a sort of a gauge choice. when

vn ;g is saturated with n physical string states satisfying the mass-shell conditions, the

corresponding amplitude does not depend on the vis. if these conditions are relaxed, the

dependence of vn ;g on them is transferred to the o-shell amplitude. this is analogous

to what happens in gauge theories, where on-shell amplitudes are gauge invariant, while

their o-shell counterparts are not.

from the gauge choice made for the local maps vis it depends the eld theory gauge-

1

xed lagrangian which generates the amplitudes to be compared with the ones obtained

from string theory in the low-energy limit.

in fact one does not know a priori what

gauge-xing is chosen by the string when the eld theory limit is extracted from its

amplitudes.

the results obtained in ref. [2] in the one-loop case show that it is possible to perform

choices of the vis which, in the case of open bosonic strings, reproduce the eld theory

amplitudes obtained by using the background gauge.

hence it arises the necessity to dene the assumptions underlying the choice of the

functions vis.

the basic assumption we make in this work is that o-shell amplitudes have to be

projective invariant; indeed projective invariance, or mobius invariance, is a crucial prop-

erty if o-shell niteness and factorization are required [14]. the choice of the local maps

around the punctures has therefore to guarantee this invariance.

in the specic case of the amplitude for three massless states it turns out that, in the

limit   0, it depends on the choice of the vis only through the ratio v 
requiring its being projective invariant in this limit allows to select a family of functions

i (0)/(v 

i (0))2.

of the punctures (z1, z2, z3) depending on one parameter. the value of this latter can

be xed by requiring that the sum over all the anticyclic permutations of the lowest

order term in , providing the eld theory tree scattering amplitudes for photons, be

identically zero. in this way we univocally determine the ratio v 

i (0)/(v 

i (0))2.

furthermore, requiring that the whole amplitude, and not only its low-energy limit,

be projective invariant univocally xes v 

i (0) that turns out to coincide with the rst

derivative evaluated in z = 0 of the projective transformation which maps the points
, 0, 1 respectively in zi1, zi, zi+1, corresponding to the so-called lovelace choice [15].
but we would like here to stress that the lovelace choice does not reproduce the value

i (0))2, compatible with our requirement of projective invariance.

of v 

i (0)/(v 
it is possible to show that the value of v 

i (0) so found is the one that ensures that the

string green function at tree level reduces to a particle green function in the eld theory

limit [16].

2

the above prescription yields, dierently from the other results present in literature

[17], an expression of the o-shell three-gluon string amplitude at tree level which re-

produces the corresponding one in eld theory in the most natural gauge, i.e. the usual

covariant gauge, and also coincides with the one obtained by the background eld method

that is the technique in which results relative to higher orders are obtained in literature

[2] [17].

furthermore, the normalization constant c0 is given by 43/k2, where k is the

in order to get o-shell scattering amplitudes among n massless external states from

the previous operator, we have to saturate it on them after relaxing their on-shell condi-

tions. massless states are dened by:

1|0, p > in the open string case,

with gd being the gauge coupling constant of the target space yang-mills theory. the

on-shell conditions we are going to release are the following:

p2 = 0

  p = 0.

(7)

at tree-level, the n-string vertex does not contain any operator that mixes the left and

right sectors of the closed bosonic string. moreover in the three-string case, in which

there is not an integration over the koba-nielsen variables, the amplitude can be simply

factorized in two open string amplitudes [18]. hence, taking one sector of the operator

given in eq. (4), and writing it properly for n = 3 in the case of open bosonic strings,

we get:

the projective invariance of the entire amplitude.

where  is a free parameter. then there exist a family of functions of the punctures

parametrized by . in order to choose a value for that parameter, we ask for our low-

energy amplitude to reproduce a gauge independent result such as the one relative to the

three-photon scattering amplitude which is identically zero. for extracting this amplitude

we sum the expression (12) over all the anticyclic permutations of the indices (1, 2, 3)

(15)

(16)

it is easy to check that the lovelace function does not satisfy this latter equation. by

substituting (16) into (12) we get for the low-energy limit of the amplitude in exam the

[v 

i (0)]p2

i = const.

(19)

from (16) we know that v 

i (0) must be a function of all the punctures, then we can

conjecture it be written as follows:

i (0) = (zi  zi+1)a (zi  zi1)b (zi+1  zi1)c
v 

(20)

where a, b, c, are unknown exponents to be determined by resolving the eq. (19). indeed,

by inserting (20) into (19) we get the following system equations for a, b, c:

1a + p2
p2
p2
3a + p2
p2
2a + p2

2b + p2
1b + p2
3b + p2

3c = 2p1  p2
2c = 2p1  p3
1c = 2p3  p2.




this system admits a unique solution that, using the momentum conservation, is:

a = 1

b = 1
c = 1.




plugging the solution obtained into the expression (20) yields:

v 
i (0) =

(zi  zi+1)(zi  zi1)

(zi+1  zi1)

.

(21)

(22)

(23)

it implies that all the tree green functions that are present in the three-string case, given

by eq.

(9), vanish. the eq.

(23) corresponds to the rst derivative of the lovelace

function vi(z) evaluated at z = 0 [15].

by requiring, then, the projective invariance for the low-energy limit of the amplitude

(12) and asking for this amplitude to reproduce the three-photon scattering amplitude, we

could x the ratio v 

i (0)/(v 

i (0))2; at the same time, by requiring the projective invariance

for the entire scattering amplitude (12) we get a specic prescription for the function

7

v 

i (0).

if the local holomorphic coordinate system vi(z) is chosen to be a projective

transformation satisfying by construction the condition vi(0) = zi, we completely x the

function vi(z) by xing v 

i (0) and v 

i (0)/(v 

i (0))2.

introducing the choices (23) and (16) in (18) gives the following projective invariant

three-open string o-shell amplitude:

(24)

let us now come back to the analysis of the eld theory limit of the open string

amplitude. we are interested in the evaluation of the three-gluon scattering amplitude.

as it is well-known, at tree level we need to sum the expression in (17) over all the

anticyclic permutations of the indices (1, 2, 3) after having multiplied it by the chan-

paton factor

tr (a1 a2 a3) .

(25)

in this object s are the generators of the su(n) gauge group in the fundamental

representation. through the normalization conditions

tr (a b) =

1
2

ab

the chan-paton factor can be rewritten as:

tr (a1 a2 a3) =

1
4

(f a1a2a3 + da1a2a3) ,

(26)

(27)

where f is an antisymmetric tensor of the internal indices ai and d a symmetric one. an

explicit evaluation of the three-gluon amplitude yields:

a3

0(gluons) = gd (1)

 (2)

 (3)

 f abcn (p

1  p

2) +  (p

3  p

1 ) +  (cid:16)p

2  p

3(cid:17)o .

(28)

this expression perfectly coincides with the one of the three-gluon scattering amplitude

obtained through a covariant quantization of a non abelian gauge theory with gauge

group su(n) or by using the background eld method.

8

in computing a string amplitude in our formalism, the choice of the function vi(z)

seems to be strictly connected with the gauge choice in the eld theory limit of those

amplitudes. since the request of consistency, like that we have here made, together with

the conjecture (20), completely xes vi(z), it turns out that the only way in which the

open string can reproduce the eld theory gauge-dependent result of the three-gluon

scattering amplitude at tree-level is in the usual covariant gauge [2].

let us analyze the closed string case, by extending to it the result in (17). we nd

that the scattering amplitude involving three external o-shell massless states admits the

following low-energy limit:

0 (  0) = k (1)
a3c

(29)

after symmetrizing this expression to eliminate the contribution of the antisymmetric

tensor, we get the scattering amplitude of three gravitons mixed with dilatons:

although the de donder gauge is commonly believed to be the preferred gauge choice

in quantum gravity [19], there are some arguments [20] which suggest that it is not the

one chosen by the bosonic closed string.

9

(30)

(31)

we have investigated this point, following ref. [3], by computing the expansion of the

einstein-hilbert lagrangian coupled to a dilaton eld with the de donder gauge xing

term, up to the third order in the elds. on the complete lagrangian we have performed

the following transformations [3]:

h = h +
 = s d  2

d  2

2

 +



h
.

(32)

(33)

these latter have been determined by requiring that the propagator obtained from

the transformed lagrangian were proportional to the unit tensor given in (31), that is

the expected tensor structure for the string propagator [3]. then the computation of the

three-point function from the lagrangian so obtained has not reproduced the result shown

in (30). this means that, within this comprehension of decoupling gravitons and dilatons,

and in agreement with the arguments of ref.

[20], the closed string does not choose, in

the low-energy limit, the de donder gauge, which, naively, might be considered as the

most natural counterpart of the usual covariant gauge in the open string case.
