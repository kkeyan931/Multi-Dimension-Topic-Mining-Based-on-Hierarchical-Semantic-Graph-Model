abstract

i argue that, in the chaotic version of string cosmology proposed recently, classical and
quantum eects generate, at the time of exit to radiation, the correct amount of entropy to
saturate a hubble (or holography) entropy bound (heb) and to identify, within our own
universe, the arrow of time. demanding that the heb be fullled at all times forces a
crucial branch change to occur, and the so-called string phase to end at a critical value of
the eective planck mass, in agreement with previous conjectures.

the origin of the present entropy of our universe, s0, is one of the deepest cosmological
mysteries. the 2.7 k cosmic microwave background (cmb), if it indeed lls our observable
universe uniformly, contributes a gigantic 1090 to s0. however, as repeatedly emphasized
by many people, most notably by roger penrose [1], such an amount falls very short of
what entropy could have been expected to be, even if we go back to the planckian era, i.e.
to t = tp  1043 s after the big bang. since entropy can only grow, the entropy of our
universe at t = tp , sp , must be smaller than s0; yet, on the basis of the energy content and
of the size of the universe rp at t  tp  lp /c, we might have expected 1

sp  ep rp /ch  p r4

p  (rp /lp )4  10120 .

(1)

the fact that the entropy of our universe must have been at least 30 orders of magnitude
smaller than the value in (1) would nicely explain our arrow of time, by identifying the
beginning of the universe with this state of incredibly small entropy near the planck time [1].
in order to solve the problem, penrose [1] invokes, without much justication, a new weyl-
curvature hypothesis. the expected value given in eq. (1) coincides with the so-called
bekenstein entropy bound (beb) [2], which states that, for any physical system of energy
e and physical size r, entropy cannot exceed sbb = er/ch. this bound is saturated by a
black hole of mass e and size equal to its schwarzschild radius r = ge. if the newly born
universe were a single black hole its schwarzschild radius would have been much larger than
rp , and an even higher entropy, o(10180), would have resulted. what could have made the
initial entropy much smaller than sbb is instead the possibility that the universe, right after
the big bang, was already in a very ordered, homogeneous state. but this is just restating the
puzzle in terms of the usual homogeneity problem of standard (non-inationary) cosmology
[3].

the way the two problems are related can be made explicit by introducing a stronger
bound on entropy, which, unlike bekensteins general bound, should apply to the special
case of (fairly) homogeneous cosmological situations. we shall call it the hubble entropy
bound and formulate it as follows: consider a suciently homogeneous universe in which
a (local) hubble expansion (or contraction) rate can be dened, in the sinchronous gauge,
as:

h  1/6 t(log g) , g  det (gij) ,

(2)

with h varying little (percentage-wise) over distances o(h 1). in this case h 1, the so-
called hubble radius, is known to correspond to the scale of causal connection, i.e. to the
scale within which microphysics can act. in such a context it is hard to imagine that a black
hole larger than h 1 can form, since, otherwise, dierent parts of its horizon would be unable
to hold together. thus, the largest entropy we may conceive is the one corresponding to
having just one black hole per hubble volume h 3. using the bekensteinhawking formula

1throughout this paper we will stress functional dependences while ignoring numerical factors.

for the entropy of a black hole leads to our proposal of a hubble entropy bound (heb):

s < shb  l2

p x

i

h 2
i  nh sh ,

(3)

where the sum runs over each hubble-size region. the last estimate in (3) assumes a fairly
constant h throughout space, and denes nh as the number of hubble-size regions, each
one carrying maximal entropy sh = l2
p h 2. this bound appears to be related, at least in
some cases, to the one recently proposed by fischler and susskind [4] on the basis of the
so-called holography principle. we may thus take shb to stand for hubble or holography
entropy bound according to taste. if one applies the heb to the initial universe, one nds
[4] that, unlike the beb, it is practically saturated. it is widely fullled thereafter [4].

this letter aims at explaining why saturation of the heb naturally takes place at the big
bang in the context of pre-big bang (pbb) cosmology [5]. before proceeding, we note that,
in ordinary ination, the entropy problem is solved [3] by invoking a non-adiabatic reheating
process occurring after ination. since ination has already made the universe homogeneous,
after thermal equilibrium is reached entropy is given by its standard thermodynamic relation
to temperature (here the reheating temperature) as

srh  t 3

rh r3

rh  s0 .

(4)

one thus naturally obtains the correct value. however, unlike what will be shown to be the
case in the pbb scenario, srh fails to saturate the heb since:

shb(t = trh) = l2

p hrh r3

rh = h 1

rh t 4

rh r3

rh = (trh /hrh) srh  srh .

(5)

in order to discuss various forms of entropy in the pbb scenario, let us recall some basic
ideas, which have emerged from recent studies of the latter (see [6] for a review). it now
looks quite certain that generic though suciently weak initial conditions lead to a form
of stochastic pbb, which, in the einstein-frame metric, can be seen as a sort of chaotic
gravitational collapse [7, 8]. black holes of dierent sizes form but, for an observer inside
each horizon measuring distances with a stringy meter 2, this is experienced as a pre-big bang
inationary cosmology in which the t = 0 (hopefully fake) big bang singularity is identied
[8] with the (hopefully equally fake) black hole singularity at r = 0.

we are thus led to identifying our observable universe as what became of a portion of
space that was originally inside a large enough black hole. in general, if we want to achieve
a very at and homogeneous universe, we should better identify our present universe with
just a tiny piece of the collapsing/inating region. for the purpose of this note, however,
this would only complicate the equations without adding new physical information. this
is why, hereafter, we shall identify our present universe with the whole interior of a single
initial black hole.

2note that, while we shall work in the string frame throughout, the same results would also follow in the

einstein frame.

figure 1: at the beginning of the ddi era (t = ti) the entropy of the just-formed black hole,
scoll, coincides with both the beb, sbb, and the heb, shb, while the entropy in quantum
uctuations, sqf , is completely negligible. at the beginning of the string phase, t = ts, both
scoll and shb still have their common initial value. sbb and sqf have grown considerably,
but the latter is still negligible if the string coupling is still small at t = ts. during the
string phase, sqf catches up with scoll rst, and with shb later, i.e. when the energy in the
quantum uctuations becomes critical and exit to radiation is expected (t = tr). finally,
during the radiation and matter-dominated phases, shb grows towards sbb, while our own
entropy stot lags far behind and increases only slowly as the result of dissipative phenomena
and growth of inhomogeneities.

it is helpful to follow the evolution of various entropies with the help of fig.1. at time
t = ti, corresponding to the rst appearance of a horizon, we can use the bekensteinhawking
formula to argue that

scoll  (rin/lp,in)2  (hinlp,in)2 = sbb = shb ,

(6)

where we have used the fact [8] that the initial size of the black-hole horizon determines
also the initial value of the hubble parameter. thus, at the onset of collapse/ination,
there is no hierarchy between the two bounds and entropy is as large as allowed by them.
furthermore, since the collapsing region is large in string (and a fortiori in planck) units,
eq. (6) corresponds to a large number. incidentally, this number is also close to the number
of quanta needed for the collapse to occur [8]. we have also assumed the initial quantum
state to be the ground state. because of the small initial coupling and curvature, quantum
uctuations around it are very small [9], initially, and contribute a negligible amount sqf to
the total entropy.

after a short transient phase, dilaton-driven ination (ddi) should follow and last until
ts, the time at which a string-scale curvature o(ms) is reached. we expect the process not
to generate further entropy (unless more energy ows into the black hole, but this would
only increase its total comoving volume), but what happens to the two bounds? this is
the crucial observation: while the heb also stays constant, the beb grows, causing a large
discrepancy between the two at the end of the ddi phase. in order to show this, let us recall
one of the equations of string cosmology [5], the conservation law:

t (cid:16)egh(cid:17) = t (cid:16)(gh 3) (eh 2)(cid:17) = t (nh sh) = 0 .

(7)

comparing with (3), we recognize that (7) simply expresses the time independence of the
heb during the ddi phase. while at the beginning of the ddi phase nh = 1, and the whole
entropy is in a single hubble volume, as ddi proceeds the same total amount of entropy
becomes equally shared among very many hubble volumes until, eventually, each one of
them contributes a relatively small number. by contrast, it is easy to see that the beb is
increasing fast during the ddi phase since, using (7),

sbb  mr  r4  h 2egr = const.  (hr) ,

(8)

and both r and h grow during ddi. also, having assumed that the string coupling is still
small at the end of ddi, we can easily argue that the entropy in quantum uctuations
remains at a negligible level during that phase.

something interesting happens if we now consider the string phase 3, characterized by a
constant h and . it is easy to nd that, if  > 3h, the heb starts to decrease while for
 < 3h it increases. clearly, the rst alternative leads to a contradiction with the heb,
since scoll cannot decrease. we are thus led to the amusing result that the heb demands

   3h  0 during the string phase as opposed to the  > 0 condition that characterizes

the ddi phase. thus, the heb implies a branch change occurring between the ddi and
the string phase, a well known necessary condition for achieving a graceful exit [11]. the
condition  < 0 for the string phase also follows from (apparently independent) arguments
based on the study of late-time attractors [12, 13].

when will the nal exit to the frw phase occur? it has been assumed [14] that it does

when the energy in the quantum uctuations becomes critical, i.e. when

(9)
where nef f is the eective number of particle species produced. taking hmax  ms, xes
the value of the dilaton at exit, eexit  1/nef f . using known results on entropy production
due to the cosmological squeezing of vacuum uctuations [15], we nd:

qf  nef f h 4

max = eexitm 2

s h 2

maxv  eexitm 3

s v  (cid:16)l2

p(cid:17)exit

v l3

s  shb(ex) ,

(10)

3we concentrate here on the standard pbb scenario [5] and not on its variant [10] in which the ddi

phase ows directly into a low-energy m-theory phase.

4

i.e. saturation of the heb by sqf . unless exit occurs at this point, the heb will be violated
at later times.

we thus arrive, generically, at the situation shown in fig.1. at t = tex  tr, the entropy
in the quantum uctuations has catched up with (and possibly overcome) that of the classical
collapse and has become equal to the heb, shb  (hr)3  1090. by then, sbb is a factor
hr larger, which is precisely the factor 1030 that we are running after. from there on,
the story is simple: our entropy remains, to date, roughly constant and around 1090, while
shb keeps increasing with somewhat dierent rates during the radiation and the matter-
dominated epochs. sbb always remains a factor hr above shb, but this factor, originally
huge, shrinks to unity today, by denition.

in conclusion, the entropy and arrow-of-time problems are neatly solved, in pbb cosmol-
ogy, by the identication of our observable universe with (part of) the interior of an original
black hole. as such, its initial entropy saturates both the heb and the beb and is large
because of the assumed large size (in string or planck units) of the initial black hole. from
there on, there is a natural mechanism to provide saturation of the heb at the beginning
of the radiation-dominated phase, i.e. when the beb lies some thirty orders of magnitude
higher. this is precisely what is needed to account for the initial entropy of our universe,
and to unambiguously identify its time arrow.

we do not wish to conceal the fact that our choice of the initial size of the collaps-
ing/inating region can be objected to, along the lines of refs. [16], as representing a huge
amount of ne-tuning. our answer to this objection has been expressed elsewhere [7]: the
classical collapse/ination process is a scale-free problem in general relativity; as such, it
should lead to a attish distribution of horizon sizes, extending from the string length to
very large scales, including those appropriate for giving birth to our universe. no other
dimensionless ratio is tuned to a particularly large or small value as evidentiated in fig.1
by the three upper curves all originating from the same point at t = ti. finally, we wish
to stress again that the entropy considerations discussed in this note appear to provide new
general arguments supporting previous conjectures on the way pre-big bang ination should
make a graceful exit into standard, post-big bang frw cosmology.

note added: after completion of this work i became aware of a very recent paper [17]

which reaches similar conclusions on the role of h 1 in cosmological entropy bounds.
