abstract.

these notes are the written version of two lectures delivered at the viii mexican
school on particles and fields on november 1998. the level of the notes is basic
assuming only some knowledge on statistical mechanics, general relativity and yang-
mills theory. after a brief introduction to the classical and semiclassical aspects of
black holes, we review some relevant results on 2+1 quantum gravity. these include
the chern-simons formulation and its ane kac-moody algebra, the asymptotic al-
gebra of brown and henneaux, and the statistical mechanics description of 2+1 black
holes. hopefully, this contribution will be complementary with the review paper hep-
th/9901148 by the same author, and perhaps, a shortcut to some recent developments
in three dimensional gravity.

introduction

during the last three years we have witnessed a rapid progress in the string
theory description of general relativity. successfull computations of black hole
entropy for extremal and near extremal solutions [1,2] have made it clear that the
string theory degrees of freedom describes the expected semiclassical behaviour of
general relativity. this is in sharp constrast with the more standard approach to
quantum gravity either based on the path integral approach or the wheeler-de witt
equation which has provided little information about the fundamental degrees of
freedom giving rise to the bekenstein-hawking entropy. in the loop representation
approach to quantum gravity, a computation of the black hole entropy has been
proposed [3,4]. however, in this formulation it is still obscure how to introduce
dynamics, and only the kinematics of spin networks is under control.

in this contribution we shall consider neither string theory nor loop quantum
gravity. instead, we work in the very simple setting of three-dimensional quantum
gravity whose lagrangian describes a well-dened quantum eld theory [5,6]. as
motivations to study three-dimensional gravity, let us mention the following aspects
of it.
(i) it is a mathematically simple theory which combines three important
branches of physics: general relativity, yang-mills theory (with a chern-simons

action), and two-dimensional conformal field theory. (ii) the mathematical tools
are surprinsingly similar to those used in string theory, with a centrally extended
virasoro algebra [7] as one of its main ingredients.
(iii) the space of solutions
contains particle solutions [8] and black holes [9], thus making it interesting from
the dynamical point of view.

in these notes, we shall mainly be interested in quantum black holes in three di-
mensions. our goal is to give, in a somehow self-contained way, a derivation of stro-
mingers [10] proposal for the statistical mechanical origin of the three-dimensional
black hole entropy. we refer the reader to [1114] for the stringy aspects of stro-
mingers result. see also [15] for a recent review. we shall concentrate here on the
gravitational aspects. for a detailed and complete treatment of three dimensional
gravity we refer to the recent book by carlip [16].

in sec.

ii we shall briey review, at the most basic level, some of the main
properties of the schwarzschild solution, as well as the three-dimensional black
hole [9]. in sec. iii we review the chern-simons formulation of three-dimensional
gravity. particular empahsis is given to the absence of bulk degrees of freedom, and
a quick derivation of the ane kac-moody algebra is presented. finally, in sec. iv
we derive the brown-henneaux conformal algebra, and its statistical mechanical
[10,45] implications.

ii classical and semiclassical black holes

a the black hole spacetime

the schwarzschild metric (r > r0),

ds2 = (1  2m/r)dt2 + (1  2m/r)1dr2 + r2d2,

is an exact solution of the einstein vacuum equations

g = r 

1
2

gr = 0,

(1)

(2)

representing the geometry outside a collapsing star of mass m and radius r0. one of
the most surprising predictions of general relativity, which caused much confusion
in the past, is the appearance of a singularity in the metric for the particular value
of r:

r =: r+ = 2m (event horizon).

(3)

if the radius of the star r0 is less that r+ then the solution (1), which is valid for
r > r0, has a singularity at r = r+. furthermore, in the region 0 < r < r+ where
the metric is again regular, r is a timelike coordinate while t is spacelike. finally,
at r = 0 the curvature blows up making gravitational forces divergent there. this
means, in particular, that no observer can reach the singularity without being

destroyed. the possibility of making experiments near the singularity is prevented
by another fact: any observer that crosses the event horizon r = r+ will never
come back, at least not according to the classical einstein equations. we shall
prove this below. quantum mechanically, particles can tunnel out of the black hole
and escape to innity. this is hawkings famous discovery of black hole radiation
[26]. however, according to hawkings description there is no correlation between
the particles that fall into the black hole with the ones that escape. this point is
actually a matter of discussion and there is no agreement yet. we will not have time
here to describe in any detail this very interesting work. we refer the interested
reader, for example, to [24] for a review with an extensive list of references.

let us now briey show how to deal with the r = r+ singularity in (1). this
will allow us to see why observers cannot travel back once they have crossed the
horizon. we shall also infer the value of hawkings temperature via a geometrical
argument.

the analysis that follows does not depend on the details of the schwarzschild
solution but only on some general properties of black holes. we consider general
metrics in d dimensions of the form,

ds2 = f (r)dt2 + f 1(r)dr2 + ds2

d2,

(4)

where ds2
d2 represents the metric of a sd2 sphere, or some other compact or non-
compact surface. the function f (r) satises the following two properties: (i) there
exists a value of r denoted as r+ such that f (r+) = 0; (ii) the derivative of f at
r+ is dierent from zero,

1
2

 

df (r)

dr (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r+

,

 6= 0.

(5)

most known (non-extreme!) black holes have a metric of this form, or at least
there is a plane on which the metric near r = r+ looks like the rst two terms in
(4). the extreme black holes do not fall into the above class of metrics because the
function f (r) has a second order zero and thus  = 0. these black holes play an
important role in string theory because they are related to bps states.

for the schwarzschild black hole, the function f is given by f (r) = 1 2m/r and
f (r+) = 1/2m. this means that  = 1/4m which is indeed dierent from zero.
other examples are: the reissner-nordstrom black hole with f (r) = 1  2m/r +
e2/r2 and e is the electric charge. in this case,  is dierent from zero provided
m 6= e; the 2+1 black hole (to be studied in detail in the next section) with
f (r) = m + r2/l2 and l is related to a cosmological constant; the d-dimensional
schwarzschild solution with f (r) = 1 2m/rd3; plus all the (non-extreme) stringy
black holes [27], as well as other higher dimensional situations [28]. students are
encouraged to compute the value of  for each of these black holes, as we shall see
soon, this number is essentially hawkings temperature for each of these objects.

the metric (4) is singular at the event horizon, just as the schwarzschild metric
is. to cure this singularity we introduce the following new set of coordinates. we
change {r, t} to {u, v} according to,

u = g(r) cosh t,
v = g(r) sinh t,

where the function g(r) is dened by,

g(r) = exp z r dr

f (r)! .

(6)

(7)

this change of coordinates has the following properties. the event horizon r = r+
is mapped into the lines u = v. the metric in terms of u, v reads,

ds2 = 2(r)(dv2 + du2) + r2d2,

(8)

where the function,

2(r) =

f (r)

2g2(r)

,

(9)

is regular at r = r+. the regularity of 2 holds provided f (r) has a simple pole at
r = r+. it is easy to see using lhopital rule that the zero in f (r) is cancelled by
g2(r) provided  is chosen as in (5). note that the above coordinate change does not
depend on the details of the function f (r), provided it has a single pole at r = r+. of
course, our formulae for the conformal factor and change of coordinates reproduce
the usual expressions when applied to particular situations like the schwarzschild
black hole (see [25]).

the coordinates u and v are called kruskal coordinates and their range is  <
u, v < . these coordinates can be compactied (see [25] for more details on this
points) and led to the penrose diagram shown in fig. 11. region i is the black
hole exterior r > r+ and region ii its interior (r < r+). it should be clear from
the gure that an observer situated in region ii cannot go back to region i because
he or she would need to travel faster than light. the fate of any future-directed
(timelike) observer is to hit the singularity.

penrose diagram for a schwarzschild black hole.

1) the penrose diagram shown here assumes asymptotic atness. this means that the function
f (r) satises f (r  )  1. this is not the case for asymptotically anti-de sitter black holes
for which f  r2. the penrose diagram in that case can still be drawn and diers only in the
asymptotic structure, not the properties surrounding the horizon. see second ref. in [9].

b semiclassical black holes. the gibbons-hawking

approximation

the combination of euclidean eld theory together with the coordinate change
(6) suggest in a very direct way that black holes should have a non-zero temperature.
the euclidean formalism (sometimes called the euclidean sector) is obtained by
setting  = it, and the metric (1) becomes euclidean. consider again the change
of coordinates (6) in the euclidean formalism. the hyperbolic functions will be
replaced by their trigonometrical versions and it is clear that the euclidean time
in the euclidean sector, and near
variable needs to be an angle 0   < 2.
the horizon, the change (6) is nothing but the relation between polar and cartesian
coodinates in 2. in fact, the topology of the euclidean schwarzschild black hole
is 2  s2 where the origin of 2 is situated at the horizon r = r+. the euclidean
sector does not see the inner region of the black hole r < r+.
following the usual practice of euclidean eld theory we dene the inverse tem-

perature as the euclidean time period (h = 1),

 =

2


.

(10)

so far this is only a mathematical trick with no real physics meaning. however,
it turns out that the temperature t = 1/ dened in (10) coincides exactly with
hawkings evaporation temperature. for the schwarzschild black hole, we recall
that  = 1/4m, this yields the famous hawking result,

th =

1
h

=

1

8m

.

(11)

now, integrating the rst law dm = t ds we nd the bekenstein-hawking formula
for black hole entropy,

s =

a
4

,

(12)

where a = 4r2

+ is the area of the event horizon (r+ = 2m).

for our purposes, this derivation of the black hole temperature and entropy
has an important meaning: geometry knows that black holes radiates.
in other
words, the very deep origin of hawkings process is not contained only on the
matter elds surrounding a black hole but rather on the gravitational (perhaps
string) degrees of freedom. this point of view is further supported by the gibbons-
hawking calculation of the schwarzschild black hole partition function which we
now describe.

let us briey review here the results presented in [17] in the simplest case of a
non-rotating black hole. our main tool will be again the analogy between euclidean
eld theory and statistical mechanics.

consider the functional integral,

where,

z[h] = z dg ei[g,h],

i[g, h] = 

1

16g (cid:18)zm

gr + 2zm

hk(cid:19) .

(13)

(14)

is the euclidean gravitational action appropriated to x the metric at the boundary.
here hij is the 3-metric induced on m. the boundary term is added to the action
to ensure that i has an extremum when h is xed. dg denotes the sum, modulo
dieomorphisms, over all metrics with hij xed. as it is well known, the formula
(13) is purely formal and cannot be given a precise mathematical meaning. this
is because gravity is not renormalizable and the perturbation expansion for (13)
is not well-dened. to make things worst, the action (14) is not bounded from
below/above, not even in the euclidean formulation. it is possible to nd sequences
of euclidean manifolds mi for which the value of the action (14) goes to minus/plus
innity [18].

although (13) cannot be computed in general, its saddle point approximation
around some classical solutions gives interesting results. incidentally, we mention
here that the evaluation of the action i on classical solutions has become crucial in
the recently discovered ads/cft correspondence [1921]. the rst example of an
evaluation of (13) was performed by gibbons and hawking [17] who considered the
euclidean schwarzschild black hole (1) with mass m. the mass m and euclidean
period  are related by (11) in order to avoid singularities (sources) in the euclidean
metric. the value 2 of z in the saddle point (1) is

z[]  e2/16.

(15)

this result is quite remarkable. the thermodynamical formula for the average
energy m =  log z/ reproduces (11) and conrms that  is the inverse tem-
perature of the black hole. in the same way, the average entropy s = ln z ln z
reproduces (12). this result conrms once again that the black hole thermal proper-
ties are present in a pure quantum theory of gravity, and not only in the interaction
of a classical background metric with quantized elds.

hawkings discovery of black hole evaporation is one of the most important results
in the theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics. we refer the reader, for
example, to the classic books by birrell and davis [29] and wald [30] for a detailed
discussion on quantum black holes, and in particular, quantum eld theory on
curved spacetimes. these books were written before black holes became important
in string theory. see [31] for a review on the string theory approach to black holes.
we shall now depart from the schwarzschild four dimensional black hole and go
down to three dimensions where a black hole solution exists [9] having many of the
features of the schwarzschild solution, but it is far simpler mathematically.

2) actually, the value of i diverges and needs to be regularized. see [17] for details and [33,34]
for an evaluation of i using hamiltonian methods on which the regularization is automatic.

consider the action for three-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological

constant  = 2/l2,

i =

1

16g z g(cid:18)r +

2

l2(cid:19) dx3.

(16)

in three dimensions it is convenient to keep the fundamental constants because,
due to the cosmological constant, there are two fundamental length parameters:
planks length lp = hg and the cosmological radius l.

the equations of motion derived from this action are solved by the (non-rotating)

three-dimensional black hole [9]

ds2 =  8mg +

r2

l2! dt2 + 8mg +

r2

l2!1

dr2 + r2d2.

(17)

angular momentum as well as electric charge can be added easily, see [9].

as for the schwarzschild metric, we can go to the euclidean sector and discover

that the time coordinate is periodic. the associated temperature is,

m
2l2 ,

t3 =

(18)

and the entropy is again given by (12), but now a = 2r+ is the perimeter length
of the horizon.

a word of caution is necessary here. contrary to the schwarzschild case, the
metric (17) is not asymptotically at. this means that the euclidean period can-
not be dened as the proper length of the time coordinate at innity. note that
the limit r   of the euclidean schwarzschild metric yields a well dened metric
at the boundary (innity is not really a boundary) with the topology s1 s2. s1
corresponds to the periodic time coordinate, while s2 to the angular sphere. the
limit r   of (17) is not well dened. at innity, one can only dene a conformal
class of metrics . this is a three-dimensional example of the ads/cft correspon-
dence [1921] rst studied in [7]. a more rigorous denition for the temperature
can be given by noticing that the topology of (17) in the euclidean sector is a solid
torus. the temperature is related to the complex structure of the torus [37,38] by,

 =



2 (cid:18) +

i

l(cid:19) ,

(19)

where  is the period of the euclidean time coordinate, and  is the angular
velocity. in the non-rotating case,  = 0.

as before, one can write down the three-dimensional partition function in the
saddle point approximation provided by the solution (17). this yields [9] (see also
[52] for a lagrangian approach),

z3  e2l2/(2g),

(20)

and it is direct to check that the thermodynamical formulae for the average energy
and entropy is consistent with (18).

our main motivation to study three dimensional quantum gravity is to try to
give a precise meaning to the formula (13) in three dimensions. in other words,
we hope that in three dimensions (13) could be well-dened mathematically, and
provide the semiclassical limit (20).
if this is true, then one should be able to
extract from the exact formula for z which are the degrees of freedom giving rise
to the black hole entropy.

the main mathematical device that we shall use is the chern-simons formulation
of three dimensional gravity [5,6]. this formulation makes manifest the fact that
three dimensional gravity does not have any bulk degrees of freedom and it is
renormalizable. still, this does not mean that the problem is trivial because the
relevant group, see below, is sl(2, c) which is not compact. the evaluation of the
partition function for the black hole problem using the chern-simons formulation
was initiated by carlip [44]. some clarication on the boundary conditions and the
role of ensembles can be found in [37]. a string theory approach can be found in
[38]. further developments on the modular properties of the partition function in
three dimensions have recently appeared in [39].

iii

2+1 gravity as a chern-simons theory.

a first order form of the euclidean action

we start with the (palatini) euclidean action for three dimensional gravity with

a negative cosmological constant  = 2/l2,

i[g, 

] =

1

16g z g(cid:18)gr() +

2

l2(cid:19)

(21)

the discovery of achucarro and townsend is that in three dimensions one can
replace the metric by two yang-mills elds such that both the structure of the
action and equations of motion simplies enormously.

this is achieved in various steps. first, we use the palatini formalism. the idea
of this formalism is to note that the ricci tensor r depends on the metric only
through the christoel symbol 
. then, it follows that if one treats g and

 as independent variables in the action (21), the equations of motion yield the
expected relation g; = 0 between the metric and connection. next, we make a
change of coordinates from the coordinate basis  to orthonormal coordinates on
which the metric is at. the matrix that makes this change is called the triad and
is dened by the formula,

g = ea

 ab eb


(22)

clearly, ea
 is dened only up to a (local) lorentz rotation because if  is an element
of the lorentz group then, by denition, 1 = . equation (22) is nothing but

the transformation of a tensor under a change of coordinates described by the
matrix ea
. we also need to transform the christoel symbol which is not a tensor
but we know its transformation law under ea
,
 + e

 = e


aea
,

aa

beb

(23)

where wab
 , known for historical reasons as the spin connection, is the new christof-
fel symbol in the new coordinates. eq. (23) is often written in the literature as
ea
; = 0 where the semicolon denoted full covariant derivative, or as dea
ea

where d denotes covariant derivative in the spin connection. these formulae are,
of course, equivalent to (23). note that in (23) we have only transform two in-
dices. the reason is that the christoel symbol is a 1-form connection for the
dx. the next object we would like to write in the new
group gl(4,), 
coordinates is the curvature tensor. the curvature tensor is a tensorial 2-form, for
that reason we only transform two of its four indices as,

 = 

 = 

where rab = dwab + wa
prove the identity

r

 = e

ae

(24)
c wcb. with formulae (22), (23) and (24) at hand we can

b rab



the relevant steps are (we go from left to right),

z abcrab

rab

ec = z gr
z abcrab
ec = z abc(cid:18)1
(cid:19) ec

2 z  e r
, and  = []

in the second line we have used (24), and in the third line abcea
 = e with
e equal to the determinant of ea
[] (recall that we are working
in the euclidean formalism). it should be clear that the last line in (26) is equal
to the right hand side of (25).

eb

ec

collecting all formulae together we arrive at the new action for three-dimensional

(25)

(26)

(27)

gravity,

i[ea, wab] =

1

16g z abc(cid:18)rab +

1
3l2 ea

eb(cid:19) ec.

the action i[e, w] is equal to the action i[g, ] shown in (21). besides notation
issues there is a conceptual consequence. the action (27) is perfectly well dened
even is the metric is degenerate.
in this sense, the triad formulation provides a
generalization for the einstein-hilbert action.

the last step before we can write the chern-simons action is to dene the new

spin connection3 wa and curvature ra,

3) with this denition of wa the torsion becomes t a = dea + a

bcwb  ec.

with ra = dwa + 1

bcwbc,

wa = (1/2)a
2a

bcwb

wc.

ra = (1/2)a

bcrbc

(28)

we are now ready to make the connection with chern-simons theory. let x be

a complex number and let aa and aa to elds related to e and w by,

aa = wa + xea,

aa = wa  xea.

(29)

the relation between chern-simons theory and three dimensional general relativity
follows from the equality:

2eara +

x2
3

abceaebec =

(aadaa +

2x

abcaaabac)
3
1
( aad aa +
3

abc aa ab ac) + db.

(30)

this relation is true regardless the signature of spacetime or sign of the cosmological
constant. just plug (29) into the right hand side of (30) and obtain the left hand
side. (db is a total derivative term.)

depending on the signature of spacetime and cosmological constant x need to
be complex or real. we shall be interested here in the euclidean gravity with a
negative cosmological constant. in the case, x is purely imaginary.

b chern-simons action

from the equality (30) with x = i/l it follows that the einstein-hilbert action

(21) for euclidean three dimensional gravity can be written in the form,

where i[a] is the chern-simons action,

i[g, ] = ii[a]  ii[ a],

i[a] =

k

4 z tr(ada +

2
3

a3),

at level4,

in (31) we have dened

k = 

l
4g

.

(31)

(32)

(33)

a = aaja,

(34)
4) the sign of k depends on the identity g = e where e is the determinant of the triad. this

sign determines the relative orientation of the coordinate and orthonormal basis. we have chosen
here the plus sign which means that we work with e > 0.

a = aaja.

ab jc, tr(jajb) = (1/2)ab. note that a is not the complex
let f a and f a the yang-mills curvatures associated to aa and aa. from the
point of view of the equations of motion, the relation between chern-simons theory
and general relativity is contained in the fact that the chern-simons equations,

f a = 0,

f a = 0,

(36)

are equivalent to the three-dimensional einstein equations. thus, studying the
space of solutions of (36) we are studying general relativity.

the 1-form aa is a sl(2, c) yang-mills gauge eld because in (29) x is imaginary.
for minkowskian gravity x = 1/l is real and the relevant group is so(2, 1) 
so(2, 1).

c chern-simons dynamics. kac-moody symmetry

once we have proved the equality between the chern-simons and gravitational
actions we can forget about metrics and work with yang-mills elds which are much
more tractable. we should keep in mind however that the chern-simons action
is a generalization to general relativity in the sense that it can accept degenerate
metrics.

the classical dynamics of chern-simons theory is simple to analyse. first, we
in the 2+1
i dxi, the chern-simons action

note that the chern-simons action is already in hamiltonian form.

(37)

the coordinates xi are local coordinates on the spatial surface denoted by . this
action has 2n dynamical elds aa
i (a = 1, ..., n; i = 1, 2) and n lagrange multipli-
ers aa

the equation of motion with respect to a0 leads to the constraint equation,

(38)

(39)

which (after properly taken into account boundary condition and boundary terms
if the spatial surface has a boundary) generates the gauge transformations aa
i =
dia in the poisson bracket (38).

because the equations of motion of chern-simons theory are f = 0 we know
that there are no local degrees of freedom in this theory. it is instructive however
to count the number of degrees of freedom per point using the dirac formalism. we
have 2n dynamical variables subject to n constrains. these constraints are of rst
class and generate the n local gauge transformations. thus the total number of
local degrees of freedom is indeed zero. this does not mean that the action is trivial.
there are an innite number of degrees of freedom associated to the breakdown of
gauge invariance at the boundary, plus a nite number associated to holonomies
along non-contractible loops. here we shall not consider the holonomies. we refer
the reader to [6,22].

the boundary degrees of freedom in chern-simons theory can be understood in
many dierent ways. their existence was rst indicated in [49], and carlip [43,44]
rst pointed out that they may be responsible for the three-dimensional black hole
entropy.

these degrees of freedom are somehow a matter of interpretation rather than
a specic calculation. the point is that, at the boundary, is incorrect to identify
congurations that dier by a gauge transformation. as discussed in [43] this
follows from boundary terms arising in the transformation of the chern-simons
action under gauge transformations. alternatively, following [32], one can see that
i = dia are not generated by constraints
at the boundary the transformations aa
and therefore they do not represent proper gauge transformations. in summary,
the symmetry is still there but its interpretation is dierent.

this point can be exhibited in the following calculation. this analysis is taken
from [50] and [54], with minor modications. to simplify the notation, let us use
dierential form notation in the spatial manifold a = aidxi. we rewrite the action
(37) in the form,

i[a, a0] =

k

4 z dtz

(a a  a0f ),

where the symbol r includes the trace tr. the constraint f = 0 implies,

a = g1dg,

from where we derive two useful identities,

a = d(g1g),

a = d(g1 g).

(40)

(41)

(42)

d represents the covariant derivative in the at connection a given in (41): d =
d + [a, ]. our goal is to compute the commutator of two solutions of the form (41).
consider a non-canonical lagrangian of the form l = la(z) za whose variation

reads

l = zaab zb,

ab(z) = alb  bla.

if  is non-degenerate, the poisson bracket of za with itself is given by

{za, zb} = j ab(z)

(43)

(44)

where j is the inverse of , j abbc = a
c . the jacobi identity for j follows from
the bianchi identity for . if l = p q the above construction yields [q, p] = 1, as
expected. following [54], we shall use this method to compute the poisson bracket
between solutions of the form (41).

the idea is to replace the solution (41) in the action (40) and compute its vari-
ation on the surface (41). since after replacing (41) in (40) only the kinetic term
survives the variation of i reads,

k

k

2 z aa,
i = 
2 z
= 
k
2 z
=

d(g1 g)d(g1g),

d(g1 g) g1g.

(45)

the last equality follows from dd = f = 0. we thus nd that the variation of
i on the surface (41) depends only on the boundary values of g. this is of course
the well known fact that the variation of the w zw action can be written as a
local functional of the boundary. it also means that the only non-trivial degrees of
freedom arise at the boundary, and they are the values of g at the boundary. using
(42), the variation of i can be written as,

i =

k

2 z

a

1
d

a

(46)

where 1/d is the inverse of the operator d =  + [a, ] which we assume exists
(we exclude functions satisfying df = 0). comparing this variation with (43) and
(44), we nd the poisson bracket of a with itself,

{a, a} =

2
k

d

(47)

where the derivative term in d should be understood as the derivative of a dirac
delta function. finally, we make a fourier expansion,

a() =

2

k xn

t a
n ein

and obtain the quantum commutator (h = 1)

[t a

n , t b

m] = iab

ct c

n+m + n

k

(49)

some comments are in order here.
(i) it is clear that the equations of motion do not force a to be zero. ac-
in the sector with chiral boundary conditions a is arbitrary. on the
indeed, let

tually,
other hand, a generates gauge transformations acting on itself.

q() = (k/2)r aaa

, it follows directly from (47) that,

aa

 = [aa

, q] = da.

(50)

however, here the interpretation is quite dierent because (50) is not generated by
the gauss law constraint f = 0. instead, it is generated by a which is dierent
from zero. the symmetry (50) is a global not gauge symmetry. this means
that congurations which dier by a transformation of the form (50) are physically
distinct. this is the origin of boundary degrees of freedom in chern-simons theory.
(ii) we have only computed the bracket between the values of the gauge eld
a, not the group element g. this will be enough for our purposes but we remark
that the problem of computing the bracket of g(x) with itself leads to interesting
constructions which involve quantum groups. another remarkable application of
chern-simons theory which we will not consider here is knot theory [49].

(iii) the algebra (49) is known as ane, or kac-moody, su(2) algebra. this
algebra is a non-abelian generalization of the usual heisenberg algebra [an, am] =
nn+m. note that the last term in (49) is precisely the algebra of three oscillators.
the rst term couples them and, for example, alter the number of degrees of free-
dom (degeneracy). unitary representations for (49) are well understood (see, for
example, [47,58,48]) and they exist provided k is an integer.

(iv) finally, an exercise for interested students: derive (49) starting from (38)
by xing the gauge ar = 0, solving the constraints f = 0 and constructing the
dirac bracket. note that the constraint f = 0 is a dierential equation which on
a manifold with boundary will necessarily lead to an integration function. identify
this function with a above.

iv the brown-henneaux conformal

symmetry

as a nal point, we briey mention one the main application of the ane algebra
(49) to three-dimensional gravity. the content of this section follows the original
papers [7,41] for the derivation of the conformal algebra, [5557] for the su(2)k 
virasoro reduction, and [10,23,45] for the statistical interpretation of the conformal
algebra. see [35,40,59] for other aspects and further developments.

let us show how does the brown-henneaux conformal algebra for anti-de sit-
ter spacetimes is derived from (49). we follow [41]. (see [36] for an alternative
derivation based on a twisted sugawara construction, and [46] for a supersymmet-
ric generalization.)

it was pointed out in [41] that the full ane algebra does not represent the
dynamics of anti-de sitter spacetimes. indeed, computing the metric associated to

the boundary conditions invariant under (49), one discoveres that they match the
boundary conditions found in [7] only if one imposes the additional restrictions [41]

t 3
n = 0,

n = 0
t +
n,

(51)

on the ane generators (t  = t 1  it 2).
these reductions conditions were rst studied in [55] in the context of two-
dimensional gravity. it was shown in that reference that the residual algebra leads
to a virasoro algebra with a central charge c = 6k. starting from (49) this result
can be proved as follows. we regard (51) as a set of second class constraints to
be imposed in the algebra (49). we then construct the dirac5 bracket [ , ] which
n , x] = 0 for all x. the only remaining
is invariant under (51):
component t 
n and it follows that, in the dirac
bracket, ln satises the virasoro algebra

n can be renamed as ln = (1/k)t 

[t 3

n , x] = [t +

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m +

c
12

n(n2  1)n+m

(52)

with central charge c = 6k (see [40] for an explicit calculation). from the value
of k given in (33) we nd,

c =

3l
2g

,

(53)

which is the correct brown-henneaux central charge [7].

the c = 3l/2g virasoro algebra was discovered in 1986 [7]. however only recently
[10] it was pointed out that it plays a central role in the understanding of quantum
three-dimensional black holes. the idea is the following.

the rst input is that the zero modes l0 and l0 of the virasoro algebra are

related to the mass and spin of anti-de sitter spacetime as [7],

ml = l0 + l0 

c
12

,

j = l0  l0.

(54)

for the black hole [9], these two parameters are related to the inner and outer
horizon via,

5) for those not familiar with the dirac bracket formalism, see [53] for a complete treatment.
the idea is to nd the poisson bracket acting on a system with constraints. for example, a free

particle in three dimensions with a canonical kinetic termr pi qi has the standard poisson bracket

structure. suppose we decide to restrict the movement of the particle according to q3 = 0, p3 = 0.
the new poisson bracket is the same as before with the only modication that the coordinates q3
and p3 are removed. there are cases, however, in which the constraints are complicated functions
of the canonical variables and one can not remove the right coordinates just by inspection. let
us consider a system with variables za and a poisson bracket [za, zb] = j ab. now, we impose
the restrictions (z) = 0 such that detc 6= 0 where c = [, ]. the dirac bracket
[ , ] = [ , ] [ , ]c  [, ] is antisymmetric, satises the jacobi identity and is invariant under
the constraints, [x, ] = 0 for all x.

(55)

the virasoro algebra (52) represents a symmetry of the theory, just like the an-
gular momentum algebra, [li, lj] = iijklk, is the symmetry algebra of a rotational
invariant lagrangian. suppose that the algebra (52) is the symmetry algebra as-
sociated to some conformal eld theory which is unitary (l0, l0  0) and modular
invariant. modular invariance implies that the partition function,

satises

z[ ] = tr e2i (l0 c/24)2i ( l0c/24),

z[ ] = z[ ],

  =

a + b
c + d

,

(56)

(57)

for any a, b, c, d  z and ad  bc = 1. the parameter  is the modular parameter,
or complex structure, of the torus on which the cft is dened. we recall that the
partition function (56) has a precise interpretation in the black hole manifold. the
euclidean black hole has the topology of a solid torus whose modular parameter
is given in (19) and l0 + l0 is the hamiltonian of the theory (up to an additive
constant that we discuss below). this is actually implicit in (54).

since z[ ] is modular invariant, we can evaluate z[1/ ] in the limit im( )  0.
assuming l0, l0  0 we obtain,

z[ ]  (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

exp(cid:18)2ic
24 (cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(58)

from (19),  = i/2l (non-rotating case), and (53) we nd exactly the semiclas-
sical gibbons-hawking limit (20). (exercise: generalize this to the rotating case.)
this is the canonical [9,37,38,52] version of the results obtained in [10]. note that
the limit im( )  0 corresponds to small  and, according to (18), large values of
m. this is a characteristic of the three dimensional black hole not shared by the
schwarzschild solution. the temperature in three dimensions decreases with the
mass, the specic heat is positive and the canonical ensemble is well-dened.

a microcanonical calculation follows by writing the partition function (56) in the

form,

z[ ] = xl0, l0

(l0, l0)e2i (l0 c/24)2i ( l0c/24),

(59)

where (l0, l0) is the number of states with eigenvalues l0, l0. using the approx-
imation (58) in (59) one can extract the number of states (l0, l0) by a contour
integral obtaining,

(l0, l0)  e2cl0/6+2cc l0/6.

(60)

this is known as cardy formula.
it is amusing to check that using (53), (54)
and (55), the associated entropy is exactly equal to the bekenstein-hawking value
s = a/4g with a = 2r+ [10].

actually, the above calculation is true provided the black hole mass is large
enough: ml >> c/12 (see (54)). the shift c/12 appearing in (54) (which should
be written as c/24c/24) is the source of a number of issues. for unitary theories,
on which the above calculation makes sense, it means that the mass spectrum is
m  c/12 and thus not only black holes enter in the partition function but
also the conical singularities (particle solutions) introduced in [8]. curiously when
writing canonical expressions for the virasoro generators, either using the liouville
approach [41] or the twisted sugawara operator [36], one nds m  0. this looks
ne because the entropy should be associated to black holes spacetimes having
horizons and not to the particle solutions. however, if one restricts the spectrum to
positive masses, then the saddle point approximation (58) is not valid. in summary,
the cft whose symmetry is generated by (52), and that we assumed existed, does
not seem to be related to general relativity.

we shall end here. see [45,11] for discussions on this last point, [59] for a proposal
to resolve this problem within general relativity, and [11,13,14] for the string theory
side of it.
