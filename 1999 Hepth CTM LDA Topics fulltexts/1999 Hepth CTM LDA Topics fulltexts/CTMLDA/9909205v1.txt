abstract

gravitational collapse of matter trapped on a brane will produce a black hole on the brane. we
discuss such black holes in the models of randall and sundrum where our universe is viewed as
a domain wall in ve dimensional anti-de sitter space. we present evidence that a non-rotating
uncharged black hole on the domain wall is described by a black cigar solution in ve dimensions.

introduction

there has been much recent interest in the idea that our universe may be a brane embedded in some
higher dimensional space. it has been shown that the hierarchy problem can be solved if the higher
dimensional planck scale is low and the extra dimensions large [1, 2]. an alternative solution, proposed
by randall and sundrum (rs), assumes that our universe is a negative tension domain wall separated
from a positive tension wall by a slab of anti-de sitter (ads) space [3]. this does not require a large
extra dimension: the hierarchy problem is solved by the special properties of ads. the drawback with
this model is the necessity of a negative tension object.

in further work [4], rs suggested that it is possible to have an innite extra dimension. in this
model, we live on a positive tension domain wall inside anti-de sitter space. there is a bound state
of the graviton conned to the wall as well as a continuum of kaluza-klein (kk) states. for non-
relativistic processes on the wall, the bound state dominates over the kk states to give an inverse
square law if the ads radius is suciently small. it appears therefore that four dimensional gravity
is recovered on the domain wall. this conclusion was based on perturbative calculations for zero
thickness walls. supergravity domain walls of nite thickness have recently been considered [5, 6, 7]
and a non-perturbative proof that the bound state exists for such walls was given in [8]. it is important
to examine other non-perturbative gravitational eects in this scenario to see whether the predictions
of four dimensional general relativity are recovered on the domain wall.

if matter trapped on a brane undergoes gravitational collapse then a black hole will form. such
a black hole will have a horizon that extends into the dimensions transverse to the brane: it will be
a higher dimensional object. phenomenological properties of such black holes have been discussed in

[9] for models with large extra dimensions. in this paper we discuss black holes in the rs models. a
natural candidate for such a hole is the schwarzschild-ads solution, describing a black hole localized
in the fth dimension. we show in the appendix that it is not possible to intersect such a hole with
a vacuum domain wall so it is unlikely that it could be the nal state of gravitational collapse on the
brane. a second possibility is that what looks like a black hole on the brane is actually a black string
in the higher dimensional space. we give a simple solution describing such a string. the induced
metric on the domain wall is simply schwarzschild, as it has to be if four dimensional general relativity
(and therefore birkhos theorem) are recovered on the wall. this means that the usual astrophysical
properties of black holes (e.g. perihelion precession, light bending etc.) are recovered in this scenario.
we nd that the ads horizon is singular for this black string solution. this is signalled by scalar
curvature invariants diverging if one approaches the horizon along the axis of the string. if one ap-
proaches the horizon in a dierent direction then no scalar curvature invariant diverges. however, in a
frame parallelly propagated along a timelike geodesic, some curvature components do diverge. further-
more, the black string is unstable near the ads horizon - this is the gregory-laamme instability [10].
however, the solution is stable far from the ads horizon. we will argue that our solution evolves to a
black cigar solution describing an object that looks like the black string far from the ads horizon
(so the metric on the domain wall is schwarzschild) but has a horizon that closes o before reaching
the ads horizon. in fact, we conjecture that this black cigar solution is the unique stable vacuum
solution in ve dimensions which describes the endpoint of gravitational collapse on the brane. we
suspect that the ads horizon will be non-singular for the cigar solution.

2 the randall-sundrum models

both models considered by rs use ve dimensional ads. in horospherical coordinates the metric is

ds2 = e2y/lijdxidxj + dy2

(2.1)

where  is the four dimensional minkowski metric and l the ads radius. the global structure of
ads is shown in gure 1. horospherical coordinates break down at the horizon y = .

in their rst model [3], rs slice ads along the horospheres at y = 0 and y = yc > 0, retain the
portion 0 < y < yc and assume z2 reection symmetry at each boundary plane. this gives a jump in
extrinsic curvature at these planes, yielding two domain walls of equal and opposite tension

 = 

6
2l

(2.2)

where 2 = 8g and g is the ve dimensional newton constant. the wall at y = 0 has positive tension
and the wall at y = yc has negative tension. mass scales on the negative tension wall are exponentially
suppressed relative to those on the positive tension one. this provides a solution of the hierarchy
problem provided we live on the negative tension wall. the global structure is shown in gure 1.

the second rs model [4] is obtained from the rst by taking yc  . this makes the negative
tension wall approach the ads horizon, which includes a point at innity. rs say that their model
contains only one wall so presumably the idea is that the negative tension brane is viewed as an auxiliary
device to set up boundary conditions. however, if the geometry makes sense then it should be possible
to discuss it without reference to this limiting procedure involving negative tension objects.
if one
simply slices ads along a positive tension wall at y = 0 and assumes reection symmetry then there
are several ways to analytically continue the solution across the horizon. these have been discussed
in [11, 12]. there are two obvious choices of continuation. the rst is simply to assume that beyond
the horizon, the solution is pure ads with no domain walls present. this is shown in gure 2. an

alternative, which seems closer in spirit to the geometry envisaged by rs, is to include further domain
walls beyond the horizon, as shown in gure 2. in this case, there are innitely many domain walls
present.

3 black string in ads

let us rst rewrite the ads metric 2.1 by introducing the coordinate z = ley/l. the metric is then
manifestly conformally at:

ds2 =

l2
z2 (dz2 + ijdxidxj).

(3.1)

in these coordinates, the horizon lies at z =  while the timelike innity of ads is at z = 0. we
now note that if the minkowski metric within the brackets is replaced by any ricci at metric then
the einstein equations (with negative cosmological constant) are still satised1. a natural choice for

1 this procedure was recently discussed for general p-brane solutions in [13].

3

a metric describing a black hole on a domain wall at xed z is to take this ricci at metric to be the
schwarzschild solution:

ds2 =

l2
z2 (u (r)dt2 + u (r)1dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2) + dz2)

(3.2)

where u (r) = 1  2m/r. this metric describes a black string in ads. including a reection symmetric
domain wall in this spacetime is trivial: surfaces of constant z satisfy the israel equations provided
the domain wall tension satises equation 2.2. for a domain wall at z = z0, introduce the coordinate
w = z  z0. the metric on both sides of the wall can then be written

ds2 =

l2

(|w| + z0)2 (u (r)dt2 + u (r)1dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2) + dw2)

(3.3)

with  < w <  and the wall is at w = 0. it would be straightforward to use the same method to
construct a black string solution in the presence of a thick domain wall.

the induced metric on a domain wall placed at z = z0 can be brought to the standard schwarzschild
form by rescaling the coordinates t and r. the adm mass as measured by an inhabitant of the wall
would be m = m l/z0. the proper radius of the horizon in ve dimensions is 2m. the ads length
radius l is required to be within a few orders of magnitude of the planck length [4] so black holes of
astrophysical mass must have m/z0  1. if one included a second domain wall with negative tension
then the adm mass on that wall would be exponentially suppressed relative to that on the positive
tension wall.

our solution has an einstein metric so the ricci scalar and square of the ricci tensor are nite

everywhere. however the square of the riemann tensor is

rr =

l4  40 +

48m 2z4

r6 ! ,

(3.4)

which diverges at the ads horizon z =  as well as at the black string singularity at r = 0. we shall
have more to say about this later.

it is important to examine the behaviour of geodesics in this spacetime. let u denote the velocity
along a timelike or null geodesic with respect to an ane parameter  (taken to be the proper time in
the case of a timelike geodesic). the killing vectors k = /t and m = / give rise to the conserved
quantities e = k  u and l = m  u. rearranging these gives

for motion in the equatorial plane (  /2). the equation describing motion in the z-direction is
simply

where  = 0 for null geodesics and  = 1 for timelike geodesics. the solutions for null geodesics are

the solution for timelike geodesics is

z = z1cosec(/l).

(3.9)

in both cases, z1 is a constant and we have shifted  so that z   as   0. the (null) solution
z = const is simply a null geodesic of the four dimensional schwarzschild solution. we are more
interested in the other solutions because they appear to reach the singularity at z = . the radial

now introduce a new parameter  = z2

l = z2

which is the radial equation for a timelike geodesic in a four dimensional schwarzschild solution of mass
m [14]. (this is the adm mass for an observer with z = z0 = l2/z1.) note that  is the proper time
along such a geodesic. it should not be surprising that a null geodesic in ve dimensions is equivalent
to a timelike geodesic in four dimensions: the non-trivial motion in the fth dimension gives rise to
a mass in four dimensions. what is perhaps surprising is the relationship between the four and ve
dimensional ane parameters  and .

we are interested in the behaviour near the singularity, i.e. as   0. this is equivalent to
   i.e. we need to study the late time behaviour of four dimensional timelike geodesics. if such
geodesics hit the schwarzschild singularity at r = 0 then they do so at nite . for innite  there
are two possibilities [14]. the rst is that the geodesic reaches r = . the second can occur only
if l2 > 12 m 2, when it is possible to have bound states (i.e. orbits restricted to a nite range of r)
outside the schwarzschild horizon.

the orbits that reach r =  have late time behaviour r  p e2  1 and hence

(3.12)

r

as   0. along such geodesics, the squared riemann tensor does not diverge. the bound state
geodesics behave dierently. these remain at nite r and therefore the square of the riemann tensor
does diverge as   0. they orbit the black string innitely many times before hitting the singularity,
but do so in nite ane parameter.

it appears that some geodesics encounter a curvature singularity at the ads horizon whereas others
might not because scalar curvature invariants do not diverge along them. it is possible that only part
of the surface z =  is singular. to decide whether or not this is true, we turn to a calculation of the
riemann tensor in an orthonormal frame parallelly propagated along a timelike geodesic that reaches
z =  but for which the squared riemann tensor does not diverge (i.e. a non-bound state geodesics).
the tangent vector to such a geodesic (with l = 0) can be written

it is straightforward to check that this is parallelly propagated along the geodesic i.e. u  n = 0.
these two unit vectors can be supplemented by three other parallelly propagated vectors to form an
orthonormal set. however the divergence can be exhibited using just these two vectors. one of the
curvature components in this parallelly propagated frame is

r(u)(n)(u)(n)  runun =

(3.15)

which diverges along the geodesic as   0. the black string solution therefore has a curvature
singularity at the ads horizon.

it is well known that black string solutions in asymptotically at space are unstable to long wave-
length perturbations [10]. a black hole is entropically preferred to a suciently long segment of string.
the strings horizon therefore has a tendency to pinch o and form a line of black holes. one might
think that a similar instability occurs for our solution. however, ads acts like a conning box which
prevents uctuations with wavelengths much greater that l from developing. if an instability occurs
then it must do so at smaller wavelengths.

if the radius of curvature of the strings horizon is suciently small then the ads curvature will be
negligible there and the string will behave as if it were in asymptotically at space. this means that
it will be unstable to perturbations with wavelengths of the order of the horizon radius 2m = 2m l/z.
at suciently large z, such perturbations will t into the ads box, i.e. 2m  l, so an instability can
occur near the ads horizon. however for m/z  1, the potential instability occurs at wavelengths
much greater than l and is therefore not possible in ads. therefore the black string solution is unstable
near the ads horizon but stable far from it.

we conclude that, near the ads horizon, the black string has a tendency to pinch o but further
away it is stable. after pinching o, the string becomes a stable black cigar which would extend to
innity in ads if the domain wall were not present, but not to the ads horizon. the cigars horizon
acts as if it has a tension which balances the force pulling it towards the centre of ads. we showed
above that if our domain wall is at z = z0 then a black hole of astrophysical mass has m/z0  1,
corresponding to the part of the black cigar far from the ads horizon. here, the metric will be well
approximated by the black string metric so the induced metric on the wall will be schwarzschild and
the predictions of four dimensional general relativity will be recovered.

4 discussion

any phenomenologically successful theory in which our universe is viewed as a brane must reproduce
the large-scale predictions of general relativity on the brane. this implies that gravitational collapse of
uncharged non-rotating matter trapped on the brane ultimately settles down to a steady state in which
the induced metric on the brane is schwarzschild. in the higher dimensional theory, such a solution
could be a localized black hole or an extended object intersecting the brane. we have investigated
these alternatives in the models proposed by randall and sundrum (rs). the obvious choice of ve
dimensional solution in the rst case is schwarzschild-ads. however we have shown (in the appendix)
that it is not possible to intersect this with a vacuum domain wall so it cannot be the nal state of
gravitational collapse on the wall.

6

we have presented a solution that describes a black string in ads. it is possible to intersect this
solution with a vacuum domain wall and the induced metric is schwarzschild. the solution can therefore
be interpreted as a black hole on the wall. the ads horizon is singular. scalar curvature invariants only
diverge if this singularity is approached along the axis of the string. however, curvature components
diverge in a frame parallelly propagated along any timelike geodesic that reaches the horizon. this
singularity can be removed if we use the rst rs model in which there are two domain walls present
and we live on a negative tension wall. however if we wish to use the second rs model (with a
non-compact fth dimension) then the singularity will be visible from our domain wall. in [8], it was
argued that anything emerging from a singularity at the ads horizon would be heavily red-shifted
before reaching us and that this might ensure that physics on the wall remains predictable in spite
of the singularity. however we regard singularities as a pathology of the theory since, in principle,
arbitrarily large uctuations can emerge from the singularity and the red-shift is nite.

fortunately, it turns out that our solution is unstable near the ads horizon. we have suggested
that it will decay to a stable conguration resembling a cigar that extends out to innity in ads but
does not reach the ads horizon. the solution becomes nite in extent when the gravitational eect
of the domain wall is included. our domain wall is situated far from the ads horizon so the induced
metric on the wall will be very nearly schwarzschild. since the cigar does not extend as far as the ads
horizon, it does not seem likely that there will be a singularity there. similar behaviour was recently
found in a non-linear treatment of the rs model [8]. it was shown that pp-waves corresponding to
kaluza-klein modes are singular at the ads horizon. these pp-waves are not localized to the domain
wall. the only pp-waves regular at the horizon are the ones corresponding to gravitons conned to
the wall. we suspect that perturbations of the at horospheres of ads that do not vanish near the
horizon will generically give rise to a singularity there.

it seems likely that there are other solutions that give rise to the schwarzschild solution on the
domain wall. for example, the metric outside a star on the wall would be schwarzschild. if the cigar
solution was the only stable solution giving schwarzschild on the wall then it would have to be possible
to intersect it with a non-vacuum domain wall describing such a star. however, it is then not possible
to choose the equation of state for the matter on the wall, for reasons analogous to those discussed in
the appendix. our solution is therefore not capable of describing generic stars. if this is the case then
one might wonder whether there are other solutions describing black holes on the wall. we conjecture
that the cigar solution is the unique stable vacuum solution with a regular ads horizon that describes
a non-rotating uncharged black hole on the domain wall.

the parameter m is related to the mass of the black hole. we have not yet included the gravitational
eect of the wall. we shall focus on the second rs model so we want a single positive tension domain
wall with the spacetime reection symmetric in the wall. denote the spacetime on the two sides of the
wall as (+) and (). let n be a unit (spacelike) normal to the wall pointing out of the (+) region.
the tensor h = g  nn projects vectors onto the wall, and its tangential components give the
induced metric on the wall. the extrinsic curvature of the wall is dened by

and its trace is k = h k . the energy momentum tensor t of the wall is given by varying its
action with respect to the induced metric. the gravitational eect of the domain wall is given by the
israel junction conditions [15], which relate the discontinuity in the extrinsic curvature at the wall to
its energy momentum:

[k  kh ]+

(see [16] for a simple derivation of this equation). here 2 = 8g where g is the ve dimensional
newton constant. this can be rearranged using reection symmetry to give

cylindrical symmetry dictates that we should consider a domain wall with position given by  =

not allow an equation of state to be specied in advance. we are only interested in vacuum solutions
since these describe the nal state of gravitational collapse on the brane.
