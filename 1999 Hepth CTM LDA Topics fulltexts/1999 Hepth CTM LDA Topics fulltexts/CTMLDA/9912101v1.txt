abstract

in this note we point out that a symmetric product orbifold cft can be
twisted by a unique nontrivial two-cocycle of the permutation group. this
discrete torsion changes the spins and statistics of corresponding second-
quantized string theory making it essentially supersymmetric. the long
strings of even length become fermionic (or ghosts), those of odd length
bosonic. the partition function and elliptic genus can be described by a
sum over stringy spin structures. the usual cubic interaction vertex is odd
and nilpotent, so this construction gives rise to a dlcq string theory with a
leading quartic interaction.

1. introduction

symmetric product orbifolds are two-dimensional sigma models on the conguration

space

snx = x n /sn

(1.1)

of n unordened points on a space x. although this is a singular space, since the permuta-
tion group sn does not act free, the corresponding cft is well-behaved. in the last years
these cfts have played an important role in string theory. symmetric products appear
naturally as moduli spaces of supersymmetric gauge theories and world-volume theories
of d-branes, and the corresponding cfts are a crucial ingredient in matrix string theory
[1, 2, 3] and the light-cone gauge quantization of so-called little string theories [4, 5, 6].
(see also [7] for background material on symmetric product models.) in all these applica-
tions one describes second-quantized string theories by considering a single sigma model
with target snx, eectively second-quantizing the spacetime rst.

in this note we want to point out that these orbifold conformal eld theories have a

natural simple generalization. one can include a nontrivial discrete torsion class

h 2(sn , u(1)) = z2

(1.2)

for the action of the permutation group. with this torsion the conguration space becomes
in some mild sense a non-commutative space. the discrete torsion class denes a spin cover
of the permutation group where disjoint elementary transpositions anticommute instead
of commute. we will point out that physically the string theory becomes essentially
supersymmetric, with equal number of bosonic and fermionic strings, where the statistics
are determined by the winding number of the string (with even windings fermionic and
odd winding bosonic).

the plan of this note is as follows. we will rst recall the denition and some inter-
pretations of discrete torsion in orbifold conformal eld theories. then we will apply this
formalism to the symmetric group in section 3, where we explicitely compute the eects
of the two-cocycle (1.2). we then turn to the application in cft and second-quantized
string theory in sections 4 and 5. the partition function, and in particular the elliptic
genus, is described in section 6. we end with some concluding remarks and speculations.

2. discrete torsion

consider an orbifold conformal eld theory that is obtained by quotienting by a nite

group g. then it is well-known that for any non-trivial two-cocycle

c  h 2(g, u(1))

(2.1)

2

in the group cohomology of g we can dene a new model by weighting the twisted sectors
of the orbifold with a non-trivial phase, the so-called discrete torsion [8]. in the case of a
sigma model on a geometric orbifold x/g this discrete torsion can be seen as a particular
choice of a at b-eld  or at gerbe in modern parlance [9]  on the (possibly
singular) target space.

one way to understand discrete torsion is to realize that orbifold quantum eld the-
ories can be considered as discrete gauge theories with gauge group g. in a lagrangian
formulation the partition function of such an orbifold theory on a riemann surface  is
obtained by summing over all possible g bundles over . topologically these bundles are
classied by homotopy classes of maps of  into the classifying space bg, the base space
of the universal g bundle. we can identify the group cohomology h (g) with the usual
cohomology of the classifying space bg. in the path-integral we will sum over all maps

x:   bg,

(2.2)

and in the presence of a discrete torsion class c  h 2(bg, u(1)) we weight the map x by
an extra phase factor [10]

hxc, i  u(1).

(2.3)

alternatively, in a hamiltonian formalism the hilbert space h of the orbifold decom-

poses into sectors as

h =m[g]

hg

(2.4)

here the superselection sectors hg consist of states twisted by g  g and are labeled by
the conjugacy class [g]. the twisted states still carry a residual action of the centralizer
cg, the subgroup consisting of all elements of g that commute with the twist g. normally,
in an orbifold theory one projects in the twisted sector hg on the states invariant under
cg. but, in the presence of discrete torsion the projection picks out the states that
transform as a particular (possibly trivial) one-dimensional representation of cg. this
representation of cg, that we will write as (g, ), is given in terms of the group 2-cocycle
c(g, h) as

(g, h) =

c(g, h)
c(h, g)

,

hg = gh.

(2.5)

one can think of the representation (g, h) geometrically as the phase factor that is associ-
ated to the (at) g bundle on the two-torus t 2 given by the commuting pair of holonomies
(g, h). by this geometric interpretation, or equivalently by the cocycle condition on c, the
above denition of (g, h) is manifest sl(2, z) invariant.

one concrete way to think about this particular one-dimensional representation of
cg is as follows. a two-cocycle or schur multiplier c  h 2(g, u(1)) denes a central

extension bg of g,

1  u(1)  bg  g  1.

3

(2.6)

if g is a nite group, then

z := h 2(g, u(1)) = h 3(g, z)

(2.7)

is a nite abelian group and the central extension can be restricted to a nite extension
by z,

1  z  bg  g  1.

given such a central extension, and a pair of commuting elements g, h in the group g, we

can lift the pair to elements g, h in the covering group bg. now in this central extension

the lifts do no longer necessarily commute, and the commutator of the elements g and
h gives the required one-dimensional representation that takes values in z. that is, we
have

(g, h) = [g, h] = g h g1h1  z.

(2.9)

note that the commutator is independent of the choices of lifts, since these choices dier,
by denition, by a central element, and these central elements cancel out in the commu-
tator.

3. discrete torsion for the symmetric group

let us now consider the case where the nite group g is taken to be the symmetric
group on n elements sn . in this case it is well-known that in the stable range n  4

(2.8)

(3.1)

(3.2)

h 2(sn , u(1)) = z2.

that is, there is a unique non-trivial central extension of the permutation group

1  z2  bsn  sn  1.

(in the case n < 4 this extension by z2 still exists, but it is trivial when considered as an
extension by u(1). for example for n = 2 we get the familiar extension z2  z4  z2.)
geometrically we can think of this double cover as follows. consider the natural action
of sn on an orthonormal basis of the vector space rn . this gives an embedding of sn
into o(n 1), the orthogonal group that acts on the hyperplane that contains the n basis
vectors. the orthogonal group has a unique z2 central extension p in(n  1). restricted
to the rotation group so(n  1) it is the usual spin cover spin(n  1). the restriction
of this spin cover to the symmetric group denes the z2 central extension that we are
looking for.

it should be noted that in parastatistics, where one considers higher-dimensional rep-
resentations of the permutation group, this central extension plays an important role,

4

since it leads to spinor representation of the statistics group, see e.g.
[11]. such repre-
sentations where rst studied by schur, and play an important role in the statistics of
quasiparticles in the pfaan  = 1

2 quantum hall state.

in terms of generators and relations we can dene the spin cover bsn as follows [12, 13].

let us denote the standard generators of sn by ti with i = 1, . . . , n  1. here ti is the
elementary transposition that interchanges the elements i and i + 1. these generators
satisfy the familiar relations

t2
i = 1,

titi+1ti = ti+1titi+1,

titj = tjti,

j > i + 1.

(3.3)

the central extension is obtained by replacing these generators by their lifts ti, adjoining
the central element z with z2 = 1 (we will often write z = 1) and modifying the above
relations to

t2
i = z,

titi+1ti = ti+1titi+1,

titj = z tjti,

j > i + 1.

(3.4)

note that the lift of a transposition has order four, and that two transpositions that
act disjunctly anticommute. that is because in the spin extension these operations,
which are geometrically (weyl) reections, are represented by dirac matrices and therefore
anticommute instead of commute. indeed this last fact is responsible for the non-trivial
two-cocycle of sn . it comes from the z2  z2 subgroup that is generated by interchanging
particles 1 and 2 and particles 3 and 4. these generators now satisfy

t1  t3 = t3  t1.

(3.5)

the discrete torsion of the symmetric group is therefore simply the lift of the group cocycle
(so familiar to string theorists) that generates

h 2(z2  z2, u(1)) = z2.

(3.6)

this also explain why the discrete torsion only appears for n  4.

using these generators and relations it is now completely straightforward to compute
explicitly the phases (g, h) in the twisted sectors. here we should keep in mind that any
element g  sn is conjugate to a product of cyclic permutations, that can be labeled by
a partition of n

[g] = (1)n1(2)n2    , xn1

5

nnn = n.

(3.7)

the centralizer of such an element g is given by

cg

=yn1

snn

 znn
n

since (g, h) is a representation of cg, it satises

(g, h1h2) = (g, h1)(g, h2).

(3.8)

(3.9)

therefore it suces to compute the phases (g, h) for the two specic kinds of elements
h that together generate cg:

(1) a generator of the cyclic group zn of order n;
(2) an elementary transposition in snn that permutes two of those cycles of length n.

we will see that the analysis (and the answer) depends critically on the overall signa-

ture or parity |g| = 0, 1 (mod 2) of the element g, that we note can be written as

|g| =xn1

(n  1)nn (mod 2).

(3.10)

for example, since we have the fundamental result that for |i  j| > 1

(ti, tj) = [ti, tj] = 1,

(3.11)

we will often use the fact that, if two elements g and h act disjunctly, they either commute

or they anticommute in the extension bsn , depending on their signs,

(g, h) = (1)|g||h|.

(3.12)

case (1). let us rst consider a sector twisted by an element g that contains a cycle
of length n. denote the generator of that cycle k, with kn = e. so we can write g = k  g
where g commutes with k. since g and k act disjunctly we can conclude that

(g, k) = (1)|g||k|,

and, because (g, k) = (g, k), we therefore nd

(g, k) =( 1,

n odd,

(1)|g|1, n even.

6

(3.13)

(3.14)

we will give an interpretation of this result later.

case (2). let us now consider a permutation xn that interchanges two disjoint cycles
of equal length n  2 in g. we denote the generators of these two cyclic group as k
and k and write k = k  k. we rst compute the phase (xn, k). the only non-trivial
computation is actually the case n = 2, since we will see that the general case follows
directly from this.

in the case n = 2 we can choose k = t1 and k = t3. the exchange operator x2

satises by denition

and can be written as

x2  t1 = t3  x2,

x2 = t2t1t3t2.

with some simple algebra one now nds with k = t1t3

k  x2 = t1t3t2t1t3t2 = t3t1t2t1t3t2

= t3t2t1t2t3t2 = t3t2t1t3t2t2

= t3t2t3t1t2t2 = t2t3t2t1t2t2
= t2t3t1t2t1t2 = t2t1t3t2t1t2 = x2  k,

so that

(x2, k) = 1.

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

since g can be written as g = g  k, where g acts disjunctly from x2, and since x2 has
even parity, we nd

(x2, g) = (x2, k) = 1.

(3.19)

this result can be formulated as that with discrete torsion two cycles of length 2 anti-
commute instead of commute.

in the general case, where we consider an exchange of two cycles of length n  2, we
simply should observe that the element xn has conjugacy class (2)n. the element k acts
by a cyclic permutation of length n on these n two-cycles. that is, k is a product of
n  1 elements that each exchange a pair of two-cycles and therefore are conjugated to
x2. therefore we nd

(xn, g) = (xn, k) = (1)n1.

(3.20)

this has a straightforward interpretation. when we exchange two n-cycles we obtain an
extra minus sign if n is even. so n-cycles behave as bosons if n is odd, and as fermions
if n is even.

4. the cft interpretation

we will now apply the above computations to determine the eect of discrete torsion

on the symmetric product orbifold conformal eld theory.

4.1. symmetric product orbifolds

suppose we start with a conformal eld theory x with hilbert space h = h(x).
we want to determine the hilbert space of the symmetric orbifold snx = x n /sn . in
the case without discrete torsion the answer has been determined in [14]. (see also [15]
for details about the chiral structure such as fusion rules, modular transformations and
braiding matrices of rational permutation orbifold cfts.)

the answer is most elegantly formulated if one considers the direct sum of all sym-
metric products snx summed over n. then the resulting hilbert space has the structure
of a fock space, generated by an innite set of hilbert spaces hn, n  1, based on the
target space x.

more precisely, if we use the formal generating space of symmetric powers with dummy

variable p

sph =xn 0

xn 0

pn h(snx) =on>0

pn sn h,

(4.1)

(and similarlyvph for the generating space of exterior powers), then we have the result

spnhn(x),

(4.2)

where the hilbert spaces hn(x) are dened as the subspace of h(x) satisfying

l0  l0 = 0 (mod n).

(4.3)

the hilbert spaces hn carry redened hamiltonians l(n)
states generally as long strings [16] of length n.

0 = l0/n. one refers to these

note that the sector hg of the orbifold snx twisted by a group element g of conjugacy

class

corresponds to the summand

in the above expression.

(n)nn

[g] =yn1
on1

snnhn

8

(4.4)

(4.5)

in all these formulas it should be remembered that our starting point is an action of
the symmetric group on sn h. here we have some freedom in how we want sn to act.
in general, the space h will be graded and the corresponding action of sn will respect
this gradation. that is, it will act in the appropriate way by symmetrization or anti-
symmetrization on the even or odd parts. for example if h is the hilbert space of a
free fermion, it will be z2 graded by the fermion number. all actions of the permutation
group are always assumed to be in this graded sense.

4.2. symmetric products with torsion

let us now see how these formulas are changed if one includes discrete torsion. first
of all we have to distinguish between twisted sectors related to n-cycles with n odd and
even. according to our formula (3.20) the statistics of these sectors is now commuting or
anticommuting depending on whether n is odd or even. we will refer to these states as
bosons and fermions. the fermion number f (mod 2) of a twisted state simply equals
the sign of the corresponding cyclic permutation. the total parity |g| of the twisted
sector g thus reects the total fermion number of the state. note that this combinatorial
fermion number should be added to the fermion number that might already be present in
the gradation of the one-string hilbert space h(x).

secondly, for a sector corresponding to a n-cycle we also have to implement the zn
projection. as we have seen, in the case without discrete torsion invariance under the
action of this zn subgroup changes the conventional level matching condition. instead
of the requirement that the spin l0  l0 is integer, one now restricts to the modied
condition that in the hilbert space hn the spin is an n-fold as in (4.3).

with discrete torsion turned on, formula (3.14) tells us that we have to project dif-
ferently in the case that n is even and (1)|g| = 1. in that case we no longer require
invariance under zn but instead only keep the states in the sign representation where
the generator of zn is represented as 1. so the new level matching condition gives the
following quantization for the spin m of strings of even length n:

m := l(n)

0  l

(n)
0 =

1
n

(l0  l0)  z + 1
2 .

(4.6)

that is, in the orbifold cft the fermionic states of even length n will have half-integer
spin. since l0  l0 is always an integer, this condition clearly only makes sense for n
even. note that the overall spin of this state is still integer, because we only apply this
construction in the case that the total fermion number is even. we will denote quite
generally as h
n the subspaces of hn of (half)integer spin, i.e., the subspaces consisting
of states that satisfy (1)2m = 1.

adding everything together the hilbert space of the symmetric product orbifold snx

9

with the nontrivial 2-cocycle c  h 2(sn , u(1)) takes the following form

sp2n1h+

2n1 vp2nh

2n

hc(snx) = meven {nn}
p nnn=n on>0
modd {nn}
p nnn=n on>0

sp2n1h+

2n1 vp2nh+

2n

(4.7)

here a partition {nn} is called even or odd depending on the parity |g| of the correspond-
ing permutation.

5. second-quantized strings

let us make some remarks on the physical interpretation of this result in string theory.
of course the most obvious eect is that the discrete torsion has changed the statistics
of the strings. the long strings of even length have turned into fermions, while the
strings of odd length are still bosons. since we roughly have as many bosons as fermions
the model looks supersymmetric, although, as we will point out, it is perhaps better to
refer to ghosts instead of fermions. the second, more subtle eect of discrete torsion is
its inuence on the quantization of the spins of the fermionic strings. this interpretation
is made more precise in terms of the light-cone quantization formalism.

5.1. interpretation in dlcq

recall that permutation orbifold cfts on the conguration space snx appear natu-

rally in the description of second-quantized strings theories on

x  r1,1

(5.1)

in light-cone gauge, where the longtudinal momentum p+ is discretized, the so-called
discrete light-come quantization or dlcq. in this quantization scheme the null coordinate
x+ is used to describe the time evolution of the system, whereas the null coordinate x,
that is canonically conjugated to p+, is assumed to be periodic. this interpretation of
the symmetric product orbifold is used in the matrix string interpretation of the ten-
dimensional type iia string and in the six-dimensional little string theories related to
coinciding vebranes. (see also [17] for a review of little string theories.)

in this interpretation the quantum number n, the length of the string, is proportional

to the discrete momentum p+. in fact, for our purposes it is best to identify it as

p+ =

n
2

10

(5.2)

we want to think of the states with p+ integer or half-integer as elds that are periodic
or anti-periodic around the compact direction x. this is a well-known setup for the
best-known example of a dlcq eld theory: a chiral conformal eld theory in 1 + 1
dimensions. here the momentum p+ is simply the eigenvalue of the operator l0 (not to
be confused with the world-sheet l0 used above) and we know that for fermionic eld this
eigenvalue will be half-integer in the ns spin structure and integer in the r spin structure.
however, something strange is going on here. according to our computation it is
the states with p+ integer that have turned into fermions, whereas the bosons have half-
integer p+ respectively. since it is the bosons that are sensitive to the spin structure
and get naturally anti-periodic boundary conditions, we see that from this point of view
we are actually dealing with elds that are more appropriately called ghosts, since the
usual relation between spin and statistics is not satised. because of the clash with the
spin-statistics theorem two bosons can decay into a fermion etc.

to understand the second eect of discrete torsion we should remember that strings
in dlcq carry two natural quantum numbers: the longitudinal momentum p+ = n/2
discussed above together with a longitudinal winding number w, an integer that measures
the number of times a string is wrapped around the compactied x direction. in light-
cone gauge the coordinate x is expressed in terms of the world-sheet stress-tensor as

x =

1
p+ t (z).

therefore the winding number is given by

w =

1

2i dx =

1
p+ (l0  l0) = 2m,

(5.3)

(5.4)

with m the conformal eld theory spin. we have seen that m can be half-integer, so w
can be even or odd. but the combination

p+w = l0  l0 = nm

(5.5)

is always integer, as is required by level-matching.

so in the presence of discrete torsion the fermionic strings, with n even, can have
dierent excitations depending on whether the total fermion number is even or odd. if the
total fermion number is even, these fermionic strings have half-integer spin excitations,
or equivalently odd winding numbers.
if the total fermion number is odd, all winding
numbers are even, as is always the case for the bosonic strings.

this interpretation is still not very satisfying nor intuitive, so we will now turn to the

dual picture obtained by performing a t-duality.

11

5.2. t-duality and stringy spin structures

there is an interesting point concerning t-duality in the null direction x. such a
duality will interchange the momentum p+ and the winding number w, or equivalently
the quantum numbers n and m. in the case without torsion this is a manifest symmetry
of the second-quantized theory. (in order to make this a full symmetry one has to add
the p+ = 0 sector, which is always problematic in light-cone quantization. see also the
discussion in [18].) this symmetry between momentum and winding modes seems to be
broken in the presence of the discrete torsion, since it is momentum p+ that determines
the statistics of the strings.

in fact, the complete physical interpretation becomes more conventional if we work in

this t-dual framework. if we interchange (to be precise) p+ and w/2, we have

w = n,

p+ = m,

(5.6)

and strings that are wrapped an even number of times are fermions, and those that
are wrapped an odd number of times are bosons. it would be obvious to assume that
unwrapped strings with n = 0 are also fermionic, although they do not appear explicitly
in this dlcq scheme.

since we have fermionic elds, one can think of making a spin projection of the model,
by summing over all spin structures along the x direction and projecting on even fermion
number  a procedure implemented by summing over spin structures in the time direction
x+. this would be the spacetime equivalent of the familiar procedure in two dimensional
cft, where the sum over spin structures produces out of a fermionic non-local model
a bosonic local model. however, introducing spacetime spin structures in string theory
introduces an extra complication, because fermions can also carry winding numbers.

indeed, consider the general situation of a string on a spacetime that contains a s1,
say for convenience of radius one. on this circle we have momenta p  z and winding
numbers w  z. level-matching of the cft will always require that

p  w  z.

(5.7)

consider now a (spacetime) fermion mode of the string. we have to pick a spin structure
on the circle that determines the boundary conditions for such a eld. there are two
choices: the anti-periodic (neveu-schwarz) spin structure that gives p  z + 1
2 and the
periodic (ramond) spin structure that quantizes the momentum as p  z.

however, if the string also carries a winding number w the story gets a bit more
complicated. for half-integer p we cannot allow arbitrary integer winding number, since
level-matching requires p  w to be integer. so we see that only string states with even
winding number can be fermions. this is the eect we have been observing in this note:
fermion statistics is only consistent for strings of even length. only they can naturally be
anti-periodic.

see also the closely related discussion in [19].

12

now that we have seen that the even windings can couple to a spin structure, it is
naturally to sum over spin structures, both in the compactied space direction (which
might be null, as in dlcq) as in the time direction. the latter procedure has the
familiar interpretation as a projection on even fermion number. in the ns sector, where
p is half-integer quantized and where there is a unique ground state, this implies that
the total parity |g| should be even. this eect we have seen. only for |g| even could
we have half-integer m. in the r sector the spin projection is ambiguous, because of the
assignment of fermion number to the ground state. according to our formulas we should
assign to the ground state odd fermion number, since we require that the total parity |g|
is odd in this case.

6. the elliptic genus

it is interesting to translate these considerations into a concrete formula for the genus
one partition function for the orbifold theory including the eect of the discrete torsion.
this formula becomes particularly simple if we restrict to the chiral partition function,
the so-called elliptic genus which for calabi-yau sigma models with (at least) n = 2
supersymmetry is dened as the following character in the rr sector

(x; q, y) = tr

hrr(cid:2)(1)f yflql0 c
24(cid:3)

given the fourier expansion

(x; q, y) =xm,

c(m, )qmy

(6.1)

(6.2)

of the chiral partition function of the sigma model on x, the generating function of the
elliptic genera of the symmetric products is

z(p, q, y) =xn 0

pn (snx; q, y) = yn>0, m,

(1  pnqmy)c(nm,)

(6.3)

as we have sketched in the previous section, the partition function (and therefore also
the elliptic genus) for the orbifold with discrete torsion is best written as a sum over
spacetime spin structures

z(p, q, y) =

1
2

(z++ + z+ + z+ + z) .

(6.4)

13

here the contributions of the four spin structures are

z++(p, q, y) = yn>0, m
z+(p, q, y) = yn>0, m
z+(p, q, y) = yn>0, m
z(p, q, y) =  yn>0, m

2 y(cid:17)c(n(2m1),)
(cid:16)1 + p2nqm 1
(cid:16)1  p2n1qmy(cid:17)c((2n1)m,)
(cid:16)1  p2nqm 1
2 y(cid:17)c(n(2m1),)
(cid:16)1  p2n1qmy(cid:17)c((2n1)m,)
(cid:16)1 + p2nqmy(cid:17)c(2nm,)
(cid:16)1  p2n1qmy(cid:17)c((2n1)m,)
(cid:16)1  p2nqmy(cid:17)c(2nm,)
(cid:16)1  p2n1qmy(cid:17)c((2n1)m,)

in the case with zero discrete torsion, after a so-called automorphic correction that
adds in the p+ = 0 sector and the shift in the ground state energy, the partition function
takes the form

(1  pnqmy)c(nm,).

(6.6)

(6.5)

(p, q, y) = (pq)/24 yn,m,0

the innite product  will be typically an automorphic form of the t-duality group
so(2, 3, z) = sp(4, z) [20, 21, 18, 22, 23]. this is an example of the famous lifting of a
modular form to an automorphic product as discussed by borcherds [24].

it would be interesting to investigate the automorphic properties of the innite prod-
ucts that are obtained by including the eect of discrete torsion. only for a given spin
structure the partition function can be computed as a one loop amplitude with target
space

x  t 2

(6.7)

as in [20]. so automorphicity, which is simply the t-duality associated to the light-cone
torus t 2, is not as straightforward to check. notice in this respect that the proper t-
duality that interchanges p and q seems to be dierently realized in this fermionic model.
for example, the partition function z+ transforms under the transformation p  q
2 as

1

log z+(q

1

2 , p2, y) =  log z+(p, q, y)

(6.8)

which suggests that we have some nontrivial multiplier for the free energy log z. it would
also be interesting to know if these second-quantized elliptic genera are naturally related
to characters of super-lie algebras.

if we put y = 1 only ground states states with l0 = c/24 contribute, and the elliptic
genus degerates to the euler number or witten index. for the symmetric product this
gives the well-known identity [25, 26, 27, 7]

xn 0

pn (snx) =yn>0

(1  pn)c

(6.9)

with c = (x) the euler number of x. this is almost a modular form for the sl(2, z)
action on , with p = e2i. with discrete torsion only the congurations with no or an
odd number of strings of even length contribute, so we get instead the expression

(1  p2n1)c"1 + 1
yn>0
2yn>0

(1  p2n)c#

2yn>0

(1 + p2n)c  1

(6.10)

no obvious modular properties remain.

7. concluding remarks

matrix string theory can be seen as a dlcq version of string eld theory. it describes
perturbative string theory by conformal perturbation theory around the orbifold cft
sn r8, where the leading irrelevant operator can be identied with the mandelstam cubic
string vertex [3]. if we twist the cft with our discrete torsion we obtain a model with
exotic statistics. in the large n limit the momentum p+ = n/2 is send to innity, keeping
the ratio p+/n nite and making it a continuous variable. the distinction between even
and odd n disappears, and one gets truly equal number of bosons and fermions.

however, a cubic string vertex, which is realized as a z2 twist eld, now has fermionic
statistics. that is, the standard string coupling constant gs becomes a nilpotent grass-
mann variable that squares to zero

g2
s = 0,

(7.1)

a rather mystifying phenomenon. because this cubic vertex is itself fermionic, it mediates
interactions where two fermionic strings (say of length 2) can combine to another fermionic
string (of length 4).

the next to leading order perturbation is a z3 twist eld. this represents in string
perturbation a quartic contact term. its couping constant (which in the conventional setup
is proportional to g2

s) remains bosonic and is now the leading irrelevant deformation.

the inclusion of discrete torsion is also interesting in the case of the so-called d1-
d5 system in type iib string theory compactied on a four-torus or k3 manifold x.
such a d1-d5-brane represents a string in the remaining six uncompactied dimensions.
the infrared limit of the world-sheet theory gives rise to a n = (4, 4) scft on the

15

moduli space of instantons on x. the central charge is given by c = 6k with k = q1q5,
the product of the number of d1-branes and d5-branes. the number of real marginal
deformations of this scft is 4  5 or 4  21 for x = t 4 or k3 respectively.

for certain values of the space-time moduli this hyperkahler moduli space coincides
with the symmetric product snx [5, 28]. in these points the addition of discrete torsion
gives a dierent component of the moduli space of n = (4, 4) scft. the marginal
deformation away from the symmetric product is a z2 twist eld. discrete torsion removes
this marginal operator. the singularities get frozen in. this component of the c = 6k
n = (4, 4) scft moduli space is therefore described just by the moduli of x.
in
particular there is no way to deform the model to a regime where the weakly coupled
supergravity approximation of the dual formulation as string theory on ads3  s3  x
makes sense.

one of the striking properties of the relation between space-time physics and the d1-d5
cft is that the elusive ramond-ramond gauge elds appear as more traditional b-elds
in the sigma model. since we are discussing here a discrete b-eld on the symmetric
product, the spacetime interpretation would seem to be some new discrete rr ux in the
ads3  s3  x string theory. it would be very interesting to identify directly this rr
ux.

for orbifold cft with gauge group g there are natural interpretations of the coho-
mology groups h i(g, u(1)) for i = 1, 2, 3. the group h 1(g) labels the one-dimensional
representations and can be used to twist the original g action. for the permutation group
we have h 1(sn ) = z2 and this just means that we can choose the short strings to be
either fermionic or bosonic.

we have discussed at length the eect of h 2(sn ), how it eects the statistics of the
long strings. so this leaves the possible interpretation of the cohomology group h 3(sn ).
for a general orbifold it classies the possible chiral structures of the cft. alteratively,
it gives the possible three-dimensional topological discrete chern-simons gauge theories
with gauge group sn [10]. it is an interesting fact that for the symmetric group there is
a well-known factor

z24  h 3(sn , u(1)).

(7.2)

as far as i understood, this occurrence of the number 24 is directly related to the famous
c/24 in cft, the framing ambiguity in three-manifold invariants, and the euler number of
k3. it would be fascinating to know if it has any application in terms of second-quantized
strings.
