i. introduction.

this paper is an additional step in our exploration of the gauge invariant variational

approach suggested in [1]. this approach was developed as an attempt to study analyti-

cally the nonperturbative infrared dynamics of nonabelian gauge theory. the idea is that

keeping gauge invariance exact at all stages of the calculation may be crucial for consis-

tent understanding of the ground state structure of qcd. one therefore tries to account

for the generation of nonperturbative qcd condensates by introducing them as variational

parameters in the explicitly gauge invariant (gaussian like) trial wave functional.

so far this variational approach has been applied to pure gluodynamics. there it seems to

capture many of the essential features; mass generation, formation of the gluon condensate,

[1], and asymptotic freedom, [24]. instanton transitions have been analyzed in [5] and are

identied with the saddle points in the integration over the gauge group which projects the

gaussian wave functional onto the gauge invariant physical hilbert space. interestingly we

found that in the best variational state instantons of large size are suppressed and the large

size instanton problem that arises in the standard wkb calculation is completely avoided.

the dynamically generated mass present in the best variational state stabilizes instantons

at a size   1/m.

although there remain many open questions regarding the reliability of these calcula-

tions, it is interesting to see how a simple ansatz of the same type would do in a theory

with fermions. in particular one would like to see whether including fermions leads within

the gauge invariant variational framework to the generation of fermionic condensates and

chiral symmetry breaking.

as a rst step towards this goal, in this paper we will study the simple toy model,

1+1 dimensional abelian theory with massless fermions, the so-called schwinger model [6].

our aim is not to further the understanding of the model itself (which has been solved

exactly many times by dierent methods and is well understood) but to develop a workable

generalization of our method to fermionic theory and test it in the simplest possible but

2

nontrivial setting.

one of the most striking similarities between the schwinger model and qcd is that in

neither theory are the asymptotic states represented by the elds of the lagrangian. the

schwinger model, with massless fermions, exhibits complete screening of charges and has
one neutral asymptotic state; a meson of mass e/. the presence and interconnectedness

of the axial anomaly, instantons and the massive asymptotic states of the theory has made

the schwinger model a rich eld of study.

the outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2 we generalize the gauge invariant

gaussian variational ansatz to include fermions and perform the variational calculation. we

nd that the best variational state in the fermionic sector does not contain new nontrivial

structure. in section 3 we cross check our calculation using the bosonized form of the model.

we nd that our best trial state is in fact the exact ground state of the theory. in section

4 we conclude by calculating the fermionic condensate. we recover the correct value of

the condensate and show thereby that the chiral anomaly is correctly represented in our

calculation.

ii. variational calculation in the schwinger model.

the lagrangian density for the schwinger model reads

l =

1
4

ff  +   (i  ea) .

(1)

the theory is super-renormalizable and the coupling constant, e, has mass dimension +1.
the 2  2 dirac matrices obey the usual anti-commutation relation, {, } = 2g, where
spatial indices run from 0 to 1 and g00 = 1 we write the schwinger model in the hamiltonian

formalism in the temporal gauge, a0 = 0. this leaves one degree of freedom for the photon

eld and all spatial indices are now suppressed; a1(x) = a(x) and 1 = . the hamiltonian

is,

h =z dx (cid:18)1

2

e 2(x) + (x)(i  ea(x))1(x)(cid:19) ,

(2)

3

with the usual canonical relations,

[a(x), e(y)] = i(x  y),
[(x), (y)] = i(x  y),

e(x) = a(x),

(x) = i(x).

(3)

the gauge invariance of a physical state, in this case the vacuum wavefunctional, is ensured

by requiring that it satises gauss law,

g(x)[a, ] =(cid:2)e(x)  e(x)(x)(cid:3) [a, ] = 0.

(4)

as an ansatz for the vacuum wave functional of the theory we take the product of the

vacuum wavefunctionals in the gauge and fermion sectors, projected onto the gauge invariant

subspace. following [1] for the functional in the gauge sector we take a gaussian with an

arbitrary width g(p) which is to be treated as a functional variational parameter.

next we have to address the ansatz in the fermion sector. since we may expect that the

eects of chiral symmetry breaking show up in the fermion sector as dynamical generation

of mass, we propose as an ansatz for the ground state a dirac vacuum of free massive

fermions, which we denote by |mi. the mass, or rather the mass function m(p), can depend
on momentum and is to be treated as an additional variational function. in the absence

of the gauge elds the fermionic operators that annihilate this state are related to the

original fermionic operators by the well known bogolyubov transformation. the state itself

is somewhat similar to the bcs state. the important dierence is that the mixing is not

between particles and antiparticles, but rather between left- and right- moving particles,

so that the possible condensates in this state preserve the charge symmetry but break the

chiral symmetry instead.

the product of the gauge and fermionic vacua is

[a, ] = exp(cid:18)

1

2z dx dy a(x)g1(x  y)a(y)(cid:19)|mi .

(5)

the vacuum wavefunctional in the gauge theory must of course be gauge invariant. this is

achieved by projecting (5) onto the gauge invariant hilbert space. to do this note that (5)

transforms under the gauge transformation generated by gauss law as

4

[a, ] = exp(cid:18)iz dx (x)g(x)(cid:19) [a, ]

= exp(cid:18)

1

2z dx dy a(x)g1(x  y)a(y)(cid:19) exp(cid:18)iez dx (x)(x)(x)(cid:19)|mi .

where,

a(x) = a(x)  (x) ,

(6)

and  is the gauge function. the gauge invariant ansatz for the vacuum wavefunctional is

therefore written by integrating  over all possible gauge transformations,

[a, ] =z d exp(cid:18)

1

2z dx dy a(x)g1(x  y)a(y)(cid:19)

 exp(cid:18)iez dx (x)(x)(x)(cid:19) |mi .

(7)

in this formalism, one calculates expectation values of local operators with the ansatz

for the ground state. since we are interested in the calculation of physical quantities the

operators we shall consider are gauge invariant. the expectation of any such operator o

can be written as

ho(a, , )i =

1

1

z z d dahm| exp(cid:18)
o(a, , ) exp(cid:18)
 exp(cid:18)iez dx (x)(x)(x)(cid:19) |mi .

2z dx dy a(x)g1(x  y)a(y)(cid:19)
2z dx dy a(x)g1(x  y)a(y)(cid:19)

1

first let us consider the norm of the state, o = 1. we rst integrate over a,

z = zaz d exp(cid:18)

1

4z dx dy (x)g1(x  y)(y)(cid:19)

hm| exp(cid:18)iez dx (x)(x)(x)(cid:19) |mi ,

za = det1/2(2 g1) .

(8)

(9)

(10)

the integration over the fermions is a little less straightforward. remembering that |mi is
the vacuum of a free fermionic hamiltonian with mass m one can use the standard trick to

5

fig. 1. shows the quadratic term resulting from the expansion in small e . solid lines rep-

resent a fermion loop and the dashed lines represent the gauge parameter. associated with each

vertex is the factor ie 0(t).

express the fermionic matrix element as a path integral. the gauge transformation operator

in such a representation then has to be understood as an insertion at xed time. this

insertion generates an interaction between the fermions and the gauge parameter,

hm| exp(cid:18)iez dx (x)(x)(x)(cid:19)|mi =
z d  d exp(cid:20)i sf  iez dt dx (t)(x) (x)0(x)(cid:21) ,

where sf is the action for free fermions with momentum dependent mass,

sf =z dt dx dy (x, t) [i(x  y)  m(x  y)] (y, t) .

(11)

(12)

in the subsequent calculation we will treat e  as small and expand to second order

the logarithm in the exponential of the norm produced by integrating over  and . this

results in a series of diagrams. the leading order is independent of  and contributes a

constant factor to the norm which will cancel. represented by fig. 1, the term quadratic

in  contains a fermion loop and is written,



where the equal time propagators are,

e2

2 z dx dy (x)(y)tr(cid:2)0d+(x  y)0d(y  x)(cid:3) ,

d(k) = 

1

2(cid:20)0 

k1 + m(k)

e(k)

(cid:21) ,

(13)

(14)

and e 2(k) = k2 + m2(k). we will see later that keeping only second order terms in e  is

sucient to locate the best variational state. the contribution to the norm from fermion

integration is,

6

hm| exp(cid:18)iez dx (x)(x)(x)(cid:19)|mi =
const.  exp(cid:18)

4 z dx dy (x) x(x  y) (y) + o(cid:0)(e)3(cid:1)(cid:19) ,

e2

where,

x(k) = k2z dp

2(cid:18)1 

p(p  k) + m(p)m(p  k)

e(p)e(p  k)

(cid:19) .

(15)

(16)

the norm then can be written as z = zazz, where za and z are constants which cancel

in all calculations and

z =z d exp(cid:18)

1

4z dx dy (x) s(x  y) (y)(cid:19) .

the eective action for  is given by

s(k) = g1(k) +

e2


x(k) .

(17)

(18)

we now compute the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the variational state. min-

imization of this quantity with respect to the variational parameters will yield the ground

state of the theory. in doing so one should be careful with properly regularizing the ultra-

violet singular operators that enter the hamiltonian,

h(x) =

1
2

e 2(x) + i (x)1 ( + iea(x)) (x) .

(19)

the term to keep an eye on is the interaction term.

in particular the current j(x) =

(x)(x) has to be regularized using the point-splitting technique [7]. this point-splitting

generates an additional term in the hamiltonian which is quadratic in a [7,8],

i d = 

2
2

+ i :  : e a : 1 : 

e2
2

a2 +

ie
2

a ,

(20)

where  is the uv cuto. the rst term is a constant and it does not aect our calculation.

the last term is a total derivative and for this reason will also be dropped. we are therefore

concerned with the calculation of the expectation of the regularized hamiltonian,

h =z dx(cid:18)1

2

e 2(x)+ : i (x)1(x) : +e a(x) : (x)1(x) : +

e2
2

a2(x)(cid:19) .

(21)

7

we proceed to calculate the expectation of (21) in the manner outlined above for the calcu-

lation of the norm. we nd,

h

functional variation of the expectation of the hamiltonian with respect to the parameters

m(p) and g1(p) yields two minimization equations,

x(p)g(p)(cid:21) = 0 .

(26)

(27)

since x/m  m, the rst equation is solved for m(p) = 0. the second minimization
equation has the solution

(cid:18) e2



g(p) + x1(p)(cid:19)2

=

e2


+ x2(p) ,

(28)

where x(p) is dened in (16). with m(p) = 0 we have x(p) = 1/|p|, and we can write the
solution as,

(cid:18)e2



g(p) + |p|(cid:19)2

=

e2


+ p2 .

(29)

summarizing, the result of our variational calculation is the vacuum wavefunctional (5) with

the parameters

m(p) = 0 ,

g(p) =



e2  r e2



+ p2  |p|! .

(30)

the calculations in this section rely upon the perturbative expansion of the eective action

for  in (15). to improve on this we would have to resum this expansion. however, for

8

m(q) = 0 such a re-summation is trivial. it can be shown explicitly that all diagrams higher

than second order vanish and therefore our result is exact at least in the sense that the

solution we found is at least a local minimum. we will see in the next section that the result

is indeed exact.

iii. bosonized formulation of the schwinger model.

as is well known the schwinger model is exactly solvable by the bosonisation technique

[9]. in this section we will discuss the variational calculation in this bosonized form. we

shall show that the solution obtained by the variational method in the bosonized form is

exact. further, we shall show that this solution is equivalent to the wavefunctional obtained

in the previous section constructed in the fermionic hilbert space.

the bosonized form of the hamiltonian density in the temporal gauge (a0 = 0) reads,

h(x) =

1
2

e 2(x) +

1

2(cid:18)p(x) 

e


a(x)(cid:19)2

+

1
2

[(x)]2 ,

which is supplemented by a gauss law constraint on physical states,

gb(x) = e(x) 

e


(x) = 0 ,

(31)

(32)

where e(x) and a(x) = a1(x) are the electric and photon elds as dened in the previous

section, (x) is the boson eld, and p(x) its canonical momentum. since the hamiltonian

is quadratic in terms of bosonic elds and their conjugate momenta, the exact ground state

wave functional can be readily found,

0[a, ] = exp(cid:20) ie

1

(33)

2z dx dy (x)1(x  y)(y)(cid:21) ,
with 1(k) =pk2 + e2/ and the sux 0 indicates the exact ground state.

 z dx (x)a(x) 

we now want to show that this result is recovered within the variational calculation. we

base our variational ansatz upon a gaussian,

exp(cid:20)

1

2z dx dy a(x)g1(x  y)a(y) 

1

2z dx dy (x) 1(x  y)(y)(cid:21) ,

(34)

9

with g(x  y) and  as variational parameters. projecting this onto the gauge invariant
subspace with the help of the gauss law eq.(32) we have the gauge invariant trial state,

b[a, ] =z d exp(cid:20)

1

2z dx dy a(x)g1(x  y)a(y)



1

2z dx dy (x) 1(x  y)(y) +

ie

z dx (x)(x)(cid:21) .

(35)

proceeding with the variational calculation in the usual way, we nd the expectation

value of the hamiltonian to be,

1

e2


4z dk
 (cid:20) e2
4z dk

(k)(cid:19)1

2(cid:18)g1(k) +
g1(k) (k) +(cid:16) (k)g(k)(cid:17)1
(cid:19) y 1(k) ,
2(cid:18)y 2(k) + k2 +

where

2e2


+ k2 (k)g1(k) +

e4

2 g(k) (k)(cid:21)

y (k) = 1(k) +

e2


g(k) .

variational minimization of (36) with respect to y (k) yields the required solution,

y 2(k) =(cid:18) 1(k) +

e2


g(k)(cid:19)2

=(cid:18)k2 +

e2

(cid:19) .

(36)

(37)

(38)

after substituting into (35) and integrating over , we nd that the best variational state

is indeed (33), so the variational calculation gives the exact result.

note that our initial parameterization of the trial state turned out to be somewhat

redundant. the energy minimization determines only y but not g and  separately. it is

in fact true that integrating over  in equation (35) we obtain a gaussian in  with width y .

this redundancy however can be used to establish the equivalence of this calculation with

the calculation in terms of the fermionic representation of the previous section. the point

is that we can choose  to be the width of the ground state in the free massless bosonic

theory,

1 = k2 .

10

(39)

the exact ground state is then represented as a gauge projected product of the vacuum wave

functional of a theory of a massless boson and a gaussian functional of the gauge potential

a. in fact for this choice of , eq.(38) gives the same result for the width of the gauge eld

gaussian g as the fermionic solution eq.(30). also the free massless fermion by bosonisation

is equivalent to the free massless boson. therefore the fermionic part of the variational state

of the previous section for m = 0 is equivalent to the free massless state for the bosonic eld

. we therefore see that our variational solution of the previous section is equivalent to the

solution obtained here, and is therefore an exact ground state.

iv. conclusions

in this paper we have presented a variational analysis of the massless schwinger model.

we have shown that there exists a simple and natural way to extend the gauge invariant

variational ansatz of [1] to systems with fermions. we have also found that in this simple

and well understood system our variational ansatz in fact includes the exact ground state

and therefore reproduces known exact results.

a noteworthy feature of the best variational state is that the dynamical mass in the

fermionic sector is not generated, so that in terms of fermionic part the state seems to be

trivial. in fact in 2 dimensional theory this is not entirely surprising. if we were to consider

a theory with more than one avour, this would have been an immediate corollary of the

coleman theorem. since a continuous (chiral) symmetry can not be broken in 2 d, the state

with nonvanishing dynamical mass should be strongly energetically disfavoured. in the one

avour theory which we are considering here, such an a priori argument does not apply since

the axial u(1) symmetry is anomalous. nevertheless it is not unnatural that in terms of the

dynamical mass the ground states in one avour and multiavour theories are similar.

on the other hand in the one avour case the fermionic bilinear condensate  should

be nonvanishing precisely due to the same anomaly. it is therefore interesting to see whether

our best trial state leads to such a nonvanishing condensate.

11

it is simplest to calculate the condensate rst in the bosonized version of the theory. the

bosonization rules prescribe the identication [9],

(x)(x) = 

c e

 ne/ cosh4(x)i ,

(40)

where ne/ means normal ordering with respect to the free boson eld of mass e/, and

the prefactor is c = exp ()/2, with  being eulers constant [10]. we need the average of

(40) over the wavefunctional (35). after integrating over a and  we obtain

h (x)(x)i = 

c e

 ne/z d exp(cid:20)
+ez dy (x  y) (y)   (0)(cid:21) .

1

4z dy dz (y) (cid:18)g1(y  z) +

e2


(y  z)(cid:19) (z)

(41)

using the denition (37), a further integration over  yields

h (x)(x)i = 

c e

 ne/ exp(cid:2)y 1(x  x)(cid:3)

(42)

the exponential is uv divergent, but it cancels exactly with the normal ordering factor, so

we nally obtain

h (x)(x)i = 

e exp ()

23/2

,

(43)

which is the exact result [11].

the same calculation can be performed in the fermionic formalism. we need to calculate

h (x)(x)i =z d d  d (x)(x) exp(cid:20)

1

4z dy dz (y)g1(y  z)(z)

+iz dt dx (x, t) (i  ea) (y, t)(cid:21) ,

(44)

with a0(x, t) = (x)(t) and a1(x, t) = 0. here we have used the path integral representation

of the average over the massless fermion vacuum state eq.(11). to perform the integration

over the fermions we can use the results of [12]. the fermionic integral is non-vanishing

only for background elds with instanton number 1. decomposing a =   , we
obtain

12

h (x)(x)i = const. z d exp(cid:20)

1

2z dy log(x  y) (y)(cid:21) .

1

4z dy dz (y) s(y  z) (z)

+

here we have used

(45)

(46)

(cid:3)(x, t) = (x) (t)  (x, t = 0) =

1

2 z dy log(x  y)(y) .

with  given by eq.(39) this coincides with eq.(41) and so the subsequent integration

over  again reproduces eq.(43).

we have thus seen that in this simple model the gauge invariant variational gaussian

approximation works well. extension of this approach to four dimensional qcd with chiral

symmetry breaking is the next challenging task.
