abstract

we complete our study of non-abelian gauge theories in the framework of epstein-glaser
approach to renormalization theory including in the model an arbitrary number of dirac
fermions. we consider the consistency of the model up to the third order of the pertur-
bation theory. in the second order we obtain pure group theoretical relations expressing
a representation property of the numerical coecients appearing in the left and right
handed components of the interaction lagrangian. in the third order of the perturbation
theory we obtain the so called axial anomalies. however, we get some discrepancies in
comparison to the standard literature. more precisely, we prove that one has to consider
two group-covariant tensors instead of the usual one.

1 introduction

in some preceding papers [12], [13] we have extended results of aste, dutsch and scharf [3],
[10], [4] concerning the uniqueness of the non-abelian gauge theory describing the consistent
interaction bosons of spin 1.
it appeared that the gauge invariance principle is a natural
consequence of the description of spin-one particles in a factor hilbert space: gauge invariance
expresses the possibility of factorizing the s-matrix to the physical space, which is usually
constructed using the existence of a supercharge q according to the cohomological-type formula:
hphys = ker(q)/im(q). the obstructions to such a factorization process are the well-known
anomalies. the case when the spin-one bosons of non-null mass are admitted in the game was
studied in [10], [4] for the concrete case of the electro-weak interaction i.e. when the gauge
group is exactly su(2)  u(1).
in [13] we have analyzed the same problem considering that the spin-one bosons can have
non-null masses and we did not impose any restriction on their number and masses and we
did not took into account the matter elds. similar results have been obtained in [18]. we
have obtained only from the condition of absence of the anomaly up to the second order the
existence of a lie algebra g and the existence of a representation of this lie algebra pertaining
to the higgs elds.

in this paper, we consider the eect of including dirac fermions. in this way we are able to
investigate a truly realistic model of gauge interactions of elementary particle and, in particular,
to see what are the restrictions on such a model determined by the cancellation of all anomalies.
the main results are the following ones.

(a) the cancellation of the anomaly in the second order of the perturbation theory brings
new relations on the numerical coecients of the left and right handed components of the
interaction lagrangian. more precisely, new group theoretical property appear:

(i) the coecients of the vectorial and pseudo-vectorial couplings can be organized as two
a with a, b, . . . = 1, . . . , r group indices; the usual

a and t

representations of the gauge algebra: t+
notations are tr

a and tl
a .

(ii) the coecients of the scalar and pseudo-scalar couplings can be organized as some

tensor operators.

some of these relations have been obtained from dierent considerations in [20], [6].
(b) the cancellation of the anomaly in the third order of the perturbation theory shows
that the usual condition of cancellation of the axial anomaly must be amended. in fact, we
prove that one has to consider two tensors, one of vectorial and the other of the axial nature

and respectively

vabc  x1,2,3=

aabc  x1,2,3=

(1 + 12 + 23 + 31) t r (t1

a [t2

b , t3

c ])

(1 + 2 + 3 + 123) t r (t1

a {t2

b , t3

c })

and the anomalies are absent i we have one of the following two possibilities:

(a) vabc 6 0; or

1

(b) vabc = 0, aabc = 0.
(c) a new condition on the structure of the dirac currents appear.
it is interesting that condition on the couplings of the higgs elds do not appear.
we mention here that the term aabc is similar to the one appearing in the usual treatments
[1], [7], [2], [5], [15], [16]. however, the usual

of the adler-bardeen-bell-jackiw anomaly.
expression is given by (see for instance [21]):

aabj

a {t+
abc  t r(cid:0)t+

b , t+

a {t
c }(cid:1)  t r(cid:0)t

b , t

c }(cid:1) .

the complete analysis of these new consistency conditions should play a major role in the
study of realistic physical models. in particular they should be fullled by the standard model.
we will do this elsewhere. it is important to mention however, that the condition (b) subcase
(a) seems to be much easier to full that the usual condition of cancelation of the axial anomaly.
in this sense, our analysis shows that there is more freedom in model building, than it is usually
imagined.

the structure of the paper is the following one.

in the next section we summarize the
description of non-null mass spin-one bosons and construct the the s-matrix up to the second
order of the as in [13]. next, in section 3, we consider the coupling of yang-mills elds
with dirac fermions and, as anticipated above, we obtain some interesting group-theoretical
relations. the complete analysis of all these pure group-theoretical restrictions could x very
severely the possible generalizations of the standard model. in section 4 we go to the third order
of the perturbation theory. in [18] the analysis of the pure boson sector is performed and leads
to some restrictions on the coupling of the higgs bosons; we do not obtain these conditions in
our analysis. we investigate the dirac fermionic sector and we get the new conditions on the
fermionic representations (a) or (b) from above. in the end we particularize the formalism for
the case of the standard model with one generation of dirac particles.

for the sake of clarity of the rather long and intricate analysis we adopt the mathematical

denition - theorem style of presenting various assertions and computations.

2 general description of the vector bosons

2.1 spin-one relativistic free particles

with positive mass

as in [12], we take the one-particle space of the problem h to be the hilbert space of an unitary
irreducible representation of the poincare group. we give below the relevant formul for
particles of mass m > 0 and spin one.

the upper hyperboloid of mass m  0 is by denition the set of functions x +
m(p)  dp

m  {p 
r4| kpk2 = m2} which are square integrable with respect to the lorentz invariant measure
d+
2(p) ; (in fact only classes of functions identical up to null-measure sets are consid-
ered). the conventions are the following: k  k is the minkowski norm dened by kpk2  p  p
and p  q is the minkowski bilinear form p  q  p0q0  p  q. if p  r3 we dene  (p)  x +
according to  (p)  ((p), p), (p) pp2 + m2.
let us consider the hilbert space h  l2(x +

m) with the scalar product

m, c4, d+

m

< ,  >zx +

m

d+

m(p) < (p), (p) >c4

(2.1.1)

i=1 uivi is the usual scalar product from c4. in this hilbert space we have

where < u, v >c4p4

the following (non-unitary) representation of the poincare group:

(ua,) (p)  eiap  (1  p)

for   l,

(uit) (p)  (is  p)

(2.1.2)

and the following non-degenerate sesquilinear form:

(, ) zx +

m

d+

m(p)

g(p)(p);

(2.1.3)

the indices ,  take the values 0, 1, 2, 3 and the summation convention over the dummy indices
is used. then one has

(ua,, ua,) = (, ),

for   l,

(uit, uit) = (, ).

(2.1.4)

p(p) = 0}. then one can prove
let us consider the following subspace of h: hm  {  h|
that the sesquilinear form (,)|hm is strictly positively dened.
as a consequence, the representation (2.1.4) of the poincare group leaves invariant the
subspace hm and the restriction of this representation to this subspace (also denoted by u)
is equivalent to the unitary irreducible representation h[m,1] of the poincare group (describing
particles of mass m > 0 and spin 1 [19].) the couple (hm, u) is called a spin-one boson of
mass m.

we turn now to the second quantization procedure applied to such an elementary system.

we express the (bosonic) fock space of the system fm  f +(hm)  n0h
subspace of an auxiliary fock space h  f +(h)  n0hn, h0  c.

one canonically identies the nth-particle subspace hn with the set of borel functions :
1,...,n(k1, . . . , kn) : (x +
m)n  c which are square integrable and verify convenient symmetry
in h the expression of the scalar product is naturally induced by (2.1.1) and we have a
g  p; (here ug is given by
n, n  1

adopted previously for the hilbert space hn we can take them to be formed by those elements
n which verify the transversality condition k1
of h
moreover, the sesquilinear form (,)|h is strictly positively dened and there exists an
canonical isomorphism of hilbert spaces fm  h.
we can dene the corresponding eld as an operator on the hilbert space h in complete
analogy to the electromagnetic eld; we dene for every p  x +
m the usual annihilation and
creation operators a(p) and a

(p) and next, the eld operators in the point x according to

m) and also hgh

have to introduce beside the fermionic ghosts some bosonic ghost.

we now give an alternative description of the fock space fm using the ghosts elds; we
we consider the hilbert space hgh
  l2(x +
m, c, d+
m)
with the natural scalar products. in this spaces act the usual unitary representations of the
poincare group. the fock space f gh  f (hgh
+ ) is called ghost particle hilbert
space. let us dene the auxiliary fock space hgh  h  f gh where h has been dened previ-
ously. we can write hgh = 
n,w,l,s=0hnwls where one can identify hnwls with the set of borel
functions (nwls)
0 )n+w+l+s  c which are square integrable with respect to
the product measure (+
m)(n+w+l+s) and verify convenient (anti) symmetry properties.; here
k  (k1, . . . , kn), p  (p1, . . . , pw), q  (q1, . . . , ql) and r  (r1, . . . , rl).
 (t), b#(t)
c#(t) and a#(t) (see [13]). they verify usual canonical (anti)commutation relations and behave
naturally with respect to poincare transformations.

in this representation we can construct the annihilation and creation operators a#

1,...,n(k; p ; q; r) : (x +

 )  f +(hgh

+  l2(x +

then the elds u(x),

u(x) and (x) can be constructed; they are called the fermionic

(resp. bosonic) ghost elds.

now we can dene the operator:

q zx +

m

d+

m(q)(cid:2)k(cid:0)a(k)c(k) + a

(k)b(k)(cid:1) + im (a(k)c(k)  a(k)b(k))(cid:3)

called supercharge. its most important property is

q2 = 0 = im(q)  ker(q).

(2.1.13)

(2.1.14)

an explicit expression of the supercharge in this representation can be found in [13].
as a consequence, we have

theorem 2.1 there exists the following vector spaces isomorphism:

where the subspace h has been dened previously. the isomorphism (2.1.15) extends to a
hilbert space isomorphism:

ker(q)/im(q)  h

(2.1.15)

(with an appropriate scalar product) and the factorized representation of the poincare group
coincides with the representation acting into the space h.

ker(q)/im(q)  fm

one can easily see that one can take the limit m  0 in the expressions for the various
hilbert spaces and quantum elds and also on the expression of the supercharge q.in this
limit we can write hgh  hgh
is the hilbert space generated by the elds
a(x), u(x), u(x) and h is generated by the scalar ghosts. then the supercharge (2.1.13)
takes the form q = q  1 where q coincides formally with the expression of q for m  0 but
acts only in hgh
0 . moreover, we have: ker(q)/im(q)  ker(q)/im(q)h i.e. we can see
that the states from h decouple completely and can be considered physical. moreover, one
can see that, in this case, nothing prevents us to consider that the scalar ghost has a non-zero

0  h where hgh

mass. this observation is essential for the construction of the standard model, because a scalar
ghost eld corresponding to a null mass boson, if considered a physical eld of non-zero mass
is nothing else but the higgs eld [4].

one denotes by w the linear space of all wick monomials on the fock space hgh i.e.
containing the elds a(x), u(x), u(x) and (x). if m is such a wick monomial, we dene by
gh(m) the degree in u (resp. in u). the ghost number is, by denition, the expression:

the brst operator is dened by linearity, the action on the elementary elds:

gh(m)  gh+(m)  gh(m)

(2.1.16)

dqu = 0,

dqu = i(a + m),

dqa = iu,

dq = imu;

(2.1.17)

and the derivation property:

dq(mn) = (dqm)n + (1)gh(m )m(dqn),

m, n  w.

(2.1.18)

the class of all observables on the factor space emerges (see theorem 2.1): an operator
o : hgh  hgh induces a well dened operator [o] on the factor space ker(q)/im(q)  fm if
and only if it veries: dqo|ker(q) = 0. because d2
q = 0, not all operators verifying the condition
(2.1) are interesting. in fact, the operators of the type dqo are inducing a null operator on the
factor space; explicitly, we have:

is trivial.

[dqo] = 0.

(2.1.19)
if the interaction lagrangian is a wick monomial t1  w with gh(t1) 6= 0 then the s-matrix
the analysis of the possible interactions between the bosonic spin-one eld and matter
follows the usual lines (see [13]). let hmatter be the corresponding hilbert space of the matter
elds; it is elementary to see that we can realize the total hilbert space htotal  fm  hmatter
as the factor space ker(q)/im(q) where the supercharge q is dened on hgh  hgh hmatter
by the obvious substitution q  q  1.
the canonical dimension (w ) of a wick monomial w is dened by adding 1 (resp. 3/2)
for every integer spin eld factor or derivative (resp. half-integer spin eld factor). for a wick
polynomial, the canonical dimension is the upper bound of the canonical dimensions of the
monomial summands.

6

2.2 massive yang-mills fields

as in [13], we rst dene in an unambiguous way what we mean by yang-mills elds. all
the elds will carry an additional index a = 1, . . . , r and this can be realized with an ap-
propriate modication of the hilbert spaces (auxiliary or physical). so we have the elds:
a = 1, . . . , r given by obvious expressions in such a way that the one-particle
aa, ua, ua, a
subspace is a direct sum of r copies of elementary heavy bosons of masses ma,
a = 1, . . . , r
and spin 1.

these elds verify the following equations of motion:

((cid:3) + m2

a)ua(x) = 0,

((cid:3) + m2

a)ua(x) = 0,

((cid:3) + m2

a)a(x) = 0,

a = 1, . . . , r.

(2.2.1)

the canonical (anti)commutation relations are:

{ua(x), ub(y)} = abdma(x  y)  1,

[aa(x), ab(y)] = abgdma(x  y)  1,
[a(x), b(y)] = abdma(x  y)  1;

(2.2.2)

and all other (anti)commutators are null. the supercharge is given by (see (2.1.13)):

q 

r

xa=1zx +

ma

d+

ma(q)(cid:2)k(cid:0)aa(k)c

a(k) + a

a(k)ba(k)(cid:1) + ima(cid:0)aa(k)c

a(k)  a

a(k)ba(k)(cid:1)(cid:3)(2.2.3)

and veries all the expected properties.

the krein operator can be dened and used to construct a sesquilinear form such that we

have

aa(x) = aa(x),

ua(x) = ua(x),

ua(x) = ua(x), a(x) = a(x).

(2.2.4)

the ghost degree is dened in an obvious way and the expression of the brst operator is

similar to the previous one. in particular we have (see (2.1.17)):

dqua = 0,

dq ua = i(a

a + maa),

dqa

a = iua,

dqa = imaua,

a = 1, . . . , r.

(2.2.5)
if we take into account the last observation from the preceding subsection, it appears that
it is possible to make in the formalism presented above some of the masses null. in this case the
corresponding scalar ghosts can be considered as physical elds and they will be called higgs
elds. moreover, we do not have to assume that they are massless i.e. if some boson eld a
a
has zero mass ma = 0, we can suppose that the corresponding higgs eld a has a non-zero
mass: mh

a . if we use the compact notation

m

a (cid:26) ma

mh
a

for ma 6= 0
for ma = 0

this will imply that the last equation (2.2.1) will be replaced by

[(cid:3) + (m

a)2]a(x) = 0

7

(2.2.6)

(2.2.7)

and the last relation of (2.2.2) will become:

[a(x), b(y)] = abdm

a(x  y)  1;

(2.2.8)

here a = 1, . . . , r.

moreover, this process of attributing a non-zero mass to the scalar partners of the zero-
mass vector elds should not inuence the brst transformation formula (2.2.5); thats it, this
formula remains unchanged.

we will construct a perturbation theory a la epstein-glaser for the free elds a

a, ua, ua and
a = 1, . . . , r in the auxiliary hilbert space hgh,r
a,
y m imposing the usual axioms of causality,
unitarity and relativistic invariance. moreover, we want that the result factorizes to the physical
hilbert space in the adiabatic limit. this amounts to

lim0 dqz(r4)n

dx1    dxng(x1)   g(xn)tn(x1, . . . , xn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ker(q)

= 0,

n  1.

(2.2.9)

if this condition if fullled, then the chronological and the antichronological products do
factorize to the physical hilbert space and they give a perturbation theory verifying causality,
unitarity and relativistic invariance.

one may raise at this point the rather serious objection that the adiabatic limit probably
does not exists. one way to cure this problem is to replace the condition of factorization
(2.2.9) by the innitesimal version postulated in [3] - [10], namely:

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) = i

n

xl=1


x
l

t 
l (x1, . . . , xn)

(2.2.10)

l (x1, . . . , xn),

for some wick polynomials t 
l = 1, . . . , n which must be determined recurringly,
together with the chronological products, and to construct the s-matrix s(g) for a test function
g, that is without performing the adiabatic limit g  1.
however, this point of view is not without problems. indeed, if one imposes (2.2.10) in-
stead of (2.2.9), then the s-matrix so constructed will not factorize to the physical space
ker(q)/im(q) which raises the question about its physical relevance. to this one must add
the rather unpleasant fact that one abandons the consistency condition (2.2.9) which has a
direct physical relevance (the possibility of constructing an s-matrix in the physical space
ker(q)/im(q)) for an independent postulate (2.2.10). on the other hand, the rather close
connection between (2.2.9) and (2.2.10) suggests that there must exists a common cure for
both types of problems. thats it, if one can nd a reasonable solution of the adiabatic limit
problem,, then it is reasonable to conjecture that one will be able to strengthen the mathemat-
ical status of (2.2.9) and, eventually, prove its equivalence with (2.2.10). in what follows we
will use the consistency condition in the following form:

dqz(r4)n

dx1    dxng(x1)   g(xn)tn(x1, . . . , xn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ker(q)

= 0(),

n  1.

(2.2.11)

if one completely exploits the condition of gauge invariance in the rst order of perturbation
theory obtaining the generic form of the yang-mills interaction of spin-one bosons. we assume
the summation convention of the dummy indices a, b, . . . = 1, . . . , r. the result from [13] is:

theorem 2.2 let us consider the operator

t1(g) =zr4

dx g(x)t1(x)

(2.2.12)

dened on hgh,r
y m with t1 a lorentz-invariant wick polynomial in a, u, u and  verifying also
3  (t1)  4. if t1(g) factorizes, in the adiabatic limit, to the physical hilbert space, then it
necessarily has the following form:

t1(g) =zr4

dx g(x) [t11(x) + t12(x) + t13(x) + t14(x)]

(2.2.13)

where we have introduced the following notations:

t11(x)  fabc [: aa(x)ab(x)a

a(x) :  : a

a(x)ub(x) uc(x) :] ,

t12(x)  f

moreover, we have:

corollary 2.3 in the condition of the preceding theorem, one has:

and the expression from this formula are dened as follows:

the expression t1 from the preceding theorem veries the unitarity condition

(x  y)2 < 0.

one can causally split this commutator and obtain the generic expression of t2(x, y); in
general, this is not a well-dened operator on the factor space hr
y m . one can show that this
can happen if and only if some severe restrictions are placed on the constants appearing in the
expression of the interaction lagrangian.

theorem 2.4 the generic expression of the distribution t2 leads, in the adiabatic limit, to an
well dened operator on hr

the group-theoretical informations contained in this theorem are:

corollary 2.5 (a) the expressions fabc are the structure constants of a lie algebra g.

(b) the structure constants fabc corresponding to ma = mb = mc = 0 generate a lie

subalgebra g0  g.

(c) the r  r (antisymmetric) matrices ta,

a = 1, . . . , r dened according to

bca,

a, b, c = 1, . . . , r.

(2.2.32)

are an r-dimensional representation of the lie algebra g.

10

the representation ta exhibited in the statement of the theorem is nothing else but the

representation of the gauge group g into which the higgs elds live.

one can prove that

f 
abc = mcgabc,

a, b, c = 1, . . . , r

s.t. ma = 0, mb 6= 0

(2.2.33)

where the constants gabc are constrained only by the symmetry property in the last two indices

gabc = gacb.

(2.2.34)

now we have

corollary 2.6 suppose that the constants fabc, f 
abc verify the conditions from the
statements of theorems 2.2 and 2.4. then, the general expression for the chronological product
t2 is given by:

(2.2.35)

the expression t 0

2 (x, y) is obtained according to the canonical causal splitting of the com-

mutator [t1(x), t1(y)] and l(x) is an nite normalization of the type (2.2.13).

3 yang-mills fields coupled to matter

3.1 first order of the perturbation theory

we study here the possibility of coupling yang-mills elds to matter. we suppose that we
are given the hilbert space of matter hmatter which should also be a fock space. then
the coupled system is described in the tensor product hilbert space fy m  hmatter. one can
describe this fock space considering hgh,r
y mhmatter with the corresponding supercharge
operator and forming the quotient ker(q)/im(q). we will consider here that the matter is
formed from dirac fermions only.

y m  hgh,r

first, we generalize theorem 2.2:

theorem 3.1 let us consider the operator

t1(g) =zr4

dx g(x)t1(x)

(3.1.1)

dened on hgh,r
y m with t1 a lorentz-invariant wick polynomial in aa, ua , ua , a and the
matter elds, verifying also 3  (t1)  4. then t1(g) can induce an well dened non-trivial
s-matrix, in the adiabatic limit, if and only if it has the following form:

t1(g) =zr4

dx g(x)[t y m

1

(x) + a

1
ma

a(x)j

a (x)

a(x)ja(x) + xma6=0
+ xma=0

a(x)ja(x) + t1,matter(x)]

(3.1.2)

here ja and ja are lorentz covariant currents build only from the matter elds with (ja) =
1, 2, 3 and t1,matter contains only the matter elds. moreover the following conservation law
should be valid:

the expression for t1 veries the unitarity requirement if and only if we have:

j

a (x) = 0,

ma = 0.

a = 1, . . . , r,
and veries the causality condition if and only if:

j
a (x) = j

a (x),

ja(x) = ja(x),

ma = 0

[j

a (x), j

b (y)] = 0,

[ja(x), jb(y)] = 0,

(x  y)2 < 0,
(x  y)2 < 0,

a, b = 1, . . . , r,
ma = mb = 0,

[j

a (x), jb(x)] = 0,

(x  y)2 < 0,

mb = 0.

(3.1.3)

(3.1.4)

(3.1.5)

(3.1.6)

(3.1.7)

12

proof:
beside the terms considered in theorem 2.2 we have to include terms containing explicitly
the dirac fermions. lorentz covariance and power counting limit these terms to t1,matter(x)
and:

t11,matter(x)  a

a(x)ja(x), t12,matter(x)  a(x)ja(x)

(3.1.8)

with ja (ja) a lorentz covariant (resp. invariant) operator. proceeding in the same way as for
the proof of theorem 2.2, we obtain a supplementary restriction, namely:

maja = j
a ,

a = 1, . . . , r.

in other words, for ma = 0 we get (3.1.3) and for ma 6= 0 we get:

ja =

1
ma

j
a .

(3.1.9)

(3.1.10)

the expression from the statement emerges. the other assertions are straightforward, al-

though rather tedious to verify. (cid:4)

corollary 3.2 the following formula is true

dqt1(x) = i


x t 

1 (x)

(3.1.11)

where t 
(see (2.2.26) and (2.2.27)) the following contribution due to the presence of matter:

1 is obtained by adding to the corresponding expression from the pure yang-mills case

t 
13(x)  ua(x)j

a (x).

(3.1.12)

now we get in detail the structure of the interaction lagrangian in the following two propo-

sitions. we have:

proposition 3.3 suppose that the dirac fermions generating hmatter are a of masses ma 
0, a = 1, . . . , n. then the generic form of the currents from the preceding theorem are:

a (x) =: a(x)(ta)abb(x) : + : a(x)(t
j

a)ab5b(x) :

(3.1.13)

and

ja(x) =: a(x)(sa)abb(x) : + : a(x)(s

a)ab5b(x) :

(3.1.14)

the causality conditions from theorem 3.1 are fullled and the hermiticity conditions are
a = 1, . . . r are her-

sa,

equivalent with the fact that the complex n  n matrices ta,
mitian and s
a,

a = 1, . . . , r anti-hermitian.

t
a,

let us dene the mass matrix by:

mab  a,bma,

a, b = 1, . . . , n.

(3.1.15)

then we have:

13

proposition 3.4 the following mass relations are true:

sa =

i
ma

[m, ta],

s
a =

a},

ma 6= 0,

(3.1.16)

i
ma{m, t
a} = 0,

[m, ta] = 0,

in particular, the matrices ta,

(3.1.17)
ma = 0 can be exhibited into a block diagonal structure
(eventually after a relabelling of the dirac elds) and the masses corresponding to the same
block must be equal.

ma = 0.

{m, t

proof: it is easy to show that the conservation law (3.1.9) is equivalent to the two relations

from the statement. (cid:4)

corollary 3.5 let us dene

t
a  ta + t
a,

s
a  ta + s
a,

a = 1, . . . , r,

(3.1.18)

here  = . then, the relations (3.1.16) and (3.1.17) are equivalent to:

s

i

(mt

and the hermiticity conditions are equivalent to:

(s

a) = s

a = 1, . . . , r,

3.2 second order of the perturbation theory

let us dene some distributions with causal support which will be needed in the next proposition
and which do appear in spinorial qed [17]:

s()
m (x)  (i   + m)d()

m (x), sm (x)  s(+)

m (x) + s()

m (x) = (i   + m)dm (x)

(3.2.1)

the causal splitting

induces a similar splitting for the distribution sm (x) and in this way the feynman propagator
can be obtained. we also have the distribution with causal support:

dm (x) = dadv

m (x)  dret

m (x)

m,m (x)  d(+)

m (x)s(+)

m (x)  d()

m (x)s()

m (x).

(3.2.2)

a = 1, . . . , r.

a = 1, . . . , n,
a = 1, . . . , r):

ab,(x),

ab,(x) + p ()
ab,(x)  p ()
ab (x) + p ()

ab,(x),

ab (x), (3.2.3)

ab,(x),

ab,(x),

ab,(x) + q()
ab,(x)  q()
ab(x) + q()

ab(x), (3.2.4)

for simplicity we will denote: sa  sma, a,a  ma,ma,
we also need the following distributions (here a, b = 1, . . . , n,
ab,(x)  t rhs()
ab,(x)  t rhs()

a (x)s(+)

ab,(x), qa;ab;(x)  q(+)

a;ab;(x) + p ()
a;ab;(x) + q()

a;ab;(x),
a;ab;(x).

(3.2.5)

all these distribution can be split causally and preserving lorentz covariance and we will

denote the corresponding retarded, advanced and feynman distributions in an obvious way.

then we have the following generalization of the formul from [13]:

proposition 3.6 suppose that that there is no contribution t1,matter in the rst order chrono-
logical product. then, the generic form of the second order chronological product is:

the proof consists, as usual, in the explicit computation of the commutator d2, more

precisely of the supplementary terms coming from the currents.

finally, we check if the expression just derived induces an well-dened operator on the

physical space.

which are equivalent to the relations (3.2.7) from the statement of the theorem. the analysis of
the terms of the type : u  : from the anomaly is more subtle. using the notations (3.2.10)
from the statement of the theorem we can write this piece of the anomaly in the condensed
form:

a0(x) = i : ua(x)b(x)a(x)(tab1 + t

and we try to write it as a coboundary dql(x) with

(3.2.24)

(3.2.25)

where we can suppose that the constants cab,

for mb 6= 0 this is a identity according to the preceding relation. for mb = 0 we get the
relation (3.2.8) from the statement. the expression for (3.2.9) now follows from (3.2.30) and
the expression of the nite renormalization l(x). (cid:4)

the relations obtained in this theorem have a pure group-theoretical meaning; the relation
(3.2.7) tells that the matrices t
a are representations of the lie algebra g and relation (3.2.8)
shows that the matrices s
a for ma = 0 are some tensor operators with respect to the couple
of representations t
b of the lie subalgebra g0. so, we propose the following strategy of ana-
lyzing the generalization of the standard model described in this paper: rst one should nd
out restrictions on the lie algebra g from the relation (2.2.29), then one takes a couple of
representations t
a for ma 6= 0 from
the relation (3.1.19) and for ma = 0 from the relation (3.2.8) using ideas from the proof of
wigner-eckart theorem. we mention that if one tries to substitute the formula (3.1.19) into
the formula (3.2.8), as it is done in [3], then we end up with some very complicated trilinear
relations which are extremely dicult to analyze in the general case.

in closing this subsection we exhibit now some total divergence structures which will be of
use in the analysis of the factorization condition in the third order of the perturbation theory.

2(x, y) + i(x  y)l(x)

(3.2.36)

where l(x) has been dened previously by (2.2.36). then the following total divergence structure
is true:

dqrc

2(x, y) = i

this corollary leads us to a formula of the same nature as (3.1.11), that is a total divergence

structure for the second order chronological products.

2(x, y) + t1(y)t1(x)

then one has

(3.2.41)

the expressions t 

i (x, y) and t


i (x, y), (i = 1, 2) have causal factorization properties of the

same type as the chronological products, thats it:

t

the sign  means causal succession.

the proof is elementary and consists in noticing that we have:

(3.2.43)

(3.2.44)

the causal factorization properties are now elementary because we have nice support prop-

erties for the expressions r

i (x, y), for i = 1, 2.

4 third-order gauge invariance

4.1 causal splitting of distribution

we remind here the basic facts about distribution splitting, following essentially [17]. we will
use, for simplicity formal notations. let d(x)  s (rm) be a distribution. we say that it has
the quasi-asymptotics d0(x)  s (rm) in x = 0 with respect to the continuous and positive
function  if for any test function (x) the following limit exists:

lim0

()mzrm

dmx d(x)(x)

(4.1.1)

exists and determines a distribution d0(x) 6 0. equivalently, in momentum space, we say that
the distribution d(p)  s (rm) has the quasi-asymptotics d0(p)  s (rm) in p =  if the
following limit exists:

lim0

dmp d(1p)(p)

()zrm
exists and determines a distribution d0(p) 6 0.
(a)
() exists and it is of the form
0(a) = a. the number  is called the order of singularity of the distribution. we note for
further use the following fact:

in both cases, one can show that the limit 0(a)  lim0

(4.1.2)

lemma 4.1 if di,
distribution d  d1 + d2 has the order of singularity  = max(1, 2).

i = 1, 2 are two distributions with order of singularity 1 6= 2 then the
if 1 = 2 then the same assertion stays true if the two distributions have dierent supports.

let us dene the causal cones with apex x by:

v +(x)  {y  r4|(y  x)2  0,
and the following subsets from r4n:

y0  x0},

v (x)  {y  r4|(y  x)2  0,

y0  x0}(4.1.3)


n (x)  {(x1, . . . , xn)  r4n|xj  v (x),

j = 1, . . . , n}.

(4.1.4)

then we say that the distribution d(x)  s (r4n) has causal support if we have supp(d) 
n (0)  
+
n (0). we say that the couple of distributions (a, r) is a causal decomposition of a
distribution d with causal support if we have

d = a  r, with supp(a)  +

n (0),

supp(r)  

n (0).

(4.1.5)

it is possible to show that such a decomposition always exists. we can give explicit formul
for the fourier transforms of a and r. because of the translational invariance we have m =
4(n  1) in this case.

22

proposition 4.2 suppose  < 0. in this case, the causal splitting (4.1.5) is unique if we
impose that the distributions a and r have the same order of singularity  as the distribution
d. moreover, we have the following expressions:

a(p) =

i

2zr

dt

t + i0

d(p  tv),

r(p) =

i

2zr

dt
t  i0

d(p  tv)

(4.1.6)

where v  +
formul do not depend on the choice of v.

n (0) is arbitrary. in particular, this means that the right hand sides of the preceding

we call the preceding causal splitting the minimal solution.

in the case of positive singularity order, the formul are more complicated. we give them

for a particular but important case.

proposition 4.3 suppose  > 0 and that there exists an open set e  rm such that 0  e
and e  supp( d) = .
then, for any    there exists a causal distribution given by the following formulfor
n (0)  
p  +

n (0):

d(tp)

.

a(p) =

1
2i

(p10)zr

dt

d(tp)

,

r(p) =

1
2i

(p10)zr

dt

t+1(t  1 + i0(p10))
(4.1.7)
for an arbitrary p these distributions can be reconstructed by analytic continuation. the

t+1(t  1  i0(p10))

order of singularity of the distributions a and r is .

we call the splitting given above the central solution. for  =  we say that we have
a minimal solution. there is a dierence between the two case, namely, for positive order of
singularity, one can nd other splittings of the distribution d such that (a) = (r) = (d). in
fact, the arbitrariness can be shown to be an arbitrary polynomial of maximal degree  in p.

we also note that if the distribution d has some supplementary invariance properties, as for

instance, poincare invariance, the central splitting preserves them.

now we dene in an abstract setting the notion of anomaly. let d be a set of distributions

with order of singularity  and with causal support. let us dene the distribution

d 


x
1

d.

(4.1.8)

suppose that one can nd some distribution splittings d = a  r and d = a  r such that

a =


x
1

a,

r =


x
1

r.

(4.1.9)

then we say that there is no anomaly. on the contrary, if such a splitting does not exists, we
call the expression

a

(4.1.10)


x

23

an anomaly. the main problem in establishing the gauge invariance of the s-matrix (or in our
approach, the possibility of factorizing s to the physical hilbert space) comes from the possible
appearance of anomalies in the process distribution splitting.

we can describe rather well the expression of the anomalies in two cases and we will see

that these cases are all we need to perform the splittings in the next subsection. we have:

proposition 4.4 in the conditions described above, suppose that we have (d) < 0 and (d) <
0. then, if we apply the distribution splitting described by prop. 4.2 to d and d, there is no
anomaly.

the proof consists in simply computing the anomaly according to the denition (4.1.10)
and observe that it is proportional to v. but v is arbitrary, so it can be made arbitrary small.

the case of positive order of singularity is a little more complicated. in general, we have

(d) = (d) + 1

(4.1.11)

because the operation of derivation, increases the order of singularity. however, this is not the
rule, and there are cases when this do not happen i.e. we have

(d) < (d) + 1.

(4.1.12)

this is exactly the case when anomalies do appear and we have their explicit expression

given in the following proposition:

proposition 4.5 in the conditions described in the statement of the proposition 4.3, suppose
that we have   (d) > 0, 0  (d) > 0 and
0 <  + 1. then, if we apply the minimal
distributions splitting described by prop. 4.3 to d and d, the anomaly is given by the following
formula for p  +

n (0)  

n (0)

a(p) =

1

2izr

dt(cid:18) 1

t+2 + . . . +

1

t0+2(cid:19) d(tp)

(4.1.13)

(and for arbitrary p by analytic continuation.) the anomaly given above is a polynomial in p
having only the terms with the degree of homogeneity between  and 0.

remark 4.6 one can see that what was called in [12], [13] and in the previous section, the
canonical splitting, is in fact, the minimal central solution of the causal splitting problem.

24

4.2 the derivation of the anomaly

in this section we will analyze the possible obstructions to factorization of the s-matrix in
the third order of the perturbation theory. in principle, there is no dierence with respect to
the preceding section. nevertheless, the details of distribution splitting are considerably more
more complicated and the same is true for the whole combinatorial argument. as before, we
will investigate the action of the brst operator dq on the third order commutator

where

d3(x, y; z) = a(x, y; z)  r(x, y; z)

a(x, y; z)  t1(z)t 2(x, y)  t2(x, z)t 1(y)  t2(y, z)t 1(x),
r(x, y; z)  t 2(x, y)t1(z)  t 1(y)t2(x, z)  t 1(x)t2(y, z);

(4.2.1)

(4.2.2)

(4.2.3)

here we have put, for simplicity: t2  t c
2 ,
as in the case of the second order factorization condition, the eect of applying the brst
operator on the third order commutator is a total divergence expression. this follows easily
from the denitions given above and formul (3.1.11) and a similar one for the second order
chronological products (3.2.40) + (3.2.41). in fact, a much more convenient expression can be
found:

t 2  t

c
2.

proposition 4.7 there exists a formula of the following type:

dqd3(x, z; y) = i


x d

1 (x, y; z) + i


y d

2 (x, y; z) + i


z d

3 (x, y; z)

(4.2.4)

where the distributions d

i (x, y; z),

i = 1, 2, 3 have causal support, thats it we have

supp(d

i (x, y; z))  +

2 (0)  

2 (0).

proof:
we apply to the equations (4.2.2) and (4.2.3) the brst operator and use the formul
i =

(3.1.11) and (3.2.40). we get the following expressions for the distributions d
1, 2, 3 :

i (x, y; z),

d
1 (x, y; z) = [t1(z), t

d
2 (x, y; z) = [t1(z), t
3 (x, y; z) = [t

1 (x, y)]  [t 
2 (x, y)]  [t 2(x, z), t

1 (z), t 2(x, y)]  [t

1 (y)]  [t 
2 (x, z), t 1(y)]  [t 


1 (x)],
1 (y, z), t 1(x)],
2 (y, z), t 1(x)].

(4.2.5)

now the support properties can be proved using the causal support properties exhibited in

the proposition 3.9 and applying some ideas from [11] (cid:4)

i (x, y; z),

to proceed further, we need some alternative expressions for the distributions with causal
support d
i = 1, 2, 3. the idea is that in the preceding expressions there are two
types of terms: ones with a factor of the type (x  y) and the others.
it is convenient to
separate them. it is also convenient to eliminate completely the antichronological products.
the result is the following one:

25

proposition 4.8 the following formul are true:

1 (x, y; z) = [r0,

1 (x, z), t1(y)] + [t 

1 (x, y), t1(z)]  [r0,

1 (z, x), t1(y)]  [r0,

2 (x, y; z) = d

2(x, y), t 

(4.2.6)

now we present the main result.

theorem 4.9 the distribution t3(x, y, z) induces (in the adiabatic limit) an well dened ex-
pression on the (physical) factor space if and only if, beside the conditions from the statement
of theorem 2.2, we also have the following set of supplementary conditions:

(i) we have either: (a) vabc 6 0; or (b) vabc = aabc = 0. here the expressions vabc and aabc

have been dened in the introduction by the formul:

and respectively

vabc  x1,2,3=

aabc  x1,2,3=

(ii) we have the identity:

(1 + 12 + 23 + 31) t r (t1

a [t2

b , t3

c ])

(1 + 2 + 3 + 123) t r (t1

a {t2

ad(cid:1) = 0.

(4.2.7)

(4.2.8)

(4.2.9)

proof:
the proof is extremely long and intricate, although the idea is, basically simple: we have
to split causally the equality (4.2.4) and see if there are some obstructions to this process. the
justication of this procedure can be found in the previous two papers dedicated to this topics
and references quoted there. to gain some simplicity, we divide it in a number of steps.

(i) if we group linear independent wick monomials, then we can write the rst distribution

from (4.2.6) as follows:

(4.2.12)

(4.2.13)

here the (numerical) distributions of the type d must have also causal support. in fact, the
general structure of these distributions is:

here the distributions d#

d(x, y; z) =x d#
i (x  y),

1 (x  y)d#

2 (x  z)d#
i = 1, 2, 3 can be of the type

3 (y  z).

with the elds (x) as factors in t 
1 (x) and (y), (resp. (z)) as factors in t1(y) (resp. t1(z));
by the sign # we indicate that some of the distributions d(+) from above must be substituted
by the corresponding advanced or retarded parts: dadv(ret).

in fact, the rules of these substitutions are the following: one applies wick theorem to the

expression

x1(x, y, z)  t 

1 (x)t1(y)t1(z)

(4.2.14)

and keeps only the terms where there are eective wick contractions. next, one one has to
make the substitutions indicated above in some factors. after inspecting the expression of d

from the preceding proposition, we arrive quite naturally at a formula of the type:

(4.2.15)

then it can be easily seen that one can causally decompose the distribution dqd

the advanced part of

x a

1a(x, y; z) is

so, if (4.2.17) can be fullled, there will be no anomalies coming from the rst piece of

dqd3.

comparing to the results of the preceding subsection, we start to investigate, in our par-

ticular case, the possibility of appearance of anomalies.

(ii) it is important to establish a standard procedure of splitting of the distributions. we
will do this below in such a way that we will be able to apply the propositions 4.2 and 4.3 from
the preceding subsection. we have to circumvent somehow the possibility that the conditions
of the proposition 4.3 are not met. this is particularly important because if there are null-
mass particles in the theory, some of the distributions appearing in the expression dqd3 will
certainly not full this requirements; more precisely the point 0 will be included, in general, in
the spectrum of the fourier transform of some of these distributions. although it is possible
to modify the formula from prop. 4.3 such that these cases are also covered (see [9]), this
modication makes the analysis more complicated that it already is! we will prefer a dierent
trick.

let us consider a typical distribution (4.2.15) and exhibit the dependence on the masses:
d(1, . . . , l). the problems are created by those distributions for which some of the parameters
1, . . . , l can be null. we rst can prove that the preceding distribution admits a taylor
expansion with rest:

d(1, . . . , l) = d(, . . . , ) +x(i  )

(, . . . , ) + . . .

1

+

k!x(i1  )   (ik  )

i1 . . . ik

(, . . . , ) + rk+1(1, . . . , l)

(4.2.19)

where the last contribution is the taylor rest and  > 0 is an arbitrary parameter. now it is
not dicult to see that for expressions of the type (4.2.15) the preceding series has the following
nice properties:

- every term in the sum has the order of singularity with at least one unit less than the
preceding term. this means that is we take k suciently large we can make the order of
singularity of the taylor rest  2;
- if the distribution d has causal support, then every term in the series has also causal
support; indeed the operations derivation and of xing the parameters to the value  cannot
destroy the support properties. in fact the structure of the type (4.2.15) is conserved by this
operations;

- all the terms in (4.2.19), except the last one, have in the momentum space the following

structure (we use the notation p  p1 + p2):
1)g1 + (p2

(p2

1  2

2  2

2)g2 + (p 2  2

3)g3

(4.2.20)

with i > 0,

i = 1, 2, 3. in particular, these terms meet the conditions of proposition 4.5.

as a consequence, we adopt the following standard procedure of splitting distributions of
the type (4.2.15): for all terms of the series (4.2.19) we apply proposition 4.5 and for the taylor

28

rest we apply proposition 4.4. as a consequence of prop 4.4 the taylor rest does not produce
anomalies. the nice thing about this recipe is that one can compute the anomalies for the rst
k terms of (4.2.19) using the minimal central decomposition formula.

(iii) now we apply the splitting procedure described above and we have two cases.
(i) the rst one is given by the rst terms of the formula (4.2.11) i.e. the distributions do
not carry the index ; the index appears in the corresponding wick monomial. it is not hard
to see that in this case we have:

(cid:18) d

x(cid:19) = (d) + 1;

(4.2.21)

as a consequence, proposition 4.5 shows that these terms do not produce anomalies.

(ii) the second case corresponds to the second term in (4.2.11) and we have distributions

carrying the index . there are two subcases:

(a) the index  comes from a derivative
in this case one investigates a typical term of (4.2.15); the fourier transform of such a term

has the structure

or

d(p1, p2) = const.zr4

r d1(r) d2(p1  r) d3(p2 + r)

d(p1, p2) = const.zr4

1  r) d1(r) d2(p1  r) d3(p2 + r).
(p

one investigates now if it is possible that ( d

x ) < (d) + 1. by applying the derivation,
in the preceding formul we get r 7 p1  r and respectively p
1  p1  r so the order
of singularity increases, except for the case when the variable r is xed in the rst (resp. the
second) case to 0 (resp. to p1) i.e we have d1(r)  (r) (resp. d2(s)  (s)). but it is easy to
see that this cannot happen in all terms appearing into formul of the type (4.2.15). so, this
case does not produce anomalies.

1  r 7 p2

(b) the index  comes from a matrix 
in this case, we can have two subcases:
(b1) d  () f
this case does not lead to anomalies, as in case (a) above.
(b2) d = t r () f with  a matrix depending on (p1, p2).
in this case we have

d = t r (  p1) f

so the term of maximal degree in p can cancel from purely algebraic reasons, thats it by taking
of the trace.

we conclude that there are two type of terms which can produce anomalies:
(a) those of the type (b2) from above in which a trace is present;
(b) those coming from the delta terms appearing in the formula (4.2.6). these terms have
been analyzed previously in [18] and we will mention briey the outcome using our methods,
at the very end of the proof.

29

(iv) we concentrate now on the anomalies of origin (a). there are four types of terms x 
1

(see (4.2.14)) which can produce such an anomaly; let us list them:

x 

a (x)ab(y)j

1 (x, y; z) = ua(x)j
x 
2 (x, y; z) = ua(x)j
x 
3 (x, y; z) = ua(x)j
x 
4 (x, y; z) = ua(x)j

b (y)ac(z)j

c (z),
a (x)b(y)jb(y)c(z)jc(z),
a (x)ab(y)j
b (y)c(z)jc(z),
a (x)b(y)jb(y)ac(z)j
c (z).

(4.2.22)

in these terms we have to consider wick contractions leading to traces. it is not hard to

see that in this case the generic expression (4.2.11) becomes:

d

abc (x, y; z) : ua(x)ab(y)ac(z) : +d
1 (x, y; z) = d
abc(x, y; z) : ua(x)b(y)ac(z) : + d
d

abc(x, y; z) : ua(x)b(y)c(z) : +
abc(x, y; z) : ua(x)ab(y)c(z) : +

d
a(x, y; z)ua(x) +    (4.2.23)

where by    we mean the terms which cannot produce anomalies.
according to the general strategy developed so far, we have to compute explicitly the ve
types of distributions appearing in this formula and investigate if, after applying the operator

x it is possible that the order singularity does not increase by an unit, as we would normally
expect. if we index the two chiral pieces of the currents from the formul (3.2.33) and (3.2.34)
by appointing an  which can take the values + or , then it is clear that every one of the
operators x 
where
i
we have denoted ()  (1, 2, 3). moreover, every operator of the type x ()
is a sum of
eight terms because we have in every chiral component we have a vector piece coming from
the factor 1
25. so, in fact we have a further
decomposition

listed above are, in fact a sum of eight contributions: x 

2 and an axial piece coming from the piece 1

i = p() x ()

i

i

x ()

i = x ()

i(v v v ) + x ()

i(v aa) +    x ()

i(aaa).

so, all in all, every distribution appearing into the formula (4.2.23) is formed of 4 4 4 pieces.
we investigate a typical piece. from the generic formula (4.2.15) one can nd, paying attention
to the signs appearing in wick theorem for fermions:

the piece d;()

abc;v aa is obtained by making   25 and   35, etc. it is convenient
abc;v and the rest

to group all the terms in which there remains no 5 factor into a vector part d
into an axial part d

abc;a.

next, one should perform a fourier transform of the distribution given above and after that

construct the the taylor series (4.2.19). we consider the rst term of the series

f 
abc  d

abc (m, . . . , m)

i.e. we put all the fermion masses equal to a certain positive value m.

after some very tedious computations the following result is obtained:

f 
abc (p1, p2) =

f 
abc(i)(p1, p2)

xi=1

(4.2.25)

(4.2.26)

where the three terms correspond to the three pieces of the generic expression (4.2.20). the
structure of these components is given below:

abc;(3)(p1, p2) (4.2.29)

where pi are some polynomials having terms of third order and of rst order degree in the
variables r, p1 and p2.

in particular, they have dierent support properties, so one can compute the order of sin-
gularity of the preceding distribution by studying the three terms individually and applying

31

lemma 4.1. next, we can easily establish that the order of singularity of these terms is given
by the highest power part of the polynomials. so, we have after some computations that:

f 
abc(i)(p1, p2) = vabc f 

abc(i)(v )(p1, p2) + aabc f 

abc(i)(a)(p1, p2) +   

(4.2.30)

here the expression vabc and aabc have been dened by the formul (4.2.7) and (4.2.8); by

the dots we understand contributions with lower order of singularity.

the vector and axial parts from this formula are induced by the corresponding decomposi-

tion of the polynomials from (4.2.27)-(4.2.29) into a vector and a axial part:

p 
abc(i) = p 

abc(i)(v ) + p 

abc(i)(a),

i = 1, 2, 3.

(4.2.31)

we give only the expression for i = 3.

p 
abc(3)(v ) = vabct r( )(r  p1)r(r + p2)

and

(4.2.32)

(4.2.33)

p 
abc(3)(a) = aabct r(5 )(r  p1)r(r + p2) .

now it is clear that we must study the order of singularity of distributions of the following

type:

and

f 

3(v )(p1, p2) =zr4
dr{[(r0 + p10)(r0 + p20)  (r0  p10)(r0  p20)]
((r  p1)2  m 2)((r + p2)2  m 2)t r( )(r  p1)r(r + p2)
r2  m 2  ir0

1

f 

3(a)(p1, p2) =zr4

dr{[(r0 + p10)(r0 + p20)  (r0  p10)(r0  p20)]
((r  p1)2  m 2)((r + p2)2  m 2)t r(5 )(r  p1)r(r + p2)
.
r2  m 2  ir0

1

(4.2.34)

(4.2.35)

then we should contract them with p1 and see what happens with the order of singularity.

the results are obtain by elementary computations. we have:

( f 

3(v )) = ( f 

3(a)) = 1.

now we turn to the distributions
f 
3(v )(p1, p2)  p1 f 

f 
3(a)(p1, p2)  p1 f 
and nd that something interesting, nally happens. indeed we have:

3(v )(p1, p2),

3(a)(p1, p2)

( f 

3(v )) = ( f 

3(v )) + 1

32

(4.2.36)

(4.2.37)

(4.2.38)

but

the same analysis goes through for the other two terms from the formula (4.2.26). so,

( f 

3(a)) = ( f 

3(a)).

(4.2.39)

nally we obtain two distinct cases:

(a) vabc 6 0
in this case we have

( f 

abc) = ( f 

abc ) + 1

(4.2.40)

and the distributions do not produce anomalies when we split them causally.

(b) vabc = 0
we have two subcases:
(b1) aabc 6 0
in this case an anomaly can appear. the explicit computation uses the proposition 4.5 and
goes as in [17].
in particular, only the last term of the expression (4.2.26) gives something
non-trivial and one obtains:

a
abc =

1
6i

aabcp1p2.

(4.2.41)

(b2) aabc = 0

in this case the distribution f 

abc vanishes and from the proposition 4.5 it follows that the
anomaly must be a constant (independent of p1 and p2). we start again from the generic ex-
pression (4.2.24) for the distribution d
abc and observe from considerations of lorentz invariance
the generic expression (4.5) of the anomaly that we must have

a = k0p1p2 + k1p
1p

1 + k2p

2p

2 + k3p

2 + k4p

(4.2.42)

with ki functions of the invariants p2
1,
be in fact equal to 0.

2 and p 2. it is clear now that these functions has to
p2

we must consider now the next term in the taylor series (4.2.19) for the distribution d
abc .
it is easy to prove that this term can have the order of singularity at most 0 so it can produce
an anomaly which is a constant. then, the same reasoning as before applies and there are no
anomalies. the third term of the taylor series can be also be analyzed and, again, it does not
produce anomalies. in conclusion, the distribution d
abc can produce anomalies only in the case
vabc = 0, aabc 6 0.
abc and
observe that this distribution can be obtained from d
abc by making some simple transformations:
,   1,
c . but in this case the axial part of this distribution will be
null because t r(5) = 0 so, repeating the same argument as before, we conclude that the
second term from (4.2.23) does not produces anomalies.

we now analyze the other distributions from the expression (4.2.23). we begin with d

t2
b  s2

c  s3

b and t3

the next two terms of the formula (4.2.23) have the structure (4.2.27)-(4.2.29) but the poly-
nomials are of degree 2. this means that these distributions can have the order of singularity
at most 0. but in this case, the anomaly must be a constant. on the other hand, a direct
inspection of the anomaly, starting from the proposition 4.5 and using consideration of lorentz
covariance, leads to a generic form of the anomaly:

1l1 + p

2l2

a = p
33

where li are functions of the invariants p2
1,
functions has to be in fact equal to 0.

2 and p 2. as before, it is clear that these
p2

finally, we analyze the last contribution from (4.2.23) i.e. the distribution d

a. first, we
prove as before that the axial part is 0. next, we observe from lorentz covariance arguments
that we must have

d
a(p1, p2) = p

1a1 + p

2a2

so

this implies that we have (da) = (d

a) + 1 and, according to prop. 4.5, there are no

da(p1, p2)  p1 d

a(p1, p2) = p2

1a1 + p1  p2a2.

anomalies.

so, we can summarize the result of the analysis for the rst term d

1 from the formula
(4.2.6) as follows: the anomalies can appear only in the case vabc = 0, aabc 6 0 and in this
case, the explicit expression in the coordinates space is

aabc(x  z)(y  z) : ua(x)
which is not a coboundary, as can be easily proved.

a = 

i
6


x ab(x)


x ac(x) :

(4.2.43)

it is easy to prove that the second term from the formula (4.2.6) produces the same anomaly.
an important dierence comes in the analysis of the last term of (4.2.6). we follow the
same line as before, and get distributions of the type (4.2.34) and (4.2.35). but now we must
contract these distributions with p because the distribution d
3 is dierentiated with respect
to z. it is easy to prove that in this case the axial part is null, so there are no anomalies.

and we obtain the rst condition from the statement of the theorem.

in conclusion, we can have only the anomaly (4.2.43) in the conditions vabc = 0, aabc 6 0
(v) we still have to investigate the possible anomalies coming from the delta terms from
the expressions (4.2.6) d
i . as we have said before, these terms have been analyzed in [18].
we present here briey the analysis of these terms using our technology and we nd a new
condition of consistency which seems to be missing in this references. for i = 1 only the term
i(yz)[t 
1 (x), l(y)] can produce anomalies. the contribution corresponding to i = 2, 3 triples
this possible anomaly. one can compute the commutator and select the terms which will lead,
in principle, to an anomaly. we get:

for mb = mc = 0. the symmetry in b and c is obvious.

we analyze these possible anomalies in detail.
 in [8] it is proved that the a1 = 0 due to the jacobi identity.
 one can also show, using the identity (2.2.22) that a2 + a3 = 0.
 next, we try to write the anomaly a4 as a coboundary: dql(x). we should take

l(x) = g(9)

acf gh : a(x)c(x)f (x)g(x)h(x) :

(4.2.55)

where we can suppose that the constants g(9)
masses. we obtain the relation:

consistency relation is veried:

acf gh if the following

hbcg(8)

(4.2.57)

using the denition (2.2.37) of the expression g(8)
elementary that this relation is identically veried.

abde and the identity (2.2.22) one can show

(b) mc = 0
in this case we get the condition

which is again, an identity.

 similarly, we try to write the anomaly a5 as the coboundary of

acef gh : a(x)c(x)e(x)f (x)g(x)h(x) :

(4.2.58)

(4.2.59)

(4.2.60)

as above, one can show that for mc 6= 0 we obtain a consistent denition of the coecients
g(10)
acef gh and for mc = 0 we get an identity.

36

 we try to write the anomaly a6 as a coboundary dql(x) with

l(x) =: a(x)b(x)c(x) :: a(x)(cabc1 + c
where we can suppose that the expressions cabc and c
abc are completely symmetric and
moreover, we can suppose that they are zero for ma = mb = mc = 0. we obtain the
following equations:

abc5)abb(x) :

(4.2.61)

3imacabc = tabc,

3imac

abc = t

abc.

(4.2.62)

as before, we have two cases:
(a) ma 6= 0
in this case, we can solve the preceding equations for the expressions cabc and c
following consistency equations are true

abc if the

mbtabc = a  b, mbt

abc = a  b.

(4.2.63)

as in the preceding section (see formula (3.1.18), it is convenient to work with chiral
components:

and, because

abc) = t

we have only the consistency condition:

mbt+

abc = a  b.

(4.2.64)

(4.2.65)

(4.2.66)

after some work, using the relations (2.2.22), (2.2.29), (2.2.30), the denitions of the
expressions t
a and their representation property (3.2.7) we get from here the relation
(4.2.9) from the statement.

(b) ma = 0
in this case, we also use (2.2.33) and obtain an identity.

in the end, we get the conditions from the statement. (cid:4)

we end with the following proposition:

proposition 4.10 the expression vabc has the alternative expression

vabc = ifbcdt r(tatd + t

at

d).

(4.2.67)

in particular, there exist lie groups for which this tensor is not identically null.

remark 4.11 recently [14] a new method was proposed to solve problems of consistency as the
ones appearing in our paper. instead of imposing a factorisation condition of the type (2.2.9)
(or its innitesimal version (2.2.10)) one imposes a quantum analogue of the noether conser-
vation law of a certain current. presumably, this starting points are equivalent and they should
lead to the same sets of consistency conditions. this point deserves further investigations.

4.3 the standard model
we remind the notations from [13]. the lie algebra is in this case su(2)u(1) and the standard
basis xa,

a = 0, 1, 2, 3 has the usual commutation relations

[xa, xb] = abcxc,

a, b = 1, 2, 3,

[x0, xa] = 0,

a = 1, 2, 3.

(4.3.1)

in the new basis ya,

a = 0, 1, 2, 3 dened by

ya = g xa,

a = 1, 2, y3 = g cos x3+g sin x0,

y0 = g sin x3g cos x0. (4.3.2)
(here the angle , determined by the condition cos  > 0 is the weinberg angle and the constants
g and g are real with g > 0) the structure constants are:

f210 = g sin ,

f321 = g cos ,

f310 = 0,

f320 = 0

(4.3.3)

and the rest of the constants are determined by antisymmetry. the choice of the masses is:

m0 = 0, ma 6= 0,

a = 1, 2, 3

(the particles created by a
heavy bosons).

0 being the photons and the particles created by a
a,

in [13] we have found out the following result:

theorem 4.12 in the standard model, the following relations are true:

(a) the masses of the heavy bosons are constrained by:

(4.3.4)

a = 1, 2, 3

(b) the constants f 

abc are completely determined by the antisymmetry property (2.2.20) and:

m1 = m2 = m3cos ;

the components 2 (resp. 1) correspond to the electron (resp. the electronic neutrino)

here i are the pauli matrices. the representation property (3.2.7) is fullled for any matrix
y. however, we have the following elementary result:

proposition 4.13 the interaction between the dirac eld of the electron 2 and the electro-
magnetic eld a

(here e is the electron charge) i

moreover, the expression (3.2.9) is zero in this case.

proof:
one uses the relations (3.1.19) for a = 1, 2, 3 and obtains the expressions for s+
a ,

a = 1, 2, 3.

next, we easily see that the relation (4.2.9) is, in this case

a = if

a = 1, 2, 3.

(4.3.14)

this equation gives immediately the expression for s+
0 .
one can check now that the relations (3.2.8) are identically veried also for a, b = 1, 2, 3 so

we have lmatter = 0. (cid:4)

one can check that in this way the usual standard model is obtain.
