(for reviews see .) particular, focused systems coincident d-branes anti-d-branes. basic idea whereas system coincident d-branes (or anti-d-branes) would stable supersymmetric (bps) conguration, system branes anti-branes not. separately preserves half supersymmetries ambient background, dierent halves preserved case, present, unbroken supersymmetry. one manifestation fact excitation spectrum open strings connecting dp-branes dp-branes reversed gso projection compared ones connecting dp-branes dp-branes (or dp-branes dp- branes). results tachyon elds world volume, signal instability. tachyon elds roll minimum higgs-like manner represents annihilation branes anti-branes. specic, consider system n dp-branes n dp-branes coincident (p + 1)-dimensional hyperplanes embedded r10. ground state dp - dp open strings gives u(n) gauge elds dp - dp open strings give u(n ) gauge elds a. dp - dp open strings, hand, give bifundamental (n, n ) tachyon . elds written together superconnection = ! . (1) one issue whether branes anti-branes completely annihilate. criterion, basically, whether total d-brane charge (which conserved) zero not. cancelling dp-brane charge requires n = n , course, whole story. also necessary gauge bundles e e (associated branes anti-branes) topologically equivalent, e e . otherwise, lower-dimension d- brane charge, d-brane would survive. illustrate consider case one d2-brane one d2-brane, wrapped 2, coincident dimensions. wess-zumino term d2-brane world-volume action contains z (cef )3 =zrt 2 (c3 + c1 f ), (2) cs rr potentials. formula see magnetic ux rt 2 f source c1, means carries d0-brane charge. thus, example, d2-brane ux giving one unit d0-brane charge d2-brane ux, annihilation leaves d0-brane d2 + d2 d0. 1 (3) world-volume theory describes coincident dp + dp system formulated terms gauge elds tachyons, one imagines modes integrated out. hard make explicit controlled manner, since tachyon mass generally string scale. thus discussion follows necessarily somewhat qualitative heuristic. advantage physical intuitive, however. analyses better mathematical control lead conclusions. one approach use conformal eld theory methods, described sens lecture. another one use boundary-state techniques, described gaberdiels lecture. case, working gauge elds tachyons, world-volume theory tachyon potential v (t ), must invariant u(n) u(n ) gauge symmetry. moreover, n = n , sen argues minima correspond pure vacuum. locus minima, gauge equivalent, given = t0 u, t0 xed positive real number u arbitrary constant element u(n). minimum, tachyon condensation energy exactly cancel energy d-branes here, tdp tension single dp-brane. thus e e = t0 u, dp + dp system equivalent pure vacuum. happens u(n) gauge groups v (t0 u) + 2ntdp = 0. (4) completely understood. let us take n = n = 1 consider kink conguration tachyon eld . complex, let us consider im = 0 = t0 tanh(x/a), x one cartesian coordinates branes. describes solitonic d(p 1)-brane thickness concentrated vicinity x = 0. (the precise functional form important.) since vacuum manifold |t| = t0 circle, 0(s 1) trivial, d-brane real tachyon world volume unstable. well, since stable d-branes type ii theories believed known, one list. fact, unstable d-branes constructed wrong values p type ii theories. stable d-branes exist p = even iia theory p = odd iib theory. unstable ones occur values p. sen demonstrated unstable d-branes useful analyzing certain issues. purpose describing set stage analogous construction, appear later. 2 non-bps type d0-branes let review one sens constructions non-bps stable d0-brane type superstring theory. construction consider terms tachyon kink d- string anti-d-string conguration. recall type d-string actually spin (32)/z2 2 heterotic string continued strong coupling. continuation reliable, string bps. system n coincident strings world volume gauge group o(n). understood subgroup u(n) set type iib d-strings survives orientifold projection. particular, single d-string group o(1) = z2. even though gauge elds case, group matters. particular, d-string wrapped circular spatial dimension possible wilson lines w = 1. 32 left-moving fermion elds d-string world-sheet arise zero modes d1 - d9 open strings. wrapped circular dimension, wilson line encodes periodicity a(x + 2r) = w a(x). (5) thus, w = 1, zero modes, satisfy cliord algebra, d-string quantum states gauge group spinors (with 215 components). consider d1 + d1 pair wrapped circle. one string w = 1 one w = 1, overall two-particle state gauge group spinor. since gauge group broken, implies complete annihilation possible. tachyonic ground state open string connecting d-string anti-d-string real case. case opposite wilson lines considering, tachyon eld antiperiodic. thus fourier series expansion tn+1/2(t) exp"i n + 1/2 r ! x# . =xn mass tn+1/2, considered particle 9d, 2 n+1/2 = (n + 1/2)2/r2 1/2. (6) (7) 1/2 term tachyonic mass-squared value (in string units) 10d, usual rns string. formula see r < 1/2, tachyonic instability wrapped d1 + d1 pair annihilate. r > 1/2, hand, t1/2 (and possibly modes) tachyonic. means strings annihilate. results stable non-bps d0-brane, gauge group spinor. carries conserved z2 charge. case, z2 corresponds two conjugacy classes spin (32)/z2. r = rc = 1/2 small string coupling constant g md0 2 2rc td1 = 2/g. (8) sen argued leading small g value type 1 d0-brane mass r, though higher-order corrections. usual 1/g factor characteristic d-branes. curiously, mass diers type iia d0-brane factor 3 2 (in leading order). s-dual heterotic theory lightest gauge group spinor occurs rst excited level perturbative spectrum. presumably, non-bps d0-brane type state continued strong coupling. 3 k-theory classication d-branes recall dp + dp system characterized pair vector bundles (e, e ) tachyon , section e e . complete annihilation possible e e . requires n = n , particular. following earlier suggestion moore minasian {$9710230$}, witten argued equivalence classes pairs (e, e ) related brane annihilation creation correspond k-theory classes {$9810188$}. mathematical objects correspond conserved d-brane charges. example, d-brane charges type iib theory r10 given k(s 9p) =( z p = odd p = even 0 . (9) accounts rr charges stable type iib d-branes. note unstable d-branes (for p = even) carry conserved charges show classication. case type theory, e o(n + 32) bundle e o(n) bundle, total rr 9-brane charge 32. relevant k-theory groups r10 case results follows: denoted gko(s 9p), explained witten. gko(s 9p) = z p = 1, 5, 9 gko(s 9p) = z2 p = 1, 0, 7, 8 p = 1 corresponds type d-instanton, p = 0 corresponds non- bps d0-brane, discussed. cases p = 7, 8 additional non-bps classify charges three kinds bps dp-branes type i. d-branes proposed witten. gko(s 9p) = 0 p = 2, 3, 4, 6 conserved d-brane charges cases. 4 issues concerning type d8-brane k theory classication type d-branes, summarized, suggests two new d-branes discussed previously: d7 d8, supposed carry conserved z2 charge. 4 noted nal paragraph ref. {$9903123$}, tachyon spectrum d7 - d9 d8 - d9 open strings. means world volume d7-brane d8-brane contains 32 tachyon elds. therefore neither d-branes stable. raises question happens conserved z2 charge dissolve background d9-branes. comments follow arose discussions oren bergman ashoke sen, well correspondence edward witten. discuss d8- brane, though d7-brane story likely similar. witten argued support d8-brane follows: type d-instanton implies two dierent vacua, distinguished sign instanton amplitudes. z2 analog angle qcd. one expect domain wall separating two vacua d8-brane. sign change instanton amplitudes would mean d-instanton em dual d8-brane. investigations support picture carried gukov {$9901042$}. k-theory analysis incorporates bott periodicity. suggests type d8- brane features common type d0-brane, discussed section 2. course, bott periodicity taken cum grano salis, since total spacetime dimension ten. construction type d0-brane described involved wrapping d- strings circle, convenient regulator. however, one might argue localized d8-brane exist circle (in direction normal brane), since would require identifying two distinct vacua. therefore analyze situation uncompactied r10. d0-brane could presented without involving compactication. case, considering r limit construction section 2, see d0-brane described tachyonic kink system consisting innite straight d-string coincident anti-d-string. kink conguration would exactly described type ii theories section 1. however, unlike type ii examples, tachyon eld real case, potential v (t ) even function z2 gauge symmetries. kink conguration describing d0-brane topologically stable case vacuum manifold 0 (t = t0) 0(s 0) = z2. let us try construct d8-brane d9-branes analogous manner. one essential dierence total d9-brane charge must 32. therefore simplest analog consider 33 d9-branes one d9-brane lling entire r10 spacetime. case open strings connecting d9 d9-branes give 33 real tachyon elds fundamental representation so(33). (it doesnt matter whether one uses o(n) so(n) present setting.) potential v (t ) must so(33) symmetry therefore vacuum manifold given |t | = t0, describes 32. 5 manifold connected, topologically stable kink. situation encountered unstable type ii d-branes section 1. case 32 directions instability, one expects nd 32 tachyon elds d8-brane world volume. agrees conclusion ref. {$9903123$}, identied modes d8 - d9 open strings. make this? think clear d8-brane unstable, least unless something done stabilize it. still, may interesting consider setting d8-brane conguration exploring implies. wont present details reasoning here, appears vacua two sides d8-brane distinguished chirality gauge group spinors. course, d8-brane decays, eventually leaving uniform type vacuum, one chirality remain. may sound paradoxical, possible gauge group broken inside d8-brane. conclusion, k-theory classies d-brane charges. however, high dimension non-bps d-branes sometimes destabilized tachyonic modes open strings connecting background spacetime lling d-branes. acknowledgments grateful oren bergman, ashoke sen, edward witten helpful discussions suggestions. 6
