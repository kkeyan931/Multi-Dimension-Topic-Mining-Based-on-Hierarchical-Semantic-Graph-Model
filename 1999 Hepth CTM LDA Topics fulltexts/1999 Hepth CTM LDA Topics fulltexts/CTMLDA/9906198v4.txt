we present a strong evidence for the magnetic connement in qcd by demonstrating that the one
loop eective action of su (2) qcd induces a dynamical symmetry breaking thorugh the monopole
condensation, which could induce the dual meissner eect and guarantee the connement of color
in the non-abelian gauge theory. the result is obtained by separating the topological degrees which
describes the non-abelian monopoles from the dynamical degrees of the potential, and integrating
out all the dynamical degrees of qcd.

one of the most outstanding problems in theoretical
physics is the connement problem in qcd. it has long
been argued that the monopole condensation could ex-
plain the connement of color through the dual meissner
eect [1,2].
indeed, if one assumes the monopole con-
densation, one could easily argue that the ensuing dual
meissner eect guarantees the connement [3,4]. but so
far there has not been a satisfactory proof how the de-
sired monopole condensation could take place in qcd.
in this direction, however, there has been a remarkable
progress in the lattice simulation during the last decade.
in fact the recent numerical simulation has provided an
unmistakable evidence which supports the idea of the
magnetic connement through the monopole condensa-
tion [5,6]. the purpose of this letter is to establish
the magnetic connement in qcd from the rst prin-
ciples. utilizing the parameterization of the gauge po-
tential which emphasizes its topological character we es-
tablish the monopole condensation of vacuum in qcd in
one loop approximation, after integrating out all the dy-
namical degrees of the non-abelian potential. the result
conrms that the vacuum condensation naturally gener-
ates the mass gap necessary for the dual meissner eect.
this demonstrates the existence of a dynamical symme-
try breaking mechanism which establishes the magnetic
connement in qcd.

to prove the magnetic connement it is instructive
for us to remember how the magnetic ux is conned
in the superconductor through the meissner eect.
in
the macroscopic ginzburg-landau description of super
conductivity the meissner eect is triggered by the mass
term of the electromagnetic potential, which determines
the penetration (connement) scale of the magnetic ux.
in the microscopic bcs description, this eective mass
is generated by the electron-pair (the cooper pair) con-
densation. this suggests that, for the connement of
the color electric ux, one need the condensation of the
monopoles. equivalently, in the dual ginzburg-landau

description, one need the dynamical generation of the ef-
fective mass for the monopole potential. to demonstrate
this one must rst identify the monopole potential, and
separate it from the generic qcd connection, in a gauge
independent manner. this can be done with the abelian
projection [2,3], which provides us a natural reparame-
terization of the non-abelian connection in terms of the
dual potential of the maximal abelian subgroup h of
the gauge group g and the gauge covariant vector eld
of the remaining g/h degrees. with this separation one
can show that the monopole condensation takes place af-
ter one integrates out all the dynamical degrees of the
non-abelian gauge potential. this strongly endorses the
magnetic connement in qcd.

consider su (2) for simplicity. a natural way to iden-
tify the monopole potential is to introduce an isotriplet
unit vector eld n which selects the abelian direction
at each space-time point, and to decompose the connec-
tion into the abelian part which leaves n invariant and
the remaining part which forms a covariant vector eld
[2,3],

~a = a n 

1
g

n  n + ~x = a + ~x,

(n2 = 1, n  ~x = 0),

(1)

where a = n  ~a is the electric potential. notice
that the abelian projection a is precisely the connection
which leaves n invariant under the parallel transport,

d n =  n + g a  n = 0.

under the innitesimal gauge transformation

n = ~  n ,  ~a =

(3)

one has

(4)

notice that a still describes an su (2) connection which
enjoys the full su (2) gauge degrees of freedom. more
importantly, a retains the full topological characteris-
tics of the original non-abelian potential. clearly the
isolated singularities of n denes 2(s 2) which describes
the non-abelian monopoles. indeed a with a = 0 and
n = r describes precisely the wu-yang monopole [7,8].
besides, with the s 3 compactication of r3, n character-
izes the hopf invariant 3(s 2)  3(s 3) which describes
the topologically distinct vacuua [9,10].

the above discussion tells that a has a dual struc-
indeed the eld strength made of the restricted

ture.
potential is decomposed as

vector eld (the valence gluons) as its source [2,3]. ob-
viously the theory is invariant under the gauge transfor-
mation (3) of the active type. but notice that it is also
invariant under the following gauge transformation of the
passive type,

n = 0,

 ~a =

d~,

under which one has

a =

 ~x =

n  d~,

[d~  (n  d~)n].

 ~c = 0,

(11)

(12)

this gauge invariance of the passive type will be useful
in the following.

f = (f + h)n,
f = a   a,
g n  ( n   n) =  c   c,

h =  1

with this preparation we will now show that the eec-
tive theory of qcd, which one obtains after integrating
out all the dynamical degrees, can be written in one loop
approximation as

(5)

where c is the magnetic potential [2,3]. so one can
identify the non-abelian monopole potential by

~c =

n   n,

(6)

in terms of which the magnetic eld is expressed by

~h =  ~c   ~c + g ~c  ~c =

where h = q ~h 2

a nite constant. this is our main result, which provides
the desired monopole condensation of the vacuum.

which will be very useful for us in the following.

with (1) one has

we have to perform the functional integral with a proper

we choose the gauge xing condition

~f = f + d ~x  d ~x + g ~x  ~x,

(25)

with this the one loop contribution of the functional de-
terminants to the eective action can be written as

s = i ln det( d2 + 2gh)( d2 

2gh),

(19)

where now d acquires the following abelian form,

d =  + ig c.

notice that the reason for this simplication is precisely
because ~c originates from the abelian projection. with
this one can use the heat kernel method and the zeta
function regularization to calculate the functional deter-
minant. for the covariantly constant ~h we nd

l =

where now (s) is the riemanns zeta function. this
completes the derivation of the eective lagrangian (13).

clearly the eective action provides the following non-

trivial eective potential

which demonstrates that the magnetic condensation in-
deed generates the mass gap necessary for the dual meiss-
ner eect. obviously the mass scale sets the connement
scale.

to check the consistency of our result with the pertur-
bative qcd we now discuss the running coupling and the
renormalization. for this we dene the running coupling
g by

 2v

h 2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h= h

(27)

which exactly coincides with the well-known result [11].
in terms of the running coupling the renormalized poten-
tial is given by

vren =

and the callan-symanzik equation

 ~c(cid:17)vren = 0,

gives the following anomalous dimension for ~c,

(28)

(29)

(30)

this should be compared with that of the gluon eld in
perturbative qcd, ( ~a) = 5g2/242 for su (2).

notice that with the vacuum condensation the eec-

tive lagrangian can be approximated as

this is nothing but the skyrme-faddeev lagrangian
which allows the topological knot solitons as the classical
solutions [12]. it is truly remarkable that the skyrme-
faddeev lagrangian can be derived from the eective
lagrangian of qcd. our analysis establishes the deep
connection that exists between the generalized non-linear
sigma model of skyrme-faddeev type and qcd.

we conclude with the following remarks:

1) one might question (legitimately) the validity of the
one loop approximation, since in the infra-red limit the
non-perturbative eect is supposed to play the essential
role in qcd. our attitude on this issue is that qcd can
be viewed as the perturbative extension of the topological
eld theory described by the restricted qcd, so that the
non-perturbative eect in the low energy limit can eec-
tively be represented by the topological structure of the
restricted gauge theory. this is reasonable, because the
large scale structure of the monopole topology naturally
describes the long range behavior of the theory. in fact
one can show that it is the restricted connection that con-
tributes to the wilson loop integral, which provides the
connement criterion in qcd [13]. so we believe that
our classical monopole background automatically takes
care of the essential feature of the non-perturbative ef-
fect, which should make the one loop approximation re-
liable.
2) our vacuum looks very much like the old savvidy
vacuum [14]. but notice that, unlike the savvidy vac-
uum, ours is stable. in this connection we emphasize that
one must be very careful when one calculates the func-
tional determinant (19). naively det k contains nega-
tive eigenvalues whose eigenfunctions become tachyonic,
which cause an infra-red divergence. so one must exclude
these unphysical tachyonic modes with a proper infra-red
regularization, when one calculates the functional deter-
minant. only with the exclusion of the unphysical modes
one can obtain a consistent theory of qcd [15].
3) there have been two competing proposals for the cor-
rect mechanism of the connement in qcd, the one em-
phasizing the role of the instantons and the other em-
phasizing that of the monopoles. our analysis strongly
favors the monopoles as the physical source for the con-
nement.
it provides the correct dynamical symmetry
breaking, and generates the mass gap necessary for the
connement in the infra-red limit of qcd.

it must be clear from our analysis that the existence
of the magnetic condensation is a generic feature of the
non-abelian gauge theory. a more detailed discussion,
including vacuum stability and the the generalization of
our result to su (3), will be presented in a forthcoming
