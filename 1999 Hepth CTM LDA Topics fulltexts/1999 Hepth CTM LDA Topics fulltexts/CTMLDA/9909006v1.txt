we propose a 5-dimensional denition for the physical 4d-yangmills theory. the fth

dimension corresponds to the montecarlo time of numerical simulations of qcd4. the
5-dimensional theory is a well-dened topological quantum eld theory that can be renor-

malized at any given nite order of perturbation theory. the relation to non-perturbative

physics is obtained by expressing the theory on a lattice, a la wilson. the new elds that

must be introduced in the context of a topological yangmills theory have a simple lattice

expression. we present a 5-dimensional critical limit for physical correlation functions and

for dynamical auto-correlations, which allows new montecarlo algorithm based on the
time-step in lattice units given by  = g13/11
ve dimensions is such that no gribov ambiguity occurs. the weight is strictly positive,

in pure gluodynamics. the gauge-xing in

because all ghost elds have parabolic propagators and yield trivial determinants. we

indicate how our 5-dimensional description of the yangmills theory may be extended to

fermions.

1. introduction

the 4-dimensional yangmills theory seems to suer from logical contradictions. in

the continuum formulation, one has a gauge-xed brst invariant path integral, but one

has the famous gribov ambiguity for large gauge eld congurations [1][2]. one often

discards this problem, since the idea of dening the theory as a path integral of a gauge eld

can only be seriously advocated in perturbation theory or for semi-classical approximations.

in the lattice formulation, which is by construction valid non-pertubatively, one chooses as

variables the gauge group elements, but one has yet another contradiction. the way the

continuum theory is approached is unclear, and if one tries to do a local gauge-xing, the

partition function vanishes [3]. this question is also often discarded, since for computing

gauge-invariant quantities, one can factorize the volume of the gauge group that is nite

on the lattice.

it is however frustrating not to have continuum and lattice formulations which would

separately dene both gauge-invariant and gauge non-invariant sectors, with a brst sym-

metry controlling the correspondence of the theory to a physical sector, and with a natural

limit from the lattice to the continuum formulation.

in this article, we will show that, in order to reconcile the continuum and lattice

approaches, it is useful to dene the theory in a 5-dimensional space, such that the 4-

dimensional physical theory lives in a slice of this extended space. the theory that we

will consider passes the tests that are obviously needed: in the continuous formulation it

is perturbatively renormalizable by power counting without loosing its physical character,

(due to ward identities), and the gauge-xing is no longer subject to the gribov ambiguity;

in the lattice formulation, all elds that one considers in the continuum formulation take

their place, and one now obtains a formulation with a consistent gauge xing.

the fth-dimension will be the stochastic time that parisi and wu proposed long

time ago for stochastically quantizing the yangmills theory through a langevin equation

[4][5]. for reviews of stochastic quantization, see [6][7]. the 5-dimensional theory will be

a supersymmetric theory of the topological type, that we can express as a path integral

over 5-dimensional gauge elds for the continuum perturbative formulation, or as a lattice

gauge theory which now depends on elds of a topological eld theory. in one of the lattice

formulations that we will present, the stochastic time is discretized. in the 5-dimensional

critical limit controlled by g0  0, both the physical euclidean correlation lengths and the
dynamical monte carlo auto-correlation times diverge simultaneously. this allows new

algorithms.

1

the link between topological eld theory and stochastic quantization was rst ob-

served in [8]. the general idea is that the d + 1-dimensional supersymmetric formulation

of a d-dimensional quantum eld theory that is obtained by expressing the eld quanti-

zation by a langevin equation, involves the elds of a topological eld theory in d + 1

dimensions. then, supersymmetric cancellations wash away the detail of the theory in the

bulk, while the relevant aspects of the physical theory are retained in some boundary of

the d + 1-dimensional space.

moreover an extra gauge eld component is needed to enforce the 5-dimensional gauge

symmetry in the stochastic framework [9]. the latter can be identied as a potential

for a drift force along the gauge orbits of the original d-dimensional gauge theory, as

independently observed in [10][9][11]. a gauge-xing drift force for stochastic quantization

was actually introduced originally in [12], as a function of the 4-dimensional gauge elds a.
but the point is that, by promoting the potential for this force to a 5th eld component,

and by functionally integrating over all its possible values, [9], not only does one not alter

the physical physical sector of the theory, but one softens the gauge condition of the d-

dimensional quantum eld theory. this actually gives the desired result that the gribov

ambiguity losses is relevance as an obstacle for the gauge xing of the theory.

by postulating that qcd4 should be considered from a 5-dimensional point of view,
we will emphasize its relationship to a topological eld theory which establishes a pleasant

geometrical framework, both in the continuum and lattice descriptions.

renormalizability of stochastically quantized scalar 4 theory was demonstrated in

[13] using the brst operator which encodes the supersymmetry of the stochastic process.

renormalizability of the 5-dimensional formulation of gauge theory was demonstrated in

[14] using the brst operator for gauge invariance supplemented by graphical arguments.

in the present article we demonstrate renormalizability using the complete brst operator

that encodes both the supersymmetry of the stochastic process and the gauge symmetry

of the theory, consistent with parabolic propagation of all ghost elds.

the disappearance of the gribov ambiguity comes as an immediate consequence of

being in ve dimensions, in the context of renormalizable gauges (adapted to the power

counting of this dimension). we will check this result by the verication that the ghost

propagators cannot have zero modes. alternatively, the mathematically oriented reader

will notice that the argument of singer [2] for having a gribov copy phenomenon just

disapears because the stochastic processes is dened on an innite interval, even if we have

a compact 4-dimensional physical space.

2

the consistency of our approach is ensured by the topological invariance, dened

modulo ordinary gauge symmetry. we will also indicate that instantons in four dimensions

are replaced by 5-dimensional solitons, but we leave open the question of anomalies, which

is presumably connected to interesting 5-dimensional topological questions.

to make contact to non-perturbative physics, we will formulate the elds and the

symmetry in a 5-dimensional lattice formulation. not only this oers a new point of view

for the topological symmetries, but this allows us to obtain a discrete lattice formulation

with a brst invariant gauge-xing, oering thereby a new understanding of the continuous

limit. it also gives a concrete denition of non-perturbative physics.

in secs. 2-5 we present the continuum 5-dimensional topological formulation. in sec.

6 we describe the lattice stochastic formulation including the lattice fokker-planck and

langevin equations, in which the 5th time t = x5 is identied with the number of monte
carlo sweeps. we describe a new monte carlo algorithm based on the 5-dimensional

critical limit g0  0 which controls both physical correlation lengths and dynamical auto-
correlation times, with time-step in lattice units given by   g13/11
in gluodynamics.
we conjecture that the physical spectrum may be given by the eigenvalues of the fokker-

0

planck hamiltonian. in sec. 7 we present a 5-dimensional topological lattice formulation.

in sec. 8 we indicate how our approach extends to fermions, and we conclude with some

speculation on future developments. readers who are primarily interested in monte carlo

calculations may read sec. 6 independently.

2. the 5-dimensional continuum action

2.1. the langevin equation

the langevin equation proposed by parisi and wu was [4]:

5a = df + ,

(2.1)

where  is a gaussian white noise. in the stochastic approach, the correlation functions
are functionals of a(x, x5) that are the solutions of this equation. the 4-dimensional
green functions are obtained in the limit where all arguments in the stochastic time are
equal, and x5  . since we consider a stochastic process, we can as well take initial
conditions at x5  , and dene the green functions at any given xed time, for instance
x5 = 0. the convergence toward an equilibrium distribution relies on ergodicity theorems

3

that accord with physical intuition for which the relaxation of a gas to the state of maximal

entropy is obvious, whatever of the initial distribution of its constituents.

a diculty with this langevin equation is that it provides no restoring force along

the gauge orbits, because the euclidean action s(a) is gauge-invariant. consequently

the probability escapes to innity along the gauge orbits, and there is no normalizable

equilibrium probability distribution. this may be remedied by modifying (2.1) by the

introduction of a gauge-xing term that is tangent to the gauge orbit [12] ,

5a = df + dv[a] + .

(2.2)

the gauge-xing term dv[a] has the form of an innitesimal gauge transformation, and
consequently it has no eect on the expectation-value of any gauge-invariant observable.

the innitesimal generator v[a](x, t) may, in principle, be completely arbitrary, and the

issue of a correct gauge xing, without gribov copies does not arise.

the last equation may be written in a way which respects gauge invariance in ve

dimensions. the idea is to identify v[a] with an independent 5th eld component

v = a5(x, t)

(2.3)

which eventually be xed in the functional integral by a gauge-xing term in the action.

then the gauge-xed langevin equation (2.2) may be written as:

f5  df = 

where f5 = 5a  da5. the relation

a5 = a1a .

(2.4)

(2.5)

will be imposed in the context of topological eld theory by a 5-dimensional gauge condi-

tion.

we would like to obtain a functional integral representation for the langevin equa-

tion (2.4). this is a non-trivial problem because there is a gauge invariance, and the

determinant of the map which connects the as and the noise s has longitudinal zero

modes. instead of attempting to solve these questions by manipulations on the langevin

equation, we will pass directly to a 5-dimensional topological quantum eld theory. later

with lattice regularization we shall verify the consistency of the 5-dimensional formulation,

including the absence of gribov copies, and we shall shall show that after elimination of

auxiliary elds present in this theory, one recovers the langevin equation and the equiva-

lent fokker-planck equation.

4

2.2. the 5-dimensional brst symmetry

the expression of the complete symmetry of the theory boils down to the knowledge of

a brst operator which encodes at once the supersymmetry of the stochastic process and

the gauge symmetry of the theory. this operator is that of the topological symmetry of a

gauge eld in ve dimensions, dened modulo gauge transformations. there is not much

choice for exhibiting such a brst operator, and the solution was given in [9]. it involves

a fth dimensional component for the gauge eld, that we denote as a5. unavoidably,

the vector fermion that is needed to express the jacobian of the constraint (2.1) must be

enlarged into a ve dimensional vector (, 5). if we denote by c the ordinary faddeev

popov ghost and  its ghost of ghost, the combined brst operator for the stochastic

supersymmetry and the gauge symmetry follows therefore from the following geometrical

equation [9]:

(s + d)(a + c) +

1
2

[a + c, a + c] = f + dx + 5dx5 + 

(s + d)(f + dx + 5dx5 + ) = [a + c, f + dx + 5dx5 + ]

(2.6)

the second equation is the bianchi identity of the rst, thus one has s2 = 0 on all elds

which ensures the consistency of this symmetry which mixes the yangmills symmetry

with the supersymmetry of the stochastic process. here c,  and 5 are fermi ghost

elds with ghost number ng = 1 and  is a bose ghost eld with ghost number ng = 2.

this equation gives, after expansion in ghost number:

sa =  + dc

sa5 = 5 + d5c

s = d  [c, ]

s5 = d5  [c, 5]

sc =  

1
2

[c, c]

s = [c, ] .

(2.7)

it is identical to the topological brst symmetry for a yangmills eld in ve dimensions.

5

we need anti-ghosts and lagrange multipliers, and their s-transformations. they are:

s  = b  [c, ]
s 5 = b5  [c, 5]
sb = [c, b] + [, ]
sb5 = [c, b5] + [, 5]
s  =   [c, ]

s = [c, ] + [, ] .

(2.8)

all elds in (2.7) and (2.8) are valued in the same lie algebra representation as a. in

the lattice formulation of this symmetry, it will be advantageous to redene the anti-

ghost and lagrange multiplier elds to eliminate the dependance on c in (2.8), that is,
s  = b, sb = 0, s  = b, sb = 0, s  = , and s = 0.

there are ve degrees of freedom for the choice of a dynamics, one for each component

of a, with lagrange multipliers elds b and b5. one of them will serve to gauge-x the

ordinary 5-dimensional gauge invariance, with the condition (2.5); the other four will

enforce the langevin equation (2.4), following the now standard methods of tqfts. the

gauge xing of the longitudinal modes in  will use  as a lagrange multiplier.

2.3. the action

the complete action must be s-invariant. we will gauge x the 5-dimensional invari-

ant:

z dxdx5 tr(f5d f )

(2.9)

this term is invariant under any local shift in a and a5, since the lagrangian can locally
be written as tr(f 
 ). of course this means that we use special boundary
conditions for the variations, and eventually on the s. the choice of this term may appear

2 5(f 

 f 

5 f 

 )+ 1

as quite intuitive: it enforces the idea that the stochastic time is unobservable, since it is

independent of the metric component g55, and it is compatible with yangmills invariance.

we will use an sexact term for xing all the invariances and introducing all relevant

drift forces of stochastic quantization. remarkably, the topological brst symmetry just

described is precisely what is needed to do so, that is, to represent a gauge theory in

stochastic quantization by a functional integral with a high degree of symmetry [9].

6

to impose all relevant gauge conditions, we take the brst-exact action:

i = z dxdx5 s tr(cid:0) (f5  df 

1
2

+ (a5  d +
+ 5(aa5  a)(cid:1).

b)


2

[, ])

(2.10)

the consistency of this choice of this gauge function will be further justied by showing that
it gives a perturbatively renormalizable theory. here a, a and  are arbitrary parameters.

when  is non-zero, quartic interactions are introduced. of course  = 0 gives simpler

expressions, but nothing forbids  6= 0, ( = 0 might be a stable xed point under

renormalization).

[alternatively one may make a linear gauge choice by setting  = 0

and taking  instead of d.] the rst two terms are invariant under 5-dimensional
gauge transformations. the rst term concentrates the path integral around the solutions

of (2.4), modulo ordinary gauge transformations, while the second term xes in a gauge-

covariant way the internal gauge invariance of  that one detects in the brst variation
s = d + .... the third term xes the gauge invariance for a, a5. as we will see
in section 3, all these terms are essentially determined by symmetry and power counting

requirements.

we may introduce a background yangmills symmetry, which transform all elds, but

a, in the adjoint representation, while a transform as a gauge eld. the shortest way to

represent such a symmetry, is to dene it through a background brst symmetry, with

generator  and background ghost  (which do not appear in the action). since s and 
must anticommute, and 2 = 0, we easily nd that we obtain both the action of s and 

by extending (2.6) into:

(s +  + d)(a + c + ) +

1
2

[a + c + , a + c + ] = f + dx + 5dx5 + 

(2.11)

(s +  + d)(f + dx + 5dx5 + ) = [a + c + , f + dx + 5dx5 + ]

when one expands the latter equation one must assign a new ghost number to  and ,

which is independent of that carried by s and the propagating elds. this determines
all transformations of s and  on all elds, with s2 = 2 = s + s = 0. one then

observes that the rst two terms in (2.10) are not only s-invariant as s-exact terms, but

they are also -invariant, without being -exact. these terms involve gauge-covariant

gauge functions for a and  in ve dimensions. the aim of the renormalization proof,

7

using power counting, will be to show that these terms, up to multiplicative rescalings, are

the only ones which satisfy both s and -invariances. the third term is not -invariant,

and it will be necessary to prove that when the parameter a changes, this does not aect

the sector of the theory dened by s and  invariances.

to investigate the properties of our action, we must expand (2.10), which is a simple

exercise. one gets:

i = z dxdx5 tr(cid:0) 

1
2

bb + b(f5  df)

+ (ad5 + dd  [, ])

 (d[5]  dd[]  [, f])

+ (a5  d +
 5(a(5 + d5c)    dc)(cid:1).

[, ])


2

(2.12)

in order to see the dynamical content of this action, we identify and eliminate the

auxiliary elds. the equation of motion of b5 gives back the gauge-xing condition that
we wish to impose:

aa5 = a.

(2.13)

moreover the equation of motion of b has the same form as the langevin equation,

f5  df = b.

we also eliminate 5 and  and we get,

a5 = d 


2

[, ]

a  = a 5 + d .

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

thus a5 can be expressed as a function of a, and 5 can be expressed as a function of
. this is the key of a gauge-xing that does not suer from the gribov ambiguity, and
the gauge condition aa5 = a combines the virtues of axial and laudau gauges. by
integrating over all values of a5, the faddeevpopov zero modes that one encounters in the
genuine 4-dimensional theory just disappear. it is tempting to compare the integration

8

over a5 to the integration over moduli that also solves the problem of zero modes of

reparametrization ghosts in string theory.

we will give much more details about the elimination of gribov copies in sec. 7,
although a fourier transformation on the variable x5 could help understanding directly

how the multiple intersections of gauge orbit that occur in four dimensions could be split

on dierent orbits in ve dimensions.

finally, after integrating out b and b5, we get:

i +z dxdx5 tr(f5df ) z dxdx5 tr(cid:0)

 5(ad5c + dc + [a, ]) (cid:1)


2

one has a5 = a1a in this action.

to derive feynman rules, we examine the part of the resulting action that is quadratic

in the elds. it is given by

i0 = ia + i + i + ic

(2.18)

1

i =z dxdx5tr(cid:0) (a5 + )(cid:1)
ic =z dxdx5tr 5(cid:0)  a5c + c(cid:1)

(2.19)

where we have dropped exact derivatives in ia.

an important observation is that all ghost-antighost pairs, (, ), (, ) and
(c, 5) have a free action which is parabolic: it is rst order in 5, and the correspond-
ing matrix of spatial derivatives is a negative operator. consequently all ghost propa-

gators are retarded, d(x, t) = 0 for t = x5 < 0. for example for a = 1, all ghost-
antighost pairs have the momentum-space propagator (i + k2)1, with fourier transform

9

d(x, t) = (t)(4t)2 exp(x2/4t), where (t) is the step function. moreover ghost num-

ber is conserved, and an arrow which represents the ow of ghost charge may be assigned

to each ghost line: it points from the past to the future. on the other hand, the action of

the a-eld is second order in 5, so a lines freely move forward and backward in time. (its

momentum-space propagator is (cid:16)2 + (k2)2(cid:17)1

= (2k2)1(cid:16)(i + k2)1 + (i + k2)1(cid:17).)

ghost number is also conserved at every vertex. consequently in a diagrammatic expan-

sion, every ghost line may be followed from the point where it enters a diagram from the

past, as it moves monotonically from the past to the future, until it exits into the future.

(the transformation of a  into two s and back is allowed.) it follows that in a diagram

containing only external a-lines, there can be no closed ghost loops apart from tadples.

with dimensional regularization the tadpole diagrams vanish, and in this representation of

gauge theory, ghost diagrams provide accounting checks on the renormalization constants

that are expressed in ward identities, as usual, but they do not appear in the expansion of

correlation functions the a-eld. with lattice regularization, the tadpole diagrams yield

the famous ito term.

another way to see that the ghost determinants have no gribov problems is to note

that the initial-value problem for a parabolic equation has a unique solution.

in the

section devoted to lattice regularization, we will indeed integrate out the ghosts exactly,

and explicitly verify the absence of gribov copies.

we now turn to the question of understanding the renormalization of this action.

3. perturbative renormalization

the action (2.12) is renormalizable by power counting. indeed, the form of the propa-

gators implies that the canonical dimension of all elds with an index 5 is equal to 2, while

other elds have dimensions 1. it follows that we start from an action where the coupling

constant has dimension 0, and we can apply the general result that it can be renormalized

order by order in perturbation theory by a nite number of counter-terms.

the main question is of course to investigate the structure of the counter-terms. we

will only sketch the demonstration that this action is actually stable under renormaliza-

tion, which means that the generating functional of green functions can be dened, order

by order in perturbation theory, while satisfying the same ward identities as the action

(2.10), corresponding to its invariance under s-symmetry, so(4)-symmetry, ghost number

10

conservation, and to the choice of a linear condition aa5 a in the sector which violates
the -invariance.

the action (2.12) that determines perturbation theory can indeed be be split in two

parts:

i  i(a, a5, , , b, 5, , , )

+(cid:16)b5(aa5  a)  5(a5c  dc + a5  )(cid:17).

(3.1)

the rst term, where the elds a5 and 5 must be understood as independent elds,
(before eliminating b5), is s- and -invariant, while the last part is only s-invariant. in
order to achieve the algebraic set-up which ensures perturbative renormalizability while

maintaining the form of the action (up to so-called multiplicative renormalization), it is

enough to remark that one can write the second term as:

b5(aa5  a)  5(a5c  dc  a5  )
=b5(aa5  a)  5(ad5  d)c

(3.2)

where c = c+(a5d)1(a5). the change of variable c  c is perturbatively
well dened, with a trivial jacobian, because the operator a5  d is parabolic. (this
will be explained in detail in section 7, devoted to the lattice regularization.)

if we now introduce an ordinary brst symmetry s, with c as a faddeevpopov

ghost, we are almost in the ordinary situation of the renormalization, except that we
have more elds. we have that s acts on a, a5, , , b, 5, , ,  as ordinary gauge
transformations with the parameter equal to c, sc = cc, s 5 = b5 and sb5 = 0. the
action (3.2) can be written as:

i  i(a, a5, , , b, 5, , , )

+ s(cid:0) 5(aa5  a)(cid:1)

(3.3)

the rst term is s-invariant as a consequence of its -invariance:
it corresponds to the
cohomology with ghost number zero of s, restricted to the terms with the correct power
counting (6 with our power assignmant), while the second term is s-exact, and will remain

stable order by order in perturbation theory because of the linear gauge condition aa5 
a. notice that i depends on a, but a-dependent observables are independent of this
parameter, as will be shown in sec. 7.

the complete proof that the theory can be renormalized multiplicatively is just a slight

amplication of the standard proof of the renormalizability of the 4-dimensional theory in

11

a linear gauge. it involves introducting sources for all s variations, as well as using the
equation of motion of the antighost 5 as a ward identity. when the ward identity of the
s-invariance is combined with that of the topological s-invariance, using locality, one can

prove from purely algebraic considerations that the counter-terms can be built order by

order in perturbation theory such that, when they are added to the starting action (2.10),

they provide an identical action, up to mere multiplicative renormalization constants for

the elds and parameters. essential is in this proof is the use of a linear gauge function

aa5  a.

a notable feature of the renormalization is that besides the multiplicative renormal-

ization of the elds and coupling constants there is also a renormalization of the stochastic

time

t = zttr .

(3.4)

4. observables and gauge invariance

it is now clear how observables should be dened: they are the cohomology with ghost
number zero of s; moreover, they must be computed at a same value of x5. using the
translation invariance under x5, and provided that the stochastic process starts at x5 =

, the physical theory can be dened in any given slice of the 5-dimensional manifold.

this points out the relevance of the boundary term (2.9), which is independent of the metric

component g55. perturbatively, the equal-time gauge-invariant correlation functions are

guaranteed to agree with those calculated in 4-dimensional theory by the usual faddeev-

popov method. on the other hand, gauge non-invariant correlation functions are not

expected to agree within the framework of local renormalizable 5-dimensional gauges that
we consider in this paper 1.

there are also green functions that can be computed with elds at dierent values
of x5, as well as the green functions that involves the topological ghosts. we leave their

interpretation as an interesting open question, although they are not directly relevant to

physics.

once the renormalization has been done properly, one can integrate out all the ghost

elds of the type ,  and c, provided that one considers observables which depend on

1 to recover the local 4-dimensional faddeevpopov distribution, one needs a non-local 5-

dimensional gauge-xing on a5 [15].

12

a only. this follows from the parabolic or retarded behavior of all ghost propagators
in the 5-dimensional theory. it will be demonstrated by explicit calculation with lattice

regularization in section 7 that, when the ghost elds are integrated out, only the tadpole

diagram survives so the ghost determinent is trivial and contributes only a local term to

the eective action which is in fact the famous ito term. this result, which explains the

disappearance of the problem of gribov copies, has an immediate application: mean values
of observables are independent of the parameter a. it should be clear however that the

ghosts and ghosts of ghosts are nevertheless necessary to unveil the topological and gauge

properties of the theory and to control its ward identities.

the other question is obviously that of the independence of physical expectation values

of the gauge parameter a which appears in the gauge function aa5  a. to prove this,
one observes that the observables are s-invariant without being s-exact, while the a-
dependence is through an s-exact term, so the standard brst method based on ward
identities applies. one can also prove directly the non-renormalization of the s-exact term

in (3.3).

we mention the possibility of introducing the interpolating gauges used in [16] for

dening the physical coulomb gauge as the limit of a renormalizable gauge.

finally, one must of course verify that no anomaly in the s- and -symmetries can

occur. the absence of s-anomalies is quite obvious if one examines the consistency condi-

tions for a topological symmetry; for the background yangmills symmetry, no anomaly

is expected, since we are in the case of a pure yangmills theory, without 4-dimensional

chiral fermion. the inclusion of spinors is a most interesting question, on which we will

comment in the last section.

5. non-perturbative aspects

in the previous section, we have veried that perturbation theory is as well dened in

the 5-dimensional approach as it is in the 4-dimensional one.

5.1. global properties of gauge-xing

the gauge choice made here has the global property of a restoring force because it is

derivable from a minimizing functional. consider the functional

f [a] = (2a)1(a, a) = (2a)1z d4xa2,

(5.1)

13

which is proportional to the hilbert square norm. here a > 0 is a gauge parameter. (more

generally, one can take f [a] = r d4xaa, where  is a strictly positive symmetric

matrix that characterizes a class of interpolating gauges [16].) the gauge condition used

here, aa5 = a, may be expressed as

where

a5(x) = g(x)f ,

g(x)  d



a(x)

(5.2)

(5.3)

is the generator of local gauge transformations. it satises the lie algebra commutation

relations

[ga(x), gb(y)] = (x  y)f abcgc(x) .

indeed, one can verify that

g(x)f = a1a(x).

(5.4)

(5.5)

to see that the gauge-xing force is globally restoring, consider the ow dened by

the gauge-xing force alone

5a = dv = dgf ,

(5.6)

in the langevin equation (2.2). under this ow the minimizing functional f decreases

monotonically, since

5f [a] = (

f
a

, 5a) = (

f
a

, dgf )

= (gf , gf )  0.

(5.7)

a consequence of our gauge choice is that the langevin equation (2.4) is parabolic.
indeed, let a5 = a1a be substituted into this equation, and consider the highest
derivatives on the right-hand side,

a
t

= a + (a1  1)a + . . . ,

(5.8)

where the dots represent lower order derivatives. one sees that for a > 0, the operator

that appears on the right is negative, which assures convergence at large t.

14

5.2. how the gribov problem is solved

let us now discuss the gribov question in more detail, and explain how our use of the

gauge function aa5  a escapes the ambiguity.

the origin of this ambiguity in the 4-dimensional formulation, as given by singer [2],

was the compactness of the (euclidian) space. it does not apply anymore, since the 5-

dimensional formulation is necessarily non-compact: the system requires an innite amount

of time to relax to equilibrium. in our formulation the stochastic time runs from  to
, and one evaluates the green function at an arbitrary intermediate time, say x5 = 0.

then, there is the explicit argument, which we already mentioned, of considering all

ghost propagators, whether they are the  and  topological ghosts or the faddeevpopov

ghost: by taking the suitable boundary conditions at x5 = , no zero modes can occur
since we have parabolic propagation. it is a convincing argument, and we will check it in

great detail in section 7, in the framework of the lattice regularization of our 5-dimensional

formulation. we will prove that the integration on all ghosts does not lead to zero modes

that would make ambiguous their elimination. in our opinion, this a concrete verication

of the assertion that the gribov problem is solved.

to see intuitively where the gauge-xing force concentrates the probability, observe

from (5.7) that the gauge xing force is in equilibrium only where g(x)f = 0. this

equilibrium may be stable or unstable, but the gauge xing force drives the system toward

stable equilibrium only, namely where the second variation of f [a] under innitesimal

gauge transformation is a positive matrix. this is equivalent to the condition that the

faddeev-popov matrix

m ab(x, y) = ga(x) gb(y)f

(5.9)

has positive eigenvalues. with gf = a1a, the matrix m and the condition for
stable equilibrium are given by

m = a1d  0.

(5.10)

thus the conditions for stable equilibrium are (a) transversality of the vector potential,

a = 0 and (b) positivity of the faddeevpopov operator, d  0. these two
conditions dene the gribov region, a region which gribov suggested (not quite correctly)

was free of copies. as long as the gauge-parameter a > 0 is nite, the gauge-xing is

soft in the sense that the weight on each gauge orbit has a spread that is centered on the

gribov region. as a approaches 0, the equilibrium probability gets concentrated close to

15

the gribov region. the gauge-xing force drives the system by steepest descent along a
gauge orbit toward a relative or absolute minimum of the functional i[a][g]  f [ga], so
gribov copies that are unstable equilibria (saddle points of i[a][g]) are avoided in the limit
a  0. however the relative minima are in fact gribov copies of the absolute minimum, so

in the limit a  0 this gauge-xing distributes the probability in some way among these

relative minimum, possibly even entirely at the absolute minimum. however the validity

of the present approach in no way depends on taking the limit a  0.

it is interesting to ask how instantons play a role in the 5-dimensional presentation, for

instance in a semi-classical approximation. their interpretation is actually quite simple.
the bosonic part of our action is a sum of squares, namely |f5|2 + |df|2. it obvi-
ously gives and an absolute minimum when it vanishes. this occurs for x5-independent

solutions, with a5 = a = 0 and satisfying df = 0. this means that the classical
4-dimensional instanton solutions also minimize the 5-dimensional path integral: they are

the solitons of the 5-dimensional theory.

we are therefore in a situation where, from various points of view, the path integral

seems well dened. we can now seriously consider its evaluation for large eld cong-

urations, since the question of duplicating orbits does not occur. it is however clear that

the space of connections is not appropriate for dening a meaningful measure, and we will

shortly look at the lattice formulation of this extended version of the yangmill theory,

keeping in mind that the use of the fth time allows a more complete presentation of the

theory.

6. stochastic lattice gauge theory and new monte carlo algorithm

6.1. lattice gauge theory with discrete time

numerical calculations in lattice gauge theory are eected by monte carlo methods

which rely on the simulation of a stochastic process. the stochastic process in question is
specied by a matrix t (ut+1, ut) > 0 of transition probabilities ut  ut+1, on congura-
tions of horizontal link variables, ut = {ux,t,} and ut+1 = {ux,t+1,}, where  = 1, ...4.
consider a transition probability of the form

t (ut+1, ut) = n exp{ xx,

retr(cid:16)i  (u 1

x,t+1,vx,t,) (cid:17) } ,

(6.1)

where  is a positive parameter. here vx,t, = vx,(ut) is a group element that depends
on the horizontal conguration at time t that will be specied shortly. for appropriately

16

chosen normalization constant n , this expression satises the requirement that the sum

of transition probabilities out of any state is unity

z yx,

dux,t+1,t (ut+1, ut) = 1 .

(6.2)

this follows from invariance of the haar measure under translation on the group,
dux,t+1, = du 

x,t+1,, where u 

x,t+1, = v 1

x,t,ux,t+1,.

we set

vx,t, = u 1

x,t,5 exp(fx,t,)ux,t,ux+,t,5,

(6.3)

where  is another positive parameter, and fx,t, is a lattice analog of the continuum drift
force (df)cont that is specied below. this gives

t (ut+1, ut) = n exp{xx,

retr(cid:16)i  exp(fx,t,)ux,t,ux+,t,5u 1

x,t+1,u 1

x,t,5(cid:17) } .

where the product of 4 u s is the transporter around the plaquette in the (-5) plane,

starting and ending at the site (x, t). this expression is manifestly invariant under 5-

dimensional local gauge transformations provided that fx,t, transforms like a site variable
at x in the adjoint representation,

(6.4)

fx,t,  gfx,t, = (gx,t)1fx,t, gx,t ,

(6.5)

which will be the case.

in the last expression for t , the variables ux,t,5 associated to time-like links serve
merely to eect a gauge transformation gx,t = ux,t,5 on the variables ux,t+1, associated to
the space-like links. consequently the ux,t,5 may be assigned arbitrarily without aecting
expectation values of the observables which are the gauge-invariant functions of the space-

like link variables at a xed time. we shall shortly gauge-x ux,t,5 by a lattice analog of
continuum gauge xing implemented above, where by ux,t,5 will be expressed in terms of
the ux,t, so that eq. (6.2) is satised.

recall that the 5-dimensional continuum theory contains no dimensionful constant,
apart from the cut-o, when engineering dimensions are assigned according to [t] = [x2].

consequently the discretized action should depend on the lattice spacings only through

the ratio

 

at
a2
s

,

17

(6.6)

which denes the parameter . here as and at are the lattice spacings in the space and
time directions respectively, with at being the time for a single sweep of the lattice in a
monte carlo updating. we write

ux,t,  exp(g0asacont

x,t,)

ux,t,5  exp(g0atacont

x,t,5) ,

(6.7)

where g0 is the unrenormalized coupling constant, and cont designates continuum per-
turbative variables.

to verify this point, we estimate the quantities that appear in eqs. (6.1) and (6.3).

the lattice drift force, specied below, is of order

fx,t,  g0a3

s(df)cont .

this gives

and nally

ux,t,ux+,t,5u 1

there remains to specify the lattice drift force fx, and the gauge-xing of ux,t,5. for
this purpose we shall establish a correspondence between lattice and continuum quantities.

s(u )  g2

0scont =

g2
0

4 z d4x(f a cont



)2 ,

(6.15)

which depends only on the horizontal link variables u = {ux,} at a xed time. it may
be the wilson plaquette action

sw = 2xp

re tr(i  up)

(6.16)

for pure gluodynamics, where the sum extends over all plaquettes p, or the eective action

that results from integrating out the quark degrees of freedom,

s(u ) = sw  g2

0tr ln(d + m) ,

(6.17)

where d + m represents the lattice dirac operator of choice. let the lattice color-
electric eld operator ex,,a be dened by

ex,,a  (taux,)


(ux,)

,

(6.18)

where [ta, tb] = f abctc, and tr(tatb) = (1/2)ab. it has 4 components,  = 1, ...4, because
our perspective is 5-dimensional. with (ux,)   + (ta) g0asaa cont

correspondence between lattice and continuum quantities,

x,

ex,,as(u )  g0a3
s

scont
aa cont

x,

= g0a3

s(df)cont ,

(6.19)

and we take for the lattice drift force

fx,,a = ex,,as(u ) .

(6.20)

the lattice color-electric eld operator dened by the remarkably simple expression

(6.18) represents the color-electric ux carried by the link (x, ). it satises the lie algebra

commutation relations

[ex,,a, ey,,b] = x,y, f abcex,,c ,

(6.21)

19

as well as

[ex,,a, uy,] = x,y, tauy,
y, ] = x,y, u 1

[ex,,a, u 1

y, ta .

(6.22)

we may visualize the color-electric eld operator ex,,a acting on s(u ) as inserting ta into

the plaquettes that contain the link (x, ) on the left side of the matrix ux,.

the color-electric eld operator that operates by right multiplication of ta,

e 

x,,a  (ux,ta)


(ux,)

(6.23)

satises the lie algebra commutation relations with opposite sign

[e 

x,,a, e 

y,,b] = x,y, f abce 

x,,c .

(6.24)

since left and right multiplication commute, we have

[ex,,a, e 

y,,b] = 0 .

with

ux,ta = (ux,tau 1

(6.26)

where the real orthogonal matrices oba(ux,) = oab(u 1

and satisfy

e

(6.27)

(6.28)

the generator of innitesimal gauge transformations gx,a is easily expressed in terms
x ux,gx+,

of these operators. a generic innitesimal gauge transformation ux,  g1
with gx = 1 + x, is given by

ux, = xux, + ux,x+

= (d)xux,m ,

where

(d)x  ux,x+u 1

x,  x = ta(d)x,a .

20

(6.29)

(6.30)

this denes the lattice gauge-covariant dierence d that corresponds to the continuum
gauge-covariant derivative. it has a simple geometric meaning, being the dierence between

 at x +  transported back to x, and  at x. this innitesimal gauge transformation

induces the following change in a generic function f (u ):

f = f (u + u )  f (u )

= xx,

(6.31)

(6.32)

(6.33)

which is the total ux of color-electric eld leaving the site x. as in the continuum theory,

it is the left-hand side of gausss law. one easily veries the commutation relations

under local gauge transformation, eb
x, transforms like a site variable at x in the adjoint
representation, as required for the gauge-invariance of the transition matrix t (ut+1, ut).
moreover e b

x, transforms like a site variable in the adjoint representation at x + .

we shall implement a lattice gauge xing that corresponds to the continuum gauge
xing described above. we introduce a minimizing function, f (ut), and we impose the
gauge condition

ux,t,5 = exp(ax,t,5) = exp(cid:16)  gx,tf (ut)(cid:17) .

(6.35)

with this denition, eq. (6.2) is satised, because both ux,t,5 and the gauge-xing force
fx,t, are expressed in terms of variables that live only on the hyperplane t. for the

minimizing function we take a lattice analog of a1r d4x(acont)2, for example,

f (u ) = 2a1xx,
f (u )  g2

retr(1  ux,)

0a1z d4x(acont)2 .

(6.36)

21

where a > 0 is a gauge parameter (not to be confused with the lattice units as and at).

this gives the gauge condition

ax,t,5 = gb

(6.37)

6.2. five-dimensional critical limit and new algorithm

the renormalizability of the 5-dimensional continuum theory demonstrated above

controls the critical limit of the 5-dimensional lattice theory just described. in particular

it xes the dependence of the parameter  = (g0) on g0, and thereby provides a new

accelerated langevin algorithm, as we shall see.

the probability for transition from conguration ut

into the volume element

qx, dux,t+1,, where dux,t+1, is haar measure, is given by

dux,t+1,t (ut+1, ut) .

yx,

(6.38)

from eq. (6.4), and invariance of haar measure under translation on the group, it follows

that the probability for transition from the conguration ut to the conguration

ux,t+1, = u 1

x,t,5 exp(fx,t,)ux,t,ux+,t,5wx,t,

(6.39)

depends only on the group element wx,t,,

yx,

dux,t+1,t (ut+1, ut) = n yx,

{dwx,t, exp(cid:16)  re tr(i  wx,t,)(cid:17) }.

(6.40)

thus to generate a new conguration it is sucient to generate the last probability dis-

tribution independently for each group element wx,t,, and also independently of the

conguration ut, and then calculate ux,t+1, from eq. (6.39). (if one is not interested in

gauge-xing, one may set ux,t,5 = 1. however the gauge-xing dened above smooths out

congurations, which may help to accelerate the inversion of the dirac operator.) one

recognizes the familiar langevin algorithm for the su(n) group [17] and [18], with wx,t,

being white noise on the group. the new element is that we shall determine  = (g0) from

the perturbative renormalization group.

22

we noted in our discussion of the continuum theory that the time is renormalized

according to t = zttr. the parameter  = at/a2

s rescales in the same way as the time t,

 = ztr ,

(6.41)

where r is independent of the ultraviolet cut-o  = a1
renormalization-group equation

s . consequently it satises the



d ln

d ln zt

= 

d
 t(g0)

= bt,0g2

0 + o(g4

0) ,

(6.42)

where t(g0) is a -function for the renormalization of the monte carlo time. the coe-
cient bt,0 has been calculated for a theory without quarks, [19]and [20], and is independent
of the gauge parameter a,

bt,0 = 

13n

it is convenient to change dependent variable from  to g0, using

(6.47)

(6.48)

(6.49)

it has been veried to one-loop level for the 5-dimensional theory without quarks that

(g0) is the same as in the faddeev-popov theory, [19]and [20]. for the theory without
quarks we have

b0 =

(6.50)

limit g0  0. this allows us to take for the purposes of numerical simulation

and

(6.51)

(6.52)

(6.53)

we note that  diverges in the critical limit g0  0, but more slowly than 1/g2
0.
moreover the time-step in lattice units diverges,  = at/s2
s   because b0 and b0,t have
opposite sign in a gauge theory. this provides a highly accelerated algorithm. however

one may doubt whether this algorithm converges because high wave-number components,
k  a1

s will overshoot and thus may appear to uctuate wildly. however they are not of
physical interest in the critical limit. on the other hand the modes that are of physical

interest k  qcd will not overshoot. indeed the real problem is likely to be that they
evolve too slowly as usual, in which case the divergence of the step-size (g0)   as
g0  0 is a great asset. obviously the algorithm must be studied in practice before
conclusions can be drawn. in order to apply the algorithm proposed here to a theory with

quarks, the coecient bt,0 must also be calculated with quarks.

if one takes c  , one obtains a dierent, or non-existent, critical theory from the

continuum theory discussed above. if one takes c  0, one obtains the continuous-time

stochastic theory discussed in the next section with a euclidean spatial cut-o.

the 5-dimensional critical limit is approached in the limit g0  0. the value of g0
determines the physical correlation length as measured in euclidean lattice units as in the
same way that it does in the faddeev-popov theory,

as = 1

qcd(b0g2

0)b1/(2b2

0) exp(cid:16) 

24

1

0(cid:17) ,

2b0g2

(6.54)

where qcd is the standard qcd mass scale, although this has been veried to one-loop

level in the theory without quarks [19] and [20]. this formula and the above expression

for (g0) x the time, at, for a single monte carlo sweep in terms of qcd,

b0g2

(6.55)

in the asymptotic scaling region, auto-correlation times of physical observables are nite
and independent of g0 and c when measured in units of 2
qcd. the criteria for choosing
the value of c are similar to those for g0. the auto-correlation time  for a physical

observable should be large compared to one sweep-time,  >> at, but small compared the
total running time t ,  << t , so that the statistical uncertainty, of order n 1/2, is small,

where n  t / .

if it could be established that monte carlo auto-correlation times  of physical ob-

servables are related to physical euclidean correlation lengths l, by a universal relation
 = kl2, where k is the same for all physical observables, then physical information such

mass ratios, could be extracted directly from monte-carlo auto-correlation times. in this

case the mass spectrum is given by the eigenvalues of the fokker-planck hamiltonian, as

explained in sec. 6.3.

we briey mention some attractive features of the algorithm proposed here, which

are those of the langevin algorithm with a time-step in lattice units that diverges in the

critical limit g0  . there is no accept/reject criterion. every updating wx,t, is

accepted, even when the (eective) action is non-local as occurs with dynamical quarks.

only the derivative of the euclidean action s appears in

fx,t, = ex,s = ex,sw + g2

0tr(cid:16)(d + m)1ex,(d )(cid:17) ,

(6.56)

so one does not have to calculate the determinent of the lattice dirac operator, but only

its inverse. moreover it is sucient to calculate this inverse only once per sweep, because

a whole sweep of the euclidean lattice, described by eqs. (6.39) and (6.40), corresponds

to a single hyperplane of the 5-dimensional lattice with action (6.12).

of course other algorithms may be invented that are based on other discretizations in

which the 5-dimensional critical limit is also achived in the limit g0  0.

25

6.3. lattice fokkerplanck and langevin equations

one would be tempted to formulate a brst version of the lattice gauge theory de-

scrobed in the previous section, which has discrete stochastic time t and group-valued

link variables ux,t,5 asociated to the vertical (time-like) links. however neuberger [21] has

shown that lattice brst gauge-xing fails if the gauge-xing function is continuous on the

group manifold. moreover testa [22] has provided a counter-example which shows that if

one tries to get around neubergers theorem by choosing a gauge-xing function that is

not continuous on the group manifold, then inconsistencies in the brst procedure appear

in the form of brst-exact quantities sx with non-zero expectation-value < sx >6= 0.

therefore in order to comply with neubergers theorem we shall make t = x5 continuous

while keeping x discrete, so ax,5 is in the lie algebra whereas ux, is in the lie group,

where  = 1, ...4. gauge-xing will be of the form ax,5 = vx(u ), so that a quantity in

the algebra is xed instead of a quantity in the group. an alternative approach to brst

gauge-xing in lattice gauge theory has recently been provided by baulieu and schaden

[23].

before developing the brst formulation of this 5-dimensional lattice theory, we

rst consider the stochastic process described by the lattice fokker-planck and langevin

equations with random variable which is a 4-dimensional euclidean lattice conguration

u = {ux,}, where ux,  su (n ). note that a euclidean lattice conguration u is a
point on a nite product of lie-group manifolds and that a continuous stochastic process

on lie-group manifolds is the probabilistic analog of quantum mechanics on lie-group

manifolds. both allow a well-dened path-integral formulation.

the continuous-time stochastic process is described by the fokker-planck equation

p

= hfpp ,

where p = p (u, t) is a probability distribution, and the fokker-planck hamiltonian is

this equation describes the limit of the discrete-time stochastic process dened previous

in the previous paragraph it was conjectured that the auto-correlation times  of phys-

ical observables might be related to euclidean auto-correlation lengths l by the universal
relation  = kl2, where k is the same for all observables. if this is true, then the mass

spectrum is given by the eigenvalue equation

hfppeq = 0 would be given by peq = exp(g2

solution for non-zero gauge-xing force because it is not conservative. however with lattice

regularization gauge-xing may be dispensed with. then a similarity transformation by

7. five-dimensional topological lattice gauge theory

7.1. lattice brst operator

we determine the lattice brst operator s which corresponds to the continuum brst

operator dened previously.

it possesses the symmetries of the hypercubic lattice.

in

order to exhibit these symmetries, we shall, in this subsection only, use a symmetric 5-

dimensional notation, whereby x = {x} for  = 1, ...5 represents lattice sites (previously
denoted (x, t)), and we shall also denote link variables by uxy  su(n), with uyx =
(uxy)1, where (xy) is a pair of nearest neighbors.

consider a generic innitesimal transformation uxy,

uxy + uxy = (1 + xy)uxy = uxy(1 + 

xy) ,

(7.1)

where xy and 
write  = s, xy = xy and 
and xy and 

xyare lie algebra-valued grassmann variables, with

xy = (uxy)1xyuxy are elements of the lie algebra, xy = taa

xy. we
xy, where  is an innitesimal grassmann variable,

xy = 



xy = (uxy)1xyuxy .

this determines the action of s on uxy,

suxy = xyuxy = uxy

xy .

28

(7.2)

(7.3)

from the condition s2 = 0, we obtain

sxy = 2
xy

s

xy = 2

xy .

(7.4)

we will not write out explicitly further relations for 

xy since they may be obtained for

those of xy.

as in the continuum theory, we wish to distinguish the innitesimal gauge transfor-

mations from among all possible transformations of uxy. we pose x = cx, where  is an

innitesimal grassmann variable, and cx is a lie algebra-valued grassmann variable, so

the innitesimal gauge transformation dened in the previous section reads

guxy = (cxuxy + uxycy)

= (cx + uxycyuyx)uxy ,

(7.5)

where we have written uyx  (uxy)1. we separate this innitesimal gauge transformation
out of x,, and write

xy  xy  cx + uxycyuyx ,

which denes xy. the action of s on uxy now reads

suxy = (xy  cx)uxy + uxycy .

(7.6)

(7.7)

we identify the lattice site variable cx with the corresponding continuum scalar ghost c(x),

and similarly for x, and assign to them the same transformation law as in the continuum

case namely

scx = x  c2
x

sx = cxx + xcx .

the action of s on xy is obtained from

sxy = sxy + scx  s(uxycyuyx) .

(7.8)

(7.9)

this determines the action of s on all the lattice elds and ghosts.

we write it in the notation in which it will be used, namely with lattice sites designated

by (x, t), where x, is a 4-vector x = {x} for  = 1, ...4, and t = x5. horizontal links,

29

corresponding to links in 4-dimensional euclidean space-time, are designated by (x, t, ),
and vertical links by (x, t, 5). in this notation s acts according to

sux,t, = (x,t, + (dc)x,t) ux,t,

sux,t,5 = (x,t,5 + (dc)x,t) ux,t,5
sx,t, = (d)x,t  [cx,t, x,t,] + (x,t,)2
sx,t,5 = (d5)x,t  [cx,t, x,t,5] + (x,t,5)2

scx,t = x,t  (cx,t)2

sx,t = [cx,t, x,t] ,

(7.10)

which satises s2 = 0, and where the lattice gauge-covariant dierence operator d is
dened in (6.30). under gauge transformation x,t, and x,t,5 transform like site variables
located at (x, t).

we shall shortly take t = x5 to be a continuous variable, while x remains the discrete
label of a 4-dimensional lattice site. in this case, instead of the link variable ux,t,5 in the
lie group, we require a variable ax,t,5 in the lie algebra. the brst operator acts on
ax,t,5 and x,t,5 as in the continuum theory,

sax,t,5 = x,t,5 + d5cx,t

sx,t,5 = d5x,t  [cx,t, x,t,5] ,

(7.11)

where d5 is the continuum covariant derivative and s acts on the remaining variables as
above.

in terms of the lattice color-electric eld operator ex, and generator of local gauge
transformations gx obtained above, the explicit form of the lattice brst operator acting
on functions f = f (u, , c, ) is given by sf = qf , where q is the dierential operator

(7.14)

note that x,t, x,t, bx,t, and bx,t,5 are real variables.

it is remarkable that the lattice brst transformation requires only minimal change

from the continuum brst transformation, even though there is no local lattice curvature

and no lattice bianchi identity, whereas our starting point for the continuum transforma-

tion was the curvature equation and the bianchi identity (2.6).

7.2. five-dimensional topological lattice action

the most powerful representation of the continuous stochastic process just dened is

by path integral. we start with the 5-dimensional topological lattice action which we write

by analogy with the 5-dimensional continuum action presented above,

i = g2

0 z dtxx

x, + ex,s(u ) +

7.3. proof of gauge invariance and absence of gribov copies.

we must show that the expectation-values of physical observables, namely the wil-
son loops, are independent of the gauge-xing functions f and f . for this purpose we
integrate out  and 5, which results in 5 being assigned its gauge-xed value. we next
integrate out the bose ghosts  and , which appear only in

z  z dd  exp(i) .

the integral on  yields

z = z yt,x

dt,xyt,x

(cid:16)  5x + (l)x + fx(cid:17) ,

where fx is independent of , and the nite matrix l is dened by

(l)a

xf  b

y ,

(7.22)

(7.23)

(7.24)

and we have used p(d


e)y, = gy. to evaluate z, we observe that the stochastic

process starts at some initial time t = t0, which may be taken to be t0 = . at the

initial time, x(t0), and the other elds u, , c, are assigned some denite initial value

that is not integrated over, for example x(t0) = 0. with this initial value, the dierential

equation

5x  (l)x = fx

(7.25)

32

is equivalent to the integral equation

b

x(t) = z t

t0

du(cid:16)f b

x(u)(cid:17).

(7.26)

this equation possesses a unique solution x(t). thus unlike gauge-xing on the group, or
in a 4-dimensional covariant gauge, there are no gribov copies.

we shift  by  which cancels fx in the path integral for z. we also multiply as

usual by the formally innite normalization constant det 5. this gives

z = z yt,x

dx(t)yt,x

(cid:16)x(t)  (l)x(t)(cid:17) ,

where l = 1

z = det1(1  l) = exp(cid:16)  tr ln(1  l)(cid:17) = exp(cid:16)trl + ...(cid:17) ,

survives in the last expansion. it is natural to assign the ambiguous expression (0) its

mean value 1/2, which is consistent with other determinations (see appendix b), and we

obtain

we emphasize that we have made an exact evaluation of the ghost determinant, and

obtained a purely local contribution to the eective action.

in the same way we integrate out the fermi ghosts  and , after setting 5 to its

gauge-xed value. they only appear in the factor

thus physical observables are independent of the gauge-xing function f , as asserted.

we next show that they are also independent of f . the integration on b

 is eected,

changes ic to ic

z = z yt,x (cid:16)dux,(t)dax,5(t)dcx(t)d x,5(t)dbx,5(t)(cid:17) exp(i ) ,

(7.38)

(7.39)

and i2 and ia5 are dened above.

we next use standard brst arguments to show that the expectation-value of any

gauge-invariant observable is independent of the gauge-xing function f . observe rst

34

 and i2 are gauge invariant. they are therefore invariant under a little brst

indeed, s is the usual brst operator with cx  x,5 and

bx  bx,5, and it acts on ux, and ax,5 like an innitesimal gauge transformation. because
i1

 and i2 are gauge-invariant they are also invariant under s,

si1

si2 = 0 .

moreover we may express the total action i  as

i  = i1

 + i2 + sj ,

where

j  g2

tr(cid:16) x,5 ( ax,5 + gxf )(cid:17).

(7.41)

(7.42)

(7.43)

thus i  is s-invariant, si  = 0, and moreover the gauge-xing function f appears only in
the term sj that is s-exact. by standard arguments it follows that the expectation-value

of any gauge-invariant observable is independent of f , as asserted, which completes the

proof.

we next integrate out the remaining auxiliary variables b5, a5,  and c to obtain a

(7.44)

may be eected just like the integral on the bose ghosts x(t) and x(t) that was done

the last two terms are the famous ito terms that are discussed in appendix b, and we

see that they are produced automatically by the 5-dimensional topological action when all

auxiliary and ghost elds are integrated out. thus the ghost determinant is well-dened,

and moreover its explicit evaluation gives a local ito term to the eective action which

comes from the tadpole diagrams only. the ito terms, which involve the second derivative

of the action s and of the minimizing function f with an over-all minus sign, favor minima

of s and f over maxima and saddle points. this is physically natural and transparent, so

it is somewhat surprising that the tadpole diagrams, which give the ito terms with lattice

regularization, vanish with dimensional regularization [14].

8. conclusion and perspectives

we have seen that the description of the 4-dimensional yangmills theory in the 5-

dimensional framework allows one to obtain a eld theory description that does not suers

from the contradictions of the four dimensional description. from a physical point of

view, we have introduced in a gauge-invariant way the additional time of the monte carlo

description of the quantum theory and unied it with the euclidean space-time coordinates.

it is of course quite remarkable that this approach permits one to get a fully consistent

lattice formulation of the theory with a natural limit toward a continuum formulation,

while the gribov ambiguity is just absent. our work shows that this ambiguity is merely

an artifact of a purely 4-dimensional description. it is only in ve dimensions that one has

a globally correct gauge xing which is purely local. it thus appears that we can consider

the 4-dimensional physical space as a slice in a 5-dimensional manifold, in which one can

36

express the yangmills theory under the form of a particular topological eld theory. a

way to this this schematically is to observe that the 4-dimensional action can always be

rewritten as the integral of a topological term in ve dimensions:

z d4xl() = z d4xdt

l()



d
dt

(8.1)

thus, the denition of a quantum eld theory amounts to the brst invariant gauge-xing

of the action, a task that we have explained in detail above and which leads to the solutions

of several problems of the purely 4-dimensional formalism.

we briey indicate how our method extends to fermions. to obtain the 5-dimensionsal

fermionic action of a 4-dimensional dirac spinor q, which automatically extends to a 5-

dimensional spinor, it is now quite natural to introduce a topological brst operator, and
to enforce the relevant langevin equation by a brst-exact action. call q and q the
commuting topological ghost and anti-ghost of the anti-commuting spinor q, and bq the
anti-commuting lagrange multiplier eld. then one has sq = q  cq, sq = cq + q,
and one may take s q = bq, sbq = 0 or s q = bq c q, sbq = cbq + q. in the euclidean
formulation the anti-commuting anti-quark spinor eld q is an independent eld, and it


q and 
has corresponding commuting topological ghost and anti-ghost 
q , and lagrange




q  qc, s
q , with sq = 
q c  q. for the anti-ghost one has
q = 
multiplier eld b









q c  
q + 
q = 0 or s 
again s 
q = b
q . all these elds are
q = b
q , sb
q = b
q c, sb
functions of x and t. we take the topological action,

iq =z d4xdt s(cid:0) 
=z d4xdt (cid:0)b

q{d5q  k[(d + m)q + abq] }(cid:1)
q{d5q  k[(d + m)q + abq] }
q[d5q  k(d + m)q] + . . .(cid:1) ,

+ 

(8.2)

which must be added to the 5-dimensional action that we have introduced in the pure yang
mills case. here (d + m)q = 0 is the dirac equation of motion of the 4-dimensional
theory and k is a kernel [24]. one can formally prove, by mere gaussian integrations,

that the equilibrium distribution is independent of the choice of the kernel k [5]. since we

are in the context of a renormalizable theory, it is in fact necessary to introduce a kernel
with canonical dimensional equal to 1, that is k = d + m . this is remarkable, since
this coincides with the necessity of having a well-dened langevin process for spinors, as

discussed for instance in [5]. quite interestingly, power counting would allows a term of

37

the type  f that is not proportional to the kernel: such term would contradict the
stochastic interpretation of the 5-dimensional theory and could be the signal of an anomaly.

for vector theories, such term should not be generated perturbatively.

beyond solving the ambiguities which occur in a purely 4-dimensional approach, our

work might oer new perspectives. we have already mentioned in sec. 6 the existence of

a new algorithm and the conjecture that the mass spectrum is given by the eigenvalues of

the fokker-planck hamiltonian.

one speculation is the question of understanding chiral fermions in a lattice formu-

lation. the topological fermionic action (8.2) is interesting from this point of view. one

may consider introducing a t-dependent mass term (t) in (8.2). this might lead to an

action of the type used by kaplan and neuberger to solve the chiral fermion problem for

the lattice [25][26][27].

in their picture, one introduces a tower of additional fermions,

which can be combined by fourier transform into a 5-dimensional fermion. one notices

that the equation of motion of (8.2) reproduces their 5-dimensional dirac equation when

(t) is a step function. moreover, if one gauges the fermion conservation number in the

fth dimension, which gives an additional u (1) gauge eld aabel(x, t), then (t) could be

understood as a special value for the gauge eld component a5abel(x, t), similar to a kink

that cannot be set globally to zero by local gauge-xing. therefore the choice of (t)

could be determined by topological considerations. this issue of seeing whether one can

understand the 4-dimensional space in which the stochastic process stops as a domain wall

in which everything that remains from the elds of the topological multiplet of q is a chiral

fermion seems to us to be great interest.

the second perspective is that of a dual formulation which would now involve 2-form

gauge elds. it is worth indicating the idea here. in the 5-dimensional framework, the

dual of a one-form is a 2-form, since the sum of the degrees of the curvatures of a and its

dual must equal 5.

if one restricts to the abelian part, one has various possibilities for expressing the the-

ory by using arguments as in [28]. the dual action, up to gauge-xing and supersymmetric

terms, should take the form of a very simple 5-dimensional topological term:

z5

b2  db2.

(8.3)

such a chernsimons type action is interesting, since it can be gauge-xed in the frame-

work of the self-duality for 2-form gauge elds [29]. thus, the question also arises whether

38

a reliable link can be established between the tqft generated by (8.3) and the physical

yangmills theory!

let us nally mention the following observation. suppose we start from an action

with two abelian two-forms in six dimensions, r6 db2  d b2. the eld content that one

obtains by dimensional reduction in four dimensions will be made of 2 two-forms, 4 one-

forms and 2 zero-forms. but the 2 two-forms are equivalent by duality to 2 zero-form in

four dimensions. so, we obtain a eld content equivalent to 4 one-forms and 4 zero-forms.

it is striking that this is the bosonic content of the weinberg-salam model, with its four

gauge elds and four scalars, which are the components of a complex su (2) doublet.

appendix a. derivation of lattice fokker-planck equation

we shall demonstrate that the discrete markov process dened in sec. 6 is described

by the fokker-plack equation of sec. 6 in the limit   0. we shall derive the lattice

fokker-planck hamiltonian hf p from the transition matrix t (ut+1, ut), eq. (6.1) , in
the same way that the kogut-susskind hamiltonian is derived from the transfer matrix of

lattice gauge theory. we follow here the discussion of creutz [30]. we introduce a basis of

states labelled by group elements |u >, where u = {ux,}, with operators

ux,|u >= ux,|u > .

we must nd an operator t with the property

< u |t |u >= t (u , u ).

(a.1)

(a.2)

to order  it will have the form t = 1  hf p , which will allow us to identify hf p .

39

from eqs. (6.1), (6.3), (6.20) and (6.37), we have

t (u , u ) = n exp(cid:16)  (g2

0)1xx,

re tr(i  u 1

x,hx,ux,)(cid:17) ,

(a.3)

here hx,  su (n ) is given by

hx,  exp(vx) exp(fx,) exp( ux,fx+,u 1

x,) ,

(a.4)

and the gauge-xed value of ax,5 appears, namely ax,5 = vx where

we write

vx  gxf .

hx, = exp(kx,) ,

where kx, may be interpreted as the total drift force. to order , it is given by

kx, = fx, + (dv)x ,

(a.5)

(a.6)

(a.7)

where d is the lattice gauger covariant dierence, eq. (6.30). it is the sum of the drift
force fx, = ex,s and a gauge-xing force (dv).

let t0 be the operator whose matrix elements give the transition probability with

total drift force kx, = 0,

< u |t0|u >= n exp(cid:16)  (g2

0)1xx,

re tr(i  u 1

x,ux,)(cid:17).

we have

< u |t |u >=< u |t0| exp(k)u >,

where exp(k)u  {exp(kx,)ux,}. we insert a complete set of states,

(a.8)

(a.9)

< u |t |u >= z du  < u |t0|u  >< u | exp(k)u > .

(a.10)

to order  we have

< u | exp(k)u > = (u , exp(k)u ) = (exp(k)u , u )

= (cid:16)1  xx,

e 

x,kx,(u )(cid:17)(u , u ),

(a.11)

where e 
x, is the color-electric eld derivative operator dened in sec. 6, that acts on
the variable u . let ex, be the corresponding quantum mechanical color-electric eld
operator. in terms of operators we have shown that to order 

t = t0 (cid:16)1  xx,

(a.13)

thus with t = 1  hf p and kx, = fx, + (dv)x, and fx, = ex,s, we obtain the
fokker-planck hamiltonian

where vx = gxf .

appendix b. equivalence of topological lattice action and lattice fokker-planck

equation

we wish to show that the 5-dimensional partition function z, eqs. (7.46) and (7.48),

that was obtained from the topological lattice action by integrating out all the auxiliary

elds, is a path integral representation of the solution to the fokker-plank equation, 5p =
hf p p , with fokker-planck hamiltonian hf p given in eq. (a.14).

for this purpose consider the integral dened for arbitrary o(u ) by

o(u ) z du o(u )k(u , u )

z du  o(u ) n exp(cid:16)  (4)1xx,

(bx,  kx,)2(cid:17) ,

(b.1)

where kx, = kx,(u ) is dened in eq.
u 

x,) =
x,. it will be sucient to show that in the limit   0 this expression corresponds
on the one hand to a discretization of the lattice action (7.48), and on the other hand

(a.7), and bx, is dened by exp(taba

x,u 1

yields

o(u ) = (1  h


fp)o(u ) .

(b.2)

41

we change variable of integration by translation on the group u  = v u , with du  = dv .
with vx, parametrized by vx, = exp(taba

x,), we have

o(u ) = n z db(b) o(cid:16) exp(b)u(cid:17) exp(cid:16)  (4)1xx,

(bx,  kx,)2(cid:17) ,

where (b) is haar measure. we again change variable of integration by bx, = 
kx,, and obtain

(b.3)

o(u ) = z dc (

(b.4)

we now expand to order ,

x,(

2 c + k) = 1 + const  c2

o(cid:16) exp(

2 c + k)u(cid:17) = (cid:16)1 + (

y,(cid:17)o(u ),

(b.5)

where a sum over repeated indices is understood. when this is substituted into (b.4), the

contribution from the expansion of  is cancelled by the normalization constant n , and

one obtains eq. (b.2) , with

h



fp = xx, (cid:16)ex, + kx,(u )(cid:17)ex, ,

(b.6)

as desired.

we next show that the kernel in (b.1) corresponds to a discretization of the path inte-

gral with action (7.48). in the preceding calculation the drift force k = k(u ) depends on u
but not on u , whereas the path integral (7.46) and (7.48) implicitly uses the symmetrized

drift force

ks 

1

2(cid:16)k(u ) + k(u )(cid:17) .

(b.7)

so to compare with the path integral, we express the integral (b.1) in terms of ks plus a
correction which will turn out to be the well-known ito term. we have

k(u ) = ks +

1

2(cid:16)k(u )  k(u )(cid:17) ,

so, with u  = exp(b)u , we may write to the order of interest

ba

y,ea

y,k ,

k(u ) = ks 

1

2 xy,

42

(b.8)

(b.9)

because the last term gives a contribution of order  as we shall show. this gives, to the

order of interest,

exp{(4)1xx, (cid:16)bx,  kx,(u )(cid:17)2

} =(cid:16)1

x,(cid:17)

 exp(cid:16)  (4)1xx,

(bx,  ks,x,)2(cid:17) .

(b.10)

upon substituting this expression into (b.1), one obtains a gaussian integral and gaussian

expectation value

< bb

x,ba

y, >= 2x,y, a,b ,

(b.11)

which is indeed of order , as asserted. consequently in the exponent we may replace
bb

y, by its expectation value, and to the order of interest we have

x,ba

exp{(4)1xx, (cid:16)bx,  kx,(u )(cid:17)2

(b.12)

the last term being the ito term. observe that with u   ut+1 and u  ut, and
u 
x,, so the last expression may be written

x, = exp(bx,), we have bx,   ux,u 1

x,u 1

formally as

we have
