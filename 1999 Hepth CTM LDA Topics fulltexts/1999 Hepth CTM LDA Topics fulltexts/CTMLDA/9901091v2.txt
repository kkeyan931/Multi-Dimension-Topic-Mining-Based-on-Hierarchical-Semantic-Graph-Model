abstract

we use toric geometry to investigate the recently proposed relation
between a set of d3 branes at a generalized conifold singularity and
type iia congurations of d4 branes stretched between a number of
relatively rotated ns5 branes. in particular we investigate how various
resolutions of the singularity corresponds to moving the ns branes and
how seibergs duality is realized when two relatively rotated ns-branes
are interchanged.

1 introduction

the duality between n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory and super-
gravity on the space ads5  s 5 recently conjectured by maldacena [1] was
found by studying the physics and the near horizon geometry of d3-branes
in at space. therefore, to try to extend this conjecture it is natural to study
d3-branes on more complicated spaces. the most natural generalization is
perhaps to study d3-branes at an orbifold singularity [2, 3].

in this context, it is also useful to study t-dual versions of these models.
under t-duality the singularity gets mapped into a conguration of ns5-
branes and the d3-branes gets mapped into d4-branes. the so called brane
box [4, 5] models are related by two t-duality transformations to d3-branes
at an orbifold singularity c 3/. the t-duality transformations maps param-
eters and moduli of the eld theory of the branes into geometrical quantities
of the t-dual brane conguration which makes certain phenomena more eas-
ily studied. one can for instance realize seibergs duality as a reshuing
of branes [6] and in some cases solve the eld theory by lifting the brane
conguration to m-theory [7].

more recently, following the work by klebanov and witten [8], d3-branes
on non-orbifold singularities, leading to gauge theories which are not just
projections of n = 4 theory, have been studied [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17]. the basic example of [8] concerned d3-branes on a conifold singularity
and the subsequent work is various generalizations of that.

one interesting article is [17] where d3-branes on a quotient of the coni-
fold by an appropriate discrete isometry group were studied. a duality be-
tween d3-branes on these singular spaces and congurations of ns-branes
and d4-branes in type iia theory was also proposed and the relation be-
tween resolutions of the singularity and movement of the branes was studied.
furthermore it was proposed that seibergs duality (the interchanging of ns
and ns branes in this context) could be realized as op transitions between
topologically dierent small resolutions of the singularities.

the purpose of this paper is to use toric geometry (for an introduction
see [18]) to study this correspondence in more detail and thereby provide
additional evidence for the proposed duality and the correspondence between
the resolution of the singularity and the movement of the branes. using toric
methods we will be able to show that the higgs branch of the moduli space of
the gauge theory is indeed the generalized conifold singularity. we will also
be able to get an explicit handle on the various resolutions of this singularity

1

by including the fi-terms in the calculation.

toric geometry has been used previously in the study of 3-branes at vari-
ous singularities. the methods used in this paper were introduced in [3] where
d3-branes on c 3/zk orbifolds were studied. in particular it was shown that
only geometric phases of the singularity was seen by the d3-branes. more
complicated orbifold singularities were studied in [19, 20, 21, 10], including
coniold singularities as subsingularities.
it was also shown that the d-
branes are sensitive to topologically dierent resolutions of the singularities,
diering by op transitions.

this paper is organized as follows: section 2 studies the simplest non-
trivial example and explicitly derives the toric data describing this singular-
ity. in section 3 we use the toric data to study how various resolutions are
related to movement of the ns-branes in the t-dual version of the model. in
section 4 we study a more complicated example corresponding to the space
xy = z3w3 and use that to make claims about the general correspondence
between resolutions of the singularity and movement of the ns-branes. in
section 5 we use our methods to study a situation related to seibergs duality
as was proposed in [17] and in section 6 we summarize the paper and discuss
some directions for future research. the paper is nished with an appendix
which contains the toric data for some of the more complicated examples
studied in the paper.

2 the basic example

we are interested in studying n d3-branes on a singularity of the type
xy = zkwk. according to [17] this is t-dual to a conguration with n
d4-branes wound around a compact direction (x6 in our case) and stretched
between k ns-branes and k ns-branes which are placed at various points
along the circle. the branes are oriented as follows

to be able to put the f-term constraints and the d-term constraints on equal
footing (as a symplectic quotient) we will introduce homogeneous coordinates
p0 . . . p7 as follows

q12 = p3p4 q23 = p2p6 q34 = p3p5 q41 = p2p7
q21 = p1p5
q14 = p0p6

q32 = p0p7

q43 = p1p4

in which the f-term constraints are automatically satised. the homoge-
neous coordinates span a c 8 which is acted upon by a u(1)2 action under
which the original q and q elds are the invariant coordinates. the solution
can also be represented in the form of the matrix

where to nd which power of pi a particular q contains, one takes the corre-
sponding column in (7) and take the scalar product with the corresponding
row in (5).

the f-term constraints can now be represented as a symplectic quotient
on the space spanned by the homogeneous coordinates. the symplectic quo-
tient is implemented by the previously mentioned u(1)2 action under which

now we have to nd how the ordinary d-term constraints will act on the
homogeneous coordinates. to do this we introduce the matrix u dened by
t u tr = id

then the d-term constraints are represented by the charge matrix v u where
v contains the charges of the basic elds under the particular gauge group.

one is given in terms of the other three) so v is given by

giving us a charge matrix

now we concatenate the charge matrix from the f-term constraints with the
charge matrix representing the d-term constraints to get the full reduction
on the c 8 spanned by the homogeneous coordinates. the cokernel of the
transpose of this matrix gives us the toric data for the space of interest [3].

recognize the toric description of the space xy = z2w2 which is in agreement
with the proposal of [17].

as usual, when we include the fi-terms we resolve the space. because we
have no fi-parameters for the f-term constraints not all possible phases are
realized and only geometrical phases are seen exactly as in [3]. to show this
and to further study these resolutions we therefore include the fi-parameters
and give the charge matrix in a particularly useful form.

3 analysis of subsingularities

using these expressions we see that for particular values of the fi-parameters
we will have various unresolved subsingularities in our conguration. it is
interesting to analyze how the brane picture corresponds to the singularity
picture for these cases.

if we start with the orbifold singularities we see that if we for example
take 1 + 2 = 0 but leave 3 arbitrary we will leave the rst one of them
unresolved. looking at the d-term equations and assuming 1 and 3 are
positive we see that they are satised if we give expectation values to the
chiral elds as follows

q21 = 
q43 = 

1
2

1 ,

1
2

3 .

(18)

these expectation values corresponds to moving both the ns-branes in the
x7-direction. this will break the rst and the second gauge group down to
their diagonal component and similarly for the third and the fourth gauge
group. furthermore, if we insert these expectation values in the superpo-
tential we see that the elds q12 and q34 becomes the adjoint elds of the
unbroken gauge groups and we get the usual elliptic n = 2 model with two
gauge groups [7].

a slightly more complicated example is to study what happens when we
leave one of the conifold singularities unresolved. by studying the matrix
(15) we see that this happens when we for instance put 1 = 0. inspection
of the d-term constraints reveals that they are satised if we put

1
2

q32 = 
q43 = (2 + 3)

2 ,

1

2 ,

(19)

which corresponds to moving the second ns-brane and the second ns-brane
in the x7-direction. when we insert this into the superpotential we get

2 q34q41 q14  q14q41q12 q21,

this will give a mass to the elds q23 and q34, and integrating them out we
nd

w  q41 q14 q21q12  q14q41q12 q21,

(21)

which is indeed the superpotential for the conifold as proposed in [8].

we can also ask what will happen if we leave one of the suspended pinch
point singularities unresolved. we see that this will happen if we choose
1 = 2. however, we are still free to choose 1 + 2. let us study the
simplest possibility 1 + 2 = 0 rst. this means that 1 = 2 = 0 and we
can assume that 3 > 0. by inspection we nd that the d-term constraints
are satised if we choose

q43 = 

1
2

3 ,

(22)

which corresponds to moving the second ns-brane in the x7-direction. again
we break the third and fourth gauge groups to the diagonal combination and
q34 becomes a chiral supereld in the adjoint of the unbroken part of that
group. the superpotential becomes

w  q21q12q23 q32  q14q41q12 q21 + 
which is the superpotential one would get from a model with two ns-branes
and only one ns-brane.

3 (cid:16) q14q34q41  q23q34 q32(cid:17) , (23)

if we in the last example choose 1 + 2 > 0 instead we still keep the
suspended pinch point singularity unresolved. however, we will resolve some
of its subsingularities giving us a more complicated situation. the d-term
equations tells us that we have to give expectation values to three of the
hypermultiplets which seems to be a highly nontrivial situation. how come
the suspended pinch point singularity is still unresolved? the answer can be
found if one uses that we know that the fi-parameter for a particular gauge
group is geometrically encoded as the dierence in the x7 coordinate of the
ns-brane to the right of of the gauge group and to the left of the gauge group
[6]. from this follows that the nal conguration still has two ns-branes
and one ns-brane in a line, although this line is slightly tilted in the x6, x7
plane.

9

we may also reverse the question and ask what happens with the sin-
gularity when we move a particular ns-brane or ns-brane in a particular
way instead of asking what happens with the brane conguration when we
resolve the singularity. using the correspondence between fi-parameters
and the relative x7 coordinates of the branes again, it is possible to nd out
exactly what fi-parameters a particular movement corresponds to. for in-
stance, if we move the ns-brane separating the rst and the second gauge
groups a distance  in the negative x7 direction, we will get the following
fi-parameters

1 = ,
2 = ,
3 = 0,
4 = 0,

(24)

which, using the d-term equations, corresponds to giving an expectation
2 . since 1 + 2  0 and 2 + 3  0 we can use the previous
value to q12 = 
formulas to see that the unresolved singularities are the third suspended
pinch point singularity and its subsingularities.

4 more examples

after studying the simplest example in detail we may now turn to investigate
more general models such as the one with 3 ns-branes and 3 ns-branes as
shown in gure 3. we can use the method described above to solve for the
higgs branch of the moduli space of the eld theory describing this brane
conguration. the toric data and the charge matrix giving this moduli space
as a symplectic quotient is given in formula (32) in the appendix. the toric
data corresponds to a singularity of the type xy = z3w3 as expected from
the arguments given in [17]. we can use the charge matrix to investigate
what phases are realized when we put 3-branes on such a singularity and
also to nd out how moving the ns- and ns-branes are related to various
resolutions of the singularity. in particular, there are four dierent ways of
moving the ns- and ns-branes in the x7 direction (turning on fi-terms).
namely, we can move an ns-brane in the negative x7 direction, we can move
an ns-brane in the negative x7 direction, we can move an ns-brane in the
positive x7 direction and nally we can move an ns-brane in the positive

x7 direction. by using the charge matrix (32) given in the appendix we see
that these four distinct ways of moving the branes correspond to four distinct
ways of resolving the singularity. these are given in the gure below in the
order corresponding to the movements given in the text.

it should be pointed out that it does not matter which ns-brane or ns-brane
one is moving for this correspondence to hold. the only thing that matters
is if it is an ns-brane or an ns-brane or if we move it in the positive or
negative x7 direction. we may also check that this is true for the previously
studied conguration given in gure 1.

5 seibergs duality

finally we would like to study what happens to the singularity when one
moves an ns-brane past an ns-brane in the x6 direction. this should be
related to seibergs duality as was observed in [6]. in [17] this fact was used
to conjecture that seibergs duality in the d4-branes between ns-branes
picture is related to op transitions between topologically distinct small res-
olutions of the singularity in the t-dual picture. we will now investigate this
claim using toric methods.

11

we can study this phenomenon (following [6]) without encountering the
singularity that would result from actually letting the ns-brane and the ns-
brane meet in space by letting one of the branes move in the x7 direction
before moving it in the x6 direction. then we are free to move the brane in
the x6 direction until we pass the ns-brane since they are at dierent points
in x7 and after the branes have passed each other we can let the branes move
back to their original positions in x7 giving us a conguration where the ns
and ns-brane has changed places.

from the previous discussion we know what happens when we move a
brane in the x7 direction and the singularity structure does not depend on
the x6 coordinates of the ns-branes so what we have to study is what happens
when we move the ns-brane in the x7 coordinate in the conguration where
one ns-brane and one ns-brane has changed places. to be concrete, let
us therefore investigate the conguration with two ns-branes and two ns-
branes related to the previously studied conguration by an interchange of
the ns-brane and the ns-brane surrounding the fourth gauge group. this
conguration is given in gure 4. the eld theory corresponding to this

conguration also has coulomb branches (corresponding to moving the d4-
branes between the ns-branes or between the ns-branes) but since we are
only interested in the higgs branches we will set the vacuum expectation
value of the adjoint chiral supereld which exists for the rst and third gauge
groups to zero. doing this and repeating the previous analysis we get the
same toric data as in the rst example. however, the charge matrix is slightly

12

dierent and is given in the appendix.
control the sizes of the orbifold singularities are 1 and 3.

in particular, the parameters that

if we repeat the analysis performed in section 3 for the conguration in
gure 1 we nd that the same general results hold. the singularity is resolved
in the same way, for instance, if we move any one of the ns-branes in the
positive x7 direction we will remove an upper left triangle from the toric
diagram just as for the original conguration. however, the fi-parameters
that control the sizes of the various singularities are now dierent and we may
ask if it is possible to map them into each other. to make the question more
precise let us study the original conguration where we move the ns-brane
on the left of the fourth gauge group a distance  in the positive x7 direction
and the ns-brane on the right a distance  in the negative x7 direction. this
corresponds to introducing fi-parameters with the following values

1 = ,
2 = 0,
3 = ,
4 =   ,

(25)

and we see that in particular 1 +2  0 and 2 +3  0 so we can use the for-
mulas given in the text. on the other hand, in the dual conguration (where
this ns-brane and ns-brane have changed places) this would correspond to
a set of fi-parameters

1 = ,
2 = 0,
3 = ,
4 =  + ,

(26)

where we see that 1  0 and 3  0 which determines which of the homoge-
neous coordinates to use for the dual conguration.
now we can compare parameters. for each of the subsingularities there
is a particular combination of fi-parameters which controls its size. if we
assume that nothing happens with the sizes when we move in x6 we can
equate them and we get this system of equations (one equation for each
subsingularity)

1 + 2 = 3,

13

2 + 3 = 1,
1 = 1 + 4,
2 = 2,
3 = 1  2,
4 = 4,
1  2 = 22  3,
2  3 = 1 + 22,
3  4 = 3 + 24,
4  1 = 1  24,

1 = 1 + 4,
2 = 2,
3 = 1  2,
4 = 4,

(27)

(28)

where i are the fi-parameter in the original model and i are the fi-
parameter in the dual conguration. this has a solution which is

which means that it seems to be possible to move the ns-branes in the x6
direction while keeping the sizes of the various singularities xed. further-
more, the fi-parameters in (28) precisely corresponds to the fi-parameters
one would expect if one just interchanged the ns-brane and the ns-brane
surrounding the fourth gauge group. to see this we can assume that the
x7 positions of the ns-branes are (with the convention that the ns-brane
between the fourth and the rst gauge group is the rst brane)

x7(1) = 0,
x7(2) = 1,
x7(3) = 2 + 1,
x7(4) = 4.

(29)

if we interchange the the rst and the fourth ns-branes the positions would
instead be

x7(1) = 4,
x7(2) = 1,
x7(3) = 2 + 1,
x7(4) = 0,

14

(30)

which gives exactly the fi-parameters in (28).

we thus see that there is a one to one map between the fi-parameters
between the two conguration related by interchanging of one ns-brane and
one ns-brane. in particular, the various subsingularities of the generalized
conifold will have the same sizes in both congurations. this means that in
this formalism we do not see any sign that the two conguration are related
by a op transition between topologically dierent small resolutions of the
singularities as was conjectured in [17]2.

6 conclusions

we have shown how the toric description of the moduli space of d3-branes
at a generalized conifold singularity is related to the t-dual version with d4-
branes suspended between ns-branes and ns-branes. by studying various
subsingularities of the space it was possible to investigate how moving the
ns or ns branes in the x7 direction in the dual conguration resolves the
singularity in various ways.

we also showed that with toric methods we were able to study what
happens as move two relatively rotated ns-branes across each other in the x6-
direction, corresponding to performing seibergs duality in one of the gauge
groups of the dual conguration. in [17] it was conjectured that this should
be related to op transitions in the toric diagram. we showed that there is
a one to one map between the fi-parameters of the original model and the
seiberg dual model and that this map exactly corresponds to what one would
get by naively moving the branes past each other, keeping their position in the
x7 direction. thus it was not possible to conrm this particular conjecture
of [17]3.

2the real situation is slightly more complicated however. the x6 position of the branes
are encoded in the integrals over the b-eld over the two-cycles of the singularity. when
we change the relative x6 position of the branes we change the b-eld on the corresponding
cycle and what happens when two branes cross is that the b-eld on the cycle in question
actually ips sign. what we have shown is that the real size, as measured by the imaginary
part of the complexied kahler form b + ij , does not change when the ns-branes cross.
however, since the real part of the complexied kahler form changes, there might still be
something like a op transition taking place in the complexied kahler moduli space. it
would be interesting to continue this work along this line of reasoning. i would like to
thank a. uranga for discussions on this topic.

in conclusion one can say that we have given evidence that toric geometry
oers a powerful tool for studying the relation between brane congurations
and branes at singularities. it would be interesting to investigate more com-
plicated singularitites, for example of the type xkyk = zkwk, in an analogous
way.
