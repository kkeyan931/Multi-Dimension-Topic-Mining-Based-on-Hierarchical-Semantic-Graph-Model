abstract

a recent experiment with squeezed light has shown that two-photon absorption by an
atom can occur with a linear intensity dependence. we point out that this result veries
a prediction made by us a decade back from an analysis of a non-local model of quantum
electrodynamics. this model had earlier been proposed by us in an ad hoc manner to
interpret certain features of multiphoton double ionisation and above-threshold ionisation
in an atom placed in a strong laser eld ; in this paper we show that the model can be
obtained eld-theoretically by demanding covariance of the eld lagrangian under a non-
local u(1) gauge transformation. we also show that the model makes direct contact with
squeezed light, and thus allows us to describe these two completely dierent scenarios from
a unied point of view. we obtain a fundamentally new result from our non-local model
of qed, namely that only the past, but not the future, can inuence the present  thus
establishing a non-thermodynamic arrow of time. we also show that correlations within
a quantum system should necessarily be of the einstein-podolsky-rosen (epr)-type, a
result that agrees with bells theorem. these results follow from the simple requirement
of energy conservation in matter-radiation interaction. furthermore, we also predict new
and experimentally veriable results on the basis of our model qed.

introduction

in a beautiful experiment, georgiades et al [1] generated a squeezed vacuum eld by
an optical parametric amplier and focussed it onto a cloud of cesium atoms in a magneto-
optic trap. they found that the rate of the two-photon transition 6s1/2  6d5/2 deviated
from the expected quadratic intensity dependence to a form r = i + i 2, where i was
the squeezed vacuum intensity ; the linear term dominated at low intensities, and the
quadratic term at higher intensities. our conventional wisdom tells us that this feature
of linear intensity dependence of two-photon transitions is shared neither by thermal light
nor by coherent light.

in this paper we draw the readers attention to a non-local model of quantum elec-
trodynamics (qed), suggested quite a few years ago by us [2] in which a possibility of this
linear intensity dependence of two-photon transitions was pointed out for the rst time,
albeit in a dierent context of multiphoton transitions and above-threshold ionisations in
an atom placed in a laser eld. we were led to this model of non-local qed through an
analysis of the behaviour of an atom placed in an intense laser eld under certain specied
conditions  namely, that two distinct photon absorption events by the atomic electron/s
be correlated in phase  and we obtained this two-photon transition with a linear intensity
dependence as the central result of the paper. in [2], however, the non-local potential was
introduced in an ad hoc manner ; in the present paper we provide a eld-theoretical basis
for the same and briey repeat the analysis made in [2]. we bring out certain parallelisms
between the two contexts (intense laser eld and squeezed vacuum eld) and show that
the aforesaid model of non-local qed can be applied to both. as a particular result of
this application, we nd that the time evolution of an (atom + eld) system under the
said conditions shows a remarkable resemblance to a squeezed vacuum. (as we shall show,
apart from pre-multiplying factors, they turn out to be identical). we further show that
a specic result for a single-electron atom placed in a non-local electromagnetic eld ex-
actly matches the abovementioned experimental result of two-photon transition in cesium
placed in a squeezed vacuum.

subsequent to our work [2], a few studies on squeezed light (e.g. gea-banacloche
[3], javanainen and gould [4]) predicted this linear intensity dependence from certain
special models of the four-eld correlation function in squeezed light elds. our approach
needs no such squeezed-eld-specic modelling, but is valid for all (classical as well as
non-classical) radiation elds where phase-correlated photon absorption/emission can take
place in interaction with matter, as we shall show below.

consider an intense classical (thermal or laser) light incident on an atom, and let a
pair of photon absorption events occur at two dierent space-time points (r, t) and (r, t),
the interval between which is very close to zero, i.e. |r  r|  c|t  t|. this situation can
arise when, say, the outer electrons of a rydberg atom absorb a pair of photons within a
time t  1
 . for laser intensities of order 1010 w/cm2 or higher, this is commonplace,
if we remember that in the visible range, a ux of one photon a2
corresponds to 
5  1014 w/cm2 of intensity (a0 and t0 being the atomic units of length and of time
respectively). we have here a situation where two events, which may have occurred far
apart in space, are correlated in phase ; indeed, if the events are spatially separated, the

0 t1
0

correlation assumes the character of an epr-like quantum entanglement.

consider now a dierent scenario : radiation from an optical parametric oscillator
generating a phase-squeezed vacuum eld is absorbed by a three-level atom having a prin-
cipal quantum number  5. if the squeezed vacuum is produced by parametric frequency
down-conversion, where an incident pump photon has split up into two lower-frequency
photons (signal and idler) which constitute a highly correlated photon pair, a two-photon
absorption similar as observed in [1] occurs ; i.e. two photons in exact (or nearly exact)
phase correlation can be absorbed in two events widely separated in space even at low
intensities.

the feature common to these two entirely dierent scenarios is evident. the latter
scenario is directly linked to the abovementioned experimental nding in [1], while the
former is linked to phase-correlated multiphoton excitation/ionization in a regime where,
however, perturbation theory holds. in this paper we show that our model in [2] can be
used, by exploiting this common feature of correlated atomic response to radiation at two
points far apart in space, to give a theoretical description of these two dierent scenarios
from a unied viewpoint. as already mentioned, the linear intensity dependence of two-
photon processes comes about as a natural result of this model, and we shall show how this
linear intensity dependence serves to explain several features long known in multiphoton
double ionisation as well as in above-threshold ionisation, and also serves to predict some
new results.

2. theory

in the usual simple harmonic oscillator mode expansion of the electromagnetic eld
potential a, an integral number of photons (0,1,2,...) is associated with each mode. all
these modes are orthogonal and independent of each other, and since photons obey the
bose statistics, each mode can be occupied by any arbitrary number of photons. however,
in situations such as described above where a phase-correlated behaviour of photons be-
comes manifest, one might think whether a dierent, correlated type of mode expansion
could better describe the situation, much as a correlated wave-function gives a better rep-
resentation of, say, the helium atom than the orbital product wavefunction does. since
there is no force acting between photons, the observed correlation between them is not
due to any conguration interaction as in the case of a multi-electron system, but due
either to the presence of certain non-classical features in the radiation eld introduced by
a non-linear medium (e.g. squeezing), or to correlated interaction of the radiation eld
with the atomic electrons, or both.

we start from the basic fact that in both these scenarios the radiation eld (either as
generated, or as detected by the atomic electrons) enjoys a large second-order coherence,
i.e. two photons are coherently absorbed by the atomic electrons within a vanishingly small
phase dierence  = t. in a study of two-photon transition using a phase-squeezed
light within the framework of the usual qed, javanainen and gould [4] observed that
the four-eld correlation function g(2)(r, t; r, t) = he(r, t)e(r, t)e+(r, t)e+(r, t)i,
essentially the joint probability that two detectors placed at r and r will record photon
counts at times t and t, does not always suce to predict the two-photon transition rate.

3

in fact, we need a more general correlation function. . . we resort to heuristic modelling of
the eld correlations.

in both [3] and [4] the authors gave new four-eld correlation functions derived from
specic properties of squeezed light. in the present paper we show that neither the use
of such specic properties nor any heuristic modelling is necessary, if we adopt the earlier
proposal of attempting a correlated description of the electromagnetic eld.

we show below that the non-local model of qed as expounded in [2] serves to bring
out the feature of (phase) correlation between two (or more) photon modes. consider
two zero-order dressed states |fi = |fi|nfi and |ii = |ii|nii.
in the coulomb
gauge the radiation interaction matrix element coupling these two states is mf i(t) =
 e
mchf (r), nf|p.a(r, t)|i(r), nii. as in our earlier work [2], we introduce a non-local
potential a(r, t, r, t) such that the above matrix element becomes
x  (r, t), (1)
mf i(t) = 
i.e. the interaction at the point x is correlated with the interactions at all other points
x. this non-local interaction had been dened in [2] in an ad hoc manner ; in this paper
we show (see appendix a) how such a potential can be introduced eld-theoretically by
demanding covariance under a non-local u(1) gauge transformation.

e
mchf (x), nf|p.a(x, x)|i(x), nii

where x  (r, t),

the integration in (1) runs over dr and dx, and in this paper we set the limits of the
time integral dt either (i) from  to t  |rr|c
(giving the retarded interaction), or (ii)
from t + |rr|c
to  (which gives the advanced interaction), leaving out epr quantum
entanglement-like correlations for the present. we shall discuss the question of causality
later and shall nd that this restriction turns out to be unnecessary.

we can equivalently use a similar non-local form of the multipolar interaction at the

space-time point x :

ez r.e(x, x) dx

(1)

although nothing can be said about the specic mathematical forms of these non-local
potentials/eld strengths, we will nd that we can go a long way to predict specic conse-
quences of this general non-local eld. in order to quantise this non-local eld, we proceed
by carrying out a fourier expansion [5] of this non-local potential over the usual photon
modes :

a(x, x) = xk11 xk22

[c1212(r, r) exp(ik1.r + ik2.r  ik1 t  ik2t) + c.c.]

(2)

where we have written c12  ck11 k22 , and 12  k11 k22 . in view of (1), we cannot x
the direction of the polarisation vector (r, r) by hand (as in standard qed) without
loss of generality ; this is at once obvious if we make the dipole approximation in (1) or (1).
later in this paper we shall use for (r, r) a power series in r and r with undetermined
coecients, which is the most general form possible. however, to quantise the eld using
the coulomb gauge we impose for the present the condition that

(k1 + k2). = 0.

4

(3)

this restriction will be removed later.

from eqn. (a2) in appendix a, we note that the non-local electric eld in the coulomb

gauge is given by

e(x, x) = (1/c)(cid:18) a

t

+

t(cid:19) =
a

i

c xk11 xk22

(k1 + k2 ) [c1212(r, r)f (x, x)  c.c.] (4)

where f (x, x) is the phase factor in (2). the expression for the non-local magnetic eld
can be found in an analogous manner.

to obtain the eld energy at a point (r, t) we need e2 and b2 which we dene similarly

as in (1) ; thus

e2(r, t) =z z e(x, x).e(x, x) dx dx

where the limits of integration over dt and dt are determined by the choice of interaction
(retarded or advanced). however, in the present work rs are of atomic dimensions, and we
simply put t, t  t for the retarded interaction and t, t  t for the advanced interaction.
an examination of eqns. (2) and (4) shows that in e2 and b2, the crossed terms be-
tween two modes k11 and k22 vanish unless the two modes are strongly phase-correlated.
denoting the population fractions of such correlated-pair modes and of the independent
modes by aii and ai respectively, use of standard methods in quantum electrodynamics
leads to the following expression for the eld energy in a volume  :

where wi is the usual energy summed over single modes, and

w = a2

i wi + a2

(5)

(5)

wii = 1

2pk(cid:0)y 2

kz2

k(cid:1),

(ck + ck). each mode subscript
where yk = i
here actually stands for a correlated mode pair (k11, k22), and 2k stands for k1 + k2 .
y and z satisfy the canonical equations of motion with wii as the hamiltonian as in
standard qed, and we now quantise this non-local eld by requiring that y and z be
q-numbers obeying the commutation relation

2c

[zk, yk ] = ihkk  .

(6)

we thus obtain the non-local eld energy in terms of a new pair of creation and

annihilation operators :

wii = 1

2pk
bk, bk =

hk(cid:16)bkbk + bkbk(cid:17)
2hk

1

(2kzk  iyk) .

where

5

(5)

(7)

equation (5) is identical in form with standard qed, but the creation and annihilation
operators obey a new commutation relation :

hbk, bki = 2kk  ,

[bk, bk ] =hbk, bki = 0

(8)

as may be directly veried from (7) and (6). the following, and only the following, results of
operation of these new correlated-pair mode operators are consistent with the commutation
rules (8) :

bk|nki = nk + 2|nk + 2i,

bk|nki = nk|nk  2i,
bkbk|nki = nk|nki
this shows that b and b are two-photon annihilation/creation operators, and bb is the
usual number operator. once again, by creation of two photons we mean the creation of
one photon in each member of a correlated mode pair , and similarly for annihilation. we
can now write down the potential and eld strengths in terms of these new operators ;
thus

k

a(x, x) =xk s 2hc2
e(x, x) = ixk r 2hk



k(r, r)hbkf (x, x) + bkf(x, x)i
k(r, r)hbkf (x, x)  bkf(x, x)i

(9a)

(9b)

the results obtained so far from our non-locality postulate may be summed up as
follows : quantization of a radiation eld with a high degree of second-order coherence
can depart from the usual qed and can lead to photon modes (more exactly: correlated
mode pairs) generated by two-photon creation and annihilation operators. indeed, if we
let a zero-order dressed state of an atom |i|ni evolve in the presence of the non-local
electron-radiation interaction (1) or (1), we obtain a linear superposition of dressed states
of the form

|i

ck(t)|2ki

(10)



xk=0

for even n ; for odd n, |2ki is replaced by |2k + 1i. the possibility of emission/absorption
of two photons in the rst order of interaction, i.e. linear in eld intensity becomes evident
at once as a consequence of this model. also, the commutation relations (8) are gauge-
independent, and hence from now on we can do away with the transversality restriction as
mentioned after eqn.(3).

3. results and discussion

before we work out the possible consequences of this non-local eld in a typical atomic
transition, let us note its formal similarity with a squeezed state. we recall the denition
of the squeezed state [6] :

|, i = d()s()|0i,

6

(11)

where the squeeze operator s() = exp[ 1
d() = exp (a  a) = e

2 (a)2], and the displacement operator
2 eaea. ( and  are arbitrary complex numbers.)
putting  = 0 gives the squeezed vacuum, while putting  = 0 gives the coherent state.
an expression for the squeezed vacuum in terms of the number states has been given by
hollenhorst [7] ; putting  = rei, this becomes

2 a2  1

||2

s()|0i = (cosh r)

1
2



pn=0(cid:0) 1

2 ei tanh r(cid:1)n 2n!

n!

|2ni

(12)

thus we see that the squeezed vacuum s()|0i has the same form as the expansion
(10) above. the two-mode squeezed vacuum [8], where the squeezing operator is given by
the more generalised form

s() = exp[()a()a(2  )  ()a()a(2  )]

provides another example where the doubly occupied modes in (12) would be replaced
by singly occupied correlated mode pairs ; the signal and idler photons generated in a
parametric down-conversion present themselves at once as forming such a correlated pair.
we can therefore say that the squeezing operator s() is mathematically identical (except
for coecients/multiplying factors) to the evolution operator in a non-local eld, and hence
atoms interacting with a squeezed eld and with an intense radiation eld (for which a
non-local description is valid) can be expected to show the same non-classical features. we
nd below that it is indeed so.

we now work out two typical rst-order transition matrix elements using this non-
local description for a radiation eld. some of these results have appeared before [2b], but
are included here for the sake of completeness. first it must be mentioned that depending
on the photon ux and on the coherence properties of the laser eld, one must in general
describe the eld as

e = alel + anen

(13)

where the subscripts l and n refer to the local (usual) and the non-local elds respectively
(al and an are identical with ai and aii in eqn.(5)) ; the relative strength of the two
coecients would depend, essentially, upon the degree to which the response of the atomic
electron/s to the eld appears phase-correlated.

we work within the dipole approximation, and formulate the typical matrix element
of this two-photon absorption operator (i) for a single-electron atom, and (ii) for a two-
electron atom.

(i) for simplicity we conne ourselves to a single radiation mode |nki. dene

ti = hlf mf (x), nk  2|r.en (x, x)|li,mi(x), nki

(14)

where the ls are the orbital angular momenta in the initial and nal states. we use
equation (9b) for en (x, x) and note that the time integration in (14) for the non-local
interaction yields the required energy balance ef = ei + 2hk if and only if we use the

7

retarded interaction ; use of the advanced interaction fails to satisfy energy conservation.
(see appendix b for the mathematical details.) this remarkable result shows that causality
as we understand it  ability of the past, but not of the future, to inuence the present
 follows as a necessary condition for energy conservation in our non-local picture of the
electromagnetic eld ; we have obtained a non-thermodynamic arrow of time having a
purely quantum nature.

incidentally, energy conservation is satised even if we set the upper limit of the
integration over dt (eqn.(b3), appendix b) to t exactly, i.e. put c = , which corresponds
to an epr-like quantum entanglement. thus we nd, as had been mentioned in the
beginning, that such situations need not be left out from our non-local picture, and that
causality in a quantum system need not be restricted by the special theory of relativity.
however, if we go further in a closer analysis of the integration over dt, we nd that we
can make an even stronger statement. consider the case where |r r| > ct, in which case
the upper limit in the t-integral in (b3) becomes negative (remember that both r and r
extend over all space), and the integral vanishes, leading to non-conservation of energy !
thus in our non-local picture of the quantum world, attempts to combine causality with
the special theory of relativity are not only unnecessary, but can also lead to results which
do not agree with experience ; one is immediately led to think of bells theorem. note
that such an epr-like correlation between x and x is also indicated by the commutation
relation (a3) in appendix a, which gives the necessary condition for gauge invariance of
the non-local electromagnetic eld tensor.

finally we get (in atomic units)

ti = i

2i

c

hf (r)|r.(r, r)|i(r)i

(15)

as mentioned earlier, we use for (r, r) a power series in r and r with undetermined
coecients ; the specic form chosen is

(r, r) = (r + r)

anpn(r.r)



xn=0

(16)

(symmetry demands that the coecients of r and of r be identical.) putting i(r) =
ni

r ylimi(r) and similarly for f gives

ri(r)

ti = ininf 

2i

c r(i1 + i2)

(17)

where r is a radial integral, and the is are two angular integrals, one of which gives the
selection rule lf = li, while the other gives lf = li, li  2. (see appendix c for details.)
thus from (17) we obtain two-photon transitions of the type s  s, s  d. . . linear in
intensity. we also note that the squeezed vacuum corresponds to the limit   0 in eqn.
(11) ; an increase in , which results among other things in an increase in intensity, leads
to a deviation of the squeezed eld from the form (12) to a situation where the summation

8

over mode indexes runs over all integers (instead of only even or only odd integers as in
(10)), so that in the rst order, an increase in intensity in squeezed light-matter interaction
causes, progressively, single-photon transitions instead of the two-photon transitions as was
the case in the squeezed vacuum. this result exactly matches the observation of georgiades
et al [1]. other possible two-photon absorptions linear in intensity in a squeezed vacuum
can be trivially predicted. two possibilities immediately come to mind that should be
experimentally feasible : (i) two-photon ionisation of a rydberg atom, and (ii) two-photon
electron detachment from a negative ion, both with a squeezed vacuum. indeed, a whole
eld of non-destructive two-photon spectroscopy of atoms/molecules opens up.

at this point we should remark that the formal similarity between a squeezed eld and
a laser eld with strong second-order coherence can become misleading when we consider
the intensity variation of the elds interacting with matter. as we shall soon see, the higher
the intensity, the more phase-correlated does the classical (thermal or laser) radiation eld
appear to two detectors (e.g. two atomic electrons), or one detector at two dierent
times, rendering this non-local description the more valid. on the other hand, as we just
saw, increase in intensity in a squeezed vacuum takes us back, so to say, into the classical
domain (the two-photon transition becomes non-linear with increase in intensity).

(ii) for a two-electron atom we require a matrix element of the type

tii = hlf l

f

(x, x), nk  2|(r + r).en (x, x)|li,l

i

(x, x), nki

(18)

as before, the time integration in (18) yields the energy balance (ef , ei + 2hk), leaving

tii = i

2i

c

hf (r, r)|(r + r).(r, r)|i(r, r)i

to evaluate tii we use a correlated wavefunction of the form [9]

 = r 5

f(r)(r; , r, r)

2 x

where r = r2 + r2 and  = arctan (r/r) are the hyperspherical coordinates.

substituting eqns. (20) and (16) in (19) we obtain (see appendix d for details)

tii = i

(21)

we obtain the selection rules for lf and lf from the two angular integrals, one involv-

ing pk akpk(r.r) and the other involving pk akp1(r.r)pk(r.r). they are tedious but

9

straightforward ; note that although the coecients ak are unknown, the relative strength
of the two terms can be analytically obtained. for the rst integral, both l and l are
even for even k and odd for odd k, whereas for the second integral l and l turn out to
be odd for even k and even for odd k. thus nally we see that parity is conserved, as in
the single-electron case.

for carrying out the integration over d one can use the result [10]

z 1

 3f2(n, 1 +  +  + n, 1 +  + r; 1 + , 2 +  +  + r; 1)

(22)

on symmetry grounds, n = nf  ni is always even ; sample calculations show that the
integral over d is strongly peaked when nf = ni. we see therefore that this two-photon
transition maintains the radial correlation in the two-electron atom.

we can now summarise the properties of the matrix element t as follows :

(i) it is a two-photon excitation linear in the eld strength ;

(ii) it conserves the parity of the atom ;

(iii) for a two-electron atom, it conserves the degree of radial correlation.

in view of eqn.(13) this double excitation will be running, in general, parallel to
usual single-photon transitions in an experiment, and hence in any multiphoton excitation
process in a eld having a strong second-order coherence the overall transition would have
the form t t ddt d . . . or some such random mixture (ds are single-photon transition
moments), tending towards the extreme form t t t t . . . as the eld grows more intense.
if we start out with a closed-shell atom in an s-state, such a series of t -transitions would
result in the formation of strongly correlated doubly excited states which are known to
favour simultaneous double electron escape (wannier [11] ; see also the review articles of
fano [9] and rau [12]). this is to be contrasted with sequential two-electron escape, which
does not involve any electron correlation.

we now demonstrate briey that many of the features observed in multiphoton double
ionisation in atoms placed in strong laser elds can be shown to follow as natural conse-
quences of this non-local eld model. a fuller demonstration can be found in [2b]. as
mentioned at the outset, interaction of matter with a strong radiation eld ts into this
non-local picture if two photons are absorbed by an atom within a time interval t  1
 .
for practical purposes this requirement can be replaced by a more convenient one, namely
that in a time 1
 , the number of photons owing into and out of the volume v of the
atomic shell occupied by the outer electron/s be much larger than the number of these
outer electrons. thus for an n-(outer)-electron atom the condition reads

v i
c2  n

10

(23)

on the other hand, when the correlated motion of two electrons is involved (see discussion
after eqn.(22)), we have to remember that the laser electric eld should be signicantly
smaller than the coulomb elds within the atom, in order that the electrons can maintain
their mutual correlation. choosing a eld of order 102 a.u. gives us a crude estimate for
an upper limit

imax  1013 w/cm2

(24)

to the laser intensity upto which we can expect electron correlation in a two-electron atom
to be maintained.

we now examine some physical consequences of our model qed and compare them
with observed features in multiphoton ionisation (mpi) and above-threshold ionisation
(ati) experiments. earlier, the occurrence of a t t..-like chain was shown to lead to the
possibility of direct double ionisation (as opposed to sequential double ionisation) [13] ;
we now see that the possibility can materialise if and only if both the conditions (23) and
(24) are fullled. simple considerations show that for short wavelengths the two conditions
can become mutually exclusive, thus ruling out the possibility of direct double ionization
(ddi), whereas for long wavelengths both conditions (23) and (24) can be satised over
a broad range of intensities. there is a caveat, though ; for very large wavelengths the
condition (23) can be satised at quite low intensities, but the rather large number of ds
in the multiphoton excitation chain t t ddt d . . . will tend to spoil the electron correlation
pattern. also, for a given power output, the peak intensity in short laser pulses is higher
than in longer ones, and hence we should expect ddi to occur more readily with shorter
pulses than with long pulses. this accords with the observations of lhuillier et al [14]
who measured multiphoton ionisation in xenon using both nanosecond and picosecond
pulsed lasers at 1064 nm and 532 nm, and those of agostini and petite [15] and delone
et al [16] who measured mpi of ca at 1064 nm with picosecond pulses and nanosecond
pulses respectively. furthermore, yergeau et al [17] found that in mpi of rare gases using
a co2 laser ( = 9.55 and 10.55), the multiply charged ions are formed sequentially.

in a strong laser eld, another interesting eect stems from the photon number-phase
uncertainty relation n   1. the atomic electron/s during the two-photon excitation
is/are acting as a device that measures the incident radiation phase to within an accuracy
 = t. consequently the photon number would be uncertain by n  1
t , and this
would shift the photoelectron spectrum by an amount n h, resulting in the suppression
of n lower-order peaks. this is a very well-known phenomenon in ati (e.g.
[18]) ;
attempts to explain it have so far met with only partial success. note that in the case of
two electrons, they can act individually as such phase-measuring devices and no correlation
is required ; as such, this feature is not restricted by the condition (24).
indeed, peak
suppression (also known as quenching) has been observed at very high intensities ( 1016
w/cm2).

use of circularly polarised light lends a particularly interesting twist to this aspect.
a circularly polarised photon can be regarded as a superposition of two linearly polarised
components 90o apart in phase, and hence even if two circularly polarised photons arrive
with a phase gap t = 
2 between them, the x-component of one photon and the y-
component of the other can still be in exact phase correlation. this implies that the

11

 can be relaxed to t  1

coherence condition t  1
 , i.e. it would be satised at much
smaller intensities. thus at any given intensity, many more lower-order ati peaks can
be expected to be quenched by circularly polarised light than by linearly polarised light.
this feature has indeed been observed (e.g. bucksbaum et al [19], bashkansky et al [20]).
interestingly, this also allows us to predict that with a circularly polarised laser, onset
of ddi should occur in mpi experiments at lower intensities than with linearly polarised
lasers.

in conclusion, we nd that our non-local model of qed gives us a correlated two-
photon absorption which, unlike the conventional four-eld correlation function, occurs in
the rst order of perturbation and is therefore linear in intensity. a single rst-order matrix
element [ti, eqn.(17)] exactly reproduces the experimental nding of georgiades et al [1],
while in higher orders we obtain results that match very well with several experimental
ndings in mpi and ati of atoms. from a detailed work-out of the non-local qed
we obtain a non-thermodynamic arrow of time, and we also nd that correlations in a
quantum system must necessarily be of the epr-type, a result that agrees with bells
theorem. this non-local model qed can certainly be further improved upon by way of
rigour and sophistication, but we believe that, basically, we have been able to demonstrate
its usefulness.

appendix a

in this appendix we use relativistic notation, with units h = c = 1. let a0 and a
be the scalar and vector potentials of an electromagnetic eld. in eld theory, the four-
potential a  (a0, a) is usually introduced through imposition of the requirement of
covariance under a u (1) gauge transformation (of the type eie(x)), and this is done via
construction of the covariant derivative d =  +iea (a = g a, g being the metric
tensor) and replacement of the partial derivatives in the lagrangian (e.g. of a complex scalar
eld ) by these covariant derivatives. from this gauge-covariant lagrangian dd we
obtain the interaction lagrangian eja, where j = i(  ). (of course,
these as need not be a dynamical eld but can be a pure gauge eld as well [21] ; however,
this does not concern us here.)

a signicant point that is often lost sight of is that, in order to achieve gauge covari-
ance, it is not a necessary condition that this interaction lagrangian be local ; indeed,
we can write down a non-local lagrangian in a similar manner. consider a non-local
u (1) gauge transformation of the kind exp(ie|xihx|). it is easily seen that a covariant
derivative can be constructed as d =  + d + iea|xihx|, (where d  /x and
we have written a|xihx|  ga|xihx|), provided that a transforms under the gauge
transformation as
(a1)

a  a + |xihx| + d|xihx|.

it can be readily veried that this transformation property is consistent with the require-
ment of gauge invariance of the non-local (electromagnetic) eld tensor

f |xihx| = ( + d)a|xihx|  ( + d)a|xihx|

under this new gauge transformation, provided that

[, d] = 0.

(a2)

(a3)

ultimately, we have to replace a in the above-dened interaction lagrangian by
ga|xihx|. we see, therefore, that our non-local potential is consistent with the basic
requirement of gauge covariance of the lagrangian. our eqn. (1) for the matrix element
mf i(t) follows directly from this non-local interaction.

the nature of the correlation between x and x in this formulation is laid down by
the above commutation relation (a3), which indicates that x and x must be completely
independent, i.e. there is no restriction that their interval be time-like. we postpone a
detailed discussion of this point till later ; in connection with eqn. (14) we shall show
(see second paragraph after the eqn. in text) that energy conservation at the atomic level
requires that this correlation must, of necessity, be of the epr-type.

13

appendix b

we show in this appendix that only the retarded interaction can lead to energy con-

servation. the time-integral in (14), with retarded correlation, is given by

i

e



h (ef tht) dtz t/c



e i

z 
( = |r  r|), while with the advanced correlation we have
g(t) dt

h (eit+ht) dt =z 



f (t) dtz t/c



z 



f (t) dtz 

t+/c

g(t) dt

(say)

(b1)

(b2)

the expression (b1) can be written as a sum of two integrals :

z 0



f (t) dtz t/c



g(t) dt +z 

0

f (t) dtz t/c



g(t) dt

(b1)

while the expression (b2) can be written as

z 0



f (t) dtz 

t+/c

g(t) dt +z 

0

f (t) dtz 

t+/c

g(t) dt

(b2)

elementary considerations show that the rst integral in (b1) and the second integral in
(b2) contribute nothing, while the other two integrals are (to within factors) given by
(ef , ei + 2h). energy conservation in the two-photon transition thus results, as it were,
when we sum up our samplings of the phase of the matrix element over extended periods
of time.

we now come to the question of the signicance of the limits of the integrals over
dt. the matrix element is, so to say, created when we have photoexcited the atom ; let
us agree to dene that this act has been done at the instant t = 0. the crucial point to
remember is that although the photoexcitation is not an irreversible process (the atom can
certainly be de-excited again), our acts of exciting and subsequently observing the atom
are irreversible in time. therefore we can sample the phase (or whatever else we like to)
of the excitation matrix element only at times t  0. thus the rst integral in (b2),
although non-vanishing, is actually non-physical (it is just as meaningful as sampling the
behavioural pattern of a baby before the baby is born), and we are left with only one
non-vanishing integral in (b1)

z 

0

e

i

h (ef tht) dtz t/c



e i

h (eit+ht) dt

(b3)

thus energy conservation will be satised if and only if temporal correlation is provided
by the past, and not by the future ; we have derived an arrow of time in quantum physics
as a necessary condition for energy conservation.

we get the selection rules lf = li, li  2.

the materials in this appendix are standard, and are included only for the sake of
completeness. more details may be found in [9] (we have introduced some minor changes in

for each channel  in (20) we can write
