abstract

a renormalization scheme is suggested where qcd input parameters - quark
mass and coupling constant - are expressed in terms of gauge invariant and
infrared stable quantities. for the renormalization of coupling constant the
quark anomalous electromagnetic moment is used; the latter is calculated in a
two loop approximation. examination of the renormalized s matrix indicates
connement phenomenon already in the framework of perturbation theory.

usually, in the charge and the mass renormalization procedure the so-called mom scheme
is used, where the input parameters of the theory, appearing in action, are expressed in terms
of on mass-shell greens functions (itzykson and zuber, 1980; ramond, 1989). another widely
accepted scheme, ms, deals only with the divergent parts of the greens functions, not appealing
to any condition on momenta. evidently, due to the renormalization invariance, any scheme is
admissible.

in gauge theories like quantum electrodynamics (qed) and quantum chromodynamics
(qcd) the input parameters are considered to be gauge invariant and infrared stable (i.e.
not containing infrared divergences, generated by a massless gauge eld). let us for brevity
call any quantity with these properties a physical quantity. obviously, the observables, being
measurable, should be the physical quantities but the converse may be not true (as an example,
consider any function of eld strength f in qed). since greens functions are not infrared
stable and depend on a gauge (in general, their renormalization factors are nonlocal quantities
(basseto et al., 1987)), the interpretation of the results obtained from the schemes mentioned
above may be obscured. renormalized quantities may share undesirable properties, originated
from the dynamics of the nonphysical degrees of freedom and the extraction of the physical
information may be complicated.

therefore, from our point of view, in gauge theories the most illuminating would be a scheme
operating only with the physical degrees of freedom, thus allowing to avoid complications
mentioned above. the prescription is as follows: calculate in regularized theory as many
physical quantities as the input parameters are and express the latter in terms of physical
quantities. so, in qed as well as in qcd, containig only two input parameters - coupling
constant and the fermion mass (for illustrative purposes we consider here only one avor) - we
need the expressions for two physical quantities:

 = (g, m; n);  = (g, m; n),

(1)

where g0 and m0 are input parameters, the dependence of  on momenta, beinge irrelevant
here, is omitted, n is a space-time dimension and throughout this paper we use dimensional
regularization.
in qed and qcd  and  have no limit at n = 4 - regularization can
not be removed in (1). now resolve g0 and m0 in terms of ,  and n and substitute
into the expression for any other physical quantity . in renormalizable theories, after all
the calculations are performed,  becomes nite in terms of ,  - regularization can be
removed:

lim

(g, m; n) = lim
n

(g(, ; n), m(, ; n); n) =

this scheme, describing the renormalization procedure as the expression of physical quantities
in terms of physical quantities,1 allows to avoid any signicant diculties and seems most
transparent from the physical point of view.

1a similar procedure (in a dierent context) was discussed already in the early days of qed (dyson,
1949).

2

the aim of this paper is to develop such a scheme for qcd.
it is clear that we need two physical quantities. in (tarrach, 1981) it was demonstrated

that in the covariant gauge the solution of the equation

can be expressed in the framework of perurbation theory as

g1(p, m0, g0, ; n)in(p) = 0

m = m0 + g2

0m1(m0; n) + g4

0m2(m0; n) + ...,

(3)

(4)

where m1 and m2 do not depend on a gauge parameter  and are infrared stable. in (3), g is
a quark propagator and in(p) is the solution of the dirac equation (p  m)in(p) = 0. the
investigation in an axial gauge (japaridze et al., 1991) conrms the gauge invariance and the
infrared stability of m. in (japaridze et al., 1991) it was shown that up to order g6
0 the quark
propagator has a simple pole at p2 = m2. therefore, the quark pole mass can be considered
as on of the s in relations (1) and to complete the scheme we have to point out the another
physical quantity in qcd.

we propose the quark anomalous electromagnetic moment, dened, as usual, from the

amplitude of the quark elastic scattering on an external electromagnetic eld:

hp|j|p + kia(k) = in(p) f1(k2) +

i
2

[, ]kf2(k2)!in(p + k)a(k)

(5)

the anomalous electromagnetic moment  is dened as f2(0).

we calculate  up to order g6
terms of space-time dimension n:

0 regularizing all the divergences (ultraviolet and infrared) in

 = g2

01(m0; n) + g4

02(m0; n),

(6)

where i is the i-loop contribution. the gauge dependent terms cancel in i; 1 is infrared
stable and the infrared divergence appears in 2. to obtain the expression of order g4
0, containig
only g0-associated divergences, we must use the relation (see (4))

m0 = m  g2

0m1(m0; n) + o(g4

0) = m  g2

0m1(m; n) + o(g4
0)

in (6), i.e. reexpand the loop expressions:

 = g2

01(m  g2

02(m; n) =

0m1(m; n); n) + g4
0 2(m; n)  m1

g2
01(m; n) + g4

1(m; n)

m !

(7)

this reexpansion generates the infrared divergent tern 1/m which cancels the infrared
divergent term in 2.

so,  is gauge invariante and infrared stable. omitting the intermediary calculations, we

quote the nal result:

where ca  n, cf  (n 2  1)/2n are the invariants of su(n) group, g2  g2
0n4 is the
dimensionless coupling constant,  is the mass scale, appearing in the framework of dimensional
regularization (itzykson and zuber, 1980; ramond, 1989), nf is the number of avors, m is the
pole mass of the scattered quark, the external momenta obey p2 = (p + k)2 = m2 and for the
nite part  see the appendix.

thus from the point of view of renormalization procedure qed and qcd do not dier - in
both of theories the input parameters can be expressed in terms of physical quantities. surely,
any scheme can be used but our goal was to demonstrate that it is possible to renormalize
qcd coupling constant in terms of physical degrees of freedom. the scheme is described by
the relations:

m0 = m0(m, ; n), g0 = g0(m, ; n)

(9)

to use (9) we need the numerical values of  and m. the gauge invariance and the infrared
stability of these quantities does not mean necessarily that they are directly measurable, but
these properties guarantee that the numerical values of  and m can be extracted from the
experimental data. of course, the numerical values of  and m depend not only on m0 and
g0 but also on all other input parameters of, say, the standard model, but for the considered
problem it is enough to analyze only qcd corrections.

the scheme (9) may be not suitable from the point of view of numerical convergence - the
rate of convergence depends on the numerical values of  and m. to improve the convergence,
one has to introduce the so-called eective parameters (itzykson and zuber, 1980; ramond,
1989) gr and mr, i.e. to move to another scheme. it has to be pointed out that some statements
formulated in terms of eective parameters (say, the increasing of the of the qcd eective
coupling constant in the infrared region, sometimes interpretted as a physical eect of increasing
the force between quarks at large distances) are scheme dependent and are not valid in another
scheme. in other words, since the eective parameters are chosen arbitrarily, they can not aect
the physical results.

to see this, let us illustrate how the renormalization group equation and the renormalization
it is transparent in the framework of dimensional
scheme arise in a quantum eld theory.

(14)

the renormalization scheme is specied by the relation (12); then from (14) we obtain the
appropriate -function. for example, the choice

g2 = c1(n)g2

r() + c2(n)g4

r() + ...

results in

(16)

the schemes are labelled by particular choices of ci (e.g ms is obtained if we choose ci =
ai/(n  4)). the introduction of mr() is based on the same argumentation.

so, the behavior of the eective charge dened through any particular scheme (e.g. leading
to asymptotic freedom), being scheme dependent, may not lead to any valuable results - the
behavior and numerical values of eective parameters depend on our choice and are not dened
from the theory alone.

thus, the advantage of scheme (9), besides gauge invariant and infrared stability is that
it does not operates with the eective parameters, allowing us to avoid conclusions which are
insignicant from the physical point of view.

as it becomes evident, the behavior of gr and mr does not lead to a scheme-independent
statements, e.g. the absence of quarks and gluons in the asymptotic states. on the other hand,
from the renormalizability ofqcd it follows that in the expansion of any physical quantity 
(say, wilson loop)

(17)

the coecients , j are gauge invariant, infrared stable and contain no ultraviolet divergences
at n = 4, i.e. , j are nite.

so, the following question arises: are the quark and gluon degrees of freedom observable,

i.e. do quarks and gluons appear in asymptotic states?

the answer may be obtained from the examination of the scattering matrix. we suggest
the following criterion: if at least one s-matrix element built up in terms of elds is nite, the
appropriate quanta appear in asymptotic states as a particles.

in qed it is well known that the electron elastic sacttering amplitude is infrared divergent
and taking into account the emission of photons leads to the cancellation of these infrared
singularities - only the inclusive cross sections are nite (itzykson and zuber, 1980; ramond,
1989). that is why we can say that from the dirac-maxwell equations it follows the existence
of electrons and photons as an observable particles. of course, we a priori know that they exist
and the s-matrix analysis is in accordance with the experimental data.

we consider the s-matrix element of scattering of quark on an external electromagnetic
eld. note rst that the existence of a physical quantity   f2(0) (see (5)) does not mean at

5

all that the amplitude of the elastic sacttering is nite - in a full analogy with qed, the infrared
divergences remain in the elastic amplitude after the charge and the mass renormalization is
performed. let us consider the gluon emission, assuming that the inclusive cross section might
be nite. according to the lsz reduction technique (itzykson and zuber, 1980; ramond, 1989),
for a gluon with the momentum q and the polarization (q) in an asymptotic state we have

(18)

where d is the gluon propagator and z 1/2
is the gluon wave function renormalization factor.
in order g2 the contribution of the gauge eld in the residue z3 is (itzykson and zuber, 1980;
ramond, 1989)

where  is the eulers function (bateman and erdelyi, 1973). the factor z3 contributes to the
qcd coupling constant renormalization. to obtain the expression for the amplitude we have to
perform all the calculations before the regularization is removed: renormalize m0 and g0 using
(9), use (as we did for the amplitude (5)) the conditions p2 = (p + k)2 = m2, q2 = 0 and then
set n = 4. the condition q2 = 0 means that z a
3 (0) can be equated to zero. this is analogous to
the procedure of vanishing of integrals corresponding to a tadpole-type diagrams in a massless
theory- because of the analyticity of theory in n we can always nd the region where the result
is well-dened and then continue analytically in the desired region of n (itzykson and zuber,
1980; ramond, 1989). so

z3(q2) = z a

3 (q2) + z f ermion

(20)

at q2  0. this means that only part of the g0 renormalization constant, namely ca/2  2nf /3
is restored (compare to (11ca  2nf )/3 in expression (8)).
in other words, z3(0) does not
renormalize g0.

therefore, if we consider the gluon emission in order to cancel the infrared divergences of
the elastic scattering amplitude, the ultraviolet divergence appears and the cross section in
order g4 contains an unavoidable innity. the s-matrix is the same in any scheme but the
result is transparent while using the scheme (9), manipulating only with the physical degrees
of freedom and not using the eective parameters.

though the discussuin above is not a proof, it can be considered as an indication on a
connement phenomenon already in the framework of perturbation theory.
in other words,
qcd might be an example of a eld theory where elds do not necessarily refer to the physical
particles 2.

2 long time ago schwinger (schwinger, 1962), starting from the idea that elds are more fundamental
entities than particles, realized this conjencture in a two-dimensional electrodynamics, where the
particles, corresponding to fermionic degrees of freedom, are absent in asymptotic states.

6

the next step would be the consideration of the scattering of colorless bound states. at the

present time we have no denite result for this problem.

to conclude, in qcd it is possible to dene renormalization procedure operating only in
the space of physical degrees of freedom. though the relations (9) guarantee that the physical
quantities built up in terms of quark and gluon elds are nite, this is not enough for the
existence of these eld quanta as physical particles. the examination of the quark scattering
amplitude indicates that quark and gluon eld quanta do not appear in asymptotic states.
