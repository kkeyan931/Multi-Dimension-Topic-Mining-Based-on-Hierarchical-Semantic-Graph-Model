abstract

we consider a version of the adsd+1/cf td correspondence, in which the bulk space
is taken to be the quotient manifold adsd+1/ with a fairly generic discrete group 
acting isometrically on adsd+1. we address some geometrical issues concerning the
holographic principle and the uv/ir relations. it is shown that certain singular struc-
tures on the quotient boundary sd/ can aect the underlying physical spectrum. in
particular, the conformal dimension of the most relevant operators in the boundary
cft can increase as  becomes large. this phenomenon also has a natural ex-
planation in terms of the bulk supergravity theory. the scalar two-point function is
computed using this quotient version of the ads/cft correspondence, which agrees
with the expected result derived from conformal invariance of the boundary theory.

introduction

the ads/cft correspondence proposed in [1][2][3] gives a surprisingly powerful method
to investigate strong coupling physics. in its simplest form, this proposal relates tree-level
supergravity on (d + 1)-dimensional anti-de sitter space to a conformal eld theory on the
round sphere sd, which is the conformal boundary of adsd+1. one may consider cft on
a more complicated manifold m as well, by replacing the bulk spacetime adsd+1 with a
negatively curved einstein space x of boundary m. in fact, using topologically non-trivial
x can provide additional tests for the bulk/boundary correspondence [4][5][6].

there are several ways of constructing a non-trivial einstein manifold with negative cos-
mological constant. one way is to place black holes in ads space. this amounts to a study of
the boundary theory at nite temperature [4]. while this construction can exhibit interesting
phase structures in the large n limit (using a mechanism discovered by hawking and page
[7] many years ago), nding black hole solutions in the ads background is however by no
means an easy task; at present only a few such solutions are explicitly known.

alternatively, we can pick a discrete subgroup  of so(d, 2) that acts isometrically on
adsd+1, and take the quotient manifold x = adsd+1/ to be the bulk spacetime. the
resulting space will constitute a (d + 1)-dimensional negatively curved einstein manifold, on
which the classical supergravity action can be dened. one thus expects that gravity in x
still corresponds to some conformal eld theory on the quotient boundary m = sd/. for
a check on this quotient version of the ads/cft correspondence, recall that the hawking-
page reference space (denoted by x1 in [3][4]) takes the form adsd+1/z, which is associated
to a boundary cft in low-temperature phase. another useful check concerns a quotient
construction of the btz black hole [8] in ads3, where  is generated by a single loxodromic
element; supergravity in this geometry is again related to a 2d cft (see e.g. [9] for such a
study and the references therein). note that these examples made a common choice of  in
elementary discrete groups.

in the present work we wish to consider some geneal features of the quotient ads/cft
correspondence. we will address a couple of geometrical issues that are closely related to
the holographic principle [10] and the uv/ir relations [11][12] between bulk- and boundary-
theories. as we will see in detail, certain singular structures on the quotient boundary sd/
may aect the underlying physical spectrum. this eect could not be seen by choosing  in
elementary discrete groups; mathematically such a choice is too special to describe generic
structures of quotient manifolds. thus, in this paper we will take  to be non-elementary,

2

namely it contains no abelian subgroups of nite index. with this choice the conformal
dimension of the most relevant operators in the boundary cft will depend nontrivially
on , provided  is large enough. we will give some mathematical explanations of such a
dependence, both on the supergravity side and from the boundary point of view. according to
this dependence we could have, for  extremely large, a boundary theory that does not contain
any relevant operators,  corresponding to a bulk supergravity theory without tachyon
modes.

the existence of singular structures on the boundary and its relations to the bulk geometry
have been extensively studied by mathematicians. some of the mathematical results will be
reviewed in this paper. section 2 provides a brief description of the quotient space geometry.
in section 3, we discuss several implications of the holographic principle as well as certain
geometrical subtleties arising from constructing the quotient boundary. section 4 then deals
with scalar conformal elds on the quotient boundary, where we derive a constraint on the
spectrum of conformal dimensions. in section 5 we compute the scalar two-point function
using the quotient ads/cft correspondence. finally, in section 6 we present our conclusions.

2 taking the quotient

we will acturally work in euclidean language and take the covering space of our bulk to be
the (d + 1)-dimensional hyperbolic space hd+1 = so(d + 1, 1)/so(d + 1). this is a complete,
simply connected riemannian manifold with negative constant curvature and having so(d +
1, 1) as its isometry group. a particularly useful description of hd+1 is the open half-space
model, which has the standard hyperbolic metric ds2 = |dx|2/x2

0 and the boundary sphere

sd  rd  {}  rd

(2.1)

at innity, here the d-dimensional plane rd is specied by the equation x0 = 0.

geometrically, there is a simple realization of isometric transformations in this half-space
model [13]. suppose that s is a d-dimensional euclidean hemisphere in the half-space whose
equatorial plane coincides with the boundary plane rd in (2.1). the inversion in s, which
will be denoted by is, is an orientation-reversing isometry of hd+1. in the limiting case when
s approaches a d-dimensional euclidean half-plane in hd+1 perpendicular to the boundary
plane, the inversion is becomes an ordinary reection, which again is an orientation-reversing
isometry. to obtain an orientation-preserving isometry, one simply takes product of an even

3

number of such iss. it turns out that each isometry of the hyperbolic space can be realized
in this way, namely for any g  so(d + 1, 1), we can nd 2n hemispheres s1,s2,   ,s2n as
described above (possibly including those in the euclidean half-plane limit), so that

g = is1is2   is2n.

(2.2)

note that each inversion is : hd+1  hd+1 on the hyperbolic space induces a transformation
i s : sd  sd on the boundary (2.1), dened by the inversion in  s, where s is the closure
of s whose boundary  s is a (d  1)-dimensional euclidean sphere (or euclidean plane in
the limiting case) living in (2.1). thus group elements of the form (2.2) also act naturally on
the boundary sphere, giving the so-called mobius transformations [13].

now we choose a discrete subgroup  of so(d + 1, 1). discreteness means that each
   has a neighborhood u  so(d + 1, 1) such that u   = {}. so every sequence
of innitely many distinct elements {n} in  cannot converge to any point of so(d + 1, 1)
n||n|| = . evidently, any element of  has a product
and, in particular, we have lim
represention (2.2) in terms of inversions. this species how  acts on hd+1 in the half-space
description. the (d + 1)-dimensional bulk spacetime x is then constructed by

x = hd+1/.

(2.3)

if  does not contain elements of nite order, then it acts freely on hd+1, so that x is a
smooth hyperbolic manifold without orbifold singularities.

since  acts isometrically on hd+1, the local geometry of x looks the same as the original
hyperbolic geometry. in particular x inherits the standard hyperbolic metric from hd+1. of
course, taking the quotient (2.3) will generally break the isometry group so(d + 1, 1). the
residual spacetime symmetry on x will be determind by1:

g = {g  so(d + 1, 1)

| g    g1  ,    }.

(2.4)

in the quotient version of the ads/cft correspondence, this isometry group should be
identied with the unbroken conformal symmetry of the boundary theory. an independent
verication of this fact will be given at the end of section 5.

1a quick derivation of this group is as follow. each point x of x can be considered as an orbit [y]    y
in hd+1, starting at some y in the hyperbolic space. the action of g  so(d + 1, 1) on x is dened by
x 7 g  x  [g  y], which is well-dened provided [g  y] is independent of the choice of representive y in the
orbit; thus, if y  =   y is another representive, there should exist a     such that g  y  =    (g  y). the
collection of all such g is precisely the isometry group of x.

4

from the boundary point of view, it is natural to regard  as a discrete group of certain
mobius transformations acting on the boundary sphere sd. thus the quotient boundary
is constructed by

m = sd/.

(2.5)

in contrast to the previous case, m in general does not inherit any metric from sd, as generic
mobius transformations cannot preserve such a metric. nevertheless, this quotient space does
inherit a conformal structure from sd.

3 holography and singular structures

at this point, one expects naturally that supergravity on the bulk x should correspond to a
conformal eld theory living in the d-dimensional space m, dened by (2.5). the geometry
of this boundary space is quite clear in examples with elementary discrete groups [3][4][9].
for generic , however, there may exist some subtleties that at rst sight will raise a puzzle,
as we can see in the following extreme case.

generally speaking, taking the quotient of hd+1 by a discrete group  will cause reduction
of the spacetime volume v  v /||. for nite groups this reduction is invisible because of
v =  in the hyperbolic metric. but when  is chosen to be large enough, we can actually
make the quotient space volume v ol(x) nite. in this case, x may be viewed as a regulated
version of the original ads-space hd+1, with a certain -invariant infrared cuto imposed2.
at the same time, the boundary manifold m will inherit a similar interpretation: it simply
regulates the volume of the original ads-boundary sd by some long-distance cuto.
if
this m were the regulated space on which the corresponding boundary theory lives, then we
would have a regularization prescription that violates the uv/ir relations [3][11][12] between
bounadry- and bulk- theories, and thus conicts with the holographic principle proposed in
[10].

the above puzzle may be stated in a slightly dierent way. we start from a classical
conformal eld theory dened on the ads-boundary sd. the quantum version of this theory
can be regularized by an ultraviolet cuto so that it lives on a discrete subspace of sd. there
may exist many dierent lattice models of the boundary sphere, but according to the uv/ir
relations [3][11][12], only one such discrete subspace m can correspond to the given infrared

2the cuto may be thought of as the length scale of a fundamental domain for .

5

regulating hd+1  x of the bulk, as long as v ol(x) < 3. since this m arises from an
ultraviolet (rather than infrared) cuto of sd, in general we should have m 6= m and, since
the cuto has a -invariant meaning, m is likely to be a subset of m. thus, supergravity on
the quotient bulk space x should generally correspond to a boundary theory on m other
than on the quotient boundary (2.5).

there is an interesting consequence of the above discussion. if v ol(x) < , the ultra-
violet cuto completely breaks the conformal algebra on sd, so holography predicts that the
residual symmetry (2.4) will at most constitute a discrete group . this is in accordance with
the mathematical speculation that generic hyperbolic manifolds with nite volumes admit
no continuous isometries. continuous isometries can arise only if the volume of x is innite.
so far we have only considered an extreme case that can occur in the ads/cft corre-
spondence: when v ol(x) < , one naively expects that conformal elds should be dened
on the quotient boundary m = sd/, but turning to the quantum theory a rather intrigu-
ing, apparantly discrete space m  m can possibly emerge as the regulated spacetime. it
would be of interest to have a geometrical understanding of why the boundary of x can be
discretized as one deforms  from generic position into this extreme case.

the crucial point is that the action of a discrete   so(d + 1, 1) on hd+1 may behave
very dierently from that on the boundary sphere sd. one can show that  always acts
discontinuously4 on hd+1. in fact, if this is not the case, then we can nd certain x  hd+1
and a sequence of innitely many distinct elements {n} in , such that n(x) coverges to
some y  hd+1. since hd+1 can be regarded as the coset space so(d + 1, 1)/so(d + 1),
the points x and y in the hyperboloic space may be represented by some group elements
gx  gx  hx and gy  gy  hy in so(d + 1, 1), respectively, up to arbitrary hx, hy  so(d + 1).
thus, the limit n(x)  y can be alternatively described by ngx = gn(x)hn with gn(x)  gy
and hn  so(d + 1). this clearly gives n = gn(x)  hn  g1
x . now because gn(x) has a nite
limit gy as n  , and because the hns belong to a compact group so(d + 1), we see that
||n|| is bounded from above. but this is impossible due to discreteness of . so as far as 
is discrete, its action on hd+1 is necessarily discontinuous5. accordingly the quotient space
3if v ol(x) = , x does not really regulate hd+1 through an infrared cuto, so m  needs not to be
4we say that  acts discontinuously on a space y provided for every compact subset k of y , the condition
(k)  k =  holds except for nitely many   . thus a nite group acts on y discontinuously. if 
is innite and acts discontinuously on y , then for all y  y as well as 1, 2, . . .  , the sequence {n(y)}
cannot converge to any point of y . see section 5.3 of [13] for a more detailed discussion.

discrete.

5see [13] for a somewhat dierent proof of this result in the case d = 2.

x = hd+1/ with its natural quotient topology is always a hausdor space.

on the contrary, a discrete group  in general does not act discontinuously on the bound-
ary of hd+1 and there may exist accumulation (or cluster) points in each -orbit, namely,
given any x on the boundary sphere sd, one may nd an innite sequence {n} in  such
n(x)  sd. these points may render the quotient space sd/ possible to be non-
that lim
n
hausdor. the set of all such accumulation points is called the limit set  of . this set is
a closed, -invariant subset of sd; actually it is the smallest non-empty subset having such
properties. thus  is contained in the closure of an orbit   x, with x either on the bound-
ary sphere or in the interior of the hyperbolic space. note that if   , then   .
hence a large  actually means that  has a relatively large hausdor dimension.

let us give an example to illustrate how the limit set of  can have positive hausdor
dimension. this example comes from a slight modication of the material exposed in [14]. as
we have mentioned before, the action of  on the hyperbolic space is generated by inversions
with respect to some d-dimensional euclidean hemispheres (or half-planes) in hd+1. we
restrict ourselves to a simple case in which only nitely many such hemispheres can occur.
thus, for i = 1, 2, . . . , k + 1, let si be a d-dimensional euclidean hemisphere with center ai
and euclidean radius ri, and let bi be the (d + 1)-dimensional euclidean half-ball bounded
by si, whose closure is denoted by bi. suppose that these half-balls are mutually disjoint,
namely for each pair (i, j), |ai  aj| > ri + rj. then the discrete group  which we will
consider consists of all elements of the form

i1i2...i2n = ii1ii2   ii2n1ii2n,

(i1, i2, . . . , i2n)  (2n)

(3.1)

where ii is the inversion in si, (m) denotes the set of all sequences i1, . . . , im such that
1  i1, i2, . . . , im  k + 1 and i1 6= i2, i2 6= i3, . . . , im1 6= im (that is, adjacent indices have
dierent values). since all the half-balls do not touch each other, we have ii( bj)  bi for
i 6= j, and therefore

bi1i2...i2n+1  i1i2...i2n( bi2n+1)  bi1,

 (i1, i2 . . . i2n+1)  (2n + 1).

(3.2)

moreover, it is not dicult to see that (3.2) itself is a closed half-ball in hd+1  sd, with the
center ai1i2...i2n+1 and radius ri1i2...i2n+1 determined iteratively by

ai1i2...im = ai1 

r2

ri1i2...im =

where m  2 and (i1, i2, . . . , im)  (m). it follows from the (geometrically obvious) inequal-
i2...im  (|ai1  ai2...im|  ri2...im)2  (|ai1  ai2|  ri2)2 that the radius
ities |ai1  ai2...im|2  r2
of bi1i2...i2n+1 will shrink to zero when n tends to innity. thus, the following closed set

e =

\n=1

[

(i1i2...i2n+1)  (2n+1)

bi1i2...i2n+1

(3.4)

is a subset of the boundary sphere sd and, by construction, it is the smallest non-empty
closed subset of sd invariant under the action of . so e is precisely the limit set . since
(3.4) constitutes a kind of the general cantor sets [15], its hausdor dimension dh(e)
obeys [14]

dh(e)  ck log k

(3.5)

where ck is some positive constant. thus, for k  2, the limit set of  indeed has a positive
hausdor dimension. (in the case k = 1 when  becomes an elementary group, we have
dh(e) = 0 and e consists only of two points.)

returning to generic case, we see that m = sd/ is not a hausdor space. it is not quite
clear how to quantize classical conformal elds on a non-hausdor space. so when we try to
associate a quantized boundary theory to (semi-) classical gravity on the bulk spacetime
x, we have to discard the singular points on m that cause the quotient boundary to be non-
hausdor, and consider the maximal subset m of m such that m is topologically a haustor
space. this naturally leads us to the notation of domain of discontinuity, d, dened as the
-invariant open set d = sd  . the group  now acts properly disontinuously on d
and we propose that the regulated boundary m is to be constructed as

m = d/,

(3.6)

plus possible cusps of  living outside d. we will call such m as the kleinian boundary
of x. geometrically, the quotient (3.6) can be interpreted as the boundary of the kleinian
manifold (hd+1  d)/ [16]. any point on sd living in the limit set will come from an
interior point x of hd+1 under a certain limit limn n(x), n  . so when taking the
quotient (2.3) by , a point y    sd can hardly be thought of as a boundary point of
the quotient space x, unless y is a cusp.

thus, if  contains no parabolic elements or, more generally, if  has a fundamental
domain in hd+1 that does not touch the limit set (so that all possible cusps are in d), then
the kleinian boundary of x is just the d-dimensional hausdor space (3.6). on the other

8

hand, if  has cusps not living in d, they should be regarded as additional points of the
kleinian boundary m. these additional points may become important when  is so large
that all the connected components of d collapse.
in that case the hausdor dimension
of the limit set reaches its maximal value d and m is discretized or even becomes empty.
typically this can occur when x has nite volume or is compact. we thus nd a geometrical
resolusion of the apparent puzzle mentioned at the begining of this section. the puzzle can
be removed simply by requiring that the quotient version of the ads/cft correspondence
should relate supergravity in x to a holographic theory dened on the kleinian boundary
m, and not on the naive quotient space m = sd/.

we now elucidate the above discussions by some examples. the most familiar example
concerns a nitely generated fuchsian group of the rst kind [17]. this is a discrete subgroup
of p sl(2, r) acting on h2 as well as on its boundary r, whose limit set  turns out to
be the whole r and hence the domain of discontinuity d is empty. to get an intuitive
picture of what the kleinian boundary of the riemann surface x = h2/ should look
like, let us consider the typical case where the canonical fundamental domain f for  has a
nite hyperbolic volume. then according to [17], f has 4g + s + p (nitely many) vertices,
4g of which are used to create genus of x, s of which correspond to elliptic xed points,
and p of which sit on r, corresponding to cusps. each elliptic xed point is associated to
a nite cyclic subgroup of , hence giving rise to an orbifold singularity in the interior of
the riemann surface. if we pick local coordiates z (with |z| < 1) at an elliptic xed point,
then a locally analytic function f will behave as f (z)  z1/ at that point, where  is the
order of the cyclic subgroup associated to the elliptic xed point. on the other hand, if we
pick local coordinates at a cusp, we will nd f (z)  log z near that cusp; thus the riemann
surface x has p innitely long tubes and the cusps can be thought of as the ends of these
tubes at innity. intuitively, the boundary of x should be identied with the set of cusps,
in agreement with our construction of the kleinian boundary since in this example d = .
this discretization was predicted earlier by the holographic argument.

as another example, we consider some torsion-free discrete subgroups of p sl(2, c) acting

on h3 and on the boundary sphere s2 = c  c  {}. let us begin with a  for which
the limit set  constitutes a circle s1 in the extended complex plane c [16]. in this case,
the domain of discontinuity d = d+
  d has two connected components (disks) d ,
separated from each other by that circle. since  acts properly discontinuously on d, the
quotient space m = d/ is a surface with two components m = d /, which inherits a

9

comformal structure from d. intuitively, this surface gives the main body of the boundary
of x = h3/ and in fact it is the continuous part of the kleinian boundary. the volume of
x is innite since m has nonzero area.

now we will focus on what can happen when  is deformed into a limiting group  so that
v ol(h3/) < . suppose that  arises as the fundamental group of a certain riemann
surface m. according to [18], under a quasi-conformal deformation of  the limit set 
is also deformed, from the circle s1 to a jordan curve in c, and the conformal structures
j of m departure from their original positions in teichmuller space. the limiting group
 can be obtained by moving j simultaneously towards two boundary points j() of
teichmuller space. one of the boundary points, say j+(), is determined by pinching a
lamination + of m and, if we pick another lamination  such that  ll up m, then
by pinching  we can get the other boundary point, j(). as j approach j(), the
jordan curve  becomes more and more complicated,  it can eventually ll the whole
complex plane when the double limit is reached [18]. the hyperbolic structure of the nal
quotient space x = h3/ is typically described by thurstons mapping torus constructed
from identifying (m, 1) to ((m), 0) in the cylinder m  [0, 1], where  : m  m is
a dieomorphism and when it is regarded as a transformation of teichmuller space, it xes
precisely the two boundary points j(). obviously, the resulting mapping torus has no
boundary if m is compact. this can be expected since d =  and  has no cusps for a
compact m. cusps of  can arise if m is not compact. the set of all such cusps should
now be identied with the kleinian boundary of x, and thus we have a concrete model to
see how m can be discretized during the limiting process   . again, these geometrical
considerations are consistent with the holographic prediction given at the begining of this
section: nite-volume bulk space has a discrete kleinian boundary.

before leaving these examples let us consider the cusped manifolds [17][16][18] in some
detail. suppose that x is a (d + 1)-dimensional hyperbolic manifold in either of the above ex-
amples (thus d = 1, 2), having nite volume v ol(x) and containing p cusps. mathematically,
there is a lower bound for the hyperbolic volume:

v ol(x)  cd  p

(3.7)

where cd is some constant of order 1, which may depend on what the example we are consider-
ing,  in the 2-dimensional example we have [17] c1 = 2 and, in the 3-dimensional example
[20], c2  1.01494. according to our geometrical construction, the kleinian boundary m of

10

x should be discretized completely in this nite volume case, consisting of the p cusps. the
average spacing of points in such a lattice boundary space should behave as

xk  p1/d.

(3.8)

note that (3.8) also has an interpretation as the uncertainty of localizing a spacetime point
in the boundary theory. going to the bulk manifold, the local geometry of x reads

u 2
r2 dx2
so the volume of x may be estimated roughly

ds2 =

k +

r2
u 2 du 2,

v ol(x)  z u

0

du u d1  (u)d

(3.9)

(3.10)

with u being an eective infrared cuto of the bulk manifold, which can be identied with
the length scale of a fundamental domain f  hd+1 for . now we combine (3.7), (3.8) and
(3.10) to derive

xk  u  dcd  1.

(3.11)

one recognizes immediately that (3.11) is the uv/ir relation in string units, reformulated
as a kind of the space-time uncertainty principle [19] . this gives further evidence that our
geometrical construction of m can serve as the space on which the holographic theory lives.
the discussion also suggests that cusps are capable of storing physical information.

4 conformal fields on the boundary

having established a mathematical description for the kleinian boundary of x, we shall try
to explore some unusual behavior of the boundary conformal elds. in particular we want to
show how the physical spectrum can depend nontrivially on a generic discrete group . here,
for simplicity, we will only consider conformal elds without lorentz indices; our discussion
can be easily generalized to the case containing several lorentz quantum numbers.

we begin with conformal transformations of scalar elds on the kleinian boundar m. for
this discussion we need only to consider the continuous part d/ of m, ignoring all cusps.
so given any f in the conformal group (2.4), a scalar eld o(x) of conformal dimension 
will transform as

f o(x) uf = |f(x)| o(f x)
o(x)  of (x)  u1
11

(4.1)

where u is some unitary representation of the conformal group and |f(x)| is the euclidean
distortion, dened through |f x  f y|2 = |f(x)|  |f(y)|  |x  y|2 for any x, y  rd.

if  6= 0, one cannot really think of o(x) as an oprator-valued distribution since it depends

on the choice of a riemannian metric on d/. in particular under weyl transformation

hij  hij = e2w  hij

(4.2)

the eld o(x) will get rescaled, o  eo = ew  o. in certain applications one may wish to

nd an intrinsic description for conformal elds in the sense that it does not depend on the
choice of riemannian metrics. for this purpose, we will invoke the concept of conformal
densities considered in [21]. recall that [21] a conformal density of dimension  is some
positive nite measure  assigned to the given metric hij, and under the weyl rescaling (4.2),
it obeys a transformation law6

d  d = ew  d.

(4.3)

thus, by taking a measurable subset a of d/, one can form an integral invariant under
weyl transformations:

o(a)  za o(x) d(x),

a  d/.

(4.4)

this clearly gives the desired intrinsic discription for o(x). note that the existence of such a
description is essential for formulating the explicit ads/cft correspondence [2][3]. in that
connection, the conformal density d(x) will serve as a source coupled to the local eld o(x)
on the boundary. the coupling should be conformally invariant by physical requirements.

one can lift elds from the quotient manifold d/ to its covering space d and regard
o(x)u = o(x),

o(x) as a conformal eld o(x) on d, obeying the -invariant condition u1
or, equivalently:



(4.5)
to lift (4.4), let a denote the covering space of a and suppose that f  d is a fundamental
domain for . since the images of f under the action of  tesselate d, we have

o(x) = |(x)|  o(x),

  .

o( a)  z a
= x

o(x) d(x) = x
z
f a

z(f a)
o(x) d(x) = z

o(x) d(x)

o(x) d(x),

(4.6)

f a

6mathematically, this transformation law should be understood as a constraint on the two assignments

derivative d 

d to be ew.

where  is a conformal density on d, of dimension , and

d(x) = x|(x)|  d(x)

(4.7)

stands for the -invariant projection of d(x), which may be identied with a conformal
density on d/ having the same dimension as d(x). hence the last integral in (4.6) can
be regarded as the integral (4.4) under the identications f  a  a and d  d.

as d constitutes a subset of sd, the measure d(x) has a natural extension to the whole
boundary sphere; hence the projection (4.7) denes a -invariant conformal density on sd.
now for generic , the existence of such an invariant measure will impose a constraint on
the allowed values of . in fact, if  is a non-elementary discrete group, then according to
corollary 4 of [21], the dimension of any conformal density on sd invariant under  has a
lower bound. this bound can be saturated and agrees with the critical exponent () of ,
which is dened so that the poincare series

g(x, y; s) = x

exp(s (x, y))

(x, y  hd+1, s  r)

(4.8)

converges for s > () and diverges for s < (), here (,) is the hyperbolic distance. as a
consequence, scalar conformal elds on m are not intrinsically dened in the sense of (4.4)
unless their conformal dimensions obey the inequality

  ().

(4.9)

if there are no stronger constraints presented,  can saturate the lower bound in (4.9), so in
this case the conformal dimension of the most relevant operators on m is ().

the above argument rests on the requirement that all conformal elds on d/ should
have an intrinsic description. however, there exits other evidence supporting the constraint
(4.9). consider, for example, a string theory in hd+1  w which corresponds to some cft
on the boundary of hd+1. with a suitable choice of w we may assume this string theory
contains zero-branes. each zero-brane on the boundary sphere sd with mass m is associated

to a local conformal eld o(x), whose dimension is determined by  = (d + d2 + 4m2)/2.
the two-point greens function g(x, y)  < o(x)o(y) > can be computed within the bulk
theory: for   m  1, we have

g(x, y)  exp(m (x, y))  exp( (x, y)).

(4.10)

13

note that (4.10) should be regularized by moving x, y slightly from the boundary of hd+1

to its interior. with this regularization the poincare series g(x, y)  p g(x, y) is
biautomorphic, that is, g(1x, 2y) = g(x, y) for any 1, 2  . (this follows from the
fact that  acts isometrically on the hyperbolic space, so in particular we have (x, y) =
(x, y),   .) it is therefore tampting to interprete g(x, y) as a regularized two-point
greens function of certain cft dened on the quotient manifold m  sd/. evidently,
this interpretation can work only if g(x, y) converges. when g(x, y) < , it is possible to
construct a local conformal eld o(x) on m such that < o(x)o(y) > is regularized to
be g(x, y), by a generalized osterwalder-schrader quantization procedure. the conformal
dimension  of such an o(x) should then obey (4.9). actually, from (4.8) and (4.10), one
easily derives

g(x, y)  g(x, y; ),

(4.11)

so convergence of g(x, y) requires the inequality   ().

so far we have derived a general constraint (4.9) on the physical spectrum of conformal
elds living in m. while this inequality is always presented for conformal elds having the
intrinsic description (4.4), it may not really provide a useful constraint in the ads/cft
correspondence. as a matter fact, if a scalar conformal eld arises from the adsd+1/cf td
correspondence, then its conformal dimension should obey another inequality [3]

 

d
2

.

(4.12)

thus, if ()  d
2, the constraint (4.9) is weaker than (4.12) and it will be automatically
satised in the boundary cft. in this case our constraint has no observable eect on the
underlying physical spectrum. in order for (4.9) to have visible eect, we have to consider
another case, () > d
2, where taking the quotient by  will change the boundary theory
drastically. note that the case () > d
2 is also interesting from the mathematical point of
view [21].

the above results can be rederived in the bulk theory via the quotient ads/cft corre-
spondence. consider a scalar eld (y) with mass m in the bulk spacetime x = hd+1/.
the classical action is given by

i() =

the klein-gordon equation for  has the form

2 =

there is a real number

(4.15)

separating the l2-spectrum of 2 (which is contained in the region  <   0(x)) from

 this number takes the value [22]

(4.16)

now, given any boundary values 0(x) for x  m and a positive function f (y) on x  xm
which has a rst-order zero on the boundary, one wants to extend 0(x) uniquely to a -
harmonic function  in the interior of x, such that (y)  f (dd2+4)/2  0 as y  x ap-
proches a boundary point. stability requires that we should only consider positive -harmonic
extensions, namely solutions of (4.14) with   m2  0(x), and all the l2-solutions with
 strictly less than 0(x) should be discarded (since they are precisely the normalizable
zero modes that will lead to instabilities). according to the ads/cft correspondence, the
conformal operator o(x) coupled naturally to the source 0(x) on the quotient boundary has
the scaling dimension

2 , in

to determine the dependence of () on , let us recall a geometrical characteristic of
the critical exponent [21]. suppose rst that  is a convex cocompact group, namely,  has
a fundamental domain in hd+1 which has nitely many sides and does not touch the limit
set . sometimes such groups are also called geometrically nite without cusps and they
form quite a rich class in hyperbolic geometry. if  is convex cocompact, then it can be shown
([21], section 3) that the critical exponent of  agrees exactly with the hausdor dimension
of the limit set:

() = dh().

(4.18)

15

next, for a more general non-elementary discrete group , its critical exponent turns out
to be greater than or equal to the hausdor dimension of the radial limit set rad
 . recall that
if and only if there are innitely many y1, y2, . . .  hd+1 in
[21] a point x of sd belongs to rad
some orbit  y, such that the distance between yn and a geodesic ray ending at x is bounded
for all n. using this denition one easily checks that rad
  . it is conjectured that not
only the inequality ()  dh(rad

 ) holds, but actually one has the equality



() = dh(rad

 ),

(4.19)

and this conjecture was veried when  has a ()-nite volume ([21], section 6), including all
(nitely generated) fuchian groups. note that (4.19) implies (4.18) in the convex cocompact
case since in that case we have rad

 = .

from the foregoing discussion we expect that () may increase as  becomes larger and
larger. in particular when rad
 =  lls the whole boundary sphere sd, or the hausdor
dimension dh(rad
 ) reaches its maximal value d, then according to the constraint (4.9), there
will be no relevant operators in the boundary theory. as we have seen in the previous section,
this can occur if  becomes so large that the volume of x is nite; in such an extreme case we
have m2  0(x) = 0 for all scalar elds in the bulk and thus no tachyon modes can exist.
it would be very interesting to understand the underlying bulk/boundary correspondence in
terms of brane dynamics (cf. [23]).

5 computing the scalar 2-point function

in this section we shall compute the scalar two-point function explicitly using the quotient
ads/cft correspondence. the computation is a -invariant version of that presented in [3].
for simplicity, we shall assume that  has no cusps, or at least the cusps do not meet the
limit set , so that the kleinian boundary of x = hd+1/ is simply given by m = d/.
following [3], let us solve the klein-gordon equation (4.14) dened in x with the given
boundary values 0(x), x  m. for this purpose we need to construct a (generalized) poisson
kernel k(y, x) on x  m such that (2
(y) = zm 

y  m2)k(y, x) = 0 for all y in x and

ddx k(y, x)  0(x)

(5.1)

has the correct boundary behavior. on the covering space hd+1 d of x  m, the poisson

16

kernel k(y, x) is known to be [3]

k(y, x) = const. 

y
0

(y2
0 + |y  x|2)

(5.2)

where  is dened in (4.17). however, this expression does not meet our requirement of -
invariance. in fact, given any   , we have (y, x) = (y, x) and cosh (y, x) = 1 + |yx|2
,
so that

2y0x0

k(y, x) = ( lim
x00

x0

(x)0

)  k(y, x) = |(x)|  k(y, x).

(5.3)

thus in general we do not have k(y, x) = k(y, x). to nd the -invariant poisson kernel,
we will invoke the familiar poincare series

k(y, x)  x |(x)|  k(y, x),

y  hd+1, x  d.

(5.4)

it is easy to check that (i) k(y, x) has the desired -invariant propertiy k(y, x) = k(y, x)
for any   , (ii) k(y, x) transforms covariantly under x  x, namely k(y, x) =
|(x)|  k(y, x), and (iii) k(y, x) solves the klein-gordon equation in hd+1. thus, com-
bining (i) and (iii) we see that (5.4) is in fact a solution of the klein-gordon equation in x.
before we can identify such k(y, x) with the poisson kernel dened on x  m, we need to
check further that substituting (5.4) into (5.1) will lead to the correct boundary behavior of
(y).

to this end we take a -invariant conformal density (in the sense of [21]) of dimension ,

dened on the covering space d of the quotient boundary:

d(x)  0(x) ddx,

d(x) = |(x)|  d(x).

(5.5)

one requires that the function 0(x) in (5.5) should transform as 0(x) = |(x)|d 0(x)
under    : d  d, namely, it should look like a eld of conformal dimension d  .
in particular we can take 0(x) to be the lifting of the boundary values 0(x) from m to its
covering space d, which has the correct conformal dimension. with this choice we pick an
arbitrary fundamental domain f  d of  and then consider
z

k(y, x)|(x)| d(x)

zd

ddx k(y, x) 0(x) = x
= z

z(f )
k(y, x) d(x) = x
ddx k(y, x) 0(x) = zm 

(5.6)

f

ddx k(y, x) 0(x).

notice that the rst integral in (5.6) has the correct boundary behavior, since k(y, x) is the
poisson kernel on the covering space. the last integral thus gives the desired solution of the
klein-gordon equation in x with the boundary values 0(x).

we are now ready to evaluate the action (4.13). let us choose a fundamental domain g
of  in hd+1 such that g  sd = g  d = f . this is possible since we have assumed that
all possible cusps of  do not live in the limit set . we can represent the integral in (4.13)
over x by a corresponding integral over g and, by integrating by parts, one nds that the
action i() consists of two terms, one of which vanishes due to the equation of motion and
the other of which can be reduced to a surface integral [3]

where t is the horosphere y0 =  based at , hij = ij/2 is the metric induced from g,

with 0(x) being the lifting of 0(x).

since our computation manifests -invariance, the above expression is actually an integral
over m  m. this may be seen directly from (5.8). for this purpose, we take two mobius
transformations x  1x, y  2y. using (5.5) as well as the distortion formula

|1x  2y|2 = |1(x)|  |(1
|(2y)|
|x  1

1 2y|2

1 2)(y)|  |2(y)|

(5.9)

(which may be veried directly from the denition), we nd that the integral (5.8) is invariant
if we replace its integration domain f  f by 1(f )  2(f ) and, at the same time, replace
 by   11
2 . thus, if 1, 2  , then  coincides exactly with  and 1,2(f ) consti-
tute fundamental domains. consequently, (5.8) is independent of the choice of fundamental
domains in both factors of f  f , hence giving rise to an integral of the form

ddxddy 0(x) g(x, y) 0(y).

(5.10)

i() = zm m 

according to the quotient version of the ads/cft correspondence, the function g(x, y)
in the bulk action (5.10) is to be identied with the two-point correlator < o(x)o(y) > of

18

the boundary theory, where o(x) is a scalar eld on m of conformal dimension . we thus
expect that g(x, y) should be consistent with conformal invaiance of the boundary theory;
in particular, it should transform correctly under the unbroken conformal group (2.4) on m,
namely for any f  so(d + 1, 1) such that f1f = , we should have g(f (x), f (y)) =
|f(x)||f(y)|g(x, y). as a quick check, taking 1 = 2 = f in (5.9) to derive

x

|(f (y))|
|f (x)  f (y)|2 = |f(x)||f(y)| xf 1f

|(y)|
|x  y|2 .

(5.11)

hence g(x, y) indeed has the desired transformation properties under (2.4).

the above computation has several straightforward extensions. first we can consider
twisted sectors by incorporating a factor () in each term of the poincare series (5.4),
where  is some one-dimensional unitary representation of the discrete group . secondly,
the computation can be extended directly to correlation functions involving other local elds
in the boundary theory, such as elds with lorentz and internal indices. the general form of
two-point functions should look like a poincare series which arises from taking the -invariant
projection. it is also possible to compute higher-point functions by investigating nontrivial
interactions in the supergravity action.

6 conclusions

in this paper we have made several obsevations supporting a quotient version of the ads/cft
correspondence. one observation is that given bulk spacetime of the form x = hd+1/, the
quantized conformal eld theory associated to tree-level supergravity in x should live on
the kleinian boundary m = (d/)  {cusps not in d} of x, rather than on the naive
quotient space m = sd/. this is consistent both with the holographic principle and with a
geometrical consideration. in particular, we explained how this kleinian boundary manifold
can be completely discretized when the domain of discontinuity d collapses or, equivalently,
the limit set  lls the whole boundary sphere sd of the hyperbolic space, with its hausdor
dimension dh() reaching the maximal value d. in this extreme case we found an interesting
physical interpretation of a mathematical relation between the volume of cusped hyperbolic
manifolds and the number of cusps on them, in terms of the space-time uncertainty principle.
in order for conformal elds on m to have an intrinsic description (required for formu-
lating the ads/cft correspondence), we argued that the spectrum of conformal dimensions
should be bounded from below by a critical exponent (), which is roughly the same as

19

the hausdor dimension dh() of the limit set. we have given two arguments, one which
was based on the boundary theory and the other rested on bulk supergravity, both led to
the same bound. this bound will have visible eect provided it exceeds another bound, d/2,
established in spaces without taking the quotient. the critical exponent () gives a natural
measure of the size of , so when  becomes suciently large the scaling dimension of the
most relevant operators will increase. in the extreme case () = d we could have a boundary
theory without relevant operators.

we also computed the scalar two-point function by reducing the action of massive scalars
in x to a bilinear term on the quotient boundary m. the result turned out to be consistent
with conformal invariance of the boundary theory. in this computation, we have restricted
ourselves to the simplest case m = d/ and ignored the possibility that cusps of  can
live outside the domain of discontinuity. if there are cusps touching the limit set, then our
computation would be complicated by possible contributions from the cusp forms.
in
general, these contributions are expected to be not negligible since the hand-wave argument
presented at the end of section 3 suggests that a neighbourhood of a cusp, even it is very
small, could contain nontrivial physical information. in a sense, cusps look like black holes,
both of which render the manifold incomplete. it would be interesting to know more about
the role of cusps in the ads/cft correspondence.
