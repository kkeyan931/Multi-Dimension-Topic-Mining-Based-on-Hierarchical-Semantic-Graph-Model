generalized lower dimensions. proved 9+1d {$9610043$} using supersymmetry (see also {$9610043$}). 2 twisted eld-theory partition functions principle, one recover spectrum s-matrix eld-theory partition

asymptotically r0 one read-o energy spectrum qcd t3 (in given sector uxes). limit, ri , one able recognize spectrum free fock space glueballs. splitting energy levels order r1 corrections energy of, say, 2-particle state proportional 5 v 1 v r1r2r3. ri v 1 corrections much smaller therefore s-matrix also read-o corrections hence z. theories interested require slight modication. let us take example u(n) sym n = 4 supersymmetry. partition function t4 good object because: compactication t3, moduli-space r6n /sn 3+1d theory would give rise 6n non-compact integration variables. even worked n

ith s1 elds rotated gi su(4). requirement gis mutually commuting. hence, taken inside cartan torus gi r3/(a3), (a3) root lattice su(4). top that, mod weyl group w = s4 su(4). let us also take generic t4 parameterized point in, thus, parameter space zn is, sl(4, z)\gl(4, r)/so(4). fmsu sl(4, z)\((t 4/s4) gl(4, r))/so(4). h sl(4, z) acts g gl(4, r) g h g 4 acts fundamental representation 4, treated

partition function could innite. however, particular space behaves special way innity. let us take euclidean version , let x coordinate t7 (instead t6,1) let coordinate r4-ber. let us also assume none

however, act element u-duality group e7(z), geometrical twist necessarily transform geometrical twist. thus, like -twists little-string theory (see {$9711200$}), parameter-space twists actually

u(1) u(1) spin(4) twist every one 56 charges. assume (without proof) twists commuting z2 z2 weyl group acts simultaneously them. thus, parameter space is, fm = e7(z)\(cid:16)(cid:16)(u(1) u(1))56/(z2 z2)(cid:17) (e7(r)/su(8))(cid:17) . here, e7(z) acts factors simultaneously. (2) addition 7 geometrical twists 21 twists corresponding fractional m2-brane charges, 21 twists corresponding fractional m5-brane charges 7 twists corre- sponding fractional kk-monopole charges. extra non-geometrical twists dened u-duals geometrical twists. example twist corresponds fractional m2-brane charge directions 1, 2 dened limit m-theory t3 t4 t4 large t3 small geometrical twist 3rd direction. interesting question might whether twists another low-energy description without using u-duality. twisting kk-monopole charge seems particularly interesting case because, large radii, might possible describe unconventional ge- ometry. large radii, kk-monopole described smooth geometrical solution. 9 kk-monopole charge respect the, say, 7th direction t7 corresponds rst chern class circle bundle s1 (in 7th direction) makes s2 surrounds kk-monopole innity. fractional kk-monopole charge means rst chern class fractional comes state non-trivial representation transverse spin(4). interesting note fractional chern classes naturally arise context noncommutative geometry  might something kind twist. 3.3 instanton expansion argue 7, dened above, encodes partition functions zn twisted little-string theories (and hence also ordinary non-supersymmetric yang-mills theories). see this, let us take t7 form t6 s1 let us, preliminary step, shrink s1 zero size, keeping t6 nite string units {$9705221$}. let us also set twist along s1 zero. obtain weakly coupled type-iia t6 transverse-spin(4) twists. however, 7 also depends 6-form (dual nsns 2-form) ux along t6. ux periodic variable (2) (at least keep spin(4)-twists geometrical take so(6, 6, z) t-dual -twists). let us call . fourier transform log(7) respect ? imagine instanton made n ns5-branes wrapped t6. assume twists irrational, ns5-branes pinned origin transverse r4.

(of course, one recover zn well.) 3.4 possible singularities 7 discussion might given misleading impression 7 smooth func- tion. argue, contrary, 7 fact exhibits pathological behavior. let us rst discuss possible singularities 7. central assumption action m-theory concentrated region nite volume. assumption fails following case. suppose twists gi preserve vector representation 4 spin(4). means direction transverse space, r4, participate twisting. thus, translational invariance along direction preserved partition function multiplied innite length direction. another situation potentially dangerous too. suppose twists gi rational nonzero. integer n gn = = 0 . . . 6. let h subgroup spin(4) generated gis let = ord h, number elements h. problem arises instanton made branes wrapping cycle t7 separate branes occupy orbit h r4. separation mode noncompact potential danger contribution particular instanton diverge. however, seems problem actually averted follows. branes separated large distance transverse r4 neglect modes coming strings membranes connecting dierent branes. branes actually form one large connected brane covering space. case, brane far away transverse r4 described, good approximation, theory 16 supersymmetries twist xed point position 11 brane anymore. thus, contribution instanton separated congurations likely converge. intriguing note resemblance situation occurs frequently non- commutative geometry. take non-commutative gauge theory t2 example. rational non-commutativity parameters mapped commutative gauge theory smaller t2 larger gauge group magnetic ux (see ). hand, rational points always described limits irrational points. (see also {$9802109$}.) finally, case seems certain lead singularity 7. one twists element (1) spin(4). case, twist fermion number ()f . euclidean space-time, twist associated nite temperature. even twists irrational, partition function likely 2k i, j, k z. diverge. problem occurs whenever twist form e 2j+1 recent discussion behavior string theories nite temperature see {$9802150$}. might seem erratic behavior 7, ill-dened. argue contrary, let us give example. take, f (q, z = rei) xn =1 zn 1 qn , |z| < 1. (3) k (and integer k, l). points dense function pole q, q = e circle |q| = 1. other-hand, q = ei irrational number, function well dened. example, = 2, one easily show k, l z+, l 2 | l k| > 1 22k2 , therefore (3) converges |z| < 1. similar argument holds algebraic (i.e. root polynomial integer coecients) irrational . furthermore, fourier decompose f (q, z) xed |z| respect = argz, xed n get function 1/(1 qn ) smooth except n singularities. also, extend denition f (q, z) |q| < 1 get well-behaved function. moral story?

particular, trade twists moduli td? let us start case = 8. transverse space r3 twists spin(3) = su(2). however, case face one problems discussed previous subsection problem arises whenever (11 d) odd. commuting elements spin(3) always common eigenvector representation 3. means always direction transverse r3 preserved twists hence translational invariance along direction preserved. partition function therefor innite factor coming direction. reasonable thing therefore compactify direction well. end m-theory t9 spin(2) = u(1) twists transverse r2. m-theory t9 two-dimensional theory behaves drastically dierent higher dimensional toroidal compactications. one, lengths sides t9, well uxes along it, longer moduli uctuating elds. usual questions ask 2+1d higher, i.e. s-matrix massless massive particles, longer make sense. one, probably massive stable particles 3+1d moreover, 1+1d theory conformally invariant. wish imply interesting questions 1+1d probably work harder nd them. going back setting, recall usual argument moduli small uctuations 1+1d correlation functions behave like log r fall distance. however, setting really two-dimensional! seen above, generic irrational twists, points far innity surrounded arbitrarily large 11-dimensional ball. thus, plausible lengths, angles 13 uxes t9 stable. determined boundary conditions innity. let us therefore assume partition function, 9, exists. one show partition function 7 m-theory t7 spin(4) twists encoded 9. decompactify two sides t9 get t7 rst sight seems twists restricted spin(2) spin(4) subgroup. turn parts twists?
