abstract

we study the evolution, the transverse spreading and the subsequent ther-
malization of string states in the weyl static axisymmetric spacetime. this
possesses a singular event horizon on the symmetry axis and a naked singular-
ity along the other directions. the branching diusion process of string bits
approaching the singular black-hole horizon provides the notion of the tem-
perature that is calculated for this process. we nd that the solution of the
fokker-planck equation in the phase space of the transverse variables of the
string, can be factored as a product of two thermal distributions, provided that
the classical conjugate variables satisfy the uncertainty principle. we comment
on the possible physical signicance of this result.

i. introduction

string theory is the most promising candidate for a consistent quantization of gravity
and a subsequent unied description of all the fundamental interactions [1-2]. one of
the rst steps towards a deep understanding of the quantum gravitational phenomena
is to study the string evolution and quantization in the presence of a gravitational
eld [2-3]. this became necessary by the fact that in the spectrum of bosonic string
theory gravity appears naturally through the massless spin-2 state having long range
couplings that mimic general relativity.

in the context of black hole physics, strings have been identied with black hole
states [4] and also have been used for the resolution of the so called information loss

problem. namely of the apparent inconsistency of the black hole evaporation through
the thermal hawking radiation and the unitary evolution of the quantum states of
the infalling matter that produces the gravitational collapse. the notion of stretched
horizon has been introduced for the distant observer, and it is supposed to absorb
and thermalize the quantum states of infalling matter which is in the form of strings
[5-7].

following these arguments, the transverse spreading of a relativistic string which
falls towards the black hole horizon has been described as a branching diusion pro-
cess [8]. this stohastic process provides the necessary mechanism for thermalization
of the quantum state of the string. the resulting temperature calculated agrees in the
order of magnitude, with the semiclassical result of hawking and bekenstein. also,
other ecient methods have been proposed that use explicit equations of state for the
matter in the form of strings, the so called planckian solid, which prevent the loss of
information inside the black hole during the gravitational collapse [9].

all the above eorts have been concentrated on the problem where the singularity
is hidden from the asymptotic observer via the horizon. it would be interesting to
discuss the problem of whether thermalization of string states can occur in a more
general context where there exists a singular event horizon or a naked singularity in
the spacetime manifold. in principle one can get arbitrary close to the singularity
in this case. however, if one takes into account the fact that strings are quantum
objects, then one can show that there exists thermalization of string states, occuring
at nite distance from the singularity. the purpose of this paper is to examine this
possibility.

the weyl static axisymmetric spacetime is the model under consideration that
provides the setting and it is a class of static exact solutions of the einsteins eld
equations [10]. the problem of a line source of length 2 and of mass density /2 is
known to be described by the  metric, which can be written either in spherical
or prolate spheroidal coordinate systems. this family of solutions encompasses the
schwarzschild solution for  = 1 and except for that solution, the family possesses
singular event horizons [11]. these are in fact directional singularities for   2 ,
and by a proper choice of the coordinate system reveal their nature as extended
hypersurfaces [12]. for all the other values of  one in fact has a singularity for all
directions 0     [12]. from this the a metric which is an exact solitonic
solution in vacuum is obtained through a limiting procedure [13]. this can also be
interpreted as the metric for a counter-rotating disc in general relativity [14,15].

this paper is organized as follows:

in section ii, the general features of static axisymmetric solutions to the einsteins
eld equations are reviewed.
in section iii, we develop the formalism and calculate the diusion coecients for the
thermalization process of the string states, in the case where 0 <  < 1 , which is
the range of parameters under consideration.
in section iv, the fokker-planck equation is solved in the phase space of the trans-
verse variables of the string, that is falling towards the black-hole.

2

in section v, numerical estimates that connect the above work with real astrophysical
systems, is provided.
in section vi, we give a discussion of the contribution of the quantum aspects of
strings, when they are taken into account, for the process of thermalization.

and it tends to zero when  > 1 , while it tends to innity as 0 <  < 1 .
therefore, intuitively one expects that in the former class of models it is dicult to
have thermalization process while in the second it can occur naturally. this is because
in the rst case the strong tidal gravitational forces tend to shrink the string, so it is
impossible for the string bits to become uncorrelated (via thermalization process) as
the relativistic string approaches the singular event horizon.

now we introduce kruskal-type coordinates,

the light-cone gauge corresponds to the setting  = u/4m , that is to the choice

 = sa/2m . it is easy to verify, using eqs (15), (18), (19), (21) and (24)-(25) that
ds2 = dudv in comformity with [8] and as it should be for kruskal coordinates.
in eq (22), the range of the parameters is /2 < s < /2 and also 0 < u < u0 ,
where u0  4mc021/(1  ) , (appendix ii).
from eq (18), for this range of s , the function u(s) as strictly increasing and
continuous is invertible. the variable u corresponds to the cosmic-time t and we
are interested in the asymptotic regime u  u0 where we shall seek steady state
correlation functionals and stationary probability density functionals.
we consider a relativistic string that falls freely, along the symmetry axis  = 0 ,

towards the singular horizon. the wave equation in the free-fall frame is given by

2! x i(, ) = 0.

(26)

for the transverse coordinates x i(, ) . in our case these are the spacelike transverse
coordinates in the vicinity of the hypersurface  = 0 , because as it was proven in [12]
with a proper choice of coordinates this is a two dimensional hypersurface for   2
while for our case of 0 <  < 1 it is a pure singularity. therefore we consider a string
which falls towards the singularity, with its transverse coordinates being normal to
the symmetry axis  = 0.
this can be written as

2 xi(u, ) + i.

(38)

the form of the functions h1(u), h2(u) is given by direct comparison with eq (37).
the spatial derivative term becomes negligible with respect to the rst term on the
r.h.s. of eq (38), as u  u0 , that is, when the string approaches the singularity
at r = 2m . an additional supporting argument for this is given in appendix iii.

this correlation function shows that the string bits undergo brownian motion since
the correlation of two string bits is practically zero outside the correlation length

now these correlator functions are negligible in comparison to eq (39) as the string
approaches the singularity, that is as u  u0 . this is evident from eq (83).

iv. the diusion process and the fokker-planck
equation

for the case of schwarzschild spacetime ( = 1) we obtain the same results as in [8],
because the term ( du
d )1 in eq (39) reduces to (1/4m) . for the present case the
coecient of the correlator is the diusion coecient for the process. it is given by

 2

1    

8m! 2+1

 !(cid:18) u

u0(cid:19)/1 "1 (cid:18) u

u0(cid:19)2/1#/2

.

(43)

by the uctuation-dissipation theorem the temperature of the process assigned by
an asymptotic observer is inversely proportional to the diusion coecient [18]. as
u  u0 the temperature grows without limit.

7

from eqs (41)-(42) one concludes that the diusion process in momentum space
is negligible and can be omitted with respect to the diusion process in ordinary
space. we will however retain this also and consider that it evolves with a diusion
coecient 2  1 . we rewrite the two langevin equations as

xi(u, )

u

vi(u, )

u

= vi + i

= h1(u)vi + i.

(44)

(45)

the fokker-planck equation for the probability density  = (xi, vi; u) , correspond-
ing to the above set of equations is given by [19]


u

(46)

the probability density can be normalized for all times if it is normalized once.
this is because we have

u

(xi, vi; u) =

= z dxidvif (xi, vi; u) = 0,

(47)

which vanishes under proper boundary conditions, because the action of the operator
f can be written as a divergence with respect to the space variables. we denote
collectively the space variables (xi) by (q) and (vi) by (v).
writing f = f1 + h1(u)f2 where it is evident the content of the two terms, we can
write formally the solution of the fokker-planck equation as

(q, v; u) = exp[uf1 + g(u)f2](q)(v),

(48)

(49)

with

here, the usual convention, (q) = 1

were able to solve completely the time-dependent fokker-planck eq (46) without any

cannot be solved in closed form for a generic choice of the function h1(u) .
in
appendix iii, the asymptotic form of h1(u) is given as u  u0. for this choice
the solution is given by

(56)
(57)

(58)

with the only approximation made up to here, is that as u  u0, q2(u)  0 so
that the second term on the r.h.s. of eq (52) can be neglected, as being of the second
order, in the rst order approximation case. neglecting, for the same argument, the
third term in the r.h.s. of eq (55), one can integrate it, obtaining

(u) = ln

u 

20

(1 + )

(u0  u)(1+)/2.

(59)

from eq (50), we now see, that we can have a product of two thermal distributions,
provided that the cross term in the exponential is constant, or can be neglected.
denoting this term as

t (u) 

20

(1 + )

(u0  u)(1+)/2

2 2

1 u

qv

(60)

and following the same procedure as in appendix iii, we nd that the asymptotic
form of eq (43), as u  u0 is given by  2
1  (u0  u)/2 . therefore in eq
(60) the overall dependence is given by t (u)  (u0  u)1/2 . now we assume
that the uncertainity principle relation holds for the phase space variables
qv =
h, h =constant. then from eq (60) the cross term vanishes and we have a product
of two thermal distribution functions.

v. numerical estimates

there exist a variety of physically interesting systems that one could refer to, in
order to ascertain that the range of parameters under study, is acceptable. using

9

c = g = k = 1 with c = 2.99  1010 cm/sec=1 and
geometical units we set
g/c2 = 0.74  1028 cm/gr=1 for the conversion factors [20].
for cosmic strings, one can consider two extreme cases. a string that originates
in symmetry breaking at a mass scale   1016 gev (the scale of guts) has a mass
per unit length of the order 1022 gr/cm [21]. on the other side strings arising in the
electroweak scale   1 tev has a mass per unit length of the order 106 gr/cm.
such a string with the length of a galaxy (radius 1022cm) would have a mass of the
order of 1016 gr and it would be unobservable by gravitational interactions. for the
rst case we obtain  = 0.74106  1 while for the second  = 0.741034  1 .
m = 1.989  1033gr= 1.477  105cm. in order that we get a value of

a more realistic prospect comes from the fact that the mass of the sun is

 =

1m
2

=

1
2

,

(61)

we must have  = 1.447  105cm, which compared with the sun radius r 
7  1010cm gives a ratio of the order of 105 .
on the galactic scale, the most extreme case corresponds to the masses of central
regions [22-23]. here we have mbh  109m = 1.477  1014cm, whereas the central
region extends over the scale of r  0.1pc= 3.086  1017cm. this yields  
0.3 103. therefore in all cases, the range of parameters under study is the relevant
one, for almost all astrophysically interesting systems.

vi. discussion

the concept of the stretched horizon has been introduced recently, that thermalizes
the quantum states of the infalling matter towards the black hole and eventually
reemits them in the form of the thermal hawking radiaton. this prevents the loss
of information inside the black hole horizon during the gravitational collapse so that
there exists at this rst level of analysis no conict between the notion of gravitational
collapse and the unitary evolution of states in quantum theory. this is achieved by
considering that matter is in the form of strings, that undergo a diusion process in
the space of the transverse variables.
in our case the spacetime under consideration contains a singular event horizon for
 = 0 and   2 , while for other values of 0 <  < 1, a naked singularity along
all the directions. therefore there doesnt exist a horizon and no natural distinction
between an asymptotic and a free-falling observer. even more we have chosen to
describe the process of branching diusion in terms of the coordinate-based observer
that in principle, can approach arbitrary close to the singularity. if however we invoke
the fact that strings are quantum objects, this provides the mechanism for obtaining
thermal spectrum for the diusion processes of string bits in both the conguration
and the momentum space of the transverse variables of the string. therefore we
can associate with it a temperature. this has been achieved for the particular class

10

of static models that have 0 <  < 1 . although we considered the case of the
symmetry axis where there exists the singularity, by conntinuity our arguments are
valid in the vicinity of  = 0 . therefore in the case of the naked singularity we also
have thermalization process.

now, although it seems that this temperature increases without limit, there exists
a very interesting fact here. it has to do with the fact that practically the string is
somehow thermalized at some nite distance away from the singularity, in whatever
quantum state it had been initially. the string bits become practically uncorrelated
over a spatial distance of the same order of magnitude as the quantum correlation
length. in principle then, very little or no information, can get lost on the singular
event horizon, or can escape from it.

one can reverse this argument and examine whether this is some form of cosmic
censorship. this is enhanced by the fact that this is a static spacetime and there
t  (t) . also in the same
exists the invariance under coordinate-time reversal
spirit, it would be interesting, if one could address the same problem for membranes or
other extended objects of modern string theory. work along these lines is is progress
and will be reported promptly.

appendix ii

we consider eq (18) and the case 0 <  < 1 . setting u(s) = 4mcos1(s)f (s)
one nds that f(s) satises



cos(s)f

(s) + (  1)sin(s)f (s) + 1 = 0.

setting h = sin(s) and subsequently h = (2t  1)

(0 < t < 1) one nally gets

2t(1  t)

df
dt

+ (1  )(1  2t)f (t) + 1 = 0.

it can be shown that the following is a solution to this equation [17],

f (t) = 

1

1   2f1(1  , 1;

3  
2

; t),

by expanding in a power series f(t) and substituting into eq (75). using
mathematica, eq (18) is integrated as

(74)

(75)

(76)

(77)

u(s) =

4m
1  

cos1(s)

qsin2(s)

2f1(cid:18)1  

2

,

1
2

;

3  
2

; cos2(s)(cid:19) sin(s)

these are exactly equivalent due to a property of hypergeometric functions (see [17],
p.561, 15.3.30). in the same way one integrates eq (19).
we use now two well known properties of the hypergeometric function to obtain the
limit t  1 .

2f1(a, b; c; t) = (1  t)cab
2f1(a, b; c; 1) =

(c)(c  a  b)
(c  a)(c  b)

2f1(c  a, c  b; c; t)

(c  a  b > 0, b > 0).

(78)

so we obtain

2f1(1  , 1;

3  
2

1 + 

2

; t) = (1  t)(1)/2

2f1(
= (1  t)(1)/2 ( 3
 c0(1  t)(1)/2.

,
2 )( 1
2 )
(1  )

for t=1, which corresponds to s = /2 , we obtain that

u0  u(s = /2) =

21.

4mc0

therefore in the vicinity of t  1 , we have

u(s) =

c0(4t)(1)/2,

so we can invert eq (22) to obtain

sin(s) = "2(cid:18) u

from appendix ii we obtain

h2(u)
h1(u)

= 0

(82)

and the spatial derivative term is negligible. alternatively, the vector i  xi/
is the separation vector of two points on the string, obeying the geodesic deviation
equation

d2i
d 2 + ri

jklujkul = 0.

(85)

for i =  , we have from appendix i, that the second term on the l.h.s. of eq (66)
vanishes. then it is solved as (, ) = 0() + 1() . so the spatial derivative
term is proportional to the proper time ( ) which remains nite on the singular
horizon.
we proceed now to obtain the asymptotic form of h1(u) , as u  u0 . combining
eqs (37), (38) and (83) we have

h1(u) = (cid:18) 

u0(cid:19)2/(1)#(1)/2

.

2(cid:19)"1 (cid:18) u
2m(cid:19)(cid:18) 1
0 <   (cid:18)u0  u

u0 (cid:19)  1,

denoting,

we have that

"1 (cid:18) u

u0(cid:19)2/(1)#(1)/2

= h1  (1  )2/(1)i(1)/2

 (cid:18)1

,

so that

h1(u) =
