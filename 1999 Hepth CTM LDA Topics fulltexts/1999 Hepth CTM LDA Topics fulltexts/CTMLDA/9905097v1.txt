we list the spectrum generating algebras for string theory and m-theory com-
pactied on various backgrounds of the form adsd+1  sn. we identify the rep-
resentations of these algebras which make up the classical supergravity spectra
and argue for the presence of these spectrum generating algebras in the classical
string/m-theory. we also discuss the role of the spectrum generating algebras on
the conformal eld theory side.

1. introduction

there exists convincing evidence [1,2] for a duality between string theory or m-theory
on adsd+1  sn with n units of n-form ux through sn and a d-dimensional su (n )
superconformal eld theory on the boundary of adsd+1. this conjecture exists both in
a weak form and in a strong form. in the weak form the space adsd+1  sn, with size
proportional to n , is taken to be quite large. in this limit supergravity dominates and
captures all the physics of the dual large n superconformal eld theory. in the strong
form of the conjecture, string theory or m-theory eects need to be taken into account
to properly describe the nite n superconformal eld theory. available evidence for the
ads/cft conjecture focuses mainly on the weak form [1,2], although some progress has
been made towards understanding the full stringy spectrum [3].

in order to understand string theory (m-theory is more problematic) on adsd+1 sn,
the classical string action needs to be quantized in this background. this procedure should
produce the discrete spectrum of string states and their masses along with rules for calcu-
lating their interactions. in this paper, we use an alternative approach to provide informa-
tion on the string spectrum. we consider the eleven, ten and six-dimensional supergravity
limits of m/string theory, as well as massive ten-dimensional stringy elds expanded in
kaluza-klein (kk) modes on sn. even though identifying the proper independent string
degrees of freedom using this method is extremely dicult, we argue that one impor-
tant qualitative feature of the kaluza-klein reduction survives, namely the presence of a
so-called spectrum generating algebra [4,5,6].

a spectrum generating algebra (sga) typically does not commute with the hamil-
tonian and is non-linearly realized at the level of the action, but it describes the entire
spectrum of a particular physical system [4]. sgas have been very successfully used in
nuclear, atomic and molecular physics, not only in the study of spectra but also in the
computation of various transition amplitudes (for more details on this subject, consult [4]).
in kaluza-klein reductions sgas usually appear because the towers of harmonics
used in these reductions can be t into unitary irreducible representations (uir) of the
conformal groups of the corresponding compactied spaces (spheres, products of spheres,
or any einstein spaces which have a natural action of the conformal group) [5], [6], [7].
since the eigenvalues of harmonics are related to the masses of the corresponding kaluza-
klein states, the algebra of the conformal group does not commute with the hamiltonian.
for the case of compactications on sn the corresponding conformal group so(n + 1, 1)
acts as a spectrum generating algebra [5,6].

the conformal generators of the sga are not isometries of the compactication man-
ifold. rather, the operation of rescaling of the manifold corresponds to the scanning of
the spectrum of the associated operator (dirac, laplace, etc.) on the manifold in question.
in particular the spherical harmonics on sn provide a natural uir of the conformal group

1

of sn 1, which generates the spectrum of kk modes, see section 2. we will explicitly
demonstrate this construction for supergravity elds. to do this, we extend the results
known in the supergravity literature [6] by demonstrating how the corresponding spectra
t into uirs of the relevant conformal group for some of the maximally symmetric ex-
amples of the ads/cft correspondence: iib string theory on ads5  s5 [9], m-theory
on ads4  s7 [10] and ads7  s4 [11], and iia or iib string theory on ads3  s3  x 4
[12](see section 3 and tables 1.-4.). our results can be also extended to the case of iia or
iib string theory on ads2  s2  x 6 [13].2

in view of the ads/cft correspondence we consider the map between the action of
an sga on the supergravity spectrum and the corresponding action of what we call an
operator generating algebra (oga) on the chiral primaries on the cft side. demonstrating
the presence of sgas in the supergravity spectrum allows us to argue for and better
understand the extension of the sgas to the full string/m-theory. more explicitly, we
discuss the kk towers of the level one massive string states of the at ten-dimensional
(iia or iib) string on s5, and show how they provide uirs of the corresponding sga.
we expect that the action of the oga generalizes to include operators in the cft dual
to stringy elds. in particular we discuss how the relevant oga could act on the so-called
konishi supermultiplet [14,15] which is expected to correspond to massive string states
of iib string theory on s5, see section 4. finally, in section 5, we discuss the relevance
of sga in the case of the recent proposal on the nite n case and quantum deformed
isometries [16].

2. review of representation theory of so(n + 1, 1)

let us consider a generic supergravity theory compactied on adsm  sn. all su-
pergravity elds can be expanded into harmonic functions on sn (this is just the physical
statement of the peter-weyl theorem [8]). it can be shown that these harmonic functions
provide a uir of the conformal group on sn, which is so(n + 1, 1). this can be seen as

follows [8,6]: let sn denote a unit sphere p xixi = 1 and let g  so(n + 1, 1)

g = (cid:18) ai

j
cj

bi

d (cid:19)

the action of g  so(n + 1, 1) on sn is given by

(gx)i = (ai

jxj + bi)(ckxk + d)1

1 this follows from an extension of the peter-weyl theorem, [8], vol.2, chapter 9.
2 we can as well consider heterotic/m-theory/f-theory compactications on calabi-yau man-

ifolds to six and four dimensions as our starting point.

2

(2.1)

(2.2)

and the action of g1  so(n + 1, 1) on complex functions f : sn  c by

((g1)f )(xi) = (ckxk + d)f ((gx)i)

(2.3)

where   c is called the weight. furthermore, let l2(sn) be the hilbert space of square
integrable complex functions over sn with the natural inner product

(f1, f2)  zsn

f1(x)f2(x)gdnx

(2.4)

where gdnx is the so(n + 1, 1) invariant measure on sn. then it is easy to show that
this inner product is preserved under the action of g1  so(n + 1, 1) on f1, f2 dened
above, provided that the weight  = n/2 + i, where  is an arbitrary real number. thus
the space of harmonic functions over sn provides a unitary irreducible representation of
so(n + 1, 1) [8].

since kk modes of supergravity elds on sn are expected to t into uirs of the
so(n + 1, 1) sga, we obviously need to use the representation theory of non-compact
so(n + 1, 1) groups to understand the physical spectrum of kk modes. their exists a
construction for the uirs of the group so(n + 1, 1) [17] completely analogous to the one
for uirs of its maximal compact subgroup so(n + 1). in the case of so(n + 1) a unitary
irreducible representation is determined by a set of numbers mij, (1  i < j  n+1), all of
which are integer or half-integer simultaneously (there are important dierences between
n + 1 = 2p and n + 1 = 2p + 1). a vector in the representation space is denoted by |mij >,
where mij provide a complete set of highest weight labels (named gelfand-zetlin (gz)
labels) which uniquely determine an irreducible representation. the labels mij obey the
following conditions

m2k+1,1  m2k,1  m2k+1,1  . . .  m2k+1,k1  m2k,k  m2k+1,k
|m2k,1|  m2k1,1  m2k,2  . . .  m2k,k1  m2k1,k1  m2k,k ,

(2.5)

where k = 1, . . . , p  1 if n + 1  2zz and k = 1, . . . , p if n + 1  2zz + 1.

based on this result it can be shown [17] that the uirs of so(n+1, 1) (with important
dierences between n + 1 = 2p and n + 1 = 2p + 1) are described by a set of so(n + 1)
gz labels mij , satisfying certain inequalities, along with a weight  = n/2 + i. one
important property of the uirs of so(n+1, 1) is that irreducible representation of so(n+
1) occur within with multiplicity one or not at all [17].

for example, in the case of so(2p, 1) their exist uirs with so(2p) content described

by the following requirement on the gz labels

|m2p,1|  m2p+1,1  . . .  m2p+1,p1  m2p,p

(2.6)

3

where m2p+1,j = 0, 1/2, 1, . . . for 1  j  p  1 and the weight  = p + i, with
 > 0. these uirs are labelled d(m2p+1,1 . . . m2p+1,p1, i). the complete list of uirs
of so(n + 1, 1) in this notation is given in [17]. we follow this notation and the results
of [17] in the main body of the paper. note that in the gz-notation these representations
typically consist of a nite number of innite towers.

gz labels form a particularly convenient basis for understanding the harmonic analysis
on kaluza-klein (kk) supergravity [18,19] on any coset space g/h [5].
in particular,
the well known adsm  sn backgrounds of kk supergravity can be understood as coset
spaces, upon the euclideanization of the relevant adsm spaces - adsm  sm. then
the spectrum of kk supergravity on adsm  sn can be obtained from the harmonic
analysis on g/h = so(m + 1)/so(m)  so(n + 1)/so(n).
in this analysis [5], one
xes the h representations which describe the content of all supergravity elds, and then
one expands these elds in terms of only those representations of g which contain the
xed h representations. the gz, or highest weight labels, provide a natural basis for the
implementation of this procedure [10].

more precisely,

let the gz labels of a xed h representation be denoted by

(1, 2, . . . , r)(1, 2, . . . , q1), where

1  2  . . .  |r|;

1  2  . . .  q1

(2.7)

and analogously, denote the gz labels of a g representation by (1, 2, . . . , r)(1, 2, . . . , q),
where 3

1  2  . . .  r;

1  2  . . .  |q| .

(2.8)

then according to a theorem by gelfand and zetlin [8] (vol. 3), the above h representation
is contained in the decomposition of the above g representation provided

1  1  2  . . .  r  |r|
1  1  2  . . .  q1  |q| .

(2.9)

this theorem combined with the representation theory of so(n + 1, 1) can be used to
easily read o the corresponding uirs of the relevant so(n + 1, 1) spectrum generating
algebra, given the eld content of a particular supergravity theory 4.

3 here, for illustrational purposes, we have assumed that m + 1  2zz + 1 such that the rank
does not change between so(m + 1) and so(m). similarly, we take n + 1  2zz. this also shows

how the bound on the i, . . . , i are dierent depending on the parity of m + 1 (n + 1).

4 for the readers convenience we also give the relation between the dynkin basis (commonly
used in the supergravity literature) and the gz basis. for the case of so(2p) denote the gz basis

by a set of integers (l1, l2, . . . lp); then, the dynkin labels are give by a set of integers (a1, a2, . . . , ap)

such that a1 = l1  l2, . . . , ap1 = lp1  lp, ap = lp1 + lp. similarly, for the case of so(2p + 1),

one has a1 = l1  l2, . . . , ap1 = lp1  lp, ap = 2lp.

3. type iib supergravity on ads5  s5

given these technical tools, we now turn to actual physical applications. we consider
the case of iib supergravity on ads5  s5, since for this case the actual boundary cft
of the proposed duality is precisely dened; it is n = 4 su (n ) super yang-mills theory
(sym) in four-dimensions. although we discuss in detail other supergravity adsd+1  sn
examples (see tables 2. - 4.), we study the ads5  s5 case (table 1.) when we discuss the
action of the sga on the full string theory.

the bosonic sector of the ten-dimensional iib supergravity consists of the following

representations of the little group so(8):

1c + 28c + 35v + 35c

(3.1)

(the dilaton and the axion, rr and ns 2-forms, the graviton, and the self-dual rr 4-form).
the fermionic sector (spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 elds) is given by

8c,s + 56c,s .

(3.2)

to understand the reduction of this spectrum on ads5s5, we rst look at how the so(8)
little group representations break up into representations of so(5) so(3) on the tangent
bundle of ads5  s5. in particular, we want to discuss the appearance of physical modes
(i.e., those modes that appear as poles in the ads5 bulk propagators) and illustrate the
general procedure by considering only the bosonic elds 5.

on the tangent bundle of ads5 s5 the ten-dimensional little group so(8) splits into
so(5)  so(3). we start our discussion by decomposing the so(8) representations for
the graviton, hab, and the self-dual four form, aabcd, in terms of so(5)  so(3) 6. we get

and

hab :

35v  11 + 15 + 53 + 141,

aabcd :

35c  51 + 103,

respectively. we are interested in those representations of so(6)  so(3) which contain
the above representations of hab and aabcd, since so(6) is the isometry group of s5. it is
convenient to list these representations in terms of their highest weight labels under so(6).
the resulting so(6) labels, with their so(3) dimensions, are

(l, 0, 0)1,

(l, 0, 0)5,

(l, 0, 0)3, (l, 1, 0)3,

(l, 0, 0)1, (l, 1, 0)1, (l, 2, 0)1

5 we thank j. de boer for very useful discussions on this topic.
6 we use latin indices for ten-dimensional elds, greek indices from the beginning of the al-

phabet for sn and greek indices from the middle of the alphabet for adsd+1.

5

for the graviton and

(l, 0, 0)1, (l, 1, 0)1,

(l, 1, 0)3, (l, 1, 1)3

for the self-dual four form, respectively. in order to understand which modes appear as
physical from the point of view of the bulk ads5 space we need to consider the action of
the ads5 little group so(4) on the above representations of so(6)  so(3). these are
uniquely lifted to representations of so(6)  so(4), from which we directly read o the
physical modes propagating in the bulk ads5 space. we get

h :

h :

h :
h
 :
a :

a :

(l, 0, 0)(3,3)

(l, 1, 0)(2,2)

(l, 2, 0)(1,1)

(l, 0, 0)(1,1)

(l, 1, 1)(3,1) + (l, 1, 1)(1,3)
(l, 1, 0)(2,2)

(3.3)

a :

(l, 0, 0)(1,1)

e.g., the (3, 3) of so(4) is given in terms of 1 + 3 + 5 of so(3) and so on. note also that
there will be a mixing between modes with the same quantum numbers, such as h
 and
a. in the tables 1.-4. we suppress this mixing and list the modes as above.

by comparing to [9] we see that group theory indeed accounts for all the physical

modes. one can also easily extend this analysis to the fermionic part of the spectrum.

the kk towers of physical modes cannot in general be t alone into uirs of the
conformal group of s5 - so(6, 1). in order to get full uirs of so(6, 1) we also need to
consider gauge modes (modes that do not appear as poles in the ads5 bulk propagators).
the most convenient procedure for the identication of kk towers of both physical and
gauge modes, and the corresponding uirs of so(6, 1), is to look at the euclidean ads5 
s5 space as a coset space - g/h  so(6)/so(5)  so(6)/so(5). we list the various
kk modes in terms of so(5)  so(5) highest weight labels, and then determine which
so(6)  so(6) representations contain these xed so(5)  so(5) representations using
the theorem of gelfand and zetlin reviewed in section 2. here it is important that we
started with the full ten-dimensional tangent space so(10) and not just the little group
so(8) as we would otherwise not see the gauge modes. from the so(6) highest weight, gz
labels, we directly read o the corresponding uirs of so(6, 1). these uirs must occur;
the theorem above [8] implies that a complete set of orthonormal harmonic functions on
s5 forms a uir of the conformal group of s5, that is so(6, 1).

to make our procedure described clearer, we choose as an example the elds which
come from the reduction of the ten-dimensional graviton. we write the so(5) represen-
tations of these elds in terms of gz labels; they are the (0, 0)gz, (1, 0)gz and (2, 0)gz

6

representations. from (2.9), the (2, 0)gz representation of so(5), a scalar on ads5, is
contained in the so(6) representations with labels: (l + 2, 2, 0)gz, (l + 2, 1, 0)gz, and
(l + 2, 0, 0)gz (l  0) which together form the d1(2; 5/2) uir of so(6,1). only the
symmetric tensors with so(6) labels (l + 2, 2, 0)gz are physical, matching with h in
(3.3), while the others correspond to gauge modes. the (1, 0)gz representation of so(5)
is contained in the so(6) representations (l + 1, 1, 0)gz (physical modes matching h)
and (l + 1, 0, 0)gz (gauge modes) which form the d1(1; 5/2) representation of so(6, 1).
finally, the (0, 0)gz representation is contained in the so(6) representations (l, 0, 0)gz
which form the d2(5/2) representation of so(6, 1) (physical modes matching h ). the
elds in this tower couple to the symmetric trace operators on the cft side.

in the discussion above, modes which usually are ignored because they can be gauged
away are crucial to the faithful action of the conformal group of s5 on the kaluza-klein
spectrum. other gauge modes also appear in the spectrum in complete representations
of the sga. for example, an analysis of the mode expansion on ads5 is enough to show
that the ten-dimensional graviton also yields a complete tower of vector gauge modes. we
will ignore these complete towers of gauge modes, and only mention gauge modes which
combine with physical modes to give uirs of the conformal group. generally, gauge modes
are probably associated with the diagonal u (1) group on the boundary, whose role in the
ads/cf t duality is still not completely understood (see for example [20]).

we now complete our analysis of the sga representations which appear in the super-
gravity spectrum of ads5  s5. the antisymmetric tensor, the two-form a , gives rise
to a tower d2(5/2) of anti-symmetric chiral and anti-chiral tensor elds, all describing
physical modes. the vector a gives rise to the towers of vectors that make up the
d1(1; 5/2) representation with only the tower with modes of the form (l + 1, 1, 0)gz in
d1(1; 5/2) physical. the scalar a gives rise to two physical kk-towers, modes of the
form (l + 1, 1, 1)gz, which make up the d0(1, 1; 5/2) representation.

the rank-four antisymmetric self-dual tensor gives rise to chiral and anti-chiral
two-forms a with towers making up two d0(1, 1; 5/2) representations. each
d0(1, 1; 5/2) has two physical towers with (l + 1, 1, 1)gz of so(6), adding up to four
towers of physical two-forms . the vector a gives a tower d1(1; 5/2) of vectors but
only the (l + 1, 1, 0)gz tower of d1(1; 5/2) describes physical modes. the scalar mode,
a, mixes with the h
 scalar as can be seen from our earlier discussion, with each of
the mass eigenmodes giving rise to d2(5/2). finally, the complex scalar, in terms of the
axion and dilaton elds, gives rise to yet one more physical kk-tower of complex scalars,
d2(5/2).

the spin-1/2 eld  gives twin towers of chiral and anti-chiral spinors in the
d(1/2, 1/2; 5/2 + i) representation. each of these contains physical modes (l +
1/2, 1/2, 1/2)gz, so each d(1/2, 1/2; 5/2) yields two towers. the chiral and anti-chiral
gravitini  also come in the representation d(1/2, 1/2; 5/2+i), each with a total of two

7

physical towers with modes of the form (l + 1/2, 1/2, 1/2)gz. finally, we get kk-towers
of chiral and anti-chiral spin-1/2 elds from , each in the d(3/2, 1/2; 5/2 + i) rep-
resentation, and each of these yielding physical modes of the form (l + 3/2, 1/2, 1/2)gz.
we summarize these results in table 1. tables 2. - 4. which contain the elds and uirs
for the cases of ads4  s7, ads7  s4 and ads3  s3 respectively, are obtained following
the same procedure.

4. conformal eld theory, operator generating algebra, massive string modes

we want to discuss what the sga for the kaluza-klein states of adsd+1  sn means
on the dual cft side. we concentrate on the ads5/cf t4 correspondence, the n = 4
su (n ) super yang mills theory in four-dimensions. other cases are more dicult because
the dual cft is not easily described, though we believe that similar arguments to those
below can be applied there as well.

we start from the fact that each supergravity kk tower corresponds to a set of chiral
primaries on the cft side with appropriate so(6) r-charges [2]. chiral primaries appear
in the trace of a symmetric product of n = 4 chiral superelds [14]. for example, the
traceless part of the following operator

t r(w (i1w i2  . . .  w ip))

(4.1)

corresponds to the kk states of iib supergravity on ads5  s5, where w is the n = 4
chiral supereld. we have shown that these kk states belong to uirs of the so(6, 1)
sga. given the map between kk modes and cft chiral primaries, we naturally expect
that the complete set of uirs of the so(6, 1) sga listed in table 1 corresponds to

t r(w i1)  t r(w (i1w i2))  . . .  t r(w (i1w i2  . . .  w ip))  . . .

(4.2)

note that there exists an ambiguity as to whether or not w i transforms in su (n ) or
u (n ) [2][14]. this ambiguity is most likely related to the inclusion of gauge modes in the
complete so(6, 1) uirs. taking the lowest component of (4.2), the operators made up of
the traceless part of

t r((i1 i2  . . .  ip))

(4.3)
( is the 0 0 component of the n = 4 chiral supereld w ) t into the d2(5/2) of rep-
resentation of so(6, 1). modulo subtleties involving gauge modes and the extra u (1), the
other components of (4.1) ll out the remaining uirs listed in table 1. this cft coun-
terpart of the spectrum generating algebra of kk supergravity we call operator generating
algebra (oga).

8

it is natural to ask whether this operator generating algebra extends to all the op-
erators in n = 4 sym, including the non-chiral ones which correspond to massive string
modes. in order to check this, we would have to classify and organize all the non-chiral
operators on the cft side. we do not know of any such classication. what we do know is
that part of the so(6, 1) oga acts on the chiral primaries by tensoring with a supereld
in the 6 of so(6) and symmetrizing. how does this procedure generalize to non-chiral
primaries? we sketch a natural proposal as follows. given an operator t r(o(w )), a set
of uirs of the so(6, 1) oga is generated by the following operators

t r(o(w )w i1)  t r(o(w )w (i1w i2))  . . .  t r(o(w )w (i1w i2  . . .  w ip))  . . . (4.4)
the fact that operators such as t r(o(w )w i1) are not necessarily irreducible and give
direct sums of so(6) representations is useful for generating operators dual to both physical
modes and gauge modes. unfortunately, since we have not explicitly determined the
generators of the proposed so(6, 1) oga, we cannot actually prove that various operators
belong to uirs of this oga. the issue also arises as to how to deal with the possible mixing
of dierent operators within the same uir, a problem which already exists for the chiral
primary operators.

let us illustrate how our proposal for an oga might work by considering the so-
called konishi multiplet on the cft side. in terms of the sym superelds, this multiplet
is written as t r(wiw i) [14]. it has been suggested that the konishi multiplet corresponds
to massive string states propagating in ads5 [14,15]. consider the scalar operator in
the konishi multiplet which is the 4 4 component of t r(wiw i) and transforms in the
105 = (4, 0, 0)gz of so(6). suppose we assume that it sits naturally at the bottom of a
(l + 4, 0, 0)gz kk tower of so(6). on the ads side this is what we would expect from
scalars coming from a ten-dimensional four-tensor reduced on s5. a good candidate for
the appropriate so(6, 1) uir is then d1(4; 5/2). it is made up of the towers

(l + 4, 0, 0)gz, (l + 4, 1, 0)gz, (l + 4, 2, 0)gz, (l + 4, 3, 0)gz, (l + 4, 4, 0)gz.

(4.5)

none of the extra towers in (4.5) have operators which can appear in the konishi multiplet,
but if we take into account the whole set of operators given by t r(wiw iw (i1  . . . w ip)),
then at p = 1, 2, 3, 4 we nd operators (dual to bulk scalars) with so(6) weights

(4, 1, 0)gz, (4, 2, 0)gz, (4, 3, 0)gz, (4, 4, 0)gz

(4.6)

which could sit at the bottoms of the extra towers. it is important to note that we do
not know whether the operators above are dual to gauge modes or physical modes, since
we lack a precise rule for making this distinction. still, our primitive t for the konishi

multiplet is an indication that there might exist an oga, so(6, 1), on the cft side which
organizes even the non-chiral operators.

let us now address these issues from the ads side. what happens with stringy, mas-
sive modes on the ads5 side? these modes do not have protected anomalous dimensions
on the cft side. this is clear, since if we expand the stringy elds in s5 spherical harmon-
ics their ten-dimensional masses will contribute  terms to their kk reduced ads masses.
the non-linear nature of the equations relevant to stringy modes will contribute further
corrections and will also mix modes with the same so(6) quantum numbers. nevertheless,
using the theorem explained above [8,6], the orthonormal basis of harmonic functions on
s5 provides uirs of the sga so(6, 1). thus, we expect that even the massive stringy
modes can be t in uirs of this sga. there is, however, a subtlety here: to prove that
so(6, 1) is the sga of the full iib string theory on ads5  s5 we need to identify all the
kk modes generated by the massive stringy modes, and then t them explicitly (as we
have done with the massless kk modes) in the relevant uirs of so(6, 1).

one way of getting to the string theory on ads5  s5 is to start with the at ten-
dimensional string and then perturb it with an rr operator (as in [21]) such that the
theory ows to the ads5  s5 background [3]. one can contemplate a connection between
the large radius limit of ads5  s5 and the at ten-dimensional space, by taking n  
and keeping gy m nite on the cft side.
in this limit the states from the ads5 side
should presumably map into states propagating in the at ten-dimensional space, the
corresponding vertex operators should match, etc. the kk reduction of the massive string
modes on s5 from at ten dimensions should get rearranged into the massive spectrum of
the string on ads5  s5. also, on both sides there should exist a natural action of the
conformal group of s5. if we can show that this group acts as an sga on the quantum
ten-dimensional spectrum reduced on s5, we expect the conformal group of s5 to appear
as an sga for the string theory quantized directly about the ads5  s5 background.

let us examine the kk reduction of the rst massive level of the at iib string on s5.
the multiplet transforms in the (44 + 84 + 128)2 of so(9) and has 2562 states. we con-
sider perturbations around the classical solution caused by the presence of massive string
modes in this multiplet. we apply the same harmonic analysis used on the supergravity
modes, and decompose the so(9) representations coming from (44 + 84 + 128)2 in terms
of so(5)  so(4) representations 7. as before, we work in the gz basis, which enables
us to read o the corresponding uirs of so(6, 1). we consider briey one example of
this particular procedure. if we look at 44  44 we nd a 450 of so(9), in addition to
other representations of so(9) which we will ignore for now. the 450 is a four-tensor
eld in ten dimensions. it decomposes into - among others - a (4, 0)gz of so(5) which is
contained in (l + 4, 4, 0)gz, (l + 4, 3, 0)gz, (l + 4, 2, 0)gz, (l + 4, 1, 0)gz, (l + 4, 0, 0)gz of

so(6) and generates the d1(4; 5/2) uir of so(6, 1). this particular uir appeared in
our discussion of the konishi multiplet. the same procedure can be extended to all elds
at this massive level, and to all massive levels.

in our analysis group theory has supplied us with details about the spectrum. how-
ever, there are subtleties which can only be addressed by examining the corrected classical
equations of motion; proper identication of physical and gauge modes as well as the mix-
ing of various kk modes. these phenomena happen already at the massless level, so they
are not surprising. these subtleties do not change the fact that physical and/or gauge
modes form uirs of so(6, 1)! so, the conclusion seems to be that the so(6, 1) sga from
supergravity extends to the full string theory. of course, in order to prove this statement
one would have to examine all massive modes explicitly, and address the question of mixing
and identication of physical and gauge modes.

5. discussion

to conclude, in this paper we have listed the spectrum generating algebras for string
theory and m-theory compactied on various backgrounds of the form adsd+1  sn. we
have identied the representations of these algebras which make up the classical supergrav-
ity spectra and we argued for the existence of these spectrum generating algebras in the
classical string/m-theory. we also discussed the role of the spectrum generating algebras
on the conformal eld theory side in the framework of ads/cft correspondence.

one case we have not explicitly considered but which can be analyzed in the same
way is the ads2  s2 background. the corresponding boundary theory is some sort of
conformal quantum mechanics, which is not well understood [13]. whatever that boundary
theory might be, there should exist an so(3, 1) sga algebra on the supergravity/string
side and a corresponding oga on the conformal quantum mechanics side.

our methods should also apply to the case of string theory on adssn/g [22], where
g is a discrete subgroup of the isometry group of the sphere. it would be interesting to
understand the action of sgas in this case.

one problem where we expect the concept of sgas to have a dynamical meaning is

in the computation of correlation functions within the framework of ads/cft duality.

finally, an interesting question regarding sgas concerns their interpretation in the
nite n case of ads/cft duality (strong conjecture). jevicki and ramgoolam [16] have
proposed that quantum deformed isometries should be relevant in this case. we note that
there exists an analog of peter-weyl theorem for the case of su (2)q - see [8](vol. 3). the
harmonic functions for a q-deformed sphere can be also found in [8](vol. 3).
it seems
natural to expect that the harmonic functions over so(n)q t into uirs of so(n + 1, 1)q,
thus generalizing our previous results.
in view of the proposal put forward in [16], we
expect the full string theory on adsd+1  sm to exhibit q-deformed sgas.
