abstract

we present a systematic and from the ground up analysis of the
minimal coupling type of gauging of yang-mills symmetries in (2,2)-
supersymmetric 1+1-dimensional spacetime. unlike in the familiar 3+1-
dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric case, we nd several distinct types
of minimal coupling symmetry gauging, and so several distinct types of
gauge (super)elds, some of which entirely novel. also, we nd that cer-
tain (quartoid) constrained superelds can couple to no gauge supereld
at all, others (haploid ones) can couple only very selectively, while still
others (non-minimal, i.e., linear ones) couple universally to all gauge
superelds.

1. introduction

ref. [1] presented an intrinsically 1+1-dimensional analysis, from scratch, of the basic
building blocks in (2,2)-supersymmetric theories: the superconstrained superelds, most
often used to represent matter. this analysis re-established some earlier results [2,3,4,5],
generalized them in several dierent aspects, and uncovered some hitherto unknown phe-
nomena and mechanisms leading to several open questions and new research topics.

while comprehensive in its study of the variously constrained matter superelds,
ref.
[1] postponed the study of gauge (super)elds and their couplings to matter.
this important issue is analyzed herein, again from an intrinsically 1+1-dimensional ap-
proach, from scratch, and loosely following the methodology of  4.2.b of ref. [6] (p.
169). we nd two new types of symmetry gauging, besides the one that descends from
3+1-dimensional, n =1 supersymmetric theories by dimensional reduction and its mirror-
twisted version [3,4].

this article is organized as follows: the remaining part of this section presents the
basics of 1+1-dimensional (2,2)-superspace and sets up the notation; further details are
found in appendix a. the gauge-covariant (super)derivatives are dened and the eld
strength superelds calculated in section 2, with the details of jacobi identity calculations
deferred to the appendix b. section 3 analyzes the most general minimal coupling of
gauge superelds with matter. some special types of symmetry gauging are discussed in
section 4. section 5 discusses the component eld content within the gauge superelds,
with details deferred to appendix c. the choice of the lagrangian density for matter
superelds with gauged symmetries is discussed in section 6, generalizing the already
immense palette presented in ref. [1]. finally, section 7 summarizes the presented results
and discusses some further topics.

we emphasize that our purpose here is to enlist all logical possibilities, and explore
their consistency and major features, but leave open the details and issues of application.

1.1. (1, 1|2, 2) superspacetime
(super)eld theory in 1+1-dimensional spacetime is crucially distinct from that in higher
dimensions because of its lorentz group, so(1, 1): being abelian, all of its irreducible rep-
resentations are 1-dimensional. for example, the coordinate 2-vector (0, 1) decomposes
into the (light-cone) characteristic coordinates =def= 1
2 (0 +1). these
are eigenfunctions of the lorentz (boost) generator 1) and the group elements of so(1, 1):

2 (01) and =| def= 1

b(=, =| ) = (=, +=| ) ,
u (=, =| ) = ( ei =, e+i =| ) ,

b

def= (10+01) ,

u 

def= eib .

(1.1)

1) the eigenvalue of the lorentz boost operator, extended to include total angular momentum in
the usual way, equals the spin projection, and will therefore be denoted by j3 although it does not
stem from its 3+1-dimensional namesake. moreover, all representations of the 1+1-dimensional
lorentz group being 1-dimensional, spin and spin projection are one and the same, and we will
call j3 simply spin.

 1 

all other tensors (spinors) decompose similarly into 1-component objects. upon the fre-
quently practiced analytic continuation 0  i0, (=| , =)  (z, z): the light-cone
structure becomes a complex structure and u becomes the winding number (holomorphic
homogeneity) operator. the sub- and superscripts  then simply denote the winding
number (spin in real time) in units of 1
2 (h). functions depending on only =| or only =
are called left- and right-movers, respectively, and become holomorphic (complex-analytic)
and anti-holomorphic (complex-antianalytic) functions upon analytic continuation to imag-
inary time.

1.2. (2,2)-superbasics

the (2,2)-supersymmetry algebra involves the supersymmetry charges q and q, which
satisfy (adapting from refs. [7,2]; comparison with refs. [5,6] is provided in appendix a):

(cid:8) q , q(cid:9) = 2i= ,
here =|
momentum operator and h=  i0=  i

=| =(0+1) and =

def= 

def= 

2 (=| =) is the linear
2 (=| +=) is the hamiltonian (energy) operator.
equipping the world-sheet with anticommuting fermionic coordinates, ,  , the

= =(01). p=  i1=  i

(cid:8) q+ , q+(cid:9) = 2i=| .

(1.2)

supercharges are realized as dierential operators on the (super) world-sheet:

q
q+

def=  + i =
def= + + i +=|

q
q+

def=   i= ,
def= +  i +=| ,

the spinorial derivatives

d
d+

def=   i =
def= +  i +=|

(1.3)

(1.4)

(1.5)

d
d+

def=  + i= ,
def= + + i +=| ,
def= exp(cid:8)i(q +  q)(cid:9).
(cid:8) d+ , d+(cid:9) = 2i=| .

are covariant with respect to supersymmetry transformations: {q, d} = 0 = {q, d},
whereupon [u,, d] = 0 = [u,, d], with u,

finally the d, ds close virtually the same algebra (1.2), as do the q, qs:

(cid:8) d , d(cid:9) = 2i= ,

all anticommutators among the q, q, d, d, other than (1.2) and (1.5), vanish.

berezin superintegrals are by denition equivalent to partial superderivatives, and
up to total (world-sheet) spacetime derivatives 2) (which we ignore, assuming world-sheets
without boundaries) equivalent to covariant superderivatives [7,6,8,9]. following ref. [1],
we use (see appendix a for further denitions and conventions):

z d4 (. . .) def= 1

8(cid:8)[d, d], [d+, d+](cid:9)(. . .)(cid:12)(cid:12) def= (d4 . . .)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

2) hereafter, total derivative will stand for total (world-sheet) spacetime derivative.

(1.6)

where | means setting  = 0 =  . integration over a fermionic subspace is formally
achieved by inserting a fermionic dirac delta-function (see appendix a), so that:

z d2 [. . .]  1
z d2/ [. . .]  1
z d2r [. . .]  1

2(cid:2)d, d+(cid:3)[. . .](cid:12)(cid:12) ,
2(cid:2)d, d+(cid:3)[. . .](cid:12)(cid:12) ,
2(cid:2)d, d(cid:3)[. . .](cid:12)(cid:12) ,

are integrals over the various halves of the fermionic coordinates.

z d2 [. . .]  1
z d2\ [. . .]  1
z d2l [. . .]  1

2(cid:2)d+, d(cid:3)[. . .](cid:12)(cid:12) ,
2(cid:2)d+, d(cid:3)[. . .](cid:12)(cid:12) ,
2(cid:2)d+, d+(cid:3)[. . .](cid:12)(cid:12) ,

(1.7a, b)

(1.7c, d)

(1.7e, f)

2. gauge-covariant superderivatives

in the presence of a gauge symmetry, all derivatives, including those in the berezin in-
tegrals (1.6) and (1.7), need to be covariantized. this modies the supersymmetry
algebra (1.5), and this modication is used here as the starting point for the analysis.
somewhat formally, the berezin integrals are easily turned into gauge-covariant ones, by
replacing ds  s; see appendix a for details.

2.1. denitions

much of the subsequent analysis follows the procedures used in ref. [6], although the
notation will be adjusted to conform with refs. [2,7]. we start by dening the covariant
(super)derivatives

 = d  i ,
= = =  i= ,

 = d  i ,
=| = =|  i=| .

(2.1a)

(2.1b)

the s are lie algebra valued gauge super elds and are, in general, linear combinations
of gauge superelds for the direct summands in the possibly non-simple lie algebra.

for brevity and convenience, the gauge coupling constants were absorbed in the de-
nition of the gauge superelds ; these can be reinserted later by replacing   g. also,
recall that the superderivatives (1.4) already include a connection  1
2 -form coecient. for
example, d and d include  = and = as the (derivative-valued! )  1
2 -form coe-
cients: spacetime derivatives here play the role of the generators of the spacetime trans-
lation group, and the (fermionic) gauge superelds here are simply the supercoordinates
  and .

the (super)derivatives (2.1) are all covariant with respect to the general gauge trans-

formation:

 = g  g1 ,

x = gx ,

(2.2)

where x represents any (homogeneously transforming) matter (super)eld, and g is
the operator implementing the gauge transformation. typically, we assume the gauge

 3 

transformation operator, g, to be unitary, so that the transformation of the matter
supereld (2.2) implies

whence preserving the norm (squared),

x = xg = xg1 ,

(2.3)

(2.4)

kxk2 def= tr(cid:0)xix i(cid:1) = tr(cid:0)x ixi(cid:1) ,

where i simply counts the superelds x i, each of which is a collection of superelds forming
a given representation of the gauge group. because of the transposition involved in (2.3),
the action of gauge-covariant derivatives on x is awkward: the derivative part of  should
act from the left as usual, but the gauge supereld part should act from the right. we
therefore calculate (implicitly) using a double transposition:

(ox) def= (otx t)t = ( ox) ,

(2.5)
where o denotes any gauge-covariant operator, o and ot its complex conjugate and
transpose, respectively; over-bar and dagger interchangeably denote hermitian conjuga-
tion: o  o. in practical calculation, and in cases when above matrix notation would
be ambiguous or confusing, we resort to the explicit gauge group index notation. assuming
that the matter elds form a representation of the gauge group the elements of which are
indexed by , , . . ., eqs. (2.2), (2.3) and (2.5) become:



 = g

 g1

 

 ,
x = x g

x = g

 x  ,

 = x g1

 ,

and

(ox)

def= (o

x) = ( o

 x ) ,

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

respectively. this disentangles ordering issues and the matrix action of the gauge elds
on the matter elds: re-ordering now solely depends on the spin/statistics of the involved
superelds and operators. for most of this article, however, we suppress explicit gauge
group indices, hoping that the reader will always be able to discern the implied meaning
of the more compact implicit matrix notation.


the gauge superelds, , of course transform inhomogeneously:

 = g  g1  ig1(dg) .

(2.9)

field strength superelds and torsion superelds, f and t, are dened by (anti)commutation
of the covariant derivatives (2.1), according the general formula 3)

(cid:2) , (cid:9) = t  if ,

(2.10)

3) here [ , } denotes the (anti)commutator, as appropriate for the (anti)commuted quantities;

see appendix a for precise denition and use.

 4 

which determines f, t in terms of the gauge superelds  upon using eqs. (2.1). because
of their denition (2.10), eld strength superelds and torsion superelds are also covariant:
with respect to the gauge transformation g, they transform just like the s do (2.2).

next, we generalize the standard supersymmetry algebra by inserting the so far unre-

stricted eld strength superelds (choosing numerical coecients for later convenience):

{, +} def= a ,
{, +} def= b ,
{, } def= 2c= ,
{, } = 2i= ,
[, =] def= w ,
[+, =] def= w ,
[, =| ] def= +w+ ,
[+, =| ] def= +w| ,
[=, =| ] def= if ,

{, +} def= a ,
{, +} def= b ,
{+, +} def= 2c=| ,
{+, +} = 2i=| ,
[, =] def= w ,
[+, =] def= w ,
[, =| ] def= +w+ ,
[+, =| ] def= +w| ,
{=, =| } def= +2 ,

(2.11a)

(2.11b)

(2.11c)

(2.11d)

(2.11e)

(2.11f)

(2.11g)

(2.11h)

(2.11i)

where  is the gauge-covariant dalembertian (wave operator). notice that the eld
strengths a, b, c, w are all complex 4), the cs being dened by the conjugates of
eqs. (2.11c), and no new eld strength has been introduced in eqs. (2.11d), as it would
merely redene the gauge superelds =, =| . also, all torsion vanishes, except for
 = 2i = t =|++ as it appears already in eqs. (2.11d). this is because the only derivative-
t =
valued connection 1-forms are within the superderivatives, d, d, and so the torsion
content is unchanged by the covariantization (2.1).

the reader familiar with the 3+1-dimensional supersymmetry algebra modied by a
gauge symmetry and its dimensional reduction to 1+1-dimensional spacetime will realize
that a in (2.11a) contains the two gauge (super)eld components that are transversal to
the 1+1-dimensional subspace. naturally, the anticommutators in (2.11a) yield no torsion-
and-spacetime derivative term, t, on the right hand side, as these 3+1-dimensional
spacetime derivatives are transversal to the 1+1-dimensional spacetime of our interest and
by the assumption of dimensional reduction, everything is a constant in these transversal
directions.

finally, note that the berezin integration formulae (1.6) and (1.7) also need to be

covariantized; see appendix a.

4) being rst order bosonic derivatives, the =, =| are antihermitian; the above denitions of

the ws then ensure them to be the hermitian conjugates of the ws.

 5 

2.2. potential superelds

the covariant (super)derivatives (2.1) must satisfy the graded jacobi identities. after
straightforward algebra (see appendix b), we obtain the following relationships:

eight of the jacobi identities involving the covariant superderivatives (2.1a) com-
pletely determine the fermionic eld strength superelds, w and w, in terms of the
(gauge-covariant superderivatives 5) of) a, a, b, b, c=, c=| :

w =  i
w =  i
w+ = i

w+ = i

2(cid:0)[, a] + [, b](cid:1) , w =  i
2(cid:0)[, a] + [, b](cid:1) , w =  i
2(cid:0)[+, a] + [+, b](cid:1) ,
w| = i
2(cid:0)[+, a] + [+, b](cid:1) ,
w| = i

2 [, c=] ,
2 [, c=] ;
2 [+, c=| ] ,
2 [+, c=| ] .

(2.12a)

(2.12b)

(2.12c)

(2.12d)

we therefore call a, a, b, b, c=, c=| , c=, c=| the gauge potential superelds.

the four jacobi identities involving three equal covariant superderivatives impose the

constraints

[, c=] = 0
[+, c=| ] = 0
finally, the remaining eight jacobi

[, c=] = 0 ,
[+, c=| ] = 0 .

(2.13a, b)

(2.13c, d)

identities among the spinorial superderiva-

tives (2.1a) imply the following curious relationships:

and:

[+, a] = [, c=| ] ,
[, a] = [+, c=] ,

[, a] = [+, c=] ,
[+, a] = [, c=| ] .

[, b] = [+, c=] ,
[, b] = [+, c=] ,

[+, b] = [, c=| ] ,
[+, b] = [, c=| ] ,

(2.14a)

(2.14b)

(2.15a)

(2.15b)

most of the jacobi identities among two spinorial and one vectorial covariant derivative
are identically satised upon using the previous identities 6). two of them, however, express
the bosonic eld strength supereld f in terms of the spinorial eld strengths, and in two
dierent ways:

f = + 1

f = + 1

2(cid:0){+, w} + {+, w}(cid:1) ,
2(cid:0){, w+} + {, w+}(cid:1) .

(2.16a)

(2.16b)

5) we follow the practice of writing [, y } for a gauge-covariant (super)derivative a lie algebra-
valued supereld y , and (x) for a gauge-covariant (super)derivative of a supereld x in any
representation of the lie group other than the adjoint.

6) they do provide (super)dierential relations between eld strength superelds, such as
[=, a] = {, w} + {+, w}, [=, b] = {, w} + {+, w}, [=, c=] = {, w}
and so on; for a complete listing, see appendix b.

 6 

the half-sum and the dierence of these produce the standard results [6]:

f = 1

4(cid:0){(, w+)} + {(, w+)}(cid:1) ,

0 = {[, w+]} + {[, w+]} ,

(2.16c)

(2.16d)

where grouping of indices in parentheses indicates their symmetrization, while bracketing
indicates antisymmetrization. eq. (2.16d), also known as the bisection formula (ref. [6],
p. 158), is easy to rewrite in the more familiar form, w =  w  (eq. (6.12) in
ref. [7]).

as another consequence of the jacobi identities, the spin  3
are also related to their conjugates through bisection formulae

2 eld strengths w| , w

{, w} + {, w} = 0 ,
{+, w| } + {+, w| } = 0 ,

(2.16e)

note that the summands in the bisection formula (2.16d) have (total) spin 0, while those
in (2.16e) have (total) spin 2.

after using eqs. (2.12), (2.16c) becomes:

f = 1

f = i

f = i

2(cid:0)f + f(cid:1) = e(f ) ,
4(cid:16)(cid:8), [+, a](cid:9) (cid:8)+, [, a](cid:9) +(cid:8)[, [+], b](cid:9)(cid:17) ,
4(cid:16)(cid:0)[, +]a(cid:1) +(cid:0)[, +]b(cid:1)(cid:17) ,
 i
4(cid:16)(cid:0)[, +]a(cid:1) +(cid:0)[, +]b(cid:1)(cid:17) .

(2.17a)

(2.17b)

(2.17c)

covariant superderivative of the lie algebra-valued supereld a, written out in long-hand

note that (cid:0)[, +]a(cid:1) is merely an abbreviation for the antisymmetrized second gauge-
as (cid:8), [+, a](cid:9) (cid:8)+, [, a](cid:9).

we see that this eld strength too is thus expressed entirely in terms of the gauge
potential superelds a, a, b, b. notice, however, that f is not related to the c, cs, not
even through the curious relations (2.14) and (2.15)! in fact, the usual bosonic eld
strengths for the c, cs, the spin-2 eld strength superelds, f=,= and f=| ,=| , vanish
identically; see appendix b. from the denition of f in eq. (2.11i), it is clear that its
lowest component eld is the standard yang-mills type eld strength (a.k.a. curvature).
the independence of f from the c, cs then means that the type of extension of the
supersymmetry algebra (2.11c) does not modify the standard yang-mills eld strength.

the jacobi identities among one spinorial and two vectorial covariant derivatives are
all identically satised upon using the earlier identities. finally, the jacobi identities
among three vectorial covariant derivatives are identically satised as there are only two
such derivatives.

 7 

2.3. gauge potential superelds

having started by introducing fermionic and bosonic gauge superelds (2.1), we now deter-
mine the relationship between these and the gauge potentials a, b, c and their conjugates
by expanding the covariant derivatives in (2.11). we nd:

a = i(cid:2){d, +} + {d+, }  i{, +}(cid:3) ,
a = i(cid:2){d, +} + {d+, }  i{, +}(cid:3) ,
b = i(cid:2){d, +} + {d+, }  i{, +}(cid:3) ,
b = i(cid:2){d, +} + {d+, }  i{, +}(cid:3) ,
c= = i(cid:2){d, }  i
c=| = i(cid:2){d+, +}  i
c= = i(cid:2){d, }  i
c=| = i(cid:2){d+, +}  i
finally, eqs. (2.11d) imply that
= =  i
=| =  i

2(cid:2){d, } + {d, }  i{, }(cid:3) ,
2(cid:2){d+, +} + {d+, +}  i{+, +}(cid:3) .

2{, }(cid:3) ,
2{+, +}(cid:3) ,
2{, }(cid:3) ,
2{+, +}(cid:3) .

(2.18a)

(2.18b)

(2.18c)

(2.18d)

(2.18e)

(2.18f)

(2.18g)

(2.18h)

(2.18i)

(2.18j)

from eqs. (2.1b), and all the gauge
thus, both the vectorial gauge superelds =, =|
potential superelds a, b, c and their conjugates from eqs. (2.11a c) are completely
dened in terms of the fermionic gauge superelds ,  from eqs. (2.1a). note that the
lowest components of ,  appear in the gauge potential and vectorial gauge superelds
only through the non-linear terms produced if the gauge lie group is nonabelian. also, the
lowest components of a, b, c, their conjugates and of =, =| are all related only through
these non-linear terms.

since all gauge superelds are in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, we

can expand them over the generators, ti, which satisfy
ltl ,

[tj, tk] = ifjk

(2.19)

l are the structure constants. that is,  = iti, where the i are now sim-
where fjk
ply (anti)commutative gauge elds, as appropriate in (2.1). the expressions (2.18) now
become:

a = i(cid:2){d, l
a = i(cid:2){d, 

l

+} + {d+, 
+} + {d+, l

} + 
} + i

l

j

k


+fjk

k
+fjk

l(cid:3)tl ,
l(cid:3)tk ,

(2.18a)

(2.18b)

and so on.

furthermore, it should be clear that any eld strength supereld added to the r.h.s of
eqs. (2.11d) would again appear on the r.h.s of eqs. (2.18i, j), so that these additional eld
strength superelds and the bosonic gauge superelds become two independent degrees of

 8 

freedomfor each gauge transformation. standard wisdom (see ref. [6], p. 170) has it that
this redundant duplication of gauge elds must be avoidedas we did do by introducing
no eld strength supereld on the r.h.s of eqs. (2.11d).

in retrospect, the modications of the standard supersymmetry algebra shown in
eqs. (2.11) and parametrized by the superelds a, b, c=, c=| , their conjugates and =, =|
represent the most general
minimal coupling covariantization of (2,2)-supersymmetric
theories in 1+1-dimensional spacetime.

3. coupling to constrained matter

the above denitions provide gauge superelds, each of which contains component elds
which are gauge elds for some symmetry. one of the primary interests in gauge (su-
per)elds is of course their coupling to matter, typically represented by some sort of con-
strained (super)elds. a systematic list of such matter superelds was given in ref. [1],
dened to satisfy a (system of) superdierential equation(s).

their coupling to the gauge superelds is induced by the minimal coupling modi-
cation (2.1). lagrangian densities (for a comprehensive listing, see ref. [1]) are dened
as berezin integrals, which in turn are equivalent to (multiple) superderivatives. the co-
variantization (2.1) then indices a covariantization of the lagrangian densities. upon
expansion into component elds, these will then exhibit explicit coupling terms between
matter and gauge component elds.

however, in the presence of gauged symmetries, the dening (super)constraints them-

selves must be modied, and we rst explore the consequences of this modication.

3.1. minimal gauge-covariantly haploid superelds

adapting from ref. [1], we recall the denition of the minimal (rst-order constrained)
gauge-covariantly haploid superelds:

1. chiral :

2. antichiral :

3. twisted-chiral :

4. twisted-antichiral :

5. lefton :

6. righton :

(+) = 0 = () ,
(+) = 0 = () ,
(+) = 0 = () ,
(+) = 0 = () ,
() = 0 = () ,
(+) = 0 = (+) .

it is easy to show that the equations (3.1) are gauge-covariant:

()  (

) = (gg1g) = g() ,

so that

() = 0  g () = 0 .

 9 

(3.1a)

(3.1b)

(3.1c)

(3.1d)

(3.1e)

(3.1f)

(3.2)

(3.3)

note that the above constraints imply that gauge-covariantly haploid superelds commute
with the covariant derivatives which annihilate them; for example:

(+) = 0



[+, ] = 0 .

(3.4)

this commutator form of the constraints will be necessary when reconsidering the above
superelds as multiplicative operators in quantum theory, in which case also the second of
eqs. (2.2) needs to read x = gxg1, where x stands for any multiplicative supereld
operator . of course, when x is in the adjoint representation, it makes perfect sense to
regard it as an operator even as a classical supereld, and expand it over the gauge group
generators, ti.

a simple argument [4] shows that a gauge-covariantly chiral supereld, , cannot be
charged with respect to that part of the gauged lie algebra in which the bs take value:

() = 0

(+) = 0(cid:27)  (cid:0){, +} (cid:1) = 0 ,

thus, using eq. (2.11b) :

(b ) = 0 .

(3.5a)

(3.5b)

that is, the lie group generators in which the bs take values annihilate gauge-covariantly
(anti)chiral superelds. but, as the generators of a lie group are hermitian, the bs are
valued in the same generators as are the bs, and we obtain:

(b ) = 0 = (b ) ,

and (b ) = 0 = (b ) .

(3.5c)

similarly, gauge-covariantly twisted-(anti)chiral superelds are annihilated by those

lie group generators in which the a, as take values:

() = 0

(+) = 0(cid:27) 

thus, using eq. (2.11a) :

(cid:0){, +} (cid:1) = 0 ,

(a ) = 0 .

(3.6a)

(3.6b)

again, as for eqs. (3.5c), it follows that

(a ) = 0 = (a ) ,

and (a ) = 0 = (a ) .

(3.6c)

by a similar calculation, covariant leftons are annihilated by the c=, c=s:

( ) = 0 ,  ( 2
( ) = 0 ,  (

 ) = (c= ) = 0 ,
 ) = (c= ) = 0 ,

2

and covariant rightons by the c=| , c=| s:

(+ ) = 0 ,  ( 2
(+ ) = 0 ,  (

2

+ ) = (c=| ) = 0 ,
+ ) = (c=| ) = 0 .

(3.7a)

(3.7b)

(3.8a)

(3.8b)

in fact, the c=, c=s annihilate all but the covariant rightons:

( ) = 0  (c= ) = 0 = (c= ) ,
( ) = 0  (c= ) = 0 = (c= ) ,
( ) = 0  (c= ) = 0 = (c= ) ,
( ) = 0  (c= ) = 0 = (c= ) .

(3.9a)

(3.9b)

(3.9c)

(3.9d)

in all of these, the middle (second) equality is obtained by re-applying the superderivative
from the left (rst) equality, and the right (third) equality follows from the middle (second)
one since the cs and the cs take values in the same, hermitian, lie group generators.
similarly, the c=| , c=| s annihilate all but the covariant leftons.

the last (third, left) equality in eqs. (3.9) would seem to imply additional constraints
on the matter superelds, such as 2
 = 0. this, however, does not in the least restrict
the gauge-covariantly haploid superelds. in the vanishing gauge coupling constant limit,
  d2
2
  0, and the (would-be) additional constraints are vacuous. for any non-zero
gauge coupling constant, the superelds  are simply c=-chargeless. in particular, the
rst order superderivatives , , + and their conjugates remain unrestricted.

we have therefore proven that the minimal coupling type of interaction between the
gauge superelds (2.1) and gauge-covariantly haploid matter superelds (3.1) is highly
selective, as summarized in table 1.

a, a b, b c=| , c=| c=, c=

,  

























table 1: the minimal coupling of gauge (super)elds (2.11) to gauge-covariantly
haploid matter superelds (3.1) is highly selective: the entry   indicates that
the minimal coupling type interaction is possible, and  that it is impossible.

the results summarized in table 1 may be translated into the gauge group index
notation of eqs. (2.6)(2.8) as follows. the gauge-covariantly chiral superelds,  with
 = 1, . . . , nc must form a representation 7) of ga, the (factor of the) gauge group gauged
by the as. the gauge-covariantly twisted chiral superelds,  with  = 1, . . . , nt must
form a representation of gb, the (factor of the) gauge group gauged by the bs. the
gauge-covariant leftons, a with a = 1, . . . , nl must form a representation of ga, of
7) we assume that the collections of the various gauge-covariantly haploid superelds all form
irreducible representations. reducible representations are then obtained simply by including for-
mal sums of the irreducible ones.

 11 

gb and of g=| , while the gauge-covariant rightons, i with i = 1, . . . , nr must form a
representation of ga, of gb and of g=. in turn, this implies that the as must have three
matrix representations: a
j . the cs on
the other hand must only have one each: c=|

(3.11)

3.2. covariantly quartoid superelds

besides the minimal (rst-order constrained) gauge-covariantly haploid superelds dened
in eqs. (3.1), ref. [1] also lists superelds which are constrained by three rather than
two rst-order superderivatives. adapting for gauge covariance, we then dene gauge-
covariantly quartoid superelds:

1. chiral lefton :

2. antichiral lefton :

3. chiral righton :

4. antichiral righton :

(+ r ) = ( r ) = ( r) = 0 ,
(+ r ) = ( r) = ( r) = 0 ,
( l ) = (+ l) = (+ l ) = 0 ,
( l) = (+ l) = (+ l ) = 0 .

(3.12a)

(3.12b)

(3.12c)

(3.12d)

notice that all of these may be regarded as gauge-covariantly chiral superelds (or their
hermitian conjugates) which so happen to satisfy an additional gauge-covariant supercon-
straint.

all of these being (anti)chiral, they must have no charges with respect to the gauge
groups generated by the b, cs and their conjugates. however, each gauge-covariantly
quartoid supereld obeys an additional constraint, which then implies that the a-charges
must be zero too. for example, a chiral lefton satises both the constraints of a chiral
supereld, and those of a twisted-antichiral supereld. the former preclude coupling to
all but the type-a gauge superelds, while the latter precludes even that.

3.3. non-minimal gauge-covariantly haploid superelds

unlike the highly selective coupling of the minimal gauge-covariantly haploid superelds
to the various gauge (super)elds as displayed in table 1, non-minimal gauge-covariantly
haploid superelds couple universally [10] !

 12 

adapting from ref. [1], we recall the denitions of the non-minimal (second-order

constrained) gauge-covariantly haploid superelds:

1. nm-chiral :

2. nm-antichiral :

3. nm-twisted-chiral :

4. nm-twisted-antichiral :

5. nm-(almost)-lefton :

6. nm-(almost)-righton :

(cid:0)[+, ] (cid:1) = 0 ,
(cid:0)[, +] (cid:1) = 0 ,
(cid:0)[+, ] (cid:1) = 0 ,
(cid:0)[, +] (cid:1) = 0 ,
(cid:0)[, ] a(cid:1) = 0 ,
(cid:0)[+, +] u(cid:1) = 0 .

(3.13a)

(3.13b)

(3.13c)

(3.13d)

(3.13e)

(3.13f)

it is absolutely essential to realize that the quadratic superderivatives in these dening
constraints must be commutators, as thisand not the anticommutatorhas the correct
vanishing coupling limit: when ,   d, d, the symmetric products of the superderiva-
tives vanish identically, except for eqs. (1.5).

it is indeed a trivial observationantisymmetric and symmetric products being lin-
early independentthat eqs. (3.13) imply no exclusion on the minimal coupling type
interaction between any of the a, b, c and their conjugates to any of the , , a, u and
their conjugates. so, although in the massless free-eld limit the physical component
elds of non-minimal superelds occur in a 11 correspondence with those of the minimal
ones (see p.200 of ref. [6]), their diering couplings to the minimal coupling gauge (su-
per)elds as dened in eqs. (2.1) prove the physical inequivalence of the minimal haploid
superelds (3.1) from their non-minimal brethren (3.13) [10].

similarly, the peculiar inhomogeneous (gauge) transformation which enables the
minimal/non-minimal 11 identication even without a choice of the lagrangian density [1]
is manifestly broken 8) by the couplings to the gauge (super)elds dened in eqs. (2.1).
after all, what really matters in nontrivial physics models are the types of interactions
the various involved (super)elds can have.



unlike the n =1 supersymmetric 3+1-dimensional spacetime, (2, 2)-supersymmetric
1+1-dimensional spacetime admits dierent types of symmetry gauging, and gauge-
covariantly constrained superelds which represent:

1. matter with no minimal-coupling gauge interaction: gauge-covariantly quartoid su-

perelds (3.12);

2. matter with highly selective minimal-coupling gauge interactions: minimal gauge-

covariantly haploid superelds (3.1)  see table 1;

3. matter with universal minimal-coupling gauge interactions: non-minimal gauge-

covariantly quartoid superelds (3.13).

8) the denitions of the non-minimal gauge-covariantly haploid superelds (3.13) are invariant
under this peculiar inhomogeneous (gauge) transformation only in the limit of no gauge coupling.

 13 

note that the above discussion focuses on the so-called minimal coupling, wherein
the gauge (super)elds enter as connection superelds, through the modication of the
(super)derivative, i.e., (super)momentum operator (2.1). additional types of symmetry
gauging are possible through introduction of pauli-terms or other higher-derivative terms;
their study is left to the interested reader.

4. special symmetry gauging types

with the consistency of the modications (2.11) established, and the resulting con-
straints (2.14), (2.15), and relations (2.12), (2.16) and (2.17) in hand, we now seek in-
teresting special cases.

the selectivity of couplings between gauge-covariantly haploid superelds and various
gauge potentials shown in table 1 suggests the following simplication. assume that the
gauge group is of the form g = gagbg=g=| , and let the gauge potentials a, b, c=, c=|
each take values in the generators of the accordingly named factor. it is then possible to
project on any one direct product factor, eectively setting the generators (charges) of
all other factors to zero. this annihilates every (super)eld valued only in the generators
of the complementary factor of the gauge group. therefore, projecting on a factor is
equivalent to setting all (super)elds valued in the complementary factor to zero, and this
is how we proceed.

4.1. type-a gauging

let us rst project on the ga factor in the gauge group, i.e., set b = 0 = c. the peculiar
relations (2.15) now imply that

[, a] = 0 = [+, a] ,

and [, a] = 0 = [+, a] .

(4.1)

that is, a is gauge-covariantly twisted-chiral and a gauge-covariantly twisted-antichiral.
reassuringly, the conclusion of eqs. (3.6) does not apply here. that is, eqs. (3.6) notwith-
standing, eqs. (4.1) do not imply that a must itself be chargeless with respect to gauge
group it generates which would preclude type-a gauging of nonabelian groups. repeating
the calculation of eqs. (3.6), however with   a, we now obtain

0 != [a, a] = iajakfjk

(4.2)

ltl ,
l = fkj

l and the commutivity of the
which vanishes on account of the antisymmetry fjk
ajs. this allows a to have nonzero ga-charges, as is indeed necessary when the gauge
group ga is nonabelian.

supereld strengths
the formulae (2.12) and (2.17) simplify:

w =  i
w =  i

2 [, a] , w+ = i
2 [, a] , w+ = i

2 [+, a] ,
2 [+, a] ,

 14 

(4.3a)

(4.3b)

and f = e(f ), with

(4.3c)

4(cid:0)[, +]a(cid:1) ,
and the w, w| and their conjugates vanish. the jacobi identities involving two spinorial
and one vectorial  then produce the familiar relations:

f = i

{, w} = 0 ,
{, w} = 0 ,

{+, w} = 0 ,
{+, w} = 0 ,

(4.4a)

(4.4b)

proving that w are gauge-covariantly chiral and w are gauge-covariantly antichiral,
related by the bisection formula (2.16d)just as in n =1 supersymmetric 3+1-dimensional
spacetime theories.

we will refer to {a, a; w, w; f}, subject to the superdierential relations (4.3), as
the type-a, or twisted gauge multiplet, since the gauge potential superelds a are gauge-
covariantly twisted-chiral. notice however that the spinorial gauge eld strength superelds
w are gauge-covariantly chiral. recall also that these gauge elds do not couple to
gauge-covariantly twisted-chiral matter superelds and their conjugates (3.1c, d).

dimensional reduction
the type-a gauge supermultiplet, {a, a; w, w; f}, was called vm-i in ref. [4] and
was identied there with the gauge supermultiplet obtained by dimensional reduction from
n =1 supersymmetric 3+1-dimensional spacetime. recall that all eld strength superelds
with two fermionic indices are conventionally set to zero to prevent the duplication of gauge
eld degrees of freedom per gauge symmetry (see p.171172 of ref. [6]). appearances to
the contrary, this is not violated by the inclusion of a, a on the r.h.s. of eqs. (2.11a).

to see this, consider the 1+1-dimensional spacetime (world-sheet) embedded in a 3+1-
dimensional one. let =, =| be locally tangent to the world-sheet, and j = j  ij,
with j = 2, 3, be transversal to it. dimensional reduction then implies that all (super)elds
are set to be annihilated by j, whereupon j  ij . finally, since

{d, d} = 2i(2  i3) ,

(4.5)

a comparison with eqs. (2.11a) sets a = 2(2+i3). so, the superelds a, which are
scalars in the 1+1-dimensional sense, are in fact a linear combination of the transversal
components of the gauge 3+1-vector potential superelds. also, although a, a are gauge-
covariant (being dened as the anticommutator of gauge-covariant superderivatives), they
are identied as gauge potential superelds, and not as (super)eld strengths.

furthermore, although a, a, w, w, f are separate (2,2)-superelds related through
the superdierential equations (4.3), it is convenient to regard them as jointly forming a
gauge supereld multiplet. finally, the a, a are thus seen to be rightly regarded as gauge
potential superelds, which determine the eld strength superelds through eqs. (4.3).

abelian case
a further simplication is easy to demonstrate when ga is abelian, so that a are ga-
chargeless, being lie-algebra valued, i.e., in the adjoint representation of ga. thuswhile

 15 

acting on a, athe ga-covariant (super)derivatives in eqs. (4.1) act as ordinary (su-
per)derivatives (1.4), a and a become plain twisted-chiral and twisted-antichiral super-
elds. these are then easily expressed in terms of an unconstrained, prepotential supereld:

this produces

and

and a =(cid:0)[d, d+] v(a)(cid:1) .
a =(cid:0)[d+, d] v(a)(cid:1) ,
8(cid:16)[d, d+][d+, d]v(a) + [d, d+][d, d+]v(a)(cid:17) ,
2(cid:0)ddd+d+v(a)  ddd+d+v(a)(cid:1) ,

= i

f = i

w = i(cid:0)d+dd v(a)(cid:1) , w+ = i(cid:0)d+dd+ v(a)(cid:1) ,
w = i(cid:0)dd+d v(a)(cid:1) , w+ = i(cid:0)dd+d+ v(a)(cid:1) ,

which are consistent 9) with

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8a)

(4.8b)

(4.9)

(4.7)

(4.10)

 = i(dv(a)) ,
+ = i(d+v(a)) ,

 = i(dv(a)) ,
+ = i(d+v(a)) .

finally, we must ensure that b, b do vanish as assumed. to this end, substituting
eqs. (4.9) into (2.18a, b), we see that v(a) = v(a) must be ensured, and no further re-
strictions transpire from the remaining equations (2.18). this reproduces the well-known
reality of the gauge vector prepotential supereld, v. after a little d-algebra, we also
obtain

where

f = 2(=| v(a)

so that the lowest component of f in (4.7) is the usual (abelian) yang-mills eld strength,
in terms of the 2-vector potential obtained as the lowest components of v(a)

.

= , v(a)

4.2. type-b gauging

let us next project on the gb factor in the gauge group, i.e., set a = 0 = c. the peculiar
relations (2.14) now imply that

[, b] = 0 ,

and [, b] = 0 .

(4.11)

that is, b is gauge-covariantly chiral and b gauge-covariantly antichiral. again, the
conclusion of eqs. (3.5) does not apply here. repeating the calculation of eqs. (3.5), with
  b, we obtain

0 != [b, b] = ibj bkfjk

ltl ,

(4.12)

9) unlike f and the ws, the s transform inhomogeneously under gauge transformations, and

so remain dened only up to additive terms stemming from this.

 16 

which again vanishes on account of the antisymmetry of the fjk
the bjs, allowing b to have nonzero gb-charges.

ls and the commutivity of

supereld strengths
the formulae (2.12) and (2.17) again simplify:

f = i

2 [, b] ,
4(cid:0)[, +]b(cid:1) ,

(4.13a)

(4.13b)

w =  i

2 [, b] , w =  i

f = e(f ) ,

and w, w| and their conjugates vanish. the jacobi identities involving two spinorial
and one vectorial  then produce the mirror of the familiar relations (4.4):

and

{, w+} = 0 ,
{, w} = 0 ,

{+, w+} = 0 ,
{+, w} = 0 ,

{, w} = 0 ,
{, w+} = 0 ,

{+, w} = 0 ,
{+, w+} = 0 ,

(4.14a)

(4.14b)

(4.14c)

(4.14d)

proving that now w+, w are gauge-covariantly twisted-chiral and w, w+ are gauge-
covariantly twisted-antichiral, again related by the bisection formula (2.16d). the abelian
version of this type-b gauge multiplet was labeled vm-ii in ref. [4] and was identied
as the mirror of the usual vector multiplet. notice that now the spinorial eld strength
superelds w+, w are gauge-covariantly twisted-chiral, while the gauge potentials b are
gauge-covariantly chiral.

we will refer to {b, b; w, w; f}, subject to the superdierential relations (4.13),
as the type-b or chiral gauge multiplet. recall that these gauge elds do not couple to
gauge-covariantly chiral superelds and their conjugates (3.1a, b).

dimensional reduction
the type-b gauge supermultiplet, {b, b; w, w; f}, was called vm-ii and identied
with the mirror-twisted cousin of the type-a gauge supereld multiplet [4]. this gauge
multiplet has no counterpart in the rather more familiar 3+1-dimensional models, where
the anticommutator of any two (un)conjugate gauge-covariant superderivatives vanishes.
however, one may regard the superelds b as the gauge potential supereld intro-
duced to covariantize the (spin-0) central chargeswere such to have been introduced in
further generalizing the gauge-covariant supersymmetry algebra (2.11). that the present
case (2.11) contains no such central charges may be understood merely as the statement
that all involved superelds are chargeless with respect to these central charges.

abelian case
again, a further simplication is easy to demonstrate when gb is abelian, so that b are
gb-chargeless. againwhile acting on the b, bthe gb-covariant (super)derivatives in

 17 

eqs. (4.11) act as ordinary (super)derivatives (1.4), b and b become plain chiral and
antichiral superelds, and so can be expressed in terms of an unconstrained prepotential
supereld:

easily then,

and b =(cid:0)[d, d+] v(b)(cid:1) .
b =(cid:0)[d+, d] v(b)(cid:1) ,
8(cid:16)[d, d+][d+, d]v(b)} + [dd+][d, d+]v(b)(cid:9)(cid:17) ,
2(cid:0)ddd+d+v(b)  ddd+d+v(b)(cid:1) ,

= i

f = i

w = i(cid:0)dd+d v(b)(cid:1) , w = i(cid:0)ddd+ v(b)(cid:1) ,

and

which are consistent with

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.16)

(4.19)

 = i(dv(b)) ,

and  = i(dv(b)) .

again, to ensure that a, a do vanish as assumed, substitute eqs. (4.18) into (2.18c, d),
to show that v(b) = v(b); no further restrictions transpire from the remaining equa-
tions (2.18). so, the mirror of the gauge vector prepotential supereld, v, must also be
real. after a little d-algebra, this produces

where

v(b)

so that the lowest component of f in (4.16) is the usual (abelian) yang-mills eld strength,
in terms of the 2-vector potential obtained as the lowest components of v(b)

.

4.3. type-c= gauging

let us project on the g= factor in the gauge group, i.e., set b = a = 0 = c=| . the
peculiar relations (2.14) and (2.15) now imply that

[+, c=] = 0 ,
[+, c=] = 0 ,

[+, c=] = 0 ,
[+, c=] = 0 ,

while eqs. (2.13) further constrain

[, c=] = 0 ,

and [, c=] = 0 .

(4.20)

(4.21)

that is, c=s are gauge-covariantly chiral rightons (3.12c), while c=s are gauge-
covariantly antichiral rightons (3.12d); in fact, they are gauge-covariantly quartoid super-
elds. that is, they (eectively) depend on only one quarter of the four supercoordinates,
,   [1].

 18 

as with the bs and the as, the conclusion of  3.1 on the high selectivity of gauge
couplings does not apply to the c=s themselves. in fact, we nd that the c= do couple
to the g=-gauge superelds, since

0 != [c=, c=] = ici

=cj
ks and the commutivity of the cs. this
vanishes on account of the antisymmetry of the fij
allows c= and its conjugate to have nonzero g=-charges, as is necessary for nonabelian
g=.

supereld strengths

again, the formulae (2.12) and (2.17) simplify:

w =  i

2 [, c=] , w =  i

2 [, c=] ,

(4.23)

and w| , w, their conjugates and f all vanish. recall that the would-be usual bosonic
eld strength, f=,=, vanishes identically; see appendix b. the jacobi identities involving
two spinorial and one vectorial  then produce the analogue of the familiar relations (4.4):
(4.24b)

{+, w} = 0 ,
{+, w} = 0 ,

{+, w} = 0 ,
{+, w} = 0 ,

(4.24a)

proving that w, w are covariant rightons, related by the bisection formula (2.16e).
in fact, since

2i{, w} =(cid:8), [, c=](cid:9) = 1

2(cid:2)c=, {, }(cid:3) = [c=, c=] ,

the w are gauge-covariantly antichiral rightons if g= is abelian. of course, the w then
are gauge-covariantly chiral rightons.

(4.25)

we will refer to {c=, c=; w, w}, subject to the superdierential relations (4.23),
as the type-c=, or chiral righton gauge multiplet. these gauge elds only couple to
covariant rightons (3.1f), and to all non-minimal haploid superelds (3.13).

dimensional reduction
the chiral righton gauge multiplet {c=, c=; w, w} also has no counterpart in the
rather more familiar 3+1-dimensional models. somewhat in analogy with the b, b poten-
tial superelds, the spin-1 gauge potential superelds c=, c= also may be regarded as the
gauge potentials introduced to covariantize the (now spin-1) central chargeswere such to
have been introduced on the r.h.s. of rst of eqs. (2.11c). again, their absence from the
present case (2.11) may be understood merely as the statement that all involved supereld
are chargeless with respect to these central charges.

abelian case
again, c=, c= are g=-chargeless, and the g=-gauge covariant (super)derivatives act on
the c=, c= as ordinary (super)derivatives do. now, as noted in ref. [1], it is not possible
to express chiral rightons, and so also the c=, c=s, in terms of a superderivative of

 19 

it is possible, however, to write c=

def= (dc), thereby
an ambidextrous supereld.
specifying the g=-gauge potential in terms of a spin- 1
2 righton prepotential supereld, c.
since now eqs. (2.18e) imply that c= = i(d), it follows that the half of 
which is not annihilated by d must be equal to the analogous half of ic. in the same
fashion, the half of  which is not annihilated by d must be equal to the analogous half
of ic. the complementary halves of these respective superelds remain unrelated. of
course, now + = 0 = +. thus, unlike in the type-a and type-b gauging, the type-c=
gauge superelds ,  are not completely determined by the prepotential superelds
c, c, and their introduction is less useful.
4.4. type-c=| gauging
finally, let us project on the g=| factor in the gauge group, i.e., set b = a = 0 = c=.
the peculiar relations (2.14) and (2.15) now imply that

[, c=| ] = 0 ,
[, c=| ] = 0 ,

[, c=| ] = 0 ,
[, c=| ] = 0 ,

(4.26)

 20 

the w| are gauge-covariantly antichiral leftons if g=| is abelian. of course, the w| then
are gauge-covariantly chiral leftons.

we will refer to {c=| , c=| ; w| , w| }, subject to the superdierential relations (4.29),
as the type-c=| , or chiral lefton gauge multiplet. these gauge elds only couple to covariant
leftons (3.1e), and to all non-minimal haploid superelds (3.13).

dimensional reduction
the chiral lefton gauge multiplet {c=| , c=| ; w| , w| } also has no counterpart in the
rather more familiar 3+1-dimensional models. somewhat in analogy with the b, b and
c=, c= potential superelds, the spin-(1) gauge potential superelds c=| , c=| also may
be regarded as the gauge potentials introduced to covariantize the spin-(1) central
chargeswere such to have been introduced on the r.h.s. of second of eqs. (2.11c). again,
their absence from the present case (2.11) may be understood merely as the statement
that all involved supereld are chargeless with respect to these central charges.

abelian case
again, c=| , c=| are g=| -chargeless, and the g=| -gauge covariant (super)derivatives act on
the c=| , c=| as ordinary (super)derivatives do. now, as noted in ref. [1], it is not possible
to express chiral leftons, and so also the c=| , c=| s, in terms of a superderivative of an am-
def= (d+c+), thereby specifying
bidextrous supereld. it is possible, however, to write c=|
the g=| -gauge potential in terms of a spin-( 1

2 ) lefton prepotential supereld, c+.

since now eqs. (2.18f) imply that c=| = i(d++), it follows that the half of +
which is not annihilated by d+ must be equal to the analogous half of ic+. in the same
fashion, the half of + which is not annihilated by d must be equal to the analogous
half of ic+. the complementary halves of these respective superelds remain unrelated.
of course, this time  = 0 = . again, unlike in the type-a and type-b gauging and
just like in the type-c= gauging, the type-c=| gauge superelds +, + are not completely
determined by the prepotential superelds c+, c+.



thus, for type-a and type-b gauging, both the spinorial eld strength superelds,
w, w, and the potential superelds, a, a, b, b, are gauge-covariantly haploid superelds,
and of relatively twisted chirality: if the gauge potentials are (anti)chiral, the spinorial eld
strengths are twisted (anti)chiral, and vice versa. for both type-c gaugings, however, the
spinorial eld strengths, w, w, are gauge-covariantly unidexterous haploid superelds,
whereas the gauge potentials, c, c, are gauge-covariantly quartoid superelds.

similarly, there are marked dierences in the abelian case. while the type-a and
type-b gauging of an abelian symmetry both allow a straightforward reduction of all gauge
superelds to a real gauge prepotential supereld, this is not the case in the two type-c
gauging. here, only a pair of spinorial gauge prepotential superelds, c, c and c+, c+,
can be introduced as easily, but they do not determine completely the gauge superelds
, , and so are of limited use. also, while the spinorial eld strengths for type-a and

 21 

type-b gauging remain gauge-covariantly haploid superelds, those for the two type-c
gaugings become gauge-covariantly quartoid superelds.

finally, unlike the type-a and type-b gauging, neither of the type-c gaugings con-

tributes to the usual yang-mills eld strength supereld, f.

4.5. mixed type gauging

the previous simple cases, when all but one (and its conjugate) of the a, b, c=, c=| gauge
superelds is zero, represent the most restricted type of symmetry gauging.

it is also possible to have only some two, or only some three, or indeed all four of the
a, b, c=, c=| s valued in the generators of the same irreducible factor of the total gauge
group. thus, the most general type of gauge symmetry is, in principle, of the form of a
direct product of 15 factors:

ggen = (cid:16)oi

gi(cid:17) ,

(4.32)

where i is a multi-index, taking values in 1,- 2,- 3- and 4-element subsets of the label-set
{a, b, =, =|}. tj , the generators of ggen then have a block-diagonal matrix representation,
such that the matrix-generators of the nth factor in (4.32) have only the nth diagonal block
non-zero. normalizing these generators so that

we easily dene projectors on any one of the 15 factors in (4.32):

tr(cid:8) tj , tk(cid:9) = jk ,

pi (x) def= xji

tj tr(cid:8) tj , x(cid:9) ,

(4.33)

(4.34)

where x is an arbitrary supereld, assumed only to be expandable over the generators of
ggen: x = tkx k. clearly then,
pi (x) = xji

tj tr(cid:8)tj , tk(cid:9)x k = (cid:26) x if k  i,

if k 6= i.

(4.35)

0

the a, a gauge potential superelds are expanded over the generators of

ggen(cid:12)(cid:12)a = oia

pi(cid:0)ggen(cid:1) ,

(4.36)

= ga  gab  ga=  ga=|  gab=  gab=|  ga==|  gab==| ,

and so on. the properties of the mixed gauging types can be deduced from the above
analysis of the pure gauging types, and shortly we turn to a few sample cases.

before that, however, a general remark is in order: all the mixed types of gaug-
ing are beset with a common property. as now more than one of the gauge superelds
a, b, c=, c=| is non-zero, there will occur a duplication of degrees of freedom per gauge
transformation. this is against standard wisdom (see ref. [6], p. 170), but need not be

 22 

deleterious in 1+1-dimensional spacetime. we will comment on this below, but defer a
detailed study for a later time.

type-ab gauging
an example of this mixed kind is provided by the gauge group which is denoted by gab
in (4.32). projecting the (total) gauge group to this factor, we obtain c = 0, but a, b 6= 0.
in this case, the spin- 1
2 supereld strengths are as given in eqs. (2.12) and they obey
the bisection formula (2.16d), but the spin- 3
2 supereld strengths given in eqs. (2.12)
vanish. the bosonic supereld strength, f, is as given in eq. (2.16c). since the cs vanish,
so do the right hand sides of the peculiar relations (2.14) and (2.15), so that the gauge
potential superelds a, b are twisted-chiral and chiral, respectively, just as in the simple
cases of  4.1 and 4.2.

reviewing the selectivity of coupling to matter (table 1), it should be clear that
gab couples neither to chiral nor to twisted-chiral superelds (or their conjugates), but it
can couple to leftons (3.1e) and rightons (3.1f ), and of course to all non-minimal haploid
superelds (3.13).

the two non-zero gauge superelds, a, b, now provide two independent complex
gauge scalars, a, b, and four independent gauginos, , a+, ; see below. doubling the
physical degrees of freedom assigned to each gauge transformation, this will denitely
lead to incorrect (redundant) interaction with matter. the similar duplication of the
independent contributions into the bosonic eld strength, f, is less alarming, as it is an
auxiliary eld in 1+1-dimensions.

the gauge symmetry in this context may be identied as the diagonal subgroup
gab  (ga  gb), where of course ga  gb. a properly non-redundant gauging would
then imply an identication of the type-a gauge elds with the type-b ones, and in a su-
persymmetric manner. to this end, one has to impose additional (super)constraints. this
approach however often has unexpected and undesired consequences [1]: [+, a]=[+, b],
i.e.,
for example,
=| a = 0 = =| b! in the nonabelian case this would also produce non-linear relationships
between the component elds of a, b. whether or not this redundancy of physically rel-
evant gauge degrees of freedom can be eliminated in a manifestly supersymmetric fashion
then remains an open question for now.

induces both a and b to become gauge-covariantly right-moving,

type-ac= gauging
another example of this mixed kind is provided by the gauge group ga=: here b, c=| = 0,
but a, c= 6= 0. this time, the spin- 1
2 supereld strengths are as given in eqs. (4.3a, b)
and they obey the bisection formula (2.16d); the nonzero spin- 3
2 supereld strengths
are as given in eqs. (4.23). the bosonic supereld strength, f, is as given in eq. (4.3c).
the gauge potential superelds a are no longer twisted-chiral, but instead satisfy only the
single constraint, [+, a]=0, and are related to c= through the curious relation (2.14a):
[, a] = [+, c=]. a combination of the remaining curious relations (2.14), (2.15)
and the constraints (2.13) imply that c= now is chiral.

 23 

reviewing again the selectivity of coupling to matter (table 1), it should be clear that
ga= again couples neither to chiral nor to twisted-chiral superelds (or their conjugates),
but it can couple to leftons (3.1e), rightons (3.1f), and of course to all non-minimal haploid
superelds (3.13).

as compared to the type-a gauging, the gauge superelds a, c= now contribute
additional spin-(1, 3
2 ) degrees of freedom, none of which are physical. they do however
complicate the auxiliary eld structure of any model where this type of gauging is employed.
in the quantum theory, these additional, higher-spin component elds will also induce the
appearance of additional ghost degrees of freedom as compared to the type-a gauging. it is
possible that this leads to essentially and usefully dierent dynamics, much as non-minimal
haploid and minimal haploid superelds are physically inequivalent [10]. a denite answer
to this question will however require a study of its own.

universal, i.e., type-abc gauging
our nal example of this mixed kind is provided by theuniversal gauge group gab==| :
here all of a, b, cs are nonzero, and valued in the same irreducible lie algebra. this is
in fact the general case considered in  2, and no modication is needed.

the selectivity of coupling to matter (table 1) now implies that gab==| couples to
none of the gauge-covariantly haploid superelds, but of course can couple to all of the non-
minimal haploid superelds (3.13). this yet again reinforces the distinction between min-
imal gauge-covariantly haploid superelds (3.1), and their non-minimal brethren (3.13).

clearly, the issue of duplication of physical degrees of freedom becomes most compli-
cated here, and it combines the kind found in the type-ab and the type-ac= gaugings.
whether or not a suitable non-redundant gauging of this type is possible remains an open
question for now.

4.6. gauge transformation

the gauge transformation operator, g, which appears in eqs. (2.2), has so far remained
unspecied. in general, of course, g = exp(ie), where e is a (4.32)-lie algebra valued
supereld, i.e., a supereld expanded over the generators of ggen in (4.32). notice that
the denitions of the constrained superelds (3.1), (3.12) and (3.13) are all covariant with
respect to the gauge transformation (2.2)regardless of the supereld type of e ! for
example, e may be chosen to be an unconstrained supereld, yet the transformed gauge-
covariantly chiral supereld (3.1a),  def= g satises the transformed covariant chirality
condition,

() = 0



(

) def= (gg1g) = g() = 0 .

(4.37)

the same applies to all other superconstraints (3.1), (3.12) and (3.13). note that as the
gauge transformation operator, g, is required to be unitary, the gauge transformation
generator, e, must be hermitian. other that that, however, e remains an unconstrained
general supereld.

 24 

depending on the choice of supereld type for e, there exist several distinct repre-

sentations [6], and we now discuss some of them in turn.

chiral representation
the innitesimal version of  def= g reads

and the innitesimal version of (2.9) becomes

 = ie ,

the innitesimal transformation of, say, the chirality condition (3.1a) becomes

 = (de)  i[, e] = e ,
 = (de)  i[, e] = e .
( ) = (cid:0)()(cid:1) + (cid:0)(cid:0))(cid:1) .

(4.38)

(4.39)

(4.40)

now, since  = i and  = ie, we have that for a gauge-covariantly chiral
supereld to remain so, it must be that

whereupon

in agreement with (4.39).

i  +  ie = 0 ,

 = e ,

and  = e ,

(4.41)

(4.42)

frequently, however, one encounters a weaker notion of preserving the type of con-
strained superelds. in comparison to the preceding argument, let us regard the variation
of the conjugate gauge superelds, , as being of higher order. that is, the gauge param-
eter e is now chosen to be a slowly varying supereld, so that e  e, and   0. in
this limit, the condition (4.41) for a gauge-covariantly chiral supereld to remain so may
be stated as

e = 0 ,

(4.43)



i.e., that e is a gauge-covariantly chiral supereld itself, and with respect to the untrans-
formed covariant derivative. this necessarily contradicts the originally required hermiticity
of e, and so the unitarity of g. for, if e was also hermitian, then the hermitian conjugate
of (4.43) would imply



e = 

e = 0 ,

(4.44)

whereupon = e = 0 = =|
e, and e would have to be gauge-covariantly constant. note
that this does not necessarily imply absolute constancy; nevertheless, this is often consid-
ered as too restrictive a choice. one hence leaves e to be complex and chiral, and so the
gauge transformation operator g

def= exp{i e} is no longer unitary.

this complicates things, since now g1 6= g, and expressions such as tr(),
tr(4)|, etc. are no longer gauge-invariant. the remedy (see, e.g., ref. [9],  3.6.4)

 25 

involves the introduction of two distinct covariant derivatives, (), such that ((+))
and (()) transform covariantly:
((+)) = g((+)) ,

and (()) = (())( g1) .

(4.45)

we will return to this issue below.

this is the simplest choice, in that eq. (4.38) maintains chirality in this weaker, but
more familiar sense: gauge-covariantly chiral supereld form a ring, and are in particular
closed under multiplicationa product of two gauge-covariantly chiral superelds is again
gauge-covariantly chiral. note that this implies that, in this (chiral) representation,

 = (

e) ,

and  = (

e) = 0 ,

(4.42)

which is rather asymmetric [6]. in the antichiral representation, e of course obeys (3.1b),
and the asymmetry of (4.42) is reversed.

other representations

in which e
it is of course equally easy to choose a twisted-chiral representation,
obeys (3.1c), and is suitable for transforming twisted-chiral superelds. similarly, in the
lefton representation, e is chosen to obey (3.1e) and is suitable for transforming leftons,
and in the righton representation, e is required to obey (3.1f) and is suitable for trans-
forming rightons. in each of these case, one uses the closure under multiplication of the
minimal haploid superelds (3.1):

for any two superelds which both satisfy any one of the pairs of
simple, rst order superdierential constraints (3.1), so does any
analytic function thereof, and in particular, so does their product.

by contrast, non-minimal haploid superelds (3.13) are not closed under multiplication:

for any two superelds which both satisfy any one of the simple,
second order superdierential constraints (3.13), only their linear
combinations satisfy the same superconstraint.

however, since all minimal gauge-covariantly haploid superelds (3.1) also satisfy the
non-minimal gauge-covariantly haploid superconstraints (3.13), there does exist a choice
of e which preserves the type of the non-minimal gauge-covariantly haploid super-
if the gauge parameter supereld e is chosen to be a minimal gauge-
elds (3.13).
covariantly haploid supereld, its product with the corresponding non-minimal gauge-
covariantly haploid remains a non-minimal gauge-covariantly haploid.

for example, if e obeys (3.1a) while  obeys (3.13a), then ei e  also obeys (3.13a),
and so does  = i e. thus, any one of the minimal haploid representations of the gauge
transformation may also be used for the corresponding non-minimal haploid superelds,
and their superconstraint will remain preserved also in the weaker sense (4.43).

 26 

4.7. non-unitary (de)covariantization and gauge prepotentials

on physical grounds, the covariantization d  , as done in eqs. (2.1), relates the
(super)derivatives with their gauge-covariant counterparts in a continuous fashion. indeed,
the (suppressed) coupling constant may be continuously turned o to recover   d. this
operation resembles the gauge transformation process, and it is indeed possible [6,9] to nd
operators, h, such that

 = h1dh ,

and  =  

 = hdh1 .

(4.46)

it should be clear that h must not be unitary: if it were, there would always have to exist
a gauge in which   d, and where all the gauge elds  would vanishcontradicting the
fact that (at least some) gauge elds are physically relevant. as it is, h may be written
as the exponential with a complex exponent, the imaginary part of which can always be
annihilated by a suitable (unitary) gauge transformation, g = eie , where e = e. in this
gauge then, h is hermitian, being an exponential with a hermitian exponent: h = ev ,
where v = v so also hh = h.

note that the non-unitary transformation (4.46) induces a corresponding transforma-
tion on superelds. for example, the gauge-covariantly chiral superelds satisfy eq. (3.1a),
which now becomes

0 =  = hdh1 .

this prompts the denitions

where now (0) ((0)) is simply 10) (anti)chiral:

 = h(0) ,

and so  = (0)h ,

d(0) = 0 ,

and d(0) = 0 .

(4.47)

(4.48)

(4.49)

using the non-unitary transformation (4.46) and (4.48), it is then always possible to
rewrite a model involving gauge-covariantly (anti)chiral superelds, , , coupled to gauge
(super)elds in terms of the simply (anti)chiral superelds, (0), (0), coupled to the same
gauge (super)elds. for example,

tr(cid:0)(cid:1) = tr(cid:0)h(0)(0)h(cid:1) = tr(cid:0)(0)hh(0)(cid:1) .

furthermore, upon the gauge transformation described above in which h = ev is her-
mitian, we have

(4.50)

(4.51)

tr(cid:0)(cid:1) = tr(cid:0)(0) e2v (0)(cid:1) ,

which recovers (upon 4-fermionic integration) the standard expressions for the gauge-
covariant kinetic term in the lagrangian for (anti)chiral superelds [6,7,8,9]. moreover,
this shows the origin of the gauge (pre)potential supereld, v, as the generator of the
coset gc/g, where gc denotes the complexication of the gauge group g. that is, having
relaxed unitarity, h is an element of gc; but, when taken modulo gauge transformations
(which live in g), h belongs to the coset gc/g. indeed, this v becomes the gauge pre-
potential v(a), as found in eqs. (4.6) for the abelian case of type-a gauging, and v(b),

10) non-gauge-covariantly . . . being such a clumsy mouthful, we write simply . . . instead.

 27 

as found in eqs. (4.15) for the abelian case of type-b gauging. see  3.6 of ref. [9] for the
derivation of the analogous statement from the standard (but opposite to our) approach,
where one employs the simple (super)derivatives and simply constrained superelds but
inserts explicitly gauge-covariantizing factors such as e2v .

in the present approach, gauge-covariance is made manifest through the use of
gauge-covariant derivatives (2.1) and gauge-covariantly constrained superelds (3.1), (3.12)
and (3.13). with the present level of generality, this seems preferable to determining the
precise form of all the gauge-covariantizing insertions separately. instead, the analogues
of e2v for other simply haploid superelds may be obtained by applying to the above
results: (1) either of the (mirror map) discrete transformations, c, of ref. [1] for twisted-
(anti)chiral superelds, and (2) either of q, q of ref. [1] to map (anti)chiral superelds into
leftons (rightons). we leave this to the interested reader.

we do note, however, that the appearance of the prepotential supereld, v, in ex-
pressions like (4.51) proves its existence and uncovers its geometric origins, for all types of
symmetry gauging and all (compact) symmetry groupsnot just the abelian cases shown
explicitly in  4. a more complete discussion of such decovariantization(s) is presented
elsewhere [11].

5. component eld content

the denition of component elds by means of projecting on the various terms in the
taylor expansion [6,9,1] is easy to adapt for the presence of gauge symmetries. one simply
uses covariant superderivatives (2.1) in place of ordinary ones (1.4), and commutators for
second order superderivatives. as usual, | will denote setting  = 0 =  .

5.1. matter elds and general convention

(5.1f)

are the component elds in the gauge-covariantly lefton and the gauge-covariantly righton
superelds. we write  = (; +, +; l=| ) and  = (r; , ; r=).

since gauge-covariantly quartoid superelds cannot couple to any of the minimally
coupled gauge (super)elds, the denitions of their component elds remain as given in
ref. [1].

the component eld content of the non-minimal haploid superelds is just as
straightforward to obtain, only this time there are more component elds than in eqs. (5.1).
for example,

the component elds of  and  are then obtained by hermitian conjugation. we write

the components of the non-minimal gauge-covariantly (almost) lefton (3.13e) and (al-
most) righton (3.13f) can be dened as easily. however, to avoid confusion with the gauge
potential supereld a and since we will not need these (almost) unidexterous superelds,
we leave the denition of the components of the non-minimal gauge-covariantly (almost)
lefton (3.13e) and righton (3.13f) to the diligent reader.

the reader may nd it convenient to use the diagram in fig. 1 to nd the component eld
content of any supereld. all components are obtained by acting on the supereld with
one of the covariant operators from the diagram, and then setting =0= .

finally, throughout this article, we set the numerical coecients as in (5.1a):

for
2 for every commutator. the examples in (5.1) and (5.2) should

12

every superderivative, and 1
suce in clarifying this.

applying additional (super)derivatives merely produces total derivatives of the already
dened component elds. in this sense, the component elds, onto which the operators in
the diagram in fig. 1 project (upon setting =0= ), are considered independent.

5.3. gauge elds

as with any of the matter superelds in the preceding sections, the component elds of
the gauge superelds are also dened by applying the operators from the sequence in fig. 1,
and setting  = 0 =  s. bending somewhat the typographical conventions of ref. [1], we
list the component elds of the gauge superelds  as follows

and similarly for their conjugates. many of these component elds either do not even show
up in the lagrangian densities of interest, or they show up as auxiliary elds, i.e., such
that their equations of motion are algebraic, which allows for immediate elimination. until
however a lagrangian density is chosen for such an elimination to take place, one must
deal with all the component elds (5.3).

it is fairly standard in theories in 1+1-dimensional spacetime, to assign the coupling
constant, g, the canonical dimensions of =, =| , i.e., of a mass parameter. the lowest
components of the superelds =, =| , which through using eqs. (2.18i, j) become

then acquire the proper canonical dimension, 0, only upon the rescaling   g. this
makes it possible for the canonically rescaled superelds to appear in the standard, at
kinetic term

+ . . .

prior to the   g rescaling, such action terms ought to be premultiplied by g2.
through the   g rescaling, g, the lowest components of , , acquire the canonical
dimension  1
2 ; the (potentially) physical elds there being the gauge bosons , - and the
gauginos , -; the g, gs and the g stand for bosonic and fermionic auxiliary components.
essentially the same fate befalls the gauge potential superelds a, b, cs and their
conjugates (2.18a h). their lowest componentsthe gauge bosonsare linear combina-
tions of the , -s, and in the nonabelian case, of gg anticommutators. their next-to-
lowest componentsthe gauginosare linear combinations of the , -s and derivatives of
gs, and in the nonabelian case, of g commutators, and so on.

5.4. field strengths

since the gauge superelds  transform inhomogeneously under the gauge transforma-
tions (2.9)in the innitesimal form (4.42), so do their components. this means that the
gauge transformation parameter e may be chosen so as to gauge away some of the degrees
of component elds in . the wess-zumino gauge [6,7,8,9] is the best known such choice.

on the other hand, the eld strength superelds dened in eqs. (2.11) all transform
homogeneously, so that there exists no choice of the gauge parameter supereld, e, that
would gauge away a component eld of a, b, c. this then guarantees that all the
component elds of these superelds are unambiguously dened and independent of any
gauge choice.

furthermore, f is dened as a linear combination of gauge covariant superderiva-
tives of the ws, which in turn are all dened as gauge covariant superderivatives of the
a, b, cs. this guarantees that the lowest component eld of f is a linear combination of
the next-to-lowest component elds of the ws. and in turn, the lowest component elds
of the ws are linear combinations of the next-to-lowest component elds of the a, b, cs.

 31 

for this reason, all physically relevant (and unambiguously dened) component elds
in the gauge multiplets must be expressible in terms of the component elds of the a, b, c
and their conjugates. consequently, we leave to the interested reader the tracing of the
physical degrees of freedom in gauge multiplets all the way to the component elds of the
s and specication of the wess-zumino-like gauge(s) in which the remaining component
elds are annihilated. herein, we proceed instead to use the component elds of the
a, b, cs.

type-a gauge elds

in the simple type-a, -b and -c gauging, these latter superelds satisfy important su-
perconstraints (4.1), (4.11), (4.20) and (4.21), (4.26) and (4.27). thus, the independent
component elds of the type-a gauge multiplet can be specied equivalently either as
the component elds of the gauge-covariantly twisted-chiral supereld a, or as the lowest
component elds of the type-a gauge multiplet {a; w; f} given in  4.1 11):

a def= a| ,
def= 12

def= 12
a def= 1

a+

[, a]| = 2iw| ,
2iw+| ,
[+, a]| = 

4 [, +]a| = if| ,

[+, a]| = 2iw+| ,

a def= 1

4 [+, ]a| = i f| .

(5.5a)

(5.5b)

(5.5c)

(5.5d)

note the relative signs in the denition of the conjugate fermionic components; they stem
from the antisymmetry of the commutator. these are the spin-(0; 1
2 ;0) component elds of
the scalar gauge-covariantly twisted-chiral supereld a = (a; , a+; a) and its hermitian
conjugate, a = (a; , a+; a). the bosonic eld strength, f| then equals (the negative of)
the imaginary part of a:

the real part of a is easily shown to be the lowest component of the supereld

fa

def= f| = e(f )| = m(a) .

da

da

def= 1
2i{[, w+]}a = m(f ) ,
def= da| = m(f )| = e(a) .

(5.6)

(5.7)

where the subscript indicates projection on type-a gauge elds. clearly both f and da
are real. the lowest component of da is indeed, up to some conventional overall factor, the
familiar auxiliary d eld, descending by dimensional reduction from n =1 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory in 3+1-dimensions. this vindicates our use of the complex supereld f
as compared to using only its imaginary part, f.

in the present incarnation, the lowest components of f and da appear as the auxil-
iary components of the gauge-covariantly twisted-chiral supereld a. in particular, note

11) recall: ([, +]a) merely abbreviates (cid:8), [+, a](cid:9) (cid:8)+, [, a](cid:9); see appendix a.

 32 

that the canonical dimension of f and da is one more than that of a. therefore, if a
term in the lagrangian density is chosen so as to provide a kinetic term for asomething
like h|0a|2 + . . . with h an arbitrary analytic function of the available elds, then the
same term will also feature f and da with no derivatives on them.

type-b gauge elds

the independent component elds of the type-b gauge multiplet can similarly be specied
equivalently either as the component elds of the gauge-covariantly chiral supereld b, or
as the lowest component elds of the multiplet {b; w; f} given in  4.2:

[, b]| = 

2iw| ,

[, b]| = 

2iw| ,

b def= b| ,
def=  12

b def= 1

(5.8a)

(5.8b)

(5.8c)

b def= b| ,
def= 12

b def= 1

4 [, +]b| = if| ,

4 [+, ]b| = i f| .

these are the spin-(0; 1
2 ;0) component elds of the scalar gauge-covariantly chiral su-
pereld b = (b; ; b) and its hermitian conjugate, b = (b; ; b). the bosonic eld
strength, f| now equals (the negative of) the imaginary part of b:

fb

def= f| = e(f )| = m(b) .

(5.9)

the real part of b is easily shown now to be the lowest component of the supereld

db

def= 1

2i(cid:2){+, w}  {, w+}(cid:3)b = m(f ) ,

db

def= db| = m(f ) = e(b) .

(5.10)

where the subscript indicates projection on type-b gauge elds. again, both f and da
are real.

type-c= gauge elds
the type-c= gauge multiplet is equivalently described either as the component elds of
the gauge-covariantly chiral lefton c=, or as the lowest component elds of the gauge
multiplet {c=; w} of  4.3:

c=

based on the last remark of the previous subsection, the canonical dimension of a, b, c=

zumino-like gauge, and the numerical multipliers are inessential. the precise relation of the
component elds (5.5), (5.8), (5.11) and (5.12) to those in (5.3) is left to the diligent reader;
we proceed using the gauge covariant component elds (5.5), (5.8), (5.11) and (5.12).

6. lagrangian densities

all the numerous lagrangian densities listed in ref. [1] admit a straightforward extension
to include minimal coupling type gauge interactions: the fermionic integration must be
redened so as to use the covariant derivatives (2.1) instead the ordinary ones. section 1
and appendix a contain all the necessary conventions and notation.

6.1. kinetic terms for gauge elds

it is straightforward to write down (at) kinetic terms for the pure type-a and type-b
gauge elds [4]:

8z d4 kak2 ,
 1

and

8z d4 kbk2 ,

+ 1

(6.1)

where the relative sign ensures the correct sign for the bosonic terms.

it is immediately obvious that no such (at) kinetic terms exist for the type-c gauge
superelds! this may sound alarming, as it is sharply counterintuitive when compared

 34 

with the familiar situation in 3+1-dimensional spacetime. however, as we have just seen
in eqs. (5.11) and (5.12), the type-c gauge multiplets contain spin-(1,  3
2 ) elds, neither
of which is supposed to be a propagating degree of freedom in 1+1-dimensional spacetime.
a quantum treatment would have to introduce appropriate (and propagating) spin-(0,  1
2 )
ghost degrees of freedom, which then would carry the dynamics of this type of symmetry
gauging, and the study of which we defer to a later eort.

for illustrative purposes, consider however the pure type-a gauging of an abelian
symmetry, say u (1), with respect to which the a, a themselves are chargeless, and the
integration measure in the rst of the two integrals in (6.1) reduces to that one in eq. (1.6).

after straightforward d-algebra, we obtain for a single type-a u (1) gauge multiplet:

2 d2

a + 1

2 f2

identifying fa = 1
cd) since 01 = 1 = 10, the
last bosonic term becomes  1
(a), which is the standard lagrangian density for a
yang-mills gauge boson, given in terms of its eld strength. furthermore, one can write

ab and using that abcd = (ab

4f (a)

2 abf (a)

f (a)
ab = (aab  baa) ,

(6.3)

but the reader should be cautioned that the gauge vector potential aa carries no physical
degree of freedom in 1+1 dimensions. its only use is for identication with the components
of the 3+1-dimensional gauge vector potential along the 1+1-dimensional sub-spacetime;
the transversal components form the lowest components of the complex supereld, a,
a scalar from the 1+1-dimensional point of view.
in fact, it is not an accident that
4f (a)
 1
(a) emerges, in (6.1), as a half of the norm-squared of the auxiliary compo-
nent eld of a, with 1

a being the other half.

ab f ab

2 d2

up to a few numerical dierences in convention, this is in complete agreement with

ref. [4], and the dimensional reduction results obtained from refs. [6,7,8,9].

the second of the two lagrangians in (6.1) is equally easily evaluated for a single

type-b u (1) gauge multiplet:

1

8z d4 kbk2 = 1

4(cid:2)(=b)(=| b) + (=|

(6.4)

up to some numerical dierences of convention, this is again in agreement with the corre-
sponding result of ref. [4].

again, writing somewhat formally fb = 1
ab , the last bosonic term becomes
the standard yang-mills lagrangian density,  1
ab f ab
(b). this, however, is not the
result of dimensional reduction of any 3+1-dimensional yang-mills gauge multiplet and
the introduction of a gauge vector potential, ba through writing f (b)
ab = (abb  bba) is

2 abf (b)
4f (b)

 35 

merely for analogy. as mentioned in  4.2, the denition (2.11b) permits us to identify, in a
3+1-dimensional framework prior to dimensional reduction to 1+1-dimensions, the lowest
components of the supereld b, b as gauge elds covariantizing central charges, were such
to have been introduced.

for nonabelian gauge symmetry, the component eld expansions of the simple la-
grangian density terms (6.1) become rather more involved that their abelian versions (6.2)
and (6.4). in addition, even for pure type-a and type-b gauge multiplets, one can also
write down a superpotential term:

z d2/ tr (a) + h.c.,

and

z d2 tr w (b) + h.c.,

(6.5)

owing to the fact that in pure type-a gauging a is gauge-covariantly twisted-chiral, and
in pure type-b gauging b is gauge-covariantly chiral. the superpotentials,  and w , are
arbitrary analytic functions of their respective arguments, and tr makes the lagrangian
density terms gauge-invariant. note that this annihilates all linear terms for all nonabelian
factors in ga  gb. for the abelian, u (1), factors a linear (fayet-illiopoulos) term is
permitted by gauge invariance, and has been given a pivotal role in the gauged linear
-model of refs. [2] and subsequent work.

also, the kinetic terms (6.1) may well be generalized into

z d4 tr k(a, a; b, b) ,

(6.6)

where k is a general, real, function of its arguments, just as rst given in ref. [12]; gauge-
invariance is ensured by taking its trace. this of course does not in general produce the
standard yang-mills terms of the type  1
2 [m(a)2 + m(b)2], which
may be regarded as at. instead, eq. (6.6) yields an a, b-dependent set of terms the
nonlinearity of which is governed by the choice of the function k (6.6). of course, the
choice of the lagrangian, and the adherence to the standard one, is governed only by the
intended application. from the intrinsically 1+1-dimensional point of view, there is no
compelling reason in general not to consider the non-linear and rather general lagrangian
density term (6.6). moreover, the d-term (6.6) may well be made dependent on all available
elds:

4fab f ab, i.e., 1

z d4 tr k(a, a; b, b; c; c; . . .) ,

(6.7)

where the ellipses stand for any other available supereld, including those used to represent
matter. this of course makes the kinetic terms for all involved component elds depend,
in general, on all of the elds involved. most applications will only need a special case of
this general form, but we leave that to the decision of the interested reader, depending on
the intended application.

6.2. general terms for gauge elds

in unpure gauging types, such as the type-ac=, discussed briey in  4.5, the gauge
supereld a is no longer gauge-covariantly twisted-chiral, and neither is then the integrand

 36 

of the rst berezin integral in (6.5).
annihilated only by +. the triple berezin integral

instead, the supereld and so also tr(cid:0)(a)(cid:1) are

1

2z d d2/ tr(cid:0)(a)(cid:1)

would be supersymmetric and gauge-invariant, but its result has spin 12) + 1
2 , and so is
not suitable for adding to the lagrange density, which has spin 0. of course, if the
considered model also includes a spin-( 1
2 ) supereld which is also annihilated by +say,
an antichiral +, then

1

2z d d2/ tr(cid:0)(a)+(cid:1) = 1

4 tr(cid:0)[, +](a)+(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)

is a candidate term for the lagrangian density. since c=| 0 in type-ac= gauging,  2
+ = 0,
and with a suitable twisted-antichiral supereld, , we may replace + in the above
expressions freely with a linear combination of + and +. since also [+, a]=0,
the + may be passed to the left and this addition, upon including also the hermitian
conjugate, becomes proportional to the d-term

(6.8)

(6.9)

(6.10)

1

4 tr(cid:0)4 (a)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) .

typically, models are chosen to include the most general d-term (on the premise that
quantum corrections will typically generate such terms anyway), so that this addition is
already accounted for as a special case of a (d-)term in the total lagrangian. however,
under special circumstances (when quantum corrections will either not be considered or
are suciently restricted by (additional) symmetry), it is perfectly possible to include no
general d-term in the lagrangian, whence the term (6.10) is indeed a new addition.

6.3. interaction with matter

ref. [1] has uncovered a great many candidate termseach (2,2)-supersymmetric all by
itselffor the lagrangian density involving matter represented by the constrained super-
elds (3.1), (3.12) and (3.13).

it is straightforward to turn all these lagrangian density terms into their gauge-
invariant counterparts, provided a trace over the gauge group action is taken in addition
to fermionic integration, as illustrated in eq. (6.7). this trace automatically projects out
gauge-noninvariant choices of the lagrangian densities. consider, for example, a collection
of n chiral superelds, i, coupled to a type-a gauged su (n) symmetry with respect to
which the i transform as the fundamental representation. then, the analytic function
w () appearing in the gauge-invariant f -term

1

2z d2 tr w () = 1
12) recall that r d   , so it has spin + 1

measure in eq. (6.8) would suggest.

4 tr(cid:0)[, +]w ()(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2 , not  1

2 as the nave reading of the integration

(6.11)

 37 

is restricted by the trace operation in front to

tr w () =

xk=0

wk([n])k ,

[n] def= tr(cid:0)i1in i1  in(cid:1) .

(6.12)

this follows on realizing that powers of [n] are the only holomorphic (chiral) su (n)-
invariants one can make from i. were the gauge group chosen to be the so(n)  su (n)
subgroup, w () would become

tr w () =

xk,l=0

wk,l([n])k((2))l ,

(2) def= tr(cid:0)iijj(cid:1) ,

(6.13)

where the kronecker ij is the so(n)-invariant metric. note that in both cases the initial
(constant) term in the series is irrelevant, as it is annihilated in the berezin integra-
tion (6.11).

keeping such gauge group dependent restrictions in mind, we conclude that all the
candidate lagrangian density terms listed in [1] can be used, and that all couplings of
the matter (super)elds to the gauge (super)elds stem from the covariantization of the
berezin integration process, i.e., from replacing the superderivatives in the superdieren-
tial equivalents of the various berezin integrals with the gauge-covariant superderivatives.
of course, one should also add the gauge-kinetic terms (6.7). moreover, the gauge super-
elds may also be included in the construction of all lagrangian density terms, e.g., the
superpotential function in (6.11), may also be allowed to depend on b, these being chiral.
since the  are b-chargeless, [b, ]=0, and the superpotential factorizes into a product
of the (type-a gauge invariant) w () and a (type-b gauge invariant) function of b.

with that in mind, we now turn to a sample calculation.

the general gauge-invariant d-term
consider a model built from the following collection of gauge-covariantly constrained su-
perelds:

,  = 1, . . . , nc ,

a, a = 1, . . . , nl ,
i, i = 1, . . . , nr ,

this information suces to work out the projections by all of the superderivative operators
given in fig. 1 in  5, which in turn suces to determine the component eld lagrangian
densities in all cases. the reader may wish to use the intermediate results collected in
appendix c.

as an example, we present here the general d-term, for which we use the gauge-

covariant form of (1.6):

1

4z d4 k = 1

32 tr(cid:2){[, ], [+, +]}k(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12) .

 38 

(6.15)

the so dened berezin integration is hermitian; if k=k is a hermitian function of its
arguments, so is the resulting term in the lagrangian density. furthermore, this berezin
d4-integral is even under parity, and odd under the mirror map, c+ of ref. [1]as it
should [12]. this latter property we nd the crucial reason for adopting (6.15) over the
choice of ref. [4], which transcribed into our notation becomes

terms for the lagrangian density such as (6.15) (and all the many other found in
ref. [1]) may be expanded for the general case as follows. let  denote a string of all the
superelds on which k depends; we assume nothing about (anti)commutivity of . for
example, we may set  = (, , , , a, a, i, , . . .), including all the species
of superelds on which k may depend in addition to what was specied above. then,
expressions like (o11)(o22)k12 simply abbreviate the sum over all species

ought to be obvious.

without any assumption regarding (anti)commutivity of , we expand the integrand

most frequently, the s simply stand for a string of bosonic (commuting) superelds,
()1 =    = (1)4 = +1, and the multiple derivatives of k() satisfy the usual sym-
metrization: k12 = k21, k123 = k(123) and k1234 = k(1234), and the (anti)commutivity
of (multiple) derivatives (o) stems solely from the (anti)commutivity of the (multiple)

all lagrangian densities obtained in this way involve a nal ,  = 0 projection, which
can be performed on the expansions (6.18) and (6.19) term by term and factor by factor,
using the projections collected in appendix c. the nal insertion of these projections and
the collection of (very many) terms for the general d-term (6.15), and any other of the
many possible terms [1], we leave to the diligent reader.

7. summary, outlook and conclusions

the above analysis shows how to couple matter elds, represented by constrained super-
elds 13) (3.1) and (3.13), to minimally coupled gauge (super)elds.

considering the most general gauge-covariant extension of the supersymmetry alge-
bra (2.11) and the consistency requirements (appendix b), we nd that 1+1-dimensional
theories admit four distinct types of symmetry gauging:  4.14.4. furthermore, allowing
for a duplication among gauge supereld components, there also exist additional, mixed
types of symmetry gauging; see  4.5.

given the wealth of candidate lagrangian density terms listed in ref. [1], this uncovers
a vast arena in which to generalize the results of refs. [2,3,4,5]. the methods of refs. [13,14]
then are well suited to explore the geometry of the target spaces as related to the quantum
dynamics in these models.

the projection method described above makes it possible to straightforwardly gauge-
covariantize all of the candidate lagrangian density terms listed in ref. [1]. the process
reduces to the following ve steps:

1. select a candidate lagrangian density term from ref. [1]. above, we chose r d4 k.

2. gauge-covariantize the chosen term by substituting gauge-covariant superderivatives

and applying the overall trace operation. above, this produces the d-term (6.15)

13) recall that the quartoid superelds (3.12) cannot couple to any of the gauge elds by means
of minimal coupling.

 41 

3. expand the (multiple) superderivatives; to this end, the identities in appendix a are

useful. above, this resulted in the expansions (6.18) and (6.19).

4. perform the ,  = 0 projections; to this end, the intermediate results in appendix c
are useful. this nal (and voluminous) collection of the results for the general d-
term (6.15), and any other of the many possible terms [1], we leave to the interested
reader.

5. the previous two steps in the calculation are more easily performed using the gauge
group index notation (2.6)(2.8). the results can then be recast into the perhaps
neater matrix notation, tidying the results further by using the cyclicity of the overall
trace operation.

for each of these candidate lagrangian density terms, supersymmetry is most easily
proven upon the non-unitary decovariantization described in  4.7. on the other hand, the
gauge-covariant formalism used throughout makes gauge invariance manifest.

the combination of the above results and techniques, and the large number of can-
didate lagrangian density terms [1] guarantees an unsuspected wealth of various (2,2)-
supersymmetric gauged -models in 1+1-dimensional spacetime. this provides a vast
number of generalizations to the models of refs. [2,3,4,5], and a stable framework for
exploring these generalizations.

appendix a. absolutely basic conventions (abc)

we follow ref. [1]s adaptation of wess and baggers denitions [7]. the , + (spinorial)
indices actually indicate spin: =+ has spin  1
2 . since
 def= , but  def=    , it follows that

2 , whereas += has spin + 1

2 = [+, ] = 2+ ,

but

2 = [, +] = 2 + ,

2 = [+, ] = 2+ ,
+ ,
2 = [ , +] = 2 

and where we used + = 1 = +; we also use 01 = 1 = 10.

the formulae (a.1) explain the order of the superderivatives in (1.7); for example,

z d2 ( 2) = 1

2 [d, d+](2 +)(cid:12)(cid:12) = 2 .

(a.1a)

(a.1b)

(a.2)

(a.3)

(a.4)

owing to the functional equivalence of the berezin integration to derivative, spinorial dirac
delta-functions are particularly simple, e.g., ( +)   +. multiple delta-functions are of
course products of simple ones, and we merely have to choose the order and the sign.
fixing 4() def=   + + so that r d4 4() = 1, we set

2() =  + ,

2(/) =  + ,
2(\) =   +,

2(r) =   ,
2(l) =  + + ,

2( ) =   + ,

so that eqs. (1.7) follow from (1.6).

switching to gauge-covariant (super)derivatives, the following operatorial identity may



be of help. let i range over the gauge-covariant superderivatives (2.1). then:

12 = 1

2 [1, 2] + 1

2{1, 2} ,

so that

[1, 2] = 212  {1, 2} = {1, 2}  221 .

then, for example

[, ]  2(  i=)  2(  i=) ,
[+, +]  2(++  i=| )  2(++  i=| ) ,

and so on. similarly,

[, ]  2i=  2c= ,
[, ]  2c=  2i= ,
[+, +]+  2i=| +  2+c=| ,
[+, +]+  2+c=|  2i=| + .

when using gauge-covariant derivatives to calculate gauge-covariant berezin inte-
gralsor, indeed, simply apply to superelds, the (anti)commutator notation is more
precise, albeit also more cumbersome. let

so that

if x is (cid:26) commutative,

which case it is an anticommutator. then,

z d 1 x

def= 1

def= d1x(cid:12)(cid:12)  [1, x}(cid:12)(cid:12) ,
2 [d1, d2]x(cid:12)(cid:12)  1

2(cid:2)[1, [2], x}(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

and so on, iterating these two expressions. note that the index on the s is meant to
encode also the conjugation bar. before switching to the nested (anti)commutator notation,
the expression (1.6) merely needed covariantization:

z d4 (. . .) def= 1

8(cid:8)[, ], [+, +](cid:9)(. . .)(cid:12)(cid:12) def= (4 . . .)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

(6.15)

finally, to obtain the gauge-covariant d-term projector corresponding to the berezin d4-
integration, the substitution (a.11b) is iterated twice.

the full d4 integration measure actually corresponds to the full, totally antisym-
metrized product of the four superderivatives. however, it is not necessary to calcu-
late with all the 4! permutations of ++, as many are equivalent up to total
derivatives. this leads to various choices of calculationally convenient subsets of the 4!
quartic superderivatives for the assignment r d4[. . .]  (4 . . .)|. several such choices

are readily found in the literature, typically obtained through dimensional reduction from
3+1-dimensional n =1 supersymmetry. however, our discussion of 1+1-dimensional (2, 2)-
supersymmetric gauge theories follows the intrinsic approach of ref. [1], disregarding as
much as possible dimensional reduction. we then require the assignment (6.15) to satisfy
the usual requirement of hermiticity, and evenness under parity. in addition, we require
that 4 should be odd with respect to the mirror map, c+ [1]. the latter requirement
would necessitate a doubling of terms for the ref. [4]s choice, but leaves (6.15) as it is.
this choice provides for greater symmetry between type-a and type-b gauged models with
chiral and twisted-chiral superelds, although it also causes a few minor dierences when
comparing with the framework set-up (but not the results presented) in ref. [4].


 44 

the work with nested (anti)commutators is simplied a good deal by using the deriva-

tive (operatorial) identities:

and

in particular, then

(cid:2)xy , z(cid:9)  x(cid:2)y , z(cid:9) + ()(y )(z)(cid:2)x, z(cid:9)y ,
(cid:2)x, y z(cid:9) (cid:2)x, y(cid:9)z + ()(x)(y )x(cid:2)y , z(cid:9) .
(cid:2), xy(cid:9) (cid:2), x(cid:9)y + ()(x)x(cid:2), y(cid:9) .

iterating this for superderivatives 1, 2, we obtain

(cid:2)1, [2, xy }(cid:9)
(cid:2)1, [2, x}(cid:9)y + ()(x)[[1, x}[2], y } + x(cid:2)1, [2, y }(cid:9) .

where bracketing indices indicates their antisymmetrization, as in (2.16d); it stems from
the anticommutivity of the s. when x and y are simple (multiplicative) commuting
superelds and 1, 2 superderivatives, this reduces to

(12xy ) = (12x)y + ()(x)2(1x)(2y ) + x(12y ) ,

(a.12a)

(a.12b)

(a.13)

(a.14)

(a.15)

(a.16)

(a.17)

in agreement with eq. (a.11) of ref. [1].

the (anti)commutator analogue of the chain rule is

iterating this, we obtain

[, f (x)}  [, x} f(x) .

(cid:2)1, [2, f (x)}(cid:9)  (cid:2)1, [2, x}(cid:9) f(x)  [2, x}[1, x}f(x) ,

which, after antisymmetrizing of the superderivatives, shows how to apply the expres-
sions (a.11b) for a two-fold gauge-covariant berezin integration. when x i are simple
(multiplicative) commuting superelds and 1, 2 superderivatives, this reduces to

(12 f (x))  (12x i) f,i(x)  (2x i)(1x j)f,ij (x) .

(a.18)
note that the order of superderivatives becomes reversed in the second term:(1x j) is not
trivial to pass back to the left, as the (superderivatives of) x i may not (anti)commute.

finally, the jacobi identities (see appendix b) imply the following two identities:

{1, [2, x]} = {2, [1, x]} + [{1, 2}, x] ,

= 1

2{[1, [2], x]} + 1

2 [{1, 2}, x] ,

(a.19a)

(a.19b)

the latter of which is also seen as an application of the operatorial identity (a.5).

a combined iteration of the above identities typically simplies most of the calculations
signicantly. even so, however, the considerable technical tedium makes one wish for a
mechanization of these calculations. short of this, we present the details of the calculations
involving the (graded) jacobi identities and component eld projections in the next two

 45 

appendices, and several sample results are presented within the body of the article; we
hope this will suce for the interested reader to master the technique.

a nal remark is in order, relating to eq. (2.5). the original denitions in  2.1 imply
a matrix representation of lie algebra-valued objects, which is especially important in
case of nonabelian symmetries. that is, the gauge-covariant derivatives , and all gauge
(super)elds should be regarded as square matrices. on column-vectors x, these act from
the left, but on row-vectors x, they should act from the right. to avoid a meticulous
indication of this leftward action, we adopt a mixed notation in which various derivatives
act always from the left, whereas lie algebra valued objects act as appropriate. thus
(suppressing spacetime, i.e., spin indices):

x = dx  ix ,

but x = dx  ix ,

(a.20)

which also follows from eq. (2.5). for the record, in the explicit gauge group index notation,
this is


 x  = dx   i

 x  ,

but 

x = dx  ix
 ,

(a.21)

where now the ordering of the superelds, both being bosonic, no longer matters.

as lagrangian density terms must be gauge-invariant, the fermionic integration is
also meant to implicitly include a trace over the gauge group action. but then, owing to
the cyclicity of the trace operator and using eq. (2.5), the product rule yields, e.g.,

tr(cid:2)xx(cid:3) = tr(cid:2)x

x(cid:3) + tr(cid:2)x

x(cid:3) ,

= tr(cid:2)x(x)(cid:3) + tr(cid:2)(tx t)t x(cid:3) ,
g1gx(cid:3) .
g1gx(cid:3) + tr(cid:2)xg1g

tr(cid:2)xg1g

(a.22)

(a.23)

where both terms are separately gauge-invariant, as they transform into

higher order superderivative analogues of this are not dicult to obtain iterating the
chain rule (a.22). this proves their gauge-invariance and also allows explicit calculations
in terms of the projections listed in appendix c.

the only alternative to this procedure is the use of the (de)covariantizing non-unitary
transformation (4.46). this lets the berezin integration to be calculated as a projection
using gauge-noncovariant superderivatives d, d which act on all superelds standardly,
from the left. the berezin integrand, in turn, becomes covariantized through the explicit
insertion of factors such as hh = e2v in (4.51), in case of the at kinetic term for
a chiral supereld. such covariantizing factors would have to be determined separately
for every other candidate term for the lagrangian density. to the best of our knowledge,
the use of this gauge non-covariant notation and framework is prevalent in the existing
literature. in spite of the slight notational awkwardness described above, we choose instead
the gauge covariant notation and framework for its universality.

appendix b. graded jacobi identities

the general, graded jacobi (cyclic) identity (cid:2)x <i, [x j, x k>}(cid:9)  0, is a property of

the binary operation (a.10), and does not depend on the (derivative, multiplicative or
otherwise) nature of x i; < . . . > here indicates a summation over cyclic permutations of
the enclosed indices. it is therefore used to verify the consistency of the algebra (2.11).

the jacobi identities involving three spinorial s are:

(b.1j)
and the ten identities (b.1k t), omitted here, but obtained from (b.1a j) upon a +
swap in the subscripts (note that this changes the signs of the ws, swaps aa but
leaves b, b intact).

the jacobi identities involving one vectorial and two spinorial s are:

all these are identically satised upon substituting one of eqs. (2.16) and some of the
eqs. (2.12). finally the jacobi identities involving only bosonic s are trivially satised
as there is only two bosonic s.

appendix c. component projections

the following is a collection of identities and component eld projections which the diligent
reader may nd useful.

superderivatives of the fermionic eld strength superelds
below are listed a half of the non-zero superderivatives of the spinorial eld strength
superelds; the other half is implied by hermitian conjugation.

type-a: {, w} = +(cid:2)=, a(cid:3), {+, w} = f + i
4(cid:2)a, a(cid:3),
{+, w+} = (cid:2)=| , a(cid:3), {, w+} = f + i
4(cid:2)a, a(cid:3).
4(cid:2)b, b(cid:3),
type-b: {, w} = (cid:2)=, b(cid:3), {+, w} = f + i
4(cid:2)b, b(cid:3).
{+, w+} = +(cid:2)=| , b(cid:3), {, w+} = f  i
2(cid:2)c=, c=(cid:3), {+, w} = (cid:2)=, c=(cid:3).
type-c=: {, w} = + i
2(cid:2)c=| , c=|(cid:3), {+, w=

upon the ,  = 0 projection, this provides (dierential) relations among the compo-
nent elds of the gauge superelds. however, the above (super)dierential relations among
the gauge superelds also hold without any projection.

component projections of matter superelds
in sections 5 and 6, we need the non-zero gauge-covariant projections of a gauge-covariantly
chiral supereld (3.1a), including for completeness those listed in (5.1a):

| = ; | = 2;
[, +]| = 4f , +| = a, +| = a,
[, ]| = 2i(=),
[+, +]| = 2i(=| );
[, ]+| = 22(a + )  22i(=+), +[, ]| = 2,
[+, +]| = 22(a+  a+)  22i(=| ), [+, +]| = +2a+,
+[, ]| = 2[  2i(=+)], [+, +]| = 2[a+ + 2i(=| )];
and nally, {[, ], [+, +]}| = 8() + 8da + 4(+  a+).
note: since {, +} = b = 0, then also +| = 2f and +| = 2f .

the corresponding projections of a gauge-covariantly antichiral supereld are obtained

by hermitian conjugation, using eq. (2.5):

| = ; | = 2 ; ([, +]t)t| = 4f , (+t)t| = a, (+t)t| = a,
([, ]t)t| = 2i(= ), ([+, +]t)t| = 2i(=|
([, ]+t)t| = 22( a + )  22i(= +), (+[, ]t)t| = 2,
([+, +]t)t| = 22( +a  a+)  22i(=|
), ([+, +]t)t| = +2a+,
(+[, ]t)t| = 2[2i(= +)], ([+, +]t)t| = 2[a++2i(=|
)];
and (cid:0){[, ], [+, +]}t(cid:1)t| = 8() + 8da + 4( +  a+).
as with , we also have +| = 2f and +| = 2f .
| = x; | = 2, +| = 2+; +| = bx, +| = bx,
[, +]| = 4x,
[, ]+| = 22i(=+) + 22(b + x), +[, ]| = 2 x,
[+, +]| = 22i(=| )  22(b+  +x), [+, +]| = 2+x,
+[, ]| = 2[x2i(=+)], [+, +]| = 2[ +x+2i(=| )];
and nally, {[, ], [+, +]}| = +8(x)  8dbx + 4(+  +).
in analogy to , , we also have +| = 2x and +| = 2x.
| = x; | = 2, +| = 2+; (+t)t| = xb, (+t)t| = xb,
([, +]t)t| = 4x, ([, ]t)t| = 2i(= x), ([+, +]t)t| = 2i(=| x);
([, ]+t)t| = 22i(= +) + 22(
([+, +]t)t| = 22i(=|
(+[, ]t)t| = 2[x 2i(= +)], ([+, +]t)t| = 2[x++2i(=|
and ({[, ], [+, +]}t)t| = +8(x)  8xdb + 4(
again, we also have +| = 2x and +| = 2x.
the needed projections of a gauge-covariant lefton are:
| = ; +| = 2+, +| = 2+;
[+, +]| = 4l=| ,
+| = b, +| = a, +| = a, +| = b;
[, ]+| = 2( + ), [+, +]| = 22(b+  a+) + 2(a+  +),
[, ]+| = 2( + ), [+, +]| = 22(a+  b+) + 2(a+  +),
{[, ], [+, +]}| = ({a, a}  {b,b}) + 2[( + )+  ( + )+].
| = r; | = 2, | = 2;
+| = br, +| = ar, +| = ar, +| = br;
[+, +]| = 2( +  a+)r, +[, ]| = 22(b  a)  2( + )r,
[+, +]| = 2(+  a+)r, +[, ]| = 22(a  b)  2( + )r,
{[, ], [+, +]}| = ({a, a}  {b,b})r  2[(a+  +)  (a+  +)].
when evaluating candidate lagrangian density terms other then (6.15), additional
projections may be necessary. given the above list, the derivation of such additional
projections should pose no signicant problem for the interested reader.

the needed projections of a gauge-covariant righton are:
