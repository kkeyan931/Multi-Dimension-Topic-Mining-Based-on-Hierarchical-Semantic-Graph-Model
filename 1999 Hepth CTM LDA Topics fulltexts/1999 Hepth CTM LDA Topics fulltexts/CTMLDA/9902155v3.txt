abstract

we derive a solution of type iib supergravity which is asymptotic to ads5  s5,
has so(6) symmetry, and exhibits some of the features expected of geometries dual
to conning gauge theories. at the linearized level, the solution diers from pure
ads5  s5 only by a dilaton prole. it has a naked singularity in the interior. wilson
loops follow area law behavior, and there is a mass gap. we suggest a eld theory
interpretation in which all matter elds of n = 4 gauge theory acquire a mass and the
infrared theory is conning.

1 introduction

one of the interesting aspects of the ads/cft conjecture [1, 2, 3] is that energy plays
the role of an extra dimension: a fth dimension if we are working with four-dimensional
quantum eld theories. the expectation is that the gravitational equations which
dictate the bulk geometry to be equivalent in some sense to the renormalization group
(rg) equations for the quantum eld theory (qft). it is dicult from a mathematical
point of view to see how this can be, since the rg equations are rst order while the
supergravity equation are second order. it is also dicult to gain intuition regarding
the problem from examining the conformal case, since there the anti-de sitter is self-
similar with respect to motions in the fth dimension, and the evolution under rg is
trivial.

it is desirable, then, to come up with examples where the quantum eld theory is not
conformal. the obvious approach is to start with n = 4 super-yang-mills theory and
add some relevant operators, corresponding to tachyon elds (m2 < 0) in ads5. it turns
out to be very dicult to nd a supergravity solution with such elds excited because
they all have so(6) quantum numbers: that is, they come from ten-dimensional elds
with some non-trivial variation on s5. recently, progress has been made in this di-
rection by considering the truncation of the kaluza-klein (kk) reduction of type iib
supergravity on s5 to ve-dimensional gauged supergravity [4, 5]. this amounts to
keeping only the rst few spherical harmonics for each ten-dimensional eld in the
ve-dimensional theory.
in this setup, rg ows in a boundary qft are supposed
to be reected in a dependence on the fth dimension of the scalars in the gauged
supergravity theory. it has been speculated [6] that any solution of ve-dimensional
maximally supersymmetric gauged supergravity can be lifted to an exact solution of
the ten-dimensional theory, in analogy with the embedding of maximally supersym-
metric four-dimensional gauged supergravity in eleven-dimensional supergravity [7].
so far, the only examples in which the ow equations are known explicitly break all
supersymmetry.

in this paper, we wish to take an approach which is much simpler from the point
of view of supergravity calculations: we will study geometries which preserve the full
so(6) invariance as well as the 3+1-dimensional poincare symmetry of the boundary
quantum eld theory. it would seem to follow from the no-hair theorems that any such
geometry other than the full d3-brane metric must have a naked singularity, and this
indeed is the case for the geometry which we will exhibit in section 3. unlike the full
d3-brane metric, our geometry is asymptotic to ads5s5 far from the singularity. it is
tempting to guess that its eld theory image (in the holographic sense of ads/cft)
is n = 4 super-yang-mills theory deformed by a relevant operator. the diculty is
that at strong coupling, ads/cft itself predicts that there are no relevant operators

1

which are so(6) singlets. in section 5 we will suggest that a solution to this dilemma
is to add to the lagrangian an so(6)-invariant mass term for scalars. this operator
corresponds to an excited string state in ads5  s5.

in section 4 we show that our geometry satises the usual criterion for connement,
namely the area law for wilson loops and a mass gap. this is hardly unexpected from
the perturbative eld theory point of view, since connement is the generic behavior
for gauge theory coupled to massive matter. finally, in section 6, we discuss the global
structure of the geometry and obtain the conditions under which supergravity is a valid
approximation.

in ten-dimensional type iib supergravity, the most general ansatz with so(6) symme-
try, 3+1-dimensional poincare invariance, and n units of ve-form ux through an s5

where , , and also the dilaton  and the axion c, are allowed to depend only on the
radial coordinate z. the dilaton and the axion combine to form the complex coupling
 = c +ie, which in the ads/cft correspondence is identied with /2+4i/g2
y m .
we will always work in einstein frame unless otherwise noted explicitly.

the relevant equations of type iib supergravity, truncated to the elds we are in-

terested in, read [8]

the weyl factor on the non-compact part of the metric in (1) was chosen expressly so
that the wave equation  = 0 for a minimal scalar in the s-wave would reduce to the

it is possible to reduce the equations of motion (6) to a set of coupled non-linear
second order ordinary dierential equations in , c, , and . these equations seem
too complicated to deal with in general, but there is an obvious simplication: c = 0
and  = 0. then the equations become much simpler:

in future sections we will usually deal with the full ten-dimensional einstein metric.
because  = 0 there is no distinction between the ve-dimensional einstein metric and
the ten-dimensional einstein metric restricted to the ve-dimensional non-compact
space. so we will drop the hats from ten-dimensional quantities.

the rst equation follows from dierentiating the second, so we see that (8) is a con-
sistent system of equations despite being overdetermined. physically, (10) describes
the zero-energy trajectory of a classical particle with unit mass moving in the potential
v () =  1
48 e6, which is depicted in gure 1. we regard z = ul as a radial
variable which goes to 0 at the boundary of the geometry, where  becomes large. thus
in our mechanical analog, we are starting the particle at  =  at time u = 0. in
nite time the particle gets to  = 0. if b = 0, then it continues to move to the left
in gure 1 ever more slowly as u  . but for b 6= 0, the particle reaches a mini-
mum velocity at some  < 0, and then falls back down the other side of the potential
after a nite time u0. the b = 0 solution is pure ads5 with constant dilaton. not
unexpectedly, the b 6= 0 geometry is geodesically incomplete and singular at the point
u = u0. to nd u0 explicitly, we use the standard trick for integrating the motion in a
one-dimensional potential well:

we can nd the dilaton explicitly in terms of  by performing the integral in (9):

note that  increases as  decreases, and    as   , which is what we
expect since the far interior of the geometry (  ) corresponds to the infrared in
the gauge theory. we can also write the ten-dimensional einstein metric explicitly if
we use  rather than z as the radial variable:

from (12) and (13) it is evident that we can cancel the factors of b2

components of the metric, we should also rescale t  (cid:16) b2

24 by sending
24 in the world-volume

in order not to reintroduce factors of b2

if we also rescale z  (cid:16) b2

for i = 1, 2, 3.
z then the net result is the same
as if we had set b2 = 24 throughout this section. choice of the radial coordinate
in ads5 corresponds to choice of one out of a given class of conformally equivalent
boundary metrics. thus we see that the freedom to change b in the solution (12), (13)
corresponds merely to the asymptotic scale invariance of the boundary theory.

4 connement

the string coupling gets strong as   , but this does not necessarily mean
connement, as illustrated in [10], where the far interior of a d3-brane geometry in
a type 0 string theory was found to be ads5  s5 geometry with formally innite
dilaton. the most straightforward test of connement in the context of holography
[12] is the area law for wilson loops. the metric felt by strings is not the einstein
metric (13), but rather the string metric

in [11], more generic interior geometries were explored and shown to exhibit properties of con-
nement. these solutions are similar in spirit and in global structure to ours. we thank j. minahan
for bringing this work to our attention.

figure 2: log n = 2 + ( )/2 as a function of  for b2 = 24 (solid line) and b = 0

following [13, 14, 12], we consider a fundamental string following a trajectory ending on
specied points of the boundary of the asymptotically ads5 geometry which minimizes
the nambu-goto action,

in the second line we have assumed that the string is at a constant angular position in
s5, and we have set 0 = t, 1 = x1 = x, and x2 = x3 = 0. the time integral is trivial,
so we see that the integral whose minimum determines the string trajectory is

v =

1

2 z dx n(z)vuut1 +  dz
dx!2

,

(16)

where we have dened n(z) = e((z))/2+2(z). the form (16) is suggestive of fermats
principle for the path of light rays:
if n(z) is regarded as the refractive index,
then v is the total time (or more properly, the total distance in the at metric
ds2 = dx2 + dz2) it takes to traverse the trajectory followed by the light ray (more
properly, the string). as one can see from gure 2, n(z) has a global minimum when
48 . in the light ray analogy,
connement is realized as total internal reection: for large separation of endpoints,
the trajectory which minimizes v locates itself very nearly at the minimum of n(z) for

b 6= 0, namely n = (2 + 3)3/8(cid:16) b2

to the minimum of n(z). when the separation r of the two endpoints is much larger
than l, we have

note that in (18) we have dened gs as the string coupling at the boundary of the

the second test of connement used in [12] is the presence of a mass gap. this is
straightforward to check for perturbations of the dilaton in our geometry. because the

this radial equation follows from plugging the ansatz  = eikxr()y into the

table 1: numerical values for glueball masses with b2 = 24.

for  to be everywhere small, we must choose c2 = c4 = 0. these conditions determine
a boundary-value problem with a discrete spectrum for e. it has been proposed [15]
that the corresponding massive states in the gauge theory have an interpretation of
glueballs. let us label the eigen-energies as en, where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . labels the
glueball excitation level and  = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . is its so(6) principle quantum number.
from (21) we extract the masses:

we tabulate numerical values for the rst few glueball states in table 1. one sees
immediately that the same problem that vexed early eorts [15, 16] using the near-
extremal d4-brane approach to qcd4 also occurs here: namely, the glueballs with
so(6) charge have masses on the same order as the so(6)-neutral glueballs.

the lowest glueball mass associated with the dilaton may not be the minimum
energy excitation mgap of the theory, since there are other excitations of comparable
energy associated with the other supergravity elds. however mgap should at least be
on the order of the lowest glueball mass in table 1. from (24) and (19) we see that

5 field theory interpretation

in the previous section we saw that the geometry (13) exhibits the basic features of
connement: the area law for wilson loops and a mass gap. given the ultraviolet
z4
behavior of the dilaton,    + b
l4 , an obvious interpretation in view of [17] is
that we have described a state with nonzero htr f 2i. in this section we would like to
investigate an alternative interpretation suggested by the conning properties of the
infrared geometry: namely, that the matter elds of n = 4 super-yang-mills theory
have been made massive in an so(6)-invariant fashion, breaking all supersymmetry as
well as conformal invariance, and leaving us with only the gauge elds below the mass
scale.

we can give the scalars an so(6)-invariant mass by adding m2

i to the
lagrangian. also we can give an so(6) symmetric majorana mass to the fermions,
since they transform in a real representation of the gauge group.
in perturbation
theory, either type of mass would induce the other via loops, and the theory in the
infrared would be a conning gauge theory, perhaps coupled to massive matter if some
of it is no heavier than the connement scale. let us focus on the scalar mass, and

x trp6

i=1 x 2

i .

write ok = trpi x 2
thinking of n = 4 gauge theory in n = 1 language, the operator ok is the rst com-
i=1 i ev i, where i are the three chiral matter
ponent of the konishi supereld, trp3
multiplets. ok is neither a chiral primary nor the descendent of a chiral primary, so its
dimension is not protected by the superconformal algebra. in [2, 3] it was conjectured
that all such operators are dual to excited string states in ads5  s5, and that they
acquire dimensions on the order (g2
y m n)1/4 at large t hooft coupling. in the absence of
a completely satisfactory formalism for quantizing strings in ads5 s5, what we mean
by excited string states is simply all fundamental string states except the ones which
participate in the ten-dimensional type iib supergravity multiplet. but the geometry
described in section 3 involved only the supergravity elds, so how can ok have any-
thing to do with it? precisely because k is large, the inuence of the eld k dual
to ok on the geometry should fall o very quickly as one moves toward the interior of
ads5. the only eect that k could have on the geometry which would persist into
the interior is to source a low-dimension so(6)-invariant eld. the only candidates
(see the tables in [18]) are the dilaton, the axion, and the overall volume of s5that is,
the elds involved in the ansatz (1). the corresponding operators in the gauge theory

are, respectively, tr f 2, tr f f , and str hf1
1)2i, plus
contributions from the gauginos and scalars, and their dimensions are, respectively,
four, four, and eight. str is the symmetrized trace. let us call these operators o4, o4,
and o8. we can exclude o4 from consideration by insisting on cp invariance. the
operator o8 itself is irrelevant, and so is also expected to have only a brief inuence
on the geometry as one ows inward from the boundary. if we exclude this operator
from consideration, then the conclusion is that the only way in which a perturbation
of k near the boundary ads5 can inuence the geometry far from the boundary is
to produce a gradient for the dilaton.
it seems guaranteed that k will source the

i at zero gauge coupling. as we turn on the gauge coupling, trpi x 2

we thank a. grant for pointing this out.
the discussion that follows is simplied if ok has denite dimension. this is true of ok =
trpi x 2
i may mix with other
operators. if so, then we think of ok as the resulting operator of denite dimension, and we expect
that ok still has some component of trpi x 2
we put the word eld in quotes because it is not clear that a eld theory of excited string states
exists in any meaningful form. nevertheless we will use the notion of the eld k as an intuitive
guide.

(g2
the skeptic may now wonder how it is possible to add a highly irrelevant operator
to n = 4 gauge theory at some high energy scale and see dramatic eects in the
infrared. the optimist would reply that it is an extreme example of a dangerous
irrelevant operatorby which we mean an operator which, as a perturbation of the
ultraviolet theory, has large dimension, but which becomes marginal or even relevant
along the rg ow. (usually in discussions of dangerous irrelevant operators one has
in mind perturbing a theory which is gaussian in the uv, but here we are thinking of
deforming strong-coupling n = 4 gauge theory, which is never gaussian). in fact, the
supergravity geometry deviates signicantly from ads5 only for z > l/ 4b, so if the

k perturbation is located at a much smaller z, then there is a large scaling region
(in the sense of critical phenomena: many orders of magnitude in energy) in which
the theory is nearly conformal. we should add that an operator ok with denite
dimension and a nite trpi x 2
i component is not the only operator one might consider
adding.
in the language of the optimist, any dangerous irrelevant operator will do,
provided it is an so(6) singlet, and provided one can argue (along the lines of (25), for
example) that its dual eld in string theory triggers a dilaton ow. our eld theory
intuition is that only operators which are in some sense strong coupling analogs of soft
mass breakings or relevant yukawa couplings are candidates for dangerous irrelevant
operators. connement is generic behavior once superconformal invariance is lost. as
we ow toward the infrared past the point where the heavy string eld has damped out,
the only relevant information for determining the subsequent ow is the coecient b
in (12). in short, b parametrizes our ignorance of how the superconformal invariance
is broken in the ultraviolet.

if we are willing to make some crude estimates, we can see how the mass gap depends
on the strength of the ok perturbation. suppose we cut o the geometry at z = 
rather than allowing it to go all the way out to the natural boundary at z = 0. let
us dene the theory at z =  by setting the value of the dilaton,  = , and also a
nite value for the excited string eld, k = 2. we regard k as a dimensionless
eld, so  is a dimensionless mass parameter: k = 2 on the boundary corresponds
to having a term in the lagrangian of the form m2
i where mx = /. this
is to be compared with the near-extremal d4-brane approach to qcd4 [12], where
mfermions = t and t is the temperature of the 4+1-dimensional theory. in both cases
the terms in the bare 3+1-dimensional lagrangian which give matter elds masses have
a coecient which is an energy squared.

we have assumed in this analysis that there is a scaling region, where z   but the
geometry is still nearly ads5. signicant deviations from ads5 come at z = l/b1/4 
/   provided   1, so the story is consistent provided that the scalar mass
mx = / which we put into the theory is much lower than the scale 1/ at which
we dene it. in fact, the explicit cuto  can be taken as small as one likes, and the
same bulk physics will result if one keeps mx = / constant, provided the dilaton is

assumed to be at at z = . thus, somewhat surprisingly, the operator ok  pi tr x 2

when added to the wilsonian action as a nite perturbation is eectively dimension
two.

the result mgap  mx is similar to what is found in the near-extremal d4-brane
approach to qcd4: there mgap  mfermions. it is rather dierent from the weak coupling
y m(cid:19) msoft. here b0 is the leading
result, where at one loop one expects mgap  exp(cid:18) 82
coecient in the beta function below the soft breaking scale:
if there are no matter
elds below this scale, then b0 = 11
3 n. mgap  mx renders comprehensible the
presence of glueballs with so(6) charge with mass comparable to the lowest neutral
glueball mass mgap: the masses of the so(6)-charged matter elds are comparable to
the qcd scale, so we should indeed expect to see so(6)-charged color singlet states
at that same scale, just as we see strange hadrons in the real world with masses on the
order of qcd.

it may seem that we have dropped the operator o8 from consideration prematurely:
a priori it seems plausible that the dual eld  might be the natural candidate for
triggering a dilaton prole.
inspection of the equations of motion (4) reveals that
this is not the case. in ve-dimensional einstein frame (and still with c = 0), the
 = 0 regardless of what  is doing. thus constant  is always
dilaton equation is
a solution. as one can verify from the absence of a  term in (6), the three point
function ho8o8o4i = 0, which is certainly consistent with the fact that ho8o8i is
independent of gy m if o8 is properly normalized. with  constant and  non-constant,
one could for example recover the full d3-brane metric. in [19] it was suggested that
in a particular large gsn, small  double scaling limit [20], the world-volume gauge
theory corresponding to the full d3-brane metric is

l = o4 + l4o8 ,

(31)

dened in a wilsonian sense at a cuto scale 1/l. as usual l is the radius of the s5 far
down the throat of the d3-brane. the second term in (31) was thought to characterize
the deviations of the geometry from ads5 s5 for radii r  l. in particular it seemed
to match the scaling form of corrections to the absorption cross-section of minimally
coupled scalars such as the dilaton [21].

6 discussion

to summarize our results, it is useful to draw a carter-penrose diagram of the spacetime
(13) (see gure 3). the conformal structure of the solution (13) is most obvious in the
original radial variable z. a light ray sent in from the boundary can get to the time-like
naked singularity and back in nite coordinate time t  l/b1/4  1/qcd.

the geometry deviates substantially from anti-de sitter space for   , where
24 e8 = 2. the location  =  in the bulk is where long wilson loops prefer to

run, and the refractive index n = n() dened in section 4 is what determines the
qcd string tension (that is, the coecient on the area law for the wilson loops). it
is straightforward to check that the glueball wavefunctions quickly become at to the
right of this radius in gure 3.

it is interesting to note that the supergravity approximation continues to be valid far
to the right of  in gure 3. supergravity is valid if the string coupling e is small and
the string frame curvature is much less than the string scale. the rst condition can
be arranged to hold as close to the singularity at z = z0 as desired, simply by choosing
gs = e suciently small. the second condition means that curvature invariants
such as r, rm n p qrm n p q, etc., computed in string frame, are much smaller than the
appropriate power of 1/. this will be true if

the line labeled string scale curvatures in gure 3 indicates the radius at which the

in section 5, we proposed to dene the theory at a cuto z = , corresponding to an
energy 1/, as n = 4 deformed by a so(6)-invariant scalar mass term m2
i .
the cuto served to give the massive bulk scalar eld k dual to this operator a denite
value, mx, at z = . this cuto can be removed, without altering the infrared physics,
in the following way: hold mx xed, send  gradually to zero, and at each successively
smaller value of  use the boundary conditions  =  and z = 0 at z = .

the infrared physics we found in section 4 was connement at a scale   mx. the
spectrum of massive excitations did not appear to be that of pure qcd, nor should it
be expected to, since the adjoint scalars have a mass on the order of the qcd scale.
the adjoint fermions also get a mass from radiative corrections which is probably also
comparable to . direct comparisons of this supergravity model or of the others that
have been proposed with pure yang-mills on the lattice seem doomed by the presence of
glueballs with charge under a global symmetry of the massive matter elds. it would
be more relevant, and more interesting, to compare the supergravity results with some
alternative analysis of a conning gauge theory coupled to adjoint matter elds with
masses on the order of the connement scale and some global avor symmetry. the
vexing kaluza-klein glueballs then have a sensible interpretation as avored hadrons.

when this work was near completion, we received [22], in which the solution described
in section 3 was independently obtained and some properties of wilson loops and the
running of the gauge coupling were discussed in the nearly anti-de sitter region.
