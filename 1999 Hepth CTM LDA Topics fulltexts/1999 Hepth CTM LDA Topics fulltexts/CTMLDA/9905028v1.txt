abstract

this paper is almost an exercise in which the hamiltonian scheme is de-

veloped for polyakovs classical string, by following the usual framework sug-

gested by dirac and bergman for the reduction of gauge theories to their

essential physical degrees of freedom. the results collected here will be use-

ful in some forthcoming papers, where strings will be studied in the unusual

context of wigner-covariant rest frame theory.

after a short introduction outlining the work, the lagrangean scheme is

presented in section ii, where the classical equivalence between polyakov and

nambu-goto string is rederived. in section iii the hamiltonian framework is

worked out, primary and secondary constraints are deduced. then lagrange

multipliers are introduced; nally the hamiltonian equations of motion are

presented.

in section iv gauge symmetries are treated, by constructing their canon-

ical generators; then some gauge degrees of freedom are eliminated by dirac-

bergmann xing procedure.

in this paper only the gauge-freedom coming

from primary constraints is xed, while secondary constraints will need a

deeper analysis. at the end of

1

section iv the classical version of virasoro algebra is singled out as that

of the secondary constraints, surviving to the rst gauge xing.

i. intoroduction.

in order to construct a good theory of relativistic insulated systems, formed by interacting

subsystems, we have chosen the framework of wigner-covariant rest frame scheme (see [3],

[4], [5], [6], [7], [8] [9], [10], [11]): in this context it is possible to handle relativistic covariance

in such a way that extended relativistic systems (like many body systems and elds) can

be treated in a self consistent one-time formulation; many advantages of this approach are

known: preservation of covariance in an easily controlled way, an easier form of the cluster

decomposition property, the prospect to use almost newtonian technologies. this line of

research follows the steps suggested many years ago by dirac [12], when he introduced a

space-like foliation of minkowski spacetime giving an invariant denition of simultaneity.

along this line of research many progresses have been achieved, some wigner-covariant

rest frame theories have already been formulated: that of n relativistic particles interacting

with an electromagnetic eld [3], the one of charged particles interacting via liendard-

wiechert potentials in the abelian as well as yang-mills case [6], that of a free dirac eld.

the next step weve been working on is the denition of canonical centerof-mass vs relative

variables for the elds [7], [8], [9], [11], so that particles and radiation will be treated in the

same way.

an interesting experiment will be the application of the same framework to relativistic

stringy objects, starting from classical nambu-goto string [2].

the motivation of this paper is essentially to review briey the classical mechanics of

polyakovs string, deriving its main features, by using dirac-bergman approach for singular

lagrangean systems [1]. the results here presented (which are not new, but are worked

out explicitly in a didactic feature) will be very useful in those forthcoming works about

nambu-goto string, whose dynamics is included in polyakovs theory.

polyakovs string classical theory is presented both in lagrangean as well as canonical

terms; primary and secondary constraints are singled out, their eects as canonical genera-

tors of classical gauge transformations are studied.

3

the main aim in this paper is to stress the canonical mechanism of generating virasoro

symmetries, in order to underline the background in which one has to move when discussing

dirac-bergman constraint reduction for the classical string [2].

with the simplest form of polyakovs action (omitting the liouville terms suggested in

[13] for sake of simplicity) the worldsheet metric hab (,  ) is pure gauge and it is possible

to gauge it away by using a suitable transformation generated by ab (,  ), the worldsheet

canonical momenta that are the primary constraints of this theory. stability conditions for

ab (,  ) leads to two secondary constraints, which are the virasoro constraints: here they

are introduced as those symmetries surviving after conformal gauge-xing the metric on the

worlsheet.

ii. lagrangean framework.

well work with a bosonic string described by polyakovs action and embedded in a

minkowskian at spacetime md of signature (1, d  1). the action is:

s = 

t
2

z dz dhhabax bx .

(2.1)

string motion is the evolution of the following lagrangean coordinates

x  () , hab ()

with respect to the scalar parameter  .

our point of view is to consider x  and hab as classical elds in the curved 1 + 1

background spanned by (,  ), referred to as world sheet v2: the freely chosen v2 coordinates

will be scalars under spacetime poincare transformation.

there exists a worldsheet tensor calculus derived from the 1 + 1 metric hab, with metric-

adapted connections, covariant derivatives, parallel transport and so on, while tensor calculus

is trivial for the spacetime (which is at).

the only relationship between worldsheet geometry and spacetime is that in order for

4

string motion to have a causal coherence, the v2-tangent vectors will be one spacelike and

one timelike:

  x  x  < 0, x x  > 0,

(2.2)

(the spacetime metric is  = (+1,1,1,1)) and this allows us to assign the conditions

x (, 0) = x0 () ,  x (, 0) = v0 ()

as well posed initial values.

we will refer to the following quantity

l = 

t
2

z dhhabax bx 

(2.3)

(2.4)

as the string lagrangean, which can be evaluated integrating the lagrangean linear density

along the string.

with the positions

l = 

t
2

hhabax bx 

 x = x, x = x,

the lagrangean can be rewritten as

l = 

t
2

z dh(cid:16)h  x  x  + 2h  x x + hxx(cid:17) ,

while its linear density reads:

h(cid:16)h  x  x  + 2h  x x + hxx(cid:17) .
since the worldsheet signature is (1, 1) the factor h is the square root of

l = 

t
2

from binet theorem

h =  det khabk .

5

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

det(cid:13)(cid:13)hab(cid:13)(cid:13) =

1

det khabk

1
h  h =

= 

1

(h )2  h  h

,

(2.9)

and so:

l = 

t 

2q(h )2  h  h (cid:16)h  x  x  + 2h  x x + hxx(cid:17) .

(2.10)

we will need this form for l later. we shall work out the lagrangean framework treating
x and h as independent variables.

the metric will obey the following lagrangean equations

a

l

 (ax ) 

l
x  = 0, a

l

 (ahbc) 

l
hbc = 0,

and from (2.5) we get:

and even:

l

 (ax )

= thax,

l
x  = 0,

a

l

 (ahbc)

= 0,

l
hbc = 

th
2 (cid:18)bx cx 

hbc
2

hef ex f x(cid:19) ;

so we will write:

a(cid:16)hax(cid:17) = 0, bx cx 

hbc
2

hef ex f x = 0.

let us explicit the rst equation to get1:

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

aax =

1
2

hcdahcdax, bx cx 

hbc
2

hef ex f x = 0.

(2.15)

first let us focus the relationship

1here the relationship

is usually employed.



hcd

h = 

1
2

hhcd,

(2.14)

6

bx cx 

hbc
2

hef ex f x = 0,

which is simply euler-lagrange equation for the metric: with the position

it reads:

gbc = bx cx

gbc =

hbc
2

hef gef =

hbc
2

trkgk ,

and from the equation of motion

we get:

gbc =

hbc
2

trkgk

det kgk =

(trkgk)2

4

det khk .

the absolute value of (2.19) is

which becomes

g =

(trkgk)2

4

h,

g =

h,

trkgk

2

and writing trkgk in more explicit form as in (2.17)

one recognizes:

trkgk = habax bx

g =

h
2

habax bx.

so euler-lagrange equation for the independent variable metric hab reads:

h
2

habax bx = g, gbc = bx cx,

7

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

which translates (2.1) into plain nambu-goto action:

s = t z dz dg.

(2.25)

nambu-goto action is obtained from polyakovs (2.1) using euler-lagrange equations for

the worldsheet metric.

action (2.25) does really be nambu-goto action, i.e. t times the measure of v2,

considering

mis v2 =z dz dg,

(2.26)

that is just considering sheet-tensor gbc = bx cx as the worldsheet metric. so we have

to choose the option:

hbc = gbc  hbc = bx cx .

(2.27)

equation (2.27) simply embeds v2 into md. one can nd [14] very simply the generalization

to general relativistic free falling string, moving on a rigid background g (x).

when written explicitly, nambu-goto action reads

x  xxx (cid:16) x x(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

,

x  xxx (cid:16) x x(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(2.28)

(2.29)

and so lagrangean linear density is:

sng = t z dz dr(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
lng = tr(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

the fact that nambu-goto theory is included in polyakovs one will let us use the content

of this paper in [2].

finally, lets consider euler-lagrange equations of motion for the string variables:

aax =

1
2

hcdahcdax.

(2.30)

8

iii. hamiltonian framework.

lets organize an hamiltonian scheme for the classical free string, described by (2.1),

whose lagrangean linear density is:

l = 

t 

2q(h )2  h  h (cid:16)h  x  x  + 2h  x x + hxx(cid:17) .

the x and the h variables will be thought of as independent.

(3.1)

a. primary constraints and constraintless hamiltonian.

to realize a canonical version of the theory described by (3.1) well have to evaluate

canonical momenta of string variables

as well as of sheet variables

p =

l
 x 

ab =

l
 hab

,

assuming equal time poisson brackets:




since

{x  (,  ) , p (,  )} = 

  (  ) ,

1

c b

d + a

(cid:8)hab (,  ) , cd (,  )(cid:9) =
c(cid:1)  (  ) ,
{x  (,  ) , x  (,  )} = {p (,  ) , p (,  )} = 0,

2(cid:0)a

db

(cid:8)hab (,  ) , hcd (,  )(cid:9) = {ab (,  ) , cd (,  )} = 0.

l

 (ahbc)

= 0

9

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

canonical momenta ab vanish identically, so the theory from (3.1) is a constrained one, with

primary constraints:

due to the symmetry

ab  0.

hbc = hcb

(3.6)

the independent primary constraints are of course only three, for example the following ones:

   0,    0,   0,

(3.7)

and form a rst class set, as prescribed by (3.4). these constraints are strongly rst class, be-

cause of assumptions (3.4). well rst build up the constraintless part of the hamiltonian,

then well include constraints with lagrange multipliers.

string variables x have nonvanishing momenta:

p = th(cid:16)h  x + h x(cid:17) .

from (3.8) one can read back x in terms of p, obtaining:

x = 

1

t h h

p 

h 
h 

x.

(3.8)

(3.9)

with (3.8) and (3.9) were ready to write down the constraintless hamiltonian density:

h0 = q(h )2  hh 

2t h 

p p 

h 
h 

p x 

t

2 q(h )2  hh 

h

(3.10)

the whole constraintless hamiltonian is obtained integrating h0 along the string, and it
reads:

h0 =

p x +

(lets remember equation (2.9)).

(3.11)

b. secondary constraints.

lets work out stability conditions for our primary constraints (3.6). we could use the

equations

{ab, hc}  0

(where hc is the canonical hamiltonian obtained from h0 adding a linear combination of

primary constraints (3.7)), but there exist an easier method2 which can be employed when

some constraints are canonical momenta: from euler-lagrange equations

a

l

 (ahbc) 

l
hbc = 0

one can see that canonical momenta obey

which is

ab =

l
hab  

l

 (hab)

,

ab =

l
hab

(3.12)

(3.13)

for us, due to equation (3.5). this is why we read stability conditions of (3.7) from the

equations:

l
h   0,

l
h   0,

l
h  0.

(3.14)

remembering equation (2.13)
th
2 (cid:18)bx cx 

l
hbc = 

hbc
2

hef ex f x(cid:19) ,

we translate conditions (3.7) into the following system:

2this method is reliable only if one assumes lagrangian and hamiltonian motions completely

equivalent.

11

x  x 

h 
2

hef ex f x  0,

x x 

h 
2

hef ex f x  0,

xx 

h
2

hef ex f x  0.

(3.15)




we have to use the expressions for x  in terms of p  and those of inverted metric hab in

terms of hef.

the inversion of the matrix

h  h 

h  h 
hab = 


hh  hh  


hh hh 

,

hab =


h  = hh, h  = hh , h = hh  .

leads to

i.e.:

so we get:

x  x +

hh

2

hef ex f x  0,

x x 

hh 

2

hef ex f x  0,

xx +

hh 

2

hef ex f x  0.




(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

these constraints are not completely independent, they must be reduced to a set of two

independent ones only. in order to do this, well employ the trace hef ex f x in the role of

a parameter, obtaining a system which is equivalent to (3.18) but simpler than it, coupling

together the equations two by two. from the rst equation we have hef ex f x as

12

hef ex f x  

2

hh

x  x

and putting it into the second one3:

x x +

h 
h

x  x  0

involving only coordinates and canonical momenta, it reads:

(3.19)

(3.20)

 

2 (h )2

t h (h  )2 h 

1

t h h! px +  (h )3

h (h  )2 

h 

h ! xx +

h 
h

p p

t 2 (h  )2 h  0.
(3.21)

lets put together rst and third equation in (3.18): we get hef ex f x from the rst

(as in (3.19)) and put it into the third

xx 

h 
h

x  x  0,

getting something which becomes

 1 

(h )2

hh ! xx 

1

t 2hh  h

p p 

2h 

t hh h

p x  0

considering (3.9).

(3.22)

(3.23)

finally, lets put together the second and the third equations in (3.18): now hef ex f x

comes from the third equation4

hef ex f x  

2

hh 

xx

and it is put into the second one

x x +

h 
h 

xx  0,

(3.24)

(3.25)

3we work like this in order to never divide by the o-diagonal component h , since by its

symmetry the metric tensor is point-by-point diagonalizable, and it must be possible to put h  = 0

as gauge xing without any unpleasant divergency.

4...always in order to never have h  as a divider!

13

which is translated into an expression involving only coordinates and momenta:

1

t h h



px  0.

(3.26)

now we have only to put together constraints (3.21), (3.23) and (3.26) to get secondary

constraints ensuring stability of the primary ones:

 

2 (h )2

t h (h  )2 h 

1

t h h! px +  (h )3

h (h  )2 

h 

h ! xx +

h

1

t 2hh  h

p p 

2h 

t hh h

p x  0,

1

t h h



px  0.

(3.27)




the third one, which reads equally px  0 since
the other two of (3.27). the equivalent system of stability condition is:

t h h

1

never vanishes, can be used in

  (h )3
h (h  )2

 1 

(h )2

hh ! xx 

1

t 2hh  h

p p  0,

(3.28)

px  0.




we can work on the rst line, getting

h 

h  " 1 

(h )2

hh ! xx 

1

t 2hh  h

p p#  0

and, since h  must be considered free, well hold the constraint:

 1 

(h )2

hh ! xx 

1

t 2hh  h

p p  0.

the independent array of secondary constraints, allowing stability for (3.6), becomes:

14

 1 

(h )2

hh ! xx 

1

t 2hh  h

p p  0, px  0.

(3.29)

well use the following symbols

1 = px,  = 1 

(h )2

hh ! xx 

1

t 2hh  h

p p

(3.30)

for sake of simplicity. in this language, its possible to render the stability conditions clearer,

replacing  with a simpler function of p and x: in fact, from (2.9) one writes:

 =

det(cid:13)(cid:13)hab(cid:13)(cid:13)
hh  (cid:18) 1

t 2

p p + xx(cid:19) .

since hab is nonsingular, one recognizes that  vanishes if and only if

where

2  0,

2 (p, x) =

1
t 2

p p + xx

and one can use the following system of primary plus secondary constraints

   0,    0,   0, 1 (p, x)  0, 2 (p, x)  0.

(3.31)

(3.32)

(3.33)

(3.34)

c. stability and lagrange multipliers.

now one has to go on to work out the stability conditions for the whole set of constraints,

checking their consistency with the motion generated by the canonical hamiltonian linear

density

hc = 

f [h]
2t

p p 

t
2

f [h] xx 

h 
h 

p x +     +    + ,

(3.35)

obtained by adding to the constraintless hamiltonian (3.10) a linear combination of con-

straints with the lagrange multipliers. in (3.35) we put:

15

f [h] = q(h )2  h  h

h 

(3.36)

for simplicity.

in order to look for stability conditions of constraints, its better to express even the

constraintless part in terms of the very constraints. its easy to recognize:

h0 = 

h 
h 

1 

t
2

f [h] 2.

thus the linear density for the canonical hamiltonian is:

hc =     +    +  

h 
h 

1 

t
2

f [h] 2.

the scalar canonical hamiltonian reduces to a linear combination of constraints.

when (3.34) are fullled, one has:

hc  0.

(3.37)

(3.38)

this is exactly what happens in the relativistic free classical particle, where hc =
 (pp  m2)  0.

with the hamiltonian

hc =



z0

d(cid:18)    +    +  

h 
h 

1 

t
2

f [h] 2(cid:19)

were ready to work out stability conditions using:

{ab, hc}  0,

{1, hc}  0,

{2, hc}  0.

(3.39)

(3.40)

first of all, its necessary to produce the poisson bracket algebra of the constraints, where

(3.4) are supposed to be fullled a priori.

the formal denition of equal time poisson bracket between to quantities a [x, p, h, ]

and b [x, p, h, ] is:

16

{a ( ) ,b ( )} =

=



z0

+



z0

d(cid:20) a ( )

x  (,  )

b ( )
p (,  ) 

a ( )
p (,  )

x  (,  )(cid:21) +
b ( )

(3.41)

d(cid:20) a ( )

hab (,  )

b ( )
ab (,  ) 

a ( )
ab (,  )

hab (,  )(cid:21) ,
b ( )

where functional derivatives are dened `a la frechet [11]. in particular one gets:

{ab (,  ) ,f} = 

f

hab (,  )

(3.42)

from (3.41), for any f [x, p, h, ].

the rst three constraints are directly postulated to be strongly in involution with each

other

{ab (,  ) , cd (,  )} = 0.

(3.43)

poisson bracketing the momenta ab with k we simply get zero, since k are string-

dependent only:

{ab (,  ) , 1 (,  )} = 0, {ab (,  ) , 2 (,  )} = 0.

poisson brackets between ks are evaluated by using the relation




 (  ) = 




 (  )

(thats a distributional equality, i.e.

z f () d




 (  ) = z f () d




 (  )  f ),

and read:

(3.44)

(3.45)

17

{1 (,  ) , 2 (,  )} = 2(cid:20) 1

t 2

p  () p () + x () x ()(cid:21) 



 (  ) ,

{1 (,  ) , 1 (,  )} = [x (,  ) p  (,  ) + x (,  ) p  (,  )]




 (  ) ,

{2 (,  ) , 2 (,  )} =

4
t 2 [x () p  () + x () p  ()]




 (  ) .

they mean that those poisson brackets are weakly zero, since from dirac function properties

one discovers:

f ()




 (  ) =




[f ()  (  )]   (  )




f ()

(3.46)

which leads to

{1 (,  ) , 2 (,  )} = 2

{1 (,  ) , 1 (,  )} = 2







[2 ()  (  )]  2 (  )

[1 ()  (  )]  2 (  )







2 () ,

1 () ,

(3.47)

{2 (,  ) , 2 (,  )} =

8
t 2




[1 ()  (  )] 

8
t 2

 (  )




1 ()

in our specic case. so one can recognize:







{ab (,  ) , cd (,  )} = 0,

{ab (,  ) , i (,  )}  0,

{1 (,  ) , 2 (,  )}  0,

(3.48)

{1 (,  ) , 1 (,  )}  0, {2 (,  ) , 2 (,  )}  0.




from the nature of hc (thats made of constraints only) one can consider stability

conditions (3.40) fullled. in fact, if we evaluate poisson bracket of a constraint, say ,

with the product f []  (which hc is made of), we get:

{, f [] } = f []{, } +  {, f []}  0,

as it was to be shown.

18

d. hamiltonian equations of motion.

here we work out, for sake of completeness, the hamiltonian equations of motion for sheet

variables as well as string variables, and this could be done simply by using the canonical

hamiltonian linear density

hc = abba 

h 
h 

1 

t
2

f [h] 2,

(3.49)

which includes primary constraints only. secondary constraints can be added as well (as

hennaux and teitelboim suggest in [1]), getting the extended hamiltonian

he = abba +(cid:18)1 

h 

h (cid:19) 1 +(cid:18)2 

t
2

f [h](cid:19) 2 :

(3.50)

generating the motion with this he its more evident how the presence of secondary con-
straints renders ambiguous the motion of p and x within the coordinate-momenta manifold.

in terms of poisson brackets, hamiltonian equations of motion read:

hab =(cid:8)hab, h(cid:9) ,
x  = {x , h} ,

p  = {p , h} ,
where h is obtained by integrating (3.49) along the string,

ab = {ab, h} ,

(3.51)








hab =(cid:8)hab, hc(cid:9) ,
x  = {x , hc} ,

ab = {ab, hc} ,

p  = {p , hc} ,

or (3.50)

hab =(cid:8)hab, he(cid:9) ,
x  = {x , he} ,
well use directly the extended hamiltonian

ab = {ab, he} ,

p  = {p , he} .

19

he =z d(cid:20)abba +(cid:18)1 

h 

h (cid:19) 1 +(cid:18)2

f [h](cid:19) 2(cid:21)

(3.52)

and well consider the rules (3.4) and (4.38).

sheet variables obey the following equations

hab (,  ) =

1

2(cid:2)ab (,  ) + ba (,  )(cid:3) ,

but the symmetry ba = ab allows only the symmetric part of ab take part to the play, so

that:

hab (,  ) = ab (,  ) .

(3.53)

the former expresses physical emptiness of hab: it can be used to invert equation (3.3), and

gives us an idea of arbitrariness of hab motion.

hamiltons equations for sheet momenta are:

ab (,  )  0,
and represent the stability of ab as constraints.

lets deal with string variables; the lagrangean coordinates obey to:

(3.54)

x (,  ) =(cid:18)1 (,  ) 

h  (,  )

h  (,  )(cid:19) x (,  ) +(cid:18)22 (,  )

t 2

f [h (,  )]

t



(cid:19) p (,  ) . (3.55)

this represents the inversion formula for (3.2), in which lagrange multipliers 1 (,  ) and

2 (,  ) appear: equation (3.55) does coincide with (3.9) when multipliers are chosen to

vanish.

the real physically meaningful equation of motion for the string variables constructed

with extended hamiltonian is anyway that of p :

p (,  ) =

=(cid:20)1 (,  ) 



 (cid:18) h  (,  )

h  (,  )(cid:19)(cid:21) p (,  ) +(cid:18)1 (,  ) 

h  (,  )

h  (,  )(cid:19) p  (,  ) +

(3.56)

+ (22 (,  )  t f  [h (,  )]) x (,  ) + (22 (,  )  t f [h (,  )]) x (,  ) .

lagrange multipliers appear here too, with their degree of arbitrariness.

20

iv. symmetries and constraints.

lets now analyze the meaning of constraints shown by polyakovs string, treating them

as canonical generators of gauge transformations.

a. gauge transformations for sheet variables.

the physical system with action

s = 

t

2 z dz dhhabax bx

(4.1)

shows ve rst class constraints

   0,

   0,

p x  0,

p p
t 2 + xx  0,




  0,
three primary and two secondary.

since the canonical momenta of variables hab representing the worldsheet metric are

constraints, these variables are functions of  and  which can be arbitrarily changed at

each instant of the motion, without changing the physical state of the system. in particular,

weve already shown in (3.53) that legendre transformations from hab to ab must be inverted

inserting arbitrary scalar functions of  .

its possible to use this arbitrariness aecting hab by operating some gauge xing in order

to make simpler the string description: well now perform this gauge-xing.

this operation needs some mathematical conditions: gauge xing is the position of some

conditions5

5...which must fulll [1]:

21

lets start with a particular metric conguration

cn(cid:2)hab(cid:3) = 0.

hab = hab

(4.3)

(4.4)

being hab assigned, and lets look for the ef -generated transformation leading to the wanted

form hab
0 .

lets dene the functional derivative dierential operator ef , acting on quantities de-

pending from sheet variables, such that:

ef ()f [h] = {f [h] , ef ()} ,

(4.5)

and lets appreciate:

ef () f [h] =

f [h]
hef ()

.

we can thus use the operator identication:

ef () =



hef ()

.

(4.6)

 accessibility:

from the original form of hab it must be possible to reach a new form hab
0

identically satisfying (4.3). this must be done with a sequence of transformations generated

by suitable second class constraints, ab in our present case.

 completeness: relationships (4.3) must completely x the gauge, i.e. the form of hab

0 weve

given the sheet variables must be uninvariant under those transformations of the gauge we

wanted to x; in particular this condition is formulated as

ncnhhabi , efo 6= 0,

(4.2)

in terms of poisson brackets.

22

any innitesimal element of ef-algebra

will cause a transformation

z ef () ef () d

f [h]  f [h] + f [h]

on any functional f [h], such that:

f [h] =z ef () {f [h] , ef ()} d.

this will be applied in the form (4.6), getting:

f [h] =z def ()

f [h]
hef ()

.

innitesimal variation on the metric is then:

hab () = ab () .

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

equations (4.7) and (4.8) can be extended to nite forms, simply by exponentiating the

innitesimal version:

f  [h] = f [h] +

+

xn=1

1

n!(cid:18)z def ()



hef ()(cid:19)n

f [h] ,

i.e.:

f  =(cid:20)exp(cid:18)z def ()



hef ()(cid:19)(cid:21)f .

(4.10)

(4.11)

these canonical generators can be very easily exponentiated, since their bracket algebra is

trivial. the fact that their algebra is abelian will be a key point all over our discussion6.

when we work with functions from r into r we have

6of course one should be careful about the convergence of the integrals involved; we will not be

so careful here, this paper is simply intended to be a solved exercise!

23

where:

(daf ) (y) = f (y + a) .

da =

1
n!

+

xn=0

ann
x ,

and a is a xed real number. the following mathematical object

d = exp(cid:18)z def ()



hef ()(cid:19)

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

is a thing much more sophisticated than da, here we make functional derivatives, and have to

deal with an innite number of degrees of freedom... anyway, we still exponentiate abelian

operators



hef () , with coecients ef () which are functionally constant with respect to the

variables hef (). we arrive to the nave conclusion:

f  [h] = df [h]  f  [h] = f [h + ] .

(4.15)

metric sheet tensor changes from h into h + , so that if we want to go from hab to hab
0

fullling (4.3) it will be possible to do it by that d with

ef () = hef

0 ()  hef () .

(4.16)

b. some interesting functionals.

so our system is described by a linear canonical hamiltonian density

hc =     +    +  

h 
h 

1 

t
2

f [h] 2,

(4.17)

where f [h] is dened in (3.36). there are ve rst class constraints, three involving only

sheet variables

   0,    0,   0,

(4.18)

and two involving only string variables:

24

p x  0,

p p
t 2 + xx  0.

(4.19)

from singular lagrangean system theory [1], one knows that rst class constraints are

gauge transformation generators, which change in a  -dependent way the formal motion

through the phase space, without changing the physical state of the system. here well

underline which transformation is generated by each constraint.

the action (2.1) shows lots of symmetries.

it is invariant under the worldsheet

reparametrizations

 =  (,  ) ,

 =  (,  )

(dieomophic maps from v2 into v2), as well as under weyl transformations

hab (,  ) =  (,  ) hab (,  ) .

(4.20)

(4.21)

the term habax bx  is di-invariant since the sheet-tensor indices are all correctly

saturated; moreover the measure

d2v = d dh

is notoriously a di-invariant one, so s does be.

we have

h (h)ab = hhab

(4.22)

(4.23)

changing the metric as suggested in (4.21), while  t
by weyl transformation (4.21), so that s in invariant under local rescaling too.

2  d dax bx  is really unaected

we can try to understand these symmetries in terms of transformations generated by

the rst class constraints (4.18) and (4.19). we have to be particularly careful with dif-

feomorphisms, because the constraints act only on the elds h, , x and p , not on the

v2-coordinates directly; we can still map reparametrizations (4.20) into the corresponding

transformations which aect the elds as a consequence of those coordinate changes. for

25

example, letting a be any old worldsheet variable and a any new one, we can still

recognize:

hab =

a
c

b
d

hcd, cd =

a
c

b
d

ab, x = x, p  = p.

(4.24)

lets deal with sheet constraints (4.18); from:

{ab (,  ) ,f} = 

f

hab (,  )

(4.25)

its easy to regard ab as the canonical generators of translations along hab (,  ). lets

use these sheet constraints to realize weyl rescaling generators.

one has to get

hab (,  ) = e(, )hab (,  )

(4.26)

on sheet variables, while nothing has to happen to the string variables.

lets consider an o () version of (4.26)

hab (,  ) = [1 +  (,  ) + ...] hab (,  ) ,

so that the sheet metric tensor changes as:

hab = hab.

the innitesimal generator of these transformations is a functional w such that:

lets try the function

hab =(cid:8)hab,w(cid:9) .

w (,  ) =  (,  ) hab (,  ) ba (,  )

with   c (v2, r); one has:

(cid:8)hef (,  ) , w (,  )(cid:9) =  (,  ) hef (,  )  (  ) .

we get the right functional if we dene

26

(4.27)

(4.28)

(4.29)

(4.30)

w [h, ] =



z0

and obtain:

 (,  ) hab (,  ) ba (,  ) d

(4.31)

(cid:8)hef (,  ) ,w(cid:9) =  (,  ) hef (,  ) ,

(4.32)

which authorizes us to state:

 w [h, ] is the canonical generator of weyl rescalings.

its interesting to nd that weyl invariance of the classical theory is related to the

energy-stress sheet tensor of the string. let us dene that tensor as in [15]

tab = 

2
th

l
hab ;

than let us assume the primary constraints

ab  0 :

the derivative

thus becomes:

w = habba +  habba + hab ba,

w  hab ba.

(4.33)

(4.34)

(4.35)

the condition in order for w  0 to be fullled (that is: in order for the weyl generating
charge w to be conserved, and so for the theory to be consistently weyl-invariant) is

which becomes

ba = 0,

l
hba = 0

27

due to the lagrange equations (2.11) and lagrangean singularity (3.5). from (4.33) one

gets:

w (,  )  

t

2ph (,  ) (,  ) hab (,  ) tba (,  )    c (v2, r) ,

(4.36)

which allows the adrmation: the vanishing of stress-energy tensor trace is the condition

for the local rescaling weyl transformations to be symmetries of the theory, because its the

condition for w to be constant.

lets now deal with string variable constraints, those ks dened as follows:

1 = p x, 2 =

p p
t 2 + xx.

(4.37)

first of all, regarding them as canonical generators of gauge transformations acting on string

variables, we obtain7:

{x (,  ) , 1 (,  )} = x (,  )  (  ) ,

{p (,  ) , 1 (,  )} = p (,  )   (  ) ,

{x (,  ) , 2 (,  )} =

2
t 2

p (,  )  (  ) ,

{p (,  ) , 2 (,  )} = 2x (,  )   (  ) .

(4.38)




the only very understandable formula in (4.38) is the rst one

{x (,  ) , 1 (,  )} = x (,  )  (  ) ,

7since p and x havent zero poisson brackets with these constraints 1 and 2, they arent gauge-

invariant at all: if one wanted to get really gauge-invariant variables for the string, one should make

one more canonical transformation, that is one more dirac-bergman reduction. this will be tried

in [2].

28

which regards 1 as a canonical generator of translations along .

in fact, dening the

quantity

df ( ) =z f (,  ) 1 (,  ) d

and then using it to transform canonically string variable x (,  ), we deduce

{x (,  ) , df ( )} = f (,  ) x (,  ) :

this is typically the action of the canonical generator of the transformation

(4.39)

(4.40)

 = ,

 =  + f (,  ) ,

always thinking of f (,  ) as an innitesimal function.

such a polite relationship is rather dicult to single out for the other equations (4.38):

less cumbersome, more encouraging results are obtained by combining functionally the ks.

for example, using the following functional

mf ( ) = z f (,  )" h  (,  )

h  (,  )

1 (,  ) +

as a canonical generator, the following result is obtained

t

2h  (,  )ph (,  )

2 (,  )# d

(4.41)

{x (,  ) , mf ( )} = f (,  ) x (,  ) ,

(4.42)

while when mf ( ) acts on the canonical momentum p (,  ) it yields:

{p (,  ) , mf ( )} = "f (,  )  h  (,  )

h  (,  )

p (,  ) +

t

2h  (,  )ph (,  )

x (,  )!#

(4.43)

(these are both worked out using (3.8) and (3.9) equations).

c. conformal gauge xing.

in order to render

29

s = 

t

2 z dz dh(cid:16)h  x  x + 2h  x x + hxx(cid:17)

simpler, wed like to get a diagonal sheet metric.

lets use the following gauge xing

hab  ab = 0,

(4.44)

where ab is simply the minkowskian 1 + 1 metric. since we want to get the conguration

(4.45)

.

(4.46)

well have to choose a transformation (4.14) with coecients:

0 (cid:13)(cid:13) =
(cid:13)(cid:13)hab

(cid:13)(cid:13)ab(cid:13)(cid:13) =


1  h  h 
h 

1 0
0 1



1  h 


this gauge xing is possible, since (4.46) is always an admitted choice; moreover, gauge

xing (4.44) is complete, since its unstable under further ef -generated transformation be-

cause:

(cid:8)hab (,  )  ab, ef (,  )(cid:9) =

1

2(cid:0)a

e b

f + a

f b

e(cid:1)  (  ) 6= 0.

(4.47)

from now on well always work in the conformal gauge, as the condition (4.44) is referred

to. polyakovs action becomes:

s =

t

2 z dz d(cid:16) x  x  xx(cid:17) .

well gauge out the gauge degrees of freedom related to the constraints

   0,    0,   0,

since by the conformal xing

h  + 1 = 0, h  = 0, h  1 = 0

30

(4.48)

(4.49)

(4.50)

rst class set (4.49) will be changed into a second class set, adding the (cid:0)hab  ab(cid:1)s:

   0,    0,   0, h  + 1  0, h   0, h  1  0.

(4.51)

its possible to read as strong equations these (4.51), using suitable dirac brackets instead

of usual symplectic product (3.41).

the symplectic matrix of the second class constraints is dened as:




c (, ) =

and reads:

{  () , h  () + 1} {  () , h  ()} {  () , h ()  1}
{  () , h  () + 1} {  () , h  ()} {  () , h ()  1}
{ () , h  () + 1} { () , h  ()} { () , h ()  1}

, (4.52)




c (, ) = 

its inverse matrix has the same form:

 (  )

c1 (, ) = 

 (  ) .

1 0 0

0 1 0

0 0 1

1 0 0

0 1 0

0 0 1











dirac brackets are dened as follows:

{f ,g} = {f ,g} z dz d {f , a ()}(cid:0)c1 (, )(cid:1)ab {b () ,g} ,

where a are (4.51) constraints, with a from 1 to 6; from the form

(cid:0)c1 (, )(cid:1)ab

= ab (  ) ,

we immediately get:

{f ,g} = {f ,g} +

6

xa=1z d {f , a ()} {a () ,g} .

explicitly:

31

(4.53)

(4.54)

(4.55)

(4.56)

(4.57)

{f ,g} = {f ,g} +

+z d {f ,   ()}{  () ,g} +z d {f ,   ()}{  () ,g} +
+z d {f ,  ()} { () ,g} +z d {f , h  ()}{h  () ,g}
+z d {f , h  ()} {h  () ,g} +z d {f , h ()} {h () ,g} .

since dirac bracketing allows us to write

(4.58)

a (,  ) = 0

strongly, we can directly modify quantities involving the gauged out constraints. from string

velocity to string momentum now we go by:

and come back by:

p = t x

x =

p
t

,

which replace (3.8) and (3.9) respectively.

linear canonical hamiltonian density becomes:

hc =

p p

2t

+

t
2

xx,

and the extended correspondent:

he = 1p x +(cid:18)2 +

t

2(cid:19)(cid:18) p p

t 2 + xx(cid:19) .

(4.59)

(4.60)

(4.61)

(4.62)

surviving constraints involving p and x are left formally invariant, while their expressions

in terms of

x and x change as:

x x  0,

x  x + xx  0.

(4.63)

32

dirac symplectic product among string variables reads:

nx  (,  ) ,

x (,  )o = t 

  (  ) .

(4.64)

from now on, well write this relationship without the asterisk  (which was there to remind

us that a gauge reduction took place).

the equation of motion (3.56) due to the canonical hamiltonian is modied as

that is:

p = t x,

x  x = 0.

working with the extended hamiltonian (4.62) we would get

x  1

x  1 x  2

2
t

x (cid:18)2

2
t

+ 1(cid:19) x = 0.

(4.65)

(4.66)

(4.67)

after deciding the conformal gauge (4.44) to be used from here on, lets show that its

conclusions are coherent with whats been discovered within lagrangean framework. there

(in (2.13)) it was stressed that euler-lagrange equations for hab led to:

hbc =  bx cx ,

(4.68)

i.e. the sheet metric from lagrangean equations was shown to be that of v2 when embedded

into md. this spacetime is at, anyway, and has  as metric tensor, so we have:

h  = x 2, h = (x)2 , h  = x  x.

(4.69)

constraints (4.63) simply tell us that the choice

h  = 1, h = +1, h  = 0

is admitted, consistently with (4.68) and (4.69).

33

d. surviving gauge symmetries.

lets deal with the string theory in which the sheet constraints ab  0 have been gauged
away by the position (4.44): now weve not any more ve constraints, but only two rst

class ones (the weakly vanishing 1 and 2).

this new theory still shows all the symmetries generated by the two surviving constraints:

p x  0,

p p
t 2 + xx  0.

(4.70)

constraints (4.70) generate canonically all the worldsheet transformations which leave the

conformal action

unchanged.

s =

t

2 z dz dh x 2  (x)2i

(4.71)

in this paragraph we want to show that those gauge transformations which survive after

the gauge-xing (4.44) can be rewritten producing the very well known virasoro algebra:

due to this fact, string theory will be interpreted as a conformal eld theory, thats one of

its most pregnant property.

1. stress-energy tensor.

the rst thing we want to stress is the meaning of the quantities 1 and 2 in the

conformal gauge weve chosen; they correspond to the stress-energy tensor components,

dened as follows [15]:

tab () = 

2
th

s

hab(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h=

.

(4.72)

in order to evaluate this tab () its necessary to use the still gauge-unxed polyakovs action

(2.1), compute the derivatives of (4.72), and nally restrict ourselves to the conformal choice

for the gauge. the tensor is evaluated as

tab (h) = ax bx 

1
2

hab(cid:0)hef ex f x(cid:1) .

34

(4.73)

in the conformal gauge the latter becomes:

tab () = ax bx +

1
2

ab(cid:16) x 2  (x)2(cid:17) .

(4.74)

when conformally gauge-xed, the stress-energy tensor elements are the very constraints 1

and 2 which survive the gauge-xing as further symmetries:

t  () =

1

2(cid:16) x 2 + (x)2(cid:17) , t () =

1

2(cid:16) x 2 + (x)2(cid:17) , t  () = x  x,

that is

t  () = 1, t  () = t () =

1
2

2.

so within the conformal gauge the theory shows the following constraints:

omitting the gauge-xing symbol ().

tab  0,

(4.75)

(4.76)

(4.77)

this tensor tab is interesting, because it corresponds in general to the sheet stress-energy

tensor, that is to (1 + 1)-current which describes the ux of canonical - and  -translation

generators along the worldsheet, during the motion of x  (,  ). this is deduced from the

application of noethers theorem to polyakovs lagrangean density.

the sheet densities of the canonical generators of translations along  and  are

a =  x ax +

1
2



a(cid:16) x 2  (x)2(cid:17) ,

where a = , , and the current density of the a-th canonical generator simply is:

ja = xax +

1
2



a(cid:16) x 2  (x)2(cid:17) .

its easy to show that the equation

a + ja = ax (cid:16) x  x(cid:17)

(4.78)

(4.79)

(4.80)

is fullled by a and ja, which becomes a continuity equation a + ja = 0 when equations

of motion (4.66) are considered. so one can write

35

a + ja

= 0.

(4.81)

the canonical generators of sheet translations are obtained from  and  integrating along

the string at xed  , and are:

q =z dt 

 (,  ) , q =z dt 

 (,  ) .

continuity laws (4.81) allow the relationships

q = 0,

q = 0

to hold along the string motion.

lets turn for a moment to equations (4.75): from them one can derive

 = 

1
2

2,  = 1;

(4.82)

(4.83)

(4.84)

this makes  and  have zero poisson brackets. moreover, since the canonical hamiltonian

is (see equation (4.61))

hc =

t
2

2

(4.85)

its to be expected that q and q are constant along the motion.

the matrix of the sheet stress-energy tensor tab contains the constraints ks:

ktabk = 


1
2 2 1

1

1
2 2

.




the weak vanishing of tab components is completely equivalent to that of ks, while their

linear combination

tabhba  0

(4.86)

vanishes as a stability condition for weyls rescaling invariance of polyakovs action, as it is

shown by equation (4.36).

36

2. virasoro algebra.

theres a local conservation law

atab = 0

(4.87)

to which tensor tab undergoes, and it allows us to build up an innite number of conserved

quantities for polyakovs string motion. all these quantities form the poisson algebra of the

rich group of conformal transformations, the very gauge symmetries generated by ks.

first of all, we have to extend string variables between  =  and  = 0 in order to

produce those conserved quantities; an even extension is introduced for the velocity

x (,  ) = x (,  ) ,

while gradients must undergo to an odd extension:

x (,  ) = x (,  ) .

lets then consider a smooth function

f  c ([, ] , c)

and dene the following functional of secondary constraints:

l [f ] =

t
4

+

z



f ()(cid:20) 21 ()

t

+ 2 ()(cid:21) d,

which reads

l [f ] =

t
4




in terms of string variables.

+

z

f ()(cid:20) p ()

t

+ x ()(cid:21)(cid:20) p ()

t

+ x ()(cid:21) d

(4.88)

(4.89)

(4.90)

(4.91)

the important fact is that these functionals have a closed poisson bracket algebra. the

linear combination of functionals expressing the poisson bracket of two given functionals

l [f ] and l [g] is rather easy:

37

{l [f ] , l [g]} =

t
4

i.e. by denition (4.90):

+

z

[f () g ()  f  () g ()](cid:20) 21 ()

t

dening:

one has:

{l [f ] , l [g]} = l [f g  f g] .

f g  f g = f  g

{l [f ] , l [g]} = l [f  g] .

+ 2 ()(cid:21) d,

(4.92)

(4.93)

(4.94)

this tells us that equation (4.90) functionals span a closed symplectic algebra [16]. this

gives a canonical realization of the conformal group [17]. this canonical group is very

big, so big as the set of functions f and g which is possible to construct the ls with, so

its worth simplifying it ordering its elements in a more transparent way. we can do this

fourier-decomposing functions f as:

f () =xnz

an exp (in) ,

this induces the following basis for the algebra (4.94)

ln =

t
4

+

z

d exp (in)(cid:20)21 ()

t

+ 2 ()(cid:21) .

(4.95)

(4.96)

these ln are the very well known virasoro charges: its evident that the conservation of

these theoretical charges

ln = 0

follows without problems from secondary constraint stability. equation (4.97) yields as well

l [f ] = 0  f,

(4.98)

by the denition of (4.90).

in terms of z-number indices the algebra(4.94) becomes:

{lm, ln} = i (m  n) lm+n,

(4.99)

which is referred to as virasoro classical algebra [18]. by denition, virasoro charges are

thus the very constraints of conformal invariance:

lm  0.
