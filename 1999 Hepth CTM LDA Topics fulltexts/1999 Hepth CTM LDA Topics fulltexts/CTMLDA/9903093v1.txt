abstract

we study local mirror symmetry on non-compact calabi-yau man-
ifolds (conifold type of singularities) in the presence of d3 brane
probes. using an intermediate brane setup of ns 5-branes probed
by d4 resp. d5 branes, we can explicitly t-dualize three isometry
directions to relate a non-compact calabi-yau manifold to its local
mirror. the intermediate brane setup is the one that is best suited
to read o the gauge theory on the probe. both intervals and boxes
of ns 5-branes appear as brane setups. going from one to the other
is equivalent to performing a conifold transition in the dual geometry.
one result of our investigation is that the brane box rules as they
have been discussed so far should be generalized. our new rules do
not need diagonal elds localized at the intersection. the old rules
reappear on baryonic branches of the theory.

1 introduction

mirror symmetry is a symmetry which relates topologically distinct pairs
of (complex) d-dimensional calabi-yau manifolds to each other [1, 2].
in
the past, mirror symmetry was mainly discussed for compact calabi-yau
manifolds. if m and w constitute a calabi-yau mirror pair, it follows that

h1,1(m) = h1,d1(w),

h1,d1(m) = h1,1(w),

(1)

where hp,q denotes the dimension of the cohomology of p-holomorphic and q-
anti-holomorphic forms. this observation leads to very powerful predictions,
namely it identies the classical moduli space of complex structures of m
(w) with the quantum moduli space of the complexied kahler classes of w
(m), which includes quantum corrections from holomorphic curves.

the calabi-yau mirror symmetry was originally discovered in the context
of perturbative string compactications on calabi-yau three-folds, where the
mirror operation just corresponds to a sign ip of the charges of the u(1)
currents in the underlying superconformal n = 2 algebra [3, 4]. it implies
that the perturbative heterotic string is invariant under the mirror symme-
try, whereas the perturbative type iia and iib superstrings on calabi-yau
three-folds are mapped onto each other by the mirror operation. more re-
cently, assuming that mirror symmetry extends to a symmetry of the full
non-perturbative string theory, authors of [5] provided a geometric inter-
pretation to the mirror map. they showed that m has a quantum mirror
provided it is a t d bration over a d-dimensional base b, where the bers t d
are lagrangian submanifolds relative to the kahler form. mirror symmetry
is than the t -duality transformation with respect to the volume of t d, i.e.
it inverts all radii of t d.

in this paper we discuss t-duality and mirror symmetry for type ii string
theory on a particular class of calabi-yau spaces. in our point of view, the
geometry will serve as a background, and we will study the gauge theories
living on d-branes probing the manifolds.

consider rst a d3 brane probing a calabi-yau manifold m. at a smooth
point in m the tangent space is r6 and the d3 brane will have n = 4
supersymmetry on the world volume. to get something more interesting, we
have to consider calabi-yau manifolds with singularities. since we are only
interested in the local physics near the singularity, our manifolds will all be
non-compact calabi-yau spaces which, if one desires to, can be viewed as
having a completion to compact calabi-yau manifold.

3

some of the calabi yau manifolds we will study have hyperquotient sin-
gularities that can be obtained as orbifolds of the well known conifold singu-
larity c, and so are of the form c/, where  is a discrete symmetry group
a conifold admits. recently the gauge theory of d3 brane probing a conifold
singularity was derived in [6]. the theory of d3 brane on c/ is then dened
as a quotient of the theory on c by .1

we actually need to be a little bit more precise about the meaning of sin-
gularities in string theory. the calabi-yau singularities often have topologi-
cally distinct resolutions, the conifold singularity being the simplest example.
in that case, we could either deform the complex structure of the conifold
or its kahler structure to obtain a smooth manifold. now, when we discuss
the conifold in string theory we have to specify the means of smoothing the
singularity. this is because on the kahler side of the conifold it suces to
turn on the b eld ux to obtain theory isomorphic to that on the smooth
space.. the d3 brane theory constructed in [6] is the theory on the resolution
of the conifold. taking a quotient of this theory by  the resulting theories
should be viewed as coming from the kahler side of the singularity.

locally, complex and kahler structure moduli spaces decouple. thus,
if we are interested in a neighborhood in which m develops a singularity
through degeneration of its kahler structure, we can take the complex struc-
ture to be nice and smooth, and therefore trivial. canonically mirror sym-
metry acts by exchange of complex and kahler structure. if (m, w) form a
mirror pair, it is the complex structure of w that will be interesting.

the mirror geometries of the singularities will be constructed precisely
in the spirit of [5], namely by performing t-duality transformations around
three isometric directions of the geometric singularity. the singularities we
are interested in have a toric description so we can equivalently [10] apply
the local mirror map in the toric language [11]. the rst point of view will
be more useful for us, since it will allow us to follow the action of mirror

1the discussion of d3 branes on 6-dimensional singularities is very closely related to
the by now famous ads/cft correspondence. superconformal n = 2 or n = 1 (and also
n = 0) gauge theories can be constructed as the duals of supergravity on ads5x 5, where
x 5 is a certain ve-dimensional (einstein) manifold. first, for the case of d3 branes on
six-dimensional orbifold singularities o = r6/, where  is a discrete group, x 5 is given
by s 5/, as discussed in [7, 8]. the corresponding orbifold gauge theory can be calculated
using string perturbation theory. the conifold singularities were later obtained in [6],
where for the simplest conifold the corresponding einstein space x 5 is the homogeneous
space t 1
1 = (su (2)  su (2))/u (1). further conifold type of singularities were recently
discussed in [9].

symmetry on d-branes. since the mirror symmetry acts in the space trans-
verse to the d3 branes, the iib gauge theory of d3 branes probing the space
m will be mirror to an identical gauge theory but now due to iia d6 branes
wrapping a 3-cycles in w. mirror of the d3 brane at a smooth point will
be a d6 brane wrapping t 3. what will be the mirror of a d3 brane at the
singular point? the mirror d6 brane will wrap a three cycle which is still a
special lagrangian, but is now a degenerate three cycle which is homologous
to the ber at a generic point.

as it is known already for some time [12, 13], the geometric orbifold or
conifold singularities are t-dual to a certain number of neveu-schwarz (ns)
5-branes. this t-duality can be used [14, 15, 16, 9, 17, 18] to transform the
d3 branes probing a singularity into a pure brane conguration of intersecting
ns branes and d branes of the hanany-witten type [19, 20]. it is this fact
that we will systematically explore here.

in our case manifold m has three isometries on which t-duality tmirror
can be performed to obtain w. we can write the mirror transform tmirror
as a composition of two dualities tu and tv , such that starting with a sin-
gularity m and acting with tmirror on that space, we will rst dualize to a
certain brane conguration and subsequently further to the mirror geometry
w. from the brane point of view (taking ns5 branes to have x0,1,2,3 as com-
mon directions and extend along x4,5 and x8,9) so we will call tu = t6 and
tv = t48. from these two dierently oriented ns branes we can build boxes
or intervals, respectively, each giving rise to a pair of (tu , tv ) dual mirror
geometries. as is well known, one can suspend d4 branes on the intervals,
and d5 branes on the boxes to obtain four dimensional gauge theories on
the d brane world volumes. t-duality will map these to either probe d3
branes or the d6 branes wrapping three-cycles of the mirror geometry. the
resulting eld theory should be the same in all the t-dual realizations.

using these relations we can derive the rules that govern which gauge

theory is encoded in a given brane setup.

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section we will introduce
the relevant geometries, namely the conifold singularities and the orbifold
singularities and their generalizations. in the third section we will discuss
the gauge theories that appear on the d3 brane probes. in section four we
will introduce the t-dual brane setups  t-duality by tu or tv respectively
 and will discuss the t-duality without the probe. putting together the two
t-duality transformations we will see the mirror geometries emerging.
in
section ve we than incorporate the d3 brane probes. we will nd that the

5

brane box is the natural dual of the blowup of the orbifolded conifold and
of the deformed generalized conifold. in order to incorporate this result we
have to modify the brane box rules of hanany and zaaroni [20]. their gauge
theories reappear in a special corner of moduli space. our new construction
makes some aspects of the box rules more transparent. in section six we will
wrap up by considering some related issues. we will show that by the same
transformation t468 mirror symmetry can be dened for brane setups as well,
turning 2-cycles into 3-cycles. we will show how to put both, the box and
the interval together in one picture. this way we obtain a domain wall in an
n = 1 4d gauge theory that lifts to m-theory via a g2 3-cycle as in [21].

2 the geometries

2.1 conifold

the simplest isolated singularity a three dimensional calabi yau manifold
can develop is the conifold:

c :

xy  uv = 0

(2)

the singularity is located at x = y = u = v = 0 where the manifold fails
to be transverse: f = xy  uv = 0, if = 0 have a common solution there.
there are two ways of smoothing the singularity, resulting in topologically
distinct spaces.

 the so called small resolution  replacing the singular point by a
cp1, thereby changing the kahler structure. the resulting space has
h1,1 = 1, h2,1 = 0.

 by deformation of the dening equation, thereby changing the complex

structure. after the deformation, h1,1 = 0, h2,1 = 1.

small resolution

there are many ways in which one can exhibit the small resolution of the
conifold. the one particularly well suited for our purposes is as follows. one
can solve equation (2) by simply putting

x = a1b1,

y = a2b2,

u = a1b2,

v = a2b1,

(3)

6

r=0

r>0

r<0

fig.1. two small resolutions of the conifold are related by a op.

where ai, bj  c4. there clearly is a redundancy in this identication, since
for any   c, taking ai  ai, bj  1bj maps to the same point of the
conifold. we can remedy this as follows. we will think about c as r+  s 1,
that is we will put  = rei, with r > 0. take a quotient by r+ rst, by
picking r to set

|a1|2 + |a2|2  |b1|2  |b2|2 = 0.

(4)

to obtain a space isomorphic to the conifold we started with we must still
divide by the s 1 = u(1).
one can obtain a more physical interpretation of what we have done, which
stems from observation that the description of the conifold we have come up
with above is precisely that of a higgs branch of a particular linear sigma
model. it corresponds to a theory with four real supercharges, gauge group
u(1) with four matter elds ai, bj with charges +1 and 1, respectively and
no superpotential. the d-atness conditions are then given by equation (4).
this is of course not a new construction [22, 6].
turning on the fi parameter r will modify the d-atness conditions to

|a1|2 + |a2|2  |b1|2  |b2|2 = r.

(5)

we have three cases to consider here.

a.) for r = 0 we have a singular manifold the conifold.

b.) for r > 0, the origin ai = 0 = bj of the conifold is replaced by a
sphere of size |a1|2 + |a2|2 = r. from the point of view of geometry,
turning on the fi parameter [22] is naturally interpreted as blowing up
a sphere of size r.

7

c.) for r < 0, from the point of view of b) the kahler class is negative.
we do still have a smooth manifold, because now the origin is replaced
by |b1|2 + |b2|2 = r.

the manifolds in b.) and c.) are topologically distinct  they are related by
a op transition (see fig.1).

deformation

in addition to the smoothings we discussed above, conifold singularity can
be smoothed out by keeping the kahler structure xed but modifying the
dening equation. for this it suces to change the complex structure to:

xy  uv = .

as long as  6= 0, the conifold singularity has been removed. by examining
the equation in detail, one can show that the origin was replaced by an s 3.

2.2 more general singularities

we are now more or less in place to introduce toric geometry, as a tool for
treating more complicated singularities.

we will use the language of linear sigma models to put the discussion
on a more physical basis [22, 23]. we are constructing a linear sigma model
whose moduli space will be a calabi-yau manifold m. first, the number of
independent fi parameters, or equivalently the number of u(1) factors, will
equal h1,1(m) (unless stated otherwise, by m we mean the manifold obtained
by smoothing out the singularity).
it is this number, and the charges of
various matter multiplets that toric geometry must encode.

a toric diagram consists of d + n vectors {~vi} in a lattice n = zd. every
vector ~vi corresponds to a matter multiplet in our sigma model which we will
call xi. to describe a toric variety homeomorphic to other than at space
we need n > 0. since n is d-dimensional, there are n relations between the
d + n vectors which we will write in the form

d+n

x

i=1

qa

i ~vi = 0,

a = 1, . . ., n.

(6)

8

it is clear that qs should be interpreted as the charges of the matter elds
under the n u(1)s. as a consequence the d-atness conditions will read,

d+n

x

i=1

qa

i |xi|2 = ra,

a = 1, . . ., n.

(7)

m is a space of solutions to (7), up to the identications imposed by gauge
symmetry. or, instead of setting d-terms to zero and dividing by the gauge
group, we could have taken a quotient by the complexied gauge group
xi  qa
i xi , a = 1, . . ., n , where   c and express the moduli space as
the space of gauge invariant polynomials in xs, modulo any relations be-
tween them. this is the language of eq.(2).

there is one slight simplication that occurs when m is a (non-compact)
calabi-yau manifold. namely, m is a calabi-yau if and only if there exists
a vector ~h  m, where m is the dual lattice of n, such that

< ~h, ~vi > = 1,

 ~vi

i.e. if and only if all the vectors ~vi live on a hyperplane a unit distance away
from the origin of n. therefore in all of our examples toric singularities can
be described by planar diagrams, only.

hyperquotient singularities

as is well known, one can obtain more complicated geometries by taking a
quotient of the simpler ones by a properly chosen group action. dividing
cn by a discrete symmetry group  we obtain orbifolds with quotient sin-
gularities. taking a quotient of a hypersurface singularity like c we obtain
what are called hyperquotient singularities. both can be treated easily in the
language of toric geometry. first however, we must nd appropriate symme-
try group of our manifold. clearly, any action xi  ixi, || = 1 leaves the
manifold invariant. the symmetry group is u(1)n+d/u(1)n = exp(2izd).
more precisely, the toric variety m will contain the torus t d as a dense open
subset. there is a natural action of u(1)d = t d on the toric variety given as
follows. to any element ~n  zd, we can associate an element of u(1)d via
xi  einixi, where ~n = p ni~vi dened up to p qa

so far, our lattice was integral. now suppose we rene the lattice by
adding a vector in qd for example ~q = 1
r (a1, . . . , ad). for as long as the
lattice was integral the torus action was well dened. now, it will be so only

i ~vi = 0.

9

if we induce additional identications on the xis, namely writing ~q = p qi
(mod p qi~vi), we should identify

r ~vi,

xi  e

2iqi

r xi.

perhaps a better way to express the action of the quotient, is in terms of
gauge invariant monomials. clearly, any c invariant monomial is of the
form

xm = y x<~vi, ~m>

i

,

so the space of c invariant monomials is just the dual lattice m. actually
we want a bit less, since a) only the positive powers should appear, so we
only want those ~ms that satisfy < ~m, ~vi > 0, i, and b) we only want the
independent ones. then, the identication induced on the monomials is

xm  e2i<~q, ~m>xm.

in any event, we should now be ready to produce new spaces. we are up to
producing orbifolds of the conifold, c/. let us take  = zk  zl. so, start
with our conifold c, dened by four vectors ~v1,2,3,4  n as before, but rene
the lattice to n by adding two vectors, ~ek = ( 1
l , 0). the
resulting toric diagram (cf. fig.2) looks the same as that for the conifold
c, except for the fact that it lives in a ner lattice. this, as explained above,
results in the following identications:

k , 0, 0), and ~el = (0, 1

~ek =

1
k

(~v2  ~v1),

we nd that the quotient acts by

a1  e

2i

k a1, b1  e

2i

k b1, a2  a2, b2  b2,

and similarly for ~el,

the quotient is by

~el =

1
l

(~v3  ~v1),

a1  e

2i

l a1, b1  b1, a2  a2, b2  e

2i

l b2.

equivalently on xy = uv, we identify x  x, y  y, u  e
and x  e

k v,
l y, u  u, v  v. in terms of  invariant coordinates

k u, v  e

l x, y  e

x = xl, y  = yl, z = xy, u = uk, v  = vk, w = uv, the dening equation of
the conifold becomes simply z = w. taking into account that not all the
invariant monomials are independent, the  = zk  zl orbifolded conifold,
after obvious renaming of variables becomes:

ck,l :

xy = zl,

uv = zk.

(k,0,1)

fig.2. (blowup of) orbifolded conifold ck,l.

blowing up

toric geometry has equipped us with a means of blowing up the singularity.
first lets look at the orbifold ckl. there are still only four vectors dening
the diagram which were inherited from the conifold. there is a single relation
between them, and thus a single kahler class but this is insucient to smooth
out ck,l. however, due to the fact that the lattice is ner, there exist lattice
points within the rectangle, these are. all the points ~vi,j = (i, j, 1), 0  i  k,
0  j  l. we can add these points to the toric diagram. in the language
of linear sigma models, the eect is to add more matter elds, but also more
u(1) factors, and thus more fi parameters. clearly, the resolved manifold
will have h1,1(ck,l) = (k + 1)(l + 1)  3, which is the total number of linearly
dependent vectors within the diagram.
(points outside the diagram can
be added as well. however they will not contribute to the resolution of
the singularity, but only modify it by irrelevant pieces.) we will not try
to specify precise region in the kahler structure moduli space where the
resolution lives, which would correspond to picking a triangulation of the
toric diagram, because we will not need this piece of information. it is clear
there will be very many dierent such regions, and they are all related by
ops.

11

finally, starting from the orbifolded conifold ck,l, with k, l suciently
large, by performing partial resolutions we can obtain essentially any other
toric singularity. the basic fact to note that adding or subtracting one of
the boundary points of the diagram changes h1,1  h1,1  1. the right
interpretation of this is that we are probing the region of the kahler structure
moduli space where the four cycle associated to this point in the toric diagram
becomes large enough, that it in fact becomes irrelevant to the local physics
 the associated vectors can be dropped altogether.

we will provide some more examples of the spaces we will explicitly use

in this paper and introduce some terminology.

starting from an orbifold of c by zk,

ck :

xy = zk,

uv = z,

(9)

or equivalently xy = (uv)k, which has h1,1(ck) = 2k  1, by partial resolution
we can obtain the generalization of a conifold,

gkl :

xy = ukvl

(10)

with only k + l  1 kahler structure deformations. clearly, in our notation
ck  gkk.

the conventional orbifold okl = c3/zk  zl can be found in the kahler
structure moduli space of the orbifolded conifold ckl, the toric diagram of
the orbifold being contained in that of the orbifolded conifold. one way
to see this is indeed a toric diagram corresponding to c3/zk  zl is to use
the fact that the diagram can be obtained starting from a toric diagram
containing just three vectors ~v1 = (0, 0, 1), ~v2 = (1, 0, 1), ~v3 = (0, 1, 1) in an
integral lattice n, which gives a toric variety homeomorphic to at space,

12

and then rene the lattice to n, as in fig.4. the map from the toric variety
in n to the one living in n is one to one provided one includes discrete
identications on the three matter elds ai, i = 1, 2, 3,

k a3.

as before, number of kahler structure deformations is just the number
of independent points in the toric diagram, and this number will clearly
depend on whether (k, l) are coprime or not, since the number of points on
the diagonal is gcd(k, l) + 1.

deformations

 the orbifolded conifold ckl :

xy = zk,

uv = zl can be deformed to

a smooth space by modifying the dening equation as:

k

xy =

y

(z  wi)

uv =

y

(z  w

j).

(11)

i=1

j=1

one of these parameters can be set to 1 by shifting z, so we are left
with k + l  1 parameters. this gives h2,1(ckl) = k + l  1.

 the generalized conifold gkl :

xy = ukvl can be deformed into

xy =

k,l

x

i,j=0

mijuivj.

(12)

this time we see h2,1(gkl) = (k + 1)(l + 1)  3 complex structure defor-
mations mij: by shifting u, v, we can eliminate two of the parameters,
and another one by rescaling the dening equation.

mirror symmetry

toric geometry is well adopted to discussing mirror symmetry as well. we
will review it here very briey, only. mirror symmetry exchanges the kahler

13

structure parameters with the complex structure parameters. now, to un-
derstand the mirror map, we rst need to know something about the com-
plex structure moduli space. how is the complex structure encoded in the
equation of the manifold? the answer is as follows: the coecients of the
monomials appearing in the dening equation are coordinates on the complex
structure moduli space. what they parameterize are the sizes of various
three-cycles (i.e. the periods of the holomorphic three form) and the metric
on the moduli space. the periods, (and therefore the metric  the moduli
space has special geometry structure) can be derived directly as a solution
to a system of dierential equations. the main point is that the dierential
equations depend solely on the relationships between the monomials in the
dening equation and nothing else.

given the toric manifold, relations between the vectors in the toric dia-
gram of m (we are assuming a completely smooth space here, with all the
possible blowups performed),

n+d

x

i=1

qi

a~vi,

a = 1, . . . n

map to relationships between the monomials in the dening equation of w,
the mirror of m, given by

w : x

aimi = 0,

i

(13)

where ai are coecients, and mi monomials, the monomials must satisfy

n+d

y

i=1

mqa

i

i = 1,

a = 1, . . . n.

(14)

any solution to these equations (and in general there are more than one)
will represent the same complex structure (by decoupling of complex and
kahler moduli spaces). note that there are n + d monomials with n relations
between them. together with the hypersurface equation, this gives a d  1
dimensional manifold, but the homogeneity of the monomial relations will
allow us to remove one more. the mirror will naively have d  2 dimen-
sions. this is not a problem, rather an artifact of the fact that local mirror
symmetry is encoding all the information about the complex structure of the
mirror, and nothing but. one can x the dimensionality of the local mirror

14

by adding quadratic pieces, as this will not inuence the complex structure
moduli space.

let us briey show how this works for the two examples we are going to
be concerned with in this work, gkl and ckl. consider rst the blowup of
ckl. we want to interpret the same diagram fig.2 as dening the complex
structure of the mirror. assigning the vector (i, j, 1) to a monomial uivj
clearly eq.(14) is satised for all the relations. the dening equation for the
mirror of ckl hence becomes according to eq.(13):

k,l

x

i,j=0

mijuivj = 0

or after adding the irrelevant quadratic piece xy

xy = x mijuivj

which is nothing but the deformation of gkl.

having established that the deformation of gkl is mirror to the blowup
of ckl we can nd another dual pair by following our geometries through a
conifold transition. we should nd that the blowup of gkl is the mirror of
the deformation of ckl. let us see how this works. as above we read of the
mirror to be

k

l

(z  wi) + t

y

i=0

(z  w

j) = 0.

y

j=0

because t appears only linearly this encodes the same complex structure as

k

l

y

(z  wi) = uv,

y

(z  w

j) = xy

i=0

j=0

which is indeed the deformation of ckl as presented in eq.(11).

3 the gauge theories

having introduced the geometric background spaces, we will now discuss the
corresponding gauge theories if one adds m d3 branes with world volume
transverse to the non-compact manifolds. the corresponding gauge group

15

for the orbifolded conifold ckl, eq.(8), is given by the following n = 1 super-
symmetric gauge theory:

su(m)kl  su(m)kl

(15)

with matter elds (a1)i+1,j+1;i,j, (a2)i,j;i,j, (b1)i,j;i,j +1, (b2)i,j;i+1,j +1. we
label the gauge groups with i, i = 1 . . . k and j, j = 1 . . . l. all the matter
elds are bifundamental under the gauge groups indicated by the indices.
the just zk orbifolded conifold arises as the special case l = 1. in addition
there will be a quartic superpotential

w = x

i,j

 x

i,j

(a1)i+1,j+1;i,j(b1)i,j;i,j +1(a2)i,j+1;i,j +1(b2)i,j+1;i+1,j +1

(a1)i+1,j+1;i,j(b1)i,j;i+1,j(a2)i+1,j;i+1,j(b2)i+1,j;i+1,j +1. (16)

the other singularity, the generalized conifold eq.(10) corresponds to

su(m)k+l

with bifundamental matter according to urangas rules [9] and quartic su-
perpotentials.

finally consider m d3 branes on a transversal orbifold singularity okl.

they give rise to an

su(m)kl

(17)

gauge theory with 3 types of chiral bifundamental multiplets hi,j;i+1,j,
vi,j;i,j+1 and di+1,j+1;i,j in each gauge group and a cubic superpotential

w = x

i,j

hi,j;i+1,jvi+1,j;i+1,j+1di+1,j+1,i.j 

(18)

vi,j;i,j+1hi,j+1;i+1,j+1di+1,j+1;i,j.

x

i,j

this way the orbifold gauge theories will have 3m matter elds per gauge
group and cubic superpotentials, leaving us with a nite theory. the conifold
gauge theories have 2m matter elds per gauge group and quartic superpo-
tentials. these theories are non-nite but ow to a xed line parameterized
by a marginal operator in the ir.

16

4 the t-dual brane setups and mirror sym-

metry

in this section we would like to discuss the brane congurations which are
t-dual to the singularities introduced in section 2. specically, we are inter-
ested in two dierent t-duality transformations: the rst one was recently
discussed by uranga [9] and by dasgupta and mukhi [17]. the dual brane
picture consists of ns and rotated ns 5-branes we will henceforth refer to it
as tu . the d3 branes which we want to study in the next section become d4
branes after the t6 duality transformation which live on the compact interval
in x6.

second we perform a t-duality along the compact directions x4 and x8,
t48 = t4t8. this maps the singularities again to ns and ns branes, where
now the d3 probes become d5 branes which ll the compact brane box in
the x4  x8 spatial directions. this t-duality was rst introduced in [13]
and for a special point in moduli space used by [15] to study d3 branes on
orbifold singularities. we will henceforth refer to it as tv .

these t-dualities are very useful in the sense that they allow us to read
of the gauge groups on the d3 brane world volume according to some very
intuitive graphic rules encoded in the brane conguration. while for the
orbifold a perturbative string calculation is also available to get the gauge
group, for the more general singularities discussed here, one would have to
rely on a technique as in [6].

combining the two, that is doing t468 we actually performed a local
mirror symmetry transformation. we will see explicitly, that tmirror takes a
geometry w into its mirror geometry m. the gauge theory of a d3 brane
probing w has to be identical to that on a d6 brane wrapping a 3-cycle in
m.

this should correspond to the mirror transformations for calabi-yau
spaces, which are the compact counterparts of our non-compact singular-
ities. these compact cys are assumed t 3-brations (with t 3 a special
lagrangian submanifold of the cy) and the mirror transformations acts as
the inversion of the volume of the t 3. obviously, this t 3 corresponds to our
three directions x4, x6 and x8, on which the mirror symmetry acts.

17

4.1 the brane setup

before we embark on the discussion let us briey recall the basic brane setup.
there are two congurations we are going to consider, for one the standard
hw [19, 24] type of brane setup, where d4 branes are stretched in between
ns and ns branes, former living along 012345 and latter along 012389, the
rotation being necessary in order to break susy down from 8 to 4 super-
charges. in order to have a supersymmetric theory from d4 branes on the
interval all the ns and ns branes have to be at the same position in the 7
direction. separations along the 7 direction would be interpreted as fi terms
or baryonic branches in the gauge theory and eectively leads to a breaking
of the gauge group we want to see. similarly we should require all the ns
branes to have the same position in 89 and all the ns branes to have the
same position in 45 space. they are separated along the 6 direction building
the intervals, along which the d4 branes (living in 01236) stretch.

the second kind of brane setup we are going to consider are the so called
brane boxes [20], which are a straight forward generalization of the interval
theories. the brane box is a rectangle bounded by ns and ns branes with
a d5 brane suspended on it. this can be achieved by the same ns and ns
branes as above but now all branes have to be located at the same 67 position,
closing the intervals. we can open up the boxes by separating the ns and
ns branes along their 48 directions (unfortunately this way we dier from
the notation in [20], where the boxes were taken to live in the 46 space. this
is necessary, since it is crucial for us, that box and interval can be realized
by the same set of ns and ns branes). we still want to keep the 5 and 9
positions equal in order to preserve supersymmetry of the suspended probes.
deformations along these directions are again fi terms in the gauge theory,
which are reinterpreted as baryonic branches after freezing out the diagonal
u(1)s.

4.2 deformations and blowups

as mentioned above, it is important to distinguish whether we want to study
the deformation or the blowup of the singularity under investigation. the
corresponding parameters should have an interpretation in the brane picture
as well. if the dual is pure brane, i.e. consists only of branes in at space,
this interpretation will be solely in terms of ns brane positions and, as will
be established later, on brane shapes. otherwise some of the parameters

18

encode blowups of the non-trivial background geometry. even though latter
description of the probe may still be useful, e.g.
in order to read o gauge
group and matter content, we would like to focus in the rest of our discussion
on the case, where the dual is pure brane.

let us forget for a moment about the d brane probes altogether. that
is, we want to study the map of the singular geometry into a conguration
of ns branes, as pioneered in [13]. actually it turns out to be easier to start
with the ns brane congurations, where it is clear what we mean by the 4, 6
and 8 direction. performing t48 and t6 respectively we will nd two dierent
geometries, which have to be the local mirrors of each other. by construction
these are precisely the geometries that have a pure brane dual (we started out
with a pure brane setup!). we will nd the following relations, as indicated
in fig.8 in the summary at the end of this paper:

 the blowup of the generalized conifold is tu dual to ns branes sepa-
rated along 67 (the interval). these are in turn tv dual to the mirror,
the deformation of the orbifolded conifold.

 similarly the blowup of the orbifolded conifold will tv dualize into a box
and then tu dualize in the mirror, the deformation of the generalized
conifold.

indeed these two transformations are related by a conifold transition, that
is bringing together the ns branes on the interval and then separating them
along 4589 instead corresponds to blowing down the 2-cycles and opening
up the 3-cycles of the deformed conifold (and vice versa for the orbifolded
conifold).

4.3 the brane box, blowup of the orbifolded and de-

formation of the generalized conifold

j = (x4, x5) positions of the k ns and l ns branes
j = (x6, x7) the positions in the

let mi = (x8, x9), m
respectively in x4,5,8,9, and wi = (x6, x7), w
other two directions.
let us start with a brane box, that is we set all the wi and w
j to zero.
t-dualizing the brane box along x4,8 we obtain a manifold we call m and
t-dualizing along x6 we obtain w. the resulting geometries are related by
t468 = tmirror.

19

 tv = t48 : the t-dual space m is a zk  zl orbifolded conifold

ck,l :

xy = zl,

uv = zk

as in (8), where k, l are numbers of ns and ns branes. this is a double
c bration over the z plane, that is the space has 2 u(1) isometries
used in t duality. the x4, x8 separations of the branes must map
into b-uxes through 2-cycles of the t-dual space. we must therefore
identify mi, m
j as deformations of the kahler structure. deformations
of the kahler structure cannot change the complex structure, so the mi
and m
j will not be visible in the dening equations. having identied
mi, m
j are identied as
j as the kahler structure parameters, wi and w
complex structure parameters. but they are frozen, since turning them
on would destroy the box structure.

for deniteness take iib theory on ckl. tv duality takes us back to
type iib with ns branes.
in this case kahler structure parameters,
that is the 2-sphere sizes, sit in hypermultiplets. the other 3 scalars
in this multiplet are the ns-ns b-ux the rr b-ux and the rr 4-
form-ux through the sphere. latter is a 2-form in 4d, which can be
dualized into a scalar. the 2-sphere size and the ns-ns b-ux are the
complexied kahler parameter which map to mi and m
j under tv . in
the brane box the two other scalars come from wilson lines of the ns-
world volume gauge elds in 45 and 89 which pair up in hypermultiplets
with mi and m

j respectively.

note however that we have a puzzle. the orbifolded conifold ckl has,
as we have found from the toric description,

(k + 1)(l + 1)  3 = kl + k + l  2

kahler structure parameters mij which can be turned on to smooth out
ckl. only k + l  2 have been realized in terms of the (relative) brane
positions mi and m
j.

so where are the kl hypermultiplets in the brane box skeleton? they
sit at the kl intersections! strings stretching from ns to ns give rise
to precisely these hypermultiplets 2.

2they are stromingers d3 brane on the vanishing 3-sphere in the geometry (remember

that we only consider blowups, so the 3-spheres are xed at zero size).

20

turning on vevs for the two scalars corresponding to 2-sphere sizes
and ns-ns uxes resolves the intersection of the ns and ns into a
smooth object, a little diamond. for non-zero b-elds this diamond
will open up in the 48 plane, for 2-sphere sizes in the 59 plane. this
interpretation will become more suggestive after discussing tu on this
conguration and once we start discussing the d3 brane probes.

in the geometry the 2-spheres give rise to strings from wrapping d3
branes around them. how do we see them in the ns5 box skeleton?
the d3 branes on the k + l  2 spheres from the curves of singularities
correspond to (fractional) d3 branes living in the boxes (or better in
whole stripes). the additional kl strings must now correspond to d3
branes in the diamonds. we will indeed see that the diamonds allow
for such a conguration.

of course the same story can be repeated in type iia. here the dia-
monds will correspond to matter on the intersection of type iia ns5
branes, this time sitting in a vector multiplet. again the 2 scalars cor-
respond to the kl sizes and b-uxes of the corresponding 2-spheres.
instead of the two additional scalars in the hypermultiplet we this time
see a vector from the rr 3-form on the sphere. in the brane language
the wilson lines of the ns5 gauge eld have to be substituted by wilson
lines of the (2,0) 2-form eld, again giving rise to vectors.

 tu = t6, t-duality to w. what happens now is as follows. since we
did a t6 duality, x6 separations will become the b-elds. thus, now
the wi (which had to be put to zero since we are discussing a box)
parameters are kahler structure deformations, while the non-zero mij
now should show up as complex structure deformations.

the dual geometry should be a single c bration. this will be de-
scribed by an equation whose parameters, the complex structure defor-
mations, must be mij. let us rst study the situation where the vevs
of the hypers living at the intersections are zero. in this case the c
bration must degenerate over the ns and ns positions mi, m
j, but in
an independent way, since the branes are orthogonal  it must contain
two curves of singularities am1, and an1 corresponding to ns and

21

ns branes. there is one such equation for generic values of mis

w : uv =

k

y

i=1

l

(z  mi)

y

(w  m
j)

j=1

the curve contains kl conifold singularities located at z = mi and
w = m
j corresponding to the fact that all the hypermultiplets at the
intersections where turned o.

let us jump ahead and let us realize w directly as the mirror of m.
performing the local mirror map we obtain:

w : uv =

k

l

x

x

i=0

j=0

mijziwj.

by now the t-dual interpretation of this more general space should be
clear. it describes a single ns brane wrapping a curve

 :

0 =

k

l

x

x

i=0

j=0

mijziwj.

the smoothing out of the intersections corresponds to the diamonds.
for example one intersecting ns and ns brane is described by zw = 0.
turning on the hypermultiplet corresponds to smoothing this out to
zw = m00, as e.g discussed in [25] for the related case of intersecting
d7 branes.
indeed the resulting smooth curve has a non vanishing
circle of radius (m00)1/2 as can be seen by writing it as x2 + y2 = m00
and restrict oneself to the real section thereof, for example3. this is
precisely what we need: we can suspend a d3 brane as a soap bubble on
the ns skeleton, its boundary being given by the circle. the tension
of the resulting string is given by the area of the disk and hence is
proportional to m00 as expected from the dual geometry m (where the
size of the 2-sphere was also proportional to m). in w the same string
will be given by a d4 brane on the vanishing 3-sphere.

in the same way we can t-dualize any singularity that can be repre-
sented as a toric variety into a generalized box of ns branes, with a
certain amount of diamonds frozen.

3we are very grateful to m. bershadsky for very helpful discussions on this point

22

4.4 going to the interval: the conifold transition

we can derive a second t-dual triple of geometry t-dual brane setup and
mirror geometry by studying tu and tv on the interval theory. note that
the interval theory can be directly obtained from the box by brane motions.
first we move all the ns and ns branes on top of each other, setting all mij
to zero, closing all the boxes and diamonds. this is the conifold point. now
we see that we have the choice to open up the intervals, by turning on the
wi and w
j.

we can follow this transition in the geometry as well. let us see what it
does to m. for one we have shrunk all the 2-spheres to zero size, putting
us at the most singular point of the geometry. in addition we have put all
the b-elds to zero. so we are really sitting at the real codimension 2 locus
of kahler moduli space, where the closed string cft description goes bad
[22]. this is once more the conifold point. from there we can deform the
singularity by turning on 3-spheres to obtain mt and this is precisely what
corresponds to turning on the wi and w
j in the brane picture. this is a (non-
abelian) conifold transition [26]. we went from the blowup of the orbifolded
conifold ckl to its deformation. let us see that tv still works. the wi, w
i
must now be identied with complex structure deformations. the geometry
has to have a c  c bration which degenerates over those points. this
leads us to

k

(z  wi)

xy =

y

i=1

l

uv =

y

(z  w
i)

j=1

as the t-dual geometry, indeed.

last but not least we can study the eect on w. in going to wt , the
mirror of mt , we this time send all the 3-spheres to zero size and then turn
on blowup modes, taking us from the deformed generalized conifold gkl to
its blowup.

23

5 probing the mirror geometries

5.1

introducing the probe: elliptical models

as a next step we want to introduce m d3 brane probes on top of our
geometry. this way we break the supersymmetry down to 4 supercharges
and get interesting n = 1 4d gauge theory. the deformation parameters of
the singularity appear as parameters in the gauge theory, the moduli space
of the gauge theory describes the motion of m d3 branes on the singular
space. these probe theories have received a lot of attention recently. they
give rise to conformal eld theories and have a dual ads description.

in principle we could take any of the four geometries we introduced,
compactify type iib on it and then put a d3 brane probe on top of the
singularity. the two situations we are going to study are m d3 branes on
the blowup of the generalized conifold gkl (on wt ) and m d3 branes on the
blowup of the orbifolded conifold ckl (on m).

performing our two t-dualities tu and tv we will nd two dierent real-
izations of each of the probe theories. the background geometry will trans-
form precisely as we discussed in the last section. this way

 m d3 brane probes of the blowup of the generalized conifold wt are
j and tmirror

tu dual to d4 branes on an interval dened by wi and w
to d6 branes wrapping 3-cycles in mt

 m d3 brane probes of the blowup of the orbifolded conifold m are tv
dual to d5 branes on a box dened by mij and tmirror to d6 branes
wrapping 3-cycles in w.

we will have to deal with what is usually referred to as elliptical models
in the literature [27, 15]. that is the 6 direction of the interval or the 48
direction of the box are actually compact, leaving no room for semi-innite
branes. all d-brane groups will actually be gauged.

5.2 the generalized conifold and the interval

first we would like to consider the gauge theory on the world volume of m
d3 brane probes on the blowup of a generalized conifold singularity. this
gauge theory is given e.g. in [9] and can be read o most easily in the dual
brane setup we are about to describe. in the last section we showed that

24

this geometry is tu dual to ns and ns branes on a circle, forming intervals
with 67 separations given by wi and w
j, all the mij being zero. as utilized in
[9, 17] this means that the m d3 brane probes turn into an elliptical model
with m d4 branes wrapping the circle.
it is straight forward to read o
the gauge theory from this according to the standard hw rules. of course
it agrees perfectly with the one obtained from applying a standard orbifold
procedure directly on the conifold gauge theory of [6].

there is yet another realization of the same gauge theory. performing the
whole tmirror = t468 we can turn wt , the blowup of the generalized conifold
on which we originally put the d3 brane probes, into mt , the deformation
of the orbifolded conifold. the theory with which we have to compare is that
on the mirror of the d3 probe, that is a d6 brane wrapping susy 3-cycles
in mt . but this is precisely the situation discussed in [28]. the parameters
wi and w
i in mt , given by (11) determine the loci in the z plane where the
c  c bration degenerates. as found in [28] in order to have a bps state
i have to align along a line in the z plane. since the s 1  s 1
the wi and w
bration degenerates over wi and w
i, we can regard this bration over the
interval between neighboring wi and w
i as a 3-cycle. in [28] it was shown that
this 3-cycle is s 3 and s 2 s 1 respectively, depending on whether neighboring
points are a w, w pair or both w (both w). in the former case one obtains
a quartic superpotential, in the latter case an n = 2 like setup. obviously
this yields the same gauge theory as the d3 probe on wt and the d4 brane
on the interval.

5.3 d5 branes on the box: the modied box rules

the second theory we would like to consider are m d3 branes on an zk  zl
orbifolded conifold. as shown above, the geometry dualizes under tv into
brane boxes where the ns5 brane skeleton wraps the curve pk,l
i,j=0 mijziwj.
k + l  2 of the mij parameters can be associated to brane positions, while
the other kl parameters correspond to diamonds, that is the hypermultiplets
sitting at the ns ns intersections, whose vev smoothes out the singular
intersections.

the probe d3 branes turn into d5 branes living on these boxes and
diamonds. again this should in principle be a very useful duality in the sense
that we can read o the associated gauge theories by using some analogue
of the hw rules.
in addition some information about the corresponding
quantum gauge theory should be obtainable by lifting the setup to m-theory.

in order to understand our rules it is best to start with the easiest example,
the conifold c, eq.(2), itself. the dual description just is that of a single
ns and ns brane on a square torus, as depicted in the upper left corner
of fig.5. the conifold has one blowup parameter, corresponding to the one

diamond sitting at the intersection. as long as we keep the size of the 2-
sphere zero, the b-ux through the sphere will correspond to the size of the
diamond. as we have argued in the last section, the curve describing the
diamond actually supports a non-trivial s 1 on which the d5 brane can end,
so the gauge theory will have two group factors, su(m)  su(m). the
inverse gauge couplings are proportional to the area of the corresponding
faces. there is a special point, when the diamond has the same area as the
other gauge group, that is the diamond occupies half of the torus. in this
case we know that we have to recover the standard conifold gauge theory of
[6]. this can easily be implemented using the simple brane rules specied
in the upper right corner. we have to demand, that half of the matter
multiplets we would naively expect are projected out. the orientation of the
arrows seems quite arbitrary. indeed we will see that the orientation can be
changed and that this corresponds to performing op transitions in the dual

geometry. indeed one can easily establish that these rules also are capable
of realizing more complicated setups. generically, the gauge theory on the
zk  zl orbifolded conifold has a su(m)kl  su(m)kl gauge group. in our
picture the gauge group factors will correspond to the kl diamonds and the
kl boxes respectively. again it is easiest to compare at the point, where all
gauge couplings are equal. in this case, both the diamonds as well as the
boxes degenerate to rhombes, as pictured in fig.6, where we denoted them
as lled and unlled boxes. generalizing our a and b elds from above we
will nd that the matter elds transform as (where the two sets of kl gauge
groups are indexed by small and capital letters respectively)

which are exactly the rules expected [9]. this proposal can also easily
deal with the situation of non-trivial identications on the torus as discussed
in [15].
in addition there will be quartic superpotential for every closed
rectangle, the relative sign being given by the orientation

we do not expect that this picture changes when we take the sizes of box
and diamond to dier. we will still see the a and b elds. only the relative
couplings will change and no new elds or interactions appear, since they
certainly dont in the dual geometry. the singular conifold points correspond
to the situations where diamonds close. from the eld theory point of view
this just means that we take the corresponding gauge coupling to innity. as
in the standard hw situation with only parallel ns branes this corresponds
to a strong coupling xed point with possibly enhanced global symmetry if
several ns branes coincide.

another interesting question to consider is to ask ourselves what happens
when we blow up the spheres to nite size. this now should correspond
to some mode of the diamond that rotates it away out of the 48 plane
into the 59 plane. according to common lore this should correspond to a fi
term in the gauge theory. we will no longer be able to support a d5 brane
stretched inside the diamonds in a supersymmetric fashion, independent of
their size (that is the b-eld)4. since we expect that the center of mass
u(1)s are frozen out as in [27], the fi term will be reinterpreted as usual
as a baryonic branch. especially there should exist a baryonic branch along
which we reduce to the orbifold gauge theory.

indeed as shown in [9] the gauge theories we described here do have such
a baryonic branch. giving a vev to (say) all the a2 elds will break each
su(m)ij  su(m)ij pair down to its diagonal su(m)ab subgroup. the
remaining massless elds after the higgs mechanism are

da+1,b+1;a,b = (a1)a+1,b+1;a,b ( a+1,b+1, a,b)
( a,b, a,b+1)

( a,b, a+1,b)
va,b;a+1,b

= (b1)a,b;a,b+1
= (b2)a,b;a+1,b

4this is very similar to what happens on the interval: blowing up a sphere corresponds
to moving o an ns brane in the 7 direction. since in order to preserve supersymmetry
branes are only allowed to stretch along the 6 direction this eectively reduces the number
of gauge groups (the number of intervals) by one. the 6 position of the brane we moved
away (the b-eld on the blown up sphere) does not aect the massless matter content
anymore.

which are precisely the box rules of [20], as claimed. note that the diagonal
d elds are not special at all, they arise just from the fundamental a, b
degrees of freedom of the generalized box.

a small complication arises once we consider situations that are more

involved than the conifold. for simplicity let us study the case of the z2
orbifolded conifold. since this can as well be thought of as the g22 generalized
conifold, it has an interval dual as well as a box dual. both of them are
displayed in fig.7 for various values of the b-elds. the gauge group is
su(m)4. we should see 3 b-elds governing the relative sizes of the gauge
couplings. according to our scenario this will correspond to one relative
brane position b and the sizes of two diamonds b1 and b2. in the interval

29

picture b1,2 will be the distance between ns1,2 and ns1,2 while b is the
distance between the center of masses of the two ns ns pairs, denoted as
circles in fig.7. take the circle to have circumference 2 and the torus to
have sides 2 and 1. since b-elds (=inverse gauge couplings) are length on
the interval and areas on the torus, in these units the area of a given gauge
group on the torus should have the same numerical value as the corresponding
length on the circle (total area=total length=2). the third picture in fig.7
shows b = 1 b1 = b2 = 1/2 both sides have 4 gauge groups of size 1/2.

it is easy to identify in both theories the point where all gauge couplings
are equal, the point where all b-elds are zero (the most singular point)
and the point where the setup looks like two separated conifolds. similarly
for all positive values of the bi and of b we can read o the gauge theory
from the diamonds, just using the standard a and b elds, representing the
diamonds as rhombes of area bi. however from the interval it is clear, that we
can also pass an ns brane through an ns brane, performing seiberg duality
on the gauge theory and simultaneously changing the sign of one of the bi
elds [9, 29]. if we set b1 = b2 = 1/2 the picture looks the same as for
b1 = b2 = 1/2. the overall sign does not matter. however the sixth picture
of fig.7 shows a setup where the signs of the bi dier. we should assign
our diamonds an orientation in order to be able to address this issue. this
orientation assigns whether the a or the b elds point outward or inward,
the other doing the opposite. the rules we have introduced are valid for the
case that all orientations are equal. the situation with opposite orientations
is slightly more complicated. the rules can be determined by comparing with
the interval. whenever the arrows point around the closed rectangle we write
down a quartic superpotential. if diamonds with dierent orientation touch,
we will have to introduce additional meson elds with cubic superpotential
(see the 6th picture in fig.7). since this inversion of orientation should
correspond to seiberg duality in the eld theory, we basically found this way
a realization of n = 1 dualities in the box and diamond picture! it would
be clearly interesting to pursue this point further, for example by studying
theories with orientifolds. this may give us a hint of a brane realization of
pouliot like dualities [30] and spinors, since it is easy to realize the magnetic
side of these theories in the box and diamond picture using orientifolds.

last but not least we should be able to see the same gauge groups in the
third t-dual realization as well, that is from d6 branes wrapping the 3-cycles

in the same spirit as above following [28]. it would be interesting to work this
out and see if some properties of the gauge theory can be better understood
in this language.

6 mirror branes and domain walls

6.1 the mirror branes

the d3 brane probe we have been considering so far maps to a d4 brane
on the interval and a d5 brane in the box respectively. we identied the
corresponding gauge theories above. for a special subclass of models we
were considering we can actually perform both. these geometries are those
whose toric diagram is given by two rows of k points. viewing them as zk
orbifolded conifolds ck, they (or better their blowup) turn into a box with 1
ns and k ns under tv . we can as well describe them as a gkk generalized
conifold and hence tu dualize them into an interval with k ns and k ns
branes. according to our philosophy these two ways of realizing the gauge
theory should actually be mirror to each other! we turned one hw setup
into its mirror branes.

now we can try to solve these gauge theories via the lift to m-theory.
interestingly enough, the intervals lift via susy 2-cycles in r6 while the
boxes lift via susy 3-cycles [31] in r6. so for every 3-cycle we should nd a
dual 2-cycle encoding the same information and vice versa.

6.2 putting together intervals and boxes

above we obtained an n = 1 d = 4 gauge theory from intervals in type iia
and boxes in type iib setups respectively. of course we can as well build a
box in type iia or an interval in type iib in order to obtain odd dimensional
gauge theories with 4 supercharges. the singular point should correspond to
having all ns branes coinciding.

we can do both together, that is put branes on the box and the interval
simultaneously, provided we put in enough ns branes so that we can open

31

up both, a box and an interval. from the dual geometry point of view this
corresponds to consider manifolds with both complex and kahler deforma-
tions turned on simultaneously. an interesting example is type iia with ns
012345, ns 012389, d4 01236, d4 01248. it is easy to convince oneself, that
this now lifts to m-theory via a susy 3-cycle in g2. that is we now break
another half of the susy, leaving us with 2 unbroken supercharges, or n = 1
in d = 3. note that this gauge theory actually only lives on the boxes, since
the interval theory is 4d while the box theory is 3d. things become more
interesting if we compactify the x3 direction. in this case both the interval
and the box give 3d gauge theories.

these brane setups t nicely into the framework of brane cubes. these
also lead to 2 supercharges. they lift via g2 and su(4) 4-cycle respectively
and are dual to probes on su(4) and g2 orbifold. now we have a 3rd kind
of brane setup in this league, which lifts via g2 3-cycle and should probably
also be dual to probes on a g2 singularity.

note that from the point of view of the four dimensional theory on the
d4 branes on the interval, the d4 branes on the box look like domain walls
(they are localized in x3). this is nice, since witten argued [21] before that
domain walls in d = 4, n = 1 gauge theory should be associated to m5
branes on g2 3-cycles.

7 summary

let us briey summarize the main results of the paper. for two classes of
non-compact (complex 3-dimensional) calabi-yau spaces we constructed the
t-dual ns brane congurations. specically blowups (resp. deformations)
of orbifolded conifold singularities, denoted by ckl, are tv dual to boxes
(resp.
intervals) of ns branes, whereas blowups (resp. deformations) of
generalized conifold singularities, called gkl, are tu dual to intervals (resp.
boxes) of ns branes. since the composition of tu and tv corresponds to a
t-duality with respect to three isometrical u(1) directions of m resp. w,
it should not come as a surprise that ckl and gkl are actually mirror pairs.
the kahler resp. complex structure parameters of the geometric singularities
correspond to positions of the ns branes in the dual brane picture. moreover
the conifold transition for the non-compact calabi-yau spaces ckl or gkl
via shrinking 2-cycles and growing up 3-cycles precisely corresponds to the
transition between the box and interval theory or vice versa, by rst moving

32

all ns branes on top of each other and then removing them into dierent
directions. all this is summarized in fig.8 below.

fig.8. the proposed picture.

constructing gauge theories from branes, the geometric singularities as
well as the ns brane congurations serve as backgrounds, which are probed
by a certain number of d branes. we have seen that the mirror map does
not change the corresponding gauge theories. at the conifold point some of
the gauge couplings go to innity.

in order to establish the duality between conifold singularities and brane
boxes we had to generalize the concept of brane boxes by also including
brane diamonds. we formulate rules for deriving the matter content of the
gauge theories living on boxes and diamonds. along a baryonic branch of
the gauge theory, which corresponds to partially resolving the conifolds ckl
to the orbifold singularities okl we recover the orbifold gauge theories from
our general rules.

blowups (or deformations) of certain geometries, namely c1k  gkk, allow
both for a dual brane box as well as for a dual interval description. it follows
that the corresponding gauge theory on the interval and on the brane box are
mirror to each other. this observation could be useful for the investigation of
the non-perturbative quantum dynamics of these kind of n = 1 gauge theo-
ries: namely for every supersymmetric 2-cycle which describes the dynamics

33

of the interval theory embedded in m-theory, there should exist a mirror su-
persymmetric 3-cycle for the brane box theory also embedded in m-theory.
it would be interesting to work out this mirror map between 2- and 3-cycles
explicitly. moreover one could expect that due to quantum corrections the
physics of the gauge theories at the conifold point is not as singular as in the
classical description we have discussed. finally, it would be also interesting
to relate the brane constructions of n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories,
considered here, to the geometric engineering approach, where various branes
are wrapped around non-trivial cycles of calabi-yau 4-folds or manifolds of
g2 holonomy.
