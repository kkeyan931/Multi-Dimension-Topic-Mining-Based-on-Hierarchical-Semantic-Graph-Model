we propose a unitary matrix formulation of type iib matrix model. one-loop eective action of

the model exhibits supersymmetry for bps background in the large n limit.

one of the most promising approaches towards a non-
perturbative formulation of string theory is the matrix
model [17]. for example, the action of the iib matrix
model [1,2] is nothing but a reduction [8] of n = 1 ten-
dimensional super yang mills theory:

sikkt = 

1
4

tr([a, a]2) 

1
2

tr [a, ].

(1)

while those matrix models, either so-called matrix the-
ory in iia language or the iib matrix model (also known
as the ikkt model) , are composed of hermite matri-
ces, there are several regions where models in terms of
unitary matrices would be preferable.

for example, to treat one of the space-time dimen-
sions with periodic boundary condition, one would have
to introduce innite copies of the original matrices and
end up with introducing a corresponding gauge eld [9].
studies along this line have been revealing many interest-
ing features of matrix models [10], especially the relation
with d-branes [11]. in those studies, the compactica-
tion procedure is needed to utilize the t-dual argument.
1 it would be useful if one could have a matrix model in
terms of unitary matrices,

u = eia,

(2)

in the rst place, since u apparently represents com-
pactied space (or time). we, then, acquire a coupling
constant in the theory, just as the emergence of the gauge
coupling constant in the hermite model upon conven-
tional compactication. therefore, for example, it would
be interesting to compare the result from the hermite case
[1214] with the unitary case in the numerical study.

there is another advantage of using a unitary matrix.
in matrix models, pairs of matrices which satisfy heisen-
berg algebra,

[p, q] =

2i
n

,

(3)

are used to construct bps states. there is no way to
represent the above algebra in terms of nite n  n her-
mite matrices. on the other hand, in terms of unitary
matrices,

u = eip,

v = eiq,

(4)

there is a well known representation in terms of nite
unitary matrices, namely the shift and clock matrices:

0
0

u =

(6)

therefore, we would have an explicit representation of
bps states in unitary matrix models regularized with -
nite n . also, one can speculate that the relation between
matrix models and noncommutative geometry [15] can be
more transparent in this manner.

despite all of those advantages that we can anticipate,
there is an obstruction in building unitary analogue of
matrix theory or the iib matrix model.

1in [12], the compactication of matrix models is considered
from a dierent view of point, that is, rather to explain the
real dimensionality of the world.

a naive attempt to rewrite matrix theory or the iib

matrix model in unitary matrices,

s = x tr(uuu 

u 

 ) +

i
2

tr (uu 


 u 

u),

(7)

immediately encounters a diculty [16,17]. in [16] the
unitary version of matrix theory is considered, and it
turnes out that the model does not possess supersym-
metry. this situation is the same for the iib case. the
action of the ikkt model (1) has enhanced n=2 super-
symmetry:

of the bosons instead of halving those of the fermions.
2 then, the one-loop eective action vanishes for bps
background in our unitary model.

first, let us calculate the one-loop eective action for
the naive unitary matrix model (7) for bps background.
we will see that the result, itself, suggests the modica-
tion which we propose here. the following calculation is
almost simple generalization of that of [1] to a unitary
case.

the general classical conguration u 0

 for unitary ma-
trices is characterized by the existence of a certain set of
unitary matrices eif 0
 , which satisfy the following rela-
tions with u 0
:

2 [a, a] 

(cid:26) (1) = i

(1)a = i,

(cid:26) (2) = 

(2)a = 0.

(8)

(9)

however, a naive generalization of the above algebra to
the unitary case,

u 0

u 0

 = u 0

 u 0

eif 0

 ,

[u 0

, eif 0

 ] = 0.

(11)

(12)

the above relations correspond to the following equations
of motion of hermite matrix model:

2 (uuu 

u 


 h.c.)

(1)u = i(u + u)

(cid:26) (1) = i

,(cid:26) (2) = 

(2)u = 0,

(10)

we now put

[a0

, a0

] = if 0

,

[f , a0

] = 0.

u = u 0

and integrate over x up to quadratic order. expanding
the bosonic part of the action,

uuu

(16)

in terms of x up to quadratic order yields

while the rst term in (17) simply gives an irrelevant con-
stant after x integration, the third term in (17) suggests
the following natural gauge xing term:

(u 0

(18)

f =x

the brs invariant action can be obtained by adding a
gauge xing term and a ghost term, as follows:

does not form the susy algebra. since this n=2 super-
symmetry in 10 dimensions is supposed to play an essen-
tial role to relate those models with gravity, the naive
unitary models are apparently unsatisfactory.

as a matter of fact, the lack of supersymmetry in the
above naive unitary models is somewhat obvious from
the beginning. when one regards the ikkt model as
the reduction of n=1 10d super yang mills theory in
the manner of eguchi-kawai [8] to zero dimension, they
can be seen as a model on a lattice with just one site.
the action written in terms of unitary matrices is sim-
ply the usual plaquett action. now, fermionic degrees of
freedom doubles in number when fermions are put on a
lattice. those so-called doublers break the equality in
the number of degrees of freedom between bosons and
fermions; thus there is no supersymmetry.

in [17], it was attempted to resolve this diculty by
employing the overlap formalism, which has been used
in a higher dimensional lattice model. the overlap for-
malism enables one to eliminate the unwanted doubler
degree of freedom of the fermions. while this procedure
cuts the degree of freedom of fermions by half, the super-
symmetry is still not manifest in this formalism.

in this note we propose another formulation of a uni-
tary matrix model of type iib. to accommodate su-
persymmetry we simply double the degrees of freedom

2we owe this idea to h. kawai.

the brs transformation for unitary matrices is

(21)

in the following we evaluate each quadratic integration
for the bps background, that is, for the case that f 0
 is
a c-number. it is useful to introduce a basis of n  n
hermite matrices t a which satises trt at b = ab.
in
terms of this basis x can be written as

x =x t axa

also, we dene the following matrix:

collecting all of the above result, we obtain the following

the above quantity is supposed to become a constant
if it is the eective partition function for supersymmet-
ric background. since we do not have supersymmetric
algebra for this model, it is rather the expected result.
however, the above result has a very suggestive form to
obtain a supersymmetric model.

first, obstruction to supersymmetry in (35) is cos f 0

term in the bosonic contribution. without it, the bosonic
contribution would have the same form as the ghost con-
tribution. to avoid that diculty, we perform the fol-
lowing analysis in 1/n expansion. we postulate that the
magnitude of f 0

 for the bps state is

f 0


 o(

).

the completeness of the hermite basis, (u2)ac = uabubc =
trt au 2t c(u )2. taking care of the numerical factor 1

by normalizing the fermionic part, we obtain a unitary
matrix model, which exhibits supersymmetry at the one-
loop level in the large n limit:

z d(u)2d exp[x tr(u 2

 (u 

)2(u 

 )2)

ix tr (uu 



 u 

u)].

(45)

the above expression (45) summarizes the main re-
sult of the present paper. a few remarks are in order:
first, the above expression vanishes for the bps states
only in the large n limit. for example, consider the case
f 0
 = 0; namely, the case that u 0
 commutes with each
other. in that case that there exist n fermion zero modes
to be integrated out, which produce non-trivial interac-
tions between the eigenvalues of the matrices in the her-
mite case [12,18]. since total number of integration is n 2,
the contribution from those zero modes yields o(1/n ),
nonvanishing subleading term. the analysis of fermion
zero modes for more general backgrounds involves some
technical issues so we left it for future study. second, we
were unable to nd a supersymmetric transformation of
the classical action of (45). therefore, the supersymme-
try shown here seems to be only at the one-loop level. it
would be interesting to see whether supersymmetry per-
sists at the two-loop order. also, the calculation for a
more general background like the block diagonal back-
ground is rather straightforward. third, there will be
other mappings from hermite matrices to unitary ones
than that in (2). for example, (i + ia/2)(i  ia/2)1
also leads to a unitary matrix.
in this case, however,
the relation between the hermite model and the unitary
one becomes more complicated. lastly, we seem to need
the postulation (36) to obtain the supersymmetric states,
that is, bps state. since the postulation (36) is related
with the scaling which we are taking, the better under-
standing of the physical meaning of the above postulation
would be desired.

in summary we have proposed a new formulation of
the iib matrix model in terms of unitary matrices, (45).
the model has a vanishing one-loop eective action for
the bps states in the large n limit. we hope that we can
shed more light on the issues addressed above in future
publications.

acknowledgments: we would like to thank h.
kawai for the collaboration at the early stage of the
project and for illuminating discussions. we have also
greatly benetted from countless discussions with h.
aoki, n. ishibashi, s. iso, h. itoyama, y. kitazawa, t.
suyama and colleagues in the kek theory group.

eqs. (5) and (6) provide an example of non-commuting
pair of unitary matrices that satisfy (36), which may seem
to lead commuting pair of matrices in the large n limit
at rst sight. then, in the 1/n expansion

cos f 0

 = 1 + o(

1
n 2 )

(37)

for the general bps background. note that for the back-
ground of diagonal matrices, that is, for the f 0
 = 0
case, cos f 0
 = 1 without the subleading contribution of
1/n . also, we expect the contribution of o(1/n ) from
the integration over fermion zero modes. therefore, the
one-loop partition function up to the leading order of
1/n is

(detx (cid:0)2  u0

one can now see that the above expression would become
a constant by cancelling each factor from the denomina-

corresponds to integration with the measure d(u)2.
