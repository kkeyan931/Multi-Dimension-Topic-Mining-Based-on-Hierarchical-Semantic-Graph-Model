i. introduction

the notion of absolute parallelism or teleparallelism was introduced by einstein [1] when he tried to unify gravitation
and electromagnetism. a transcription of the dirac equation as a set of equations for an antisymmetric tensor eld was
introduced by mathematician e. kahler [2](see also [3]).this kahler-dirac equation has been studied in connection
with lattice fermions [4],[5] and other remarkable properties [6]-[10]. as it was suggested by graf [6] the kahler eld
might be more fundamental than the dirac spinor. this is an appealing idea because it conforms to the einstein
methodology of associating all physical elds with geometrical objects.

here, the kahler-dirac equation on the weitzenbock space-time [11] characterized by the vanishing curvature
tensor (absolute parallelism) and by the torsion tensor formed of four parallel vector elds (parallel frames ) is
studied. motivation for our consideration is the known fact that orthonormal frames are necessary for description
of gravitational interactions of fermions in the framework of the usual spinor formalism. to investigate the role of
frames in the kahler formalism, it is natural to consider the kahler-dirac equation on the weitzenbock space-time.
our main result is the consistent system of equations (1),(2),(3),(4) for the kahler elds and parallel vector elds with
16 degrees of freedom dened by the internal symmetry inherent in the kahler-dirac equation on the weitzenbock
space-time. we do not consider the physical interpretation of the equations derived because at that time it was absent
for the kahler eld on a more familiar riemann space-time, but the results of our consideration may be useful for
solving this problem.

the weitzenbock space-time admits a quadruplet of linearly independent parallel vector elds h

solving these equations, we nd the non-symmetric connexion,

the covariant antisymmetric tensor eld f1 p

(p = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) is called the p-form. if

f = (f, f, f, f, f)

is an inhomogeneous form,(i.e. kahler eld) the generalized curl operator de is dened by

def = (0, df, 2d[f], 3d[f], 4d[f]),

where d =  + s, the covector s is equal to the contraction of the torsion tensor s = s
denote alternation. for the operator di of generalized divergence we have the following denition

 . square brackets

the kahler-dirac equation on the weitzenbock space-time is of the form

dif = (d f , d f , d f , d f , 0).

df =

mc
h

f,

(2.1)

where d = di + de.

similar to the operators di and de one can introduce the operators qi and qe dened by the vector eld u as

follows

qef = (0, uf, 2u[f], 3u[f], 4u[f]),

if in additional to these operators, we introduce a numerical operator  such that

qif = (u f , u f , u f , u f , 0).

f = (f, f, f, f, f),

then it can be shown that the operator q = (qi  qe) commutes with the operator d under the condition u = 0.
thus, the operator q acts in the space of the solutions of equation (1) if u = uih

i , where ui are constants.

this internal symmetry of equation (1) immediately gives the tensor

j  = x

which on the solutions of equation (1) satises the equation

( + 2s )j   = 0.

(2.2)

to prove this, let

after some calculations it can be shown that

(f, h) = x

(df + mf, h)  (f, dh + mh) =

where r = (f, h) and

(f, h) = x

p=0

p!

( f1 p h 1 p  f  1 p h1 p).

from this equality it follows that if f and h are solutions to equation (1), then the vector r = (f, h) satises the
equation

substitution h = qf gives

which proves the statement.

( + 2s )r = 0.

(f, qf ) = uj  ,

iii. equation for parallel vector fields

since the tensor j   has 16 components, one can write the consistent system of equations for 16 functions h
i

e = lj 

(3.1)

provided that from the components of h
which satises the equation

i and their rst and second derivatives one can construct the tensor e

( + 2s )e  = 0

identically. it is remarkable that a tensor like that really exists.

let

s = g gs

 .

from the commutator of covariant derivatives

it follows that

 s   s = 2s
 

s

the right hand side of this equality admits following representation. the identity for general linear connexion [12]

( s + s

 s ) = s s

 .

in our case (r . = 0) gives

r[ ]. = 2[s
 ]

 4s

[ s

]

s

  +  s

 + s

 =

2s

 s

 + 2s

 s

 + 2s

s

 .

from this one derives by contraction

thus,

s

  =  s + s  2ss

 .

s s

  = (2s s)  2s( s + s

 s ).

after substitution in to the starting equality we get

( s + s

 s  + 2ss) =

2s(s + s

 s  + 2ss).

and hence the tensor

e = s + s

 s  + 2ss

(3.2)

satises equation (2) identically.

thus, we have proved that the system of equations (1),(2),(3),(4) is consistent.
since the tensors j  and e have dimensions cm3 nd respectively cm2, then the constant l in equation (3)
has the dimension of length. it is natural to suppose that l is equal to the planck length. it should be noted also that
the 00-component of the tensor j  is positive denite.

thus, the connection is established between the theory of kahler fermions and the spaces with teleparallelism,

expressed by the system of equations (1),(2),(3),(4).
