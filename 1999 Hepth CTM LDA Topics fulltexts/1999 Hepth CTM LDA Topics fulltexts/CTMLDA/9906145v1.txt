abstract

we review a detailed investigation of the perturbative part of the low-energy eective action
of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory in a conventional eective eld theory approach.
with the restriction that the eective action should contain at most two derivatives and not
more than four-fermion couplings, the features of the low-energy eective action obtained by
seiberg based on u (1)r anomaly and non-perturbative -function arguments are shown to
emerge.

introduction

the understanding to non-perturbative dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theory has made rapid
progress in recent years following the seminal contribution by seiberg and witten[1], combining
the ideas of holomorphicity[2] and duality[3]. the web of arguments leading to the explicit
results consists of a skillful combination of perturbative and nonperturbative arguments, formal
considerations and physical reasoning. it should be checked by explicit computations, whenever
possible, that no unexpected failure of these arguments occurs. in a recent work we have made
an investigation in this direction[4] and this paper is intended as a review.

the starting point in seiberg and wittens work is the low-energy eective action of an n = 2

supersymmetric yang-mills theory with the gauge group su (2) of the following form,

g2 is the modular parameter and  the n = 2 chiral supereld describing the
light degrees of freedom. the logarithmic term represents the one-loop perturbative result and
was rst obtained by di vecchia et al.[5] in a calculation where they coupled the gauge supereld
to an n = 2 matter supermultiplet and integrated out the latter. subsequently, seiberg[2]
used the anomalous transformation behaviour under u (1)r and holomorphicity to argue that
the full low-energy eective action should take the form (1), where the innite series arises from
nonperturbative instanton contributions. the seiberg-witten solution [1] gives the explicit form
of this part of .

the form (1) has been conrmed by calculations in n = 1 superspace and in harmonic
superspace, extending the result to nonleading terms in the number of derivatives [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
independent conrmation has been obtained from m -theory [11].

our intention is to check the perturbative part of the eective action in wess-zumino gauge
by a very down-to-earth calculation. in the higgs phase of the theory, the su (2) gauge symmetry
breaks down to u (1), and the super-higgs mechanism splits the supermultiplet into a massive one
and a massless one. the eective action of the massless elds should be obtained by integrating
out the heavy elds. in comparison with other approaches, our method is quite conventional and
is along the lines of the standard denition of the low-energy eective theory.

it should be emphasized that this conventional calculation is very complicated. even this
modest programme we cannot carry out fully. what we have actually accomplished is the com-
putation of the heavy fermion determinant. reassuringly, we nd that the form (1) is reproduced.
although no unexpected surprises were unearthed by our calculation, we still hope that it has
some pedagogical value in showing explicitly how the eective action arises.

the outline of this review is as follows.

in section 2 we describe the model and exhibit
the higgs mechanism. section 3 contains the computation of the heavy fermion determinant
using the constant eld approximation. the detailed calculations of the fermion eigenvalues and
their degeneracies, which contain certain subtle points, are given in appendix b. in section 4 we
present a discussion of the results. in the pedagogical vein of this paper, we give in appendix a
the component form of the low-energy eective action (1).

the bosonic part of the action (2) is just the georgi-glashow model in the bogomolnyi-prasad-
sommereld (bps) limit. in addition to the fermionic term and yukawa interaction term, this
action has the scalar potential

v () =

at one-loop level, the integration over the heavy modes will lead to the determinants of the dy-
namical operators. in practical calculation we cannot evaluate the determinant exactly. here we
shall employ a technique called constant eld approximation to compute the determinant, which
was invented by schwinger[13] and later was used in in [5] and [14] to extract the anomaly term in
n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory and the one-loop eective action of the supersymmetric
cp n1 model. to apply this method we rst rewrite the the quadratic part of the classical action
(20) as

squad = stree +z d4x(cid:16)mbb + emf b + mbfe + emf fe(cid:17) ,

e = stree  ihtr ln mf f  tr ln(mbb  mbf m1

(27)

(28)

the following task is to evaluate the above determinants. let us rst consider the fermionic

part. since mf f has the form of a reducible matrix,

det mf f =

1
16

(det f )2(detef )2 =

exp[2(tr ln f + tr ln detef )].

now we switch on the constant eld approximation to work out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
the above operators and further evaluate the determinant. we choose only the third components
of the electric and magnetic elds to be the constants dierent from zero,

 e3 = f 036=0, b3 = f 126=0,

and  the non-vanishing constant eld. consequently, the potential becomes

a1 = f 12x2, a3 = f 30x0, a0 = a2 = 0.

to get the eigenvalues of the operators, it is necessary to rotate into euclidean space,


x4 = x4 = ix0, 0 =
x4 ,
f 34 = f34 = if 30, f 12 = f12 = f 12.


x0 = i

let us rst consider det f . the eigenvalue equation for f is

f (x) =(cid:20)id

(32)

where  is a four-component spinor wave function. in order to get normalizable eigenstates, we
consider the system in a box of nite size l in the x1 and x3 directions with periodic boundary
conditions, so the eigenvector should be of the following form,

(x) =

1
l

eip1x1eip3x3(x2, x4),

p1 =

2l
l

, p3 =

2k
l

, k, l = integers.

(33)

to nd the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we write the operators and the wave function in two-
component forms,

f =  g(2 + v)1

+



g(2 + v)1 ! ,  =  1
2 ! ,

(34)

7

where 1 is the 22 identity matrix and

 = 4i [1(1 + igf12x2) + 22 + 3(3 + igf34x4)] .

the eigenvalue equation (32) is thus reduced to the following set of equations,

 g(2 + v)1 + 2 = 1,
+1  g(2 + v)2 = 2,

and now

 = 4[1(p1 + gf12x2)  i22 + 3(p3 + gf34x4)].

(35)

(36)

(37)

a detailed calculation and discussion of the eigenvalues are collected in appendix b. we obtain
two series of eigenvalues,

(m, n) = g(cid:20) ( + )
2

+ v(cid:21)r 1

2

g2(  )2  2mgf12  2ngf34,

(38)

where for m1, n1 both eigenvalues are doubly degenerate, while (m.0) and (0, n) are
nondegenerate, and for m = n = 0, there exists only a nondegenerate eigenvalue (0, 0).

in a similar way we can solve the eigenvalue equation

(39)

(40)

and obtain the eigenvalues,

e(m, n) = g(cid:20) ( + )

the s. there still only exists a nondegenerate eigenvalue (0, 0).

the degeneracies of e(m, n), e(m, 0) and e(0, n) with m1, n1 are the same as those of
with the above eigenvalues tr ln f and tr lnef can be computed straightforwardly,

tr ln f = ln det f = lnh(lk)(m, n)ir

=

+xl,k=

xm,n=0

r ln (lk)(m, n),

(41)

where r is the degeneracy of (m, n). due to the relation x2 = 2l/(gf12l) and x4 =
2k/(gf34l), the summation over the momenta k and l is actually equivalent to an integra-
tion over x2 and x4. since the elds are constants, this integration will yield only a euclidean
space volume factor, which tends to innity in the continuous limit (l),

in constant eld approximation,  and  can be regarded grassman numbers, so we can expand
the bosonic determinant only to the quartic terms in  and . now the key problem is how to
nd the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the operator matrix mbb  mbf m1
f f mf b. if they could
be worked out, then with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of fermionic operator, we can use the
technique developed in [5] to evaluate this determinant. unfortunately, it seems to us that in the
constant eld approximation it is very to nd the eigenvalues and eigenstates of such a horrible
operator matrix. this diculty is waiting to be overcome.

despite the fact that the bosonic part cannot be evaluated, we can see from (27) and (52)
that the eective lagrangian associated with the fermionic part has already shown the features
of the perturbative part of the low-energy eective action. first, we believe that the quadratic
divergence of eq.(52) will be canceled owing to the nonrenormalization theorem. second, for the
logarithmic divergence of eq.(52), with

z

eq.(52) shows that the wilson eective action has one term proportional to

f f  ln" g2(2 + v)(2 + v)

2

# .

(54)

(55)

comparing with the component eld form given by (a.13), we can conclude that the complete
calculation should give the form (1) of the low-energy eective action. one can even guess

11

this from the requirement of supersymmetry since the constant eld approximation and the
proper-time regularization preserve the supersymmetry explicitly. further, there is a nite term

proportional to f ef lnh(2 + v)/(2 + v)i in (52). as pointed out in [5], this is the reection

of the axial u (1)r anomaly in the eective action. this anomaly term had played a crucial role
in the nonperturbative analysis[2].

4 summary

in summary, we have tried to calculate the perturbative part of the low-energy eective action
of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory based on a standard eective eld theory technique.
it is well known that the seiberg-witten eective action is the cornerstone for all those new
developments in n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory, and that this eective action has been
obtained in an indirect way. therefore, it is worthwhile to try to compute this eective action
using a straightforward integration of the heavy degrees of freedom. unfortunately, we have
encountered an insurmountable diculty in evaluating the bosonic operator adopting the constant
eld approximation. this prevents us from getting the complete result and giving a thorough
comparison with the form of (1). however, the calculation of the fermionic determinant has
indeed shown the basic features of the low-energy eective action. this gives a partial verication
of the abstract symmetry analysis in extracting the low-energy eective action. the complete
calculation presents an interesting problem for further investigation.

b eigenvalues of the fermionic operator

in this appendix we present a detailed calculation on the eigenvalues of fermionic operator f .
first eq.(36) implies

+1(x2, x4) = h + g(2 + v)ih + g(2 + v)i 1(x2, x4),
+2(x2, x4) = h + g(2 + v)ih + g(2 + v)i 2(x2, x4)

with

+ = h12  h34 + g3(f12  f34),

eigenvector of + and + to nd the ones of f . as the usual operator method dealing
with the harmonic oscillator, dening the destruction and creation operators

4. gf12 < 0, gf34 > 0; 12 = gf12, 34 = gf34;

now we look for the eigenvalues of f with aid of the eigenvalues of + and +. from
eq.(b.1) we have

+|1i = h + g(2 + v)ih + g(2 + v)i |1i,
+|2i = h + g(2 + v)ih + g(2 + v)i |2i.

16

(b.11)

the eigenstates 1i and |2i should be the following form,

|ii  |k, li

|m, ni ! ,

i = 1, 2,

(b.12)

where |k, li|ki|li, |m, ni|mi|ni, k, m are the quantum numbers of the harmonic oscillator h12
and l, n are those of h34.

we rst consider the case 1, since that

the common eigenstate of + and + with eigenvalue 2m12  2n34, m, n1 is

where , ,  and  are normalization parameters. with this eigenstate, we rewrite the eigenvalue
equation (36) in fock space,

eqs.(b.16) and (b.17) explicitly show that +(m, n) and (m, n) with m, n1 are doubly de-
generate, since for a 44 matrix there should exist four eigenvalues. special attention should be
paid to the cases of m = 0 or n = 0 as well as both of them equal to zero, when we will see that
the degeneracies of the eigenvalue are dierent:

 m1, n = 0:

in this case the eigenvalue equation (b.15) will reduce to the following form,

the eigenvalues (m, 0) are obviously nondegenerate.

in a similar way, one can see that the eigenvalues (m, n), (m, 0), (0, n) with m, n1 and
their degeneracies are the same as the case 1 except that (0, 0) is dierent,

(0, 0) = g(2 + v) = +(0, 0).
