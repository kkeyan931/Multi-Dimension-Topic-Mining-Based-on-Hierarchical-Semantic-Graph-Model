abstract

the total space of the spinor bundle on the four dimensional sphere s4 is a

quaternionic line bundle that admits a metric of spin(7) holonomy.

fwe con-

sider octonionic yang-mills instanton on this eight dimensional gravitational in-

stanton. this is a higher dimensional generalization of (anti-)self-dual instanton

on the eguchi-hanson space. we propose an ansatz for spin(7) yang-mills eld

and derive a system of non-linear ordinary dierential equations. the solutions

are classied according to the asymptotic behavior at innity. we give a complete

solution, when the gauge group is reduced to a product of su (2) subalgebras in

spin(7). the existence of more general spin(7) valued solutions can be seen by

making an asymptotic expansion.

1 introduction

instantons and soliton solutions have played a prominent role in our understanding of

non-perturbative dynamics and dualities in gauge eld theories and string theory. it has

been observed that fundamental examples of topological solutions are associated with

the four hopf brations of spheres, which in turn are related to the division algebras of

real numbers r, complex numbers c, quaternions h and octonions o [1][2]. the kink

solution in 1+1 dimensions, the dirac monopole in three dimensions and the su(2) yang-

mills instanton in four dimensions correspond to the rst three algebras. in this paper

we will bring into focus eight dimensional instantons that corresponds to the octonions.

if the theory is promoted to a supersymmetric (susy) theory, these topological so-

lutions obtain a new feature. that is, they are characterized as bps states that preserve

a fraction of susy. roughly speaking a rst order soliton equation is a square root

of the equation of motion for bosons and hence appears in the susy transformations

of fermions. solutions that make the susy variation of fermions vanishing give purely

bosonic congrations which preserve (or break) some portions of supersymmetry. it is

interesting that there is also a relation between the four division algebras and the exis-

tence of supersymmetric pure yang-mills theory and superstring theory in d = 3, 4, 6, 10

[3][4]. thus we see there are amusing links among instanton, supersymmetry and the

division algebra. from this viewpoint octonionic instanton that will be featured in the

following is related to susy yang-mills and superstring theory in ten dimensions.

topological quantum eld theories enter naturally in these connections. especially,

topological yang-mills theories in two and four dimensions are, respectively, associated

with the complex numbers and the quaternions. furthermore, one can construct an eight

dimensional cohomological yang-mills theory based the octonionic instanton equation

[5][6], though it makes sense only on a manifold of restricted holonomy. it is promising

that this brst cohomological theory probes the moduli space of the octonionic instanton

equation. but how this is achieved actually depends on our nding an appropriate

compactication of the moduli space.

in the case of four dimensional instantons we

need the point-like (ideal) instantons to compactify the moduli space. in [7] it has been

argued that a natural higher dimensional analogue of ideal (point-like) instanton is that

lives on the normal bundle over a supersymmetric cycle (or a calibrated submanifold)

that has codimension four. this argument gives a good motivation for looking at higher

1

dimensional instanton on the r4 bundle.

fortunately an eight dimensional metric that is prepared for this purpose has been
it is a metric of spin(7) holonomy on the r4 bundle
provided in [8], [9] and [10].
over s4, which is an example of a quaternionic line bundle over a quaternionic kahler

manifold. in this paper we consider the octonionic yang-mills instanton on this spin(7)

holonomy manifold. as will be shown in the next section this metric is a natural eight

dimensional generalization of the eguchi-hanson metric. the geometry of quaternions

replaces the role of complex numbers in the eguchi-hanson space whose global structure
is the canonical line bundle over the complex projective space p1(c) = s2. thus we can
say that our instanton is a higher dimensional generalization of anti-self-dual instanton

on the ale space.

it is known that the spinor bundle over a four dimensional spin

manifold has spin(7) holonomy in general. the quaterninonic line bundle in this paper
is identied with the spinor bundle over s4 (see appendix a).

the paper is organized as follows; in section two we introduce the metric of gibbons-

page-pope and set up notations that are necessary in the following sections. the metric

of spin(7) holonomy is a solution to the octonionic self-duality for spin connections.

we show that the same condition is obtained as a ow equation in a susy quantum

mechanics of weight functions appearing in our ansatz of the metric.

in a course of

explaining the implication of the octonionic self-duality, some algebraic properties of

spin(7) as a subalgebra of so(8) are reviewed briey. we propose our ansatz for spin(7)

yang-mills eld in section three, and write down the octonionic yang-mills instanton

equation. to solve the instanton equation we rst make a classication of solutions

according to the asymptotic behavior at innity and nd six classes. there are reduced

solutions in the sense that the actual gauge group is reduced to a direct product of

su(2) factors in spin(7). for these class of solutions we present almost complete answer

in section four. unfortunately for other solutions we are not able to nd solutions in

analytically closed form. in section ve we perform asympototic expansion to see the

existence of general solutions. the nal section is devoted to discussion. we point out

the relation to seven dimensional chern-simons theory. we also make a remark on the

energy-momentum tensor of higher dimensional yang-mills instantons.

2 gravitational instanton in eight dimensions

we rst derive a metric of spin(7) holonomy from the viewpoint of supersymmetric

quantum mechanics. this metric was originally obtained by gibbons-page-pope [8][9]
and further discussed in [10]. we take the following ansatz for a metric on the r4 bundle
over s4

where

ds2 = f 2dr2 + g2ds2 + h2(i  ai)2 ,

ds2 = d2 +

1
4

sin2  2

i

(2.1)

(2.2)

is the standard metric on the base space s4. we assume that f, g and h are functions of

the radial coordinate r. i and i are left-invariant one-form of su(2) manifold;

di = 

1
2

ijkj  k ,

di = 

1
2

ijkj  k .

(2.3)

note that su(2) = sp(1) is the space of quaternions with unit norm. finally ai repre-
sents the basic su(2) instanton on s4;

ai = cos2 

2  i .

the vielbein (orthonormal frame) of the above metric is

ei =

1
2

g(r) sin   i ,
e7 = f (r)dr ,

ei = h(r) (i  ai) ,
e8 = g(r)d ,

(2.4)

(2.5)

where i = 1, 2, 3 and i = 4, 5, 6 = 1, 2, 3. the indices (1, 2, 3, 8) are for the base space
s4 and (4, 5, 6, 7) are those for the bre. this metric is a special case of more general

class of metric on the quaternionic line bundle over a quaternionic kahler manifold.
note that s4 = p1(h) is not a kahler but a quaternionic kahler manifold.
any four dimensional manifold is quaternionic kahler. the eguchi-hanson metric is a

in fact

four dimensional gravitational instanton on a (complex) line bundle over the complex

projective space p1(c). more precisely the global topology of the eguchi-hanson space
is the cotangent bundle t (p1(c)) which coincides with the canonical bundle. hence, the
above metric is a higher dimensional generalization of the eguchi-hanson metric obtained

by simply replacing the complex numbers with the quaternions (see also appendix a).

to be diagonal;

and  denotes the dierentiation. the volume form of the manifold is given by

e1  e2      e8 = f g4h3dr  ds 7 ,

where ds 7 is the volume form of the sphere s7. we obtain the einstein-hilbert action;

z rgd8x = vols 7  (t + v ) ,
t =z f 1dr(cid:16)12(g)2g2h3 + 6(h)2g4h + 24(gh)g3h2(cid:17)
v =z f dr(cid:18)12g2h3 

g4h  3h5(cid:19) .

(2.9)

(2.10)

note that we are going to regard the radial coordinate r as a time and hence the

relative sign of the kinetic term and the potential term in the action is changed due to

the euclidean time. with this interpretation the function f (r) is a gauge freedom of

time reparametrization.

in fact we would be able to impose a gauge xing condition

f = 1. hence the physical variables are g = g(r) and h = h(r). the (sigma model)

metric determined from the kinetic term t is

ggg = 24f 1g2h3 , ggh = ghg = 24f 1g3h2 , ghh = 12f 1g4h .

(2.11)

now we are ready to make a crucial observation that the present model can be identied

as a bosonic part of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (0 + 1 dimensional susy sigma

model). the point is that introducing the superpotential

w = 3g4h2 + 6g2h4 ,

(2.12)

4

we can write the potential term in the form;

v =

1
2

gij w
qi

w
qj

,

(2.13)

where (q1, q2) = (g, h) and gij is the inverse of the metric. the equation of motion from
the hamiltonian3 h = t  v of susy quantum mechanics

(2.14)

(2.15)

d
dr

qi = gij w

qj

gives the following ow equations;

k =

g
f g

2

h
g2 , l =

f h

2h

= 

=

h
g2 .

if we introduced fermionic variables that are susy partners to (q1, q2) = (g, h), these

equations would be equivalent to the condition that susy variations of the fermionic

coordinates vanish and hence determine a purely bosonic conguration that is invari-

ant under supersymmetry. we observe that (2.15) coincides with the condition of the

octonionic self-duality of the riemann curvature, which shows the bps nature of the

octonionic self-duality. using (2.6) and (2.15), we can see that a solution to the above

equation gives a ricci-at metric.

in [10] the equations (2.15) are derived from the self-duality on the spin connection

ab =

1
2

abcdcd ,

(2.16)

where a totally antisymmetric tensor abcd is dened in appendix b in terms of the
structure constants of octonions.
imposed with a gauge condition on g(r) instead of

f (r), the equations (2.15) were solved as follows;

f (r) = 1 (cid:18)m

r (cid:19)10/3!1/2

,

g(r)2 =

20
h(r) =
we note that f (r) satises the equation

3note again that the change of the relative sign in the euclidean time.

rf (r) =

3

f (1  f 2) .

5

(2.17)

(2.18)

in eight dimensions the spin connection  is so(8) valued. let ab be a generator of
so(8). the tensor abcd obeys the identity (b.5) which implies

abpqcdpq = 6(c

ac
ad
b  d
b)  4 cd
this identity means that if we regard  cd
as a linear map d on so(8) algebra, then
the eigenvalues of (1/2)d are 1 and 3. since dim so(8) = 28 and d is traceless, we
get the eigenspace decomposition;

(2.19)

.

ab

ab

so(8) = e(1)  e(3) ,

(dim e(1) = 21) ,

(2.20)

where e(1) coincides with spin(7) subgroup of so(8) [11]. the orthogonal projection

operator to each eigenspace is

p1 =

4(cid:18)1 +

1
6

d(cid:19) , p3 =

1

4(cid:18)1

2

d(cid:19) .

we obtain the following generator of spin(7)

which satises the constraint

gab =

3

4(cid:18)ab +

1
6

abcdcd(cid:19) ,

gab 

1
2

abcdgcd = 0 .

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

the algebra so(8) has four mutually commuting su(2) subalgebras with the following

generators;

si = (8i +

u i = (7i +

1
2
1
2

ijkjk), t i = (8i 
ijkjk),
v i = (7i 

1
2
1
2

ijkjk),

ijkjk).

(2.24)

(2.25)

by comparing the dynkin diagrams of so(8) and spin(7), we see that spin(7) is obtained

by identifying two of su(2) subalgebras which correspond to the outer nodes of so(8)
diagram. indeed the constraint (2.23) implies an identication of si  u i, that is su(2)
in the base direction and that along the bre (the normal direction) are identied4.
since abab = ab(p1 + p3)ab = abgab + p3abab, we can regard an so(8) valued
connection with the octonionic self-duality p3ab = 0 as spin(7) valued. thus the

4this is denetely related to the topological twist on the world volume of susy cycles [12].

6

self-duality (2.16) of the spin connection imposed in [10] is just the requirement that 

is spin(7) valued. in fact we can prove that the cayley four form

 =

1
4!

abcdea  eb  ec  ed ,

(2.26)

is closed, if the spin connection satises the self-duality (2.16). the closedness of the

cayley four form is equivalent to the condition of spin(7) holonomy [13][14]. the total
space of the quaternionic line bundle on s4 with the metric given by (2.17) is a manifold

of spin(7) holonomy.

3 ansatz for spin(7) connection

now we consider the octonionic instanton on a spin(7) bundle over the gpp-bfk metric

(octonionic gravitational instanton), which we would like to propose as a higher dimen-

sional generalization of su(2) instanton on the eguchi-hanson metric (four dimensional

gravitational instanton.) in the four dimensional case, the spin connection of the eguchi-

hanson metric satises the self-duality condition with respect to internal su(2) indices

and this implies the curvature two form satises the self-duality on space-time indices

as well as internal ones. thus we can obtain an example of yang-mills instanton by the

standard embedding of the spin connection into the yang-mills connection. the same

thing takes place for spin(7) case in eight dimensions due to the basic identity for the

structure constants of octonions. (for su(2) case in the above the corresponding ob-

ject is ijk; the structure constants of the quaternions.) for the standard emdedding of
spin(7) connections, see appendix b.

we now try to nd more general spin(7) instantons other than the one obtained by

the standard embedding. motivated by the form of spin connection of gpp-bfk metric,

we take the following ansatz for spin(7) connection

ek + y ek! ijk

aij =  (x + y )ek +

cot

g

ek! ijk

a8i =

aij =  1
aij = z(cid:16)ijkek + ije8(cid:17)
a8i =zei
a7i = (3z)ei

a87 = (3z)e8
a7i = (x  y )ei ,

7

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

where x(r), y (r), z(r) are unknown functions of the radial coordinate r. for the spin

connection we have

x(r) =

1

2h(r) 

h(r)
2g(r)2 ,

y (r) = z(r) =

h(r)
2g(r)2 .

since this ansatz satises the octonionic self-duality

aab =

1
2

abcdacd ,

(3.5)

(3.6)

with respect to the lie algebra indices, we can consistently regard the connection a =
1
4gabaab as spin(7) valued. we also note that the vielbein of radial direction e7 does not
appear, hence if we think of the radial coordinate as a time, we are in the temporal

gauge.

due to the identity obeyed by the component of the calibration four form or the
structure constant of octonions, the curvature f = da + a  a satises the same self-
duality as the connection and hence it is also spin(7) valued. (that is, we can compute

the curvature as if a was so(8) connection.) we obtain the following curvature;

in the case of the riemannian curvature which comes from the metric the symmetry of

four indices implies that the octonionic self-duality as a space-time two form follows from

that of so(8) indices. however, for the yang-mills curvature the octonionic instanton

equation [15][16][7];

 f =   f ,

(3.16)

is independent of the self-duality of f with respect to the lie algebra indices which only

implies that it is spin(7) valued. thanks to the cyclic symmetry of su(2) indices in our

ansatz, the octonionic self-dualty of the curvature two-from is greatly reduced. we nd

at the critical points of u, we nd the list of the critical points and the morse indices

octonionic yang-mills instantons and classify the solutions of (4.4)-(4.6) according to

sol(pi) := {a family of solutions approaching to pi for r   }.

and sol(p4), respectively. when z 6= 0 it is dicult to nd general solutions, which will
be discussed in more detail in the next section, but we here present a special solution in

the spin connection (4.12) yields a spin(7) connection, while as we will see shortly

the connection of (4.11) takes the value in a sub-lie algebra of spin(7). in this sense
(4.11) is a reduced solution. let us calculate the curvature two-form f = 1

it is easy to see that si, t i and u i are mutually commuting su(2) generators which

satisfy the relations

[si, sj] = ijksk, [t i, t j] = ijkt k, [u i, u j] = ijku k.

(4.20)

thus the solution (4.11) describes the su(2)3 octonionic yang-mills instanton. when

the parameters (a, b) take the special values, some curvature components vanish:

fi(y ) = 0 for (a,),
fi(x) = 0 for (, b),
for (,).

fi(x) = fi(y ) = 0

(4.21)

(4.22)

(4.23)

the gauge group is then further reduced to su(2)2 and su(2) in the case of (4.21) or

(4.22) and (4.23), respectively.

we now evaluate the chern forms characterizing the topological nature of the solution

(4.11). the relevant closed forms are given by

c2 =

1
82 tr f  f,

1

c4 =

1284 ((tr f  f )(tr f  f )  2 tr f  f  f  f ),

(4.24)

(4.25)

where tr refers to the adjoint representation of su(2)3. since c2 is a four-form, it must
be integrated over a four-dimensional hypersurface in the quaternionic line bundle. a
natural choice is the bre r4, which is specied by the orthonormal frame {e4, e5, e6, e7}.
using (4.11), (4.17) and (4.19), we obtain the formula

5 asymptotic expansion

as we have mentioned it is dicult to obtain a solution with z 6= 0 in a closed form. the
only exceptional solution is given by the spin connection regarded as a spin(7) gauge

eld. to investigate the existence of more general solutions let us look for a solution

in a form of formal power series. we rst consider the exponent of the power series

determined by the gradient ow equation. linearizing the equation (4.7) around the

critical point pi, we have

d

dtea = fhabeb,

(5.1)

where fhab represents the 3  3 matrix achcb evaluated at pi. to be specic, let
1, 2,   be the positive eigenvalues of fh and a(pi) the critical values. then, the

gradient ow approaching to pi may be expanded in the form

a = a(pi) + aa

r!2
2   b
for a large radial coordinate. here coecients aa
2 , are determined by the linearized
gradient ow equation (5.1) and a, b,   are 3  index(pi) free parameters . recall that
the gradient ow gives an approximate solution, and hence the expansion (5.2) must be

1 (cid:18)a
r(cid:19)1

+   

1 , aa

+ aa

(5.2)

corrected by the exact octonionic yang-mills equation. the correction comes from the

13

last term (f 2  1)z in (4.6), which is also expanded by using

f 2 =

xn=0(cid:18)m

r (cid:19)10n/3

.

(5.3)

now we make an ansatz of the formal power series which takes into acount of the asymp-

totic behavior described above:

r(cid:17)1

, z1 =(cid:16) a
where w =(cid:16) m
  . this series will provide the asymptotic
expansion of the octonionic yang-mills instanton in sol(pi) with totally 4  index(pi)
moduli parameters, if the parameter m of the background metric is treated as a moduli.

6 discussion

firstly we remark the relationship betweeen the asymptotic ow (4.7) and the chern-
simons theory over the squashed seven sphere s7. a similar relation in various dimensions
has been discussed in [17]. the gravitational instanton metric (2.1) has the conformally

product form in a large radial coordinate region,

where ds2

s 7 is the sp(2)  sp(1)-invariant metric on s7:

s 7 = d2 +

ds2  dr2 +

r2ds2

s 7,

(i  ai)2.

(6.1)

(6.2)

now the equation (4.7) may be regarded as the gradient ow of the chern-simons theory
on s7 as follows. let us dene the action by

cs[a] =z s 7

  tr (a  da +

2
3

a  a  a),

(6.3)

where a stands for spin(7) connection and  a closed four-form on s7 induced by the
calibration four-form on the total space with spin(7) holonomy. it is explicitly written

as

 = 1  2  3  8  1  2  3  8 + 2  1  3  8  3  1  2  8

+ 1  2  1  2 + 2  3  2  3 + 1  3  1  3,

(6.4)

16

using the orthonormal frame of the metric (6.2)

i =

1
2

sin   i,

i =

1
5

(i  ai),

8 = d.

the gradient ow of the functional (6.3) obeys a dierential equation

d
dt

a =   (   f ),

(6.5)

(6.6)

which reproduces the ow (4.7) if we use the ansatz (3.1)-(3.4) and (4.1)- (4.3) with
f = 1. the critical points of cs[a], i.e., the solutions of  f = 0, then reduce to those
of the potential function u, which does not mean at-connections as in the 3-dimensional

chern-simons theory.

the energy-momentum tensor of the yang-mills eld is

t y m
 = tr(ff 

 ) 

1
4

gtr(ff ) .

(6.7)

for the octonionic instantons the energy-momentum tensor t does not vanish in general
and this presents a sharp contrast with the case of four dimensional instantons. we can
prove that (anti) self-duality of the curvature implies t y m = 0 using a property of the

totally antisymmetric tensor  in four dimensions. hence a four dimensional instanton
does not disturb the ricci atness of the background metric. however the octonionic self-

duality is not sucient for leading a vanishing energy-momentum tensor and this causes

an issue of the back reaction of matter to gravity. non-vanishing total energy-momentum

tensor is inconsistent with the ricci atness of the space-time. actually a similar issue

is encountered, if we embed a four dimensional instanton in higher dimensions. (note

that this gives a special case of higher dimensional instanton.) in such a case, though the

tangent components of t along the four dimensional submanifold on which the instanton
lives vanish as we argued above, the instanton produces a non-vanishing contribution to
the (d  4) dimensional normal components of the energy-momentum tensor. one of
the ways to resolve this problem is to embed the solution to a consistent background of

superstrings. based on a four dimensional instanton, one can construct several ve brane

solutions which has a dilaton  and an anti-symmetric tensor eld h = db in addition to

the yang-mills eld a [18]. in these solutions we can think of four dimensional instanton

as a source of conguration in the transverse space. due to a coupling

dh = tr(r  r  f  f )

17

(6.8)

there are contributions from  and b which balances the total energy-momentum tensor.

this should be so, since this provides a consistent background for superstrings. from

this example we believe our solutions should be promoted to a consistent background of

supermembrane or eleven dimensional super gravity [19][20][10].

appendix a. quaternionic kahler manifold

the holonomy group of a connected and orientable 4n dimensional riemannian manifold
is a subgroup of so(4n). if the holonomy group is reduced to sp(n)  sp(1) = sp(n) 
(caution: a quaternionic
sp(1)/z2, the manifold is called quaternionic kahler [14].
kahler manifold is not necessarily kahler !) the quaternionic kahler manifold is known

as a target space geometry of n = 2 supergravity in four dimensions. (if we consider

n = 2 global susy, then sp(1) part is trivial and the manifold is hyperkahler.) it also

provides a natural arena for a higher dimensional generalization of instanton equation.
note that when n = 1 the holonomy of quaternionic kahler manifold is sp(1) sp(1)/z2
and hence any four dimensional orientable manifold is quaternionic kahler. this may

be compared with the fact any two dimensional orientable manifold is kahler due to
so(2) = u(1).

on the frame bundle of a quaternionic kahler manifold the gauge transformation
among local coordinate patches is in sp(n)  sp(1). we can dene a quaternionic line
bundle as an associated bundle to the frame bundle as follows; each bre of quaternionic
line bundle is the space of quaternions h that is r4 as a vector space. on quaternions
there is a natural action of sp(1) = su(2). thus we can dene the gauge transformation
of the bre using the sp(1) part of the holonomy group. that is sp(n) part acts trivially

on the quaternionic line bundle. this especially implies that quaternionic line bundle on

hyperkahler manifold is trivial. it might be helpful to note that this construction is a

quaternionic analogue of complex line bundle (or the canonical u(1) bundle) on a kahler

manifold that has u(n) holonomy.

if we take a four dimensional spin manifold m, each factor of sp(1) is identied as
spin(3) that denes the spinor bundle s(m). hence, the complexied spinor bundle on

four dimensional manifold is regarded as a quaternionic line bundle. it is known that the

total space of spinor bundle on a four dimensional manifold possesses a natural spin(7)

structure.

appendix b. standard embedding of spin(7) con-

nection

we show that the octonionic self-duality of the spin connection  with respect to the

19

(local frame) lie algebra indices implies the octonionic self-duality of the curvature r =
d +    with respect to the space time form indices. let ab = ba be the spin
connection one-form. in eight dimensions  is so(8) valued in general. (we take the

euclidean signature in the following.) but if we impose the octonionic self-duality

the spin connection  can be regarded as spin(7) valued. the totally anti-symmetric

ab =

1
2

abcdcd ,

(b.1)

tensor abcd is related to the structure constants cabc of the octonion algebra as follows
[21];

abc8 = cabc , abcd =

abcdpqrcpqr ,

(b.2)

1
3!

where the duality is taken in seven dimensions. in terms of a local frame (vielbein) ea


we can dene a space-time self-dual four form

 =

1
4!

abcdea  eb  ec  ed .

on an eight dimensional manifold of spin(7) holonomy, the four form  is closed;

d = 0 ,

(b.3)

(b.4)

a crutial point is the following identity which follows from the property of the octonionic

structure constants cabc [21][11],

abcdf ghd = (f

a g
b g
a)h
(cid:16)(f g
c + f g
ab h

c + ((f gh) : cyclic)
bc h

a + f g

ca h

b ) + ((f gh) : cyclic)(cid:17) .

(b.5)

due to the symmetry of the riemann curvature tensor the self-duality of form indices

follows form that of lie algebra indices. thus it is enough to show that

where we have suppressed the two form indices. in the dening relation

rab =

1
2

abcdrcd ,

rab = dab + ac  cb

(b.6)

(b.7)

the self-duality of the second term is non-trivial. using the identity (b.5), we can show

the second term is indeed self dual. thus the curvature two form constructed from a

spin(7) valued spin connction  satises the octonionic instanton equation.
