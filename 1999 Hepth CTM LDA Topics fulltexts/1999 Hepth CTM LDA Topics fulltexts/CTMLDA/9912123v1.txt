we nd further evidence for the conjecture relating large n chern-simons theory on
s3 with topological string on the resolved conifold geometry by showing that the wilson
loop observable of a simple knot on s3 (for any representation) agrees to all orders in n

with the corresponding quantity on the topological string side. for a general knot, we nd

a reformulation of the knot invariant in terms of new integral invariants, which capture the

spectrum (and spin) of m2 branes ending on m5 branes embedded in the resolved conifold

geometry. we also nd an intriguing link between knot invariants and superpotential terms

generated by worldsheet instantons in n = 1 supersymmetric theories in 4 dimensions.

1. introduction

large n gauge theories have been conjectured by t hooft to be related to string

theories. a particularly simple example of gauge theories is the chern-simons theory,

solved by witten.

it is thus natural to ask about the large n limit of chern-simons

theory and look for an appropriate stringy description. some aspects of large n limit of

chern-simons theory were studied some time ago in [1], [2].

it was conjectured recently [3] that at least for some manifolds (including s3) the large

n limit does give rise to a topological string theory on a particular calabi-yau background.

this conjecture was checked at the level of the partition function on both sides; the chern-

simons answer was already well known, and the topological string partition function was

recently computed in two dierent ways (one by mathematicians, and one by using physical

reasoning about the structure of bps states).

it is natural to extend the conjecture to the observables of chern-simons theory,

which are wilson loop operators. namely we should consider product of wilson loop

observables for any choice of representation on each knot. we show how this question

can be formulated in the present context and explicitly check the map for the case of
the simple circle in s3 (unknot). the computation on the chern-simons side is well

known. on the topological string side, we end up with topological string amplitudes on

riemann surfaces with boundaries. mathematically these have not been studied, however

by connecting the partition function of topological strings to target space quantities we

compute them in terms of spectrum of m2 branes ending on m5 branes embedded in the

calabi-yau threefold. the target space interpretation is also related to generation of n = 1

superpotential terms in four dimensions (which we relate it analogously to the spectrum

of domain walls).

for a general knot nding the explicit form of the m5 brane embedded in the calabi-

yau is not trivial, though physically we argue it should be possible.

in this way we

reformulate knot invariants in terms of new invariants capturing the spectrum of m2 branes

ending on m5 branes.

the organization of this paper is as follows:

in section 2 we review the large n

conjecture for chern-simons theory. in section 3 we show how the wilson loop observable

for arbitrary knot and representation can be formulated in this set up, and apply the gauge

theory/geometry correspondence for the case of the simple knot. in section 4 we show how

the results anticipated from the wilson loop observables can be directly obtained using

1

the spectrum of m2 branes ending on m5 branes (or d2 branes ending on d4 branes). we

also point out connections with generation of superpotential terms with theories with 4

supercharges. in section 5 we present some concluding remarks and suggestions for future

work.

2. the large n conjecture for chern-simons theory

in this section we review the conjecture of [3] which relates large n limit of su (n )
chern-simons gauge theory on s3 to a particular topological string amplitude. the mo-

tivation for the conjecture was that, in the context of topological strings of the a-type

on calabi-yau threefolds, there are d-branes with three-dimensional worldvolume which

support the chern-simons gauge theory [4]. so it is natural to expect that at least in some

cases, by putting many branes on some cycles and taking the large n limit, we end up

with a topological string on some deformed calabi-yau, but without branes. this is what

was found to be the case in [3], which we will now review.

2.1. the statement of the conjecture

the conjecture in [3] states that the chern-simons gauge theory on s3 with gauge

group su (n ) and level k is equivalent to the closed topological string theory of a-type on
the s2 blown up conifold geometry with

 =

2

k + n

,

t =

2in
k + n

,

(2.1)

where  is the string coupling constant and t is the kahler modulus of the blown-up s2.

the coupling constant gcs of the chern-simons theory, after taking into account the nite
renormalization, is related to  as  = g2
i times the t hooft coupling g2

cs. therefore the kahler moduli t given by (2.1) is
csn of the chern-simons theory. the geometric motivation
of the conjecture is based on starting with the topological strings on conifold geometry
t s3 and putting many branes on s3, for which we get a large n limit of chern-simons
on s3 supported on the brane. the conjecture states that in the large n limit the branes
disappear but lead instead to the resolution of the conifold geometry where an s2 has

blown up.

2

the conjecture has been checked as follows: start with the vacuum amplitude z(s3)

of the chern-simons gauge theory on s3 (with the normalization z(s2  s1) = 1);

z(s3) =

the large-n expansion of log z(s3) is given by

(2.7)

(2.8)

it turns out that the expressions (2.4) and (2.8) for fg are exactly those of the g-loop topo-

logical string amplitude on the resolved conifold. the constant map from the worldsheet

3

to the target space gives rise to the term i
c3
g1
in fg with g  2 [9]. regarding worldsheet instantons, since the only non-trivial 2-cycle
in the target space is the blown-up s2, their contributions are from multi-coverings of the
riemann surface onto the s2. for g = 0, 1 and 2, the expressions in the instanton terms

24 t in f1 [8], and rmg

12 t3 in f0 [6]2, and 1

in (2.4) and (2.5) agree with the results of [6], [8], and [9] respectively. more recently,

the contribution of of the worldsheet instantons are evaluated for all g in [5], in complete

agreement with (2.8). these expressions can also be derived, as was done in [10], from

the target space view point by identifying what the topological strings compute in type

iia compactication on the corresponding calabi-yau threefold. it turned out that the

full structure of fg is encoded in terms of the spectrum of wrapped d2 branes on the
calabi-yau. this will be reviewed later in this paper.

in this paper, we provide further evidence for the conjecture. we will show that the

wilson loop expectation value of the chern-simons theory also has a natural interpretation

in terms of the topological string on the resolved conifold geometry.

2.2. conifold transition

as noted above, the geometric insight that led to the conjecture is the fact that one

can view the chern-simons theory as the open topological string theory. consider the
cotangent space t s3 of s3 as the target space of the topological string. it was shown in
[4] that, if we wrap n d-brane on the base s3 of the cotangent space, the open topological

string theory on the d-brane is equivalent to the chern-simons theory with the gauge

group su (n ). the cotangent space has the canonical symplectic form

 =

3

xi=1

dqi  dpi,

(q  s3, p  tqs3),

(2.9)

and the base s3 is a lagrangian submanifold. therefore the open string on the d-brane

allows the topological twist of the a-type.

at this point, it would be useful to review basic facts about the conifold transition.

the space t s3 can also be regarded as a deformed conifold geometry,

y2
 = a2,

(y  c4)

(2.10)

4

x=1

2 the coecients of 1 and t in f0 have analogous interpretations [7], and they also agree with

the chern-simons prediction [3].

4

where, without loss of generality, we assume the deformation parameter a to be real. to
see that (2.10) is indeed t s3, we can set y = x + ip and rewrite the equation as

(x)2  (p)2 = a2,

xp = 0.

(2.11)

the rst equation suggests that the base s3 of radius a is located at p = 0 and the second
equation shows that p are coordinates on the cotangent space at x  s3. as a  0, the
s3 shrinks to a point and a singularity appears. it is known as the conifold singularity.

in addition to the deformation by a, the conifold singularity

y2
 = 0

x

(2.12)

can be smoothened out by the blow-up. it is described as follows. by introducing two pair

of complex coordinates (u, u) and (v, v) by

u = y1 + iy2,

u = y3  iy4

v = y3 + iy4,

v = y1  iy2,

the equation (2.12) can be written as

this means that there is some z such that

uv + vu = 0.

u = z u,

v = zv.

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

if we view z as a complex coordinate on s2 (as we should since u can be 0 and we need
to add z = ), one can interpret (2.15) as dening the bundle o(1) + o(1) over s2

where u and v are coordinates on the bers. with respect to the original symplectic form
(2.9), the volume of s2 is zero, which is another way to see that the conifold geometry is
singular. we can remove the singularity by blowing up the s2; this process is called the

small resolution (as opposed to the deformation of complex structure a in the previous

paragraph). see figure 1. the conifold singularity (2.14) can be either deformed to the
total space of t s3 or resolved to the total space of o(1)+o(1) over s2. the transition
from one to the other is called the conifold transition.

the conjecture in [3] states that the open topological string theory on the n d-branes
on s3 of the deformed conifold is equivalent to the closed topological string theory (without

d-branes) on the resolved conifold with t = 2in/(k + n ).

the deformed conifold is equivalent to the closed topological string theory on the resolved conifold

geometry.

3. wilson loop

3.1. denition

the basic observables of the chern-simons gauge theory are the wilson loops. for
each loop q(s)  s3 (0  s < 2), we can dene a generating function of wilson loops of

various representations of su (n ) in the following way. as shown in [4], the chern-simons
theory is the open topological string theory on n d-branes wrapping the base s3 of t s3.

we can probe the dynamics on these d-branes by introducing another set of d-branes.
first we dene a lagrangian 3-cycle associated to the knot q(s)  s3 as follows 3. at each
q s3 orthogonal to dq/ds.

point q(s) on the loop, we consider 2-dimensional subspace of t 

by going around the loop, we can dene the 3-cycle,

c = { (q(s), p) | pi

dqi
ds

= 0, 0  s < 2 }.

(3.1)

3 we thank c. taubes for discussion on these lagrangian cycles.

6

the topology of c is r2  s1. the symplectic form  vanishes on c, so it is a lagrangian
submanifold4. the 3-cycle intersects with the base s3 along the loop q(s). see figure 2.

p

s3

q(s)

figure 2: for each loop q(s)  s3, one can dene a unique lagrangian 3-cycle which extends in

the cotangent direction and intersects s3 on the loop q(s).

now let us wrap m d-branes on c. we then have the su (m ) chern-simons theory
on c as well as the su (n ) chern-simons theory on s3. in addition, we also have a new
sector of open string with one end on c and the other on s3. one can easily quantize the
topological string in this sector and obtain a complex scalar eld living on the intersection,

namely the loop q(s), which transforms according to the bi-fundamental of su (n ) 

su (m ). to see that there is one complex scalar eld of this type, we note that, in the

relevant open string sector i.e. the ramond sector, there are two states one with n = 2

u (1) charge 1/2 (a scalar) and the other with +1/2 (a 1-form). the physical states of

the topological string come from the sector with u (1) charge 1/2, and that turns out to

correspond to the scalar living on the loop q(s). the action for the scalar eld is gaussian,

and integrating it out gives the determinant,

z = exp(cid:20) log det(cid:18) d

ds

+ (ai  ai)

dqi

ds(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(3.2)

where a and a are the chern-simons gauge elds on s3 and c respectively. we can
evaluate the determinant by diagonalizing a and a (this is allowed since we are dealing
with the one-dimensional problem along the intersection). by using the formula

log det(cid:20) d

ds

+ i(cid:21) =



xn=

log(n + ) = log sin() + const,

(3.3)

4 the cycle c dened here is lagrangian but is not necessarily special lagrangian. in order

for to make the topological a-twist, it is sucient that  vanishes on c.

we nd

z(u, v ) = exphtr log(cid:16)u 1/2  v 1/2  u 1/2  v 1/2(cid:17)i

where u and v are path-ordered exponentials of the gauge elds along the loop,

u = p expi a  su (n ), v = p expi a  su (m ),

and we used det u = det v = 1.

we are interested in taking n to innity for a xed m . we view the m branes on c as

a probe. in this context, integrating out the gauge elds a will leave us with an eective

theory on the probe brane, which is an su (m ) chern-simons on c plus some corrections.

let us dene

(3.5)

which can be viewed as the generating functional for all the observables of the chern-
simons gauge theory on s3 associated to the unknot. then we obtain an eective theory

on the c brane, which is the deformation of the chern-simons theory as

s = scs( a; c) + f (t, v ).

(3.6)

here scs( a; c) deonotes the chern-simons action on c.

3.2. evaluation

let us evaluate hz(u, v )is3 explicitly when the loop q(s) is the unknot, i.e. a simple

circle in s3 which represents a trivial knot.

in this case it is known [11] that, for an

admissible representation rj of su (n ), the wilson loop expectation value is

htrrj u is3 =

s0j
s00

,

8

(3.7)

where sij is the modular transformation matrix for the characters of the su (n ) current
algebra at level k. if we know htrrj u i for all the representations, we can compute any
product of traces of u n in the fundamental representation by using the frobenius relation,

tru n1    tru nh =xy

(y ; , n1, . . . , nh)trr(y )u,

(3.8)

where y is the young tableau with n = n1 +    + nh boxes, r(y ) is the corresponding
representation of su (n ), and (y ; n1,    , nh) is the character of the representation of the
permutation group sn corresponding to y , evaluated for the permutation with cycles of
sizes n1,    , nh (for example, see [12]). to actually evaluate htru n1    tru nhis3, we use
the following trick. we rst note that s0j is given by

s0j = xww

(w) exp(cid:20)

2i
k + n

(w(), j + )(cid:21) ,

(3.9)

where w is the nite weyl group of su (n ), (w) = 1 is the parity of the element w  w,
j is the weight vector for the representation j, and  is a half of the sum of positive roots.
therefore s0j/s00 takes the form of the character of the nite dimensional group su (n ),
namely

htrrj u is3 = trrj u0,

(3.10)

where u0 is a xed element of su (n ) which, in the fundamental representation, takes the
form

3.3. conifold transition of the wilson loop

in the case of the unknot, it is straightforward to identify the eect of the conifold
transition on the lagrangian submanifold c. let us start with t s3 expressed as (2.10),

and consider the following anti-holomorphic involution on it.

y1,2 = y1,2, y3,4 = y3,4.

(3.15)

since the symplectic form  changes its sign under the involution, its xed point set
is automatically a lagrangian submanifold of t s3. this will be our c.
y = x + ip, the invariant locus of the action (3.15) is

if we write

p1,2 = 0, x3,4 = 0

and the equation (2.10) becomes

(x1)2 + (x2)2 = a2 + (p3)2 + (p4)2.

(3.16)

(3.17)

therefore c intersects with s3 along the equator of s3, i.e. the loop q(s) is the unknot.

the loop q(s) in this case is identied with

q(s) :

(x1)2 + (x2)2 = a2,

x3 = x4 = 0.

to dene c after the conifold transition, we continue to identify it with the invariant

locus of the anti-holomorphic involution. to describe this explicitly let us use the coor-
dinates (u, v, z) or (u, v, z1) dened by (2.13) and (2.15). in these coordinates, the z2
invariant set c is characterized by

u = v, v = u,

and the conifold equation (2.14) restricted on c becomes

uu = vv.

the complex coordinate on the base s2 dened by (2.15) is

z = 

u
v

.

10

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

because of (3.19), z is pure phase. therefore one may view that c is a line bundle over the
equator |z| = 1 of s2 (the ber being the subspace of o(1)+o(1) given by v = zu). in
particular, c intersects with the base s2 along |z| = 1. see figure 3. since the intersection
is one-dimensional, c remains a lagrangian submanifold even after the s2 is blown up and

the symplectic form  is modied.

v = - z u

v

| z | = 1

s2

figure 3: after the conifold transition, the lagrangian 3-cycle touches the base s2 along the

equator |z| = 1 and extends in the ber directions following the constraint v = zv. the

worldsheet instanton can either wrap the northern hemisphere, as shown in the gure, ending on

the equator, or wrap the southern hemisphere.

according to the conjecture of [3], topological string with n d-branes wrapping on
the base s3 of t s3 is equivalent to topological string on the resolved conifold without

d-branes. here we are adding m d-branes on c on one side, and have traced it over to the
other side. on the t s3 side, the eective theory on the m probe branes was the chern-

simons action plus some corrections (3.6). so the conjecture gives the falsiable prediction

that, after the conifold transition, we should also see the eective theory on the brane to be

a deformed version of the chern-simons theory (3.6). indeed it has been shown in [4] that

when there are holomorphic maps from riemann surfaces with boundaries to the target

space, with boundaries lying on the d-brane, the chern-simons action gets deformed. in
the original geometry of t s3, there are no such maps. however we got the deformation
by integrating the gauge theory on s3 and the scalar eld living on the knot. at large n ,

we have made a transition to a new geometry without any other sectors. but now, there
are non-trivial holomorphic maps that can end on c! since c intersects with the base s2

11

of the resolved conifold along |z| = 1, there are holomorphic maps from riemann surface

with a boundary with the image having the topology of disc. it is shown in [4] that the

eective theory on c should now be of the form as predicted in (3.6) with f (t, v ) given by

f (t, v ) =







xg=0

xh=1

xn1,,nh

2g2+hfg;n1,,nh(t)trv n1    trv nh .

(3.21)

here fg;n1,,nh is the topological string amplitude on a genus-g surface with h boundaries.
the factors trv ni are picked up by the boundary of the worldsheet, which wraps |ni|-times
the equator of the s2 either clockwise ni > 0 or counterclockwise ni < 0 depending on

whether the worldsheet is mapped to the upper or the lower hemisphere.

to see that the chern-simons computation (3.14) agrees with this expectation, we

note that, in the topological string computation, amplitudes are assumed to be analytic in

t. by performing the analytic continuation5, we can rewrite hz(u, v )i as

hz(u, v )is3 = exp"i



xn=1

trv n + trv n
2n sin (n/2)

ent/2# .

(3.22)

this agrees with the general form (3.21) expected for the topological string amplitude. we

could make a more quantitative comparison by counting holomorphic maps. there are only

two basic holomorphic maps (with the image being a disc) with boundaries on c, which

are the upper and the lower hemispheres of the s2, together with their multicoverings, and

with the higher genus coverings of them (see figure 3). in particular, the comparison of

(3.21) and (3.22) suggests that all the relevant instantons have one boundary ending on c,

wrapping the equator of s2 either clockwise or counterclockwise. it would be interesting

to verify the prediction of the chern-simons computation (3.22) explicitly using the world-

sheet instanton calculus extending the results from the closed string case to open strings.

in this paper, we will take an alternative route, by giving the target space interpretation of

f (t, v ) and evaluate it explicitly by the schwinger-type computation, similar to what was

done in the closed string case in [10]. we will nd that the prediction (3.22) is precisely

reproduced in this way.

4. target space interpretation

topological strings are useful in computing superpotential-type terms in the context

of superstring compactication on calabi-yau manifold. in particular it is known [13] that

topological closed strings amplitude fg(ti) at genus g, where ti are the kahler moduli of
a calabi-yau threefold, computes the low energy eective theory terms of the type iia

compactication,

z d4xd4fg(ti)(cid:0)w 2(cid:1)g

,

(4.1)

where the integral is on the 4d n = 2 superspace, ti denote a vector multiplet with the
kahler expectation values as the top element. w denote the graviphoton multiplet (with
self-dual graviphoton eld strength as the top component), ,  denote symmetric spinor

indices and

w 2 = ww  

 

.

in fact it was through this connection where fg(ti) were reinterpreted in [10] in terms
of spectrum of wrapped m2/d2 branes in the calabi-yau threefold. in particular it was

shown that

fg(ti)2g2 =

of d0 branes, i.e. every m2 bound state can have arbitrary momentum around the circle.

in other words the sum over arbitrary number of d0 branes gives rise to a delta function,

which eectively replaces the schwinger time integral by a discrete sum represented by n
above. the factor of (2 sin(n/2))2s2 arises from a (2 sin(n/2))2s having to do with the

2 )(cid:3)s

we would like to repeat an analogous scenario for reinterpretation of topological a-

model with d-branes which include a supersymmetric 3-cycle in the internal calabi-yau

threefold as its worldvolume. there are various cases one can consider. we will consider in

particular the type iia compactication on a calabi-yau, with one additional d4 brane

13

wrapped around a supersymmetric 3-cycle s and lling an r2  r4 in the uncompactied
spacetime. suppose the rst betti number of s is r = b1(s). then on r2 subspace of r4
live r (2,2) supersymmetric chiral superelds i corresponding to the scalar moduli of s

in the calabi-yau threefold [15]. the top component of this chiral eld is a complex eld

whose phase is related to the expectation value of the wilson line of the gauge eld a on
the d4-brane around the corresponding 1-cycle of s. moreover i can be viewed as a (2, 2)
vector multiplet on r2. the u (1) gauge eld on r2 corresponds to the magnetic 2-form b

eld on the d4 brane db = da and taking the component of b along the corresponding
cycle in s, to yield a gauge eld on r2. one could generalize this by considering m copies

of the d4 brane. we will get in this case m copies of the u (1) gauge eld and so the
elds 
i will be naturally in the adjoint of u (1)m . the permutation groups sm which
is the symmetry of d4 branes acts on this set of elds to permute the i. giving vev
to h
i allows us to think of each i-direction a diagonal u (m ) matrix of holonomy
given by diagonal elements exp(i

i ). let us denote this u (m ) matrix by vi.

i i = 

now we are ready to state what physical amplitude the topological string computes

in the presence of d-branes. the topological strings in this case computes

(w  v)h1 ,

(4.2)

where w  v = wv 
, and v denotes the vector orthogonal to the noncompact
worldvolume of d4 brane, and  are the usual gamma matrices. the delta function

above localizes the contribution to the superspace dened by the noncompact part of the

d4 brane. here

and fg,ni
 = 1,    , h and where on each hole  the circle on the riemann surface is mapped to the
boundary of s characterized by the h1(s) class ni
. the trace factors above are just the
usual chan-paton factors. the derivation of (4.2) is similar to that for the closed string

case and can be done most conveniently in the berkovits formalism [16], similar to what

was done in the closed string case for the calabi-yau topological amplitudes in [17].

as in the closed string case, we would like to connect (4.2) with contributions due

to wrapped d2 branes. the main additional ingredient in this case is that the d2 brane
can end on the d4 brane s. this will give a state magnetically charged under the u (1)m

14

living on the d4 brane. one term included in (4.2) after doing the superspace integral is a
term of the form rf 2g2+h where f denotes the expectation value of the 4d graviphoton

eld strength restricted to the uncompactied worldvolume of the d4 brane. if we give a

vev to the graviphoton, hf i = , this would compute correction to r r as a function of

f (t, vi) =xg,h

fg,h(t, vi)2g2+h.

this is the summed up version of the topological string amplitudes over all genera and

holes, where the role of the string coupling constant  is played by the vev of f .

we thus compute the contribution of magnetically charged d4 branes ending on s

to r r in the presence of the background f . each such particle will transform according

to some representation r for iui(1)m /sm , where i runs from i = 1,    , b1(s). we in
principle do not know if they form representation of u (m ) (for each element of b1(s))6,
but nevertheless we can assign them to representatitions of u (m ) if we allow negative
multiplicity. this is because any sm symmetric spectrum for u (1)m can be written as
combination of weights appearing in various representations of u (m ). from this point

on, we will therefore take r to be a representation of u (m ) (for each b1(s)) and allow
negative multiplicities. in addition every such state is characterized by its bulk d2 brane

charge q  h2(m, s), i.e. a 2-cycle in the calabi-yau threefold ending on s. every
such eld will be represented by some spin j eld in 2 dimensions. to determine j, it is
most convenient to view it from the m-theory perspective7; in the strong coupling limit

this geometry gets related to m-theory on the calabi-yau threefold, with m5 brane lling
s  r3. the magnetic charged state correspond to particles in 3 dimensions with m 2

branes ending on the m5 brane. the little group of massive particles in three dimensions

is so(2) and so the particle carries a 3d spin j. upon reduction to 2d, this particle is

realized by a eld with spin j. moreover each such particle can be bound to an arbitrary

number of d0 branes. this is clear also from the m-theory perspective as each particle

carries an arbitrary momentum as we go down from 3 dimensions to 2 on a circle. the

computation then is as in the closed string case, where we eectively get the schwinger

6 there is a priori no reason why m coincident branes give rise to a magnetic u (m ) gauge

theory.

7 similar to the closed string case, if we have an isolated riemann m2 brane with h holes and
by quantizing the zero modes on

g handles this gives a state of spin content (cid:2)2(0) + ( 1

4.1. applications to n = 1, d = 4 systems

in the above to interpret the topological string amplitudes with boundaries, we used
a d4 brane system with worldvolume r2  s. instead we could have used a d6 brane
system with worldvolume r4  s. this would only make sense in the context of non-

compact calabi-yau manifolds (otherwise the ux of d6 brane charge has nowhere to go).

then again the elds vi correspond to chiral elds in d = 4. in this case the interpretation

of the topological amplitudes given in (4.2) gets modied. the simplest case to consider

turns out to be h = 1 and g arbitrary.

in this case the topological string amplitudes

compute

z d4xd42()fg,1(vi, t)(cid:0)w 2(cid:1)g

,

(4.6)

and in particular f0,1, i.e. topological disc amplitudes computes superpotential terms for

n=1 theories in four dimensions. this has already been noted in [19] and is being further

studied in [20]. let us call f0,1 = w (vi, t), the superpotential. from the formula (4.5) we

thus have a general expression for the superpotential w in terms of the spectrum of bps

states namely

w (t, vi) =



xn=1 xvr,q

nr,q,0

n2 en(tq+iv).

(4.7)

8 as before we are dropping terms polynomial in t and s which would have corresponded to

n = 0 in the above sum.

17

a special simple case of this is when we have a single brane where vi can be viewed
as a complex supereld eii . given that our derivation of this term seems to require
2-dimensional concepts, it is natural to ask if we could also reproduce this from a 4-

dimensional viewpoint. as we will see this is also possible. in the case of d6 branes with
worldvolume r4  s, the magnetically charge branes are d4 branes ending on the d6
brane. this will correspond to a domain wall in r4. the expression (4.7) then suggests
that we should be able to relate the superpotential term, to the structure of domain walls

by integrating them out. however unlike the 2-dimensional case, we cannot send the

domain walls around the loop, so the question is how would we obtain such an expression

by integrating elds out in the 4d case.

a hint comes from the recent work [21] and a similar case studied in [22], where it

was shown how extra elds are relevant for reproducing the domain wall structure. for

each domain wall, we introduce a eld y as a chiral supereld, which characterizes it by
shifting by 2i as we go across the domain wall. since we can have a priori an arbitrary

number of domain walls, we must thus have innitely many vacua, given by shifting the

expectation value of y by 2in. moreover the tension for the domain wall should be given
by the bps formula,

w (y + 2i)  w (y ) = 2iz.

(4.8)

the superpotential satisfying these constraints which was found in [21] in a similar context

is given by

note that the critical points obeying dy w = 0 are given by

w = zy + exp(y).

exp(y) = z,

namely y = logz + 2in, and that the equation (4.8) is satised. if we integrate out
the hidden variable y we obtain by replacing y by its critical value a superpotential
term

w = z(1  logz).

(4.9)

in the case at hand for each element v in a representation v  r of the magnetic charges,

and charge q in the bulk we have nr,q,0 net bps domain walls for each integer m, with
bps tension

z = tq + iv   + 2im.

plugging this into (4.9) and summing over all such states, we obtain the formula (4.7).

18

4.2. application to d-brane on o(1) + o(1) over s2

in this section we will show how the results of the previous section are in agreement

with the above analysis, and in particular gives an independent derivation for topological
a-model in o(1) + o(1) over s2 with the 3 cycle c we have discussed. in that case the

b1(c) = 1 and so we have only one chiral eld, which gives rise to one holonomy matrix
v . it is clear what the magnetically charges states are; they correspond to the d2 brane

wrapping the northern hemisphere and ending on s or the one wrapping the southern

hemisphere and ending on s. the rst one has (tq, r) given by (t/2, fundamental) and
the second has (t/2, anti-fundamental). they both have spin 0, as there is no moduli for

them. we thus obtain from (4.4):

f (t, v ) = i

trv n + trv n
2n sin(n/2)

ent/2,



xn=1

which agrees with the knot invariant predicted for the unknot, as discussed in the previous

section, with t = 2in/(k + n ) and  = 2/(k + n ).

5. suggestions for future work

here we have mainly concentrated in computing the expectation value of the wilson

loop for a simple knot, and have found a striking agreement with the predictions of topolog-

ical strings in the large n limit, anticipated from the large n chern-simons/topological

string duality proposed in [3]. this was done by independently computing both sides and

checking that they agree. on the topological string we used d-branes ending on branes to

get a prediction for what the topological string should reduce to.

it would be nice to generalize this for arbitrary knots. there are two obstacles to

overcome. on the chern-simons side we need to compute

hz(u, v )is3 =*exp" 
xn=1

tr

1
n

u ntrv n#+s3

.

this is already rather dicult to do, even though in principle it should be possible. the
reason for this is the appearance of all the powers of tru n. in particular we need to know
all correlations htru n1    tru nk i. for a general knot, the correlators do not decouple,

unlike the unknot (3.12). even though it is in principle possible to compute them, they

have not been computed in the full generality we need. nevertheless the structure of the

19

answer for the htru    tru i dictated by the skein relations [11] are compatible with the

general answer expected for the knot invariants, which follows from the discussion in the

previous section, in particular (4.4). note that we are mapping all the knot invariants

for arbitrary representations, into new integer invariants nq,r,s, where two dierent qs
dier by an integer (so they can be parametrized by an integer), s denotes a positive

(or zero) spin representation, and r is a representation of u (m ) for any m . we expect

that for each knot r will stabilize for large enough m . what we mean by this is that it

will given by representations with nite number of boxes in the young tableau (or whose

conjugate has nite number of boxes). thus for m large enough we have probed the full

content of r representation (for example for the unknot we found that already m = 1

is sucient and the structure for higher m s can be induced from that). this may be a

very useful reformulation of knot invariants, somewhat analogous to the reformulation of

gromov-witten invariants, in terms of the new invariants dened in [10]. in particular the
knot invariants would be given by9

hz(u, v )is3 = i





xn=1

xs=0xr xq

nr,q,s(2sin(n/2))s1exp(ntq)trr

v n
n

for understanding this new formulation of knot invariants, we also have to construct

a largrangian submanifold for an arbitrary knot, on the resolution of the conifold, gen-

eralizing our explicit construction for the unknot. that there should be such a canonical

lagrangian submanifold for each knot is natural. this is because we already have identied,
for an arbitrary knot, the lagrangian submanifold on the t s3 side, and small resolution

does not change the geometry of the lagrangian submanifold at innity. so with some

deformation near the origin we should be able to obtain the lagrangian submanifold after

the conifold singularity is blown up. then we are predicting that the topological string

amplitudes, whose answer must have the structure (4.4), compute the knot invariants.

this would be a very important subject to develop, not only for a deeper understanding of

knot invariants, but also for a better understanding of topological strings with boundaries.

9 in comparing with the knot invariants, it is natural to do analytic continutation, as we
have seen in the case of the unknot, in the case where the representation are tensor products of

the fundamental representation of u (m ) (as opposed to tensor products of the anti-fundamental

representation). this would be equivalent to replacing for those representations the corresponding

tq  tq, and changing the sign of the power of v and putting an overall sign in front of those

terms.

20

also we have seen in this paper how we can compute superpotential terms on the

type iia compactications on calabi-yau threefold in the presence of d6 brane, at least

in some simple cases. in a more general case, doing the computation on the mirror should

be simpler [23]. some examples of this have been recently studied in [20]. this may well

lead to a method for geometric engineering of n = 1 and its solution in terms of the type

iib mirror. namely, we start with the usual geometric engineering of n = 2, introduce

additional d6 branes to break the n = 2 to n = 1 (eectively giving mass terms to the

adjoint elds) and then using the type iib mirror to compute the superpotential terms

generated, very much the way prepotential for n = 2 theories were computed using mirror

symmetry. this would be very exciting to develop further.
