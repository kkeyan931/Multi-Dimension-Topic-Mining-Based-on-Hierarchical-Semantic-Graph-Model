gamow vectors in non-relativistic quantum mechanics are generalized eigenvectors (kets) of
self-adjoint hamiltonians with complex eigenvalues (er  i/2). like the dirac kets, they are
mathematically well dened in the rigged hilbert space   h  . gamow kets are derived from
the resonance poles of the s-matrix sj (z) at z = zr = er  i/2. they have a breit-wigner energy
distribution, an exponential decay law, and are members of a basis vector expansion whose truncation
gives the nite dimensional eective theories with a complex hamiltonian matrix. they also have an
asymmetric time evolution described by a semigroup generated by the hamiltonian, which expresses
a fundamental quantum mechanical arrow of time. these gamow kets are generalized to relativistic
gamow vectors by extrapolating from the galilei group to the poincare group. this leads to
semigroup representations of the poincare group which are characterized by spin j and complex
in these non-unitary representations (j, sr) the
lorentz subgroup is unitarily represented and the four-momenta are minimally complex in the
sense that the four-velocity p = p
is real. the relativistic gamow vectors have all the properties
sr
listed above for the non-relativistic gamow vectors and are therefore ideally suited to describe
relativistic resonances and quasistable particles with resonance mass mr and lifetime /.

i. introduction

following wigner [1], an elementary relativistic quantum system, an elementary particle with mass m and spin j
is in the mathematical theory described by the space of an unitary irreducible representation (uir) of the poincare
group p. from these uir, the relativistic quantum elds are constructed [2]. more complicated relativistic systems are
described by direct sums of uir (for towers of elementary particles) or by direct products of uir (for combination
of two or more elementary particles) [2]. a direct product of uir may be decomposed into a continuous direct sum
(integral) of irreducible representations [3,4]. the uir are characterized by three invariants (m2, j, sign(p0)), where j
represents the spin and the real number m represents the mass of elementary particle (we restrict ourselves here to
sign(p0) = +1).

the uir of the poincare group p describe stable elementary particles (stationary systems). there is only a very
small number of truly stable particles in nature and most relativistic (and also non-relativistic) quantum systems
are decaying states (weakly or electromagnetically), or hadron resonances with an exponential decay law and nite
lifetime r = 
 (in their rest frame) and a breit-wigner energy (at rest) distribution. the uir of p therefore describe
only a few of the relativistic quantum systems in nature; for the vast majority of elementary particles listed in the
particle physics booklet [5], the uir provide only a more or less approximate description. we want to present here
a special class of (non-unitary) semi-group representations of p which describe quasistable relativistic particles.
phenomenologically, one always takes the point of view that resonances are autonomous quantum physical entities,
and decaying particles are no less fundamental than stable particles. stable particles are not qualitatively dierent
from quasistable particles, but only quantitatively by a zero (or very small) value of . therefore both stable and
quasistable states should be described on the same footing. this has been accomplished in the non-relativistic case,
where a decaying state is described by a generalized eigenvector of the (self adjoint, semi-bounded) hamiltonian with
a complex eigenvalue zr = er  i/2 [6] called gamow vectors. the stable state vectors with real eigenvalues es
are the special case with  = 0, i.e., zr = er  i/2  es.
in the standard hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics, such vectors do not exist and one had to employ the
rigged hilbert space (rhs) formulation of quantum mechanics. diracs bras and kets are, mathematically, generalized
eigenvectors with real eigenvalues, and gamow vectors are generalizations of dirac kets. they are described by kets
g  |z
energy and width. like dirac kets, the gamow kets are functionals of a rigged hilbert space :

the conjugate operator h  of the hamiltonian h is uniquely dened by the rst equality in (2), as the extension of

are the same.

the non-relativistic gamow vectors have the following properties:

1. they have an asymmetric (i.e., t  0 only) time evolution and obey then an exponential law:
|er  i/2i = eiertet/2|er  i/2i, only for t  0.

g(t) = eiht

there is another gamow vector g = |er + i/2+i

to the basis of the whole galilei group is trivial.

for the two particle scattering states (direct product of two irreducible representations of the galilei group [7]) one
uses eigenvectors of angular momentum (jj3) for the relative motion and total momentum p for the center of mass
motion. thus

where e runs along the cut on the positive real axis of the 1-st sheet of the j-th partial s-matrix, are the scattering
states. the proper eigenvectors of (9) with e = |en| at the poles on the negative real axis on the 1-st sheet are the
bound states |enjj3i  . by the galilei transformation one can transform these vectors to arbitrary momentum p;
e and p are not intermingled by galilei transformations.
to obtain the non-relativistic gamow kets one analytically continues the dirac-lippmann-schwinger ket (6) into
i and obtains

the second sheet of the j-th partial s-matrix to the position of the resonance pole |zr = er  i/2, jj3
the following representation [6]:

|zr = er  i/2, jj3

however, complex momenta cannot be obtained in this way since the galilei transformations commute with the
intrinsic energy operator h.

in the relativistic case the lorentz transformation  in particular lorentz boosts  intermingle energy etot = p0 and
momenta pm, m = 1, 2, 3. thus complex energy or complex mass also leads to complex momenta. this has led in the
past to consider complicated complex momentum representations of the poincare group p. to restrict this unwieldy set
of poincare group representations we will consider a special class of minimally complex irreducible representations
of p to describe relativistic resonances and decaying elementary particles. our construction will also lead to complex
momenta p, but in our case the momenta will be minimally complex in such a way that the 4-velocities p  p
m
remain real. this construction was motivated by a remark of d. zwanziger [8] and is based on the fact that the
4-velocity eigenvectors |pj3(mj)i furnish as valid a basis for the representation space of p as the usual wigner basis
of momentum eigenvectors |pj3(m, j)i. this means every state of an uir (m, j), (    h(m, j)  , where 
denotes the space of well-behaved vectors and  the space of kets for the hilbert space h(m, j) of an uir), can be
written according to diracs basis vector decomposition as

 =xj3 z d3 p

here, |p, j3i   are the eigenkets of the 4-velocity operator p = pm 1 and j3 (p) = hj3 p|i represents the 4-
velocity distribution of the vector . the 4-velocity eigenvectors are often more useful for physical reasoning, because
4-velocities seem to fulll to rather good approximation velocity super-selection rules which the momenta do not [9].
the relativistic gamow vectors will therefore be dened, not as momentum eigenvectors, but as 4-velocity eigen-
vectors in the direct product space of uir spaces for the decay products of the resonances r. we want to obtain the
relativistic gamow vectors from the pole term of the relativistic s-matrix in complete analogy to the way the non-
relativistic gamow vectors were obtained [6]. in the absence of a vector space description of a resonance, we shall also
in the relativistic theory dene the unstable particle by the pole of the analytically continued partial s-matrix with
angular momentum j = jr at the value s = sr  (mr  i/2)2 of the invariant mass square variable (mandelstam
2
variable) s = (p1 + p2 + )2 = e2
r, where p1, p2,. . . are the momenta of the decay products of r [10]. this
means that the mass mr and lifetime /r or the complex invariant mass wr = (mr  i/2) = sr, in addition to
spin jr, are the intrinsic properties that dene a quasistable relativistic particle 2.

to obtain the clebsch-gordan coecients hp1p2[m1, m2]|pj3(wj)i in (15), one follows the same procedure as given

done in [12]. the result is

the interaction-incorporating observables

p0 = h, p m, j ,

(27)

i.e., the exact generators of the poincare group ( [2] sec. 3.3). these vectors |pj3(wj)i in (24), or |0j3(wj)i in
(25) when boosted by u(l(p)), which for the xed value [jw] span an irreducible representation space of the poincare
group with the exact generators, will be used for the denition of the relativistic gamow vectors.
the relativistic gamow kets are obtained by analytically continuing the dirac-lippmann-schwinger kets (25) or (24)
into the second (or higher) sheet of the jr-th partial wave s-matrix sjr(s) to the position of the resonance pole at
sr = (mr  i/2)2. this can be done for any value of p (and j3), e.g., for p = 0.

to prove (32) from (28), and also to obtain (28) from the pole term of the s-matrix one needs to use the properties of
the hardy class space +. the continuous linear combinations of the 4-velocity kets (28) with an arbitrary 4-velocity
distribution function j3 (p)  s (schwartz space),

g

jr sr = xj3 z d3 p

2p0|pj3(sr, jr)ijr (p),

also represents relativistic gamow states with the complex mass sr = (mr  i/2)2 and have the representation (28).
this then implies, much like in the rhs theory of non-relativistic gamow vectors, that the time translation of the
decaying state is represented by a semigroup, e.g., at rest,

eih|p = 0, j3(srjr)i = eimr e /2|p = 0, j3(srjr)i for   0 only

(33)

where  is time in the rest system.

thus relativistic gamow states are representations of p with spin jr and complex mass sr = (mr  i/2)2 =
m2
  im, for which the lorentz subgroup is unitarily represented. they are obtained from the resonance pole of
the relativistic partial s-matrix sjr (s), have an exponential time evolution at rest with lifetime / and have  due
to their association to the s-matrix pole and to the hardy class spaces  a breit-wigner energy distribution

(34)

these are all features which one may welcome or accept for states that are to describe relativistic resonances. in
addition, they have a semigroup time evolution expressing a fundamental quantum mechanical arrow of time.

[7] the projectively equivalent irreducible representations (m, e, s)  (m, 0, s)  [m, s] of the galilei group are characterized
by non-relativistic mass m and spin s. in the direct product of [m1, s1]  [m2, s2], the two spins are combined (using so(3)
clebsch-gordan coecients) to give the total spin s. then, using orbital angular momentum l for the relative orbital
motion, one couples s with l to form the total angular momentum j with the 3-component j3. this gives the basis vectors

[9] the use of the velocity eigenvectors has been suggested as early as 1965 by j. werle, on a symmetry scheme described
by non-lie algebra, ictp preprint, trieste, 1965, unpublished. it has been incorporated in the spectrum-generating group
approach for the mass and spin spectrum, a. bohm, phys. rev. 175, 1767 (1968). it has also been used to relate the form
factors for dierent decays to universal form factors for an su (3) multiplet in a. bohm, phys. rev. d 13, 2110 (1976), and
a. bohm and j. werle, nucl. phys. b 106,165 (1976). as dynamical stability group of p/m  the same idea has been
suggested by h. van dam and l.c. biedenharn, phys. rev. d 14, 405 (1976). velocity eigenstates were introduced around
1990 as states of heavy quark eective theory, again to reduce the number of independent form factors: a.f. falk,

study institute, eds. r. k. ellis et al. (world scientic, 1992) and references thereof. in this approach one often gets the
impression that the use of the velocity basis vectors leads to approximate results. this, however, is not the case if one takes
into consideration that velocity eigenkets do not represent physical states, but that physical state vectors are obtained
from the kets as continuous superpositions using the right measure in the integration. if this is done, the values of the
observable quantities do not depend upon whether one uses the velocity basis or the momentum basis, only that the use
of the velocity basis often provides a more practical means of computation, by leading to form factors that do not depend
upon the mass.
