introduction

in [1], it was shown how to sew tree vertices without ghosts using the group theoretic approach to
string theory [2] in order to obtain a new, composite vertex. we shall start with a short review of
how to do that. what we must do is sew two legs of two vertices, one leg from each vertex. what
we have in the beginning are two vertices v1 and v2 with n1 and n2 legs, respectively (gure 1).
we now sew leg e from v1 with the adjoint of leg f from v2. what we have now is the
substitution of the two sewn legs by a propagator (gure 2). when this propagator is written in
parametric form, it is an integration of one of the variables (in order to cancel one spurious degree
of freedom) and a conformal factor p which contains terms of lns acting on leg e only.

so the resulting vertex vc (called the composite vertex) has the generic form

where the hermitian conjugate of v2 is for the sewn leg f only and

vc = v1p v 
2 ,

p = z dx p

(1)

(2)

where x is a suitable variable. in what follows, we shall often write p instead of p , calling attention
to the integration when necessary.
when the two vertices are sewn together, we identify legs e and f . we also identify the
koba-nielsen variable ze with one of the koba-nielsen variables of vertex v 
2 , and the koba-
nielsen variable zf we identify with one of the koba-nielsen variables of vertex v1. in [1], this
identication is made in the following way: ze may be identied with zf 1 or zf +1, and zf may be
identied with ze1 or ze+1. so there are four possible combinations: a) ze = zf 1 , zf = ze1;
b) ze = zf +1 , zf = ze+1; c) ze = zf 1 , zf = ze+1; d) ze = zf +1 , zf = ze1.

2 oscillator case

the two original vertices satisfy some overlap identities and so shall do the composite vertex. one
particular overlap identity is given by considering the operator qi with conformal weight d = 0
dened by [2]



qi(i) = 

xn=

n6=0

1
n

n (i)n + i
i

0 ln i +



i

0

where i

n are bosonic oscillators with commutation relations

[i
[i

n , aj
0 , aj

m ] =  ijn,m , n, m 6= 0 ,
n ] = 0 , n .

the overlap identity is given by

v hqi(i)  qj(j)i .

.

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

because we are considering the adjoint of leg f in vertex v2, we must see what the adjoint of

these overlap identities are. first, by the denition of qi, we have that

qi(i) = qi(i) = qi(i) .

so, the adjoint of the overlap equations is given by

hqi(i)  qj(j)i v  = 0 .

we now take the overlap identity considering the eects of the operator qi(i) on the vertex

v1 on a generic leg i and on leg e1 (gure 3):

v1hqi(i)  qe(e)i = 0 .

(9)

we may then insert the unit operator 1 = pp 1 and multiply by p without altering the result:
(10)

v1pp 1hqi(i)  qe(e)i p .

since the conformal operator p acts only on leg e, it will have no eect on qi(i). in order to
compute the eect of p on qe(e), we must know that, for a conformal transformation v acting
on a conformal operator r(z) of weight d,

(7)

(8)

(11)

(12)

(13)

dz (cid:19)d
v r(z)v 1 = (cid:18) dv z

r(z) .

since qe(e) has conformal weight d = 0, we have

and (gure 4)

p 1qe(e)p = qe(cid:16)p 1e(cid:17) ,
v1phqii  qe(p 1e)i = 0 .

1as we shall be seeing soon, this form of the overlap will not lead to the correct composite vertex in the case

where the cycling transformations of the legs that are not sewn involve the sewn legs e or f .

2

the second term in the expression above is facing now leg f of vertex v 

2 , or best, its hermitean
conjugate. considering that the hermitean conjugate of qi (given by (7)), we then have the
following overlap identity between legs i and f :

v1phqi(i)  qf (p 1f )i = 0 .

we can then make a cycling transformation in order to obtain the correct factor for an arbitrary
leg j (j 6= f ) of vertex v 
v 1

2 . the only term that will be aected is the term depending on leg f :

(15)

j vf qf (cid:16)p 1e(cid:17) v 1

f vj = qj(cid:16)v 1

j vf p 1e(cid:17) .

doing this, the overlap identity for the composite vertex vc (gure 5) can be written as

vchqi(i)  qj(v 1

j vf p 1e)i = 0 ,

(16)

which is the overlap equation between two arbitrary legs i and j of the composite vertex vc.

but the overlap identity for the composite vertex, since none of legs i or j involves the propa-

gator, must be given by

(14)

(17)

vchqi(i)  qj(j)i = 0

and so in order for the equation we have obtained for the overlap of the composite vertex vc to be
true we must have

vf p 1v 1

e = 1  p 1 = 1v 1

f ve

which implies that the propagator is given by

p = v 1

e vf  .

(18)

(19)

in order to give an explicit expression for the propagator, we will now choose i to be of the

form

this choice is called the simple cycling [1] and it is the one that simplies our calculations the
most. in this choice, the propagator is given by

i = v 1

i

z = z  zi .

(20)

or in terms of the le

n operators2,

pz =

1
z

+ zf  ze ,

p = e(zf ze1)le

1(1)le

0 ele

1 ele

1 .

(21)

(22)

this form works for all choices for the composite vertex discussed before3. the true propagator is
given by expression (22) integrated over a suitable variable. choosing this variable to be s = zfze,
we then have

p =z 0



ds p =

1
le
1

(1)le

0 ele

1 ele

1

, s = zf  ze .

(23)

2other forms for this propagator are given by [1]:

p = ele
p = (1)le

0 le

1 /s(1)le

0 s2le
1 /ss2(le

0 ele
0 le

1/s

1 /s)e(le

1 le

1)/s .

3this armation is usually not valid for other choices of i.

3

before going any further, we must discuss another aspect of the theory that depends on the
particular way in which the legs are identied during the sewing procedure. let us consider the
more general case of an arbitrary cycling vi. this kind of cycling may depend on other coordinates
that are not zi. as an example, let us suppose that we are identifying coordinate ze of leg e with
coordinate zf 1 of vertex v 
2 and coordinate zf of leg f with coordinate zf 1 of vertex v1. the
overlap identity between legs i and e  1 on vertex v1 is

v1hqi(cid:16)v 1

0i z(cid:17)  q(e1)(cid:16)v 1

0(e1)z(cid:17)i

(24)

where we are calling v 1
the cycling transformation on leg j (j = 1, . . . , n ). these cycling
0j
transformations may depend on the other legs. as an example when this happens, we take another
choice of the cycling transformations i that is not as trivial as (20) but gives a simpler formula for
the propagator. this choice is given by [1] [3]

i = v 1

0i z =

(zi+1  zi1)
(zi+1  zi)



(z  zi)
(z  zi1)

(25)

which is the transformation that takes zi1, zi and zi+1 to , 0 and 1, respectively. its inverse is
given by

v0iz =

zi1(zi  zi+1)z + zi(zi+1  zi1)

(zi  zi+1)z + (zi+1  zi1)

.

(26)

in the case of the cycling given by (25), the cycling for leg e  1 will depend on leg e, which is
not present in the composite vertex. on this vertex, the overlap between leg e  1 and an arbitrary
leg j reads

this overlap equation involves terms that depend on leg e, which is non-existent in the composite
vertex vc. the correct overlaps should be given by

vchq(e1)(cid:16)v 1

0(e1)z(cid:17)  qj(cid:16)v 1

0j z(cid:17)i .

(27)

(28)

vchq(e1)(cid:16)v 1
e1 and v 1

j

e1z(cid:17)  qj(cid:16)v 1

j

z(cid:17)i ,

where the cycling transformations v 1
do not depend on legs e or f . so, in order to
restore the correct cycling transformation for the composite vertex, a conformal transformation
must be made on the cycling transformations on vertex v1. these are given by

where

v 1
0j  c1v 1

0j

,

j 6= e ,

c1 =

n1

yi=1

v 1
i v0i .

(29)

(30)

in this denition, we consider implicit that the transformation v 1
transformations on leg e will not be part of the composite vertex and so need not be modied.

e v0e = 1 since the conformal

considering the general case, we have that the overlap equation for v1 (gure 6) that will lead

to the correct composite vertex is now obtained from the original overlap

(31)

where 0i = v 1
7)

0i z and 0e = v 1

0e z. by inserting conformal transformation (30), we obtain (gure

inserting now the propagator, we obtain (gure 8)

v1c 1

1

hqi(i)  qe(e)i = 0 .

v1c 1

1 phqi(i)  qe(p 1e)i = 0

(32)

(33)

and we expect the composite vertex to have a dierent form (given shortly) than in (1) in order to
amount for the contributions of the conformal transformations. the second term of the overlap is
now facing leg f of vertex v 

2 so that we have the following overlap between legs i and f :

we are now facing the conformal transformation cf

4, dened by

v1c 1

1 phqi(i)  qf (p 1e)i = 0 .

cf = v 1

f v0f

(34)

(35)

which is necessary in order to change 0f  f . introducing this transformation we obtain (gure
9)

making a cycling transformation from leg f to leg j, we then obtain (gure 10)

v1c 1

1 pcf hqi(i)  qf (v 1

0f vf p 1e)i = 0 .

v1c 1

1 pcf v 

2 hqi(i)  qj(v 1

0j vf p 1e)i = 0 .

once again, a conformal transformation must be introduced because of the cycling transformations
v 1
0j . this is dened by

c2 =

n2

yi=1

i6=f

v 1
i v0i .

so that we now have (gure 11)

(42)

v1c 1

1 pcf v 

2 c 1

hqi(i)  qj(v 1

j vf p 1e)i = 0 .

the composite vertex must be dened in terms of the new cycling transformations and so it
must now include the conformal transformations that perform this change. so, it will now be
dened by

vc = v1c 1

1 pcf v 

2 c 1
2

.

considering this, the overlap identity for the composite vertex vc can be written as

since the correct overlap identity for the composite vertex is given by

vchqi(i)  qj(v 1

j vf p 1e)i = 0 .

4in this case, like we have seen for leg ve, vf may depend on the variable ze.

vchqi(i)  qj(j)i = 0

5

we must have

which implies once again that

vf p 1v 1

e = 1

p = v 1

e vf  .

for the cycling transformation (25), it is only necessary to do conformal transformations on legs
e  1, e, e + 1, f  1, f and f + 1, depending on the particular way the variables associated with
these legs are identied with the variables associated to legs e and f . in this particular example
(which is case a seen before), the conformal transformations are given by

it is now necessary to verify the eect of the gauge transformations c1 and c2 on the composite
vertex as given by formula (40). we shall do it by verifying the eect of c1 on vertex v1. in order
to do this we need the explicit expression for the bosonic oscillator vertex v1, given by [1] [4]

(56)

in order to calculate the eects of the conformal transformation c1 on these oscillators we must

make use of the following conformal operator [2]

p i(0i) =

using these transformation properties, the multiplication rules of matrices dnm() (equation

(56)) and the property [3]

dnm() = dmn(1) ,

i.e. the eect of c1 on vertex v1 is to change v 1
and v0j  vj thus eliminating the
dependence of the cycling transformations of every leg except leg e on the latter. the same can be
done to obtain the eect of conformal transformation c2 on vertex v 
2 , with the same results. so,
the eect of these transformations is to eliminate from the cycling transformations of the composite
vertex all dependence on the sewn legs e and f .

introduction of ghosts

we now introduce ghosts in the vertex so that what we must sew now are two vertices with some
ghost variables attached to them, i.e. we will be considering the physical vertices [4] which have
the correct ghost number. in this case, in addition to satisfying the overlap identities with the
conformal operator qi, the two physical vertices and the composite vertex must also satisfy some
overlap identities with the conformal operators bi and ci, given by [4]

bi(i) =

ci(i) =





xn=
xn=

n(i)n2 ,
bi

n(i)n+1
ci

where ci

n and bi

n are ghost anticommuting oscillators with anticommutation relations

n, bj
{ci

m} = n,m .

(67)

(68)

(69)

these operators have, respectively, conformal weights 2 and 1, what means that they transform
like

di(cid:19)2
bi(i) = (cid:18) dj
di(cid:19)1
ci(i) = (cid:18) dj

bj(j) ,

cj(j) .

the overlap identities for a vertex v with these operators are given by

v "bi(i) (cid:18) dj
di(cid:19)2
di(cid:19)1
v "ci(i) (cid:18) dj

bj(j)# = 0 ,
cj(j)# = 0 .

8

(70)

(71)

(72)

(73)

we shall be working here with overlap identities for the physical vertex u [4], which has the
correct ghost number, instead of the overlap identities for vertex v . the physical vertex is given
by [4]

u = v

yi=1

i6=a,b,c

from (80) we can see that there will be an anomalous term in the ci overlap of the physical
vertex u unless both legs i and j are precisely those legs (a, b or c) that do not have any ghosts
attached to them. these ghosts which are attached to all the other legs are responsible for the
anomalous terms.

3.1 analysis of the ghost number

before going any further, it is necessary to make some considerations on the ghost number of the
composite vertex. as we shall see shortly, in the case where we perform the sewing with ghosts

9

included, using the physical vertices, the resulting composite physical vertex will not have the
correct ghost number unless we insert some extra ghosts in vertex u1 before the sewing takes place.
considering this, we shall dene the composite vertex to be given by

uc = u1gp u 
2

(81)

where g are some extra ghosts that will be introduced in order to make vertex uc have the correct
ghost number and p is the propagator (in its integrated form).

we must now analyse the ghost number of the composite vertex and of its parts in order to
calculate the ghost number that the extra ghosts g must have. in order to do this, we shall use
the ghost number operator ngh. for a vertex with n legs, the ghost number operator is dened by

n gh =

n

xi=1



xn=1

ci
nbi

n 



xn=2

bi
nci




n
 .

the reason why the ghost number operator is a sum from i = 1 to i = n is because there are n
vacua that will aniquilate the operators corresponding to each one of them. when acting on the
physical vertex, this operator gives a ghost number n , what is the correct ghost number for a tree
vertex with n legs.

in the case of the composite vertex, it has n1 + n2  2 legs (because it does not have legs e
and f , which have been sewn together) and so it must have ghost number (n1 + n2  2). for this
vertex, the ghost number operator n gh

can be divided into two parts:

c

in order to calculate this, we must pay some attention to terms one and three of the right hand

side of the expression above. we know that

taking the hermitean conjugate of eq. (89) only on leg f , we obtain

since for n gh

(and for any arbitrary ghost number operator)

we must now remember that, in the composite vertex, we identify every operator on leg e with

operators on leg f so that n gh

the fact that uc has ghost number n1 + n2  2 then implies that

c = (n1 + n2  3)u1gp u

i.e. the extra ghosts that must be introduced in vertex u1 must have ghost number 1.6

1 + n gh

e i = g ,

(96)

(97)

there is an innite number of combinations of ghosts that have ghost number 1. we could have
any linear combination of ghosts of the type b, bcb, bcbcb, etc. but it will prove to be simpler to
choose g to be a combination of bs only so that we may represent it as

g =

n1

xi=1



xn=

nbi
i
n

(98)

where i
n are the coecients of the linear combination. in order to determine the correct linear
combination, we must use some other conditions, like brst invariance of the scattering amplitude.
this we shall see next.

6this contrasts with references [5] and [6] where it is claimed that the extra ghosts should have ghost number 1,

2 or 3, depending on the way one chooses legs e and f to have or not to have ghosts attached to them.

11

3.2 brst invariance

we must now impose that the scattering amplitude obtained from the composite vertex is brst in-
variant and check wether this condition is strong enough to determine g. the scattering amplitude
[1] is obtained by acting with the composite vertex

uc = u1gp u 
2

(99)

on a certain number of physical states (|1i|2i . . . |ni) and then by integrating over all variables
zi (i = 1, . . . , n1 + n2; i 6= e, f ):
w = z

2|1i|2i . . . |ni .

(101)

the rst and third terms will result in total derivatives that give zero when one integrates over
some variables [1] and so what remain are just the second and third terms.

the commutator p is given by a pure conformal transformation, and it is a function of the

generators le

n (n = 1, . . .) only. as the brst charge commutes with all le

n s, i.e.

we have

considering now that

we then have, for g given by (98),

(102)

(103)

(104)

(105)

in order for the scattering amplitude w to be brst invariant, expression (105) must be zero
or a total derivative (that can be integrated out to become a null surface term). at the same time,
we want these extra ghosts to place (talking in terms of the simple cycling) a ghost on one of the

12

legs in u1 that do not have any ghosts attached to them. if we now remember property (76), we
see that we can satisfy these constraints in a nice way by choosing g to be given by

g = (1)n1+a

n1

xj=1



xn=1

eaj
n bj
n

(106)

where a (a 6= e) is one of the legs of vertex u1 that does not have ghosts attached to it. inserting
these ghosts in vertex u1, we have

what is a total derivative that will vanish when one does the integration over za.

in references [5] and [6], the extra ghosts have been placed in the propagator. although this
can be done, there is no way one can derive a formula for the ghosts in the propagator for a general
cycling. in that case, the extra ghosts must be derived and brst invariance has to be checked for
each particular cycling. also, the resulting composite vertex obtained in that case is not similar in
its ghost structure to an ordinary tree vertex, although it has the correct ghost number.

3.3 overlap identities

we must now use the overlap identities to determine the propagator that satises them. in order to
do this we shall start with vertex u 0
i which
involve leg e. considering equations (79) and (80), the overlap identities for vertex u 0
1 between
an arbitrary leg i and leg e are given by (gure 12)

1 , which is the vertex with cycling transformations v 1

the extra ghosts must then be inserted in vertex u 0

13

(106)) and passing them through the overlaps we obtain (gure 13)

at this point, we must introduce conformal transformations of the type of c1, given by (30) in
order to have at the end the correct cycling transformations for the composite vertex. in order to
do this we need to use matrices enm(), dened by [5]

(114)

(115)

(116)

(117)

enm() =

1

(m + 1)!

which have the following properties:

m+1

zm+1 "(z)n+1(cid:18) 

z

z(cid:19)1#(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=0

1

xr,s=1

enp(1)epm(2) = enm(12) , n, m  1 ,

enr(1)ers(2)sm , n, m  2 .

(118)

the action of the operator c1 on the ghosts bi

n can then be calculated in the following way:

rst we write bi

n in terms of an integral over the conformal operator bi

n(i)

bi

n = i0i=0

d0i (0i)n+1bi(0i) .

14

(119)

then we insert the operator c1:

c1bi

1 = i0i=0
nc 1

d0i (0i)n+1(cid:18) d

d0i

v 1

i v0i0i(cid:19)2

bi(cid:16)v 1

i v0i0i(cid:17) .

after a change of variables i = v 1

i v0i0i we have7

c1bi

1 = ii=0

di (cid:16)v 1

0i vii(cid:17)n+1(cid:18) d

di

v 1

0i vii(cid:19)1

bi(i) .

(120)

(121)

using matrices enm(), we then may expand 0i in terms of i. if we also expand bi(i), we then
obtain





c1bi

nc 1

1 =

xm=1

xp=ii=0

di enm(v 1

0i vi)(i)m+1bi

p(i)p2 .

performing the integration we then have

c1bi

nc 1

1 =



xm=1

enm(v 1

0i vi)bi

m .

(122)

(123)

(124)

using (123) in equations (111) and (113) and multiplying (111) by (di/d0i)2 and (113) by

di/d0i, we then have (gure 14)

obtaining

and equation (123), we may then show that the result of acting with c 1

having done this, we must insert the propagator p into the overlap identities (124) and (125)
in the same way as in the case with no ghosts. but now we must take extra care since there are
terms depending on be

we have

the operators of the overlap equations are now facing leg f of vertex u

the overlap identities for this leg, we must now identify the operators of leg e with the ones of leg
f , which are adjoint operators:

first, as bf and cf are conformal operators with weights 2 and 1, respectivelly, we have

so that we must insert these ghosts into the expressions for the overlaps. before doing that, we
must notice that the extra ghosts acting on vertex v 0

transformation cf and the propagator p so that we must rst pass them through in order to reach
vertex u1:

what simplies things considerably. we shall call all cyclings that have such properties simple
cycling-like. in this kind of cyclings, each leg has its own ghost attached to it, with the exception
of three of the legs which have no ghosts attached to them. we will now consider three cases
separately: one in which none of the legs e or f have ghosts attached to them, one in which one
of these legs (say e) has a ghost attached to it, and a case where both legs (e and f ) have ghosts
attached to them.

the composite vertex for the case where neither e nor f (we choose e = b and f = g) have

ghosts attached is given by

we can see that, for each case, the composite vertex has the correct ghosts number (n1 + n2  2).

4 conclusions

using overlap identities, two vertices were sewn togehter in order to become a composite vertex.
the calculations have been done with the correct ghost numbers for each vertex and the result has
both brst invariance and the correct ghost counting.
