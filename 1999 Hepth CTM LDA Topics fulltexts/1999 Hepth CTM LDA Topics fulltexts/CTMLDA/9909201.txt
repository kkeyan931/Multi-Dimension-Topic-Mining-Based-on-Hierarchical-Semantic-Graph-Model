(2.10) 9 particular, since inverse transformation exist well, clear trivializing transformation locally invertible. also see since classically w 0 xed point, implementation (2.9) requires w b(qv) given terms w a(q) (times suitable jacobian) together additive term. words, ep immediately implies w states transform inhomogeneously. fact ep cannot consistently implemented classical mechanics (cm) true dimension. show let us consider coordinate transformation induced identication note cshje 1 2m scl v 0 (qv) = scl 0 (q).

(2.24) possibility reach state w v 6= 0 starting w 0 transforms inhomogeneous term. namely w 0 w v(qv) 6= 0, follows arbitrary w state w v(qv) = (pv|pa)w a(qa) + (qa; qv), (2.25) 11 (2.23) qv(qv) = (pv|pa)qa(qa) (qa; qv). (2.26) let us stress purely quantum origin inhomogeneous term (qa; qv) particu- larly transparent one consider compatibility classical limit (2.24) transformation properties q eq.(2.26). w 0 state plays special role. actually, setting w = w 0 eq.(2.25) yields w v(qv) = (q0; qv), (2.27) that, according ep (2.9), states correspond inhomogeneous part transformation w 0 state induced vmap. let us denote a, b, c, . . . dierent vtransformations. comparing w b(qb) = (pb|pa)w a(qa) + (qa; qb) = (q0; qb), formula qa qb interchanged (qb; qa) = (pa|pb)(qa; qb), particular (q; q) = 0. generally, comparing w b(qb) = (pb|pc)w c(qc) + (qc; qb) = (pb|pa)w a(qa) + (pb|pc)(qa; qc) + (qc; qb), (2.28) obtain basic cocycle condition expresses essence ep.

(2.30) f (b, q) = cn(q)bn j . xn=1 plugging expression eq.(3.16), nd xn=1 qj cn(q + b)c n j xn=1 ncn(q + c)bn1 j = xn=1 ncn(q)bn1 j . (3.18) furthermore, expanding cn(q + b) cn(q + c), follows eq.(3.18) n = 1 reads 1 (m 1)! qj cn(q) = n! n qj cm(q), 1 m! qj c1(q) = qj cm(q). 14 (3.19) (3.20) follows qj f (b, q) = qj cn(q)bn j = xn=1 1 n! xn=1 n qj c1(q)bn j = c1(q + b) c1(q), (3.21) upon integration qj yields f (b, q) = c(q + b) c(q) + g(b, q), (3.22) q denoting variables qj. moreover, (2.30) g(0, q) = 0. let us show g(b, q) identically vanishing. (2.32) f (b + c, q) = (q + b + c; q) = (q + b + c; q + b) + (q + b; q) = f (c, q + b) + f (b, q), (3.23) (3.22) implies g(b + c, q) = g(b, q) + g(c, q), (3.24) g(b, q) = g(0, q)bj. however, (3.17)(3.21) (3.22) bj f (b, q) = qj c(q + b) + g(0, q) = c1(q + b) + g(0, q) = ncn(q)bn1 j . (3.25) xn=1 then, setting bj = 0, nd last equality g(0, q) = 0. finally, left f (b, q) = c(q + b) c(q). (3.26) equation possible derive eq.(3.12). technical detailes reported appendix a. related reasonings, reported appendix a, show (aq; q) = a2f (aq) f (q), f (0) = 0, (3.27) (3.28) f function appearing eq.(3.12) 3.3 rotations let us consider (q; q), o(d). first all, qb = qa, see (pb|pa) = 1, = = 1d. hence, (2.32) ((q + b); q + b) = (q + b; q + b) = (q + b; q) + (q; q + b) = (q + b; q) + (q; q) + (q; q + b), (3.29) 15 implies ((q + b); q + b) (q; q) = f ((q + b)) f (q) + f (q) f (q + b). (3.30) therefore, (q; q) = f (q) f (q) + c. however, since (q; q) evaluated q = 0 cannot depend , (q; q)q=0 = (q; q)q=0 = (q; q) = 0. (q; q) = f (q) f (q). (3.31) 3.4 inversion let us consider inversion q(q) (3.8). jacobian matrix mapping given implies (j tj)jk = (j 2)jk = note q involutive since therefore kl r2 2 qkql r4 . r2 2 qjql r4 ! lk r2 2 qlqk r4 ! = jk r4 , j tjp pt pt p = 1 r4 . = q l qk jkl = = xl=1 jjljlk = qk (cid:18) ql r2(cid:19) = xl=1 jl (p|p) = (p|p)1 = pk p2 pk p xk=1 xk=1 r2 = q kq k = k 2 k 1 r4 qkqk = 1 r2 , (q) k = q k r2 = qk r2r2 = qk. observe since rotations leave r invariant, (q) j = (q)j r2 = jkqk r2 = jkq k = (q)j. finally, recognize following behaviour dilatations (aq) j = (aq)j r2 = aqj a2r2 = a1 qj r2 = a1q j , r2 = pd k=1 aqkaqk = a2r2. (3.34) (3.36) (q; q) = (p|p)(q; q) = 1 r4 ((q); q), implies (q; q) vanishes evaluated q0 solution q = q, one derives following result (q; q)|q=q0 = 0.

(4.48) fact, seen above, since implementation ep implies s0 never constant, (4.6). therefore, q(q) = xk=1 qk(qk) = h2 2m xk=1 krk rk h2 2m r r , = r(q) = qd k=1 rk(qk) satises continuity equation xk=1 k(r2ks0) = 0, (4.49) (4.50) s0(q) = pd onedimensional version {$9705108$}{$9809127$} k=1 s0,k(qk). consider following basic identity, generalizes 2(s0)2 = (res0) res0 r r r2 (r2s0), (4.51) holds constant functions r s0. then, r satises continuity equation setting = i/h, (r2s0) = 0, 1 2m (s0)2 = h2 2m (re h s0) h s0 + h2 2m r r . comparing eq.(4.43) (4.49) eq.(4.53) make following identication w(q) = v (q) e = h2 2m (re h s0) h s0 , q(q) = h2 2m r r .

(5.4) latter case, go steps nonrelativistic case stationary rqhje reads 1 2m (s0)2 + wrel h2 2m r r = 0, r satises continuity equation (r2s0) = 0. furthermore, (5.5)(5.6) imply stationary kleingordon equation h2c2 + (m2c4 v 2 + 2ev e2) = 0, = r exp(is0/h). 5.1 timedependent case (5.5) (5.6) (5.7) let us start noticing timedependent case, (d + 1)dimensional rchje cast form (later summation repeated indices understood) 1 2m sclscl + w rel = 0, minkowski metric diag (1, 1, . . . , 1), rel(q) = w 1 2mc2 , (5.8) (5.9) q (ct, q1, . . . , qd). thus recognize eq.(5.8) structure eq.(5.3), euclidean metric replaced minkowskian one. also case, order implement ep, modify classical equation adding function determined, namely 1 2m (s)2 + wrel + q = 0. (5.10) observe since w rel depends scl, make identication 1 2mc2 , wrel(q) = rel hamiltonian principal function appears rather (5.11) diers w scl. implementation ep requires arbitrary w state w b rel(qb) = (pb|pa)w 32 rel(qa) + (qa; qb), (5.12) time j jacobian matrix qb(qb) = (pb|pa)qa(qa) (qa; qb), (pb|p) = pb pb pp = ptjj tp ptp , j = q qb . furthermore, obtain cocycle condition (qa; qc) = (pc|pb)h(qa; qb) (qc; qb)i . reported appendix b, cocycle condition condition analogue condition (2.20), imply frel(s, 2s, . . .) = 0, ((q); q) = 0. 5.2 rqhje let us consider following identity 2(s)2 = 2(res ) res 2r r r2 (r2s), (5.13) (5.14) (5.15) (5.16) (5.17) (5.18) (5.19) holds constant functions r,s. then, r satises continuity equation (r2 s) = 0, setting = i/h h s) 2(re h (s)2 = 2r r h2 2m h2 2m 1 2m (5.20) + . aim prove (5.20) implies suppose wrel = h2 2m 2(re h s) h , qrel = h2 2m 2r r . wrel = h2 2m + g, h s) h 2(re 33 (5.21) (5.22) (5.23) correspondingly h2 2m 2r r g. (5.24) first all, seen system described s(q) = s(q), q = q + b, important property wrel(q) = wrel(q). furthermore, nd qrel = ( r2 s) = ( r2s) = 0. (5.25) comparing continuity equation (r2s) = 0, poincare transformations, rfunction transformed system dened s(q) = s(q) transformation property therefore, (5.18) (5.26) r(q) = r(q). g = h2 2m 2 r r q = h2 2m 2r r q = g, (5.26) (5.27) g scalar poincare transformations. implies g(q) may depend 2s0, (s0)2, r, 2r (r)2 higher derivatives invariant poincare transformations. however, timeindependent limit rqhje must reduce (5.5), particular qrel q. therefore, g must vanish limit implying then, rqhje reads g = 0. 1 2m (s)2 + wrel h2 2m 2r r = 0, r satisfy continuity equation (r2s) = 0. 5.3 nonrelativistic limit (5.28) (5.29) (5.30) section consider nonrelativistic limit rqhje. yield time dependent nonrelativistic qhje together timedependent schrodinger equation. perform classical limit rst need make usual substitution = mc2t taking limit c . wrel 1 2 mc2 + v, (5.31) (5.32) 1 2m (0s)2 ts 1 2 mc2, 34 (r2s) = 0 r2 + (r2s ) = 0. (5.33) therefore, nonrelativistic limit eq.(5.29) becomes (we remove r s) 1 2m (s)2 + v + ts h2 2m r r = 0, timedependent nonrelativistic continuity equation r2 + (r2s) = 0. easy see (5.34) (5.35) imply ih = h2 2m + v! , (5.34) (5.35) (5.36) = r exp(is/h). note used = r exp(is/h), would get complex conjugate (5.36). 6 gauge invariance ep section 5, derived rqhje arbitrary potential. byproduct, obtained timedependent schrodinger equation nonrelativistic limit. nice step indicates that, correctly implemented, ep must formulated exact framework, relativistic one. words, even timedependent schrodinger equation derived directly nonrelativistic framework {$9809127$}, natural realm implement ep approximate theory. fact, kleingordon equation follows naturally ep, derivation timedependent schrodinger equation less straightforward one derives directly nonrelativistic theory. however, even derivation rqhje perfectly consistent, formulation be- comes particularly transparent one works gauge theories. 6.1 minimal coupling ep point general considered w external xed quantity, corrections concerned scl, solves equation modied quantum potential. nevertheless, saw one considers relativistic extension, w contains itself. special relativity leads consider w composed external potential (see (5.9)). hand, standard qm problems generally correspond eective potentials. so, example, potential well, exist fundamental interaction. thus, nature 35 ep indicates formulated framework fundamental interactions. hand, since relativistic framework, interactions cannot strictly separated kinetic potential part. possibility included generalized kinetic term, w spacetime independent. clear xes interaction described terms minimal coupling. hand, minimal coupling prescription heart gauge theories. show ep simply implemented one considers minimal coupling prescription. let us consider interaction described terms electromagnetic = scl fourvector a. let us set p cl + ea pcl generalized one. case rchje reads particles momentum p cl = pcl a0 = v ec. note 1 2m (scl ea)2 + 1 2 mc2 = 0, w = 1 2 mc2, (6.1) (6.2) critical case corresponds limit situation = 0. usual, order implement ep, forced add correction (6.1) 1 2m (s ea)2 + 1 2 mc2 + q = 0. furthermore, transformation properties w b(qb) = (pb|pa)w a(qa) + (qa; qb), qb(qb) = (pb|pa)qa(qa) (qa; qb), (6.3) (6.4) (6.5) (6.6) (6.7) (6.8) , (pb|p) = j jacobian matrix (pb eab)2 (p ea)2 = (p ea)tjj t(p ea) (p ea)t(p ea) q qb . j = transformations imply cocycle condition (qa; qc) = (pc|pb)h(qa; qb) (qc; qb)i . proved subsection 5.1, (qa; qb) vanishes qa qb related conformal trans- formation. 36 usual consider relevant identity (generalized) kinetic term. 2(s ea)2 = d2res res 2r r r2 (r2(s ea)). = ea, d2 dd = 2 2ea + 2e2a2 e(a).

(6.13) (6.14) (6.15) similarly case function g eq.(5.27), also g scalar function poincare transformations. furthermore, since 0 limit reproduce eq.(5.29) wrel = mc2/2, see g = 0, (6.16) rqhje reads (s ea)2 + m2c2 h2 2r r = 0, r satisfy continuity equation (r2(s ea)) = 0. (6.17) (6.18) let us stress result directly obtained (5.1)(5.2) observing (5.8) coincides (6.1) setting wrel = mc2/2 replacing scl scl ea. 37 one check eqs.(6.17)(6.18) imply kleingordon equation (ih + ea)2 + m2c2 = 0, = h s. considered = h s, would complex conjugate (6.19) (ih ea)2 + m2c2 = 0. (6.19) (6.20) (6.21) timeindependent limit = ( v ec, 0, . . . , 0), tv = 0, (6.19) (6.21) re- duce stationary kleingordon equation (5.7). correspondingly, eq.(6.18) reduces stationary continuity equation (5.6) (r2(s ea)) = (r2s0) 1 c2 (tr2(v e) + r2tv ) = (r2s0) = 0. (6.22) 6.2 ep mass generation special property ep cannot implemented cm xed point corresponding w 0 0. implementing ep forces us introduce univocally determined piece classical hj equation. remarkable fact case rchje (6.1), xed point w 0(q0) 0 corresponds = 0. ep implies masses generated coordinate transformation. thus, masses correspond inhomogeneous term transformation properties w 0 state (6.23) mc2 = (q0; q). 1 2 furthermore, (6.4) (6.5) masses expressed terms quantum potential 1 2 mc2 = (p|p0)q0(q0) q(q). (6.24) basic feature formulation ep implies never trivial. so, example also case nonrelativistic particle v e = 0, nontrivial particular, {$9809127$} role quantum potential seen quantum potential {$9705108$}{$9809127$}. sort intrinsic selfenergy reminiscent relativistic selfenergy. eq.(6.24) provides explicit evidence interpretation. furthermore,  shown tunnelling direct consequence quantum potential. particular, q provides energy make p real, seen 38 response particle selfenergy external potentials. example also shows external potential particle energy strictly related, considered components single object. part, minimal coupling prescription provides. however, ep, naturally leads prescription, also implies additional quantum potential. {$9705108$}{$9809127$} shown contribution xed, rather may change hidden variables changed. particular, change corresponds mixing p2/2m term quantum potential. show higher dimension new degree freedom, represented antisymmetric tensor, related hidden variables. 6.3 ep hidden antisymmetric tensor qm basic property formulation immediately appears one dimension consider qshje. understand point useful recall dierence qshje one considered bohm, qshje written terms one function only: reduced action s0. always s0 6= cnst, bohm theory one s0 = cnst bound states. however, one excludes, implied ep, trivial solution, one obtain qshje standard version. one express r terms s0 solving continuity equation. show one tries write qhje higher dimension solving continuity equation, new eld appears. already encountered situation subsection 4.2. namely, saw continuity equation qshje implies r2s0 given generalized curl (d 2)form f . precisely, saw equation equivalent r2is0 = i2...id i2fi3...id . r2is0 = jbij, bij antisymmetric twotensor bij = i3...id ij fi3...id . words, 2form b hodge dual f continuity equation b = f, d+d+ f = ddf = 0. 39 (6.25) (6.26) (6.27) (6.28) (6.29) timedependent relativistic case f (d 1)form. 1f2...d = b, r2(s ea) = 1...d or, equivalently, r2 = (s ea) (s ea)2 b, r4 = bb (s ea)2 . terms b r rqhje (6.17) reads bb + r4m2c2 h2r32r = 0. (6.30) (6.31) (6.32) (6.33) ep appearance new eld indicates rqhje considered dierent context respect usual one. so, example, one may wonder beld may help considering possible quantum origin fundamental interactions. introduction suggested qm gr facets medal. generally one understand possible role qm underlying fundamental interactions or, precisely, whether ep underlies structure fundamental interactions trhough qm. already saw evidence dynamical role qm quantum potential {$9809127$}, e.g. considering tunnel eect. context one understand whether eq.(6.33) may provide dierent understanding usual problems one meets considering klein gordon equation. let us nd r transforms general vmaps, q q(q) = v(q). q system f2...d = q2 q2 . . . qd qd f2...d, (6.34) therefore 0...d ( 0 e a0) 1 f2...d = 0...d q0 q0 (0s ea0) q1 q1 q2 q2 . . . qd qd 1f2...d = det q q! 0...d (0s ea0)1f2...d, (6.35) used fact second derivatives jacobian matrix get cancelled due antisymmetry levicivita tensor. finally, (6.30) (6.31), r2 = det q q! (p|p)r2, 40 (6.36) holds also stationary nonrelativistic case (p|p) given (2.16). given (6.36), easily rederive transformation property r inversion q(q) derived subsection 4.3. fact (3.32) (3.33) det2(j 1) = det(r41d), det2 q then, (3.34) (p|p) = r4, obtain q! = det(r41d) = r4d, r2(q) = r2d4r2(q). (6.37) (6.38) convenient use (6.36) nd transformation property r inversion (b.4). (b.9) (b.10), r2(q) = (q2)d1r2(q). (6.39) appendix report proof eqs.(3.12)(3.27) (3.41) concerning structure function (qa; qb) cases qa qb related translations, dilatations inversion respectively. let us start considering function g(d, q) = (q + d; q), (a.1) arbitrary constant vector. terms g(d, q), eq.(3.11) yields g(d, q + b) c(q + b + d) + c(q + d) = g(d, q) c(q + b) + c(q). (a.2) taking derivative sides eq.(a.2) respect bj, get qj g(d, q + b) qj c(q + b + d) = qj c(q + b). setting bj = 0 integrating g(d, q) = c(q + d) c(q) + g(d, q), (a.3) (a.4) where, before, q denote components q qj, and, eq.(3.26), g(d, q) vanishes components dj zero. furthermore, plugging eq.(a.4) eq.(3.10), realize g(d, q) shares properties g(d, q). therefore, analogue eq.(a.4) holds g(d, q) well. hence, applying reasoning recursively end (q + d; q) = f (q + d) f (q) + h(d), (a.5) 41 h(d) vanishes whenever one component zero. however, (3.10), nd h linear implies h(d + e) = h(d) + h(e), h(d) = xk=1 akdk, h = 0, arrive eq.(3.12), note right hand side remains invariant constant shift (q + d; q) = f (q + d) f (q), f f + c. (a.6) (a.7) (a.8) (a.9) (a.10) let us analyze consequences (a.9) h(a, q) = (aq, q). (2.32) noting (p|pa) = a2, (a(q + b); q) = (a(q + b); q + b) + (q + b; q) = a2(aq + ab; aq) + (aq; q), (a.11) equivalent h(a, q + b) h(a, q) = a2 f (q + b) + f (q), b arbitrary vector. taking derivative respect bj qj h(a, q + b) = a3qj f (aq + ab) qj f (q + b), setting b = 0 nd upon integration yields qj h(a, q) = a3qj f (aq) qj f (q), h(a, q) = a2f (aq) f (q) + g(a). (a.12) (a.13) (a.14) (a.15) useful observation h(a, q) = (aq; q) evaluated q = 0 cannot depend a, h(a, 0) = h(1, 0) = 0. therefore g(a) = (a2 1)f (0), 42 (a.16) h(a, q) = a2(f (aq)f (0))(f (q)f (0)), that, upon relabeling f (q) f (q)f (0), coincides (3.27), (aq; q) = a2f (aq) f (q), f (0) = 0. note xes ambiguity (a.10). complete proof eq.(3.41). first note (2.32) ((aq); q) = (p|pa)((aq); aq) + (aq; q). hand, (2.32) (3.38) ((aq); q) = (a1q; q) = (p|p)(a1q; q) + (q; q), (a.17) (a.18) (a.19) (a.20) (3.27) a2((aq); aq) + (aq; q) = r4(a1q; q) + (q; q), (a.21) a2((aq); aq) + a2f (aq) f (q) = 1 r4  + (q; q). (a.22) picking q0 q 0 = q0 noticing r0 = 1, (3.40) (a.22) ((aq0); aq0) = a4f (a1q0) f (aq0). (a.23) observe q expressed aq0, = r q0 suitable solution q = q. furthermore, (3.38) a1q0 = (aq0), (a.23) equivalent eq.(3.41), (q; q) = 1 r4 f (q) f (q). (a.24) b section 3 showed that, consequence eq.(2.32), (qa; qb) vanishes identically qa qb related mobius transformation. present case, prove analogous result (qa; qb) vanishes qa qb related conformal transformation, conformal group, respect minkowski metric, generated translations q q + b, b rd+1, 43 (b.1) dilatations lorentz transformations inversion q aq, r, q q, o(d, 1), q = q q2 , (b.2) (b.3) (b.4) q2 = qq. note inversion welldened, rd+1 must completed cone innity {$9711028$}. space analogue rd+1. proof one provided section 3 appendix a. particular, (q + b; q) = f (q + b) f (q). (aq; q) = a2f (aq) f (q), (q; q) = f (q) f (q), (b.5) (b.6) (b.7) f arbitrary function satisfying f (0) = 0. far inversion concerned, proof needs slightly modied. jacobian matrix mapping given j = q = q q2 = q2 2 qq q4 , q4 (q2)2.

(b.10) (b.12) (q; q) = (p|p)(q; q) = 1 q4 ((q); q), implies (q; q) vanishes evaluated q0 solution q = q (q; q)|q=q0 = 0, (q; q)|q=q1 = (q; q)|q=q1, q1 satises q = q. (5.16) ((aq); q) = (p|pa)((aq); aq) + (aq; q). hand, (5.16) (b.14) ((aq); q) = (a1q; q) = (p|p)(a1q; q) + (q; q), therefore, (b.6) a2((aq); aq) + a2f (aq) f (q) = 1 q4  + (q; q). picking q0 q 0 = q0, eq.(b.20) yields ((aq0); aq0) = a4f (a1q0) f (aq0). (b.15) (b.16) (b.17) (b.18) (b.19) (b.20) (b.21) observe q, q2 > 0, expressed aq0, a2 = q2, q0 suitable solution q = q. furthermore, (b.14) a1q0 = (aq0), (b.21) equivalent (q; q) = 1 q4 f (q) f (q), q2 > 0. hand, picking q1 q 1 = q1, eq.(b.20) yields ((aq1); aq1) = a4f (a1q 1) f (aq1) + a2(f (q1) f (q 1)) + a2(q; q)|q=q1. taking = 1, (b.23) becomes (q1; q 1) = f (q1) f (q1) + f (q1) f (q1) + (q 1; q1), which, virtue (b.17), equivalent (q 1; q1) = f (q 1) f (q1). 45 (b.22) (b.23) (b.24) (b.25) hence, (b.23) becomes ((aq1); aq1) = a4f (a1q 1) f (aq1). (b.26) observe q, q2 < 0, expressed aq1, a2 = q2, q1 suitable solution q = q. furthermore, (b.14) a1q 1 = (aq1), (b.26) equivalent thus, general (q; q) = 1 q4 f (q) f (q), q2 < 0. (q; q) = 1 q4 f (q) f (q). however, also relativistic case analogue condition (2.20) then, reasoning subsection 3.5 leads frel(s, 2s, . . .) = 0. therefore, state following result f = 0.
