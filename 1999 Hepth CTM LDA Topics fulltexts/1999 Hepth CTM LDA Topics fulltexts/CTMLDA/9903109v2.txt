abstract

we present a new type-iib supergravity vacuum that describes the strong coupling regime
of a non-supersymmetric gauge theory. the latter has a running coupling such that
the theory becomes asymptotically free in the ultraviolet. it also has a running theta
angle due to a non-vanishing axion eld in the supergravity solution. we also present
a worm-hole solution, which has nite action per unit four-dimensional volume and two
asymptotic regions, a at space and an ads5  s5. the corresponding n = 2 gauge
theory, instead of being nite, has a running coupling. we compute the quarkantiquark
potential in this case and nd that it exhibits, under certain assumptions, an area-law
behaviour for large separations.

1 introduction

one of the well-known vacua of type-iib supergravity is the ads5  s5 one, rst de-
scribed in [1]. the non-vanishing elds here are the metric and a freundrubin type
anti-self-dual ve-form. this background has received a lot of attention recently be-
cause of its conjectured connection to n = 4 su(n) supersymmetric yangmills (sym)
theory at large n [2, 3]. according to this conjecture [2], the large-n limit of certain
superconformal eld theories (scft) can be described in terms of anti de-sitter (ads)
supergravity; correlation functions of the scft theory that lives in the boundary of ads
can be expressed in terms of the bulk theory [3].
in particular, the four-dimensional
n = 4 su(n) sym theory is described by the type-iib string theory on ads5  s5,
where the radius of both the ads5 and s5 are proportional to n.

however, one is interested for obvious reasons in non-supersymmetric ym theories. in
particular, the existence of supergravity duals of such theories will help in understanding
their strong-coupling behaviour. there are a number of proposals in this direction. one
of them is within the type-ii0 theories [4, 5, 6], which, although non-supersymmetric,
are consistent string theories [7]. these theories have a tachyon in their spectrum due to
lack of supersymmetry. the tachyon is coupled to the other elds of the theory, namely,
the graviton, the dilaton and the antisymmetric-form elds. in particular, the coupling
of the tachyon to the dilaton is such that it drives the latter to smaller values in the
ultraviolet (uv), a hint for asymptotic freedom.

however, a dierent approach has been proposed in [8]. according to this, the super-
gravity duals of non-supersymmetric gauge theories are non-supersymmetric background
solutions in type-iib theory. based on this, a solution with a non-constant dilaton that
corresponds to a gauge theory with a uv-stable xed point has been found [8]. the
coupling approaches the xed point with a power-law behaviour. the solution is valid
for strong t hooft coupling g2
h, which is consistent with the fact that there are no known
perturbative eld theories with uv-stable xed point. this scenario has also been fol-
lowed in [9]. the same power-law behaviour as in [8] has also been found in the case
of an n = 2 boundary gauge theory from a supergravity vacuum with both d3- and
d7-branes [10].

2 a non-supersymmetric solution

here, we will try to describe a celebrated feature of gauge theories, namely the asymp-
totic freedom, within the type-iib theory. as we will see, this is possible if we make a
minimal extension to the solution we found in [8] by turning on the other scalar eld of
type-iib, the axion. the anti-self-dual ve-form f5 is given by the freundrubin-type
ansatz, which is explicitly written as

and it is clearly anti-self-dual. we will also assume, for the metric, four-dimensional
poincare invariance iso(1, 3), since we would like a gauge theory dened on minkowski
space-time. in addition, we will preserve the so(6) symmetry of the supersymmetric
ads5  s5 vacuum. as a result, the iso(1, 3) so(6) invariant ten-dimensional metric,
in the einstein frame, is of the form

ds2 = gdxdx + gijdxidxj ,

(2)

where

gdxdx = dr2 + k(r)2dxdx ,

(3)
and gij is the metric on s5. the dilaton and the axion, by iso(1, 3) so(6) invariance,
can only be a function of r. in the euclidean regime, the supergravity equations for the
metric, the dilaton and the axion in the einstein frame follow from the action [11]

note the minus sign in front of the axion kinetic term, which is the result of the hodge-
duality rotation of the type-iib nine-form [11]. then the eld equations, taking into
account the anti-self-dual form as well, are

the equation of motion of the ve-form is the anti-self-duality condition, which is satised
for the ansatz (1). for the particular case we are considering here, the above equations
turn out to be

and

(11)
equation (11) is automatically solved for a ve-sphere of radius 2/, and a rst integral
of the axion in eq. (10) is

rij = gij .

 = 0k4e2 ,

(12)

where the prime denotes derivation with respect to r, and 0 is a dimensionless integration
constant. with no loss of generality, it can be taken to be positive by appropriately
changing the sign of r. using this expression for  in (9) we obtain the dierential
equation

a rst integral of which is given by

k 4(k 4) = e22
0 ,

k 82 = 2

0e2 +  .

(13)

(14)

equations (12) and (14) are sucient to proceed and solve for the function k(r) that
appears in the metric (3). the non-zero components of the ricci tensor for the metric
(3) are

k
k 2 ,

rrr = 4
r = (cid:16)kk + 3k2(cid:17) ,

and (8) is equivalent to the following dierential equation

k2 =

k 2 .

the solution of the above equation for  = 2 > 0, as a function of r, is

k 4 =

r  r0 ,

(15)

(16)

(17)

where r0 is an integration constant. it should be noted that the case  < 0 gives rise
to a dilaton with bad asymptotics and it will not be considered here. substituting the
expression in (17) in (14) and (12), we nd that the string coupling and the axion are
given by1

it is convenient to identify the parameters  and  in such a way that, in the limit
r  , the einstein metric becomes that of ads5  s5. this requires that  =
46r3e4r0/r and  = 4/r2. on the other hand, r cannot take arbitrarily large values

1the computation is greatly facilitated if we rst change variables as

z =z k 4dr =r 3

22 ln coth(cid:16)(r0  r)(cid:17) .

since, at r = r0, the function k(r) has a zero and the space is singular in both the einstein
and the string frames. the presence of this singularity makes the extrapolation from the
uv region, where the space is ads5s5, to the ir region problematic, which is ultimately
related to the lack of supersymmetry. as we will see next, there are supersymmetric
backgrounds that are non-singular in the sense that there are geodesically complete.

3 a supersymmetric solution

the aspect we would like to address here is supersymmetry. for this we need the fermionic
variations [11], which are written, in our background as

1

2 (cid:16)e + (cid:17) r ,

(20)

(21)

where , m are the dilatino and the gravitino, respectively, and m are the -matrices.
we may easily check, using (14), that the background is supersymmetric for

 = 0 ,

 = e .

(22)

in that case, there exist killing spinors  = e/4 where  are killing spinors on the
(euclidean) ads5  s5. by choosing  = e, the background breaks half of the
supersymmetries and we nd that

k(r) = er/r ,

e = gs +

(23)

(24)

(25)

after changing coordinates as  = rer/r, the metric for the supersymmetric solution in
the string frame becomes

ds2 = (cid:18)gs +
= r2(cid:18) 0

thus, the background is conformally at and it has two asymptotic regions

   ,

ads5  s5 .

the action of this vacuum is easily found, following [11], to be

s =

c =

22 0r5v (s5)z d4x .

(28)

(29)

(30)

thus, it has a nite value per unit four-dimensional volume.
in addition it has the
standard 1/gs scaling of d-branes. as a result, this solution can be interpreted as an
interpolating soliton between at space and euclidean ads5  s5. we also note that this
solution corresponds to the large size limit of the d-instanton solutions of [12, 13].

concerning the above solution, we would like to stress that it breaks half of the
supersymmetries even in the two asymptotic regions, where the space is either at or
ads5  s5. thus, the corresponding boundary gauge theory will be an n = 2 sym
theory, which, however, will have running coupling, as we will see. hence, it should be
dierent from the one obtained by orbifolding the n = 4 theory [14].

4 running couplings and the

quark-antiquark potential

in order to discuss the running of couplings, we must identify the coordinate in the bulk
that corresponds to the energy in the boundary gauge theory. we identify the energy in
the bulk as u = r2er/r and also dene an energy scale u1 = r2er0/r, which, since
u > u1, may be considered as the ir cuto. the identication of the energy follows from
m e2ggm n n  =
the fact [15] that if one considers the massless scalar equation 1g
0, where gm n is the -model metric, this takes the form of the usual scalar equation in
ads5  s5 to leading order in the expansion for large u. according to the ads/cft
correspondence, the dependence of the bulk elds on u may be interpreted as energy
dependence of the boundary theory such that long (short) distances in the ads space
corresponds to low (high) energies in the cft side. in particular, the u-dependence of
the dilaton denes the energy dependence of the ym coupling g2
ym = 4e, as well as of
the t hooft coupling g2
ymn. according to this we nd the running of the t hooft
coupling to be

h = g2

(31)
where g0 = 30/r4. as we see, gh vanishes asymptotically, the signal of asymptotic
freedom. it should be stressed, however, that the t hooft coupling approaches zero with
a power law and not with the familiar perturbative logarithmic way. note also that
g(0) = 4, in accordance with the universal behaviour for the rst derivative of the

,

gh = g0(cid:16)u1

+ o(cid:16) u1

beta function for the coupling that was found in [8]. in the supersymmetric solution in
particular, one nds, by using (24), that the beta function is

(gh) = 4(gh  gh) ,

(32)

where g2

h = 4ngs.

next we turn to the quarkantiquark potential corresponding to the supersymmetric
solution of section 2, by computing the wilson loop. using standard techniques [16, 17]
we nd that the potential is

eq q = (cid:16)  u0 +

(33)

(34)

it turns out that, for a1/4/r2l  1, the rst term in (33) is dominant, resulting in
the usual coulombic law behaviour [16, 17]. the rst correction to it is o(l3), as in
[8, 10], which is also similar to the behaviour one nds [18] using near extremal d3-
branes to describe nite-temperature eects in the n = 4 su(n) sym theory at large
n. however, in the opposite limit of a1/4/r2l  1, the second term in (33) dominates,
giving

eq q 

a1/2
2r2 t l .

(35)

hence, the quarkantiquark potential exhibits the typical conning behaviour and pro-
duces the area-law for the wilson factor. the plot of the potential (33) is given below.

a second criterion [19] for connement is the existence of a mass gap in the theory.
in our case it is straightforward to check this, by examining the massless wave equation
and realizing that the einstein metric is just ads5  s5.

at this point we emphasize that since we go into the strong coupling regime for
u = 0, we should introduce an infrared cuto uir such that u  uir. this does not
aect the behaviour in the uv, but it has consequences in the ir. it implies that there
is a maximum length lir, up to which (35) can be trusted. under this assumption, the
range of validity of (35) is a1/4r2  l  lir.

just before submitting our paper to the hep-th we received [20], which overlaps with

material in section 3.
