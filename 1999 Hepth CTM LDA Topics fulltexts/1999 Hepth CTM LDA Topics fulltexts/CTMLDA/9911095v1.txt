abstract

this text is an attempt to give a pedagogical introduction to the
ads/cft correspondence. we try to present the main ideas and ar-
guments underlying the subject, starting with a brief sketch of old string
theory statements and proceeding with the denition of d-branes and a
description of their main features. we end up with observation of the
ads/cft correspondence and the arguments that favor it.

introduction

a long standing problem is to nd a string description of yang-mills (ym)
theory [1]. although we do not aim to review this problem, we would still like
to explain what the problem is, since we are going to discuss a progress in its
solution for some simplied situations.

in the mathematical description of any phenomenon one needs to nd some
exactly solvable approximation to it and some small parameter which we can
expand over in order to approach the real situation. in the case of ym theory
such a good approximation at large energies is in terms of free vector particles.
they carry quantum numbers taking values in the adjoint representation of a
non-abelian gauge group and the small parameter in question is the coupling
constant g2

ym [1].

however, there is a problem in this description in that quantum eects cause
the coupling constant to grow as one approaches large scales or small energies.
furthermore, at some scale the description in terms of the fundamental ym
variables is invalid due to singularities in the perturbative theory [1]. as a result,
nobody knows how to pass to low energies in ym theory. thus the question
appears: what is the approximation to ym theory which can be applicable in
both regimes?

the most promising approach to this problem is to consider su (n ) ym
theory as n   [1]. in this limit the perturbation series drastically simplies
[2] and the only graphs which survive look like triangulations of sphere. this is
one of the hints (see [1] for another ones) that there could be a string description
of ym theory in this limit, i.e. a description in terms of a two-dimensional theory
representing these triangulations. furthermore graphs which contribute to the
triangulations represent a series expansion in powers of g2
ymn (which is taken
nite as n  ) rather than simply in powers of the ym coupling constant
g2
ym [2]. while the torus and all graphs having topologies of spheres with more
than one handle are suppressed by powers of 1/n 2. thus 1/n 2 would be the
small parameter in expansion over which one could approach the real situation.
why should we prefer the description in terms of string theory? the point
is that string theory has a very well developed and powerful apparatus for
calculating amplitudes of various processes [1, 3, 4] and, moreover, one could
hope to solve it. this would help at least in the case that one is able to nd a
string description of ym theory in terms of one of the standard string theories
[1, 3, 4].

in the case of ordinary ym no one has yet succeeded in nding such a string
description, but in the conformaly invariant supersymmetric ym (sym) theories
there has recently been a considerable progress [5, 6, 7, 8]. it is worth mentioning
that the string description of conformal ym theories is of pure academic interest
since we really know dynamics of these theories at all scales. but one might
hope that such a string description could reveal some features of string theory
for the ordinary ym.

there are several non-anomalous and self-consistent string theories which are
supersymmetric (susy) in the target space  space where the string evolves.
the target space should be ten-dimensional, since otherwise there is no well
developed apparatus of calculation of the superstring amplitudes [1, 3, 4]. at
the same time, the string world-sheet is two-dimensional universe swept out by
a string during its time evolution. there are innitely many ways to excite the
world-sheet theory giving dierent quantum states of the string. each of them
looks like a particle living in the target space. among these particles there is
a nite number of massless ones, while all other particles have masses of the
order of the string tension (scale), which is usually taken to be very big (small).
hence, at scales bigger than the string one (exactly when the strings look as
point-like objects) only the massless particles survive and they are described by
a eld theory in the target space rather than string theory.

2

among the massless closed string excitations there is a symmetric tensor
particle, which, due to the symmetry properties of string theory, has exactly
the same number of degrees of freedom as the graviton. the only large scale
theory (i.e. that which contains the lowest powers of the derivatives of elds)
which could describe the graviton is einstein-hilbert gravity in the target space.
as can be rigorously shown [1, 3, 4] it is this theory (interacting with the other
massless string excitations) that one gets from string theory at large scales. at
the same time in the case of superstring theory one gets supersymmetric gravity
(sugra).

it is also possible to get sym theory interacting with sugra if one includes
open strings in the theory along with closed ones. this is because the lowest
energy excitation of the open string is a vector particle with the proper number
of physical polarizations to be a gauge boson.

bearing that in mind, one could say that there is a string theory for four-
dimensional sym. in the situation under consideration, superstring theory gives
a regularization of sym theory. in fact, superstring theory is nite and valid at
any scales, while at large scales it leads to the theory containing ten-dimensional
sym. four-dimensional sym could appear after a compactication. to set the
latter one could consider ten-dimensional world as a product of non-compact
four-dimensional space-time with a compact six-dimensional space.

one might question the necessity of such a string description of four-dimensional

sym theory: the latter is a well dened theory in the ultra-violate region. how-
ever, if one would solve superstring theory, i.e. one would know its dynamics at
all scales, then we will also know completely sym dynamics. but this is unsat-
isfactory because at the string scale when we get such a superstring description
of four-dimensional sym we also have to deal with quantum gravity and the
dimensionality of space-time is ten rather than four.

fortunately there has recently been discovered new ways of adding open
string sectors to the closed ones. they lead to new ways of coupling sym
theory to sugra and to nd them one has to add a stack of n d-branes to
closed string theory in such a way that it respects susy. the world-volumes of
the d-branes are multi-dimensional sub-manifolds of the target space on which
open strings terminate [9]. moreover, the string ends are conned to these sub-
manifolds, while closed strings can still live in the bulk of the target space.
hence, in the world-volume of the stack of d-branes at low energies one sees
u (n ) sym theory [10] (in the case considered below it will be four-dimensional
superconformal ym), while in the bulk there is the standard sugra.

thus, strings which could describe sym theory are attached to our four-
dimensional world (d3-brane world-volume) while uctuating in the bulk of
target space [9, 5]. to specify the string description one has to nd the ge-
ometry in which the strings uctuate. to do this one must probe the d-brane
from the outside: from the bulk. at the same time, the theory as seen by an
observer when travelling further and further from the d-brane could change
uncontrollably, for we really do not know the complete string theory dynamics.

3

to overcome this diculty one has to force the d-branes to respect some part
of susy transformations in superstring theory. let us explain why.

in statistical mechanics or quantum eld theory if one goes from small to
large scales, it is necessary to average over all uctuations in the theory with
wave-lengths smaller than the scale in question. this could lead to a change
of parameters in the theory. for example, if one places a charged source into
a plasma it is screened, because opposite charges to the source are attracted,
while the same are repelled. a very similar situation happens in the qed: if one
places a charge in the vacuum, the latter is polarized. this is because vacuum is
not empty but lled with virtual pairs. it is the simplicity of the system which
allows us to predict how the charge of a source will vary as one approaches it.
what is most important is that the description in terms of the fundamental
qed variables could be applicable up to quite small scales.

however, in ym the situation is more complicated. firstly, the non-linearity
of the theory causes anti-screening [1] and secondly, as we mentioned, how the
charge of the theory varies with respect to the distance, is known only up to
some low energy scale. as a result, a proper low energy description of strong
interactions is still unknown. similar things could happen in any non-linear
theory, such as gravity or string theory, for example.

the dierence in the presence of susy is that bosonic and fermionic degrees
of freedom can be exchanged in the theory [15].
it is this symmetry which
causes the cancellation between screening and anti-screening due to fermions
and bosons. the latter happens only if a source respects some part of susy
transformations, i.e. it is the bogomolni-prassad-sommerfeld (bps) state [11].
this fact is related to so called non-renormalization theorems of susy theories
(see, for example, [15, 4]). although the situation is not that simple, we hope
that the reader has gotten at least the avor of how it works.

thus, the presence of susy helps to nd how geometry is curved in the
d-brane background. for example, the characteristic curvature of the d-brane
is proportional to g2

ymn in the units of string tension.

let us explain now what is new in the d-brane case in comparison with the
old string theory. first, in this case one could deal directly with four-dimensional
sym theory. second, it happens that one could vary the regularization scale for
the eld theories living on the d-brane world-volume and make it much smaller
than the string one [5]. this works as follows: after a regularization of a theory
we are missing the information about high frequency modes and the high energy
theory underlying the one in question should contain this information. what
happens in the d-brane case is that high enough frequency modes of the elds
living on their world-volumes could escape to the bulk of the target space: they
could create closed strings living in the bulk [12]. however, the closed strings
with energies smaller than the brane curvature can not escape to innity [13]
but instead they stay in the throat region - the strongly curved part of the
bulk target space in the vicinity of the d-brane. this is because the excitations
which live very close to the d-brane nd it hard to climb over the gravitational

4

potential and escape to the asymptotic region.

in conclusion, we need only the theory in the throat in order to respect
unitarity [5, 14, 6]. thus, if the limit n   and gym  0 is taken in such a
way that g2
ymn << 1 we have the full string theory in the throat regularizing
the sym on the d-brane world-volume [6]. because, this is the limit when the
size of the d-brane throat is very small only string theory could be applicable.
however, at energies smaller than the string scale if limits n   and gym  0
are taken so that g2
ymn >> 1 we could apply classical gravity. in fact, the size
of the throat is very big in this situation. we mean that in this limit the
string theory for the sym is described by the classical superstring in the throat
background, i.e. a string description of sym before gravity becomes quantized.
this relation between sugra in the bulk and sym on the d-brane is referred
to as ads/cft correspondence. the reason for this is that in the simplest
situation, considered below, the throat geometry is of anti-de sitter (ads) type
(with constant negative curvature), while on the d-brane there is that sym
theory, which is conformaly invariant.

the aim of this text is to introduce the reader to the notion of d-branes
and ads/cft correspondence. for self-consistency we included two chapters
devoted to string theory. in the rst chapter we try to present the main ideas
of string theory using the example of bosonic string theory. then in the second
chapter we proceed with the denition of type ii superstring theories and with
the review of their massless spectrum. after presenting superstring theory, we
introduce the notion of d-branes in the third chapter and show their relation
to gravity solitons and to sym theory. we conclude with the ads/cft corre-
spondence. for completeness we have included the discussion of the bps states
in the appendix.

unfortunately, it is impossible to present in detail the whole of these subjects
even in a big book, hence, our presentation is sketchy. we hope that it highlights
the main ideas and gives some food for thought about the matters in question.
we are not trying to review this broad subject, and our reference list is therefore
far from complete. a more or less complete one can be found in [16].

2 bosonic string theory

at present only the rst quantized string theory [1, 3, 4] is fully constructed.
this is quantum mechanics of string world-sheets, which are two-dimensional
spaces swept by a quantum string during its time evolution in a target space.
similarly to the relativistic particle the action for the relativistic string is pro-
portional to the area of its world-sheet:

s  z d2pdet|gab|,

gab = a xb x

(1)

5

where a, (a = 1, 2) are coordinates on the world-sheet and x(), ( = 0, d 1)
are two-dimensional functions describing embeddings of the string into the d-
dimensional at target space.

however, this action is nonlinear and, hence, dicult to quantize. to make
it quadratic in x one invents a new dynamical variable into the theory 
string intrinsic metric hab [1].
in this case the strings are described by the
two-dimensional -model interacting with two-dimensional gravity:

sst =

1

2 z d2hhaba xb x +

1

2 z d2h,
hab  h1
ab .

h = det|hab|,

(2)

here  is the inverse string tension. usually it is taken to be much smaller than
any scale which is probed by experiments until now. on the level of the classical
equations of motion hab  gab. hence, the latter action is classically equivalent
to the former one (1). on the quantum level, however, these two theories are
dierent, at least naively (see, however, [1]). in fact, in the former theory one
sums, in the functional integral, just over all possible string world sheets, i.e.
over embeddings x. while in the latter case one sums over all possible metrics
on each world-sheet and over the world-sheets themselves.

from now on we will be dealing with the theory (2). this theory is invariant
under the reparametrization transformations: a  fa(b), which represents
general covariance on the string world-sheets. via this two-parametric symme-
try one could get rid of two components of the metric: ds2 = habdadb =
e(z,z)dzdz, where z = e1+i2 . for a world-sheet with spherical topology this
can be done unambiguously, while for torus and higher topologies  only up to
the freedom in choosing a complex structure [3, 4]. we are not explaining what
the complex structure is, because we are not going to use this notion (except
the fact that it exists) anywhere below.

after the reparametrization gauge xing is done our action is still invariant
under the conformal transformations: z  f (z) and e(z,z)  |zf (z)|2e(z,z),
zf (z) = 0. using them it is possible to get rid of the internal metric:

s

st =

1

2 z d2zz xz x + fadeev  popov ghost

terms.

(3)

this is completely true only classically.

in fact, on the quantum level of
the -model (2) there is the conformal anomaly [3, 1, 4]. the corresponding
symmetry is broken because of quantum eects. hence, the (z, z) eld becomes
dynamical. it is necessary to cancel the anomaly since otherwise it is not yet
known how to calculate the string theory correlation functions [1]. the anomaly
is canceled only if d = 26.

furthermore there is a remnant of the reparametrization invariance on the
world-sheets with higher topologies, which is referred to as modular invariance.

6

the modular transformations act on the complex structures [3, 4]. one must
respect also this invariance, because otherwise there will be problems with grav-
itational and gauge anomalies in the target space, and hence unitarity would be
violated.

generating functional

only if all those symmetries are respected one can properly dene the fun-

damental quantity of bosonic string theory:

z (g, b, , t ) =



xg=0

zg =



xg=0z [dhab]gdxesst(x,hab,g ,b ,,t ).

(4)

here the measure dx is as for d scalars, while [dhab]g should be properly
dened using reparametrization, conformal and modular invariances [1].
the sum in this formula is over the genus g of the string world-sheets. this
is an expansion over string loop corrections, which are present in addition to the
already mentioned -model quantum corrections. if one considers only closed
strings these correction are represented by spheres with g handles, otherwise
they are discs with holes and handles of the total number2 g.

we start with the discussion of the closed bosonic string. in this case the

action in (4) looks as follows:

sst (x, hab, g , b, , t ) =

1

2 z d2nhhabg (x)a xb x +
+iabb (x)a xb x + hr(2)(x) + ht (x)o,

(5)

where ab is the completely anti-symmetric tensor in two dimensions and r(2)
is the two-dimensional scalar curvature for the metric hab.

now we see that the dilatons vev  gives the coupling constant for the

string loop expansion:

zg  exp(cid:26)



2 z d2hr(2)(cid:27) = e2(g1) = g2(g1)

s

,

(6)

furthermore substituting g =  , b = 0,  = 0 and t = 1 into (5), one
gets for sst the former expression (2).

the physical meaning of z (g, b, , t ) is that it is the generating functional
for the amplitudes of interactions only between the lowest energy string modes.

2it is worth mentioning at this point that open string theory contains closed one on its
loop level. in fact, the annulus amplitude (the rst loop correction in open string theory) is
equivalent to the cylinder amplitude (the tree level in closed string theory).

7

in fact, we can get the latter via variations of the functional z over the sources
g, b,  and t (see below). we are interested only in the lowest energy states
because one needs to nd the behavior of string theory in the classical limit
(large scales) where we could use what is known from our world. this is the
reason why we do not include any other sources into the functional integral (4),
(5).

low energy spectrum

why do the operators in (4) with the sources g, b,  and t correspond
to the lowest energy states? first of all let us explain how a two-dimensional
operator is related to a string state at all. the action of an operator on the
vacuum of the conformal theory (2) excites it. if we take a particular harmonic
of a source (for example, t : eip x :), it looks, from the target space point of
view, as some moving string in a particular quantum state - plane wave.
furthermore it is not necessary to modify the functional integral (4) to de-
scribe interactions of string states. this is one of the main dierence of string
theory from particle one. it relies on the two fundamental facts. first, in con-
trast to particle paths, for any disconnected set of one-dimensional manifolds it
is always possible to nd a two-dimensional string world-sheet which has these
manifolds as components of its boundary. this world-sheet represents the feyn-
man graph for a string amplitude and its boundary represents initial and nal
states of a process in string theory. second, because of the conformal symmetry,
one always could get rid of external legs in a string amplitude. we mean that by
a conformal transformation it is possible to shrink them (and each component
of the one-dimensional boundary) to the points on the world-sheet where the
corresponding vertex operators are acting.

now, to see why operators in question correspond to the lowest energy ex-

citations, let us consider an n -point correlation function [1]:

an = z

n

yj=1

d2j < o1(cid:16)x(1)(cid:17)...on(cid:16)x(n )(cid:17) >,

(7)

where the average < ... > is taken within the functional integral (4) with the
action (2). also oj are some operators with conformal weights3 j equal to
2, so that integrals of them over d2j are conformaly invariant. among these
operators there could be those present in (5). for example:

og = g : z xz x : .

(8)

3the denition of the conformal weight j of an operator oj is as follows: oj(cid:16)j(cid:17) =
j oj(cid:16)j(cid:17).

8

it has a well dened conformal weight if g = f : eip x :, where f is some
polarization.

in the integral (7) there is a region where 1  2, for example. close to it
one could use locality of the theory expressed in terms of the operator product
expansion (ope):

lim

12 oi(1)oj(2)  xk

cijk |1  2|kj i ok(1),

(9)

where the sum in the rhs runs over the whole basis of local operators in the
theory. using the ope, one nds [1]:

an = z d2z

where a(k)

3  c12k < o1o2ok > and we have taken the integral over || up
now we could use the fact that the operator t (x) =: eip x() : has the
conformal weight equal to p2
/2. one can nd it using the wicks theorem for
the two-point correlation function of this operator [1] and the greens function
for x from (2). furthermore for g proportional to : eip x() : we have the
conformal weight for the operator (8) equal to p2
/2 + 2. the same conformal
weights have operators with b and  proportional to : eip x() :. likewise for
other sources (not present in (5)) which also proportional to : eip x() : one
gets p2
/2 + k. where k > 2 are due to the local operators which stand near
sources like in the eq. (8).

thus, in any channel where i  j we have in the rhs of (10) the sum
over all propagators of string excitations each corresponding to some operator
ok:

an = xk

a(k)
3 a(k)
n 1

p2


.

(11)

in conclusion, there is a relation between conformal weights of operators ok and
masses of the corresponding string states m2
. our observation shows
that t describes a tachyonic state with m2
 , because t = 0. at
the same time g, b and  describe massless states (g,b, = 2), while all other
operators correspond to massive ones (k > 2).

k = 2 k2

t = p2

 =  4

9

statement

bearing that in mind, we could consider the string theory at scales (set by
g, b,  and t ) much bigger than . first, in this case one can substitute
separate quanta (8) by smooth elds: pretty like the case of passing from pho-
tons to radio waves. second, in this situation massive string excitations are
decoupled. this means that we have to get a eld rather than string theory in
this limit. in fact, a free string is equivalent to innitely many free particles:
the string propagator is just an innite sum of particle propagators (11). hence,
forgetting about massive particles gives a sum in (11) of nitely many massless
ones.

this way in the limit in question and when d = 26 one nds [17]:

z(g, b, , t ) =

h 2

16n z d26xge2hr + 4g

(12)

which is 26-dimensional dilaton gravity interacting with anti-symmetric tensor
s 12 is the 26-dimensional newtons constant;
h  [b]. here n  g2
from now on o(, n ) schematically represents two-dimensional -model and
string loop corrections.
if you will, the latter contribution is due to string
massive modes.

the equation (12) should be understood as follows. in the limit when   0
the z functional gives exactly the same feynman vertices and propagators as
the leading contribution in the rhs of (12).

there is a way to understand, without a derivation, why one should get this
particular action (12) from the string theory. the g and b elds in (5) are
invariant, as one can see, under the following innitesimal transformations:

g  g + ()
b  b + [],

(13)

among which the rst one is nothing but the general covariance of (12).
it
is necessary (but not sucient) to respect these invariances to maintain the
unitarity of the theory. now our goal would be to nd a large scale eective
action for the sources in z, which is invariant under the transformations in
question. it is easy to see that the action in (12) is the only low energy one
which obeys these conditions and includes the interactions with the dilaton .
the reason why z = s(sources) rather than z = es(sources) is that we
are dealing with rst quantized string theory. there is also another way [1, 3, 4],
related to the one presented here,of deriving the eq. (12), but we are not going
to discuss that here.

10

open bosonic string theory

now let us consider open bosonic string theory. to maintain poincare in-
variance in the target space one naively (see the fourth chapter) could think of
using only the newman boundary conditions on the coordinates x of the open
strings.

as we have already mentioned, open string theory contains closed one at
the loop level. hence, the open bosonic string theory contains all the same
sources in its generating functional as in (4). besides that, in the open string
theory there are sources for its own excitations. furthermore at the ends of an
open string one could add quantum (chan-paton) numbers, taking values in
the fundamental representation of a gauge group.

thus, following the same reasoning as above one could nd the massless

open string vertex operator to be a path-ordered wilson exponent:

trp exp(cid:26)izboundary

a(x)~t xd(cid:27) ,

(14)

where ~t is a tangential derivative to the strings boundary and  is some
parametrization of the latter. the presence of the operator (14) in (4) means
that the ends of the strings are charged with respect to a. it is a gauge eld,
taking values in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. in fact, the eq.

(14) is invariant under the gauge transformations: a  a +  + iha, i.

similarly to the closed bosonic string theory the open string generating func-
tional is equivalent at large scales to the 26-dimensional gravity interacting with
the ym theory for the gauge eld a.

some philosophy

let us discuss for a moment possible relation of string theory to quantized
gravity and its unication with gauge interactions. the action (12) is written
through the use of so called string metric. from the latter one can pass to
the ordinary einstein metric through the rescaling: ge = ge4. hence, the
26-dimensional einstein-hilbert action appears as a part of the large scale or
classical approximation to quantum string theory. moreover, both gauge and
gravity theories could be treated on the same grounds: as approximations to
string one. furthermore one could get four-dimensional theory via so called
compactications [3, 4]. to do that one considers 26-dimensional world as a
product of non-compact four-dimensional space with some very small compact
22-dimensional one.

all that seems very promising. however bosonic string theory contains the
tachyonic excitation t : m2
 . this is a pathological excitation. for
its presence means that during the quantization we have chosen an unstable

t =  4

11

vacuum, because of its imaginary energy. moreover higher self-interaction terms
for the tachyon seemingly do not seal this instability. hence, one does not know
a true vacuum or even whether it exists at all in bosonic string theory.

3 type ii superstring theory

to get a sensible string theory one should add susy [3, 15]. there are several
non-anomalous ways of doing that, which lead to dierent types of superstring
theories. here we are going to discuss only closed type ii strings in the neveu-
schwarz-ramond (nsr) formalism.
in this case susy is added by the aid
of the anti-commuting  elds which are world-sheet super-partners of x.
in principle one also has to add the world-sheet metric and its super-partner.
however, as in the bosonic string theory via xing the symmetries of the theory
we could get rid of them.

thus, as a starting point there is the n = 1 two-dimensional sugra in-
teracting with the conformal matter represented by x and  [1, 3, 4]. this is
the susy extension of the action (2). due to the presence of the conformal in-
variance the sugra symmetry of the action is enhanced to the superconformal
one. as we discuss below, it is necessary to do some extra work to get sugra
in the target space.

we consider here the hamiltonian quantization4 of the type ii superstring

theories. the free superstring is described by the action (z = e1+i2 ):

ssst =

1

4 z d2z(cid:0)zxzx + z + c.c.(cid:1) +

+fadeev  popov ghost

terms,

(15)

where we have got rid of the world-sheet metric and of its super-partner by the
use of the susy reparametrization and superconformal invariances.

in the theory (15) one have to impose the standard periodic boundary con-
ditions on x: x(1, 2 + 2) = x(1, 2). at the same time, to respect the
aforementioned modular invariance one has to include into quantum theory of
superstrings the sectors with both types of the possible boundary conditions on
the fermions [1, 3, 4]. the rst is of the (r)amond type:

while the second is of the (n)eveu-(s)chwarz type:

(2 + 2) = (2),

(16)

(17)

(2 + 2) = (2).

4after presenting the idea of the main statement of string theory, we would like to present
some other way of its quantization. besides that, for our purposes, in the case of superstrings
the hamiltonian quantization [3] is more transparent than the functional integral approach
[1].

and the same for . therefore, there are two kinds of mode expansions for
solutions of the free two-dimensional dirac equation z = 0:

(n s).

(18)

there is also similar but independent expansion for (z). for it is the conformal
invariance which allows us to treat the left (z) and right (z) sectors indepen-
dently: in conformal eld theory they are not interacting with each other.

we do not consider the mode expansion for x because corresponding cre-

ation operators do not lead to massless excitations.

quantization and massless spectrum

to quantize superstring theory (15), one imposes the standard (anti-) com-
mutation relations on the bosonic (fermionic) modes. then the modes dn and
with positive and negative ns become, correspondingly, annihilation and
cn+ 1
creation operators. at the same time, the zero modes 
0 generate the algebra
of dirac -matrices:

0 , 

{

0} =  .

(19)

now superstring states are constructed by the multiplication of a state from
the left sector to a state on the same level from the right one. thus, one has,
depending on the relative boundary conditions in the left and right sectors, four
kinds of states:

n s  n s n s  r
r  r .
r  n s

(20)

to nd masses of excitations one have to consider the two-dimensional

energy-momentum tensor:

t (z) = t11 + t22  2it12 =

(21)

in the left sector. there is also the complex conjugate energy-momentum
tensor in the right sector t (z). corresponding conserved hamiltonians are
l0 = r dzt (z) in the left sector and similarly l0 in the right one. hence, the
total hamiltonian is h = l0 + l0 +const, where const comes from the normal

13

ordering and depends upon a sector (r or n s) [3, 4]. having the latter, it is
easy to nd the lowest energy sates [3, 4]:

and similarly in the n s and r sectors. here |0 >, in the r sector, is dened
below, while |0 > in the n s sector is the standard vacuum for fermions.
furthermore to maintain the modular invariance one must project in the
both left and right sectors on an eigen-state of the operator (1)f [3, 1, 4].
here f counts the world-sheet fermionic numbers of operators in the theory. we
mean that one must consider the partition function as z = tr(cid:2)(cid:0)(1)f  1(cid:1) eh(cid:3)
with either plus or minus sign rather than just z = tr(cid:2)eh(cid:3). this is so called

one can verify that after a susy reparametrization gauge xing there are
super-virasoro conditions on the physical states of superstring theory [3, 4].

5it is this kind of gso projection which leads, after the account of the both left and right
sectors, to the appearance of susy in the target space. in fact, the anti-diagonal elements in
(20) lead to the target-space superpartners for the diagonal ones [3, 4].

they appear as the standard conditions of the dirac procedure in the hamilto-
nian quantization. they are:

z x  |state >= 0,

(26)

which is nothing but the conditions of the superconformal invariance of super-
string theory.

now from the rst condition in the second row of (26) it follows that:

the gso projection keeps one among these states (8c or 8s) and removes

(27)

one concludes that there could be two types of theories. if we choose the opposite
signs for the vacua of the r and r sectors, one gets non-chiral type iia theory.
if we choose the same sign, then one gets chiral type iib theory.

in conclusion, in the r sector the lowest energy state (25) has target space
fermionic quantum numbers [3, 4]: depending upon a choice (27), it is ether one
chirality fermion | > or another |  >. it means that in the r  r sector there
are states as follows:

(iia)  (cid:16)[1...n+1](cid:17)  |  > or
(iib)  (cid:16)[1...n+1](cid:17) |,  >,

(28)

where  are ten-dimensional dirac matrices in the weyl-majorana represen-
tation. these states correspond to the bosonic tensor elds a1...n with the
eld strengths f1...n+1 = [n+1 a1...n]. now we see that due to the chirality
properties of the lowest energy states, in the type iia theory there are only odd
rank a elds. while in the type iib only even rank a elds are present.

the type ii string theories invariant under two susy in the target space
(q and q), which correspond to the left and right sectors on the world-sheet,
respectively [3, 4]. this is the reason why one refers to these string theories as
type ii.

15

type iib superstrings at large scales

for our purposes we mostly will be considering here the type iib string
theory (the type iia theory is very similar) with its bosonic elds. besides the
standard n s  n s elds g, b and , the theory contains the following r  r
elds: the scalar a, two-form tensor potential a , four-form tensor potential
a and their duals. in fact, by construction, among the elds described in
(22)-(28) there are various duality relations:

f1...9 = 1...1010 a
f1...7 = 1...10f 8910
f1...5 = 1...10f 6...10.

(29)

here 1...10 is the completely anti-symmetric tensor in ten dimensions.

similarly to the bosonic string theory, superstrings contain target space
sugra at large scales.
in the case of superstring theory it is known how
to calculate its generating functional only if d = 10, when the superconfor-
mal anomaly is canceled. thus, the bosonic part of the large scale type iib
ten-dimensional sugra action looks as follows [3, 4]:

s 4 is the ten-dimensional newtons constant. furthermore
here n = 86g2
in this action one have to impose the self-duality condition on the r  r four-
form eld as shown in the last row of the eq. (29). there are also various dual
versions of the type iib sugra, which are expressed through the dual tensor
elds (29).

thus, we see that superstring theories are self-consistent and lead at large
scales to that of sugra. now we are ready to discuss various solitons in sugra
and string theories.

16

4 d-branes and sugra solitons

in sugra theory there are plenty of dierent solitons [4, 19]. in ten dimensions
they could be particle-like black holes or dierent types of branes (membranes
etc.) which are multi-dimensional analogues of the black holes. their singu-
larities live on multi-dimensional sub-manifolds of the ten-dimensional target
space and surrounded by multi-dimensional event horizons. they could be neu-
tral or charged with respect to some tensor gauge elds (like b or r  r
elds discussed in the previous section) similarly to the way in which point-like
black-holes could be charged with respect to gauge vector elds.

now, having in mind the fact that string theory suggests us quantization of
gravity, one could ask what are quantum analogues of these solitons? besides
an academic interest, the answer of this question could reveal some features of
black hole thermodynamics [4, 18]. furthermore, as we will see below, it gives
a relation between sym theory and sugra.

the problem is that to pass from the large scale gravity to quantum string
theory one has to vary the parameters  (measured with respect to a charac-
teristic scale) and gs of the theory. it happens that during this variation in a
background the corrections o(, n ) in (30) could become more relevant than
the leading large scale contribution. as we briey discussed in the introduction,
they even could change the form of the background completely. first, it leads
to the destruction of such a notion as event horizon, which appears to be a low
energy global characteristic [6, 4]. better to say the size of the horizon of a
soliton could become smaller than the string scale. second, it might lead to an
uncontrollable renormalization of the charge and tension of a soliton or even to
a change of the fundamental degrees of freedom in the theory, since we have no
a complete knowledge of string theory dynamics.

however, in the presence of susy one could control renormalization of the
low energy (large scale) action. furthermore there are solitons (excitations or
states, if you will) in susy theories for which renormalizations of their mass
and charge are under control [11]. they are referred to as bps solitons and
respect at least some part of susy transformations in such theories. the latter
fact should be contrasted with arbitrary excitations which do not respect any
symmetries. while the fact susy is respected is crucial because it makes strong
restrictions on possible dynamics [15].

furthermore, among the bps solitons in string theory quantum counterparts
are found only for those which are charged with respect to the r  r tensor
elds. for only in the latter case a good two-dimensional conformal eld theory
description exists. although historically there were rstly found bps sugra
solitons, charged under the r  r elds, [19] and only then their quantum d-
brane description [9], we start our discussion with the denition of the d-branes.
then we explain their relation to sugra solitons and to sym theory.

17

denition of the d-branes

one could wonder if it is possible to consider open string sectors in the closed
type ii superstring theories. it appears that to avoid anomalies [4] open strings
in these sectors should also have dirichlet (d) boundary conditions on some
part of the string coordinates [9]:

~nxm = 0, m =  m, m = 0, ..., p (n ewman)
xi = c i, i =  i
i = p + 1, ..., 9 (dirichlet),

(31)

where c i are some xed numbers and ~n is a normal derivative to the string
boundary. therefore, in such a situation the ends of open strings can freely move
only along m directions.
in fact, they are conned to (p + 1)-dimensional
sub-manifolds placed at xi = ci in the ten-dimensional target space. these
sub-manifolds, lling all m directions and situated at xi = ci, are referred
to as dp-branes. at the same time in the bulk of the target space there are
ordinary type ii closed strings.

the dp-branes have several features which are interesting for us. first,
they break poincare invariance in the target space p (10)  p (1 + p)  so(9 
p). hence, to maintain it, one should consider these dp-branes as dynamical
excitations in superstring theory. second, to respect susy one must consider
p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 for the type iia and p = 1, 1, 3, 5, 7 for the type iib theories
[4] (see below). third, because of the boundary conditions (31), the dp-branes
could respect only half of susy transformations in the type ii string theories. in
fact, the two susy transformations (due to q and q) are related to each other:
the left and right sectors on the string world-sheets are no more independent
because of the boundary conditions.

in a particular gauge of their world-volume reparametrization invariance,

the dp-branes are described by the following quantum states [9]:



z (g, b, ,{a}, a, , f ermions) =

xg=0z [dhab]gdx (f ermions) 
esdst(x,hab,g ,b ,,{a},a,,f ermions)
where sdst (x, hab, g , b , ,{a}, a, , f ermions) =
= ssst (x, hab, g , b, ,{a}, f ermions) +
+iz d  am(xm)  ~t xm + iz d  i(xm)  ~n xi + f ermions.

(32)

here  is some parameter on the boundary. this is not a partition function but
a quantum state because the integral over x is taken with boundary conditions
(31). as usual closed strings appear on the loop level with respect to these open

18

strings. hence, in this formula ssst is a superstring analog of the action (5)
with sources for the corresponding massless excitations: g, b, , r  r elds
{a} and their superpartners.
let us explain, following [10], the origin of the sources am and i in the
eq. (32). as we have already noticed string theory should be invariant under
the transformations (13). for a closed string they are easily respected. when
we break the string, however, there are boundary terms appearing after such
transformations. hence, to maintain the rst among the invariances, one must
add i eld at the string boundary. it should transform as i  ii/ under
(13). while the boundary term appearing due to the transformation (13) in the
m directions vanishes, because poincare invariance is respected there. hence,
i appear as would be pure gauge degrees of freedom if there were not the
breaking of poincare invariance in the presence of the dp-brane. furthermore
from this consideration it is clear what is the physical meaning of these elds.
they represent transversal uctuations of the dp-brane around its position ci.
better to say ci are just vevs of the elds i.

likewise, to maintain the second invariance in (13) the boundary should be
charged with respect to an abelian gauge eld am. in this case the boundary
term appearing after (13) could be compensated by the shift am  am m/.
(this shift is dierent from the ordinary gauge transformation am + m of
the eld am.) the physical meaning of the eld in question is that it describes
longitudinal uctuations of the dp-brane.

d-branes at low energies

at energies much smaller than 1/, the z functional (32) leads to the

following target-space action [20]:

z (g, b, ,{a}, a, , f ermions) = sii (g, b, ,{a}, f ermions) +
+mpz dp+1ehpdet (gmn + bmn + 2fmn)i +
+qpz dp+1  0...p  a0...p + f ermions + o(, n ),

(33)

where again we skipped fermionic terms;  is some parametrization of the dp-
brane world-volume; 0...p is the 0...p component of the (p + 1)-dimensional
completely anti-symmetric tensor, and

fmn = [man],

gmn = gijminj + gi(mn)j + gmn,
bmn = bijminj + bi[mn]j + bmn.

(34)

are eld strength for am, induced metric and b eld on the dp-brane world-
volume.

19

gs (cid:0)42(cid:1) p+1

action. in the case of type iib string theory sii is given by the leading contri-
bution in (30). the second contribution in (33) is so called dirac-born-ineld

in this formula sii is type ii ten-dimensional (sii  r d10x...) sugra
(dbi) action for the non-linear (p + 1)-dimensional ( r dp+1...) electrody-

namics. its coecient is the mass per unit volume of the dp-brane and is equal
[4] to mp = 

2 .

furthermore the third term shows that the dp-brane is the source for the
r  r tensor eld a in the 0...p directions. hence, the dp-branes are charged
with respect to the (p + 1)-tensor r  r elds with charges equal to qp [9].
taking into account special properties of the r  r elds (discussed under the
eq. (28)), it is clear why there could be only p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 for the type iia
and p = 1, 1, 3, 5, 7 for the type iib theories [4].
what is important for our further discussion is that the action (33) is susy
invariant, because dp-branes (32) respect half of it in the type ii string theories.
due to this fact the following equality holds:

mp = qpl(p+1)

st

where

lst 



(35)

and the force between any two equivalent and parallel dp-branes vanishes [4].
in fact, since the equality in question holds the repulsion due to the r r tensor
eld compensates the gravitational attraction.

d-branes as sources for the r  r sugra solitons

now let us probe a dp-brane at large scales, i.e. when r = xixi >> .
we remind once more that it is the susy invariance of the action (33) which
allows us to go easily from a large to small r (and vice versa) and the leading
contribution in (33) does not change. hence, in the process of going to a large
r we could just forget about the dp-brane excitations am and i. we mean
that a large distance observer does not feel them and one could substitute in
(33) their classical values: am = i = 0 without sources. thus, if there is no
background of the elds g, b and , we have:

z = sii + mpz dp+1 + qpz dp+1  0...p  a0...p + o(, n ),

(36)

the second and the third terms in this equation are just sources for the cur-
vature and the corresponding r  r eld. they could be rewritten as follows
r dp+1...  r d10x(9p)(xi  ci)... . hence, solutions of the classical equations
of motion for (36) with these sources appear to be so called bps r r sugra
solitons:

(37)

where p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 in the type iia and p = 1, 1, 3, 5, 7 in the type iib
theories [19].
all these solutions are bps and for any function fp they preserve half of
the susy transformations in the theory. the equations of motion of the theory
(related to the closure of the susy algebra) imply [19] that fp should obey

here (9p) is the laplasian in the at directions p + 1, ..., 9. hence, one gets:

(9p)fp(r) = mp  (9p) (xi  ci)

(38)

fp = 1 +(cid:18) rp

r (cid:19)7p

,

(39)

where rp  1/m
. this is the way how one nds a relation between the
dp-branes and some sugra solitons: the latter are large scale (classical) coun-
terparts of the former ones.

p+1
p

it is worth mentioning at this point that there are p-brane solitons which
are smooth in the following sense. one could throw out from the target space
the sub-manifold where there is the source in the rhs of (38). if the target
space would be at there will be singularity on this sub-manifold. in a curved
space, however, there might happen that the singular sub-manifold is innitely
far away. exactly this is true for the metric in (37). however, this metric is
written in the string frame, while in the einstein metric the region r  0 is
not innitely far away, because the dilaton in (37) diverges. however, for the
d3-brane in the type iib theory the dilaton is constant, and hence the r  r
3-brane is a smooth soliton.

d-branes and sym

now let us probe a dp-brane at small scales r << rp and gs  0 (to
suppress corrections o(, n )). in this case one could forget about long wave-
length uctuations of the bulk elds g, b,  and {a}. hence, they are equal
to their classical values, i.e. to zero in the absence of external sources. thus,
expanding (33) in powers of a small fmn, one gets:

z = sii + ssqed + o(, n ) where
2|mi|2 + ...(cid:21) .

dots in the second row stand for the fermionic terms. the latter could be
recovered from the fact that this susy qed (sqed) is maximally supersym-
metric in (p + 1) dimensions. in fact, we know from (32) the number of susy
transformations under which the theory (40) is invariant.

there is also another way to nd the number of susy. one could consider

the ten-dimensional n = 1 (maximally supersymmetric) sqed:

il =

1
2

f 2
 +

 

i
2

(41)

where  are majorana-weyl spinors and super-partners of a. now let us make
a reduction of the theory to (p + 1) dimensions. that is when one consid-
ers all the elds in the theory to be independent on (9  p) coordinates [15].
this way, changing notation from ai to i, one gets the theory (40) with the
proper fermionic content. furthermore during this procedure the number of
susy is increased with respect to n = 1 in ten dimensions [15]. in fact, the
ten-dimensional fermions  are rearranged into representations of the smaller
poincare group p (p + 1), hence, from the one fermion we get several.

the low energy action (40) also could be found from another point of view
[10]. at low energies strings which terminate on a dp-brane look as the massless
vector (am) and scalar (i) excitations - the lowest energy excitations of an
open string [3]. furthermore in the limit gs  0 the coupling of open strings
attached to the dp-brane with closed ones in the bulk is suppressed. at this
point one nds that the low energy theory for such excitations is susy qed 
the only supersymmetric and gauge-invariant action containing smallest number
of powers of derivatives and elds.

the last point of view helps to understand low energy theory describing
a bound state of dp-branes [10]. let us consider n parallel dp-branes with
the same p. we can do that safely, because they do not interact with each
other. in this situation in addition to the strings which terminate their ends
on the same dp-brane, there are strings stretched between dierent branes.
furthermore because strings in the theory are oriented, between any two dp-
branes there could be two types of stretched strings. the strings attached with
both their ends to the same dp-brane give familiar massless vector excitations
living on the brane. on the other hand, the stretched strings give vectors with
masses proportional to distances between corresponding dp-branes. they are
charged with respect to the gauge elds living on the dp-branes at their ends.
therefore, the latter vector excitations are similar to the w -bosons in a gauge
theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking. they acquire masses through the
higgs mechanism (splitting of dp-branes) and become massless when the dp-
branes approach each other. hence, one nds that the world-volume theory on
a bound state of n dp-branes is nothing but u (n ) maximally supersymmetric
sym theory [10]:

and dm = m + i [am,] .

,

(42)

dots in this action stand for fermionic terms. furthermore all possible positions
of the dp-branes, composing the bound state, are vevs of the u (n ) matrix i.
hence, for example, the u (1) factor in the decomposition u (n ) = su (n )u (1)
describes the center of mass position of the dp-brane bound state.
unfortunately we do not know any rigorous derivation of (42) from rst
principles and from the denition of the dp-branes. though, there is a non-
canonical way to formulate the non-abelian version of (32), (33), and hence of
(40) [21].

anyway, to sharpen the readers understanding let us give one more argu-
ment in favor of the appearance of sym from the dp-branes. when one has
a stack of dp-branes, strings which terminate on them carry chan-paton in-
dexes, enumerating the dp-branes. hence, one would get sources like (14) for
their massless excitations, where ai  i. this, as we know, leads at large
scales to sym theory and shows that the theory (42) is the reduction of the
ten-dimensional n = 1 sym to (p + 1) dimensions.
it is worth mentioning at this point that one could also consider bps bound
states of dierent types of dp-branes (with dierent ps) [4]. however we are
not going to discuss them here.

5 ads/cft correspondence

thus we see that the same objects (dp-branes) have two dierent descriptions
depending on at which distance we are looking at them. from far away they
look like sources for some gravity solitons, while at small distances one sees
quantum uctuations of the d-branes described by sym theory. it seems that
both limits are unrelated to each other. however, this is not a complete truth.
to understand why, from now on we are going to discuss the simplest situation.
we consider a stack of n d3-branes in the ten-dimensional type iib sugra
theory. the d3-branes are on top of each other at x4 = ... = x9 = 0 and ll
0, ..., 3 directions. corresponding sugra soliton is the self-dual r r 3-brane
(37),(29) with

are six-dimensional dirac matrices. one could see
i
from this formula that 4gs = g2
ym. this theory has zero -function because of
the perfect cancellation of quantum corrections due to the bosons and fermions.
hence, gym is just a non-renormalizable constant and at any its value the theory
is invariant (besides gauge invariance) under the susy extension of the so(5, 1)
group. which is the superconformal group of the euclidean four-dimensional
space.
at the same time, type iib sugra description is valid when r >> .
but if the limit n   and gs  0 is taken so that gsn >> 1 then from (43)
we get r3 >> . hence, sugra description could be applicable even in
the throat region (when r  r3). in fact, r  r 3-brane is the smooth soliton
with the curvature in the throat equal to r3 and string theory corrections to
the sugra are suppressed by powers of /r3.

qualitative observation

now we could understand what is going on at low energies (  0 and
n  0) from the point of view of an observer at innity [6, 16]. on one
side, according to (40), in the bulk there is the free ten-dimensional sugra.
it is free because all interactions are suppressed as n  0 (with respect to a
characteristic scale in the theory):

s 

1

n z d10xgr + ...  z d10xh(h)2 +pn (h)2 h + ...i .

(45)

here we have substituted the metric as g =  + n h, where  is the at
metric and h are small uctuations around it. at the same time the d3-brane
excitations are described by the u (n ) sym theory (44).
in the latter the
su (n ) part is decoupled from the bulk gravity for the same reason as the bulk
gravity becomes free (45). while the u (1) part, describing the center of mass
degrees of freedom, is still coupled to the bulk sugra.

on the other side, again an innite observer sees at low energies the free
ten-dimensional sugra. but now, according to (36) and (37), it is decoupled
from the throat region (r < r3 in (37)) of the self-dual (29) r  r 3-brane:

5 where

z =

or

(46)

which is ads5  s5 geometry. in fact, the bulk massless particles decouple from
the near horizon region (around r = 0), because their low energy absorption
cross section by the d3-branes goes like   3r8
3 [12], where  is the energy.
this could be understood from the fact that in the low energy limit wave-lengths
of particles in the bulk become much bigger than the typical gravitational size
of the brane r3. similarly, the excitations that live very close to r = 0 nd
it harder and harder to climb the gravitational potential and escape to the
asymptotic region.

in conclusion, there are two pictures describing the same phenomenon:

in
both cases we have two decoupled theories in the low energy limit. in both cases
one of the decoupled systems is sugra in the at space. so, it is natural to
identify the second systems which appear in both descriptions [6].

what is most important for this consideration is that the theories which are
decoupled from the free sugra have nite (non-zero) energies [6]. in fact, the
gtt component of the 3-brane metric is not a constant. hence, the energy er of
an object as measured at a constant position r and the energy e measured
by an observer at innity are related by the red-shift factor:

e = f

 1
3 er.
4

(47)

from this it follows that the same object, having nite energy, as brought closer
and closer to r = 0 would appear to have smaller and smaller energy for an
observer at innity.
thus, we are led to the conjecture that at any energy smaller than 1/
the n = 4 su (n ) sym theory in four-dimensions is related to the type iib
sugra theory on ads5  s5 with the ux of the self-dual (29) four-form r r
eld. the relation is as follows: there is quantum type iib superstring theory
on ads5  s5 with the r  r background, which is valid at any energies and
yet to be understood. at energies smaller than 1/ the type iib superstring
theory has two degeneration limits. one of them (g2
ymn  gsn << 1) looks as
3/2  gsn >> 1) is the type
the n = 4 sym at large n , while the other (r4
iib sugra on the background in question.

the relation

one might ask the question: what is the formula which describes the corre-
spondence between the sym and sugra theories? as an answer to it, a more

25

exact formulation of the statement was suggested in [7, 8]. it establishes that
as gsn  , while gs  0 and n  , we have:

< e

pjr j j

0 oj d4x

smin(ads5s5)|

> e

j j |b j

j

0 .

(48)

where the average on the lhs is taken in the strongly coupled large n su (n ),

n = 4 sym theory and (cid:8)oj(cid:9) is a complete set of local operators in it. while on
the rhs smin is the type iib sugra action minimized on classical solutions
for all its elds. they are represented schematically as jj. these solutions have
asymptotic values j j|b  j j
0 at the boundary of the ads5 space [8]. the latter
serve as sources in the lhs. thus, we see that the type iib sugra in the bulk
of the ads space is related to the sym living on the boundary of the space.

before discussing the meaning of this relation let us bring to the readers
attention that it is similar to the relation (12) in string theory. we mean that
in this case sugra theory appears as an eective theory of sym. one of the
dierences from string theory is that now we get z = es(sources) because
sym is second quantized theory.

unfortunately, there is no any rigorous derivation of the equality (48). hence,
the best we could do at this moment is to present dierent points of view on it
and to give some self-consistency arguments in its favor.

additional arguments

 first, this relation passes through the simplest symmetry check [8].

in
fact, from (48) it follows that the sym theory lives on the four-dimensional
boundary of the ads5 space. this space has the so(5, 1) group of isome-
tries, which acts on the boundary as the group of conformal transforma-
tions. hence, sugra in the bulk of the ads space, invariant under this
symmetry, should correspond to a theory on the boundary which is su-
perconformal. as we mentioned, this is the case for the n = 4 sym
theory.

 second, from that it is clear how one nds which operator on the lhs is
related to a eld on the rhs. the method is based on the matching of
the symmetry properties of elds (rhs) and operators (lhs) under the
group so(5, 1) [16]. non-trivially, it appears that for each sugra eld
in the chiral representation of the (susy extension of) so(5, 1) group
there is a sym operator transforming in the same representation [16] and
vice versa. there are also some other symmetry arguments in favor of the
validity of the ads/cft correspondence [26, 16], which we are not going
to discuss here.

besides that, occasionally from another construction we also know sym
operators, which correspond to the massless elds in the ads sugra.

26

in fact, their leading values in the  expansion could be found from the
non-abelian version [21] of the action (33). for example, the component
of the graviton in ads5  s5 which does not depend on the coordinates
of s5 corresponds to the energy momentum tensor of the n = 4 sym.
while that of the dilaton is coupled to the n = 4 sym action itself.

 third, bearing that in mind, let us examine the relation (48) in more
details. following [7, 8], we consider the component of the dilaton, which
is independent of the coordinates of s5. its action in the ads5 background
looks as follows [7, 8]:

s() =

2r8

32n z d4xdz

1

z3 h(z)2 + (m)2i .

(49)

it is divergent for those classical solutions which are regular on the bound-
ary [7, 8]. this is due to the innite volume of the ads5 space. to regu-
larize this divergence one could shift the boundary from z = 0 to z = .
this is an infrared (ir) regularization of the ads sugra.

now any classical solution with (z = , x) = (x) could be expanded in
those which obey (z = , x) = eikmxm
, where km are four-momenta [8].
the unique [8] solution with the latter boundary condition is [7, 8]:

(xm, z) =

(kz)2k2(kz)
(k)2k2(k)

eikmxm

where k = |km|.

(50)

here k2 is the modied bessel function. the action for this solution is
equal to [7, 8]:

smin()  n 2z d4xz d4y (x)(y)
where (x) = eikmxm
at the same time the generating functional in sym picture looks as fol-
lows:

(2 + |xm  ym|2)4 + o(2), (51)

.

z() = z dam...  expn

mn + ...(cid:17)o.

(52)

dots in this equation stand for the superpartners of am. now (x) is
some source. according to (48) and (33) it should be equal to the dilatons
boundary value (z = , x).

27

integrating over the sym elds in (52), we get:

z() = const  expnconst z d4xz d4y (x)  (y) 
np(y) + ...(cid:17) > +...o.

lm(x) + ...(cid:17)  tr(cid:16) f 2

 < tr(cid:16) f 2

(53)

up to the quadratic order of the dilaton. because of the n = 4 susy we
know exactly the value of the correlator

< tr(cid:16) f 2

lm(x) + ...(cid:17)  tr(cid:16) f 2

np(y) + ...(cid:17) >

n 2

|xm  ym|8 .

(54)

then in the eq. (53) there is an ultra-violate (uv) divergence when x = y.
it could be regularized via point splitting. concisely this means that all
distances in the four-dimensional space-time must be bigger than some
regularization parameter . in this regularization scheme we get:

< tr(cid:16) f 2

lm(x) + ...(cid:17)  tr(cid:16) f 2

np(y) + ...(cid:17) >

terms.

(55)

n 2

(2 + |xm  ym|2)4 + contact

in conclusion, in the limit   0 we nd a perfect agreement between lhs
(53) and rhs (51) of (48) in this simplest situation. this check could be
extended also to another sym operators and sugra elds again with an
agreement [16]. furthermore, if  in not zero and if we equate it in lhs
and rhs of (48), then we nd that the ir regularization on the sugra
side is related to the uv one in the sym [7, 8]. moreover, it means that
the ads5  s5 sugra is related to the sym theory which lives on any
four-dimensional hyper-surface of the ads5 space. this hyper-surface is
just boundary shifted from z = 0 to regularize the sugra theory. while
its position with respect to the origin (r/ = r2
3/) is the energy
normalization scale for the sym [6]. in fact, one of the generators of the
so(5, 1) group acting on the sym theory changes its energy scale. on
the other hand, from the point of view of an observer in ads space this
group element shifts the ads boundary with respect to the origin [8].

 fourth, at this point one could ask the following question: what is the
meaning of the string theory for the n = 4 sym? in fact, for the ordinary
ym theory such a string description is expected to lead to the connement
phenomenon [1], but there is no connement in the n = 4 sym. fortu-
nately, using the ads/cft correspondence one can calculate the wilson

28

loop average in the sym theory [23, 22]. this calculation shows that we
get the coulombic rather than linear potential (which should be the case
for the connement to happen[1]) of the interaction between two heavy
particles in the fundamental representations [23, 22]. such an unusual
behavior is due to the ads geometry [24].

one could also give another arguments in favor of the validity of the ads/cft
correspondence [16]. but we stop here, since we hope that this is enough to con-
vince the reader that the ads/cft correspondence should be correct.

6 conclusions and acknowledgments

thus we see that the ads/cft correspondence gives the rst example of
string theory description of sym. it is worth mentioning that analogues of the
ads/cft correspondence could be established also for other dp-branes [25],
i.e. for sym theories in other dimensions. moreover, it could be generalized to
conformal ym theories with less number of susy [32, 33]

furthermore as is usual for such kind of statements, which relate two seem-
ingly unrelated theories, the correspondence is useful for both of its constituents
[16]. besides the fact that the correspondence suggests string description of
sym, it gives quantum description of gravity in terms of sym. we mean that
at scales much smaller than string one (when g2
ymn << 1) we have sym
description of quantum gravity: as we mentioned the ads sugra appears
as an eective theory for the sym. what is most interesting the ads/cft
correspondence represents an example of the holography in quantum gravity
[29, 30, 8, 31], since the sugra in the bulk of the target space described by the
sym theory dened on its boundary.

for integrity we would like to criticize the status of the whole subject. first,
we see that it is possible to nd a string description of ym theory only in the
most simplied situation.
in fact, the string description is found when ym
theory is maximally supersymmetric, when the large n limit is taken and it is
more or less testable only for the strong coupling g2
ymn  . second, even
in the latter situation the correspondence is not derived rigorously from rst
principles. this is the reason why we do not know whether superconformal
invariance is important or not for such a relation to happen (see [24, 27, 28]
for some attempts to deal with non-conformal situations). in another words, it
is not clear for us whether such a geometric picture persists for non-conformal
situations.

my understanding of the d-brane physics and of the ads/cft correspon-
dence was formed during discussions with anton gerasimov. i would like to
thank him for sharpening of my understanding of the subject. also i am in-
debted to n.hambli, m.laidlow, a.losev, j.maldacena, a.marshakov, a.morozov,

cussions. this work was done under the support of nserc nato fellowship

02-16575.

7 appendix (bps states)

in this appendix for completeness we dene what are the bps solitons. we
present here a standard simple exercise [11] which could, as we hope, help in
the understanding why bps solitons so special.

let us consider the two-dimensional scalar susy theory:

s = z d2(cid:20) 1

2

(a)2 +

i
2

  

1
2

v 2() 

1
2

v () (cid:21) ,

(56)

where  is a majorana fermion, and v () is an arbitrary function (it could

be v = (cid:0)2  2

under susy transformations with conserved neuther current:

0(cid:1) or v () = sin, for example). the theory is invariant

sa = (b) ba + iv ()a.

(57)

working with chiral components  of the fermi eld, the chiral components
q of the susy charge can be written as follows:

q = z d2 |(1  2)   v ()| .

in this notation the susy algebra is:

q2

+ = p+, q2

 = p, q+q + qq+ = z d22v ()


2
where p = p1  p2.

(58)

(59)

the rhs of the third equality here is the so called central charge z of the
susy algebra. it is proportional to the topological charge in the theory. in
fact, for example, if v () = sin, then z = r +
(2cos). the latter
is non-zero only for (anti-) kink solutions. from the algebra (59) one could nd:

 d2

2



p+ + p = z + (q+  q)2 = z + (q+ + q)2 ,

(60)
hence, p+ + p  |z|. for a single particle state with mass m at rest this
implies

p = p+ = m 

1
2|z|.

(61)

this bound is saturated for the bps states, when as seen from (60) (q+ + q)
|bp s >= 0 or (q+  q)|bp s >= 0. for example, this condition satised

30

for all kink and anti-kink solutions of this theory. thus, the bps sates compose
small representations of the susy algebra: some combination of supercharges
acts trivially on the state, and hence does not generate superpartners [15].

the last feature of the bps states is crucial. in fact, if the susy is not
broken (which could be checked from the beginning by calculation of the witten
index for the theory), adiabatic variations of the parameters of the theory do
not change representations of the susy algebra. hence, if the equality (61)
holds at some values of the parameters, then it holds always and bps states
survive quantum corrections. moreover one could control the renormalization
of the mass and charge using the equality in the eq. (61), and if there is enough
susy neither of them is renormalized at all.
