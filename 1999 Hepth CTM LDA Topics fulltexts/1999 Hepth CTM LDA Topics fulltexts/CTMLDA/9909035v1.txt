we rederive the nonrelativistic lagrangian for the low energy dynamics of 1/4 bps

dyons by considering the time dependent uctuations around classical 1/4 bps con-

gurations. the relevant uctuations are the zero modes of the underlying 1/2 bps

monopoles.

recently the 1/4 bps dyonic congurations are constructed and their nature has been ex-
ploited in the n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theories [1, 2, 3, 4]. since the supersymmetric
yang-mills theories arise as a low energy description of parallel d3 branes in the type iib string
theory [5], the quantum 1/4 bps states have the string interpretation as multi-pronged string [6].
in the classical eld theory, the 1/4 bps congurations can be viewed as a collection of 1/2 bps
dyons positioned with respect to each other so that a balance of the coulomb and higgs forces is
achieved. the bps equations satised by the classical 1/4 bps congurations consist of the 1/2
bps monopole equation and its gauge zero mode equation. the underlying 1/2 bps congurations
are uniquely determined by the moduli coordinates, which in turn determine the solution of the
second bps equation uniquely [1].

the low energy dynamics of 1/4 bps monopoles has been explored in ref. [7] and it is shown
that a specic potential is required in addition to the kinetic terms over the moduli space. the basic
ideas of the construction were as follows. in the limit where 1/4 bps congurations are almost 1/2
bps, it should be possible to rediscover the physics of 1/4 bps congurations from the zero mode
dynamics of 1/2 bps congurations. since static forces exist between 1/2 bps solitons in the case
of misaligned vacua [8], the simplest possibility is to add a potential term to the moduli space
dynamics. the potential is indeed uniquely determined from the given knowledge of the electric
charge and mass of the 1/4 bps states. here the result by tong was particularly useful [9]. the low
energy lagrangian has a bps bound and its bps conguration corresponds to the 1/4 bps eld
conguration [7]. for a simple case, quantum 1/4 bps states of the corresponding supersymmetric
lagrangian have been found in ref. [10].

however, the derivation of the low energy dynamics was in some sense indirect. even though
the presence of the potential is obvious by considering the interaction between point particle dyons,
the exact structure of the potential cannot be obtained from the particle point of view. in this note,
we rederive the low energy lagrangian for 1/4 bps congurations by the eld theoretic method.
the dynamical variables are the zero modes, or the moduli of the underling 1/2 bps congurations.

we begin with the n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory. we choose the compact
semisimple group g of the rank r. among the six higgs elds, only two higgs elds a, b play the
role in the bps bound. the bosonic part of the lagrangian is given by

l =

1

2 z d3x trne2  b2 + (d0a)2  (da)2 + (d0b)2  (db)2  (i[a, b])2o ,

(1)

where d0 = (0  ia0), d =   ia, and e = 0a  da0. the four vector potential (a0, a) =
0t a, aat a) and the group generators t a are traceless hermitian matrices such that tr t at b = ab.
(aa

as shown in ref. [1], there is a bps bound on the energy functional, which is saturated when

congurations satisfy

together with the gauss law,

b = db ,
e = da ,
d0b  i[a, b] = 0 ,
d0a = 0 ,

d  e  i[b, d0b]  i[a, d0a] = 0 .

equation (2) is the old bps equation for 1/2 bps monopoles and is called the primary bps
equation. equations (3), (4), (5), and (6) can be put together into a single equation,

d2a  [b, [b, a]] = 0,

(7)

which is called the secondary bps equation. this equation is the global gauge zero mode equation
for the rst bps equation. we can choose the gauge where a0 = a, in which case the conguration
itself becomes static in time.

in the asymptotic region, two higgs elds take the form

b  b  h 

a  a  h 

g  h
4r
q  h

(9)

where h is the cartan subalgebra. we are interested in the case where the expectation value b
breaks the gauge group g maximally to abelian subgroups u (1)r. then, there exists a unique set
of simple roots 1, 2, ..., r such that   b > 0 [11]. the magnetic and electric charges are given
by

r

g = 4

r

q =

x=1

n,

x=1
q,

(10)

(11)

where integer n  0. any solution to these bps equations possesses a mass that saturates the
bps bound

m = z = b  g + a  q,

(12)

where z is the larger one out of two central charges in the n = 4 supersymmetric theory.

the solutions of the primary bps equation describe the collection of 1/2 bps monopoles. for
each simple root, there exists a fundamental monopole of four zero modes. the integer n denotes
the number of the  fundamental monopoles. we consider the case where all n are positive so
that the monopoles do not separate into mutually noninteracting subgroups. the moduli space

of the 1/2 bps conguration has the dimension of the number of zero modes, 4p n. with
the moduli space coordinates zm , the zero modes are a linear combination of moduli coordinate
dependence and a local gauge transformation. with a simple pseudo four dimensional vector
a(x, zm ) = (a, b) with  = 1, 2, 3, 4, the zero modes will be

m a =

a
zm + dm ,

(13)

where dm = m  i[a, m ] with understanding 4 = 0. the zero mode equations for the
primary bps equation are

  m a = m b  i[m a, b],
dm a = 0,

(14)
(15)

where the second equation is the background eld gauge xing condition. from the eld theory,
there is well dened metric on the moduli space [12, 13, 14],

gm n (z) = z d3x trm an a.

(16)

the low energy dynamics of 1/2 bps congurations is given by the nonrelativistic lagrangian

l1/2 =

1
2

gm n (z) zm zn .

(17)

as there are r unbroken global u (1) symmetries, the corresponding electric charges should
be conserved. in another word, l1/2 should have r cyclic coordinates corresponding to these gauge
transformations. for each  u (1) symmetry the corresponding cyclic coordinate is denoted by 
with  = 1, ..., r. expanding the asymptotic value a = p a, where s are the fundamental
weights such that    = , we notice da is the gauge zero mode

where

da = ak m

is the killing vector for the  u (1) symmetry. if we divide the moduli coordinates zm to  and
the rest yi, the lagrangian (17) can be rewritten as

l1/2 =

hij(y) yi yj +

l(y)(  + w

i = lgi. notice that all metric components are

let us now explore the low energy dynamics of 1/4 bps congurations. the idea is to
calculate the eld theoretic lagrangian for a suitable initial condition in the eld theory. it needs
to specify the elds and their time derivatives or their momenta. clearly we require the initial
condition to be given by a 1/4 bps conguration when there is no real time evolution. as the
momentum variables e and d0b are nonzero for 1/4 bps congurations, nontrivial time evolution
will ensue only if we add additional eld momenta or time derivatives to the 1/4 bps conguration.

the moduli space dynamics of 1/2 bps congurations is correct when the kinetic energy is
much smaller than the rest mass. this means the order of the velocities, v  zm is much smaller
than 1. for 1/4 bps congurations, there is a natural scale   |a|/|b|. we will see that the limit
 << 1 is the suitable region for the low energy dynamics.

thus, let us put the initial condition to be a(x, yi), b(x, yi), a(x, yi) and the momentum
variables, da + zm m a, i[a, b] + zm m b, and zm m a. here we have replaced the zeroth order
momentum variables with the eld variables by using the 1/4 bps equations. we also choose the
gauge a0 = a. m a cannot be dened by the zero mode equation of the secondary bps equation.
otherwise the asymptotic form (9) implies nonzero contribution from 0q(z) to 0a. the 1/4 bps
condition involves the eld momenta and we cannot include the additional eld momenta at a given
point of the moduli space, maintaining the 1/4 bps equations. rather we choose zm m a to be
an unspecied quantity of order v, whose exact nature, as we will see soon, is irrelevant for the
low energy dynamics. as m a and m b satisfy the background gauge, the gauss law is satised
for the initial condition to order v. there is a correction of order 2v due to the a eld, but it is
negligible to the order we are working on.

let us now calculate the lagrangian (1) for this initial condition. it becomes

l = b  g +

1

2 z d3x trn( zm m a)2o + z d3x tr n zm m a  da + zm m b i[a, b]o ,

(21)

where the rst order in velocity terms appear as there were nonzero eld momenta for the 1/4 bps
congurations. here again we used 1/4 bps equations to replace the momenta with the elds.
this lagrangian is of order v2 or v. we have neglected the terms of order v22, which comes from
the kinetic energy of a eld. the terms linear in zm can be rewritten as a boundary contribution
by using the background gauge condition,

zm z d3x tr {m a  da + m b i[a, b]} = zm z d3x   tr (am a).

(22)

noticing that da and i[a, b] are a global gauge zero mode, ak m
relativistic lagrangian as

 m a, we can rewrite the non-

(23)

(24)

(25)

where b  g is omitted.

l1 =

1
2

gm n zm zn + gm n zm ak n


let us introduce new moduli coordinates { m } = yi,  such that

 =  + at.

since this transformation shifts only cyclic coordinates, the above lagrangian becomes

l1/4 =

1
2

gm n ()  m  n 

1
2

gm n ()ak m

 ak n
 .

the kinetic term of this lagrangian is the low energy lagrangian (17) for 1/2 bps congurations
and there is an additional potential. in terms of the yi,  variables,

l1/4 =

1
2

hij(y) yi yj +

1
2

l(y)(  + w

i (y) yi)(  + w

j (y) yj) 

1
2

l(y)aa.

(26)

this is exactly the low energy lagrangian obtained in ref. [7].

there is a couple of more points to be discussed. the exact 1/4 bps conguration is static
in yi and  coordinates, so that  = at + constant term. the velocity of  coordinates is of
order , which is all right as v and  can be of the same order. when we dene the hamiltonian,
the zm coordinates are not appropriate. again from the eld theory, the energy function we have
has the contribution from the momentum variables. in terms of zm variables, the eld theoretic
energy functional for our initial condition becomes

in terms of the { m } = {yi, } variables, this energy becomes

e = b  q + a  q + l1.

where e1/4 is the energy corresponding to the lagrangian (25),

e = b  q + e1/4,

e1/4 =

1

gm n ()  m  n +

gm n ()ak m

 ak n
 .

here we have used the tong formula

a  q = gm n ()ak m

 ak n
 .

the energy e1/4 has a bps bound, which is saturated when zm = 0 or  m = ak m
 , and has the
value of the electric mass a  q. this nonrelativistic bps conguration describes the eld theoretic
1/4 bps congurations. thus, a consistent picture of the moduli space has been emerged.

as shown in the ref. [7], the above lagrangian can be generalized to supersymmetric case
so that it describes 1/4 bps dyons in the n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory. there exists
naturally quantum bps bound on this supersymmetric lagrangian. in ref. [10], the quantum 1/4
bps states are found by solving the quantum bps conditions on the wave functions for the case
of the su (3) group.
