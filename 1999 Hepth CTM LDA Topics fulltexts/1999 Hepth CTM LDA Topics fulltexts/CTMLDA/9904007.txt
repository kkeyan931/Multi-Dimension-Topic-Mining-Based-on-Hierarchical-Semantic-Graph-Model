(3) note form dictated corresponding twisted tadpole cancellation conditions . massless spectrum open string sector model consists gauge vector supermultiplets u(8) so(16) well corresponding charged hypermultiplets transforming irreps (28, 1) (8, 16) gauge group. note spectrum satises gravitational anomaly cancellation condition  nh nv = 273 29nt , (4) number tensor multiplets nt = 10, number hypermultiplets nh = 167 (11 arise closed string sector, 156 come open string sector), number vector multiplets (all come open string sector) nv = 184. model possess perturbative heterotic dual contains extra tensor multiplets. reason appearance orientifold projection chosen j . hand, chosen orientifold projection (after appropriate blow-ups) , would obtained vacuum extra tensor multiplets closed string sector. if, however, choose chan-paton matrices (which 99 sector would lead massless spectrum), would obtain anomalous model condition (4) satised. signals naive orientifold (that is, world-sheet) approach case misses states whose existence dictated anomaly cancellation conditions. 1throughout paper work 16 16 (rather 32 32) chan-paton matrices choose count orientifold images corresponding d-branes. 4 fortunately, case actually understand origin missing states using type i-heterotic duality. point orientifold type iib (appropriately blown up) orbifold 4/z3 type compactied space. latter dual perturbative heterotic compactication d5-branes case. fact, identify corresponding heterotic vacuum 4/z3 compactication gauge bundle dened orbifold action spin(32)/z2 degrees freedom given matrices {w1, w, w1} {1, , 1}. 16 16 w-matrices act spin(32)/z2 momentum states corresponding rotations. (alternatively, describe action terms corresponding shifts spin(32)/z2 momentum lattice.) resulting heterotic model perturbatively well dened (that is, satises corresponding consistency requirements modular invariance). untwisted sector model contains n = 1 supergravity multiplet, one tensor multiplet 2 neutral hypermultiplets (these states mapped untwisted closed string sector dual type vacuum); also contains gauge vector supermultiplets u(8) so(16) well corresponding charged hypermultiplets transforming irreps (28, 1) (8, 16) gauge group (these states mapped untwisted open string sector dual type vacuum described above). twisted sector heterotic model contains 18 hypermultiplets (neutral non-abelian subgroups fractionally2 charged u(1) subgroup) plus 9 additional hypermultiplets transforming irrep (28, 1) u(8) so(16) (these states also fractionally charged u(1) subgroup). 18 hypermultiplets correspond orbifold blow-up modes, mapped twisted closed string sector hypermultiplets type side. note 9 twisted hypermultiplets (on heterotic side) charged su(8) subgroup match orientifold picture. is, non-perturbative orientifold viewpoint. nonetheless, must exist corresponding type model. fact, precisely states required satisfy anomaly cancellation condition (4). states (which charged 99 gauge group) thought arising z3 twisted 99 sector. type i-heterotic duality tool allows us understand states (by perturbative heterotic calculation) possess world-sheet description orientifold language. later convenience give massless spectrum z3 model table i. let us go back z6 model dened beginning section. since z3 model orientifold projection choice gauge bundle (3) consistent, z6 model also consistent long make sure corresponding z2 model consistent. is, must choose action z2 twist chan-paton factors appropriately. 2these charges fractional normalization (which conventional discussing ori- entifold models) fundamental su (8) charge +1 corresponding u (1) subgroup. following omit u (1) charges generically fractional twisted open string sectors. certain cases one determine charges using type i-heterotic duality (as heterotic side charges computed corresponding twisted sectors). nonetheless, choose various subtleties involved computations might obscured main point paper. 5 consistent solution chan-paton matrices z2 model given . thus, consider type iib m2 = 4/z2 (with trivial ns-ns b-eld), generator r z2 reects complex coordinates z1, z2 4: rz1,2 = z1,2. next, consider orientifold theory. closed string sector contains (along corresponding n = 1 supergravity multiplet) one tensor multiplet 20 hypermultiplets (4 come untwisted sector, 16 come z2 twisted sector). open string sector 32 d9-branes plus 32 d5-branes. let d5-branes sit top orientifold 5-plane located origin orbifold. twisted d9- d5-brane chan-paton matrices 9,r 9,r given 9,r = 5,r = diag(ii8, ii8) . (5) massless spectrum open string sector consists gauge vector supermultiplets u(16)99 u(16)55 well corresponding charged hypermultiplets transforming irreps 2 (120; 1) (99 sector), 2 (1; 120) (55 sector), (16; 16) (59 sector). spectrum summarized table i, seen satisfy anomaly cancellation condition (4). untwisted 99, 55 59 sector matter content full z6 model z6 model . particular, orbifold action chan-paton charges given corresponding twisted chan-paton matrices (which identical d9- d5-branes present setup): 9, = 5, = diag(i4, 1i4, i8) , 9,r = 5,r = diag(ii2, ii2, ii2, ii2, ii4, ii4) . (6) (7) = g2 r = g3 (g generator z6 orbifold group). thus, gauge group 99 99 sector. since placed d5-branes top orientifold 5-plane located origin, 55 sector gauge group 55 99 sector. matter content untwisted 99, 55 59 sectors (these sectors perturbative orientifold viewpoint) given table i. ready determine twisted 99, 55 59 sector matter content full z6 model. twisted 99 sector states straightforward determine. already discussed matter arising twisted 99 sector z3 model. obtain corresponding states z6 model must project onto z2 invariant states. note original 9 xed points organized 5 linear combinations invariant z2 twist plus 4 linear combinations pick minus sign z2 twist. thus, taking account z2 action xed points chan-paton charges, twisted 99 sector 5 copies hypermultiplets irreps (6, 1, 1)99 (1, 6, 1)99, also 4 copies hypermultiplets irrep (4, 4, 1)99. twisted 55 sector bit subtle. since placed d5-branes origin (which xed point z3 z2 twists), follows one copy hypermultiplets irreps (6, 1, 1)55 (1, 6, 1)55. (no hypermultiplets irrep (4, 4, 1)55 appear origin invariant z2 twist.) particular, 8 original 9 xed points z3 twist play role discussion twisted 55 states arise due local geometry near origin. 6 finally, twisted 59 sector contains one copy hypermultiplets irreps (4, 1, 1; 4, 1, 1)59 (1, 4, 1; 1, 4, 1)59. multiplicity states follows consid- erations similar 55 sector. gauge charges, dictated

sectors arise via straightforward orbifold reduction corresponding (so(32)) gauge theory (with n = 2 supersymmetry six dimensions). thus, z2 orbifold model  perturbative orientifold viewpoint, non-perturbative heterotic language. contrast, z3 model table perturbative heterotic viewpoint, perturbative orientifold description. z6 model non-perturbative orientifold heterotic pictures. point z4 case projection (instead j projection ) appear tractable approach action z4 twist chan-paton charges case correspond perturbative gauge bundle heterotic side. thus, understand z4 case one would need dierent approach. would like end section following comment. following  could attempt construct similar non-perturbative orientifolds non-trivial ns-ns b-eld turned on. unfortunately, however, would lose control non-perturbative (twisted) states. thus, instance, z3 model non-zero ns-ns b-eld rank 2 appear perturbative heterotic dual. nonetheless, next section see four dimensions one nd cases non-zero ns-ns b-eld understood within present approach. iii. four dimensional examples section extend discussion previous section obtain non- perturbative orientifolds n = 1 supersymmetry four

z2 = z2 , (8) (9) exp(2i/3). theory n = 2 supersymmetry four dimensions. next, consider orientifold theory. acts smooth calabi-yau case. this, particular, implies must rst appropriately blow (some of) orbifold singularities orientifolding. orientifolding closed string sector contains n = 1 supergravity multiplet, dilaton plus axion supermultiplet, also 46 chiral supermultiplets. particular, 4 7 arise untwisted sector, 18 come z3 twisted sector, z2 z6 sectors contribute 12 chiral supermultiplets. open string sector, 32 d9-branes 32 d5-branes. required untwisted tadpole cancellation

dened perturbative description) obtained . however,  pointed also twisted 99, 55 59 sector contributions one must take account. clear discussion previous section. fact, following approach used constructing six dimensional z6 model previous section, also obtain massless states twisted open string sectors four dimensional z 6 model well. since discussion four dimensional case parallels quite closely six dimensional example, simply summarize massless spectrum z 6 model table ii. let us, however, mention multiplicity 3 twisted 55 59 sectors due fact 3 xed points z3 direction d5-branes wrap. hand, original 9 xed points relevant discussion twisted 99 sector decompose 6 linear combinations invariant z2 twist plus 3 linear combinations pick minus sign z2 twist. orbifold action chan-paton

supersymmetric string vacuum non-perturbative orientifold heterotic viewpoints. spectrum model seen free non-abelian gauge anomalies, cancellation case non-trivial. particular, untwisted open string sectors alone produce anomaly free spectrum. twisted sector contributions also anomaly free. naive (that is, perturbative) tadpole cancellation conditions orientifold give rise anomaly free model. nonetheless, imply spectrum obtained via orientifold techniques complete. fact, non-perturbative (that is, twisted) sector contributions non-trivial, must taken account. end section, would like discuss similar model non-trivial ns-ns b-eld turned on. thus, consider z 6 orbifold model presence non-zero ns-ns b-eld z1 direction3. thus, let 6 = 2 4, two-torus 2 parametrized complex coordinate
