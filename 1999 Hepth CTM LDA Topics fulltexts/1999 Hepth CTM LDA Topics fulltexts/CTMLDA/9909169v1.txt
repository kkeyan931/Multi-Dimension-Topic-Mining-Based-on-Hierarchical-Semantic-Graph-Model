abstract

one of us got spins and charges of not only scalars and vectors but also of
spinors out of elds, which are antisymmetric tensor elds. kahler got spins
of spinors out of dierential forms, which again are antisymmetric tensor elds.
using our simple grassmann formulation of spins and charges of either spinors
or vectors and comparing it to the dirac-kahler formulation of spinors, we gen-
eralize the dirac-kahler approach to vector internal degrees of freedom and to
charges of either spinors or vectors and tenzors and point out how at all spinors
can appear in both approaches.

introduction.

kahler[1] has shown how to use dierential forms to describe the spin of fermions.
one of us[2] has shown how a space of anticommuting coordinates can be used
to describe spins and charges of not only fermions but also of bosons, unifying
spins and charges for either fermions or for bosons.
in the present talk we point out the analogy and nice relations between the two

dierent ways of achieving the appearance of spin one half degrees of freedom
when starting from pure vectors and tensors. we comment the necessity of
appearance of four copies of dirac fermions in both approaches.
comparing carefully the two approaches we generalize the kahler approach to
describe also integer spins as well as charges for either spinors or vectors, unifying
spins and charges.

2 dirac equations in grassmann space.

what we call quantum mechanics in grassmann space[2] is the model for going
beyond the standard model with extra dimensions of ordinary and anticommut-
ing coordinates, describing spins and charges of either fermions or bosons in an
unique way.
in a d-dimensional space-time the internal degrees of freedom of either spinors
or vectors and scalars come from the odd grassmannian variables a,
a 
{0, 1, 2, 3, 5, , d}.
we write wave functions describing either spinors or vectors in the form

(a) = xi=0,1,..,3,5,..,d

{a1<a2<...<ai}{0,1,..,3,5,..,d}

x

a1,a2,...,aia1 a2    ai,

(1)

where the coecients a1,a2,...,ai depend on commuting coordinates xa, a 
{0, 1, 2, 3, 5, .., d}. the wave function space spanned over grassmannian coor-
dinate space has the dimension 2d. completely analogously to usual quantum
mechanics we have the operator for the conjugate variable a to be

p
a = i


 a.

(2)

the rihgt arrow tells, that the derivation has to be performed from the left hand
side. these operators then obey the odd heisenberg algebra, which written by
means of the generalized commutators

{a, b} := ab  (1)nab ba,

where

nab = ( +1,

if a and b have grassmann odd character
otherwise,

0,

takes the form

{pa, pb} = 0 = {a, b},

{pa, b} = iab.

(3)

(4)

(5)

2

here ab is the at metric  = diag{1, 1, 1, ...}.
we may dene the operators

aa := i(pa  ia),

aa := (pa + ia),

(6)

for which we can show that the aas among themselves fulll the cliord algebra
as do also the aas, while they mutually anticommute:

{aa, ab} = 2ab = {aa, ab},

{aa, ab} = 0.

we could recognize formally

either

aapa| >= 0,

or

aapa| >= 0

(7)

(8)

as the dirac-like equation, because of the above generalized commutation rela-
tions. applying either the operator aapa or aapa on the two equations we get the
klein-gordon equation papa| >= 0, where we dene pa = i 
one can, however, check that none of the two equations (8) have solutions which
would transform as spinors with respect to the the generators for the lorentz
transformations, when taken in analogy with the generators of the lorentz trans-
formations in ordinary space (lab = xapb  xbpa)

xa .

sab := apb  bpa.

we can write, however, these generators as the sum

sab = sab + sab,

sab := 

[aa, ab],

sab := 

i
4

[aa, ab],

i
4

(9)

(10)

whith [a, b] := ab  ba and recognize that the solutions of the two equations
(8) now transform as spinors with respect to either sab or sab.
one also can easily see that the untilded, the single tilded and the double
tilded sab obey the d-dimensional lorentz generator algebra {m ab, m cd} =
i(m adbc + m bcad  m acbd  m bdac), when inserted for m ab.
we shall present this approach in more details in section 4 when pointing out
the similarities between this approach and the kahler approach and generalizing
the kahler approach.

3 kahler formulation of spinors.

kahler formulates[1] spinors in terms of wave functions which are superpositions
of the p-forms in the d = 4 - dimensional space. the 0-forms are scalars, the
1-forms are dened as dual vectors to the (local) tangent spaces, the higher

3

p-forms are dened as antisymmetrized cartesian (exterior) products of the one-
form spaces. a general linear combination of forms is then written

u = u0 + u1 + ... + ud,

up = xi1<i2...<ip

ai1i2...ip dxi1  dxi2  dxi3      dxip . (11)

one can dene the exterior product  and the cliord product  among the
forms. the exterior product has the property of making the product of a p-form
and a q-form to be a (p+q)-form, if a p-form and a q-form have no common
dierentials. the cliord product dxa on a p-form is either a p + 1 form, if a
p-form does not include a one form dxa, or a p  1 form, if a one form dxa is
included in a p-form.
kahler found how the dirac equation could be written as an equation[1] ( eq.
(26.6) in the kahlers paper)

 iu = m  u, with u =

dxi 

u
xi  dt 

u
t

.

(12)

3

xi=1

with u dened in eq.(11). the symbol  denotes the inner dierentiation, a 
{0, 1, 2, 3} and m means the electron mass.
for a free massless particle living in a d dimensional space-time eq.(12) can be
rewritten in the form

dxa  pa u = 0,

a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., d.

(13)

the wave function describing the state of the spin one half particle is packed into
the exterior algebra function u.

4 parallelism between the two approaches.

we demonstrate the parallelism between the kahler[1] and the one of us[2] ap-
proach in steps, rst paying attention on spin 1
2 only, as kahler did. using simple
and transparent denitions of the exterior and interior product in grassmann
space, we generalize the kahler approach rst by dening the two kinds of 
(eq.(12)) operators on the space of p-forms and accordingly three kinds of the
generators of the lorentz transformations, two of the spinorial and one of the
vectorial character. we try to put clearly forward how the spinorial degrees of
freedom emerge out of vector objects like the 1-forms or as. we then generalize
the p-forms to describe not only spins but also charges of spin 1
2 and spin 0 and
1 objects, unifying also in the space of forms spins and charges.

4.1 dirac-kahler equation and dirac equation in grass-
mann space for massless particles.

we present here, side by side, the operators in the space of dierential forms and
in grassmann space: the exterior product

dxa  dxb     ,

ab    ,

the operator of dierentiation

 i ea,

pa = i

a




= i



a

,

and the two superpositions

dxa  := dxa  + ea,
dxa  := i (dxa   ea),

aa := i (pa  ia),
aa := (pa + ia).

(14)

(15)

(16)

the superposition with the signis the one used by kahler (eqs.(12).
one easily nds (see eqs.(6,7)) the commutation relations, understood in the
generalized way of eq.(3)

{dxa , dxb } = 2ab,
{dxa , dxb } = 2ab,

{aa, ab} = 2ab,
{aa, ab} = 2ab.

(17)

since {ea, dxb } = ab and {ea, eb} = 0 = {dxa , dxb }, while {ipa, b} =
ab and {pa, pb} = 0 = {a, b}, it is obvious that ea plays in the p-form
formalism the role of the derivative with respect to a dierential 1form, similarly
as ipa does with respect to a grassmann coordinate.
we nd for both approaches the dirac-like equations:

dxa  pa u = 0,

dxa  pa u = 0,

aa pa (a) = 0,
aa pa (a) = 0.

(18)

taking into account the above denitions it follows that

dxa  pa dxb  pb u = pa pa u = 0,

aa pa ab pb (b) = pa pa (b) = 0.

(19)
we see that either dxa  pa u = 0 or dxa  pa u = 0, similarly as either
aa pa (a) = 0 or aa pa (a) = 0 can represent the dirac-like equation.
both, dxa  and dxa  dene the algebra of the a matrices and so do both aa
and aa. one would thus be tempted to identify

a
naive := dxa ,

or

a
naive := aa.

(20)

5

but there is a large freedom in dening what to identify with the gamma-
matrices, because except when using 0 as a parity operation, one has an even
number of gamma matrices occuring in the physical applications such as con-
struction of currents a or for the lorentz generators on spinors i
4 [a, b].
then all the gamma matrices can be multiplied by some factor provided it does
disturb neither their algebra nor their even products. this freedom might be
used to solve, what seems a problem:
having an odd grassmann character, neither aa nor aa and similarly neither
dxa  nor dxa  should be recognized as the dirac a operators, since they would
change, when operating on polynomials of a or on superpositions of p-form ob-
jects of an odd grassmann character to objects of an even grassmann character.
one would, however, expect - since grassmann odd elds second quantize to
fermions, while grassmann even elds second quantize to bosons - that the a
operators do not change the grassmann character of the wave functions so that
the canonical quantization of grassmann odd elds then automatically assures
the anticommuting relations between the operators of the fermionic elds.
we may propose that accordingly

either

a := i dx0  dxa ,

or

a = i a0 aa

(21)

are recognized as the dirac a operators operating on the space of p-forms or
polynomyals of as, respectively, since they both have an even grassmann char-
acter and they both full the cliord algebra {a, b} = 2ab. ( the role ofand
can in either the kahler case or the case of polynomials in grassmann space, be
exchanged. )
the two denitions of gamma-matrices ((21), (20)) make only a dierence when
0-matrix is used alone. this 0-matrix has to simulate the parity reection
which is

either

~dx   ~dx,

or

~  ~.

(22)

the ugly gamma-matrix identications (21) indeed perform this operation.
kahler did not connect eveness and oddness of the forms with the statistics. he
used the naive gamma-matrix identications (20). the same can be said for
the becher-joos ([3]) paper.

4.2 generators of lorentz transformations.

we are presenting the generators of the lorentz transformations of spinors for
both approaches

m ab = lab + s ab,

lab = xapb  xbpa.

(23)

the two approaches dier in the denition of the generators of the lorentz trans-
formations in the internal space s ab. while kahler suggested the denition for

6

spin 1

2 particles

s ab = dxa  dxb, s abu =

1
2

((dxa  dxb)  u  u  (dxa  dxb)),

(24)

in the grassmann case[2] the two kinds of the operators s ab for spinors can be
dened, presented in eqs.(10), with the properties

[ sab, ac] = i(acab  bcaa),

[ sab, ac] = 0 = [s ab, ac].
(25)
following the approach in grassmann space one can also in the kahler case dene
two kinds of the lorentz generators for spinors, which (both) simplify eq.(24)

[s ab, ac] = i(acab  bcaa),

s ab = 

i
4

[dxa  + ea, dxb  + eb],

s ab =

i
4
i
s ab = 
4

[dxa   ea, dxb   eb],

[a, b].

(26)

the above denition enables us to dene also in the kahler case the generators
of the lorentz transformations of the vectorial character

s ab = sab + sab = i(dxa eb dxb ea), s ab = sab + s ab = apb bpa. (27)

the operator s ab = i(dxa  eb  dxb  ea), being applied on dierential p-forms,
transforms vectors into vectors.

4.3
four copies of weyl bi-spinors in kahler or in
approach in grassmann space and vector representa-
tions.

4!

in the case of d = 4 one may arrange the space of 2d vectors into four copies of
two weyl spinors, one left ( < (4) >= 1, (4) = i (2i)2
abcds abs cd ) and one
right ( < (4) >= 1) handed (we have made a choice of  ), in such a way that
they are at the same time the eigen vectors of the operators s12 and the s03 and
have either an odd or an even grassmann character. these vectors are in the
kahler approach the superpositions of p-forms and in the one of us[2] approach
the polynomials of ms, m  (0, 1, 2, 3). the two weyl vectors of one copy of
the weyl bi-spinors are connected by the m (eq.(21)) operators.
analysing the irreducible representations of the group so(1, 3) with respect to
the generator of the lorentz transformations of the vectorial type[2] (eqs.( 27))
one nds for d = 4 two scalars ( a scalar and a pseudo scalar), two three vectors
(in the su (2)  su (2) representation of so(1, 3) denoted by (1, 0) and (0, 1)
representation, respectively, with < (4) = 1 >) and two four vectors.

7

4.4 generalization to extra dimensions.

it has been suggested[2] that the lorentz transformations in the space of as
in d  4 dimensions manifest themselves as generators for charges observable at
the end for the four dimensional particles. since both the extra dimension spin
degrees of freedom and the ordinary spin degrees of freedom originate from the
as or the forms we have a unication of these internal degrees of freedom.
let us take as an example the model[2] which has d = 14 and at rst - at the
high energy level - so(1, 13) lorentz group, but which should be broken ( in two
steps ) to rst so(1, 7)  so(6) and then to so(1, 3)  su (3)  su (2).

5 appearance of spinors.

one of course wonders about how it is at all possible that the dirac equation
appears for a spinor eld out of models with only scalar, vector and tensor
objects! it only can be done by exchanging the lorentz generators s ab by the sab
say ( or the sab if we choose them instead), see equations (10, 26). this indeed
means that one of the two kinds of operators fullling the cliord algebra and
anticommuting with the other kind - it has been made a choice of dxa  in the
kahler case and aa in the approach of one of us - are put to zero in the operators
of lorentz transformations; as well as in all the operators representing physical
quantities. the use of dx0  or a0 in the operator 0 is the exception only used
to simulate the grassmann even parity operation ~dx
and ~  ~,
respectively.
in ([2]) the aas are argued away on the ground of the action.
