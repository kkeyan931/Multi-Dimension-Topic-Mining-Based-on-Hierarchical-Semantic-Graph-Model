abstract

nonsingularity conditions are established for the bfv gauge-xing
fermion which are sucient for it to lead to the correct path integral for
a theory with constraints canonically quantized in the bfv approach.
the conditions ensure that anticommutator of this fermion with the
brst charge regularises the path integral by regularising the trace
over non-physical states in each ghost sector. the results are applied
to the quantization of a system which has a gribov problem, using a
non-standard form of the gauge-xing fermion.

1 introduction

this paper investigates the fradkin-vilkovisky theorem, which establishes
the validity of the path-integral expression used in canonical brst quan-
tization according to the bfv scheme, particularly addressing the question
of gauge-xing. the main idea is to show that the path integral gives a
trace over physical states, with the gauge-xing term regularising the trace
on the non-physical states by ensuring that these terms cancel out, using the
relation between supertrace and cohomology.

it has long been recognised that in the quantization of gauge systems some
mechanism is required for the cancellation of redundancy arising from gauge
equivalence. the standard method uses a lagrangian modied by gauge-
xing and faddeev-popov ghost terms, which contribute to the path integral
a factor which nicely divides out the gauge redundancy. the faddeev-popov
method was extended by batalin, fradkin, fradkina and vilkovisky in a se-
ries of papers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to allow relativistic gauge xing. (the method

1

developed in these papers will be referred to as the bfv approach.) hen-
neaux subsequently gave an interpretation of the bfv approach in terms of
brst cohomology [6]. there is a detailed account of these ideas in the book
of henneaux and teitelboim [7].

the central idea of these methods is that the original hamiltonian hc
must be adjusted by a term i[, ] where  is the brst charge of the theory
 is the gauge xing fermion and [, ] is the super commutator  + .
however exactly which class of gauge-xing fermions leads to correct results
has not been entirely clear, as is demonstrated by the interesting work of
govaerts [8] and govaerts and troost [9]. the main result of this paper is
to establish the precise conditions which the gauge xing fermion  must
satisfy if the procedure is to give the correct result. these conditions (which
will be referred to as the nonsingularity conditions) are given fully in section
3, together with a proof of the main result. two examples are given of the
use of this theorem; one is the simple example of a system with translational
invariance in one direction, the corresponding constraint being that the com-
ponent of momentum in this direction is zero. in this case well-known results
are recovered. the second is an example where a gribov ambiguity might
be expected to prevent application of any technique involving gauge-xing;
it is shown that in fact a gauge xing fermion can be chosen so that the the
bfv formalism is valid.

the proof of the main result depends on the fact (pointed out by schwarz
[10]) that the supertrace (or, in the terminology of schwarz paper, the lef-
schetz trace)of a brst-invariant operator is equal to the alternating sum of
the traces of this operator on cohomology classes. this is precisely the trace
over physical states if the only non-trivial brst cohomology is at ghost num-
ber zero. then, provided it can be shown that the path integral expression
for the vacuum generating function does give the supertrace of the evolution
operator, the theorem is established. however, since even in the quantum-
mechanical setting taking a trace involves innite sums, care must be taken
that operators have well-dened traces. it will be shown that the operator
exp [i[, ]t], which is equal to the identity operator on the space of physical
states, regularises the trace on the non-physical states in such a way that
contributions from these states cancel out.

the paper begins with a brief description of the quantization method set
up by bfv and extended by henneaux. a simple but important lemma is
then proved, which establishes that the rst nonsingularity condition ensures
that the only states with non-trivial brst cohomology have ghost number

2

zero. a study of the eigenstates and eigenvalues of exp(i[, ]t) is then used
to show (by arguments similar to those of mckean and singer [11]) that
the path integral dened by the extended hamiltonian ht + i[, ] gives
the correct generating functional. (here ht is a brst-invariant extension of
the original hamiltonian hc.) the main result is then applied to two specic
systems; the second of these has a gribov problem [12] which makes standard
gauge-xing methods unworkable but can be handled by the methods of this
paper. the diculties of gauge-xing in canonical quantization when there
is a gribov problem have been analysed by mcmullan [13].

2 bfv quantization

the starting point of the bfv approach is the unconstrained 2n-dimensional
phase space r2n, (with local coordinates (pi, qi), where i = 1, . . . , n) together
with a set of m rst class constraints ta(p, q) = 0, a = 1, . . . , m (with m < n)
and rst class hamiltonian hc(p, q). the true (reduced) phase space of this
system is then the space b = c/g where c is the submanifold of r2n
on which the constraints hold and g denotes the group generated by the
constraints (which acts naturally on c), with symplectic structure given by
the dirac bracket. (finite-dimensional language is used here, but in principle
the ideas can be extended, at least formally, to eld theory.) a set of gauge-
xing functions x a, a = 1, . . . , m are also introduced; the nature of these
functions is a central point of the discussion of this paper.

now, as is shown in [14], the generating functional is given by the faddeev

formula

[ (ta(p(t), q(t)))  (x a(p(t), q(t)))]!

z = z dpdq(cid:20)yt   m
ya=1
pa(t) qa(t)  hc(p(t), q(t))dt(cid:19)(cid:21),

 det(cid:0){ta(p(t), q(t)), x b(p(t), q(t))}(cid:1)
 exp(cid:18)iz t

0

(1)

where the integration is over paths p(t), q(t) in the unconstrained phase space
which begin and end at the same point. (standard quantization of the un-
constrained phase space in the schrodinger picture is used.) in establishing
this expression, further assumptions have to be made about the gauge-xing

3

functions x a, including the requirement that the matrix ({ta, x b}) (where
{ , } denotes the poisson bracket) must satisfy the condition
det({ta, x b}) 6= 0
(2)
at all points (p, q) in r2n. when it is not possible to nd a set of gauge-xing
functions satisfying these conditions there is a gribov problem [12], and it
is not possible to dene a unique representative of each class in the reduced
phase space c/b by picking out the zeroes of a set of gauge-xing functions.
(an example where this occurs is considered in section 5.)

the key idea in the bfv approach is to extend the phase space by in-
cluding lagrange multipliers la, a = 1, . . . , m for the constraints together
with their canonically conjugate momenta ka, a set of m ghosts, a together
with their conjugate momenta a and a set of m antighosts and correspond-
ing momenta a and a. an extended hamiltonian hext = hc + hh + hg
is then dened, with hg taking a form prescribed by the constraints, their
commutators, and the gauge-xing functions, while hh (which is often zero)
depends on the commutator of hc with the constraints. the extended hamil-
tonian is quite complicated, but it is shown in [5], by clever manipulation of
path integrals, both that the corresponding generating functional

z = z dpdqdkdldddd

(cid:20) exp(cid:16)iz t

0

p(t) q(t) + k(t) l(t) + (t) (t) + (t) (t)

hext(p(t), q(t), k(t), l(t), (t), (t), (t), (t))dt(cid:17)(cid:21)

(3)

is independent of the choice of gauge-xing functions and that it is equal
to the faddeev formula (1) for the generating functional for the original
hamiltonian on the reduced phase space. this result is known as the fradkin-
vilkovisky theorem.

3 brst cohomology and the fradkin-

vilkovisky theorem

a signicant insight of henneaux [6] was an interpretation of the bfv hamil-
tonian hext = hc +hh +hg in terms of the cohomology of the brst operator

4

 corresponding to the 2(m + n)-dimensional phase space (with typical point
(p, q, l, k)) subject to the constraints ta(p, q) = 0, ka = 0. henneaux showed
that the term hh (which contains ghosts) led to a modied hamiltonian
ht = hc + hh satisfying [ ht, ] = 0, while the term hg could be expressed as
i[, ] with a gauge-xing fermion  of ghost number 1 constructed from
the gauge-xing functions x a, a = 1, . . . , m in a prescribed way. henneaux
also demonstrated the correspondence between observables on the reduced
phase space and operators which commute with , and the related corre-
spondence between states for the reduced system and -cohomology classes.
henneaux proves the fradkin-vilkovisky theorem by showing that the
path integral (3) is invariant under innitesimal change of gauge-xing fermi-
on. however this is not a full proof, rst, because (as observed by govaerts
[8]) the space of orbits of the gauge group may not be connected, and second
because it must be shown that the space of possible gauge-xing fermions
includes one which gives the correct generating functional. (this is achieved
in the longer proof in [5] by showing that the path integral (3) reduces to
the faddeev formula (1) after integrating out the fermions and the lagrange
multiplier variables while rescaling the gauge-xing functions.)

now the faddeev formula (1) gives a useful expression for the reduced
phase space generating functional, but involves gauge-xing functions of a
kind which may not exist for a general system. however the existence of the
reduced phase space is quite independent of the existence of such gauge-xing
functions. indeed, as was shown quite generally by kostant and sternberg
[15], the space of observables on the reduced phase space is isomorphic to the
zero  cohomology on the extended phase space, so that the space of physical
states can be identied with the zero  cohomology group of states for the
extended phase space. this suggests that it might be possible to prove the
fradkin-vilkovisky theorem without reference to the faddeev formula, and
hence without recourse to gauge-xing functions satisfying (2), and it is just
such a programme which will be carried out here, showing that there is a
connection between the supertrace of an observable and the brst cohomol-
ogy of the states which leads to the fradkin-vilkovisky theorem, with precise
criteria which the gauge-xing fermion  must satisfy.

in the brst cohomology approach to gauge quantization in the schrod-
inger picture, the full space of states h consists of functions f (q, l, , ) of
the conguration space variables. (precisely which functions are included in
h depends on the system under consideration, as will be seen below; since
the inner product on states is not positive denite the usual l2 prescription

5

will not be valid.) the ghost number of a state is the degree in the ghost
variables  less the degree in the antighost variables , and physical states are
identied as elements of h 0(), (where for i = m, . . . , m, h i() denotes
the space of cohomology classes of  at ghost number i). observables are
operators on h which commute with , and thus have a well dened action
on the cohomology classes h i().
a new proof of the fradkin-vilkovisky theorem, with explicit conditions
which the gauge-xing fermion must satisfy, will now be given. the nonsin-
gularity conditions are that

(i) the only states which are zero eigenstates of the operator [, ] are

states of ghost number zero which are not -exact;

(ii) on each ghost and ht sector the real part of the eigenvalues n of i[, ]

tend to innity with n;

(iii) the hamiltonian ht must have nite trace on the space of zeroes of

[, ], on which it acts modulo .

as will be seen, the purpose of the rst condition is to ensure that  only has
cohomology at ghost-number zero, the second condition ensures that i[, ]
regularises the traces of non-physical states involved in the path integral and
the third ensures that the system does possess a generating functional.

the rst stage of the proof of the fradkin-vilkovisky theorem given in
this section is to show (by two lemmas) that the supertrace of exp [iht] gives
the trace of this operator over physical states, that is, the desired generating
functional.

for a given operator a on h, the supertrace is dened by

stra = tr ((1)g a)
where g denotes ghost number, so that (1)gf = f when f is a state of even
ghost number and (1)gf = f when f is a state of odd ghost number. (we
assume for the time being that the various innite sums here are well dened;
it will be seen below that this is ensured by the nonsingularity conditions.)
following henneaux and teitelboim (and the earlier work of schwarz [10]),
it is shown that taking the supertrace of an observable is equivalent to taking
the alternate sum of the traces over the cohomology classes h i().

(4)

6

lemma 3.1 suppose that a is an observable on h, so that [a, ] = 0.
then, assuming that the necessary traces exist,

stra =

m

(1)itrh i()a.

xi=m

(5)

proof we make the following decomposition of the space of states h:
h = g  f  e
where g = im  and g  e = ker . also, for i = m, . . . , m, let ei, fi
and gi denote the subspaces of e, f and g respectively with ghost number
m and fm are empty
i. then gi+1 = fi for i = m, . . . , m  1, while g
since the operator  raises ghost number by one and annihilates all states of
top ghost number.

(6)

now if f is an eigenstate of a with eigenvalue , then f is either zero or
also an eigenstate of a with the same eigenvalue; thus the map  : fi  gi+1
is an isomorphism, so that

trfia = trgi+1a,

(7)

which means that the contributions to the supertrace from fi and gi+1 cancel
giving

stra =

m

(1)itreia

xi=m

as required.

(8)

(cid:4)

it is next shown that, if  can be chosen so that [, ] has a certain

property, then  only has cohomology at ghost number zero.

lemma 3.2 if  can be chosen so that the operator [, ] is invertible except
on states of zero ghost number which are not -exact, then h p() is trivial
except when p is zero.

proof let v denote the subspace of states with non-zero ghost number.
suppose that f is a state in v such that f = 0 and that h = [, ]f . then

f = [, ]1h = [, ][, ]2h.

(9)

7

now, since [, ] is invertible on all states with non-zero ghost number and
exact states of zero ghost number,
[, ]2h = [, ]1[, ]1h = [, ]1f = 0,

(10)

so that
f = [, ][, ]2h

= [, ]2h.

thus f is cohomologically trivial.

(11)

(cid:4)

the proof of the fradkin-vilkovisky theorem is completed by the obser-
vation that (by standard arguments) the path integral expression (3) gives
the supertrace of the evolution operator exp [ihextt], which by the arguments

above must be the desired generating functional trphys exphi htti. the sec-

ond non-singularity condition ensures that the sums in the supertrace may
be reordered, in other words the additional term i[, ] in the hamiltonian
regularises the trace.

4 a simple example of the theorem

the rst application of the theorem is to the simple situation in which the
unconstrained phase space is r4 (with coordinates p1, p2, q1, q2) and there
is a single rst-class constraint p1 = 0. now it is clear that including the
gauge-xing condition q1 = 0 gives the reduced phase space with coordinates
p2, q2; the constraint simply means that one of the two dimensions in the
conguration space was redundant.
it will now be seen how this emerges
from the bfv formalism in a way which is useful in more complex situations,
following the quartet mechanism of henneaux and teitelboim [7] which
shows that in this case i[, ] is a number operator which is clearly invertible
on states of non-zero ghost number, as well as on exact states of zero ghost
number.

the extended phase space for this system has dimension (6, 4) with lo-
cal coordinates p1, p2, q1, q2, k, l, , , , . quantization is carried out using a
space of states which are functions of the variables q1, q2, l, , , while observ-
ables are built from the operators p1, p2, q1, q2, k, l, , , ,  with canonical
graded commutation relations
[pi, qj] = ij

[k, l] = i, [, ] = i and [, ] = i.

the operators pi and qi are represented in the standard way, while the action
of k, l, , , ,  is dened by

lf (q1, q2, l, , ) = ilf (q1, q2, l, , )
f (q1, q2, l, , ) = f (q1, q2, l, , )
f (q1, q2, l, , ) = i
f (q1, q2, l, , )
f (q1, q2, l, , ) = if (q1, q2, l, , )
f (q1, q2, l, , ) =
f (q1, q2, l, , ).

the inner product is dened by

plex conjugation of complex coecients so that p, q, k, l,  and  are her-
mitian while  and  are antihermitian. as always in brst quantization,
since the hermitian operator  has zero square, an indenite inner product
is required. the brst operator and gauge-xing fermion take the standard
forms

(18)

(with all other commutators zero), the full space of states is constructed from
vacuum states u

a, b,  and . (explicitly, the vacuum states are

u

2 (cid:19) exp()fu(q2)

where {fu} is an orthonormal basis of l2(r).) the full basis of states u

gives the orthonormality relation

(u

mnrs, u

(20)

(21)

the space of states h is then dened to be the space of states of the form
pm,n,r,s,u amnrsuu

mnrs where pm,n,r,s,u |amnrsu|2 is nite.

observing that the operator i[, ] can be expressed as

i[, ] = ab + ba +  +  

(22)

which has eigenvalue m + n + r + s on the state mnrs, that  +   is
the operator which gives the sum of the ghost and antighost number and
that all terms in  contain ghost or antighost creation operators it is clear
that the only zero eigenstates of [, ] have zero ghost number and are not
-exact. hence by lemma 3.2 the brst charge  has nontrivial cohomology
only at ghost number zero, as required; moreover, provided that the classical
hamiltonian hc is chosen so that exp ihct has a well dened trace on the
reduced phase space, the operator exp i(h + i[, ])t will have a well-dened
supertrace, and this will be calculated by the path integral (3).

to show how these ideas may be extended to more complex situations it is
useful to introduce the operators pmn(k, l), m, n = 1, . . . dened inductively
by
p00(k, l) = 1,

pm+1 n(k, l) = kpmn(k, l) + pmn(k, l)k,
pm n+1(k, l) = lpmn(k, l) + pmn(k, l)l.

(23)

(it is easily veried that this does consistently dene pmn for all non-negative
integers m and n.) then, since the vacuum is annihilated by a and b,
pmn(k, l)u

0 = im(a)m(b)nu
0

(24)

10

and also
i[, ]pmn(k, l)u

0 = i(kpmn(k, l)l  lpmn(k, l)k)u

0

(25)

so that
i(kpmn(k, l)l  lpmn(k, l)k) = (m + n + 1)pmn(k, l)
(26)
as can also be shown algebraically directly from the denition of pmn(k, l).
an alternative approach to the space of states for this system, also devel-
oping from the quartet mechanism, is given by marnelius and sandstrom [16]
in their interesting discussion of states in bfv quantization, and extended
to a wide variety of systems.

5 an example to show gauge-xing in the

presence of the gribov problem

4 = 0

4 ((p1)2 + (q1)2) and t2 = 1

an interesting toy example is the system described by henneaux and teit-
elboim [7] whose initial phase space is r4 (with coordinates p1, p2, q1, q2) on
which the single rst class constraint
t  t1 + t2  1
with t1 = 1
4 ((p2)2 + (q2)2), is imposed. in this
case the constraint surface c is the three-dimensional sphere s3. the group
action on c generated by t is most easily analysed by dening z1 = q1 + ip1,
z2 = q2 + ip2. then (with the standard prescription that (.) = {t,
.})
t acts as the innitesimal u(1) transformation zi = (1 + 1
2izi), giving as
true (reduced) phase space of the system the hopf bration s2 = s3/u(1),
which is well known to be non-trivial [17], so that the system has a gribov
problem. this means that no bosonic gauge-xing function x can be found
to directly ensure the validity of the faddeev formula (1). however the
approach developed in this paper does enable a gauge-xing procedure to be
set up.

(27)

to carry out the bfv quantization of this system the phase space is
extended to s1  r(5,4) with coordinates l, k, p1, p2, q1, q2, , ,  and , with
quantization of these variables as before, but with a dierent space of states.

4 , 3

some algebra shows that (if rows are labeled rst by m  n and then by
m + n) the commutator i[, ] is upper triangular with diagonal elements
having real part  (m + n + r + s). essentially the same arguments as in
the previous example then shows that the commutator [, ] does satisfy
the nonsingularity conditions. then, provided that a suitable hamiltonian
is used, that is, one which has a nite trace on the space of physical states,
the path integral with hamiltonian extended by i[, ] will give the correct
supertrace, and thus the desired trace over physical states.

6 conclusion

this paper establishes a criterion for the admissibility of a gauge-xing
fermion which can be applied to systems where the usual criteria are in-
adequate. in particular it is shown that, by introducing a gauge-xing term
which is not constructed by the standard prescription from a bosonic gauge-
xing function, it is possible to x the gauge of a system with a gribov
problem.
