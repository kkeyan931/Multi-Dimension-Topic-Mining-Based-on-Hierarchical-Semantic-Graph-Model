abstract

we show that supersymmetry ward identities contain an anomalous
term which takes the form of a surface term in hilbert space. in the one-
instanton sector the anomalous term is the integral of a total -derivative
where  is the instantons size. there are cases where the anomalous term
is non-zero, and cannot be modied by subtractions. this constitutes a
supersymmetry anomaly. the derivation is based on feynman rules suit-
able for any non-perturbative sector of a weakly-coupled, renormalizable
gauge theory.

1. introduction

following t hoofts pioneering work [1], instanton physics has played an im-
portant role in understanding the dynamics of asymptotically-free theories. mostly,
explicit instanton calculations were limited to the semi-classical approximation. a
two-loop calculation which is particularly relevant for supersymmetry (susy) can be
found in ref. [2].

there is no consistent regularization method which preserve susy [3]. in this
sense, susy is similar to a chiral symmetry. whether susy is a true symmetry at
the quantum level, or not, can be decided only by non-perturbative studies. this
question was previously addressed in the semi-classical approximation, where it was
found that susy is preserved. important works are based on the assumption that
this remains true beyond the semi-classical approximation, and that susy is an exact
symmetry in the continuum limit [4-10].

we begin with the investigation of ward identities in the most general path

integral setting. a ward identity reads

hoi = hs oi + h oi + h hilbert-space surface termsi ,

(1.1)

where the bold letter  denotes any innitesimal transformation. besides the familiar
terms containing the variations of the action (s) and the measure (), eq. (1.1)
contains also (the expectation value of) hilbert-space surface terms, which arise from
integration by parts in the functional integral.

in more detail, in each non-perturbative sector the path integration is over a
given set of collective coordinates n that characterize the classical background, as
well as over the amplitudes of the quantum-eld modes. the expectation value of a
(gauge invariant) operator o is

hoi =z dn esclw1w2 hoi .

(1.2)

here scl is the classical action, and the semi-classical measure, exp(w1), is the
product of functional determinants and a tree-level jacobian [1]. w2 is the sum of all
connected bubble diagrams, and hoi is the sum of all diagrams with external legs
dened by the operator o. all diagrams are obtained here by integrating over the
quantum elds, keeping the collective coordinates xed. eq. (1.2) applies to both
bare and renormalized quantities.

eq. (1.1) is derived in sec. 2. restricting our attention to the susy variation,
which we denote , we write s and  as spectral sums, and show that they both
vanish mode by mode. thus, hoi may fail to be zero only due to the hilbert-space
surface term. explicitly

hoi =z dn



n (cid:16)esclw1w2 hn oi(cid:17) ,

(1.3)

where n is the susy variation of the n-th collective coordinate.

the tools of functional dierentiation and integration used in sec. 2 are very
useful in clarifying the algebraic structure that underlies eq. (1.3). however, manipu-
lations of the (formal) path integral should be supported by a detailed diagrammatic
calculation. in sec. 3 we turn to the instanton sector of four-dimensional susy gauge
theories. only the integral of the total -derivative is not automatically zero ( is
the instanton size). the anomalous term may thus be represented as an amplitude
involving a zero-size instanton. an anomaly due to a topological singularity was pre-
viously found in supersymmetric quantum mechanics in the presence of uxons with
a fractional magnetic ux [11].

we consider the susy ward identity (1.3) at the leading non-trivial order for a
specic bi-local operator in super yang-mills theory. our main result is the anomalous
ward identity eq. (3.10), and its local version eq. (3.38). both equations are valid
in any renormalization prescription where perturbation theory is supersymmetric.
while the leading contribution to the   0 surface term on the r.h.s. of eq. (3.10) is
a tree diagram, a straightforward calculation of the expectation value of o involves
loop diagrams. the proof of eq. (3.10) thus requires careful separation of short- and
long-distance contributions. we also generalize the result to supersymmetric qcd.
an important question is how eq. (3.10) is modied by higher-order corrections. a
renormalization-group argument indicates that the anomalous term should remain
nite (and non-zero) after the inclusion of next-order logarithmic corrections.

the limit of a vanishing instanton size,   0, is studied in more detail in sec. 4.
in correlation functions involving operators of suciently high dimension, the lower
limit of the -integral may diverge. under these circumstances one should perform
non-perturbative subtractions. our main result is that no non-perturbative subtrac-
tion can possibly modify eq. (3.10). therefore eq. (3.10) constitutes a supersymmetry
anomaly. we also discuss how the anomaly should arise on the lattice.

there are important non-perturbative sectors where one is not expanding around
an exact solution of the classical eld equations. this is true in the one-instanton
sector of theories with a scalar (higgs) vev, as well as in the instanton-antiinstanton
sector. aiming to cover these cases too, we have developed landau-gauge feynman
rules for any non-perturbative sector of a renormalizable gauge theory (appendix b).
the feynman rules dene a systematic expansion provided the considered correlation
function is infra-red convergent, and provided the background eld is almost a
classical solution.

arming the validity of the perturbative expansion must be done on a case
by case basis.
(a more detailed discussion of the one-instanton sector of susy-
higgs theories will be given elsewhere.) however, the basic ward identity (1.3) can
be derived in a completely general way using the feynman rules of appendix b.
this is done in appendix c. we give a fully detailed diagrammatic derivation in the
(physically less interesting) case of a theory without a gauge symmetry. because of
its technical complexity, we outline the generalization to gauge theories but omit the
arithmetical details.

much of the technical material contained in this paper is devoted to various
detailed proofs. a rst acquaintance with the algebraic structure may be obtained by

3

reading sec. 2 up to subsection 2.2. in order to understand the content of eq. (3.10) it
is enough to read sec. 3 up to subsection 3.1. the local form of eq. (3.10) is discussed
in subsection 3.5, and the renormalization-group argument is given in subsection 3.6.
the proof that eq. (3.10) cannot be modied by subtractions is given in subsection 4.1.
the notation used throughout the paper is dened in appendix a. in appendix d
we explain how the general formalism of sec. 2 works in the case of translation
invariance. our conclusions are given in sec. 5.

2. path-integral derivation of susy ward identities

in this section we derive the anomalous ward identity (1.3) using the tools of
functional integration and dierentiation. while the (unregularized) path integral
is a formal construct, the derivation serves to clarify both the underlying algebraic
structure, and the role of physical boundary conditions. the results of this section
are supported by the detailed diagrammatic calculations of sec. 3 and appendix c.
the notation of appendix a is used below. the general and the susy ward
identities (eqs. (1.1) and (1.3) respectively) will be derived using the transverse-eld
path integral dened in the rst four subsections of appendix b. (the rest of ap-
pendix b, which is devoted to the construction of the tree-level propagators etc., is
not needed for this section.)

2.1. the eld variation

the independent variables of the path integral include the collective coordinates
n, the gauge degrees of freedom a(x), and the amplitudes of the quantum modes
p and p where

(x) xpz b

p (x) p ,

(x) xpz f

p (x) p ,

(2.1)

p (x) (f

p (x)) is the eigenfunction corresponding to p ( p). in this paper the
and b
quantum bosonic eld, (x), is assumed to be transverse. namely, it obeys the back-
ground gauge condition a (x) = 0 (eq. (b.5)) in addition to the orthogonality con-
ditions (b;m| ) = 0 (eq. (b.16)) where b;m is the covariant derivative of the classical
eld with respect to m. the above constraints may be summarized as (b;m| ) = 0,
where the capital index m runs over the ordinary collective coordinates and over the
innitely-many collective coordinates associated with local gauge transformations, see
appendix b.4.

we begin by expanding an arbitrary variation of an elementary eld in terms of
variations of the independent path-integral variables. for the variation of a boson
eld, b(x), one has

b(x) =  (x) +(cid:16)b;n(x) + ;n(x)(cid:17) n +(cid:16)a(b(x))  igt a (x)(cid:17) a(x) .

(2.2)

4

covariant n-derivatives of the quantum eld are obtained by dierentiating the eigen-
functions (see also appendix b.3)

while the quantum-eld variation is, by denition

;n(x) =xpz b
 (x) xpz b

p;n(x) p ,

p (x)  p .

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

the eld variation acts on the quantum amplitudes p and not on the eigenfunc-
tions. the dierential operator a generates innitesimal gauge transformations of
the classical bosonic eld (appendix b.1). the variation of a fermion eld, (x), is
expanded as

where

(x) =  (x) + n ;n(x)  ig a(x) t a (x) ,
;n(x) =xpz f
p (x)  p ,

 (x) xpz f

p;n(x) p ,

in analogy with the bosonic case. (the reader should note that (x) and  (x)
have dierent meanings.) for the susy variation, ordering matters in eq. (2.5). it
follows from eq. (2.4) that  (x) obeys the same orthogonality constraints as does
(x). this allows us to extract the variations n and a(x). considering eq. (2.2)
and taking the inner product (a.5) with b;n leads to

m = c 1

mnn(b;n| ) + ig(b

;nt a |a)o ,

where cmn is dened in eq. (b.14) and we have used eq. (b.7). we have specialized
to the susy case, where the bosons variation is linear in the fermions, see eq. (a.7).
(for any other variation, simply replace    and    b.) note that b;n is
o(1/g), and m is o(g). we next apply  on both sides of eq. (2.2). using the
gauge-xing constraint (b.5) and eliminating m we nd

a = (f 1)ab|b  )

+ig(f 1)ab|b
here f 1 = f 1
0 +   , where f0 and fint occur respectively in the
tree-level and interaction ghost lagrangians (eq. (b.37)). eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) are
summarized by the compact formula (cf. eq. (b.31))

mn (b;n| ) .

0 fintf 1

0  f 1

;mt b ) c 1

(2.8)

m = c1

m n(b;n| ) .

(2.9)

the variation of a given quantum amplitude is obtained by taking the inner

product of eq. (2.2) or (2.5) with the corresponding eigenmode. explicitly,

 p = (b

for bosons, and

 p = (f

(2.11)

for fermions. the last term is these equations compensates for the m-dependence of
the eigenmodes.

2.2. ward identities

the variation of any local operator can be expressed in terms of the variations of

the independent variables. one has

o = t o ,
where t is the functional dierentiation operator

t =xpz  qp

will be interested in gauge invariant operators, which eectively restricts the last
sum to n = n only. the expectation value of o is given by the functional integral

integrating by parts we obtain the generic ward identity for gauge invariant operators

where s and  are respectively the variations of the action and the measure. ex-
plicitly s = t s and

   t log( det c

(2.16)

the last term on the r.h.s. of eq. (2.15) is the hilbert-space surface term of eq. (1.1).
the corresponding surface term for the quantum amplitudes qp is zero because of the
gaussian integration.

in the rest of this section we consider susy ward identities. we compute s
and , and prove that they both vanish mode by mode. this leaves us with the last
term in eq. (2.15). when the functional integration over the quantum elds is done,
this term is recognized as the r.h.s. of eq. (1.3).

the susy transformation is o-diagonal in that it maps bosons into fermions
and vice versa. in view of this, the invariance of the measure,  = 0, is an expected
result. nevertheless, the below derivation gives us valuable information on how the
cancelation of the various contributions to  works in practice. we also nd that
the physical boundary conditions play a direct role. the same elements reappear in

6

the diagrammatic proof of appendix c which is more rigorous and, at the same time,
technically more involved.

the presence of a hilbert-space surface term in ward identities is not an unfa-
miliar situation.
in appendix d we apply the generic ward identity (2.15) to the
case of translation invariance. we show that momentum is conversed because the
hilbert-space surface term coincides in this case with a spacetime surface term.

2.3. variation of the action

the functional variation of the action consists of a volume integral and a surface
integral. the latter may in general depend on the choice of functional variables, and
it is our objective to determine it. we start with the action principle

z ddx (l  (q )) =z ddx q (; + l/q) .

(2.17)

as usual l = l(q, q,) and  = l/q,. substituting eqs. (2.2) and (2.5) into
the r.h.s. of eq. (2.17) and integrating by parts leads to
z ddx q (; + l/q) = z ddx  q (; + l/q)

(2.18a)

+nz ddx(cid:16)q;n; + q;n(l/q)(cid:17)
ni d j n

 .

(2.18b)

(2.18c)

gauge invariance of the action was used. (note that l/q = l/ q.) here

j n
 = q;n  .

(2.19)

let us write t = tq + t in correspondence with the two terms on the r.h.s. of
eq. (2.13). since n-derivatives act on the classical eld or on the wave-functions
(eq. (b.19)), expression (2.18b) is equal to t s. now, in terms of the mode ampli-
tudes, the bilinear part of the action reads

s(2) =

1

2xpz p q2

p ,

(2.20)

where p is an eigenvalue of the small uctuations operator, lp = pp. conse-
quently

tq s(2) =xpz p  qp qp = ( q|l|q) .

(2.21)

in innite volume l must act on q(x), and not on  q(x). the expression on the r.h.s.
of row (2.18a) is therefore equal to tq s. putting everything together we arrive at the
following result

t s =z ddx l i d (q ) + ni d j n

 .

(2.22)

7

eq. (2.22) is completely general. in the susy case, l is a total derivative and

t s =i d s + ni d j n

 ,

where s is the susy current. in order to understand the last surface term we employ
a nite volume cuto. this term is then completely determined by the boundary
conditions and, for any boundary conditions which ensure the hermiticity of the small
uctuation operators,

i d p,n  = 0 .

(2.23)

(2.24)

we note that eq. (2.24) holds for each eigenmode p separately. this implies the

operator statement h d j n

 = 0.

2.4. variation of the measure

computing the variation of the measure is a straightforward algebraic task. the

rst term on the r.h.s. of eq. (2.16) is

t log( detc

det

2 c0) = c1

1

lk t ckl 

1
2

(c0)1

lk t (c0)kl .

the classical-valued matrix c0 depends only on the collective coordinates, and

t (c0)kl = m (c0)kl;m = n (c0)kl;n .

(2.25)

(2.26)

the last equality is true since (c0)kl;m = 0 for any collective coordinate m which
corresponds to an exact symmetry. the latter always include (local) gauge transfor-
mations and (global) translations. hence the non-zero terms always correspond to a
subset of the ordinary collective coordinates n.

relation

in the calculation of the eld-dependent part t c1 we use the bosonic closure
(2.27)

p )(b

1 =xpz |b

p | +xmz |bm)(bm| ,

where bm = (c1/2

0

)m n b;n are normalized. including the contribution from c0 one has
(2.28)

t ckl = n ckl;n + m ckm;l  (b;k;l| )  m (b;k|b;m;l) .

next, using eq. (2.9) we have

(n)

n

= c1

nk ckl;n l + c1

nk(b;k| ),n .

what remains is the contribution from the functional trace. for the fermions

(2.29)

(2.30)

where eq. (2.11) and the closure relation for fermions were used. for the bosons,
starting from eq. (2.10) one has

p |b

p;n)  m xpz (b

collecting all terms we obtain

 = n xpz ()f (p|p;n) + n xmz (bm|bm;n)

+m c1

lk (b;k|b;m;l  b;l;m) .

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

the rst term on the r.h.s. is a spectral trace over (transverse) bosons and fermions.
as with the variation of the action we now employ a nite volume cuto. the modes
are normalized, namely, (p|p) = 1. hence (p|p;n) = 0. similarly, (bm|bm;n) =
0. finally, as we show below, the commutator (the last term in eq. (2.33)) is in fact
a spectral trace over the ghosts eld, which is zero for the same reason. thus, 
vanishes mode by mode.

2.5. ghosts contribution

we last consider the commutator in eq. (2.33). using appendices b.3 and b.4
and inserting a complete set of ghosts eigenstates, the commutator can be rewritten
as

(2.34)

(2.35)

(2.36)

(2.37)

(b;k|b;m;l  b;l;m) = (b;k|(a  igt a )f a
m l is a generalized eld strength and

where f a

m l) =xpz ckp fpm l ,

fpm l = (ca

p|f a

m l) .

hence

lk (b;k|b;m;l  b;l;m) =xpz c1
c1
where explicitly
fpmp = (ca

p|ca

p;m) .

lk ckp fpm l =xpz fpmp ,

we see that the commutator in eq. (2.33) is a spectral trace over the ghost eld,
which vanishes in nite volume too.

in summary, using the (formal) tools of functional dierentiation and integra-
tion we showed that the only anomalous term in susy ward identities is a surface

9

term in hilbert space, cf. eq. (1.3). the contributions of s and  (cf. eq. (2.15))
vanish mode by mode. we note that the classical equation of motion was nowhere
used. consequently, eq. (1.3) should hold in any non-perturbative sector, regardless
of whether or not one is expanding around an exact classical solution. a detailed
diagrammatic proof of this statement is given in appendix c.

3. anomalous supersymmetry ward identities

in this section we turn to the one-instanton sector of super yang-mills (sym)
theory. our main result is a susy ward identity whose anomalous term is non-zero
and unambiguous. the same anomalous term is obtained using any renormalization
scheme where perturbation theory is supersymmetric. moreover, as shown in sec. 4,
no non-perturbative subtraction can modify this result. similar statements apply to
supersymmetric qcd (sqcd).

we begin (subsection 3.1) with a leading-order calculation of hoi for a specic
gauge-invariant bi-local operator in sym (eq. (3.10)). eq. (1.3) is used in the calcula-
tion. as already mentioned in the introduction, the result arises from (the -integral
of) a total -derivative.

in the next two subsections we conrm eq. (3.10) by a detailed diagrammatic
calculation. working at xed  we show (subsection 3.2) that every diagram which
contributes to hoi is related to a diagram which contributes to the -derivative of
hoi. while hoi is a tree diagram to leading order, one encounters loop dia-
grams in a direct same-order calculation of hoi. in subsection 3.3 we prove that
the (tree-diagram) r.h.s. is equal to the (one-loop renormalized) l.h.s. of eq. (3.10).
a key role is played by the recursion relations of appendix b.6. (while this dis-
cussion is given in terms of a concrete example, it actually proves the validity after
renormalization of eq. (1.3), whenever its r.h.s. consists of tree diagrams only.)

in subsection 3.4 we generalize the result to sqcd, and in subsection 3.5 we
discuss the local form of the anomaly. in subsection 3.6 we give a renormalization-
group argument that the anomalous term should remain nite, and non-zero, after
the inclusion of higher-order logarithmic corrections.

we now give a quick review of (super) yang-mills instantons taking the gauge
group to be su(2). in sym one expands around an exact, scale-invariant classical
solution, and the feynman rules are considerably simpler than those of appendix b.
the (regular gauge) instanton eld is

ac
 =

2
g

c(x  x0)
(x  x0)2 + 2 ,

(3.1)

where c is the t hooft symbol [1]. (c is antisymmetric in the last two indices;
c = c if ,  = 1, 2, 3, and c4 = c.) there are eight gauge-eld zero modes
(b;n in our generic notation). their explicit (unnormalized) form is ac
;n. as explained
in appendix b.1, each zero mode constitutes of an ordinary derivative of the classical
eld with respect to a collective coordinate, plus a compensating (proper) gauge

10

transformation to enforce the background gauge d a;n = 0. we now list the various
zero modes. first, for the dilatation zero mode, covariant and ordinary dierentiations
coincide i.e. ac
,. for the zero modes associated with the translation collective
coordinates x
 = ac
.
explicitly a; = a,  d a = f.

the last term in parenthesis generates a proper gauge transformation, whereas the
rst term generates a global su(2) transformation. during the quantization proce-
dure described in appendix b.2 one introduces global su(2) collective coordinates
a alongside with the translation and dilatation ones. as follows from eq. (3.3),
a 2/((x  x0)2 + 2),
the isospin modes obey a;a = a,a  d a where g a
in agreement with the general formula eq. (b.6). then, in gauge invariant correla-
tion functions the isospin collective coordinates factor out, yielding a group-volume
factor [1].

a = a

we next turn to the gaugino. because of the chiral nature of instanton amplitudes
it is often more natural to use a weyl notation, where the majorana-eld gaugino is
split as majorana  , .. similarly, we will distinguish between the susy variations
 and . (both of which are accounted for in eq. (a.7)). in su(2) sym there are
two pairs of gaugino zero modes. in normalized form they are given by

where 1 is the one-loop renormalization-group invariant scale. in sym the functional
determinants, cf. eq. (b.45), cancel each other exactly. the matrix c0 (eq. (b.14a)) is
diagonal. the entries related to the translation and the dilatation modes have mass
dimension zero, while those related to the three isospin zero modes have dimension
minus two. the 3 factor in eq. (3.9) thus arises from the isospin entries of det
2 c0.
in (potentially) singular cases, the integration over the translation collective co-
ordinates x
0 should always be done before the -integration. this guarantees transla-
tion invariance. also, it implies that the integral of the total x0-derivative in eq. (1.3)
vanishes. the isospin collective coordinates too do not give rise to any hilbert-space
surface term, because group-integration is compact.

for 2  y2 the -integrand behaves like y/7 (see subsection 4.1 below). the integral
is infra-red convergent, and the  =  boundary point drops out from eq. (3.13).
eq. (3.13) says that the anomalous term can be expressed solely in terms of an
amplitude of a zero-size instanton. this mathematical statement has one misleading
aspect. namely, the dominant contribution to the -integral which leads to eq. (3.10)
comes from nite-size instantons with 2  y2. eq. (3.10) is insensitive to the contri-
butions of vanishingly-small instantons. if we restrict the integration to    < 
for some 0 < 2  y2, the relative change in the result will be o(2/y2). the limit
  0 is smooth. we return to these observations in sec. 4.

eq. (3.10), one gaugino eld from (y) is contracted with

 (0), one obtains a contribution that vanishes
in the limit   0 due to an extra damping factor of 2/y2.) now, because of the
operator o i
 , the integration over the instanton position is dominated by x0  .
the integral in eq. (3.14), in turn, is dominated by x  y.
in the calculation of
the   0 boundary term, this allows us to replace the (singular gauge) fermion
propagator gf (y, x) by a free propagator. we nd

we now put together eqs. (3.16) and (3.17), include a symmetry factor

3.2. diagrams

in this subsection we describe in detail how eq. (3.10) works at the level of feyn-
man diagrams. this provides a concrete leading-order example of the general dia-
grammatic identities of appendix c. the renormalization of the loop diagrams en-
countered in the derivation will be discussed in the next subsection.

taking a slightly dierent course from appendix c, our starting point is the

observation that, in sym,

z d4x d s(x) oe,x0

= 0 ,

13

(3.18)

for any (multi)local operator o. here, o will be taken to be the bi-local operator in
eq. (3.10). in the generic notation of appendix a, susy invariance of the action can
be expressed as the o-shell identity

and the interaction lagrangians are dened in eqs. (b.43) and (b.44). the expressions
inside the parenthesis in eq. (3.19) are recognized as the (bosonic and fermionic) equa-
tions of motion. below we will repeatedly use eqs. (3.18) and (3.19). (we have used
the notation s in the above o-shell relation to distinguish it from the operator
 s; the latter is discussed in subsection 3.5 below.)

the rst diagrams that contribute to hoi are o(1/g2) in comparison to the
r.h.s. of eq. (3.10). at this order, hoi vanishes for rather trivial reasons, as we now
explain. for any susy theory, the leading-order terms in eq. (3.19) are

s(0)

(3.23)

like eq. (3.19), eq. (3.23) is an o-shell relation in which only the classical equation
of motion is used. the fermion propagator emanating from s(0)
 ends on any one of
the ve s in the operator o. the other four s are saturated by zero modes. we
next eliminate this fermionic propagator using eq. (3.7). only the delta-function from
eq. (3.7) contributes to hoi. the terms with the projector pf cancel each other
by antisymmetry. these steps are depicted in fig. 2. (see fig. 1 for our feynman
rules.) to this order, the diagrams contributing to hoi involve the fermionic zero
modes and the classical eld, and nothing else. as in eq. (3.18), the vanishing result
is obtained before the integration over any of the collective coordinates.

we now turn to the more interesting next order, that corresponding to eq. (3.10).
first, there is a set of disconnected diagrams which is trivially zero, since it consists
of the same diagrams considered above (fig. 2) times a sum of bubble diagrams.
(the bubble diagrams (fig. 3) were discussed in detail in ref. [2]. note that, besides
the familiar two-loop diagrams, fig. 3 contains a one-loop diagram coming from the
o-diagonal terms of the jacobian (b.13) or, equivalently, from the interaction term
on the last row of eq. (b.39). this is the only place where that term occurs at this
order.)

14

we next consider fig. 4. the shown diagrams are related by interchanging the
insertion of s(0)
 with one of the zero modes. thanks to this antisymmetrization,
the fermionic projector terms of eq. (3.7) cancel out. after the application of eq. (3.7),
the second diagram gives a contribution to o.
is attached
to a fermionic interaction vertex. on the l.h.s. of fig. 5 we show only the connected
part of this diagram containing s(0)
 . now, the terms in eq. (3.19) which are linear
in both the fermion and the boson elds read

in the rst diagram of fig. 4, the propagator emanating from s(0)


s(1)

 = 


lb   + (1)



lf  + (0)sf .

(3.24)

after the application of eq. (3.7), the l.h.s. of fig. 5 gives rise to an insertion of (minus
the integral of) the last term in eq. (3.24) (middle fig. 5). using eq. (3.18), the latter
is traded with an insertion of the rst two terms on the r.h.s. of eq. (3.24). explicitly,
this insertion is

( |lb| ) + ((1)|lf | ) .

(3.25)

this step is depicted on the r.h.s. of fig. 5. (eq. (3.25) coincides with eq. (c.2) up
to the replacement   (1).)
we now apply eqs. (3.8) and (3.7) to the diagram containing insertion (3.25).
the terms with the fermionic projector cancel by antisymmetry as before. all other
terms are shown in fig. 6. the last diagram, which involves a longitudinal projector,
will be discussed later. the rst diagram on the r.h.s. of fig. 6 is a contribution to
o. (this contribution is a tree or a one-loop diagram, depending on whether the
two external legs correspond to dierent spacetime points or to the same one.) the
second diagram vanishes by the same fiertz rearrangement used in proving the susy
invariance of the action. (here we are ignoring the need for regularization, see the
next subsection).

the third diagram on the r.h.s. of fig. 6 is a contribution to the r.h.s. of eq. (3.10).
. at the same
the bosonic zero mode b;n at the upper-left corner of the triangle, the 
spacetime point and the thick dashed line representing c 1
0 , together form the leading
order of n. the other bosonic zero mode is attached to a fermion line emanating
from a fermionic zero mode. denoting the zero mode by f 0, this part of the diagram
gives the n-derivative f 0

we now consider two more diagrams with insertion (3.25). the third diagram on
the r.h.s. of fig. 7 gives the n-derivative of the fermionic propagator emanating from
n. fig. 8 contains a one-loop tadpole which is actually zero in sym. in general, the
third diagram on the r.h.s. of fig. 8 gives the n-derivative of the (logarithm of the)
functional determinants.

;n = gf (lf );n f 0.

let us consider separately the boson, fermion and ghost contributions in the
second diagram on the r.h.s. of fig. 8. the fermion-loop contribution is by itself zero
after a fiertz rearrangement. the ghost-loop diagram will be considered later. for
the sum of the remaining one-(bosonic)-loop diagram, plus the rst diagram on the
r.h.s. of fig. 7, we use

s(2)

 = s(3,b)

i j k (b)  i

lf  + (1)sf .

(3.26)

15

this allows us to trade the two bosonic-loop diagrams with a single diagram contain-

lf . using eq. (3.7) once more, we obtain the contribution(s)
ing an insertion of (2)
to o coming from (2) (fig. 9).
another type of diagrams with insertion (3.25) is obtained by attaching the
bosonic propagator to a quantum gauge eld coming from a covariant derivative
(cf. eq. (3.12)). one obtains two contributions to o and a contribution to the r.h.s.
of eq. (3.10), in which the classical eld in the background covariant derivative is
dierentiated with respect to n (fig. 10).

we next attach the bosonic propagator from insertion (3.25) to a vertex coming
from the expansion of the jacobian (fig. 11). the second term on the r.h.s. of fig. 11
gives the n-derivative of the bosonic zero mode contained in n itself.

1

the third diagram on the r.h.s. of fig. 11 gives the n-derivative of log det

2 c0.
particularly relevant for eq. (3.10) are -derivatives. as explained earlier, the -
dependence of det c0 comes from the entries related to the three isospin zero modes.
in the matrix c1 (eq. (b.14b)), the isospin-isospin entries (c1)ac involve the integral
of gabc b
/, the result can
be written as ig tr a,a[c , a/]. this yields the -derivative of det

,a (cf. eq. (3.3)). after taking the product with aa

2 c0, since

(3.27)

the contribution of the last term is zero after integration by parts (which is allowed
since  c/ vanishes rapidly enough at innity) using d a,a = 0. (the above is
an example of the commutator formulae of appendix b.3.)

last we discuss all diagrams with the longitudinal projector. compare the last
two diagrams in fig. 6. these diagrams have the same topology, but the meaning of
the various elements is dierent. recalling the spectral decomposition of the ghost
propagator, the analog of the zero mode b;n is now aca
p is a ghost eigenstate
(see below eq. (3.8), and appendix b.4). similarly, the corresponding inverse eigen-
value (associated with the ghost propagator) is the analog of c 1
(the thick dashed
line). thus, those elements which constitute n in the third diagram, correspond in
the last diagram to p = (ca

p|a) (both to leading order).

p where ca

similarly to what we did with the bosonic modes b;n, the insertion of aca

p on
a fermion line can be traded with a local gauge transformation with parameter ca
p,
acting on the eld(s) at the end(s) of the line. the sum of the resulting diagrams,
where the gauge transformation acts on the elds of o, vanish by gauge invariance
of o. in addition there are diagrams that vanish thanks to gauge invariance of the
semi-classical jacobian, or of p itself. one last piece is provided by the ghost-
loop diagram that has remained from the second term on the r.h.s. of fig. 8. it is

a  
recognized as a contribution to the gauge transformation of the product ca
p
occurring in p.

the above completes the diagrammatic analysis of eq. (3.10), except for countert-

erm diagrams. these will be discussed in the next subsection.

16

3.3. one-loop renormalization

several types of loop diagrams occur in the calculation of eq. (3.10), and the
corresponding divergences are renormalized by counterterms. in this subsection we
complete the proof of eq. (3.10), assuming that renormalized perturbation theory is
supersymmetric.
(this statement means that the perturbative s-matrix is super-
symmetric, and that perturbative matrix elements of composite operators fall into
supermultiplets.) we assume that the counterterms were constructed using the back-
ground eld method [13]. for deniteness we will refer to dimensional regularization,
but the discussion generalizes to any other consistent regularization as well. as men-
tioned earlier, the below arguments are actually sucient to prove eq. (1.3) after
renormalization, whenever its r.h.s. consists of tree diagrams only.

as explained in the previous subsections, the two-loop bubble diagrams that occur
on the l.h.s. of eq. (3.10) are multiplied by zero. thus, we need not concern ourselves
here with the corresponding counterterm diagrams. (there are delicate points in the
renormalization of the bubble diagrams, see ref. [2]; these will become relevant at
higher orders.)

we next consider the ghost-loop diagram contained in the second term on the
r.h.s. of fig. 8, and all the (loop) diagrams with the longitudinal projector p k. as
discussed in the previous subsection, the sum of these diagrams is zero by gauge
invariance. since (background) gauge invariance is preserved by the regularization,
this cancelation continues to hold.

the remaining divergences arise from one-loop diagrams containing boson or
fermion propagators, and no ghost propagator. renormalization of these diagrams
requires us to face two obstacles. first, dimensional regularization treats a loop as a
single entity. equations like eq. (b.64), (3.8) or (3.7) do not hold for d  4 6= 0. we
must therefore replace these equations by ones that hold for arbitrary d. the second
(related) complication is that susy, as expressed by eq. (3.19), is broken by terms
proportional to d  4.
we now explain how dimensional regularization is applied to an instanton-sector
diagram. first, repeating n times the recursion relation for the generic fermion prop-
agator gf , eq. (b.68), we obtain

f

f

(cid:17) gvac

f (cid:17)k
nxk=0(cid:16) vf gvac

gf =(cid:16)1  p exact

f (cid:17)n+1
(the superscript vac denotes free-eld quantities, and vf = lf  lvac
f . notice the
terms with the projector p exact
, which cut open any loop containing gf .) we now
take n (nite and) high enough, such that any loop containing lf times the last term
in eq. (3.28) will be nite. eq. (b.64) may be applied to the last term, and the result
is

+ gf(cid:16) vf gvac

(3.28)

lf gf =(cid:16)lvac

(3.30)

f

f gvac

eqs. (3.28) and (3.29) provide the key for regularization. comparing eq. (3.29)
with eq. (b.64), we see that the term with p exact
has been separated out explicitly.
the remaining terms, which replace the delta-function in eq. (b.64), are identical to
what one would have found in a standard perturbative expansion. any (loop) diagram
containing (only) these perturbative-expansion terms is amenable to dimensional (or
f (x, y) = 4(x  y) is true in the regularized
any other) regularization. (if lvac
theory, then eq. (3.29) reduces to eq. (b.64).)
(in sym, the bosonic and fermionic propagators in the instanton sector obey
eqs. (3.8) and (3.7) respectively, and the above analysis is applicable to both of them.
in the bosonic equivalent of eq. (3.29), p exact
is replaced by pb + p k. the ghost
propagator contained in the longitudinal projector (cf. eq. (b.61)) obeys the standard
recursion relation (b.66). in the most general case gb is dened by eq. (b.54). the
last term in this equation cuts open any loop since (like projectors) it involves a
localized source. as for gb, it is convenient (cf. appendix b.6) to consider rst
 6= 0. then gb obeys eq. (b.48) and the standard recursion relation (b.66). using
eq. (b.59), all term involving 1/ may be replaced by expressions that have a smooth
  0 limit.)
let us now examine, in comparison, the background-eld fermion propagator in
the vacuum sector. this propagator obeys the standard recursion relation (b.66)
and, therefore, identities analogous to eqs. (3.28) and (3.29) but without projector
terms. similarly, the vacuum-sector identities for the background-eld transverse
boson propagator contain the longitudinal projector, but no analog of the projector
pb.

f

when the manipulations based on eq. (3.19) are carried out in the vacuum sector,
all (nite) violations of susy that survive the removal of the regularization can be
canceled by an appropriate (non-supersymmetric) set of counterterms [14]. the can-
celation of susy violations arising from the loop regularization continues to hold in
the instanton sector. as a result, whenever lb gb or lf gf arise inside some (ampu-
tated) one-loop diagram (from the application of eq. (3.19)) this yields a renormalized
diagrammatic identity in the instanton sector which diers from the corresponding
one in the vacuum sector precisely by the projector terms p exact
and pb. as shown in
the previous subsection, all diagrams with an insertion of p exact
cancel by antisym-
metry, while those containing pb combine with diagrams that involve the functional
jacobian to form the total n- (and in particular -) derivatives.

f

f

we now explain how the last statement works in practice. consider rst the
loop diagram on the l.h.s. of fig. 7, which originates from the self-energy diagram
in fig. 12(a). there is a corresponding counterterm diagram, shown in fig. 12(b).
(as mentioned earlier, the sum of one-loop tadpoles in fig. 8 is zero in sym.) now,
the r.h.s. of figs. 7 and 8 also contains loop diagrams, to which we have to apply
eq. (3.26), cf. fig. 9. that equation, which is an expression of susy of the action,
is broken in dimensional regularization by an amount proportional to d  4. when
multiplied by (d  4)1 coming from the loop divergence, a (nite) explicit breaking
of susy may result. this explicit breaking is canceled, however, by an appropriate
non-supersymmetric set of counterterms. consequently, the renormalized equalities

18

represented by gs. 7, 8 and 9 hold after adding the counterterm diagram.

a second set of one-loop diagrams can be found in figs. 4, 5 and 6 (provided
both of the external legs go to the same spacetime point). the divergences in these
gures correspond to the composite operators  or o i
 (eq. (3.11)), or to their susy
variations. for example, () = (i/2) f . however, in general
[](1) 6= (i/2)[f ](1) ,

(3.31)

where [  ](1) is the corresponding one-loop counterterm. the l.h.s. of inequality (3.31)
is shown in fig. 13(a), while its r.h.s. is fig. 13(b). (the counterterms are normally
o(g2), but when they involve a classical eld they become o(g).) again, the countert-
erms are designed to compensate for any discrepancy that may have arisen from the
loop regularization. with the counterterm diagrams added, the equalities of figs. 4,
5 and 6 hold after renormalization. finally, the loops of fig. 10 are treated in a sim-
ilar manner. we leave it for the reader to work out the corresponding counterterm
diagrams. this completes the proof of eq. (3.10).

at higher orders, the renormalization of eq. (3.10) is more complicated, because
one must deal with the divergences arising from the coupling between the discrete-
and the continuous-index parts of the jacobian. this problem was addressed in ref. [2].
a related problem is that one must deal with the divergences of . in subsection 3.6
below we use a renormalization-group argument to determine the next-order logarith-
mic corrections to eq. (3.10).

3.4. susy theories with matter

it is easy to generalize eq. (3.10) to su(2) sqcd. let the number of avors be
nf . (by convention, for su(2) each avor corresponds to two chiral supermultiplets
in the fundamental representation. each (massless) weyl-fermion eld has one zero
mode.) one has

7g7

(3.33)
we have assumed y2m2  1 where m is a generic matter-eld mass. this implies that
only the zero modes contribute in eq. (3.33). as shown in subsection 4.1 below, both
eq. (3.10) and eq. (3.32) cannot be modied by subtractions and, hence, constitute a
supersymmetry anomaly. eq. (3.32) reects a general feature, namely, the anomalous
term may be a polynomial in some of the external momenta (here the polynomial in
q reduces to a constant).

for su(n), one should replace o i

 by an operator whose generic structure
is (d )(d2)()n 2. the generalization of eq. (3.10) will have on its r.h.s.
cn g14n 3n nf
times similar spacetime dependent factors. we have not worked
out the numerical constant cn .

19

3.5. local form of the anomaly

the local version of eq. (1.3) is obtained by applying the susy variation of the
elds only at the point x = z. to this end, one multiplies the l.h.s. of eqs. (2.2)
and (2.5) by 4(x  z). one can now repeat the construction of sec. 2. an easy
way to read the local variations from those of sec. 2.1 is to associate the 4(x  z)
factor with the matrix . whenever   occurs inside some integral, it is replaced
by the corresponding integrand at x = z. for the local variations of the collective
coordinates one obtains

m(z) = c 1

mn(cid:26)b

;n(z)  (z) + igz d4x b

;n(x) t a (x) a(x; z)(cid:27) ,

where

a(x; z) = f 1

;m(y) t b (y) c 1

;n(z)  (z) .

(3.34)

(3.35)

the variation of the measure is zero as before, and the local form of eq. (1.3) reads



d s(z) oe = contact terms z dn
where the contact terms are the expected variations of the (multi)local operator o.
the last term in eq. (3.36) is, by denition, a matrix element of the operator  s(z).
another way of reaching these results is to keep track of the diagrammatic identities
of sec. 3.2, but now without performing the integral in eq. (3.18). for the local form
of eq. (3.10) we nd

n (cid:16)esclw1w2 hn(z) oi(cid:17) ,

where the matrix element of  s(z) is

eq. (3.38) is consistent with locality of  s(z). as expected, one recovers the r.h.s.
of eq. (3.10) by integrating over z in eq. (3.38).

3.6. renormalization group considerations

at the next-to-leading order, the hilbert-space surface term on the last row of
eq. (3.13) may pick up logarithmic corrections. depending on the power of log , the
result of the   0 limit could blow up, remain nite, or vanish.
in fact, the logarithmic corrections may be either log  or log y2. this is because
the limit in eq. (3.13) is not uniform: while the eective range of the x0-integration

20

scales to zero with , the distance scale y2 is kept xed. taking this delicate point
into consideration, we now give a renormalization-group (rg) argument that the log 
factors arising from  and o i
 should cancel those arising from two-loop bubble
diagrams.

given a renormalization point , we rewrite eq. (3.10) to one higher order as

the reason for including the g5() factor in eq. (3.39) is as follows. first, the op-
erator  is rg-invariant because the collective coordinate  is independent of the
renormalization point , and the susy variation  respects rg-invariance. more
generally, the basic building blocks of rg-invariant operators are gf and g (or
g). we have therefore multiplied o i
 (0) and (y) by appropriate powers of g().
we now analyze the expected log  corrections, starting with the contribution of
the two-loop bubble diagrams [2]. the semi-classical instanton measure (3.9) involves
the product 6
2 g4(). rg invariance requires that, for size- instantons, the loga-
rithms arising from the bubble diagrams should turn this product into 6
2 g4(1).
next consider the operator . as can be seen from eqs. (3.14) and (3.15), the cou-
pling constant explicitly contained in  is associated with the classical eld. the
logarithmic corrections to  should modify that g() to g(1).

g()

finally, rg invariance of g3o i

 means that the exponential involving its anoma-
lous dimension, exp[r g(1)
dg o(g)/(g)], must be proportional to g3(1)/g3().
in other words, the renormalization of o i
 provides log  factors which are just enough
to turn g3() into g3(1). putting together the expected log  factors arising from
all sources we nd that they cancel each other. (of course, it is important to conrm
this conclusion by a direct next-order calculation.) moreover, all higher-order correc-
tions to both o(g) and (g) cannot give rise to log  terms in the solution of the rg
equation.

finally, if the scale y2 is varied, one expects the renormalization of (y) to
generate log y2 factors that turn g2() into g2(|y|1). we thus expect the next-order
result to be

sectors with additional instanton-antiinstanton pairs should be damped compared

4. the   0 limit

the limit of a vanishing-size instanton,   0, may be singular in correlation
functions that involve operators of suciently high dimension.
in this section we
investigate several aspects of this limit. our main result (subsection 4.1) is that the
anomalous ward identity eq. (3.10) cannot be modied by non-perturbative subtrac-
tions and, hence, constitutes a supersymmetry anomaly. in subsection 4.2 we discuss
point splitting, and explain why it does not regularize the operator o i
 occurring in
eq. (3.10). in subsection 4.3 we describe an ambiguity that arises in a case where
point splitting can be used and comment on its implications. in subsection 4.4 we
explain how the anomaly should arise on the lattice.

4.1. non-perturbative subtractions

in this subsection we rst examine separately the two correlators h( o i

 ) i
and ho i
 ( )i, whose dierence is eq. (3.10). we show that the corresponding
-integrals are convergent in the limit   0.
for comparison, we next consider another ward identity where the corresponding
in that case non-perturbative subtractions are
integrals are divergent for   0.
needed, and may in fact be used to recover susy. having worked out this explicit
example, we list the general properties of non-perturbative subtractions. it then easily
follows that eq. (3.10) cannot be modied by any non-perturbative subtraction.

in subsection 3.1 we have computed the correlation function h( ) o i

 (0) (y)i
(eq. (3.13)) in the limit   0. let us now generalize the calculation to any . the
operator product on the l.h.s. of eq. (3.16) may be written as 2sc(y; .) ind(y; )

this integral is convergent, with the main contribution to it arising from 2  y2.
for small 2/y2, the integrand in (4.5) behaves like y/(y2)4.

claim that both the small- and the large- behavior of the corresponding integrals is
the same as in eq. (4.5) above. in the limit    this can be established simply on di-
mensional grounds. turning to the   0 limit we rst examine h( o i
 (0)) (y)i.
at tree level, if the product of zero modes at the point y is sc(y) ss(y) then the
presence of y/(y2)4 is evident and, on dimensional grounds, implies a y/(y2)4 be-
havior of the -integrand. alternatively, if one places both superconformal modes
 (0)ix0,, is zero
because the x0-integral is odd (compare eq. (3.17)). the rst non-zero contribution
again goes like y/(y2)4. at the one-loop level one reaches the same conclusion by
examining the (small- behavior of the) fermion propagator in the relevant partial
wave. having established this (large- and) small- behavior of h( o i
 (0)) (y)i,
eqs. (4.3) to (4.5) imply the same behavior for the -integrand in ho i
 (0) ( (y))i.
(reaching this conclusion directly is more dicult: the correlator involves a diagram
with a vector-boson propagator connecting the points 0 and y, and in an instanton
background this propagator decreases very slowly [12]; see, however, ref. [15].)

at the point y then the factorized y-independent piece, r d4x0 h o i

before turning to the physical implications of eq. (3.10), we wish to explain in

operator f . note that eq. (4.6) exhibits a y7 fall-o which is faster than the
y5 fall-o in eq. (3.10). this kinematic dierence will turn out to play an important
role.

we now show that the operator f 3

we have chosen a manifestly non-supersymmetric subtraction. the nite, last term
in eq. (4.10) was chosen to cancel the r.h.s. of eq. (4.6). using the vacuum-sector
result

(4.12)

eq. (4.6) becomes

d[. f 3

ijk(0)] f (y) + [f 3

eq. (4.12) means that susy has been recovered in the limit   0 after perform-
ing the above non-perturbative subtractions. moreover, by considering additional
ward identities, one can verify that the renormalized operators respect the susy
algebra. (recovering the supermultiplet structure of composite operators by suitable
subtractions is a reminiscent of the so-called konishi anomaly [9].)

there are two lessons from the above example. first, when non-perturbative
subtractions play a role, there is at least a chance that susy will be recovered. the
other lesson has to do with the general properties of non-perturbative subtractions. a
divergence at   0 always arises from a kinematic situation where the instanton sits
on top of an operator o(x) of a suciently high dimension. consider the instanton-
sector correlation function ho(x)qk ok(yk)i and assume that a   0 divergence
arises only from the operator o(x). the zero modes and the propagators which are
functions of y1, y2, . . . , become -independent in the limit   0. (more generally,
they are expandable in powers of ; this expansion is used when the leading divergence
is stronger than log .)

as a result, the dependence on spacetime points of the   0 divergence must be
that of a vacuum-sector correlation function ho(x)qk ok(yk)ivac involving another
operator o(x). the operators o(x) and o(x) must have the same quantum numbers
except for their chiral charge, where the mismatch is given by the number of fermionic
zero modes. because of the explicit 6
1 factor which appears in instanton-sector
correlation functions, the dimension of o must be smaller than that of o at least
by 6. (the dierence between the dimensions of o(x) and o(x) is 6 (for su(2)) if
the divergence is logarithmic; if the divergence goes like some inverse power of , the
dierence is 6 plus that power.)

 (0)) (y)i and ho i

previously, we showed that there is no small- divergence in the correlation func-
tions h( o i
 (0) ( (y))i. it is now easy to generalize this
result, and show that no instanton-sector correlation function can have a   0 diver-
gence associated with the operators o i
 . if such a divergence were to arise
in some correlation function, then from the spacetime dependence of the divergence

 or o i

24

one could read o what is the necessary non-perturbative subtraction. however, there
is no operator that qualies as a non-perturbative subtraction for o i
 or for o i
 .
the mass dimension of o i
 is 7.5. therefore, for the subtraction one would need an
operator whose dimension is 7.5  6 = 1.5. evidently, there is no gauge invariant
operator with this dimension. a similar conclusion applies to o i
 . since eq. (3.10)
cannot be modied by any non-perturbative subtraction, there is no way to recover
that susy ward identity. hence, eq. (3.10) constitutes a supersymmetry anomaly.

one may wonder how the physical implications of eqs. (3.10) and (4.6) can be
so dierent. apart from the above mentioned kinematic dierence (y7 vs. y5 fall-
o), there are two more signicant dierences between the two ward identities. in
eq. (4.6), only the fermionic zero modes and the classical eld occur on both sides. as
shown in ref. [7], the collective coordinates and the fermionic zero modes constitute a
nite supersymmetric system. one does not expect that susy will be violated when
these are the only relevant degrees of freedom. on the other hand, in eq. (3.10) the
l.h.s. involves one-loop diagrams which are outside the scope of the supersymmetric
calculus of ref. [7], and the potential for an anomaly exists.

the other qualitative dierence between eqs. (3.10) and (4.6) is in the corre-
sponding local ward identities.
in the case of eq. (4.6), the   0 limit and the
integration over the point z, where the susy variation is performed, do not com-
mute. ignoring irrelevant constants, the product sc(z) a/(z) which occurs in
.(z), is 2z2/(z2 + 2)4. this becomes a delta-function, 4(z), in the limit   0.
as a result, the corresponding local matrix element is zero except for z = 0. when
the only violation of the naive ward identity is of this type, it is natural to associate
this eect with a modication of the composite-operator transformation rule, and not
with a non-zero  s(z).

in contrast, the local form of eq. (3.10) (namely eq. (3.38)) is non-zero for any
z. moreover, after the z-integration one recovers eq. (3.10), hence the z-integration
and the   0 limit commute. this result is incompatible with  s(z) = 0.
4.2. on point splitting

 and o i

in this subsection we address the following question: what happens if one at-
tempts to dene the operators o i
 involves
three gaugino elds, splitting o one of these elds requires the introduction of a par-
allel transporter to maintain gauge invariance. our nding are: (a) point splitting
does not regularize these operators but, rather, introduces new divergences; (b) in
the instanton sector, the   0 anomalous term of eq. (3.10) is traded with another
anomalous term arising from the susy variation of the parallel transporter (whose
evaluation is technically much more complicated).

 via point splitting? since o i

for our purpose it is enough to consider the following partial point splitting
 (x, ) =(cid:16) deb
o i
where

(x))(cid:17) u ef (x, x + )(cid:16)( d2)f g g(x + )(cid:17) ,

x

dt exp(cid:18)igz t

x

ds a(cid:19) ( a(t)) exp(cid:18)igz x+

t

ds a(cid:19) .

(4.15)

let us now replace u by  u in eq. (4.13). the  eld arising from  a of eq. (4.15)
may be contracted with any one of the three  elds in eq. (4.13). for at least one
of them, the contraction involves same-color elds and, hence, is given in the short-
distance limit by a free propagator. this free propagator gives rise to a quadratic
divergence in the t  x (or t  x + ) limit at nite  > 0.
it is well known that point splitting may be used as a (gauge invariant) regular-
ization in cases such as the chiral anomaly and the konishi anomaly [9]. what is
common to these examples is that the gauge (and gaugino) elds are external, and
only matter elds are integrated over. when one integrates over the gauge and the
gaugino elds too, point splitting ceases to provide a regularization as demonstrated
above.

what happens if, nevertheless, one attempts to use the denition (4.13) in the
instanton sector with some other method of regularization (e.g. dimensional regu-
larization)? when the three s are not at the same point the -integrand is less
singular, and behaves qualitatively as

for some n  2. the new denominator (2 + 2)n arises from the (possibly dieren-
tiated) wave function of the zero mode at x = . the numerator 2n corresponds
to the same wave function in the limit 2  0 where eq. (4.3) should be recovered.
consequently expression (4.5) is replaced by

y

 (h(2/y2)  2

2 > 0 ,

(4.17)

the   0 surface term thus vanishes for 2 > 0. in its place, there is now a new
anomalous term, the one arising from the variation of the parallel transporter (4.15).
after factoring out the leading y/(y2)3 dependence (and handling the new divergences
described above!), one is left with an integral over the dimensionless variable 2/2. in
this integral, the parallel tranporters of eq. (4.15) (with a taken to be the classical
eld) are o(1) and may not be approximated by any truncation of their taylor series.
the resulting integrals a very complicated and we did not pursue this calculation any
further.

and the approximation 2, 2  y2 was made on the second row. the result in now
ambiguous. it depends on the behavior of the ratio / in the limit. if we send   0
before   0, eq. (3.10) is recovered. on the other hand, if we rst send   0 and
only later   0, then the integrand on the second row behaves like a delta-function,
(), and the result is zero. more generally, if we take the limit with some xed ratio
/, then 2/(2 + 2) will interpolate smoothly between 0 and 1.

we have not been able to resolve this ambiguity in a completely satisfactory way,
but we have several comments. first, if this problem could not be resolved, this would
mean an ambiguity in the physical predictions of the theory. the latter conclusion
seems to us highly unlikely.

we thus assume that a resolution of the ambiguity should exist. the obvious
next question is what eect does this have on the susy anomaly. our conclusion is
that the susy anomaly exists regardless of what one does about that ambiguity. we
will soon argue that, in fact, the prescription of sending   0 after   0 violates
physical principles. nevertheless, suppose momentarily that that prescription was

27

correct. eq. (4.21) would then hold, namely the ward identity involving o i
 would
not be anomalous. however, o i
 are related only though the (ultimately
quantum) equation of motion. the latter is evidently broken by the prescription
leading to eq. (4.21). thus, even if one adopted that prescription, the anomalous
ward identity with o i
 , eq. (3.10), would still stand, with the conclusion that a
susy anomaly exists.

 and o i

in a renormalizable quantum eld theory, contributions from the cuto scale are
normally associated with some (logarithmic or power-law) divergence. the diver-
gences are canceled by counterterms, and the ambiguity in the nite parts of the
counterterms is xed by renormalization conditions.

in contrast, the ambiguity we encounter here if of a new type. we nd a -
nite contribution of a varying magnitude, coming from an innitesimal neiborhood
of the lower end of the -integral. (in other words, from instantons whose size is
as small as the short-distance cuto.) moreover, these undetermined short-distance
contributions cannot be attributed to dierent subtraction schemes, simply because
(subsection 4.1) they cannot be modied by any subtraction! this state of aairs
contradicts the principles of renormalization and universality. the only way to avoid
this problem is to adopt the (unique) prescription where these (otherwise undeter-
mined) contributions vanish. this prescription amounts to sending   0 before
  0 (equivalently /  0). as expected, in this case the ward identities for o i
and o i
4.4. susy and the lattice

 agree when the cuto is removed.



it is well-known that susy is broken by the lattice regularization. arguments
that susy may be recovered in the continuum limit were put forward in ref. [16].
these arguments are valid in the context of weak-coupling perturbation theory on
the lattice. however, as we now explain, they do not cover non-perturbative eects.
in the appropriate momentum (or distance) range, the susy anomaly should
arise on the lattice exactly as in our continuum treatment. the relevant distance
range is dened by a2/y2  0 where a is the lattice cuto, and y66
1  1 but nite.
this scaling region, which would be probed in deep-inelastic scattering, is controlled
by a small coupling constant. the leading dynamical eect in that region is the
logarithmic evolution of the coupling constant. this is covered by weak-coupling
perturbation theory (both in the continuum and on the lattice).

in the scaling region, non-perturbative eects can be studied systematically on the
lattice just like in the continuum, because they are controlled by the small parameter
exp(82/g2(|y|1)). what needs to be done analytically is to repeat the construction
of the instanton-sector path integral given in appendix b, but now on the lattice.
while to our knowledge this was never done in any detail, we stress that there is no
conceptual diculty here. in fact, the continuum change-of-variables (appendix b.2)
is a formal manipulation, because so is the original path-integral measure in terms of
position eigenstates. in contrast, the corresponding change-of-variables on the lattice
should be completely well dened (albeit technically more involved).

28

we recall that, in any non-perturbative sector, the collective coordinates are de-
termined by listing the (exact or approximate) bosonic zero modes, that must be re-
moved from the uctuations spectrum to avoid infra-red divergences. the instanton-
sector path integral on the lattice will, obviously, feature the same set of collective
coordinates as in the continuum treatment. the anomalous susy ward identity,
eq. (3.10), will thus arise also within the above-sketched analytic lattice treatment of
the instanton sector. (of course, this applies also to the more general result, eq. (1.3).)
it is interesting to re-examine the ambiguity of the previous subsection in a lattice

context. on the lattice the instanton action is

f (/a) ,

(4.24)

where g0 is the bare lattice coupling. the function f (/a) accounts for the lattice-
induced change in the instanton action when its size  becomes very small. first,
identifying  of the previous subsections with the lattice cuto a, the above advo-
cated /  0 prescription means that the lattice action should be chosen such that
f (/a) >
 1 for /a  1 [17]. this condition implies that the minimal instanton size,
while being vanishingly small in physical units, is innitely large in lattice units in
the continuum limit. (typically, f (/a) is a polynomial in a/. if f (/a)  (a/)2n,
unsuppressed instantons will be ones with   a g1/n
the opposite prescription, namely /  , corresponds on the lattice to choos-
ing f (/a) to be negative for /a  1. this means that the probability of nding
lattice-size instantons is enhanced. in numerical simulations this enhances lattice arte-
facts in physical quantities, which is undesirable. more seriously, this may become a
problem of principles as we now explain.

as discussed earlier, the matrix elements of the point-split operator o i

 gener-
ically contain a piece that behaves like a delta-function (). suppose now that
lattice-size instantons are not suppressed. when their boltzmann weight is multi-
plied by the eective (), a non-zero contribution to the ward identity involving
o i
is obtained even in the (would-be) continuum limit g0  0. as before, this
contribution depends on the precise denition of o i
 but, moreover, it now violates
lorentz invariance. the reason is that it originates from lattice-size instantons which
must be sensitive to the orientation of the lattice axes. (as a by-product, the susy
ward identity for o i
in fact, the boltzmann weight of lattice-size instantons must either diverge or
vanish in the limit g0  0. (it cannot stay nite without innite ne-tuning.) we
conclude that, as a matter of principle, when the ambiguity of subsection 4.3 arises,
there will exist a consistent continuum limit only if the lattice action is chosen such
that lattice-size instantons are suppressed. as in the previous continuum treatment,
the ward identities for o i
 will then agree in the continuum limit of the
lattice theory, and will both be anomalous.

5. conclusions

in this paper we have derived a general expression for the anomalous term in
susy ward identities (eq. (1.3)). we have analyzed in detail ward identities in the
one-instanton sector of su(2) susy theories. we have found non-zero anomalous
terms, which moreover cannot be modied by subtractions, both in sym (eq. (3.10))
and in susy theories with matter (eq. (3.32)).

the susy anomaly arises from a hilbert-space surface term, unlike the chiral
anomaly which arises from non-invariance of the path-integral measure. in the susy
case there seem to be no analog of the familiar anomaly-cancelation mechanism of
the chiral anomaly. similar anomalous ward identities should exist with an su(n)
gauge group (subsection 3.4), and with any matter content. this would imply that
the susy anomaly occurs in every asymptotically-free four-dimensional theory.

within a fully non-perturbative regularization (such as a lattice cuto) the op-
erator  s is necessarily non-zero. in the continuum limit, all matrix elements of
 s vanish to all orders in perturbation theory but, according to our results,  s
has non-perturbative matrix elements which are not zero. as a crucial check, this
should be conrmed by a calculation which starts directly from the non-zero  s of
the regularized theory.

locality of  s in the regularized theory implies its locality in the continuum
limit. the local version of the anomalous ward identity (eq. (3.38)) is consistent
with this requirement. in eq. (3.38) the correlation between the points 0 and z must
be mediated by a bosonic state. the z-dependence, namely z/(z2)2, is that of (the
derivative of) a massless boson propagator. however, the apparent single-particle
propagation could also be due to two colinear particles. usually the phase space for
colinear propagation is zero, but in the triangle diagram the fermion and the anti-
fermion do in fact become colinear in a special kinematic limit [22]. whether a similar
phenomenon takes place in the present case is another important question. finally,
the implications of this new anomaly on the physical spectrum of susy theories
should be studied.

eld b i(x). we use a real notation where the generic index i runs over the gauge
eld a and over both scalar elds  and their complex conjugates . one has

b i  a ,  ,  ,
b i  a ,  ,  ,
 i   ,  ,  ,

(a.2)

where  stands for all scalar elds in the theory. for the fermions we employ a
majorana-like notation [18] which is valid in vector-like susy theories, such as sqcd.
for each pair of weyl fermions in complex conjugate representations l, l
c we dene
 = (l, l

c , l). we then write

c ), c = (l

where  is the (majorana eld) gaugino. we will also use the notation

 i(x)   ,  , c ,

q i(x) = b i(x) + q i(x)

(a.3)

(a.4)

where q i(x) stands for any quantum eld, boson or fermion, and with the under-
standing that b i(x) = 0 for fermions (since there is no classical fermion eld). the
notation (x) will be used as a shorthand for the mode expansion of the fermion
elds, cf. eq. (2.1).

we introduce a real inner product, dened for given values b(1)

i

and b(2)

i

of the

bosonic elds as

(b(1)

i |b(2)

 a(2)

i ) z d4x (cid:16)a(1)
i ) z d4x (cid:16)(1) (2) +x(cid:16)(1) (2)

 +x(cid:16)(1)(2) + (2)(1)(cid:17)(cid:17) .
c (cid:17)(cid:17) .

c + (2) (1)

the sum is over all scalar elds. for fermions the inner product is

((1)

i |(2)

(a.5)

(a.6)

here  = t cconj etc., where cconj is the charge-conjugation matrix. finally, the
inner product of two adjoint-representation elds (e.g. the last term in eq. (2.7)) is
simply the integral of their product.

the susy variation of any boson is linear in the fermions. we write this as

follows

the index  runs over all supersymmetries (i.e. we do not distinguish here between
 and ).

b i =  i j j .

b. transverse-eld feynman rules

in this appendix we derive feynman rules for any non-perturbative sector of
a weakly-coupled, renormalizable gauge theory. we restrict the discussion to the
background landau gauge. both gauge and scalar classical elds will be considered.
we face two technical problems. first, we are dealing with a coupled quantization
problem, involving both (discrete) collective coordinates and (innitely many) gauge
degrees of freedom. this was discussed in the literature before, see e.g. [19, 20]. the
second complication arises because we do not assume that the background eld is
a solution of the classical eld equations. many relations used in the quantization
around an exact solution do not apply here.

the below feynman rules do not involve constraints [21]. as a result there are
linear (classical tadpole) terms in the action. the latter can be treated perturbatively
provided the background eld is an approximate solution of the classical equations.
(verication of the last statement must be done on a case by case basis. we will
discuss the one-instanton sector of susy-higgs theories elsewhere.)

this appendix is organized as follows. in subsection b.1 we dene the background
gauge. quantization in a given non-perturbative sector is discussed in subsection b.2.
the mode expansion of the quantum elds, and various commutator formulae, are
given in subsection b.3. in subsection b.4 we give a compact formula for the path in-
tegral, which treats the ordinary collective coordinates and the innitely-many gauge
degrees of freedom on a uniform basis. this formula provides the basis for the discus-
sion in sec. 2. in subsection b.5 we dened the ghost action, and in subsection b.6
we complete the feynman rules by giving explicit formulae for the functional de-
terminants and the tree-level propagators. finally, in subsection b.7 we explain a
complication that arises when one attempts to go to a general -gauge.

b.1. background gauge

we work in the background gauge whose explicit form will be repeatedly used.
we rst record the action of a gauge transformation parametrized by a(x) on the
classical eld(s)

ac
 = dab
 b ,
a = ig t a
ab b a ,



a = ig 

b t a

ba a ,

where

is the background covariant derivative. in compact notation this reads

d =   igaa

t a ,

b i(x)  a

i (b(x)) a(x) ,

(b.1)

(b.2)

(b.3)

where a
i is a linear dierential operator that maps the lie-algebra valued function
a into the space of all (classical) bosonic elds. for each target bose eld, the action
of a

i can be read o from eq. (b.1).

32

the quantum elds transform homogeneously. in particular, c

(x) transforms in
bc = ifabc. we summarize all the transformation
(b.4)

the adjoint representation, with t a
rules by

the background gauge is dened by

q = (a  igt a q)a .
 + igx(t a  t a) = 0 .

 b

a

i

 i = dab

(b.5)

(b.6)

(b.7)

(b.8)

the classical eld depends on the collective coordinates. in general, the ordinary n-
derivatives of the classical eld b,n = b/n do not obey the background gauge. we
introduce covariant n-derivatives by making a compensating gauge transformation

b;n = b,n + aa
n ,

where a

n is dened by imposing the background gauge condition(s)

a solution a

n always exists, since

a b;n = 0 .

lab

gh  ab = (d2)ab +x {t a, t b} ,

is a positive operator. under a gauge transformation, b;n transforms homogeneously.
we dene second (or higher) covariant derivatives of the classical eld via e.g.

b;n;m = b;n,m  igt ab;n a
m .

(b.9)

b.2. quantization

formally, the path integral is dened in terms of position eigenstates, and has the
measure db(x)d(x). quantization in a non-perturbative sector means a change
of variables at the price of introducing a jacobian. the new variables include the
collective coordinates n, the amplitudes of the quantum modes, and the gauge degrees
of freedom a(x) which decouple later. the change of variables is facilitated by
introducing the following identity into the path integral

1 = z dnz d(x) j

ym
yx,a

h(u b;m|b()  u b)i
h u a(cid:16)b()(x)  u b(x)(cid:17)i .

(b.10)

here b()(x) denotes a nite gauge transformation of the bosonic elds generated
by exp(iga(x)). the role of the rst delta-function is to remove the innitesimal
variations b;n from the uctuations spectrum, and to trade them with collective coor-
dinates. the second delta-function xes the gauge, as in the standard faddeev-popov
procedure.

33

a frequently encountered technical problem is that one obtains ordinary n-
derivatives in the jacobian, and their replacement by covariant n-derivatives requires
some justication [19]. we overcome this problem by considering a
n(x; ) as
a connection on the space spanned by the collective coordinates. we introduce a
parallel transporter on this space

n = a

u(x; ) = p exp igz 

dsn a

n t a! ,

(b.11)

where p denotes path ordering and the integration runs along some path from the
origin to . in eq. (b.10) u b(x) denotes the action of the nite gauge transformation
dened by u on b(x), and u a = a(u b(x)).
in the computation of the jacobian j, one must remember that b(x) and a(x)
are independent of the collective coordinates. the -dependence enters through
b = b(x; ) and u = u(x; ). thanks to the presence of u we obtain covariant
n-derivatives everywhere. one has
u,n = ig u t aa

n() + path dependent terms ,

(b.12)

where the rst term on the r.h.s. comes from the variation of the end point. by choos-
ing a sequence of paths judicious, the path dependent terms vanish in the limit [18].
after computing the n-derivatives we set b()  u b = u . all the u factors, as
well as the explicit a(x)-dependence, drop out now. the generalized faddeev-popov
jacobian is

j = det

where c = c0 + c1 and

cmn

igb

;n(x)t a (x)

a(x)(cid:16)b(x)  igt b (x)(cid:17) 4(x  y) 

;m(y)t b (y)

(c0)mn = (b;m|b;n) ,
(c1)mn = (b;m| ;n) = (b;m;n| ) .

(b.13)

(b.14a)

(b.14b)

in the derivation of eq. (b.13) we have also used eq. (b.7) and (a);m = igt ab;m.
the matrix c is symmetric. for c0 this is obvious. for c1 this follows using the
commutation relations of the next subsection and eq. (b.5).

we may now evaluate the delta-functions in eq. (b.10). the rst delta-function
removes the b;n modes from the bosonic uctuations, yielding a factor of det 1
2 (c0).
similarly, the second (functional) delta-function removes the longitudinal modes and
yields a factor of det 1

2 (lgh). the partition function thus reads

z =z dn d q

j

det

2 (c0) det

exp(s) ,

(b.15)

where d q = d  d . the quantum bosonic eld obeys the gauge-xing condi-
tion (b.5) and
(b.16)

(b;m| ) = 0 .

34

b.3. mode expansion and commutators

we now turn to a more detailed discussion of the functional measure. d  d 
is dened by expanding each boson and fermion quantum-eld in eigenmodes of the
corresponding small uctuations operator in the classical background. repeating
eq. (2.1) one has

q(x) =xpz p(x)qp ,

(b.17)

where qp denotes the amplitude of any quantum mode, and p(x) is the corresponding
eigenfunction. in the case of fermions, the mode expansion includes both the zero
modes and the continuum modes. in the case of bosons there are usually only contin-
uum modes. (however, the formalism can accommodate discrete bosonic modes too,
should any survive after the removal of the b;n(x) modes.)

anticipating the need for ghost elds a(x) and a(x) (subsection b.5 below) we

also give their mode expansion

a(x) =xpz ca

p(x)p ,

a(x) =xpz ca

p(x)p ,

(b.18)

where the ca
which are eliminated by the background gauge are k

p(x) are the (real) eigenfunctions of lab

gh. the longitudinal bosonic modes

p(x)  aca

p(x).

the small uctuations operators depend on the collective coordinates through the
classical eld. through the eigenfunctions, this implies dependence of the quantum
elds too on the collective coordinates. the n-derivative of a quantum eld is

q,n(x) =xpz p,n(x)qp .

covariant n-derivative are dened by

q;n = q,n  igt a q a
n ,

(b.19)

(b.20)

and similarly for the ghost eld.

we will also need various commutators. first, the commutator of two covariant

derivatives of the classical eld is

where

b;m;n  b;n;m = af a

mn ,

f a
mn = c

m,n  c

n,m + gfabc a

n b

m .

(b.21)

(b.22)

including the commutator for any quantum eld this reads (compare eq. (b.4))

q;m;n  q;n;m = (a  igt a q)f a

mn ,

(b.23)

in agreement with our interpretation of a
-space.

n as the components of a connection in

35

next we consider the commutator of a covariant n-derivative and a gauge trans-
formation. the local parameter of the gauge transformation is identied with a ghost
eigenstate, a(x) = ca
p(x) is a function of the
collective coordinates, one has

p(x) (see the next subsection). since ca

where

(q);n  (q;n) = (a  igt a q)f a

n = (;n)c = c

n .

(b.24)

(b.25)

(the above may also be applied to the improper gauge transformation that gener-
ates the isospin zero modes, see sec. 3.) finally, for the commutator of two gauge
transformations we have the familiar result

with

21q  12q = (a  igt a q)f a

12 ,

f c
12 = gfabc a

2b
1 .

(b.26)

(b.27)

b.4. uniform treatment of discrete and gauge collective coordinates

let us expand the local parameter of the gauge transformations a(x) in terms

of (its natural basis of) ghosts eigenstates

a(x) =xpz ca

p(x) p .

(b.28)

each (unnormalized) longitudinal mode aca
p(x) is the innitesimal variation of the
classical eld with respect to the gauge collective coordinate p. this observation pro-
vides the basis for a uniform treatment of all parts of the jacobian (b.13). taking the
inner product of the continuous-index terms with ghosts eigenstates (which amounts
to a unitary change of basis), the jacobian is rewritten as

j = det 

cmn
p);n| )
((aca

ig(b;m|t b |cb
q)
p|a(b  igt b )|cb
(ca

q) !

(b.29)

p);n a  = 0 by eq. (b.5). hence the lower-left entry in eq. (b.29)
notice that (ca
agrees with eq. (b.13). (we return to this observation in subsection b.7 below). the
jacobian now takes the compact form

j = detc ,

cm n = (c0)m n + (c1)m n ,

(c0)m n = (b;m|b;n) ,

(c1)m n = (b;m;n| ) .

(b.30)

(b.31)

(b.32)

the capital indices m,n stand for the discrete indices m, n that label the ordinary
collective coordinates, as well as for the indices p, q of the ghosts eigenstates, cf.

36

eq. (b.28) above. (e.g., for the classical eld one has explicitly b;m = b;m for m = m
and b;m = aca

p for m = p.) substituting eq. (b.29) into eq. (b.15) we obtain

z =z dn d q

(b.33)

eq. (b.33) provides the basis for the general discussion of sec. 2.

b.5. ghost action

we complete the denition of the feynman rules by giving expressions for the
functional determinants and for the tree-level propagators. in this subsection we dis-
cuss the ghost action. in a diagrammatic expansion, the discrete- and the continuous-
index parts of the jacobian (b.13) must be treated separately. given a general square
matrix

b21 b22 ! ,
one has det a = det b11det d where d = b22  b21b1
11 exists). applying
this formula to eq. (b.13) and introducing the ghost and the anti-ghost elds (x)
and (x), the jacobian (b.13) can be written as

a =  b11 b12

11 b12 (if b1

(b.34)

where the ghost action is

j = det c z dd  exp(sfp) ,
sfp =z d4xd4y a(x) f ab(x, y) b(y) ,
f ab(x, y) = f ab

where lab

gh is dened in eq. (b.8). the ghost propagator ggh is dened by

lgh ggh(x, y) = 4(x  y) .

next, the covariant derivatives b;m are o(1/g). hence, a systematic expansion for
c 1 (cf. eq. (b.39)) is obtained by writing
0  c 1

0 +    .

c 1 = c 1

0 c1 c 1

(b.41)

this may be represented in terms of discrete-ghost propagator and vertices, see fig. 1.
the feynman rules depicted in fig. 1 also generate the expansion of det (c/c0). the

b.6. propagators, functional determinants and interactions

the last step is to expand the bosonic elds in the action around the classical
background. one obtains terms containing any number of quantum elds between
zero (the classical action) and four. the interaction lagrangians are

lint

 l .

(b.44)

as explained earlier, the tadpole (linear) terms involving s(1)
i (b) = lb/b i arise
because we are not assuming that the background eld is an exact solution of the
classical equations.

the bilinear terms serve to dene the tree-level propagators and the functional
determinants for bosons and fermions. the semi-classical measure (including the
ghosts contribution) is

exp(w1) = det

2 (lf) .

(b.45)

the one-half power of the fermionic determinant is due to our majorana-like no-
tation (appendix a). as usual, exact zero modes are excluded from the fermionic
determinant. notice that, unlike in a general -gauge, we have here the ghosts deter-
minant to a one-half power. this is compensated by the absence of longitudinal-mode
contributions in the transverse bosonic determinant.

bosons. we now turn to a detailed discussion of the propagators and the functional
determinants, starting with the bosons. we focus on the propagator for those (gauge
and scalar) elds that have a classical value. (for bosonic elds that do not have a
classical part, the below derivation reduces to the textbook case, and the propagator
is the inverse of the dierential operator that occurs in the bilinear action.) let the
quadratic bosonic action be

s(2)
b (b, ) 

1
2

( |lb| ) .

(b.46)

the second-order dierential operator lb = lb(b) depends on the classical eld.
our task is to construct a bosonic propagator gb which is the inverse of lb on the
transverse subspace. the latter is the complement of the subspace spanned by the
b;n and by the innitely-many longitudinal modes. it is convenient to consider rst a
general -gauge, and then take the limit   0. this means that we rst project out
the nite-dimensional space spanned by the b;n for any , and in the end remove the
longitudinal modes by sending   0.

we begin by considering the dierential operator

l

b = lb +

1


aa ,

38

(b.47)

where the last term is the contribution of the gauge-xing action for  6= 0. when the
background eld is not a classical solution, l
b has no (exact) zero modes. therefore
it has an inverse gb such that

l
b

gb(x, y) = 4(x  y) .

(b.48)

we will now express gb in terms of gb and b;n. (the below construction is similar
to that of levine and yae [20], see also ref. [15].) we consider the bosonic gaus-
sian integration in the presence of an external source k(x) at xed values of the
collective coordinates n. we introduce a bosonic eld (x) which obeys the orthog-
onality conditions (b.16) but not the background gauge (b.5), as well as a completely
unconstrained eld (x). we let

denote the normalized covariant derivatives of the classical eld. now

the bosonic determinant is

(b.51)

(b.52)

where

mn = (bm| gb|bn) .

(b.53)
the bosonic determinant in eq. (b.45) is the   0 limit of eq. (b.52). (det(l
b)
contains an innite power of the gauge-xing parameter ; this power, which is for-
mally equal to the number of longitudinal modes, cancels against a matching innite
power upon dividing by the free vacuum-sector determinant.)

the last step is to take the landau-gauge limit   0. a very useful identity is
(b.59)

gghlb gb = ggh

 gb ,

which relates the longitudinal part of gb to the ghost propagator. eq. (b.59) is

 and integrating by parts. (if
derived by multiplying eq. (b.48) on the left by ggh
the classical eld is an exact solution, the longitudinal modes are zero modes of the
bosonic small uctuations operator and the l.h.s. of eq. (b.59) is zero; eq. (b.59) holds
in fact for gb too, as one can check using eq. (b.54) and  = 0.) eliminating the
gauge-xing term from eq. (b.48) using eq. (b.59), we rewrite the former as

lb gb(x, y) z d4z p k(x, z)lb gb(z, y) = 4(x  y)  p k(x, y) ,

(b.60)

where


 ,

p k(x, y) =  ggh(x, y)

(b.61)
is the longitudinal projector. eq. (b.60) holds for any , and has a smooth   0
limit. finally, substituting eq. (b.60) into eq. (b.54) we nd
lb gb = 1   gb  p k(1  lb gb)
= 1  (pb + p k)(1  lb gb) .

(b.62)

the last expression exhibits again that the covariant derivatives b;n and the longitu-
dinal modes have a similar role. this result is used in the diagrammatic identities
of appendix c.2. we comment that eqs. (b.57),
(b.60) and (b.62) all have the
generic form (1 p )l g = 1 p , which is the completeness relation for a constrained
propagator obeying p g = g p = 0.

( |lf | ) .

(b.63)

the euclidean dirac operator lf can be chosen to be hermitian [18].

in a generic susy theory that contains both explicit mass terms for matter elds
and a scalar vev, the fermion spectrum contains no exact zero modes, and lf has an
inverse gf such that lf gf (x, y) = 4(x  y). alternatively, if there are no explicit
mass terms, lf anti-commutes with the generator of some (typically anomalous) r-
symmetry even in the presence of a higgs eld. in a sector with a single classical
object (one unit of topological charge) the classical eld is spherically symmetric (or
can be chosen to be so, in case it is not an exact solution). this implies the existence
of a conserved index for each value of the total angular momentum. in this case the
fermion spectrum contains exact zero modes. one has

lf gf (x, y) = 4(x  y)  p exact

in general, the fermion propagator gf in the instanton sector contains a contri-
bution from approximate zero modes too. the latter correspond to those zero modes
of the exact instanton solution which couple through the explicit mass terms and/or
the higgs eld. for practical calculations, it may be convenient to separate out the
approximate zero modes. to this end one needs fermionic propagator and determi-
nant which are constrained to the complement of the subspace spanned by both exact
and approximate zero modes. these are dened via the same algebraic construction
used above for bosons.

for the general diagrammatic proof of susy ward identities (appendix c) it
is convenient to use the propagator gf . the projector on the exact fermionic zero
modes p exact
arises at intermediate steps in the derivation. however, the sum of all
terms involving p exact

is zero due to anti-symmetry.

recursion relations. a key role in the renormalization of (susy) ward identities
is played by recursion relations between the non-perturbative and free propagators.
let h = h0 + v be a schrodinger operator. assume that both h0 and h have no
zero modes, and let g0 and g be the corresponding green functions. one has the
textbook relation

g = (1  g v )g0 ,

(b.66)

which may be iterated a nite number of times. in our case, eq. (b.66) may be applied
to the ghost propagator (eq. (b.40)) and to the unconstrained bosonic propagator gb
(eq. (b.48)) for  6= 0.
the born series is obtained by iterating eq. (b.66) innitely many times. how-
ever, the series do not converge if h0 and h have dierent zero-modes spectra. thus,
a generalization of eq. (b.66) is needed for the fermion propagator gf which obeys
eq. (b.64). we rst write

b.7. the case  6= 0

as can be seen from the previous discussion, it is natural to work with a transverse
bosonic eld. since eq. (1.3) deals with gauge-invariant operators, it should hold for
any , and one may want to check this explicitly. however, there is a technical
diculty that has prevented us from generalizing the feynman rules to  6= 0.
as explained below eq. (b.29), one must use the gauge condition (b.5) in order
to prove that eqs. (b.13) and (b.29) dene the same jacobian. for  6= 0, however,
the constraint   = 0 is not respected. therefore, eqs. (b.13) and (b.29) do not
dene the same jacobian. we did not attempt to resolve the question of what is the
correct jacobian for  6= 0. (the gauge-xing constraint is used also in the calculation
of a, cf. eq. (2.8); therefore it is likely that a too will pick up terms proportional
to   for  6= 0. in the calculation of eq. (3.10) it is in fact possible to work with
any -gauge, since the above subtlety is relevant only at the next order.)

c. general diagrammatic proof of susy ward identities

in this appendix we give a general diagrammatic proof of eq. (1.3). the underlying
algebraic structure is similar to sec. 2. however, the bilinear part of the action plays
a special role, being the starting point for any diagrammatic expansion. as a result
things are technically more involved.

in more detail, besides algebraic manipulations, what entered the results of sec. 2
is the physical boundary conditions of the quantum elds. in a path-integral context
we had to invoke a nite-volume cuto in order to impose these boundary conditions.
however, the propagators automatically obey correct boundary conditions in innite
volume. therefore a diagrammatic expansion should be consistent with the vanishing
of s and  without having to resort to a nite-volume cuto.

c.1. no gauge elds

in this subsection we prove eq. (1.3) in the physically less interesting case of
(a non-perturbative sector of) a susy theory with no gauge elds. this simplies

42

matters in a number of ways. first, there is no need to introduce a ghost eld. in
addition we now deal with ordinary (in place of covariant) derivatives with respect to
the collective coordinates, which commute. expectation values are given by eq. (1.2),
which results after performing the integration over the quantum elds in eq. (b.33)
with c  c (cf. eqs. (b.14) and (b.31)). the semi-classical measure (eq. (b.45))
simplies to
(c.1)

2 (c0) det 1

2 (lf) .

2 (l

b) det

exp(w1) = det

the interaction terms arising from the action are given by eqs. (b.43) and (b.44).
additional vertices arise from the expansion of det (c/c0), cf. eq. (b.41).

the basic strategy is to construct separately ward identities for the various terms
in the transformation laws (2.10) and (2.11) of the quantum amplitudes. the nal
ward identity is obtained by piecing together the individual ward identities after
suitable arithmetical manipulations. we begin by considering all diagrams that dene
the expectation value of some (multi)local operator o, times an insertion of

(q|l|q) = ( |lb| ) + (|lf | ) ,

(c.2)

in each diagram we act with lb (lf ) on the propagator whose one leg corresponds to
 ( ) of eq. (c.2). using eqs. (b.54) and (b.64) we obtain the diagrammatic identity

|o
(q|l|q)o = (|1  p exact
   sf o) + ( |1   gb|x) .

(c.3)

(c.4)

and sb and sf are dened in eq. (3.20). the = sign denotes equality under the expec-
tation value dened by integrating over the quantum elds only. (this is an equality
between disconnected diagrams, which correspond to exp(w2) h  i in eq. (1.2).)
in eq. (c.3) cancel each other by antisymmetry.
using susy invariance of the action, as expressed in eq. (3.19), we nd

as in sec. 3, all terms with p exact

f

o = ( | gb|x)  ( |o tr

c 1) .

(c.5)

eq. (c.5) says that the xed- expectation value of o does not vanish because of
terms arising from the jacobian in eq. (b.33), or from the constraints obeyed by the
bosonic eld (eq. (b.16)), or from both. our task will be to simplify the r.h.s. of
eq. (c.5).

the hint comes from eqs. (2.10) and (2.11). these equations show that, besides
the expected piece arising from q, the variation of a quantum amplitude contains
additional pieces needed to compensate for the -dependence of the eld. we thus
proceed by writing down a diagrammatic identity for the variation 1 q(x)  n q,n(x)
(cf. eq. (b.19)). to this end, we consider the new insertion

1
2

nn..(q,n|l|q).. + ..(q|l|q,n)..o ,

43

(c.6)

where n is given by eq. (2.9) with c  c. the normal ordering prescription means
that the q and q,n must not be contracted with each other. we momentarily introduce
a nite volume cuto, which allows us to drop total derivatives of currents involving
q,n as in sec. 2. as before, we let l act on the propagator attached to the q-leg of the
insertion, and the resulting terms with p exact
cancel out. we obtain the diagrammatic
identity

where the -derivatives act on the (discrete) eigenvalues (compare eq. (2.20)). also
recall that each propagator has the mode expansion

(c.10)

eq. (c.10) holds in the innite-volume limit. on the third row, sint contains all the
interaction terms (that arise from the expansion of both the action and the jacobian).
the functional operator on that row dierentiates (the product of) all propagators in
a given diagram with respect to n. on the last row, f 0
i denote the exact fermionic
zero modes (see eq. (b.65)) and qf 0
are the corresponding grassmann amplitudes.
the role of the last row is to dierentiate all (exact) fermionic zero modes with respect
to n.

i

it may be helpful to examine the content of identity (c.10) in a simpler case,
where it is applied to a scalar eld that does not have a classical part. the second
and forth rows are then missing, and the identity reduces to the familiar relation

g,n(x, y) +z d4z g(x, z) l,n g(z, y) = 0 ,

44

(c.11)

which holds in any volume. as for the terms on the second and forth rows of
eq. (c.10), all of them involve localized sources which guarantee a smooth innite
volume limit. (at coinciding points, x = y, eq. (c.11) may however be violated by
the ultra-violet cuto (see subsection 3.3). if angular momentum cuto is employed,
the partial-wave propagators obey eq. (c.11) even for x = y. in that case the l.h.s.
of eq. (c.11) is formally ,n(0), and the spectral trace in eq. (2.33) may be regarded
as its integral.)

consider now the sum of eqs. (c.5) and (c.10). in order to arrive at eq. (1.3) we
need, besides -derivatives of the propagators, also -derivatives of all elements of the
feynman rules that depend explicitly (not through the eigenmodes) on the classical
eld. the latter must come from the r.h.s. of eq. (c.5) plus the rst two rows on the
r.h.s. of eq. (c.10). verifying that this is indeed the case is essentially an arithmetical
task. the reader who is not interested in these algebraic details is advised to skip
to subsection c.2, where we explain how we deal with the extra complications of a
gauge theory.

we start with the terms involving x in eqs. (c.5) and (c.10). writing  gb =

( gb  pb) + pb (cf. eq. (b.58)) we get

(   n ,n| gb|x) = n (b,n + dn|x) ,

where

(c.12)

(c.13)

dm = ((c0)mlln  mn) b,n

(b.44),

and ln is dened in eq. (b.56). we now consider the r.h.s. of eq. (c.12) term by
(3.20) and (c.4). first, b,n o/  = b,n o/b
term using eqs. (b.43),
since o = o(b + , ). this gives the -derivative of the classical part of o.
next (b i,n|s(1)
i (b)) = b,n s(0)/b gives the -derivative of the classical action, and
(b i,n|s(4)
 j
 k
next consider those terms in sb arising from eq. (b.43) and from the remain-
ing (the middle) term in eq. (b.44). combined with the rst term on the r.h.s. of
eq. (c.10) we nd

 l) gives b,n /b acting on s(3,b)

(c.14)

we used l i k,n = b j,n s(3)
i j k(b). including a one-half factor, this gives the logarithmic
-derivative of the functional determinants, except for those bosonic elds that have
a classical part, see below.

we next turn to the dn term in eq. (c.12). in the limit where the classical eld is
an exact solution, dn vanishes. (this can be worked out using appendix b.6.) in our
feynman rules, not having an exact classical solution is reected in the tadpole terms
and in the peculiar formulae for the bosonic propagator and determinant. we will
see that the dn-dependent terms are indeed related to those elements of the feynman
rules. first, similarly to eq. (c.12) we rewrite the second term on the second row of
eq. (c.10) as o times

 ( ,n| gb|(n)/ ) = (c 1

0 )ml(c1)ln(b,m|(n)/ )

+(cid:16)mn  (c 1

0 )mlcln(cid:17) (dm|(n)/ ) .(c.15)

45

the dn-dependent term in eq. (c.12) plus the rst term on the second row of eq. (c.15)
give

(dn|n x +

(n)

  o) = (b,n lb gb|n x +

(n)

  o)

= (b,n s(1)

i /b|  i)n o .

(c.16)

this is the -derivative of the classical source s(1)
i (b). the remaining dn-dependent
term in eq. (c.15) plus the r.h.s. of eq. (c.14) (for those elds that have a classical
part) give

2 (l

b) .

(c.17)

(note that the denition of the bosonic determinant (b.52) involves the normalized
modes of eq. (b.49).)

we are now left with three terms: the last term on the r.h.s. of eq. (c.5), o times

the rst term on the r.h.s. of eq. (c.15), and

n o(b,n| (c1)kl

  )c 1

lk = n o (b,n|b,k,l) c 1
lk ,

(c.18)

which is the last term that has remained from the r.h.s. of eq. (c.12). in order to
complete the derivation of eq. (1.3) we must show that the sum of these three terms
is equal to o times
(b,n|(n)/b) + n c 1

0 )lk(b,n|(c0)kl/b) . (c.19)

n (c 1

lk (b,n|ckl/b)

2

this expression amounts to b,n /b acting on (the logarithm of) the jacobian and
on n itself. the needed result follows after a few algebraic manipulations using the
commutativity of ordinary n-derivatives. this completes the diagrammatic proof of
eq. (1.3) for a susy theory that contains only scalar and fermion elds, and no gauge
elds.

c.2. gauge theories

before we turn to the full-edged diagrammatic proof of eq. (1.3) in a gauge
theory, there is one more exercise that we can do.
in the discussion of the previ-
ous subsection, let us make the (formal) replacement c  c, m, n  m,n etc (cf.
appendix b.4). in other words, we consider both the discrete and the continuous
collective coordinates. accordingly, we relax the assumption that n-derivatives com-
mute. repeating the entire derivation we now arrive at eq. (1.3), but with one extra
term which is left after the algebraic manipulations. this term is (o times) the
commutator from eq. (2.33).
the careful diagrammatic treatment of the boson and the fermion elds has con-
rmed the vanishing of the corresponding spectral traces in eq. (2.33). this is simply

46

because no such terms are left in the nal diagrammatic answer of subsection c.1.
now, as discussed in sec. 2, the commutator is really a spectral trace over the ghost
eld. as long as we treat the continuous-index part of the jacobian formally, we
cannot escape the appearance of this commutator. the full gauge-theory feynman
rules are needed in order to conrm the vanishing of the ghost-eld spectral trace.

the general strategy will be the same as in appendix c.1. we begin by establish-
ing a number of key diagrammatic identities which correspond to various pieces in the
transformation rules of the quantum amplitudes (2.10) and (2.11). the rest amounts
to very lengthy arithmetical manipulations that we omit. the gauge-theory partition
function is dened by eq. (b.42). the semi-classical measure is given by eq. (b.45).
the interaction lagrangians arising from the action are eqs. (b.43) and (b.44). the
ghosts lagrangian as well as the vertices arising from the discrete part of the jacobian
are given in appendix b.5.

the rst diagrammatic identity that we need is a generalization of eq. (c.5).
again we consider insertion (c.2). performing the same steps as in appendix c.1
and using eq. (b.62) we obtain

o = ( |(pb + p k)(1  lb gb)|x 
  ) o) ,

( |(tr

(c.20)

where x is dened in eq. (c.4) and the ghost interaction action sint
fp can be read
o from eqs. (b.36) and (b.39). on top of the r.h.s. of eq. (c.5), we see here the
contributions of the ghost action.

the second diagrammatic identity corresponds to the variation cov

following the same steps as in appendix c.1 we obtain

1 q(x)  n q;n(x).

as with eq. (c.10), the functional operator on the third row dierentiates all bosonic
and fermionic propagators with respect to n, while the last row does this for the
exact fermionic zero modes. for the -derivative of the ghost propagator we may use
(the covariant version of) the simpler relation eq. (c.11).

the last two identities correspond to the variation 2 q(x)  ig a(x) t a q(x).
this variation looks like a gauge transformation of the quantum elds, except that we
have replaced the local parameter a(x) by its susy variation a(x), see eq. (2.8).

(c.23)

with the above diagrammatic identities at hand, eq. (1.3) follows after lengthy
arithmetical manipulations which will not be repeated here. apart from similar steps
to those of appendix c.1, the commutator formulae (appendix b.3) play an impor-
tant role. in addition we use gauge invariance of the theory in general, and of the
operator o and the functional determinants in particular. (the detailed discussion
of sec. 3.2 provides a leading-order explanation on how eq. (1.3) works in a gauge
theory.)

d. translation invariance

it is instructive to see how translation invariance is proved using the general
formalism of sec. 2. let us dene q = q;. using eq. (2.2) one easily nds that the
translation collective coordinates x
. moreover,
all other collective and quantum variables are invariant. the corresponding ward
identity (cf. eq. (2.15)) for a gauge-invariant local operator reads

0 transform according to  x

0 = 

ho,i = z d4x0


x

0 hoix0 = 0 .

(d.1)

we see that the hilbert-space surface term coincides with a spacetime surface term,
which vanishes thanks to locality (and gauge invariance) of o.
let us now examine the local ward identity involving the conserved energy-
momentum tensor t (compare subsection 3.5). dene zq(x) = 4(x  z)q;(x).
now other collective coordinates besides x
0 transform as well. in particular, in the
one-instanton sector the scale collective coordinate  transforms to leading order as

(z) =

g2
162

ac
 (z)


f c
(z) .

48

(d.2)

using the explicit expressions for the instanton eld it easily follows that (z) is a
total z-derivative, whose integral is zero. suppose now that, for a given operator o,
the   0 surface term involving (z) is nite. being a total spacetime derivative,
this term can be absorbed into a redenition of the matrix element of t(z). (an
additional total spacetime derivative which is absorbed into the matrix element of
t(z) comes from the local variation of the measure.)

another diagram with an insertion of eq. (3.25). again, the second
diagram on the r.h.s. vanishes after a fiertz rearrangement, the third diagram is a
contribution to the -derivative of h( ) o i
 (0) (y)i, and the last diagram cancels
against other diagrams by gauge invariance.

figure 8: one-loop tadpole diagrams. the loop stands for the sum of boson, fermion
and ghost contributions. the rst diagram on the r.h.s. is a contribution to o. in
general, the third diagram gives the n-derivative of the logarithm of the functional
determinants.
in sym the functional determinants cancel each other exactly, and
accordingly the one-loop tadpole is zero. in the second diagram on the r.h.s., it is
convenient for our purpose to consider the contribution of each eld separately. the
fermion loop is by itself zero after a fiertz rearrangement. the boson loop appears
in fig. 9. the ghost loop cancels against a sum of diagrams with the longitudinal
projector, see text.

figure 9: the diagram on the r.h.s. is (2) (which makes a contribution to o).
the rst diagram on the l.h.s. is from fig. 7, and the second one from fig. 8.

figure 10: the third diagram gives the -derivative of (the classical eld contained
in) a covariant derivative d. the rst two diagrams contribute to o.

figure 11: diagrams containing the matrix c1 (eq. (b.14b)) from the discrete-index
part of the jacobian. the rst diagram on the r.h.s. is a contribution to o. the
second diagram gives the -derivative of the bosonic zero mode contained in  itself.
the third diagram gives the -derivative of log det
