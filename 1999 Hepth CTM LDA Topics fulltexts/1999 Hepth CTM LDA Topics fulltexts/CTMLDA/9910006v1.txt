abstract

the statistical origin of the entropy of charged black holes in models of induced
einstein-maxwell gravity is investigated. the constituents inducing the einstein-
maxwell action are charged and interact with an external gauge potential. this new
feature, however, does not change divergences of the statistical-mechanical entropy
of the constituents near the horizon.
it is demonstrated that the mechanism of
generation of the bekenstein-hawking entropy in induced gravity is universal and it
is basically the same for charged and neutral black holes. the concrete computations
are carried out for induced einstein-maxwell gravity with a negative cosmological
constant in three space-time dimensions.

1 introduction

the bekenstein-hawking entropy sbh is one of the most intriguing features of black holes.
it is generally believed that it is impossible to nd its statistical-mechanical explanation
in the framework of the classical einstein gravity. it is more likely that sbh hints to a
more fundamental theory of quantum gravity which provides black holes with microscopic
degrees of freedom. such a theory may be quite complicated, like the string theory. yet
one may expect that the mechanism of generation of sbh does not depend on the details
and is universal. one of the possibilities to understand this mechanism [1][6] is to use the
idea of sakharovs induced gravity [7]. sakharovs basic assumption is that the gravity
becomes dynamical as a result of quantum eects of constituent elds. in the models of
induced gravity the bekenstein-hawking entropy sbh of a black hole has the following
statistical-mechanical form

sbh = ssm  q .

(1.1)

here ssm is the statistical-mechanical (entanglement) entropy of the constituents located
near the horizon and q is the noether charge which appears because of non-minimal
couplings. relation (1.1) has been demonstrated for static [2][4] and rotating [6] black
holes in four space-time dimensions. these works however considered a pure induced
gravity and, hence, the black hole solutions had no charges. in a more realistic situation
one may expect that all other long-range elds are induced along with the gravitational
one on an equal footing. by extending in this way sakharovs assumption one could
model a fundamental theory which unies the gravity with other forces of the nature and
investigate a more general class of black holes.

the aim of the present paper is to consider an induced einstein-maxwell gravity, as
a simplest model of such a unied theory. in this picture, the graviton g and photon
a are not fundamental, and are collective excitations of the constituent elds. as we
will see, the constituents now are to be charged and interact with a as with an external
potential. the action for a is completely induced by the vacuum polarization and in
the low-energy limit it coincides with the maxwell action.
in principle, the additional
interaction of the constituents with the black hole electromagnetic eld at the horizon
can change the statistical entropy ssm . we show, however, that this interaction does not
aect the divergent part of ssm and in the low-energy limit relation (1.1) for charged black
holes preserve its form. thus, the mechanism of generation of the bekenstein-hawking
entropy by the constituents seems to be universal and not depending on the type of a
black hole.

to simplify the analysis we study induced einstein-maxwell gravity in three dimen-
sions, more exactly, the einstein-maxwell gravity with a negative cosmological constant.
the main interest to this theory is that it admits charged black holes [8],[9] and mim-
ics some properties of the four-dimensional theory. there are also other reasons which
motivate our choice. first, in three dimensions, one can easily construct induced gravity

2

models which are completely free from ultraviolet divergences while in four-dimensions
eliminating all the divergences becomes a complicated problem. second, a special class of
solutions in three-dimensional gravity are btz black holes [8] whose entropy admits an
alternative statistical representation in terms of a conformal eld theory [10].

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we construct a model of induced
einstein-maxwell gravity with negative cosmological constant in three-dimensional space-
time. the thermodynamics of charged black holes in this theory is discussed in section 3.
in section 4 we consider the properties charged elds near a charged black hole. we show
that for non-extremal black holes with a weak electric eld the gauge interaction near the
horizon slightly shifts the mass of a particle. this cause, however, a very little eect on
the density of energy levels of the eld. by using this result in section 5 we investigate the
statistical-mechanical origin of the bekenstein-hawking entropy of charged black holes in
three-dimensional induced einstein-maxwell gravity. our concluding remarks in section 6
concern charged black holes in four-dimensional induced einstein-maxwell gravity. some
details regarding computation of the induced action can be found in appendix.

2 induced einstein-maxwell gravity

the classical einstein-maxwell gravity is the theory of the interacting gravitational eld,
g, and the abelian gauge eld a. the corresponding (dieo- and gauge-invariant)
action is

1

4 z d3xg(cid:20) 1

4g

(r  2)  f f(cid:21)

i[g, a] =

.

(2.1)

we consider this theory in three dimensions. in (2.1), r is the scalar curvature dened
for the metric g, f = a  a is the maxwell strength tensor, g and  are
the gravitational (newton) and cosmological constants, respectively. if the cosmological
constant is negative, one of the solutions of (2.1) is anti-de sitter space-time. for this
reason and for the brevity we will call such a theory adsm-gravity (anti-de sitter-maxwell
gravity).

in the induced gravity approach action (2.1) is generated as an eective action for a
system of quantum constituents. constituents of our model are charged massive scalar
and spinor elds on the space-time with the metric g. the elds do not interact to each
other but interact to the gauge eld a. the theory is described by the quantum action

[g, a] = xs

wd[g, a] = i log det (d + md)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

at least some of scalars are non-minimally coupled with the corresponding constants s.
we have ns, scalars with masses ms and nd spinors with masses md. the covariant
derivative for the k-th constituent with the charge ek is

d =  + eka

.

(2.5)

note that in three dimensions a has the dimensionality of (mass)1/2 and, thus, the
elementary charges ek have a nontrivial dimensionality of (mass)1/2.

the theory (2.2) in three dimensions has a very important property. it is completely
free from the ultraviolet divergences if the parameters of the model subject to the con-
straints (see appendix)

2ns  2nd = 0 , 2xs

s  2xd

m2

d = 0 , 2ns + nd  12xs

s = 0 .

(2.6)

in three dimension the spinors have two components and for this reason equations (2.6)
coincide with the constraints which provide niteness of induced 2d gravity [5].

suppose that all masses have the order of magnitude of some specic scale m. now

if the curvature of the space-time and the strength of the gauge eld are small, i.e.,

|r|  m 2

,

|f f|  m 3

,

(2.7)

action (2.2) can be approximated by local decomposition in the curvature and the strength
tensor. in the leading approximation it coincides with classical action (2.1)

where the induced gravitational and cosmological constants are determined by the pa-
rameters of the quantum constituents (see appendix for details)

[g, a]  i[g, a]

,

(2.8)

=

it follows from (2.6) and (2.10) that the induced gravity requires that at least some scalar
constituents are non-minimally coupled with positive parameters s in order to provide
positivity of g. such models can be constructed for the certain choices of ms, md and s.
in what follows we will also assume that the induced cosmological constant is negative.

it should be noted, that although the constraints in 2d and 3d induced gravities
are the same and the theories are free from all the divergencies there is an important
dierence between them. the action of induced 2d gravity formulated in form (2.1) does
not provide dynamical equations for the metric. that is why one has to introduce massless
constituents to get the induced 2d gravity in the liouville form [5]. the attractive feature
of 3d gravity (2.1) is that its properties are similar to the einstein-maxwell gravity in
four dimensions and it has a number of interesting black hole solutions.

3 thermodynamics of charged black holes in adsm

gravity

a static charged black hole solution in 3d adsm-gravity (2.1) was found in [8]. it can
be written in the form

ds2 = n 2dt2 + n 2dr2 + r2d2
r
n 2 =
r+

(3.1)

(3.2)

where a2 = 1/. the point r = r+ corresponds to the black hole horizon, which in
three dimensions is a circle. the corresponding gauge potential is

a(r) = 

q

ln

r
r+

,

(3.3)

where q is the charge of the black hole. we impose condition at(r+) = 0 which provides
regularity of the vector eld on the horizon. one can also nd a generalization of this
solution, a rotating charged black hole, see [9], but we consider only static black holes,
for simplicity.

according to the bekenstein-hawking formula, the entropy of black hole (3.1)(3.3) is

sbh =

1
4ga =

r+
2g

,

(3.4)

where a is the length of the black hole horizon. the corresponding hawking temperature
is determined by the surface gravity  of the horizon

the black hole becomes extremal (th = 0) at

by using denitions (3.4) and (3.5) one nds a variational formula

where r and c are dimensional constants. note that in an arbitrary gauge, when the
condition at(r+) is not imposed,  is the dierence between electric potentials at the
black hole horizon and at some point r = r.

formula (3.7) has the form of the rst law of thermodynamics of a reissner-nordstrom
black hole, the parameter eh being identied with the energy. if an ads black hole has
no charge one can dene its energy by using abbott-deser [11] generalization of the adm
mass. this energy can be equivalently written as the integral [12]

madm = 

1

8g zcr

n(1k 1 k)

(3.10)

computed at the spatial circular boundary cr at r = r. here 1k = n(r)/r is the
extrinsic curvature of cr. denition (3.10) requires a subtraction of a reference back-
ground mass. this results in the term in (3.10) depending on the reference extrinsic
curvature 1 k . in the considered case the natural choice for the reference background
is the anti-de sitter space which is another solution of adsm-gravity

ds2 = 

n 2(r)
n 2(r)

n 2

0 (r)dt2 + n 2dr2 + r2d2

,

n 2(r) = 1 +

r2
a2

.

(3.11)

(3.12)

the normalization of the killing vector t coincides at r = r with normalization of t for
the black hole space-time. now, if one adopts (3.10) also as the denition of the energy
of a charged black hole and chooses c = 1/(8g) in (3.8),

eh = madm .

(3.13)

two remarks are in order regarding this equation. firstly, in three dimensions the electric
potential diverges logarithmically at innity. that is why the mass of the black hole
cannot be made nite even after subtracting the reference ads mass. secondly, for
asymptotically anti-de sitter spaces the temperature redshifts to zero at innity. thus,
the standard interpretation of eh as an internal thermodynamic energy of a black hole is
note quite correct. for the conventional formulation of black hole thermodynamic [13] one
should use the quasilocal energy [14]. however, the only dierence between this energy
and eh is in the redshift factor n(r).

it is worth also pointing out another possible denition of the black hole energy which
will be important for us later. according to wald and iyer [15], one can generally dene
the black hole energy in terms of the noether charge and a boundary function,

m = zcr

(q(t)nu + nb)

.

(3.14)

here q is the noether potential associated to the killing eld t, u and n are unit
normals to cr, inward-pointing and future-directed, respectively. function b comes out
from the boundary term in the action and is introduced to have a well-dened variational
procedure. by using formulas of [15] one nds for the einstein-maxwell theory (2.1)

q(t) =

1

8g

t;  fta

,

(3.15)

6

b = 

1

8g

k ,

(3.16)

where k is the extrinsic curvature of the spatial boundary of the black hole space-time
(at r = r). one can dene the corresponding energy m for reference ads space-time
(3.11). for these denitions the black hole energy takes the form

m  = m  m = madm  q ,

(3.17)

where the last term comes out from the contribution of the gauge eld in the noether
potential (3.15). one can also show that energy (3.17) coincides with hawking-horowitz
[12] denition of the mass as the surface term in the hamiltonian. according to the
general result of wald and iyer [15], the rst law of black hole thermodynamics looks as
follows

m = thsbh .

(3.18)

actually, there is no contradiction between this formula and the rst law (3.7). equation
(3.18) holds for boundary conditions which require xing the value of the potential  on
the boundary. by taking into account (3.17) and the fact that m is xed one can obtain
(3.7) from (3.18).

4 charged elds near a charged black hole

we begin with the discussion of some features related to interaction of a charged eld and
electric eld of a black hole near the horizon. for simplicity we will be dealing again with
static black holes only. however, our basic conclusions will hold for rotating black holes
as well. we also restrict the analysis by non-extremal black holes, and then comment on
extremal ones. the metric and the gauge potential can be taken in the form

ds2 = n 2(x)dt2 + gik(x)dxidxk

,

a = at(x)dt

.

(4.1)

(4.2)

the killing horizon is the surface where n 2(x) = 0 and it is assumed that on this surface
at = 0. we consider a space-time with an arbitrary dimension. let us investigate the
spectrum of single-particle excitations of a scalar eld described by the klein-gordon
equation

(dd + m2) = 0 , d =  + iea

,

(4.3)

where e is the charge of the eld. by substituting the wave-function with the energy 

one obtains the equation

(t, x) = eit(x)

h 2()(x) = 2(x)

equation (4.5) has the form of the relativistic schroedinger equation with a specic
hamiltonian h() where potential term (4.8) depends on the frequence . for an-
tiparticles one obtains the same potential term (4.8) where charge e should be replaced
by e (or  by ).

in general, solution of problem (4.5) may be quite complicated. however, the eect
of the gauge interaction near the horizon is easy to understand. in the vicinity of the
horizon of a nonextremal black hole

,

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

where  is the surface gravity constant and  is the proper distance to the horizon (located
at  = 0).

therefore, interaction near the horizon with the electric eld of the black hole shifts eec-
tively masses of elds.

the parameter e+ in (4.10) is the strength of the electric eld on the horizon,

e+ = lpf

,

(4.12)

where l and p are two mutually orthogonal normals to the bifurcation surface, l2 =
p2 = 1, p is future directed. for charged black hole (3.2), (3.3)

e+ =

q

4r+

.

(4.13)

now, we can take into account that quantum elds which are in a thermal equilibrium
with the black hole have to be at the hawking temperature th = /2. thus, the main
contribution into observable quantities comes from frequences   th while contribution
from   th is exponentially small. it means that in order to estimate the eect one
can assume that

h 2()  22hx + m2i

m2 = m2 + ee+ ,

,

(4.14)

(4.15)

where   o(1) is a numerical coecient. correspondingly, for antiparticles the charge e
in m2 is replaced by e.

8

the eective mass m depends on the strength of the electric eld. if the electric eld
is strong, |e+|  m2/|e|, it creates particleanti-particle pairs and this process results in
the instability of the quantum state.

in what follows we assume that the eld is weak and there is no pair creation process.
as we will see, this condition is satised in the induced gravity in the low energy
limit. in this case, the physical picture is basically the same as for neutral black holes
or uncharged elds [16] and the shift of the masses is an irrelevant eect. in particular
by using results for uncharged elds one concludes that the spectrum of energies  is
continuous and does not have the mass gap. the density of the energy levels dn/d, of
h() is divergent near the horizon, and this results in the divergence of the entropy of
quantum elds. the leading divergence, however, is the same as for uncharged elds.

now we briey comment on extremal black holes. in this case the behavior of charged
elds is dierent. near the horizon of an extremal black hole n 2  (r  r+)2 and at 
(r r+), see, e.g., eqs. (3.2), (3.3) and (3.6). thus, the ratio at/n 2 is singular at r = r+,
and the eect cannot be described by shift of the mass (4.11). instead, behavior of a
charged particle near the horizon is similar to moving in a at space with the potential
term |qat|. however, because this potential vanishes it cannot seriously change the
spectrum of single-particle hamiltonian (4.6) and bring new features into the considered
problem. anyway, the hawking temperature of extremal black holes is zero and it seems
there is no much sense in considering statistical-mechanical entropy of the constituents.
we will not be discussing extremal black holes anymore.

5 black hole entropy in adsm gravity

we are now ready to discuss statistical mechanical interpretation of the black hole entropy
sbh in induced einstein-maxwell gravity. we relate sbh to the entanglement entropy
ssm of the constituent elds. to regularize the divergences caused by the horizon we use
the pauli-villars regularization and introduce for the each constituent with the mass m
three additional elds, one with the normal statistics and the mass m1 = m2 + 22 and
two with the wrong statistics and the masses m2 = m2 + 2. the parameter  is the
pauli-villars cuto.

the analysis of the divergences in three dimensions is similar to other dimensions, see,
e.g., [17],[16]. it can be shown that in three dimensions only the leading divergences are
present. by following the method of [17] one immediately nds the regularized values of
the densities of the energy levels

  dn
d! =

b(, m)

(5.1)

for a charged scalar or spinor constituent. here a = 2r+ is the length of the black hole
horizon. expressions (5.1) include for each eld contributions of particles and antiparti-

(5.2)

where m() and m() are eective masses of particles and antiparticles determined in
(4.11).

in the low energy limit of induced gravity the eect of shifting the masses is negli-
gibly small. according to (a.15), the charges of the constituents ek should be restricted

from above, |ek| < mk. thus, as follows from (2.7),

|eke+|  m2

k

,

(5.3)

which guarantees that there is no pair creation by the electric eld of the black hole. by
using this one can also rewrite (5.2) at  < th as

b(, m)  2  2m + o(2)

.

(5.4)

at low energies the terms quadratic in  and higher result in small corrections and we
neglect them in computations.

according to the induced gravity relation (1.1), the non-minimally coupled constituents
give additional contribution to the bekenstein-hawking entropy in the form of the noether
charge [2]

q = 2xs

(5.8)

where the eld operators are taken on the horizon. the charge q is ultraviolet-divergent

(5.10)

if the induced gravity constraints (2.6) are satised, the divergence of the noether charge
q compensates the divergence of the entropy ssm and the following identity

ssm  q =

1
4ga = sbh ,

(5.11)

where g is induced gravitational constant (2.9), takes place. therefore, the induced
gravity relation (1.1) holds for charged black holes as well.

the subtraction in entropy formula (5.11) has the same interpretation as for neutral
black holes in four-dimensional induced gravity [3], [6]. to see this, it should be noted rst
that the bekenstein-hawking entropy of a charged black hole in induced adsm gravity is
related to the spectrum of the black hole mass m dened by eq. (3.14). indeed, consider
a small excitation of constituent elds with energy e over a vacuum (e = 0). such an
excitation results in a change of black hole parameters. the corresponding variational
formula was studied in [18] 1

where the energy

m = thsbh + e

,

e = zt

t td

,

(5.12)

(5.13)

is determined in terms of the stress-energy tensor of the constituents t  (t is the
hypersurface of constant time t, dt is the future-directed vector of the volume element
of t, and t are the components of t).

thus, for a black hole with the xed area the spectrum of m is related to the spec-
trum of energies e of the constituents. on the other hand, the statistical-mechanical
entropy ssm of the constituents is determined by the spectrum of their hamiltonian h
which generates canonical transformations of the system along the killing eld t. the
observation crucial for understanding entropy relation (5.11) is that the energy e and
the hamiltonian h of the non-minimally coupled constituents dier by a total derivative
which picks up a non-vanishing contribution on the inner boundary  of t, i.e., on the
horizon. the boundary term is the noether charge on 

h  e = thq ,

(5.14)

where th is the hawking temperature.
expect that the two entropies, sbh and ssm , are dierent and related by (5.11).

it is because of eqs. (5.12), (5.13), (5.14) we

1it is worth mentioning that eq. (5.12) was derived in ref. [18] for uncharged black holes. however,
if the mass of the black hole is dened by (3.14), formula (5.12) takes place for charged black holes as
well. equation (5.12) holds in the linear order in perturbations provided that the background black hole
metric and the gauge potential satisfy the equations of motion. also, the variations of matter elds have
to vanish on the boundary of the black-hole space-time. this requirement, however, is not important
because the constituent elds are trapped inside the potential barrier and can be excited only in a thin
layer near the horizon.

11

now a remark concerning charged rotating black holes is in order. this sort of black
hole solutions in adsm gravity was found in ref. [9] and represents a generalization of
static solution (3.1)(3.3). in the corresponding induced gravity the constituent elds co-
rotate together with a black hole2. in the corotating frame of reference one can dene a
canonical ensemble of the constituents and compute their entropy ssm . obviously, in the
corotating frame the properties of the constituents are as if the black hole were static and,
in the leading order, ssm is given by (5.7). (one can verify this by doing a more rigorous
analysis, see ref.
[6].) therefore, in induced adsm gravity the entropy of rotating
charged black holes is still expressed by formula (5.11). also, the above interpretation of
(5.11) can be extended to take into account the rotation, see again ref. [6].

6 concluding remarks

in conclusion we comment on black holes in four-dimensional induced einstein-maxwell
gravity3. there is a number of reasons to believe that basic features of the entropy of
charged black holes in four dimensions will be similar to properties of the entropy of
charged black holes in adsm gravity.

to see what is happening in four dimensions let us consider rst the density of energy

levels of an uncharged scalar eld computed, say, in pauli-villars regularization [16]

3constructing such a theory with charged constituents would require cancellation of additional ultravi-
olet divergences, and it would be more complicated than constructing adsm gravity in three dimensions
or induced pure einstein gravity in four dimensions.

these expressions are even functions of  and, as a consequence, they do not depend on
 at large . the similar changes in the density of levels take place for charged spinor
elds.

as follows from (6.18), (6.19), the interaction of charged particles with the electric
eld does not change the ultraviolet divergence of the density of levels near the horizon.
the electric eld strength e+ appears only in nite corrections to dn/d. analogously,
the divergences of the statistical entropy ssm of elds does not depend on the gauge in-
teraction and remain purely geometrical. this property is the same as in case of the
three-dimensional charged black holes.

what properties may one expect in induced einstein-maxwell gravity in four dimen-
sions? the bekenstien-hawking entropy sbh of a charged black hole is one quarter of
the horizon area a regardless the presence of gauge elds. also the entropy ssm of the
constituents and the corresponding noether charge remain proportional to a in the lead-
ing order and do not depend on e+. that is why one can conclude that the entropy sbh
for charged and neutral black holes has the universal form (1.1).

this sort of universality is very important and, as we stressed earlier [2], it demon-
strates that the mechanism of generation of the bekenstein-hawking entropy is a low-
energy phenomenon which depends neither on the properties of a black hole nor on the
specic structure of an underlying fundamental theory of gravity (on the number of species
of constituents and their parameters, for example).

our analysis holds for near extremal black holes whose thermodynamical behavior is
known to be similar to properties of a two-dimensional massless quantum gas. it is in-
triguing problem to understand on the level of the induced gravity constituents how this
eective two-dimensional description becomes possible. another aspect of near-extremal
black holes is that they can be described by an eective string theory (by a 2d super-
symmetric conformal eld theory) see, e.g., [19]. thus, at this point the induced gravity
and string theory derivations of the black hole entropy overlap and one has a chance to
explore whether there is any correspondence between the two pictures.

a appendix

here we comment on how eqs. (2.6), (2.9), (2.10) can be obtained. for simplicity we
consider euclidean theory and use the standard representation

w = 



2 z

for the regularized one-loop eective action

w =

(a.2)

with  = 1 and  = 1 for boson and fermion elds, respectively. here l is the wave
operator, ls = dd + r for scalar constituents, and ld = dd + 1
4 r for spinor
ones. the covariant derivative is d =  + ea. the parameter  is the ultraviolet
cuto.

when the mass m of the eld is suciently high it is enough to approximate w by the
local expansion over the mass parameter. to this aim one replaces the trace of the heat
kernel of l in (a.1) by the asymptotic expansion over s with the heat kernel coecients
an. in three dimensions the calculation gives

w =

equation (a.14) is equivalent to three conditions (2.6) which can be satised for a number
of models. the total induced action is determined then by the contributions of the regular

limit. note that in this limit the terms quadratic in curvature can be also neglected as
compared with the einstein-maxwell part. then after the wick rotation functional
(a.16) coincides with the lorentzian action (2.1).
