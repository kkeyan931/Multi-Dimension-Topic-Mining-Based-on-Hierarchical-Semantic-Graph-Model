it has been argued that the extremal dilaton black holes exhibit a ux expulsion of abelian-higgs
vortices. we re-examine carefully the problem and give analytic proofs for the ux expulsion always
takes place. we also conduct numerical analysis of the problem using three initial data sets on the
horizon of an extreme dilatonic black hole, namely, core, vacuum and sinusoidal initial conditions.
we also show that an abelian-higgs vortex can end on the extremal dilaton black hole. concluding,
we calculate the backreaction of the abelian-higgs vortex on the geometry of the extremal black
hole and drew a conclusion that a straight cosmic string and the extreme dilatonic black hole hardly
knew their presence.

i. introduction

wheelers metaphoric dictum black holes have no hair, motivated by the earlier investigations on uniqueness theo-

rems for black holes (see ref. [1] and references therein), has had a great inuence on the development of black hole

physics. in the recent years there has been a considerable resurgance of mathematical works on black hole equilibrium

sates. we are faced with the discoveries of black hole solutions in many theories in which einstein equations are cou-

pled with self-interacting matter elds. the discovery of bartnik and mckinnon [2] of a nontrivial point like structure

in einstein-yang-mills system reveals new realms of nontrivial solutions to einstein-non-abelian gauge systems.

recently, the other sort of problems has been taken into account. the no hair conjecture has been extended to the

problems when topologies of some eld congurations are not trivial. the story began with the work of aryal et al.

[3]. though they considered a pure gravity theory, they wrote down the metric of a black hole with a conical decit

and claimed that this was the metric describing the schwarzschild black hole with a cosmic string passing through it.

this work gave rise to the researches concerning the extension of the afore mentioned no hair conjecture. in ref. [4],

the extension of these considerations announced the existence of the euclidean einstein equations corresponding to a

vortex sitting on the horizon of the black hole. achucarro et al. [5] presented the numerical and analytic evidence for

an abelian-higgs vortex can act as a long hair for the schwarzschild black hole. chamblin et al. [6] generalized the

analysis of ref. [5] and allowed the black hole to be charged. using numerical analysis they found that all of the elds

connected with the vortex were expelled from the extremal black hole. the extremal black hole displayed an analog

1

of a meissner eect. however, the recent works of bonjuor et al. [7] show subtleties in the treatment of the event

horizon, showing that a ux expulsion can occur but it does not do so in all cases. analytic proofs for an expulsion

and a penetration of a ux in the case of the extremal charged black hole were also presented.

nowadays, it seems that the superstring theories are the most promissing candidates for a consistent quantum

theory of gravity. numerical studies of the solutions to the low-energy string theory, i.e., the einstein-dilaton black

holes in the presence of a gauss-bonnet type term, disclosed that they were endowed with a nontrivial dilaton hair

[8]. this dilaton hair is express ed in term of its adm mass [9]. the extended moduli and dilaton hair and their

associated axions for a kerr-newmann black hole background were computed in ref. [10]. on the other hand, a full

analysis of a cosmic string in dilaton gravity was given in ref. [11]. an abelian higgs vortex in the background of an

euclidean electrically charged dilaton black hole was studied in ref. [12]. it was shown that this kind of the euclidean

black hole can support a vortex solution on a horizon of the black hole. the vortex eect was to cut out a slice out

of the considered black hole geometry. in ref. [13] the authors argued that an electrically charged dilaton black hole

could support a long range eld of a nielsen-olesen string. using both numerical and perturbative techniques the

properties of an abelian-higgs vortex in the presence of the considered black hole were investigated. in the case of

an extreme dilatonic black hole the analog of the meissner eect was revealed.

in this paper we will try to provide some continuity with our previous works [12]- [13]. namely, we shall re-examine

the problem of the ux expulsion in the presence of the extremal dilaton black hole in the light of the arguments

recently quoted by bonjour et al. [7]. we have provided analytical proofs that vortices will wrap around the extreme

dilatonic black hole. then, we conduct the numerical analysis of the problem.

the paper is organized as follows. in sec.ii we briey review some results obtained in ref. [13] that will be needed,

so that the paper becomes self-contained. we also conduct analytic considerations of the expulsion problem of the

nielsen-olesen vortex in the presence of an extreme dilatonic black hole. in sec.iii, we give a numerical analysis of the

problems taking into account three initial data sets on the horizon of the black hole, i.e., core, vacuum and sinusoidal

initial conditions. we also pay attention to the problem of a vortex which terminates on the extremal dilaton black

hole. before concluding our considerations, in sec.iv, we discuss the gravitational backreaction.

ii. nielsen-olesen vortex and a dilaton black hole

in this section we shall review some material published in ref. [13] in order to establish notation and convention

and for the paper to be self-contained. we also gave some analytic arguments in favour of a ux expulsion. in our

consideration we shall study an abelian-higgs vortex in the presence of a dilaton black hole assuming a complete

separation of degrees of freedom of each of the objects. our system will be described by the action which is the sum

of the action for a low-energy string theory [14], which in the einstein frame, has the form

s1 =z gd4x(cid:20) r

16g  2()2  e2f 2(cid:21) ,

(1)

and s2 is the action for an abelian higgs system minimally coupled to gravity and be subject to spontaneous symmetry

breaking. it yields

the eld  is not a dynamical quantity. in a at spacetime the nielsen-olesen vortices have the cylindrically symmetric

solutions of the forms

 = x()ein ,

p = n p (),

(7)

(8)

where  is the cylinder radial coordinate, n is the winding number.

as far as a static, spherically symmetric solution of the equations of motion derived from the action s1 is concerned

it is determined by the metric of a charged dilaton black hole. the metric may be written as [15]

ds2 = (cid:18)1 

dr2

2m

r (cid:19) dt2 +
m which are related to the mass m and charge q by the relation q2 = r+r

m(cid:19) (deta2 + sin2 d2),

(cid:0)1  2m
r (cid:1)

+ r(cid:18)r 

q2

(9)

where we dene r+ = 2m and r = q2

2 e20.
the charge of the dilaton black hole q, couples to the eld f, is unrelated to the abelian gauge eld b associated

with the vortex. the dilaton eld is given by e2 = (cid:0)1  r

r (cid:1) e20, where 0 is the dilatons value at r  . the

event horizon is located at r = r+. for r = r is another singularity, one can however ignore it because r < r+.
the extremal black hole occurs when r = r+, when q2 = 2m 2e20.

in what follows, we shall consistently assume that x and p are functions of r,  coordinates. then, equations of

motion for these elds are given by

one can show ref. [16], that in normal spherically symmetric coordinates x is a function of g33 and one will try
with the coordinates r =qr(r  q2
m ) sin , namely x = x(r) and p = p(r). taking into account the thin string
limit, i.e., m  1, equations for x(r) and p (r) can be reduced to the nielsen-olesen type up to the errors of an
adequate order (see ref. [13]).

the main task of our work will be to answer the question about the ux expulsion in the case of the extremal dilaton

black hole. some numerical arguments concerning the so-called meissner eect were quoted in ref. [6]. now, having

in mind the arguments of ref. [7], we examine this problem carefully. we begin with the analytical considerations.

from now on, we shall consider only the extremal dilaton black hole, for which r+ = r.

as one can see from eqs.(10-11), the ux expulsion solution x = 0, p = 1 always solves these equations of

motion. thus, our strategy will be to show the nonexistence of a penetration solution. first of all, we assume that a

piercing solution does exist. this requirement is fullled when one has the nontrivial solutions x() and p () which

is symmetric around  = 
2 . for this value of the angel x has a maximum and p a minimum. expanding equations
of motion for p () near the poles indicates that p, = 0 at the poles. thus, there exists such a point 0  (0, 
2 ) for
which the second derivative of p () is equal to zero, namely p,(0) = 0 and p,(0) < 0. in the extremal black hole

case eq.(11) has the form as follows

p,  p, cot  = 0.

(12)

having in mind that p,(0) = 0 and cot 0 6= 0 in the considered interval of , we reach to the contradiction with our
starting assumption that p,(0) < 0. this is sucient to conclude that the ux expulsion must always take place.

further, after proving that the ux expulsion must take place for a suciently thick string, we proceed to the case

of a thin string. as was remarked in ref. [7] in order to consider the case of a thin string one has to look at the

eqs.(10-11) in the exterior region of the horizon. to begin with, we assume that there is a ux expulsion. therefore
m )  1. hence

near the horizon of the extremal dilaton black hole, one has r[(r  2m )2rx] > 0, x 32m (2m  q2

from eq. (10) we obtain

sin2 r[(r  2m )2rx] + sin [sin x]  xn 2p 2 = 0.

(13)

the function x is symmetric around 

2 , having maximum xm. integrating eq.(13) on the interval (, 

2 ), for  > 

we arrive at the inequality

x() > x()(cid:20) n 2

sin 

ln tan



2(cid:21) .

then using the fact that x, < 0 on [0, 

2 ], one can deduce that x, < x()x(0)

(14)

< x()

 . this shows that the

inequality

the analytic solution of equations of motion for the dilaton black hole which size was small comparing to the vortex

size were considered by the present authors in ref. [13]. it was done for the large n -limit. then it happened that,
inside a core of the vortex the gauge symmetry will be unbroken, and the expectation that x 2
  0 is well justied.

these all provided the solution of eq.(11) as

where p is an integration constant equal to twice the magnetic eld strength at the center of the core [5]. on the

p  1  pr sin2 ,

(16)

other hand, the solution for x yields

x  bn (r) sinn .

(17)

where b(r) is given by eq.(21) in ref. [13]. the exact form of x ensures its vanishing on the extremal black hole

horizon. concluding we see that, using analytical arguments one has always the expelling of the elds from the

extreme dilaton black hole horizon. as we see in the next section these analytical considerations are fully conrmed

by numerical investigations.

iii. numerical results

to conrm our results from previous section we performed number of numerical calculations for extremal dilaton

black holes with strings. the numerical method is simply the same as in our previous article [13] (see also ref. [17]).
namely, the elds x and p are replaced with their discreted values on the polar grid (r, )  (ri = 2m + ir, k =
k) according to the dierence version of the equations of motion (10) and (11)

the boundary conditions are imposed on large radii and for a string core according to

(x, p ) =(cid:26) (1, 0),

(0, 1),

r  
r  2m,  = 0, .

boundary conditions on the horizon are guessed at the begining of calculation and then updated in accordance with

eqs. (20) and (21). the process of relaxation and updating of the elds on the horizon of the black hole is repeated

until convergence take place.

as an initial guess we used three sets of dierent boundary conditions as proposed by bonjour et al. [7], i.e.,

5

1. core: x = 0, p = 1,

2. vacuum: x = 1, p = 0,

3. sinusoidal: x() = sin , p = 1.

in all above cases we received the same nal conguration of the elds always showing the string expulsion from

the extreme dilatonic black hole. these conm our previous theoretical predictions. the results of the numerical

calculations are presented in fig. 1.

further, we pay our attention to the case of a cosmic string ending on the extreme dilatonic black hole. this is an

important conguration as the main phenomenological input to the instantons mediating defect decays (se, e.g., [18]-

[20]). namely, in ref. [16] it was shown that the nielsen-olesen solution could be used to construct regular metrics

which represented vortices ended on black holes either in a static equilibrium or accelerating o to innity. the latter

metric depicts a cosmic string which is eaten by accelerating black holes.

to consider numerically a string ending on the black hole we have to slightly modify the boundary conditions (22).

they remain the same at the outer boundary and in the string core for  = 0. for  =  we initially set x = 1

and p = 0. during the calculation values of the elds were updated on each step according to p, = 0 and x, = 0.

these were chosen to assure the numerical stability. on the horizon we set vaccum boundary conditions to avoid

the possibility that ux expulsion, if it occures, may be caused by the inapropriate choice of initial conditions on the

horizon. the results of our simulations for extreme dilatonic black hole with m = 1.0 and  = n = 1 are presented

in fig. 2.

iv. gravitational backreaction

the gravitational backreaction of the string on the dilaton black hole geometry was studied in ref. [13]. as one

can compare the resultant metric we shall obtain and the conical metric gained in ref. [13] they are the same. but in

our previuos attitude we did not pay attention to the corrections of other elds in the theory. therefore our previous

results were not correct. in this section we consider the backreaction problem taking into account all the elds in the

theory.

in order to consider the gravitational backreaction eect of the string superimposed on the dilaton black hole one

needs to consider a general static axially symmetric solution to the einstein-maxwell-dilaton abelian-higgs equations

of motion. first, we nd a coordinate transformation which enalbes us to write the spherical dilaton black hole metric

in the axisymmetric form. using the coordinate transformation as follows:

2 = (r  2m )(cid:18)r 
z =(cid:18)r  m 

q2

2m(cid:19) cos ,

q2

m (cid:19) sin2 ,

the metric of the charged dilaton black hole may be rewritten in the axisymmetric form, namely

ds2 = e20dt2 + 2

0e20d2 + e20+20(d2 + dz2),

(23)

the dilaton black hole metric (25) will constitute, to the zeroth order, our background solution. the relevant equations

of motion become

(cid:0)e22f0(cid:1) + z(cid:0)e22f0z(cid:1) = 0,

which is the purely function of r. as in the schwarzschild case [5], this strongly suggests to look for the metric

perturbat ions as a function of r.

which yields that f = f0 is equal to a constant value. the magnetic correction one can get either directly or using the
duality transformation [22], which implies f  f ,   , where f = 1

now, we turn to a decit angle, which has the form  = 2(a + c) = 8g, where  is the total mass of string per

unit length. on the other hand, its adm mass generalized to an asymptotically at space is written [21]

the denition of the physical charge of the black hole, respectively for magnetic or electric charge is given by

taking into account the above corrections, one can consistently transform the metric to the (t, r, , ) coordinates

in which the asymptotic form of the metric is expressed as

one should notice [5] that the b-term is outside the range of the applicability of the considered approximation. after
rescalling coordinates t = ec/2t, r = ec/2r and dening the quantities m = ec/2m and q = ec/2q, one gets the

where ds = l[n]da and da is the element of surface area. the null vector n is orthogonal to the two-sphere on

finally, we will discuss another interesting problem that can be explored, i.e., the interaction of a cosmic string

with an extreme dilatonic black hole. we shall consider the vortex which is in a perfect aligment with an extremal

black hole axis. this assumptions enables one to get rid of great complications when the black hole and the vortex

are displaced to each other. we also assume that, we do not take into account details of the core structure of a cosmic

string. it is turned out that the extreme dilatonic black hole metric can be written as [23]

ds2 =

where we set the black hole at  = 0,  = 0, and z = 0. while u0 is dened by the relation cosh u0 = 2+z2+2

. the

obtained function is nonsingular away from the conical line and the singularity of the black hole. then, there are

no forces between the extremal black hole and the cosmic string. analogous results have been obtained in the case

of a cosmic string and an extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole [7]. of course, we should be aware of neglecting

the eect of the dilaton extremal black hole on the string core. nevertheless, using our assumption of a complete

separation of degrees of freedom of each of the objects one concludes that an extremal dilaton black hole and a straight

cosmic string will hardly feel their presence.

10

v. conclusions

in our work we ask the question of whether or not an abelian-higgs vortex is expelled from the extremal dilaton

black hole. we gave analytical arguments that no matter how thick was the vortex it was always expelled from the

considered black hole. in order to conrm our analytic results we performed numerical calculations in which boundary

conditions on the horizon of the extreme dilatonic black hole were guessed at the beginning of the process and updated

according to the adequate equations. we also paid attention to the vortices ending on the extremal dilaton black

hole.

finally, we studied the backreaction eect of the vortex on the geometry and the other elds in the theory under

consideration. in the thin string limit we get the conical dilaton black hole metric. concluding, we mentioned the

problem of an interaction between a straight cosmic string and an extremal dilaton black hole which was situated in

the perfect aligment with a black hole axis. according to the assumptions of the clear separation of the degrees of

freedom of these objects, one can conclude that they hardly feel their presence.
