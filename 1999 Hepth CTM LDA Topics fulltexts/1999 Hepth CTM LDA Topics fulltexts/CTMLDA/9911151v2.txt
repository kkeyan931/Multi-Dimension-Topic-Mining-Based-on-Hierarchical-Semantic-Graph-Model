abstract

in the frame of the scalar theory g4, we explore the occurrence of
thermal renormalons, i. e. temperature dependent singularities in the
borel plane. the discussion of a particular renormalon type diagram
at nite temperature, using thermoeld dynamics, allows us to es-
tablish that these singularities actually get a temperature dependence.
this dependence appears in the residues of the poles, remaining their
positions unchanged with temperature.

1 introduction

during the last years, there have been an impressive amount of theoret-
ical work on renormalons in dierent scenarios. for a recent review see [1].
one of the main motivations behind this eort concerns the non perturba-
tive structure of quantum chromodynamics (qcd). on the other side, nite
temperature eects have also called the attention of many authors [2], due to
their crucial role in understanding thermal aspects of the hadron dynamics,
whith special emphasis on the deconning phase transition and the produc-
tion of the quark gluon plasma [3]. it seems natural, therefore, to start a
systematic study of the occurrence and also the possible phenomenological
role of thermal renormalons. here we discuss, as a rst step in this direction,
the scalar theory g4.
in spite of being a non realistic approach for phe-
nomenological purposes, this analysis will allow us to gain a rst impression
on this kind of eects.

the fundamental characteristic of a renormalon type diagram is an in-
sertion of at least a chain of bubbles in a loop diagram, and behaves like
k! for large values of k, being k the number of bubbles in the chain. these
diagrams, in the usual zero temperature situation, induce the existence of
certain types of poles in the borel plane. in this paper we explore in detail
the extension to the nite temperature scenario of one kind of renormalon
type feynman diagrams, see fig. 1, that contribute to the two-point func-
tion. the set of diagrams we have chosen is an example of a renormalon type
contribution (ultraviolet renormalons, uvr), and gives us a hint about the
properties of the thermal borel plane, i.e. positions and residues of poles as
a function of temperature.

the discussion at nite temperature has been done using the machinery
of thermo field dynamics (tfd) [4]. the main result from our analysis
is that residues can get an explicit dependence on temperature, remaining,
nevertheless, the position of the poles in the borel plane unchanged.

the plan of this paper is as follows. in section 2, the analysis at zero tem-
perature of a particular set of feynman diagrams, see fig. 1, that contribute
to the two-point function in the g4 theory, allows us to show the presence
of a renormalon type singularity in the borel plane. section 3 is devoted
to a brief discussion of how to handle the chain of bubbles shown in fig. 2
at nite temperature. this will be done in the deep euclidean region, i.e.

2

p2  m2, of the momentum p that circulates through the chain of bubbles.
using these results, in section 4 we calculate our renormalon type diagram
(fig. 1) at nite temperature and proceed to present our conclusions.

2 the zero temperature renormalon

in the present paper the diagram shown in fig. 1 will be taken as a
source for renormalons. our goal is to explore the inuence of temperature
on this type of diagrams. let us call by rk(p) the diagram of order k, where
k denotes the number of vertices. in order to establish our notation, we will
rst review the zero temperature calculation for the renormalon asociated to
this diagram [6].

if we denote by b(l) the one loop correction to the four point function,

the so called sh diagram [8], we have

(p + l)2  m2 + i

(ig)k2 [b(l)]k1,

(1)

where the (ig)k2 factor is due to the double counting of vertices in b(l).
the relevant contribution to the integral comes from the deep euclidean
region. therefore, it is enough to approximate b(l) in this region.

b(l) =

(the argument of the logarithm is in mass units)

in this way we have

(p + l)2 + m2 (log(l2))k1,

(3)

where a wick rotation has been performed.

this expression is ultraviolet divergent. since g4 is a renormalizable
theory, we can concentrate on the nite part. in order to do this the propa-
gator is expanded in powers of 1/l2. the rst two ultraviolet divergent terms
are subtracted, and we keep only the rst convergent term in the expansion.
this procedure, which at the end induces one pole in the borel plane, i.e.
one renormalon, will be followed also in the next sections, where the nite
temperature corrections will be computed. due to this expansion, the de-
pendence on p, the external momentum of the two point function, actually
dissapears. so we nd

rk  i(cid:18) g

322(cid:19)kz dl

1
l3 (log(l2))k1.

(4)

in the last expression we can see that the main contribution to rk, at
large values of k, comes from large values of l, that corresponds to the deep
euclidean region, since we have done a wick rotation. introducing the new
variable l = et, we can see that rk becomes proportional to the gamma
function.

rk  i(cid:18) g

322(cid:19)k

(k).

(5)

let us remain breiy the idea of the borel transform. if, in general, we
have a divergent series in terms of a certain expansion parameter a, of the
form:

d[a] =

dnan,



xn=1

(6)

then, one possibility to give a meaning to this series is to make use of the borel
transform method [7], according to which a new perturbative expansion, in a
new expansion parameter b, is considered by dividing each coecient of the
previous series by n! in the following way

4

b[b] =



xn=0

dn+1

bn
n!

.

(7)

formally, we see that the d[a] corresponds to the laplace transform of
b[b]. using this idea in our case, we can introduce b[b] as the borel transform
of rk according to

gk ! bk1
b[b] = x  rk
(k  1)!
i



1  b/322 .

,

(8)

the k! behavior of rk, for large values of k, is responsible for the ap-
pearence of a pole in the real axis of the borel plane, i.e. in the integration
range of the laplace transform. the meaning of this or other poles in the
borel plane corresponds to an ambiguity in the resummation of the series.
physically, this imply the existence of essential errors associated to pertur-
batives expansions of physical magnitudes.

3 chain of bubbles at nite temperature

in this section we revise the nite temperature calculation for the chain
of bubbles shown in fig. 2, which contribute to the four-point function. the
original discussion can be found in [5]. later we will approximate our result
for deep euclidean values of the momentum that goes through the chain. let
us denote by ik the sum of all diagrams of the form shown in fig. 2, with
k bubbles and xed external vertices of type one, according to the rules of
tfd, including a global imaginary factor i. the sum is over all possible
combinations of internal type of vertices, which, as we know, can be of rst
or second type.

as it was shown in [5], and after correcting some missprints, ik can be

expressed as a function of i1 according to

(k + k).

from the zero temperature calculation, we know that the renormalon type
contribution of the diagram shown in fig. 1 comes from the deep euclidean

the chain, and p the momentum that circulates through the chain. in what
follows, we will examine the chain of bubbles in the deep euclidean region at

region, specically for p2  ek/2, where k is the number of bubbles in
nite temperature, assuming p2  ek/2. later, by replacing the explicit
previous condition, p2  ek/2, is actually realized.

expression for our chain of bubbles shown in fig. 1, we will check if the

first we calculate im i1 and re i1 for t 6= 0. from the four s that
appear in im i1 , eq. 18, it is easy to see that only those whose arguments
include energy dierences survive in the deep euclidean limit. so we have

turning to the real part of i1 , eq. 17, note that the argument of the
logarithm in the deep euclidean limit can be approximated in such a way
that the integral can be written as

where p2 is suciently large so that we can reach the main contribution to
the integral in the region where the logarithm can be expanded in powers of
4l|~p|/(p2). in the previous expression, q denotes a certain bound for the
integration in l such that for values of l bigger than q, the contribuition to
the integral turns out to be negligible due to the exponential supression. at
the end we can take q  . the real part, then, can be written as a series
in powers of 1/p2

(28)

where, once again, we have taken the assumption p2  ek/2. using this
fact, we can approximate in eqs. 19 and 20 cos(k)  1 and sin(k)  0. this
means that ik  gak. since b in eq. 21 can be neglected then ik  g(a/g)k.

therefore, using our expressions for the real part of i1, eqs. 15 and 26, nally
we get

(29)

this is the fundamental expression that we will use in the next section for
the discussion of our diagram at nite temperature. note that the leading
or rst term, which does not depend on temperature, is the same one we
found in the zero temperature analysis. the second term is the rst thermal
contribution. the dots denote higher order terms in the expansion in powers
of 1/p2.

it is interesting to mention that we can nd an approximated expression

4 renormalons at nite temperature

using eq. 29 for the chain of bubbles, the renormalon diagram shown in
fig. 1 will be calculated in the frame of tfd. at nite temperature, rk(t )
denotes the sum of all diagrams of the shape shown in fig. 1 with k vertices,
being the external vertices of the rst type. as it was the case in the chain of
bubbles, the sum is over all possible combinations of internal type of vertices.
in order to use our expression for ik, this sum must be performed before the
integral over the internal momentum that circulates through the chain of
bubbles. here we will obtain an expression for rk(t ), nding the location
of the induced poles in the borel plane and the corresponding residues.

the expression we have to deal with is

(32)

the zero temperature contribution arises from the zero temperature part
of the propagator times the zero temperature part of ik1. we would like
to discuss the following two cases: a) the product of the thermal part of the
propagator times the zero temperature part of ik1, denoted by ra
k, and b)
the product of the usual zero temperature propagator times ik1 (including
the zero temperature part of ik1), denoted by rb
k.

let us start with case a). we have

k(p) = z

(33)

the delta function excludes the deep euclidean region in the momentum
l. in spite of this fact, we can exime the limit |~l|  m, after the integration
in l0 has been done. it turns out that ra

k(p) is proportional to

ra

k(p)  i  g

322!k

(log l)k1.

(34)

the sum over k in the expression above is borel summable and, therefore,

it does not imply any renormalon.

the second case, case b), corresponds to

after the wick rotation and substracting the divergents terms, exactly in
the way as we did in section 2, we nd that the last expression is proportional
to

rb

322!k

z dt e2t"(2t)k1 + (k  1)(2t)k2e2tf2() +   #,

(36)

10

where the maxima of the rst and second terms in the integral are reached at

t = log(l2)  k/2 and t  k/4, respectively. note that the assumption we
made in the previous section, p2  ek/2, has changed now in the second

term, due to the factor 2 in the exponential. this fact does not aect our
approximations.

doing the integral, we see that rb

k is proportional to

rb

k  i  g

322!k

(k)  2 i f2()  g

642!k

(k) +   .

(37)

we see that those terms proportional to the product of the tempera-
ture dependent part of the propagator times the whole series of ik are borel
summable, since the leading term in the series of ik, case a), is already borel
summable. on the contrary, the zero temperature part of the propagator
times ik gives us a series of terms that behave like k! being, therefore, non
borel summable. we have calculated explicitly the rst temperature depen-
dent term of this series associated to a k! behavior.

the borel transform, b[b], of the sum p rk, taking into account only

those non-summable borel terms, is given by:

b[b] = x rk

(38)

the rst term in the last expression is the zero temperature renormalon
we found in section 2. the second term corresponds to the rst thermal
singularity in the borel plane, and the dots denote a whole series of poles.
the structure of singularities in the borel plane, associated to our renormalon
type diagram, is shown in fig. 3. the leading or rst pole along the real
axis is the zero temperature renormalon. the series of new thermal poles,
i.e. thermal renormalons, to the right side of the rst one, are subleading
contributions to the borel sum ambiguity.

summarizing, in this paper we have discussed thermal corrections to a
particular renormalon type diagram in the theory g4. from this analysis, we
show the existence of thermal singularities in the borel plane associated to
this particular diagram. the main properties of these thermal renormalons

11

b

figure 3: singularities in the borel plane.

are the following: a) their location in the borel plane does not depend on
temperature. they are situated at the points where the zero temperature
renormalons are usually located, i.e. at n/0, being n an integer and 0 the
rst coecient of the  function [11]. b) their residues, on the contrary,
have an explicit dependence on temperature, through the factors fn() that
vanish when t  0.
the conclusions from the particular diagram we have discussed here, sug-
gest us to conjecture that these will be actually general properties of the borel
plane associated to correlation functions at nite temperature: residues, in
general, will depend on temperature being, however, the location of the poles
temperature independent. thermal renormalons in the scalar theory are al-
ways subleading in the ambiguity of borel sum, i.e. the leading pole is tem-
perature independent. this fact is related to the ultraviolet character of the
renormalons in this theory. thermal corrections are associated to long dis-
tance correlations in the system, whereas the leading renormalons come from
the singular behavior at short distances. something equivalent happens with
the axial anomaly, where it has been shown that the anomaly itself does not
depend on temperature [12]. in qcd this situation will be probably dierent
due to the existence of infrared renormalons.
