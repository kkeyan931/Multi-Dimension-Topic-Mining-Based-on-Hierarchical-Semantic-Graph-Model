(5.6) therefore, di7 = p (f7, r) (cf. eq.

(at least) two issues must addressed. first, question normalization: gauge, gravitational mixed chernsimons terms quantized coecients, may turn consistent inconsistent local anomaly cancellation various models. second open problem physical origin 7d chernsimons terms. anomalies cancel locally models considered sections 24 without help cs terms, cs terms appear models? moment cs terms still seem pose many new questions able answer. hope able report progress issue near future. 6. summary discussion paper investigated correspondence perturbative heterotic e8 e8 orbifolds 4/zn , (n = 2, 3, 4, 6) m-theory duals. aim obtain information structure m-theory orbifolds, particular spatial locations charged elds gauge groups act upon them. main tools constraints arising local consistency quantum numbers, gauge 36 coupling considerations requirements local anomaly cancellation. put forward scenario allowed us resolve apparent paradox associated existence twisted massless states simultaneously charged gauge groups appear live two dierent boundary ten-planes. resolution relies mixing factor (or factors) gauge group g living one boundary ten-plane g7 gauge groups living xed seven-planes r5,1 {f.p.} s1/z2 orbifold. twisted states live i6 planes xed seven-planes reach ten-plane boundary thus perfectly local g7 g charges. thanks mixing, however, g7 charges states masquerade perturbative g charges six-dimensional point view, hence appearance simultaneous g g charges heterotic perturbation theory. considerations gauge couplings conrm mixing non- perturbative gauge groups seven-planes perturbative gauge group boundary planes. another conrmation comes overall 6d anomaly polynomial. powerful test however local anomaly cancellation. correct al- location states particular hyper vector component seven-plane gauge multiplets six-planes anomaly required cancel absolutely crucial. consistent assignment states possible judicious choice boundary conditions seven-plane elds projects vector components one side hyper-component other. also guaranteed additional massless states r11 0 heterotic limit. three contributions net local anomaly: quantum anomalies, inow anomalies intersection anomalies. given correct identication locally rele- vant elds, quantum one-loop anomalies fairly straightforward, inow intersection anomalies involve un-settled issues overall normalization. principle, overall normalization inow anomalies follows chernsimons terms eleven-dimensional sugra, derivation rather subtle result controversial. instead, simply calibrated normalization requiring local anomaly cancellation z2 model (cf. section 3), used normalization models section 4; eventually, normalization ought conrmed direct derivation. likewise, parameters intersection anomaly (cf. eqs.

(4.17), = (1) indeed universally valid, parameter tricky: = 1 works model g7 = sun (cf. sections 3 4) models invisible abelian g7 = u (n1) (cf. section 5.1) require = 0 instead. unfortunately, dont know yet m-theoretic origin seven-plane sun breakdown cartan subgroup models, dont know cartan 1 subgroups ends = 0 either. worse anomaly trouble plagues models abelian factors perturbative gauge groups, cf. section 5.2. models, local anomalies simply cancel consistent choices seven-plane gauge elds boundary conditions two ends x11. presumably means one two things: either dont know correctly interpret models m-theory terms else must additional sources local anomalies. example, chernsimons term seven-plane eective action eect transferring local 6d anomaly one boundary seven plane boundary, thus possibly helping cancel local anomalies boundaries. much work needed however know whether mechanism really works. main conclusion heterotic orbifolds consistent m-theory du- als identical massless spectra gauge couplings locally cancelled anomalies. unfortunately, duality local anomalies tell us happen every six-, seven- ten-plane dual model, understand happens m-theory. big mystery dynamic origin boundary conditions seven-plane elds. particular, know seven-plane eld always exactly opposite boundary conditions two boundaries 7p , m-theoretic reasons twist remain completely obscure. another mystery zn-xed seven-planes carry full sun gauge groups models models sun broken subgroup; fact, even sure mechanism seven-plane symmetry breaking. however quite certain eventual resolution issues shed much new light basic structure m-theory. conclude article comments m-theory duals four-dimensional heterotic orbifolds. generally, models live ir3,1 (t 6/) (s1/z2) comprising 11d bulk, xed seven-planes, xed ve-planes well respective ten-plane, six-plane four-plane boundaries. bulk, seven-planes boundaries behave 6d orbifolds (modulo orbifolding extra compact coordinates), ve-planes radically complicate physics. problem xed ve- planes poorly understood m-theory point view. know singular ve-planes m-theory carry superconformal theories whose excitations 38 include massless particles tensionless strings. generally, superconformal theories dimensions associated innite-coupling gauge theories, m- theory tells us nothing gauge group, global symmetries (if any) gauge-invariant operators data quite insucient model building purposes. also, constraints local anomaly cancellation four-plane boundaries ve-planes rather weak, simply anomalies four dimensions much simpler six. consequently, although tentatively identied m- theory duals 4d heterotic orbifolds, enough constraints condent identication time writing. work progress hope present interesting results near future. acknowledgements: important part project accomplished v. k., j. s. s. y. visited universitat munchen. would like thank sektion physik hospitality. s.y would also like thank theory group cern. s.t. would like thank r. minasian c. scrucca helpful discussions. 39 appendix a. anomaly polynomials n = 1 multiplets d=6 appendix summarizes six-dimensional gravitational, gauge mixed anom- aly contributions relevant six-dimensional n = 1 multiplets, see e.g. {$9503124$}. representation content multiplet spelled terms little group so4 su2 su2 massless particles 6d. correctly normalized anomaly polyno- mials i8 = 4!(2)3 a, (a.1) since use instead i8 throughout paper, anomalies written terms well. gravity multiplet : 273 240 agrav = (trr2)2 . trr4 + 51 192 (a.2) tr trace vector representation so(6). vector-multiplets nv : nv 192 av = trr4 nv 240 (trr2)2 + 1 4 trr2trvf 2 trvf 4 ; (a.3) since vector multiplets comprise adjoint representation gauge group g, trv trace adjoint representation nv = dim(g). hyper-multiplets nh: nh 192 ah = trr4 + nh 240 (trr2)2 1 4 trr2trhf 2 + trhf 4 , (a.4) trh trace representation g comprised hypermultiplets (whatever representation might particular model) nh net number hypermultiplets model. self-dual-tensor multiplet : 7 atensor = 29 240 trr4 192 (trr2)2 .
