abstract

we compute by bethe ansatz both bulk and boundary hole scattering matrices for
the critical a(1)
n 1 quantum spin chain. the bulk s matrix coincides with the soliton
s matrix for the a(1)
n 1 toda eld theory with imaginary coupling. we verify our
result for the boundary s matrix using a generalization of the ghoshal-zamolodchikov
boundary crossing relation.

1 introduction

magnetic chains associated with ane lie algebras [1], [2] constitute large classes of inte-
grable models. these models hold both mathematical and physical interest.
indeed, the
models can be shown to have certain quantum-algebra symmetries which are characterized
by a parameter q. a variety of powerful analytical techniques can be brought to bear on
these models, yielding in the thermodynamic limit exact properties such as excitation spec-
tra, scattering matrices, and correlation functions. these models, which can be regarded
as discretized integrable quantum eld theories, have numerous applications to statistical
mechanics and condensed matter physics.

in a previous paper [3] we began investigating the simplest such class of models, namely,
the a(1)
n 1 spin chain. this class includes the well-known xxz chain as the special case
n = 2. there we considered the noncritical regime (real q), for which there is a mass gap,
and for which the s matrices are characteristic of q-deformed quantum eld theory.

in the present work we continue our investigation of the a(1)

n 1 spin chain, but consider
instead the critical regime (|q| = 1). we compute by bethe ansatz both bulk and boundary
hole scattering matrices. our result for the bulk s matrix coincides with the soliton s
matrix for the a(1)
n 1 toda eld theory with imaginary coupling [4]-[6]. we also generalize
the ghoshal-zamolodchikov [7] boundary crossing relation to the a(1)
n 1 case (for which the
bulk s matrix does not have crossing symmetry), and use it to help verify our result for the
boundary s matrix. for n = 2, the boundary s matrix reduces to the well-known result
for the critical xxz open spin chain [7]-[9]; while in the isotropic limit, it coincides with the
result found in [10].

2 the model and its symmetries

we begin by briey reviewing the construction of the model, both closed (periodic boundary
conditions) and open with diagonal boundary elds. 1 for an introduction to the yang-
baxter equation, integrable spin chains, and the bethe ansatz, see e.g. [11], [12].

2.1 closed chain

the main ingredient for constructing an integrable closed spin chain is a solution r of the
yang-baxter equation

r12() r13( + ) r23() = r23() r13( + ) r12() .

we consider here the a(1)

n 1 r matrix [12]

ejk  ekj e sign(jk) ,

(1)

(2)

1our notations closely follow those of ref.

[3], in which the noncritical regime is studied, with the

r() = axj

ejj  ejj + bxj6=k

ejj  ekk + cxj6=k

anisotropy parameter  replaced by i.

1

where the indices j , k take values from 1 to n , and ejk are elementary n  n matrices with
matrix elements (ejk)ab = jakb. moreover,

a = sinh (( + i)) ,

b = sinh() ,

c = sinh(i) ,

(3)

where the anisotropy parameter  is real. the r matrix becomes su(n ) invariant for   0,
and is proportional to the permutation matrix for  = 0.

the corresponding closed-chain transfer matrix t() is given by

t() = tr0 t0() ,

(4)

where tr0 denotes trace over the auxiliary space 0, and t0() is the monodromy matrix

t0() = r0n ()    r01() .

(5)

we restrict the number of spins, n, to be an even number.

the closed-chain hamiltonian h is given by the logarithmic derivative of the transfer

matrix at  = 0,

where the two-site hamiltonian h is given by

h 

d

h = xj6=k

ejj  ekk eisign(jk) + xj6=k

n 1

hn ,n+1 + hn ,1) ,

ejk  ekj .

(6)

(7)

here we restrict  to lie in the range   (0 , ). 2 as for the a(1)
n 1 toda eld theory with
imaginary coupling, the hamiltonian for n > 2 is not hermitian. nevertheless, we nd in
our study of low-lying states (see sec. 3) only real energy eigenvalues.

the transfer matrix has an exact u(1)n 1 symmetry. indeed, let

s(k) = ekk  ek+1 ,k+1 ,

k = 1 , . . . , n  1 ,

(8)

be the cartan generators in the dening representation of su(n ); and let s(k)
sponding generators at site n,

n be the corre-

s(k)
n = 1  . . .  1

s(k) 1  . . .  1 ,

n = 1 , . . . , n .

(9)

we denote by s(k) the corresponding total generators acting on the full space of states

n

s(k) =

s(k)
n ,

k = 1 , . . . , n  1 .

(10)

2the hamiltonian with   ( , 2) is related to the parity-transformed hamiltonian with   (0 , ).
explicitly, h() = h(), where  = 2  , and  is the parity [13] operator. an alternative approach
(followed, e.g., in [8],[9]) is to restrict  even further to the range   (0 , 
2 ) and to consider both signs of
the hamiltonian.

2.2 open chain

in addition to an r matrix, the construction of an integrable open spin chain requires also
a solution k of the boundary yang-baxter equation [16]

r12(1  2)k1(1)r21(1 + 2)k2(2) = k2(2)r12(1 + 2)k1(1)r21(1  2) .

(19)

where  is a parameter and l  {1 , . . . , n  1}.

the corresponding open-chain transfer matrix t(l)( ,  , +) is given by [17]-[19],[3]

t(l)( ,  , +) = tr0 m0 k(l) 0(   , +

where the monodromy matrix t0() is given by (5), and t0() is given by

moreover, m is the matrix in the crossing-unitarity relation

(21)

(22)

and is given by the n  n matrix mjk = jkei(n 2j+1), and  = in /2. indeed, it can be
shown that this transfer matrix has the commutativity property

and its derivative at  = 0 gives the hamiltonian,

ht(l)( ,  , +) , t(l)( ,  , +)i = 0 ,

evidently, the parameters  correspond to boundary elds.

an important feature [3] of this model is its exact quantum algebra symmetry uq (su(l))
 uq (su(n  l))  u(1). indeed, let j (k) (k = 1 , . . . , n 1) be raising/lowering operators
of the quantum algebra uq (su(n )) which act on the full space of states, and which obey
the commutation relations

hj +(k) , j (j)i = k,jhs(k)iq

,

hs(k) , j (j)i =  (2k,j  k1,j  k+1,j) j (j) ,

(27)

where [x]q  (qx  qx)/(q  q1), and s(k) is given by eq. (10). for a given value of l,

ht(l)( ,  , +) , s(k)i = 0 ,
ht(l)( ,  , +) , j (k)i = 0 ,

k = 1 , . . . , n  1 ,

(28)

where q = ei. had we taken the k matrix to be the identity matrix k() = 1 instead of
(18), then the corresponding transfer matrix would have the full uq (su(n )) symmetry [18].

the model also has [3] a duality symmetry which relates l  n  l,

u l t(l)( ,  , +) u l  t(n l)( ,  , + + n ) ,

(29)

where u n = 1. this is a remnant of the cyclic (zn ) symmetry [12], [21] of the a(1)
matrix.

3 bulk s matrix

in order to investigate bulk properties, we consider the periodic chain with bethe ansatz
eqs. (12). we assume that the ground state is the bethe ansatz state with no holes, i.e.,
with n  1 lled real fermi seas. holes in these seas correspond to solitons. indeed, the
bethe ansatz state with one hole in the jth sea is a particle-like excited state which belongs
to the fundamental representation [j] of uq (su(n )), corresponding to a young tableau with
a single column of j boxes. such an excitation with rapidity (j) has energy  sin 
 s(j)((j))
and momentum p(j)((j)), where

s(j)() =

exact bulk scattering matrices can be computed using a generalization of the method of
korepin [22] and andrei-destri [23]. we dene the two-particle s matrix r[j][k] for particles
of type [j] and [k] by the momentum quantization condition

for the scalar factor, we obtain (cf. [10])

respectively)

(b) two holes and one 1-string (3-string) of negative parity in the rst sea if  > 2 (  < 2,

it still remains an open problem to determine all n 2 two-particle states. however, let us
assume that the scattering matrix r[1][1] has the same structure as the r matrix (2); i.e.,

r()[1][1] = axj

ejj  ejj + bxj6=k

ejj  ekk + cxj6=k

ejk  ekj ex sign(jk) ,

(38)

3up to signs, which are not easy to obtain from the bethe ansatz, but which can be xed by requiring
that for  = 0 the amplitudes be equal to +1 and 1 respectively; i.e., that the matrix r(0) (see below) be
equal to the permutation matrix.

where a , b , c , x are to be determined. this matrix has the three distinct eigenvalues a , b +
c , b  c, which we identify with the three amplitudes r[1][1]
, r(a) , r(b), respectively. note
that the eigenvalues of r[1][1] are independent of x. that is, the value of x cannot be
determined by considering bethe ansatz states with two holes. we x the value of x (up to
a sign) by requiring that r[1][1] obey the yang-baxter eq. (1).4 in this way, we obtain

(40)

for n = 2, this s matrix agrees with the known result for the xxz chain [25], [13]. moreover,
the scalar factor (36) coincides with the expression given in eq. (3.29) of ref.
[6] for the
a(1)
n scalar factor in ane toda eld theory with imaginary coupling, provided we make the
following identications:

n  n  1 ,

(41)

it has been observed [4]-[6] that (after a certain gauge transformation) this s matrix
has a uq (su(n )) symmetry with q = e
1 . on the other hand, from (28) we see that
the nite-size transfer matrix has an approximate uq (su(n )) symmetry with q = e
 .
evidently, as a result of lling the fermi seas and taking the thermodynamic limit, the value
of q becomes renormalized. (see also e.g. [26].)

(l) [j]  1(cid:17) |(j)i = 0 .

(42)

for simplicity, we consider only the case of a hole of type [1]. the quantum-algebra symmetry
(28) implies that the boundary s matrices k
(l) [1] are diagonal n  n matrices of the same
form as the k matrix (18),

our approach for computing

which leads to the following restriction of parameters: n < 2 + l < 2. in particular, this
requires  > n
2 .

(l) and 

the parameter y can be determined using the boundary yang-baxter eq. (17) (in parallel

with our analysis of the parameter x in the bulk s matrix), and we obtain the value

y =

(49)

our expression for the boundary s matrix agrees with [7]-[9] 6 for n = 2, and with [10]
in the isotropic limit   . a further check on our result is performed in the following
section. finally, we remark that for k+

(l) [1] there are similar expressions involving +.

5 functional equations for boundary s matrix

thus far, we have pursued the direct bethe-ansatz calculation of s matrices. alternatively,
s matrices can be found (up to cdd ambiguities) by the bootstrap approach [28]. indeed,
the bulk s matrix scalar factor (36) was rst obtained for ane toda theory in this way
[4]-[6].

a natural question is whether the boundary s matrix can also be obtained by a boot-
strap approach. for the case that the bulk s matrix has crossing symmetry, ghoshal and
zamolodchikov [7] have formulated a boundary crossing relation, which  together with the
boundary unitarity relation  determines the scalar factor of the boundary s matrix, up to
a boundary cdd ambiguity. unfortunately, the a(1)
n 1 bulk s matrix does not have crossing
symmetry for n > 2, and hence, the ghoshal-zamolodchikov relation cannot be directly
applied.

in this section, we generalize the ghoshal-zamolodchikov boundary crossing relation to
the a(1)
n 1 case, and we nd that the boundary s matrix scalar factor (46),(47) can indeed
be obtained by this bootstrap approach. the basic observation is that, although the bulk s
matrix lacks crossing symmetry, it does have crossing-unitarity symmetry; and one expects
that a corresponding property should hold for the boundary s matrix. 7

we begin by briey reviewing the case that the bulk s matrix does have crossing sym-
metry, and rewriting the ghoshal-zamolodchikov boundary crossing relation in matrix form.
we assume that the bulk s matrix r() has p t symmetry,

r12()t1t2 = r21() ,

(50)

where r21 = p12r12p12, p is the permutation matrix, and ti denotes transposition in the ith
space. we write the bulk crossing relation as

r12()t2 = v1r12(  )v1 ,

(51)

where the crossing matrix v satises v 2 = 1, and  is the crossing parameter. the unitarity
relation is

r12()r21() = 1 .

combining the three relations (50)-(52), one obtains the crossing-unitarity relation

r12(  )t1 m1r12( + )t2 m1

1 = 1 ,

(52)

(53)

where m = v tv . we observe that the ghoshal-zamolodchikov boundary crossing relation
[7] for the boundary s matrix k() is consistent with

7a dierent generalization of the ghoshal-zamolodchikov boundary crossing relation has recently been

tr1hr21(2)m1k1( + )i = (cid:16)v2k2()v2(cid:17)t2

,

(54)

discussed in ref. [29].

9

where r12 = p12r12, and hence r21 = r12p12. (for aesthetic reasons, we have made a shift
in the rapidity variable by /2, but this is not necessary.)

with the help of the boundary unitarity relation

k()k() = 1 ,

one can now obtain the relation

(55)

(56)

tr13hr21(2)m1k1( + )r23(2)m3k3(  )i = 1 .

we shall see below that this relation, which is a boundary generalization of the bulk crossing-
unitarity relation (53), is the desired result.

let us now turn to the a(1)

n 1 bulk s matrix r[1][1]. although it does not have crossing
symmetry, it does obey the crossing-unitarity relation (53) with mjk = jkei(n 2j+1) 
1 ,
and  = in /2 (cf. eq. (22)). we observe that this relation together with the unitarity
relation (52) determine the scalar factor of the bulk s matrix. indeed, substituting the form
(38), (39) into these relations, we obtain the following functional equations for r():

(57)

solving these equations yields the result (40), (36), up to a cdd factor.

finally, we turn to the a(1)

(l) [1]. substituting the form (43), (45),
(48) into the boundary crossing-unitarity relation (56), we obtain a functional equation for
the scalar factor k( , ):

solving these equations yields the result (46), (47) up to a cdd factor.

6 discussion

n 1 quantum spin chain shares a number of features with a(1)

the critical a(1)
n 1 toda quantum
eld theory with imaginary coupling. in particular, the two models have solitonic excita-
tions with the same bulk s matrix. this suggests that the spin chain may be a type of
discretization (see, e.g., [26],[30]) of the ane toda theory. this further suggests that it
may be possible to nd soliton preserving integrable boundary conditions for the ane
toda theory which lead to the boundary s matrix which we have given here. searches for
such integrable boundary conditions have not yet been successful (see, e.g., [31],[32]), but
progress in this direction has recently been reported [33].
(boundary s matrices with a
structure similar to (43) have recently been proposed for the o(n) gross-neveu and nonlin-
ear sigma models [34] and for the so(n) principal chiral model [35].) as in the ane toda
theory, the spin chain has various bound states, on which we hope to report soon.
