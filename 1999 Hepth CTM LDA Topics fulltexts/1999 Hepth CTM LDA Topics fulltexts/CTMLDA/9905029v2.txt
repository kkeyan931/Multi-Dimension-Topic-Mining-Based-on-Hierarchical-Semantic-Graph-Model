we calculate from m-theory the two-dimensional low energy eective dynamics of various

brane congurations. in the rst part we study congurations that have a dual descrip-

tion in type iia string theory as two-dimensional (4, 0) yang-mills theories with gauge

group su(n1)  su(n2) and chiral fermions in the bi-fundamental representation. in

the second part we derive related equations of motion which describe the low energy in-

ternal dynamics of a supersymmetric black hole in four-dimensional n = 1 supergravity,

obtained as an m-vebrane wrapped on a complex four-cycle.

1 introduction

one of the most fascinating aspects of brane dynamics is their ability to predict sophisti-

cated results in quantum eld theories that had previously been studied for many years.

in particular, it has been found that one can predict the low energy eective actions,

including all perturbative and non-perturbative eects. although these predictions can

not be made for a general quantum eld theory, the cases which can be treated in this

way are of considerable interest. from the brane perspective the non-trivial eects often

arise from their classical dynamics and can only be identied with the properties of a

quantum eld theory by using some kind of duality.

in this paper we will use classical brane dynamics to derive the low energy eective

action for a variety of two dimensional quantum eld theories. in the rst part of this

paper we focus on theories that have a interpretation within iia string theory as d-

brane congurations and hence have a yang-mills interpretation. in the second part of

this paper we will use this technique to derive the low energy eective action for four-

dimensional black holes which result from m-vebranes wrapped on a four-cycle of a

six-dimensional calabi-yau manifold.

let us consider the situation in [1] where brane congurations of the form

were analysed. here the d-fourbranes end on the ns-vebranes. from the standard rules

of d-branes the low energy dynamics of this conguration is given by a four-dimensional

n = 2 gauge theory. the technique introduced in [1] was to analyse the strong coupling

picture of this conguration from m-theory. here the entire conguration appears as a

single m-vebrane

the above congurations can be viewed from the worldvolume of the rst m-vebrane.

there (2) appears as a threebrane soliton and (4) appears as a string soliton. in this

case these congurations have the interpretation of a single m-vebrane wrapped around

a calibrated sub-manifold  of eleven-dimensional minkowski space [2, 4]. it was shown

in [2, 4] that (2) and (4) will preserve one half and one quarter of the m-vebrane

supersymmetry respectively if the manifold they dene is complex. by examining the

form of this manifold appearing in (2) one can derive the seiberg-witten curve [5] for a

large class of gauge theories [1]. in addition, from the equations of motion for the m-

vebrane [6] one can derive a four-dimensional n = 2 eective theory for the threebrane

soliton [8, 9, 10]. this is precisely the seiberg-witten low energy eective action [5],

including all non-perturbative eects.

here we will perform a similar analysis of the conguration (3). we will show that it

has a two-dimensional chiral (4, 0) eective yang-mills theory living on the d-fourbrane

intersection. we will derive the general form for the m-theory surface (4) including

all of its moduli. in addition we will explicitly calculate the eective dynamics for the

string soliton (4) and argue that it contains the complete low energy eective dynamics

of two-dimensional yang-mills theory. note that m-theory analysis of two-dimensional

yang-mills theories have already appeared in [11, 12, 13, 14]. however these papers

consider dierent brane congurations, with (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 4) and (0, 2) supersymmetry

respectively, and in particular do not calculate the low energy eective action. the the

eective action for two-dimensional models with (2, 2) supersymmetry were obtained in

[15, 16] using the techniques of geometric engineering in type ii string theory.

one could also view the conguration (4) in m-theory without reference to ten-

dimensional string theory. in this approach, the supersymmetry condition is interpreted

as saying that the m-vebrane is wrapped on a complex four-cycle of c3.

if we con-

sider surfaces that can be compactied then the string soliton can be reduced to ve

dimensions by compactifying m-theory. wrapping the string soliton on an s1 and fur-

2

ther compactifying to four dimensions we obtain a black hole in n = 1 supergravity.

similar black holes were studied in [18, 19] from this point of view and it was found that

their microscopic degrees of freedom correctly accounted for the black holes entropy. in

this paper we will consider surfaces of this type and derive the low energy dynamics of

the corresponding string soliton. this provides a dynamical system of equations for the

internal structure of a black hole at low energies.

the intersecting branes (4) have also been considered from the point of view of the
ads/cft correspondence since the near horizon limit has an ads3  s2  e6 geometry

[17]. one motivation for this work is to help elucidate the relation we between description

of quantum eld theory provided by the m-vebrane and the description found by the

ads/cft conjecture. in general the former is not expected to have exact quantitative

agreement with quantum eld theory whereas the later is. however in this paper we will

argue that exact quantitative information can be obtained from the m-vebrane. thus

this work should help explore a conguration where both approaches are valid.

the rest of this paper is organised as follows. in the next section we analyse the type

iia brane conguration (3) using d-branes. then in section three we go to the strong

string coupling limit of m-theory and analyse the corresponding conguration (4). next

we turn to the problem of calculating the low energy dynamics of this conguration.

in section four we introduce the m-vebrane equations of motion and in section ve we

derive the two-dimensional eective theory. in section six we consider a dierent family of

surfaces, whose brane congurations can be interpreted as black holes in four-dimensions

and derive their low energy eective actions.

2 the type iia brane conguration

let us rst recall the brane conguration (1) discussed in [1]. there one considers two

parallel ns-vebranes in type iia string theory lying in the (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) plane and
separated along the x6 direction by a distance l. one then introduces n1 parallel d-
fourbranes in the (x1, x2, x3, x6) plane, suspended between the two ns-vebranes. the

worldvolume theory on n1 parallel d-fourbrane can be described by open string pertur-

bation theory and at low energy is a ve-dimensional u(n1) gauge theory with sixteen

3

supersymmetries (the equivalent of n = 4 in d = 4). an overall u(1) factor describes

the centre of mass motion of the d-fourbranes and is trivial so we will ignore it. now

consider the presence of the ns-vebranes. these are innitely heavy as compared to the

d-fourbranes (which are now nite in extent along x6). therefore they do not provide

any low energy degrees of freedom. instead they cause the low energy d-fourbrane theory

to be reduced to four dimensions and project out half of the supersymmetry. thus the

eective theory for the conguration is a four-dimensional n = 2 su(n1) yang-mills

theory.

now we go to the strong coupling limit of the string theory given by eleven-dimensional

m-theory. here one must introduce an extra dimension x10 which is compactied on

a circle with radius r. while the ns-vebranes are now simply m-vebranes the d-

fourbranes become m-vebranes wrapped around the x10 dimension. thus we arrive at

the m-theory conguration (2). indeed the whole conguration can be viewed as a single

m-vebrane wrapped over a manifold sw . it was shown in [1] that sw was precisely

the known seiberg-witten elliptic curve appearing in the complete low energy eective

action for n = 2 su(n1) yang-mills theory [5] (see also [20] for a similar role of the m-

vebrane). in addition by studying the dynamics of the m-vebrane one can determine

the low energy eective action including an innite number of instanton corrections [8].

thus the classical dynamics of the m-vebrane is capable of predicting exact coecients

in four-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills theory.

in this paper we wish to study in a similar way the type iia brane conguration (3)
obtained by including n2 additional d-fourbranes to (1) in the (x1, x4, x5, x6) plane. thus

the intersection between the two d-fourbranes is a three-dimensional space. however the

ns-vebranes insure that the x6 dimension is nite and hence the low energy theory

is two-dimensional. in addition the extra d-fourbranes project out another half of the

supersymmetries leaving only four supercharges. to see this consider the large string

coupling constant limit where the conguration (3) is lifted to the m-theory conguration

(4). the three m-vebranes in (4) preserve the supersymmetries

012345 =  , 0123610 =  , 0145610 =  .

(5)

4

it follows that the remaining four supersymmetries are chiral

01 =  ,

(6)

and hence the two-dimensional low energy theory has (4, 0) supersymmetry.

now consider the the eld theory living on the d-brane intersection. at weak coupling

this is obtained by standard d-brane techniques and is given in [21]. as mentioned above

the intersecting d-fourbranes reduce the ve-dimensional eld theory to three dimensions.
note also that there is a trivial so(3) = su(2) symmetry from the x7, x8, x9 dimensions.
this leads to an su(2) r-symmetry group. if we now add the ns-vebranes we must

dimensionally reduce the system to two dimensions. the counting of massless states gives

the following modes in terms of two-dimensional n = (4, 4) super-multiplets. from open

strings that begin and end on the d-fourbranes parallel to (x1, x2, x3, x6) we obtain a

vector-multiplet with gauge group su(n1) (here  = 0, 1 and  = 1, 2)

a, a,


a, a

where a = x 4 + ix 5 and a = a2 + ia3. there is also a hyper-multiplet

x 7, x 8, x 9, a6,


a

(7)

(8)

which is in the adjoint representation of su(n1) (since the over-all centre of mass degree
of freedom naturally decouples we have su(n1) instead of u(n1)). here x d is the
scalar eld representing the uctuation of the d-fourbrane in the xd direction and am
is the component of the worldvolume gauge eld in the xm direction. there are similar

multiplets

where b = x 2 + ix 3, b = b4 + ib5 and

b, b,


b, b

x 7, x 8, x 9, b6,


b

(9)

(10)

in the adjoint of su(n2) found by examining the open strings that begin and end on the
d-fourbranes parallel to the (x1, x4, x5, x6) plane. so in total we have a vector-multiplet

and a hyper-multiplet in the adjoint of su(n1)  su(n2). note that these states are

5

simply the dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional n = 1 super-yang-mills-multiplets

reduced to two dimensions. these two multiplets are by themselves insensitive to each

other and hence preserve the full (8, 8) supersymmetry (i.e.

the same as a single d-

fourbrane).

in addition there is a hyper-multiplet

1, 2, 3, 4, 



(11)

coming from open strings stretching between the two types of d-fourbrane [21]. these

states transform in the fundamental representation of u(n1)  u(n2). again, since a

u(1)  u(1) factor of this group is trivial, the interacting part of the hyper-multiplet

is in the fundamental representation of su(n1)  su(n2). these states mediate the

interaction between the two factors of the gauge group (i.e. the interactions between the

two types of d-fourbranes) and break the supersymmetry to (4, 4).

the ns-vebranes do not just dimensionally reduce the three-dimensional intersection

to two dimensions. it was pointed out in [22] that they also impose boundary conditions

where the d-fourbranes meet the ns-vebranes which can eliminate zero modes and

break additional supersymmetries. following this argument let us consider the adjoint

hyper-multiplets. these elds represent uctuations of the d-fourbranes in the directions

transverse to the ns-vebranes and, since the d-fourbranes must end on the ns-vebrane,

we must impose dirichlet boundary conditions so that the scalar elds x 7, x 8, x 9 vanish

at x6 = 0, l. this implies that they are massive modes (with massive of order the

string scale) and hence they do not appear in the low energy yang-mills theory. this

argument applies separately to each type of d-fourbrane, as in the construction of [1],

and so it follows that the (4, 4) superpartners a6, b6, a, b are massive too. on the

other hand the vector multiplets represent the uctuations of the d-fourbranes within

the ns-vebranes and need not vanish at x6 = 0, l. instead we simply impose neumann

boundary conditions which leave zero modes for all the elds in the (4, 4) multiplet.

the boundary conditions imposed on the bi-fundamental hyper multiplet are more

dicult to analysis since they do not have a straightforward geometrical interpretation.

to this end a more formal argument can be constructed which reproduces the above mass-

less modes for the adjoint multiplets and also shows that only the two lowest helicity zero

6

modes of the bi-fundamental hyper multiplet remain and are singlets under supersymme-
try [23], i.e. two helicity  1
modes are a (4, 4) vector multiplet (a, a, 
(4, 4) vector multiplet (b, b, 
fermions a

2 fermions. to summarise, the surviving two-dimensional zero
a, a) with gauge group su(n1), a second
b, b) with gauge group su(n2) and two right-handed
 in the fundamental of su(n1)  su(n2). these right-handed fermions
are singlets under spacetime supersymmetry leaving (4, 0) supersymmetry on the two-

dimensional intersection.

note that the vector multiplet elds can carry momentum o the intersection (i.e. in

the x2, x3, x4, x5 directions), although the bi-fundamental fermions only propagate along

x0, x1. without the bi-fundamental fermions the two gauge groups do not interact and

can equally be viewed as a single four-dimensional n = 2 su(n1)  su(n2) gauge

theory. therefore the resulting eective dynamics we obtain more accurately describe

a one-dimensional defect in a four-dimensional n = 2 su(n1)  su(n2) gauge theory.

however, since the interactions between the two dierent gauge groups propagate only

in two dimensions, the eective dynamics we obtain should contain the full description

of an interacting (4, 0) su(n1)  su(n2) two-dimensional gauge theory.

let us consider rst the theory on the rst d-fourbrane in the (x1, x2, x3, x6) plane.

the ns-vebranes cause the x6 dimension to be compact with length l. therefore the
four-dimensional yang-mills coupling constant gy m is given by the ratio g2
y m = gs/l
where gs = r3/2 is the string coupling constant [1]. it follows that we may go to the large

distance, small curvature limit r, l   keeping the couplings xed. in this limit m-

theory is well described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. thus the eective description

that we obtain from m-theory should be accurate for any value of the yang-mills coupling

constant. in fact we will see that, as is the case for the n = 2 theories, the parameter

r does not appear in the low energy dynamics, which are therefore insensitive to the

extra dimension. another important restriction on the low energy terms is that they are

holomorphic. one may therefore expect some kind of non-renormalisation theorem that

ensures they are the correct terms for the yang-mills theory. thus we can conjecture

on the basis of type iia/m-theory duality that we will arrive at the exact quantum low

energy eective action.

7

3 the m-vebrane geometry

let us now pass to the strong coupling m-theory picture. the d-fourbranes then lift

to m-vebrane conguration (4).

indeed, as in [1], all branes are m-vebranes which

can in turn be described by a single self-intersecting m-vebrane with a complicated

worldvolume. the intersection (4) can then be viewed as a supersymmetric string soliton

on the worldvolume of the rst m-vebrane. our approach is to derive the dynamics of the

d-fourbrane intersection gauge theory by calculating the classical low energy dynamics

of this string soliton of the m-vebrane.

to perform the m-theory analysis it is useful to introduce the complex coordinates

s = x 6 + ix 10 ,

t = es/r , w = x2 + ix3 ,

z = x4 + ix5 .

(12)

it was shown in [4] that the soliton (4) is a solution to the m-vebrane equations of motion

and preserves one quarter of the sixteen supersymmetries if s(z, w) is a holomorphic func-

tion. this has the interpretation of wrapping the m-vebrane around a four-dimensional

complex submanifold  of c3 with coordinates t, z, w. equivalently we may embed the

m-vebrane in spacetime by a function of the form f (t, z, w) = 0. our rst task then is

to generalise the construction in [1] and identify the appropriate complex surface for (4)

and its moduli.

we are interested here in manifolds  which correspond to two ns-vebranes in the

x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 plane in ten dimensions. in this case we need two possible values of

t for every point (z, w), i.e. we need a two-sheeted cover of the (z, w) plane. thus we

assume that f (t, z, w) takes the form

a(z, w)t2  2b(z, w)t + c(z, w) = 0 .

(13)

we do not want to consider here a conguration where there are semi-innite d-fourbranes

coming o the two ns-vebranes. to ensure this we must set a and c to constants, so

that t is neither zero nor innite (corresponding to s = ) for any nite value of z

and w. without loss of generality this leads to a = 1 and c = . by rescaling t and
b we can also set  = 1. to obtain n1 d-fourbranes in the (x1, w, x6) plane and n2
d-fourbranes in the (x1, z, x6) plane we must chose b to be a polynomial of degree n1 in

8

z and degree n2 in w. the most general form for b can be written as

b(z, w) = zn1wn2  p(w)zn1  q(z)wn2

zn11wn21  r1(w)zn11  r2(z)wn21

+r(z, w) .

(14)

here  and  are constants, p and r1 are polynomials of degree n2  1 and n2  2 in w

respectively, q and r2 are polynomials of degree n1  1 and n1  2 in z respectively and

r(z, w) is a polynomial of degree n1  2 in z and n2  2 in w.

we can set  = 1 by rescaling z and w. this leaves (n1 + 1)(n2 + 1)  1 coecients

in b to determine. to this end we imagine that t is xed. this gives us a surface in the

z, w plane representing the two types of intersecting d-fourbranes. for large z with w

xed this surface takes the form

z(wn2  p(w))  (qn11wn2 + bwn21 + r1(w)) = 0 ,

(15)

where qn11 is the leading coecient in q(z) and we have ignored lower order terms. to

describe the intersecting brane conguration we require that for large z we go to a xed

value of w, representing a d-fourbrane in the (x1, z, x6) plane. in addition there should

be a symmetry between z   and z  . this requires that both terms in (15)

vanish separately. in particular we must be at a zero of wn2  p(w) and if we write

wn2  p(w) =

n2

(w  wi) ,

yi=1

(16)

then we can interpret the wi as the locations of the n2 d-fourbranes in the (x1, z, x6)

plane. we can also shift the w coordinate so that the centre of mass is frozen at w = 0,

thereby setting pi wi = 0. this means that p(w) is in fact only of degree n2  2.

similarly, by examining the large w limit, we write

zn1  q(z) =

n1

(z  zi) ,

yi=1

(17)

and interpret the zi as the locations of the n1 d-fourbranes in the (x1, w, x6) plane. by

a shift in the z coordinate we can set the centre of mass to z = 0. again this means that

pi zi = 0 and q(z) is only of degree n1  2.

9

it also follows from (15) that the polynomial (recall that now qn11 = 0)

wn21 + r1(w) ,

(18)

has n2 roots precisely at the points wi. but this is a polynomial of degree n2  1

and therefore it can only have n2 roots if it is identically zero. hence we must have

 = r1(w) = 0. similarly from the large w analysis we nd that r2(z) = 0. thus b can

be written as

b(z, w) = zn1wn2  p(w)zn1  q(z)wn2 + r(z, w) ,

(19)

where now p(w) is of degree n2  2 and q(z) is of degree n1  2.

thus we nd that there are (n1  1) + (n2  1) moduli coming from the polynomials

p and q and also (n1  1)(n2  1) moduli from the polynomial r which we write in the

form

r(z, w) =

n11

n21

xi=1

xi=1

uiizi1wi1 .

(20)

we have seen above that we can identify the moduli zi and wi with the positions of the

d-fourbranes. however the moduli in r determine subtle features of the hypersurface

 which are hard to see in the large z, w limit where we can clearly identify distinct

d-fourbranes. it follows from m-theory/type iia duality that we can associate to the

d-brane yang-mills theory the complex hyper-surface in c3 given by

y2 = "zn1 yi

(w  wi) + wn2yi

(z  zi)  zn1wn2 +xii

uiizi1wi1#2

 1 ,

(21)

where y = t  b. clearly for w (z) xed to a constant this surface reduces to the

seiberg-witten curve for n = 2 su(n1) (su(n2)) gauge theory after a trivial rescaling.

it will be helpful to re-derive this surface by considering only features of the two

four-dimensional su(n) gauge theories. from this point of view we want to construct a

complex surface of the form

y2 = b2  1 ,

(22)

with b a polynomial of degree n1 in z and n2 in w. furthermore we require that

the coecients in b are constructed from scalar gauge invariant operators of the four-

dimensional yang-mills theories. it is easy to see that for the groups su(n1) and su(n2)

10

the only independent such operators are (i = 1, ..., n1  1 , i = 1, ..., n2  1)

zi = tr(an1+1i) ,
wi = tr(bn2+1i
uii = tr(an1+1ibn2+1i

) ,

) .

(23)

in the brane conguration (3) the so(1, 9) lorentz group is broken down to so(1, 1)

so(3)so(2)so(2) corresponding to the two-dimensional lorentz group and rotations

in the (x7, x8, x9), (x4, x5) and (x2, x3) planes respectively. these last three transforma-

tions appear in the gauge theory as an su(2)  u(1)  u(1) r-symmetry. if we consider

the four-dimensional su(n) gauge theory on each type of d-fourbrane (and ignore the

presence of the other type of d-fourbrane) then the corresponding u(1) r-symmetry is

broken by quantum eects to z2n . this group is generated by

a  e

i

n1 a ,

b  e

i

n2 b .

(24)

thus if we denote the weights of a eld under z2n1  z2n2 by (p, q) then the operators

transform as

zi = (n1 + 1  i, 0) ,

wi = (0, n2 + 1  i) ,

uii = (n1 + 1  i, n2 + 1  i) .

we require that z2n1  z2n2 must be a symmetry of the surface. let us write

b =

n1

xk=0

n2

xl=0

ck,lzkwl

(25)

(26)

and normalise the leading term cn1,n2 = 1. noting that b  b is a symmetry of

the surface we see that we can assign the variables z and w the weights (1, 0) and (0, 1)

respectively under z2n1  z2n2. now consider an arbitrary term in b. invariance of b

(up to a minus sign) then tells us that ck,l must have weight (n1  k, n2  l). thus we

11

identify

ci1,n2 = zi ,

cn1,i1 = wi ,

ci1,i1 = uii .

(27)

however the coecients of the sub-leading terms cn11,l and ck,n21 have weights (1, n2 

l) and (n1  k, 1) respectively. since there are no gauge invariant operators with these

dimensions we must set cn11,l = ck,n21 = 0. thus we nd

b = zn1wn2 +xi

zizi1wn2 +xi

wizn1wi1 +xii

uiizi1wi1 .

(28)

this is precisely the same surface that we obtained from the geometry of the intersecting

branes with uii = uii, zi identied with the symmetric polynomial of degree n1 + 1  i
in zi and wi identied with the symmetric polynomial of degree n2 + 1  i in wi.

just as was the case for the n = 2 models this picture also suggests that the moduli

of surface are the scalar modes in the low energy eective description of the yang-mills

theory. however one can easily see that not all of these scalar modes are dynamical in

the low energy m-vebrane theory. to see this consider the dynamics of the scalar modes

alone (i.e. ignore for now the three-form eld h). in this case the m-vebrane dynamics

are given by the standard p-brane action

where gmn is the induced metric

s = z d6xqdetg ,

gmn = mn +

1

msns +

msns .

(29)

(30)

expanding this expression out to second order in two-dimensional derivatives gives, ig-

noring a surface term,

to evaluate the low energy scalar dynamics we promote the moduli of the surface to

s =

2 z d2xd2wd2zss .

(31)

two-dimensional scalar elds so that

s = xi

(32)

12

substituting this into the action s one nds non-convergent integrals (in the large z, w

limit) coming from the kinetic terms for the zi and wi moduli. thus we are forced to set

the positions of the d-fourbranes zi(x) and wi(x) to constants in the low energy theory.

this is not unexpected since the d-fourbranes are innitely heavy from the point of view

of the two-dimensional intersection.

from the alternative derivation of the surface (21) above we also see that we must

identify the moduli with the vacuum expectation values of the gauge invariant operators

(23). in particular the zi and wi are the n1  1 and n2  1 components of a and b in the

cartan subalgebra of su(n1) and su(n2) respectively. using supersymmetry it follows

that the superpartners of these elds, namely a, b, a, b, are also non-dynamical.

this leaves us with (n1  1)(n2  1) complex moduli uii and their superpartners which

we expect to have smooth nite energy behaviour at low energy. from the above analysis

we see that these are identied with the composite gauge theory operators

uii = tr(an1+1ibn2+1i

) .

4 the m-fivebrane equations and soliton dynamics

before proceeding to analyse the dynamics of the conguration (4) we must rst discuss

the equations of motion for the the m-vebrane in at eleven-dimensional spacetime. we

then use these to nd the equations of motion for the low energy motion of our string

soliton solution on the m-vebrane worldvolume. we will use the equations of motion

found in [6] from the superembedding approach applied to the m-vebrane [7].

the bosonic elds of the m-vebrane consist of a closed three-form hmnp and ve

scalars x a
worldvolume coordinates by xm, m = 0, 1, 2, .., 5 and tangent frame indices by a, b, c =

, a = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, representing the transverse uctuations. we denote the

0, 1, 2, ..., 5. the two-dimensional coordinates x0, x1 are denoted by x. the complex

coordinates z, w and z, w are denoted by z and z  respectively. the scalar elds dene

a worldvolume metric and vielbein

gmn = mn + mx a

nx a

,

= abe a

m e b
n ,

13

obtained through the pull-back of the at eleven-dimensional metric.

in the full non-linear theory the three-form hmnp satises a complicated self-duality

constraint. this is obtained by rst considering a (linearly) self-dual three-form hmnp

(34)

hmnp =

1
3!

mnpqrshqrs ,

which is not assumed to be closed. we can then construct the tensor

m b

a =  b

a  2hacdhbcd ,

and dene

hmnp = e a

m e b

n e c

p (m1) d

c habd .

(35)

(36)

(37)

thus hmnp satises a non-linear self-duality constraint inherited from the (linear) self-

duality of hmnp.

we may now write the equations of motion for the bosonic elds in the form [6]

gmnmnx a

= 0 ,

gmnmhnpq = 0 ,

where

gmn = e m

a e n

b m a

c m b

d cd ,

(38)

(39)

is a second metric incorporating the three-form eld. if hmnp is constructed as above

and hence satises its non-linear self-duality constraint then the second equation in (38)

is equivalent to the closure of hmnp [6].

to nd the low energy motion of the string soliton it is sucient to consider only

terms up to second order in spacetime derivatives  and the three-form hmnp. in this

case we may simply write

hmnp = e a

m e b

n e c

p habc .

(40)

it is understood in (40) that h appears in the worldvolume frame and h in the tangent

frame.

14

once the self-duality condition on h is satised the low energy equations of motion

for the m-vebrane are found from (38) to be

s  "ss s

1 + |s|2 #  4h 

mn h mns = 0 ,

(41)

for the scalar elds, where |s|2 = |zs|2 + |ws|2. for the three-form we may simply use

[mhnpq] = 0 .

(42)

here we have assumed that only the two scalars x 6 and x 10 are non-constant.

in

particular the closure of hmnp gives several equations

[h] = 0 ,

[h ] = 0 ,

[h] = 0 ,

[h ] = 0 ,

and their complex conjugates.

to obtain the low energy motion for the soliton we let its moduli depend on x and

substitute the form for s(z, w) into these equations. we must then dimensionally reduce

the scalar equations to two-dimensions. following the methods of [9] we consider

(43)

z(s  " ss s

1 + |s|2 #  4h 

mn h mns) dz  dw  i = 0 ,

(44)

where the i are a basis for h 2(). for the three-form we consider only those equations

which are second order in spacetime indices  to be equations of motion. for these we

consider

[h]dz  dz  i = 0 ,

[h ]dz  dz

  i = 0 .

z
z

(45)

this leaves us with the last two equations in (43) which we view as constraints (along

with self-duality) on hmnp.

15

it is helpful at this point to list the non-vanishing components of the vielbein

q1 + |s|2  1

plus their complex conjugates. in this paper we will only consider ansatze for the three-

(46)

form which satisfy

from (40) we nd that

h = 0 .

h = o(()2) ,

and it follows from (35) that h = o(()2). thus we simply nd

h = e 

 e 

 h , h  = e 
 e


 h  ,

(47)

(48)

(49)

where h is in the world frame and h is in the tangent frame. we may now consider

ansatze for h and h  of the form

h = u , h  = v +

 +

  + v 

 

  ,

(50)

where we have chosen 
this into the self-duality condition we learn that u = u  and v 

 dz  dz  to be (anti-) self-dual forms on . substituting
 = v  are

two-dimensional chiral elds.

if we assume that the three elds u and v 

in (43) implies that dz  dz and 

 are independent then the third equation
 dz  dz  are closed (2, 0) and (1, 1) forms on 
respectively. it is not hard to see that a non-zero h would correspond to (1, 0) forms

on . finally we must consider the fourth equation in (43). we expect that this equation

leads to no additional constraints on h. the reason for this is that if we integrate it over

the manifold  we obtain the constraint

z

[h ]dz  dz  dz   dz

 = z

dh = 0 ,

(51)

16

which is identically true if  has no boundary or if the elds which vanish at innity.

thus the ansatze for chiral the elds on a general  takes the form

h =

b(2,0)

xi=1

ui i

 , h  =

b+(1,1)

xi=1

v +
i +i

  +

b(1,1)

xi=1

ii
v 

  .

(52)

here i, +i and i form basis of h (2,0)(), h +(1,1)() and h (1,1)() respectively,

where h (1,1)() is the (anti-) self-dual subgroup of h (1,1)(). the index i is understood

to run over the dimension of the appropriate cohomology group. the rst two equations
in (43) now give the following three equations for ui, v +

i and v 
i

0 = [u]j j + [uau]j

0 = [v

(55)

where ua are the moduli for the surface s(z, w). it is easy to see that only those i in

h (0,2)() give a non-vanishing contribution to the integrals in (55). we also note that if
 = 0 then the equations of motion for the scalars ua can be derived from the

if u = v 

17

action (31). however this only leads to the rst two terms in (55). thus we expect that

the third integral in (55) always vanishes. this is not surprising since, for (0, 2) forms

i, the integrand is a total derivative. we also nd the following equations for the chiral

elds

0 = [v +

0 = [u]j z

since the wedge product of a self-dual and an anti-self-dual form vanishes, it follows that
the only non-vanishing integrals in the equations for u, v +
 come from i in

5 eective dynamics of two-dimensional yang-mills

theories

in this section we will explicitly derive the low energy eective dynamics for an m-

vebrane wrapped around a four-cycle given by (21). this can then be interpreted as

the m-theory prediction for the low energy eective theory of the two-dimensional (4, 0)

yang-mills theory.

before we proceed we must construct a suitable ansatz for hmnp. a non-zero hz

would lead to vector modes in the low energy dynamics and since these contain no

propagating degrees of freedom we set them to zero. in addition, in this section it will be

sucient to consider h  = 0, which we will justify below. thus we are only concerned

with the rst equation in (50) corresponding to (2, 0) forms on . it is not hard to check

that a basis of normalisable (2, 0) forms is given by

ii



zi1wi1

y

dz  dw = 

1
r

s
uii

dz  dw ,

(57)

18

where y is given by (21). thus the general form for h is

h = xii

uiiii

 .

(58)

since we have set h = h  = 0 one nds that the scalar equation of motion

simplies to

s  "ss s

1 + |s|2 # = 0 .

(59)

performing the reduction of the equations of motion given in the last section yields

uiii ii jj 

+ uiiukk

i ii jj 
ukk

+ uiiukkk ii kk jj 

= 0 ,

(60)

(61)

(62)

.

since the integrand is a total derivative, and the singularities are mild, it is not hard
to see that k ii kk jj 

= 0, as we expected in the previous section. thus we nd the

equations of motion

uiii ii jj 

+ uiiukk

i ii jj 
ukk

,

(63)

for the (n1  1)(n2  1) complex scalars uii. indeed the above equations of motion are

then precisely those of the action obtain by dimensionally reducing (31). in this way we

nd the the two-dimensional action

s = z d2xuii ujj i ii jj 

,

(64)

for the scalars uii.

next we must consider the equation of motion for h. this is obtained using (56)

to give

[u]iii ii jj 

+ [ukku]ii

i ii jj 
ukk

= 0 .

(65)

here we nd chiral equations of motion for (n1  1)(n2  1) complex bosons. we have

yet to account for the zero modes of h . these are obtained from (1, 1)-forms on .
however, since we have accounted for all of the low energy elds of the d-fourbranes,

19

these elds, if any exist, are not zero modes of our worldvolume string soliton and so we

are justied in ignoring them.

before ending this section we will make some observations about the eective action

that we have derived. for concreteness let us consider the simplest case where n1 =

n2 = 2, i.e. for the group su(2)  su(2). we therefore have only one complex scalar

mode u and the surface (21) takes the form

y2 = hz2w2  w2

0z2  z2

0w2 + ui2

 1 .

(66)

the equations of motion for the elds are now

ui + uu

[u]i + [uu]

i
u
i
u

= 0 ,

= 0 ,

i = z

   = z d2wd2z

y y

.

with

one can show by a straightforward change of variables that i can be written as

where

i = z

isw (2  u) ,

isw (x)  z d2

1

|( 2  x)2  1|

,

(67)

(68)

(69)

(70)

is the standard four-dimensional seiberg-witten elliptic integral for su(2) (in the nota-
tion of [5], isw (u) = |da/du|2im ). from the known form for this function [5] one sees

that for large x, isw (x)  lnx/|x| so that i is convergent for large . in addition one
can see that the singular points of isw (2  z2
if they occur at a zero of 2  z2

0) are only logarithmic. therefore, even

0w2

0w2

0, i remains nite and well dened.

thus we obtain smooth low energy eective dynamics. furthermore all these quan-

tities are holomorphic and so one is strongly lead to believe that they are in fact the

correct low energy dynamics, including all the quantum corrections. note also that there

is no value for u where i is singular. this is radically dierent to the solution of seiberg

and witten [5] where there are points on the u plane where the low energy eective

20

action is singular (i.e. points where fsw has a logarithmic singularity). as is well known

these points are associated with bps states becoming massless. thus we conclude here

that there are no points on the u plane where extra light degrees of freedom need to

be included. note though that i is singular if z0 = 0 or w0 = 0. this corresponds to

putting two of the parallel d-fourbranes on top of each other, leading to a restoration in

the non-abelian gauge symmetry.

6 black hole eective field theory

let us now consider a dierent form for the surface (4). in particular, consider m-theory

compactied on ms1, where m is a six-dimensional calabi-yau manifold. this results

in four-dimensional n = 1 supergravity for the m-theory low energy eective action. if

we wrap the m-vebrane on a four-cycle in m and then the resulting string soliton

over the s1 we obtain a black hole in four dimensions, which is a bps solution of the

supergravity theory. the entropy of this black hole was found in [18, 19] by computing

the number of degrees of freedom of the black hole. the latter arise from the moduli

of the embedded cycle, the three-form eld of the vebrane, as well as the momenta on

the s1. these are the same elds that we discussed in section four above. therefore

in this section we will use the analysis described in section four to compute the precise

eective low energy dynamics of the wrapped m-vebrane. just as for the previous case

we obtain the low energy dynamics by letting the moduli of the m-vebrane string soliton

depend on the x coordinates. although we do not carry out the remaining s1 reduction,

this is straightforward and yields the low energy dynamics of the back hole. again the

resulting scalar degrees of freedom posses (4, 0) supersymmetry. eective actions for the

conformal eld theory of black hole internal degrees of freedom have also been constructed

in [24, 25, 26] in other contexts.

a key dierence with the work in the previous section is that we now consider four-

dimensional hypersurfaces  of a six-dimensional complex space that can be compactied.

in fact, we will consider any such  which has no (1, 0) or (0, 1) forms. however we will

continue to use the m-vebrane equations of motion in a at background. it is hoped

that the resulting system of equations provide a good description of an m-vebrane

21

wrapped on a four-cycle of a six-dimensional calabi-yau manifold.

in principle it is

straightforward to modify our results by using the m-vebrane equations of motion in a

curved background [6].

since we consider  to have no one-cycles we set again set h = 0. however now

we need to consider the full m-vebrane dynamics, including zero modes of h . again
we follow the discussion in section four. the scalar elds that arise from the moduli of

 obey the eld equation arising from the scalar eld s = x 6 + ix 10. in two-dimensions

this is reduced to

0 = uaz
4 uj v 

s

ua dz  dw  i + uaubz
k z(cid:16)gg g j

 s(cid:17) dz  dw  i ,

k

2s

uaub dz  dw  i

(71)

where we have dropped the total derivative term in (55). as is clear from this equation,

if there are anti-self-dual (1, 1) forms on  then we see that there will be quadratic terms

in h in the scalar equation. the three-form eld is again expanded as in (52) and we

nd the equations of motion

[u]ik ij + [uau]i

[v +

]ij ij + [uav +

]i

[v 

]ilij + [uav 

]i 

k ij
ua = 0 ,
j ij
ua = 0 ,
lij
ua = 0 ,

(72)

where ua are the moduli of the surface (which are the scalars in the two-dimensional

theory) and

k ij = z

i  j ,

j ij = z

+i  +j , lij = z

i  j .

(73)

the above equations for the three-form eld moduli do not apparently depend on

many of the detailed features of the vebrane dynamics. however, this can not be said

of the equation of motion for the ua as a result of the last term in (71). these introduce

complicated non-holomorphic integrals which are dicult to evaluate in general (although

it seems likely that they can be evaluated along the lines used in [10]). let us therefore

concentrate here on the equations of motion for the chiral elds.

22

the j, k and l integrals in (73) can in general be evaluated using a riemann bilinear

relation of the form

z

   = (1)ij zai

zaj

 ,

(74)

where ij is the intersection form of  and ai are a basis of homology 2-cycles, i, j =
1, 2, ..., b2().

since the space of two-forms in the second de rham cohomology and the space of

two-cycles of  are isomorphic, we can choose the two-cycles to be dual to the two-forms

inherited from the underlying complex structure. thus there exists a division of cycles
into c i, c i and c i

, with the index range understood to depend on which cycles are

referred to, such that

zc i

wj = j

i , z c i

wj = j

i , zc i



wj = j
i

(75)

with all other integrals zero. with this choice of basis the riemann bilinear identity

implies that the integrals in equation (73) are just given by the inverse of the intersection
matrix, for example kij = (i 1)ij (note that the range of the indices varies so j, k and

l are distinct). we note that this choice of basis is not that usually used in the physics

literature. often the intersection matrix is assumed to have a simple form, which does

not depend on the moduli of the surface, whereas the self-duality condition on the forms

contains a moduli dependent matrix. the integral of the forms over the two-cycles then

leads to the period matrix of the manifold. given an arbitrary set of forms and their

self-duality properties it is a matter of linear algebra to compute the transformation on

the cycles to nd a basis that satises (75).

to illustrate this point, let us consider a riemann surface of genus one which has a

canonical set of one cycles a and b with the intersection matrix  =   0

1

1

0!, and a

holomorphic one-form . we can always normalise  such that

changing to the one cycles c, c by

 = 1 ,

za

c = 



  

a +

1

  

b ,

c =



  

a 

1

  

b

23

(76)

(77)

the integrals take the simple form

zc

 = 1 ,zc

 = 0, z c

 = 0, z c

 = 1 .

however, the intersection matrix becomes

 = 

1

(   )   0

1

1

0! .

(78)

(79)

in light-cone coordinates, x  = x 0  x 1, the self-duality conditions on ui and v 

are readily analysed. indeed the only non-vanishing components of ui are ui and the
only non-vanishing components of v 

+i. the above equation of motions
then take a very simple form with the above choice of cycles. for example, the equation

i are v +

i and v 

for ui becomes

+uk + +uaui(i 1)ij i jk

ua = 0 ,

(80)

and there are similar equations for v 

i.

thus we nd a system of equations which describe the two-dimensional motion of

scalar degrees of freedom. the ua scalars which arise from the moduli of the four-cycle

are neither left nor right moving, but the scalars the arise from the three-form eld are

either left handed or right handed, depending on the (anti-) self-duality of the two-cycle

they correspond to. these equations describe the motion of the degrees of freedom of a

black string, but making a trivial reduction on s1 we nd equations that describe the

internal dynamics of a black hole.

clearly, these equations are classically superconformally invariant, but their (4, 0)

supersymmetry is not enough to ensure that they are superconformally invariant at the

quantum level due to anomalies (see for example [27]). however, since these equations

arise from an abelian m-vebrane which should have a consistent quantum theory, we

might expect these equations to be superconformally invariant in the full quantum theory.

this is also expected since the near horizon limit has an ads3 structure [17]. one can also

enquire if the above system of dynamics is integrable. clearly, their conformal invariance

implies that they possess an innite number of conserved quantities, whose currents are

polynomials and moments of the energy momentum tensor. however, this not necessarily

sucient for integrability, since they may not distinguish between all the physical states.

24

finally, since the vebrane equations of motion are known in the presence of a non-

trivial background [6], one could repeat the derivation in the presence of the background

to nd the low energy dynamics of the black hole in the presence of other matter. in this

system one could study the interaction of external matter and a black hole in detail.
