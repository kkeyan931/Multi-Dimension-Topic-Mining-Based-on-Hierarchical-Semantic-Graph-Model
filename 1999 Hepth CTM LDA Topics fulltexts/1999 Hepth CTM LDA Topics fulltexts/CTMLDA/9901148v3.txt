abstract

we review some aspects of three-dimensional quantum gravity with
emphasis in the cft  geometry map that follows from the brown-
henneaux conformal algebra. the general solution to the classical
equations of motion with anti-de sitter boundary conditions is dis-
played. this solution is parametrized by two functions which become
virasoro operators after quantisation. a map from the space of states
to the space of classical solutions is exhibited. some recent proposals
to understand the bekenstein-hawking entropy are reviewed in this
context. the origin of the boundary degrees of freedom arising in
2+1 gravity is analysed in detail using a hamiltonian chern-simons
formalism.

1 introduction

general relativity is a highly complicated non-linear eld theory both clas-
sically and quantum mechanically. even though a large number of classical
solutions exists, a general classication of the space of solutions has never
been achieved. the non-renormabizibility of quantum gravity is not related
to this issue, but if the general structure of the space of solutions of the ein-
stein equations was known, then the quantum version of phase space perhaps
would be more manageable.

it is this aspect of three-dimensional gravity that makes it attractive
because the general solution to the equations of motion can be written down.

1

in this paper, we shall exploit this fact trying to formulate a quantum theory
of black holes by quantizing the space of solutions directly.

another important aspect of three-dimensional gravity is its formulation
as a chern-simons theory[1]. quantum chern-simons theory is well un-
derstood for compact groups[2, 3, 4]. however, we shall be interested in eu-
clidean gravity with a negative cosmological constant whose associated group
is sl(2, c), which is not compact. the quantization is then not straight-
forward. we shall follow an alternative route by rst solving the equations
of motion with prescribed boundary conditions and then quantise. we shall
see that the boundary conditions will play an important role in making the
quantum theory well-dened.

1.1 brief description of the results contained in this

article

let us start by briey mentioning, without proofs, the main results which
will be of interest for us here. the relevant proofs will be given below. we
should remark at this point that most of the results presented here are known
in the literature in various contexts (the relevant quotations will be given in
the main text). the aim of this article is to put things together in a self-
contained framework, and to explore some aspects of quantum black holes in
three dimensions.

let m be a three dimensional manifold with a boundary denoted by m.
we assume that m has the topology of a 2-torus. let {w, w, } coordinates
on m such that the boundary is located at e =: lr  , and w =  + it,
w =   it are complex coordinates on the torus. the three-dimensional
metric 1,

ds2 = 4gl(ldw2 + ld w2) +(cid:16)l2e2 + 16g2l le2(cid:17) dwd w + l2d2,

where l = l(w) and l = l( w) are arbitrary functions of their arguments
satises the following properties:

(1)

(i) exact solution
the metric (1) is an exact solution to the three-dimensional vacuum einstein
equations with a negative cosmological constant  = 1/l2. the leading

1g represents newtons constant and l is the anti-de sitter radius related to a negative

cosmological constant by  = 1/l2. we set h = 1 throughout the paper.

2

and rst subleading terms of (1) (in powers of r = e) are, of course, the
ones dictated by the general analysis of [5] for asymptotically anti-de sitter
spacetimes. what is perhaps not so well-known is that adding the term
e2l l, the metric becomes an exact solution. most importantly, (1) is the
most general solution, up to trivial dieomorphisms, which is asymptotically
anti-de sitter. note that since (1) contains two arbitrary functions, it gives
rise to an innite number of solutions.

we shall work in the euclidean sector of the theory. this means that w
is a complex coordinate related to the spacetime coordinates as w =  + it.
the metric (1) is then complex. as we shall see, this will not bring in any
problems in the quantization. for real values of w, the metric (1) is a solu-
tion to the minkowskian equations of motion.

(ii) physical degrees of freedom
two solutions of the form (1) with dierent values for l and l represent
physically dierent congurations which cannot be connected via a gauge
transformation. in the quantum theory, where l and l will become oper-
ators, dierent expectations values for them will be associated to dierent
solutions.

this is a non-trivial statement. since (1) is a solution to the three-
dimensional einstein equations it has constant curvature and then, locally, is
isometric to anti-de sitter space (see eq. (11) below). the point here is that
the coordinate transformations which change the values of l and l are not
generated by constraints and therefore they are not gauge symmetries. this
point will be analysed in detail in the chern-simons formulation in section
2.3, and in the metric formulation in sec. 4.2.

(iii) residual conformal symmetry
the metric (1) has a residual conformal symmetry. there exists a change of
coordinates {w, w, }  {w, w, } such that the new metric looks exactly
like (1) with new functions l and l. see sec. 4.2 for the proof of this
statement. this change of coordinates is parametrized by two functions (w)
and ( w). the new function l is related to the old one via l = l + l
with,

l = i(l + 2l 

c
12

3)

(2)

3

where c is given by

c =

3l
2g

.

(3)

the same transformation holds for l. thus, under this symmetry, l and l
are quasi-primary elds of conformal dimension 2. this symmetry, properly
dened acting on the gravitational variables, can be shown to be also a global
symmetry of the action[5]. the canonical generators are the functions l and
l themselves and the associated algebra is the virasoro algebra[5],

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m +
where the central charge is dened in (3) and,

c
12

n3n+m,

l(w) = xnz

lneinw.

(4)

(5)

we are using here a non-standard form of the central term. the usual
n(n2  1) form can be obtained simply by shifting the l0 mode as l0 
l0  c/24. this convention is appropriated to the black hole background
which has an exact so(2)  so(2) invariance. see [6] for a discussion on
this point in the supergravity context.

(iv) asymptotic conformal symmetry
the residual symmetry (2) is not an exact symmetry of any background
metric. rather it is a symmetry of the space of solutions described by (1); it
maps one solution into another one. however, this symmetry can be regarded
as an asymptotic symmetry of anti-de sitter space because the r   form of
(1) is asymptotic euclidean ads3 space (note the redenition of coordinates:
w =  + it, r = le),

ds2

(r)  r2(dt2 + d2).

(6)

(we have kept here only the leading terms in powers of r, but note that there
is also a term 2i(l  l)dtd of order one which is allowed by the boundary
conditions[5].) since the asymptotic behaviour (6) does not see l and l it
is invariant under the transformation (2). this symmetry was discovered in
[5]. see [7, 8] for recent discussions.

(v) basic dynamical variables and induced poisson brackets
up to some global issues, the virasoro algebra (4) can be regarded as the basic

4

poisson bracket algebra of the gauge-xed residual variables. in other words,
the functions l(w) and l( w) appearing in (1) are the part of the metric eld
g(x) which survives after the gauge is xed (i.e., after gauge conditions are
imposed and the constraints solved), with anti-de sitter boundary conditions.
the equal-time poisson bracket of general relativity, {ij, gkl} = ij
kl, induces
the virasoro algebra (4) on the residual dynamical functions l and l. a
technical note is convenient here. from the dynamical point of view, l and
l both depend on w and w. however, the gauge-xed equations of motion
read  wl = 0 and w l = 0 leading to l = l(w) and l = l( w).

the identication of the virasoro operators as basic variables is not natu-
ral from the point of view of conformal eld theory. in the standard situation,
the virasoro algebra is associated to a symmetry rather than to the basic
commutator. (a good analogy is to consider the angular momentum compo-
nents li as basic variables, satisfying [li, lj] = iijklk, without knowing the
existence of qi, pj.) one of the main problems of three-dimensional quantum
gravity is to identify what is the conformal eld theory behind the brown-
henneaux conformal symmetry. classically, liouville theory [9] seems to be
a good candidate, however, its quantisation does not give the right counting
for the black hole entropy degeneracy[10]. treating the virasoro algebra as
basic poisson algebra is also well-motivated classically but it does not give
the right counting either (see sec. 4.4). we shall discuss this issues in sec.
4.4, as well as two possible modications of the boundary dynamics which
do provide the right counting of states.

(vi) black holes and ads space
if l and l
the space of solutions described by (1) contains black holes.
are constants (no w, w dependence) with only l0, l0 dierent from zero and
parametrized as

(7)

ml = l0 + l0,

j = l0  l0,

then the metric (1) is globally isometric to the euclidean three-dimensional
black hole [11, 12] of mass m and angular momentum j. eq. (7) means that
the virasoro operators vanish on the vacuum black hole. the corresponding
algebra is (4). the euclidean black hole metric in schwarzschild coordinates
reads

ds2 = l2n 2dt2 + n 2dr2 + r2(d + in dt)2,

(8)

with

n 2(r) = 8mg +
n (r) =

r2 .

l2 +

16g2j 2

,

(9)

(10)

see sec. 4.3 for the explicit transition from (1) to (8).

for m > |j|, this metric has two horizons which are the solutions to the
equation n 2(r) = 0. it is often convenient to dene the euclidean angular
momentum je as je = ij and then the i in (8) does not occur. note also
that in the euclidean sector, the black hole manifold does not see the interior
r < r+. see sec. 4.3 for more details on the relation between (8) and (1).
note that since the coordinates w and w are dened on a torus, the only
globally well-dened solutions are the ones with constant l and l.

for j = 0 and 8mg = 1 the metric (8) reduces to euclidean anti-de

sitter space in three dimensions,

ds2

ads = l2 1 +

r2

l2! dt2 + 1 +

r2

l2!1

dr2 + r2d2.

(11)

(vii) a quantum metric, the cft geometry map and
black hole entropy
once the functions l and l are promoted to be operators acting on fock
space, the metric (1) becomes a well-dened operator, denoted as ds2, on that
space. we then nd a map from focks space (representations of the virasoro
algebra) into the independent classical solutions of einsteins equations. let
| > a state in focks space, we have
| >  ds2

 =< |ds2| >

(12)

with l =< |l| > and l =< | l| >. by construction ds2
 is a
solution to the classical einstein equations because (1) is a solution for ar-
bitrary functions l and l. it also follows that the full set of states | >
generates the full space of classical solutions. note that this map is valid
independently of the structure of the conformal eld theory generating the
virasoro algebra. we can then ask the question of how many states are there
in fock space such that they induce through (12) a black hole of a mass m

6

and angular momentum j. the answer to this question of course depends
on the structure of the hilbert space. we shall study this point in detail in
sec. 4.4.

(viii) relation to 2d induced gravity
finally, note that for l = 0 and xed r, the metric (1) is equal to polyakovs
[13] 2d lightlike metric which yields an sl(2,) algebra. since 3d gravity is
known to induce 2d gravity at the boundary (r xed), the understanding of
the quantum properties of (1) may yield new information about 2d gravity.

1.2 organisation of the article

the goal of this article is to discuss and provide the proofs for the above
properties of the metric (1). we have written (i)-(viii) in a metric formulation
of gravity because our nal target is quantum gravity. however, the explicit
proofs will be given in terms of the chern-simons formulation [1] of three-
dimensional gravity because they are simpler and provide a rich mathematical
structure.

in sec. 2 we give a short introduction to chern-simons gravity and its
phase space. a detailed discussion about boundary degrees of freedom is
included in that section. in sec. 3 the explicit solution to the equations of
motion, with two dierent classes of boundary conditions, is written down
(in terms of the chern-simons elds) and their induced poisson brackets are
displayed. finally, in sec. 4, we go back to the metric formulation and apply
the results to quantum three-dimensional gravity.

2 chern-simons gravity and global degrees

of freedom

in this section we shall rst briey describe the chern-simons formulation
of three-dimensional gravity. then we analyse the issue of global degrees of
freedom associated to the presence of boundaries. we shall also show in this
section (see sec. 2.6) how the boundary conditions solve part of the unitary
problems of three-dimensional gravity.

2.1 chern-simons gravity, its equations of motion and

their solutions

in our approach to the quantum black hole problem, the chern-simons for-
mulation of 2+1 gravity will be of great help. this formulation was discov-
ered in [1] and its quantum properties (for closed manifolds) were explored
in [14]. an extensive treatment can be found in [15]. in a few words, the
chern-simons formulation is a eld redenition that simplies the equations
and introduces a rich mathematical structure.

the basic variables of general relativity in the tetrad formalism are the
triad ea and the spin connection2 a. the equations of motion of three
dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant in these variables
are simply

ra =

ec,

t a = 0.

we dene now two new elds according to,

the 1-form aa is an sl(2, c) yang-mills gauge eld. let f a and f a the cur-
vatures associated to aa and aa. the discovery of achucarro and townsend
[1] is that the equations,

f a = 0,

f a = 0,

(15)

are exactly equivalent to the three-dimensional einstein equations (13). fur-
thermore, the einstein-hilbert action is equal to the combination,

i[a, a] = i[a]  i[ a],

where i[a] is the chern-simons action,

to determine the chern-simons coupling constant, or level, k as a func-
tion of the gravitational constants g and l we need to x the representation
of a and a. we use the anti-hermitian su(2) generators,

a = aaja,

a = aaja.

(19)

note that we use the same js in both cases. this means that a is not
the complex conjugate of a. with these conventions, comparing the chern-
simons action with the einstein-hilbert action one nds

k = 

l
4g

.

(20)

the sign of k depends on the identity g = e where e is the determinant

of the triad. this sign determines the relative orientation of the coordinate
and orthonormal basis. we have chosen here the plus sign which means that
we work with e > 0.

note that the gauge eld a is complex and thus the relevant group is
sl(2, c) which is non-compact. this means that we cannot apply in a
straightforward way the quantization of chern-simons theory described in
[2]. our prescription to dene the quantum theory will be to rst nd the
general solution the classical equations of motion, under prescribed boundary
conditions, and then quantize that space. as we shall see, the boundary
conditions will play a key role in making the quantum theory unitary (see
sec. 2.6).

the convenience of the chern-simons formulation is evident. instead of
working with a second order action in terms of the metric, we work with
two at yang-mills elds. the equations (15) show clearly that 2+1 gravity
does not have any local degrees of freedom. this means that all dynamics is
contained in the holonomies [14] and boundary degrees of freedom [16, 17].

the general solution to the equations (15) can be written in the form,

a = g1dg + g1hg,

(21)

where h is also at (dh + h h = 0) but cannot be written as u1du with
u single valued. similar arguments hold for a. the group element g(x) is

9

a single valued map from the manifold to the group. the space of solutions
(21) is invariant under

a  a = u 1au + u 1du

(22)

where u is another map from the manifold to the group. in principle (see
below for a detailed discussion), we can use this symmetry to set g = 1
in (21) and thus all solutions are classied only by the independent values
of holonomy h. the quantization of this sector of phase space was rst
discussed in [14].
its dimensionality is nite and cannot account for the
large black hole degeneracy. for this reason we shall not consider them here
anymore. however, it is important to stress that the black hole gauge eld
does have non-trivial holonomies. indeed, it can be shown that the gauge
eld corresponding to a black hole satises [18],

p expi a =: exp(w),

p expi a =: exp( w)

(23)

where

tr(w2 + w2) = 322mg,

tr(w2  w2) =

322jg

l

,

(24)

and m and j are the black hole mass and angular momentum, respectively.
only for 8gm = 1 and j = 0 these holonomies are trivial. the corre-
sponding solution is anti-de sitter space (11).

2.2 the strategy

since chern-simons theory does not have any local excitations, all relevant
degrees of freedom are global. we shall consider here the situation on which
the topology is xed and thus all relevant states come from the presence of
boundaries. the existence of boundary degrees of freedom has been analysed
in great detail by carlip [19] using a covariant formalism and path integrals
(see also [17] for an approach similar to ours). here, we shall describe an
equivalent procedure based on the hamiltonian formalism in the form dis-
cussed by regge and teitelboim [20]. this approach can be summarised in
the following steps. given an action i[] with a gauge symmetry g we
need to:

 impose boundary conditions on the elds such that i[]/ exists.
these boundary conditions are not unique and their election represent

10

an important physical input into the theory. [in practice, one rst de-
cides the boundary conditions and then add to the action the necessary
boundary terms to make it dierentiable.]

 find the sub-group of gauge transformations that leave the boundary

conditions and the action invariant.

 find the canonical generators which generate the symmetries of the
action. if a generator is a constraint, we shall call the associated sym-
metry a gauge symmetry. congurations which dier by gauge symme-
tries are identied and represent the same physical state. conversely, if
a generator is dierent from zero (even on-shell), we call the associated
symmetry a global symmetry. note that according to this denition,
global symmetries do not need to be rigid. global symmetries map the
space of physical states into itself.

we shall see that a proper distinction between global and gauge sym-
metries is crucial to understand the boundary degrees of freedom in chern-
simons theories.

2.3 global symmetries and boundary degrees of free-

dom

the appearance of boundary degrees of freedom can be summarized as fol-
lows. chern-simons theory has 3n elds aa
 ( = 0, 1, 2; a = 1, ..., n).
however, the gauge symmetries of the action tells us that they do not rep-
resent independent physical degrees of freedom. in fact, locally, using the
symmetry (22) one can kill all of them (the temporal component aa
0 is a
lagrange multiplier, while the spatial components aa
i are 2n elds subject
to n constraints f a

ij = 0 plus n gauge conditions).

the question we want to address here is whether the symmetry (22)
is really a gauge symmetry, in the sense that two elds related by it are
to be considered the same, or not. after properly dening what a gauge
transformation is, we shall see that at the boundary the transformation (22)
is not a gauge symmetry, although it is still a symmetry of the action. then,
two solutions of the form (21) with g and g such that, at the boundary, g 6= g
represent two dierent physical congurations. this boundary eect can give
rise to an innite number of degrees of freedom (independent solutions to
the equations of motion). at this point we can make contact with carlips

11

would-be-gauge degrees of freedom approach: the eld g, at the boundary,
is dynamical and its dynamics is governed by a w zw action[19].

in the presence of boundaries the denition of a gauge symmetry becomes
delicate because not all the transformations encoded in (22) are generated
by constraints.
indeed, if u does not approach the identity map at the
boundary, then the associated canonical generator is a non-zero quantity
and hence that transformation is not a gauge symmetry. see sec. 2.5 for a
proof of this statement in chern-simons theory.

following diracs quantization procedure (see [21] for an extensive treat-
ment), we dene a gauge transformation as a symmetry generated by a (rst
class) constraint. on the contrary, a symmetry of the action generated by
a non-zero quantity is called global, even if it is not rigid. by denition,
the space of physical states, or phase space, is the set of elds which sat-
isfy the equations of motion, modulo gauge transformations. let us ignore
the holonomies for a moment. the general solution (21) then reduces to
a = g1dg. if no boundaries are present, this space of solutions is trivial
containing only one element a = 0 because the transformations (22) are gen-
erated by constraints (hence, they represent gauge symmetries) and one can
use (22) to set g = 1 and thus a = 0.

on the contrary, if there is a boundary, part of the symmetry (22) is not
generated by a constraint (to be proved below). therefore, while it is still
true that we can transform any at a to 0 using (22), it is not true that
the state a and the state 0 represent the same physical conguration. both
states, a 6= 0 and a = 0 (at the boundary), are solutions to the equations
of motion and they are related by a symmetry of the action. however, they
are physically distinguishable. indeed, there is a gauge invariant conserved
charge which takes dierent values in each state. our main problem is then to
determine the set of elds a which solve the equations of motion and cannot
be set to zero by the action of a constraint. as we shall see, in chern-simons
theory there is an innite number of them.

in a quantum mechanical notation, the above discussion can be summa-
rized as follows. denote by g0 the set of transformations which are true
gauge symmetries generated by constraints, and by q those which are not.
physical states satisfy g0| >= 0. on the other hand, q generates a sym-
metry of the space of physical states, that is q| >= | >. we shall prove
explicitly (at least in chern-simons theory; for a general discussion see [22])

12

that g0 and q satisfy an algebra of the form,

[g0, g0] = g0,
[g0, q] = g0,
[q, q] = q + c

(25)
(26)
(27)

where c represents (schematically) a possible central term. eq. (25) is the
denition of rst class constraints. eq. (26) means that if | > is physical
(g0| >= 0) then q| > is also physical (q generates a global symmetry of
the hilbert space). finally, eq. (27) is the algebra of the globally symmetry.
the appearance of central terms in (27) cannot be discarded by a general
principle [22]. note however that since q does not generate a gauge sym-
metry and it is dierent from zero, the central term does not represent any
trouble after quantization. an interesting and important example on which
the central term is present was discovered in [5].

the above discussion is a quick summary of the results presented in
[20, 23, 22, 5], and many other papers that have followed this work. the
nice property of chern-simons theory is that these ideas can be tested with
minimum calculations. another system which is simple to analyse is yang-
mills theory on which the above analysis leads to the denition of global
colour charges[24]. however, in that case, the resulting global algebra is
nite dimensional and does not have any central terms.

2.4 boundary conditions in chern-simons gravity

2.4.1 making the action dierentiable

the black hole manifold is asymptotically anti-de sitter and then it has a
boundary. in the euclidean sector, the boundary has the topology of a torus
with compact coordinates  and t. it is convenient to dene the complex
coordinates on the torus

w =  + it,

w =   it,

(28)

and then ad + atdt = awdw + a wd w.

boundary conditions are necessary in order to ensure that the action
principle has well dened variations. as discussed above, all the dynamics of
2+1 gravity is contained in the boundary conditions. for this reason, it is a
key problem to choose them judiciously. in particular, if they are too strong

13

there will be no dynamics left in the theory. for the black hole problem
(which is asymptotically anti-de sitter) there is a natural choice of boundary
conditions rst discussed in [9] in the minkowskian signature and extended
to euclidean signature in [25]. in the coordinates (28) they read simply

aa

w = 0,

aa

w = 0

(at the boundary).

(29)

a quick way to convince ourselves that the black hole satises this con-

dition is to consider the constant curvature metric

ds2 = e2(dx2 + dy2) + l2d2.

(30)

a natural election for the triads is {e1 = edx, e2 = edy, e3 = ld}. the
torsion equation dea + a
bcb  ec = 0 yields for the components of a {1 =
(1/l)edy, 2 = (1/l)edx, 3 = 0}. dening w = x + iy it is clear that
aa = a + (i/l)ea and aa = a  (i/l)ea satisfy (29). it can be shown that
the black hole metric (8) which is also of constant curvature satises (29) as
well [25]. see [26] for the explicit transition from (30) to (8).

this example also illustrates the choice of orientation. suppose we choose
a new set of triads given by e1 = edx, e2 = edy and e3 = ld.
these new elds satisfy the torsion equation because is homogeneos in e, and
einstein equations because they are quadratic in e. however, the determinant
of ea
 is negative. as we remarked before, the value of k given in (20) depends
on the orientation of the orthonormal basis, and the identity g = e. we

have chosen e > 0 and then the election ea is not allowed.

let us check that (29) are enough to make the action dierentiable. the
variation of the chern-simons action gives a term proportional to the equa-
tions of motion plus a boundary term,

ics = zm

(eom)aaa +

k

(31)

the boundary term vanishes due to (29). thus, the variation of the action
under the boundary condition (29) is well dened. later we will restrict
further the values of the gauge eld at then boundary, but for the purposes
of this discussion the above boundary conditions are very useful.

14

in summary, we work with the chern-simons action (16) supplemented
with the boundary conditions (29) and no added boundary terms.
[note
that when passing to the hamiltonian formalism there will be a boundary
term[25].] as a further check that this action is appropriated to the black
hole problem, one can prove [27] that its value on the euclidean black hole
solution is nite and gives the right canonical free energy (gibbons-hawking
approximation).

2.4.2 the chiral boundary group

the second step in the regge-teitelboim procedure is to determined how the
gauge symmetries are aected by the boundary conditions, i.e., to determine
the residual group of transformations that preserves (29). this is actually
very simple. we look for the set of parameters a satisfying

aa

w = d wa = 0

(at the boundary).

(32)

since by (29) a w = 0 this condition simply imply that  wa = 0. the
subset of gauge transformations leaving (29) invariant are then those whose
parameters at the boundary are chiral, only depend on w.

let us now check that this group leaves the action invariant. the variation

of the chern-simons action under aa = da gives a boundary term,

ics =

=

= 0

k

4 zm
4 zm

k

aa  da
(aa

wd wa  aa

wdwa)

(33)

which vanishes thanks to (29) and (32). there is an important point to
be stressed here.
it is often said in the literature that the chern-simons
action is invariant under aa = da only if  = 0 at the boundary. this is,
as we have just shown, not true. the right statement is that  cannot be
completely arbitrary at the boundary but it can be dierent from zero. under
the boundary condition (29), the action is invariant under transformations
with non-zero values of a at the boundary provided that parameter is chiral
(a = a(w)). this gives rise to an innite dimensional symmetry.

15

2.5 ane (kac-moody) algebras

let us briey describe the main steps leading to (25-27) in chern-simons
theory. for more details, the reader is referred to [28, 29].

in the 2+1 decomposition of the gauge eld aa = aa

chern-simons action reads,

i[ai, a0] =

(34)

where b is a boundary term. here we have used that tr(jajb) = (1/2)ab.
the coordinates xi are local coordinates on the spatial surface denoted by
. this action has 2n dynamical elds aa
i (a = 1, ..., n; i = 1, 2) and n
lagrange multipliers aa
0. the dynamical elds satisfy the basic equal-time
poisson bracket algebra,

i (x), ab

{aa

j(y)} =

4
k

ijab2(x, y).

the poisson bracket of two functions f (ai) and h(ai) is computed as

{f, h} =

.

(35)

(36)

the functionals f and h need to be dierentiable with respect to ai.

the equation of motion with respect to a0 leads to the constraint equa-

tion,

ga

0 =

k

ijf a

ij  0,

(37)

whose parameters vanish at the boundary. indeed, dene g0() = r aga

which, we expect, will be the canonical generator of the gauge transforma-
i = dia. this is indeed true but only for those transformation
tions aa
0
and compute ai(x) = [aa
i (x), g0()]. it is direct to see that the functional
derivative of g0() with respect to ai is well-dened only if a vanishes at
the boundary. in that case, one does nd [aa
i (x), g0()] = dia and thus
g0() generates the correct gauge transformation. (we stress here that g0()
should not be identied with the constraint: g0() is the constraint smeared
with a parameter that vanishes at the boundary.)

however, as we discussed in sec. 2.4.2, the chern-simons action with
the boundary condition (29) is also invariant under transformations whose

16

parameters at the boundary are chiral a = a(w) but dierent from zero.
what is then the generator of those transformations? consider

q() = z

aga

0 

k

4 z

aaa.

(38)

it is easy to check that the boundary term arising when varying the bulk
part of (38) is cancelled by the boundary term, without imposing any con-
ditions over . the combination (38) then has well dened variations even
if  does not vanish at the boundary. furthermore, one can check that
[aa
i (x), q()] = dia and therefore q indeed generates those transforma-
tions whose parameters do not vanish at the boundary.

the key point here is that q is no longer a combination of the constraints
(for a| 6= 0) and thus it is dierent from zero, even on-shell. according to
the previous discussion, q generates a global symmetry of the action. two
congurations which dier by a transformation generated by it represent
physically dierent states. as a direct application of this result, we nd
that two at connections a and a whose values at the boundary dier,
(a a)| 6= 0, cannot be connected by the action of a constraint. thus, as
we have anticipated, the values of a at the boundary represent the physically
relevant degrees of freedom. the next step is to prove that there exists
solutions to the equations of motion, satisfying the boundary conditions (29),
with dierent values for a at the boundary. this is done in the next section.
by direct application of the poisson bracket (36) one can nd the alge-
bra of two transformations with parameters  and  not vanishing at the
boundary,

[q(), q()] = q([, ]) +

ada

(39)

k

where [, ]a = a
bcbc. this equation should be compared with (27). also,
note that if  vanishes at the boundary then q() = g0(). one can then
easily see that (39) reproduces (25) and (26) as well.

the algebra (39) provides the simplest way to determine the poisson
bracket structure on the space of functions which cannot be set to zero by
the action of a constraint. we shall do this explicitly in next section.

2.6 unitarity. an su (2) eld

to end this section, we mention an important consequence of the boundary
conditions (29). namely, they provide a simple solution to one of the prob-

17

lems with unitarity in chern-simons gravity. as we have mentioned above,
the gauge eld a = a + (i/l)ea is complex and therefore the relevant group
is sl(2, c) which is non-compact. it has been argued in [30], and explicitly
used for example in [31] and [25], that under some conditions in the path
integral one can set ea = 0 and work with the su(2) gauge eld aa = a.
for closed manifolds, this has been shown to give a good prescription [30],
but it is not the case for manifolds with a boundary.

the boundary conditions (29) lead to a simple solution to part of this
problem. indeed, expressing (29) explicitly in terms the triad and spin con-
nection one nds,

a

w +

i
l

e w = 0,

a
w 

i
l

ew = 0.

(40)

using these equations, the non-zero components of a and a at the bound-
ary, namely aw and a w, can be written in terms of the spin connection as,

aa

w = 2a
w,

aa

w = 2a
w.

(41)

this shows that the non-zero components of the gauge eld at the boundary,
which in fact carry all the dynamics, are real su(2) currents.

since all the dynamics of chern-simons theory will be dened at the
boundary, this simple observation means that we can indeed work with two
su(2) currents and forget about the non-compact nature of sl(2, c). of
course in the bulk we still have an sl(2, c) eld and this makes the statement
all the dynamics is contained at the boundary delicate. we shall not
discussed this point anymore in this paper. our prescription will be to treat
the gauge degrees of freedom classically and to quantise the reduced phase
space, after the gauge has been xed. in the language of [3], the chiral w zw
action arises classically (by varying with respect to a0 instead of integrating
over it) and we work with its basic poisson bracket which is the su(2) ane
algebra. actually, we shall not make explicit use of [3], but rederive the same
algebras by studying global symmetries of the chern-simons action. some
comments on the relation between both methods will be given in sec. 3.3.

for later convenience, we mention here that using (40) the formulae (41)

can also be rewritten in terms of the triad as

aa

w =

2i
l

ea
w,

aa
w = 

2i
l

ea
w.

(42)

these formulae are more useful when constructing the metric out of the
connection via g = ea

eb

ab.

18

note nally that the equations (40) make a link between the i appearing
in a = w + (i/l)e and the i appearing in the complex structure given to the
torus through w =  +  t (we are using here  = i).

3 the ane and anti-de sitter solutions

as discussed in detail in the last section, the presence of a boundary means
that not all the values of the eld a are related by proper gauge transfor-
mations. two solutions of the equations of motion a and a whose values
at the boundary dier by a chiral non-zero transformation are physically
distinguishable solutions.

this means that the space of solutions is not trivial. in this section we
shall explicitly solve the equations of motion with the boundary conditions
(29) and isolate the variables which are physically relevant. we shall also nd
the induced poisson bracket acting on the space of dynamical (gauge-xed
residual functions) degrees of freedom.

3.1 the ane solution
we work on the solid torus with coordinates {w, w, } and a = awdw +
a wd w + ad. our goal in this section is to nd the general solution to the
equations of motion which satises the boundary condition (29).

the rst step is to x the gauge and eliminate the redundant degrees of

freedom. we impose the gauge condition,

a = ij3,

(43)

which implies that  is a proper radial coordinate (see below). our conven-
tions for the matrices ja are given in (18). note that the i present in (43)
means that e 6= 0. this is necessary because otherwise the triad would be
degenerate. next we impose the boundary condition a w = 0 [see (29)]. the
equations of motion f = 0 in the coordinates {w, w, } read explicitly,

aw  wa + [a, aw] = 0,
a w   wa + [a, a w] = 0,
wa w   waw + [aw, a w] = 0.

(44)

19

the general solution to these equations in the gauge (43) and satisfying
a w = 0 at m is,

aw = b1 a(w)b,
a w = 0,
a = b1b

where a is a chiral function, a = a(w), but otherwise arbitrary and

b = eij3 =   e/2

0

0

e/2 ! .

(45)

(46)

since a(w) is arbitrary, the space of solutions (45) is innite dimensional.
the question is whether dierent solutions with dierent values for a are
related by gauge transformations or not. consider a conguration of the
form (45) and act on it with the transformation,

a = d,

 = b1 (w)b.

(47)

it is direct to see that the eect of this transformation on the solution is to
produce another solution of the form (45) with a = a + dw  (here dw 
denotes covariant derivative in a, dw  = w  + [ a, ]). thus, by acting
on (45) with (47) we move around on the space of solutions. actually, the
transformations (47) are the most general set of transformations that leave
the boundary condition and gauge xing conditions invariant.

since the parameter  appearing in (47) does not vanish at the boundary,
the canonical generator of (47) is a non-zero quantity of the form (38). we
then conclude that dierent values of the function a are connected by global
transformations generated by (38) and not by the action of constraints. the
function a then represents dynamical degrees of freedom. even more, since
(45) is the most general solution to the equations of motion with the boundary
condition (29), the function a generates the full space of non-trivial solutions
with those boundary conditions.

as it was pointed out in [25], this analysis is also valid if the boundary
is located at a nite value of the radial coordinate. this observation is
important, for example, if one expects to nd a conformal eld theory at
the black hole horizon. the main dierence between the metric and chern-
simons approaches to global symmetries is that in the former one works with
dieomorphisms while in the latter with gauge transformations. contrary to

20

gauge transformations, dieomorphisms are not local and move the position
of the boundary. for example, the residual dieomorphisms associated to
anti-de sitter space [5] have a non-zero radial component.

our next step is to determine the poisson bracket structure acting on
the space of solutions, that is, the induced poisson bracket acting on the
functions a. this is very easy thanks to a general theorem proved in [22].
first, we note that after the gauge is xed (the constraint is solved and (43)
is imposed) the value of q given in (38) reduces to the boundary term,

q() = 

k

4 z a aa,

(48)

which is, as we have emphasized, dierent from zero. the theorem [22] states
that after the gauge is xed and one works with the induced poisson bracket
(or dirac bracket), the charge q satises the same algebra (39) as it did the
full charge q,

[ q(), q()] = q([, ]) +

k

4 z

this algebra can be put in a more explicit form by dening,

(49)

(50)

(51)

the algebra (51) is called kac-moody or ane algebra and represents an in-
nite dimensional symmetry of the space of solutions. the quantum version is
obtained simply by replacing the dirac bracket by i times the commutator,

[t a

m] = iab

(52)

this equation represents the algebra of the gauge-xed basic variables (anal-
ogous to [q, p] = i) of chern-simons theory with the boundary condition (29).
there are various ways to see this explicitly, which also provide alternative
derivations of (52). conceptually, the most direct derivation of this result
is by starting with the three-dimensional poisson bracket (35). then we x
the gauge as in (43) and solve the constraint f = 0. the solutions to the

21

constraint equation in this gauge are parametrized by the function a. one
can then compute the dirac bracket of a with itself and nd the ane alge-
bra (52). other methods yielding the same result are the w zw approach
followed in [3], and the symplectic method [32]. the idea of looking at rst
class quantities and their algebra in chern-simons theory was rst discussed
in [28]. the presence of central terms in the algebra of global charges in
chern-simons theory was rst discussed in [33].

note that in our applications to general relativity, the value of k is neg-
ative (see eq. (20)). this can be cured simply by replacing3 t a
n  t a
n, or
in other words, by replacing the maximum weight condition t a
n|0 >= 0 by
t a
n|0 >= 0 (n > 0). in any case, we shall not consider (52) as the starting
point for quantization but rather a restriction of it which yields the virasoro
algebra with central charge c = 6k. for this reason, in this particular cal-
culation, it seems convenient to work with a negative k. incidentally, note
that the virasoro algebra is also invariant under ln  ln, c  c.
solution to the equations of motion.

because of its ane symmetry we shall call the solution (45) the ane

3.2 the anti-de sitter solution

in principle we could consider the algebra (52) as our denition for the gauge-
xed basic quantum commutator. as we have pointed out in sec. 2.6, the
gauge eld a is a real su(2) current and therefore the modes t a
n satisfy the
hermitian condition (t a
n. we shall explore the quantum properties
of this general metric elsewhere. our goal here is to describe the space of
solutions to general relativity with anti-de sitter boundary conditions. the
metric which follows from the general ane solution does not satisfy this
requirement and thus we need to impose further restrictions on it [9].

in the conventions displayed in (18), the solution (45) for aw can be

written as,

aw =

a  a3 ! b

(53)

with a = a1  i a2 and b is dened in (46). we remind that the other
components of the solution are a w = 0 and a = ij3, and similar expressions
hold for the anti-holomorphic eld.

3we thank m. asorey and f. falceto for useful conversation on this point.

22

the extra boundary conditions follow from looking at the form of the

gauge eld associated to euclidean anti-de sitter space which satises

a3 = 0.

a+ = 2,

(54)
the anti-holomorphic eld satises a = 2, a3 = 0. these conditions were
rst discussed in [34], and their relation to anti-de sitter spaces was realised
in [9]. in the w zw approach, they can be incorporated in the action by
adding lagrange multipliers. this leads to a gauged w zw action whose
conformal generators follow from the gko coset construction.

we shall impose (54) as part of the boundary data. since (45) solves the
equations of motion for arbitrary values of a+, a and a3, the gauge eld
will still be a solution after imposing (54). this means that among the three
components of the gauge eld aa only one component, a, remains as an
arbitrary function. it is convenient to rename this function as,

l(w) = 

k
2

a(w)

and thus the solution we are interested in has the form,

aw(l) = ib1 

0

(1/k)l(w) 0 ! b,

1

(55)

(56)

where l(w) is an arbitrary function of w, and b is given in (46). as we shall
see, this solution is appropriated to anti-de sitter spacetimes.

the boundary group leaving (54) invariant is no longer the kac-moody
algebra (52) because that algebra does not preserve (54). let us nd the
group of transformations leaving (54) invariant. first, we look for those
gauge transformations a = d which preserve the form (56) changing only
the values of l. these transformations are generated by parameters of the
form [34],

 = b1 

(i/2)

(1/k)l + (1/2)2 (i/2) ! b



(57)

where  = (w) is an arbitrary function of w, and b is given in (46). acting
with (57) on aw we nd,

with

aw(l) + dw = aw(l + l),

l = i(l + 2l +

k
2

3).

23

(58)

(59)

this shows that l is a quasi-primary eld of dimension two under the residual
group of transformations leaving (56) invariant.

the next step is to determine the algebra associated to these transfor-
mations. this can be done by imposing the reduction conditions (54) in
the algebra (52) and computing the induced algebra. geometrically speak-
ing, given a poisson bracket structure of the form [xa, xb] = j ab(xa) (j ab
invertible) one denes the symplectic form ab as the inverse of j ab. the
antisymmetry and jacobi identity satised by j ab imply that ab is a closed
2-form. now, let (xa) = 0 a set of constraints on phase space such that
c := [, ] is invertible. the surface dened by (xa) = 0 will be
called . let  the pull-back of  into . it follows that the induced pois-
son bracket structure on  is simply the inverse of  (the invertibility of 
is guaranteed by the invertibility of c). see, for example, [21] (chapter 2)
for more details on this construction and in particular its relation with the
dirac bracket.

in terms of the modes t a

n dened in (50), conditions (54) read
n = k0

we then need to consider the matrix (evaluated on the surface (60)),

by an straightforward application of the method explained above, the

can be written in terms of the original bracket [ , ] as (sum over n  z is

this bracket, by denition, satises [a, t 3
n ] for any function a,
on the surface (60). now we compute the algebra of the remaining component
t 
n . as before, it is convenient to dene ln = t 
n . the lns are then the
fourier modes of the function l dened in (55),

n ] = 0 = [a, t +

l(w) = xnz

and satisfy the virasoro algebra,

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m 

k
2

n3n+m

with a central charge

c = 6k.

(66)

(67)

(68)

note that since k is negative (see (20)), the central charge in (67) is positive
and thus highest weight unitary representations exist.

the form of the central term in (67) is not the standard one. one could
shift l0 in order to nd the usual n(n2  1) term. however, for the black
hole whose exact isometries are so(2)  so(2) (due to the identications)
it is more natural to leave the central term as in (67). this is also natural
from the point of view of supergravity since the vacuum black hole killing
spinors are periodic [6].

the space of solutions (56) is invariant under conformal transformations
generated by l(w). note that in the chern-simons formulation of three-
dimensional gravity the chern-simons coupling k was related to newtons
constant g as k = l/4g (see (20)). this means that the central charge in
the virasoro algebra c = 6k coincides with the brown-henneaux [5] central
charge c = 3l/2g. this is not a coincidence [9]. as we shall see, the above
conformal algebra represents exactly the brown-henneaux conformal sym-
metry of three-dimensional ads gravity. the relation between the reduction
conditions (54) and the conformal symmetry found in [5] was stablished in
[9]. a previous calculation of the central charge using the chern-simons for-
mulation of three-dimensional gravity and a twisted sugawara construction
was presented in [29].

what we have done for the holomorphic sector can be repeated for the
n =

and the central charge is c = 6k. note that the eective coupling in
the anti-holomorphic chern-simons theory is k because the chern-simons
action i[ a] has a minus sign in front. however, the non-zero current is now
a w instead of aw. the change k  k is compensated by w  w and we
nd the same virasoro algebra with the same central charge in both cases.
we shall call the gauge elds (56) and (69) the anti-de sitter solution
of the equations of motion because they are appropriated to anti-de sitter
spacetimes.

3.3 the w zw and liouville actions

we have displayed in this section two solutions to the chern-simons equa-
tions of motion with an ane (sec. 3.1) and virasoro (sec. 3.2) symmetries.
we have also argued that, at least classically, the corresponding algebras can
be interpreted as basic poisson brackets acting on the corresponding phase
spaces. a natural and powerful way to justify this point is by studying the
induced theories at the boundary for the corresponding boundary conditions.
it is known [3] that under the boundary condition (29), the chern-simons ac-
tion reduces to a w zw action at the boundary whose basic poisson bracket,
rst calculated in [35], is the ane algebra (52). reducing the ane solu-
tion via (54) then gives (67). at this point, a natural question to ask is
what is the boundary action (analogue to the w zw action) which would
give rise directly to the virasoro algebra (67) as its basic poisson bracket.
we do not know the answer to this question. however, an alternative route
can be taken. it was shown in [9] that the two chiral w zw actions arising
in chern-simons gravity can be combined into a single non-chiral action
via g = g1
1 g2. furthermore, the reduction conditions (54) applied to the

26

non-chiral theory lead to a liouville action [36] which has the expected con-
formal symmetry with a central charge equal to c = 6k. the solutions of
three-dimensional gravity can be classied in terms of the solutions of li-
ouville theory. one nds that the dierent monodromy conditions (elliptic,
parabolic and hyperbolic) led to the three classes of solutions: conical sin-
gularities, extreme, and black holes[37]. see [8] for a direct relation between
the liouville energy momentum tensor and the anti-de sitter boundary con-
ditions, without using the chern-simons formalism. the liouville eld has
also appeared in [38] in the study of solutions to the 2+1 classical equations
with a positive cosmological constant.

the liouville action is certainly a good candidate to describe the dy-
namics of 2+1 gravity with anti-de sitter boundary conditions. however,
it should be kept in mind that its derivation from the w zw model is not
unique and a better control on some global issues is necessary. first, merg-
ing the two chiral w zw actions into a single one through g = g1
1 g2 is not
unique because g is invariant under g1  ag1, g2  ag2 with a arbitrary.
second, the liouville action arises in terms of a gauss decomposition of the
group element which is not global. for these reasons we have not commit-
ted ourselves to any particular form for the boundary action but instead
we have treated the basic poisson bracket algebras as the starting point for
quantization.

4 a quantum spacetime

we have found in the last section a general solution for the classical equa-
tions of motion with prescribed boundary conditions. we have also found
the induced poisson bracket structure acting on the gauge-xed dynamical
functions. our aim in this section is to quantise those spaces and apply the
results to three-dimensional gravity.

however, an important warning is necessary here. the space of solutions
that we have displayed (ane and anti-de sitter solutions) are explicitly not
coordinate invariant. this means that we could have chosen other coordi-
nates to describe that space and it is not guaranteed that the correspond-
ing quantum versions would be equivalent. for example, we know that a
full quantization of the chern-simons action with compact groups induces a
shift in the coupling constant [2, 3, 4] which is not seen in our gauge-xed
approach (although it is suggested by the sugawara form of the conformal

27

generators; see [29] for a construction of the virasoro generators using a
twisted sugawara operator). we shall not attack this problem here in the
belief that at least in the large k limit our results can be trusted.

it is worth stressing here that the fact that we have found non-abelian
poisson structures (virasoro and kac-moody algebras) is a consequence of
the self-interacting character of gravity. the non-abelian pieces in those
algebras are measured by the coupling k which in the semiclassical limit,
when gravity becomes linearized, goes to innity.

4.1 the metric

the general solution to einstein equations in three dimensions with anti-
de sitter boundary conditions can be found using the results of last section
, ab
together with the correspondence between metrics g and connections aa

discovered in [1]. given the connections aa
, one constructs the lorentz
vector ea
ab. it follows
from the analysis of [1] that if aa
 satisfy the chern-simons equations
of motion, then g satises the three-dimensional gravitational equations.

) and then the metric g = ea

 and aa

 = (l/2i)(aa

  aa

for our calculations it will be useful to dene the matrix,

e =

l
2i

(a  a)

where a = aaja and a = aaja. the spacetime metric is then given by

g = 2tr(ee).

(71)

(72)

the conventions for the ja matrices are displayed in (18).

the ane solution (45) (and its anti-holomorphic part) is certainly a very
general and interesting solution for the chern-simons equations of motion,
however, the induced metric does not satisfy the anti-de sitter boundary
conditions prescribed in [5]. this is the reason that we have also considered
the reduction of (45) via (54) which leaves an asymptotically anti-de sitter
spacetime, with a conformal symmetry.

consider the anti-de sitter solutions (56) and (69) for the chern-simons
equations of motion and let us compute the associated metric. using (71)
we compute the components of the triad,

ew =

e w =

and then using (72) we nd the metric,

ds2 = 4gl(ldw2 + ld w2) +(cid:16)l2e2 + 16g2l le2(cid:17) dwd w + l2d2.

(74)

(75)

(76)

here we have used the value of k given in (20). this is the metric that was
displayed in sec. 1.1. we can now go through the properties listed in that
section and check their validity.

first, by construction (76) solves the einstein equations because the cor-
responding gauge elds solve the chern-simons equations. this, of course,
can be proved explicitly by checking that (76) has constant curvature. since
l(w) and l( w) are arbitrary functions, the metric (76) provides an innite
number of solutions to einstein equations with a negative cosmological con-
stant in three dimensions. these solutions represent dierent physical states
because two metrics with dierent values of l, l are related by a global dif-
feomorphism (global dieomorphism here is what was called improper in
[23]). at this point it is necessary to prove that the notion of global dieo-
morphism has an analogue within general relativity. since (76) has constant
curvature, there exists a change of coordinates mapping (76) into the anti-de
sitter metric (11). the question is whether that change of coordinates is
generated by one of the constraints of general relativity or not.

in complete analogy with the gauge case, we dene global dieomor-
phisms as coordinate transformations which are not generated by the con-
straints of general relativity[20]. rather, global dieomorphisms are gener-
ated by non-zero quantities which enter as boundary terms in their canonical
generators. this has been analysed in detail in [5] from where we conclude
that two metrics of the form (76), which only dier of the values of l and
l, are connected by a global dieomorphism. the functions l and l then
represent physical degrees of freedom from the gravitational point of view.

4.2 dieomorphisms in chern-simons gravity

it is interesting and instructive to prove explicitly that there exists a change of
coordinates {w, w, }  {w, w, } which preserve the form of (76) changing
only the values of l and l. this is the goal of this paragraph. to nd these

29

transformations we can either do it by brute force acting with lie derivatives
on (76), or by using the results of the last sections making a dictionary
between gauge transformations and dieomorphisms. we shall follow this
last procedure.

it is well known that, due to the atness of the gauge eld, in chern-
simons theory the dieomorphism invariance is not an independent symme-
indeed, a dieomorphism along a vector eld  can be written as a
try.
 [14]. the converse is, in
gauge transformation with a parameter a = aa
general, not true. however, in the case of chern-simons gravity where the
relevant group is sl(2, c) and an invertible triad exists, one can prove that
all gauge transformations act on the metric via dieomorphisms.

, ab

more explicitly, let g the metric associated to a particular conguration
aa
 through (71) and (72). now, consider an arbitrary gauge transforma-
tion with parameters a, a acting on aa, aa. it follows that the transformed
metric (associated to the transformed elds) is related to the original one by
a dieomorphism generated by a vector eld 

to prove this statement, and nd the explicit formula for 

(,), consider
the action of the gauge group on the triad. from (71) we nd that under a
 the triad changes according
gauge transformation a = d,  a = d
to,

(,).

e =

l

 (  ) 
d(w)

[e,  + ].

(77)

here we have used that a + a = 2 where  = a
ja is the spin connec-
tion, and d(w)
 denotes its associated covariant derivative. the second term
in (77) is a lorentz rotation of the triad which does not change the metric.
we then concentrate on the rst term. let us dene the so(3) vector a
and its associated vector eld 

() by,

a =

l
(a  a),
2i
aa.
 = e

(78)

(79)

we assume that ea
how does the transformation,

 is invertible then (79) does make sense. we now study

ea

 = d(w)

 a = d(w)

 (ea

),

(80)

change the metric. dene the christoel symbols in the standard way by

30

ea


 ea

 = 

4. the transformation (80) becomes ea

d(w)
; where the
semicolon denotes standard covariant derivative. the action of this transfor-
mation on the metric is,

 = ea



g = ea
= (ea
= ; + ;,

ea + ea


ea,
;)ea + ea

(ea

;),

(81)

where in the last line we have used the denition of the metric tensor and
the identity g; = 0. thus, a transformation in the triad of the form (80) is
indeed seen in the metric as a dieomorphism. since the gauge transforma-
tions acting on a, a produce (up to a lorentz rotation) a transformation of
the form (80) with a given in (78), we conclude that the gauge group acts
on the metric via a dieomorphism with a parameter dened in (79).

now we apply this result to the particular case of the residual gauge
transformations (57) and (70). the residual vector eld 
(,) associated to
those transformations is computed directly from (57) and (70) plus (78) and
(79). the formulae for the triad are given in (73)-(75).
it should be clear from the above analysis that 

, generates a residual
symmetry of the metric (76). this can be summarised in the following ta-
ble. a(l) and aa
( l) represent the residual connections (56) and (69), and
g(l, l) the associated metric (76). under the residual gauge transforma-
tions (57) and (70) the gauge eld and metric transform according to:

a(l)
a( l) 

a(l) + a
a( l) +  a

=
=

a(l + l)
a( l +  l)





g(l, l)  g(l, l) + l(,)g = g(l + l, l +  l)



where l is given in (59), and the same expression holds for  l. the equal-
ities in the rst two lines simply express the fact that the residual gauge
transformations leave the gauge eld invariant changing only the values of l
and l. the third line contains non-trivial information. first, as we discussed

4the meaning of this denition can be uncovered by writing it in the form 
beb

 =
e
aa
 , under the
change of basis from the coordinate basis  to the orthonormal frame ~va described by
the matrix ea

,. this is the transformation law of a connection, a

b  

 + e

aea

:  = ea

~va.

31

above, the metric associated to the transformed gauge elds is related to the
original metric via a dieomorphism parametrised with the residual vector
eld 
(,). then, since the transformed metric can also be written in terms of
a(l + l), a( l +  l), we nd the last equality and conclude that the vector
eld 
(,) generates a residual dieomorphism of the metric (76). this anal-
ysis exhibit the power of the chern-simons formalism. to discover that the
metric (76) has a residual conformal invariance not only asymptotically
using lie derivatives would have been extremely complicated.

let us work out explicitly the case on which l = 0. the metric (76)

reduces to the simple form

ds2 = 4gll(w)dw2 + l2e2dwd w + l2d2.

(82)

we act on this metric with the holomorphic residual transformation gener-
ated by (57). the associated residual vector  = x is computed from (57)
and the triad (73)-(75) with l = 0. in the coordinates {w, w, } it reads,

 = 

i
2

,

w = i,

 w = 

i
2

e22.

(83)

transforming the metric (82) with this vector one nds the same metric with
l replaced by l = l + l, and

l = i(l + 2l 

l
8g

3).

(84)

since l/8g = c/12 = k/2 with c and k given respectively in (3) and (20),
we nd consistency with (59), as expected. as a further check, we can now
transform (82) with the anti-holomorphic residual transformation generated
by (70). since l is a quasi-primary eld, we expect that this transformation
will not preserve l = 0 and thus the metric (82) will be transformed into
(76) with l =  l. indeed, from (70) and (73)-(75) we nd the associated
transformation,

 = 

 ,

i
2

w = 

i
2

e2 2 ,

 w = i +

2igl

l

e4 2 .

(85)

we act on (82) with this vector and nd a metric of the form (76) with
l = (il/8g) 3 . this is exactly the right transformation, in accordance
with (84) applied to the anti-holomorphic eld l( w).

32

as a last example of the conformal residual symmetries of (76) we mention
here the case of the nite (holomorphic) exponential map. to simplify the
notation we set here 4g = 1 and l = 1. let us make the nite change of
coordinates on (82) {w, w, }  {z, w, } dened by
e2

w = w + (i/2)e2,

z = eiw,

= ie2+iw

(86)

this transformation maps the cylinder w into the plane z, but leaves w in
the cylinder. note that here we are using explicitly the independence of w
and w. we act on the metric (82) with this change of coordinates and nd
again the same metric with l(w) replaced by t (z) = z2(l(w) + 1/2). the
shift 1/2 = 6/12, of course, corresponds to the schwarztian derivative of the
map (86). (in the conventions 4g = 1 and l = 1 the central charge (3) is
equal to 6.)

4.3 black holes

as we have mentioned above, the metric (76) reduces to a three-dimensional
black hole [11, 12] when l = l0 and l = l0 are constants. this can be
proved as follows. first, we dene the constants m,j and r by

l0 + l0 = ml =

l0  l0 = j =



+ + r2
r2
8gl
2r+r
8gl

.

next we dene the real coordinates , t and r by,

w =  + it,

and

,

(87)

(88)

(89)

r2 = r2

+ cosh2(  0)  r2
+  r2

 sinh2(  0).
(90)
the constant 0 is given by e20 = (r2
)/(4l2). this radial denition has
the property l2d2 = n 2dr2 where n 2 is the lapse function appearing in
the black hole metric (8). the constants r are the solutions of the equation
n 2(r) = 0. after a long but direct calculation one can prove that the metric
(76), in the coordinates {t, r, }, is exactly equal to the metric (8) with mass
m and angular momentum j.
since we are working in the euclidean sector, the coordinate t appearing
). in order

in (89) and (8) is periodic, 0  t < , with  = 2l2r+/(r2

+  r2

33

to x the period of the time coordinate to be independent of the black hole
parameters (and thus x the complex structure of the torus), one can dene
z =  +  x0 with 0  x0 < 2 and  = i/2. since  and x0 are periodic,
the complex coordinate z is dened on a torus,

z  z + 2n + 2 m,

n, m  z.

(91)

with  its modular parameter. introducing  is particularly convenient when
studying modular invariance on the black hole manifold[25, 39]. we shall not
deal with this issue here, so we use (89).

4.4 the quantum space of metrics. state counting

we have described in the last paragraph a set of metrics parametrized by
two functions whose induced poisson bracket yield the virasoro algebra with
a non-zero central charge. we shall now promote the algebra (67) to be a
quantum algebra and study the properties of the associated quantum metric.
the unitary representations of the virasoro algebra for a given positive
central charge c are parametrized by a single real positive number h.
in
the semiclassical limit with k large, the virasoro central charge c = 6k is
then large. under these conditions, there exists one unitary representation for
each conformal dimension h. we start with the vacuum state |h > satisfying
l0|h >= h|h > and ln|h >= 0 (n > 0). the excited states are constructed
with the negative modes ln acting on |h >. the full representation, for a
given h, is spanned by the vectors |n1, ..., nr; h >:= ln1    lnr|h > with
r = 1, 2, .... the same construction has to be repeated for the other virasoro
algebra ln.

in standard conformal eld theory, the values of h are not arbitrary. they
are equal to the conformal dimensions of the primary elds h of the theory.
the state |h > is created by h via |h >= h(0)|0 > where |0 > is the true
conformal vacuum. in our situation, we do not have a eld theory at the
boundary (of course it could be liouville theory, see sec. 3.3 for a discussion
on this point) but only the virasoro algebra. the usual state-operator map
will then be missing until we decide which is right conformal eld theory.

once we promote the modes ln and lm to be operators acting on fock
space, the metric (76) becomes an operator that we shall denote by ds2.
note that since the metric (76) is an algebraic function in l and l which
does not involve products of non-commuting operators, ds2 is well dened in
the operator sense.

34

we can now dene a natural map from fock space to the space of classical
solutions. for each state | > in fock space, we associate a classical solution
to the equations of motion given by,

ds2

 =< |ds2| >

(92)

 is the metric (76) with l =< | l| > and l =< |l| >.
where ds2
since (76) is a solution for arbitrary values of l and l, the metric (92) is a
solution for any state | >. more interesting, the full set of solutions (76)
can be generated by the above map.
according to (92), every state | > induces a unique classical solution.
the converse is not true. for a given classical solution there may be many
associated states. in particular, there are many states associated to a given
black hole of mass m and angular momentum j. as explained before, the
metric (76) gives rise to a black hole when l and l are constants and related
to m and j by (87) and (88). let |m, j;  > the set of states in the hilbert
space such that they satisfy

< m, j; |(ln + ln)|m, j;  > = lm 0
n,
< m, j; |(ln  ln)|m, j;  > = j 0
n,

(93)

for all  = 1, 2, 3, ..., (m, j). these states generate through (92) a black hole
of mass m and angular momentum j. we can then formulate the problem of
black hole degeneracy as whether the logarithm of the number of these states,
ln (m, j), is equal to the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the corresponding
black hole of mass m and angular momentum j or not. the answer to this
question depends on the structure of the hilbert space.

let us rst work under the assumption that the virasoro algebra is the
basic quantum commutator of the theory. in this case, the counting is very
simple. the states |n1, ..., nr; h >, properly normalized, precisely have the
property,

< n1, ..., nr; h|ln|n1, ..., nr; h >= l00

n with l0 = h +

ni.

(94)

r

xi=1

the number of these states, (l0, l0), is then equal to number of ways that
one can write an integer as a sum of integers. for large values of l0 and l0
this number is approximated by the well-known ramanujan formula,

c(l0, l0) = e2cl0/6+2c l0/6,

(95)

35

with c = 1. unfortunately, this naive counting does not give the right result.
inserting lm = l0 + l0 and j = l0  l0 in (95) gives an entropy equal to
s = c1/2a/4g, where c is the central charge (3) and a = 2r+ is the
perimeter of the horizon. (the relation between the dierent parameters is
given in (87) and (88).) the prefactor c1/2 shows that our naive procedure
is not yet correct because we would expect the degeneracy of states to be
equal to the bekenstein-hawking value.

if we do not regard (67) as the basic algebra but only as representing the
symmetry algebra of some underlying conformal eld theory, then an elegant
and striking way to relate (67) with the correct bekenstein-hawking entropy
is available [7]. suppose that the algebra (67) represents the virasoro algebra
associated to some conformal eld theory with central charge c. suppose also
that this cft is unitary, in the sense that l0, l0 > c/24 (note that we are
using the virasoro generators which vanish for the vacuum black hole), and
that the partition function,

z[ ] = tr e2i l02i l0,

is modular invariant. this means

z[ ] = z[ ],

  =

a + b
c + d

,

(96)

(97)

for any a, b, c, d  z and ad  bc = 1. then, it follows [40] that that number
of states with l0 and l0 xed is again given by (95) but this time with c = c.
the associated entropy is then exactly equal to the bekenstein-hawking value
s = a/4g with a = 2r+ equal to the perimeter of the horizon [7].

as stressed in [10], this result is too beatiful to be wrong. even more,
recently [41, 42], it has been shown that under some boundary conditions
at the horizon, similar results can be applied to higher dimensions. these
are exiting results which bring closer the long standing dream of a statis-
tical mechanical description for the bekenstein-hawking entropy. however,
there remains to nd the conformal eld theory responsible for the degrees
of freedom and, most importantly, to determine whether general relativity is
enough to describe that cft, or other degrees of freedom like string theory
are necessary.

an alternative route to get the right counting was suggested in [43]. for
integer values of the central charge c, there is a natural way to add degrees of
freedom to the theory in such a way that the counting yields the right result.

36

the idea is that the virasoro algebra (67) can be regarded as a sub-algebra
of another virasoro algebra, with central charge 1 and generators qn, via the
formula,

1
c

ln =

qcn.

(98)

see [44] and references therein for a detailed description of this embedding.
(the formula (98) has also appeared in [45].) the number of states associated
to the representations of the operators qn is again given by (95) with c = 1
and l0 replaced by q0. since by (98) q0 = cl0, this yields the right result
when using (87) and (88). the main problem with this approach is that we do
not know how to relate the gravitational degrees of freedom to the generators
qn. perhaps one should look for other boundary conditions, generalising (54),
which may give other conformal structures, generalising (67). this issue is
presently under investigation.

whether the virasoro operators are fundamental variables or not, this
will not change our quantum geometry picture. the microscopical origin
of the black hole degeneracy is associated to dierent states (living in the
correct cft) which generate the same classical metric through (92).

5 final remarks

maldacena [46] has conjectured a duality between large n super-conformal
eld theory in four dimensions and type iib string theory compactied on
ads5  s5. this relation has become known as ads/cft correspondence
due to the relation between the symmetry groups in each theory. the re-
sult of brown and henneaux [5] relating ads3 and a conformal algebra in
1+1 dimensions can also be regarded as an ads/cft correspondence. note
however that contrary to the higher dimensional case, this relation involves
only asymptotic ads space whose isometry group is innite dimensional. in
[37, 47, 48] the relation between these two aspects of the ads/cft corre-
spondence has been explored.

finally, we would like to mention here a surprising motivation to study
three-dimensional gravity. it has been shown in [49] and [50] (see also the
recent review [51]) that there exists duality transformations relating ve-
dimensional black holes with three-dimensional ones. this means that ev-
erything we can learn about three-dimensional quantum gravity can be useful
to higher dimensional situations.
