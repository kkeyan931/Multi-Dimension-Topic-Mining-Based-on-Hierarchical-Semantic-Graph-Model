abstract

the quantum mechanical transition between a free particle la-
grangian and the klein gordon eld description of a free particle (par-
ticle wave duality) is conjectured to extend to an analogous construc-
tion of relativistically invariant wave equations associated with strings
and branes, which we propose to call brane-wave duality. electromag-
netic interactions in the two systems are discussed. it is emphasised
that all integrable free eld theories, including those of dirac-born-
infeld type, are associated with lagrangians equivalent to divergences
on the space of solutions of the equations of motion.

(for a massless eld). this may be cited as an example of particle-wave
duality. to distinguish between lagrangians which involve square roots and
those which do no we use a cursive notation for the former and a capital for
the latter. is there a similar alternative description of strings and branes?
one goal of this article is to suggest that there is a natural extension. the
idea is that corresponding to each direction in the world-volume there should
be associated a eld. for example the strings described by the nambu-goto
string lagrangian

out of the d co-ordinates x of space-time. this higher dimensional analogue
of particle-wave duality we might facetiously describe as brane-wave duality.
similar ideas have been advanced before by hosotani [1][2] and morris [3][4].
what they do is to take the lagrangian for a string in d-dimensions and relate
it to a lagrangian for d 2 elds in d dimensions. this amounts to a change
of variables in their case. they show that the classical equations of motion
are equivalent under interchange of dependent and independent variables.
however, we should like to advocate that since the quantum mechanical
equation which describes a free particle is the klein gordon equation, for
only one eld, independent of the dimension of the embedding space, it would
seem that in the case of n branes the eld theories describing them quantum
mechanically should depend upon only n, rather than d  n elds. we shall
argue however, that it seems more attractive to take a square root as the
correct power, as this, as we shall demonstrate, guarantees covariance of the
equations of motion; the counterpart of the reparametrisation invariance of
the original dirac-born-infeld brane lagrangians.

the two properties found for the nambu-goto lagrangian (l3), namely
that it transforms under reparametisation of the independent variables with
a factor which is the jacobian of the transformation and that l3 vanishes or
is constant on the space of solutions of the equations of motion of the schild
lagrangian (l3)2,[5][6], have recently been shown to persist for lagrangians
of the dirac-born-infeld type [7][8][9] ,

even in the presence of electromagnetic elds [10]. analogues of both these
properties may be deduced for the wave eld lagrangians introduced in this
paper (5). we see the rst of these as being common to all theories de-
scribing free objects, and devote the next section to a catalogue of examples.
these may in certain cases be extended to include supersymmetry. we then
demonstrate how the dieomorphism invariance of the brane lagrangians
translates into covariance of solutions for the wave elds with square root
lagrangians. we then analyse in some detail the case of the point particle
and the string. some special cases of these lagrangians are shown to be
completely integrable in implicit form and nally we make some speculative
remarks concerning the coupling of gauge theories to the wave elds.

lagrangians for free elds

in fact we may note that a generic property of free elds is that their la-
grangians vanish, or are divergences on the space of solutions of the equations
of motion which vanish, with vanishing rst derivatives on the boundary.
this is trivial for l2, the klein gordon lagrangian, which may be rewritten
after partial integration as

l2 = 

1

2 x 

2
x2


.

(7)

likewise the dirac lagrangian, i   m  which is already in null
form, that for the maxwell theory and pure gravity all vanish on the space
of solutions of the equations of motion. it is not true of non abelian gauge
theory, except for the self dual sector, where, by denition

f f  =

1
2

f  f ,

(8)

and the right hand side is a divergence. this principle extends to the wave
lagrangians of born-infeld type in a straightforward manner. here, under

eld redenitions   (, ),   (, ) the lagrangian l4 = l4

scales with a conformal factor which is the jacobian of the transformation.
also the quantity

considered as a lagrangian, reproduces the same equation of motion as does
l4 and is zero on the space of solutions. it thus diers from l4 by a diver-
gence. in a similar fashion

is itself a divergence. similar remarks, mutatis mutandis, can be made about
the same constructions with   . these statements are easy to prove and
simply depend upon the determinantal nature of l4. the key result, which
obtains also in general dimension for (5) is that

(12)

the rst term on the right hand side is a divergence, the second is simply
2l4, as a consequence of the determinantal properties of l4. thus the
left hand side of (12) serves as an equivalent lagrangian, giving the same
equations of motion as the original one. in the case of (10) the corresponding
term left over after extracting the divergence is zero, again as a consequence
of determinantal properties. obviously this argument extends to dual brane
lagrangians of any dimension. this property suggests that these lagrangians
have a pseudo-topological aspect.
if they were equivalent to divergences
without any further constraint, they would be fully topological; but here the
equivalence works only for solutions of the equations of motion.

in general, a typical equation of motion, of which only d 2 are independent
can be written in the following form:

to strings in d dimensions and to branes. the only essential dierence is that
in the typical equation of motion,  is now an arbitrary choice of n + 1 values
and j is now a jacobian of a subset of n of those variables x, with respect
to the n world sheet co-ordinates j.

computer calculations show that for a the nambu-goto lagrangian there
in general, an object (parti-

cle/string/brane) which sweeps out an n-dimensional world volume in d-
dimensional space-time has only d  n independent equations of motion.
the basic reason for this is that in the case d = n the lagrangian is a
divergence, so all the equations of motion vanish.

4 equations of motion of inverse type
for the lagrangians of inverse type, i.e. l2 = l2, l4 = l4 etc. there is
just one equation for l2 and two for l4 and so on, irrespective of the dimen-
sion of the total space; however these equations fall into sums of equations
appropriate to the minimal dimension for a non trivial embedding. what
this means is that for l2 in 2 dimensions, the minimal case the equation is
the well known bateman equation [12]

to be discussed at greater length in section 5, while in 3 dimensions the equa-
tion is the sum of three bateman equations, corresponding to the three ways
of selecting two co-ordinates out of three. a particular class of solutions to
these equations can be found by simultaneously setting these three bateman
equations to zero. it is also noteworthy that these three equations also result
from the transformation of the three equations of the form (13) by exchanging
the roles of dependent and independent variables. much the same happens
for l4. here the minimal dimension is 3. the two equations of motion in d

dimensions fall into the sum of (cid:16)d

5 covariance

this chapter deals with special properties of lagrangian densities of the
previous form, but where the square root has been taken, as in the stan-
dard born-infeld. here the feature of general covariance plays an important
role. this works for arbitrary dimension; under the transformation of the
lagrangian l of square root type under the eld redenition

(19)
l acquires a factor which is the jacobian of the transformation and the
equations of motion are unaected on account of (11) since they are given
by

(20)

as the rst two terms cancel on account of (11). thus the square root of the
determinantal form is a generally covariant lagrangian, which means that
any function of a solution remains a solution of the equations of motion.
in fact the equations of motion arising from these lagrangians, in the case
where the number of co-ordinates x exceeds that of the number n of wave
elds by one are a generalisation of the bateman equation1 and are expected
to be completely integrable, since this is the case for n = 1 and n = 2, as we
shall demonstrate in the next section.

(21)

in the case of 2 dimensions ( = 1, 2). this action is fully integrable as the
equation of motion is just the bateman equation (18)

this equation has the general solution;

f ()x1 + g()x2 = c = constant

(22)

we know that the equations of motion are covariant; therefore we expect
that they are expressible in rst order form in terms of two ratios of the
jacobians

this equation is equivalent to (23). the remarkable feature of this la-
grangian is that any dierentiable function f (u) instead of 1 + u2 will give
the same equations of motion [12]! this generalises; in the second case

lthree = (x2x3  x3x2)q(1 + u2 + v2)

q(1 + u2 + v2) may be replaced by any arbitrary dierentiable function of

two variables, f (u, v) and an equivalent pair of equations of motion is as
follows;

these equations admit an implicit solution for (u, v) given by solving the
equations

u = f (x3 + ux1, x2 + vx1),

v = g(x3 + ux1, x2 + vx1)

(32)

where f, g are two arbitrary functions of two variables. the general so-
lution to the equations of motion is given by setting u = u(, ) and
v = v (, ) where u, v are two further arbitrary functions, and solving
(31) for , . this demonstrates the integrability of the equations of motion.
the generalisation to n elds in n + 1 dimensions will be straightforward.
it is anticipated that there will be an integrable generalisation to n elds
in d dimensions along the lines of the universal field equation [12][13], but
that would take us too far aeld and away from the spirit of the present
investigation.

6 electromagnetic interactions

the subject of electromagnetic interactions in the study of these new la-
grangians is at this stage somewhat speculative. in the original theory, elec-
tromagnetic interactions are implemented by the rather ad-hoc procedure of
adding an antisymmetric piece to the induced metric; gij  gij + fij this
is consistent with the picture of having gauge elds living on the brane, and
presumably conned to it by some meissner type eect. however the natural
way to couple electromagnetic elds to the dual theory is through a coupling
to the conserved currents in the theory. this will ensure gauge invariance.
it is easy to construct such conserved quantities, eg

j ij
 =

l
 i
x

j,

i 6= j

(33)

and in the case i = j, the currents j ii  j jj are also conserved. there is
however an embarasse de richesse here as these currents carry two indices.
thus the natural coupling is to a two index gauge eld aij
 transforming
under so(n), i.e. the contribution

lcurrent = xi,j

aij

 j ij



(34)

represents the part of the lagrangian coupling a non abelian gauge eld to
the elds i. this suggestion, though appealing, is rather unorthodox. it is
however gauge invariant up to a divergence, as in the gauge transformation

aij
  oikakl

 olj + oik 
x

okj

(35)

the rotation matrices may be removed by a linear transformation of the elds
i and the inhomogeneous term converted to an innoccuous divergence. if
one wants instead to mimic the dirac-born-infeld incorporation of electro-
magnetism, the simplest assumption would be to suppose that a depends
upon the co-ordinates x only through their dependence upon j with direc-
tion in a linear combination of the gradients of j. then we may set

a = xj

j
xaj(i).

10

(36)

then a new lagrangian which adds a term to the matrix components anti-
symmetric in (i, j), the antisymmetry being related to that of f takes the
form with lij = i

this manifestly gauge invariant suggestion is in the same spirit as the original

and this interaction, though gauge invariant is more like a pauli term than
one coming from minimal coupling.

7 conclusion

while our answer might require some modication, we believe that we have
posed an interesting and important question; to nd lagrangians for elds
which bear a similar relation to string and brane lagrangians as does the
klein gordon to that of the classical point particle. a common characteristic
of these lagrangians, as indeed of all free theories, is that they are pseudo-
topological, i.e. the lagrangian is equivalent to a divergence on the space
of solutions of the equations of motion.
if the square root form is taken

11

then the new lagrangians are covariant, and the equations of motion are
integrable and coincide in the case that the dimensions of space-time exceeds
the that of the elds by one, with the universal field equations proposed
earlier [12][13]. some ideas for the introduction of gauge elds have been
discussed.
