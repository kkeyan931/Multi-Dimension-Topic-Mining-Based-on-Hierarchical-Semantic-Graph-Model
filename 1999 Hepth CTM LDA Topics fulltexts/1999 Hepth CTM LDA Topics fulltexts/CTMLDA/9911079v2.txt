abstract
we formulate the renormalization procedure using the domain wall regular-
ization which is based on the heat-kernel method. the quantum eects of
both fermions and bosons (gauge elds) are taken into account. the back-
ground eld method is quite naturally introduced. as for the treatment about
the loop-momentum integrals, an interesting contrast between the fermion-
determinant part and others is revealed. these things are explained taking
some examples. the weyl anomalies for the 2d qed and 4d qed are
correctly obtained. it is found that the chiral solution produces (1/2)d/2
 correct values, where d is the space dimension. taking the model of
2d qed, both weyl and chiral anomalies are directly obtained from the
eective action. the mass and wave function renormalization are explicitly
performed in 4d qed. we conrm the multiplicative renormalization (not
additive one), which shows the advantage of no ne-tuning.

1 introduction

in the lattice world, the new era looks to begin [1, 2]. the so-called doubling
problem becomes claried and the chirality of fermions can be controlled
more eciently than before. we may say the new regularization has been
established in lattice. in accordance with this great development , the coun-
terpart in the continuum is progressing [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. the merit of such
approach is rstly that we can clearly understand the essential part of the
new regularization, which is often hidden in the complexity of the discretized
model. secondly we can compare it with the ordinary regularizations used
so far and apply it to various (continuum) eld theories. the continuum
version, at least, should explain the qualitative features of the lattice domain
wall.

in the domain wall approach so far, at least in the continuum approach,
the gauge eld in the fermion determinant is mostly treated as the external
eld. (as for the lattice model analysis, the gauge eld quantum eect was
examined and the renormalizability was checked at 1-loop in [8].) clearly the
situation is not satisfactory in that the gauge eld is not quantumly treated
and that the general perspective about its use in the (perturbative) quantum
eld theory is not presented. indeed the fermion determinant could be the
most important part among other parts, but we must formulate it within
the general setting in order to regard it as a new regularization in the eld
theory. this motivates us to do the present work.

recently a new treatment has appeared in the continuum approach[9, 10].
the main idea is the following. introducing the chirality into a system can
be regarded as a procedure to dene a direction in the system conguration.
usually we introduce it, in the (massless) spinor system, in terms of the
projection operator (1 5)/2. right and left is regarded as such cong-
urations that the system is for or against the xed direction determined by
the eigen values of the operator 5: 5r = +r, 5l = l. here we recall

2

the facts: 1) the heat propagates in a xed direction, that is, from the high
temperature to the low temperture (the second law of the thermodynamics)
and, generally, the heat equation prescribes such behaviour; 2) the famous
procedure to introduce the heat equation into the general quantum system
is the heat-kernel method[11]. the fermion determinant has been so often
examined in this method. (the anomaly is formulated in this standpoint
in [12].) we have shown the above idea works well if we look at the 4 dim
theory from the 1+4 dim space-time.

we summarize this new treatment in sec.2. new results about 2d and
4d qed weyl anomalies are also presented. in sec.3, the renormalization
procedure is introduced and the (renormalized) eective action itself is used
to derive anomalies. at this stage, we still keep the gauge eld external in
order to make explanation simple. in sec.4 we introduce the background eld
method[13, 14] and take into account the quantum eect of the gauge eld
besides the fermion. we do the renormalization of the fermion self energy
explicitly. in sec.5, we present the complete formulation combining the re-
sults of sec.3 and 4. finally we point out that the domain wall regularization
distinctly treats the fermion determinant part from other parts.

 , (+)-domain and (-)-domain respectively.
the key observation is that the heat equations turn out to be the 1+4 dim
minkowski dirac equation after appropriate wick rotations for t. for the
system of 4 dim euclidean qed, d = i( + iea), ( = 1, 2, 3, 4), they

solution based on the another key observation that the system should have a
xed direction. generally the solution of (4) is given by two ingredients[15]:
1) free solution g0(x, y ), and 2) propagator s(x, y ) as the following form.

this gives us the solution g5
m (x, y ) in the perturbative way with respect to
the coupling e. as s(x, y ), we should not take feynman propagator which
has both retarded and advanced components. we should take the retarded
propagator for (+)-domain and the advanced one for (-)-domain. (they are
symmetric with respect to the positive and negative energy parts.)

show the directedness of the solution. in this solution, both the positive

in the backward direction in (-)-domain. we call (6) and (7) symmetric

in this procedure, we naturally notice the existence of the chiral solution

this relation shows the most characteristic point of this 1+4 dimensional
regularization scheme. the condition (ii) comes from the usage of the regu-
larization parameter m in (2), whereas (i) comes from the necessity of con-
trolling the chirality without destroying the system dynamics. note the roles
of the regularization mass parameter m for the t-axis and for the x-axis are
dierent. it restricts the conguration to the ultra-violet region (t  m 1)
in the extra space of t, whereas to the infra-red (surface) region in the real
4 dim space (|k|  |m|). in the concrete calculation, the condition (i) is
taken into account, not by doing k-integral with the cut-o m but by the
analytic continuation in order to avoid breaking the gauge invariance.

the validity of the above regularization was conrmed in ref.[9, 10].
we found the analogous aspects to the lattice domain wall: the domain wall
conguration, the overlap dirac operator, the condition on the regularization
parameter m, e.t.c.. we also conrmed the chiral anomalies (for 2d qed,
4d qed and 2d chiral gauge theory) are correctly reproduced. one of
advantages of the present approach is the equal treatment of the chiral and
weyl anomalies. to see the situation, let us apply the above regularization
to the weyl anomaly calculation. we rst take the simple model, 2d qed,
for the later purpose. it is given, using the chiral solution (13), as[10]

solution gives one fourth of it.

combined with the results for the chiral anomalies in [9, 10], we conclude
that the chiral solution gives (1/2)d/2 (d: space dimension) of the correct

5 the general anomaly calculation based on the ordinary(not using domain wall) heat-

kernel is reviewed in [10].

7

value of the anomaly coecients both for the chiral anomaly and for the
weyl anomaly. the use of the chiral solution reduces the degree of freedom
by half for each double dimensions. this phenomenon looks contrastive with
the lattices doubling species phenomenon.

3 renormalization procedure

in this section and the next one, we develop how to use the domain wall
regularization in the general eld theory. we now introduce the counterterm
action [a] into the eective action [a]   ln z[a]:

bare[a]  [a] + [a]

,

(17)

in such a way that bare becomes nite. how to systematically dene 
and obtain the renormalization properties is the task of this section. let us
take the simple model of 2d qed (schwinger model) for the explanation.
we consider the case  is made of local counterterms. 6 from the power-
counting analysis 7 , we know

[a] = z d2x(cid:16)cdive2a

2 + c

dive a + c

dive a(cid:17)

,

(18)

where cdiv, c
xed. now we take the following renormalization condition on bare[a].

div, is some (divergent) constants to be systematically

the rst equation denes the renormalized coupling, and the second one
guarantees the stability.

in order to regularize t-integral in [a], we introduce here another regu-

larization parameters  and t (0 <  < t < t ,   +0 , t  +):
[a] =  ln z[a] =

let us check above result by calculating the weyl and chiral anomalies
directly from the eective action. (in eqs.(15) and (16) of this paper, and in
ref.[10], anomalies have been obtained from jacobians.) the weyl anomaly
is obtained from the scale transformation of  (or t ).

formation:  = ei(x)5  , /a = /a  1

e6   5. ( a

e , 12 = 1. )

both weyl and chiral anomalies are correctly reproduced. 9 note that the
chiral anomaly derived by the jacobian, in [9], comes from o(a)-part of
g5m
 , whereas that derived here by the eective action comes from o(a2)-
part. (as for the weyl anomaly, the results by both approaches come from
o(a2)-part.)

we conclude this section with listing up all regularization parameters
introduced and compare them with the lattice situation. we have introduced
three parameters m, t, and . they should satisfy the following relations with
two conguration variables: the 4-momentum k and the inverse-temperature
t.

(26)

in the above, we clearly see an important feature of the parameter m. among
three relations above, the latter two are rather familiar ones. (scale is cut-
oed by  in the uv-region, and by t in the ir-region.) the interesting one is
the rst. so far (before the appearance of domain wall regularization) we do
not know such a regularization parameter that depends on the conguration
( specied by k and t in the present case) in this way. in the conclusion
of this paper, we will point out another important character of the present
regularization, which is obtained by the result above and that of the next
section.
in the lattice domain wall case, they introduce four parameters:
m0, a, ls, l[17]. the correpondence with the present case is

present paper

ref.[17]

m  m0, 1+4 dim fermion mass
  a, lattice spacing
t
  ls, the total site number along the extra axis
t  l, physical extent of one direction of the 4 dim box

(27)

9 we notice some contrastive point in the two anomalies. the weyl anomaly does
not depend on the renormalization condition (19), whereas the chiral one depends on
it. the former gives the response to the scale change, hence picks up the divergent part
proportional to ln t /. on the other hand the latter gives the response to the (chiral)
phase change, hence the charge normalization, which is dened by the renormalization
condition (19), is crucial for it.

10

the one extra parameter in the lattice comes from the fact that the extra
space is treated independently from the 4 dim space. it is adopted in the
ordinary domain wall formulation, whereas the present one treats the extra
space as the space of the inverse temperature which appears in expressing
the determinant. in ref.[17], the 4 dim fermion mass mf is also introduced.
in such a case, we also introduce the mass parameter. (see ref.[10])

4 general treatment of renormalization

we have discussed only the fermion determinant for the external gauge eld.
in order for this approach to be regarded as an alternative new regularization
for the general eld theories, the quantum treatment of the gauge elds
should also be described. we devote ourselves on the point in this section.

the present approach quite naturally ts in the background eld method[13,

14]. we explain it taking again 4d euclidean qed as an example. the
quantum eect of both the gauge (photon) eld and the fermion is taken
into account. we consider the massive fermion.

where (i) = (, , a) are the background elds and (i) = (, , a) are
the quantum ones. we notice the term l3 = e  /a is the cubic power of
quantum elds and contribute to the 2-loop and higher-loop orders. terms

11

in l2 are all quadratic power and contribute only to 1-loop. among them the
two terms, e  /a and e  /a, are o-diagonal with respect to the quantum
elds. in order to diagonalize the 1-loop part , we redene the quantum elds:
 =  + ,  =  +  , a
 = a + a. here we choose ,   and a
to be linear with respect to quantum elds in order to keep the loop-order
structure. we require the 1-loop part, l2[, , a], equal to

(x) = z d4y sa(x  y)e /a(y)(y) = z d4y s(x  y)e /a(y)(y) + o(e2) ,
 (x) = z d4y e (y) /a(y) sa(x  y) = z d4y e (y) /a(y) s(x  y) + o(e2) ,(35)

where sa, sa, s, s are dened by

(i6   e /a  m)sa(x  y) = 4(x  y) , (i6   m)s(x  y) = 4(x  y) ,

sa(x  y)(i6   e /a  m)y = 4(x  y) , s(x  y)(i6   m)y = 4(x  y) .(36)
sa(x  y) and sa(x  y) are the background dependent propagators. all
these propagators are (4d) euclidean ones, therefore there is no ambiguity
in the choice of boundary conditions.

the path-integral expression (29) can be rewritten by the redened quan-

tum elds using the measure change:

since we keep the linear relation in the choice of the redened quantum elds,
the jacobian, j, does not depend on quantum elds.

the 1-loop part in the integrand is just the quantity that we have discussed
in sec.2 for the case m = 0 ( sec.7 of [10] treats the case m 6= 0). up to the
lowest nontrivial order, j is obtained as

this corresponds to the 1-loop part for the fermion self energy and the
fermion(electron)-photon vertex. see fig.2. because the jacobian is decou-
pled from the main integral part, the regularization for the divergences in (39)
can be taken independently from the regularization parameter m introduced
in sec.2. the quantity to be regularized in sec.2 was det(6  + ie /a), while
the jacobian above is roughly det(1 + e2 1

both quantities are divergent, but the presence of 2 inside of det-symbol
, in the latter quantity, makes no chiral problem. (there is no ambiguity in
determining the divergent quantity det(2 +  ) because it can be expressed
as the heat equation (not dirac equation ) in 1+4 dim. see sec.2 of ref.[10].
) the (momentum) integral, corresponding to trace in (39), is done by
the usual way appearing in the standard eld theory text book. we explain
the eective-action calculation in the coordinate space a little more.

ln j|e2 = e2z d4yz d4xd(x  y) (y)s(y  x)(x)

where (x) is taylor-expanded around y, and each expanded part is dened
by  , ,  . d(x) comes from the photon propagation and is dened by

5 discussion and conclusion

combining the results in sec.3 and 4, we present the nal form of the renor-
malization prescription (, taking 4d qed as an example,) with the back-
ground eld gauge[14].

(i) = (, , a) : quantum elds

10 in the present continuum approach, this multiplicative renormalization comes from
the fact that the jacobian j decouples from the m -involved part (fermion determinant
part) at (38). in the lattice, the 4d fermion mass is essentially introduced as the cou-
pling m1 between the walls at the two ends of the extra axis. in this case, whether the
renormalized mass is proportional to m1 or not is highly non-trivial, because m could
appear additively simply from the dimensional reason. the numerical simulation supports
the multiplicative renormalization. this fact is very important for no ne-tuning (good
control of the small mass fermion) and for the validity of the chiral perturbation[18].

where the fermion determinant part only is regularized by the domain wall
regularization of sec.2, and other parts by the cutos for the t-axis:  < t <
t (or 1
 ). the background eld gauge is chosen here and  is the
gauge parameter. l is obtained in such a way that bare becomes nite
satisfying some proper renormalization condition on the following quantities.

t < |k| < 1

a(x)a(y) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)= =a=0

especially the fermion mass and the gauge coupling are normalized by the
second and the third condition respectively. renormalization parameters are
obtained by

l[, , a; e, m] + l[, , a] = l[qz2,qz2 ,qz3a; e + e, m + m]

compared with the case in sec.4, we have the relation:

.(46)

qz3 =

(47)

because the background gauge invariance is preserved. some comments, in
relation to the higher-loop structure, are in order[14].

1. generally the terms in the taylor-expansion of l play the role of
subtracting sub-divergences in multi-loop diagrams. its proof is largely
based on the structure of the taylor-expansion.

2. from the viewpoint of the taylor-expansion, compare the treatment of
the gauge part in this section and the previous one(sec.4). in sec.4, the
gauge term,  1
2 (a)2, is faithfully taylor-expanded in (29). there-
fore, in this case, the subdivergence problem is manifestly solved. on
the other hand, the background eld gauge adopted in this section,
lgauge in (44), is not taylor-expanded. the proof of the subdiver-
gence cancellation is solved by using the properties described in the
next item. the superiority of (44) is that the eective action bare is
guaranteed to be gauge invariant.

16

3. in relation to the subdivergence problem mentioned above, at 2-loop
and higher orders, the gauge parameter and quantum elds suer from
the renormalization eect. (renormalization of internal quantities.)

through this analysis, the character of the domain wall regularization is
revealed. first point is the condition on the regularization parameters (26)
as stated in sec.3. the second point is the treatment for the fermion loop
(determinant) is dierent from the other types of loops which are irrelevant
to the chiral problem. the loop momentum for the former has the cuto
as |k|  m whereas that for the latter as |k|  1
 . the two upper cutos
have the relation m  1
 from the requirement (26). it is expected that the
dierent treatment does no harm to the nal physical results as far as the low
energy fermion and gauge bosons are concerned. (this situation is satised
in the lattice numerical simulation.)

in the literature so far, the domain wall is discussed mainly for the de-
terminant calculation for the external gauge eld. in the present paper, we
have formulated it into the general eld theory framework, using the back-
ground eld method, where both fermion and (gauge) boson are quantumly
treated. we can calculate any term, in principle, of the eective action so
far domain wall is discussed mainly for the determinant calculation for the
external gauge eld. in the present paper, we have formulated it into the
general eld theory framework, involving both fermions and gauge elds. we
have explicitly shown the renormalization of the fermion wave function and
of the fermion mass. they agree with the known results.
