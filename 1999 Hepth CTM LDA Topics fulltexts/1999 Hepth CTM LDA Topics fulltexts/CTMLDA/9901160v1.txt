d=10 chiral tensionless super p-branes 1

we consider a model for tensionless (null) super p-branes with n chiral super-
symmetries in ten dimensional at space-time. after establishing the symmetries
of the action, we give the general solution of the classical equations of motion in
a particular gauge.
in the case of a null superstring (p=1) we nd the general
solution in an arbitrary gauge. then, using a harmonic superspace approach, the
initial algebra of rst and second class constraints is converted into an algebra of
lorentz-covariant, bfv-irreducible, rst class constraints only. the corresponding
brst charge is as for a rst rank dynamical system.

1 introduction

the tensionless (null) p-branes correspond to usual p-branes with their ten-
sion tp taken to be zero. this relationship between null p-branes and the tensionful
ones may be regarded as a generalization of the massless-massive particles corre-
spondence. on the other hand, the limit tp  0 corresponds to the energetic scale
e >> mp lank.
in other words, the null p-brane is the high energy limit of the
tensionful one. there exist also an interpretation of the null and free p-branes as
theories, corresponding to dierent vacuum states of a p-brane, interacting with a
scalar eld background [1]. so, one can consider the possibility of tension generation
for null p-branes (see [2] and references therein). another viewpoint on the connec-
tion between null and tensionful p-branes is that the null one may be interpreted as
a free theory opposed to the tensionful interacting theory [3]. all this explains
the interest in considering null p-branes and their supersymmetric extensions.

models for tensionless p-branes with manifest supersymmetry are proposed in
[4]. in [1] a twistor-like action is suggested, for null super-p-branes with n-extended
global supersymmetry in four dimensional space-time. in the recent work [5], the
quantum constraint algebras of the usual and conformal tensionless spinning p-
branes are considered.

in a previous paper [6], we announced for a null super p-brane model, and here we
are going to formulate it, and to consider its classical properties. after establishing

the symmetries of the action, we give the general solution of the classical equations
of motion in a particular gauge. in the case of a null superstring, (p=1), we nd
the general solution in an arbitrary gauge. then, in the framework of a harmonic
superspace approach, the initial algebra of rst and second class constraints is con-
verted into an algebra of lorentz-covariant, bfv-irreducible, rst class constraints
only. the corresponding brst charge is as for a rst rank dynamical system.

2 lagrangian formulation

we dene our model for d = 10 n-extended chiral tensionless super p-branes

by the action:

,

l = v j v k

j 

k,

(1)

j, k = 0, 1, ..., p

,

j, k = 1, ..., p

diag() = (, +, ..., +),
,  = 0, 1, ..., 9.

,

here (x, a) are the superspace coordinates, a are n left majorana-weyl space-
time spinors ( = 1, ..., 16 , n being the number of the supersymmetries) and
 are the 10-dimensional pauli matrices (our spinor conventions are given in the
appendix). actions of this type are rst given in [7] for the case of tensionless
superstring (p = 1, n = 1) and in [8] for the bosonic case (n = 0).

the action (1) has an obvious global poincare invariance. under global innites-
imal supersymmetry transformations, the elds a(), x() and v j () transform
as follows:

a
 = a

,

x = ixa

(aa)

,

v j = 0.

as a consequence 

j = 0 and hence l = s = 0 also.

to prove the invariance of the action under innitesimal dieomorphisms, we rst
write down the corresponding transformation law for the (r,s)-type tensor density
of weight a

t j1...jr

k1...ks[a] = lt j1...jr

k1...ks[a] = llt j1...jr

k1...ks[a]

+ t j1...jr
 t jj2...jr
+ at j1...jr

kk2...ks[a]k1k + ... + t j1...jr
k1...ks [a]j j1  ...  t j1...jr1j
k1...ks[a]ll,

k1...ks

[a]j jr

k1...ks1k[a]ksk

(2)

where l is the lie derivative along the vector eld . using (2), one veries that if
x(), a() are world-volume scalars (a = 0) and v j () is a world-volume (1,0)-
type tensor density of weight a = 1/2, then 
j k is a
(0,2)-type tensor and l is a scalar density of weight a = 1. therefore,

j is a (0,1)-type tensor, 

s = z dp+1j (jl)

2

and this variation vanishes under suitable boundary conditions.

let us now check the kappa-invariance of the action. we dene the -variations

of a(), x() and v j () as follows:

a = i(a) = iv j (6 j a),

(aa),

(3)

x = ixa
v k = 2v kv lxa

(laa).

therefore, a() are left majorana-weyl space-time spinors and world-volume
scalar densities of weight a = 1/2.

from (3) we obtain:

(

j k) = 2ixa

[j a 6 k + ka 6 j ]a

and

l = 2v j 

j k[v k  2v kv lxa

(laa)] = 0.

the algebra of kappa-transformations closes only on the equations of motion,

which can be written in the form:

j (v j v kk) = 0,

v j v k(j a 6 k) = 0,

v j 

j k = 0.

(4)

as usual, an additional local bosonic world-volume symmetry is needed for its clo-
sure. in our case, the lagrangian, and therefore the action, are invariant under the
following transformations of the elds:

a() = v j j a,

x() = ixa

(aa),

v j () = 0.

now, checking the commutator of two kappa-transformations, we nd:

[1, 2]a() = a() + terms  eqs. of motion,
[1, 2]x() = ( +  + )x() + terms  eqs. of motion,
[1, 2]v j () = v j () + terms  eqs. of motion.

here a(), () and () are given by the expressions:

[(kbb

1 )a

a = 2v k xb
 = 4iv k xa

(a

1 6 ka
2 )

2 )a
1 ],

2  (kbb
,

j = v j .

we note that  = (v j 6 j ) in (3) has the following property on the equations

of motion

2 = 0.

3

this means, that the local kappa-invariance of the action indeed eliminates half of
the components of a as is needed.

for transition to hamiltonian picture, it is convenient to rewrite the lagrangian

density (1) in the form ( = /, j = /j ):

l =

1

40h(  jj)x + ixa

a(  jj)ai2

,

(5)

where

v j = (v 0, v j) =  

1
20

,

j

20!

the equations of motion for the lagrange multipliers 0 and j which follow from
(5) give the constraints (p and pa

 are the momenta conjugated to x and a):
tj = pjx +xa

pa
ja.

(6)

t0 = p2

,

the remaining constraints follow from the denition of the momenta pa

:

da
 = ipa

  (6 pa).

(7)

3 hamiltonian formulation

the hamiltonian which corresponds to the lagrangian density (5) is a linear

combination of the constraint (6) and (7):

h0 = z dp[0t0 + jtj +xa

ada
 ]

(8)

it is a generalization of the hamiltonians for the bosonic null p-brane and for the
n-extended green-schwarz superparticle.

the equations of motion which follow from the hamiltonian (8) are:

(  jj)x = 20p xa
(  jj)a = ia,

(aa),

(  jj)p = (jj)p,

(  jj)pa

 = (jj)pa

 + (a 6 p).

(9)

in (9), one can consider 0, j and a as depending only on  = (1, ..., p), but
not on  as a consequence from their equations of motion.

in the gauge when 0, j and a are constants, the general solution of (9) is

x(, ) = x(z) +  [20p(z) xa
= x(z) +  [20p(z) xa
(z) +  (a)p(z),

p(, ) = p(z),
(, ) = pa
pa

(aa(, ))],

(aa(z))]

a(, ) = a(z) + i a,

(10)

4

where x(z), p(z), a(z) and pa

(z) are arbitrary functions of their arguments

zj = j + j.

in the case of null strings (p = 1), one can write explicitly the general solution
of the equations of motion in an arbitrary gauge: 0 = 0(), 1   = (),
a = a(). this solution is given by

x(, ) = g(w)  2
z ds1

w =  +

(s)

the solution (10) at p = 1 diers from (11) by the choice of the particular solutions
of the inhomogenious equations. as for z and w, one can write for example (0, ,
a are now constants)

p(, ) = 1f( + /) = 1f[1( + )] = p(z)

and analogously for the other arbitrary functions in the general solution of the
equations of motion.

let us now consider the properties of the constraints (6), (7). they satisfy the

following (equal  ) poisson bracket algebra

{t0(1), da

{t0(1), t0(2)} = 0,
 (2)} = 0,
{t0(1), tj(2)} = [t0(1) + t0(2)]jp(1  2),
{tj(1), tk(2)} = [l

 (2)} = da
 (1)jp(1  2),
 (2)} = 2iab 6 pp(1  2).

from the condition that the constraints must be maintained in time, i.e. [9]

{t0, h0}  0,

{tj, h0}  0,

{da

 , h0}  0,

(12)

it follows that in the hamiltonian h0 one has to include the constraints

t a
 =6 pda

 are a mixture of rst and second class constraints. t a

 . this is because the hamiltonian has to be rst class quantity, but
 has the following non-zero

 (2)]jp(1  2),

 replaced by t a

in this form, our constraints are rst class and the dirac consistency conditions (12)
(with da
 ) are satised identically. however, one now encounters a
new problem. the constraints t0, tj and t a
 are not bfv-irreducible, i.e. they are
functionally dependent:

(6 pt a)  dat0 = 0.

it is known, that in this case after brst-bfv quantization an innite number of
ghosts for ghosts appear, if one wants to preserve the manifest lorentz invariance.
the way out consists in the introduction of auxiliary variables, so that the mixture of
rst and second class constraints da can be appropriately covariantly decomposed
into rst class constraints and second class ones. to this end, here we will use
the auxiliary harmonic variables introduced in [10] and [11]. these are ua
 and v
 ,
where superscripts a = 1, ..., 8 and  transform under the internal groups so(8)
and so(1, 1) respectively. the just introduced variables are constrained by the
following orthogonality conditions

ua
ub = c ab,

 ua = 0,
u

u+
 u = 1,

where

u
 = v

 

 v
 ,

c ab is the invariant metric tensor in the relevant representation space of so(8) and
(u)2 = 0 as a consequence of the fierz identity for the 10-dimensional -matrices.
we note that ua

 do not depend on .

now we have to ensure that our dynamical system does not depend on arbitrary

the newly introduced constraints (13) obey the following poisson bracket algebra

{i ab, i cd} = c bci ad  c aci bd + c adi bc  c bdi ac,
{i +, i a} = i a,
{i ab, i c} = c bci a  c aci b,
{i +a, i b} = c abi + + i ab.

this algebra is isomorphic to the so(1, 9) algebra: i ab generate so(8) rotations,
i + is the generator of the subgroup so(1, 1) and i a generate the transformations
from the coset so(1, 9)/so(1, 1)  so(8).
lorentz-covariant form. this separation is given by the equalities [12]:

now we are ready to separate da into rst and second class constraints in a

a + (6 p+av)ga
a ],

p+ = pu+

(14)

gaa =

(va+)da.

here daa are rst class constraints and gaa are second class ones:
{daa(1), dbb(2)} = 2iabc abp+t0p(1  2)
{gaa(1), gbb(2)} = iabc abp+p(1  2).

it is convenient to pass from second class constraints gaa to rst class constraints
gaa, without changing the actual degrees of freedom [12], [13] :

gaa  gaa = gaa + (p+)1/2aa



{ gaa(1), gbb(2)} = 0,

where aa() are fermionic ghosts which abelianize our second class constraints as
a consequence of the poisson bracket relation

{aa(1), bb(2)} = iabc abp(1  2).

it turns out, that the constraint algebra is much more simple, if we work not

with daa and gaa but with t a given by

t a = (p+)1/2[(av+)da

a + (6 p+av) ga
a ]

= (p+)1/2da + (6 p+av)a
a .

after the introduction of the auxiliary fermionic variables aa, we have to modify
some of the constraints, to preserve their rst class property. namely tj, i ab and
i a change as follows

the form:

h = z dp[0t0() + j tj() +xa

the constraints entering h are all rst class, irreducible and lorentz- covariant.

up to now, we introduced canonically conjugated ghosts (m ,pm ), (m , p m ) and
momenta m for the lagrange multipliers m in the hamiltonian. they have pois-
son brackets and grassmann parity as follows (m is the grassmann parity of the
corresponding constraint):

{m ,pn} = m
n ,
{m , p n} = (1)m n n
m ,
{m , n} = m

(m ) = (pm ) = m + 1,

(m ) = (m ) = m .

min = mpm ,

where (m ) are scalar parameters and we have separated the m -dependence from

here lgh stands for the ghost part and lgf - for the gauge xing part of the
lagrangian. if one does not intend to pass to the lagrangian formalism, one may
restrict oneself to the minimal sector (min, min, h min
). in particular, this means
that lagrange multipliers are not considered as dynamical variables anymore. with
this particular gauge choice, h min

this does not x the gauge completely.

4 comments and conclusions

to ensure that the harmonics and their conjugate momenta are pure gauge
degrees of freedom, we have to consider as physical observables only such functions
on the phase space which do not carry any so(1, 1)so(8) indices. more precisely,
these functions are dened by the following expansion

in this letter we consider a model for tensionless super p-branes with n global
chiral supersymmetries in 10-dimensional minkowski space-time. we show that the
action is reparametrization and kappa-invariant. after establishing the symmetries
of the action, we give the general solution of the classical equations of motion in a
particular gauge. in the case of null superstrings (p=1) we nd the general solution
in an arbitrary gauge. starting with a hamiltonian which is a linear combination of
rst and mixed (rst and second) class constraints, we succeed to obtain a new one,
which is a linear combination of rst class, bfv-irreducible and lorentz-covariant
constraints only. this is done with the help of the introduced auxiliary harmonic
variables. then we give manifest expressions for the classical brst charge, the
corresponding total constraints and brst-invariant hamiltonian. it turns out, that
in the given formulation our model is a rst rank dynamical system.
