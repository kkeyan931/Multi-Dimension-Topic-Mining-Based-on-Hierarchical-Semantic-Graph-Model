caveat : anomalies renormalisability standard model hinges caveat absence cancellation called anomalies.conceptually,anomalies play vital role rest discussions, worth exam- ine carefully.anomaly eect

classical level,the likelihood way regularising theory maintaining ward identities ruled out.then choice made give invariances. nutshell basis anomalies. analyse anomalies depth,it relevant point invariances need symmetries wignerian sense,which,among things,would associate degeneracies symmetries.therefore,contrary oft-used language,local gauge invariances symmetries hence expression gauge symmetry abuse language.what local gauge invariances represent statements number degrees freedom precisely,they specify physical conguration space theory.a rigid global gauge invariance,on hand,

desirable.from point view con- fronting theory experiments also formulation desirable make hitherto inaccessible aspects theory amenable verica- tion.from matter principle also one insist formulation

constructive one? answering questions instructive take another look anomalies. shall closely follow reasonings nielsen ninomiya,who wanted arrive intuitive understanding anomalies.in particular, clarify mystery classical conser- vation law disappears quantum mechanically?. following let us start weyl-particles 1 + 1 dimensions.the dispersion relations given = p 8 (11) refere respectively

former case,one possible resolution invoke concept dirac sea whereby physi- cally undesirable negative energy states completely lled. pauli exclusion principle would forbid transitions positive energy

chirality unless one invents special type regularisation.we shall see later lattice regularisation special sense.of course, care exer- cised exactly dirac sea regularised otherwise even electric charge perhaps momentum also may conserved. 3.7 constitutes regularisation? essentially regularisation replacing original continuum (but mathe- matically ill-dened) theory one good approximation large
