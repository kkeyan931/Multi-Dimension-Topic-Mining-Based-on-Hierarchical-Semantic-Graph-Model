abstract

we investigate domain-wall/quantum eld theory correspondences in various
dimensions. our general analysis does not only cover the wellstudied cases in
ten and eleven dimensions but also enables us to discuss new cases like a type
i/heterotic 6brane in ten dimensions and domain-wall dualities in lower than ten
dimensions. the examples we discuss include dbranes in six dimensions preserving
8 supersymmetries and extreme black holes in various dimensions. in the latter case
we construct the quantum mechanics hamiltonian and discuss several limits.

introduction

anti-de sitter (ads) gravity has attracted much attention due to the conjectured corre-
spondence to a conformal eld theory (cft) on the boundary of the ads spacetime [1]
(for a review, see [2]). this cft is given by the worldvolume eld theory, in the limit
that gravity is decoupled, of a brane moving in the ads background. in order for this
correspondence to hold, it is essential to have an ads space, whose isometry group acts
as the conformal group on the boundary [3, 4]. the regular pbranes (i.e. the d3brane
in d = 10 dimensions and the m2/m5branes in d = 11 dimensions) exhibit indeed an
ads spacetime in the so-called near-horizon limit. however, for the other branes both
the string as well as the einstein metric do not lead to a similar anti-de sitter geometry.

on the other hand, for all supersymmetric pbranes there does exist a special frame in
which the pbrane geometry, in the near-horizon limit, factorizes into a sphere times an
ads or at spacetime [5, 6]. moreover, the near-horizon geometry of these branes contains
a non-trivial dilaton. choosing a particular radial coordinate, the dilaton eld is in fact
linear in that radial coordinate of ads spacetime. the metric of this special frame is
conformally equivalent to the string frame metric and coincides with the so-called sigma-
model metric coupling to a dual brane probe. it is therefore called the dual frame metric
[5]. ads spaces can be viewed as special cases (in the sense of having a zero dilaton) of
ads spaces with a linear dilaton. ads spaces with a linear dilaton are in fact conformally
equivalent to domain-wall (dw) spacetimes [7]. the presence of the dilaton breaks the
scale invariance and the ads isometry group gets reduced to the poincare isometry group
of the dw.

since all branes are related by duality, it is natural to conjecture that the ads/cft dual-
ities based on the regular pbranes can be generalized to so-called domain-wall dualities,
corresponding to all the other pbranes, where the cft is replaced by an ordinary qft.
indeed, for the dpbranes (p = 0,   , 6) in d = 10 dimensions such dw/qft dualities
have been discussed in [8, 9]. due to the holographic property of an ads space or of a
at spacetime with linear dilaton [10], the dual frame is the natural basis for a discussion
of this dw/qft correspondence [9]. we note that the qft is not conformally or scale
invariant. there will be a non-trivial renormalization group ow and only at xed points
(in the uv and/or ir) can we expect a restoration of the conformal symmetry. examples
of such xed points are the limits where dpbranes decompactify to mbranes [8, 11].

the purpose of this paper is to extend the discussion of the dw/qft correspondence,
given in [8, 9] for dpbranes in ten dimensions, to general two-block pbranes in various
dimensions. all the pbranes we consider have a near-horizon geometry of the form dw
 s (domain-wall times sphere). the pbranes in d < 10 dimensions can be viewed
as pbranes in d = 10 (or intersections of such branes with the harmonics identied)
reduced over some compact manifold k. from the d = 10 point of view these pbranes
have a near-horizon geometry of the form dw  s  k. more general near-horizon
geometries of the form dw  s  s  e (domain-wall times sphere times sphere times
euclidean space) can be obtained by considering intersections where the harmonics of the

2

participating branes have not been identied. such intersections and their near-horizon
geometries have been studied in the second reference of [6] and in [12].

we will start our analysis with a general discussion applicable to any pbrane with a
non-zero dilaton. we discuss the so-called eld theory limit, i.e. the low-energy limit in
which gravity decouples from the worldvolume qft. this limit is dened such that the
qft contains at least one xed coupling constant. our analysis shows that, in order
to obtain a well-behaved dw/qft correspondence, we need to restrict ourselves to a
subclass of pbranes. our choice of restriction is motivated by the condition that the so-
called holographic energy (or supergravity probe) scale u is related to the string energy
(or dbrane probe) scale u via xed quantities only. the exact relation can be found in
equation (63). this condition leads to two constraints, whose precise form can be found
in (64). these constraints tell us to which pbranes we should restrict ourselves and
which coupling constant in the worldvolume eld theory, i.e. corresponding to scalars or
vectors, etc., should be kept xed. we nd that these constraints are sucient to obtain
well-behaved dw/qft dualities. the restricted class of pbranes is distinguished by the
fact that their eective tension is proportional to the inverse string coupling constant.
in fact, the ones in d < 10 can be interpreted as intersections of dbranes in d = 10
which are reduced over relative transverse directions only. the branes participating in
these intersections are equal in number and delocalized in the compact relative transverse
directions.

we will discuss in more detail various special cases in ten as well as in lower dimensions.
these special cases include a type i/heterotic 6brane in ten dimensions, the d8brane,
the so-called dbranes in six dimensions and the extreme black holes in various dimen-
sions. in this paper we will not discuss the details of the worldvolume theory, all that we
need is the worldvolume eld content. an exception is made for the extreme black holes
where we will present the (generalized conformal) quantum mechanics hamiltonian and
discuss several limits.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 1 we summarize the relationship between dw
and ads spacetimes. in section 2 we calculate the near-horizon geometries of a generic
pbrane. in subsection 2.1 we show that for all p the near-horizon geometries factorize
into a dw times sphere geometry using the dual frame metric. in the next subsection
we consider the reduction over the spherical part of the near-horizon geometry and relate
the dw times sphere near-horizon geometry to a dw spacetime after reduction. in a
third subsection we discuss the special cases in which the dw part of the near-horizon
geometry becomes conformally at or pure ads (with zero dilaton).
in section 3 we
discuss the eld theory limit for the general case. the formulae we give in this section
are applied to the special cases we discuss in the remaining sections. first, in section
4 we discuss the ten-dimensional dpbranes, including the d8brane, and the so-called
six-dimensional dpbranes preserving 8 supersymmetries. next, in section 5 we discuss
the quantum mechanics of 0branes, or extreme black holes, in various dimensions and in
section 6 we investigate the special case of a type i/heterotic 6brane in ten dimensions.
section 6 is a bit special in the sense that it can be read independently of the rest of

3

the paper. in section 7 we give our conclusions. we have included 3 appendices.
in
appendix a we give our pbrane charge conventions; in appendix b we elaborate on the
dual frame metric and show that it is identical to the sigma-model metric provided that
one uses the sigma model of the dual brane. finally, appendix c contains a a glossary of
most of the symbols used in this paper together with a short description and the equation
where the symbol is rst used.

1 domain-walls and anti-de sitter spacetimes

before we discuss in the next section the near-horizon geometries of a general pbrane,
we will rst discuss in this section the geometries of domain-wall (dw) and anti-de sitter
(ads) spacetimes. it is known that ads spaces are special cases of domain-wall spaces
characterised by the absence of a nontrivial dilaton background [7]. we will show this
explicitly in this section.

domain-wall spaces solve the equations of motion obtained by varying a (super)gravity
action with a cosmological constant  and a dilaton5. they correspond to pbranes with
worldvolume dimension d = p + 1 which is one less than the dimension d of the target
spacetime they live in. the part of the supergravity action needed to describe the dw
solution is given by (we use the einstein frame):

4
d  1
where b is an arbitrary dilaton coupling parameter.

d+1 =z dd+1x ghr

()2 + ebi ,

(1)

performing a poincare dualization, which replaces the cosmological constant  by a (d+1)-
form eld strength fd+1, allows us to discuss naturally objects of codimension one coupling
to a d-form potential, dening a domain-wall. in terms of the eld strength fd+1 the action
is given by:

se

d+1 =z dd+1x ghr

the equations of motion following from the action (2) can be solved using the general
pbrane ansatz involving harmonic functions. the solutions are (in the einstein frame)6

(d1)dw dx2

d + h 4d

(d1)dw 2(+1)dy2 ,

5we use conventions in which our metric is mostly plus and the string coupling constant gs is dened
as gs = e(). the used conventions imply that when  > 0 we have an ads vacuum and when  < 0
we have a de sitter vacuum (neglecting the dilaton).

6in this section we take gs = 1. later, when we discuss the eld theory limit in section 3, we will put

gs back into the dilaton background expression.

f01...d1 y = 01...d1 yh  ,

with  an arbitrary parameter and the parameter dw dened by

dw =

(d  1)b2

8



2d
d  1

.

this dw is a useful parameter since it is invariant under reductions or oxidations (in
the einstein frame) [13]7.

the function h is harmonic on the 1-dimensional transverse space with coordinate y:

(3)

(4)

(5)

h = c + q|y| ,

with c, q constant. here it is understood that the domain-wall is positioned at the
discontinuity y = 0, and for y < 0 we are allowed to use a dierent value of q. the value
of q can be expressed in terms of a mass parameter m in the following way,

where m is related to the cosmological constant through the equation

q = m ,

 = 2m2
dw

.

(6)

(7)

we see that using the ansatz (3) allows for an undetermined parameter  in the domain-
wall solution. note that the charge q can not be considered a physical parameter because
of its dependence on . the origin of this parameter is the fact that there are coordinate
transformations, labeled by , that keep the solution within the same ansatz. the explicit
form of these coordinate transformations is given in [14].

dierent choices of  lead to dierent expressions for the metric. for instance, one can
always choose  such that the metric is conformally at:

 = dw
dw + 2

.

(8)

this choice was made in [15] for the domain-wall in d + 1 = 10 dimensions. another
possibility is to choose a dbrane basis in which the two powers of the harmonic functions
occurring in the string frame metric are opposite:

 =

dw (d  1)

b(d  1) + dw (d  1) + 2(d + 1)

.

(9)

7 our denition of dw diers from the denition in e.g.

[13] (except when d = 10). the reason
for this is the fact we use dierent normalizations (except when d = 10) for the dilaton. for instance,
in [13] there is in any dimension a 1
2 in front of the dilaton kinetic term (using the einstein frame). this
diers from our normalization of the dilaton kinetic term, as can be seen from eq. (1).

5

this choice was made in [16] for d + 1 = 10 dimensions.

to adapt the discussion to what we will encounter in the next section when we discuss
the near-horizon geometries, we shift the position of the domain wall to innity, allowing
us to discard the constant c in the harmonic function. furthermore, we get rid of the free
parameter  by making the following y   coordinate transformation:

qy = eq .

(10)

the domain-wall solution in the new  coordinate reads

ds2

e = e

m(cid:18) (d1)b2

4dw (cid:19)(cid:18)e2m(

2+dw

dw

)dx2

d + d2(cid:19) ,

e = e

(d1)bm
4dw .

(11)

this solution corresponds to the action (1) with  given by (7).

written like this, it is clear that we can perform a conformal transformation to get rid
of the conformal factor in front of the metric. we thus obtain the regular dual frame
metric gd

with

d = e2m(

2+dw

)dx2

d + d2

,

e = e

(d1)bm
4dw .

gd = ebge ,

(12)

(13)

note that when dw = 2 the metric becomes conformally at.
in the dual frame (12) the domain-wall metric (13) describes an adsd+1 space. in fact
this metric has constant negative curvature, which however is not xed by the cosmo-
logical constant. the deviation is parameterized by the free dilaton coupling parameter
b corresponding to a non-vanishing dilaton charge. furthermore, as discussed in [5], the
linear dilaton corresponds to a non-vanishing conformal killing vector, which means that
conformal transformations have to be accompanied by a shift in the dilaton, i.e. yield a
running coupling constant.

2 near-horizon geometries of pbranes

in this section we discuss the near-horizon geometry of a generic pbrane. in subsec-
tion 2.1 we calculate the near-horizon geometry in terms of the dual frame metric. in
subsection 2.2 we discuss the reduction over the spherical part of the near-horizon met-
ric. finally, in subsection 2.3 we discuss as special cases the conformally at and ads
near-horizon geometries.

(14)

which contains three independent parameters: the target spacetime dimension d, the
dilaton coupling parameter a and a parameter p specifying the rank d  p 2 of the eld
strength f . we have furthermore introduced two useful dependent parameters d and d
which are dened by

dimension of the worldvolume ,

d = p + 1
d = d  d  2 dimension of the dual brane worldvolume .

(15)




we next consider the following class of diagonal two-block pbrane solutions (using the
einstein frame)8:

(17)

which is, in contrast to the dilaton coupling parameter a, invariant under reductions and
oxidations (in the einstein frame). the function h is harmonic over the d + 2 transverse
coordinates and, assuming that

(i.e. no constant or logarithmic harmonic) this harmonic function is given by

(18)

(19)

d 6= 2, 0 ,

h = 1 +(cid:16)r0
r (cid:17)

where r0 is an arbitrary integration constant with the dimensions of length, which is of
course related to the the charge (and mass) of the pbrane (see appendix a).

8we work with magnetic potentials.
9we always have  > 0 except for domain-walls ( d = 1) when  can be negative. note that 
is invariant under toroidal reduction but not under sphere reduction. in subsection 2.2 we will perform
such sphere reductions and obtain domain-walls with dw < 0 out of branes with  > 0.

the two-block solutions (16) include the (supersymmetric) domain-wall spaces of the
previous section. they correspond to the case d = 1,  = 1 and r0 = 1/m. the
solutions also include the known branes in ten and eleven dimensions as well as branes
in lower dimensions. in table 1 we give the values of a and  of a few cases, including
the well-known cases of the m2brane, the m5brane, the dpbranes (p = 0, 1, . . . 6, 8, 9),
the fundamental string, or ns1brane, the solitonic 5brane, or ns5brane, as well as
the dbranes in six dimensions and the (supersymmetric) dilatonic black holes in four
dimensions. for these cases the parameters a and  are given by:

if the branes under consideration preserve any supersymmetries we can set [13]

(20)

where generically 32/2n is the number of unbroken supersymmetries. in case of intersect-
ing branes embedded in a theory with 32 supersymmetries n is the number of branes that
participate in the intersection10

the two-block solutions (16) do not involve waves and kaluzaklein monopoles. we also
excluded dinstantons, whose near-horizon geometry has been discussed in [17, 18]. the

10sometimes branes can be added without breaking more supersymmetries, in which case the above
rule about the number of unbroken supersymmetries and the number of intersecting branes involved does
not hold.

8

case d = 0 that is excluded by (18) corresponds to branes with 2 transverse directions,
e.g. the d7brane in d = 10. the other case d = 2, excluded by (18), corresponds to
spacetimelling branes. such branes are given by a at minkowski spacetime solution
and have no near-horizon geometries.

we next consider the limit for which the constant part in the harmonic function is negli-
gible, i.e. for the limits

r

r0   for d = 1 ,
r
r0  0

all other cases .

(21)

assuming that the branes are positioned at r = 0 this limit brings us close to the brane
when d > 0. when d = 1 however this limit takes us far away from the brane. we refer
to this limit as the near-horizon limit.

in this limit the metric and dilaton becomes

(23)

in this dual frame the spherical part factors o in the near-horizon limit like in [9].

after the transition of the einstein metric to the regular dual frame metric in the action
(14) all terms in the action are multiplied by the same dilaton factor:

we see that the spacetime factorizes into a spherical part and a linear dilaton part.

to make contact with other results (e.g. [1, 9]) it is useful to write the dual frame solution

(31)

the horospherical coordinate u can be interpreted as the energy scale describing super-
gravity probes [11]. in the metric (29) the point u = 0 is a non-singular killing horizon11
and u =  corresponds to the boundary of adsd+1.
using the horospherical coordinate u we recognize the metric as that of an ads space times
a sphere. through (30) we see that r is the size of the ads part relative to the sphere. as
expected we recover in the cases of d3, m2 and m5 the well known relations between the
radius of the sphere and the radius of ads, being respectively r = 1, r = 1
2 and r = 2.
the dimensionful length scale rr0 is the radius of the hyperboloid surface embedded in a
p + 2 dimensional at spacetime with so(2, p) isometry, giving the (induced) metric (29).

summarizing, in this subsection we showed that in the dual frame, dened by (23), all p
branes have a near horizon geometry that factorizes into a domain-wall spacetime dwd+1
times a sphere s d+1. note that the domain-wall part of the metric has all the isometries
of an ads space. these isometries are broken in the complete background because of a
nontrivial linear dilaton.

2.2 reduction over the sphere

sphere reductions of supergravities that admit domain-wall  sphere vacuum solutions
(as opposed to ads  sphere vacuum solutions) have only been recently discussed in the
literature [9, 19]. we expect that when we reduce over the d + 1 angular variables of
11 strictly speaking, the near-horizon (21) does not always correspond to the limit u  0. an exception
is the d = 10 d6brane in which case we have  < 0 and hence the limit (21) implies the limit u  .

the sphere we will end up with a gauged supergravity in d + 1 dimensions whose action
contains the terms

sr

d+1 =z dd+1x gehr + ()2 + i .

(32)

the number of supersymmetries of this action is determined by the original pbrane.
the value of  can be determined from the d + 1-form curvature which, in the magnetic
picture, is just the volume form on the sphere and there is a contribution from the ricci
scalar. we will give the value of  after we determined the domain-wall solution in the
einstein frame. transforming to the einstein frame12

12this transformation to the einstein frame cannot be performed for p = 0.

11

the reduction of the ricci scalar is responsible for the rst term in this expression and the
second term is from the reduction of the (magnetic) ( d + 1)-form curvature. analysing
this expression we nd that all pbrane near-horizon geometries give a  > 0 (with
1  d  (d  3)) except for the domain-walls, which have d = 1 and a sign change
occurs, giving  < 0. we note that this is not in contradiction with the fact that all
pbranes (including the domain-walls) have ads geometries in the near-horizon limit
(as dened in section 2), because the linear dilaton will also contribute to an eective
cosmological constant which is always positive.
notice that the right hand side of (37) only depends on d. this expresses the fact that
when we perform a double dimensional reduction (under which d is invariant), the near-
horizon geometries of the p- and (p  1)brane are also related by a double dimensional
reduction. in contrast, dw is not invariant under a direct dimensional reduction ( d 
d 1): the near-horizon domain-wall solution is mapped to another near-horizon domain-
wall solution with d replaced by d  1.
for the convenience of the reader we give three tables in which the value of dw belonging
to dierent pbranes are given.

2.3 special cases

in this subsection we discuss two special cases where the domain-wall dwd+1 in the near-
horizon geometry becomes a (conformally) at space rd,1 or where the dilaton vanishes
and the spacetime becomes an anti-de sitter spacetime adsd+1.

conformally at spaces
we require that the near-horizon geometry is a at space rd,1 in the dual frame. from
(26) we see that the condition for at space is given by:

2 d =  ,

which, using (31), can also be expressed as  = 0.

this implies that

dw = 2

,

b2 =

and thus the domain-wall solution dwd+1 becomes

2 = e

with a2 = 42

we now look to solutions of condition (40). we restrict ourselves to supersymmetric
solutions enabling us to replace  by 4/n. for n = 1 this condition yields

p = d  5 ,

(43)

which leads to 5branes in 10 dimensions and all double dimensional reductions of the
5brane to lower dimensions. for the next case, n = 2, the condition (40) yields

p = d  4 ,

(44)

which leads to 6branes in 10 dimensions and all double dimensional reductions of this 6
brane in lower dimensions. notice that 32/2n is the number of unbroken supersymmetries
and therefore this must be a type i or a heterotic 6brane. such branes are charged
under yang-mills gauge eld, which is broken to an abelian u(1) gauge eld. for the
heterotic case the solution in the string frame metric gs is given by (a = 1/2)

ds2

h = dx2

d + h 2dx2

e2 = h ,

and the type i solution reads (a = 1/2)

ds2

i = h1/2dx2

d + h 3/2dx2

d+2

,

e2 = h .

(45)

(46)

in both cases the solution for the magnetic gauge eld coincides with the solution for the
type ii 6brane gauge eld. note, that the non-spherical part in both cases is not at,
but conformally at near the horizon. we will discuss the type i/heterotic 6brane in
more detail in section 6.

anti-de sitter spaces

the anti-de sitter case dwd+1 = adsd+1 corresponds to the special case that a = b = 0.
this condition yields (see (17))

(48)

(49)

2d d

it also implies that

dw = 2

and

the solution for these cases becomes (the overall conformal factor vanishes)

dse

 = 0 .

the condition (47) can be satised for the cases that we preserve some amount of super-
symmetry (i.e. using (20)). we nd all the well known cases as we have summarized in
table 5 below [4, 6, 20].

table 5: the table indicates the values of , dw and  (in the einstein frame) for all branes
that have an ads near-horizon geometry.

the table shows that there are branes with an ads geometry for n = 1, . . . 4 and that
these branes have only three dierent values for : 1
2, 1 and 2. note that the mbranes
have the same values for  as the mbranes. in fact, it turns out that the m1brane is

14

an intersection of 3 m5branes and that the m0brane an intersection of 3 m2branes.
a similar thing happens for the d1 and the d3; they both have  = 1 and the d1 is an
intersection of 2 d3branes.

note that the case p = 0 is special: for p = 0 the value of dw blows up and using (7)
we see that the cosmological constant vanishes. however, the corresponding ads2 space
still satises the einstein equation in 2 dimensions and has a nonzero curvature.

3 the eld theory limit

in this section we rst give a general discussion of the eld theory limit of pbranes (sub-
section 3.1). for the convenience of the reader we discuss in the following two subsections,
as a familiar example, the pure ads cases (subsection 3.2) and the conformally at cases
(subsection 3.3). in section 4 and 5 we will discuss examples, some of which are known
but others have not been studied before .

3.1 the general case

the fact that every pbrane near-horizon metric factorizes into a domain-wall times a
sphere suggests that we can relate supergravities on such a background to eld theories
on the boundary in the (generalized) way described in [8, 9]. the conformally at case
requires a special treatment. this case will be separately discussed in subsection 3.3.

when discussing the eld theory limit, one usually starts by writing the harmonic function
in terms of appropriately dened eld theory (energy and coupling) parameters, which
are kept xed, and then shows that taking the limit   0 (low energy limit) the
harmonic function tends to innity, meaning we end up in the near-horizon region. this
near-horizon metric is then shown to stay nite in  units when taking the low energy
limit.

because we want to discuss pbrane backgrounds in general, we do not want to start by
dening appropriate eld theory variables (because in general this will change for every p
brane). instead we will proceed in the opposite direction. starting from the near-horizon
geometry, we perform the r  u coordinate transformation given in (30). in terms of the
the new holographic coordinate u the near-horizon metric is ads for all pbranes and
it is nite in  units. afterwards we perform a consistency check and show that the low
energy limit indeed takes us into the near-horizon region.
until now we assumed gs  1 for simplicity, but for the present discussion we must re
insert the explicit gs dependence into the expression for the dilaton. in other words we
multiply our present expression for the dilaton background with an extra factor gs such
that e() = gs. now that we have an explicit gs in our dilaton background we have
to reanalyse the conformal transformation that takes us to the dual frame. we observe
that when going to the dual frame via a conformal transformation we will be left with

15

an overall power of gs in the dual frame metric (23). to avoid this we must redene the
conformal transformation with appropriate powers of gs (see the equation below). to
obtain a factor of  in front of the metric (29) instead of r2
0 we must make a further
(with l
dened by (134), see the appendix), we redene the conformal transformation to the dual
frame in the following way

l(cid:1)2
modication of the conformal transformation. using the fact that  = (cid:0) r0

gd = l2(cid:18)e

ge.

(50)

the redenition (50) of the conformal transformation will introduce explicit13 gs and l
dependence in the dual frame action. these dependences are determined as follows. as the
low energy limit of string theory, the string frame solutions have no explicit dependencies
on gs. in the action the gravitational + dilaton sector scales as the usual 1/g2
s (hidden
in the dilaton). this should not change when we go to the einstein frame. if we choose
the metric in the einstein frame to not carry explicit gs dependence (as we do in this
paper), the gravitational part of the action should scale explicitly with 1/g2
s (there is no
dilaton to hide it in). the same holds for the kinetic antisymmetric tensor part in the
action. the (implicit) scaling with gs can be read o by looking at the dilaton coupling
in the string frame. this will then determine the (explicit) scaling with gs of the kinetic
antisymmetric tensor part in the einstein frame. the result is the following action in the
einstein frame

(53)
this shows that the ads metric stays constant in  units when taking the low energy
limit if we keep the parameter u xed. it is clear that this analysis does not hold for the
conformally at cases ( = 0). we will discuss this case separately in subsection 3.3.

we want the eld theory on the brane to be nontrivial and decoupled from the bulk
supergravity in the limit   0 (low energy limit). nontrivial means that at least one
13with explicit we mean gs dependence not hidden in e.

16

coupling constant in the eld theory should stay xed when taking this limit. because
generically these coupling constants will be dimensionful (depending on ), xing this
coupling constant will be nontrivial. based on dimensional analysis and the scaling of the
eective tension with gs (see appendix b) we can deduce that the pbrane worldvolume
eld theory has a (t hooft) coupling constant g2

f which can be written as follows:

here n denotes the number of stacked branes and the scaling of the coupling constant
with gs is as the inverse tension p1, involving a constant k equal to

.

(55)

the undetermined numerical factor cp and the parameter x depend on the specic eld
theory under consideration. depending on whether x is positive or negative, the factor in
(54) involving n and gs should either become large or small in the low energy limit in order
to keep g2
f xed. decoupling of the bulk supergravity is ensured when the d-dimensional
newton constant vanishes:

gd =

(2ls)(d2)

322

g2
s  0 .

(56)

when using the t hooft coupling constant gf as a xed parameter, like we do, we can
always keep gs small (when x > 0 we can tune n   to x g2
f instead of taking gs  )
and thus in the low energy limit gd  0 and (ddimensional) gravity decouples. if we do
not use the freedom to tune n, the analysis becomes more subtle because the bulk theory
can become strongly coupled (gs  ). sometimes this implies that the decoupling
of gravity must be analyzed in d + 1 dimensions and in some cases this decoupling is
impossible [21]. this is for instance the case for all domain-wall pbranes and the d6
brane in d = 10.

in general a pbrane worldvolume eld theory will involve dierent multiplets and thus
dierent coupling constants. these coupling constants only dier in their dependence on
. fixing one of these coupling constants will ensure that the other coupling constants
become either small or large in the low energy limit. when a coupling constant becomes
small that sector of the pbrane eld theory will decouple. for a large coupling con-
stant it will depend on the pbrane eld theory under consideration what will happen.
when considering yang-mills theories with 8 supercharges, the theory will involve vector-
and hyper-multiplets. the vacuum structure of the theory is described by two dierent
branches, the higgs branch where the scalars in the hypermultiplet have expectation val-
ues and a coulomb branch where the scalars in the vector multiplet have expectation
values. when we consider all the branes on top of each other, as we will do, the ex-
pectation values of the vector multiplet scalars (describing the relative positions of the
stacked branes) are zero. this means the theory can only be in the higgs branch (with
non-zero hyper multiplet scalars) where all the vectors become massive (except for the
u(1) center of mass multiplet describing the motion of all the branes in the transverse

(58)

space). the masses of the vectors will be proportional to the vector multiplet coupling
constant and will therefore decouple if we take that coupling constant to innity. we will
be left with a theory consisting of scalars only. note that we do not specify the vacuum
structure of the eld theory precisely. this is related to the fact that, when we consider
an interpretation in terms of intersecting branes, the participating branes are delocalized
in the compact relative transverse directions. the above sketched scenario applies when
we discuss dpbranes in d = 6 (subsection 4.2) and has been discussed extensively in the
case of pure ads3 [1] and in relation with matrix models of m-theory on t 5 [22, 23].
to summarize, when we speak of the eld theory limit we take 14

  0,

u = xed,

g2
f = xed.

(57)

furthermore, from the start we assume that gs  1. this is necessary in order to make
sure that the supergravity approximation is valid. as a consistency check, we must show
now that the above limit takes us into the near-horizon metric. for this purpose we
rewrite the harmonic function in terms of the xed quantities u and g2
f , leaving a power
of :

since we must have h   in the eld theory limit, it is obvious that the exponents of 
and gs should not both be positive. we will see in the next sections that in all interesting
supersymmetric examples ( 6= 0) we have
x  d


< 0 .

(59)

in some cases the power of gs is positive, 2(k1)
> 0 which could spoil the limiting
behaviour of the harmonic function h. however, we can always tune gs in such a way
that we end up in the near horizon limit when we take the eld theory limit. at the
end of this section we will discuss a restriction on the parameters x and k which will be
sucient to always satisfy the condition (59).
putting all the  dependence of the dilaton background inside the xed quantity g2
can write the dilaton background as

(60)

we can trust the background solution when the dilaton is small. for a positive sign of
the overall exponent of gs in (60), the dilaton is small everywhere except near the point
u = 0 or u = , depending on the sign of a( + 1)/. when the dilaton becomes large
14 instead of   0 and u = xed one can also say that at an energy scale u one takes the limit
u  0.

18

we should consider the s-dual brane. a detailed analysis of where the dilaton is large can
not be given in this general setup. note that in general the dilaton background explicitly
depends on gs. it turns out that this explicit dependence aects in a negative way the
eld theory - supergravity dualities we would like to nd. we will come back to this point
at the end of this subsection after we have made some restrictions on the parameters k
and x.

to trust the supergravity solution requires that the curvatures in the string frame remain
small. another way of putting this is demanding that the eective string tension (in the
dual frame) times the characteristic spacetime length is large. from the metric (53) we
see that the characteristic spacetime length in the dual frame is of order 1 (the length
scales describing the radii of the ads space and the sphere are of order 1 in  units).
calculating the eective string tension in the dual frame using (50) we deduce that the
supergravity approximation will be valid provided

d =(cid:0)dpne(2k)(cid:1)2/ d

 1 .

(61)

finally, the perturbative eld theory description is valid provided the eective dimen-
sionless coupling constant g2
f , is
small:

e, constructed from the holographic energy scale u and g2

e = g2
g2

f ux  1 .

(62)

depending on the sign of x the perturbative eld theory description will either be valid
near u = 0 or u = . note that using the holographic energy scale u to construct
the eective dimensionless coupling constant means that we use supergravity probes [11].
also notice that this dimensionless combination of g2
f and u is the one appearing in the
dilaton expression (60).

summarising, to analyse supergravity - eld theory dualities we should determine the
(range of) validity of the supergravity and eld theory descriptions. this leads to the
following restrictions.

the supergravity solution can be trusted when

i. the string coupling is small: gs = e  1 with e given in eq. (60).
ii. the curvatures are small: d =(cid:0)dpne(2k)(cid:1)2/ d  1 with d given by eq. (61).

the perturbative eld theory is valid when

iii. the eective coupling constant g2

e dened by (62) is small, i.e. g2

f ux  1.
we do not expect that we can relate supergravity to eld theory in a well dened way for
generic values of the parameters a, k and x. in the ads case, corresponding to a = 0, the
limit is well dened in the supergravity background and we can relate supergravity on the
ads background to a superconformal eld theory. this case has been well studied.

e = g2

19

whenever a 6= 0, the dilaton background will generically spoil the nice behaviour in
the low energy limit. with nice we mean that there are nite regions in the supergrav-
ity background where perturbative supergravity is valid, i.e. condition (61) is satised.
for dpbranes however we know from the work [1, 9] that things work out nicely, so a
straightforward proposal would be to constrain the analysis to pbranes which behave
like dpbranes in d = 10. for dpbranes we know that there exists another energy
parameter u = r/, related to the length of stretched strings, which can be kept xed
in the low energy limit at the same time as the holographic energy parameter u. this
implies that the relation between u and u only involves xed quantities. in general the
relation between these two energy parameters is

f(cid:19) 2
we propose to restrict ourselves to those pbranes for which (63) does not involve  and
gs. this constrains k and x to be equal to (whenever a 6= 0)

k = 1 ,

x =   d .

(64)

note that the above restrictions are also satised for the a = 0 case provided that  = 1.
table 5 shows that these are exactly the cases where the ads background is embedded
in a string theory. the other values of  ( = 1
2 or  = 2) correspond to theories without
a string coupling constant like m-theory.

the nice thing about the second formula in (64) is that it immediately tells us which
coupling constant in the pbrane eld theory we should keep xed. for d = 10 and n = 1
we nd x = p  3, which corresponds to the scaling of the yang-mills coupling constant.
hence, for dpbranes in ten dimensions we should keep the yang-mills coupling constant
xed. the constraints (64) imply that the condition (59) is always satised. they also
ensure that in the dilaton background all dependence on gs disappears:

e =

.

(65)

this expression for the dilaton background will guarantee the existence of nite regions
in the background where perturbative supergravity is valid, i.e. (61) is satised. in fact,
in the expression (61) all n-dependence will drop out. so we conclude that (64) is a
sucient condition on k and x for obtaining (well behaved) supergravity - eld theory
dualities whenever a 6= 0. we have not proven that it is also a necessary condition, but
we have not found any counterexamples either. as we should expect, imposing k = 1 will
generically relate the pbranes to intersecting dpbranes in ten dimensions (reduced over
the relative transverse directions).

20

3.2 pure ads cases

the cases where the near-horizon geometry is a pure anti-de-sitter spacetime (a = 0)
are considerably simpler, both from the supergravity point of view as well as from the
eld theory point of view, since the full conformal symmetry of the background is left
unbroken. the supersymmetric pure ads cases have been listed in table 5, subsection
2.3.

for these cases the solution (53) reduces to

ds2 = "(cid:16) u
r(cid:17)2

dx2

u(cid:19)2
d +(cid:18)r

(66)

the (t hooft) coupling constant g2
, this means x = 0.

f of the pbrane eld theory should be independent of

for the pure ads cases the parameters  and  are equal to (see subsection 2.3)

the harmonic function now becomes

h = 1 + (lf )d(cid:20)g2

f (cid:16) u
r(cid:17)

cp(cid:19)(cid:21)1/
d (cid:18) dp

,

(67)

(68)

where lf is some fundamental length scale, for backgrounds in a string theory this is just
, but for other theories, like m-theory, this should be lp (the planck length). because
d > 0, the low energy limit lf  0 always takes us into the near-horizon region, dened
by h  .
when embedded in a string theory, we can trust the background solution when the string
coupling and the curvature are small (gs  0 and d  1). looking at (61) (taking k = 1
and e = gs) we see that we need
(69)

n gs  1 ,

which can only be satised for large n. when not discussing embeddings in string the-
ory, we loose the parameter gs and we only have to require small curvature, which can
again only be satised for large n. this then immediately leads us to the (by now well
established) conjecture that large n superconformal eld theory is dual to supergravity
on a (pure) ads background.

3.3 conformally at cases

in this subsection we analyse the conformally at cases. conformally at cases have
 = 0, for which the solution (53) no longer is dened. however, the singular  dependence

21

can be removed by transforming the holographic energy scale u to the brane energy scale
u using (63). since this transformation requires the conditions (64) to be satised in
order for it to be independent of  and gs we will from now on restrict ourselves to those
cases. combining this with the fact that  = 0 yields

x = d =

=

d  2

,

a = 1.

(70)

in the next section where we discuss the dpbranes (x = p  3) and dpbranes (x =
p  1) we will see that condition (64) is indeed satised for the conformally at cases
(corresponding to p = 5 for dpbranes and p = 2 for dpbranes). in terms of the energy
scale u the solution (53) with  = 0 is regular:

ds2

u (cid:19)2
d +(cid:18)du

so that the metric has the explicit form of a minkowski space times a sphere: md+1s d+1.
expressing the harmonic function in terms of the xed quantities u and gf we get

h = 1 +(cid:16)(cid:17)

g2

cp(cid:19) .
f u d(cid:18)dp

(75)

and we see that the low energy limit takes us into the near-horizon region and our analysis
is consistent.

we can trust the supergravity background solution when the curvature and the dilaton
are small. plugging the dilaton into (61) (recall k = 1 in this case) we nd small curvature
when   1. however in that region, as long as d > 0 we have a large dilaton, suggesting
we should turn to the s-dual description. on the other hand the perturbative eld theory
description is appropriate when   1. as long as d > 0 we nd the same behaviour for
all conformally at cases.

22

in the ads cases the near-horizon throat, in the low energy limit, closes and we end up
with a near-horizon spacetime with a boundary, disconnected from the asymptotic region.
this does not happen in the conformally at cases. the near-horizon spacetime has no
boundary where we can naturally place the dual eld theory and is not disconnected from
the innite throat region. particles in this background can propagate into the throat
region, as opposed to the ads cases, where the boundary prohibits such eects (massive
particles can not even reach the boundary). this means the throat region should be
included in the dual description [8].

4 examples

in this section we will perform a more detailed investigation for some specic, super-
symmetric, examples. when we have a nontrivial dilaton (a 6= 0) our analysis will be
restricted to pbranes with k = 1 and x =   d, for reasons explained in the previous
section.
in subsection 4.1 we will rst discuss the d = 10 dpbranes, including the
d8brane. in the next subsection we will discuss the dpbranes in d = 6 preserving only
8 supersymmetries. in the next section we will focus our attention on the dierent black
holes in d = 10, 6, 5, 4 and the quantum mechanical models related to them.

4.1 ten-dimensional dpbranes

the dpbranes, except for the d8brane, have already been discussed in [8, 9]. we refer
to these papers for more details. the purpose of this subsection is to shortly review these
papers using the notation of this paper.

all dpbranes, in a low energy limit, are described by a super yang-mills theory. the
yang-mills coupling constant for dpbranes in d = 10 follows from expanding the dirac-
born-infeld action

(76)

where the numerical factor cp is equal to cp = (2)p2 when considering ten-dimensional
dpbranes. the scaling x with ls is given by x = p  3 =  d, so the coupling constant
we would like to keep xed is the t hooft coupling constant g2

f = g2

in the low energy limit the scalars in the yang-mills theory will decouple. other param-

a = 1

(78)

as was shown in a more general context (k = 1 and x =   d), the constraint (59)
is satised and we are able to x two energy quantities at the same time. the specic
relation between the two energy scales u and u for dpbranes is given by

u 5p = g2

we can freely choose between them corresponding to considering holographic supergravity
probes or dp brane probes. the explicit values of the constants dp and cp can be found
in the appendix.
to keep g2
f xed for p < 3 we do not need to tune n, because we always take gs to be
small (for the supergravity solution to be valid we need low energy and small coupling).
for p > 3 we have to take n to innity to keep g2
f xed. as is well known, in the special
case that p = 3 we loose the non-trivial dilaton and obtain a pure ads5  s5 background.
the case p = 5 is special because it is conformally at. this case was already discussed
in subsection 3.3. we will not discuss the case p = 7 corresponding to d = 0.
plugging in the dierent parameters the dilaton background (60) takes the form

we see that by making n large, we can always make the dilaton small, except when we
approach the points u = 0 or u = , depending on p. this analysis coincides with [9]
and we refer to that paper for a more detailed discussion of all dpbranes with p < 8.
we have summarized some of the results in table 6.

we would now like to focus our attention on the only dpbrane missing in previous
discussions, the d8brane.

(81)

which means that the the dilaton background is small everywhere as long as we take large
n. this is necessary anyway since, in order to keep g2
f for the d8brane xed, we need
n  . this means that we consider the t hooft limit of the (non-renormalizable) eld
theory. only when we approach u =  the dilaton grows and we have to consider the
s-dual situation which would involve m9branes in m-theory. we would like to point out
that in the limit n  , the size of the region where the dilaton is large can be made
as small as a point. in the present case of the d8brane u =  is the actual position of
the d8-domain wall, as opposed to branes with p < 6, where u = 0 denotes the position
of the brane.

this also happens for the d6brane (although in that case we need to go to the strong
coupling background which involves the d = 11 kkmonopole and in d = 11 gravity does
not decouple) and would suggest a contradiction in the sense that we have two, apparently
dierent, weakly coupled descriptions. one reason could be that the decoupling of gravity
of the eld theory in these cases is rather subtle [8, 9]. however as we discussed earlier,
when xing the t hooft coupling constant, the decoupling of gravity in the t hooft limit
of the eld theory seems guaranteed for all branes. one reason not to trust the decoupling
of gravity is the fact that gsn is the open string coupling constant, which becomes innite
in this case. two open strings can join to form closed strings (which includes gravitons).
it is hard to understand why the strongly coupled open string theory would not produce
these closed strings (and thus decouple from gravity) in the low energy limit15. for now
however we conjecture that dw10 supergravity near u = 0 equals d = 9 perturbative
sym theory in the t hooft limit. another proposal for the interpretation of this result,
although not unrelated to the decoupling of gravity argument, can be found in [11]. in
any case, it is interesting to note that the d6- and d8brane behave in similar ways, a
point of view that is also advocated from considering the embedding of these branes in
m-theory (where they both develop an extra compact direction) [14].

we end this subsection with table 6 in which we summarise the results for ten-dimensional
dpbranes.

4.2 six-dimensional dpbranes
using the constraint x =   d = p  1, the relevant dynamics should be governed by
scalars. because these dpbranes are related to intersecting dpbranes the worldvolume
theory should again contain supersymmetric yang-mills. however, the yang-mills cou-
pling constant in this case is not kept xed but instead diverges. as we mentioned in
subsection 3.1, when we consider the dpbranes on top of each other, we are in the higgs
branch vacuum of the theory. in the limit of diverging yang-mills coupling constant all
the vectors decouple and we are left with a scalar theory. the (scalar) coupling constant
we keep xed is

f = cpngs

we see that until now the analysis resembles quite accurately that of the d = 10 dp
branes.

in the following we will ignore the cases p = 1 (no dilaton), p = 2 (conformally at, see
subsection 3.3) and p = 3 ( d = 0). to keep g2
f xed for p = 0 we nd that it is possible
but not necessary for n to go to innity. for p = 4 we have to take n to innity to keep
g2
f xed.

focusing on the d0 and d4brane, we next analyse where the eld theory and supergravity
description are valid using (62) and (61). for the d0brane we nd that the perturbative
eld theory description is valid near u =  and the (s-dual) supergravity description is
valid near u = 0:

u  g2
u  g2

f 
f 

f t ,

sugra .

(88)

this is the typical behaviour in eld theorysupergravity dualities, both descriptions
being valid in dierent regions, avoiding contradictions. for the d0brane it mimics the
ten-dimensional d0brane situation. as is clear from the above we should turn to the

26

s-dual background in the infrared. but what is the s-dual background? we know that
iia superstring theory on a k3 manifold is s-dual to heterotic superstring theory on a
t 4. the s-dual solution is nothing but the 0brane of heterotic string theory on t 4,
where the extreme black hole is charged with respect to a kaluza-klein gauge eld or
with respect to a u(1) subgroup of the so(32) gauge elds. this solution is fundamental
in the sense that its mass is independent of gs (like the fundamental string) and it has
a curvature singularity at u = 0. this curvature singularity should be resolved by the
strong coupling limit of the corresponding quantum mechanics on the d0branes. in this
respect this situation resembles the d1-f1 situation in iib superstring theory in d = 10
[8]. it would be interesting to explicitly determine the infrared limit of the corresponding
quantum mechanics model. we will say more about this case in the next section when
we discuss 0branes in various dimensions.

for the d4brane the situation is similar to that of the d8-domain-wall in d = 10. we
nd that the eld theory and supergravity description are valid in the same region near
u = 0 apparently leading to a contradiction:

(89)

as was explained in the previous subsection, we have no good explanation for this puzzling
situation. our results suggest the equivalence between dw6 supergravity near u = 0 and
a d = 5 perturbative (scalar) eld theory, which is the higgs branch of a d = 5 sym
theory with 8 supercharges, in the t hooft limit (n  ). for arguments in favor of
another interpretation of this result we refer to [11]. near u =  we should use the
s-dual background, which should be embedded in heterotic string theory on t 4. this
involves the d = 10 heterotic solitonic 5brane with one leg of the 5brane wrapped
around the t 4. note that the d = 10 interpretation of the d4brane is a delocalized d4-
d8 brane solution of type iia string theory. duality conjectures based upon a localized
d4-d8brane system embedded in type i string theory have been discussed in [24, 25].

this nishes our discussion on dpbranes preserving 8 supersymmetries. all features of
d = 10 dpbranes reappear in the d = 6 context. in table 7 we have summarised our
results on the six-dimensional dpbranes.

discussion in the text).

5 quantum mechanics and 0branes

in this section we will consider the special case of 0branes in various dimensions. in
particular, we will construct the hamiltonian of the (boundary) quantum mechanics. we
expect the hamiltonian to be invariant under (generalized) conformal transformations
because of the (conjectured) duality between the supergravity theory and the boundary
theory. because the metric is pure ads, the isometries of the metric will induce the
conformal invariance in the boundary qm. it is clear that a non-trivial dilaton breaks the
conformal isometries of the background. as will be explained we can only expect to nd
generalized conformal invariance [26] in those cases.

models of (super) conformal quantum mechanics have been studied in [27, 28]. the
relation of these models with black holes was pointed out recently in [29]. the exact map
between d = 2 (pure) ads (quantum) supergravity and the quantum mechanics model at
the boundary, requires a special discussion and is not yet well understood [2, 30, 31, 32].

we will rst give a general discussion, applicable to any dimension. next we will focus
on the special supersymmetric cases in d = 10 (the d0brane), d = 6 (the d0brane,
already partially discussed in the previous section) and the pure ads cases in d = 5 (the
m0brane) and d = 4 (the reissner-nordstrom extreme black hole). the rn-black hole
and the d0brane have already been discussed in [29] and [33], respectively. we will show
that these cases t naturally into our general analysis.

to construct the quantum mechanics hamiltonian we consider a charged probe particle
in the (supersymmetric) near-horizon background of n stacked 0branes. whenever we
have a nontrivial dilaton we will restrict ourselves to those cases for which the conditions
(64) which for p = 0 read k = 1 and x =   d + 3. the (bosonic) lagrangian for a
particle with mass m and charge q, moving in the dual frame (near-horizon) background
of n stacked 0branes then reads

l = m lg

(90)

where the dot represents derivatives with respect to the worldline time and l is the
(dimensionless) parameter dened in appendix a (see also section 3). the d-dimensional
0brane solution in the dual frame metric g(d)
is given by the expression (53), taken for

p = 0. this expression is constant in  units.
introducing the canonical momentum
p = l x we can write down the mass-shell constraint for the probe particle which is

we would like to substitute the expressions for the dierent background elds and see
if we can simplify the expressions for f and g. note that we use the electric potential
instead of the dual magnetic potential we are using in the rest of the paper. the solution
for the (electric) vector potential is

at = (gsh)1 .

(95)

the expression for the dilaton is given in (53), but we restrict ourselves to cases with
k = 1 and x =   d + 3 so we can use the dilaton expression in (65). the reader may
now check that for all supersymmetric 0branes in the near-horizon limit, the following
identity holds:

d4

d3  = (dpn)1/(d3)  ,

(96)

this identity enables us to simplify the expressions for f and g considerably. introducing
a function v(u) which is equal to

v(u) = (dpn)

u(cid:19)2

we can write the functions f and g as follows:

(98)

from this form of f and g it is clear that in the eld theory limit (  0) the quan-
tum mechanics model is well dened because m and q have (implicit)  dependence
(m, q  1/) cancelling all s appearing in f and g. we also see that in the extreme
limit (m2 = q2) the function g simplies considerably: g = r2 ~l2
u2 . this is the centrifugal
potential for a free particle. except for a conformal factor in f (depending on u) and
the somewhat unusual u dependence of v(u), this should be a hamiltonian of (relativis-
tic) conformal quantum mechanics as described in [29] as long as we keep the dilaton
term in (97) xed under conformal transformations. the appearance of the udependent
conformal factor (and the particular udependence of v(u)) is the result of our choice
of phase space canonical variables (u, pu) and can be changed by making another choice
of canonical variables. because v(u) is just a power of u, when we take u  v(u)1/4 and
rewrite the hamiltonian using the canonical variables u and pu, we remove the position
dependence in this conformal factor in f . the non-relativistic limit [29] is one in which
the function v(u) goes to innity and the expression v(u) (m2  q2) is kept xed. in
that limit, except for an innite conformal factor which can be removed by using another
canonical set of variables, we obtain the conformal quantum mechanics of [27].

the generators of special conformal and dilatation transformations are equal to

k = f u2

, d = upu .

(99)

together with the generator of time translations, the hamiltonian h, these generators
satisfy the following sl(2, r) algebra [28]

[h,d] = h ,

[d,k] = k ,

[h,k] = d .

(100)

this is only true when the eective coupling constant g2
ef f of the qm model under con-
sideration is xed under scale transformations. whenever we have a non-trivial dilaton
the qm model will not be conformal invariant by itself. only when introducing a trans-
formation of g2
ef f xed under conformal transformations, will the qm model
be invariant under what are called generalized conformal transformations [26].

we will now discuss as special cases the supersymmetric black holes in d = 10, 6, 5, 4.

(101)

remember that there is some u dependence hidden in g2
ef f and that the model is
invariant under generalized conformal transformations keeping g2
ef f xed. the ex-
pression diers from the one given in [33]. performing a coordinate transformation,
going from the variables u and pu to the canonical variables u and pu (using (63))
we loose the position dependence of the conformal factor in f and we obtain the
result of [33]. we refer to that paper and [32] for more details on the relation of
this model with (m)atrix theory.

 the d = 6 d0brane. for d = 6 the function v(u) is given by

ef f!(cid:18)r
v(u) = ndp  ncp
u(cid:19)2
rg2

.

(102)

as in the previous example, there is hidden u dependence in g2
ef f and the model is
therefore invariant under generalized conformal transformations keeping g2
ef f xed.
the canonical set of variables (r, pr) will remove the position dependence of the
conformal factor in f if u  r4 (this means we can not use u, which is proportional
to u, as we did in the d0brane case). considering the extremal case and purely
radial motion (~l2 = 0), the large u (small v) limit should be considered ultra-
relativistic and the small u (large v) limit should be considered a classical limit
of the quantum mechanics model in the sense that the correction terms to m in
the function f can be neglected. this suggests that the singularity in the heterotic
0brane solution (see subsection 4.2) is resolved by a (classical) free conformal
quantum mechanics model. this would be in correspondence with the resolution of
the singularity in the fundamental string solution by a free orbifold conformal eld
theory [37].

 the d = 5 m0brane. for d = 5 the function v(u) is given by

u(cid:19)2
v(u) = ndp(cid:18)r

.

(103)

the main dierence with the previous cases is the fact that we no longer have
hidden u dependence in some eective coupling constant g2
ef f . this qm model is
conformal invariant without having to introduce an extra scaling law for g2
f which
is a consequence of the fact that the background is pure ads.

31

 the d = 4 extreme rn-black hole. for d = 4 the function v(u) is

given by

u(cid:19)2
v(u) = (ndp)2(cid:18)r

,

(104)

which is the same as the expression for the m0brane, except for a factor of ndp.
again this is not the same as the expression in [29], because of the dierent phase
space variables we are using.

so far, we have been considering the conformal quantum mechanics model of a single
0brane. it has been argued recently [34] that the quantum mechanical model governing
the uctuations of n stacked 0branes is given by the nparticle calogero model. this
is based on the observation that the nparticle calogero model is related, in the large
n limit, to the reduction of a d = 2 yang-mills theory describing the uctuations of n
stacked 1branes.

the expression of the nparticle calogero hamiltonian, acting on the subspace of totally
symmetric wavefunctions, is given by

h = 1

here  is a constant and (qi, pi) (i = 1,   n) are a set of 2n canonical variables. in terms
of the coupled momentum operators

i = pi + xi6=j

kij
qi  qj

,

(106)

where kij are the so-called exchange operators, the calogero hamiltonian can be brought
into the free form [35]

2

h =xi

(107)

in terms of annihilation and creation operators (ai, ai ) satisfying a so-called sn extended
heisenberg algebra the hamiltonian can be written as [36]

h = 1

2xi

{ai, ai} .

(108)

in terms of these operators the generators of the sl(2, r) algebra (100), which is called
the vertical sl(2, r) algebra, are given by the calogero hamiltonian h and the two
operators

32

b+

2 = 1

2xi

(ai )2 ,

b2 = 1

2xi

(ai)2 .

(109)

the point we want to make here is that the calogero hamiltonian is also part of another
so-called horizontal sl(2, r) algebra with generators {l1, l0, l1} such that l0  h is
a pure constant and the other two generators are given by

ai ,

l1 = xi
l1 = xi h(ai )2ai + (1  )ai(ai )2i + 2(  1

2)xi

ai ,

(110)

with ,  arbitrary constants.
it turns out that this horizontal sl(2, r) algebra can
naturally be extended to a virasoro algebra which acts as a kind of spectrumgenerating
algebra of the calogero model. for more details, see [38]16. it would be interesting to see
whether this hidden virasoro symmetry will play a role in the microscopic description of
black holes in terms of the calogero model.

6 the type i/heterotic 6brane

in this section we will discuss some properties of the type i/heterotic 6brane solution
we discussed in subsection 2.3 as an example of a brane whose near-horizon geometry is
a conformally at space. we will only discuss some classical aspects of the solution and
not the eld theory limit so that this section can be read independent from the previous
sections.

the type i/heterotic 6brane is magnetically charged under an u(1) subgroup of the
10-d yang-mills gauge eld. the complete solution reads

ds2

6 = dt2 + dy2
fmn = mnpph

,

e2 = h ,

1 +    + dy2

6 + h 2 d~xd~x ,

(111)

with m, n = 1, 2, 3 and h is a harmonic function in the transverse coordinates ~x =
(x1, x2, x3). the rst thing to notice is, that this solution is not supersymmetric in 10
dimensions. namely, the heterotic susy variations of the gravitino m , the dilatino  and

16 recently, it has been shown that any scale-invariant mechanics of one variable has the symmetries

of a full virasoro algebra [39].

(113)

since the torsion is trivial for the type i/heterotic 6brane solution, none of these varia-
tions can vanish (assuming that the killing spinor does not depend on the world volume
directions). so how is this solution related to the other supersymmetric branes? in het-
erotic string theory we have only the ns5brane and the kkmonopole which give rise
to magnetic charges and the bound state of both is given by

ds2

5kk = dt2 + dy2

h4mn = mnpph1

5 + h1h 1

h2

(dx4 + vmdxm)2 + h2d~xd~xi ,

mh2 = mnpnvp

,

e2 = h1 .

(114)

obviously, in order to obtain the 6brane we must identify the two harmonics: h1 = h2.
however, upon reduction to 9 dimensions the gauge elds coming from this bound state
enter only the rightmoving sector (see e.g. [40]), but the gauge eld coming from the
6brane is part of the leftmoving sector. therefore, there cannot be any heterotic o(2,1)-
duality that relates both to each other. instead, in order to nd a correspondence we have
to make sure that the 9-dimensional gauge elds are in the same sector, which can be
done by changing the sign of the torsion, i.e. we replace (114) by

ds2

5kk = dt2 + dy2

1 +    + dy2

h4mn = mnpph

,

5 +h(dx4 + vmdxm)2 + h 2d~xd~xi ,

e2 = h ,

mh = mnpnvp

,

(115)

where the subscript 5  kk indicates that we consider a bound state of an anti-5brane
and a kkmonopole. the equations of motions are invariant under this sign change, but
it breaks supersymmetry! after reducing over x4 the 9-dimensional gauge elds have now
the same chirality and can be rotated into each other. in fact the 6brane is related to
(115) by the o(2, 1) transformation

there is no wilson line created by this duality, i.e. vx = 0. the dilaton and the com-

r6 =

(118)

i.e. the string coupling constant as well as the compactication radius are only half of
the original values. thus, the 6brane can be seen as a bound state of an anti-5brane
and a kkmonopole at the self-dual radius (dened by h1 = h2 giving r5kk = 1),
as discussed in [42]. related examples of non-supersymmetric brane solutions have been
dicussed in [43, 44].

it is easy to construct intersections of 6branes. since the worldvolume directions trivially
factorizes for the 6brane, it is straightforward to combine up to three 6branes

ds2

666 = dt2 + h 2
,
mn = mnpphi

f i

1 d~x1d~x1 + h 2

2 d~x2d~x2 + h 2

3 d~x3d~x3 ,

e2 = h1h2h3 ,

(119)

where ~xi are the coordinates of three 3-dimensional subspaces (i = 1   3). we see, that
two 6branes intersect over a 3brane (common worldvolume) and all three intersect over
a point. introducing polar coordinates the harmonic functions can be written as

hi = 1 +

qi
ri

.

(120)

taking the limit where we can ignore the constant parts in hi and introducing ri = qieqiyi
the metric and dilaton becomes
666 = dt2 + dy2

e2 = eqiyi

1 + dy2

2 + dy2

(121)

ds2

3 + q2

i d(i)

2

,

.

hence, we get a linear dilaton and the geometry is m4  s2  s2  s2 where m4 is a at
4-dimensional minkowski spacetime.

the type i/heterotic 6brane has also an electric dual, which can be constructed by re-
ducing the 6brane to 4 dimension and applying the standard rules of s-duality and a sub-
sequent oxidation to 10 dimensions. as a result one nds the following type i/heterotic
0brane solution:

h 2 dt2 + dy2

ds2

0 =  1
a0 = 1/h

1 +    + dy2
9 ,
e2 = h .

,

35

(122)

in analogy to the 6brane this type i/heterotic 0brane can be obtained via an o(2, 1)
t-duality from an anti-string  wave bound state at the self-dual radius. using the o(2, 1)
transformation it is straightforward to construct a bound state of a 6- and a 0brane which
is given by

dt2 + h 2

1 d~xd~x + dy2

1 +    + dy2
6 .

(123)

ds2 = 

1
h 2
0

this solution can immediately be veried by compactifying all y coordinates which yields
the standard dyonic reissner-nordstrom black hole.

7 conclusions

in this paper, we presented a systematic overview of the near-horizon geometry of any
two-block pbrane solution and discussed the corresponding domain-wall/qft duality,
thereby generalizing the discussion of [8, 9]. the near-horizon geometry of the general
pbrane solution is singular, but the singularity is only contained in a conformal factor;
for all pbranes the weyl-tensor is regular. in fact, in a conformally rescaled so-called
dual frame, the spacetime factorizes into an anti-de sitter space and a sphere [5, 6]. the
analysis of appendix b shows, that this dual frame metric coincides with the sigma-
model metric [47], which enters the nambu-goto action of a dual brane probe [5]. it is
for this reason that the metric is called a dual frame metric.

by reducing over the spherical part of the pbrane near-horizon geometry one obtains a
domain-wall solution. for any pbrane we established the explicit form of this domain-
wall in terms of the parameters of the original pbrane solution. there are two special
cases. first, the domain-wall can become an ads space, which corresponds to the well-
known regular branes with a trivial dilaton. second, the domain-wall can become at.
in 10 dimensions this is the case for the 5branes and for the heterotic/type i 6brane.
the latter case is new and was discussed in section 6.
in particular, we showed that
the heterotic/type i 6brane is t-dual to the bound state of an anti-5brane and a kk
monopole at the self-dual radius and thus it is not supersymmetric.

the main goal of this work was to discuss the eld theory limit of pbranes in a general
setup. the starting point for the analysis was the fact that the background should be
regular and nite in  units in the low energy limit. we argued that in order for the
dw/qft dualities to be well behaved we need to restrict ourselves to d = 10 dbrane
intersections reduced over their relative directions (with identied harmonics). starting
with that working assumption we added new cases to the list of (conjectured) dualities
between eld theory and supergravity (in various dimensions) on a dwd+1  s d1 back-
ground with a non-trivial dilaton.

one new case we discussed is the domain-wall brane in d = 10 and d = 6 dimensions,
i.e. the d8brane and the d4brane. a special feature of domain-walls is that the near-
horizon limit h   corresponds to the asymptotic limit r   instead of r  0 as
for all the other pbranes. we found that the d8brane is similar to the d6brane in

36

the sense that the eld theory and supergravity description are both valid in the infrared
limit u = 0. however, an important dierence is that for the d6brane we have e  1
at u = 0 and one must use the s-dual kkmonopole description whose near-horizon
geometry is the at euclidean 4-space e4 without a boundary [45]. on the other hand,
for the d8brane we have e  1 at u = 0 and one can stay in ten dimensions. this
leads to a duality between d = 10 (massive) supergravity and (the large n limit of)
d = 9 yang-mills. this duality seems unlikely and the d8brane is at present not well
understood. due to its relation with the m9brane [14] this case clearly deserves further
study.

in this work we did not discuss the boundary eld theories in detail except for the ex-
treme black holes, where we constructed the (generalized conformal) quantum mechanics
hamiltonian. an interesting case is the d0brane in d = 6 dimensions. we nd that
in the infrared limit one must use the s-dual fundamental heterotic 0brane description.
we argued that the curvature singularity of this fundamental 0brane, in correspondence
with the curvature singularity of the fundamental d = 10 string, is resolved by a free
(conformal) quantum mechanics model (see section 5). it would be interesting to study
more precisely the mechanism behind this curvature resolution.

following the conjecture of [34] we considered the n-particle calogero model as the con-
formal quantum mechanics model describing n stacked black holes. we pointed out that
the horizontal sl(2, r) symmetry of the calogero model can be extended to a virasoro
algebra. it would be interesting to see whether this virasoro symmetry can lead to any
new insight into the microscopic description of black holes.

the results of this paper have been obtained using a general setup. our hope is that
the present work will be a convenient starting point for investigating in more detail the
validity of the dierent conjectured dw/qft dualities. several issues involved in these
conjectures have not been discussed here. for instance, in some cases the worldvolume
qft involved in the dw/qft duality is non-renormalizable. this indicates, for particu-
lar regions in the parameter space, the presence of extra non-decoupled degrees of freedom
similar to the ones discussed in [21]. in this paper we discussed duality conjectures which
can be related to delocalized dpbrane intersections. due to this we have not been very
precise about the vacuum structure of the dual quantum eld theory. to improve this
one should consider localized intersections like in [24, 25, 46]. we hope to report on this
and other issues in the near future.

a charge conventions

in this appendix we specify our charge conventions. in d = 10 we use the convention
l2
s =  which is understood to be replaced by the planck length lp in other dimensions.
the charge of a pbrane is dened by

p =

=

1

16gd zs d+1
 d+1q
16gd

,

f d+1

where the angular volume of a sphere at transverse innity of the brane is given by

 d+1 =

d+2

2

2
( d+2
2 )

.

(124)

(125)

expressing the bps relation between charge and mass in terms of the ux p and the
eective tension p , we have for n coincident branes

when we dene a basic charge q with a (natural) unit of [l]1 as

p = np16gd p.

nq 

 d+1vp q
16gd

,

(126)

(127)

where vp is the spatial volume of the pbrane, and use that p = m/vp, then the bps
relation in terms of the quantities m and q naturally reads m = q.

using scaling arguments (see appendix b) we nd for p in the string frame

with

p =

2
(2ls)d gk

s

,

k =

a
2

+

2d
d  2

.

we have for newtons constant in d dimensions:

16gd =

(2ls)d2

g2
s.

using the above we can express q in terms of gs and ls

q =

(2ls) d
 d+1

ng2k

s

.

39

(128)

(129)

(130)

(131)

we can relate q to r0 by

q = d r

b the sigma model metric

in this paper we have been working with two kinds of metric: the einstein metric ge and
the regular dual frame metric gd. the einstein metric is dened as the metric frame in
which there is no dilaton factor in front of the einstein term, like in (14). the regular
metric was dened in (23) and is the metric frame in which the pbrane solution (16) has
a regular near-horizon metric, like in (29).

in this section we consider a third metric frame: the sigma model metric g [47]. given
a d-form gauge potential c, it is dened as the metric in which the sigma model action
containing the d-form potential c has a dilaton-independent eective brane tension  d1.
to be more precise, consider the action

where sd is the target space action given in (14) and id is the following sigma model
action

stotal = sd + id ,

(135)

id = t d1z d

d (cid:26)qdetix m jx n g,m n
x m dcm1m d

+i1i d i1x m1    i d

+   (cid:9) ,

(136)

with t d1 the brane tension parameter. we have only indicated the standard nambu-
goto term and the leading term of the wess-zumino contribution. the eective brane
tension  in the einstein frame is given by

and is independent of the dilaton only in the sigma model metric g given by

 d1 = t d1 [()]

d/2

g = ()ge .

40

(137)

(138)

to determine the scale factor () we follow the procedure of [47] and require that the
total action (135) scales homogeneously under the scaling transformations

requiring that each term in the action scales with the same factor we nd:

ge  ge ,

e  e ,

c d   dc d .

2
 

from which we deduce that

 ,

d/21 =  d = d/21 da2 d ,

 = e( a

d ) ,

 = 

2 d
d2 ,

 = 

2d d

(d2)a .

we thus nd, in particular, that

g = e( a

d )ge .

(139)

(140)

(141)

(142)

comparing with the denition (23) of the regular dual frame metric we conclude that

in terms of g the precise scaling transformations are given by

g = gd .

such that

g  2g ,
e  
c d  

2d d
(d2)a e ,
dc d ,

stotal   dstotal .

(143)

(144)

(145)

note that the sigma model metric g is dened independent of any solution but that the
denition of the regular dual frame metric gd is related to a particular solution. in the
identity (143) it is understood that gd is related to a pbrane solution (in the magnetic
formulation) whereas g refers to a sigma model referring to the dual ( d  1)brane.
we conclude that a brane moving in a background of its dual brane does not see any
spacetime singularity. for instance, a d2brane in 10 dimensions that probes a (dual)
d4brane will enter an anti-de sitter space in the near-horizon region. on the other
hand probing a d4brane with a (nondual) d1-string, that couples to the string metric,
leads to a singular geometry. only for the selfdual d3brane all frames are equivalent
and one always sees a regular geometry. only the d3brane has a zero dilaton, for all

41

other dpbranes the dilaton is singular indicating a strongly or weakly coupled region
corresponding to a free eld theory either in the uv or ir xed points.

we nally note that there is yet a third kind of metric: the usual string frame metric gs.
it is dened as the metric in which the einstein term is multiplied by a dilaton factor e2
and the dilaton kinetic term carries a factor 4 in front. in terms of the einstein metric
ge it is given by17

the string metric gs coincides with the sigma model metric g and/or the regular metric
gd if

gs = e

d2 ge .
