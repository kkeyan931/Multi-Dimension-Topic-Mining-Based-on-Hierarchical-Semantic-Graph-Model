breaks supersymmetry (either via orbifolding supersymmetric manifold {$9802183$}, means ). another approach (related previous one {$9902110$}) uses type 0 string theory {$9811035$}. discussing nonsupersymmetric theories one usually appeals classical 11d supergravity (i.e., leading term momentum expansion) classical string theory, correspond n = . trying extend discussion large nite n one generically runs problems.  following two problems discussed: 1. n = elds whose masses breitenlohner-freedman unitar- ity bound, masses might pushed bound 1/n corrections. 2. massless elds (i.e. elds correspond marginal operators n = ) invariant symmetries, 1/n corrections may shift vevs signicantly may stable vacuum nite n , vacuum exists, may qualitatively dierent n = starting point. shown , however, easy construct models problems arise. another problem discuss paper fate directions present n = . many nonsupersymmetric gauge theories converge, formal sense least, theory sixteen supercharges n {$9803076$}, limit scalar potential directions. directions typically lifted 1/n eects, result elds either driven away origin attracted origin (or combination dierent directions). former case vacuum origin destabilized (in fact, theory may stable vacuum all), latter case origin least perturbatively stable. latter case generically mass gap, explaining hard construct nonsupersymmetric
