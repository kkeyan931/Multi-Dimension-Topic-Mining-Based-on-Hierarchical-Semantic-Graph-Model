a non-fock fermion toy model

boris tsirelson

abstract

recent progress in mathematical theory of random processes pro-
vides us with non-fock product systems (continuous tensor products
of hilbert spaces) used here for constructing a toy model for fermions.
some state vectors describe innitely many particles in a nite region;
the particles accumulate to a point. electric charge can be assigned
to the particles, the total charge being zero. time dynamics is not
considered yet, only kinematics (a single time instant).

introduction

non-interacting particles are quanta of free quantum elds.1 corresponding
hilbert spaces, known as fock spaces,2 are direct sums of n-particle spaces
for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . interacting particles are3 described by nonlinear quantized
elds that do not t into fock spaces.

fock spaces are also discussed by mathematicians in the context of prod-
uct systems, that is, continuous tensor products of hilbert spaces (see [1]
and references therein) and white noise (see [4, 3]). non-classical noises
found recently in stochastic analysis (especially [10]; see also [9]) are a source
of non-fock product systems. it is natural to look at these systems from the
viewpoint of quantum eld theory. i try to do so in the present text by com-
bining some ideas of anatoly vershik (the initiator of the trend), jonathan
warren, and mine.

toy models considered here are quite poor in several aspects. especially,
dynamics is neglected at all, and particles are treated as utterly local in space
(see sect. 3.3). nevertheless, we may hope for some hints toward more useful
rigorous non-fock constructions.

1 the idea

1.1 lattice fermions

the model can be described at once using notions of stochastic analysis (see
sect. 2). however, for the beginning i prefer discrete approximations. so,
we assume for now that our physical space is a one-dimensional lattice
z = {. . . ,2,, 0, , 2, . . .}; we ascribe a two-dimensional hilbert space
hk to each lattice point k; we introduce on hk fermionic operators ak
(annihilation), ak (creation), satisfying car (canonical anticommutation
relations4) akak + akak = 1, a2
k = 0; we consider the tensor product5
hz of all hk containing the vacuum6 vector 0 such that ak0 = 0 for all
k, treating now all ak as operators on hz, so that akal + alak = 0 for
k 6= l, and akal + alak = 0 for all k, l.7 of course, hz is just the usual
(fermionic) fock space; a non-fock space will appear later in the limit   0,
due to a non-classical limiting procedure. the total number of particles is the
observable nz = pk akak. its eigenvalues are 0, 1, 2, . . . the eigenspace
h (n)
z corresponding to an eigenvalue n is the n-particle space, spanned by
vectors ak1 . . . akn0 for k1 <    < kn. the number of particles on an
interval [x, y) is the observable nz
y,z =
x,z and nz
nz

x,y =pk:xk<y akak; clearly, nz

x,y+nz

= nz.

,

1.2 quantum states and classical random variables

for each lattice point k we introduce a variable k with only two possible
values 1. functions of these variables will be used as symbols of state
vectors, as follows:

(1.2.1)

function

1
k
kl

(constant)

state vector

0
ak0
akal0

(vacuum)

(k < l)

and so on; each factor k gives rise to a particle at k. extending the map
by linearity we get a unitary operator from the hilbert space l2 of all square
4physicists are acquainted with car; mathematicians may look at [5, sect. 4.6], [2,

chap. 2].

5in fact, only nite regions of the one-dimensional space will be used. the reader may
restrict himself once and for all to k  [1, +1], which makes hz nite-dimensional.
otherwise, see [2, sect. 4.5] (the direct product of grounded hilbert spaces).

6it is a simplistic vacuum, see sect. 3.3.
7to this end we identify ak  al with akal whenever k < l. the sign is chosen at

will; see also [2, th. 3.2].

let f  l2, kfk = 1. consider the probability kakfk2 = hakakif of
nding a particle at k. in terms of f , it is the so-called inuence of k on
f . for example, let  = 1 and f = f (1, 2, 3), then the inuence of 1 on f
is, by denition,

values:

a probabilist writes it as the expectation e of a conditional variance var(cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:1) ,
e var(cid:0) f(cid:12)(cid:12) 2, 3(cid:1) =

(cid:16) f (1, s2, s3) + f (1, s2, s3)

(cid:17)2(cid:19) .
similarly, the probability of nding at least one particle within the two-point
set {k, l} is the inuence of {k, l} on f . for example, the inuence of
{1, 2} on f (1, 2, 3) is

the distribution of f, tends (for   0) to the normal distribution n(0,kk2).
this way, the array of variables k over the lattice z turns (when  
0) into the white noise d
dx w (x) over r; here w is the wiener process;
k turns into dw (x). the function f, turns into the linear functional
f = r (x) dw (x). the lattice state vector f, = pk (k)ak0
turns into f = r (x)a(x)0 dx, the one-particle state with the wave

denoted by n = r a(x)a(x) dx. accordingly, nx,y = r y
x a(z)a(z) dz. still,
nx,y + ny,z = nx,z and n, = n. the standard limiting procedure leads
to the fock space h fock

for almost all k the maximum is reached only once, thus x z is a well-
dened random variable (a function of random variables k) whose values
belong to the nite piece z  [1, 1] of the lattice. also w z
x z is a ran-
dom variable. both determine state vectors x z, w z
. these are quite

complicated linear combinations of various multi-partical states. in order to
calculate them explicitly, one should evaluate fourier-walsh coecients by
averaging k1 . . . knx z and k1 . . . knw z
x z; fortunately we do not need
it. the standard limiting procedure   0 gives the wiener process w (x),
and w (x) = maxx[1,1] w (x), x = arg max[1,1] w () (also reached only
once, almost sure). fourier-walsh expansion of x z becomes wiener chaos

the function xk(x1, . . . , xk) for 1 < x1 <    < xk < 1 is the wave function
of the k-particle component of x. the squared norm of x is the average
of x 2, equal to 1/2 since arcsin x is known to be distributed uniformly on
(/2, /2). still, it happens in the fock space.
trying to escape the fock space, we consider such functions as exp(ix z)
and exp(iw z

in order to estimate (via (1.2.2)) the density of particles in the state

exp(iw z
is an average over paths of the walk. assume k  (0, 1). a path that reaches
its maximum on (1, k) gives a small (in most cases, just 0) contribution
to the inuence. a path that reaches its maximum on (k, 1) contributes (in
most cases) roughly ()2, assuming that   1/2. in the limit   0 the
same argument, applied to the wiener process, shows that the density of the
particles on (1, +1) is roughly 2; too much for taking   .
consider now the density of particles in the other state, exp(ix z). the
inuence of k on exp(ix z) is an average over paths. assume again k 
(0, 1), and consider a path that reaches its maximum on (k, 1), not too close

to k. its contribution to the inuence is in most cases exactly 0, irrespective
of . a non-zero contribution appears only when the maximum on (1, k)
is -close to the maximum on (k, 1). in that case, k inuences x z by
causing a jump of a size roughly 1. also exp(ix z) makes a jump of a size
roughly 1 irrespective of . the probability of a particle at a given point

of course, the expression exp(ix) is not a well-dened function over the
wiener process, because of its innite sensitivity to small changes of w ().
however, the sensitivity is concentrated near the maximizer. accordingly,
particles accumulate to a single point (though it does not follow from the
simple argument of the preceding paragraph).

2 the model

2.1 beyond the white noise

the wiener process is the scaling limit of the random walk, which may be
explained as follows. consider the lattice z = {. . . ,2,, 0, , 2, . . .},
another lattice z = {. . . ,2,, 0,, 2, . . .}, and maps ux,y :
z  z dened for x, y  z, x < y:

uk,l(m) = (m + k + (k+1) +    + (l1)) ;

here, as before, (k)kz is an array of independent random signs. note that
uy,z(cid:0)ux,y(u)(cid:1) = ux,z(u), that is, uy,z  ux,y = ux,z for x < y < z; all ux,y
are compositions of maps ux,x+ (x  z), these being independent; each
ux,x+ is either u 7 u +  or u 7 u  . the lattice stochastic ow
(fig. 1b) results from random alternating the two simple transformations of
z (fig. 1a). the standard limiting procedure for   0 leads to ux,y(u) =
u + w (y)  w (x), u  r, x, y  r, x  y (fig. 1c); as before, w () is the
wiener process.
now, breaking homogeneity on the u axis, we consider another pair of
transformations z  z (fig. 2a). alternating them at random we get

another lattice stochastic ow10 (fig. 2b) that has its scaling limit (fig. 2c);
well call it the splitting ow.

10the two-dimensional lattice (z)  (z) decomposes into two sublattices (even and

odd), closed under the ow. in order to get a scaling limit we restrict ourselves to one of
the two sublattices.

for large u, near +, the splitting ow does not dier from the simple

ow:

(2.1.1)

ux,y(u) = u + w (y)  w (x)

w () is still the wiener process. near  the situation is symmetric. near

ux,y(u) = (cid:0)w (y)  min

[x,y]

w ()(cid:1)

for |u| < w (x)  min

[x,y]

w () .

thus, for given x, y  r, x < y, the map ux,y : r  r is chosen at random
from a two-dimensional set g of maps,11 determined by two parameters,
11the set g is a semigroup, and a (two-dimensional) topological space. however, it
is not a group (maps are not invertible), nor even a topological semigroup (maps are
discontinuous, and the composition is a discontinuous operation on the semigroup).

w (x)  min[x,y] w () and (cid:0)w (y)  min[x,y] w ()(cid:1). the rst parameter is
uniquely determined by w (), but the second is not; its sign is a random
variable independent of w (). on the lattice, the sign is determined by the
parity (evenness) of the number k of the point k  [x, y] that minimizes
w z
k . in terms of sect. 1.4 the sign is just exp(ix) for  = / (though,
minimum is used now, rather than maximum). for   0 it turns into the
ill-formed expression exp(ix). however, the sign itself is well-dened, and
may be used as a well-formed substitute for the ill-formed expression!
the random map ux,y, that is, the family of random variables {ux,y(u) :
u  r} (for given x, y) reduces to independent components: a single random
sign vx,y = sgn ux,y(0), and increments {w (b)  w (a) : x < a < b < y} of
the wiener process. the whole splitting ow {ux,y(u) : u  r, < x <
y < +} boils down to random signs {vx,y : x < y} and wiener process
increments {w (b)  w (a) : a < b}. however, these are dependent;
(2.1.2)

e(cid:0) vx,y(cid:12)(cid:12) w ()(cid:1) = 0 ,

e(cid:0) vx1,y1vx2,y2(cid:12)(cid:12) w ()(cid:1) =(1 if arg min[x1,y1] w () = arg min[x2,y2] w (),

given w (), random signs vx,y depend on x, y only via arg min[x,y] w (),

0 otherwise.

vx,y = varg min[x,y] w () .

random signs vx are ascribed to all points x of local minima of w (). such
points are a dense countable set. in fact,

vx = lim
0

sgn ux,x+(0) ;

the limit exists if (and only if) w () has a local minimum at x.

15thus, to contain particles means to be orthogonal to 0. true, it is not a deep
denition of particles. well see soon that our particles can be localized in space (too
much for physical particles, see sect. 3.3). further they will get an electric charge, see
sect. 3.2.

we may consider the corresponding joint quantum measurement. its outcome
assigns values (0 or 1) to all nx,y respecting (2.3.1), and is interpreted as a
conguration of particles in the (one-dimensional) space. if   h fock
then
the outcome is always a nite set. for   hr the outcome can be innite.
in fact, if  is orthogonal to the fock space (that is,   hr  h fock

also [7] for a general theory of .

conguration of particles in vacuum, we always get the empty set .

if we measure the conguration of particles in a fock state, we get a random
nite set.

that is, if we measure the conguration of particles in a non-fock state

theory [8] states that {c : c  x} = 0 for every x (and ). it follows
that  is concentrated on (the set of) sets c of zero lebesgue measure. for
some models, c is always of cardinality continuum.

explicitly, by warren [10]. it is concentrated on (the set of) innite, countable
sets c with a single accumulation point (which was roughly explained here, in
sect. 1.4). that is, if we measure the conguration of particles in such a state,
we always get a random countable set with a single, random, accumulation
point.

recall the idea explained in sect. 1.4: the maximizer x = arg max[1,+1] w ()
of the wiener process is rather insensitive to changes of w () outside of a
neighborhood of x. the set of local maxima (or minima) of w () is a (ran-
dom) dense countable set. and, as explained in sect. 2.1, the insensitivity
emerges from locality of the notion of a local maximum.

turning from r to the 3-dimensional space r3, we turn from w () to the
white noise over r3; its sample function is a generalized function (schwartz
distribution) and gives a number, being integrated over some 3-dimensional
domain. the integral is a random variable distributed normally with zero
mean; its variance is equal to the volume of the domain.

a straightforward attempt to generalize arg max w () for r3 meets many
diculties. however, we need only some dense countable set of (random)
points, determined by a local property of a white noise sample function. i
am unable to nd such a property among natural, well-known properties.
instead, i am able to invent such a property.

consider the integral s(x, r) of the 3-dimensional white noise over the
3-dimensional ball b(x, r)  r3 of radius r  (0,), centered at x  r3.
given x0 and r0, we consider all x1, r1 such that b(x1, r1)  b(x0, r0) and
r1  r0/2. we choose x1, r1 maximizing |s(x1, r1)|; the maximum is reached
only once (with probability 1). having x1, r1 we choose x2, r2 in the same way:
b(x2, r2)  b(x1, r1), r2  r1/2, and (x2, r2) = arg max(x2,r2) |s(x2, r2)|. and
so on. the sequence (xn) converges to a point: xn  xx0,r0. we have a family
(cid:0)xx0,r0(cid:1)x0r3,r0(0,) of r3-valued random variables; they are functionals of
the 3-dimensional white noise. a small change of (x0, r0) does not inuence
xx0,r0, therefore the random set {xx0,r0 : x0  r3, r0  (0,)} is (at most)
countable. the set is dense, since r0 may be arbitrarily small.
now we can mimick warrens construction as follows. we introduce ran-

dom signs vx,r such that (recall (2.1.2))

e(cid:0) vx,r(cid:12)(cid:12) s(,)(cid:1) = 0 ,

e(cid:0) vx1,r1vx2,r2(cid:12)(cid:12) s(,)(cid:1) =(1 if xx1,r1 = xx2,r2,

0 otherwise.

in other words, we ascribe new random signs vx to all points of the dense
countable random set.

every smoothly bounded domain d  r3 determines its hilbert space
h fock
d , generated by s(x, r) for all (x, r) such that b(x, r)  d. also, it

12

determines a larger space hd generated by s(x, r) and vx,r for all (x, r) such
that b(x, r)  d. similarly to (2.2.1),
h fock
d  hd ,

d1  h fock
h fock
d2 = h fock
d ,
hd1  hd2 = hd

whenever d is split into two domains d1, d2 by a smooth surface.16

the random sign vx,r is identied with a state vector x,r  hd  h fock
d ,
where d = b(x, r). if we measure the conguration of particles in such a
state, we always get a random countable subset of d with a single, random,
accumulation point.

3.2 electric charge

charged particles are quanta of complex elds. for the fock model it
may be interpreted via the complex-valued (rather than real-valued) white
noise.
in one-dimensional space, every square-integrable functional of the
complex-valued wiener process z(x) = w1(x) + iw2(x) (where w1, w2 are
independent real-valued wiener processes) has its wiener chaos expansion
similar to (1.4.1), but instead of dw (x), dw (x)dw (y) and so on, we get
dz(x), dz(x), dz(x)dz(y), dz(x)dz(y), dz(x)dz(y), dz(x)dz(y) and so on;
here z(x) is the complex conjugate to z(x). the term with dz(x) de-
scribes a single particle with the charge +1; the charge 1 is described by
dz(x); dz(x)dz(y) describes two particles, one of positive charge (at x), the
other of negative charge (at y); and so on. the sector of (total) charge 0
consists of functionals invariant under the global commutative gauge group
z() 7 eiz(). the corresponding one-parameter unitary group on hr has
its generator, the observable of total electric charge q. localization to h(x,y)
gives q(x,y), the electric charge on (x, y).

as far as i know, there is no interesting generalization to z() of the idea
of sect. 1.4, based on arg max[x,y] w ().17 however, the idea of sect. 3.1 can
be used easily. still, |s(x1, r1)| is maximized, but now s(x1, r1) is a complex
number. the maximizer is invariant under z() 7 eiz(). we extend the
gauge group from h fock to h by postulating that random signs vx,r are gauge
invariant. thus, vx,r is a state vector belonging to the zero-charge sector.

16fock spaces h fock

d

can be dened also for non-smooth domains d without loss of their

natural properties, but non-fock spaces hd cannot; see [7].

17we cannot place random signs at local maxima of re z(), since re(cid:0)eiz()(cid:1) has quite
dierent local minima; the union over all  is uncountable. local minima of |z()|, that is,
of |r x
0 dz()|, lead to a theory treating the origin as a special point in the one-dimensional
space.

13

local gauge transformations z(x) 7 ei(x)z(x) determine the (innite-
dimensional, unitary) gauge group on hr (still, vx,r are gauge-invariant by
denition). the group commutes with the observables 0nx,y , which means
that we can measure both the spatial conguration of particles and (simul-
taneously) the spatial distribution of electric charge. an outcome of such
a measurement in the state vx,r is always a countable set of particles, each
having a charge 1. as was said, the set has a single accumulation point.
the charge in a neighborhood of the accumulation point is determined by
the fact that the total charge is equal to zero.

3.3 dirac sea and dynamics

non-interacting electrons (and positrons) are quanta of the free dirac quan-
tum eld,18 much more singular than our toy models. the distribution of
the electric charge can be treated as a generalized function (schwartz distri-
bution) on 4-dimensional space-time rather than 3-dimensional space; other-
wise uctuations become innite.19 in terms of the lattice approximation of
sect. 1.1 we have, roughly speaking,20

dirac

0

=(cid:18)yn (cid:18)xk

n(k)ak(cid:19)(cid:19)0 ;

here 0 is the simplistic vacuum of sect. 1.1; dirac
is the vacuum of the
free dirac quantum eld; and functions n() on the lattice z form an
orthonormal basis of a special subspace of l2(z), so-called negative energy
subspace. it is innite-dimensional, moreover, it is a half of l2(z) in the
sense that hakakidirac
= 1/2 for all k; each lattice point is occupied with
probability 1/2 (these events being correlated).

according to dirac, the vacuum is such a state: all negative-energy states
are occupied, while all positive-energy states are free. positrons are holes in
a sea of negative electrons. see [2, sect. 6.5] for a rigorous denition of
the relevant space that contains dirac
(and does not contain 0). particles
(electrons and positrons) are inherently delocalized, see [6, sect. 1].

0

what about lling in the dirac sea for non-fock models considered
here? for now it remains unclear. maybe the spatial approach to product
systems in quantum eld theory is too naive; for a dierent, 4-dimensional
approach see [1, sect. 1].

18see [5, sect. 7.2], [2, sect. 6.5].
19 see [6, sect. 7].
20the space should be 3-dimensional; a spinor index should be added to the spatial

index k; the innite product is ill-dened.
