abstract

we review the construction of the kaluza-klein monopole of the
type iia theory in the most general case of a massive background,
as well as its relation via t-duality with the type iib ns-5-brane.
this last eective action is shown to be related by s-duality to the
d5-brane eective action.

figure 1: derivation of the dierent actions considered in this paper. the (massive)
iia kk-monopole is obtained from the (massive) m-theory kk-monopole after a double
dimensional reduction. applying now t -duality in the iia kk-monopole action the type
iib ns-5-brane action is obtained, and it is s-dual to the d5-brane eective action.

the most general type iia superstring theory contains a mass param-
eter dual to the rr 9-form potential to which the d8-brane couples min-
imally [1], the corresponding low energy eective action being the massive
iia supergravity of romans [2]. an eleven dimensional interpretation of this
theory can only be found when the eleventh direction is compact [3], with
lorentz invariance taking place in the other ten dimensional coordinates4.
the explicit eleven dimensional supergravity action depends on the killing
vector associated to translations along the eleventh coordinate, and gives the
massive type iia supergravity action of romans after a direct dimensional
reduction along this direction. the eective actions of the m-branes of this
theory are described by gauged sigma-models in which the killing isometry
is gauged, with a gauge coupling constant proportional to m. two massive
branes in the type iia theory can be obtained from any such m-brane de-
pending on whether we perform a direct or a double dimensional reduction.
in particular the massive d6-brane is obtained by dimensional reduction
along the taub-nut direction of a massive m-kk-monopole in which the
two killing vectors associated to the mass and the taub-nut isometries co-
incide [5]. the construction of a massive kk-monopole in eleven dimensions
is more subtle than that of an ordinary brane, since the monopole is already
described by a gauged sigma-model in the massless case. the massless m-
theory kk-monopole [6] behaves like a 6-brane, and its eld content is that
of the 7-dimensional vector multiplet, involving 3 scalars and 1 vector. since
the embedding coordinates describe 11-7=4 degrees of freedom one scalar has
to be eliminated by gauging an isometry of the background. this isometry
is that associated to translations of the taub-nut direction of the trans-
verse space to the monopole. the massive m-kk-monopole of [5] cannot
give rise to a massive type iia kk-monopole after double dimensional re-
duction, since the gauged isometry disappears in the reduction. one needs

to construct a massive m-kk-monopole in which the two isometry directions
associated to the mass and the taub-nut space are dierent. double dimen-
sionally reducing along the direction associated to the mass will give rise to
the eective action of the massive iia kk-monopole. this explicit eective
action has been constructed in [7]. here we just summarize its worldvolume
eld content and the interpretation of these elds in terms of solitons in the
brane.

table 1: worldvolume eld content of the massive m-theory and type
iia kk-monopoles. in this table we summarize the worldvolume elds present
in the eective actions of the massive mtheory and massive iia kkmonopoles.

we nd, as in the massless case, a 1-form (1) describing a 0-brane soli-
ton in the worldvolume of the kk-monopole.
its dual 4-form describes a
3-brane soliton. they correspond to the intersections: (0|m2, mkk) and
(3|m5, mkk), respectively. the monopole contains as well a 4-brane soliton
which couples to the 5-form dual to one of the embedding scalars:
(4|mkk, mkk)1,2. all these intersections have been already discussed in the
literature for the massless monopole [8].
in the massive case we nd a new eld d(5) which couples to the 5-brane

soliton represented by the conguration5:

(5|m9, mkk) = (      z     
       z   

the 5-brane soliton predicted by the m-kk and m9-brane worldvolume su-
persymmetry algebras is realized as a 4-brane soliton given that it cannot
develop a worldvolume direction along the isometry of the m9-brane. this
is in agreement with the worldvolume eld content that we have found for
the massive m-kk-monopole, since the only worldvolume eld to which this
soliton can couple is the 5-form d(5).

the 6-form (6) is interpreted as the tension of the monopole and couples
to the 5-brane soliton realized as the embedding of an m5-brane on the
5we use here a notation where () indicates a worldvolume (transverse) direction.
the rst  in a row indicates the time direction. the z-direction in the monopole corre-
sponds to the isometry direction of the taub-nut space. a single m9-brane contains as
well a killing isometry in its worldvolume, as has been discussed in [9, 10]. this isometric
direction has been depicted as well as a z-direction.

kk-monopole. finally, (7) couples to the 6-brane soliton describing the
embedding of the monopole in an m9-brane: (6|m9, mkk). from the point
of view of the m9-brane this 6-brane soliton couples to the dual of its 1-form
vector eld [10].

the double dimensional reduction of the action of the massive m-theory
kk-monopole gives that of the massive iia kk-monopole, and it is con-
structed explicitly in [7].
its worldvolume eld content is summarized in
table 1.

the worldvolume elds that couple to the soliton solutions of a kk-
monopole are those necessary to construct invariant eld strengths for the
elds ikc (p+1) (see [11]). these eld strengths have the form:

k(p) = p(p1) +

1
2 (ikc (p+1)) + . . . ,

(1)

so that (p1) couples to a (p2)-brane soliton which describes the boundary
of a p-brane ending on the monopole, with one of its worldvolume directions
wrapped around the taub-nut direction of the monopole. the target space
eld associated to (1) is (ikc (3)) so that it describes a wrapped d2-brane
ending on the monopole. it is worth noting that the born-infeld eld does
not couple to the action, which reects the fact that there are no fundamental
strings ending on the monopole.

as in the massless case, we nd the congurations: (2|d4, kk), (3|ns5, kk)

and (3|kk, kk)1,2 [8]. when the mass is non-zero there is a new worldvol-
ume eld d(5) (associated to dual massive transformations), which couples
to a 4-brane soliton. this soliton is a domain wall in the six dimensional
worldvolume and is described by the conguration:

(4|d8, kk) = (          
      z   

which is obtained by reducing the (4|m9, kk) soliton conguration of the
m-theory kk-monopole along the isometric direction of the m9-brane. this
intersection is related by t-duality to various intersections considered in the
literature. there is as well another 4-brane soliton in the kk-monopole
worldvolume which is already present in the massless case. this is the em-
bedding of the d4-brane on the monopole: (4|d4, kk), and it couples to
the worldvolume eld (5), describing the tension of the monopole. finally,
the reduction of the 6-brane soliton (6|m9, kk) gives a 5-brane soliton cou-
pled to (6) which is realized as the embedding of the kk-monopole on a
kk-7a-brane6.

6this brane is obtained by reducing the m9-brane along a worldvolume direction other

we can now construct the eective action of the type iib ns-5-brane by
performing a (massive) t-duality transformation in the iia kk-monopole
along its taub-nut direction. the details of this calculation are presented
in [11]. the result is the following eective action:

s = tb5r d6 e2q1 + e2(c (0))2s|det(cid:18)g  (2)

f is dened as f = 2c(1) + 1/(2)c (2) and g(6) is the gauge invariant

this action is s-dual to the d5-brane eective action, with the worldvolume
elds transforming as sl(2,z) doublets. it is interesting to note that the bi
eld transforms into a 1-form c(1), and not into a 3-form as one would have
expected. this could be useful for the construction of (p,q) 5-branes.

analogously to this construction it is possible to derive the eective action
of the type iib kk-monopole by performing a t-duality transformation in
the eective action of the iia ns-5-brane (see [11]). these results show
explicitly the duality relations between the various 5-branes of the iia and
iib theories.

than the z-direction, but it is not predicted by the type iia supersymmetry algebra [12].
as discussed in [10], this is also the case for the kk-6a brane, obtained by reducing
the m-kk-monopole along a transverse direction dierent from the taub-nut direction.
these branes are required by u-duality of m-theory on a d-torus (see for instance [13]).
