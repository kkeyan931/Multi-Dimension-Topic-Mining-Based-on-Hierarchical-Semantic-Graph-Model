abstract

the hamiltonian formulation of the supersymmetric closed 2-brane
dual to the double compactied d=11 closed supermembrane is pre-
sented. the formulation is in terms of two u (1) vector elds related
by the area preserving constraint of the susy 2-brane. stable solu-
tions of the eld equations, which are local minima of the hamiltonian,
are found. in the semiclassical approximation around the stable solu-
tions the action becomes the reduction of d=10 super-maxwell to the
worldvolume. the solutions carry rr charges as a type of magnetic
charges associated with the worldvolume vector eld. the geometrical
interpretation of the solution in terms of u (1) line bundles over the
worldvolume is obtained.

the interest in d=11 supermembranes [1] has been renewed by the re-
alization that 11-dimensional supergravity may describe the long distance
behaviour of m-theory [2, 3, 4, 5]. the spectrum of the supermembrane in
d=11 minkowski target space has been shown to be continuous when the
su(n) regularization is used [6]. the analysis of the spectrum in the case of
a compactied target space has not been completed. mean while, the search
for massless states, corresponding to the states of 11-dimensional supergra-
vity, still continues [3, 7].

in this work we analyze the closed d = 11 supermembrane in a tar-
get space m9xs 1xs 1 [8]. we consider the dual formulation in terms of two
vector elds. we perform the complete canonical analysis, determine its
physical hamiltonian and found its minimal congurations. we show that
the semiclassical approximation of the action around the minimal congura-
tions describes the reduction of d = 10 super-maxwell theory to the world
volume, showing that the congurations are stable ones. the minimal con-
gurations carry a type of magnetic charge that may be interpreted as a rr
charge which couples to the kaluza-klein vector eld.

the 2-brane action in the form which includes an independent auxiliary

metric may be expressed as,

s(, x) = 

1

2 z d3(cid:16)ijix jx   1(cid:17)

(1)

where i,j denote the world volume indices while ,  denote the 11 dimen-
sional indices. x  dene maps from the 3-dimensional world volume m3,
which will be assumed to be m3 = xr where  is a compact riemann
surface of genus g, to the 11-dimensional space-time which is assumed to
be m11qx[s 1]q where q is the number of compactied coordinates. each
compactied coordinates x is a map from xr to s 1. it then satises

dx = 2qc

ic

(2)

where c is a basis of homology of dimension 1 elements, while qc is an integral
number associated to each element of the basis. the set of qc for a basis of
homology denes the winding of the maps over s 1.

we will be interested in particular in the case q  2 where the situation

of irreducible winding may arise [8].

where r, s = 1, ..., q and m = 0, ..., (10  q). ar
k are q connection 1-forms
which locally ensure that lr
i satisfy the right constraints in order to recover
(1), where q  q, that is not all compactied directions need be dualized. to
implement the global condition (2) one has to impose the condition

f (ar) = 2pr

im2

(4)

where m2 is a basis of homology of dimension 2 and summation over all pr
must be performed [9]. the equivalence between formulation (1) and (3) is
ensured provided summation in all winding is consider in (1) and summation
in all pr is taken in (3) [9], [10]; although this is strictly true for a compact
euclidean world volume.

the geometrical interpretation of (4) is given by the weil theorem [11]
which ensures the existence of a u(1) principle bundle over m3 (compact,
euclidean) and a connection 1-form over it whose curvature is identical to
f (ar).

funtional integration over lr leads to the action

the action (5) for q = 1 and a gauge vector eld corresponding to a trivial
line bundle was rst obtained in [3] following previous work in [12] and [13].
in order to analyze (5), one has to distinguish the case of an open mem-
brane from the closed one. in the former, a solution to the eld equations
arises by considering the time and two spatial coordinates in the target space
to coincide with the local coordinates on the worldvolume. the semiclassi-
cal approximation of the action around this solution yields the reduction of
d=10 maxwell action to the worldvolume. the situation for the case of a
closed membrane is dierent. a solution where the time and two spatial coor-
dinates in the target space coincide with the coordinates on the worldvolume
requires three compactied dimensions of the target, two of them identi-
ed with the worldvolume spatial coordinates and the third one dualized
to achieve a closed membrane with a u(1) gauge vector. there is however

3

another interesting scenario, which will be the point to be analyzed in this
paper, where q = q = 2. we will show that there are stable solutions to the
eld equations arising from the sector of the two u(1) gauge vectors, and
not from the metric on the worldvolume. the solutions are characterized by
a quantized type of magnetic charge in distinction to the above discussed
solutions. furthermore the action around that solution corresponds to the
reduction of d = 10 super-maxwell to the worldvolume. it is interesting to
mention that in the case q = 0, 1 the solutions corresponding to the minima
of the hamiltonian are unstable.
it is required at least two compactied
directions, q = 2, in order to have stable solutions [8].

if the metric ij is eliminated by using perturbative eld equations, it
was shown in [3] for q = q = 1, that the born-infeld theory is obtained. see
also [14]

to obtain the hamiltonian version of the theory we consider, in the usual

way, the adm decomposition of the metric

ab = ab
 0a = n an 2
ab = ab  n an bn 2
 00 = n 2

where

and

a,b are the 2 spatial indices.

abbc = a
c

 = nq

the canonical action may then be rewritten as

where  is the determinant of the matrix ab. f rf r and rr are contracted
with the metric ab.

we now consider the ligth-cone gauge xing condition:

x + = p +
0 t

p + = p +

0 w

(12)

where t is the time coordinate on the world volume and w the determinant
of the metric over . some authors take w to be 1, however this condition
cannot be imposed globally over any compact riemann surface. the metric
over  only appears in the action through its determinant.

in the usual way one obtains

ax = ax m pm  b

a well dened solution for x. they are

where the rst class constraint (14) has been left as a restriction to the phase
space variables. its associated gauge symmetry has not been xed by the
lc gauge condition, as occurs in the canonical analysis for the membrane
theory. the rst class constraint generates the algebra of the area preserving
dieomorphisms in the extended phase space given by x, p and a, . the
matrix ab is an auxiliary variable satisfying (11)

any 2x2 invertible matrix ab satises

cdacbd = 1ab

consequently (11) may be simplify to

(17)

(18)

ab = (cid:16)1  1rr(cid:17)1(cid:16)ax m bxm  1rarb(cid:17)

that is ab may be expressed as a function of x m and ra only. we now
observe that the contraction

we will now study the local minimal congurations of the hamiltonian
(16). we will be in particular interested in the stable local minima. to deter-
mine such congurations we need to introduce a global geometric condition
in the phase space. the straightforward minima of the hamiltonian arise
over eld congurations which are innite dimensional and are unstable, i.e.
when a
r = 0 we have innite valleys congurations as in the case of the
supermembrane.

the minimal congurations are obtained for p and a satisfying

(26)

when the area of  is normalized to 2, the minimal conguration are ob-
tained for

where mr are integral numbers, characterizing the u(1) principle bundle
associated to each connection 1-forms ar

(18)

(35)

which may then be substituted into (18) to get explicit expressions for the
variations of . the terms linear in the variations are

we conclude then that (28), (29) is a stationary conguration of (22).

(44)

i.e. the minimal congurations are strict up to closed 1-forms. it is inter-
esting that the interpretation of ab as a 1-form connection may be extended
to consider b

rf r as its conjugate momenta.

(48)

this is, up to second order in the variations in the action, the gauss cons-
traint on the conjugate momentum to a.

the hamiltonian (16), in the semiclassical approximation, becomes then

we thus conclude that the hamiltonian, in the semiclassical approximation
around the minimal congurations we found, exactly describes the 10 di-
mensional maxwell theory dimensionally reduced to the world volume of the
2-brane. x m m = 1, ..., 7 represent the transverse coordinates to the 2-
brane, while ab and  b describe the maxwell theory over the world volume.
this eld content corresponds to a 2-dbrane in 10 dimensions [17], [18]. we
notice that in order to obtain this description the metric in the world volume
is however completely specied.
it is given by (50) in terms of the mini-
mal conguration. the metric (50) is precisely the canonical metric which
naturally appears associated to the monopole congurations [15]

this structure of the hamiltonian in the quadratic approximation ensure
that the local minima are stable solutions to the eld equations.
in dis-
tinction to the case n = 0, in which the minimal congurations expand an
innite dimensional subspace, as in the d=11 supermembrane theory over
minkowski space time.

following (40) we may introduce

and interpret (28) as

ab =

1
2

rb srs

 f = n

(52)

(53)

these solutions describe then monopole connections over the riemann
surface , generalizing the dirac monopole over s 2. the integer n in (53)
classies all non-trivial u(1) line bundles over . the general explicit expre-
ssion for the gauge vectors was obtained in [15] in terms of u(1) connections
1-forms with non-trivial transitions over . see also [16]. a subset of these
solutions are dual to the ones obtained in [8], the interpretation is now natural
in terms of the u(1) gauge vector eld, even when the global aspects of
dualization are strictly valid on compact worldvolumes.

the generalization of the above result to the super 2-brane in the semi-
classical aproximation arises in the same way. instead of (1), we may consider
the supermembrane action [1], and perform the double dualization procedure
as in the pure bosonic case.

the light cone gauge may be imposed by taking

x + = p +

p + = p +

the worldvolume canonical action arising from (55) may be analyzed as
in the bosonic case. the result is that the conguration (28) together with
 = 0, describe the minimal congurations of (55). the semiclassical ap-
proximation around that minima describe the d=10 maxwell supermultiplet
dimensionally reduced to three dimensions, in terms of x m , m = 1, ..., 7
scalar elds (the transverse coordinates to the world volume of the 2d-brane),
the world volume vector potential a and eight sl(2, r) spinors arising from
the majorana spinors  satisfying the lcg condition (54).
the main property of the above minimal congurations is that they des-
cribe isolated local minima (up to closed 1-forms over the riemann surface )
of the hamiltonian. that is, they are locally stable solutions. this property
distinguish the double compactied closed d=11 supermembrane from the
single compactied closed one as discussed in [8].

the results in this paper extend then the construction obtained in [8] for
the bosonic membrane to the supermembrane case. the interpretation of
the solution in terms of the u(1) vector eld of the 2d-brane becomes then
natural. in fact, the solution carry a type of magnetic charge given by

q = z f = z d2w .f = v ol.n

(58)

the topological coupling of the u(1) vector eld on the worldvolume to the
rr 1-form connection b of the iia superstring is naturally given by

zm3=xr f  b

11

(59)

we may then interpret q as the rr charge carried by the closed 2d-brane.
in [3] it was argued how a classical closed membrane conguration could
be identied with a 0-brane which is needed to describe the dynamics of the
centre of mass motion of the supermembrane. moreover, it was argued that
a closed membrane may carry the 0-brane rr charge as a type of magnetic
charge associated with its world volume vector eld, and that its centre
of mass motion should be described by the 0-brane u(1) supersymmetric
quantum gauge mechanics. this was interpreted as an evidence that the
0-brane is included in the supermembrane spectrum and hence that massless
states are included in it.

one further requirement should be added to the argument in [3]. the
solutions carrying the charge q should be stable solutions of the membrane
eld equations. the solutions we found have precisely the required stability
property.

we have thus, constructed the physical hamiltonian of the supersymme-
tric closed 2-brane dual to the double compactied d=11 closed supermem-
brane with target space m9xs 1xs 1. the formulation is originally in terms
of two u(1) gauge elds over the worldvolume, related by the area preser-
ving constraint. the target space being m9. we found the stable minimal
congurations of the hamiltonian and showed that the semiclassical approxi-
mation of the action around those minimal congurations correspond to the
reduction of 10 dimensional super maxwell to the worldvolume of the 2-
brane. in that approximation, the original formulation in terms of two gauge
eld is equivalent to a theory in terms of only one u(1) maxwell potential,
the area preserving constraint being the gauss constraint for it.

the minimal congurations are classied by three integer mr, r = 1, 2,
and n. the integer n was interpreted as a rr charge carried by the 2-brane
and corresponds geometrically to the integral number classifying the principle
bundles over which the u(1) maxwell connection is dened. when mr = 0,
r = 1, 2, we then have from (13) and (29)

a x = 0,

a x m = 0

(60)

that is, there is a solutions x = 0, x m = 0. this solution may be in-
terpreted as a massless 0-brane moving in the light cone of m9 carrying a
quantized rr charge. when m r 6= 0, it follows from (13) that x is pro-
portional to mr r. the target space time coordinate x 0 becomes then a
multivalued function over the worldvolume.
