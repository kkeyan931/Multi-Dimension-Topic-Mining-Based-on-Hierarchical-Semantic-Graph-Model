abstract

explicit relations among moduli of the heterotic and type iib string theories in 8 dimensions
are obtained. we identify the bps states responsible for gauge enhancements in the type iib
theory and their dual partners in the heterotic theory compactied with and without wilson
lines. the masses of bps states in type iib string theory compactied on the base space
of a elliptically bred k3 are computed explicitly for the special cases in which the complex
structure of the bre is constant, ie, for constant scalar elds backgrounds.

1 introduction

over the past couple of years non-perturbative aspects of compactications of type iib theory have
been studied rst in terms of f-theory [1] compactications and later in an explicitly stringy form

by means of including non-perturbative (p, q) 7-brane congurations in the background. the former
has been particularly important in the analysis of the duality with the heterotic string.

compactications of f-theory on elliptic calabi-yau two-folds (k3), three-folds and four-folds
have been argued to be dual to certain compactications of the heterotic string to 8, 6 and 4
dimensions. the simplest case to consider is the compactications of f-theory to 8 dimensions on
an elliptic k3. this theory is believed to be dual to the heterotic string on t 2. the ade pattern
of gauge symmetry enhancement in the heterotic string [3, 4] is reproduced in f-theory by the

pattern of collapsible holomorphic two spheres in k3 [2]. the location in the moduli space where the
symmetries occur are provided by the zeros of the discriminant of the k3 surface. this establishes

the duality at a geometrical level.

the other approach that has emerged [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] is type iib theory compactied
on a sphere in the presence of non-local 7-branes which extend in the uncompactied directions and

2

appear as singular points on the sphere. the presence of the ade series of algebras arising on 7-
branes congurations were explored in refs[7, 8, 9, 10, 11] where it was shown how (p, q)-strings and

string junctions stretched between the 7-branes correspond to vector bosons of the eight dimensional
gauge theory. other algebras organised in terms of the conjugacy classes of sl(2, z) have been

identied in terms of the strings and junctions connecting the 7-branes [12, 13, 14]. some connections
among elements in the type iib theory and their duals in the heterotic theory in 8 dimensions have
appeared in the literature[15]. however all identications have been at a qualitative level, in the

sense that the masses of the gauge bosons that are supposed to become massless at specic points
in the moduli space to generate the relevant gauge group had not been checked explicitly. we will

compute explicitly the masses of the relevant gauge bosons in many examples in this paper.

the masses of bps (p, q)-strings have been computed explicitly in two cases. the rst was the

work of sen [6] who used the results of seiberg-witten for n = 2 supersymmetric su(2) gauge theory
with 4 quark avours. he computed the masses of bps states in the limit where the 24 7-branes
are grouped into four groups of 8 branes yielding an so(8)4 symmetry. in [19] sen introduced a
new mass formula which showed how the masses above originated from the mass formula of open
strings stretched between 7-branes. later, lerche and stieberger [16] suggested a generalisation of

the formula used by sen in terms of a contribution by the fundamental period of the implicit f-
theory k3. they argued that this factor would not have any eect in the rigid limit considered by

sen but would provide the correct normalisation in the general case. the masses of the bps gauge
elds responsible for the geometrical enhancement of u(1)2
g  su(3)g were computed and an exact
match with the heterotic string mass formula was obtained. however, only one example and with
no wilson lines was considered.

in this paper we use the mass formula of ref[16] to compute the mass of various gauge bosons

potentially responsible for several gauge enhancements in the type iib side. this takes the description
of non perturbative type iib theory to a more quantitative level. we also compare the masses of

the bps gauge bosons in type iib with their heterotic dual partners and nd complete agreement.
we analyse examples with both zero and non zero wilson lines. the explicit map of the geometrical

and wilson lines moduli in the heterotic theory to the moduli describing the position of the 7-branes
in the sphere is obtained in several examples.

we focus on the branches of moduli space where the massless scalar elds in type iib are
constant. there are three such branches in the moduli space [6, 22]. we refer to them as branches 0,
i and ii. branch 0 exist for any constant value of the scalar elds and allow for only one symmetry

3

group, namely, so(8)4. branches i and ii require special values for the scalar elds and allow for a
more complex set of gauge symmetries. the moduli space of these branches have dimensions 1, 5,

and 8, respectively. we will consider, in particular, one-parameter families of curves living in their
multidimensional moduli spaces. once we dene a one-parameter family in one of the branches of

type iib by choosing a pattern of gauge enhancement we compute the mass of the bps gauge bosons
responsible for the symmetries. the next step is to determine the dual family in the heterotic theory
that must have not only the same pattern of gauge enhancements but also the masses of the bps

gauge bosons must match everywhere in the moduli space (see fig 1). this procedure is carried out
for a number of examples and the explicit duality maps between the dual families are obtained.

the gauge group, gi, enhancement pattern must agree as well as the mass of the bps states.

this paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we review results for the heterotic theory com-
pactied on t 2. we also obtain an expression for masses of bps states in the presence of general
wilson lines that generalises the standard holomorphic expression in terms of the kahler structure,
t , and complex structure, u, of the torus. this expression will play a fundamental role in estab-

lishing the duality map in section 4. in section 3 we review the basics of type iib compactications
on the sphere in the presence of 7-branes in order to establish our conventions.
in section 4 we

compute the masses of a number of bps states in the two branches of constant  on the type iib
side and compare with the masses of the heterotic theory duals obtained in section 2. explicit maps
between the heterotic and type iib moduli are derived. in section 5 we present our conclusions.

in appendix a we show how to generalise some hypergeometric relations used in the paper. and
nally, in appendix b we obtain the explicit relation among certain moduli in the heterotic theory

that are required elsewhere in the paper.

2 heterotic string on t 2

consider the heterotic string compactied on a torus, t 2, down to 8 dimensions along directions
x8 and x9. in this section it will not be necessary to specify which heterotic theory we are working
with.

the expression for the left and right moving momenta with wilson lines is given by

(pri|pli) = (pi  (gij  bij)

wj
 |pi + (gij + bij)

wj


; s 2



q)

(2.1)

where mi and wi are the kk momentum and winding numbers, respectively, along x8 and x9. we
dene pi = mi  1
q = q + wkak.

2ai  (akwk)  ai  q, q is an element of either of the lattices 16 or 8l 8 and

the mass spectrum is given by

m 2

h =

p 2
l
2

p 2
r
2

(nr  cr)
where nl, nr are the left-, right-moving oscillator numbers, and cr = 0, 1
2 depending on whether the
right-moving fermions are periodic (r) or anti-periodic (ns). we must impose the level matching

(2.3)

bps states are given by the additional requirement that nr = cr [18]. therefore for states that are
physical and bps saturated we must have

or

r =

(summation convention). in this case we can write for the mass formula

m 2

h = prigijprj

= (pi  (gil  bil)

wl


)gij(pj  (gjk  bjk)

wk


).

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

the massless states with nl = 1 include the 8-dimensional metric, antisymmetric tensor, dilaton
and gauge elds which are the cartan generators of the gauge group. we also have two scalars in

5

the adjoint of the gauge group which are the wilson lines. in the nl = 0 sector we have massless
gauge elds associated to the roots of the underlying gauge group. they must satisfy

p 2

r = 0
4
 

l =

p 2

1
2

q2 + miwi = 1.

(2.7)

the zero winding numbers sector gives the roots of the subgroup of e8  e8 or so(32) which is
left unbroken by the wilson lines. further gauge elds will appear in the non-zero winding numbers
sector for special values of the geometrical moduli of the torus, ie, gij and bij. we discuss these
cases in more detail in later sections.

one of the goals of this paper is to use the duality between the heterotic strings on t 2 and type
iib compactied on the base space of a elliptic bred k3. when comparing heterotic string states
with the dual states in type iib it turns out to be extremely convenient to rewrite the heterotic

mass formula in a holomorphic or anti-holomorphic form. to do so we introduce the parameters

u = u1 + iu2 =

where g = g88g99  g2
89 and b = b89. t 0 is the kahler structure and u the complex structure of the
torus. when dealing with wilson lines it becomes very convenient to introduce a modied version
of the kahler structure. in the presence of wilson lines we redene 2

note that t  t 0 and z  0 as we turn o the wilson lines. the mass formula, eq(2.6), becomes,
in terms of the new variables,

2 u 0

2 |n8  un9 + t w9 + (t u + z)w8|

(2.13)

2a similar expression has been considered in compactications of the heterotic string on zn orbifolds [23]. however,

only for the case of very specic wilson lines.

6

note that this expression for the mass of bps states is valid for any wilson line. this mass formula
turns out to be a very useful way of rewriting the standard expression, eq(2.6), for compactications
of the heterotic string on t 2, particularly when there are wilson lines. it will play a major role in
what follows.

3 type iib on s2
s

let us consider type iib theory compactied on a two-sphere, s2, in the presence of 24 parallel
7-branes which appear as points on s2. we refer to this punctured sphere as, s2
s . the theory
possesses dierent strings labelled (p, q) according to how it is charged with respect to the rr and
nsns antisymmetric elds. the 7-branes of the theory are also labelled (p, q), according to what
(p, q)-string can end on it.

in this convention the elementary string is (1, 0) and a d-string is (0, 1). each of the 24 7-branes
has an associated branch cut depending on its type. we follow the conventions of [9]. we use
three basic types of branes, a, b and c, whose corresponding (p, q) labels are (1, 0), (1,1) and
(1, 1) respectively. across the corresponding cuts the labels (p, q) and u change according to the

monodromy matrices

1 ! ,
a = (1, 0) : ka = t 1 =   1 1
2 ! ,
b = (1,1) : kb = st 2 =   0 1
0 ! ,
c = (1, 1) : kc = t 2s =   2 1

where s is the matrix

s =   0 1

(3.1)

(3.2)

all branes have their branch cut going upwards vertically. a-branes are represented by heavy

dots, b-branes by empty boxes and c-branes by empty circles (see fig. 1).

a formula for the mass of (p, q)-strings in the background described above has been derived by

sen [6, 19] and is given by

miib(p, q) =zc |( (z))2

(z  zi)1/12(p + q (z)) dz| .

all branch cuts are chosen to go upward.

for more general backgrounds there has been a suggestion [16] that this mass formula should be

generalised in order to include additional f-theory data. specically, the authors of ref[16] suggested
that the mass formula should include the fundamental period of k3, 0, so that the mass formula
becomes

note that  = 4f 3 + 27g2 is the discriminant of the elliptic bre, dened from the polynomial
equation, w (x, y, ) = y2  x3  f ()x  g() = 0, dening the elliptic k3 surface. the zis are the
positions of the 24 branes on the sphere, s2

we see that there are three branches of constant  [6, 22]. we have constant  if f 3 = g2, f =

we can factorise the data in the periods of k3 in a part depending on the elliptic bre from that
depending on the base only. we summarise the results in table 1.

for the three branches of constant  we have an expression for the periods of k3 in terms of
the discriminant, , which is similar to the one we have in the numerator of the the mass formula

for (p, q)-strings. actually, the only subtle point in these expressions in this case are the limits of
integration in the periods. in fact, we can write for constant

in the next section we compute the masses of bps gauge elds and study how they map under
the heterotic and type iib theories duality in the branches i and ii. the branch where f 3 = g2
only has so(8)4 symmetry and we will not consider it in this paper.

4 the duality map

in this section we will consider the masses of bps states in type iib theory in two branches of

constant  , namely, branch i and ii. and then we identify the dual bps states in the heterotic
string and compare their masses. this will allow us to identify explicitly the duality map for some
moduli of the two theories.

4.1 branch i -  = ei/3

in branch i, f = 0 & g 6= 0   = e
in 12 non local pairs of branes. the two branes forming each pair can only move together. we will

3 , there are only 9 degrees of freedom. the 24 branes join up

i

9

refer to them as a dynamical unit. each dynamical unit is formed by an ac pair. their positions on
s2
s are related though. in fact, since the zeros of the discriminant indicate the position of the branes
on s2
s and g() is a polynomial of degree 12, we have  = 27g2 = 0. this equation has 12 degrees of
freedom. moding out by sl(2, c) eliminates another 3 complex degrees of freedom giving relations

among the position of the branes on the sphere.

these singularities can collide and yield a gauge enhancement at the points where the discriminant
of k3 vanishes. the pattern of gauge enhancement in each of the branches of constant  in type

iib has been studied in detail in ref[8]. the basic gauge enhancements that appear when  = e
due to dynamical units colliding at the same point is given by

i
3

u(1)2  su(3); u(1)3  so(8); u(1)4  e6; u(1)5  e8.

(4.1)

in ref[8] the authors qualitatively identied the gauge elds responsible for the symmetries above.

in ref[11] a systematic procedure based in string junctions was developed giving further evidence for
the identication of these gauge elds. however no explicit check of the mass for this gauge elds and

its relation to the heterotic duals has been obtained until recently. in [16] (see also [20, 21]) the masses
of the gauge elds responsible for the enhancement of e8  e8  u(1)g  u(1)g  e8  e8  su(3)g
were computed. they were shown to be identical to the mass of the heterotic duals.

the mass for bps (p, q)-strings in this branch is given by

miib(p, q) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(p +  q)(ei/3)2

.

(4.2)

we now compute the mass of bps gauge elds in both the heterotic and type iib theories. we
start by reviewing the results of ref[16]. we will then turn on wilson lines and analyse how it eects

the mass for the bps gauge bosons.

g  e8  e8  su(3)g

a) the case with no wilson lines: e8  e8  u(1)2
the duality between the heterotic string and f-theory can take two forms. starting from the e8e8
theory we have to go through m-theory by means of a 9  11-ip from the heterotic on t 2 to type
ia on s1 s1/z2 and then by t-duality to type iib on t 2/z2 which in turn is the same as the weak
coupling limit of f-theory on k3. for the spin(32)/z2 heterotic theory on t 2 we start by s-duality
to type i and them by two t-dualities to type iib on t 2/z2 and subsequently to f-theory on k3.
the gauge elds we are considering in this sub-section are not charged under the cartan of either

10

e8  e8 or so(32). therefore, it does not matter which theory we start from since the mass is the
same for the su(3) gauge bosons. the authors in ref[16] considered the e8  e8 heterotic string
since in this case the e8  e8 is obtained without any wilson line.

let us consider the e8  e8 heterotic string compactied on a torus down to 8 dimensions as in
section 1. we turn o all wilson lines such that the moduli that specify the torus can be combined
into two complex scalars

therefore, we are at the well know point of gauge enhancement of two geometrical u(1)gs to su(3)g.
we need six gauge elds to realise this enhancement. the gauge elds in the heterotic string together
with their quantum numbers are given in table 2. note that all states in table 2 satisfy the level
matching condition, eq(4.4).

having xed the value for the quantum numbers identifying the gauge bosons we can rewrite the

formula for their mass, (4.3), as in table 3.

furthermore, using the fact that for u = ei/3 we have u = ei/3 = ei i

3 = e2i/3 = u 2
and u 2  u + 1 = 0. we can rewrite the numerators and denominators in the expressions in table
3 as follows

|1 + t (u  1)| = |(1  u)(t  u)|
|1 + u(t  1)| = |u(t  u)|
|1 + t u + t| = |u 4(u 2 + t )|

|t  u| = |t + u 2|

|1 + u( t  1)| = |u 2(u 2 + t )|

with this result we can write the mass of the 6 su(3) gauge elds as in table 4. all six gauge elds
become massless as t 0  u.

in f-theory the k3 surface we are looking for is the one that has the gauge group e8 e8 u(1)2
and such that it depends on only one moduli to have it enhanced to su(3). such a surface is given

this surface describes a bred k3 and the bre has the discriminant given by

= 27g2
= 27z10(z  1)2(z  zs)2

(4.6)

(4.7)

the points where the discriminant vanishes give the position of 7-branes on s2
s . for this particular
expression the gauge group is given by a bre ii[2] at 0 and (this point will appear in another
patch of s2
s ). and bre ii at 1 and zs yielding e8e8u(1)2 symmetry, respectively. the important
point about this k3 is that it depends only on one complex parameter, namely, zs. the point of
enhancement to su(3) is when we have zs  1 therefore the distance zs  1 must be related to the
expression t 0  u in the heterotic side.

in the equivalent type iib picture we want to compute explicitly the mass for a (p, q)-string
stretching between the two points of u(1) gauge symmetry, ie, 1 and zs (see fig 2). first a simple
analysis of the moduli tells us that there are 6 strings that can end on the non-local branes sitting
at that points. in our conventions these strings are, up to global sl(2, z) monodromies, v1,2 =
(1, 0), v3,4 = (1, 1) & v5,6 = (0, 1). this xes the tension in the mass formula. the integral
in the numerator of the mass formula can be rewritten in terms of hypergeometric functions after a
simple change of variables. we obtain

represents one dynamical unit, ac.

the periods of k3, using eq(3.6), are also expressible in terms of hypergeometric functions. in

fact,

through a non-trivial hypergeometric transformation we can rewrite l in terms of the periods

wi as follows

[5/3][1/6]

l = 

[4/3]
= ei/3w0 + w1

(e2i/3w0 + w1)

(4.11)

following [16] we divide the original expression for the mass, eq(3.3), by the fundamental period w0
and use the at coordinate for k3, tiib = w1/w0. the result is

miib(p, q) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
= (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

in fig 3 we represent the conguration we will consider in this subsection from the type iib per-
spective. we break one of the e8s by moving away an integer number of dynamical units. it is not
necessary to specify in detail what the breaking is at innity. the elliptic k3 surface equivalent to
this conguration in type iib is given by

y2 + x3 + z5(z  1)(z  zs)(z  m)n = 0.

we have put ve dynamical units at z = 0 forming a e8, one dynamical units at z = zs and another
one at z = 1 forming u(1)2

moved away from innity.

where cl(n) are some numerical coecients. we also obtain similar expressions for the periods. the
point is that we can now rewrite the integrand in terms of hypergeometric functions and apply one

of kummers relations to each element in the sum separately as we show in appendix a. it turns out
that we end up with the following relation among l and the periods

l = w0  w1.

(4.20)

dividing by w0 we obtain for the mass formula of bps states stretching between the 7 branes sitting

where we introduced once again tiib. note that tiib incorporates all the information on the positions
of the branes as we move them around very much as th does with wilson lines. we start now to
explore how they are connected.

turning on wilson line moduli. the moduli now becomes

)

(4.22)

let us assume further that the geometrical moduli remain xed to their values as in eq(4.5). the

bps mass for the su(3)g states is now given by

mh =

1
2 u2|m8  um9 + t w9 + (t u + z)w8|
2t 0

(4.23)

let us analyse what are the conditions for the su(3)g gauge bosons to become massless again.

we surely expect this to be smoothly related to the wilson lines parameters. in fact, we have

i) for v1,2:

we have for the mass of this states

w8 = 0, m8 = 0, m9 = w9.

mh =

1
2 u2|m9(u  t )|.
2t 0

(4.24)

(4.25)

level matching condition, eq(2.7), implies that m9w9 = 1, ie w9 = 1 = m9, and this will determine,
as before, the p charge of the (p, q)-string in type iib. note that t depends on the wilson line
parameter now. so to obtain a massless state we must have, t  u, or from eq(4.22)

ii) for v3,4

we obtain for the mass

a9  a9 = 0  a9 = 0
a9  a8 = 0.

m8 = w8 = w9, m9 = 0

mh

=

2 u2|w8||z|  z = 0.
2t 0

(4.26)

(4.27)

(4.28)

note again that level matching requires w8 = 1 = m8  w9 = 1. lets analyse the condition on
z. using u = e

in eq(2.11) we obtain

i
3

z =

1
4

(a9  a9 + 2a9  a8  2a8  a8) + i

2

(a9  a8 

a9  a9

2

) = 0.

(4.29)

17

the imaginary part is equal to zero due to eq(4.26). for the real part we have

a8  a8 = 0  a8 = 0.

(4.30)

these states become massless only when we turn o the wilson lines, ai = 0, as expected. since in

this case we are back to the situation of [16] with the geometrical parameters xed to their critical
values. and finally

iii) for v5,6:

w9 = 0, w8 = m8 = m9

level matching requires w8 = 1 = m8 = m9. their mass is given by
1
2 u2|w8(1  u + t u  z)|
2t 0
1
2 u2|w8||z| = 0.
2t 0

mh = t =u

=

(4.31)

(4.32)

so for the geometrical parameters xed to their critical values, b = 1, r2

c = g22 = g11 = 2 and
g12 = 1, we see, by comparing eq(4.22) with eq(4.26), eq(4.29) and eq(4.33), that the relative separa-
tion parameter of the two dynamical units on type iib responsible for the geometrical enhancement
is mapped to the wilson line moduli by

uh  
th  tiib.

(4.33)

if we now consider the more general case when we allow for the geometrical parameters to be

dierent from their critical values the six gauge bosons will become massless again when

(4.34)

if we were to turn on a wilson line and still keep the su(3)g symmetry we would have to tune the
geometrical parameters such that the critical values would be shifted as follows

a9  a9

2

(4.35)

(4.36)

b = 1 + a9  a8

c = 2

note that the constraints in z, eq(4.28), would still be in place but now in the more general form

a9  a9
a9  a8 =
a9  a9 = a8  a8.

2

(4.37)

we have shown that by introducing the parameters u and t as in eq(2.10) and by writing the
heterotic mass formula as in eq(2.13) the map between heterotic string bps states and their duals

in type iib theory are immediately obtained, eq(4.33). in the next section we extend this analysis
to the other non-trivial branch of constant coupling in type iib theory.

4.2 branch ii -  = i

for branch ii, f 6= 0 & g = 0   = i, and there are 5 complex degrees of freedom. in fact,
f () is a polynomial of degree 8 and we have to mod out the sl(2, c) symmetry. the 24 branes

join up forming 8 groups with two mutually local branes and a non-local one. in our conventions
a dynamical unit is (aac). in general, we have su(2)8 gauge group. the other possible gauge
groups are

e7  su(2)5

e7  e7  su(2)2
su(2)8
so(8)  su(2)6 e7  so(8)  su(2)3 e7  e7  so(8)
so(8)2  su(2)4 e7  so(8)2  su(2)
so(8)3  su(2)2
so(8)4

therefore, we see that in branch ii we have two basic gauge enhancements depending on how

many dynamical units collide at the same point. we have

(su(2)  u(1))2  so(8); & (su(2)  u(1))3  e7

;

the mass for bps (p, q)-strings in this branch is given by

miib(p, q) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(i)2

a(i)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

r dz|(z)(1/12)|
|r0 dz(z)(1/12)|

19

(4.38)

(4.39)

let us consider the map of iib theory in branch ii to the spin(32)/z2 heterotic string on t 2.

it is convenient to start with the following wilson lines:

w8 = (

4

;

1
2

w9 = (04;

; 02; 02; 04)

4

1
2
4
1
2

; 02; 02;

4

1
2

).

(4.40)

these wilson lines break the gauge group to so(8)4. the semicolon separation will become clear
below.

as part of our duality map we set as before

in the heterotic side this implies that

uh  .

uh =

g89
g99

+ i

g
g99

=  = i.

(4.41)

(4.42)

this xes two of the geometrical moduli, namely, g89 = 0 and g88 = g99 = r2. this is why in our
redenition of the geometrical parameters in heterotic string with wilson lines we left uh unchanged
so that this mapping remains the same.

we analyse the map between the heterotic and type iib theories in two examples. both examples

correspond to a one-parameter family in the respective moduli spaces.

once we dene a one-parameter family in the heterotic theory we present a one-parameter family
in the type iib theory that we argue is the dual family. there is, obviously, an innity number

of one-parameter families in a 5 dimensional space as the moduli space we are dealing with here.
nevertheless, we manage to identify one potential family in the type iib theory. the condition for
this family to be the dual family of the one in the heterotic theory is that they both have the same

pattern of gauge enhancements taking place in dual points in the moduli spaces. and the fact that
the mass of bps gauge bosons are the same every where in moduli space. we verify this to be the

case in both examples we consider. we then write explicitly the duality map between the moduli of
the two theories.

we start with the enhancement:

20

a) (su(2)  u(1))2  so(8)3  e2
to achieve this enhancement we have to move in the wilson lines moduli space by adding to the
wilson lines above the following pieces

7  so(8)

a8 = w8 + (04; 04; a2, 02; 04)

a9 = w9 + (04; 04; 02, a2; 04),

(4.43)

where a is a real positive parameter. it is immediate to see that the eect of the perturbation is
to break the third so(8)(3), ie, the one occupying the third block of four slots in the lattice vector
above, to (su(2)  u(1))(1)  (su(2)  u(1))(2). we anticipate the map with type iib by picturing
this breaking in fig 4.

note that for a = 1

so(4)(2) since the following vectors become massless (we will concentrate on one of the enhancements
to e7 only since the process is identical for both)

these gauge bosons enhance (so(4)(1)so(8)(1))  so(12)(1). analogously, we also have (so(4)(2)
so(8)(4))  so(12)(2). the mass of this states as they approach a = 1

2 are listed in table 5.

if this model is to represent a conguration of branes in type iib in branch ii there can not be

a so(12). but we are not nished yet. we have to check the states with winding numbers.

if we rewrite the expression for the heterotic momenta using uh = i we can write for the mass6,

eq(2.6),

h = p 2

ir = (p8  (g88w8  bw9)

1


)2g88 + (p9  (g99w9 + bw8)

and using g88 = g99/g = 1/g88 = r2 = g99 we write

m 2

h = p 2

ir = (p8  (r2w8  bw9)

substituting this in the formula for level matching condition for gauge bosons, p 2

l = 4/, we

obtain

r2((w8)2 + (w9)2) = (1 

q2

)

(4.50)

this equation requires that we have q2  2. dening  = q + ,   16 such that 2 is smallest.
we obtain

r2((w8)2 + (w9)2) = (1

(4.51)

we separate the winding states in odd and even values for the sake of the analysis. furthermore,
it is easy to see that for odd winding numbers only wi = 1 contribute with massless states. for
w9 = 1 and w8 = 0 we obtain q = q  (04; 1

these are the spinors 321 of so(12)(1). the subscript is the u(1)w9 charge associated to winding
along x9-direction. this gauge vectors become massless at the critical radius r2
4 . it turns out
that it is convenient to write the spinors in terms of the gauge groups so(8)(1)  (su(2)  u(1))(1),
+ (8c; 1; 2; 1; 1). for even winding numbers, only wi = 2 contribute.
ie, 321 = (8s; 1; 1; 1; 1)
in this case we take q = (04; (1)4; 02; (1)6) and 2 = 0, these are singlets, (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)2. these
singlets become massless at the same radius as the spinors. so for r2
4 the spinors and singlets
enhance so(12)(1)  u(1)w9 to e(1)
7 . analogously, gauge elds with quantum numbers w9 = 0 and
w8 = 1,2 enhance so(12)(2)  u(1)w8 to e(2)
7 .

note that from eq(4.48) when w8 = 0 and w9 = 1,2, as above, we have a constraint in the
value of the anti-symmetric eld b. a straight forward analysis8 of that equation shows that we
must have b  2z (this only xes b up to an sl(2, z) transformation). therefore, we choose b = 0.
this xes the real part in the mass formula, eq(2.13), as in table 5.

c = 

consider now the other two free moduli. we have the wilson line parameter, a, and the radius,
r2 = g88 = g99. as mentioned before, we will consider only one-parameter families. so we have to
x one of this parameters. we know that when we are at the critical radius as a  1/2 we obtain
the enhancements described above. therefore, we choose the radius to be a function of a so that at
a = 1/2 we have r2 = r2
c = /4. of course there are an innity number of ways of achieving this
but ultimately we want a match between the masses of bps states in the dual theories. the analysis
carried out in appendix b determines that we set for the specic choice of parameters in the type
iib side to discussed below

r2 = (a(1  a)  (

1
2  a)).

(4.54)

it is now possible to write the mass formula for all the bps states we have been considering in

this section. we write their mass in terms of the mass formula, eq(2.13). the results are summarised
in table 5.

type iib duals

in type iib theory starting from an so(8)4 conguration we move the two dynamical units
forming one of the so(8)s in perpendicular directions toward two so(8)s (see fig. 4). as each

8in appendix b we present some details.

of the dynamical units approach one of the so(8)s a number of (p, q)-strings will become massless.
we identify this strings by their symmetry properties and compute their mass near the point they

become massless.

for the su(2)  u(1) in type iib we have aac = baa. the two vectors in the adjoint of
su(2) correspond to the a  a (1, 0)-string with both orientations. the enhancement to so(4)
occurs when strings (prongs) like the ones in fig. 6 become massless. they are equivalent to the
vectors q(1) = (04; 04; +1, +1; 02; 04). the  correspond to orientation.

figure 8: for q(2)
b

. two equivalent congurations are shown.

for the spinors we identify qa = (8c; 1; 2; 1; 1) with the congurations exemplied in fig 8. and

qb = (8c; 1; 2; 1; 1) is identied with fig 9.

we now compute the mass for each of this congurations. the k3 surface equivalent to the

conguration of branes in fig. 4 is given by

k3 :

y2 + x3 + x(z2(z  1)2(z  zs))

in the next sub-section we consider the vector bosons responsible for the enhancement of su(2)

u(1)  so(8).

b) so(8)  su(2)  u(1)
in the previous section we identied the (p, q)-strings congurations that are responsible for the
enhancement to e7. to complete the symmetry enhancements possible in the this branch we here
consider the enhancement (su(2) u(1))2  so(8). we choose, for convenience, to do this through
e2
7  (su(2)  u(1))  (su(2)  u(1))  e2
7  so(8) (see fig. 10). we choose to put one of the
e7s at z =  and the other one at z = 0. we also put one of the su(2)  u(1) at z = 1 and the
other at z = zs.

therefore we have for the mass of bps (p, q)-strings in this background

in the heterotic side we have the vectors below becoming massless to form the adj of so(8). in

the respective gures we draw the (p, q)-strings we identify as the dual pairs in the iib side.

q(1) = (04, +1, +1, 02; 08) or  (04; 02; +1, +1; 08)  fig. 12
q(2) = (04;1, 0; +1, 0; 08)  fig. 13

states was given in detail in the branches of moduli space of type iib with constant coupling.

in type iib the at coordinate, tiib = w0/w1, dened in terms of the periods of the underlying
k3 geometry encompasses all the information on the position of the 7-branes in the background

when the elliptic bre has constant complex structure. it is therefore the natural coordinate to be
used when analysing the map with wilson lines on the heterotic string side. in fact, redening the
kahler structure of the torus, th, in the heterotic theory to include information on the wilson lines.
we have found that it becomes the natural coordinate to account for the eects of wilson lines to

the mass of bps states.

for the the case of the spin(32)/z2 heterotic string the masses of bps states for specic values
of the wilson lines were analysed in detail. in particular, we considered the enhancements: so(8)
su(2) u(1) u(1)g  e7 and (su(2) u(1))2  so(8). in both cases we identied the dual bps

30

string junctions responsible for the enhancement on the type iib side and computed their masses
nding complete agreement between the two sets of states.

it would be interesting to consider the case with non constant coupling in type iib. work in this

direction is under way.

a generalising the hypergeometric relation among l, w0

and w1.

several times in this paper we had to rewrite the distance l in terms of the periods of k3.
in
most cases when we have only four groups of dynamical branes in s2
s we can rewrite the integrals in
terms of hypergeometric functions. it turns out then that the integrals in this form are related by

means of the kummers relations[25]. however, when the blocks break apart and we have more then
four points in the sphere we cannot write then as hypergeometric functions anymore. nevertheless,

we show that by taylor expanding the integrand we can write the integrals as a sum of integrals
that in turn can be related to hypergeometric functions. we can then apply kummers relations to
each element of the sum in separate and sum up the series again to obtain the relation we look for.

this generalises the hypergeometric relations to a more general set of integrals. in this appendix we
present the details of this calculations for the conguration considered in section 4.1.

we start with the length of the string stretched from z = 1 and z = zs

(z  m) n

where cl(n) are standard numerical coecients. if we now plug this back in eq(a.1) we have

we can write each element in the series representation of l in terms of the respective elements in the
series representation of w0 and w1. plugging this result back in the sum, eq(a.4), and reexpressing
the sum in its closed form, we arrive at the desired relation among l and w0 and w1, ie,

l =  w0  w1.

(a.7)

it is clear that this procedure can be applied to any distribution of the dynamical units on the

sphere by taylor expanding an appropriate number of terms in the expression for l, w0 and w1.

b fixing moduli in branch ii

in section 4.2 the rst example of gauge enhancement in branch ii to be analysed was so(8)3 
(su(2) u(1))2  e2
7  so(8). to obtain this enhancement the following wilson lines were turned
on

with a = 0 and a = 1/2 being the critical values for the wilson lines parameter. this was enough to
determine the masses of bps gauge bosons transforming in the vector and adjoint representations
of the gauge groups. with this information we xed part of the map with the bps states on the

type iib theory. we saw also that to obtain the full gauge enhancement we needed bps states
transforming in the spinor and singlet representations of the gauge groups. however, for these states

to become massless we need to tune not only the parameter in the wilson lines but the geometric
moduli as well. we want to determine the value of the geometric moduli, r and b, such that the

masses of the bps states responsible for the enhancement above match with those in type iib. we
will concentrate in three specic examples of gauge elds here. the quantum numbers of these states

will be given explicitly. the results easily generalise to all other states.

we will concentrate on the spinor with quantum numbers w9 = +1 and w8 = 0. and the singlet
with quantum numbers, w9 = +2 and w8 = 0. the other quantum numbers will be determined
below.

recall that the critical radius was, eq(4.53), determined in terms of 9

as r2
c/2 = 1  2/2 = a(1  a). was the radius to be set in this form we would have the spinors
and singlets all massless for all values of a. however this would generate enhancements that have no
equivalent in branch ii on type iib. but we know that when a = 1/2 we must have the appropriate
enhancement. one way to guarantee that this is the case is to set r2/2 = 1/4. but it turns out that
this choice does not give the right expression for the masses of the spinor and singlets. this means

we would be specifying a one-parameter family with the right gauge enhancements but not the dual

9in this section 

h = 2.

33

family of the bps states we identied on type iib. the masses of bps states on both sides must
match as well as the gauge enhancement pattern.

to obtain the correct bps masses in the heterotic theory we impose the condition that it matches

the ones on type iib. this will x r and b.

the analysis naturally separate in two parts. the real part of the mass formula depends on b
and a only. the constraint described above will x b in terms of a. the imaginary part depends on
the radius, r, and a only. the match with the mass formulas on type iib xes the relation between

the two moduli. the imaginary part is given by

im(mh) = m9  a9  q  w9(

r2
2

+ (1 + a2)).

where we used

im(t ) =

for the real part we obtain

where

re(mh) = m8  a8  q + w9(

now we require that the imaginary part of the masses for both the spinors and singlets to be
equal to (1/2  a) in order to agree with the map for the vectors as in table 6. we choose three
specic bps gauge bosons to carry out the analysis explicitly. the results can be easily extended to
all other gauge elds. the representatives we choose are

first of all we see from eq(b.5) that for this gauge bosons to be massless at a = 1/2 we must
have m9 = 1 for the spinors and m9 = 2 for the singlet. furthermore, requiring agreement with
the imaginary part of the masses on the type iib theory we obtain

this xes the radius as a function of the wilson line parameter.

the requirement that the real part is as in table 6 yields for b

these equations imply that b  2z. we choose b = 0 (up to sl(2, z) transformations). the m8
quantum number for the representatives as well as the expression for the real part of the masses

away for a = 1/2 are also xed. we summarise the results in table 8.
