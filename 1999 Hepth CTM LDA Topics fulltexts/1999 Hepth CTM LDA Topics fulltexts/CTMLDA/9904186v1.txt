abstract

we nd static spherically symmetric monopoles in einstein-born-infeld-
higgs model in 3 + 1 dimensions. the solutions exist only when a parameter
 (related to the strength of gravitational interaction) does not exceed certain
critical value. we also discuss magnetically charged non abelian black holes in
this model. we analyse these solutions numerically.

1 introduction

some time ago monopoles in einstein-yang-mills-higgs(eymh) model [1, 2, 3], for
su(2) gauge group with higgs eld in adjoint representation, were studied as a gen-
eralization of the t hooft-ployakov monopole[4] to see the eect of gravity on it. in
particular, it was found that solutions exist up to some critical value of a dimension-
less parameter , characterising the strength of the gravitational interaction, above
which there is no regular solution. the existance of these solutions were also proved
analytically for the case of innite higgs mass[3]. also, non abelian magnetically
charged black hole solutions were shown to exist in this model for both nite[5] as
well as innite[6] value of the coupling constant for higgs eld. the abelian black
holes exists for rh   and non abelian black holes exist in a limited region of the
(, rh) plane.
recently born-infeld theory [7, 8] has received wide publicity, especially in the con-
text of string theory[9]. bogomolnyi-prasad-sommereld (bps) saturated solutions
were obtained in abelian higgs model as well as in o(3) sigma model in 2 + 1 dimen-
sions in presence of born-infeld term[10]. dierent models for domain wall, vortex
and monopole solutions, containing the born-infeld lagrangian were constructed[11]
in such a way that the self-dual equations are identical with the corresponding yang-
mills-higgs model. recently non self-dual monopole solutions were found numerically
in non abelian born-infeld-higgs theory[12].

in this paper we consider the einstein-born-infeld-higgs(ebih) model and study
the monopole and black hole solutions. the solutions are qualitatively similar to
those of eymh model. the black hole congurations have nonzero non abelian eld
strength and hence they are called non abelian black holes[13]. in sec. ii we consider
the model and nd the equations of motion for static spherically symmetric elds. in
sec iii we nd the asymptotic behaviours and discuss the numerical results. finally
we conclude the results in sec. iv.

2 the model

we consider the following einstein-born-infeld-higgs action for su(2) elds with the
higgs eld in the adjoint representation

s = z d4xg [lg + lbi + lh ]

(1)

with

lg =

1

16gr,
1
2

lh = 

dada 

e2g2

4 (cid:16)aa  v2(cid:17)2

and the non abelian born-infeld lagrangian[14],

lbi = 2str 1 s1 +

22 ff  

1

84 (cid:16)f f (cid:17)2!

where

da = a + eabcab

c,

f = f a

ta = (cid:16)aa

  aa

 + eabcab

(cid:17) ta
ac

and the symmetric trace is dened as

str (t1, t2..., tn) =

1

n! x tr (ti1ti2...tin) .

here the sum is over all permutations on the product of the n generators ti. here
we are interested in purely magnetic congurations, hence we have f f  = 0.
expanding the square root in powers of 1
2 we have the
born-infeld lagrangian

2 and keeping up to order 1

lbi =

f a
f a +

962 (cid:20)(cid:16)f a

f a(cid:17)2

+ 2f a

f a

f bf b(cid:21) + o(

1
4 ).

for static spherical symmetric solutions, the metric can be parametrized as[3, 15]

ds2 = e2(r)dt2 + e2(r)dr2 + r2(r)(d2 + sin2 d2)
and we consider the following ansatz for the gauge and scalar elds

aa

t (r) = 0 = aa

r, aa

w (r)  1

w (r)  1

and

a = ea

rvh(r).

(4)
putting the above ansatz in eq.1, dening 2 = 4gv2 and rescaling r  r/ev,  
ev2 and r(r)  r(r)/ev we get the following expression for the lagrangian
2 (cid:16)1 + e2(cid:16)(r)2 + (r2)(cid:17)(cid:17)  2(cid:16)e2v1  e4v2 + v3(cid:17)(cid:21) ,

here the prime denotes dierentiation with respect to r. the dimensionless param-
eter  can be expressed as the mass ratio
 = 4

(9)
with the gauge eld mass mw = ev and the planck mass mp l = 1/g . note that
the higgs mass mh = 2gev.
in the limit of    the above action reduces
to that of the einstein-yang-mills-higgs model[1, 2]. for the case of  = 0 we
must have (r) = 0 = (r) which corresponds to the at space born-infeld-higgs
theory[12]. we now consider the gauge r(r) = r, corresponding to the schwarzschild-
like coordinates and rename r = r. we dene a = e+ and n = e2. varying
the matter eld lagrangian with respect to the metric we nd the energy-momentum
tensor. integrating the tt component of the energy-momentum we get the mass of
the monopole equal to m/evg where

m = 2z 

0

dr(cid:16)nv1  n 2v2 + v3(cid:17)

(10)

following t hooft the electromagnetic u(1) eld strength f can be dened as

f =

then using the ansatz(3) the magnetic eld

bi =

ijkfjk

is equal to ei

r/er2 with a total ux 4/e and unit magnetic charge.

the tt and rr components of einsteins equations are

the equations for the matter elds are

(anv4) = aw   2
r2 (w 2  1) + 2h 2 
(anr2h) = ah(cid:16)2w 2 + g2r2(h 2  1)(cid:17)

(14)

(15)

it is easy to see that a can be elliminated from the matter eld equations using
eq.(12). hence we have to solve three dierential equations eqs. (11),(13) and (14)
for the three elds n, w and h.

3 solutions

3.1 monopoles

for nite g, demanding the solutions to be regular and the monopole mass to be nite
gives the following behaviour near the origin

h = ar + o(r3),
w = 1  br2 + o(r4),
n = 1  cr2 + o(r4),

(16)
(17)
(18)

where a and b are free parameters and c is given by

c = 2 a2 + 4b2 +

g2

20b4

32 ! .

in general, with these initial conditions n can be zero at some nite r where the
solutions become singular. in order to avoid this singularity we have to adjust the
parameters a and b suitably.

for r   we require the solutions to be asymptotically at. hence we impose

n = 1 

2m
r

(19)

then for nite mass conguration we have the following expressions for the gauge
and the higgs elds

w = crm er(cid:18)1 + o(

h = ( 1  br

0 < g  2

f or g = 0 andg > 2.

(20)

(21)

note that the elds have similar kind of asymptotic behaviour in the eymh model[3].
we have solved the equations of motion numerically with the boundary conditions
given by eqs.(16-21). for  = 0, g = 0 and    they corresponds to the
exact prasad-sommereld solution[16]. for nonzero , g and nite  the qualitative
behaviour of the solutions are similar to the corresponding solutions of eymh model.
for large r these solutions converges to their asymptotic values given as in eqs.(19-
21). for a xed value of g and  we solved the equations increasing the value of
. for small value of  the solutions are very close to at space solution. as  is
increased the minimum of the metric function n was found to be decreasing. the
solutions cease to exist for  greater then certain critical value max. for g = 0 and
 = 3 we nd max  2. the prole for the elds for dierent values of  with g = 0
and  = 3 are given in figs.1,2 and 3. the prole for the elds for g = .1,  = 1.0
and  = 3 are given in fig. 4. we nd numerically the mass m = 0.7865 of the
monopole for g = .1,  = 1.0 and  = 3.

3.2 black holes

apart from the regular monopoles, magnetically charged black holes can also exist
in this model. black hole arises when the eld n vanishes for some nite r = rh .
demanding the solutions to be regular near horizon rh we nd the following behaviour
of the elds

n(rh + ) = nh + o(2),
h(rh + ) = hh + hh + o(2),
w (rh + ) = wh + w h + o(2)

(22)

here rh, wh( w (rh)) and hh( w (rh)) are arbitrary. for r   the behaviour
of the elds is same as the regular monopole solution as given by eqs.(19-21). the
black hole has unit magnetic charge with nontrivial gauge eld strength. we found
numerical solutions to the non abelian black hole for dierent rh. for a xed value
of rh we nd the solutions for r > rh adjusting the parameters wh and hh. for rh
close to zero the solutions approach the regular monopole solutions. the prole for
the elds are given in fig.5. we found the mass of the black hole equals to be 0.6796
for  = 1.0, g = 0 and  = 3.

4 conclusion

in this paper we have investigated the eect of gravity on the born-infeld-higgs
monopole. we found that solutions exist only up to some critical value max of
the parameter .
in the limit    these solutions reduces to those of eymh
monopoles. we also found numerically magnetically charged non abelian black hole
solutions in this model. it would be interesting to prove analytically the existence of
these solutions for nite value of the parameters. recently dyons and dyonic black
holes were found in eymh model numerically[17] and the existence of critical value
for  was also proved analytically [18]. it may be possible to generalize these solutions
to nd dyons and dyonic black holes in ebih model. we hope to report on this issue
in future.
