(13) order understand small large gauge transformationsthe latter generated rst-class constraint (~x)are represented terms mode expansions, let us consider general gauge transformation eld a, namely = + , associa- ted u(1) local phase transformation u (~x, x0) = ei(~x,x0). point central discussion arbitrary function (~x, x0) may always expressed (~x, x0) = 0(~x, x0) + 2k1x1 + 2k2x2 , (14) 4 0(~x, x0) arbitrary periodic functioni.e. scalar eld t2while k1 k2 arbitrary positive negative integers. indeed, small gauge transformation dened terms function 0(~x, x0) (k1, k2) = (0, 0), large gauge transformation (~x, x0) may always brought general form specic function 0(~x, x0), integers k1 k2 labelling u(1) holonomies gauge transformation around chosen b homology cycles t2. gauge transformation thus falls terms mode expansion (k1, k2) homotopy class gauge group t2. gauge parameter function (14), non-zero modes ai (n1, n2) (n1 6= 0 n2 6= 0, both) transformed according a++ 1 (n1, n2) = +2n1+ 0 (n1, n2) , a++ 2 (n1, n2) = +2n2+0 (n1, n2) , (n1, n2) = 2n2++ (n1, n2) = +2n20 0 (n1, n2) , (n1, n2) , (15) , a2 (n1, n2) = 2n2+ (n1, n2), zero modes a++ 0 (n1, n2) , (0, 0) transform a+1 (n1, n2) = +2n10 (n1, n2) , a+2 a+ 1 a1 (n1, n2) = 2n1++ (n1, n2) = 2n1+0 0 (n1, n2) (n1, n2) , a+ 2 ai (n1, n2) = (cid:16)ai (n1, n2)(cid:17)ai a++ 1 (0, 0) = 2k1 , a++ 2 (0, 0) = 2k2 .
