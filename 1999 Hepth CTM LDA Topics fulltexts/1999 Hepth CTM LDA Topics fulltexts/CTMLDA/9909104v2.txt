abstract

the hidden e7(e6) structure has been conjectured for the min-
imal model m4,5(m6,7) perturbed by 1,2 in the context of confor-
mal eld theory(cft). motivated by this, we examine the dilute
a4,6 models, which are expected to be corresponding lattice mod-
els. thermodynamics of the equivalent one dimensional quantum
systems is analyzed via the quantum transfer matrix approach. ap-
propriate auxiliary functions, related to kinks in the theory, play
a role in constructing functional relations among transfer matri-
ces. we successfully recover the universal y  systems and thereby
thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations for e6,7 from the dilute
a6,4 model, respectively.

1 introduction

the impact of perturbed conformal eld theory (cft) has many aspects
[1, 2]. in this communication we explore one of its predictions; the trin-
ity among minimal unitary cft theory mp,p+1, p = 3, 4, 6 perturbed by
1,2, lattice models o criticality, (the ising model in a eld, the tricritical
ising model o the critical temperature and the tricritical 3 state potts
model) and the dilute a3,4,6 models. many results have already been accu-
mulated on the equivalence in universality [3]-[18]. the scaling exponents
of the dilute a3 model in periodic or open boundary conditions have been
evaluated analytically [12]-[17]. they agree with numerical results for the
ising model in a magnetic eld. masses for eight elementary excitations
of the dilute a3 model are found to be proportional to components of the
(largest) eigenvector of cartan matrix for e8[16, 18]. vertex operators of
a(2)
2 , which is the symmetry of the dilute a3 model at criticality, satisfy a
set of relations indicating the hidden e8 structure [19].

especially, we like to call attention to thermodynamics of a 1d system
related to the dilute a3 model in [20]. a set of solutions to the eigenvalue
problem of the 1d hamiltonian has been identied in exquisite string
forms [20, 21, 22]. nine of them are expected to contribute nontrivially
in the thermodynamic limit. this observation leads to a set of integral
equations (thermodynamic bethe ansatz , tba ) which determines the
free energy. remarkably, tba exhibits the underlying e8 structure [23].
in [24], we have attacked the same problem in a dierent setting. by
following general frameworks, one represents the free energy by the largest
eigenvalue of the quantum transfer matrix (qtm) acting on a virtual
space [25] -[31]. we have managed to solve the (single) eigenvalue problem
of commuting qtm by introducing auxiliary functions related to fusion
of qtm [32, 34, 35]. we will simply call them fusion qtms. eight fusion
qtms are found to satisfy a closed set of functional relations related to
e8. a quantum analogue of the jacobi-trudi formula [36, 39], as well as
combinatorial aspects in terms of yangian analogue of young tableaux
[36, 37, 38, 39, 40] play a fundamental part in the proof of the relations.
nice analytic properties of fusion qtms allow for the transformation of
functional relations into coupled integral equations. the resultant thermo-
dynamic bethe ansatz (tba) equation yields a direct evaluation of free
energy. again it coincides with a hypothetical tba for the e8 theory.

as promised in [24], we carry out this program for the dilute a4 and
a6 models. a novel feature lies in the fact that a box of the young
tableaux is no longer the fundamental constituent. this may be natural
in view of the representation theory; the vector representation is no longer
minimal. in the language of the s-matrix theory, boxes present breathers,
rather than kinks. we conjecture explicit forms of qtms related to these

2

kinks. the investigation on these kink qtms reveals connections between
uq(a(2)
2 ) modules of symmetric tensors of the vector representation and

uq(ce6), uq(ce7) modules when q equals to proper root of unity. with help

of this observation, closed functional relations among fusion qtms are also
found for the dilute a4,6 models. quite parallel to the dilute a3 model,
one recovers tbas expected for e6,7 [23].

the paper is organized as follows. as the subject may not be so familiar
to readers, we present a brief survey on the qtm approach, together with
the sketch of the idea of analytic bethe ansatz in section 2. the dilute
al model is briey described in section 3. the sl3 fusion structure of
the model is presented in view of analytic bethe ansatz, the yangian
analogue of young tableaux and the quantum jacobi-trudi formula in
section 4. we concentrate on the dilute a4 model in sections 5 and 6.
the explicit form of qtm related to the kink is proposed in section 5.
yangian homomorphisms among y (e7) modules serve as a useful guide
in search of the form. the rest of qtms are dened and their functional
relations are examined in section 6. the result coincides with prediction
in [58]. similar results for the dilute a6 model are given in section 7. with
piece of information on analyticity of these qtms, supported by numerics,
the desired tbas are recovered in section 8. we conclude the paper with
a short summary in section 9.

2 survey on the qtm approach

exact evaluation of physical quantities at nite temperatures poses serious
diculties even for integrable models. one has to go much beyond mere
diagonalization of a hamiltonian; summation over eigenspectra must be
performed.

the string hypothesis brought the rst breakthrough and success. it
postulates dominant solutions to the bethe ansatz equation (bae) in the
thermodynamic limit. in a sense, the method tackles the combinatorial
aspect of the problem directly.

2.1 qtm

the quantum transfer matrix (qtm) method takes a dierent route. it
utilizes the famous mapping between the hamiltonian hm of a 1d quan-
tum system and the row to row transfer matrix trt r(u) of the correspond-
ing 2d classical model [25] -[31]. in the present context, the latter is given
by

(trtr(u)){b}

{a} =

myj=1

bj
aj

u bj+1
aj+1

.

3

here the box represents the rsos weight and m is the number of sites.
see appendix for explicit weights for the dilute al models. the parameter
u represents the anisotropy of interactions between horizontal and verti-
cal directions, and is called the spectral parameter. the explicit relation
between hm and trt r(u) reads,

trt r(u)  trt r(0)(1 +

u
 hm + o(u2)),

where  is the normalization parameter of the hamiltonian. the essential
idea in the qtm approach is encoded in the following identity,

exp(hm ) = lim
= lim

n

(1 +

u
 hm )n|u/n
rt r(u = /n)(cid:1)n
:= (cid:16)trt r(u)(trt r(0))1(cid:17)n

n(cid:0)t 

.

t 
rt r(u)

namely, the partition function of the original problem is transformed into
that of the 2d classical models on m n sites. the ctitious dimension n
is sometimes referred to as the trotter number. we can interpret t 
rt r(u)
as the row to row transfer matrix in the vertical direction. similarly, one
can construct a transfer matrix propagating in the horizontal direction
t 
qt m (u), which acts on n sites. thereby we have

tr exp(hm ) = lim

n

tr t 

qt m (u = /n)m .

it may be better to rewrite this in the form,

lim
m 

1
m

log(cid:16)tr exp(hm )(cid:17) = lim

n

lim
m 

1

m(cid:16)tr t 

qt m (u = /n)m(cid:17).

the exchangeability of two limits are proven in [25].
the gap opens up between the largest and the second largest eigenvalues
of t 
qt m (u). in the thermodynamic limit m  , we only have to deal
with the largest eigenvalue of qtm. this strongly contrasts to the spectra
of t 
rt r(u). one observes almost degenerate low lying excitations in the
latter case as m  . the evaluation of free energy per site of the
1d quantum system is thus reduced to the largest eigenvalue problem of
t 
qt m (u). we are free from the summation problem.

this is, unfortunately, not the happy end of the story. the trotter
number should be sent innity at the end. the diagonalization of qtm
is accomplished by the application of the bethe ansatz method. the bae
depends nontrivially on n, which originates from the local interaction
parameter u. thus we can not retort to the simple-mind application of the
usual scheme of converting the transcendental equation into the integral
equation. this makes the extrapolation n   quite nontrivial.

4

2.2

commuting qtm

instead of dealing with bae roots directly, we employ a dierent idea. the
integrable structure of the underlying model allows for the introduction
of one parameter family of commuting qtms which is labeled by a novel
complex parameter x. for the explicit demonstration of this, we adopt a
more sophisticate approach [32, 33] than the one presented above. one
introduces a staggered manner qtm to avoid (trt r(0))1 factor in the
denition of t 

rt r(u).

, x = 0)(cid:17).

as is emphasized above, we nd the intriguing fact, commutativity of

qtms,

[tqtm(u, x), tqtm(u, x)] = 0.

generally, one can construct a higher spin qtm tfusion(u, x) by the
fusion procedure. the yang baxter integrability also assures commutativ-
ity among these generalized qtms,

[tfusion(u, x), tfusion(u, x)] = 0.

note that the factor u is in common. hereafter we will sometimes drop
this common factor in commuting qtms. we also sometimes use same
notations for transfer matrices and their eigenvalues as we are considering
them on the identical eigenspace.

we utilize the existence of the complex x plane in which qtms are si-
multaneously diagonalizable. there exist functional relations among these
fusion qtms in the x plane. our idea is to utilize these functional relations
in place of bae. see [52, 53] for the discussion in the case of usual row to
row transfer matrices. our motivation is simple. the number of roots is
of order n, the trotter number. all these locations are changing with n,
while functional relations depend on n weakly. the dependence can be
summarized in the known scalar factors in functional relations. one may
expect the tractable limit n   for functional relations. the problem
of combinatorics (summation over eigenspectra ) is then reduced to the

5

study of functional relations 1 and analytic structures of fusion qtms, as
will be discussed soon below.

2.3 analytic bethe ansatz and functional relations

the qtms should not possess singularities in the x plane as boltzmann
weights are regular functions of x. bae can be interpreted as the pole-
free condition of qtms in the complex x plane. conversely, the analyticity
requirement imposes restrictions on explicit eigenvalues of qtms.

the analytic bethe ansatz was proposed in [55], as a tool in deriving
expressions of eigenvalues of transfer matrices. it starts from a simple ob-
servation; the eigenvalue at the vacuum sector is determined by diagonal
elements of r matrix, which are referred to as vacuum expectation values.
in general sectors, eigenvalues should be modied such that each vacuum
expectation value is dressed by appropriate combination of baxters q
operators. see eq.(4) for a typical example. the combination is determined
by requiring analyticity of the transfer matrix. we call the resultant ex-
pression, dressed vacuum form (dvf).

a universal bae has been proposed in [55, 56]; one can write down
bae for the model based on uq(g) using only algebraic data of uq(g).
starting from a properly chosen highest weight term, we can construct
a pole-free set of functions under bae. in [38] a similarity has been
pointed out between the above procedure and the construction of the
highest weight module of lie algebra. it leads to an assumption that there
exists a set of functions, pole-free under bae, corresponding to an irre-
ducible module of quantum ane lie algebra. the set is naturally identi-
ed with the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix of which trace is taken over
the irreducible module. this has been promoted as an axiom in [38] and
subsequent papers [39, 40] producing fruitful results. we take sl2 as the
simplest example. by vm(x) (tm(x)), we mean the m+1-dimensional sl2
module, and the associated transfer matrix. the dvf of t1(x) consists
of two terms. we do not specify their forms and represent them by boxes
with letters 1 and 2,

t1(x) = 1 x + 2 x.

each box carries spurious poles, which are actually canceled due to bae.
we represent this situation graphically as,

1 x  2 x.

the eigenvalue of a fusion qtm can be apparently represented by sum
over products of boxes with various letters and spectral parameters.

1 one can adopt dierent auxiliary functions from the fusion hierarchy. results on

other choices of auxiliary functions for several models, see [33],[45]-[51]

6

for example, one can construct a transfer matrix of which auxiliary space
acts on the symmetric subspace of v1  v1. we associate to this the set of
glued boxes, i1 xi i2 x+i, (i1  i2). the dierence in spectral parameters
is xed so as to match the singularity of r matrix. the cancellation of
spurious singularities is again depicted as

1 1  1 2  2 2 ,

where we omit spectral parameters. the eigenvalue of t2(x) is given by
the sum of three diagrams in the above. extension to general tm is now
obvious. starting from the highest weight term, 1
1 , we
have a cancellation diagram,

  

1

1

1

  

1  1

1

  

2      2

2

  

2 .

the sum over them, regarded as expressions, yields the eigenvalue of
tm(x). one can easily identied the diagram with the crystal graph of
the m-fold tensor of uq(sl2) representing the irreducible module.

suppose that we have a short exact sequence among tensor products

of irreducible modules of quantum ane lie algebra,

0  w0  w1  w2  w3  w4  w5  0,

then a functional relation follows,

0 = tw0tw1  tw2tw3 + tw4tw5.

remark that spectral parameter dependencies are implicit in wis 2. the
desired functional relations are derived as a consequence of relations
among ane modules. even if exact sequences are not available, one can
still check the validity of hypothetical functional relations using explicit
forms of transfer matrices, which can be derived by applying the analytic
bethe ansatz. indeed, functional relations for sl2 are easily derived with-
out knowledge on exact sequences. by using the above box-representation,
one can derive graphically,

tm(x  i)tm(x + i) = gm(x) + tm1(x)tm+1(x) m  1,

(1)

where gm(x) is a known scalar function which depends on n.

such functional relations are sometimes referred to as the t system.
2to be precise, we rst consider a vertex model of which quantum space (auxiliary
space) is given by wi and denote the transfer matrix by twi. later section we use the
same notation for the transfer matrix of the corresponding rsos model

7

2.4 functional relations and thermodynamic bethe

ansatz

unfortunately, functional relations alone do not provide enough informa-
tion on the explicit eigenvalues. this can be easily seen from the fact that
excited states eigenvalues satisfy same algebraic relations. one needs ad-
ditional information on analyticities of fusion qtms. let us again demon-
strate this for the sl2 case. one conveniently rewrites the t system (1)
in terms of ym(x) = tm1(x)tm+1(x)/gm(x),

ym(x  i)ym(x + i) = (1 + ym1(x))(1 + ym+1(x)),

(2)

where a known property of the g function, gm(x + i)gm(x  i) =
gm1(x)gm+1(x) is used.
consider functions in the largest eigenvalue sector of t1(x). we have
convincing numerical evidences for the conjecture that zeros of tm(x) ap-
proximately lie on the curve x  (m + 1). then both sides of (2) are
analytic, nonzero and asymptotically constant (anzc) within the strip
x  [1, 1]. strictly speaking, we must modify the lhs for m = 1. we
will not go into such detail in this introductory part.
this piece of information is now sucient to transform the algebraic
relations to integral equations which enable the explicit evaluation of ym
and then tm.

take the logarithmic derivatives of both sides of (2) and perform
fourier transformations. let dlym[k] be the fourier transformation of
the logarithmic derivative of ym(x). thanks to the anzc property, the
cauchy theorem applies. the resultant equation is simply given by
2 cosh k dlym[k] = dl(1 + ym1)[k] + dl(1 + ym+1)[k].(m  2)

remarkably, both sides only contain functions with the same fourier
mode. dividing both sides by 2 cosh k, performing inverse fourier transfor-
mation and integrating once over x, we reach the integral equation, which
is identical to tba,

log ym(x) =z 



k(x  y) log(1 + ym1)(1 + ym+1)(y)dy.

(m  2)
(3)

k(x) denotes the fourier transformation of 1/2 cosh k. though we have
omitted above, the rhs of the equation (3) for m = 1 has a nontrivial
scalar factor originated from g function. it thus brings a n dependency,
however, by the combination un in the n   limit. remembering that
u is inversely proportional to n, we can send n   analytically! the
resultant drive term depends only on .

8

in this way, we take a completely dierent route from the string hy-
pothesis but reach the same conclusion. in the absence of appropriate
conjectures on dominant patterns of roots, our method has an explicit
advantage in attacking the problem. this is the case with the dilute a4,6
models. 3

in the rest of this paper, we shall extensively apply the above ideas
to these cases. before that, we repeat lessons from the above. to nd
functional relations is not enough. one must nd them having anzc
property in appropriate domains of the complex x plane. this is the most
crucial step in the present approach.

3 the dilute al model

the dilute al model is proposed in [12, 13] as an elliptic extension of
the izergin-korepin model [41]. (see [42] for an elliptic extension of the
dierent type.) the model is of the restricted sos type with local variables
 {1, 2,   , l}. the variables {a, b} on neighboring sites should satisfy
adjacency condition, |a b|  1. the solvable weights contain parameters
u, q and . we supplement their explicit forms in appendix. the model
exhibits four dierent physical regimes depending on parameters,

4(l+1) , l  2
4(l+1) , l  3

 regime 1. 0 < u < 3,  = l
 regime 2. 0 < u < 3,  = (l+2)
 regime 3. 3  
 regime 4. 3  

 < u < 0,  = l

 < u < 0,  = (l+2)

4(l+1) , l  3
4(l+1) , l  2

we are interested in regimes 2 and 3. as in section2, one denes the
hamiltonian of the associated 1d quantum chain by

h = 


u

ln trtr(u)|u=0

as in [20].  = 1, (1) corresponds to regimes 2 (3), respectively.
the one particle excitations for the dilute al case have been examined
in [43, 44] for l =3,4 and 6. (see also [18] for another derivation for l = 3)
eight, seven and six particles are identied respectively, and their masses
are summarized by a single formula in the trigonometric limit,

3although yet unpublished, there is also progress in view of string hypothesis for

these cases. the author thanks v.v. bazhanov and o. warnaar for information.

where g is 30, 18, 12 for l =3,4, 6 and is nothing but the dual coxeter
number for e8, e7 and e6, respectively. we present sets of allowed as in
table 1,2 for l =4, 6, which are of our current interest.

are just indices up to the present, will be connected to indices for nodes
in the dynkin diagrams of e7 and e6.

4 sl3 fusion structure and quantum jacobi

trudi formula

the sl3 type fusion structure in the dilute al model has been discussed in
[54]. this comes from the singularity of rsos weights at u = 3; the face

10

operator becomes a projector related to sl3 at these points. one picks up
a desired subspace from tensor products of spaces using these projectors.
the adjacency conditions of local states are described by combinatorics of
tableaux.

we are interested in eigenvalues of fusion qtms. then the most rel-
evant is the fact that these eigenvalues are again expressible in terms of
young tableaux depending on spectral parameters, as exemplied in
section 2.3 for the sl2 case.

explicitly, the eigenvalue t1(u, x) of tqtm(u, x) is given by

t1(u, x) = w(x +

(5)

as in section 2, we represent these three terms by three boxes with

letters 1,2 and 3,

t1(u, x) = 1 x + 2 x + 3 x.

(6)

one infers from the sl2 example that a combinatorial aspect may also
appear. this turns out to be true. the eigenvalues of fusion qtms are
given by the sum of combinations of boxes, which can be identied with
semi-standard young tableaux for sl3. on each diagram, the spectral pa-
rameter changes +2i from the left to the right and 2i from the top to
the bottom. (fig 2).
we restrict ourselves to diagrams of the rectangular shape for a while.
firstly we note that qtm associated to 2  m ( 3  m) young diagram
can be reduced to the one associated to 1  m (or just scalars). this is

second, eigenvalues of 1  m fusion qtms have the duality in the fol-
lowing sense. let us denote a renormalized 1  m fusion qtm by tm(x);
(7)

tm(x) =

the spectral parameters are assigned x  i(m  1)   x + i(m  1) from
the left to the right. the renormalization factor, common factor to all
expressions of length m tableaux, is given by

fm(x) :=

m1yj=1

(x  i(

2m  1

2

 j)).

hereafter we sometimes denote f (x  iy) := f (x + iy)f (x  iy).
we have a periodicity due to boltzmann weights;

the resultant tms are all degree 2n w.r.t. h[x + shift ]. obviously,

tm(x +

10
3

i) = tm(x),

(tm(x +

4

i) = tm(x))

(8)

for the dilute a4 (a6) model. from the sl3 structure, together with the
above property, one can prove the following functional relations,

tm(x  i)tm(x + i) = gm(x)tm(x) + tm+1(x)tm1(x), m  1

gm(x) = (x  i(m + 3/2)),
t1(x)
t0(x)

:= 0
:= f2(x).

(9)

12

the periodicity for the dilute a4 model , (x + 10/3i) = (x), leads
to gm+10(x) = gm(x) m  0 and g7m(x) = gm(x), (0  m  7). from the
adjacency matrix, one concludes t8,9(x) = 0.
thus functional relations are invariant under the transformation,
tm(x)  t7m(x) (m = 0,   , 7) or tm(x)  tm+10(x) (m  1). the
symmetry of functional relations is not necessary inherited to its solution
in general. we verify, however, the duality,

tm(x) = t7m(x), m = 0,   , 7

(10)

and tm+10(x) = tm(x), m  1 numerically for the largest eigenvalue
sector, only which we are interested in. these duality relations are also
observed and numerically veried for a6 models with change in the period.
see section 7.

functional relations among them, however, do not possess the desired
analytical property, as discussed in [24]. we thus introduce other class of
qtms related to skew young diagrams.

let  and  be a pair of young diagrams satisfying i  i,i. we
subtract a diagram  from . we call the result a skew young diagram
 , consisted of (1 1, 2 2,   ) boxes. in the theory of symmetric

figure 3: an example of a skew young table, (4,4)-(2)

polynomials, the jacobi-trudi formula tells that a complex schur function
associated to a skew young diagram can be expressed by a determinant
of a matrix, of which elements are given by elementary schur functions
associate to one-row diagrams or  one-column ones. the quite paral-
lel formula holds for the present situation, which we call the quantum
jacobi-trudi formula [36, 38, 39].

consider a set of semi-standard skew young tableaux of the shape

the proof is quite similar to the one for young tableaux[38, 39]. one
must only keep in mind that the allowed position of a box is restricted by
its spectral parameter.

the crucial fact is that the so dened t/(x) is an analytic function of
x due to bae, and contains t1(x) as a special case. the former is not so
obvious from the original denition by the tableaux, but it follows trivially
from the quantum jacobi-trudi formula.

in the same spirit, we introduce /(x), which is analytic under bae,

by putting tm8(x) = 0 in t/(x),

/(x) := t/(x)/.{tm8(x) = 0},

(12)

for the dilute a4 model. the pole-free property of /(x) is obvious from
(11). for the dilute a6 model, we dene /(x) by setting tm11(x) = 0.

5 kink transfer matrix

in following few sections, we restrict our discussion to the dilute a4 model.
we will summarize results for the dilute a6 model in section 7.

for the e8 case, the vector representation is minimal and other repre-
sentations are constructed by fusion of it. eigenvalues of associated trans-
fer matrices of the dilute a3 model are thus derived from products of
t1(x + some shift).

14

this is no longer true for the dilute a4 model. let wa(x) be the yan-
gian highest weight module associated to the node a in figure 1. through
several evidences, we identify t1(x) of the model with the transfer matrix
connected to w1(x), which is not minimal. the most fundamental object
in e7 is w6(x) rather than w1(x). any other object may be constructed
from t (6)(x), the transfer matrix of w6(x), of which explicit form is not
known from the dilute a4 model. the determination of explicit form of
t (6)(x) is thus vital in the present approach. for this purpose, homo-
morphisms of uq(g) modules deserve attentions. they lead to non-trivial
algebraic relations among t (6)(x) and other qtms. although such infor-
mation is not available for uq( e7), there exists a list of homomorphisms
of y (e7) modules in [57],

as explicit rsos weights are not yet derived, it may be inappropriate
to call t (6)(x) as the eigenvalue of transfer matrix. in the following dis-
cussion, however, we do not use the assumption that it coincides with the
actual eigenvalue of transfer matrix of w6. rather, we simply use facts

cilitate discussions in later sections.

proof: the duality relation (10) plays a fundamental role in the proof.
the direct substitutions of eq.(18) in the lhs of eqs. (20), (21) and (23)
yield 1/2(t3(x) + t4(x)) , 1/2(t1(x + i 10
6 i) + 2t1(x)) and
1/2(t2(x) + t5(x)) + t0(x + 10
6 i), respectively. we remark that non-trivial
cancellation of terms occurs due to w5 = 1.
these results coincide with the rhs due to dualities t3 = t4, t1 = t6 and
t2 = t5.
rests follow from these by x  x + i 10
6 .
these relations suggest the underlying homomorphisms between
uq( e7) and uq(a(2)
2 ) modules at q = exp(i/20), q = exp(i3/10). this
may be an interesting but an independent subject from the present prob-
lem thus we will not go into detail here.

6 fusion quantum transfer matrices and

the t system for the dilute a4 model

having dened the kink qtm t (6), we are in position to introduce other
qtms and explore functional relations among them.

first we present qtms dened by skew young tableaux.

(27)

we have two comments.
first, one can equivalently rewrite (25) and (26) in terms of (6,6)/(5) or
(6,6,1)/(5)(x) using relations,

(6,6)/(5)(x) = (6,1)(x + 5i)

(6,6,1)/(5)(x) = (11,6,6)/(5,5)(x).

(28)
(29)

these are outcome of the quantum jacobi-trudi formula and duality (10).
the second comment concerns the complex conjugate property. in the
largest eigenvalue sector of qtm, we conrm numerically q(x) = q(x).
the explicit forms of dvfs in eq.(4) and eq.(18) then conclude t (1)(x) =
t (1)(x), t (6)(x) = t (6)(x). by remembering 5/3i equals to the half period
of our elliptic function 1(x), one also veries t (5)(x) = t (5)(x). the con-
jugate property of t (2)(x) and t (3)(x) is less obvious. one can nevertheless
show this by the use of the quantum jacobi-trudi formula.

t (6) comes into expressions of remaining qtms. the yangian homo-
morphisms turn out to be useful in deriving their explicit forms. we take
t (4)(x), related to w4(x), for instance. as argued in section 2.3, we iden-
tify an analytic set with an ane irreducible module. thus eq. (13) for
a = 2 implies,

t (5)(x  i/6)t (6)(x + i/3)  t (4)(x) + t (x).

that is, the product of dvfs t (5)(x  i/6)t (6)(x + i/3) decomposes into
two (or more) subsets and each subset is analytic within itself. we look
at the explicit dvf of the lhs and nd that it contains analytic subset
given by (x + 4
3 i). the sum of remaining terms must
be analytic under bae. we identify them as t (4)(x). in a similar way, we
deduce t (7)(x).

property is not so apparent for t (4)(x), although one can prove it by a
dierent route. see the discussion after the proof of eq.(36).

proof of eqs.(32) and (33).
take the simpler case (32) rst. we consider the decomposition of the

tableaux, we have

t1(x  6i)t6(x + i) = (6,1)(x) + t7(x)t0(x  5i),

which can also be veried from the quantum jacobi-trudi formula. by
utilizing dualities t6(x) = t1(x), t7(x) = t0(x) and the periodicity , one
recovers eq.(32) after the shift x  x  5
eq.
of
(6,6)/(5)(x)(6,1)(x + 12i). see fig. 5. the lhs of the arrow contains
two young diagrams corresponding to (6,6)/(5)(x) and (6,1)(x + 12i)
(hatched) in the relative position, compatible with the shift in the
spectral parameter. we then employ the recombination of boxes, as
in usual young diagrams. two rules need particular attention. first, we
must put box so as to match the spectral parameter. second, due to
the condition tm8(x) = 0 in the denition of /(x), the width of a
column in the resultant young diagram must be less equal to 7. then
two terms result from the recombination as depicted in the rhs of the
arrow, (11,6,6)/(5,5)(x  8i)t1(x + 6i) and t7(x)t7(x + 12i). we still leave
hatch to boxes which once belong to (6,1)(x + 12i). note that the gure
represents the equality of the dvfs in terms of boxes. thus it needs
proper normalization factors, viewed as the relation between /(x) or
tm(x), due to scalar factors in the denitions (7) of tm(x) and of t/(x)
(and then /(x)) in theorem 1. then one nds, with the property (28),

(6,1)(x  5i)(6,1)(x + 12i) = (11,6,6)/(5,5)(x  8i)t1(x + 6i)

where the factor in front of t7(x)t7(x + 12i) comes from f7(x)f7(x +
12i)/f6(x + i)f6(x + 13i). finally let us shift the spectral parameter by
+i4/6 and use the periodicity (8). then eq.(33) follows from denitions
(25),(26) and t7 = t0.

as mentioned previously, the complex conjugate property of t (4)(x)
is not obvious from its dvf. instead, we can now shown it from the
established relation (36) with the help of the conjugate property of t (5)(x)
and t (6)(x) commented below (27).

to prove remaining relations, we need to prepare further lemmas.

proof of lemma 4. for convenience, we go back to the original denition of
t(11,11,6,6)/(10,5,5)(x). thanks to the semi-standard condition, it decomposed
into pieces. we consequently have

height 3 piece in the middle of the rhs reduces to a known scalar factor.

then the equality (42)=(43) with properties tm+10(x) = tm(x) and
t7m(x) = tm(x) leads to lemma 4 after renormalization.

where we have used denitions (24) and (27) to rewrite t (1) and t (5) by

of t (6) are such that one can apply eqs. (19), (20) and (21). the result of
the application then agrees with the rhs of the equality in lemma 5.

by comparing the rhs of lemma 4 and lemma 5 with use of the duality

this is nothing but lemma 6. one thus completes the proof of proposition.

in next section, we summarize similar results for the dilute a6 model

without proof.

7 the t system for the dilute a6 model

we rstly comment on the duality property in the dilute a6 model,

tm(x) = t11m(x),

m = 0,   , 11

and t12(x) = t13(x) = 0. this is again compatible with the symmetry of
functional relations but is still a conjecture supported by numerics.

the yangian representation theory asserts that irreducible modules of
y (e6) are made by tensoring minimal objects, w1(x) and w5(x). on the
other hand, we assume

t1(x) = t (6)(x)

as qtm for w6(x). thus the situation is similar to the e7 case; one
must gure out eigenvalues of qtms associated to w1(x) and w5(x)
independently from the knowledge of the dilute a6 model. we conjecture
that eigenvalues of qtms for these are same and its explicit form reads,

t (1)(x) = t (5)(x)

then new sets of functional relations (the y  system) follow from the
tsystems.
theorem 2 functional relations among y  functions exhibit the e6,7
structure in the following form,

y (a)(x  i)y (a)(x + i) =yba

(1 + y (b)(x)),

a = 1,   , amax.

here amax = 6(7) for the dilute a6 (a4 ) model, respectively. we denote
a  b if a and b are adjacent nodes in the e6(e7) dynkin diagram.
this coincides with the e6,7 case of the universal y  system in [59].
the derivation of tba from the y  system needs some information
on the analytic structures of y (a)(x), 1 + y (a)(x). as stressed in the survey
section, only the y  system with nice analytic properties (anzc) yields
an explicit algorithm in the evaluation of free energy.
we employ numerical calculations for some xed values of n and  for
this purpose. this is relatively facile as one has only to deal with the largest
eigenvalue sector. though we have performed the numerical calculation for
small values of n, it already reveals intriguing patterns for zeros of t (a)(x),
which are also observed for the dilute a3 model. namely, imaginary parts
of coordinates of zeros show the remarkable coincidence with exponents
related to mass spectra in table 1. we state it as a conjecture for arbitrary
n.

conjecture 1 zeros of t (a) distribute along approximately on lines,
x   1

lute a6 model. the set {aj} agrees with {a} for the particle j in table 1
(table2).

6 (aj + 1) for the dilute a4 model and  1

27

therefore, we have a lemma parallel to the dilute a3 case.

lemma 7 assume that the above conjecture is valid. then gy (a)(x) and
1 + y (a)(x) are analytic, nonzero and have constant asymptotic behavior
(anzc) in strips x  [1, 1], [0+, 0+], respectively.
gy (a)(x) is dened by
gy (a)(x) =


y (a)(x)/{(x + i(1 + u))(x  i(1 + u))},
y (a)(x)(x + i(1  u))(x  i(1  u)),
y (a)(x),

and u = 6u(4u) for the dilute a4 (a6) model. the renormalization factor
is given by

for a = 1(6), u < 0
for a = 1(6), u > 0
otherwise

(x) =(cid:16) 1(iv/4,  )

2(iv/4,  )(cid:17)n/2

where   = 5 ( 7

2 ) for the dilute a4 (a6) model.

the signicance of the above property is clear when one considers
these relations (to be precise, logarithmic derivatives of them) in fourier
space, or k space. cauchys theorem assures that all quantities satisfy
algebraic equations at same k , i.e., without mixing of modes. thus they
can be solved in an elementary way. we omit the explicit procedure, for it
has been given for other models [34, 35, 24]. the resultant coupled integral
equations read

s(x) =

lny (a)(x) = a,tes(x) + ca,b  ln(1 + y (b))(x),

9 conclusion

we have seen that the e6,7,8 structure appears in the dilute a6,4,3 model;
exponents of mass scale , zeros of qtms and tbas. these results strongly
support the underlying e type symmetry in the dilute al model.

a yangian analogue of young tableaux arises in proof of the t sys-
tem. the combinatorial aspects provide interesting problems on their own.
we thus believe that the subject is worth of further research.
