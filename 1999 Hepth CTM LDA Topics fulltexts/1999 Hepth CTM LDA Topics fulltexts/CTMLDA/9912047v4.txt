abstract

i carefully study noncommutative version of adhm construction of instantons, which
was proposed by nekrasov and schwarz. noncommutative r4 is described as algebra of
operators acting in fock space. in adhm construction of instantons, one looks for zero-
modes of dirac-like operator. the feature peculiar to noncommutative case is that these
zero-modes project out some states in fock space. the mechanism of these projections is
claried when the gauge group is u(1). i also construct some zero-modes when the gauge
group is u(n) and demonstrate that the projections also occur, and the mechanism is
similar to the u(1) case. a physical interpretation of the projections in iib matrix model
is briey discussed.

1 introduction

one of the most important reasons to consider physics on noncommutative spacetime is
that the behavior of the theory at short distance is expected to become manageable due
to the noncommutativity of the spacetime coordinates. it was shown [1] that noncommu-
tative geometry appear in a denite limit of string theory, bfss matrix theory [2] and
iib matrix theory [3]. in these cases noncommutativity should be relevant to the short
scale physics of d-branes.

among d-brane systems, dp-brane-d(p+4)-brane bound states are of interest because
this system has two dierent descriptions: the one in terms of the worldvolume theory of
dp-branes and another in terms of the worldvolume theory of d(p + 4)-branes. the d-at
condition of the worldvolume theory of dp-brane coincides with adhm equations [5][6],
and dp-branes are described as instantons in d(p + 4)-brane worldvolume theory. these
descriptions should be equivalent because both describe the same system, and indeed
the moduli space of the worldvolume theory of dp-branes is identical to the instanton
moduli space. turning constant ns-ns b-eld in the worldvolume of d(p + 4)-branes
causes noncommutativity in the worldvolume theory of d(p + 4)-branes, and adds fayet-
iliopoulos d-term in the worldvolume theory of dp-branes [16][11]. the equivalence of
two descriptions follows from the pioneering work of nekrasov and schwarz [12]. in order
to construct instantons on noncommutative r4, one adds a constant (corresponding to
the fayet-iliopoulos term) to the adhm equations.1 the modied adhm equations
describe the resolutions of singularities in the moduli space of instantons on r4 [8]. this
moduli space has been an important clue to the nonperturbative aspects of string theory
[17][18][19][20][21][22] and matrix theory [11][23][24][25][26]. further studies from the
viewpoints of both string theory and noncommutative geometry were recently given by
[15]. more recently braden and nekrasov constructed instantons on blowups of c2, which
are conjectured to be related to instantons on noncommutative r4 [13].2

in [12] nekrasov and schwarz explicitly constructed some instanton solutions and
showed that they are non-singular. an interesting point is that they are non-singular even
if their commutative counterparts in original adhm construction are singular, so-called
small instantons. in these cases noncommutativity of the coordinates actually eliminates
the singular behavior of the eld congurations. what is special to the noncommutative
case is the appearance of projection operators which project out potentially dangerous
states in fock space, where fock space is introduced to describe the noncommutative r4
[12]. the purpose of this paper is to investigate this mechanism. it is shown that this
mechanism has rich structures, and gives insight in the short scale structures near the
core of instantons on noncommutative space. an important point is that the existence

1the case of equivariant instanton is studied in [14].
2in most part of this paper i use the term commutative with usual commutative r4 in mind, and ex-
plicitly refer to [13] when i compare our noncommutative descriptions to their commutative descriptions.

of the projection forces us to express gauge elds in reduced fock space where some of
the states have been projected out. it is shown that this modication of the fock space
corresponds to the modication of the spacetime topology.

an outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2, gauge theory on noncommutaive
space and the adhm construction on commutative r4 are briey reviewed. in section
3, the adhm construction on noncommutative r4 is studied. the reason why we must
consider the projections is explained. in section 4, the mechanism of the projections is
claried when the gauge group is u(1), utilizing nakajimas beautiful results [8][10]. in
section 5, it is demonstrated that the similar projections also occur in u(n) case.
in
section 6, embedding of the u(1) instanton solution to iib matrix model is considered.
the solution is understood as d-instantons within d3-brane in iib matrix model. it is
shown that the role of the projection is to remove anti-d-instantons and make holes on
d3-brane worldvolume.

when the previous version of this paper was at the nal stage of preparation, the paper
[13] appeared. some issues discussed in this paper have commutative counterparts in [13].
explanations on the modication of spacetime topology have been added after taking into
due consideration of the relation to their work.3

2 preliminaries

in this section we briey review the theory of gauge elds on noncommutative r4 and
adhm construction on commutative r4, as preliminaries to adhm construction on
noncommutative r4.

2.1 gauge fields on noncommutative r4
noncommutative r4 is described by an algebra generated by x ( = 1,   , 4) obeying
the commutation relations:

[x, x] = i,

(2.1)

where  is real and constant. in this paper we restrict ourselves to the case where 
is self-dual and set4

12 = 34 =


4

.

(2.2)

3i would like to thank n. nekrasov for explaining their work to me, and pointing out my misleading

statement in the concluding section in the earlier version of this paper.

4see [15] for the meaning of this choice of parameters in string theory.

2

then the algebra depends only one constant parameter .

introduce the generators of noncommutative c2  r4 by

z1 = x2 + ix1,

z2 = x4 + ix3 .

their commutation relations are:

[z1, z1] = [z2, z2] = 


2

,

(others: zero).

(2.3)

(2.4)

we choose  > 0 . the commutation relations (2.1) have a group of automorphisms of
the form x 7 x + c, where c is a commuting real number. we denote the lie algebra
of this group by g . following [12], we start with the algebra end h of operators acting
c|n1, n2i, where z, z are represented as creation and
in the fock space h = p(n1,n2)z2

annihilation operators:

0



s 2
s 2



z1 |n1, n2i = n1 + 1|n1 + 1, n2i , s 2
z2 |n1, n2i = n2 + 1|n1, n2 + 1i , s 2





z1 |n1, n2i = n1 |n1  1, n2i ,
z2 |n1, n2i = n2 |n1, n2  1i .

(2.5)

the algebra end h has a subalgebra of operators which have nite norm; we dene the
norm of operators by ||a|| := sup ||a||/||||; a  endh, |i 6= 0, |i  dom(a)  h.
dom(a) is a domain of operator a and |||| := h|i1/2. we denote this algebra by a.
whenever we consider the derivative of an operator a  a, we assume that it is also
contained in a, i.e. a  a ( is understood as the action of g = r4 on a by
translation). the u(n) gauge eld on noncommutative r4 is dened as follows. first we
consider n-dimensional vector space e := (a)n which carries a right representation of
a:

e  a  (e, a) 7 ea  e,

e(ab) = (ea)b,

e(a + b) = ea + eb,
(e + e)a = ea + ea,

(2.6)

for any e, e  e and a, b  a.5 the elements of e can be thought of as an n-dimensional
vector with entries in a. let us consider unitary action of u on the element of e:

e  ue,

(2.7)

where u is an nn matrix with its components in a, satisfying uu = uu = idhidn .
idh is an identity operator in a and idn is an n n identity matrix. under this unitary
transformation, de, the covariant derivative of e  e, is required to transform covariantly:
(2.8)

de  ude.
5e is a right module over a. see, for example, [31][32].

3

the covariant derivative d is written as

d = d + a.

(2.9)

here the u(n) gauge eld a is introduced to ensure the covariance, as explained below. a
is a matrix valued one-form: a = adx with a being an anti-hermitian n  n matrix.
the action of exterior derivative d is dened as:

da := (a) dx,

a  a.

(2.10)

dxs commute with x and anti-commute among themselves, and hence d2a = 0 for
a  a. from (2.7) and (2.8), the covariant derivative transforms as

hence the gauge eld a transforms as

d  udu.

the eld strength is dened by

a  udu + uau.

f := d2 = da + a2.

we can construct a gauge invariant action s by6

s = 

1
4g2 trh,u (n ) ff .

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

for later purpose, let us consider a projection operator p  mn (a), p  = p, p 2 = p ,
where mn (a) denotes the algebra of n  n matrices with their entries in a. for every
projection operator p , we can consider vector space pe:7
e  pe  e  e, e = p e

(2.15)

we can consider unitary action on pe:

e  up e,

up = p up = up p,
up up = up up = p.

we can construct covariant derivative dp for pe by

dp = p d + a, a = p a = ap.

6in this paper we only consider the case where the metric on r4 is at: g = .
7pe is a right projective module over a.

4

(2.16)

(2.17)

notice that dp = p dp . we require dp e to transform as

dp e  up dp e.

then the covariant derivative dp must transform as
dp  up dp up .

for any e  pe, one can show

up dp up e = up (p d + a)up e = up d(p (up e)) + up aup e

= up p dup e + p up (up de) + up aup e
= p de + (up dup + up aup )e.

(up p = p up )

hence the gauge transformation rule of the gauge eld a is given by

the eld strength becomes

a  up dup + up aup .

f := d2

p

= p da + a2 + p dp dp.

indeed, for e  pe, one can show

f e = (p d + a)(p de + ae)

= p d(p de) + p d(ae) + ap de + a2e
= p d(p de) + p dae + a2e,

and since e = p e and p 2 = p , we can rewrite (2.23) using following equations:

p d(p de) = p d(p d(p e))

= p d(p dp e + p de)
= p dp dp e  p dp de + p dp de
= p dp dp e.

hence we obtain (2.22). we can construct a gauge invariant action sp by

sp = 

1
4g2 trh,u (n ) p ff p.

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

gauge eld a is called anti-self-dual, or instanton, if its eld strength satises the

conditions:

where  is the hodge star.

(f + f ) = 0,

2.2 review of adhm construction on commutative r4

adhm construction [7] is the way to obtain anti-self-dual gauge eld on r4 from solutions
of some quadratic matrix equations. more specically, in order to construct anti-self-dual
u(n) gauge eld with instanton number k , one starts from the following data (adhm
data):

1. a pair of complex hermitian vector spaces v = ck and w = cn .

2. the operators b1, b2  hom(v, v ), i  hom(w, v ), j = hom(v, w ) satisfying

the equations

r = [b1, b1] + [b2, b2] + ii  jj = 0,
c = [b1, b2] + ij = 0.

next dene dirac-like operator dz : v  v  w  v  v by

z ! ,

dz =   z
z = ( b2  z2, b1  z1, i ),
z = ((b1  z1), b2  z2, j ).

(2.27) is equivalent to the set of equations

(2.27)

(2.28)

(2.29)
which are important conditions in adhm construction. there are n zero-modes of dz :
(2.30)

a = 1, . . . , n.

zz = 0,

zz = zz,

dz(a) = 0,

we can choose orthonormal basis of the space of zero-modes:

(a)(b) = ab.

(2.31)

the change of basis in the space of orthonormalized zero-modes (a) becomes u(n) gauge
symmetry. anti-self-dual u(n) gauge eld is constructed by the formula

aab = (a)d(b).

there is an action of u(k) that does not change (2.32) :
(b1, b2, i, j) 7 (gb1g1, gb2g1, gi, jg1),

g  u(k).

(2.32)

(2.33)

the moduli space of anti-self-dual u(n) gauge eld with instanton number k is given by

m(k, n) = 1

r (0)  1

c (0)/u(k),

(2.34)

where the action of u(k) is the one given in (2.33). when (b1, b2, i, j) is a xed point
of u(k) action, m(k, n) is singular. such a singularity corresponds to an instanton
shrinking to zero size.

6

3 adhm construction on noncommutative r4 and

the appearance of projection operator

the singularities in (2.34) has a natural resolution [8]. modify (2.27) to

r = [b1, b1] + [b2, b2] + ii  jj =  idv ,
c = [b1, b2] + ij = 0,

and consider the space

m(k, n) = 1

r ( idv )  1

c (0) /u(k).

(3.1)

(3.2)

then m(k, n) is a smooth 4kn dimensional hyper-kahler manifold. although the
absence of singularities is interesting from the physical point of view, construction of
instantons from (3.1) does not work straightforwardly. the main obstruction is that the
key equations in (2.29) are not satised on the usual commutative r4. however, nekrasov
and schwarz noticed that z and z do satisfy (2.29) if the coordinates are noncommutative
as in (2.4) [12]. once (2.29) is satised, we can expect that the construction of instantons
is similar to the usual commutative case. but there are some features peculiar to the
noncommutative case. especially, since the adhm construction on noncommutative r4
starts from (3.2) where small instanton singularities have been resolved, one expects that
crucial dierence will appear when the size of the instanton is small. it is interesting to
study such situations and see how the eects of noncommutativity appear.

the adhm construction on noncommutative r4 is as follows [12]. we dene operator

dz : (v  v  w )  a  (v  v )  a by the same formula (2.28):

z ! ,

dz =   z
z = ( b2  z2, b1  z1, i ),
z = ((b1  z1), b2  z2, j ).

the operator dzdz : (v  v )  a  (v  v )  a has a block diagonal form

dzdz =   z

0 z ! ,

0

z  zz = zz

(3.3)

(3.4)

which is a consequence of (2.29) and important for adhm construction. next we look
for solutions to the equation

dz(a) = 0 (a = 1, . . . , n),

(3.5)

7

where the components of (a) are operators: (a) : a  (v  v  w )  a. if we can
normalize (a)s as

(a)(b) ?= ab idh,

we can construct anti-self-dual u(n) gauge eld by the same formula (2.32):

where a and b are u(n) indices. then the eld strength becomes

aab = (a)d(b),

1 : cn  a  v  a,
2 : cn  a  v  a,
 : cn  a  w  a.

the derivation is similar to the commutative case. the eld strength in (3.8) is anti-self-
dual.

however, as we will see shortly, there are some states in h which are annihilated by
(a) for some a. more precisely, all the components of (a) annihilate those states. this
is not a special phenomenon, and the study of this phenomenon is the purpose of this
paper. let us consider the case where there is one such zero-mode (1). in that case we
cannot normalize (1) as in (3.6). we may normalize (1) as

(1)(1) = p,

(3.9)

where p  a is a projection operator that projects out the states annihilated by (1).
however, the projection operator gives additional contribution to the eld strength, be-
cause the projection operator depends on z and z.8 the derivative of the projection
operator gives additional contribution to the eld strength, which is not anti-self-dual.

the appearance of the projection operator p indicates that we should consider re-
stricted vector space pe rather than e. indeed, as we will see shortly, adhm construction
perfectly works in this setting.
8for example, |0, 0ih0, 0| =: e 2

 (z1 z1+z2 z2) : , where : : means normal ordering.

8

let us concentrate on the simplest u(1) case. the covariant derivative is given by the

formula (2.17):

dp = p d + a,

with a = p ap . the eld strength is given by (2.22):

f = p da + a2 + p dp dp.

we can construct anti-self-dual gauge eld by putting

a = dp,

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

where  is a zero-mode of dz and normalized as  = p . note that  = p . let us
check that (3.12) is really anti-self-dual. the rst term in (3.11) becomes

the last term above can be rewritten as

p da = p ddp  p ddp.

p ddp = p (d()  d)dp
= p dp dp  p ddp.

(3.13)

(3.14)

the rst term in (3.14) cancels p dp dp in (3.11). the last term in (3.14) vanishes when
acting on e = p e  pe, since dp p = p d(1  p )p = 0. the second term in (3.11)
becomes

a2 = p ddp

= p (d())  d)dp
= p dp d  p ddp.

(3.15)

the rst term in (3.15) vanishes because p dp  = p d(1  p )p  = 0. then the eld
strength becomes

f = p d(1  )dp
= p f adhmp = f adhm,

(3.16)

where f adhm is dened in (3.8) and is anti-self-dual. generalization to u(n) case is
straightforward.

the absence of the singular behavior in the eld conguration follows rather straight-
forwardly from the explicit formula (3.8). since we have normalized the zero-modes in the
subspace where zero-modes do not vanish, these normalized zero-modes are well dened.
moreover, as shown in appendix a, the operator z has no zero-mode and hence its in-
verse does not cause divergences. therefore from the explicit formula (3.8), we cannot
see any source of divergences in (3.8) or (3.16), either.

4 u (1) instantons and projection operators

4.1 projection operators in u (1) instanton solutions and rela-

tion to the ideal

in the previous section it is shown how to construct anti-self-dual gauge eld when the
zero-mode annihilates some states. then the natural question is: how the states an-
nihilated by the zero-modes should be determined?  in this section the answer to this
question is given when the gauge group is u(1).
let us consider the solution to the equation

dz |ui = 0,

(4.1)

where |ui  hk  hk  h, i.e. the components of |ui are vectors in the fock space
h. we call |ui vector zero-mode and call  in (3.5) operator zero-mode. we can
construct operator zero-mode if we know all the vector zero-modes. the advantage of
considering vector zero-modes is that we can relate them to the ideal discussed in [9][10].
the point is that we can regard vector zero-modes as holomorphic vector bundle described
in purely commutative terms. noncommutativity appears when we construct operator
zero-mode treating all the vector zero-modes as a whole.

let us write

|ui = 


|u1i
|u2i
| f i

,




|u1i  u1(z1, z2)| 0, 0i
|u2i  u2(z1, z2)| 0, 0i
| f i  f (z1, z2)| 0, 0i

(4.2)

where |u1i ,|u2i  hk i.e. they are vectors in v = ck and vectors in h, and | f i  h.

the space of the solutions of (4.1) , i.e. ker dz = ker z  ker z  ker z/im z

i = n f (z1, z2) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

f (b1, b2) = 0 o,

(4.3)

where b1 and b2 together with i and j give a solution to (3.1). in u(1) case, one can
show j = 0, and the isomorphism is given by the inclusion of the third factor in (4.2)
[9][10].

10

let us dene ideal state by

|i  ideal states of i  f (z1, z2)  i,

|i = f (z1, z2)|0, 0i ,

(4.5)

and denote the space of all the ideal states by hi. we dene h/i
orthogonal to hi :

10 as a subspace in h

|gi  h/i  f (z1, z2)  i,

h0| f(z1, z2)|gi = 0.

(4.6)

h/i is a k dimensional space [10]. let us denote the complete basis of h/i by | g i ,  =
1, 2,   , k, and the orthonormalized complete basis of hi by | fi i , i = k + 1, k + 2,  .
they altogether span the complete basis of h. we can label them by positive integer n :
(4.7)

{ | hn i , n  z+} = { | g i , | fi i ,  = 1, 2,   , k, i = k + 1, k + 2,   }.

as we can see from (4.4), zero-modes (4.1) are completely determined by the ideal fi(z1, z2)
[10]:

|u(fi)i = 


|u1(fi)i
|u2(fi)i
| fi i

.




we can construct operator zero-mode (3.5) by the following formula:

 = xi xn

()in |u(fi)ihhn| ,

(4.8)

(4.9)

where ()in is a commuting number. from (4.9), one can see that there are innitely many
operator zero-modes. since the fock space h is divided into two orthogonal subspaces hi
and h/i through the isomorphism (4.3), it is natural to restrict the action of operators
to hi. we call 0 minimal operator zero-mode if it has the form:
|fji  hi,

(0)ij |u(fi)ihfj| ,

0 = xi,j
j, i

such that

(0)ij 6= 0,

(4.10)

(0)in = 0 for n =  = 1, 2,   , k. we call it normalized minimal operator

i.e.
zero-mode if it is normalized in hi:

00 = pi,

(4.11)

where pi is a projection operator which represents the projection to hi, the space of
ideal states. the uniqueness of the normalized minimal operator zero-mode (up to gauge
10the meaning of this notation is as follows: h/i corresponds to c[z1, z2]/i, where c[z1, z2] is the

ring of polynomials of z1, z2.

11

transformation) is shown in appendix b. this means that the normalized minimal oper-
ator zero-mode containes minimal information of the ideal (4.3). from above denition,
minimal operator zero-mode annihilates states in h/i, i.e. 0 |i = 0 for |i  h/i. note
that if we write

0 = 


1
2


,




(4.12)

then  |i = 0  1 |i = 2 |i = 0. hence the states annihilated by minimal operator
zero-mode 0 are completely determined by the third factor  in (4.12).

an interesting point is that the noncommutative operators appear from the ideal
described in purely commutative terms, by treating innite number of the elements of
ideal simultaneously.

as an illustration, let us construct u(1) one-instanton solution from the ideal. first,
let us recall u(1) one-instanton solution constructed in [12]. the solution to the modied
adhm equations (3.1) is given by

(4.13)

.

(4.14)

(z1z1 + z2 z2)




b1 = b2 = 0,

i = q , j = 0.

there is a solution 0 to the equation dz 0 = 0 :

0 =

notice that all the components of 0 annihilate |0, 0i . as a consequence 0
0 = (z1z1 +
z2 z2)(z1z1 +z2 z2 +) annihilates |0, 0i. therefore the inverse of (z1 z1 +z2z2) is only dened
in the subspace of fock space where |0, 0i is projected out:

(z1z1 + z2 z2)1 := p (z1z1 + z2 z2)1p,

where p is a projection operator that project out |0, 0i:

therefore

p = idh  |0, 0ih0, 0| .

0 = 0( 0

is normalized as 00 = p .

let us reconstruct this zero-mode from ideal. the ideal which corresponds to (4.13)
is i = (z1, z2). the basis vector of the h/i is |0, 0i which is orthogonal to all the ideal

12

states. we can use |n1, n2i , (n1, n2) 6= (0, 0) as basis vectors of hi , the space of ideal
states. the solutions of dz |ui = 0 are given by

(n1, n2) 6= (0, 0).

from (4.18), we obtain operator zero-mode dz = 0 :

()(m1,m2)(n1,n2) |um1m2ihn1, n2| ,

the normalized minimal operator zero-mode 0 is required to satisfy

0 = x(m1,m2)6=(0,0) x(n1,n2)6=(0,0)
00 = idh  |0, 0ih0, 0| .

()(m1,m2)(n1,n2) |um1m2ihn1, n2| ,

from the normalization condition in (4.20), we obtain

(4.22)

(4.20) and (4.22) are equivalent to (4.14) and (4.17).

4.2 some u (1) instanton solutions

the construction of operator zero-mode from vector zero-modes is useful for understanding
the notion of minimal operator zero-mode. but in some simple cases it is easier to directly
look for the operator zero-modes. it is interesting to observe that the obtained operator
zero-modes which are most naturally obtained really annihilate states in h/i.

u (1) two-instanton solution11

let us study the two-instanton solutions degenerating at the origin. the corresponding
solution to the matrix equations (3.1) is given by

b1 =   0 1

0 ! , b2 =   0 2

0

0 ! , i =   0

2 ! , j = 0.

0

(4.23)

11although we only consider solutions of matrix equation (3.1) and do not construct gauge eld ex-
plicitly, we call the solutions instanton solutions because in principle we can construct instantons from
the matrix data. we regard k as a number of instantons.

13

where 1 and 2 are complex numbers satisfying |1|2 + |2|2 = 1 . notice that b1 and
b2 are upper half triangle matrices. 1, 2 (partially) remember the direction before two
instantons collide [10][20]. the corresponding ideal is i = (z2
1, 2z1 + 1z2). hence the
states orthogonal to all the ideal states are annihilated by z2
1, 2 z1 + 1z2. the states
annihilated by z2
1 is |0, n2i , |1, n2i for all non-negative integer n2. in order to describe the
states annihilated by 2 z1 + 1 z2, it is simpler to use the basis constructed by rotated
creation and annihilation operators z and z:

z2  2z1 + 1z2,

z1  1z1 + 2z2,
|0, 0i = |0, 0i ,
s 2
s 2





z1 |n1, n2i = qn1 + 1|n1 + 1, n2i , s 2
z2 |n1, n2i = qn2 + 1|n1, n2 + 1i , s 2





z1 |n1, n2i = qn1 |n1  1, n2i ,
z2 |n1, n2i = qn2 |n1, n2  1i .

(4.24)

then the states annihilated by z2 = 2z1 + 1z2 are |n1, 0i for all non-negative n1 .
therefore the basis vectors of the states orthogonal to all the ideal states are |0, 0i ,|1, 0i
now let us study operator zero-mode. the (unnormalized) minimal operator zero-mode
can be directly obtained from (4.23):

5 u (n ) instantons and projection operators

in the previous section we have claried the notion of the minimal operator zero-mode
for u(1) case. in this section we will study the u(2) instanton solutions and observe that
the projection of states by zero-modes also occurs. since the u(n) instanton solutions
are essentially embeddings of u(2) instanton solutions to u(n), this means that the
projection of states is a general phenomenon in the adhm construction of instantons on
noncommutative r4. in the following, we will make two observations:

1. the minimal operator zero-mode appears in the u(1) subgroup of u(2) gauge group.

it annihilates some states even when the size of instanton is not small.

2. when the size of instanton becomes small, only the contribution from u(1) subgroup

described by the minimal operator zero-mode remains.

although we have not dened minimal operator zero-mode for u(n) case, zero-modes sim-
ilar to the minimal operator zero-mode in u(1) case appear in explicit solutions. hence in
the above we have also called them minimal operator zero-modes. the second observation
can be understood as follows. we may dene small instanton on noncommutative r4
as j = 0 solution of the modied adhm equations (3.1). then the solution is essentially
the embedding of u(1) instanton to u(n).

u (2) one-instanton solution

the solution to the modied adhm equations (3.1) is given by13

b1 = b2 = 0,

i = (cid:16) 2 +  0 (cid:17) ,

j = (cid:16) 0  (cid:17) ,

(5.1)

where  is a real non-negative number and parameterizes the size of the instanton. the
two orthonormalized operator zero-modes of dz are given by

13there are of course family of solutions with dierent orientation in gauge group u (2). the resulting

conclusions are the same.

16

the zero-mode (1) is a straightforward modication of (4.17). (1) annihilates |0, 0i
for any values of , and normalized in the subspace where |0, 0i is projected out. the
zero-mode (2) annihilates no state in h and manifestly non-singular even if  = 0. when
 = 0, (2)
2 = 0 , and from (3.8) (2) does not contribute to the eld strength.
therefore the structure of the instanton at  = 0 is completely determined by the u(1)
subgroup described by minimal operator zero-mode (1).

1 = (2)

u (2) two-instanton solution

we can also construct a two-instanton solution and check the statements in the beginning
of this section. here we only construct one simple solution. the solution of modied

6 d-instanton makes a hole on d3-brane

the existence of the projection operator forces us to consider the reduced fock space. in
this section it is shown that the projection can be interpreted as modication of space-
time topology. usual yang-mills theory cannot describe such spacetime topology change.
however, as we will see shortly, iib matrix model [3][4] gives an appropriate framework.
the action of the iib matrix model is obtained by dimensionally reducing ten-dimensional
u(n) super yang-mills theory down to zero dimension:14

s = 

1

g2 tr(cid:18)1

4

[x, x][x , x ] +

1
2

[x , ](cid:19) ,

(6.1)

where x and  are n  n hermitian matrices and each component of  is a majorana-
weyl spinor. the action (6.1) has the following n = 2 supersymmetry:

(1) =

i
2

[x, x](1),

(1)x = i(1),
(2) = (2),
(2)x = 0.

the classical equation of motion is given by

iib matrix model has classical d-brane solutions:

[x, [x, x]] = 0.

x = i ,
[i , i ] = ib ,

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

where bs are real constants. hereafter we will consider (euclidean) d3-brane solution,
i.e. the rank of b is four and b = 0 when ,  6= 1, 2, 3, 4. we dene coordinate
matrices x by

x = i ,

(6.5)

where  is an inverse matrix of b. then their commutation relations are the same as
those in (2.1):

14we have slightly changed the notations from those in the previous sections: in this section n denotes
the rank of the gauge group of iib matrix model. we will only consider u (1) instantons in the following.

[x, x] = i.

(6.6)

18

hence by setting  (or equivalently b) self-dual as in (2.2), i.e. 12 = 34 = 
4 , and
replacing operators to innite rank matrices,15 we can embed the instanton solution (3.12)
to iib matrix model:

x = p (i  + ia)p

where a is the u(1) instanton solution obtained by adhm construction:

a = [ , ]p,

(6.7)

(6.8)

where  is a zero-mode (3.5). p is the projection operator determined by the zero-mode,
as described in section 4. from (6.7) the solution can be represented within reduced
c(p |n1, n2i). therefore the solution is realized by n  n
fock space ph := p(n1,n2)z2
matrices with n = (dimh  k), where k is an instanton number. notice that in (6.7)
instanton and geometry(d3-brane) are combined into single solution.
indeed, we can
rewrite (6.7) into simpler form:

0

x = p (i  + ia)p

= p (i )p + p (i )p  p (ip )p
= ip  p = i .

from (6.7) we obtain

[x, x] = p (ib  f adhm)p.

(6.9)

(6.10)

the derivation is similar to (3.12)  (3.16) and f adhm is anti-self-dual. from (6.10) it
is easy to check that x in (6.9) solves the equation of motion (6.3).

let us consider the supersymmetry transformation in this background:

(1) =

=

i
2
i
2

[x, x](1)

p (ib  f adhm

1 + 5

2

)p (1),

(2) = (2).

(6.11)

from (6.11) we can see that the solution (6.7) preserves one fourth of supersymmetry [4]:

5(1) = (1),

(2) = 

1
2

p bp (1).

(6.12)

notice that the projection operator is an identity operator in the reduced fock space ph.
hence the second supersymmetry transformation is proportional to the identity matrix
in u(n) iib matrix model, with n = dimh  k.
15(6.4) is not satised in u (n ) iib matrix model with nite n .

19

the physical interpretation of the projection in this setting is as follows. the b
in (6.4) is interpreted as ns-ns b-eld on d3-brane worldvolume [4]. we have set b
self-dual. since the self-dual b-eld on d3-brane induces negative d-instanton charge,16
we can regard that the d3-brane is made of innitely many constituent anti-d-instantons.
now let us consider d-instantons within these innite number of anti-d-instantons. in
order for this conguration to become bps, it is necessary to change the congurations
of constituent anti-d-instantons. the projection removes anti-d-instantons at the place
of d-instantons and makes holes on d3-brane worldvolume.

we can express the holes made by the projections by rewriting above operator for-
mulas using ordinary functions and star-product. more precisely, we map operators
17 for example, consider the projection corre-
to normal symbols (see appendix c).
sponding to the ideal i generated by (z1  wi
2) (i = 1,   , k). then, all nor-
mal symbols corresponding to operators acting in the reduced fock space endph van-
ish at (z1, z2) = (wi
2) (i = 1,   , k). this can be equivalently stated as the points
(z1, z2) = (wi

2) (i = 1,   , k) do not exist, or appear as holes.

using operator symbols, one can show that the projection removes k units of anti-
d-instanton charge. let us calculate (anti-)instanton number when there are no d-
instantons. using (c.4),

(6.13)

since the projection reduces dimension of fock space by k, it reduces k units of anti-d-
instanton charge (of course there are also contributions from anti-self-dual part. here
we only mention the role of the projection). this fact also supports the idea that the
projection removes anti-d-instantons.

conclusions and speculations

conclusions

in this paper we have learned that the appearance of projection operators is a general
phenomenon in the adhm construction on noncommutative r4.
it has been shown
how to treat these projections. the existence of the projection operator forces us to

16our convention is: d-instanton  instanton  anti-self-dual .
17here we use normal symbols only to give concrete expressions of holes on r4  c2.

it may be
interesting to formulate eld theory on noncommutative r4 using normal symbols.
it may be also
interesting to investigate the relation to superstring theory. these are, however, beyond the scope of this
paper .

20

consider gauge elds on reduced fock space. since noncommutative r4 is dened by
algebra over whole fock space, the projection means the change of the spacetime topology
from (noncommutative) r4. in order to describe such change of spacetime topology, it
seems appropriate to consider theory which can describe both gauge theory and geometry.
therefore we have embeded the instanton solution to iib matrix model. in iib matrix
model, instanton and geometry are combined into single classical solution.

speculations
in [13] it was conjectured that the u(1) instanton on noncommutative r4  c2 can be
transformed to u(1) instanton on commutative kahler manifold which is a blowup of c2,
via eld redenition described in [15]. the ideal used to describe projection in this paper
is essentially the same as the one used to describe blowup in [13]. since both instantons
are constructed from the same adhm data, the correspondence is of course one-to-one.
it is interesting if this correspondence is understood as eld redenition along the lines of
[15].

in section 6 we have embeded instanton solutions to iib matrix model. instantons on
noncommutative r4 represent d-instantons within d3-brane worldvolume. we interpret
d3-brane as bound states of innitely many anti-d-instantons. then the bound states of
d-instantons and d3-brane are interpreted as bound states of d-instantons and anti-d-
instantons. as shown in (6.11) and (6.12), this co-existence of positive and negative d-
instanton charges still preserves one fourth of supersymmetry. however, anti-d-instantons
are removed at the place of d-instantons. this fact strongly suggests the relation to brane-
anti-brane pair annihilation [27]. iib matrix model describe above d-instanton-d3-brane
bound states simply as its classical solution. this fact indicates the power of iib matrix
model in the description of the fate of brane-anti-brane unstable systems.
it is also
straightforward to embed the noncommutative instanton solution to bfss matrix model.
it is interesting to study the instanton solution in iib matrix model or bfss matrix model
from the point of view of brane-anti-brane pair annihilation [28]. in order to classify the
topological charges which will be preserved during pair annihilations, investigations from
k-theoretical viewpoints may be important [29][30].

from above considerations, d3-brane may be regarded as a kind of dirac sea for

d-instantons. this gives new viewpoints to the second quantization of branes [20][21].

a the absence of zero-mode of z

in this section we show that z in (3.4) has no zero-mode. suppose

for some |vi , where |vi  hk , i.e. |vi is vector in v = ck and vector in h. then,

z |vi = 0

(a.1)

hv| z |vi = 0

 hv| zz |vi

= hv| (b1  z1)(b1  z1)|vi + hv| (b2  z2)(b2  z2)|vi + hv| ii |vi = 0,
hv| zz |vi
= hv| (b1  z1)(b1  z1)|vi + hv| (b2  z2)(b2  z2)|vi + hv| jj |vi = 0.

(a.2)

since the norm of vectors in v are non-negative,

(b1  z1)|vi = 0,
(b1  z1)|vi = 0,

(b2  z2)|vi = 0,
(b2  z2)|vi = 0,

i |vi = 0,
j |vi = 0.

from (a.3), we obtain

hv|  |vi = hv| [b1, b1] + [b2, b2] + ii  jj |vi

= hv| [z1, z1] + [z2, z2]|vi
= hv|  |vi .

this means |vi = 0.

(a.3)

(a.4)

b the uniqueness of the normalized minimal

operator zero-mode

in this appendix we show the uniqueness of the normalized minimal operator zero-mode
(up to gauge transformation) when the gauge group is u(1). let us consider operator
zero-mode which has the following form:

0 = xi,j

(0)ij |u(fi)ihfj| .

then its norm is:

00 = x(0)ik(0)lj |fiihu(fk)|u(fl)ihfj| ,

22

(b.1)

(b.2)

where

hu(fk)|u(fl)i = hu1(fk)|u1(fl)i + hu2(fk)|u2(fl)i + hfk|fli .

let us rewrite the equation dz |u(fi)i = 0 as

d u(fi) = fi,

where

(b.3)

(b.4)

d =   b2  z2

|u2(fi)i ! ,
(b1  z1) b2  z2 ! , u(fi) =   |u1(fi)i

b1  z1

fi =   |fii i

0 ! .

(b.5)

since the correspondence between the elements of ideal and vector zero-modes is one-to-
one, we can consider the inverse operator of d:

then, (b.3) can be written as

u(fi) = 

1
d

fi.

hu(fk)|u(fl)i
= u(fk) u(fl) + fk fl = fk (cid:18) 1
= hfk| i(cid:18)(cid:18) 1
+ 1(cid:19) i |fli ,

dd(cid:19)1 1

dd

+ 1(cid:19) fl

where we denote the components of (dd)1 as

(dd)1 =   (dd)1

1 1
(dd)1
2 1

(dd)1
1 2
(dd)1

2 2 ! .

(b.6)

(b.7)

(b.8)

from (b.7), the matrix ckl = hu(fk)|u(fl)i has no zero-eigenvalue-vector and we can
consider (c1)kl. the normalized minimal operator zero-mode is uniquely determined
(up to phase factor):

(0)ij = (c1/2)ij.

(b.9)

c calculations by the method of operator symbols

one can represent the equations over the algebra a by mapping operators to ordinary
c-number functions (operator symbols) and using star product. some calculations become
simpler by the use of operator symbols. the map from operators to ordinary functions
depends on operator ordering procedures.
in order to express holes on d3-brane (see
section 6), we utilize normal symbol which corresponds to the normal ordering. here we

23

review this normal symbol. for more detailed arguments on the operator symbols, see for
example [33] and references therein. in this appendix, we use  to denote the operators:
xs are noncommutative operators and xs are c-number coordinates of r4.

let us consider normal ordered operator of the form

f (x) = z

d4k
(2)4

f (k) : eikx : ,

(c.1)

where kx := k x.
(c.1), the corresponding normal symbol is dened by

: : denotes the normal ordering. for the operator valued function

fn(x) = z

d4k
(2)4

f (k) eikx ,

(c.2)

where xs are commuting coordinates of r4. we dene n as a map from operators to
the normal symbols:

n ( f (x)) = fn(x) := z

from the denition (c.6), the star product is associative:

(f (x) n g(x) ) n h(x) = f (x) n (g(x) n h(x) ).

(c.10)

if we use coherent states, the expression of the normal symbol becomes simpler. the
coherent states |z1, z2i are eigen states of annihilation operators z1, z2:

z1 |z1, z2i = z1 |z1, z2i ,
z2 |z1, z2i = z2 |z1, z2i .

then the normal symbol of operator f is given by

fn(z, z) = hz1, z2| f |z1, z2i .

(c.12) follows from (c.1),(c.2) and

hz1, z2| : eikx : |z1, z2i = hz1, z2| e wzewz |z1, z2i = e wzewz

= eikx,

(c.11)

(c.12)

(c.13)

(we have normalized the coherent states as hz1, z2 |z1, z2i = 1). from (c.12) it is easy to
see that the normal symbol fn(z, z) vanishes at (z1, z2) when the corresponding operator
f annihilates |z1, z2i or hz1, z2|, i.e.

f |z1, z2i = 0 or hz1, z2| f = 0 = fn(z, z) = 0.
