abstract

the worldline casting of a gauge eld system with spin-1/2 matter elds has pro-
vided a, particle-based, rst quantization formalism in the framework of which the
bern-kosower algorithms for ecient computations in qcd acquire a simple inter-
pretation. this paper extends the scope of applicability of the worldline scheme so
as to include open fermionic paths. specic algorithms are established which address
themselves to the fermionic propagator and which are directly applicable to any other
process involving external fermionic states. it is also demonstrated that in this frame-
work the sole agent of dynamics operating in the system is the wilson line (loop)
operator, which makes a natural entrance in the worldline action; everything else is
associated with geometrical properties of particle propagation, of which the most im-
portant component is polyakovs spin factor.

1. introduction

consider a gauge theory with spin-1/2 matter elds, in the dening representation of the
symmetry group, described by a standard (renormalizable) lagrangian density. a worldline
transcription of such a system is based, after a wick rotation to euclidean space-time, on a re-

casting of the form r d(x) d(x) es[(x),(x),a(x)]...  r dx( ) dp( ) es[x( ),p( ),a(x( ))]...

according to which the matter elds register as point-like objects whose propagation (in
phase-space) is furnished by a path integral. to the extent that the functional integration
over the fermionic elds is gaussian (in the grassmann sense), nothing is lost, in principle,
from the content of the original system through the above transcription. pioneering work
that dealt systematically with the subject appears in refs [1-3].

more recent advancements in worldline methodology, especially in connection to gauge
theories, have been made, independently, by fried [4-6], strassler [7] and our group [8-
12]. respective methodological tools adopted by the above authors are: (a) schwingers
functional calculus formalism [13], (b) the string-inspired computational algorithms of bern
and kosower [14] and (c) polyakovs description of the propagation of particle-like excitations
in (euclidean) space-times [15]. concerning specic objectives and/or applications aspired
to by these attempts, the following rough picture emerges. fried and collaborators [4-6]
as well as the present authors and collaborators [10-12] have so far focused their eorts on
eikonal-type descriptions in gauge eld theories (with qcd as the ultimate target), along
with associated issues such as scattering amplitudes at asymptotically large collision energies,
factorization of soft physics, heavy quark eective theories, etc. in strasslers case, on the
other hand, emphasis from the beginning was placed on the development of new, more
ecient rules for performing loop calculations in pqcd as per the realizations of ref [14].
a key aspect of the polyakov-inspired approach, that we have been advocating, is its
ability to accentuate geometrical features of particle-like propagation in space-time. to
illustrate this occurrence consider, rst, the direct performance of the path integration over
dp( )1. adhering to the use of the rst order form for the dirac operator we were able
[9] to reproduce polyakovs spin factor which characterizes the closed path propagation of a
spin-1/2 particle-like entity in euclidean space-time. this quantity has a purely geometrical
content (it is, in some sense, associated with torsion) and accounts in a self-consistent way,
for the re-entry of a closed (euclidean) space-time contour by the spin-1/2 particle. by
contrast, all other approaches to worldline descriptions have adopted the second order form
for the dirac operator which forces a, conventional type, spin-dependent term of the form
f  in the worldline action. our rst undertaking, in this paper, is to establish a direct
connection between polyakovs geometric spin-factor and the dynamical   f term.

a second consequence resulting from our approach is its adaptation to congurations
involving open worldline contours. in physical terms this means that we are in a position
to extend our considerations to processes wherein spin-1/2 entities enter as external particle
states2. by contrast, strasslers applications pertain to n-point functions with gauge eld

1in fact, the characterization worldline strictly applies to the resulting structure which, through this

integration, formulates itself in coordinate space.

2it is in this context that common grounds have been established with the eikonal-based work of fried
[4-6], who employs schwingers functional calculus as methodological tool and explicitly accommodates spin
through the   f term.

modes as external states which attach themselves to a fermionic loop [7]. the major part
of our present eort is to extend worldline computational algorithms, hitherto provided
for diagrams involving fermionic loops, to ones wherein open fermionic paths make their
entrance.

our ultimate hope is that, through the present work, the elegant separation between
purely geometrical properties of matter particle paths, on the one hand, and dynamics, on
the other, will emerge as one of the most potent aspects of the worldline casting of gauge eld
theories. leaving the elucidation of this remark to an a posteriori discussion, let us proceed
to exhibit the organization of the present paper. in the next section we display worldline
expressions which will form the basis of our subsequent considerations. we shall proceed,
in section 3, to make the connection between the dynamical   f term, appearing in the
worldline action as a result of adopting the second order form for the dirac operator and
the geometrical polyakovs spin factor. this is accomplished via a fortuitous application
of an area derivative operator acting on functionals [16,17]. section 4 constitutes a central
part of our paper. specically, we undertake the task of carrying out the procedure that will
lead to an explicit worldline formula for the fermionic greens function to second order in its
perturbative expansion. a major aspect of this attempt is to present an expression which
employs super-particle coordinates, i.e. a path integral description which uses both bosonic
and fermionic variables. we proceed, in section 5, to discuss computational tools which are
involved in practical applications of the worldlike scheme. a rst such undertaking is carried
out in section 6 where we establish, to second order, the equivalence between the feynman
diagrammatic and worldline perturbative expansions of the fermionic propagator in a non-
abelian gauge theory. a direct one loop calculation is performed in section 7; it produces a
nal expression in parametrized form which is ready to enter perturbative estimates of higher
order greens functions with external fermion (as well as gauge eld) legs. our concluding
remarks are presented in section 8, while some technical matters pertaining to the work in
section 7 are displayed in an appendix.

2. basic worldline expressions

in this section we shall discuss worldline formulas placing emphasis on fermionic greens
functions in a background of, non-abelian in general, gauge elds. we shall work in euclidean
space-time in the context of which the spin-factor can be dened. special emphasis will be
placed on the second order dirac formalism as our immediate aim (cf. next section) is to
establish its connection with the spin-factor.

let us commence our considerations with a short presentation of previous results stem-
ming from the employment of the rst order dirac operator. a systematic procedure which
takes one from the original eld theoretical casting of the system to worldline formulas can be
found in [9]. here we shall proceed formally. consider, rst, the eective action functional,
with dependence on the background gauge eld. its formal expression is

w [a] = ln det[i  d  (m  i)], d =  + iga.

(1)

using schwingers proper time representation [18] and going to euclidean space-time we

computation of the non-dirac  matrix as well as non-color part of the trace in coordinate

describing the orientation tensor of the local, perpendicular to the path, plane.

as already mentioned, our main preoccupation in this paper will be with fermionic
greens functions (propagators) whose denition involves open paths. to begin, let us dis-
cuss worldline expressions for the fermionic greens function, in a (non-abelian) gauge eld
background. we rst consider the case where the rst order form for the dirac operator is
adopted. the corresponding schwinger proper time formula for the greens operator is

ig[a] = z 

0

dt et (d+m).

its worldline representation, in phase-space, reads

ig(x, y|a) = z de( )z dh( )z x(0)=x

(7)

the integral over dh( ) on the right hand side supplies our commitment to a choice of
gauge with respect to the reparametrization invariance requirement. the latter, corresponds
f ( ) > 0, f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1, under which we have
to the transformation   t = f ( ),
e( )  f( )e(t), x( )  f ( ) x(t) and h( )  1
f ( )

h(t).

the second order formalism for the dirac operator, on the other hand, bases itself on the

operator expression

ig[a] = (  d + m)z

3we are here referring to a gauge choice with respect to parametrization invariance and mass identication.

our immediate objective is to recast the above expression into a form where the open-line
analogue of the spin-factor replaces the   f term. the relevant work will be carried out in
the following section.

3. spin-factor in the second order formalism

we commence our considerations which will lead to the recasting of the   f term in (13)
by utilizing the area derivative operator for path dependent functionals. we shall follow,
in this respect, polyakovs proposal [16] for practical reasons. a geometrical denition has
been given by migdal [17]. let us, then, introduce the operator (area derivative) by

even though the term spin-factor per se pertains, as a geometrical quantity, to closed paths,
we shall employ, from hereon, this nomenclature for the expression given by eq. (4) even
when it enters quantities dened on open paths, such as the above.

sion, in the second order formalism, is

for a proper choice of gauge the above result matches the one that has been obtained
[9] through the rst order formalism, cf. eq. (3). the notable accomplishment resulting
from the manipulations that have just been carried out is an apparent dissociation of a
geometrical feature (cf. spin-factor), characterizing the propagation of particle-like modes,
from the dynamics operating in the system. the latter seem to be exclusively carried out

where the expectation value in the gauge eld sector includes gauge xing terms, ghost

generalizing, we infer that, in the worldline language, quantities of theoretical interest,
such as n-point greens functions and generating functionals, draw all dynamical input from
expectation values of wilson lines or loops. such objects have been extensively studied in
the past, see, for example, [16, 19-23]. any possible non-perturbative application of the
present formalism will, therefore, be greatly facilitated by relevant, accumulated knowledge.
even though eq. (23) will serve as the starting point for our subsequent considerations,
we nd it useful to recast it in a form which adopts particle-based coordinates. along with
practical consequences, this will facilitate a direct comparison with strasslers (closed path)
worldline expressions. we shall devote the remainder of the present section to this task.

this is an essentially new result which not only extends strasslers expressions to open
fermionic lines but encodes spin eects through a geometrical quantity entering a particle-
based action functional. at the same time it underlines the role of the wilson line operator
as the sole agent of the dynamics operating in the system. the spin factor, in other words,
has joined the rest of the path-dependent (super) coordinates to account for particle-based

7

characteristics of spin-1/2 matter eld propagation. generalizations of spin factor expres-
sions pertaining to higher spins have been discussed, from a dierent viewpoint, in ref [24].
the bottom line is that the spin factor accounts for geometrical features of paths induced
on them by the nature of the particle-like entity which traverses them.

mention should be made, at this point, of the attempt in ref [25] to tackle the problem
of open line propagation of spin-1/2 particles in a gauge eld background. the relevant
methodology has a dierent philosophy (analytical rather than geometrical) and restricts
itself to situation wherein the gauge eld(s) do not acquire a dynamical character, i.e. they
remain external. by staying faithful to polyakovs geometric point of view [15], on the other
hand, we have both attained simplicity in form of worldline expressions while achieving, at
the same time, extensions beyond the free particle case.

the corresponding expression for the eective action functional is

the above equation corresponds to strasslers result, modulo the presence of the spin-
factor term in place of   f . it serves as the starting point for computational rules involving
quark loops. the relevant particle-based action can be read o the above formulas and has
as follows

(31)

where the z-elds serve to enforce path ordering when background elds are present.

note that under the supersymmetric transformation x = i ,  =  x the rst
two terms in (31) remain invariant whilst the last two do not. on the other hand, we can
easily retrieve the   f term, by partial integration, from the spin-factor. this brings us
right back to the strassler form for the worldline action which is supersymmetric invariant5.
we shall refer to (31) as super-worldline particle action.

4. analytic manipulations with the spin factor: fermionic prop-

agator to 2nd order

besides its interpretational appeal as a geometrical agent that accounts for the spin of
a propagating particle, the spin factor presents practical advantages as it actually expedites
analytic manipulations involved in the computation of fermionic greens functions and ef-
fective action functionals. samples of the latter case have been given in [9]. here we focus
our eorts on calculations pertaining to fermionic propagators.

5note that supersymmetry appears to be manifestly broken in (31) due to the boundary conditions

involved in the partial integration which produced the spin factor.

8

4a. general considerations

according to the resulting expressions in the previous section the spin factor expression
combines bosonic with fermionic particle-based coordinates. suppose we were to expand
the relevant exponential. we would then nd ourselves having to compute expectation
values in the bosonic sector of the type < ( x( )x( )  x( ) x( ))... >x. clearly, the
only way to get a non-null result is for a four-vector, say k, to make its entrance so that,
in combination with the four-vector (x  y) which will emerge from the path integration,
would facilitate the creation of antisymmetric combinations. equivalently, unless the rst
derivative is discontinuous at some  = i the aforementioned expectation value terms, once
recast the form < ( x( ) x( +) x( ) x( ))... >x (  0), would lead to a vanishing
result except at points where a force acts, thereby injecting a four-momentum k on the
fermionic line.

consider the situation where m such points i are present on a given fermionic line. let

us set

1
2

[ x(i + )  x(i  )] = lim0 iki,

i = 1, ..., m.

(32)

we surmise (here c denotes an open curve)

d ( )( )[x( ) x( )  x( ) x( )#

(33)

momentum conservation can be taken into account by setting pm

clearly, m measures the number of points where a gauge eld is applied on a given
fermionic path6. this means that m coincides with the perturbative order to which one
expands the wilson line in a given worldline expression such as, e.g., (29).

i=1 ki = 0.

let us now return to the expansion of the exponential that furnishes the spin factor, only

this time we focus on its fermionic component. from eq (26) we determine

< ( )( ) >=

1
2

.

(34)

this means that any term in the expansion of order greater than m will inevitably lead
to mixtures of symmetric and antisymmetric factors, hence a vanishing contribution to the
propagator. so, not only is m associated with perturbative order but also sets a bound on
the contributing terms in the expansion of the spin factor.

armed with the above concrete as well as of practical value realizations, we are in position
to turn our attention to the 2nd order expression of the fermionic greens function and gain
specic insights with respect to spin factor contributions to its worldline form. this is
precisely the task that we shall carry out in the next subsection.

4b. spin factor contribution to the second order fermionic greens function

6it is in this context that an earlier comment, to the eect that the computation of the spin-factor

expression requires dynamical input, was made.

focusing our attention on the spin-factor expression, let us consider the rst order term,
to be denoted by (1), in its expansion. according to the general discussion of the previous
subsection we determine

(1) =

t

2 xi=1,2

(i)(i)[iki x(i)  iki x(i)].

(36)

setting k2 = k1 = k we obtain

(1) =

t

(2)(2)[ik x(1)  ik x(1)]

t
2

(1)(1)[ik x(2)  ik x(2)].

(37)

consider, next, the path integration over the  elds. according to (34) the contribution
from the above terms is zero. had our computation referred to the eective action functional
w [a] this would be the end of the story, as far as path integration over the fermionic
coordinates is concerned. for the greens function, on the other hand, a four-spinor factor
also appears for which we determine (we keep only the antisymmetric contribution, under
the exchange   )

2 < (t )(t )(i)(i) >= 

1
2

[  ],

i = 1, 2.

(38)

reserving the same notation for the quantity that will result after the path integration with
respect to the particle coordinates we write

(1) 

t
2

ik[ x(2)  x(1)] 

t
2

ik[ x(2)  x(1)],

(39)

where the arrow serves to signify the fact that a functional integration with respect to the
x( ) elds remains to be carried out. now, along the way, the full computation of (1) will
encounter the quantity x(2)  x(1). taking into account that

< x( ) x( ) >x=

2
t

,

(40)

whose justication is, as we shall see later, intimately connected with reparametrization
invariance, we are in position to replace (39) by

(1)  ik[ x(1)  x(2)]  ik[ x(1)  x(2)].

(41)

10

next, we consider the contribution from the second order term which, according to our

general discussion, is given by

(2) =

t 2
8

(2)(2)(1)(1)[k x(2)k x(2)][k x(1)k x(1)]+(1  2). (42)

taking on the task of calculating expectation values in the -sector of the (super)particle

system we determine, once keeping only the symmetric term under the exchange 1  2,

2 < (t )(t )(2)(2)(1)(1) >=

1
4

[  ][sign(1  2)]2

(43)

as before, we keep the notation (2) for the quantity which results from path integration
in the super-particle sector. substitution of (46) into (45) furnishes the intermediate result

(44)

where we have, following strassler, set gf (1, 2) = sign(1  2).

further utilization of the bosonic sector path integration allows us to cast (2) in the

more simplied form

(2)  (k2  kk)g2

f (1, 2) = (d  1)k2g2

f (1, 2).

(45)

all higher order terms in the exponential expansion of the spin-factor term give vanishing
contribution to the greens function. here, we explicitly witness the harmonization of the
spin-factor with dynamical aspects of the calculation: recognizing the order of the pertur-
bative expansion the spin-factor series terminates when the number of vertices (points on
the path where a force is exerted) is saturated.

putting together everything that was so far carried out, we arrive at the following world-

line expression for the fermionic propagator, to second order in perturbation theory,

the above results express the embodiment of spin factor contribution to worldline for-
mulas. clearly, the immediate question is whether (46) furnishes the same perturbative
expression for the propagator that one extracts, conventionally, through feynman diagram-
matic, rather than worldline, reasoning. that this is, indeed, the case will be established in
section 6. more interesting, of course, is the question regarding whether the formalism that
has been developed in this work can dene autonomous approaches to eld theoretical com-
putations or, at least, oer practical advantages for higher order perturbative calculations
for processes involving external fermionic elds. setting this issue aside we shall, in the next
section, turn our attention to the establishment of a set of rules pertaining to expectation
values of bosonic eld products.

5. computational tools in the super-particle representation

the novel feature of the worldline formalism is the super-particle mode of description
which pervades its expressions for each given quantity of physical interest. our spin factor
manipulations in the previous section has mainly concentrated on aspects surrounding path
integration over fermionic coordinates. in the present section we shall conduct a systematic
discussion of the particle-based (super)sector whose ultimate aim is to promote the practical
side of the worldline scheme.

focusing on the bosonic sector of super-particle actions we realize that its kinetic term has
0 d x2( ). corresponding propagators can be appropriately dened.

for open lines the greens function is denoted by (,  ). it obeys the equation

the conventional form r t

2
 2 (,  )) = (   ),

(48)

with boundary conditions (0,  ) = (t,  ) = 0.

for closed contours the situation demands closer inspection. as argued by strassler [7],

the relevant greens function, to be denoted by gb(,  ), obeys an equation of the form

1
c

2
 2 gb(,  )) = (   ) 

1
t

,

(49)

where t is the length, according to a chosen parametrization, of the (closed) contour. fol-
lowing strassler we adopt the convention which sets c = 2.

one obtains, respectively,

(,  ) =

 (t   )

t

(    ) +

 (t   )

t

(   ),




(,  ) = (    ) 

 
t

(50)

and

gb(,  ) =

t

(t  |   |),




gb(,  ) = sign(   ) 

2(   )

t

.

(51)

we also mention the relations




[(, 2)  (, 1)] =

1
2




[gb(, 1)  gb(, 2)],

2
   (,  ) =

1
2

gb(,  ), (52)

12

where the double dot on gb signies second derivative with respect to  . finally, during
our calculations we shall, following strassler, use the rules gb(,  ) = 0 and g2
b(,  ) = 0.
gb(,  ) =  gb( ,  ).

as a rst application let us establish the validity of eq. (40). we readily determine

(53)

one, thereby, explicitly veries that integration over the bosonic coordinates x( ) produces a
result induced by parametrization invariance as it yields a constant measure for the velocity:
< | x|2 >= 2d
t .

next, we undertake the computation of expectation values of the rst few products of
derivatives of bosonic elds x( ), with action functional the one that arose in connection
with our second order fermionic propagator expression, cf. eq. (46). the particle-based
(bosonic) action reads

s =

d x2 + ik  [x(2)  x(1)].

(54)

1

4 z t

0

the fact that terms of higher than 2nd power are absent in s encourages the employment
of techniques which base themselves on solutions of the classical equations of motion. the
latter read

t

xcl
 ( ) = 2ik[(  2)  (  1)].

xcl

under the substitution x( )  x( ) + xcl( ) the action becomes

s = scl +

with

scl =

consider, rst, the case of < x( ) >. we readily determine

< x( ) >= n 1z x(0)=x

x(t )=y

dx( ) x( )es = xcl

where we have dened

n = z x(0)=x

(57)

(58)

(59)

(60)

(61)

which, given the equal time rules mentioned after eq (52) along with the fact that gb(,  ) =
 gb( ,  ), yields

 (i) = u + ik gb(1, 2),
xcl

i = 1, 2.

(62)

observe, in passing, the consistency of the above result with substitution (32) associated with
non-vanishing contributions of the spin factor in the bosonic sector. indeed, we determine

< x(1 + )  x(1  ) >x= ik[ gb(1 + 1, 1)  gb(1  1, 1)] = 2ik = 2ik1. (63)

for the correlator we nd

< x(1) x(2) >x = xcl

where no =

the last relation brings to surface the fact that gb(i, j) will make regular appear-
ances into our expressions. an immediate problem can be identied with its delta function
component whose presence becomes the source of potential ultraviolet problems. the way
to confront this issue is by performing an integration by parts which replaces gb(i, j)
by g2
b(i, j). even at that one could still anticipate problems associated with the end
point behavior of integrations with respect to the dis, where i denotes a point of gauge
eld contact with the super-particle contour. as with the case of closed contours [7], what
saves the situation is the fact that partial integration invariably produces the combination
g2
f (i, j) which eliminates any pathological behavior7. the super-particle de-
scription, which, in our treatment, has been introduced through the spin factor, plays a
crucial role in producing singularity free expressions.

b(i, j)  g2

in conclusion, our work in this section underlines the parallelism between open and closed
line computational subtlelties. nothing that arises in the former fails to do so in the latter
case, or vice versa. the only dierence is that additional terms in the super-particle action
are induced by the new boundary conditions but which have no fundamental impact, as
far as divergent behavior is concerned. even though we shall not, in the present paper,
study physical quantities in which external gauge eld lines attach themselves onto matter
particle contours we fully expect to encounter analogous computational features, e.g. pinch
singularities, in these situations as well. we plan to report on such calculations in the near
future.

6. first application: recovery of feynman diagrammatic expan-

sion to 2nd order

we have already pointed out that nothing is lost to the original content of the eld
theoretical system on the account of manipulations that have taken place for the purpose of
casting it into its worldline form. as a rst illustration -which, at the same time, will enable

7as an explicit illustration of this occurrence the reader is referred to the next section where a computation

pertaining to g(2)(x, y) will be carried out.

14

us to see the corresponding particle-based computational tools at work- we intend, in this
section, to prove the equivalence between the worldline and feynman perturbative expansions
for the fermionic propagator, to second order. given the notable calculational advantages
that have already been established for non-abelian gauge eld theories in connection with
closed particle contours [14, 7, 26], one is encouraged to think that our present extension
will lead to ecient ways for perturbative estimates, to a given order, for processes involving
open matter particle contours as well.

let us commence our considerations by dispensing with the 0th order term of the
fermionic propagator. as per our discussion in the previous section, we expect no contribu-
tion from the spin factor in the super particle action. indeed, the only available four-vector
in the free propagation case is u = 1
t (x  y) and there is no way to generate antisymmetric
combinations from it. the relevant worldline expression reads

ig(0)(x, y) = z 

0

dt et m2z x(0)=x

x(t )=y

dx( )[m

4r t
  x(t )]e 1

d x2( ).

(65)

the solution of the classical equations of motion is, simply, xcl( ) = , with  as in eq.
(56). under the substitution x( )  xcl( ) + x( ) path integration is performed with the
same action but with boundary conditions x(0) = x(t ) = 0. given that the classical value
of the action is 1

focusing our attention to the mass containing term im in ig(2)(x, y) we rst recall that
spin factor contributions are already contained in (46). moreover, we have carried out, in the
previous section, the computation of relevant expectation values with respect to the bosonic
action given by eq. (54). putting everything, that has already been worked out, together we

for the reader who is acquainted with closed-contour worldline manipulations the analogy
with the above practice is familiar; simply the exponential has more terms for open lines.
the important point is that in both situations the integration by parts goes through on the
basis of the adopted regularization, namely gb(,  ) = 0.

some comments are in order with respect to what has taken place in producing the above
result. the most obvious one is that  assumes the role of a feynman parameter as per the
standard diagrammatic manipulation. given its introduction the following practical rules of
substitution, with regard to the original worldline expression, emerge

gb(1, 2) = 1  2,

g2

b(1, 2)  g2

f (1, 2) = 4(1  ).

(70)

the last relation is especially notable as it explicitly underlines the absence of divergencies
in the integral over the feynman parameter.

turning our attention to the -matrix part, i, of the second order propagator we need

the following results pertaining to expectation values

<   x(t ) >=

1

(4t )d/2   xcl(t ),

(71)

< k  x(t )  x(i) >=

1

(4t )d/2 [  k gb(i, t ) + k  xcl(t )  xcl(i)],

i = 1, 2,

(72)

< x(t )  x(i) >=

1

(4t )d/2 [d gb(i, t ) + xcl(t )  xcl(i)],

i = 1, 2

(73)

and

<   x(t ) xcl(1)  xcl(2 > =

1

(4t )d/2 [d  xcl(t ) gb(1, 2) +   xcl(1) gb(2, t )
+  xcl(2) gb(1, t ) +   xcl(t ) xcl(1))  xcl(2)].

(74)

as before, we must integrate by parts and make the variable change which introduces
the feynman parameter . doing so we are led to the following result, in momentum space,

i(q) = ig2cf z

which explicitly shows that the worldline perturbative, to second order, term for the fermionic
propagator coincides with the one obtained via the feynman diagrammatic expansion.

7. one loop calculation in the fermionic propagator

in this section we shall apply the worldline approach to a loop calculation pertaining to
an open line which extends a recent closed line result by schubert [27], see also ref [28].
specically, by going back to (35) we shall perform the loop integration, equivalently, the
integration over ddk, thereby extracting an expression for the second order contribution to
the fermionic propagator in parametric form. so as not to bore the reader with endless
manipulations we shall restrict our attention to the mass term entering (35) which reads

as already mentioned, we shall refrain from working out the gamma-matrix part of the
propagator. the point is that our methods have produced a one loop result in a parametrized
form pertaining to a conguration with an open fermionic line, thereby extending the scope
and use of the approach and methodology of ref. [7].

8. concluding remarks

our eorts, in this work, have centered around the role of the spin factor in the worldline
approach to gauge theories with fermionic matter elds. placing specic emphasis on open

19

particle path congurations we were able to accommodate the spin attribute of the prop-
agating entity into a geometrical type of expression (spin factor) which registers as a well
dened weight factor in the path integral. further to the point, its presence facilitates the
extraction of simple computational rules which, at the perturbative level at least, produce
algorithms of the bern-kosower type [14] while extending, at the same time, their applica-
bility to fermionic greens functions. on the other hand, the dynamics of the particle-based
casting of the system amounts to emission and absorption of gauge eld modes by the matter
particle which is solely controlled by a wilson line operator. our scheme thereby achieves a
neat separation between geometrical and dynamical aspects of physical descriptions in gauge
eld theories. to summarize, our formulation has not only made it possible to accommodate
open fermionic paths, equivalently, greens functions, into worldline considerations but has
produced computational rules that have clear as well as simple interpretations.

the fact that our approach has identied the wilson line operator as the sole agent of
the dynamics operating in the system is worth some further comments. this occurrence has
proven to be of central importance to the dynamical considerations we have been pursuing
in connection to long distance properties of qcd [10-12]. the wider realization that wilson
line operators carry the dynamics of eikonally-based considerations in qcd is, actually, well
founded in a variety of approaches which aim at factorizing soft contributions to quantities
of physical interest, such as form factors and parton-parton scattering amplitudes [29-34]. a
marked contrast is that in the worldline approach to qcd wilson lines enter directly as an
indigenous component of the action whereas in standard eld theoretical approaches they
are brought in, within the context of an operator formalism, for the purpose of representing
quarks as ordered exponentials of the gluon eld connected at the point where the hard
scattering occurs. in other words, they enter as sort of tails attached to the quark eld
operator for the purpose of accounting for long distance behavior. our present work further
establishes the role of the wilson line operators as the quantity which carries the dynamics
in a gauge eld theory even beyond soft eects.

be that as it may, our immediate plans are to study situations wherein external gluonic
elds attach themselves to an open fermionic line thereby extending the present considera-
tions to vertex functions and compton amplitudes. we expect to report on progress along
these lines soon.

we display, below, some interim steps associated with the derivation of formulas given in
section 7. consider the particle-based action functional s as registered in eq. (79). casting
it in the form

with the rst term in the series to be denoted, for the present purposes, by (0)(, ); it
actually coincides with the free bosonic propagator, cf. eq. (50).

straight forward manipulations on the matrix elements entering the above series result

to the following, closed-form, relation

(1)(, ) = (0)(, ) 

[(0)(, 1)  (0)(, 2)][(0)(1, )  (0)(2, )]

which, in turn, leads to eq. (89) in the text.

the classical bosonic particle elds

turning our attention to expectation values, let us rst furnish an outline derivation of
