abstract

we construct the gauge eld and graviton propagators in euclidean adsd+1 space-time
by two different methods. in the rst method the gauge invariant maxwell or linearized
ricci operator is applied directly to bitensor ansatze for the propagators which reect their
gauge structure. this leads to a rapid determination of the physical part of the propagators
in terms of elementary functions. the second method is a more traditional approach using
covariant gauge xing which leads to a solution for both physical and gauge parts of the
propagators. the gauge invariant parts agree in both methods.

1 introduction

one important aspect of the ads/cft correspondence conjectured in [1, 2, 3] is the calculation
of correlation functions in type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 [4] in order to study the large n
strong coupling dynamics of n = 4 superconformal yang-mills theory.

bulk to bulk greens functions, describing propagation between two interior points of ads,
are required to compute 4-point functions [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. scalar and spinor propagators for
general mass have been discussed in the old literature [11] on ads eld theory. the feynman
gauge propagator for massless gauge bosons, was obtained in [12]. the result involves tran-
scendental functions which cancel for physical components of the gauge eld. this motivated
a recent simpler derivation [8] which used a convenient bitensor ansatz to obtain the physical
part of the propagator as a simple algebraic function of the chordal distance variable. there are
older covariant treatments of the graviton propagator [13, 14, 15] in de sitter space (of constant
positive curvature) which again involve transcendental functions, and there is recent work on the
gauge boson and graviton propagators for ads in noncovariant gauges [6].

in the present paper, we shall construct the gauge boson and graviton propagator in adsd+1
using two different methods, both covariant under the isometry group so(d + 1, 1) of the eu-
clidean ads space.

the rst method is a modication of that of [8]. the key step is a pair of ansatze for the
bitensor propagators which naturally separate gauge invariant parts from gauge artifacts. the
latter do not contribute for conserved sources of the elds. the gauge invariant components can
then be rather simply obtained by substituting the ansatz in the maxwell or linearized ricci equa-
tions. they are given by elementary functions. gauge xing is unnecessary because we work
on the subspace of conserved sources. in the second method the propagators are constructed in
the landau gauge. this method is closely related to the work of [12, 13, 14, 15], with some
new technical simplications. in particular we nd a simple and general way to solve the inho-
mogeneous equation that arises for the transverse traceless part of the propagator. it is shown
explicitly that the gauge invariant parts of the propagators agree in both methods.

these results have immediate applications to 4-point functions in the ads/cf t correspon-
dence. only the gauge invariant part of the propagators is required, since they are coupled to
conserved currents or stress tensors. the amplitude for gauge boson exchange between external
scalar elds was presented in [8]. the calculation of graviton exchange for even d and general
integer scaling dimension  of external scalars is complete and will be presented shortly [16].

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we introduce standard notations for euclidean

1

adsd+1 and apply the new method to obtain the gauge boson propagator. this method is then
applied to the graviton propagator in section 3. the more traditional landau gauge methods are
applied to the gauge and graviton propagators in sections 4 and 5, respectively.

2 new method for the gauge propagator

we work on the euclidean continuation of adsd+1, viewed as the upper half space, z0 > 0, in
rd+1 with metric g given by

ds2 =

d

x,=0

gdzdz =

1
z2
0

(dz2

0 +

d

xi=1

dz2

i ) .

(2.1)

the adsd+1 scale has been set to unity, and the metric above has constant negative curvature
r = d(d + 1). it is well known that invariant functions and tensors on adsd+1 are most simply
expressed in terms of the chordal distance variable u, dened by

(z  w)2
2z0w0

u 

(2.2)

where (z  w)2 = (z  w)(z  w) is the at euclidean distance.

the action of an abelian gauge eld coupled to a conserved current source j  in the adsd+1

background is

sa = z dd+1zg[

1
4

f f  aj ] .

(2.3)

we have not included a gauge xing term, because we work directly on the restricted space of
conserved currents and look for a solution of the euler-lagrange equation in the form

a(z) = z dd+1wgg (z, w)j  

(w)

(2.4)

with bitensor propagator g (z, w). we see that the propagator must satisfy the ads-covariant
equation ( = 

z and  = 

w )

d[g]  = g (z, w) +  (z, w)

(2.5)

here,  is a vector function, which acts as a pure gauge term, and will cancel out when inte-
grating (2.5) against any conserved current j  .

any bitensor can be expressed [12] as a sum of two linearly independent forms with scalar
coefcients. following [8] we choose two independent bitensors derived from the biscalar vari-
able u, namely

 u = 

1

z0w0

[  +

1
w0

(z  w) 0 +

1
z0

(w  z) 0  u0 0]

(2.6)

2

and u u with

u =

 u =

1
z0
1
w0

[(z  w)/w0  u0]
[(w  z) /z0  u 0] .

(2.7)

the propagator can be represented as a superposition of the bitensors  u and u  u times

scalar functions of u. it is more convenient to use the equivalent form [8]

g (z, w) = ( u)f (u) +  s(u)

(2.8)

in which f (u) describes the propagation of the physical components of a and s(u) is a gauge
artifact. we see that s(u) drops out of the invariant equation (2.5) and the integral solution (2.4)
and can be discarded. thus we must determine only f (u) which we will nd by substitution of
(2.8) into (2.5).

for this we need certain properties of derivatives of u, most of which were derived in [8] and

which we list here. (some of these will be needed only later.)

2u = du = (d + 1)(1 + u)
du u = u(2 + u)

du = g(1 + u)
(du) (d u) = u u
(du) ( u) = (1 + u) u
(du) ( u) = g  + u u

d u = g u

with the help of (2.9-2.15), we readily nd

d[g]  =  u[  u(2 + u)f (u)  d(1 + u)f (u)]

+u u[(1 + u)f (u) + df (u)] .

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

for distinct z and w, the -function term in (2.5) may be ignored. using ads-invariance, we
also have  = u (u) in (2.5). using (2.16) we nd that (2.5) gives the set of two second
order differential equations for the functions f (u) and (u), namely

u(2 + u)f  + d(1 + u)f  = 
(1 + u)f  + df  =  .

(2.17)

(2.18)

3

now, (2.18) is readily integrated to give (1 + u)f  + (d  1)f = . (an integration constant
is chosen to vanish so that f(u) vanishes on the boundary.) eliminating  between (2.17) and
(2.18) gives

u(2 + u)f  + (d + 1)(1 + u)f  + (d  1)f = 0 ,

which agrees with [8] and is just the invariant equation

(2  m2)f (u) = 0

(2.19)

(2.20)

for the propagator of a scalar eld of mass m2 = (d  1). the solution is the elementary
function, normalized to include the  function in (2.5),

f (u) =

2 (cid:17)
(cid:16) d1
(4)(d+1)/2 [u(2 + u)](d1)/2 .

(2.21)

as a further check on the consistency of this approach, we note that  vanishes as 1/ud+1 on the
boundary. the current j  (w) is also expected to vanish, and there is then no surface term which
could negate the statement following (2.5) that the gauge term cancels out.

there is an even faster variation of this method, a bit less clear pedagogically, which we
now outline. the advantage is that we need not deal with the gauge function  nor the coupled
equations (2.17-2.18). instead we insert the ansatz (2.8), with s(u) dropped, in the integral (2.4)
and apply the maxwell operator inside the integral. after some calculation using (2.9-2.15) we
nd

d[a](z) = z dd+1wg (cid:20) u2f  d uf   udf(cid:21)j  

(w)

(2.22)

= z dd+1wg (cid:20) u(2f + (d  1)f )   ((d  1)f + (1 + u)f )(cid:21) .

the manipulations of derivatives which lead from the rst to second line are designed so that the
last term is a total derivative with respect to w. this can be partially integrated and dropped by
current conservation. one then nds that

d[a](z) = z dd+1wg  u(2f + (d  1)f )j  

(w) = j(z)

(2.23)

must hold for all choices of current source j(z). therefore f (u) must satisfy (2.20) with
(z, w) on the right side, and the solution with fastest decay on the boundary is (2.21) as
before.

the method of this section is somewhat simpler than that of [8] in which a version of (2.5)
with gauge-xing term added to the wave operator and  = 0 was solved. the immediate

4

extension of that method to the graviton propagator does not work readily because it leads to
intricately coupled equations for 5 scalar functions. the new method is far simpler, as we will
now see.

3 new method for the graviton propagator

the gravitational action in d + 1 dimensional euclidean space with cosmological constant  and
covariant matter action (sm) is

sg =

1

22 z dd+1zg(r  ) + sm .

(3.1)

henceforth we set  = 1. the rst variation with respect to g gives the euler-lagrange
equation

r 

1
2

g(r  ) = t .

(3.2)

we take  = d(d  1) so that without sources (t = 0), we obtain euclidean ads space with
r = d(d + 1) as the maximally symmetric solution of (3.2).

a matter source produces a uctuation h = g about the ads metric g. to obtain the
graviton propagator it is sufcient to consider (3.2) to linear order in h. it is simpler to work
with the equivalent ricci form of this equation, namely

r + dg = t  t 

gt

 .

1
d  1

(3.3)

it is straightforward but tedious to use textbook results [17] on the linearized ricci tensor and
commute covariant derivatives to obtain the linearized equation

 ddh  ddh

 + ddh + ddh  2(h  gh

) = 2 t

(3.4)

all covariant derivatives and contractions in (3.4) are those of the ads metric g of (2.1). at
/2,
this point we could impose a gauge condition such as the dedonder gauge, dh = h
which simplies (3.4), and an approach of this type is pursued in sec 4. here, however, we
will generalize the method used for the gauge propagator in section 2 and work more directly
with (3.4) which is invariant under innitesimal diffeomorphisms, h = dv + dv. we

represent the solution of (3.4) or, equivalently, the linearization of (3.2), as the integral

h(z) = z dd+1wgg; (z, w)t  

(w)

(3.5)

5

this denes the propagator which must then satisfy

gg (cid:17)(z, w) + d;  + d ;

where , (z, w) represents a diffeomorphism (in the  coordinates) whose contribution will
vanish when (3.6) is integrated against the covariantly conserved stress tensor t  .

our strategy now is to solve (3.6) by expanding g;  and ; in an appropriate basis of
bitensors. one basis of fourth rank bitensors obtained by consideration of the geodesic between
the points z and w was proposed by [13] and will be used in the next section. we start with
a very similar basis of 5 independent fourth rank bitensors constructed from the basic forms
u, u, and u dened in (2.6-2.7)

t (1)
;  = g g 
t (2)
;  = u u u  u
t (3)
;  = u  u +  u u
t (4)
;  = g u  u + g  u u
t (5)
;  = u u u + u u u + (   )

and a general ansatz for the propagator as the superposition

g;  =

5

xi=1

t (i)
; a(i)(u)

(3.7)

(3.8)

however, it is very advantageous to reorganize things so as to separate physical components of
the propagator from gauge artifacts, and we therefore postulate the form

g;  = (u  u +  u u) g(u) + gg  h(u)

(3.9)

+ ([)u  u x(u)] + ([ )u u x(u)]

+ ([)u u  u y (u)] + ([ )u u u y (u)]

+ [u z(u)] g  + [ u z(u)] g .

where () denotes symmetrization with strength 1. the terms involving x, y and z are gradients
with respect to z or w. the gradients with respect to z are diffeomorphisms which are annihilated
in (3.6) and give an irrelevant modication of h in (3.5). the gradients with respect to w

6

contribute to the left side of (3.6) as d (  ) and can be absorbed by changing ;  on the
right side. thus we can restrict our attention to the physical g(u) and h(u) terms provided we
are sure that the form (3.9) is actually equivalent to (3.8). it is not hard to convince oneself that
this is the case by applying derivatives in (3.9) to obtain a set of ve equations relating each
a(i)(u) to a combination of g, h, and derivatives of x, y and z. these expressions are simple
enough that one can readily deduce that the a(i) are uniquely determined by g, h, x, y, z and
vice versa. there remains to write an analogous tensor decomposition of the diffeomorphism
term on right side of (3.6) and we use the following

;  = g ua(u) + uu uc(u)

(3.10)

+ ( uu +  uu)b(u)

the stage is now set for the next part of our work which is to substitute the g and h terms of
(3.9) and the decomposition (3.10) in (3.6), apply all derivatives using the relations (2.9-2.15),
and express the result as a superposition of independent tensor terms. actually 6 independent
tensors appear because (3.6) does not have the symmetry under exchange of z and w that the
propagator itself possesses. the full calculation is important but tedious, and we quote only the
nal result, which is

 2(g;   gg

+ g uu[2g  (d  1)h   4b  2(1 + u)c]
+ t (5)[(1 + u)g + (d  1)g  b   c] .

for clarity, we have omitted the indices of the tensors t (i) dened in (3.7). we also assume that
the points are separated so that the -functions in (3.6) can be dropped.

the system of equations which determines the graviton propagator is obtained by setting the
scalar coefcient of each independent tensor in (3.11) to 0. we focus rst on the three equations

c (u) = g(u)

b(u) + c(u) = (1 + u)g(u) + (d  1)g(u)

2b(u) = u(2 + u)g(u) + (d  1)(1 + u)g(u)  2(d  1)g(u) .

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

7

the rst two equations can be integrated immediately to give

c(u) = g(u)
b(u) = (1 + u)g(u) + (d  1)g(u)

(3.15)

integration constants are dropped so that all functions vanish on the boundary. when (3.15) is
substituted in (3.14) we nd an uncoupled differential equation for g(u), namely

0 = u(2 + u)g(u) + (d + 1)(1 + u)g(u)

(3.16)

comparing with (2.19-2.20) we see that this is exactly the equation for a massless scalar prop-
agator. this result is consistent with the analysis of [6] in a non-covariant gauge. the correctly
normalized solution can be obtained from older ads literature [11] and is given by the hyperge-
ometric function

g(u) = cd(2u1)df (d,

d + 1

2

; d + 1;2u1)

(3.17)

cd =

( d+1
2 )

(4)(d+1)/2d

an explicit solution in terms of elementary functions will be given below.

we must now study the three remaining tensor equations in (3.11). after eliminating b(u)

and c(u) using (3.12) and (3.13) these become

(3.18)
0 = 2g + 2(1 + u)g + 4(d  1)g + (d  1)h 
0 = u(2 + u)h   2d(1 + u)h  + 2dh + 4g  2(1 + u)g  2(1 + u)a (3.19)
(3.20)
0 = (1 + u)g + 2(d + 1)g  a

since g(u) is already known from (3.16), this is an over-determined system, and we must both
obtain a solution and check its consistency.

for this purpose we introduce the function p(u) such that

p(u) = g(u)

with

p() = p() = 0 .

(3.21)

in terms of this function, it is not hard to solve the equations of (3.18-3.20) explicitly. from
(3.18) and (3.20), and the requirement that h(u) and a(u) vanish at u = , one obtains respec-
tively

 (d  1)h(u) = 2p(u) + 2(1 + u)p(u) + 4(d  2)p(u)

a(u) = (1 + u)p(u) + (2d + 1)p(u)

(3.22)

(3.23)

8

one can then check to see that (3.19) is also satised, if we use (3.16) and its integrated versions
expressed in terms of p(u), which are given by

u(2 + u)p(u) + (d  1)(1 + u)p(u)  (d  1)p(u) = 0
u(2 + u)p(u) + (d  3)(1 + u)p(u)  2(d  2)p(u) = 0

(3.24)

a more useful expression for h(u) can be obtained by eliminating p(u) in (3.22) using (3.24).
this gives

 (d  1)h(u)
(d  1)p(u) = 2 cd(2u1)d1f (d  1, d+1

= 2(1 + u)2g(u) + 2(d  2)(1 + u)p(u)

2 ; d + 1;2u1) .

(3.25)

(3.26)

since g(u) and h(u) express the physical content of the propagator and occur in integrals
over adsd+1 in applications to the ads/cft correspondence, explicit expressions in terms of
elementary functions are most useful. the rst step to obtain them is to integrate (3.16) to obtain

g(u)  1/[u(2 + u)]

d+1

2

(3.27)

the next integral can be evaluated, but the general form of the result depends on whether d is
even or odd. for d even we can rearrange the result given in [18] (see sec. 2.263,(4)) to obtain

g(u) =

(d/2)()d/2

(3.28)

it can be veried directly that (3.28) is the integral of (3.27) which vanishes at u = . the
normalization of (3.28) was chosen by requiring agreement with the hypergeometric form (3.17)
as u approaches 0. one can then use (3.25) to obtain an analogous expression for h(u), namely

h(u) = 
(cid:26) 2(1 + u)

for d = 2p + 1, the hypergeometric functions entering into the denition of g(u) and h(u) are
degenerate, and reduce to elementary functions involving logarithms. these expressions will not
be given here.

as in the case of the photon propagator it is worth observing here that there is a more di-
rect way of obtaining the gauge invariant functions g(u) and h(u) in which the compensating
diffeomorphism (3.10) and the manipulation of a set of coupled equations for g, h, a, b, c are
entirely avoided. the procedure is to substitute the ansatz (3.9), with gauge terms dropped, in
the integral (3.5). we then apply the ricci operator (3.6) under the integral, using (3.11) (with
diffeomorphism terms dropped). the various tensor terms are then manipulated so as to isolate
w which vanish by partial integration since dt  (w) = 0. there are 3
total derivatives
independent tensor structures in the remaining terms, which directly give (3.16) for g(u), and
(3.18) and (3.19) for h(u) (the latter with the solution of (3.20) for a(u) already in place).



our nal observation, from (3.17) and (3.25), is that g(u) and h(u) vanish on the boundary
as 1/ud and 1/u(d2) respectively. one can then look back to (3.12-3.14) and (3.23) and observe
that the functions a(u), b(u) and c(u) of the compensating diffeomorphism in (3.10) vanish as
1/u(d1), 1/ud and 1/u(d+1), respectively. there is then no boundary contribution in the integral
of (3.6) with a conserved stress tensor provided that t00(w) vanishes on the boundary. this is a
consistency check on the approach we have used. however, because the method is new, a further
check is also desirable. for this reason we show in section 5 that one obtains the same functions
g(u) and h(u) from a more traditional approach. *-.4in

4 the photon propagator in the landau gauge

in this second part of the paper we wish to obtain the photon and graviton propagators in adsn
(n = d + 1) by a more standard covariant gaugexing procedure. we will employ techniques
developed in [12, 13, 14, 15], following quite closely [15] where a simplied derivation of the
graviton propagator for 4dimensional de sitter space was given.
in this and the following
section we will adopt the conventions introduced in [12], which are followed throughout this
earlier literature.

let (z, w) be the geodesic distance between z and w. then the basic tensors are the unit
tangents to the geodesics at z and w:

n(z, w) = d(z, w), n(z, w) = d(z, w)

(4.1)

together with the parallel transporter g  
 (z, w) and the metric tensor itself at z and w. we
summarize in table 1 some useful geometric identities while table 2 contains the dictionary that
translates between the two different sets of conventions used in the rst and second part of the
paper. note the the ads scale is always set to 1, i.e. the curvature scalar is r = n(n  1).

let us now impose the landau gauge

which implies   0. with this gauge choice the maxwell equations read:

 (g 2  r)a = j

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

where the current is understood to be conserved, dj = 0. the photon propagator g  in the
landau gauge satises

where we have used r = (n  1)g for adsn.

4.3 ansatz for the propagator using bitensors

we will now closely follow the manipulations in section iii of [12], where the spin 1 massive
propagator was derived. the crucial difference between the discussion in [12] and our case is
the presence of the projector on the r.h.s. of (4.8). we thus expect, and we are going to conrm,
that the naive m2  0 limit of the result in [12] does not give the correct landau gauge massless
propagator. it gives instead a pure gauge part that can be added to the massless propagator.

the most general ansatz for g  consistent with the symmetries of adsn is

g  

 = ()g  

 + ()n 

let

n .

(4.9)

(4.10)

then using the identities in table 1 (see [12]) one nds that the gauge condition dg  = 0
gives:

 (n  1)c =   + (n  1)a , .

(4.11)
we can apply the operator  (2 + (n  1)) onto (4.9) to obtain the l.h.s. of (4.8) [12]. we can
extract an equation for  by contracting the resulting bitensor with nn . the r.h.s. of (4.8) for
z 6= w is, after an integration by parts, dd  21. the contraction with nn  gives

then we obtain the equation

where 0 is the massless scalar propagator1

where we have used (4.14) to simplify the r.h.s2. observe that the r.h.s. is an eigenvector of zero
eigenvalue of the differential operator on the l.h.s., up to a delta function term at x = 1. this has
a simple physical interpretation: for z 6= w, the projector on the r.h.s of (4.8) is a pure gradient
(see(4.5)), and thus a zero mode of the maxwell operator.

to nd a more explicit form of the r.h.s. we use the following observation. for any f,

it follows that, for x 6= 1,

(4.18)

(4.19)

it is now easy to solve for d
dx 0 by noting that (2n+2 + n) is the hypergeometric operator with
parameters a = n, b = 1, c = n/2 + 1. the solution with fast falloff at the boundary (x  )
is, since a > b [18]

(x)a f (a, a + 1  c; a + 1  b; x1) = (x)n/2(1  x)n/2.

the two homogeneous solutions of (4.17) are readily obtained by recognizing that the l.h.s.

for the general solution of (4.17):

(4.28)

notice that we have chosen a basis of homogeneous solutions in which 1 is singular at short
distance ( 1/(x  1)n/2 as x  1) and has fast falloff at the boundary ( 1/xn1 for x  ),
while 2 is smooth for x  1 and falls like 1/x2 at innity.

the constants a and b are determined by physical considerations. first, we demand the
photon propagator to have the same short distance singularity as in at space. this requires  
1/(x  1)n/21 and hence a  0. second, we choose the boundary condition of fastest possible
falloff as x  , which xes b  (1)
. with this choice,   log x/xn1 as

4.5 comparison to the new form of the propagator

we now wish to make contact between this standard landau gauge propagator and the new form
of the propagator described in section 2. to compare, we go back to the variable u = 2x  2

15

and write our landau gauge propagator in the same tensor basis used in (2.8):

glandau

 

= ( u) f (u) +   s(u) .

using the conversion formulas of table 2, it is easy to show:

 f (u) + s (u) = 

u + 2

s (u) =

+



u(u + 2)

.

(4.31)

(4.32)

(4.33)

one can show that if  satises (4.17) then f obeys (2.19). this is enough to prove that f =
f , since the solution of (2.19) is uniquely specied (up to a factor) by the boundary condition
of fastest falloff at the boundary, and the normalization is xed in both cases by matching to the
at space limit. as expected, the landau gauge f coincides with the universal f found in
section 2.

the functional form of s is instead specic to our landau gauge choice. as a nal con-
sistency check, one can show that the gauge piece   s(u) gives no contribution when
integrated with conserved currents. indeed, s(u)  1/un3 as u   and s(u)  1/un/22
as u  0, which is enough to ensure the vanishing of the boundary terms in the integration by
parts. it is interesting to observe that, for u 6= 0, the homogeneous solutions 1 and 2 do not
contribute to the physical term f . one may then be tempted to treat 1 and 2 as pure gauge
artifacts and conclude that the constants a and b in (4.24) can be arbitrarily specied. this is
however not quite correct. changing a and b from the determined values would make s too
singular at the origin or at innity, so that   s(u) could not be gauged away from physical
amplitudes.

5 the graviton propagator in the landau gauge

we now wish to obtain the graviton propagator in the landau gauge. our analysis will parallel
in many aspects the discussion of the photon in the previous section, although some new features
will emerge.

where the righthand side is the transverse spin 1 projector (4.5). note that this is not the same as
(4.8), the equation obeyed by the massless spin 1 propagator in the landau gauge, the difference
being in the value of the mass. it is understood the all the greens functions in (5.35.7) obey
the boundary conditions appropriate for anti de sitter space, namely fastest possible falloff at
the boundary. notice that in contrast to the de sitter case discussed in [15] we do not have a
contribution to the r.h.s. of (5.7) from zero modes.

the covariant gauge choice which yields the simplest results is the landau gauge:

dh =

1
n

dh .

with this gauge choice, b = a

  0 and the graviton propagator can be written as:

g (z, w) = gg t ((z, w)) + g(2)

 (z, w)

with g(2)

 (z, w) transverse and traceless:

dg(2)

(5.12)

(5.13)

where the spin 2 projector has been dened in (5.6). we now proceed to solve (5.12) and (5.13).

5.2 solving for t

using r = n(n 1) we see that (5.12) denes a scalar propagator of m2 = n. introducing the
variable x  cosh2(/2) = (u + 2)/2 we recognize (5.12) (see (4.16)) as the hypergeometric
equation of parameters a = n, b = 1, c = n/2. the fastest falloff solution with short distance
singularity normalized as in (5.12) is [11] [18]:

t (x) =

dx t , so that t (x)
observe that using (4.18) the operator (2n  n) on t changes to 2n+2 on d
could also be obtained by quadrature. t (x) is actually an algebraic function for odd n. for
example, for n = 5:

5.3 ansatz for g(2)

  in terms of bitensors

we want to write the most general ansatz for g(2)
  consistent with ads symmetry. the 5
independent fourth rank bitensors which are symmetric under   ,     and (, ) 
(,  ) are taken to be:
o(1)
  = gg 
o(2)
  = nnnn 
o(3)
  = gg  + g g
o(4)
  = gnn  + g nn
o(5)
  = gnn  + g nn + g nn + gnn  .

(5.16)

this basis is linearly related that of (3.7), as shown in table 3. we then have

g(2)

  =

the tracelessness conditions (5.11) imply:

dene f and g as

then the transversality conditions (5.10) imply:

 1! c()g4() = 0

g() + na()g() + 2nc()f () = 0 .

(5.20)

(5.21)

(5.22)

(5.23)

it is easy to see that the ve functions gi can be determined immediately from the single function
g. to nd g, we need to use the equation of motion (5.13). operating (2  2) onto the ansatz
(5.17) (see formulas (a4) in [14]) we get the l.h.s. of (5.13). contracting the resulting bitensor
with nnnn  we can extract an expression containing only g. equ.(5.13) then implies:

(5.24)

5.4 finding the r.h.s.

we now need a more explicit form for the spin 2 projector (5.6), which appears in (5.24). dene
0 as in (4.14) and

(2  n) 1(z, w) = (z, w) .

(5.25)

further, as in the case of the photon propagator (see (4.9)), let us write the ansatz for q  

(5.7) as

in

q  

 = ()g  

 + ()n 

n.

going through the same steps as in section 4.3, we dene

and we arrive at

  d2
d2 + (n + 1)a()

d

d!  = 

d2
d2 0 .

using (4.14) we can rewrite (5.28) as

0(cid:21) = 0 .

(5.26)

(5.27)

(5.28)

(5.29)

we require that  obeys the usual boundary condition of fastest falloff at innity and matches
at short distance the at space singularity. since the homogeneous solutions of (5.29) are either
too singular at short distance or fall off too slowly at innity, we choose the particular solution:

 =

n  1

2

0 .

(5.30)

we are now in the position to evaluate the r.h.s. of the basic equation (5.24). let z 6= w.

from the expansion (5.26) of q we nd

now recalling (5.30), using the equations obeyed by 0 and 1 and changing to the variable x,

p (2)

  = s0(x) + s1(x),

dx2 1, we

(2n+4 + n + 2)

d2
dx2 1(x) = 0

(5.37)

which is the same as (4.19) with n  n + 2. the fast falloff solution normalized as in (5.25) is

(5.40)

.

observe that s0 and s1 have opposite symmetry properties under antipodal reection x 
1  x.

5.5 solving for g

if we imagine to turn off the source s1, the equation (5.24) is the same as the corresponding pho-
ton equation (4.17) with n  n + 2 and a different normalization of the source. the functional
form of a particular solution g0
part corresponding to the source s0 can thus be read from (4.25).
accounting for the different normalization we nd:

g0
part(x) =

n(n + 1)(cid:16) n
(n  1)2n+2

2  1(cid:17)

n

d
dx

z x

0

dx f (n + 2, 1;
[x(x  1)]

n

n
2

+ 2; x)

(5.41)







for odd n, the hypergeometric function in (5.41) is actually a polynomial of degree n  2.

as in the case of the photon, for x 6= 1, s0 is an eigenfunction of the differential operator on
the l.h.s. of (5.24) with zero eigenvalue. it turns out that the source s1 is also an eigenfunction
of the same operator with eigenvalue  (n2)(n1)

. thus the particular solution g1

part is

n

g1
part = 

n

(n  2)(n  1)

s1.

the general solution of (5.24) is then given by (compare with (4.254.27)):

part + ag1 + bg2

g1 =

g = g1

part + g0
2x  1
[x(x  1)]
g2 = f (2, n + 1;

(5.42)

(5.43)

(5.44)

(5.45)

notice that g1 is singular at short distance ( 1/(x  1)n/2+1 as x  1) and falls like 1/xn+1 as
x  , while g2 is smooth at x = 1 and falls like 1/x2 at innity. the constant a is determined
by demanding that the graviton propagator has the same short distance singularity as in at

21

space, which requires g  /(x  1)n/21. this xes a  n(n+1)( n

g(x) + (2(n  1)x  n + 2) g(x)! .

(5.51)

the full graviton propagator in the landau gauge is given by (5.9), so that its components
in the tensor basis (5.16) are simply (t + g1, g2, g3, g4, g5), where the trace term t was
determined in (5.14).

5.6 comparison to the new form of the propagator

to make contact with the discussion in section 3, we go back to the variable u = 2x  2 and
write the landau gauge graviton propagator in a tensor basis analogous to (3.9):

glandau

  = (u  u +  u u) g(u) + gg  h(u)

(5.52)

22

+ ([)u  u x(u)] + ([ )u u x(u)]
+ ([)u u  u y (u)] + ([ )u u u y (u)]
+ [u z(u)] g  + [ u z(u)] g .

t1 = o1
t2 =
t3 =
t4 =
t5 =

[u(u + 2)]2o2

2u2o2 +o3

4u2(u + 2)o2

table 3

u(u + 2)o4

uo5

u(u + 2)o5

using the conversion formulas between the two tensor basis (3.7) and (5.16) given in table

3, one can show:

u2(u + 2)2

g5(u) + ug3(u)

u(u + 2)

 2 y (u)

y (u) =

g2(u) + 2u2g3(u) + 4ug5(u)

1
4
x (u) = 
z (u) =
g(u) = g3(u)  2 x(u)
h(u) = t (u) + g1(u)  2(1 + u) z(u) .

g4(u)
u(u + 2)  2 x(u)  2(1 + u) y (u)

as in the case of the photon, one expects the landau gauge h and g to be exactly the
universal h and g found in section 3. we directly checked this for n = 5 working with
the explicit expressions for gi and t . it is worth commenting on some interesting features of
this check. first, the homogeneous solutions g1 and g2 do not contribute at all to h and g,
at least for u 6= 0. they however do contribute to x, y , z. the role of the homogeneous
solutions is again to ensure the proper falloff and short distance singularity of the gauge terms,
so that they can be removed when integrating the propagator with conserved currents. second,
part to the physical functions h, g is precisely removed by adding the trace
the contribution of g1
term t . therefore there is no effective propagation of the scalar of m2 = n.
