abstract

we study the d8-branes of the romans massive iia supergravity theory
using the coupled supergravity and worldvolume actions. d8 branes can be
regarded as domain walls with the jump in the extrinsic curvature at the
brane given by the israel matching conditions. we examine the restrictions
that these conditions place on extreme and non-extreme solutions and nd
that they rule out some of the supersymmetric solutions given by bergshoe
et al. we consider what happens when the dilaton varies on the worldvolume
of the brane, which implies that the brane is no longer static. we obtain a
family of d8-brane solutions parametrized by a non-extremality term on each
side of the brane and the asymptotic values of the 10-form eld. the non-
extremality parameters can be related to the velocity of the brane. we also
study 8-brane solutions of a massive iia supergravity theory introduced by
howe, lambert and west. this theory also admits a 10-form formulation, but
the 10-form is not a r-r sector eld and so these 8-branes are not d-branes.

i. introduction

perhaps the most important thing which string duality teaches us is that in order to have
a consistent string theory we have to include objects known as d-branes. these d-branes,
which are just hyperplanes where open strings are allowed to end, were shown by polchinski
[1] to be the carriers of ten dimensional ramond-ramond (r-r) charge. t-duality requires
the existence of d-branes [2] and, once stringy eects are taken into account, the d-branes
become dynamical objects. indeed, the collective coordinates for the transverse uctuations
of a d-brane are just the massless open string excitations that live on the brane worldvolume.
once one recognizes the existence of d-branes, it is natural to start asking questions
about their gross kinematical and/or dynamical properties. for example, is there any con-
straint on the topology of these branes? what happens when we push a brane away from
extremality? can these branes rip, or tear, by some semi-classical decay process analagous
to the decay of cosmic strings (by black hole pair creation)?

before proceeding with the principal construction, it is useful if we rst recall some basic
facts about d-branes [3]. to begin, let us focus just on the bosonic terms in the eective eld
theory actions which arise from the iia and iib string theories. these eld theories are of
course just the type iia and type iib supergravity theories. in the neveu-schwarz-neveu-
schwarz(ns-ns) sector these two theories have identical eld content, consisting of a metric
tensor gij, an antisymmetric rank two tensor potential bij and a scalar dilaton eld . on
the other hand, in the ramond-ramond (r-r) sector the eld content of the two theories
is quite dierent. explicitly, the bosonic sector for the eective action of iia supergravity
is given as1

three-form eld strength. the string coupling gs is given in terms of the dilaton by the
relation gs = e. thus, in both of the above actions the ns-ns sector is multiplied by a
2; this means that ns-ns eects arise in ordinary string perturbation theory.
factor of gs
on the other hand, the r-r terms are not multiplied by any such factor and so we know that
fundamental string states do not carry r-r gauge charges. as we have already mentioned,
the mystery of the r-r gauge elds was resolved when it was shown that r-r charge was
carried by the topological defects known as d-branes [1].

these actions do not tell the whole story about d-brane congurations. this is because
they really only tell us about what life is like for massless closed string states which exist o
the d-branes and how these states couple to the d-branes. for this reason, the supergravity
eective actions are called the bulk terms. there should also be an eective description
of life on the brane worldvolume. indeed, such an eective world-volume action (denoted
sw v ) does exist and it is characterized by a d(p)-brane tension, p, and r-r charge density
form fp as shown below:

sw v = pz dp+1eqdet(h + b + 2f)  f(p)z dp+1a(p+1)

(1.3)

here,  denotes the coordinates tangent to the brane worldvolume, h, b and  are the
pullback of the (respective) spacetime elds to the brane worldvolume. f is an ordinary
maxwell gauge eld which lives on the brane worldvolume. again, a(p+1) is an antisymmetric
(p + 1)-form r-r potential which couples naturally to the p-brane worldvolume (hence the
appearance of the r-r charge density f(p)). this form of the action is very useful if one is
interested in studying light branes, which have negligible gravitational elds (so that one
can ignore the bulk supergravity contributions). in this limit a beautiful picture emerges,
in which fundamental strings ending on a d-brane appear, from the point of view of the
brane worldvolume theory, as coulomb-like point particle solutions of the born-infeld theory
on the brane (gibbons refers to all such solitonic congurations in born-infeld theory as
bions) [4,5]. similarly, one can also think of an m2 brane ending on an m5 brane as
a vortex-type bion living on the m5 brane worldvolume, and so on. while these are
certainly beautiful and promising results, it is still important to understand how strings and
branes in general will interact when they are heavy i.e. the eects of gravity are taken into
account. presumably, addressing this problem will have to involve somehow writing down
an eective action which interpolates between the world-volume and bulk terms as gravity
is turned up. in this paper, we consider the simpler problem of how the world-volume and
bulk terms interact with each other when the branes gravitate.

we concentrate on the case of d8-branes of massive iia supergravity because we can then
use the theory developed in [6] to solve the equations of motion of the coupled worldvolume-
bulk system for moving branes. d8-branes can be viewed as domain walls, which have been
extensively studied in cosmology and supergravity. the gravitational eects of a domain
wall are described by the israel equations which are discussed in section ii. the massive
iia supergravity theory and its d8 branes are described in iii. in section iv we give our
solutions describing moving d8 branes. section v describes dynamic branes of a dierent
massive iia supergravity and we conclude in section vi.

ii. the israel matching conditions and dynamic dilatonic

domain walls

the fact that 8-branes divide ten-dimensional spacetime up into domains is reminiscent
of domain walls in cosmology. as is well known, various cosmological models assume that a
variety of phase transitions took place in the early universe. in such transitions, symmetries
which are only valid at high temperatures are broken as the universe cools down. bubbles
of the new phase are nucleated in regions of the old phase and may expand; if the rate
of production of these bubbles is not diluted by the rate of expansion of the universe, the
process of bubble nucleation, expansion and amalgamation will continue until the universe
is lled with new phase (with perhaps a few bubbles of the old phase left over). when the
new phase lls the entire universe, the transition is said to be complete.

the dynamical evolution of these bubbles when the eects of gravity are included, has
been studied by a number of authors [7,8]. these studies involve understanding the einstein
equations when the source is a thin shell, or domain wall. in such situations, the spacetime
has low dierentiability and one has to regard the curvature as a distribution. it was shown
long ago [9] that the correct formalism for studying such a problem involves constructing
metric junction conditions for the thin shells. these junction conditions, commonly referred
to as the israel matching conditions, state the discontinuity in the extrinsic curvature of
the shell is related to the energy-momentum tensor tab of the matter on the shell by

[kab  khab] = 8gtab,

(2.1)

where k denotes the trace of the extrinsic curvature kab and hab is the induced metric on
the shell. a simple derivation of this equation is given in [6]. thus the energy momentum of
an idealized domain wall gives rise to a jump in the extrinsic curvature of surfaces parallel to
the wall as one moves through the wall. these conditions are easily satised when the only
bulk energy density comes from a cosmological constant and the energy density of the wall
is constant. in supergravity theories one typically has scalar elds present that couple to
domain walls and until recently solutions had only been found when these elds are constant
over the worldvolume of the wall [1012]. a method for dealing with the case of non-constant
worldvolume elds was given in [6]. if one assumes that the bulk on both sides of the wall is
static then consistency of the israel conditions yields non-trivial relationships between the
metric in the bulk and the matter on the wall. these can be used to solve the einstein
equations in the bulk. the resulting spacetime usually contains cosmological horizons so,
although one starts from a static ansatz, the spacetime is actually time-dependent. we will
use these results when we describe the dynamic branes of the romans theory because there
the dilaton has a liouville potential and therefore has to run in the bulk.

iii. d8 branes and the romans theory

the d8-brane of iia string theory couples to the ten-form eld strength f10 of the r-r
sector. as polchinski [1] pointed out, this ten-form is not a dynamical variable; rather, it
is just a constant eld which generates a uniform physical energy density which permeates
space. this energy density is proportional to the square of the mass term of the massive iia

4

supergravity theory derived by romans [13]. in this theory, the mass arises from a higgs
mechanism in which the two-form eats the vector.

the ten form formulation of the romans massive iia supergravity was given by
bergshoe et al. [14]. for our purposes the relevant part of the action in the string frame is

s =

m 2(cid:19) +

mf(10),

(3.1)

where m is an auxiliary eld which can be eliminated via its equation of motion. the
einstein frame metric is given by g(e)

ab . in this frame the action is

ab = e/2g(s)

s =

mf(10).

(3.2)

we shall set  = 1. the ten form is given in terms of its nine form potential by f(10) =
10da(9). varying a(9) gives m = const. and varying m gives f(10) = 10me5/2(10) where
(10) is the volume form of the spacetime. note that varying the metric does not aect the
nal term. therefore the einstein equations are the same as those for which the only matter
is a scalar eld  with potential

v () =

1
4

m 2e5/2.

the relevant part of the d8 brane string frame action is [3]

sbrane = z d9he  z a(9),

(3.3)

(3.4)

where h is determinant of the induced metric on the brane world volume and the nal term
involves the pull back of the bulk nine form potential to the branes world volume. the
upper sign refers to a brane and the lower sign to an anti-brane. in the einstein frame the
action is

where

sbrane = z d9

h v ()  z a(9)

v () = e5/4.

(3.5)

(3.6)

note that the nal (wess-zumino) term is independent of the metric so it does not contribute
to the world volume energy momentum of the brane and therefore does not occur in the
israel equations. however the brane is a source for the ten form so we expect f(10) to have
a discontinuity at the brane arising from this term. to see this, vary a(9) in the total action
sbulk + sbrane to obtain the surface term

(3.7)

where we refer to the bulk regions on the two sides of the brane as (+) and () and
[m]  [m]+
 denotes the discontinuity of m at the brane2. if this term is to vanish then we
need

[m] = 2,

(3.8)

which relates the jump in the eld strength to the charge of the brane.

there will also be a discontinuity in the normal derivative of the dilaton at the brane.

varying the dilaton gives a surface term

(3.10)

this equation ensures that energy-momentum is conserved as the brane moves through
regions of varying  [6].

iv. dynamic d8-branes of the romans theory

we can apply the method developed in [6] to solve the equations of motion of the coupled
brane-bulk system. the starting point is the assumption that the metric is static on both
sides of the brane.
it will turn out that this assumption is less restrictive than it may
seem because the bulk spacetime typically contains cosmological horizons beyond which it
is manifestly time dependent. we shall assume that on each side the bulk metric can be
written

ds2 = u(r)dt2

 + u(r)1dr2

 + r(r)2d2
k,

(4.1)

where d2
k is the line element on an eight dimensional einstein space with metric gmn and
ricci tensor rmn = 7kgmn with k  {1, 0, 1}. the dilaton is assumed to be a function
only of r. the bulk eld equations (i.e. the einstein equations and the dilaton equation of
motion) for this ansatz were given in [6]3. let the brane position be t = t( ), r = r( )

2 the signs are determined as follows. choose an oriented atlas for the whole spacetime (including
the brane) and consider a chart xa dened in a neighbourhood of the brane such that the brane is
at x9 = 0. let (+) denote the region x9 < 0, () the region x9 > 0 and n the outward unit normal
to the (+) region. the volume form of the bulk at the brane is (9)  n where (9) is the volume
form of the brane world volume.
3the equations in [6] use the rescaled dilaton /2.

6

where  denotes proper time of an observer at rest relative to the spatial sections of the
brane i.e. the induced metric on the brane take the friedmann-robertson-walker form

ds2 = d 2 + r( )d2
k.

(4.2)

continuity of the metric at the brane requires that r+(r+( )) = r(r( )) = r( ). hence-
forth we shall drop the  subscripts except where this might cause confusion.

the proper velocity of the brane is

ua =  u 1e,

dr
d

, 0, . . . , 0! ,

(4.3)

where  = +1 when u(r) > 0 i.e. when t is a time coordinate.
if t becomes a spatial
coordinate (e.g. after crossing a horizon) then  = 1. the quantity e is the energy per
unit mass of a particle comoving with the brane

(4.11)

the similarity of these two equations allows us to relate  and r. note that d/dr must
be continuous across the brane and that

this can be substituted into equation 4.11 and compared with equations 4.10 to yield

(4.13)

this equation has to hold at every point visited by the brane so if the brane moves through
a range of r then it can be integrated to yield  as function of r.

(4.15)

in [6] the bulk spacetime was assumed to be symmetric under reection in the brane.
consistency of the 00 and ij components of the israel equations was then shown to reduce
to a condition relating r and v . this argument does not appear possible here without
appealing to the bulk eld equations4, which is what we shall now do. one of the einstein
equations can be written [6]

r

combining this with equation 4.13 and integrating gives

r

(r) = c v ((r)),

(4.16)

(4.17)

where c are constants of integration. equations 4.13 and 4.17 relate the bulk metric and
dilaton. it is easily veried that these, together with equation 4.10 ensure that equation
4.14 is satised.

4we would need to show that x is continuous across the brane, allowing us to take it outside
the square brackets in equation 4.14 and then use equation 4.10 to eliminate the square brackets.
however it does not appear possible to show that x must take the same value on both sides of the
brane without using the bulk eld equations

8

substituting in the explicit form for v given by equation 3.6 allows one to solve for
r(r) and (r). these can then be substituted into the bulk eld equations to solve
for u(r), as described in [6]. solutions only exist when k = 0 (i.e. for ricci at spatial
sections5). the bulk solution takes the same form on both sides of the brane:

u(r) = 262r1/13



e50/2  2mr8/13

(cid:16)28m 2
r(r) = r1/26
 ,

(r) = 0 

10
13

log r,

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

where 0 and m are constants of integration. continuity of the metric at the brane
requires r+(r+( )) = r(r( )) hence r+( ) = r( ). continuity of the dilaton at the
brane then gives 0+ = 0. we can now drop the  subscripts when referring to r(r), r( )
or (r).
by rescaling the coordinates it is possible to either set 0 = 0 or |m| = 1 whilst
preserving the form for the metric in equation 4.1, so the solutions form a 1-parameter
family. however continuity of the metric of the spatial sections does not permit independent
rescalings on both sides of the brane so it is not in general possible to set |m+| = |m| = 1.
we shall rescale so that 0 = 0. we shall refer to the maximal analytic extension of this
solution as the maximal bulk solution to distinguish it from the solution when the jump in
extrinsic curvature at the brane is taken account of.

the maximal bulk solution is singular at r = 0. the singularity is timelike. if m is
positive then there is a cosmological horizon beyond which r becomes a time coordinate
and the metric non-static. however, as discussed in [6], our solutions remain valid when
the brane crosses a horizon. if m is negative then the solution is static everywhere. when
m = 0 then we recover the supersymmetric solution of bergshoe et al. [14] provided
we take the 8 dimensional spatial sections to be at6. we have therefore found a one-
parameter family of non-extremal generalizations of this supersymmetric solution. note
that the asymptotic (large r) behaviour of the metric is determined by the term involving
m so the non-extremal and supersymmetric solutions have dierent asymptotic behaviour.
it is therefore not possible to dene an energy for the spacetime relative to the extreme
solution by using a surface integral at innity. however m is clearly analagous to a mass
for the spacetime, so for some of our discussion we shall assume that it is positive. if m
also vanishes (so the 10-form vanishes) then our solution becomes degenerate (u = 0).
however it is easy to see that in this case a solution is u = 1 with  and r constant. if

5 in the nomenclature of [6] these would be described as type ii solutions.

6more general supersymmetric solutions have recently been discussed in [15], where it was shown
that some supersymmetry will be preserved if the brane worldvolume is taken to be any ricci at
space admitting a killing spinor.

the 8 dimensional spatial sections (with line element d2

(4.22)

the curly brackets denote a sum over the sides of the wall (i.e. {m} = m+ + m) and we
have used equation 3.8 describing the discontinuity in m at the brane. the equation of
motion is the same as for a particle of unit mass and zero total energy moving in a potential
f (r). the fact that the same coecient  occurs in the born-infeld and wess-zumino
terms of the d8-brane action makes the coecient of a possible r8 term in f (r) vanish.
specifying r, dr/dt+ and dr/dt at a given instant allows one to determine m+ and m
using this equation of motion. in this sense, initial data determines the spacetime geometry.
note that the only dependence of f (r) on m is through the interaction term [m]{m}.
if [m] = 0 then the brane does not notice the jump in m. this is obvious on physical grounds
since the brane is the source for the jump in m and will not move under the inuence of its
own eld.

the equation of motion was obtained by squaring equation 4.10. we must now go back
and check which solutions of the equation of motion are still solutions of the unsquared
equation. this can be written

where

(4.23)

(4.24)

(the upper sign is for a brane and the lower sign for an anti-brane.) there are three possible
solutions to this equation:

y (r) > 2  + = +1,
|y (r)| < 2  + = 1,
y (r) < 2  + = 1,

 = +1,
 = +1,
 = 1.

(4.25)

note that since r can vary, it is possible for  to change sign as the brane moves. this
can happen only when e vanishes, which is only possible if u(r( )) is negative i.e. t is
a spatial coordinate. vanishing e corresponds to dt/d = 0 which can happen if there is

10

a change in the direction of motion of the brane relative to the bulk spatial sections. the
geometrical interpretation of  follows from

 n  r = er.

(4.26)

the left hand side describes how r varies as one approaches the brane from the side into
which n points (i.e. the () side) in a direction perpendicular to the brane. hence if  = +1
then r increases towards the brane on the () side. if  = 1 then r decreases towards
the brane on the () side. on the other side, if + = +1 then r decreases towards the
brane on the (+) side (since n points into the () side) and if + = 1 then r increases
towards the brane on the (+) side. this information tells us which portions of the maximal
bulk solution are relevant on each side of the wall. for example if  = +1 then we would
take the maximal bulk solution, cut it along the brane at r = r( ), t = t( ) and keep the
part for which r increased towards the brane in a perpendicular direction. this would give
us the () bulk region. a similar construction would give the (+) region and the two are
glued together at the brane.
note that it is not possible to have + = +1,  = 1 which corresponds to r decreasing
towards the brane in the perpendicular direction on both sides. this would require a brane
of negative tension.

the following subsections discuss the behaviour of the brane in several cases of interest.

a. static solutions

the simplest case to consider is when the brane is static, by which we mean r( ) is
constant. our method does not necessarily yield all of the solutions in this case since our
bulk solutions were derived by assuming that the brane swept out a range of r in the bulk.
however if we assume that the bulk solution on each side of the brane is part of the maximal
solution found above then we can nd static solutions. our analysis needs modifying in the
static case. the reason for this is the dr/d in the denominator of the 00 component of the
extrinsic curvature, given by equation 4.6. if this term vanishes then we must use

k00 =

u 
2u

,

(4.27)

which can be obtained from equation 4.6 by taking the limit as dr/d  0. subtracting the
ij component of the israel equation from the 00 equation yields

u!# = 0.

substituting in the expressions for u(r) and r(r) then leads to

which has the unique solution x = m+/(2). this then yields r = 0, which is the
singularity. this conclusion can only be avoided if m+ = m = 0. therefore a static
solution exists if, and only if, the bulk on both sides of the brane is supersymmetric.

the supersymmetric maximal bulk solutions are globally static with a timelike naked
singularity at r = 0. it is straightforward to see that any static solution describing a single
d8-brane has to include these singularities. to avoid the singularities at r = 0, r+ has to
decrease towards the brane on the (+) side and r has to decrease towards it on the ()
side. this means that + = +1 and  = 1. however this is the case that was ruled out
above. timelike singularities in dilatonic domain wall spacetimes have been studied in [11].
bergshoe et al. gave supersymmetric congurations of parallel branes with vanishing
10-form on both sides of the stack. this is impossible once the restrictions on  are taken
into account. to see this, start on one side of the conguration, say the left side, with
vanishing 10-form. let this be the (+) side of the rst brane. then, since m+ = 0 we
have m = 2 (if we use a brane rather than an anti-brane) so y (r) = 2 and hence
 = +1 so r increases towards the brane on the () side. this is the (+) side of the
next brane in the conguration. so for this next brane, m+ = 2 and + = +1 (since r+
decreases towards this new brane). if we now want m = 0 (i.e. vanishing 10-form) on the
other side of the brane then [m] = 2 so it would actually be an anti-brane. it would have
y (r) = 2, which requires + = 1, a contradiction. (intuitively this is because we are
trying to construct a static brane-antibrane conguration with non-vanishing eld strength
between them.) therefore the second brane in the conguration could not be an anti-brane.
hence it must have m = 4, and the argument repeats. one obtains stack of branes with
the 10-form eld strength increasing as each brane as crossed. furthermore r decreases as
each brane is crossed so one must eventually reach the singularity r = 0 in nite proper
distance.

note that is is possible to construct a static brane-antibrane conguration but the eld
strength has to vanish in the region between the brane and anti-brane. so one can have
a brane and anti-brane separated by a region of minkowski space, with the ten-form non-
vanishing (and a timelike singularity) on both sides of the conguration.

b. the case [m] = 0.

the equation of motion for the brane simplies when m+ = m = m. this requires

m > 0. integrating gives

and hence

r( ) = (cid:16)172m||(cid:17)1/17
r( ) = (cid:16)172m||(cid:17)26/17

.

(4.35)

(4.36)

the solutions for positive and negative  are related by time reversal so we shall only
consider the expanding (positive  ) ones. the maximal bulk spacetime has cosmological
horizons beyond which r becomes a time coordinate. at large r, i.e. late times, the metric
can be written

ds2  d 2 +  18/17dx2 +(cid:16)172m||(cid:17)2/17

d2
0,

(4.37)

where x is a rescaling of t and we have replaced r with  . the brane sits at constant x and
is comoving with the spatial sections of this anisotropic cosmological solution. the direction
transverse to the brane expands faster than directions tangential to it.

since the rr eld is produced by d8 branes, it seems reasonable to assume that m
are integer multiples of the brane charge . if we assume that m is an integer multiple of
 then the solution + = 1,  = +1 is only possible for m =  and hence m+ = 
(as usual the upper sign refers to a brane and the lower sign to an anti-brane). this means
that bulk solution is the same on each side of the brane and is symmetric under reection
in the brane.
(all of the solutions in [6] are of this form.) the global structure of the
maximally extended bulk solution is shown in gure 1. there are two possibilities for the
brane trajectory. let x1 denote the region between such a trajectory and the singularity
from which it emerges, and x2 the complement of this region. to deduce which part of this
is relevant when we include the eect of the brane, note that the signs of  require that r
increase towards the brane along its normal. thus x1 is the relevant region. cutting along
the brane and gluing to the mirror image of x1 yields the spacetime produced by the brane.
it includes the timelike naked singularity from which the brane emerges. initially signals
from the brane can reach the singularity but the presence of a horizon prevents this at late
times.

in the non reection symmetric case we can write m+ = (n1) and m = (n +1)
where n is an integer. consider rst the case |n| > 1. the solution has + =  = sign(n)
therefore r must decrease towards the brane on one side and increase towards it on the
other so we need a region of type x2 on one side of the brane and x1 on the other, although
the two regions have dierent values for m 2 and therefore the brane crosses the horizon in
the region with the smaller value of m 2 before it crosses the horizon in the other region.

the cases n = 1,1 are of interest since then the 10 form vanishes on one side of the
brane i.e. the bulk on that side is a solution of massless iia supergravity. in this special case
the cosmological horizon vanishes and r is a time coordinate throughout the massless region.
equation 4.37 then holds exactly throughout this region. there is a spacelike singularity at
 = 0. the region on the other side of the brane is of type x1.

c. the case [m] 6= 0.

m > 0.

when [m] 6= 0 it is no longer possible to nd r( ) explicitly. we shall assume m+ >
consider rst the case m+ = , m = . for small r, the solution is similar to the

[m] = 0 one. however for larger r,

(4.38)

at late times, the bulk solution on each side of the brane is of the cosmological form given
above i.e. the 8 dimensional spatial sections in the bulk perpendicular have scale factor
 1/17. therefore the brane expands faster than the bulk in these directions. this is because
the velocity of the brane in the (spatial) t-direction does not tend to zero at large r as it
did for the [m] = 0 case. for small r, + = 1 and  = +1 but at the critical value

r16 =

+ changes sign. this occurs in the region where t+ is a spatial coordinate and corresponds
to the brane reaching a turning point in the t+-coordinate i.e. changing direction of motion
relative to the spatial sections of the bulk spacetime on the (+) side. there is no such
turning point on the () side. the trajectory of the brane spacetime with respect to the
maximal bulk spacetime corresponding to the (+) side of the brane is shown in gure 2.
considering the signs of  near r = 0 shows that it is the region between the brane and the
singularity from which it emerges that is relevant on both sides of the brane. this means
that the global structure of the resulting brane spacetime is very similar to the [m] = 0 one.
if we consider a brane with vanishing 10-form on the (+) side then we have m+ = 0 and

m = 2 so

f (r) = 

32
2 [m]2r16  m+r32.

(4.40)

the solution for r( ) is qualitatively the same as the solution we have just discussed.
however we now have y (r) > 2 so + =  = +1. on the (+) side of the brane, the

14

fig. 2. trajectory of brane with turning point.

solution is of the cosmological form discussed above and the brane emerges from a spacelike
singularity. on the () side the relevant region of the maximal bulk spacetime is the region
between the brane and the timelike singularity from which it emerges.
note that for certain choices of the parameters, f (r) is positive for small r. this
prevents the brane from either emerging from or colliding with the singularity. for such
cases, the solutions describe branes that collapse down from innite r to non-zero r and
then re-expand. however the most natural choices for m for a single brane are the symmetric
choice m+ = m and the choice for which the 10-form vanishes on one side of the brane.
for these choices f (r) is negative everywhere. positive f (r) presumably corresponds to
there being a background 10-form eld present. since this would have to be produced by
other d8 branes it would lead us to dynamic multi-brane congurations, which we shall not
discuss here.

v. the theory of howe, lambert and west

in the romans theory the mass arises from a higgs mechanism whereby the two-form
eats the vector. however, as howe, lambert and west (hlw) [16] have recently pointed
out there are actually three distinct higgs mechanisms, corresponding to whether the vector
eats the scalar, the two-form eats the vector or the three-form eats the two-form. in this way,
they have constructed a new massive iia supergravity, which has the appealing property
that it can be obtained by compactication of eleven-dimensional minkowski space on a
circle, with the introduction of a wilson line. in this paper, we will always be assuming that
the four-form eld strength (coming from the eleven dimensional supergravity bosonic eld
sector) is turned o. with this caveat, we then obtain the below equations of motion in ten
dimensions for the hlw theory:

where fab = aabbaa as usual. the mass parameter m determines the eective cosmolog-
ical constant generated by the ten-form eld strength. in this paper, we will be simplifying
things by truncating these equations of motion by setting the vector eld to zero:

a(1) = 0

with this assumption, things simplify considerably. indeed, the only non-trivial remaining
equations are the einstein equation:

rab = 360m2e2gab

(5.4)

together with the maxwell equation 5.2, which implies that the dilaton  is a constant.
in other words, if we turn o all of the elds in this theory except for gravity, we simply
recover de sitter spacetime. the eective cosmological constant is then given explicitly in
terms of the mass as

 = 1296m2e2

a. 10-form formulation of the hlw theory

in [16] the authors introduce the exact one form

k = mdy

(5.5)

(in order to avoid annoying numerical factors we have replaced the m of equation 5.4 with
m, where m 2 = m2/630.) this vector is both the tangent vector to the eleventh dimension
(the s1) of m-theory, as well as the form used to dene a new derivative d = d + k. it
is natural to dualize this one-form relative to the eleven-dimensional hodge star operator.
when we do this we obtain a ten-form f10 which is manifestly covariantly constant:

11f10 = k

we can use this 10-form to write down a (truncated) action for the hlw theory. re-
membering that we are always working only with the sector of the hlw theory where the
dilaton is constant, we nd that the string frame action takes the form

s =

10 z d10xg(cid:18)e2(r + 4()2) 

1
2

e4f10

2(cid:19)

(5.6)

16

clearly, the rst thing one notices about this action is the strange factor of e4 which
appears in front of the 10-form. this means that the 10-form of the hlw theory is not a
r-r sector eld and consequently the hlw 8-branes are not d-branes. in fact, this action
teaches us something even stranger: if we match dimensions in (5.5) we nd that the tension
(t) of a brane which couples electrically to f10 must scale as

t  e

in other words, in the hlw theory the 8-branes have a tension that scales with the
string coupling ! 7 since we are interested in the gravitational eects of these objects, we
are implicitly assuming that  is very large in what follows.

our plan now is simple: the eight-brane divides spacetime up into separate domains, and
we use the israel conditions to match these domains correctly. we now turn our attention
to this exercise.

b. spherical phase transition bubbles in the hlw theory

by assumption, we are working in the regime of the hlw theory where the dilaton is
constant. consequently, each side of a hlw 8-brane is a portion of a spacetime which
is a solution of the vacuum einstein equations with positive cosmological constant in ten
dimensions.
in other words, each side of the brane is a portion of de sitter space, or
schwarzschild-de sitter space. in general, we can nd timelike slices of (schwarzschild)-de
sitter spacetime which may correspond to the worldvolumes of homogeneous and isotropic
8-branes with arbitrary spatial curvature. this is unlike the case of d8 branes studied
above, for which we could only nd solutions with ricci at spatial sections. we will focus
on branes with spherical symmetry8.

to do this we simply choose a gauge so that the spherically symmetric ten-dimensional

metric takes the form [19], [18]:

ds2 = f (r)dt2 +

1

f (r)

dr2 + r2d8

2

the most general spherically symmetric vacuum metric in 9 + 1 dimensions will have

f (r) = 1 

c
r7 


36

r2.

(5.7)

(5.8)

this is of course just the metric of schwarzschild-de sitter (sds) spacetime, where  is the
cosmological constant and c is given in terms of the adm mass m mass of the black hole
as follows:

7it is worth pointing out here, that since the 3-form has eaten the 2-form, there is no eld to
which f-strings can couple electrically. in this sense, there are no strings in this theory!

8the general case was studied in an earlier version of this paper [17], where we found all of the
homogeneous and isotropic 8-branes of the hlw theory.

17

c = (

105g
163 )m

actually, we could also leave f non-zero and consider the resulting einstein-maxwell-
dilaton system of equations; we begin with the f = 0 truncation for simplicity.

with this simple picture in mind we can now proceed with the equations of motion. the
equations of motion for a thin spherical shell, which is bounding a region of sds from a
region of a dierent sds spacetime, were worked out for four dimensions in [7]. the analysis
developed there will go through here, because the assumption of spherical symmetry means
that brane motion is described as a system in 1 + 1 dimensions. put more simply, we are
solving for one unknown function, r(t), which describes the radius of the spherical brane at
time t. we will let  denote the surface energy density of the brane. we will also distinguish
between quantities which exist inside of the brane, and those which are outside, by using
subscripts. thus, fin denotes the metric function 5.8 inside the brane, and similarly fout
denotes the same thing outside the brane. the parameters  have the same interpretation
as they had for our d8-brane solutions provided we take the unit normal to point out of
the bubble i.e. the interior of the bubble is the (+) region. with all of this in mind, the
equation of motion for a spherical bubble bounding two dierent (vacuum) phases of the
hlw supergravity theory is given as

in[ r2 + fin(r)]1/2  out[ r2 + fout(r)]1/2 = 


2

r

(5.9)

where r = f 1/2tr denotes the derivative relative to the time experienced by observers
who co-move with the domain wall and  = 8g as always. any solution of this equation
automatically describes an eight-brane worldsheet which satises the israel conditions.

again, it is easy to see that one can generically rearrange the terms in 5.9 so that
the equation of motion for the scale factor is equivalent to the equation of motion for a
particle of unit mass and zero total energy moving in a potential v . the precise form
for v will depend on what one chooses to lie on each side of the 8-brane. because this
is a straightforward generalization of work which has already been done in the setting of
four-dimensional cosmology, we will have nothing more to say about these branes here.

c. semiclassical instabilities of hlw 8-branes

the nucleation and annihilation of bubbles of phase transition in the early universe has
been studied by a number of authors [20], [8], [7], [22]. here, we briey sketch how these
results will also go through for hlw branes.

in [22], the authors calculated the probability that one could create a universe in the
laboratory by quantum tunneling. by this, they meant: what is the probability that a
bubble of false vacuum (i.e., de sitter space) can appear in a lab where we have attained
a super-high mass density of the order 1076 g/cm3? the authors calculated the rate at
which one could create new universes in this way by rst nding an instanton, or imaginary
time path, which interpolates between the initial state (schwarzschild) and the nal state
(schwarzschild with a bubble of de sitter in it), then working out the euclidean action
se for the instanton path and then using the standard semiclassical approximation for the
probability p :

18

crudely, they found that the euclidean action goes like

pese

se1/h 2

where h = ( 
3 )1/2 is the inverse of the hubble radius. this form of the action follows from
the fact that the domain wall sweeps out a three-sphere in imaginary time, and the action
is basically the wall tension times the volume of the three-sphere.

in ten dimensions, an hlw 8-brane sweeps out a nine-sphere in imaginary time;

it
follows that the euclidean action for the nucleation of hlw branes will go like 1/h 8. in
other words, the nucleation of isolated bubbles of massive phase in this iia supergravity
theory will still be highly suppressed.

this shows that hlw branes can be spontaneously nucleated, but what about the time
reverse: how do they annihilate? in a recent paper, kolitch and eardley [20] studied the
decay of vilenkin-ipser-sikivie (vis) [21] domain walls in cosmology. these vis domain
walls are the minkowski-minkowski version of the de sitter-de sitter (ds-ds) hlw branes
discussed above. that is to say, a vis domain wall is a repulsive spherical bubble which
separates two (compact) portions of minkowski space (just as a ds-ds hlw brane separates
two compact portions of de sitter spacetime). it is not hard to see that their construction
will in fact go through for the ds-ds hlw branes. again, the action for the instanton
describing such an annihilation event will go crudely as 1/h 8.

it is clear that black hole pairs will be nucleated in the presence of the repulsive, ds-ds
spherical hlw branes. this is basically because these ds-ds branes are bubbles bounding
two regions of inationary phase, and we know that black holes will be produced in an
inating (or domain wall [23]) background. of course, just about anything can be produced
in an inationary background, simply because the repulsive gravitational energy is a natural
source capable of pulling virtual loops of matter out of the vacuum. in particular, it is well
known that topological defects [24] will also be nucleated in ination. typically, a defect
nucleates at the hubble radius r = h 1. if the defect is much thinner than the scale of the
universe at the moment of nucleation, it makes sense to model the defect using the nambu
action. that is, it makes sense to assume that the defect is innitely thin, and to dene
the action to be the area of the worldvolume swept out by the defect (multiplied by the
characteristic tension, or mass, of the defect). in this limit, the instanton for a loop of string
is a two-sphere of radius h 1. similarly, the instanton for a (closed) spherical domain wall
is a three-sphere of radius h 1, and so on. thus, the euclidean action for defect nucleation
generically has the form

se = v ol(sn(1/h))

where v ol(sn(1/h)) denotes the volume of an n-sphere of radius 1/h, and  denotes the
mass of the monopoles (if n = 1), the tension of the string loop (if n = 2) or the energy
density of the domain wall (if n = 3). one therefore nds that the rate of production of these
defects is strongly suppressed if the defect tension is very large, or the cosmological constant
is very small, as would be expected. similarly, light defects are likely to be produced in a
background with a large cosmological constant.

19

vi. conclusion

we have found solutions of the coupled bulk-worldvolume theory which describe the
motion of a d8-brane in massive iia supergravity. since the dilaton is running in any such
background, it follows that the energy-momentum carried by that eld is allowed to move
from the brane to the bulk and vice-versa. we have also shown that whenever a d8-brane
starts to move, a non-extremality term will necessarily appear in the bulk on both sides of
the brane. this term obstructs the existence of killing spinors and therefore breaks any
supersymmetry which was initially present. the spacetime on either side of the brane at
late times is typically an anisotropic cosmological solution with the direction transverse to
the brane expanding faster than the directions tangential to it. when the non-extremality
parameter is the same on both sides of the brane the brane eventually becomes comoving
with the bulk. if the non-extremality parameters are not the same then the brane always
moves relative to the bulk.

use of the israel conditions also places constraints on supersymmetric solutions. we have
shown that it is not possible to exclude the singularity from a supersymmetric d8-brane
spacetime (unless one introduces objects of negative tension, such as orientifold planes). we
have also shown that it is impossible to construct a conguration of parallel d8 branes (or
anti-branes) that is a solution of the massless iia theory in the two asymptotic regions.

we have also discussed branes in the howe-lambert-west theory. unlike our d8 brane
solutions, these can have spatial sections with ricci curvature, and such spherical branes
might be relevant for the study of phase transitions in the supergravity theory. it would
be interesting to see if spherical d8 brane solutions could be found, although this would
probably have to be done numerically. if such solutions exist then they could describe the
evolution of a bubble of the massive phase of iia supergravity surrounded by the massless
phase.

perhaps the most exciting thing which these results teach us is that it is possible to
describe gravitating brane congurations without losing sight of the brane worldvolume.
to put it another way, there is nothing to stop one from dening an eective worldvolume
action for these gravitating d8-branes (presumably the born-infeld-dirac action will do),
and studying these branes from the worldvolume point of view. again, since the dilaton will
ow into the bulk, there will be an anomaly in the stress-energy conservation equation for
the worldvolume theory. it would be amusing to see how this is related to the breakdown
of supersymmetry.

this should be contrasted to other heavy, or gravitating, brane congurations in su-
pergravity theories, such as the non-dilatonic p-branes [25]. there, the brane worldvolume
vanishes, leaving a geometry which looks rather like a black hole (extended in some ex-
tra dimensions), such that the solution interpolates between dierent vacua (generically
minkowski spacetime far from the brane, and (ads)p+2sdp2 near the brane [25]). in
these solutions, there is no brane to be found and it is therefore meaningless to talk about
worldvolume actions.

the results [4,5] concerning how a string ending on a d-brane will tug on the brane beg
the question: how will a heavy string tug on a heavy d8-brane? one has to be careful in
posing this question, since it is not at all clear that the method of assigning distributional
curvatures to spacetimes of low dierentiability (i.e.
imposing the israel conditions) will

20

still make sense when one is dealing with extended objects of codimension greater than one.
research into these problems is currently underway.
