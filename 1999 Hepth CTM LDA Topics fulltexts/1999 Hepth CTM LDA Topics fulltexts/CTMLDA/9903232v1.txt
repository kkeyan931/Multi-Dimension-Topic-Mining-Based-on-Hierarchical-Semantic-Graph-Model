abstract:

we review interactions between certain 7-planes which are composed out of mutu-
ally non-local (p, q) 7-branes and which correspond to specic kodaira singularities. we
discuss in particular how to compute certain moduli-dependent terms in the eective ac-
tion. these do not only probe the local chern-simons terms on the world-volumina, but
also certain global aspects of plane interactions that can be attributed to torsion (or
zzn -valued) d-brane charges.

introduction

when studying interactions between d-branes, one usually considers idealized situations
where one focuses one a single pair of (possibly stacks of) branes. however, for making
quantitative tests of string dualities, the global structure of d-branes interactions become
important as well  that is, the inuence of all the other branes that are usually considered
as far away. the purpose of this contribution is to elucidate some aspects of such global
interactions, reviewing part of ref. [1] but also slightly expanding upon some of the
points.

the theory we are concretely interested in here is f -theory compactication on k3,
which amounts to type iib compactication on ip1 with 24 7-branes [2]. this theory is
dual to the heterotic string on t 2, where certain anomaly-related pieces of the eective
action can be computed exactly at one-loop order. this fact provides an ideal framework
for studying non-trivial brane interactions;
in the past, it has been very successfully
applied to study brane interactions in type i and matrix strings (see eg., [3, 4, 5]).

obviously, one cannot expect to compute any given piece of the eective lagrangian
exactly; it is just very special couplings, namely typically those which are anomaly-related
and/or to which only bps-states contribute, that are amenable to an exact treatment.
in the present situation with 16 supercharges in eight dimensions, the canonical bps-
saturated amplitudes [6, 7] involve four external gauge bosons (and/or gravitons). su-
persymmetry relates parity even (i f n) and parity odd ( 
2 f  f  ..f ) sectors, and
therefore one can conveniently combine the theta-angle and the coupling constant  into

one complex coupling, e . in particular, when compactifying the heterotic string on t 2,
the eective couplings e(t, u)  i(t, u) + 1
2 (t, u) become highly non-trivial func-
tions depending on the usual torus moduli t and u. as mentioned before, in the heterotic
string picture the couplings are exact at one-loop order, and are in fact directly related

[6] to the heterotic elliptic genus ba(f, r, q) [8]. schematically:

re[e (t, u)] f  ...f  z d2

z(2,2)(t, u, q, q) ba(f, r, q)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 8form

where z(2,2) is the partition function of the two-torus t 2 (we will switch o the wilson
lines, or set them to certain constant values). the evaluation of such integrals has been
discussed at length in [9, 4, 1, 10], and results in certain borcherds-type of modular
functions. the resulting expressions have been interpreted in terms of type i string
language [3, 4, 5], in which one has been able to identify both perturbative and non-
perturbative (d-instanton) contributions. on the other hand, an interpretation in terms
of f -theory geometry was given in refs. [1, 10, 11], and this is what we will partially
review below.

2 chern-simons couplings on 7-planes

the issue is to compute the functions e(t, u) (1) via 7-brane interactions. while in
general very complicated, these interactions in the present context reasonably tractable
because of their special anomaly related, parity-odd structure. they arise from the chern-
simons terms on the world-volumina of the 7-branes, via the exchange of rr antisym-
metric tensor elds c (p). for a single d-brane, the relevant tree level couplings look [12]
(for trivial normal bundle):

l(cs)

d7 = c  e2if q ba(r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 8form

,

(2)

where c  4

k=0c (2k) is the formal sum over all rr forms, and ba(r) is the dirac genus.

note that due to the generic mutual non-locality of the 24 (p, q) 7-branes, it is a priori
not clear how to add up these terms, and much less, how to determine what eective
interactions they induce. however, what we can do is simply to restrict to sub-moduli
spaces where the 24 branes combine into certain objects (7-planes) that are all mutually
local, ie., have commuting monodromies. particularly simple are the sub-cases where the
monodromies not only commute, but are also of nite order. these correspond to theories
where the 7-brane charge is cancelled locally, such that the type iib string coupling s, is
constant over the ip1 base (the z-plane). there are three such possibilities for splitting
up the 24 7-branes [13, 14]:
ii) s = i: into eight h1-planes (ve remaining moduli)
ii) s =   e2i/3: into twelve h0-planes (nine remaining moduli)
iii) s =arbitrary constant:
intersects branches ii) and iii)).

into four d4-planes (one remaining modulus; this branch

here hn denotes 7-planes associated with the kodaira elliptic singularity types [15] of
the same name; they carry gauge symmetries of type an (a0  u(1)), respectively. by
further specialization, one can have some or all of the hn branes combine into planes with
larger gauge symmetries; the various possibilities are listed in the following table.

carry net (zz-valued) d-brane charge. they support gauge elds on their world-volumina

composition in terms of basic building blocks, as well as the associated constant type
iib string coupling, s.
(s, t denote the standard generators of the s-duality group,
sl(2, zz).)

because of the mutual locality, the anomalous couplings can be very simply determined.
for this we recall that a d4-plane can be viewed as being composed out of four d7-
branes plus one orientifold plane, which all are mutually local. since l(cs)

where in the last line the gauge eld traces follow implicitly from the decomposition
so(8)  u(1) or su(2), respectively. indeed, summing over all world-volumina exactly
reproduces the (eight dimensional remainder of the) green-schwarz term of the heterotic
string, l(gs) = c (6) 2(r2trfso(32)

2)+c (2)x8(fso(32), r).

3 geometric interactions

what we are interested in are the non-trivial interactions between the planes, which should
ultimately reproduce the coupling functions e(t, u) that were schematically computed
in (1). the primary perturbative contributions will arise from strings stretched between
the various planes, which amounts to c (p) tensor eld exchange between individual planes.
the eective interaction will thus depend on the distances between the various 7-planes in
the z-plane. more specically, the closed string exchange that contributes to the maximal
number of wedge products of eld strengths is in the odd rr sector, and is proportional
to the greens function  of a scalar eld on the z-plane. schematically,2

where (z1, z2) = ln(z1  z2) + nite .

(4)

the dependence of the plane locations zi on t, u is complicated, but can be obtained via
the k3 mirror map, as explained in ref. [1, 10].

however, in order to obtain functionally exact results, we need to know the full greens
functions that probe the global structure of the z-plane, and not just their leading singular
behavior. this is in general a complicated problem, but in our setup, where we consider

2for a more precise discussion, see eg. [17].

only planes with nite order monodromies, there is a natural geometric answer [1, 10].
this is because the branch cuts in the z-plane are of nite order, and therefore the
geometry is eectively the one of riemann surfaces   see fig.1 (indeed the geodesic

lengths of strings stretching in the z-plane, given by r z2

given by the periods of ).

two e6 and two h2 planes, which correspond to zz3 twist elds and anti-twist elds, respectively,
located at the branch points of a genus two curve 2. we also show a closed string trajectory that
contributes to the coupling trfsu(3)

2, and which corresponds to a 1/3period on 2.

2trfsu(3)

accordingly, canonical greens functions are given by the ones of scalar elds on the
covering surfaces : those are known to be given by the logarithm of the prime form.
however, it turns out [10] that these canonical greens functions on  to not capture the
full story; they capture only the perturbative piece of the interactions. in fact, a greens
function is ambiguous up to the addition of nite pieces, and indeed there are in general
further non-singular non-perturbative corrections to the naive greens functions, arising
from wrapping string world-sheets on . it was shown in [10] how the non-perturbative
greens functions between pairs of branch points can be computed exactly by solving
certain dierential equations.

due to lack of space, we will consider in the following mainly the interactions of model
iii), which is sens model with so(8)4 gauge symmetry. here four d4 7-branes create
two zz2 branch cuts, so that the covering space is just a torus,  = t 2. the situation
is especially simple also because the non-perturbative, u-dependent contributions factor
out, so that the naive greens functions on the torus give the full result (as far as the t -
dependence is concerned3). more explicitly, the (harmonic parts of the) greens functions
between the four branch points are given by

12 = 34 = lnh 2(2t )



1(2t )i, 13 = 24 = lnh 3(2t )

1(2t )i, 14 = 23 = lnh 4(2t )
1(2t )i.

integrating out c (4) exchange between the chern-simons couplings in (3) therefore im-
mediately yields the following terms in the eective action:

these can be seen [1] to match exactly the heterotic one-loop couplings (with the ap-
propriate wilson lines switched on) ! similarly, by summing up c (4) exchange between
3this is reected by the fact that the z-plane geometry does not depend on the modulus u , which plays the role of s .
non-trivial u -dependence is induced by d-instantons, to the eect that c(0) in (3) is renormalized into const ln |(u )|4.
this can be seen by comparing to the u -dependence as computed on the heterotic side [1].

any given brane and all the other ones, the contribution to trf 2

so(8)1trr2 is given by

i=2 1i(t )  ln[(2t )]  this again matches the heterotic result.

4 global interactions from cyclic d-brane charges

there are moduli-dependent corrections also to other eight-form terms in the eective
action, eg., to (trf 2)2 and trr4 (again, we will focus here only on the perturbative,
potentially singular contributions). in the usually considered situation, where one focuses
on pairs of d- or orientifold-branes [16, 17, 18], such terms arise from integrating out
c (0) c (8) exchange between the two branes, each equipped with couplings like l(cs) =
q7  c (8) + . . . + c (0)  y8(f, r), where y8 is some 8-form. however, in the present context,
the 7-brane charge is cancelled locally on every plane so that q7  0. this means that
naive c (0)  c (8) exchange cannot contribute to these couplings, a fact that has been
slightly mis-stated in ref. [1]. but how do these moduli-dependent corrections then arise ?
the point is that despite our 7-planes do not have net zz-valued d-brane charge (no
logarithmic monodromy), there is still a remnant left, which is reected by the nite order
zzn monodromies. it is this torsion piece of the d-brane charge that is responsible for
the requisite long-range interactions. this can be seen by analyzing the interactions in
terms of string junctions [19] (with the appropriate quantum numbers so as to contribute
to the terms in question). similar to what is familiar from orientifold planes, what one
nds are string trajectories that loop around other planes and do not couple to them via
the local chern-simons terms in (3); see fig.2.

is shown that contributes to (trfsu(3)
also show how they lift to periods on the covering curve. the junctions give rise to logarithmic
singularities when the planes collide (the actual bps geodesics may look quite dierent, though,
and might involve prongs.)

the question arises to what extent it is possible to represent such interactions in terms
of local couplings on the plane world-volumina. one might imagine pulling the string
loop through the plane location, thereby creating a prong that ends on the plane and
thus might have a local coupling to it. indeed for d4 7-planes, which are related to zz2
orientifold planes, the interaction can be treated in conformal eld theory, where it can be
represented by a cross cap vertex localized on the plane. on the other hand, for the zzn
generalizations listed in table 1, there is no conformal eld theory description because
these 7-planes are associated with strong (and frozen) type iib coupling, s. it thus seems
more natural to view these interactions not in terms of localized couplings, but rather as

tions as before. that is, adding up all the relevant exchanges, we obtain p4

at any rate, the heterotic string computation tells exactly what the answer must be,
and it turns out that we obtain the correct result if we simply take the same greens func-
i=2 1i(t ) 
ln[(2t )](trf 2
so(8)1)2, and the same functional form as well for (trr2)2 and trr4; up to
normalization, this indeed reproduces the heterotic one-loop couplings. note that the
closed loops in the z-plane that contribute to the gravitational couplings lift to elliptic
curves in the k3, which is consistent with the expectation that gravitational couplings
are not corrected at type iib closed string tree level.

we hope that the above considerations will be relevant in a broader context, perhaps in
the k-theoretic approach [21] to generalized d-brane charges, where indeed zzn charges
play an important role. we may also present more detailed results elsewhere.
