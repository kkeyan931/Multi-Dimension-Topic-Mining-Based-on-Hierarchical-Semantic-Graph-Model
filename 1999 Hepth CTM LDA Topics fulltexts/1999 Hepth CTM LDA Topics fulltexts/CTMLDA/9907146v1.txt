abstract

it is argued that quantum traveling of d-particles in the limit   0 presents
the joining-splitting processes of eld theory feynman graphs. the amplitudes in
d dimensions can be corresponded with those of a d + 2 dimensional theory in the
light-cone frame. also it is shown that this light-cone formulation enables to study
processes with arbitrary longitudinal momentum transfers.
it is discussed that a
massless sector exists which can be taken as the low energy limit. by taking the con-
stant relative distances in the bound-states we nd a spectrum for the intermediatory
elds.

1 introduction

perturbative string theory is dened by series expansions based on the topologies of the
string world-sheet with the weights proportional to the action of string. the perturba-
tion series can be presented as sum over dierent graphs which describe the joining-
splitting(js) processes of strings as events in space-time. in fact these graphs are those
which should be obtained as feynman graphs of a string eld theory. in spite of the ab-
sence of a complete string eld theory, those graphs which are produced by small strings
(i.e. in   0 limit) correspond to well known particle eld theories namely various (super)
gravity and gauge theories. so basically one expects to have a similar interpretation for js
processes of particles and corresponding particle eld theory graphs.

on the other hand through the developments of the understanding of m-theory as a
m(atrix) model [1], a description of perturbative light-cone string theory was achieved
based on a non-abelian gauge theory living on a 2d cylinder which in most times can
be interpreted as the world-sheet of free strings. this description was mentioned in [2, 3],
more concreted in [4], and has been checked to produce the well known amplitudes in string
theory [5, 6]. besides in [7] (see also [8]) it was argued that congurations with dierent

lengths of strings and their js processes are corresponded to various backgrounds of world-
sheet (gauge) elds. by the above picture for feynman graphs of strings, it is the purpose
of this article to present similar ones for d-particles.

we argue that quantum traveling of d-particles , in the limit   0, can be corre-
sponded to graphs of a certain particle eld theory and their amplitudes in the light-cone
frame . so it provides the possibility to probe a particle eld theory by its feynman
graphs, those generated by js processes of d-particles. let us dene the problem in more
details.

dp-branes are p dimensional objects which are dened as (hyper)surfaces which can trap
the ends of strings [9]. one of the most interesting aspects of d-brane dynamics appears in
their coincident limit. in the case of coinciding n dp-branes in a (super)string theory, their
dynamics are captured by a dimensionally reduced u(n) (s)ym theory from (9+1)25+1
to p + 1 dimensions of dp-brane world-volume [10, 9].

for d-particles (p = 0) since only time exists in the world-line the above dynamics
reduces to quantum mechanics of matrices. the bosonic part of the corresponding action
is [1, 11, 12]

s = m0z tr (cid:18)1

2 and m0 = (gs)1 are the string tension and the mass of d-particles respec-
where
tively, and gs is string coupling. here dt = t  ia0 acts as covariant derivative in the 0+1
dimensional gauge theory.

for n d-particles xs are in adjoint representation of u(n) and have the usual expan-

sion xi = xiata, a = 1,  , n 2, where tas are basis of the u(n) algebra.

in fact this action is the result of the string theory calculation of d-brane interactions

in the so-called gauge theory limit, dened by:

gs  0,
ls  0,

s

= xed,

(1.2)

where v and r are the relative velocities and distances involved in the kinematics of d-branes
and ls =  is the string length.

firstly let us search for d-particles in the above lagrangian:

for each direction i there are n 2 variables instead of n which one expects for n particles.
however there is a solution for the equations of motion which restricts the t(a) basis to

more precisely, because the approach is for nite number of longitudinal momentum quanta (m0 = p+)
the formulation is in the discrete-light-cone-quantization (dlcq) version of the light-cone. however
we do not emphasize on this point any more.

the n dimensional cartan subalgebra. this solution causes vanishing the potential and
one nds the equations of motion for n free particles. in this case the u(n) symmetry is
broken to u(1)n and the interpretation of n remaining variables as the classical relative
positions of n particles is meaningful. the center of mass of d-particles is represented by
the trace of the x matrices and easily can be seen that the momentum of the center of
mass is conserved.

in the case of unbroken gauge symmetry, the n 2n non-cartan elements have a stringy
interpretation. they govern the dynamics of low lying oscillations of strings stretched
between d-particles. although the gauge transformations mix the entries of matrices and
the interpretation of positions for d-particles remains obscure [13], even in this case the
center of mass is meaningful and the ambiguity about positions only comes back to the
relative positions of d-particles.

let us concentrate on the limit   0 . in this limit to have a nite energy one has

to restrict xs to

[xi, xj] = 0,  i, j,

(1.3)

and consequently vanishing the potential term in the action. so d-particles do not interact
and the action reduces to the action of n free particles

s = z dt

xa=1

(1.4)

however the above observation fails when d-particles arrive each other. when two d-
particles come very near each other two eigenvalues of xi matrices will be equal and the
corresponding o-diagonal elements can take non-zero values and still have a nite energy.
in fact this is as the same story of gauge symmetry enhancement. so one may deduce
that in the limit   0 d-particles do not interact with each others except for when they
coincide.

for n coincident d-particles one may write the corresponding action and hamiltonian

as,

s = z dt(cid:18)1

h =

+ hint(xa, pa),

(1.5)

(1.6)

in which x and p are the position and momentum of the center of mass and xas and pas are
the non-abelian positions and momentums. lint and hint are responsible for interactions.

here this limit is analogous to the limit gs  0 in [4].

the dependences of energy eigenvalues and the size of bound states are notable. by the

scalings [11, 14]

the length scale ld+2 should be the fundamental length scale of the covariant d + 2 dimen-
sional theory whose light-cone formulation is argued to be action (1.5) . consequently
one nds m0  e  1
which shows invariance under lorentz transformation of this com-
bination. as we will see the mass of the intermediate states appear as  m0  e.

the organization of the article is as follows.

in the next section the correspondence
between d-particle quantum mechanics and the light-cone eld theory amplitudes is pre-
sented. section 3 is devoted to specication of the eld theory in more details by estimating
the mass of the intermediate states.

2 d-particle feynman graphs

2.1 amplitudes in   0 limit- two d-particles case

take the probability amplitude corresponded to detect two d-particles in positions x1 and
x2 at time ti and in x3 and x4 at time tf , presented by path integral as

hx3, x4; tf|x1, x2; tii = z es.

(2.1)

in the limit   0 in that parts of paths which d-particles are not coincident, only the
diagonal matrices have contribution to the path integral. this is because of large value of
action in the exponential. so the action in the path integral reduces to the action of two
free d-particles for non-coincident parts of paths, e.g. (x1, x2) till x1 in fig.1. accordingly
one may write (fig.1) ,

hx3, x4; tf|x1, x2; tii = (cid:20)z es(cid:21)0

in the case d = 9 this length is known to be the 11-dimensional planck length.
here as in eld theory we have dropped the dis-connected graphs. this work can be done by subtracting

the contribution of paths corresponded to free moving of d-particles.

2.2 amplitudes in   0 limit- n d-particles case

due to momentum conservation, n-particle states in light-cone frame have np+ longitu-
dinal momentum. on the other hand the longitudinal momentum of a state plays the role
of the newtonian mass in the transverse space of light-cone frame. so to have n-particle
(normalizable) states the existence of marginal bound-states is necessary. the marginal
bound-states are dened by ebinding = 0. so the energy-mass equivalence relation for them
is read as

e = mn = n  m0

(2.9)

which in light-cone case we have m0 = p+. the existence of marginal bound-states in
d-particle case is claried in [16]. due to a linearly rising potential between d-particles, it
is discussed that the zero-energy wave function of d-particles is corresponded to extremely
near d-particles [16]. so these bound-states can be treated point-like k.

here there are two possibilities to produce specied initial and nal states, the so-called

s- and t-channel processes.

s-channel
as the previous subsection we take the probability amplitude corresponded to detect
four clusters of d-particles those with masses n1m0 and n2m0 in positions x1 and x2 at

kin the supersymmetric case, there are several reports about the existence of these bound-states [17].

(2.10)

(2.11)

again in the limit   0 we have non-interacting clusters in non-coincident parts of paths.
accordingly one writes (fig.2)

between (y1, t1) and (y2, t2) , and kint is the corresponding propagator for the non-abelian
path integrations over lint(xa, xa) .
in the above it is assumed that the group u(1) 
su(n1)  su(n2) for the position matrices is enhanced as u(1)  su(n) at time t1 and
is broken to u(1)  su(n3)  su(n4) at time t2.

(2.17)

with the denitions mentioned earlier. in this channel as is specied in fig.3 in contrast to
s-channel we have t1 > t2. because of absence of anti-particles in the light-cone frame the
direction of time is unique. so for every propagation of particles, e.g. intermediate states,
propagations are from smaller time to bigger ones.

3 field theory of feynman graphs

the question of what eld theory? is answered only by knowing the full set of eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian hint dened by,
hint|ni = en|ni.

the knowledge about the spectrum of the interested hamiltonian is restricted. the exis-
tence of zero-energy bound-states is discussed in [16]. it is claried that the zero-energy
bound-states are formed by closely near, in fact identied, d-particles. also it is argued
that the corresponding eigen-function is constant [16]. so the low energy limit of the d + 2
dimensional theory is dened by the zero-energy states.

in the following we discuss another approach, the constant background.

10

3.1 constant background

when two d-particles come very near each other two eigenvalues of xi matrices will become
approximately equal and this makes the possibility that the corresponding o-diagonal
elements take non-zero values.

in the coincident limit the dynamics is complicated. the matrix position may be taken

as:

xi =   xi

y 

yi

i xi! ,

(3.1)

where y  is the complex conjugate of y . by inserting this matrix in the lagrangian one
obtains:

j + o(y 3)(cid:19), (3.2)
s = z dt
with x for the center of mass and  is the angle between ~x and the complex vector ~y .
as is apparent in the limit   0 which is in our direct interest the x element can not
take large values and have a small range of variation. in high-tension approximation of
strings, one takes the relative distance of d-particles constant and of order of bound-state
size x  g1/3

where in the above k is an  independent numerical factor, and y is the perpendicular
part of the ~y to the relative distance ~x. the parallel part of ~y behaves as a free part.
in d + 1 dimensions of space-time the dimension of y is d  1 which shows that we
are encountered with 2  (d  1) harmonic oscillators because, y is a complex variable .
these harmonic oscillators are corresponded to vibrations of oriented open strings stretched
between d-particles.

by translating all the above to the momentum space and doing the integrals it is found

4 conclusion and discussion

it is argued in this work that the quantum mechanics of d-particles in d dimensions can
be corresponded to dlcq formulation of a d + 2 dimensional eld theory. the mass scale
of the d + 2 dimensional theory is found to be g1/3
s /ls. also it is shown that this dlcq
formulation enables to study processes with arbitrary longitudinal momentum transfers. it
is discussed that a massless sector exists which can be taken as the low energy limit of the
d + 2 dimensional theory. by taking the constant relative distances in the bound-states we
found a spectrum for the intermediatory elds.

let us compare our approach and those of the m(atrix) model [1]. in the case of m(atrix)
model, because of large amount of supersymmetry, the d-particle action is trusted even in
large separation of d-particles ( r
s  ) which is denitely beyond the limit in which
l2
the action is expected to be valid. in our approach, in contrast to m(atrix) model, the
dynamics of d-particles is used exactly in the region of kinematical variables where the
action is dened.
it causes that the calculation of d-particle scattering amplitudes can
be performed even in the non-supersymmetric case. the gauge theoretic description of
interactions in bosonic case is supported by the result of [5] for light-cone bosonic strings.
in the supersymmetric case a candidate for the d + 2 dimensional theory can be guessed
by m(atrix) theory approach to m-theory [1]. m-theory and type iia string theory both
have supergravities in their low energy limit in 11 and 10 dimensions respectively. there is a
gauge theoretic description of stringy feynman graphs [2, 3, 4]. since the 10 dimensional
(iia) supergravity is corresponded to stringy feynman graphs in the limit   0, so
one may expect to have a similar relation between d-particles feynman graphs and 11
dimensional supergravity.
