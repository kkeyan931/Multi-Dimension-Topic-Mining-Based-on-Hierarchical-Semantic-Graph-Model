perturbative analysis on infrared and ultraviolet aspects

of noncommutative qed on r4

theory division, kek, tsukuba, ibaraki 305-0801, japan

february 1, 2008

abstract

here we discuss the ultraviolet and infrared aspects of the noncommutative counterpart
of qed, which is called as noncommutative qed, as well as some infrared dynamics of
noncommutative yang-mills (ncym) theory. first we demonstrate that the divergence in
the theory can be subtracted by the similar counterterms as in ordinary theory at one loop
level. then the anomalous magnetic moment is calculated to see the infrared aspect of the
theory which reects the violation of lorentz symmetry. the evaluation of the nite part of
the photon vacuum polarization shows that the logarithmically singular term in the infrared
limit appears with the same weight as uv logarithmic divergence, showing the correlation
between the uv and infrared dynamics in ncym theory. nc-qed theory does not show
such a property. we also consider the extension to chiral gauge theory in the present context,
but the requirement of anomaly cancellation allows only noncommutative qed.

introduction

the analysis of quantum mechanical features of noncommutative eld theory is now being
developed from purely eld theoretical point of view [112]. the common character of noncom-
mutative eld theories is its nonlocality. the product of the operators on the noncommutative
geometry is mapped into the stared (referred to hereafter as -) product on the deformed algebra
of the usual functions. this gives the above momentum-dependent phase factor for each inter-
action vertex which manifests nonlocality of the theory. this phase factor selects the diagrams
with the ultraviolet (uv) divergence since it can serve as an eective cuto of high frequency
modes [2, 6, 9, 10, 12]. as a consequence the uv-divergent diagrams correspond to the pla-
nar diagrams; no phase suppression factors in the noncommutative theory side; the t hooft
diagrams [13] which can be drawn on a plane in the ordinary large n su(n) gauge theory side
(a product of plaquette variables with no zn -phase factors in the twisted reduced model [1]).
thus noncommutative yang-mills (ncym) theory would be equivalent to the large n ordinary

yang-mills system at least in the high momentum region as argued at the level of feynman
diagram [6, 9].
the paper intends to describe the ultraviolet aspects of noncommutative qed (nc-qed) in
sec. 3 which has not been reported in short article [12] as well as the detail about the compu-
tation of the infrared aspects common to ncym theory in sec. 4 and appendix. to make this
paper self-contained and explain the results more clearly, the other parts of ref.
[12] should
also be described in detail. it is expected to guide and help one to further study the quantum
mechanical aspect of noncommutative eld theory.
thus the paper is organized as follows: sec. 2 is concerned with incorporation of the matter elds
and showing that the allowed choice is quite limited. in sec. 3 nc-qed theory is quantized to
investigate ultraviolet aspect to demonstrate that the one-loop divergence can be subtracted by
the usual set of local counterterms. sec. 4 studies the infrared aspects of the theory through
the anomalous magnetic dipole moment and vacuum polarization of photon. the extension to
the chiral gauge theory is also examined in sec. 5, but it is found that there is no chiral gauge
theory. sec. 6 is devoted to the summary of the present paper.

2 construction of classical action

we begin with pure u(1) ncym system, which has the classical action in space-time dimen-

sion d

here the eld strength f is

sy m = z ddx (cid:18)

4g2(cid:19) f  f  .

f = a   a  i[a, a ]m ,

where [a, b]m denotes moyal bracket:

[a, b]m = a  b  b  a .

the -product

 a(x + ) b(x + )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12),0

is dened in terms of the innite towers of derivative operation with use of an antisymmetric
matrix c  (c  has the dimension of area.) which reects noncommutativity of space-time
by modifying the algebra of functions. even in u(1) case a couples to itself since the eld
strength f has the nonlinear term in a. the -product obeys the associative law which is
also satised by the matrix algebra, thus the algebraic manipulation in -product is the same
as in the calculus of matrix. then, assuming that the elds decrease so promptly at innity that
the space-time integral of a moyal bracket (which corresponds to the trace of the commutator
in the matrix language) vanishes, it is easily shown that the action (1) is invariant under the
gauge transformation

a(x)  a(x) = u (x)  a(x)  u 1(x) + iu (x)  u 1(x) ,

(5)

2

where u (x) = (ei(x)) is dened by an innite series of multiple -product of scalar function
(x). the the similarly dened u 1(x) = (ei(x)) corresponds to the inverse of u (x).
the coupling of electron to gauge eld in u(1) ncym theory receives a severe restriction.
here we mean by electron, the elds which couple to the gauge elds in the similar manner
as in ordinary qed, in which the covariant derivative for the matter eld  with charge q is
given by

d =   iqa .

(6)

conventional assignment of charge q in the electroweak theory is like qe = 1 for electron,
qu = 2
3 for up-type quark, etc. as is well-known there is no reason for q to be quantized in the
electroweak theory. extension to noncommutative case shows that nonzero u(1) charge is not
only quantized, but also limited to be +1 or 1 even on minkowski space-time. this contrasts
with the mechanism of charge quantization on compact manifold from the single-valuedness of
the wave function. we show those facets below.
first a simple algebraic manipulation shows that a combination

which resembles (6), behaves covariantly

d =   ia   ,

d(x)  d

(x) = u (x)  d(x) ,

under transformation (5) for a(x) and

(x)  (x) = u (x)  (x) ,

for (x). likewise if (x) transforms as

(x)  (x) = (x)  u 1(x) ,

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

then the quantity

d  =   + i   a ,

(11)
behaves in the same manner as (10). commutative limit c   0 indicates that  corresponds
to a eld in ordinary u(1) gauge theory with the same magnitude but opposite sign compared
to the one associated with . thus we say that  has charge 1 while  carries +1.
therefore, for instance, the action

smatter = z ddx(cid:0)   id  m   (cid:1) ,

(12)

has local u(1) invariance since  transforms as . however a simple exercise shows that the
simple extension

d(n) = (n)  ina  (n) ,

(13)

with (n)  (n)  = u n(n) for the eld  with integral multiple n of unit charge fails to
transform covariantly.

3

derivation of the above facts and the various formula is similar to that in ordinary non-abelian
gauge theory due to the simple fact that -product satises the associative law. the eld with
charge +1(1) in noncommutative case would correspond to (anti-)fundamental representation
in ordinary nonabelian gauge theory. it is also reminiscent of such features that noncommutative
gauge theory carries the internal degrees of freedom by imbedding them into the space-time
geometry itself. this is the reverse process of the reduction of the space-time degrees of freedom
into the internal ones in the large n gauge theory [14, 1]. when we pursue this correspondence
further, we are inclined to guess that the higher-rank representation of su(n) gauge theory may
convert into some matter elds in noncommutative gauge theory. it would be the counterpart
of the elds with an integral multiple of unit charge from the view point of noncommutative
generalization of u(1) gauge theory. actually the adjoint representation corresponds to a eld
(x) with zero charge in total but transforming in the by-product form

(x)  (x) = u (x)  (x)  u 1(x) .

(14)

its covariant derivative is given by moyal bracket (3). what is the counterpart, for instance, of
the second-rank antisymmetric representation of su(n) gauge theory ? we could not succeed
to nd those other counterparts. although a consequence depends on groping the possibility,
we see that the elds of nonzero charge with dierent absolute magnitude cannot coexist in a
system.
note that the above argument also persists for the static electron. thus the the vacuum ex-
pectation value of wilson loop along the simple rectangular loop is associated with the ground
energy acting between the static sources with charges 1 similarly as in ordinary yang-mills
theory.

3 perturbation theory of noncommutative qed

to perform perturbation theory for nc-qed, we rescale the gauge eld appearing in the previous
section as a  ga. to perform gauge xing to obtain the nonsingular free propagator for the
gauge elds, brst quantization similar to ref. [3] is adequate. incorporating the ghost elds
c, c and the auxiliary elds b, brst transformation

ba = dc = c  ig[a, c]m ,
bc = i g c  c ,
b = ic   ,

bc = ib ,
b  = i   c

bb = 0

(15)

is nilpotent. under this transformation the quantities in (1) and (12) are brst-closed respec-
tively. the faddeev-popov and gauge xing term is introduced as brst-exact form

sgf = z ddx(ib)

2 (cid:18)c (cid:18) 

2

b + a(cid:19) +(cid:18) 

2

b + a(cid:19)  c(cid:19) .

after elimination of b through its equation of motion the above quantity reduces to

sgf = z ddx(cid:18)

2

a  a +

2

(ic  dc  idc  c)(cid:19) .

(16)

(17)

we consider nc-qed on minkowski space-time to estimate the on-shell electron coupling to
the photon. to simplify the discussion -product works eectively on one plane in the space in
the canonical basis of c . this is, we consider the case when c 01 = 0 but nonzero c 23. then
there are two kinds of on shell photon; one with momentum along (2, 3)-plane; one with that
moving orthogonal to (2, 3)-plane. thus we can discuss the eect of explicit lorentz invariance
introduced by c 23.
as in ref. [3] quantization of noncommutative theory is realized as a perturbative expansion by
giving feynman rules through

where the action s is the sum of (1), (12)

z[j] = z d eis[]+ir ddxj(x)(x) ,

sncqed = z ddx (cid:18)

1

4g2 f  f  +   id  m   (cid:19) .

(18)

(19)

together with (17). as a result the propagator is the same as in its commutative counterpart,
while each vertex accompanies with a phase factor shown in fig. 1 depending on the momenta
outgoing from the vertex. it manifests the nonlocal nature of theory.
in order to pursue ultraviolet (uv) divergent structure, we begin with discussing a few typical
vertex functions (contribution to green functions from one particle irreducible feynman dia-
grams with all the external legs amputed) in the succeeding subsections. this would be the
prompt approach to learn about the nature of our theory. the aim of our analysis below is to
demonstrate that at one-loop level the present theory can be made nite by redening the elds
and parameters consistently with the symmetry of the classical action. the analysis also shows
that uv divergence can appear only in a restricted set of diagrams, planar diagram which
will be dened at the end of sec. 3.2.

3.1 two point functions

the electron self-energy receives one-loop correction through only one diagram shown in fig. 2
as in ordinary qed. in this diagram the phase factors accompanied with the two vertices cancel
with each other. thus the contribution is nothing but the one found in ordinary qed. thus
not only uv divergence can be subtracted by the usual rescaling of wave function and mass of
electron, but also the remained nite part does not change as long as the same renormalization
scheme (ms-scheme here) is applied. the wave function renormalization factor z for the
electron is in particular found as

z = 1

corresponds to quadratic uv divergence. however we know that quadratic uv divergence does
not appear in the gauge theory. as will be shown in next section, (21) is cancelled by the singular
terms involved in the contributions from fig. 3(a) and (b). the full expression for these latter

the conclusion of this subsection is that all the ultraviolet divergences can be subtracted away
by the same local counterterms as in ordinary qed.

3.2 electron coupling to photon

on account of nding the correction to magnetic dipole moment in the next section we describe
the detail of one loop correction to the interaction of the electron to photon mainly. there are

figure 3: correction to vacuum polarization of photon

two topologically distinct diagrams which contribute to this interaction. the rst one shown in
fig. 4(a) is the analogue of qed while the other occurs through a nonabelian vertex involving
three gauge bosons as shown in fig. 4(b). the qed-like diagram in fig. 4(a) is nite while
the nonabelian-type diagram in fig. 4(b) leads uv-divergence. the local counterterm with the
coecient

g2

(26)

is sucient to remove this divergence.

here we would like to check whether we identify uv divergence properly, and quantize a
system maintaining local gauge invariance. the nontrivial point to be examined here is the
universality of gauge coupling constant. this implies the relations among the rescale factors z
for each eld , z123 for each coupling to which 1, 2 and 3 participate

(28)

the relation (27) and this fact insist that the eects of incorporation of electron must cancel
between the denominator and the numerator in each of the other three combinations in (27).
before observing this fact we recall the situation in ordinary qed. in ordinary qed the relation
(27) reduces to

= 1 .

(29)

is derived from

that is, z|qed is required to balance completely with z a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)qed

uv-divergence of the similar diagram in fig. 4(a). returning to nc-qed, the argument in
sec. 3.1 showed that z is the same (20) found in ordinary qed, z = z|qed. however
in nc-qed the qed-like diagram in fig. 4(a) does not diverge contrary to the case in qed.
(note that this feature persists for any choice of gauge xing parameter.) those facts raise the
question whether the relation (27) is actually maintained or not. somewhat curiously z a in
eq. (26) obtained from fig. 4(b) and z in (20) establishes eq. (27) with (28). the direct
computation also shows that all the divergences in aaa- and aaaa-vertices can be subtracted

by the usual countertems and the associated z factors satisfy the relations required in eq. (27).
also in the present theory, the  function signies whether the theory is well dened at an
uv xed point or not.
it also helps one to improve the accuracy of the approximation by
resuming the large logarithmic corrections. however we must always keep in mind that the
typical behavior at some xed energy scale cannot be drawn from the usual intuition based on
the block-spin renormalization group method applicable to local eld theory.
the beta function is the simplest to nd by observing the gauge interaction of faddeev-popov
ghosts. there only za derived from the singularity of the photon vacuum polarization receives
the electron eect at one-loop level. eqs. (28) and (25) lead

a contribution 22
3 is due to the structure similar to nonabelian dynamics which is pure su(2)
yang-mills theory [3, 4]. however the matter contribution is that found in qed theory with
unit charge, not that of the quarks belonging to the fundamental representation of su(2) gauge
theory (where 2
the above analysis indicates the following general features about uv divergence. first we write
a diagram according to feynman rule in fig. 1. then the associated contributions are divided
into the pieces each of which has a denite momentum-dependent phase factor. if a given piece
admits a loop momentum which does not appear in any phase factor, it can lead divergence
(it may be a subdivergence which should be subtracted by the counterterms determined at the
previous order of perturbation.) we dene such a diagram as planar diagram. power counting
argument allows us to choose the supercially divergent pieces among those planar diagrams.
since the same mechanism above works in the more complex diagrams appearing in the vertex
functions with three or more external legs, uv divergence can only appear in the vertex functions
corresponding to that in the ordinary qcd (three gauge boson vertices, etc.). determination
of the above fact due to t hooft-type representation may be developed along the same line as
done for ncym theory in ref. [2, 9, 10].

4 some infrared aspects

we are more interested in the infrared aspect under the situation that uv behavior is shown
to be greatly modied due to nonabelian nature of noncommutative eld theory. the small
number of avors insures that the theory is asymptotically free. this behavior suggests the
strong coupling low energy dynamics of the theory. but here we assume that the coupling is
kept small and the theory admits the perturbative analysis. the perturbative infrared aspect is
examined by calculating the leading correction to magnetic dipole moment (g  2) in sec. 4.1
as well as the vacuum polarization of the photon in sec. 4.2, and ask what modication occurs
in the extension to nc-qed.

where x = (q2)(cid:8)(+ + )2m2 + +(q2)(cid:9), and k1(x) is a modied bessel function of the
second kind [15]. at this stage we can justify that q2 and q2 in h(1, p, q) is brought to zero
without confronting with any singularities since k1(x)  1
x for x  0. thus for q2 = 0 and
q2 = 0, h(1, p, q) becomes equal to h(0, p, q). therefore the magnetic dipole moment does not
change for the photon with no transverse momentum along (2, 3)-plane (q = 0). the photon
on mass shell can, of course, have the momentum transverse along such a plane. eq. (31) then
exhibits the dierence where

h(1, p, q)|q2=0 =

with x(s) = (q2)m2s2. we note the two points. the rst is that the third term in eq. (31)
carries the phase which should be accompanied by the elds with a charge opposite to the
electron. the origin of the sign change can be easily understood in terms of the double-line
representation of photon propagation [2, 9, 10]. the second feature is that nonzero q2 enters

in the integrand with a combination x = (q2)(cid:8)(+ + )2m2 + +(q2)(cid:9), or (q2)(q2).

such a feature is also observed in the charge form factor. this indicates that the threshold
behavior around electron-positron pair production q2  4m2 is largely aected by nonzero q2.

4.2 vacuum polarization of photon

the calculation for the nite part of the vertex functions will be necessary to compute the
cross section of, for instance, e+e annihilation process in nc-qed. one important vertex
function is the photon vacuum polarization. indeed the following one-loop calculation of it gives
us the interesting information on the quantum mechanical dynamics of noncommutative eld
theory. here we rst concentrate on the contributions from fig. 3(a)  (c), which also exists in
ncym theory.
we rst remind the appearance of the singular term  1/q2 found in eq. (22) for one feynman
diagram in fig. 3(c). the question is whether it remains even after summing up fig. 3(a) 
(c). the formula (52) derived for the integrals in appendix enables us to extract the singular
terms 1/q2 and ln(q2q2) from eq. (23)

(36)

(37)

which is consistent with slavnov-taylor identity derived from brst symmetry. it should be
recalled that the nonplanar contribution would diverge if the integral in eq. (23) were evaluated
with q2 set equal to zero. the logarithmic infrared singularity ln(q2) in (37) reects the fact
that uv divergence is at most logarithmic. in fact the coecient 10/3 of ln(q2) is that of the
wave function renormalization factor (24) of photon in ncym theory. thus the term singular
in q2 correlates with the ultraviolet divergence. such a phenomenon is also observed in ref.
[6, 10]. the other terms proportional to q q is interesting. the eect of such terms is obscure
until the concrete cross section is estimated.
nc-qed has one extra contribution from fig. 3 (d). it is entirely planar as was discussed in
sec. 4.2. thus the logarithmic infrared singularity in the one-loop correction to photon vacuum
polarization of nc-qed theory is completely the same as in ncym theory at one-loop level.
on the other hand the wave function renormalization of photon receives a net eect from such a
planar contribution and results in eq. (25). thus nc-qed theory does not have the infrared-uv
correspondence as found in ncym theory.

5 weyl fermions and chiral gauge theory

until now all the fermions are assumed to be dirac fermions. it is naturally tempted to pursue
the extension to chiral gauge theory. since the classical analysis given in sec. 2 is irrelevant to
the chiral property of fermion, weyl fermions can have the charge +1 or 1. the right-handed
fermion with +1 charge is easily seen to be replaced by its cp conjugate (the left-handed) fermion
also in the present context. thus the chiral gauge theory simply implies that the number of the
left-handed fermions with +1 charge is not equal to that with 1 1. the question is whether
such a theory circumvents a triangular loop anomaly to dene a consistent quantum theory or
not.
let us imagine one triangular diagram in which the fermion number ows from 1 to 2 with
three incoming external momentum qi (i = 1, 2, 3). then the momentum conservation gives qi
in terms of the internal momenta

q1 = k2  k3,

q2 = k1  k2,

q3 = k2  k3 .

the phase factor associated with the diagram in our mind is

exp(cid:20) i

2

(k3  c  k2 + k2  c  k1 + k1  c  k3)(cid:21) .

(38)

(39)

with help of eq. (38) this phase factor reduces to e i
2 q1c q2. thus a triangular fermion loop
diagram gives only planar contributions. once we remind the correspondence between the
current theory to ordinary nonabelian gauge system in which the external momentum plays the
role of color in the gauge theory side, the remained integral is evaluated in the same manner as
in ordinary nonabelian gauge theory which involves the fundamental and/or anti-fundamental
weyl fermions. from this observation, the number of the left-handed fermions with 1 charge
match with the number of +1 in the system. such a theory is vector-like, i.e., nothing but
nc-qed considered until the previous sections.

6 summary

in this paper nc-qed, which is the simplest extension of u(1) ncym theory, is studied
to observe the uv structure and the perturbative aspects of the low momentum region. it is
observed that one loop diagram are all made nite by the redenition of the operators and
parameters originally involved in a classical action. from the evaluation of those one loop dia-
grams, the uv divergence is suggested to appear only in the planar diagram, which is the same
feature shared already in ncym theory. although ncym theory accommodates su(2)-like
structure in uv divergence, u(1) facet appears in  function when the electron is introduced.
the possibility of the extension to chiral gauge theory is examined, but the simple extension

1 we require that the triangular loop contribution cancels with each other for all momentum conguration.
but it might be too strong requirement for noncommutative su(n) gauge theory due to non-factorizability of
color and phase factors, as suggested by y. kitazawa.

does not admit any chiral gauge theory.
to observe the infrared behavior, the anomalous magnetic dipole moment is evaluated in this
theory. the value is the same as in conventional qed for the photon propagating in the direc-
tion orthogonal to the plane on which noncommutativity enters. in the transverse direction, the
magnetic coupling depends on the magnitude of the components of the momentum along this
direction. this exhibits the violation of full lorentz invariance so(1,3) through the breaking
parameter c 23. it is desirable to know the next-order correction which will pick up the one-loop
modication to the photon propagator. also the explicit evaluation of the cross section of e+e
annihilation process, compton scattering process, etc., should be carried out to capture the
relationship with this explicit violation more directly.
the nite part of the photon vacuum polarization indicates that the singular terms are correlated
with uv divergent structure, which shows up the essential aspects of the quantum mechanical
dynamics of ncym theory not shared by nc-qed theory. the similar analysis for ncym on
the nite volume torus is interesting to further clearly the point, as was done for the analysis of
uv divergence [4, 5]. it is also important to know the special role of of supersymmetry which
can control uv structure in the noncommutative system which is naturally obtained in the con-
text of superstring theory [17]. the above connection of uv and infrared limit invokes us about
the string theory together with the connection of gauge theory to the interacting string theory
[13, 18, 19]. the problem is that the perturbative string theory is absent of uv divergence as
insured by its moduli invariance while the noncommutative theory has uv divergence gener-
ally. then supersymmetry will play the key role. such a subject should be further investigated
similarily to ref.
[10] attempting to construct the string theory which does not refer to any
world-sheet points of view.

here to illustrate the convergence of the various nonplanar portions of diagrams, the ghost
loop contribution in fig. 3(a) to the vacuum polarization of the gauge eld is explicitly evalu-
ated. the application of feynman rule in fig. 1 gives to the associated contribution under the
