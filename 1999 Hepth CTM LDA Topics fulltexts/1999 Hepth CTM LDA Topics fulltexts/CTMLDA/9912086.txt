(cid:20) 1/2 1/2(cid:21), corresponds odd spin structure, anomalous phase), others permuted sl(2, z), one chooses write (cid:20) 0 0(cid:21), (cid:20) 1/2 0 (cid:21). example, dierent choice period, one might use formula constructing theta function sum values a-period n, period integral = 0 half-integral = 1/2. therefore answer question whether given period self-dual one-form integral half-integral depends choice theta function. hand, determines sign factors sum a-periods. conguration given value a-period n weighted sign +1 = 0 sign (1)n (or (1)n+1/2 n half-integral) = 1/2. now, want describe theta functions way generalizes higher genus surfaces also self-dual p-forms p > 1. dene z2-valued function (x) lattice follows.2 lattice points 1 , set (1) = (1)2, ( ) = (1)2.

(3.4) means (x) x a-lattice simply sign factor conguration a-period n = x (or n = x + 1/2) contributes theta function. likewise, saw determines whether a-periods integral half-integral, thus determined (x) x b-lattice. classication theta functions z2-valued functions (x) extends beyond genus one case considered: level one theta functions lattice unimodular antisymmetric form ( , ) metric form positive type (1, 1) classied functions obeying (3.5). fact dierential-geometric explanation reviewed {$9805112$}. (the basic idea determines line bundle ; line bundle constant multiples unique holomorphic section theta function.) present purposes, simply note functions obey (3.5) transform sl(2, z) way theta functions do. assertion, sign factor (1)(x,y) (3.5) essential. example, theta function (cid:20) 1/2 1/2(cid:21) associated odd spin structure sl(2, z)-invariant, must associated function (x) likewise sl(2, z)-invariant. since = = 1/2, theta function (1) = ( ) = 1. sl(2, z) map lattice points 1 1 + , follows (1 + ) must equal 1, get (3.6). 10 write four theta functions explicit formulas (3.3) requires choice a-lattice. information needed, though, choice a-lattice invariant + 1, operation permutes theta functions non-trivial fashion. one also given choice b-lattice (and thus essentially basis (1, ) lattice ), enough information enable writing explicit formulas (3.3). (for that, enough know b-cycles mod 2.) one chosen a-lattice b-lattice, one explicit sl(2, z) transformation 1/ exchanges them. exchanges , thus exchanges half-integral shift value a-period n sign factor dierent values a-period weighted. generalization let us consider generalization self-dual p-form eld gp, p possibly bigger 1, 2p-dimensional manifold .
