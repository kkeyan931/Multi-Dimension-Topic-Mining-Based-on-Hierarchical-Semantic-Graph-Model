abstract

according to a recent conjecture, the moduli space of the heterotic conformal
eld theory on a g  ade singularity of an ale space is equivalent to the
moduli space of a pure n = 4 supersymmetric three-dimensional gauge theory
with gauge group g. we establish this relation using geometric engineering
of heterotic strings and generalize it to theories with non-trivial matter con-
tent. a similar equivalence is found between the moduli of heterotic cft on
isolated calabiyau 3-fold singularities and two-dimensional kazama-suzuki
coset theories.

1. introduction

in a recent paper [1], the exact world-sheet instanton corrected moduli space of the
heterotic conformal eld theory on a g = a1 singularity of k3 has been determined in
the mstr   limit and found to be given by the atiyah-hitchin manifold [2]. this is
the same moduli as that of the three-dimensional pure n = 4 theory [3] with gauge group
g = a1. it has been conjectured in [1] that this relation between the moduli spaces of
the conformal eld theory and the 3d gauge theories holds for any g. for g = an, the
proposal is veried by the analysis of [4].

the three dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theories can be studied by a circle
compactication of the four dimensional n = 2 theories [3]. the instantons in the three
dimensional theory correspond to monopoles and dyons in four dimensions. this situation

can also be studied in the eld theory limit of a type ii compactication on a calabiyau
w times s1. in this theory, the charged states of the eld theory are represented by d-
brane wrappings on small p-cycles cp of a local singularity in w ; in the limit   0 with
v (cp)/()p/2 xed, most of the fundamental states and gravity decouple and one is left
with the light spectrum of the eld theory. e.g., in the type iib theory, the monopole in
four dimensions is a d3 brane wrapped on a small 3-cycle c3 of a singularity in a local
patch of w . the instanton in 3d is the euclidean wrapping of the d3 brane on c3  s1.
the gauge coupling g3 of the three-dimensional eld gets perturbative contributions at
tree level and one-loop as well as possible instanton corrections. the instanton correction is
of the form e(i+i), where  is the scalar dual to the photon and the instanton action i is
approximately 2m r for large r, where m is the mass of the monopole in four dimensions.
in the type ii theory the latter is given by the volume of the brane wrapping v (c3).

the three dimensional gauge theories enjoy often interesting dualities that equate the

coulomb branch of a certain theory with the higgs branch of another [5][6][7]. in the type
ii string, this duality is interpreted as a t-duality on the s1 which takes the type iib on
w  s1(r) to type iia on w  s1(1/r). if w is a singularity of small 3-cycles as in the
previous discussion, the eld theory limit of type iia describes a theory of hypermultiplets
parametrizing the volumes of, and rr elds on, the cycles ci
3. this is the theory that
should be naturally identied with the heterotic cft in the duality discussed in this paper.
the d3 instantons of the type iib theory become euclidean d2 branes wrapped on c3
after the t-duality.

in the heterotic cft, the expansion is in terms of world-sheet instantons and the

corresponding instanton action of the form e

v (c)



, where c is a 2-cycle in the k3 of the

1

heterotic compactication on which a euclidean fundamental string is wrapped. moreover
tree-level and one-loop of the eld theory correspond to the 0 and 1 contribution to
the heterotic string metric, respectively [1]. to obtain the hyper-kahler moduli space of
the eld theory one takes a similar eld theory limit of the heterotic string with   0
at xed v (c)/. the moduli space of hypermultiplets describes the local deformations of
an ade singularity of an ale space that governs the local patch of the k3 in this limit.

although the expansion of the gauge theory and the cft is morally speaking around

the same point, namely in the limit of large instanton action or large volume of the 2-

cycles c in the heterotic string or c in the type iia theory, respectively, it would be

hasty to conclude that the corresponding instanton expansions are exactly the same. in

fact it would be surprising if the wrappings of the d2 brane instantons of the type iia

theory would follow the same rule as that of the fundamental world-sheet instantons of the

heterotic cft. it would be interesting to relate the two instanton expansions.

in this note we derive the conjecture of ref.[1] by using heterotic/type ii duality to show

that the type ii geometry w associated to the heterotic string the ade singularity is the

appropriate, known calabiyau singularity of small 3-cycles that yields the g gauge theory
upon type iib compactication on w  s1. we will also consider various generalizations
of the conjecture.

2. field theory limit

consider the heterotic string compactication on k3  t 2, where the k3 will be
replaced by the ade singularity momentarily. in general this is dual to type iia on a k3
bered calabiyau 3-fold w . if we assume that the bundle factorizes on k3t 2 and the
heterotic k3 is elliptically bered, the four-dimensional duality can be pushed up to six

dimensions, between f-theory on the, now elliptically bered, calabiyau w and heterotic

string on k3.

let us rst show that the the eld theory limit of the heterotic string described by

the cft on the ade singularity with a hyper-kahler moduli space corresponds to a -

special - eld theory limit of the type iia theory the heterotic parameters behave as

ghet  0,



het  0,

v (c)/

het = const.,

(2.1)

where c stand collectively for a 2-cycle in the ade singularity.

2

first note that all p-cycles of k3 except for the cycles c of the singularity grow as
p/2 in the limit (2.1). this holds in particular for the two universal classes e and b of
the elliptically bered k3 with a section, where e is the class of the ber and b the class

of a section. consider the singularity from a collision of singular elliptic bers at a point

s0 of b. the transverse dimensions to the singularity are described by e and b, which
become non-compact in the above limit. therefore we are left with the local singularity of

a non-compact ale space.

the four-dimensional compactication above can be considered as a compactication
of the six-dimensional duality between type iia on k3 and heterotic string on t 4 on a base
p1 denoted by b. from the relations in [8] one can then easily see that the four-dimensional

coupling constants are related by

1

vhet(b)
6,het  vii (b),
g2

1
4,ii 
g2

vii (b)
6,ii  vhet(b).
g2

(2.2)

note that b is the base of the elliptically bered k3 of the heterotic theory and the k3

bration of w in the type iia theory, respectively. since vhet(b) becomes large, we have
a weakly coupled type iia theory. to have a weakly coupled heterotic string, vii (b)
becomes large, too.

moreover the type iia string is obtained from wrapping a heterotic 5-brane on t 2
times the elliptic ber of k3. for generic volume of t 2 this 4-cycle becomes very large
and therefore   0 in the type ii theory. however as we will show in the next section,
the limit we have to take is not the naive   0 limit: to the small 2-cycles ci in k3
correspond small 3-cycles ci in w with a xed volume v (ci)/3/2
ii .

above we have recovered the denition of the eld theory limit of the dual type ii

string studied in the geometric engineering approach of type ii strings [9] on calabi

yau singularities. the fact that it is the ber of the heterotic k3 z that gets large

(and not just the 4-cycle of the 5-brane wrapping) implies a special limit in the complex

structure of the calabiyau singularity. we will show in the next section that the special

singularities one obtains in this way are precisely those used in [10] to extend the geometric

engineering approach of [9] to describe heterotic moduli spaces by f-theory limits of calabi

yau singularities. the subsequent sections may be understood without going through the

mathematics of the next section.

3

3. dual type iia singularities and stable degenerations

a second consequence of the large elliptic ber of z is a limit in the complex structure

of w that is known as a stable degeneration [11][12][13]. in particular it was proposed in
[11] that if w is a k3 manifold, one can see the heterotic t 2 in w on the nose in the limit
of the stable degeneration, which in heterotic terms corresponds to a very large t 2. since
we are interested in the complex structure of w parametrized by the hypermultiplets of

the type iia theory, we can consider f-theory compactication on w dual to heterotic
on z without the extra t 2. the type iia theory is related to f-theory by the extra t 2
compactication which will aect only the kahler moduli space of the calabiyau w .

in the following we will describe in some detail general deformations of the stable

degeneration and make contact with the eld theory limit of the type iia on non-compact

singularities considered in [10]. we will verify the identications made in [11] and add

also the information about the bundles on the heterotic manifold z in this way. this will

serve as a starting point for the identication of the type ii singularity dual to the ade

singularity of the heterotic string in the next section.

the elliptically bered manifold w for f-theory compactication in weierstrass form

is given by

pw = y2 + x3 + xf + g = 0,

(3.1)

with f and g some functions depending on the coordinates on the base b of the elliptic
bration  : w  b. to describe the limit in complex structure we are interested in,
we consider families of the f-theory manifold w in a bration over the complex plane,

similarly as in [13]. let us write (3.1) in more detail as

pw = y2 + x3 + xx

s4s4+f (4)

 +x

s6s6+f (6)
 ,

(3.2)

where f (k)
 are constants if w is a k3, but more generally functions on the n1 dimensional
base b of the k3 bration  : w  b of the calabiyau n + 1-fold w. moreover s and
s are homogeneous coordinates on the base p1 of the elliptic bration of the k3 ber.

to perform the limit, we consider families y of w in a bration over another p1

parametrized by 

py = y2 + x3 + xx,

s4s4+4f (4)

 a(4)

, +x,

s6s6+6f (6)

 a(6)
,,

4

, are some complex constants that we will set to 0 or 1 in the following.

where a(k)
in
general, the ber of y at  = 0 is a (certain deformation) of the original manifold w .
however if we restrict the complex structure of y such that a(k)
, = 0 for  +  > k the
ber at  = 0 becomes

py = y2 + x3 + xs4 x0

ss4+f (4)

 + s6 x0

ss6+f (6)
 ,

which has a non-minimal singularity at y = x = s = 0. after a blow up of y ,

y = 3y, x = 2x, s = s,  = ,

we arrive at

py  = y2 + x3 + xx,

s4s4+44f (4)

 +x,

s6s6+66f (6)
 .

the singular ber at  = 0 is now replaced by a reducible ber w with two components
corresponding to  = 0 and  = 0:

pw1 = p0 + p+ =(y2 + x3 + xf (4)

(xx<0

(xx>0

0 + f (6)
0 )+
 + x<0
0 + f (6)
0 )+
 + x>0

s4+f (4)

s6+f (6)

 ),

(3.3)

pw2 = p0 + p =(y2 + x3 + xf (4)
s4f (4)

s6f (6)

 ).

the two components w1 and w2 intersect over the locus  =  = 0 described by p0 = 0.
according to [11] this intersection is to be identied with the heterotic manifold z.

this proposal can be made precise using local mirror symmetry which allows to also
extract the heterotic bundle [10]. as shown there, a type iia compactication on certain
non-compact calabiyau singularities w results in a gravity free eld theory with the
moduli space of holomorphic stable bundles on a compact calabiyau zn dened as a
certain hypersurface in w. for appropriate structure group of the bundle this data can be
interpreted as a heterotic compactication in the point particle limit. from comparison
with (3.3), one observes that if we consider separately a manifold w1 described by pw1 = 0,
it describes precisely a non-compact calabiyau singularity of the type considered in [10].
the singularity w1 indeed describes the moduli space of holomorphic stable bundles v on
z : p0 = 0. moreover we can use the identications for the singularity w1 derived in [10]
to read o the moduli of the bundle v on z.

5

4. chains and cycles in w

let us show now how the vanishing 2 cycles ci of the heterotic ade singularity
correspond to shrinking 3-cycles in the dual type ii manifold w . the latter support the
d2 instantons of the eld theory limit of the type iia theory and the monopole wrappings

of the t-dual type iib theory that represents the coulomb branch of the three-dimensional
gauge theory.

let us start with the illustrative and simpler case of f-theory on a k3 w dual to
heterotic string on t 2. it shares many of the relevant aspects with the case of the heterotic
string on k3 that will be obtained by bering over an extra p1.

before the stable degeneration, w is an elliptic bration over a p1 with 24 singular
elliptic bers located at the zeros of the discriminant  = 4f 3 + 27g2, where f and g are
degree 8 and 12 polynomials in the variable s on the base p1, respectively. after the stable
degeneration, w has split into the two components w1 and w2 described by eq. (3.3),
intersecting over the elliptic curve e : p0 = 0. the base of the elliptic brations of the
elliptic rational surfaces wi are two p1s that intersect over a point,  =  = 0. there are
12 points on each p1 above which the elliptic bers becomes singular:

fig. 1: the original k3 and the generic stable deformation.

there are two basic degenerations of this elliptic bration. first we can bring together
singular elliptic bers of a single component, say w1. this introduces a singularity of small
2-cycles in w1 with a type determined by the classication of kodaira. since the relative
location of the singular elliptic bers is described by p+ in eq.(3.3), with parameters
that translates to that of the heterotic bundle as described in [10], this corresponds to a
degeneration of the gauge bundle in the heterotic string on t 2.

the second kind of degeneration consists of bringing together a singular ber from
w1 with another singular ber from w2. this is only possible at the intersection of the
two base p1s at  =  = 0. again we obtain a shrinking 2-cycle c in w . however note
that c intersects e along a 1-cycle .

6

to see the cycle c and the fact that its volume vanishes if and only if the 1-cycle 

shrinks, consider the local situation in w1 described by choosing

f = f0 + f1 = (3a2) + f1,

g = g0 + g1 = (2a3  ) + g1,
in (3.1). for small , the heterotic torus at  = 0 has a small s1 described by

(4.1)

 : y2 + x2 = .

away from  = 0 there is still an s1, (), with a radius p() depending on the value
of . from the vanishing of the discriminant  = 0 + 1 we see that () shrinks to
zero size at a point 0 = 0/1. we can therefore dene a two 2-chain k (1) in w1 from
gluing together 1-cycles () along the interval  = [0, 0].

e:

fig. 2: the 2-chain k (1) in w1.

note that the cycle  = (0) in e shrinks i 0 = 0, which implies 0  0. thus
precisely if  shrinks, k (1) shrinks, too. in fact the volume of the 2-chain k (1) is determined
by the integral

where the proportionality constant depends on the normalization of the 2-form . in the
total manifold w we obtain a vanishing 2-cycle from the two vanishing 2 chains k ()  w
joining along the vanishing cycle . note that we can write the discriminant of w as
( w ) = (w1)  (w2), which vanishes to second order at  =  = 0 due to the rst
order vanishing of (wi).

thus this second kind of degeneration is related to a geometric degeneration of the
heterotic torus e. this does not make too much sense in the case of the torus, since its
degenerations are very limited and in fact at innite distance in the moduli space1. we can
also combine the two kind of degenerations and bring together several singular bers from

1 however note that in this limit we have u =  = t so we can interpreted the su (2)
gauge symmetry of the type iia string on the vanishing 2-cycle as the heterotic gauge symmetry

enhancement at t = u in the limit t  .

7

w1 and w2 at the intersection. from the above this should correspond to a degeneration
of the bundle on top of the singular heterotic geometry.

having discussed this toy example, let us consider the case of heterotic string on a
non-trivial calabiyau zn, n > 1, in particular for z = k3. the new ingredient is that
we can now have geometric singularities of z at nite distance in the moduli, in particular

ade singularities of ale spaces. let us ber the eight-dimensional picture in fig. 1 over
an extra p1, parametrized by t. the local structure of the 3-fold geometry w for small
2-cycles ci in z is similar as in eq.(4.1) with an extra dependence on the base p1:

f = f0(t) +  f1(t),

g = g0(t) +  g1(t).

(4.3)

similarly we can split the discriminant of the elliptic bration as  = 0(t) +  1(t).
near a g singularity of the k3, the zeros of 0 are described by

0 =



yi

(t  ti(ak)) = t + . . . ,

(4.4)

where ak, k = 1, . . . , rk g denote the deformations of the singularity and  is a certain
integer that counts the number of simple singular bers needed to produce the g singularity
in the elliptic bration2. classically, the g singularity is recovered in the limit, where the
perturbations ak become zero.

moving away from  = 0 to describe the 3-fold w , the zeros ti of the discriminant 

depend on :

 = 0 +  1 =



yi

(t  ti(ak, )).

(4.5)

note that for each pair of ti(ak, ), we can dene a 2-cycle cij() by stringing together 1-
cycles in e along the interval [ti(ak, ), tj(ak, )], very similar as we did in the construction
of the 2-chains k (). moreover the 2-cycle cij() attaches to a 2-cycle cij of the k3 z for
 = 0. in addition it shrinks to zero size at a point  = ij where

ti(ak, ij) = tj(ak, ij).

(4.6)

very similar as in the previous case we can now build 3-chains k ()
2-spheres cij() along the interval [0, ij].

ij by gluing together the

2 e.g.  = n for su (n ) and more generally  = rkg+ 1+ , where  is the number of trivalent

vertices in the dynkin diagram of g. see ref.[14].

8

finally note that for very similar reasons as for the 2-chains constructed before, the
ij vanishes precisely if the 2-cycle cij shrinks and in particular

volume of the 3-chain k ()
all 3-chains shrink near the singularity of the heterotic k3 z

ak  0  ij  0.

(4.7)

one can calculate also the volume of the individual 3-chains k ()
ij

similarly as in (4.2).

we have therefore succeeded to establish a 1-1 correspondence between the small
2-cycles cij of the resolved ade singularity and small 3-cycles cij = k (1)
ij of a
singularity reached in the complex structure of the type ii compactication manifold w .
the lattice h3( w ) inherits the ade structure from the lattice h2(z). note that the
cycles cij intersect each other according to the ade dynkin diagram. this ts with the
physics expectations that the instanton corrections to the three-dimensional gauge theory
represented by type iib on w arise from the monopoles and dyons, as opposed to the
wrappings of purely electric cycles.

ij  k (2)

the singularity of the type ii manifold w is precisely the one which is known to
produce the g gauge theory in three dimensions in a type iib compactication on w  s1
[9]. note that we needed the extra s1 to translate from the heterotic type iia dual that
describes the higgs branch of hypermultiplets, to the coulomb branch of the g gauge
theory of the type iib eld theory limit, which corresponds to the dual theory in the sense
of [5],[6]. let us also identify the states dual to the monopoles from d3 branes wrapped
on cij. in the t-dual type iia theory they become d4 branes wrapped on cij  s1. in
the heterotic theory they become 5-branes wrapped on cij  t 3.

let us consider now possible generalizations of the above picture by moving additional
singular elliptic bers into the heterotic singularity. as discussed in the eight-dimensional
picture, if we let collide bers at some point  =  of the base of the elliptic surface wi,
this corresponds to a degeneration of the heterotic bundle. moving this point into the
ade singularity,   0, we expect that in general the gauge bundle is not trivial on the
singularity. this would correspond to theories with non-perturbative heterotic dynamics,
such as the extra gauge symmetry enhancement discussed in [10].

let us rst consider a simpler case, where it is easier to nd the answer. in the six-
dimensional compactication we can also consider moving in additional singular elliptic
bers into the singularity using the t direction. in this way we can keep the singularity
of the elliptic surface wi, and thus the bundle, xed on the singularity. in particular, if
we choose a totally trivial gauge bundle there are 24 small instantons located at points
t = ti of the base of z. the case where some of these positions coincide with the location

9

of the ade singularity has been studied in great detail in [15][13]. with some eort one
can show that after moving in such points there are new 3-cycles in w that correspond
to adding matter in the gauge theory following the rules of geometric engineering of type

ii strings. note that we can only get matter that can be obtained from adjoint breaking

of a higher rank gauge group [16] in this way. we will take a shortcut here that uses the

results on three-dimensional mirror symmetry described in [6][7], which will lead us also

to a natural conjecture for new three-dimensional dualities. specically, ref.[7] established

a series of three-dimensional dualities using geometric engineering of type ii on geometric

singularities, which is precisely the situation that we consider. it was shown that if the
type iib theory on a calabiyau w describes a u (n ) theory with nf = k fundamentals,
than the type iia theory on the same manifold describes the higgs branch of a dual theory
with gauge group u (1)  u (2)    u (n  1)  u (n )k2n+1  u (n  1)    u (2)  u (1). on
the other hand [15][13] this is precisely the gauge theory of k small instantons on a su (n )

singularity of k3! thus we see that by considering the eld theory limit of the heterotic

theory with small instantons on the k3 singularity it essentially follows from the results
in [7] that the heterotic moduli of the an 1 singularity with k instantons is the same as
that of the three-dimensional su (n ) theory with nf = k.3

it is natural to wonder whether this relation is true more generally, also in those

cases, where three-dimensional dualities have not yet been established or even formulated.

the prediction would be that the theory dual to the three-dimensional gauge theory with
gauge group g and k matter multiplets is the gauge theory with gauge group g, where g
is the extra local gauge group that appears if k small heterotic instantons collide with a g

singularity of k3.

let us now come back to the case where we move singular bers of the elliptic surface
w1 into the ade singularity. we have in the moment no good understanding of what the
three-dimensional theories associated to such a degeneration may be, however there is also

a plausible candidate for this case from the geometric engineering of type ii strings. note
rst that if we take the base to be p1  p1, we can interpret any of the two p1s as the
base of the heterotic k3. accordingly we have two heterotic theories that are related by

3 it is worth noticing that this result is consistent with a proposal for mirror symmetry of
f-theory formulated in [17] and derived and rened in [10]. in particular it states that if f-theory
on a 3-fold w describes the coulomb branch of k small heterotic instantons on a g singularity
of k3, than the mirror w  is dual to a heterotic theory on the higgs branch describing a large g
instanton with instanton number k. after a t 3 compactication, the two theories are related by
the three-dimensional duality as above.

10

heterotic-heterotic duality [18]. an extension of this duality for singular k3s and bundle

singularities exists and has been described in [10]. in the previous case we have considered
having a g singularity in the k3 with base p1 parametrized by t. of course nothing
changes if we consider instead only a singularity g in the heterotic theory with base the
other p1(s, s). if we now consider a manifold where the g and g singularities collide, we
have in some sense a collision of two gauge theories with groups g and g. this reminds
very much of the structure of the conformal eld theories engineered from type ii strings

in [19]. in this case one has a gauge group g = q su (k ni), with ni the dynkin indices

of a gauge group g and bi-fundamentals in each group factors connected by a link in the
dynkin diagram. the coupling constants of the gauge theory are in fact related to the
coulomb parameter of a g gauge theory which is however broken to a trivial u (1)rk g
factor in the region where we observe the g gauge theory. however it is also possible to
to move towards the origin of the coulomb branch of g and g at the same time. one
obtains in this limit an exotic gravity free theory with string like degrees of freedom [19].
the compactication of this theory on s1 seems to be a good candidate for the three-
dimensional theories related to a collision of a singularity in w1 with an ade singularity
in z.

5. heterotic cft on calabiyau 3-fold singularities and kazama-suzuki mod-

els in two dimensions

by the same arguments as in the previous section we can construct more generally a

correspondence between m + 1-chains in the stable degeneration of a calabi-yau m + 1-
fold wm+1 and m cycles in the intersection of its two components which is an elliptic
m-dimensional calabiyau manifold. for the case m = 3 we obtain a correspondence

between the heterotic cft on the isolated singularity

y2 + h(x, s, t) = 0,

(5.1)

and type ii strings on a calabiyau 4-fold with a corresponding singularity of one dimen-
sion higher described locally by a similar equation with h replaced by h +w2. here h = 0
describes the ade surface singularities

h = sn + t2 + x2
an1,
h = sn + st2 + x2 dn+1,
h = s3 + t4 + x2

e6,

h = s3 + st3 + x2 e7,
h = s3 + t5 + x2
e8.

(5.2)

11

the eld theory limit of type iia theory on these singularities has been identied in [20] as

a kazama-suzuki model based on a coset that depends on the choice of a rr background

on 4-cycles. the rr elds of type iia map to gauge elds of the hetrotic string. we

conclude that the heterotic cft on the 3-fold singularity with appropriate gauge eld

background is on the same moduli as the corresponding kazama-suzuki model. a simple

consistency check on this equivalence is the following one. using linear sigma models it

was argued in [1] that the heterotic cft should be smooth on a singular calabiyau

n-fold for any n as long as the gauge elds are trivial on the singularity. for trivial rr-

elds one obtains a massive kazama-suzuki model with no light degrees of freedom. this

matches the non-singular behavior of the heterotic theory advocated in [1]. it would be

interesting to compare in detail the moduli spaces for the more interesting case with non-

trivial background elds, in particular when the heterotic string is compactied on the

(2, 2) theory.

6. discussion

the equivalence of the moduli space of the heterotic cft on ade singularities and the

moduli space of three dimensional gauge theories, or the dual monopole moduli spaces,

is an interesting tool to study several aspects. e.g., the metric of the atiyah-hitchin

manifold is known [2] and one can extract the world-sheet instanton expansion of the

heterotic cft, similarly as one obtains the world-sheet instantons of the type ii string

from mirror symmetry. by an appropriate reparametrization, we expect to reproduce the
d2 instanton expansion of the type iia string on w . this allows to analyze a new class of
brane wrappings. it is interesting to note in this context that it is easy to verify that the

atiyah-hitchin metric is compatible with the claim in [3] that in the gauge theory variables

there is only a single instanton contribution; this is a rst non-trivial compatibility check.

reversing the logic it would also be very interesting to study metrics on monopole moduli

spaces from the cft approach. similarly it would be interesting to study the relation

between instanton corrections to the metric of the heterotic 3-fold and the two-dimensional

kazama-suzuki models.

note added: while preparing this note for publication, two related papers appeared on

the subject. ref.[21] gives an independent derivation of the conjecture of ref.[1] using m-
theory. ref.[22] treats the special case g = a1 case, already analyzed in [1], using a new
variant of geometric engineering for heterotic strings. in fact this is the same geometric

12

engineering used in this paper4 and derived and studied in detail by local mirror symmetry
in [10][19][23].

in particular the denition of the geometric limit on p.6 in [22] is a special example of the

analysis in app. a of [10].
