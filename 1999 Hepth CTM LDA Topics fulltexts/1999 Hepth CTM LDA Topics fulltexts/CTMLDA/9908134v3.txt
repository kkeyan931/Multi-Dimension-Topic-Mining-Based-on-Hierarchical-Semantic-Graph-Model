abstract

using the correspondence between gauge theories and string theory in curved back-

grounds, we investigate aspects of the large n limit of non-commutative gauge theories by

considering gravity solutions with b elds. we argue that the total number of physical de-

grees of freedom at any given scale coincides with the commutative case. we then compute

a two-point correlation function involving momentum components in the directions of the

b-eld. in the uv regime, we nd that the two-point function decays exponentially with

the momentum. a calculation of wilson lines suggests that strings cannot be localized

near the boundary. we also nd string congurations that are localized in a nite region

of the radial direction. these are worldsheet instantons.

1. introduction

gauge theories on non-commutative spaces can arise in certain limits of string theory

[1,2,3,4]. specically, one considers a system of dp-branes with a constant ns b along

their worldvolume directions. in general, there are open strings and closed strings coupled

together, but it is possible to take a low energy limit rescaling some parameters of the

theory, like the metric along the worldvolume directions and the string coupling constant

in such a way that the closed strings decouple and the resulting action for the open string

modes is the one corresponding to a non-commutative gauge theory [1,4].

in this paper we consider gravity solutions that are related to dp branes with b elds.

in the spirit of [5,6], the near horizon region of these gravity solutions should describe the

large n limit of non-commutative gauge theories. we will see that the limit we have to

take in order to isolate the near horizon region is the same as the limit that is taken

from the eld theory point of view. these gravity solutions reduce to the usual dp brane

solutions very close to the horizon; this corresponds to the fact that the eld theory reduces

to the commutative eld theory at long distances. in all cases the dilaton goes to zero

at the boundary faster than in the commutative counterparts. close to the boundary

the solution is quite dierent from the usual dp brane solution and it typically contain a

varying h = db ns eld as well as some rr eld strengths. the presence of a b eld
induces a d(p 2) charge density. in fact, we can gauge away b in the bulk at the expense
of introducing a u (1) eld strength on the brane theory. so some of the gravity solutions

are essentially the ones found in [7,8].

our discussion will mostly concentrate on solutions describing d3 branes with b

elds. we will see that correlation functions between operators with vanishing momentum

along the directions with non-zero b eld give the same correlation functions as in the

case with zero b-eld. this is in agreement with the arguments in [9], which indicate that

planar diagrams depend on the non-commutativity parameter only through the external

momenta. correlators with dependence on the momenta along the b directions are quite

dierent. in particular, we nd that the equation for small uctuations of a certain graviton

mode is formally the same as the wave equation in the full d3-brane geometry. the

renormalization factors necessary to dene the correlators depend on the momenta. this

renders two-point functions rather ambiguous, since one can substract any function of the

external momenta. (the ratio of three point functions to two point functions should be

unambiguous). we discuss a prescription to dene correlation functions, and calculate the

1

two-point function corresponding to the components of energy-momentum tensor of the
gauge theory. we choose our prescription so that at low energies the correlator reproduces
the usual k4 log k2 behavior of the standard commutative gauge theory. at high energies,
we nd an exponential fall o with the momentum.

by the holographic principle, one can determine the number of degrees of freedom by
computing the area of surfaces at xed r, and relating them to the number of degrees of

freedom of the eld theory with an energy cuto of order r. the number of degrees of
freedom, computed in this fashion, is the same as in the commutative case, though there

seems to be redistribution of them, in a sense that will be explained.

the supergravity solution in minkowski space with a b eld in the time direction is

also given. this corresponds to a d3 brane with electric and magnetic u(1) worldvolume
elds. other generalizations are discussed in section 6. we give gravity solutions corre-
sponding to m5 branes in the presence of a constant c eld  a theory whose dlcq
version was studied in [10]  and we construct solutions for d1-d5 systems with b elds.

these include a solution where the b eld is along the worldvolume of the d1 brane, and
the case where the b eld is on a torus inside the 5-brane world volume.

while this paper was being written we received the paper [11] which has some overlap

with section 2.

2. construction of the solutions

2.1. d3 brane in constant b eld

in this section we obtain the solution of a d3 brane in a constant ns b eld back-
ground. all solutions with non vanishing b elds in this section preserve 16 supersym-
metries. first we consider the case where there is only one component b23 dierent from
zero. a simple way to obtain the solution is to perform a t-duality along x3. this gives
a smeared d2 brane on a tilted torus. it is easy to write down this solution. then we
t-dualize back on x3, using the t-duality rules for rr backgrounds derived in [12]. the
solution in string metric is

the asymptotic value of the b eld is b

23 = tan . the parameter r is dened by

cos  r4 = 4gn ,

(2.2)

where n is the number of d3 branes, and g  g is the asymptotic value of the coupling
constant.
it is possible to gauge away a constant b-eld. however, this introduces a
constant ux for the worldvolume gauge eld, since under b  b + d, a  a  . in
fact, performing this gauge transformation we obtain a solution which is the same as (2.1)
except that the value of the b eld is shifted by b  b  b. in that form, it is easy to
see that the solution has d3 and d1 brane charges. this solution was found in [7,8], and

it represents d1 branes dissolved in d3 branes.

in euclidean space, one can also construct a solution with b01 = tan , b23 = tan 

in a similar way. the solution in string metric is given by

ds2

str = f 1/2[h(dx2

0 + dx2

the parameter r is given by r4 = 4gn (cos  cos )1.

there is an analogous solution with lorentzian signature which is obtained by a wick
rotation x0  ix0 and   i (so that cos   cosh , sin   i sinh ). as a result,
the imaginary factors in the gauge elds disappear. the lorentzian solution can also

be obtained from eleven dimensions by starting with a stack of m2-branes (with world-

volume coordinates x0, x1, x2 ) smeared in two direcions x3, x4. one redenes coordinates

(2.3)

as follows:

x4 = x4 cos  + (x2 cos  + x3 sin ) sin  ,
x2 = x4 sin  + (x2 cos  + x3 sin ) cos  ,
x3 = x2 sin  + x3 cos  .

next, we make dimensional reduction in x4 and a t-duality transformation in the x3-

direction. we nd

the function h is the harmonic function appearing in the original m2 brane metric. the

solution is indeed the wick rotated version of (2.3), with the identication of parameters:
0 = r4 cosh2 , cos2  = 1/ cosh2 . the particular case  = 0 appeared in [13]. in this
r4
case the background (2.5) reduces to the solution which is obtained by applying s-duality

transformation to the solution (2.1).

2.2. decoupling limit

the above solutions are asymptotic to at space for r   and they have a horizon
at r = 0. very near r = 0 the solutions look like ads5  s5. the throat region connecting
if we take the standard low energy
these two contains non-zero ns and rr b elds.

limit, keeping all other parameters constant we just get the usual ads solution. on the
boundary we have the usual n = 4 yang-mills theory. in order to obtain non-commutative
yang-mills we should also take the b eld to innity. the supergravity solution itself tells

us what limit we should take to decouple the asymptotic region while still keeping the

region of the spacetime where b elds vary.

for the solution (2.1) the rescaling of the parameters should be the following

tan  =

  0 ,
x0,1 = x0,1 ,

b

x2,3 =

x2,3 ,

(2.6)

r = r2u ,

g =

g ,

where b, u, g, x stay xed. this scaling of parameters is precisely the same as the scaling
that was found in [4]. the factor of b in the second line of (2.6) is introduced just for later
convenience.

where g is the value of the string coupling in the ir. now we have r4 = 4gn . notice

the b and a elds are dened with respect to the new coordinates and they include some

rescalings implied by (2.6). we propose that (2.7) is the dual gravity description of non-
commutative yang-mills. this solution reduces to the ads5s5 solution for small u, which
corresponds to the ir regime of the gauge theory. this is consistent with the expectation

that non-commutative yang-mills reduces to ordinary yang-mills theory at long distances.

the parameter a has the dimension of length, and the solution starts deviating from the

ads5  s5 solution at u  1/a, i.e. at a distance scale of the order a = rpb. for large
gn  r4, this is greater than the naively expected1 distance scale of l  pb. this can be

interpreted as due to strong interactions, which seem to render visible the eects of non-

commutativity at longer distances than naively expected. the solution has a boundary
at u = . as we approach the boundary, the physical size of the 2, 3 direction shrinks
(in string units), since h  1/u4 for large u. all curvature invariants in string metric
remain bounded as we approach the boundary. the reason for this is that the string
metric near the boundary has a scaling isometry: x0,1  1x0,1, u  u, x2,3  x2,3.
consequently, curvature invariants of the metric near u =  (obtained by h  1/(au)4 )
cannot depend on u, for u  . however, if we were to compactify the 2, 3 directions we
would get a singularity since some winding modes would become light. this singularity

cannot be avoided by going to the t-dual description. in fact, t-duality transformations
along x2, x3 lead to the same background (2.1) with the exchange cos   sin . in the case
that the b eld is rational the singularity can be removed by performing an appropriate

1 from the limiting form of the two point function of the coordinate of the boundary of an

open string we nd that [x2, x3] 

b [1,4] .

5

sl(2, z) t-duality transformation, as explained in [1]. these decoupled solutions still

have 16 supersymmetries, there is no supersymmetry enhancement since the theory is not

conformal.

the near-horizon background (2.7) can also be obtained from eleven dimensions by

starting from the standard m2 brane solution smeared in two directions x3, x4, making
dimensional reduction in a null circle x+ = x4 + x0, and t-duality in x3. this is related to

the observation of [1] that m theory compactied on a null circle with non-zero c+ij leads

to non-commutative geometry. thus the solution (2.7) has also the eleven-dimensional

interpretation of an m2 brane with an innite boost in a transverse direction.

let us now consider the decoupling limit of the geometry (2.3). the rescaling of the

parameters is basically the same as (2.6) except that now one should also rescale the 0, 1

coordinates and the string coupling in a slightly dierent way,

g =

we introduce parameters a, a with dimension of length by a2 = br2, a2 = br2. we get

where again g is the value of the string coupling in the ir. this solution reduces to the
standard ads5  s5 solution for small u. the eects of non-commutativity appear at the
largest of the two scales a = rpb or a = rpb. for large u the physical size of the
spatial directions decreases, but all curvature invariants in string metric are bounded. in
fact, the string metric for large u is again ads5  s5. although the point u =  may
look like the horizon of ads, the other elds are dierent from the elds of the usual
ads5  s5 solution. in particular, the dilaton e goes to zero at large u. this implies

6

that uctuations close to the boundary are suppressed (that is why we call it boundary).

this boundary is similar in spirit to the case of the ns vebrane. there also we nd that

the metric in string units remains constant as we move away from the horizon. for the

ns vebrane the dilaton goes to zero and this suppresses interactions as we approach the

boundary. the fact that the dilaton goes to zero also freezes the asymptotic geometry,

which is the physical property that we expect from a boundary. a completely analogous

situation arises in the near horizon geometry of d-instantons. there again the dilaton

goes to zero and the physical size in string metric goes to zero. in fact, the d-instanton

boundary looks like the origin of r10 except that the string coupling is going to zero. this

similarity is not a coincidence, in fact the behavior of the solution (2.9) close to u   is
the same as the behavior of a d-instanton smeared in the 0123 directions. if we compute

the area in planck units of a surface of constant u we see that it increases as u4. this is

the same behavior that one nds in the pure commutative yang-mills.

the decoupling limit for the metric (2.3) with lorentzian signature has a dierent

form, since the limit must be taken in a dierent way. as it is clear from the eleven-

dimensional origin as a stack of rotated m2 branes (2.5), the appropriate limit now amounts

to dropping the 1 in the harmonic function h. the string coupling e becomes strong

at large u. remember that we nd the lorentzian signature version of (2.3) by replacing

  i. the scaling of parameters is as follows:

3. generalization to non-extremal metrics

a b-eld can be similarly introduced in the non-extremal d3 brane background by

the same u-duality transformations that were made above for the extremal case. the

(3.1)

string theory on this non-extremal background should provide a dual description of non-

commutative yang-mills theory at nite temperature.

an interesting question concerns the number of degrees of freedom of non-commutative

gauge theories. because of the non-commutative nature of the space-time coordinates, one

may expect that in the ultraviolet regime there could be a reduction of the degrees of

freedom relative to the usual gauge theories. the number of gauge-invariant degrees of

freedom is reected on the dependence of the free energy with the temperature. let us

denote by s0, e0 and f0 the entropy, energy and free energy of the black d3-brane with

b23 = 0 (a = 0). the hawking temperature of the metric (3.1) is clearly the same as

8

the temperature of the a = 0 metric, since the u, x0 part of the metric is only modied

by a conformal factor. the entropy s for the metric (3.1) is determined by the area of
the event horizon times the volume of the d3-brane, that is, s = v8
v 0
volume of the (x1, x2, x3, 5) space, and v 0
a = 0. from eq. (3.1), it follows that v8 = v 0

8 the corresponding volume for the metric with
8 , and therefore s = s0. by the rst law
of thermodynamics, de = th ds, one can anticipate that the energy is also unchanged.

s0, where v8 is the

8

in fact, it is easy to see that this is the case by calculating the mass directly. thus
f = e  ths = f0. the fact that all thermodynamic quantities are the same as in
ordinary gauge theories is indicating that the number of degrees of freedom is also the

same. the same conclusion applies for the other solutions discussed in this paper. this is

consistent with the arguments of [9], saying that all large n computations with no external

lines should give the same result, which is what we nd.

although the total number of degrees of freedom remains unchanged relative to the

usual case as the energy scale is varied, there seems to be a redistribution of them. as
u  , a contraction of the volume of the torus x2, x3 is compensated by an expansion
of the volume of the sphere. this means that momentum modes become heavier while

angular modes become lighter.

3.2. non-commutative models with n = 0 supersymmetries

let us now consider the system (2.9) with b01 and b23 in the particular case a = a.

the generalization to the non-extremal case is easy if one starts with the usual non-

extremal m2 brane metric, and make dimensional reduction and t-duality as described in

(2.4), and nally the wick rotation to euclidean signature. we then take the decoupling
limit as before.2 the near-horizon, non-extremal metric in the einstein frame is given by

e =  r2a2

2 as explained above, the decoupling limit on the euclidean solution is not equivalent to the

decoupling limit of the lorentzian solution (2.11).

9

(we have rescaled xi  a2xi, i = 0, ..., 3). remarkably, the metric (3.2) coincides with the
euclidean metric of the black d3 brane. the full background is of course not equivalent,

since other elds are also varying and we have written the dilaton as an example. the

identication of parameters with the standard non-extremal solution of [14] is as follows:
a = 1/r, u4
r4 = u4 + r4

h = r4

the d3 brane charge of the usual [14] black d3 brane solution is related to r by r2
 =
4gn 2. in the present case, the charge n (which is in r4 = 4gn ) is not related to
r+, r; now r = 1/a and r+ is a function of a and the radius 0. string theory on
the background (3.2) should be related to the euclidean non-commutative su (n ) gauge

theory with b01 = b23 compactied, with antiperiodic boundary conditions, on the circle
parametrized by x0.

0  1/a4. there is a minimum radius 2

the usual black d3 brane metric [14] has rather non-trivial thermodynamic prop-
erties,3 and one can expect that this will translate into some interesting eect in the
gauge theory dual to (3.2). the parameter uh is given in terms of 0 and a by (3.3), i.e.
min = 1/(2a2), below which
h = 22
u2
we cannot nd smooth solutions of this kind (in terms of the original coordinates xi with
dimension of length, obtained by xi  xi/a2, one has min = a/2). for every 0 such
that 0  min , there are two possible values of uh. the one which is connected to the
ads5 solution is that of smaller uh. the branch with greater uh is unstable. the reason is
that it is essentially the same as a non-extremal schwarzschild black hole in 7 dimensions.

0 = 2

the antiperiodic boundary condition gives rise to tree-level masses of o(1/0) for all
in the present case, the

fermions and supersymmetry is completely broken to n = 0.
radius cannot be taken to zero, since as explained above the metric cannot be smooth at
u = uh for any 0 < min. it is worth noting that the spectrum of the laplace operator
corresponding to the einstein-frame metric (3.2) is continuous. the reason is that there are

plane waves at innity, where the metric is at. this suggests that the mass spectrum of

physical uctuations is continuous (modulo possible subtleties about boundary conditions

due to the varying dilaton and other elds). clearly, more investigation on this model is

needed.

3 at a certain temperature tcr (corresponding to r4

 = 3 or m/mext = 7/23) the
specic heat becomes innity, and above that temperature it becomes negative, whereas, for the
solution with f 

4 , the specic heat is constant and positive.

4. correlation functions

let us rst consider correlation functions in the case that only b23 6= 0. if we consider
elds that do not depend on x2,3 then we can easily see that their correlators give the same
result as in ads5  s5 in the same situation, i.e. zero momentum in the 2,3 directions.
the reason is that we obtained the solution by a u-duality transformation that involved

the 2, 3 directions. since this is a continous symmetry of the gravity solution regardless

of whether the coordinates are compact or not any given boundary conditions for the
elds can be translated into boundary conditions in ads5  s5; one can then calculate
the perturbed supergravity solution, which by asumption will not depend on x2, x3, and

t-dualize it back to obtain the correlation functions.

non-trivial correlations will involve situations where the elds depend on x2, x3. now

both b23 and b01 can be nonzero. general uctuations of the near-horizon background

(2.7) or (2.9) will be coupled in a complicated system of dierential equations. a simple

equation is obeyed by the graviton uctuation h01. this is associated to the energy-

momentum tensor component t01 of the yang-mills theory. let us set all other uctuations
to zero and dene  = g00h01. one can check that all equations of motion are satised

provided

ge2g = 0 ,

e2
g

0 = 1 = 0 ,

(4.1)

where g is the string-frame metric (2.7) or (2.9). that is, the equations of motion

are satised for uctuations which are independent of x0, x1 and obey the scalar laplace

equation. in principle one could consider a situation where the elds depend also on x0, x1

but the equations might be more complicated. we will thus consider the gauge theory
correlator ho(k)o(k)i, where o(k) is the fourier transform of t01(x).

correlation functions in the gauge theory are obtained by the usual prescription [15,16]

h exp(cid:20)z d4k 0(k)o(k)(cid:21) i = exp(cid:2)ssugra(cid:2)(k, u)(cid:3)(cid:3) ,

i = 0, 1, 2, 3,

(4.2)

where (k, u) is the unique solution with (k, u)  0(k) at some boundary at u = . we
work in momentum space because operators in the eld theory are dened most naturally

in momentum space. the equation of motion for  in the background (2.7) then becomes

1

u5 uu5u  k2(cid:18) 1

u4 + a4(cid:19) = 0 ,

11

k  |k| = qk2

2 + k2

3 .

(4.3)

for u = 0, this reduces to the laplace equation in the ads5s5 background. if k2 6= 0, the
behavior of the solutions at large u is dierent: in the ads5 case, one has (u)  au4 +b,
whereas in the case (4.3) the solution behaves asymptotically as (u)  u5/2eka2u.

interestingly, equation (4.3) is the same as the equation for a dilaton uctuation in
the extremal d3 brane metric, with the replacement k2  2r4, and a = 1/r. this
indeed, by the
dierential equation was solved in [17] in terms of mathieu functions.

following change of variable,

u2 =

1
a2 e2z ,

(z) = e2z(z) ,

the equation (4.3) becomes

(cid:18) 2
z2  2k2a2 cosh(2z)  4(cid:19)(z) = 0 ,

which is the mathieu dierential equation with z  iz.

near z =  (or u  0), the solution which is well-behaved is of the form

(z) = e2zk2(kez)  0 for z   .

for z   (or u  ), the solution behaves as

(z) = d(k) a5/2e5z/2(cid:18) exp(cid:2)kaez(cid:3) + b(k) exp(cid:2)  kaez(cid:3)(cid:19) .

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

where d(k) is a constant that must be determined by boundary conditions. the case
analyzed in [17] can be obtained by taking z  z + i/2; this implies that the coecient
b in our case is the same as the reection coecient in their situation. the correlation

functions must be renormalized. the most reasonable way to do this is to impose the

boundary condition

(k, ) =

1

(ka2)5/2 eka20(k) ,

   ,

(4.8)

where u =  is the cuto surface where we impose the boundary conditions. the de-

pendence on  of this boundary condition can be understood as follows. we would like

to renormalize the theory in such a way that the solution at nite u remains xed as
  . the  dependence of (4.8) ensures that. the factor of k is ultimately introduced
to reproduce the correct ir behaviour. one can qualitatively understand it as follows.

12

the boundary condition on  in the ads case is that  goes to a momentum independent

constant on the boundary of ads. in the large u region of the equation (4.3) the solution

has the form   u2(cid:2)a(k)i2(ka2u) + b(k)k2(ka2u)(cid:3); the exponentially increasing term of

(4.7) is in the i2 bessel function. we can see that the boundary condition (4.8) implies
that this function goes to a constant at the origin (plus a term going like 1/u4 ).

from eq. (4.8) we obtain

d 

1

(ka2)5/2(1 + be2ka2)

.

(4.9)

we evaluate the action integrating by parts and using (4.6), (4.7). we nd a boundary

term

s =

=

1

1

2 z d2k(k, u)u5u(u, k)|u=
2 z d2k

1

k5 (cid:2)div(, k, a)  2ka2b(k) +   (cid:3) 0(k)0(k)

(4.10)

where div(, k, a) indicates terms that are divergent when    and which are sub-
stracted away. the dots indicate terms that vanish when   . so we nd that the
correlation function is proportional to the coecient b in (4.7), which in turn is the same

as the reection amplitude in [17]:

ho(k)o(k)i 

2s

0(k)0(k)  (k + k)

b(k)
(ka2)4 .

(4.11)

this result has the correct ir behavior ho(k)o(k)i  k4 log k, but we basically put this
in when we included the k dependent factor in (4.9).4 since the renormalization depends

on the momentum it is not possible to go back to coordinate space in an unambiguous

fashion. this is a reection of the non-local nature of the theory in the ultraviolet. the

situation is essentially the same as in [18].

to study the uv regime, we need to determine the value of b(ka) at large k. as
explained above, by z  z + i/2 in (4.5) this problem is converted into the problem of
calculating the reection coecient for a particle with an energy greater than the potential
barrier. this can be done by using the wkb approximation [19]. for k2a2  1, we nd
the following result:

ht01(k)t01(k)i = exp(cid:2)  c|k|a(cid:3) ,

(4.12)

4 there were some errors in the original version of this paper. as a result, our expressions
did not have the correct ir behaviour (contrary to what was stated in the paper). we thank l.

rastelli and s. das for pointing out this.

13

where

c = 2z /2

0

dx pcos(x) =

2


(3/4)2 = 1.69 .

(4.13)

thus the correlator vanishes in the uv limit k2  . this is a drastic change with
respect to the commutative case. we should remember, however, that we have performed

a momentum dependent renormalization, so there is some ambiguity in this result. we

only expect ratios of three (or higher n) point functions to two-point functions to be

unambiguous.

let us now discuss what we expect from the point of view of eld theory. the argu-

ments of [9] would naively indicate that all calculations in the large n limit should reduce

trivially to the commutative counterparts. we should remember that they had obtained

some phases for the external momenta. dening operators involves taking a particular

superposition of bare operators. it is not easy to nd the gauge invariant operator in the
non-commutative yang-mills theory representing t01(k) (the fourier transform of tr f f
is not gauge invariant). in the presence of b we would take a dierent supperposition of

operators and therefore the results could change.

5. wilson loops

let us rst consider the case when only b23 6= 0. the near-horizon geometry is given
by (2.7). a single string stretching from the horizon to the boundary has the same energy

as in the ads case, i.e. the energy grows with the cuto in the same manner. now suppose

we bring two of these strings close to each other, at dierent points in the x2, x3 plane.

naively one would imagine that they connect and give rise to some potential. this is not
what happens. the nambu-goto action for a single string with x0 =  , u = , xi(u),
i = 2, 3, is given by

(5.1)

s =

r2

2 z dx0duq1 + (uxi)2u4h .

expanding (5.1) for small uctuations xi at large u we get s  r dx0du(uxi)2. this

implies that we cannot x the position of the string at innity since any small perturbation
implies that xi grows linearly with u. we can however specify the slope ki which the string
has as it approaches innity, xi  kiu. we will see below that, in a loose sense, we can
interpret k to be related to some kind of fourier transform of the wilson loop. the wilson
loop operator, which starts extended along the time direction and seems localized in x2, x3,

is now replaced by a new operator which is characterized by the momentum k in the

14

x2, x3 directions. in this way we can calculate the potential energy between a quark with
momentum k with an antiquark with momentum k. this will vanish unless ki = ki.
this can be seen by taking the action (5.1) and noticing that, interpreting u as time
then the canonical momenta conjugate to xi are conserved. so we can choose k to point

in the direction 3. denoting by u0 the coordinate of closest approach to the horizon we

nd that

0(1 + a4u4)
u2qu4  u4
0a4. we can calculate the energy, which is
divergent. the divergent piece depends on k, as we found for the correlation functions.

from the large u behavior we nd that k = u2

x3(u) = z u

du u2

we subtract it and we get a nite answer which is

r22
(1/4)2r1 +

k
a2 .

k2
a4

e = 

(5.3)

in order to make contact with the standard ads expression notice that for small k then u0
will be very small (au0  1). looking at (5.2) we see that we get a large region in the radial
coordinate where we can ignore the term proportional to a4u4. in that case we recover
the ads expression for the coordinate x, and in particular we nd that the separation is

l  1/u0  a2/k. substituting in (5.3) we recover the ads expression, e  1/l. we

did not get this relationship between distance and momentum by performing a fourier

transformation, and it is not standard, that is the reason for the quotation marks in

momentum.

now consider a string conguration in the geometry (2.9) (in the particular case

a = a) of the form

x1 =  ,

x2 =  ,

u = u() ,

x0 = x3 = 0 ,

(5.4)

which is placed at some given angle in the 5-sphere. using eqs. (2.7), (5.4), the action

takes the form

s =

r2

2 z d dphq(u)2 + u4h ,

h =

1

1 + a4u4 .

the solution that minimizes the action is given by

u4h3/2

q(u)2 + u4h

=

e
a2 = const.

,

15

(5.5)

(5.6)

or

eu = u2phqa4u4h2  e2 ,

(5.7)
where e is an integration constant. the equation (5.7) is symmetric under u  1/(a2u)
since the string metric has this symmetry. we have solutions for 0 < e  1/2. if e =
1/2 the solution is a straight worldsheet sitting at u = a, which is the maximum of the

potential that the string sees. for 0 < e < 1/2 the solution oscillates between umin and
umax = 1/(a2umin) as we move in x2 = . umax, umin are solutions of u = 0. the strings
never get to the boundary. if we compactify the x1, x2 directions these solutions describe
nite action worldsheet instantons. in this case e will be quantized so that we have an
integral number of oscillations in the x2 circle. when e  1/2 we get a string conguration
which in the region u  1/a looks like the wilson loops of ads5.

6. generalizations

6.1. d1-d5 system with a b eld

a d1-d5 system with a b eld can be obtained likewise by u-duality. we start with

the usual d1-d5 system in euclidean space, with world-volume coordinates x0, x1, and
make a t-duality transformation in the direction x1, obtaining a d0-d4 bound state with
an extra translational isometry in x1. then we redene coordinates as follows,

x0 = x

0 cos  + x

1 sin  ,

x1 = x

0 sin  + x

1 cos  .

(6.1)

by applying a t-duality transformation in the x
1 direction, we nd (restoring the labels
x0, x1 for the 2-plane coordinates and performing a gauge transformations that changes
the asymptotic value of b)

near u = 0 and near u = , the metric approaches ads3  s3  t 4. although the string
frame metric is symmetric under u  1/(a2u), the dilaton and gauge elds behave dier-
ently in the uv region u = . all these solutions, (6.2)(6.3), preserve 8 supersymmetries.
a d1-d5 conguration with b components in two ve-brane directions y1, y2 which

are transverse to the d1-brane can be obtained as follows. we apply a t-duality in y2,

do a rotation in the y1, y2 plane, a t-duality back on y2 and a gauge transformation to

change the asymptotic value of b. the solution is given by

and we also have rr elds excited corresponding to dp brane charges and d(p 2) brane
charge densities. it is interesting to note that the string coupling decreases faster at innity

than in the commutative case. this suggests that maybe it is possible to dene the non-
commutative version of the d6 brane when we have two b elds5. by taking the large n
limit of this eld theory we would describe m-theory on t 6 according to [20]. from our

count of degrees of freedom above it looks like we will have problems similar to the ones

appearing in the commutative case. in particular, we can calculate the entropy which gives
the same result as in the commutative case. the entropy goes as s  e 3/2, which implies
that the system has a negative specic heat. this does not obviously imply non-decoupling

from the bulk and a more detailed analysis is necessary.

6.2. m5 brane with c-eld

one can similarly nd an m5 brane solution with a c-eld. in this case we get

(6.7)

this solution appeared in [7] (eq. (2.26) ) and it was interpreted as a 2-brane lying within

a 5-brane. one can similarly introduce a decoupling limit in such a way that we obtain
the solution (6.7) but with f  r3/r3. notice that the vebrane charge is given by
n = r3/ cos . the dlcq denition of this theory was considered in [10].

5 this issue was raised by s. kachru.
