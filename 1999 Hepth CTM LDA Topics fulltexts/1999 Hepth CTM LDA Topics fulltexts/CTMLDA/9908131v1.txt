abstract

we use the massless thirring model to demonstrate a new approach
to non-perturbative fermion calculations based on the spherical eld for-
malism. the methods we present are free from the problems of fermion
doubling and diculties associated with integrating out massless fermions.
we compute the two-point correlator and nd agreement with the known
analytic solution.

1 introduction

the massless thirring model [1] is an exactly soluble system of a single self-
interacting massless fermion in two dimensions. there are a number of solu-
tions in the literature based on properties of the euler-lagrange equations and
fermion currents or bosonization techniques [2]-[6]. given its simplicity and
solubility, the model has become a popular testing ground for new ideas and
methods in eld theory.

from a computational point of view, however, the massless thirring model
still presents a signicant challenge. in the lattice eld formalism, the dicul-
ties are due to the appearance of fermion doubler states and singular inversion
problems associated with integrating out massless fermions.
in this work we
use the model to illustrate new non-perturbative methods in the spherical eld
formalism [7]-[9]. the techniques we present are quite general and can also be
applied to other modal expansion methods such as periodic eld theory [10].

as noted in [8], we will not need to worry about fermion doubling. this
is true for any modal eld theory and follows from the fact that space is not
discretized but retained as a continuous variable. since our model is not super-
renormalizable we will use a procedure called angle-smearing, a regularization

method designed for spherical eld theory [9]. with angle-smearing regulariza-
tion and a small set of local counterterms, we are able to remove all ultraviolet
divergences in a manner such that the renormalized theory is nite and trans-
lationally invariant. comparison of our results with the known thirring model
solution will serve as a consistency check for our regularization and renormal-
ization procedures.

the organization of this paper is as follows. we begin with a short summary
of the massless thirring model, following the solution of hagen [4]. using
angle-smearing regularization we obtain the spherical eld hamiltonian and
construct a matrix representation of the hamiltonian. we reduce the space of
states using a two-parameter auxiliary cuto procedure.
in this reduced space
we compute the time evolution of quantum states using a fourth-order runge-
kutta algorithm. we calculate the two point correlator for several values of
the coupling and nd agreement with the known analytic solution.

2 the model

we start with a list of our notational conventions. our analysis will be in two-
dimensional euclidean space, and we use both cartesian and polar coordinates,

~t = (t cos , t sin ) = (x, y).

the components of the spinors  and  are written as

 = (cid:20) 
 (cid:21)

 = (cid:2) 

 (cid:3) .

our representation for the dirac matrices is

and so ~ satises

~ = i~,

the massless thirring model is formally dened by the lagrange density

(cid:8)i, j(cid:9) = 2ij.

l = i ~  ~

~j  ~j,

(5)

where ~j is the fermion vector current. johnson [2] emphasized the importance
of dening the regularized current precisely, and this was further claried by the
work of sommereld [3] and hagen [4]. we will use a regularization technique,
introduced in [9], called angle-smearing. we dene the regularized current as

~j = 1

2 (cid:0) s~s  t r[~s s](cid:1) ,

(6)

where

s(t, ) = m t

d(t,  + ).

(7)

we identify the radial variable t as our time parameter, and our denition of
the current is local with respect to t.

hagen [4] described the solution of the thirring model with currents dened
as products of the canonical operators at equal times. this is the same as our
denition, except that the equal-time surface in (7) is curved. this dierence
though is negligible. the curvature of the integration segment in (7) scales as
1
m while the ultraviolet divergences in this model are only logarithmic in m .
in the m   limit we therefore recover the standard results. as discussed
in [4], there exists a one parameter class of solutions to the thirring model
depending on the preferred denition of the regularized vector and axial vector
currents. we will use the conventions used in [2] and [3], which in hagens
notation corresponds with the parameter values  =  = 1
2 . with this choice
the hamiltonian density takes the form

h = hf ree + c

1c (t  ~j)2 + c

1+c (  ~j)2,

where

c = 
2 .

(8)

(9)

the only counterterms needed in this model are wavefunction renormalization
counterterms, a result of our careful denitions for the regularized currents.
the approach used in [4] is to calculate correlation functions using an unrenor-
malized hamiltonian. this is not a problem since the divergent wavefunction
normalizations appear simply as overall factors in the correlators. we will adopt
this approach in our analysis.

3 spherical eld hamiltonian

in this section we derive the form of the spherical eld hamiltonian. we rst
expand the fermion current in terms of components of the spinors,

t  s~s = i s(cid:20) 0

ei

ei

0

(cid:21) s = iei s s + iei s s

  s~s = s(cid:20)

(cid:21) s = ei s s  ei s s .

the anti-commutators of the regulated elds are1

conventions of [11].

from the anti-commutation relations, the t component of the current is

= iei s s + iei s s  ia(t),

s ) + iei( s s  s

s )(cid:3)

(13)

(14)

(15)

and so

(t  ~j)2 = a(t)(cid:2)ei s s + ei s s(cid:3)  2 s s

similarly we nd

s s  a2(t).

(16)

(  ~j)2 = a(t)(cid:2)ei s s + ei s s(cid:3)  2 s s

the hamiltonian can now be written as

s s .

(17)

h = hf ree +z d tn 2c

1c2 (cid:2)a(t)(cid:2)ei s s + ei s s(cid:3)  2 s s

s s(cid:3)o . (18)

we have omitted the constant term proportional to a2(t).

let us dene the partial wave modes

n(t) = 12 z d ein(~t),
n(t) = 12 z d ein (~t),

s,n(t) = 12 z d eins(~t),
s,n(t) = 12 z d ein s(~t).

it is straightforward to show that for n 6= 0,

s,n(t) = sin( n

m t )
( n

n(t)

s,n(t) = sin( n
m t )
m t )
( n

n(t).

(19)

(20)

(21)

we can extend this result to the case n = 0 using the convenient shorthand

sin( 0

at this point it is convenient to rescale ,
in = t i

since b is the parameter appearing in the hamiltonian, it is somewhat more

let us dene the ladder operators2

(29)

(cid:8)an1 , an2(cid:9) = (cid:8)an1, an2(cid:9) = n1n2 ,

with all other anti-commutators equal to zero. we can now recast the hamil-
tonian as

(cid:20)n + bta(t) sin( n

we will implement a high spin cuto by removing terms in the interaction
containing operators an, an, an , or an for |n| > jmax. this has the eect of
removing high spin modes, which correspond with large tangential momentum
states. we should emphasize, however, that jmax is an auxiliary cuto. it does
not play a role in the regularization scheme since the interactions have already
been rendered nite using angle-smearing. the contribution of these high spin
modes is negligible so long as

jmax

t  m,

(31)

where t is the characteristic radius of the process being measured. returning
back to (12) and (13) and removing the contribution of these partial waves, we
nd that a(t) is replaced by

ajmax (t) = 1

let |0if ree be the ground state of the free massless fermion hamiltonian.3

for n > 0, we nd

and for n  0,

an |0if ree = an |0if ree = 0,

an |0if ree = an |0if ree = 0.

it is convenient to dene the normal-ordered products

:an an: = (cid:26) an an for n > 0
anan for n  0

:an an: = (cid:26) an an for n > 0
anan for n  0.

(33)

(34)

(35)

the ordering for other operators is immaterial since the anti-commutators are
zero. we can now rewrite h in terms of normal-ordered products,

h = (cid:0) n

(cid:21) .

there is an o(j2
max) term due to a small asymmetry in our cuto procedure
with respect to the two boundaries jmax and jmax.4 we will neglect this term
in the limit jmax  .

4 two-point correlator

we wish to study the properties of the two-point correlator. the massless
thirring model is invariant under the discrete transformation

(~t), (~t)  (~t),  (~t),

as well as the transformation

(t, ), (t, )  (t, ), (t, ).

from these we deduce

h0| t (cid:2) (~t)(0)(cid:3) |0i = h0| t (cid:2) (~t)(0)(cid:3) |0i = 0

(37)

(38)

(39)

3the ground state of the free massless hamiltonian is actually degenerate due to s-wave

excitations, but this is remedied by taking the m  0 limit of the massive fermion theory.

4if desired we could eliminate this term and the asymmetry by a slight change in the

angle-smearing procedure for .

6

and

h0| t (cid:2) (t, )(0)(cid:3) |0i = h0| t (cid:2) (t, )(0)(cid:3) |0i .

it therefore suces to consider just the correlator on the left side of (40).

in the limit m   the form of the correlator is given by

(40)

(41)

h0| t (cid:2) (t, )(0)(cid:3) |0i = ei

2 (k(c)m )

2c2
1c2 t

1c2
1c2 ,

where k(c) is a dimensionless parameter. standard analytic methods do not
yield a simple closed form expression for k(c). we will therefore extract k(c)
from the computed value of the correlator at a specic renormalization point
t = t0.5 for later reference we dene

f (t) = h0| t h 1(t)0 (0)i |0i .

since

h0| t (cid:2) (t, )(0)(cid:3) |0i = ei

2 h0| t h 1(t)0 (0)i |0i ,

we conclude that

f (t) = (k(c)m )

2c2
1c2 t

1c2
1c2 .

(42)

(43)

(44)

we now compute f (t) using the spherical eld hamiltonian. we will rst
need a matrix representation for the grassmann ladder operators. one possi-
bility is to use tensor products of the 2  2 identity matrix and pauli matrices:

an = ni=jmax,n+1
an =
ni=jmax,jmax

1 (cid:0) 1
2 x  i
1 ni=jmax,n+1

2 y(cid:1) ni=jmax,n1
1 (cid:0) 1
2 x  i

z ni=jmax,jmax
2 y(cid:1) ni=jmax,n1

z.

z,

(45)

the representations for an and an are dened by the conjugate transposes of
these matrices. we can now calculate the correlator f (t) using the relation [8]

f (t) = lim

.

(46)

a straightforward calculation of (46), however, is rather inecient. there are
several techniques which we will rst use to simplify the calculation.

5in some regularization schemes k(c) can be calculated analytically [3][6], and it may be
worthwhile to use these techniques in future work.
in this rst analysis, however, we prefer
to present a more straightforward and typical example of the angle-smearing regularization
method.

the time evolution of the system at large t is dominated by the contribution
of the ground state or, more precisely, the adiabatic ow of the t-dependent
ground state. as discussed in [7] a similar phenomenon occurs at small t, due
it is therefore not necessary to
to the divergence of energy levels near t = 0.
compute the full matrix trace in the numerator and denominator of (46).
it is
instead sucient to compute the corresponding ratio for a single matrix element.
after making this reduction, we can then go a step further and eliminate states
which do not contribute to the matrix element.

the high spin parameter jmax was used to remove high spin modes with
|n| > jmax. this, however, is not a uniform cuto in the space of states and
most of the remaining states are still high kinetic energy states. although none
of the individual modes are energetic, many of the modes can be simultaneously
excited. let us dene nn and nn to be bit switches, 1 or 0, depending on
whether or not the corresponding mode is excited. let us also dene a cuto
parameter kmax. we will remove all high kinetic energy states such that

pn(cid:2)|n| (nn + nn)(cid:3) > kmax.

(47)

for consistency kmax should be about the same size as jmax, and in our calcu-
lations we will choose

kmax = 2jmax + 2.

(48)

5 results

the cpu time and memory requirement for calculating (46) scales linearly with
the number of transitions in h (i.e., non-zero elements in our matrix represen-
tation).
in table 1 we have shown the number of states and transitions for
dierent values of jmax.

we have calculated f (t) for jmax  12 and several values of the coupling b. the
total run time was about 100 hours on a 350 mhz pc with 256 mb ram.

the matrix time evolution equations in (46) were computed using a fourth-

order runge-kutta algorithm. as stated before we have set

kmax = 2jmax + 2.

(49)

we will use the notation fjmax(t) to identify the corresponding result for a given
value of jmax. in figure 1 we have plotted fjmax(t) for b = 1 and jmax = 4, 8, 12.
we have scaled t and f (t) in dimensional units chosen such that m = 3. for
nite jmax we expect deviations from the jmax   limit to be of size o( m 2 t2
).
the curves shown in figure 1 appear consistent with this rate of convergence.

we can extrapolate to the limit jmax   using the asymptotic form

fjmax(t) = f(t) + j2

(50)

for b = 0, .5, 1., 3. and m = 3 we have calculated f (t) using this extrapolation
technique for jmax = 10 and 12.6 the results are shown in figure 2. for

(51)

the relation between b and c can be found in (25) and (26). the parameter
k(c) is tted to value of the correlator at the renormalization point t = 0.6.7
the agreement appears quite good. some deviations from the analytic solution
are due to o(
m 2t2 ) residual terms, which were left out of the derivation of (51).
these eects are signicant in the small t region, t . m1, especially for larger
values of b. the values we nd for k(c) are shown in table 2.8

6 summary

we derived the angle-smeared spherical hamiltonian for the massless thirring
model and constructed an explicit matrix representation. we discarded negligi-
ble high energy states using auxiliary cuto parameters jmax and kmax. in this
reduced space we computed the time evolution of quantum states and calculated
the two-point correlator for several values of the coupling. the results of our
computation are in close agreement with the known analytic solution.
in addi-
tion to demonstrating new computational methods, our analysis also serves as a
consistency check of the regularization and renormalization methods introduced
in [9].

we believe that this work represents a signicant new direction in the non-
perturbative computation of fermion dynamics. future work will study the
application of these methods to systems of interacting bosons and fermions.

6both our results and the analytic solution are even in b, and so we consider only positive

values.

7the relative error is expected to be small in the vicinity of this point.
8in some regularization schemes k(c) can be shown to be independent of the coupling. our
regularization method seems to be rather close to this, with only a slow variation with respect
to the coupling strength.
