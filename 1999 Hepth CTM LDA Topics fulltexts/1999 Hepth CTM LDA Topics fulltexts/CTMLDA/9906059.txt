( signicance disconnected gauge groups discussed refs. ,,,. non-trivial mean exclude, example, direct products nite groups e8 e8, little physical interest.) so(32) cases ( type heterotic ) much less straightforward, many non-trivial groups lie algebra so(n); fact, eight non-trivial groups so(32) algebra. known beginning  string theory selects eight group known physics literature spin(32)/z2 - unfortunate convention, exacerbates tendency confuse group so(32). group closely associated ( essentially dened ) half-spin representations spin(32), propose name semispin(32) it. shall see, non-trivial disconnected lie group semispin(32) identity component, gauge group connected case. summarise : heterotic string theories x global structures gauge groups. one theory uses disconnected simply connected group (e8 e8) z2, 5 uses connected simply connected group semispin(32). semispin groups perhaps least familiar compact simple lie groups, venerable tradition treating semispin(4m) so(4m). wish argue tradition outlived usefulness, string theory forces us fully aware dierences semispin(4m) groups algebra. two physically signicant kinds distinction, one representation - theoretic, topological. first, note ambiguities often arisen past, one groups question always cover other. example, so(10) grand unication  uses certain 16 - dimensional multiplet correspond representation so(10). is, course, representation spin(10). one solve problem simply reading spin(10) so(10); harm done, every representation so(10) automatically representation spin(10), latter cover former. opposite direction, one normally writes su (3) su (2) u (1) (su (3) su (2) u (1)/z6, true group , ill eects every representation latter representation former. novelty string theory neither so(32) semispin(32) cover other. consequently, representations cannot regarded representations other. situation quite dierent supercially analogous ambiguities arising earlier gauge theories. secondly, exist semispin(32) gauge congurations (over topologically non - trivial space - times ) considerable physical importance, cannot interpreted so(32) gauge congurations ,. reader might argue one likewise construct so(10) congurations lift spin(10). point, however, ordinary gauge theory provide fundamental justication thinking so(10) important. string theory, contrast, favour semispin(32) so(32). analysis semispin(32) bundles cannot regarded spin(32) so(32) bundles therefore physically signicant. finally, study duality  brings points together potentially confusing way. t-duality two heterotic theories relies relating e8e8 so(32) supposed common subgroup, so(16)so(16). global investigation shows common subgroup exists; worse still, neither actual respective subgroups covers ; worse yet again, represen- tations representations other, crucial establishing duality. solving problem leads topological obstructions, and, back- 6 ground, one wilson loops behaving way depends delicately global structure various subgroups semispin(32) semispin(16). short, local simplicity duality argument conceals considerable complexity global level. purpose work solve problems, rather give useful survey aspects semispin groups ( subgroups ) directly relevant string theory. main emphasis structure groups rather representations, since latter well understood since former needed dealing topological obstructions analysing eect wilson loops. begin brief survey family non - trivial lie groups algebra so(n). ii. groups algebra so(n). order understand ways semispin(4m) diers groups lie algebra, useful begin complete classication. refer reader ref. basic techniques, ref. much simpler account. shall assume gauge group connected : already seen would justiable one heterotic theory. hand, true disconnected lie groups little physical interest. every compact lie group expressed nite union connected components, g = g0 ,,. however, given component, g0, give rise eects cannot chosen commute every element g0. physically interesting disconnected groups none chosen commute every element g0. group called natural extension identity component. example, (e8 e8) z2 natural extension e8 e8, fact natural extension. ( convenient adopt convention connected group natural 7 extension itself. ) henceforth, conne attention disconnected groups natural extensions identity components. next, denitions. let p in(n), n 2, dened usual  terms cliord algebra basis {ei}. write p in(n) natural extension spin(n), n even : p in(2m) = spin(2m). think {1, k2m} rst z2, {1, k2m} second, {1} diagonal. course, spin(n)/{1} = so(n) n 2. n odd, so(n) natural extension itself, n even two others. rst o(2m), may expressed o(2m) = so(2m), automorphism order three. combines ad(e1) give d6, dihedral group order six. triality maps k8 1, fact semispin(8) = so(8). dimension semispin construction gives nothing new. triality descend so(8) (because preserve {1}) descend p so(8). position state following theorem, proof application techniques given refs.  . 9 theorem 1 : let g compact lie group natural extension identity component. lie algebra g isomorphic so(n), n 2, g globally isomorphic group following list: (1) n = 2 : so(2), o(2), p in(2). (2) n = odd : so(n), spin(n). (3) n = 4m + 2, 1 : spin(n), p in(n), spin(n) z2, so(n), o(n), oi(n), p so(n), p o(n). (4) n = 4m, 6= 2 : spin(n), p in(n), so(n), o(n), oi(n), p so(n), p o(n), semispin(n). (5) n = 8 : spin(8), p in(8), spin(8) z3, spin(8) d6, so(8), o(8), oi(8), p so(8), p o(8), p so(8) z3, p so(8) d6. note spin(4) = su (2) su (2), p so(4) = so(3) so(3), semispin(4) = su (2) so(3). these, then, non-trivial distinct groups corresponding so(n) algebra. n 32, fewer eight candidates. string theory selects particular group among eight following extraordinary way. heterotic theories, gauge elds arise connection lattice momenta sixteen- dimensional torus. lattice must even self - dual. crucial point requirements impose conditions merely root system gauge group, also integral lattice . however, deep connection integral lattice global structure compact, connected lie group. thus string theory provides route strictly physical conditions directly global structure ( identity component ) gauge group. well known, semispin(32) satises conditions, so(32), spin(32), p so(32) not. argument completed glance theorem 1 : see spin(32) p so(32) non-trivial disconnected version, so(32) two, semispin(32) none. precise global structure gauge group thereby xed : semispin(32). close section remarks representation theory spin(4m), semispin(4m), so(4m), p so(4m). recall basic faithful representation spin(4m), obtained  suitably restricting irreducible representation cliord algebra, canonical decomposition 4m = + 4m 4m, 10 4m 4m representation kernel {1, k4m} 4m kernel {1, k4m}. + 4m faithful ; one must take sum. hence + thus, neither + 4m 4m called half-spin representations. evidently faithful spin(4m) group (accordingly) call semispin(4m). half-spin repre- sentations dimension 22m1. thus so-called 128-dimensional representation so(16) plays prominent role string theory fact dening represen- tation semispin(16). again, dening representation semispin(32) 32, 768 - dimensional, decidedly inconvenient value. fortunately, p so(32) = semispin(32)/z2, every representation p so(32) automatically representation semispin(32); thus, latter manageable (but unfaithful) 496 - dimensional representa- tion, also unfaithful representation so(32) spin(32), namely adjoint. similarly p so(16) yields 120 - dimensional representation semispin(16), latter faithful 248 - dimensional representation dened direct sum, 120 128. representation faithful, (likewise faithful) ad- joint e8 decomposes 248 = 120 128, immediately shows e8 contains semispin(16) not, often said, so(16). thus (e8 e8) z2 max- imal subgroup form (semispin(16) semispin(16)) z2, see semispin groups appear heterotic string theories. fact, witten {$9810188$} recently argued true type theory. gauge group type perturbative level p o(32) ( see theorem 1). group disconnected, semispin(32) non-trivial disconnected version, appears obstruct supposed s-duality type so(32) heterotic string theories . however, witten shows subtle non-perturbative eect breaks p o(32) p so(32) = semispin(32)/z2; furthermore, appear type non-perturbative states transforming spinorially gauge group. ( note that, like spinor, semispinor odd 2 rotation; non-trivial element centre semispin(32) projection 1 spin(32). ) short, gauge group type string theory undoubtedly semispin(32) precisely, so(32). semispin groups appear three string theories non-trivial gauge groups. appears bode well duality : particular, since (e8 e8) z2 con- tains (semispin(16) semispin(16)) z2, one would expect group appear semispin(32) side. fact, case, show. iii. subgroups semispin(4m) corresponding 11 so(k) so(4m k) evidently so(32) contains so(16) so(16) block - diagonally; generally, so(4m) contains so(k) so(4m k), k 2. product indeed direct, since so(k) so(4mk) intersect trivially, {i4m}. however, spin(4m) contain spin(k) spin(4m k), factors contain {1}. fact, subgroup spin(k) spin(4m k), local direct product, spin(k) spin(4m k) = (spin(k) spin(4m k))/z2, z2 generated (1, 1). another important dierence so(4m) spin(4m) area. clear that, k = 2j even, spin(k) spin(4m k) characterised group spin(4m) elements commute ( is, centraliser ) k2j. k2j projects so(4m) matrix diag (i2j, i4m2j) = k2j, so(4m) centraliser k2j so(2j) so(4m 2j); rather, disconnected subgroup s(o(2j) o(4m 2j)), set pairs (a, b) o(2j) o(4m 2j) det = det b. is, wilson loop breaks spin(4m) connected subgroup break so(4m) disconnected subgroup. ( recall  wilson loop gauge theory closed curve space-time non-trivial holonomy element even vacuum. gauge group broken centraliser (usually nite) subgroup generated holonomy element. ) turn case semispin(4m). suppose rst k odd. spin(k) spin(4m k) contain k4m, unaected projection spin(4m) semispin(4m). thus, k odd, subgroup semispin(4m) corresponding so(k) so(4m k) globally isomorphic spin(k) spin(4m k). next, suppose k = 2j even multiple 4. 4m 2j likewise even multiple 4, spin(2j) spin(4m 2j) z4 centres generated respectively k2j k2j+1,4m. k2j k4m = k2j+1,4m k2j+1,4m k4m = k2j, eect factoring k4m identify entire centre spin(4m 2j) spin(2j). have, j odd, spin(2j) spin(4m 2j) = (spin(2j) spin(4m 2j))/z4 12 subgroup semispin(4m) corresponding so(2j) so(4m 2j). finally, k = 4j multiple 4, 4m 4j spin(4j) spin(4m 4j) centres isomorphic z2 z2. centres {1, k4j} {1, k4j+1,4m} respectively, since k4j k4m = k4j+1,4m k4j+1,4m k4m = k4j, see that, again, eect projection spin(4m) semispin(4m) identify entire centre spin(4m 4j) spin(4j). use notation spin(4j) spin(4m 4j) = (spin(4j) spin(4m 4j))/(z2 z2). next, recall that, physical point view, interested obtaining 2j projection k2j semispin(4m). centraliser k groups centralisers element semispin(4m). saw earlier centraliser k2j spin(4m) connected, k2j so(4m) not. let k 2j include spin(2j) spin(4m2j), wil also include semispin(4m) element l l, lift l spin(4m), satises l k2j = k4m k2j l. projecting so(4m), nd corresponding matrices satisfy l k2j l1 = k2j, whence trace k2j = 4(m j) = 0. thus j 6= m, l exist, centraliser k spin(4m 2j). j = m, 2j semispin(4m) precisely spin(2j) j2m k2m j 1 2m = k2m, j2m = (cid:18) 0 i2m 0 (cid:19) . i2m solution essentially unique. corresponding element spin(4m) (see ref. , page 174, modify suitably ) j2m = 2m(1 e1 e1+2m)(1 e2 e2+2m) . . . (1 e2m e4m). k2m j2m = 2m(e1 + e1+2m)(e2 + e2+2m) . . . (e2m + e4m) 13 = 2m(e1+2m + e1)(e2+2m + e2) . . . (e4m + e2m) = j2m k1+2m,4m = (1)m k4m j2m k2m since ( k2m)2 = (1)m k2m k1+2m,4m = k4m. thus even, projections semispin(4m) satisfy k 2m required. odd, project instead spin(4m)/{1, k4m} recall isomorphic semispin(4m). exercise cliord algebra shows 2m = j 2mk 2mj ( j2m)2 = (1)m k4m, appropriate projections order two. eect spin(2m) spin(2m) 2m exchange two factors. conclude centraliser conjugation j k 2j semispin(4m) spin(2j) spin(4m 2j) j 6= (spin(2m) spin(2m)) z2 j = m. finally, let us consider specic case semispin(32). so(16) so(16) spin(16)) z2 full centre spin(16) subgroup actually (spin(16) identied other, z2 exchanges two factors. compare so(16) so(16) subgroup (e8 e8) z2, (semispin(16) semispin(16)) z2. groups exchange z2, welcome point view -duality. spin(16) spin(16) isomorphic semispin(16) semispin(16). z2 z2 quotients spin(16) spin(16), z2 z2 acts dierently case. implies neither cover other, representations cannot regarded representations other. example, factoring {1} spin(16) spin(16), obtain so(16) so(16), dot means two factors non-trivial intersection, { i16}. tensor product vector itself, (16, 16), faithful group, representation spin(16) spin(16). representation con- tains faithful copies so(16), something impossible representation semispin(16) semispin(16). hand, let (128, 1) (1, 128) dening representation semispin(16) semispin(16); representation distin- guishes centres two semispin(16) factors, cannot happen rep- spin(16) resentation spin(16) {1, k16}, obtain semispin(16) semispin(16), two factors in- tersect {1}, use 1 denote projection 1 spin(16); spin(16). ( take quotient spin(16) 14 (128, 1)(1, 128) descend representation group. ) two groups representations common, (128, 128) (120, 1) (1, 120), latter dening representation p so(16) p so(16), z2 z2 quotient semispin(16)semispin(16) spin(16) spin(16). however, (120, 1) (1, 120) important duality, also (16, 16) (128, 1) (1, 128). see, then, appearance semispin groups heterotic theories somewhat deceptive; semispin(4m) strangely unlike spin(4m) so(4m). last contain subgroups kind themselves, spin(2j) 2j) so(2j)so(4m2j) respectively, semispin(4m) contain semispin(2j) spin(4m semispin(4m 2j). instead, contains spin(2j) spin(4m 2j). thus arrive disconcerting fact e8 e8 contains semispin groups, semispin(32) not. common so(16)so(16) subgroup appears duality literature fails isomorphic so(16) so(16): simply exist. one way approach problem nd group covers semispin(16) semispin(16) spin(16) spin(16), since representations groups representations group. one obvious choice spin(16) spin(16), better alternative, constructed follows. write spin(16) spin(16) spin(16)l spin(16)r let {1l, k l 16} respective centres. dene 16}, {1r, k r spin(16) spin(16) = (spin(16) spin(16))/{(1l, 1r), ( k l 16, k r 16)}. is, identify k r 16 k l 16. factoring element produces semispin(16)semispin(16), factoring (1l, 1r) produces spin(16) is, spin(16) spin(16) double cover semispin(16) semispin(16) spin(16) spin(16). hence (16, 16), (128, 1) (1, 128), (120, 1) (1, 120) (unfaithful) representations spin(16) spin(16), (16, 16) (128, 1) (1, 128) spin(16). faithful representation spin(16) spin(16), though representation spin(16), much less so(16) so(16). (it semispin(16) semispin(16) spin(16) faithful k16, one non-trivial element spin(16) spin(16) mapped identity (128, 1) (1, 128), acts 1 (16, 16).) fact, spin(16)spin(16) gauge group unique tachyon-free 10 dimen- sional non-supersymmetric heterotic string theory ,, plays central role recent investigations strong-coupling duality . massless spectrum the- ory consists gravity multiplet, spacetime vectors assigned (120, 1)(1, 120), 15 spacetime spinors assigned so(16)so(16) representation (16, 16)(128, 1) (1, 128), which, seen, faithful representation spin(16) spin(16). claim, then, string theorists so(16) so(16) actually spin(16) spin(16). strange feature conclusion spin(16)spin(16) sub- group either e8 e8 semispin(32).

( argument would work u (2m + 1) subgroup so(4m + 2), indeed cover u (2m + 1) spin(4m + 2) isomorphic u (2m + 1).) fact, dicult see spin(4m) contains (u (1) su (2m))/zm, consists pairs m. group, m identity, though 2m = 1; therefore m corresponds 1 spin(4m). another important element order two group, m, course others, m. order determine structure subgroup semispin(4m) corresponding u (2m), must determine corresponds k4m. theorem 3 : let semiu (2m) denote projection (u (1) su (2m)/zm semispin(4m). global structure semiu (2m) given follows : semiu (2m) = /zm/2, even = /zm, odd. proof: embedding u (2m) so(4m), matrix j2m arises u (2m) matrix i2m, 2m. thus see spin(4m) element j2m 17 dened preceding section must either m m. either case ( j2m)2 = m. recall ( j2m)2 = (1)m k4m agreed dene semispin(4m) spin(4m)/{1, (1)m k4m} convenience, 2m always order two. ( see remarks end section. ) thus j odd, must factor k4m = m 6= m. clearly, factoring aect u (1) su (2m). however, u (1)/z2 = u (1), since map u u2 group epimorphism innite abelian group. thus obtain /zm odd. even, k4m m, equal m. factoring aect u (1) su (2m) case, and, it, z2 zm act trivially; obtain (u (1)/z2) (su (2m)/z2), eective action zm/2. hence group /zm/2, completes proof. notice that, according theorem, semiu (2) = /z1 = so(2) su (2), indeed subgroup semispin(4) = so(3) su (2). again, semiu (4) = /z1 = so(2) so(6), contained so(8) = semispin(8). clearly semiu (2m) identity component centraliser, semispin(4m), 2m, projection j2m. recall that, unlike j2m so(4m) j2m spin(4m) j (which order 4), j 2m order 2; important applications ,. example, consider semispin(32) heterotic theory compactied k3 surface kummer surface orbifold limit, point - like instanton singular point . excising point, obtain neighbourhood retracts projective sphere, 3/z2. j 16 order four, could realised holonomy element 3/z2, gauge group would break. j 16 order two, realised holonomy 3/z2.

( note full cover sp(1) sp(m) spin(4m), even, actually z2 sp(1) sp(m), z2 = {1}; projects z2 so(3) p sp(m), one might give correct subgroup semispin(4m).) vi. conclusion semispin groups fundamental importance string theory. gauge groups type one heterotic theories semispin(32) precisely, spin(10) e8 contains semispin(16); latter turn contains (see theorem 2) spin(6) = /z4, provides possible route spin(10) grand uni- cation. facts alone warrant detailed study semispin groups remark- able subgroups. theorem 1 places semispin(4m) context entire family non-trivial groups locally isomorphic so(n), theorems 2,3, 4 list important subgroups. hope theorems useful reference string theorists. surprising nding investigation doubt fact semispin groups contain smaller semispin groups. implies common so(16) so(16) subgroup e8 e8 semispin(32) simply exist, obviously problem duality. problem overcome going common double cover, certain topological obstructions vanish. circumstances, therefore, duality obstructed topologically. shall study phenomenon else- where. 23
