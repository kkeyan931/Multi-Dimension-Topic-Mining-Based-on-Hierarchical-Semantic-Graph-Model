in this paper we count the numbers of real and complex solutions to bethe
constraints in the two particle sector of the xxz model. we nd exact number
of exceptions to the string conjecture and total number of solutions which is
required for completeness.

i. introduction

integrable spin chains have proven to be useful in studying various theoretical ideas
in eld theory and statistical physics.
in continuum limit, one can relate spin chains to
massive thirring model, sine-gordon theory, liouville theory and others [1], [2]. faddeev
and korchensky [3] suggested their possible relevance for qcd. connection to matrix models
was also suggested [4]. a very successful method in solving spin chains and in general
integrable models both on a lattice and in the continuum is the bethe ansatz [5,6]. despite
the fact that a lot is known about this method there is still one set of open questions
concerning the so called string conjecture [7,8].

the bethe ansatz method leads to a set of transcendental equations (called bethe con-
straints) for momenta of quasiparticles. in usual search for solutions of these equations a
simplifying assumption is made, the already mentioned string conjecture. this conjecture,
which we shall afterwards formulate more precisely, classies the complex solutions for mo-
menta of quasiparticles. it is well known that there are exceptions to the string conjecture
near the antiferromagnetic ground state [911]. recently, exceptions have been found [12,13]
already in two particle sector of the xxx spin chain. similar results have been found for

the hubbard model [14]. in the case of the xxx spin chain the number of missing solu-
tions (compared to the string conjecture prediction) was found to be n where n is the
number of degrees of freedom. a certain class of real solutions not allowed by the string
conjecture was observed by juttner and dorfel [15] in the xxz chain. however, a systematic
investigation of complex solutions and thus of exceptions to the string conjecture is missing.
there are several reasons why it would be desirable to understand the limits of validity
of the string conjecture or equivalently to have a clear understanding of nature and number
of real and complex solutions for momenta of quasiparticles. one reason is that it was used
in literature as a tool to obtain various results. one example are for instance completeness
proofs of bethe states [5,14,1620]. other example are investigations which use a lattice
regularization of eld theoretical models [21]. in such cases the results at orders which are
lower than n may depend on modications of even a single root as these authors stress. as
is well known the string conjecture was also used by bergkno and thacker [22] in deriving
breather states of the massive thirring model. this was recently criticised on the basis of
numerical analysis of bethe equations. a recent numerical calculations independent of bethe
ansatz and based on the lattice regularization [23] led to the usual bound state spectrum of
the massive thirring model thus suggesting that the question raised by previously mentioned
authors could be related to understanding of the string conjecture and its violations. this
result is based on assumption of equivalence of sine-gordon and the massive thirring model.
another calculation for the massive thirring model itself is in progress [24].

in this paper we shall classify all solutions (both complex and real) in two particle
sector of the xxz model. that will allow us to nd the number of exceptions to the string
conjecture for a given coupling constant and a given number of lattice sites n. we shall in
particular nd that the number of exceptions to the string conjecture in thermodynamical
limit is nite, except for the value of the coupling constant in which it coincides with the
xxx model and what is consistent with previously found result [12,13].

we shall consider the xxz spin chain dened with the following hamiltonian

h =

n

xn=1(cid:16)x

nx

n+1 + y

ny

n+1 + z

n+1(cid:17) ,

(1.1)

this hamiltonian acts in n 2 dimensional hilbert space h = (c)n . in the bethe
ansatz method one introduces the basis states |n1...nmi with m spins down, where the
numbers n1, ..., nm denote the lattice positions of the down spins. with |0i we denote the
state with all spins up. a general element of the above dened hilbert space and thus in
particular the eigenstates of the hamiltonian can than be written in the sector with m spins
down as

|mi =

1n1n2...nm n

m (n1...nm )|n1...nmi.

(1.2)

the bethe method consists in searching for hamiltonian eigenstates in the form

m (n1...nm ) = xp

(1.3)

where the sum runs over elements of the permutation group sm . the momenta ki, i =
1, ..., m and phase shifts j,i have to be determined from the eigenvalue equation and pe-
riodicity requirement on functions m (n1...nm ). the well known procedure gives following

sometimes it is useful to introduce a transformation from pseudomomenta ki, i = 1, ..., m
to rapidity variables xi, i = 1, ..., m with following relation

the string conjecture states that solutions of these equations form string congurations with
rapidities that are forming strings of length n. rapidities in string have common real parts
and equidistant imaginary parts. more precisely, a string of order (length) n and parity +
or  is a set of n rapidities

where   0, k = 1, ..., n and xn
a is real. insertion of these assumed forms in (1.9) gives
equations for real parts of strings, which are similar to (1.7) with one common bethe number
(integer) i for each string. in addition, a part of the string conjecture was that no two strings
of the same length can have same integers i. this assumptions together with inequalities
derived in [7] for numbers i allow one to count the number of string solutions of equations
(1.9). in this paper we shall not use equations which are consequence of string conjecture.
however, for the future comparison we mention that in the sector m = 2 the following
number of solutions for strings of length 2 can be obtained

ns = 2[

where [x] denotes integer part of x.

ii. two particle sector and complex solutions

we want now to analyse bethe equations without assuming the string conjecture. for
simplicity we shall treat the two particle sector. in this sector bethe constraints (1.7) read

n k1 + 1,2 = 21,
n k2  1,2 = 22.

(2.1)
(2.2)

here we want in particular to look for complex solutions. due to reality of energy and
momentum, k1 and k2 have to be complex conjugates of each other

we can express kr and ki by taking sum and dierence of equations (2.1) and (2.2)

k1 = kr + iki,
k2 = kr  iki.

kr =


n

(1 + 2),

in ki = (1  2)  2 arctan

 sin(iki)

cos kr   cos(iki)

.

(2.3)
(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

further straightforward manipulation allows to introduce a simple equation for ki in terms
of kr. so the nal set of equations, which we shall consider, is the equation (2.5) for kr and
the equations for ki

sinh(ki( n
sinh(ki

cosh(ki( n

n

cos

cos

odd,

1 + 2

even.

(2.7)

(2.8)

we shall distinguish solutions of equation (2.7) and call them s-solutions (strings) from
those of equation (2.8) which we shall call c-solutions (strings). in fact these equations will
give a basis for a natural classication of solutions. any solution in the two particle sector
will depend only on the sum of bethe numbers and its parity. a choice of dierent bethe

numbers that gives the same sum (e.g. (cid:16) 3

2 , 1

2(cid:17) ,(cid:16) 1
2(cid:17)) corresponds to taking dierent
2 , 1

branches of the phase shift in (2.1) and (2.2). as we shall see later, number of solutions will
be dierent in these two classes and exceptions to the string conjecture will be due to the
class s only. as the sum of bethe numbers can be taken between n + 1 and n  1 for
n even and between n and n  2 for n odd, we see that kr can take 2n  1 dierent
equidistant values between  and . from equations (2.7) and (2.8) (and fig. 1) we see
that admissible interval for cos kr is

s-strings :

c-strings :

0  cos kr < (1 
0  cos kr <

n

),

(2.9)

(2.10)

s-strings : (1 
c-strings :  < cos kr  0

) < cos kr  0,

2
n

(2.11)

(2.12)

for   0 ( 
with

2    ). the energy of complex solutions, according to (1.5), will be given

e = 4  4 cos kr cosh ki.

(2.13)

here we measure the energy from the referent state with all spins up. due to relations (2.8)
and (2.7) one can see that energy intervals for complex solutions are

0 < e(c-strings)  2,
8
< e(s-strings)  2.
n

(2.14)

(2.15)

now the left side of both equations (2.7), (2.8) are monotonously decreasing functions so we
shall have a solution for ki for any kr whose cos kr is in the previously mentioned interval.
for large n we can approximate admissible interval for s-strings with that for c-strings. in
that case complex solutions will exist if their real parts satisfy inequality 0  cos kr  .
as we have 2n 1
2

solutions per unit kr interval, we conclude that

1
2

(2n  1)(  2)

(2.16)

solutions in form of strings can be obtained. this is consistent (up to at most two solutions)
with the string conjecture and result (1.12).

iii. number of bound states (complex solutions) and

violation of the string hypothesis

2 . as kr tends to 

we want to determine the number of bound states as a function of the coupling constant
 and number of sites n. we shall rst consider complex solutions for xed n and dierent
. in fig. 2 the case n = 40 is presented. for each (calculated)  real parts of possible
complex solutions are given. we see that in region of negative coupling constant the complex
solutions are present for 
2  |kr|   and in the region of positive coupling constant for
0  |kr|  
2 , ki increases and so the localisation of two spins down
increases (notice that the ratio of probability amplitudes for nding spins down on lattice
sites n1 and n2 is proportional to exp |ki(n1  n2 + 1)|). as we decrease the coupling
constant ||, bound states with |kr|  || for   0 and with |kr|  || for   0 disappear.
these are states with the smallest localisation. the bound states with high localisation
(ki high, kr  
2 ) exist in almost all the region of coupling constant and disappear near the
free theory point ( = 0). in fig. 3 and 4 we present numerical analysis of n dependence
of string solutions for  6= 1 and  = 1. in  = 1 case c-strings are allowed for all values
of  
2 and so their number rises linearly with n as predicted by (2.16) and the

2  kr  

5

n  cos kr

string conjecture. however, the number of s-strings rises also linearly with n until the real
parts do not reach the region where 1  2
  1 when such s-string is no more a
solution of bethe equations. so rst two strings disappear for n = 22, next for 62, 121 etc.
simultaneously with disappearance of s-strings two real solutions with the same (odd) sum
of bethe numbers appear. odd sum of bethe numbers can be accomplished by two equal
bethe numbers (which is found by numerically calculation, which favours the choice of the
principal branch of the phase shift) and both properties (disappearance of complex solution
and appearance of real solution with two same bethe numbers) represent violations of the
string conjecture. these results are consistent with the results of [12,13]. for  6= 1 however
we shall nd a dierent result. from fig. 3 we can see that again for certain values of n
s-strings will disappear and evolve in two close real momenta for which we nd identical
bethe numbers. these exceptional real solutions will disappear again after some n, when
followed by the numerical iteration method. this is in contrast to the  = 1 case. in fact
when the solutions are described by more natural classication (equations (2.7) and (2.8)
for complex solutions and equations (4.2) and (4.3) for real solutions) one could follow their
further development. however, here we were interested specically in the choice of equal
bethe numbers when solving equations (2.1) and (2.2) directly.

we proceed now to give an analytical expression for number of exceptions to the string
conjecture. due to the previous discussion we nd that the exceptions arise only due to the
equation (2.7), which has no solutions in the following interval for the sum of bethe numbers

(1

n

) 

cos 

n (1 + 2)

(1 + 2)

odd.

(3.1)

now consider inequality (3.1) rst for  = 1. the maximal kr for which s-solutions would
still not be possible can be found by expanding cos 
n)2,

n (1 + 2) around zero. we nd

(1 + 2)2 < (

(3.2)

2


where n is number of sites after which two complex solutions (for +kr and kr) disappear
and become solutions with two real momenta and 1 = 2. for 1 + 2 = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... we get
n = 3, 22, 62, 121, ... . as previously said, this is consistent with [12,13].

now we turn to general  6= 1. consider k1

interval (3.1). they satisfy

r and k2

r which are just on the edges of the

2 sin(

r + k2

r  k2

) =

n

.

from this relation the interval kr for which s-strings are missing is given with

kr = 2 arcsin



n sin( arccos +arccos (1 2
n )

number of s-strings per unit interval of kr is

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

2

here 2n 1
is due the fact that we have to count the number of odd values of 1 + 2. as
solutions come in pairs (positive and negative total momenta) we need the last factor of two.
finally number of missing strings is an integer part of

n =

2n  1



arcsin



n sin( arccos +arccos (1 2

)

(3.6)

the function (3.6) is shown in fig. 5 for few values of n. we can see that the number of
missing strings is nite for  6= 1 and that there is no violation of the string hypothesis
below some value of coupling constant . these strings would have energies (2.13) in the
forbidden interval 0  e  8

n which is near the energy of the state with all spins up.

iv. number of real solutions and completeness problem

in this chapter we shall search for real solutions of bethe equations. we start again
from the equations (2.1) and (2.2). after manipulating their dierence and sum we obtain
following equations for k = k1 + k2 and k1  k2

from condition (4.1) we can nd number of dierent momenta k. as was already mentioned
there are 2n  1 dierent values of 1 + 2. but changing 1 + 2 by n is equivalent with
changing one quasimomentum by 2 what gives the same solution. this reduces the number
of possible values 1 +2 to n e.g. 1 +2 = 0, 1, ..., n1. left hand sides of equations (4.2)
and (4.3) are periodic functions. thus in principle for each of n dierent xed values of the
right hand side one can count number of solutions by counting number of intersections. for
a given value of the 1 + 2 and  we can nd following number x of intersections for n
even

for 1 + 2 even and odd, respectively. for n odd

in this paper string conjecture has exceptions. however, they do not aect completeness
proofs because disappearance of complex solution (bound state) results in appearance of
real solution and vice versa so that total number is unchanged.

total number of solutions is (cid:16)n

as we have explained already, analysis was done for simplicity reasons in the two particle
sector. of course a systematic analysis for higher sectors may be desirable but it is much
more complicated. however, we mention some preliminary results for the m = 3 sector. by
numerical analysis we search for exceptions to string conjecture among real solutions with
coinciding two or all bethe numbers. they are exhibited in fig. 6 and fig. 7 for  = 1 and
 = 0.95. they show similar regularities as m = 2 case. in particular with appearance of
real solutions violating string conjecture in two particle sector in the three particle sector
such exceptions arise in the form of perturbed pair of near momenta (of identical bethe
numbers in m = 2 sector) and a third almost independent momenta with a distinct bethe
number. for instance fig. 6 for  = 1 shows appearance of such solutions around n = 22
similar to the fig. 4 for m = 2 and  = 1. on the fig. 7 for  = 0.95 we see that
such solutions are found in nite intervals of n. this is again same as in m = 2 case (fig.
3). finally this preliminary investigation for larger m rises hope that a simple pattern for
exception to string conjecture could arise.

v. conclusion

f in this paper we count all complex and real solutions of bethe equations in the two
particle sector. the complex solutions are classied in two classes. for one of them (s-class)
the sum of bethe numbers is odd and for the other (c-class) it is even. we are able to
count number of solutions in each class for a given coupling constant  and number n of
lattice sites. in such a way we are able to check the validity of usual string conjecture. we
nd that there are exceptions to string conjecture and that they are entirely due to the
s-class of solutions. in particular in the thermodynamic limit we show that number of these
exceptions is nite for  6= 1 contrary to the  = 1 case where it was previously known that
it is innite. finally we also show independently of the string conjecture that number of all

8

solutions is (cid:16)n

2(cid:17) and which is required for completeness. the usual proofs of completeness

rely on string hypothesis. some preliminary numerical results have been presented also for
three particle sector. these results suggest that similar pattern observed in two particle
sector persists also for larger sectors.

of n .

figures

fig. 2. real parts of complex solutions for 1    1 and number of sites n = 40. empty
squares denote solutions of equation (2.7) (s-strings) and full circles denote solutions of equation
(2.8) (c-strings).

fig. 3. this gure shows dependence of real part of complex solutions on numbers of sites n
it clearly illustrates transmutation of one complex solution in real solution (two
for  = 0.95.
quasimomenta) for a given critical n . these two real quasimomenta correspond to same bethe
numbers and are obtained by numerical iteration of equations (2.1) and (2.2).

fig. 4. same as fig. 3 but for  = 1. we see that exceptional real solutions with same bethe

numbers which appear at some critical n persist for all n  ncrit..

fig. 5. number of missing strings is an integer part of real number n which is given as a

function of the coupling constant  for three dierent values of n .

fig. 6. all real solutions (triplets of quasimomenta) in m = 3 sector with at least two identical
bethe numbers are given for dierent number of sites and  = 1. they are obtained by numerical
iteration of bethe equations (1.7).

fig. 7. same as fig. 6 but for  = 0.95.
