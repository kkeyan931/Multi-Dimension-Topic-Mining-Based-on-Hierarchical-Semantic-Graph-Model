abstract

we study brane congurations corresponding to d-branes on complex three-
dimensional orbifolds c3/ with  = (3n2) and (6n2), nonabelian nite
subgroups of su(3). the brane congurations consist of d3-branes on webs
of (p, q) 5-branes of type iib string theory. the structure of irreducible repre-
sentations of the groups (3n2) and (6n2) can be explained from the brane
congurations. we also discuss relations between the brane congurations and
geometries of c3/ by means of toric methods.

1 introduction

d-branes at orbifold singularities have been intensively studied for recent years (see for
example [1]-[17]). one of the purposes is to investigate geometries of spacetime. d-branes
serve as tools to study ultrashort structure of spacetime. so it is interesting to study ge-
ometries probed by d-branes and compare them with geometries probed by point particles
or fundamental strings. orbifolds provide nontrivial but relatively simple examples for
such a purpose.

another motivation to study d-branes on orbifolds is to construct large families of
gauge theories. various choice of orbifolds leads to gauge theories with various supersym-
it is well-known that gauge theories can be constructed
metries in various dimensions.
by using brane congurations following the work of [18].
investigations from dierent
approaches and comparison between them are useful to clarify various aspects of gauge
theories. investigations along this line have been made in [19, 20, 12] for example.

to study d-brane gauge theories of orbifolds cd/, quiver diagrams play important
roles. quiver diagrams represent gauge groups and matter contents of the gauge theories.
they can be calculated with the aid of representation theory of the nite group , so they
also represent algebraic structure of the irreducible representations of . in addition, quiver
diagrams seem to include informations on geometries of orbifolds cd/. this is based
on what is called mckay correspondence (conjecture) [21, 22]. it states that there is a
relation between irreducible representations of a nite group  and (co)homology elements
of a space obtained by blowing up the singularity of cd/. mckay correspondence is
established for the cases d = 2 with   su(2) and d = 3 with  an abelian nite
subgroup of su(3). but it is conjectured that it holds for large class of models. if the
correspondence holds, the associated quiver diagram can be considered as a diagram which
represents some information on cohomology of a blown-up orbifold cd/.

d-branes on orbifolds cd/ were investigated for the case d = 2 with  a nite subgroup
of su(2) at rst [1, 2]. finite subgroups of su(2) are classied into ade series, and the
quiver diagrams coincide with the extended dynkin diagrams of the corresponding ade
lie algebra. as noted above, mckay correspondence holds for these cases and the dynkin
diagrams also represent geometric information such as intersections among cycles used to
blow up the singularity of c2/. for d-branes on orbifolds c3/ with  a nite abelian
subgroup of su(3), d-brane gauge theories were investigated with the aid of toric methods
[3]. mckay correspondence also holds for these cases. relations between quiver diagrams
and toric diagrams representing the geometry of the orbifold were discussed in [22].

in this paper, we study d-branes on three-dimensional nonabelian orbifolds c3/ with
  su(3). for these cases, the gauge theories have 1/8 supersymmetry compared with
type ii string theory. it is known that nite subgroups of su(3) are classied into ade-
like series [23]. that is, nite subgroups of su(3) other than su(2) and direct products
of abelian phase groups fall into 2 series:

 the analogues of dihedral subgroups of su(2) (d-type);

(3n2)
(6n2)

(n is a positive integer)
(n is a positive even integer)

 the analogues of exceptional subgroups of su(2) (e-type);

(60), (168), (360x), (36x), (72x), (216x)

(x = 1, 3)

here the number in braces is the order of the group. the quiver diagrams for  series
and  series were calculated in [16] and [14] respectively. in [16], it was found that the
quiver diagrams of the  series have a similar structure to a web of (p, q) branes of type
iib string theory [24, 25]. so it is natural to expect that the d-brane gauge theories can
be realized by brane congurations involving such a web of (p, q) branes. the purpose
of the present paper is to construct brane congurations corresponding to d-branes on
c3/. the key point of the construction is the observation that the quiver diagarm of
(3n2) ((6n2)) is obtained from that of zn  zn by making a certain identication. for
the orbifold c3/zn  zn, a brane realization is known as a brane box model [26, 12], an
important point of the brane box model is that each box of the conguration corresponds
to each irreducible representation of zn  zn. combining with the relation between the
quiver diagram of the group  and that of zn  zn, we construct a brane conguration for
c3/. it consists of d3-branes on a web of (p, q) 5-branes of type iib string theory with
a certain identication determined by the structure of quiver diagrams.

in [27], relations between brane congurations and toric varieties were pointed out. we
discuss brane congurations and geometries of the nonabelian orbifolds c3/ from this
viewpoint. although the nonabelian orbifolds c3/ are not toric varieties [15], we discuss
a possibility to analyze geometries of the nonabelian orbifolds in terms of toric methods
based on the brane congurations.

the organization of this paper is as follows.

in section 2, we review a prescription
to obtain worldvolume gauge theory of d-branes on an orbifold c3/. we also present
quiver diagrams for  = (3n2) and (6n2) calculated in [16].
in section 3, we rst
review the brane box model which is a realization of d-branes on an orbifold c3/zn  zn.
then we construct brane congurations for nonabelian orbifolds by taking into account the
relation between (3n2), (6n2) and zn  zn. we argue that the structure of irreducible
representations of (3n2) and (6n2) can be understood from the brane congurations.
in section 4, we discuss relations between brane congurations and toric diagrams. based
on the brane conguration for c3/, we propose quotients of toric diagrams to analyze
nonabelian orbifolds in terms of toric methods. section 5 is devoted to conclusions.

2 quiver diagrams for d-branes on nonabelian orb-

ifolds

in this section, we review the results of [16], in which the quiver diagrams for d-branes
on orbifolds c3/ with  = (3n2) and (6n2) were obtained. we start with n parallel
d1-branes on c3 where n = || is the order of . we will discuss the reason to take
d1-branes in sections 3 and 4. the eective action of the d-branes is given by the di-
mensional reduction of ten-dimensional u(n) super yang-mills theory to two-dimensions.
the bosonic eld contents are a u(n) gauge eld a and four complex adjoint scalars x 
( = 1, 2, 3) and y . fermionic eld contents are determined via unbroken supersymmetry,
so we do not touch upon them. we take  to act on complex three-dimensional space
corresponding to x . since y is irrelevant in the following discussions, we set y = 0.
next we project this theory onto  invariant space. the condition is expressed as

rreg(g)arreg(g)1 = a,
 rreg(g)x rreg(g)1 = x 

r3(g)

(2.1)
(2.2)

where g  , r3 is a three-dimensional representation of  which acts on spacetime indices
 and rreg is the n  n regular representation of  which acts on chan-paton indices. r3
denes how  acts on c3 to form the quotient singularity. the condition (2.1) implies that
gauge els surviving the projection are -invariant parts of rreg  r
reg. since the regular
representation rreg has the following decomposition

rreg = r

a=1nara, na = dimra

(2.3)

where ra denotes an irreducible representation of  and r is the number of irreducible
representations of , we obtain the following expression,

rreg  r

reg|inv = abna nbra  rb|inv

= ana na.

(2.4)

here we used schurs lemma. the equation means that the gauge symmetry of the resulting
theory is

r

if we consider n d-branes on the orbifold, the gauge group becomes

u(na).

y

a=1

r

y

a=1

u(nna).

4

(2.5)

(2.6)

one can see the matter contents after the projection (2.2) in a similar way. they are -
reg. by dening the tensor product of the three-dimensional

invariant parts of r3 rreg r
representation r3 and an irreducible representation ra as

r3  ra = r

b=1n3

abrb,

(2.7)

one obtains the following expression,

r3  rreg  r

reg|inv = abcn3
= abn3

abna ncrb  rc|inv
abna nb.

(2.8)
ab is the number of bifundamental elds which transform as na  nb under

it means that n3
u(na)  u(nb).

the gauge group and the spectrum are summarized in a quiver diagram. a quiver
diagram consists of r nodes corresponding to irreducible representations and arrows which
connect these nodes corresponding to bifundamental matters. outgoing arrows represent
fundamentals and ingoing arrows represent anti-fundamentals. n3
ab is the number of arrows
from the a-th node to the b-th node.

2.1 (3n2) case

the group (3n2) consists of the following elements

ai,j =




i
0
n
0 j

n
0 j
n

(2.9)
where n = e2i/n and 0  i, j < n. the n2 elements {ai,j} correspond to a three-
dimensional reducible representation of the abelian group zn  zn. the elements of the
group (3n2) are obtained by multiplying the the following matrices



1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

0 1 0
0 0 1
1 0 0

0 0 1

0 1 0













,




(2.10)

,

to the elements {ai,j}. the matrices (2.10) are the elements of the group z3, so the group
(3n2) is isomorphic to the semidirect product of zn  zn and z3.

we rst consider the cases with n / 3z. the irreducible representations of (3n2)
consists of one-dimensional representations and three-dimensional representations. there
are 3 one-dimensional representations which we denote as r
1 ( = 0, 1, 2). the three-
dimensional representations are labeled by two integers (m1, m2)  znzn with (m1, m2) 6=
(0, 0). furthermore there are equivalence relations among the representations r(m1,m2)

,

r(m1,m2)

 r(m1+m2,m1)

3

 r(m2,m1m2)

3

.

(2.11)

thus the three-dimensional representations are labeled by the lattice points (zn  zn 
(0, 0))/z3 where the action of z3 is dened by the relation (2.11). by counting the number
of the lattice points in (zn  zn  (0, 0))/z3 one can see that there are (n2  1)/3 three-
dimensional irreducible representations. thus the gauge group of the d-brane worldvolume
theory is u(1)3  u(3)(n2

1)/3.

now we take the three-dimensional representation acting on the spacetime indices as

r(m1,m2)

. by dening r(0,0)

3

as

r(0,0)

1  r1

1  r2

(2.12)

tensor products of r(m1,m2)
form,

3

and the irreducible representations are given by a compact

r(m1,m2)

3

 r(l1,l2)

3

= r(l1+m1,l2+m2)

3

 r(l1m2,l2+m1m2)

3

 r(l1m1+m2,l2m1)

3

.

(2.13)

although r(0,0)
is not an irreducible representation, the expression (2.13) is so simple that
we tentatively forget the structure (2.12) and treat it as if it is an irreducible representation.
as stated above, quiver diagrams consist of nodes associated with irreducible represen-
tations and arrows associated with matter contents. in the present case, the irreducible
representations are labeled by two integers modulo n, so we put the nodes on the lattice
points zn  zn. the equation (2.13) shows that there are three arrows which start from
(l1, l2). the end points are (l1+m1, l2+m2), (l1m1+m2, l2m1) and (l1m2, l2m1+m2).
the quiver diagram is obtained by putting such arrows to each node in zn  zn and identi-
fying the nodes according to the equivalence relations (2.11). the quiver diagram is shown
in figure 1. only one set of three arrows is depicted for simplicity although such a set
of arrows start from every node. due to the z3 identication, the fundamental region is
restricted to the parallelogram surrounded by dashed lines in figure 1. note that the node
at the origin lies at a xed point of the z3 action. this fact is related to the structure of
r(0,0)

in (2.12) as we will discuss in section 3.

for the cases with n  3z, there are 9 one-dimensional representations which we denote
as r
1 ( = 0, 1, . . . , 8) and three-dimensional representations labeled by (m1, m2)  znzn
with (m1, m2) 6= (0, 0), (n/3, 2n/3), (2n/3, n/3). as in the n / 3z cases, there are equiva-
lence relations (2.11). by counting the number of the lattice points in (zn zn (0, 0))/z3,
one can see that there are (n2/3  1) three-dimensional irreducible representations when
n/3 is an integer. so the gauge group of the d-brane theory is u(1)9  u(3)n2/31.

the quiver diagram is given in figure 2. it is essentially the same as in the n / 3z cases
except that the nodes (n/3, 2n/3) and (2n/3, n/3) lie at xed points of the z3 action.

2.2 (6n2) case

we now turn to the subgroup (6n2). the group (6n2) with n a positive integer consists
of {ai,j, ci,j, ei,j} in (2.9) and the following matrices.

(2.18)
as pointed out in [23], even if one choose n to be an odd integer, the matrices generate
elements of (6(2n)2) by multiplication. so we restrict the value of n to even integers.
the elements of the group (6n2) are obtained by multiplying the matrices (2.10) and

to the elements {ai,j} in (2.9). note that the six matrices (2.10) and (2.19) are the
elements of the permutation group s3 of order six. thus the group (6n2) is isomorphic
to the semidirect product of zn  zn and s3.

7

when n/3 is not an integer, the irreducible representations consist of 2 one-dimensional
representations, 1 two-dimensional representation, 2(n  1) three-dimensional represen-
tations and (n2  3n + 2)/6 six-dimensional representations. thus the gauge group is
u(1)2  u(2)  u(3)2(n1)  u(6)(n2
3n+2)/6. we denote the one-dimensional representa-
tions as rt
1 (t  z2), the two-dimensional representation as r2 and the three-dimensional
representations as r(m,m)t
, where m = 1, 2, . . . , n  1 and t takes values in z2. the
six-dimensional representations are labeled by (m1, m2)  zn  zn with (m1, m2) 6=
(n, n), (n, 0), (0, n). as in the (3n2) cases, there are relations among the representations
r(m1,m2)

so the six-dimensional representations are labeled by the lattice points (znzn(0, 0))/s3.
here s3 is the semidirect product of groups z3 and z2 whose action are dened by the
relations (2.20) and (2.21) respectively. (n2  3n + 2)/6 is the number of the lattice points
in (zn  zn  (0, 0))/s3 when n/3 is not an integer.

the quiver diagram is depicted in figure 3. due to the additional z2 identication of (2.21),
the fundamental region is restricted to, say, the lower triangle surrounded by dashed lines
in figure 3. we note that the nodes at (m, m) correspond to xed points of the z2 action
dened by (2.21). in addition, the node at the origin corresponds to a xed point of the
z3 action dened by (2.20).

when n/3 is an integer, the irreducible representations consist of 2 one-dimensional
representations, 4 two-dimensional representations, 2(n  1) three-dimensional represen-
tations and (n2  3n)/6 six-dimensional representations. so the gauge group is u(1)2 
u(2)4  u(3)2(n1)  u(6)(n2
3n)/6. we denote the two-dimensional representations as r
2
( = 0, . . . , 3) and use the same notations as the n / 3z case for other representations. as
in the n / 3z case, there are equivalence relations (2.20) and (2.21), so the six-dimensional
representations are labeled by the lattice points (zn  zn  (0, 0))/s3. (n2  3n)/6 is the
number of the lattice points in (zn  zn  (0, 0))/s3 when n/3 is an integer.

3 brane congurations for nonabelian orbifolds

in the last section, we have presented the quiver diagrams for d-branes on orbifolds c3/
with  = (3n2) and (6n2). unexpectedly the quiver diagrams have a resemblance to
the structure of string junctions [24] or webs of (p, q) 5-branes [25]. three (p, q) strings of
type iib theory are permitted to form a prong if the (p, q) charge is conserved,

likely that the gauge theory represented by the quiver diagram have something to do with
string junctions or a web of (p, q) 5-branes. in this section, we consider realizations of the
gauge theories of d-branes on the nonabelian orbifolds by using such brane congurations.
to investigate the brane congurations for nonabelian orbifolds c3/, we rst review
the brane box model which is a brane conguration corresponding to d-branes on an
abelian orbifold c3/zn  zn [26, 12]. as noted in the last section, the nite groups (3n2)
and (6n2) are closely related to zn  zn. we study the brane congurations for c3/
based on the brane box model by using relations between the groups  and zn  zn.

irreducible representations of the nite group zn zn consist of n2 one-dimensional rep-
n. we choose the three-dimensional representation

with (m1, m2)  z2

quiver diagram for the orbifold c3/(3n2) (c3/(6n2)) is essentially that for the orbifold
c3/zn  zn with the z3 equivalence relation (2.11) (the s3 equivalence relation (2.20) and
(2.21)).

the brane box is a model that provides the same gauge theory as the d-brane world-
it consists of the following set of branes; ns5-branes

volume theory on c3/zn  zn.

10

along 012345 directions, ns5-branes along 012367 directions and d5-branes along 012346
directions. the brane box conguration is shown in figure 6. it represents the brane con-
guration on 46-plane. in figure 6, the rst ns5(ns5)-brane and the (n+1)-th ns5(ns5)-
branes must be identied. the interest focusses on the gauge theory on the world-volume
of the d5-branes. being nite in 46 directions, the d5-branes are macroscopically (3+1)-
dimensional. each box provides a gauge group u(na) where na denotes the number of
d-branes on the a-th box. open strings connecting d-branes of neghbering boxes provide
matters. in the absence of ns5 and ns5-branes, two possible orientations are allowed for
the strings. the orientation of ns5 and ns5-branes induces a particular orientation for
the strings. one possible choice of orientations of strings is shown in figure 6 [26]. only
one set of three open strings is drawn although such a set of strings stretch from every box.
the oriented open strings stretching from d-branes at the a-th box to d-branes at the
b-th box provide bifundamental matters na  nb. thus the matter contents of the brane
box model are just what determined by the quiver diagram in figure 5. we make a list of
correspondence among representation theory, gauge theory, quiver diagram and brane box
model in table 1.

table 1: the correspondence among representation theory, gauge theory, quiver diagram
and brane box model.

the most important point of table 1 is that each box corresponds to each irreducible
representation of zn  zn. as we saw, the irreducible representations of the nonabelian
gruop (3n2) are the irreducible representations of zn  zn with the z3 identication
(2.11). thus a naive guess leads to the idea that the brane conguration for the orbifold
c3/(3n2) is the brane box conguration with the z3 identication. since z3 is not a
symmetry of the brane box conguration of figure 6, however, we can not divide the brane
box conguration by z3. instead, we construct a brane conguration which has the z3
symmetry maintaining the correspondence of table 1. global structure is determined by
the requirement that it gives appropriate gauge groups and matter contents as in table 1.
the requirement of the z3 symmetry leads to a condition on the local structure. naively it
leads to a prong which consists of three branes with directions (m1, m2), (m2, m1  m2)
and (m2  m1, m1) on a plane. however, the z3 equivalence relation (2.11) is dened
on the lattice of irreducible representations.
it means that the z3 action on the brane
conguration is dened in reference to the lattice of boxes. thus it is necessary to take

11

directions of alignment of boxes into account. there are innitely many possibilities which
satisfy these criterions. two examples are depicted in figure 7(a) and (b).

(a)

(b)

figure 7: two examples of brane congurations for c3/(3n2) with n = 4.

these gures represent brane congurations on the 56-plane. the lines indicate (p, q)
5-branes which extend along 01234 directions and p +  q direction in the 56-plane. here we
take  = i. the dierence between figure 7(a) and figure 7(b) is charges (p, q) of 5-branes.
three types of d-branes in figure 7(a) have (p, q) charges (2, 1), (1, 1) and (1, 2),
while three types of d-branes in figure 7(b) have (p, q) charges (1, 1), (1, 0) and (0, 1).
there are innitely many congurations with dierent charges. each hexagon plays the
role of each square of the brane box model. in contrast to the brane box model, however,
d-branes on each box must be d3-branes stretching along 0156 directions to maintain 1/8
supersymmetry. the conguration for the nonabelian orbifold c3/(3n2) is obtained by
identifying the rst row and the n-th row and the rst column and the n-th column and
furthermore by making the z3 identication. thus the fundamental region becomes the
small parallelogram bounded by dashed lines in figure 7.

since d3-branes are bounded by (p, q) 5-branes in 56-directions, their eective action
is two-dimensional. this is why we started with d1-branes on orbifolds. as in the brane
box model, each box gives a gauge group u(na) where na is the number of d-branes
on a-th box. matters come from open strings which connect d-branes on neighboring
boxes. the presence of (p, q) 5-branes induces a particular orientation for the strings.
relative orientations of strings are restricted by the requirement of the invariance under
the z3 action. there are two possibilities; one is shown in figure 7. the arrows indicate
the orientations of strings stretching from one box. again only one set of three open
strings is drawn although such a set of strings stretch from every box. these open strings
reproduce the matter contents determined by the quiver diagram in figure 1 for the case

12

3

3

= r(1,1)

r(m1,m2)
. another set of orientations is obtained by reversing the orientations of all
arrows, which is essentially equivalent to the case shown in figure 7. although we discussed
orientations of open strings by the requirement of the z3 invariance, it is necessary to nd
out a reason based on string theory that only such orientations are allowed.

to support our proposal for the brane congurations, we argue that the structure of
irreducible representations of the group (3n2) can be understood from the brane congu-
rations. first, we argue that all the lattice points of zn  zn correspond to representations
with the same dimensions. if the neighbouring boxes have dierent number of d-branes,
the (p, q) 5-brane between the two boxes bends along the directions transverse to the 56-
plane. then (p, q) 5-branes have extra intersections to each other. although we do not
nd out a reason to exclude such congurations, the eective theory of d-branes will be
quite dierent from that considered in this paper and they will be out of our scope. to
avoid such congurations, all boxes must have the same number of d-branes. this means
that all boxes give the same rank of gauge groups, so all the lattice points correspond to
representations with the same dimensions.

secondly, we argue that the dimensions of the representations are three. as one can
see from the equivalence relations (2.11), the origin corresponds to a xed point of the z3
action. so one must take the z3 quotient for the box at the origin. the action of z3 on the
56-plane is dened by the relations (2.11). as noted earlier, we must determine the action
of z3 on chan-paton indices. the group z3 originates from the relation (3n2)/zn  zn 
z3. as noted in the last section, the elements (3n2) are obtained by acting z3 to the
elements of zn  zn. it implies that the z3 acts as a regular representation on chan-paton
indices. then the number of d-branes must be three since the dimension of the regular
representation of z3 is three. combining with the discussion on bending of (p, q) 5-branes,
it leads to the consequence that all boxes have three d-branes. therefore all lattice points
correspond to representations with dimension three.

thirdly, we discuss that only the origin corresponds to a sum of 3 one-dimensional
representations. by the same argument given in section 2, one can see that the orbifold
projection on the box at the origin reduces the gauge group from u(3) to u(1)3 this
fact can be explained from string theory point of view. since z3 acts on the chan-paton
indices as a regular representation, the orbifolding procedure makes the three d-branes at
the origin to one spiral d-brane surrounding the xed point of z3 as shown in figure 8.
then an oriented open string stretching from i-th d-brane to j-th d-brane is the same as
an open string stretching from (i + 1)-th d-brane to (j + 1)-th d-brane (modulo 3). the
(i, j) component of the gauge eld comes from the oriented open string from i-th d-brane to
j-th d-brane, thus the nine components of the gauge eld are reduced to three components
corresponding to the gauge group u(1)3. therefore the three-dimensional representation
at the origin is reduced to 3 one-dimensional representations.

to sum up, all the lattice points of zn  zn except the origin correspond to three-
dimensional irreducible representations and the origin corresponds to a sum of 3 one-

13

figure 8: the d-brane on the box at the origin.

dimensional representations. this is the structure of the irreducible representations of the
group (3n2) with n / 3z.

as for the case (3n2) with n  3z, there are three lattice points (0, 0), (n/3, 2n/3)
and (2n/3, n/3) invariant under z3. by the same argument as the n / 3z cases, these
three points correspond to sums of 3 one-dimensional representations in accordance with
the denitions (2.14) - (2.16). thus the structure of the irreducible representations of
(3n2) is explained from the brane congurations. the brane conguration for the orbifold
c3/(6n2) is obtained by making z2 identication (m1, m2)  (m2, m1) in addition to the
z3 identication for c3/(3n2). in these cases, the origin is a xed point of the z3 action
dened by (2.20) and the z2 action dened by (2.21). so we must take both quotients
z3 and z2 for the box at the origin. since the group generated by these actions are the
permutation group s3 of order six, we must put six d-branes to every box by the same
argument as the c3/(3n2) cases. from representation theory of nite groups, one can
directly see that the irreducible representations of s3, which is a nonabelian group of order
six, consist of 2 one-dimensional representations and 1 two-dimensional representation.
thus the gauge group coming from the box at the origin is reduced from u(6) to u(1)2 
u(2). as the lattice point (m, m) with m 6= 0 is a xed point of z2, the gauge group
u(6) is reduced to u(3)2. for the n  3z cases, there is an additional z3 xed point
(2n/3, n/3). the gauge group corresponding to this point is reduced from u(6) to u(2)3.
thus the structure of irreducible representations of the group (6n2) can be obtained from
the brane congurations.

4 brane congurations and toric diagrams

in this section, we discuss relations between the brane congurations and geometries of the
nonabelian orbifolds c3/ by using toric methods. we consider orbifolds without d-branes
for a whole and incorporate d-branes later. relations between toric diagrams and brane
congurations were discussed in [27]. the basic idea is as follows. a complex d-dimensional

14

toric variety involves real d-dimensional torus t d. certain cycles of the torus t d shrink
on some loci of the toric variety. a toric variety is determined by specifying which cycles
shrink where. such an information is represented by a diagram in real d-dimensional space,
which we call a toric diagram. informations on cohomology of the toric variety is encoded
in the toric diagram. for toric varieties with vanishing rst chern class, toric diagrams
are reduced to those in (d  1)-dimensional space. as we are considering complex three-
dimensional toric varieties with vanishing rst chern class, their toric diagrams represent
how a torus t 2 of the toric variety shrinks. more precisely, what is identied with loci
where t 2 shrinks is a dual diagram of the toric diagram. a line in the dual diagram with
a slope q/p represents locus at which a (p, q) cycle of t 2 shrinks. on the other hand, it is
known that m-theory on t 2 is dual to type iib string theory on a circle s1 [28]. vanishing
(p, q) cycles of t 2 of m-theory corresponds to (p, q) 5-branes of type iib string theory.
if we consider m-theory on a toric variety and dualize in this sense along the 2-torus t 2
of the toric variety, we obtain type iib string theory on a circle with (p, q) 5-branes; the
skelton of the dual diagram is identied with a web of (p, q) 5-branes.

now we would like to discuss brane congurations for the nonabelian orbifolds c3/
based on this argument. since the orbifolds c3/ are not toric varieties, however, we
can not directly apply the above argument. so we rst consider a brane conguration for
c3/zn  zn, which is a toric variety. then combining with the discussion in section 3 on
relations between the brane congurations for c3/zn  zn and those for c3/, we discuss
geometries of the orbifolds c3/.

the toric diagram of a crepant resolution of the orbifold c3/zn  zn is depicted in
figure 9. its dual diagram depicted in figure 10 represents a web of (p, q) 5-branes in
the sense described above. however, the models discussed in section 3 are elliptic models;

figure 9: the toric diagram for
a resolution of c3/zn  zn with
n = 4.

figure 10: the dual diagram to
figure 9.

they are compactied along 56 directions to t 2. to compactify the two directions to t 2,

15

we must impose periodicity conditions along these directions. it is realized by duplicating
the conguration of figure 10 and making appropriate identications as depicted in figure
11. it seems to imply that only one orbifold singularity of c3/zn  zn can not lie on such

figure 11: the brane conguration for elliptic c3/zn  zn. parallel dashed lines must be
identied.

a compact space. it is necessary to justify the duplication from toric geometry point of
view. by applying the discussion that the brane conguration for c3/(3n2) is that for
c3/zn  zn with z3 identication, we obtain the conguration of figure 7(b) proposed in
section 3 as a brane conguration for c3/(3n2).

here we discuss the geometry of c3/(3n2) based on the brane conguration of figure
7(b). if we naively apply the relation between brane congurations and toric diagrams, we
are led to a speculation that the toric diagram for c3/(3n2) is given by taking the z3
quotient to the toric diagram for c3/zn  zn as depicted in figure 12. as one can see from

figure 12: the z3 quotient of the toric diagram for c3/zn  zn.

the fact that the orbifold c3/ is not a toric variety, the quotient of the toric diagram is
not a toric diagram. however, we need a new formulation to analyze non-toric varieties in

16

any case1. in this respect, it is likely that quotients of toric diagrams provide us a tool to
analyze non-toric varieties such as the nonabelian orbifolds in terms of toric methods. it
would be interesting to seek for a possibility to formulate quotients of toric diagrams. we
should also notice that the z3 action determined from representation theory coincides with
the z3 symmetry the toric diagram of c3/znzn originally has although there is no a priori
reason. it is in favor of the above discussion and the mckay correspondence conjecture
which states that there is a relation between irreducible representations of (3n2) and
cohomology elements of a minimal resolution of c3/(3n2).

now we comment on the dierence between the brane conguration of figure 7(a) and
that of figure 7(b). they are only dierent in (p, q) charges of 5-branes. from the toric
geometry point of view, however, there is an essential dierence [25]. the toric diagram
corresponding to the conguration of figure 7(a) before z3 identication is depicted of
figure 13(a). in the gure, there is a lattice point in each triangle in contrast to figure
9. it means that the orbifold singularity is not fully resolved. to resolve fully the orb-
ifold singularity, we must subdivide the toric diagram as shown in figure 13(b). then
each junction of (p, q) 5-branes is replaced by figure 13(c). this kind of conguration is
considered in [29] in the context of brane box models.

so far we have considered m-theory on orbifolds. now we would like to make a rough
argument to relate them to type iib string theory discussed in the previous sections incor-
porating d-branes. we start with type iib string theory with a web of (p, q) 5-branes along
01234 directions and one direction of the 56 plane and d3-branes along 0156 directions.
we rst t-dualize along direction 9 and decompactify along direction 10. then we ob-
tain m-theory on an orbifold c3/(3n2) with m5-branes along 01569(10) directions. here

1such an attempt was also made in [15].

17

c3/(3n2) extends to 56789(10) directions. to obtain type iib string theory on orbifolds,
we take a limit that one of the direction 1 shrinks. then we obtain type iia string theory on
the orbifold with d4-branes along 0569(10). next we take t-dualities along 256 directions.
then we obtain type iib string theory on the orbifold. thus type iib string theory with
the web of (p, q) 5-branes are related to type iib string theory on the orbifold c3/(3n2)
via m-theory on the orbifold. however the d4-branes become d3-branes along 029(10)
directions by these dualities. therefore the right interpretation of the d1-branes discussed
in section 2 seems to be d3-branes wrapped around two directions 9(10) of the orbifold.
wrapped d-branes on some cycles of orbifolds stick to the singularity in general [30, 31].
however, a set of wrapped d-branes may be allowed to move away from the singularity
due to some homology relations of c3/(3n2) [12]. to know the properties of wrapped
d-branes, it is necessary to know geometries of c3/(3n2). we leave investigations on
such branes for future work.

we have considered the congurations for c3/(3n2) with n / 3z. the other cases
can be treated almost in the same way, so we do not describe these cases except for one
comment. the toric diagram for c3/(6n2) is obtained by taking z2 quotient to that
of c3/zn  zn in addition to the z3 quotient. the z2 is not a symmetry of the toric
diagram of c3/zn  zn itself in figure 9 but a symmetry of the diagram corresponding to
the elliptic model obtained by duplicating the toric diagram of figure 9.

5 conclusions

in this paper, we have studied brane congurations corresponding to d-branes on non-
abelian orbifolds c3/ with  = (3n2) and (6n2). the essential observation is that the
quiver diagram of (3n2) ((6n2)) is equivalent to that of zn  zn with an additional z3
(s3) identication. by using the brane box model, which is a realization of d-branes on
c3/zn  zn, as guideline, we have proposed brane congurations for c3/.

the conguration for c3/(3n2) (c3/(6n2)) is obtained by making a z3 (s3) iden-
tication on a web of (p, q) 5-branes with d3-branes. we have shown that the structure
of the irreducible representations of (3n2) and (6n2) can be explained via the brane
congurations. we have also discuss the brane congurations from toric geometry point of
view. based on the argument which relates branes and toric geometry, we have proposed
quotients of toric diagrams to study geometries of nonabelian orbifolds. it is known that a
toric variety can be realized as a vacuum moduli space of a two-dimensional gauged linear
sigma model [32]. in this formulation, quotients seem to be realized by imposing nontrivial
relations among charges of chiral superelds of the model. it would be interesting to study
a possibility to formulate quotients of toric diagrams from this viewpoint. if such an at-
tempt works well, moduli space of d-brane gauge theory may be investigated by using toric
techniques. we also hope that the idea to take quotients of toric diagrams will provide

18

insight into mckay correspondence for nonabelian nite subgroups of su(3).

it is also interesting to generalize the work to other cases. for the e-type subgroups of
su(3), a catalogue of quiver diagrams is given in [14]. it is so complicated that construction
of brane congurations seems to be dicult. however, unbroken supersymmetry may
provide us a guide to the construction. for   su(4), classication of nite subgroups
were summarized in [33]. since there is no supersymmetry in these cases, quiver diagrams
representing bosonic matter contents and those representing fermionic matter contents are
dierent. it would be interesting to nd a mechanism to provide such asymmetric matter
contents from brane congurations.
