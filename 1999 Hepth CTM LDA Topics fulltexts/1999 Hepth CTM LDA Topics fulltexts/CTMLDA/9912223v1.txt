abstract. the casimir energy of a dilute dielectric cylinder, with the same light-velocity

(where

1 + 2(cid:19)2
as in its surrounding medium, is evaluated exactly to rst order in 2 = (cid:18)1  2

1, 2 are the dielectric constants of the cylinder and of its environment), and numerically to
higher orders in 2. the rst part is carried out using addition formulas for bessel functions,

and no debye expansions are required.

1 introduction

zero-point uctuations of quantum elds give rise to forces, which are regarded as manifes-

tations of the casimir eect (for reviews, see e.g. refs.[1]). from the theoretical viewpoint,

one of the most daunting aspects of the evaluation of casimir energies, even for highly sym-

metrical boundaries, is its sheer diculty. many mathematical methods has been developed,

but even the simplest ones demand considerable eorts.

at the core of several of these techniques one nds uniform asymptotic expansions

also called debye expansions of bessel or ricatti-bessel functions appearing in integrals

over momentum-like variables. this fruitful method was used as early as at least the

time of ref.[2], and has been repeatedly revisited in a huge number of articles, often in

the framework of other regularization schemes (see e.g. ref.[3] and refs. therein). however

reliable, the whole debye expansion technique is a time-consuming process and the search for

computational alternatives might be of interest [4]. this is, precisely, one of the motivations

of the present letter. our purpose is to take further the exploitation of summation theorems

for bessel functions, started in ref.

[4] for cases with spherical surfaces, and apply it to a

problem with a cylindrical boundary.

we are considering a material cylinder of radius a, innitely long, placed along the z-

axis, with permitivitty and permeability 1, 1, surrounded by a medium with permitivitty

and permeability 2, 2. for such surfaces, a special situation is the case where the light

velocities in both media interior (1) and exterior (2) are the same, i.e.,

11 = 22  c2,

(1)

where c is the common light-velocity. since any variation in  aects , this is called

dielectric-diamagnetic case, as opposed to the purely dielectric one, in which 1 = 2 = 1

but the velocity has to change. dielectric-diamagnetic conditions are often desirable as they

cause the frequency equations to simplify and some divergences to cancel out. in a qcd

context,  and  refer to colour permitivitty and permeability (see [5] and refs. therein).

illustrations of the dependence of the interquark potential on the boundary conditions for a

string model have been provided in ref.[6].

in refs.

[7], [8] and [9] the regularized casimir energy per lateral unit-length for an

innite dielectric-diamagnetic cylinder has been studied. up to the order of

1 + 2(cid:19)2
2 = (cid:18)1  2

,

(2)

the energy has been shown to vanish within all the tested degrees of numerical accuracy.

the next contribution, which is of the order of 4, has been found to our knowledge, for

the rst time in ref.[9].

in our minds, medium 2 will be pure vacuum and medium 1 a very tenuous dielectric,
which means 2 = 2 = 1 and 1  1  1. as a result, the 2 parameter, dened by
eq.(2), is a small number. according to ref.[7], the eigenfrequencies  coming from the

maxwell equations for this problem are given by the zeros of some equations of the type
fn(kz, , a) = 0, n  z eqs.(2.3)-(2.5) in ref.[7]. further, in cases where the relation (1)
holds, fn takes the form

fn(kz, , a) = a2c26 (1 + 2)2

n,m,kz = cq2

(5)

the n-index is the angular momentum number, while m describes the remaining degree of

freedom, i.e., labels the dierent -values at a given n.

the present work is organized as follows. in sec. 2 we follow ref. [7] and evaluate the

energy density g(2) (in momentum space) up to the order of 2, by a modied bessel function

summation theorem, and resorting to the properties of meijer g functions. then, we show

that the integration of g(2) yields a vanishing result. sec. 3 is devoted to an alternative

approach based on a zeta function prescription for the initial mode sum like in refs.[3, 10].

apart from proving to be easier, this technique paves the way to the numerical calculation

of higher order contributions. our conclusions are given in sec. 4.

2 density method

we begin by reviewing the procedure used in ref.

[7] and obtaining an expression for the

casimir energy. the mode sum is rst represented, as usual in these cases, by a contour

integral

ec = 

hc

xn=

(6)

where the integration contour c consists of a straight line parallel to, and just to the right
of, the imaginary axis, (i, +i) closed by a semicircle of an innitely large radius in the
right half-plane. the branch line of the function () = q2 + k2
z is chosen to run between
i|kz| and i|kz| on the imaginary axis. in terms of y = im  we have

iqy2  k2
z,
qk2
z  y2,
iqy2  k2
z ,

y > kz,
|y| < kz,
y < kz.

(iy) =



dkzz 

noting that the argument of the logarithm is an even function of iy, (6) reduces to

ec =

xn=z

kz qy2  k2

z dy lnh1  2(yy(in(ay)kn(ay)))2i ,

(7)

(8)

where we have expressed (3) explicitly on the imaginary axis. integrating with respect to kz
we obtain the casimir energy per unit length (ec) as an integral over y, namely

ec =

hc
4



xn=z 

0

dy y2y lnh1  2(yy(in(ay)kn(ay)))2i .

(9)

in the following subsections, we use the approach of ref. [4] to evaluate this expression.

2.1 density calculation to the order of 2

having integrated kz out, the integrand in expression (9) may be interpreted as the density

of casimir energy with respect to the parameter y = i. this density may be evaluated by

expanding in terms of 2, the rst contribution being

g(2)(y) 

hc2
4



xn=

dy y2y[yy(in(ay)kn(ay))]2.

(10)

we shall now show that g(2) can be calculated explicitly by a variant of the method shown
in ref. [4]. specifying the identity 8.530.2 of ref. [11] to hankel solutions zn = h (1)
n  hn,

and choosing the  parameter equal to zero, we obtain the summation theorem

h0(m r(, r, )) =



xn=

jn(m) hn(mr) ein, r(, r, )  q2 + r2  2r cos .

(11)

performing the change m  im, and selecting the special case  = r, it becomes
k0(m r(r, )) =

in(mr) kn(mr) ein, r(r, )  rq2(1  cos ) = 2r |sin (/2)| .



xn=

dierentiating with respect to m, using the property k 

that kn = kn, and setting m = 1 afterwards, we have

(12)
0(z) = k1(z) together with the fact

 r(r, ) k1(r(r, )) =



xn=

r (in kn)(r) ein.

recalling the orthogonality of the imaginary exponential functions, we arrive at

1

2 z 2

0

d [r(r, ) k1(r(r, ))]2 =



xn=

[r(in kn)(r)]2  f (r),

(13)

(14)

in order to proceed, we rename r into ay, and do the variable change u  |sin (/2)|. after
dierentiation with respect to y, we realize that the sum in (10) is given by

g(2)(y) =

thus, we have turned the problem of calculating an innite angular-momentum summation

into the evaluation of a denite integral of a transcendental function. next, by writing the

product of bessel functions appearing in eq.(15) in terms of the meijer g function [12], g(2)

can be evaluated explicitly. (see appendix for the denition and some simple properties of

this function.) first, we write

; 0, 1, 2; 4a2y2u2(cid:19)

(16)

where, in the last step, we have made use of the identity (48). dierentiating (16) with

respect to y and substituting in (15) we obtain

g(2)(y) =

2.2 calculation of the energy to order 2.

(17)

(18)

we now turn to the question of deriving the casimir energy. there are two possibilities:

1. to perform the u integration in (15) after integrating over the y variable. unfortunately,

this turns out to be divergent. considering the integral

2

2 z 

0



2

y2dy z

du y[y sin uk1(2y sin u)]2

and interchanging the order of integration, one arrives at

z 

0

dy y2y [y sin u k1(2y sin u)]2 =

1

12 sin2 u

.

(19)

(20)

if we now try to do the u-integration, the integral diverges. this shows that some further

regularization is called for. in fact, in sec. 3 we will go through the same sort of calculation,

but with the advantage of having applied zeta function regularization from the outset.

2. direct integration of g(2)(y). we use the following identity from ref.

[12] (vol 1, page

215).

in order to take advantage of this formula, we note that k 1

variable t = r

and inserting k 1

(22)

although we have inserted k 1

2

, as a mere technicality to help calculate the energy, one can

think of using it as an exponential regulator3 (see ref.[4]). however the convergence of the

integral shows that the density we have derived is already regularized in some sense. one

can now use (21) to get:

(23)

in order to check the asymptotics as r  0, we use the property (49), together with the
asymptotics (again from ref.[12]) g(x) = o(|x|) as x  0, for p  q, and  = max{re bh}
for h = 1, . . . , m. in our case we simply have

ec

(2)  lim

r0

ro(|2

r|) = lim

r0o(r) = 0.

(24)

thus, the 2-term is shown to vanish, conrming the conclusions of refs.

[7], [8] and [9],

without recourse to numerical evaluations.

3 complete zeta function regularization

in this section we will take a dierent approach, based on the application of the complete

zeta function method (see e.g. refs.[3, 10]) to the initial mode sum (5). the use of zeta

functions for regularizing such sort of sums dates from the time of refs.[13]. in the version

we shall now apply, the regularized value of the casimir energy per unit-length is

ec = lim

s1

1
2

hc (d=3)(s)

(25)

where the zeta function (d=3) for the whole set of -modes in the three-dimensional problem

say  is given by

(d=3)(s) = xn,m z 



dkz

2 (cid:18)n,m,kz

c

(cid:19)s

.

(26)

3actually, it is not dicult to show that applying an exponential regulator in the form er  to (6),

before carrying the kz integration, yields the same result as the one we derive.

6

first, one assumes that s is large enough for this function to make sense, with the nal aim
of setting s = 1 at the end (usually, one introduces in (25) an arbitrary mass scale, but, in
this problem, it turns out to be unnecessary). taking into account (5), we write

(d=3)(s) = xn,m z

lets consider the zeta function for the projected two-dimensional problem,i.e., for the 

eigenmode set:

(d=2)() = xn,m


n,m =

where n() stands for the nth partial-wave zeta function

bearing this in mind, we put (27) as

n() =


n,m.

(d=2)(2) + o(s + 1)# ,

(30)
where an expansion around s = 1 has taken place. this was the method applied in ref.[10].
eqs. (28), (29) hold for re  > 1, but they will have to be analytically continued to
the neighbourhood of  = 2 (note that  = s 1). such an analytic continuation is carried
out by the contour integration method of refs.[14, 3]. to begin with, one takes

a n() =



2i zc

du u1 ln [fn(u)] , for re  > 1 ,

(31)

where fn(u)  fn(kz, , a) with u  a, and c is a circuit in the complex u-plane enclosing
all the positive zeros of fn(u). in the desired limit this contour will be semicircular, with

the straight parts along the imaginary axis, and adequately avoiding the origin. the rst
step (see e.g.[14]) is to examine the asymptotic behaviour fn,as(u) of fn(u) for |u|  . if
fn,as(u) has no roots inside of c, we leave the eq.(31) unchanged by setting

a n() =



2i zc

du u1 ln" fn(u)

fn,as(u)# .

(32)

7

going back to (3), we observe that, for large x, p 2

n(x) = o (x4). then, one can write

fn(u) = fn,as(u) "1 + 2 2u2
4 p 2

n(u)# ,

fn,as(u) = 

(1 + 2)2

therefore, eq.(32) translates into

an() =

4

n(u)# .

(33)

(34)

after realizing that only the vertical parts of c where u = ei/2y are actually con-

tributing to the integration, eq.(34) yields

n() = a 


sin(cid:18)
where we have used p 2
, being in, kn the corresponding modied
bessel functions (note that this y is dimensionless). all this has validity near  = 1, but
we still need some further work in order to reach the neighbourhood of  = 2.

note that we are commuting a -expansion with a process of analytic extension which

sidesteps -poles (i.e., s-poles). yet, since the -dependence has no problematic traits,

this should be correct, and we write

where we have also taken into account (28) and the fact that n() = n(). an integral

representation of the f (y) is already available in eq.(14). from there, we proceed as in the
derivation of eq.(15), i.e., we do the variable change u  | sin(/2)| and nd

the y-integration is evaluated with the help of formula 6.576.4 in ref.[11]. then, the remain-

(41)

which has a zero of order one at  = 2 by virtue of the singularity of (cid:16) +2

which provides the desired analytic extension to re  = 2. the crucial point is that it has
a zero of order two at  = 2 and, therefore,  (2)
(2) = 0 . this,
together with eqs. (25) and (30), leads to ec = 0 + o (4), i.e.,

(d=2)(2) = 0 and  (2)

which was numerically found in ref.[7] 4 (see also [8, 9]).

3.2 higher-order corrections in 2

in order to know new corrections in 2, one has to keep the next 2-terms in eqs. (36), (37).
() integrals with p  2 are already nite at  = 2,
(2y)2p as y  . thus, the restriction to re  > 1 in (36) is

(44)

a posteriori, we have veried that each term decreases quickly enough with n and that the

(d=2)(2) = 0, and the 2p-contributions to ec are

(46)

in agreement with ref.

[9]. as remarked there, the negative sign means that the involved

casimir forces are attractive. physical implications concerning the ux tube model for

connement have been discussed in that work.

in fact, the higher p, the fewer terms are needed in the n-series for obtaining reliable

gures. for p > 2 we have found many contributions, but we just list the rst ones:

. . .

. . .

as argued in refs.[7] or [8], the special value 2 = 1 should reproduce the perfectly-
conducting case ec (p.c.) a2/(hc) = 0.01356 . . . [16, 10]. taking all the contributions up to
p = 7, we obtain ec a2/(hc)  0.01224, with a 10% relative error. this is not too surprising,
as the 2-expansion comes from a logarithimc series, and a slow numerical convergence at
2 = 1 is expectable. including all the terms up to p = 200 we have found ec a2/(hc) 
0.01354, with a 0.15% relative error.

4 conclusions

the ultimate consequences of any result about casimir eect are not easy to foresee, as the

domain of applicability of this concept has been expanding beyond what could be considered

10

traditional areas of eld theory. for instance, we have recent examples of these ideas in

spacetime evolution and quantum cosmology [17]. proposals haven even been made about

possible ways of extracting work from the vacuum energy [18].

in the present letter we have conrmed the expectation that the 2-contribution to

the casimir energy for a dilute-dielectric cylinder, innitely long, and under the condition

of light-velocity conservation, would have to vanish. numerically speaking, this had been

noticed with very high accuracy in several articles, starting with ref.[7], but in the present

letter we have been able to derive it as an exact result (eqs.(24) and (43)). another new

aspect lies in applying the method developed in [4], i.e., the use of summation theorems for

innite series of bessel functions, which has spared us the handling of debye expansions (see

also the application of this method in ref.[19] and [20], but this time in connection with the

problem of refs.[21]).

moreover, by a numerical evaluation, and within the complete zeta function regu-

larization framework, we have reobtained the 4-contribution calculated in ref.[9], (our eq.

(46)), which is negative. this constitutes the rst deviation from zero and shows that,

although at a higher order, the casimir energy of this system would tend to contract the

cylinder. even higher corrections in 2 have also been found (table in sec. 3).

our spectral zeta function has been constructed like in ref.[10]. other variants of

the zeta function procedure, which dier from ours at some particular steps, are also in

circulation (e.g. ref.[15] or [8]). we regard them as slightly dierent formulations of one

common underlying principle.

in particular, ref.[15] illustrates the advantages of dealing

with the total zeta function as a whole object, rather than a series of partial-wave zeta

functions.

a appendix: the meijer g function

here we state some facts about the meijer g function, which is dened by the integral

gmn

pq (alist, blist, x) =

1

2i zl

j=1 (bj  s)qn
ds qm
qq
j=m+1 (1  bj + s)qp

j=1 (1  aj + s)

j=n+1 (aj  s)

xs.

(47)

the dierent integration paths l can be found, for example, in [12], as most of the other

properties we use. by simple variable changes one may prove numerous identities such as:

xngmn

pq (alist, blist, x) = gmn

pq (alist + n, blist + n, x)

(48)

11

and

gmn

pq (alist, blist,

1
x

) = gmn

qp (1  blist, 1  alist, x)

(49)

which we have used in secs. 2.1, 2.2.
