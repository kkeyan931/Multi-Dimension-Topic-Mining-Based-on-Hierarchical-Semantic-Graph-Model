abstract

we embed the seibergwitten solution for the low energy dynamics of n = 2 super
yangmills theory with an even number of massive hypermultiplets into the whitham hi-
erarchy. expressions for the rst and second derivatives of the prepotential in terms of the
riemann theta function are provided which extend previous results obtained by gorsky,
marshakov, mironov and morozov. checks in favour of the new equations involve both
their behaviour under duality transformations and the consistency of their semiclassical
expansions.

1 introduction

soon after the paper of seiberg and witten [1] appeared, the coincidence between spectral
curves of soliton equations of the toda type and the seibergwitten hyperelliptic curves
for the low energy eective action of n = 2 susy yangmills was established [2, 3].
the averaged dynamics of these integrable systems, that goes under the generic name of
whitham hierarchy [4], allows for an interpretation of the eective prepotential as the
logarithm of a quasiclassical tau function [5, 6]. later on, some non-perturbative results
concerning the derivatives of the prepotential as functions over the moduli space [7, 8]
were rephrased neatly in this language [9, 10]. however, it was not until very recently
that the richness of this approach showed its true thrust. the role of the whitham times
as wilsonian couplings, or infrared counterpart of microscopic deformations by higher
polynomial interactions, was well settled in the context of two-dimensional topological
conformal eld theory and the kontsevich model [11]. in four dimensions, this conjectured
link was put on a rm basis thanks to the work carried out by gorsky, marshakov, mironov
and morozov [12], where rst and second derivatives of the prepotential with respect to
these times were computed as functions over the moduli space. the appearance of a
logarithmic derivative of the riemann theta function conrmed and extended analogous
formulas for the contact terms in topological n = 2 twisted theory obtained from the
so-called u-plane integral [13, 14, 15, 16]. in ref.[17], the analytical results of [12] were
put to work. a rst calculational goal was an ecient algorithm for recursive evaluation
of the semiclassical expansion of the prepotential. also, the relation between whitham
parameters and microscopic deformations of pure su(n) was analysed (see also [18]) and,
nally, the whitham times were seen to provide generalized spurionic sources for breaking
supersymmetry softly down to n = 0. in [19], this formalism was used to extract (or test)
non trivial strong coupling information that is dicult to obtain from other methods as,
for example, the o-diagonal couplings at the maximal singularities of the moduli space.
for a review on the latest developments in these subjects, see refs.[18, 20].

in the present paper, we shall extend this formalism to the case of n = 2 supersymmet-
ric yangmills theory with any classical gauge group and massive matter hypermultiplets
in the fundamental representation. as it is well known, the seibergwitten ansatz also
holds in this situation and one still has a geometrical picture in terms of an auxiliary
punctured riemann surface . also, the connection with integrable models has been ob-
served in this case [10, 21]. the masses of the hypermultiplets are (linearly related to) the
residues of the seibergwitten dierential at the poles. from the point of view of the the-
ory of riemann surfaces (and of the whitham hierarchy), this implies the incorporation

1

to the game of dierentials with simple poles on  (third kind meromorphic dierentials).
the paper is organized as follows. we start, in section 2, by reviewing the construction
of the universal whitham hierarchy along the lines of refs.[4, 6]. in section 3, we partic-
ularize this setup to the case of interest by introducing the seibergwitten hyperelliptic
curve. section 4 is devoted to the construction of the generating meromorphic dierential
implied by the whitham hierarchy, in such a way that the seibergwitten dierential
naturally ts into the framework.

in section 5, general formulas for the rst and second derivatives of the prepotential
are obtained within this enlarged framework. they usually involve the riemann theta
function and extend the pure gauge results of ref.[12]. in section 6, we obtain the whole
set of duality transformations of the previously computed couplings by analyzing their
behaviour under symplectic transformations of the homology basis and deformations of
integration contours. of course, the particular whitham hierarchy we are considering is
strongly motivated by the seibergwitten solution for the eective n = 2 super yang
mills theory with massive hypermultiplets whose moduli space, ultimately, should be
recovered as a submanifold. this is done in section 7, where we end up by giving several
formulas for the rst and second order derivatives of the eective prepotential of n = 2
supersymmetric gauge theories. in section 8, we give two types of arguments supporting
the expressions found in this way. first, we show that these expressions exhibit the re-
quired duality covariance. second, we see by explicit computation that they are consistent
in a highly non-trivial way with the semiclassical expansion of the prepotential. in fact,
following the same lines of ref.[17], one can use this formalism to develop a recursive
procedure to obtain the instanton expansion of the eective prepotential up to arbitrary
order [22]. we extend our results to any classical gauge group in section 9. finally, in
the last section, we include some further remarks and present some avenues for future
research.

2 whitham equations and the prepotential

it is well known from the general theory of riemann surfaces that there are three basic
types of abelian dierentials. they can be characterized by their laurent expansion
about selected points called punctures. let p or q denote two such points on a riemann
surface  of genus g, with local coordinates p and q about them.

(i) holomorphic dierentials, di.

in any open set u  , with complex coordinate
, they are of the form d = f ()d with f an holomorphic function. the vector

2

space of holomorphic dierentials has complex dimension g. if the complex curve is
hyperelliptic,

y2 =

2(g+1)yi=1

dvk =

gkd

y

(  ei) ,

(2.1)

a suitable basis for these dierentials is given by the following set of g holomorphic
1-forms

,

k = 1, 2, ...g .

(2.2)

given a symplectic basis of homology cycles ai, bi  h1(, z) one may compute
their period integrals

ai

k =iai

dvk

bik =ibi

dvk .

a canonical basis {dj} can be dened by the g linear equations

(2.3)

(2.4)

dj = i

j ,

iai

ibi

and clearly both bases are related as dj = a1k
yield moduli of the curve 2

jdvk. now the matrix of biperiods

dj = ij .

(2.5)

(ii) meromorphic dierentials of the second kind, dp

order n + 1 at point p  , and zero residue.
(p (p ) = 0), the normalization

n . these have a single pole of
in local coordinates p about p ,

dp

n = (n1

p

+ o(1)) dp ,

(2.6)

determines dp
n up to an arbitrary combination of holomorphic dierentials di. to
x the regular part we shall require that it has vanishing aiperiods. altogether,
dp

n is uniquely dened by

resp m

n = mn ,

iai

dp

n = 0 ,

m > 0 ,
i .

(2.7)

(2.8)

2we absorb a factor of (2i)1 into the denition of every integral that runs around a closed contour

so that, for example,h0

d
 = res0

d
 = 1.

(iii) meromorphic dierentials of the third kind, dp,q

. these have rst order poles
at p and q with opposite residues taking values +1 and 1 respectively. in local
coordinates p (q) about p (q)

dp,q

0 = (1

p + o(1)) dp = (1

q + o(1)) dq .

(2.9)

we shall also normalize the regular part of these dierentials by demanding that

their aiperiods vanish,hai dp,q

0 = 0 , i.

following krichevers construction [4], the moduli space of the universal whitham

hierarchy mg,p is given by the set of algebraic-geometrical data
mg,p  {g, pa, a(p ), a = 1, ..., p}

in which

(2.10)

1. g denotes a smooth algebraic curve of genus g, and p a point on it.

2. pa are a set of p points (punctures) on g in generic positions.

3. a are local coordinates in the neighbourhood of the p points, i.e. a(pa) = 0.

fix a basis point p0. for each given puncture pa, a = 1, 2, ..., p, a set of slow times
t 0
pa,p0 and t n
pa, (n = 1, 2, ...) are assigned in correspondence with the meromorphic
forms dpa,p0
respectively. dening the collective index a = (pa; n), b =
0
etc. (also including the possibility a = (pa, p0; 0)), we shall write t a, t b, ...
(pb; m),
and da, db, .... in its original form, the whitham hierarchy can be dened by the
following set of dierential equations

and dpa
n

da
t b =

db
t a .

(2.11)

the set of data (2.10) specify the quasi-periodic integrable model involved. for example,
a riemann surface with a single puncture provides solutions for the kdv equation. with
two singularities, solutions for the toda lattice can be obtained, etc.

the whitham hierarchy may be further enhanced to incorporate also holomorphic
dierentials, di, with associated parameters i, such that the system (2.11) is enlarged
as follows

di
j =

dj

di
t a =

(2.12)

equations (2.12) are nothing but the integrability conditions implying the existence of a
generating meromorphic dierential ds(i, t a) satisfying


i ds = di

;


t a ds = da

.

(2.13)

moreover, the whitham equations implicitely dene a certain function, the prepotential,
f (i, t a), through the following set of equations

the consistency of (2.13)(2.16) follows from a direct computation, relying solely on rie-
mann bilinear relations. for completeness, the relevant information is given in appendix
a.

due to (2.13) and the denitions in (2.14)(2.16), the local behaviour of ds near each

puncture pa is given by

(2.19)

indeed, it suces to show that near each puncture pa, ds can be expanded as in (2.17).
to this end, one nds from (2.13)(2.16) that the local expansion of di and dpa
n around
pa involve the second derivatives of f as follows:

inserting these expansions in (2.19) and using (2.18) one arrives at (2.17) as desired.

given (2.19) and the normalization (2.7)(2.8), we recognize that the parameters, i,

3 the whitham hierarchy

in this section we adapt the above formalism to the situation that will lead naturally to a
connection with the low-energy dynamics of asymptotically free n = 2 super yangmills
theories with matter hypermultiplets. to this end, we shall specify the particular set of
algebraic-geometrical data that corresponds to the whitham hierarchy of our interest, i.e.
the complex curve g, the set of punctures and the local coordinates in their vicinities.

3.1 the hyperelliptic curve

inspired by the seibergwitten solution to the low-energy dynamics of n = 2 super
yangmills theory with gauge group su(nc) and nf < 2nc massive hypermultiplets [23]
we shall consider the following algebraic curve of genus g = nc  1,

y2 = (p (, uk) + t (, mf ))2  4f (, mf ) ,

where p is the characteristic polynomial,

p (; uk) = nc 

uknck ,

ncxk=2

(3.1)

(3.2)

and  = 2nc  nf is the coecient of the one-loop n = 2 beta function. concerning t
and f , they are polynomials that do not depend on the moduli uk;

f (, mf ) =

nfyr=1

(  mf ) = nf +

nfxj=1

6

tjnf j ,

(3.3)

and t is a homogeneous polynomial in  and mf of degree nf  nc, which is dierent
from zero only when nf > nc. all dependence on t can be absorbed in a redenition
of the classical order parameters so that the eective prepotential, the basic object of
interest, does not depend on it [24]. thus, we can set t = 0, and write the hyperelliptic
curve as follows:

y2 = p 2(, uk)  4f (, mf ) .

(3.4)

this curve represents a double cover of the riemann sphere branched over 2nc points.
the moduli space of this genus g = nc  1 curve is parametrized by the complex numbers
uk, k = 2, ..., nc. in the seibergwitten model, these complex numbers are homogeneous
combinations of the vacuum expectation values of the casimirs of the gauge group su(nc)
and they parametrize the quantum moduli space of vacua, while the mf are constant
parameters related to the bare masses of the hypermultiplets. as explained in the previous
section, a precise choice of the local coordinates a around punctures is in order. these
coordinates are kept xed while coordinates of moduli space are varied. the following
functions w and w1,

w1() =

.

(3.5)

p  y
2f

provide the natural candidates to construct such well-behaved local coordinates. in terms
of them,

y = f(cid:18)w

(3.6)

p = f(cid:18)w +

is, for xed uk and mf ,

note that these formulas are the same as for su(nc) without matter (nf = 0) [12], upon
replacing

nc  n  nc  1/2nf ,

,

y  y  y/f = w 2  4 ,

(3.9)

where now w and y are polinomials of order n in .

notice the appearance of the square root of f . as explained in appendix c, at some
stage of the computation of the derivatives of the prepotential, this square root will be
asked to be a rational function of . unavoidably, f must be a square, f = r2. this
implies that, in the present framework, nf must be an even integer and, moreover, massive
hypermultiplets must come up in degenerated pairs mf = mf +nf /2. in principle one could
think of more perverse possibilities for w1 that generalize the analogous formulas for
su(nc). namely, let

w =

2r

(p + y)

w1 =

2r (p  y)

(3.10)

f =1(m

with r =qnf
f = nf and f = rr. the ansatz in
(3.5) corresponds to a symmetric scenario where r = r = f i.e. nf = n
f = nf /2,
which is the only one that preserves the involution symmetry (, y)  (,y)  w  w1
between the two branches of the riemann surface.

3.2 punctures and local coordinates

besides the curve, the set of algebraic-geometrical data demands the specication of a
set of punctures and local coordinates around them. again, since we are trying to embed
the seibergwitten solution, the natural choice is given by the two points at innity
( = , y = ) plus the 2nf points ( = mf , y = p (mf , uk)), that will be denoted
respectively  and m
f . following [12] the local coordinates will be chosen to be the
appropiate powers of w that uniformize the curve around them. more specically, near
the points , we have y  p () (1 + o(w 2)) so that w1  n . then, in the
vicinities of these punctures,   w1/n  1 near + and   w+1/n  1 close to
. also, near mass punctures m
f , the local coordinates are   w1  (  mf ) for
the symmetric scenario.

the general framework introduced in the previous section would allow us to consider a
whitham system (2.12) given by the whole set of meromorphic dierentials corresponding
to these punctures. this is out of the scope of the present paper and we will restrict
ourselves to a smaller system which is enough to accomodate the seibergwitten solution
of n = 2 super yangmills theories with massive hypermultiplets. namely: we are
not going to include in our discussion meromorphic dierentials of the second kind with
higher poles at m
f . according to the general prescriptions (2.6) and (2.9), the canonical
meromorphic dierentials d

n , associated with times t n

, are expanded as follows

whereas for the dierentials of the third kind we have, after choosing p0 =  ,

4 the generating meromorphic 1-form, ds

in the previous sections we have reviewed the general framework of the whitham hierarchy
and introduced the auxiliary curve. the next ingredient is the generating 1-form ds. at
the end of the day we will manage to identify it, on a certain submanifold of the full
whitham moduli space, with the seibergwitten dierential dssw . let us start by
considering the following set of meromorphic 1-forms

the meromorphic dierentials d n are the natural generalization of the analogous
objects in pure su(nc) [12], which can be recovered after setting, f  1 and n  0
(as long as nf  0). using (4.4), we furthermore see that d 1 takes the familiar form
d 1 =  dw
w which is the seibergwitten dierential [1, 25]. naively, one could be tempted
to consider a dierent set of meromorphic dierentials d 
dw
w , which also
generalizes the pure su(nc) case [26]. however, the seibergwitten dierential would be
in this case a combination of d 
w , which in turn forces the introduction of a
+,. this extra time 3 has to be treated as an independent variable and
new variable t 0
introduces a number of unnecesary complications. in particular, the derivative of f with
respect to it (2.16) is hard to compute on general grounds. with our denition, instead,
every dierential d n has residue balanced between  and all masses mf ,

the proof of this lemma is given in appendix b.

once the basic set of meromorphic dierentials has been described, we can go one step

further and set

ds =xn1

t nd n .

(4.10)

in principle this expression denes ds(t n, uk, mf ). the idea now is to trade the nc1+nf
moduli (uk, mf ), for the equal number of whitham coordinates (i, t 0,f ). in order to do
so, we notice that the structure of poles and periods of ds can be taken into account in
the integrabilistic basis of 1-forms, as in (2.19):

ds =xn1

now, t n are independent variables given by

using (4.7) and (4.10), we can compute i and t 0,f as functions of (t n, uk, mf ):

we can solve these equations for uk and mf as functions of (i, t n, t 0,f ), and this leads
to the whitham equations. these equations just emphasize the role of i, t 0,f and t n as
independent coordinates. more explicitely, making use of (4.13) and (4.14), we demand

in other words, calling l = {uk, mf}, (l = 1, ..., nc + nf  1) the old moduli, and
a = {i, t 0,f}, (a = 1, ..., nc + nf  1) the new ones, the whitham equations assert
that a and t n form a set of independent coordinates:

the solution of these equations embodies functions uk and mf homogeneous of degree
zero in t n, t 0,f and i. this fact follows automatically after multiplying (4.18) by t n
and summing up in n. indeed, we see from (4.13) and (4.14) that a are linear in t m,
thus

5 prepotential derivatives

in the present section, a set of expressions is given for the dependence of the rst
and second derivatives of the prepotential with respect to the independent parameters
(i, t n, t 0,f ) as functions over the moduli space, i.e. of uk and mf . in contrast to the
situation in pure super yangmills, the parameter n = nc  1
2 nf can become as small
as one. for this reason, whenever possible, we have tried to push the range of validity of
the formulas to higher times t n than those in [12]. in each case we will clearly specify
the allowed range.

for this formula to higher times t n, t m up to 1  n, m  2n with n + m  2n, in order
to include at least t 1. in general, when n + m  2n, additional contributions must be

6 duality transformations

as it is well-known, one of the key properties of the seibergwitten ansatz is the existence
of equivalent duality frames for the low-energy theory. in the theories with matter hy-
permultiplets, as already remarked in [1], the duality transformations (which are usually
elements of the symplectic group) pick an inhomogeneous part associated with the masses
of the hypermultiplets. we will show in what follows how all this is nicely encoded in
the present geometrical framework. the duality symmetry will turn out to be nothing
but an ambiguity in the choice of the geometrical data involved in the construction of the
prepotential within the whitham hierarchy. we start by characterizing this ambiguity.

16

~zf =

d~ ,

(5.25)

f

2iz m+

+

for this purpose it is convenient to recall equation (2.24). as it stands, it is just a formal
expression but it nicely exhibits the fact that the dierent duality frames are associated
with dierent choices of integration contours. we will distinguish two types of operations
that can be performed on these contours:

- changes of the symplectic homology basis (ai, bj)  ( ai, bj). these are performed as

usual by means of a matrix ,

 =  a b

c d !  sp(2r, z) ,

(6.1)

where r is the rank of the gauge group and the r  r matrices a, b, c, d satisfy:
(6.2)

atd  c tb = 1, atc = c ta, btd = dtb.

- deformations of the integration contours. when we deform a one-cycle across a pole,
we pick up the residue of ds. in principle, these deformations can be performed
independently on each integration contour.

bearing in mind the equations (4.12)(4.14) and (5.1)(5.3), we see that the previous
operations leave t n, t d

n and t 0,f intact

t n = t n ,

t d
n = t d
n ,

t 0,f = t 0,f .

therefore, the most general ambiguity yields the ansatz

i = a j
d
i d
i = c ijd
t d
0,f = t d

0 f + rf i i + si

j + bijj + pif t 0,f ,
f t 0,f ,
j + di
i + tf g t 0,g ,

jj + qi
f d

(6.3)

(6.4)

(6.5)

(6.6)

together with (6.3), where t 0,f appears on the right hand side because it is the residue
of ds at the pole  = mf . rf i and si
f are matrices of integers that signal the possibility
of deforming the contour between mf and  by encircling additional cycles. also, pif
and qi
f are even (because of the paired masses) integer coecients that account for poles
that are crossed when one-cycle deformations are performed. the extended duality group
is, however, not as big as these formulas may suggest. namely, the deformations in the
contours that dene t d
i cannot occur independently. this is not easy to see
geometrically, but it is a consequence of the fact that a single function, the prepotential,
is behind the whole construction. the representation given in (2.24) is nothing but the

0,f , i and d

17

statement of the fact that f is a homogeneous function of degree two. for the present
case it can be written as

f =

1

2(cid:0)id

0,f(cid:1) ,

i + t nt d

n + t 0,f t d

(6.7)

where repeated indices i, n and f are summed up. plugging (6.3)(6.6) in this formula,
and using (6.2), one easily obtains the transformed f. this expression can be used to
compute  f /i, which should be compared with
 j
i d

 f
i =

j

agreement between both expressions enforces the constraint:

f = pjf c ij  qj

rif = pjf ai

hence (6.6) reduces to

t d

0,f + pif (c ijd

j + di

jj)  qi

f (a j

i d

j + bijj) + tf gt 0,g ,

(6.9)

(6.10)

and, from eq.(6.7), we obtain the generalized duality transformation rule for f (see also
[29]):

1
f( i, t n, t 0,f ) = f (i, t n, t 0,f ) +

(6.11)

using this expression, one can easily compute the transformation properties of the rst
and second derivatives of the prepotential. reserving the indices i, j, k for the cycles i
and d
0,f , and n, m for the higher
whitham times t n, t d

i , f, g for the times associated to the masses t 0,f , t d

(6.12)

to unravel the transformation rules for these couplings the most ecient way is to make
use of their geometrical denition (5.7)(5.12). the geometrical data involved are con-
tours, residues and dierentials. after the previous discussions, the contours change as
follows

inserting (6.13)(6.15) and (6.16)(6.18) in (5.7)(5.12), the transformation rules for the

ij = (cid:2)(a + b)(c + d)1(cid:3)ij

eventually, we nd another contraint on tf g from the requirement of symmetry under
f  g in the last expression. this is solved in general by taking tf g = pi[f qi
g] + s(f g) with
s(f g) an arbitrary integer valued symmetric matrix. it is reassuring to nd that (6.11) and
(6.19)(6.24) fully coincide and generalize the results presented in [17] for pure su(nc)
and [29], to which they reduce when there is only one higher whitham time t n  n1.

7 the seibergwitten hyperplane

in this section we shall identify the seibergwitten solution as a submanifold of the
whitham conguration space. in the former, the ai variables of the prepotential, for the
duality frame associated to the aicycles, are given by the integrals over these cycles of

19

a certain meromorphic one-form, dssw , that can be written as

ai(uk, mf ; ) =iai

dssw iai

w (uk, mf )

pw 2(uk, mf )  42n

d ,

(7.1)

i with bi replacing ai. here, 
and the same expression holds for the dual variables ad
stands for nf , the quantum generated dynamical scale. on the whitham side, corre-
spondingly, we have the i variables given by

i(uk, mf ; t n) = iai
= xn1

d n

ds =xn1
t niai

t niai
((cid:2)w (uk, mf )

pw 2(uk, mf )  4
i(uk, mf ; t 1, t 2, ...) = t 1ai(uk, mf ; 1) + o(t n>1)

= ai(uk, mf ,  = t 1) + o(t n>1) ,

n

n(cid:3)+  n)w (uk, mf )

d ,

(7.2)

and the same for their duals d

i changing ai by bi. using (7.1), one easily sees that

(7.3)

(7.4)

where we have introduced the set of rescaled variables 4

uk = (t 1)k uk

,

mf = t 1 mf .

summarizing, the seibergwitten dierential of [23] can be exactly recovered after per-
forming dimensional analysis in units of the scale set by t 1, and tuning t n>1 = 0. using
(4.14), we also see that the whitham times t 0,f become (up to a sign) the bare masses:

t 0,f =  mf

f = 1, ..., nf /2 .

(7.5)

in view of the previous considerations, we shall dene the following change of variables
(, t 0,f , t n>1, t 1)  (, t 0,f , t n>1, log ), where

log  = log t 1 ,

t n = (t 1)nt n

(n > 1) ,

(7.6)

and, consequently,



 log 

=xm1

mt m 

t m ,


 t n

= (t 1)n 
t n

(n > 1) .

(7.7)

with the help of these expressions, one can rewrite all the formulas given in the last section
for the derivatives of f , as derivatives with respect to i, t 0,f , t n>1 and log . most of

4notice that the variable ai in (5.17), (5.22) and (5.26) stands precisely for ai(uk, mf ; 1).

20

the factors t 1 are used to promote uk to uk or, rather, the homogeneous combinations
thereof

hm+1,n+1 = (t 1)m+nhm+1,n+1  hm+1 = (t 1)m+1hm+1 ,

(7.8)
the remaining ones are absorbed in making up ai  t 1ai(uk, mf ; 1) = ai(uk, mf ; t 1) and
mf  t 1mf (see [17] for this explicit intermediate step).

at the end of the day, the restriction to the submanifold t n>1 = 0 and t 1 = , yields
formulas which are ready for use in the seibergwitten analysis. notice that in this
subspace i(uk, mf ; t 1 = , t n>1 = 0) = ai(uk, mf ,  = t 1)  ai; hence (after omitting
all bars for clarity) one can write

involve deformations of the eective prepotential parametrized by higher whitham times,
the former one (7.9)(7.11) is entirely written in terms of the original seibergwitten
variables.

let us provide in the following section some non-trivial checks supporting these results.

8 some checks

one of the main results in this paper is given by the whole set of equations (7.9)(7.17) for
the derivatives of the eective prepotential. the equation (7.10) is by now a well settled
result. in ref.[15], an independent derivation coming from topological eld theory was
obtained prior to the work [12]. for the pure gauge su(2) case, it was checked by using
the picardfuchs equations in [12]. in refs.[17, 22], it was put in the test bench and two
additional proofs were passed. first of all, the right hand side was shown to reproduce
correctly the appropriate duality transformation rules.
in addition, this equation was
used to obtain the semiclassical expansion of the eective prepotential up to arbitrary
instanton corrections with remarkable sucess. in this section, we will see that equation
(7.13) also enjoys the generalized duality properties and is consistent with the instanton
expansion.

let us rst analyze the duality transformations (6.3)(6.5) and (6.10) where the new
ingredient, as we have already remarked, is the inhomogeneous piece associated to the
presence of masses. this inhomogeneous piece stems from the deformation of contours
across simple poles (6.13)(6.15). we can reinterpret this ambiguity in the context of the
formulas involving the riemann theta function. first of all, the vector ~zf (5.25) lives in
the jacobian of the hyperelliptic curve, as the image of the divisor m+
f  + under the
abel map, thus being dened up to transformations of the form:

zf,i  zf,i + nf,i + ijj

f

(8.1)

with integers nf,i and j
f . taking into account that zf,i = 1/2 if (cf. 5.10), we see that
(8.1) reproduces the formula (6.22), when the symplectic rotation is the identity, with
pi,f = 2ni,f , qj
f . now we can check that the formula (5.26) is consistent with the

f = 2j

22

transformation law given in equation (6.23). using the transformation property of the
theta function under shifts

~(cid:21) (zf,i + nf,i + ijj
(cid:20) ~

f| ) = exp(ii

f ijj

f  2ii

f (zf,i + i) + 2iinf,i)(cid:20) ~

we easily obtain

which induces precisely the transformation law (6.23) with qi

and taking into account (5.17), we nd again the right transformation properties in the
whole set of expressions (6.19)(6.24).

a second, and much more stringent check of equation (7.11) is provided by the semi-

classical expansion of the prepotential in powers of . one can write the ansatz

the set {i}i=1,...,r stands for the simple roots of the corresponding classical lie algebra.

also in (8.4), + denotes a positive root andp+ is the sum over all positive roots. the

dot product () of two simple roots i and j gives an element of the cartan matrix,
aij = ij and extends bilinearly to arbitrary linear combinations of simple roots. for
any root  = njj  , the quantities z are dened by z = a   aiaijnj where
a = aii. simple roots can be written in terms of the orthogonal set of unit vectors
{p}p=1,,nc and the order parameters ai and ep are related by ep = ap. also fk(ai, mf )
are homogeneous functions of degree 2  2kn that represent the instanton corrections to
the perturbative 1-loop eective action.

in refs.[17, 22], it was shown that inserting (8.4) into (7.10), and expanding both
members of the equation in powers of 2n , the instanton corrections fk could be xed
completely in a recursive way. as an example, for su(2) with two degenerated avors

23

(nf = 2) one readily obtains

...

where u2 stands for the quadratic polynomial u2 = a2. once the prepotential expansion
has been solved up to a certain power of , it can be inserted in expression (7.11).
matching both sides is highly non-trivial since this equation involves simultaneously three
dierent types of couplings, namely f  on the left hand side, and if and ij as arguments
of the riemann theta function on the right hand side. we have checked on the computer
that, indeed, this equation is satised order by order for su(2) with nf = 2 up to 6,
for su(3) with nf = 2 and 4 up to 8 and 4 respectively, and for su(4) with nf = 2
and 4 up to order 12 and 8. we believe that this test gives a strong support to the
expression (7.11).

2f

note in passing that, as compared to the usual ansatz for f , the fourth and fth
terms in (8.4) have been added for consistency of all the equations. these terms do not
f
 log ,
depend on ai and, being linear in log , they only contribute to the derivatives
t 0,f  log  and
t 0,f t 0,g ; neither to the couplings nor to the instanton expansion. so,
they correspond to a freedom of the prepotential that is xed by the embedding into the
whitham hierarchy. a similar feature was observed before in the uses of this framework
to study the strong coupling regime of n = 2 pure gauge theories near the maximal
singularities of the quantum moduli space [19].

9 other gauge groups

we can extend the results of previous sections to all classical gauge groups so(2r),
so(2r + 1) and sp(2r) with even nf matter hypermultiplets degenerated in pairs. for
these groups, the characteristic polynomial is

p (, u2k) = 2r 

u2k2r2k ,

rxk=1

24

(9.1)

and the low-energy dynamics of the corresponding n = 2 super yangmills theory is
described by the hyperelliptic curves [30]

y2 = p 2(, u2k)  44r22nf 2

y2 = p 2(, u2k)  44r42nf 4

(9.2)

so(2r + 1) , (9.3)

sp(2r) ,

(9.4)

with a0 = 2rnf +2qnf

j=1 mf . in order to treat sp(2r) on equal footing to the other gauge
groups, it is convenient to restrict to the case where two hypermultiplets are massless,
which we denote by sp(2r). we can then write the hyperelliptic curve for all these cases
as

y2 = p 2(, u2k)  44r2q2nf 2q

(2  m2

f ) ,

(9.5)

nfyj=1

where q = 1 for so(2r), q = 2 for so(2r + 1) and q = 0 for sp(2r) (in this last case, nf
accounts for matter hypermultiplets other than the two mentioned above). these curves
have genus g = 2r  1, where r is the rank of the gauge group. then, if we now adjust
masses to come in pairs, the curves take the form

y2 = p 2(, u2k)  44r2q2nf (qr())2 ,

where

r() =

nf /2yj=1

(2  m2

f ) .

(9.6)

(9.7)

now, similarly to the su(nc) case, we dene w  p/(qr) and the description of the
theory is the same as before, with n = 2r  q  nf . the seibergwitten dierential is
also given by dssw =  dw

w , and its variation with respect to the moduli u2k is

=

2r2kq

w

= 2r2k d
y

= dv2k ,

k = 1, . . . , r .

(9.8)

from the original space of holomorphic dierentials corresponding to the hyperelliptic
curve of genus g = 2r  1, one really deals with a subspace of dimension r, which is the
complex dimension of the quantum moduli space, generated by those invariant under the
reection    [30]. this symmetry, of course, also has to be taken into account in

dssw

u2k (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)w

25

the denition of d n. among the meromorphic dierentials (4.1), only those with odd n
are invariant under this reection. that is, the dierentials we have to consider are

2r  q

nf /2xf =1 hw

2n1

n i+(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=mf

 dw

w

.

(9.9)

with these remarks in mind, one can proceed along the calculations of the preceding
sections obtaining analogous results. clearly, these theories have only odd whitham
times. the recovery of the seibergwitten solution also goes as in the su(nc) case. that
is, one must rescale the times t 2n1 = (t 1)(2n1)t 2n+1, the moduli u2k = (t 1)2k u2k,
and the masses mf = t 1 mf so, for example, i reads

i(u2k, t 1, t 3, t 5, ...) =xn1

d .

(9.10)

then, i(u2k, t 1, t 2n1>3 = 0) = t 1ai(u2k, 1) = ai(u2k,  = t 1). in summary, it is clear
at this point that the same formulas (7.9)(7.17) are obtained for the rst and second
derivatives of the eective prepotential, provided the appropriate value of w and n is
considered, and changing n, m, ... by 2n  1, 2m  1, .... similar checks to the ones dis-
cussed in the previous section were carried out in these cases. moreover, the semiclassical
expansion of the prepotential up to arbitrary instantonic corrections can be recursively
obtained from these equations in a remarkably simple way [22].

10 concluding remarks

in this paper we have undertaken the embedding of the seibergwitten ansatz for the low-
energy eective dynamics of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories with an even number
of massive fundamental hypermultiplets within a whitham hierarchy. aside from its
mathematical beauty, this formalism leads to new dierential equations for the eective
prepotential that can be easily applied to obtain powerful results as its whole semiclassical
expansion [22]. the expressions obtained by these means are also consistent with the
duality properties of the eective couplings, including those resulting from the derivation
of the prepotential with respect to whitham times.

this work opens, or suggests, several interesting avenues for further research. the most
immediate one seems to be its generalizaton to any number of matter hypermultiplets non-
degenerated in mass. this is quite problematic within our present approach. a possible
derivation of the corresponding equations for arbitrary masses is to use the u-plane integral

26

of the topological theory [13]. the second derivatives of the prepotential with respect to
higher whitham times can be understood in that context as contact terms [14]. at the
same time, these contact terms can be obtained from the behavior under blowup of the
twisted low-energy eective action [15]. one should be able to generalize the arguments
explained in ref.[18] to the case of theories with massive hypermultiplets. the rst step
in this direction would be to generalize the u-plane integral of [14] in order to extract
the corresponding blowup formula, and from it one could read the appropriate theta
function. the possible ambiguities in this derivation can be xed in principle by looking
at the behavior at innity, as explained in [18].

the expressions that we have provided extend in most cases the ones in [12] to higher
times, t n, n < 2nc. there is an obvious question about the microscopical origin of these
deformations. in two dimensional topological conformal eld theory they correspond to
marginal deformations by gravitational descendants. it would be very interesting to have
a clear understanding of the corresponding operators here.

in ref.[17], it was shown that the whitham times provide generalized spurionic sources
for soft breaking of supersymmetry down to n = 0. in this spirit, the additional times
t 0,f would also admit an interpretation as spurion superelds. the formulas we have
obtained in the present paper are ready for use in a study of such softly broken theories
along the lines of [17, 29].

another interesting possibility is the use of the new equations (7.9)(7.17) to study
the strong coupling expansion of the prepotential near the singularities of the quantum
moduli space, as it was done in ref.[19] for the case of pure su(nc). finally, another
avenue for future research is, certainly, the connection of this formalism with the string
theory and d-brane approach to supersymmetric gauge theories, where some steps has
already been given in the last few years [31]. we believe that all these matters deserve
further study.

c meromorphic dierentials and the szego kernel

in this appendix we shall give the details leading to expressions (5.22) and (5.26) in the
main text. as we say in section 5 the residues appearing in the calculations of the second
derivatives of the prepotencial with respect to t n and t m and with respect to t n and
t 0,f involve dierentials dened with respect to  (not to w). this dierentials can be
computed using the szego kernel, as will be shown in the next subsections.

meromorphic dierentials of second kind, d n(), are generated by some bi-dierential
w (, ) upon expanding it around   .

the key ingredient is the so-called szego kernel

e(, ) =

where e(, ) is the prime form. in terms of the szego kernel,

w (, ) = e(, )e(, )  di()dj()(cid:18) 1

(c.1)

(c.2)

(c.3)

e(, ) is a 1/2-bidierential that has a simple hyperelliptic representation whenever
e denotes an even non-singular characteristic e = e = e. such characteristics are in
one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the set of 2g + 2 ramication points into
two equal subsets, {r
 ) =
q+()q(). in this particular case [27]

 ,  = 1, 2, ..., g + 1}, such that y2() =qg+1

if we now assume the symmetric scenario, i.e. values of mf come in pairs, then there

is as privilegiate choice for q = p  2f . the characteristic e appearing in (c.3) is

associated with the splitting of the roots of the discriminant [28][12] and for this particular
case we have that [17]

c.2 third kind dierential

the third kind meromorphic dierential dp,q
in terms of the prime form [27, 32] as follows

e(, p )

(c.12)

also, an explicit representation in terms of the szego kernel (c.4) can be found (see
proposition 2.10 in ref.[27]),

is the image of the divisor q  p under the abel map. when e = e = e is an even
half-integer characteristic, i log (~z |  ) is odd under ~z  ~z so i log e(0| ) = 0.
letting p = m
f and q = , and making use of (c.4) and (c.5) as well as u() =
