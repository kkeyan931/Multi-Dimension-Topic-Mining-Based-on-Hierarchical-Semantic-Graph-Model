abstract

the classical probe dynamics of the eleven-dimensional massless superparticles in the
background geometry produced by n source m-momenta is investigated in the framework
of n-sector dlcq supergravity. we expand the probe action up to the two fermion terms
and nd that the fermionic contributions are the spin-orbit couplings, which precisely
agree with the matrix theory calculations. we comment on the lack of non-perturbative
corrections in the one-loop matrix quantum mechanics eective action and its compati-
bility with the supergravity analysis.

the su(n) matrix quantum mechanics, also called matrix theory, is believed to pro-
vide the quantum description of the eleven-dimensional supergravity in the n   limit
in the framework of the discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq), the correspon-
[1].

dence between the matrix quantum mechanics and the eleven-dimensional supergravity

is conjectured to elevate to the case of the nite n and nite eleventh circle size r [2].

upon taking the large n limit while keeping the ratio p = n/r xed, the same limit

as the one in the case of the innite momentum frame formulation of ref. [1] can be

attained from the dlcq framework, according to the argument of ref. [2]. within the

dlcq framework, the precise agreement between the matrix quantum mechanics and the

classical eleven-dimensional massless particle probe dynamics, corresponding to two-body
m-momentum scatterings, was demonstrated in ref. [3]4. specically the bosonic one-
loop f 4 term computed from the matrix quantum mechanics turns out to be identical to
the classical bosonic action v4 term for the massless particles moving along the m theory

circle [3].

the matrix quantum mechanics has sixteen supercharges. therefore, the existence of
the one-loop bosonic f 4 term in the eective action implies the existence of the terms

with higher (even) fermion numbers, up to eight fermion terms [6, 7]. within the matrix

quantum mechanics, by perturbative analysis, two fermion terms [8], four fermion terms

[9] and eight fermion terms [10] were explicitly calculated. the general structure and

explicit form of the fermion terms were also analyzed from the ten-dimensional iia string

theory approach [6, 8, 11] and from the eleven-dimensional supergravity perspective [5].

a key issue to consider when approaching the problem from the type iia side analysis

(being the small r analysis) is whether taking the large n (thereby large r) limit will

induce substantial non-perturbative corrections. in the case of the d2-brane scatterings

described by the (2+1)-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills theory, for example, there

are indeed big instanton corrections in the large r limit [12, 13, 14, 15]. a surprising

answer, at least from the matrix quantum mechanics point of view, is that there are no

non-perturbative corrections as shown by the non-renomalization theorem of sethi, stern

4in ref. [4], an lsz formalism for the scattering problems in the context of the eleven-dimensional
m theory was developed. recently, the general two-body scattering perturbative dynamics in m theory
was systematically analyzed in ref. [5] up to four fermion terms. we note that, up to four fermion terms,
the spin eects are the spin-orbit coupling type.

and paban [16]. thus, the fermion terms computed from both the iia theory side and

the perturbative matrix quantum mechanics side, without any further corrections, should

match the classical, eleven-dimensional m-momentum scattering dynamics, including all

(up to eight) fermion terms, if the matrix quantum mechanics is to describe the complete

eleven-dimensional supergravity as conjectured.

given these developments, there are at least two issues that require better under-

standing. first, we need manifestly eleven-dimensional and supersymmetric description

of the classical m momentum dynamics, which does not rely on the assumption of small

r. this does not only give us a framework that is valid for the large r limit, but also

yields a substantial technical benet of the straightforward implementation of the dlcq

prescription, which is easy to implement in the eleven dimensional set-up [17, 18, 19]. for

example, in the analysis of refs. [6] and [7], it is unclear how to implement the dlcq

prescription and how to incorporate the large r, strong coupling eects for the fermion

terms. second, the spin eects for the probe m-momentum should be incorporated. in

the case of ref. [8], the rotation eect resulting from the spinning source d-particles,

represented by the o-diagonal elements of the background metric in a standard fash-

ion, was shown to account for the two fermion spin-orbit coupling terms of the matrix

quantum mechanics, while the probe d-particle was assumed to be spinless. considering

the two-body nature of the source-probe dynamics, it will not make a lot of dierence

whether we assign spins to source d-particles or to probe d-particles, especially as far

as spin-orbit couplings are concerned. however, the matrix theory predicts the existence

of the eight fermion terms [10], and it turns out that the eight fermion interaction is of

the spin-spin type; we clearly need to consider both spinning source and spinning probe

d-particles (or m-momenta) at the classical level. it is unclear how to incorporate the

eects of the spinning probes along the line of the supergravity side calculation of ref. [8].

to reproduce eight fermion terms from the eleven-dimensional supergravity analysis, as

suggested by the membrane static potential calculations of ref. [20], we need to consider

the couplings between the background gravitino eld, produced by the spinning source

m-momenta, and the spin fermion elds of the probe m-momenta. thus, the inclusion

of the spin fermions for the probe m-momenta is essential.

2

in this paper, we positively solve the two issues raised in the above. we consider the

superspace formulation of the spinning massless superparticle action in the presence of the

eleven-dimensional background geometry. by rewriting the superspace elds in terms of

the component elds up to two fermion terms (the fermion eld here represents the spin of

the probe particle), we show that the eleven-dimensional, classical, massless superparticle

probe action expanded up to two fermion terms, in the presence of the spinless source

m-momenta, becomes the form of the matrix quantum mechanics eective action up

to one-loop and two fermion terms. we then choose an appropriate harmonic function,

forced upon us by the dlcq prescription, to describe the bosonic background geometry

produced by source m-momenta. we nd that the two actions precisely agree under this

choice. our set-up for the classical supergravity calculations is eleven-dimensional and is

able to account for the probe spin eects.

our so(1, 10) spinor conventions are as follows. the eleven-dimensional 32  32

gamma matrices r (r = 0, 1,   , 9, 11) that we use in this paper are given by

0 =   0

where i16 is the 16  16 identity matrix and i are real 16  16 so(9) gamma matrices
(i = 1,   , 9). our signature choice for the metric is ( +   +) and the gamma matrices
satisfy (0) = 0 and (i) = i. therefore, for the eleven-dimensional majorana
spinors  and , we have  =  and r1rk  = (1)k(k+1)/2 r1rk. here r1rk is
the totally anti-symmetrized k-product with the normalization factor k!.

we start from the description of the background geometry of the n-sector dlcq

supergravity. the eleven-dimensional metric is given by5 [17] [19]

here ~r denotes a nine-dimensional position ~r = (x1,   x9). the asymptotically light-like
coordinate  = x+/2 plays the role of the time-coordinate and x is compactied via the
identication x  x + 2 [17]. until the stage where we compare our supergravity
results to the matrix theory results, we will not make any specic assumption about the
form of the function h(r) shown in eq. (3). in terms of (t, x11) coordinates dened by
x = x11  t, the metric eq. (2) can be rewritten as

(6)

consistent with the existence of the sixteen unbroken supersymmetries. we use (, , ,  )
indices for the curved space bosonic coordinates, and the tangent space bosonic indices
are represented as (r, s, t,  ). since the function f depends only on the transversal coor-
dinates (x1,   , x9), we can set the covariantly constant spinor  as  = f(32) where f is
a function of the transversal coordinates and (32) is a constant 32-component majorana

spinor. the  = 0 and  = 11 components of eq. (6) implies that

(0 + 11)(32) = 0  011(32) = (32) ,

while the  = i component gives

(i +

noting that eq. (7) implies that 011 = , we can solve eq. (8) immediately to get

in the superspace formulation in terms of the superspace coordinates

z m () = (x() , ())

as functions of the world-line time coordinate , the manifestly space-time supersymmetric

particle action can be written down as follows:

s = z dl = mz d(rsrs)1/2  mz d(g(z))1/2 .

(10)

the pull-back6 a of the supervielbein7 ea
m to the particles world-line satises a =
(dz m /d)ea
m . the metric rs is the lorentz invariant constant metric and m denotes
the particle mass, for which we will take m  0 limit. when taking this limit, since the
background elds do not have any explicit dependence on x, we keep the momentum

p =

(g(z))1/2 rsr s

 x = xed ,

(11)

where the overdot represents the derivative with respect to . this implies that as m  0,
we have to require g(z) = 0. just as in ref. [3], we then have to compute the routhian

which reduces to

l = l  p x(p) ,

m0l = p x ,

(12)

(13)

in the massless limit. we have to solve x from the condition g(z) = 0 and plug it into

eq. (13) to compute the action. for this purpose, we set

r = xar

and the condition g(z) = 0 can be solved for x in terms of ar

 and b as

(15)

to write down an explicit action for the spin-orbit couplings in a given background

geometry, we have to expand the action, eq. (13), to the quadratic terms in the eleven-

dimensional majorana spinor variable , which represents the probe m-momentum spin.

we can derive the following covariant expression for the superelds in terms of the com-

ponent elds up to the quadratic terms in the fermionic variable ;

r = x(er

(16)

which is valid when the background gravitino eld and the tensor gauge elds are zero,
corresponding to the spinless background geometry of eq. (2). here er

s are the bosonic
elfbeins of the background geometry. the derivation of eq. (16) closely parallels the

similar calculations in the case of the supermembranes in ref. [21], and relies on the

simplifying feature that the background elds are all on-shell, satisfying the classical

equations of motion. unlike the case of the ten-dimensional d-particles where the super-

generalization is dicult due to the existence of the rr one-form gauge eld, in the

eleven-dimensional context starting from the action (10), the long range elds that mediate
interactions are all gravitational metric elds. using eq. (16), we can compute ar

up to the quadratic order terms in . the massless superparticle action possesses local

fermionic -symmetry, which in our context can be straightforwardly veried in the einbein

formulation. under the background choice of eq. (2), we impose the following -projection

condition for the spinor 

(0 + 11) = 0  011 =    =   (16)
(16) !

(19)

that results from the -symmetry gauge xing. here, (16) is a sixteen component so(9)

spinor. the killing spinors  corresponding to the unbroken supersymmetry generators
satisfy 011 =  from the killing spinor equation (7). on the other hand, the broken
supersymmetry generators satisfy the same condition as the projection condition imposed

6

in eq. (19). in terms of the  = 110 that satisfy (+)2 = ()2 = 0 and () = ,
the projection condition eq.(19) can be expressed as

+ = 0,

which implies t  = 0. thus, the dirac conjugate   it 0 can be written as

 = it 1

(+  ) = it  ,

(20)

(21)

where  = +/2. this computation is consistent with our previous choice of the  = x+/2

as a time-coordinate.

we choose the static gauge x = 1 and we set xi = vi. we then use the majorana

properties of , the non-vanishing components of the spin connections shown in eq. (5),

and eqs. (17), (18), (19), to explicitly compute

in general, the classical bps solution space described by our metric eq. (2) has the
form of n-copy symmetric product, sn (r9), corresponding to the multi-center n m-
momentum solutions. the terms of order o(v2) of eq. (27), however, has the standard

at space-time normalization regardless of the choice of the harmonic function h. from

the matrix theory point of view, it was shown in ref. [16] that the supersymmetric yang-

mills quantum mechanics moduli space is at, even at the non-perturbative level. this

behavior from the matrix theory side is thus consistent with the rst two terms of the

action (27). from eq. (5) of ref. [8], we have

we observe that eq. (28) is the same as eq. (27), once we choose h(r) = (15/2)(1/r7)

and identify

j ij =

t ij ,

(29)

except for the rst constant term in eq. (28) and the fermion derivative terms in eq. (27).

the spin-orbit term in the eective action (28) was already shown in ref. [8] to agree

with the matrix theory two fermion terms.

in the context of the membrane dynamics in the dlcq supergravity, the classical

eleven-dimensional supergravity calculations capture the non-perturbative instanton cor-

rections of the (2+1)-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills theory [22]. for particle

dynamics, however, the eleventh direction is part of the longitudinal space-time of the

m-momenta metric (2) in sharp contrast to the membrane case analyzed in ref. [22].

thus, the eleven-dimensional supergravity calculation, eq. (27), produces the same result

as the ten-dimensional iia d-particle calculations, eq. (28). from the matrix theory

point of view, the type iia calculations and the perturbative matrix quantum mechanics

calculations [5]-[11] are not corrected by the non-perturbative eects [16].

the background geometry favored by the dlcq prescription was shown to possess

sixteen killing spinors. from our approach, it is in principle straightforward to further

include the spinning source eects (thus, to compute eight fermion terms from super-

gravity), even though the actual computations will be considerably involved. we can

simply turn on the gravitino elds (by acting the broken supersymmetry transformations

8

(with the generator ) on the bosonic background elds, eq. (2)) and, thereby, the o-

diagonal metric elements produced by the spinning source m-momenta, proportional to
j ij = i
2t ij. in other words, we expect that, similar to ref. [20], the detailed forms of
the gravitino and metric elds can be obtained by the supersymmetric variation by the

sixteen broken supersymmetry generators. if jij had the purely bosonic origin, it would
be dicult to imagine that only the terms up to j n

ij, where n is nite, show up in the
eective action, as the matrix theory analysis shows. further works along this line are in

progress.
