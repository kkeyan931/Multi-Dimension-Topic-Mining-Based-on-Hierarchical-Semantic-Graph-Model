(27) (28) constraints (23) (25) weak strongcoupling regimes, respectively, result hw(0) 2 hs(0) = 2. but, eqs. (27) (28), shown h(0) must satisfy h(0) = d2 2 h(0) i(0), h(0) = 2 (2i/d)(0). weak density function must satisfy strong density function must satisfy iw(0) 0, is(0) = 0. (29) (30) therefore, analytical properties h(z) two regimes must con- straints (29) (30) satised. using standard method solving integral equations , one show expression hw(z) = 1 2iq(z a)(z b)ic rw()d (z )q( a)( b) , (31) correct analytical behaviour weakcoupling region. contour c (31) contour encircling cut  excluding z. deforming c contour around point z contour c (a contour innity), one nds hw(z) = rw(z) + 1 2iq(z a)(z b)ic rw()d (z )q( a)( b) .
