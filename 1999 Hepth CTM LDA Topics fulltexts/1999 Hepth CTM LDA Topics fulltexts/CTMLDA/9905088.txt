(2.12) made explicit x dependent initial condition. also expand initial value, w (t0) = w 0(t0) + (t0), (t0) = xn=1 nw n(t0). unperturbed equation reads dx 0 dt = f 0(x 0). promised, suppose attractive manifold found equation c integral constant vector dimc = may depend t0. x 0(t) = r(s(t; c)), 10 (2.13) (2.14) (2.15) (2.16) comes important point method; identify s(t0) = c(t0), (2.17) gives natural parameterization manifold m0. simple sig- nicant observation; notice need give ansatz representation manifold solve unperturbed equation integral constants trivially obtained. deformation manifold determined perturbatively two principles, i.e., 1. function independent w 0, 2. resultant dynamics simple possible interested reduce dynamics simpler one. choice intimately related forms perturbative solutions. example, rst order equation reads dx 1 dt = f 0(x 0)x 1 + p (x 0). (2.18) solution inhomogeneous equation composed sum general solution homogeneous equation special solution inhomogeneous equation. unperturbed solution x 0(t) part neutrally stable solution, appear secular terms special solution well genuinely independent functions. turns secular terms utilized renormalize homogeneous solutions = t0; kind renormalization conditions. shift initial value determined w 1(t0) = x 1(t = t0). (2.19) notice initial value determined solving equation, hence functional form function t0 explicitly given. course, one make w 1(t0) = 0 adding unperturbed solutions; prescription, however, generally give complicated dynamics. means choice ambiguities, demand obtain simplest dynamics give uniquely. 3 4, shall give mathematical mechanical procedure select initial values accordance rules using examples. repeat procedure order perturbation. remark procedure modication initial value (t0) hence total initial value w (t0) given solely terms c(t0); w (t0) = w 0 + .

(2.22) eq.s (2.21) (2.22) essentially basic postulates kuramotos theory reduc- tion evolution equations. thus derived kuramotos basic equations rg method; words, kuramotos theory actually rg theory reduc- tion evolution equations. eq.(2.22) means dynamics renormalized c. one see correspondence renormalizability theory quantum eld theory existence nite dimensional invariant manifold theory dynamical systems: c = (c1, c2, . . . , cm) correspond collection renor- malizable coupling constants unrenormalizable operators; one may say fact represented solely c analogue polchinski theorem quantum eld theory. remark also eq.(2.22) justies slaving principle haken. comment order; unperturbed system given linear operator jordan cell, slight modication scenario due technical complexity; see example next section general argument given 4. 3 simple examples section, consider four simple equations show formulation rg method work tool reduction evolution equations. shall show initial values = t0 higher orders determined two principles terms proportional unperturbed solution suppressed possible fast motions disappear. resultant forms unperturbed solutions composed secular terms vanish = t0 functions independent unperturbed solution. nal forms turn given scheme adopted , unstable manifolds cases jordan cell dealt though. resultant initial value represent invariant manifold, rg equation gives slow dynamics manifold. 12 3.1 simple model reduction rst consider following simplest equation reduction; dx/dt = f (x, y), (3.1) writing u(x, y) = t(x, y) expanding u u = u0 + u1 + , un(x, y) = t(xn, yn) (n = 0, 1, ...). solve equation initial value w (t0) = t0. suppose w (t0) attractive manifold m. dy/dt = + g(x). unperturbed equation reads x0 = 0, y0 = y0 + g(x0), (3.2) y0(t) = g(c0) + c1et, solution readily obtained x0(t) = const. = c0, ci (i = 0, 1) integral constants; make explicit ci may depend initial time t0 ci = ci(t0). since interested asymptotic behavior , take stationary solution putting c1 = 0; accordingly, x0(t) = const. = c0, y0(t) = g(c0), w 0(t0) = t(c0, g(c0)), suggests unperturbed invariant manifold m0 given although time dependence x(t) yet known. = g(x), rst order equation reads (t a) x1 y1! = f (x0, y0) 0 !, 0 =(cid:18) 0 g(x0) 1(cid:19) . au 1 = 0, au 2 = (1)u 2; u 1 = 1 notice 1!. g!, u 2 = 0 (3.3) (3.4) (3.5) (3.6) (3.7) (3.8) special solution initial value w 1(t0) obtained follows: y1! = e(tt0)aw 1(t0) +z x1 t0 dse(ts)a f (x0, y0) 0 !, = e(tt0)a + {(t t0)f u 1 f gu 2}. (3.9) 13 used relation t(1, 0) = u 1 gu 2. solution describe slow motion, rst term vanish; thus naturally led choice initial value w 1(t0) = f gu 2, (3.10) kill fast motion. thus also x1(t; t0) = f (c0, g(c0))(t t0), y1(t; t0) = f (c0, g(c0))g(c0){(t t0) 1}. (3.11) notice solution initial value satisfy rules given preceding subsection; w 1(t0) (t0) independent w 0(t0). order, u(t; t0) =(cid:18) x(t; t0) w (t0) = x(t0) c0(t0) + f (c0, g(c0))(t t0) y(t; t0)(cid:19) =(cid:18) y(t0)! w 0(t0) + (t0) = g(c0) g(c0)f (c0, g(c0))(1 + t0 t)(cid:19) , g(c0) g(c0)f (c0, g(c0))!. (3.12) (3.13) c0 rg equation eq.(2.5) applied eq.(3.12) gives evolution equation c0(t); dc0 dt = f (c0, g(c0)). (3.14) since x(t) = c0(t), eq.(3.14) gives reduced dynamics, slow manifold given u(t) = w (t), terms components, x(t) = c0(t), y(t) = g(c0) g(c0)f (c0, g(c0))). one sees attractive manifold given y(x) = g(x) g(x)f (x, g(x)), (3.15) (3.16) original two-dimensional evolution equation reduced one-dimensional equation eq.(3.14). short, obtain invariant manifold slow dynamics it, started neutrally stable solution integral constant, constitutes natural representation invariant manifold. constant moves slowly perturbation whole dynamics given slow variable. evolution equation slow dynamics given rg equation trajectory invariant manifold given initial value rg method uniquely. initial value higher order determined fast motion disappears. generic systems linear matrix zero eigenvalue extensively analyzed 4. 14 3.2 unperturbed solution oscillatory present subsection, shall examine case unperturbed solution another type neutral stability, i.e., oscillatory . shall treat simplest equation damped oscillator geometrical terms putting emphasis fact rg method concerns initial value. recent monograph, nishiura used example indicate careful identication initial values higher order terms needed construct proper perturbative solutions obtaining meaningful result rg method, though failed give general principles careful identication. one see general principles given foreword section determine initial values uniquely, hence nishiuras concern resolved. one also see initial values thus obtained forms obtained . equation deal x + x + x = 0, (3.17) 0 < < 1. system exhibit decrease degrees freedom, nevertheless dynamics reduced set simpler equations amplitude phase, separately rg equation. denition u = t(x, y), = x, eq.(3.17)is converted y!, (t a)u = 0 =(cid:18) 0 1 0(cid:19) . 1 (3.18) (3.19) expand dependent variable initial value taylor series u(t) = u0 + u1 + 2u2 + w (t0) = w 0 + w 1 + 2w 2 + , ui = t(xi, yi). lowest order solution reads (complex) integral constant c(t0); y0(t; t0)!, u0(t; t0) = ceitu + + ceitu x0(t; t0) (3.20) u = t(1,i); au = iu . neutrally stable solution. initial value order reads, w 0(t0) = z(t0)u + + c.c., z(t0) = c(t0)eit0. 15 (3.21) (3.22) c.c. denotes complex conjugate. rst order equation reads (t a)u1 = y0(t) 1 2i (u + u ), (3.23) initial condition u1(t0, t0) = w 1(t0) yet known determined. equation readily solved follows; u1(t; t0) = e(tt0)aw 1(t0) = e(tt0)a(cid:20)w 1(t0) 1 2i leads natural choice initial value 2(cid:20){(t t0)ceitu + 1 t0 1 1 2iz dse(ts)ay0(s)(u + u ), 2i{ceit0u + ceit0 u }(cid:21) ceitu } + c.c.(cid:21) , . w 1(t0) = 1 2i{z(t0)u + z(t0)u } = 1, (3.24) (3.25) otherwise rst term (3.24) gives rise terms could renormal- ized away unperturbed solution redenition c. emphasize renormalization procedure enters here. hence u1(t; t0) = 1 2{(t t0)c(t0)eitu + 1 2i y1(t; t0)!. c(t0)eitu } + c.c. x1(t; t0) (3.26) similarly, second order solution given u2(t; t0) = e(tt0)aw 2(t0) 2iz = e(tt0)a(cid:20)w 2(t0) { 1 dse(ts)ay1(s)(u + u ), t0 eit0u + c.c.}(cid:21) c 16 + ic 8 eit + c.c.. (3.27) thus led choice initial value w 2(t0) = 1 16 z(t0)u + c.c. = 2, (3.28) reason rst-order case. hence u2(t; t0) = ic 8 eit + c.c.. (3.29) collecting terms second order, u(t; t0) = ceitu + c 2 {(t t0)u + + 2 u }eit, + i2c 8 eit + c.c., (3.30) 16 initial value w (t0) = z(t0){u + 4 u 2 16 u } + c.c.. rg equation eq.(2.21) gives c + (/2 + i2/8)c = 0. (3.31) (3.32) parameterizing c c = (a/2) exp(i), equations governing amplitude phase, respectively, + /2 = 0, = 2/8, (3.33) yields a(t) = a0e/2t (t) = 2t/8 + 0 a0 0 constants. since u(t) = w (t), nal solution damped oscillator x(t) = a0e/2t{(1 2 16 ) cos(t + 0) + 4 sin(t + 0)}, (3.34) = 1 2/8 angular velocity. expression slightly dierent given  equation treated scalar equation; redenition constants a0 0 transforms solutions order. see although number dimension equation changed, dynamics reduced simpler equations (3.33) amplitude phase. initial values higher order equations determined terms proportional unperturbed solution appear; higher order terms renormalized away redenition integral constant unperturbed solution. comment order: solution could eciently obtained using operator method (implicitly) adopted  fully accounted appendix present article. instance, rst order solution operator method reads u1(t; t0) = 1 2 (t a)1(ceit ceit)(u + u ), (3.35) readily evaluated use (a. 9) (a. 10). second order solution also readily obtained use formulae given appendix a. 3.3 unstable motion double-well potential next, show unstable manifolds also constructed present method, using double-well potential mechanics; x = x x3. 17 (3.36) let us obtain unstable motion around origin applying rg method. example peculiar case unperturbed solution neutrally stable composed blowing decaying function exponent. shall treat another example type 5.2. putting x = dening u = t(x, y), system equation x3!. dt a! u = 0 (3.37) solve equation around arbitrary = t0 initial value w (t0). solution written u = u(t; t0, w (t0)). expand u = u0 + u1 + . accordingly initial value w (t0) determined self-consistently also expanded w = w 0 + w 1 + . lowest order solution reads u0(t; t0) = c+(t0)etu + + c(t0)etu , (3.38) suppressed w -dependence u0 u = t(1,1) eigen- vectors belonging eigenvalues 1, respectively. initial value w 0(t0) accordingly reads w 0(t0) = u0(t0; t0) = c+(t0)et0 u + + c(t0)et0u , imply trajectory hyperbolic curve m0 = {u = (x, y)|(x + y)(x y) = const} (3.39) (3.40) asymptotic lines = x. rst order equation reads dt a! u1 = 1 2 (c+(t0)et + c(t0)et)3(u + u ), (3.41) solved initial value w 1(t0) formally u1(t; t0) = e(tt0)aw 1(t0) 1 2z t0 dse(ts)a(c+(t0)es + c(t0)es)3(u + u ), (f+(t0; t0)u + + f(t0; t0)u )] 1 2 = e(tt0)a. (3.46) applying rg equation u(t; t0) = u0(t; t0) + u1(t; t0), one obtains du dt0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0=t leads = c+etu + + cetu + 3 2{c 2 +cetu + c+c 2 etu +} = 0, (3.47) c+ = 3 2 c 2 +c, c = 3 2 c+c 2 . (3.48) noting c+(t)c(t) = const c+c, one obtains solution rg equation follows; c+(t) = c+e3c+ct/2, c(t) = ce3c+ct/2.
