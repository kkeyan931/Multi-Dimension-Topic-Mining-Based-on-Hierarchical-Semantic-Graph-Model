abstract

the higgs model is generalized so that in addition to the radial higgs eld there are elds
which correspond to the themasy and entropy. the model is further generalized to include
state and sign parameters. a reduction to the standard higgs model is given and how to break
symmetry using a non-zero vev (vacuum expectation value) is shown. a uid rotation can
be performed on the standard higgs model to give a model dependent on the entropy and
themasy and with a constant mass.

one of the outstanding problems of particle physics is whether the higgs eld exists; these hypo-
thetical elds are conjectured to make non-abelian gauge elds a
i , describe massive particles as
needed by the standard particle physics models. there are [2] alternatives to higgs scalar elds
which use uids instead. apart from it being a good idea to have alternative models, the reason for
producing these particular uid alternatives can be addressed after outlining the principles below:

the principle that: all fundamental elds are gauge elds. the success of non-abelian
gauge vector elds in describing fundamental interactions suggests the principle that all
fundamental field are gauge fields. taken at face value this implies that the higgs
elds used in symmetry breaking should also be a gauge eld: as it is a scalar eld at rst
sight this seems impossible. a way around this is to have a collection of scalar elds with the
properties that: rstly they encompass the standard higgs mechanism, secondly they form
a gauge system. this can be realized by using the scalar eld description of a perfect uid,
and then charging it via a  da = a + ieaa, as described below.

1

the: extreme principle of equivalence. the extreme principle of equivalence is that there

is only one concept of mass in physics. [2], and this extended principle requires the
equivalence of these masses to all other masses, including those generated by symmetry
breaking mechanisms.

the: redundancy of ad hoc procedures. this principle is that any principled expla-
nation (perhaps not only scientific) of anything is preferable to an ad hoc
calculational procedure which produces an equivalent or inferior result. it
leaves open what to choose if the ad hoc calculational procedure produces a superior result,
or how to address the quality of the result. in the present case higgs scalar elds are ad hoc
whereas uids might arise from the statistical properties of the non-abelian gauge elds.

1.2 application of these principle to symmetry breaking.

re-writing procedure. there are well known techniques by which stresses involving scalar
elds can be rewritten as uids, so that it is possible to re-write the standard model with uids
instead of higgs scalars. my rst attempt at using uids for symmetry breaking [2] was essentially
to deploy these rewriting procedures to convert the scalar elds to uids; the drawback of this
approach is the uids that result are somewhat unphysical, however an advantage is that symmetry
breaking occurs with a change of state of the uid.

velocity potential method. my second attempt [3] used the decomposition of a perfect uid
vector into several scalar parts called vector potentials and identifying one of these with the radial
higgs scalar; thus the theory is a generalization of the standard theory, so that any experimental
verication of the standard theory does not negate it. the gauge elds are then introduced by using
the usual covariant substitutions for the partial derivatives of the scalars, for example a = a 
a = a + ieaa, and calling the resulting uid the covariantly interacting fluid. this
results in an elegant extension of standard higgs symmetry breaking, but with some additional
parameters present. previous work on the vector potentials shows that some of these have a
thermodynamic interpretation, it is hoped that this is inherited in the uid symmetry breaking
models. the additional parameters can be partially studied with the help of an explicit lagrangian,
see below. both of my approaches have been so far restricted to abelian gauge elds.

1.3 the lagrangian formulation of uids.

a perfect uid has a lagrangian formulation in which the lagrangian is the pressure p. variation
is achieved by using the rst law of thermodynamics

dp = n dh  nt ds,

(1)

where n is the particle number, t is the temperature, s is the entropy, and h the enthalpy. in four
dimensions a vector can be decomposed into four scalars, however the ve scalar decomposition

hv = w =  + x

(i)s(i),

vv  = 1,

(2)

i

(i) = 1, 2 is often used, because for i = 1, s and  = r t d have interpretation, roberts (1997)
[3], as the entropy and the thermasy respectively. from now on the index (i) is suppressed as
it is straightforward to reinstate. replacing the rst law with dp = vdw   nt ds, variation
gives the familiar stress and scalar evolution equations. previously, roberts (1997) [3], all partial
derivatives in the above have been replaced with vector covariant derivatives

to obtain a generalization of scalar electrodynamics called uid electrodynamics. for many inter-
acting uids the interaction terms can be disregarded, anile (1990) [4], however here all interaction

d =  + ie a,

(3)

terms are kept. quantization of these models is not looked at here although uids can be quantized,
roberts (1999) [5]. here instead of using the rst law for variation a specic explicit lagrangian
is assumed. this xes the equation of state. since previous work three things are approached
dierently. the rst is the best conventions for the scalar decomposition are 2. this is because the
spacetime index is put on s as this will allow easier generalization to second order non-equilibrium
thermodynamics, israel and stewart (1979) [6]. the + convention is used for  and s in 2 (rather
than s). the second is that the uid remains isentropic after charging. the third is that two
vector normalization conditions are required after charging. equivalences between uids and scalar
elds were rst studies by tabensky and taub (1973) [7]. thermodynamical quantities can be in-
troduced into the standard higgs model via the partition function kapusta (1989) [8]. clearly the
entropy, temperature and so on cannot occur from both the vector 2 and the partition function,
perhaps a suitable partition function for the present model might allow both to be identied. an
approach which dispenses with higgs elds is that of nicholson and kennedy (2000) [9], another
approach which involves gravity is that of kakushadze and langfelder (2000) [10].

2 explicit lagrangians

consider the lagrangian

l(q, q) = (ww )r  q(q),

(4)

where r is called the equation of state parameter (see equation 9),  is called the sign parameter
and q is the potential. varying with respect to the metric and then assuming the stress is of the
form of a perfect uid implies

 2(1)rrw 2r2

 ww = (p + )vv.

normalization v 2

 = 1 and hv = w implies

w 2r

 = (1)rh2r.

recall that l = p, together with the above three equations this gives

p = h  q,  = (2r  1)h2r + q, n = 2rh2r1.

varying l with respect to ,  and s respectively

(nv )  q = 0,  n s  q = 0,

(nv )  q = 0,

this is a perfect uid; when q = 0 it has the -equation of state

1 <  =

particular cases are r = 1 which implies  = 2 which is the equation of state for coherent radiation;
and r = 2 which implies  = 4
3 which is the equation of state for incoherent radiation. the canonical
momenta are

the constrained hamiltonian is

 = n,  = 0, s = n.

h = (  +  s) + 1(s  ) + 2  l,

(10)

(11)

where 1 and 2 are the lagrange multipliers. the momenta and hamiltonian are the same as in
the general case. in the general case the euler equations and the canonical stress vanish identically;
however for explicit lagrangians the euler equations are the same as 8 and the canonical stress is
the same as the stress.

all partial derivatives are replaced by vector covariant derivative 1. capital letters are used for
the new quantities and small letters for the uncharged quantities. the lagrangian becomes

where e  ( + s)e. under the global transformations

(14)

the vector eld changes to w  exp(ie)w so that ww  is invariant, implying that the
lagrangian is invariant. one can choose that a = 0 and then these transformations are local.
the nother current is

j  = r(ww )r1 {i(ew  ew) + 2eea} .

one can introduce two normalization conditions

which imply

and the canonical momenta are

the last of which is surprising; because not all the components of a vanish in usual gauged scalar
electrodynamics. the stress is

note that if one starts with the electrodynamical lagrangian l = f 2/4 and tries to implement
a substitution scheme from this via a  a + kw one cannot recover the above type of charged
uids because f 2  f 2+ second derivatives in the scalar elds, which do not occur in the above.
thus there is no mirror mechanism.

4 comparison with the higgs model

to recover scalar electrodynamics rst note that

ww  = w2

 + e2a2
.

(24)

now set the state parameter r = 1, the sign parameter  = 1, and the potential q(q) = v (2)
so that

l = w2

dropping the prime gives scalar electrodynamics in radial form. this has lagrangian, stress and
