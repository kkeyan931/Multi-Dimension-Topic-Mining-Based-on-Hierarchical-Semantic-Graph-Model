abstract

we examine how a d-dimensional mass hierarchy can be generated from a d+1-dimensional
set up. we consider a d+1dimensional scalar, the hierarchon, which has a potential as
in gauged supergravities. we nd that when it is in its minimum, there exist solutions of
horava-witten topology rd  s1/z2 with domain walls at the xed points and anti-de
sitter geometry in the bulk. we show that while standard poincare supergravity leads to
power-law hierarchies, (e.g. a power law dependence of masses on the compactication
scale), gauged supergravity produce an exponential hierarchy as recently proposed by
randall and sundrum.

1 introduction

a puzzling feature in all eorts to extend the standard model (sm) is the hierarchy
mew /mp l of the electroweak scale mew  103 gev and the planck scale mp l = g1/2
n 
1018 gev. a proposal for explaining this hierarchy has been made in [1] realizing recent
ideas on the size of the compactication, the string scale and the coupling constants [2].
according to this proposal, the higher 4 + n dimensional theory with n  2 has a 4 + n
dimensional planck mass mp l(4+n) at the tev scale while the scale rc of the extra n
dimensions is less than a millimeter. the proposal has been designed in such a way as
to generate the hierarchy mew /mp l. however, it suers from another hierarchy, that of
mew rc.

in [3], an alternative scenario was proposed for generating the hierarchy without large
extra dimensions. according to this, the four-dimensional metric is not factorizable but
rather is multiplied by a warp factor with exponential dependence on a transverse coor-
dinate which has nite range. the overall space is in fact a portion of a ve-dimensional
anti-de sitter space-time (ads). masses of the four-dimensional world are also multiplied
with this warping factor which can generate hierarchies for not neseccarily compactica-
tion radius.

along these lines, we will try to push forward the idea that mass hierarchies in four
dimensions can be smoothed out in a higher-dimensional setting. we will show that
exponential hierarchy can actually be produced by a scalar in ve dimensions with a
potential like the one in gauged supergravities. we will call this scalar hierarchon for
obvious reasons. in fact it is one of the scalars which appear in gauged supergravities
and have recently been discussed in connection with the renormalization group ow
[4, 5, 6] in the context of ads/cft correspondence [7, 8, 9]. recalling that according to
the general belief, solutions of gauged supergravities are true compactications of type
iib or eleven-dimensional supergravity,1 our solutions should also corresponds to ten or
eleven-dimensional supersymmetric backgrounds.

the potential of the hierarchon is such that it has negative value at its minimum
and eectively produce a cosmological constant. in this case, there are solutions which
describe at domain walls separated by a bulk ads geometry and correspond to an
s1/z2 compactication of the radial ads coordinate. similar solutions in the context of
m-theory have been found in [11]. an induced exponential hierarchy on the walls is then
generated as in [3] which depence on the value of the potential at its critical points. in
the examples we study, exponential hierarchy is generated on one of the boundaries only
while on the other we nd a power-law hierarchy. finally, when there is no such scalar
as in the usual ungauged poincare supergravity, the hierarchy is always power-law and a
scenario with large extra dimensions should be taken as in [1].

1for the four-dimensional so(8) gauged supergravity this has been proven in [10].

2 exponential hierarchy in gauged supergravity

we will start by recalling some results from gauged-supergravity theories. these theories
exist only in d = 3, ..., 7 dimensions and they are ultimate related to the existence of
ads supergroups in these dimensions [12]. for their construction, one usual starts with
the ungauged d-dimensional poincare supergravity which, generally, contains a set of
scalars parametrizing a coset g/h and a set of (abelian) vectors ai
m transforming in
a specic representation r of g. the gauged supergravity is then obtained from the
ungauged one by gauging an appropriate non-abelian subgroup k  g. the gauge
group k is such that the decomposition of r in representations of k contains the adjoint.
the construction proceeds by replacing the abelian vectors with non-abelian ones. this
replacement clearly violates supersymmetry which, however, can be recovered by adding
terms in the action and changing appropriately the supersymmetry transformation rules.
this procedure generates a potential for the scalar elds with non-trivial critical points
which is the characteristic of gauged supergravities.

the eective action of the d = 4, 7 and d = 5 gauged supergravities can be obtained
by kk compactication of eleven-dimensional supergravity and ten-dimensional type iib
supergravity on s4, s7 and s5, respectively. since we are mainly interested in the d = 5
case, let us describe it in more details.

the toroidal compactied type iib string theory in ve dimensions has global e6(+6)
and a local usp(8) symmetry. the massless spectrum lls the n = 8 ve-dimensional
graviton multiplet which consists of a graviton, 8 gravitini, 27 vectors, 48 gauginos and 42
scalars [13]. the scalars parametrize the non-compact symmetric space e6(+6)/usp(8).
an so(6) = su(4) subgroup of e6(+6) can be gauged leading to the n = 8 gauged
supergravity [14, 15]. the potential of the latter is rather involved, it is su(4)-invariant
and all the 42 scalars appear in it except the dilaton and the axion. there is no clas-
sication of the critical points of the potential although some of the vacua are known
[5, 6, 14, 15].

turning to the general case, the symmetry group k can be broken to a subgroup
k0  k by the expectation value of a scalar  which is a k0 singlet. we will call the
scalar  which takes an expectation value hierarchon since, as we will see, it will set up
the hierarchy. the bosonic part of the gauged supergravity action for the graviton and
the hierarchon is then of the form

s =

1
22

d z ddxg(cid:18)r 

1
2

m m   v ()(cid:19) ,

(1)

where 2
d is the gravitational constant in d-dimensions. the potential v () has, generi-
cally, critical points for  = 0 = const and the value of v at these points can conveniently
be parametrized as v (0) =  (d2)(d1)
. for example, in the case of ve-dimensional
gauged supergravity, the potential for the so(5)-invariant hierarchon is

l2

v () = 

1
32

g2(cid:16)15e2 + 10e4  e10(cid:17) ,

2

(2)

where g is the gauge-coupling constant. the above potential has an su(4) symmetric
minimum at 0 = 0 where v (0) = 3g2/4 with n = 8 supersymmetry. there is also
an other minimum at 0 = 1/6 log 3 with v (0) = 35/3g2/8 with so(5) symmetry
and no supersymmetry, n = 0. similarly, if  is taken to be an su(3)  u(1) singlet,
the potential turns out to be

v () =

3
32

g2(cid:16)cosh(4)4  4 cosh(4)  5(cid:17) .

(3)

here, the su(3)  u(1)-symmetric minimum exist at 0 = 1/4 cosh1 2 with v (0) =
27/32g2 [16]. the above potentials have been employed in [4] for the discussion of the
renormalization-group ow in the ads/cf t correspondence.

having frozen the hierarchon eld at its minimum, the rest of the eld equations are

simply

rm n = 

d  1
l2 gm n .

the supersymmetry transformations for the gravitino take the form

m = m  

1
2l

im  .

(4)

(5)

the obvious solution to the above equations is the anti-de sitter space adsd which is
the unique maximally symmetric space with negative cosmological constant. it is found
as the vacuum solutions of gauged supergravity for d = 7, 5, 4 and describe m-theory
vacua on ads4,7  s7,4 and type iib on ads5  s5. they are also realized as the near-
horizon limit of various brane-congurations [17] and they are the supergravity duals of
superconformal eld theories [7, 8, 9]. the isometry group of adsd spaces are so(2, d1)
which is the conformal group in d1 dimensions. however, here we will describe solutions
to the eld equations (4) which are not maximally symmetric but rather invariant under
the group iso(1, d  2)  u(1) where iso(1, d  2) is the poincare group in d  1
dimensions. the ansatz for the d-dimensional metric is then of the form

ds2 = h(z)2adxdx + h(z)2bdz2 ,

(6)

where h(z) is a function of the transverse coordinate z. the constants a, b can be
determined by demanding supersymmetry, that is the solution to be annihilated by the
supercharges. this is equivalent to the vanishing of all fermionic shifts. the integrability
condition m = 0 turns out to be

rm n abab =

2
l2 m n  .

(7)

for the metric in (6), the integrability condition gives that a2 = 1, b = 1. moreover,
h(z) is a harmonic function in the transverse z-direction, i.e., it satises

h  = 0

with h 2 = 1/l2 ,

(8)

3

where the prime () denotes dierentiation d/dz. for a = 1 the solution turns out then
to be

ds2 = h 2dxdx + h 2dz2 ,

h =

1
l

z + c .

(9)

(10)

we will not consider the case a = 1 since it is a coordinate transformation of the a = 1
case. clearly the metric above describes a space-time invariant under the poincare group
iso(1, d  2) in the longitudinal d 1 dimensions. in fact, if h(z) is continuous, the
symmetry is so(2, d  1) since the metric (9) describes a d-dimensional anti-de sitter
space. on the other hand, if h(z) is piecewise continuous, it describes domain walls sited
at the discontinuous points. such solutions have been discussed in [18, 19, 20, 21, 22].
another possibility is to consider the case in which, h(z) is piecewise continuous and
periodic 2. among many possibilities, we will discuss two particular cases as depicted in
gure 1 which solves (8).

h(z)

(b)

figure 1: the function h(z) for 0  z < 2l.

we will examine the two cases (a) and (b) separately.

the (a) case

here, h(z) is of the form

h(z) = 


1
l z + c
 1
l z + c

0  z < l
l  z < 2l

(11)

h(z) is discontinuous but nevertheless it has the right properties, namely it is periodic
with period 2l as can easily be seen in its fourier-series representation

h(z) =

1
2

+ c 

4

2 xn=1,3,5,

1

n2 cos(cid:18)nz

l (cid:19) ,

(12)

and satises the second equation in (8) everywhere while the rst in (8) almost every-
where. by recalling the series representation of the -function

(z) =

1
2l

+

1
l



xn=1

cos(cid:18)nz

l (cid:19) ,

(13)

2we thank l. alvarez-gaume for pointing out this possibility

4

we nd that

h  =

2

l (cid:18)(z)  (z + l)(cid:19) ,

(14)

and thus the discontinuity of h(z) can be attributed to sources at the discontinuous
points. the form of the sources can be found by considering the energy-momentum
tensor tm n which in our case is given by

tm n =

1
2

d  rm n 

1
2

gm n r 

(d  2)(d  1)

2l2

gm n! .

(15)

then, it is straightforward to verify that for the metric (9) the energy-momentum tensor
is given by

so that, by using (14)

t =

d2
2
d

h  h 3  ,

tzz = 0 ,

t =

2(d2)
l2

d (cid:18)(z)  (z + l)(cid:19) h 3  .

(16)

(17)

thus, our solution describes two domain walls placed at z = 0 and z = l, respectively.
in particular, the solution is invariant under z  2l  z as can be seen from (12) and
there exist two xed points, the z = 0 and z = l. these are the points where our domain
walls are sited. in this case we may restrict z to be in the interval [0, l] corresponding
to an s1/z2 orbifold of the transverse one-dimensional space. a similar solution has also
been found in [11] in the context of m-theory where z is identied with the eleventh
dimension.

the constant c in h(z) is determined in terms of the compactication radius rc and

the cosmological constant l. from (9) we see that the compactication radius is

rc =

so that we get

1

0

ln(cid:18)1 +

l


h 1dz =

 z l
c = (cid:16)erc/l  1(cid:17)1

1

c(cid:19) ,

(18)

(19)

let us now suppose that gauge theories live on the domain walls found above while
gravity propagates in the bulk. then for the case (a) in gure 1, we see from (9) that
the masses m in the d-dimensional theory as measured from the domain wall at metric
 at z = 0 and z = l, respectively, are

m0 = h(0)m = (cid:16)erc/l  1(cid:17)1
erc/l  1!1
ml = h(l)m0 =   erc/l

m ,

m ,

since h(0) = c and h(l) = c + 1. for rc > l/ we nd that

m0  e

rc

l m , ml  m .

5

(20)

(21)

(22)

thus, while at z = l masses as measured in the full d-dimensional metric and the wall
at metric are of the same order, they are exponentially suppressed at z = 0. as a result,
we get exponential hierarchy in one boundary as in [3].

the (b) case

let us now discuss the second example (b) in gure 1 for the function h(z). here,

h(z) is

h(z) = c +

8

2 xn=1,3,5,

(1)(n1)/2

n2

sin(cid:18)nz

l (cid:19) ,

(23)

which is again periodic with period 2l. by using (13), it is straightforward to verify that

)  (z +
and that the energy-momentum tensor is in this case

h  =

4

l (cid:18)(z +

l
2

3l
2

)(cid:19) ,

t =

4(d2)
l2

d (cid:18)(z +

l
2

)  (z +

3l
2

)(cid:19) h 3  .

(24)

(25)

thus, again the solution (23) describes two domain walls placed at z = l/2, 3l/2 re-
spectively. the constant c can also be determined in terms of the cosmological constant
 1/l2 and the compactication radius rc which in this case is found to be

rc =

l

2 z 2l

0

h 1dz =

l
2

ln(cid:18)c + 1
c  1(cid:19) .

then we nd from (26) that c is given in this case by

c =

e2rc/l + 1
e2rc/l  1

.

(26)

(27)

similarly to the case (a), we nd that masses ml/2 and m3l/2 measured with the at
 metric at the domain walls in z = l/2 and z = 3l/2, respectively are related to the
mass m measured with the metric (9) by

ml/2 =   2e2rc/l

e2rc/l  1!1

m , m3l/2 = (cid:18)

2

e2rc/l  1(cid:19)1

m .

thus, again for rc > l/2 we get

ml/2  m , m3l/2  e 2rc

l m ,

(28)

(29)

so that we have exponential hierarchy in one of the boundaries. this seems to suggest
that this type of behaviour, i.e., exponential hierarchy at one of the two boundaries is
universal.

3 power-law hierarchies in ungauged supergravity

let us now turn to standard supergravity in which there exist p-brane solutions involving
the metric gm n , the dilaton  and an antisymmetric form eld strength of rang n. the
p-brane is a charged object with electric charge if p = n  2 and in this case the p-brane
is elementary. if p = d  n  2, where d is the space-time dimensions, the p-brane has
magnetic charge and it is solitonic. in the latter case we may also have n = 0 which
means that there is no antisymmetric eld strength but rather a cosmological-type term
the bosonic part of the supergravity action is then [18, 19]

s =

1
22

d z ddxg(cid:18)r 

1
2

m m  

2

l2

e(cid:19) ,

(30)

where  = 2  2(d  1)/(d  2). the action (30) admits solitonic d  2-brane solution
of the form

ds2 = h

4

(d2) dxdx + h

4(d1)

(d2) dz2 ,

e = h

2

 ,

(31)

(32)

where, again h = h(z) satises (8). by choosing h as in gure 1. we get a background
with two domain walls as in the gauged supergravity discussed above. for the case (a),
the compactication radius rc turns out to be

rc = z l

0

2(d1)

(d2) dz =

h

l

 (cid:16)(1 + c)2/  c/(cid:17) .

(33)

then, the masses ml/2 as measured with the boundary at metric  are related to the
masses m measured with the bulk metric (31) by ml/2 = c
(d2) m and a hierarchy may
be generated for c  1. from (33) we nd then

2(cid:19)

ml/2  (cid:18)rc
l 

(34)

2

2

(d2)

m

i.e., a power-law hierarchy. this is a general feature in this kind of solutions, namely, the
 6= case, which corresponds to domain wall solution in standard poincare supergravity,
always leads to power-law hierarchy since the constant c is a power of the compactication
radius rc. on the other hand, in gauged supergravities we may have  = 0 leading to
an exponential dependence of c on rc and consequently to exponential hierarchies as
explained in the previous section.

acknowledgement: we would like to thank l. alvarez-gaume, e. kiritsis, a. riotto
and a. zaaroni for discussions.

note added: while this work was in its nal stage, we received [23] where backgrounds
which realize exponential hierarchy was also constructed.
