abstract

we formulate a superspace eld theory which is shown to be equivalent

to the c  c symmetric brs/anti-brs invariant yang-mills action. the the-
ory uses a 6-dimensional superspace and one osp(3, 1|2) vector multiplet of
unconstrained superelds. we establish a superspace wt identity and show

that the formulation has an asymptotic osp(3, 1|2) invariance as the gauge
parameter goes to innity. we give a physical interpretation of this asymp-

totic osp(3, 1|2) invariance as a symmetry transformation among the longi-
tudinal/time like degrees of freedom of a and the ghost degrees of freedom.

i. introduction

non-abelian gauge theories are endowed with local gauge invariance [1]. local gauge in-

variance leads to relations between greens functions of gauge and or ghost elds collectively

denoted by wt identities [2]. formulation of gauge theories in covariant gauges necessities

inclusion of unphysical degrees of freedom corresponding to the longitudinal and the time

like gauge elds. unitarity of s-matrix (whenever dened ) requires that these modes do

not contribute to the intermediate states in the cutting equations [3]. the contributions

from such intermediate states are canceled by contributions from diagrams containing ghost

intermediate states. this is demonstrated in gauge theories with the use of the ( on-shell)

wt identities.

thus the cancellation of intermediate states coming from longitudinal /time like gauge

degrees of freedom and the ghost degrees of freedom ( we denote this set by r) together is one

of the essential consequence of wt identities. these, in turn, follow from the brs symmetry

( or gauge invariance ) [2]. this, in turn, suggests that there should be a formulation of brs

symmetry where the above set of r of degrees of freedom are explicitly linked together.

there exist many attempts to link (a, c, c) elds together.

in view of both the com-

muting and anti-commuting degrees of freedom involved, this points to a  supersymmet-

ric/superelds  formulation. a number of superspace /supereld formulation have been

written down which exhibit the brs symmetry in terms of translations or rotations in

superspace [4,5]. for a brief summary of superspace /superelds formulations and their

comparison see comments in ref. [6] and references therein.

the superspace formulation of ref. [7] constructed superelds a(x, , ), c(x, , ) and
c(x, , ) by hand by ascribing the values of the additional components (a, a    etc) equal
to the brs/anti-brs variations [8] of these. they exhibited the brs/anti-brs structure

thereby. however as the structure of the superelds was restricted there one could not con-

struct a full-edged eld theory of these superelds. the works of references [5] and [9] (and

subsequent works ) attempted to constructed a eld theory of superelds in superspace.

2

here the superelds were entirely unconstrained and the superrotations could be carried out

in the formulation. in fact the brs and anti-brs were identied with these superrotations

and the corresponding wt identities understood as arising from these. [9]. these construc-

tions had a broken osp(3, 1|2) symmetry. while these superspace formulation exhibited the
brs/anti-brs structure [10,9] , and the renormalization properties [11] of gauge theories

compactly and correctly. they treated the anti-ghost eld asymmetrically ( and as far as we

know it is necessary to do this, to exhibit the renormalization properties in linear gauges.

moreover, the underlying osp(3, 1|2) symmetry was broken one.

following the motivations outlined earlier, we have attempted, in this work, a formulation

that (i) is a superspace eld theories as in ref. [5] (ii) treats gauge, ghost and anti-ghost elds

together in one single supermultiplet. (iii)has an underlying formal osp(3, 1|2) symmetry
as the basis of construction as a limiting symmetry of the lagrange density. (iv)has wt

identities that formally imply that this symmetry becomes exact as gauge parameter  
in fact we nd
 (v) corresponds to the yang-mills theory in one of its formulation.
that the superspace formulation presented here corresponds to the brs/anti-brs invariant

formulation of baulieu and thierry-mieg [8] with  = 1 ( c, c symmetric case).

we interpret heuristically the last property in the following manner. we note ( as done

in sec. iic) that as    the gauge boson propagator is dominated by the longitudinal
and time like modes. thus in this limit, the multiplet (a, c, c) is dominated by just the set

r of extra modes which enter the unitarity discussion via wt identities . it is precisely in

this limit, the osp(3, 1|2) symmetry is becoming exact.

we now briey present the plan of the paper. in sec ii, we shall review the underlying

superspace /supereld structure and the osp group properties. we briey discuss the

brs/anti-brs symmetric formulation of reference [8] . we also include a brief discussion

on the mode structure of propagator as   . in section iii, we present the superspace
formulation and show its equivalence to the brs/anti-brs symmetric formulation with

 = 1 [8]. in this section iv, we show that the generating functional w [ x] is asymptotically

(  ) invariant under the osp(3, 1|2) group. in sec v, we elaborate on the physical

3

meaning of the result so obtained.

ii. preliminary

a. brs/anti-brs symmetric action

in this section, we shall review the known results on brs and anti-brs symmetries of

eective action in gauge theories [8].

we consider the most general eective action in linear gauges given by baulieu and

thierry - mieg [8] that has brs/anti-brs invariance, when expressed entirely in terms of

necessary elds a, c, c (and no auxiliary elds)

here we are assuming a yang- mills theory with a simple gauge group and introducing

the following notations:

lie algebra:

[t , t ] = if t 

covariant derivative: (dc)  d

 c = ( + gf a

)c

f  are totally antisymmetric. note here we have changed the convention for the covari-

ant derivative just to bring it in line with notations of ref. [5]. this action has the global

symmetries under the following transformations

(2.5)

in the anti-brs transformations the role of c and c are interchanged in addition to change

in some coecients. note that  = 0 case yields the usual faddeev- popov action and  = 1

yields an action symmetric in c and c.

b. superspace, superelds and invariants

we shall work in superspace formulation of yang-mills theory given in ref. [5], which we

briey review in this section. the superspace formulation uses an underlying six-dimensional

superspace described by superspace coordinate xi  (x, , ) with ,  are real grassman-
nian variables. superelds and supersources are function of superspace coordinates. the

superspace is endowed with a metric gij , with only non zero components

g00 = g11 = g22 = g33 = g45 = g54 = 1

(2.6)

the innitesimal orthosymplectric coordinate transformations which leaves the norm of the

supervector, xigjixj invariant are consists of (i) six lorentz transformations which leaves

gxx invariant. (ii) three simplectic transformations which leaves  invariant and char-

acterized by three innitesimal parameter. (iii) and eight susy transformations given by

x = x + a + b

5

 =  + xb

 =   xa

(2.7)

[where ,  are arbitrary four vectors and a, b are real innitesimal grassmannians] gen-

erated by s4 and s5. s4 generates transformations with  = 0 and s5 generates trans-

formations with  = 0.


xi

are transforms as a covariant vector under the osp(3, 1|2)

transformations and they are give by


x =

x + a

+ a

(2.8)

and the vector superelds ai(x)  (a(x), c4(x), c5(x)) also transform as covariants vectors
under these osp(3, 1|2) transformations and given by

a
 = a + ac5  bc4
4 = c4 + aa
c

5 = c5 + ba
c

(2.9)

the transformations for the vector supersource x i(x) are such that x i(x) ai(x) remain

invariant under osp(3, 1|2)

we dene the scalar product as

a  b = aigjibj  ajbj

and the tensor invariants are dened as

a  bc  d = ciajbkdlgkjgli = tijtklgkjgli

(2.10)

(2.11)

where aibi is a commuting quantity. using the above denitions of scalar products we

construct

the

following

osp

invariant

6

quantities (i) fijfklgkjgli

(ii) i[aijaj]

(iii) i[ajjai]

(iv) i[(iaj)aj]. where the

superspace eld strength tensor, fij is dened as

c. mode structure of gauge propagator

the propagator in the linear gauges is given by

if (k, ) = i

k2 + i "g 

kk
k2 + i

(1  )#

(2.12)

(2.13)

we imagine expanding the gauge eld (in the momentum space ) in the basis consisting of

the transverse, the longitudinal and the time like degrees of freedom,

a(k) =

4

xi=1

(k)a(i)(k2)
i

with (1)

 and (2)

 (k) are transverse degrees of freedom with

(i)
0 (k) = 0 ,

~k  ~(i)(~k) = 0 i = 1, 2

and

 (k) = 

(3)

|k|
we note the orthonormality properties,

0, ~k

(4)
 = (1, 0, 0, 0)


 ;

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

(i)  (j) = ij + 2i0j0

(i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4)

(2.17)

then the gauge boson propagator

ha(k) a(k)i =

4

xi,j=1

(i)
 (k)(j)

 (k)da(i)(k2)a(j)(k2)e

we recall

 (k)(i)

 (k) = (g  00) +

kk(1  0)(1  0)

~k2

7

(2.18)

(2.19)

we then nd by comparison,

ij

k2 + i

1  i, j  2

da(i)(k2), a(j)(k2)e =
daj(k2), ai(k2)e = da(i)(k2), a(j)(k2)e = 0 1  i  2; 3  j  4
da(3)(k2), a(3)(k2)e = (  1)

(2.20)

thus we see that as   , the correlation functions of modes containing a(3) ( the longi-
tudinal ) or a(4) ( the time like ) go to , while those containing the transverse components
remain unaltered. we now scale as,

a(3) = r

a(4) = r

a4; ai  ai

i = 1, 2

(2.21)

( the factor of
h ai(k2), aj(k2)i have - independent limits. then the expansion of the gauge eld reads

is for future convenience only.)

then all correlation functions

the relation above exhibits explicitly the  factors that say that (after suitable normaliza-

tion) the longitudinal and the time like components of a general gauge eld become dominant

as   . this remark will nd application in see. v in the context of the supermultiplet
structure of elds introduced.

iii. construction of superspace action

in this section, we shall present the construction of the superspace action which is equiv-

alent to the yang-mills theory in its brs/anti-brs invariant formulation with  = 1

[ see sec.

iia]. the building block of the superspace action is a covariant vector eld

8

ai(x) = (a(x), c4(x), c5(x)) (c4 and c5 will turn out to be related to the antighost eld

c and the ghost eld c). we shall also introduce commuting contravariant vector source

x i(x) . unlike ref. [6] we don,t however need a scalar supereld and scalar supersource. as

we shall see later, the lagrange density turns out to have a graded structure as the gauge
parameter    (i) l0 is an osp invariant action of o(0) (ii) l1 turns out to be also an
osp invariant, but of o(1) and (iii) l2 is an sp(2) invariant symmetry breaking term of
o(2). explicitly1,

l0 =
l1 = ihaijaji + ihajjaii + ihajiaji
l2 =

a = 4, 5

to this we add the source terms

ls =







[ x i ai]

(3.1)

(3.2)

under osp(3, 1|2) transformations ls changes at most by a total derivative. we then

construct the generating functional

where

w [ x] = z da exp iz d4x [l0 + l1 + l2 + ls]

d a

yi=0dai(x) 

yi=0dai(x)dai,(x)dai,(x)

(3.3)

(3.4)

in order to establish the equivalence of the above generating functional with that of the

yang-mills theory, we carry out the integrations over the variables ai,, ai, explicitly as in

ref. [5]. the procedure is very straightforward and hence we shall not present the details;

1the parameter  in l1 is not to be confused with  in the brs /anti-brs invariant action of
sec. iia which will always be taken to be 1 in this work.

but only the nal result. omitting the source terms for the present ( as these are not relevant

to the equivalence ) we nd

w [ x] = z da(x)dc4(x)dc5(x) exp i [s0[a, c4, c5] + source terms]

(3.5)

comparing with eq. (2.1) , we see that s0 of (3.6) is compatible with the action in eq.

(2.1) only if

and

coecient of (f ac4)(f ac5) = 0   = 0

further, we use the freedom to dene c4 and c5 to set

either values of  would be acceptable for our purpose.

we shall see in sec. iv that the solution in (3.12) with -ve sign leads to a superspace

lagrange density that has asymptotic ( i.e. as   ) symmetry ; and hence we shall make
this choice. thus the equivalence of the two action with  and  given in terms of (3.10)

and (3.11) is established completely.

we shall, however, be particularly interested in a special case. we further use the freedom

we have in choosing the free parameter  to let 0 <   1 then,

thus, as   0+, our superspace action represents the brs/anti-brs action with the

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

( with  = 3

functional to the brs/anti-brs symmetric action with gauge parameter ( ) . in the
next section we shall establish the asymptotic osp invariance for w [ k] in other words, the

formal equation of the form

hw [ x ]  w [ x]i|x i

(3.19)

iv. osp (3, 1|2) wt identities

in this section, we shall consider the consequence of the osp(3, 12) transformations
on the source x i(x) to obtain the wt identities for the broken osp(3, 1|2) symmetry.
the result is summarized by the statement which in eect says that    w recovers
osp(3, 1|2) invariance under the conditions claried under. it is also shown how this wt
identity embodies exact brs/anti-brs symmetry in the form of the statements 4.28 and

4.29.

we begin with the generating functional

w [ x(x)] = z d a(x) exp(cid:26)iz d4xhl0[ a] + l1[ a] + l2[ a] + lsi(cid:27)

we perform an osp(3, 1|2) rotation on the sources x i

with

x i(x)  x i(x)

x i(x) = x j(1x)i

j

under this transformation, we have the invariance

x i(x)ai(x) = x i(x)a

i(x)

= x i(x)j

i aj(x)

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

[here  is dened in 2.9, in particular for s4 and s5 transformations ]. then using (4.4),

we have

z d4xls = z 





 h x i(x)ai(x)i

= z 





 h x i(x)j

i aj(x)i

(4.5)

in view of the so(3, 1) sp(2) invariance of the entire s, we expect new informations to
emerge from the transformations associated with additional supersymmetries s4 and s5.

hence we now restrict ourselves to the  of eq. (2.9) given in sec. iib. we note now that

12

(x) = (x + a + b,  + bx,   ax)

(4.6)

and express

z d4xls = z d4x






 h x i(x)j

i aj(x) +n(a + b) x i(x) +   xb x i

,    xa x i

,o ai(x)i

(4.7)

in the last term, we have used the innitesimal nature of  and  to replace x   x and
  1. further,
z d4xls( x) z d4xls( x ) = z d4x"+(a + b)

(4.8)

using (4.8) we can write down change in w [ x] under an innitesimal osp transformation

here we have dropped terms proportional to ai

, ( as these elds can be set to zero). the

double bracket, <<>> has been used to denote that the expression inside it is actually

inside the path integral.

we now evaluate w [ x] for thesupersymmetry transformations  s4 only; i.e.

set

 = 0. we, further, note that the sources  x 
composite operator involved in the anti-brs transformations . these are not required to

, are to generate the green,s functions of the

evaluate the basic green,s functions of the yang-mills theory, nor the brs wt identities.

13

hence, we evaluate (4.9) at x 

, = 0. [ the spurious terms involving  x i can also be set to

zero as x i are sources for a, which are redundant eld].

now, the rst term on the right hand side of (4.9) ( here ps goes over the sources
,; x i

,) vanishes by the translational invariance of w [ x] in x.

we organize the rest of the terms in w as

we shall simplify the expression on the right hand side employing the 6-d gauge invariance

subtracting (4.21) from (4.20) and setting x 5

, we obtain

=  << c4, + c5, >> +(2  ) << c4,  c5, >> +(  ) <<   a >>= o() (4.22)

further, using (4.17) and (4.18), we obtain ( at x i

, = 0 )




(dc5) = o()

[ we recognize in (4.19) and in (4.23)the usual brs invariance statement of 1

on account of (4.17),(4.18) and (4.22) used successively in the left hand side of (4.24) these

terms vanish at x i

, = 0. we thus conclude,

<< x 4

,aa >>=<< o() >>

(4.25)

using (4.17),(4.22),(4.18),(4.25),(4.23),(4.21),(4.19) and (4.21) in the successive terms on

the right hand side of (4.16) we obtain,

(4.26)

we could have alternatively considered the symmetry associated with s5 transforma-

tions ( 6= 0,  = 0) in (4.9). in view of the overall sp(2) symmetry of the formulation, we
will obtain the analogous relation

w [ x]|x i

,=0=x i = o(

)

(4.27)

the relations (4.26) and (4.27) are statements of formal osp(3, 1|2) symmetry as   .
these contain in them the consequences of brs and anti-brs invariance. these conse-

quences can be obtained in a manner analogous to the argument following eq. (19) of the

16

ref. [10] ( see also [12] for alternative procedure for the entire derivation). they result in

equations

these equations can also be alternatively veried evaluating w [x] along the lines of ref

[5] and evaluating w

[p r

 is the projection operator that projects away the transverse part]. we note that as
  , (5.3) refers to the transformations within the set ar only.

thus, in the limit   , the osp(3, 1|2) transformations, in particular, contain a
set of symmetry transformations among the members of the redundant set r. the wt

identities are a particular consequence of these symmetries. a special consequence of the

wt identities is the cancellation of the contributions from the set r in the intermediate

states in the unitarity relations using the cutkowsky rules [3] .

in the present superspace formulation, we have an explicit construction of a set of sym-

metry transformations amongst this set r; originating from the original osp(3, 1|2) transfor-
mation which, as we have shown, lead to wt identities in particular. thus, this formulation

can be looked upon as an explicit realization of that relationship that is expected to exist

with in the elds of the set r that is ultimately known to lead to mutual cancellations in

the cutting equations.
