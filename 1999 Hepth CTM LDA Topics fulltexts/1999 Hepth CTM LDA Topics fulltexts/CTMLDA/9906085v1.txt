we discuss the free-energy density of bosonic and fermionic theories possessing
strongly coupled critical points in d = 3. we construct a stationary renormal-
ization group trajectory which interpolates between the free massless theory of
n scalars and a class of interacting theories including both bosons and fermions.
at a special point of this trajectory the free-energy is 5/4 times the free-energy
density of the o(n ) vector model at its nontrivial critical point. our method
could in principle be useful in the study of other theories with strongly coupled
xed points, such as n = 4 sym in d = 4.

i. introduction

the recent progress in our understanding of the microscopic origin of the thermodynamic
properties of black holes has sparked a renewed interest in the investigation of conformal eld
theories (cfts) at nite temperature. there have been a number of calculations [15] regarding
the free-energy density of cfts emerging from ads/cft correspondence [68]. these are
particularly interesting, as the ads/cft correspondence probes the strong-coupling regime of
n = 4 sym4 for large-n. the free-energy obtained is found to be 3/4 times the free-energy
density of the same theory at its free-eld limit. such a result still lacks a proper understanding
since it is related to non-trivial d-dimensional conformal eld theories, where d > 2, which
are not well understood.

it has also been suggested in [9], following earlier work of [1014], that the free-energy density
at criticality encodes important information for the rg-ow between dierent xed points.1 in
particular, it has been claimed in [9] that studies of the free-energy density yield constraints
regarding the low-energy spectrum of theories undergoing symmetry-breaking transitions.

to get more insight into the signicance of the free-energy density at criticality, we elaborate
here on some remarkable results regarding the three-dimensional o(n) vector model and its
fermionic counterpart, the gross-neveu model. these models have non-trivial critical points
at large-n which are strongly coupled and represent a symmetry-breaking transition, making
them important testing ground. a remarkable result is then that the leading-n free-energy
density of the bosonic theory at its non-trivial critical point is 4/5 times the free-energy density
of the theory of n massless free scalars [12].

our purpose here is to provide some physical insight into the origin of this simple relationship
between the two critical points. to this end, we construct a theory of coupled bosonic and
fermionic elds. then, on the space of couplings we identify a stationary renormalization group
(rg) trajectory which interpolates between the free massless theory of n scalars and a class
of interactive critical theories. the free-energy along this trajectory does not change.
its
value remains equal to the free-energy of the theory of n massless free scalars. this is one
end of the trajectory, where only one o(n) massless eld contributes. we then nd a point
on the trajectory which is simply related to the non-trivial xed point of the o(n) vector
model, providing a physical interpretation for the apparent reduction of the massless degrees
of freedom coupled to the latter. to summarize our result, at that special point on the rg
trajectory two of the elds roll to the non-trivial critical point of the o(n) vector model and
the other massive elds do not contribute. the two elds that contribute at that point are
o(n) and o(n/4) scalar elds, respectively. thus eectively, they contribute 1 + 1/4 = 5/4
degrees of freedom. this explains why the free-energy density at the non-trivial critical point
is 4/5 times the free-energy density of the free theory of n massless free scalars.

our method is quite general and could in principle be used to studying other theories which

have strongly coupled critical points, such as n = 4 sym4 in the large-n limit.

we organize our discussion as follows. in section ii, we introduce the free-energy density and
briey discuss its properties. in section iii, we review the salient features of the o(n) vector
model as well as the fermionic gross-neveu model. section iv contains our main calculation.
we construct an interactive eld theory in three dimensions, making use of the models in
section iii. we show that this theory possesses stationary rg-ow trajectories along which
the free-energy does not change. we identify a point on one of the trajectories whose free-energy
is manifestly 5/4 times the free-energy of the non-trivial critical point of the o(n) vector model.
finally, in section v, we present our conclusions.

ii. general remarks on the free-energy density

consider a euclidean eld theory in s1  rd1 geometry with periodic boundary conditions.
such a theory is related to a d-dimensional statistical mechanical system in thermal equilibrium,
as the lattice spacing a  0. the free-energy density (free-energy per unit volume), for the
latter system can be written as [11]

f (l, g, a) = f0(g, a) 

1
ld c(l, g, a)

(1)

where the temperature is t = 1/l and g denotes collectively the bare coupling constants. the
term f0 is the free-energy density at zero temperature, or equivalently the bulk free-energy
density.

under the basic assumption that in the limit a  0 the statistical mechanical system is
described by a renormalizable qft, uv renormalization of f0 suces to render eq. (1) nite.
furthermore, one can write

c(l, g, a)  cr(gr, l)

(2)

where gr are dimensionless coupling constants and  is the mass scale at the arbitrary subtrac-
tion point. the subscript r denotes the renormalized quantities. if we introduce the rg scale
t = l, then cr(gr, t) obeys the rg equation denoting the independence of physical quantities
on  (we drop the r subscript since we shall henceforth deal only with renormalized physical
quantities) [11]

 t


t

+ (g)



g! c(g, t) = 0

(g) = t

g(t)

t

(3)

(4)

from eq. (3), we deduce that c(g, t) does not change along rg stationary trajectories with

(g) = 0

2

(5)

the quantity c(g, t) carries information for all the degrees of freedom coupled to the theory at
a certain rg-scale, as it is intimately related with the energy momentum tensor. consider a
system in a slab of length l with partition function

zl = z d esl() = ef (l)

where f (l) is the free-energy normalized so that

under the coordinate change,

f () = 0

x  x + (x) , (x) = (cid:20) (cid:18)1 +

l

l (cid:19) x0,

x(cid:21) , x = (x1, .., xd1)

we have

sl  sl +

l

l zslab

ddx t00(x)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

if the partition function is at a xed point of the rg, it remains invariant under such a change.
this gives to leading order in l

zl = ef (l) = ef (l)l f

l  l

l rslab

ddxht00(x)i

(10)

which gives the change of the free-energy in terms of the t00-component of the energy momen-
tum tensor as [10]

l

f
l

= zslab

ddxht00(x)i

using eq. (1), we then obtain

ht00i = (1  d)

c(g, t)

ld +

1
ld (g)

c(g, t)

(11)

(12)

relations such as eq. (12), acquire their full power in two dimensions where they lead to the
important result that c(g, t) at a critical point is proportional to the central charge of the
corresponding cft.

iii. critical bosonic and fermionic theories in d = 3

in this section, we review o(n) bosonic and u(n) fermionic models in the large-n limit.

3

a. the o(n ) vector model

the lagrangian density for the o(n) bosonic vector model is

l =

1
2

~   ~ + v (|~|)

(13)

where ~(x) = a(x), a = 1, 2, .., n is the o(n)-vector scalar eld, and v (|~|) is an interaction
potential whose explicit form is not important for our purposes. the partition function in the
large-n limit exhibits a universal behavior. this has been studied in the case when

v (|~|) = (~  ~)2

and also when the vector eld is constrained by
~  ~ = 1

(14)

(15)

in the latter case, the lagrangian density may be written in terms of an auxiliary scalar eld
 as

l =

1
2

~  (2 + )~ +

n
2g



(16)

this theory possesses a non-trivial critical point at each order in a 1/n expansion, as the
coupling g is kept xed [16,17]. this critical point is uv-stable, corresponds to a non-trivial
three-dimensional cft and represents the o(n)  o(n  1) symmetry breaking transition.
the critical theory is strongly coupled, since the 1/n expansion corresponds to a resummation
of an innite number of diagrams.

in the spirit of the suggestion in [9], we can measure the massless degrees of freedom coupled
to a critical theory if we heat it up to a temperature t = 1/l where we impose periodic
boundary conditions along euclidean time. this is equivalent to placing the theory in a slab
with one nite dimension of length l playing the role of inverse temperature. then, when the
o(n) vector model coupling stays at its zero temperature critical value g, (this is sometimes
referred to as the nite-size scaling regime [18]), one obtains the remarkable result [12]

is the leading-n solution of the gap equation. the simplicity of this result (eq. (17)) is due to
some remarkable identities for the dilogarithm and the trilogarithm at the special point eq. (18)
[19] [see appendix].

as the free-energy density of a theory of n massless free scalars is

c0(g0)

n

=

(3)
2l3

(19)

we conclude from eqs. (17) and (19) that, for large-n, the number of massless degrees of
freedom coupled to the non-trivial xed-point of the o(n) vector models, is 4/5 times the
massless degrees of freedom coupled to the free-eld theory xed-point.

the strongly coupled critical theory is not related in an entirely obvious way to the free-eld
theory of n massless scalars. nevertheless, it has been argued [16] that the critical uv-stable
xed point of the o(n) vector model is in the same universality class with the ir-stable xed
point of the o(n) invariant 4 theory in 2 < d < 4. such a correspondence is only valid at the
critical regime when one can disregard an innite number of irrelevant operators. therefore,
the rg-ow from the free-eld theory of n massless bosons, (corresponding to the uv-stable
xed point of the o(n) invariant 4 theory), to the ir-stable xed point is non-perturbative.
this means essentially that had we been able to obtain the full solution of the rg-equations,
the massless free theory would correspond to the weak-coupling limit and the non-trivial critical
theory eq. (17) to the strong coupling limit.

b. the u (n ) gross-neveu model

another three-dimensional theory with a strongly coupled xed point is the u(n) gross-

neveu model [16,17]. its lagrangian is written is terms of an auxiliary scalar eld  as

l =  ( + ) +

n
2g

2

(20)

where  = 1, 2, .., n 2 this theory has a uv-stable critical point at each order in the 1/n
expansion as the coupling g is kept xed. this critical point represents a space-parity breaking
transition.

placing the theory in a slab with one nite dimension of length l amounts to imposing an-
tiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions along euclidean time. then, when the coupling
stays at its bulk critical value g the gap equation gives zero expectation value for . this is a
consequence of the absence of zero modes for fermions and antiperiodic boundary conditions.
it essentially means that c(g) for this model is given by the free-eld theory result [20] and
not by a complicated relation involving polylogarithms such as eq. (17). therefore, for some

2for the euclidean three-dimensional gamma matrices we use the hermitian two-dimensional repre-
sentation 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3  0 = 3, with i, i = 1, 2, 3 the usual pauli matrices.

5

time its was thought that nothing interesting happens in three-dimensional fermionic models
at the nite-size scaling regime.

however, it was recently discovered [21,14] that certain three-dimensional fermionic models
do exhibit non-trivial behavior in the nite-size scaling regime. the theory discussed in [14]
is the u(n) gross-neveu model for xed total fermion number b. the xed fermion number
constraint is introduced into the theory via a delta function ( n  b), where

n = z d2x(x)(x) ,

x = (x1, x2)

(21)

is the fermion number operator. using an auxiliary scalar eld (x3) to impose the delta
function constraint, the action for this model is written in the slab geometry

s = zslab

( + i3 + ) +

n

2g zslab

2 + ibzslab



(22)

it was shown in [14] that for certain values of  the gap equation of the model yields a non-zero
expectation value for  when the coupling stays at the bulk critical value g. consequently,
c(g) is no longer given by the free eld theory result but by a non-trivial expression involving
polylogarithms as

c(g)

n

l3 hln(cid:16)elhi(cid:17) li2(cid:16)elhi, lhi(cid:17)  li3(cid:16)elhi, lhi(cid:17)i

(23)

(24)

where lin(r, ) is the real part of the polylogarithm lin(rei) and cln() is clausens function
[19]. an important observation of [14] is that for lhi =  the fermions acquire periodic bound-
ary conditions and the theory resembles the bosonic o(n) vector model discussed previously.
in this case the expectation value of  is given by

and, from eq. (23), the free-energy is

i.e., minus twice the free-energy density of the o(n) vector model. the interpretation of a
negative free-energy density may not be clear when one considers the model above by itself. it
is entirely justiable, however, when the model is viewed as part of a larger theory containing
both fermions and bosons as we discuss in the next section.

6

iv. stationary rg-trajectories and the free-energy density

the models described in section iii are typical examples of strong-coupling dynamics in
qft. the low-energy critical theory is unreachable by a weak coupling expansion around the
uv-critical point and one needs to know the full analytic dependence of physical quantities on
the coupling constant to study both regimes. most importantly, the spectrum of the theory
changes in an uncontrollable way.

to understand the dierence between the massless degrees of freedom coupled to the dierent
critical regimes of the o(n) model, we shall exploit the following idea. we shall construct
stationary rg-ows which interpolate between critical theories with dierent eld contents,
one of which is the free-eld theory of n massless scalars. since the free-energy density remains
invariant along stationary rg-ows, all such theories will have the same free-energy density
eq. (19). these theories may be interpreted as interacting theories of massive scalar elds,
however they may not necessarily be physical, i.e., some of the masses may be negative. then,
the condition for stationary free-energy density implies denite relations between the masses.
for a set of special values of the masses, the resulting theory is seen to be related to the strongly
coupled critical theory eq. (17).

consider a theory in three dimensions with two o(n) bosonic elds, 1 and 2, one o(n/4)
bosonic eld  and a u(n) fermionic eld . these elds have masses m1, m2, m3, m4,
respectively. the quadratic part of the lagrangian density reads

l0 =

1

2 h1

1 (2 + m2

1)1

1 + 2

2 (2 + m2

2)2

2 + 3(2 + m2

3)3i  4( + m4)4

(27)

where 1, 2, 4 = 1, 2, .., n, 3 = 1, 2, .., n/4. these elds interact, but we will not specify the
interaction lagrangian. furthermore, we may impose a xed total fermion number constraint
as it was discussed in section iii. this is quite natural since the total fermion number constraint
is equivalent to the presence of a background gauge eld [22,23]. hence, the theory in eq. (27)
may be viewed as a three-dimensional massive gauge theory with bosons and fermions. the
full lagrangian density is

l = l0 + v12(~1 , ~2) + v3(|~|) + v4( , )

notice that only the two o(n) bosonic elds interact with each other.

each eld has free-energy in the saddle point approximation

f (i) =

ni
2

tr ln(2 + m2
i ) ,

i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

where n1 = n2 = 4n3 = n4 = n. the total free-energy of the system is

f =

4

xi=1

if (i)

7

(28)

(29)

(30)

where i = +1 (1) for a boson (fermion). in the slab geometry bosons acquire periodic bound-
ary conditions along the nite dimension p0 = 2n/l, n = 0,1,2, . . .. furthermore, due to
the total fermion number constraint [14], or equivalently due to the some special conguration
of the background gauge eld [23], we can arrange so that fermions acquire periodic boundary
conditions as well. using then the identity

ln(2

n + |~p|2 + m2) = 2 ln(cid:18)1  el|~p|2+m2(cid:19) + lz dp0

2

we obtain

i(cid:19) +

2 z

d3p
(2)3 ln(p2 + m2
i )

(32)

this expression is divergent. we will subtract the uv divergence `a la bogoliubov. to this end,
we expand

ln(p2 + m2

i ) = ln p2 +

m2
p2 + o(m4
i
i )

and replace

ln(p2 + m2

i )  ln(p2 + m2

i )  ln p2 

m2

the resulting expression is nite and given by

6

(mil)3

(33)

(34)

(35)

corrections to this expression may come from the interactive part of the lagrangian eq. (28)
and are in general polynomials in the masses. as long as we are interested in stationary rg-
trajectories, we will consider only marginal couplings which are trinomials in the masses. we
will add appropriate trinomials to obtain a free-energy which is renormalization group invariant.
pick a rg trajectory ((g) = 0) parametrized by t. along this trajectory, we demand that

we obtain

which is the result of non-trivial polylogarithm identities [see appendix].

(39)

(40)

next, we discuss the behavior of the theory along the rg trajectory. the ow of the masses
is shown in fig. 1. to consider theories with real masses, the rg-parameter t must be restricted
to 0  t  1. for non-negative masses, we need
0  t 

(41)

1
2

as t  0, we have x1, x3, x4  0, so m1, m3, m4   and all elds except for the second boson
decouple. the second boson has x2  1 so m2  0. therefore

c = c(0) = li3(1)

(42)

and the free theory of n massless bosons is in the class of theories connected with the above
stationary rg-ow.

for 1

2 < t < 1, some masses become negative. as t  1, m1  0, m2   and m3, m4 
. this means again that only one (m1) boson is coupled at the critical point, as it should,
and the other three elds decouple, albeit the last two with negative masses.
2 at which two pairs of masses converge

there is an interesting point in the interval 0  t  1

to the same value, respectively. let  be the golden mean

at t = 1/ 2 = 2   , we have

x1 = t = 2  

,

x2 =   1 ,

x3 = 2  

,

x4 =

at this point, eq. (36) becomes

6

ln3(2   )(cid:19)

in view of eq. (45) above, we see that the non-trivial critical point of the the o(n) vector
model (see section iii) is related to one of the massive theories which lie along the stationary
rg-trajectory of eqs (36) and (37). therefore, an interacting critical theory with masses as in
eq. (39) has 5/4 times the free-energy density of the non-trivial xed point of the o(n) vector
model.

v. discussion and outlook

in this work, we addressed the issue of non-perturbatice rg ows connecting weakly and
strongly coupled xed-points of three-dimensional qfts. a quantity which encodes important
information for such xed point is the free-energy density. we briey discussed some of its
properties in section iii and analyzed some old [12], and more recent [14] exact results for the
free-energy density of non-trivial, strongly coupled three-dimensional cfts in section iv. we
presented our main result in section v, where we provided an explicit example of a stationary
rg-trajectory interpolating between a class of critical three-dimensional qfts. the crucial
observation is that the interactive critical theory corresponding to a special point of the tra-
jectory is related to the non-trivial critical point of the three-dimensional o(n) vector model.
this way, we provided a physical picture for the fact that the latter critical theory seems to
involve 4/5 times massless degrees of freedom than the free-eld theory of n massless scalars.
in obtaining the stationary rg-trajectory of eqs. (36) and (40) it was essential that the
fermions in the lagrangian eq. (27) acquire periodic boundary conditions. this is not unusual
for fermions in gauge eld backgrounds, as the zeroth component of the gauge eld plays the
role of an imaginary chemical potential. therefore, it is possible that for certain congurations
of the background gauge eld the fermions acquire a zero mode and are eectively bozonized
contributing, however, a negative free-energy density [14,23]. although the issue regarding the
physical interpretation of such a bosonization is not clearly settled as yet [24], we have explicitly
demonstrated its relevance to studies of non-perturbative rg ows.

our approach to studying the free-energy density of critical theories connected via non-
perturbative rg-ows could in principle be applied to other interesting cases, such as the
n = 4 sym4. such an extension is expected to be more complicated, as the corresponding
formulae for the free-energy density of massive four-dimensional theories involve innite sums
of polylogarithms [25]. a further complication comes from the fact that the beta-function of
n = 4 sym4 is identically zero. therefore, neither the rg equation eq. (3), nor any kind of
weak-coupling expansion are sucient to studying the coupling constant dependence of c(g, t).
in this respect, all eorts towards understanding the non-perturbative nature of n = 4 sym4
are worthwhile.

appendix

here we present certain polylogarithm identities which we used in order to derive various

results earlier. for more details see [19].

the nth-order polylogarithm is dened by

lin(x) =

xk
kn

n

xk=1

we have lin(1) = (n).

the dilogarithm obeys the following identities:

li2(x) + li2(1  x) = li2(1)  ln x ln(1  x)

li2(x) + li2(x) =

1
2

li2(x2)

li2(x) + li2(cid:18) x

1  x(cid:19) = 

1
2

ln2(1  x)

the golden mean plays a special role in these identities. let  = 1+5
rst two identities (eqs. (a-2) and (a-3)), we obtain

2

(a-1)

(a-2)

(a-3)

(a-4)

. setting x = 1/ in the

3
2

li2(1/ 2)  li2(1/ ) = li2(1) 

1
2

ln  2

(a-5)

where we used  2    1 = 0. setting x = 1/ 2 in the third identity (eq. (a-4)), we obtain

li2(1/ 2)  li2(1/ ) = 

1
8

ln2  2

combining eqs. (a-5) and (a-6), we nally obtain

li2(1/ 2) =

2
5

li2(1) 

1
4

ln2  2

(a-6)

(a-7)

i.e., the dilogarithm can be expressed in terms of elementary functions at the special point
x = 1/ 2.

similarly, for the trilogarithm, the following identities hold:

li3(x) + li3(1  x) + li3(cid:18) x

1  x(cid:19) = li3(1) + li2(1) ln(1  x) 

1
2

ln x ln2(1  x) +

li3(x) + li3(x) =

1
4

li3(x2)

11

1
6

ln3(1  x)
(a-8)

(a-9)

again, the golden mean plays a special role. to see this, set x = 1/ 2 in the rst identity
(eq. (a-8))

li3(1/ 2) + li3(1/ ) + li3(1/ ) = li3(1) +

1
2

li2(1) ln  2 

5
48

ln3  2

using the second identity (eq. (a-9)), we obtain

li3(1/ 2) =

4
5

li3(1) 

2
5

li2(1) ln  2 

1
12

ln3  2

which, in view of eq. (a-7), can be written as

li3(1/ 2) + li2(1/ 2) ln  2 

1
6

ln3  2 =

4
5

li3(1)

introducing the function

f (x) = li3(x)  li2(x) ln x +

1
6

ln3 x

we can write eq. (a-12) as (cf. eq. (17))

f (1/ 2) =

4
5 f (1) =

4
5

(3)

(a-10)

(a-11)

(a-12)

(a-13)

(a-14)

to show that the function eq. (36) is invariant under the ow eq. (39), set x = t in eq. (a-8)
and x = t

1t in eq. (a-9). combining the two equations, we obtain
1
2

li3(x3)  li3(x4) = li3(1) + li2(1) ln x2 

ln x1 ln2 x2 +

li3(x1) + li3(x2) +

1
4

where the xi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are given by eq. (39). dene (cf. eq. (37))

v(x1, x2) =

1
3

ln3 x1 

1
2

ln2 x1 ln x2 

1
2

ln x1 ln2 x2 +

1
3

ln3 x2

after some algebra, we obtain

c = f (x1) + f (x2) +

1
4f (x3)  f (x4)  v(x1, x2) = li3(1)

which implies stationary ow (cf. eq. (40)),

dc
dt

= 0.
