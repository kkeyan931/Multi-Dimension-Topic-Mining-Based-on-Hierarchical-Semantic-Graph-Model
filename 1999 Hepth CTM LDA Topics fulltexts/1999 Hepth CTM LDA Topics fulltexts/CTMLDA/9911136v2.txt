abstract

we examine noncommutative solutions of the nonabelian theory on the world-volume of n
coincident d-strings. these solutions can be interpreted in terms of noncommutative geome-
try as funnels describing the nonabelian d-string expanding out into an orthogonal d3-brane.
these congurations are dual to the bion solutions in the abelian world-volume theory of the
d3-brane. in the latter, a charge n magnetic monopole describes n d-strings attached to the
d3-brane with a spike deformation of the world-volume. the noncommutative d-string solu-
tions give a reliable account of physics at the core of the monopole, where the bion description
is expected to breakdown. in the large n limit, we nd good agreement between the two points
of view, including the energy, couplings to background elds, and the shape of the funnel. we
also study uctuations traveling along the d-string, again obtaining agreement in the large n
limit. at nite n, our results give a limit on the number of modes that can travel to innity
along the n d-strings attached to the d3-brane.

1 introduction

d-branes [1, 2, 3] have become important tools in the quest to develop a full understanding
of string theory. the low energy action describing the dynamics of test d-branes consists of
two parts: the born-infeld action [4] and the chern-simons action [5, 6]. this nonlinear action
reliably captures the physics of d-branes with great accuracy. one interesting aspect of this
story is that one nds that the d-brane action supports solitonic congurations describing
lower-dimensional branes protruding from the original d-brane [7, 8, 9].

for instance, in the case of a d3-brane, one nds spike solutions corresponding to funda-
mental strings and d-strings (as well as strings) attached to the d3-brane. these congurations
have both the world-volume gauge elds and transverse scalar elds excited. the gauge eld
corresponds to that of a point charge arising from the end-point of the attached string, i.e.,
an electric charge for a fundamental string and a magnetic monopole charge for a d-string.
the scalar eld on the other hand, represents a deformation of the geometry of the d3-brane,
caused by attaching the strings.

naively, the range of validity of this analysis is limited to a range far from the core of the
spike where the elds on the d3-brane world-volume are slowly varying. this range can be
increased by increasing the number n of attached strings. (although n can not be too large
if we are to ignore gravitational eects). however, the results obtained seem to have a larger
regime of validity, maybe even all the way to center of the spike where it protrudes an innite
distance from the original position of the d3-brane. this can partly be understood in light
of the fact that the basic bps spike is a solution to the full derivative-corrected equations of
motion following from string theory [10]. even the dynamics of the spike, as probed through
small uctuations, agree with expected string behavior [11, 12, 13]. however, kastor and
traschen [13] showed that certain uctuation modes that are inherently three-dimensional also
appear propagate to innity in this picture, and hence the spike seems to retain its three-brane
character even at large distances.

the purpose of this paper is to study the dual description of a system of n d-strings
attached to a d3-brane. this system has been analyzed previously in [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
using the connection [14] between the nahm equations for bps monopoles [20] and the bps
condition for the nonabelian d-string theory. this theory contains noncommutative solutions
describing the d-strings expanding out in a funnel-like geometry to become an orthogonal d3-
brane. these solutions are valid in a regime complimentary to the bion spikes discussed above.
that is, the solutions will accurately describe the physics very close to the center of the spike,
or alternatively very far from the d3-brane. the two approaches, i.e., the d3-brane spikes and
the d-string funnels, turn out to agree exactly in the large n limit, while we get new insights
into the physics at nite n near the core of the spike from the d-string funnels.

in the next section we will quickly review the full nonabelian d-brane action, followed by

an outline of the remainder of this paper.

1

2 nonabelian brane action

our starting point is the nonabelian world-volume action describing n coincident d-strings,
whose complete form was recently discussed by myers [21], as well as taylor and van raams-
donk [22]. the action consists of two parts: the born-infeld action

sbi = t1z d2 str(cid:18)eq det (p [eab + eai(q1  )ijejb] +  fab) det(qi

j)(cid:19) ,

with

 = 22
s,

e = g + b,

and

qi

j  i

j + i [i, k] ekj,

and the chern-simons action

scs = 1z str(cid:16)phei ii(x c (n) eb)i e f(cid:17) .

(1)

(2)

(3)

implicitly, eqs. (1) and (3) employ static gauge where the two worldsheet coordinates are
identied with two spacetime coordinates. we have chosen  = t = x0 and  = x9. in these
expressions, p [  ] denotes the pullback of the enclosed spacetime tensors to the worldsheet.
the i, i = 1 . . . 8, are the transverse scalars, which are n  n matrices in the adjoint
representation of the u(n) worldsheet gauge symmetry. the notation i denotes the interior
product by i regarded as a vector in the transverse space, e.g., acting on a two-form c (2) =
1
2c (2)

 dxdx, we have

iic (2) =

[i, j] c (2)
ji

.

(4)

in both eqs. (1) and (3), the gauge trace indicated by str(  ) is a symmetrized trace. the
precise prescription proposed in ref. [21] was that inside the trace one takes a symmetrized
average over all orderings of the fab, dai, i[i, j], and also the individual i appearing in
the functional dependence of the background supergravity elds. we refer the reader to ref. [21]
for more details on these actions.

in ref. [21], the d-particle version of this action was used to analyze the behavior of n
d-particles when placed in a constant background rr eld f (4). this rr four-form is the
eld strength associated with d2-brane charge, and ordinarily d0-branes would be considered
neutral with respect to this eld. however, new couplings to the corresponding rr potential
c (3) appear in the nonabelian chern-simons action (3) of the d-particles. as a result, the
d-particles are polarized by the external eld into a noncommutative two-sphere, which can
be interpreted as a spherical d2-d0 bound state. this analysis can readily be generalized
to dp-branes in a background of constant f (p+4). starting with a at dp-brane with spatial
geometry rp, it will be energetically favorable for the brane to expand into a non-commutative
rp  s2 structure. for instance, in the case of d-strings, the chern-simons action (3) involves
a coupling

i1z trp [iic (4)] .

(5)

using the same manipulations as in ref. [21], assuming f (5) constant (in space), this term
produces a new contribution to the scalar potential of the form

i
3

21z dtd tr(cid:16)ijk(cid:17) f (5)

tijk(t).

(6)

as in ref. [21], one can nd solutions for i in terms of n dimensional representations of the
su(2) algebra, describing a d-string with an r1  s2 structure. the energy and radius of
this solution can also be calculated from a dual perspective from the d3-brane action with
appropriate world volume gauge elds excited, corresponding to dissolved d-strings. the two
approaches exactly agree in the large n limit. similar calculations in the dual d3-brane theory
appear in ref. [23].

in this paper we consider similar solutions of the nonabelian d-string theory. the scalar
eld conguration again has a similar interpretation in terms of noncommutative geometry
such that spatial slices have the topology r s2. however, now the i matrices depend on the
worldsheet coordinate , and so the radius of the two-sphere can vary along the length of the
d-string. in section 3.1, we study possible solutions in a at space background, and we obtain
congurations corresponding to n d-strings attached to a d3-brane. we compare features
of this solution  such as total energy, couplings to background elds, and the shape of the
conguration  to the corresponding aspects in the d3-brane spike. in the large n limit, there
is an exact correspondence. note that there are no nontrivial background elds here, and so
these constructions are quite distinct from the dielectric eect discussed above and in ref. [21].

following the initial papers on the d3-brane spike [7, 8, 9], there has been a considerable
literature studying various generalizations. this includes the construction of dyonic spikes
describing (p, q)-strings [15], analysis of double-funnel solutions [7, 8, 24], solutions in an ad-
ditional d3-brane supergravity background [25, 26], and solutions with fundamental strings
dissolved in the d3-brane [27]. we give a sample of how these situations can be described
from the dual d-string picture.
in section 3.2, we show the existence of the double-funnel
solutions describing d-strings stretched between a d3-brane and an anti-d3-brane (or another
d3-brane). in section 3.3, we give a brief description of how to construct (p, q)-string congu-
rations, while section 3.4 demonstrates how the bps funnels survive even when the system is
put in a supergravity background corresponding to a collection of d3-branes.

a d-string stretched between two d3-branes is represented as a nonabelian bps monopole
in the d3-brane theory. the dual d-string description provides a physical realization [14] of
the nahm equations [20]. this interpretation has already received extensive attention in the
literature [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. in this paper we consider the primarily the case of the d-string
funnel, in which one of the d3-branes has moved o to innity. our focus is on the large n
limit at the point in monopole moduli space where all the monopoles coincide. this allows us to
make a direct comparison with the bion spikes in the u(1) theory on the remaining d3-brane.
in particular, using the new terms in the nonabelian chern-simons action (3) [21, 22], we can
explicitly show that the funnel has couplings corresponding to a d3-brane.

the dynamics of the d3-brane spike has also been considered [11, 12, 13]. in section 4,
we analyze small uctuations propagating along the d-string in the funnel conguration. we
study both modes that are transverse and parallel to the d3-brane. again, in the large n limit,
we obtain exact agreement with the d3-brane analysis [11, 12, 13], in spite of the fact that the
present calculation involves noncommuting matrices and looks rather dierent. at nite n,
we nd signicant discrepancies with the d3-brane analysis [13] for the higher  modes.
in
particular, due to the noncommutative character of the funnel, the spectrum is truncated at
max = n  1. this suggests a resolution of the puzzle appearing in ref. [13], which was
mentioned above.

3

we conclude in section 5 with some further discussion and comments on our results.

3 d3-branes from d-strings

in this section we will describe various solutions in the nonabelian world-volume theory of a
d-string corresponding to the d-string opening up into a d3-brane.

3.1 the bps funnel

in at background, the chern-simons part (3) of the d-string action plays no role, while

the born-infeld action (1) reduces to [28, 21]1

s = t1z d2 strr det(cid:16)ab + 2aiq1

ij bj(cid:17) det (qij) ,

where

qij = ij + i[i, j] .

(7)

(8)

implicitly here, we have set the world-volume gauge eld to zero. this is consistent with the
equations of motions for the scalar eld congurations considered here. however, the gauge
eld will play an essential role in section 3.3 below. recall that we are using static gauge and
have chosen the world-volume coordinates to be  = t = x0 and  = x9. expanding this action
(7) to leading order (in ), yields the usual nonabelian scalar action

s  t1z d2  n +

2
2

tr(cid:18)aiai +

[i, j][j, i](cid:19) + . . .! .

1
2

varying this action yields the following equation of motion

aai = [j, [j, i]] .

(9)

(10)

now we are looking for solutions which represent the d-string expanding into a d3-brane,
analogous or dual to the bion solutions of the d3-brane theory [7, 8]. the corresponding
geometry would be a long funnel where the cross-section at xed  has the topology of a two-
sphere. hence motivated by the noncommutative two-sphere constructions of refs. [29, 21], we
consider the spherically symmetric ansatz

i = r() i,

i = 1, 2, 3,

where the i give some n  n matrix representation of the su(2) algebra

[i, j] = 2i ijk k .

(11)

(12)

now at xed , this ansatz for nonabelian scalars describes a noncommutative two-sphere with
a physical radius given by

1in these expressions, the transverse space indices are raised and lowered with gij = ij and gij = ij .

tr[i()2] = 2 c r()2 .

(13)

r()2 =

2
n

3xi=1

4

here c is the quadratic casimir of the particular representation of the generators under con-
sideration, dened by the identity

(i)2 = c in ,

3xi=1

(14)

where in is the n  n identity matrix. for example, c = n 2  1 for the irreducible n  n
representation.

now given the ansatz (11), the matrix equations of motion (10) reduce to a single scalar

equation

r() = 8 r()3 .

considering a trial solution, r  p, yields

r() = 

1

2(  )

,

(15)

(16)

where we have used the translation invariance of eq. (15) to introduce the integration constant
. since the second order equation (15) should have a general solution with two integration
constants, it is clear that eq. (16) is not the most general solution  we will leave this solution
to the next section. however, this solution (16) indeed describes the desired funnel, with the
d-string opening up into a three-brane at  = , where the radius of the funnel diverges. as it
stands eqs. (11) and (16) only represent a solution of the leading order equations of motion (10),
and so naively one expects that it should only be valid for small r or small radius. however, we
will nd that this conguration also solves the full equations of motion extremizing the action
(7).

before plunging into the full equations of motion, let us investigate the supersymmetry
of the funnel conguration above. following the analysis of callan and maldacena [7], we
investigate the linearized supersymmetry conditions, which strictly speaking would only apply
for the leading order action (9).2 we may write the linearized conditions as

f  = 0 ,

(17)

where ,  are ten-dimensional indices and  is some constant spinor. the latter world-volume
supersymmetry parameter also satises the usual d-string projection [3]: 09 = . note that
 transforms a spinor under both the so(1, 1) lorentz transformations of the d-string world-
volume theory, and the so(8) rotations of the transverse space. hence it is reasonable to
multiply  by ten-dimensional dirac matrices, such as  = [, ]/2. following the standard
notation (see, e.g., refs. [31]), where fab denotes the world-volume gauge eld strength which
vanishes in the present case, one also has

fai = dai ,

fij = ihi, ji .
(cid:16)2idi + ijkhj, ki(cid:17)  = 0 .

(18)

(19)

2supersymmetry conditions for the full nonabelian born-infeld action (7) would be expected to be more

hence eq. (17) yields

complicated [28, 30].

5

this condition can be solved by spinors satisfying the projection

provided that the scalars satisfy the nahm equations [14]

123 =  ,

now inserting our ansatz (11) this implies

di = 

i
2

ijkhj, ki .

r = 2 r2 .

(20)

(21)

(22)

however, the solution of this equation is precisely that given in eq. (16). hence, we conclude
that the funnel congurations given by eqs. (11) and (16) are in fact bps solutions preserving
1/2 of the supersymmetry of the d-string theory (9). from ref. [24], we can infer that bps
solutions of the leading order theory (9) are also bps solutions of the full nonabelian born-
infeld action (7). that is, the funnel solutions will also solve the full equations of motion, as
we will explicitly demonstrate below. in a related discussion, ref. [15] showed, in the context of
the full nonabelian d-string theory (7), that supersymmetric congurations satisfying eq. (21)
minimize the energy of the system.

we begin by substituting our ansatz (11) directly into the action (7), and nd that it

becomes

s = t1z d2 strr(cid:16)1 + 2ii( r)2(cid:17)(cid:16)1 + 42jj r4(cid:17) ,

(23)

where both i and j are summed over 1,2,3. in deriving this result, we have eliminated certain
combinations of matrices from the determinants (and inverses) which will cancel under the sym-
metrized trace. in the remaining expression, symmetrization applies to each of the individual
generators i appearing there. now extremizing this action (23) with respect to variations of
r yields an equation of motion which may be written as

1
r

d
d

strvuut 1 + 42jj r4

1 + 2ii( r)2

= 0 .

(24)

if the radius prole satises the supersymmetry constraint (22), then the expression under the
square root is simply the identity and it follows that the equation of motion is satised. hence
the supersymmetric funnel solutions are in fact solutions of the full nonabelian equations of
motion (24). note that we were able to derive this result without making an expansion (in )
of the matrix expression in eq. (24) and explicitly implementing the symmetric trace on the
individual terms in this expansion.

it is clear that the funnel solution, eqs. (11) and (16), describes the nonabelian d-string
opening up into a three-brane on the (x1,x2,x3) hypersurface at  = . while the natural
intuition is that the latter is actually a d3-brane, it remains to be demonstrated. we begin by
comparing our funnel solution to the d3-brane monopole or spike [7]. for these purposes, we
will focus on the funnel where the i are chosen as the irreducible n  n representation, with
c = n 2  1. in this case, the radius (13) becomes [16]

r =

n2
s

  q1  1/n 2 .

6

(25)

to leading order for large n, this yields precisely (including numerical coecient) with the
corresponding formula for the height of d3-brane spike [7], i.e.,

   =

n2
s

r

.

(26)

this remarkable agreement is perhaps more than one should expect, since the d3-brane analysis
is strictly speaking only valid for r large, while the current calculations will be reliable for small
r. we will comment more on this in the discussion section.

to further corroborate the fact that our funnel yields a d3-brane, let us compare the energy
and some couplings to those obtained from the dual d3-brane action. given our static solution,
the energy is easily derived from the d-string action (23). note that using the supersymmetry
condition (22), the two expressions under the square root are equal and hence the action is
linearized [15]. we are then left with

e = t1z d str(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1 + 42ii r4(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
= 2nt1z d r2| r|  d
d r!2

+ 2c ,

where we have repeatedly applied r = 2 r2 in producing the second expression. we can
further manipulate this result by introducing the physical radius r = c| r|, as well as using
t1 = 422

st3 to put this expression in the form

(27)

(28)

(29)

in the dual d3-brane picture, the energy of any (spherically symmetric) bps conguration3 is
simply given by [7, 15]

e = t3

n

c z 4r2dr  d
dr!2

+ 1 .

e = t3z d3x [1 + ()2]
= t3z 4r2dr1 +  d

dr!2 .

if we chose the irreducible representation, n/c = (1  1/n 2)1/2, and hence the energy

calculated in these two formulations agrees up to n 2 corrections for large n.

if a d3-brane is emerging in the funnel solution, this conguration should act as a source
for the rr four-form potential, c (4). such a coupling arises in the chern-simons action (3)
because of the nonabelian expectation value of the scalars in this solution. to leading order,
we can focus on the interaction given in (5), which yields

i1z trp [iic (4)] =

i21

2
= i3

tkji(, ) tr(cid:16)k [i, j](cid:17) + . . .

z d2 c (4)
c z dt 4r2dr c (4)

n

t123(t, r) .

(30)

3note that this expression holds regardless of whether electric elds, magnetic elds, or both are excited on

the d3-brane. hence the agreement found here is more generally applicable.

7

here we have used the ansatz (11) and r = c| r|, as well as 1 = 422
s3 and tr(ij) =
3 c ij. in the dual d3-brane formulation, essentially the same expression arises in the standard
coupling to the rr four-form

n

3z p [c (4)] = 3z dt dr d d c (4)
= 3z dt 4r2dr c (4)

t123(t, r) .

tijk xixjxk + . . .

(31)

so once again if we chose the irreducible representation, we would have n/c = (11/n 2)1/2,

and for large n eqs. (30) and (31) agree up to n 2 corrections. it is interesting that in deriving
this agreement for the rr coupling, we only used the basic ansatz (11), but not the details
of the funnel solution (16). hence this result will hold more generally, and in particular it
still holds in the following sections. in eq. (30), the minus (plus) sign arises if r is positive
(negative). hence this calculation shows that the minus-solution in eq. (16) corresponds to
the d-string opening up into a d3-brane (assuming we approach from  > ), while the
plus-solution has the opposite orientation and corresponds to an anti-d3-brane.

to summarize this section, we have shown that by allowing for suitable boundary conditions
in the nonabelian d-string theory, the latter can grow into a d3-brane. this construction is a
dual formulation of the bps magnetic monopole in the abelian d3-brane theory which describes
a d-string spike growing out of the three-brane surface. in the present calculation, we see that
the geometry at the core of the spike is noncommutative, with the level of discreteness set by n,
the number of d-strings. in these last few calculations, we have focused on using the irreducible
n  n representation of the su(2) generators (12), and we found good quantitative agreement
at large n between the two formulations. these calculations indicate that the funnel solution
describes the n d-strings expanding into a single fundamental d3-brane. using reducible
representations would correspond to creating several (independent) d3-branes from the same
n d-strings. paralleling the constructions in ref. [21], one could then construct multi-center
funnels located at dierent positions in the (x1, x2, x3) hypersurface.

3.2 double funnels

with the ansatz (11), the leading-order matrix equations became r = 8 r3 in eq. (15). as

a rst step to generating the most general solution, we integrate this equation as

( r)2 = 4( r4  r4

0) ,

(32)

0 is an arbitrary integration constant. in principle then, integrating once more yields

where r4
the general solution

 =

2z

qer4  er4

.

(33)

this solution looks remarkably similar to those describing double funnels or wormholes in dual
d3-brane framework [7, 8].

however, before examining the details of these congurations, let us consider the analogous
solutions of the full equation of motion (24). the symmetrized prescription [32, 21] instructs us
to expand the square root expression and symmetrize over all permutations of the generators
i in the trace of each term in the expansion. for example: str(ii) = nc, str(iijj) =

8

n(c 2  4c/3), and str(iijjkk) = n(c 3  4c 2 + 16c/3). unfortunately, we have not
been able to nd a systematic construction for the general term in this expansion. however,
observing that at leading order, str(ii)m  nc m, we can construct an approximate equation
by replacing the ii by c in in eq. (24). for large n, this keeps the leading order contribution
at every order (in ) in the expansion of the square roots. within this approximation the
equation of motion becomes

n
r

d

dvuut 1 + 42c r4

1 + 2c( r)2

= 0 .

integrating this equation is trivial, and the result may be expressed as

( r)2 = 4

r4  r4
1 + 42c r4
0

0

.

in terms of the physical radius (13), we have

(r)2 = 4

r4  r4
2c + 4r4
0

0

,

(34)

(35)

(36)

(39)

(40)

where we have also rescaled the integration constant in the obvious way. the solution of this
equation is then implicitly given by

 =  +

1

2z 

r

der vuut

2c + 4r4
0

0

er4  r4

.

(37)

with c = n 21 for the irreducible representation, eq. (37) precisely reproduces the general
solutions constructed in refs. [7, 8] for large n. for r0 = 0 we recover the supersymmetric
funnel solution (25). for large r, the general solution approximates this funnel and so given
our previous discussion the nonabelian d-string is again expanding into a d3-brane at  = .
assuming r4
0 > 0, we see from eq. (36) that the noncommutative funnel stops contracting when
r = r0. the obvious solution to continue past this point is [7, 8]

 =  + 2 

1

2z 

r

(38)

where  = (r0)  . hence beyond the minimum radius, the solution re-expands into
an anti-d3-brane at  =  + 2.4 thus we have reproduced the wormhole solutions of
refs. [7, 8] from the point of view of the nonabelian d-string theory.

in integrating eq. (34), one could also choose a negative integration constant, in which case

it is natural to write

(r)2 = (r

0)2 + 4

0)2

1 + (r

r4 ,

where r

0 is a new dimensionless integration constant. the general solution then becomes

2z 

r

0)2/4

4verifying that the emergence of a d3-brane or an anti-d3-brane at either end of these double funnel solutions

actually requires examining the sign of r as  =  and  + 2, as per the discussion in the section 3.1.

9

in this case, the funnel collapses all the way down to zero radius, which is approached with a
nite slope, i.e., from eq. (39), r(r = 0) = r
so one can continue the solution beyond this point if one allows the radius to become negative.
alternatively, keeping the radius positive, we would match eq. (40) onto

0. the integrand has no singularity at er = 0, and

where now  = (r = 0) . hence in this solution, the funnel collapses down to zero size
and then re-expands into another d3-brane4 at  =  + 2. these general solutions again
match, for large n, the analogous cusp congurations constructed in the d3-brane framework
[24]. for comparison purposes, it may be simpler to think of these solutions in the form given
0 < 0. note that in this case, we must choose 2c/4 < r4
in eqs. (37) and (38), but with r4
to produce a real solution. this lower bound r4
0  2c/4 corresponds to the singular limit
r
0  .
these cusp solutions describe n d-strings stretched between two parallel d3-branes (or anti-
d3-branes), which should be a supersymmetric conguration. however, the supersymmetry
condition (22) is only satised when r
0 = 0, in which case the d-string extends o to innity
before reaching zero size. in the dual d3-brane framework, hashimoto [24] identied the correct
supersymmetric solution for n = 1 as a bps monopole of the nonabelian world-volume theory
describing the two d3-branes. to nd the corresponding bps solutions in the d-string theory,
one must begin with an ansatz more general than eq. (11) when solving the nahm equations
(21). such solutions are known, see for example refs. [33, 18]. we leave a discussion of these
solutions for future work [34].

3.3 (p, q)-strings

the previous analysis is readily generalized to (p, q)-strings, i.e., bound states of d-strings
and fundamental strings [35]. this is done by simply introducing a background u(1) elec-
tric eld on the d-strings, corresponding to fundamental strings dissolved on the worldsheet.
denoting the electric eld as f  = e in , the d-string action (23) becomes

s = t1z d2 strr(cid:16)1  2e 2 + 2ii( r)2(cid:17)(cid:16)1 + 42jj r4(cid:17) ,

where we have inserted the noncommutative ansatz (11). extremizing with respect to variations
of r yields

(42)

(43)

(44)

(45)

now assuming e constant, a simple rescaling of eq. (22) yields an exact solution, i.e.,

hence the funnel solution for the (p, q)-string becomes

r() =

(46)

where we have used eq. (44) to derive the nal result. one can verify that the equations of
motion for the world-volume gauge eld specify d to be a constant, and so our assumption of
constant e is consistent for any solution r() obeying eq. (43). for nf fundamental strings,
one obtains the correct (p, q)-string tension by quantizing d = nf /n, remembering that the
fundamental string tension is simply 1/  see below.

to determine the energy of the system, we must evaluate the hamiltonian,r d(del), for

the dyonic funnel solutions. manipulating this expression in a manner similar to the analogous
calculations in eqs. (27,28), the nal result may be expressed as a sum of two terms

e = t1z dqn 2 + g2n 2

f + t3

n

c z 4r2dr .

(47)

where g is the string coupling, and we remind the reader that t1 = (g)1. here the rst term
comes from collecting the contributions independent of r, and correctly matches the energy
of the (n, nf )-string bound state [35]. the second contribution involves the terms containing
r and as in section 3.1, eq. (44) is used to put these in the form r2 | r|. the nal result
corresponds to the expected energy of an orthogonal d3-brane, at large n. our expression (47)
also matches the expectations (for large n) from the similar calculations in the d3-brane theory
[15]. eq. (29) still applies in this case, and in this formulation the ()2 term provides the
contribution of the (n, nf )-string. in the d3-brane formulation, it is straightforward to show
that the dyonic spike is still supersymmetric. however, in the d-string formulation, introducing
a constant background electric eld moves the theory to a new superselection sector where the
supersymmetry is nonlinearly realized.5 by the sl(2, z) duality of the type iib superstring
theory, it is clear that a (n, nf )-string has precisely the same amount of supersymmetry as an
ordinary d-string. similarly the dyonic funnel will be a bps conguration preserving 1/2 of the
world-volume supersymmetries. this supersymmetry is reected in that these congurations
(44) satisfy the full equations of motion (43), and that the corresponding energy (47) splits into
a sum of string and three-brane contributions.

there are also various other solutions known in the literature involving (p, q)-strings (see, for
example, ref. [26]), and these should presumably also follow from the full equations of motion
(43) in a straightforward manner. for related discussion on string junctions, see refs. [18, 19].

3.4 embedding in a d3-brane background

we now consider constructing a noncommutative funnel for a nonabelian d-string sitting in
the background of a set of orthogonal d3-branes. according to refs. [25, 26], when working with
a test d3-brane sitting in such a supergravity background, the bps born-infeld spike solutions
are unchanged by the background elds. hence one might expect that the funnel solutions
(11,16) will also appear unchanged in the modied world-volume theory of the d-strings.

5we would like to thank amanda peet for a discussion on this point.

where the xi, i = 1 . . . 3, directions are parallel to the d3-brane, and the xm, m = 4 . . . 9,
directions are transverse. the function h satises the laplace equation: mmh = 0. the
single center harmonic function is

(50)

the magnetic part of the potential will only involve indices in the transverse xm directions, and
we will argue below that it is irrelevant for the present calculation.

now consider n d-strings extending into the transverse space along the x9-axis. we again
choose static gauge for the d-string action with  = t and  = x9. in the nonabelian chern-
simons action (3), we have the interactions

in the solution which we will construct, we assume that: (i) there are no background gauge
elds so the covariant derivatives in the pullbacks are simply ordinary partial derivatives, (ii)
the solution is static so that dtl = tl = 0, and (iii) for later purposes, that only the
i in the xi directions are relevant, i.e., we only consider deformations of the d-string in
its transverse directions which are parallel to the world-volume directions of the background
d3-brane. further, from eqs. (48) or (50), we know that c (4)
t9ji = 0. hence the only relevant
interaction above is

21z d2 str(cid:16)c (4)

in the background rr potential and the metric, we have the harmonic function (49) which

is only a function of the nonabelian radius

r2 = 2 + 2h(4)2 + (5)2 + . . .i  2 .

in the last step, in keeping with the assumptions listed above, we have ignored the uctuations
of the d-string in the xm-directions. this simplies the calculation since we have h = h(),

12

(52)

(53)

however, we might expect some smearing of the d-string in the xm-directions at higher order.
with this simplication, the chern-simons interaction becomes

(54)

where for deniteness, we have chosen the plus sign for the potential in eq. (50). this choice
corresponds to a background of d3-branes (as opposed to anti-d3-branes).

the born-infeld part of the action is only slightly modied by the background metric. for

our usual ansatz (11), the born-infeld action now reads

sbi = t1z d2 strvuut 1 +

since the function h depends on , the full equations of motion following from this action are

in the second term on the left hand side, d/ d denotes that the  derivative only acts on the
harmonic function h. the right hand side of this equation is the contribution from the chern-
simons term in eq. (56). now if as in eq. (22), we set ( r)2 = 4 r4, the rst two terms vanish
and the entire expression reduces to simply

with the standard solution

r = 

r = 2 r2 ,

(58)

(59)

hence the background picks out the noncommutative funnel which corresponds to the d-string
expanding into a d3-brane, but not the one where an anti-d3-brane emerges. this should
have been expected because an anti-d3-brane would be unstable in the d3-brane background.
choosing the opposite sign of the rr potential in eq. (54) would correspond to putting the d-
string in the supergravity background generated by a collection of anti-d3-branes. this would
also change the sign of the chern-simons contribution in the equation of motion (57) to produce
r = 2 r2 in place of eq. (58). hence in this case, the noncommutative funnel corresponding to
an anti-d3-brane would be picked out. in any event, the bps funnel solution consistent with the

13

supersymmetry of the background survives unchanged, just as for the analogous solutions found
in the d3-brane formulation. as a nal note here, we observe that this conguration solves
the full equations of motion (57) regardless of the detailed functional form of h. in particular,
the position of the end of the funnel, i.e.,  = , is still an independent parameter, not
correlated to the position(s) of the background d3-branes. further, one could consider multi-
center solutions for h.

4 fluctuations of the d-string funnel

in this section, we analyze the dynamics of the bps funnel solution (16) (in a at background).
that is, we examine the linearized equations of motion for small, time-dependent uctuations
of the transverse scalars r, around the exact background i = 1
2 i.6 there are two types
of uctuations to consider: the rst, in the language of ref. [13], are the overall transverse
excitations given by the scalars m which are transverse to both the d-string and the non-
commutative two-sphere (or d3-brane). the second are the relative transverse uctuations of
the coordinate elds i which lie in the two-sphere directions. our notation in the following
will be that indices i, j = 1 . . . 3 denote the directions parallel to the d3-brane, m, n = 4 . . . 8
represent directions transverse to both the d-string and the d3-brane, and nally r, s = 1 . . . 8
include all of these directions.

we start with the overall transverse uctuations. the simplest type of uctuation is just
proportional to the identity matrix, say m(, t) = f m(, t)in . for these modes it is straight-
forward to plug into the action (7), and we nd

s = t1z d2strvuut 1 +

(61)

in the nal action, we have only kept the terms quadratic in the uctuations as this is sucient
to determine the linearized equations of motion:
t  2

(62)

this is precisely the equation of motion found for the transverse uctuations of the dbi spike
soliton in refs. [7, 11, 13]. the identication of the function h with the corresponding functions
in refs. [7, 11, 13] requires 2c/4 = 2n 22
s, which again holds up to 1/n 2 corrections for large
n. note that this equation was also found to agree with the equation of motion for a uctuating
test string in the supergravity background of a d3-brane [11], after identifying parameters on
both sides in a specic way.7

(cid:17) f m = 0 .

(cid:16)h2

6for simplicity, we have set  = 0. we will also choose the generators for the background solution to lie in

n  n irreducible representation. hence c = n 2  1.
7more precisely, the functional forms of the equations agree, while the parameters undergo some form of
renormalization between the two pictures. exact matching occurs only at a specic point in parameter space,
on the border between the two regimes of validity.

14

in the detailed analysis of ref. [13], the uctuations in eq. (62) correspond to the  = 0
modes, i.e., modes constant on the two-sphere. we will now show that, up to an important
modication, similar agreement also holds for the higher  modes. to describe the  > 0
modes we rst note, following refs. [29, 37], that the uctuations m can be expanded on the
non-commutative two-sphere as a polynomial series in the matrices i as follows,

m(, t) =

n 1x=0

i1i2...i(, t) i1i2    i
m

(63)

where the coecients m
i1i are completely symmetric and traceless in the lower indices. also
note that the series must terminate after n  1 terms since there are at most this many linearly
independent matrices which can be formed from an n  n irreducible representation of the
i. in the large n limit this expansion is analogous to expanding the uctuations in spherical
harmonics on a commutative two-sphere.

substituting this form of the uctuations into the action (7) is now slightly more involved,
and it is more straightforward to use an alternative form of the action, given in terms of eq. (26)

in ref. [21]. in at space, this form of the action (7) reads s = t1r q d, with

d = det(cid:18) ab
br

as

rs + i [r, s](cid:19) ,

(64)

where r includes the background i and the overall transverse uctuations m. in general,
this leads to a 10  10 determinant, which, however, is straightforward to evaluate keeping in
mind the symmetrization procedure. we nd that the resulting action is same as in the rst
line of eq. (60) up to the addition of an extra commutator term 2[i, m][m, i] in the
second factor under the square root. the quadratic action then becomes

[i, m][m, i]

(65)

where the last term arises from taking care to expand the symmetrized trace in the kinetic
term. now the linearized equation of motion becomes

(cid:16)h2

t  2

(cid:17) m +hi, [i, m]i 

2

6 hi, [i, 2

t m]i = 0

(66)

in order to make contact with the discussion in ref. [13], we must evaluate the commutator
terms in this equation for the background solution i = 1
2 i. to facilitate this we will make
use of the expansion in eq. (63). specically, we evaluate

hi, [i, m]i = x<n
= x<n

m

i1i2ihi, [i, i1i2    i]i
i1i2ii1i2    i ,

4( + 1) m

(67)

making use of the fact that m
i1i2i is completely symmetric and traceless. so we see that
the double commutator above essentially acts like the laplacian on the noncommutative two-
sphere. hence restricting the uctuation to contain products with a xed number of generators,

15

i.e., to contain a specic spherical harmonic on the two-sphere, we have

hi, [i, m

 ]i =

( + 1)

and

hi, [i, 2

thus we see that the equation of motion for each mode becomes

(69)

(70)

again for large n and   n, this reproduces the equation of motion for overall transverse
uctuations found from the d3-brane spike [13]. however, for large  the coecient in h is
signicantly modied compared to the d3-brane analysis. another important dierence is that
in the noncommutative d-string analysis, the spectrum of modes is truncated at max = n  1.
note that given this truncation, the coecient of 1/4 in (70) can not be negative  such
a negative coecient would have caused drastic changes in the mode propagation. thus for
nite n, there are a nite number of modes propagating in the core of the bion. note that
=0 (2 + 1) = n 2. of course, this counting is precisely what is expected for
the adjoint scalars in the u(n) theory on the world-volume of the n d-strings. a puzzle was
raised in the d3-brane analysis [13], where it appeared that modes with arbitrarily high  would
propagate out along the d-string spike. the present d-string analysis suggests that this is not
the case, and that the propagation of high  modes is signicantly modied. we will comment
more on this point in the discussion section.

this number is pn 1

we nally briey discuss the case of relative transverse uctuations, i. from the d3-brane
point of view these are considerably more complicated to analyze, because of the interplay
between the scalar eld and the gauge eld. in the d-string picture, an increased complication
arises in evaluating the symmetrized trace. unfortunately, we do not have an exact treatment
of the quadratic action. instead we use the same approximation as in section 3.2, replacing in
the action everywhere ii by c in . for large n, this keeps the leading contribution at every
order in  in an expansion of the action. as above, rst let us consider the  = 0 mode, and
for concreteness consider a uctuation in the x3-direction, 3(, t) = f (, t)in . one can show
that uctuations in dierent directions decouple at linear order, using tr(ij) = nc/3 ij.
the determinant in (64) now involves a 55 matrix which again is straightforward to calculate.
we nd

nicely arrange into

the equations of motion follow immediately, and again agree, for large n, with the results from
the d3-brane spike and from supergravity [11, 13].

higher  modes can be treated similarly. for instance, the  = 1 breathing mode considered
in ref. [13] is implemented by the uctuations i(, t) = f (, t)i. the resulting action is found

16

most easily by substituting r  r + f in the born-infeld action (23), adding the obvious term
involving time-derivatives. the resulting equation of motion reads

t f    f

h 22 (4  h)f = 0.

(73)

the corresponding equation is only given indirectly in ref. [13], but through a bit of algebra
one can verify that the two approaches agree, again up to 1/n 2 corrections.

5 discussion

making use of the recently proposed nonabelian extension of the born-infeld action describing
the world-volume physics of dp-branes [21, 22], we have found a description of a d-string ending
on a d3-brane dual to that obtained from the abelian d3-brane action. specically we have
shown that the world-volume action for n coincident d-strings has exact bps solutions which
describe a d3-brane growing out of the noncommuting transverse coordinates of the collection
of d-strings. we generalized this construction to describe (p, q)-strings by considering the case
where there are a number of fundamental strings dissolved on the worldsheet of the d-string. we
have also considered the case where the d-string is embedded in the supergravity background
of a collection of d3-branes, and shown that the supersymmetric funnel remains a solution with
its form unchanged. in all these cases we have found, in the large n limit, precise agreement
with the earlier literature on the dbi spike soliton [7, 8, 9, 15, 25].

as commented before, in these constructions (except in section 3.4), there are no nontrivial
supergravity elds in the ambient spacetime. hence these solutions are quite distinct from
the congurations arising from the dielectric eect discussed in ref. [21]. the latter involves a
collection of dp-branes being polarized into a noncommutative conguration by an external
eld. as well as using the nonabelian character of the d-string theory, the essential new feature
of the present constructions is the introduction of unusual (i.e., singular) boundary conditions
in the world-volume theory [16, 17]. for example, in the bps funnel (16) the scalars diverge
at  = . to comment on these boundary conditions further, let us consider the solution
for dierent representation of the generators i. throughout the paper, we emphasized the
irreducible n  n representation, for which we found that the funnel corresponded precisely to
the n d-strings expanding into a single d3-brane. one could reconsider the analysis when the
i are chosen as the direct sum of q copies of the n
q representation. in this case, one would
nd that the bps funnel (16) describes an expansion into q coincident d3-branes at  = .
using energy considerations as in eq. (28), naively one might conclude that it is favorable for
this conguration to decay into the original funnel. of course, this is incorrect  the q d3-
branes can not decay into a single d3-brane. rather one should think of the new solution
as a dierent superselection sector, which is distinguished in our construction by imposing a
distinct set of boundary conditions at    (or alternatively at r  ).

q  n

actually from the d-string point of view, the scalar elds start to vary extremely rapidly as
   and so our description in terms of the low energy world-volume action (7) will break
down before this point is reached. on the other hand, as    the world-volume scalars are
both slowly varying and small, and so our formulation should give a very reliable description
of the physics. this behavior is complementary to the d3-brane analysis. from this point of

17

view, the world-volume elds are slowly varying and small for large r, and rapidly varying for
small r. thus these two approaches give complementary descriptions for the dbi spike. we
note that this complementarity arises because of the duality8

n2
s


r 

(74)

between the world-volume coordinates in the two dierent formulations.

let us try to be more precise about the ranges of validity where we think we can trust
the born-infeld analysis in each of these approaches. essentially, we must determine when
we can condently ignore higher derivative corrections to the action arising from the usual 
expansion in string theory. schematically we would require s2  . for the spike soliton
on the d3-brane, this translates into r  s, or using eq. (74),   ns. from the d-string
funnel point of view, we must require   s, which is equivalent to r  ns. so we see that
in a large n limit, there is a signicant overlap region, and this explains, at least partially, the
good agreement we nd between the two approaches in this regime.

beyond the higher derivative corrections, the nonabelian action (1,3) requires additional
higher order commutator corrections [38, 39, 40]  see also the discussion in ref. [21]. given
this limitation, we might conclude that our nonabelian d-string calculations are reliable only
for small commutators. for the bps funnel, we require s| r|  1 since the commutators of
the scalar elds are characterized by the dimensionless quantity s r. in terms of the physical
radius, this restriction becomes r  ns, which coincides with the restriction derived in the
previous discussion. a better restriction for avoiding the higher commutator corrections is
that the taylor expansion of the square root in the action (23) should converge rapidly. this
requirement leads to the more restrictive condition that r  ns. however, for large n,

there is still overlap with the d3-brane approach over a large region. we should add, however,
that this discussion applies to generic eld corrections. there are some indications that for
supersymmetric congurations, the higher commutator corrections may vanish [38, 39], and so
the less conservative restriction above may be the correct one for the bps funnel.

we should also remember that we have neglected gravitational eects, which is justied
when gn  1. since none of our analysis involves the string coupling g, this requirement is
easily satised by going to very weak coupling.

in section 4, we also found remarkable agreement for the dynamics of small uctuations
on the d-string funnel and those on the d3-brane spike, for large n and also   n. our
analysis begins to show signicant discrepancies for higher  modes. in particular, the spectrum
of modes on the noncommutative funnel is truncated at max = n  1. this brings us to the
puzzle arising from ref. [13]. there the detailed analysis of the uctuations on the d3-brane
spike showed that there was no suppression of the higher  modes near the core. hence modes
with arbitrarily large  appeared to propagate out to innity, and the spike would seem to
retain its three-dimensional character arbitrarily far out rather making a transition to string-
like behavior. since our d-string analysis provides a reliable description of physics at the core
of the spike, we conclude that this result cannot be correct. we have found that only a nite
number of modes propagate far from the d3-brane. note, however, that for n d-strings, this
number is n 2, not just n, due to the nonabelian character of the coincident d-strings.

8for simplicity, we set  = 0 here. further we assume the irreducible n  n representation with large n,

so that c  n 2. both of these assumptions will apply throughout the remainder of the discussion.

above we considered in detail in what regimes the d3-brane and d-string descriptions would
be trustworthy. however, this analysis was only for the spike or funnel solution itself, which
plays the role of a background in the calculations of the linearized uctuations. hence we should
repeat this preceding analysis for the uctuations themselves. in particular, a uctuation on
the d3-brane with angular momentum number  oscillates on spheres of constant radius with
an eective wavelength  = r/. hence for higher derivative corrections to the d3-brane action
to be negligible, we must require that /s  1. hence r  s or from eq. (74),   (n/)s.
therefore even if we assume n is large, we can only trust the linearized equations of motion to
accurately describe the propagation of uctuations far out on the spike for   n. similarly
the regime of validity of the analysis for uctuations on the d-string funnel is more restrictive
for the higher  modes.
in this case, we require that higher commutator corrections to the
nonabelian born-infeld action remain negligible. given the commutators in eq. (68), it appears
the relevant quantity to characterize the commutators is s r. thus our calculations would be
trustworthy for r  (n/)s or   s. hence we conclude that we should not expect the
two approaches to agree on the dynamics of the linearized uctuations for   n or higher.

therefore it seems that the resolution of the conict between the results of ref. [13] and the
present paper is that the dynamics of the high  modes is signicantly altered in a transition
region between regimes where either of the two formulations can be trusted.
in particular,
higher derivative corrections to the d3-brane action must play an important role near the core
of the spike, and cause the very high  modes to be reected back out to the region of large
radius. unfortunately, beyond the observations made above, we can not provide a detailed
account of this suppression mechanism.

to summarize, we have again seen that the born-infeld action is a remarkably powerful
tool in describing the low energy dynamics of dp-branes. on the one hand, with the d3-
brane action one can construct spike congurations corresponding to d-strings attached to the
d3-brane, and the validity of these solutions seems to go far beyond naive expectations. in
this paper, we have shown how these congurations also emerge from the d-string action in
terms of noncommutative geometry. this formulation provides a reliable description of the
central core of the dbi spike, but is also reliable to a very large radius when the number of
d-strings is large. hence we nd surprising agreement with the original d3-brane theory point
of view. combining these two approaches presents an intriguing picture of d-strings attached
to an orthogonal d3-brane. at large radius we have a continuous d3-brane being smoothly
deformed into the spike geometry. however, near the core far out along the spike, there is
a metamorphosis to a discrete structure, namely a noncommutative funnel geometry. one
can begin to gain insight into this transition from the recent observations in ref. [41]. in the
d3-brane analysis, the spike is a magnetic monopole. thus there is also a constant ux of
magnetic eld on the spheres of constant radius surrounding the spike. as the radius shrinks
the local ux density becomes very large, and hence we can expect to enter a regime where
noncommutative geometry provides an ecient description of the system.

despite the striking agreement in the shape of the d3-brane spike and the d-string funnel,
one may question whether or not the agreement should actually be complete.
in ref. [10],
thorlacius showed that the bps spike solution found on the d3-brane was actually a solution
of the full string action. this analysis was made for the electric spike describing a fundamental
string, and it appears the proof would be more involved for the magnetic monopole describing
the d-string [42]. certainly the d3-brane and the d-string theories yield the same shape for

19

the latter conguration, however they only agree on the overall coecient for large n. for
small n, the coecients will dier signicantly. it may still be that the monopole provides
an exact boundary conformal eld theory, but that there is a renormalization of the metric
relevant to describing the geometry. this would be somewhat similar to the dierence between
the closed and open string metrics in situations where noncommutative geometry is relevant
[41]. however, we will leave this question for future work.

it would be interesting to generalize the present discussion to other d-brane systems. the
extension to dp-branes ending on orthogonal d(p + 2)-branes would follow trivially by the
application of t-duality. a more interesting extension would be to consider a d-string ending
on an orthogonal dp-brane with p 6= 3. from the lowest order equation of motion (10), a static
conguration would still have to satisfy

2

i =hj, [j, i]i .

(75)

with the ansatz i = r() gi for some constant matrices gi, this equation can still only yield
a dierential equation of the form

r = a r3 ,

(76)
with some constant a, and one will again nd solutions of the form r  1. hence this type
of prole is universal for all funnels on the d-string in any situation, and the only dierence
from the d3-brane funnel will be in the overall constant coecient. this result is slightly
surprising since from the dual dp-brane formulation, one would generically expect that for large
r, solutions will essentially be harmonic functions behaving like   r(p2) or r  1/(p2).
the resolution of this puzzle seems to be that the two proles apply in distinct regimes, the
rst for small r and the second for large r. however, there is the possibility that solutions
of the full born-infeld action will display a transition from one kind of behavior to another.
in fact, we have begun analyzing the case of a d-string ending on an orthogonal d5-brane in
detail, and we nd that funnel solutions do indeed make this kind of transition [43].
