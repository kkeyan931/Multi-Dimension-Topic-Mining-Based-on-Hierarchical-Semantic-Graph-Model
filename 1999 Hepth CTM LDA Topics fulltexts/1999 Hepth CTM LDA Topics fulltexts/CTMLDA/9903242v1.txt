abstract

we discuss issues related to orientifolds and the brane realization for gauge theories
with orthogonal and symplectic groups. we specically discuss the case of theories with
(hidden) global so(2n) symmetry, from three to six dimensions. we analyze mirror sym-
metry for three dimensional n=4 gauge theories, brane box models and six-dimensional
gauge theories. we also discuss the issue of t-duality for dn space-time singularities.
stuck d branes on on 0 planes play an interesting role.

1 introduction

this paper discusses issues related to orientifolds. the motivation which led to this project
was to understand various strong coupling behaviour of orientifold planes. these planes play
an important role in understanding the non-perturbative properties of string theories. they
can also be used for realizing and studying, using branes, gauge theories with orthogonal and
symplectic gauge groups; in this perspective, the dictionary for translating dierent gauge the-
ories into brane congurations is still under construction. there are several types of orientifold
planes. for most of them, we know, at least classically, what is the gauge theory realized on
branes living in the presence of these orientifolds. however, as will be discussed below, there
are cases (the somehow exotic plane o 1 or the on planes acting on ns-branes) in which the
entries in the dictionary are still mysterious. moreover, even when everything is understood at
the classical level, the strong coupling behaviour of these congurations is not well understood;
this prevents us from extracting non-perturbative results from the brane conguration for the

corresponding gauge theory. unfortunately, this lack of understanding is common to many
dierent orientifold congurations.

in this paper, we make a rst step in the direction of better understanding these con-
gurations and we analyze a class of theories, with various supersymmetries and in various
dimensions, with global so(2n) symmetry. the issues which will be discussed here in more
detail are:

 mirror symmetry in three dimensions.

 various constructions of brane box models involving orientifold planes.

 some issues in six dimensional theories.

 more constructions of finite four dimensional gauge theories using branes.

all the theories presented have in common a dn type global symmetry. since, besides the use
of an orientifold, theories with dn global symmetry can be realized by engineering space-time
singularities, there is a natural question that arises in relation to the models discussed in this
paper and that we will discuss in some detail:

 what happens to a dn space-time singularity when we perform a t-duality?

the answer for this question in the case of a ak singularity is extensively discussed in the
literature, and here we present the dn case. the understanding of the behaviour of singularities
under t-duality helps in relating (and therefore in better understanding) dierent approaches
with branes to the same gauge theory. for each of the theories considered in this paper, we will
discuss the fate of the congurations under t-duality and the relation with dierent approaches
in the literature.

let us briey summarize what is known about the orientifold zoo.
there are several types of orientifold planes. the most familiar and most discussed one
is the op plane which carries negative rr charge, that is in units in which the charge of a
dp-brane is positive (we will take the charge of a physical brane to be +1 in this paper). the
charge of this op plane is 2p5. a collection of n physical dp-branes located at the op plane
give rise to a dn gauge theory on the world volume of the dp-branes, that is an enhanced
so(2n) gauge theory. henceforth this orientifold will be called op, in short. if there are 2p5
physical dp branes located on top of an op plane, we get a special case in which the rr
charge of this object is zero. the corresponding rr eld has no sources coming from such an
object which makes it special and leads to interesting phenomena in various dimensions and
supersymmetries. for a recent discussion for the case of o6 planes see [1]. we will call this
object op0.

another type of orientifold is also fairly discussed in the literature. this orientifold plane
carries an opposite charge with respect to the op plane, +2p5, and will be called op+. a
collection of n physical dp-branes sitting on top of this orientifold plane give rise to an enhanced
cn gauge theory on the world volume of the dp-branes, that is a sp(n) gauge theory.

with this realization of gauge theories, the natural question which arises is what is the
realization of bn type gauge theories. (we remind that an gauge theories are given by collecting
n + 1 branes on top of each other, with no presence of an orientifold plane). the answer to this
question is also well known. if one puts a stuck dp-brane on the op plane and, in addition, n
physical branes, one gets the desired construction. the charge of a stuck dp-brane is +1/2, this
means that the charge of the orientifold with a stuck dp-brane on it is 1/2  2p5. henceforth,
this orientifold plane will be called gop.

a last type of orientifold plane is the less familiar object out of all other. this orientifold
plane was discussed in various papers [2, 3, 4] where the special cases of p = 3 and p = 4 were
discussed. t-duality suggests the existence of this orientifold plane for any p and this issue will

be discussed elsewhere2. this orientifold plane will be called dop. a universal charge formula

for this orientifold plane is not clear at the moment.

once we accept the existence of these types of orientifold planes, the next natural question
which comes to mind is what is the strong coupling behavior of such planes? in many cases the
answer appears in the literature. one notable work on this issue is of sen, [5] where he gives a
description of strong coupling behaviour of op planes for various values of p. less is known
about the other types of orientifolds.

a special case is p = 5. we ask what is the strong coupling of an o5 plane. we will call
such an object an on plane which comes from the fact that s-duality of type iib implies that
this orientifold carries magnetic charge with respect to the ns two-form of type iib. t-duality
also implies that there will be a similar object in type iia theory, that is an on plane which
carries a ns two-form charge. as for the op planes, we assume that there are four types of

such objects which will be denoted by on , on +, gon, don. the charges of these objects are
2 for gon and not clear for don. similar to the op0 object,
1 for on , +1 for on +, + 1
we can have a conguration with a physical ns brane sitting on top of an on  plane. this
conguration carries no ns two-form charge and will be denoted on 0. like the op0 objects
the absence of ns two-form charge leads to interesting eld theory consequences which makes
this conguration special.

another set of questions which arise in the presence of such orientifolds is what is the gauge
theory which lives on the world volume of dp-brane which have some directions which are not
parallel to the orientifold planes. as an example, we would like to know what is the world

volume gauge theory of a collection of d4-branes which are sitting transverse to an gon plane

in a supersymmetric fashion. all combinations of this type are of natural interest.

in this paper we will mainly focus on theories with so(2n) global symmetry. the recent
understanding of the properties of the on 0 plane [6, 7] helps us in extending previous analysis of
mirror symmetry in three dimensions [8, 9], brane box models [10, 11, 12] and six-dimensional
theories [13, 14, 15] to the case with dn symmetry. essentially, this paper extends what was
done in the above mentioned papers from the ak series to the dn series. in this context, it is
of great importance to understand what happens to a dn ale space under t-duality. this
issue has its own importance even besides its use for realizing gauge theories with branes and

2 it is interesting to look at congurations with orientifold planes and stuck 5 branes. the nature of the
orientifold plane changes as one crosses the 5 branes and strong coupling duals of such congurations lead to
interesting results.

it will be discussed in detail in this paper. it is natural to ask about theories with bn and cn

global symmetry. this is related to the understanding of strong coupling behavior of gop and
op+ planes. this will be discusses elsewere.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we review and extend the analysis of the
on 0 plane properties. we extensively discuss the behaviour of d-brane probes near the plane.
this section contains the technical tools that will be needed for all the examples in this paper.
the subsection 2.2 is more technical; since the results in this subsection will be used only for a
particular pair of mirror theories and for six-dimensional theories, the reader not interested in
these topics may skip this subsection. in section 3 we discuss the t-duality for an ale space
of type dn. in the following sections we discuss various examples of gauge theories in various
dimensions. in section 4 we present several examples of mirror pairs in n=4 three dimensional
gauge theories.
in section 5 examples of brane box models and nite n=1 gauge theories
in four dimensions. in section 6 examples of six-dimensional superconformal xed points and
small instanton theories. we tried to keep each dierent section as self-contained as possible,
in such a way that the reader only interested in a particular class of gauge theories or only
interested in t-duality for ale spaces may skip what does not interest him. for each class of
gauge theories we explicitly discuss t-dual descriptions and try to make contact with dierent
approaches.

2 the on 0 plane

a particularly important object for our purpose is the plane on 0, obtained as a superposition
of an on  plane and a physical ns brane. it arises both as the strong coupling limit of o5
planes and as an essential ingredient in the t-duality for d singularities.

its importance is increased by the fact that it has a perturbative description [6]. the on 0
plane can be considered as the xed plane of the perturbative (1)flr projection in a type ii
string theory. this orbifold projection is the combination of a space-time z2 inversion in four
directions, r, and the operator (1)fl, the left-handed space-time fermion number. there are
elds living on the world-volume of on 0. they are the twisted states of the orbifold projection,
which, both in type iia and type iib, have the same massless eld content as a ns-brane3.
on 0 acts as a sort of orientifold projection for ns-branes. n  1 physical ns-branes on
top of the on 0 plane realize an so(2n) symmetry; this is the standard gauge symmetry of
the system of ns-branes in type iib, or, the non-abelian symmetry acting on the tensionless
strings of the (2, 0) theory in type iia. notice that, in this description, one of the cartan
generators of so(2n) is not associated with the position of one of the ns branes but rather
with the twisted states of the orbifold projection4.

there are two properties of on 0 that make it special. they also explain the proposed

so(2n) symmetry:

3 the twisted states are vector supermultiplets of a (1, 1) six-dimensional theory in type iib and (2, 0)

tensor supermultiplets in type iia.

4 it is interesting to consider the brane realization of the bps spectrum of these theories. the w-bosons are
realized by d-strings, and the magnetically charged two-branes are realized by d3 branes. near the on 0, the
realization is dierent than the usual one near op planes. see gure 2 for some of these states.

figure 1: a graph consisting of commuting t and s dualities. the t-duality between type iia
at an orbifold singularity and type iib with ns-branes can be represented as two successive
strong-weak coupling dualities.

 s duality. in the type iib context, n  1 ns-branes near on 0 plane give the s-dual
realization of (1, 1) so(2n) six-dimensional theories with n physical d5-branes on top
of an orientifold plane. s-duality indeed maps d5-branes into ns-branes, and o5 planes
into on planes. on 0 is the strong coupling limit of the corresponding o50 plane, the
superposition of an o5 orientifold and a physical d5 brane [6]. as noticed in [6], the o50
plane, as opposed to o5 supports elds on its world-volume and it is not charged under
the rr six-form; it has therefore the right characteristic for being the strong coupling
limit of the orbifold xed plane.

 t duality. on 0 is also connected to the t-dual of a type iia dn singularity. the proposal
is that a t-duality along one of the directions of a type iia dn singularity is the type iib
orbifold r4/(1)flr in the presence of n  1 physical ns-branes. the gauge symmetry
is in both cases so(2n). the n twisted states of the dn type iia singularity, which
are (1, 1) six-dimensional vector multiplets, are mapped to the n  1 multiplets living
on the ns-branes in type iib plus the extra multiplet living on the plane on 0. this
proposal can be motivated by representing a t-duality as a combination of two strong-
weak coupling dualities, as depicted in gure 1. a background with a dn singularity
can be described as a particular decompactication limit of type iia on a singular k3,
which is dual to the type i string theory on t 4. in the relevant decompactication limit,
the dual theory can be represented as type iib on r4/r.
in this dual description,
the non-perturbative enhanced so(2n) gauge symmetry of type iia is described by n
physical d5-branes near an o5 orientifold plane. another s-duality now brings us back
to the type iib orbifold r4/(1)flr in the presence of ns-branes. similar arguments
apply for type iib singularities and type iia on planes and ns branes.

figure 2: two useful ways of thinking of on 0 planes.
in the s-dual description (gure b)
the dierent signs for the charges are explained by considering branes ending on the d5 brane
from the right or from the left. we may also put extra d5-branes (and ns-branes in the s-dual
conguration) for future reference. in gure a, we put two kinds of d5-branes (represented
as dots). one of them is bounded to the on 0 plane; in the s-dual picture (b) it has the
interpretation of a ns-branes which lives in between o5 plane and the d5-brane.

the importance of on 0 both as the strong coupling of o5 plane and as an ingredient in the
t-dual description of dn singularities is manifest in gure 1. as strong coupling of an o50
plane, on 0 plays an important role in the study of mirror symmetry in three dimensional
n = 4 gauge theories. as ingredient in the t-dual description of dn singularities, it plays an
important role in better understanding several brane congurations, varying from brane box
models to six-dimensional theories.

but, before constructing explicit examples, we need to explain what is the behavior of

d-branes in the presence of an on 0 plane.

2.1 d-branes in the presence of an on 0 plane

consider a dp-brane (p  6) transverse to the on 0 plane, or the type ii orbifold r4/(1)flr.
let us take, for deniteness, the r inversion acting on the coordinates 6, 7, 8, 9.

the crucial point is that the twisted sector of the (1)flr orbifold has the same eld
content as a ns-brane and, therefore, a d-brane can end on it. this means that the d-brane
is a source for the elds living at the xed plane5. as noticed in [6], d-branes ending on
the orbifold xed plane may have both positive and negative charge under the twisted elds;
moreover, congurations of parallel d-branes with dierent charges are supersymmetric [6, 7].
the reader should not confuse these negatively charged d-branes with anti d-branes. anti
d-branes have a negative charge under the ten-dimensional rr-forms. in this paper we always
consider d-branes. our branes are charged both under the ten-dimensional rr-form (with
positive charge) and under the six-dimensional twisted sector form (with positive or negative
charge).

the existence of dierent charges and the fact that supersymmetry is preserved can be
easily understood in the case p = 3 going to the s-dual conguration [6]. the result for

5 notice that this is dierent from the standard conguration in which a d-brane crosses an orientifold plane.
since the orientifold plane does not carry any eld on its world-volume, the d-brane is not really ending on it.

figure 3: two sets of d-branes (n1 with positive charge and n2 with negative charge) ending
on on 0 plane. the resulting gauge theory and matter elds are indicated below the gure. in
gure a there are two hypermultiplets in the bi-fundamental representation of the two gauge
groups. these hypermultiplets parametrize uctuations transverse to the orbifold plane. in
gure b, the two hypermultiplet is projected out by the presence of the ns brane.

general p follows from t duality. consider gure 2. in the s-dual picture, the orbifold plane
is represented by an orientifold o5 plane and a physical d5-brane which can be moved away
from the orientifold point. the twisted sector of the orbifold point are mapped to the elds
on the d5-brane. d3-branes ending on the orbifold plane are now ending on the d5-brane.
their charge under the d5-elds has a dierent sign according to whether they end to the
left or to the right of the d5-brane. we can identify the positively charged branes ending
on the orbifold plane with the d3-branes ending on the d5-brane from the right, while the
negatively charged branes with d3-branes coming from the right innity, going straight to
the orientifold, coming back and ending on the d5-brane from the left. this conguration is
manifestly supersymmetric.

n dp-branes ending on the xed plane, all of them with the same charge, have a world-
volume theory with eight supersymmetries consisting of a u(n) gauge theory. there are no
matter elds, since the hyper-multiplets corresponding to the uctuations transverse to the
orbifold plane are projected out by the action of r. the rules for projecting the open string
spectrum in the case with both positive and negative charges were found in [6, 7] by using
a boundary-state method. the rule is that, if there are n1 dp-branes with positive charge
and n2 dp-branes with negative charge ending on the xed plane, (1)flr acts on the open
string chan-paton factor as the conjugation by a diagonal matrix with n1 entries equal to +1
and n2 equal to 1. this means that the gauge elds (and their superpartners) coming from
open strings connecting d-branes with dierent charge are projected out and the gauge group is
u(n1)u(n2). the hyper-multiplets corresponding to open strings with both ends on d-branes
with the same charge are projected out being odd under r, but the ones associated with mixed

figure 4: the gauge theory can be read from the quiver diagram on the right. nodes represent
the gauge group factors, links represent bi-fundamental matter elds and external lines represent
elds in the fundamental representation of the corresponding gauge group.

open strings have an extra minus sign and survive giving matter elds in the bi-fundamental
(n1, n2) representation (gure 3). the same result can be obtained by looking at the s-dual
conguration described in gure 2.

in this paper we will need congurations with more ns-branes and with other dq-branes.
they are depicted in gure 4 a. when there are both dp and dq-brane, it is better to use
pictorial conventions in which dp-branes are horizontal lines, ns-branes are points and dq-
branes or oq planes are vertical lines. here q and the directions in which the dq-brane extend
are chosen in such a way that preserves supersymmetry in the presence of dp-branes; the
number of directions of type d-n in the open strings connecting dp and dq-branes must be
4. dp-dq congurations considered in this paper are the d3-d5 systems relevant for mirror
symmetry in three dimensions, the d5-d7 systems for brane box models, and the d6-d8
systems for the construction of six-dimensional theories.6 the dq-branes serve for introducing
matter elds in the fundamental representation of the various gauge groups. the world-volume
theory obtained in this way can be conveniently encoded in a quiver diagram, where nodes
represent the gauge group factors, links represent bi-fundamental matter elds and external
lines represent elds in the fundamental representation of the corresponding gauge group; the
quiver is depicted in gure 4 b.

the curious splitting of the dq-branes near on 0 requires some explanation. the w1 dq-
branes in gure 4 a are bounded to the on 0 plane. the existence of bounded branes can be
easily understood in the particular case of p = 3 and q = 5; in the s-dual picture of gure 2 b,
they are described by the ns-branes which live in between o5 and the d5-brane. it is obvious
from gure 2 that they only contribute avors to the u(p) gauge group. the w2 dq-branes are
instead mapped to ns-branes which live to the right of the d5-branes; they contribute avors
to both the u(p) and u(q) gauge groups.

the global symmetry for a generic gauge factor is u(wi). the gauge theory has a u(2w1) 
u(w2) symmetry for the factors associated with branes near on 0. notice that only a subgroup
usp(2w1)  u(w2) of this global symmetry is manifestly realized in the brane picture. further

in the case without vector structure (gure a), the states living on on 0 and
figure 5:
responsible for absorbing the charge of dp-branes are projected out by . therefore there is
only one type of dp-brane, living at the intersection of oq and op planes. this is the theory
discussed in [17]. in the case with vector structure (gure b), the surviving states living on
on 0 allow and require the existence of two kinds of dp-branes. each set of branes supports a
usp(k) group due to the existence of an op+ plane.

arguments in favor of this symmetry will be discussed in section 4.

this kind of quiver theories naturally represent a small u(w) instanton sitting on a dn ale
space [16]; here w is the total number of dq-branes. the conguration with ns-branes is the
t dual of the one considered in [16], as will be discussed in section 3. the form of the theory
is the same for every value of p.

2.2

including orientifold planes

in this subsection we further complicate our life by introducing an orientifold plane in addition
to on 0. this conguration will be used in section 4.4 for a particular class of mirror pairs
in three dimensions, and in section 6 for discussing six-dimensional theories. the reader not
interested in these examples can skip this subsection.

we now discuss the behavior of dp-branes near an on 0 plane when we also introduce an

oq plane to the picture.

in this paper, we consider on 0 as a perturbative orbifold projection; in this, it diers
very much from its natural partners, the ns-branes, which are solitonic objects. the oq
and the on 0 plane combine into a z2  z2 orbifold/orientifold projection, generated by rq
and (1)flr6789, where rq represents a z2 inversion in all the coordinates transverse to the
oq plane. we are using notation in which the on 0 plane extends along (012345) and the
dp-branes are stretched along (0, 1, . . . , p  1) and are possibly nite along x6. the oq plane
extends over the coordinates (0, 1, . . . , p  1) and (7, 8, 9). we will denote r6789, in short, r.

we now discuss what kind of theory is realized on dp-branes in this situation. the reader

10

not interested in technical details may want to skip the two following paragraphs dealing with
tadpoles, projections and all that, and look at gure 5. in the following we present two deriva-
tions for the massless elds in this conguration.

first derivation. every generator of the orbifold/orientifold projection acts on the chan-
paton factors of the d-branes according to the rules in [17, 16]. under a t-duality in the
directions p, .., 5 and 6 , the factor (1)fl disappears [18], and we recover a non-compact
version of the original model in [17]. as widely discussed in the literature [16, 19, 20, 21, 22],
there are essentially two dierent consistent models. they dier in the perturbative denition
of the  projection on the closed string twisted states and in the action of  on the chan-
paton factors. geometrically, they are distinguished by the type of so(2m) bundle that can
be dened on a space with a z2 singularity [19]. this so(2m) bundle is realized on the world-
volume of the dq-branes. a bundle dened on a space with a z2 singularity may admit vector
structure, or not. the original example in [17] does not admit vector structure. modications
that admit vector structure were constructed in [23, 19, 20, 21, 22]. the dierence between the
two cases is encoded in the following relation between the matrices that act on the chan-paton
factors [16, 20, 21, 22]:

[(1)fl r] = rq t

[(1)fl r]1

rq

with/without vector structure

(1)

since we put an oq plane, which by denition determines an so(2m) symmetry on the
world-volume of dq-branes, rq acts as the identity matrix on dq-branes [17]. the rule
that the symmetry of the matrix that projects dp-branes is opposite to the one that projects
dq-branes [17] is then enough to (almost) uniquely x the projection matrices, modulo an
irrelevant change of basis. the result is that, in the case without vector structure, the world-
volume theory for 2n dp-branes is u(n) with antisymmetric matter elds, and, in the case
with vector structure, is usp(2n)  usp(2n) with a bi-fundamental matter eld. the sign in
equation (1) is related to a global sign in the action of  on the closed string twisted sector. the
projection by rq breaks the lorentz-invariance of the six-dimensional theory of the twisted
states. to avoid confusion, it is better to work in the particular case in which p = 6, in which
this lorentz invariance is not broken; this is the conguration of d6 and d8 branes relevant
for the study of six-dimensional theories. the result for generic dp and dq-branes near on 0
follows from t-duality. the twisted sector provides a tensor multiplet and a hyper-multiplet. in
the case without vector structure the tensor multiplet is projected out and the hypermultiplet
survives [20]. the opposite happens in the case with vector structure. undoing the t-duality
for discussing the case with generic p, we discover that, in the case without vector structure, the
twisted state which may absorb the charge of a dp-brane is projected out by the  projection,
while in the case with vector structure it survives. the sign in equation (1) is also related to
the sign of the rr charge of the op plane that is induced in the theory. it is the standard op
plane in the case without vector structure, but it is op+ in the case with vector structure [20].
second derivation. in [14] we exploited a general method for studying the consistent
type ii and type i models, living at zn singularities, where dierences between the models
(presence or absence of vector structure) were manifest in a dual brane description. locally,
the system on 0  oq is indistinguishable from the generic z2 orbifold/orientifold, which was

studied in [14].
in the next sections, we will add more ns-branes and the methods in [14]
will not be sucient for describing the full system, but, at that time, we should already know
how to deal with on 0. the methods in [14] allow to study the possible z2 orbifold/orientifold
models in a t dual picture where the singularity is replaced by two ns-branes.

to avoid confusion, we again specialize our discussion to the case with p = 6; a t-duality
gives the result for generic p. the two ways of putting two ns-branes on a circle, respecting
the z2 symmetry, give two possible models, depicted in gure 6. the gauge group is, in the
case without vector structure, u(n) with antisymmetric matter, and, in the case with vector
structure, usp(n)  usp(n) with a bi-fundamental.
in the rst case, there are no tensor
multiplets, while in the second case there is one. applying a t-duality for recovering the case
with generic p, we discover that, in the case without vector structure, the twisted state which
may absorb the charge of a dp-brane is projected out by the  projection, while in the case
with vector structure it survives.

the results of this long analysis are summarized in gure 5. the results are consistent
with a naive extrapolation of the rules discussed in section 2.1 to the case with an orientifold.
the crucial point of the previous analysis is that the states associated with on 0, responsible
for the splitting of the branes, survive the orientifold projection only in the case with vector
structure. therefore, we can have two kinds of dp-branes, and the typical d-quiver splitting
only in the case with vector structure. in the case without vector structure, we have only one
kind of brane, which is projected according to the original example in [17].

consider now the addition of ns-branes. this gives the theory depicted in gure 7. we
face a lot of small subtleties. the following are the general rules for determining the matter
content:

1. at every ns-brane the charge of the op plane changes [24]. gauge groups associated to
2k dp-branes near op+ are usp(2k), while those associated to k branes near op are
so(k). the only exception occurs when an op crosses on 0; in this case the gauge
group associated to 2k dp-branes is u(k).

figure 7: the gauge theory can be read from the quiver diagram on the right. the bar on the
links means that they give rise to a half bi-fundamental.

2. the bi-fundamental (p, q) elds appearing in gure 5, associated to the branes near on 0,
are absent when the branes end on a ns-brane, since the latter freezes all uctuations
transverse to itself. this is the general case, unless one considers the degenerating exam-
ples associated to a singularity of type d2.

3. there are only half bi-fundamentals for the gauge groups usp  so. this is due to the

op projection. this rule does not apply for gauge groups usp  u or so  u.

4. the dq-branes can be partitioned among the ns-branes and give rise to matter elds in
the fundamental representation. wi dq-branes located where an op+ plane exists give
rise to an so(wi) global symmetry, while those located where an op plane exists give
rise to a usp(wi) global symmetry. this global symmetry teaches us that wi, (i 6= 1, 2)
2 avors. near on 0 (w1 and w2 ) there is a further splitting for
dq-branes give rise to wi
the dq-branes. this is analogous to the splitting encountered in section 2.1. the global
symmetry is so(2w1)  so(w2). the eld theory may get a bigger global symmetry
so(2w1 + w2)  so(w2) not seen by the branes.

this kind of quiver theories naturally represents small so(w) instanton on a dn ale space
[16]. the conguration with ns-branes is the t dual of the one considered in [16], as will
be discussed in section 3. the form of the theory is the same for every value of p.
in the
particular case p = 6 the world-volume theory is uniquely specied by the requirement of
anomaly cancellation. this will be exhaustively discussed in section 6.

3 t-duality for dn singularities

in this section, we discuss in more detail the t-dual of a dn singularity. it is well known that,
in type ii string theory, a t-duality along one of the directions of an ale space of type ak
transforms it into a type ii at background with k + 1 ns-branes [25]. as already anticipated,

figure 8: in gure a, the extended dynkin diagram for ak is depicted. the small numbers
near each node are the dynkin indices. each node is associated with a gauge group factor
and each link with a hypermultiplet in the bi-fundamental representation of the corresponding
groups. the resulting theory is u(n)k+1 with bi-fundamentals for neighboring u(n) factors.
the same theory can be obtained by considering gure b, which describes d-branes wrapped
around a circle and broken in between k + 1 ns-branes.

the proposal is that the t-dual conguration for an ale space of type dn is the type ii
orbifold r4/(1)flr in the presence of n  1 physical ns-branes.

in the ak case, the k + 1 twisted states of a zk+1 orbifold7 are mapped to the world-volume
elds of the k + 1 ns-branes8. in the dn case, the ns-branes world-volume elds provide the
dual description of only n  1 twisted states. the dual of the remaining twisted state comes
from the xed point of (1)flr; the twisted sector of (1)flr, both in type iia and type
iib, has indeed the same massless eld content as a ns-brane.

it is sometimes useful to replace the ale space with a taub-nut geometry (also called kk
monopole). globally the structure of an ale space is r4, that of a taub-nut space is r3 s1,
which makes it more suitable for performing t-dualities. the ale space can be recovered by
sending a parameter (which roughly measures the radius of the circle) to innity. the t-dual
of a dn kk monopole is the r3  s1/(1)flr orbifold with n  2 ns-branes. since there are
two xed points of (1)flr along s1, only n  2 ns-branes are now required to match the n
twisted states. the t-dual of the dn orbifold is obtained by sending the radius of the dual s1
to zero.

the proposal was motivated before using the chain of dualities depicted in gure 1. related
arguments can be found in earlier literature [18, 26], where it was noticed that the perturbative
t dual of the singular k3 manifold t 4/z2 is t 4/(1)flz2 and a description in terms of ns-
branes was proposed.

we can now ask what happens when we introduce d-brane probes in the picture. there is
an almost complete dictionary for determining the world-volume theory of d-branes sitting at

7 the twisted states are vector supermultiplets of a (1, 1) six-dimensional theory in type iia and (2, 0)

tensor supermultiplets in type iib.

8 ns-branes indeed support vector multiplets in type iib and tensor multiplets in type iia.

figure 9: in gure a, the extended dynkin diagram for dn is depicted. the small numbers near
each node are the dynkin indices. each node is associated with a gauge group factor and each
link to a hypermultiplet in the bi-fundamental representation of the corresponding groups. the
resulting theory is u(n)2  u(2n)n3  u(n)2 with bi-fundamentals for neighboring factors.
the same theory can be obtained by considering gure b, which describes d-branes wrapped
around a circle with two xed points, here depicted as a segment.

ale orbifold singularities [16]. n dp-branes sitting at a singularity of the form r4/g, where
g is a simply-laced group, have a world-volume theory that is associated with the extended
dynkin diagram for g, with a gauge factor for each node of the diagram and a bi-fundamental

matter eld for each link [16]. the gauge group is q u(nn), where n are the dynkin indices

for the group g. the higgs branch of these theories, which is the same for all p and is not
corrected by quantum eects, is the symmetric product of n copies of the ale space; this is
the brane realization [16] of the well known mathematical construction of the ale spaces as
hyperkahler quotients.

we should be able to see that the world-volume theory of d-branes probe is preserved by
the previously discussed t-duality. the analysis of the ak case is straightforward. n dp-branes
(p  6) sitting at a zk+1 singularity have a world-volume theory u(n)k+1 with bi-fundamentals
for neighboring u(n) factors. deforming the ale space to a taub-nut and performing a t-
duality along the s1, we obtain a conguration of n d(p + 1)-branes in the presence of k + 1
ns-branes, conguration that was discussed in [8] and reproduces the same world-volume theory
(gure 8).

that the t-duality process gives a consistent result also in the dn case can be now easily
shown using the results in the previous sections. the world-volume theory for 2n dp-branes
sitting at a dn singularity is u(n)2  u(2n)n3  u(n)2 with bi-fundamentals associated with
the links of the dn extended dynkin diagram (gure 9). after t-duality, we have a set of 2n
d(p + 1)-branes wrapped around a circle with two xed points under (1)flr. we can picture
the projected circle as a segment. we also have n  2 ns-branes. combining the methods in
[8] with those described above, it is straightforward to check that the theory associated to this
conguration of branes is the same as that associated to the dn extended dynkin diagram.

congurations in which m dq-branes are also present are interesting. we are considering
a situation in which the dp-probe is sitting at a point in the ale space, q = p + 4 and the
dq-brane is wrapped on the ale space. this conguration naturally describes n small u(m)
instanton on an ale space; the higgs branch of dp-branes world-volume theories, which is
the same for all values of p and is not corrected by quantum eects, is isomorphic to the n

instantons moduli space [16]. the case of so(2m) instantons is easily obtained by considering
an oq plane. after a t-duality, we obtain a conguration with d(p + 1), d(q  1) and ns-
branes. the world-volume theory can be read using the results in sections 2.1 and 2.2 and
agrees with the one discussed in [16]. the representation of small instantons sitting at space-
time singularities as systems of d and ns branes was discussed in [14] for the case of the ak
ale spaces. the replacement of space-time singularities with dual smooth backgrounds with
ns-branes has a double purpose. first, it allows to have a better control on parameters and
moduli of the theory. second, it provides a very simple and intuitive classications of the
gauge bundle compatible with the singularity; it naturally distinguishes between bundles with
or without vector structure and accounts for the breaking to a subgroup due to the singularity.
the analysis in [14] can be easily extended to the dn ale space using the results in sections 2.1
and 2.2. u(m) instanton theories are associated to the congurations in gure 4 and so(2m)
instanton theories to the congurations in gure 7; both the gures must be made compact by
including a second on 0 plane. once again, the disposition of the ns-branes on the segment
accounts for the allowed u(m) or so(2m) bundles and for the breaking of the gauge group to
a subgroup. the extension of the construction in [14] to the dn series is one of the achievements
of this paper, but we do not indulge more on this here, since section 6 will be devoted to the
subject. the small u(m) or so(2m) instanton at dn singularities will also appear in the
discussion about mirror symmetry.

4 mirror symmetry

the on 0 plane was used in [7] to explain three-dimensional mirror symmetry for usp(k) gauge
group coupled to a hypermultiplet in the second rank antisymmetric tensor representation and
n avors in the fundamental representation. the candidate mirror theory, associated with the
dn extended dynkin diagram, was guessed in [27] and demonstrated in [9], using m-theory.
however, a description in terms of the construction in [8] was still lacking and, with that,
something in our knowledge of the dictionary for translating general gauge theories in terms
of brane models was missing. the understanding of the strong coupling of o50 planes clearly
closes this gap [6, 7].

double cover of the projected space. the x symbol in the middle denotes an o5 plane. the
circles denote d5 branes. the vertical lines represent ns brane and its image, the horizontal
lines are d3 branes. figure b, drawn only on the physical plane, shows the higgs branch of
this theory, or alternatively the coulomb branch of the mirror. the branes in the gure are the
s-dual of the branes in gure a, with the same notation for the branes. the numbers below or
next to a set of horizontal lines denote the number of d3 branes in between two ns branes.

a dn quiver three-dimensional n = 4 gauge theory can be realized as in gure 10 a, as
extensively discussed in section 3. it is simple, using the rules in [8], to check that the mirror
theory is indeed usp(2k) with an antisymmetric and n avors [7]. an s-duality transforms ns-
branes into d5-branes and the on 0 plane into a combination of an o5 plane and a physical
d5-brane. as a result, an s-duality transforms the system in gure 10 a into a set of d3-branes
stretched between two o5 planes in the presence of n d5-branes, as depicted in gure 10 b.
this is a fairly standard conguration which realizes the above mentioned usp(2k) theory. for
more details, the reader is referred to [7]. we will shortly show many examples that should
make clear this type of construction.

4.1 examples

the examples that we explicitly discuss are:

 mirror of usp(2k) with n avors in the fundamental representation.

 mirror of usp(2k1)  usp(2k2) with a hypermultiplet in the bi-fundamental representa-
tion, n1 avors in the fundamental representation of the rst group and n2 avors in the
fundamental representation of the second group.

 mirror of u(2k) with one or two matter elds in the two-rank antisymmetric tensor

representation and n avors in the fundamental representation.

many other examples and generalizations are also outlined.

rank of the gauge factor in the gauge group. lines denote bi-fundamental hypermultiplets. a
line ending on an x denotes a hypermultiplet which is charged with respect to the corresponding
node it connects. later this will be called an external line.

4.1.1 mirror of usp(2k) with n flavors

the mirror theory was found in [28] using dierent methods; this serves as a check to our
method. later we will study other examples for which there are no known mirrors in the
literature. this demonstrates the power of this approach.

the procedure for calculating the mirror theory follows standard steps using the rules in
[8]. to move to the higgs branch of the original theory, one goes to the origin of moduli space,
namely to the region in which the d5 branes touch the d3 branes. once they touch, the d3
branes can split. figure 11 b shows the maximal splitting for the d3 branes. the splitting
is done taking into account that s-congurations are not supersymmetric. as a result the ns
brane, when located to the right of all branes has d3 brane tails connecting it to 2k d5 branes.
these tails do not represent massless modes in the eld theory. using the observation that the
position of the ns brane is not a relevant parameter for the low energy eld theory, we move the
ns brane to the left. whenever it crosses a d5 brane, a d3 brane is removed. after passing 2k
d5 branes the ns brane is located as in gure b. note that in gure b the ns-brane has been
denoted as a circle. this before denoted a d5 brane; we have indeed performed an s-duality.
at this point we learn that the gauge group in the segment where the circle is located gets an
extra hypermultiplet. the nal gauge group can be encoded into the quiver diagram depicted
in gure 12. the resulting gauge group is

u(k)2  u(2k)n2k1 

2k1y

i=1

u(i),

with matter as in the gure. note that the rst u(2k) factor has an additional hypermultiplet
which is only charged under this group.

4.1.2 mirror of usp(2k1)  usp(2k2)

the next example is the mirror of usp(2k1)  usp(2k2) with n1 avors in the fundamental
representation of the rst group, n2 avors in the fundamental representation of the second
group and a bi-fundamental. the brane conguration is obtained by considering two o5
planes; it is depicted, with the s-dual conguration, in gure 13 a. notice that we now switched
to dierent notations, which are more suitable for giving a synthetic description of compact

18

models; to avoid confusion we explicitly indicated the type of branes in the picture. the quiver
diagram for the mirror theory can be easily computed step-by-step using the rules in [8] and
it is shown in gure 13 b. the particular case k1 = k2 is almost trivial to compute; the reader
simply needs to exchange ns- and d5-branes and on 0 and o50 planes. the case k1 6= k2
requires also some attention to non-supersymmetric congurations and to move some of the
d5-branes; the needed steps are very similar to the ones discussed in the previous example.
the resulting gauge group is, (assuming k1 > k2 and n1 + 2k2 > 2k1 + 1),

u(k1)2  u(2k2)n12k1+2k21  


2k11y

i=2k2+1

u(i)


  u(2k2)n21  u(k2)2.

special attention is required for the cases n1 + 2k2  2k1 = 0, 1. without loss of generality,
we consider from now on k1 = k2. for n1 = 0, 1, one should analyze the global symmetry of
the three dimensional theory, interpreted as the world volume theory which lives on the ns
brane. for generic n1, the ns brane supports the usual (1,1) supersymmetric six dimensional
u(1) multiplet. this is even true for the case n1 = 1. for n1 = 0, we have enhanced symmetry
which can be seen before making the mirror operation. the ns brane has a modulus which
measures the distance from the o5 plane. when this distance goes to zero a w-boson, given
by d-string stretching between the ns brane and its image under the o5 plane, becomes
massless. the resulting group on the world volume of the ns brane is enhanced to usp(2).
more generally, n ns branes next to an o5 plane have an enhanced usp(2n) gauge theory
on their world volume. it should be noted that poincare invariance in six dimensions no longer
holds since the o5 plane breaks it explicitly. the world volume theory of the ns brane is then
a six dimensional theory with a point like singularity at three of its coordinates. this breaks
half of the supersymmetries in addition to the explicit breaking of six dimensional poincare
invariance.

the case n1 = 0 becomes even more special when we consider the conguration after making
the mirror transformation. the crucial point is that in the s-dual picture the orientifold plane
and a d5-brane combine into an on 0 plane. for n1 = 0, the ns-brane, which in the original
conguration lives between the orientifold and the d5-brane whose fate is to combine with it,
becomes, after s-duality, a d5-brane that is bounded to on 0. we already discussed this kind
of congurations in section 2.1. the enhanced symmetry on the world volume theory of the
d5 brane remains, as before the mirror transformation, a usp(2) gauge theory.

combining this with the symmetry on the world volume of the d5-branes, we get that
the global symmetry of the problem for n1 = 0 is usp(2)  so(2n2). for n1 6= 0 the global
symmetry is u(1)  so(2n1)  so(2n2). the knowledge of the global symmetry helps in
deriving the quiver diagram corresponding to the mirror theories. the diagrams for n1 = 0, 1
are drawn in gure 14 a and b.

4.1.3 su(nc) with antisymmetric matter and nf flavors.

we have seen that there are examples with no external lines, corresponding to gure 13, and
with two external lines (gure 14). the natural question to ask is how to get a quiver with only
one external line. the naive answer will be to get half of the case in gure 14 b. indeed one

quiver diagrams for the mirror theories.

needs to put a stuck ns brane on the o5 plane. this leads to a quiver with one external line
as required. what is the eld theory of this conguration of branes? well, the answer is fairly
standard. a stuck ns-brane gives a hypermultiplet in an anti-symmetric tensor representation.
on the other hand, the gauge theory on the d3 brane still remains a usp gauge theory since
it is projected on the other side of the interval. so we get a theory with the same matter
content as for the case with no external lines as in gure 13. it is a known phenomenon that
the presence of a single ns brane does not change the matter content but may make one of the
parameters in the theory manifest as a deformation of the brane conguration.

the brane congurations for su(2k) eld theories with antisymmetric matter are given in
gure 15 a. the steps for computing the mirror theories closely parallel those considered in
the previous examples. the computation in the compact case is almost trivial; in the non-
compact case, one needs to pay attention to non-supersymmetric congurations and move
branes around, closely paralleling what is done in section 4.1.1. the results for the mirror
theories can be conveniently encoded in the quiver diagrams shown in gure 15 b. there is no
enhanced symmetry associated to the stuck ns branes.

all the considered compact models are associated to a dn extended dynkin diagram, dec-
orated with one or two external lines. a convenient classication of these kind of theories is
given by looking at the global symmetry; we discussed examples with global symmetry that is
a subgroup of usp(2)  so(2n). the maximally symmetric case is the one in gure 14 a. in
the original theories (and with this we mean the theories realized as congurations of branes
with orientifold planes) the so(2n) subgroup symmetry is manifestly realized as the symmetry

21

that rotates the avors transforming in the fundamental representations of the gauge groups;
in general, this symmetry is reduced to so(2n1)  so(2n2). the usp(2) symmetry instead
is not manifest classically, as standard in mirror symmetry [29]; it makes its appearance as
an ir symmetry, and, in general, is reduced to u(1). alternatively, if one turns on a mag-
netic gauge coupling, the symmetry is present only at innite magnetic gauge coupling.
in
the mirror theories instead the so(2n) subgroup symmetry is not manifest classically, while
the usp(2) symmetry (or, generically, its u(1) subgroup) rotates the avors corresponding
to external lines. these symmetries can be also read from the brane congurations as the
symmetries on the world-volume of ns- and d5-branes. all these symmetries are pictori-
ally manifest in the quiver diagram of the mirror theory; so(2n) is associated with the dn
dynkin-diagram form of the graphs and usp(2) rotates the external lines. the number and
the position of the external lines also accounts for the reduction of this symmetry group to a
generic u(1)  so(2n1)  so(n2) subgroup.

a natural question is: what is the mirror of the theory corresponding to a dn quiver diagram
with up to k external lines arbitrarily distributed among the nodes? the answer is not dicult
to nd using the results in the previous sections: we need to consider the case with more ns-
branes and make a diagrammatic computation with the rules we discussed. the result will be
presented in section 4.3. but, rst, let us make some general remarks and try to make contact
with dierent approaches.

4.2 discussion and relation to other approaches

the step-by-step rules for computing mirror pairs, which we discussed in the previous sections,
can be applied to a large variety of theories. in this section, we discuss few general issues about
our results and consider examples that have a t-dual description and allow to make contact
with dierent approaches.

all the previous pairs of mirror theories pass the simplest consistency check: the dimension
of the coulomb branch of the theory is equal to the dimension of the higgs branch of its mirror,
and vice versa. the number of masses and fi terms is also consistent with the mirror symmetry
expectations, except that in the case of the theories depicted in gure 14. the usp(2k)2 theory
for n1 = 0, 1 indeed has a missing fi term. a similar phenomenon was encountered in [9] and
also in [7], in the analysis of d2 and d3 quiver diagrams. a possible resolution of this paradox
is that the usp(2k)2 theory has a hidden fi parameter which is not visible in the classical
lagrangian and appears only when the theory ows in the ir to an interacting superconformal
xed point.

the reader may have noticed that the theories usp(2k)2 and u(2k) with antisymmetric
tensors can be interpreted as the world-volume theory of so(2n) small instantons sitting at a
z2 singularity [21, 22, 14]. the representation of these small instanton theories as systems of
ns-, dp- and dq-branes was extensively discussed in [14, 15]; a t-duality along x6 transforms
the ns-branes into a space-time singularity, and the conguration of d-branes into a system
of d2- and d6-branes, which have a natural interpretation as small instanton theories. in this
approach the orientifold-invariant dispositions of two ns-branes on a segment accounts for all
the possible breaking of so(2n) to subgroups and the type of allowed bundles (with or without

22

vector structure) [14]. using the discussion in section 3, it is not dicult to see that also the
mirror theories have the natural interpretation, in the spirit of [14], as the world-volume theory
of su(2) small instantons sitting at a dn singularity. once again, modulo minor dierences
due to the presence of on 0, the disposition of the ns-branes on the segment accounts for the
allowed global symmetry bundle. we see that the gauge group of the instanton theory and the
group associated to the singularity are exchanged by mirror symmetry. this is not a fortuitous
coincidence.

in [9] mirror symmetry was studied by realizing the gauge theories with congurations of
d2- and d6-branes, and lifting them to systems of membranes sitting at orbifold singularities in
m theory. this approach can be useful for studying the n=4 three-dimensional superconformal
xed points using the tools of the ads/cft correspondence [30, 31]. the compact examples
considered in the previous sections can be reduced to congurations of d2- and d6-branes by
performing a t-duality along x6 and using the results of section 3. consider only the case
in which there is the same number of d3-branes everywhere; more general congurations are
associated with fractional branes sitting at orbifold singularities. we obtain systems of d2-
branes sitting at a g singularity in the presence of d6-branes realizing a g global symmetry,
where g and g are su(n) or so(2n); these theories are the world-volume theories of small g
instantons sitting at a g singularity. mirror symmetry correspond to the exchange of g with
g. the system can be lifted to a set of membranes in m-theory with a g  g singularity;
mirror symmetry is then reduced to the geometrical symmetry that exchanges g with g. the
argument is general and simple; unfortunately, the three-dimensional theory is not completely
specied until we specify the form of the g bundle on the g ale space, since in general
the global symmetries g and g are broken to subgroups by the choice of a bundle. the case
analyzed in the previous sections corresponds to the singularity z2dn. the mutual disposition
of ns- and d5-branes in both the original and the mirror theory determines a particular bundle,
with a given global symmetry; in the case of the d-type quiver diagram, the disposition of the
external lines gives a pictorial description of this bundle. the type iib description is useful
for describing the most general bundle, and, more than that, provides a step-by-step method
for computing the bundle for the mirror theory once the original one is given. moreover, the
type iib description can be easily used also for congurations containing fractional branes.

finally, we notice that interesting eects are associated with the singular cases of d2 and d3
singularities. in this paper we do not discuss these cases; however, they are easily realized using
the methods discussed in this section. the case of a d2 singularity is particularly interesting
since it provides examples of theories that are dual (in the sense that they ow to the same ir
xed point) at specic points in moduli space [32, 33]. the reason is that a d2 singularity splits
into two a1 singularities. the m-theory lift of two d6-branes near an orientifold is the space
(r3  s1)/z2. the two xed points of z2 correspond, in general, to dierent superconformal
xed points and the three-dimensional gauge theory may ow to one or the other according
to the vacuum expectation value of the scalar parameterizing the position in s1.
it is not
immediately obvious how these eects can be seen in the type iib description we are using in
this paper.

figure 16: in gure a there are a total of pi pi = n d5-branes and a total of m ns branes
(carrying m
2 magnetic ns charge). the ns-branes are put on the segment in an orientifold-
invariant way. stuck ns-branes on the orientifolds can be present or not; this has been denoted
1  usp(k) with bi-fundamentals and n
using unlled circles. the theory is usp(k)  u(k)
fundamentals distributed among the gauge factors, or analogous theories in which one or both
the usp(k) factors are replaced by u(k) with an antisymmetric tensor, if there are one or two
stuck ns-branes, respectively. the mirror theory is depicted in gure b; the dn quiver diagram
has a maximum number m of external lines.

4.3 the case with zm  dn global symmetry

in this section we consider examples with global symmetry of type zm  dn. in the original
congurations of branes constructed with orientifolds, these models are obtained by adding
more ns-branes to the examples considered in section 4.1; in terms of the mirror theories, they
are obtained by adding external lines to the dn quiver diagram.

consider only compact congurations. non compact ones, which end with a ns-brane, can
be extended to compact one by adding a second orientifold plane. as it should be clear from
the examples in section 4.1, the mirror transform of a non-compact model can be obtained by
the mirror transform of the corresponding compact one, by substituting the right part of the
quiver diagram with a standard pattern of nodes associated to groups with decreasing rank, as
depicted in gure 12.

we consider only, for simplicity, congurations with the same number of d3-branes every-
where. these are the kind of congurations that have a known t-dual description. the reader
has all the elements for analyzing more complicated examples.

consider gure 16 a. m ns-branes can be put on the segment in an orientifold-invariant
fashion in several ways [14, 15]. if m is odd, there must be a stuck ns-brane; each of the [m/2]
physical branes living not at the boundary of the segment has an image under the orientifold
projection. if m is even, we can put m
2 physical branes on the segment far from the boundary
(case with vector structure) or we can put two stuck and m
2  1 physical ns-branes (case
1  usp(k) with bi-fundamentals
without vector structure). the theory is usp(k)  u(k)
and n fundamentals distributed among the gauge factors, or analogous theories in which one or
both the usp(k) factors are replaced by u(k) with an antisymmetric tensor; the replacement
occurs if there are one or two stuck ns-branes, respectively. these theories represent small
so(2n) instantons sitting at a zm singularity [21, 22, 14].

the mirror is a dn quiver theory with an arbitrary distribution of a maximum of m funda-
mentals among the nodes. the exact mirror can be easily derived using the rules discussed in
section 4.1.

these pairs of mirror theories are associated to m-theory singularities of the form zm  dn.
these theories have been also considered in [9] in the simplied case in which k = 1 and the
maximal global symmetry is not broken 9. the discussion in this section provides a general
method for studying generic bundles and for determining the particular theory that corresponds
to a generic diagram with a given distribution of external lines among the nodes.

the discrepancy between the number of parameters of the theories and of their mirrors
mentioned in section 4.2 is even increased for k > 2. some fi terms are missing; this was also
noticed in [9].

4.4 the dn  dk global symmetry and self-dual models

we nish our discussion about mirror symmetry by considering the class of theories realized
using both on 0 and orientifolds planes. consider, for example, gure 7. the three dimensional
gauge theories that can be realized using these congurations are encoded in the quiver diagrams
shown in the gure. we may ask: what is the strong coupling limit of these congurations?
luckily enough, the answer is very simple; since on 0 and o50 are exchanged by s-duality, the
mirror conguration has a form similar to the original one. it is encoded in a quiver diagram of
the same form, with dierent numbers wi and dierent dispositions of external lines. consider
only, for simplicity, compact models and congurations with the same number of d3-branes
everywhere.

the maximally allowed global symmetry is so(2n)so(2k), where k = p wi. the disposi-
tion of external lines breaks this global symmetry to a subgroup so(w1)so(w2)usp(w3)
usp(w4)    . this is the world-volume theory of an so(2k) small instanton sitting at a dn
singularity. the corresponding m-theory singularity is dn  dk. using the explicit s-duality,
with the rules explained in the previous sections, or using the arguments in [9], we conclude that
the mirror theory has the form in gure 17, but with k and n interchanged. the precise number
and disposition of external lines can be determined by an explicit (and easy) computation.

it is natural to consider self-dual examples. if k = n, choosing suitable values for wi, we
easily obtain self-dual theories. in other words, we can consider these congurations as obtained
by the orbifold generated by {(1)flr6789, r3456}; this is the meaning of having both on 0
and o50, as discussed in section 2.2. under an s-duality,  and (1)fl are interchanged. the
orbifold is therefore unaected by an s-duality combined with the interchange of (345) with
(789) (this are the rules of the game [8]!); congurations in which the total d5-charge and the
total ns-charge, as well as their disposition in space-time, are the same (this certainly implies
k = n) are therefore expected to be self-dual.

9 the proposal in [9], when compared to the one in this section, has an interchange between theories with
vector structure and theories without. this happened since, in those days, there was no explicit method for
computing the mirror theories in the case of dn global symmetries, and the result was guessed on the basis
of the m-theory intuition, the symmetry of the problem and the counting of parameters.
in this paper we
presented a method for explicitly computing the mirror theory.

4.5 open problems

there are open questions which are not solved by the current methods we use. there are two
basic unsolved questions.

the mirror of so gauge theories and their generalizations. we refer to congurations which
involve o3+ or o5+ planes. it is not clear at the moment how to understand the mirror of
these planes and this is the source for the confusion.

there are two basic constructions of usp gauge theories using d3 branes, d5 branes and ns
branes. one construction uses an o3+ plane and the other one an o5 plane. in both cases the
resulting gauge group is usp. correspondingly, the type iib s-dual of both congurations is
expected to give the known dual. currently only one conguration gives a satisfactory answer.
the one with an o5 plane. the conguration with o3+ is not understood well enough to
produce the right mirror.

5 four dimensional theories

5.1 brane box models

it is almost straightforward to introduce an on 0 plane in the brane box models studied in
[10]. consider gure 18. there are d5-branes extending in (012346), ns-branes and on 0
planes extending in (012345) and ns-branes extending in (012367). the model has n = 1
supersymmetry and is generically chiral. the generic box ni,j gives rise to the gauge group
u(ni,j). the open strings connecting neighboring boxes give rise to chiral matter elds in
the fundamental (or anti-fundamental) representation of the neighboring gauge groups. these
matter elds and their chirality are depicted using oriented arrows. only arrows directed and
oriented east, north and south-west exist [10]. all the existing matter elds are indicated for
the box ni,j. every time three arrows close a triangle there is a cubic superpotential [10]. the
only novelty regards the boxes near on 0, for example ni,0 and ni,1. as we can expect from

figure 18: a generic brane box model with on 0 planes. the matter elds in the fundamental
or anti-fundamental representation, which are represented as oriented arrows, are indicated for
two particular boxes. the boxes near on 0 are split into two u(n) gauge factors. the matter
elds for u(ni,1) are indicated as standard arrows, while those for u(ni,0) are indicated as
dashed arrows. if ni,j = 2n for j 6= 0, 1 and ni,0 = ni,1 = n, there is no bending and the
one-loop beta function is zero. under the same condition, if the model is compact in both the
horizontal and vertical direction, the theory is nite and related under t-duality to d3-branes
near an orbifold of c 3 generated by zk and dn, where k is the number of ns-branes and n  2
is the number of ns-branes.

section 2, there is a splitting into two gauge factors u(ni,0) and u(ni,1). the action of (1)fl
on the chan-paton factors is a diagonal matrix with entries +1 for the indices associated to
ni,0 and 1 for those associated to ni,1. as a consequence, the open strings connecting, say,
ni,0 with ni1,1 are projected out. the resulting spectrum is indicated in gure 18 for the
box ni,1 and ni,0; the standard arrows represent the matter elds for the gauge group u(ni,1),
while the dashed arrows represent the matter elds for u(ni,0).

the numbers ni,j must be chosen in order to have an anomaly-free model. anomalies on
the world-volume of the branes should be related to the violation of the equations of motion
for some space-time eld. due to the complexity of the model and the non-trivial bending of
the ns and ns-branes, the precise relation between anomalies and charge conservation of the
string background is not known. attempts to nd such a relation appeared in the literature
[34, 35, 36, 37] without a conclusive result. in principle, it may happen that, even if the number
nij are such that they cancel anomalies, the branes background is inconsistent. however, the
consistency of a large class of brane box models can be explicitly checked by t dualizing them
to other consistent systems of branes sitting at orbifold singularities [12, 36]. the class of
consistent models can be enlarged by considering models which are separately well dened and
sewing them [34, 35, 36, 37].

there is an obvious example that is well dened. if we take the same number of d5-branes
in each box there is no bending for the ns-branes and the space-time equations of motion are
satised. this corresponds to ni,j = 2n for j 6= 0, 1 and ni,0 = ni,1 = n. the condition of

27

no bending is equivalent to vanishing of the total charge of the d5-branes ending on a given
ns and ns-branes. the analogous condition for the on 0 plane forces us to take ni,0 = ni,1.
since the bending is associated to the running of the coupling constant [38], this model has
zero one-loop beta function [11]. every gauge group u(n) , including those realized near on 0,
has indeed 3n elds in the fundamental and 3n in the anti-fundamental representation. the
quantum eld theory is conjectured to be nite using the same argument of non-bending as in
[11].

5.2 relation to branes at orbifold singularities and finite models

we can easily construct cylindrical (6 direction compact) and elliptical (6 and 4 directions
compact) models. these kind of models can be related by t-duality to systems of branes at
orbifold singularities [10, 11, 12]. consider n  2 ns-branes and k ns-branes. according to
the discussion in section 3, we expect that the ns-branes are replaced by a t-duality along
the 4 direction with an a-type singularity and the ns-branes and the on 0 planes are replaced
by a t-duality along the 6 direction with a d-type singularity. the cylindrical models are the
t dual of systems of d4 and ns-branes at a dn orbifold singularity extended in the directions
6, 7, 8, 9 [10, 39]. the elliptical models are the t dual of systems of d3-branes sitting at a c 3
orbifold; the actual orbifold group is the smallest discrete group acting on c 3 that contains a
zk subgroup acting on the coordinates 4, 5, 8, 9 and a dn subgroup acting on the coordinates
6, 7, 8, 9. to preserve n = 1 supersymmetry, this discrete group must be a subgroup of su(3)
[40]. it would be quite interesting to further analyze the relation between the brane box models
and the construction in [40].

when ni,j = 2n for j 6= 0, 1, n, n  1 and ni,0 = ni,1 = ni,n1 = ni,n = n, the d3-branes
transforms in the regular representation of the orbifold group [16]. however, in general, the
numbers ni,j do not need to be all equal. we may project the d3-branes with a dierent
representation. this would result in having fractional d3-branes. the anomaly cancellation
becomes now equivalent to the tadpole cancellation [36].

we may obtain more complicated orbifold singularities by compactifying in the 6 direction
allowing for a shift along the 4 direction [12]. the shift must be compatible with the z2
projection induced by on 0. it appears that the brane box models give a simple construction
of the gauge theory and the superpotential of some of the theory associated with discrete groups
of su(3). it would be interesting to analyze the dictionary for translating these kind of models
into an orbifold projection, along the lines of [12, 40].

it is believed that the properties of niteness improve if the models are compact [11, 12]. if
we take ni,j = 2n for j 6= 0, 1, n, n  1 and ni,0 = ni,1 = ni,n1 = ni,n = n and compactify
along the 6 direction, allowing for some shift, we obtain a nite and conformal n = 1 model. as
we said, this is mapped by t-duality to a set of d3-branes sitting at an orbifold singularity. the
niteness of this model then follows from the ads/cft correspondence using the arguments
in [41].

28

6 six-dimensional theories

in this section we discuss examples of six-dimensional gauge theories.

there are several consistent string backgrounds that give rise to anomaly-free six-dimensional
theories [42, 43, 44, 17, 23, 21, 22]. in [14] we described a realization with d6-, d8- and ns-
branes. the introduction of an on 0 plane in the original construction in [13, 14, 15] allows
to realize more complicated examples. this section completes the results in [14]. it also shows
how to construct (in the spirit of [8] ) the gauge theories associated to small so(32) instantons
sitting at dn singularities.

in section 2, we discuss in detail what is the world-volume theory of dp-branes ending on
ns-branes and on 0 planes.
in the case of d6-branes, we must include the elds living on
ns-branes or on 0 planes in the six-dimensional theory and we must also pay attention to
the anomaly cancellation conditions. as a general rule, an anomaly in eld theory translates
in the brane set-up to the non-conservation of some charge for bulk elds. in this particular
case, the relevant charges are associated to the elds living on the ns-branes; for a remarkable
return, the same elds provide the tensor multiplets that are necessary to completely cancel
the anomalies in six-dimensions.

the general discussion about anomaly cancellation in the brane set-up can be found in
[45, 14]. the general rule will be clear after considering a specic example. the six-dimensional
theory corresponding to gure 3b is still u(n1)  u(n2) without bi-fundamentals, but now with
two tensor multiplets and two hyper-multiplets coming from the ns-brane and the on 0 plane.
naively, one would think that only one linear combination of these multiplets is relevant for the
eld theory, arguing that the sum of the two multiplets decouples while the dierence appears
as a gauge coupling and fi parameter, respectively, for both gauge groups. however, this is not
true. the two tensor multiplets and two hypermultiplets couple both to the gauge theory. the
sum of the multiplets couples to, say, the gauge group on the d6 branes which have positive
charged with respect to the on 0 multiplet while the dierence of the multiplets couples to
the gauge group associated with the negatively charged d6 branes. the theory in gure 3 is
generally anomalous. a u(n) theory with nf avors indeed is anomalous unless nf = 2n
and the theory is coupled to a tensor multiplet, the scalar of which plays the role of a gauge
coupling. it is easy to see what is wrong with charge conservation for bulk elds. since the
world-volume of the d6-brane is bigger than that of a ns-brane, the rr-charge of the d6-brane
can not be absorbed by the ns-brane as it happens for all the dp-branes ending on a ns-brane
for p  5. therefore the d6 charge must be canceled locally at the position of the ns-brane.
in this case, there are n1 + n2 d6-branes on the left of the ns-brane and zero on the right and
the charge is not conserved10.

there are two ways of removing the obstacle and constructing an anomaly-free theory.
they are depicted in gure 19. notations are changed with respect to gure 3. since the

10 notice that, while a dp-brane may have positive or negative charge under the elds living on on 0 [6], the
charge under the ns-brane elds is always positive for branes ending, say, on the left. we are not considering
anti dp-branes in our picture; they would break supersymmetry. actually, one can interpret sens assignment
of positive and negative charges as being ending to the left or to the right of the on 0 plane, respectively as
in gure 2.

figure 19: the standard gure for a six-dimensional theory. d6-branes are depicted as horizon-
tal lines ending on points corresponding to ns-branes (lled circles) and on 0 planes (empty
circles). d8-branes are depicted as vertical lines.

d6-worldvolume is bigger than the ns one, it is better to represent d6-branes as lines ending
on points which represent ns-branes. in gure a, we added n1 + n2 semi-innite d6-branes to
the right of the ns-brane in order to preserve the charge. the two kinds of d6-branes ending
on on 0 have opposite charge with respect to the elds living on it and we must cancel the on 0
tadpole by taking n1 = n2. the resulting theory is u(n)  u(n) with 2n avors for each group,
two tensor multiplets and two hypermultiplets. the tensor multiplets are necessary to cancel
the non-abelian anomalies [46] while the hypermultiplets, acting as dynamical fi terms, cancel
the abelian anomalies, making the u(1) factors massive [16, 19]. in gure b, we also added
d8-branes, depicted as vertical lines. they induce a cosmological constant, which is constant in
space-time and jumps by one unit when one crosses a d8-brane [47]. a non-zero cosmological
constant m induces an eective rr seven form charge at the position of a ns-brane. this
changes the charge conservation condition in the following way: the d6 charge on the left of a
ns-brane minus the d6 charge on the right must equal the value of the cosmological constant
at the position of the ns-brane11: nl  nr = m [45, 14]. the cosmological constant is zero near
on 0 implying again n1 = n2. it is instead equal to m near the ns-brane implying that we
must add 2nm semi-innite d6-branes to its right. the resulting theory is again u(n) u(n)
with 2n avors for both groups, two tensor multiplets and two hypermultiplets.

equipped with the rules discussed in section 2, we can construct more general examples.
adding ns-branes to the initial on 0 plane, without including orientifolds, we obtain theories
that are products of u(n) gauge groups. this kind of examples are exhaustively discussed in
[14].

introducing an o8 plane, we can construct many more examples, containing, in particular,

the congurations t dual to so(w) small instantons on dn ale spaces.

compact model with two on 0 planes are associated to small instanton theories, as discussed
in section 3. in the six-dimensional case, we must pay attention to the anomaly cancellation,
which usually constrains the world-volume theory. theories of small u(n) or so(2n) instan-
tons living at a dn singularity are associated with a dn extended dynkin diagrams as in gure
9 with the addition of external lines as in gure 4, for u(n), or gure 7, for so(2n). the

11 we are using conventions in which a physical d6-brane counts +1 and a physical d8-brane induces a

cosmological constant of magnitude +1.

figure 20: the anomaly cancellation rule near on 0. on 0 is represented as the pair containing
a xed plane and a virtual ns-brane.

n tensors and hypermultiplets required to cancel both non-abelian and abelian anomalies are
automatically provided by the n  2 ns-branes and the two on 0 planes.

the introduction of an o8 plane aects our picture much more than in the original ex-
amples in [14]. the general strategy in [14] was to replace every space-time singularity with a
dual background where the singularity was replaced by branes. this in general allows to have
a better control on the parameters and moduli of the theory. in the case of dn singularities,
we will have a mixed picture, with both ns-branes and the perturbative orbifold projection
associated to on 0 plane.

the generic quiver theory in the presence of o8 plane was already discussed, for arbitrary
dimension, in section 2.2 (gure 7). the form of the world-volume theory does not depend on
the dimension. what is peculiar to six-dimensions is that the anomaly cancellation uniquely
determines the world-volume theory. moreover we need to include elds from the ns-branes and
from the twisted sectors in the theory; they are crucial for canceling the anomalies. recall from
section 2.2, that there are two consistent congurations of d-branes living at the intersection
of an o8 and an on 0 plane. the rst one has an o6 plane, no splitting of branes, u-type
gauge groups and an hypermultiplet from the twisted states. the second one has an o6+
plane, a splitting with usp-type gauge groups and a tensor multiplet from the twisted states.
in six-dimensions, it is crucial to keep track of the twisted sectors, since they contribute to the
theory and are important in canceling the anomalies.

the actual gauge groups (the numbers p, q, t, s, ... in gure 7) can be determined by the
rr-charge conservation condition, which is equivalent to the anomaly cancellation [14]. we
recall that we are using notations where o8 contributes 8 to the cosmological constant and
o6 has rr-charge 4. the only new ingredient, not present in [14], is the condition that
must hold near on 0. the total charge for the on 0 twisted tensor eld must be canceled, since
there is no room for the d6-brane rr-charge to escape. this xes the splitting (the numbers
p and q) near on 0. the rule is that p  q = w1. it is easily checked that it is equivalent to the
anomaly cancellation condition; we give an explicit example below. this result would surely

figure 21: the so(32) small instanton theory for d4 and d5 singularities. for simplicity,
we considered an so(32) unbroken group, obtained by putting all the 16 d8-branes at the
same point, near on 0. the case for general breaking of the global symmetry group follows by
partitioning the d8-branes in between the ns-branes. the charge conservation rules described
in the text uniquely x the world-volume theory. the generalization to an arbitrary dk is
obvious.

follow from a careful analysis in terms of boundary states, along the lines of [6]. we prefer
to give a heuristic argument in the spirit of the s-dual picture of gure 2. it is convenient to
represent the on 0 plane as splitted into a xed plane and a virtual ns-brane which supports
the twisted elds (see gure 20). the w1 dq-branes now live on the left of the virtual ns-
brane. we assume that the virtual ns-brane behaves at all eects as a real ns-brane. this
means that the orientifold plane o6 change sign in crossing it. more important, the anomaly
cancellation condition for the on 0 plane is mapped to the standard condition for a ns-brane.
the cosmological constant at the virtual ns-brane is 8 + w1, where 8 is the contribution of
o8. the condition is (2p  4)  (p + q + 4) = 8 + w1, which is the same as p  q = w1; the
4 are the contribution of the o6 plane on the right and on the left of the virtual ns-brane,
respectively.

it is quite easy to construct compact models by putting another o8 plane in the six
direction and taking p wi = 16. this will describe the t dual version of so(32) small instantons
sitting at dn singularities [21, 22, 48]. the theory will change according to where we add the
o8 plane. if n is even12, o8 will intersect an o6+; therefore we will need the prescription in
gure 5 b. if n is odd, o8 will intersect an o6 plane and we will need gure 5 a. the resulting
theory is the same as the one discussed in [21, 22, 48]. in gure 21 we depicted the theory
associated with small instantons for d4 and d5. the general theory for arbitrary n should be
obvious from these examples; it is associated to an extended (ane) dynkin diagram of d-type

12 we know from section 1 that for the description of a dn singularity we need n  2 ns-branes and two on 0

planes.

32

for n even, and to a standard (without the extra node) dynkin diagram of d-type for n odd13.
charge conservation xes the gauge groups in such a way to cancel all the anomalies. as an
example of the application of the previous rules, we consider the d4 example in gure 21.

we put w1 = 16 and all the other wi = 0. there is a total of four conditions.

1. near the rst on 0; the previously discussed condition is 2k  2p = w1 = 16.

2. near the rst ns-brane. o6 contributes a +4 rr-charge on the left and 4 on the right.
the cosmological constant is 8 + w1 = 8, where 8 is the contribution of o8. the
condition is (2k + 2p + 4)  (2q  4) = 8.

3. near the second ns-brane: (2q  4)  (2r + 2t + 4) = 8.

4. near the last on 0, where there are no d8-branes: 2r  2t = 0.

this set of four equations determines the world-volume content indicated in gure 21. the
theory is anomaly free14. for n even, the theory contains n tensor multiplets (n  2 ns-branes
and two on 0 planes intersecting o6+ planes); for n odd, n  1 tensor multiplets and one fi
hypermultiplet (on 0 intersecting o6). this is exactly what is required to cancel the abelian
and non-abelian anomalies.

6.1 generalizations

we can easily construct generalizations of the small instanton theories and build new models.
a rst example is easily obtained by constructing theories in which the on 0 plane always
intersects an o6 plane. there is no splitting of branes near on 0 and the quiver diagram is a
simple line of nodes. this conguration is allowed only if n is even. the world-volume theories
are of the form,

u(k1)  usp(k2)  so(k3)      usp(kn2)  u(kn1),

(2)

with bi-fundamentals or half bi-fundamentals for neighboring factors and fundamentals for the
various gauge groups. this model was already considered in [14]. the numbers ki are easily
determined using the rules found in the previous section. after orientifold projection, the two
on 0 planes provide the two fi hypermultiplet needed for canceling the abelian anomalies and
the ns-branes provide the n  2 tensor multiplets needed for the non-abelian anomalies. we
can speculate that these theories correspond to a geometrical so bundle at a dn singularity
without vector structure, which indeed exists only for n even. we did not nd the explicit
construction of theories without vector structure for d-singularities in the literature, but it

13 to be precise, if we consider the geometrical construction of these theories in [21, 22], we realize that, for
n odd, it is not the extended node of the diagram that is missing, but the last two nodes (the n  1th and nth)
are identied.

14 recall that a u sp(nc) theory is anomaly free if nf = nc + 8, while an so(nc) theory is anomaly free if

nf = nc  8. in both cases, a tensor multiplet is needed to completely cancel the anomaly.

would not be too dicult to construct them using the methods in [21, 22]. in gure 22 we
depicted the d4 example. the generalization to dn is straightforward.

a second obvious generalization involves the introduction of an o8+ plane. it has charge
+8, therefore if we have both o8 and o8+ in a compact model there is no need for d8-branes.
the discussion about the properties of o8  on 0 planes is invariant under the simultaneous
change of sign of the charge of the o8 and o6 planes. this means that there are two consistent
congurations of d-branes living at the intersection of an o8+ and an on 0 plane. the rst one
has an o6+ plane, no splitting of branes, u-type gauge groups and a hypermultiplet from the
twisted states. the second one has an o6 plane, a splitting with so-type gauge groups and
a tensor multiplet from the twisted states. in the case of a dn singularity, we obtain standard
d-type dynkin diagrams for n odd, and extended (ane) d-type dynkin diagrams for n even.
this is the opposite of what we found when the two o8 planes had both the same negative
charge. the d4 and d5 cases are depicted in gure 23.

we discussed several examples. they are complete in the sense that they cover all the
possible congurations which contain on, o8 and o6 planes. by combining in a dierent
way the various players of this game, we can construct many other compact and non-compact
models. the rules we gave in the previous section for determining the world-volume theory will
always produce a consistent anomaly-free six-dimensional theory with a non-trivial xed point.
we will not discuss the applications of what we said to all the rich aspects of the six-dimensional
physics, since the general philosophy of the brane construction for six dimensional theories was
already presented in [14].
