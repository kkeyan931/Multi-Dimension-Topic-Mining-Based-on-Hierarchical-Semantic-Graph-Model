couplings between a closed string rr eld and open strings are calculated in a
system of coincident branes and antibranes of type ii theory. the result can be
written cleanly using the curvature of the superconnection.

1 introduction

unstable d-brane systems can decay and produce branes of lower dimension. the most simple decay
is that of a dp-brane annihilating with a dp-antibrane to yield a d(p  2)-brane. in this scenario the
lightest open-string mode stretching between the brane-antibrane pair is tachyonic and it can condense
into a conguration with non-trivial winding. then, in order to have nite energy, the gauge eld living
on the branes must have non-zero rst chern class which implies the existence of a non-zero (p  2)-brane
charge. the happy state of aairs is that the negative energy density of the condensed tachyon eld
exactly cancels with the positive energy density of the brane-antibrane pair asymptotically, leaving a
d(p  2)-brane with nite tension [1].

one can also start with non-supersymmetric dp-branes in type ii theory (p is odd for iia and
even for iib). here too there is a tachyon in the spectrum of the open string connecting the brane to
itself.
it can condense into a kink and the unstable non-supersymmetric brane will decay to yield a
stable d(p  1) brane. this type of brane production was studied in detail in [2] where it was argued
that all supersymmetric d-branes in iia can be constructed as bound states of a number of d9-branes.
further examples of such decay processes are studied in [28] and can be understood within the context
of k-theory [9, 10]. the unstable and non-bps branes have also been used in testing various duality
conjectures [1, 8, 11, 12], indeed it was in this context that they made their rst major appearance.

the congurations that are studied in this note are a straightforward generalisation of the scenario
described in the rst paragraph to n dp-branes coincident with n dp-antibranes. without the antibranes
the coupling of the u(n ) massless world-volume vectors (denoted by a) to the closed-string rr elds
(denoted by c) is given by the wess-zumino action [13, 14]

s = z(p+1)

c  tr ef ,

(1)

where (p+1) is the world volume, tr is over the chan-paton factors and f is the eld strength for a.
numerical factors such as  have been suppressed, as have the contributions from the antisymmetric
2-form and the a-roof genus [1517]. when the antibranes are included, the light degrees of freedom are
two u(n ) gauge elds  one living on the branes (a+) and the other on the antibranes (a)  and a
tachyon (t ) and antitachyon ( t ) living in the (n, n ) and ( n , n ) representations respectively. we would
like to know the generalisation of the wess-zumino action. to this end we perform a tree-level string
calculation of the eective action to low orders in the tachyon eld.

we nd a non-zero contact interaction of the form

z(p+1)

c(p1)  d tr (cid:16)t  dt(cid:17) ,

(2)

where the covariant derivatives are

dt = dt + a+t  t a and dt = d t  t a+ + a t .

1

in this note we will not calculate the overall normalisation of such terms (except to say their coecients
are not zero) since they are unimportant for our purposes. we also consider the brane-antibrane pairs to
have indistinguishable world volumes.1 the result eq. (2) means the total charge of the (p  2)-brane is

measured by r tr (cid:16)f +  f  + d(t dt )(cid:17) which contains the rst chern class of the gauge conguration

on the brane, the antibrane, and the winding number of the tachyon conguration, however, this latter
term does not add unwanted charge to the (p  2)-brane because the covariant derivative, dt , must
vanish at innity in order for the solitonic conguration to have nite energy.

the coupling to the rr (p  1)-form given by eqs. (1) and (2) can be rewritten to read

z(p+1)

c(p1)  tr (cid:16)f +  f   1

2 (cid:8)f +, t t(cid:9) + 1

2 (cid:8)f , t t(cid:9) + dt  dt(cid:17) ,

(3)

interestingly, this can be written in a more compact form by employing the superconnection of noncom-
mutative geometry [1921]

which transforms under the u(n )u(n ) symmetry as

a =   d + a+

t

t

d + a ! ,

the curvature of this is

and a supertrace is dened by

a  gag1 where g =   g 0

0 g ! .

f =   f +  t t

dt

dt

f   t t ! ,

str   a b

c d ! = tr a  tr d .

then the terms in eq. (3) are just those in an expansion of

s =z(p+1)

c  str ef .

(4)

we propose that this generalises the usual wess-zumino action eq. (1).

before moving on to the string calculation, let us show that our proposal gives the correct charges

for all decay products. this can be seen by using the transgression formula [20, p. 47] which reads

1further comments on this point are made in [18] in which the tachyon potential was shown to assume a mexican hat

dt str

shape for weak elds.

2

where at is a superconnection depending on a continuous parameter t, and ft is its curvature. let us
choose

at =   d + a+

t t

tt

d + a ! .

when the transgression formula is integrated over the 2k directions perpendicular to the (p  2k)-branes
world volume we can set dt = 0 = dt on the rhs. the rhs then integrates to zero because it contains
only odd dimensional forms. this implies

z2k

str exp f = z2k

tr exp f + z2k

tr exp f  ,

as required.

2 the calculations

the process of interest is one where a rr boson annihilates onto the brane-antibrane world volume to
create some open strings. by string duality this is just an open string graph with insertions on the
boundary (the branes world volume) and one rr insertion in the interior. similar calculations have
been performed in [2227] and we will follow their notations and conventions:

map the disc to the upper-half plane so the boundary of the disc becomes the real axis. on this axis

the worldsheet bosons (x ) and fermions () obey the following boundary conditions

neumann: ( x a(z) = x a(z)

a(z) = a(z)

and dirichlet: ( x i(z) =  x i(z)

i(z) =  i(z)

,

while the ghosts (c) and superghosts () obey trivial boundary conditions. indices  = 0, . . . , 9, while
an index a lives on the world volume (a = 0, . . . , p) and i lls the transverse space (i = (p + 1), . . . , 9).
because of these boundary conditions the correlators mix;

neumann:
dirichlet:

hx a(z)x b(w)i = ab log(z  w)
hx i(z)x j (w)i = ij log(z  w)

and
and

hx a(z) x b( w)i = ab log(z  w) ,
hx i(z) x j ( w)i = +ij log(z  w) .

(5)
and similarly for the fermions (we use the conventions  = 2). now use the doubling trick in which
the elds x(z) and (z) are extended to the lower-half plane by dening

x(z) = ( x(z)

 x(z)

neumann
dirichlet

(z  lhp) .

then if we think of w being in the lhp the correlation function of this extended holomorphic eld

hx (z)x  (w)i =  log(z  w) ,

3

correctly reproduces all of eq. (5). thus, when considering scattering o p-branes, the rule is to replace

x (z)  d

 x (z) ,

(z)  d

 (z) ,

(z)  (z) and c(z)  c(z) ,

where

and then use the usual correlators

d =   1p+1

0

0

19p ! ,

hx (z)x  (w)i =  log(z  w) ,
h(z) (w)i =  (z  w)1 ,

hc(z)c(w)i = (z  w) ,

h(z)(w)i =  log(z  w) .

the vertex operators for the tachyon are

v (0)
t (x) = keikx (x) and v (1)

t

(x) = eeikx(x) ,

where the superscripts label the superghost number. the momentum k is constrained to lie in the world
volume; k = (ka, 0) with k2 = 1/4 in our conventions ( = 2). in the coincident brane-antibrane system
the vertex operators for the tachyon and the antitachyon look the same  in order to distinguish them
a chan-paton factor must be understood. after doubling, the vertex operators become [28]

v (0)
t (z) = ke2ikx(z) ,
v (1)
(z) = ee2ikx (z) .
t

the rr vertex operators are

rr (w, w) = (ph/ (m)) : e/2seipx (w) : : e /2 seip x ( w) :
v (1)

with the projector p = 1

2 (1  11) assuring that we are using the correct chirality and

h/ (m) =

1
m!

h1...m1 . . . m ,

where m = 2, 4 for type iia and m = 1, 3, 5 for type iib. the spinorial indices are raised with the charge
conjugation matrix, eg (ph/ (m)) = c (ph/ (m))
 (further conventions and notations for spinors
can be found in appendix b of [23]). the rr bosons are massless so p2 = 0. the spin elds can also be
extended to the entire complex plane. in calculations we replace

where

s( w)  m

s( w) ,

m =

1
p!

a0a1 . . . apa0...ap .

4

finally, a couple of correlators containing two spin elds are

hs(w)si = w5/4c 1
 ,

h(z)s(w)si = (z  w)1/2z1/2w3/4

 .

where s = s(0) and c is the charge conjugation matrix.

2.1 the two-point amplitude

the amplitude containing one rr eld and one tachyon (or antitachyon) is

at,rr = z dzdwd w
= z dzdwd w

vckg

vckg

hv (1)

rr (w, w)i ,

he(z)e2ikx(z)e(w)/2s(w)eipx(w)(ph/ (m)m )

e( w)/2s( w)eipdx( w)i .

we have chosen the vertex operators according to the rule that the total superghost number must be 2.
including the ghost contribution, hc(z)c(w)c( w)i = (z  w)(z  w)(w  w), and using the kinematic
constraint, ka + pa = 0, the volume of the conformal killing group can be canceled by xing the three
insertion points. the amplitude then reads

repeated use of {,  } = 2 yields

at,rr = tr (cid:16)ph/ (m)m(cid:17) .

tr (cid:16)[1 . . . m][a0 . . . ap](cid:17) = 32(p + 1)!m,p+1[m

[a0

m1
a1

. . . 1]
ap] ,

implying that the amplitude vanishes since there is no h(p+1) in the type ii string. on the other hand,
in the case of a non-bps brane (as studied recently in [29]) this amplitude implies the eective action

contains the term r c  dt .

2.2 the three-point amplitude

the three-point amplitude between one rr eld, and two tachyonic particles is

at,t,rr = z dzdzdwd w
= z dzdzdwd w

vckg

vckg

hv (0)

t (z)v (1)

hk(z)e2ikx(z)e(z)e2ikx(z)e(w)/2s(w)eipx(w)(ph/ (m)m )

e( w)/2s( w)eipdx( w)i .

5

it is convenient to x the points (z, z, w, w) = (x, x, i, i) to cancel the volume vckg by inserting the
ghost contribution

hc(z)c(w)c( w)i = (z  w)(z  w)(w  w) .

introduce the mandelstam variable t = (k + k)2. then using various kinematic constraints such as

ka + ka + pa = 0 and pdp = 2t = 2p(k + k) ,

the amplitude reduces to

at,t,rr = z 



dx  (1 + x2)2

(6)

next the trace must be evaluated;

tr (1 . . . ma0 . . . apa) h1...ma0...ap = 32(p + 1)!m,p(1)p(p+1)/2ha0...ap1a1...ap1a .

the trace containing the factor of 11 ensures the following results also hold for p > 3 with h(m) 
h(10m) for m  5.

the prefactor of eq. (6) has the interesting property that at non-negative integer values of t there is
a pole corresponding to an open-string resonance with mass-squared m2 = t = p2
a. on the other hand,
at positive half-integer values of t it vanishes, implying that strings with half-integer mass-squared do
not propagate in this channel. in [24] it was shown that these are also properties of the amplitude for
one ns-ns string to decay into two massless open strings stuck to a d-brane.

the low-energy eective lagrangian of massless and tachyonic particles will contain the terms

le  h(p)  a + lym + dt dt ,

(7)

as well as the terms we are looking for. here lym is the yang-mills lagrangian and in keeping with
the spirit of the rest of this note all constants have been omitted. at low energies (t = p2
a  0) the
prefactor of eq. (6) may be expanded



[2t]
[ 1
2  t]2

=

1
2t

+ 2 log 2 + o(t) .

the rst term corresponds to the rr particle decaying into a massless open string (via the rst term
in eq. (7)) which propagates (resulting in the pole) and decays into two tachyons (via the third term in
eq. (7)). because the second term is non-zero, the eective action contains a coupling between the rr
eld, the tachyon and the antitachyon.

6

in summary, in this subsection we have shown that the eective action contains the term

se = z(p+1)

h(p)  tr t dt .

which is eq. (2) after integrating by parts and covariantising. as an aside, if there is no antitachyon (in
the case of the non-supersymmetric brane) the integration by parts gives zero.

3 summary

in coincident brane-antibrane systems we have shown, by calculating tree-level string amplitudes, that
in addition to the usual wess-zumino terms the world-volume eective action contains

z(p+1)

c(p1)  d tr (t dt ) ,

to o(t t ). after tachyon condensation the correct charges for decay products are obtained. we pro-
pose that the full result (to all orders in the tachyon) can be written in terms of the curvature of the
superconnection:

z(p+1)

c  str exp f .
