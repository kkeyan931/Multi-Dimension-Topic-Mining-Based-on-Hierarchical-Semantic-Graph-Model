abstract

the spectrum of massless bosonic and fermionic uids satisfying the equation of
state p = (1) is derived using elementary statistical methods. as a limiting case,
the lorentz invariant spectrum of the vacuum ( = 0, p = ) is deduced. these
results are in agreement with our earlier derivation for bosons using thermodynamics
and semiclassical considerations.

1. introduction

the class of -uids is the simplest kind of relativistic perfect simple uids

used in the framework of general relativity and cosmology. such a class is usually

dened in terms of so-called -law equation of state

p = (  1) ,

(1)

where   [0, 2]. some special types of media described by the the above relation

are: (i) vacuum (p = ,  = 0) (ii) a randomly oriented distribution of innitely
thin, straight strings averaged over all directions (p =  1
3,  = 2/3), (iii) blackbody
radiation (p = 1
3,  = 4/3), and (iv) sti matter (p = ,  = 2). in a series of recent
papers (lima and santos, 1995; lima and maia, 1995a,b), some general properties of

this monoparametric family of uids have been discussed based on thermodynamic

and semiclassical considerations. in particular, we have stressed the unusual ther-

modynamic behavior arising when the  parameter is smaller than one. in this case,

unlike of the subset with positive pressure, the temperature increases in the course

of an adiabatic expansion. in the vacuum case, for instance, it was shown that the

temperature scales as t  v , where v is the volume. further, by assuming that

such uids may be regarded as a kind of generalized radiation, the general planck

form of the spectrum have been obtained, which includes the vacuum spectrum as

a particular case (lima and maia, 1995b).

in our opinion, the special attention

given to this class of uids has a very simple physical motivation. physicists have

no intuitive picture of the relativistic quantum vacuum, which remains one the most

unknown physical systems. a possible way to overcome such a diculty is using a

-uid. in principle, by establishing the physical properties for a generic value of

, one can obtain the lorentz-invariant vacuum properties taking the limit  = 0.

such a possibility, may be important even in the cosmological domain, where the

vacuum physics is closely related to the cosmological constant problem (weinberg,

1989). in this connection, it should be recalled that in some stages, the scalar elds

driving ination can also be thought of as a kind of -uid, regardless of the details

of its potential. this happens, for instance, during the coherent eld oscillations

phase of the inaton eld at the end of ination (kolb and turner, 1990).

in this context, it seems interesting to extend the classical thermodynamic ap-

proach developed in the above papers, making the necessary connection with the

microphysics underlying such systems. in the present article, our main goal is to

show how the planckian-type distribution for a -uid, which has been discussed

1

in the framework of the old quantum theory of radiation, can be reproduced in the

domain of statistical mechanics. this allow us to extend the theory for fermions

as well. of course, the third and last step would be to derive the spectrum from a

more basic theory as quantum eld theory.

2. the spectrum of -fluids

now consider the canonical procedure to compute the pressure p and the

energy density  in elementary statistical mechanics. as usually, these quantities

are dened by

and

v !t
p = kt  nq

 =

kt 2

v  nq
t !v

(2)

(3)

where nq is the grand-canonical thermodynamic potential, which corresponds to

a quantum uid in contact with a thermal reservoir at temperature t. since we are

assuming that the vacuum state behaves like a kind of radiation, which diers from

blackbody radiation only due to the equation of state, we take the chemical potential

of any -uid to be identically zero.

in this case, by considering a continuous

spectrum, we have the well known formula (itzykson and zuber, 1980)

nq = v z 

0

n 1  exp(

h
kt

)! f ()d

(4)

where the upper and lower sign inside the brackets correponds to bosons and fermions

respectively.

our aim now is to nd the unknown function f (), which is the number of states

per unit energy.

from equations (1)-(4) we get easily

 kt z 

0

n 1  exp(

h
kt

)! f ()d = (  1)hz 

0

f ()

exp( h

kt )  1

d.

(5)

of course, the above equation points to a singularity at  = 1. this rather

pathological case (dust), describing a zero-pressure uid, will not be considered

here. a partial integration on the left-hand side of (5) furnishes

 kt n 1  exp(

h
kt

)! f ()(cid:21)

0

+ hz 

0

f ()
kt )  1

exp( h

d,

(6)

2

where f () is a primitive of f ()

f () = f ().

(7)

let us now suppose, for a moment, that the rst term in (6), which corresponds

to a boundary term, vanishes. in what follows, it will become clear under which

conditions the function f () will fulll such a constraint. bearing this in mind, we

may write from (5) and (6)

z 

0

f ()
kt )  1

exp( h

d = (  1)z 

0

f ()

exp( h

kt )  1

d.

(8)

the correctness of the above equation will be guaranteed if the functions f ()

and f () obeying (7) satisfy the following relation

f () = (  1)f ().

(9)

in principle, we cannot guarantee that equation (9) will furnish all physically mean-

ingful solutions of equations (7) and (8). our condence that it is the physical

solution is supported by our equivalent earlier result using only thermodynamics

and semiclassical considerations (lima and maia, 1995b). in addition, it is easy to

see that equation (9) is independent of the statistics of the -uids particles.

from equations (7) and (9) one obtains the dierential equation for f ()

f ()
f ()

= (

2  
  1

)

1


,

(10)

where the prime denotes derivation with respect to w. the solution of above equa-

tion is straightforward,

f () = a(2)/(1)

,

(11)

where a is a -dependent integration constant. now, inserting the above equation

into (4) and using (3) we obtain

(t ) = z 

0

1

1

a
exp( h

kt )  1

d.

therefore, the spectrum of a -uid reads:

(, t ) =

1

1

a
exp( h

kt )  1

.

(13)

for the case of bosons, equations (12) and (13) above are exactly equations (39)

and (53) presented by lima and maia(1995b). as expected, by introducing a new
variable x = h
kt , one obtains from (12), the generalized stefanboltzmann law (lima
and santos, 1995)

(t ) = t



1 ,

(14)

where the constant  depends on the -parameter as well as on the bosonic (or

fermionic) spin degrees of freedom of each eld. note also that the above expression

for (t ) does not means that the energy density is always nite for any value of

.

in particular, for the vacuum case ( = 0),  eectively does not depend on

the temperature, but the constant  is innite, as it should be from quantum eld

theory.

3. the vacuum-infrared divergence

naturally, the validity of equations (12)-(14), is crucially dependent on our

earlier hypotheses concerning the boundary term in equation (6). in order to clarify

this point we will compute explicitly such a term. from (9) and (11) it follows that

f () = a(  1)

1

1

.

(15)

now, inserting the function f () into (6), we see that for  ranging on the interval

1 <   2, the boundary term vanishes in accordance with our earlier conjecture.

in particular, this means that the above derivation works well in the case of photons

( = 4/3). however, we nd a divergence in the limit   0, when 0   < 1. in

the vacuum case, for instance, equation (13) reduces to

vac(, t ) =

ah1

exp( h

kt )  1

.

(16)

thus, even though that the vacuum energy density does not depends on the tem-

perature [see (15)], it also exhibts the same kind of divergence. thus the spectrum

for negative pressures 0   < 1, demands closer attention due to the inevitable

existence of an infrared divergence.

to avoid the infrared catastrophe we proceed in analogy with the casimir ef-

fect, in which the divergent energy density has been regularized by an ultraviolet
exponential cut-o e, with  > 0 (plunien et al., 1986; ruggiero and zimmer-
man, 1977). in this way, we use an infrared exponential cut-o e 
 ,  > 0. by

4

introducing the regularized function

f() = f ()e 



,

(17)

it is straighforward to check that f() makes the boundary term in (6) vanishes.

now, returning to equation (7), we may dene its regularized counterpart

f() = f 

()

(18)

and from (15), (17) and (18) is readily obtained the regularized density of states

function

f() = a(1 +

(  1)



)(2)/(1) exp(




)

,

(19)

which, as should be expected, reduces to f () in the limit   0. from (5) and (6)

the regularized equation of state reads

where

and

p = (  1)

,

p = z 

0

f()

exp( h

kt )  1

d

 = z 

0

f()

exp( h

kt )  1

d.

(20)

(21)

(22)

it should be noticed taht the above regularized integrals are nite to all cases

0    2,  6= 1. however, if   0, we obtain the original infrared divergence for

0   < 1. in particular, this means that the method outlined in section 2 is valid

either with no regularization or renormalization only for positive pressures. as a

matter of fact, although the regularized quantities p and  are nite, they are cut-
o dependent. to eliminate this dependence, a renormalization scheme is required.

in this connection it seems interesting to investigate the second quantization of -

uids and search for a renormalization scheme in this theory. this issue is presently

under investigation.
