abstract

we consider a two dimensional su(n ) gauge theory coupled to an adjoint ma-
jorana fermion, which is known to be supersymmetric for a particular value of
fermion mass. we investigate the soft supersymmetry breaking of the discrete
light cone quantization (dlcq) formulation this theory. there are several dlcq
of formulation of this theory currently in the literature and they naively appear to
behave dierently under soft supersymmetry breaking. a detail study shows that
the theory admits another operator related to the zero modes of the theory. this
new operator is irrelevant at the supersymmetric value of the mass and appears
to be marginal at other masses. all the previous results for this theory can be
obtained from this new theory and the soft breaking of the supersymmetry of all
the versions of this theory are shown to be consistent.

1 introduction

over the last several years we have learned a great deal about supersymmetric gauge

theories following the discovery of dualities between string/m-theory and supersymmet-

ric gauge theories [1, 2, 3]. recently this has been extended to conformal eld theories

without supersymmtery [4]. evidently, it would be desirable to have a deeper under-

standing of supersymmetry breaking in order to bridge the gap between the formulation

of physics in a supersymmetric world, and its more realistic counterpart, where no such

symmetry is manifest. one straightforward approach is to start with a supersymmetric

formulation, and then proceed to break supersymmetry softly by adding appropriate

mass terms.

the context within which we will consider this is a theory that has been well studied

before: two dimensional su(n) gauge theory coupled to an adjoint majorana fermion

[5]. interestingly, this theory is known to exhibit supersymmetry at a particular value of
the fermion mass, m = msu sy [7]. this is believed to be a theory with two parameters
g and m, both of which have the dimensions of mass. since the only g dependence is an
overall g2 factor in the hamiltonian the theory depends on one dimensionless parameter
x = m2
 , should be determined
in terms of the one parameter x. in this work, we provide evidence that such a strategy

g2n and therefore all the bound state masses, in units of g2n

may yield some surprises if approached non-perturbatively.

in particular, we show that softly breaking supersymmetry may yield a manifold of

theories parameterized by the coupling of an operator, that arise from the zero modes of

the theory [6], that is irrelevant at the supersymmetric point and appears to be marginal

everywhere. by diagonalizing the dlcq hamiltonian matrix, and extrapolating to the

continuum limit, we are able to solve for bound state masses and wave functions at dier-

ent values of the fermion mass parameter x and coupling constant y of the new operator.
on the line m = msu sy (x = 1) the continuum theory exhibits a supersymmetric spec-
trum for any choice of coupling y . the operator is therefore irrelevant there. we nd,

however, that for any other value of the fermion mass parameter, dierent values of the

coupling y will yield dierent results, and so the operator is no longer irrelevant for
m 6= msu sy . we provide numerical evidence to support these claims. finally we show
non-peturbatively that if y is a particular function of x then the theory is well dened

in terms of one dimensionless parameter even away from the supersymmetric mass.

we remark here that the non-uniqueness of the dlcq formulation ([9, 10]) was

2

highlighted in the work [11], where it was shown that a dlcq prescription exists for

supersymmetric theories that preserves supersymmetry even in the discretized theory.

the advantages of such an approach are manifest, and have been exploited in a study

of a wide class of supersymmetric gauge theories in two [12, 13, 14, 15, 6] and three

dimensions [16].

2 formulations of the theories

in this section we will consider the formulations of 1 + 1 dimensional qcd coupled to

adjoint majorana fermions having arbitrary mass (see for example [5]). in the light cone
gauge a+ = 0. after eliminating non-physical degrees of freedom by solving constraint
equations, the lightcone components of total momentum are found to be:

p + = z dxt r(i),
p  = z dxt r

ij = 2ikkj is the longitudinal component of the fermion
current. to avoid introducing an additional mass scale in the theory we will write this
in term of mass operators: m 2 = 2p +p . it is well known that at the special value of
fermionic mass (namely m2
su sy = g2n/) this system is supersymmetric [7]. we will use
a dimensionless mass parameter x = m2
g2n , and the supersymmetric point is x = 1 and
the masses of all bound states will be quoted in units of g2n/.the supercharge is given

it can be checked that at m = msu sy the susy algebra {q, q} = 22p  is satised.
in the dlcq approximation the system lives in a x box of length l and one would have
sums over discrete variables k+ 6= 0 instead of integrations in the above formulas. for
periodic boundary conditions (bc), k+ = n/l where n = 1, 2, . . . , k and k is called
the resolution. for anti-periodic bc k+ = (n  1/2)/l where n = 1, 2, ...k . the
continuum theory is obtained by allowing the resolution k go to innity. the states of
the theory at resolution k have total longitudinal momenum p + = k/l for periodic
bc and p + = (k/2)/l for anti-periodic bc and each fermion carries a fraction of the
total longitudinal momentum xi = k+
in the large n limit the states are made
from a single trace of a number of fermion creation operators whose total longitudinal
momentum is p +. for anti-periodic bc there are no zero modes in the theory and for
periodic bc we omit them.

i /p +.

one formulation of dlcq which we will denote as the principal value (pv) prescrip-

tion [8], treats the singularities of the hamiltonian using a pv prescription and can be

formulated using either anti- periodic or periodic bc. the anti-periodic boundary condi-

tion must break the supersymmetry at nite resolution because the fermions and bosons

are in dierent fock sectors. the pv prescription with periodic bc could in principle

give supersymmetric results at nite resolution, although this is not the case. in the pv

prescription the supersymmetry at x = 1 is restored only in the decompactication limit
(k  ). this restoration was shown in [5] 1. the hamiltonian for this formulation
will be referred to as p 

p v .

the prescription that preserves supersymmetry at nite resolution will be called

sdlcq. in sdlcq one simply uses dlcq to calculate the supercharges and then uses

the super charges to calculate the hamiltonian and longitudinal momentum operator
[11]. here we must use periodic bc because the supercharge q is cubic in the elds,
while the supercharge q+ is quadratic.

1they nd that convergence is slower for period bc

4

the susy algebra is reproduced at a special value of fermion mass and at every

nite resolution the supercharge matrices give a representation of the super algebra.
both sdlcq and p 
p v at x = 1 give the same results as the resolution goes to innity
[13] 2. we now want to add identical soft susy breaking terms (mass terms) to these
theories and study the resulting non-supersymmetric theory. since we already have a
mass term in p 
p v this only requires varying x, but for sdlcq this means explicitly
adding a mass term.

it is very instructive to actually do the numerical calculation dierently and introduce
a third formulation, psu sy which includes both sdlcq and p 
p v . we have found the
irrelevant operator which is the dierence between the sdlcq and the pv formulation
[6] 3. thus if we add this operator to the pv hamiltonian it is now supersymmetric at
every resolution and produces exactly the same mass and wave functions as sdlcq. in

the large n approximation the operator take the form.

as we expected this operator is an irrelevant operator since it was constructed to
give a vanishing result at innite resolution. in our numerical formulation of p 
su sy we
included this operator with an adjustable coupling y . we can now think of p 
su sy as
a single theory in the couple constant space (x, y ). the formulation we called pv is

y = 0 and any x and the theory we call sdlcq is x = 1 and y = 1. in the following

we will present results for the lowest mass bosons bound states as a function of x and

y. we have extrapolated to innite resolution for (x, y ) = (0, 0); (0, 1); (1, 0); (1, 1) and

we have looked at this theory as a function of x or y at nite resolutions.

3 soft susy breaking

our investigation of this theory indicates that at x = 1 ( the supersymmetric point )
the lowest mass fermion and boson bound states are degenerate with m 2 = 26 [5, 13].
using p 

su sy we nd that at x = 1 this appears to be true for any value of y.

boorstein and kutasov [17] investigate soft supersymmetry breaking for small values

2however sdlcq converges much faster
3to date we have only found this operator for this particularly simple theory but it should be possible
to nd it for other theories as well. the calculation of this operator involves a careful study of the
intermediate zero modes that contribute to the square of the supercharge

of this dierence, x  1 and they found that the degeneracy between the fermion and
boson bound state masses is broken according to

b(x) = (1  x)mb(1) + o((x  1)3).

(7)

they calculated these masses using the pv prescription (y = 0) with anti-periodic bc

and found very good agreement with the theoretical prediction. we have compared this

theoretical prediction at y = 1 and we nd that eq (7) is very well satised. at resolution
5, for example, the slope is 4.76 and the predicted slope mb(1) is 4.76. the indication
is that this result is true for any value of y.

at x = 0 and y = 1 the lowest boson mass eigenvalue squared is about 17 compared

with the values 11 for x = 0 and y = 0. since the lowest mass boson state is primarily

a two particle state it is sensible to truncate the fock basis to two particle states and

go to a very high resolution. we were able to study resolutions up to 50 and we nd

very small variation in these eigenvalues. these wavefunctions are shown in fig. 1. the

wavefunction for y = 0 with a mass squared of 11 is peaked close to x = 1 and vanish

very quickly, if at all, at x = 1. near x = 1 the shape resembles the wavefunction of the

thooft pion [8, 18]. the wavefunction with y = 1 dips at x = 1 and appears to vanish

there reminiscent of the wavefunction found by kutasov [7] for the high mass states.

both wave function are anti-symmetric because of fermi statistic and we only show the

6

range 1.0 to 0.5. the large mass dierence between the two states and the very dierent

structure of the wavefunctions make it is clear that these two states are dierent.

in fig. 2a we plot the mass squared of the lowest bound state as a function of x

and y at a resolution of k = 10 and in fig. 2b we show the associated contour plot.

these contours are lines of constant mass squared. from our previous studies we know

that as we increase the resolution the surface will become at at x = 1 so that the line

x = 1 is a contour of constant mass. this is a graphical statement of the fact that

the operator in eq 6 is an irrelevant operator at the supersymmetric point. our high

resolution study indicates that the surface does not change signicantly at x = 0 as we

increase the resolution.

selecting a particular value of the mass of the rst bound state then xes a particular
contour in fig. 2b as the physical contour and gives, y = yp(x). if this is a sensible
theory then this contour should give a constant value for the mass of all the higher mass

bound states of the theory. in fig. 2c we have plotted the mass squared of the next

higher mass bound state as a function of x and y and in fig. 2d we show the associated

contour plot. we see that the contour line in fig. 2d are essentially the same as those

in fig. 2c. we have looked at the next 20 mass plots and they all have this same form.
thus the function y = yp(x), determined from the mass of the lowest bound states,
xes the mass of all the bound states.

4 discussion

the two dimensional gauge theory of adjoint majorana fermions has been studied exten-
sively [5, 7, 13, 17] and is know to be a theory with, an overall mass scale g2, and one real
coupling the mass of the fermion, in our notation x. we studied this theory numerically

in dlcq as a function of the couplings x and y in the range 0 to 1 and the resolution
k. the four points (x, y ) = (0, 0); (0, 1); (1, 0); (1, 1) were investigated in the k  
limit. the point (1, 0) was also studied in [5] and found to converge very slow. the

remaining three points all converge much more rapidly. we expect that as the resolution

is increased the point (1,0) will increase and become equal to the point (1,1) and the

contour lines shown in figs. 1b and 1d will approach the line x = 1 as x approaches

one. the (x, y ) dependence was studied at xed resolutions up to a resolution of 10

with periodic boundary conditions. this is numerically equivalent to about a resolution

of 20 with anti-period boundray conditions.

as in any quantum eld theory the parameters are xed by measuring a few quantities

and then all remaining physical quantities are determined. what is interesting and

somewhat surprising in the dlcq formulation of the theory is the appearance of another

operator and coupling constant y . this operator arrises from a careful study of the

role of zero modes in the theory [6] and is irrelevant at the supersymmetric point and

apparrently marginal everywhere else. the theory remains nevertheless a theory with

one parameters because y can be given in terms of x. this functional relation is seen

as a set of universal contours in the plots of the mass of the bound states as a function

of x and y . it is well know that this type of behavior may occur in a quantum eld

theory [19], but it is nevertheless interesting to observe it directly in a non-perturbative

8

context.

it appears that soft supersymmetry breaking of the gauge theory of adjoint majo-

rana fermions leads to a well dened theory and in dlcq one obtains the best numerical

convergence by starting from the sdlcq formulation that is supersymmetric at every

resolution. it remains an open question whether this proceedure could provide a sensible

approach to soft supersymmetry breaking in higher dimensions.
