abstract

a new method is discussed which vastly simplies one of the two integrals over adsd+1
required to compute exchange graphs for 4point functions of scalars in the ads/cft cor-
respondence. the explicit form of the bulktobulk propagator is not required. previous
results for scalar, gauge boson and graviton exchange are reproduced, and new results are
given for massive vectors. it is found that precisely for the cases that occur in the ads5 s5
compactication of type iib supergravity, the exchange diagrams reduce to a nite sum of
graphs with quartic scalar vertices. the analogous integrals in npoint scalar diagrams for
n > 4 are also evaluated.

1 introduction

during the past year several groups have calculated 4point correlation functions in ads super-
gravity as part of the study of the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3]. in particular the position
space correlators for quartic scalar interactions [4, 5] , gauge boson exchange [6], scalar eld
exchange [7, 8], and graviton exchange [9] have been obtained. there is additional work on a
momentum space approach [10].

exchange diagrams, see figure 1, contain a bulktobulk propagator, and two integrations
over adsd+1 are required to compute the amplitude. in past work the rst integral, called the z
integral, was calculated by a cumbersome expansion and resummation procedure which typically
gave a simple function of the other bulk coordinate w as result. this suggests that a more
direct method should be possible, and it is the main purpose of the present paper to present one.
specically we show that zintegrals satisfy a simple differential equation which can be solved
recursively. the specic form of the bulktobulk propagator is not required. all previous cases
can be handled quite easily by the new method, and we are also able to obtain new results for
massive vector exchange amplitudes as well as for higher point correlators. the new method
does not simplify the remaining integral over the w coordinate, and we refer to past work
[6, 8, 9] in which useful integral representations and asymptotic formulas for these wintegrals
have been derived.

our main focus of interest is the ads5  s5 compactication of iib supergravity [11], but
clearly the method we propose, and most of our formulas, have a general validity. we do not
discuss certain subtleties that occur in d = 2 for massless vector and graviton equations, which
would require a more careful investigation of asymptotics and are left to future work (hopefully
by someone else).

in all the exchange graphs that we study, it is found that precisely for the trilinear couplings
that occur in the ads5  s5 supergravity, the exchange diagram reduces to a nite sum of scalar
quartic graphs. generic couplings give instead an innite sum. we lack a fundamental expla-
nation of this fact, although we suspect some simple mathematical reason related to harmonic
analysis on s5 and representation theory of the conformal group so(5, 1). it would be interest-
ing to check whether the same holds for other supergravity compactications of interest in the
ads/cft correspondence (for example [12]).

the basic idea is presented in section 2 for scalar exchange. massless and massive vector
exchange is discussed in section 3, and graviton exchange in section 4. in section 5 we discuss
an application to npoint correlators for n  5.

as in most past work, we calculate on the euclidean continuation of adsd+1, which is modelled
as the upper half space z  rd+1, with z0 > 0, and metric g of constant negative curvature

it is well-known that adsinvariant functions, such as scalar propagators, are simply expressed
[13] as functions of the chordal distance u, dened by

u =

(z  w)2 = (z  w)(z  w)

(2.3)

a scalar eld of mass m2 is characterized by two possible scale dimensions, namely the roots

(2.4)

of the quadratic relation m2 = (  d). the mass must satisfy the bound [14] m2  d2/4.
for m2  d2/4 + 1, one must choose the largest root  = +.
in the range d2/4 <
m2 < d2/4 + 1, the bulk eld may be quantized with either dimension , and it is known
that supersymmetry can require both choices to occur in the same theory. only the largest root
appears in most applications of the ads/cft correspondence, but we will need to discuss the
other possibility briey. unless explicitly indicated  will mean +.

2. more general integrals with deriva-
all scaling dimensions will be always understood to be  d
tive couplings can be reduced to this case (see for example (a.5) in [9]). in this paper we develop
a new method to calculate the zintegrals (2.11). the remaining wintegral (2.10) can then be
handled by the asymptotic expansion techniques developed in [6, 8, 9].

as in past work, the integral (2.11) is considerably simplied by performing the translation

convergence of the integral requires  > |1  3|, and we assume that this condition, and the
2 hold in the following. integrals of this form with scalar, vector,
previous conditions , i  d
and symmetric tensor bulktobulk propagators are the main focus of this paper.

let us rst discuss briey the old method for evaluating the integral and then the new one.

in the old method a quadratic transformation of the hypergeometric function, namely

g(u) = 2 cf (

was used. the propagator was then expressed as a power series in  and the zintegral was
done term by term using feynman parameters. the resulting series, usually a geometric series,
was then resummed. for favorable relations among the dimensions , 1, 3, and d, relations
which cover all the cases in the application of the ads/cft correspondence to the d = 4, n = 4
superymmetric yangmills theory, the feynman parameter integral could also be done and the
result for i(w) was a simple polynomial in the variable w2

0/w2.

the new method is ultrasimple for scalar exchange. we rst note that invariance of i(w)
under the scale transformation w  w and under the ddimensional poincare subgroup of
so(d + 1, 1) implies that i(w) can be represented as

where

i(w) = (w0)13f (t)

t =

w2 =

(2.17)

(2.18)

and 13  1  3. next we apply the wave operator (2 + m2) to i(w) and use (2.7) to
obtain

(2 + m2)[(w0)13f (t)] = (w0)13t3 .

(2.19)

the next step is to work out the action of the laplacian on the left side, which leads to the
inhomogeneous second order differential equation for f (t)

4t2(t  1)f  + 4t[(13 + 1)t  13 +

d
2  1]f  + [13(d  13) + m2]f = t3

(2.20)

the particular solution that corresponds to the actual value of the integral (2.14) is selected by
the following asymptotic conditions on f (t):

1. since i(w) is perfectly regular at ~w = 0, f (t) must be smooth as t  1.
2. in the limit w0  0 we have from (2.5) and (2.3) that i(w)  w
as t  0. (recall that we are considering the case  = +).

0 , which implies f (t) 

the differential operator in (2.20) is closely related to the hypergeometric operator, and we
will discuss this shortly, but for the cases of interest we can nd a particular solution of the
equation more quickly if we convert it to a recursion relation. to do this we assume the series
representation

f (t) = xk

aktk .

(2.21)

upon substitution in (2.20) we nd a recursion relation for the coefcients which works down-
wards in k. we can consistently set ak = 0 for k  3. we then get

ak = 0

note that k need not take integer values, rather k = 3+l with l integer but 3 arbitrary. we now
observe that the series terminates at the positive value1 kmin = (  13)/2  kmax = 3  1
provided that 1 + 3   is a positive even integer. if (and only if) this condition is satis-
ed, (2.212.24) give a welldened particular solution of (2.20) with the required asymptotic
properties. we will shortly prove its uniqueness.

1 one may also consider solutions which terminate because the second factor in the numerator of (2.24) vanishes,
which gives a lower value of kmin. we have not studied this possibility since it does not satisfy the required behavior
as w0  0.

5

it is pleasant to observe that the condition for terminating series is satised for all the cases
that occur in type iib ads5 s5 supergravity [11] due to restrictions on trilinear couplings from
su(4) symmetry [16, 8]2. in this paper we will only consider the terminating case.

we can easily prove uniqueness of the solution (2.212.24) by showing that any combination
of the two homogeneous solutions of (2.20) fails to satisfy the asymptotic requirements on f (t).
by making the change of variable x = 1/t, we can write the homogeneous equation as

x(1 x)f (x) + [1 13 (1 13 +
which is the hypergeometric equation of parameters a = 13
two independent homogeneous solutions of (2.20) are then given by [17]

it is easy to see that f1 is singular for t  1, while f2 is regular in the same limit. we must
then reject f1 based on the rst asymptotic condition stated above. for t  0, f2(t)  t
,
which violates the second asymptotic condition. f2 scales at small t with the rate corresponding
to the irregular choice of boundary condition for the bulk scalar, i.e.  = . the value
of the integral (2.14) for  =  could be obtained in the terminating case by adding to the
particular solution (2.212.24) a multiple of f2.

we now make contact with the results of [8]. the restriction of 1 + 3  to positive even
integers agrees with the condition stated after (3.22) of [8] for termination of the (transformed)
hypergeometric series in (3.10) or (3.11). the integral in (3.11) then yields a polynomial ex-
pression wich precisely agrees with (2.212.24). note that the integral i(w) was called r(w) in
[8].

we can nally assemble the result for the initial amplitude (2.10). from (2.13), (2.172.18),

(2.21), inverting back to the original coordinates ~xi (see (2.12)), we have

2su (4) group theory also allows the case 1 + 3   = 0, for which our particular solution is either ill
dened or nonterminating. (in this latter case it is singular at t = 1.) however it appears that in these cases the
trilinear supergravity coupling contains derivatives, and the relevant integral can be transformed to integrals obeying
the termination condition, see the appendix of [8].

i.e. the exchange amplitude reduces to a nite sum of scalar quartic graphs. the analytic proper-
ties of these quartic graphs have been extensively studied [4, 5, 6, 8, 9]. in particular asymptotic
expansions in terms of conformally invariant variables are available. we refer the reader to sec-
tion 6 and to appendix a of [9] for a selfcontained derivation of these expansions and of many
other useful identities.

3 vector exchange

the basic procedure for vector and tensor exchange integrals is the same as in the scalar case.
we use the wave equation satised by the bulktobulk propagator to turn the integral into an
inhomogeneous second order differential equation for scalar functions of t = (w0)2/w2 and then
obtain the particular solution with required asymptotics by a recursion relation. the choice of a
suitable ansatz which expresses the vector or tensor valued integral in terms of scalar functions
and the action of the wave operator on that ansatz are more complicated than in the scalar case.

for vector exchange we study the integrals

where

v (~x1, ~x2, ~x3, ~x4) = z dd+1w
a(w, ~x1, ~x3) = z dd+1z

wd+1

zd+1
0

note that we use unprimed indices for the w coordinate and primed indices for z. the only
information we need about the bulktobulk propagator is the dening wave equation, namely

1
g



(gg[g] (w, z)) + m2g (w, z) = g (w, z) +  (u)

(3.3)

where the rst term is the maxwell operator and the second is the mass term. the pure gauge
term appears on the right side only for m2 = 0 because the operator is then noninvertible.
for m2 6= 0, this is the appropriate wave equation for the massive vector elds of type iib
supergravity on ads5  s5 [11]. we have also assumed that vectors couple to the conserved
current formed from the two bulktoboundary propagators in (3.2). this is certainly the case
for massless gauge bosons, and we restrict attention to conserved current sources for massive
kk vectors also. the method can be extended to include more general sources.

the propagator transforms as a bitensor under inversion, so the integral transforms to the

inverted frame as [15]

(3.5)

we now need a suitable ansatz for the vector function i(w). scale symmetry and d

dimensional poincare symmetry suggest the form

i(w) =

w
w2 f (t) +

0
w0

h(t)

(3.6)

however, the second term can be dropped because of the following argument. the rst step
is the observation that di(w) = 0. this follows because the divergence dg (w, z) is
a rank 1 bitensor in a maximally symmetric space, and must then be proportional to the only
independent rank 1 bitensor [19], namely  u, times a scalar function of u. dg (w, z) can
then be expressed as a zderivative of a scalar function:

dg (w, z) =  u g(u) =   (cid:18)z g(u)(cid:19) .

(3.7)

this gradient term3 can then be partially integrated in the zintegral for di(w) = 0 and
vanishes by current conservation. the divergence can now be applied to the ansatz (3.6), which
gives

0 = di(w) = d(cid:18)w

w2 f (t)(cid:19) + d  0

w0

h(t)!

(3.8)

the rst term vanishes identically, while the second term leads to a separable rst order homoge-
neous equation for h(t). the nontrivial solution is singular as t  1 and must be rejected, since
we see by inspection of (3.2) that i(w) is regular there. thus we have proven that h(t) = 0 and
we can use the representation

i(w) =

w
w2 f (t).

(3.9)

we now apply the wave operator to i(w), and use (3.3) under the integral sign (the gauge

term vanishes when integrated by parts). the result is the equation

1

(cid:18)gg[(cid:18)w]

w2 f (t)(cid:19)(cid:19) + m2 w

w2 f (t) = 21

w
w2 t1 .

(3.10)

it is now straightforward, although complicated, to calculate the result of the action of the
maxwell operator on the left side, and this leads to the differential equation

4t2(t  1)f  + 4t(2t +

d  4
2

)f  + m2f = 21 t1 .

(3.11)

3for massive vectors, the eld equation implies that the gradient term is proportional to   (w, z).

8

this inhomogeneous differential equation is clearly of the same type as (2.20) for scalar ex-
change. we thus proceed in the same way by looking for a particular solution of the form

with k  {kmin, kmin + 1, . . . , kmax}. we nd:

f (t) = xk

the series terminates at 0 < kmin = d2

condition is obeyed, (3.123.15) dene the unique particular solution of (3.11) with the correct
asymptotic properties to correspond to the actual value of the integral (3.2). for m2 = 0 and
d = 2, the coefcient akmin = a0 is innite, a signal that this case requires special attention.

4 + 1

we now consider the application of these results to the ads5  s5 compactication of iib
supergravity. from table iii in [11], we see that the allowed values of the mass for kk vectors
are m2 = (l  1)(l + 1), with l integer  1. the termination condition then requires 1  1 
(1/2+l/2) be a nonnegative integer, which restricts l to be odd and < 211. it can be shown
that su(4) selection rules [16] enforce l odd, l  21  1. in fact, the value of l correlates to
the quadrality of the su(4) representation of the vector eld, the quadrality is 0 or 2 for l odd or
even. since scalar elds come in representations with quadrality 2 or 0, and we are assuming two
equal scalar elds 1 = 3, imposing that the sum of the quadralities in the trilinear coupling
is 0 mod 4 forces l to be odd. the inequality l  2  1 is the standard clebschgordon
triangle inequality. we thus observe the nice phenomenon that precisely for the cases allowed in
the supergravity we get terminating series for the vector exchange zintegrals4.

we now wish to compare with the results of [6], where the massless vector exchange was
computed. for m = 0, the termination condition requires 1  d/2 be a nonnegative integer,
which is in particular satised for d even and 1 integer satisfying the unitarity bound. this
is the condition stated in [6] after (3.21) for the zintegral (3.20) to reduce to a nite sum of
elementary terms. comparison with the results of the present paper shows perfect agreement.

4 one possible exception to this is the marginal case l = 21  1. we would expect, in analogy to the scalar
exchange, that this case occurs in the actual supergravity theory with a different coupling. it would be nice to check
this explicitly from the supergravity lagrangian.

4 graviton exchange

the tensor exchange integral is more complicated than previous cases, although the new method
is still considerably simpler than that of previous work [9]. we start with the integral

operator and are thus not determined by the present technique. on the other hand they have no
physical effect, since they drop out of the nal dd+1w integral which contains another conserved
stress tensor.

the major task is to apply the wave operator to the two tensors on the left side. the courage
and fortitude necessary for this task are stimulated by the previous successes of the method in
sections 2 and 3. the task is eased to some extent by dening the vector

which satises

p 

0
w0

pp  = 1 ,

dp = g + pp ,

dp = d .

we simply give the results of these calculations:

w 



[gh(t)] = g h4t2(t  1)h(t) + 4t (t  1 + d/2) h(t) + 2d h(t)i

+(d + 1)ddh(t)

the remaining task is to use the information in the four independent tensor contributions to
(4.8). we have an overdetermined system of 4 equations for 2 unknown functions, so compati-
bility of the system will provide a check of the method.

the tensor ww does not appear on the right side, and it appears on the left hand side only

in the expansion of ddh and dd

dda(t) =

ww

(w2)2 (cid:16)4t2a(t) + 8ta(t)(cid:17) + . . .

with a(t) = (t) + (1  d)h(t). so we get the condition
(t) ,

h(t) =

1
1  d

(4.14)

(4.15)

where we have chosen the trivial homogeneous solution of 4t2a + 8ta = 0 because any
other solution would be incompatible with the asymptotic behavior of the integral (4.6), which
vanishes as t  0.

equating the contributions of the tensor structure 00/w2 to the l.h.s. and r.h.s. of (4.8)

we get:

4t(1  t)(t) + (8t  2d + 8)(t) = 22

1 t11 .

(4.16)

the equation obtained from the tensor 0{w} w0/(w2)2 differs from (4.16) just in overall sign,
so the rst of the two required compatibility conditions is satised.

finally collection of the terms proportional to g gives

4t2(t1)h(t) + 4t (t  1 + d/2) h(t) + 2d h(t) + 4t(t1) (t) + 2d (t) =
compatibility of this last equation with (4.15) and (4.16) is readily shown as follows. let us
eliminate h(t) from (4.17) using (4.15), and multiply the resulting equation by (d  1)/t. we
obtain

t1 (4.17)

2m2

d  1

4t(1  t)(t) + [(8 + 4d)t  6d + 8] (t) +

2d(d  2)

t

(t) = 2m2

1 t11 .

(4.18)

subtracting (4.18) from (4.16), and using m2

1 = 1(1  d), we get a rst order equation for 
(4.19)

4t(1  t)(t)  2(d  2)(t) = 21t1 ,

which is obviously compatible with (4.16), the latter just being the derivative of the rst order
equation (4.19). we thus conclude that the system of 4 differential equations is consistent and
all of its information is contained in the two simple equations (4.19) and (4.15).

to nd the particular solution of (4.19), as in the scalar and vector cases we consider an

ansatz of the form

with a nite span of values of k, k  {kmin, kmin + 1, . . . , kmax}. we nd:

(t) = xk

(4.20)

(4.21)

(4.22)

(4.23)

the series terminates at kmin = d/2  1  kmax = 1  1 provided 1  d/2 is a nonnegative
integer and d > 2.

actually it is quite trivial to integrate (4.19), and it is instructive to compare the direct solu-

tion with the solution by recursion. the general solution of (4.19) is

(t) = 

1

2 (cid:18) t

t  1(cid:19)

d

2 1 (cid:26)z t

1

dtt1 d

2 (t  1)

d

2 2 + c(cid:27)

(4.24)

where c is arbitrary. assume, for simplicity, that d is an even integer5. for d > 2 one must
choose c = 0 to avoid a singularity at t = 1. the integral solution is then a polynomial in t if
and only if 1  d/2 is a nonnegative integer. for d = 4 and  integer, the result is the simple
polynomial

(t) = 

1

2(1  1)

(t + t2 + . . . + t11) .

(4.25)

for d = 2, there is an unavoidable ln(t  1). this is another indication that the case d = 2
requires special consideration.

the acid test of the new method is to compare with previous results which were given in
[9]. the most direct comparison available is for d = 4 and 1 = 4 for which results were
given in (5.64) and (5.65) of [9]. agreement is perfect after different normalizations are taken
into account. for general 1 and d the new method gives a much more coincise result for the
amplitudes.

5if d

2  2 =  is not an integer, the same conclusions follow if one makes the successive changes of variable

u = t  1 and then u = v with  = 1/.

5 higher point functions

the methods developed in the preceding sections for the calculation of the z-integrals involv-
ing two bulk-to-boundary propagators may be generalized to the case where the bulk-to-bulk
propagator is integrated with an arbitrary number n of bulk-to-boundary propagators. this gen-
eralization will be required when the effects of supergravity couplings of the form n+1 are taken
into account. this will indeed be the case when ads/cft amplitudes are evaluated to higher
order in the supergravity coupling   1/n.

for simplicity, we shall restrict attention here to the case of scalar bulk-to-boundary and
scalar bulk-to-bulk propagators only. we shall assume the dimension d of ads space and of
the scaling dimensions i of all elds to be integers, subject to the unitarity bound i  d/2.
furthermore, we shall assume that at any given interaction vertex, the dimensions of the elds
satisfy the standard triangle inequality, which, for ads5  s5 results directly from the so(6)
r-symmetry.

the starting point is the z-integral, dened by

r(w) = z dzg g(u)

n

yi=1(cid:18)

z0

0 + (~z  ~xi)2(cid:19)i

z2

(5.1)

where g(u) is the scalar propagator of dimension  and mass m2 = ( d), obeying (2.7),
and u is a function of z and w. from (2.7), it is clear that r(w) satises the following differential
equation

(2  m2)r(w) =

here, it is understood that both ~v and 2 are functions of the feynman parameters i. using the

r(w) =

where the scalar function s(w; ; ) satises the differential equation

(2  m2)s(w; ; ) =

w
0

(w2 + 2) .

(5.8)

the key problem is thus to solve for (5.8) as a function of w. once the function s is known, the
function r(w) can be found by carrying out the remaining feynman integrals. as we shall see,
under certain restrictions on the dimensions , i and d, the function s will be polynomial in
w0/(w2 + 2), and thus the feynman integrals to be calculated are of a standard type.

to solve for (5.8), we begin by noticing that the operator 2 applied to a power of w0/(w2 +
2) yields a function of the same type. actually, one may easily show a slightly more general
formula that may be useful to treat the cases of vector and tensor bulk-to-bulk propagators,

w

(w2 + 2)k = (  d)

(w2 + 2)k + 4k(k  )

(5.9)
remarkably, for the case at hand, where k = , this double recursion simplies. subtracting
also the mass term m2 = (  d), as will be needed for the resolution of equation (5.8), we
nd the simple recursion relation

(w2 + 2)k+1  4k(k + 1)2

(w2 + 2)+2 . (5.10)

we now follow the spirit of previous sections and investigate solutions of (5.8) which can be
expressed as a nite series of powers of the variable w0/(w2 + 2). using (5.10) one sees that
this is possible if the highest power is lmax =   2 with lower powers given by l = lmax  2j
where j is a positive integer. the series terminates at lmin =  provided that     2 = 20
is a nonnegative even integer6. (for n = 2 this condition coincides with the condition for a
terminating solution in section 2). substituting (5.10) in (5.8) one nds that the solution takes
the form

with the recursion relation for the coefcients,

s(w; ; ) =

(5.11)

(5.12)

(5.13)

6there is another possible solution which terminates at lmin = d. we do not study this since it is superceded

by the previous solution if  is an integer, as is the case for scalar elds in type iib supergravity.

this recursion relation is easily solved and one nds

remarkably, the conditions for polynomial solutions are precisely obeyed thanks to the r
symmetry selection rules of ads5  s5 supergravity.
