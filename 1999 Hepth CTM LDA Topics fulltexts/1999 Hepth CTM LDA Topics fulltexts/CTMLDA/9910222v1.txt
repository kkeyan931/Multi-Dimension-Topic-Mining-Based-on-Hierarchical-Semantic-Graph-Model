abstract

in these lectures we discuss the application of discrete light cone quantiza-
tion (dlcq) to supersymmetric eld theories. we will see that it is possible to
formulate dlcq so that supersymmetry is exactly preserved in the discrete ap-
proximation. we call this formulation of dlcq, sdlcq and it combines the
power of dlcq with all of the beauty of supersymmetry. in these lecture we will
review the application of sdlcq to several interesting supersymmetric theories.
we will discuss two dimensional theories with (1,1), (2,2) and (8,8) supersymme-
try, zero modes, vacuum degeneracy, massless states, mass gaps, theories in higher
dimensions, and the maldacena conjecture among other subjects.

introduction.

in the last decade there have been signicant improvements in our understanding of
gauge theories and important breakthroughs in the nonperturbative description of su-
persymmetric gauge theories [74, 75].
in the last few years various relations between
string theory, brane theory and gauge elds [35, 2] have also emerged. while these devel-
opments give us some insight into strongly coupled gauge theories [75], they do not oer a
direct method for non-perturbative calculations. in these lectures we discuss some recent
developments in light cone quantization approaches to non-perturbative problems. we
will see that these methods have the potential to expand our understanding of strongly
coupled gauge theories in directions not previously available.

the original idea was formulated half of a century ago [32], but apart from several
technical clarications [63] it remained mostly undeveloped. the rst change came in
the mid 80th when the discrete light cone quantization (dlcq) was suggested as a
practical way for calculating the masses and wavefunctions of hadrons [68]. although
the direct application of the method to realistic problems meets some diculties (for
review see [25]), dlcq has been successful in studying various two dimensional models.
given the importance of supersymmetric theories, it is not surprising that light cone
quantization was ultimately applied to such models [57, 20, 23]. even in this early
work the mass spectrum was shown to be supersymmetric in the continuum and a great
deal of information about the properties of bound states in supersymmetric theories was
extracted. however the straightforward application of dlcq to the supersymmetric
systems had one disadvantage: the supersymmetry was lost in the discrete formulation.
the way to solve this problem was suggested in [64], where an alternative formulation of
dlcq was introduced. namely it was noted that since the supercharge is the square
root of hamiltonian one can dene a new dlcq procedure based on the supercharge.
we will study this formulation (called sdlcq) in these lectures.

these lectures have the following organization. in section 1 we introduce the basic
concepts of dlcq and sdlcq. we also dene the systems to be studied in the remaining
lectures. we will concentrate our attention on two dimensional models with adjoint
matter, several examples of such systems can be constructed from supersymmetric yang
mills theories in higher dimensions using dimensional reduction. in section 2 we address
the problem of the dlcq vacuum. in the continuum theory the light cone vacuum is
very simple:
it coincides with the usual fock vacuum. this property is related to the
decoupling between positive and negative frequency modes on the light cone and does
not occur for equal time quantization. in dlcq however one encounters the problem of
zero modes which complicates the structure of vacuum and allows us to reproduce the
correct vacuum degeneracy in certain theories. we continue to analyze zero modes in
the section 3 and they are shown to play an important role in explaining the dierence
between dlcq and sdlcq regularization procedures.

section 4 is devoted to the study of massless states. our numerical analysis [64,
6, 11, 9] shows an important property of the mass spectrum for some supersymmetric
theories. we nd that unlike the qcdlike models [46], such systems appear to have a

2

lot of massless bound states and in fact the supersymmetric su() gauge theory seems
to have an innite number of such states in the continuum limit. since the states with
zero mass dominate the partition function for low enough temperatures they deserve to
be studied very carefully and in section 4 we analyze the structure of such states.

as we already mentioned in the beginning of this introduction, the relation between
string theory and gauge elds has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. in particu-
lar it was conjectured [61] that one can extract some information about strongly coupled
gauge theory from supergravity calculations. the problem however is that in the rele-
vant regime usual eld theoretic methods do not work, so it is hard to really test the
conjecture. for two dimensional systems, however dlcq gives solutions of the bound
state problem which are valid beyond perturbation theory, so the results can be used to
test the conjecture. we report the results of this rst test in section 5. for realistic sys-
tems with eight supersymmetries we still dont have enough computer power to compare
the results with the supergravity predictions. the general techniques described in this
section can also be used to calculate other correlation functions in the nonperturbative
regime.

finally in section 6 we make a rst attempt to move beyond two dimensions. we
present the general ideas for formulating sdlcq in more than two dimensions. as an
example we present the numerical results of sym for the simplest case when only one
transverse momentum mode is introduced.

supersymmetric yangmills theory in the light
cone gauge.

1.1 dlcq and its supersymmetric version.

in this work we will study the bound state problem for various supersymmetric matrix
models in two dimensions. the examples of such models may be constructed by di-
mensional reduction of supersymmetric yangmills theory in higher dimensions. in this
subsection we will consider such reduction for three dimensional sym. before we begin
the detailed analysis of the bound state problem for the specic systems it is worthwhile
to summarize some basic ideas of discrete light cone quantization ( for a complete
review see [25]).

let us consider a general relativistic system in two dimensions. usual canonical
quantization of such a system means that one imposes certain commutation relations
between coordinates and momenta at equal time. however as was pointed out by dirac
long ago [32] this is not the only possibility. another scheme of quantization treats the
light like coordinate x+ = 12 (x0 + x1) as a new time and then the system is quantized
canonically. this scheme (called light cone quantization) has both positive and negative
sides. the main disadvantage of light cone quantization is the presence of constraints,

3

even for systems as simple as free bosonic eld. from the action

one can derive the constraint relating coordinate and momentum:

s = z d2x+

 = .

(1.1)

(1.2)

for more complicated systems the constraints are also present and in general they are
hard to resolve.

the main advantage of the light cone is the decoupling between positive and negative
momentum modes. this property is crucial for dlcq. in the discrete light cone quan-
tization one considers the theory on the nite circle along the x axis: l < x < l.
then all the momenta become quantized and the integer number measuring the total
momentum in terms of elementary momentum is called the harmonic resolution k.
due to the decoupling property one may work only in the sector with positive momenta
where there are a nite number of states for any nite value of resolution. of course the
full quantum eld theory in the continuum corresponds to the limit l   and , in this
limit the elementary bit of momentum goes to zero, as the harmonic resolution goes to
innity and the innite number of degrees of freedom are restored. however it is believed
that the quantum mechanical approximation is suitable for describing the lowest states
in the spectrum. note that the problem of constraints in dlcq is a quantum mechanical
one and thus it is easier to solve. usually this problem can be reformulated in terms of
zero modes and the solution can be found for any value of the resolution.

dlcq is mainly used in order to solve the bound state problem. let us formulate this
problem for general two dimensional theory. the theory in the continuum has the full
poincare symmetry, thus the states are naturally labeled by the eigenvalues of casimir
operators of the poincare algebra. one such casimir is the mass operator: m 2 = p p.
another casimir is related to the spin of the particle and we will not use it. after
compactifying the x direction one looses lorenz symmetry, but not the translational
invariance in x+ and x directions. thus p + and p  are still conserved charges, but
now the mass operator is not the only casimir of the symmetry group: the states are
characterized by both p + and p . however if we consider dlcq as an approximation
to the continuum theory we anticipate that in the limit of innite harmonic resolution
(or l  ) the poincare symmetry is restored and the mass will be the only quantity
having invariant meaning. thus the aim would be to study the value of m 2 as function
of k and to extrapolate the results to the k = .
in matrix form and then bringing them together:

the usual way to dene m 2 in dlcq is based on separate calculation of p + and p 

m 2 = 2p +p .

(1.3)

usually one works in the sector with xed p +, and the calculation of light cone hamilto-
nian p  is the nontrivial problem. an important simplications occur for supersymmetric
theories [64].

4

supersymmetry is the only nontrivial extension of poincare algebra compatible with
the existence of the s matrix [80]. namely in addition to usual bosonic generators of
symmetries, fermionic ones are allowed and the full (super)algebra in two dimensions
reads:

} = 2ij 

, qj
{qi
[p, p] = 0,

(1.4)

(1.5)

p + z ij,

hp, qi

i = 0.

in this expression  is an antisymmetric 2  2 matrix, 12 = 1 and z ij is the set of
cnumbers called the central charges. in these lectures we will put them equal to zero. it
is convenient to choose two dimensional gamma matrices in the form: 0 = 2, 1 = i1,
then one can rewrite (1.4) in terms of light cone components:

j } = 22ijp +,
i , q+
{q+
{qi , qj } = 22ijp ,
i , qj } = 2zij.
{q+

(1.6)
(1.7)
(1.8)

as we mentioned before, in dlcq diagonalization of p + is trivial and the construction
of hamiltonian is the main problem. the last set of equations suggests an alternative
way of dealing with this problem: one can rst construct the matrix representation
for the supercharge q and then just square it. this version of dlcq rst suggested
in [64] appeared to be very fruitful. first of all it preserves supersymmetry at nite
resolution, while the conventional dlcq applied to supersymmetric theories doesnt (we
will consider the relation between these two approaches in section 3). the supersymmetric
version of dlcq (sdlcq) also provides better numerical convergence.

to summarize, in this subsection we dened two procedures for studying the bound
state spectrum: dlcq and sdlcq. to implement the rst one we construct the light
cone hamiltonian and diagonalize it, while in the second approach one constructions the
supercharge and from it the hamiltonian. of course the sdlcq method is appropriate
only for the theories with supersymmetries, although it can be modied to study models
with soft supersymmetry breaking (see section 6).

1.2 reduction from three dimensions.

let us start by the dening a simple supersymmetric system in two dimensions. it can be
constructed by dimensional reduction of sym from three dimensions to two dimension.
the more general case can be found in the next subsection.

our starting point is the action for sym in 2 + 1 dimensions:

s =z d3xtr(cid:18)

1
4

fabf ab + i ada(cid:19) .

(1.9)

the system consists of gauge eld aa and twocomponent majorana fermion , both
transforming according to adjoint representation of gauge group. we assume that this

5

group is either u(n) or su(n) and thus matrices aa
ij and ij are hermitian. studying
dimensional reduction of sy md we introduce the following conventions for the indices:
the capital latin letters correspond to d dimensional spacetime, greek indices label two
dimensional coordinates and the lower case letters are used as matrix indices. according
to this conventions the indexes in (1.9) go from zero to two, the eld strength fab and
covariant derivative da are dened in the usual way:

fab = aab  baa + ig[aa, ab],
da = a + ig[aa, ].

(1.10)

dimensional reduction to 1 + 1 means that we require all elds to be independent
on coordinate x2, in other words we place the system on the cylinder with radius l
along the x2 axis and consider only zero modes of the elds. the possible improvement
of this approximation will be suggested in section 6, here we consider this reduction
as a formal way of getting two dimensional matrix model. in the reduced theory it is
convenient to introduce two dimensional indices and treat a2 component of gauge eld
as two dimensional scalar . the action for the reduced theory has the form:

s = z d2x tr(cid:18)

1
4

ff  +

1
2

dd + i d  2ig 5(cid:19) ,

(1.11)

we also could choose the special representation of three dimensional gamma matrices:

0 = 2,

1 = i1,

2 = i3,

then it would be natural to write the spinor  in terms of its components:

 = (, )t .

(1.12)

(1.13)

taking all these denitions into account one can rewrite the dimensional reduction of
(1.9) as:

s = lz d2x(cid:18)1
2
+ 2g{, } 

dd + i2d+ + i2d+
ff (cid:19) .

(1.14)

the covariant derivatives here are taken with respect to the light cone coordinates:

x =

x0  x1
2

.

(1.15)

note that by rescaling the elds and coupling constant g we can make the constant l
to be equal to one, so below we simply omit this constant.

the bound state problem for the system (1.14) was rst studied in [64]. the super-
symmetric version of the discrete light cone quantization was used in order to nd the

6

mass spectrum. however the zero modes were neglected by authors of [64], so we spend
some time studying this problem in the next section. as we will see, while zero modes
are not very important for calculations of massive spectrum, they play crucial role in the
description of the vacuum of the theory.

let us consider (1.14) as the theory in the continuum. in this case one can choose

the light cone gauge:

a+ = 0,

then equations of motion for a and  give constraints:

a = gj +,

2i = g[, ],

j +(x) =

1
i

[(x), (x)] 

1
2{(x), (x)}.

(1.16)

(1.17)

(1.18)

(1.19)

solving this constraints and substituting the result back into the action one determines
the lagrangian as function of physical elds  and  only. then using the usual noether
technique we can construct the conserved charges corresponding to the translational
invariance:

p + = z dxtr(cid:16)()2 + i2(cid:17) ,
p  = z dxtr 
ig2

we can also construct the noether charges corresponding to the supersymmetry trans-
formation. however the naive susy transformations break the gauge xing condition
a+ = 0, so they should be accompanied by compensating gauge transformation:

the resulting supercharges are:

q+ = 2z dxtr () ,

q = 2gz dxtr j + 1


(1.22)

(1.23)

(1.24)

finally we make a short comment on supersymmetry in the pure fermionic system. as
one can see the expression for q contains the term cubic in fermions, so if we formally
put  = 0 this supercharge will not vanish. one may ask what kind of supersymmetric
system this supercharge corresponds to. this answer was found by kutasov [57] who

7

discovered the supersymmetry in the system of adjoint fermions, namely the square of
supercharge including fermions only gives hamiltonian:

m2 = g2n/. this p  corresponds to the system of adjoint fermions in two dimensions
with the special value of mass m. we will consider this system in details in section 3.

1.3 reduction from higher dimensions.

in this subsection we consider the general reduction of symd to two dimensions. by
counting the fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom one can see that the sym can be
dened only in limited number of spacetime dimensions, namely d can be equal to 2,
3, 4, 6 or 10. the last case is the most general one: all other system can be obtained
by dimensional reduction and appropriate truncation of degrees of freedom. so in this
subsection we will concentrate on reduction 10  2, and the comments on four and six
dimensional cases will be made in the end.

as in the last subsection we start from ten dimensional action:

s =z d3xtr(cid:18)

1
4

fabf ab + i ada(cid:19) .

(1.26)

according to our general conventions the indexes in (1.26) go from zero to nine, 
is the ten dimensional majoranaweyl spinor. a general spinor in ten dimensions has
210/2 = 32 complex components, if the appropriate basis of gamma matrices is chosen
then majorana condition makes all the components real. since all the matrices in such
representation are real, the weyl condition

is compatible with the reality of  and thus it eliminates half of its components. in the
special representation of dirac matrices:

11 = 

(1.27)

(1.28)
(1.29)
(1.30)
the 11 = 0    9 has very simple form: 11 = 3  116. then the majorana spinor of
positive chirality can be written in terms of 16component real object :

0 = 2  116,
i = i1  i,
9 = i1  9,

i = 1, . . . , 8;

0!.
 = 21/2 

(1.31)

let us return to the expressions for  matrices. the ten dimensional dirac algebra

{, } = 2g

8

is equivalent to the spin(8) algebra for  matrices: {i, j} = 2ij and the ninth matrix
can be chosen to be 9 = 1 . . . 8. note that the 16 dimensional representation of spin(8)
is the reducible one: it can be decomposed as 8s + 8c

i =  0

t
i

i

0 ! ,

i = 1, . . . , 8.

(1.32)

the explicit expressions for the i satisfying {i, j} = 2ij can be found in [36]. such
choice leads to the convenient form of 9:

9 =   18

0

0 18 ! .

(1.33)

so far we have found nonzero components of the spinor given by (1.31). however
as we saw in the last subsection not all such components are physical in the light cone
gauge, so it is useful to perform the analog of decomposition (1.13). in ten dimension
it is related with breaking the sixteen component spinor  on the left and rightmoving
components using the projection operators

pl =

(1  9),

pr =

(1 + 9).

(1.34)

after introducing the lightcone coordinates x = 12(x0  x9) the action (1.26) can be
rewritten as

slc

9+1 = z dx+dxdx tr(cid:18)1

(1.35)

where the repeated indices i, j are summed over (1, . . . , 8). after applying the lightcone
gauge a+ = 0 one can eliminate nonphysical degrees of freedom using the eulerlagrange
equations for l and a:

l =

j + = i[ai , ai] + 22t

(1.36)

(1.37)

(1.38)

performing the reduction to two dimensions means that all elds are assumed to be
independent on the transverse coordinates: i = 0. then as in previous subsection one
can construct the conserved momenta p  in terms of physical degrees of freedom:

p + = z dxtr(cid:16)(ai)2 + i2rr(cid:17) ,
p  = z dxtr

we can also construct the noether charges corresponding to the supersymmetry trans-
formation (1.22). as in the three dimensional case it is convenient to decompose the
supercharge in two components:

q+ = plq,

q = prq.

the resulting eight component supercharges are given by

(1.42)

finally we make a short comment on dimensional reduction of sy m3+1 and sy m5+1.
these systems can be constructed repeating the procedure just described. however there
is an easier way to construct the hamiltonian and supercharges for the dimensionally
reduced theories, namely one has to truncate the unwanted degrees of freedom in the ten
dimensional expressions. this is especially easy for the bosonic coordinates: one simply
considers indices i and j running from one to two (for d = 4) or to four (for d = 6).
the fermionic truncation can also be performed by requiring the spinor r to be 2
or 4component. then the only problem is the choice of 2  2 or 4  4 beta matrices
satisfying
(1.43)

{i, j} = 2ij ,

that can be done easily.

2 zero modes and light cone vacuum.

the results of this section are based on the paper [10]

2.1 gauge fixing in dlcq

we consider the supersymmetric yang-mills theory in 1+1 dimensions [33] which is de-
scribed by the action (1.11):

s = z d2x tr(cid:18)

1
4

ff  +

1
2

dd + i d  2ig 5(cid:19) .

(2.1)

a convenient representation of the gamma matrices is 0 = 2, 1 = i1 and 5 = 3
where a are the pauli matrices. in this representation the majorana spinor is real. we
use the matrix notation for su(n) so that a

ij and ij are n  n traceless matrices.

we now introduce the light-cone coordinates x = 12(x0  x1). the longitudinal
coordinate x is compactied on a nite interval x  [l, l] [63, 68] and we impose
periodic boundary conditions on all elds to ensure unbroken supersymmetry.

10

the light-cone gauge a+ = 0 can not be used in a nite compactication radius,
but the modied condition a+ = 0 [52] is consistent with the light-like compactica-
tion. we can make a global rotation in color space so that the zero mode is diagonalized
ij(x+) = vi(x+)ij with pi vi = 0 [52]. the gauge zero modes correspond to a (quan-
a+
tized) color electric ux loops around the compactied space. the modied light-cone
gauge is not a complete gauge xing. we still have large gauge transformations preserv-
ing the gauge condition a+ = 0. there are two types of such transformations [58, 59]:
displacements td and central conjugations tc. their actions on the physical elds of the
theory and complete gauge xing will be discussed in the end of this subsection. now we
just mention that being discrete transformations, td and tc dont aect quantization
procedure.

the quantization in the lightcone gauge with or without dynamical a+ is widely
explored in the literature [71, 65, 64, 6, 25], here we provide only the results which are
useful for later purposes. the quantization proceeds in two steps. first, we must resolve
the constraints to eliminate the redundant degrees of freedom. there are two constraints
in the theory,

d2
a = gj +,
2id = g[, ],

where   (, )t and the current operator is

j +(x) =

1
i

[(x), d(x)] 

1
2{(x), (x)}.

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

dierent components of (2.2), (2.3) play dierent roles in the theory. first we look
at diagonal zero modes of these equations. the diagonal zero mode of (2.3) gives us
constraints on the physical elds:

[, ]0

ii = 0.

(2.5)

there is no sum over i in above expression. as one can see this constraint leads to
0
ii, this eld plays the role of lagrange multiplier for above condition.

ii , the corresponding constraint is

0
the same is true for
j ii= 0. the reason we treated
the diagonal zero modes of (2.2) and (2.3) separately is that for all other modes the
d operator is invertible and instead of constraints on physical elds  and  one gets
expressions for non-dynamical ones:

a =

[, ].

(2.6)

the next step is to derive the commutation relations for the physical degrees of
freedom. as in the ordinary quantum mechanics, the zero mode vi has a conjugate
momentum p = 2l+vi and the commutation relation is [vi, pj] = iij. the odiagonal
components of the scalar eld are complex valued operators with ij = (ji). the

11

canonical momentum conjugate to ij is ij = (d)ji. they satisfy the canonical
commutation relations [71, 64]

[ij(x), kl(y)]x+=y+ = [ij(x), dlk(y)]x+=y+ =

i
2

(ikjl 

1
n

ijkl)(x  y).

(2.7)

on the other hand, the quantization of the diagonal component ii needs care. as
mentioned in [71], the zero mode of ii, the mode independent of x, is not an independent
degree of freedom but obeys a certain constrained equation [63, 71, 51]. except the zero
mode, the commutation relation is canonical

[ii(x), jj(y)]x+=y+ =

i

(1

(2.8)

the commutator of diagonal and non-diagonal elements of  vanishes. the canonical
anti-commutation relations for fermion elds are [64]

{ij(x), kl(y)}x+=y+ =

1
2

(x  y)(iljk 

1
n

ijkl).

(2.9)

there are two dierences between this expression and one from [64]. first one is technical:
we consider commutators for su(n) group, this gives 1/n term. second dierence is
that unlike [64] we include zero modes in the expansion of , we also include such modes
in non-diagonal elements of .

finally we return to the problem of complete gauge xing. the actions of td and tc

on physical elds are given by [58, 59]:

td :

there are also permutations of the color basis i  p (i) which leave the theory invariant.
these symmetries preserve the gauge condition a+ = 0, but two congurations related
by td, tc or p are equivalent. to x the gauge completely one therefore considers vi
only in the fundamental domain, other regions related with this domain by td, tc or p
give gauge copies of it [37]. the easiest thing to do is to describe the boundaries of
fundamental domain imposed by displacements td:  
2gl. the invariance
under tc limits this region even more, but since we will not need the explicit form of
fundamental domain, we do not discuss such limits for su(n). for the simplest case of
su(2) the fundamental domain is given by 0 < v1 = v2 < 
2gl, the result for su(3)
can be found in [59]. the p symmetries do not respect the fundamental domain, so they

2gl < vi < 

12

are not symmetries of gauge xed theory. however there is one special transformation
among p which being accompanied with combination of td and tc leaves fundamental
domain invariant. namely if r is cyclic permutation of color indexes then there exists a
combination t of td and tc such that s = t r is the symmetry of gauge xed theory.
the explicit form of t depends on the rank of the group, for su(2) and su(3) it may be
found in [59]. the operator s satises the condition sn = 1 and it was used in classifying
the vacua [59, 70].

2.2 current operators

the resolution of the gauss-law constraint (2.2) is a necessary step for obtaining the
light-cone hamiltonian. the expression for the current operator is, however, illdened
unless an appropriate denition is specied, since the operator products are dened at the
same point. we shall use the pointsplitting regularization which respects the symmetry
of the theory under the large gauge transformation.

to simplify notation it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variables zi =
lgvi/ instead of quantum mechanical coordinates vi describing a+. the modeexpanded
elds at the light-cone time x+ = 0 are

where kn = n/l, uij(n) = 1/q|n  zi + zj| 1. the (anti)commutation relations for

fourier modes are found in [71, 65] and in our notation they take the form

[aij(n), akl(m)] = sgn(n + zj  zi)n,m(ikjl

(2.13)

the zero modes in above relations deserve special consideration. although we formally
wrote them as aij(0) and bij(0), these modes also act as creation operators because the
conjugation of zero mode gives another zero mode:

aij(0) = aji(0),

bij(0) = bji(0).

(2.14)

in particular the diagonal components of fermionic zero mode are real and we will use
them later to describe the degeneracy of vacua. now we concentrate our attention on

)2 in the gauss-law constraint have

non-diagonal zero modes. in the fundamental domain all zi are dierent, then one can
always make take them to satisfy the inequality zn < zn1 < . . . < z1 in this domain.
such condition together with (2.13) leads to interpretation of aij(0) as creation operator
if i < j and as annihilation operator otherwise. the situation for fermions is more
ambiguous. one can consider bij(0) as creation operator either when i < j or when
i > j, both assumptions are consistent with (2.13). later we will explore each of these
situations.

let us now discuss the denition of singular operator products in the current (2.4).

we dene the current operator by point splitting:

j +  lim
where the divided pieces are given by

0(cid:16)j +

(2.17)

here m is diagonal matrix: m = diag(z1, . . . , zn ). an advantage of this regularization
is that the current transforms covariantly under the large gauge transformation.

to evaluate (2.16) and (2.17) we will generalize the approach used in [71, 65] to the
su(n) case. first let us calculate the vacuum average of bosonic current. taking into
account the interpretation of zero modes as creationannihilation operators we obtain:

the zero modes of the diagonal color sectors in which the notorious constrained zero mode

the minus sign here corresponds to the case where bij(0) is a creation operator if i < j
(i.e. the convention is the same as for the bosons) and plus corresponds to the opposite
situation. as can be seen, j +
 acquire extra z dependent terms, so called
gauge corrections. integrating these charges over x, one nds that the charges are time
dependent. of course this is an unacceptable situation, and implies the need to impose
special conditions to single out physical states to form a sensible theory. the important
simplication of the supersymmetric model is that these time dependent terms cancel,
and the full current (2.15) becomes

depending on the convention for fermionic zero modes the z independent constants ci
either vanish or they are given by

(n + 1  2i).

(2.22)

the regularized current is thus equivalent to the naive normal ordered current up to an
irrelevant constant. similarly, one can show that p + picks up gauge correction when the
adjoint scalar or adjoint fermion are considered separately but in the supersymmetric
theory it is nothing more than the expected normal ordered contribution of the matter
elds.

in one sense these results are a consequence of the well known fact that the normal
ordering constants in a supersymmetric theory cancel between fermion and boson con-
tributions. the important point here is that these normal ordered constants are not
actually constants, but rather quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. it is therefore
not obvious that they should cancel. of course, this property profoundly eects the
dynamics of the theory.

2.3 vacuum energy

the wave function of the vacuum state for the supersymmetric yang-mills theory in 1+1
dimensions has already been discussed in the equal-time formulation [67]. an eective
potential is computed in a weak coupling region as a function of the gauge zero mode by
using the adiabatic approximation. here we analyze the vacuum structure of the same
theory in the context of the dlcq formulation.

the presence of zero modes renders the light-cone vacuum quite nontrivial, but the
advantage of the light-cone quantization becomes evident: the ground state is the fock
vacuum for a xed gauge zero mode and therefore our ground state may be written in
the tensor product form

where we have taken the schrodinger representation for the quantum mechanical degree
of freedom z which is dened in the fundamental domain. in contrast, to nd the ground

|i  [z]  |0i,

(2.23)

15

state of the fermion and boson for a xed value of the gauge zero mode turns out to be
a highly nontrivial task in the equal-time formulation [67].

our next task is to derive an eective hamiltonian acting on [z]. the light-cone
hamiltonian h  p  is obtained from energy momentum tensors, or through the canon-
ical procedure:

(2.24)

(2.25)

where the rst term is the kinetic energy of the gauge zero mode, and in the second
term the zero modes of d are understood to be removed. note that the kinetic term
of the gauge zero mode is not the standard form d2/dz2 but acquires a nontrivial
jacobian k which is nothing but the haar measure of su(n). the jacobian originates
from the unitary transformation of the variable from a+ to v, and can be derived by
explicit evaluation of a functional determinant [58, 59]. in the present context it is found
in [51]. also we mention that hamiltonian (2.24) seems to contain terms quadratic in

0
diagonal zero modes
ii. however using constraint equations one can show that the total
contribution of all such term vanishes. this also can be seen by using the fact that
hamiltonian is proportional to the square of supercharge (2.34).

projecting the light-cone hamiltonian onto the fock vacuum sector we obtain the

quantum mechanical hamiltonian

respectively. as stated in the previous subsection, the gauge invariantly regularized
current turns out to be precisely the normal ordered current in the absence of the zero
modes. it is now straightforward to evaluate vjj and v in terms of modes. one nds
that they cancel among themselves as expected from the supersymmetry:

vjj = v =

(2.29)

this cancellation was found as the result of formal manipulations with divergent series
like ones in the right hand side of the last formula. such transformations are not well
dened mathematically and as the result they may lead to the nite anomalous con-
tribution. the famous chiral anomaly initially was found as the result of careful analysis
of transformations analogous to ones we just performed [1]. however if one considers
derivatives of vjj or v with respect to any zi then all the sums become convergent,
the order of summations becomes interchangeable and as the result the derivatives of
vjj + v vanish. thus if there is any anomaly in the expression above it is given by z
independent constant. such constant in the hamiltonian would correspond to the shift
of energy levels and usually it is ignored. however in supersymmetric case there is a
natural choice for such constant: in order for vacuum to be supersymmetric it should be
zero. below we assume that susy is not broken, then we expect that (2.29) is true.

thus we arrive at

h0 = 

g2l
42

.

(2.30)

the relevant solutions of this equation should be nite in the fundamental domain, this
requirement leads to discrete spectrum due to the fact that jacobian vanishes on the
boundary of this domain. however the operator h0 is elliptic, and therefore it cant have
negative eigenvalues. if the eigenvalue problem

h0(z) = e(z)

(2.31)

has a solution for e = 0, this solution corresponds to the ground state of the theory.
it is easy to see that such solution exists and it is given by (z) = const 2. we have
thus found that the ground state has a vanishing vacuum energy, suggesting that the
supersymmetry is not broken spontaneously.

2.4 supersymmetry and degenerate vacua.

as we saw in the previous subsection supersymmetry leads to the cancellation of the
anomaly terms in current operator. however these terms played an important role in
the description of zn degeneracy of vacua [70], so we should nd another explanation of
this fact here. it appears that fermionic zero modes give a natural framework for such
treatment.

2some authors prefer to rewrite this to include the measure in the denition of the wave function and

then in su(2) for example the ground state wave function is a sin

17

first we will generalize the supersymmetry transformation given in [64] to the present
case, i.e. we include a+ and the zero modes of fermions. the naive susy transformations
spoil the gauge xing condition, so we combine them with compensating gauge transfor-
mation following [64]. in three dimensional notation (spinors have two components and
indices go from 0 to 2) the result reads:

a =

(2.32)

the dierence between above expression and those in [64] is that we include the zero
modes. namely we dened  as the complete eld with all the zero modes included and
 as fermion without diagonal zero modes. the introducing of  is necessary, because
diagonal zero modes form the kernel of operator d, so 1
is not dened on this subspace.
in particular we are interested in supersymmetry transformations for a+ and fermionic
zero modes. performing a mode expansion one can check that diagonal elements of matrix
[ 1

(2.33)

this expression is written in two component notation and the decomposition of spinor

:  = (+, )t is used. note that since q = 2(+q + q+) the elds involved in

transformations (2.33) dont contribute to q+, this is consistent to the fact that being
x independent they dont contribute to p +. the equations (2.33) look like supersym-
metry transformation for the quantum mechanical system built from free bosons and free
fermions. in fact as one can see the supercharge q is the sum of supercharge for the
quantum mechanical system and from the qft without diagonal zero modes:

q = 2gz dxtr(j + 1
d

) + 4ltr(+a+

0
).

(2.34)

calculating (q)2 and writing the momentum conjugate to a+ as dierential operator 3
we reproduce hamiltonian (2.24). note that  there has all the zero modes in it. the
square of another supercharge

q+ = 2z dxtr(d)

(2.35)

gives p + while the anti-commutator of q with q+ is proportional to the constraint
(2.5) and thus vanishes.

the qft term has non-trivial dependence on the quantum mechanical coordinate.

the region for n is determined taking into account the fact that

rst mentioned in [81].
in addition to this discrete vacuum degeneracy supersymmetric theories also have a
continuum space of vacua called moduli space.
in dlcq approach the moduli space
is easy to understand. let us suppose that scalar eld  developed a vev. to have
a consistent theory this vev should commute with the wilson loop in the compact

direction, which in our case happened to be exp(ir dxa+). since a+ is a general
diagonal matrix this leads to the condition for the vev: hiji = wiij. now we can make
the substitution    + hi in the supercharges (2.34) to nd the correction in q due
to the scalar vev:
(2.39)

q = 2igtr(cid:18)wz dx[](cid:19) .

we used integration by part and the equation dw = 0. taking into account the
fermionic constraint (2.5) we conclude that for any diagonal w: q = 0, i.e. we can

19

choose the state with arbitrary vev hiji as the new vacuum. this is precisely the
moduli space of the theory: the models constructed starting from dierent vacua are not
coupled with each other.

2.5 solving for massive bound states.

as we saw the zero modes play an important role in the description of the vacuum.
however solving for massive bound states one usually neglect the zero mode contribution.
does this lead to errors in the mass spectrum? the answer depends on the problem we are
solving. if one is interested in the spectrum of the theory at the nite value of resolution
then zero modes are important, but as we will show their contribution becomes smaller
and smaller as the resolution goes to innity, so they may be neglected if one is interested
only in the large k extrapolation.

first let us formulate the dlcq problem with zero modes precisely. we will use the
hamiltonian formulation, but the consideration for sdlcq formalism is the same. the
space of states of the theory is the direct product of fock space and quantum mechanical
hilbert space for zero modes: a general state can be written as

the hamiltonian has the form:

|statei = (z)  |f ockstatei,

h = k(z) + v (z, a, a, b, b).

(2.40)

(2.41)

here k(z) is some dierential operator, while v is some function of zero modes z and
creationannihilation operators (see for example (2.24)). in general one should solve the
bound state problem h|i = e|i in two steps: rst one should determine the eective
potential v :
(2.42)

v (z, a, a, b, b)|f ockstatei = v (z)kf ockstatei

and then solve the schrodinger equation for zero modes:

(k(z) + v (z))(z) = e(z).

(2.43)

however in practice this is hard to carry out. fortunately, solving the schrodinger
equation is not important for calculating the continuum limit of mass spectrum. the
reason for this is the following.

studying the large l limit in dlcq one is usually interested in situation when the

total momentum p + = p ni/l is kept xed. then most of the terms in v (and thus in

v ) are of order l0, while k(z) scales like l. assume for a moment that the whole v is
of order one, then one can consider v as perturbation and use the standard expression
for the eigenvalue:

ei = e(0)

i +z dzi (z) v (z)i(z),

(2.44)

20

i

where e(0)
and i(z) are eigenvalue and eigenfunction of unperturbed system. to get
nite masses in the continuum limit only the ground state of k(z) should be considered:
i = 0 and e(0)

0 = 0 in the last expression. introducing the averaging procedure as

hai = z dz0(z)a(z)0(z)

(2.45)

we nd: e = h v i and thus the continuum eigenvalues are just solutions of the z
independent equation:

hv (a, a, b, b)i|f ockstatei = e|f ockstatei.

(2.46)

the assumption of l0 scaling for v is not the trivial one. namely it is responsible for
the dierence in the constraint equations in dlcq and continuum cases. for example
looking at the hamiltonian (2.24) one can see that v (z) includes a term linear in l:

g2l
2

1

(zi  zj)2

j +
ij (0) j +

ji (0),

(2.47)

so the assumption being false for v may be satised for v only dynamically. one

can make this specic term vanish if instead of dlcq constraint r dxjii(x) = 0 its

continuum version

z dxjij(x) = 0

(2.48)

is used. of course imposing this condition is not enough to make all the terms in v
to be of order l0, but following the usual path in dlcq calculations we choose not to
impose other conditions explicitly. in our numerical study we rather perform calculations
with hamiltonian hv (a, a, b, b)i in the sector satisfying (2.48) and then concentrate our
attention only on states whose masses can be extrapolated to nite value. this way we
make sure that our assumption v  1 holds and thus the z dependence is not important.
to summarize, we have shown that zero modes of gauge eld and diagonal zero modes
of fermions play an important role in the description of vacuum structure. however if
studying the bound state problem for the states with nonzero total momentum p + one
is interested only in the extrapolation to the continuum limit, the zero mode of a+ can
be omitted from the theory. this fact leads to signicant simplications in the numerical
procedure. as soon as a+ is excluded from the theory one also has to exclude the bosonic
zero modes (otherwise the expression 1/0 is encountered in the (2.12)). what about the
fermionic zero modes? in principle we can either keep them or disregard them. however
in the latter case one should be very careful: as we will see in the next section such modes
play an important role in the ensuring of supersymmetry.

3 fermionic zero modes and exact supersymmetry.

in this section we study the relation between conventional dlcq and its supersymmetric
version. since usual dlcq is formulated for the hamiltonian we should rewrite sdlcq

21

in the same form. here one encounters the rst dierence between two schemes:
in
dlcq the fermions can be chosen to be either periodic or antiperiodic on x, but in the
hamiltonian formulation of sdlcq they must be periodic due to supersymmetry. then
one encounters the problem of fermionic zero modes. however the boundary conditions
is not the only dierence between the two approaches. even after we choose periodic
fermions, dlcq still has an ambiguity emerging from the choice of regularization scheme.
taking the simplest susy system as an example we will show that supersymmetry
dictates the unique regularization and we study the relation between this prescription
and the principal value scheme, which is usually used in the dlcq calculations. we
show that fermionic zero modes play an important role in deriving this relation.

as we already mentioned in section one the simplest supersymmetric system in two
dimension is the one involving only gauge elds and adjoint fermions [57]. we derive all
the relations for this particular system.

3.1 zero modes and supersymmetric regularization.

we consider the 1 + 1 dimensional su(n) gauge theory coupled to an adjoint majorana
fermion. the light-cone quantization of this model in the light-cone gauge and large n
limit has been dealt with explicitly before [29, 20]. the expressions for the light-cone
momentum p + and light-cone hamiltonian p  for this model are

p + = z dxtr(i2),
p  = z dxtr

it is well known that at a special
value of fermionic mass (namely m2 = g2n/) this system is supersymmetric [57]. this
special value of the fermion mass will be denoted by msu sy . at this supersymmetric
point, the supercharge is given by

q = 2gz dxtr(

(3.3)

which satises the supersymmetry relation {q, q} = 22p . this may be checked

explicitly by using the anticommutator at equal x+:

{ij(x), kl(y)} =

1
2

iljk(x  y).

(3.4)

in the dlcq formulation, the theory is regularized by a light-like compactication, and
either periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions may be imposed for fermions.
if
p + denotes the total light-cone momentum, light-like compactication is equivalent to
restricting the light-cone momentum of partons to be non-negative integer multiples of

22

p +/k, where k is some positive integer that is sent to innity in the decompactied
limit4. anti-periodic boundary conditions will in general explicitly break the supersym-
metry in the discretized theory, although supersymmetry will be restored in the decom-
pactication limit k   [20]. if we wish to maintain supersymmetry at any nite k,
we must at least impose periodic boundary conditions for the fermions. this, however,
leads to the notorious zero-mode problem5. from a numerical perspective, omitting
zero-momentum modes in our analysis is absolutely necessary, since it guarantees a nite
fock basis for each nite resolution k. the mass spectrum of the continuum theory
may be obtain by extrapolating from a sequence of nite mass matrices m 2 = 2p +p .
but are we really justied in omitting the zero-momentum modes? to date, the gen-
eral consensus is that omitting zero momentum modes in a two dimensional interacting
eld theory does not aect the spectrum of the decompactied theory, where k  .
actually, the numerical results of the next subsection are consistent with this viewpoint.
however, the goal of this work is to understand the structure of a supersymmetric
theory at nite resolution. as we will see shortly, understanding why the dlcq and
sdlcq prescriptions dier involves studying certain intermediate zero-momentum pro-
cesses. but rst, we need to be more precise about the form of the light-cone operators
of the theory. if we expand the fermion eld ij in terms of its fourier components, we
may express the uncompactied light-cone supercharge and hamiltonian in a momentum
space representation involving fermion creation and annihilation operators: ([57, 29, 20]):

4 k is sometimes called the harmonic resolution, or just resolution.
5 for anti-periodic boundary conditions, the light-cone momentum of partons is restricted to odd

integer multiples of p +/k, and so there are no zero-momentum modes in such a formulation.

23

as we mentioned earlier, the continuum theory is supersymmetric for a special value
of fermion mass. we will therefore consider only the case m = msu sy . in the dlcq
formulation, one simply restricts integration of the light-cone momenta ki in expression
(3.6) for p  above to be positive integer multiples of p +/k. i.e. one simply drops the
zero-momentum mode. the dlcq mass spectrum is then obtained by diagonalizing
the mass operator m 2 = 2p +p . similarly, in the sdlcq formulation, the light-cone
momenta ki in expression (3.5) for q are restricted to positive integer multiples of p +/k.

one then simply denes p  to be the square of the supercharge: 22p  = {q, q}.

the mass operator m 2 = 2p +p  is then easily constructed and diagonalized to obtain
the sdlcq spectrum.

in general, the following observations are made; at nite resolution, the dlcq spec-
trum of a supersymmetric theory is not supersymmetric. however, supersymmetry is
restored after extrapolating to the continuum limit k   (see [20], for example). in
contrast, for any nite resolution, the sdlcq spectrum is supersymmetric. the dlcq
and sdlcq spectra agree only in the decompactied limit k  .
not surprisingly, the dierence in the dlcq and sdlcq prescriptions at nite reso-
lution may be understood as a zero-mode contribution. what is surprising is that we can
encode the eect of these zero-mode contributions into a simple well dened operator.
the main result here is the the precise operator form of this contribution at nite k.

in order to motivate our argument, note that the anticommutator for the supercharge
q in the continuum theory involves products of terms of the form b(k)b(0)b(k) and
b(p)b(0)b(p), and these provide contributions to p  that may be expressed in terms of
non-zero momentum modes. the problem is exacerbated by the fact that the coecients
of these terms behave singularly. to examine this more closely, we consider the discretized
theory where the light-cone momenta ki in the expression for q [eqn(3.5)] are restricted
to positive integer multiples of p +/k. we also include the eects of zero-momentum
modes by introducing an  regulated zero mode, which are modes with momentum
ki = , where  is much less than p +/k, and is sent to zero at the end of the calculation.
then the anticommutator of two q gives contributions of the following form:

vanishes, while the rst term is the pure momentumindependent divergence that was
identied in an earlier study of this model [20], and is canceled if we adopt a principal
value prescription for singular amplitudes in the denition of p . the second term

(3.8)

24

however, is clearly a nite contribution to p , although it arises from the  regulated
zero modes in q, which are not present in the sdlcq prescription for dening q.

consequently, in order to ensure the supersymmetry relation {q, q} = 22p  in the

discretized formulation, we must include an  regularization of the zero modes in the
denition for q, and then apply a principal value prescription in the presence of any
singular processes to eliminate 1/ divergences.

stated slightly dierently, we may decompose the supercharge into a part without
zero modes qsdlcq (i.e. ki = np +/k, n = 1, 2, . . .), and terms with  regularized zero
modes, q . the anti-commutator {qsdlcq, q } contains only terms with  regulated
zero-modes. since q = qsdlcq + q one nds

{qsdlcq, qsdlcq} = 22p sdlcq = 22p dlcq  {q , q }p v ,

(3.9)
after dropping any  regulated zero-mode terms in the calculated expression for {q, q}.
note that the rst equality above is just the denition for the light-cone hamiltonian
p  in the sdlcq prescription. the p v abbreviation on the right hand side indicates
a principal value regularization prescription, which is tantamount to dropping all 1/
terms as   0. the procedure is well known in the context of the present model
[20]. it is clear that our denition for p sdlcq gives rise to the supersymmetry relation
[qsdlcq, p sdlcq] = 0, which yields a supersymmetric spectrum for any nite resolution
k. moreover, we know that p sdlcq and p dlcq yield the same spectrum in the contin-
uum limit k  , so it remains to calculate the dierence at nite resolution k. we
will write this dierence in terms of their respective mass operators: m 2 = 2p +p . a
straightforward calculation of the anticommutator on the right-hand-side of (3.9) leads
to the result:

magnitude. thus the action of the right hand side of (3.10) is equivalent to the single

fortunately, we are able to test this analytical result by performing direct numerical sim-
ulations of this model using both prescriptions, and comparing the dierences observed
with the above prediction. interestingly, although this result was derived for large n,
agreement turns out to be perfect for both nite and large n, which was veried using
the nite n dlcq algorithms developed in [13]. we discuss this further in the next
subsection.

3.2 soft susy breaking and numerical results.

in this subsection we compare the numerical results for dierent regularization schemes.
although in the continuum limit both pv and susy prescription ns should give the same
results, the convergence of the masses as k   might be dierent. so if at a given value
of k one wants to get a better approximation to continuum masses, one scheme might
work better than other. in previous subsection we described two regularization schemes
and found the operator m 2
 describing the dierence between them. it is convenient to
introduce the family of regularizations labeled by parameter y :

p y = p p v + y m 2
.

(3.13)

then at two special values of y we get the pv and susy prescriptions: p p v = p y =0,
p su sy = p y =1. since p p v is dened for arbitrary value of fermionic mass m (not only for
supersymmetric one) the last equation also denes the family of regularizations beyond
the susy point. on the other hand shifting the fermionic mass from its supersymmetric
value is equivalent to introducing additional fermionic mass, i.e. to the soft susy break-
ing. below we will give a numerical results for bound state masses in the theory with
two new coupling constants: x = m2
g2n and y which determine the value of fermionic
mass and regularization scheme accordingly.

our investigation of this theory indicates that at x = 1 ( the supersymmetric value
of the fermion mass) the lightest fermionic and bosonic bound states are degenerate with
continuum masses approximately m 2 = 26 [20, 6]. using p su sy we arrive at the same
conclusion for any value of y .

boorstein and kutasov [23] have investigated soft supersymmetry breaking for small
values of this dierence, x  1 and they found that the degeneracy between the fermion

26

and boson bound state masses is broken according to

m 2

f (x)  m 2

b(x) = (1  x)mb(1) + o((x  1)3).

(3.14)

they calculated these masses using the pv prescription (y = 0) with anti-periodic
bc and found very good agreement with the theoretical prediction. we have compared
this theoretical prediction at y = 1 and we nd that eq (3.14) is very well satised. at
resolution k = 5, for example, the slope is 4.76 and the predicted slope mb(1) is 4.76.
the indication is that this result is true for any value of y .

state in units of g2n/ as a function of x = m/g2n and y (b)the contour plots of
y = y (x) for the mass squared of the second lowest bound state in units of g2n/ as a
function of x = m/g2n and y (b)

in fig. 1 we show the contour plots of the mass squared m 2 of the two lightest
bosonic bound states as a function of x and y at resolution k = 10. these contours
are lines of constant mass squared. selecting a particular value of the mass of the rst
bound state then xes a particular contour in fig. 1a as a contour of xed mass, which
we can write as y = yp(x).

interestingly, constructing the same contour plot for the next to lightest bosonic
bound state  see fig. 1b  yields contours that have approximately the same functional
dependence implied by fig. 1a. in fact, one obtains approximately the same contour plots
for the next twenty bound states (which is as far as we checked). the simple conclusion
is that the coupling y which represents the strength of the additional operator aects all
bound state masses more or less equally. this in turn suggests that at nite resolution,
we can smoothly interpolate between dierent values of fermion mass x, and dierent

27

prescriptions specied by the coupling y , without aecting too much the actual numerical
spectrum. of course, in the decompactication limit k  , such a dependence on y
disappears, due to scheme independence.
since the lightest bosonic bound state is primarily a two particle state it is reasonable
to truncate the fock basis to two particle states. this will permit very high resolutions,
which will be needed to carefully scrutinize any possible discrepancies between the two
versions of soft symmetry breaking presented here. in fact, we are able to study the
theory for k up to 800. the mass of the lowest state as a function of the resolution for
various values of x and y are shown in fig. 2. each converging pair of lines  which
extrapolate the actual data points  in fig. 2 corresponds to dierent values of fermion
mass x. the top upper curve in each pair runs through data points that were calculated
via sdlcq (i.e. y = 1), while the lower corresponds to the pv (i.e. y = 0) prescription
commonly adopted in the literature. we nd that each pair of curves converge to the
same point at innite resolution, although this may not be completely obvious for the
lowest pair in the gure (corresponding to the critical mass x = 0).

away from x = 0, the sdlcq formulation is tted with a linear function of 1/k,
while the pv formulation is t with a polynomial of 1/k 2, where  is the solution of
1  x/2 = cot() [79]. it now appears that sdlcq not only provides more rapid
convergence for supersymmetric models, but also for the massive thooft model, which
is not supersymmetric. for the massless case, the situation is reversed; the sdlcq
formulation converges slower. it is t by a polynomial in 1/log(k) and gives the same
mass at innite resolution as the pv formulation. this behavior may be understood
from the observation that the wave function of this state does not vanish at x = 0. we
have looked closely at small masses, such as x = .1, and one nds that both pv and
sdlcq vary as a polynomial in 1/k 2 at large resolution. thus careful extrapolation
schemes must be adopted at small masses.

we therefore conclude that the continuum of regularization schemes that interpo-
late smoothly between the sdlcq and pv prescriptions  which we characterized by
the parameter y  yield the same continuum bound state masses, although the rate of
convergence of the dlcq spectrum may be altered signicantly. this implies that the
contour plots observed in fig. 1 eventually approach lines parallel to the y axis, and the
sole dependence on the parameter x is recovered.

interestingly, since the two-body equation studied here for the adjoint fermion model
is simply the thooft equation with a rescaling of coupling constant, we have arrived at
an alternative prescription for regulating the coulomb singularity in the massive thooft
model that improves the rate of convergence towards the actual continuum mass. thus,
a prescription that arises naturally in the study of supersymmetric theories is also appli-
cable in the study of a theory without supersymmetry. we believe that this idea deserves
to be exploited further in a wider context of theories. in particular, it is an open question
whether this procedure could provide a sensible approach to regularizing softly broken
gauge theories with bosonic degrees of freedom, and in higher dimensions.

in any case, it appears that the special cancellations aorded by supersymmetry

especially in the context of dlcq bound state calculations  might have scope beyond
the domain of supersymmetric eld theory. this would be a crucial rst step towards a
serious non-perturbative study of theories with broken supersymmetry.

4 massless states in two dimensional models.

in this section we will study the structure of bound states for two dimensional super-
symmetric models dened in section 1. we will concentrate most of the attention on
the model obtained by dimensional reduction from sym2+1. for this theory we will
prove that any normalizable bound state in the continuum must include a contribution
with arbitrarily large number of partons. by generalizing this proof to the theories with
extended susy we show that this is the general property of supersymmetric matrix
models. this scenario is to be contrasted with the simple bound states discovered in
a number of 1 + 1 dimensional theories with complex fermions, such as the schwinger
model, the thooft model, and a dimensionally reduced theory with complex adjoint
fermions [12, 69]. we also study the massless states of sym2+1 in dlcq. some of them
are constructed explicitly and the general formula for the number of massless states as
function of harmonic resolution is derived for the large n case. this section is based in
part on the results of [5].

formulation of the bound state problem.

the light-cone formulation of the supersymmetric matrix model obtained by dimension-
ally reducing n = 1 sym2+1 to 1 + 1 dimensions was initially given in [64], and it was
summarized in the section 2 of these lectures. we simply note here that the light-cone
hamiltonian p  is given in terms of the supercharge q via the supersymmetry relation
{q, q} = 22p , where

q = 23/4gz dxtr((i[, ] + 2)

) .

(4.1)

in the above, ij = ij(x+, x) and ij = ij(x+, x) are n  n hermitian matrix
elds representing the physical boson and fermion degrees of freedom (respectively) of
the theory, and are remnants of the physical transverse degrees of freedom of the original
2 + 1 dimensional theory. this is a special feature of light-cone quantization in light-
cone gauge: all unphysical degrees of freedom present in the original lagrangian may be
explicitly eliminated. there are no ghosts.

in order to quantize  and  on the light-cone, we rst introduce the following ex-

pansions at xed light-cone time x+ = 0 (the continuum counterpart of (2.12):

for the bound state eigen-problem 2p +p | >= m 2| >, we may restrict to the
subspace of states with xed light-cone momentum p +, on which p + is diagonal, and so
the bound state problem is reduced to the diagonalization of the light-cone hamiltonian
p . since p  is proportional to the square of the supercharge q, any eigenstate | >
of p  with mass squared m 2 gives rise to a natural four-fold degeneracy in the spectrum

although this four-fold degeneracy is realized in the continuum formulation of the the-
ory, this property will not necessarily survive if we choose to discretize the theory in
an arbitrary manner. however, a nice feature of sdlcq is that it does preserve the
supersymmetry (and hence the exact four-fold degeneracy) for any resolution.

focusing attention on zero mass eigenstates, we simply note that a massless eigen-
state of p  must also be annihilated by the supercharge q, since p  is proportional to
(q)2. thus the relevant eigen-equation is q| >= 0. we wish to study this equation.
however, rst we need to state the explicit equation for q, in the momentum represen-
tation, which is obtained by substituting the quantized eld expressions (4.2) and (4.3)
directly into the the denition of the supercharge (4.1). the result is:

in order to implement the dlcq formulation [68, 63] of the theory, we simply restrict
the momenta k1, k2 and k3 appearing in the above equation to the following set of allowed
momenta: { p +
k , . . .}. here, k is some arbitrary positive integer, and must be
sent to innity if we wish to recover the continuum formulation of the theory. the
integer k is called the harmonic resolution, and 1/k measures the coarseness of our
discretization. physically, 1/k represents the smallest unit of longitudinal momentum
fraction allowed for each parton. as soon as we implement the dlcq procedure, which
is specied unambiguously by the harmonic resolution k, the integrals appearing in
the denition of q are replaced by nite sums, and the eigen-equation q| >= 0 is
reduced to a nite matrix problem. for suciently small values of k (in this case for
k  4) this eigen-problem may be solved analytically. for values k > 5, we may still
compute the dlcq supercharge analytically as a function of n, but the diagonalization
procedure must be performed numerically.

for now, we concentrate on the structure of the zero mass eigenstates for the contin-
uum theory. firstly, note that for the u(n) bound state problem, massless states appear
automatically because of the decoupling of the u(1) and su(n) degrees of freedom that
constitute u(n). more explicitly, we may introduce the u(1) operators

(k+) =

1
n

tr[a(k+)] and (k+) =

1
n

tr[b(k+)],

(4.8)

31

which allow us to decompose any u(n) operator into a sum of u(1) and su(n) operators:

a(k+) = (k+)  1nn + a(k+) and b(k+) = (k+)  1nn + b(k+),

(4.9)
where a(k+) and b(k+) are traceless n  n matrices. if we now substitute the operators
above into the expression for the supercharge (4.7), we nd that all terms involving the
u(1) factors (k+), (k+) vanish  only the su(n) operators a(k+), b(k+) survive.
i.e.
starting with the denition of the u(n) supercharge, we end up with the denition of the
su(n) supercharge. in addition, the (anti)commutation relations [aij(k1), (k2)] = 0
and {bij(k1), (k2)} = 0 imply that this supercharge acts only on the su(n) creation
operators of a fock state - the u(1) creation operators only introduce degeneracies in the
su(n) spectrum. clearly, since q has no u(1) contribution, any fock state made up
of only u(1) creation operators must have zero mass. the non-trivial problem here is to
determine whether there are massless states for the su(n) sector. we will address this
topic next.

4.2 the proof for (1,1) model.

it was pointed out in the previous subsection that a zero mass eigenstate is annihilated
by the light-cone supercharge (4.7):

q|i = 0

(4.10)

we wish to show that if such an su(n) eigenstate is normalizable, then it must involve
a superposition of an innite number of fock states. the basic strategy is quite simple:
normalizability will impose certain conditions on the light-cone wave functions as one or
several momentum variables vanish. moreover, if we assume a given eigenstate |i has
at most n partons, then the terms in q|i consisting of n + 1 partons must sum to zero,
providing relations between the n parton wave functions only. we then show these wave
functions must all vanish by studying various zero momentum limits of these relations.
interestingly, the utility of studying light-cone wave functions at small momenta also
appears in the context of light-front qcd3+1 [3].

in order to proceed with a systematic presentation of the proof, we start by considering
the large n limit case. this simply means that we consider fock states that are made
from a single trace of a product of boson or fermion creation operators acting on the
light-cone fock vacuum |0i. multiple trace states correspond to 1/n corrections to the
theory, and are therefore ignored. in this limit, a general state |i is a superposition of
fock states of any length, and may be written in the form

|i =

xn=2

(q1, . . . , qn)tr[c(q1) . . . c(qn)]|0i,

(4.11)

32

where c(q+) represents either a boson or fermion creation operator carrying light-cone
momentum q+, and f (n,r)
denotes the wave function of an n parton fock state containing
r fermions in a particular arrangement p .
it is implied that we sum over all such
arrangements, which may not necessarily be distinct with respect to cyclic symmetry of
the trace.

p

at this point, we simply remark that normalizability of a general state |i above

we are now ready to carry out the details of the proof. but rst a little notation.
we will write |(n,m)i to denote a superposition of all fock states  as in (4.11)  with
precisely n partons, m of which are fermions. such a fock expansion involves only the
wave functions f (n,m)
, and the number of them is enumerated by the index p . for the
special case |(n,0)i (i.e. no fermions), there is only one wave function, which we denote
by f (n,0) for brevity:
|(n,0)i =z p +
(q1 + ... + qn  p +) f (n,0)(q1...qn)tr[a(q1)...a(qn)]|0i. (4.13)
there is another special case we wish to consider; namely, the state |(n,2)i consisting
of n parton fock states with precisely two fermions. if we place one of the fermions at
the beginning of the trace, then there are n  1 ways of positioning the second fermion,
yielding n  1 possible wave functions. we will enumerate such wave functions by the
subscript index k, as in f (n,2)
, where k = 2, 3, . . . , n. the subscript k denotes the location
of the second fermion. explicitly, we have

(4.14)
of course, depending upon the symmetry, the n  1 fock states enumerated in this way
need not be distinct with respect to the cyclic properties of the trace. this provides us
with additional relations between wave functions  a fact we will make use of later on.
now let us assume that |i is a normalizable su(n) zero mass eigenstate with at
most n partons. glancing at the form of (4.7), we see that the n + 1 parton fock states
containing a single fermion in each of the combinations q|(n,0)i and q|(n,2)i must
cancel each other to guarantee a massless eigenstate. this immediately gives rise to the
following wave function relation:

q1 + 2q2
q1 + q2

f (n,0)(q1 + q2, q3, . . . , qn+1) 

q1 + 2qn+1
q1 + qn+1

f (n,0)(qn+1 + q1, q2, . . . , qn) =

(q1, . . . , qk1, qk + qk+1, qk+2, . . . , qn+1).

(4.15)

in the limit qi  0, for 3  i  n, this last equation is reduced to

f (n,2)

(q1, . . . , qi1, qi+1, . . . , qn+1)

f (n,2)
i1 (q1, . . . , qi1, qi+1, . . . , qn+1) = 0.

(4.16)

an immediate consequence is that any wave function f (n,2)
expressed in terms of f (n,2)

. explicitly, we have

i

for i = 3, 4, . . . , n, may be

f (n,2)

(q1, q2, . . . , qn) = s qi

f (n,2)
2

(q1, q2, . . . , qn),

i = 3, 4, . . . , n.

(4.17)

moreover, the limit q2  0 of equation (4.15) yields the further relation after a suitable
change of variables:

f (n,0)(q1, q2, q3, . . . , qn) =

2

ns q1

q2

f (n,2)
2

(q1, q2, q3, . . . , qn).

(4.18)

finally, because of the cyclic properties of the trace, there is an additional relation
between wave functions:

f (n,2)
i

ni+2(qi, qi+1, . . . , qn, q1, q2, . . . , qi1).
setting i = 2 in the above equation, and i = n in equation (4.17), we deduce

(q1, q2, . . . , qi, . . . , qn) = f (n,2)

(4.19)

f (n,2)

(q1, q2, . . . , qn) = s q1

(q2, q3, . . . , qn, q1).

(4.20)

)f (n,0)(q1, . . . , qn) = 0, where
combining this with equation (4.18), we conclude (
we use the fact that the wave functions f (n,0) are cyclically symmetric. thus f (n,0) must
vanish. it immediately follows that f (n,2)

vanish for all i as well.

to summarize, we have shown that if |i is a normalizable zero mass eigenstate,
where each fock state in its fock state expansion has no more than n partons, the
contributions |(n,0)i and |(n,2)i in this fock state expansion must vanish. since we
may assume |i is bosonic, the only other contributions involve fock states with an even
|(n,4)i, |(n,6)i, and so on. we claim that all such contributions
number of fermions:
vanish. to see this, rst observe that the n + 1 parton fock states with three fermions in
the combinations q|(n,2)i and q|(n,4)i must cancel each other, in order to guarantee
a zero eigenstate mass. but our previous analysis demonstrated that |(n,2)i  0, and

34

thus the n + 1 parton fock states with three fermions in q|(n,4)i alone must sum to
zero.
we are now ready to perform an induction procedure. namely, we assume that for
some positive integer k the state |(n,2[k1])i vanishes. then the n + 1 parton fock states
in q|i which contain 2k  1 fermions receive contributions only from q|(n,2k)i in
which a fermion is replaced by two bosons. this has to sum to zero. we therefore obtain
a relation among the wave functions f (n,2k)
by considering the action of the supercharge
(4.7) in which a fermion is replaced by two bosons. keeping in mind that we are free to
renormalize any wave function by a constant, we end up with the following relation:

p

f (n,2k)
p

xp

(s1, . . . , si1, si + si+1, si+2, . . . , sn+1)

si+1  si

(si+1 + si)3/2 = 0.

(4.21)

it is now an easy task to show that the wave functions f (n,2k)
appearing in equation (4.21)
must vanish; one simply considers various limits sj  0 as we did before. this completes
our proof by induction. namely, there can be no non-trivial normalizable massless state
with an upper limit on the number of allowed partons. of course, this proof is valid only
in the large n limit. we now turn our attention to the nite n case.

p

let us dene qlead to be that part of the supercharge q that replaces a fermion
with two bosons, or replaces a boson with a boson and fermion pair. as in the large n
case we begin by assuming that we have a normalizable zero mass eigenstate |i which
is a sum of fock states that have at most n partons. the proof for nite n consists of
two parts. first, we consider bosonic states consisting of only n parton fock states that
have at most two fermions, and show the wave functions must vanish. we then invoke
an induction argument to consider n parton wave functions involving an even number of
fermions, and show they must vanish as well.

the additional complication introduced by the assumption that n is nite is that a
given fock state may involve more than just a single trace. however, note that qlead
cannot decrease the number of traces; it can either increase the number of traces by
one, or leave the number unchanged. thus we have a natural induction procedure in the
number of traces as well. since the terms in qlead have only one annihilation operator,
it acts on a given product of traces according to the leibniz rule:

qlead (tr[a]tr[b] . . .)|0i = (cid:16)qleadtr[a](cid:17) tr[b] . . .|0i +
(1)f (a)tr[a]qlead (tr[b] . . .)|0i.

(4.22)

schematically, the general structure of an arbitrary fock state with k traces has the form

f (n,i1,i2,...,ik)
p

tr[(b)i1a . . . a] . . . tr[(b)ik a . . . a]|0i,

(4.23)

where n denotes the total number of partons in each fock state, and the integers i1, i2, . . .
denote the number of fermions in the rst trace, second trace, and so on. we will always

35

order the traces so that the number of fermions in each trace decreases to the right. the
index p labels a particular arrangement of fermions.

we now consider the n + 1 parton fock states of qlead|i that have precisely one
fermion. the only possible contributions involve three types of wave functions; f (n,0),
f (n,2)
and f (n,1,1) (we only include the permutation index p if there is more than one
p
distinct arrangement). if these three wave functions contribute to the same one fermion
fock state, then the distribution of bosons in the fock state corresponding to f (n,2)
determines the distribution of bosons for f (n,0) and f (n,1,1). we allow qlead to act only
on the rst trace in both f (n,0) and f (n,2)
, and only on the second one in f (n,1,1). if there
are more than two traces in these states they must be identical in all the components,
and so dont play a role in the calculation. thus, it is sucient to consider states with
two traces only. such a state has the form

(qm+2 + qm+1)3/2 f (n+m,1,1)(p, q1 . . . qm|qm+1 + qm+2, qm+3 . . . qm+n) = 0,

(4.25)

where f is the contribution from f (n+m,0) and f (n+m,2)
. now we see that the limit
qm+1  0 gives: f (n+m,1,1)  0. thus if (4.24) represents a contribution to the massless

(4.26)

and qlead acts only on the terms in the square brackets. all these terms have only one
trace, which is a scenario we already encountered in the large n limit case. using the
results of that discussion, we nd that the only massless solution of the form (4.26) is
the trivial one. this is the starting point of the induction procedure for nite n.

as explained earlier, we look for n parton fock states in the expansion for |i that
have 2k fermions (k > 1), to nish the proof we need to show that for any k the only
allowed wave function is the trivial one. from the large n result we know there are no
such one trace states. we now consider the state with an arbitrary number of traces,

|(n,2k)i = xp z p +

then the analog of (4.21) for such states reads:

pi

f (n,2k)

(s1 . . .|sja . . . si1, si + si+1, si+2 . . . sja+ka| . . . sn+1)

here, pi means that for each trace we should include one additional term with i =

ja + ka, i + 1 = ja if c corresponding to both ja + ka and ja is a. if the number of
traces is a, we introduce

(si+1 + si)3/2 = 0.

if any of the blocks tr(. . .) in the state for which (4.28) is written contains two or
more fermions, then, as in the large n case, all the corresponding wave functions f (n,2k)
vanish. so we only need to consider the states of the form:

p

let q denote that part of the supercharge q which replaces a fermion with two bosons.
let us consider the result of such a change in the rst trace. suppose there are a traces
having the same form as the rst trace. then without loss of generality, we may assume
they are the rst a traces. then using the symmetries of the wave functions we nd:

if the above expression vanishes then the only solution is the trivial one in which all wave
functions vanish. this nishes the proof of the induction procedure for the nite n case.
the extension of the proof to massive bound states is straightforward. firstly, assume
|i is a normalizable eigenstate of 2p +p  with mass squared m 2 6= 0. then, since
p  = 12 (q)2, the state

| i  |i + q|i

(4.30)
for 2 = 2p +/m 2 is a normalizable eigenstate of the supercharge q, with eigenvalue
1/. we therefore study the eigen-problem q| i = 1
| i. the resulting constraints on
the wave functions may be obtained by modifying our original expressions by including a
wave function multiplied by a nite constant. however, in our analysis, we always need
to let some of the momenta vanish, and therefore this additional contribution vanishes.
the analysis (and therefore the conclusions) remains unchanged.

we therefore conclude that any normalizable su(n) bound state (massless or massive)

that exists in the model must be a superposition of an innite number of fock states.

4.3 higher dimensional theories.

in this subsection we extend our theorem to the twodimensional supersymmetric theories
obtained as the result of dimensional reduction from d > 3 dimensions. the most
important cases are d = 4, 6 and 10 which have 2, 4 and 8 supersymmetries in two
dimensions. below we consider only large n case, the generalization to arbitrary su(n)
group is trivial repetition of the arguments given in previous subsection.

38

again our starting point is the fact that if there is normalizable eigenstate of hamil-

tonian having nite length than its main symbol satises the condition:

qlead| >= 0,

(4.31)

where qlead is the part of supercharge increasing the number of partons. in three dimen-
sional case we had only one supercharge q, for general d dimensional sym reduced in
1 + 1 there are d  2 supercharges, each of them squared gives p  and (4.31) should
be true for all of them. in general dierent supercharges are not anticommute with each
other, but since we consider quantization near trivial classical conguration (with no
monopoles and no external charges) then they do. it is easy to derive the general form
of supercharge:

in the above expression we introduced d = d  2 kinds of bosons (i = 1, ..., d) and d
kinds of fermions ( = 1, ..., d) which we get as the result of compactication. the 
is nonzero constant depending on d and m are combinations of d dimensional dirac
matrices:

m 

ij = (it

j  jt

i ).

(4.34)

as before our proof is based on the induction on the number of fermionic operators
in the state. first we consider main symbol being superposition of purely bosonic states
and ones containing two fermionic operators. now we have d types of bosons and d types
of fermions so some additional indices should be included in the wavefunctions. dening
bosonic indexes to be capital letters a, b... and fermionic ones to be greek letters we
write:

|, 0 > = z p +

 tr[aa1(q1)...aak1(qk1)b1(qk)aak (qk+1)...aan2(qn1)b2(qn)]|0 > .

39

it is now easy to nd the one fermionic part of the result of action by (4.32) on the
main symbol of the state. the vanishing of this contribution leads to the generalization
of the equation (4.15):

(4.37)

this equation should be true for any possible a1...an ,  and . we will show that the
only solution of such system of equations is trivial one so all the f (0)
[...] vanish.
this will be proven by induction. first we note that if a1 = ... = an and  =  then
equation (4.37) is reduced to (4.15) written for f (0)
[a...aa...a] and as we saw
this leads to

[a...a] and f (2)k

[...] and f (2)k

(4.38)
for arbitrary a and . the next case to consider is a1 = ... = an,  6= . using relation
just found the (4.37) for this case again gives us (4.15), but this time correspondence
reads:

f (2)k
[a...aa...a] = 0

f (0)
[a...a] = 0,

f (0)  pm 
f (2)k  f (0)

abf (0)

[a...aa...a].

the proven property of (4.15) together with trivial identity

leads to

f (0)
[ba...a] = 0,

f (2)k
[a...aa...a] = 0

(4.39)

(4.40)

(4.41)

for any a, b, ,  (a could be equal to b and  to ). we use this equation as starting
point of the induction procedure.

let us introduce one useful function. for each set {a1...ak} we dene n({a1...ak})

to be the maximal number of identical a in the set:

n({a1...ak}) = max

id   k
xi=1

(ai  i)! .

(4.42)

40

in terms of this new function our result (4.41) can be rewritten as

f (0)
[a1...an] = 0

if

f (2)k
[a1...ak1ak...an2] = 0 if

n({a1...an})  n  1
n({a1...an}) = n  2.

(4.43)

this condition will be used as starting point of induction then the assumption of induction
procedure is:

f (0)
[a1...an] = 0
f (2)k
[a1...ak1ak...an2] = 0 if

n({a1...an})  m
if
n({a1...an})  m  1

(4.44)

and we checked it for m = n  1. in our induction procedure we will decrease parameter
m instead of increasing it. to perform the proof, we start with writing (4.37) for the set
{a1...ak} with n = m:
qk+1  qk
(qk+1 + qk)3/2 akak+1f (2)k

(4.45)

[a1...ak1ak+2...an]

if  =  then the right hand side is zero and we have a recurrent relations for f (2)k
with dierent k. due to the presence of  symbol these relations would connect only f (2)k
inside some clusters (for m < n) and the boundary elements of such clusters should be
zero. thus we deduce that if n({a1...an2}) = m  2 then

f (2)k
[a1...ak1ak...an2] = 0.
for  6=  we consider dierent limits qi  0 in (4.45):

for 1 < i < n. since n < n  1 then there exist i < n: aiai1 = 0 then from above
equations we deduce for  6= :
f (0)
[a1...an] = 0,
f (2)k
[a1...ak1ak...an2] = 0,

(4.49)

n({a1...an}) = m  1
n({a1...an}) = m  2.
41

this nishes the proof by induction. thus we have proven that equation (4.37) doesnt
have any normalizable solutions.

to show that there are no nite length bound states we now turn to the analog of

equation (4.21). this analog reads:

(4.50)

where pi describes dierent permutations of a and . this equation gives linear relations
between wavefunctions inside the block of a in

tr(...ba...ab...)|0 >,

(4.51)

boundary elements (when index i corresponds to fermions) vanish, so as in the case
3  2 all the f (2k) are zero. this completes the proof for general compactication.

4.4 bound states in dlcq.

in the previous subsection we proved that the continuum formulation of the theory does
not have any normalizable bound states with a nite number of partons. our proof
used the behavior of wave functions at small momenta arising from the normalizability
assumption. neither of these properties can be used in dlcq, however. here we consider
some simple examples of massless dlcq solutions with n bosons to help shed some light
on the relation between dlcq solutions and the solutions of the continuum theory. for
simplicity, we work in the large n limit case.

we write the momentum of a state in dlcq in terms of the momentum fraction qi
where qi = ri
r p +, and the ri are positive integers. the wave function of such a state
is f (n,0)(r1, . . . , rn). there are two conditions that must be satised to show that it is
massless. one is the that the coecient of the term with one additional fermion that is
produced by the action of q is zero. this condition gives the relation,

2rn + t
rn + t

f (n,0)(r1, . . . , rn1, rn + t) 

2rn1 + t
rn1 + t

f (n,0)(r1, . . . , rn1 + t, rn) = 0.

(4.52)

where t correspond to the momentum fraction of the one fermion. the second is that the
coecient of the state with two fewer bosons and one additional fermion which is also
produced by the action of q is zero. this condition gives the relation,

xk,t

t  2k
k(t  k)

f (n,0)(r1, . . . , rn2, k, t  k)(rn1+rn,t) = 0.

(4.53)

for the case where all ri = 1, and the total harmonic resolution is n, it is trivial
that eqn(4.52) is satised since there is not enough resolution to increase the number of

42

particles in the state. it is also easy to see from eqn (4.53) since the coecient of the
one term in the sum is zero. thus the wave function f (n,0)(1, 1, ....1) is a massless state
for every resolution

to discuss additional solutions it is useful to start by considering eqn(4.52). the case

t = 1, gives the equation

f (n,0)(r1, . . . , rn2, rn1, rn + 1) =

2rn1 + 1
2rn + 1

rn + 1
rn1 + 1

f (n,0)(r1, . . . , rn2, rn1 + 1, rn).

(4.54)
this equation is trivial to satisfy if ri = 1 for all i. the contributions in eqn(4.53) come
from the two terms in the sum, k = 1, t = 3 and k = 2, t = 3. each term has the
same coecient but of opposite sign and cancel. therefore the state f (n,0)(1, ...1, 2) is a
massless state for all resolutions

the next case t = 2 in eqn(4.52) gives,

f (n,0)(r1, . . . , rn2, rn1, rn + 2) =

2rn1 + 2
2rn + 2

rn + 2
rn1 + 2

f (n,0)(r1, . . . , rn2, rn1 + 2, rn).

(4.55)

using (4.54) twice we nd:

f (n,0)(r1...rn2, rn1, rn + 2) =
2rn1 + 3
2rn + 1

2rn1 + 1
2rn + 3

rn + 2
rn1 + 1

=

2rn1 + 1
2rn + 3
rn + 1
rn1 + 2

f (n.0)(r1...rn2, rn1 + 1, rn + 1) =

rn + 2
rn1 + 1
f (n,0)(r1...rn2, rn1 + 2, rn).

(4.56)

comparing with (4.55) we have:

f (n,0)(r1...rn2, rn1 + 2, rn) 

(rn + 1)2

(2rn + 3)(2rn + 1) 

(rn1 + 1)2

(2rn1 + 3)(2rn1 + 1)! = 0. (4.57)

using relation (4.52) several times we can always express an arbitrary wave function in
the following form:

f (n,0)(r1...rn) = c(r1...rn)f (n,0)(1...1, l + 1, 1)

(4.58)

where l = r1 + ... + rn  n and c(r1...rn) is some nonzero coecient.the two massless
states we found above correspond to l = 0 and l = 1. choosing r1 = ... = rn2 = rn = 1
in (4.57) we nd,

f (n,0)(1...1, (l  1) + 2, 1) = 0

f or l > 2

(4.59)

due to monotonic behavior of the function in the parenthesis. then using (4.58) we
conclude that all the wave functions with l > 2 vanish. so the only case we need
consider is l = 2. in this case (4.52) has only two nontrivial cases: t = 1 and t = 2
which are given by (4.54) and (4.55). in the second of these equations we can only have

43

r1 = . . . = rn = 1 so it is trivially satised. equation (4.54) however gives a nontrivial
relation for the wave function:

f (n,0)(1, . . . , 1, 2, 2) = f (n,0)(1, . . . , 2, 1, 2) = . . . =

f (n,0)(2, . . . , 1, 1, 2) =

10
9

f (n,0)(1, . . . , 1, 3).

(4.60)

nally we must show that eqn(4.53) is satised which is straight forward.

these are only a few examples of massless states, and there are in fact many more
in dlcq [5]. but the results of our numerical analysis show that the states we just
described are closely connected with the massless states in the continuum. let us for-
mulate this relation for n = . in this case only single trace states should be kept in
the spectrum and dlcq massless states have the following structure. the state rst
appear as tr(a(1) . . . a(1)) at resolution p , then one can trace it to resolutions p + 1
and p + 2 as states with wavefunctions (4.59) and (4.60). as we just proved at higher
resolutions there are no massless states containing exactly k partons, however at any
resolution k  p there is exactly one massless state whose wavefunction is localized pre-
dominantly in the sector with p partons a. so it is natural to collect all such states in
the single sequence and to call the limits of this sequence continuum massless state with
p bosons, although as we saw the wavefunction of continuum state has contributions
from sectors with dierent number of partons. the interesting feature of this theory is
that such continuum massless states with p bosons are the only bosonic massless states
seen by dlcq (in principle the theory in the continuum might have massless state whose
wavefunction is localized in sector with innite number of partons, but we will ignore
this possibility). thus one can easily count bosonic massless states at any resolution p :
they are just images of states with p bosons for all p  k, thus there are k  1 such
states. acting on any of such states by q+ we can get the fermionic massless state (then
there are also k  1 of them), while acting by q doesnt give any new state (the result
is zero). we will do the counting for nite n case in the next subsection.
in the continuum limit we have proven that there are no massless normalizable states
with a nite number of particles. however, at each nite value of the harmonic resolution,
one obtains an exactly massless bound state, but as the harmonic resolution is sent to
innity, the number of fock states required to keep the bound state massless must also
be innite.

4.5 counting of massless states in dlcq.

finally in this section we will count the massless states in dlcq as function of resolution,
keeping the number of colors n nite. however we will assume that n is not too small,
so that the relation between n and resolution k: k < n 2  1 is satised. we will need
this condition in order to insure all states of the form tr(c . . . c) . . . tr(c . . . c)|0i are
linearly independent unless they are related by either cyclic permutations in one of the
traces or permutations of traces themselves. the simplest example of violation of this

44

condition is the state

tr(a(1)a(1)a(1))|0i = 0

for su(2) (here 3 = 4  1). although for k > n 2  1 some conclusions can be made,
the dierent n and k requires special consideration and we are not going to proceed in
this direction. from the numerical perspective we should mention that in our calculation
k < 11, so the only excluded values of n are 2 and 3.

as soon as the condition k < n 2  1 is satised the dlcq fock spaces for su(n)
and su() are the same if all multitrace states are taken into account. moreover our
numerical analysis strongly suggests that the number of massless states is the same for all
n > k + 1, while wavefunctions depend on n. however talking about su() fock

space one usually considers only single trace states as fundamental ones, while multitrace
states are though of as the system of free bound states. let us explain the reason for
this. the lightcone hamiltonian can be written in the following schematic form:

p =

1
n

p  = cijcij +

1
n

cij(ccc)ij +

1
n

(cc)ij(cc)ij +

1
n

(ccc)ij(c)ij.

(4.61)

the 1
n is introduced in order to make the eigenvalues of p nite as n  . let us
consider two eigenstates of p, which are chosen to be combination of single traces in the
large n limit:

pa|0i = maa|0i,
pb|0i = mab|0i.

this is equivalent to the following commutation relations:

[p, a] = maa +

hp, bi = mbb +

1

n x antr(c . . . cc) +
n x bntr(c . . . cc) +

1

1

n 2(cid:19) ,
n x atr(c . . . ccc) + o(cid:18) 1
n 2(cid:19) .
n x bntr(c . . . ccc) + o(cid:18) 1

1

we introduced a convenient notation for the normalized trace here:

(4.62)
(4.63)

(4.64)

(4.65)

ntr(c . . . cc . . . c

) =

|

n

{z

}

1
n n/2 (c . . . c)ij(c . . . c)ij.

this way the state ntr(c . . . c)|0i has a nite norm in the large n limit. from the
equations (4.64) one can easily see that

pab|0i = (ma + mb)ab|0i + o(cid:18) 1
n(cid:19) ,

(4.66)

i.e. we indeed have a combination of two free states in the large n limit. in particular
this fact may be applied toward the classication of dlcq massless states at n = :

45

the multitrace state is massless if and only if all of the traces involved correspond to
massless states. we also mention the trivial fact that if state a has resolution ka and
b has kb then ab is the state at resolution ka + kb.

let us summarize what we have learned so far. the number of massless states in
su(n) theory at resolution k < n 2  1 is the same as one for su() theory if the
multitrace states are included in the latter. on the other hand due to the fact that
multitrace massless states in su() have special structure (namely any single trace in
them is massless state itself), their number can be calculated from the known number of
massless states written as linear combination of single traces. the remaining part of this
subsection is devoted to such calculation.

as we found in the end of the last subsection there are 2(k  1) single trace massless
states at resolution k. we will show how this information can be used in order to count
the total number of massless states. let us introduce some notation rst. the value we
want to calculate is nk  the number of massless states at resolution k. we also dene
n (m)
as number of such massless states at resolution k that the resolution of any single
traces in them is greater or equal to m. then for example nk = n (2)
k = 2(k1).
finally we dene fn(m) to be the number of dierent massless states containing n traces,
each of which corresponds has resolution equal to m. then one can derive the recurrent
relation:

k and n (k)

k

n (m)

k = n (m+1)

k

+

[k/m]

xn=1

fn(m)(cid:16)n (m+1)

kmn + k

mn(cid:17) .

(4.67)

k = 2(k  1) and
k = 0 for m > k. in order to apply (4.67) we only have to evaluate fn(m). this will

the starting point of the recurrent procedure are the relations n (k)
n (m)
be our next task.

to calculate fn(m) we rst assume that we have only bosonic traces at our disposal.
let us count the states which contain p such traces. after combining identical traces
together one can reduce the problem further by considering only states with special trace
structure. namely we will concentrate our attention on the massless states having ni
traces of type i, for dierent values of i = 1 . . . r. without the loss of generality we can

require n1  . . .  nr  1, one can also see that the relation p ni = p holds. if all ni

are dierent then the number of massless states with xed structure is given by simple
formula:

g(m) (g(m)  1) . . . (g(m)  r + 1) ,

where g(m) = m 1 is the number of bosonic single trace massless states. in general one
gets additional combinatoric coecient c(n1, . . . , nr) in the last expression, it is dened
by the following rules:

c(n1, . . . , ni, ni+1, . . . , nr) = c(n1, . . . , ni)c(ni+1, . . . , nr),

if ni > ni+1,

1
a!

.

c(n, . . . , n

) =

{z

}

46

(4.68)

now let us include fermionic traces in the picture. the only dierence between them and
bosons is the pauli principle, so considering the product of q fermionic traces one has to
choose all of them to be dierent. thus the coecient c for this case is

cf (q) = c(1, . . . , 1

) =

1
q!

.

collecting all the information together we nally get:

fn(m) =

. this in turn leads to the results for nk = n (2)

now we can use the relations (4.70), (4.71) and (4.68) to determine all the coecients
fn(m) and then substituting them to the recurrent relation (4.67) one can nd all the
n (m)
k . although we were not able to nd
an analytic expression for nk as function of k, the number of states can be evaluated
numerically for arbitrary k using the procedure we just described. we performed such
calculations using mathematica and the results for lowest resolutions are summarized in
the table1. for instance one can see that up to resolution 5 nk = 2k1, but at higher
resolutions this relations holds only approximately.

5 correlation functions in sym and dlcq.

the bound state problem we have studied so far is the traditional one for dlcq. how-
ever this is not the only calculation that can be done using this method. the problem
of computing of correlation functions, more traditional for conventional quantum eld
theory, can also be addressed in the light cone quantization. unlike the usual methods of
qft the results of dlcq calculations are valid beyond the perturbation theory and thus
they can be used for the testing the duality between the gauge theory and supergravity.
there has been a great deal of excitement during this past year following the re-
alization that certain eld theories admit concrete realizations as a string theory on a

47

particular background [61]. by now many examples of this type of correspondence for
eld theories in various dimensions with various eld contents have been reported in the
literature (for a comprehensive review and list of references, see [2]). however, attempts
to apply these correspondences to study the details of these theories have only met with
limited success so far. the problem stems from the fact that our understanding of both
sides of the correspondence is limited. on the eld theory side, most of what we know
comes from perturbation theory where we assume that the coupling is weak. on the string
theory side, most of what we know comes from the supergravity approximation where
the curvature is small. there are no known situations where both approximations are
simultaneously valid. at the present time, comparisons between the dual gauge/string
theories have been restricted to either qualitative issues or quantities constrained by
symmetry. any improvement in our understanding of eld theories beyond perturbation
theory or string theories beyond the supergravity approximation is therefore a welcome
development.

we will study the eld theory/string theory correspondence motivated by considering
the near-horizon decoupling limit of a d1-brane in type iib string theory [50]. the gauge
theory corresponding to this theory is the yang-mills theory in two dimensions with 16
supercharges. its sdlcq formulation was recently reported in [9]. this is probably the
simplest known example of a eld theory/string theory correspondence involving a eld
theory in two dimensions with a concrete lagrangian formulation.

a convenient quantity that can be computed on both sides of the correspondence
is the correlation function of gauge invariant operators [41, 83]. we will focus on two
point functions of the stress-energy tensor. this turns out to be a very convenient
quantity to compute for many reasons that we will explain along the way. some aspects
of this as it pertains to a consideration of black hole entropy was recently discussed in
[42]. there are other physical quantities often reported in the literature. in the dlcq
literature, the spectrum of hadrons is often reported. this would be ne for theories in a
conning phase. however, we expect the sym in two dimension to ow to a non-trivial
conformal xed point in the infra-red [50, 31]. the spectrum of states will therefore
form a continuum and will be cumbersome to handle. on the string theory side, entropy
density [24] and the quark anti-quark potential [24, 73, 62] are frequently reported. the
denition of entropy density requires that we place the eld theory in a space-like box
which seems incommensurate with the discretized light cone. similarly, a static quark
anti-quark conguration does not t very well inside a discretized light-cone geometry.
the correlation function of point-like operators do not suer from these problems. we
should mention that there exists interesting work on computing the qcd string tension
[15, 16] directly in the eld theory. these authors nd that the qcd string tension
vanishes in the supersymmetric theories which is consistent with the power law quark
anti-quark potential found on the supergravity side. this section is based on the results
of paper [4].

5.1 correlation functions from supergravity

let us begin by reviewing the computation of the correlation function of stress energy
tensors on the string theory side using the supergravity approximation. the computation
is essentially a generalization of [41, 83]. the main conclusion on the supergravity side
was reported recently in [42] but we will elaborate further on the details. the near
horizon geometry of a d1-brane in string frame takes the form

(5.1)

in order to compute the two point function, we need to know the action for the diagonal
uctuations around this background to the quadratic order. what we need is an analogue
of [54] for this background which unfortunately is not currently available in the literature.
fortunately, some diagonal uctuating degrees of freedom can be identied by following
the early work on black hole absorption cross-subsections [56, 40]. in particular, we can
show that the uctuations parameterized according to

ds2 = (cid:16)1 + f (x0, u) + g(x0, u)(cid:17) g00(dx0)2 +(cid:16)1 + 5f (x0, u) + g(x0, u)(cid:17) g11(dx1)2

(5.3)

by direct substitution into the equations of motion in 10 dimensions. we have assumed
without loss of generality that these uctuation vary only along the x0 direction of the
world volume coordinates like a plane wave eikx0. the elds f (u) and g(u) are scalars
when the d1-brane is viewed as a black hole in 9 dimensions; in fact there are the min-
imal and the xed scalars in this black hole geometry. in 10 dimensions, however, we
see that they are really part of the gravitational uctuation. we expect therefore that
they are associated with the stress-energy tensor in the operator eld correspondence of
[41, 83]. in the case of the correspondence between n = 4 sym and ads5  s5, super-
conformal invariance allowed the identication of operators and elds in short multiplets
[34]. for the d1-brane, we do not have superconformal invariance and this technique is
not applicable. in fact, we expect all elds of the theory consistent with the symmetry

49

of a given operator to mix. the large distance behavior should then be dominated by
the contribution with the longest range. the eld f (k0, u) appears to be the one with
the longest range since it is the lightest eld.

the equation (5.3) for f (u) can be solved explicitly in terms of the bessels function

f (u) = u3k3/2(q163g2

y m n u2k).

(5.4)

by thinking of f (u) in direct analogy with the minimally coupled scalar as was done in
[41, 83], we can compute the ux factor

up to a numerical coecient of order one which we have suppressed. we see that the
leading non-analytic (in k2) contribution is due to the k3 term, whose fourier transform
scales according to7

ho(x)o(0)i =

gy m x5 .

(5.6)

this result passes the following important consistency test. the sym in 2 dimensions
with 16 supercharges have conformal xed points in both uv and ir with central charges
of order n 2 and n, respectively. therefore, we expect the two point function of stress
energy tensors to scale like n 2/x4 and n/x4 in the deep uv and ir, respectively. ac-
cording to the analysis of [50], we expect to deviate from these conformal behavior and
cross over to a regime where supergravity calculation can be trusted. the cross over
occurs at x = 1/gy mn and x = n /gy m . at these points, the n scaling of (5.6) and
the conformal result match in the sense of the correspondence principle [49].

5.2 correlation functions from dlcq

the challenge then is to attempt to reproduce the scaling relation (5.6), x the numerical
coecient, and determine the detail of the cross-over behavior using sdlcq. ever since
the original proposal [32], the question of equivalence between quantizing on a light-cone
and on a space-like slice have been discussed extensively. this question is especially
critical whenever a massless particle or a zero-mode in the quantization is present. it is
generally believed that the massless theories can be described on the light-cone as long
as we take m  0 as a limit. the issue of zero mode have been examined by many
authors. some recent accounts can be found in [45, 26, 14, 10, 85]. generally speaking,
supersymmetry seems to save sdlcq from complicated zero-mode issues. we will not
contribute much to these discussions. instead, we will formulate the computation of the
correlation function of stress energy tensor in naive dlcq. to check that these results
are sensible, we will rst do the computation for the free fermions. extension to sym

7it is not dicult to show that for a generic p-brane, ho(x)o(0)i = n

with 16 supercharges will be essentially straightforward, except for one caveat. in order
to actually evaluate the correlation functions, we must resort to numerical analysis at the
last stage of the computation. for the sym with 16 supercharges, this problem grows
too big too fast to be practical on desk top computer where the current calculations were
performed. we can only provide an algorithm, which, when executed on an much more
powerful computer, should reproduce (5.6). nonetheless, the fact that we can dene a
concrete algorithm seems to be a progress in the right direction. one potential pit-fall
is the fact that the computation may not show any sign of convergence. if this is the
case, or if it converges to a result at odds with (5.6), we must go back and re-examine
the issue of equivalence of forms and the issue of zero modes.

the technique of dlcq is reviewed by many authors [25, 30] so we will be brief here.
the basic idea of light-cone quantization is to parameterize the space using light cone
coordinates x+ and x and to quantize the theory making x+ play the role of time. in the
discrete light cone approach, we require the momentum p = p+ along the x direction
to take on discrete values in units of p+/k where p+ is the conserved total momentum
of the system and k is an integer commonly referred to as the harmonic resolution. one
can think of this discretization as a consequence of compactifying the x coordinate on a
circle with a period 2l = 2k/p+. the advantage of discretizing the light cone is the fact
that the dimension of the hilbert space becomes nite. therefore, the hamiltonian is a
nite dimensional matrix and its dynamics can be solved explicitly. in sdlcq one makes
the dlcq approximation to the supercharges and these discrete representations satisfy
the supersymmetry algebra. therefore sdlcq enjoys the improved renormalization
properties of supersymmetric theories. of course, to recover the continuum result, we
must send k to innity and as luck would have it, we nd that sdlcq usually converges
faster than the naive dlcq. of course, in the process, the size of the matrices will grow,
making the computation harder and harder.

let us now return to the problem at hand. we would like to compute a general

expression of the form

f (x, x+) = ho(x, x+)o(0, 0)i .

(5.7)

in dlcq, where we x the total momentum in the x direction, it is more natural to
compute its fourier transform

1
2lho(p, x+)o(p, 0)i .
this can naturally be expressed in a spectrally decomposed form

f (p, x+) =

5.3 correlator for free dirac fermions

let us rst consider evaluating this expression for the stress-energy tensor in the theory
of free dirac fermions as a simple example. the lagrangian for this theory is

l = i /   m 

(5.10)

where for concreteness, we take 0 = 2, 1 = i1 and we take  = 21/4( 
of the spinor components, the lagrangian takes the form

 ). in terms

l = i+ + i 

im

(  ) .

(5.11)

since we treat x+ as time and since  does not have any derivatives with respect to x+ in
the lagrangian, it can be eliminated from the equation of motion, leaving a lagrangian
which depends only on :

l = i+ + i

operators b(n) and d(n) with positive and negative n are interpreted as a destruction
and creation operators, respectively. in a theory with only fermions, it is customary to
take anti-periodic boundary condition in order to avoid zero-mode issues. therefore, n
will take on half-integer values8. they satisfy the anticommutation relation

{b(n), b(m)} = {d(n), d(m)} = n,m .

which is the fourier transform of the local expression for p with the total derivative
contribution adjusted to make this operator hermitian. therefore, this should be thought
of as the t ++ component of the stress energy tensor. for reasons that will become clear
as we go on, this turns out to be one of the simplest things to compute. when acted on
the vacuum, this operator creates a state

t ++(k)|0i =



l  k

since the fermions in this theory are free, the plane wave states

|ni = b(k + n)d(n)|0i

which is simply the discretized version of the spectrum of a two body continuum. all
that we have to do now is calculate eigenstates of the actual theory we are interested in
and to assemble these pieces into (5.9), but we can do a little more to make the result
more presentable. the point is that since (5.9) is expressed in mixed momentum/position
space notation in minkowski space, the answer is inherently a complex quantity that is
cumbersome to display. for the computation of two point function, however, we can go
to position space by fourier transforming with respect to the l variable. after fourier
transforming, it is straight forward to euclideanize and display the two point function
as a purely real function without loosing any information. to see how this works, let us
write (5.9) in the form

f (p, x+) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

the quantity inside the absolute value sign is designed to be independent of l. now, to
recover the position space form of the correlation function, we inverse fourier transform
with respect to p = k/l.

the integral over l can be done explicitly and gives

f (x, x+) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

5.4 correlator for supersymmetric yang-mills theory with 16

supercharges.

finally, let us turn to the problem of computing the two point function of the t ++ op-
erator for the sym with 16 supercharges. adopting light-cone coordinates and choosing
the light-cone gauge will eliminate the gauge boson and half of the fermion degrees of
freedom. the most signicant change comes from the fact that the elds in this the-
ory are in the adjoint rather than the fundamental representations and the theory is
supersymmetric. this does not cause any fundamental problem in the dlcq formu-
lation of these theories.
indeed, the sdlcq formulation of this [9] as well as many
other related models with adjoint elds have been studied in the literature. the main
diculty comes from the fact that in supersymmetric theories low mass states such as
tr[b(n1)b(n2)b(k +n1 +n2)]|0i with an arbitrary number of excited quanta, or bits,
appear in the spectrum. this means that for a given harmonic resolution k, the dimen-
sion of the hilbert space grows like exp(k), which is roughly the number of ways to
partition k into sums of integers.

the fact that the size of the problem grows very fast is somewhat discouraging from a
numerical perspective. nevertheless, it is interesting to note that dlcq provides a well
dened algorithm for computing a physical quantity like the two point function of t ++
that can be compared with the prediction from supergravity. in the following, we will
show that this can be computed for the sym theory by a straight forward application of
(5.23).

as we found in section 1 the momentum operator p + is given by

(iuu  i(u)u)(cid:21) ,

(5.27)
where x and u are the physical adjoint scalars and fermions respectively, following the
notation of [9]. when discretized, these operators have the mode expansion

therefore, (l/)h0|t ++(k)|ni is independent of l and can be substituted directly into
(5.23) to give an explicit expression for the two point function.
we see immediately that (5.29) has the correct small r behavior, for in that limit,

(5.29) asymptotes to (assuming nb = nf )

which is what we expect for the theory of nb free bosons and nf free fermions in the

large k limit.

computing this quantity beyond the small r asymptotics, however, represents a
formidable technical challenge.
in [9] we constructed the mass matrix explicitly and
compute the spectrum for k = 2, k = 3, and k = 4. even for these modest values of
the harmonic resolution, the dimension of the hilbert space was as big as 256, 1632, and
29056 respectively (the symmetries of the theory can be used to reduce the size of the
calculation somewhat). in gure 3, we display the results with the currently available
values of k, except for the fact that we display the correlation function multiplied by a
factor of 42r4/n 2(2nb + nf ), so that it now asymptotes to 1 (or 0 in the logarithmic

in this way any deviation from the asymptotic behavior
1/r4 is made more transparent. note that with the values of the harmonic resolution k
obtained at present, the spectrum in gure 3.a is far from resembling a dense continuum
near m = 0. clearly, we must probe much higher values of k before we can sensibly
compare our eld theory results with the prediction from supergravity.

5.5 supersymmetric yang-mills theories with less than 16

supercharges

the computation of the correlator for the stress energy tensor in the (8,8) model is limited
by our inability to carry out the computation for large enough harmonic resolution. it is
the (8,8) model which we are ultimately interested in solving in order to compare against
the prediction of maldacenas conjecture in the supergravity limit. nevertheless, the
computation of the correlation function can just as well be applied to models with less
supersymmetry. we will conclude by reporting the results of such a computation.

first, let us consider the theory with supercharges (1,1). this theory is argued not to
exhibit dynamical supersymmetry breaking in [60, 67]. we can also provide a physicists
proof that supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken for this theory by adopting the
argument of witten for the 2+1 dimensional sym with chern-simons interaction [84].
in [84], the index of 2+1 dimensional sym with gauge group su(n) and 2 supercharges
on r  t 2 was computed and was found to be non-vanishing for chern-simons coupling
k3 > n/2. if the period l of one of the circles in t 2 is suciently small, this theory
is approximately the 2-dimensional sym with (1,1) supersymmetry with gauge coupling

theory is that of pure sym with (1,1) supersymmetry and a vanishing bf coupling.
choosing dierent values of k3 corresponds to a dierent choice in the path of approach
to this limit.
if we chose k3 > n/2, we are guaranteed to have a non-zero index for
nite l. this means that there will be a state with zero mass in the l  0 limit also,
indicating that supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken in this limit. on the other
hand, the index is not a well dened quantity in the l  0 limit, as a dierent choice of
k3 will lead to a dierent value of the index in the l  0 limit. in fact, the index can be
made arbitrarily large by taking k3 to be also arbitrarily large. this suggests that there
are innitely many states forming a continuum near m = 0. the index is therefore an ill
dened quantity, akin to counting the number of exactly zero energy states on a periodic
box as one takes the volume to innity.

this theory is also believed not to be conning [15, 16] and is therefore expected to

exhibit non-trivial infra-red dynamics.

the sdlcq of the 1+1 dimensional model with (1,1) supersymmetry was solved in
[64, 6], and we apply these results directly in order to compute (5.23). for simplicity, we
work to leading order in the large n expansion. the spectrum of this theory for various
values of k, and the subsequent computation of (5.23) is illustrated in gure 4.a.

the spectrum of this theory at nite k, illustrated in gure 4.a, consists of 2k  2
exactly massless states9, accompanied by large numbers of massive states separated by
a gap. the gap appears to be closing in the limit of large k however. we have tried
extrapolating the mass of the lightest massive state as a function of 1/k by performing a
least square t to a line and a parabola, giving the extrapolated value of m 2/g2
y m n =
1.7 and m 2/g2
y m n = 0.6, suggesting indeed that at large k, the gap is closed. this
is consistent with the expectation that the spectrum is that of a continuum starting at

9 i.e. k  1 massless bosons, and their superpartners.

in the computation of the correlation function illustrated in gure 4.b, we nd a

we have computed this quantity as a function of 1/k and extrapolated to 1/k  0 by
tting a line and a parabola to the computed values for nite 1/k. the result of this
extrapolation is illustrated in gure 5. the data currently available suggests that the
non-zero contribution from these massless states persists in the large k limit.

let us now turn to the model with (2,2) supersymmetry. the sdlcq version of this
model was solved in [11]. the result of this computation can be applied to (5.23). the
result is summarized in gure 6. this model appears to exhibit the onset of a gapless
continuum of states more rapidly than the (1,1) model as the harmonic resolution k is
increased. just as we found in the (1,1) model, this theory contains exactly massless
states in the spectrum. these massless states appear to couple to t ++|0i only for k
even, and the overlap appears to be decreasing as k is increased. we believe that this
model is likely to exhibit a power law behavior c/r for  > 4 for the t ++ correlator for
r  gy mn in the large n limit. unfortunately, the existing numerical data do not

permit the reliable computation of the exponent .

bound states of three dimensional supersym-

metric theory.

recently, there has been considerable progress in understanding the properties of strongly
coupled gauge theories with supersymmetry [75, 74]. in particular, there are a number
of supersymmetric gauge theories that are believed to be inter-connected through a web
of strong-weak coupling dualities. although these dualities provide a deep insight into
the dynamics of gauge theory at strong and weak couplings, they do not usually give
much information about the spectrum of bound states at intermediate values of coupling
constant g. the prominent exception is so called bps states whose mass is protected by
supersymmetry and thus stays the same for all values of g. an interesting new possibility
for analytical treatment of bound state problem in symd is based on the duality between
sym and supergravity proposed by maldacena [61] as discussed in the previous section.
this idea was also exploited in [28] to get the glueball spectrum of three dimensional
theory and the results agree with lattice calculations.

however it would be interesting to solve the bound state problem for sym theory
directly, starting from the rst principles of quantum eld theory. as we have seen in
the previous sections the solution can be found for the various two dimensional theories
by means of applying discrete light cone quantization. evidently, it would be desirable
to extend these dlcq/sdlcq algorithms to solve higher dimensional theories. one
important dierence between two dimensional and higher dimensional theories is the
phase diagram induced by variations in the gauge coupling. the spectrum of a 1 + 1
dimensional gauge theory scales trivially with respect to the gauge coupling, while a
theory in higher dimensions has the potential of exhibiting a complex phase structure,
which may include a strong-weak coupling duality. it is therefore interesting to study
the phase diagram of gauge theories in d  3 dimensions.
towards this end, we consider three dimensional su(n) n = 1 super-yang-mills
compactied on the space-time r  s1  s1.
in particular, we compactify the light-
cone coordinate x on a light-like circle via dlcq, and wrap the remaining transverse
coordinate x on a spatial circle. by retaining only the rst few excited modes in the
transverse direction, we are able to solve for bound state wave functions and masses
numerically by diagonalizing the discretized light-cone supercharge. we show that the
supersymmetric formulation of the dlcq procedure  which was studied in the context
of two dimensional theories extends naturally in 2 + 1 dimensions, resulting in an exactly
supersymmetric spectrum.

6.1 light-cone quantization and sdlcq
we wish to study the bound states of n = 1 super-yang-mills in 2 + 1 dimensions. any
numerical approach necessarily involves introducing a momentum lattice  i.e. parton
momenta can only take on discretized values. the usual spacetime lattice explicitly
breaks supersymmetry, so if we wish to discretize our theory and preserve supersymmetry,

60

then a judicious choice of lattice is required.

in 1 + 1 dimensions, it is well known that the light-cone momentum lattice induced
by the dlcq procedure preserves supersymmetry if the supercharge rather than the
hamiltonian is discretized [64, 7]. in 2 + 1 dimensions, a supersymmetric prescription is

also possible. we begin by introducing light-cone coordinates x = (x0  x1)/2, and

compactifying the x coordinate on a light-like circle. in this way, the conjugate light-
cone momentum k+ is discretized. to discretize the remaining (transverse) momentum
k = k2, we may compactify x = x2 on a spatial circle. of course, there is a signicant
dierence between the discretized light-cone momenta k+, and discretized transverse
momenta k; namely, the light-cone momentum k+ is always positive10, while k may
take on positive or negative values. the positivity of k+ is a key property that is exploited
in dlcq calculations; for any given light-cone compactication, there are only a nite
number of choices for k+  the total number depending on how nely we discretize the
momenta11. in the context of two dimensional theories, this implies a nite number of
fock states [68].

in the case we are interested in  in which there is an additional transverse dimension 
the number of fock states is no longer nite, since there are an arbitrarily large number of
transverse momentum modes dened on the transverse spatial circle. thus, an additional
truncation of the transverse momentum modes is required to render the total number of
fock states nite, and the problem numerically tractable12. in this work, we choose the
simplest truncation procedure beyond retaining the zero mode; namely, only partons with
transverse momentum k = 0, 2
l will be allowed, where l is the size of the transverse
circle.

let us now apply these ideas in the context of a specic super-yang-mills theory. we
start with 2 + 1 dimensional n = 1 super-yang-mills theory dened on a space-time with
one transverse dimension compactied on a circle:

s =z d2xz l

10since we wish to consider the decompactied limit in the end, we omit zero modes. this is a

necessary technical constraint in numerical calculations.

11the resolution of the discretization is usually characterized by a positive integer k, which is called
the harmonic resolution [68, 63]; for a given choice of k, the light-cone momenta k+ are restricted to
positive integer multiples of p +/k, where p + is the total light-cone momentum of a state

12 this truncation procedure, which is characterized by some integer upper bound, is analogous to the

truncation of k+ imposed by the harmonic resolution k.

using these relations one can check the supersymmetry algebra:

{q+, q} = 4p.

(6.12)

we will consider only states which have vanishing transverse momentum, which is
possible since the total transverse momentum operator is kinematical13. on such states,

13strictly speaking, on a transverse cylinder, there are separate sectors with total transverse momenta

2n/l; we consider only one of them, n = 0.

62

the light-cone supercharges q+ and q anti-commute with each other, and the super-
symmetry algebra is equivalent to the n = (1, 1) supersymmetry of the dimensionally
reduced (i.e. two dimensional) theory [64]. moreover, in the p = 0 sector, the mass
squared operator m 2 is given by m 2 = 2p +p .

as we mentioned earlier, in order to render the bound state equations numerically
tractable, the transverse momentum of partons must be truncated. first, we introduce
the fourier expansion for the elds  and , where the transverse space-time coordinate
x is periodically identied:

we now perform the truncation procedure; namely, in all sums over the transverse mo-
menta ni appearing in the above expressions for the supercharges, we restrict summation
to the following allowed momentum modes: ni = 0,1. more generally, the truncation
procedure may be dened by |ni |  nmax, where nmax is some positive integer. in this
work, we consider the simple case nmax = 1. note that this prescription is symmetric,
in the sense that there are as many positive modes as there are negative ones. in this
way we retain parity symmetry in the transverse direction.

how does such a truncation aect the supersymmetry properties of the theory? note
rst that an operator relation [a, b] = c in the full theory is not expected to hold in
the truncated formulation. however, if a is quadratic in terms of elds (or in terms of
creation and annihilation operators), one can show that the relation [a, b] = c implies

[atr, btr] = ctr

tr, q+

tr and {q+

tr} = 22p +

for the truncated operators atr,btr, and ctr. in our case, q+ is quadratic, and so the
relations {q+
tr, qtr} = 0 are true in the p = 0 sector of the
truncated theory. the {qtr, qtr} however is not equal to 22p tr . so the diagonalization
of {qtr, qtr} will yield a dierent bound state spectrum than the one obtained after
diagonalizing 22p tr . of course the two spectra should agree in the limit nmax  .
at any nite truncation, however, we have the liberty to diagonalize any one of these
operators. this choice species our regularization scheme.

choosing to diagonalize the light-cone supercharge, however, has an important ad-
vantage: the spectrum is exactly supersymmetric for any truncation.
in contrast, the
spectrum of the hamiltonian becomes supersymmetric only in the nmax   limit14.
to summarize, we have introduced a truncation procedure that facilitates a numer-
ical study of the bound state problem, and preserves supersymmetry. the interesting
property of the light-cone supercharge q [eqn(6.16)] is the presence of a gauge coupling
constant as an independent variable, which does not appear in the study of two dimen-
sional theories.
in the next subsection, we will study how variations in this coupling
aects the bound states in the theory.

6.2 numerical results: bound state solutions

in order to implement the dlcq formulation of the bound state problem  which is
tantamount to imposing periodic boundary conditions x = x + 2r [63]  we simply
restrict the light-cone momentum variables ki appearing in the expressions for q+ and

q to the following discretized set of momenta: n 1

denotes the total light-cone momentum of a state, and may be thought of as a xed
constant, since it is easy to form a fock basis that is already diagonal with respect to the
operator p + [68]. the integer k is called the harmonic resolution, and 1/k measures

choice; one can only diagonalize the light-cone hamiltonian. see [29] for more details on this approach.

the coarseness of our discretization. the continuum limit is then recovered by taking
the limit k  . physically, 1/k represents the smallest positive unit of longitudinal
momentum-fraction allowed for each parton in a fock state.

boson and fermion masses are identical.

of course, as soon as we implement the dlcq procedure, which is specied unam-
biguously by the harmonic resolution k, and cut-o transverse momentum modes via
the constraint |ni |  nmax, the integrals appearing in the denitions for q+ and q
are replaced by nite sums, and so the eigen-equation 2p +p |i = m 2|i is reduced
to a nite matrix diagonalization problem. in this last step we use the fact that p  is
proportional to the square of the light-cone supercharge15 q. in the present work, we
are able to perform numerical diagonalizations for k = 2, 3, 4 and 5 with the help of
mathematica and a desktop pc. in figure 7, we plot the bound state mass squared m 2,
in units 162n/l2, as a function of the dimensionless coupling g = gnl/43/2, in the
range 0  g  2. we consider the specic case n = 1000, although our algorithm can
calculate masses for any choice of n, since it enters our calculations as an algebraic vari-
able. since there is an exact boson-fermion mass degeneracy, one needs only diagonalize
the mass matrix m 2 corresponding to the bosons. for k = 5, there are precisely 600
bosons and 600 fermions in the truncated light-cone fock space, so the mass matrix that

92 fermions, while at k = 3, one nds 16 bosons and 16 fermions.
in figure 8, we plot the bound state spectrum in the range 0  g  10. it is apparent
now that new massless states appear in the strong coupling limit g  .
an interesting property of the spectrum is the presence of exactly massless states
that persist for all values of the coupling g. for k = 5, there are 16 such states (8
bosons and 8 fermions). at k = 4, one nds 8 states (4 bosons and 4 fermions) that are
exactly massless for any coupling, while for k = 3, there are 4 states (two bosons and two
fermions) with this property. we will have more to say regarding these states in the next
subsection, but here we note that the structure of these states become string-like in the
strong coupling limit. this is illustrated in figure 9, where we plot the average length (or
average number of partons) of each of these massless states16. this quantity is obtained
by counting the number of partons in each fock state that comprises a massless bound
state, appropriately weighted by the modulus of the wave function squared. clearly, at
strong coupling, the average number of partons saturates the maximum possible value
allowed by the resolution  in this case 5 partons. the same behavior is observed at
lower resolutions. thus, in the continuum limit k  , we expect the massless states
16the noisiness in this plot for larger values of g reects the ambiguity of choosing a basis for the

eigen-space, due to the exact mass degeneracy of the massless states.

in this theory to become string-like at strong coupling.

one interesting property of the model studied here is the manifest n = (1, 1) super-
symmetry in the p  = 0 momentum sector, by virtue of the supersymmetry relations
(6.12). moreover, if we consider retaining only the zero mode ni = 0, then the light-cone
supercharge q for the 2 + 1 model is identical to the 1 + 1 dimensional n = (1, 1) su-
persymmetric yang-mills theory studied in [64, 5, 6], after a rescaling by the factor 1/g.
(this is equivalent to expressing the mass squared m 2 in units g2n/, where g = g/l.
the quantity g is then identied as the gauge coupling in the 1 + 1 theory.) we may
therefore think of the additional transverse degrees of freedom in the 2 + 1 model, repre-
sented by the modes n = 1, as a modication of the 1 + 1 model. a natural question
that follows from this viewpoint is: how well does the 1 + 1 spectrum approximate the
2 + 1 spectrum after performing this rescaling? before discussing the numerical results
summarized in table 2, let us rst attempt to predict what will happen at small coupling
g. in this case, the coecients of terms in the rescaled hamiltonian p  that correspond
to summing the transverse momentum squared |k|2 of partons in a state will be large.
so the low energy sector will be dominated by states with n = 0. i.e. those states that
appear in the fock space of the n = (1, 1) model in 1 + 1 dimensions. this is indeed
supported by the results in table 2.
for large coupling g, however, it is clear that the approximation breaks down. in
fact, one can show that the tabulated masses in the rescaled 2 + 1 model tend to zero in
the strong coupling limit, which eliminates any scope for making comparisons between
the two and three dimensional models.

table 2: values for the mass squared m 2, in units g2n/, with g2 = g2/l, for bound states in
the dimensionally reduced n = (1, 1) model, and the 2 + 1 model studied here. the quantity g
is identied as the gauge coupling in the 1 + 1 model. we set k = 3, 4 and 5, and n = 1000.
note that the comparison of masses between the 1 + 1 model, and the (re-scaled) 2 + 1 model
is good only at weak coupling g.

thus, the non-perturbative problem of solving dimensionally reduced models in 1 + 1
dimensions can only provide information about bound state masses in the corresponding
weakly coupled higher dimensional theory.

6.3 analytical results: the massless sector

in the previous subsection we presented the results of studying the bound state problem
using numerical methods. in performing such a study we conveniently chose the simplest
nontrivial truncation of the transverse momentum modes; namely, n = 0,1. surpris-
ingly, such a simple scheme provided many interesting insights concerning the massless
and massive sector. in particular we see that there are three types of massless states;
those that are massless only at g = 0 or g =  (but not both), and those that are massless
for any value of the coupling. in this subsection, we will analyze only the massless sector
of the theory, and show that the observed properties of the spectrum with the truncation
n = 0,1 also persists if we include higher modes: n = 0,1,2, . . . ,nmax. we
therefore consider the model with supercharges given by (6.15) and (6.16), and restrict
summation of transverse momentum modes via the constraint |n|  nmax.
for states carrying positive light-cone momentum, p + is never zero, and so massless
states must satisfy the equation p |i = 0, which, using the relation p  = 12(q)2,
and hermiticity of q, reduces to
(6.17)

q|i = 0.

this is the equation we wish to study in detail.

68

we begin with an analysis of the weak coupling limit of the theory. this limit means

that the dimensionless coupling constant is small: i.e. gl  1. we will consider the

strongweak coupling behavior of the theory on a cylinder with xed circumference l so
it is convenient to choose the units in which l = 1 for this discussion. the supercharge
(6.16) consists of two parts: one is proportional to the coupling and the other is coupling
independent:

q = q + g q.

(6.18)
so at g = 0, the equation (6.17) reduces to q|i = 0, which means that |i may be
viewed as a state in the fock space of the two dimensional n = (1, 1) super yang-mills
theory, which may be obtained by dimensional reduction of the 2 + 1 theory. thus the
massless states at g = 0 are states with any combination of a(k, 0) and b(k, 0) modes,
and no partons with nonzero transverse momentum.

what happens with these massless states when one switches on the coupling? to
answer this question, we need some information about the behavior of states as functions
of the coupling. we assume that wave functions are analytic in terms of g at least in the
vicinity of g = 0. this means that in this region any massless state |i may be written
in the form:

|i =

gn|ni,

(6.19)

xn=0

where states |ni are coupling independent. then using relation (6.18), the gdependent
equation (6.17) may be written as an innite system of relations between dierent |ni:
(6.20)
(6.21)

q|0i = 0,
n > 0.

q|ni + q|n  1i = 0,

the rst of these equations was already used to exclude partons carrying non-zero trans-
verse momentum, which is a property of the massless bound states at zero coupling. the
second equation is non-trivial. let us consider two dierent subspaces in the theory. the
rst of these subspaces consists of states with no creation operators for transverse modes
which we will label 1. the other is the complement of this space in which the operator
q is invertible and we label this space 2. equation (6.21) denes the recurrence relation
when q|n  1i is in subspace 2:

the consistency condition is that projection of q|n  1i in subspace 1 is zero,

this condition implies that not all states of the two dimension theory, g = 0 , may be
extended to such states at arbitrary g using (6.22). taking n = 1, (6.23) implies that
|0i is a massless state of the dimensionally reduced theory. the numerical solutions, of

|ni = q1

q|n  1i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1

= 0.

69

(6.22)

(6.23)

course, show this correspondence between the 2 + 1 and 1 + 1[64, 5, 6] massless bound
states. starting from a massless state of the two dimensional theory, and we construct
states |ni using (6.22), and for which (6.23) is always satised. then |i may be found
from summing a geometric series:

|i =

xn=0
(gq1


q)n|0i =

1

1 + gq1


q|0i.

(6.24)

so, starting from the massless state of the two dimensional n = (1, 1) model, one can
always construct unique massless states in the three dimensional theory at least in the
vicinity of g = 0.

the state (6.24) turns out to be massless for any value of the coupling:

q|i = q(1 + gq1


q)

q|0i = q|0i = 0,

(6.25)

1 + gq1


though the state itself is dependent on g. thus, we have shown that massless states
of the three dimensional theory, at nonzero coupling, can be constructed from massless
states of the corresponding model in two dimensions. all other states containing only
two dimensional modes can also be extended to the eigenstates of the full theory. but
such eigenstates are massless only at zero coupling. assuming analyticity, one can then
show that their masses grow linearly at g in the vicinity of zero. such behavior also
agrees with our numerical results.

to illustrate the general construction explained above we consider one simple example.
working in dlcq at resolution k = 3 we choose a special two dimensional massless
state17 [64, 5, 6]:

then in the su(n) theory we nd:

|0i = tr(a(1, 0)a(2, 0))|vaci.

q|0i =

22htr(cid:16)a(1, 0)(b(1,1)a(1, 1)  a(1, 1)b(1,1)+

q|1i = 0.

(6.26)

(6.27)

(6.28)

(6.29)

(6.30)

the last equation provides the consistency condition (6.23) for n = 2, and it also shows
that for this special example we have only two states |0i and |1i, instead of a general
innite set. the matrix form of the operator 1 + gq1

(6.31)

this state was observed numerically, and the dependence of the wave function on the
coupling constant is precisely the one given by the last formula.

in principle, we can determine the wave functions of all massless states using this
formalism. our procedure has an important advantage over a direct diagonalization of the
three dimensional supercharge. firstly, in order to nd two dimensional massless states,
one needs to diagonalize the corresponding supercharge [64]. however, the dimension of
the relevant fock space is much less than the three dimensional theory (at large resolution
k, the ratio of these dimensions is of order (nmax + 1)k,   1/4). the extension of
the two dimensional massless solution into a massless solution of the three dimensional
theory requires diagonalizing a matrix which has a smaller dimension than the original
problem in three dimensions. thus, if one is only interested in the massless sector of the
three dimensional theory, the most ecient way to proceed in dlcq calculations is to
solve the two dimensional theory, and then to upgrade the massless states to massless
solutions in three dimensions.

finally, we will make some comments on bound states at very strong coupling. of
course, we have states (6.24) which are massless at any coupling, but our numerical
calculation show there are additional states which become massless at g =  (see figure
8). to discuss these state it is convenient to consider

q =

1
g

q + q

(6.32)

instead of q, and perform the strong coupling expansion. since we are interested
only in massless states, the absolute normalization doesnt matter. we repeat all the
arguments used in the weak coupling case: rst, we introduce the space 1 where q can
not be inverted, and its orthogonal complement 2. then any state from 1 is massless
at g = , but assuming the expansion

|i =

xn=0

1
gn|ni

at large enough g, one nds the analogs of (6.22) and (6.23):

|ni =  q1 ( q|n  1i|2) ,
q|n  1i|1 = 0.

(6.33)

(6.34)
(6.35)

as in the small coupling case, there are two possibilities: either one can construct all
states |ni satisfying the consistency conditions, or at least one of these conditions fails.

71

the former case corresponds to the massless state in the vicinity of g = , which can
be extended to the massless states at all couplings. the states constructed in this way
 and ones given by (6.24)  dene the same subspace. in the latter case, the state is
massless at g = , but it acquires a mass at nite coupling. there is a big dierence,
however, between the weak and strong coupling cases. while the kernel of q consists
of two dimensional states, the description of the states annihilated by q is a nontrivial
dynamical problem. since the massless states can be constructed starting from either
g = 0 or g = , we dont have to solve this problem to build them. if, however, one
wishes to show that massless states become long in the strong coupling limit (there is
numerical evidence for such behavior  see figure 9), the structure of 1 space becomes
important, and we leave this question for future investigation.

conclusion.

in these lectures we have reviewed some of the progress in the application of discrete
light cone quantization to supersymmetric systems. studying such systems is especially
interesting because the cancellation between bosonic and fermionic loops make these
theories much easier to renormalize than the models without supersymmetry. although
we didnt need this advantage when considering two dimensional systems, it becomes
crucial in higher dimensions. from this point of view it is desirable to have exact susy
in discretized theories to simplify the renormalization in dlcq.

while we are still far from the point of solving the bound state problem in three and
four dimensional theories, we can already make some statements about these theories.
for example in section 2 we described the vacuum structure of sy m2+1 on a cylinder.
the reason for this is that only zero modes contribute to such structure, thus studying
the theory dimensionally reduced to 1 + 1 provide all the necessary information. as we
saw in section 6, two dimensional models can also be used to determine the behavior of
bound states at weak coupling in three dimensions and to count the exact massless states.
we performed such counting only for (1,1) theory, the case of (2,2) supersymmetry [11]
and the even more interesting case of the (8,8) theory [9] which is known to have a mass
gap have not been addressed.

let us now mention a few of the immediate challenges for sdlcq. first of all is
the extention of the numerical results of section 5 to higher resolution and thus to test
the maldacenas conjecture. the only problem here is the limits in ones computing
resources and the the speed of the algorithems one uses.
impovements here will also
help use to extend our analysis of higher dimensional system and to larger values of
transverse truncation. unfortunately the transverse truncation that we have achieved
so far does not provide much information about behavior of the spectrum as a function
of transverse resolution and was used mainly for illustration of the general concepts.
another consideration is that our approach studies theories on a light like cylinder and
thus our theories may have as aspects in which they are dierent than theories in innite
spacetime or on a space like cylinder.
