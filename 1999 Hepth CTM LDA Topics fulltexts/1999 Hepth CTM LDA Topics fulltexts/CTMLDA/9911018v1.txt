1 introduction

starting with the paper [1] evidence has been gathering in the last two years that ideas of
noncommutative geometry might play an important role in string theory (for a review and
more references see [2]). especially interesting is the model of open strings propogating in
a constant two-form (b-eld) background. this model attracted attention since it could be
studied from the standard perturbative string point of view. previous studies show that
this model is related to noncommutativity of d-branes [3], [4] and in the zero slope limit to
noncommutative yang-mills theory [2]. in this note we would like to study this system from
the old perturbative string perspective concentrating on its symmetries.

in the conformal gauge the model has the following action

s = 

1

4 z

d2 [x x   bx x ] + z

d a x 

(1)

where  is an oriented world-sheet with boundaries and signature (1, 1). for the open
string case the b-eld should appear in a gauge invariant combination with the u(1) gauge
eld b = b + 2[a]. thus the action has the form

s = 

1

4 z d2 [x x   bx x ]

(2)

where b is assumed to be constant. the equation of motion and the boundary conditions
are given by the following expressions

x  = 0,

x  + b x |=0, = 0.

(3)

in what follows we will not impose any pure dirichlet boundary conditions. all results can be
strightforwardly generalized to the case with pure dirichlet conditions. thus using modern
language one can say that we are looking at a d25-brane with constant b-eld.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we sketch some steps of covariant quanti-
zation of the model. in sections 3 and 4 the symmetries and the mass spectrum are discussed.
in last two sections we consider the noncommutative gauge transformation of massless state
and explain how it might be related to the deformation quantization.

2 the old covariant quantization

in this section we sketch some steps of the old covariant approach to quantization. essential
parts of this calculations have already appeared in [3]. however, for the sake of completness

2

we prefer to go through this calculations once more. we will write the equations in such a
way that one can analyze the possible modications of them in dierent situations.

the general form of the bulk equation of motion x  = 0 is given by

x (, ) = q + a

0  + b

0  + xn6=0

ein

n

(ia

n cos n + b

n sin n)

by imposing the boundary condition on (4) we get the following solution

x (, ) = q + (a

0   b

a
0) + xn6=0

ein

n

(ia

n cos n  b

a

n sin n)

one can check that the form of virasoro conditions are not modied

1
4 ( x  x )2 = 0

and using the expansion (5) the constraints (6) can be expanded as follows

lk =

1
4



xn=

ga

na

kn,

g =   bb

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

where g coincides with the notation of 1 [2]. from the action (2) one can dene the
canonical momentum density

p =

1
2 ( x  + bx )

which has the following expansion

p =

1

2



xn=

ga

n ein cos n

the canonical commutation relations have the standard form

(8)

(9)

[p(, ), x (, )] = i

(  ),

[x (, ), x (, )] = [p(, ), p(, )] = 0.

(10)

they imply the commutation relations for the modes. from this point we would like to be
more careful. one can start from the relations [p(, ), p(, )] = 0 and [p(, ), x (, )] =
i

(  ). these relations x uniquely the following commutators

g[a

n, a

m] = 2n

m+n,

g[a

n, q] = 2i

n

(11)

1in euclidean signature the matrix g has the same form.

3

so far we have not assumed anything denite about the matrix g. to proceed one should
assume that g is invertible2. now one can look at the commutator [x (, ), x (, )] =
0. using the mode expansion and commutation relations (11) we get

[x (, ), x (, )] = [q, q]  2i( + )  2i xn6=0

1
n

sin n( + ) = 0

(12)

where  = b
expansion on the interval (0, 2) for ( + )

(g1) and it coincides with notation of [2]. using the following fourier

1
n

xn6=0

sin n( + ) =   ( + )

(13)

we can x commutators for q. thus by requiring the commutation relations to be valid at
all nonboundary points we get the commutators

[a

n, a

m] = 2nn+m(g1),

[a
n, q] = 2in(g1),

[q, q] = 2i

(14)

using (7) and (14) one can show that lk satisfy the virasoro algebra

[lk, ln] = (k  n)lk+n + a(n)k+n

(15)

where using standard arguments [5] one can show that the anomaly has the same value as
in the usual (b = 0) case.

3 symmetries of the model

now let us look at the symmetries of the action (2). naively one might expect the full ten
dimensional poincare group to be a symmetry of the action. the action (2) is certainly
invariant under ten dimensional translations x   x  + b. using the noether theorem we
can nd the correspondig conserved current. the zero component of this current coincides
with the momentum density (8). thus one can dene the momentum operator for the string
as follows

p =

d p(, ) =

1
2 ga
0.



z0

one can check the conservation of momentum explicitly

p =

1

2



z0

d ( x  + b x ) =

1
2 (x  + b x )|=0, = 0.

2invertibility is guaranteed as long as b0i components are not too large. see below.

(16)

(17)

we can rewrite the commutations relations for the zero modes as follows

[q, p] = i
 ,

[q, q] = 2i.

(18)

now let us take a look at the lorentz symmetry of the model. if the b-eld is regarded
as a constant background then the lorentz symmetry is broken down to such transforma-
tions which preserve the form of b. to analyze the question we can perform so(d  1, 1)
transformation which brings b to the canonical block diagonal form

(b) =

and thus g will have the following form

where  = (1, 1, ..., 1). in other words we rewrite the action (2) in coordinates such that
b assumes the above form. in the euclidian version of the theory one should replace g00
and g11 by 1 + 2
1. in the minkowski case g can acquire a 0 eigenvalue when 1 = 1. in
this case we will have problems with imposing the canonical commutation relations (10) on
the model. thus one can conclude that the model is not well-dened at all values of 1.

by looking at (19) one can nd the lorentz group of the model. if 1 = 2 = ... = r
and the rest are dierent then the lorentz group will be  = so(2r  1, 1) (so(2))(d/2r)
for generic values of the remaining is. by adjusting the values of the remaining is one can
enhance the symmetry group to  = so(2r1, 1)k
l=1 nl = (d2r)/2.
this is done by adjusting the s to coincide in groups of nl taking a total of k dierent
values. by denition the new lorentz group  will preserve the form of g and . thus
any constructions with these objects are lorentz covariant in the present model. the natural
scalar product of the lorentz group is given by k(g1)p where k and p are vectors which

l=1(so(2nl)) wherepk

5

transform under the new lorentz group . as a result we will see that in mass spectrum
all particles are classied under the irreduciable representations of the new poincare group
which is a semidirect product of the new lorentz group  and ten dimensional group of
translations.

to understand better the commutation relations (18) it is useful to write down the explicit

form of  in the basis where b has the form (19)

(21)

ignoring the components of b eld along the time direction we can see that the components
of || are bounded by 1/2 and || takes the maximal value when b-eld is 1 (|| = 1).
thus from (18) we get the following uncertanty relation

qq 

1
2



(22)

at  = 1. we see that the maximal noncommutative eect appears when b is of order one
and the maximal cells have a size of order . therefore in this situation only one degree
of freedom can be per plank cell. the general situation can be summarized as follows: as b
eld () varies from 0 to  we are going from pure neumann boundary conditions to pure
dirichlet ones. as we are approaching these limiting situations the noncommutativity dies.

4 mass spectrum

we can now analyze the mass spectrum. the hamiltonian l0 of the system is:

l0 = p(g1)p +

1

2 xn6=0

ng

n
n

(23)

n = q2|n|

where a
n (for n 6= 0) and p is dened by (16). arguments from the previous
section indicate that the correct casimir for the new poincare group is m 2 = p(g1)p.
we assume that 2
1 < 1 (so the metric g does not become degenerate) the quantization
can be done in the standard way by imposing virasoro conditions on the physical states:

6

(l0  1)|p hysi = 0 and ln|p hysi = 0 for n > 0. therefore the expression for the masses of
string states is the following

m 2 =



xn=1

n(+

n )g(n)  1

(24)

where we used (+
the states will transform under non standard poincare group. 3.

n ) = 

n. thus one can see that we get the usual spectrum except that

there is a massless state in the model: (k)

1|o, ki. requiring that l0  1 and l1

annihilate the state implies:

k(g1)k = 0,

(k)(g1)k = 0.

(25)

it is important to stress that  is not a massless vector in normal sense. it transforms as a
massless vector under the new lorentz group .

the next important question is the following, what is the real gauge transformation
for this massless gauge boson. recall that in ordinary (b = 0) open string theory gauge
transformations amount to a shift of the state by a null state (the physical state which is
orthogonal to all physical states and therefore it has zero norm):

(k)

1|0, ki  (k)

1|0, ki + k(k)

1|0, ki

(26)

in this case one can show that the shifted state has zero norm on shell, k2 = 0. in the next
section we will explicitly show that a noncommutative gauge transformation in the b 6= 0
case results in a shift by a null state as well.

5 noncommutative gauge transformation of massless

state

in these two last sections we would like to take a naive (but hopefully transparent) look at
the noncommutative transformations and its relation to the deformation quantization.

let us sketch some important properties of commutative and noncommutative gauge
transformations which we are going to use. for the case of the usual abelian gauge transfor-
mation we have the following invariance

(27)
3if one tries to dene the mass operator as m 2 = p p the spectrum of the string turns out to be

a(x)  a(x) + (x)

continuous which is not one would expect for a sensible string theory.

7

or in momentum represenation

where we are using the following notation

(k)  (k) + ik(k)

a(x) =

1

(2)d/2 z ddk eikx(k),

(k) =

1

(2)d/2 z ddx eikxa(x)

(28)

(29)

and  is the fourier component of . the reality condition for a(x) and (x) corresponds
to the following condition 
(k) = (k), (k) = (k). the condition k(k) = 0
corresponds to the lorentz condition for a.

noncommutative u(1) gauge transformations act as follows:

a  a +  + i  a  ia  

where the star product has the following standard denition

f (x)  g(x) = ei 





 f (x + )g(x + )|==0

in the momentum representation we have

1

(2)d/2 z ddx eikx(f (x)  g(x)) =

1

(2)d/2 z ddp ei pk f(p)g(k  p)

where

f (x) =

1

(2)d/2 z ddp eipx f(p),

g(x) =

1

(2)d/2 z ddl eilxg(l)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

using (30) and (32) one can get the noncommutative gauge transformation in momentum
representation

(k)  (k) + ik(k) +

2

(2)d/2 z ddp (p)(k  p) sin(pk)

(34)

for the case when d is even (in odd case there are some problems).

to show that the transformation (34) is a gauge transformation we should show that the

following state is null:

z ddp (p)(k  p) sin(pk)

1|o, ki = f(k)

1|o, ki

or in other words one has to prove that the following two properties hold

f(k)k = 0,

f(k)f (k) = 0,


(k)f (k) = 0

8

(35)

(36)

when the properties (25) hold. the properties (36) insure that the state (35) is a physical and
it is orthogonal to all physical states. let us show that equations (36) are true. introducing
the notation

a(k) = f(k)k = z ddp (p)(k  p)k sin(pk)

(37)
one can show that a(k) = a(k) using the reality conditions for a and . one can
equivalently write (37) as:

a(k) = f(k)k = z ddp (p)(k  p)p sin(pk)

(38)

where we used (k  p) (k  p) = 0. from (38) again using the reality conditions one can
show that a(k) = a(k) and therefore a(k) = 0. since kf (k) = 0 is just lorentz gauge
condition we require this condition to be true o-shell.

now we can prove that the second property in (36) is true. the combination f(k)f (k) =
g(k2) is lorentz invariant and therefore it can depend only on k2. we are only interested
in the value of g(k2) when k2 = 0. thus it is just a constant which one can calculate by
picking some concrete value of k which saties k2 = 0. we can do it for k = (0, 0, ..., 0)
and nd that it is zero. the last condition conditions in (36) can be proven in the same way.
thus we have proven all conditions in (36).

6 general gauge transformation and deformation quan-

tization

one can try to address the following question: what is the general form of a null state which
corresponds to gauge transformations. in this section we would like to argue that in general a
gauge transformation is related to deformation quantization with respect to . the relation
between open string model in b eld background and the deformation quantization was
originaly pointed out in [6].

there is only one local solution for conditions (36) which correspond to k(k). all other
solutions will be nonlocal in momentum space. since we are interested in innitesimal gauge
transformations, a null state should be linear in the gauge eld  and gauge parameter .
thus the general solution has the form

f(k) = z ddp (p)(k  p)g(p, k  p)

where g(p, k  p) is a kernel with the following property

g(p, k + p) = g(p,k  p) = g(p, k + p).

9

(39)

(40)

the property (40) comes from the reality condition f 
two extra properties for the function g(p, k  p)

(k) = f(k) = f(k). we require

g(p,k  p) = g(p, k  p),

g(p, k + p) = g(p, k  p)

(41)

which ensures the condition kf = 0 o-shell. as result of (41) we have g(p,p) = 0 and
it gives us other two properties in (36) on-shell. it is important to notice that the function
g(p, k  p) is dened up to gauge eld and gauge parameter redenitions
.

f(k) = z ddp (p)s(p)(k  p)s(k  p)

g(p, k  p)
s(p)s(k  p)

(42)

these redenitions should not modify the on-shell physics.
modify the on-shell state

in other words it shoud not

(k)

1|o, ki  s(k)(k)

1|o, ki,

s(0) = 1

(43)

the function s(k) has a natural expansion in powers of . in the coordinate space these
redenitions correspond to the following transformation:

a  a + d1(a) + ()2d2(a) + ...

(44)

where di are dierential operators. these redenitions produce the group of automorphisms
on the space of gauge elds. since we would like to understand the general form of o-shell
gauge transformation it is important to look at the possible eld redenitions which do not
aect the on-shell physics.

g(p, k  p) is a dimensionless scalar function and it can be expanded in powers of .
lorentz invariance requires that it is a function of momenta with all indices contracted using
either  or (g1). in coordinate representation the expansion has the form

a = b1(, a) + ()2b2(, a) + ...

(45)

where bi are bidierential operators, the general possible form can be easily written down.
the null states (39) should correspond to some gauge symmetry. the nite gauge transfor-
mations belong to a group. therefore at level of innitesimal transformations one has to
require:

a  a = {,}a

(46)

where {, } is the bracket with respect to some associative algebra. it turns out that the
requirement (46) is quite restrictive for the form of the kernel g(p, k  p). from (46) in the
momentum space one can read o the bracket as follows

{, }(p) = z dd p (p)(p  p)"g(p  p)g(p, k  p)  g(p, k  p)g(p  p, k  p + p)

#

g(p, k  p)

(47)

10

the kernel k(p, p  p) for bracket (expression in brackets) does not depend on vector k and
should be antisymmetric (k(p, p  p) = k(p  p, p)). using these requirements one can
arrive at conclusion that k(p, p  p) = g(p, p  p). thus in the coordinate space the gauge
transformation has a from of bracket: a = {, a} and the requirement (46) is just
jacobi identity for this bracket. using antisymmetry of g we can write down the leading
term of the gauge transformation as follows

a = g1a + o(2).

(48)

in general a bracket can be dened in terms of some associative product  as follows:

{f1, f2} = f1  f2  f2  f1,
and let g be the kernel of the product in momentum space:

(49)

1

(2)d/2 z ddx eikx(f1(x) f2(x)) =

1

(2)d/2 z ddp ei pk f1(p) f2(k  p)g(p, k  p) (50)

where

fi(x) =

1

(2)d/2 z ddp eipx fi(p).

the g and g kernels are related in the following obvious way

g(p, k  p) = g(k, k  p)  g(k  p, p)

(51)

(52)

thus one can see that by looking for the general gauge transformation we are arriving at
the problem of classication of associative product which is dened as power series in .
we are interested in this product up to eld redenitions (44). this is exactly the star
product construction considered by kontsevich [7]. due to kontsevich in the present case
the appropriate star product (up to eld redenitions) is given by moyal product.

however we can analyze the concrete form of the star product in the strightforward way.
since g(p, kp) is a scalar it only depends on scalars constructed from k and p by contracting
indices with either the metric g or the anti-symmetric . thus g is the function of four
possible kinematic invariants which one can construct from vectors p and kp. associativity
of the -product implies the following constraint on the kernel g:

g(q, p  q)g(p, k  p) = g(p  q, k  p)g(q, k  q).

(53)

to analyze (53) one should rewrite everything in terms of all possible kinematic invariants.
in turns out that associativity written in this form is strong enough to restrict g to be of the
form:

g(p, k  p) = eicp q f (k2).

11

(54)

where we have used the eld redenitions in form (42).

expressing g as the kernel of the bracket with respect to the  product then gives
exactly the non-commutative gauge transformations of the previous section up to some trivial
redenitions. thus we have shown in the other direction that null states corresponding to
gauge transformations are always of the form (30).

certainly the present analysis is naive and to make it precise one should show that the
corresponding null states have the form qbrst|i where qbrst is the brst generator. the
standard brst analysis for the open string theory is not the right one to address the question
of noncomutativity. as we saw the noncomutativity involves all orders of . therefore one
should modify somehow the standard brst approach to address these questions. previously
from other reasoning it was argued that standard brst complex should be modied [8].
we hope to come back to this question elsewhere.

7 conclusions and discussion

in this paper we have analyzed open string theory in the presence of a constant b-eld. we
discussed the space-time symmetries of the problem and discussed the gauge invariance of
the massless vector boson state using naive covariant quantization. our main motivation
for doing this was to re-derive the non-commutative gauge invariance of the system in a
transparent way. following the logic of two last sections one can expect as well some non-
commutative properties for gauge transformations of gravitational and antisymmetric elds.
this noncommutativity for b-eld was indicated recently in [9].

it is straightforward to analyze closed strings in the presence of a b-eld which has a
ux through a non-trivial 2-cycle. from the logic presented in last two sections one might
expect as well some noncommutative properties for the closed strings. this theory has some
interesting features and will be discussed in a subsequent article.
