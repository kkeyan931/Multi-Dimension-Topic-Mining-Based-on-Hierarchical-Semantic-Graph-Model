abstract

we investigate nonperturbative eects in n=1 supersymmetric theories and
propose a new expression for the eective action, which correctly reproduces quan-
tum anomalies and agrees with the transformation law of instanton measure. actu-
ally the result is a nonperturbative extension of veneziano-yankielowitch eective
lagrangian. the possibility of integrating out the gluino condensate is discussed.

1 introduction

investigation of nonperturbative dynamics is a very important problem of quantum
eld theory. it is well known [1, 2], that except for perturbative corrections there is a
series of instanton contributions. their sum was found exactly in [3] for n=2 super-
symmetric yang-mills theory with su(2) gauge group in the constant eld limit.
it
was checked, that the asymptotic of exact result reproduced one-instanton contribution
correctly [4, 5].

attempts to construct exact results for n=1 susy theories were made in [6, 7].
however, the corresponding results do not agree with instanton calculations. (in the case
nf = nc  1 the agreement takes place only at the one-instanton level [4], while higher
instanton corrections break it.) moreover, aeck-dine-seiberg results do not produce
correct expressions for anomalies, because they do not contain any gauge degrees of
freedom.

in principle, at the perturbative level the anomalies is correctly reproduced by the
veneziano-yankielowitch eective lagrangian [8], containing gluino condensate. how-
ever, this result is not applicable beyond the frames of perturbation theory.

the purpose of the present paper is to obtain the exact (nonperturbative) eective
lagrangian for n=1 susy yang-mills theory with matter. it should correctly reproduce
anomalies, be in agreement with instanton calculations (at least with the transformation
law of the collective coordinate measure) and have a structure similar to the n=2 case
(because n=2 susy theories have also n=1 susy).

in order to do it we will use the method, based on the consideration of quantum
anomalies [9] beyond the frames of perturbation theory. the rst exact expression was
found recently for r-anomaly in n=2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory [10, 11, 12, 13].
due to the instanton contributions it diers from the perturbative result. 1

the derivation was based on the seiberg and witten exact expression [3], but the
result appeared to have a very simple interpretation: exact anomaly is a vacuum ex-
pectation value of the perturbative one. nevertheless, for checking this relation one
should essentially use the exact prepotential, found in [3] by completely dierent meth-
ods. thus, we come to the question, whether it is possible to solve the inverse problem,
i.e. to derive exact results from the form of anomalies. this idea really allows to derive
seiberg-witten solution in n=2 susy su(2) yang-mills theory and the general struc-
ture of picard-fuchs equations in other n=2 susy theories (rst obtained in [15, 16]
by other methods) [17].

in the present paper the corresponding approach is applied to n=1 supersymmetric

yang-mills theories.

our paper is organized as follows:
in section 2 we briey discuss the relation between perturbative and exact anomalies,
which is used in section 3 to derive the exact eective lagrangian. first, in subsections
3.1 we apply it (together with the results of appendix b and d) to investigate the
general structure of the superpotential. the exact result is obtained in subsection
3.2.
in section 4 we discuss the possibility of integrating out the gluino condensate
and equivalence of the obtained expression and seibergs exact results. conclusion is
devoted to the brief review and discussion of the results. in the appendix a we review the
necessary information concerning sypersymmetric theories and summarize our notations.
then, in appendix b we investigate the structure of nonperturbative corrections, that
agrees with the transformation law of the collective coordinate measure under u(1)x
transformations.
in appendix c we briey review the structure of moduli space for
n=1 supersymmetric theories, that is used in appendix d to rewrite the eective action
in the gauge invariant form.

1 such possibility was pointed rather long ago [14], but a series of instanton corrections with unknown

coecients produced considerable diculties.

2 the relation between perturbative and exact

anomalies

now let us consider n=1 supersymmetric su(nc) yang-mills theory with nf mat-
ter supermultiplets and nd the general structure of the eective superpotential and
anomalies. (our notation are summarized in appendix a.)

the eective lagrangian can be split into the following parts [8]

where

lef f = lk + la + lm,

lk = z d4 k(s, s , , );
la = rez d2 w(s, )

(1)

(2)

and s  trw 2 is the gluino condensate.
here lk denotes kinetic term, that does not contribute to the anomaly, la is a
holomorphic part of the superpotential and lm is a mass term. below we will consider
only massless case (lm = 0). therefore, the only nontrivial contribution to anomalies
comes from la and it is the only part, that we are able to investigate. (our method can
not give any information about a possible kinetic term.)

in order to dene la we consider the anomaly of u(1)x-symmetry (for more details

see appendix a)

u(1)x : w ()  eiw (ei5);
()  eix(ei5);
()  eix (ei5)

(3)

beyond the frames of perturbation theory. the result can be found by using the relation
between perturbative and exact anomalies.

of course, exact anomalies are quite dierent from perturbative ones. for example,
the exact expression for r-anomaly in the n=2 susy su(2) yang-mills theory, found
by transforming seiberg-witten eective action [10, 18], is

of course, the expressions (4) and (7) are quite dierent. the former is a series over

and nevertheless, the nonperturbative result is only a vacuum expectation value
of the perturbative one, that in particular produces a natural solution of anomalies

(13)

it is just the relation, mentioned above. of course, it is valid for a wide range of
models and is really a point to start with. let us note, that the derivation presented
in [10] essentially used the form of exact results. so, we are tempted to reverse the
arguments. in the next section we will try to apply this approach to n=1 susy theories.

3 exact eective lagrangian

3.1 general structure

let us apply (13) to n=1 supersymmetric su(nc) yang-mills theory with nf matter
supermultiplets. at the perturbative level the anomaly of u(1)x-symmetry has the
following form

j 

x = (cid:16)  nf + nc + xnf(cid:17) 1

162 trff
= (cid:16)nf  nc  xnf(cid:17) 1

162 im trz d2 w 2,

so that the exact anomaly is

hj 

xi = (cid:16)nf  nc  xnf(cid:17) 1

162 imz d2 u

(14)

(15)

where u  htrw 2i. therefore, the eective lagrangian should depend in particular on
s = trw 2. this result is not new. at the perturbative level the similar investigation
was made in [8]. however, in this paper we do not intend to restrict ourselves by the
frames of perturbation theory. therefore, we can not assume, that u = trw 2 (here we
would like to remind (8)).

taking into account the dependence on the gluino condensate and performing u(1)x

transformation in the eective action, from the other side we obtain

hj 

xi = 




= imz d2(cid:16)2w  2

w

v(cid:17).

comparing (15) with (16) and taking into account, that the equality should be satised
for all x, we obtain

162 (nf  nc)u;

2w  2

162 nf u.

(17)

this equation is very similar to the results of [8]. nevertheless, there is a crucial dier-
ence: u 6= s. therefore, one can only conclude that
nf  nc

= 0.

(18)

this equation corresponds to the exact conservation of r-symmetry at nonperturba-
tive level. the similar condition was used in [6, 7], although the dependence w = w(s)
was ignored. of course, it is quite clear, that integrating s out yields ads superpotential
[20] and corresponds to imposing the condition

w
s

= 0.

(19)

nevetheless, this equation can have no solutions. in this case the gluino condensate can
not be integrated out of the eective action and it is impossible to obtain seibergs exact
results. below we will discuss equation (19) in details.

it is desirable, that the solution of (18) agrees with instanton calculations. the
necessary condition of it is the agreement with the transformation law of the instanton
measure. the presence of the gluino condensate in the eective action allows to achieve
it. the possible structure of instanton corrections is analysed in the appendix b. the
result for n-instanton correction has the following form

w(n) = sgn  v3

s !(cid:18)
v(cid:19)

n(3ncnf )

where gn is an arbitrary function.

it can be easily veried, that the only solution of (18), agreeing with (20)2, is

w =

f (z) = fpert(z) +

3therefore, for nc = nf +1 rst instanton correction does not contain gluino condensate, that allows
to compare it with ads-superpotential [4]. however, higher corrections depend on s and destroy the
agreement. so, the statement, that in this case instantons generate ads-superpotential is not correct.

in the nal result z should be written in terms of gauge invariant variables. of
course, the result will depend on the structure of moduli space, that is briey reviewed
in appendix c. the derivation, made in appendix d, gives

in order to dene fpert we note, that at the perturbative level u = s. therefore, in

this case (17) gives

(24)

(25)

(26)

that denes all anomalies in the theory according to (15). at the perturbative level both
(25) and (26) are certainly in agreement with [8].

3.2 exact result

let us dene f exactly. the general structure of the holomorphic superpotential,
found in section 3.1, is similar to the structure of the nonperturbative prepotential in
the n=2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory [21]. in the latter case the relation between
perturbative and nonperturbative anomalies leads to picard-fuchs equations [17], that
can be used for derivation of exact results. is it possible to extend this approach to the
case of n=1 supersymmetry?

first we substitute (21) into (17), that gives

s

df
dz

z = u

(27)

(and therefore u/s depends only on z).

the way to solve this equation is indicated by the analogy with n=2 supersymmetric

su(2) yang-mills theory. in terms of n=1 superelds its action is written as

let us compare it with

sa =

322 rez d4xd2 sf (z)

(28)

(29)

and introduce a  z1/4 (this choice of the power will be explained below). the rst
term in (28) will coincide with (29) if

then (27) takes the form

fd = f  aad;

ad =

.

(30)

(31)

(32)

this equation coincides with (6) and, therefore, we are tempted to identify f with
seiberg-witten solution.
it is so. really, dierentiating (31) with respect to u, we
obtain

it means, that a and ad are 2 independent solutions of the picard-fuchs equation

upert = w 2 = s,

so that

however, the perturbative solution does not satisfy the requirement [3, 22]

(37)

(38)

that is derived exactly as in the n=2 case. therefore, two singularities (at u = 0 and
u = ) are impossible.
to nd the structure of singularities let us note, that the solution (25) should contain
all positive powers of z and, therefore, is invariant under z4 transformations a  eik/2a.
taking into account (30) and (26) we conclude, that the corresponding transformations
in the u-plane are u  eiku. thus, singularities of l(u) in the picard-fuchs equation
for each singularity at u = u0 there is another one at
(34) should come in pairs:
u = u0.
therefore, the considered model is completely equivalent to n=2 supersymmetric
su(2) yang-mills theory without matter and the only possible form of picard-fuchs
equation (up to the redenition of ) is

with the solution [3, 22]

and now it is quite clear, that the choice a = z1/4 was made to obtain the true

structure of instanton corrections (21).

so, our main result is

(44)

4 on the impossibility to integrate out the gluino

condensate for nc > nf

in this section we will discuss the possibility of integrating the gluino condensate

out of the exact superpotential. substituting (44) into the condition

w
s

= 0

we can rewrite the latter in the following form (a = z1/4)

taking the perturbative asymptotic of the exact result we nd, that

(nf  nc)

(45)

(46)

(47)

of course, this equation has solution for all values of nf and nc. therefore, at the
perturbative level the gluino condensate can be always integrate out, as it is usually
assumed [20]. however, the situation is quite dierent beyond the frames of the per-
turbation theory. for the investigation it is very convenient to rewrite seiberg-witten
solution in terms of elliptic functions [24]

a(u) =

k

e(k);

ad(u) =

4

ik(cid:16)e (k)  k (k)(cid:17)

where k2 = 2/(1 + u). the functions e, k, e  and k  are dened as

this form is very convenient for the computer research. performing this work we

used the analytical calculation system mapple.

the function

d ln a
d ln 

(51)

is plotted at the fig.1 (curve 1.). for comparisons at this gure we also present its
perturbative asymptotic (curve 2.).

for a   the perturbative result almost coincides with the exact one. however,
there are crucial dierences for small a. elliptic functions are real only for k2 = 2/(1 +
u) < 1. in a region, where the perturbation theory is not applicable (k2  0), (51) is
also positive. it is equal to 0 for k2 = 0, which corresponds a = 4/. therefore, the
range of values of (51) is [0,) and equation (46) has a solution only for a positive rhs,
i.e. nc  nf .
for nc = nf the classical constrain detm bb = 0 is broken by instanton corrections
[7] as

in the frames of our approach it is produced automatically, because in this case

detm  bb = const 2nf

(52)

(53)

la =

imz d2 s ((cid:16)

detm  bb(cid:17)1/4

)

and, therefore, the gluino condensate is a natural lagrange multiplier. integrating it
out, we obtain the equation  (a) = 0 which has a solution

finally, we obtain, that in this case

a = (cid:16)

5 conclusion.

(54)

(55)

in the present paper we obtain the exact (nonperturbative) eective lagrangian (44)
for n=1 susy yang-mills theories with matter. our result has the following dierences
from the ones, found in [6, 7]: firstly, it agrees with the transformation law of the
collective coordinate measure under the chiral symmetries, due to the presence of gluino
condensate s. secondly, the result correctly reproduces anomalies beyond the frames

11

of perturbation theory. and, nally, it has the same structure as the seiberg-witten
solution.

to derive the exact expression we developed a method, based on the relation be-
tween perturbative and exact anomalies. here we should mention, that the similar
approach was presented very long ago by veneziano and yankielowitch [8]. neverthe-
less, their derivation is valid only in the perturbation theory. we would like to attract
the attention, that veneziano-yankielowitch eective lagrangian is not applicable at the
nonperturbative level.

so, our result can be considered as a syntheses of veneziano-yankielowitch eective
lagrangian and seibergs exact results, which is free from some of their shortcomings.

b structure of instanton corrections versus collec-

tive coordinate measure transformation law

in order to dene a structure of eective potential we will calculate anomalies by 2
dierent ways and compare the results. 4 the action is invariant under u(1)1  u(1)2
group. however, it is more convenient to investigate the anomaly of u(1)x symmetry,
constructed in appendix a.

performing u(1)x transformation in the eective action we obtain

where we substituted  and  by their vacuum expectation values v. (for simplicity we
assume, that all vi are equal; a brief review of the moduli space structure is given in the
appendix c.)

on the other hand, the anomaly can be found from the transformation law of the

collective coordinate measure.

at the one-instanton level in this case there are 4 + n 2

c bose zero modes, 2nc gluino
zero modes (corresponding to supersymmetric (a) and superconformal (a) transforma-
tions) and 2nf zero modes for matter multiplets (supersymmetry a). each zero mode
should be removed by integration over the corresponding collective coordinate. the
measure is written as [26]

where we take into account normalization of all zero modes. the gauge part and constant
factors are written only schematically, because they are not important in our discussion.
as above we need not know the explicit form of the action in the constant eld limit.
we should only emphasize, that it is a dimensionless function of collective coordinates,
 and, in principle, w . of course, it is not invariant under u(1)x-transformations

4this approach was rst used in [25] for n=2 supersymmetric su(2) yang-mills theory.

have been invariant, if we had made additional rotation

v  ei(2x)v;

w  e2i5w.

(75)

however, we can not make it because v and w are not collective coordinates (and,
therefore, integration variables). it means, that under (74)

s(v, w )  s(ei(x2)v, e2i5w );
d(v)  exphi(cid:16)  2(3nc  2nf )  2nf x + 2nf (x  2)  2nf(cid:17)i d(ei(x2)v)
= exphi(cid:16)  2(3nc  nf )(cid:17)i d(ei(x2)v).

(76)

it is quite evident, that the n-instanton collective coordinate measure is transformed as

d(v)  exphi(cid:16)  2n(3nc  nf )(cid:17)i d(ei(x2)v).

(77)

moreover, we should also perform the inverse substitution in the remaining integral (see
the denition of the superpotential)

16

so that nally from (75), (77) and (78) we conclude, that

z d4xd2  e4iz d4xd2,

w(v, w )  exphi(cid:16)  2n(3nc  nf ) + 4(cid:17)i w(ei(x2)v, e2i5w ).

taking into account that the action contains only (1 + 5)w , we nd the anomaly to be

its explicit form can be found from the relation

of course, the result (82) is in a complete agreement with dimensional arguments

and does not depend on the particular choice of symmetry (i.e. x).

ric theories

to describe the vacuum states it is convenient to introduce two nf  nc matrixes of

the form

however, their overall number is greater than 2ncnf  n 2
c + 1. the matter is that at the
classical level these elds are not independent and satisfy some constraints. for example,
if nf = nc the number of massless superelds is n 2
f + 2. the
constraint eliminating the redundant chiral variable is

f + 1 while nm + nb = n 2

and are no longer valid [7].

these constrains are broken by instanton corrections. in the eective action approach
the modications should be produced automatically. it can be achieved by integrating
out the s-supereld. (in particular, for nf = nc s is a natural lagrange multiplier).
the result should have the following form [27]:

(97)

we would like to mention, that in the presented approach (95) certainly contains

multiinstanton corrections, that contribute to the overall constant factor in the rhs.
