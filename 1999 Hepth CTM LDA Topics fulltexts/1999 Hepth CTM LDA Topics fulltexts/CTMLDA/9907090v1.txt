classical properties of 1/4 bps dyons were previously well understood both in the eld
theory context and in the string theory context. its quantum properties, however, have
been more dicult to probe, although the elementary information of the supermultiplet
structures is known from a perturbative construction. recently, a low energy eective
theory of monopoles was constructed and argued to contain these dyons as quantum
bound states. in this paper, we nd these dyonic bound states explicitly in the n =
4 supersymmetric low energy eective theory. after identifying the correct angular
momentum operators, we motivate an anti-self-dual ansatz for all bps bound states.
the wavefunctions are found explicitly, whose spin contents and degeneracies match
exactly the expected results.

introduction

in the n=4 supersymmetric yang-mills theories, there can be 1/2 bps and 1/4 bps congurations.

the precise nature of these states depends on the asymptotic values of six higgs elds in the

theory. when the higgs expectation values have only one independent component, only 1/2 bps

congurations can appear. classically, 1/2 bps congurations are made of monopoles or dyons,

and its electric eld is proportional to its magnetic eld. when the higgs expectation values have

two or more independent components, 1/4 bps congurations can also appear, which are all dyons

whose electric charge is not proportional to its magnetic charge [1, 2, 3].

any 1/2 bps conguration of a given collection of monopoles is specied by their moduli

parameters, and the low energy dynamics of these 1/2 bps monopoles is determined by the metric

on the manifold spanned by these moduli parameters [4]. on the other hand, as shown in ref. [2, 3],

solutions to 1/4 bps equations can be obtained in two steps: first, one solves for purely magnetic

soliton, which may be regarded as 1/2 bps in a technical sense. then, one solves for certain linear

combination of gauge zero modes in this purely magnetic background. curiously enough, one can

build the electric part of the 1/4 bps dyons from such gauge zero mode. because existence of

gauge zero modes are guaranteed for any 1/2 bps monopole [5], any 1/4 bps conguration is

again specied by the moduli parameters of the corresponding 1/2 bps monopole conguration.

given a xed set of moduli parameters, the solution of the second bps equation determines relative

part of the electric charge of monopoles uniquely.

one may regard 1/4 bps congurations as deformed 1/2 bps congurations when the ad-

ditional and independent higgs expectation is turned on. when this second higgs expectation is

quite small compared to the rst, the deviation of the 1/4 bps congurations from the 1/2 bps

conguration is small. in such cases, the authors (with c. lee) have shown in a recent paper [6]

that one can describe the low energy dynamics of both 1/2 bps and 1/4 bps congurations with

an eective nonrelativistic lagrangian.

the kinetic part of the lagrangian is given by the moduli space metric of the 1/2 bps

congurations. the potential is also present, and is given by the square of the norm of a tri-

holomorphic killing vector eld related to an unbroken u (1) gauge symmetry. the size of this

attractive potential is proportional to the square of the additional higgs expectation value. this

eective lagrangian can be interpreted as low energy dynamics of 1/2 bps monopoles with attrac-

tive potential, in other words, and the 1/4 bps congurations should be realized as bps bound

states of monopoles with additional electric quantum numbers.

1

in ref. [6], the full n=4 supersymmetric low energy eective lagrangian is written. this is

a sigma model with potential that has extended complex supersymmetry with a central term, and,

as usual, the wavefunctions can be interpreted as dierential forms on the moduli space. the bps

equation was found and translated to the language of dierential forms.

the simplest nontrivial 1/4 bps congurations appear as composite of two distinct funda-

mental magnetic monopoles in su (3) gauge theory. furthermore, the 8-dimensional moduli space

of these two monopoles is known exactly. from ref. [2], several facts are known about this case.

first of all, classical 1/4 bps congurations are made of two 1/2 bps dyons at rest, whose mutual

distance is determined by their relative electric charge. also, the supermultiplet structures of all

such dyons have been found by the perturbative method around the 1/2 bps state of the zero

relative electric charge, where the nonzero relative charge states are constructed by exciting certain

massive excitations on 1/2 bps congurations.

in this paper, we reconstruct these 1/4 bps dyons as quantum bound state of two distinct

su (3) monopoles in the low energy dynamics described above. we construct all such su (3) dyons.

we also recover the phenomenon of instability found in ref. [1, 2]: the bound state wavefunction

loses its normalizability exactly at the point where the instability should set in. furthermore, we

explicitly show that each (stable) dyon comes in the same supermultiplet as found in ref. [2]

the plan of the paper is as follows. in sec. 2, we briey discuss the moduli space of a pair of

distinct monopoles in su (3) theory. in sec. 3, we review briey the supersymmetric hamiltonian

and bps conditions on wavefunctions as shown in ref. [6].

in sec. 4, we discuss the angular

momentum and an ansatz for the bps wave functions. in sec. 5, we solve the bps equations. in

sec. 6, we conclude with some comments.

2 a pair of distinct monopoles in the su(3) gauge theory

consider n = 4 su (3) gauge theory spontaneously broken to u (1)2. when the six higgs expecta-

tions are all collinear, the theory contains two distinct types of fundamental monopoles, which we

will label by  and . the low energy interaction between  and  monopoles can be described

by the moduli space dynamics. there are four collective coordinates for each monopole, three for

its position and one for the u (1) phase. we call their positions and phases to be xi, i, i = 1, 2,

for  and  monopoles, respectively. let us parameterize the masses of these monopoles as 1 and

2. we are suppressing the gauge coupling constant in all subsequent formulae.

2

the exact nonrelativistic eective lagrangian has been found to be a sum of the lagrangians

for the center of mass and the relative motion [7]. as there is no external force, the center of mass

lagrangian is a free one:

lcm =

(1 + 2)

2

x2 +

1

2(1 + 2)

2
t ,

(1)

where the center of mass position is x = (1x1 + 2x2)/(1 + 2) and the center of mass phase

is t = 1 + 2. the relative motion between them is more complicated and described by the

taub-nut metric [8, 9], and has the lagrangian,

lrel =



2  (1 +

1
r

)r2 +

1

2(1 + 1

r )

(  + w(r)  r)2! ,

(2)

where the relative position is r = x2  x1, the relative phase is  = 2(12  21)/(1 + 2), and
w(r) is the dirac potential such that   w(r) = r/r3. the range of  is [0, 4]. from now on,
we will suppress the scale  by setting  = 1. the resulting monopole moduli space metric is then,

grel = (cid:18)1 +

1

r(cid:19) dr2 +(cid:18)

1

1 + 1/r(cid:19) (d + w(r)  dr)2,

(3)

up to an overall scale. this taub-nut space, m0, has the topology of r4 = r+  s3. the
eight-dimensional, total moduli space is then given by

m = r3 

r1  m0

z

,

where z is the identication map

(t , ) = (t + 2,  +

42

1 + 2

).

(4)

(5)

for later convenience, we will make another choice of coordinates involving euler angles on

s3,

grel = (cid:18)1 +

r(cid:19) [dr2 + r22

1 + r22

1

1 + 1/r

3,

where the as are 1-form frames on s3, and satisfy the canonical relationship,

da =

1
2

abc b  c.

more explicitly, we may write these 1-forms in terms of su (2) euler angles as follows

1 =  sin d + cos  sin d,
2 = cos d + sin  sin d,

3 = d + cos d.

0 = q1 + 1/r dr,
1 = pr2 + r 1,
2 = pr2 + r 2,
3 = r r

(9)

because the taub-nut manifold is a hyperkahler 4-manifold, its curvature is anti-self-dual with

an appropriate choice of orientation.

when the higgs vacua is slightly misaligned, the two monopoles are attracted to each other
[10]. the eective low energy potential u of this static force has been found in ref. [6] for all
multimonopole congurations in all n = 4 gauge theories. specializing to the case of a pair of

distinct monopoles in su (3), the relative part of this potential is given by a squared norm of the

killing vector eld , up to an overall factor,

where a is a measure of higgs misalignment. the interacting part of the two monopole dynamics

certain dyonic states that preserve 1/4 of eld theory supersymmetries. the purpose of this note

is to reconstruct these 1/4 bps dyons as bps quantum bound states in the low energy dynamics

of monopoles.

3 supersymmetry and bps bound

we begin by recapitulating generic properties of the n=4 supersymmetric quantum extension of

the bosonic eective action [6, 11, 12]. its form is rather similar to the usual supersymmetric sigma

model action but supplemented by an attractive bosonic potential together with its fermionic

counter part. these potentials are determined by a single killing vector eld g. the supersym-

metric lagrangian written with real fermions is

l =

g gg  dg 5(cid:19),

r   

(12)

where  is a two-component anticommuting majorana spinor and 0 = 2, 5 = 3, and  = t 0.
in case of relative dynamics of the two su (3) monopoles, g is equal to a. as required for

the n=4 supersymmetry, the metric here is hyperkahler, endowed with three complex structures
i (a)

 (a = 1, 2, 3) that satisfy

i (a)i (b) = ab + abci (c),
di (a)

 = 0 .

(13)

(14)

for the sake of n=4 supersymmetry, the killing vector g  a k should be triholomorphic; namely
its action preserves the three complex structures via

lgi (a) = 0,

(15)

where l denotes the lie derivative.

upon quantization, the spinors a = ea

 , commute with all the bosonic
dynamical variables, especially with ps that are canonical momenta of the coordinates zs. the

  with vielbein ea

remaining canonical commutation relations are

[z, p ] = i
 ,
{a

the lagrangian (12) is invariant under the n=4 supersymmetry transformations,

it is easily checked that the central charge z indeed commutes with all susy generators.

for spectrum analysis, susy generators in complex form are more useful. introducing

it is easy to read o the bps condition for quantum states that preserves half of supersym-

metries. depending on the sign of central charge, we nd

(q  iq)|i = 0,

(35)

so that the given state may saturate the condition h = z. we can express this bps condition
in more geometrical fashion by transcribing the wavefunction to dierential forms on the moduli

space [13]. note that

furthermore, the wavefunction has the following general form,

|0i = 0.

with a inner product dened by

h|i = z dxgxp

(1p)1p

.

(39)

(40)

(41)

the coecients 1p are completely antisymmetric and may be regarded as those of a p-form.

in this language where we interpret  and  as a natural cobasis dz and a natural basis
z ,
one nds that the following replacement can be made:

i  d ,
g  ig ,

i  ,
iz  lg  dig + igd,

(42)

(43)

where ig denotes the natural contraction of the vector eld g with a dierential form. the bps

equation now becomes

(d  ig)  =  i(  g) ,

(44)

where we use the same symbol g for both the killing vector and the 1-form obtained by contraction

with metric. solving this rst order system, we should recover all 1/2 bps and 1/4 bps states of

the underlying yang-mills eld theory.

4 angular momentum and eigenstates on s3

4.1 supermultiplet structure of 1/4 bps dyons

1/4 bps dyons have been constructed in several dierence guises. the rst was as three-pronged

strings ending on d3 branes [1], while the eld theoretical construction was as exact classical

solitons [2, 3]. neither of these was convenient for nding their supermultiplet structures; there

are subtleties of the respective moduli space dynamics [14, 15]. the third method, also present

in ref. [2], was a perturbative one. in this setup, one assumes very small electric coupling and

work in vacua where the 1/4 bps dyons would be stable. the construction proceeds by nding the

lowest quantum excitation modes around purely magnetic background. the lowest are massless

moduli. the next lowest is massive, and turns out to induce quantized electric charges to the

system when excited, and produces many degenerate states with the same electromagnetic charges.

7

in the simplest case of  +  magnetic charge in su (3), the total degeneracy for dyons of relative
charge q 6= 0 is

26  |2q|.

(45)

note that q is quantized in half-integers. the highest spin of this supermultiplet is |q| + 1. the
relative charge dened through the following expression of electric charge one may excite on the

system,

q = (n + q)  + (n  q) .

(46)

where 2n is an integer. the consistency with dirac quantization condition, along with the spectrum
of the original eld theory, actually demands that n  q are integers. thus quantization of n is
correlated with that of the relative charge q: a half-integral q comes with a half-integral n, and an

integral q comes with an integral n.

when we reconstruct the dyons as bound states in the low energy dynamics, this correlation

naturally emerges from the form of total moduli space

m = r3 

r1  m0

z

,

(47)

where the quotient action of z is crucial. in this note, we will not dwell on this point. it suces

to say that all dyonic states of relative charge q can be built, provided that the relative part of the

wavefunction is found.

once we consider the wavefunction to be a tensor product of two parts, one over the relative

moduli space, and the other over the center-of-mass moduli space, the degeneracy is more naturally

organized as,

24 (cid:18)(2|q| + 1) + (2|q|) + (2|q|) + (2|q|  1)(cid:19).

(48)

the common factor 24 follows from the low energy dynamics trivially. among the low energy degree

of freedom, there are four bosonic and eight (real) fermionic coordinates that are associated with

the center-of-mass motion and thus free. these eight fermions acts as four pairs of massless har-
monic oscillators, whose excitations lead to 24 = 16 degeneracy and the subsequent supermultiplet

structure of n = 4 vector multiplet.

the rest of the degeneracy factors must arise from the relative part of the dynamics, as we

construct the 1/4 bps dyons as bound states of monopoles. as the above decomposition suggests,

the spin content of the supermultiplet found in ref. [2] is such that the bound state wavefunctions
over the relative moduli space are in four multiplets of angular momenta; one with l = |q|, two with
l = |q| 1/2, the last with l = |q| 1. thus, nding these bps bound states explicitly presupposes
detailed understanding of angular momentum in the low energy dynamics.

8

4.2 isometries and symmetries

let us recall the geometry of the taub-nut manifold. the metric is

(cid:18)1 +

1

r(cid:19) [dr2 + r22

1 + r22

2] +

1

1 + 1/r

2
3,

(49)

where the as are 1-form frame on s3 as in section 2. the taub-nut manifold has four killing
vectors, three of which generate su (2) rotation of s3. these su (2) killing vectors, which we

denote by la, are [16],

l1 =  sin    cot  cos   +
l2 = + cos    cot  sin   +
l3 = .

cos 
sin 
sin 
sin 

,

,

the as are easily seen to be invariant under the action of these vector elds:

the operator ja = illa satises the usual su (2) algebra.

lla(b) = 0.

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

the fourth killing vector corresponding to internal u (1) gauge rotations of monopoles, to be

denoted as k, is

k = .

(54)

this is precisely the triholomorphic killing vector eld that enters the low energy dynamics. this

vector eld do rotate 1 and 2 among themselves,

 ilk (1  i2) =  (1  i2),

(55)

but the taub-nut metric itself is invariant under such rotations. since the range of  is 4, the
eigenvalue of ilk is quantized at half-integers. its origin as a gauge rotation generator also tells
us that its eigenvalue should be identied with the relative charge q [9].

these isometries of the taub-nut manifold naturally generate symmetries of the low en-

ergy dynamics. in the absence of potential terms due to g = ak, this is especially clear since

the lagrangian is completely determined by the metric alone. furthermore, the geometrical in-
terpretation of the wavefunction |i as dierential form  suggests that these symmetries act on
 geometrically; in fact, it is easy to see that the noether charge associated with each of these

isometries do acts on wavefunctions/dierential forms as lie derivative. thus, for the rotational
su (2), the above operator ja may be regarded as the symmetry generators. and so is ilk for
the relative u (1) gauge symmetry.

9

symmetries generated by these vectors remain symmetries of the low energy dynamics when

we turn on the potential term determined by g = ak. this is guaranteed because las and k

preserves g:

however, the jas are not quite the physical angular momentum, it turns out. we will come back

ja(g) = 0 = lk(g).

(56)

to this crucial point shortly.

4.3 angular momentum on s3 and spin

as we observed from the known degeneracy of 1/4 bps dyons, the bound state with relative charge

q must have angular momentum that scales with q linearly. how do we realized such a multiplet?
note that the taub-nut space has the topology of r4 = r+  s3. on the s3, the su (2), which
itself is topologically s3, acts freely as translations, so functions on s3 naturally fall under various
su (2) representations. the angular momentum eigenfunctions on s3 are well-known to those
familiar with classic angular momentum theory, and are often denoted by dj

mk [17]. abstractly it
is dened as a nite rotation operator sandwiched between a pair of eigenstates of total angular

momentum j,

dj

mk(, , )  p2j + 1 hj; k|u (, , )|j; mi,

(57)

where we chose a normalization so that the norm is independent of j, m or k. the denition makes
it clear that m and k are bounded below and above by j,

j  m, k  j,

(58)

and separated from j in integer steps. for any xed k or m, the 2j + 1 functions indexed by m or

by k, would form a spin j multiplet of su (2)l or su (2)r, respectively, where the isometry group
of undeformed s3 is so(4) = su (2)l  su (2)r.

one might worry that the angular momentum eigenstates of our low energy dynamics may

have little to do with these d-functions. after all, a wavefunction should be regarded as a dierential

form whose transformation properties are generically more complicated than functions. however,
as we pointed out earlier, the taub-nut manifold admits orthonormal basis w, all four of which

are invariant under ja. this means that as long as we construct the wavefunction/dierential form
in the basis spanned by the orthonormal frame , its transformation property under ja originates
entirely from its coecient functions. thus we expect the generic form of the wavefunction could

be written as,

 = x dj

mk(, , ) j;k(r; dr, a),

10

(59)

where the dierential forms j;k have no explicit dependence on the three euler angles except
through the as. dj
mk with m = j,j + 1, . . . , j form a multiplet under ja with i charge k.

given the denition of d functions, it is not dicult to show that the other lower indices,
namely k, is an eigenvalue of the operator i. (because the actual geometry of the three sphere
is deformed, the su (2) under which dj
mk, k = j,j + 1, . . . , j would have formed a representation
is no longer a symmetry.) since j is bounded below by |k|, a large relative charge necessarily implies
a large angular momentum; the degeneracy has to scale linearly with increasing k  q. this is
precisely the behavior we saw from the state counting of subsection 4.1.

however, there is something missing. given a single eigenstate , we expect to generate other

physical states related to it by acting with a susy charge, say q. the underlying eld theory
tells us the new state q|i must be fermionic/bosonic if |i is bosonic/fermionic. in particular
their physical spin should dier by 1/2. on the other hand, q itself is invariant under the action
of ja = illa, and cannot impart additional angular momentum quantum numbers, it seems.

the resolution of this dilemma is that we should modify the angular momentum operator

by adding a spin piece. the hyperkahler structure of the taub-nut manifold supplies such
additional conserved quantities, fortunately [18]. let i (a) be the three complex structures as
before. dene a triplet of operators sa acting on fermions by,

the pointwise action is, in geometrical terms,

sa =

i
2i (a)

  .

sa(dz) =

sa(cid:18) 

z(cid:19) =

2i (a)
2i (a) 

i

i

 dz,

 (cid:18) 

z(cid:19) ,

(60)

(61)

(62)

which is nothing but the action of the three complex structures i (a) up to a numerical factor. these
sas span an su (2) r-symmetry of the n = 4 superalgebra.

the sas themselves form a triple under the jas, and using this fact we may write down a

new set of angular momentum generators,

which also span an su (2) algebra. note that, unlike ja, ma commute with the r-charges sa.

ma  ja  sa,

(63)

we seem to have two possible choices of angular momentum; ja which rotate r-charge and

ma which do not. both commute with the hamiltonian, but their commutators with supercharges

11

are quite dierent matter. under ja, the four complex supercharges fall into a singlet plus a triplet,

i.e.

[ja, q] = 0,

[ja, q(b)] = iabcq(c) .

(64)

on the other hand, since the four complex supercharges belong to doublets under sa, they must

form doublets under ma as well. more specically, the following linear combinations

q+ = q + iq(3),
q = iq(1) + q(2),

form one doublet under ma with [s3, q] =  1

2 q, and the second combination

q+ = iq(1)  q(2),
q = q  iq(3),

(65)

(66)

form another doublet under ma with [s3, q] = + 1
q. since supercharges should carry phys-
ical spin 1/2, we surmise that ma rather than ja should be interpreted as the physical angular
momentum. we will denote the eigenvalues of m 2 by l(l + 1).

4.4 anti-self-dual ansatz

now we may proceed to write down the ansatz for dyonic bps bound states. the bps equation

is easily seen to be invariant under the hodge dual operation on the wavefunction. this property

can be used to separate the self-dual part from the anti-self-dual part of the trial wavefunction, so

a bps wavefunction should be either self-dual or anti-self-dual.

does the dynamics prefer one to the other? hamiltonian has three kinds of potential terms.
in addition to the purely bosonic potential g2, there are two more terms; one is a fermion bilinear

contracted with dg, while the other is a fermion quadrilinear contracted with the riemann cur-

vature. the salient point is that dg and the riemann curvature are both anti-self-dual tensors

on taub-nut manifold. because of this, a self-dual ansatz will not be sensitive to some spin-spin

type long range interaction, which could be crucial for the formation of bound states. in fact, the

threshold bound state of su (3) monopoles (when g = 0) is known to be anti-self-dual, while no

such self-dual bound state exists [9]. we expect that this behavior persists when g = ak is turned
on, which motivates us to look for 1/4 bps dyonic bound states with an anti-self-dual ansatz4

let us start with anti-self-dual 2-forms. one interesting property of anti-self-dual 2-forms on

hyperkahler 4-manifolds, is that they are of type (1, 1), upon hodge decompositions with respect

4 nonetheless, there is no reason to preclude self-dual bound states that do not saturate the bps bound.

to any one of three complex structures [19]. recall that, up to a numerical factor, the spin sa

act on dierential forms as complex structures do. since any form of type (n, n) is annihilated by

the complex structure, we conclude that the 2-form part of an anti-self-dual ansatz carries no spin.

on the other hand, the bps equation connects even forms with even forms, so an ansatz

containing anti-self-dual 2-form may contain, in addition, 0-form and 4-form. neither carries spin:

0-form is obviously invariant under sa, and a 4-form is always proportional to the volume form

which is always of type (n, n). thus, an anti-self-dual even form is always spinless; l equals j.

the angular dependence of anti-self-dual even forms can be written entirely in terms of d functions

and of the basis as.

of the four angular momentum multiplets, the cases of l = q  0 and of l = q  1  0 belong

to this category. for l = q, the wavefunction should have the form,

q

m;q = dq

mqq;q + dq

m(q1)q;q1,

(67)

for any value of m = q, q  1, . . . ,q, where dierential forms s can be written entirely with r
and  only. this state has relative charge q  0 if and only if the anti-self-dual form s satisfy
(68)

 ilkq;q = 0,

ilkq;q1 = q;q1.

since the only charged combination one can build out of r and  is 1  i2, which has 1 charge
respectively, the s may contribute 1 to the total charge q at most. furthermore, only  + i2
may enter since dq

m(q+1), which should accompany   i2, does not exist for positive q.

these considerations constrain possible form of s quite severely. we nd that only the

following choice is consistent with the known quantum numbers of 1/4 bps dyons,

q;q = f (r) + h(r) (0  3 + 1  2) + f (r) (0  1  2  3),

q;q1 = (b(r)/r) (0 + i3)  (1 + i2),

(69)

(70)

for l = q  0 bps state.5

in case of l = q  1 with q  1, the anti-self-dual ansatz is even more restrictive. the only

such ansatz consistent with known quantum numbers is,

m;q = p(r) dq1
q1

m(q1) (0 + i3)  (1 + i2),

(71)

for m = q  1, q  2, . . . , 1  q. no 0-form may appear since a factor of (1 + i2) is necessary to
make the electric charge to be q, while 4-form is ruled out subsequently by the fact that the bps

wavefunctions we are looking for are all anti-self-dual.

we will postpone discussion of the two remaining multiplets of l = q1/2  0 to the following
section. the corresponding multiplets are in odd forms, which can be found by acting supercharges
on q

m;q . for these two multiplets, sa contribution to the physical angular momentum

m;q and q1

does not vanish.

5 dyonic bps bound states

here, we will solve for the dyonic bps bound states explicitly. such dyonic bound state do not
exist for all relative charge q. rather, it is known that |q| must be smaller than the critical charge
|qcr| [1, 2, 15], where

(72)

qcr = lim
r

ahk, ki.

with our current normalization, hk, ki asymptotes to 1 at innity, so the critical charge qcr is
equal to the parameter a. thus we expect to nd the bps bound state, that is, a normalizable
and regular wavefunction that preserves half of low energy supersymmetry, only when |q|  |a|.
without loss of generality, we will take both a and q to be nonnegative.

classical analysis of ref. [1, 2] leaves it unclear whether the bound state should exist (at

threshold) when a = q. classically two monopoles are innitely separated, but quantum mechan-

ically, there may be a bound state with powerlike decay. as the following analysis will show,

however, no such threshold bound state exists, except for a = q = 0 case.

5.1 the l = q  1 multiplet

the case of l = q  1 is the simplest. starting with the ansatz,

m;q = p(r) dq1
q1

m,q1 (0 + i3)  (1 + i2),

the bps equation reduces to a single ordinary dierential equation for p(r),

where the quantity a is dened to be the following combination:

d
dr

r p(r) = a(r) r p(r),

a useful fact we employed is that

a  a  q(cid:18)1 +

1

er (0 + i3)  (1 + i2)

14

(73)

(74)

(75)

(76)

is a (nonnormalizable) harmonic 2-form. the equation is easily solved to give the wavefunction:

m;q = dq1
q1

m(q1)rq1e(aq)r (0 + i3)  (1 + i2).

(77)

the wavefunction is exponentially small at large r and normalizable as long as a > q. this way,

we have recovered the fact that a is the critical electric charge, beyond which no bound state may
exist. furthermore, the wavefunction is regular as long as q  1, which is also consistent with the
fact that l = q  1 bps bound state exists only for q  1.

5.2 the l = q multiplet

the ansatz for l = q  0 is a bit more involved;

q;q = dq

+ dq

mq(cid:16)f (r) + h(r) (0  3 + 1  2) + f (r) (0  3  1  2)(cid:17)
m(q1)(cid:16)(b(r)/r) (0 + i3)  (1 + i2)(cid:17) ,

under which bps equations reduce to

d

f = ah +

b
r2 ,

d
dr

h +

2h

1 + r

= af 

b
r2 ,

d
dr

b + ab = q(f  h).

in order to solve (79) for general q > 0, we proceed as follows. by substituting,

f = u(r)er a,

h = v(r)er a,

b = w(r)(cid:18) q

a(cid:19) er a,

to (79), one obtains,

(u  w) = 0,

d

d

(1 + r)2v = 0,

d
dr

(w/a) = u  v .

(78)

(79)

(80)

(81)

we solve the rst equation by u = c1 +w with an integration constant c1. the remaining equations

can be combined into a single second order equation,

d

dr (cid:20) d

dr (cid:18) (1 + r)w

a

(cid:19)  2a(cid:18) (1 + r)w

a

(cid:19)  2c1r(cid:21) = 0,

which is integrated with a second integration constant c2 to

d

dr (cid:18) (1 + r)w

a

(cid:19)  2a(cid:18) (1 + r)w

a

(cid:19) = +2c1r  2c2.

(82)

(83)

integrating this equation gives us three-parameter family of solutions. but, fortunately, the simplest

possible solution,

(1 + r)w

a

= r,

15

(84)

turns out to be the only regular and normalizable solution. using it to generate other radial

functions, we nd the l = q bound states:

q

m;q = dq

mq

rqe(aq)r

1 + r
rqe(aq)r

(cid:20)a + (a +

1

1 + r

)(0  3 + 1  2) + a 0  1  2  3)(cid:21)

 dq

m(q1)

1 + r qq/2 (0 + i3)  (1 + i2).

(85)

again, we nd that the wavefunction is normalizable as long as a > q. the solution is regular at

origin for all nonnegative q. we have recovered the l = q multiplet of 1/4 bps dyon of charge

q > 0.

the case of q = 0 is a bit special, where the bps state is a purely magnetic bound state of

the two monopoles. for q = 0, the second d function does not exist, and we must solve a modied

bps equation. nevertheless, the actual wavefunction is also obtained by taking q = 0 limit of the

above result:

0

0;0 =

ear

1 + r (cid:20)a + (a +

1

1 + r

)(0  3 + 1  2) + a 0  1  2  3)(cid:21) .

(86)

this bps state actually preserves all supercharges of low energy dynamics.

in fact, this is the

lowest lying state of this low energy eective theory. in the limit of aligned vacua (a = 0), this

state also reverts to the threshold bound state of two monopoles found in ref. [9], as it should.

5.3 the l = q  1/2 multiplets

the remaining two multiplets of l = q  1/2 can be found most easily by acting q on q
q1
m;q found above. from q1

m;q and

m;q , we nd 2q  1 states
rqe(aq)r
r + r2
m;q produces 2q + 1 states

(1 + i2)  (1 + 0  3)dq1

m(q1),

while q

rqe(aq)r

r + r2 h(0 +i3)  (1+1  2)p2qdq

mq + i(1 +i2)  (1+0  3)dq

m(q1)i.

these account for all 4q states in the two l = q  1/2 multiplets. (alternatively we could have used
m;q are invariant under complex structures, and since q(a) are
q(a) instead of q. since q1
essentially q rotated by the complex structures, the resulting 4q states will be simply the above 4q
states with complex structure ia acting on them.)

m;q and q

(87)

(88)

however, because q is a singlet under ja, the above states form multiplets under ja instead

of the physical angular momentum ma. to reconstruct ma multiplets, we recall the relationship

ja = ma + sa

16

(89)

since the two su (2) generators, ma and sa, commute with each other, ja multiplets are constructed

from m multiplets and s multiplets by the rule of angular momentum addition. on the other hand,

we actually need to reconstruct ma eigenstates from ja and sa eigenstates, for which we need to
reverse the procedure. without delving into details of the computation, we present the two l = q 1
2
multiplets. because s3 commutes with ma, we can label the two multiplets by its eigenvalue s3.

the rst has s3 = 1/2;

in a direct construction of these two l = q  1

5.4 characteristics of the bps states

in the construction of the bps bound states, we have limited ourselves to the case of nonnegative

electric charge. for negatively charged bound states, we note the fact that the complex conjugation

of a solution to the bps equations in (44), gives another solution. both the eigenvalues of charge

and m3 reverse their signs under the complex conjugation. thus the negatively charged solution,
m;q (q  0) is simply given by the complex conjugation of l
l

m;q.

we now turn to the case that the higgs misalignment parameter a is negative. when a is
replaced by a, only the fermionic term that couples to the killing potential changes its sign in

17

hri  h|r|i
h|i

(93)

the supersymmetric lagrangian (12). by the parity operation   i0 or equivalently   i,
one can bring this lagrangian to the original form with a > 0. the corresponding transformation
amounts to replacement of dx by idx. the solutions for a are obtained if one replaces all 
of the above bps solutions by i. these exhaust all the possibilities.

for the remainder of the section, we would like to comment briey on some other aspects of

the bps states. with an excited charge q, the eective potential at large relative separation tends
to (a2 + q2)/2. since the energy eigenvalue of the bps multiplets is |aq|, one nds that binding
energy of the dyons is

which tends to zero as the charge approach its critical value, as one expects from its classical

ebinding =

(|a|  |q|)2

2

,

(92)

counterpart. another characteristic is the separation of the two monopole cores. in the classical
limit, the separation between the two cores are given by req  |q|/(|a||q|). we expect the vacuum
expectation value,

to approach req in the classical limit. for a given supermultiplet with charge q, the expectation

values are found to be dependent upon the angular momentum quantum number l. for instance,

we nd the expectation value

hri =

|q|

(|a|  |q|)(cid:18)1 +

1

2|a|(cid:19) = req (cid:18)1 +

1

2|a|(cid:19) ,

for the l = |q|  1 multiplet, and

hri =

|q|

(|a|  |q|) (cid:18)1 +

1

2|q|(cid:19) = req (cid:18)1 +

1

2|q|(cid:19) ,

(94)

(95)

for the l = |q|  1/2 multiplets. to restore the planck constant h, we simply observe that classical
charge q has the same dimension as h. since the dierence between hri and req scales inversely
with q or a = qcr, it has to scale linearly with h:

hri  req

req

 o(h) .

(96)

thus, hri indeed approaches req = |q|/(|a|  |q|) in the classical limit.

6 conclusion

in the low energy dynamics of 1/2 bps monopoles, the misaligned higgs vacua induces an attractive

potential between monopoles of distinct types. this potential is crucial in formation of new dyonic

18

bound states of monopoles, some of which preserve 1/4 of supersymmetries in eld theoretical

sense, or equivalently, 1/2 of supersymmetries of the low energy dynamics of monopoles. starting

from the full n=4 supersymmetric low energy eective lagrangian, we expressed the bps equation

of the system in the language of the dierential form, which was then further reduced to a set of

coupled rst-order ordinary dierential equations. these equations were solved analytically, giving

1/4 bps dyons as quantum bound states of two distinct su(3) monopoles. along the course of

the construction, we have given a full account of the supermultiplet structures of the quantum 1/4

bps dyons.

in this note, we have focused on the bps saturated states in pursuit of the 1/4 bps dyons.

however, it is expected that there exist spectra of other dyonic bound states that do not saturate the

bps bound. problem of nding these non-bps bound states should be quite involved. nevertheless,

there are some additional information that might be of help. supersymmetric sigma models on

the taub-nut geometry are known to allow additional conserved quantities of the runge-lenz

type [16, 18].

it seems quite plausible that this new symmetry generalize to the present low

energy dynamics with potential. we have checked that the purely bosonic part indeed admits such

conserved quantities. such additional symmetries might be useful in nding the excited non-bps

bound states.

another aspect of the dynamics we did not discuss here is the scattering of dyons. the

supersymmetric quantum mechanics we used can be thought of low energy dynamics for 1/4 bps

dyons in two ways. first, it produces these dyons as bound states. second, it provides a frame-

work where interaction among these dyons can be studied in a quantum mechanical setting. the

dynamics is admittedly more involved than the usual moduli space dynamics, given the presence

of the potential. it requires further study.
