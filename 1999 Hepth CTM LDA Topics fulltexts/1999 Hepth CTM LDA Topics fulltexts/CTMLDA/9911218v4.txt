abstract

we study some aspects of dilatonic domain walls in relation to the idea on the
noncompact internal space. we nd that the warp factor in the spacetime metric
increases as one moves away from the domain wall for all the supersymmetric dilatonic
domain wall solutions obtained from the (intersecting) bps branes in string theories
through toroidal compactications, unlike the case of the randall-sundrum model.
on the other hand, when the dilaton coupling parameter a for the d-dimensional
extreme dilatonic domain wall takes the values a2 < 4/(d  2)2, the kaluza-klein
spectrum of graviton has the same structure as that of the randall-sundrum model
(and the warp factor decreases in the nite interval around the dilatonic domain wall),
thereby implying the possibility of extending the randall-sundrum model to the a2 <
4/(d  2)2 case. we construct fully localized solutions describing extreme dilatonic
branes within extreme dilatonic domain walls and the supersymmetric branes within
the supersymmetric domain walls of string theories. these solutions are valid in any
region of spacetime, not just in the region close to the domain walls.

1 introduction

it was kaluza [1] who showed that the einsteins theory of four-dimensional gravity and
the maxwells theory of electromagnetism can be unied within the ve-dimensional
theory of general relativity. in his derivation of his model, kaluza avoided the question
of unobservableness of such extra fth coordinate simply by assuming that all the elds
do not depend on the extra coordinates. later, klein [2] explained the unobservableness
of and the independence of physical quantities on the extra coordinate by assuming
the extra spatial dimension to be too small to be observed. namely, if one assumes
the extra dimension to be a compact manifold, i.e., a circle in the klein case, then
all the elds can be fourier-expanded and the fourier coecients are identied as
elds in compactied lower dimensions. since mass scale of such fourier modes, called
the kaluza-klein (kk) modes, is inversely proportional to the size of compactication
manifold, if the size of the manifold becomes very small, then the extra massive kk
modes become too heavy to be observed. so, in the limit of very small compactication
manifold, one can eectively keep only zero modes of the kk spectrum, thereby leading
to the original kaluzas assumption that the physical quantities simply do not depend
on the extra coordinate.

this idea of klein has been dominantly taken within particle physics, including
the kk supergravity theories and superstring theories. however, the problem with
the kleins idea on small extra space is that it cannot explain why the extra space
has to be markedly dierent in topology and in size. one of alternative approaches
which attempt to address this problem assumes that the extra space is on the same
footing as our four-dimensional spacetime, namely the elds depend on the extra space
which is now assumed to have innite extend just like our four-dimensional spacetime
or to be not very small. however, the challenge of this approach is to explain why
the extra space has not been observed. to avoid this diculty, it was argued that
particles are trapped inside of the four-dimensional hypersurface by a potential well
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] or for topological reason [12]. this idea was also proposed
in an attempt to explain smallness of cosmological constant in our four-dimensional
universe [5, 6, 7] and to bring chiral fermions [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] into the theory,
which is not achievable from the conventional kk theory with compact internal space.
this old idea on noncompact extra space recently has received revived attention,
after it was found out [20, 21, 22] by randall and sundrum (rs) that such approach
can also be applied to solve the hierarchy problem of particle physics.
in the rs
model, our four-dimensional world is regarded as a non-dilatonic 3-brane embedded
in ve-dimensional spacetime.
in the rs model, the potential due to gravity is re-
pulsive, unlike the case of the previous works on trapping of matter inside of the
four-dimensional hypersurface as discussed in the previous paragraph, because of the

1

(exponentially) decreasing (rather than increasing) warp factor in the spacetime met-
ric. this exponentially decreasing warp factor makes the trapping of the gravity inside
of the four-dimensional hypersurface possible. in fact, it is also shown that such model
with noncompact extra space reproduces [9, 21] newtons 1/r2 law of four-dimensional
gravity with experimentally unobservable correction from the (extremely suppressed)
contribution of the continuum of massive kk modes [21].

the ansatz for the ve-dimensional spacetime metric used in the rs model is the
one with the warp factor, where the four-dimensional part has the conformal factor
depending on the extra spatial coordinate. so, such metric can also be regarded as the
metric of ve-dimensional non-dilatonic domain wall, which is supported by the cos-
mological constant in ve-dimensions. in this paper, we consider the case of dilatonic
domain walls, where the cosmological constant term in the action is multiplied by the
dilaton factor, with an arbitrary dilaton coupling parameter a in any spacetime dimen-
sions d. (some aspects of dilatonic generalization of the rs model are also studied, for
example, in refs. [23, 24, 25].) we study trapping of matter near the domain wall and
the kk spectrum of the graviton in the dilatonic domain wall background. we nd
that for the supersymmetric dilatonic domain walls that can be obtained by toroidally
compactifying the (intersecting) bps branes in string theories, the warp factor in the
metric increases as one moves away from the domain wall. so, the rs-type scenario
cannot be realized within such dilatonic domain walls. this is along the same line
as the previous works on supergravity embeddings [26, 27, 28, 29] of the rs model.
namely, the bps domain wall solutions in ve-dimensional supergravity theories that
have been constructed so far have exponentially increasing warp factor (as oppose to
the exponentially decreasing warp factor of the rs model) 2. this is shown explicitly
rst time in ref. [29] within domain wall solutions in ve-dimensional gauged n = 2
supergravity. on the other hand, we nd that when the dilaton coupling parameter
takes the values a2 < 4(d  1)/(d  2)2 the warp factor decreases in nite inter-
val around the domain wall. particularly when a2 < 4/(d  2)2, the potential term
in the schrodinger equation describing the small uctuation of the spacetime metric
around the minkowski sub-spacetime takes the qualitatively same form as that of the
rs model, thereby implying the possibility of the extension of the rs model to the
a2 < 4/(d2)2 case. note, this cannot be obtained from the (intersecting) bps branes
in string theories through toroidal compactications. we also construct fully localized
solutions describing various extreme solitons living inside of the dilatonic domain walls,
by applying the formalism studied in ref. [30]. these solutions are valid for any region
in spacetime, not just in the region close to the domain walls.

2i would like to thank prof. kallosh for bringing this point to my attention and giving suggestions
for better presentation of the results in this paper, after the rst version of the paper appeared on the
preprint archive.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we discuss aspects of dilatonic domain
wall solution, especially in relation to the idea on noncompact internal space. in section
3, we construct fully localized solutions describing extreme dilatonic branes within the
extreme dilatonic domain walls. in section 4, we construct fully localized supergravity
solutions describing the bps branes within the bps domain walls in string theories.

2 dilatonic domain walls

in this section, we discuss solution for a general dilatonic domain wall in d-dimensional
spacetime and its role as an alternative to the conventional kk theory with noncompact
internal space.

we start by summarizing a general dilatonic p-brane solution in d spacetime di-
mensions, since we are interested in obtaining solutions describing branes inside of the
worldvolume of domain walls. the einstein-frame action for the dilatonic p-brane with
the dilaton coupling parameter ap in d spacetime dimensions is

where d is the d-dimensional einstein gravitational constant,  is the dilaton, fp+2 =
dap+1 is the eld strength of the (p + 1)-form potential ap+1. the solution to the
eld equations of the einstein-frame action (1) for the extreme dilatonic p-brane
with the longitudinal coordinates x = (x1, ..., xp) and the transverse coordinates y =
(y1, ..., ydp1) located at y = 0 has the following form:

for general values of the dilaton coupling parameter ap, the extreme solution (2)
is not supersymmetric. only the extreme solutions with the specic values of the
dilaton coupling parameter ap are supersymmetric. for the consistently truncated
supergravity action of the form (1) obtained by compactifying the eleven-dimensional
supergravity on (s1)11d has the dilaton coupling ap such that p = 4/n with a
positive integer n [31, 32]. here, the eld strength fp+2 is a linear combination of n
original (p + 2)-form eld strengths with the same page charges and the dilaton  is
a linear-combination of the original (dilatonic) scalars. the extreme dilatonic p-brane

3

solution (2) with p = 4/n preserves at least 2n of the maximal symmetry.
in
other words, all the dilatonic p-brane solutions obtained by toroidally compactifying
intersecting n numbers of bps branes in string theories with equal charges have the
form (2) with p = 4/n. note, in this case, the dilaton  in eqs. (1) and (2) is
rather a linear combination of the dilaton and other scalars in string theory.

the dilatonic domain wall with the dilaton coupling parameter a in d spacetime
dimensions corresponds to the p = d2 case of the general dilatonic p-brane discussed
in the above. namely, a domain wall in d spacetime dimensions can be regarded as a
(d2)-brane, electrically charged under the (d1)-form potential ad1. by applying
a poincare dualization, one can replace the d-form eld strength fd = dad1 by the
cosmological constant . so, the action (1) with p = d  2 can be rewritten as

here, the parameter q in the harmonic function h is related to the cosmological

(7)

as mentioned in the previous paragraph, the supersymmetric 3 dilatonic domain wall
solution (5) that can be obtained by compactifying (intersecting) bps branes in string
theories on a torus has  = 4/n. on the other hand, one can also obtain supersym-
metric dilatonic domain wall solutions through dierent compactication procedure.
for example, by compactifying the supersymmetric d-dimensional dilatonic p-brane
action (1) with p = 4/n on sdp2 [33, 34], one has the action (4) with a and 
given by:

|a| =

2(d  2)  n(p + 1)(d  p  3)
2(d  p  2)  n(d  p  3)

3strictly speaking, supersymmetry nature of domain wall solutions cannot be fully answered until
one considers full supergravity action with non-constant dilaton eld (which makes the wall) and the
explicit form of superpotential.

(8)

here, d in eqs. (4)  (6) is given by d = p + 2 for this type of compactication.

note, unlike the case of other type of branes, one can always remove the constant
term in the above harmonic function h for the domain wall by applying the coordinate
translation along the y-direction, and the solution can be written with dierent powers
of harmonic function through the coordinate transformations [35]. in this paper we
choose the transverse coordinate such that the solution has the standard form that
would be obtained by taking the p = d  2 limit of dilatonic p-brane solutions.

in general, matter in the d-dimensional spacetime with the following form of metric

with the warp factor w (z):

gdxdx = w (z)hdt2 + dx2

(9)
is trapped inside of the (d 1)-dimensional sub-spacetime with the coordinates (x) =
(t, x1, ..., xd2) for a suitable form of the warp factor w (z). to see [6] this classically, we
consider a particle with the d-momentum p = (p 0, p i, p z) moving in this spacetime.
the killing vectors for this spacetime are /t and /xi (i = 1, ..., d  2). so, the
constants of motion for the particle are

d2i + dz2

1 +    + dx2

e =  p,
pi =  p,

t!
t! = p g   
xi!
xi! = p g   





= p 0w (z),

= p iw (z).

the invariant mass m of the particle in this spacetime is dened as

m 2 = p gp  = w (z)(p 0)2 + w (z)(p i)2 + (p z)2.

(10)

(11)

therefore, the momentum p z of the particle in the direction z of the extra space is
given by

p z = qe2w 1  m 2  p2w 1,

(12)
where p = (pi). the particle is trapped within the (d 1)-dimensional spacetime, i.e.,
the motion of the particle along the z-direction is restricted inside of a nite interval
around z = 0, if the energy e of the particle is bounded above by the potential due to
gravity:

one can bring the spacetime metric in eq. (5) for the dilatonic domain wall to the

e < qm 2w (z) + p2.

(13)

form (9) by redening the transverse coordinate in the following way:

z = sgn(y)

q1(cid:20)(1 + q|y|)

4

a2(d2)2  1(cid:21) .

(14)

then, the dilatonic domain wall metric takes the form (9) with the warp factor given
by

w (z) =  1 +

this warp factor for the dilatonic domain wall metric monotonically increases as one
moves away from the wall and goes to innity as |z|  , if a2 > 4(d  1)/(d  2)2,
(note, this case includes the supersymmetric dilatonic domain walls
i.e.,  > 0.
obtained from the (intersecting) bps branes in string theories through toroidal com-
pactications, in which  = 4/n.) so, matter inside of d-dimensional spacetime of
the dilatonic domain wall will always be trapped within the (d  1)-dimensional sub-
spacetime by gravity, even if the extra space with the coordinate z can have an innite
extend. this mechanism provides with an alternative to the ordinary kk theories
where the spacetime is assumed to be of the form of the direct product md  k of the
d-dimensional spacetime md and some compact space k. on the other hand, when
a2 < 4(d 1)/(d 2)2, i.e.,  < 0, the warp factor w (z) decreases at a nite interval
|z| < [4(d  1)/(a2(d  2)2)  1]q1 around the domain wall, thereby providing with
the repulsive potential to matter. (note, in this case, the spacetime metric (9) with the
warp factor (15) is not well-dened in the region |z| > [4(d 1)/(a2(d 2)2) 1]q1.)
however, in this case gravity is trapped within the domain wall for suciently small
values of , i.e.,  < 2, as will be discussed in the following.

this trapping of matter due to gravitational potential well can also be seen [10]
by considering the klein-gordon equation 2 = m 2 for a massive scalar  in
if we let
the background of dilatonic domain wall (9) with the warp factor (15).
 = w (3d)/2(z)(x), then the above klein-gordon equation takes the following form
of the klein-gordon equation for a scalar (x) in (d  1)-dimensional at spacetime
with varying mass as one moves along the direction perpendicular to the domain wall:

 = (cid:20)m 2w (z) +

d  3

2

w (z)(cid:21) ,

(16)

where the prime denotes derivative with respect to z. so, if a2 > 4(d1)/(d2)2, i.e.,
 > 0, then the mass of the (d  1)-dimensional scalar (x) increases as one moves
away from the domain wall, implying that the scalar  is in the attractive potential well
centered around z = 0. when a2 < 4(d 1)/(d 2)2, i.e.,  < 0, the minimum of the
potential well is rather away from the wall, i.e., at |z| = [4(d1)/(a2(d2)2)1]q1,

6

which moves away from the domain wall as the dilaton coupling parameter a approaches
zero. this implies the repulsive potential for the a2 < 4(d  1)/(d  2)2 case. as we
will discuss in the following paragraph, this critical value a2 = 4(d1)/(d2)2 for the
dilaton coupling parameter also corresponds to the critical value below [above] which
the -function potential in the schrodinger equation satised by the metric perturbation
becomes attractive [repulsive]. namely, when a2 > 4(d  1)/(d  2)2, i.e.,  > 0, the
minimum of the potential well for a massive particle or massive scalar is located at the
domain wall (therefore, matter is trapped due to the attractive potential well) and the
-function potential in the schrodinger equation becomes an innite barrier, but when
a2 < 4(d  1)/(d  2)2, i.e.,  < 0, the minima of the potential well is located away
from the domain wall (therefore, the potential becomes repulsive) and the -function
potential in the schrodinger equation becomes attractive.

in the following, we study the kk spectrum of graviton in the dilatonic domain wall
background. we consider the following general metric describing the small uctuation
h(x, u) of the (d  1)-dimensional minkowski sub-spacetime of the conformally at
d-dimensional spacetime of the dilatonic domain wall:

gdxdx = (u)h( + h) dxdx + du2i ,

(17)

where |h|  1. the conformally at form of the spacetime metric (eq. (17) with
h = 0) can be achieved from the dilatonic domain wall metric in eq. (5) by applying
the following coordinate transformation:

u = sgn(y)

(24)

this kk potential expression has the similar form as that of the non-dilatonic domain
wall of the rs model up to the coecients. however, there are some qualitative
dierences in the kk modes depending on the signs of the coecients in the kk
potential (24). in the following, we discuss properties of the kk spectrum for dierent
values of  or a.

  < 2 case, i.e., a2 < 4/(d  2)2: the coecient in the rst term of the kk
potential is positive, the coecient of the -function term is negative and the
coecient in front of |u| in the rst term of the kk potential is positive, just as
in the case of the rs model (a = 0 case). so, the kk spectrum consists of a
single normalizable bound state zero mode (identied as the (d 1)-dimensional
graviton) due to the attractive -function potential and the continuum of massive
kk modes which asymptote to plane waves as |u|   (since v (u)  0 as
|u|  ) and are suppressed as the origin is approached (due to the potential
barrier near u = 0). this implies that the rs model can be extended to the a2 <
4/(d  2)2 case. this case cannot be achieved through toroidal compactication
of intersecting bps branes in string theories (since  = 4/n for this case), but
can be achieved through the combined toroidal and spherical compactications
(when n(d  p 3) > 2), as can be seen from  in eq. (8). however, the issues
on supersymmetry of such dilatonic domain walls cannot be fully answered until
one considers corresponding full gauged supergravity theory.

8

 2 <  < 1 case, i.e., 4/(d  2)2 < a2 < 2d/(d  2)2: the signs of the
coecients are the same as the above case except the coecient in front of |u|,
which now becomes negative. so, the rst term in the kk potential (24) has the
positive minimum at |z| = 0 and increases monotonically, approaching innity
as |u| = q1/( + 2) is reached. in this case, one rather has discrete bound
states of massive modes with mass gap.

 1 <  < 0 case, i.e., 2d/(d  2)2 < a2 < 4(d  1)/(d  2)2: the coecient
of the rst term in the kk potential becomes negative and the coecient in
front of |u| becomes negative, whereas the coecient in the -function term still
remains negative. so, the rst term in the kk potential has negative maximum
at |z| = 0 and decreases monotonically, approaching negative innity as |u| =
q1/( + 2) is reached. in addition to the continuum of massive modes, now
there are therefore the continuum of tachyonic modes, implying the instability.

  > 0 case, i.e., a2 > 4(d 1)/(d 2)2: this case includes the case of  = 4/n,
i.e., dilatonic domain walls obtained from the (intersecting) bps branes in string
theories through toroidal compactications. the coecient in the rst term is
negative, the coecient in front of |u| is positive and the coecient in the -
function term becomes now positive. the rst term in the kk potential has
the negative minimum at z = 0 and increases monotonically, approaching zero
as |z|  . so, in this case, now we have discrete bound states of tachyonic
modes, in addition to the continuum of massive modes without mass gap. the
repulsive -function potential at the origin provides with innite potential barrier
at u = 0. as mentioned previously, this case also corresponds to the case in which
matter is trapped within the (d1)-dimensional sub-spacetime by the attractive
potential well due to the gravity. so, dilatonic domain walls obtainable from the
(intersecting) bps branes in string theories through toroidal compactication
just traps matter inside the domain wall without providing with the rs-type
scenario.

3 extreme dilatonic branes inside of extreme dila-

tonic domain walls

in this section, we construct fully localized solutions describing extreme dilatonic branes
within the worldvolume of extreme dilatonic domain walls. schematically, the cong-
urations under consideration are given by the following table:

here, t is the time coordinate, w = (w1, ..., wp) is the overall longitudinal coordinates,
x = (x1, ..., xdp2) is the relative transverse coordinates for the brane and y is the
overall transeverse coordinate. these notations for the coordinates will be followed in
this and the next sections.

such brane congurations are described by the theory which contains the d-dimensional

graviton ge
 (,  = 0, 1, ..., d  1), the dilaton , (p + 1)-form potential ap+1 with the
eld strength fp+2 = dap+1, which p-brane (p < d  2) couples to, and the (d  1)-
form potential ad1, whose eld strength fd = dad1 dualizes to the cosmological
constant term which supports domain wall solution. the einstein-frame action which
describes such theory has the following form:

a general solution for the harmonic function h to the second equation in eq. (28)
has the form h = 1 + q|y|. however, by applying the coordinate translation y

note, we have seen in the previous section that matter is trapped within the dilatonic
domain wall when  > 0 and the rs model can be extended to the  < 2 case. so,
fully localized solutions, presented in this section, describes an extreme brane inside of
a dilatonic domain wall which traps matter [which generalizes the rs model] when the
dilaton coupling parameter a is such that  > 0 [ < 2]. the former case includes
the supersymmetric dilatonic domain walls with  = 4/n, which are obtained from
the (intersecting) bps branes in string theories through toroidal compactications.

4 bps solitons inside of bps domain walls in string

theories

in this section, we construct fully localized supergravity solutions describing the bps
solitons inside of the bps domain walls which are obtained by compactifying intersect-
ing branes in string theories. we shall compactify various partially localized intersect-
ing bps brane solutions constructed in ref. [30] to obtain such supergravity solutions.
because the congurations considered in this section (and also those considered in the
previous section) describe branes inside of another brane and the dimensionality of the
overall transverse space is suciently small, the corresponding supergravity solutions
are completely localized. moreover, these solutions describe the eld congurations in
the region at arbitrary distance from the domain walls.

generally, the einstein-frame action for a brane in string theory has the following

form:

where ge
m n (m, n = 0, 1, ..., 9) is the einstein-frame spacetime metric,  is the ten-
dimensional dilaton and fp+2 is the eld strength of the (p + 1)-form potential ap+1.
here, the value of the dilaton coupling parameter b is -1/2 for the ns-ns 2-form
potential and (p 3)/4 for the rr (p + 1)-form potential. the following string-frame
action is obtained through the weyl rescaling transformation ge

we shall compactify some of the longitudinal and the transverse directions of the
intersecting brane congurations to obtain the congurations describing the bps soli-
tons inside of domain walls. since, generally, the spacetime metric of intersecting brane
solutions are diagonal, the kk ansatz for the string-frame metric is

(gs

(37)

where gs
 (,  = 0, 1, ..., d  1) is the string-frame metric in d spacetime dimensions
and gmn (m, n = 1, ..., 10  d) is the internal metric. the d-dimensional dilaton 

12

ln det gmn.

is expressed in terms of the ten-dimensional dilaton  and the internal metric gmn as
follows:

 =  
4
after obtaining the string-frame metric gs
 for a d-dimensional solution by using the
simple compactication ansatz (37), one can apply the weyl-scaling transformation
 = e 4
ge
 for the solution. in addition
to the metric, the dilaton and the form-potential, the compactied d-dimensional
action has additional scalars associated with the internal metric gmn, unlike the case of
dilatonic p-branes inside of dilatonic domain walls considered in the previous section.
as a consequence, the dilaton coupling parameter for p-branes in string theories are
not restricted by the constraint in eq. (27)

 to obtain the einstein-frame metric ge

(38)

supergravity solutions for branes in string theories have the following convenient
properties, which simplify the study of brane solutions in d < 10 signicantly. first,
the einstein-frame solution for the spacetime metric depends only on the spacetime
dimensions d and the dimensionality p of the brane, independently of the type of form
potential under which brane is charged. second, in the case of the rr-charged p-
branes in d < 10, expressions for the spacetime metric and the d-dimensional dilaton
are insensitive to their origin in d = 10. namely, for example, the spacetime metric
and the d-dimensional dilaton for rr 2-brane in d = 6 have the same form whether
they are obtained by compactifying one longitudinal direction and three transverse
directions of d3-brane or they are obtained by compactifying four transverse directions
of d2-brane.

the universal forms of the einstein-frame metrics for a p-brane and a domain wall

in string theories in d < 10 are as follows:

 p-brane:

ds2

e = h

where hp = 1 + qp

(40)

this is the  = 4 case of the spacetime metric for a general dilatonic domain
wall solution in eq. (5).

therefore, the einstein-frame spacetime metrics for the d-dimensional congurations
describing the bps branes inside of the worldvolume of the bps domain walls in string
theories have the following universal forms:

the harmonic functions h and hpp for the domain wall and the pp-wave satisfy

the expressions for d-dimensional dilaton  for various cases are as follows:

 rr p-branes (dimensionally reduced from d-branes): e2 = h (d2p4)/4
 magnetic ns p-branes with p = 0, 1, ..., 5 (dimensionally reduced from ns5-brane

.

p

 domain walls compactied from d-branes: e2 = h d/4.
 domain walls compactied from ns5-brane: e2 = h 1/2.
the form potential for a p-brane has the standard form atx1...xp = 1  h 1

p . the
scalars originated from the internal components of the spacetime metric are dierent
for dierent types of branes and compactications.

whereas the einstein-frame spacetime metrics have the universal forms (as discussed
in the above), the expressions for string-frame spacetime metrics are dierent for dif-
ferent types of form-elds under which the branes are charged. so, in the following
subsections, we present the expressions for the string-frame spacetime metric, as well
as the dilaton, for various cases.

4.1 bps solitons within the rr domain walls

in this subsection, we write down the expressions for the string-frame metrics and the
dilatons of supergravity solutions describing various bps solitons in the worldvolume
of the domain wall charged under the rr form-potential.

first, we consider the congurations where the rr charged p-brane is inside of the
worldvolume of the rr domain walls. supergravity solutions for such congurations
are obtained by compactifying the partially localized supergravity solutions describing
two dp-branes self-intersecting over (p  2)-dimensions, dp-brane ending on d(p + 2)-
brane and dp-brane inside of d(p + 4)-brane. the string-frame metric and the dilaton

(p = 0, 1) inside of the worldvolume of the rr domain wall are obtained by compact-
ifying the partially localized supergravity solution describing the fundamental string
ending on d-branes. the string-frame metric and the dilaton have the following forms:

the dilatons of supergravity solutions describing various bps solitons living in the
worldvolume of the domain wall magnetically charged under the ns-ns form-potential.
