a description of the one-loop approximation formula for the partition
abstract:
function of a three-dimensional abelian version of the donaldson-witten theory is pro-
posed. the one-loop expression is shown to contain such topological invariants of a three-
dimensional manifold m like the reidemeister-ray-singer torsion r and betti numbers.

1. in three dimensions (3d), traditionally, we have the two important well-known topo-
logical quantum eld theories (of cohomological type): non-abelian su(2) topological
gauge theory of at connection and 3d version of the topological seiberg-witten theory.
the former is a 3d twisted n = 4 susy su(2) pure gauge theory or a 3d version of the
donaldson-witten theory, and by denition it describes the casson invariant, which
appropriately (i.e. with sign) counts the number of at su(2) connections [1]. the latter
is a dimensional reduction of the topological seiberg-witten theory or a twisted version
of 3d n = 4 susy u(1) gauge theory with a matter hypermultiplet [2], [3]. also this
theory describes an interesting non-trivial topological invariant of 3d manifolds pertaining
to 3d donaldson-witten invariant which has been conjectured to be equivalent to already
known topological invariants and in particular to topological (reidemeister) torsion [4].
the conjectures are physically strongly motivated by the fact that the both theories can
be derived, performing dimensional reduction and/or taking low-energy limit, from 4d
n = 2 susy su(2) pure gauge theory [5] corresponding via twist to donaldson-witten
theory. interestingly, it follows from [6] that low-energy eective theory for both 3d n = 4
susy su(2) pure gauge case as well as for the n = 4 susy abelian one with matter
hypermultiplet is an abelian pure gauge theory. therefore, we should essentially deal with
3d twisted version of the abelian theorytopological gauge theory of at u(1)-connection
[7]. in dual variables, we have a 3d n = 4 susy -model with a hyper-kahler manifold
as a target space. twisted version of this model has been analyzed in detail by rozansky
and witten in [8]. here, we will consider a corresponding topological model in original
(non-dual) variables. in fact, we will conne ourselves to the lowest-order one-loop calcu-
lation which nevertheless gives a (exact) topological invariantreidemeister-ray-singer
torsionas it should. in spite of a direct interpretation of our model as a low-energy ver-
sion of the above-mentioned gauge models, we can treat it as a stand-alone one as well.
furthermore, we can even treat its (one-loop) gaussian approximation as an independent
model, as we actually do in this note.

2. topological action of our theory assumes the following form

where fmn is the usual u(1)-gauge eld strength, b is a complex scalar,  is a real scalar,
and the elds , , k, k are fermionic elds. the covariant derivative of fermions and
bosons, here denoted as m, is dened using the levi-civita connection on m with a
metric gmn, where m, n, k = 1, 2, 3.
gauge invariance of the action (1) requires gauge xing and introduction of the faddeev-

popov ghost elds c, c

it will appear that the partition function z corresponding to (3) essentially consists of
the reidemeister-ray-singer torsion of 3d manifold m. namely,

(4)

z(m) = z [dx]exp {seucl[x]} ,
where the integration measure [dx] is taken over all the elds

(am, , b, b, , , k, k, c, c).

the path integral over the bosonic eld  gives the factor

(det(0)) 1

(5)
where 0 = mm is a laplacian acting on zero-forms on m and det means that we
exclude zero modes. the integration over the usual ghosts c and c gives det(0), while
the b- and b-integrations give its inverse (det(0))1. so, these modes are canceled.
now let us introduce an operator l which acts on the direct sum of zero- and one-forms
on m [8]

l(, k) = (mm,k +

and similarly for (, k).

following [8] we dene a scalar product

then the part of the action (3) containing , , k and k becomes a quadratic form

the fermionic one-loop contribution [9], with zero modes removed, is

detl.

finally, the integration over the gauge eld am gives

so that the total one-loop contribution of non-zero modes is

the absolute value of the ratio of the determinants in eq.(11) is related to the reidemeister-

ray-singer analytic torsion r(m) [8], [10], [11]. the formula for the absolute value of
the ratio of the determinants is

3. it is not the whole story, because the partition function is, in principle, plagued by
zero modes, which we have removed by hand. there are the following four sorts of zero
modes, which should be treated dierently (the number of some of them may depend on
topology of m): (1) 3 scalar boson zero modes, corresponding to , b and b; (2) b1 (= 1st
betti number of m) vector boson zero modes of am; (3) 1 ghost zero mode for c, c; (4) 2
scalar fermion zero modes of , , and 2b1 one-form zero modes for k, k. the ghost zero
mode can be removed instantaneously because it should not be present in the partition
function from the very beginning at all, as the gauge transformation corresponding to the
constant (zero) mode acts trivially on am. possibly, we could integrate out eq.(4) with
respect to vector zero modes because it corresponds to integrating over b1-torus. the rest
of boson and fermion zero modes produces innities and zeros in the partition function
respectively. in this gaussian approximation/version there is no other possibility than to
remove them by hand. they can be properly handled only in higher orders. we need
a compact-space valued scalar eld (-model) to integrate out scalars, and higher-order
fermion terms to saturate fermion zero modes. as usual, boson and ghost zero modes
yield appropriate powers in the planck constant in front of eq.(4).
