abstract

some time ago, conformal data with ane fusion rules were found. our purpose

here is to realize some of these conformal data, using systems of free bosons and

parafermions. the so constructed theories have an extended w algebras which

are close analogues of ane algebras. exact character formulae is given, and the

realizations are shown to be full edged unitary conformal eld theories.

rational conformal eld theories have been the subject of much research owing

to their pivotal role in string theory and condensed matter physics, initiated in

the work of belavin, polyakov and zamolodchikov [1]. a relation later found by

verlinde [2], connects the fusion rules and the modular matrix. in ref. [3], it was

noticed the the verlinde formula has many, as yet undescribed, solutions and it

was conjectured that these are real rcft (rational conformal eld theories). our

purpose here is to describe explicitly the realizations of these data as full edged

rational conformal eld theories, for some families of subcases.

we concentrate on the ane-like conformal data, as the bosonic case was com-

pletely solved in our recent publication [4]. there we gave a formula for the central

charge of the ane case. these theories are labeled by an integer q, g(k+g)/q where
g is some group, k is the level and q is any integer strange to g(k + g). the theory

g(k+g)/q has the usual ane fusion rules [5], and the central charge,

c =

qkd
k + g

mod 4,

(1)

where g is the dual coxeter number and d is the dimension of the algebra. q = 1

is the usual ane case. inspecting eq. (1), we notice that for q = p(k + g) + 1,

where p is some integer, the central charge obeys,

c(q)  c(1) = integer.

(2)

thus, it is natural to suspect that for these cases g(k+g)/q is the same as the usual
ane case, up to some bosonic system. this is, in fact, our result. more precisely,

recall the parafermionic systems [6]. the ane theories are decomposed into free
bosons and parafermions, whose characters are the so called string functions, c

 ( ),

in such a way that

( ) = x



c
 ( )( ),

(3)

where ( ) is the ane character, and ( ) are the characters of a free bosonic
system, propagating of the lattice km, where m is the root lattice. mathemat-

2

ically, this formula was discussed in [7], and ref.

therein, and given a physical

interpretation in ref. [6].

our strategy, is to knock o the system of bosons in eq. (3) and to replace it

by another system of bosons, so as to get the theory g(k+g)/q. to this avail, we
assume that the new bosonic system has the same fusion rules as the old one. such

bosonic theories were realized fully in ref. [4] and are also labeled by some integer

q, denoted by mk/q, where m is the root lattice. the dimension formula for the
bosonic system is

 =

q2
2k

mod z.

in the pseudo-ane theories (i.e., q 6= 1), the elds have the dimensions

 =

q( + 2)

2(k + g)

mod z,

(4)

(5)

where  is half the sum of positive roots.

combining, now eqs (4-5), we nd the following relation for the dimensions,

(q  1)( + )

2(k + g)

=

(q  1)2

2k

.

(6)

this relation can be fulllled for q  1 = (k + g)p due to the relation     m.
taking q = k p + 1, we nd

p( + 2)

2

=

p2
2

mod z.

(7)

this equation can easilly be satised, i.e., for all p we can nd such p.

examples: 1) take g  su(2). then, we take p = 3p. eq. (7) becomes,

where  = l/2 and  = m/2,

pl(l + 2)

4

=

pm2

4

mod z,

(8)

which is obeyed for p = 3p mod 4.

3

2) take g  su(n) where n is odd. then we take p = p. eq. (7) becomes,

p( + 2)

2

=

p2
2

mod z,

(9)

which is obeyed since   m and    m. the same holds for all algebras with
odd number of center elements.

3) take g = su(n) where n is even. it can be checked that it works exactly

like su(2) with p = (n + 1)p. we omit the detail for brevity sake.

for all the groups it is straightforward to solve the relation eq. (7). further,

since we know all the realizations for such bosonic theories [4], it follows that we

have the complete realizations for all these ane systems as full edged unitary

rcft.

it remains, to verify the modular transformation s :    1

 . this is also

quite simple since for the bosonic systems we have the relation,

s, = exp(2i[( + )  ()  ()]),

(10)

we nd that both sides of eq. (3) have the same modular transformations. on the

l.h.s. we have

s, = i|||

m 

(k + g)m | 1

2 x

(1)we2iqw(+)(+)/(k+g),

(11)

ww

where w is the weyl group and || is the number of positive roots. for q =
p(k + g) + 1 we get the phase e2i(+)(+)/2 times the q = 1 s matrix, which

is exactly what is needed, by eq. (10).

now, albeit ref.

[4] presents all the realizations for the bosonic theories, the

solution has to be worked out case by case. further, we would like to nd the

realizations with minimal central charge. using the methods of ref.

[4] it is not

too dicult to present such a construction. this we do here for su(2).

first we introduce two types of matrices [4], which depend on three integer
parameters, x, y, z, obeying x > 0, y > 0 and z2 < 4xy. these matrices represent

the scalar products between the basic vectors of the even lattices. the matrices

are, of e type,

there are several cases. introduce the usual theta function for the lattice m,

 ( ) = x
m

m +

,

(16)

where m is some lattice and   m  mod m. first, we take for m the usual
parafermionic lattice m  (2k). however, we permute the elds,

l = x

m=l mod 2

cl
mzm.

(17)

we claim that for some z this realizes the pseudo-ane theory, for k = 0 mod 8.

from the formula for the dimensions, we need

z2  1 = pk,

which is solved as follows:

1) k = 0 mod 8, p = 1 mod 4: p = k/4  1, z = 1 + k/2.
2) k = 0 mod 4, p = 2 mod 4: z = k  1, p = k  2.
3) k = 0 mod 4, p = 1 mod 4: m  e1,k/4+1,1

with z = 1. for p = 3 mod 4 it is the same lattice with z = k  1 (for k = 0 mod 8),
z = k/2 + 1 (for k = 4 mod 16), z = k/2  1 (for k = 12 mod 16).

4) for k = 2 mod 4, p = 1, 2, 3 . . .. we have: m  ak,(k+2)/4,k

character is given by eq. (19) with z = 1.

and the

5) k = 1 mod 4, with p = 2 mod 4 we have: m  ek,(k+3)/4,k

with the character

6) k = 1 mod 4, p = 2 mod 4: m  a1,(k+5)/4,2

eq. (19) with z = (k  1)/2.

. the characters are given by

this concludes all the allowed cases.

let us discuss now the extended algebra. in some cases we have, in fact, a

realization in terms of ane algebra. for example, at k = 2 all the bosonic lattices

are given for all q by dn, for some n. the full theory is then so(2n + 1)1. the

decomposition eq. (3) is the usual decomposition for so(2n + 1) into n bosons

and a fermion.

now, in all the cases, we have an extended current

x(z) = 1(z):ei,

(20)

where 1(z) is the rst parafermion of dimensions  = 11/k. thus the dimension
of this current is

x = 1  1/k + 2/2,

(21)

which is always an integer. it is straight forwards to compute x from the list

above, and we nd, typically, that x = p + 1, where p = 0, 1, 2, 3 . . .. in the ope
of x with x  (x with x is nonsingular) we nd only t (the stress tensor) and j
(u(1) current). thus we denote by ap the algebra generated by x, x , t and j
(along with the derivatives and products, of course, of t and j). a0 is the usual
su(2) ane algebra. a1/2 (by continuation: the algebras and the models can be
dened for p half intgral, although the fusion rules no longer coincides with su(2)

ane ones; the algebra is then ap with half integral p) is the n = 2 superconformal

algebra. the rest of the algebras appear to be new.

the blocks of these theories, with respect to the algebra ap are in 11 relation

with ordinary su(2) obeying also the same fusion rules. the modular matrix is a

permutation of the su(2) one.

the exact ope of x with x  is easily determined. for example, for p = 1 we

nd

x (z)x(u) =

1

(z  u)4 +

j(u)

(z  u)3 +

atp(u) + j + jj

(z  u)2

+

(22)

7

2atp + ajtp + 1
(z  u)

6jjj + 1

2jj

+ regular,

where j(u) = i is the u(1) current, a = 2(1)/cp.f., tp = t  1
2 jj is the
stress tensor minus the u(1) part. the rest of the opes (x and x  with j and

t ) are obvious and we omit them for brevity, as x is a primary eld with the
u(1) charge 2. the commutation relations for the moments of the algebra can

be easily written by standard methods [1]. it is important that the algebra a2 (as
the others) is expressed solely in terms of x, x , t and j, as this guarantees its

universality. the parameters above depend only on p and the central charge. the

algebra ap has two quantum numbers  (the dimension of the eld), and q (the

u(1) charge).

let us digress now to describe the minimal models of the algebra ap. these

are labeled, for each p, by an integer k. the central charge is

c =

3k

k + 2

,

(23)

i.e., the same as su(2) (p = 0 case). we add one free bosons to the parafermions,

x = 0

2:ei:,

(24)

where  = p2(kp + 1)/k. now, acting k times with x, the parafermion drops
and we get a net shift in momenta of k = p2(kp + 1)k. this means that the
characters are expressed in terms of a theta function at the level k(kp+1). further,

acting with a single x gives a shift of 2 in the parafermion and a shift of  in the

bosonic momenta. thus, the characters are given by

m,m = x
l

r mod k

cl
m+2rm+2(kp+1)r;k(kp+1).

(25)

this equation holds for p integer or half integer. now, the primary elds are
obtained by the demand that xn and x 

n vanish for negative n. for integer p, we

8

nd

|m  m|

k

 p,

(26)

and is integral. for p half inetgral in the ns sector it is the same, and in the r

sector, it is half integral. we believe that these are the minimal models for the

algebras ap with p = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, . . ..

for algebras, other than su(2), we similarly get extended algebras for the

realizations. the calculation of the opes is more dicult, but straightforwrd.

we can actually use the duality relation,

su(n)m  su(m)n  u(1)  u(nm)1,

(27)

to express the theories su(n)q with q = 1 + (k + g)q, in terms of su(m)n
parafermions and bosons. this proceeds by rst writing

su(n)m/q = su(m)n/q  free bosons,

(28)

and then proceeding as before. it can be seen that the equation for the dimension

of the eld, eq. (6), work as before. we omit the detail.

finally, the reader must be curious about the general pseuso-ane theory. how

is it realized? we believe the answer lie in multi-parafermion theories. it was noted

already by zamolodchikov and fateev [6] that the monodromy of parafermions

allows for a more general solution,

(n) = qn(k  n)/k + mn,

(29)

(for su(2); for other algebras it is similar), where n is the nth zk parafermion,
and mn are some integers. the multi-parafermions are for the large part, yet to

be explored. however, we believe that the central charge is

c(q) = qc(1) mod 4,

(30)

and thus by gluing them with free bosons it is possible to get the central charge of

the pseudo ane systems. we hope to report on this in the future.
