abstract

we nd an exact, n = 1 supersymmetric kink solution of 5d gauged supergravity.
we associate this solution with the rg ow from n = 4 super yang-mills theory,

deformed by a relevant operator, to pure n = 1 super yang-mills in the ir. we
test this identication by computing various qft quantities using the supergravity
dual: the tension of electric and magnetic strings and the gaugino condensate. as

demanded by our identication, our kink solution is a true deformation of n = 4,
that exhibits connement of quarks, magnetic screening, and spontaneous chiral

symmetry breaking.

1 introduction

in previous papers [1, 2] we explored several properties of relevant deformations of strongly-

coupled n = 4 super yang-mills using its dual [3, 4, 5] description in terms of 5d gauged
supergravity. in this paper we present a holographic rg ow from n = 4 sym to pure n = 1

sym in the ir. we nd agreement with eld theory expectations, namely, quarks conne,
monopoles are screened, and there is a gaugino condensate.

this paper is the natural continuation of [1, 2], where we studied the supergravity description
of rg ows. in particular, in [1] we proved the existence of a kink solution of 5d supergravity

that was interpreted as the dual of a mass-deformed n = 4 super yang-mills, owing in the ir
to a non-supersymmetric, interacting, local conformal eld theory (cft) (see also [6]). we also
introduced a c-function and we proved a c-theorem valid for all supergravity ows involving

the metric and an arbitrary number of scalars. such a setup, namely coupled gravity-scalar
equations is remarkably versatile, and it can also describe deformations of n = 4 owing to

non-conformal, interacting theories.

most of the solutions asymptotic to the n = 4 uv xed point go to innity in the space of

parameters described by the 5d supergravity. it is natural to interpret these solutions as rg
ows to non-conformal ir theories. examples were considered in [2, 7]. the generic solutions
discussed in [2] exhibit dierent behaviours in the ir, from connement to screening, associated

with an ir singularity that is common to many 10d solutions [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. in [7] the
coulomb branch of n = 4 ym was studied.

in view of the double role of supergravity solutions with an asymptotic ads region (de-
formations of an uv xed point versus the same theory in a dierent vacuum [14, 15]), we

may ask whether the solutions in [2] are true deformations of n = 4 ym or simply dierent
states (e.g. spontaneously broken vacua) of the same theory. the case of [8, 9] turned out to

correspond to a dierent vacuum of n = 4 ym; the same is certainly true also for [7]. unlike
the solutions in [7, 8, 9], the ones in [2] are expected to describe deformations. however, up to
now, no explicit, analytically solvable example of deformations was given in literature. one of

the purposes of this paper is to provide such an example, describing the pure n = 1 ym case.
another important question is the reliability of supergravity solutions. problems were

pointed out in [7], after an explicit comparison of supergravity predictions to gauge theory
results. in the screening case discussed in [7], the type iib string goes near the singularity, and

any actual computation requires the form of the solution in the ir, where large corrections to
the supergravity result are expected. it is then important, to better understand the seriousness

of this problem, to consider other solutions where comparison with quantum eld theory expec-
tation can be made. the simplest such case, which corresponds to a deformation of the n = 4
theory, is the ow to pure n = 1 ym. in this paper, we exhibit a solution with all qualitative

1

features of pure n = 1 super ym theory, in particular, quark connement. even in our case the

conning string probes a high-curvature singularity; it is therefore encouraging to nd that at
least in some cases this problem does not change the qualitative picture (connement, magnetic

screening, chiral symmetry braking) emerging from eld theory. to better control our solutions
we are led to consider supersymmetric examples. the equally interesting n = 0 solutions are

certainly less reliable, even though they are easier to study [2].

this paper is organised as follows: in section 2, we give a brief review of the basic results
in the interpretation of 5d supergravity solutions as rg ows, following [1, 2]. we also discuss

the cases of ows to ir conformal and non-conformal theories, with particular attention to
open problems. section 3 describes in details the ow to n = 1 ym and its properties. the

computation of electric and magnetic strings, and the identication of the supergravity eld
describing the gaugino condensate are described. that section also contains a brief discussion

of the stability of chirally-symmetric versus chiral-symmetry breaking vacua. the appendix
contains various useful formulae used throughout the paper.

2 rg flow from 5d supergravity: a brief review

to x once for all our notations, we will use coordinates where the anti-de-sitter space reads

ds2 = dy2 + e2y/rdxdx,  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

(1)

r is the ads radius and it will be henceforth set to 1, unless explicitly stated.

the fth coordinate y of ads5 has a natural interpretation as an energy scale [3, 16, 17, 18].
as in [1], we associate larger energies with increasing y. we look for the supergravity description
of the quantum eld theory rg ow that connects, say, the n = 4 ym theory to some ir cft.

it was proposed in [1] to identify this rg ow with solutions of type iib supergravity that
interpolate between ads5  s5 at y =  and the type iib background associated with the ir
cft at y = . we are interested in studying relevant deformations of the n = 4 theory. the
explicit dependence on y must therefore break the conformal group o(4, 2) to the 4d poincare
group. y =  will be considered the uv, while y =  the extreme ir.

in the previous and following discussions, the n = 4 theory can be replaced by any other

cft that admits an ads description.

supergravity solutions have a double meaning: they may describe deformations of a cft,
or, the same theory in a dierent vacuum [14, 15]. indeed, the running of coupling constants

and parameters along the rg ow can be induced in the uv theory in two dierent ways: by
deforming the cft with a relevant operator, or by giving a nonzero vev to some operator.

what the case is for a given solution depends on the asymptotic uv behaviour. the cft

2

operators that are used as deformations, or that are acquiring a non-zero vev, can be found by
linearising the solution near y = . the type iib supergravity scalar modes (y) that deform
the ads5  s5 solution at y =  are associated with cft operators o [4, 5]. the linearised
5d equation of motion for a uctuation (y) in the ads-background eq. (1) reads

 + 4  = m 2,

(2)

where the dot means the derivative with respect to y. the mass of the supergravity mode is

related to the conformal dimension  of the operator o by  = 2 + 4 + m 2 [4, 5].

equation (2) has a solution depending on two arbitrary parameters

(y) = ae(4)y + bey.

(3)

we are interested in the case of relevant operators, where   4. a solution with a 6= 0 is (uv)
asymptotic to the non-normalizable solution e(4)y [5], and is associated with a deformation
of the n = 4 theory with the operator o. on the other hand, a solution asymptotic to the
normalizable2 solution ey (a = 0) is associated with a dierent vacuum of the uv theory,
where the operator o has a non-zero vev [14, 15].

2.1 the 5d supergravity: flow between cfts and the c-theorem

10d solutions interpolating between cfts are dicult to nd because of the high non-linearity

of the type iib equations of motion. perturbation theory around the uv point is not practicable
and exact solutions are not easy to construct. if we restrict the number of operators that we

may use to deform the uv xed point, we can consider the 5d gauged supergravity instead of
the full 10d theory [1, 6].

the n = 8 gauged supergravity [19] is a consistent truncation of type iib on s5 [20]. this
means that every solution of the 5d theory can be lifted to a consistent 10d type iib solution.
the operators that can be described using 5d supergravity are enough to mimic many rg ows.

in particular, all mass terms of fermions and scalars, which can be described by supergravity
modes, are included in the 5d truncated theory. the only relevant operators that cannot be

described by this method are cubic terms in the scalars. five-dimensional gauged supergravity
has 42 scalars, which transform under the n = 4 ym r-symmetry su(4) as 1, 20, 10. the
singlet is associated with the marginal deformation corresponding to a change in the coupling
constant of the n = 4 theory. the 20 is a mode with mass square m 2 = 4 and is associated
with the symmetric traceless operator tr ij, i, j = 1, ..., 6 of dimension 2. the 10 has mass
square m 2 = 3 and is associated with the fermion bi-linear operator tr ab, a, b = 1, ..., 4,

2here we are only considering the uv behaviour.

of dimension 3. using these operators, we can discuss at least all mass deformations that have
a supergravity description3.

the eective 5d lagrangian, restricted to the 42 scalars a, is

(4)

in all our applications, we will choose a convenient parametrisation where the scalar kinetic term
is canonical (gab = ab). this is the most general lagrangian for scalars coupled to gravity.
the contribution of the 5d gauged supergravity [19] is to provide the potential v ().

v () has a central critical point where all the a vanish with so(6) symmetry and ads
metric: it corresponds to the n = 4 ym theory. it is natural to associate all other ads critical
points of the potential with ir cfts that can be connected to the n = 4 theory by an rg
ow. the scalars with a non-zero vev, ir, at the critical points indicate which operators have
been used to deform the uv theory. up to now, all critical points with at least su(2) symmetry
have been classied [21, 22]. there exist three n = 0 theories with symmetry su(3)  u(1),
so(5) and su(2) u(1)2. all those ir cft theories are obtained as mass deformations of the
n = 4 theory [1, 6]. both the rst two critical points might be unstable [6, 23]; the third one
has not been yet investigated. moreover, there is an n = 1 point with symmetry su(2) u(1)
[22], which is stable due to supersymmetry; it is associated with the n = 4 theory deformed

with a supersymmetric mass for one of the three n = 1 chiral superelds [24]. the value of
the potential at the critical point (determining the cosmological constant of the ads space) is

associated with the central charges c = a of the cft by [25]

c = a  (v (ir))3/2.

(5)

in the case of the supersymmetric point su(2)  u(1) the central charge predicted by super-
gravity agrees with quantum eld theory expectation [24]4.

the supergravity description of the rg ow connecting the n = 4 theory to one of these
ir cfts was found in [1] in the form of a kink solution, which interpolates between the two

critical points. the form of a 4d poincare invariant metric is

ds2 = dy2 + e2(y)dxdx,  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

(6)

we look for solutions that are asymptotic to ads5 spaces (but with dierent radii ru v and rir)
both for y   and y  : (y)  y/ru v + const for y  , and (y)  y/rir + const
for y  . analogously, (y)  0 for y  , while (y)  ir for y  . the equations

(8)

with the above boundary conditions and a reasonable shape for the potential, a kink interpolat-
ing between critical points always exists [1]. the argument is roughly as follows: by eliminating

 from one of the equations, the problem reduces to the classical motion of a particle in a
potential with never-vanishing, positive damping. since the particle is rolling down from the

top of a hill (the ir cft), the damping implies that it will stop at the bottom of the hill (the
n = 4 point)5.

the interpretation of the kink as a rg ow can be strengthened by exhibiting a candidate

c-function [1],

c(y) = const (tyy)3/2.

(9)

constructed with the y component of the stress-energy tensor, tyy = 6( )2 = pa( a)2  2v .

this expression certainly reduces to the central charge eq. (5) at the critical points, where
a = 0. moreover, it is a straightforward exercise to prove that c(y) is monotonic, using the
equations of motion and the already-mentioned boundary conditions6. even more simply, c(y)
is inversely proportional to the energy of our classical particle in a potential, and, with a positive
damping, energy always decreases. this proof of the c-theorem is valid for all the supergravity

ows involving the metric and an arbitrary number of scalars; it generalises to generic poincare
invariant supergravity solutions in [27].

in ref. [27] the conditions for a supersymmetric ow were found. as usual, a solution for
which the fermionic shifts vanish, automatically satises the equations of motion. moreover,

this shortcut reduces the second order equations to rst order ones. for a supersymmetric
solution, the potential v can be written in terms of a superpotential, w , as

5note that, in this particle interpretation, we are going from ir to uv.

6from the equations of motion we have 6  = 4pa( a)2 and it is easy to check that, due to the boundary

 is always positive. to avoid confusion, note that y measures the energy in a direction opposite
conditions,
to the one of the rg group: y increases when the energy increases. c(y) is however monotonic exactly in the
expected way: it decreases going from uv to ir.

5

it is easy to check that a solution of eq.(12) satises also the second order equations (8). using
this result, in [27] the n = 1 xed point su(2)  u(1) was studied in detail, nding agreement
with quantum eld theory expectations.

all these kink solutions generically correspond to deformations of the uv xed point; this

can be explicitly checked for the su(2)  u(1) point.

2.2 flow to non-conformal theories

what remains yet to discuss is the most interesting part of the story, but also the subtlest: the
case of non-conformal ir theories. most solutions that start at the n = 4 xed point do not

ow to a dierent critical point, instead, they run away to innity in conguration space. it
is natural to interpret these solutions as rg ows to non-conformal theories [2]. it is indeed
expected that most of the mass deformations of n = 4 xed point ow to pure-glue theories

in the ir. in [2], we examined a general class of solutions and we provided the general tools
for studying the ir behaviour of those theories. solutions were studied for which the scalar

potential becomes irrelevant in the ir. despite this restriction, those solutions can be called
generic, since they ll a large subset of the parameter space. in those solutions the ir 5d

einstein metric has a universal singular form

ds2 = dy2 + y  adxdx,  = 0, 1, 2, 3,
with a logarithmic behaviour a = aa log(y  a) for the scalar elds.

supersymmetric solutions are not generic, since they satisfy eq. (12), which prevents the

(13)

potential from being irrelevant in the ir. however, modications of the results of [2] due to
supersymmetry are minimal, mostly a slight change in the form of the ir metric, which remains

singular; scalar elds maintain a logarithmic behaviour. supersymmetric solutions associated
with the coulomb branch of the n = 4 theory were studied in [7].

in the solutions found in [2], there is a singularity in the ir, whose generic form is common

to many ten dimensional solutions from type iib [8, 9, 10] to type ob [28] and even to non-
critical strings [11, 12]. agreement with the solutions in [8, 9, 10] is expected, since they can

be described in the language of n = 8 5d gauge supergravity. agreement with type o and
non-critical strings is unexpected, but it becomes a little less surprising when one realizes that

those solutions can be reduced to eective 5d theories of scalars coupled to gravity.

depending on the value of the parameters aa, the solutions may exhibit conformal behaviour,
connement, or screening in the ir. the appropriate case can be determined by computing a

wilson loop. following [29], the wilson loop associated with a contour c on the boundary is
obtained minimising the world-sheet action of a string living in the background (6) and whose

endpoints live on the boundary contour c. by considering a rectangular loop c, with one side

6

of length l in the direction x and another one of length t along the time axis, and by choosing

the standard embedding  = x,  = t we nd:

s = z d dqgind = t z dxt (y)e(y)q(xy)2 + e2(y).

(14)

here t (y) is the tension of the fundamental (the case of a quark) or of the d1 string
(monopole) in ve dimensions, which in general is a non-trivial function of the scalar elds. as

discussed in [2] on the basis of naive dimensional reduction from ten dimensions, the tensions can
be read from the coecients of the kinetic term for the ns-ns and r-r antisymmetric tensors,

respectively. since in the ve-dimensional supergravity lagrangian [21] the kinetic term for the
antisymmetric tensors is written in the rst order formalism

bi  dbi + ai,jbi  bj,

(15)

the tensions come from the matrix ai,j in the quadratic term. in particular they receive
contribution only from the diagonal entries of a, the o-diagonal ones contributing to the mass
terms for the b tensors.

the wilson loop is conveniently studied in the coordinates where the quark-antiquark (or

monopole-antimonopole) energy reads,

the change of variable being given by

e = s/t = z dxq(xu)2 + f (u),

u
y

= t (y)e(y), f (u) = t 2(u)e4(u).

(16)

(17)

the boundary is now at u = +, while the ir region corresponds to small values of u.

the wilson loop behaviour is determined by that of the function f (u) [2, 30].

[2] reviews

in detail all the dierent cases that can occur, here we give only a sketch of the results.
if
f (u)  u for small u, with   2 the quark-antiquark energy has a power-like behaviour,
with exponent depending on . the conformal case is  = 4. if 0    2, then the string
will nd energetically favourable to go straight to the ir region, where to separate the quarks
does not cost any energy [30]. when   0, there is an eective barrier that prevents the
string from penetrating into the deep ir region; it will live near the minimum of the function
f (u). we therefore expect an area law behaviour, i.e. connement. a similar result holds when

the function f (u) does not diverge, but is strictly bounded above zero. the case of a barrier
(connement) is the one where the supergravity computation is more reliable. it is plausible

that the minimum of f (u) lives in a region far from the singularity, where supergravity can be
still trusted. on the other hand, the case of screening is the least reliable. the string has to

7

touch the singularity before the quarks can be separated without spending energy; but large

corrections to the supergravity result certainly are expected in the deep ir region.

having settled all the machinery for studying solutions where scalars run to innity, we may

start to discuss their physical meaning. the rst important problem is to understand whether
a solution corresponds to a deformation or to a dierent vacuum of the n = 4 theory. after

initial confusion, the solution in [8, 9] was identied as a dierent phase of the n = 4 theory;
the same is certainly true for the solutions in [7], describing the coulomb branch of n = 4 ym.
we should not conclude from this that all the solutions in [2] correspond to vacua of the n = 4

theory.

the solutions in [7, 8, 9, 10, 31] are associated with operators that may reasonably have a non-
zero vev in the n = 4 theory 7. it is reasonable to associate solutions were the dilaton (and/or
axion) runs [8, 9, 31] with vacua with non-zero htr f 2i, and solutions where the scalars in the
20 run [7] with the coulomb branch of n = 4 ym, where htr (ij)i 6= 0. it is instead dicult
to image solutions where the 10 runs as vacua of the n = 4 theory with non-zero fermionic

condensate.
it is quite plausible that many of the solutions with non-zero 10 correspond to
deformations of the uv xed point rather than dierent vacua. since, in general, we do not
know the full solution connecting the uv with the singular ir region, we can not explicitly

check this claim. here, we simply note that the description of a dierent vacuum requires a
uv-normalizable solution, with asymptotic behaviour as in eq. (3). this would require a ne

tuning (a = 0); obviously, this cannot be the generic situation. note also that the case of a
running dilaton considered in [8, 9], which turned out to correspond to a vacuum of the theory,

is quite special. for operators of dimension 4, equation (3) becomes,

(y) = a + be4y

(18)

the non-normalizable solution, the one associated with a true deformation of the uv theory,
here becomes a constant. in the case of the dilaton, a non-normalizable solution can be always

re-absorbed into a shift of the n = 4 coupling constant. this means that every solution where
only the dilaton (and/or axion) runs is uv-asymptotic to the normalizable solution; therefore,
it corresponds to a dierent vacuum of the n = 4 theory. completely dierent is the case

of dimension-three operators, where both behaviours in eq. (3) are allowed. in this paper we
provide an explicit example of solution associated with a deformation of the n = 4 theory.

the uv behaviour in the supersymmetric case can always be determined using equations
(12). in this paper we will consider a supersymmetric case, the rg ow from n = 4 to pure

n = 1 ym, which corresponds to the running of elds in the 10; it can be explicitly recognised as

7we can understand which operator gets a vev or appears as a deformation by looking at the supergravity

elds that run in y.

8

a deformation of the uv theory. we will prove that quarks conne and monopoles are screened

by computing a wilson loop. once we are in the the n = 1 theory, the existence of a fermionic
condensate is no more to be regarded as suspect; it is instead expected, since pure n = 1 ym

has a gluino condensate. we will check the existence of the condensate by playing with the
double role of supergravity solutions, deformations versus vev. we will nd a supersymmetric

solution of the equations of motion depending on two scalars m and , the rst being associated
with the mass term which breaks n = 4 to n = 1 pure ym, the second being associated with
the gluino condensate operator 8. by checking the asymptotic uv behaviour, m turns out to be
associated with a deformation of the n = 4 theory, while  with a vev. this means that our
solution describes an rg ow to the n = 1 pure ym in a vacuum with non-zero condensate.

we must spend a few words on the reliability of these singular solutions. since the curvature
and the kinetic terms for the scalars typically diverge in the ir region, large corrections to

supergravity may be expected. an explicit comparison between supergravity and quantum eld
theory has been made in [7] for the case of the n = 4 coulomb branch and several discrepancies

were pointed out. by itself, this result does not immediately implies that all the other solutions
describing connement should be considered as suspect. in a certain sense, screening is more
sensitive to infrared physics than connement: any amount of string tension, no matter how

small, will destroy it.

our contribution to the debate about reliability of supergravity solutions is to present a

pure n = 1 ym example, where all qualitative features expected in the quantum eld theory,
namely connement and a gaugino condensate, can be explicitly found in the supergravity side.

we must also point out that the singularity of the metric eq. (13) might be an artifact of the 5d
einstein-frame metric. such a singularity may appear also when the higher-dimensional metric
is regular. for instance, write r9 with at metric in polar coordinates as r+ s3  r5, perform
a dimensional reduction to r+  r5, and rescale to the 5d einstein frame: the resulting metric
has the same singularity (at r = 0) as in eq. (13). naturally, when the singularity is an artifact

of the dimensional reduction, the supergravity computation of the string tension is completely
justied. this is the case, for instance, of the non-conformal backgrounds in ref. [32]

3 the n = 1 theory

in this section we will discuss the properties of the ve-dimensional supergravity solution cor-

responding to a deformation of n = 4 super yang-mills theory with a supersymmetric mass
term for the three fermions in the chiral n = 1 multiplets. in n = 1 notation, this is a mass

the theory ows in the ir to pure n = 1 yang-mills, which connes.
to obtain the standard n = 1 pure yang-mills with xed scale , we need a ne tuning of

the uv parameters, in which the mass m diverges while the t hooft coupling constant, x, goes
to zero as an (inverse) logarithm of m. this is outside the regime of validity of supergravity,

which requires a large x, but we may still expect to nd from supergravity the qualitative
properties of the theory.

3.1 mass deformation

the supersymmetric mass term for the chiral multiplets, mij, transforms as the 6 of su(3), and
the corresponding supergravity mode appears in the decomposition of the 10  1 + 6 + 3 of
su(4) under su(3)  u(1). in principle, a generic non-zero vev for mij will induce non-zero
vevs for other scalars as well, due to the existence of linear couplings of m to other elds in
the potential. however, if we further impose so(3) symmetry, by taking an mij proportional
to the identity matrix, a simple group theory exercise shows that all remaining elds can be
consistently set to zero9.

exactly 42 real independent parameters, which are the scalars of the supergravity theory.

we shall not discuss here the philosophy and details of the computation of the potential and
kinetic terms, since the have been extensively described in several previous papers [6, 21, 22]. in
the appendix, the interested reader can nd a summary of the relevant formulae and the explicit

parametrisation for the coset manifold representative we used. the result for the diagonal scalar

mass terms, is associated with a stringy state and does not force us to introduce a second scalar eld in the
supergravity ow.

n = 8 vacuum, where all scalars have zero vev, is normalised as v (n = 8) = 3.

where r is the curvature of ads5.

we want to nd a solution of 5d gauged supergravity with one asymptotically-ads5 region,
corresponding to the uv n = 4 super yang-mills theory. the ansatz for the 4-d poincare

invariant metric is [2]

ds2 = dy2 + e2(y)dxdx,  = 0, 1, 2, 3,

(22)

with   y/r + const when y  . we also assume that our scalar only depends on the radial
coordinate. the boundary conditions for the scalars is that they approach the so(6), n = 8
invariant stationary point: for y  , m must vanish.

the solution we are looking for should correspond to an n = 1 supersymmetric ow on

the dual eld theory side. as discussed in [21, 22], it is possible to determine the number of
supersymmetries of a certain supergravity conguration by inspection of the eigenvalues of the
tensor wab in the scalar potential (see the appendix for the denition of the tensors below)

v = 

1

8 h2wabw ab  wabcdw abcdi .

(23)

the number of supersymmetries is given by the number of eigenvalues for which eq.(10) is
valid [27].

in our case, where only the scalar m is considered, wab has two dierent eigenvalues

w1 = 

w2 =

eq. (10). this corresponds to an n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory.

it is easy to check that only the second one satises

supersymmetry also makes it possible to reduce the problem of solving the second order
equations of motion to solving equations for the fermion shifts, i.e. rst order equations, with
w =  3

(31)

notice that, although singular, this is not the universal behaviour found in [2]:

indeed,
because of supersymmetry, it is not possible to ignore the potential in the equations of motion.

on the other hand, it is easy to see that this solution corresponds to a true deformation of the
gauge theory. indeed, m approaches the boundary in the uv (y  ) as m  ey, which is
the required behaviour of a deformation (see eq.(3)).

as we said before, we expect the gauge theory to exhibit connement in the ir. in order
to prove connement for our solution, we need to check that the wilson loop has an area law

behaviour. as discussed in the previous section, to compute the wilson loop we need to minimise
the action for a string whose endpoints are constrained on a contour c on the boundary. for
the background (22) and with the choice of variables of eq.(17)11, this reads

e = s/t = z dxq(xu)2 + f (u).

(32)

as already explained in the previous section (see also [2] for a more detailed discussion),

connement depends on the behaviour for small u of the function

f (u) = t 2(u)e4(u).

(33)

in our example the tension of the fundamental strings and of the d1-strings, t (u), are, respec-
tively,12

so that the asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding functions f (u) is

f(q q)(u)  1,

f(m m)(u)  |u  c1| .

(34)

(35)

(36)

according to the discussion in the previous section, this is indeed what we need to have quark
connement (i.e. a linear potential) and monopole screening.

11we consider a rectangular loop c as in eq. (14) and we also factorize the trivial dependence in t.
12the explicit form of the matrix a from which the tension can be read is given in the appendix.

3.2 gaugino condensate

another feature of n = 1 super yang mills is the presence of a gaugino condensate.

it is

then natural to ask whether this feature can be found in the supergravity solution. the key
point is again the double meaning of the solutions in ads: true deformations of the gauge theory
correspond to non-normalizable solutions of the supergravity equation of motion, while dierent

vacua correspond to normalizable solutions.

in the decomposition 10  1 + 6 + 3 of su(4) under su(3)  u(1), a scalar su(3)-singlet

appears: . it corresponds to a bilinear operator in the gaugino elds 13.

it is tempting to interpret a non-zero vev for this scalar as the gaugino condensate. to

substantiate this interpretation, we must look for solutions where both the elds m and  are
given a non-zero vev and check whether they have the right uv asymptotic behaviour: m has
to be asymptotic to the non-normalizable solution e(4)y of eq.(3), and  to the normalizable
one ey. it is easy to see that this is indeed the case.

the ve-dimensional lagrangian for the elds m and  now becomes

(37)

the tensor wab in the potential has one eigenvalue, w2 = 3
generacy 2, satisfying eq.(10). thus, we are still dealing with solutions describing n = 1
supersymmetric rg ows

log[2 sinh(3y  c2)],

(38)

(39)

(40)

the uv is at y = +, and it is immediate to see that m and  have the desired asymptotic

behaviour for y  :

m  ey,   e3y.

(41)

the solution we have found corresponds, therefore, to a supersymmetric mass deformation of
n = 4 sym that gives rise to a rg ow to a n = 1 sym vacuum with a gaugino condensate14.

13a non-zero vev for this eld alone was studied in [1, 6]. it leads to a non-supersymmetric, conformal ir

xed point.

14note that the ir contributions to operator condensates found in [2] vanish in this case.

13

finally one may ask whether the presence of the condensate aects the ir behaviour of the

solution, in particular connement. the form of the tensions for the f1 and d1-string in the
presence of both m and  is

t 2

t 2

f 1 = 4"cosh

d1 = 8"cosh  m

.

+ 2!# ,

(42)

(43)

it is easy to see from these formulae that the asymptotic behaviours of the functions f(q,q)(u)
and f(m, m)(u) in eq.(36) remain unchanged: the solution is still conning.

notice that the only assumption we make is that the integrations constants c1,2 satisfy the

inequality c2  3c1.

it is interesting to notice that our solution depends on two constants of integration. this may

signal that our supergravity background describes a two-parameter deformation of pure n = 1
super yang-mills. after all, the construction in ref. [34] shows that such deformation exists, and

is given by a suitable compactication to four dimensions of a 6d (2, 0) superconformal theory.
notice also that eqs. (38,39,40) describe chiral-symmetry preserving ( = 0) as well as chiral-
symmetry breaking ows ( 6= 0). the chirality-preserving ow is unstable in the sense that
any nonzero  in the uv (i.e. at large positive y), no matter how small, ows in the ir (y = c1)
to a nite, nonzero  =  log[tanh(3c1/2  c2/2)]. this behaviour agrees with eld theory
expectations [33, 34].

moreover, let us point out that a nonzero condensate  implies the existence of domain walls,

interpolating between vacua with dierent values of . since the tension of these domain walls
scales as n, instead of n2, in the large-n limit [33], they do not appear as classical supergravity
solitons, but rather as d-branes [34]. this is consistent with the vanishing of the potential
barrier between chiral-symmetry breaking vacua, evident from our explicit solution. to nd

which quantum soliton or d-brane plays the role of domain wall in our solution is an interesting
problem that we shall leave open (for the time being, at least).

finally, we would like to remark that the parametrisation used in eq.(40) 15 allows also to
describe the n = 0 su(3) critical point. denoting by rir the radius of the anti-de-sitter
space corresponding to the ir xed point, the square mass of the uctuation of the eld m
around the su(3) point is (40/9)r2
ir, which violates the unitarity bound [35]. this supports
the suggestion that the su(3) critical point is unstable [23]. our parametrisation diers from

that obtained in [6], which we used in [2]. thus the scalar potential in section 3 of [2] has to
be substituted with eq.(21). this change does not aect the general results discussed in that

paper.

15see eq.(a.12) for the explicit form of the coset manifold representative.

appendix: conventions and useful formulae for the la-
grangian

in this appendix we discuss some of the details of the computations that led to the results in
the paper. we will present our results for the case where both the elds m and  are turned on.
the case where only m is considered can be easily recovered by setting  equal to zero. this

appendix is not meant to be self-contained, since the tools for computing the potential have
been already described in details in [21] and recently reviewed in [6, 22]. the reader may refer

to the above-mentioned papers for more details.

parametrisation of the coset manifold

the ve-dimensional lagrangian for the scalars is written in terms of the 27  27 matrix u,
parametrising the coset e6/usp(8), as

l = g(cid:20) r
4 

1
24

tr (u1u)2 + v (u)(cid:21) .

(a.1)

to evaluate it, one has rst to choose a parametrisation for the coset manifold representative,

u = exp x, that gives canonical kinetic terms for the scalars. the precise form of the matrix x
is obtained using the global and local symmetries of the problem, and the fact that u maps an
element of the representation 27 of e6 into itself. the general parametrisation for u has been
worked out in [21]. in the gauged theory, only the group su(4)  sl(2; r) is a symmetry of
the lagrangian. the 42 scalars then decompose according to

42  20(0) + 10(2) + 10(2) + 1(4) + 1(4),

while the vectors in the 27 decompose as

27  15(0) + 6(2) + 6(2).

(a.2)

(a.3)

the subscripts denote the charges of the u(1) factor in sl(2; r). the 27 of e6 is represented
by a couple of antisymmetric symplectic-traceless indices a, b, running form 1 to 8, and, in the

15

su(4)  sl(2; r) basis, it decomposes as

27  15 + (6, 2),
zi ! ,
zab    zij

(a.4)

(a.5)

with i, j = 1, . . . , 6 indices of su(4) and  = 1, 2 indices of sl(2; r). the variation of the
vector zab under e6(6) is:16

zij = m
zi = i

i zm j  m
m zm  + 

j zim + ijm zm ,

zi + m n izm n .

(a.6)

(a.7)

from these equations it is possible to nd the form of the matrix x in the su(4)  sl(2; r)
basis:

x =   2[m

[i n ]

j]

2m n i i

ijm 
 + 

j

i

j ! .

(a.8)

n and 

here m
 are real and traceless matrices, that are the generators of su(4) and sl(2; r),
while m n i is real and totally antisymmetric in the indices mni. the physical states are
given by the non-compact generators of e6(6), which correspond to the symmetric parts of m
n
and 

, and the self-dual part of m n i. the self-duality condition for m n i is [21]

ijk = 

1
6

ijklm n lm n .

in a unitary usp(8) gauge, u can be written as

u = exp x,

(a.9)

(a.10)

parameters correspond to the 42 scalars.

where x = pa ata is given only by the 42 non compact generators of e6: these 42 independent
we are interested in the scalars m and  which are in the 6(2,2) of su(4) and transform as
a singlet and a 6 of the su(3)  su(4). turning them on breaks su(4) to su(3)  u(1). we
choose the following decomposition of the 27 in su(3)  u(1) basis [6]:

27  (cid:16)1(0,0), 3(4,0), 3(4,0), 8(0,0), 3(2,2), 3(2,2), 3(2,2), 3(2,2)(cid:17) ,

(a.11)

where the rst index gives the charges under the u(1)  su(4) and the second the charges
under the other u(1)  sl(2; r). with this choice of basis, the matrix x has the following
tensor ijklm n = ijklm n : ijk =
16the indices m, n, .. are raised with the invariant

vielbein and gamma matrices

to compute the potential and the tensions of the fundamental and d1-string we need to know
ab, where a, b are a couple of antisymmetric symplectic-traceless indices a, b =
the vielbein vab
1, ..., 8, representing the 27 of usp(8). this eld, being an element of e6/usp(8), carries both
the indices a, b = 1, . . . , 8 of the 27 of e6 and the indices a, b = 1, . . . , 8 of the 27 of usp(8).
according to ref.[21], one can go from the e6 basis to the usp(8) using the so(7) gamma
matrices, .

in the complex basis we are using, the vielbein is obtained by multiplying on the right the

matrix u by the following vector of gamma matrices:

wabcd = ij viabvjab,
wac = i (0)db wabcd,

as [21]

v =

8 h2wabw ab  wabcdw abcdi ,

where the usp(8) indices are raised and lowered with the matrix 0, as shown in ref. [21]. once
the vielbein are known, its evaluation is a lengthy but straightforward computation. plugging
vab

ab in the expressions (a.13),(a.15) and performing some gamma-matrix algebra one gets:
