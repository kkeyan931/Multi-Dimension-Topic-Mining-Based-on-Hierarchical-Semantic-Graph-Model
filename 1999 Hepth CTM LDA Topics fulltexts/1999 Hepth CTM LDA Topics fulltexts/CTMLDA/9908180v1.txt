abstract

we study the interaction between a tensionless (null) string and an
antisymmetric background eld bab using a 2-component spinor for-
malism. a geometric condition for the absence of such an interaction is
formulated. we show that only one gauge-invariant degree of freedom
of the eld bab does not satisfy this condition. identication of this
degree of freedom with the notoph eld  of ogievetskii-polubarinov-
kalb-ramond is suggested. application of a 2-component spinor for-
malism allows one a reduction of the complete system of non-linear
partial dierential equations and constraints governing the interacting
null string dynamics to a system of linear dierential equations for the
basis spinors of the spin-frame. we nd that total eect of the inter-
action is contained in a single derivation coecient which is identied
with the notoph eld.

i. introduction

recently, there has been considerable interest in the investigation of the string
and null string equations of motion in dierent backgrounds of external elds and
in curved spacetimes (e.g. [13] and references therein). finding the exact solutions
for the equations of motion in such systems is a rather dicult task, mainly due to
the non-linear character of the equations of motion, so it seems interesting to study
those situations in which these equations possess exact solutions. it is known that
the equations of motion for strings in 4d minkowski spacetime, null strings in some
backgrounds and for particular types of curved spacetimes can be solved exactly
[26]. being a zero-tension limit of strings [7], null strings possess simpler equations
of motion than those of strings and can be considered as a zero approximation with
the string tension as the perturbation parameter [810]. this explains our current
interest in this problem.

geometrically worldsheets of null strings are lightlike (null) 2-surfaces which
generalize worldlines of massless particles [7,1113]. by convention, null string in-
teractions with various elds can be analysed into two types. to the rst type we
attribute the interactions which violate the lightlike character of the worldsheets
and can lead to generation of non-zero tension [1418] . all other interactions fall
into the second type.
in particular, null string interactions with antisymmetric
background tensor elds are of the second type. as shown in [14], 2-component
spinors of 3d minkowski spacetime provide a particularly convenient framework for
studying the general solutions of null string equations of motion in arbitrary anti-
symmetric background elds bab(x). on the other hand, a convenience of adopting
2-component spinor description for spacelike and timelike strings in 4d minkowski
spacetime was demonstrated in [19] and for free null (super) strings and p-branes
in [20]. this formalism is based on the fundamental results of penroses twistor
programme [21] and is a part of the so-called twistor approach in the theory of
supersymmetric objects [2231]. from this viewpoint the goal of this article is to
study further the utility of such an approach in describing exact solutions of non-
linear equations of motion for extended objects in external elds. the rst signs
as to the eciency of this approach were found in [14] where the dynamics of null
strings in 3d minkowski spacetime and null membranes in 4d minkowski spacetime
in background antisymmetric elds bab(x) and babc(x) was investigated. it has been
shown that the contribution of these elds into the null string and null membrane
equations of motion can be annihilated by reparametrization of the corresponding
null worldsheets.

on the other hand, from the point of view of gauge eld theory for bab(x) in
3d minkowski spacetime and babc(x) in 4d minkowski spacetime these results are
natural ones since bab(x) and babc(x) are the pure gauge elds in the given dimen-
sions of spacetimes. duality relations bab = abcc and babc = abcdd allow exclusion
of the vector eld a from equations of motion by xing gauge parameters a and
ab of the corresponding u(1) internal group of gauge symmetry. nevertheless, the
non-trivial nature of results [14] lie in the fact that they were derived without using

2

the gauge symmetry described above. utilization of worldsheet virasoro symmetry
together with new gauge symmetries of the 2-component spinor formalism were suf-
cient for elimination of these pure gauge elds. these symmetries allow reduction
of the null string and null membrane non-linear equations of motion to linear and
exactly solvable ones. taking a pragmatical point of view it could be advantageous
to exclude all non-physical degrees of freedom of the external elds interacting with
extended objects by xing gauge conditions corresponding to the internal symmetry
group from the very beginning. however, this leads to the lorentz non-covariant
description which is disadvantageous on the quantum level.

our investigation suggests that 2-component spinor formalism allows one to sim-
plify the non-linear dynamics of strings and membranes propagating in external elds
or curved spacetimes without breaking the lorentz covariance and internal gauge
symmetry invariance of the description explicitly. we hope that simplications
achieved in the framework of such a description could provide the most relevant
choice of eective variables which would permit integration of non-linear motion
equations for p-branes in various spacetime dimensions.

assuming the correctness of the above-stated hypothesis we shall study non-
linear equations of motion of a tensionless string embedded into the background of
an antisymmetric eld bab(x) in 4d minkowski spacetime.
in this case the eld
bab(x) has physical degrees of freedom which cannot be eliminated by xing of u(1)
gauge symmetry. in what follows we have to keep in mind that the results discussed
in this paper depend on the dimension of spacetime [32].

we show below that the use of virasoro reparametrization symmetry and local
symmetries inherent in the 2-component spinor formalism provide a gauge invariant
possibility to exclude all non-physical degrees of freedom of the gauge eld bab(x).
it turns out that only one gauge-invariant physical degree of freedom inuences the
null string dynamics, and we identify this degree of freedom with the notoph eld
of ogievetskii-polubarinov-kalb-ramond [33,34].

we also formulate a geometric condition for the absence of interaction between
the tensionless string and background antisymmetric elds which is equivalent to the
condition that bab(x) is a pure gauge eld. this condition consists in the vanishing
of the scalar product of the 4-vector velocity vector xa with eld strength qa(x) of
the gauge eld bab(x).

similar to the case of the lund-regge geometrical approach [3540] we show that
null string equations of motion can be reduced to algebraic conditions on the coe-
cients of decomposition (the so-called derivation coecients) of the rst derivatives
of the basis spinors of a 2-component spin-frame (dyad) with respect to worldsheet
coordinates  and . then integrability conditions for the representation of the rst
derivatives of xa(, ) with respect to  and  start playing the role of the dynamical
equations.

we establish that the eect of interaction with the antisymmetric eld is con-
oa, and we interpret it as the no-
tained in one of the derivation coecients of
toph eld . from the point of view of the gauge eld theory approach [3739]
these derivation coecients have physical meaning of 2d yang-mills or higgs

3

elds. therefore the notoph eld nds interpretation as an additional component
of 2d yang-mills-higgs eld.

the resulting equations of motion of the null string in a background of antisym-
metric elds can be written as a system of linear second-order partial dierential
equations for the basis spinors of the dyad. this shows that the 2-component spinor
formalism can be successfully employed for the purpose of linearization of non-linear
equations of motion of tensionless strings interacting with background antisymmet-
ric gauge elds in 4d minkowski spacetime.

ii. equations of motion

let us consider the action of a null string in an external antisymmetric eld

bab(x). in the spinor form it can be rewritten as follows:

s = z hxaa

oaoa  121xa1a

12xa2a

2ba1a2a

1a

2(x)id2,

(2.1)

1a

2, xaa and d2 represent, respectively, the eld bab, the coordinates
where ba1a2a
of the null string xa(, ) and the area element d d of the worldsheet. we assume
that  = (, ) is a smooth parametrization of the null-string worldsheet, choose
  =  = 1, ab = diag(+   ) and use the notation  = /. the
coordinates  on the worldsheet are dimensionless and we assume the worldsheet
vector density () to have the dimensions of inverse length. the density  ensures
invariance of action (2.1) under arbitrary non-degenerate reparametrisations of the
null string worldsheet [18].
interaction constant  has the dimensions of inverse
length. spinor elds oa and a form a basis for 2-dimensional complex vector space
and obey the normalization conditions

oaa = (oaa) = , oaoa = aa = 0,

(2.2)

where (xaa) represents a possibility of rescaling of the dyad element a at each
spacetime point xaa. the relation

ba1a

1a2a

2 = ba1a2a

2 = ba2a1a

1a

2a

1

(2.3)

holds for the antisymmetric tensor eld bab and we introduce aa = /xaa,
xaa =  xaa, xaa = xaa and

3[aaba1a2a

1a

2 + a1a

12xa2a

2[aaba1a2a

and complex conjugate of them. the rst equation in (2.5) and its complex conjugate
imply

xaa

= eoaoa

,

(2.6)

where e() is an arbitrary real-valued function with transformation properties of a
scalar worldsheet density. assuming that  is a nowhere-zero function we rewrite
this equation as

xaa

=

e
 oaoa




 xaa

.

taking into account the second equation in (2.5) we obtain

xaa

oaoa = 0.

this equation yields the representation for the spin-tensor xaa in the form1

xaa

= oara

+ raoa

,

where condition oara 6= 0 is imposed on the spinor eld ra.

action (2.1) is invariant with respect to the following transformations:

oa = oa, a = a + uoa,

and

oa = evoa, a = eva,  = e(v+v)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

with complex-valued functions u() and v(). transformations (2.10) and (2.11) are
usually referred to as null rotations about the null direction corresponding to oa
and as boost-rotations, respectively. expanding spinor eld ra in the basis (oa, a)
as ra = poa + qa, where functions p() and q() are complex-valued, representing
q in the polar form q = |q| exp(i) and using (2.9) we nd

xaa

= (p + p)oaoa

+ |q|(eioaa

+ eiaoa

).

(2.12)

carrying out successive transformations (2.10) and (2.11) with parameters
u = |q|1 p exp(i) and v = [ln( /e) + i]/2 we obtain

xaa

= oaoa




 xaa

, xaa

= |q|(oaa

+ aoa

).

(2.13)

1representations (2.7) and (2.9) imply x2 = (/ )2 x2 and xx = (/ )x2. hence,
the determinant of the induced metric on the null string worldsheet vanishes identically
( x2 x2  ( xx)2 = 0). this veries that the action principle (2.1) provides a description of
a null string worldsheet.

5

here we have not put any tildes over the basis spinors, because motion equations
(2.5) are invariant with respect to transformations (2.10) and (2.11). using the
possibility of rescaling the dyad element a

oa = oa, a = a,  = ,

(2.14)

we incorporate factor |q| into a and write (2.13) in the form

xaa

= oaoa




 xaa

, xaa

= oaa

+ aoa

.

(2.15)

using (2.15) we represent the last equation in (2.5) as

(oaoa) = i(qab  ob 

oa  oaqbaob),

(2.16)

where spin-tensor qaa corresponds to vector qa = abcd[bbcd] with 3![abbc] =
abcddef gebf g and we take 0123 = 0123 = 1. for this duality relation we shall
call qaa the eld strength of the gauge potential bab.

invariance of action (2.1) under arbitrary reparametrizations of the worldsheet
implies (via the second noethers theorem [41,40]) that the solutions of the motion
equations depend upon two arbitrary real-valued functions. we x one of them
using the condition

 = 0.

(2.17)

the null string equations of motion take the form

xaa

= oaoa

, xaa

= oaa

+ aoa

, ( oaoa

) = f aa

,

(2.18)

where we have introduced the notation

faa = i(qab  ob 

oa  oaobqba).

(2.19)

by analogy with the case of a charged particle in a background electromagnetic eld
we call faa the lorentz force produced by the antisymmetric gauge potential bab.
for the purposes of future analysis we write the second equation of system (2.18) as

xaa

+ (ln| |) xaa

= ( )1f aa

.

representation (2.18) for xaa and xaa results in the virasoro constraints

x2 = 0 and

xx = 0

appearing in the standard theory of null strings.

(2.20)

(2.21)

iii. null string identifies antisymmetric field as

notoph

let us analyse null string equations of motion (2.18)  (2.20) and constraints
(2.21). the presence of the lorentz force f aa makes them dierent from that of
the free null string [1113].

we start by showing that projections of f aa on vectors xaa and xaa tangent
to the null string worldsheet vanish. taking into account normalization (2.2) we nd
the projections of the force f aa onto the spin-tensor basis elements oaoa, oaa,
oaa and aa

f aa
f aa

oaoa = xaaf aa
oaa = i||2oaoaqaa

= 0, f aa
, f aa

aa = i||2(oaa  oaa)qaa
aoa = i||2oaoaqaa

.

,

(3.1)

therefore, we obtain

(oaa + aoa)f aa

= xaaf aa

= 0.

(3.2)

this shows that the force f aa possesses only two non-zero projections onto the
moving tetrad associated with each point of the null string worldsheet. for the
sake of brevity, we dene the second spacelike member of the moving tetrad by the
condition

kaa

= i(oaa

 oa

a).

(3.3)

evidently kaa is orthogonal to xaa and xaa. then, subtracting the third and
fourth equations in (3.1), the second non-zero projection of f aa is given by

kaaf aa

= 2||2oaoaqaa

.

(3.4)

now we are in a position to nd the number of physical degrees of freedom taking
part in the interaction between the gauge eld bab and the tensionless string. as
we show below, this number is equal to one.

first, we consider the case when the eld strength qaa is restricted by the

condition

qaa

oaoa = qaa

xaa = 0.

(3.5)

in this case, the right-hand side of equation (3.4) vanishes and we are left with only
one non-zero component of the lorentz force, f aaaa = ||2kaaqaa. taking
into account the rst pair of equations in system (2.18) and equation (3.3) we can
write the general solution of equation (3.5) for qaa as follows:

qaa

= s xaa

+ r1 xaa

+ r2kaa

.

(3.6)

here s(, ), r1(, ) and r2(, ) are arbitrary real-valued functions. equation (3.6)
shows that under condition (3.5) the eld strength qaa expands into the triple of

7

vectors xaa, xaa and kaa of the moving tetrad. at a given point on the null
string worldsheet vectors xaa and xaa dene the ag plane associated with the
agpole xaa [21]. we note in passing that this ag plane lies in the tangent plane
of the null string worldsheet. the vector kaa can be obtained from xaa by rotating
the latter through a right angle about the agpole xaa. this can also be achieved
as a result of performing transformations (2.11) with parameter v = i/4. under
such transformations oa 7 exp (i/4)oa and a 7 exp (i/4)a which means that
xaa 7 kaa. rotations of the ag plane through arbitrary angles sweep out a null
hypersurface spanned by the three mutually orthogonal vectors xaa, xaa and kaa.
the null character of this hypersurface follows immediately from the null property
of vector xaa which is also normal to the hypersurface. expansion (3.6) means that
the eld strength qaa restricted by condition (3.5) belongs to this hypersurface at
each point of the null string worldsheet. using the expression for f aaaa from
system (3.1) together with representation (3.6) and equation (2.20) we obtain

xaa

aa = ( )1||2(   2r2).

(3.7)

we eliminate the right-hand side of this equation by xing the second gauge condi-
tion corresponding to the remaining reparametrization symmetry [14] of the virasoro
constraints (2.21)

 =  (, ) and  = ().

(3.8)

the required gauge choice is given by the following condition on the worldsheet
density component  :

  2r2 = 0  

x =  (0, ) + 2z 

0

r2 d.

(3.9)

the null string equations of motion in the background of antisymmetric elds re-
stricted by condition (3.5) take the form of free null string equations of motion

xa = 0.

(3.10)

therefore, external antisymmetric elds of the form (3.6) can be excluded from the
interaction with the null string by xing suitable gauge conditions. the possibility
of xing such gauge conditions corresponds to the local symmetries of the null string
action functional (2.1). these local symmetries describe the reparametrization free-
dom of the null string worldsheet and arbitrariness (2.10) and (2.11) inherent in the
choice of the dyad oa, a. we conclude that antisymmetric background elds bab
obeying condition (3.5) can be treated as pure gauge elds in the present formalism.
in the general case the vector qaa is given by expansion in the basis of moving

tetrad

qaa

= s xaa

+ r1 xaa

+ r2kaa

+ aa

.

(3.11)

the tetrad is produced by addition of the null vector aa to the vectors xaa, xaa,
kaa. in the view of the statement proved above the components s, r1 and r2 of the

8

eld strength qaa does not contribute to the interaction with the null string. hence,
only one component, , of the eld strength qaa is essential for the interaction
and cannot be excluded by any gauge transformation. this implies that for the
purposes of interaction with a null string the behaviour of antisymmetric gauge
eld bab is classically equivalent to that of the real-valued scalar eld. the scalar
eld  describes single gauge-invariant physical degree of freedom which is naturally
associated with the notoph  a massless particle of zero helicity [33]. our conclusion
agrees with results of kalb and ramond [34]. they found that tensor interactions
between closed tensile strings are eectively equivalent to those of between a string
and an antisymmetric background eld bab which has only one physical degree of
freedom on its mass-shell. this conclusion was derived in the framework of wheeler-
feynman action-at-a-distance approach [43] generalized to the case of strings. under
such an approach physical elds appear as secondary eective variables composed
of worldline or worldsheet coordinates of the interacting particles and strings2. in
spite of this fact kalb and ramond had proven that their results are equivalent to
the results of the eld theory for the eld bab.

in this connection let us briey recall that the theory of an antisymmetric gauge

eld bab is characterized by the following gauge symmetry:

b

ab = bab + ab  ba.

(3.12)

this is also one of the symmetries of the interacting null string action (2.1). the
equation of motion for bab is

a fa = 0,

(3.13)

where fa = abcd[bbcd]. dening a real-valued scalar eld  by the relation fa = a 
we can represent (3.13) in the form

2  = 0.

(3.14)

thus, we see that antisymmetric eld bab has only one gauge-invariant degree of
freedom which can be described by a real-valued massless scalar eld.

comparison of this description with the picture of the null string interaction
considered above shows that we can identify the vector qa and the corresponding
real-valued scalar  with f a and , respectively. this identication is possible
because of the fact that null string equations of motion (2.18) together with the
remaining reparametrization symmetry (3.8) play a similar role to that of equation
(3.13) in the theory of propagating antisymmetric eld bab.
in our analysis we
do not derive the klein-gordon equation for the eld . it was, however, shown

2it is interesting to observe at this point that compatibility of the action-at-a-distance
approach with global supersymmetry in minkowski spacetime has been recently shown
in [45] (see also [44]).

9

in [46] that wave equations for yang-mills and other types of background elds
which belong to the string spectrum appear as conditions ensuring the absence
of a conformal anomaly on the quantum level. since the quantum eld theory of
tensionless (super)strings and (super)membranes is free of conformal anomalies [20],
the klein-gordon equation for the eld  must appear in the quantum picture as a
consequence of this result.

iv. analysis of equations of motion

having established the number of the physical degrees of freedom for the anti-
symmetric eld interacting with the null string we can now continue the analysis of
the null string motion equations (2.18).

firstly, the representations of xaa and xaa must obey some compatibility con-
ditions. since ( xaa) is equal to (xaa) the spinors oa and a satisfy the following
relation:

oaoa

+ oaoa

= oaa

+ oaa

+ a oa

+ aoa

.

multiplying both sides of equation (4.1) by oaoa we get

which yields

 oaoa + oa

oa = 0,

oaoa + i = 0,

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

where () is an arbitrary real-valued function. allowing for (2.2), one can write

oa = i oa  ia.

(4.4)

here () is an arbitrary complex-valued function and the multiplier i is introduced
for future convenience. substituting (4.4) into (4.1) and projecting the resulted
equation on oaa we nd

and it follows that

(a  i a  oa)oa = 0

a  i a  oa = oa.

substituting again (4.4) and (4.6) into (4.1) we obtain

 = i,

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

where () is an arbitrary real-valued function. thus, compatibility condition (4.1)
results in the pair of equations for the basis spinors oa and a

10

oa = i oa  ia,
a = ioa + i a + oa.

(4.8)

secondly, we nd that projection of both sides of the last equation in (2.18),
or equivalently, of equation (2.20) on the agpole direction oaoa vanishes and its
projection onto xaa gives equation (4.2) by virtue of using (3.2). projection of
(2.20) onto the remaining members of the tetrad, kaa and aa gives

 oaa + oaa
 oaoa  oa oa

= 0,
= 2i||4(

x)1,

(4.9)

where we took into account equations (3.1)  (3.4) and gauge condition (3.9). using
representation (4.8) for oa in system (4.9) we derive that () is a real-valued
function and () is given by

 = ||2(

x)1.

(4.10)

we observe that in this approach the null string motion equations (2.20) result
in simple algebraic conditions which reduce arbitrariness in the denition of the
component  in the dyad decomposition of the spinor elds oa and a and identify
the component  with the notoph eld . these components dene the dynamics
of the dyad moving frame on the null string worldsheet. the same situation arises
in the lund-regge geometric approach to the dynamics of strings as embedded
surfaces in spacetime [3539,42]. in this approach the string equations of motion
are transformed into algebraic relations for the rst and second fundamental forms
of the string worldsheet, and the integrability conditions for the moving frames
associated with the worldsheet start playing a main dynamical role. in our case the
integrability conditions are given by equations (4.8). allowing for reality of  and
the interpretation of  given above we can re-express them as

oa = i oa  ia,
a = ioa + i a + oa.

(4.11)

from geometric point of view these equations are similar to the well known
maurer-cartan equations for the special case of isotropic 2-surfaces embedded into
4d minkowski spacetime in the background of antisymmetric elds. the formula-
tion of the lund-regge approach in terms of cartans theory of moving frames was
considered in [3739], where a connection between strings and 2d yang-mills-higgs
theories was also established. according to this gauge formulation the notoph eld
nds interpretation as some additional component of the worldsheet yang-mills-
higgs eld.

we can further simplify equations (4.11) by choosing spinor variables ua(, )

and va(, )

oa = eiua,

a = eiva,

(4.12)

11

where the scalar products of new spinors are

uava = e2i, ua va

= e2i .

using these spinors we rewrite equations (4.11) in the form

ua = iva,
va = iua + ua,

(4.13)

(4.14)

where  =  +  is a real-valued function of  and . if we re-express va through ua
using the rst equation in system (4.14) and substitute the result into the second
equation then we obtain a homogeneous second-order partial dierential equation
for the basis spinor ua

ua  (ln||) ua + iua  ua = 0.

(4.15)

solutions of this equation dene the second basis spinor va via the rst equation in
system (4.14). equation (4.15) must be accompanied by corresponding initial data
and appropriate periodicity conditions in the case of closed strings. introducing real
a and imaginary a parts of the spinor eld ua

ua = a + ia

together with linear dierential operators l and l

l = 2

  (ln||)  , l = 

allows to write the null string equations of motion in the matrix form,

  l l

l !  a

l

a ! = 0.

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

equation (4.15), or its matrix representation (4.18), is nal equation which com-
pletely determines evolution of the tensionless string in the background of antisym-
metric elds. solutions of these equations will be studied in another paper.

v. conclusion

we studied the dynamics of the null string embedded in an arbitrary background
of antisymmetric elds and formulated a condition for the absence of interaction with
such elds. according to this condition the null string identies the eld strength of
the antisymmetric eld as the notoph  a massless particle of zero helicity. we show
that non-linear equations of motion of the null string in background antisymmetric
elds can be reduced to algebraic constraints and integrability conditions for 2-
component spinor representation of xaa and xaa, and the integrability conditions
play the role of dynamical equations. the total eect of the null string interaction
with such elds is contained in a single derivation coecient of the decomposition

12

of oa into the dyad basis. this derivation coecient is given by projection oa on
the dyad basis spinor oa, and we interpret this coecient as the notoph eld. in
the case of free null string this derivation coecient vanishes. therefore, we can
detect a notoph eld with the aid of a tensionless string. under the gauge eld
theory interpretation of the lund-regge geometric approach suggested in [37,38]
these derivation coecients play the role of the components of the 2d yang-mills-
higgs eld associated with the holonomy group of the string worldsheet. thus from
the point of view of 2d worldsheet physics the appearance of the notoph eld means
the presence of an additional component of the 2d yang-mills eld associated with
the null string embedded into the background of antisymmetric elds.

we also nd that equations of motion dening the dynamics of the null string
can be transformed into a linear homogeneous system of second-order partial dier-
ential equations. hence, 2-component spinor formalism provides a natural geometric
framework for reduction of non-linear null string equations of motion in the back-
ground of antisymmetric elds to linear ones. at this point, it would be interesting
to consider generalizations of these results to the case of tensionless p(d)-branes
propagating in external antisymmetric elds of higher rank in higher dimensions of
spacetime.
