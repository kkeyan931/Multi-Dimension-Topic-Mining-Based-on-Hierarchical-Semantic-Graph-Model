(1) scales 1. natural explanation, one could conjecture colorless massless excitation saturates expression vacuum energy density (1). however, pure gluodynamics generates mass gap physical massless excitations model. thus, origin eq. (1) seems conundrum. work intend elucidate eld-theoretic origin eq.

(1) pure ym model and, fact, identify degrees freedom responsible theta dependent vacuum energy density. quasi-classical approach theta dependence calculated using instantons {$9802067$}. simplest approximation non-interacting instantons theta angle enters euclidean space partition function following form: exp(cid:16) 82 g2 i(cid:17) exp(cid:16) n 82 i(cid:17) , (2) g stands strong coupling constant. denotes hoofts coupling n g2 kept xed large n limit. expression vanishes large n limit, theta dependence (2). however, conclusion cannot extrapolated infrared region model. limitations expression (2) prevent one so. indeed, quasi-classical approximation valid limit small coupling constant (see, instance, discussions ref. {$9802067$}). quantum corrections taken account coupling constant g2 (2) becomes scale dependent quantity. fact, depend upon instanton size g2 = g2(). small size instantons running coupling small quasi-classical approximation (2) holds. however, large size instantons, i.e. large couplings, even clear whether notion single instanton legitimate approximation. overlap instantons big case complicated eld congurations relevant description physical phenomena {$9802067$}. event, expression (2) longer reliable strong coupling limit. thus, conclusion theta dependence goes away large n limit cannot justied. one way study infrared region look appropriate composite colorless excitations notion asymptotic state used. start searching excitations pure yang-mills theory. proceed, let us recall topological susceptibility, x , nonzero number pure gluodynamics: x = z h0|t k(x)k(0)|0i d4x 6= 0 . (3) here, k denotes chern-simons current related topological charge density 322 f f f f , dual strength-tensor dened f = q = k = g2 1 2 f. quantities dened minkowski space. value x large n pure ym theory determines meson mass full qcd massless quarks. relation, called witten-veneziano formula, written m2 x , f f 2 though minkowski space-time q meaning topological charge density and, moreover, diers euclidean denition topological charge density i, formally keep name letter simplicity. 3 meson decay constant {$9802067$}. follows prove convenient introduce new variable rewriting expression topological charge density q terms four-index (four-form) tensor eld h : f f = q = h 4! , four-form eld h eld strength three-form potential c: h = c c c c. c eld dened composite operator gluon elds aa : c = 1 162 (aa aa aa aa aa aa + 2fabcaa ab ac ). (4) (5) (6) here, fabc denote structure constants corresponding su(n) gauge group. right-left derivative expression dened ab a(b) (a)b. notice, gauge transformation parameter c eld gauge invariant quantity; a, three-form eld transforms c c + , a. however, one check expression eld strength aa h gauge invariant. aa known time {$9711200$} c eld propagates long-range correla- tions topological susceptibility nonzero theory. easiest way see turn notion kogut-susskind pole {$9711200$}. let us consider correlator vacuum topological susceptibility nonzero momentum. case x dened zero momentum limit correlator two chern-simons currents multiplied two momenta: x = lim q0 qq z eiqxh0|t k(x)k(0)|0id4x. (7) since expression nonzero, must correlator two chern-simons currents develops pole momentum vanishes, kogut-susskind pole {$9711200$}. given correlator two chern-simons currents pole chern- simons current three-form c eld related, one concludes c eld also nonzero coulomb propagator {$9711200$}. thus, c eld behaves massless collective excitation propagating long-range interaction {$9711200$}. properties, large n limit, summarized following eective action c eld: sef f = 1 2 4! x z h 2 d4x 3! z c dx dx dx + high dim. (8) numerical value x also found within framework qcd sum rule {$9802067$} calcula- tions {$9711200$}, well lattice studies {$9802067$}. below, unless otherwise stated, distinguish x large n limit. constant contact term denition x also omitted simplicity. 4 rst term expression yields correct coulomb propagator three-form c eld. second term usual cp odd term initial ym action written surface integral spatial innity . notice higher dimensional terms explicitly written expression. might two types higher dimensional contributions (8). first all, terms higher powers derivatives elds. terms suppressed momenta massless three-form eld contribute zero momentum vacuum energy system. addition, might higher dimensional terms additional derivatives. next section present contributions show suppressed higher powers 1/n. follows going study large n eective action given eq. (8) . particular, calculate ground state energy system large n limit using eective action (8). fact, derive eq. (1). turn calculation let us mention maxwells equations free four- form eld-strength h yield constant solution (3 + 1)-dimensional space-time {$9711200$}. reason follows. four-form potential one independent degree freedom four-dimensional space-time, let us call . then, four maxwells equations written terms eld require eld independent four space-time coordinates, thus solution space-time constant. result, free h eld propagates dynamical degrees freedom (3 + 1)-dimensions. however, eld responsible positive vacuum energy density various models quantum field theory (see ref. {$9711200$}). thus, studying classical equations motion h eld one determine value ground state energy given congurations h. going solve explicitly classical equations motion eective action (8). then, energy density associated solutions calculated. let us start equations motion. taking variation action (8) respect c(z) eld one gets h(z) = x z (4)(z x) dx dx dx. (9) equation solved exactly four-dimensional space-time {$9711200$}. solution sum particular solution inhomogeneous equation general solution corresponding homogeneous equation: h(z) = x z (4)(z x) dx dx dx dx + b . (10) integration constant b, nonzero, induces additional cp violation beyond existed angle. however, periodicity angle respect shifts 2 (integer) allows nonzero b proportional 2z. result, general solution equation motion reads follows: action (8) eective action wilsonian sense. rather related generating functional one-particle-irreducible diagrams composite eld large n limit. eective action eq. (8) quantized loop diagrams action taken account calculating higher order greens functions. analogous eective action cp even part theory constructed refs. {$9711200$}, {$9711200$}, (see also ref. {$9711200$}). 5 h = ( + 2k) x . (11) thus, dierent vacua labeled integer k order parameter vacua large n limit written as: hf fik = ( + 2k) x . (12) next step let us compute vacuum energy associated solution given eq. (11). density energy-momentum tensor action (8) takes form = 1 3! x using expression (11) one calculates corresponding energy density ek (cid:18)h h 1 8 gh 2 (cid:19) . ek() = 1 2 ( + 2k)2 x . (13) (14) since h eld propagate dynamical degrees freedom expression total energy density system given action (8) . go let us stop discuss consequences eq. (14). first all, let us notice result (14), well eq. (1), valid limit innite n. next section calculate subleading order corrections eqs. (1,14) argue expressions also used good approximation large nite n. constant c emerging (1) related topological susceptibility follows: x|n = 2c. thus, vacuum energy (1,14) dened vacuum uctuations topological charge measured x . obtained minimizing (14) respect k (1): crucial feature (14) denes innite number vacua. true vacuum e0() = 1 2 x mink ( + 2k)2 . expression periodic respect shifts 2z also smooth function except = {$9802067$} (see also discussions below). thus, innite number notice total ym energy density contain negative constant related nonzero value gluon condensate {$9802067$}. constant subtracted expression energy discussed work. energy density (14) normalized e0( = 0) = 0, k = 0 discussed {$9711200$}. one might wonder whether result obtained one treats constant multiply- ing q lagrangian, phase states acquire topologically non-trivial gauge transformations. case arbitrary integration constant eq. (10) chosen way would guarantee proper dependence vev topological charge density. would leave results discussion without modications. 6 false vacua theory {$9802067$}. fate states discussed section 4. 3. large n qcd calculation section consider full qcd three quark avors. going write low-energy eective lagrangian case gradually decouple quarks taking quark masses innity. resulting eective lagrangian giving energy density pure yang-mills theory. large n expansion eective lagrangian qcd three avors takes form {$9802067$}: l(u, u , q) = l0(u, u ) + q2(x) + q(x) + 1 2 x 1 q(x) tr (cid:16)ln u ln u (cid:17) + 2 b tr (mu + u ) + . . . , 22 (15) u denotes avor group matrix pseudoscalar mesons, l0 denotes part lagrangian contains meson elds {$9802067$}, b constant related quark condensate, stands meson mass matrix (for recent discussions eective chiral lagrangian approach see ref. {$9802109$}). higher order terms (15) suppressed quadratic higher powers 1/n. order study vacuum properties, concentrate low-momentum approximation. lagrangian presented used solve u(1) problem {$9802067$}. indeed, eld q enters lagrangian quadratic approximation integrated out. result, avor singlet meson, , gets additional contribution mass term. leads witten-veneziano relation solution u(1) problem without instantons {$9802067$}. present case would like follow opposite way. namely, going make quarks heavy integrate keeping eld q lagrangian. limit mq one nds . thus, low-energy eective lagrangian left mesons integrated take form: le(q) = 1 2 x q2(x) + q(x) + (cid:16)2 qcd 2 , 2q2 6 qcd , 1 n 2(cid:17) . (16) rewriting eld q terms massless tensor c previous section, one nds expression (16) nothing lagrangian presented (8). thus, higher order terms neglected (8) could contribute vacuum energy zero momenta would correspond higher corrections 1/n. fact, subleading corrections eective lagrangian (15) also found {$9802109$}. terms proportional (with corresponding dimensionful coecients) following expressions: const. n 2 q2 tr (u u ), const. n 2 q4 . (17) terms listed suppressed eective lagrangian factor 1/n 2. next step, include terms (17) full eective lagrangian integrate heavy meson elds out. net result procedure terms proportional q4 appear eective lagrangian pure ym theory. this, turn, modies 7 equation motion single component h considered previous section. performing calculation vacuum energy manner section 2 nd following result energy density: ek() = 1 2 x (cid:16) + 2k(cid:17)2 + const. n 2 x (cid:16) + 2k(cid:17)4 + o(cid:16) 1 n 3(cid:17). (18) expression arbitrary constant emerges result integration equation motion. notice topological susceptibility expression also dened corresponding order large n expansion: x = 2c + x1/n + x2/n 2. thus, expressions (14,18) could principle give reasonable approximation big enough otherwise nite n. true vacuum energy density, e0(), obtained min- imizing expression (18) respect k (1). then, e0() satises relation 2 e0() |=0 = x , matter value arbitrary constant (18). 4. dynamics false vacua section discuss dynamics false vacua present theory. accordance (14,18) innite number vacua given value theta angle {$9802067$}. clearly, degenerate. true vacuum state dened minimizing expressions (14,18) respect k. states false vacua greater values energy density. potential barrier separates given false vacuum state true one. thus, false vacuum general decay true state process bubble nucleation {$9802109$}. decay rates vacua evaluated recently ref. {$9802109$}. section analyze fate false vacua dierent realizations initial conditions system placed. sake simplicity discussing transitions vacuum states labeled k k dierent values integers. rst two cases considered section studied refs. {$9802067$} {$9802109$}, include completeness. 4.1. false vacua k 1 subsection consider system initial state exists false vacuum k order 1. let us start case n large nite number formula (14) (or (18)) still good approximation. since exists true vacuum state less energy, false vacuum decay true one via bubble nucleation process. say, nite probability form bubble true vacuum state inside. shell bubble domain wall separates false clear, however, numerical value constant, whether fact nonzero. decay go euclidean bounce solution {$9802109$}. though existence bounce case easy understand within eld theory context, nevertheless, one could motivated brane construction object appears sixbrane bubble wrapped certain space {$9802067$}. 8 state true one. dynamical question discuss whether favorable energetically create expand bubble. let us study energy balance case hand. creating shell bubble one looses amount energy equal surface area bubble multiplied tension shell. hand, true vacuum state created inside bubble, thus, one gains amount energy equal dierence energies false true states. energy balance two eects denes whether bubble formed, and, whether whole false vacuum transform true one expanding bubble innity. let us start volume energy density. amount energy density gained creating bubble is: e = 1 2 x h( + 2)2 2i = 2 x ( + ). thus, e scales 1 large n limit long volume bubble nite. let us turn surface energy lost. energy dened as: es = td (surface area) . (19) tension wall adjacent vacua, td, scale td n large n limit {$9802067$}. hence, surface energy also scale n. thus, process creation nite volume bubble large n limit energetically favorable. indeed, amount energy lost creating shell bigger amount gained. terms false vacuum decay width means width process suppressed large n limit {$9802109$}: volume exp(cid:16) 4(cid:17), (20) stands positive constant {$9802109$}. thus, one concludes limit n false vacua k 1 stable {$9802067$}. 4.2. false vacua k n study fate false vacua k n. discuss possibility vacua decay state k k k n k + k n. previous subsection, going study energy balance bubble nucleation process. amount volume energy density gained creating bubble large n limit scales follows: e x n 2. thus, volume energy gained increases n 2. let us turn surface energy lost nucleating bubble. dened e (surface area), denotes tension domain wall interpolating vacua labeled = subsection assume 6= . case = considered below. 9 k k. since k k n vacua neighboring ones. thus, general, reason expect tension wall interpolating vacua scales might scale n 2 (as energy generic conguration model n. n 2 degrees freedom). however, even case n 2 volume energy gained least order surface energy lost. hence, energetically favorable increase radius bubble (since volume energy scales cubic power radius surface energy scales quadratic power eective size). thus, bubble nucleation process suppressed false vacua k n eventually decay true ground state. note, state k = n well decay neighboring vacuum k = n 1 subsequently allowed turn ground state. 4.3. parallel domain walls subsection consider special case vacua present simulta- neously initial state model. achieved, instance, placing space innite number parallel domain walls separating dierent vacua other. rather convenient picture walls parallel planes. vacuum state sandwiched corresponding two domain walls (two planes) separating state neighboring vacua. domain labeled k accordance (14,18) characterized corresponding value vacuum energy. furthermore, order parameter hf fi takes dierent values vacua accordance (12). let us turn true vacuum state. simplicity assume state given k = 0 (which corresponds || less ). corresponding vacuum energy lowest one. consider two states adjacent true vacuum. states energy density bigger true vacuum. thus, constant pressure acting domain walls separating true vacuum adjacent false ones. pressure tend expand domain true vacuum. fact, large nite n, pressure indeed expand spatial region true vacuum moving apart centers domain walls sandwiching state. eect happening two adjacent vacua. indeed, let us calculate jump energy density two vacua labeled k k: ekk = 2 x (k k) (cid:16) + (k + k)(cid:17) . (21) far n large nite, walls start accelerate. farther wall located true vacuum (i.e. larger sum k + k), bigger initial acceleration wall going be; i.e., walls start move apart following initial acceleration: akk ym (k k)  n . (22) nite n walls moving spatial innity whole space eventually lled true vacuum state. hand, n picture bit dierent. number interesting cases consider: first let us set kk = 1 k , k 1. then, limit n acceleration akk 0. thus, neighboring walls stand still initial velocity. physical 10 reason behavior follows: though constant pressure order 1 acting wall, nevertheless, wall cannot moved mass per unit surface area wall tends innity limit n . second interesting case would constant pressure produced energy jump neighboring vacua order n. case possible accelerate walls speed light send spatial innity. indeed, k k = 1 k + k n, wall two vacua starts moving non-vanishing acceleration scales follows: akk ym (k + k) n o(1). (23) thus, walls eventually approaching spatial innity speed light even limit innite n. addition eects emphasized might also decays false vacua happening particular domain. discussed previous subsections, large nite n false vacua nucleating bubbles energetically favorable phases inside expanding bubbles innity. thus, large nite n, two eects eliminate false vacua: moving walls sweeping states innity, and, addition, vacua decaying via bubble nucleation processes. happens innite n? learned innite number domains stay stable limit corresponding false vacua would decay exponential suppression. thus, innite number inequivalent spatial regions separated domain walls. consider one regions sandwiched two domain walls. three-form eld c couple walls large n eective action case look follows: = se + xi=k, k+1 zwi c dx dx dx, (24) se dened (8), stands coupling three-form potential corre- sponding domain wall; wi denotes worldvolume wall. case domain wall regarded source corresponding three-form potential. reminiscent happens large n supersymmetric ym model {$9802109$}. 4.4. domain walls = = , initial classical lagrangian cp invariant. indeed, cp transforma- tions = goes . since angles equivalent, cp symmetry lagrangian. however, accordance (12), symmetry spontaneously broken vacuum theory. thus, one nds following two degenerate true vacua: ek=0 = ek=1 = 1 2 x 2 . (25) grateful gia dvali pointed me. 11 two vacua labeled order parameter (12). k = 0 state hf fi = x k = 1 state hf fi = x . result spontaneous breaking discrete symmetry domain wall separating two vacua. let us consider case discussed previous section. namely, let us choose initial condition system state possible vacua simultaneously realized space. is, innite number domain walls (parallel planes) dividing space innite number domains dierent values vacuum energy density labeled k. mentioned above, two domains equal minimal energy density given (25). domain wall separating two vacua, see below, somewhat special. accordance discussions previous subsection, large nite n, walls merging false vacua tend rush spatial innity. nal stable state model described space separated two parts single domain wall. left (right) wall one discovers phase k = 1 corresponding order parameter hf fi = x , and, right (left) wall one nds state k = 0 hf fi = x . vacuum energies two states degenerate. case innite n picture slightly dierent. elucidated previous subsection, innite number stable vacua. domain wall separating two true vacua regarded case xed plane z2 transformations coordinate transverse plane. three-form eld c able couple wall manner discussed previous subsection. picture, interpreted string theory approach, looks much like one orientifold plane separating mirror d-branes sides {$9802109$}. 5. comment string theory vs. field theory approach found section 2 theta dependent vacuum energy (1) related correlator (3) measuring vacuum uctuations topological charge. question arises whether seen original string theory computation {$9802067$}. going discuss string theory calculation indicates vacuum energy (1) indeed related vacuum uctuations topological charge. fact, argue related instantons carrying d0-brane charge type iia fourbrane construction four-dimensional ym model. begin let us recall theta dependent vacuum energy appears brane construction four-dimensional ym model {$9802067$}. one starts type iia superstring theory r4 s1 r5, n coincident d4-branes {$9803131$}. d4-brane worldvolume assumed r4 s1 fermion boundary conditions s1 chosen way low-energy theory worldvolume pure non-supersymmetric u(n) ym theory {$9803131$}. dual description, large n limit su(n) part theory studied string theory certain background {$9711200$}. shown ref. {$9802067$} theta dependent vacuum energy (1) arises dual string description due u(1) gauge eld bm , = 1, .., 5. nd corresponds original gauge theory language recall u(1) eld nothing ramond-ramond (rr) one- form type iia theory. furthermore, gauge theory realized type iia fourbrane construction, wess-zumino-witten (wzw) term present worldvolume eective action denes correspondence gauge theory operators one side string theory ramond-ramond elds side. case hand 12 worldvolume wzw term looks follows: swzw = 1 82 zv b trf f, (26) v denotes worldvolume wrapped fourbrane, v r4 s1. accordance general principles large n ads/cft correspondence {$9711200$} classical action rr one-form string theory side denes ym correlation functions composite operator f f (since operator couples corresponding rr eld (26)). moreover, two-point correlator topological charge density f f , coincides x (3) contact term {$9802067$}, recently calculated using ads/cft correspondence supergravity analyses rr one-form bm {$9802150$}. thus, surprising theta dependent vacuum energy dened rr one-form string theory calculation related nonzero value topological susceptibility (3) gauge theory studies. physical reason correspondence, mentioned above, special property gauge theory instantons fourbrane construction. indeed, accordance (26) rr one-form couples topological charge density f f , hand rr one-form couples denition d0-branes. thus, gauge theory instantons case carry zerobrane charge. physical reason correspondence discussed above. 6. conclusions let us summarize briey results work. expression theta dependent vacuum energy derived ref. {$9802067$} string theory calculation obtained large n pure ym theory. energy dened vacuum uctuations topological charge. eld-theoretic approach allows one clarify puzzle theta dependent vacuum energy order 1 large n limit. eld saturates expression energy specic properties, produces background energy density propagate dynamical degrees freedom large n limit. within eld theory framework subleading corrections large n result (1) calculated (see eq.
