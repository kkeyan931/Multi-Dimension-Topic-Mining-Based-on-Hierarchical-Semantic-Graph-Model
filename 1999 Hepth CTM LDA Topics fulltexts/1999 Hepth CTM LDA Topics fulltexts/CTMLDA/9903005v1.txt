in n = 1 super yang-mills theory in three spacetime dimensions, with a simple gauge
group g and a chern-simons interaction of level k, the supersymmetric index tr (1)f
can be computed by making a relation to a pure chern-simons theory or microscopically

by an explicit born-oppenheimer calculation on a two-torus. the result shows that super-
symmetry is unbroken if |k|  h/2 (with h the dual coxeter number of g) and suggests
that dynamical supersymmetry breaking occurs for |k| < h/2. the theories with large |k|
are massive gauge theories whose universality class is not fully described by the standard

criteria.

1. introduction

if a d + 1-dimensional supersymmetric quantum eld theory is quantized on td 
r (with td understood as space and r parametrizing the time), the spectrum is often
discrete. if so, one can dene a supersymmetric index tr (1)f , the number of zero energy
states that are bosonic minus the number that are fermionic. the index is invariant under
smooth variations of parameters (such as masses, couplings, and the at metric on td) that

can be varied while preserving supersymmetry. for this reason, it often can be computed

even in strongly coupled theories [1].

when tr (1)f is nonzero, there are supersymmetric states for any volume of td, and
hence the ground state energy is zero regardless of the volume. when one has a reasonable

control on the behavior of the theory for large eld strengths (to avoid for example the

possibility that a supersymmetric state goes o to innity as the volume goes to innity), it

follows that the ground state energy is zero and supersymmetry is unbroken in the innite
volume limit. conversely, if tr (1)f = 0, this gives a hint that supersymmetry might be
spontaneously broken in the quantum theory, even if it appears to be unbroken classically.

there are interesting examples of theories (e.g., nonlinear sigma models in two dimen-

sions, and pure n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory in four dimensions) in which a
nonzero value of tr (1)f has been used to show that supersymmetry remains unbroken
even for strong coupling. but there are in practice very few instances in which vanishing

of this index has served as a clue to spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. one reason

for this is that many interesting supersymmetric theories have a continuous spectrum if
compactied on a torus, making tr (1)f dicult to dene, or have a nonzero value of
tr (1)f , so that supersymmetry cannot be broken. in other examples, tr (1)f is de-
ned and equals zero, but does not give a useful hint of supersymmetry breaking because

this phenomenon is either obvious classically or is obstructed by the existence, classically,

of a mass gap, or for other reasons.

the present paper is devoted to a case in which the index does seem to give a clue

about when supersymmetry is dynamically broken. this example is the pure n = 1

supersymmetric gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions, with simple compact gauge

group g. the theory can be described in terms of a gauge eld a and a gluino eld  (a

majorana fermion in the adjoint representation). we include a chern-simons interaction,

so the lagrangian with euclidean signature reads

l =

4e2z d3xtr(cid:0)fij f ij + i  d(cid:1)

the parameter k is quantized topologically [2]. if h denotes the dual coxeter number of
g, then the quantization condition is actually that k  h/2 should be an integer, as was
pointed out in [3], using a mechanism of [4,5]. the situation will be reviewed in section

2.

let i(k) denote the supersymmetric index as a function of k. we will show that
i(k) 6= 0 for |k|  h/2, but i(k) = 0 for |k| < h/2. for example, for g = su (n), we have
h = n, and

i(k) =

1

(n  1)!

n/21yj=n/2+1

(k  j).

(1.2)

so i(k) vanishes precisely if |k| < n/2 = h/2.

from this it follows that supersymmetry is unbroken quantum mechanically for |k| 
h/2. but we conjecture that in the gap, |k| < h/2, supersymmetry is spontaneously
broken. for this we oer two bits of evidence beyond the vanishing of the index. one is

that an attempt to disprove the hypothesis of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking for
|k| < h/2 by considering an su (n)/zn theory (instead of su (n)) fails in a subtle and
interesting way. the second is that, as we will see, if the theory is formulated on a two-

torus of nite volume, spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry occurs. of course, these

considerations do not add up to a proof, but they are rather suggestive.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we compute the index for suciently

large k by using low energy eective eld theory and the relation [6] of chern-simons

gauge theory to two-dimensional conformal eld theory. in the process, we also review the

anomaly that sometimes shifts k to half-integer values, and we explain the failure of a plau-

sible attempt to disprove the hypothesis of symmetry breaking in the gap via su (n)/zn

gauge theory. in section 3, we make a more precise microscopic computation of the index,

and show that for nite volume symmetry breaking does occur in the gap. finally, in

section 4, we consider three-dimensional chern-simons theories in the light of the familiar

classication [7] of massive phases of gauge theories, and show that such massive phases

are not fully classied by the usual criteria. this is true even in four dimensions, but the

full classication of massive phases is particularly rich in three dimensions.

for other recent results on dynamics of supersymmetric chern-simons theories in

three dimensions, see [8].

2. computation via low energy eective field theory

the index can be computed very quickly if k is suciently large. at the classical
level, the theory has a mass gap for k 6= 0 [2]. the mass is of order e2|k|, which if
|k| >> 1 is much greater than the scale e2 set by the gauge couplings. so for |k| >> 1, the
classical computation is reliable, the theory has a mass gap, and in particular (as there is

no goldstone fermion) supersymmetry is unbroken.

moreover, we can compute the index for suciently large |k| using low energy eective
eld theory. for large enough |k|, the mass gap implies that the fermions can be integrated
out to give a low energy eective action that is still local. integrating out the fermions

gives a shift in the eective value of k. the shift can be computed exactly at the one-loop
level.1 in fact, integrating out the fermions shifts the eective value of k in the low energy

eective eld theory to

k = k 

h
2

sgn(k),

(2.1)

where sgn(k) is the sign of k [3]. (the shift in k is proportional to the sign of k, because

this sign determines the sign of the fermion mass term.) so for example if k is positive,
as we assume until further notice, then k = k  h/2. for the low energy theory to make
sense, k must be an integer, and hence k must be congruent to h/2 modulo z. so if h is

odd, then k is half-integral, rather than integral [3]. for example, for su (n), h = n and k

is half-integral if n is odd.

since the factor of h/2 will be important in this paper, we pause to comment on how

it emerges from feynman diagrams. the basic parity anomaly [4,5] is the assertion that

for an su (2) gauge theory with majorana fermions consisting of two copies of the two-

dimensional representation, the one-loop shift in k is 1/2. (we must take two copies of the

2 of su (2), not one, because the 2 is a pseudoreal representation, but majorana fermions

are real.) for any other representation, the one-loop shift is scaled up in proportion to

the trace of the quadratic casimir for that representation. for three majorana fermions

in the adjoint representation of su (2), the trace of the quadratic casimir is twice as big

as for two 2s, so the shift in k is 1, which we write as h/2, with h = 2 for su (2). the

result h/2 is universal, since h is the group theory factor in the one-loop diagram for any

1 there are many ways to prove this. for example, the s-loop eective action for s > 1 is
the integral of a gauge-invariant local density, which the chern-simons functional is not, so a

renormalization of the eective value of k can only come at one loop. alternatively, an s-loop
diagram is proportional to e2s2, and so can only renormalize an integer k if s = 1.

group. this argument does not explain the minus sign in the formula k = k  h/2, which
depends on some care with orientations. this sign can be seen in feynman diagrams [3],

and also has a topological meaning that we will see in section 3.

now, for very large k, though the theory has a mass gap, it is not completely trivial at

low energies. rather, there is a nontrivial dynamics of zero energy states governed by the
chern-simons theory at level k. at low energies, we can ignore the maxwell-yang-mills

term in the action, and approximate the theory by a pure chern-simons theory, with the

chern-simons action only. this is a topological eld theory and in fact is a particularly
interesting one. in general, if the pure chern-simons theory at level k is formulated on a

riemann surface  of genus g, then [6] the number of zero energy states equals the number
of conformal blocks of the wzw model of g at level k. moreover, these states are all
bosonic.2 for our present application,  = t2 and the genus is 1. in this case, the number
j(k) of conformal blocks is equal to the number of representations of the ane lie algebra

bg at level k. this number is positive for all k  0, and for large k is of order (k)r, with

r the rank of g. for more detail on the canonical

quantization of the chern-simons

theory, see [9-11].

the following paragraph is aimed to avoid a possible confusion.

in chern-simons
theory at level k, many physical results, like expectation values of products of wilson
loops, are conveniently written as functions of k + h. from the point of view of feynman

diagram calculations, this arises because a one-loop diagram with internal gauge bosons
shifts k to k + h [12,13].
in a hamiltonian approach to chern-simons gauge theory
without fermions, one sees in another way that if the parameter in the lagrangian is k,
many physical answers are functions of k + h [9,10]. (this hamiltonian approach is much

closer to what we will do in section 3 for the theory with fermions.) in asserting that the
eective coecient of the chern-simons interaction is k = k  h/2, we are referring to an
eective lagrangian in which the fermions have been integrated out, but one has not yet

tried to solve for the quantum dynamics of the gauge bosons.

since the pure chern-simons theory is a good low energy description for suciently

large k, the index of the supersymmetric theory at level k can be identied for suciently

large k with the number of supersymmetric states of the pure chern-simons theory at level
k:

i(k) = j(k).

(2.2)

2 or they are all fermionic. in nite volume, there is a potentially arbitrary sign choice in the

denition of the operator (1)f , as we will see in more detail in section 3.

4

for example, suppose g = su (2). the representations of the su (2) ane algebra at
level k have highest weights of spin 0, 1/2, 1, . . . , k/2; there are k + 1 such representations
in all. as k + 1 = k for su (2), we get

i(k) = k,

(2.3)

at least for suciently big k where the eective description by su (2) chern-simons theory
at level k is valid.

the formula, however, has a natural analytic continuation for all k, and we may

wonder if (2.3) holds for all k. we will show this in the next section by a microscopic

computation, but in the meantime, a hint that this is so is as follows. the sign reversal
k  k is equivalent in the chern-simons theory to a reversal of spacetime orientation,
so one might expect i(k) = i(k). actually, in general, the sign of the operator (1)f
if a
in nite volume can depend on an arbitrary choice, as in some examples in [1].

parity-invariant choice of this sign cannot be made in general, then we should expect only
i(k) = i(k). this is consistent with (2.3), which gives i(k) = i(k). we will see in
section 3 that the general formula, for a gauge group g of rank r, is

i(k) = (1)ri(k).

(2.4)

in (2.3), we can also see the claim made in the introduction: i(k) = 0 for |k| < h/2,
and i(k) 6= 0 for |k|  h/2. for su (2), as h/2 = 1, this is equivalent to the statement
that i(k) vanishes precisely if k = 0. we thus learn that for g = su (2), supersymmetry
is unbroken for all k 6= 0, and we conjecture that it is spontaneously broken for k = 0.
(if this is so, then in particular there is a goldstone fermion for k = 0, and the pure

chern-simons theory on which we have based our initial derivation of (2.3) is not a good

low energy description for k = 0.)

a similar structure holds for other groups. for example, for g = su (n) one has

j(k) =

1

(n  1)!

n1yj=1

(k + j).

(2.5)

(one way to compute this formula  and its generalization to other groups  will be

reviewed in section 3.) when expressed in terms of k, this gives the formula for i(k)

already presented in the introduction:

i(k) =

1

(n  1)!

n/21yj=n/2+1

(k  j).

(2.6)

we see the characteristic properties i(k) = (1)n1i(k) and i(k) = 0 for |k| < n/2.

2.1. microscopic derivation of parity anomaly

the shift in the eective value of k  namely k = k  1

2 h sgn(k)  has played an
important role in this discussion. as we have already noted, the existence of this shift

implies  since the eective chern-simons coupling must be an integer  that k is congruent

modulo z to h/2. when h is odd  for example, for su (n) with odd n  it follows that k is

not an integer and in particular cannot be zero. such a phenomenon in three-dimensional

gauge theories is known as a parity anomaly [4,5], the idea being that the theory conserves

parity if and only if k vanishes, so the non-integrality of k means that parity cannot be

conserved.

the derivation of the parity anomaly from the shift in the eective value of k is

valid for suciently large k  where there is an eective low energy description as a chern-

simons theory  but is not valid for small k. one would like to complement this low energy

explanation by an explanation at short distances, in terms of the elementary degrees of

freedom, that does not depend on knowledge about the dynamics at long distances.

we will now review how this is done [4,5]. in this discussion, we assume to begin with

that the gauge group g is simply-connected (and connected), so that the gauge bundle

over the three-dimensional spacetime manifold x is automatically trivial. for most of

the discussion below, the topology of x does not matter, but for eventual computation of
tr (1)f , one is most interested in t3 or t2  r.

the path integral in a three-dimensional gauge theory with fermions has two factors

the denition of whose phases requires care. one is the exponential of the chern-simons

functional. the other is the fermion path integral. as the fermions are real, the fermion
path integral equals the square root of the determinant of the dirac operator d = i  d.
(when we want to make explicit the dependence of the dirac operator on a gauge eld
a, we write it as da. note that we consider the massless dirac operator. the topological
considerations of interest for the moment are independent of the mass.) thus, the factors

that we must look at are

det d exp(cid:18) ik

4z tr(cid:18)a  da +

2
3

a  a  a(cid:19)(cid:19) .

(2.7)

first let us recall the issues in dening det d. the operator d is hermitian, so its

eigenvalues are real. moreover, in three dimensions, for fermions taking values in a real

bundle such as the adjoint bundle, the eigenvalues are all of even multiplicity. this follows

6

from the existence of an antiunitary symmetry analogous to cpt in four dimensions. 3

the determinant of the dirac operator is dened roughly as

det d =yi

i,

(2.8)

where the innite product is regularized with (for example) zeta function or pauli-villars

regularization. note in particular that the determinant is formally positive  there are

innitely many negative s, but they come in pairs  and this positivity is preserved in

the regularization. now consider the square root of the determinant, which is dened

roughly as

det d =yi

i,

(2.9)

where the product runs over all pairs of eigenvalues and the symbolqi
the square root of the determinant) we take one eigenvalue from each degenerate pair. this
innite product of course needs regularization. since det d has already been dened, to
make sense of det d we must only dene the sign. for this we must determine, formally,

 means that (to get

whether the number of negative eigenvalue pairs is even or odd; it is here that an anomaly

will come in.

it suces to determine the sign of det da up to an overall a-independent sign

(which cancels out when we compute correlation functions). for this, we x an arbitrary
connection a0 (chosen generically so that the dirac operator da0 has no zero eigenvalues),

and declare thatpdet da0 is, say, positive. then to determine the sign of det da for any
other connection a on the same bundle, we interpolate from a0 to a via a one-parameter
family of connections at, with at=0 = a0, and at=1 = a.4 we follow the spectrum of dat
as t evolves from 0 to 1, and denote the net number of eigenvalue pairs that change sign

from positive to negative as the spectral ow q. (if at is a generic one-parameter family,
then there are no level crossings for 0  t  1, and the spectral ow for 0  t  1 is as
follows: every eigenvalue pair ows upwards or downwards by |q| units.) then we dene
3 use standard gamma matrix conventions such that, in a local lorentz frame, the gamma
matrices are the 2  2 pauli spin matrices, which are real and symmetric or imaginary and
antisymmetric. the dirac operator then commutes with the antiunitary transformation t :  
. since t is antiunitary and t 2 = 1,  and t  are always linearly independent, so the
eigenstates of the dirac operator come in pairs.

4 for example, we can take the family at = ta0 + (1  t)a.

7

the sign of det da to be (1)q, the intuitive idea being that the sign of the product in

(2.9) should change whenever an eigenvalue pair crosses zero. the only potential problem

with this denition is that it might depend on the path from a0 to a.

a problem arises precisely if there is a path dependence in the value of q modulo

2. there is such path dependence if and only if there is a closed path, in the space

of connections modulo gauge transformations, for which the spectral ow is odd. to
determine whether this occurs, we proceed as follows. let at, for 0  t  1, be a family
of gauge elds such that a1 is gauge-equivalent to a0 by a gauge transformation . such
an  is classied by its winding number  which takes values in 3(g) = z.5 in this
situation, there is a nice formula for the spectral ow. each at is a connection on a trivial
bundle over x. the family at, 0  t  1, can be t together to make a connection on a
trivial bundle over i  x, where i = [0, 1] is the closed unit interval. gluing together the
endpoints of i to make a circle s1  and identifying the gauge bundles over the boundaries
of i  x using the gauge transformation   one can reinterpret the family at as a
connection on a possibly nontrivial bundle e over s1  x. this bundle has instanton
number , determined by the topological twist of . the spectral ow is then

q = h.

(2.10)

this relation between spectral ow and the topology of the bundle [14], which is important

in instanton physics [15], is proved roughly as follows using the index theorem for the four-
dimensional dirac operator on s1  x. we call that operator d4 and let d4,+ and d4,
be the restrictions of d4 to spinors of positive or negative chirality, namely

d4, = 


t

+ dat ,

(2.11)

where  is a positive real number that one can introduce by scaling the metric on x.
for small , the dirac equation d4, = 0 can be studied in terms of the t-dependent
spectrum of dat. if i(t) are the eigenstates of dat with eigenvalues si(t), then one can
approximately solve the four-dimensional dirac equation with the formula

i(t) =xkz

exp z t+k

0

si(t)dt! i(t + k)

(2.12)

5 the winding number completely species the topology of  because we are taking g to be
connected and simply-connected. otherwise, depending on the topology of spacetime,  may

have additional topological invariants.

8

where the sign in the exponent is  to give zero modes of d4,. the sum over k has
been included to ensure i(t + 1) = i(t). dierent i that are related by spectral ow
(that is by t  t + 1) give the same i, so for generic spectral ow there are |2q| linearly
independent four-dimensional solutions of this kind. for i to be square integrable, the
exponential factor in (2.12) must vanish for t  , so si(t) must be negative for
t   and also for t  . this determines that the chirality of the solutions is the
same as the sign of the spectral ow q. the upshot is that the index i(d4) of d4 equals
2q. (the factor of 2 arises because we dened q by counting pairs of eigenvalues; each pair

now we put our results together. under the gauge transformation , or in other

contributes two four-dimensional zero modes.) on the other hand, the index theorem for
the dirac operator gives i(d4) = 2h. combining the formulas for i(d4) gives (2.10).
words in interpolating from t = 0 to t = 1, the sign of det d changes by (1)q.
in
view of (2.10), this factor is (1)h. on the other hand, the change in the chern-simons
functional under a gauge transformation of winding number  is 2. so under the gauge

transformation , the dangerous factors (2.7) in the path integral pick up a factor

(1)h exp(2ik).

(2.13)

gauge invariance of the theory amounts to the statement that this factor must be an

integer for arbitrary integer , and this gives us the restriction on k:

k =

h
2

modulo z.

(2.14)

2.2. the su (n)/zn theory

now we have assembled the ingredients to put the hypothesis of dynamical supersym-
metry breaking for |k| < h/2 to an apparently rather severe test. the discussion is most
interesting for the case g = su (n), so we focus on that case.

the idea is to consider tr (1)f for an su (n)/zn theory on t2. the key dierence
between su (n) and su (n)/zn is that any su (n) bundle on t2 is trivial, but an su (n)/zn
bundle on t2 is characterized by a discrete magnetic ux w that takes values in zn. (for
n = 2, su (2)/z2 = so(3), and the discrete ux is the second stieel-whitney class of
the bundle.) an example of a bundle with any required value of w is as follows. consider
a at su (n)/zn bundle whose holonomies u and v around the two directions in t2, if
lifted to su (n), obey

u v = v u exp(2ir/n).

(2.15)

9

such a at bundle has w = r.

the computation of tr (1)f for this theory can be made very easily in case r and
n are relatively prime, for instance r = 1. (the computation can be done for any r by

using the relation to the wzw model of su (n)/zn, along the lines of section 2.1 above,

or more explicitly using the techniques of section 3.) the idea is simply [1] that zero

energy quantum states are obtained, for weak coupling, by quantizing the space of zero

energy classical states (including possible bosonic or fermionic zero modes). a zero energy

classical conguration of the gauge elds is a at connection. for r and n relatively prime,

a at connection  that is a pair of matrices u and v obeying (2.15)  is unique up to

gauge transformation. moreover, in expanding around such a at connection, there are no

bosonic or fermionic zero modes. hence, the quantization is straightforward: quantizing a

unique, isolated classical state of zero energy, with no zero modes, gives a unique quantum
state.6 the index is therefore 1 (with the sign possibly depending on a choice of sign in
the denition of the operator (1)f ).

note that k plays no role in this argument. hence, for any k for which the su (n)/zn
theory exists, this theory, if formulated on a bundle with r prime to n, has a supersym-
metric vacuum state for any volume of t2. taking the limit of innite volume, it follows

that the su (n)/zn theory, for any such k, has zero vacuum energy and hence unbroken
supersymmetry.

but in innite volume, the su (n) and su (n)/zn theories are equivalent.7 hence
for any k for which the su (n)/zn theory is dened, the su (n) theory has unbroken
supersymmetry.

does this not disprove the hypothesis that the su (n) theory has spontaneously broken
supersymmetry in the gap, that is for |k| < n/2? in fact, there is an elegant escape which
we will now describe.

the allowed values of k were determined for su (n) by requiring that

(1)n exp(2ik)

(2.16)

6 there is actually a potential subtlety in this statement, though it is inessential in the examples
under discussion. one must verify that the one state in question obeys gausss law, in other words

that it is invariant under the gauge symmetries left unbroken by the classical solution that is being

quantized.

7 except for questions of which operators one chooses to probe them by; such questions are

irrelevant for the present purposes.

10

should equal 1 for all integer values of the instanton number . (we have rewritten (2.13)

using the fact that h = n for su (n).) for su (n)/zn, there is a crucial dierence: the
instanton number  is not necessarily an integer, but takes values in z/n [16].
(for
example, setting x = t3, an su (n)/zn bundle on s1  t3 = t4 that has unit magnetic
ux in the 1-2 and 3-4 directions and other components vanishing has instanton number

1/n modulo z. in fact, on a four-manifold that is not spin, the instanton number takes

values in z/2n, but for our present purpose  as the supersymmetric theory has fermions

 only spin manifolds are relevant.) hence gauge invariance of the theory requires that
(2.16) should equal 1 not just for all   z, but for all   z/n. this gives the relation

k =

n
2

modulo n.

(2.17)

thus, for su (n)/zn, k cannot be in the gap |k| < n/2, and the behavior of the su (n)/zn
theory in nite volume cannot be used to exclude the hypothesis that in the gap supersym-

metry is dynamically broken. though this does not prove that supersymmetry is broken

in the gap for su (n), the elegant escape does suggest that that is the right interpretation.

3. microscopic computation of the index

in this section, we will make a microscopic computation of tr (1)f in the n = 1
supersymmetric pure gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions. we consider rst the

case that the gauge group g is simply connected.

we thus formulate the theory on a spatial torus t2 (times time) and look for zero

energy states. as in [1], the computation will be done by a born-oppenheimer approxi-

mation, quantizing the space of classical zero energy states, and is valid for weak coupling
or small volume of t2. to be more exact, we work on a torus of radius r, and let e and

k denote, as before, the gauge and chern-simons couplings. particles with momentum on
t2 have energies of order 1/r, while the fermion and gauge boson bare mass is e2k. we

work in the region

e2k <<

1
r

.

(3.1)

we will write an eective hamiltonian that describes states with energies of order e2k (or

less) but omits states with energies of order 1/r.

a zero energy classical gauge eld conguration is a at connection and is determined
up to gauge transformation by its holonomies u, v around the two directions in t2. these

11

holonomies, since they commute, can simultaneously be conjugated to the maximal torus
u of g,8 in a way that is unique up to a weyl transformation. the moduli space m
of at g-connections on t2 is thus a copy of (u  u)/w , where w is the weyl group.
concretely, a at connection on t2 can be represented by a constant gauge eld

ai =

ca
i t a,

rxa=1

(3.2)

where the t a, a = 1, . . . , r are a basis of the lie algebra of u and the ca
i can be regarded as
constant abelian gauge elds on t2. the at metric on t2 determines a complex structure

to construct the right quantum mechanics on m, we must also look at the fermion
zero modes. actually, by zero modes we mean modes whose energy is at most of order
e2k, rather than 1/r. in nding these modes, we can ignore the fermion bare mass and
look for zero modes of the massless two-dimensional dirac operator d. we then will write
an eective lagrangian that incorporates the eects of the fermion bare mass. let +
and  be the gluino elds of positive and negative chirality on t2. (they are hermitian
conjugates of each other.) for a diagonal at connection such as we have assumed, the
equation d = 0 has a very simple structure. for generic u and v (or equivalently for
generic ca
i ), the o-diagonal fermions have no zero modes, while the diagonal fermions
have constant zero modes. in other words, the zero modes of  are given by the ansatz

 being anticommuting constants.

now let us discuss quantization of the fermions. quantization of the nonzero modes

gives a fock space. quantization of the zero modes a

 is, as usual, more subtle. the

canonical anticommutation relations of the s are, with an appropriate normalization,

+, b

{a

} = ab, {+, +} = {, } = 0.

(3.4)

thus, we can regard the + and  as creation and annihilation operators. for example,
we can introduce a state |i annihilated by the a

(3.5)

now let us try to dene the operator (1)f .

it is clear how we want (1)f to

act on the fock space built by quantizing the nonzero modes of the fermions:

the ground state invariant and anticommutes with all nonzero modes of . the only

subtlety is in the action on the zero mode hilbert space. there is in general no natural
choice for the sign of (1)f . if we pick, say (1)f|i = +|i, then (3.5) implies that
(1)f|+i = (1)r|+i. thus, if r is even, we can fairly naturally pick both of the states
|i to be bosonic. but if r is odd, then inevitably one is bosonic and one is fermionic;
which is which depends on a completely arbitrary choice. now we can explain an assertion

in section 2, namely that

i(k) = (1)ri(k).

(3.6)

changing the sign of the chern-simons level is equivalent to a transformation that reverses
the orientation of t2. such a transformation exchanges + with , and so exchanges
|+i with |i. this exchange reverses the sign of the (1)f operator if r is odd, and
that leads to (3.6).

the hilbert space made by quantizing the fermion zero modes has a very natural
interpretation. the quadratic form (3.4) has the same structure as the metric ds2 =
z of m, so the s can be interpreted as gamma matrices on m. hence
the hilbert space obtained by quantizing the zero modes is the space of spinor elds on
m, with values in a line bundle w that we have not yet identied. (such a line bundle
may appear because, for example, for a given point on m, the state |+i is unique up to
a complex multiple, but as one moves on m, it varies as the ber of a not-yet-determined
complex line bundle.)

because m is a complex manifold, spinor elds on m have a particularly simple
description. let k be the canonical line bundle of m, and assume for the time being that
there exists on m a line bundle k 1/2. then the space of spinors on m is the same as the
space 0,q(m )  k 1/2 of (0, q)-forms on m (for 0  q  s) with values in k 1/2. in this
identication, we regard |+i as a (0, 0)-form on m (with values in a line bundle), and we
identify a general state in the fermionic space

the object d/daa

have periods that are integer multiples of 2 gives a condition that is equivalent to the

quantization [2] of the chern-simons coupling (see [9-11] for more on such matters), so if
we set k = 1 the line bundle that we get is the most basic line bundle l over the phase
space, in the sense that it has positive curvature and all other line bundles over the phase
space are of the form ln for some integer n. the factor of k in (3.12) means that the line
bundle w over the phase space m is w = lk. so the states are spinors with values in lk,
or equivalently (0, q)-forms with values in lk  k 1/2.

evaluating this expression in the space of zero modes, the s become gamma matrices

the supercharges q and q+ reduce to e times the  and

because there is a magnetic eld on m proportional to k (with connection form on

contains a term e2ka
+ab. this coupling is the bare mass term, written in the space of

9 the factor of e arises because the  kinetic energy in the original lagrangian was d/e2,
so /e is a canonically normalized fermion. as the supercharges are properly normalized as e



and e

, the hamiltonian is h = e2{, 



}.

3.1. calculations

now we will perform calculations of tr (1)f . first we consider the case that g =

su (n).

for su (n), the moduli space m is a copy of cpn1. 10 the basic line bundle over
m is l = o(1), the bundle whose sections are functions of degree one in the homogeneous
coordinates of cpn1. the canonical bundle of cpn1 is k = ln.

the quantum hilbert space found in the above born-oppenheimber approximation
is the space of spinors with values in w = lk, or equivalently (0, q)-forms with values in
w  k 1/2 = lkn/2. since only integral powers of l are well-dened as line bundles over
m, we get the restriction

k =

n
2

modulo z.

(3.15)

this is the restriction found in [3] and reviewed in section 2; we have now given a hamil-

tonian explanation of it.

since the supersymmetry generators are the  and 



operators, the space of super-

symmetric states, in this approximation, is

i=0h i(cpn1, lkn/2).
n

the supersymmetric index is

i(k) =

nxi=0

(1)idim h i(cpn1, lkn/2).

(3.16)

(3.17)

this can be computed by a riemann-roch formula, which implies in particular that i(k)

is a polynomial in k of order n.

however, for a more precise description  and in particular to see supersymmetry
breaking in the gap, |k| < n/2  we wish to compute the individual cohomology groups,
and not just the index. for this computation, see for example [19]. for n < t < 0, one
has h i(cpn1, lt) = 0 for all i. hence, for

n
2



< k <

n
2

,

(3.18)

10 for example, for n = 2, the maximal torus u is a circle and the weyl group is w = z2,
so m = (u  u)/w = t2/z2, which is an orbifold version of s2 = cp1. for general n, the
standard proof that m = cpn1 can be found, for example, in section 2.1 of [18].

16

there are no zero energy states at all in the present approximation. thus, for this range

of k, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken if the theory is formulated on a two-torus

with suciently weak coupling that our analysis is a good approximation. (because the

ground state energy in nite volume is a real analytic function of the volume, it also follows
that supersymmetry is unbroken for any generic volume on t2.) this hints but certainly

does not prove that also for innite volume, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken if
|k| < n/2.

for t  0, h i(cpn1, lt) = 0 for i > 0, and h 0(cpn1, lt) is the space of homoge-
neous polynomials of degree t in the n homogeneous coordinates of cpn1. the dimension
of this space is n(n + 1) . . . (n + t  1)/t! = (n + t  1)!/t!(n  1)! setting t = k  n/2 and
interpreting this dimension as the supersymmetric index i(k), we get the formula for i(k)

that was stated in the introduction:

i(k) =

1

(n  1)!

n/21yj=n/2+1

(k  j).

(3.19)

finally, serre duality determines what happens for t  n in terms of the results
for t  0. in particular, for t  n, the cohomology h i(cpn1, lt) vanishes except for
i = n  1, and is dual to h 0(cpn1, lnt). from this, we get a formula for i(k) with
k  n/2 which coincides with (3.19). note that for k  n/2, all supersymmetric states
are bosonic, and for k  n/2, all supersymmetric states have statistics (1)n1. serre
duality gives directly i(k) = (1)n1i(k).

generalization to other groups

we will now more briey summarize the generalization for an arbitrary simple, con-

nected and simply-connected gauge group g of rank r.

first of all, the moduli space m is a weighted projective space wcpr

s0,s1,...,sr , where
the weights si are 1 and the coecients of the highest coroot of g. this is a theorem of
looijenga; for an alternative proof see [18]. in particular, the weights obeypr
i=0 si = h.
the basic line bundle over m is l = o(1), characterized by the fact that sections of lt
for any t are functions of weighted degree t in the homogeneous coordinates of m. the
canonical bundle of m is k = lh. so, in the born-oppenheimer approximation, the
low-lying states are spinors valued in lkh/2. integrality of the exponent gives again the
result that k  h/2 must be integral.

17

the space of supersymmetric states is, again,

r
i=0h i(m, lkh/2).

(3.20)

a weighted projective space has certain properties in common with an ordinary projective
space. one of these is that h i(m, lt) = 0 for all i if h < t < 0. this implies (in nite vol-
ume) supersymmetry breaking in the gap, |k| < h/2. for t  0, the cohomology groups
vanish except in dimension 0, and h 0(m, lt) is the space of polynomials homogeneous
and of weighted degree t in the homogeneous coordinates of m. in particular, i(k) > 0 for
k  h/2, and supersymmetry is unbroken. serre duality asserts that h i(m, lt) is dual to
h ri(m, lht), and relates the region k  h/2 to k  h/2. in particular, for k  h/2,
the only nonzero cohomology group is in dimension r, the states have statistics (1)r, and
the index is determined by i(k) = (1)ri(k) and so is in particular nonzero.

3.2. orbifolds and anyons

here, we make a few miscellaneous comments on the problem.
the moduli space m is an orbifold m = (u  u)/w , a quotient of a at manifold
by a nite group. however, we have not used this fact in computing the index. the
reason is that although the moduli space m is an orbifold, the quantum mechanics on m
is not orbifold quantum mechanics, that is, it is not obtained from supersymmetric free
particle motion on u  u by imposing w -invariance. rather, the quantum mechanics on
m depends on the line bundle lk.

one can ask whether there are values of k at which the quantum mechanics on m
reduces to orbifold quantum mechanics. we will approach this as follows. we begin
with a system consisting of (0, q)-forms on u  u with the hamiltonian being simply the
laplacian (relative to the at metric on u u). in orbifold quantum mechanics, we want
w -invariant states of zero energy.

a zero energy state must have a wave function that is invariant under translations on
u u. this means that the bosonic part of the wave-function, being a constant function,
is w -invariant. hence, w -invariance must be imposed on the fermionic part of the wave

function, which as we recall takes values in a fermionic fock space with basis obtained by
acting with creation operators on a vacuum |i or |+i.

the states |i and |+i transform as one-dimensional representations of w , since
s) is weyl-invariant.

the condition that a state be annihilated by all a

+s (or by all a

18

the group w has two one-dimensional representations: the trivial representation; and a
representation r in which each elementary reection acts by 1. since

|+i =

rya=1

a
+|i,

(3.21)

and the product qr

+ is odd under every elementary reection, the two states |i
and |+i transform oppositely: one transforms in the trivial representation of w , and the
other transforms as r.

a=1 a

suppose that we take the w action such that |i transforms trivially. then |i
itself (times a constant function on u u) is a w -invariant state of zero energy, and is in
fact the only one. to prove the uniqueness, one can use the fact that the w action on the
fermion fock space is the same as that on the (0, q)-forms on u u. the w -invariant and
translation-invariant states on u  u can therefore be identied with the  cohomology
group h i((u u)/w, o), where o is a trivial holomorphic line bundle. this cohomology
is one-dimensional for i = 0 and vanishes for i > 0, since (u  u)/w = cpn1.

now let us compare this orbifold quantum mechanics to the born-oppenheimer quan-

tization of the gauge theory. in the latter, at general level k, we identied the supersym-
metric states with elements of h i(m, lkh/2), where m = (u u)/w . this agrees with
the orbifold answer h i(m, o) if and only if k = h/2, so that must be the correct value of
k corresponding to orbifold quantum mechanics with |i assumed to be weyl-invariant.
the other possibility, that |+i is weyl-invariant, is obtained by reversal of orientation,
which is equivalent to k  k; so this other orbifold quantum mechanics should correspond
to k = h/2.

these arguments strongly suggest that the low energy quantum mechanics is just

orbifold quantum mechanics for these special values of k. as we discuss below and in

section 4, these are apparently the values for which the theory is conning.

anyons

it is perhaps surprising that the simple orbifold cases correspond not to the obvious
case k = 0 but to k = h/2. let us see instead consider what happens for k = 0. for
simplicity, we take g = su (2), so that u is a circle and w = z2.

even though m = (u  u)/z2 is an orbifold, the quantum mechanics is, as we have
seen, not orbifold quantum mechanics for k = 0. to measure the failure, let us see what
happens near the orbifold singularities of (u  u)/z2. for example, we can consider the

19

singularity associated with the trivial at connection, where the ci introduced in (3.2)

all vanish. (for su (2), the index a takes only one value, so we write the ca
i just as ci.)
the weyl group acts as ci  ci, and there is a singularity at ci = 0. how can we
best understand this singularity? near ci = 0, it is more illuminating to consider not

compactication from 2 + 1 dimensions to 0 + 1  as we have done so far  but dimensional

reduction to 0 + 1 dimensions, in which one starts with 2 + 1-dimensional super yang-

mills thoery and by at one requires the elds to be invariant under spatial translations.

dimensional reduction and compactication dier in that the compactied theory also has

modes of non-zero momentum along t2, and has periodic identications of the ci under
ci  ci + 2. these are irrelevant for studying the singularity near ci = 0.

in the dimensionally reduced theory, there is a u (1) symmetry under rotations of the
c1  c2 plane. (the compactied theory only has a discrete subgroup of this symmetry;
that is one of the main reasons to consider the dimensionally reduced theory in the present

discussion.) we will call the generator of this u (1) the angular momentum. the fermion
fock space has, for su (2), only the two states |i and |+i (as there is only one creation
operator and one annihilation operator). since a fermion creation operator, of spin 1/2,
maps one to the other, their angular momenta are j and j  1/2 for some j. but the
dimensionally reduced theory has also a parity symmetry exchanging these two states and

reversing the sign of the angular momentum. hence j = 1/4, and the two states have
angular momenta 1/4, 1/4. this contrasts with orbifold quantum mechanics on r2/z2,
where the spins are half-integral. thus a precise measure of the dierence of the k = 0

system from an orbifold is that the k = 0 system generates anyons, states whose angular

momentum does not take values in z/2.

such anyons may arise in the compactication of type iib superstring theory to

three dimensions on a seven-manifold x of g2 holonomy. consider a system of m parallel

sevenbranes wrapped on x. this system is governed by 2 + 1-dimensional u (m) super

yang-mills theory with two supercharges, dimensionally reduced to 0 + 1 dimensions. this
suggests that the wrapped sevenbranes may be anyons of spins 1/4, but to be certain,
one would need to look closely at the denition of angular momentum for these string

theory excitations.

20

3.3. discrete electric and magnetic flux

we will briey discuss the generalization of the computation to incorporate discrete

electric and magnetic ux.

(we will consider only the simplest versions of electric or

magnetic ux. it is of course possible to mix the two constructions.)

including magnetic ux simply means taking the gauge group g not to be simply
connected and working on a non-trivial gauge bundle e over t2. the moduli space m
of zero energy gauge congurations is now the moduli space of at connections on e. in
certain cases, mentioned in section 2.2 above, m is a single point, and the quantization
is then completely straightforward. in general, m is always a weighted projective space
(which can be constructed using the technique in [18]), and the quantum ground states
are always, as above, h i(m, lkh/2). in particular, the index is always nonvanishing for
|k|  h/2.

including electric ux means that one goes back to the case that g is simply connected.

one considers a gauge transformation u that, in going around, say, the rst circle in
t2 = s1  s1, transforms as

u  u ,

(3.22)

where  is an element of the center of g. this transformation is a symmetry t of the
theory. if, for example,  is of order s, then u s generates a gauge transformation that is
homotopic to the identity, and t s

 = 1 on all physical states. the eigenvalues of t are

thus of the form exp(2ir/s) where r is an integer called the discrete electric ux.

a simple way to determine the action of t on the space h of supersymmetric ground
states of our supersymmetric gauge theory is to use the relation of pure chern-simons
theory at level k to the wzw model, also at that level. the hilbert space of the pure
chern-simons theory in quantization on t2 has a basis that can be described as follows.
regard t2 = s1  s1 as the boundary of s1  d, where d is a two-dimensional disc.
consider the chern-simons path integral on s1  d, with an insertion of a wilson line
operator

wr(c) = trrp expzc

a.

(3.23)

here r is a representation of g, and c  s1  d is a circle of the form c = s1  p , with
p being a point in the disc d. for any given r, the path integral on s1  d with insertion
of wr(c) gives a state r in the chern-simons hilbert space on s1  s1 at level k, and
this space, as we have argued, is the same as h. as r ranges over the highest weights of

21

integrable representations of the bg ane algebra at level k, the r furnish a basis of h

[6]. (the rs for other representations are zero or a multiple of one of the rs for an
integrable representation.)

going back to the electric ux operator t, its action on the state r is now clear.
it maps wr(c) to (r)wr(c), where the central element  of g acts in the irreducible
representation r as multiplication by (r). so it likewise maps r to (r)r.

if there is a zero energy state carrying electric ux for any value of the spatial volume,

this means that the theory is not conning. connement of electric ux can therefore

occur only if the center of g acts trivially on all r, or equivalently on all integrable
representations of the wzw model at level k. this, however, is so only at k = 0 (where
only the trivial representation is integrable). for example, for su (2), at level k, the
integrable representations have highest weights 0, 1/2, 1, . . . , k/2, so whenever k > 0, there

is an integrable representation of half-integer spin, on which the center acts nontrivially.
among the theories with unbroken supersymmetry, only the theory with k = 0  and thus
k = h/2  might be interpreted as conning.

the theories with |k| < h/2 may very well also be conning, but as they conjecturally
have spontaneously broken supersymmetry, we cannot probe their dynamics by looking for

supersymmetric states.

4. classication of massive phases

this concluding section will be devoted to some remarks about the classication of

massive phases of gauge theories.11

consider a gauge theory with a mass gap. let us look at the behavior of wilson loop

operators wr(c) = trrp exprc a, with r some representation of g and c a loop in

spacetime. let l(c) be the circumference of c, and a(c) the minimal area of a surface

that it spans. the renormalization of wr(c) that we allow is local along the loop:

wr(c)  erl(c)wr(c).

(4.1)

here r is a renormalization parameter. we want to study the behavior of hwr(c)i as the
loop c is scaled up in size. in some theories (and for some representations), hwr(c)i 
11 these remarks were suggested in part by discussions ca. 1990 with m. marcu  see [20] 

and m. f. atiyah.

22

exp(ra(c)), with r a positive constant, modulo subleading terms which vary with the
circumference rather than the area. such a statement is invariant under a renormalization
of the form (4.1). if hwr(c)i behaves this way, then it vanishes in the limit that c is
scaled up no matter what renormalization is used. on the other hand, it may happen that
the area coecient r vanishes. in this case, hwr(c)i has with generic renormalization an
exponential dependence on the circumference. we can pick the renormalization constant

in (4.1) to cancel this term. what happens then?

in a theory with a mass gap, one would expect that for large loops,

lnhwr(c)i = ra(c) + rl(c) + . . . ,

(4.2)

where the . . . terms are constant in the limit of large loops. (in the absence of a mass

gap, there can be much more complicated behavior; for example, feynman diagrams in a
theory with massless elds can give terms l(c) ln l(c)m for all integers m.) if r vanishes
and we choose the renormalization to cancel r, then lnhwr(c)i should have a limit as c
becomes large. we conclude then that with our renormalization

nr(c) = lim

chwr(c)i

(4.3)

should exist in a massive gauge theory. the conning case  r > 0  is the case that

nr(c) = 0.

above three dimensions, this construction exhibits one constant for every representa-

tion. in three dimensions, the construction is much richer, because the loop c in spacetime

may be knotted. thus, in the three-dimensional case, in a massive gauge theory, we get

an invariant for every representation and every knot class. in the examples we have been
examining in the present paper, there is a mass gap for suciently large |k| (conjecturally
that this is so precisely if |k|  h/2), and the low energy theory is a chern-simons
theory at level k = k  h/2  sgn k. the large loop limits of the expectation values of the
hwr(c)i can [6] be expressed in terms of the celebrated jones polynomial of knots and its
generalizations.

at least in the three-dimensional examples, it seems fairly clear that the nr(c) must

depend only on the universality class of the theory. the eective theory at very long
distances is characterized just by the integer k  which controls the knot invariants  and

this integer cannot change under continuous variation of parameters.

23

in four-dimensional massive gauge theories, the meaning and signicance of the nr(c)
is less apparent. it seems probable, however, that they are invariants of the universality

class of a theory.

analysis of phases in three dimensions

the dependence on k makes it clear that the usual higgs/connement dichotomy
is not the whole story for classication of massive phases of gauge theories in three di-

mensions. we have, on the contrary, innitely many inequivalent universality classes,
parameterized by k; none of the theories with k > 0 is conning as they all have some
nonzero nr(c) with r a representation in which the center of the gauge group acts non-
trivially. this follows from the formulas in [6] for expectation values of wilson loops in
pure chern-simons theory. alternatively, the theories with k > 0 are not conning, since
we showed in section 3.3 that in these theories, electric ux winding on a torus has no cost

in energy.

the case that k = 0, when the low energy theory is a pure gauge theory without
chern-simons interaction, might be conning. some evidence for this appeared in section
3.3, where we saw that in this case, there is no zero energy state on t2 with electric ux.
it follows from this fact that all nr(c), with the center of g acting nontrivially on r,
vanish if k = 0. for one could factorize the evaluation of nr(c) by cutting the three-
dimensional spacetime on a two-torus s that consists of all points a distance  from c, for
some small . upon scaling c  , one can also take   , and the path integral on
the solid torus bounded by s and containing c gives a state carrying electric ux in the

hilbert space obtained by quantizing the pure chern-simons theory on c. as the pure

chern-simons theory has no physical states on s that have electric ux, the path integral
for hwr(c)i will vanish for c  .

the above reasoning used a possibly risky analytic continuation of the chern-simons
results (which are usually considered for k > 0) to k = 0. i will now describe somewhat
more explicitly how this analytic continuation works, taking g = su (2) as an illustration.
in su (2) chern-simons theory at level k, the loop expectation value nr(c), for a non-
trivial representation r with highest weight of spin j, vanishes if j is congruent to 1/2
mod (k + 2)/2, but not otherwise for a generic c. 12 for k = 0, this means that nr(c)

12 all chern-simons observables can be expressed in terms of quantities in the wzw model
such as the matrix s that generates the modular transformation   1/ on the characters.
in a basis of representations of highest weight j, the matrix elements of s for su (2) at level

k are sjj  =p2/(k + 2) sin ((2j + 1)(2j + 1)/(k + 2)). this shows the vanishing if j or j is

congruent to 1/2 mod (k + 2)/2.

24

vanishes if j is a half-integer, and not otherwise. this is the usual statement of connement:

there is an area law precisely if the representation transforms nontrivially under the center

of the gauge group.

thus it seems likely that precisely at k = h/2, the theories studied in the present
paper have a mass gap, unbroken supersymmetry and connement. for |k| > h/2, they
are in inequivalent higgs-like phases with a mass gap and unbroken supersymmetry, and
for |k| < h/2, they conjecturally have a massless goldstone fermion (and perhaps conne-
ment).

going back to the three-dimensional examples, let us examine the other standard

criterion for connement, which is whether external magnetic ux is screened. in three
dimensions, one considers a local t hooft operator o(p ; w) dened by removing a point p
from spacetime and inserting a nontrivial magnetic ux w on a small sphere surrounding

p . (in four dimensions, one has instead an t hooft loop operator dened by removing

a loop c from spacetime and inserting magnetic ux on a sphere that links c.) in the
three-dimensional case, a restriction on k is needed in introducing the operators o(p ; w).
for instance, as we saw in section 2, if g = su (n) and w is prime to n, then the restriction

is that k should be congruent to n/2 modulo n.

t hoofts criterion for a higgs phase of a massive gauge theory in four dimensions is

that the t hooft loop should show area law in four dimensions; in three dimensions the
criterion is that the expectation value ho(p ; w)i should vanish. in our three-dimensional
examples, one might expect this criterion to be obeyed for k > h/2, as these theories are
not conning. this is so. on s2, the modulo space of at connections on a bundle with

nonzero magnetic ux is empty, and hence the chern-simons theory if quantized with such
a bundle on s2  r (with r understood as the time direction) has no physical states.
because of the topological invariance of the chern-simons theory at long distances, the
expectation value ho(p ; w)i can be computed in radial quantization  where the radius
measures the distance from p .
in other words, we consider the operator o(p ; w) to
prepare an initial state at r = 0 (r being the distance from p ), and propagate outward
to r = . this propagation should project onto zero energy states. but there are no
zero energy states to project onto, so the expectation value vanishes. or more prosaically,
the expectation value ho(p ; w)i vanishes because  with a gauge bundle that is nontrivial
when restricted to any arbitrarily large sphere surrounding p  the classical equation of

motion f = 0 of the long distance eective chern-simons theory cannot be obeyed even

near spatial innity.

25

now let us consider a dierent but also standard criterion for screening of magnetic
ux. in this alternative formulation, we quantize the theory on t2  r and interpret
magnetic screening to mean that in the limit of large volume of t2, the ground state
energy is independent of the magnetic ux on t2. with this criterion, magnetic screening
does occur in the three-dimensional n = 1 gauge theories for all allowed k  h/2 since, as
we have seen in sections 2 and 3, tr (1)f is nonzero and hence the ground state energy
vanishes whether there is magnetic ux or not.

thus, the two standard criteria for magnetic connement give dierent answers in

these theories. the key dierence between the two criteria is that there are at connections
on a bundle over t2 with magnetic ux, but not on such a bundle over s2. as far as i know,

the distinction between the two notions of magnetic screening has not been important in

massive phases of gauge theories that have been studied previously.

generalization

part of the above story is special to three dimensions, but part is not.

one basic question is how to describe the long distance limit of a theory. it is conven-

tionally claimed that the long distance limit of a massive theory is trivial, but the very

idea of t hooft and wilson loops as criteria for connement shows that there is more to

say about the long distance limit of a massive theory than just this.

the lesson from the above discussion is that a massive theory may give at long dis-

tances a nontrivial topological eld theory, which governs the possible vacuum states in

dierent conditions, even though there are no physical excitations at very long wave-

lengths. topological eld theory is particularly interesting in three-dimensions because of

the existence of the chern-simons theories. in four dimensions, the known examples are

less interesting. the most obvious example of a topological eld theory in four dimensions

(or indeed in any dimension) is a gauge theory with a nite gauge group .

if such a

theory is quantized on a three-manifold x, the number of physical states is the number of

conjugacy classes of representations of the fundamental group of x into . (these theories

have been discussed in [21], including also a generalization involving a group cohomology

class. the generalization leads to a somewhat more elaborate formula for the number of

physical states.) in particular, these theories do depend on .

consider a weakly coupled four-dimensional theory with mass gap in which, pertur-

batively, a connected simple gauge group g is spontaneously broken to a nite subgroup

. from the point of view of the usual criteria involving t hooft and wilson loops, these

26

theories are all higgs theories. for example, by virtue of the perturbative higgs mecha-

nism, the wilson loops can be computed reliably in perturbation theory and show no area
t hooft loops do show an area law, since a bundle on s2 with nontrivial magnetic
law.
ux cannot have a -valued connection, so a path integral with such a bundle (on an s2

that links an t hooft loop) cannot receive a contribution in the low energy theory.

nevertheless, order parameters distinguishing such theories have been constructed [22].

we can reformulate this discussion to some extent and say that a basic order parameter is

the topological eld theory that prevails at long distances. it is simply a gauge theory of

the nite group .

here is a simple yet interesting example. take g = so(3) and let  be the subgroup 
isomorphic to z2  z2  consisting of diagonal matrices with entries 1 (and determinant
1). as we have already explained, magnetic ux wrapped on s2 is unscreened, and the t
hooft loops show area law. however, in such a theory, magnetic ux on t2 is screened. this
is so simply because a bundle on t2 with nonzero magnetic ux admits a at connection
with holonomies in . the holonomies around the two directions in t2 can be the matrices

u =

1
0
0 1
0

0
0
0 1

 , v =

1
0
0 1
0
0

0
0
1

 .

(4.4)

a at bundle with these holonomies has nonzero magnetic ux since the matrices u and

v , if lifted to su (2), do not commute. this gives an elementary four-dimensional example

in which standard criteria for magnetic screening give dierent results, somewhat as we

found in three dimensions.
