lorentzinvariance realization global so(2)duality group manifest symmetry theory. rst symmetry consistency requirement theory itself, second appears supplementary property inherent classical generalized maxwell equations, including magnetic charges. problem lorentzinvariance usually entangled dependence quantum theory unphysical diracstring. precisely, paper call diracstring par- ticle twodimensional hypersurface swept string time evolution; boundary spacetime particle trajectory. fundamental starting point theory charges monopoles classical generalized maxwell equations: f = je f =

electric magnetic charges (er, gr) masses mr, r = 1, , n, involve generalized lorentzforce read mr du r dr = (erf (yr) + gr f (yr)) ur, (1.3) r particles trajectories, u r = dy r dr , r proper time. classical eld theory (1.3) replaced dirac kleingordon equations, requires also introduction vector potentials. spite manifest lorentzinvariance (1.1)(1.3), construction classical invariant action, deduced, involves already problem: one renounce either locality  manifest lorentzinvariance . problematic aspects one encounters beginning specially missing manifest lorentzinvariance prevented long time also construction consistent quantum theory. classical pointparticle theory features eventually saved , relies heavily pointparticle nature charged matter. quantum level implementation lorentzinvariance achieved rst brandt, neri zwanziger , using functional integral approach based classical local manifestly so(2)invariant action breaks, however, lorentz invariance, depending xed constant fourvector n. despite explicit breaking lorentz group approach, classical action point particles turns 1 lorentzinvariant dened circle, diracschwinger quantization condition holds. hand, classical eld theory always inconsistent breaks lorentz group, while, strikingly enough, quantum eld theory based inconsistent classical eld theory action turns lorentzinvariant, diracschwinger quantization condition holds. reason essentially quantum theory traced back, multipath feynman expansion functional integral, classical pointlike trajectories (a realization wave/particle quantum duality), classical point particle theory consistent admits invariant exponentiated action. short, exists consistent quantum eld theory charges monopoles, diracschwinger quantization condition holds. exist, actually, two inequivalent classes consistent theories: theories rst class so(2)invariant, manifestly not, theories second class invariant discrete duality group z4, despite so(2)invariance underlying classical equations motion, classes (1.1)(1.3). z4 mean discrete electromagnetic duality group generated (er, gr) (gr,er). dierence two types theories lies mixed quantum interactions charges monopoles. so(2) z4theories respectively two distinct diracschwinger quantization conditions 1 2 (ergs esgr) = 2 nrs ergs = 2 nrs, (1.4) (1.5) r s, nrs integer. rst invariant so(2) second z4. none two conditions implies other. stronger condition 1 2 ergs = 2 nrs (1.6) satised, two theories coincide, see detail text. kind theory describes monopoles depends model one considers. example, fourdimensional eective heterotic string action  (1.4) appropriate, original dirac monopole  one use diracs original condition (1.5). paper concentrate mainly so(2)theory (elaborating details z4theory

method appears particularly suitable formulation quantum eld theory dyons, allows clear distinction problems lorentzinvariance diracstring dependence. principal advantage pstaction is, fact, manifest so(2) lorentzinvariance case free maxwell equations, i.e. (1.1) (1.2) je = 0 = jg. free pstaction admits 2 also natural coupling non vanishing currents, kinematically conserved , case classical point particles. situation action maintains manifest so(2) lorentzinvariance, arbitrary values charges, depends generalized diracstrings. nevertheless, (1.4) holds functional exp(is) string independent gives rise equations motion (1.1)(1.3). hand, construction quantum eld theory functional integral approach, one needs starting point classical eld theory action includes also coupling matter elds, charged spinors scalars. action, however, always inconsistent. fundamental level reason consistent set equations motion describe coupling gauge elds dyonic matter elds, irrespective existence action gives rise them. corresponding classical currents pointlike, spread continuously local electric magnetic uxes noninteger. consequence diracschwinger condition save theory. necessarily resulting inconsistency eld theory action traded several ways, e.g. zwanziger  brandt et. al  sacriced lorentzinvariance keeping locality, authors  keep lorentzinvariance renounce description matter eld
