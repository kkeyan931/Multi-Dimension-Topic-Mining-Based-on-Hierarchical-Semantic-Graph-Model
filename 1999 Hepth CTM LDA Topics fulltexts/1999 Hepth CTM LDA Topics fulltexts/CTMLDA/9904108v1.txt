abstract

the solutions of the arbitrary-spin massless wave equations over r1  h 3 space
are obtained using the generalized coherent states for the lorentz group. the em-
ploying of these solutions for the construction of the invariant propagators over
r1  h 3 space is considered. scalar propagator is obtained in the explicit form.

key words: hyperbolic space, representations of the lorentz group, generalized
coherent states, bargmann-wigner equations, massless elds, invariant propagator.

in our previous paper[1] the method of generalized coherent states (cs) was applied
to the description of the quantum elds over de sitter space. in the present paper such an
approach is applied to the massless elds r1  h 3 space. we write down the bargmann-
wigner equations for the arbitrary-spin particles over minkowski space in the form of
four equations for the 2s + 1-component spinor (or, equivalently, for some polynomial)
and show that only two of these equations are independent. the wave equations over
r1  h 3 space are the covariant generalization of these equations. for the obtaining of
the solutions of these equations we introduce the two systems of cs for the lorentz group.
the rst (scalar) one is determined by the spin zero innite-dimensional representations
of the lorentz group and corresponds to the coset space h 3. the second (spinor) one
corresponds to nite-dimensional representations of the lorentz group and to the coset
space so(3, 1)/{the little lorentz group of the lightlike vector}. multiplied by eit, the
scalar system of cs gives us the solution of the klein-gordon equation for the conformally-
coupled massless eld over r1 h 3 space. the arbitrary-spin wave equations are satised
by the product of the scalar and spinor cs multiplied by eit. these solutions allow us to
construct the secondly quantized elds over r1h 3 space; their propagators are invariant

under r1  so(3, 1) group. here we consider the spin zero case only; it is shown that the
propagator is expressed using the -function, just as in the at case.

the three-dimensional hyperbolic space h 3 is the hypersphere of the radius r in the
ctitious four-dimensional pseudoeuclidean space; then the ctitious fourth coordinate is
rx, where x = x4/r = (1 + x2/r2)1/2. the symmetry group of h 3 space is so(3, 1);
its irreducible representations (j+, j) are well-known [2]. they are determined by two
(complex, in general) numbers j+ and j; these numbers correspond to the eigenvalues
of the casimir operators of the two so(3) subalgebras of so(3, 1) algebra. if j+ and j
are integer or half-integer the representation is nite-dimensional and non-unitary; in
the opposite case the representation is innite-dimensional and unitary. the innite-
dimensional representations may be characterized by the spin s = 0, 1/2, . . . and the
frequency   r; then the weights are equal to

j+ = 

ir + s + 1

j =

ir + s  1

let us take xi as the coordinates over h 3 space; then the internal metric over r1  h 3
reads

gij = ij 

,

g00 = 1 ,

g0i = 0.

then we obtain the klein-gordon equation for the conformally coupled massless spin zero
eld over r1  h 3 space:

( + r2) = 0 ,   ( det g)1/2(( det g)1/2g).

(2)

one can show [3] that if   eit then the above equation determines the irreducible
representation of the lorentz group with the weights (1) at s = 0. it is easy to show that
the functions

(x, t) = eitq(x; ir  1)

, q(x; ) = (cid:18)x

,

(3)

where q2 = 1, obey eq. (2). wave equations for the massless arbitrary spin particles over
minkowski space are [4]

(s + s) = 0,

(4)

where s are the generators of the corresponding nite-dimensional representation of the
lorentz group. following ref.[4], we consider the realization of these representations on
the polynomials of the variables z, z [2]. in such a realization the generators of the lorentz
group are the dierential operators on z, z and the wave functions are the polynomials
from z and z of power no above than 2j+ and 2j respectively. for the deniteness we
restrict ourselves to the case of antiparticles; then we shall deal with the representation
(s, 0) and generators take the form

sik = iikljl

, s0i = ji

j+ =

j = z2

j3 = s  z

where we introduce the indices +,  as a = a1ia2 and ji are the generators of the spin s
nite-dimensional representation of the so(3) group. putting  = i in (4) and expressing
0 using these equations at  = 0 we obtain that these equations are equivalent to

(s0 + jii) = 0
vikk  (sik  s1jijk + iikljl)k = 0.

from here it follows that only one equation among eqs. (6) is independent. let us choose
the equation v+ii = 0. computing the value the weyl tensor one can show that it
vanishes and the space r1  h 3 is conformally-at. then the consistent arbitrary spin
wave equations for the massless particles over this space may be obtained as the covariant
generalization of eqs. (4) by the replacement  to the spinor general-covariant derivative

over r1  h 3 space. the ricci coecients not equal to zero in this vierbein are gikl =
ir1ikl. then using the equality vikjk = 0 the general-covariant generalization of eqs. (5)-
(6) yields

(cid:18)t + s1jiek

(i)k 

s + 1

r (cid:19)  = v+iek

(i)k = 0.

(9)

one can show [3] that at   eit and s = 1/2, 1 the above equations correspond to
the irreducible representations of the lorentz group with the weights (1).
it is well-
known [5] that the basic massless spinors for the nite-dimensional representations of the
lorentz group may be constructed as follows. let us denote the stationary subgroup
of the minkowski lightlike vector (1, 0, 0, 1) as h; this group is called the little lorentz
group too. let us consider in the representation (j+, j) the vector which is h-invariant
within the phase. let us act on this vector by the transformation corresponds to the
transformation of the minkowski space transforming the vector (1, 0, 0, 1) onto the given
lightlike vector n = (, q). the obtained vector from the space of the representation
(j+, j) is just the basic spinor corresponding to the vector n. this scheme coincides

3

with that of the construction of the cs for the space so(3, 1)/h according to the general
method of the construction of cs for the arbitrary lie group [6]. one can show that in
the polynomial form the basic spinors are

|q; j+ji =  

1 + q3

2 !j++j

(1  zq)2j+(1  z q)2j,

(10)

where q = q1+iq2
absence of the multiple j++j. it is easy to show that the equalities

1+q3 . spinors constructed in [4] dier from the above expression by the

(s1qiji  1)|q; s0i = v+iqi|q; s0i = 0
(v+i + iv+mimnqn)|q; s0i = 0
(iimnjmqn  sqi + j i)|q; s0i = 0

(11)
(12)
(13)

hold for any spin. the equality (13) follows from the equality (11) and decomposition (7).
let us construct now the functions

f (s)
q (x) = q(x; ir  s  1)|q; s0i;

in the above expression the spin zero case may be included too. using (11)-(13) yields
that the functions

(x, t) = eitf (s)

q (x)

(14)

obey eq. (9) for the arbitrary spin. putting s = 0 in the above expression yield the
functions (3)1. under r   the functions (14), within the multiplier s, pass onto the
usual plane waves over minkowski space considered in ref.[4]. the solutions obtained by
us are much simpler than the ones obtained for spin 0, 1/2 and 1 particles over einstein
space r1  s3 by the other methods [7].

one can show [6] that the functions q(x; ) are the cs for the some representation of
the lorentz group which is irreducible representation for spin zero particles if  = ir1.
it was stated above that the vectors |q; j+ji are the cs for the space so(3, 1)/h.
then following [1] one can write down the transformation properties of the functions
f (s)
q (x) under the action of the lorentz group and then construct the invariant two-point
functions over h 3 space. also one can construct the secondly quantized massless elds
over r1  h 3 space using the functions (14) and the creation-destruction operators obey
the canonical (anti)commutation relations. the propagators of these elds express using
the mentioned two-point functions over h 3 space. in the present paper we consider the
spin zero case only; in this case propagator may be expressed in the nite form. indeed,
the lorentz-invariant scalar product of the two cs is the two-point function

1the solutions of the massless wave equations may be obtained by the multiplication of the ones over
minkowski space by the conformal factor. however, such a way dont permit us to construct the invariant
propagators.

where the bosonic creation-destruction operators

[a(n), a(n)] = n03(n  n)

are introduced and n = (, q). the choice of measure is correct as  d d2q = (n0)1d3n.
then the corresponding propagator

(x, y)  [(x), (y)] = z 



dei(x0y0)w(x, y; )

(16)

is invariant under the time translations and spatial so(3, 1) transformations. using the
formulas for the hypergeometric functions at the particular values of the parameters [8],
one reduces eq. (15) to

w(x, y; ) =

sin r
r sinh 

.

the above expression coincides with the spherical function for the spin-zero innite-
dimensional representations of the lorentz group [2]. by the simple manipulations with
the -functions one obtains

(x, t1; y, t1 + t) =

2i
sinh 

(t2  r22).

i.e. the massless particles propagate along the deformed light cone; under r   the
above expression passes into the usual massless propagator over minkowski space. it is
of interest to compare our result with the propagator for the conformally-coupled eld of
the mass m > 0 over r1  h 3 space [9]:

g(x, t1; y, t1 + t) =

sinh 

h (2)
1 (cid:16)(m2 + r2)1/2)(t2  r22)(cid:17)

(t2  r22)1/2

.

thus, t2  r22 plays the role of the interval both in the massless case and in the massive
one and also the multiplier

sinh  appears in the both cases.
