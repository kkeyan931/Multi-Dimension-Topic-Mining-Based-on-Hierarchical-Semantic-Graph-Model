abstract

the dynamics of a string near a kaluza-klein black hole are studied. solutions to

the classical string equations of motion are obtained using the world sheet veloc-

ity of light as an expansion parameter. the electrically and magnetically charged

cases are considered separately. solutions for string coordinates are obtained in

terms of the world-sheet coordinate  . it is shown that the kaluza-klein radius

increases/decreases with  for electrically/magnetically charged black hole.

string propagation near a black hole is of great interest because of the inter-

play between the extended probe and the nontrivial background geometry. an

extensive literature (for a review see [1]) deals with the study of classical string

dynamics in curved backgrounds. this investigation is important with a view to

eventually understand and interpret string quantization in curved spacetimes.

a consistent quantization of strings requires string theory to be a higher dimen-

sional theory. the extra dimensions are compactied to obtain four-dimensional

spacetime. 1 it is an important question in string theory to study the mechanism

of this compactication. the extra dimensions are expected to contribute non-

trivially to the dynamics in the vicinity of a black hole, i.e., in the strong gravity

regime. an interesting approach could be to study how the compact extra dimen-

sions unfold as a string falls into a black hole. it is not unreasonable to hope that

a string can be used as a probe to understand how four-dimensional spacetime

arises dynamically from an underlying higher dimensional theory.

the problem is complicated as it involves solving equations of motion in d-

dimensional (d = 26 for bosonic strings and d = 10 for superstrings) space-

time, which includes the compact manifold. as an in-between approach, we study

string propagation in ve- dimensional kaluza-klein black hole backgrounds as

a minimal extension to four-dimensional curved spacetime. these backgrounds

are solutions to the ve-dimensional einstein equations, and include regular four-

dimensional black hole solutions.

the string world-sheet action [3] is given by

1although string theory can be formulated directly in four dimensions [2], the more popular approach is

compactication of the extra dimensions.

where gab = g(x)ax bx  is the two-dimensional world-sheet metric;  and

 are the world sheet coordinates.

dimensional minkowskian metric) are given by

and the constraints are given by

[ x  x  + c2x x ]g = 0.

here c is the velocity of wave propagation along the string.

various simplifying ansatze exist for obtaining solutions to the highly non-

linear system of equations (2)-(4), one being perturbation expansion of string

coordinates. we follow the approach of de vega and nicolaidis [4] which uses the

world-sheet velocity of light as an expansion parameter. the scheme involves sys-

tematic expansion in powers of c. if c << 1, the coordinate expansion is suitable

to describe strings in a strong gravitational background (see [5, 6]). here, the

derivatives w.r.t.  overwhelm the  derivatives. in the opposite case (c >> 1),

the classical equations of motion give us a stationary picture as the  derivatives

dominate.

we restrict ourselves to the case where c is small, our interest being to probe

the dynamical behaviour of the extra dimensions. the string coordinates are

3

expressed as

x (,  ) = a(,  ) + c2b(,  ) + c4c (,  ) + ...,

(5)

and the zeroth order a(,  ) satises the following set of equations(with dot and

prime denoting dierentiation w.r.t.  and  respectively);

a + 


a a = 0,

a ag = 0,

aag = 0.

(6)

these equations describe the motion of a null string [4]. the second constraint is

the stringy constraint and restricts the motion to be perpendicular to the string.

the metric background to study string propagation [7] (see also [8]) is

ds2 = e4k 3 (dx5 + 2kadx)2 + e2k 3 gdxdx,

(7)

where k2 = 4g; x5 is the extra dimension and should be identied modulo 2r0,

where r0 is the radius of the circle about which the coordinate x5 winds. the

quantity r0 is the asymptotic value of a dynamical quantity, the kaluza-klein

radius, which is discussed below. here g is the four-dimensional spacetime.

p are related to the scalar charge  by

we seek to solve the equations of motion for the string coordinates in the exte-

rior of the black hole. for simplicity, we consider the magnetically and electrically

charged cases separately. the equations of motion for string coordinates in the

the structure of the equations in this case is such that they are not reducible

to quadratures and we have to resort to solving them numerically. again, we

consider an infalling string in the region where r >>  and  = /2.

7

the set of equations (15) and (16) has been solved numerically to obtain the

coordinates as functions of  . again we have a two parameter family of solutions.

fig. 3 and fig. 4 illustrate how r and x5 vary as functions of  for dierent

choices of integration constants.

the coordinate x5 increases monotonically in the magnetic case, while in the

electric case, it rst increases and then starts decreasing. the two cases indicate,

in the magnetic case, that the coordinate x5 goes about a circle continuously

in one direction, while in the electric case the direction reverses. although the

behaviour is dierent in the two cases, the picture becomes clear if we dene a

quantity, the kaluza-klein radius, which is related to its asymptotic value r0 as

1/2

r(r) = r0(cid:18)b
a(cid:19)

.

(16)

the radius r(r) is a dynamical quantity as it depends implicitly on  through

r( ) = r(r( )). the eect of the magnetic eld is to shrink the extra dimension

(as already mentioned in [7]) i.e., as the string approaches the black hole, the value

of the kaluza-klein radius which it sees becomes smaller than its asymptotic value.

the presence of electric charge tends to expand the extra dimension. fig. 5 and

fig. 6 clearly show that the behaviour of the kaluza-klein radius is opposite in

the electrically and magnetically charged cases.

we have studied propagation of a null string in ve-dimensional, electrically

and magnetically charged, kaluza-klein black hole backgrounds. our study of

string propagation in kaluza-klein backgrounds is motivated by the importance

of such backgrounds in the context of toroidal compactication schemes for string

theory. here, we have tried to explore the behaviour of the extra fth dimension

8

as the string approaches the black hole horizon. the solutions we have obtained

are valid in the region outside the horizon but not asymptotically far from the

horizon.

the solutions, in the limit   0, match with the ones given in [6]. the
essential dierence lies in the presence of the extra dimension. another paper that

deals with ve-dimensional kaluza-klein black holes [9] nds out string corrections

to the ve-dimensional vacuum einstein equations and their eect on the black

hole metrics. on the other hand our approach is to study the dynamics of a string

probe in a classical background. the two approaches are complementary to each

other.

in the present paper, we have only considered the classical picture. in princi-

ple, however, one expects quantum eects to be dominant in the strong gravity

regime. nevertheless, we expect the classical picture to give an intuitive idea of

the mechanism of compactication. it is clear from the above considerations that,

even in the classical regime, we can probe the expansion/shrinking of the com-

pact dimension. however, the eects of the background (and hence the compact

dimension) on the string probe itself, in terms of changes in its shape and con-

formation, are identically zero in the zeroth order of the expansion in c. these

eects are expected to manifest themselves if we go to higher orders in c. work

on this is in progress and will be reported elsewhere.
