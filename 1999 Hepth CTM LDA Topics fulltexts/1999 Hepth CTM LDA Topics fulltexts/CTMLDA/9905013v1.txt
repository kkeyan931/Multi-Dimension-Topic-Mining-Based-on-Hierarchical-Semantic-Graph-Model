abstract

the production of electron-positron pairs in a time-dependent mag-
netic eld is estimated in the hypotheses that the magnetic eld is uniform
over large distances with respect to the pair localization and it is so strong
that the spacing of the landau levels is larger than the rest mass of the
particles. this calculation is presented since it has been suggested that
extremely intense and varying magnetic elds may be found around some
astrophysical objects.

1. statement of the problem

standard q.e.d. clearly states that a static electric eld of sucient
strength and extension can create pairs of opposite charges through a tun-
nel eect [1,2], but the same kind of production is not foreseen for magnetic
elds in the same conditions, unless one would take into account the pro-
duction of monopole pairs. the situation changes if the external elds vary
in time and the eect of the eld variation on the pair production rates
has been discussed in detail in connection with the possibility of detecting
these eects in experiments in optics [3], where the time dependence of
the eld is explicitly taken into account, with an essential negative an-
swer, at least for the real pair production.* it may be possible that pairs
are created in the presence of very large eld strengths with time varia-
tion which is not too small; since it has been proposed that situations of
this kind could take place in some phases of neutron star evolution[5,6],
a preliminary investigation on the pair production in a very strong and
non constant magnetic eld is presented here. no detailed quantitative
calculation is performed, but some order of magnitude estimates are given
in order to show that the model calculation that will be presented can be
well suited for the conditions referred to above.

these conditions correspond to a very intense magnetic, over 1010t ,
which remains constant over distances which are large in comparison with
the dimensions involved in the electron production, during the time of
variation the spatial uniformity is conserved, in this rst investigation
only a change of strength at constant direction is considered.

the rapidity of change cannot be too small in order for the production
process not to be entirely negligible, but since it involves macroscopic
objects it will be slow enough to allow the adiabatic treatment of the
production process[7]. for the ratio between the magnetic and the rest
energy, dened as  = (2heb)/(mec)2, we obtain for the chosen values of
b,  > 4.5, which allows some computational simplications that will be
used.

2. determination of the production rate

the production rate is calculated here in the following external eld
conguration: the magnetic eld grows at xed direction, this could hap-
pen locally, in the case of a collapsing neutron star, when a compression
of the magnetic eld takes place[6].

* the eect of virtual pairs in external elds is a dierent issue, which is under

investigation also experimentally[4], but it will not be discussed here.

2

in order to x notations and conventions some well known features of
the relativistic electron in static uniform magnetic eld are rewritten here.
the dirac equation* h = [~  (~p + e ~a) + m] =  is written as:

(cid:18)

m

~  (~p + e ~a)

~  (~p + e ~a)

m

(cid:19)(cid:18) 

(cid:19) = (cid:18) 
(cid:19)

and the system is solved for  when  > 0 and for  when  < 0 .
when the eld becomes time dependent, the choice of the vector po-
tential for the magnetic eld becomes physically relevant, dierent choices
yielding the same magnetic eld give rise to dierent electric elds. so
a choice is unavoidable: when the magnetic eld is taken as constant in
direction and varying in strength a cylindrical conguration, dened by
2~r  ~b, will be studied. decomposing the variables into transverse
~a =  1
and longitudinal components (the longitudinal direction is called z), the
equation for  is

[p2

z + p2

t + 1

4 e2r2

t b2 + eb(lz + z)] = [2  m2]

the variables pz and z are diagonalized with eigenvalues k and s

with the position

we obtain

 =

1
z

eikzk,s ,

[p2

t + 1

4 e2r2

t b2 + eb(lz + s)]k,s = (2  k2  m2)k,s .

for future use the solution of the remaining equation is expressed in term
of the harmonic-oscillator operators. following ref.[8] one can dene:

av = (pv/b  ibv)/2 with v = x, y

b2 = 1

2 eb

ad = (ax  iay)/2 , ag = (ax + iay)/2 , nd = a

dad , ng = a

gag

and express in this way the operators pt , rt , lz. the nal result is :

2 = m2 + k2 + eb(2nd + 1 + s) .

the operators nd , ng are standard number operators, we respectively
call n ,  their eigenvalues and remark two known results relevant for the

* here e > 0 so the charge of the electron is e.

next developments: the quantum number  has no inuence on the value
of the energy; the lowest landau level, dened by n = 0 and s = 1, has
an energy independent of the strength of b.
the second order equation for  is the same as the equation for ;

the normalized solutions of the original equation are:

+ = n (cid:18) 

w+m (cid:19) ,  = n (cid:18) p

w+m 


p

(cid:19)

p = ~  (~p + e ~a)

, w = ||

, n = p(w + m)/2w

the second quantized electronic eld is decomposed in terms of these

solutions

 = xj

cj+,j +xj

j,j  = xj
d

j
c

+,j + dj

,j

so the standard representation of the (second quantized) hamiltonian is
produced:

h = z d3r(~r)[~  (~p + e ~a) + m](~r) = xj

wj[c

jcj  djd
j] .

the index j embodies all the relevant quantum numbers j  (k, n, , s),
of course when they are read as positron quantum numbers, the sign of k
and s must be reversed.

now the variation of the hamiltonian with time is given writing

~b = b~ and b = bo + bt and dening h = h/b and  = 1
in terms of the harmonic-oscillator operators, eq.(4), it results:

2 (xiy).

h =  1

2 e~  ~r  ~ = i

the derivative of the second quantized hamiltonian is then:

when we are interested in the transition from the vacuum to the electron-
positron pair conguration only the second of the four addenda is in-
teresting and will therefore be calculated explicitly; all the addenda are
important for higher order corrections.

before going on with the calculation of the matrix element, the fol-
t is found to

[8]), is useful: the mean value of r2

lowing observation (ref.
be

< n, |r2

t|n,  >= (n +  + 1)/b2

in semiclassical states not having sharp eigenvalues the mean value be-
comes *

<< n, |r2

t|n,  >> (  n)2/b2 .

in both cases one observes that n cannot grow too much because it costs
energy eq.(5), while  can grow without cost; so if the space at disposal of
the system is large in most congurations we shall nd

< n, |r2

t|n,  > /b2 .

it is, therefore, convenient to dene  = b2r2 and r may be interpreted
as the mean position; the sum over  which at the end occurs, is converted

into an integration according to p  b2r dr2. the region of integration
will certainly be large, as compared with the microscopic lengths, so the
terms containing r will be the most important and they will be calculated
g  brei. the
using the approximate representation ag  brei , a
conclusion is that the dominant contribution for macroscopic extension of
the magnetic eld may be extracted after reducing the expression of h to
the much simpler form

* this procedure is similar to the treatment of a condensed bose system, where

one puts a  a

from this form it appears that the two produced particles cannot have
wholly equal quantum numbers, in particular it is impossible that both are
produced in the ground state. there are eight relevant matrix elements
which are listed as follows.

t1 =< , n|m|+, n >= ei  k2ei[(w+,n + m)(w,n + m)]1
t2 =< +, n|m|, n >= ei + k2ei[(w+,n + m)(w,n + m)]1
t3 =< +, n|m|+, n + 1 >= 2kbein + 1[(w+,n + m)(w+,n+1 + m)]1
2kbein + 1[(w+,n + m)(w+,n+1 + m)]1
t4 =< +, n + 1|m|+, n >= 
2kbein + 1[(w,n + m)(w,n+1 + m)]1
t5 =< , n|m|, n + 1 >= 
t6 =< +, n + 1|m|+, n >= 2kbein + 1[(w,n + m)(w,n+1 + m)]1
t7 =< +, n|m|, n + 2 >= 2b2eip(n + 1)(n + 2)[(w,n+2 + m)(w+,n + m)]1
t8 =< , n + 2|m|+, n >= 2b2eip(n + 1)(n + 2)[(w+,n + m)(w,n+2 + m)]1

(13)

further simplication is gained for strong magnetic elds, in fact in
this case the excited landau levels are very far from the fundamental one
so the production of an electron-positron pair in their ground state would
strongly be favoured, but it has just been seen that this transition is not
allowed and at most one particle may be found in the ground state of its
transverse motion. we may neglect the mass term in comparison with the
magnetic energy and write:

w+,n = p4b2(n + 1) + k2 , w,n = p4b2n + k2 if n > 0
w,0  wk = pm2 + k2 .

(14)

the dominant terms for large b of the matrix elements are independent of
b and they are explicitly:

t1 =  t 
t3 =  t 
t5 =  t 
t7 =  t 

2  ei
4  0
6  eik/(wk + m) if n = 0
8  1

2 ei .

t5 =  t 

6  0 if n > 0

(13)

the same approximation is introduced into the normalization factors and

for them it results n  1/2, but for n,0 = p(wk + m)/2wk. the

amplitude for the pair production is written in terms of the standard adi-
abatic expression [7], with the following specications: only the transition
from the vacuum to the two particle state is considered; the reduction of

6

amplitude of the vacuum state is not taken into account; the initial instant
of the process is not pushed to , but it is some nite time, t = 0, in
which the eld b(0) = bo is already large. this is expressed writing the
adiabatic projection coecient [7] j,j  as:
< j, j|h/b| >

j,j (t) =  bz t

o exp(cid:2)iz 

o

edt(cid:3) :

with e = wj + wj  , eq (14).
from now on we refer to the matrix elements t1, t2, in the other cases

slight modications are required.

it is convenient to separately treat the n = 0 and the n > 0 contribu-
tions. in this last case, in which the sum over all n will be performed, we
shall set n  n + 1 and in so doing

the parameters s are very large in all the interesting situations. this is
better appreciated if we insert the powers of c, h that are needed to come

moreover, since s(t) is very large, the term containing cos[sos(t)] which
appears in |j |2 is rapidly varying around 0 and it will be dropped in the
following. this us allows to write:

it may be veried that / 2 is of the order 1/s. going on as in the

rapidly oscillating term and we obtain:

|jo|2  (cid:2)k +p2ebo + k2(cid:3)4

* it is possible to give a close expression for f , in terms of the irregular conuent

the production rate in a cylinder of height z and radius rm , in a uniform
and very strong magnetic eld, varying linearly with time is given approx-
imately by di/dt. if we evaluate di/dt we obtain a cubic dependence on
b, built up by an original linear dependence of the transition amplitude,
which is standard in the adiabatic processes and has to be squared, and by
the dependence on b which is mainly related with the fact that the pro-
duced state extends over a transverse region becoming smaller and smaller
as the magnetic eld grows.

while the dependence on the longitudinal variable is trivial the de-
pendence on the transverse one, i.e. the fourth power, is less obvious and
it may be understood if we remember that the conguration is not trans-
lationally invariant in the transverse dimension.
in fact, although the
magnetic eld is uniform, the electric eld e grows linearly with r and
this puts an evident limitation to the congurations one can consider: in
br > b cannot t in this treat-
fact too large values of r such that e = 1
ment. it is pleasant to nd a numerical conrmation of the intuitive idea
that the n = 0 conguration must be important, in fact |jo| > |j |. the
rest of the factors strongly depend on the details of the chosen congura-
tion. in particular there must be a further and not very large factor which
takes into account the other transition-matrix elements ti , i > 2 .

3. conclusions and outlook

a calculation of the pair production in a time-dependent magnetic
eld has been presented, in a simple situation where the already strong
b > 0. this process is suggested by
eld is still growing in a xed direction,
the consideration of an imploding neutron star where the magnetic eld is
locally compressed [6]. the choice of a very strong eld has a less dramatic
eect on the production rate than one could have expected at rst sight.
in fact, to the growth of the state density in x-space there corresponds a
growth in the distance among the energy levels and therefore a decrease

9

of density in momentum space. a stronger production rate could take
place if both produced particles could be found in the ground state, but
the dynamics does not allow this process. we may note, however, that as
the distance of the landau level grows there is an increasing number of
longitudinal levels between two transverse levels, the convergence in the
longitudinal momentum is always rapid, as dk/k4, so the dependence on k
which has been neglected in the terms ti cannot play any important role.
a more formal and general observation can be done: the total angular

momentum ~j = r d3r ~r [~e  ~b] is zero in the considered volume and eld

conguration while an e e+ pair in the lowest energy level has no orbital
momentum and opposite spins, so the total angular momentum is 1, the
transition is therefore impossible.

another interesting conguration could be given by a magnetic eld
which changes its direction, like e.g. that one could nd around a rotating
neutron star [5]. the adiabatic formalism is certainly still useful, a rst
look at the problem shows that in this case some dierence in the treatment
is needed since the adiabatic states are, of course, time dependent, but the
energy levels remain constant. anyhow a more detailed investigation is
required in order to obtain a denite answer.

much more complicated is the possibility that an intense magnetic
eld may act together with the qcd vacuum leading to an enhanced
production of quarks and so, nally, of hadrons. similar eects have in
fact been proposed [10], but any quantitative estimate is very uncertain.

this argument was suggested to me by prof. g. barbiellini who,
more in general, called my attention to the relevance of strong eld qed
processes in astrophysics.
