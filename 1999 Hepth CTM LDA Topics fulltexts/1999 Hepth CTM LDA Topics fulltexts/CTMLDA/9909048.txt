(this issue argued detail around end section 2.) rst paper , universe assumed 3-brane negative tension whereas 3-brane positive tension regarded hidden universe. think natural scale hidden world order planck scale, electroweak scale generated universe red-shift factor selecting rather small size extra dimension. thus, purpose paper present resolution hierarchy problem. hand, second paper {$9906064$}, model setup converse compared rst paper . is, universe assumed 3-brane positive tension origin whereas 3-brane negative tension regarded hidden universe. moreover, 3-brane negative tension moved innity, thus providing example non-compact extra dimension. remarkable thing even without mass gap massless graviton continuous kaluza-klein spectrum, four- dimensional newtons law

single 3-brane negative tension (regulator brane) setup consistent einstein equation. one motivations paper show explicitly setup indeed compatible einstein equation. however, so, outset need introduce number negative tension 3-branes positive tension 3-branes model, take suitable limit order move negative tension 3-branes innity. course, extreme case negative tension 3-branes coincident, model would become equivalent lykken randall. motivations behind study hand follows. paper, make use solutions satisfying einstein equation, found previous work {$9908104$}. stated paper, new solutions describe many domain walls standing along fth dimension topology s1 ve-dimensional anti-de sitter space-time, realize many universe cosmology. solutions involve number positive tension 3-branes negative tension 3-branes, thus result, total number 3-branes even. quite unfair democracy even universes exist model. shown later construct plausible model number d3-branes positive tension moving negative tension o3-planes innity. another important motivation study relevant recent interesting work di- enes et al . paper, phenomenological diculties associated randall- sundrum scenario extension pointed possible resolutions puzzles speculated. specially, concluded randall-sundrum model can- simultaneously generate planck/electroweak hierarchy (mass hierarchy) explain gauge coupling unication. conclusion physically sensible, course, original randall-sundrum model, exists single red-shift factor depending relative dis- tance two 3-branes. red-shift factor operates universally mass scales universe dicult generate two mass scales, electroweak scale gut scale, universe without recourse additional mechanisms. one interesting resolution puzzle consider least three universe model one

(13) (14) (15) reason mentioned paper {$9908104$}, solution (10) relation (12) characteristic feature f (l2i1) = 0 (or equivalently, u(l2i1) = 1) undesired feature explaining mass hierarchy. thus, order avoid feature, imposed relation (15), specially, l3 > 2l2 solution (13). indeed, shown next section, type solution desired feature respect mass hierarchy trapping gravity. note positive tension domain walls located z = l1 0, l3 negative tension domain walls z = l2, l4 seen eq.(14). comparison ref.{$9908076$}, according terminology, may call positive tension 3-branes z = l1 0 z = l3 tev brane planck brane, respectively 2. might appear dicult move two negative tension branes innity without changing essential contents model since negaive positive tension branes adjacent solution (13). analysis next section reveals procedure carried taking limit l2, 2l l4 keeping l3 2l2 nite. way, construct model consisting two positive tension domain walls separated distance along non-compact fth dimension. 2our setup dierent ref.{$9908076$} planck brane tev brane put z = l1 0 z = l3, respectively. one modify present setup coincide setup without diculty. 6 next let us present model including general n1 2 positive tension domain walls straightforward generalization model two positive tension domain walls. model given terms eq.(10) satisfying eq.(11) modied relations among li compared eq.(12), limiting procedure. convenience, let us write explicitly general model n1 2 positive tension d3-branes: n1 f (z) = f (z) = f (z) = 2 n1 n1 (1)i+1|z li| + l, xi=2 (1)i+1(z li) 1, xi=1 xi=1 (1)i+1(z li), l2i = l2i1 = n1 6k 2 , l = xi=2 (1)ili, l1 0, ln 2l, = 1, 2, , n1 2 . limiting procedure given f (l2i) , keeping f (l2i1) nite, negative values. (16) (17) 4 exponential mass hierarchy newtons law previous section, presented concrete model ready consider model resolves problems mass hierarchy trapping gravity. previous section, let us start model two positive tension domain walls. following formula given ref.{$9908104$}, straightforward evaluate mass scale m(0) tev brane located z = l1 0 mass scale m(l3) planck brane located z = l3 planck mass scale allocated. result form m(0) = ek(l32l2)m(l3). (18) stated previous section, since taken l3 2l2 positive nite value, resolve mass hierarchy l3 2l2 order 10. words, mass scale universe (tev brane) order electroweak scale thanks red-shift factor geometry planck mass scale assigned another positive tension domain wall (planck brane) z = l3 l3 2l2 order 10. next, let us turn attention problem trapping gravity tev brane. that, consider linearlized approximation metric tensor examine small 7 uctuations h around four-dimensional minkowski metric brane determine graviton spectrum well kaluza-klein spectrum. accordingly, assume form ds2 = gm n dxm dxn = e2kf (z) ( + h(x, z)) dxdx + dz2. (19) then, gauge conditions h equation form = h = 0, leading order h, eld 1 2 e2kf (z)h 1 2 + 2k2h kf (z)h = 0, h (20) denotes space-time four-dimensional laplacian operator, f (z) dened eq.(13). stage, consider plane wave uctuations h(x, z) = eipx h(z), p2 = m2, eq.(20) reduces dierential equation h(z) " m2 2 e2kf (z) 1 2 2 z + 2k2 kf (z)# h(z) = 0, (21) (22) convenient rewrite eq.(22) one-dimensional schrodinger wave- equation making change variables, = 1 k ekf (z) + v (y)(cid:21) (y) = m2 2 (y), 1 2 (cid:20) 2 dened h(z) k 1 2 1 2 (y), (y) (y). one-dimensional potential given v (y) = 15 8 1 y2 2  , yi(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) form y1 = y2 = y3 = y4 = 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 k , ekl2, ek(l32l2), ek(2ll4), 8 (23) (24) (25) (26) thus relation 0 < y3 < y1 < y2 < y4, (27) without loss generality assumed y2 < y4. interesting thing happened owing eq.(15). namely, change variables z caused rearrangement positions domain walls two positive tension 3-branes located left side two negative tension 3-branes, move two negative tension 3-branes innity taking limit l2, 2l l4 keeping l3 2l2 nite. note two positive tension 3-branes stay points limit. one-dimensional schrodinger wave-equation eq.(23) gives rise much useful infor- mations graviton tower kaluza-klein modes. luckily enough, potential v (y) similar form refs. take results obtained present case appropriate modication. first all, poten- tial v (y) -functions = y1, y3 negative coecients, means -functions supports normalizable bound state mode, course nothing massless graviton. incidentally, regulator branes negative brane tension locating = y2, y4, though moved innity, induce -functions positive coe- cients potential v (y), branes cannot support massless graviton. reason ref.{$9906064$}, randall sundrum regarded 3-brane positive tension universe trapping graviton brane. second, let us focus attention properties continuous kk modes. point, leading approximation, safely neglect existence -functions potential v (y). then, turns squared mass m2 kk modes positive denite desired. non-compact limit, potential falls zero, mass gap massless graviton kk modes. rst sight, could signal danger since tower kk modes would give measurable eects modication newtons law, shown shortly, give rise small corrections newtons law . easily write general solution continuous kk modes m(y) 5 2 k2 y"y2(my) + 4k2 m2 j2(my)# , (28) y2 j2 denote bessel functions order 2. wave function, straightforward evaluate corrections newtons law continuous kk modes . fact, gravitational potential two masses m1 m2 takes form polar coordinate u(r) = gn m1m2 r +z 0 dm k gn m1m2emr r = gn m1m2 r (cid:18)1 + 1 k2r2(cid:19) . (29) accordingly, turns observer living tev brane (and also planck brane) sees gravity essentially four-dimensional since corrections newtons law kk modes small. (note k taken order planck scale.) 9 above, case two d3-branes positive tension investigated detail. analysis general model eqs.(16) (17) quite straightforward similar case two d3-branes, repeat paper. instance, schrodinger wave-equation (23), modication lies form potential v (y) n 1 -functions appear instead 4 -functions. hence, show trapping gravity d3-branes again. hand, hierarchy problem, one also show electroweak scale generated universe planck scale assigned hidden universe appropriate value distance two universes chosen. however, general model, whole story since many red-shift factors arising relative distances universe remaining hidden universes. issue worthy study reported detail separate publication . 5 discussions paper, investigated problems mass hierarchy trapping gravity universe using solutions describing many domain walls previously found present author {$9908104$}. model general consists number positive tension d3-branes non-compact extra dimension, shows exponential mass hierarchy trapping gravity universe. sense, study hand shows scenario lykken randall {$9908076$} indeed realized. since various matters gauge elds also localized d3-brane universe terms mechanism string theory, model equipped necessary conditions realistic model. thus, future directions work would apply model unsolved problems. fact, easily point model following advantages original randall-sundrum model. context cosmology, since exist positive tension d3-branes model, lack friedmann-like expanding universe certainly resolved . and, context phenomenology, puzzles stated recent study  seem also resolved terms general model including many d3-branes since single many red-shift factors associated many domain walls. problems reported separate publication .
