abstract

winding number transitions from quantum to classical behavior are stud-

ied in the case of the 1+1 dimensional mottolawipf model with the space

coordinate on a circle for exploring the possibility of obtaining transitions of

second order. the model is also studied as a prototype theory which demon-

strates the procedure of such investigations. in the model at hand we nd

that even on a circle the transitions remain those of rst order.

i. introduction

the study of transitions from quantum behavior to classical behavior has attracted

considerable attention recently as a result of extension of semiclassical vacuum instanton

considerations to those of periodic instantons and sphalerons, and the consequent possibility

to study such theories at higher temperatures []. in these earlier investigations the order of

the transitions was inferred from monotonically decreasing or nondecreasing behavior of the

period of the periodic pseudoparticle congurations. but in other contexts []it was shown

that one can derive criteria for the occurrence of such phase transitions of one type or the

other by expanding the eld concerned about the sphaleron conguration. this idea was

then further exploited []to obtain concrete conditions in the form of inequalities for a large

class of quantum mechanical models, applications of which can be found in [].

the period  is related to the energy e in the standard way, i.e. e = s

 , where s() is

the action of the periodic instanton (bounce) per period. such periodic instantons (bounces)

smoothly interpolate between the zero temperature instantons (bounces) and the static

solution named sphaleron at the top of the potential barrier. the sphaleron is responsible

for thermal hopping. with increasing temperature thermal hopping becomes more and

more important and beyond some critical or crossover temperature tc becomes the decisive

mechanism. it is more dicult to study such phase transitions in the context of eld theory.

however, as mentioned, the criterion for a rst order transition can be obtained by studying

the euclidean time period in the neighborhood of the sphaleron. if the period (e  u0) of
the periodic instanton (bounce) close to the barrier peak can be found, a sucient condition
for a rst order transition is seen to be the inequality (e  u0)  s < 0 or 2 > 2
s,
where u0 denotes the barrier height and s is the period of small oscillation around the

sphaleron. here  and s are the corresponding frequencies. the frequency of the sphaleron

s is the frequency of small oscillatons at the bottom of the inverted potential well. the

winding number transition in the o(3) model with and without a skyrme term has been

successfully analysed with such a criterion in ref. []; other applications have been carried out

in refs. []

in ref. [] the theory dened by the following euclidean action was considered

se = z d dx(cid:20)1

it was found that the quantum classical transition is always of the smooth second order

type for a noncompactied spatial coordinate. if one considers the same theory with x on

s1, the theory can become rst order when the elliptic modulus k of the periodic solution
is subjected to a condition k < k < 1. the limit of decompactication (i.e. s1  r)
is given by k = 1. if we write our criterion inequality f < 0 and plot f versus k, then a

rstorder transition implies that f < 0 for k < k. thus one can conclude that either (i)

compactication prefers a rstorder transition, or (ii) compactication changes the type of

transition. in the following we investigate which of these possibilities is right in the case

of the compactied mottolawipf model, for which the uncompactied limit is always of

rstorder, as shown in []. since the mottolawipf model serves as an important testing

ground of many eld theoretical aspects, it is desirable to explore what happens in its case

with compactication. if (i) is correct, the compactied case implies a stronger tendency to

rstorder behavior, if (ii) is correct one expects a sign change in f , and so a rising behavior

below a critical value of k. in the following we shall see that case (i) applies.

ii. the sphaleron and expansion around it

the euclidean time action of the mottolawipf model [] is given by

s =

1

g2 z d dx(cid:20) 1

2

nana + (1 + n3)(cid:21)

where a = 1, 2, 3, nana = 1,  = , x. the equation of motion is

(ab  nanb)nb = (a3  nan3).

the static and so only xdependent sphaleron solution is given by

nsph(x) = ( sin fs(x), 0, cos fs(x)),

fs(x) = 2 arcsin[ksn(x)]

(2)

(3)

(4)

where k is the elliptic modulus of the jacobian elliptic functions involved and (later) k2 =
1  k2. for the expansion around the sphaleron conguration we set
1 + u2(cid:18)  sin(fs + v), u, cos(fs + v)(cid:19)

n(x,  ) =

(5)

1

where u(x,  ) and v(x,  ) are uctuation elds. inserting this ansatz into the equation of

motion, we obtain after some tedious calculations the following set of equations

v(cid:19) = h(cid:18)u

we now consider the spectrum of h and write

hn = hnn.

(11)

the eigenfunctions and respective eigenvalues of eq.(11) depend, of course, on the boundary

conditions of the theory. we set

n(x,  ) = (n1(x,  ), n2(x,  ), n3(x,  ))

and consider the following boundary conditions:

(i)periodic boundary conditions

n1(x + 4k,  ) = n1(x,  ), n2(x + 4k,  ) = n2(x,  ), n3(x + 4k,  ) = n3(x,  )

(12)

(ii)partially antiperiodic boundary conditions

5

n1(x + 2k,  ) = n1(x,  ), n2(x + 2k,  ) = n2(x,  ), n3(x + 2k,  ) = n3(x,  )
then up to the rst order

where

n = nsph + n

(13)

(14)

nsph = (2ksn(x)dn(x), 0, 2dn2(x)  1), n = ((2dn2(x)  1)v, u,2ksn(x)dn(x)v).

(15)

thus in the case of periodic boundary conditions we need uctuation elds u and v which

have the period 4k and all 8 cases of table 1 are possible. the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues

of eq.(11) are then of the following type:

0 = (0, 0),

u
0 < 0,

1 = (1, 0),

u
1 < 0,

2 = (0, 0),

v
0 < 0,

3 = (2, 0),

u
2 = 0,

4 = (0, 1),

v
1 = 0,

5 = (3, 0),

u
3 > 0,

6 = (0, 2),

v
2 > 0,

7 = (4, 0),

u
4 > 0.

(16)

hence h has three negative modes and two zero modes in this case. thus it is impossible to

analyse the phase transition problem properly in the case of periodic boundary conditions.

in the second case of partially antiperiodic boundary conditions our ndings of the spec-

trum of h are as follows. considering again eq.(15) one can show that with 2kantiperiodic

u and v satisfying

u(x + 2k) = u(x),

v(x + 2k) = v(x)

the eigenfunctions n and eigenvalues n become those given in table 2 below.

3 = (0, 2)

h2 = v

2 = k2

since this case produces only one negative eigenmode we can consider the winding number

transition with our method.

iii. derivation of the criterion inequality

the calculation of the inequality proceeds as in []. we restrict ourselves to a presentation

of the main steps. we set (cf. table 1)

u0(x) = 1(x) = c1cn(x)dn(x)

using r k

k dx1(x)1(x) = 1, the normalization constant c1 is found to be

c1 = (cid:20) 2

3k2(cid:26)(1 + k2)e  (1  k2)k(cid:27)(cid:21) 1

2

(17)

where k(k) is the quarter period introduced earlier and e(k) the complete elliptic integral

of the second kind (here and elsewhere we use formulas of ref. []). we let a be a small
amplitude around the sphaleron. then, with sph = 3k, the condition for a rst order

transition can be written

where

2
sph  2 = a2 < u0|gu,1 > < 0

(18)

gu,1(x) = 2ksn(x)cn(x)dn2(x)(gv,1(x) + gv,2(x)/2)  4kc1cn2(x)dn(x)(gv,1(x) + gv,2(x)/2)

iv. evaluation of the quantities ii(k)

it is now necessary to evaluate the quantities entering the criterion inequality. since this

is nontrivial we consider these individually.

the quantity i1(k)

we consider rst the case of k = 1. in this case gv,1(x) becomes

gv,1(k = 1, x) =

27
8

hv

sinh x
cosh6 x

,

1

hv

(k = 1) = 

2
x2 + (1  2/ cosh2 x).

(25)

since the operator hv

1

(k = 1) is of the usual poschlteller type, the complete spectrum

can be obtained and is summarised in table 3.

using the completeness relation one can evaluate gv,1(k = 1, x). we nd

(1 + 2 cosh2 x).

(26)

by inserting this into eq.(25) one can verify that this is correct. the k = 1 limit of i1(k)

can now be easily obtained as

i1(k = 1) = 

36
35

= 1.02857.

(27)

since this is negative it is indicative of support for a rst order contribution.

in order to obtain the kdependence of i1(k), we can proceed in two ways: we can

derive rst an approximate expression, and then the exact one. it is instructive to derive

the approximation rst. thus from eq.(20)

gv,1 =

=

(28)

since we know only |1 > and |2 > (the former, the zero mode, does not contribute to
(28)), we approximate the expression (28) as follows.

gv,1(k, x) =

d2 =

(29)

(30)

k being the quarter period introduced earlier and e the complete elliptic integral of the

second kind. the approximation is valid provided |2 > is an isolated discrete mode and
the density of higher states is dilute. but if one checks the spectra of hv(k = 1) (see also
below) and hv in general, one can see that |2 > is the lowest continuum mode of hv(k = 1).
this is why d2(k = 1) = 0, and so this approximation is not valid around k = 1, as can also

be seen from a plot of i1(k) with this approximation in fig.1.

in appendix a we derive the exact value of gv,1(k, x) using the zero mode of hv. the

result is

gv,1(k, x) =

k

in the limit k  1 these quantities are such that

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

in agreement with eq.(26). the expression i1 can now be evaluated numerically; its behavior

is also shown in fig.1. one can see agreement with our k  1 limit, and that our initial
approximation applies in the small k region. from the latter we deduce that the lame

equation has very dilute discrete higher states in that domain.

the quantity i2(k)

using the spectrum of hv(k = 1) one can derive an integral representation of gv,2(k =

1, x), i.e.

10

gv,2(k = 1, x) =

cos kcx.

(35)

with this we obtain for the k = 1 limit of i2(k)

i2(k = 1) =

(36)

the negative sign of i2 indicates that it also contributes to make the transition of rst order.

to our knowledge an exact evaluation of i2(k) is not possible. we therefore adopt for two

reasons the above approximate procedure used for the calculation of i1(k). (i) from the

result of the limit k = 1 one can conjecture that i2(k) is very small in magntitude compared

with i1(k); hence its contribution would not change the type of transition.

(ii) from a

knowledge of the type of transition at k = 1, the interest is shifted to the domain of small

k, and in this region our approximate procedures are valid. in this approximation

the behavior of i2(k) as a function of k is shown in fig. 2.

the quantity i3(k)

in the case of i3(k) we obtain

i3(k) =

c 4
1

420k4(cid:20)(1  k2)(2 + 111k2  297k4  44k6)k
+ (2  112k2 + 234k4 + 428k6  88k8)e(cid:21)

for k = 1 the value is given in ref. []:

i3(k = 1) =

87
140  0.621429.

11

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

since this is positive, it would help towards a second order transition. with these results

one can show that i3(k) has the correct k = 1 limit. the behavior of i3(k) as a function of

k is shown in fig.3.

proceeding as in the other cases the nal result is found to be

the quantity i4(k)

i4(k) =

3c 4
1

315k4(cid:20)  (1  k2)(10  21k2 + 48k4  5k6)k
+ (10  26k2 + 96k4  26k6 + 10k8)e(cid:21).

at k = 1 this is

i4(k = 1) =

12
35  0.342857

(41)

(42)

which also supports a tendency towards a second order transition. one can show that

i4(k = 1) has the correct k = 1 limit. the behavior of i4(k) as a function of k is shown in

fig.4.

v. summary and conclusions

summarising the above results in the limit k  1, we obtain

(43)

thus the transition for k = 1 is of rst order. one may note that roughly i2(k = 1) 
i1(k = 1)/10, which is roughly due to a factor 12 in gv,2(k = 1, x). the corresponding

plot of action s versus 1/t is shown in fig.5. putting all our results together we see that as

we go to smaller values of k the tendency away from second order behavior is even enhanced,

i.e. the transition becomes even more of rst order.

since cn(x) is the zero mode of hv, the second term on the left hand side of this equation is

zero. after integrating the right hand side of eq.(a.4) we obtain

it is now necessary to determine a and r. since we work with partially antiperiodic

boundary conditions, we require

q(x + 2k) = q(x).

(a.9)

using also e(x + 2k) = 2e + e(x), one can show that

r =

(1  k2)(cid:20)(1 + 3k2)e  (1  k2)(1 + k2)k(cid:21)

4k2(cid:20)e  (1  k2)k(cid:21)

.

(a.10)

the expression can also be derived from the denition of r in eq.(a.6). in order to determine

a we recall that cn(x) is simply the zero mode term. since, obviously, q(x) does not have a

zero mode component, we need the condition

z k

k

dxcn(x)q(x) = 0

from which we conclude that a = 0.
