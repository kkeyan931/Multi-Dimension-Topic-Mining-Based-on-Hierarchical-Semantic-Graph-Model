we nd the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor in the cft cor-
responding to a moving black hole in ads. boosting the black hole to the speed of
light, keeping the total energy xed, yields a gravitational shock wave in ads. the
analogous procedure on the eld theory side leads to light cone states, i.e., states
with energy-momentum tensor localized on the light cone. the correspondence be-
tween the gravitational shock wave and these light cone states provides a useful tool
for testing causality. we show, in several examples, how the cft reproduces the
causal relations in ads.

1 introduction

most of the recent investigations of the correspondence between string theory in anti-de

sitter (ads) space and conformal eld theory (cft) [1] have focused on the euclidean

regime. lorentzian processes have just begun to be studied [2, 3]. we will be concerned

with the question of how some basic causal relations in ads are reproduced in the confor-

mal eld theory. in the process of answering this question, we are led to a new description

of black holes in terms of the cft, and an interesting connection between gravitational

shock waves in ads and novel states of the cft which are localized on the light cone.

as an example of the type of situation we wish to analyze, consider two massless

particles which come from innity in ads from the same direction, but at dierent times.

it is clear that the later particle cannot inuence the earlier one since it is entirely to its

future. however, in the cft, the scale-radius duality [4] suggests that a single massless

particle that comes in from innity should be described by a localized excitation that

expands outward [3]. so two massless particles should be described by two excitations,

but since the particles start at the same position at dierent times, the second excitation

lies inside the light cone of the rst. it is certainly not obvious why the presence of the

second excitation cannot inuence the further evolution of the rst.

as a second example, suppose we consider two massless particles that come in at the

same time, but from dierent directions. these particles should be described by two

localized excitations in the cft which start at dierent points in space at the same time.

if the excitations are separated by a distance c, it is clear from the cft that interactions

between them cannot occur before a time t = c/2, and are very likely thereafter. is there

an analogous statement on the ads side? at rst sight this seems unlikely since the two

massless particles need not intersect, and even if they do, it is typically at a much later

time.

we will resolve these puzzles below, and show that there is perfect agreement between

the answers one obtains in the cft and ads. the rst step is to realize that one must

take into account the gravitational backreaction of the massless particles. for zero cos-

mological constant, the gravitational backreaction is given by the aichelburg-sexl metric

[5] and describes a gravitational shock wave. this solution can be obtained by boosting
the schwarzschild metric with mass m and taking the limit as m  0, v  1 keeping the
total energy xed. for negative cosmological constant, one can do exactly the same thing

1

starting with the schwarzschild anti-de sitter metric. this was rst done in four dimen-

sions in [6] and is generalized to d dimensions below. it is known that the aichelburg-sexl

metric does not receive any  corrections [7, 8]. we will argue that this is also true for

the gravitational shock wave in ads.

to nd the cft dual of this gravitational shock wave, we start in section 2 by giving

the eld theory description of the schwarzschild ads black hole. since only the ads

metric is excited on the supergravity side, the only nonzero expectation value in the cft

is the energy-momentum tensor. it turns out that the symmetries uniquely determine

< t >. this is straightforward when the cft is dened on a sphere (cross time), but

to describe the boosted black hole, it is more convenient to work on minkowski space. so

we nd the form of < t > in this case also.

in section 3, we perform the boost and construct the gravitational shock wave in ads.

using the fact that on the cft side the boosting corresponds to a minkowski dilation,

we nd the expectation value of t in the cft states which are associated with the

gravitational shock wave. the result is an energy-momentum tensor which takes the form

of null dust conned to the light cone. we will refer to these states as light cone states.

in section 4 we use the correspondence between the gravitational shock wave and

these light cone states to show how the cft reproduces some basic causal relations in

ads. in particular, we resolve the two puzzles mentioned above. the argument that the

gravitational shock wave does not receive  corrections is given in section 5. section

6 contains a discussion of some extensions of our results, including the possibility of

describing the formation of a black hole from the collision of two null particles in terms

of the cft.

the gravitational shock wave solutions in adsd that we construct in section 3 might

have other implications (which will not be explored here). for example, it may be used

to calculate the amplitude for graviton exchange between two massless particles in ads

(in minkowski space this was done in [9]) which is essential for the four point functions

[10]. also the shock wave solution in ads7 can be dimensionally reduced to construct the

type iia solution of d0-branes which are localized on d4-branes in the longitudinal and

radial directions and are smeared along the angular directions. these solutions might be

useful to study the (0, 2) theory living on m5-branes using the dlcq approach [11, 12].

2 cft description of black holes

although most of our discussion applies equally well to ads in various dimensions, to
be specic, we will concentrate on the case of ads5  s5. string theory on this space
is believed to be described by the n = 4 super yang-mills (sym) theory [1]. since the
metric on s5, and the self dual ve form will remain unchanged, we will concentrate below

on the metric on ads5.

we wish to nd the eld theory description of the schwarzschild ads black hole

solution:

ds2 =  1 +

r2
r2 

8gm

3r2 ! dt2 + 1 +

r2
r2 

8gm

3r2 !1

dr2 + r2d2
3,

(2.1)

where r = (4gsn)1/4ls is the ads radius and g is the ve dimensional newtons con-

stant. for nite n, the black hole will hawking radiate and the exact description of

the system is beyond our current abilities.
in the large n limit (for xed gsn), loop
corrections are suppressed and the black hole becomes classical. since g  r3/n 2, to
have a nite backreaction in the large n limit, m must be of the order n 2. of course,

we are used to classical black holes having nite mass. but this mass is in units where

g = 1. since g goes to zero in units of the ads radius in the classical limit, we need
m to diverge. this implies that the corresponding eld theory energies are of order n 2.

note that this is typical for near-extremal d-branes as well. that is, the energy above
extremality of a near-extremal d-branes with nite horizon radius is proportional to n 2

[13, 14].

on the eld theory side, we would like to characterize the states associated with

classical black holes by the expectation value of certain operators. since the solution

(2.1) excites only the ads metric, we conclude, using the arguments of [15, 16, 17], that

the only non-vanishing expectation value is of the energy-momentum tensor. we claim

that in this case, the symmetries determine completely the form of this expectation value.

this is the eld theory analog of the classical statement black holes have no hair.

the ads schwarzschild solution (2.1) breaks the so(4, 2) isometry of ads to so(4)
so(2). this can be seen explicitly by relating the above coordinates to the representation

of ads as the surface

 t 2

1  t 2

2 + x 2

i = r2,

i = 1, ..., 4,

(2.2)

3

embedded in a six dimensional at space with signature (2, 4). in this representation

t1 = (r2 + r2)1/2 sin(t/r), t2 = (r2 + r2)1/2 cos(t/r),

(2.3)

and the xi are related to the spherical coordinates in the usual way. the so(2) rotation
in the t1, t2 plane is simply translation in the t direction. the so(4) isometries are
rotations in the xi, xj planes.

the sym background associated with the black hole should have the same unbroken
symmetries. in terms of the sym theory on s3  r, this implies that the expectation
value of t must be static and homogeneous.3 since t must also be tracefree, this
uniquely xes the energy-momentum tensor to be

< t >= tt +

1
3

h ,

(2.4)

where t is a unit vector in the time direction, h is the metric on s3 with radius r,
and  = m/22r3, is the mass density. this is not surprising for large gm, since large

black holes are described by sym states which are approximately thermal. however, the
symmetries require that (2.4) is also valid for small gm. 4

to describe boosted black holes, it is convenient to reexpress this energy-momentum

tensor in terms of the theory on minkowski space. the answer is not simply (2.4) with h
denoting the at metric on r3. that would correspond to the near extremal three-brane

geometry which has translational symmetry. we want to describe the static, spherically
symmetric black hole in terms of the theory on r3,1. there are two ways to do this.
the rst is to rewrite the unbroken so(2)  so(4) symmetries in terms of conformal
symmetries of minkowski space, and look for an energy-momentum tensor invariant under

these symmetries. this can be done by writing ads in the form

ds2 =

u 22

r2 (cid:16)dt2 + dx2

i(cid:17) +

r2du 2

u 2

,

(2.5)

where these coordinates are related to the embedding coordinates (2.2) via

u =

(x1  t1)



,

t =

t2r
u ,

xi =

xi+1r

u

,

i = 1, 2, 3.

(2.6)

space below.

3we use a tilde for the energy-momentum tensor on s 3r to distinguish it from the one on minkowski
4small black holes are known to be unstable to localizing on the s 5 [18], but if large n sym is
really equivalent to supergravity, it should describe all solutions, even unstable ones. the shock wave we
construct in the next section will be stable.

4

the so(3) subgroup of so(4) implies that the sym background is spherically symmet-

ric. the remaining three generators of so(4) and the generator of so(2) are linear

combinations of translations and special conformal transformations.

an easier way to proceed is to conformally map minkowski space into s3  r and use
this to pull back the energy-momentum tensor (2.4). the required conformal factor can
be derived by noticing that the metric on s3  r is obtained by rescaling ads in global
coordinates by r2/r2 and taking the limit r  , while the metric on r3,1 is obtained by
rescaling ads in coordinates (2.5) by r2/u 22 and taking u  . so the two boundary
metrics are related by the conformal factor:

2 = lim
u 

u 22
r2 =

4r4

(r2 + v2)(r2 + u2)

,

(2.7)

where we have written r in terms of (u, t, xi) and set u = t  r, v = t + r, with r2 =
1 + x2
x2

3. in other words, if we start with the minkowski metric

2 + x2

ds2 = dudv +

(v  u)2

4

d2
2,

(2.8)

and make the conformal transformation g = 2 (with  given by (2.7)), we obtain

where

ds2 = 4r2d ud v + r2 sin2( v  u )d2
2,

u = r tan u ,

v = r tan v .

dening v = 1

2( t

r + ) and u = 1

2( t

r  ) gives

ds2 = dt2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2
2),

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

which is just the metric on s3  r.

we now use the following fact (see, e.g., [19]): if an energy-momentum tensor t is
conserved and traceless with respect to a metric g, then t is conserved and traceless
with respect to g = 2g provided

t = 2 t.

(2.12)

using the conformal transformation (2.7), the coordinate change (2.10), and the known
form of < t > (2.4), we obtain the following expectation value for the energy-momentum

where i and j denote the orthonormal components on the two sphere.

small black holes should approximately follow timelike geodesics. consider the family

of geodesics given (in the metric (2.5)) by

(t2 + r2)u 22 = r4.

(2.14)

the parameter r labels dierent geodesics, and determines the maximum value of u

along the curve. the geodesic which stays at the origin r = 0 in the global coordinates

(2.3) corresponds to r = r. these geodesics are all related by a boost in the t1, x1

plane.
it follows from (2.6) that such a boost corresponds to a dilation in minkowski
space. the boost which increases the maximum value of u by e, decreases distances
in r3,1 by e. the energy-momentum tensor of the boosted black hole can thus be
obtained by simply rescaling the dimensionful constants m and r. setting e = me and
r = re, we obtain

< tuu >=

< tvv >=

figure 1: the uv/ir relation at work: (a) on the supergravity side a black hole is
moving along a radial geodesic in ads with maximal radial direction  1/r. (b) on
the sym side, the energy of the sym state associated with the black hole is concentrated
around the light cone with minimal size of r.

let us describe the prole of the expectation values (2.15). the energy-momentum

tensor is concentrated near the light cone u = 0 or v = 0 with a width of order r. so for
|t|  r the energy density extends over distances of the order of t while for |t|  r the
energy density is spread over distances of the order r (see g. 1). this is in agreement
with the uv/ir relation [4] since for |t|  r, eq. (2.14) implies that u  r2/t while
for |t|  r we get u  r2/r (see g. 1).

3 ads shock wave solution and light cone states

having obtained the sym description of the schwarzschild ads black hole, we now pro-

ceed to construct the analog of the aichelburg-sexl metric [5] describing a gravitational

shock wave. on the supergravity side, this solution can be obtained in two ways. one

approach is to boost the ads black hole to the speed of light keeping the total energy

xed. alternatively, one can obtain this solution using the method described in [20], which

consists of appropriately gluing together two pieces of ads spacetime along a null plane.

using these approaches, the ads shock wave metric was found in four dimensions in [6]

and further studied in [21]. below, we reexpress this solution in new coordinates which

7

are more convenient for our purposes, and generalize it to higher dimensions. we then

nd the sym description of this solution by applying the minkowski dilation which is the
analog of the ads boost. to simplify the equations, in this section, we set r2 =  = 1.

to construct the gravitational shock wave we nd it useful to work with the coordinate

system

y0 =

t1

1 + t2

,

yi =

xi

1 + t2

.

in these coordinates, the adsd metric takes the form

ds2

0 =

4dydy

(1  yy)2 ,

(3.1)

(3.2)

where  is the usual d dimensional minkowski metric. the physical spacetime cor-
responds to the region yy < 1 and the boundary at innity is yy = 1. this

clearly shows that adsd is conformal to the region of d dimensional minkowski space lying
inside a timelike hyperboloid. (this should not be confused with the d  1 dimensional
minkowski space of the eld theory.) these coordinates do not cover the entire spacetime,

but only the shaded region shown in fig. 2a. the advantage of this coordinate system is

that the metric is manifestly lorentz invariant, though not static. this makes the form

of the ads shock wave clearer knowing the shock wave solution in minkowski space.

we would like to nd the metric in the presence of a massless particle which moves

along the null geodesic y0 + y1 = 0. by analogy with the solution for zero cosmological

constant, we try a metric of the form

where

ds2 = ds2

0 +

p (y+)f ()dy2
+
(1 + y+y  2)

,

y = y0  y1,

y+ = y0 + y1,

2 =

xi=2

(3.3)

(3.4)

y2
i .

the reason for the factor 1 + y+y  2 in the dominator is that it simplies the equation
for f . substituting (3.3) into einsteins equation r = (d  1)g yields the following
linear equation for f :

d2f  4(d  2)f = 0,

(3.5)

where d2 is the laplacian on the transverse surface of constant y and y+ = 0 which is
just d  2 dimensional hyperbolic space with metric

figure 2: regions of adsd covered by dierent coordinates: the coordinates (3.1) cover
the shaded region in (a). while the coordinates (2.6) cover the shaded region in (b). the
matching between the coordinates is such that the line u = 0, t =  in (b) is the same
as y = 0 in (a).

to describe the eld of a massless particle in ads, one should add a delta function source

to the right hand side of (3.5). near  = 0 the cosmological constant is negligible and the

solution will resemble the aichelburg-sexl metric.

the fact that f satises a linear equation implies that, like in minkowski space, two

parallel massless particles do not interact. that is, a massless particle moving along the
geodesics y+ = 0, yi = 0, for i 6= 1 will not interact with a massless particle moving along,
say, y+ = 0, y2 = const., yi = 0 for i 6= 1, 2.

when the cosmological constant is zero, the gravitational shock wave solution preserves

half the supersymmetry [22]. we believe that the same is true for negative cosmological

constant, although we have not yet checked this. the ability to superpose solutions is

strong evidence for this.

we now turn to the sym description of this gravitational shock wave. to relate string
theory in ads to sym on rd1 it is convenient to use the (u, t, xi) coordinates (2.6). the

9

relation between these coordinates and y (3.1) is

t = 
so the null geodesic y+ = 0,  = 0 is given by

1 + yy+  2 ,

u = 

2y

u = 1/t,

xi = 0,

i.

,

xi = 

yi+1
y

.

(3.7)

(3.8)

we see that at t = 0 the particle is located at the boundary and it falls towards u = 0 at
t = .

in the previous section we found the sym description of a particle (small black hole)

which follows the geodesic (2.14). the geodesic (3.8) is obtained from (2.14) by taking
the limit r  0. (recall that we have set r2 = .) we want to take this limit keeping
the energy xed. therefore, the eld theory energy-momentum tensor associated with
the null particle is obtained from (2.15) by taking the limit r  0 keeping e xed. it is
easy to check that the total eld theory energy, e = r d3x < t00 >, does not depend on
r, so the limit is straightforward. it is clear that for u, v 6= 0, limr0 < t >= 0. so
the energy-momentum tensor is a delta-function supported the light cone, u = 0 or v = 0.

furthermore, on the future light cone, u = 0, the only nonzero component is < tuu >.

similarly, on the past light cone, v = 0, the only nonzero component is < tvv >. this
implies that the energy-momentum tensor takes the form of null dust: < t > ll
where l is a null vector tangent to the light cone. since < t > is nonzero only on the

light cone, we will refer to these states as light cone states.

we now review a eld theory argument due to coleman and smarr [23] that supports

our result that the energy-momentum tensor is localized on the light cone. consider any

classical eld theory whose energy-momentum tensor satises

t00  0,
t  = 0,

t 
 = 0.

(3.9)

from the moment of inertia i(t) = r d3x r2 t00, one can dene the average size of a state

at a given time by

r(t)2 = i(t)/e,

where e = z d3x t00.

using eqs. (3.9,3.10) one nds that d2r2/dt2 = 2 which implies that

r2 = t2 + r2,

10

(3.10)

(3.11)

where r is the minimum average size (which we assume occurs at t = 0). this means

that the initial conguration expands very rapidly, with its average size always larger
than a sphere of light emitted at the origin at t = 0. in the limit r  0, the initial
conguration becomes localized at a point. causality then requires that the elds vanish
outside the light cone. since r2 = t2, the energy density must be localized on the light

cone.

the above argument was intended for a classical eld theory. however the second two

conditions of (3.9) are satised by the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor in

any conformal eld theory. furthermore, even though the rst condition may be violated,

as long as the total energy remains positive, we can still apply the argument. this is

because a negative energy density will only decrease the average size r, but the conclusion
that r  t will still hold. thus one can also apply this argument in the quantum theory.
even though the state is localized to a point at t = 0, there is no contradiction with the

uncertainty principle since it has essentially innite energy: as discussed in the beginning

of section 2, keeping a nite backreaction on the supergravity side in the classical limit
n   requires that e  n 2.

these light cone states are probably also supersymmetric. one usually thinks that

supersymmetric states must be static, since the square of the supersymmetry generator is

usually a time translation. the light cone states are clearly not static, but in a supercon-

formal theory, one has the possibility that the supersymmetry generator will square to a

special conformal transformation (see, e.g., [24]). one can verify that the light cone states

are invariant under the special conformal transformations by translating the symmetries

of the null geodesic (3.8) to the eld theory.

4 tests of causality

we now apply the correspondence between the gravitational shock waves and the light

cone states to test whether sym reproduces the causal relations in ads. to begin,

consider two massless particles in ads which come in from innity from the same direction,

but at dierent times. in other words, they follow the null geodesics y+ = 0,  = 0 and

y+ = a > 0,  = 0. the rst particle produces a gravitational eld described by the

shock wave metric (3.3). the second particle produces an analogous shock wave solution
obtained from (3.3) by the coordinate change y+  y+ a. since the nontrivial curvature

11

(a)

(b)

figure 3: on the supergravity side (a) we have two shock waves which do not interact.
on the sym side (b) the states associated with these shock waves evolve on light cones
which do not cross.

in the rst shock wave is concentrated on the null plane y+ = 0, and in the second is

concentrated on y+ = a, we can clearly combine them into a single solution describing both

particles. since the shock waves do not intersect, there is no interaction between these

particles. in the sym theory, we have seen that the corresponding states are localized on

the light cone, so once again, they do not interact (see g. 3).

note that the absence of interactions is a result of having massless particles. suppose

we consider, following [3], two strings which wind around the x3 direction and come in

from innity from the same point (in the x1 and x2 directions) at dierent times. on

the supergravity side, the backreaction of such strings is not conned to null surfaces and

hence they will interact. on the eld theory side, the wound strings are represented by

ux tubes which expand in time. the expansion in this case is not conned to the light

cone and hence the ux tubes will also interact.

another case in which we know that there are no interactions on the supergravity side

is of parallel massless particles. to be specic we consider two massless particles following

the geodesics

(4.2)

where a = 1+2

12 and b = 2

12 . notice that at the boundary (u = ), ti = 0 = tii and
xii = 0 = xiii. in other words, even though the proper distance between the two particles
is constant in ads (as follows from (3.2)) their separation in (t, xi) goes to zero since u 2

blows up at the boundary. thus from the sym point of view, these two particles are

described by states localized on the same light cone. it is certainly not obvious why they

do not interact. although we do not have a complete answer to this puzzle, this result
can be made plausible as follows. since a2  b2 = 1, the sym states associated with
the two particles are related to each other via a boost in the (t, x1) plane. (note that

the conclusion of the previous section that the states evolve on the light cone is invariant

under the boost.) classically, two massless particles starting from the same point but in

dierent directions will not interact since they are not causally connected. the fact that

the energy-momentum tensor of the light cone states takes the form of null dust strongly

supports the idea that these states will not interact. if the light cone states are indeed

supersymmetric and analogous to bps states, this would provide another argument for

the absence of interactions.

next we consider a typical case in which there are interactions. we wish to compare

the minimum time for interactions to occur in both the sym and supergravity description.

consider two massless particles which come in from innity at the same time, but from

dierent directions in space. they are described by the null geodesics

clearly, these states will start to interact at a time t = c/2 when the light cones intersect

figure 4:
(a) the arrows indicate the trajectories of the massless particles. the dashed
lines indicate the shock wave of the particle whose trajectory initiates at x1 = c. the
shock wave of the other particle coincides (in the gure) with its trajectory. the shock
waves cross each other at t = c/2 which is in agreement with sym (b).

for any nite t. (the particles do intersect at u = 0, but this corresponds to innite t.)

as we have discussed, the resolution is that the sym state describes not only the motion

of the particle but its gravitational back-reaction (that is, the shock wave) as well. we

need to nd, therefore, when the shock waves cross each other.

the exact solution for two intersecting shock waves is not known completely5, but for-

tunately, it is not needed to answer this question. the complicated part of the solution lies

to the future of the intersection of the shock waves. elsewhere, the solution is simply ads
with two approaching waves. we want to compute the time (in the (u, t, xi) coordinates

associated with the minkowski time in the eld theory) for the shock waves to meet. how-
ever it is easier to describe the approaching shock waves in y coordinates, since they lie
along planes in these coordinates. so we will rst use the y coordinates, and then trans-

late back using (3.7). we have seen that the solution for the gravitational eld induced

by particle (i) in (4.3) has a shock along the plane y0 + y1 = 0. the region that overlaps
the (u, t, xi) coordinates with u > 0 has  < y0 < 0. particle (ii) follows the curve
y+ = c2y, y2 = cy, yi = 0 for i 6= 1, 2. this implies y2 = 2cy1/(1  c2) so this world-
line can be obtained from the original one (satisfying y2 = 0) by a rotation in the y1, y2

plane. so the plane of its shock wave will be similarly rotated: y0 + cos  y1 + sin  y2 = 0
where cos  = 1c2
1+c2 . therefore, the two shock waves will cross each-other and interact at

   y0  0,

y1 = y0,

y2 = cy0,

and hence the eld theory time of intersection is

t  

1 + y2

0c2

4y0  c/2,

(4.5)

(4.6)

which is in a precise agreement with the sym results.

this agreement actually reects a deep connection between the causal structure of

ads and its boundary. the conformally completed ads spacetime resembles a solid

cylinder. but there is a crucial dierence between the causal structure of this spacetime

and a solid (timelike) cylinder in minkowski spacetime. the intersection of a null plane in

minkowski spacetime and a timelike cylinder is a spacelike curve. similarly, a null curve

which stays on the boundary of the cylinder is not a null geodesic, and reaches the other

side at a later time than a null geodesic which passes through the interior. in ads this

is not the case. a null geodesic which starts on the boundary stays on the boundary. a

null plane in the interior intersects the boundary at innity in a null surface which is, in
fact, the future light cone6 of a point p. in fact, the null plane is simply part of the future

light cone of p consisting of those null geodesics which enter the interior.

this explains the agreement we just found. the nontrivial curvature in the gravita-

tional shock wave lies on a null plane which is part of the future light cone of a point on

the boundary at innity. so the intersection of two shock waves occurs rst where their

light cones intersect, which is on the boundary. indeed, the time t = c/2 corresponds to
y0 = 1/c in (4.6) which implies u =  using (4.5) and (3.7). hence the time is the
same as if one rst restricts the light cones to the boundary and then asks when they

intersect (which is just the eld theory answer). note that this argument is about the

relation between the causal structure in the interior and on the boundary. the nontrivial

curvature in the shock wave metric goes to zero for large distance from the source, so

there is no extra curvature on the boundary light cone. however, for any t > c/2 the

shock waves will intersect in the interior resulting in gravitational interactions.

6we could have said past light cone. since all null geodesics from a point p on the boundary focus
on the other side of the s 3 at the same point q, the future light cone of p is the same as the past light
cone of q.

5  corrections

in this section we show that there are no  corrections to the ads shock wave solution.

the fact that the solution probably breaks 1/2 of the supersymmetries does not necessarily

imply that there are no  corrections, since usually higher order corrections do modify

bps solutions (though they do not modify the relation between the charges and the

energy). however, there are several examples when higher order terms do not modify

the solution at all. our argument for the ads shock wave solution will be based on two
such examples. the rst is the ads5  s5 metric which has recently been shown to be
an exact solution [26]. the second is the shock wave solution in minkowski space.7 in [7]

it was shown that this background is a solution of the -model equation of motion to all

orders in perturbation theory. a geometrical derivation of this result, which rests on the

fact that the curvature is null, was given in [8]. the result of [7] cannot be generalized

to ads since we do not know how to describe string theory with a rr-background by a

-model. however, the geometrical approach of [8] can be generalized to ads to show,

together with the result of [26], that higher order (local) corrections will not modify the

solution.

to see that there are no  corrections, let us write the ads shock wave solution (3.3)

in the form

g = g0

 + f ll

(5.1)

where g0

 is the ads metric and l = y+. then ll = 0 and the riemann curvature

takes the form

,

 + r1

r = r0
r0
 = (gg  gg),
r1
 = l[k][l],

(5.2)

r0

 is the usual ads curvature, and k is a symmetric tensor satisfying kl = 0.
the  corrections are derived from terms in the action involving higher powers and

derivatives of the curvature. consider rst a scalar constructed just from powers of the
curvature. it is clear that r1

 cannot contribute since the null vectors must contract
7 another example, which is not related to our discussion, is of the sym solution associated with of
an electric charge, which is realized in string theory as a string attached to the d-brane. in [27] it was
shown that the dbi corrections to sym do not modify the solution.

16

either on the metric, on k, or on themselves, and in all cases, the result is zero. terms

involving covariant derivatives of the curvature will also not contribute since the covariant
derivative of r0
 is zero and one can show that l = v(l) for some vector v which
is orthogonal to l. thus one cannot get rid of the factors of l in r1
 by taking
its covariant derivative. since covariant derivatives of k are also orthogonal to l, all
contractions of l will again vanish. thus the only possible  correction terms come from
r0

. but these should be identical to the  corrections of ads itself which have been
shown to vanish [26]. we conclude, therefore, that there are no  corrections to the ads

shock wave solution.

6 discussion

we have found the description of a static spherically symmetric black hole in ads in

terms of the sym theory on minkowski space. by boosting the black hole to the speed of

light keeping the total energy xed, one obtains a gravitational shock wave in ads. we

have seen that the analogous procedure on the sym side yields light cone states  states

whose energy-momentum tensor is localized on the light cone. using the duality between

gravitational shock waves and light cone states, we have shown how the sym reproduces

some basic causal properties of ads.

there are many open questions. in addition to the obvious one of testing other aspects

of causality in ads, one can ask if this analysis extends to the nonconformal dualities

associated with other d-branes [28].

it should be possible to introduce gravitational

shock waves in any supergravity background. are there analogs of the light cone states

in the corresponding eld theories?

one can imagine other applications of the duality between shock waves in ads and

light cone states. for example, the collision of two gravitational shock waves should

produce a black hole. since we know the sym description of both the shock waves and

the black hole, can one see this process in the sym theory? in the example given in (4.3),

the particles did not collide until an innite eld theory time, so one could never see the

formation of a black hole in this case. however, one can consider other null geodesics

which collide at nite time, such as

i)

t = 1 + 2/u, x1 = /u,

xi = 0 for

i > 1,

17

ii)

t = 1 + 2/u, x1 = /u + c,

xi = 0 for

i > 1,

(6.1)

where c > 0,  > 0. (the case  = 0 corresponds to (4.3).) these geodesics intersect in a

time

1 + 2

2

.

t = c

(6.2)

on the sym side the two particles are described by two states evolving on the light

cones (4.4). these light cones always intersect after a time c/2 independent of . so the

formation of a black hole is not directly related to this intersection. it seems to depend on

concentrating the energy in the sym. for  = 0 the energy density on each light cones is

spherically symmetric before they intersect. the eect of  > 0 is to boost the light cone

states toward each other, and hence concentrate the energy in the intersection region.

one might wonder how the energy-momentum tensor could ever evolve into the black

hole form (2.15) which is nonzero everywhere, when causality requires that it be zero

outside the future of the two light cones (4.4). the answer is simply that the collision of

shock waves in ads will take a long time to settle down to a static black hole. it is easy

to see that this will not occur in a nite eld theory time t. for large , one should be

able to see the energy-momentum tensor start to approach the form (2.15) at late times.

it may be possible to make more progress on this question by considering the special

case of ads3. one unusual feature of this case is that since the eld equations require the

solution to be locally ads3 away from the source, there is no gravitational shock wave

solution. the solution describing a null particle in ads3 just has a conical singularity

along a null geodesic [29]. it is not clear if this should be described by a 2d analog of

the light cone states, which would have support on two null curves. one advantage of

the low dimensions is that it is possible to nd an exact supergravity solution describing

the formation of a black hole from the collision of two null particles [29]. it would be

interesting to nd the cft description of this process.
