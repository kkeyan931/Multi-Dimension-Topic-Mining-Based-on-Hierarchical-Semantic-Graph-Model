abstract

momentum space ward identities are derived for the amputated n-point
greens functions in 3 + 1 dimensional non-relativistic conformal eld the-
ory. for n = 4 and 6 the implications for scattering amplitudes (i.e. on-shell
amputated greens functions) are considered. any scale invariant 2-to-2 scat-
tering amplitude is also conformally invariant. however, conformal invariance
imposes constraints on o-shell greens functions and the three particle scat-
tering amplitude which are not automatically satised if they are scale in-
variant. as an explicit example of a conformally invariant theory we consider
non-relativistic particles in the innite scattering length limit.

poincare invariant theories that are scale invariant usually have a larger symmetry group
called the conformal group1. a similar phenomena happens for 3+1 dimensional non-

relativistic systems. these are invariant under the extended galilean group, which con-

sists of 10 generators: translations (4), rotations (3), and galilean boosts (3). the largest

space-time symmetry group of the free schrodinger equation is called the schrodinger or non-

relativistic conformal group [2]. this group has two additional generators corresponding to

a scale transformation, and a one-dimensional special conformal transformation, sometimes

called an expansion. the innitesimal galilean boost, scale and conformal transforma-

tions are

boosts:

scale:

conformal:

~x  = ~x + ~v t ,

t = t ,

~x  = ~x + s~x ,
t = t + 2st ,
~x  = ~x  ct~x , t = t  ct2 ,

(1)

where ~v, s and c are the corresponding innitesimal parameters. (the nite scale transfor-
mation is ~x  = es ~x, t = e2s t, and the nite conformal transformation is ~x  = ~x/(1 + ct),

1/t = 1/t + c.)

in this letter we explore the implications of non-relativistic conformal invariance for 3 + 1

dimensional physical systems. ward identities are derived for the amputated momentum

space greens functions. particular attention is paid to scattering amplitudes, which are am-

putated on-shell momentum space greens functions. while the o-shell greens functions

can be changed by eld redenitions, the scattering amplitudes are physical quantities and

are therefore unchanged. we nd that any 2-to-2 (identical particle) scattering amplitude

that satises the scale ward identity automatically satises the conformal ward identity.

however, this is not the case for the corresponding o-shell greens function or for the 3-to-3

scattering amplitude. we construct a eld theory that has a four point function which obeys

the scale and conformal ward identities. on-shell it gives s-wave scattering with an innite

scattering length.

the action for a free non-relativistic eld n(~x, t) is

s0 = z dtd3x n (cid:16)it + 2

2m(cid:17)n ,

(2)

1exceptions are known to exist, however, these theories suer from pathologies, such as
non-unitarity. a detailed discussion of scale and conformal invariance in relativistic theories
can be found in ref. [1].

gn(~x, t) = n (~x, t)  n(~x, t) = dg n(~x, t) = ~v  (cid:16)im ~x  t~(cid:17)n(~x, t) .

(3)

the action in eq. (2) is invariant under the innitesimal scale transformation in eq. (1)

now consider adding interactions that preserve these invariances (an explicit example

will be considered later). the position space greens functions for the interacting theory,
g(2n)(~xi, ti) = g(2n)(~x1, t1; . . . ; ~x2n, t2n), are dened by2

g(2n)(~xi, ti) = h | tn n(~x1, t1)    n(~xn, tn)n (~xn+1, tn+1)    n (~x2n, t2n) o|i ,

(6)

where |i is the vacuum of the interacting theory and is assumed to be invariant under the
schrodinger group. under the innitesimal transformations in eqs. (3-5)

where j is 1 for incoming particles (subscripts 1, . . . , n) and 1 for outgoing particles
(subscripts n+1, . . . , 2n). the delta functions in eq. (9) arise due to translational invariance.

using eq. (8) with ~x2n = 0 and t2n = 0 it is straightforward to show that invariance under

galilean boosts, scale transformations, and conformal transformations implies the ward

identities

(18)

the leading term in the eective eld theory for non-relativistic nucleon-nucleon scat-

tering corresponds to a scale invariant theory in the limit that the s-wave scattering lengths

go to innity (see for e.g. ref. [3]). as we will see below, this limit corresponds to a xed

point of the renormalization group. since in nature the s-wave scattering lengths are very

large, it is the unusual scaling of operators at this non-trivial xed point [4] that controls

their importance in this eective eld theory [5,6]. motivated by this we add to eq. (2) the

interaction

s1 = z dtd3x c0 (n t p n)(n t p n) ,

(19)

where n is now a two component spin-1/2 fermion eld and p = i2/2. higher body non-

derivative interaction terms are forbidden by fermi statistics. the interaction in eq. (19)

only mediates spin singlet s-wave nn scattering. the nn scattering amplitude arises from

the sum of bubble feynman diagrams shown in fig. 1. the loop integration associated with

a bubble has a linear ultraviolet divergence and consequently the values of the coecients

5

c0 depend on the subtraction scheme adopted. in minimal subtraction, if p  1/a where
p is the center of mass momentum and a is the scattering length, then successive terms

in the perturbative series represented by fig. 1 get larger and larger. subtraction schemes

have been introduced where each diagram in fig. 1 is of the same order as the sum. one

such scheme is pds [5], which subtracts not only poles at d = 4, but also the poles at

d = 3 (which correspond to linear divergences). another such scheme is the os momentum

subtraction scheme [4,7]. in these schemes the coecients are subtraction point dependent,
c0  c0(). calculating the bubble sum in pds or os gives

the limit a   corresponds to the xed point c0 = 1. at a xed point one expects
the theory to be scale invariant. in fact, it can be easily veried that in the a   limit

q4m(e1 + e2) + (~p1 + ~p2)2  i

satises both the scale and conformal ward identities in eqs. (14) and (18). in the case of
a(4) the conformal ward identity gives non-trivial information about the o-shell amplitude.
for instance the amplitude

a(4) =

8
m

q(~p1  ~p3)2  (~p2  ~p3)2  i

(24)

is scale and galilean invariant but not conformally invariant. the expressions for a(4) in
eqs. (23) and (24) agree on-shell, where ei = ~pi

2/(2m).

the interaction in eq. (19) also induces non-trivial amputated greens functions, a(2n),
for n > 2. (for n = 3 see fig. 2.) it is believed that non-perturbatively the higher point

functions are nite and we speculate that with c0 at its critical xed point the action s0 +s1

denes a non-relativistic conformal eld theory.

we will now derive scale and conformal ward identities for the on-shell amplitudes since

these are the physical quantities of interest. consider the four point function. after imposing

translation invariance it is a function of 12 variables

a(4)(~p1, ~p2, ~p3, e1, e2, e3) .

the ward identity dga(4) = 0 is solved by the function a(4)(~pa, ~pb, u1, u2, u3) where

~pa = ~p1  ~p3 ,

~pb = ~p2  ~p3 ,

ui = mei

(25)

(26)

therefore, using the galilean boost invariance gives three constraints on a(4) leaving 9
variables. for this function the scale and conformal identities are

on-shell the four point function has an additional four constraints u1 = u2 = u3 = 0 and
 = 0, where the last condition follows because u4 = u1 + u2  u3   = 0. the operator

7

ds can be dened consistently on-shell since all derivatives with respect to u1,2,3 and  are
multiplied by coecients which vanish in the on-shell limit.
in taking the on-shell limit
we are assuming that derivatives of a(4) with respect to the o-shell parameters are not
singular. this is true of the explicit example in eq. (23) as long as the momentum of the

nucleons in the center of mass frame is nonzero. finally, from eq. (29) we see that on-shell
a scale invariant a(4) is automatically conformally invariant.

solving dsa(4) = 0, the most general scattering amplitude consistent with schrodinger

group invariance is

a(4)

os =

x + y

f(cid:16)y  x

y + x(cid:17) =

1
2p

f (cos ) ,

(30)

where f is an arbitrary function, and  is the scattering angle in the center of mass frame.

conformal invariance does not restrict the angular dependence of the scattering amplitude.

additional physical criteria can be used to provide further constraints. the condition that

the s-wave scattering length goes to innity corresponds to a ne tuning that produces a

bound state at threshold. assuming that this is the only ne tuning and that the interactions
are short range the threshold behavior of the phase shift in the th partial wave is   p2+1
for  > 0. it is easy to see that the only partial wave obtained from eq. (30) with acceptable
threshold behavior is the s-wave, so f can be replaced by a constant. in the limit a  
the interaction in eq. (19) provides an explicit example of a scale invariant theory which

has this behavior.

in the case of the 3-to-3 scattering amplitude, conformal invariance will provide a new

constraint independent from that of scale invariance. we proceed exactly as in the case of

the 2-to-2 scattering amplitude. after imposing energy and momentum conservation the 6

point function has 20 coordinates

a(6)(~p1, . . . ~p5, e1, . . . , e5) .
using the galilean boost invariance leaves 17 coordinates

a(6)(~p, ~k, ~p , ~k , u1, . . . , u5) ,

amputated greens functions the conformal operator can be dened on-shell because terms

it is possible to express z9 in terms of z1, . . . , z8. for scale invariant

that involve derivatives with respect to the o-shell parameters (ui and ) have coecients

which vanish on-shell.

even after demanding scale invariance the conformal ward identity still imposes a non-

trivial constraint on the amplitude. it is easy to nd examples of boost and scale invariant
functions which do not satisfy dc a(6) = 0. due to the complexity of eq. (37) we have not
attempted to nd its general solution.

the eective eld theory for the strong interactions of nucleons is more complicated

than the toy model given by s0 + s1, because nucleons have isospin degrees of freedom.

with innite spin singlet and spin triplet nn scattering lengths the four point functions

are invariant under the schrodinger group at leading order. for nucleons, the six point point

functions can involve states with total spin 1/2 and 3/2. in the spin 1/2 channel a three

body contact interaction with no derivatives exists and is needed to renormalize the integral

equation for three body scattering [8]. this three body contact operator is expected to

break scale and conformal invariance. in the spin 3/2 channel [9], no three body operator is

needed and this amplitude is expected to respect the constraints from scale and conformal

invariance. explicit verication of this would be interesting.

in this letter we derived ward identities for amputated momentum space greens func-

tions that follow from invariance under the schrodinger group. we also examined implica-

tions of these constraints for 2-to-2 and 3-to-3 on-shell scattering amplitudes. motivated by

recent developments in nuclear theory, we considered a non-relativistic theory in the limit

of innite scattering length and found it gives rise to a four point function which satises

the ward identities which follow from schrodinger invariance.
