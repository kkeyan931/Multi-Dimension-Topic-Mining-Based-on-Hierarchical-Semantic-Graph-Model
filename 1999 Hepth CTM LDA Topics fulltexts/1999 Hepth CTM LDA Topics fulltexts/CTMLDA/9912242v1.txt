abstract

recently a realization of the four-dimensional gravity on a brane in ve-
dimensional spacetime has been discussed. randall and sundrum have shown that
the equation for the longitudinal components of the metric uctuations admit a nor-
malizable zero mode solution, which has been interpreted as the localized gravity
on the brane. we point out that the equation for the transverse components of the
metric uctuations has a solutions, which is not localized on the brane. this indi-
cates that probably the eective theory is unstable or, in other words, actually it is
not four-dimensional but ve-dimensional. perhaps a modication of the proposal
by using matter elds can lead to the trapping of gravity to the brane.

introduction

recently a realization of the four-dimensional gravity on a brane in ve-dimensional space-
time has been discussed [1]-[10]. randall and sundrum [1, 2] have shown that the longitu-
dinal components of the metric uctuations satisfy to the quantum mechanical equation
with the potential, which includes an attractive delta-function. as a result one has a
normalizable zero mode, which has been interpreted as the localized gravity on the brane.
however in order to speak about the localized gravity one has to demonstrate that
not only longitudinal but also the transverse components of the metric are conned to the
brane. in this note we point out that the transverse components of the metric uctuations
satisfy to the equation with the potential, which includes the repulsive delta-function.
there is a solution of this equation but it is not localized and it indicates that there is
unstability or, in other words, that the eective theory actually is not four-dimensional
but ve-dimensional. therefore it seems the original proposal from [1, 2] does not lead to
the realization of the four-dimensional gravity on the brane in ve-dimensional spacetime.
perhaps a modication of this proposal by using matter elds can lead to the trapping of
gravity to the brane.

2 metric perturbation

the action has the form

i =

1

2 z ddxq|g| (r + 2) + ibrane,

the rs solution is [1-3]

ds2 =

m n dxm dxn

(kpi |zi| + 1)2

m, n = 0, . . . , 3 + n,

,

i = 1, . . . , n,

zi = xi+3,

,  = 0, 1, 2, 3,

(1)

(2)

where m n is a minkowski metric. the metric 2 has singularities at zi = 0 for any
i = 1, . . . , n, which correspond to intersecting n+2-branes. their intersection at zi = 0 for
all i = 1, . . . , n is 3-brane, which bears standard model elds and corresponds to observable
4-dimensional universe. the propagation of the longitudinal (, )-components of metric
perturbation in the background (2) was studied in the papers [2, 3]. these perturbations
are bounded in the vicinity of the 4-brane. in this note we consider the perturbation of
the transverse ((i, j) and (i, )) components.

we write the solution in the form [1-3]

g0
m n = h 2m n ,

h = k

|zi| + 1,

xi=1

where

k2 =

(n + 3)(n + 2)

,

and  is the bulk cosmological constant.

let us consider its perturbations, which are parametrized by hm n in the following way

gm n = h 2 (m n + hm n ) = h 2gm n

and x the gauge

hm n m n = 0, kmk hm n = 0.

where d = n + 4 and all objects, which bear tilde are calculated by using the metric gm n ,

gm n = m n  hm n = m n  m khklln ,

we compute all objects up to the rst order in hm n . we obtain

gm n = gm n + (d  2)

m n h  k

m n k h

where

(n hlm + m hln  lhm n ) .

using the gauge conditions (7)

kl = 0

we get

gm n =

where  = m n m n . now by using einstein equations

gm n = gm n + t branes

m n

(13)

(14)

we can identify h-terms with t branes, because they contribute only on the brane sur-
faces, and using (4), (5) we identify the hh-term with gm n . therefore one gets

finally we obtain the wave equation for metric perturbation in the form

3 propagation of metric perturbations

function h does not depend on x.
following form

it allows us to rewrite the equation (16) in the

hij + (d  2)

mn (jhni + ihnj  nhij) = 0,

hi + (d  2)

h + (d  2)

mn (hni + ihn  nhi) = 0,

mn (hn + hn  nh) = 0.

(17)

(18)

(19)

to solve the system one can solve equation (17) to nd hij, then substitute hij into
equation (18) to nd hi and nally substitute hi into equation (19) to nd h.

if hi = 0, then equation (19) coincides with the wave equation derived in [2, 3] for

the longitudinal polarization of the perturbation

   (d  2)

mnn! h = 0.

(20)

this equation can be transformed into the wave equation with attractive delta-function

where h = h (n+2)/2h. there is a bound state, which corresponds to the localized four-
dimensional gravity [2, 3]. the zero-mass state corresponds to h = ch (n+2)/2eipx, pp =
0, so

h = c eipx,

(22)

where c is a constant polarization tensor.

4 non-longitudinal polarization in 5 dimensions

in the simplest case of one extra dimension equations (17)-(19) acquire the following form

  + 3

555! h55 = 0,

h5 + 3

55h55 = 0,

5h

55 (h5 +  h5) = 0.

(23)

(24)

(25)

the equation (23) can be transformed into the wave equation with the repulsive delta-
function

(cid:18) 

2

+ v (+)(z)(cid:19) h55 = 0,

v (+)(z) =

3k2
8h 2 +

(z),

4

(26)

where h = h 3/2h. the zero-mass state corresponds to the solution h = ch 3/2eipx, pp =
0, where c is a constant, so

after the substitution of h55 (27) into equation (24) we have

h55 = ceipx.

h5  3

k sign(z)
k|z| + 1

ipceipx = 0

let us set h5 = ipceipx(z), then one gets

 = 

3 sign(z)
|z| + 1
k

.

the solution of this equation for positive z is

 = 3(cid:18)ln(cid:18)z +

1

k(cid:19)  1(cid:19)(cid:18)z +

1

k(cid:19) + az + b,

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

where a and b are constants of integration. substituting (30) into (25) we obtain

  

3 sign(z)
|z| + 1
k

555! h +

6 sign(z)
|z| + 1
k

pp(z) = 0.

(31)

so, we obtain the solution of the equations for the metric perturbation with non-
longitudinal polarization. the problem is that the perturbation with the transverse com-
ponents h5 is not localized on the brane due to the form of  (30). this indicates
that probably the eective theory is unstable or, in other words, actually it is not four-
dimensional but ve-dimensional. perhaps the coupling with matter elds [4] could lead
to the trapping of gravity to the brane.

we are grateful to i.ya. arefeva for useful discussions.
