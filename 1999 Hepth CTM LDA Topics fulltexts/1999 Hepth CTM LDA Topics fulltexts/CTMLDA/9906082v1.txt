abstract: we present a general review about the n=1 supersymmetric su (nc) yang-mills on the
lattice focusing our attention on the quenched approximation in supersymmetry. finally we analyse
and discuss the recent results obtained at strong coupling and large nc for the mesonic and fermionic
propagators and spectrum.

1. introduction

in this paper we consider the non-perturbative
aspects of the strongly interacting supersymmet-
ric gauge theories. [1]. in particular we concen-
trate our attention on the pure n=1 supersym-
metric yang-mills (sym) theory.

the fundamental question of the supersym-
metry (susy) breaking of the n=1 sym was ad-
dressed in refs.[2], [3]. according to the general
argument of the witten index [2] or the veneziano-
yankielowicz (vy) low energy eective theory [3]
one can conclude that:

 the spontaneous breaking of chiral symme-
try occurs: the gluino condensate hi 6= 0
 the low energy supermultiplet is given by
the scalar, pseudoscalar and fermion colour-
less bound states.

 susy is not broken
 no goldstone boson (or pion) associated with
the chiral symmetry breaking is present, as
the latter is broken by the anomaly.

a primary tool for a direct study of strongly
coupled eld theories is the space-time lattice
regularization.
in qcd the non perturbative

works made in collaboration with a. donini and b.
gavela for quenched supersymmetry and a. gonzalez-
arroyo and c. pena for strong coupling limit

phenomena such as connement, chiral symme-
try breaking and spectra can be studied on the
lattice by using numerical monte carlo simula-
tion in the weak coupling limit. nevertheless,
when the supersymmetric gauge theories are for-
mulated on the lattice, the following problems
arise

 the lattice breaks the poincare group and
so there are no continuum susy algebra
transformations.

 the naive lattice formulation breaks the
balance n0 bosons=n0 fermions due to the
extra poles in the gluino propagator. the
wilson term cures this problem, but gener-
ates a bare mass term for the gluinos which
breaks explicitely both the chiral symmetry
and supersymmetry.

the basic idea to circumvent these problems was
proposed some time ago by curci and veneziano
[4]. they suggested to leave that the lattice reg-
ularization spoil susy and chiral symmetries.
then the ward identities (wi) in the continuum
limit should be recovered by using appropriate
renormalized operators for the susy and chiral
currents [4], such as the case of chiral symmetry
in qcd [5]. the main result is that in the con-
tinuum limit the chiral limit denes the susy
point and viceversa [4].

recently two dierent collaborations [6]-[9]
studied non perturbatively on the lattice the spec-

trum of the n=1 sym theory following the guide
lines of ref. [4]. in ref. [8], because of the lim-
itation deriving from the use of computing re-
sources, the quenched approximation was used
to study the spectrum. this approximation is
implemented by neglecting the internal gluino
loops or in other words by setting to unity the
fermion determinant in the correlation functions
of composite operators. in the sym theory the
quenched approximation badly breaks susy and
it cannot be a good approximation on the basis
of large nc dominance since gluinos are in the
adjoint representation of the colour group. how-
ever the quenched numerical results for the low
energy spectrum show no deviations from the su-
persymmetry expectation within the statistical
errors [8].

in connection with this result, in ref. [10] a
qualitative and quantitative understanding of the
eects of quenching in n=1 sym theory has been
analysed in the framework of low energy eective
theory. the result is that the splitting in the
mass spectrum of the low energy supermultiplet
is connected to the changing of the anomalies
structure induced by quenching.

recently it has been analysed the strong cou-
pling limit of the n=1 sym on the lattice in the
large nc limit [11]. the method used in ref. [11]
is based on the hopping parameter (k) expansion
in terms of random walks which have been re-
summed for any value of the wilson parameter
(r) in the small hopping parameter region. an-
alytical results have been obtained for the prop-
agator and spectra of the mesonic 2-gluino and
fermionic 3-gluino operators in terms of r and
k. moreover the critical lines in k and r space,
where the chiral symmetry and supersymmertry
can be recovered in the continuum limit, have
been analysed for any dimension [11].

the paper is organized as follows.

in the
next section we discuss the weak coupling limit
on the lattice and summarize the approach of
ref.
[4]. in section 3 we present the results on
the susy spectrum induced by the quenched ap-
proximation by means of a low energy eective
lagrangian.
in section 4 we discuss the strong
coupling limit at large nc and give the main re-
sults for the correlation functions and spectra for
the 2-gluino and 3-gluino operators. finally in

the last section we summarize our conclusions.

2. weak coupling limit

the lattice chiral wi can be obtained by apply-
ing the chiral transformations to the n = 1 sym
lattice. the result is given by 1

a = 2m0p + xa

(2.1)

where m0 is the gluino bare mass. the opera-
tor xa comes from the chiral symmetry-breaking
due the lattice spacing and it vanishes in the con-
tinuum limit (a  0) since it is of order o(a).
nevertheless when we take the matrix elements
of eq.(2.1) between external states, the contri-
bution of the operator xa could not vanish in
the continuum limit. indeed xa can induce di-
vergencies of order o(1/a) that compensate the
explicit factor a in xa and spoil the wi in the
continuum limit.

however it is possible to dene a renormal-
ized operator xa whose matrix elements are still
of order o(a) [5],[4]. due to the symmetries of
the action, xa can mix only with the following
operators

xa = xa + (za  1)a  zaa

 zqp p + 2 mp

(2.2)

where p is the lattice transcription of the eld
strength f and p is the dual. finally, by
inserting eq.(2.2) inside eq.(2.1), we obtain the
renormalized chiral wi which has the good con-
tinuum limit [4]

 a = 2(m0  m)z1

p

p + q + o(a)

(2.3)

provided that

a = za(g0)a,
q = zq(g0)p p + za(g0)a

p = zp (g0)p

where the q term reproduces the usual chiral
anomaly. it is important to note that the eq.(2.3)
has the same form as the continuum one provided
that we identify on the lattice the renormalized
gluino mass m as follows [4]

m = (m0  m)z1
p .

(2.4)
1the expression for the chiral currents a and the pseu-
doscalar density p , together with the n=1 super-yang-
mills action on the lattice, can be found in refs. [4], [8]

finally the chiral symmetry on the lattice is re-
covered by tuning m0 to a critical value mcrit

0

mcrit
0  m(mcrit

0

, g0, r) = 0

(2.5)

where the m term depends in general on m0, g0
and r. note that za is of order za = 1 + o(g0)
and in the continuum limit (g0  0) we obtain
za = 1, as expected by the current non renor-
malization theorem.

in the case of susy wi we have an analo-

gous result of eq.(2.1)

s = 2m0 + xs

where now s(x) is the bare susy current on
the lattice and  = 1/2p a
 a where the a is
the gluino eld. the expressions for xs and s
can be found in ref.[4]. the operator xs, which
is of order o(a), spoil the continuum susy wi,
like xa in the case of chiral symmetry.
by applying the same method used for the chiral
wi one obtains the following renormalized susy
wi [4]

 s = 2(m0  m)z1

  + o(a)

where

 = z,
t(x)   p a

(x)a(x)

s = zss + zt t

this result coincides with the corresponding one
in the continuum, provided that the renormalized
gluino mass m is identied with
m = (m0  m)z1

(2.6)



then the relevant conclusion is that in the con-
tinuum limit the chiral limit of eq.(2.4) denes
the susy point and viceversa [4].

the present numerical analysis implement
these guidelines for studing the spectrum of the
n=1 sym with su(2) gauge group. accord-
ing to veneziano-yankielowicz [3], the low-energy
susy supermultiplet is given by the following
colourless composite elds

s(x) = a(x)a(x),
(x) = ga

 (x) a(x)

p (x) = a(x)5a(x),
(2.7)

where the sum on the colours is assumed. as
usual the masses are extracted from the large

3

euclidean-time behaviour of the lattice correla-
tion functions for the corresponding operators in
eq.(2.7).

in ref.

[8] the quenched approximation is
used in which dynamical gluino loops are ne-
glected, or the fermion determinant det(k) is
setted to 1 in the correlation functions.2 in qcd
the quenched approximation is a good one be-
cause the det(k) = o(1/nc) in the large nc
limit. in the present case the gluinos are in the
adjoint representation of the colour group (like
the gluons) and by using naive arguments based
on perturbation theory one should expect that
the quenched approximation badly breaks susy.
3 nevertheless the quenched results of ref.
[8]
show a dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and
a quite degenerate spectrum in low energy super-
multiplet. moreover in ref.[8] the ozi approxi-
mation has been used. in this approximation the
diagrams which contribute to the chiral anomaly
are neglected and by using general arguments [4]
one should expect a massless pseudo-goldstone
boson or pion in the spectrum.

in the next section we will show how to im-
plement the quenching in the fundamental the-
ory. then we will give an estimation of the sys-
tematic error induced by the quenching on the
spectrum, by means of a low energy lagrangian
approach.

3. quenched supersymmetry

in the continuum theory the on-shell action of
the n=1 sym theory is given by

(3.1)
where da
 is the covariant derivative acting on the
gluino eld a. at the classical level this action is
u (1)a invariant, as well as scale invariant. at the
quantum level these symmetries are broken by
the corresponding anomalies and the anomalous
wi are given by
j = c(g)f a

 = c(g)f a

f a, 

 f a



2really in the present case one has the pfaan instead

of det(k) since the gluinos are majorana elds.

3these arguments, based on perturbation theory, do
not apply in the strong coupling limit (see section 4),
where indeed this approximation is exact at large nc

trieste meeting of the tmr network on physics beyond the sm

s = 2c(g) f a

 a

(3.2)

where j and s are the chiral and susy cur-
rents respectivley, 
 the energy momentum ten-
sor, with c(g) = (g)/2g and (g) is the beta
function of n=1 sym. the above two anomalies
and the susy trace anomaly belong to the same
supermultiplet.

the corresponding low energy theory of vy
[3] was obtained by considering the chiral super-
eld s whose components are given by a complex
scalar eld , a dirac fermion  and complex
auxiliary eld m . in terms of the fundamental
elds, they are described by [3]

 susy is unbroken: mass degeneracy m =

m = m = 1

3 .

now we explain how to implement the quench-
ing in the n=1 sym theory [10]. we extend the
method proposed by bernard and golterman [12]
for quenched qcd to the majorana fermions in
the adjoint representation of the colour group.
in order to cancel the fermion determinant, we
introduce a ghost majorana eld a which has
the same quantum numbers as the gluino a,
but wrong (bosonic) spin-statistics. then the
quenched action sq

sy m is given by

sy m = z d4x(cid:26)

where  and  are two free parameters. note
that the request to reproduce the correct anoma-
lies of the fundamental action in eq.(3.1) xes
completely the form of the superpotential. the
spectrum can be easily analysed by looking at
the minimum of the scalar potential (vv y ) in
the exponential representation for the scalar eld
  ei

vv y =

then the following conclusions are drawn [3]

 min(vv y ) is obtained at a non-zero value of
: spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking
occurs.

 the would-be goldstone boson, , is not a
massless eld: the anomaly term in the la-
grangian explicitly breaks the chiral sym-
metry, providing a mass scale for the su-
permultiplet.

note that (due to the wrong statistic and majo-
rana nature) adab
 b = 0 (up to total deriva-
tives), in the same way as a5dab
 b = 0. it
is important to stress that the sq
sy m is no longer
supersymmetric, but it acquires a new u (1 | 1)
symmetry [10]. note that sq
sy m violates unitar-
ity due to the ghost  eld.4

the u (1 | 1) group is a z2 graded lie group
with both bosonic and fermionic generators (the
supersymmetric algebra itself obeys a z2 graded
lie group) [13]. in a more compact form:

sy m =z d4x(cid:26)

sq

 f a + i qa
f a

 qb

r(cid:27)

where q is the doublet qa = (a, a). then
sq
sy m is invariant under chiral u (1 | 1) transfor-
mations, dened as follows:

qr  u qr = exp(cid:26)i
ql  uql

ii

2 (cid:27)qr ,

(3.4)

where uu = i and the i=1,2,3 matrices, which
are the usual pauli matrices (with 0 the unity
matrix), belong to the algebra of u (1 | 1), where
0, 3 and 1, 2 correspond to the bosonic and
fermionic generators respectively. the supertrace
str (invariant under u (1 | 1)) is dened as

str(cid:18) a b

c d(cid:19) = a  d ,

4this is a consequence of the fact that the quenched

approximation violates unitarity

4

where, in general, a, d are complex numbers and
b, c complex grassman numbers. from the trans-
formations in eq.(3.4) we see that four currents
are associated to the u (1 | 1) symmetry, which
are j i

r or in components [10]

from the bosonic statistic of the ghost elds a
it follows that only j 3
 is anomalous. indeed for
the j 0
 anomaly the fermionic-statistic loop ver-
sus the bosonic one cancels exactly, while for the
j 3
 case these are summed up. as for the trace
anomaly it can be shown that the ghost contri-
bution to the trace of the tensor-energy momen-
tum exactly cancel the contribution of the gluino
loop.

in order to generalize the vy eective la-
grangian we introduce new composite elds which
have particular transformation properties under
u (1 | 1). in terms of the gluino and ghost elds
these are given by
  i i,
ic(g)
 =

i = c(g) qa

 f a qa

(3.5)

r  u r

(3.6)

then we look for the most general low energy
eective lagrangian l in terms of the elds in
eq.(3.5). this lagrangian can be decomposed as
follows [10]

l = lkin + lint + lanom

where lkin, lint are invariant under chiral u (1 |
1) and naive scale transformations. the lanom is
not invariant, but it is completely xed by requir-
ing to reproduce the anomalies of the quenched
fundamental theory. moreover the anomalous
u3 (1 | 1) transformations breaks u (1 | 1) as

u (1 | 1)  z4nc  su (1 | 1)

we do not give here the expression for the la-
grangian l that, however, can be found in ref.

5

[10]. we only point out that the coecients of
the u (1 | 1) invariant terms in lkin and lint
are xed by requiring that, in the classical un-
quenched limit (a  0), this lagrangian ap-
proaches continuosly to the corresponding one of
vy, since supersymmetry should be recovered in
this limit. the only term which is non-analytic
in the unquenched limit and is responsible for the
mass splitting is the anomalous term lanom, as
explained in ref. [10].

now we look at the spectrum in the expo-
nential representation  =  exp (iii)   .
note that, in terms of the original eld , we
have 3 =    and 0 =  + , where  is a
pure  ghost condensate and it goes to zero in
the unquenched limit.

the mass spectrum in terms of the original
vy elds is obtained by using the technique ex-
plained in ref. [12] and we nd

m =




m, m = (1 + 1)m

(3.7)

where (g) is the one-loop  function of the
pure yang-mills theory. this spectrum should
be compared with m = m = m in the un-
quenched theory. note that the splitting in the
mass spectrum of eq.(3.7) provides an estimation
of the error induced by the quenched approxima-
tion. now we summarize the main conclusion of
this analysis [10]

 the mass splitting of the vy supermulti-
plet results from the non-analiticity of the
anomaly structure induced by the ghost eld.

 the numerical result obtained in ref.[8] for
the ratio (m/m)lat = 1.1(3) is in fair
agreement with our theoretical expectation
(m/m)th = 11/9 = 1.22 for su (2).

4. strong coupling limit

the lattice strong coupling expansion is a very
powerful analytical probe in order to study the
critical behaviours of lattice gauge theories and
also to test qualitatively their continuum prop-
erties. the strong coupling expansion technique
has been extensively used in pure yang-mills the-
ory and in qcd, often combined also with the
large nc expansion. we recently investigated the

trieste meeting of the tmr network on physics beyond the sm

emidio gabrielli

strong coupling limit at large nc of a n=1 sym
theory and now we present the main results and
conclusions of this work [11].

the usual computational frameworks of strong

coupling expansion can be summarized as follows

 eective actions [14]-[16]: the wilson-dirac
lattice action is considered at large nc and
small  = 1/g2
0. the large nc expansion
can be recognized as a saddle-point expan-
sion of the gauge functional integral, previ-
ously simplied by the   0 limit.

 path resummation [15]-[19]: the fermion
matrix m is inverted by using the stan-
dard hopping parameter expansion, which
expresses the propagator m1 as a sum
over paths on the lattice.

our technique is based on the path resumma-
tion formulas which are valid irrespective of the
representation in which the matter lies and for
general r. moreover we keep r arbitrary since it
allows the possibility of searching for multicriti-
cal points: indeed more freedom in the parame-
ter space is necessary in order to search for the
simultaneous restoration of supersymmetry and
chiral symmetry. now we present the general
formalism.

the susy yang-mills action on the lattice

can be formally written as

s = sg +

1
2

ijmij

,

where sg is the pure gauge part and i is a
grassman variable representing the eld of a ma-
jorana fermion. the matrix m must be antisym-
metric and its form is given by

m = cm, m = i xi



()ij = km n+v () u ab

 (n) (ri  )ab

where u is the gauge link variable, i and c are
the unity and charge conjugation matrix respec-
tively and  is the hopping parameter. with
the indices i and j we simbolically indicate i =
(n, a, a), where n, a and a run on the lattice
points, the indices of the su (nc) adjoint rep-
resentation, and the dirac indices respectively.

6

now we will concentrate upon the gauge invari-
ant operators of the form:

oi(x) = a1

a1(x) . . . ap

ap

(x) (si)a1...ap ca1...ap

i

i

(4.1)
where ca1...ap
is an invariant color tensor and
(si)a1...ap a spin tensor. for p = 2 a basis for si
is the cliord algebra basis in d dimension.
we are interested in computing the following quan-
tities at strong coupling

hoi(x)i, gij (x  y)  hoi(x)oj (y)i

(4.2)

where as usual the h i means the vacuum expec-
tation value.

we will be able to accomplish this goal for
 = 0 and in the large nc limit, and the cor-
rections to the formulas in powers of  and 1
nc
are in principle feasible. when the fermion are
integrated out we obtain

(cid:18)z di(cid:19) exp{
yi
p f (m) exp{

ij mij + jii} =

jijj(m1c1)ij}

(4.3)

where p f (m) stands for the pfaan of the ma-
trix m. 5 now the next step is to expand the
previous quantities as a sum over all the possible
paths  going from x to y

(m1(x, y))ab

p f (m) = exp{

w ab() ab()

ab = xs(xy)

where w () is the path ordered product (along
the path ) of the gauge eld link variables u (x)ab

and () denotes the appropriate product of the
spin matrices:

(  (x, ~)) = l(r  1 ) (r  l )

5the square of the pfaan is the determinant, and up

to a sign

p f (m) =pdet(c) det(m) = exp{

we checked that p f (m) is always positive provided that

where l is the lengh of the path in lattice space
unity and sl(x  y) in the sum indicates the
sum over the paths of the lenght l which goes
from x to y. now we present the main results
obtained by using the results of ref.[20] for the
su (nc) group integration for gauge elds in the
adjoint representation at large nc :

in general the procedure to obtain the masses
can be summarized as follows: extract the eigen-
values of the matrix p()i  ap(~ = ~0), which
are functions of the temporal momentum 0. then
determine pole
which is the (complex) value of
0 for which the eigenvalues vanishes. finally
the lattice masses are given by

0

 the quenched approximation and the ozi
approximations turn out to be exact in the
large nc limit.

 the results obtained at adjoint = 0 are
exact in the large nc limit: the corrections
of o() are subleading in the large nc limit.

now we give the main formulas (at large nc)
for the condensates hoi(x)i and propagators of
the 2-gluino operators gij (x), dened in eq.(4.1)
( with p = 2), obtained after resumming over
paths:

where ec2  c1  c1 with c the charge con-

jugation matrix,  is a function of r, k given in
ref.[11], and si are matrices of the cliord al-
gebra basis in d-dimension. the expressions for
the functions r2(x) and 2(x) can be found in
ref.[11]. we have analogous expressions for the
p-gluino propagators provided that the function
r2, the vectors |sii and the matrix a2(), ap-
pearing in eq.(4.4), are substituted with the cor-
responding ones for the p-gluino operators.

the main diculty in order to calculate the
propagators is given by the calculation of the in-
verse matrix p()i ap() for general p-gluino
operators. this goal has been achieved for the
2-gluino operators in any dimension by means
of the gamma-fermions techniques developed in
ref.[11]. in general for the p-gluino sector (with
p > 2) we have been able to invert this matrix
only in the particular limit where the spectrum
of the p-gluino propagators becomes degenerate.

m = log(|epole

0

|).

(4.5)

note that the lattice masses are dimensionless
quantities and depend only on k and r. the
physical masses are proportional to m/a and so
the states whose lattice mass vanish at the crit-
ical line, are the states that survive this contin-
uum limit.

now we present below the main results for
the spectrum of the 2-gluino and 3-gluino opera-
tors in d=4.

 chiral symmetry is spontaneusly broken.
 the pseudoscalar is the lightest states and
the critical lines where the scalar or the
lightest fermion become massless are out-
side of the physical region in the (k, r) plane.

 all the meson masses become degenerate
only for r   and   0 with the prod-
uct r = f ixed. in particular all the mesons
become massless in the limit where r =
22d1

1

.

 in this limit : the lightest fermion mass can
not be degenerate with the lightest meson
sector and for p > q any mass in the p-
gluino sector (the fermions have p odd) is
higher than any other in the q-gluino sector
in this limit.

from these results we argue that there are no
points in the (k, r) plane giving a possible candi-
date for a supersymmetric continuum limit.

5. conclusions

in order to estimate the error induced by the
quenched simulations on the spectrum, we im-
plemented the quenching in the fundamental the-
ory by introducing a ghost eld. although susy
is lost upon quenching, it turns out that a new

u (1 | 1) symmetry arises, explicitly broken by
the chiral anomaly to z4nc  su (1 | 1). then
we carried out this new symmetry and the cor-
responding anomalies in a low energy lagrangian
scheme. the result is that the anomaly structure
entails a controlable splitting of the vy multiplet
by giving the scalar mass 20% heavier then the
fermionic one. these results are in fair agreement
with the numerical quenched ones within the sta-
tistical errors and provides a rst estimate of the
systematic error associated to the quenching in
lattice susy computations.

from the side of the strong coupling limit
at the large nc : we used the hopping parame-
ter (k) expansion in terms of random walks re-
summed for any value of the wilson parameter r
and close to the origin in k. we found exact an-
alytical results for the condensates, propagators
and spectrum in the large nc limit, for arbitrary
dimensions and general r. by analysing these re-
sults our main conclusion is that the quenched
and the usual ozi approximations are exact at
adjoint = 0 and in the large nc limit. more-
over we proved that in the strong coupling regime
there are no critical lines or points in the (k, r)
plane giving a possible candidate for a supersym-
metric continuum limit, at least in the validity
region of the hopping parameter expansion close
to the origin.
