abstract

a purely algebraic method is devised in order to recover slavnov-taylor identities (sti),
broken by intermediate renormalization. the counterterms are evaluated order by order
in terms of nite amplitudes computed at zero external momenta. the evaluation of the
breaking terms of the sti is avoided and their validity is imposed directly on the vertex
functional. the method is applied to the abelian higgs-kibble model. an explicit mass
term for the gauge eld is introduced, in order to check the relevance of nilpotency. we
show that, since there are no anomalies, the imposition of the sti turns out to be equivalent
to the solution of a linear problem. the presence of st invariants implies that there are
many possible solutions, corresponding to dierent normalization conditions. moreover,
we nd more equations than unknowns (over-determined problem). this leads us to the
consideration of consistency conditions, that must be obeyed if the restoration of sti is
possible.

introduction

in quantum eld theory, many essential physical requirements can be expressed by means of
ward identities, valid for the vertex functional . translating the invariance of the theory
under a certain symmetry in a functional form, ward identities impose several constraints on
the possible structure of . in perturbation theory, renormalization schemes must fulll these
constraints (we speak in this case of an invariant action ), in order to get a nite, physically rel-
evant theory. but very often regularization and subtraction procedures are unable to respect all
the symmetries of the theory, producing green functions that (although nite) are not invariant
and hence not correct.

in the absence of anomalies [1], one can recover exact green functions, generated by the correct
eective action (henceforth denoted by i), by introducing counterterms, designed to compensate
the breaking of ward identities occurring for .

in a preceding paper [2] a strategy was proposed to construct these counterterms in gauge
theories for the case of brst symmetry [3, 4] and related ward identities (sti). the strategy
was applied to the abelian higgs-kibble (hk) model [4, 5] and was based on the knowledge of
the breaking terms of the sti. the sti for the hk model are (appendix a)

c (cid:21) +(cid:16)i(0), i(cid:17) +(cid:16)i, i(0)(cid:17) .

(3)

in order to get the counterterms at the n-th order of perturbation theory, one can construct a
functional (n) whose image under the linearized slavnov-taylor operator is a quantity expressed
by means of the lower-order symmetric green functions i(j), j < n, and the renormalized green
functions (n) at the n-th order.

in this paper we perform the construction of i by the direct imposition of the sti in the
algebraic renormalization framework. thus we avoid the explicit calculation of the breaking
terms. the resulting recursive construction turns out to be much simpler. the problem consists
in the solution of a linear set of equations.
in general, the number of equations exceeds the
number of unknowns (over-determined problem) and moreover many solutions are possible, due
to the existence of st invariants. the last property allows the imposition of the normalization
conditions. the former property yields a set of consistency conditions. their origin is ascribable

4notice that i(0) = (0) (the classical action) is a known quantity.

to the quantum action principle (qap) [1, 6] and to the sti. the role of the nilpotency of s0
is not very clear in the present model. to illustrate this peculiar aspect of the abelian model we
introduce an explicit mass term. such a theory is brst invariant and moreover sti are valid
due to the absence of any anomaly. however the nilpotency of s0 is broken by the mass term.
we verify that the consistency conditions are still valid, although modied by the presence of
the explicit mass term. thus, in some sense, one is tempted to conclude that the consistency
conditions are valid even if s0 is not nilpotent. the last conclusion is stated in a conditional
form, because the model under consideration violates physical unitarity [7], and therefore the
conclusion could not be pertinent for physically relevant models.

finally we stress that the present procedure of the direct imposition of the sti turns out to be
very ecient for deriving an algorithm which is implementable on computer. therefore the aim of
this paper is to provide a preparatory work which can be translated to the standard model and its
extensions. there more involved functional identities and the big amount of possible candidates
for breaking terms and counterterms require an analysis by means of symbolic manipulation.

2 direct algebraic imposition of sti

the qap implies that the breaking terms which spoil the symmetries are, at the rst non-trivial
order, local and compatible with the power-counting. therefore they can be removed, in absence
of anomalies, by non-invariant counterterms. since we are concerned only in the construction
of the counterterms we can replace i with its eective part (i.e. the taylor expansion of any
amplitude in the independent external momenta around zero 5 ). in this way we associate to
i(n) a formal series given by an innite sum of local lorentz-invariant functionals. without
possibility of confusion we can denote the series by i(n) itself

i(n) =xj z d4x m(n)

j mj(x)

(4)

the lorentz- scalar monomials mj(x) in the elds and external sources (and their derivatives)
have to comply with all unbroken symmetries of the theory. in the hk model, we require them
to be c-even and with zero fp-charge. we choose them linearly independent. notice that the
expansion of i in eq. (4) may contain monomials mj with arbitrary positive dimension.
the coecients m(n)
vector space spanned by {mj}jn is denoted by v.

are uniquely determined once the basis {mj}jn has been xed. the

we have to impose recursively on i the validity of the sti

s(i) = 0

we expand the above equation in powers of . the contribution to the n-th order is

[s(i)](n) = s0(i(n)) +

(i(ni), i(i)) = 0

5in the absence of ir problems, as it is in the hk model.

the second term is given by i(j) with j < n. we assume that i(j), j < n satisfy sti. the
unknown quantities are the action-like parts of i(n), (i.e. monomials with dimensions less or
equal to four with the correct symmetry properties) which we denote by (n). (n) is constructed
by using the counterterms (j) with j < n and it is nite. in the expansion of eq.(4), (n) is given
in terms of mk(x) with dim mk(x)  4 and their coecients are denoted by (n)
k . in the same
way, the supercially convergent part of (n) is given in terms of mk(x) with dim mk(x) > 4
and their coecients are denoted by (n)
to indicate collectively
both (n)
. in the hk model, [s(i)](n) is an element of a vector space w spanned by
all possible linearly independent lorentz-invariant, c-even monomials in the elds and external
sources, with fp charge +1.

for r such that dim nr(x) > 5, eq. (9) is an identity by the virtue of the qap. in the absence of
anomalies (as it is in the hk model), one can solve eq. (9) expressing coecients (n)
in terms of
the coecients (n)

part of (n), and from lower order contributions i(l), l < n.

if we can reach this goal, then sti can be restored. notice that at every step one does not
need to consider coecients m(n)
j whose associated monomials have dimension > 6 (for the
(9) for r such that dim nr(x)  5. this
hk model):
allows the recursive algebraic construction of i. however the procedure requires the xing
of the normalization conditions (associated to the existence of st invariants) and the use of the
consistency conditions. both items have been discussed at length in ref. [2]. the normalization
conditions are used in the solution of the linear problem given by eqs. (8) and (9), in order to
simplify the algebra. the evaluation of the physical s-matrix elements requires an analysis of the
two-point functions; in particular one must evaluate the location of the poles and their residua.
the present approach makes use of the normalization conditions in the same manner. however
the consistency conditions show up in a dierent way. in ref. [2] the action counter-terms (n)
are obtained by solving the equation

s0((n)) = (n)

(10)

4

where (n) is given in terms of nite amplitudes. a solution exists only if

s0((n)) = 0

(11)

and this provides the consistency conditions (the use of the ghost equation might be necessary
if nilpotency of the brst is only on-shell).
in the present approach the counter-terms are
evaluated by imposing sti directly on the eective vertex functional and one doesnt need to
evaluate (n). moreover the method makes no use of the nilpotency of the brst. therefore
the consistency conditions in the present approach must be the consequence of a more general
property than (11). in the next section the use of the normalization conditions is briey recalled.
in order to illustrate the problem of the consistency conditions we consider the hk model with
an explicit mass term m . the model is brst symmetric but nilpotency is broken by the explicit
mass term. furthermore it has an unpleasant feature: physical unitarity is violated (as it can
be checked by an explicit calculation). however this fact is not relevant in our discussion.

while cc, cc1 depend on the normalization conditions imposed on external sources counterterms
j2c, j2c1. we notice that the solution of eq.(9) is not unique. consider eq. (6) and suppose

that (n) is a solution. then, for arbitrary c-numbers vj, (n) +pj vjij is again a solution,

provided that s0[ij] = 0. as in [2] we look for action-like s0-invariants preserving unbroken
symmetries of the model. we nd 11 linearly independent s0-invariants i1  i11, listed in
appendix b. for the hk massive model, after taking into account the ghost equation (12) the
s0 operator becomes (n  1)

(16)

(17)

all other invariants ij can be used to put to zero some of the counterterms in , to all orders
in perturbation theory. invariants i9  i11 are used to set to zero the bosonic external sources
counterterms

j2c1, j2c, j1c.

(18)

on the contrary, it is not possible to put to zero fermionic external sources counterterms. then
one gets contributions to (n) from the fermionic mass term. the remaining ij are used to put
to zero the following counterterms:

1, 2

21, a2

1 , f 2
 5a , i 52
.



,

(19)

(n) is then completely determined from the set of linear equations (9), once we adopt the
normalization conditions xed in eqs.(18) and (19).
in particular, conditions in eq.(19) are
obtained according to the introduction of a hierarchy in the counterterms, designed to get
maximal decoupling among equations (9). consider two action-like monomials mj(x) and
mj (x) such that their s0-images do not contain common terms; then their coecients j and
j  can never appear in the same equation in (9): they do not couple. we decompose the
counterterms (n) in disjoint sectors, thanks to normalization conditions (18) and (19). next we
nd it convenient to solve eqs.(9) for amplitudes with lower number of external legs and higher
derivatives in the external momenta. this reduces the number of graphs that must be evaluated
(at the cost of a higher number of derivatives). notice that the analysis of counterterms sectors
is indeed equivalent to the construction of coecients aj
r in eq.(8), by taking into account the
normalization conditions in eqs. (18), (19). since the dierence in s0 between the massive and
massless hk models only involves terms depending on j1, j2, the same counterterms sectors
can be used in the massive case as well as in the massless one. we recover the conventional hk
model by taking the limit m  0 in the expression of (n). this limit is smooth.

4 consistency conditions

in the higgs-kibble boson-gauge sector there are more equations than unknowns (over-determined
problem). we then nd a set of consistency conditions associated to the linear problem. for
the massive case they are:

 . the above consistency conditions can be obtained from
a quite general equation. let us introduce the linearized version sf of the st operator s(f )

(26)

(28)

suppose that we have restored the sti up to the (n  1)-th order in perturbation theory, i.e.
s(i)(j) = 0 for j = 0, 1, . . . , n  1. at the n-th order of perturbation theory equation (28)
implies

s0[s()(n)] = 

(n)

m 2

now we prove that in the abelian hk model the r.h.s.
terms of the sti at the order n

is zero. let us consider the breaking

(n)  s()(n).

(30)

from the qap we know that (n) is a local functional with dimension less or equal ve and
fp-charge equal one. then by construction

is a local functional and has dimension less or equal four and fp-charge equal two.

there are no terms with these properties (r d4xc(cid:3)c = 0,r d4xcc = 0,r d4xcac is not allowed

by c-conjugation, etc.). this implies that

s0[s()(n)] = 0.

(32)

on account of the results obtained in sect. 2, s()(n) can be expanded on monomials nr(x)
(see eqs.(7),(8)) with dimension  5, whose coecients are constructed according to eq.(9). the
imposition of eq.(32) then yields a set of consistency conditions equivalent to eqs.(20)-(24).

we illustrate this procedure for the consistency condition in eq.(24). we denote by ncaa2 the
coecient of the monomial caa2 in the expansion of s()(n), and by ncaa2 the analogous
coecient for caa2. the coecient of the monomial a2(cid:3)cc in s0[s()(n)] turns out to be
equal to ncaa2  ncaa2. this must be zero according to eq.(32):

ncaa2  ncaa2 = 0

(33)

the method of sect.2 allows the explicit evaluation of ncaa2 and ncaa2. according to
eq.(9), we get

ncaa2 = evh2 aa2 + ej1ca + j2ca2i  4a4 +

and

ncaa2 = evh2a a2 + ej1cai  4a4 +

(35)

inserting eqs.(34) and (35) in eq.(33) we nally recover the consistency condition (24).

5 conclusions

in the present paper we propose a method for imposing sti directly on the eective vertex
functional (its formal taylor series expansion at zero external momenta), without going through
the explicit evaluation of the breaking terms. the method can be applied to any (not sym-
metrically) renormalized gauge theory where the renormalization procedure (regularization and

8

subtraction of divergent parts) violates sti. the algorithm amounts to nd a basis of all action-
like local lorentz-invariant monomials and their st transforms. preserved symmetries have
to be imposed on the allowed monomials (c-conjugation, fp charge neutrality, etc.). brst
sources have to be considered in the construction of the monomials. the counter-terms are
constructed order by order by solving a linear problem where the input data are a set of nite
zero-momenta amplitudes of dimension ve and six. the existence of a set of st invariants
allows to x an equivalent number of normalization conditions. these are chosen in order to
simplify the solution and the evaluation of the nite amplitudes (normalization conditions at
zero momenta). there is a number of consistency conditions associated to the linear problem.
we suggest the use of a general property of the sti (s0[s()(n)] = 0 for the example considered
here, i.e. an abelian gauge model) in order to nd the necessary consistency conditions that
should be satised by the nite amplitudes relevant for the linear problem.
