abstract

the relative entropy of the massive free bosonic eld theory is studied on
various compact riemann surfaces as a universal quantity with physical signi-
cance, in particular, for gravitational phenomena. the exact expression for the
sphere is obtained, as well as its asymptotic series for large mass and its tay-
lor series for small mass. one can also derive exact expressions for the torus
but not for higher genus. however, the asymptotic behaviour for large mass
can always be establishedup to a constantwith heat-kernel methods. it con-
sists of an asymptotic series determined only by the curvature, hence common
for homogeneous surfaces of genus higher than one, and exponentially vanishing
corrections whose form is determined by the concrete topology. the coecient
of the logarithmic term in this series gives the conformal anomaly.

1 introduction

the entropy of a statistical model relative to its critical point has been shown to be an
interesting quantity in eld theory, especially in regard to the renormalization group
[1]. on the one hand, it exhibits better behaviour than the free energy when the ultra-
violet cuto is sent to innity and, on the other hand, it is monotonic with the coupling
constants, unlike the free energy. this second property makes it suitable to embody
the irreversible nature of the renomalization group, which can in particular be sub-
stantiated in a nite geometry as monotonicity with respect to its characteristic scale
[2]. the computation of the relative entropy for various models on a cylinder clearly
shows its monotonicity [2]. the cylinder is appropriate to illustrate nite size-eects
but it may not be the nite geometry of choice in the context of renormalization-group
irreversibility. there is a celebrated result on renormalization-group irreversibility
in two-dimensional (2d) eld theories, zamolodchikov c theorem. the monotonicity
theorem for the relative entropy on the cylinder, once it is conveniently formulated,
resembles zamolodchikov c theorem [2]. however, this resemblance can hardly lead to
a direct relationship, since the proof of zamolodchikov c theorem demands rotation as
well as translation symmetry. in other words, that proof demands to consider a max-
imally symmetric space, namely, the sphere, the plane or the hyperbolic plane. both
the sphere and the hyperbolic plane possess an infrared scale, the curvature radius,
but only the sphere is nite and therefore the computation of the relative entropy on
the sphere is of particular value.

from a dierent point of view, the calculation of the spectrum of the laplacian
operator on general compact riemann surfaces has held the interest of rst mathe-
maticians [3, 4] and second physicist [5, 6] for some time. the partition function of the
bosonic massive eld theory on a compact riemann surface is a global object which
can be constructed from the knowledge of the spectrum of the laplacian operator.
since this spectrum is highly dependent on the topologic and geometric properties of
the riemann surface, these properties are reected by the partition function. however,
this function, or say the free energy, is ultraviolet (uv) divergent and hence ill dened.
fortunately, the relative entropy of the 2d bosonic massive eld theory is uv nite
[2] and so it is likely to have a role in the geometrical characterization of a riemann
surface. this characterization consists of local parameters, namely, the curvature, and
global parameters, specifying the boundary conditions and topologically signicant.
the study of homogeneous surfaces will provide insight into the dependence of the
relative entropy on both types of parameters.

generically, the relative entropy is not related to the quantum eld theory entropy,
but there is a direct relation on the torus (or cylinder) geometry. the relative entropy
is a geometric entropy, of the sort already considered in connection with the entropy of
black holes [7]. indeed, the geometry relevant to this case is that of the cone, which is
non-compact and is actually related to the cylinder geometry, and hence to the usual
quantum eld theory entropy, as were analyzed in ref. [2]. one can expect that the

2

relative entropy for homogeneous spaces will be applicable in a cosmological context,
once suitably generalized. thus the results of this paper must have some bearing on
entropic considerations in de sitter and anti-de sitter space-time. an attempt at in-
troducing the maximum entropy principle in quantum cosmology has been made in
ref. [8]. on the other hand, the application of scaling and renormalization group con-
cepts in gravitation [9] and cosmology [10] is gaining momentum. therefore, it seems
interesting to study of properties of the entropy relative to the scales dening some
curved space. furthermore, the role of the relative entropy as a function monotonic
with the renormalization group may as well have some relevance in modern theories of
quantum gravity, as recent work seems to indicate [11].

therefore, our main concern here will be the computation of the universal relative
entropy of the 2d bosonic massive eld theory on homogeneous and compact riemann
surfaces, for its own sake and with a view to its application in connection with zamolod-
chikov c theorem. for the plane and cylinder, the relative entropy has been computed
in ref. [2]. since we are now concerned with compact riemann surfaces, we shall rst
focus on the simplest case, namely, the sphere. in general, the topological classication
of compact riemann surfaces is given by their genus, that is, the number of handles in
a three-dimensional embedding. the genus of the sphere is zero, of course. compact
riemann surfaces of higher genus, with zero or negative constant curvature, will also
be considered here, even though they are not globally isotropic, since they are derived
from the plane or the hyperbolic space by imposing boundary conditions on a nite
domain which break rotation invariance. the case of zero curvature is the torus and
is actually related to the cylinder, treated in ref. [2]. compact riemann surfaces of
genus g > 1 are always related to the hyperbolic plane. the spectrum of the laplacian
on them is too complicated to allow derivation of closed expressions for the relative
entropy. thus, the case g > 1 will be discussed summarily and only some general
properties of the free energy and the relative entropy will be extracted. the method
used to obtain these properties, namely, the heat-kernel method, is however of general
interest and we shall dedicate considerable attention to it.

a large literature has been devoted to the computation of vacuum energy densities
on various manifolds, mostly in regard to eld theory in curved space-time and to the
casimir eect. this energy is divergent, of course, and needs regularization. the usual
technique is the zeta-function regularization [12, 13, 14], as introduced earlier in the
mathematical literature [4].
it is related to the heat-kernel representation that will
be utilized here by a mellin transform. we will see how this relationship materializes
for g > 1 riemann surfaces in the last section.1 however, since the relative entropy
is a universal quantity we do not need to bother with prescribing any regularization
method and we shall only do it to make connections, for instance, with the conformal
anomaly or with partition functions in string theory.

1for a comprehensive review of all these techniques, see ref. [15].

2 the relative entropy of the sphere

the free energy w , namely, minus the logarithm of the partition function, for the
cuto bosonic massive eld theory can be expressed as [1, 2]

w [m, ]   ln z[m, ] =

~p 2 + m2

2

.

ln

1

2x~p

(1)

the set of momenta to be summed depends on the type of geometry and is such that
~p 2 < 2. if we try to remove the cuto we see that w is uv divergent, and hence it is
non universal. the eigenvalues of the laplacian on the sphere are well known, namely,
~p 2 = l (l + 1)/r2, where r is the sphere radius. thus, the sum over momenta is a sum
over l and we write

w [r, ] =

1
2

lmax

(2 l + 1) ln

xl=1

l (l + 1) + r

( r)2

,

(2)

where we have introduced the dimensionless coupling r = (m r)2 and the uv cuto is
related to the maximum value of l,   lmax/r. we have also removed the zero mode
l = 0 from the sum, which is not allowed for r = 0, and we have taken the degeneracy
into account by the factor 2 l + 1.

from the previous expression of w one can obtain the relative entropy as a universal
quantity, that is, as a convergent series in the limit lmax  . however, the sum of
that series is very hard to carry out, so we choose another way. one can lower the
degree of divergence of w by taking derivatives with respect to r. in fact,

dw
dr

=

1
2

lmax

xl=1

2 l + 1

l (l + 1) + r

,

(3)

which is still logarithmically divergent. we can remove this divergence just by sub-
stracting its value at r = 0 and write, in the limit lmax  ,

dw
dr

r

= 



xl=1

2 l + 1

[l (l + 1) + r] l (l + 1)

.

(4)

hence, we dene the function u(r) := (dw/dr)  (dw/dr)r=0, which turns out to be
computable in terms of the digamma function (x). the full expression is rather long;
it is given in an appendix.

the function u(r) has interest on its own, since it is the substracted energy, but
we are more interested in the relative entropy. this can be expressed in terms of u(r)
as

s(r) = w (r)  w (0)  r

dw (r)

dr

=

4

r

z0

u(s) ds  r u(r).

(5)

unfortunately, this integral cannot be done in closed form. however, it is possible to
establish the behaviour of s(r) for small or large r. for large r the correlation length is
much smaller than the radius of the sphere and the result in the plane, s(r) = r/(8),
should be relevant. as r   the sum over l can be substituted by an integral,



xl=1

(2 l + 1)  a



z0

(2)2 ,

where the area of the sphere is a = 4r2. we see that to compare with the value in the
plane we must multiply this value by 4. to extract the dominant large r behaviour
of u(r), we use (x)  ln x. a lengthy but straightforward calculation shows that
u(r)   ln r/2. hence, using rst an integration by parts,

s(r) = 

r

z0

as expected.

the full asymptotic expansion of s(r) near innity results from that of u(r), which
in turn can be worked out with help of the known asymptotic expansion of (x).
however, this procedure yields the asymptotic expansion of s(r) only up to a constant,
because the condition s(0) = 0 cannot be implemented. it begins as

s(r)

(6)

the presence of a subleading term ln r was to be expected, owing to the existence of a
conformal anomaly for any riemann surface, coming from the logarithmic divergence
of the critical free energy. the logarithmic term of the free energy turns out to be

w = 


12

ln(2 r2),

(7)

where  is the uv cuto, r the size, and  is the integral of the curvature divided
by 4, equal to the euler-poincare number of the riemann surface, according to the
gauss-bonnet theorem. the calculation of the conformal anomaly from the logarithmic
divergence of the critical free energy is probably very old but was popularized by the
development of string theory [5]. it was further discussed in ref. [13], in the context of
the casimir energy. in the presence of mass, a term proportional to ln(m2/2) must
appear when the correlation length m1 becomes smaller than r. hence, it is not
surprising to have the term ln r in the previous expansion. the concrete way in which
it appears will be explained in section 4, when we consider the heat-kernel derivation
of the asymptotic expansion. this is a much more eective method to nd the large r
behaviour, capable of providing the generic form of the coecients of the asymptotic
series for arbitrary riemann surfaces.

a plot of s(r) is shown in fig. 1, in comparison with the asymptotic behaviour
given by just the two growing terms in the previous formula (6). the agrement is quite
remarkable, even almost down to r = 1. the numerical value of the missing constant
is approximately 0.254381.

fig. 1: s(r) on the sphere compared to the rst two terms of
the asymptotic formula (6) and to the taylor expansion (8)

the small r behaviour of s(r) is given by the power series expansion near r = 0, which
is easy to derive since s(r) = r u(r). we obtain that

s(r) =

where (n)(x) is the polygamma function. the behaviour provided by the series trun-
cated to this order is compared with the total s(r) in the second plot of fig. 1. the
radius of convergence of the taylor series is determined by the singular points of u(r).
since the only singularities of (x) are simple poles for non-positive integers, it is easy
to see that the singularity closest to r = 0 is a simple pole at r = 2, and hence the
radius of convergence is 2.

3 the relative entropy of the torus

we consider the torus as a rectangular box with periodic boundary conditions, which
is the natural nite geometry in many applications. one can slightly generalize the
boundary conditions by considering periodicity along two non-orthogonal directions,
that is, by letting the box be a parallelogram. although a parallelogram is in principle
equivalent to a rectangle by an ane transformation, this is only true in real geometry,
because in complex geometry such transformation is not allowed. nevertheless, we shall
consider a rectangle for simplicity and deduce the more general form from holomorphic
factorization.

6

the partition function on the torus in the critical theory, m = 0, is essentially
the modulus of dedekinds function ( ). the classical proof of this result involves
the use of the proper time representation and poisson resummation, after analytical
continuation in the manner of -function regularization, since the partition function
is uv divergent. this method can be extended to the non-critical theory [16] (also
[17]). however, we favour a method similar to the one used for the sphere, where we
calculate the energy u(r). the substraction of the critical value will not be necessary
since the uv divergence lends itself to straightforward identication.

let us l and m denote the periods in the horizontal and vertical directions, re-

spectively. then (see appendix)

w (r) =

m
2



xl=

(l) +



xl=

ln(cid:2)1  em (l)(cid:3) + c,

(9)

where we have introduced the one-boson energies (l) = p(2 l/l)2 + m2 and where

c is a constant irrelevant for the relative entropy.

now, we may notice that the previous expression for w can be interpreted as the free
energy of quantum 1d bosons conned in a segment of length l at nite temperature
t = 1/m and constitutes a slight generalization of the expression for the cylinder
considered before [2]. to prevent a divergence when r = 0 we remove the zero mode
l = 0 and write

the uv divergences concentrate in the 1d vacuum energy e0 = pl=1 (l). however,
for r = 0 they can be -regularized to give e0 = (2/l) (1) = /(6 l). the other
term is the free energy of the bosonic excitations of the vacuum and is nite. for
r = 0 it combines with e0 to yield w   ln z = ln (q)2, where (q) is the dedekind
function, q = exp 2i and the modular parameter is  = i (m/l). in the case of a
parallelogram the modular parameter is, of course, complex and z = 1/[(q) (q)].

most of the discussion about the relative entropy of the cylinder in ref. [2] holds
as well for the torus. hence, we change the notation for the vertical period, m  ,
in accord with the 1d thermodynamic interpretation. the specic relative entropy is
related to the quantum 1d entropy of free bosons, sq, as

s(r; l, ) = s(r; l) 

sq

2 l

6 2 ,

where

s(r; l) = e0(r; l)  e0(0; l)  r

e0(r; l) :=
the quantity e0(0; l) = /(6 l2) is dual to /(6 2). note that

is the relative entropy of the cylinder. of course, liml s(r; l) =  r/2. while
s(r; l, ) is modular invariant, the 1d quantum entropy sq comes only from the free
energy of the bosonic excitations, namely, the second term in (10), and is not modular
invariant. s(r; l, ) can be computed by the heat-kernel method, studied in next
section, in terms of a double series of bessel functions.
its cylinder limit coincides
with the single series of bessel functions computed in ref. [2]. on the other hand, it
is feasible to obtain the perturbative expansion of w near m = 0 [16], and from it
the expansion of s(r; l, ). the asymptotic expansion for large m is just given by the
value of s for the plane and it comes from the rst term, s(r; l), in (11), since the
second one decays exponentially with l. a more precise description of this asymptotic
behaviour is provided by the heat-kernel method.

the quantum 1d entropy of free bosons, sq, can be related to the entanglement
entropy of black holes in 1 + 1 dimensions. the euclidean version of rindler space
is just the punctured plane, which is conformally dieomorphic to the cylinder.
in
addition, the entanglement entropy of this space can be computed with a path integral
that reduces it to an ordinary entropy, when considered on the cylinder [7]. therefore,
one can use the formulas above, taking into account that the conformal transformation
implies that the modular parameter becomes a function of the quotient of the two
cutos for the radius, namely, i/ = l/ = ln(r1/r0). the complete expression of the
cylinder entropy can be deduced from the results in ref. [2]. the rst term of the low
mass expansion agrees with the one calculated by other methods in ref. [7].

4 heat-kernel techniques

the computation of thermodynamic quantities for the sphere or the torus, regardless
of ulterior diculties, begins with the preliminary step of determining the eigenvalues
of the laplacian. unfortunately, even this preliminary step cannot be taken for an
arbitrary compact riemman surface. therefore, one cannot start from a more or less
formal but explicit expression of those quantities. nevertheless, the situation is not
hopeless for there is a powerful method to extract information on thermodynamic
quantities, namely, the heat kernel representation of green functions [3, 4, 5, 6]. we
now study this method, for the purpose of applying it to g > 1 riemman surfaces and
for its own sake: actually, it provides useful insight for the sphere and the torus.

first, let us recall that

w (m) =

t r~x,~y g(~x, ~y),

(13)

with g(~x, ~y) the green function of the helmholtz equation, namely, (+m2) g(~x, ~y) =

(14)

called the heat kernel, k(~x, ~y; t), we can express g as a laplace transform,

gr(~x, ~y) =

after dening r := m2. furthermore,

(20)

(21)

where c1 and c2 are two integration constants that are actually innite due to uv
divergences. of course, this expression agrees with the one derived in [2] using uv
regularization in momentum space.

in a general curved surface t r~x,~y k(~x, ~y; t) =r d2x k(~x, ~x; t) and it is the integrated

heat kernel for coincident points. note that k(~x, ~x; t) explicitly depends on the point
~x. however, for homogeneous surfaces it becomes independent of it. according to (16),

u(r)

where k(t) is the heat kernel for coincident points. if the eigenvalues of the laplacian
are available,  n = n n, the heat kernel is just

k(t) =

en t.



xn=0

(23)

the rst eigenvalue is 0  0, corresponding to the constant solution; the others are
negative and ordered by their absolute valuein fact, 1 < 1/4 [4]. substituting for
k(t) in the integral representation (22) we recover the expression for the energy used
before,

u(r)

(24)

for example, if we consider the torus, n = (2)2 |k|2, where k  , the lattice
dual to , the one denig periodicity on the torus. then we can use the jacobi identity
to write

k(t) = xk

exp[(2)2 |k|2 t] =

(25)

the latter sum is 1 + o[exp(1/t)], reproducing the result for u in the plane plus
corrections vanishing exponentially when r  .

which can be easily shown to be convergent at t = 0, taking into account the behaviour
of the heat kernel for small t (26). for a compact surface, it also converges as t   if
we remove the zero mode, since then k(t) decays exponentially, according to eq. (23).
to obtain the asymptotic r   expansion we could be tempted to just substitute
the aymptotic expansion (26) into this integral. however, we would encounter that the
coecients are given by integrals divergent as t  . the problem is that we cannot
prolong the aymptotic expansion (26) to t = . however, the aymptotic expansion
(26) can be substituted into the integral for s(r),

(31)

we can obtain the whole asymptotic series of s(r) for the sphere by just taking the
coecients from the corresponding asymptotic series of k(t), given by eq. (28) with
(1)n inserted. the coecients of its succesive terms coincide with the ones in the
previous expression (6) except for the one of the logarithmic term. this term, which
was already remarked, is particularly interesting and we now discuss it in more detail.

4.1 the logarithmic term in the asymptotic expansion of s(r)

and the conformal anomaly

the logarithmic term in the asymptotic expansion of s(r) comes from the constant
term in the asymptotic power series of k(t) (26), namely, a1/(4).
in particular,
formula (28) yields a1 = 1/3, for the sphere and hyperbolic plane, respectively. if we
substitute this constant for k(t) in (30) we obtain

(32)

(notice the slight abuse of notation, for we deal here with truncated quantities.) for
a curved compact homogeneous surface the gauss-bonnet theorem implies that a =
2 || = 4 |g  1|, where  is the euler-poincare number. then the coecient of the
logarithmic term of the total value of s(r) is

only related to the topology of the riemann surface. this result also holds for compact
surfaces of variable curvature.

we can obtain as well the coecient of the logarithmic term of w . upon integrating

u(r) twice over r, we conclude that

w (r)

a

=

a1
8

ln r + c1 r + c2.

(33)

hence we can try to connect with the critical value stated in (7) as follows. let us
return to the heat-kernel representation and perform the divergent integral for w (r),
eq. (17), with a lower cuto:

w (r)

(0, m2 ) =

8

[ ln(m2 )   + o(m2 )], (34)

where (0, x) is the incomplete gamma function. this agrees with the previous result.
we may interpret the cuto in t as an uv cuto,   2. reinstating the radius of
curvature we can then split m2  so that

ln(m2 ) = ln r  ln(2 r2).

the second term agrees with the critical value, eq. (7), but the rst term diverges as
r  0. in fact, this limit is not meaningful since the logarithmic term arises in the
asymptotic expansion for large r. neither is it meaningful to utilize the asymptotic
expansion of k(t), eq. (26), to obtain the small-r behaviour: for r = 0 the integrals
for thermodynamic quantities are determined by the entire range of t and not just by
its asymptotic behaviour, whether it be for small or large t. nevertheless, eq. (26) can
still be utilized to determine the form of the divergence of w (0) at t = 0. indeed,

w [0, ] =

in the innite-cuto limit,  r  1, we can discard the negative powers of  and this
equation is none but the conformal anomaly equation for a rigid scale transformation
(recall that a1 is just the riemann curvature divided by 3). integration over  yields
the desired term,

notice however that w (0) can also be calculated with zeta-function regularization
and that it yields a nite result [6]. this may seem puzzling, for we have then lost track
of the conformal anomaly. in any event, w (0) is a pure number and its value is to some
extent irrelevant. nevertheless, in the massive case, zeta-function regularization also
yields a nite w (r), as we shall remark in the next section. but then the conformal
anomaly can be extracted from the asymptotics of w (r) for large r. moreover, with
any type of regularization, the asymptotics of s(r) for large r provides the conformal
anomaly. this conclusion is not particularly interesting for the massive bosonic eld
theory, the only one considered here, but it may be very interesting for interacting
theories.

we have concluded that the coecient of the logarithmic term in the entropy must
be the opposite of the conformal anomaly, that is, /12. while we had obtained 1/3
in eq. (6) now we get /12 = 1/6. this discrepancy stems from having suppressed
the zero mode in the calculation of u(r) for the sphere. this contributes 1/2 in any
compact surface and 1/2  1/3 = 1/6. we may make a little disgression here and
recall that the calculation of the small-t behaviour of tensor laplacians on compact
riemann surfaces provides a proof of the riemann-roch theorem [5, 22]. in the case
of the scalar laplacian,  =  , this theorem states that

i( ) = dim ker   dim ker  = 1  g,

(37)

z is the covariant derivative on forms. then ker1

where the adjoint  = 1
z is the
space of abelian dierentials, with dimension g and ker  is the space of holomorphic
functions, that is, constants, with dimension 1 (the zero mode). their dierence is
1  g = /2. according to our discussion on the presence of logarithmic terms in
r, we can interpret the zero mode as the logarithmic term for r  0 whereas the
logarithmic terms found in the asymptotics r   are related to the existence of
non-trivial boundary conditions and hence with the existence of abelian dierentials.
they substract from 1 the right number g such that the dierence is proportional to
the euler-poincare number. indeed, we observe that, e.g., for the torus the zero-mode

term ln(cid:2)1  el m(cid:3)  ln(m l) as m  0, while it vanishes exponentially in the opposite
limit, m  . this is in accord with the torus being at, so that  = 0.

5 thermodynamic quantities for compact riemann

surfaces of higher genus

a compact riemann surface of g > 1 can be characterized by its fundamental group.
when this surface is represented in its covering space, the hyperbolic plane, it gives rise
to a tesselation of it, whose tiles are identied by a discrete group of motions isomorphic
to the fundamental group. since the total group of motions of the hyperbolic plane
is sl(2, ir), that group is one of its discrete non-commutative subgroups, which are
called fuchsian groups. this construction is analogous to the construction of the torus
by factoring the plane by a lattice , where the fundamental group is zz  zz. we have
seen that there is an expression for the heat kernel of the torus as the kernel in the
plane plus a series of powers of exp(1/t) (25). there is a non-commutative analogue
for g > 1, namely, the selberg trace formula [4],

k(t) =

xn=1x{}

(38)
in this formula {} are the primitive conjugacy classes of the fuchsian group and l is
the length of the shortest geodesic along the corresponding non-contractible loop. the
rst term is just the integral representation of the heat kernel in the hyperbolic plane
h (27). it admits a dierent representation, more useful for computations, derived
from the form of the corresponding green function [4, 5, 6],

kh (t) =



z0

db

b eb2/(4t)
sinh (b/2)

.

although the selberg trace formula is a much more complicated formula than the
abelian one (25), it has the same structure; namely, it is a sum of the part correspond-
ing to the innite surface, now the hyperbolic plane, plus o[exp(1/t)] corrections
due to the boundary conditions. as well as for the torus, these corrections give rise to
exponentially vanishing terms which do not appear in the asymptotic expansion of the
entropy around r = . therefore, all the higher genus riemann surfaces share the
same asymptotic expansion in r.

formula (38) has been widely used to establish the modular dependence of partition
functions in string theory [6, 22]. the partition functions in string theory are those
of critical theories and selbergs formula results in generalizations of the dedekind
function of the torus to g > 1; they are called selbergs zeta functions [4]. although we
are interested here in the massive case, the procedure to calculate the critical w [4, 6]
actually applies to the non-critical one as well. it consists of a part corresponding to
the hyperbolic plane, hence common for any homogeneous surface with g > 1, and a

14

part in terms of selbergs zeta function, which accounts for the topology of the surface:

notice that it is a meromorphic function of x with one single pole at x = 1, as long as
|r| < 1/4. in the critical case the common part can be calculated exactly to yield

selbergs zeta functions is dened as

(42)

(43)

the function r(x), as a regularization of w on the hyperbolic plane, must lead to
the asymptotic expansion of the relative entropy provided by eqs. (28) and (29). the
selberg zeta function leads to the asymptotically vanishing corrections.

6 conclusions

we have seen that the general structure of the entropy of the free massive bosonic eld
theory on compact homogeneous riemann surfaces consists of a part corresponding to
the maximally-symmetric surface, namely, to the sphere, the plane or the hyperbolic
plane, and a part due to the boundary conditions. the rst part can be expressed
as a complicated function, analytic in r  [0,). furthermore, it has an asymptotic
expansion around r = , which is fully computable. the second part embodies the
topology and is more delicate to treat, but it vanishes exponentially as r grows and
therefore does not appear in the asymptotic expansion. the behaviour of the entropy
for small rthe critical limitis also calculable, in terms of a convergent series. it
is strongly dependent on the global parameters dening the topological nature of the
surface. indeed, one can observe, for example, that the series for the sphere (8) has
nothing to do with the one for the cylinder, obtained in [2]. the kth term of the small-

r expansion is easily seen to be proportional to pn (n)k, beginning with k = 2.

15

but for g > 1 these sums cannot be computed analytically, because the laplacian
eigenvalues are not available.

the monotonic character of the entropy can be checked in our calculations. for large
m the entropy tends to m2/(8), independently of the topology of the surface, which
is the value for the plane. however, the topology lets itself be felt in the subleading
term, proportional to ln m, which is actually related to the conformal anomaly. these
two terms are the only ones divergent as m  . there is also a constant term in the
asymptotic expansion, which cannot be determined exactly, however. the three terms
together already provide a good approximation down to m l  1. as we decrease m we
approach criticality and the entropy becomes very sensitive to large scale peculiarities of
the surface, as already remarked, but one can check that it always remains monotonic.
we may wonder how much of the above can be generalized to higher dimensions
or to interacting eld theories. the spectrum of the laplacian and the heat kernel
for homogeneous spaces are well known [20].
in fact, the heat kernel is simpler in
odd-dimensional homogeneous spaces than in even-dimensional ones, so the formulas
for the three-dimensional sphere or hyperbolic space turn out to be simpler as well. as
regards massive interacting theories, an asymptotic expansion for large m must exist
in general and, moreover, the leading and subleading terms can also be studied. the
leading term is always proportional to m2 for dimensional reasons, and its coecient
positive. to determine this coecient one can use the thermodynamic-bethe-ansatz
computation of the universal bulk term of the free energy, as discussed before [2]. the
subleading term is likely to be related to the conformal anomaly, c (/6) ln m, where
c is the central charge of the conformal eld theory for m = 0. this may provide a
new way to nd the central charge of a model. the small-m behaviour can be studied
with conformal perturbation theory, see ref. [2]. however, it shall crucially depend on
the nature of the surface, as well as on the particular eld theory. this perturbation
theory is presumably convergent for strongly relevant perturbations, like that of the
free bosonic eld theory.

the apparent pole at r = 0 must cancel and a careful analysis shows that it does; the
pole at r = 1/4 cancels as well. notice that when r > 1/4 the argument of the digamma
functions becomes complex. nevertheless, u(r) remains real and is an analytic function
of r at r = 1/4.

u(r)  u(0) is convergent and one can apply it to it. the ensuing series represents
w (r)  u(0) r minus a uv quadratically divergent constant. of course, u(0) r is the
uv logarithmic divergence of w (r). since the uv divergences of w (r) can be easily
