abstract

the pahse transition from instanton-dominated quantum tunneling regime

to sphaleron-dominated classical crossover regime is explored in (1+1)-

dimensional scalar eld theory when spatial coordinate is compactied.

it

is shown that the type of sphaleron transition is critically dependent on the

circumference of the spatial coordinate. based on our main result we con-

jecture the type of winding number phase transition in mottola-wipf model

when spatial coordinate is compactied and discuss briey its physical impli-

cations in baryon number violating process.

recently, much attention is paid to the winding number phase transition from instanton

[1]-dominated quantum tunneling regime to the sphaleron [2]-dominated classical crossover

regime in su(2)-higgs model [36], which is believed to describe electroweak phase transition

in early universe. the active research in this eld is mainly for the hope to understand

baryon number violating process, which is very important consequence of electroweak chiral

anomaly [7].

since, unfortunately, the sphaleron transition in su(2)-higgs model or real electroweak

theories is too complicated to treat and it needs lot a numerical calculation, it is very hard

to understand the real mechanism of the electroweak phase transition by investigating these

models directly. hence a decade ago mottola and wipf(mw) [8] adopted a non-linear o(3)

model with a soft symmetry breaking term as a toy model for the study of baryon number

violating process. this model has an advantage that analytical expression of the sphaleron

solution can be derived by paralleling mantons original argument. recently, the sphaleron

phase transition in this model with and without skyrme term is examined [9,10].

comparing, however, the result of ref. [10] with that of ref. [4], one can obviously

conclude that mw model in itself cannot play a key role of toy model for electroweak

theory when mh > 6.665mw , where mh and mw are masses of higgs and w particles,

respectively. in this region su(2)-higgs theory exhibits a smooth second-order sphaleron

transition accompanied by a sharp rst-order transition in the quantum tunneling regime.

on the other hand mw model exhibits a rst-order sphaleron transition in the full range of

its parameter space. hence it may be helpful to understand the real nature of the electroweak

phase transition if one can nd a simple toy model which exhibits rst-order and second-

order sphaleron transitions depending on its own parameter value. we argue in the present

letter that this can be achieved by giving a nontrivial topology to the spatial coordinate in

mw model.

if we impose a compactied spatial coordinate x, it naturally generates a periodic bound-

ary condition (x = 0) = (x = l), where  is arbitrary scalar eld and l is a circumference

of a compactied spatial coordinate. on the other hand, the decay transition of a metastable

2

state at nite temperature is governed by classical conguration which satises another pe-

riodic boundary condition at temporal coordinate: ( = 0) = ( = 0 + 1/t ), where

 and t are euclidean time and temperature. this means we have two distinct periodic

boundary conditions in this case, which makes the mechanism of the sphaleron phase tran-

sition to be very complicate. in this letter we will explore this issue by introducing a simple

(1+1)-dimensional scalar eld model and show the type of sphaleron transition is dependent

on the circumference of the spatial coordinate. based on the nal result of the present let-

ter, we will conjecture the type of sphaleron transition for mw model in s1. the detailed

computation on mw model in compactied space will be discussed elsewhere.

now, let us start with euclidean action

se = z d dx

it is very easy to show that sphaleron phase transition for the model (1) with usual non-

compactied spatial coordinate is smooth second-order if non-linear perturbation [11] or

number of negative modes approach [12] are employed. both approaches yield an identical

sucient condition for the rst-order sphaleron transition and are very useful for the dis-

cussion of the eect of the arbitrary wall thickness in the bubble nucleation [13]. fig. 1

shows the bubble nucleation and action-vs-temperature diagram in this simple model. the

existence of the wiggly solution (fig. 1(c)) guarantees the type of the sphaleron transition

to be smooth second-order. this can be also conrmed by action-vs-temperature diagram

given at fig. 1(a).

now, let us consider action (1) with a compactied spatial coordinate.

in this case

as mentioned before sphaleron solution s(x) must satisfy a periodic boundary condition

s(x) = s(x + l). the explicit expression of s(x) is [14,15]

s(x) =

a


(k)dn[(k)x, ],

3

(3)

where k is modulus of elliptic function and

 =

,

2k
1 + k
1 + k
1 + k2

(k) = 

(4)

.

since jacobian elliptic function dn[y, ] has period 2k(), where k is complete elliptic

function [16], the circumference l is dened

ln =

2n
(k)

k(),

(5)

where n is some integer. using s(x) the classical action for sphaleron solution is straight-

forwardly computed:

1 + k2 "4e() 

x ! + u(s)# = n

1 + k2 k()# ,

(1 + k)2

s1


,

(6)

where  is period of sphaleron solution and e is another complete elliptic function. since

s/ is interpreted as a barrier height of energy, the barrier height with l = ln is n-times

higher than that with l = l1, and hence decay-rate is negligible for large n. in this letter,

therefore, we will conne ourselves to only l = l1 case.

now we apply the result of non-linear perturbation presented in ref. [11] in this model.

for this we expand (x,  ) around sphaleron s(x);

(x,  ) = s(x) + (x,  ),

where (x,  ) is small uctuation eld. inserting it into the equation of motion

one can get

where

it is well-known [15] that the eigenvalue equation of h is standard lame equation:

d2

dz2 +h  n(n + 1)2sn2[z, ]i  = 0.

(10)

(11)

although the solutions of lame equation with period 4k() and 2k() are well-known,

solutions with other periods do not known yet [17]. since s(x) has period 2k()/(k), the

physically meaningful solutions of lame equation in this model are those whose periods are

2k()/(k)n, where n = 1, 2, 3,  . the eigenfunctions with period 2k()/(k) and their
corresponding eigenvalues are summarized at table i.

the -dependence of eigenvalues h0, h1, and h2 are shown at fig. 2. as shown in fig. 2

u0(x), u1(x), and u2(x) given at table i are the lowest three eigenstates of h. although the

existence of higher states is obvious, it is impossible to derive the eigenfunctions and their

eigenvalues analytically until now. however, the knowledge of the lowest three eigenstates is

sucient for the discussion of the eect of compactied spatial coordinate in the sphaleron

phase transition. note that h2 is very close to zero compared to h0 in the small  region.

we will show in the following that this eect guarantees the dierent types of sphaleron

transition in the small  region from that in large  region.

the nomalization constants c0, c1, and c2 dened at table i are easily derived by direct

calculation. since c1 is not needed for further discussion, we give only the explicit form of

c0 and c2:

(13)

ref. [11] has shown that the perturbation near sphaleron solution yields a sucient condition

for the sharp sphaleron transition. the explicit form of this sucient criterion is

1
b2 [l()  l(s)] < u0 | f [u0] > < 0.

(14)

where b is a small parameter, which is associated with small amplitude of periodic solution

whose center is s at quantum mechanical model, and s is sphaleron frequency

s  qh0 = 2"1 + 2

f [u0] in eq.(14) is dened as follows:

f [u0] =

reduces to

where

(17)

(18)

it is worthwhile noting that the only positive one in eq.(17) is i0(). now, it is clear why

small h2 in small  region changes the type of sphaleron transition to be sharp rst-order.

6

since 1/h2 is involved in i2() and it becomes large value in small  region, the dominant

contribution of the left-hand side of eq. (17) can be i2(), and hence rst-order transition

may take place.

now let us compute i0(), i2(), and j() explicitly. using a recurrence relation of

gn  r dusnn[u, ]

g2m+2 =

sn2m1[u, ]cn[u, ]dn[u, ] + 2m(1 + 2)g2m + (1  2m)g2m2

(2m + 1)2

it is straightforward to show

j() =

1058 h(48 + 162 + 174 + 246)k()  (48 + 402 + 404 + 486)e()i .

the -dependence of j() is shown in fig. 3. fig. 3 shows that j() in eq. (20) correctly

recovers the  = 1 limit of j(), 1083/702a2, which can be obtained easily by calculating

same quantity in the same model with non-compactied spatial coordinate.

now, let us compute i0(). using a recurrence relation of dn  r dudnn[u, ]
2dn2m[u, ]sn[u, ]cn[u, ]  2m2d2m1 + (2m + 1)(2  2)d2m+1

d2m+3 =

2(m + 1)

,

(22)

and identity 2sn2[u, ] + dn2[u, ] = 1, one can show straightforwardly

i0() = 

1522c 6
0

128a2h0 h5  18a + 24a2  16a3i2

.

(23)

once again one can see the correct  = 1 limit of i0(), 337523/40962a2 in fig. 3.

finally, direct computation of i2() yields

7

i2() = 

0 c 2

64a2 c 4

3h2  8h0
2h2(h2  4h0)

where

b =

(24)

(25)

the fact i2( = 1) = 0 as shown in fig. 3 means that there is no correspondent discrete

mode at  = 1. in fact, if one derives h in the same model with non-compactied space, it is

easy to show that h becomes usual poschl-teller type operator which has only two discrete

modes.

although it is impossible to calculate i4() analytically, we know that it is small negative

value, which results in the following inequality

1
b2 [l()  l(s)] < i0() + i2() + j().

(26)

fig. 4 shows -dependence of a2()
2c 4

0

(i0() + i2() + j()). eq.(26) and fig. 4 guarantee

the existence of c >  = 0.820621, which distinguishes the types of transition. as expected

this simple model exhibits a rst-order sphaleron transition in small  region and a second-

order sphaleron transition in large  region which can be expected from the result of  = 1

case. fig. 5 shows the numerical result of actions for the vacuum bounce and sphaleron

solutions in the compactied model. it is worthwhile noting that the dierence between two

action values becomes smaller and smaller when the circumference of the compactied spatial

coordinate decreases. this means the possibility for the occurrence of sharp transition is

enhanced in small  region, which is consistent with our main result.

from the result of this letter we expect the types of sphaleron transition in compactied

mw model are two kinds depending on its circumference as shown in fig. 6. fig. 6

(a) corresponds to small mh region in electroweak theory, and (b) to large mh region,

respectively.

if this is generic case, the mw model with compactied space can play an

important role as a toy model of electroweak phase transition. the thorough study on the

8

sphaleron phase transition in compactied mw model may yield some clues to the following

fundamental questions:

 why the type of electroweak phase transition is dependent on mh and mw ?
 what is the physical meaning of sharp transition in quantum tunneling regime for large

mh case?

sphaleron phase transition in mw model with compactied space and, if possible, an-

swers on these questions will be discussed elsewhere.

the fact that the dierence between two action values become smaller when the circumference of

in this gure p is period of classical conguration. if our conjecture is generic case, the mw model

in s1 can play a key role as a toy model for the study of electroweak phase transition.
