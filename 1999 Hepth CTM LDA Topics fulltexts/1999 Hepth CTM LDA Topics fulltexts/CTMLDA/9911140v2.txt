abstract

we perform canonical quantization of open strings in the d-brane back-

ground with a b-eld. treating the mixed boundary condition as a primary

constraint, we get a set of secondary constraints. then these constraints are

shown to be equivalent to orbifold conditions to be imposed on normal string

modes. these orbifold conditions are a generalization of the familiar orb-

ifold conditions which arise when we describe open strings in terms of closed

strings. solving the constraints explicitly, we obtain a simple hamiltonian for

the open string, which reveals the nature of noncommutativity transparently.

i. introduction

the open string gives rise to the noncommutative geometry [1] for the d-brane with a

ns-ns b-eld. the d-brane dynamics is described by yang-mills gauge elds on noncom-

mutative space-time. this point was implied in the work of connes, douglas, and schwarz

[2] on the matrix m-model [3] compactied on a torus in an appropriate limit. subsequently,

more direct approaches to the noncommutative geometry in the string theories were taken

in refs. [47], where the open string dynamics in the d-brane background are studied. the

various aspects of the noncommutative yang-mills gauge theories and their implications in

the string theories were discussed extensively in a recent work of seiberg and witten [8]. in

particular the equivalence of the ordinary gauge elds and the noncommutative gauge elds

has been proposed and checked by comparing the ordinary dirac-born-infeld theory with

its noncommutative counterpart for the d-brane.

in order to explore further the noncommutative geometry in the string and its nonpertur-

bative eects, we may need to develop the string eld theory based on the noncommutative

algebra. bigatti and susskind [5] also discussed recently relevance of the noncommutative

geometry in the light cone quantization of open strings attached to d-brane, which can be

easily extended to the light cone string eld theory. in this respect it is important to perform

canonical quantization of the open string theory in the background of d-brane, which will

be a stepping stone toward the second quantized theory. quantization of the open strings in

the presence of d-branes with a b-eld has been already discussed in the literature. in ref.

[9] it was pointed out that the nontrivial boundary condition in the presence of the b-eld

modify the canonical commutation relations and leads to the noncommutativity on d-brane

worldvolume. this point was elaborated further subsequently by chu and ho [10], as they

examine the simplectic form obtained in terms of the mode expansion of the classical solu-

tions. however, there are some discrepancy between two works. to resolve the discrepancy

the authors of both works perform the canonical quantization, treating the mixed boundary

condition as a primary constraint and employing the diracs quantization method. never-

2

theless, the discrepancy still remains. the purpose of this paper is to carry out the canonical

quantization of the open string in the d-brane background with some rigor and to clarify

the related problems. in the course we will be able to conrm some of the results obtained

in [8] by using the conformal eld theory.

ii. open string in the background of d-brane

the bosonic part of the classical action for an open string ending on a dp-brane with a

b-eld is given by

i =

1

4 zm

d2"ghh x 



x 

 + bij x i



x j

 #

(1)

where  = 0, 1, . . . , 9 and i = 0, 1, . . . , p. here we consider a simple at background rst:

g = , h = db = 0. extension to a more general background will be discussed later.

if the u(1) gauge eld on the dp-brane is present, (bij + fij) replaces bij in the action

eq.(1). for simplicity we set 2 = 1 and restore it when necessary.

choosing the metric as h =  = (, +), we nd the canonical momenta and the

hamiltonian as

p i =  x i  bi
2 (cid:16)p i + bi
h =

1

jx j, p a =  x a

jx j(cid:17)2

+

1

(p a)2 +

x x

where a = p + 1, . . . , 9. the boundary conditions to be imposed are as follows

x i  bi

j x j = 0, x a = xa

(2a)

(2b)

(3)

for  = 0, . in terms of the canonical momenta the rst boundary condition is written by

bi

jp j  m i

jx j = 0

(4)

where m i

j = i

j  bi

kbk

j. since the boundary conditions are nontrivial for x i, we will be

concerned only with x i hereafter.

3

we may incorporate the boundary condition eq.(4) into the canonical quantization,

treating it as a second class constraint. before going into the canonical quantization of the

open string in the d-brane background, it may be useful to recall the canonical quantization

of the free open string. the open string is often described as a closed string with an orbifold

condition

x i() = x i(), p i() = p i().

(5)

let us recast this procedure into the canonical quantization. the hamiltonian for the free

open string is given as

h =

2 h(p i)2 + (x i)2i =

1

2 z d
nein, p j = pn p j

where x i = pn x i

are imposed on x i

nein. (it is assumed that appropriate real conditions

n and p i

n.) the boundary conditions to be imposed on the two ends of open

1

2 xn

ij(cid:16)p i
np j

n + n2x i

n(cid:17)
nx j

string are as follows, x i(0) = x i() = 0. in terms of normal modes these boundary

conditions are rewritten as

i

1 = xn

nx i

n = 0,

i

1 = xn

n(1)nx i

n = 0.

(6)

viewing the boundary conditions as primary constraints, we nd that they generate the

secondary constraints

(7)

(8)

1 = {h, i
i

1}p b = xn

np i
n,

1 = {h, i
i

1}p b = xn

n(1)np i
n.

here the fundamental poisson brackets are given by

{x i

n, p j

m} = ijnm,

n, x j

m} = 0,

n, p j

{p i

m} = 0.

{x i
1 = 0 and i

the consistency requires that i

1 = 0. again in order to impose these secondary

constraints consistently we should introduce the following constraints

{h, i
{h, i

1}p b = xn
1}p b = xn

n3x i

n = 0,

n3(1)nx i

n = 0.

by repetition we get a complete set of constraints

m = xn
m = xn

m = xn

n2m1(1)nx i

i

m = xn

n2m1(1)np i

n = 0

(10a)

(10b)

where m = 1, 2, . . .. since they are of second class, one needs to construct the dirac bracket

to incorporate them into the canonical quantization. however, each constraint involves

all dierent modes, the dirac bracket is expected to be complicated. as for this point the

following simple observation turns out to be very useful. the set of the constraints, eq.(10a)

implies

(2m  1)!

x i
n

(in)2m1
(2m  1)!

= ixn xm=1

x i

it follows that

from eq.(11) and

i
n = x i

n  x i

n = 0, n = 1, 2, . . . ,

z 2

0

d


sin n sin m = (n  m)  (n + m).

(11)

(12)

(13)

we also see that if eq.(12) is imposed, the constraint equation, eq.(10a) {i
1, 2, . . .}, holds. thus, two sets of constraints are equivalent to each other. if we apply this
procedure to the constraints, eq.(10b) { i
m = 0, m = 1, 2, . . .}, we get the same result as
eq.(12). they do not introduce additional constraints, thus they are redundant. the same

n = 0, n =

procedure yields that the set of constraints {i
following set of constraints,

n = 0, n = 1, 2, . . .}, is equivalent to the

i

n = p i

n  p i

n = 0, n = 1, 2, . . .

(14)

and that the constraints eq.(10b) are redundant. at a glance we nd that these constraints

eqs.(12, 14) are nothing but the orbifold condition eq.(5), which introduced to describe the

open string in terms of the closed string.

5

now it becomes an easy task to construct the dirac brackets. we evaluate the commu-

tators between the constraints

n, j

{i

m}p b = 0,

{i

n, j

m}p b = 2ijnm,

n, j

{i

m}p b = 0.

introducing

c = 2


0

ij

ij 0




 i

where i is identity matrix, inm = nm, we construct the dirac bracket as

{a, b} = {a, b}p b  {a, m}p b(c 1)m n{n , b}p b

where m = {i

n, j

m}. the fundamental dirac brackets are obtained as

{xi, pj}p b = ij,

n, p j

{x i

m}db =

1
2

ij ((n  m) + (n + m))

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

where n and m are non-zero integers. all other fundamental dirac brackets are vanishing.

iii. canonical quantization and d-brane background

now let us return to the canonical quantization of the open string in the d-brane back-

ground with a b-eld. as in the case of the free open string, the boundary condition may be

treated as a primary constraints. in the presence of b-eld, we may expand the canonical

string variables in terms of normal modes as

x i() = ai( + c) +xn

x i

nein, p i() = xn

nein
p i

(19)

where c is a constant, which will be xed later. in the limit of strong b-eld, the dynamical

degrees of freedom of the open string are mostly encoded by ai [5]. in terms of the normal

modes the hamiltonian and the boundary conditions eqs.(2) read as

(20a)

(20b)

(20c)

here choose c = /2. note that the boundary conditions relate string coordinate variables
{x i

n} to the momentum variables, {p j
n}.
evaluating the commutator between the hamiltonian and the primary constraints,

{h, i

0}p b = xn

inp i
n,

we nd the secondary constraints, which are conjugate to the primary constraints i

0

i

0 = xn

np i

n = 0.

(21)

(22)

the dirac procedure requires further that the commutators between the secondary con-

straints and the hamiltonian are vanishing

{h, i

0}p b = ixn

n2(cid:16)bi

jp j

n  inm i

jx j

n(cid:17)

(23)

this procedure will be continued until it does not generate additional new constraints. by

repetition we get a complete set of constraints

(24a)

(24b)

where m = 0, 1, 2, . . .. these constraints are of second class. we also get a set of constraints,

which generated by i

0 and its commutator with the hamiltonian. but as in the case of the

free open string, they are redundant.

since each constraint involves all dierent normal modes, it is desirable to disentangle

them to construct the dirac bracket. as we observed before, the set of constraints {i
0, m = 0, 1, 2, . . .} is equivalent to

m =

7

{i

m = p i

m  p i

m = 0, m = 1, 2, . . .}.

(25)

by the similar procedure we disentangle the set of constraints {i
are lead to

m = 0, m = 0, 1, . . .}. we

it follows from

where pi = p i

0, and n = 1, 2, . . .. the rst constraint determines ai, ai = (m 1b)i

assuming that this solution is used explicitly, we will remove the constraint i

0 = 0 hereafter.

taking this into account we write

x i() = (m 1b)i

we note that (m 1b) is antisymmetric.

evaluating the commutators between the constraints, we have

these commutator relations agree with those obtained in the work of chu and ho [7,10].

iv. noncommutative geometry

it is desirable to solve the constraints explicitly if possible. the constraints are solved

explicitly, there is no need for the dirac brackets. dening

(p i

where n = 1, 2, . . ., we nd that the only nontrivial commutation relations are

n, y j

n

(m 1b)ijnm,

n, k i

{y i

m}db = ijnm,

(35a)

(35b)

(36)

and all other commutators are vanishing. the constraints eq.(25) and eq.(27b) are read as

y i
n =

1
in

(m 1b)i

jk j
n,

k i

n = 0.

(37)

using these constraints, we can get rid of y i

n, and k i

n in favor of y i

n and k i

n, which satisfy

the usual commutation relations. accordingly, the hamiltonian can be written in terms of

n and k i
y i

n as

n(m)ijy j

(38)

this is precisely the hamiltonian for a free open string in the space-time background, of

which metric is given by mij. thus, the hamiltonian can be written in terms of the usual

commutative algebra. the noncommutativity arises when we identify the space-time coor-

dinates of open strings as

x i() = xi + (m 1b)i

n sin n(cid:19) .

(39)

the obtained representation for the hamiltonian, eq.(38) and the string coordinate vari-

ables, eq.(39) reveals the nature of the noncommutativity in string theory. the open string

prefers (y i

n, k i

n) as canonical variables while the closed string prefers (x i

n, p i

n). thus, in the

presence of the d-brane with a b-eld, the interaction between the open and closed strings

10

are expected highly nontrivial. as we see, the noncommutativity is important not only in

the zero mode sector but also in all other nonzero mode sectors. this representation would

be useful when we discuss various stringy noncommutative eects.

in order to compare our results with those of seiberg and witten [8], we restore 2,

and take gij = gij. we also change the signature of the metric on the string worldsheet,

which takes that h = (+, +) and bij is replaced with ibij. following this prescription, we

get the hamiltonian and the boundary conditions as

thus, the obtained hamiltonian is precisely the hamiltonian for a free open string in space-

time with the metric given by (ge)ij as we may expect. concomitantly the spectrum of the

open string in the d-brane background is determined by the eective metric (ge)ij. as we
mentioned before, it is convenient to employ basis {|y i() >} to describe the open string,
interacting with the d-brane, while the usual basis {|x i() >} is more suitable for the
closed string. note that the eigenstate of x i(), |x i() > can be constructed as a coherent
state in {|y i() >}.
it is quite similar to the lowest landau level state. more detailed
discussion on this point will be given somewhere else [11]. in ref. [8], siberg and witten

discuss the zero slope limit, where   
2  0, gij    0 while keeping b, ge and 
xed. the zero slope limit does not alter the noncommutative structure, but it makes the

1

potential term dominant in the hamiltonian as in the lowest landau level. as we see even

in the zero slope limit the nonzero mode sectors contribute to the noncommutative d-brane

dynamics as well as the zero mode sector. the nonzero mode sectors would be important

to understand some stringy eects in the noncommutative geometry.

v. concluding remarks

we conclude this paper with a few remarks. we nd that the dynamics of d-brane

with a b eld can be understood in the framework of the canonical quantization. in the

presence of the b eld we have a mixed boundary condition, which generates an innite

number of secondary second class constraints. the set of the second class constraints is

shown to be equivalent to an orbifold condition, which is a generalization of the simple one

introduced when the free open string is described in terms of the closed string. the best

12

way to deal with the second class constraints is to solve them explicitly. indeed we can solve

the constraints explicitly without diculty and get a simple hamiltonian for the open string

in the d-brane background. the hamiltonian is found to be a free hamiltonian for an open

string in space-time with the metric ge eq.(41). noncommutativity arises as the orbifold

condition eectively reduces the phase space for the string by half. eq.(46) reveals the nature

of noncommutativity in string theory transparently. the present work may serve as stepping

stone leading us to various directions. the canonical analysis carried out in the present paper

may enable us to construct the second quantized theory for the open string in the d-brane

background, which would be an appropriate generalization of the earlier work on the open

string by witten [12]. we may also apply the same canonical quantization procedure to

the open string attached to the multi-d-branes or to two dierent types of d-branes. work

along this direction may improve our understanding of the ads/cf t correspondence [13]

and the black hole physics in string theory. in the due course one may attempt to derive

the (non-abelian) noncommutative dirac-born-infeld eective action [8,14] for the d-brane,

which remains to be an outstanding open problem.
