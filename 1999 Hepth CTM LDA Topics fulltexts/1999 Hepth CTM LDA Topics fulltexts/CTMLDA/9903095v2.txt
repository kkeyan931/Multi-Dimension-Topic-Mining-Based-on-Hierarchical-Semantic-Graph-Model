we investigate the role of massless magnetic monopoles in the n = 4 supersymmetric

yang-mills higgs theories. they can appear naturally in the 1/4-bps dyonic congura-

tions associated with multi-pronged string congurations. massless magnetic monopoles

can carry nonabelian electric charge when their associated gauge symmetry is unbro-

ken. surprisingly, massless monopoles can also appear even when the gauge symmetry

is broken to abelian subgroups.

recently there has been several activities in trying to understand multi-pronged strings ending

on parallel d3 branes in the type iib string theory [1]. 1/2 bps monopoles and w-bosons in

n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theories appear naturally as d-strings and fundamental strings

connecting parallel d3 branes in type iib string theory [2]. 1/4-bps multi-pronged string webs

have a natural interpretation in the n=4 supersymmetric yang-mills theories: they correspond to

the congurations of many dyons separated in some distance, balanced under the electromagnetic

coulomb force and more complicated higgs force [3]. when there are several dyons, the cong-

uration can be spherically symmetric for some cases and more explicit eld conguration can be

obtained [4]. the number of zero modes of these congurations is somewhat complicated [5, 1],

than the 1/2 bps monopole case [6]

for 1/4-bps congurations of dyons, only two independent components of six higgs elds in

n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory get involved [3]. in string picture, the eigenvalues of the

vacuum values of six higgs elds indicate the positions of d2 branes on the transverse 6-dimensional

space. the 1/4-bps congurations lies on a plane, forming a string web [1]. one component of

the higgs elds determines the masses of magnetic monopoles, and some of them can be massless.

as two independent higgs asymptotic values determine the symmetry breaking pattern, the gauge

symmetry corresponding to the massless monopole can be unbroken or broken. when the gauge

symmetry for the massless monopoles is not broken, they can not exist in isolation. but in pres-

ence of other massive magnetic monopoles, their presence can be felt. especially they can carry

nonabelian electric charge. when the gauge symmetry is completely broken, the corresponding

massless monopoles will become massive in isolation. thus, their appearance seems mysterious.

in this paper, we investigate in detail the physics of such massless monopoles in 1/4-bps dy-

onic congurations by employing a simple model. the simple model we study is based on the

congurations for three distinct monopoles when the gauge symmetry is broken from su (4) to
u (1)  su (2)  u (1) or u (1)3. we consider this model because it is easy to construct the bps
congurations by the adhmn method [7] and the partially broken limit of the conguration can

be easily explored.

there are several fascinating problems associated with monopoles when the unbroken gauge sym-

metry has a nonabelian subgroup. when massive magnetic monopoles carry nonabelian magnetic

charge, it is well known that one cannot dene the electric nonabelian transformations globally

around them, which is called the global color problem [8]. the main reason behind it is that

the inertia for some of global gauge transformations become innite. this is associated with the

fact that the corresponding zero modes are nonnormalizable. when there are several magnetic

monopoles so that the net magnetic charge is purely abelian, then one can dene the global color

1

transformations without such obstruction.

there is also the issue of massless monopoles. when the gauge symmetry is partially restored

from abelian group to nonabelian group, some of magnetic monopoles become massless. the idea

of such monopoles in isolation is meaningless: their size becomes innite and their eld strength

vanishes. however, it is known now that these massless monopoles can leave some footprints when

one start with several other monopoles [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. the physics of massless monopoles

becomes especially simpler when the net magnetic charge remain abelian. in this case massless

monopoles form magnetic cloud surrounding massive magnetic monopoles, and so the net magnetic

charge is abelian. in the massless limit, the dimension of moduli space does not change, but the

characteristics of moduli parameters for massless monopoles changes drastically. some of them

describe the orbit of unbroken electric gauge transformations, and the rest do the cloud shape

parameters [9]. when there are several identical massless monopoles, some of them can be taken

to the innity, making the net magnetic charge to be nonabelian. in this case the global charge is

not well dened, but there will be still some remaining cloud parameters.

when we consider a single higgs eld case, the magnetic monopole conguration describes 1/2-

bps states. the moduli space dynamics of the zero modes of three distinct fundamental monopoles,
when su (4) is broken to u (1)3, has been studied in dynamics detail in the moduli space approxi-

mation [14]. also, the moduli space of these monopoles when one for the middle root of the dynkin

diagram becomes massless has been studied [9]. more recently, the detail eld conguration of such

a system [13] have been obtained by using the adhmn construction [7]. its salient feature is that

four zero mode parameters for the massless monopole are composed of three su (2) gauge orbit

parameters and one gauge invariant parameter. the nonabelian cloud surrounding the massive

monopoles takes an ellipsoid shape, at whose two focal points lie two massive monopoles. the size

of the ellipsoid is the gauge invariant parameter.

as shown in ref. [3], 1/4-bps congurations for dyons have only two relevant components of six

higgs elds, i , i = 1, ..., 6. the bps energy bound is saturated when the several bps equations

are satised. they can be put into two bps equations,

bi = dib  ,
d2
i a    [b  , [b  , a  ]] = 0,

(1)

(2)

where ai and bi are two orthonormal vectors in 6 dimensions and decided by the electric and

magnetic charge vectors,

qm

i = 2z d3xi(trbii ),

2

(3)

qe

i = 2z d3xi(treii ).

(4)

it was shown that the the second bps equation is identical to the unbroken gauge zero modes for

the rst bps equation. the rst equation is solved in ref. [13]. to solve the second equation, we

follow the method in ref. [3].

to start, we assume that the asymptotic value of b   is diagonalized to be

b  () = diag(h1, h2, h3, h4) = h  h,

(5)

where we choose the gauge so that h1 < h2 < h3 < h4. the diagonal values are the coordinate

of d3 branes along the bi direction. in this case the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to
u (1)3. there exists a unique set of unit length simple roots, , ,  such that their inner product

with h in the root space is positive denite. we can choose the order so that

  h = diag(1/2, 1/2, 0, 0),
  h = diag(0,1/2, 1/2, 0),
  h = diag(0, 0,1/2, 1/2).

the masses of , , and  monopoles are 4 times

1 = h2  h1,
2 = h3  h2,
3 = h4  h3,

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

respectively. (here we put the gauge coupling constant to be unity.)

we consider three distinct fundamental monopoles, whose magnetic charge is

g = 4( +  + ).

(10)

in the limit 2 = 0, the electric gauge symmetry is partially restored to u (1)  su (2)  u (1).
in this limit the  monopole becomes massless and the above magnetic charge remain abelian as
g   = 0. from the rst bps equation, the magnetic charge is related to the asymptotic form of
b  ,

b   = b  () 

g  h
4r

+ o(cid:18) 1

r2(cid:19) .

(11)

similarly, the electric charge

q = q + q + q

(12)

3

is related to the the asymptotic form of a  ,

a   = a  () 

q  h
4r

+ o(cid:18) 1

r2(cid:19) .

(13)

one goal of this paper is to nd the electric charge q for the given magnetic charge conguration
and a  (). the asymptotic values b  () and a  () are the coordinate values of d3 branes
along the orthogonal directions bi an ai .

the eld congurations satisfying the rst bps equation has been obtained by weinberg and yi

in ref. [13]. let us review briey this derivation for the later sake. for this purpose, we put the

position of three monopoles at

r = (0, 0,
r = (r sin , 0, r cos ),

r),

r = (0, 0,

1
m

r),

(14)

(15)

(16)

where m = 1 + 3. the origin coincides with the position of the center of mass. the relative

positions of the  monopole with respect to two massive monopoles are

yl = r  r,
yr = r  r.

(17)

we call their magnitude yl, yr. in the limit where  monopole becomes massless, the unbroken

su (2) gauge invariant parameters are

r = |r  r|,
d = yl + yr.

(18)

(19)

r is the distance between two massive monopoles and d is the cloud parameter. for a given d,

the position of the massless monopole becomes two dimensional ellipsoidal surface. as shown in

ref. [13], the nonabelian component of magnetic charge becomes dipole-like outside this ellipsoid.

thus our conguration has a nonabelian ellipsoidal cloud surrounding the coulomb like nonabelian

source such that the total conguration is completely abelian. one could regard that the nonabelian

cloud as a reminiscent of the conning string of quarks in a meson of qcd. here it does not give

a linear potential, but neutralizes in the color magnetic charge.

from the asymptotic value of b  , we see three intervals [h1, h2], [h2, h3] and [h3, h4] for the
parameter t of the nahm equation. the nahm data, which is the solution of the nahm equation,

is

there are four independent solutions of v(t) and s2, s3 of eq. (25), which form four columns.

the rst two independent solutions are continuous solutions with s2 = s3 = 0. in the limit 2 = 0,

(35)

where i, j = 2, 3 and ,  = 1, 2 are column indices.

from these solutions for v(t) and s2 and s3, one can nd the higgs eld of the rst bps equation

by using the formula,

b  (r) = z h4

3s3.

(36)

the characteristic of this eld is discussed in ref. [13]. we note here that this solution has the

desired asymptotic form (11), once a further gauge transformation in su (4) is made.

the second bps equation can be solved by nding the zero modes corresponding to the global
part of the unbroken gauge group u (1)  su (2)  u (1). we use the strategy used in ref. [3].
in our context we need to nd an ordinary function p(t) for a given traceless diagonal matrix
q  h = diag(q1, q2, q3, q4). p(t) satises the ordinary equation

where

p(t)  w (t)p(t) + (t) = 0,

w (t) = tr 2a
(t) = q2tr 2a

1a1(t  h2) + tr 2a
1a1(t  h2) + q3tr 2a

2a2(t  h3),

2a2(t  h3).

the boundary conditions for p(t) are

p(h1) = q1 and

p(h4) = q4.

6

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

this boundary conditions can be obtained easily by taking the limit of the additional monopole

need for a single caloron to innity [3].

in the limit 2 = 0, the solution becomes considerably simplied. the solution is

p(t) =  q1 + b1(t  h1)

where

then the solution for the second bps equation is

(44)

in this paper we are not interested in the detail structure of the second higgs eld in nite region,

which is associated with the fact how d3 branes are deformed to have multi-pronged string shape.

instead we are interested in only the asymptotic behavior of the eld (r). by taking the similar

approach as in ref. [13], we can get the asymptotic form

where c = 2q1 +21b1q2q3. (the asymptotic behavior at spatial innity can be calculated along
a particular direction, say, along a region where e1yl/yl >> e3yr/yr. in this region, terms with
vanishing entry is of order 1/r2 or exponentially small.) one can easily show that this hermitian

matrix is traceless. this is the asymptotic form of the general solution for the second bps equation.

there are three independent choices of the charge diag(q1, q2, q3, q4) such that pi qi = 0, which
lead to three independent solutions, 1(r), 2(r), 3(r) for the second bps equation. a   is in
general a linear combination of these three solutions. for simplicity, we consider three cases where
a   to be proportional to i for each i = 1, 2, 3.

first one is the obvious one,

1 = b  (r).

in this case the asymptotic value 1()  b  (), so that four d3 branes will lie on a line.
the electric charge will be proportional to the total magnetic charge. the conguration becomes

1/2-bps rather than 1/4-bps.

the second case appears with the gauge symmetry being still broken to u (1)  su (2)  u (1).
however, parallel d3 branes do not lie on a line. in this case, the asymptotic form is

2 = diag(23,1  3,1  3, 21)

(48)

(49)

(50)

the electric charges depend only on the su (2) gauge invariant parameters d and r. there is

a global part of the unbroken local su (2) gauge group, which exchanges two middle diagonal

components. under this, the sign of the r term in q changes. (notice also that both  and 
electric charges are not invariant under the su (2) gauge transformations.)

when the cloud size is smallest so that d = r, q is equal to q or q, depending on this sign.

this is consistent with the view in ref. [13] that the massless  monopole lies on the top of the

 or  monopole in the minimum cloud size case. in the large d limit, there exist the critical

amounts of electric charges. similar to the su (3) case, when the electric charges exceed the critical

amounts, there is no 1/4 bps congurations because the electric repulsion overcomes the higgs

attraction.

the electric charge does not need to vanish even when all three monopoles are overlapped so

that d = r = 0 unless their core sizes are identical 1 = 3. when two massive monopoles are
overlapped so that r = 0, note that q is purely abelian as q   = 0.

the third case will be

3 = diag(0,1  3, 1 + 3, 0)

as a    3, the gauge symmetry is completely broken to u (1)3. hence, there are no massless
monopoles in isolation. naturally, there are two questions arising here. first is how to interpret the

above result. second is how to understand the existence of massless monopoles in the conguration.

we note that the electric charges given in the above equations depend on the position of the 

monopole. while the  monopole appears massless in the example, it position cannot be trans-

formed by unbroken abelian subgroup, contrast to the second case. however, the electric charges

shows the obvious symmetry along the rotation around the line connecting two massive monopoles,

as it depends only on yl, yr.

the reason for the  monopole being massless seems obscure in the eld theoretic picture, while it

is much more clear in the string picture. here, as one moves the positions of d3 branes or changes

electric charge, two vectors bi and ai change. the genuine symmetry restoration occurs when two

d3 branes overlap. on the other hand, a given magnetic monopole appears massless when the bi i

components for two d3 branes have identical value. thus the line connecting corresponding two

d3 branes is perpendicular to the bi vector.

to nd why the  monopole can appear massless in the eld theory picture, let us start from

a conguration for three massive ,  and  monopoles. when there are two higgs expectation

values which are not parallel, these monopoles are attracted to each other. let us put some electric

charges such that relative charges are not zero, and then three dyons have repulsive force between

them. they will be settled, separated in some distance. also the core of dyons gets larger. when

electric charges are increasing, two vectors ai and bi are transforming. if the condition is right, it

seems that any one of them appears massless as far as the rst bps equation is concerned. our

case corresponds to the case where the  monopole becomes massless.

however, we will argue that the  or  monopoles cannot appear massless in a nite region in

our case. for simplicity, consider just two  and  monopoles in the su (3) gauge theory. if the

 monopole becomes massless, the conguration has nonzero nonabelian charge as far as the rst

bps equation is concerned. this conguration, however, has no nonabelian cloud, and so the

conguration for the rst bps equation is independent of the position of the  monopole [15]. it

seems that the  monopole has disappeared. the solution to this paradox is that as far as we stay

in bps congurations, the  monopole can appear massless only when it goes to innity. this

can be easily seen from the string picture. this is the bergmans instability [1] where the three

pronged conguration becomes unstable.

in the eld theoretic term, the  electric charge (say

without  electric charge) keeps  and  monopoles separated in nite distance. once we change

the asymptotic higgs values so that the  monopole appears massless, the electric repulsion sends

9

the  monopole to innity. however, we can always have a massive  monopole in nite distance

once we consider non-bps congurations.

instead if we started with one  and two  monopoles, the  monopole can appear massless at a

nite region. in this system, the net magnetic charge is abelian as far as the rst bps equation is

concerned. the  monopole becomes nonabelian cloud surrounding the massive  monopoles. this

is the case considered in ref. [11]. the position of the massless monopole form an ellipsoid [12].

we expect that there are two independent solutions for the second bps equations in this case and

that the electric charges will depend on the the position of the apparently massless  monopole if
the gauge symmetry su (3) is broken to u (1)2. in string picture, one can see that the bergmans

instability does not set in. two d strings will connect three d3 branes in the letter v shape,

emerging from the middle d3 branes and the  monopole may appear massless because the bi

vector will emerge from the middle d3 brane to the middle point of the line connecting two end d3

branes. f strings will connect the two tip d3 branes. two tip d3 branes have the same coordinates

in bi i and so the  monopole appears massless. note that the relation between bps dyons in the

eld theory and d strings is not direct in 1/4-bps congurations.

in this letter, we have analyzed the role of massless monopoles in 1/4-bps congurations, which

are associated with multipronged strings. one insight obtained from this is that the positions of

massless monopoles can play the physical role. there are a few questions to remain. we do not

have a good understanding of some cases. for example, consider a case where the gauge symmetry

is maximally broken to abelian subgroup, and some of magnetic monopoles appear massless, but

that the net magnetic charge is not purely abelian.

if such a case is possible, the question is

that the global color problem seems to appear. this may need more careful understanding of the

massless limit [15]. there has been several works to understand the s-duality in case where there

are nonabelian massive magnetic monopoles [16] and also the dual version of massless monopoles.

our work may be helpful in this direction. for this we need to understand how to quantize the

classical congurations we have obtained. recently, the new way of obtaining the electric charges

has been obtained [17]. it would be nice to check our result by that method. finally, we believe

this work is a step toward to the understanding of the attractive forces between massive monopoles

via massless monopoles.
