abstract

we consider aspects of instanton dynamics in the large-n limit using the ads/cft
duality for d0/d4 bound states. in the supergravity picture of wrapped d0-brane world-
lines on d4-branes, we nd the single-instanton measure and discuss its dependence on
compactication nite-size eects, as well as its matching to perturbative results.
in
the non-supersymmetric case, the same dynamical eects that produce the theta-angle
dependence perturbatively in 1/n, render the instantons unstable, although approximate
instantons of very small size still exist.

the smeared d0/d4 black-brane supergravity solution can be interpreted as dual to
a eld theory conguration of an instanton condensate in the vacuum. in this case, we
derive a holographic relation between the bare theta angle and the topological charge
density of the instanton condensate.

1 introduction

as approximation schemes for gauge dynamics, instanton calculus [1] and t hoofts 1/n
expansion [2] do not seem to combine in a useful fashion. since eects of a charge k in-
stanton sector are of o(e82k/g2
) = o(en ), it would seem that they are always irrelevant
in the large-n limit unless they control the leading contribution to some observable (for
instance, because of supersymmetry non-renormalization arguments), or somehow the in-
tegral over instanton moduli space is ill-dened. such non-commutativity of the large-n
limit and the instanton sum is assumed to be behind well-known instances of theta-angle
dependence at perturbative order in the 1/n expansion, notably in the context of large-n
chiral dynamics [3].

on the other hand, it is known that some toy models [4] completely suppress instanton-
like excitations once the large-n limit has been taken. in other words, the eective action
resulting after large-n diagram summation does not support instantons any more. so,
one may wonder whether the large-n master eld always loses its discrete topological
structure. recently, the ads/cft correspondence of [5, 6] has provided a new set of non-
trivial master elds for some gauge theories. in particular, the theta-angle dependence
of n = 4 super yangmills (sym4) in four dimensions can be studied in the large-
n expansion via perturbative type iib string theory in ads5  s5.
it is saturated
by instantons, which appear in the supergravity description as d-instantons [7]. so, the
radical view that an instanton gas is incompatible with the large-n limit is not vindicated
in this case.

in this paper, we investigate these questions in a qcd cousin introduced by witten [8],
which admits a supergravity description of its master eld, while removing the constraints
of extended supersymmetry and conformal invariance. more precisely, we would like to
learn under what conditions some kind of topological congurations (instantons) still give
the leading semiclassical eects of o(en ), even after the planar diagrams have been
summed over. we shall focus on the most elementary case of the dilute limit, i.e. the
single-instanton sector.

one description of this theory is in terms of n d4-branes wrapped on a circle s1

 of
length , with thermal boundary conditions. at weak coupling, the low-energy theory
on the d4-branes is a perturbative ve-dimensional super yangmills theory (sym4+1),
which reduces to non-supersymmetric, su(n) yangmills theory in four euclidean dimen-
sions (ym4), at distance scales much larger than the inverse temperature t 1 = . since
ve-dimensional gauge elds originate from massless open strings, their coupling scales
as g2

5  gs  with gs = exp() denoting the string coupling constant. therefore, the

four-dimensional coupling at the cut-o scale t is given by g2  gs t .

the weak-coupling description of instantons in this set up is in terms of d0/d4-branes
bound states. due to the wesszumino coupling between the type iia ramondramond
(rr) one-form and the gauge elds on the d4-branes world-volume, lwz = cd0  f  f ,
a d0-brane inside a d4-brane carries the instanton charge. the action of an euclidean

 is

.

(1.1)

incidentally, this relation also xes the numerical conventions in the denition of the four-
dimensional coupling g. we have also introduced the standard notation for the large-n
t hooft coupling   g2n.
the moduli of these instantons are encoded in the quantum mechanical zero-modes of
the d0d0 and d0d4 strings. for a standard compactication, the d0-branes (i.e. the
instanton particles of the gauge theory) describe standard instantons of n = 4 sym4 (see
[9] for some generalizations). if the circle breaks supersymmetry, the instanton fermionic
zero modes should be lifted accordingly to mass of o(t ), and one should get essentially
a yangmills instanton with no fermionic zero modes. other one-loop eects would
incorporate the perturbative running of the coupling constant in the standard way.

the supergravity framework for sym4+1 at nite temperature is given by the black

d4-brane solution [8, 10]. the full metric in the string frame is:1

ds2 = h

(h d 2 + d~y 2) + h

h = 1  (r0/r)3.

(1.3)

there are two length scales associated with this metric: the schwarzschild radius, r0,
related to the hawking temperature t by t 1 =  = (4/3) r0 [h4(r0)]1/2, and the charge
radius rq4, given by

in the maldacena or gauge-theory limit, one scales   0 with r/ = u and r0/ =

is relevant. in the supergravity picture, the d4-branes have disappeared in favour of the
throat geometry xbb (1.2), i.e. we have no open strings and the description is fully gauge
invariant. the black-brane manifold xbb, with topology r2 r4  s4, has a boundary at
u =  of topology s1r4, which is interpreted as the sym5 space-time (the (, ~y) space).
the physical interpretation is that asymptotic boundary conditions for the supergravity
elds at u =  represent coupling constants of microscopic operators in the gauge theory
[6].
the same boundary conditions are satised by the extremal d4-brane metric with
thermal boundary conditions. this is the vacuum manifold, denoted xvac, with topology

1see, for example, [11] and references therein for a review of metrics relevant to this paper.

s1  r5  s4, obtained from (1.2) by setting u0 = 0, with xed . however, one can show
[8, 12] that xvac is suppressed by a relative factor of o(en 2
) with respect to xbb, in the
large-n limit. in other words, the o(n 2) actions satisfy

i(xbb)  i(xvac) = k n 2  v t 4 < 0

(1.6)

for any t > 0, with k a positive constant, i.e. there is no hawking-page transition [13, 8].
unlike the case of n = 4 sym4, the dilaton is not constant in the supergravity
description. it becomes strongly coupled at radial coordinates of order u  o(n 4/3/ ),
where one has e = gs (h4)1/4 = o(1). beyond this point, one should use a dual picture
in terms of a wrapped m5-brane in m-theory, i.e. a quotient of ads7  s4. for the
purposes of the discussions in this paper, we are studying the theory at xed energy
scales of o(1) in the t hoofts large-n limit, with xed  = g2n. therefore, such
non-perturbative thresholds eectively decouple in the regime of interest, and we shall
formally extend the d4-brane manifold all the way up to u = .
from a physical point of view, -corrections to the classical geometry pose a more
serious limitation to the supergravity description. the curvature at the horizon scales as
(u0 gs n )1/2  1, in string units, so that the supergravity description is accurate
only for large bare t hooft coupling   1. on the other hand, the glueball mass
gap [14] in this theory is of order mglue   1 = t , while inspection of the wilson
loop expectation value gives a four-dimensional string tension [15] of order    t 2,
i.e. hierarchically larger in the supergravity regime. this lack of scaling indicates that
the supergravity picture is far from the continuum limit of the ym4 theory, a suspicion
already clear from the existence of non-qcd states of kaluzaklein origin at the same
mass scale as the glueballs: mkk  t  mglue.

2 the localized instanton

the natural candidate for an instanton excitation in the large-n supergravity picture is
a d0-brane probe wrapped around the thermal circle. for the supersymmetric case, this
is indeed the t-dual conguration to the d-instantons in ads5  s5 discussed in [7].
wrapped d0-branes have the correct quantum numbers to be interpreted as yangmills
instantons in the eective four-dimensional theory. the topological charge is interpreted
as the wrapping number on the thermal circle s1
in the large-n limit, it is justied
.
to take the d0-brane as a probe, neglecting its back-reaction on the supergravity elds,
since the gravitational radius is sub-stringy: (rprobe)7   7/2 e  o(1/n), although for
instanton numbers of o(n) with identical moduli we may need a supergravity description
for the instanton dynamics in terms of the d0-branes near-horizon geometry (i.e. a t-
dual of the limit in [16], or the solution of section 3 below). we shall postpone these
interesting complications by working in the single-instanton sector, and with instanton
moduli of o(1) in the t hooft large-n limit.
one important ingredient of the the instanton/d0-brane mapping is a physical inter-
pretation in gauge-theory language of the wrapped d0 world-lines radial position. for

3

this purpose, we use the generalized uv/ir connection as discussed in [17]. according to
this, a radial coordinate u is associated to a length scale in the symp+1 gauge theory of
p+1 n/u5p. thus, in our case, the size parameter  of the instanton satises:

order  qg2

2 =

 
u

.

(2.1)

we will assume this relation as the denition of the instantons size modulus.

we will now discuss both manifolds with s1  r4 boundary conditions at u = ,
in spite of the fact that eq. (1.6) ensures the dynamical dominance of xbb. the reason
for considering also the vacuum manifold is rst that we nd interesting dierences
between the manifolds, and that xvac is the only relevant manifold for supersymmetric
compactication, with which we can make contact with the ads5  s5 case.

2.1 vacuum manifold
the s1 factor on the boundary extends to the bulk of xvac becoming singular as u  0,
u) = g  =  (h4)1/4  0. however, the action of the instanton is
since vol(s1
constant, due to the dilaton dependence in the diracborninfeld action:

sd0 = md0z 

0

d (gs e)g  =

82
g2 .

(2.2)

thus, the size  is an exact modulus in the supergravity description on xvac. on general
grounds, the path integral of a d-particle in a curved background x contains an ultralocal
term in the measure of the form dx  [det(g)]1/2, to ensure invariance under target-space
dieomorphisms. in the description of instantons on the manifold x, we concentrate on
the zero-mode part which then leads to a single-instanton measure

d (x) = cn, d zs1



s4


()5 dvol(x),

(2.3)

where d is the measure over fermionic zero-modes (sixteen in the supersymmetric case),
and cn, is a constant to be determined by the matching to the perturbative measure.
we have produced a measure in the physical space-time and scale-parameter space by
averaging over s1
. the result for xd4 = xvac, using the uv/ir connection (2.1) is:

  s4

d (xd4) = cn, 5 ( t )6 5 d d~y d.

(2.4)

we see that the presence of the dimensionful scale t explicitly violates the conformal
invariance of the measure, which we must take as a concrete prediction of the supergravity
approach. as such, it is valid at large n and .

the singularity of xvac as u  0 is not relevant. at u  us = t 1/3 the size of the
world-line is of o(1) in string units. so, for u  us we must use the t-dual metric of n
d3-branes smeared over the dual circle of coordinate length e = 42/:

the regime r  e we can approximate the discrete sum over images by a continuous
hand, for r  e we can instead neglect the images and approximate the sum by the
n = 0 term. the result is of course the standard ads5  s5 metric corresponding to
d3-branes at strong coupling. indeed, the uv/ir relation for d-instantons in d3-branes
[7],  = /u, matches the ve-dimensional one (2.1) precisely at u = uloc = 1/, which
is equivalent to r = rloc = e/42.

instantons in ads5  s5.
finally, as pointed out in the introduction, the validity of the supergravity picture is
limited by the requirement that we can control the -corrections. the curvature of the
d4-brane metrics is of o(1) in string units at the correspondence line uc  ( )1 [19].
for the d3-brane metrics, the condition is simply   1. this implies that, for  < , we
have a correspondence line for instanton sizes  = c =  . for  >  the correspondence
line is independent of  and lies at   1. below the correspondence line the system is
better described in yangmills perturbation theory, although we lose the analytic control
over the 1/n expansion.

[7] for d-

the geometrical d-instanton measure in ads5  s5 has been matched to the pertur-
bative instanton measure in the n = 4 sym4 theory in great detail, including multi-
instanton terms [20]. in particular, this allows us to x the coupling-dependent constant
as cn, = n 7/2 3/2. this is rather remarkable, since the geometrical measure holds at
large , whereas the perturbative measure is derived in yangmills perturbation theory,
valid for   1. this robustness of the instanton measure in this case might be due to the
high degree of supersymmetry and/or conformal symmetry. for instance, the analogous
matching between the d4-brane supergravity measure (2.4) and the perturbative descrip-
tion of the instanton particles of sym5, through the correspondence line  = c =  ,

2notice that the uv/ir connection (2.1) remains unchanged by t-duality, as the new metric only

diers by g   1/g  , with the u, ~y components of the metric unaected.

d-instantons is probably a consequence of conformal invariance.

this discussion may be summarized in fig. 1, where the nite-size transitions, as well
as the correspondence lines are depicted as a function of the t hooft coupling and the
instanton size.

2.2 black-brane manifold

although the wrapping charge of d0-branes is well dened in xvac, the thermal circle being
non-contractible, this is not the case for xbb, whose (, u) subspace has r2 topology.
therefore, the thermal circle at xed radial coordinate s1
u, is contractible, being the
boundary of a disc: s1
u = du, i.e. we can unwrap the d0-brane instanton through
the horizon. thus, while exact instanton charges can be identied in the supersymmetric
case, no quantized topological charge seems to survive in the non-supersymmetric case,
due to the dynamical dominace of xbb in the large-n limit (1.6).

still, we can talk of approximate or constrained instantons, provided the probe d0-
brane world-line wraps far away from the horizon. in this case the un-wrapping costs a
large action. in order to estimate the action as a function of u (or the instanton size ),
we calculate the diracborninfeld action of the probe d0-brane:

modulus, as instantons tend to grow. for an instanton of the order of the glueballs
compton wave-length   , the action is comparable to the vacuum action, and the
instanton has disappeared (un-wrapped).
in the far ultraviolet, we can use the approximate instantons of very small size   ,
to measure a running eective theta angle, by requiring that the approximate instanton
is weighed by a phase exp(ie ), with e(u = ) = , the bare theta angle of the four-
dimensional ym4 theory. following witten [21], a bare theta angle is associated to a rr
two-form

fd0 = dcd0 = 

3
 7 d  d,

where, in the notation of [21],  2 = u/u0, and  = 2 /. the bare theta angle, measured
at u = , is  =  (mod 2), due to the multiplicity of meta-stable vacua as described
in [21], i.e. fd0   = ( + 2n) in the n-th vacuum (see also [22] for another geometric
approach to this question). in what follows, we shall obviate this technicality by working
in the n = 0 vacuum, so that  = . the eective theta angle at throat radius u is

the correspondence line uc  ( )1 [19], controlling -corrections is also dened
in xbb. in terms of instanton sizes, for  < , we have a correspondence line at c =  .
since no instantons survive for  >  in the supergravity picture, the nite-size eects
related to t-duality in s1
 and localization eects are absent for xbb, i.e. there is no phase
of d-instantons in ads5  s5. the situation can be summarized by fig. 2.

3 the smeared instanton solution

in the previous section we have seen that probe d0-branes wrapping the thermal circle of
a black d4-brane in the far ultraviolet are dual to (unstable) small-size instantons. vice-
versa, there exists a dierent supergravity solution dual to a eld-theory conguration
which can be interpreted as containing a condensate of large instantons.

indeed, the smeared, black d0/d4-brane solution is interpreted (as in ref. [23] for
the supersymmetric t-dual case) to be dual to a yang-mills theory with a non-vanishing
self-dual background. the self-duality of the background implies that it can be related to
instantons, and the smeariness of the d0-branes can be interpreted very heuristically as
the fact that the instantons are smooth and then large.

in fact, in real time, the d0-branes are smeared on the d4-branes as soon as they
fall behind the horizon, due to the no-hair property (this corresponds u = u0 or, using
(2.1), to  = .) this statement has only a heuristic value because, in the euclidean
time congurations we are considering, space-time eectively ends at u = u0. still, the
eects of the source d0-branes can be detected on the long-range elds such as the metric,
dilaton, and rr elds. in this section, we pursue this view of the smeared d0-branes not
as probes, as in the previous section, but as background data.

the string-frame metric outside a system of k d0-branes smeared over the volume of

n d4-branes diers from that in (1.2) by one more harmonic function h0:

with c a known numerical constant. as before, a wrapped d0-brane probe can be used

where we have used u0 = 2t /9 + o(1/n 2), from (3.4). in interpreting this relation,
it is important to remember that we are working in the n = 0 vacuum, out of the o(n)
metastable vacua mentioned in section 2.2, i.e. the actual values of the parameters are
such that the r.h.s of (3.7) is smaller than 2.

equation (3.7) is a very suggestive relation, holographic in nature, in which the bare
theta angle is obtained in a mean-eld picture from the parameters of a kind of instanton
condensate. we should stress that (3.7) is only valid in the non-supersymmetric case.
the extremal (supersymmetric) solution has a non-contractible s1 so that we can add an
arbitrary harmonic piece to cd0, thereby changing the asymptotic value of  independently
of k and  (i.e. we cannot use stokess theorem as we do in (2.9) and (3.6)).

an interesting application of this connection is the computation of topological charge
correlations to the leading order in the large-n and large  limit. in view of (3.7), this
can be done by studying the -dependence of the vacuum energy of the ym4 theory (or
equivalently the thermal free energy of the sym5 theory.) for example, the action can
be calculated as i =  eym  sbh, with sbh = (ahorizon)/4g10 the black-brane entropy
and eym = madm  n v td4, the adm mass above extremality. one obtains

4 concluding remarks

within the ads/cft correspondence, the large-n master eld of the gauge theory is
encoded in the gravitational saddle-points of the supergravity description, subject to
boundary conditions.

in the model of ref. [8], which has a good supergravity description for large n and large
t hooft coupling  = g2n, there are two master elds, or generalized large-n saddle-
points, given by the two manifolds xvac and xbb, with s1  r4 boundary. we nd that
xvac supports instantons in the form of wrapped d0-branes, and leads to exponentially
suppressed theta-angle dependence, very much like in the ads5  s5 case, to which it is
dual through a set of t-duality and localization transitions that we discuss in some detail,
including the matching of the single-instanton measure.

however, xvac is only the dominant master eld in the supersymmetric case. the large-
n dynamics in the non-supersymmetric case is dominated by xbb, which does not support
nite-action topological excitations with the instanton charge. therefore, the dominant
master eld shows perturbative (in 1/n) theta-angle dependence, but has no instanton
topology, very much like in the two-dimensional toy models of refs. [4]. instead, we can
identify approximate (constrained) instantons of size   , merging with the vacuum
at sizes of the order of the glueballs compton wave-length   , which for this model
coincides with the kaluzaklein threshold.
the approximate equivalence of xvac and xbb in the ultraviolet regime u  , poses
the question of whether the approximate small instantons of xbb are really artifacts of the
regularization of the yangmills theory by a hot ve-dimensional supersymmetric theory.
unfortunately, this question cannot be settled with present techniques, since mglue  mkk
in the supergravity approximation,   1, and we lack a regime in which we could follow
the instantons as genuine four-dimensional congurations. it would be very interesting
to see if the non-supersymmetric gravity duals based on type 0 d-branes [27] provide a
more vantageous point to study this question.

heuristically, according to the uv/ir relation, an instanton of size    would be
associated to a d0-brane inside the horizon of the black d4-brane. because of the no-hair
properties, such a conguration would have the d0-charge completely de-localized over
the horizon (see [28] for a recent discussion in the extremal case). therefore, such cong-
urations should be interpreted as homogeneous self-dual backgrounds in the gauge theory,
and the supergravity description involves the smeared d0/d4 solution. although this

10

picture cannot be held literally in the euclidean solutions, which lack an interior region
behind the horizon, we can still identify the rr two-form generated by the d0-branes
dissolved in the d4-brane horizon. this rr ux is in turn responsible for the genera-
tion of a theta angle, via the ads/cft rules of [6]. therefore, we obtain a holographic
relation between the theta angle and the smeared instanton charge. although the general
relation between background elds and theta angle is not new (see [29, 4] for explicit
two-dimensional examples), we nd it interesting that in our case the background eld
is explicitly associated to an instanton condensate, with quantized topological charge
(equal to the number k of smeared d0-branes). this is reminiscent of the instanton liquid
models, where the instanton density is xed self-consistently (see for instance [30]).
