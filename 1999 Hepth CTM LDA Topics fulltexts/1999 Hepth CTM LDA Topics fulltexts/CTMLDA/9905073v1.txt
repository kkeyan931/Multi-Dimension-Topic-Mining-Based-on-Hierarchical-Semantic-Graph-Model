abstract

we propose a method to investigate the conservation of brane charges at the

intersection of two or more branes using the thom classes of their normal bundles.

in particular we nd a relation between the charge of the branes involved in the

conguration and the charge of the defects on the branes due to the intersection.

we also explore the applications of our method for various brane intersections in

type ii strings and m-theory.

1. introduction

one of the most remarkable properties of branes is that they can end or inter-

sect with others [1,2,3,4]. the arguments that lead us to believe that this is the

case are either based on brane charge conservation [2,5] or the analysis of the cou-

plings of brane eective theories. in same cases, this can also be achieved by direct

construction like in the case of fundamental strings which can end on d-branes (for

a review see [6]). all these arguments are of course related. the conservation of

brane charge method has been tackled by townsend using a deformation argument

which is known as brane surgery [5]. this argument is based on the existence of

chern-simons terms in supergravity theories, the use of their eld equations and

certain assumptions about the behaviour of the supergravity gauge potentials near

the intersection of two or more branes. one of the advantages of brane surgery is

that it applies for branes in a curved background. in the context of eective brane

worldvolume theories, the brane intersections or boundaries are thought in a way

similar to the interactions of particles in standard quantum eld theory. so, the

conservation of brane charges in this approach corresponds to the conservation of

particle charges at the interactions vertices of the eective brane theory.

from the (worldvolume) perspective of the branes involved in an intersection or

a boundary, the intersection or the boundary is described by a defect. this defect

can be viewed as a soliton like object and its charge can be measured on each

brane involved in the conguration [4]. one expects that the charges of the defects

and the charges of the branes of the conguration are related amongst themselves.

to derive such relations, one rst uses the fact that these defects have a brane

interpretation so they are usually called worldvolume branes or brane worldvolume

solitons. the brane surgery method of [5] then provides a relation amongst the

charges of the defects and the charges of the branes of the conguration.

in this paper, we shall propose another way to describe the brane charge con-

servation at the intersection or boundary of two or more branes. our construction

is based on the thom classes (e) of vector bundles e and their properties. in

2

particular, we view p-branes as (p+1)-dimensional submanifolds bp in the space-

time m which asymptotically behave as their associated supergravity solutions.

their charge is then computed by integrating an appropriate form eld strength

at a sphere at innity. we shall see that this is the same as evaluating the thom

class (n(p)) of the normal bundle n(p) of bp in the spacetime m; this has also
been proposed by witten in [7]. next using the properties of thom classes, if two

branes bp and bq intersect on zk = bp  bq, (dimzk = k + 1), we shall establish

the relation

q(p)q(kp) = q(q)q(kq) ,

(1.1)

where q(p) is the charge of the p-brane, q(q) is the charge of the q-brane, q(kp)
is the charge of the k-brane defect zk on the p-brane and qkq is the charge of

zk on the q-brane. the charges q(kp) and q(kq) are associated with the thom
classes of the normal bundles of zk in bp and bq, respectively. the above relation

among the various charges has two implications the following:

(i) the charges of the k-brane defect as measured on the p-brane and on the q-

brane are proportional to the number of q-branes and the number of p-branes

involved in the conguration, respectively.

(ii) there is a relation between the units that one measures the charges of the

defects with those of the p-and q-branes.

we shall explore the relation (1.1) amongst the charges for various boundaries

and brane intersections in strings and m-theory. in particular, we shall nd that

the unit of the charge of the boundary of a fundamental string ending on a d-brane

is proportional to the fundamental string tension. similarly, the unit of the charge

of a m-2-brane ending on a m-5-brane is proportional to the m-2-brane tension. we

shall also nd that in some cases the charges of the defects on intersecting branes

are related to the euler number of certain vector bundles. in addition, our method

can be used to investigate charge conservation for intersections that involve three

or more kinds of branes; we shall demonstrate this for a triple m-brane intersection.

3

this letter has been organized as follows: in section two, we use thom classes to

describe brane charge conservation for intersecting branes and derive the equation

(1.1). in section three, we apply our formalism to investigate the conservation of

charges in type ii intersections. in section four, we investigate charge conservation

in m-brane intersections, and in section ve we present our conclusions and remark

on the application of our results in the context of supergravity solutions with the

interpretation of intersecting branes.

2. brane charges and thom classes

2.1. the p-brane charge

spacetimes with a p-brane interpretation have an asymptotic region which is
isomorphic to r(1,p)  rdp1, where r(1,p) are the worldvolume directions and
rdp1 are the transverse or normal directions of the p-brane [8]. this is the so

call spatial transverse innity which can be thought of as the spatial innity of the

spacetime far away from the location of the brane. any p-brane in a d-dimensional

spacetime has an associated (d  p  2)-form eld strength f . the charge qp per

unit volume (in some frame) of the p-brane can be computed by evaluating f at
a sphere sdp2  rdp1 at innity as

qp =

1

vol(sdp2) z

f ,

sdp2

(2.1)

where vol(sdp2) is the volume of the unit sdp2 sphere. typically, the asymp-
totic behaviour of f in some angular coordinates in rdp1 is

f = 

qp

(d  p  3)

 d

1

rdp3

(2.2)

as r  , where r is the radius and the hodge star is that on rdp1.

4

an alternative way to compute the charge of a brane is to observe that

df = qp(r)

(2.3)

where  is a (d  p  1)-form with support at r = 0. so we can compute qp by
integrating df over rdp1, i.e.

qp = z

rdp1

df .

(2.4)

there is a geometric way to view this calculation. for this let us identify the p-

brane as a submanifold bp of the spacetime m. the normal bundle n(p) of bp in
m is dened as

t bp  t m|bp  n(p) .

(2.5)

so at the transverse spatial innity, n(p) = r(1,p)  rdp1. the form df can be
thought of as a (d  p  1)-form on n(p) which has support at the zero section of
n(p). in addition, the computation of charge of the p-brane above can be thought
of as the integration of df along a bre rdp1 of n(p).

for every rank n vector bundle e over a manifold s, the thom class



, (e),

of e is a (smooth) n-form in (e) which has the following properties:

(i) the integration of (e) along any ber of e gives one.

(ii) (e) has support very close to the zero section of e.

we shall not give the details of the construction of the thom class (e) of e.

this is explained in [9]. the thom class of the normal bundle n(p) of a submanifold
bp in m is the poincare dual of bp.

now we shall take df to be in the (cohomology) class of (n(p)) of the normal
bundle n(p) of the p-brane bp in the spacetime m. for this we appropriately

 we assume that the manifolds and the vector bundles involved are oriented.

5

rescale (n(p)) such that integration of (n(p)) over the bers of n(p) gives at
transverse spatial innity the charge qp of the p-brane. the use of the thom class

(n(p)) instead of df to compute the charge
following:



of a p-brane has two advantages the

(i) the charge per unit volume of a p-brane can be computed not only at the

transverse spatial innity but at any point on the brane bp.

(ii) the thom class (n(p)) need not satisfy the supergravity eld equations.
instead it is sucient to assume that there is a representative in the class of

(n(p)) that obeys the supergravity eld equations.

the latter point allows the computation of the charges at brane intersections to

be independent from the details of the dynamics. in the remaining sections, we shall

use the properties of the thom classes to investigate the charges of worldvolume

brane defects of intersecting branes.

2.2. intersecting branes

the typical set up of an intersecting brane conguration is that of a p-brane,

bp, and and a q-brane, bq, intersecting on a k-brane zk = bp  bq in a spacetime

m. now since the defect zk has a brane interpretation as viewed from the world-

volume perspective of both the p-brane and the q-brane, we shall use the thom

classes of the normal bundles of zk in bp and in bq to compute its charges. for

this, let (n(p)) and (n(q)) be the thom classes of the normal bundles n(p) and
n(q) of the p-brane and the q-brane in the spacetime m, respectively. far away
from the q-brane, the charge qp of the p-brane can be computed as in the previous

section by integrating the thom class (n(p)) along a bre of the normal bundle
n(p). since this can be done at any point in bp, we can also evaluate the charge

 one may wonder whether it is possible instead of the thom class of np that is associated
with df to use another class on np that is associated with f for the computation of the
charge everywhere on a p-brane. however, no such class exists for np unless its euler class
vanishes [9].

6

of the p-brane at a point in the intersection zk. however at the intersection zk of

the p-brane with the q-brane, the normal bundle of the p-brane splits



as

n(p)|zk = n(p+q)|zk  n(kq)

(2.6)



where n(p+q) = nbpbq is the normal bundle
and n(kq) is the normal bundle of zk in bq. this decomposition of n(p)|zk can
be seen by observing that zk is a submanifold of bq and so nkq is a subbundle
of n(p)|zk. using the above splitting of n(p) and the properties of thom classes,
we can write

of bp and bq in the spacetime m,

(n(p)|zk) = (n(p+q)|zk )  (n(kq)) .

in turn, this implies that

q(p) = q(p+q)q(kq) ,

(2.7)

(2.8)

where q(p+q) is interpreted as the charge of the whole conguration and q(kq)
is interpreted the charge of the k-brane worldvolume defect from the perspective

of the q-brane. repeating the same argument for the q-brane, we nd that

q(q) = q(p+q)q(kp)

(2.9)

where q(kp) is the charge of the k-brane worldvolume defect from the perspective
of the p-brane. eliminating q(p+q), we nd

q(p)q(kp) = q(q)q(kq) .

(2.10)

we have now derived the equation (1.1) of the introduction. the charge q(p) can
be written as

q(p) = (p)np

(2.11)

where (p) is the unit of charge of the p-brane and np  z is the number of p-branes

 more precisely, we have n(kq)  n(p)|zk  n(p+q)|zk .
 the bre directions of this bundle are the overall transverse directions of an intersecting

brane conguration in the terminology of [4].

7

of the conguration. similarly, we can write q(q) = (q)nq for the q-brane. the
equation (2.10) is valid for any number of p- and q-branes. this implies that

q(kp) = (kp)nq

q(kq) = (kq)np ,

(2.12)

and

(p)(kp) = (q)(kq) ,

(2.13)

where (kp) and (kq) are the units of charges of the k-brane worldvolume
defects on the p-brane and the q-brane, respectively. from these it is clear that

the charge of the k-brane defect on the p-brane is proportional to the number of q-

branes, and similarly the charge of the k-brane defect on the q-brane is proportional

to the number of p-branes of the conguration. this in fact is what one naively

expects in the context of defects which are associated with brane intersections.

the above computation can be easily extended to intersections that involve

more than two kinds of branes. we shall not attempt to give the general analysis

here. instead, we shall nd the relations amongst the charges associated with a

triple m-brane intersection in an example below.

3. intersections in string theory

all the brane intersections in string theory can be derived from brane intersec-

tions in m-theory using s- and t-dualities. nevertheless, some features of brane

intersections can be better understood in the context of string theory. we shall be

concerned with the class of intersections which involves two kinds of branes. our

intention is not to give a complete treatment of all possible brane intersections

in string theory but it is rather limited to present some examples of the method.

from these it will become clear how one can investigate any brane intersection in

this way.

3.1. fundamental strings ending on d-branes

one of the most well studied boundaries is that of a fundamental string ending

on a d-p-brane for p  6. using (2.10) for p = p and q = 1, we nd that

q(p)q(0p) = q(01)q(1) .

(3.1)

for p = 0, the thom class of n(00) can be taken to be the zero form which implies
that the charge q(00) vanishes. the equation (3.1) remains consistent provided
q(01) = 0 and so one concludes that within this formalism fundamental strings
cannot end on a d-0-brane in agreement with [5]. the equation (3.1) for p = 1

adapted for the units of charges reads



(1d)(01d) = (01n s)(1n s) .

(3.2)

this is the case of a string junction [10]. it is natural to identify (01d) with
the unit of charge of the born-infeld eld of the d-string. to nd the unit of this

charge, we rst note that the d-string tension



t(1d) in the presence of constant

born-infeld eld f = f01 changes as

t(1d) +

1
2

(1n s)

gs

(2)2f 2 .

(3.3)

this follows from the born-infeld action of a d-string; a similar calculation has
been done in [11] for  = 1. on the other hand the tension of a state involving a

 we shall add the subscripts n s and d with the obvious interpretation whenever it is

necessary to avoid confusion.

 we use the string frame relation t(p) = ga

s (p) between the tension t(p) and the unit of
charge (p) of a p-brane, where gs is the string coupling, a = 0 for fundamental string,
a = 1 for d-p-branes and a = 2 for ns-5-branes. in the conventions of [13], (p) =
(2)p()

p+1

2 .

9

d-string and a ns-string is

(1n s)(cid:0)1 + g2
s (cid:1)

1

2 = (

1
gs

+

1
2

gs)(1n s) + o(g3

s) .

(3.4)

from the above two equations at small string coupling, we nd that

(01d) = f = gst(1n s) .

substituting this into the equation (3.2), we get

(01n s) = gst(1n s)

.

(3.5)

so the defect on the fundamental string has unit charge proportional to its tension.

this may have been expected since the defect is a domain wall [12].

for the rest of the cases, we remark that the units of charges of d-p-branes [6,

14, 13, 15] are related by the equation

(p) =

1
2

(1)(p2) .

using this equation and (2.13) for p = p, q = 1 and k = 0, we nd that

(01) =

1
2

(p2)(0p) .

(3.6)

(3.7)

we proceed by observing that the right hand side of (3.2) is t-duality invariant

provided that it is performed in directions orthogonal to the string. however, the

left hand side changes according to the familiar t-duality rules for d-branes (for

the t-duality rules of the defects see [16]). moreover, the fact that in all cases the

defect on the fundamental string is a domain wall suggests that (3.5) is valid for

1
(p2). this expression
0 < p  6. using these, we nd that (0p) = 2gs(1n s)
for (0p) can also be directly computed in a way similar to that for p = 1 above.

10

3.2. three-brane solitons in type iia

in type iia, (i) two (non-parallel) ns-5-branes



and (ii) a ns-5-brane and a

d-4-brane intersect on a three-brane soliton defect. we shall postpone the investi-

gation of (i) as well as that of the associated via t-duality intersection in type iib

for later. this is because these intersections are similar to that of two m-5-branes

intersecting on a three-brane. so all the details will follow from the investigation

of this intersection in m-theory.

applying (2.10) for the intersection of a ns-5-brane and a d-4-brane on a

three-brane, we nd

q(5)q(35) = q(34)q(4) .

(3.8)

the unit of charge of the ns-5-brane and with that of d-4-brane are related [14,

15] by

(5) =

1
2

(0)(4) .

substituting this equation into (2.13) for p = 5, q = 4 and k = 3, we get

1
2

(0)(35) = (34) .

(3.9)

(3.10)

if in addition we take (34)  (4), because the 3-brane defect is a domain wall
in the d-4-brane, then (35)  (4)1
(0).

3.3. two-brane solitons in type iib

in type iib, a d-3-brane intersects with a ns-5-brane on a 2-brane. using

 cancellation of anomalies in the eective theory of ns-5-branes requires that the euler

number of the normal bundle of iia ns-5-branes vanishes [7].

11

(2.10) for this intersection, we nd that

q(5n s)q(25n s ) = q(23d)q(3d) .

(3.11)

the unit of charge of iib ns-5-brane and that of d-string are related [14, 15] as

(5n s) =

1
2

(1d)(3d) .

(3.12)

substituting this equation into (2.13) for p = 5, q = 3 and k = 2, we get

1
2

(1d)(25n s ) = (23d)

(3.13)

and thus we establish that the unit charge of 2-brane defect on the ns-5-brane and

the unit of charge of 2-brane defect on the d-3-brane are related via the unit of

charge of d-string.

finally in type iib a ns-5-brane and a d-5-brane intersect on a 2-brane. for

this intersection, (2.10) becomes

q(5n s)q(25n s ) = q(25d)q(5d) .

(3.14)

the unit of charge of ns-5-brane and that of d-5-brane are related [14, 15] as

(5n s) =

1
2

(1d)(5d) ,

(3.15)

which upon substitution in (2.13) for p = 5, q = 5 and k = 2 leads to

1
2

(1d)(25n s ) = (25d) ,

(3.16)

where (1d) is the unit of charge of iib instanton.

12

4. m-branes

the are two types of brane intersections [4, 17] in m-theory



. the rst is

that of a membrane ending on a m-5-brane with defect a (self-dual) string. the

other is that two non-parallel m-5-branes intersecting on a 3-brane. the latter

intersection is part of a more general intersection rule which states that two non-

parallel p-branes intersect on a (p-2)-brane. there is a large number of triple

m-brane intersections. here we shall not do a systematic investigation of triple

intersections. instead, we shall examine the case of two (non-parallel) membranes

ending on a m-5-brane.

4.1. membranes ending on m-5-branes

the defect on a m-2-brane ending on a m-5-brane is a string. this defect from

the perspective of the m-5-brane is the self-dual string while from the perspective

of the m-2-brane is a boundary. applying (2.10) in this case for p = 5, q = 2 and

k = 1, we nd

q(5)q(15) = q(2)q(12) .

using the relation (5) = 1
that of m-2-brane [14, 15], we can rewrite (2.13) adopted to this case as

2 ((2))2 of the unit of charge of the m-5-brane

(12) =

1
2

(2)(15) .

(4.1)



and

(4.2)

therefore, the unit of charge (12) of the defect on the m-2-brane is proportional
to the unit of charge charge of the m-2-brane as it is expected for a domain wall.

we remark that in this method the charge of the string defect on the m-5-brane is

not naturally associated with a self-dual three-form as it may have been expected.

however since the value of the charge depends only the cohomology class of the

form eld strengths, there may be a self-dual representative of this class.

 in fact there is a third non-standard type of string intersection that of two m-5-branes

intersecting at a string [18].

 the tension of m-branes in the conventions of [13] is t(2) = (2) = 2m3

p and t(5) = (5) =

2m6

p, where mp is the eleven-dimensional plank mass.

13

4.2. the 3-brane worldvolume soliton

the relation (2.10) of the various charges in the case of two non-parallel m-5-

brane intersecting on a 3-brane defect is

q(5)q(35) = q

(5)q

(35) ,

(4.3)

where q(5) and q
q(35) are the charges of the 3-brane defects, respectively.

(5) are the charges of the two 5-branes and q(35) and q

(35) =

to explore further the intersection of two m-5-branes on a 3-brane defect let us

we assume that q(5) = q
as

(5) and that the normal bundle n(5) of b5 can be written

n(5) = e  h

(4.4)

where e is a rank two bundle and h is its compliment in n(5). then the intersection
can be described as follows: we rst identify the m-5-brane b5 as the image of the
zero section of e while we identify the second m-5-brane b
5 as the image of as a
generic section s of e, i.e. b
5 are in general position, then
they intersect transversaly in e. the 3-brane defect from the perspective of b5 is

5 = s(b5). if b5 and b

the zero locus z of the section s, i.e. z3 = b5  s(b5). the normal bundle of z3 in

b5 is e and in this case the thom class of e can be identied with its euler class
e(e). so the charge q(35) = q
(35) can be identied with the euler number of
e in some units.

4.3. the 0-brane worldvolume soliton

the method of relating the charges of various worldvolume defects associated

with brane intersections can be easily generalized to intersections that involve

three or more branes. as an illustration we shall describe brane surgery for a

14

conguration for which the associated orthogonal m-brane intersection is

m5 :0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, , , 

m2 :0, 1, , , , , 6, , 

(4.5)

m2 :0, , 2, , , , , 7,  .

we dene z1 = b2  b5, z1 = b2  b5 and z0 = z1  z1 = b2  b2  b5. in

such conguration the normal bundles of the m-branes involved in the intersection

split as follows:

n(2)|z0 = n(15)|z0  n(12)|z0  n(2+2+5)|z0

n(2)|z0 = n(15)|z0  n(12)|z0  n(2+2+5)|z0

n(2)|z0 = n(02)  n(1+15)|z0  n(2+2+5)|z0

(4.6)

n(2)|z0 = n(02)  n(1+15)|z0  n(2+2+5)|z0

n(5)|z0 = n(12)|z0  n(12)|z0  n(2+2+5)|z0 .

in addition we have

n(15)|z0 = n(01)  n(1+15)|z0

n(15)|z0 = n(01)  n(1+15)|z0

(4.7)

n(05)|z0 = n(01)  n(01)  n(1+15)|z0 .

the rst two of above three decompositions can be understood by viewing the

strings z1 and z1 as branes within the m-5-brane. the above decompositions of

the normal bundles lead to the following relations amongst the brane charges:

q(2) = q(15)q(12)q(2+2+5)

q(2) = q(15)q(12)q(2+2+5)

q(2) = q(02)q(1+15)q(2+2+5)

(4.8)

q(2) = q(02)q(1+15)q(2+2+5)

q(5) = q(12)q(12)q(2+2+5) ,

15

and

q(15) = q(01)q(1+15)

q(15) = q(01)q(1+15)

q(05) = q(01)q(01)q(1+15) .

using the above relations, we nd

q(5)q(05) = q(02)q(2)

q(5)q(05) = q(02)q(2) ,

which leads to

q(5)q(05) = (cid:0)q(02)q(02)q(2)q(2)(cid:1)

1
2 .

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

this relates the charges of the defect as measured on membranes and m-5-brane

with the charges of membranes and m-5-brane involved in the conguration. the

above computation can be easily extended to many other triple brane intersections.

5. concluding remarks

we have proposed a method to investigate charge conservation at the intersec-

tion of two or more branes based on thom classes. we have found that this has

led to a relation between the charges of the branes involved in the intersection and

those of the associated worldvolume defects. we have then explored these relations

for various brane intersections in strings and m-theory.

some brane intersections preserve a proportion of spacetime supersymmetry.

this can be incorporated in our brane surgery construction by imposing additional

restrictions on the spacetime and the submanifolds associated with the various

branes. for example, one can introduce a supersymmetry projection operator at

every point in the submanifold associated with a brane in a way similar to that of

[19] and then ask whether there are killing spinors that satisfy all these projections.

however as we have seen brane charge conservation can be investigated without

the additional restriction of supersymmetry

16

it is natural to ask whether there are solutions in the literature that satisfy all

the requirements necessary to establish the above relations amongst the charges of

the branes and those of the defects. this is related to the question of localization

of the brane intersection solutions. it has been observed in the beginning of con-

struction of supergravity solutions with the interpretation as brane intersections [4,

20] that they are smeared along their relative transverse directions and that their

asymptotic behaviour does not have the desired power decay law with respect to

some radial coordinate. the latter leads to problems for calculating the charges

at innity of the associated branes. thus such intersections are geometrical and

there is no defect on either brane involved in the intersection. subsequent improve-

ments in the solutions by adding dierent harmonic functions for each intersecting

brane [17] have not resolve the problem. more recently solutions [21, 22, 23, 24]

have been found using the so called generalized harmonic function equations rst

proposed in [25]. such solutions exhibit a partial localization at the intersection.

however, their associated form-eld strengths do not have the desirable asymp-

totic behaviour required for the evaluation of brane charges. because of these and

other arguments, it was suggested in [26] that for many intersecting brane con-

gurations there are not exit solutions which are completely localized. however

it may simply be that supergravity solutions that exhibit charge conservation at

brane intersections are not simply constructed from harmonic functions and their

(straightforward) generalizations. so it appears that new methods should be de-

veloped to solve the supergravity eld equations like those for bps monopoles in

gauge theories.
