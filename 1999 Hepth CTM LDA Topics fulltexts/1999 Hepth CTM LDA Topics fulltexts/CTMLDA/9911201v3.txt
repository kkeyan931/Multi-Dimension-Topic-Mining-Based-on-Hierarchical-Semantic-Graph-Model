the type-iib string theory has the sl(2; z) duality [1]. various branes entering in
the theory belong to sl(2; z) multiplets. among various type-iib branes d3-brane is
something special. it is an sl(2; z) singlet and carries the charge of the background
4-form with self-dual eld strength. furthermore it may also play a fundamental role in
f theory. f theory is a conjectural theory in 12 dimensions, which explains the sl(2; z)
duality from a geometric viewpoint [2]. an idea that f theory is a theory of 3-brane
propagating in 12 dimensional spacetime has been proposed [3, 4, 5]. if such an idea is
valid, the theory of d3-brane with a manifest sl(2; z)-covariance may be a crucial step
toward the construction of the theory of f3-brane.

sl(2; z)-covariant type-iib p-branes have been considered by various authors [6, 7,
8, 9, 10].
in the cases of p > 1, an important problem is the number of degrees of
freedom. d-branes collective coordinates include, in addition to the embedding elds
into the target space, a vector eld propagating in the worldvolume. to construct an
sl(2; z)-covariant theory one needs to introduce sl(2; z) doublet worldvolume vector
elds, but as a consequence of this procedure one ends up with too many physical degrees
of freedom. to resolve this problem, these 2 vector elds must not be independent;
they should be related to each other under the electro-magnetic duality. one of the
methods which realize the electro-magnetic duality is the so-called pst formalism [11,
12, 13]. starting from the bosonic sector of the pst type m5-brane action [14, 15],
nurmagambetov constructed an sl(2; z)-covariant d3-brane action [9]. 1

nurmagambetovs model, however, includes only bosonic variables. one of the most
important properties of d-branes is that they are bps-saturated objects, that is, they
keep a half of the target space supersymmetries. so one hopes to extend this model to
supersymmetric branes. in general, the theory of a supersymmetric extended object must
have a local fermionic symmetry known as -symmetry [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 15, 31], which halves the number of the fermionic degrees of freedom
and equates it with that of the bosonic ones. the purpose of this letter is to prove
the -symmetry of the supersymmetric version of nurmagambetovs sl(2; z)-covariant
d3-brane action.

to start with, we review the sl(2; z)-covariant d3-brane action, proposed in [9]. its
dynamical variables are the embedding elds xm and the sl(2; z) doublet vector elds
ai,r (r = 1, 2), the eld strength of which is dened as fij,r = iaj,r  jai,r. the action
is composed of 3 parts
(1)

s = sdbi + sp st + sw z.

the rst part is a dirac-born-infeld term

sdbi = z d4  gf , f = s1 + hi,r(t m)rs h i

(2)

1also in [16, 17], the relation between the d3-brane action and the m5-brane one is investigated with

respect to the sl(2; z) duality.

hi,r = vj  hji,r ,h ij

hkl,r,

(3)

where hij,r is the improved eld strength hij,r = fij,r  cij,r (cij,r is the background
2-form) and vi is dened in terms of the worldvolume scalar a as

vi =

ia

q(a)2

.

notice that vi hi,r = 0 and (v)2 = 1. m is written in terms of the background scalars,
dilaton  and axion 

m =

the second part is a pasti-sorokin-tonin term

where c (4) is the background 4-form.

this action has the following local symmetries;

one usual gauge symmetry

the symmetry (9) was used to reduce the equation of motion for ai,r to the non-linear
,r = 0 [11, 12, 13, 9], which is necessary for keeping the number
duality equation gi
of the physical degrees of freedom of the d3-brane to be 8. on the other hand, the
symmetry (10) can be used to remove the auxiliary eld a. fixing this symmetry by
a condition ia = 0
i , one obtains an action which is no longer manifestly worldvolume
general coordinate covariant. solving one of the sl(2; z) doublet eld strength in terms
of the other, one recovers the conventional d3-brane action [16, 32].

now, we rewrite the action in a manifestly sl(2; z)-covariant manner. to this end
we introduce the complex sl(2; z) doublet background scalars ur [33, 34, 35], which
satisfy an sl(2; z)-invariant constraint

the physical background scalars,  and , belong to the coset space sl(2; r)/u(1)

in terms of these sl(2; z) invariants, the action is expressed as

fixing the u(1) symmetry by a condition im(u2) = 0, one obtains (2,6,7).

the supersymmetric action is identical to the bosonic one, but with the target space
replaced by the type-iib superspace with coordinates zm = (xm, ,  ), where  is a
10 dimensional weyl spinor and   is the complex conjugate of it. like other super-
symmetric branes, this action must have the -symmetry. in the rest, we will prove this
symmetry.

the  transformation is a kind of translation, which satises

izea = 0

ize =

ize  =  ,

(22)

where iz is the symbol for inner product: the inner product of a vector v n and a p-form
 = 1

p!dzm1...dzmpmp...m1 is dened as

iv  =

1

(p  1)!

dzm1...dzmp1v n n mp1...m1.

(23)

ea is the basis 1-form of the local lorentz frame, and is related to the coordinate 1-form
dzm

(24)
a is the super vielbein. the torsion 2-form is dened as the covariant derivative

ea = dzm em

a,

where em
of ea

t a = dea = dea + eb  a
b ,

(25)

where  b
its lie derivative

a

is the connection 1-form. the variation of a background form  is given by

(26)
using this formula, one obtains q, p , c (4), c(2) and ea, from which one can read
o the variation of the induced metric gij = ei

 = lz = (izd + diz).

(27)

one should take , rather than z, as the transformation parameter. the transformation
of ai,r should be specied in such a way that hij,r is -covariant, that is, contains no
derivatives of . so one takes a(1)

r = izc (2)

r

(28)

(29)

(30)

, and then obtains
b(izr(3))bc + ihij(izq).

cei
r(3) is dened by the same manner as (17,18)

hij = i hij(izp )  ej

where r(3)

r = dc (2)

r(3) = urr(3)

in what follows we set a = 0.

to proceed to the calculation of the  variation, we need the knowledge of the com-
ponents of the background elds. they are given by the supergravity constraint, which
is equivalent to the equation of motion of the supergravity. we use the constraint given
in [8] 2
(dimension 0 components)

a = (a),
t 
ra = 2(a),
rabc  = i(abc),

(dimension 1

2 components)

rabcd = 0,

p  = 0,
q = 0.

(32)

the components of dimension 1 and above do not appear in the  variation. those
relevant to the  variation which are not contained in (31,32) vanish. a is the 10
dimensional  matrix, and we use the real representation so that we do not distinguish
aa. we also dene
 from  in the r.h.s. of (31,32). in the following, we use i = ei
(4) = 0123 and so ((4))2 = g. we should note that the complex conjugation of the
product of fermionic quantities is dened without a reverse of the order.

using the above constraint, we proceed to the calculation of the  variation

respectively. clearly, when [ ] = [ ]p ( is an unconstrained spinor), l vanishes,
i.e., a half of fermions are not physical.
in this article, we proved the -symmetry of the sl(2; z)-covariant super d3-brane
action. like other supersymmetric brane cases, the background supergravity constraint
turned out to be a sucient condition for the -symmetry. though we have not shown
that this is also a necessary one, this model has passed a non-trivial test of the consistency
with the type-iib supergravity 3 .

topics concerning the supersymmetry have been major points of interest in the d-
brane physics. in a future work, the supersymmetry algebra [38, 39, 40, 41], bps satu-
rated worldvolume solitons [42, 43, 44, 45] etc. need to be also investigated.

to explain the origin of the sl(2; z) duality of the type-iib theory has been a main
motivation of f theory. in this respect it may be interesting to examine whether the
theory of sl(2; z)-covariant super d3-brane may have a 12 dimensional interpretation.
