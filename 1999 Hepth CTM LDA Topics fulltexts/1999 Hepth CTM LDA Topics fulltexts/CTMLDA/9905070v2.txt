abstract

a parametrization of the hamiltonian of the generalized witten model of the susy qm by a single
arbitrary function in d = 1 has been obtained for an arbitrary number of the supersymmetries n

n = 1 and 2 conformal susy qm is generalized for any n .

1 introduction

recently, the interest to the supersymmetric quantum mechanics [1], [2] has been renewed.

following the maldacenas conjecture [3] it has been argued [4], that the extended supercon-

formal quantum mechanics [5], [6], [7], [8] describes the dynamics of a d  0 brane in the

near horizon background of the extreme reisner-nordstrom black hole. in the framework

of the n = 1 susy qm the exactly solvable potentials of the common qm were classied

and found to be related to the integrability condition called shape invariance [9], [10]. there

is an exciting connection of the extended susy qm to the solution of the calogero type

many body potentials [11]. it has been noted [12], that the n  4 superconformal calogero

model has not been constructed yet. these motivations lead us to consider an old problem

of extending the susy qm to an arbitrary number of the supersymmetries n. unlike the

supersymmetric eld theories, where the number n is constrained by the spin content (

n = 4 for the sym, and n = 8 for the sugra both in d = 4), the extended susy qm

appears to have none. thus, we can consider n as a free parameter in the theory. for the

same reason the extended susy qm of n > 8 can not be the result of the dimensional

reduction of the corresponding eld theory. originally, the susy qm was rst considered

in the algebraic approach by witten [1], [2] before the supereld approach was developed in

[5], [13]. the main advantage of the latter is that it gives the susy qm a natural classical

foundation. on the other hand, the algebraic approach is more directly related to the quan-

tum mechanical aspects of the theory. although, it is possible to obtain the results of this

paper in both formalisms, we will consider here only the generalization of the witten model,

1

leaving the quasiclassical supereld treatment for elsewhere. the hamiltonian of the susy

qm has been obtained by pashnev [14] for n = 2 and 3. it was parametrized by a single

arbitrary function known as the superpotential. the case of an arbitrary n has not been

considered there or anywhere else. in a similar approach we have found a framework for

extending the susy qm to an arbitrary n. our main assumption is that the hamiltonian

of the susy qm must be the sum of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group

sn , which transform the supercharges. the representations can be parametrized by some

functions, which are all related through a compatibility condition to a single arbitrary pa-

rameter. the compatibility condition is the result of the requirement for the representations

to be totally symmetric and to satisfy superalgebra. it consists of the system of n  1 rst

order non-linear dierential equation for n functions, which can be solved in general for

any n. in the next sections we elaborate on the general formalism and as an illustration

consider n = 2 and 3 cases. then we treat the arbitrary n case. in the end as a special

example, we consider the extension of the conformal susy qm to an arbitrary n.

2 general formalism

the n susy qm is dened by the generators qi, q+

i , h of the superalgebra in the simplest

case without the central charges as follows

{qi, q+

j } = hij, {qi, qj} = {q+

i , q+

j } = 0, [qi, h] = [q+

i , h] = 0

(1)

qi = 

i (hx + w (x, 1, ..., i1, i+1, ..., n ))

2

h = h22

x + w 2 + hiw 

(2)

where +

i , 
i

, 3

i , i = 1...n are sets of the pauli matrices with [+

i , 

i ] = 3

i . in addition,

they satisfy the cliord algebra {+

i , 

j } = ij and represent the fermionic degrees of free-

dom, appearing naturally in the supereld approach after the quantization.1 we require

that the n supercharges are to be transformed by the irreducible representations of the sym-

metric group. hence, a superpotential w and its derivative w  must be totally symmetric

with respect to its fermionic variables. the form of the expression for n supercharges above

insures that the anticommutators of qi and q+

j vanish for all i 6= j. another requirement of

the superalgebra (1), that is the anticommutators of qi and q+

i give the same hamiltonian

for all i is sattised by imposing the equation

w 2(x, 2, 3, ..., n ) + h1w (x, 2, 3, ..., n )

(3)

= w 2(x, 1, 3, ..., n ) + h2w (x, 1, 3, ..., n )

on the potentials in (2). in fact, since the w is totally symmetric in all i, the equation

for the two potentials written above is sucient.we call this a compatibility condition. the

explicitly symmetric form of the w is written as

w (x, 2, 3, ..., n ) = w0 + (2 + 3 + ... + n )w1 + ... + 23...n wn 1

(4)

with this w the compatibility condition (3) turns into a system of n  1 rst order dier-

ential equations for n functions w0,w1,...,wn 1. thus, the solution and the hamiltonian

1 the cliord algebra cn can be realized in a standard way in terms of the direct product of the  and

unit matrices:

3

i  i = 11  ...  1i1  3  1i+1  ...  1n

3

can be parametrized by an arbitrary function.

3 n=2 and 3

it is now appropriate to illustrate the general formalism in simple cases, as well as to establish

the connection with the known results.

3.1 n=2

the superpotential w and the compatibility condition are

wn =2(x, 2) = w0 + 2w1

w 2(x, 2) + h1w (x, 2) = w 2(x, 1) + h2w (x, 1)

the equation on w0 and w1 is

hw 

0 = 2w0w1

the hamiltonian h and the superpotential are parametrized by w0 as

hn =2 = h22

x + w0 + 2

h

w

w0!2

w0!

wn =2(x, 2) = w0 + 2

w0

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

this reduces to n = 1 case by setting 2 to zero.

3.2 n=3.

the superpotential w can be parametrized recursively as

wn =3(x, 2, 3) = w0 + 2w1 + 3 (w1 + 2w2) .

(9)

4

comparing this with wn =2 (5), suggests that the compatibility condition can be written as

h (w0(x) + 2w1(x)) = 2 (w0(x) + 2w1(x)) (w1(x) + 2w2(x))

introducing new variables w1 = w0 + w1 and w2 = w0  w1 with two other relations h

this is the superpotential that was found by pashnev [14]. there is a dierent parametriza-

tion of the hamiltonian, which is more useful in dealing with the extension to an arbitrary

n. the equation (11) can be written as

(16)

and w1 taken as a parameter. this case can be also reduced to n = 2 by setting 3 equal

to zero.

4 arbitrary n

the symmetric superpotential w (x, 2, 3, ..., n ) is parametrized recursively by n functions

w0,w1, ..., wn 1

w = w0 + 2w1 + 3 (w1 + 2w2) + ... + n (w1 + 2w2 + 3 (w2 + 2w3)

+... + n 1(... + 3 (wn 2 + 2wn 1) )...)

(17)

the new variables w1, w2, ... ,wn 1 are introduced similarly to n = 3 case. they are all the

distinct combinations of the functions w0,w1, ..., wn 2 in the rst half of the superpotential

w as i run over the values 1 in turn. we have other n  1 relations between w1,w2, ...,

wn 1 from the compatibility condition in the way similar to (10). in the new variables wi

the compatibility condition is written as the system of n  2 equations

(19)

for any n it is always possible to invert a system of linear equations in order to express wi

in terms of wi, so that the hamiltonian is parametrized by a single function, say w1.

5 superconformal qm and calogero type potentials

the conformal quantum mechanics in d = 1 is dened [15] by the generators of the conformal

group h, k, and d. the hamiltonian of the theory

h =

1

2 (cid:18)p2 +

g

x2(cid:19)

(20)

was found to have a non-normalizable ground state. when the isomorphism between the

conformal group and the group so(2, 1) was used to construct new generators as the linear

combinations of the old, it was suggested to use the generator of the compact rotation of

so(2, 1) as a new hamiltonian ( with h = 1 )

hnew =

which has a normalizable ground state and the spectrum similar to that of a compact operator

r = r0 + n, n = 0, 1, ...

(22)

r0 =

(1 +sg +

)

it has been noted, that this is equivalent to elimination of a coordinate singularity [16] or

to a non-linear change of the space-time variables [5].

in the later developments [5], [6]

7

the supersymmetric conformal qm for n = 1 and 2 was constructed. after regularization

similar to that in (21) the spectrum of the n = 1 hamiltonian

hn =1 =

can be obtained from the that of the common conformal qm (22) by the substitution g

notice, that the x-dependence is factorized in the conformal potential, leaving the nu-

merator as a polynomial of the fermionic variable . it has been conjectured [14], that the

factorization of the bosonic variables in the case of the conformal potential persists for an

arbitrary n. we are going to show next that this is indeed the case. moreover, we have

obtained a whole class of the potentials with such property. the number of the potentials in

each class grows with n. in addition to the requirement for the hamiltonian to be a totally

symmetric form of its fermionic variables we also demand the factorization of its bosonic

variables. that leads us to the following ansatz for the superpotential w

w (x, 2, 3, ..., n ) = w0p (2, 3, ..., n )

p (2, 3, ..., n ) = 1 + a1(2 + ... + n ) + ... + an 123...n

(25)

(26)

where all the wi are proportional to w0 with coecients ai. the compatibility condition

(3) is now

w 2

0 p (2, 3, ..., n )2 + 1w 

0p (2, 3, ..., n )

(27)

= w 2

0 p (1, 3, ..., n )2 + 2w 

0p (1, 3, ..., n )

in the case of the potential w0 = 

xx0

it reduces to a system of n  1 second order algebraic

equations for n variables - the coecients ai and parameter . as an example we now

consider the n = 4 case. the coecients ai are the solution of the system

2a1 + 2a2a3 + 4a1a2 = 

2a2

2 + 2a2

1 + 2a2 + 2a1a3 = 

6a1a2 + 2a3 =

which can be turned into an equation of the 6th order and gives the roots explicitly.similarly,

n = 3 case gives three and n = 5 fteen roots. the solutions could be relevant to the

classication of the irreducible representations of sn . it may turn out, that there exists the

correspondence between the n-particle conformal susy qm and su(n) ym in d = 2 ,

which was discussed in [17]. symmetry and classication of the solutions for arbitrary n

requires an additional analysis. however, there is one solution that can be found for any

n. when x0 is zero, it corresponds to the known n = 1 and 2 conformal susy qm of [6],

[5] and its generalization for arbitrary n. in order to see that we rewrite the potential as a

complete square

w 2 + 1w  =

(p (2, 3, ..., n )  1

the compatibility condition in this case can be written as

for any n it has a solution, which corresponds to the + sign in the equation above

ai = 0

i 6= 1

(30)

thus, the complete hamiltonian of the conformal susy qm for any n has identical structure

with that of n = 1 (23 ), except for the constant

r = r0 + n

n = 0, 1, ...

(32)

6 discussion

we have shown, that the extended susy qm can be constructed from the assumption, that

the hamiltonian is the sum of the irreducible representation of the symmetric group sn .

in order to satisfy all the commutation and anticommutation relations in the simplest case

(without central charges) of the extended superalgebra, the parametric functions of the rep-

resentations must obey the compatibility condition. it has been shown that these condition

can be solved in the iteration procedure for an arbitrary number of the supersymmetries n.

10

the solution allows to parametrize the hamiltonian by a single arbitrary function. using the

factorization property of the conformal potential, the conformal susy qm has been derived

for any n as a natural generalization of the known n = 1 and n = 2 cases. however, it

has been also found that there is the whole class of possible generalizations of the theory for

every n corresponding to various irreducible representations of the group sn.

we would like to point out that the formalism can be broadened to include a number

of other aspects of the susy qm. among a few, which seem to us most interesting, we

are going to discuss in the following. the incorporation of the many dimensions [18] in

this formalism will require the more general extended superalgebra with the central charges.

the equivalence of the many dimensional and many particle theories in qm, as well as the

special role of the superconformal potential would make possible to construct the susy qm

with the calogero type potentials for any n . such theory in d = 1 and for n = 4 has been

argued in [12] to be a microscopic description of a black hole. the question of the supereld

generalization of the extended susy qm has been left open. there are exciting areas of the

susy qm such as the swkb and shape invariant potentials, which can be treated using

this formalism for arbitrary n. we can anticipate the new results in the classication of the

exactly solvable potentials. in the context of the n arbitrary we can consider a potential of

the susy qm as the expansion in the powers of the plank constant h and introduce a new

limit of the number of the supersymmetries n approaching innity.
