abstract

in this article we show that boundary conditions can be treated as lagrangian and

hamiltonian constraints. using the dirac method, we nd that boundary conditions

are equivalent to an innite chain of second class constraints which is a new feature in

the context of constrained systems. constructing the dirac brackets and the reduced

phase space structure for dierent boundary conditions, we show why mode expanding

and then quantizing a eld theory with boundary conditions is the proper way. we

also show that in a quantized eld theory subjected to the mixed boundary conditions,

the eld components are noncommutative.

1 introduction

it is well-known that to formulate a general classical eld theory dened in a box, besides

the equations of motion one should know the behaviour of the elds on the boundaries,

boundary conditions. boundary conditions are usually relations between the elds and their

various derivatives, including the time derivative, on the boundaries, expected to be held at

all the times. in hamiltonian language the boundary conditions are in general functions of

the elds and their conjugate momenta; hence the eld theories subjected to the boundary

conditions might be understood by the prescription for handling the constrained systems

proposed by dirac [1].

in the usual eld theory arguments, since boundary conditions are usually linear com-

binations of elds and their momenta, one can easily impose them on the solutions of the

equations of motion, and nd the nal result. but, imposing the boundary conditions in

some special cases may lead to inconsistencies with the canonical commutation relations

[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

in this article, considering the boundary conditions as constraints, we apply the diracs

procedure to this constrained system. although this idea have been used in [5, 6], the

problem has new and special features in the context of constrained systems on which, we

mostly concentrate.

in the second section, we review the lagrangian and hamiltonian constrained systems.

in section 3, to visualize the seat of boundary conditions we take a toy model and by

discretizing the model show that boundary conditions are in fact the equations of motion

for the points at the boundaries so that, when we go to the continuum limit, i.e.

, the

original theory, the acceleration term disappears. in other words boundary conditions are

lagrangian constraints which are not consequences of a singular lagrangian. in section 4,

going to hamiltonian picture we study the constraint structure resulting from the boundary

conditions, and apply it explicitly to some eld theories. implying constraint consistency

we show that although the lagrange multiplier is determined, the constraint chain is not

terminated, this is a new feature in the constrained systems analysis. exhausting all the

consistency checks we end up with an innite constraint chain which all of them are of second

class, which is another new feature of this constraint structure. moreover, we construct the

fundamental dirac brackets, the dirac brackets of elds and their conjugate momenta. in

section 5, by a canonical transformation we go to the fourier modes in terms of which, the

constraint chain obtained in the previous section can be easily solved. in this way we prove

that, using the proper mode expansions is equivalent to working in the reduced phase space.

2

in section 6, we apply the machinery developed in the previous sections to the case of mixed

boundary conditions, i.e. , we nd the constraints chain, the dirac bracket and the reduced

phase space. the new and interesting result of this case is that, the dirac bracket of two

eld components is obtained to be non-zero and hence, in the quantum theory these eld

components are noncommuting. the last section is devoted to the concluding remarks.

2 review of dirac procedure

given the lagrangian l(q, q) (or l(, ) in a eld theory), the lagrangian equations of

motion are:

li = wij qj + i = 0,

(2.1)

l

where li are eulerian derivatives, wij(q, q)  2l
 qi qj is called the hessian matrix, and i 
qi  qj( 2l
 qiqj ). if |wij| = 0, the lagrangian is called singular and in this case the number
of equations containing accelerations are less than the number of degrees of freedom. hence
a number of lagrangian constraints, a(q, q) = 0, emerges (to obtain these constraints we
should simply multiply both sides of (2.1) by the null eigenvector a
i i,
[8].). then we should add the time derivatives of constraints, a(q, q), to the set of equations
of motion to get new relations containing the accelerations. as a result two cases may happen

i of w , so a(q, q) = a

1) the rank of equations with respect to acceleration is equal to the number of degrees of

freedom.

2) new constraints, acceleration free relations, emerging.

in the rst case the equations of motion can be solved completely, however, the solutions

should obey the acceleration free equations, the constraints. in the second, the derivatives

of new constraints and derivatives of previous constraints should be added to the equations

of motion, and the same scenario should be repeated.

at the end, there may remain a number of undetermined accelerations; it is shown that

they correspond to the gauge degrees of freedom and are related to the rst class hamiltonian

constraints. moreover roughly speaking, there may exist some degrees of freedom which have

no dynamics and are completely determined via the constraints. these are related to the

the second class hamiltonian constraints [9].

let us study the hamiltonian formulation. singularity of the hessian matrix, pi

 qj , implies
the legendre transformation, (q, q)  (q, p), to have a zero jacobian and hence, the set of

3

momenta, pi;

pi =

l
 qi

,

(2.2)

are not independent functions of q and q. so a number of hamiltonian primary constraints

turns up

(0)

a (q, p) = 0.

it can be shown that [1] dynamics of any function in phase space is obtained by

g  {g, ht}p.b.,

where weak equality, , is the equality on the constraint surface, and

ht = h + aa,

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

is the total hamiltonian, a being the lagrange multipliers.

like the lagrangian case the consistency conditions of the primary constraints should be

investigated, i.e. the constraints should be valid under the time evolution:

(0)
a  {(0)

a , ht}p.b.  {(0)

a , h} + b{(0)

a , (0)

b }  0.

(2.6)

if the above relation dose not hold identically, then two possibilities remains i) {(0)
vanish weakly. in this case new hamiltonian constraints

a , (0)

b }s

turns up.

(1) = {(0)

a , h},

(2.7)

a , (0)

ii) {(0)
in general, depending on the rank of the matrix {(0)

b } do not vanish, yielding equations for determining a.

b }, we may have a mixture of
two possibilities. that is, some of the lagrange multipliers are determined and a number of

a , (0)

new constraints emerge. here we do not bother the reader with the details. a complete and

detailed discussion can be found in [9].

now the consistency conditions of (1)
a

should be veried which may result into some
new constraints (2)
a . the procedure goes on, and nally we end up with some constraint
chains. roughly speaking, each chain terminates if a lagrange multiplier is determined or,

if we get an identically satised relation. the latter case happens when the last constraint

has weakly vanishing poisson bracket with the primary constraints and the hamiltonian.

we denote the set of constraints (1), (2), .... as secondary constraints . these are really
consequences of primary constraints while the primary constraints, by themselves have their

4

origin in the singularity of the lagrangian (singularity of the hessian matrix). in a pure

hamiltonian point of view, however, the origin of primary constraints is not of essential im-

portance. in any way given some primary constraints, we should build the total hamiltonian,

(2.5), and check their consistency.

there is another important classication of constraints: if the poisson bracket of some

constraint with all the constraints in the chain vanishes, it is called rst class. and if the
matrix of mutual poisson brackets of a subset of constraints, c m n ,

c m n = {m , n},

(2.8)

has the maximally rank, it is invertible, we deal with second class constraints. it is shown that

a constraint chain terminating with an identity, is of rst class and ending with determining

lagrange multipliers are of second class [9]. to nd the dynamics of a system with second

class constraints, one may use the dirac bracket,

{a, b}d.b. = {a, b}p.b.  {a, m}p.b. (c1)m n{n , b}p.b..

(2.9)

the important property of the dirac bracket is that for an arbitrary function a and for all

second class constraints m ,

{m , a}d.b. = 0.

(2.10)

it can be shown that, using the dirac brackets instead of poisson bracket, is equivalent to

priory putting the second class constraints strongly equal to zero.

for second class constraints we can always nd a canonical transformation such that

the constraints, m , lie on the rst 2n coordinates (q1, ..., qn; p1, ..., pn) of the phase space
and the remaining degrees of freedom, (q1, ..., qnn; p1, ..., pnn) are unconstrained. the
dirac bracket in the original phase space is equal to the poisson bracket in the space
(q1, ..., qnn; p1, ..., pnn), the reduced phase space [1, 10, 11]. although nding the above
canonical transformation is not an easy task, for the case we study in this paper, bound-

ary conditions as constraints, we show that using the suitable mode expansions, is in fact

equivalent to going to reduced phase space.

3 boundary conditions as constraints

boundary conditions are acceleration free equations which in general are not related to a

singular lagrangian. to visualize this point, let us take a simple (1+1) eld theory as a toy

5

model

s =

2 z l

dxz t2

t1

dt [(t)2  (x)2].

(3.1)

variation of the action with respect to  gives

dxz t2
where l() = 2
x, is the eulerian derivative. for an arbitrary , variation of the
action vanishes if the three terms in the above equation vanish independently. the rst

s = z l

t1,

dt(x)|l

0 + z l

(3.2)

t1

t1

0

term in (3.2) leads to equations of motion and the last term to the initial conditions.

the second term which is called the surface term, results in the boundary conditions. for
this term to vanish, there are two choices |boundary = 0, dirichlet boundary conditions,
or x|boundary = 0, neumann boundary conditions. the boundary conditions unlike the
equations of motion, are acceleration-free equations and should be held at all the times. in

other words, they can be treated as lagrangian constraints. to clarify this point we repeat

the above argument in the discrete version:

s =

(i  i+1)2,

and  = l

n so that   0 (n  ) reproduces the continuum theory.

demanding the variation of (3.3) to vanish, leads to 2

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

taking the continuum limit, assuming that acceleration of the end point are nite, the

equations for 0, n give

lim

1


(1  0) = 0 and

lim

1


(n  n1) = 0.

(3.8)

hence in the continuum limit equations of motion for the end points give acceleration free

equations, the lagrangian constraints, where as (3.6) leads to l() = 0, which actually

contains the acceleration term.

2 it is worth noting that we still have the option 0 or n = 0 which in the continuum limit translate

into the dirichlet boundary conditions .

6

a new feature appearing here is that, unlike the usual lagrangian constraints, boundary

conditions are the constraints which are not consequences of the singularity of lagrangian,

but a result of taking the continuum limit.

4 the hamiltonian setup

in this section, by going to hamiltonian formulation, we apply the dirac procedure to a eld

theory with given boundary conditions. again, we take our simple toy model and treat the

boundary conditions as hamiltonian primary constraints:

(0) = x|x=0.

(4.1)

here we explicitly work out neumann boundary condition at one end , the neumann bound-

ary condition at the other end and the dirichlet cases can be worked out similarly. the total

hamiltonian is built by adding the constraint to the hamiltonian by arbitrary lagrange

multiplier

with

h =

ht = h + (0),

2 z l

0

dx 2 + (x)2,

 = t.

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

we should remind that as discussed in sec. 2, the appearance of the constraints (4.1) is not a

consequence of the denition of the momenta for an ordinary singular lagrangian and hence,

the transformation (4.4) between the velocities and momenta is well-dened and invertible

throughout all the points, even at the boundaries.

now we should check the consistency condition

(0) = {(0), ht}p.b. = x|0  (1),

(4.5)

which leads to the secondary constraint, (1).
although the conditions are imposed at the boundaries, the elds can safely be extended

it should be noted that to obtain (4.5),

into neighbourhood of the boundaries and we can use (0) = r (x)xdx.

we should go further:

(1) = {(1), ht} = {(1), h} + {(1), (0)} = 0.

(4.6)

7

the second term on the right hand side,

{(1), (0)} = r (x)(x){x, x}dxdx
= r (x)(x)xx(x  x)dxdx,

(4.7)

x(x  x)|x=x=0. this term compared
is not well-dened, and formally can be written as 2
to the rst term is innitely large. the only way to impose the consistency condition on the

constraints is

and

 = 0,

{(1), h} = 0.

(4.8)

(4.9)

there is a new feature appearing which is not any of the cases i) and ii) discussed in section

2. the consistency condition, (4.6), reduces to two equations, (4.8) and (4.9), and although

the lagrange multiplier is determined the constraint chain is not terminated.

the above discussion can be better understood if the calculation is regularized by con-

sidering the discrete case. using the the discrete version of equation (4.6),  is turned out to
be of the order of , going to the continuum limit is vanishes, and the other term, {(1), h},
should vanish separately.

dening {(1), h} as (2), the other secondary constraint, we nd

(2) = 3

x|0.

we should go on:

(3)  (2) = {(2), ht} = {(2), h} = 3

x|0.

(4.10)

(4.11)

this process should be continued and nally we are left with an innite number of constraints:

(n) =




(n+1)
x

|0 n = 0, 2, 4, ...
(n)
x |0 n = 1, 3, 5, ...

(4.12)

exhausted the constraint consistency conditions, we show that the poisson bracket of the

constraints,

cmn  {(m), (n)},

(4.13)

8

is non-singular and hence, the set of constraints (4.12) are all of second class. to show this

rst we calculate

cmn =

m, n = 0, 2, 4, ...

m, n = 1, 3, 5, ...

(4.14)

r (x)(x)m+1

x

x(x  x)dxdx m = 0, 2, 4, ...., n = 1, 3, 5, ...
n

to nd detc, the non-zero elements should be regularized. this regularization can be done

by two methods, discretization or using a limit of a regular function, e.g.

the gaussian

function, to represent (x). here we choose the second, but one can easily show that the

other method gives the same results. inserting

and b is an innite dimensional matrix with

2(m+n)1

m, n = 1, 2, ....

(4.18)

it is straightforward to show that the matrix b has non-zero determinant, i.e. the matrix c

is invertible, and hence all the constraints in the chain are second class. one way to consider

all of them is using the dirac bracket. to nd dirac bracket of any two arbitrary functions
in the phase space, it is enough to calculate dirac brackets of (, ) , (, ) and (, ) 3

mn{(n), (x)} = 0.
mn{(n), (x)} = 0.

without using the explicit form of c1 one can show

with an arbitrary function f , using (2.10) we should have

{x(x)|0, f (, )}d.b. = z (x)x{(x), f}d.b. = 0.

denoting

f

((x))  g(x), we can write

z (x)x{(x), (x)}d.b.g(x) = 0.

inserting (4.21) and (4.22) into (4.24) reduces to

z (x(x) + (x)x(x))g(x) = 0.

remembering (4.15), we nd

hence

(4.25)

(4.26)

(4.27)

appearance of regularization parameter, , in the dirac bracket sounds bad, but since the

second term has two delta functions, to be of the same order of the rst term, in fact an 

factor is necessary. we will clarify and discuss this point in the next section.

the dirichlet boundary condition can be worked out similarly. in this case the constraint

chain is obtained to be

(n) =




(n)
x |0 n = 0, 2, 4, ...
|0 n = 1, 3, 5, ...

(n1)

(4.28)

performing the calculations, one can show that the dirac brackets are like the neumann
case, except for the  factor, which is +.

5 mode expansion and reduced phase space

in the previous section we showed that a eld theory subjected to the neumann or dirichlet

boundary conditions is a system constrained to an innite chain of second class constraints.

as mentioned in sec. 2, for a system with second class constraints, there is a subspace of

phase space which is spanned by a set of unconstrained canonical variables, the reduced

phase space. the important property of these variables is that, poisson bracket in terms of

them is equivalent to the dirac bracket dened on the whole constrained phase space.

in this section we will explicitly nd the reduced phase space and show that it is in fact

equivalent to phase space determined by the fourier modes.

let us consider the fourier transformed variables

(x) = 12 r (k)eikxdk
(x) = 12 r (k)eikxdk

,

,

(k) = 12 r (x)eikxdx
(k) = 12 r (x)eikxdx.

(5.1)

one can easily show that the above transformation is canonical:

{(k), (k)} = 0 ,

{(k), (k)} = 0 ,

{(k), (k)} = (k  k).

(5.2)

the neumann (dirichlet) constraint chain, (4.12) and (4.28), in terms of the new variables

are easily obtained: all the odd (even) moments of (k) and (k) are zero. the most general

solution to these conditions is that (k) and (k) are even (odd) functions of k. then (5.1)
gives 4

(5.3)

(x) =

1

 z (k) cos kxdk

,

(x) =

1

 z (k) cos kxdk.

the main advantage of the fourier modes, (k) and (k), is that although they are limited

to even (odd) functions, are still canonical variables; in contrast with the original elds (x)

and (x) which lose their usual canonical structure due to constraints.

to compare the dirac bracket results with those of reduced phase space, we work out

poisson brackets of (x) and (x). using (5.2) and (5.3) we have

{(x), (x)} = 0,
{(x), (x)} = 0,
 r cos kx cos kxdk  n (x, x),

{(x), (x)} = 1

(5.4)

4for dirichlet case cosine should be replaced be sine.

11

for neumann boundary conditions. for dirichlet case only {, } diers from above:

{(x), (x)} =
performing the integrations we have

1

 z sin kx sin kxdk  d(x, x).

n (x, x) = (x  x) + (x + x),
d(x, x) = (x  x)  (x + x).

(5.5)

(5.6)

if we consider only the positive xs, x  0, n and d for x, x 6= 0 are exactly (x x). for
x, x = 0, we regularize delta functions by




(x  x) + (x + x) = 2 ,
(x  x)  (x + x) = 0.

at x = x = 0

(5.7)

hence n and d for x  0 is in exact agreement with the dirac bracket results obtained
in previous section. the above argument claries, why using the usual mode expansions

to quantize a system with neumann or dirichlet boundary condition, i.e.

, imposing the

boundary conditions and then quantizing, works.

6 mixed boundary conditions, another example

in this section we handle a more general family of boundary conditions, mixed boundary

conditions, which are combinations of neumann and dirichlet cases. it has been shown that

these boundary conditions lead to unusual results in the context of string theory [2, 3, 4, 5,

6, 7].

as a toy model for a eld theory resulting in the mixed boundary conditions consider

s =

1

2 z l

0

dxz t2

t1

dt[(ti)2  (xi)2 + fijtixj],

(6.1)

where i, j = 1, 2 and fij is a constant antisymmetric background. varying s with respect
to i, gives:

t i  2
2

xi = 0,

xi + fijtj = 0 at x = 0, l.

12

(6.2)

(6.3)

equations (6.3), as discussed in section 3, give the lagrangian constraints. in the discretized

version, (6.3) are the equations of motion for the end points and in the continuum limit,

the acceleration term disappears. it is worth noting that (6.3) reproduce the neumann and
dirichlet boundary conditions for f = 0 and  respectively.

now to apply the dirac method, we go to hamiltonian formulation:

h =

and the primary constraints,

with

i = ti + fijxj,
(i  fijxj)2 + (xi)2 dx,

1

2 z l

(0)
i = i(x)|x=0,

i(x)  mijxj + fijj = 0 , mij = (1  f 2)ij.

(6.4)

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

note that in this case the lagrangian constraints, (6.3), depends on velocities, and as men-

tioned before, the transformation (6.4), is non-singular and the lagrangian constraints can

be translated into hamiltonian constraints, (6.7), without any diculty. the consistency of

the primary constraints should be veried:

(0)
i = {(0)

i

, ht} = {(0)

i

, h} + j{(0)

i

, (0)

j } = 0.

(6.8)

the rst term is easy to work out:

similar to the arguments of sec. 4, {(0)
and the only way for (6.8) to be satised is

i

i

i = {(0)
(1)
, (0)

, h} = xi|x=0.
j } is innitely large compared to the rst term,

(6.9)

i = 0

and (1)

i = 0.

(6.10)

again, although the lagrange multiplier, i, is determined, there are secondary constraints,
(1)

i = 0. moreover we have the advantage that i disappears in the remaining steps.

direct calculations on the consistency conditions for the constraints leads to the chain

(6.14)

and b given by (4.18). in section 4, we discussed that b is invertible. since det f 6= 0, c
is invertible too, hence all the constraints in the chain (6.11) are second class.

one can show that the fundamental dirac brackets are as following

the important result of the mixed case is (6.15); the dirac bracket of two eld com-

ponents are non-zero. this means that in the quantized theory these eld components are

noncommuting. in the string theory, where the elds describe the space coordinates, (6.15)

tells us that, the space probed by open strings with mixed boundary conditions is a non-

commutative space [2, 3, 4].

using the canonical (or fourier) transformations, (5.1) and (5.2), we can explicitly build

up the reduced phase space for the mixed case. let i(k) represent the fourier modes of
i(x) dened in (6.7),

i(x) =

1

2 z i(k)eikxdk

,

i(k) =

1

2 z i(x)eikxdx,

(6.18)

using (5.2), poisson brackets of i(k) and i(k) can be worked out. imposing the constraints
(6.11), we nd that i(k) and j(k), are odd and even functions of k respectively:

i(x) =

1

 z i(k) sin kxdk

,

i(x) =

1

 z i(k) cos kxdk.

(6.19)

remembering (6.7), we can derive the eld components:

i(x) =

m1

ij z dk

k

(j(k) cos kx + fjkk(k) sin kx),

(6.20)

which explicitly satises the mixed boundary conditions.

derived the mode expansions of the elds and their conjugate momenta, we nds their

poisson brackets:

{i(x), j(x)} = 1

 r dk

k

dk

k [(m1f )ik{k(k), l(k)}m1
+(m1f )jk{k(k), l(k)}m1

lj cos kx sin kx+

il cos kx sin kx]

= 1

k (m1f )ij(cos kx sin kx + cos kx sin kx)

 r dk
= (m1f )ij r x(n (y, x)  d(y, x))dy

= 2(m1f )ij r x (y + x)dy.

since for x, x  0

z x

(y + x)dy =

(6.21) is non-zero only for x, x = 0:

1

0




x = x = 0

otherwise,

{i(0), j(0)} = 2(m1f )ij.

(6.21)

(6.22)

(6.23)

comparing (6.21) and (6.15), we nd that they are exactly the same. in other words, (6.19)

and (6.20) are functions dening the reduced phase space.

in the context of string theory, (6.21) implies that the end points of open strings subjected

to mixed boundary conditions are living in a noncommutative space. the mixed open strings

appear when we are studying d-branes in a nsns two-form background. in this case, (6.21)

tells us that the world-volume of such branes are noncommutative planes.

we can also calculate {i(x), j(x)} and {i(x), j(x)}. the results are in exact agree-

ment with (6.16) and (6.17).

7 concluding remarks

in this paper, we studied the old and well-known problem of eld theories with boundary

conditions from a new point of view. we discussed that in the lagrangian formulation

boundary conditions are lagrangian constraints which are not a consequence of a singular

lagrangian. for further study we built the hamiltonian formulation, and considered bound-

ary conditions as primary constraints. asking for the constraints consistency conditions we

found two new features in the context of constrained systems

1) although the lagrange multiplier in the total hamiltonian is determined, the con-

straints chain is continued.

2) boundary conditions are equivalent to an innite chain of second class constraints.

constructing the dirac brackets of the elds and their conjugate momenta for these

second class constraints, we showed that the method based on mode expansion, is equivalent

to working in the reduced phase space.

the relation between hamiltonian method we built here and the usual method of im-

posing boundary conditions in the equations of motion, can simply be understood. in the

former, to ensure that boundary conditions are satised, we make the taylor expansion of

boundary conditions as a function of time, and put all the coecient equal to zero. these

coecients are exactly our constraint chain. but, in the latter, the fourier mode expansion

is used and boundary conditions are guaranteed by choosing all the fourier components to

satisfy boundary conditions.

in the last section of the paper, we handled the mixed boundary conditions which seems

to be an exciting problem in the context of string theory [7]. having noncommuting eld

components, is the interesting feature appearing in this case. besides the string theory,

mixed boundary conditions can be encountered in the context of electrodynamics having an

extra -term:

s =

1

4 z (f 2

 + ff).

in the above action  plays a role similar f in our toy model. varying the action gives

a surface term, vanishing of which leads the mixed boundary conditions. quantizing this

theory is an interesting problem we postpone it to future works.
