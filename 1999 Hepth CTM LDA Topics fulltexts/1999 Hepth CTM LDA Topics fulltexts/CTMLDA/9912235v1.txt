abstract

this paper is concerned with a structural analysis of euclidean eld
theories on the euclidean sphere. in the rst section we give proposal
for axioms for a euclidean eld theory on a sphere in terms of c*-
algebras.

then, in the second section, we investigate the short-distance be-
havior of euclidean eld theory models on the sphere by making use
of the concept of scaling algebras, which has rst been introduced by
d. buchholz, and r. verch and which has also be applied to euclidean
eld theory models on at euclidean space in a previous paper. we
establish the expected statement that that scaling limit theories of eu-
clidean eld theories on a sphere are euclidean eld theories on at
euclidean space.

keeping in mind that the minkowskian analogue of the euclidean
sphere is the de sitter space, we develop a osterwalder-schrader type
construction scheme which assigns to a given euclidean eld theory on
the sphere a quantum eld theory on de sitter space. we show that the
constructed quantum eld theoretical data fullls the so called geodesic
kms condition in the sense of h. j. borchers and d. buchholz, i.e. for
any geodesic observer the system looks like a system within a thermal
equilibrium state.

1 introduction

one basic motivation for studying structural aspects of euclidean eld
theory models on a sphere is that the nite volume of the sphere can
be regarded as a natural infra-red regularizator.
in fact, there are
indications that non-trivial euclidean eld theory models with an infra-
red cuto can be constructed. this is based on the work of j. magnen,
v. rivasseau, and r. seneor [17] where it is claimed that the yang-
mills4 model exists within a nite euclidean volume.

euclidean eld theory on the sphere.
in order to give an
overview of the ideas and strategies we use, a brief description of the
setup, we are going to use, is given here. euclidean eld theory on
a sphere can be formulated in a analogous manner as euclidean eld
theory on rd [19]. for a precise formulation of the axioms, we refer
the reader to section 2. the mathematical ingredients which model
the concepts of euclidean eld theory consist of two main objects, a
c*-algebra and a particular class of states on it.

the c*-algebra b, the rst ingredient, has the following structure:
to each region v , for our purpose v is a subset of the d-dimensional
euclidean sphere, a c*-subalgebra b(v )  b is assigned. we require
that this assignment is isotonous and local in the sense that, v1  v2
implies b(v1)  b(v2) and operators which are localized in disjoint
regions commute, i.e. v1  v2 =  implies [b(v1), b(v2)] = {0}. in
addition to that, the assignment v 7 b(v ) has a symmetry. the
rotation group o(d + 1) acts covariantly on the algebra b by automor-
phisms h, here h is a rotation, such that the algebra b(v ) is mapped
via h onto the algebra of the corresponding rotated region b(hv ).

the states, which are of interest for our considerations, are rota-
tion invariant reexion positive regular states . rotation invariance
just means that  is invariant under the automorphisms h. the prop-
erties reexion positivity and regularity are precisely formulated in
section 2. roughly speaking, both reexion positivity and regularity
impliy cretain analytic properties within variables upon which partic-
ular correlation functions depend. this fact is an essential ingredient
for constructing a quantum eld theory from euclidean data.

scaling algebras and renormalization group. a general ap-
proach for the analysis of the high energy properties of a given quantum
eld theory model has been developed by d. buchholz and r. verch
[6, 8, 5, 4, 3, 2]. such a short distance analysis can analogously be
carried out for euclidean eld theory models [21].

we show in section 3 that the scaling limit theories of euclidean
eld theories within a nite volume, here on a sphere, are essentially
independent of the volume cuto, the radius of the sphere. as a result

2

euclidean eld theories on at euclidean space rd are the result of the
scaling limit procedure. this is what one expects, and we mention at
this point that the analogous situation has already been studied for the
analogous situation in minkowski space [7]. more precisely, the scaling
limits of a quantum eld theory in de sitter spacetime are quantum
eld theories in at minkowski space.

for a point e  rsd, the stabilizer subgroup of e in o(d + 1) is
isomorphic to o(d).
if the scaling limit procedure is performed at
e, the invariance under the stabilizer subgroup should remain as a
o(d) invariance within the scaling limit. the translation invariance
should then enter from the fact that the state under consideration  is
invariant under the full group o(d + 1). the scaling limit procedure
which we going to use can also be seen as blowing up the radius of the
sphere and we always choose r = 1 for the unscaled theory.

quantum eld theory on de sitter spacetime. keeping in
mind that the minkowskian analogue of the euclidean d-sphere sd 
rd+1 is the de sitter space, we show in section 4, by exploring the
analytic structure of de sitter space, that from a given euclidean eld
(b, , ) on the sphere sd a quantum eld theory (a, , ) on de sitter
space can be constructed. the constructed state  satises the geodesic
kms condition which means that for any geodesic observer the state 
looks like an equilibrium state. these type of states have been analyzed
by h. j. borchers and d. buchholz [1]. a constructive example which
ts perfectly within our axiomatic framework has been given by r.
figari, r. hoegh-krohn, and c. r. nappi [10].

2 formulation of the axioms

the starting point in the framework of algebraic euclidean eld theory
is an isotonous net

v 7 b(v )  b

of c*-subalgebras of b, indexed by convex sets v  sd. this net
covers the kinematical aspects of a particular model. we require the
following properties for the net:

o(d+ 1)-covariance: there exists a group homomorphism  from
the orthogonal group o(d + 1) into the automorphism group of b such
that for each convex ste v  sd one has

hb(v ) = b(hv )

for each h  o(d + 1).

3

locality:

if v1  v2 = , then [b(v1), b(v2)] = {0}.

we consider a particular class of states on b which contain the
dynamical information of the particular model. in order to formulate
the analogue property of reexion positivity in the euclidean approach
in at space, we consider for each point e  sd on the sphere the half
space

hd+1

e

:= r+e + e  rd+1

in the ambient space and we build the half sphere

hsd
e

:= hd+1

e  sd .

e. the reexion e  o(d + 1) at the hyperplane p d
e and it leaves the hypersphere sd1

e onto hsd

e maps hsd
e stable.

we denote by b(e) the c*-algebra generated by operators which are
localized in hsd
e =
hd+1
e =
hsd

e hd+1
e  hsd
we are now prepared to formulate sucient properties, shared by
those states on b, which enable us to construct quantum eld theory
model from the euclidean data.

rotation invariance: a state  on b is called euclidean invariant
if for each h  o(d + 1) the identity   h =  holds true.

reexion positivity: a state  on b is called reexion positive
if exists a point e  sd on the sphere such that the sesquilinear form

b(e)  b(e)  b0  b1 7 h, je(b0)b1i

is positive semi denite. here, je is the anti-linear involution which is
given by je(b) = e(b).

regularity: a state  on b is called regular if for each b0, b1, b2  b
the map

h 7 < , b0h(b1)b2 >

is continuous.

a triple (b, , ) consisting of a euclidean net of c*-algebras (b, )
and a euclidean invariant reexion positive regular state  is called a
euclidean eld on the sphere sd.

3 short-distance analysis for efth on sd

for e  sd we consider the coordinate chart

e : hsd

e  x 7 x  (ex)e  rd

where p d
h  o(d + 1) we get

e is identied with rd in a canonical manner. for an element

h  e = he  h .

in particular, e is mapped to 0 via e. for e1  sd, e1e = 0, the
e1  hsd
hypersphere sd1
e is mapped
into the hyperplane p d1
e is mapped into the
halfspace hd1

contains e. as a consequence sd1

e(e1)  rd and hsd1

e1  hsd

e1

e(e1)  rd.

from a given euclidean eld (b, , ) on the sphere sd and a point
e  sd, we obtain a net u 7 be(u ) of c*-algebras in a natural
manner by setting

be(u )

:= b(1

e (u ))

for each bounded convex set u  rd, where we use the convention
b() := c1. let e be the restriction of  to the stabilizer subgroup
oe(d) = o(d) of e, then it is obvious that

(e,h)be(u ) = be(hu )

is valid for each h  o(d). moreover, we have in general

hbe(u ) = b(h1

e (u )) = be(eh1

e u )

for each h  o(d + 1) and for each bounded convex set u  rd with
h1
e. the restriction e = |be of  to the c*-subalgebra
be is a reexion positive o(d)-invariant regular state.

e (u )  hsd

limit functionals. a convenient method for labeling the dif-
ferent scaling limit theories makes use of limit functionals[21] (for
the limit   0 in r+). these functionals are states  on the c*-
algebra of fb(r+) of all bounded functions on r+, which annihilate
the closed ideal f0(r+), which is generated by functions f  cb(r+)
indeed, for a function f  fb(r+) with
with lim0 f () = 0.
lim0 f () = f0, we nd < , f >= f0 for each limit functional
. since each limit functional can be regarded as a measure on the
spectrum of fb(r+), we write

< , f > = z d() f ()

in a suggestive manner.

5

taking scaling limits. we briey review here, how scaling limit
models can be constructed from the data (be, e, e). first, we con-
sider the c*-algebra of bounded b-valued functions on r+, fb(r+, b).
we introduce for a bounded convex set u  rd by be(u ) the c*-
subalgebra in fb(r+, b) which is generated by functions

 7 b() = z dh f (h) hbo()

such that b()  be(u ) for each . here f  c (o(d + 1)) is a
smooth function on o(d + 1) and dh is the haar measure on o(d + 1).
the c*-algebra which is generated by all local algebras be(u ) is be.
for a limit functional , we introduce the ideal j in be which consists
of those functions b for which the c*-seminorm

kbk = z d() kb()k

vanishes. the scaling algebra b(e,) is just given by the quotient be/j
and p denotes in the subsequent the corresponding canonical projec-
tion onto the quotient. we formally interpret b(e,) in terms of a direct
integral decomposition with respect to the measure  and we write

p[b] = z 

d() b() .

the local algebras are given by b(e,)(u ) := p[be(u )]. the group
homomorphism o

(e,) is given according to

o

(e,,h)p[b] = z 

d() hb()

for each h in the stabilizer subgroup oe(d). according to [21], there
exists a o(d)-invariant reexion positive state (e,) on b(e,) which is
uniquely determined by

h(e,), p[b]i = z d() he, b()i

for each b  be. we are now prepared to formulate the following
statement:

theorem 3.1 : there exists a group homomorphism (e,) from the
euclidean group e(d) into the automorphism group of b(e,) which acts
covariantly on the net b(e,) and which extends the homomorphism
o
(e,) such that the triple (b(e,), (e,), (e,)) is a euclidean eld on
rd.

6

sketch of the proof. we postpone the complete proof of the the-
orem to appendix b. we briey sketch here the main idea of the proof
which is quite simple. in order to construct an action of the translation
group in rd we make use of the rotations which do not leave the point
e stable. we choose a orthonormal basis (e0,    , ed) with e0 = e. let
l0 be the generator of the rotations in the plane spanned by e0, e
then for each  = 1,    , d an automorphism on b(e,) is given by

(e,,se)p[b] = z 

d() exp(sl0)b()

for each s  r+. indeed, it turns out that these automorphisms gen-
erate an action of the translation group. in addition to that it can be
shown that the automorphisms o
(e,,h), where h is in the stabilizer sub-
group of e, together with the automorphisms (e,,se),  = 1,    , d,
generate an action of the full euclidean group e(d) on b(e,).

this is exactly what one expects by looking at the geometrical
situation. taking the scaling limit at the point e can also be interpreted
as blowing up the sphere sd. heuristically, the spheres 1sd tend to
rd if the radius 1 becomes innite, i.e.   0, and the point e
is identied with the origin x = 0 in rd. during this limit process,
the stabilizer subgroup of e becomes the rotation group in rd and the
remaining rotations, generated by l0,  = 1,    , d, can be identied
with the translations in rd.

4 from efth on the sphere to qfth on
de sitter space

this section is devoted to an analogous construction procedure as in
[19] which relates a given euclidean eld (b, , ) on the sphere to a
quantum eld theory in de sitter spacetime.

according to our axioms, the map

b(e)  b(e)  b1  b2 7 h, je(b1)b2i

is a positive semidenite sesquilinear form. by dividing the null-space
and taking the closure we obtain a hilbert space h. the corresponding
canonical projection onto the quotient is denoted by

 : b(e) 7 h

and we write  := [1]. the construction of the observables, which
turn out to be bounded operators on h, can be performed in several
steps.

7

construction of a representation of so(d, 1). the con-
struction of a unitary strongly continuous representation u of so(d, 1)
can be performed by applying the the theory of virtual group repre-
sentations, as it has been worked out by j. frohlich, k. osterwalder,
and e. seiler [13], to our situation. this leads to the result:

theorem 4.1 : there exists a unitary strongly continuous represen-
tation u of the lorentz group so(d, 1) on h.

proof. a strongly continuous unitary representation w of the stabi-
lizer subgroup oe(d)  o(d, 1) of e can easily be constructed according
to

w (h)[b] = [hb]

where b is an operator in b(e).
in order to construct the lorentz
boosts, we introduce the regions (e,  ),   (0, /2), which is the
intersection (e,  )  sd, where (e,  ) is the o(d + 1) invariant cone
in e direction with opening angle 2 . we choose an orthonormal ba-
sis (e0,    , ed) with e = e0 and writing l0 for the generator of the
rotations in the plane spanned by e0, e, on obtains a vector valued
function

(b,)(is) = [exp(sl0)b]

which is dened for each b  b((e,  )) and for |s| <  . the function
(b,) has an holomorphic extension into the strip r + i(,  ).

assuming that the net v 7 b(v ) fullls weak additivity in the

sense that for each convex set v  sd we have

b =

[ho(d+1)

kk

b(hv )

,

then, as we show in the appendix a, the space d(e,  ) := [b((e,  ))]
is dense in h which allows to apply the results, shown in [13], directly
to our case. in fact, as it has been carried out in [13], the analytic
properties of one parameter groups of boosts can be exploit to get the
result: a unitary strongly continuous representation u of the loretz
group so(d, 1) is uniquely determined by

u (h) = w (h)

u (exp(tb))[b] = (b,)(t)

where h is an element of soe(d) and b is the generator of the lorentz
boosts leaving the wedge {x  rd+1||x0|  x} invariant. (cid:3)

8

construction of the local net of observables.
in order to
keep our technical assumptions as simple as possible we assume that
the euclidean net (b, ) fullls the time zero condition (tz). this
condition states that the c*-algebra is generated by the je-invariant
elements b  b(sd1
), which are contained in the intersection b(e) 
b(e), together with the transformed operators hb, h  o(d + 1).
the algebra b(sd1
) is represented by bounded operators on h where
the representation  is given as follows:

e

e

(b)[b1] = [bb1]

.

analogously to the situation in minkowski spacetime [19] we assign to
each bounded causally complete region o  dsd in d-dimensional de
sitter spacetime dsd the von neumann algebra a(o)  b(h) which is
generated by the bounded operators u (g)(b)u (g) where b is localized
in a convex set g of the time slice sd1
and gg  o. the c*-
algebra which is generated by all local algebras a(o) (o  dsd causally
complete and bounded) is denoted by a.

e

we also obtain a group homomorphism  form the lorentz group
so(d, 1) into the automorphism group auta by setting g := adu (g)
for each lorentz transformation g. by construction  acts covariantly
on the net o 7 a(o), i.e. for each causally complete region o in de
sitter space, the automorphism g maps the algebra a(o) onto a(go).

the geodesic kms condition. there is a canonical lorentz
invariant state  on a which is just given by h, ai := h, ai. for
a boost generator b we denote by wb := {x  dsd||x0|  x}
the intersection of the de sitter space dsd with the wedge in ambient
space associated to the boosts exp(sb). we also consider for a boost
generator b = b and the corresponding one-parameter group b of
automorphisms

(b,t)

:= exp(tb)

which obviously maps the algebra a(wb) onto itself and we get a w*-
dynamical system (a(wb), b).
in the subsequent we prove that 
fullls the geodesic kms condition which can be precisely formulated
by the theorem which is proven in appendix c:

theorem 4.2 : the restricted state |a(wb ) is a kms state with re-
spect to the w*-dynamical system (a(wb), b) at inverse temperature
2.

the modular conjugation associated with a wedge alge-
bra. the geodesic kms condition (theorem 4.2) implies that the

9

vector  is cyclic and separating for the wedge algebra a(wb) (com-
pare [22]). we build the modular conjugation jb as well as the mod-
ular operator b with respect to the pair (a(wb), ). we choose an
orthonormal basis (e0,    , ed) with e = e0.

for b = b the intersection hsd1

base of the wedge wb. the reexion e at the hyperplane e
contained in the stabilizer group of e = e0 and the prescription

(e0,e) := sd1

e0  hsd

e is the spatial
 is

jb[b] = [je (b)]

denes a anti-unitary operator jb, a pct operator, on h. following
the analysis, carried out in [22], one nds (see appendix d:

theorem 4.3 : the modular conjugation jb of the pair (a(wb), )
coincides with the pct operator jb:

jb = jb .

verication of the haag-kastler axioms. the statement
of theorem 4.3 can be used to verify the haag-kastler axioms for the
net o 7 a(o) in a very straight forward manner. we already know
that there exists a group homomorphism  form the lorentz group
so(d, 1) into the automorphism group of a which is covariant with
respect to the net structure, i.e. ga(o) = a(go) is valid for each
causally complete set o in de sitter space and for each g  so(d, 1).
it remains to be proven that locality is satised which is formulated in
the corollary:

corollary 4.4 : the net o 7 a(o) fullls locality, i.e. if o1 and o2
are spacelike separated regions in de sitter space, then the commutator
[a1, a2] = 0 vanishes for each a1  a(o1) and for each a2  a(o2).

proof. the geometric action of the pct operator jb implies that

jba(wb)jb = a(w 
b)

where w 
b is the causal complement of wb in de sitter space. since
jb coincides with the modular conjugation jb by theorem 4.3, we
conclude

a(w 

b) = a(wb)

.

(1)

the net o 7 a(o) is so(d, 1) covariant and thus equation (1) holds
true for each wedge region w in de sitter space. choosing w in such
a way that o1  w and o2  w , it follows that [a1, a2] = 0 for each
a1  a(o1)  a(w ) and for each a2  a(o2)  a(w ) = a(w ). (cid:3)

5 conclusion and outlook

conclusion: we have proposed to consider a nite volume eu-
clidean eld theory in d dimensions as a eld theory on the d-sphere
sd  rd+1. the corresponding euclidean net b carries a covariant
action of the d + 1-dimensional rotation group o(d + 1) and the func-
tional  is invariant under this action. for a given point e  sd on
the sphere and for a given limit functional , we have constructed the
scaling limit theory (b(e,), (e,), (e,)) at e. the invariance under
the stabilizer subgroup of e remains as a o(d) invariance of the state
(e,) whereas the translation invariance enter from the fact that the
underlying state  is invariant under the full group o(d + 1). this
leads to the result, we expected, namely that the scaling limit theory
of a euclidean eld theory on the sphere is a euclidean eld theory in
an innite volume.

moreover, we have discussed how to construct a quantum eld the-
ory (a, , ) in de sitter space form a given euclidean eld theory
(b, , ) on the sphere, by exploring the analytic structure of de sit-
ter space. in particular, we have proven that the reconstructed state
 fullls the so called geodesic kms condition, i.e.
for any geodesic
observer the state  looks like an equilibrium state.

outlook: alternatively, one can consider a euclidean eld theory
within a compact region   rd with boundary . the correspond-
ing euclidean net of c*-algebras u 7 b(u ) is then indexed by
convex regions u  rd. by choosing the region  rotationally invari-
ant, it makes sense to consider an action of the rotation group o(d)
by automorphisms (,h) on the algebra b. the axiom of o(d)- in-
variance and reexion positivity can analogously by formulated for a
state .

for a given limit point , the corresponding scaling limit theory
(b(,), (,), (,)) at x = 0   can be constructed. there are two
natural questions which one can ask within this context:

(1) is the scaling limit theory (b(,), (,), (,)) a euclidean eld
theory on rd, i.e. within an innite volume, where (,) is in-
variant under the full euclidean group e(d)?

(2) do the scaling limit theory (b(,), (,), (,)) depend on the

choice of boundary conditions at ?

a on a reeh-schlieder-type theorem for
local euclidean algebras.

regularity, reexion positivity, and the euclidean invariance of the
functional  imply certain analytic properties of correlation functions.
this leads to a reeh-schlieder-type theorem for local euclidean alge-
bras, by assuming that the net v 7 b(v ) fullls weak additivity in
the sense that for each convex set v  sd:

b =

[ho(d+1)

kk

b(hv )

.

theorem a.1 : for each bounded open convex set v  hsd
tained in half sphere hsd
h.

e con-
e the subspace d(v ) := [b(v )] is dense in

proof. the proof can be obtained by an application of a reeh-schlieder-
type argument. consider a unit vector e1, perpendicular to e. then
we dene linear operators

ve1 (s) : d(v )  h

according to

ve1 (s)[b] = [exp(slee1 )b]

for s  i(e1, v ), where the open interval i(v ) is given by

i(e1, v )

:= {s| exp(slee1 )v  hsd
e}

and lee1 denotes the generator of rotations in the plane spanned by
e, e1. one easily checks that ve1 (s) is symmetric, i.e.

h1, ve1 (s)2i = hve1 (s)1, 2i

for each 1, 2  d(v ) and we get

s 

lim

s0;si(e1,v )

ve1 (s1) = 

for each   d(v ). due to a theorem by j. frohlich [12] or by using
the results of a. klein and l. j. landau [16], the operators ve1 (s)
extends uniquely to self adjoint operators on h. this implies that the
vector valued function

is 7 ve1 (s)

13

has an holomorphic extension into the open strip r+ii(v ) for each  
d(v ). more general, for operators b1,    , bk  b(v ), the operator
valued function

[b1, ,bk;e1, ,ek] : i(s1,    , sk) 7 (cid:20) k
yj=1

exp(skleek )bk(cid:21)

has an holomorphic extension into the tube rk + ii(e1,    , ek, v ),
where the region i(e1,    , ek, v ) contains all points (s1,    , sk)  rk
such that

exp(s1lee1 )v (s2, e2;    ; sk, ek)  hsd

e .

the set v (s2, e2;    ; sk, ek) is recursively dened by

v (s2, e2;    ; sk, ek)

:= exp(s2lee2 )[v  v (s3, e3;    ; sk, ek)]

.

in particular, by construction i(e1,    , ek, v ) is an open connected
set.

let  be a vector in the orthogonal complement of d( v ), where
v is a slightly larger region than v . then we conclude that there is
an open connected subset j  i(e1,    , ek, v ) such that

h, [b1, ,bk;e1, ,ek](z)i = 0

for each z  rk + ij. since [b1, ,bk;e1, ,ek] is holomorphic in the
tube rk + ii(e1,    , ek, v ) we conclude

h, [b1, ,bk;e1, ,ek](z)i = 0

for all z  rk +ii(e1,    , ek, v ). by making use of the weak additivity
of the net, the set of vectors

(cid:26)[b1, ,bk;e1, ,ek](is) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

b1,    , bk  b(v ); s  i(e1,    , ek, v ), k  n(cid:27)

span a dense subspace in h which implies  = 0 and the theorem
follows. we mention here that a similar argument can also be found
in [15]. (cid:3)

b proof of theorem 3.1

we consider an orthonormal basis of rd+1, (e0,    , ed), e = e0. let
(ei,ej ) : s 7 (ei,ej ,s), be the one-parameter group of automorphisms,
related to the rotations in the ei  ej-plane. the corresponding gen-
erators in the lie algebra o(d + 1) are denoted by lij. for a scaling

14

parameter   r+ and for a bounded convex region u  rd we
consider the set g(, u )  r which consists of all s  r such that
exp(sl0)1
e. it is obvious that the denition is inde-
pendent of the choice of the coordinate direction  = 1,    , d and that
the inclusion g(, u )  g(, u ) is valid for  < . for a function
b  be(u ) we put

e (u )  hsd

[

(e,se)

b]()

:= (cid:26) exp(sl0)b()

b()

;
;

s  g(, u )

s 6 g(, u ) (cid:27)

which denes a function in fb(r+, b). in order to verify that 
b
(e,se)
is contained in be, we compute for x  u and for each s  g(, u )

[e exp(sl0)1

e (x)]

x

 cos(s)x + sin(s)(1  2x2)1/2

=  (cid:26)

cos(s)x + 1 sin(s)(1  2x2)1/2

x

;  6= 

;  =  (cid:27) .

we introduce the region

se u =

[:sg(,u )

1e exp(sl0)1

e (u )

which is compact since 1 sin(s)(1  2x2)1/2 = o(1). this implies
that 

b is contained in be(se u ) and the prescription

(e,se)

(e,,se)p[b] = p[

b]

(e,se)

yields a well dened automorphism of b(e,). analogously we dene
an automorphism (e,,s1e1 ++skek ) by replacing sl0 by s1l01 +
   + skl0k and we show that

(e,,s1e)(e,,s2e ) = (e,,s1e+s2e )

which implies that for x = p xe the assignment

x 7 (e,,x)

is indeed a group homomorphism form the translation group rd into
the automorphism group of b(e,). consider the function

b :  7 b() = z dh f (h) hbo()

then we get the estimate

let v be a nite dimensional linear space on which o(d + 1) is rep-
resented by unitary operators. we may assume that the function
f is given by f (h) = fv (hv) with v  v and fv  c 
0 (v ). a
straight forward computation shows that there exists a linear oper-
ator m ()  l(v ) with km ()k  const.2 such that

.

es1l0es2l0 e[s1l0+s2l0 ]hv = hv + m ()hv .

hence we conclude

which implies the desired result

for an element h of the stabilizer subgroup oe(d) one easily checks the
relation

(e,,h)(e,,x) = (e,,hx)o
o

(e,,h)

and the existence of the homomorphism (e,) follows. it remains to
be proven that (e,) acts covariantly on b(e,). let a bounded convex
set u  rd be given. according to equation (2) we conclude that
there exists r > 0 such that

1e exp(sl0)1

e (u )  (u + se) + bd(r)

for each   r+. here bd(r) is the closed ball in rd with center
x = 0 and radius r. this implies

(e,,se)b(e,)(u ) = b(e,)(u + se)

which proves the covariance. since the state (e,) is translationally in-
variant, which is due to the construction of (e,), the theorem follows.
(cid:3)

c proof of theorem 4.2

the main steps of the proof can be performed in complete analogy to
the the analysis of [22, 15]. we consider a family of operators b1,    , bn
which are contained in the time slice algebra, where bj  b(gj) is
localized in a convex subset gj  sd1
. let s 7 (j,s) be the
one-parameter automorphism group, corresponding to the rotations in
j 0 direction. this implies that (j,s)bj  b(hsd
e) for each s  (0, ).
let b be the boost in 0  0 direction, let l be the generator of the
rotations in the 0  0 plane, and let lj be the generator in the of the
rotations in the 0  j plane. we introduce the open subset in r2

 wbj

e

i(gj)

:= {(, s)  r2|j : exp(sl) exp( lj)vj  hsd
e}

which contains in particular the set {0}  (0, )  i(gj). by introduc-
ing the operators

bj(j )

:= vj (j)(bj )vj (j)

we obtain by an analogous computation as it has been carried out in
[22]:

hv (sn)bn(n)    v (sk+1)bk+1(k+1), v (sk)bk(k)   

   v (s1)b1(1)i

= hv (  (s1 +    + sk))b1(1)v (s1)b2(2)    v (sk1)bk(k),

 v (  (sk+1 +    + sn))bk+1(k+1)v (sk+1)bk+2(k+2)   

   v (sn1)bn(n)i

which expresses the kms condition at inverse temperature 2 in the
euclidean points. finally, a straight forward application of the analysis
of [15] proves the theorem. (cid:3)

d proof of theorem 4.3

by following the analysis of [15], we choose a family of operators
b1,    , bn which are contained in the time slice algebra, where bj 
b(gj) is localized in a convex subset gj  sd1
, and we
choose directions e0,    , en which are perpendicular to e. by using
the same notations as for the proof of theorem 4.2, we obtain by

 wbej

e

17

putting j := jb:

v (sk)bk(k)    v (s1)b1(1)

= v (sk)bk(k)v (sk)v (sk + sk1)bk1(k1)v (sk  sk1)   

   v (s1)b1(1)

= v (sk)bk(k)v (sk)    v (s1 +    + sk)b1(1)

= [bk(k, sk)    b1(1, s1 +    + sk)]

.

we compute for s1,    , sk  r+ and (i, sk +    + si)  i(gi) for
k  i  1:

j v (sk)bk(k)    v (s1)b1(1)

= [je0 (bk(k, sk)    b1(1, s1 +    + sk))]

= [b1(11,   (s1 +    + sk))    bk(kk,   sk)]

= v (  s1 +    + sk)b

1(11)v (s1)    b

k(kk)v (sk)

with j = 1 if ej  e0 and j = 1 if ej = e. performing an analytic
continuation within the parameter s1,    sk and 1,    , k and taking
boundary values at sj = j = 0 yields the relation (compare [15] as
well as [13] and [19])

jb(cid:20) k
yj=1
= v ()(cid:20) k
yj=1

u (exp(tjbej ))bj u (exp(tjbej ))(cid:21)

u (exp(tj bej ))bj u (exp(tjbej ))(cid:21)



which implies that the tomita operator is

jb1/2
b

= jbv () .

moreover, according to theorem 4.2, the automorphism group

b : t 7 ad[u (exp(tb))]

maps a(wb) into itself and the state |a(wb ) is a kms state at inverse
temperature 2 and the theorem follows. (cid:3)
