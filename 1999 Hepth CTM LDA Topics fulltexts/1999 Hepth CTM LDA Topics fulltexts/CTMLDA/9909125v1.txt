generalising ideas of an earlier work 16, we address the problem of constructing
brane box models of what we call the z-d type from a new point of view, so as
to establish the complete correspondence between these brane setups and orbifold
singularities of the non-abelian g generated by zk and dd under certain group-
theoretic constraints to which we refer as the bbm conditions. moreover, we
present a new class of n = 1 quiver theories of the ordinary dihedral group dk as
well as the ordinary exceptionals e6,7,8 which have non-chiral matter content and
discuss issues related to brane setups thereof.

1 introduction

congurations of branes 1 have been proven to be a very useful method to study the gauge eld theory which
emerges as the low energy limit of string theory (for a complete reference, see giveon and kutasov 2). the
advantage of such setups is that they provide an intuitive picture so that we can very easily deduce many
properties of the gauge theory. for example, brane setups have been used to study mirror symmetry in 3
dimensions 1,3,4,5,6, seiberg duality in 4 dimensions 7, and exact solutions when lifting type iia setups to
m-theory 8,9. after proper t- or s-dualities, we can transform the above brane setups to d-brane as probes
on some target space with orbifold singularities 10,11,12.

for example, the brane setup of streching type iia d4-branes between n + 1 ns5-branes placed in a
circular fashion (the elliptic model 8) is precisely t-dual to d3-branes stacked upon ale singularities of

the type can, or in other words orbifold singularities of the form c2/zn+1, where zn+1 is the cyclic group

on n + 1 elements and is a nite discrete subgroup of su (2). as another example, the brane box model
13,14,15 is t-dual to d3-branes as probes on orbifold singularities of the type c3/ with  = zk or zk  zk
now being a nite discrete subgroup of su (3) 14. a brief review of some of these contemporary techniques
can be found in our recent work 16. in fact, it is a very interesting problem to see how in general the two
dierent methods, viz., brane setups and d3-branes as probes on geometrical singularities, are connected to
each other by proper duality transformations 17.

the general construction and methodology for d3-branes as probes on orbifold singularities has been
given 12. however, the complete list of the corresponding brane setups is not yet fully known. for orbifolds

c2/{  su (2)}, we have the answer for the can series (i.e.,  = zn+1) and the cdn series (i.e.,  = dn2,
the binary dihedral groups) 6, but not for the exceptional cases de6,7,8. at higher dimensions, the situation

is even more disappointing: for orbifolds of c3/{  su (3)}, brane setups are until recently limited to only
abelian singularities, namely  = zk or zk  zk 14.

in a previous paper 16, we went beyond the abelian restriction in three dimensions and gave a new result
concerning the correspondence of the two methods. indeed we showed thatb for  := g = zk  dk a nite

the abstract presentation of the groups is as follows:

(1.2)

because of the non-abelian property of g, the preliminary attempts at the corresponding brane box
model by using the idea in a previous work 18 met great diculty. however, via careful analysis, we found
that the group g can be written as the semidirect product of zk and d kk
. furthermore, when

gcd(k,2k )

2k

gcd(k,2k) = even, the character table of g as the semidirect product zkd kk
of that of d kk

, in the sense that it seems to be composed of k copies of the latter. indeed, it was noted

preserves the structure

16 that only under this parity condition of
zk and d kk

gcd(k,2k )

, a consistent brane box model with the ideas in the abovementioned paper 18.

2k

gcd(k,2k) = even, can we construct, with the two group factors

the success of the above construction, constrained by certain conditions, hints that something fundamen-
tal is acting as a key role in the construction of non-abelian brane setups above two (complex) dimensions.
by careful consideration, it seems that the following three conditions presented themselves to be crucial in
the study of zk  dk which we here summarize:

1. the whole group g can be written as a semidirect product: zkdd;

2. the semidirect product of g preserves the structure of the irreducible representations of dd, i.e., it

appears that the irreps of g consist of k copies of those of the subgroup dd;

3. there exists a (possibly reducible) representation of g in 3 dimensions such that the representation
matrices belong to su (3). henceforth, we shall call such a representation, consistent with the su (3)
requirement (see more discussions 16,19 on decompositions), as the chosen decomposition of 3.

we will show in this paper that these conditions are sucient for constructing brane box model of the z-d
type. here we will call the brane box model in our recent paper 16 as type z-d and similarly, that in
earlier works 13,14 we shall call the z-z type. we shall see this denition more clearly in subsection 2.3. it
is amusing to notice that brane box models of type z-z also satisfy the above three conditions since they
correspond to the group zk  zk , which is a direct product.

furthermore, we shall answer a mysterious question posed at the end of our earlier work 16. in that
paper, we discussed the so-called inverse problem, i.e., given a consistent brane box model, how may one
determine, from the structure of the setup (the number and the positioning of the branes), the corresponding
group  in the orbifold structure of c3/. we found there that only when k is the divisor of d can we nd the
corresponding group dened in (1.1) with proper k, k. this was very unsatisfying. however, the structure
of the brane box model of type z-d was highly suggestive of the solution for general k, d. we shall here
mend that short-coming and for arbitrary k, d we shall construct the corresponding group  which satises

the symbol  and throughout the paper reserve  to mean strict direct product of groups and , the semi-direct product.

above three conditions. with this result, we establish the complete correspondence between the brane box
model of type z-d and d3-branes as probes on orbifold singularities of c3/ with properly determined .
the three conditions which are used for solving the inverse problem can be divided into two conceptual
levels. the rst two are at the level of pure mathematics, i.e., we can consider it from the point of view of
abstract group theory without reference to representations or to nite discrete subgroup of su (n). the third
condition is at the level of physical applications. from the general structure 12 we see that for constructing
n = 2 or n = 1 theories we respectively need the group  to be a nite subgroup of su (2) or su (3).
this requirement subsequently means that we can nd a faithful (but possibly reducible) 2-dimensional
or 3-dimensional representation with the matrices satisfying the determinant 1 and unitarity conditions.
in other words, what supersymmetry (n = 2 or 1) we will have in the orbifold theory by the standard
procedure 12 depends only on the chosen representation (i.e., the decomposition of 2 or 3). such distinctions
were already shown before 14,19. the group z3 had been considered 14. if we choose its action on c3 as
3 z2, z3) we will have n = 2 supersymmetry, but if we choose the action to be
(z1, z2, z3)  (e
(z1, z2, z3)  (e
3 z3) we have only n = 1. this phenomenon mathematically corresponds
3 z2, e
to what are called sets of transitivity of collineation group actions 20.

moreover, we notice that the ordinary dihedral group dk which is excluded from the classication of
nite subgroup of su (2) can be imbeddedc into su (3). therefore we expect that dk should be useful in
constructing some n = 1 gauge eld theories by the standard procedures 12,19. we show in this paper
that this is so. with the proper decompositions, we can obtain new types of gauge theories by choosing c3
orbifolds to be of the type dk. for completeness, we also give the quiver diagrams of ordinary tetrahedral,
octahedral and icosahedral groups (e6,7,8), which by a similar token, can be imbedded into su (3).

the organisation of the paper is as follows. in 2 we give a simple and illustrative example of constructing
a brane box model for the direct product zk  dk , whereby initiating the study of brane setups of what
we call type z-d. in 3 we deal with the twisted case which we encountered earlier 16. we show that we
can imbed the latter into the direct product (untwisted) case of 2 and arrive at another member of brane
box models of the z-d type. in 4 we give a new class of su (3) quiver which are connected to the ordinary
dihedral group dk. also, we give an interesting brane conguration that will give matter matter content as
the dk=even quiver but a dierent superpotential on the gauge theory level. finally in 5 we give concluding
remarks and suggest future prospects.

nomenclature

unless otherwise specied, we shall throughout the paper adhere to the notation that the group binary
operator  refers to the strict direct product, , the semi-direct product, and , a general (twisted) product
by combining the generators of the two operandsd. furthermore, n is dened to be e
n , the nth root of
unity; h  g mean that h is a normal subgroup of g; and a group generated by the set {xi} under relations
fi({xj }) = 1 is denoted as hxi|fji.

2i

2 a simple example: the direct product zk  dk

we recall that in a preceeding work 16, we constructed the brane box model (bbm) for the group zk  dk
as generated by (1.1), satifying the three conditions mentioned above, which we shall dub as the bbm

csince it is in fact a subgroup of su (2)/zz2 = so(3), the embedding is naturally induced from so(3)  su (3). in fact the

3-dimensional representation in su (3) is faithful.

dtherefore in the previous paper 16, the group g := zk  dk in this convention should be written as zk  dk , q.v. ibid.

for discussions on how these dierent group compositions aect brane constructions.

condition for groups. however, as we argued in the introduction, there may exist in general, groups not
isomorphic to the one addressed 16 but still obey these conditions. as an illustrative example, we start with
the simplest member of the family of z  d groups that satises the bbm condition, namely the direct
product g = zk  dk. we dene  as the generator for the zk factor and , , those for the dk . of course
by denition of the direct product  must commute with both  and . the presentation of the group is
clearly as follows:

k = 1;
2k
 = ,  = 

= 1,

k

= 2,

the cyclic group zk

 = 1; the binary dihedral group dk

mutual commutation

we see that the rst two of the bbm conditions are trivially satised. to satisfy the third, we need a 3-
dimensional matrix represenation of the group. more explicitly, as discussed 16, to construct the bbm of the
z-d type, one needs the decomposition of 3 into one nontrivial 1-dimensional irrep and one 2-dimensional
irrep. in light of this, we can write down the su (3) matrix generators of the group as

(2.3)

here, we notice a subtle point. when k = even, 

give the same matrix form. in other words,
(2.3) generates a non-faithful representation. we will come back to this problem later, but before diving into
a detailed discussion on the whole group zk  dk , let us rst give the necessary properties of the factor dk .

2.1 the group dk

one can easily check that all the elements of the binary dihedral dk = h, i group can be written, because
2 = k

, as

np, with n = 0, 1 p = 0, 1, ..., 2k  1.

from this constraint and the conjugation relation

(n1p1 )1(np)(n1p1 ) = np1(1(1)n)+(1)n1 p,

we can see that the group is of order 4k and moreover aords 4 1-dimensional irreps and (k1) 2-dimensional
irreps. the classes of the group are:

n=0 c p=k
c p=0
1
1

n=0
1
1

|c|
#c

cp
n=0 c p mod 2
2

n=1
k
2

k  1

to study the character theory of g := dk , we recognise that h := {p} for p even is a normal subgroup
of g. whence we can use the frobenius-cliord theory of induced characters to obtain the irreps of g from

the factor group eg := g/h = 1, , , . for k even, eg is z2  z2 and for k odd, it is simply z4. these

then furnish the 1-dimensional irreps. we summarise the characters of these 4 one dimensionals as follows:

k = even

k = odd

p=even (odd) (even) (odd)

even (odd) (even) (odd)

the 2-dimensional irreps can be directly obtained from the denitions; they are indexed by a single

integer l:

l

2(cn=1) = 0,

2(c p

n=0) = (lp

2k + lp

l = 1, .., k  1.

the general method of constructing gauge eld theories from orbifold singularities of c3/  su (3) has
been given 12,19. let us rst review briey the essential results. given a nite discrete subgroup   su (3)
with irreducible representations {ri}, we obtain, under the orbifold projection, an n = 1 super yang-mills
theory with gauge group

su (n |ri|),

|ri| = dim(ri), n  zz

oi

to determine the matter content we need to choose the decomposition of 3 (i.e., the 3  3 matrix form) of 
which describes how it acts upon c3. we use r to denote the representation of chosen 3 and calculate the
tensor decomposition

r  ri =mj

ar
ijrj

(2.5)

the matrix ar

ij then tells us how many bifundamental chiral multiplets of su (ni)  su (nj) there are
which transform under the representation (ni, nj), where ni := n |ri|. furthermore, knowing this matter
content we can also write down the superpotential whose explicit form is given in (2.7) and (2.8) of lawrence,
nekrasov and vafa 12. we do not need the detailed form thereof but we emphasize that all terms in the
superpotential are cubic and there are no quatic term. this condition is necessary for niteness 15,12 and we
will turn to this fact later.

5

we can encode the above information into a quiver diagram. every node i with index dim ri in the
quiver denotes the gauge group su (ni). then we connect ar
ij arrows from node i to j in order to denote the
correpsonding bifundamental chiral multiplet (ni, nj). when we say that a bbm construction is consistent
we mean that it gives the same quiver diagram as one obtains from the geometrical probe methods 12.

now going back to our example zk  dk, its character table is easily written: it is simply the kronecker

product of the character tables of zk and dk (as matrices). we promote (2.4) to a double index

(a, l
i)

to denote the charaters, where a = 0, ..., k  1 and are characters of zk (which are simply various kth roots
of unity) and  are the characters of dk as presented in the previous subsection. we recall that i = 1 or
2 and for the former, there are 4 1-dimensional irreps indexed by l = 1, .., 4; and for the latter, there are
k  1 2-dimensional irreps indexed by l = 1, .., k  1. it is not dicult to see from (2.3) that the chosen
decomposition should be:

the relevant tensor decomposition which gives the quiver is then

3  (2, 1

1)  (1, 1
2)

[(2, 1

1)  (1, 1

2)]  (a, l

i) = (a + 2, l

i)  (a  1, l

i  1

2),

(2.6)

which is thus reduced to the decompositions as tabulated in the previous subsection.

2.3 the brane box model of zk  dk

now we can use the standard methodology 14,16,18 to construct the bbm. the general idea is that for the
bbm corresponding to the singularity c3/, we put d-branes whose number is determined by the irreps of
 into proper grids in brane boxes constructed out of ns5-branes. then the genetal rule of the resulting
bbm is that we have gauge group su (ni) in every grid and bifundamental chiral multiplets going along
the north, east and southwest directions. the superpotential can also be read by closing upper or lower
triangles in the grids 14. the quiver diagram is also readily readable from the structure of the bbm (the
number and the positions of the branes).

indeed, in comparison with geometrical methods, because the two quivers (the orbifold quiver and the
bbm quiver) seem to arise from two vastly disparate contexts, they need not match a priori. however, by
judicious choice of irreps in each grid we can make these two quiver exactly the same; this is what is meant
by the equivalence between the bbm and orbifold methods. the consistency condition we impose on the
bbm for such equivalence is

3  ri =

m

j{north,east,southwest}

rj.

(2.7)

of course we observe this to be precisely (2.5) in a dierent guise.
now we return to our toy group zk  dk . the grids are furnished by a parallel set of k ns5-branes
with 2 on0 planes intersected by k (or k
2 when k is even; see explanation below) ns5-branes perpendicular
2 )  0 as before 16. this is shown in figure 1. the general
thereto and periodically identied such that k(or k
brane setup of this form involving 2 sets of ns5-branes and 2 on-planes we shall call, as mentioned in the
introduction, the bbm of the z-d type.

the irreps are placed in the grids as follows. first we consider the leftmost column. we place a pair of
irreps {(a, 1
1)} at the bottom (here a is some constant initial index), then for each incremental grid
going up we increase the index a by 2. now we notice the fact that when k is odd, such an indexing makes

the rst index has increment 2, while along the horizontal direction from left to right, the rst index has decrement 1 and the

second index, increment 1. the vertical direction is also periodically identied so that k( or k

one return to the bottom grid after k steps whereas if k is even, it suces to only make k
2 steps before one
returns. this means that when k is odd, the periodicity of a is precisely the same as that required by our
circular identication of the ns5-branes. however, when k is even it seems that we can not put all irreps
into a single bbm. we can circumvent the problem by dividing the irreps (a, ) into 2 classes depending
on the parity of a, each of which gives a bbm consisting of k
2 ns5-branes. we should not be surprised
at this phenomenon. as we mentioned at the beginning of this section, the matrices (2.3) generate a non-
). this non-faithful
faithful representation of the group when k is even (i.e., 
decomposition of 3 is what is responsible for breaking the bbm into 2 disjunct parts.

2 gives the same matrix as k

k

the same phenomenon appears in the zk  zk bbm as well. for k even, if we choose the decomposition
as 3  (1, 0) + (0, 1) + (1, 1) we can put all irreps into kk grids, however if we choose 3  (2, 0) +
(0, 1) + (2, 1) we can only construct two bbms each with kk
2 grids and consisting of one half of the total
irreps. indeed this a general phenomenon which we shall use later:

proposition 2.1 non-faithful matrix representations of  give rise to corresponding quiver graphs
which are disconnected.

having claried this subtlety we continue to construct the bbm. we have xed the content for the
leftmost column. now we turn to the bottom row. starting from the second column (counting from the left
) until we reach the right side (i.e., (aj, j
side) we place the irreps (a1, 1
2)
with j = 1, ...k  1) just prior to the rightmost column; there we place the pair {(a  k, 2
1)}.
for the remaining rows we imitate what we did for the leftmost column and increment, for the i-th column,
the rst index by 2 each time we ascend one row, i.e., (b, j
i ). the periodicity issues are as
discussed above.

our task now is to check the consistency of the bbm, namely (2.7). let us do so case by case. first we
1)}.

check the grid at the rst (leftmost) column at the i-th row; the content there is {(a + 2i, 1

then (2.7) dictates that

= (a + 2(i + 1), 1

1 or 3

1)  ((a + 2i)  1, 1
2)

by using the table of tensor decompositions in subsection 2.1 and our chosen 3 from (2.6). notice that the
rst term on the right is exactly the content of the box to the north and second term, the content of the
east. therefore consistency is satised. next we check the grid in the second column at the i-th row where
((a + 2i)  1, 1

2) lives. as above we require

= ((a + 2(i + 1))  1, 1

1)  (1, 1

[(2, 1
2)  ((a + 2i)  2, 2

1)  (a + 2(i  1), 3

whence we see that the rst term corresponds to the grid to the north, and second, east, and the last two,
southwest. we proceed to check the grid in the j + 1-th column (2  j  k  2) at the i-th row where
((a + 2i)  j, j

2) resides. again (2.7) requires that

= ((a + 2(i + 1))  j, j

where again the rst term gives the irrep the grid to the north, the second, east and the third, southwest.
next we check the grid in the k-th column and i-th row, where the irrep is ((a + 2i)  (k  1), k1
).
likewise the requirement is

2

[(2, 1

1)  (1, 1

2)]  ((a + 2i)  (k  1), k1

= ((a + 2(i + 1))  (k  1), k1
((a + 2i)  k, 4

)  ((a + 2i)  k, 2
1)
1)  ((a + 2(i  1))  (k  2), k2
)

2

2

whence we see again the rst term gives the grid to the north, the second and third, east and the fourth,
southwest. finally, for the last (rightmost) column, the grid in the i-th row has ((a + 2i)  k, 2
1) and
((a + 2i)  k, 4

1). we demand

[(2, 1

2)]  ((a + 2i)  k, 2

1)

= ((a + 2(i + 1))  k, 2

1 or 4

1)  ((a + 2(i  1))  (k  1), k1

2

))

where the rst term gives the grid to the north and the second term, southwest. so we have nished all
checks and our bbm is consistent.

from the structure of this bbm it is very clear that each row gives a dk quiver and the dierent rows
simply copies it k times according to the zk. this repetition hints that there should be some kind of direct
product, which is precisely what we have.

2.4 the inverse problem

now we address the inverse problem: given a bbm of type z-d, with k vertical ns5-branes bounded by
2 on0-planes and k horizontal ns5-branes, what is the corresponding orbifold, i.e., the group which acts
on c3? the answer is now very clear: if k is odd we can choose the group zk  dk or z2k  dk with the
action as dened in (2.3); if k is even, then we can choose the group to be z2k  dk with the same action.
in this above answer, we have two candidates when k is odd since we recall from discussions in 2.3 the
vertical direction of the bbm for the group z2k  dk only has periodicity k
2 and the bbm separates into
two pieces. we must ask ourselves, what is the relation between these two candidates? we notice that (2.3)
gives an non-faithful representation of the group z2k  dk . in fact, it denes a new group of which has the
faithful representation given by above matrix form and is a factor group of z2k  dk given by

8

g := (z2k  dk )/h, with h = h1, kk

i

(2.8)

in fact g is isomorphic to zk  dk . we can see this by the following arguments. denote the generators
of z2k  dk as , ,  and those of zk  dk as , , . an element of g can be expressed as [abn] 
[a+kb+k

n]. we then see the homomorphism from g to zk  dk dened by

[abn]  a ak+bn

is in fact an isomorphism (we see that [abn] and [a+kb+k
in proving this the k = odd condition is crucial).

n] are mapped to same element as required;

we see therefore that given the data from the bbm, viz., k and k, we can uniquely nd the c3 orbifold

singularity and our inverse problem is well-dened.

3 the general twisted case

we have found 16 that the group zk  dk (which in that paper we called zk  dk ) dened by (1.1) can
be written in another form as zkd kk
where it becomes an (internal) semidirect product. we would
like to know how the former, which is a special case of what we shall call a twisted groupe is related to the
direct product example, which we shall call the untwisted case, upon which we expounded in the previous
section.

gcd(k,2k )

the key relation which describes the semidirect product structure was shown 16 to be  = 

gcd(k,2k ) .
this is highly suggestive and hints us to dene a one-parameter family of groupsf g(a) := {zkdd} whose
presentations are

2k

 = ,

 = a.

(3.9)

when the parameter a = 0, we have g(0) = zk  dk as discussed extensively in the previous section.
gcd(k,2k) , g(a) is the group z  d treated in the previous paper 16. we are concerned with
also, when a =
members of {g(a)} that satisfy the bbm conditions and though indeed this family may not exhaust the list
of all groups that satisfy those conditions they do provide an illustrative subclass.

kk

3.1 preserving the irreps of dd

we see that the rst of the bbm conditions is trivially satised by our denition (3.9 of g(a) := zkdd.
therefore we now move onto the second condition. we propose that g(a) preserves the structure of the
irreps of the dd factor if a is even. the analysis had been given in detail 16 so here we only review briey.
deducing from (3.9) the relation, for b  zz,

(b)1 = b+a,

we see that b and b+a belong to the same conjugacy class after promoting dd to the semidirect product
zkdd. now we recall from subsection 2.1 that the conjugacy classes of dd are 0, d, p(p 6= 0, d),
even and odd. therefore we see that when a = even, the conjugacy structure of dd is preserved since
therein b and b+a, which we saw above belong to same conjugate class in dd, are also in the same
conjugacy class in g(a) and everything is ne. however, when a = odd, they live in two dierent conjugacy

eas mentioned in the nomenclature section,  generically denotes twisted products of groups.
f we note that this is unambiguously the semi-direct product : dening the two subgroups d := h, i and z := hi, we

see that g(a) = dz as cosets, that d  g(a) and d  z = 1, whereby all the axioms of semi-directness are obeyed.

9

classes at the level of dd but in the same conjugacy class in g(a) whence violating the second condition.
therefore a has to be even.

3.2 the three dimensional representation

now we come to the most important part of nding the 3-dimensional representations for g(a), i.e., condition
3. we start with the following form for the generators

where x, y  zz are yet undetermined integers (notice that the form (3.11) is xed by the matrix (3.10) of 
and the algebraic relation  = ). using the dening relations (3.9) of g(a), i.e relation  = a, we
immediately have the following constraint on x and y:

which has integer solutions g only when

k = a

k = (

with the actual solution being

x  y =

l.

(3.12)

(3.13)

equation (3.13) is a nontrivial condition which signiess that for arbitrary k, 2d, a, the third of the bbm
conditions may be violated, and the solution, not found. this shows that even though g(a = even) satises
the rst two of the bbm conditions, they can not in general be applied to construct bbms of type z-d
unless (3.13) is also respected. however, before starting the general discussion of those cases of z  d where
(3.13) is satised, let us rst see how the group treated before 16 indeed satises this condition.

for zk  dk 16 and dened by (1.1), let 1 := gcd(k, 2k). we have d = kk
1

(3.1) in that paper. therefore  = gcd(a, 2d) = a and k = 2d
have the solution x  y = 1. now if we choose y = 0, then we have

combining with the matrices in (3.10), we see that they generate a faithful 3-dimensional representation
of zk  dk . it is easy to see that what they generate is in fact isomorphic to a group with matrix generators,
as given in (2.3),

gcd(k,2k )

by noticing that 1

in (3.15) is precisely (3.14). but this is simply a non-faithful representation
, our direct product example! furthermore, when k = odd, by recalling the results

of z2k  dd= kk
of 2.4 we conclude in fact that the group zk  dk is isomorphic to zk  dd. however, for k = even,
although zk  dk is still embeddable into z2k  dd= kk
with a non-faithful representation (2.3), it is
not isomorphic to zk  dd and the bbm thereof corresponds to an intrintically twisted case (and unlike
when k = odd where it is actually isomorphic to a direct product group). we emphasize here an obvious but
crucial fact exemplied by (2.8): non-faithful representations of a group a can be considered as the faithful
representation of a new group b obtained by quotienting an appropriate normal subgroup of a. this is what
is happening above. this explains also why we have succeeded 16 in constructing the bbm only when we
wrote zk  dk in the form zkdd= kk

gcd(k,2k )

.

gcd(k,2k )

now let us discuss the general case. we recall from the previous subsection that a has to be even; we

thus let a := 2m. with this denition, putting (3.12) into (3.11,) we obtain for the quantity m:

 = m =

(3.16)

gcd(k,2k )

this  generates a cyclic group zk and combined with (3.10) gives the direct product group of zk  dd,
but with a non-faithful representation as in (2.3). therefore for the general twisted case, we can obtain the
bbm of z-d type of g(a) by imbedding g(a) into a larger group zk  dd which is a direct product just
like we did for zk  dk embeding to zkdd= kk
two paragraphs before, and for which, by our etude
in 2, a consistent bbm can always be established. however, we need to emphasize that in general such an
embedding (3.16) gives non-faithful representations so that the quiver diagram of the twisted group will be
a union of disconnected pieces, as demanded by proposition 2.1, each of which corresponds to a type z-d
bbm. we summarise these results by stating
proposition 3.2 the group g(a) := zk  dd satises the bbm conditions if a is even and the relation
(3.13) is obeyed. in this case its matrices actually furnish a non-faithful representation of a direct product
g := zk  dd and hence aords a bbmh of type z-d.
this action of g(a)  g is what we mean by embedding. we conclude by saying that the simple example
of 2 where the bbm is constructed for untwisted (direct-product) groups is in fact general and type z-d
bbms can be obtained for twisted groups by imbedding into such direct-product structures.

4 a new class of su (3) quivers

it would be nice to see whether the ideas presented in the above sections can be generalised to give the
bbm of other types such as type z-e, z-d or d-e whose denitions are obvious. moreover, e refers to the

exceptional groups de6,7,8 and d the ordinary dihedral group. indeed, we must rst have the brane setups

for these groups. unfortunately as of yet the e groups still remain elusive. however we will give an account
of the ordinary dihedral groups and the quiver theory thereof, as well as the ordinary e groups from a new
perspectively from an earlier work 19. these shall give us a new class of su (3) quivers.

hthough possibly disconnected with the number of components depending on the order of an abelian subgroup h  g.

11

we note that, as pointed out 19, the ordinary di-, tetra-, octa- and iscosa-hedral groups (or d, e6, 7, 8
respectively) are excluded from the classication of the discrete nite subgroups of su (2) because they
in fact belong to the centre-modded group so(3) = su (2)/zz2. however due to the obvious embedding
so(3)  su (3), these are all actually su (3) subgroups. now the d-groups were not discussed before 19
because they did not have non-trivial 3-dimensional irreps and are not considered as non-trivial (i.e., they
are fundamentally 2-dimensional collineation groups) in the standard classication of su (3) subgroups; or in
a mathemtical language 20, they are transitives. moreover, e6 is precisely what was called (3  22) earlier
19, e7, (6  22) and e8, 60 and were discussed there. however we shall here see all these groups together
under a new light, especially the ordinary dihedral group to which we now turn.

4.1 the group dk

the group is dened as

k

= 2 = 1,

 = 1,

and diers from its binary cousin dk in subsection 2.1 only by having the orders of ,  being one half of
the latter. indeed, dening the normal subgroup h := {1, k

}  dk we have

dk = dk /h.

we can subsequently obtain the character table of dk from that of dk by using the theory of subduced
representations, or simply by keeping all the irreps of dk which are invariant under the equivalence by h.
the action of h depends on the parity of k. when it is even, the two conjugacy classes (even) and (odd)
remain separate. furthermore, the four 1-dimensional irreps are invariant while for the 2-dimensionals we
must restrict the index l as dened in subsection 2.1 to l = 2, 4, 6, ..., k  2 so as to observe the fact
that the two conjugacy classes {a, a} and {ka, ak} combine into a single one. all in all, we have
4 1-dimensional irreps and k2
2-dimensionals. on the other hand, for k odd, we have the two classes
(even) and (odd) collapsing into a single one, whereby we can only keep 1, 3 in the 1-dimensionals
and restrict l = 2, 4, 6, ..., k  1 for the 2-dimensionals. here we have a total of 2 1-dimensional irreps and
k1

2

2-dimensionals.

4.2 a new set of quivers

now we must choose an appropriate su (3) decomposition of the 3 for our group in order to make physical
sense for the bifundamentals. the choice is

3  3

1 + 2
2.

here, we borrow the notation of the irreps of dk from dk in 2.1. the relationship between the irreps
of the two is discussed in the previous subsection. the advantage of using this notation is that we can
readily use the tabulated tensor decompositions of dk in 2.1. with this chosen decomposition, we can
immediately arrive at the matter matrices aij and subsequent quiver diagrams. the k = even case gives a

quiver which is very much like the ane ddk+2 dynkin diagram, diering only at the two ends, where the

nodes corresponding to the 1-dimensionals are joined, as well as the existence of self-joined nodes. this is
of course almost what one would expect from an n = 2 theory obtained from the binary dihedral group as
a nite subgroup of su (2); this clearly reects the intimate relationship between the ordinary and binary
dihedral groups. the quiver is shown in figure 2. on the other hand, for k odd, we have a quiver which
looks like an ordinary dk+1 dynkin diagram with 1 extra line joining the 1-nodes as well as self-adjoints.
this issue of the dichotomous appearance of ane and ordinary dynkin graphs of the d-series in brane
setups has been raised before 18,16. the diagram for k odd is shown in figure 3.

for completeness and comparison we hereby also include the 3 exceptional groups of so(3)  su (3).
for these, we must choose the 3 to be the unique (up to automorphism among the conjugacy classes)
3-dimensional irrep. any other decompostion leads to non-faithful representations of the action and subse-
quently, by our rule discussed earlier, to disconnected quivers. this is why when they were considered as
su (2)/zz2 groups with 3  1  2 chosen, uninteresting and disconnected quivers were obtained 19. now
under this new light, we present the quivers for these 3 groups in figure 4.

there are two points worth emphasising. all the above quivers correspond to theories which are nite
and non-chiral. by nite we mean the condition 12 for anomaly cancelation, that the matter matrix ar

what this mean graphically is that for each node, the sum of the indices of all the neighbouring nodes owing
thereto (i.e., having arrows pointing to it) must equal to the sum of those owing therefrom, and must in
fact, for an n = 1 theory, be equal to 3 times the index for the node itself. we observe that this condition
is satised for all the quivers presented in figure 3 to figure 4.

on the other hand by non-chiral we mean that for every bi-fundamental chiral multiplet (ni, nj) there
exists a companion (nj, ni) (such that the two combine together to give a bi-fundamental hypermultiplet in
the sense of n = 2). graphically, this dictates that for each arrow between two nodes there exists another
in the opposite direction, i.e., the quiver graph is unoriented. strangely enough, non-chiral matter content
is a trademark for n = 2 theories, obtained from c2/  su (2) singularities, while n = 1 usually aords
chiral (i.e., oriented quivers) theories. we have thus arrived at a class of nite, non-chiral n = 1 super
yang-mills theories. this is not that peculiar because all these groups belong to so(3) and thus have real
representations; the reality compel the existence of complex conjugate pairs. the more interesting fact is
that these groups give quivers that are in some sense in between the generic non-chiral su (2) and chiral
su (3) quiver theories. therefore we expect that the corresposnding gauge theory will have better properties,
or have more control, under the evolution along some energy scale.

4.3 an interesting observation

having obtained a new quiver, for the group dk, it is natural to ask what is the corresponding brane setup.
furthermore, if we can realize such a brane setup, can we apply the ideas in the previous sections to realize
the bbm of type z-d? we regrettably have no answers at this stage as attempts at the brane setup have
met great diculty. we do, however, have an interesting brane conguration which gives the correct matter
content of dk but has a dierent superpotential. the subtle point is that dk gives only n = 1 supersymmetry

figure 5: the brane conguration which gives the same matter content as the dk=even quiver.

and unlike n = 2, one must specify both the matter content and the superpotential. two theories with the
same matter content but dierent superpotential usually have dierent low-energy behavior.

we now discuss the brane conguration connected with dk, which turns out to be a rotated version
of the conguration for dk as given by kapustin 6 (related examples 16,21 on how rotating branes breaks
supersymmetry further may be found).
in particular we rotate all ns5-branes (along direction (12345))
between the two on0-plane as drawn in figure 1 of kapustin 6 to ns5-branes (along direction (12389)).
the setup is shown in figure 5. let us analyse this brane setup more carefully. first when we end d4-branes
(extended along direction (1236)) on the on0-plane, they can have two dierent charges: positive or negtive.
with the denition of the matrix

 =  1k+k+

0

0

1kk ! ,

the projection on the chan-paton matrix of the d4-branes is as follows. the scalar elds in the d4-
worldvolume are projected as

 = 1

and i = i1

where  runs from 4 to 5 and describes the oscillations of the d4-branes in the directions parallel to the
on0-plane while i runs from 7 to 9 and describes the transverse oscillations.
if we write the scalars as
matrice in block form, the remaining scalars that survive the projection are

 =  uk+k+

0

0

ukk ! and i = 

0

uk+k

ukk+

0

! .

from these we immediately see that  give scalars in the adjoint representation and i, in the bifun-
damental representation. next we consider the projection conditions when we end the other side of our
d4-brane on the ns-brane. if we choose the ns5-brane to extend along (12345), then the scalars  will be
kept while i will be projected out and we would have an n = 2 dk quiver (see figure 6).

however, if we choose the ns5-branes to extend along (12389), then  and i=7 will be projected out
while i=8,9 will be kept. it is in this case that we see immediately that we obtain the same matter content
as one would have from a dk=even orbifold discussed in the previous subsection (see figure 7).

now we explain why the above brane conguration, though giving the same matter content as the
dk=even, is insucient to describe the full theory. the setup in figure 5 is obtained by the rotation of
ns-branes to ns-branes; in this process of rotation, in general we change the geometry from an orbifold to
a conifold. in other words, by rotating, we break the n = 2 theory to n = 1 by giving masses to scalars
in the n = 2 vector-multiplet. after integrating out the massive adjoint scalar in low energies, we usually
get quartic terms in the superpotential (for more detailed discussion of rotation see erlich et al. 21). indeed
klebanov and witten 22 have explained this point carefully and shows that the quartic terms will exist even
at the limiting case when the angle of rotation is 
2 and the ns5-branes become ns5-branes. on the other

hand, the superpotential for the orbifold singularity of dk contains only cubic terms as required by lawrence
et al. 12 and as we emphasized in 2. it still remains an intersting problem to construct consistent brane
setups for dk that also has the right superpotential; this would give us one further stride toward attacking
non-abelian brane congurations.

5 conclusions and prospects

as inspired by the brane box model (bbm) constructions 16 for the group zk  dk generated by (1.1),
we have discussed in this paper a class of groups which are generalisations thereof. these groups we have
called the twisted groups (that satisfy bbm conditions). in particular we have analysed at great length,
the simplest memeber of this class, namely the direct product zk  dd, focusing on how the quiver theory,
the bbm construction as well as the inverse problem (of recovering the group by reading the brane setup)
may be established. the brane conguration for such an example, as in figure 1, we have called a bbm of
type z-d; consisting generically of a grid of ns5-branes with the horizontal direction bounded by 2 on-
planes and the vertical direction periodically identied. we have also addressed, as given in proposition 2.1
the issue of how non-faithful representations lead to disconnected quivers graphs, or in other words several
disjunct pieces of the bbm setup.

what is remarkable is that the twisted groups, of which the one in our recent paper 16 is a special case,
can under certain circumstances be embedded into a direct product structure (by actually furnishing a non-
faithful representation thereof). this makes our nave example of zk  dd actually possess great generality
as the twisted cases untwist themselve by embedding into this, in a sense, universal cover in the fashion
of proposition 3.2. what we hope is that this technique may be extended to address more non-abelian
singularities of c3, whereby the generic nite discrete group g  su (3) maybe untwisted into a direct-
product cover. in order to do so, it seems that g needs to obey a set of what we call bbm conditions. we
state these in a daring generality: (1) that g maybe written as a semi-direct product ab, (2) that the
structure of the irreps of g preserves those of the factors a and b and (3) that there exists a decomposition
into the irreps of g consistent with the unitarity and determinant 1 constraints of su (3).

indeed it is projected and hoped, with reserved optimism, that if a, b are su (2) subgroups for which
a brane setup is known, the techniques presented above may inductively promote the setup to a bbm (or
perhaps even brane cube for su (4) singularities). bearing this in mind, we proceeded further to study more
examples, hoping to attack for example, bbms of the z-d type where d is the ordinary dihedral group.
therefrom arose our interest in the ordinary groups d, e6,7,8 as nite subgroups of so(3)  su (3). these
gave us a new class of quiver theories which have n = 1 but non-chiral matter content. brane setups
that reproduce the matter content, but unfortunately not the superpotential, have been established for the
ordinary dihedral groups. these give an interesting brane conguration involving rotating ns5-brane with
respect to on-planes.

of course much work remains to be done. in addition to nding the complete brane setups that reproduce
the ordinary dihedral quiver as well as superpotential, we have yet to clarify the bbm conditions for groups
in general and head toward that beacon of brane realisations of non-abelian orbifold theories.
