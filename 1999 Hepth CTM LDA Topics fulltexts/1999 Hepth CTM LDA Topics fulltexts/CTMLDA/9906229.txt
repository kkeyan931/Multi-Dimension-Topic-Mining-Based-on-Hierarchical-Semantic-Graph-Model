with: dont any, or: operators dont determinants! even simple question dare ask reader (which she/he may choose ask colleague turn) following: value determinant minus identity operator innite dimensional space? followed by: determinant qnn (1)n? actually equal 2 product separate determinants plus 1s minus 1s? contribution point specic situations, become common lore already appeared recently literature, concerning concept determinant qft, try give reasonable answers questions last ones. 2. innite series (almost) trivial determinants mathematical theory divergent series fruitful taming innites appeared qft, begining conception. role essential, least rst stage regularization/renormalization procedure. euler borel summation methods, analytic continuation techniques commonly used. diculties exist inherent theory divergent series (see, instance, ). one well known fact that, sometimes, using dierent schemes, dierent results obtained. well posed physical situation, right one choosen experimental validation. another problem understand, physical terms, doing, performing say analytic continuation one region complex plane another . prevented e.g.the zeta function regularization procedure getting general aceptance among common physicists. situation concerning innite determinants even worse, sense. book subject compared, instance, mentioned one hardy see every day dubious manipulations performed level eigenvalues, translated determinant elevated sometimes cathegory standard results lore theorems. rst problem denition determinant itself. let quote respect recent paper e. witten {$9903005$}: determinant dirac operator dened roughly det = yi i, (1) innite product regularized (for example) zeta function pauli-villars regularization. zeta function denition determinant detd = exp  , (2) maybe one rm mathematical grounds . spite starting identity: log det = tr log, known develop called multiplicative anomaly: 3 determinant product two operators equal, general, product determinants (even operators commute!). happens already simple operators (as two one-dimensional harmonic oscillators diering constant term, laplacians plus dierent mass terms, etc.). may look incredible, rst sight, tr log property additivity trace, must take account zeta trace ordinary trace (for involves regularization), namely: trd = d(1), (3) tr(a + b) 6= tra + trb, general. understand originated con- siderable amount errors specialized literature falsely attributed missfunctions rigorous elegant zeta function method! example, consider following commuting linear operators innite-dimensional space, given diagonal form by: o1 = diag (1, 2, 3, 4, . . .), o2 = diag (1, 1, 1, 1, . . .) i, sum o1 + o2 = diag (2, 3, 4, 5, . . .). corresponding -traces easily obtained: 1 12 tro2 = r(0) = 1 2 , tro1 = r(1) = tr(o1 + o2) = r(1) 1 = , 13 12 , (4) (5) (6) last trace calculated according rules innite series summation (see e.g., hardy ). observe tr(o1 + o2) tro1 tro2 = 1 2 6= 0. (7) happens simple situation, involving identity operator, one easily imagine precaution one take manipulating innite sums might turn insucient. moreover, since multiplicative anomaly pointed originates precisely failure addition property regularized trace, already guess also show simple situations, proven, fact. appearance multiplicative anomaly prevents, particular, naive 4 manipulations eigenvalues determinant, reorderings splittings, number physicists seem aware of. warming up, let us calculate simple determinants zeta function method. start with, take 1 = yn=1 n. 1(s) = xn=1 ns = r(s), r (0) = 1 2 log(2), 1 = exp(cid:20) 1 2 log(2)(cid:21) = 2, nice result. way, obtain 2 = yn=1 n1 = 1 2 2(s) = r(s) expected. let us consider apparently simple case: 3 = yn=1 . (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) poses problem zeta function method, must modied somehow cope situation. fact, corresponding zeta function, 3(s) = xn=1 s, (13) abscissa convergence complex plane (since sequence eigenvalues neither increasing decreasing. be, however, naturally solved follows: taking logarithms (what inherent denition zeta function method) using rules innite series, plain result log 3 = log xn=1 1 = 1 2 log , (14) factor front log may interpreted zeta measure set positive natural numbers, thus 3 = yn=1 = 1 2 . 5 (15) leads, particular, following results: 4 = yn=1 1 = 1 1 2 = 1, determinant identity operator, i, 5 = yn=1 (1) = (1) 1 2 = i, (16) (17) determinant operator i. seems clear determinant identity operator 1, tells us (by choice everywhere determination logarithm complex plane) determinant and, i, inverse corresponding square root (15). notice that, way, starting build set consistency rules reminiscent, manner, corresponding rules innite series . this, use logarithm, ordinary rules innite series appliable series logs eigenvalues, particular, ones concerning multiplication common factor (used already), splitting nite number rst terms series (that say, nite number rst factors determinant). however, splitting innite number terms whole series two allowed general. is, again, lesson learned existence multiplicative anomaly determinant evaluated zeta function procedure. additional comment order: dealing innite series always take logarithms, introduces ambiguity zeta function denition determinant. fact well known  common regularization methods (as pauli-villars), dierent disguises. duely taken care sticking one determination logarithm whole calculation. apparent problem virtue perhaps? zeta function denition innite determinants posed following example. turns determinants 6 = yn=1 (1)2n+1, 7 = yn=1 (1)4n+1, . . . (18) 5 dierent. originates 11 6(1) = 2h(1, 1/2) 1 = b2(1/2) 1 = 12 23 7(1) = 4h(1, 1/4) 1 = 2b2(1/4) 1 = 24 , , . . . (19) 6 interpreted due change zeta measure number factors product leading determinant. could try avoid problem sticking always simple characterization eigenvalues series (in case 1,1,1, . . ., reference n superuous). things are, regretfully, simple. consider determinants 4, 5, 8 = yn=1 (1)n, try make compatible apparently obvious fact that: 8 = q45. (20) (21) determinant 8 obtained three dierent ways, yield result. (i) have, corresponding zeta function, 1 , (1)s 1 xn=1 8(s) = (1)ns = (s) = log(1)(cid:20) 1 8 = exp = (1)1/12. (22) (ii) hand, taking logs before, zeta function measure set exponents, get log 8 = log(1) 8 = (1)r(1) = (1)1/12. xn=1 n = log(1)r(1), (23) (iii) also, may instead choose take derivatives, term term, rst expression zeta function (1)ns, 8(s) = xn=1 (s) = xn=1 8 = exp = (1)1/12. (0) = log(1) xn=1 n = log(1) 12 , (24) remarkably enough, three cases obtain result determinant. let us try fulll factorization condition (21). have: 4 = 8 = yn=1 yn=1 5 = 1 = 11/2 = 1, (1)n = (1)1/12 = q45 = 11/4 (1)1/4. (1) = (1)1/2 = i, yn=1 (25) 7 way fulll property (21) accept that: yn=1 1 = 1 !! (26) contrary, insists (as almost everybody would agree on) determinant identity 1, must give property determinant alternating series eigenvalues 1,1, 1,1, . . . equal subdeterminant product 1s, times subdeterminant product 1s. simple reection one could ever expected obtain multiplicative anomaly determinant! choose preserve, price, multiplication property determinant give sense strange fact det = 1, attain compatibility eqs. (25) setting: yn=1 1 = ei, yn=1 (1) = ei/2, yn=1 (1)n = e3i/4, yn=1 (1)4n = e3i, . . . (27) compatible zeta function denitions determinant (they xed acceptable roots 1 1 given zeta function exponents) satisfying multiplication rule. however, easy see process cannot go ever (and thus eliminate anomaly): following dets cannot possibly fulll multiplicative property: yn=1 (1)2n+1 = (1)11/12 6= yn=1 (1)2n yn=1 (1). (28) maybe asking much, observed before, case still left compatible (albeit really weird) choice (27). anyhow, easy check nd problems factorizations like yn=1 (n) = yn=1 (1) yn=1 n, (29) since (s) = (1)sr(s), yn=1 (0) = (n) = e (0) = (1)1/2 2 = 1 2 log(2), 1 2 n, (30) log(1) yn=1 (1) yn=1 involved one yn=1 (1)nn = yn=1 (1)n yn=1 n, (31) 8 (s) = xn=1 (1)nsns = ((1)s, s), (1)nn = e (0) = (1)1/12 2 = yn=1 (0) = 12 + (0, 1) = 12 1 2 log(2), yn=1 (1)n yn=1 n, (32) polylogarithm function. factorization determinants holds again, zeta function prescription, fact seem immediate, view last calculation compared before. considerations may sound rather trivial, actually not, carefully taken account proceding sort manipulations eigenvalues splittings determinants pervade specialized literature. 3. multiplicative anomaly dirac type operators consider ordinary dirac equation massive spinor (/d + im) = 0. (33) usually, determinant dirac operator acting equation obtained using following argument (see, e.g., ): det(/d + im) = det(/d im) = hdet(/d2 + m2)i1/2 . (34) comes fact spectrum dirac massless operator /d following property: belongs spectrum, , immediately obtained use 5 operator. then, turns rst det eq. (34) product pairs form: ( + im)( + im) = ( im)( im) = ( im)( im), (35) last pairs appearing second det eq. (34). algebraic argument, also corresponding geometric one, trivial representing spectral points complex plane. thus, rst equality (34) proven, second seems obvious. however, due existence multiplicative anomaly innite determinants , formulas, obtained simple manipulation eigenvalues, must set suspicion need 9 rigorous check. concerning eq. (34, second equality cannot taken granted, since may turn det 6= det(/d + im) det(/d im). (36) show indeed case, simple, parallel example completely control uses operator square root harmonic oscillator. indeed, consider square root harmonic oscillator obtained delbourgo ref. . example potentially interesting physical applications, well known fermion external constant electromagnetic eld similar spectrum (landau spectrum). exactly way going klein-gordon dirac equation paying price doubling number components (e.g., introducing spin), delbourgo constructed model exists square root hamiltonian, close one harmonic oscillator. fact dierent dirac oscillator introduced several authors, corresponding minimal substitution ~p ~p i~r. main dierence lies introduction parity operator, q. whereas creation destruction operators harmonic oscillator, = p ix, non-hermitian, combinations = p iqx hermitian h (d)2 = p 2 + x 2 q = 2hosc q. (37) notice parity term commutes hosc. doubling components (i pauli matrices) x operators represented p i1 , x 1x, q 2, i1 x 3x. (38) (39) sequel, consider operator d+. eigenfunctions eigenvalues, respectively, n (x) = iex2/2 q2n+1 (n 1)! ihhn1(x) hn(x)/2ni hhn1(x) hn(x)/2ni , n = 2n, n 1, 0(x) = ex2/2 q2 1 , 10 0 = 0, (40) hn(x) hermite polinomials. two operators shall consider calculation anomaly = + v b = v , v real, constant potential |v | < 2, goes multiplied identity matrix two (spinorial) dimensions (omitted here). obviously, v identied mass m, make contact case dirac equation begining. notice + v v hermitian, commuting operators. multiplicative anomaly dened a(a, b) = log det(ab) log det log det b = (0) + b (0) ab (0). zeta function operator reads d(s) = xi = xn=1 (cid:16)2n(cid:17)s = 2s/2r(s/2), (41) (42) r(s) usual riemann zeta function, simple pole = 1. zeta function operators v (see, instance, ) dv (s) = xi (i v )s = d(s) + xn=1 (v )n(n + s) n! (s) d(n + s). (43) finally, zeta function operator (d + v )(d v ) = d2 v 2 given by: d2v 2(s) = d(2s) + xn=1 n! (s) v 2n(n + s) d(2n + 2s). (44) see anomaly simple case obtained terms derivatives riemann zeta function. important fact turns non-zero: a(d + v,d v ) = 2v 2. (45) point result obtained wodzicki formula anomaly, even working non-compact manifold . thus simple example presence non-trivial anomaly operators degree one space dimension one (spinorial, however). one argue mass term absorbed renormalization nally yield physical contribution. notice, however, situation much general specic case considered here, which, however, even simplicity already accounts kind terms depending space-time coordinates. thus v represent aside mass term im constant magnetic eld, nite temperature term, chemical potential. anomalous contributions kind cannot absorbed renormalization (see, e.g., ) acquire direct physical meaning . 11 acknowledgments author indebted andreas wipf sergio zerbini enlightening discussions members institutes theoretical physics universities jena trento, main part work done, warm hospitality. investigation supported dgicyt (spain), project pb96-0925, cirit (generalitat de catalunya), italian-spanish program infncicyt, german-spanish program acciones integradas, project ha1997-0053.
