abstract

we give a basic account of supersymmetric open strings and d-branes using
the green-schwarz formalism, obtaining a manifestly spacetime supersymmetric
description of their spectrum. in addition we discuss a mechanism whereby some
of the d-brane states are projected out and which can lead to chiral quantum eld
theories on the brane.

 lambert, pwest@mth.kcl.ac.uk

in the past four years it has become apparent that d-branes are of central
importance in our understanding of string theory [1]. an important feature of
d-branes is that they give rise to non-abelian vector multiplets in a variety of
dimensions less than ten. this has led to a new era in the study of yang-mills
theories with many results. a key step in these studies is to determine the spectrum
of an intersecting brane conguration from the various d-branes within it. in this
paper we would like to provide a study of d-branes in a manifestly spacetime
supersymmetric form, using the green-schwarz formalism [2]. while there have
been detailed studies focusing on spacetime supersymmetry [3], to the best of our
knowledge, a basic treatment of open strings with dirichlet boundary conditions
using the green-schwarz formalism has not appeared. this provides a simple and
elegant description of the spectrum which we hope will be useful when studying
brane congurations and quantum eld theories, particularly when studying more
phenomenological applications. we also note that a d-brane can be dened as an
open string that preserves a given spacetime supersymmetry. it then follows that
its states only propagate in p + 1 dimensions planes where the string end points
must lie. we will also describe a mechanism whereby some states can be projected
out and which can lead to chiral fermions.

we now review the essential aspects of the green-schwarz formulation of the
superstring that we will require [2]. this consists of the elds x (, );  =
0, 1, . . . , d  1 and the grassmann odd elds i(, ) which is a spacetime spinor
with an internal index i = 1,2. the elds i also carry a spinor index that we sup-
press and which runs over the dimension of the cliord algebra. the dimension of
this algebra varies depending on the spacetime dimension d and the type of spinor
i.e. majorana or majorana-weyl. we use the mostly plus signature and dene the
majorana conjugate of a spinor by  = t c. here c is the charge conjugation
matrix dened through the relation ()t = cc 1 and satises ct = c
with  = +1 for d = 2, 4 mod8 or  = 1 for d = 0, 6 mod8. we will mainly be
interested in ten dimensions where the spinors are majorana-weyl and with either
the same chirality (iib) or opposite chirality (iia).

the string has the action

here the rst term is given by

s = s1 + s2 .

(1)

s1 = 

1

2 z ddgg


 ,

2

where

 = x   ijj ,


and the second term has the form

s2 =

1

 z dd {ix (11  22) + 11 22} .

the action is invariant under the spacetime supersymmetry transformations

x  = ijj ,
i = i ,

(2)

where i, i = 1, 2 is a constant spinor of the same chirality as i. it is also invariant
under the i-transformations

x  = ijj ,
i = 2ii .

the spinorial parameter i is subject to the projection conditions

1 = p 

1 2 = p 

+2 ,

where

p 

 =

1
2

(
 

gg

) .

the equations of motion for the action are easily found to be

p 
{ggx   2ip 

g1 = 0,

 g 11  2ip 

 

1
2

gg = 0 ,
p 
+g2 = 0 ,
+ g 22} = 0 .

(3)

(4)

in deriving the above equations of motion we did not discuss the boundary
terms that arise when we vary the action (1). due to locality we must adopt

3

boundary conditions such that the boundary terms vanish separately at each end
point. this leads to the equation

z d (cid:18)x 

s

(x )

+ i

s

(i)(cid:19) = 0 ,

(5)

at  = 0 and  = . choosing the gauge g = e we nd that the above
boundary term vanishes if

x ( + i(11  22)) + i1(11 + 22)

 i x (11  22) + 1 1 22  11 2 2
= 0 ,

(6)

at the boundaries  = 0 and  = .

analysing the rst term in (5) shows that ends of the string obey neumann (n)
or dirichlet (d) boundary conditions [4]. let us denote the directions that obey n
and d boundary conditions at  = 0 by n0 and d0 respectively and similarly at
the other end at  =  by n and d. the d-brane the string is attached to at
 = 0 then has its longitudinal directions in   n0. since x  vanishes in the
directions that have d boundary conditions, the boundary terms containing x 
will vanish if at  = 0 if

(1 1  2 2) + (11 + 22) = 0,   n0,

with a similar condition at the other end of the string at  = . below we will
focus on the conditions at  = 0, but those for  =  are essentially identical.

examining the i variations we nd that at  = 0

11 + 22 = 0,   d0,
11  22 = 0,   n0.

the dierence in sign corresponds to fact that x  and  x  are undetermined
in the d and n directions respectively. the higher order terms in ()3 must vanish
separately. we must place a condition on i of the form 2 = p01. since 1 and

4

2 are majorana spinors this implies that 2 = 1 p0 where p0 = c 1p t
i satises the same conditions as  equation (3.4) implies that

0 c. since

 + p0p0 = 0,   d0,
  p0p0 = 0,   n0,

(7)

1

0

0 c = (1)pp 1

without loss of generality we can choose n0 = {0, 1, 2, . . . , p} for one d-brane.
taking p0 = 01...p and using the properties p0 = c 1p t
and
p 1
2 p(p+1)p0, we nd that the boundary conditions (7) are satised.
0 = (1)
we must now return to the x  terms in (6). clearly these vanish for dirichlet
boundary conditions. for neumann boundary conditions we require that 2 =
p01 and 2 = p1 at the two end points  = 0 and  =  respectively.
however this follows from the observation that the equations of motion (4) for 1
and 2 are related by a reection   , (this is easily seen in the conformal
gauge g = e). it is now possible to see that all terms in (6) vanish, including
the terms cubic in .

in iia theory string theory, we choose 1 and 2 to have opposite chiralities.
since p011 = (1)(p+1)(dp1)11p0 we nd that the condition 1 = p02 requires
d-branes to have even p. in type iib string theory on the other hand, 1 and 2
have the same chirality and we therefore nd d-branes have odd p. to summarise,
if we have an open string which goes from one d-brane to another or from one
d-brane to itself the i are subject to the constraints

2 = p01, 2 = p1,

at  = 0 and  =  respectively.
in general if the d-brane lies in some other
directions then p0 is given by the product of all the -matrices in the longitudinal
directions of the d-brane. the matrix p is formed in the same way.

next we must consider the eect of the boundary conditions (7), which will
break some of the supersymmetries. clearly the only supersymmetry variations
i that preserve the boundary conditions on i are those for which

2 = p01 ,

1 = p 1

0 p1 .

(8)

now consider the x  boundary conditions at  = 0. one nds

x  |=0 = i1h + p0p0i 1 |=0 ,
x  |=0 = i1h  p0p0i 1 |=0 .

5

demanding that x  = 0 for   d0 and x  = 0 for   n0 leads to (7).
analogous conditions arise for  = . hence we learn that the boundary conditions
are compatible with supersymmetry

in fact we see that the boundary conditions for the scalars are determined
by the supersymmetry projectors (8). for example one can readily see that if
p0 = 012...p then to preserve supersymmetry we must impose neumann boundary
conditions on x  for  = 0, ..., p and dirichlet boundary conditions for  = p +
1, ..., 9. thus by requiring a that a particular spacetime supersymmetry (8) is
preserved we learn that the  = 0 end point of the string is xed to lie on a surface
parallel to the (x0, x1, x2, ..., xp) plane. similarly one can determine on which plane
the  =  end point of the open string must end from a knowledge of p. therefore
we could dene a d-brane as an open string in type ii string theory that preserves
the spacetime supersymmetries (8). it then follows as a corollary that a dp-brane
with sixteen supersymmetries (i.e. with p0 = p) is p-dimensional spacelike plane
on which open strings can end [4].

there is another form of boundary condition that we want to consider here.
namely if we suspend a d-brane conguration between two ns-fivebranes. this
was rst considered in [5] where d-threebranes were placed between ns-vebranes.
this has the eect of dimensionally reducing the worldvolume of the intersection.
in addition boundary conditions must be imposed where the d-branes meet the
ns-vebranes and these can remove massless modes [5].

to be concrete consider two ns-vebranes parallel to the (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)
plane which have been introduced into a brane conguration, resulting in a par-
ticular direction, say x6, being reduced to an interval. the presence of the ns-
vebranes breaks half of the remaining supersymmetries, namely those for which

1 = 012345  pn s1 .

(9)

we want to nd out which string states are compatible with the remaining super-
symmetries. now the end points of the string are constrained to lie on an interval
for all time. since their motion is determined from the green-schwarz action it
follows that they can not carry any momentum along x6. therefore the string end
points must be xed at a denite value of x6. preserving supersymmetry requires
that

x 6 |=0= 1[6 + p06p0]1 = 0 ,

(10)

at  = 0. there is an analogous condition at  =  but since p01 = p1 and
p01 = p1 this yields an identical constraint. one can see that (10) vanishes

6

automatically if x 6 has dd, dn or nd boundary conditions. however, if the
boundary conditions for x 6 are nn then we nd that to preserve the spacetime
supersymmetry we must have

161|=0, = 0 ,
0 p1 = 1. next we write 1 = 1

(11)

for all 1 such that pn s1 = p 1
0 p)(1 +
pn s) for an arbitrary  and substitute this for 1 in (11). since (11) is now
true for all  we nd that the boundary conditions introduced by this dimensional
reduction must project out spinors

4(1 + p 1

(1 + p 1

 p0)(1  pn s)1|=0, = 0 .

if we further assume, as we will in what follows, that p, p0 and pn s all commute
then this simply becomes,

(1  pn s)1|=0, = 0 ,

(12)

where we have used the fact that p 1
 p01 = 1 at  = 0, . there are other
ways to compactify a brane conguration which reduce the massless spectrum.
for example one could place the conguration between two d-vebranes [5] or
compactify x6 on the orbifold s1/z2. the analysis of these situations follows in
an analogous manner.

our nal step in analysing the physical spectrum of states is to go to the light
cone gauge. in this case the equations of motion simplify considerably. since the
theory is invariant under worldsheet reparameterisations we choose the conformal
gauge g = e. we may also use the residual conformal symmetry to choose

x +  x 0 + x 1 = x+ + 2p+,

where the normalisation of p+ is appropriate for an open string. using the -
symmetry of equation (3) we may make one further gauge choice 01i = i and
reduce our spinor to

si =

1
2

(1 + 01)i .

note that the light cone projector involves a choice of direction (here we assume
it is x1) and sign (here we assumed a plus sign). however these can not be chosen

7

arbitrarily since 01 must commute with the other projectors p 1p and pn s. in
addition, in some two-dimensional cases these projectors may imply 01i = i.
this means that the i are chiral fermions on the worldsheet. however we must
chose the light cone projector to act non-trivially, otherwise the unphysical eld
components will not be projected out. thus in these cases we must chose the light
cone condition 01i = i. we will assume these conditions are satised in what
follows.

with these choices, the rst of the equations (4) can be used to solve for x 
and p . the equations of motion for the remaining variables take on the very
simple form

(2
 )x  = 0 ,
  2
( +  )1 = 0 ,
(   )2 = 0 ,

(13)

where here, and for the rest of this paper,  6= 0, 1. let us rst solve for the
scalars elds x . there are four possible combinations of boundary conditions for
an open string: nn, dd, nd and dn whose expansions are

in the quantum theory x  and s1 are promoted to operators which obey
the standard commutation and anti-commutations relations respectively. we in-
troduce a vacuum state |0 > which is annihilated by all the modes in x  and
s1 with positive frequency; n, r > 0. due to normal ordering ambiguities the
zero point energy (i.e. the rest mass squared of |0 >) is given by the intercept
a = (n(n)  n(s1
r ))/48, where, for example, n(n)
counts the number of bosonic integer moded oscillators [6]. the action of a non-
negatively moded oscillator on the ground state then raises the mass level by n or
r. thus the ground state is degenerate as s1
0 both map |0 > to itself. in
fact the action of 
0 simply generates spacetime momentum so we will ignore it
here.

let us suppose that we have n s1a

oscillators a = 1, ..., n (and we assume
that n is even). on behalf of the anti-commutation relation {s1a
0 } = ab,
the s1a
form a cliord algebra in n-dimensions acting on the ground state. there
is a unique non-trivial representation of this algebra which can be constructed as
follows. we start by dening n/2 helicity raising and n/2 helicity lowering op-
erators in the usual manor. then, from the lowest helicity component |0 : l >
of |0 > (which is annihilated by all the lowering operators), we obtain 2n/2 in-
dependent states by acting with the n/2 distinct raising operators. these create
equal numbers of bosonic and fermionic states which ll out a supersymmetric
multiplet. note that a spacetime supersymmetry algebra with 2n charges splits
into n null supersymmetries with {q, q} = 0 and n physical supersymme-
tries with {q, q} = 1. the null supersymmetries act trivially on the spectrum
and obey 01q = q if we choose spacelike momentum in the x1 direction. the
physical supersymmetries are the ones used above to create the non-trivial rep-
resentation of a cliord algebra in n dimensions. in general the states obtained

9

by this method are not cpt self-conjugate and so, according to the cpt theo-
rem, we must also include their cpt conjugates to obtain a physically acceptable
representation. however, for the special maximal case of sixteen supersymmetries,
the vector multiplet is cpt self-conjugate.

we must also decide what we mean by the constraint (12) in the quantum
theory. if we assume that (12) acts directly on the elds s1 then we run into severe
problems. for in this case imposing (12) reduces the number of independent spinors
s1 and therefore changes the intercept. the resulting spectrum would then have
dierent masses (quite possibly tachyonic) and could not be viewed as a subset of
the original multiplet. thus we must interpret (12) as applying to the action of s1
on the ground state |0 >. in particular we nd for the zero modes that

(1  pn s)s1

0|0 >= 0 .

(16)

in summary the spinors s2

n and s2

r have been eliminated in terms of s1

n and s1
r
which are subject to (15). if we include ns-vebranes then the spectrum of massless
states is also subjected to the constraint (16). note that, since (p 1
0 p)2 = 1
and tr(p 1
0 p is a multiple of the identity, there are only
three relevant cases for p 1
0 p: (1) all eight eigenvalues equal one, (2) all eight
eigenvalues equal minus one, (3) four eigenvalues are plus one and four eigenvalues
are minus one. let us consider in detail these three cases.

0 p) = 0 unless p 1

r = s2

r = 0 and s1

first we consider case (1), corresponding to parallel dp-branes with p0 = p.
we see immediately that s1
n is unconstrained. this leaves us with
eight independent integer moded spinors and sixteen spacetime supersymmetries.
the elds x  have either dd or nn boundary conditions and hence there are also
eight independent integer moded scalars. this leads to a cliord algebra in eight
dimensions represented by a sixteen-dimensional massless ground state. finally, if
there are n dp-branes, then we assign labels to the string end points to indicate
which dp-brane they lie on. the states of the quantised string then come in an
adjoint representation of u(n) and, since it is a sixteen-dimensional, it follows that
the ground state is a maximal super-yang-mills vector multiplet in p+1 dimensions
[7].

if we suspend these d-branes between two ns-vebranes then we must include
the projection (16). this removes half of the sixteen spacetime supersymmetries
and leaves only four independent s1a
acting on the ground state. applying the
remaining raising operators to |0 : l > produces a vector multiplet with eight

0

10

supersymmetries. in fact since there are now only four integer moded spinors, and
two helicity raising operators, we only obtain states with helicities 1,1/2, 0.
however the cpt theorem asserts that we must add in the positive helicity states
to obtain a complete vector multiplet with eight supersymmetries. this is the
situation in [5] for d-threebranes suspended between two ns-vebranes.

next we consider case (2), corresponding to an open string with one end on a
dp-brane and the other on an anti-dp-brane. here p0 = p and no spacetime
supersymmetries are preserved. the corresponding x  elds are the same as the
p0 = p case above. therefore there are eight integer moded scalars but now
there are eight half-integer moded fermions. the ground state is a cliord algebra
in zero dimensions and is one-dimensional. however the intercept is 1/2 so the
ground state is a tachyon [8].

finally we consider case (3). first we consider a degenerate situation where
p 1
0 p = 23456789. here p 1
n and eight
r . this corresponds to eight x  with dn or nd boundary conditions (i.e. an
s1
open string stretched between a dp-brane and a d(p + 8)-brane). thus the gound
state is massless, forms a one-dimensional cliord algebra in zero dimensions and
is a singlet under spacetime supersymmetry [9].

0 ps1 = s1 and hence there are no s1

in the general situation of case (3) there are four integer moded fermions s1
n
r . in addition there are four x  with either
and four half-integer moded fermions s1
dd or nn boundary conditions and four x  with nd or dn boundary conditions
(i.e an open string streched between a dp-brane and a d(p + 4)-brane). thus
the ground state forms a four-dimensional representation of cliord algebra in
four dimensions. if there are n1 d-branes corresponding to p0 and n2 d-branes
corresponding to p then, after labelling each end point, the states of this string
appear in the bi-fundamental representation of u(n1)u(n2). since the states are
not in the adjoint representation, they must form a hyper multiplet, dimensionally
reduced to the intersection of the d-branes [10]. the four states that we obtain
from quantising this string are not cpt invariant. to cure this we note that these
open strings are unorientated and so we must also include strings with p and p0
applied at the end points  = 0 and  =  respectively. this adds another copy
of the above states, resulting in a cpt invariant mutliplet.

let us suspend this d-brane conguration between two ns-vebranes. we
must then include the eect of (16) on the zero-modes. in general this leaves two
non-vanishing zero modes on |0 : l > giving a wess-zumino multiplet. after includ-
ing the cpt conjugate states we therefore obtain two bosons and two fermions. an

11

example of such a conguration is to chose p0 = 0123456, p = 0123678 and rather
than adding ns-vebranes we compactify x6 on a the orbifold s1/z2 = [0, 1]. this
corresponds to two d-sixbranes intersecting over a four-brane preserving n = 1
supersymmetry in four dimensions

d6 : 1
d6 : 1

where x6  [0, 1]. after compactication the surviving supersymmetries satisfy
6 = . in terms of the chiral components this gives 1 = 62 = 0123451. this
is the same projector as (9) and therefore we nd the same constraint (16) on s1
0 .
the ground state forms a chiral four-dimensional n = 1 wess-zumino multiplet
in the bi-fundamental of the two d-sixbrane gauge groups.
finally, an interesting degenerate case occurs if p 1

0 then,
since pn ss1
0|0 : l >= 0. thus there is no
spacetime supersymmetry in such a string and the only surviving massless modes
are the lowest helicity components of the ground state. since the ground state is a
hyper multiplet this gives two helicity  1
2 fermions. to be specic one could take
p0 = 01236, p = 01346 and pn s = 012345 which can be pictured as

0 = pn ss1

i.e. two d-fourbranes intersecting over a twobrane and suspended between two
ns-vebranes. after performing the dimensional reduction induced by the ns-
vebranes one nds two chiral fermions in the resulting two-dimensional theory.

clearly there are other possibilities which we have not analysed here. for exam-
ple one could add more ns-vebranes, as in brane box constructions, dimensionally
reducing additional directions of a brane conguration.
