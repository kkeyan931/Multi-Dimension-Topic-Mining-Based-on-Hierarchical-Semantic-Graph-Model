abstract

we dene supersymmetric spin networks, which provide a complete set of gauge invariant states for
supergravity and supersymmetric gauge theories. the particular case of osp(1/2) is studied in detail and
applied to the non-perturbative quantization of supergravity. the supersymmetric extension of the area
operator is dened and partly diagonalized. the spectrum is discrete as in quantum general relativity,
and the two cases could be distinguished by measurements of quantum geometry.

introduction

in this paper we describe an extension of the spin network states to supergravity. the spin network states play
a fundamental role in non-perturbative quantizations of both gauge theories [1] and gravitational theories
[2, 3, 4]. in the gauge theory context they provide an orthonormal basis for lattice gauge theories [1]. in this
case the spin networks are labeled graphs on the lattice, whose edges are labeled by the nite irreducible
representations of the gauge group g. in quantum gravity dieomorphism invariance reduces the degrees
of freedom, so that a basis of states invariant under spatial dieomorphisms and local frame rotations are
given by the dieomorphism classes of spin networks [3, 4]. in this case the group is su (2), for the chiral
formulation based on the ashtekar-sen variables [5, 6], or su (2) + su (2) in the relativistic case[7, 8].

over the last ten years there has been a great deal of progress in our understanding of the non-perturbative
structure of quantum general relativity, leading to the complete formulation of the quantum theory1. among
the key results are the discovery that dieomorphism invariant observables that measure aspects of the
spatial geometry such as areas of surfaces and volumes of regions are nite, and have discrete, computatable
spectra[2, 3, 4, 11]. this has led to a physical understanding of the spin network states as eigenstates of
these geometrical observables.

during this period there have been a number of papers which extend the methods used to supergravity[12,
13, 14, 15, 16]. these have included the formulation of n = 1, 2[13, 14, 15], and n = 4[16] supergravity
in terms of chiral, ashtekar-sen like variables, as well as the discovery of exact solutions to the quantum
constraints[13, 15]. however, much more remains to be done in this direction. the non-perturbative quanti-
zation of gravitational theories with extended supersymmetry is largely unexplored territory, despite the fact
that extended supersymmetry is essential to the success of string theory, which remains the only successful
technique for investigating quantum gravity in the perturbative regime. another important open area of
investigation is the properties of bp s states in the non-perturbative regime. this could be very interesting

as it could provide a way to compare results on black hole entropy gotten by both string theory[19] and loop
quantum gravity[20].

in this paper we take a rst step to the study of the non-perturbative quantization of supersymmetric
theories of gravitation by constructing the spin network states for n = 1 supergravity. we nd a number
of new features, which suggest that this could be a fruitful direction of investigation. the main result is
a diagrammatic method for the construction and evaluation of spin networks for the supergroup osp(1/2).
as a rst example we construct and partly diagonalize the supersymmetric extension of the area operator.
as expected the spectrum is discrete, but dierent from that of quantum general relativity. this means
that experimental probes of geometry at the planck scale could in principle distinguish dierent hypotheses
about the local gauge symmetry. this is highly interesting in light of recent developments that suggest that
astrophysical probes of planck scale physics can be developed[21].

another possible application of the formalism given here is to supersymmetric yang-mills theory. it will
be very interesting to investigate the extent to which the physics of n = 2 and n = 4 super-yang-mills
theory can be expressed in terms of the spin network states.

it is straightforward to extend the construction here to n = 2 and higher supersymmetry, this will be
described elsewhere [22, 23]. also, in progress [24] is an examination of the canonical and boundary structure
of n = 1, 2 quantum supergravity, which extends results on a holographic formulation of quantum general
relativity with nite cosmological constant [25, 8].

in the next section we review some of the basic results about n = 1 supergravity in chiral coordinates, rst
studied by jacobson[12]. in section 3 we present some results from the representation theory of osp(1/2)
which allow us in section 4 to construct quantum spin networks. the diagrammatic method for doing
calculations with these states is introduced in section 5, and the following sections describe examples and
calculations.

finally, we mention that we do not here provide rigorous proofs for the assertions made, but we see no
reason why a straightforward extension of the rigorous methods introduced in [26, 27, 28, 29] to the present
case should not be possible.

2 review of quantum supergravity

supergravity in terms of the new variables maybe was initially investigated in [12] and extended in [13, 14].
in this paper we will consider mainly n = 1 supergravity. as shown rst by jacobson in [12], this can
be formulated in chiral variables which extend the ashtekar-sen variables of general relativity.
in this
formulation, the canonical variables are the left handed su(2) spin connection ai
a and its superpartner spin-
3/2 eld a
a . as shown in [15] these t together into a connection eld of the superlie algebra osp(1/2)
(which is referred to in some references [13, 15, 30] as gsu (2).)

we thus dene the graded connection:

aa := ai

aji + a

a qa

(1)

i and a

a are momenta of ai

a and a

a respectively, we can dene the graded

where a is the spatial index. if fea

momentum as:

the constraints that generate local gauge transformations can then be expressed as usual as,

the left and right handed supersymmetry transformations are generated by[12],

where the cosmological constant is given by  = g2. the dieomorphism and hamiltonian constraints can
be derived by taking the poisson brackets of (4) and (5).
these may be written simply in terms of the fundamental representation of osp(1/2), which is 3 dimen-
sional. the superlie algebra osp(1/2) is then generated by ve 3 3 matrices gi (i = 1...5), given explicitly
in [15]. using them we can dene

where i = (i, a) labels the ve generators of osp(1/2).

then the rst two constraints can be combined into one osp(1/2) gauss constraint:

dae a

i = 

while the last one combines with the hamiltonian constraint to give:

where fab is the curvature of the super connection aa :

e ae bfab  igabce ae be c = 

fab := daab + [aa,ab]

a key feature of this kind of approach to supergravity is that the supersymmetry gauge invariance has
been split into two parts, which play rather dierent roles. the left handed supersymmetry transformations
generated by eq. (4) combine with the su (2) gausss law (3) to give a local osp(1/2)l gauge invariance.
the theory is then written so that the associated osp(1/2) connection is the canonical coordinate. the right
handed part of the supersymmetry, generated by (5), is a dynamical constraint, being quadratic rather than
linear in the momentum. it joins with the hamiltonian constraint to form a left handed supersymmetry
multiplet of dynamical operators.

it is then natural in a chiral formulation of supergravity to represent the left-handed supersymmetry
kinematically, and solve it completely by expressing the theory completely in terms of osp(1/2) invariant
states. these are the spin network states we will present shortly. the remaining, right handed, part of
the supersymmetry is then imposed as a dynamical operator, and has the same status as the hamiltonian
constraint.

the loop representation for supergravity in the chiral representation was constructed in [15] in terms of
osp(1/2) wilson loops. these are dened in terms of the supertrace taken in the fundamental 3 dimensional
representation of osp(1/2).

t [] = strpexp(i

dsaaa)  stru(a)

(11)

the wilson loops:

these wilson loop states are subject to additional relations arising from intersections of loops. these
are solved completely by the introduction of the spin network basis, which are complete and orthogonal[4].
we can construct the loop-momentum variables by inserting the osp(1/2) invariant momentum e a into
(12)
it is straightforward to show that the t [] and t a[](s) form a closed algebra under poisson brackets, which
we will call the n = 1 super-loop algebra.
we will also need to describe operators quadratic in the conjugate momenta, which in the loop represen-

t a[](s) = str[u(a)e a((s)]

tation are formed by inserting two momenta in the loop trace,

the higher order loop operators are similarly dened as

t ab[](s, t) = str[u(s, t)e a((t))u(t, s)e b((s))]

t ab...c[](s, t, ...v) = str[u(s, t)e a((t))u(t, u)e b((u))...u(v, s)e c((s))]

(13)

(14)

as discussed in [15], the supersymmetric extension of the chern-simons state may be formed from the

chern-simons form of the superconnection aa,
i

scs(aa) = exp[

z dxst r(a  f 


a  a  a)]

(15)

this state is an exact solution to all the quantum constraints. like the ordinary chern-simons state it also
has a semiclassical interpretation as the ground state associated with desitter or anti-desitter spacetime.

3 finite dimensional irreducible representation of osp(1/2).

spin networks may be constructed for any lie or superlie algebra, a by extending the original denition
[17, 18]. an a-spin network is a labeled graph whose edges are labeled by the nite dimensional irreducible
representations of a and whose nodes are labeled by the associated intertwiners. in quantum gravity spin
networks states are associated with the gauge group of the connection, which we have seen in the case of
n = 1 supergravity in the chiral representation [12] to be osp(1/2). the representation theory of osp(1/2)
has been studied in detail in [30, 31, 32, 34], here we give some of the basic facts that we will need to
construct the associated spin network states.

the superlie algebra of osp(1/2), is constructed by three bosonic generators ji (i=1,2,3)and two fermionic

generators qa(a = 0, 1). the commutation relations are :

[ji, jj] = iijkjk
[ji, qa] = 1/2(i)b
aqb
{qa, qb} = 1/2ab iji

(16)

(17)

(18)

where  i are pauli matrices.

each irreducible representation of the osp(1/2) contains two adjacent su (2) representations. one is
labeled by spin j and the other by j  1/2. j may be taken as the label of the osp(1/2) representation,
and is related to the eigenvalues of the quadratic casmier operator of the supergroup osp(1/2):

c = j iji + abqaqb

(19)

by

c|j >= j(j + 1/2)|j >

(20)
for each j the representation is a graded vector space with a basis labeled by |j; l; m >, where j is an
integer or half-integer, and l can be j or j  1/2 and l  m  l. the dimension of the space of the
representation with spin j is 4j + 1.
the usual rules for combination of angular momentum can be extended directly to these states. the result
is a super racah-wigner calculus which gives the results of decompositions of products of representations of
osp(1/2). the tensor product is completely reducible and is given by

j1nj2 = |j1  j2|l|j1  j2 + 1/2|l...|j1 + j2|

(21)

note that this diers from the familiar su (2) case in that representations which dier from j1 + j2 by
both integers and half integers are included. the clebsh-gordon coecients for the expansion of the basis
elements are determined uniquely, from their values for su (2).

next we consider the reduction of the tensor product of three irreducible representations (j1, j2, j3). as
in the su (2) case we have two dierent recoupling schemes. one can couple the representations (j1, j2) into
j12 rst and then couple the result to j3 to give the nal representation; or one couples (j2, j3) into j23 rst
and then couples to j1 next. these two representations are related to each other by the racah sum rule
in terms of super rotation 6-symbols. for osp(1/2), the parity independent super-rotation 6-symbols are
dened as[21]:

then the racah sum rule reads:

where be and  are the sign factors related to the super-spins involved. the interesting fact is that except
these two sign factors, the structure of two relations are the same as the structure for su(2) rotation algebra.
therefore when we restrict the sum of three super-spins in all the triangles (j1, j2, j12), (j1, j3, j13), (j2, j3, j23)
to be integers, then all the expressions go back to the normal racah sum rule and the biedenharn-elliott
identity for su (2).

4 spin network states of n = 1 supergravity

we recall that a spin network state of quantum general relativity, denoted | > consists of an embedding of
closed graph  into a xed three manifold  with edges labeled by the representation of su(2)(su (2)q) and
vertices labeled by intertwining operators, namely distinct ways to decompose the incoming representations
into a singlet. here we dene the super spin networks in the same way only by replacing the su (2) with
superlie algebra osp(1/2).2 the elements of the super spin networks are links and vertices. notice that in
quantum general relativity, the link of color n corresponds to a parallel propogator of connection aa along
this path in the spin n/2 representation of su(2), here associated to very link we also label a color ni which
is two times as the superspin ji which labels the representation of osp(1/2). for every vertex ve, there are
incoming links with color nin
ei . so we can label the vertex by the total

color ve =pi nin
corresponding to every super spin network (sg, ni, ve), there is a super spin network state < sg, ni, ve|
in the hilbert space of the supergravity. as an independent basis, the super spin network can also be
expressed as the bras so that a general state in this representation is given by:

ei which satises 1/2  ve  k/2.

ei and outcoming links with color nout

ei pi nout

[sg] :=< sg| >
we now list some basic facts about the super spin networks .

 as in the su (2) case there is no intertwiner associated to trivalent nodes because given

|j1  j2|  j3  |j1 + j2|

(25)

(26)

then the map from the tensor products of two representations to the reduced representation is unique.

 the condition that the sum of three colors of the links adjacent to a trivalent vertex must sum to an
even number does not hold, because both even and odd spins appear in the sum (21). as the color of
the link is twice the spin, the edges of a trivalent vertex can be any integers such that eq. (26) holds.

2it is also possible to extend the construction to the quantum graded group, osp(1/2)q. we do not carry this out here.

 if the valences adjacent to the same vortex is more than three, intertwiners are needed to label the
dierent maps from the incoming representations to the singlet state. as in the su (2) case the multi-
valent vertices can be decomposed in terms of trivalent vertex connected by internal edges, as described
in [4].

note that this means that there is no simple way to decompose the osp(1/2) spin networks completely
in terms of ordinary spin networks because there is no ordinary spin network vertex corresponding to the
superspin network vertices where the sum of incident colors is odd. however, there is still a very useful
decomposition, which we will give below.

as in the su (2) case, there is a recoupling theory based on the racah sum rule and biedenharn-elliott

identity in terms of the super-rotation 6-j symbols. we can express the recoupling theory by g.1:

where the sum is over labels such that the super 6-j symbols satises the triangle inequalities eq. (26).

5 graphic representation of the super spin networks

we can now give a diagrammatic notation for osp(1/2) spin networks which is useful for computation.
we follow the method developed in [4] and elaborated in [11] for quantum general relativity in which a
diagrammatic notion for su (2) spin network states was developed by modifying notations used by penrose[17]
and kauman and linns[35]. the result is a diagrammatic notation of super spin networks based on the
connection between them and the representation theory of the supergroup osp(1/2).

5.1 element of the diagrams

the basic fact about the su (2) representation theory on which the penrose and kauman and linns notation
rests is that all irreducible representations can be obtained by symmetrizing products of the fundamental
representation. in the case of osp(1/2) all irreducible representations can be obtained via a process of graded
symmetrizing, in which there are extra signs for even and odd parts of the representations. there are in fact
two dierent fundamental representations for the osp(1/2), which are complex conjugates of each other. let
us consider rst the left handed fundamental representation. it is a three dimensional graded vector space,
whose elements may be written

 = (

a


)

(27)

where a = (0, 1) denotes the left handed su (2) spinor index part and  =  denotes the third component.
here we take the a = a to be fermionic while the  =  is bosonic. the grade of the index, g(), is
dened to be one for  and zero for a. under the action of osp(1/2),  transforms as:

 = u

(cid:229)
 is an element in the fundamental representation of osp(1/2).

where 3  3 matrix u 
the higher irreducible representations are formed by taking graded symmetric products of this funda-
mental representation. for instance the basis states for j=1 span a ve dimensional space, which can be
constructed by symmetrized tensor products of two states in the fundamental representation, as,

() :=

1
2

[ + (1)g()g()]

(29)

we can then read o the components of the basis states of the j = 1 representation. they consist of a

pair of su (2) representations, given by,

the rst term is the bosonic component dened as,

() = ((ab), (a))

and the second term is the fermionic component of the basis states.

the other term [] vanishes due to the antisymmetrization.

under the action of osp(1/2), the states transform as:

this allows us to generalize the penrose diagrammatic notation for su (2) spin networks. we indicate the
elements of a super spin networks by bold lines, the elements with su(2) indices by thin lines and third
component  =  by dotted lines. then we can denote the 

 and its components as g.2.

then its straightforward to express (35) as g.3.
let us consider the component formulation of this expression. when the indices of delta are su (2) spinor
indices, its easy to see that it goes back to the normal spin networks expression. if one index is fermionic
and the other one is bosonic, they commute with other and we can denote the expression by two vertical
lines, one solid and one dotted. if both indices are bosonic, which may be denoted by two vertical dotted
lines. however this term vanishes because the graded symmetrization antisymmetrizes them and there is a
single bosonic component. the procedure of the decomposition of the super element can then be drawn as
g.4.

thus, we have a way to decompose the diagrams for osp(1/2) spin networks into combinations of su (2)
spin network diagrams and dotted lines representing the single bosonic component of the fundamental repre-
sentation. it is straightforward to see how this works when applied to any higher dimensional representation
of osp(1/2), which is gotten by making a graded symmetrization of n fundamental representations. the
basic property is that all the terms whose corresponding graphs have two or more dotted lines must vanish

also since we need to antisymmetrize them. as a result, the basis states in any dimensional representation
consists of two components,

where

(1...n) = ((a1...an), (a1...an10)),

(a1...an) = (a1 a2...an)

(a1...an10) = (a1a2 ...an10).

the unit element of the supergroup in this representation can be expressed as:

( ... )

(...) := (

 

... )



(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

and the corresponding graph can be drawn as g.5. thus we see that we can decompose a super spin
network into a sum of diagrams, each of which is a normal spin network together with dotted lines. in this
decomposition each edge of the superspin network, with color n becomes two ordinary spin network edges,
the rst an n line without a dotted line and the second with an n  1 line with a single dotted line. this is
shown in g.5.

5.2 trivalent vertices

next we consider the tri-valent vertex. as there is no restriction that the incident colors must add up to an
even number, as in the su (2) case, the simplest trivalent node is the one in which all three edges have color
one. this node can be visualized in two ways, depending on how the direction of time is read. one fermion
with spin one half meets one boson with spin zero and then changes into one fermion, or two fermions with

figure 5: decomposition of the super link of color n

spin one half meet together forming into a boson which is also singlet state. these processes are expressed
by g.6.

we next consider the case in which every link has color two. this can be decomposed into the ordinary

su (2) spin networks as shown in g.7.

in general, if the sum of the three colors is even it can be decomposed into four terms, each of which

contains an ordinary spin network plus, possible dotted edges. we illustrate it in g.8.

5.3 simple closed diagrams: the super- graph

we have found that edges and nodes of superspin networks decompose into sums of terms, each of which
consists of an ordinary spin network, perhaps dressed by dotted lines. as a result any closed super spin
network can be decomposed into a sum of such terms. as an example, we describe the simplest example of
a closed spin network, which is the  graph. the simplest one is the diagram in which every link has color
one. this super  graph can be decomposed into a sum of three components, each of which is an ordinary
spin network. this is illustrated in g.9.

another interesting  diagram is the one in which the colors of three links are (n, 2, n). we will use
it later in the calculation of the area spectrum in quantum supergravity. it can be decomposed into four
components in terms of su (2) spin networks as shown in g.10.

6 evaluation of super spin networks

in the case of su (2) spin networks, the edges represent projection operators, which live in the temperly
lieb algebra. these can always be decomposed using the bracket identity [see g.11].

figure 7: decomposition of trivalent vertex in which every link has color two.

as a result, associated with any ordinary spin network there is a number which is called its evaluation.
this was rst introduced by penrose[17]. it is now known to be a special case of the kauman bracket
polynomial when the quantum deformation parameter a = 1.
for the supergroup osp(1/2), the spinor identity does not exist any more. therefore there is no bracket
identity (although in the super loop representation some identities analogous to the mandelstam identity
can be expressed by means of the supertraces of the holonomies [15]). but we can still evaluate a super spin
networks by rst decomposing it into ordinary su (2) spin networks, using the rules dened in the previous
section, and then evaluating each component.

the evaluation of a super spin network in fact corresponds to taking the supertrace of a product of
projection operators on the direct product of a number of fundamental representations. the fact that it
can be expressed in terms of the evaluations of ordinary spin network is a consequence of the fact that
the supertrace can be decomposed into a sum of traces over the su (2) representations that make up a
representation of osp(1/2). in fact, the sign factors necessary to turn a sum of traces into a supertrace are
already built into our formalism by the sign factors that go into the graded symmetrizations that dene the
edges and nodes of the super spin networks. in the example of the super  graph, as well as in the examples
that follow, one can see how this works explicitly.

as a direct application, we can calculate the super standard closure of the super tangles, which is dened

as the supertrace of the holonomy of the at connection in this representation:

here when we take the trace of the dotted line, we nd its value is one.
let us consider the simple super  graph in which the colors of links are (1, 2, 1). after decomposing
the graph into the normal spin networks and taking the trace of them as shown in g.12, we nd the value
of the  graph is one. also since this graph is equivalent to the super standard closure with color two (see
the rst step in gure 12), we can nd the value of this graph by (40) directly, in which n equals two. if we
consider another example in which the colors are (2,2,2), we have the answer illustrated in g.13.

in the third step the coecient one fourth appears when we try to separate the dotted loop from the
real-line loops. since initially the bosonic index is symmetrized with the fermionic indices, we have four
dierent ways to connect the ropes to form loops. but the value of any loop which is formed by connecting
one real rope and one dotted rope must be zero, therefore only one graph has non-zero value. we illustrate
the specic expansion in g.14. the most interesting  graph, which has important application to the
calculation of the area spectrum in supergravity, is the one with colors (n,2,n). from the last section, we
see this graph can be divided into four graphs with respect to the ordinary su(2) spin networks. in g.16
the bosonic index is symmetrized with the fermionic indices. to evaluate all these graphs, we also need to
separate the dotted loop from each  graph. in other words, we must decouple the dotted line from the
symmetrizer just as we have done for the  graph (1,2,1)and (2,2,2).

when doing this one must be careful to obtain the right coecients for each term. the key point is
that the dotted line has to be connected to the dotted line and for every vertex the triangle inequality must
hold. in general when the dotted line is separated from the symmetrizer of color n, the factor 1/n appears

and there are n terms due to the dierent permutation of the dotted line as shown in g.15. for the second
and third term in gure 16, there is only one possible routing of the dotted line which has non-zero value
among the 2n possibilities, therefore the coecients are 1/2n. for the last term, the dotted line cant be
connected to the link of color two so there are (n 1)(n 1) routings with non-zero value and the coecient
is (n1)2/n2. now its straightforward to evaluate the super  graph by summing all the ordinary  graphs:

it is not dicult to generalize this calculation to the case in which the super  graph has color(m, 2, n).
one nds that the coecients before every ordinary  graphs respectively are (1, 1/2n, 1/2m, (n  1)(m 
1)/mn). however, it is more complicated to nd a general formula for the super  graph with color (m, n, p),
in which the separation of the dotted loop from links labeled by m, n obviously depends on the third link
with color p.

7 the super-area operator and its spectrum

a natural question concerning the spin network states of supergravity is whether we can construct observables
such as the area and the volume of the space in terms of their action on super spin network states, as in the

case of general relativity[4]. here we show that the answer is yes, if the operator is suitably dened. in this
section we construct the area operator and calculating its eigenvalues in the context of super spin network
basis.

the gauge invariance of supergravity includes the osp(1/2) symmetry, hence we must require the ob-
servables should be invariant under its full action. the expression for the area operator in quantum general
relativity, computed in [2, 3, 4], is not an observable in supergravity, since it is not osp(1/2) gauge invariant.
but it is not dicult to extend the denition of the area of a surface in general relativity to an expression
which is osp(1/2) invariant. given a spatial surface s, which is a two-dimensional manifold embedded in
the spacetime manifold m, we dene the supersymmetric area to be:
dsqnanbe aie b

a[s] =z

(42)

i

where na is the normal vector of the surface and the e ai is the conjugate momentum. the denition of
area operator is closely related to the two-hand loop operator t ab that we have introduced in section three.
when the loop shrinks to a point, following [11] and using the identity about the supertrace of the osp(1/2)
lie algebra we nd,

t ab[](s, t) = str[u(s, t)e a((t))u(t, s)e b((s))] = e aie b

state as a second order loop operator which can be expressed in terms of the elementary grasp operation;
or equivalently one can dene the action of the area operator on spin networks as inserting two trivalent
intersections on the link by a new link of color 2, then calculate the eigenvalues of the operator by recoupling
theory directly. here we can dene the action of super t variables in terms of the elementary grasp operation.
this allows us to calculate the spectrum of the operator in both ways.
let us consider the former method rst. the action of the super operator t a on the super spin networks
can be dened as g.(17). basically as we have done in the previous sections, we can decompose super spin

figure 17: action of t a with one grasp on the super spin networks

networks into the ordinary su(2) ones and then consider the action of the operator on them separately.
from g.4, we see the super link of color 2 can be divided into two components, so the corresponding action
of the super operator can be divided into two parts which can be illustrated in gure 18. for convenience,
lets dene these actions as real grasp and dotted grasp respectively.

when decomposed in terms of su (2) spin networks, we nd that there are several distinct grasp op-
erations. the rst possibility is the real grasp to the real line, which is exactly the normal grasps having
appeared in [11]. the second one is the dotted grasp acting on the real line, and the third one the dotted
grasp acting on the dotted line. note that the real grasp acting on the dotted line vanishes since the only
possible result is that two real lines combine together and go back.

now its straightforward to express the action of super operators on the link of color n, but we need
be careful to determine the multiplicative factors when using the leibnitz rule to dene the action of area

figure 18: the super grasps in the view of ordinary su(2) spin networks

operator on it. specially, there is a great dierence between the real grasp and the dotted grasp. since the
area operator is related to the second order super loop operator, we can take the t ab as the handle with two
grasps in the super spin network basis. when two grasps act on the link of color n, they can grasp the same
rope, or any two dierent ropes, so there are n2 possible ways to grasp the link. but when the real grasps
act on the dotted rope, the results of the action are zero. so the number of non-zero grasps are n2 and
(n  1)2 to the doublet of the super link respectively. also after the two dotted grasps act on the link of
color n, we need separate the dotted rope from the solid ropes so that we can apply the formula with respect
to the ordinary su (2) spin networks. as we have discussed in the last section, the separation involves the
factor 1/2n. as a result the coecients before the graphs acted by the dotted grasps are n/2. figure 19 and
20 show the actions of these two kinds of grasps on the link of color n.

finally we arrive at the last step of this section, that is to calculate the spectrum of the area operator.
combining the two actions of the grasps together, we nd the super spin network states are the eigenstates
of the a2. it is straightforward to compute the eigenvalues of t ab in the super spin network basis (see g.21)
and the result is:

here we have applied the identities and the formulas in su(2) spin networks. this conrms the expected
result that the spectrum is discrete and is directly related to the eigenvalues of the casmier operator of
osp(1/2).

next we conclude that we can get the same solution to eigenvalues of the area operator directly by
employing the identity associated with the representation of osp(1/2), in which the evaluation of the super
projectors eq.(40) and super  graphs (41) is involved. the procedure is shown in g.22.

finally, we note that we have computed here only a part of the spectrum of the superarea operator,
which is that concerned with the intersections of edges of the superspin network with the surface s. as in
the su (2) case there are additional eigenvalues associated with the possibility that the surface s intersects
nodes of the superspin network. these eigenvalues may not be physically relevant as the probability of such
intersections is zero, but in any case they can be computed directly.

8 conclusions

in this paper we have taken an important step in the extension of the results of loop quantum gravity to
supergravity and string theory. we have shown that for n = 1 supergravity in 3 + 1 dimensions there is
a straightforward extension of the methods developed in [3, 4, 11] from quantum general relativity. the
extension to n = 2 is in progress and will be reported shortly [22, 24]. there is in fact nothing to prevent
the direct extension to any n , what is dicult is only the question of whether, for n > 2, all the degrees
of freedom of higher n supergravities are represented by an extension of the connection representation, or
whether additional degrees of freedom need to be introduced.
in this connection we may note that the
extension of the loop representation to represent the states of p-form gauge elds is straightforward, and has
been worked out for p = 2 [36, 37] and p = 3 [38]. in the latter case an extension of the loop representation
that describes a limit of m theory in which only the 3-form eld of 11 dimensional supergravity survives
can be discussed, and a large set of exact non-perturbative states found [38].
finally, the quantum deformation of the supersymmetric spin network states may be developed along
the lines of [35], and applied both to yield the supersymmetric extension of the spin foam models[7, 39] as
well as to the background independent formulation of m theory described in [40, 41].
