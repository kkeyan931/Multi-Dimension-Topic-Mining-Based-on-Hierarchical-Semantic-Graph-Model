1. introduction

in this letter we study the conditions on curved string backgrounds of the form ads3
n that give rise to spacetime superconformal symmetry. we use the nsr formulation;
for simplicity we describe the left moving sector only  it can be combined with the right-
moving sector in the standard way. string theories on ads3  n were studied for the
bosonic case in [1,2,3]. examples of supersymmetric strings in the nsr formulation were

studied in, e.g., [1,4,5,6,3,7]. for some early work on string theory on ads3 see, e.g., [8].
the main results of this work are the following: if n has an ane u (1) symmetry and
n /u (1) has an n = 2 worldsheet superconformal symmetry, then there is a construction
of a superstring with two-dimensional n = 2 spacetime superconformal symmetry. a

z2 quotient of this construction leads to a family of theories with two-dimensional n = 1

spacetime superconformal symmetry. we also discuss conditions for n > 2 superconformal
symmetry: these involve an n with an su (2) factor whose level is determined in terms
of the level of the ads3 background.

this investigation is the analog of the study of supersymmetric backgrounds for com-
pactication to minkowski space md in d = 3 or 4 dimensions [9,10,11,12]. string theories
on m4  n have four-dimensional n = 1 spacetime supersymmetry provided n has an
n = 2 worldsheet superconformal symmetry [9,10]. string theories on m3  n have
three-dimensional n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry if n has an ane u (1) and n /u (1)
has an n = 2 worldsheet superconformal symmetry. a z2 quotient of such an n leaves
a three-dimensional n = 1 spacetime supersymmetry; in this case, the symmetry algebra
on n can be extended to a nonlinear algebra associated to manifolds with g2 holonomy
[11,12].

the structure of the paper is as follows: in section 2, we describe the worldsheet
properties that lead to spacetime supersymmetry on ads3 n . in section 3, we construct
the two dimensional n = 2 spacetime superconformal algebra associated with the boundary

cft of ads3. in section 4, we take a quotient of the n = 2 construction to nd a class of

models with n = 1 spacetime superconformal symmetry. in section 5, we discuss models

with n > 2 spacetime superconformal symmetry. finally, in section 6, we comment on

new examples that arise from our results and other issues.

2. worldsheet properties of fermionic strings on ads3  n

we rst consider the ads3 factor of the background. this theory has ane sl(2)

currents

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

the purely bosonic currents ja generate an ane sl(2) algebra at level k+2 and commute
with a, whereas the total currents j a generate a level k sl(2) algebra and act on  as

follows from (2.2),(2.3). the central charge of the ads3 part of the theory is thus

csl(2) =

3(k + 2)

(2.4)

where the two terms are the bosonic and fermionic contributions, respectively. the n = 1

worldsheet supercurrent is

(2.5)

the internal space n is described by a unitary superconformal eld theory (cft)

background with central charge

cn = 15  csl(2) =

.

(2.6)

we denote the worldsheet supercurrent of n by t n
f .

the construction of n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry described in section 3 below

requires that n have an ane u (1) symmetry with an n = 1 current

u(1) + j u(1) ,

where

(z  w)2 ,

j u(1)(z)u(1)(w)  0 ,

and a worldsheet supercurrent

t u(1)
f

= u(1)j u(1) .

it is convenient to bosonize the ane current

j u(1) = iy

where y is a canonically normalized scalar: y (z)y (w)   log(z  w).
we can construct the quotient cft n /u (1) with the supercurrent

t n /u(1)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

the construction of n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry described in section 3 below further
requires that n /u (1) have an n = 2 superconformal algebra (which commutes with the
u (1) above). in particular, its u (1)r-current j n /u(1)

has the standard normalization

3. n = 2 spacetime superconformal theories

we now construct an n = 2 superconformal algebra in spacetime out of the worldsheet

ingredients described above. as in [1], we introduce canonically normalized scalars hi with
i = 0, 1, 2:

h1 = 12

ih2 = 3u(1)
i3h0 = j n /u(1)

(we neglect the usual cocycle factors). the supercharges g
are brst invariant. this requires that the ope of tf (z)s

(see (2.10),(3.1),(3.3)). substituting all 4 solutions of 12 = 1 into (3.7), we recover (3.5).
in addition, e/2s
r as dened in

r are mutually local. this completes the proof that g

(3.4) are physical.

(3.12)

the algebra (3.10) is a global spacetime n = 2 superconformal algebra.

string theory on ads3  n has a f ull spacetime virasoro symmetry ln, with n  z
[1,3]; commuting ln with the generators of the global algebra (3.10) gives a full spacetime
n = 2 superconformal algebra in the spacetime ns-sector with modes g
2 and
jn, n  z. physical states are constructed using physical vertex operators that are local
with respect to the supercharges (3.4); this is the analog of the usual gso projection1.

r , r  z + 1

4. n = 1 spacetime superconformal theories

the construction of the previous section gave us two dimensional n = 2 spacetime

superconformal symmetry. it is straightforward to nd a z2 quotient that preserves exactly

half of the spin elds (3.5) and leads to n = 1 spacetime superconformal symmetry. this

quotient is analogous to the construction of manifolds with g2 holonomy by a z2 quotient
of a product of a calabi-yau manifold with an s1 [12].

concretely, we break the n = 2 superconformal symmetry of n /u (1) by the quo-
tient with respect to j n /u(1)
; simultaneously, we take the quotient with
respect to j u(1)  j u(1) and u(1)  u(1). this has the net eect of identifying
{h1, h2, h0}  {h1, h2, h0} (see (3.1)), and thus s
(3.5). therefore, the
spacetime superconformal symmetry is projected to the n = 1 subalgebra generated by

 j n /u(1)

r

the symmetric combination g+

r + g
r .

this indeed resembles the construction of superconformal models on manifolds with
g2 holonomy [11,12], except that the total central charge of n is not 21/2 but rather
21/2  6/k (see (2.6)). it would be interesting to see if one can nd a general nonlinear
worldsheet algebra that characterizes n and then use the methods of [11] to generate the
n = 1 spacetime superconformal symmetry in the general ads3  n case.

1 strictly speaking, the full virasoro algebra and physical states were constructed in the eu-

clidean version of ads3 [1,3]. the construction of the nite lie superalgebra (3.10) uses only the

algebraic structure of sl(2), and is independent of the representation theory; hence it is also valid

for the lorentzian case.

6

5. n > 2 spacetime superconformal theories

we may also consider the extension of the methods of section 3 to models with n > 2

symmetry. this gives rise to models that have been considered on a case by case basis in

the literature [1,4,5,6].

the small n = 4 superconformal algebra (see [1] and references therein) has an ane

su (2) r-symmetry. as explained in [1], this spacetime ane su (2) arises from a level k
worldsheet ane su (2) factor in n . for the construction of section 3, we may take j u(1)
as the cartan generator of su (2)k. the remaining background n(c=6)  n /su (2)k is
precisely a c = 6 cft, and small n = 4 spacetime supersymmetry requires that n(c=6)
have small n = 4 worldsheet supersymmetry. this can be shown by the methods in

[10], where it is argued that for compactication to four dimensional minkowski space
m4  n(c=9), n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry on m4 requires that n(c=9) factorize as
n(c=9) = n(c=6)  t 2 with small n = 4 worldsheet superconformal symmetry on n(c=6).
the large n = 4 superconformal algebra (see [4] and references therein) has an ane
su (2)  su (2)  u (1) r-symmetry. again, as explained in [1,4], this spacetime ane
algebra arises from a worldsheet algebra su (2)k  su (2)k  u (1) where the levels are
related to the level k of the ads3 factor by 1/k = 1/k + 1/k. this implies that the
central charge of the su (2)k  su (2)k  u (1) factor is c = 21/2 6/k, and so completely
determines n (2.6). for the construction of section 3, we may take j u(1) as the diagonal
cartan generator of su (2)k  su (2)k; this implies that h2 of (3.1) above is h4 of
equation (2.31) in [4].

to construct n = 3 spacetime superconformal models, we may for instance take a z2

quotient of the large n = 4 model in such a way as to preserve 3 out of 4 spacetime super-

symmetries. this is worked out in detail in [6]; the basic idea is to take the construction
of [4] with k = k and quotient by a z2 action that exchanges the two su (2) factors in n
and simultaneously reects the u (1) factor in n . since the j u(1) current we use is in the
diagonal of su (2)  su (2) and hence inert under this quotient, the construction survives
and gives an n = 2 subalgebra of the n = 3 spacetime superconformal algebra discussed

in [6].

in models with enhanced spacetime superconformal symmetries, one has to take some
care in choosing j u(1), as an arbitrary choice may lead to supercharges that are not mutu-

ally local with the spacetime r-symmetries, and thus preserve only the n = 2 subalgebra

(3.10).

7

6. examples and discussion

we close with a few remarks:

1. the construction of section 3 can be used to nd many new examples of ads3  n
string backgrounds with spacetime superconformal symmetry. a broad class is given
by n = u (1)  nks where nks is a kazama-suzuki model [14] with central
charge c = 9  6/k. kazama-suzuki models are gauged n = 1 wzw models
g/h with an enhanced n = 2 worldsheet superconformal symmetry. the cases
(su (2)k  u (1)4)/u (1) or (su (2)k  su (2)k  u (1))/u (1) are precisely the cases
with enhanced spacetime superconformal symmetry discussed above. a simple new
case is, for instance, su (3)4k/u (1)2.

2. when the background has an enhanced worldsheet ane algebra, the construction of

section 3 can be generalized; in particular, if the enhanced algebra includes an extra
ane u (1)2 factor, n > 2 spacetime symmetries can be constructed as in [4].

3. the construction we have given here leads to conf ormal spacetime supersymmetries

of the boundary cft of ads3. other constructions of spacetime supersymmetry are
possible, such as the construction with respect to the u (1)r of the total worldsheet
n = 2 superconformal symmetry of ads3 n (see, e.g., appendix b of [1]). these in
general correspond to dierent string vacua dened on the same -model background,
and do not give rise to spacetime conformal symmetries2. it would be interesting to

know if the construction given here is the unique one that does lead to spacetime con-

formal symmetry (modulo the ambiguity noted in the previous paragraph for spaces
with u (1)2 factors).
