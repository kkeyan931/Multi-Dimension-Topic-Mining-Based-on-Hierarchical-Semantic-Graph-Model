abstract

we investigate systematically the asymptotic dynamics and symmetries of all three-dimensional

extended ads supergravity models. first, starting from the chern-simons formulation, we show

explicitly that the (super)anti-de sitter boundary conditions imply that the asymptotic symme-

try algebra is the extended superconformal algebra with quadratic nonlinearies in the currents.

we then derive the super-liouville action by solving the chern-simons theory and obtain a real-

ization of the superconformal algebras in terms of super-liouville elds. finally, we discuss the

possible periodic conditions that can be imposed on the generators of the algebra and generalize

the spectral ow analysed previously in the context of the n -extended linear superconformal al-

gebras with n  4. the (2 + 1)-ads/2-cft correspondence sheds a new light on the properties
of the nonlinear superconformal algebras. it also provides a general and natural interpretation

of the spectral ow.

introduction

the connection between dieomorphism-invariant theories in d + 1 dimensions and conformal eld

theories in d dimensions is a fascinating subject [1, 2, 3, 4]. one of the simplest contexts in which

it has been studied is the case of 2 + 1 dimensions, for which it has been proved more than ten years

ago that pure chern-simons theory [5] on a manifold with boundary induces the wess-zumino-

witten model [6] on the boundary [7, 8, 9]. this context is also particularly rich since the conformal

group on the boundary is innite-dimensional.

as it has been realized, the detailed correspondence between d + 1 and d dimensions strongly

depends on the precise form of the boundary conditions. so, while one gets the wzw model with

the natural boundary conditions of [8, 9], one gets dierent theories if one adopts other boundary

conditions. this feature is relevant to 2 + 1 gravity with a negative cosmological constant (ads

gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions), which may be viewed as a chern-simons theory with gauge group

so(2, 2) at least as far as the equations of motion are concerned. [10, 11]. it has been shown in [12]

that the anti-de sitter asymptotics [13] lead to the liouville theory at innity (up to zero modes).

in terms of the cs/wzw correspondence, one may undertand this result as due to the fact that

the ads asymptotic conditions are stronger than the boundary conditions of [8, 9] and enforce the

hamiltonian reduction from sl(2, r)-wzw to liouville theory [14, 15, 16, 17].

the purpose of this paper is to extend the analysis to the supersymmetric case. a rst step in

this direction was taken in [18, 19], where the case n = 1 was considered and shown to lead either

to the ramond or neveu-schwarz superalgebras at innity, depending on the periodicity conditions

on the gravitino eld. the extended models were not treated in detail. this is done here.

after a brief review of ads supergravity (section 2), we provide asymptotic conditions on all

the elds. these conditions are geometrically motivated and chosen to enforce ads asymptotics.

we then show that they automatically imply that the asymptotic superconformal algebras are the

2

superconformal algebras with non linearities in the currents discussed in [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]

(section 3). furthermore, the (classical) virasoro central charge is equal to 6k = 3/2g for all

models. the analysis is done by identifying in the (2 + 1)-chern-simons formulation the generators

of the asymptotic symmetries as appropriate surface terms at innity and then computing their

algebra. in sections 4 and 5, we give a dynamical explanation of the origin of these symmetries

by relating explicitly the extended supergravity actions to the extended super-liouville ones. a

few ne points (e.g., implementation of the reduction constraints inside the action) are carefully

analysed. finally, in section 6, we discuss the spectral ow [26]. dierent moddings for the

generators of the superconformal algebras can be adopted, leading to apparently dierent algebras.

however, some of these algebras are in fact related by the so-called spectral ow introduced in [26]

for the linear superconformal algebras. we close our paper with a concluding section, followed by

an appendix, in which we discuss the role of zero modes and holonomies in the liouville model

arising from 2 + 1 gravity and their relation to the sign of the liouville potential.

the interest of extended ads supergravity models in the context of the ads/cft correspon-

dence is at least threefold:

1. first, the treatment sheds a new light on the properties of the nonlinear algebras of [20, 21,

22, 23, 24, 25]. in particular, it provides a physical explanation for the relation between the

superconformal algebras and superalgebras found algebraically in [23, 24, 25]. the supercon-

formal algebra is the boundary symmetry of an ads supergravity theory in the chern-simons

formulation with the superalgebra as a gauge group.

2. second, one automatically gets explicit realizations of these superconformal algebras in terms

of liouville elds.

3. third, the spectral ow gets a general and natural interpretation in the chern-simons frame-

work.

3

some of the results reported here are implicitly contained in the literature (see e.g. [27, 28, 29,

30]). however, no systematic and complete treatment is to our knowledge available. in view of the

recent interest in the ads/cft correspondence, we feel that such a treatment can be useful.

2 extended ads supergravities in three dimensions

2.1 superalgebras

as shown in [10], supergravity in 2 + 1 dimensions can be formulated as a pure chern-simons

theory based on an appropriate supergroup. the dreibein, the gravitini and the gauge elds can

be combined in a super chern-simons connection. we denote the superalgebra by g=g0g1,
where g0 is the even part of the superalgebra and g1 the odd part. since we wish to describe
ads3 space-time, the even subalgebra g0 must contain sl(2; r) and be of the form g0 = sl(2; r)
eg. furthermore, the fermionic generators must transform as sl(2; r)-spinors. the dimension
of the internal algebra eg is denoted d = dim eg and  is the real, not necessarily irreducible
representation of eg (of dimension d = dim ) in which the fermionic generators transform.

these conditions are realized in only seven cases [31, 32], which are the following

in fact, this is also the list of superalgebras which can be associated with 2-dimensional super-

conformal algebras with quadratic non-linearities [23, 24, 25]. this is not an accident since, as we

shall see, the two are related by the ads/cft correspondence.

2.2 conventions

we follow [24] (see also [33]). we denote the basis of the representation  as a = (a)

f abcc, and take the structure constants f abc to be totally antisymmetric. the killing metric for

 ,ha, bi =

eg is gab = f acdf bcd = cvab where cv is the eigenvalue of the second casimir in the adjoint
vrepresentation of eg.

we also denote by c the eigenvalue of the second casimir in the representation :

aa = ci,

tr(ab) = 

d
d

cab =

d
d

c
cv

gab.

the representation  is orthogonal and admits a eg-invariant symmetric metric  = , with

inverse , which we will use to lower and raise the supersymmetry (greek) indices. one has

 = 

, (a) = (a)

  =  (a), and also (cid:16)ab(cid:17)

=(cid:16)ba(cid:17)

.

the superalgebra generators and commutators are:

 g0 generators : the sl(2;r) generators ta (a = 3, +,) are equal to 1

2 3, +, , and satisfy

the commutation relations:

2

(cid:20) 1
3, (cid:21) = 
3(cid:19)
(cid:2)+, (cid:3) = 2(cid:18) 1

the killing metric for sl(2;r) is:

4 hab

and in its 2-representation, tr(cid:16)tatb(cid:17) = 1
the eg generators are denoted t a (a = 1...d), and satisfy:
ht a, t bi = f abct c

these commute with all sl(2;r) generators.

(2.3)

 g1 generators : these are denoted by r ( = 1...d). their commutators with the sl(2;r)

generators are:

r

1
2

(cid:20) 1
3, r(cid:21) = 
(cid:2), r(cid:3) = 0
(cid:2), r(cid:3) = r.

their commutators with the eg generators are:

(cid:2)t a, r(cid:3) =  (a)

 r

the anticommutators of the fermion generators are:

the given superalgebras all admit a consistent, invariant, supersymmetric and nondegenerate

bilinear form which we denote by st r and which is dened by

2.3 action

using these conventions, we can parametrize a general element in g by:

(2.12)

2 +a+++a , b  bat a

,   +r++r. here a3, a+, a, ba

are commuting parameters and +,  anti-commuting grassman parameters.

the action describing supergravity in ads3 space-time is a dierence of two chern-simons

actions [10],

s[,e] = scs[]  scs[e]

(2.13)

where ,e  g are superalgebra valued super-connections. we assume for simplicity that  and
e take values in the same superalgebra, although this is not necessary. this choice leads to a

non-chiral model in two dimensions to which the results of sections 4 and 5 apply. scs is the super

chern-simons action, dened by:

scs[] =

(2.14)

the integration is over m - a 3-manifold, with topology d and k is related to the 3-dimensional
newton constant g through k = /4g where  is the anti-de sitter radius. furthermore, the

product of two fermions in this formula (as well as in (3.10) below but in no other formula) diers

by a factor i from the standard grassmann product fullling (ab) = ba (e.g., (2.14) contains

i(k/4)+  d st r(r+r) in terms of the standard grassmann product).

3 asymptotic symmetries - extended superconformal algebras

3.1 boundary conditions

the ground state of ads supergravity is anti-de sitter space with vanishing gravitini and gauge

elds. ads3 is the solution with the maximum number of isometries, namely 3 + 3 = 6 (3 per chiral

8

as under 2d + 2d rigid supersymmetries. the corresponding killing spinors are explicitly given in

sector). it is also invariant under constant eg  eg-transformations (d + d tansformations) as well
[18]. in short, ads3 is invariant under the superalgebra g  g.

besides ads3, there are other solutions, which dier from ads3 in their global properties [34].

the black-hole solution [35] is an important example and can be obtained from ads3 through

appropriate identications [36]. the boundary conditions to be imposed on the elds at innity

should allow for these physically interesting solutions.

it was shown in [13] that the appropriate conditions in the sl(2; r)-sector are, for r  ,

where we have switched to chiral coordinates: x = t and where l and el are arbitrary functions

of  and t. the factors of 2 are introduced for later convenience. (the asymptotic conditions were

actually expressed in terms of the metric in [13] but are easily veried to be equivalent to those

written here in terms of the connection).

in order to obtain the asymptotic boundary conditions for all components of the two supercon-

nections, we follow the general scheme introduced in [37, 19]. namely, we take a generic congura-

tion having the above asymptotic behaviour with vanishing gravitini and gauge elds and act on

it with the exact symmetries of ads3. in doing so, one generates new terms (since we start with

congurations which are not ads3) which typically behave as

manian), so we shall adopt (3.3) and (3.4) with arbitrary l, el, q, eq, b and eb as boundary
conditions. here, we have scaled the terms proportional to ba and eba with

(3.5)

kb = k

for later convenience.

3.2 asymptotic symmetries

2c
d  1

the boundary conditions at spatial innity give us the asymptotic form of the superconnections.

we work out in this subsection the gauge transformations that preserve the asymptotic form of the

superconnections (asymptotic symmetries). in what follows, we focus only on the superconnection

. the treatment for  is analogous and eventually gives another copy of the superconformal algebra

for the other chirality.

it is convenient to factor out the r dependence by performing a gauge transformation and to

work with the equivalent connection i dened by

i = bib1 + bib1

where b is a similarity transformation depending only on r:

b(r) = exp" 3

2

ln r# .

the components of i vanish asymptotically, except u (u  x+), given by

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

two things should be mentioned about the asymptotic form of u. first, there is no 3 component

and the term proportional to  is xed to be one. second, the fermion part of the superconnection

contains no r components. these conditions turn out to be crucial for obtaining the supercon-

formal algebra. note that there is a similar chirality condition on the fermions in 4 (or higher)

dimensions [37].

acting on the superconnection with an innitesimal gauge transformation:

in order to preserve the asymptotic form of the superconnection, the parameters of the gauge

taking as independent parameters   ,   , and a. the relations in question are then

where the prime denotes derivative with respect to the argument. the transformations with pa-

rameters subject to (3.12), (3.13) and (3.14) are the asymptotic symmetries.

3.3 superconformal algebra

in order to exhibit the algebra of the asymptotic symmetry transformations, we shall work out the

poisson bracket algebra of their generators. to that end, we rst need to identify these generators.

this is done by following the regge-teitelboim method [38]. the gauge transformations of the

chern-simons theory with parameters a  (3, , a, ) are generated in the equal-time
poisson bracket by the spatial integral g[] =r d2xaga + s, where (i) the ga are the chern-

simons constraints, equal to minus the factor of the temporal components of the superconnection

in the action; and (ii) s is a boundary term at innity chosen such that the variation g[] of the

generator g[] contains only undierentiated eld variations under the given boundary conditions

[38] (g[] has well-dened functional derivatives). if one follows this procedure, one gets (up to

the bulk term that vanishes on-shell),

gl [] = z d ()l()
gb [] = z d a()ba()
gq [] = z d i()q+().

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

thus, we see that l, q+ and ba are precisely the generators of the asymptotic symmetries. there

is no factor in (3.15), (3.16) or (3.17) because we included the appropriate factors in the denitions

of l, q+ and ba.

once the generators have been identied, one computes their poisson bracket algebra by using

the relationship f = {g[], f}p b , valid for any phase-space function, and working out l,
q+ and ba directly from the formulas of the previous subsections.

under the asymptotic ads subgroup, the transformation laws for the l, qs and bs are given

charge is equal to 6k for all models. it should be stressed, however, that we obtained the classical

2(cid:17)2pn(cid:16)babb(cid:17)n

ein. these are the non-linear

version of the algebra, where quantum eects of normal ordering are missing. such eects modify

the value of the coecients in the algebra.

thus, we have established that the boundary conditions of asymptotic ads on  lead to an

asymptotically superconformal symmetry algebra of the type discussed in [20, 21, 22, 23] and with

classical virasoro central charge equal to 6k. repeating this treatment for  leads to another copy

of the same superconformal algebra for the other chirality.

the above treatment gives a physical explanation for the relation between the superconformal

algebras and superalgebras found algebraically in [23, 24, 25]. the superconformal algebra is the

boundary symmetry of an ads supergravity theory in the chern-simons formulation with the

superalgebra as a gauge group.

4 deriving the super-liouville action from ads supergravity

4.1 super-wzw model

because 3-dimensional supergravity possesses the superconformal algebra as asymptotic symmetry

algebra, the dynamical theory describing its boundary degrees of freedom at innity is expected to

be superconformal. we show in this section that this is indeed the case and that the dynamical

theory in question is (extended) super-liouville theory. the procedure follows the approach of [12]

for gravity and we shall thus describe here the main lines, emphasizing only the ne points (for

related information concerning the relation between ads3-gravity and liouville theory, see [39, 40]).

the boundary conditions (3.3) and (3.4) on the superconnections  ande can be separated into

two subsets:

15

1. first, the v-components v (v  x) and the u-components eu of the superconnections along

all the generators of the superalgebra are zero,

v = 0, eu = 0

(4.1)

2. second, some of the u-components u and the v-components ev are constrained. more pre-

cisely, in terms of the redened superconnections i, one has



u = 1, 3

u = 0, u,  = 0; e+

v = 1, e3

v = 0, ev, + = 0.

it turns out that the analysis proceeds in much the same way if the currents 

are xed to arbitrary non-vanishing values. so, we shall relax 

v from their anti-de

sitter values and consider the more general conditions

(4.2)

u and e+

v

u and e+



u = , 3

u = 0, u,  = 0; e+

v = , e3

v = 0, ev, + = 0.

(4.3)

we shall rst take care of the conditions (4.1).

it has been shown in [8, 9] that pure chern-simons theory on a manifold with a boundary is

equivalent to a chiral wzw theory living on that boundary under conditions analogous to (4.1) (the

analysis of [8, 9] is straightforwardly adapted to cover the boundary conditions (4.1), see [12]). in

the present case, one gets two g-super-wzw theories on the cylinder (t, ) at innity, of opposite

chiralities since the boundary conditions on  and e are themselves of opposite parities. these

two copies can be combined to yield the vector g-super-wzw theory coupled to zero modes whose

explicit form depends on the topology of the manifold3.

3as a rule, we shall not write explicitly the zero mode terms in this section, so the action given below describes

only part of the dynamics. this is sucient for exhibiting the dynamical origin of the superconformal algebra at

innity. note that the zero modes contain in particular holonomy terms, which are not zero even for the anti-de sitter

ground state since we are using the spinor representation of sl2 [19]. a discussion on how to include the holonomies

is given in the appendix.

using the gauss decomposition for a general supergroup element,

g = e+e0e

where

e+ = exp(x+ + +r+) = exp(x+) exp(+r+)

e0 = exp(3 + c at a) = exp(3) exp(c at a)

e = exp(y + r) = exp(y) exp(r)

as well as the polyakov-wiegmann identity [41] for supermatrices, one gets the wzw action

4.2 kac-moody currents

as it is well known , the super wzw action has two sets (left and right) of conserved currents,

each set forming a super kac-moody algebra. with appropriate normalizations, the currents for the

two chiralities can be taken to be k

by

4.3 gauged theory

the variational principle that follows from 2+ 1 supergravity is in fact not (4.10), but rather, (4.10)

supplemented by the constraints (4.3) since the only competing histories occuring in the variational

20

principle of supergravity are required to fulll (4.3). in terms of the currents, the constraints are

simply

j  =

k
2

 ,

j 3 = 0 ,

f = 0 ,



k
2

ej + =
ej 3 = 0
ef+ = 0

(4.35)

(4.36)

(4.37)

(modulo holonomy terms discussed in the appendix). these are constraints on the canonical vari-

ables (with  expressed in terms of ), which we collectively denote by ga. thus, the action

for the theory is

s[, x, y, u, +, , , x, y, u, , +, a]

= sw zw

h

z dx+dxaga

(4.38)

where a are lagrange multipliers implementing the constraints.

it follows from the algebra of the currents that the constraints ga = 0 are second class; one

may split them into two subsets, ga = (i, i), in such a way that the is are rst class among

themselves and generate therefore a gauge symmetry, while the is can be viewed as gauge con-

ditions for the symmetry generated by the is (for information on constrained systems, see [43]).

for instance, one may take for i the constraints j   k
frequency part of the fermionic constraints [44]. the action (4.38) is thus the (gauge-xed version

2  = 0, ej +  k

2  = 0 and the positive

of the) action for the gauged wzw model, in which one has gauged the subsupergroup generated

by the rst class constraints.

as it is well known, this model is equivalent to super-liouville theory (see [14, 15, 16] for the

bosonic case, and [44, 45, 46] for some of the fermionic cases). this is demonstrated in the next

subsection for all extended models.

21

4.4 super-liouville action

the constraints ga = 0 enable one to eliminate x, y, , +, x, y from the action. [as demon-

strated by lagrange himself, solving the constraints inside the action or taking them into account

with the help of (lagrange) multipliers are two equivalent procedures]. when doing so, one gets a

reduced action sr

h which depends on the remaining variables, i.e., , u, +, , , u and which

is precisely the super-liouville action.

indeed, the constraints imply

5 realization of superconformal generators in terms of liouville

elds

5.1 construction of generators

the symmetries of the super-liouville action can be understood in terms of the symmetries of the

original, ungauged, wzw action.

the superwzw model is conformal, the generators l,el being elements of the enveloping algebra

of the current algebra dened by the sugawara construction:

{el(),eai ()} =eai ()(  )

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.4)

(5.5)

the ungauged superwzw model is, however, not superconformal, in the sense that there are

in general no superpartners to l,el that would close with them according to the superconformal

algebra. what is remarkable is that once we gauge the superwzw, i.e., impose the rst class

constraints

j  =

k
2

,

f >

k

,

ej + =

ef >

(where > denotes the positive frequency part), we not only maintain conformal invariance but in fact

gain superconformal invariance. indeed, one can nd polynomials in the kac-moody currents that

(i) preserve the constraints; and (ii) close in the poisson brackets according to the superconformal

algebra modulo terms that vanish when (5.5) hold.

in the reduced theory obtained by strongly enforcing all the constraints (gauge constraints

ignore terms which vanish with the constraints and we consider as equivalent, generators which

reduce to the same expression on the constraint surface. this is of course the standard procedure

for constrained systems and it lies at the heart of the hamiltonian formulation of brst theory

[43].

when all the constraints (rst and second class) are imposed, the generator q reduces to f+



and eq reduces to ef, while the generators bl and ebl reduce to j +  
baba and +fj  +
kb ebaeba respectively. therefore, one can also view the superconformal generators as the rst-class

extensions [43] of the kac-moody currents that are not constrained by the reduction.

where the time derivatives are expressed in terms of the canonical variables using the equations of

motion. the poisson brackets of the generators are those of the superconformal algebra. this can

be directly veried from (5.30), (5.31) and (5.32) using the poisson brackets for the super-liouville

eld components and their spacetime derivatives that follow from the equations of motion and the

basic canonical brackets, but the property actually also holds if one regards the super-liouville eld

as free. this fact is familiar from chiral quantization [42].

the realization of the poisson bracket superconformal algebra in terms of the super-liouville

elds can also be used in order to construct realizations for the quantum superconformal algebras.

the classical expressions (5.30), (5.31) and (5.32) become the quantum generators, some of the

coecients getting corrections of order h. the expressions with the correct normalizations appear

in a paper by bina and gunaydin [33].

5.3 symmetry transformations

one can work out the superconformal transformations of the elds by computing their poisson

brackets with the generators. for completeness, we list the innitesimal symmetry transformations

of all elds for the tilded chirality superconformal generators:

one can easily verify that the super-liouville action is indeed invariant under these transfor-

mations.

a special situation occurs for the su (1, 1|2)/u (1) (small n = 4) case. writing the fermions
as 2  2 matrices, the super-liouville action has an alternative su (2) symmetry obtained by
multiplication from the left of the fermionic matrix without involving the wz action. this generates

at the classical level an alternative n = 4 superconformal algebra. the quantum realization of this

algebra was discussed in [47] and used recently in a physically interesting context in [49].

6 classication of extended conformal algebras and spectral ow

realizing the superconformal algebras as boundary theories of chern- simons actions allows a uni-

ed treatment of their classication following from dierent possible moddings of the generators.

some of these apparently dierent algebras are related by the so called spectral ow  trans-

formations [26]. this feature also gets a general and natural interpretation in the chern-simons

framework .

we follow closely [26]. both aspects mentioned above are related to the behaviour of the

29

fermionic generators under the extended kac-moody symmetry. this behaviour, in turn, must

be such that the action (2.17) is single-valued. for convenience, we will denote in this section:

  +,   .

as discussed in the previous sections the physical hilbert space is realized in terms of represen-

tations of the boundary superconformal algebra. a given chiral representation is dened by h , the

eigenvalue of the l0 virasoro operator and a highest weight  of the kac-moody algebra. pairing

the left and right representations, we construct the physical hilbert space. the highest weight ~ is

measured by the holonomy p exp(r ib d) around the boundary of the disk. for a given holonomy
exp(i2), where   ~. ~h, hi being the generators in the cartan subalgebra, regularity at the
center of the disk (origin) requires the coupling of the b0 eld to a source at the origin in the

representation  [9]; the action of the source is given by:

z dt t r[1(0 + b0)(t)]

(6.1)

alternatively one can quantize the c-s theory on an annulus and require that the holonomies on

the two boundaries are the same.the source at the center of the disk represents the zero- mode of

the elds on the interior boundary.

we start by discussing the possible boundary conditions on the elds in (2.17). this will provide

us with the classication of the superconformal algebras living on the boundary.

the topology of the ads3 manifold is d  . parametrizing d by r,  the elds could have
nontrivial periodicity conditions as a function of  provided the lagrangian density remains strictly

periodic (single valued). in a real basis, the kinetic terms of the ,  are invariant under a o(d)

transformation, where d is the dimension of the real representation  of the compact gauge group eg
(extended symmetry) under which the gravitini transform. in this section, eg denotes the internal

group (and not its lie algebra). therefore one can have the nontrivial periodicity conditions:

( + 2) = g()

( + 2) = ()g1

(6.2)

30

where g is an arbitrary element of o(d) and we made explicit just the  dependence of the elds.

we can make, however, a change of variables in the functional integral  = g ,  =  g1 which

would leave the kinetic term form invariant. as a consequence g and g1gg in (6.2) are equivalent

and the boundary conditions depend really only on conjugacy classes of o(d). therefore the g in

(6.2) can be taken to be a generic element in the cartan torus of so(d) or one xed matrix g0 in

o(d) with determinant 1.

we start analyzing the continuous, cartan torus part. in the presence of the gauge couplings,

group and f a residual avour group. for the supergroups listed in table 1 the avour group

o(d) is not anymore a symmetry. the continuous part is broken to eg  f , eg being the gauge
exists just for su (1, 1|2)/u (1) when it is su (2).
it is convenient to consider the fermionic elds in the cartan basis of eg, i.e. ~ , ~, where ~ is a
weight of the gauge group eg in the representation . in this basis the transformations (6.2) become

phase transformations. in order to keep the lagrangian strictly periodic also the gauge elds b

should acquire nontrivial periodicity conditions: the kac-moody algebra must be twisted [50].

these are best studied if we use the cartan basis for the gauge elds, i.e., we expand the

connection b in terms of the raising and lowering operators e~ and the operators in the cartan

subalgebra hi i = 1, ..., r, ~ being roots and r the rank of the group eg:

b = b~e~ + bihi

(6.3)

then it is easy to see that the periodicity conditions which will leave the lagrangian single valued

are:

and

~( + 2) = exp(i~a.~)a
a

~()

~( + 2) = exp(i~a.~) a
 a

~()

(6.4)

ba

~( + 2) = exp(i~a.~)ba

~()

where ~a has r continuous components.

31

ba

i ( + 2) = ba

i ()

(6.5)

in addition, for the su (1, 1|2)/u (1) case, when a avour symmetry exists, there is an overall

u (1) phase transformation (the cartan torus of the avour group) aecting only the fermions:

~( + 2) = exp(ib)~()

~( + 2) = exp(ib)~()

(6.6)

we discuss now the periodicity conditions related to the discrete element g0 . a necessary

condition for the discrete operation g0 to be compatible with the gauging is that each gauge eld

acts in a real representation. in particular, when the group eg is not simple, each component of 
corresponding to a factor of eg should be real.

the action of the discrete element g0 on the fermions induces an action on the gauge elds

through the conjugation of the representation matrices. when d is odd, g0 can be taken propor-

tional to the unit matrix and therefore commutes with the representation matrices and the gauge

elds are not aected. this situation is realized for osp(n|2; r) n = odd and g(3) in table 1
which could have therefore, discrete twisted boundary conditions for the fermions. when d is

even the representation matrices are aected and the transformation is compatible with gauging

if it corresponds to an outer automorphism of the group. this situation is realized only for the

osp(n|2; r) n = even case when the so(n ) group has a z(2) automorphism: parity. therefore
among the superconformal algebras only osp(n|2; r) for all n , and g(3) will have discrete twisted
versions.

the number of continuous parameters characterizing the algebra can be easily read o from

table 1 :

[n/2] for osp(n|2; r), 4 for f (4), 2 for g(3), n for su (1, 1|n ), 2 for su (1, 1|2)/u (1), m + 1 for
osp(4|2m ) and 2 for d(2, 1; ).

however, algebras having dierent values of the continuous parameters can be isomorphic. this

feature, the spectral flow, can be easily understood in the c-s framework. indeed, we can make

a change of variable from the elds having nontrivial periodicity properties (6.4), (6.5), which have

32

an upper index a, to elds which are strictly periodic and which we denote without an index:

a

~() = exp(i~a.~ /2)~()

ba

~() = exp(i~a.~ /2)b~()

(6.7)

we supplement (6.7) with a change of variable also for the elds ba

i which were periodic:

ba

i () = bi() + ai/2

the change of variables (6.7), (6.8) corresponds formally to a gauge transformation:

u() = exp(i~a. ~h /2)

(6.8)

(6.9)

since the gauge group element u is not periodic, as a gauge transformation (6.9) is not legal.

nevertheless we can use it as a change of variable which will leave the bulk part , eq.(2.17), of the

c-s action form invariant when expressed in terms of the unindexed, strictly periodic variables.

the source term, eq.(6.1), will not be invariant. the change can be easily calculated from

the consistency requirement of the holonomy. since through the change of variables an amount

exp(i~a. ~h/2) was removed from the holonomy, when written in terms of the unindexed variables

the source term should have   a/2 instead of .

therefore all dependence on continuous parameters in the boundary conditions which can be

related to the gauge group eg is removable. it is obvious that a similar procedure for the continuous

dependence related to the avour symmetry or for the discrete boundary conditions would not

apply.

the above discussion can be used in a straightforward fashion to obtain properties of the su-

perconformal algebras. as discussed in section 3 the c-s elds become directly the generators of

the algebras. therefore the possible periodicity conditions of the generators of the superconformal

transformations q are identical to the conditions (6.4) of the gravitino elds once a cartan basis is

used. the accompanying periodicity conditions of the kac-moody generators b follow from the pe-

riodicity conditions of the gauge elds (6.5). the enumeration given above of the possible boundary

33

conditions for the various c-s theories applies directly to the possible periodicities (moddings)

of the generators in the corresponding superconformal algebras.

thus the change of variable removing dependences on continuous parameters gives the relation

between algebras with dierent moddings, i.e. the spectral ow:

qa

~() = exp(i~a.~ /2)q~()

ba

~() = exp(i~a.~ /2)b~()

ba

i () = bi() + ai/2

(6.10)

(6.11)

where we used the cartan basis for the generators.

the highest weight ~a irrep of the algebra with modding a, is mapped into an irrep with

highest weight ~ of the ramond (completely periodic) algebra. the weights are related by:

~a = ~ + ~a/2

(6.12)

we remark that since the spectral ow involves only the elds carrying kac-moody quantum

numbers, it wouldnt aect the part of the virasoro generator coming from the sl(2) elds. the

ow in the total virasoro generator can be read o from the ow of the sugawara part which was

added to it, as discussed in section 3. from the explicit sugawara expression in terms of b and

eq. (6.11) we obtain the ow of the virasoro generator l():

bla() = l() + 1/[(k + h)] ~b().~a + 1/[42(k + h)]~a.~a

(6.13)

summarizing: besides the completely periodic (ramond) modding for all the cases listed in

table 1 the superconformal algebras admit the following independent moddings:

a) discrete twisted modding for the osp(n|2; r) series (including the n = 2, 3 and large

n = 4 superconformal algebras studied before ) and g(3) .

b) a modding depending on one continuous parameter for the su (1, 1|2)u (1) ( small n = 4)

superconformal algebra.

all the other moddings for all the algebras are related to the above by spectral ow.

7 conclusions

in this paper, we have analyzed in detail the ads/cft correspondence for extended supergravity

in 2 + 1 dimensions. we have shown how the superconformal algebras with nonlinearities in the

currents arise as asymptotic symmetry algebras. we have also shown that the dynamics of the

asymptotic elds is controlled by the super-liouville lagrangian.

the ads/cft correspondence enlightens the properties of the non-linear superconformal alge-

bras and provides a systematic discussion of the spectral ow.

we conclude by pointing out two questions that could be worth pursuing. first, it would be

interesting to try to understand the mechanism of [51] from a pure three-dimensional point of view

(see [52] in this context). second, one might extend the analysis to the ads2/super-conformal

quantum mechanics along the lines of [53, 54, 55]. the extensions to the quasiconformal case (in

the sense of [24]) and to toda models (super w -algebras) [56] could also be of interest.

appendix

in this appendix, we indicate where zero modes and holonomies arise in the derivation of the super-

liouville action from the supergravity action. we show in particular that 2+1 supergravity only

35

yields the ordinary super-liouville lagrangian modulo zero mode and holonomy terms, one striking

dierence being that the holonomies in the right and left sectors are independent in supergravity.

the analysis sheds as a by-product some interesting light on the sign of the exponential term in

the liouville action.

since the subtleties arise already in the non-supersymmetric case, we shall drop the fermions

in order to keep the formulas simple. thus, our starting point is the action for ordinary gravity,

sha, eai =

d3x{

er +

e
2}

(a.1)

where a and ea are related to the dreibeins and the connection through (2.15) and (2.16). this

action can be written as the dierence between two sl(2, r)-chern-simons actions.

the rst step follows the references [8, 9, 12] and consists in solving the gauss constraints

f a

ij = 0, ef a

ij = 0 (i, j spatial indices) in the bulk, taking into account the rst set of boundary

conditions (4.1). we shall assume that the spatial sections have the annulus topology, as this is the

case relevant to the black holes. as shown in [9], the solution of the gauss constraints is then

a = g1k(t)g + g1g,

ar = g1rg

(a.2)

(a.3)

where g(t, r, ) is a sl(2, r) group element and where k(t) is a lie-algebra element characterizing

the holonomy. under the transformation g(t, r, )  (t)g(t, r, ), k(t) is conjugated by (t).
using this freedom, one can bring k(t) along 3 (the black hole holonomy is hyperbolic and we

restrict therefore the analysis to this case),

k(t) = k 3(t)

3
2

.

(a.4)

similar formulas hold for the tilde sector.

if one inserts the solution of the gauss constraints inside the chern-simons action supplemented

36

by the surface term appropriate to the boundary conditions (4.1), one gets

s = s + shor

(a.5)

where  and hor refer respectively to the outer and inner boundaries. we are interested here in
the piece s describing the dynamics at innity, given by

here, h(t, ) is the value of g(t, r, ) on the outer boundary (we assume that the r-dependent

asymptotics) and

e = h1k(t)h + h1h

(a.8)

the holonomy k(t) appears also in the action shor describing the dynamics at the inner boundary,

but not h(t, ). similarly, the action for the other chirality is

at this point, one can proceed in two dierent ways. one can either rst recombine the two

chiralities to get the vector wzw model (modulo holonomies and zero mode terms) and then,

implement the hamiltonian reduction enforced by the second set of constraints (4.3). this was the

method followed in [12]. alternatively, one can rst implement the reduction constraints (4.3) and

then discuss how to recombine the two (reduced) chirality sectors. this is the approach followed

here.

consider rst the untilde sector. using the gauss decomposition4

h = exp () exp (3) exp (+)

(a.12)

one nds that the action takes the form

with t r(cid:0)h1k(t)h(cid:1) given explicitly by

t r(cid:16)h1k(t)h(cid:17) = k 3(t) [  exp(2)]

while the constraint (4.3) on the untilde current reads

 exp (2)  k 3 exp (2) = .
+ k 3 exp (2) = 0

k 3

(a.14)

(a.16)

the rst of these constraints enables one to express  in terms of k 3 and ; this can be veried by

fourier expansion of  and exp (2); note the crucial role played by the holonomy, which must
be non zero for the zero-mode part of the equation to make sense. the relationship between  and

 is non-local in . the second of these constraints can be rewritten as

4the global aspects of the gauss decomposition are discussed in [57].

38

and enables one to express  in terms of k 3 and  ( 6= 0).

thus, one can completely get rid of  and .

if one does so, one gets a reduced action

i r[(t, ), k 3(t)] that involves only (t, ) and k 3(t). its expression is straightforward to work

out but it is rather awkward and will not be given here. suce it to note that the k 3-independent

part of i r is just the action for a free chiral boson [58]

i r =

k

z dtd [] + (k 3  terms)

(a.18)

and does not contain  (in particular, it is independent of the sign of ). the (unwritten) piece

involving k 3 in (a.18) is anyway incomplete since k 3 occurs also in the action shor describing

the dynamics on the inner boundary. similarly, the improved virasoro generator is given by

(the minus sign is due to our conventions) and again, does not depend on .

(a.22)

the rst term is again the action for a chiral boson, of opposite chirality. note that the hamiltonians

for the chiral bosons (dropping holonomy terms) are both positive denite.

one can now recombine the two chiralities. first, consider the solutions of the equations of

motion. the chiral elds  and e depend on x+ and x, respectively. dene

exp 2 =

+f ef
[1  f ef ]2

with +f = exp (2) and ef = exp (2e). it is easy to see that  is a solution of the liouville

equation

+  exp 2 = 0.

one gets from the sum of the chiral actions for (,e) the liouville action (4.42) (with fermions

and gauge elds dropped). of course, the above transformation must be amended so as to be

well-dened on the circle; this leads to additional terms in the super-liouville action involving zero

modes and holonomies, which are crucial (furthermore, we have not investigated the global features

of the change of variables). thus, the action coming from 2+1 gravity is not just the vector liouville

action, there are further zero modes and holonomy terms. in particular, the holonomies k 3 andfk 3

are independent in 2+1 gravity. if the dierence of the holonomies is an integer (i.e. the zero-mode

conjugate to the dierence is an angular momentum variable) the cft on the boundary will still

be local. we shall not discuss explicitly the extra terms here, because for practical purposes, it is

more convenient not to recombine the chiralities and to regard the sum of the chiral actions (with

the holonomy terms) as dening the liouville model relevant to the asymptotic of 2 + 1 gravity5.

in the case of supergravity models with dierent number of supersymetries in the right and left

sectors, this is the only approach possible.

note that alternatively, we could have dened

the variable  is a solution of the liouville equation with standard sign,

exp 2 =

+f ef
[1 + f ef ]2

(a.26)

5thus, in particular, the super-liouville action given in the text does not fully describe 2+1 supergravity. the

+ + exp 2 = 0.

(a.27)

zero modes and holonomies are dierent. nevertheless, deriving the super-liouville action from 2+1 supergravity

(up to zero modes) is useful since it enables one to get straightforwardly the superconformal transformation laws.

liouville model [59, 60, 61]

brings the action to the standard liouville action. of course, the zero modes and holonomies enter

dierently this time. but, up to these terms, we see that one can change the sign in front of the

liouville exponential in the action by a (non-local, real) change of variables.
