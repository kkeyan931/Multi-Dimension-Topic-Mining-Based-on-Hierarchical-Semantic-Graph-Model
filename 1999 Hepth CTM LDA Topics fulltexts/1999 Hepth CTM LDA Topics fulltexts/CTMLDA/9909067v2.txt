abstract

the modular transformation properties of admissible characters of the ane su-
peralgebra sl(2|1; c)k at fractional level k = 1/u  1, u  n \ {1} are presented. all
modular invariants for u = 2 and u = 3 are calculated explicitly and an a-series and
d-series of modular invariants emerge.

1 introduction

in a series of papers [1, 2, 3], the properties of the ane superalgebra sl(2|1; c)k at frac-
tional level were extensively investigated. as well as the abstract interest, the motivation
for this work was in the potential relevance to the n = 2 non-critical string. the gen-
erally held notion that a non-critical (super)string is described in terms of a topological
g/g wess-zumino-novikov-witten model, with g a lie (super)group [4, 5, 6], provides
the link:
in order to describe the spectrum in the g = sl(2|1; r) case, believed to be
that related to the n = 2 string, a good understanding of sl(2|1; c)k at fractional level is
required. indeed, when the matter, which is coupled to supergravity in the n = 2 non-
critical string, is minimal, i.e. taken in an n = 2 super coulomb gas representation with
central charge

cmatter = 3(cid:18)1 

2p

u(cid:19) ,

p, u  n,

gcd(p, u) = 1,

(1.1)

it can be shown that the level of the matter ane superalgebra sl(2|1; c)k appearing in
the sl(2|1; r)/sl(2|1; r) model is of the form

k =

p
u

 1.

(1.2)

it is precisely these values of the level for which admissible representations of sl(2|1; c)k
do exist [7].

the present work builds immediately on that of [3], inheriting this motivation, but
also with pretensions to more general relevance in that we construct modular invariant
combinations of sl(2|1; c)k characters, which could be taken as starting points in the
building of partition functions for rational conformal eld theories.

we begin in section 2 by presenting the branching functions of so-called class iv and
class v sl(2|1; c)k characters1, where the level k = 1/u  1, u  n \ {1}. these branching
functions provide expressions for sl(2|1; c)k characters in terms of functions with known
modular transformation properties, facilitating the analysis of their behaviour under mod-
ular transformations.

the branching functions were rst calculated (actually conjectured, based upon analysis
for low values of u) in [3] for neveu-schwarz characters (corresponding to the twisted
version of sl(2|1; c)k). this was a natural starting point since the challenge here lies
in computing the eect of the modular s transformation    1
 , under which neveu-
schwarz characters transform into a linear combination of neveu-schwarz characters at the

1class i characters are modular forms rather than functions and it is not clear if they can be used to
construct modular invariants. class ii and class iii representations are believed to contain subsingular
vectors, making the computation of their characters extremely dicult; by contrast, classes iv and v
are believed to contain no subsingular vectors, making the calculation of their characters tractable. they
are also modular functions, justifying their role as the central objects of study. incidentally, those which
are singular in the limit   0 are related to n = 2 superconformal characters. see [1], [2] and [3] for
denitions and detailed exposition.

same level. however, we will go on to consider the question of forming modular invariant
combinations of characters: as the modular t transformation    + 1 takes neveu-
schwarz characters to supercharacters, which under s transform into ramond characters
(corresponding to the untwisted version of sl(2|1; c)k), we will require knowledge of the
modular transformation properties of these characters as well. to this end, we calculate
neveu-schwarz supercharacter and ramond character branching functions, simply derived
by spectral ow. under t , ramond characters do give back a combination of ramond
characters so consideration of this set is enough to allow us to form modular invariants;
however, for completeness we also consider ramond supercharacters, which form a closed
set under modular transformations.

having established branched expressions for the various sl(2|1; c)k characters such that
they are amenable to applying the modular s transformation, we proceed to do so in section
3. here we derive the action of the s transformation on the sl(2|1; c)k neveu-schwarz and
ramond characters and supercharacters at all levels k = 1/u  1, u  n \ {1}. we also
mention the action of the modular t transformation.

finally in section 4 we identify an a-series and d-series of modular invariants, based
on the appearance of such invariants in the two simplest cases of u = 2 and u = 3, the
details of which may be found in the appendices.

2 branching sl(2|1; c)k characters

in [3], branching formulae for the neveu-schwarz class iv and class v characters of
the ane superalgebra sl(2|1; c)k (k = 1/u  1) were conjectured. the characters were
branched into products of sl(2; c)k characters, generalised theta functions and string func-
tions, the modular transformation properties of which are known.

by denition, sl(2|1; c)k characters are given by

sl(2|1;c)k
h,h+



(, ,  ) d= tr exp{2i(j 3

0 + u0 +  l0)},

(2.1)

0 and u0 are the zero mode cartan generators of sl(2|1; c)k. we label the characters
where j 3
by the isospin and charge quantum numbers which characterise the sl(2|1; c)k highest
weight states |i of the associated representations2:

j 3
0 |i =

1
2

h|i, u0|i =

h+|i.

(2.2)

from ref. [8] we have the following expression for sl(2; c)k characters:

sl(2;c)k
n,n



(,  ) =

v+,w(cid:0) 

u , (cid:1)  v,w(cid:0) 
u , (cid:1)

1,2(,  )  1,2(,  )

,

(2.3)

2see [1, 2] for more details. it is conditions on these quantum numbers that split the representations

into the classes mentioned earlier.

where the level is parametrised as

k =

t
u

,

gcd(t, u) = 1,

u  n,

t  z,

with 0 6 n 6 2u + t  2 and 0 6 n 6 u  1 and

v

d= u((n + 1)  n(k + 2)),

w d= u2(k + 2).

in the above, the generalised theta functions m,m [9] are dened as

m,m(,  ) d=xnz

qm(n+ m

2m )2

zm(n+ m

2m ).

the variables q and z are dened by

q d= exp(2i ),
z d= exp(2i).

(2.13)

we now state the formulae for the branching of sl(2|1; c)k neveu-schwarz characters

as conjectured in [3]. the result for class iv characters reads

as we will come to consider the characters and supercharacters of the ramond sector
and the supercharacters of the neveu-schwarz sector, we mention that the neveu-schwarz
supercharacters have the same quantum numbers as the characters while the ramond
characters and supercharacters have

to obtain the neveu-schwarz supercharacters, we must shift the variable    + 1
 (this procedure corresponding to an

in (2.14) and (2.15), then divide the results by eihn s
insertion of the operator (1)f in the denition of the character). for class iv we nd

on applying the modular s transformation to a particular character, we obtain a lin-
ear combination of class iv and class v characters. the calculation of the eect of s in

6

the general case is thus simplied by combining the branched sl(2|1; c)k formulae. (we
also recall here that s applied to neveu-schwarz characters gives a linear combination of
neveu-schwarz characters, whereas s applied to ramond characters gives neveu-schwarz
supercharacters and vice versa; ramond supercharacters transform into themselves.) ex-
amining the neveu-schwarz branching formulae (2.14) and (2.15), we see that the substi-
tution m = m  m  1, m  = u  1  m in the class v formula (2.15) gives us precisely the
class iv formula (2.14). since 0 6 m +m  6 u2, these new values of m = u2m m 
and m = u  1  m  are those for which 0 6 m < m 6 u  1, whereas for class iv we
have 0 6 m 6 m 6 u  1. we can use the same branching formula (2.14) for both class
iv and class v , with 0 6 m 6 u  1 and 0 6 m 6 u  1, but we must still use the relevant
m and m  and expressions for the class v quantum numbers to obtain the correct values
of hn s

 and hn s
+ .
the story for the ramond characters (2.25) and (2.26) is exactly the same; for the
neveu-schwarz and ramond supercharacters we must modify (2.27) and (2.29) slightly.
the nal versions of the branching formulae read (now labelling the sl(2|1; c)k characters

at rst sight the problem of extracting from this expression a linear combination of
neveu-schwarz characters (2.31) would appear a fairly challenging task. in fact we do not
need to proceed in this way. looking at (2.31), we see that taking only the a = b = 0 term
(say) provides us with a unique linear signature term for each neveu-schwarz character,
the coecient of which is necessarily the coecient of that particular character. this
signature takes the following form:

n s, sl(2|1;c)k

n,n

(, ,  )  

sl(2;c)k

the problem of computing the coecients of sl(2|1; c)k neveu-schwarz characters in (3.1)
is thus reduced to a simple matter of extracting the correct coecients for the signatures
(3.2). hence

however, this expression simplies considerably. the sum over b can trivially be per-
formed to give a factor u  1. the sum over a can also straightforwardly be found to give
a factor u + 1. hence the matrix entries sn s

we note that sn s and ssr are symmetric; that sr = (ssn s)t; that all of these matrices
are unitary; and that the matrices as calculated by brute force for u = 2 (as found in
[2]) and u = 3 (also calculated in [12] for the neveu-schwarz characters) given in the
appendices agree with the above results.

in order to consider modular invariant combinations of sl(2|1; c)k characters, we must
also know how they transform under the modular t transformation t : (, ,  )  (, ,  +
1). it can be shown that the action of t is as follows [2, 12]:

m,m

m,m

r, sl(2|1;c)k
n s, sl(2|1;c)k
sn s, sl(2|1;c)k

recalling that for class v characters (m < m) we must use the appropriate m and m  and
the class v formulae to calculate the conformal weights.

4 modular invariants

with the behaviour of sl(2|1; c)k characters under the modular s and t transformations
now established, we proceed by looking for modular invariant combinations of characters.
these could be taken as starting points in the building of partition functions for rational
conformal eld theories. the canonical example of this is of course the classication of
su(2) modular invariants, implying the classication of the minimal models, by cappelli,
itzykson and zuber [13] (see also [14]), with minimal superconformal models also considered
in [15]. it was found that these partition functions fell into an a-d-e pattern. this work
was extended to the case of admissible sl(2) representations by koh and sorba [16] and
lu [17], who obtained a complete classication of modular invariants.

although we do not attempt to obtain a full classication of fractional level sl(2|1; c)k
modular invariants here, we do nd all invariants for the cases u = 2 and u = 3, special
cases of which are analogous to the a- and d-series obtained in the su(2) case.
it is
straightforward to show that such modular invariants exist for all u > 2.

modular invariant combinations of characters take the form

z =

u1xm,m,n,n=0

n r

mm,nnr

m,mr

n,n + n n s

mm,nnn s

m,mn s

n,n

+ n sn s

mm,nnsn s

m,msn s

n,n +

u1xa,a,b,b=0

n sr

aa,bbsr

a,asr

b,b,

(4.1)

written in this way to emphasise the fact that the ramond supercharacters form a closed set
under modular transformations, whereas the remaining sectors mix as detailed previously.

11

for physical modular invariants, the nmm,nn must be non-negative integers. in addition,
the identity should be unique so n r
00,00 must be equal to 1 (the identity character in this
context is r

0,0).

for the case of u = 2, we nd two possibilities (see appendix):

clearly for non-negative integer entries, a  n. there are thus an innite number of
modular invariants, a phenomenon also observed in [17]. for u = 3 we nd a similar
situation, with an additional parameter:

for non-negative integer entries we require a  n, b  z+. the ordering of terms in these
matrices is as given in the tables a.1, a.2, b.1 and b.2. (note that as t interpolates
between neveu-schwarz characters and supercharacters, n n s = n sn s.)

in the cases (4.2) and (4.4), when a = 1 and b = 0, we nd that n r = n n s = i. this
diagonal invariant we nd at all levels, since the matrices s and t are unitary. with a = 1
and b = 0 in (4.3) and (4.5), the resulting expressions are permutation invariants of the
form

x m,m(m,m),

(m, m) = (m, (m  m) mod u).

(4.6)

(4.7)

where

alternatively, labelling the characters by (h, h+) this is equivalent (see earlier denitions)
to (h, h+) = (h, h+). we also see this pattern appearing in the ramond superchar-
acters (analysis of which we leave to the appendices). the question arises as to whether
such a permutation invariant can be found at other levels: in fact it is fairly easy to check
that such an invariant exists at all levels k = 1/u  1. these two situations are analogues
of the a- and d-series invariants of the su(2) case.

we might expect the d-type invariants to be related to an automorphism of the fusion
rules, in the manner of schellekens and yankielowicz [18]. this might additionally have
some description in terms of automorphisms of the sl(2|1; c) dynkin diagram [19]: however,
as we are dealing with a superalgebra, the dynkin diagram is not unique.
in fact, the
general question of fusion rules is not a trivial one for the situation of fractional level (i.e.
non-unitary) theories. both of these issues deserve continued attention.

13

5 conclusion

we have found expressions for the modular s transformation of sl(2|1; c)k characters at
fractional level k = 1/u  1. this has allowed us to calculate all modular invariants for
the cases u = 2 and u = 3, leading to the discovery of an a-series and d-series of modular
invariants. the derivation of the general s transformation of sl(2|1; c)k characters neatly
rounds o the work of [3] and enables us to look at modular invariants in this framework
of ane superalgebras at fractional level, a subject little studied. it would certainly be
interesting to have a complete classication of these invariants, generally a non-trivial
problem; however, it would not be unlikely that an a-d-e type classication along the lines
of [17] might appear, given the underlying presence of sl(2). we make no claims that these
invariants constitute fully-edged partition functions, given the complications entering at
fractional level: in these situations considering fusion rules requires the inclusion of elds
not corresponding to highest or lowest weight representations, as originally discovered for
fractional level sl(2) by awata and yamada [20]. work has also been done on the case
of fractional level sl(3)see for example [21], which also contains some discussion of the

sl(2) case. as to superalgebras, the fusion rules of admissible representations of cosp(1|2)

have been studied in [22]. it would be interesting to consider fusion rules in the present
context and attempt to realise a rational conformal eld theory based on fractional level
sl(2|1; c)k.

the supercharacters in each sector have the same quantum numbers as the corresponding
