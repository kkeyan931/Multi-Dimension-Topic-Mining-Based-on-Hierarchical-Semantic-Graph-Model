we evaluate exactly both the non-relativistic and relativistic fermion de-
terminant in 2+1 dimensions in a constant background eld at nite tem-
perature. the eect of nite chemical potential is also considered. in both
cases, the systems are decoupled into an innite number of 1+1 fermions by
fourier transformation in the -variable. the total eective actions demon-
strate non-extensiveness in the  dimension.

introduction

thanks to the exotic mathematical structure and the possible relevence to condensed matter
physics in two space dimensions, chern-simons(cs) models have drawn much attention in the past
decade [1][2](for a review, see [3]).the cs term can be either put in by hand , or more naturaly,
induced by fermion degrees, as a part of the original (eective) lagrangian.two properties of the cs
action are fundamental. one is that it is odd under parity transform due to the presence of three

dimensional levi-civita symbol. the other is that it is invariant under small gauge transforms
while non-invariant under large gauge transforms (those not to be continuously deformed to
unity and thus carrying non-trivial winding numbers)[4]. in the free spacetime whose topology
is trivial, the homotopy group 3 is trivial in the abelian case. but there may be nontrivial
large gauge transformations if the gauge elds are subject to non-trivial boundary conditions(for
a more recent discussion see[5]). in general, if there exists non-trivial 3, the quantum theory is
consistent only if the cs parameters are quantized. there then arises a problem:what happens to
the quantized parameters by quantum corrections? in the zero temperature, the induced cs term
is well-understood [6]-[10]. but at nite temperature, it was argued [11]that the coecient of the
cs term in the eective action for the gauge eld should remain unchanged at nite temperature.
yet, a naive perturbative calculation that mimics that at zero temperature leads to a cs term with
a parameter continuously dependent on the temperature[11]-[12]. therefore, the behavior under
gauge transforms seems to be temperature-dependent. the problem of quantum corrections to
the cs coecient induced by fermions at nite temperature was re-examined in[13] , where it was
concluded that, on gauge invariance grounds and in perturbation theory, the eective action for
the gauge eld can not contain a smoothly renormalized cs coecient at non-zero temperature.
obviously, it is neccessary to obtain some exact result in order to reconcile the contradiction. as
a toy model, the eective action of a (0+1) analog of the 2+1 cs system was exactly calculated
[14].
it shows that in the analog, the exact nite t eective action , which is non-extensive
in temperature, has a well-dened behavior under a large gauge transformation,independent of
the temperature, even though at any given nite order of a perturbation expansion, there is a
temperature dependence. so it implies that the discussions of the gauge invariance of nite
temperature eective actions and induced cs terms in higher dimensions requires consideration
of the full perturbation series. conversely, no sensible conclusions may be drawn by considering
only the rst nite number of terms in the expansion. the course of being exactly calculable is
that the gauge eld can be made constant by gauge-transformations. employing this trick, fosco
et.al. calculated exactly the parity breaking part of the fermion determinant in 2+1 dimensions
with a particular background gauge eld. for both abelian and non-abelian cases[15][16], and the
result agrees with that from the -function methed [5]. more general background gauge elds were
also considered[17]. all these works show that (restricted to that particular ad hoc conguration)
gauge invariance of the eective action is respected even when large gauge transformations are
considered.
it is now clear that the eective action induced by the fermion determinant is in
general a non-extensive quantity in space-time/temperature and this feature enables the eective
action preserve gauge invariance.

in the non-relativistic case, the eective action induced by the 2+1 fermion determinant was
studied in[18] perturbatively in order to investigate the possible relevence between chern-simons
theory and superconductivity, at both zero and nite temperature. since the determinant can
not be evaluated exactly for general background gauge elds, ref.[19] considered the case that the
gauge eld is that of a constant magnetic eld and discussed the induced quantum numbers. the
dierence between the perturbative (loop) calculations and the rigorous results in this special case

3

is demonstrative.

the eect of nite chemical potential should be taken into account whenever discussing the
statistical physics of a grand canonical ensemble. it was shown that in 1+1 dimensions, the non-
zero chemical potential may contribute a non-trivial phase factor to the partition function[20] .
the problem for an arbitrary background in 2+1 dimensions was tackled perturbatively in [21].
as ususal, gauge transform property of the eective action suers some temperature-dependence.
using the same technique as in [15], the eect on the parity-odd part of non-zero chemical potential
is considered in[22] but the parity-even part can not be obtained exactly for the background
therein. therefore, it is worthwhile considering the problem by exact computation with some
particular background. this is the topic of this paper. the layout of this paper is as follows.
in sections 2 and 3 we exactly evaluate the non-relativistic and relativistic fermion determinant
at nite temperature and nite density in a constant magnetic eld. section 4 is devoted to
conclusional discussions.

2 the non-relativistic case

the fermion lagrangian is[23]

where 6d = idi, i = 1, 2.d =  + iea, 0 = 3, 1 = i2, 2 = i1.e = |e|, and 1,2,3 are
the usual three pauli matrices. we choose representation of gamma matrices so that it gives the
correct sign of the zeeman energy. it can be calculated directly that

(2)

where b = e/2m, gs = 2 is the electron g-factor for spin. we incorporate an external led b in
order to discuss the spin. the euclidean action at nite temperature and nite density reads then

le = [d 

1
2m

6d2  bsz + ]

(3)

the eective action  is given by denition

e = za.b.c.

dd exp{z 

0

d z d2x[d  

1
2m

 6d2 +   bsz]}

(4)

where the a.b.c. implies that the functional integral over the fermion elds is implemented with
anti-periodic boundary conditions. once  is known, the induced particle number and spin are
provided by

< n >= z d2x <  >= 

b=0

z d2x < sz >= 

1



b

b=0

(5)

(6)

where we have used the fact that the correlation functions in (5) and (6) are actually -independent.
since the exact evaluation of the functional integration in (4) in general is beyond our ability

so far, we rst consider those backgrounds of the following spacetime dependence as in[15]

a = a ( ),

ai = ai(x)

(7)

then the gauge eld can be rendered constant in time  by gauge transformations. the time
0 d a ( ), which can not be transformed away

component a will be its average value a = 1r 

by local transformations. in this gauge, we can employ the fourier transformation

(b = b  gsbb) where we have used the transformation of the functional measure

which can be easily proved from the orthonormality of the basis {1/2ein } in the fourier
2m(d2) + bsz are
transformation. it can be seen easily that once the eigenvalues of the operator 1
known, the functional integration can be accomplished readily. unfortunately, this is impossible
for general gauge eld backgrounds, even for the restricted class (7). therefore, we need to make
further restrictions. the simplest case is that the magnetic eld fij is constant f12 = b and the
the corresponding gauge potential can be chosen in the gauge a = (by, 0). in this case, the
eigenvalues of the operator 1

2m (d2) + bsz can be acquired from the solutions of the equation

{

where  is a two-component spinor and pi = ii . the solutions to (11) are easy to nd and the
eigenvalues can be obtained from the well-known landau levels,i.e.

these energy levels are highly degenerate with degeneracy |eb|2 per unit area which must be taken
into account when calculating the fermion determinant.

(13)

there is one important point that deserves attention here. in the absence of external magnetic
eld, the hamiltonian is just that of a free electron and the energy eigenvalue spectrum is contin-
uous which can not be regarded simply as the limit of the discrete spectrum for vanishing external
eld. since the numerator is

at zero temperature, these results coincide with those of [19]

the lagrangian of the fermion is

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

there are two inequivalent representations of the -matrices in three dimensions: = (3, i2, i1)
and  = (3, i2, i3). we choose the rst. as usual, the total eective action (a, m, )
at nite temperature is dened as

e(a,m,) = z dd  exp[z 

0

d z d2x (/ + ie 6a + m  3)]

(22)

where we are using euclidean dirac matrices in the representation  = (3, 2, 1), and  is the
inverse temperature. it makes no dierence whether the indices are lower or upper. the label 3
refers actually to the euclidean time component. the fermion elds are subject to antiperiodic
boundary conditions while the gauge eld are periodic. under parity transformation,

x1  x1, x2  x2, x3  x3;   1,    1; a1  a1, a2  a2, a3  a3

(23)

6

( matrices are kept intact). so only the mass term varies under the parity transformation. as
in [15], the parity-odd part is dened as

2(a, m, )odd = (a, m, )  (a, m, )

(24)

it is not an easy task to calculate (22) for general conguration of the gauge eld. a particular
class of congurations of a for which (22) can be exactly computed is that dened by (7). this
class of gauge elds shares the same feature as in the 0+1 dimensions in[14]: the time dependence
of the time component can be erased by gauge transformations. therefore, the euclidean action
can be decoupled as a sum of an innite 1+1 actions

e(a,m,) = z dn(x)d n(x) exp{
where /d = j(j + ieaj) is the 1+1 dirac operator and a3 is the mean value of a3( ).
it is
seen that the chemical potential in 2+1 dimensions plays the role of a chiral potential in 1+1
dimensions. let us introduce n for convenience, n = n + e a3. since

xz d2x n(x)[/d + m + i3(n + e a3)  3]n(x)} (25)

where

and

we have therefore

m + i3n  3 = nei3n

e2in =

m   + in
m +   in

n = q(m +   in)(m   + in)

det(/ + ie 6a + m  3) =

+

yn=

det[/d + nei3n]

explicitly, the 1+1 determinant for a given mode is a functional integral over 1+1 fermions

det[/d + nei3n] = z dnd n exp{z d2x n(x)(/d + nei3n)n(x)}

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

after implementing a chiral rotation whose jaccobian is wellknown (the fujikawa method applies
also to complex chiral parameters), we obtain

det[/d + m + i3(n + e a3)  3] = jndet[/d + n]

(31)

(32)

where

jn = exp(i

2 z d2xjkjak)

note that the chiral anomalies, or the jaccobianj, dependes on the boundary conditions as well.
if the system is dened on a torus and the elds are subject to periodic boundary conditions,
for instance ,aj(x, y) = aj(x + lx, y), aj(x, y) = aj(x, y + ly), the trace of 5 in [25] is taken
over discrete complete set instead of the continuous plane waves. thus the momentum integral

. in this case, (32) should be replaced by

jn = exp(2ien(lx)(ly)zlxly

in the following, we only concentrate on the innite space case since the conclusion on a torus
can be obtained by a trivial substitution. fortunately, we also have n(m) = n(m) for nite
chemical potential. thus we have immediately

which is quite dierent from the perturbative conclusion in [19]. (the formula eq(97) there is for
an arbitrary background).

now the low temperature limit can be obtained. it will depend on the relationship between m

and .

it vanishes in the high temperature limit. it is obvious that the low temperature is very sensitive
to the values of m and , as agrees with the results perturbatively obtained [19].

since in the large-m limit (or in the low-density limit), the parity-odd part dominantes over

 ln z(, ), we have

the eective action, and the particle number in the ensemble is < n >= 1

from the limits (38) and (41) that the ux should be quantized[27],

 =< n >

4h

e

(43)

which implies that each particle carries ux 4h
this is in accordance with the conclusion in [19].

e and thus should be of fractional spin s = 1
4.

the next thing is to evaluate det(/d + n). we have to calculate the eigenvalues of the operator

/d + n for this purpose, i.e. to solve the equation

(/d + n) = 

(44)

in general, it is impossible to solve it. so we conne ourselvs to the background (7). it is easily
seen that once the eigenvalues of /d are known, the eigenvalues  can be obtained. we thus consider
the problem

since

/d = a

/d2 = didi

[j, i][dj, di] = didi + eb3

the eigenvalues a can be obtained from the well-known relativistic landau levels[28].

with degeneracy |eb|

therefore, we have (we suppose eb > 0) for a unit area

another way to evaluate it is to make use of the relation

det(/d + n) = det[3(/d + n)3] = det(/d + n)

from which one can deduce that

the eigenvalue equation of /d2 + 2

n is

det(/d + n) = qdet(/d2 + 2

(didi  eb3 + 2

which is divergent. with this eective action, one can discuss the induced particle density and
the spin of the system. but the expressions are not as simple as in the non-relativistic case.

4 discussions

to conclude this paper, we make some discussions. for the background (7), the eective action
can also be computed as the zero temperature case in[19]. we here rst seperate  into a parity-
odd part and an even part. both calculations should be in accordance with each other. we know
that in general at zero temperature, the functional determinant can be expanded in terms of the
powers of 1

m[29]

 i ln det(i 6d  m) = wcs +

24m z d3xff  + o(

unfortunately, we can not make a direct comparison between (58) and (59) because of the sum

so the second term in (59) should correspond to the rst term of the expansion of ln(1 + x) of the
third term in (60). in the case  = a3 = 0, the sum over n can be accomplished using the formula



xn=

(2n + 1)2 + 2 =

(61)

but the sum over l is troublesome.

finally, we would like to mention that apart from the interests explained in the introduction,
there is another interest relevent to bosonization. if the fermion determinants can be calculated
exactly, we may employ the duality-transformation approach[30] to bosonize the fermion models
as in[31].
