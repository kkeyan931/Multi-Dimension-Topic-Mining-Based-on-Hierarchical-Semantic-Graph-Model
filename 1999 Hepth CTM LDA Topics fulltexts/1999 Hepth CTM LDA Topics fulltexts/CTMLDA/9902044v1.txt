abstract

we introduce a suitable adapted ordering for the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra
(i.e. with mixed boundary conditions for the fermionic elds). we show that the ordering
kernels for complete verma modules have two elements and the ordering kernels for g-closed
verma modules just one. therefore, spaces of singular vectors may be two-dimensional
for complete verma modules whilst for g-closed verma modules they can only be one-
dimensional. we give all singular vectors for the levels 1
2 for both complete
verma modules and g-closed verma modules. we also give explicit examples of degenerate
cases with two-dimensional singular vector spaces in complete verma modules. general
expressions are conjectured for the relevant terms of all (primitive) singular vectors, i.e. for
the coecients with respect to the ordering kernel. these expressions allow to identify all
degenerate cases as well as all g-closed singular vectors. they also lead to the discovery
of subsingular vectors for the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra. explicit examples of
these subsingular vectors are given for the levels 1
2 . finally, the multiplication
rules for singular vector operators are derived using the ordering kernel coecients. this
sets the basis for the analysis of the twisted n = 2 embedding diagrams.

singular dimensions of the n = 2 superconformal algebras ii:

introduction

the spectacular gain of importance of superstring theory in physics over the past fteen years
asked for solutions to challenging problems on the mathematics side. just like for any quantum
eld theory, a key problem is the study of the underlying symmetry algebra in order to under-
stand the space of states of the physical theory. almost at the same time as ademollo et al.1
identied for the rst time the symmetry algebras of the superstrings, kac was already studying
these objects among his classication of superalgebras24. these symmetry algebras are known
as superconformal algebras because the virasoro algebra is a subalgebra due to the conformal
invariance on the string world-sheet. the study of the representations of the superconformal
algebras is one of these challenging problems for mathematics. despite its importance, satisfac-
tory answers are still not known for most superconformal algebras. increasing the number of
fermionic currents n the structure of the representations of the superconformal algebras gets
more and more complicated. the case of the n = 1 superconformal algebra is well understood
thanks to many authors2, 6, 5, 18, 19, 23, 25, 27, 28, 30. however, its representation theory is very close
to the representation theory of the virasoro algebra. already for the n = 2 superconformal
algebras there are still many open questions, even though much progress has been made in
recent years8, 12, 11, 20, 21, 14. for the n = 2 superconformal algebras many aspects arise that are
new to representations of chiral algebras. one of these aspects is the existence of degenerate
singular vectors12, 21. that is, n = 2 superconformal verma modules can have at the same
level and with the same charge more than one linearly independent singular vectors. thus
the study of the embedding structure as well as the computation of character formulae for the
representations is much more complicated than in the case where the comparison of level and
charge is already enough in order to decide if two singular vectors are proportional, as it is for
the virasoro algebra and for the n = 1 superconformal algebra.

in physics, the dierent types of superconformal symmetry algebras, for the same number of
fermionic elds n , arise through the dierent choices of periodicity conditions for the fermionic
currents around a closed superstring world-sheet, as well as for dierent choices of the virasoro
generators (i.e. of the stress-energy tensor). for the standard choice of virasoro generators,
the superconformal algebras resulting from antiperiodic boundary conditions are called neveu-
schwarz algebras, those corresponding to periodic boundary conditions are called ramond
algebras and those with mixed boundary conditions are called twisted superconformal algebras.
the n = 2 superconformal algebras fall under four types: the neveu-schwarz n = 2 algebra,
the ramond n = 2 algebra, the topological n = 2 algebra, and the twisted n = 2 algebra.
the rst three algebras are isomorphic, nevertheless their highest weight representations are
quite dierenta. the topological n = 2 algebra, which is the symmetry algebra of topological
conformal ed theory, also plays an important role in string theories9, 22, 7. this algebra is also
known as the twisted topological n = 2 algebra because it can be obtained from the neveu-
schwarz n = 2 algebra by modifying the stress-energy tensor by adding the derivative of the
u(1) current, procedure known as topological twist.

we have studied the singular dimensions of the three isomorphic algebras in a recent
publication16, where we presented a formalism - the adapted ordering method - that allows us
to compute upper limits for the dimensions of singular subspaces simply by ordering the algebra
generators appropriately. if this order is chosen in a suitable way, then the computed upper
limits for these singular dimensions may actually be maxima. we applied this method directly
to the topological n = 2 algebra proving its usefullness, and then we deduced the maximal
singular dimensions corresponding to the neveu-schwarz and to the ramond n = 2 algebras.

so far, not much attention has been given to the twisted superconformal algebras, which
appear for n = 2 for the rst time. this is mainly due to the fact that eld theories with mixed
periodicity conditions have not been considered for string theories. in the n = 2 case there
is just one twisted algebra whilst for bigger n there are several possible ways of mixing the
periodicity conditions of the fermionic elds and thus dierent twisted superconformal algebras
can be found.
in this paper we will focus on the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra.
we will show that the method of adapted orderings can also be used for this algebra. for
the three isomorphic n = 2 algebras as well as for the virasoro algebra we saw16 that the
suitably chosen adapted ordering assigns a special role to the powers of the virasoro generator
l1. surprisingly enough, in the twisted n = 2 case this role is taken over for the rst time
by another generator. furthermore, we will see that the twisted n = 2 algebra requires its
two fermionic elds to be mixed rather than kept separate as for the other n = 2 algebras.
hence the twisted n = 2 algebra behaves very dierently from the other n = 2 algebras
with respect to the adapted ordering method. nevertheless, the method still works and we
can prove that the computed upper limits for the singular dimensions are actually maxima.
even though the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra contains two fermionic elds, at the
algebraic level it looks as if it really contains only one. furthermore the parameter space of
the conformal weights is just one-dimensional, unlike the corresponding parameter spaces for
the three isomorphic n = 2 algebras. for both reasons, one would have naively suggested that
the singular dimensions have to be less than or equal to 1. surprisingly enough we will show
that the maximal singular dimension is in fact 2. surely, these two-dimensional spaces are not
spanned by any tangent space of vanishing surfaces corresponding to singular vectors - as it is
the case for the three isomorphic n = 2 algebras - simply due to the fact that the parameter
space is only one-dimensional. the singular dimension 2 arises rather in a completely new
way due to the intersection of two dierent one-parameter families of singular vectors. this is
another reason for which the twisted n = 2 algebra is so far unique of its kind.

superconformal algebras seem to have many surprising features. not only does this paper
show that recent achievements follow the correct way to tackle these and to learn much, which
will be helpful to analyse even more complicated conformal structures, it also shows that the
twisted n = 2 algebra gives more new and dierent insight in superconformal representation
theory. furthermore this paper creates the basis for the study of the embedding structure of
the twisted n = 2 highest weight representations since we deduce the singular dimensions as
well as the multiplication rules for singular vector operators. both are crucial for the analysis
of the embedding structure. we will also give answers to the question whether the twisted
n = 2 superconformal algebra contains subsingular vectors. the study of the embedding
diagrams, that is the structure of descendant (secondary) singular vectors, will be considered
in a forthcoming publication.

this paper is organised in the following way. after a small introduction with the necessary
facts about the twisted n = 2 algebra in section 2, we review the concept of adapted orderings
and its main implications in section 3, in a version suitable for the twisted n = 2 algebra.
in section 4 we then introduce an adapted ordering for the verma modules of the twisted
n = 2 algebra. this allows us to compute the upper limits for the singular dimensions and
the multiplication rules for singular vector operators in section 5. that these upper limits
are in fact maximal dimensions is demonstrated in section 6 using explicit examples which are
supplemented by more examples in appendix a. based on both theoretical results and explicit
computational results we give a reliable conjecture for the coecients of the relevant terms of all
twisted n = 2 singular vectors in section 7. using this conjecture we can characterize all cases
of degenerate (i.e. two-dimensional) singular vectors for all levels. this conjecture leads to the
discovery of subsingular vectors, which are singular in the g-closed verma modules considered

in section 8 and in appendix b. it also leads to the identication of all g-closed singular vectors,
which are the issue of section 9. we conclude the paper with some nal remarks in section 10.

2 the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra

the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra j2 consists of the virasoro algebra generatorsb lm,
m  z, corresponding to the stress-energy tensor, a heisenberg algebra tr, with half-integral
, corresponding to the u(1) current, and the fermionic generators gk, k  z1/2, which are
r  z 1

the modes of the two spin-3/2 fermionic elds. j2 satises the following commutation relationsc.

for k  z 1
2
and topological n = 2 algebras one usually chooses a basis in which the odd generators are
nilpotent. if we want to keep the l0-grading of the basis for the algebra generators then such a
choice does not exist for the twisted n = 2 algebra. nevertheless, the squares of the fermionic
operators can be expressed in terms of virasoro operators, as one can deduce easily from the
commutation relations eqs. (1) :

the central term c commutes with all other operators and can therefore be xed as c  c.
hj2 = span{l0, c} denes a commuting subalgebra of j2, which can therefore be diagonalised
simultaneously. generators with positive index span the set of positive operators j+
2 of j2 and
likewise generators with negative index span the set of negative operators j

cthe earlier way of writing the twisted n = 2 commutation relations, as for instance given by
boucher, friedan, and kent8, is to distinguish the modes of the two fermionic elds explicitly using
superscripts 1 and 2. however, algebraically it is not necessary to distinguish them as one of the elds
has modes with integral indices and the other one has modes with half-integral indices. in order to avoid
the imaginary unit i appearing in the commutation relations, we have, for convenience, redened igr as
gr for r  z 1

compared to the notation in ref. 8.

the zero modes are spanned by j0
2 = span{l0, g0, c} such that the generator g0 classies the
dierent types of verma modules as we will analyse shortly. one usually extends the algebra by
the parity operatord (1)f which commutes with all operators lm, tr, and c and anticommutes
with gk:

[(1)f , lm] = [(1)f , tr] = [(1)f , c] = 0 , m  z , r  z 1

2

,

{(1)f , gk} = 0 , k  z1/2 .

the operator (1)f will serve us later to distinguish fermionic from bosonic states in the space
of states. as (1)f commutes with hj2 it can also be diagonalised simultaneously to hj2.

as usual, a simultaneous eigenvector |i of hj2 and (1)f with l0-eigenvalue  (the
conformal weight), c-eigenvaluee c (the conformal anomaly), and vanishing j+
2 action is called
a highest weight vector, corresponding in fact to the state with lowest conformal weight in a given
representation of the algebra. unless otherwise stated, we set |i to have (1)f -eigenvaluef
(parity) +. additional zero-mode vanishing conditions are possible only with respect to the
operator g0 which may or may not annihilate a highest weight vector |i (c.f. ref. 16,
denition 3.a). if g0 annihilates the highest weight vector we shall denote it by a superscript
in |ig and call this highest weight vector g-closed. since g2
24 , any g-closed vector
necessarily has conformal weight  = c
24 . verma modules are dened in the usual way as the
left module obtained by acting with the universal enveloping algebra u (j2) on a highest weight
vector:

and |p
l of a verma module v are eigenvectors of hj2 with parity
 that are not proportional to the highest weight vector but are annihilated by j+

correspond therefore to the states with lowest conformal weight in a given subrepresentation
of the algebra. they may also satisfy an additional vanishing condition with respect to the
operator g0 in which case we add a superscript g in the notation g
and call it a g-
closed singular vector. obviously g-closed singular vectors satisfy similar restrictions on their
conformal weight as g-closed highest weight vectors:  + l = c
24 . most singular vectors can be
constructed by acting with algebra generators on another singular vector at a lower (or equal)
level. these are called secondary singular vectors. otherwise, they are called primitive singular
vectors. the singular vector operator

singular vectors and all their descendant vectors (i.e. all the states that are produced by
acting with algebra generators on the singular vectors) have vanishing (pseudo-)norms under the
standard inner product. vectors with zero norm are usually called null vectorsg. the quotient

gstrictly speaking, null-vectors should only be vectors in the kernel of the inner product matrix and
hence decouple completely from the whole space of states. if the pseudo-norm is not positive semi-denite
there may be vectors with vanishing pseudo-norm that are not null-vectors15.

singular dimensions of the n = 2 superconformal algebras ii:

module where all null vectors are set to 0 is hence an irreducible highest weight representation.
conversely, all irreducible highest weight representations can be constructed in this way. how-
ever, singular vectors and their descendants do not necessarily span the whole submodule of
null vectors. the quotient module of the verma module divided by the submodule spanned by
all singular vectors may again contain new singular vectors, called subsingular vectors. subsin-
gular vectors and their descendants are also null vectors. subsingular vectors do not appear for
the virasoro algebra neither for the n = 1 superconformal algebras. however, they have been
discovered for the three isomorphic n = 2 superconformal algebras in refs. 21, 20. in these
cases, the existence of subsingular vectors is very closely related to the existence of singular
operators annihilating a singular vector as shall be discussed in a forthcoming publication15.
that the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra also has subsingular vectors will be shown in
section 8. of this paper.

even though the set of null vectors consists of singular vectors, subsingular vectors, and all
their descendants, the null vectors with lowest level in a verma module are certainly singular
vectors (i.e. annihilated by all the positive operators). therefore, the lowest level at which
the determinant of the inner product matrix vanishes indicates the presence of (at least) one
singular vector. hence the determinant formula is one of the most important tools for analysing
highest weight representations. for the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra the determinant
formula has been given by boucher, friedan, and kent8. for level zero the determinant formulae
are detm +
24 . for level l  n1/2 and parity  the determinant formulae
are:

where r and s are positive integers (s odd). the partition function p (l), that can be found
in ref. 8, satises p (0) = 1. the two parity sectors  have exactly the same determinant
expressions. this correspondence is in fact even closer since the operator g0 interpolates
between the two sectors, provided g0 does not act on any g-closed vector. let us analyse this
correspondence closer for singular vectors.

one might therefore believe that singular vectors always come in groups of (at least) 4. however,
this assumes that these 4 vectors are actually linearly independent, what is not true as one can
guess from the fact that p (0) = 1 in the determinant formulae, pointing towards the existence
of, generically, one singular vector of each parity at the same level in the same verma module.
this issue will be considered in section 7. in the case of g-closed verma modules or g-closed
singular vectors some of these vectors are actually trivial, an issue that is important for the
discussion of embedding diagrams.

for elements y of j2 which are eigenvectors of hj2 and (1)f with respect to the adjoint
representation we dene the level |y |l as [l0, y ] = |y |ly and in addition the parity |y |f as
[(1)f , y ] = |y |f y . in particular, elements of the form

ky k = l + t + g. for the trivial case we set |1|l = k1k = 0 and |1|f = +1. for convenience
we dene the following sets of negative operators for l  n1/2

3 adapted orderings and singular dimensions

a key question for the theory of highest weight representations is the dimension of any space of
1/2
singular vectors that may appear at a given level l  n
0 with xed parity p  {} in a verma
module v. in ref. 16 we have shown that these dimensions, called singular dimensions, are
closely related to the ordering kernel of an adapted ordering on the set cp
l . in fact, it is the
number of elements of the ordering kernel that sets an upper limit on the singular dimensions of
a verma module. before we introduce an adapted ordering o on c
l and compute its ordering
kernel as dened in ref. 16, we shall rst review a few results on adapted orderings that are
crucial for our reasoning. an adapted ordering is simply a one-sided bounded total ordering on
cp
l satisfying the requirements specied in the following denition.

our aim is to introduce an adapted ordering on cp

l such that the resulting ordering kernels
are as small as possible. there are two main reasons to proceed in this way. first, for a given
singular vector p
l of v the coecients of the terms corresponding to the ordering kernel cpk
determine the singular vector uniquely, i.e.
if the normal forms of two singular vectors agree
on the ordering kernel then the singular vectors are identical. this also implies that for a given
singular vector p
l at least one element of the adapted kernel must be a non-trivial term of
l , otherwise p
p
l would agree on the whole adapted kernel with the trivial vector and would
therefore be trivial itself. secondly, the number of elements in the ordering kernel cpk
is an
upper limit for the singular dimensions of v at level l, parity p. these results are the content
of two theorems which we proved in a very general setting in ref. 16. due to their importance
for our later considerations we repeat these theorems here adapted to the particular case of the
twisted n = 2 algebra j2.

4 adapted ordering for the twisted n = 2 algebra

in this section we will dene an adapted ordering on cp
l , given by eq. (18), and compute its
ordering kernel which will later turn out to be the smallest possible ordering kernel. we will
conclude this section by transferring these results to the g-closed case cpg
. for convenience,
we shall rst give an ordering on the sets lm, ts, and gk.

denition 4.a let y denote either l, t, or g, (but the same throughout this denition) and
take two elements yi, i = 1, 2, such that yi = z i
, or
yi = 1, i = 1, 2, with z i
depending on
whether y denotes l, t, or g respectively. for y1 6= y2 we compute the indexi j0 = min{j :

for the proof of theorem 4.c we follow the lines of the proof for the topological n = 2
algebra given in ref. 16. there, however, our strategy for the proof was to nd annihilation
operators that were able to produce an additional operator l1 which would create a term that
cannot be obtained by any o-bigger term. obviously, in our present case t 1
has taken over
the role that was played by l1 in the topological n = 2 case. (as a matter of fact this is the
rst time that this role is played by a generator dierent from l1). the following proof makes
clear that in this case the adapted ordering method works for powers of t 1

is irrelevant for us in view of denition 3.a on adapted orderings. the action of one positive
operator can however create at most one new generator. we can therefore restrict ourselves to
terms y of the form

than x0. if gk1 1

1 = 1 to create t 1

could only be created in three ways. first, gk1 1

creates x g acting on y , then the
with the same number n of generators t 1
additional t 1
commutes with generators
in gy and creates t 1
commutes with generators in ly t y and creates gk
with k < k1 which furthermore commutes with generators in gy to create t 1
. third, gk1 1
2
commutes with generators in ly t y gy and creates g0 which then commutes with g 1
in the
case of ry
1 = 1 would obviously lead to y being
o-smaller than x0 because then r1 = 0 (as x g is the term produced from y in this way), and
due to eq. (31). in the rst and second cases we obviously need to have a generator gk in
gy with 1
commutes only with this
generator. in the latter case x0 would consequently equal y and in the former case y is again
o-smaller than x0 according to eq. (32). hence, we have shown that the ordering o is adapted
on the set of terms x0 of the form eq. (35) with g0 6= 1.
let us therefore continue with terms x0 of the form

2 < k < k1, or gk1 itself is contained in gy and gk1 1

y <o x0. we can hence concentrate on terms y of the form

in one
step by commuting with lm1 if this is contained in ly . in this case, however, y turns out
in more than one step by
to be equal to x0. another possibility is that tm1 1
commuting with generators in ly which obviously requires ly to contain generators lm with
1  m < m1 and therefore y <o x0 due to eq. (33). we therefore have shown that the ordering

with generators in t y . exactly the same arguments as for ly
of ls1 1
together with eq. (34) show that either y = x0 or y <o x0. hence, the ordering o is adapted
on the set of terms x0 of the form eq. (35) with g0 6= 1 or l0 6= 1 or t 0 6= 1. this already
proves the ordering kernels of table tab. a.

to conclude this subsection we mention that we can easily transfer these results to g-
closed verma modules. it is fairly straightforward to see that the above proof also holds if we
set everywhere r2  0. this however leads exactly to the g-closed case. therefore, the same
ordering o of denition 4.b will also serve as ordering og on cpg
in the case of a g-closed
verma module v g

the ordering kernels. one easily nds the following theorem.

5 singular dimensions and singular vectors of the twisted n = 2

algebra

as a consequence of the results of the previous section we will now be able to give an upper limit
1/2
for the dimensions of a singular vector space at a given level l  n
0 with xed parity p  {}.
in addition, we will use the ordering kernels in order to uniquely identify all singular vectors
(primitive as well as secondary) of the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra. in section 6 we
shall give explicit examples which prove that for particular verma modules the upper limits are
indeed the maximal singular dimensions.

theorem 3.c tells us that an upper limit for the dimension of a space of singular vectors
at xed level l and parity p is given by the number of elements in the corresponding ordering
kernel cpk
. using the tables of ordering kernels of theorem 4.c and theorem 4.d we can easily
give the following maximal singular dimensions.

tab. d maximal dimensions for singular spaces of the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra.

surely, not at each level the singular spaces will have the dimensions given in the previous
tables. in fact, for most levels in most verma modules there will not be any singular vectors
at all. the determinant formulae of the inner product matrix8, given in section 2, indicate in
which verma modules and at which levels singular vectors appear (for the rst time). in the
following section we shall give examples of these singular vectors for low levels. from theorem
3.b we know that singular vectors can only exist if they contain in their normal form at least
one non-trivial term of the corresponding ordering kernel of theorem 4.c or 4.d. furthermore,
if the normal forms of two singular vectors agree in the coecients of the terms of the ordering
kernel, then the singular vectors are identical. this allows us to identify existing singular vectors
simply by their coecients with respect to the terms of the ordering kernel. for the cases of
tab. d with singular dimension 1 this implies that two singular vectors are already proven to

the twisted n = 2 algebra

15

be proportional if we can simply show that they are on the same level with the same parity. in
addition, if the coecient of the term of the ordering kernel vanishes, then the singular vector
is trivial. thus, the coecient of t 2l
is already sucient in order to see if a singular vector is
 1
2
trivial, in the case of p = + (see tables tab. b and tab. c), whereas the coecient of t 2l

or t 2l1
when the ordering kernel is two-dimensional we need the coecients of the two terms in order
to uniquely dene a singular vector. this justies to introduce an appropriate notation, as

6 level 1/2, level 1, and level 3/2 singular vectors.

before we proceed in analysing the structure of the singular vectors we shall rst give all singular
vectors at the lower levels 1/2, 1 and 3/2. these examples already prove that the upper limits
given for the singular dimensions are in fact not only upper limits but actually maximal singular
dimensions for certain verma modules. the determinant formulae8, given in section 2, show
the existence of the parity  singular vector 
, and also
show the existence of the singular vectors 
2 with parity , r, s  n, s odd, in the
verma modules vr,s(t) with:

these singular vectors

two or more of them in the same verma module, some of these singular vectors are actually
secondary.

by explicit computer calculations29 one nds the following singular vectors (one-parameter
families of singular vectors, to be precise) for parity +. the corresponding results for parity

we should note that at least at these levels there are no other singular vectors than the
ones predicted by the determinant formula. in principle, the determinant formula only proves
the existence of the singular vector at lowest level in a verma module given by eq. (59).
continuation arguments extend the existence to the cases where the curves of eq. (59) intersect.
the determinant formula does a priori not exclude the existence of so-called isolated singular
vectors which are primitive singular vectors that may appear at higher levels and are always
hidden behind a singular vector of type 
r,s. as far as we know, such isolated singular vectors
have never been found for any chiral algebra.

as these examples are the complete set of singular vectors at levels 1

2 with positive

we should stress that in the virasoro case for a given level l  n0 we also have dierent
one-parameter families of singular vectors p,q(t) that intersect for certain values of t. however,
for virasoro verma modules these singular vectors at such intersection points are always linearly

dependent. this follows indirectly from the proof of feigin and fuchs17 and directly from the
results of kent26 (see also our results in ref. 16). the same happens for the verma modules
of the n = 1 superconformal algebras. the degeneracy found for the neveu-schwarz n = 2
algebra12 (and for the topological and ramond n = 2 algebras16, 21) is dierent in the sense
that one single uncharged vector n s
r,s may on its own describe a two-dimensional space under
certain conditions (+1 and 1 charged singular vectors intersecting in the same verma module
and the uncharged singular vector becoming a secondary singular vector of them). at these
points t = t0 , n s
r,s (t0) vanishes and the two-dimensional tangent space becomes a degenerate
singular space. the degeneracy found for the twisted n = 2 algebra is thus of a dierent
type since the singular vectors that intersect are generically primitive, like the vectors +
3,1(1)
and +
it is in fact unique of its kind in the
sense that it has not been observed for any other chiral algebra so far in this form.
in the
following section we will conjecture general expressions for the twisted n = 2 singular vectors

r,s(t) (for the relevant coecients of the terms corresponding to the ordering kernel) based
on explicit examples and also theoretical arguments. from these expressions one deduces that
the parametrised vectors 
r,s(t) never vanish identically unlike the uncharged singular vectors
of the neveu-schwarz n = 2 algebra at the degenerate points.

we have learned in section 2 that every positive parity singular vector +
r,s, corresponding to an
operator (a, b)+
l , implies the existence of two singular vectors with negative parity at the same
level l, corresponding to the operators g(a, b)
r,s).
these two negative (or positive) parity singular vectors may or may not be linearly independent.
if they were always linearly independent, then whenever a singular vector exists we would nd
a two-dimensional singular space with the opposite parity. however, as was pointed out, the
fact that p (0) = 1 in the determinant formula, given by eq. (7), points towards the existence
of, generically, one singular vector of each parity at the same level in the same verma module
vr,s. nevertheless, as we will see , even in the case where g(a, b)
l and
(a, b)+
g,l) are proportional the maximal singular dimension may still be 2. in order to analyse
this case in more detail we will use the expressions given by eqs. (55)-(58) for g(a, b)

requiring that the two negative parity singular vectors are proportional, and using the

4 s
rt+s . note that under the proportionality assumption, the case a = 0 also implies b = 0 and
thus (a, b)+
l  0, which we want to exclude. therefore, if either of the two conditions on the
ratio b
a is satised, then the two negative parity singular vectors derived from a positive parity
singular vector would be proportional and thus the corresponding singular dimension may well
only be 1. surprisingly enough, all examples found so far satisfy always the rst of these two
conditions. these examples include the singular vectors at levels 1
2 given in section
6 as well as singular vectors at levels 2 and 5
2 . we believe that there must be a deep reason
behind this result, i.e. underlying the fact that all the singular vectors we have computed
satisfy the same condition (out of two possible ones) that prevents a positive parity singular
vector to impose the existence of a two-dimensional singular space of negative parity. for this
reason we conjecture that the positive parity singular vectors +
|r,si follow the
ratio b
a for the negative
parity singular vectors 
|r,si. these results allow us to conjecture the following
expressions for the twisted n = 2 singular vectors.

will be considered in the following sections.

using the superconformal fusion rules it may be possible to derive explicit expressions for
all the coecients of the singular vectors eqs. (69)-(70) in the spirit of bauer, di francesco,
itzykson, and zuber4, 3, as it was possible for the neveu-schwarz n = 2 case10. this could also
lead to a proof of conjecture 7.a. for this purpose it would be necessary to develop15 rst a
twisted supereld formalism following the approach of ref. 13 for the neveu-schwarz algebras.

based on conjecture 7.a it is easy to compute the verma modules with degenerate singular
vectors, i.e. with singular spaces of dimension 2. for a given level l  n
there are normally
multiple solutions to the number theoretical problem rs = 2l, r, s  n, s odd. it happens the
rst time for level l = 3
2 that we nd multiple solutions r = 1, s = 3 and r = 3, s = 1. in the
general case one factorises the integer 2l in its prime factors

level l = 630 we nd the prime factorisation 2l = 22  32  5  7. hence, we nd 12 3-tuples
0 with k1  2 and k2, k3  1. we should note that for each level l  n1/2 there
(k1, k2, k3)  n3
exists at least one solution: r = 2l, s = 1. the number of solutions to rs = 2l, r, s  n, s odd is
thus determined by the number of p -tuples  = (k1, . . . , kp ) with   np
0 and   (n1, . . . , np )

for the prime factorisation of 2l. hence, there arek l = qp

due to our conjecture 7.a we have generically only one-dimensional singular spaces dened
by the singular vectors +
2 for all l solutions of r and s. that is,
these singular vectors with the same parity and level are located in dierent verma modules.
the most interesting verma modules are those, where some of these l solutions intersect and
may hence lead to two-dimensional singular spaces provided the corresponding singular vectors
are not proportional. using conjecture 7.a we shall now investigate such cases of degeneration.
let us note again that the singular dimension can not be bigger than 2 even though a priori we
would expect that even more than 2 solutions i could intersect.

singular dimensions of the n = 2 superconformal algebras ii:

let us analyse the intersections of the conformal weights r,s(t) of the l solutions to
rs = 2l, r, s  n, s odd. for xed l  n1/2 we nd the prime factorisation as given above.
let us now take two p -tuples 1 and 2 (1 6= 2) and let us assume that the corresponding
conformal weights intersect: r1 ,s1 = r2 ,s2 . applying eq. (59) one gets straightforwardly

the conformal weights r1 ,s1 and r2 ,s2 have exactly 2 intersection points, namely t =

r2 ,s2 both exist. the key
question will now be whether these singular vectors are actually dierent and hence dene a
two-dimensional singular space, or if they are proportional and thus lead to a one-dimensional
singular space instead.

and 2 the corresponding singular vectors are always linearly independent at the intersection
points (i.e.
in the same verma module). therefore, since for high levels l there are many
dierent p -tuples, the question arises whether or not it is possible that the conformal weights
of more than two p -tuples can intersect at the same value t, obtaining a contradiction to either
of our results. that this is not the case is shown in the following consideration. the conformal
weights of 1 and 2 (1 6= 2) intersect at t =  1
in the same way the

conjecture 7.a which seems to be a very reliable conjecture. we summarise our results in the
following theorem.

2 the singular vectors 

theorem 7.b let us x a level l  n1/2. based on the conjecture 7.a one nds that at the
level l = rs
r,s dene generically one-dimensional singular spaces. the
only exceptions, where degenerate singular spaces of dimension 2 arise, occur necessarily for the
cases when two conformal weights r1,s1(t) and r2,s2(t) intersect. for each two dierent pairs
(r1, s1) and (r2, s2) with l = r1s1
2 , r1, r2, s1, s2  n, s1, s2 odd, there are two values of t
where such an intersection happens. these values are t =  1
and they are real
and rational in all cases. however, the conformal weights of three such pairs do not intersect
for any common values of t.

in v g
is twofold. first, for physical applications it could be relevant if a highest weight
vector (or a singular vector) is g-closed, which makes v g
special compared to other quotient
spaces. secondly, the verma module v c
is easier to construct by explicit calculations than
24
most verma modules with singular vectors. nevertheless, we aim also at obtaining information
on the structure of quotient modules that is valid not only for v g
but also for quotient modules
of similar type.

20, 21 for the neveu-schwarz, the ramond, and the topological n = 2 algebras. so far, nothing
was known about the existence of subsingular vectors in the twisted n = 2 case. due to the
very dierent structure of this particular n = 2 algebra it was hard to say what one a priori
should expect. however, we will show in this section that the twisted n = 2 superconformal

they ever appeared for any other chiral algebra.

the twisted n = 2 algebra

by explicit computation one easily nds that singular vectors 

r,s do appear in v g

rs
8r

2 where the singular vectors 

exactly the levels rs
r,s disappear in the quotient kernel. (the
reasons for this will will be shown in a future publication15). in addition these are the only
singular vectors appearing in v g
r,s are hence subsingular vectors in the complete
verma modules v rs

we conclude this section with another interesting fact about the g-closed verma modules.
as we know, the singular dimension for g-closed verma modules is only 1. one may wonder
what happens in the cases where v c
has a two-dimensional singular space. first of all, we have
24
just shown that if this happens then - due to the nature of the singular vectors 
r,s - the whole
two-dimensional singular space would vanish in the quotient space v g
as it is descendant of

0 . nevertheless, one could argue that for these cases the corresponding subsingular vectors
that appear in a one to one correspondence at the same levels than the singular vectors that
disappear, may span a two-dimensional subsingular space. however, verma modules v that
contain degenerate singular vectors never satisfy  = c
24 and therefore this question is redun-
dant. namely, if we use in t =  s
r the expressions of eqs. (72) for r and s and require that
t =  1
in the case of degeneracy for two p -tuples 1 and 2, one easily nds

taking into account that the pi are distinct primes then the only solution to eq. (83) is, however,
1 = 2, which shows that the modules v with  = c
24 never have two-dimensional singular
spaces.

9 g-closed singular vectors.

in this last section we will analyse g-closed singular vectors in a very similar way as we have
analysed g-closed verma modules in the previous section. due to the constraints on the confor-
mal weights, there are no g-closed singular vectors in g-closed verma modules, as mentioned
already earlier. therefore, we take 
r,s(t)  vr,s(t) and impose the conformal weight constraint
r,s + rs

the unique solution

24 which is satised by g-closed singular vectors. the condition r,s + rs

according to the result that the singular dimension for g-closed singular vectors is 1, the

ordering kernel being given in table tab. b, a g-closed singular vector g

again, the only solution to eq. (85) is 1 = 2, in contradiction with the assumption that
1 and 2 are distinct. this shows that the degenerate cases do not correspond to g-closed
singular vectors, i.e. two-dimensional singular spaces are never g-closed.

10 conclusions and prospects

in this paper we have applied the method of adapted orderings to the twisted n = 2 super-
conformal algebra. this shows, again, that this method is a powerful tool that can easily be
applied to a large classes of algebras. the way it works is rather simple and it is very exible in
its use. whereas the application of this method to the topological, neveu-schwarz and ramond
n = 2 algebras in ref. 16 assigned a special role to the virasoro generator l1, for the twisted
. another
n = 2 algebra this special role has been taken over by the u(1) current generator t 1
remarkable dierence compared to our earlier applications of this method is that in the twisted
n = 2 case the fermionic eld modes need to be mixed in the adapted ordering rather than
being kept separate.

2

as a result we have derived the singular dimensions and the ordering kernels for the twisted
n = 2 algebra. this reveals that also the twisted n = 2 algebra contains degenerate singular
spaces with dimension 2 in complete verma modules, as it is the case for the three isomorphic
n = 2 algebras. on the other hand, g-closed verma modules have singular dimension 1 and
therefore do not allow any degenerate singular spaces.

based on the ordering kernel coecients we have conjectured general expressions for the
relevant terms of all (primitive) singular vectors. these expressions lead to the identication
of all degenerate cases with singular dimension 2 and also to the identication of all g-closed
singular vectors. these expressions also lead to the discovery of subsingular vectors for the
twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra. as in many examples for the other n = 2 supercon-
formal algebras, these subsingular vectors appear in relation to additional vanishing conditions
on a singular vector. this relation can be generally proven and will be given in a forthcoming
paper15. we have seen that ordering kernel coecients play a crucial role in this matter.

the twisted n = 2 algebra

25

we have also computed multiplication rules for singular vector operators, which sets the
foundation for the study of the twisted n = 2 embedding diagrams which will be investigated
in a future publication.

the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra has hence proven to have a rather rich struc-
ture that contains many features that were also discovered for the three isomorphic n = 2
superconformal algebras. nevertheless, the way these features appear in the case of the twisted
n = 2 algebra is quite dierent from the way they appear for the other n = 2 algebras. for
example, the degenerate singular spaces are produced simply by the intersection of two primi-
tive singular vectors. for no other n = 2 algebra primitive singular vectors at the same level
and with the same charge are linearly independent. furthermore, the discovery of degenerate
singular vectors in the twisted n = 2 case is rather surprising as the underlying parameter
space is just one-dimensional. the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra hence turns out
to be quite distinct from all other superconformal algebras analysed so far in the literature.
this raises the need for the analysis of twisted superconformal algebras for higher n - a very
interesting question already because the periodicity conditions of more than 2 fermionic elds
can be mixed in dierent ways. the concept of adapted orderings should apply also in these
cases.
