introduction

thermodynamics is a useful tool in analyzing the characteristic prop-
erties of a system of many degrees of freedom. the equation of state
gives the density of states, as well as clues to the eective degrees of free-
dom and their interactions, at the characteristic energy scale set by the
temperature. these lectures will try to convey the idea that brane ther-
modynamics is a useful way of organizing much of what we know about
the duality between quantum gravity and nongravitational theories (of-
ten gauge eld theories) which generalizes the ads/cft correspondence
(see [1] for a review).

we will restrict our considerations to systems with maximal super-
symmetry compactied on tori; this seemingly simple arena already en-
compasses a rich variety of phenomena.
in section two, the relation
between brane dynamics and black holes is reviewed, beginning with
the correspondence principle [2] governing the transition between black
holes and objects in perturbative string theory. brane subsystems are
isolated by the (maldacena) scaling limit [3] that decouples their dynam-
ics from the ambient spacetime; the uv/ir relation [4] between energy
scales in the brane and gravity descriptions is illustrated in the context
of the thermodynamics. criteria are established governing the validity
of various eective descriptions of the thermodynamics of the system. in
sections three and four, the application of these criteria are illustrated
via a set of increasingly sophisticated examples. section ve concludes
with a few closing remarks.

more details may be found in [5][6][7][8]; these articles were written
from the perspective of matrix theory [9] (see [10] for a review), which
arises as the universal low-entropy phase of dp-brane dynamics on tori.
the present lectures adopt a somewhat more mainstream viewpoint,
adhering more closely to a description in terms of the gauge theory dy-
namics appearing at high entropy. the phase structure at high entropy,
insensitive to the spatial boundary conditions, was rst studied in [11],
[12].

branes and black holes

at weak coupling, the dynamics of n dp-branes in type ii string
theory is governed by open string perturbation theory. the generic
state is a gas of open strings; the low-energy modes are those of p + 1-

geometry is an example of the correspondence principle of horowitz-
polchinski [2], which states that a black hole becomes a perturbative
string state at suciently weak coupling.

one can sharpen the picture considerably by scaling away the asymp-

totically at region, following maldacena [3]:

this limit decouples string oscillator modes, whose energy typically
scales as 1/s. since the ten-dimensional gravitational coupling is g10 
ym = gsp3
s 8
g2
,
the closed string dynamics away from the brane source decouples (i.e.
g10  0) for p < 7 (g10  const. for p = 7). one also encoun-
ters situations described by m-theory; here, the relevant gravitational
coupling is the eleven-dimensional newton constant g11  g3
s 9
s, which
scales away for p < 6 and approaches a constant for p = 6, in the limit
(1.12). even though the dynamics becomes trivial far from the branes,
one presumes that close enough to the source, the scaling away of the
gravitational coupling is compensated by large eld strengths. malda-
cena conjectured that in a region of overlap, quantum gravity is dened
by the strongly coupled dynamics of branes; conversely, geometry gives
an eective description of the brane dynamics.

an interesting feature of this relation between geometry and brane dy-
namics is a correspondence between increasing distance from the horizon
in the geometry, and high energies in the brane dynamics  the uv/ir
correspondence [4][14]. this property is readily seen in the thermody-
namics, where the hawking temperature t  e/s of the black geometry
is

(1.13)

higher temperature (the uv of the brane dynamics) is associated to
larger horizon radius (the ir in gravity), up to p = 5.3 the uv/ir
correspondence is related to the positive specic heat of dp-brane black
holes up to p = 5. the well-controlled uv structure of the brane dy-
namics then provides an ir regulator for gravity (it implicitly prescribes
an asymptotic boundary condition on the geometry), while the wilso-
nian renormalization group guarantees a well-behaved uv structure for
gravity. this proposal begins to break down for p = 5, where the brane
ymn )1/2 known as
dynamics exhibits a limiting temperature t  (g2

3note that this is the same as the uv/ir relation obtained in [14] from the scaling of the
wave equation in the near-horizon geometry.

the hagedorn temperature. such behavior is characteristic of string dy-
namics, and so it has been proposed [15][16][17] that there is a (strongly
coupled) string theory decoupled from gravity which governs the dynam-
ics of vebranes. going a bit further, for p = 6 the system has negative
specic heat  bulk gravity is not decoupled, as we saw above; there is
no ir regulator, and arbitrarily many light states couple at longer and
longer wavelengths when we pump energy in to increase the horizon size.
to summarize, in regions of strong eective coupling, the thermo-
dynamics of maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory is described
by/describes black geometries. the thermodynamics of black geometry
is entirely governed by the geometry at the horizon; thus we can try to
map out a phase diagram using whatever low-energy description is ap-
propriate for the horizon geometry in a given strongly-coupled regime,
and matching onto perturbative domains at correspondence points.

to implement this strategy, we should examine the constraints on the

validity of a low-energy geometrical description:

(1) the curvature at the horizon should be less than the string scale.
this is the horowitz-polchinski correspondence principle. if this
condition is not satised, the appropriate description is a gas of
perturbative strings (in the presence of the background d-branes).

(2) the string coupling at the horizon should be less than unity. if

this condition is not satised, then one either

(a) lifts to m-theory in a iia string description; this repackages
the string metric, dilaton, and rr one-form into an eleven-
dimensional metric:

ds2

11 = e2/3ds2

10 + e4/3(dx11 + cdx)2 .

(1.14)

d0-branes carry momentum in the eleventh dimension; strings
are membranes wrapped around x11; and so on.

(b) performs an s-duality transformation in a iib description:

,

s

gs  1/gs

(g10  g10) .
   ,
(1.15)
in particular, perturbative strings are interchanged with d1-
branes, and d3-branes are invariant due to the s-duality sym-
metry of 3+1 n = 4 sym.

s  gs2

(3) cycle sizes should be greater than the string scale:

iqgii(r0) > s .

(1.16)

where the sums and products are over all aected cycles, and
we have assumed a rectangular torus. t-duality [18] exchanges
momenta on the aected cycles with perturbative string winding,
and mixes the various dp-branes [19][20]. for example, dp-branes
wrapping t p are exchanged with d0-branes on the dual torus t p.

higher-dimensional torus.

the black hole lls that compact dimension; if not, it is entropically
favorable for the horizon to localize on that cycle (see figure 1.3).
this instability to topology change of the horizon was rst studied
by gregory and laamme [21].

figure 1.4 gregory-laamme localization transition for a boosted horizon

in the metric pass from being independent of x11 to being periodic
in x11.

to the level of approximation considered here, all equations of state are
scaling relations of the form

e  const.  san bv 3c ,

(1.20)

where

v 3  g2

(1.21)
is the eective coupling.4 furthermore, the free energy f, energy e,
and t s all scale the same way. thus, to nd the boundaries between
dierent phases, we may equate the dimensionless energies (e)phase1 =
(e)phase2; then the phase boundary occurs at

ym3p

(1.22)

in the large n limit. consequently, it is convenient to plot the phase
diagram as a function of ( log s

log n ) versus ( log v

log n ).

some remarks are appropriate at this point on what is meant in these
lectures by the terms phase and phase transition. for the present
purpose, we distinguish thermodynamic phases by the scaling of their
equations of state. at nite brane charge n and in nite volume, there

4the choice of v as the inverse one-third power of the dimensionless gauge coupling is
motivated by the fact that v is the size of the dual torus t p (in 11d planck units) seen by
d0-branes in low-entropy phases.

cannot be any true phase transitions, since the number of available de-
grees of freedom will be nite; rather one has a crossover between limiting
behaviors. in some cases, the transition is a true phase transition in the
classical limit n  . an example is the gregory-laamme transi-
tion discussed above; in [21] it was found that the classical equations of
motion develop an unstable mode as one enters the regime (1.18), the
hallmark of a second-order phase transition.
in other examples, such
as the horowitz-polchinski correspondence transition, it is not known
whether the classical limit develops a singularity; classical black holes
might or might not smoothly evolve into perturbative classical string
states. the dynamics of such transitions has been studied in [22][23];
the details are dimension-dependent.

dp-brane examples

warm-up exercise: do-branes

consider rst the example of d0-branes. here there is no compacti-
cation scale  since all spatial dimensions are noncompact (apart from
the m-circle). the yang-mills coupling gym sets the only scale; and the
phase plot is one-dimensional, since phase boundaries are set by a con-
dition of the form ( log s
log n ) = . from (1.10), the horowitz-polchinski
correspondence point for p = 0 is s  n 2, at which r0/pl  n 1/3.5
for s > n 2, the horizon radius in planck units is larger than n 1/3;
and from (1.13) we see that the hawking temperature is more than
the energy r0/2
s required to stretch a string across the horizon scale
r0, indicating that the d0-brane quantum mechanics is deconned. on
the other hand, for s < n 2 the thermodynamics of the ensemble of
d0-branes is well-described by the black d0 geometry. strong string
coupling e|hor  1 sets in at s  n 8/7, as one sees from (1.5),(1.8).
for lower entropies/energies, the proper eective description of the hori-
zon geometry (and therefore the thermodynamics) takes place in eleven
dimensional m-theory. finally, horizon localization on the m-circle x11

dp-branes on t p for p > 

dp-brane thermodynamics for p > 0 has a phase structure that de-
pends on both log s /log n and the dimensionless yang-mills coupling
log v /log n . at suciently weak coupling (large log v /log n ), the
phase structure for all p is essentially the same as for d0-branes at
low enough entropy, since the dynamics must eventually settle into the
quantum mechanics of the momentum zero-modes on the torus. con-
versely, at high entropy (high temperature), the nite volume eects are
irrelevant; one should see a correspondence transition as the coupling is
increased (smaller v ). the correspondence transition is thus bounded
by equation (1.10) or s  n 2, whichever is met rst coming from
weak coupling. figure 1.6 illustrates what happens as the dimension
increases. the shaded region denotes the perturbative gas phase; the
double line is the correspondence transition curve. the horizontal part
of the correspondence boundary separates the perturbative gas from the
black d0-brane phase discussed above. the angled continuation of the
correspondence curve delineates the transition to the black dp-brane
phase. the slope of this part of the correspondence curve separating
the phase of black dp-branes from the perturbative gas phase changes
with p. the direction of the change is in accord with the scaling of the
eective coupling with energy (temperature): for p < 3, one passes from
the perturbative phase to the strong coupling, geometrical phase by de-

6a rough argument [24] is that p11/m  (r0/s)/(n/r11) for highly boosted black holes;
therefore, for n  s, the lorentz contraction p11/m  r0/r11 is such that the horizon is
just contained within the m-circle. closer inspection [25] reveals that the black hole horizon
does not lorentz contract, being a surface of innite redshift; rather, the metric backreacts
on the momentum stress-energy of the black hole, expanding by exactly the same factor
p11/m (hence the bulge depicted in figure 1.4). thus the net eect is the same: the phase
boundary of horizon localization along the m-circle always occurs at n  s.

one expects that the freezing of the brane dynamics into the quantum
thermodynamics of its zero-modes should persist at strong coupling. the
strong coupling thermodynamics is coded in the geometry of the horizon;
the transition to a zero-mode description is seen as the necessity to
perform a t-duality transformation of the horizon geometry in order
to maintain a valid eective description, according to criterion (3) of
section 2.7 on the geometrical side, this is seen from the proper size of
the torus t p wrapped by the dp-branes as the horizon radius decreases.
below some value of r, the t-dual description, for which the size of t p
increases with decreasing r, is the valid one; see figure 1.7. let us make
this change of description; we are now in a d0-brane geometry at the
horizon, smeared over the dual torus t p. as we continue to lower the
entropy, the horizon radius decreases, so eventually we should violate the
criterion (4), and the horizon localizes on the dual torus. also the dilaton
runs toward strong coupling at small radius in a d0-brane background
(equation (1.5)); at some point we will also have to pass to an m-theory
description.

d3-branes. putting together all these considerations leads
to a phase diagram for v > 1. this is illustrated in figure 1.8 for the
d3-brane case, where we have extended the structure to v < 1 using
the s-duality symmetry of maximally supersymmetric 3+1d superyang-

7as far as the gauge theory dynamics is concerned, there is no important distinction between
the t-dual description in terms of the quantum mechanics of d0-branes, as opposed to the
dimensional reduction of the dp-brane gauge theory, at temperatures suciently smaller than
1.

localized on t 3; and e: boosted 11d
d: boosted 11d schwarzschild black hole,

w 11, etc.) and transition curves a, b, c; , ,  are explained in the text. the sym-

3+1d n = 4 sym.

b: continuation of the localization transition below s  n (the
slope changes when the phase boundary (c) is crossed, due to the
change in horizon topology).
c: localization of the horizon on x11 at s  n .

we distinguish correspondence transitions from localization transitions
by denoting the former with double lines, the latter by single lines.
again, to avoid clutter only half of the transition curves are designated,
the others being copies under s-duality.

ory, in order to maintain a proper low-energy description of the horizon
geometry according to the criteria of section 2. these transformations
are changes of description of the horizon geometry which do not aect
the equation of state, thus are not phase boundaries. they are denoted
by dotted lines and labelled by greek letters:

: s-duality at gym = 1;
: t-duality when the proper size of t 3 is string scale;
-: lift to m-theory when the string coupling becomes order one
at the horizon.

the patches where dierent low-energy descriptions hold within a given
phase are indicated on the left half of figure 1.8.

note that for ( log v

log n ) > 1/3 the structure is that of d0-branes, see fig-
ure 1.5. however, there is a slight dierence; approaching the correspon-
dence curve from above, the temperature of the perturbative open string

d2-branes and d4-branes. the structure of the phase
diagram for v > 1 is essentially the same for all dp-branes wrapping
t p, diering only in the slope of the corresponence curve, figure 1.6.
the analogous phases and transition curves carry the same labels as
in figure 1.8. however, for p 6= 3, there is typically no symmetry re-
lating the phase diagram at v < 1 to that for v > 1, and further
analysis is necessary for this regime. the details depend on p, and a
case-by-case analysis is necessary. we will illustrate with the examples
of d2-branes and d4-branes (see figures 1.9 and 1.10). small v cor-
responds to large coupling in the dp-brane gauge theory, at the scale
of the torus cycle size; thus one can think of the passage to small v at
large entropy/temperature (where p + 1 dimensional kinematics applies)
as the strong coupling limit. for p = 2, this is a ow to the ir; for p = 4
one ows to the uv.

ance; the eective number of eld theoretic degrees of freedom is the

16

coecient of the spatial volume v p in the last factor, i.e. n 3/2;8 it would
be interesting to have an explanation of this scaling from the gauge the-
ory side. the scaling (1.23) diers from that of the d2-brane, equation
(1.9). starting from the black d2 correspondence curve and continu-
ing to the left at constant entropy, one rst lifts to the m-theory black
m2-brane geometry when the dilaton at the horizon becomes order one
(the dotted line labelled  in the gure); the m2-brane being pointlike
in the eleventh dimension, the horizon can localize along the m-circle,
and does so along the transition curve (d) in figure 1.9 (the curve (d)
is its continuation below s  n ). it is this localized m2-brane phase
that has the equation of state (1.23).
if we now start in this m2-brane phase, and pass to smaller en-
tropy/temperature at xed v , the size of the t 2 wrapped by the m2-
branes (measured at the horizon) shrinks until it becomes planck size.
m-theory on a sub-planckian two-torus is dual to a circle in iib string
theory [26][27], and the m2-brane stack dualizes into a black wave along
this circle. this change of description is the dotted line (--) in the
gure. eventually the wave localizes along this circle to a boosted black
hole in iib string theory. all told, the set of phases is

which it descends from in order that the theory is well-dened. geome-
try again supplies the answer [28][29][11]: the d4-brane geometry lifts
to m-theory ve-brane at strong coupling, and the required xed point
is a six-dimensional nonabelian tensor eld theory with (2,0) supersym-
metry, about which little is known. from (1.9), the equation of state of

and one can check that the horizon geometry of the m-lifted metric
(1.5) is locally ads7  s4. because the m-circle lies parallel to the
brane, in this case there can be no localization transition of the horizon
along this direction; hence the d4 equation of state merely needs to
be reinterpreted as that of a higher-dimensional eld theory. we see
that the theory lives on a torus, four of whose coordinates have period
, while the fth is of size g2
ym [28]; the eective number of degrees of
freedom appears to be n 3 (more about this in section 4 below).

by now the structure of duality transformations/phase transitions
should be familiar, so they are labelled directly on figure 1.10. one
new feature  a correspondence transition at strong coupling  does
arise at the lower left. as the entropy/temperature is lowered in this
regime, the horizon size of the original t 4 shrinks, while the m-circle
remains somewhat larger. thus at some point we will want to reduce to
iib string theory along the t 4.9 this sequence of transformations turns
the d4/m5-brane charge into iib perturbative string winding around
the m-circle (the circle related to the 4+1d sym coupling). the result-
ing perturbative string should have a correspondence transition where a
thermally excited, perturbative macroscopic string has less free energy
than the black geometry. thus the phase labelled matrix string in the
gure: a perturbative string arises from the strong coupling dynamics
of a gauge theory, as in [30][31][32].

3.3

qualitative checks

the strong-coupling regime of the phase diagram has been evaluated
using black geometry. how much of this structure can we motivate from
the gauge theory side?

s < n : one can take the d0-brane interactions determined from
the born-oppenheimer approximation; the virial theorem and mean
eld theory then lead to the equation of state scaling of boosted
11d black holes [24][25][33] (in the same spirit as one estimates
the size and properties of an atom using the virial theorem and
uncertainty principle).

n < s < n 2: miao li [34] has given the following estimate of
the properties of the localized black d0-brane phase: suppose the

indicates that a deconnement transition is taking place.

horizon localization: the gregory-laamme localization transi-
tion take place uniformly for all p along a curve s  v 9/2n 1/2.
susskind [35] has argued that this is an analogue of the gross-
witten large n phase transition of pure 1+1d gauge theory on
a circle.
in the gross-witten toy model, the eigenvalues of the
gauge eld zero-mode (the only gauge-invariant degrees of free-
dom) undergo a phase transition. the eigenvalues themselves live
on a circle, and at high temperature they ll the circle, while at
low temperature they clump together. similarly, the locations of
d0-branes on a p-torus t p are the eigenvalues of the gauge eld on
the dual torus t p. a smeared horizon has the d0-branes spread
across the torus cycles, while a localized horizon clumps the eigen-
values together. the details probably dier from the toy model.
for instance, the gross-witten transition is third order, whereas
the gregory-laamme transition proceeds via the development of
a soft mode in the perturbation spectrum of the horizon, leading
one to expect a second-order transition.

qualitative phase structure. determined above via geometry, the
phase structure matches what is known for the strongly-coupled
gauge theory. maximally supersymmetric yang-mills has strong-
coupling xed points for p = 1, 2, 3, 4 [36], and we have seen in the
examples that the appropriate regime of the phase diagram has
the equation of state scaling in the manner dictated by conformal
invariance.

one of the intriguing issues is why such obviously naive arguments seem
to be so successful in capturing the properties of the strong coupling,
geometrical phases; for instance, why does mean eld theory yield the
correct scaling exponents?

phases of 3+1d sym on s

the low-entropy/temperature structure of brane dynamics on a torus
depends heavily on the global topology; the ep+1 u-duality [20] was an
essential ingredient in maintaining a valid eective description of the
horizon geometry in strong eective coupling. there is no such dual-
ity group for gauge theory on the sphere, so we should expect a rather
dierent phase structure. nevertheless, when geometry describes the
thermodynamics, we expect the same sorts of phenomena: correspon-
dence transitions bound the validity of the geometrical description; and
localization transitions can occur when the horizon is of the same order
as a cycle size, if the brane is not wrapped around that cycle. the scal-
ings of the various transitions were worked out in [37], and the results
are plotted in figure 1.11. the structure at s > n 2 is the same as for

the three-torus, since here the thermal wavelength is smaller than the
size of the compact space and the boundary conditions are irrelevant.
the perturbative open string gas has a correspondence transition when
the t hooft coupling (or its dual) is of order one, to an ads5  s5
schwarzschild black hole; the horizon size is larger than (and hence
smeared across) the ve-sphere transverse to the branes. there is a
localization transition in this strong-coupling region at s  n 2 (horizon
radius of order the ve-sphere scale), to a ten-dimensional schwarzschild
black hole completely localized on ads5  s5. the free energy of a per-
turbative string (whose radius of gyration is much larger than the radius

phases of black holes/branes

21

of curvature of the ambient anti-desitter space) wins out over this black
hole at suciently weak coupling, leading to a continuation of the corre-
spondence curve below s  n 2. a dilute gas of gravitons in ads5  s5
dominates at the lowest entropies at strong coupling; the phase tran-
sition to a 10d schwarzschild black hole is just the gravitational jeans
instability. note that both the hagedorn phase and the localized 10d
black hole phase would be missed in an analysis using the canonical
ensemble; since these two phases do not have positive specic heat, cou-
pling the system to a heat bath pumps energy/entropy into the system
such that one jumps directly from the supergravity gas phase to the
smeared black hole phase above s  n 2.
4.

the d1-d5 system and phases of
little string theory

as a nal illustration of the application of thermodynamic techniques
to learn about the properties of brane dynamics, consider [7] the d1-
d5 system compactied on a torus t 4  s1, with the four-torus having
volume v4 and the circle having radius r. this system has a rich history
(see for example [38]). here, we will see in the thermodynamics some
hints of the origin of the apparently o(n 3) degrees of freedom of the
m-theory vebrane observed in (1.24).

we have seen that, as the entropy is lowered, u-duality transmutes
brane charge into momentum; we obtained the innite momentum frame
description of schwarzschild black holes in m-theory. adding a second
charge to the system, we should expect that we will now nd a boosted
brane at low entropies. the d1-d5 system is such that we nd the
imf description of m-theory vebranes at low momentum [39]. the
associated classical geometry is

with yi  yi + v 1/4
, i = 1...4, and y5  y5 + r. one can think of
this system as a stack of q5 vebranes in a superselection sector with
q1 embedded one-branes. a d1-brane inside a d5-brane is the same
as an instanton in the d5 gauge theory [40][41]; since instantons have
codimension four, the instanton in 5+1 superyang-mills is a 1+1d soliton
(eectively a string). the instanton moduli space has bosonic dimension
of order q1q5, the number of perturbative 1-5 strings; thus one might

22

expect that k  q1q5 is the measure of the number of degrees of freedom
in the system.
without the d1 charge q1, we saw (equation (1.13)) that the ther-
modynamics of q5 d5-branes had a limiting temperature  hagedorn
behavior  characteristic of an underlying string with an (inverse) ten-
sion

note that this is not the limit usually taken  s  0, with er, gs,
and v4/4
s held xed  which yields the much-studied ads3  s3  t 4
near-horizon geometry (c.f. a. stromingers lectures). this latter limit
shrinks away the four-torus transverse to the d1 winding, so that the
system becomes 1+1 dimensional. here we are interested in maintaining
the full 5+1 dimensional nature of the little string dynamics. in terms
of the radial scales in the geometry, we are taking q5  q1, r0; dierent
regimes will arise depending on whether q1 > r0 or q1 < r0.
the energy in the system can again be read o the 5d einstein frame
metric, and the entropy is as always the horizon area in (10d) planck
units. after a bit of algebra, one can process the equation of state into
the following form: at high entropies, the strongly coupled equation of
state is

e = p|| +r(s/2 1/2

e )2 + p2
||

,

(1.30)

where p|| = kr/e  k/ r (i.e. r = e /r) behaves as an eective
momentum carried by the system  the equation of state is that of a
relativistic system of invariant mass m = s/2 1/2
e . thus we have a
boosted hagedorn gas. in the innite momentum frame limit p||  m ,
we recover the equation of state s = 2k  2re of btz black holes;

this is the further limit required to obtain the ads3 horizon geometry.
since both types of brane are wrapped around the circle of radius r,
this circle shrinks the fastest with decreasing horizon radius; we should
expect to have to t-dualize it relatively early on in applying the criteria
of section 2. the resulting d0-d4 system can localize on the dual circle
(loosely speaking, the one of radius r). the localization transition is
nothing other than the hagedorn transition of the eective string! the

we can understand the rst of these in the following way: g2
ym/r in 5+1d
is the 4+1d yang-mills coupling, so (1.31) is the same equation of state
as the vebrane gas encountered in section 3.2.2. thus, at relatively low
momenta (entropy dominating over the boost  1/2
e p||), the hagedorn
transition is one of long, thermally excited eective strings overtaking
the gas of modes of the (2,0) supersymmetric tensor eld theory that
describes the vebrane dynamics at lower energies.

the second equation of state, equation (1.32), should describe the
zero-mode dynamics of the toroidally compactied vebrane, if our
previous examples serve as an accurate guide.
in these single-charge
brane systems, we found that the low-entropy structure obeyed in-
nite momentum frame kinematics of highly boosted objects; indeed, the
hagedorn phase (1.30) exhibits precisely such behavior. to cast (1.32) in
this form, we posit that the strongly coupled system occupies an eective
transverse four-torus of size

v4 =

q5
q1

v4 ;

(1.33)

this is reminiscent of other gauge systems [42][24] where at low entropies
the holonomies of the gauge elds arrange themselves in such a way as
to modify the box size seen by the eective degrees of freedom. with
this redenition, and the apparent longitudinal box size r arising in the
hagedorn phase, we can recast the localized equations of state (1.31),
(1.32) as

(1.35)

note that these parameter redenitions uniformly encode the data in
all strong-coupling phases. most importantly, the q3
5 count of degrees
of freedom in the bare equation of state has been processed into the
dressed count of k = q1q5 degrees of freedom, which is more like what

24

of invariant mass m  s3/2/(k v 1/2

we were expecting. also, equation of state (1.35) now has the form
required by innite momentum frame kinematics, suggesting an object
)1/2 replaces the boosted hagedorn
string below the hagedorn transtion. this is the equation of state of a
2+1d relativistic gas of k degrees of freedom, living in an eective box
of size v 1/2
. a good candidate remains to be found for the composition
of this eective membrane-like object.

matics at p||  e, with the imf side being that of lower entropy. further

i.e. the entropy per degree of freedom at the transition is determined

remarkably, a system that we otherwise understand very poorly, be-
ing some sort of strongly coupled string theory without gravity, has its
thermodynamics controlled by black geometry! in particular, the hage-
dorn transition of the eective string is a geometrical transition of hori-
zon localization. as in the matrix theory of 11d supergravity, a system
whose underlying degrees of freedom are otherwise hard to understand,
the introduction of a superselection charge with the interpretation of mo-
mentum leads to a simplication. in fact, the analogy is rather direct:
the matrix model of 11d supergravity describes a system with longitu-
dinal momentum p|| = n/r11, in terms of the n  n matrix quantum
mechanics of n d0-branes; here, the matrix model of m5-branes appears
to carry boost p|| = k/ r and have k degrees of freedom, which might be
traced back to the dynamics of the q1  q5 matrix of 1-5 strings.
much remains to be understood, however. the forms of the equa-
tion of state (1.35),(1.34) are the low- and high-entropy asymptotics of
the full equation of state derived from the d0-d4 black hole localized
on a transverse circle, in the limits r0  q1 and r0  q1, respectively.
one would like to understand the nite size eects that give rise to
the membrane-like structure apparent in (1.35); these do not have the
structure of a canonical boosting as in (1.30) [7].10 it would be helpful
to have a model to explain how the eective box sizes r and v4 arise dy-
namically. for instance, r was motivated as the t-dual of the original
winding radius r of the d1-branes, using the eective string scale e ;
however, the little string theory does not really have such a global duality
symmetry. the factor of q5 in v4 is likely the result of global holonomy
of the d5 gauge elds linking together the individual vebranes as one
traverses the cycle of the four-torus; the inverse dependence on q1 seems
puzzling, though.

5.

concluding remarks

it is remarkable that such a wide range of parameter space in the
thermodynamics of maximally supersymmetric gauge theory is accessible
to study via a set of dual geometrical descriptions. moreover, the dual
geometrical descriptions exemplify in a unifying fashion much of the
duality structure of m-theory on tori, linking together the maldacena
and matrix conjectures. thermodynamic considerations are one of the

10on the other hand, when the boost is along a direction in which the horizon is smeared,
generically the equation of state does not have a canonically boosted form; so we might
turn the problem around, and ask why the hagedorn equation of state (1.30) does have a
canonically boosted form. nevertheless the low-entropy limit of both the hagedorn equation
of state and (1.35) has the standard innite momentum frame form.

26

few non-bps probes we have of strongly couped brane systems, and may
(as in section 4) lead us to new insights about their eective degrees of
freedom at dierent scales.

the brane ensemble at nite n undergoes decay via hawking radia-
tion; thus the time evolution of the system gradually traces a path on the
phase diagram. in our analysis, we have ignored the fact that the brane
dynamics on a torus has a large moduli space of at directions, corre-
sponding to separating the branes transversely; in fact this is perhaps
the simplest decay mode for very near-extremal black holes composed
out of toroidally wrapped branes. thermodynamics is valid in the large
n limit, when the decay time can be made arbitrarily long relative to
other time scales in the dynamics. but it would seem that we can probe
arbitrarily large radii with arbitrarily little energy cost; what happened
to the uv/ir relation, equation (1.13)? it is probe-dependent. objects
probing the at directions in the moduli space are dp-branes moving out
on the coulomb branch of the eective p+1d superyang-mills theory;
the uv/ir relation applies to supergravity modes that do not carry dp-
brane charge, related to single-trace operators in the gauge theory.1112
the lesson is that the softest modes of the system are those that carry
dp-brane charge, and appears to be the key as to when there is a dual
representation of quantum gravity in terms of a theory without grav-
ity. the idea is that when we accumulate a high density of charged
objects, soft excitations occurring inside the charge radius must carry
the charge, or are built from composites of charged objects. similar
phenomena abound in condensed matter systems, the prime example
being the fermi surface of a conductor, where all the light excitations
are built out of electronic constituents. the correspondence fails (e.g.
for d6-branes on t 6) when there are soft excitations that are not built
out of the basic charged constituents; then one loses control over the
gravitational degrees of freedom since they are not cut o by the regu-
larity of behavior at high energy in eld theory. this breakdown of the
correspondence is reected on the gravity side in the negative specic
heat of the corresponding black holes.

11matrix theory is the extreme example of this phenomenon  the light excitations are the
center-of-mass motions of collections of d0-branes, while the single-trace operators that are
perturbations of the supergravity d0-brane geometry require more energy to excite.
12in the d3-brane gauge theory on s3, the coulomb branch is lifted by the scalar eld
coupling to the curvature r2. in this case, the uv/ir relation is more universal.
