abstract: the cancellation of u(1)-gauge and u(1)-gravitational anomalies in certain
d = 4 n = 1 type iib orientifolds is analyzed in detail, from a string theory point of
view. we verify the proposal that these anomalies are cancelled by a green-schwarz
mechanism involving only twisted ramond-ramond elds. by factorizing one-loop par-
tition functions, we also get the anomalous couplings of d-branes, o-planes and orbifold
xed-points to these twisted elds. twisted sectors with xed-planes participate to the
inow mechanism in a peculiar way.

thanks to the discovery of d-branes and the understanding of their prominent role
in string theory [1], new interesting possibilities have opened up to construct phe-
nomenologically viable string vacua. among others, four dimensional n = 1 type iib
orientifolds [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] represent an example of new perturbative models that have
become accessible in alternative to the well-studied heterotic compactications. an
interesting issue in these new vacua is anomaly cancellation. it has been proposed and
argued in [8] that both u(1)-gauge and u(1)-gravitational anomalies are cancelled by a
generalization of the d = 4 green-schwarz (gs) mechanism [9], involving the exchange
of twisted ramond-ramond (rr) closed string states only. this proposal has been
analyzed in detail at the level of low-energy eective action in [10] (see also [11, 12]). a
string theory analysis of some of the anomaly cancelling terms for these orientifolds has
been given in [13], which is however limited to special models and for gauge anomalies
only. due to the potential relevance of these string vacua in building realistic mod-
els (see for instance [14]), it is of interest to perform a more complete analysis of the
cancellation of anomalies in these models at the string level.

in [15], a general method for the study of anomalies in string theory vacua, based
on the computation of the topological one-loop partition function in the presence of

1

gauge and gravitational backgrounds, has been described. at lowest order in derivatives
(momenta), this calculation yields directly the one-loop anomaly from the charged
massless (open string) spectrum and at the same time (minus) the tree-level inow of
anomaly mediated by neutral massless (closed string) elds. by analyzing the transverse
channel, it is possible to determine which states participate to the gs mechanism.
on the other hand, the direct channel analysis allows a precise check of the charged
spectrum.

our results are in agreement with the proposal of [8]: the only elds participating
to the inow of anomaly are combinations of twisted rr axions (with twists dierent
from z2). notice that this is in striking contrast with what happens in six-dimensional
n = 1 iib orientifolds, where it was explicitly shown in [15] that all closed rr string
states, both twisted and untwisted, participate in general to the anomaly cancellation
mechanism. we also derive by factorization of the above one-loop partition functions,
the wess-zumino (wz) couplings for d9-branes, d5-branes and orbifold xed-points
to the twisted rr axions. interestingly, the gravitational couplings for xed-points can
be completely reabsorbed in those of the d-branes present in the models, with the net
eect of rescaling by a factor of 3/2 the gravitational part.

for the n = 1 sectors, i.e. those without planes left xed by the orbifold action,
all the anomalous couplings can then be rewritten in a unied way, as reported in the
formulae (4.4) and (4.8). the n = 2 sectors, containing xed-planes, are instead more
subtle. in these cases, a non-vanishing inow of anomaly arises only in the 95 sector
and correspondingly it is not possible to x unambiguously the anomalous couplings by
factorization. however, one can conclude that neither the d9-branes nor the d5-branes
can couple to the simple and natural symmetric combination of the corresponding rr
twisted axions, as happens in n = 1 sectors. although we do not have a satisfactory
and precise explanation of this fact, we will see that the general form of these couplings
might allow interesting tree-level corrections to the gauge couplings, even for unbroken
non-abelian gauge group. this is in contrast to the situation in the n = 1 sectors,
where the presence of fayet-iliopoulos terms, related by supersymmetry to some of
the wz terms above, xes to zero the tree-level gauge couplings dependence on the
twisted neveu-schwarz-neveu-schwarz (nsns) scalars, supersymmetric partners of the
rr axions. without entering into all the details of the low-energy eective action, which
has been extensively analyzed in [8, 13, 10], we also discuss the spontaneous breaking of
u(1) factors through a higgs mechanism induced by these anomaly-cancelling couplings,
both in the n = 1 and n = 2 sectors.

the paper is organized as follows. in section two, we briey review some properties
of the orientifold models under analysis.
in section three, we compute the one-loop
partition function in the odd spin-structure yielding the inow of anomaly. in section
four, we deduce then the wz couplings by factorization. the last section contains a
brief eld theory analysis of our results. finally, we report in the appendix the explicit
combinations of u(1) gauge elds which become massive.

2. d = 4 n = 1 orientifolds

in this section, we review some generalities about the d = 4 n = 1 type iib orientifolds
we consider. these models always contain 32 d9-branes, required to cancel the tadpoles
from the o9-plane associated to the world-sheet parity operator , and 32 d5-brane
wrapped along the third compact plane when n is even, required to cancel the tadpoles
from the 16 o5-planes associated to the element r of the orientifold group, r being
a reection along the rst two compact planes. in the following, we shall restrict to the
maximally symmetric case in which all the d5-branes sit at the origin of the rst two
compact planes.

zn orientifolds

the zn action is generated by the element  = exp(2iviji), where ji is the rotation
generator in the i-th compact plane and vi are the corresponding components of the
twist vector dening the action, v = (v1, v2, v3). in the open string sector, the twist k
is represented by matrices k on the chan-paton wave function. in a suitable basis,
one can choose k,9 = k,5 = ()k. the zn actions leading to consistent models with
cancelled tadpoles are given in the table below.

the spectra of these orientifold models have been analysed in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], but
there are some minor discrepancies about the charged states content, aside those arising
from some arbitrariness in the choice of the twist matrices in tables 1 and 2. we x
these spectra by comparing the standard eld-theory computation and our string theory
computation of the anomaly. the result are reported in the tables of next section.

3. gauge and gravitational anomalies

the models we are considering have in general non-vanishing gauge/gravitational one-
loop anomalies, which are expected to be cancelled by an inow of anomaly through the
gs mechanism. the latter can be deduced only from a direct string theory computation.
it has been shown in [15] that the total anomaly vanishes for any orientifold model
with cancelled tadpoles, as a consequence of the cancellation of two equal and opposite
contributions which can be identied with the total one-loop anomaly and the total
tree-level inow respectively. the central result of [15] is that the anomaly and inow
polynomials are both given by the same one-loop partition function in the rr odd spin-
structure, in external gauge and gravitational backgrounds 1. using this strategy, one
can analyze in detail the pattern of anomaly cancellation and deduce by factorization
(up to overall signs and trivial rescaling of the elds) the relevant cp-odd couplings in
the low-energy action.

recall that contribution to the one-loop anomaly polynomial from a spinor in the
representation  of the gauge group, in a gauge and gravitational background with
curvatures f and r, involves the chern-character of the gauge bundle and the roof-

1in order to compute the anomaly polynomial and not the anomaly itself, one has to go in two

dimensions higher and omit the bosonic zero modes.

genus of the tangent bundle, and is given by the famous formula 2

i 

1/2 = ch(f ) ba(r) .

it is convenient to decompose all the representations of the u(n) and so(n) factors
as tensor products of two fundamental representations associated to the end-points of
open strings. correspondingly, the chern character appearing in the anomaly decom-
pose as products of chern characters c(f ) in the fundamental representation,

c(f ) = chn(f ) = trn[eif/2] .

the adjoint representations of u(n) and so(n) do not contribute, and for the antisym-
metric representation of u(n) one gets the following decomposition:

ch n(n1)

(f ) =

2

1

2hc(f )2  c(2f )i .

(3.1)

from a string theory point of view, the polynomial associated to both the anomaly and
the inow is given by the total one-loop partition function in the odd spin-structure.
only the annulus and the mobius strip amplitudes contribute. the klein bottle con-
tribution vanish because of the impossibility of having the correct number of fermionic
zero modes inserted. this reects the fact that there are no pure gravitational anoma-
lies in four dimensions and only charged states can contribute to the anomaly. summing
over all the d-brane sectors, one gets therefore

i = x,=9,5

i 

a + x=9,5

i 
m .

(3.2)

we shall see in the following that the annulus partition function produces naturally a
contribution proportional to c(f )2, the mobius strip giving instead c(2f ). compar-
ing with (3.1), this observation allows to reconstruct the anomalous charged matter
spectrum of each model from the string theory expression for the anomaly polynomial.

3.1 zn orientifolds

in the operatorial formalism, the relevant odd spin-structure amplitudes to compute on
the annulus and the mobius strip are encoded in the following partition functions:

where a sum over chan-paton indices is understood. their evaluation is rather straight-
forward. being topological indices, only massless modes contribute, massive states can-
celling by supersymmetry. it is convenient to dene, in each compact plane i = 1, 2, 3
and each k-twisted sector, k = 1, ..., n  1, the quantities

si
k = 2 sin kvi , ci

k = 2 cos kvi .

k = (si

k)2 per plane, and in total one has nk = n 1

the number of k-xed-points, that is those points which are xed under k-twists, is
n i
k xed-points in the whole
compact space and n 3
k in the third plane, where the d5-branes wrap. also, it is natural
to introduce the modied zn chern-character

k n 2

k n 3

chk(f ) = tr[k eif/2] ,

(3.5)

where the trace is in the chan-paton representation.

the untwisted k = 0 sector vanish for all the surfaces and d-brane sectors, because
of the presence of unsoaked fermionic zero modes in the internal directions, and we
restrict therefore to k 6= 0. on the annulus, a pair of bosons and fermions with neumann
neumann (nn) boundary conditions in the i-th compact plane contribute (si
k)2 and
si
k respectively, whereas a pair of bosons and fermions with dirichlet dirichlet (dd)
boundary conditions give 1 and si
k. no elds with nd boundary conditions contribute,
having a half-integer mode expansion and correspondingly no zero-energy states. the

elds in the non-compact directions give instead the contribution i chk(f) chk(f) ba(r)

in the  sector. taking into account the number of xed-points, nk in the 99 sector

as a consequence of tadpole cancellation, all irreducible non-abelian gauge anomalies
vanish. therefore, only mixed u(1)-gauge and u(1)-gravitational anomalies arise. the
former gets contribution only from the annulus, whereas for the latter both the annulus

4. factorization

having computed all the inows, the anomalous couplings to rr elds can be obtained
by factorization, in the spirit of [17] (see also [18]).
in order to do so, one needs a
precise knowledge of the massless closed string spectra, which have been studied in
detail in [5, 10]. analyzing (3.6)-(3.8) and (3.16)-(3.18) in the transverse channel, it is
then possible to identify, in most cases, which of these states mediate the inows. in
four dimensions, the only states involved in the gs mechanism are axionic scalars and
their dual 2-forms in the rr sector, belonging to linear multiplets 3.

as anticipated in the introduction, the analysis of the n = 2 sectors containing
xed-planes is complicated by the fact the the inow in the 99 and 55 sectors vanish.
also the n = 4 untwisted sector present some particularities, although it yields a
trivially vanishing inow. we will therefore analyze separately the n = 1, n = 2 and
n = 4 sectors.

4.1 n = 1 sectors

for n = 1 sectors, we assume that both d9 and d5-branes couple in a symmetric way to
all the twisted states arising at orbifold xed-points contained in their world-volume 4.
as we will see, it seems that this quite reasonable assumption needs to be relaxed, in
order to explain the factorization in n = 2 sectors.

zn models
for zn models, the orientifold projection relates the k and (n  k)-twisted sectors,
which together yield always linear multiplets [10]. the distinct twisted sectors are

3throughout this section, for simplicity we will always write anomalous couplings both for scalars
and their dual 2-forms, despite the well-known fact that there is no local and covariant lagrangian
in which a potential and its dual can appear at the same time. more precisely, one should write the
couplings to the dual potential as corrections to the kinetic terms for the eld strength of the original
potential.

4clearly, this assumption is needed in our factorization procedure, but by a direct computation on

the disk or crosscap one should be able to nd the correct combination of elds.

therefore labeled by k = 1, ..., [(n  1)/2]. the n = 1 sectors are those with k  s,
where

s =nk = 1, ..., [(n  1)/2]| nk 6= 0o ,

to facilitate the analysis, it is convenient to keep all the nk linear multiplets arising
from the k and (n  k)-twisted sectors as independent states, although in general only
n 
k  nk of them are independent. the physical n 
k propagating states are identied
after suitable zn -projections, as in [15, 10], and are reported in the appendix.

in order to gure out which states are responsible for the various inows, recall that
the insertion of k acts as a k-twist in (3.3) and as a 2k-twist in (3.4), for the closed
string state exchanged in the transverse channel. untwisted closed string exchange can
arise only from the k = 0 part of (3.6) and the k = 0 or k = n/2 (when present) parts
of (3.8). the k = 0 part is always trivially vanishing and from the form of v3 (see table
1) it is easy to see that the same is true for the k = n/2 part. analogously, no n/2-
twisted closed string states can contribute to the inow: the relevant contributions are
the k = n/2 parts of (3.6) and (3.8), which vanish. there is therefore a non-vanishing
contribution only from k-twisted closed strings, with k 6= 0, n/2. in order to make the
corresponding inow more explicit, it suce to group the k and n  k term of each sum
in (3.6) and (3.8). the relevant 6-form component of the inow can then be rewritten
as a sum over k  s only, of the following expressions:

have anomalous couplings to the gravitational curvature, in close analogy to the six-
dimensional case analyzed in [15]. the corresponding inow is due to (2k)-twisted
axions and c(2k) = c(n 2k) when 2k > n/2. moreover, as ordinary at orientifold
planes, these couplings involve the hirzebruch polynomial l(r) [19].

(k) and their duals ik

(k) and its dual ik

notice that in deriving couplings by factorization there is always the arbitrariness
of rescaling each ik
(k) by two opposite factors. here and in the following
we write the couplings in the most symmetric way. furthermore, possible couplings that
do not give rise to inow, like couplings only to the axion or only to its corresponding
tensor eld, are obviously undetectable through this approach.

recall now that using the condition of non-abelian anomaly cancellation (3.11),
the total anomaly (3.10) simplies to the expression (3.12) looking like a pure annulus
inow, the mobius contribution to the mixed u(1)-gravitational anomaly being propor-
tional to the corresponding annulus contribution. this observation and the simple form
of the anomaly (3.12) strongly suggest that the only eect of the xed-point couplings
should be to rescale the gravitational couplings of the d-branes. one can check that
this is indeed what happens. the net eect of the xed-point couplings is simply to
rescale by a factor of 3/2 the gravitational part of those of d-branes. correspondingly,
the total gs term for n = 1 sectors, obtained by adding the three couplings (4.3),
becomes

zn  zm models
for zn  zm orientifolds, the situation is similar. states which are untwisted with
respect to the zn factor do not contribute to the inow. however, one has to consider
in this case, the orientifold projection
all the twists with respect to the zm factor.
relates (k, l) and (n  k, m  l) twists, yielding n 
k,l linear multiplets from each pair of
twisted sectors. the distinct twisted sectors are then labeled by k = 1, ..., [(n  1)/2],
l = 0, 1, ..., m  1. in general n 
k,l  nk,l but, as before, it is convenient to keep all the
nk,l elds arising in each twisted sector. the n = 1 sectors come from (k, l)  s, with

s =nk = 1, ..., [(n  1)/2] , l = 0, 1, ..., m  1 | nk,l 6= 0o .

proceeding as in the zn case, one nds perfectly similar results for the anomalous
couplings of d-branes and xed-points. again, the contribution of the xed-points can
be rewritten in the same form as the d-brane contributions, by using the condition
(3.20). the total gs coupling in the n = 1 sectors is then found to be:

4.2 n = 2 sectors

n = 2 sectors, i.e. k-twisted sectors containing planes left xed by the orbifold group,
can arise when kvi = integer for some i, in which case n i
k = 0. a subset of these sectors,
the k = n/2 sectors of all the even zn models and the (k = 0, l = 3) sector of the
z3  z6 model, do not contribute at all to the inow, but the eld theory explanation
for this fact is clear and reported in next section. among the remaining sectors, only
the k = 2 sector of the z
6 model and the (k = 1, l = 0, 4) sectors of the z3  z6 model,
give a non-vanishing inow in the 95 sector. the above one is reproduced by adding
the following couplings:

(4.12)

(4.13)

the 2 and 4-forms x and y are the same as before. however, in order to reproduce
a vanishing 99/55 inow and the correct 95 one, two orthogonal combinations of rr
elds have to be introduced,  and , such that h9,5 9,5i = 0 and h9,5 5,9i = 1.
the crucial dierence with the previously analyzed n = 1 sectors is that 9,5 is clearly
not the dual of 9,5.

the massless closed string content in these twisted sectors with non-vanishing inow
is always the same [10, 20]. there are six linear multiplets, but only three of these arise
inside the world-volume of the d5-branes, the other three being combinations of elds
living outside the world-volume of the d5-branes.

at this point, one has to make some assumption in order to extract a denite
answer for the combination of axions  and . a rst reasonable assumption is that
d5-branes couple only to the rst three linear multiplets arising within their world-
volume, whereas d9-branes can couple to all six of them. another equally reasonable
but less obvious assumption is to require a symmetry between all similar xed-points,
as done for the n = 1 sectors. unfortunately, these two assumptions are together
incompatible with the inows computed before, and one of them has necessarily to be
relaxed. in this way, however, even making use of t-duality, which relates the d5 and
d9-brane couplings to each other, one is left with some free parameters which cannot
be completely xed.

we would like to stress that the results of section three nevertheless demonstrate
anomaly cancellation, and that a net inow takes place also in certain n = 2 sectors.
however, we conclude that the factorization approach followed here is not powerful
enough to x unambiguously the combinations of elds entering the corresponding
anomalous couplings. it should be possible to obtain the precise coecient through a
more direct computation on the disk and the crosscap.

14

4.3 n = 4 sectors

a comment is in order also about the untwisted n = 4 sector. as shown in section
three, the inow in this sector is trivially vanishing. however, there are denitely wz
couplings, although they do not interfere to give an inow. this can be understood
by looking at this sector from the d = 10 type i point of view and compactify the
usual anomalous couplings of the d9-branes and the o9-plane on t 6, and those of the
d5-branes and o5-planes (whenever these occur) on a t 2. since the curvatures are
non-trivial only in four-dimensional non-compact space, the only terms surviving this
reduction are those obtained by integrating the ten-dimensional 6-form on t 6, yielding
a four-dimensional scalar, and the six-dimensional 2-form on t 2, yielding another four-
dimensional scalar. since no couplings to the two-forms dual to these scalars appear,
no inow of anomaly is induced.

5. field theory analysis

one of the consequences of the presence of the gs terms (4.4), (4.8), (4.12) and (4.13)
in the low-energy eective action is the spontaneous breakdown of various combinations
of u(1) factors [9, 21, 8], involved in the would-be u(1)-gauge/gravitational anomalies.
the higgs mechanism is due to the couplings to the 2-forms  or , which modify
(after dualization) the kinetic terms for the corresponding axions  or  by a shift in-
volving the u(1) gauge elds. gauge invariance requires then that these elds transform
inhomogeneously under the appropriate gauge transformation, and the scalar is eaten
by the gauge eld. the combinations of u(1) gauge elds involved in this mechanism
are reported in the appendix for each model. as usual, care is needed in interpreting
string theory results in terms of couplings in a low-energy eective action. in our case,
particular attention is needed because of the well-known chiral multiplet - linear mul-
tiplet duality [22]. we do not discuss this issue here, since it has has been extensively
analyzed in [13, 10] in the context of d=4 n = 1 iib orientifolds, and recall simply
that the string theory results derived in last section can be interpreted most directly in
the linear multiplet formulation.

the models considered here have n = 1 supersymmetry. this allows to x the
tree-level form of two other cp-even couplings, related by supersymmetry to the gs
couplings above: fayet-iliopoulos (fi) terms 5 and gauge couplings (gc) depending
on the nsns scalars m, partners of the twisted rr elds. as well known, fi terms
can trigger both supersymmetry and gauge symmetry breaking, and a supersymmetric
vacuum with unbroken non-abelian gauge group requires a vanishing fi term. this is
particularly important since the vacuum expectation values (vev) of the scalars m is
xed by the fi terms.

5in this case, only a tree-level contribution seems to be the present [23].

15

consider rst the n = 1 sectors. the fi terms can be read directly from the  x
couplings in the gs terms of last section, and from the   y couplings one gets the
following gc corrections:

s zn

s zn zm

gc =s 2
n xks

nm x(k,l)s

k z d4x m
(nk,l)1/4x=9,5



(k) tr(kf,f 

 ) ,

k,lz d4x m

(k,l) tr(klf,f 

 ) .

(5.1)

(5.2)

importantly, the fi terms and gc involve the same combination of scalars. for unbro-
ken supersymmetry and non-abelian symmetry, a vanishing fi term implies that the
vev of the combination of scalars appearing in (5.1) and (5.2) vanish as well. unless
one breaks the gauge group and/or supersymmetry, there are no gauge coupling correc-
tions. apart from an overall coecient, our results (5.1)-(5.2) reproduce those of [13],
extending them to other models and gauge elds in the 55 sector.

as expected, n = 2 sectors are more subtle. for z2-twisted n = 2 sectors, which
have xed-planes along the world-volume of the d5-branes, the inow vanishes. this
fact alone is not sucient to rule out corrections to gauge couplings, but supersymme-
try implies that couplings like (5.1)-(5.2) are nonetheless forbidden. indeed, for these
sectors the compact space is eectively r4  t 2  t 4/g, with n = 2 supersymmetry
and the d5-branes wrapped on t 2, and one can therefore treat them as z2-twisted
sectors of dimensionally reduced d = 6 n = 1 orientifolds. in these sectors the only
rr states exchanged are scalars, belonging to d = 6 hypermultiplets [15]. since these
cannot couple to gauge kinetic terms in d = 6 [24], these couplings are forbidden
also in the d = 4 n = 1 model. the situation is dierent for n = 2 sectors with
xed-planes outside the d5-branes world-volume. in these cases, the inow is either
vanishing (k = 3 in z12 and (k = 0, l 6= 0, 3) in z3  z6) or restricted to the 95 sector
(k = 2 in z
6 and (k = 1, l = 0, 4) in z3  z6). in the rst case, a dependence of the
gauge couplings on the corresponding scalars is allowed if no fi term is generated at
all. in the second case, the combination of scalars appearing in the gauge couplings
and the fi terms have to be orthogonal, and again a gauge coupling dependence is
allowed. summarizing, in the orbifold limit where all these scalars have zero vev, no
gauge coupling correction is present in any case, but there is the interesting possibility
of orbifold deformations leading to a non-vanishing tree-level correction to the gauge
couplings, even for unbroken gauge symmetry. a further study is denitely needed to
get a better understanding of these sectors.

analogously to the f  f terms, supersymmetry, or better supergravity, also xes
the form of the various cp-even terms related to the r  r couplings. being higher
order in derivatives, we will not discuss the explicit form of these terms.

a. appendix

we report here the explicit combination of the various would-be anomalous u(1) factors
that become massive for each model.
in order to nd their right combination, it is
important to write the gs couplings of section four in terms of physical elds only. all
the combinations are symmetric in the 9, 5 exchange, as expected by t-duality.

all the elds appearing in (4.4) are physical and the unique u(1) present in the model
gets a mass.

again, all the 7 elds appearing in each of the three sectors in (4.4) are physical. an
independent combination of u(1) factors is present in each sector. correspondingly, all
of the three u(1)s present in the model get a mass.

z6
the 3 elds in the k = 1 sector are all physical. in the k = 2 sector, 1,2,3
(2) are again
all physical, whereas the other 24 elds give rise to only 12 propagating combinations
given by 1/2(i

(2) ), i = 4, ..., 15. the three massive u(1) elds are

again, the arbitrary coecients d and e reect the ambiguity in the factorization pro-
cedure for n = 2 sectors. for this reason, we have not explicitly checked whether the
gauge elds above are always independent or not.
