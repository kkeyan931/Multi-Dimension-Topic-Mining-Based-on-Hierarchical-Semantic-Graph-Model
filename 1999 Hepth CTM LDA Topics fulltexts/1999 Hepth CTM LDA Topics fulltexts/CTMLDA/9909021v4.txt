abstract

we show that the born-infeld theory with n complex abelian gauge
elds written in an auxiliary eld formulation has a u (n, n) duality
group. we conjecture the form of the lagrangian obtained by elim-
inating the auxiliary elds and then introduce a new reality struc-
ture leading to a born-infeld theory with n real gauge elds and an
sp(2n, ir) duality symmetry. the real and complex constructions are
extended to arbitrary even dimensions. the maximal noncompact
duality group is u (n, n) for complex elds. for real elds the duality
group is sp(2n, ir) if half of the dimension of space-time is even and
o(n, n) if it is odd. we also discuss duality under the maximal com-
pact subgroup, which is the self-duality group of the theory obtained
by xing the expectation value of a scalar eld. supersymmetric ver-
sions of self-dual theories in four dimensions are also discussed.

1 introduction

shortly after the appearance of duality in extended supergravity [1, 2] the
theory of duality invariance of theories with abelian gauge elds was devel-
oped in [3, 4]. however, there are very few examples of duality invariant
interacting gauge theories where the lagrangian is known in closed form.
the most famous is the born-infeld theory [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and in this
paper we study its generalization to more than one abelian gauge eld.

in section 2 we present in some detail the theory of duality invariance for
a theory of complex gauge elds with holomorphic duality transformations.
this is an extension of the theory of duality invariance developed in [3, 4]
and was briey discussed in [11]. however, the duality group can be larger
than that presented in [11]. in fact, for a gauge theory with n complex gauge
elds the largest possible duality group is u(n, n). we also discuss how to
obtain such a theory from a theory with a u(n) u(n) duality group, which
is the maximal compact subgroup of u(n, n), by introducing an additional
n-dimensional matrix valued scalar eld.

in section 3 we describe the born-infeld lagrangian introduced in [11]
and written in terms of auxiliary elds.
its form is closely related to the
lagrangian introduced in [12, 13] but diers in two ways. we use a dierent
reality structure for our elds and introduce a dynamical scalar eld such
that the duality group is extended to a noncompact group.

in section 4 we discuss the elimination of the auxiliary elds. we have
not been able to solve analytically the nonlinear matrix equations obtained
from the variation of the auxiliary elds. however we have calculated the
rst few terms in the perturbative expansion of the lagrangian in the eld
strength and based on these we have conjectured in [11] the form of the
lagrangian to all orders. in [11] the conjecture was checked by hand up to
the sixth order. it has now been checked by computer up to the seventeenth
order. in appendix a we discuss an equivalent perturbative expansion of the
lagrangian which simplies the order by order check of the conjecture.

in the theory with auxiliary elds it does not seem possible to work with

1

real gauge elds, but this can be done in the lagrangian with the auxiliary
elds eliminated. as will be shown in section 5 this leads to a born-infeld
theory with an sp(2n, ir) duality group. assuming that the conjecture of
section 4 is correct, this would be the rst example of an interacting gauge
theory whose lagrangian is known to all orders and whose duality group is
as large as the duality group of the maxwell theory with the same number
of gauge elds.

in section 6 we show how to supersymmetrize the born-infeld lagrangian
in the formulation with auxiliary elds. we also present the form without
auxiliary elds of the supersymmetric born-infeld lagrangian with a single
gauge eld and a scalar eld; this theory is invariant under sl(2, ir) duality,
which reduces to u(1) duality if the value of the scalar eld is suitably xed.
versions of this theory without the scalar eld were presented in [14, 15, 16].
in section 7 we generalize our construction to arbitrary even dimensions
by using antisymmetric tensor elds such that the rank of their eld strength
equals half the dimension of space-time. we consider rst theories with a
u(n, n) duality group using complex antisymmetric tensor elds; then we dis-
cuss theories with real antisymmetric tensor elds. these have an sp(2n, ir)
duality group if half of the space-time dimension is even and o(n, n) if it
is odd. the fact that the duality group depends on half the dimension of
space-time was discussed earlier in [17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

finally in appendix b we briey discuss two parametrizations of the coset
space u(n, n)/u(n)  u(n) and show how the left multiplication on u(n, n)
induces fractional transformations in one of the parametrizations. we also
discuss the corresponding coset spaces of the symplectic and orthogonal group
and describe their global structure.

2 duality invariance

in this section we describe how the theory of self-duality introduced in [3, 4]
is modied when we consider complex abelian gauge elds. we only consider
a linear action of the duality group which mixes the eld strengths and

2

their duals but not their complex conjugates. we will refer to this as a
holomorphic action. under these conditions the largest allowed duality group
is u(n, n) where n is the number of complex gauge elds. if we do not require
a holomorphic action, n complex gauge elds are equivalent to 2n real gauge
elds in which case the largest possible duality group is sp(4n, ir). later, in
section 5, we will also introduce a born-infeld action with real gauge elds
which we conjecture to have the largest allowed duality group given the
number of gauge elds. however, the argument leading to this conjecture
involves lagrangians with complex gauge elds.

consider a theory of n complex abelian gauge elds and a scalar eld
s which is an n-dimensional complex matrix. here we do not require s
to be symmetric and as a result we nd a larger duality group than the one
appearing in [11]. the gauge elds only enter in the lagrangian through their
eld strengths f a, where a = 1, . . . , n, and their complex conjugates f a

l = l(f a, f a, s, . . .) .

(1)

the dots in (1) represent possible auxiliary elds which could also be present
in l. as we will show later, with the scalar eld s present the duality
group is noncompact while without the scalar eld only the maximal compact
subgroup survives. we can also add to this lagrangian a kinetic term for
the scalar eld s. as explained in [3] additional physical elds, e.g. spinors,
can also be introduced, but we shall not consider them explicitly in this
paper except in section 6 where the supersymmetric born-infeld theory is
discussed.

the dual eld strength, or rather the hodge dual of the dual eld strength,

throughout this paper we will assume that we are in four space-time dimen-
sions, except in section 7, where we will show how to generalize our results
to theories in even space-time dimensions.

(3)

let  denote all the scalar elds appearing in the lagrangian and  =  .
the innitesimal transformations of the scalar elds are given by

i = i() ,

(4)

where i are components of a vector eld on the scalar eld space. the
most general lagrangian, neglecting possible fermionic elds, has the form
l(f, f , , ) . its variation under (3)(4) can be written as

l =" + (gc t + f dt )


f

+ ( gc + f d)



 f# l ,

where  l is given by

 l = (i 

i + j

the variation of the lagrangian must satisfy certain consistency conditions.

the right hand side of the above equation must be a total derivative since
the left hand side is one. this is possible if

a + d = i , b = b , c = c ,

where  is a real parameter. these are the relations of the fundamental
representation of the u(n, n)  ir lie algebraa. we will only consider the
case when  vanishes. thus we assume

a = d , b = b , c = c .

(8)

the relations (8) dene the fundamental representation of the lie algebra
of u(n, n). however, in general the transformations (4) of the scalar elds
can be implemented only for a subgroup h of u(n, n). the duality group h
depends both on the eld content and the nature of the interactions of the
scalar elds.

using (8) the consistency condition (7) can be written as

(13)

showing that the equations of motion for the scalar elds form a multiplet
under the duality group h.
in the examples discussed in this paper the
duality group will be u(n, n) for complex gauge elds and sp(2n, ir) for real
gauge elds. ignoring a possible ir factor, present only for a nonvanishing
, we will refer to these as the maximal noncompact duality groups.

the corresponding nite duality transformations are given by



g

f   = m

here m is an u(n, n) matrix satisfying

m ik m = ik ,

where m and ik have the block form

m =

a b

c d  ,

ik =

0 1

1 0  .

(14)

(15)

note that the invariant ik dening u(n, n) is the usual o diagonal symplectic
form. this explains the similarity of our results with the real case discussed
in [3]. one can check that (15) implies the following relations for the block
components of m

ca = ac , bd = db , da  bc = 1 .

(16)

6

the innitesimal relations (8) can be obtained from the nite relations (16)
using

a  1 + a , b  b , c  c , d  1 + d .

in much of this paper we consider lagrangians which do not depend on the
scalar eld s, i.e. they depend only on the gauge eld strengths and perhaps
auxiliary scalar elds, and are invariant only under the maximal compact
subgroup u(n)u(n) of u(n, n). then there is a way to introduce the scalar
eld s which extends the duality group to u(n, n). the maximal compact
subgroup u(n)  u(n) is the subgroup of u(n, n) obtained by requiring (16)
and

the corresponding innitesimal relations are (8) and

a = d , b = c .

a = d , b = c .

let l(f, f ) be a lagrangian describing a theory invariant under u(n)u(n),
where we suppress the dependence on the auxiliary elds. then we dene a
new lagrangian

l(f, f , s1, r, r)  l(rf, f r) +

1
2

tr(s1 f f ) ,

(17)

where s1 is a hermitian n-dimensional matrix and r is a nondegenerate
n-dimensional matrix. this lagrangian describes a theory invariant under
u(n, n) if we transform the scalar elds s1 and r as discussed below. as we
will see, the duality invariance of the theory described by l implies that l
depends on r and r only through the hermitian positive denite matrix

s2 = rr .

(18)

we also dene s  s1 + is2. under the duality group s transforms by
fractional transformation

s = (as + b)(cs + d)1 ,

(19)

7

whose innitesimal form is

s = b + as  sd  scs .

it is also convenient to write down the transformation of s2

s2 = (cs + d)s2(cs + d)1 .

(20)

(21)

in (21) and below we use the notation  for the hermitian conjugate of the
inverse.

next we show that the lagrangian l dened in (17) corresponds to a
u(n, n) duality invariant theory. we follow closely [21] where the case of real
gauge elds was considered. the proof in [21] generalizes the introduction of
a single complex scalar eld for a u(1) interacting theory discussed in [9, 10].
using the fact that l(f, f ) satises (11) with compact duality rotations we
have

the relation (22) corresponds to transformations with a = 0 while (23) is
obtained by setting c = 0. we now introduce some convenient notation

f = rf , eg = 2

l(f , f)

f

.

(24)

given a lagrangian l which depends on f but not its derivatives, we may
rewrite (22) and (23) as

we would like to show that under an innitesimal u(n, n) duality transfor-
mation the change in the lagrangian l dened in (17) satises the duality
condition (11)

(f +  f + s1 + r + r)l =

8

1
2

( f bef + gceg) .

(27)

gaegb + f aef b = 0 ,
gaef b  f aegb = 0 .

gaegb + f a ef b = 0 ,
ga ef b  f aegb = 0 .

(22)

(23)

(25)

(26)

a transformation law for r which is consistent with the relation rr = s2

and the duality transformation (21) of s2 is given by

r = r(cs + d)1,

whose innitesimal transformation is r = r(cs + d) . this choice is
somewhat arbitrary since equation (23) is equivalent to the lagrangian l
being invariant under left multiplication of the gauge eld strength by unitary
matrices u

l(uf, f u) = l(f, f ) .

this ensures that left multiplication of r by a unitary matrix leaves the
lagrangian l invariant. it follows that the lagrangian l only depends on
s2 and not on the specic r chosenb, as we have already mentioned. any
variation of the form r = r  r(cs + d), where  is anti-hermitian,
would still preserve the relation rr = s2.

using the above transformation of r one can show that (27) is equivalent

to the vanishing of the following expression

ega gb  ega( f s1)b  (s1ef )a gb + (s1ef )a( f s1)b + (s2ef )a( f s2)b+
i(cid:16)(s2ef )a gb  (s2ef )a( f s1)b  ega( f s2)b + (s1ef )a( f s2)b(cid:17) .

using the relation g = r(g  s1f ), which follows from (2) and (24), the
rst and second lines of this expression are equivalent to the left hand side
of (25) and (26) respectively. thus (27) is satised concluding the proof that
the theory with the lagrangian l is invariant under u(n, n).

conversely,

if we are given a lagrangian l with equations of motion
invariant under u(n, n) we can obtain a theory without the scalar eld s
by setting s = i. then the duality group is broken to the stability group
of s = i which is u(n)  u(n), the maximal compact subgroup. thus we
can easily move between the theory with a scalar eld s and the theory
without s.

bnote that s2 is a positive denite hermitian metric and r is a vielbein. the lagrangian
only depends on the metric and the arbitrariness in the choice of vielbein introduces a u (n)
gauge invariance.

9

we also give the innitesimal transformation of f and g

rcrg  ircrf ,
g =
f = rcrf  ircrg .

(28)

the last term in (28) is a unitary transformation and could be canceled
by using a dierent choice for the transformation of r. the rst term is
an innitesimal duality transformation belonging to the maximal compact
subgroup u(n)  u(n). note however that it is a space-time dependent
duality transformation.

next we nd the dierential equation that a lagrangian must satisfy if the
equations of motion are invariant under the maximal compact duality group.
we are therefore considering a lagrangian without the scalar eld s. we will
also assume that the auxiliary elds have been eliminated, the eld strengths
appear in the lagrangian only through the lorentz invariant combinations

ab

f a f b, ab

2 ef a f b,

(29)

and that the lagrangian is a sum of traces (or of products of traces) of
monomials in  and . if the lagrangian has such a form, equation (23) is
satised. then under a compact duality transformation the variation of the
lagrangian is

where we dene

l = tr(l + l) ,

l 

l
t , l

using the denitions (2) and (29), we nd that (22) is equivalent to

ll  ll + ll + ll +  = 0 .

(30)

this is a generalization of the dierential equation introduced in [10] where
the case of a single real gauge eld was considered. equation (30) is invariant
under the following transformation

 =  ,
 =  .

(31)

if one considers a self-dual theory with n real eld strengths fr, where
f b
now  and  are dened by ab = 1/4 f a
r, equa-
tion (30) still holds. in this case one can extend the duality group from u(n)
to sp(2n, ir) by introducing scalar elds as in [21]. although these remarks
will be central in later arguments, their proofs closely resemble those in the
case of complex elds, so we omit them.

3 born-infeld with auxiliary fields

in this section we describe a u(n, n) duality invariant nonlinear gauge theory
with n complex gauge elds [11]. the use of auxiliary elds in the lagrangian
is inspired by the work of [12, 13] and simplies the check of duality invari-
ance.

we begin with the following lagrangian introduced in [11]

l = re tr [ i(  s) 

i
2

s2 + in ] ,

(32)

where n =   i . as mentioned in section 2, here we do not require s
to be symmetric. the auxiliary elds  and  are n dimensional complex
matrices. if we could solve their equations of motion and use the solution in
the lagrangian (32) we would nd a lagrangian which depends only on ,
 and s. obtaining this lagrangian is the main thrust of our paper.

if we set s = i in the above lagrangian, the theory is only self-dual
under the maximal compact subgroup u(n)u(n), as discussed in section 2.
however, if we now reintroduce the scalar eld as in (17), the new lagrangian
is the same as (32) only after eld redenitions of  and . we can also add
a kinetic term for the scalar eld s. this term must be duality invariant
since, as we will see shortly, the rest of the lagrangian already satises the
self-duality condition (11). for example we can add a nonlinear -model
lagrangian dened on the coset space u(n, n)/u(n)  u(n) with the metric
given by

trh(s  s)1ds(s  s)1dsi .

(33)

11

the metric (33) is kahler since it is obtained from the kahler potential

k = tr ln(s2) .

(34)

this kahler potential changes by a kahler transformation under (20); this
ensures that the metric is duality invariant.

it will be convenient to decompose the auxiliary elds into hermitian

matrices, as we have already done for s,

s = s1 + is2 ,  = 1 + i2 ,  = 1 + i2 .

to prove the duality of (32) we rst note that the last term in the la-

grangian can be written as

re tr [ i(  i) ] = tr(2 + 1) .

if the eld  transforms by fractional transformation and the is and the
gauge elds are real this is the u(1)n maxwell action, with the gauge elds
interacting with the scalar eld , and this term by itself has the correct
transformation properties under the duality group [3]. similarly for hermitian
,  and i this term by itself satises equation (11). it follows that the rest
of the lagrangian must be duality invariant. the duality transformations of
the scalar and auxiliary elds are

s = (as + b)(cs + d)1,
 = (a + b)(c + d)1,
 = (c + d)(cs + d).

(35)

(36)

(37)

to show the invariance of tr[i(  s)] it is convenient to rewrite (35) as

s = (cs + d)(as + b).

the proof of invariance of the remaining term which can be written as

re tr [

i
2

s2] = tr [

1
2

2s2] ,

12

is straightforward using the following transformations obtained from (35),
(36) and (37)

s2 = (cs + d)s2(cs + d)1,
2 = (c + d)2(c + d)1,
 = (cs + d)(c + d) .

(38)

the lagrangian has also a discrete parity symmetry which acts on the

elds as

 =  ,
 =   ,
s =  s ,
 =  ,
 =  .

(39)

although the theory of duality invariance presented in the previous sec-
tion guarantees that this theory is self-dual, one can also check directly that
the equations of motion obtained by varying the auxiliary elds are preserved
under duality rotations. these equations of motion are

l 
l 

1
2

l
t = i( 
l
t = i(  s  is22) = 0 ,

s2 +   i) = 0 ,

(40)

(41)

and indeed these two equations form a multiplet under duality transforma-
tions. using the explicit forms (40) and (41) one can check that

l = (c + d)l + l(c + d) + lc ,
l = (sc + d)l  l(c + d) .

alternatively, one can obtain these equations directly from (13).

13

4 elimination of the auxiliary fields

in this section we study the equation of motion (40) and attempt to solve
for . we conjecture the form the lagrangian assumes after the elimination
of the auxiliary elds. this form is a generalization of the well-known born-
infeld lagrangian to more than one gauge eld.

using the equation of motion (40) in the lagrangian (32) we obtain

l = re tr [is] = tr [ s21 + s12 ] ,

(42)

where  is now a function of ,  and s2 that solves (40). for n = 1 we have
to solve a second order algebraic equation and we obtain

1 q1 + 2s2  s2

22

s2

 =

+ i .

apart from the fact that the gauge elds are complex the result is the born-
infeld lagrangian

l = 1 q1 + 2s2  s2

22 + s1 .

(43)

in fact, for n = 1 we could have taken the gauge elds to be real even in the
formulation with auxiliary elds as in [13], in which case the duality group
becomes the sp(2, ir) subgroup of u(1, 1) obtained by requiring a, b, c and
d to satisfy (16) and to be real.

we now study equation (40) for arbitrary n. first notice that (40) can

be simplied with the following eld redenitions

b = rr ,
b = rr ,
b = rr ,

(44)

(45)

where, as in (18), rr = s2. the equation of motion for  is then equivalent
to

1

b 

2bb + b  ib = 0 .

14

breaking this equation into its hermitian and antihermitian parts we nd

it is convenient to dene

1
2

b2 = b ,
1  2b + b2 + i[b,b1]) .
(b2
b1 =
x = 1  b1 .

(46)

(47)

then (47) is equivalent to the quadratic equation for the hermitian matrix x

in terms of x the lagrangian (32) takes the form

x 2 = 1 + 2b  b2 + i[b, x] .

l = tr [ 1  x + s1] ,

(48)

(49)

where here x is now a function of b and b that satises (48).

for n = 1 the equation (48) can be solved trivially since it is a second
order algebraic equation. for arbitrary n, it becomes a matrix equations
whose closed form solution does not seem to be known. however we solved

for x as a power series in b and b
x = xm0

1
m!

x m .

(50)

here m refers to the combined power of b and b in each term. then x can

be solved perturbatively using the recursion relation obtained from (48)

x 0 = 1 , x 1 = b , x 2 = b2  b2 + i[b,b] ,
j  x jx mj + i m [b, x m1] .

2x m = 

m1xj=1

 m > 2 ,

(51)

the initial condition for the recursion relation x 0 = 1 guarantees that the
lagrangian has a physical weak eld limit. we have not been able to solve
explicitly the recursion relation (51) and obtain x to all orders. however, to
obtain the action only tr [x] is needed.

it was conjectured in [11] and checked up to the sixth order that inserting

the solution of (48) into (32) gives the following lagrangian

l = tr [ 1  sb,bq1 + 2b  b2 + s1 ] .

the symmetrizer sb,b acts by symmetrizing each monomial with respect to

linear operator which maps a monomial of order m in b and b into 1/m! times
let pr,s(b, b) be the symmetric polynomial of order r in b and of order s
in b. it is the sum of all the (r+s
r of the letters are b and s of the letters are b . we can write the following
explicit formula for pr,s(b, b)
pr,s(b, b) =

r ) dierent words of length r + s for which

(b + b)r+s .

here  and  are commuting variables. let m rs be an arbitrary monomial

(53)

r!s!  

!r  
!s

with unit coecient of order r in b and of order s in b . then the symmetrizer

acts on m rs as follows

the explicit form of the symmetrized square root term appearing in the
lagrangian is given by

sb,bq1 + 2b  b2 = xr,s0

where (3)!! = 1 , (1)!! = 1 .

(1)(r+1) (2r + 2s  3)!! (2s)!

2s (r + 2s)! s!

pr,2s(b, b) ,

cto avoid confusion, we remark here that the nonabelian born-infeld lagrangian in-
troduced in [22, 23] also involves a symmetrized trace. however, while in [22, 23] the

symmetrization is in the nonabelian eld strength here the symmetrization is in b and b.

sb,b(m rs) =

r + s

pr,s(b, b) .

(54)

the conjecture (52) can be sharpened by stating that the solution x =

c (x) = sb,bq1 + 2b  b2 ,

(55)

x(b, b) of equation (48) satises
where c is the cyclic average operator dened as follows: c is a linear op-
erator and it maps a monomial of order m in b and b to 1/m times the
polynomial obtained by summing all m cyclic permutations of the mono-
mial. the normalization of c guarantees that c  c = c and also tr c = tr .
notice that the nontrivial statement in (55) is c(x) = sb,b (x) , that is the

cyclic average of x is a completely symmetrized quantity. using the sharper
conjecture (55) it is straighforward to see that the lagrangian (49)

l = tr [ 1  x + s1 ] = tr [ 1  c(x) + s1 ]

takes the form (52). we have no general analytic proof of (55) but we have

checked it up to order seventeen for arbitrary noncommuting variables b and
b using the mathematica computer program. in the appendix we present

an alternative expansion, which is equivalent to (51), and which is more
convenient for checking the conjecture (55) order by order by hand and by
computer.

5 real eld strengths

we now show that our results imply the existence of a born-infeld theory with
n real eld strengths which is duality invariant under the maximal duality
group sp(2n, ir).

we rst study the case without scalar elds, i.e. s1 = 0 and s2 = r = 1.
consider a lagrangian l = l(, ) which describes a self-dual theory with
complex gauge elds. we will assume that the lagrangian is a sum of traces
(or of products of traces) of monomials in  and  .
it follows that this
lagrangian satises the self-duality equations (30). this remains true in the
special case that  and  are real. that is l = l(, ) satises the self-
duality equation (30) with  = t =  and  = t = . we now recall

17

that equation (30) is also the self-duality condition for lagrangians with real
gauge elds provided that  and  are dened in the following way

ab =

1
4

f a
r f b

r , ab =

r f b
r ,

1

4 ef a

(56)

where f a
r denotes a real eld strength. this implies that the theory described
by the lagrangian lr = l((f a
r )) is self-dual with duality group
u(n), the maximal compact subgroup of sp(2n, ir). the duality group can
be extended to the full noncompact sp(2n, ir), the maximal duality group of
n real eld strengths [3], by introducing the scalar elds s via the prescription
(17) which also applies to the real case provided s is symmetric [21].

r ), (f a

the solution of (48), denes a duality invariant theory because it is obtained
from the lagrangian with auxiliary elds (32) that is explicitly self-dual.

in our case the lagrangian l = tr [1 x(b, b) + s1] , where x(b, b) is
therefore lr = tr [1  x(b, b) + s1] with the eld strengths taken real is

also self-dual. using the conjecture (55) we obtain an explicit formula for
the born-infeld lagrangian with real gauge elds describing an sp(2n, ir)
duality invariant theory

lr = tr [ 1  sb,bq1 + 2b  b2 + s1 ] .

6 supersymmetric theory

in this section we briey discuss supersymmetric versions of some of the
lagrangians introduced. first we discuss the supersymmetric form of the
2 ) and v a =
lagrangian (32). consider the superelds v a = 12
12(v a

2 are real vector superelds, and dene

2 ) where v a

1 and v a

(v a

1 + iv a

1  iv a

w a

 = 

1
4

d2dv a ,

w a

 = 

1
4

d2d v a .

both w a and w a are chiral superelds and can be used to construct a matrix
of chiral superelds

mab  w a w b .

18

the supersymmetric version of the lagrangian (32) is then given by

l = rez d2(cid:20)tr (i(  s) 

i
2

 d2(s2)  im)(cid:21) ,

(57)

where s,  and  denote chiral superelds with the same symmetry prop-
erties as their corresponding bosonic elds. while the bosonic elds s and
 appearing in (32) are the lowest component of the superelds denoted by
the same letter, the eld  in the action (32) is the highest component of
the supereld . a supersymmetric kinetic term for the scalar eld s can be
written using the kahler potential (34) as described in [24].

just as in the bosonic born-infeld, one would like to eliminate the aux-
iliary elds. however we have not been able to do this exactly except for
n = 1, and unlike the bosonic case we do not even have a conjectured form of
the lagrangian without auxiliary elds. for n = 1 just as in the bosonic case
the theory with auxiliary elds also admits both a real and a complex version,
i.e. we can also consider a lagrangian with a single real supereld. then
we can integrate out the auxiliary superelds and obtain the supersymmetric
version of (52)

l =z d4

2w 2 w 2
s2

1  a + 1  2a + b2

+ re(cid:20)z d2(

i
2

sw 2)(cid:21) ,

(58)

where

a =

1
4

(d2(s2w 2) + d2(s2 w 2)) , b =

1
4

(d2(s2w 2)  d2(s2 w 2)) .

if we only want a u(1) duality invariance we can set s = i and then
the action (58) reduces to the supersymmetric born-infeld action described
in [14, 15, 16].

in the case of weak elds the rst term of (58) can be neglected and the
lagrangian is quadratic in the eld strengths. under these conditions the
combined requirements of supersymmetry and self duality can be used [25]
to constrain the form of the weak coupling limit of the eective lagrangian
from string theory.

19

7 extension to arbitrary even dimensions

in a space-time of arbitrary even dimension, d = 2p we dene the matrices

ab =

1
p!

f a

1...p

f b 1...p , ab =

1
p!

f a

1...p

f b 1...p ,

(59)

where f a
eld strength is given by

1...p = 1/p! 1...p1...pf a 1...p is the hodge dual of f a. the dual

ga
1...p  p!

l

 f a 1...p

, g

a

1...p  p!

l

f a 1...p

.

since eef = (1)p+1f and f g = (1)pf g, for all even dimensions the matrix

 is hermitian, while  is hermitian if d = 4 and anti-hermitian if d =
4 + 2. it is also convenient to dene

n =

  i ,
 +  ,

if d = 4 ,
if d = 4 + 2 .

with these denitions the lagrangian (32) gives a u(n, n) duality invariant
theory in arbitrary even dimensions.

however, if the dimension of space-time is d = 4 + 2, where  is integer

it is convenient to make the following eld redenitions

 = i , s = is .

the new elds have the decomposition

 = 1 + 2 , s = s1 + s2 ,

where 1 and s1 are hermitian and 2 and s2 are anti-hermitian. the minus
sign was introduced so that we have

s1 = s2 .

(60)

then s1 is positive denite and we can write s1 = rr with r an arbitrary
nonsingular n-dimensional matrix.

20

we also perform a similarity transformation on the u(n, n) duality group,
such that the transformation properties of the new elds simplify. let us
dene two 2n-dimensional matrices with the block form

and let the matrices t and m have the block decomposition

ik =
m =

0 1

1 0  ,
ih =
c d  , t =

a b

0 1

1 0  ,
c d  .

a b

then one can dene the u(n, n) group as the group of matrices satisfying
either one of the two relations

m ik m = ik , t ih t  = ih .

(61)

the two denitions are related by a unitary transformation m = u1tu
where

the n-dimensional matrices a, b, c and d satisfy

ad + cb = 1 , ca + ac = 0 , bd + db = 0 .

(63)

the action of u(n, n) on the scalar elds is given by

s = (as + b)(cs + d)1 ,
 = (a + b)(c + d)1 ,
 = (c + d)(cs + d) .

(64)

note that the positivity of s1 is compatible with the above transformation
law of s.

the lagrangian, written in terms of the redened elds, takes the form

l = re(cid:20)tr ((  s) 

1
2

s1 + n )(cid:21) .

(65)

21

u =

ei/4

0

0

ei/4  .

(62)

our conjecture regarding the lagrangian without auxiliary elds is indepen-
dent of the dimension of space-time and if it holds we can eliminate the
auxiliary elds to obtain the lagrangian

l = tr [ 1  sb,bq1 + 2b + b2 + s2 ] ,

where

(66)

(67)

b = rr ,
b = rr .

note also that s2 appears in the last term of the lagrangian (66), and this
is consistent with s2 and  being anti-hermitian in space-times of odd half
dimension. also, there is a change of sign in front of the 2 term under the
square root in (66) due to the change in the denition of n .

if the half-dimension of space-time is odd it is consistent to take all the
elds to be real in either the lagrangian with auxiliary elds (65), or in
the lagrangian (66) where the auxiliary elds have been eliminated. then
we obtain a theory invariant under an o(n, n) duality group. it was shown
in [17, 21] that the maximal connected duality group for a theory of dimen-
sion d = 4 + 2 with n antisymmetric tensors is so(n, n). in the analysis
of [17, 21] only innitesimal duality transformations were considered, and
from these one can only show duality under the connected component of the
group. in [19, 20] the group o(n, n) was considered. note that, as discussed
in appendix b, o(n, n) has four disjoint components embedded in u(n, n)
which is a connected group. finally, one can also obtain a theory invariant
under the o(n)  o(n) maximal compact subgroup of o(n, n) by setting
s = 1 in the lagrangian (66).

appendix a

in this appendix we discuss an equivalent expansion of the lagrangian (42)
which simplies the order by order check of the conjecture. we set s = i for
simplicity, since s can always be reintroduced via the prescription (17). the
expansion is in terms of the variables p and q dened as

p  

1
2

(  i) , q  

1
2

( + i) .

(68)

note that the self-duality equation (30) simplies when written in terms of
p and q

p  lp plp = q  lq q lq .

(69)

next we describe the perturbative expression of x. let us dene

 = 2p ,  = 2q .

then the equations of motion (40) for  and its hermitian conjugate become

p = p q + p , q = p q + q .

it is convenient to consider the following expansions

we then have

p =xn

pn , q =xn

qn ,

p0 = q0 = 0 , p1 = p , q1 = q

23

and we can solve for pn recursively

pn =

n1xr=1

prqnr .

(70)

notice that since    = 2i , for n > 1, pn = qn . therefore we have
p0 = 0 , p1 = p , p2 = pq and, for all n > 2 ,

pn = ppn1 + pn1q +

n2xr=2

prpnr .

(71)

we also have pn =  1
as

2 n! x n for all n > 1. the lagrangian is now expressed

l = re tr  = re tr [ 2xn

pn] = tr [ p + q + 2xn2

pn ] .

using (53) and the linear change of variables (68) one can prove that
symmetrization with respect to  and  is equivalent to symmetrization
with respect to p and q. then we can rewrite the conjectured symmetrized
square root lagrangian as

l = tr[1  sp,qq1  2(p + q) + (p  q)2 ] .

(72)

we believe the explicit power series expansion of the square root in p

and q has the simple expression

sp,qq1  2(p + q) + (p  q)2 = 1 p q 2 xr,s1

1

r + s

r + s  2

r  1  pr,s(p, q) ,

which has been checked up to order twenty in p and q with the mathematica
computer program. using the above expansion we can rewrite the conjec-
ture (55) in the p and q variables

c 1  p  q  2xn2

pn = 1  p  q  2 xr,s1

1

r + s

r + s  2

r  1  pr,s(p, q) .

it is this form that has been checked up to order seventeen by computer.

24

appendix b

in this appendix we show that the eld s provides a global parametrization
of the coset space g/h where g is u(n, n), sp(2n, ir) or o(n, n) and h is
the maximal compact subgroup of g. we will concentrate on u(n, n) but
the same argument applies for the other groups.

cosets are equivalence classes of group elements g of g under right mul-

tiplication with arbitrary elements h of h

g  gh .

we denote the coset containing g by gh. the maximal compact subgroup
of g is dened as

h  {h  g| hh = hh = 1} .

it is the intersection of u(n, n) with u(2n) i.e. u(n)  u(n).

next consider the map  : g/h  c dened by

(gh) = gg ,

where

c = {s  g| s = s, s positive denite}

is the subset of hermitian positive denite group elements of g. this map is
well dened since for any two elements g and g in the same coset, g = gh
and gg = ghhg = gg. furthermore this map is one to one. we show rst
that the map is surjective. let s be an arbitrary hermitian positive denite
element of g. then

s =

a b

c d  =

1 bd1
0

1 

d 0
0

d 

0

1

d1c 1  .

(73)

the last equality in (73) can be checked using the group relations (16). the
decomposition exists whenever d is invertible, but since s is positive denite
and d is the restriction of s on an n-dimensional subspace d is also positive

25

denite. note also that d = d and (bd1) = bd1 = d1c. then g dened
as

g =

1 bd1
0

1 

d1/2

0

d1/2 

satises s = gg, thus the map  is surjective. to show that the map is
also injective note that gg = gg is equivalent to g1g(g1g) = 1. then
h = g1g is an element of g satisfying hh = 1, that is it belongs to the
maximal compact subgroup h and we have g = gh so g and g belong to the
same coset.

if we dene s2 = d1 and s1 = bd1 we can rewrite (73) as

this decomposition can also be written in terms of s2 and s = s1 + is2 as

s = i

s2
0
0 s1

2

0 1

1 s1
0

s =
1 
1 0  +
s =

0 s

c d  s

a b



s1

s1 1  .


0

a b

c d 

.

left multiplication on the group g induces an action of the group g on the
coset space

0 0

s 1  .

(74)

using the decomposition (74) one can easily show that the fractional transfor-
mation (19) of s is equivalent to this action. the form (74) is very convenient
since the rst term is invariant under the action, while the second term only
contains s and s2 and these have the simple transformation properties (19)
and (21).

if we make all the matrices above real we obtain the parametrizations of
sp(2n, ir)/u(n). if we change the basis with the unitary matrix u dened
in (62) and then require all the matrices to be real we obtain the coset space
o(n, n)/o(n)  o(n).

since the map  is injective we see that s, such that s2 is positive def-
inite, is a global coordinate on the coset space u(n, n)/u(n)  u(n). thus

26

this coset space is connected. the group u(n, n) is a principal bundle over
u(n, n)/u(n) u(n) with a u(n) u(n) ber. the number of disconnected
components of a principal bundle with a connected base is at most equal
to the number of components of the ber which in this case is one. thus
u(n, n) is connected. using the same argument one can show that sp(2n, ir)
is connected while o(n, n) has at most four components. by an argument
similar to the one used for the lorentz group one can show that there are at
least four components. thus, as mentioned in section 7, o(n, n) has exactly
four components.
