abstract

it is shown that a moyal deformation quantization of the so(4k) generalized yang-mills (gym) theory
action in d = 4k dimensions, for spacetime independent eld congurations, in the h  0 limit, yields
the dirac-nambu-goto p-brane actions ( obtained from the conformally invariant dolan-tchrakian p-brane
actions after elimination of the auxiliary world volume metrics) , in the orthonormal gauge, for p + 1 = 4k
world volumes embedded in a d = 4k target spacetime background. the gauge elds/target spacetime
coordinates correspondence is required but no large n limit is necessary. the equivalence between moyal
sdym and self dual p-branes is obtained without choosing the orthonormal gauge.

i. introduction

recently, conformally invariant sigma models in d = 2n dimensions with target non-compact o(2n, 1)
groups were studied.
instanton eld congurations were found to correspond geometrically to conformal
 stereographic mappings of r2n into euclidean signature ads2n spaces [1]. these conformally invariant
sigma models [2] were of crucial importance in the construction of conformally invariant lagrangians, with
vanishing world volume cosmological constant, for bosonic p-branes, such that p + 1 = 2n [3].

closely related to these conformally invariant sigma models are the so(4k) generalized yang mills
theories (gym) in r4k constructed by tchrakian [4]. hierachies of gauged grassmanian models in 4k
dimensions with self dual instantons were also constructed by tchrakian and manvelyan [4].

nahm equations are directly connected with self dual yang mills equations. moyal deformation quan-
tization of nahm equations, and the toda models in the n   limit, were constructed in [5] and solutions
were found in [6] in relation to matrix models and m theory. deformation quantization has recently captured
a lot of interest in string theory and for this reason we will cosntruct the moyal deformation quantization
of tchrakian so(4k) gym in r4k and show that in the h  0 limit, and for spacetime independent eld
congurations, one will p-brane actions, in the orthonormal gauge, for p-branes, p + 1 = 4k, moving in target
spacetime backgrounds of dimensionality equal to 4k.

fairlie [6] has emphasized the importance of the large n limit of su (n ) yang-mills theory , for spacetime
independent eld conguartions, in connection with the schild string action. fairlie has raised the interesting
issue that a possible extension of the large n limit to dirac-born-infeld actions, d-branes eective actions.
may also exist. this would pave the road, in a very natural fashion, to a deformation quantization program
to d-branes based on dirac-born-infeld actions.

the standard work on deformation quantization was initiated by [7,8,9]. for the role of fedosov
deformation quantization in w geometry [10]; on the connection between holography and the quantum
geometry of surfaces with moyal quantization see [11]. the importance of w symmetry in the moyal
quantization process was studied in [12]. for recent results on d-branes and deformation quantization and
an extensive list of current references on star products and string theory see [13]. a rigorous mathematical
foundation is given in [14] and a path integral expression of kontsevich quantization was presented in [15].
finally, deformation quantization of coadjoint orbits in semisimple groups we refer to [16]. geometric
induced actions for w gravity, an anomalous eective wznw action, based on a coadjoint orbit method
associated with the moyal deformations of the algebra of dierential operators of the circle was given by
nissimov, pacheva and vaysburd [16].

we start with a few denitions of gym in the next section before performing the moyal quantization that
will allow us to show its relation to the construction of p-brane actions. finally we present our conclusions.

the generalized yang mills theory (gym) described by tchrakian [4] based on so(4k) in rd where

d = 4k has for dening lagrangian :

l =

tr (f 12......n

tr (f2  f2......f2)2.

g is a dimensionless coupling constant and

12.......2k = [12 34.......2k1 2k].

is the totally antisymmetrized product of k factors of the 22k1  22k1 matrices  corresponding to the
chiral representation of so(4k). for k = 1 one has the usual so(4)  so(3)  so(3) , whose double cover
is su (2)  su (2) :

a moyal deformation quantization of the so(4k) gym assigns a one-to-one map of the self-adjoint
tensor-valued operators, f1.....2k , belonging to the hilbert space of square integrable functions, l2(r2k),
to the c-number tensor-valued functions of the phase space r4k coordinates. the deformation quantization
also assigns a one-to-one map from the commutators of self-adjoint operators [ a, b] to the moyal brackets
{{a, b}} where a = symbol[ a] and b = symbol[ b]. the symbol of a self-adjoint operator a, which assigns
a c-number function of phase space, is dened via the weyl groenewold wigner moyal map (wwgm) [7] :

a(x, q1, p1, .....q2k, p2k)  z d2k < ~q 

~
2| a(x)|~q +

~
2

> e

i~p.~
h .

(6)

in order to evaluate the matrix elements of integrand of (6) one needs to know the representation of the
so(4k) algebra in the hilbert space l2(r2k). due to the fact that the eld strength (1) is given in terms
of antisymmetrized products of su (2) matrices and since the representations of su (2) are known, [5], one
can evaluate explicitly such matrix elements. however.
for our purposes at the moment this will not be
necessary. the wwgm map (6) was used by fairlie to construct solutions to the moyal nahm equations
in 3, 7 dimensions.

the wwgm map associated with f12......2k will be the c-number tensor-valued function of the phase

space variables, in addition to the d = 4k spacetime x coordinates, :

from the denition given by (1,2) it can be written as the antisymmetrized product of the k factors of :

f12......2k(x1, x2, .....x4k; q1, p1, .........q2kp2k).

with :

f12......2k = f[12f3 4 ........f2k1 2k].

f = a  a + {{a, a}}..

2

(7)

(8)

(9)

for the particular case of space-time independent eld congurations the above eld strengths become :

f12......2k = {{a1, a2}}  {{a3, a4}}  .......................  {{a2k1 , a2k}}.

(10)

the moyal star product in the r4k phase space is dened as :

a  b =



(

xk=0

ih
2

)k 1
k!

i1j1 i2j2 .....ikjk (i1i2.....ik a)(j1 j2.....jkb).

and the moyal bracket is

{{a, b}} =

1
ih

(a  b  b  a)

(11a)

(11b)

where ij are the components of the inverse tensor of the symplectic two-form ij. in the classical h  0
limit, the moyal bracket reduces to the poisson bracket. the trace over the lie algebra indices is converted,
after the wwgm prescription, into an integral over the f lat phase space coordinates. the relevance of
the moyal quantization, and a subsequent h  0 limit, is that no large n   limit is required in the
associated so(2n ), su (n ) yang mills theories. for example. no    matrices are needed. the h  0
limit will render the poisson bracket area-preserving dis algebra automatically. see garcia-compean et al
[5].

when the phase space is curved the moyal deformation quantization needs to be replaced by a defor-
mation quantization program described by fedosov [9] that takes into account the fact that the ordinary
moyal star product in curved phase space is no longer associative. a geometric derivation of w gravity
from fedosov deformation quantization and the reason why the string coordinates inherit a noncommutative
product structure, among other things, was given in [10].

now, taking into account the special case of independent spacetime eld congurations, the action
associated with the moyal quantization of the so(4k) gym in r4k factorizes into a product of a space-time
volume and an integral over phase space variables. corresponding to the trace over the lie algebra elements
:

4k

g2 z d2kq d2kp [{{a1 , a2}}  {{a3, a4}}  .......................  {{a2k1 , a2k}}]2.

(12)

the classical limit h = 0 of the moyal bracket yields the poisson bracket represented by a single bracket

symbol. hence, in the h = 0 limit the action for the space time independent eld congurations beomes :

4k

g2 z d2kq d2kp [{a1 , a2}  {a3, a4}  .......................  {a2k1 , a2k}]2.

(13)

if one equates the at phase space coordinates, q1, p1, .....q2k, p2k with the coordinates of the 4k-dimensional
world volume of a p-brane such that p + 1 = 4k : 1 = q1, 2 = p1, ....4k1 = q2k, 4k = p2k and establishes
the spacetime independent gauge elds/ coordinate correspondence : a()  1
x() , with lp the planck
length in the appropriate dimension, we will see that the above action (13) is nothing but the dirac-nambu-
goto (dng) action for a p-brane moving in target spacetime backgrounds of dimension 4k, for the values of
p + 1 = 4k in the orthonormal gauge. let us take without loss of generality the case k = 1 associated with
a p = 3-brane whose world volume if four dimensional. the h  0 limit yields in (13) :

l2
p

4
g2l8

p z d4 [{x1, x2}]2 =

4
g2l8

p z d4 i1j1 i2j2 i1 x 1j1 x 2i2 x1 j2 x2 .

(14a)

where ij is the inverse of the symplectic form used to dene the poisson bracket. in a canonical basis it
can be represented by a 4  4 antisymmetric matrix comprised of two block antisymmetric 2  2 matrices
with 1 entries o the diagonal, respectively. the action in (14a) becomes

4
g2l8

p z d4 [([q1 x 1p1]x 2) + ([q2 x 1p2]x 2)]2.

(14b)

3

the conformally invariant dolan-tchrakian action [3] for a p = 3-brane whose world volume is four

dimensional embedded in a four dimensional target spacetime background is :

t z d4 h h11h22[1 x 12]x 2[1x1 2]x2 .

the action is conformal invariant under the transformations of the world volume auxiliary metric :

h12  eh12 . h12  eh12 . h  e2h.

(15)

(16)

as previously said, the moyal quantization requires a at phase space which seems to be incompatible
with the action (15) for arbitrary world volume metrics, h. this can be solved by noticing that the action
(15) is on-shell equivalent to the dirac-nambu-goto actions (dng) upon the elimination of the metric h
and plugging its value back into the action (15) to retrieve the action :

sdn g = t z d4 pdet g. g = x x.

(17)

where g is the induced world volume metric as a result og the embedding of the p = 3-brane into the
target spacetime background. to verify this result the authors [3] have shown that the algebraic elimination
of h yields one physical solution given by :

(18)
and , as expected, the action (15) density for the solutions of h becomes proportional to the g. the
second solution [3] was disregarded on physical grounds. we have seen then how the on-shell world volume
metric h is in the same conformal class to the embedding metric g.

w1g = h. h = w2g.

if one goes ahead and xes now the 4-dimensional ( euclidean) world volume reparametrization invari-
ance of the dng action ( obtained after the elimination of the auxiliary metric) by choosing the analog of
the orthonormal gauge in the dirac-nambu-goto string ( for euclidean world sheets) :

(x )( x) = . ,  = 1, 2, 3, 4.

(19)

one arrives at the conclusion that the on-shell solutions to the auxiliary world volume metric, in the or-
thonormal gauge, are given by conformally at (euclidean) metrics : h12 = e12 where 12 is the
(euclidean) four dimensional world volume metric. the above action (15) becomes nally :

t z d4 11 22 [1x 12]x 2[1x1 2]x2 = t z d4 [[1x 1 2]x 2]2  t z d4

(20)

the lagrangian density of (20) becomes a constant, as it should, since in the orthonormal gauge (19) the
measure density in the dng action (17) becomes equal to 1. this is indeed compatible with choosing a at
phase space and in equating it with the world volume of the p = 3-brane.

similar arguments follow with eqs-(14a, 14b), after making the identication : 1 = q1, 2 = p1, 3 =
q2, 4 = p2, the lagrangian density in (14b) also becomes a constant after using the orthonormal gauge
conditions of eq-(19). the fact that one can gauge the lagrangian density to a constant is related to the fact
that a p-brane moving in a background of d = p + 1 = 4k dimensions does not have local transverse degrees
of freedom : dp1 = 0. in that sense the theory is topological. before continuing, we must emphasize that
the action (14) is not the schild action because the latter is the action for a string, a two-dim world sheet,
whereas the action in (14) is truly a four-dim one. the schild action is area-preserving dieomorphisms
invariant but it is not fully reparametrization invariant like the dolan-tchrakian p-brane actions.

when the target spacetime dimension is saturated, d = p + 1 = 4k, the dng action becomes trivial :

sdn g = t z d4

(x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4)

(1.2, 3, 4)

.

(21)

4

where the measure of integration is simply the jacobian of the change of variables from x  to i. a trivial
solution to the orthonormal gauge conditions (19) is given by :

x 1 = 1. x 2 = 2. x 3 = 3. x 4 = 4.

(22)

which renders the jacobian equal to unity and this is compatible with the atness of the phase space. a
curved phase space description requires a fedosov deformation quantization as stated earlier.

therefore, to sum up, the action (14) obtained from a moyal deformation quantization of a so(4) yang
mills theory in r4, in the h  0 limit, for spacetime independent eld congurations, is equivalent to
dng actions ( obtained from the dolan-tchrakian action (15) after the elimination of the auxiliary world
volume metric h) , in the orthonormal gauge, if, and only if, one equates the p = 3-brane tension ( up to
a numerical factor) to :

t3 

4
g2l8
p

.

(23)

4 is the four dimensional spacetime volume of r4 where the so(4) yang mills theory is dened. to
regularize quantities like the volume we could select a compact spacetime.

it is important to emphasize that x 6= x. the base manifold coordinates over which one denes
the so(4k) gym must not be confused with the target spacetime embedding coordinates of the p-brane
(p + 1 = 4k). the gauge elds a, after the moyal quantization and the h = 0 limit, are the ones that
behave like the p-brane coordinates. in general, the p-brane tension, where p + 1 = 4k, up to a k-dependent
numerical constant, is then :

tp 

4k
g2l8k
p

.

(24)

and the moyal deformation quantization of the so(4k) generalized yang mills theory (gym), for spacetime
independent eld congurations, in the h  0 limit, is :

4k
g2l8k

p z d4k [{x1 , x2}  {x3, x4}  .......................  {x2k1 , x2k}]2.

(25)

similar arguments as the k = 1 case will allow us to show that the action given by (25) will be equivalent
to the dng actions ( after the elimination of the world volume metrics from the dolan tchrakian p-brane
action) , with p + 1 = 4k, moving in target spacetime backgrounds of d = 4k, in the orthonormal gauge
(19), where the world volume and spacetime indices now run over 4k values :

t z d4k h h11 h22........h4k 4k [1x 12 x 2.....4k ]x 4k [1x1 2x2 .....4k]x4k .

(26)

another less restrictive alternative to the one presented above is to ask under what conditions one has

in the p + 1 = 4 = d case :

z x()

[{a, a}]2  z ijklix 1jx 2kx 3lx 4  t z d4 (ei1  ei2 )  (ej1  ej2 )i1j1 i2j2

(27)

where one has written the dolan-tchrakian action purely in geometric terms given by the pullback of the
orthonormal one-forms for the background 4 spacetime onto the 4-dim world volume . the hodge dual star
operation is given in terms of the world volume metric h. it is precisely in the star operation where the
metric is encoded. one is summing over all possible 6 pairs ,  of indices in the l.h.s. both sides of eq-(27)
admits a natural 4k = p + 1 extension [3] given by eqs-(25,26).

since every symplectic manifold can be equipped with an almost complex structure, j, the metric tensor
dened by : g(x, y ) = (j x, y ) for all vector elds, x, y , is a riemannian metric on the symplectic
manifold. one can then use the gauge elds/coordinates and symplectic form/metric correspondence :

5

adx  edx. ij  h.

(28)

and ask now : under what conditions the integrated measure of (14), given by the l.h.s of (27) for arbitrary
ij, is proportional to the integrated jacobian of the x   i transformation ?; i.e. under what conditions,
the moyal deformation quantization of a so(4) gym in r4, in the h = 0 limit, for spacetime independent
eld congurations, yields the dolan-tchrakian actions without having to x the orthonormal gauge and
without having to eliminate the metric h via its algebraic equations of motion ? it is desirable not to have
to impose any gauge conditions at all, and eliminate the h via its equations of motion, in order to render
the action densities of eq-(27) to a constant and to establish their equivalence. moreover we wish now to
look at the full integrals instead of their densities.

the answer is in the armative in the special case of moyal deformations of the self dual yang mills
sector and the corresponding self dual p-branes. the action of dolan and tchrakian when written in terms
of one-forms has precisely the same form of a typical of ym ( generalized ym) theory f  f . self dual
solutions f = f solve automatically the ym (gym) equations of motion due to the bianchi identities and
yield topological invariants r f  f ; i.e the winding number.

on the r.h.s of the equation (27) a self dual p-brane, when the target embedding spacetime dimension
is saturated, d = p + 1 = 4k turns out to be essentially topological in the sense that it does not posess local
degrees of freedom. when e  e = (e  e) one can see in (27) that the dolan-tchrakian action becomes
the integral of the jacobian of the change of variables : x   giving nally an integrated volume. notice
once again, that the metric h is naturally encoded in the hodge dual star operation. there is no need to
eliminate it.

how can a volume be a topological invariant ? one can have an innite family of closed p-branes with
xed topology but arbitrary volumes. the answer lies in the fact that it is well known (to the experts) that
p-branes are essentially gauge theories of volume preserving dis. for example, su(), w, w1+ are the
classical area-preserving dis algebras of a sphere, plane, cylinder respectively. the topology of the two-dim
surfaces is clearly sensitive to the type of innite-dim lie algebras involved. hence, it is in this context of
gauge theories of volume preserving dis that there is an exact equivalence between moyal deformations of
sdym ( sd generalized ym), in the h = 0 limit, for spacetime independent eld congurations, to the
self dual p-branes. this occurs without imposing any gauge conditions whatsoever nor eliminating the
world volume metrics ! in this integrable sector of self dual p-branes and self dual gym (instantons) the
equivalence provided by the moyal deformation quantization is exact. this is basically the second main
result.

conclusions

after showing the equivalence of the moyal deformation quantization of the gym and p-branes, under
certain special conditions, spacetime independent eld congurations, h = 0 limit....it is worth exploring
other cases besides the d = 4k. in particular, the deformation quantization of nambu-poisson mechanics
associated with general pbranes has been studied by dito et al [17]. p-brane quantum mechanical wave
equations have been given in [18].
the role of w geometry [10], and the extension of the vertex operator algebras to w conformal
field theory, in connection with higher spin theories in ads backgrounds and n = 8 higher spin super-
gravity, the eld theory limit of m theory on ads4  s7, deserves further attention [19.20]. the p-brane
tensions appearing in this work have a typical stringy instanton behaviour 1
g2 . it is warranted to study how
d-branes t in this formalism of moyal-fedosov deformation quantization. the d-brane tensions have a
1
g behaviour. the wznw actions associated with open-strings in group manifolds with an antisymmetric
rank two tensor background, and dirac-born-infeld eective actions discussed in [6,13] should be a starting
point.

finally, more general cases ought to be investigated other than the restricted spacetime independent
eld congurations; the fact that the number of spacetime dimensions 4k equals that of the phase space
variables suggests a complexif ication of the 4k-world volume coordinates and background spacetime and,
correspondingly, of the gauge elds. this deserves to be studied in the future, especially in relation to the
role that symplectic and complex geometry plays in the theory of branes. fedosov deformation quantization

6

and the generalizations of w geometry [10] will then be an essential ingredient for more general curved
phase spaces.
