bosonic structure of a 2-dimensional fermion model

with interaction among dierent species ii

 n -species case 

jiro sakamoto) and yasuaki fukuoka

physics department, shimane university, matsue 690-8504, japan

we study a massive thirring-like model in 2-dimensional space-time, which contains
fermions with arbitrary number (n ) of dierent species. this model is an extension of that
of a previous paper, where we have considered two-species case. by this extension we expect
that we can expose more general structures of this kind of model. we obtain the equivalent
boson model with n species to our fermion model. we nd that the coupling constant must
be set in some regions in order for the model to be physically sensible. it seems hard to
nd such regions from direct obsavation of the original fermion model. we also nd that for
specic values of the coupling constant some of the boson elds disappear from the system.
therefore, the n -species fermion model is described by the boson model with fewer species.

1.

introduction

the bosonization technique is one of the powerful approaches to study a 2-
dimensional fermion system. 1) as coleman has done in his pioneering work, 2) with
this technique one can expose hidden properties of such a fermion system though it
may be applicable only for charge-zero sectors of fermions, i.e. for sectors of pairs of
fermion and anti-fermion. in a previous paper 3) (i) using the path-integral method
we have derived an equivalent boson model to a two-species fermion model with
interaction only among dierent species. we have found that in order for the model
to be physically sensible the coupling constant must be set in some regions. we
alse found that for a specic value of the coupling constant g = 2/3 one boson is
decoupled from the system and that the two-species fermion system can be described
by the one-species boson model, i.e. the ordinary sine-gordon model.

in this article we consider the bosonization of the n -species fermion model,
which is a direct extension of the model in i. it is an easier but non-trivial extension
of the freedom of the bosonization technique. by this extension we expect that we
can expose more general structures of this model. as is shown below, we derive the
n -species equivalent boson model and nd that the coupling constant g must be in
the regions g < /(n  1), 2/3(n  1)  g  2/3 or g >  in order for this
boson model to be physically sensible. the region corresponding to the second one
was missed in i. we also nd that for specic values of the coupling constant some
bosons are decoupled from the system, i.e. one or n  1 bosons are decoupled for
g = 2/3(n 1) or g = 2/3, respectively. therefore, the n -species fermion model
is equivalent to (n  1)-species boson model for the former case and to one-species
boson model for the latter case.

we use the same notations as in i, i.e. in minkowski space-time, g = (1, +1)
and 01 = 01 = 1. gamma-matrices are given as 0 = 0 = ix, 1 = 1 = y,
5 = 01 = z, where x, y and z are the pauli matrices.

2. model

our initial lagrangian is given by

l =

n

xi=1

i(/  m)i +

n

xi>j=1

1
2

gjij
j ,

where i, j denote the fermion species and

ji = iii.

(2.1)

(2.2)

in (2.1) a fermion interacts with those of the dierent species and never with itself
directly. when n = 2, we can change the sign of g by taking charge conjugation
of one of the fermion species. in fact we saw in i that the consequences for n = 2
are symmetric for g  g. on the contrary, for the case n  3, there is not such a
symmetry, and therefore the sign of g has a physical meaning for this case.

the quartic interaction part in (2.1) is rewritten as

n

xi>j=1

1
2

gjij

j =

g

4 xi

ji!2



g

4 xi

and this is equivalent to

jix  

g

xx  +

g

2 xi

g

2 xi (cid:18) 1

ai  ji(cid:19) a

i ,

with using auxiliary vector elds x and ai. now we put

bi = x  ai,

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

and integrate out over x by the path-integral formulation to obtain

jib

i 

g

2 xi

g

4(n  1)  xi

bi!2

g

(bi)2 .

(2.6)

here we should note that for n  3 the above expression contains direct coupling
among the same species of boson elds bi while fermion elds do not interact
directly with themselves in the original lagrangian (2.1).

in 2-dimensional space-time, we can write vector elds bi with two scalar elds

i and i as

bi =  i + i.

with these scalar elds we transform the fermion elds as

i  

i = exp(cid:26) ig

2

(5i + i)(cid:27) i,

(2.7)

(2.8)

to rewrite the lagrangian as

le = xi

(2.9)

in the above expression the term (g2/4)()2 comes from det| exp(ig5i)| in the
path-integral measure following fujikawa. 4) it is seen that i is decoupled from the
other elds and can be integrated out. then we obtain

le = xi

where we write i for 
i.

the generating functional of the green functions is given by

z = z yi

dididi exp(cid:26)iz d2xle(cid:27) .

(2.11)

by the wick rotation we transform ourselves into euclidean space-time from the
minkowski space-time. then the generating functional (2.11) is rewritten in eu-
clidean space-time as

ze = z yi

dididi exp{z d2xle}.

(2.12)

3. perturbative expansion

in order to calculate (2.12) by perturbation theory we choose l0 = le (m = 0)
of (2.10) as the free lagrangian. we nd that the free fermion and boson propagators
are given as

di(x)j(y)e =

hi(x)j (y)i =

i,j

  (x  y)
(x  y)2 ,

(3.1)

2g (cid:26)



(g  ){ + g(n  1)}



i,j

g  (cid:27) ln(x  y)22, (3.2)

where <    > denotes the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product.
parameter  is a small infrared cuto mass, which will be set to zero after the
calculations.

now, we calculate ze of (2.12) through the perturbative expansion with respect
to m. we note that all the odd order terms vanish because of traceless property of

4

-matrices and the super selection rule for the boson eld , i.e. < exp ip i >= 0
unless p i = 0 where i = g. 1), 2) the 2n-th order term of the expansion of ze is

given as

z (2n)

e =

using the identity

where we put  = (1  5)/2, we expand (3.3) as

(3.8)

where we have used (3.2). here we suppose that for a small distance the boson
propagator is properly regularized. we nd that each fermion part in (3.7) has the
same combination of the coordinates {xk,i, yk,i} as that in the above expression.

we, therefore, suppose that in the corresponding boson model the free boson
propagator gives such a fermion contribution besides the original boson one (3.2) as

if we choose the renormalization of mass as

then eq.(3.11) is equal to (3.7). from the free boson propagator (3.9) and the

4. discussion

let us calculate the eigenvalues of the coecient matrix {ai,j} of the kinetic

term in the boson lagrangian (3.13), which is given by

ai,j =

g2

2(3g  2) (cid:20)

g

3g(n  1) + 2

+

g  



i,j(cid:21) .

(4.1)

from the equation

we obtain

g2{(n  1)g + }
2{3g(n  1) + 2}
g2(g  )
2(3g  2)

: single root,

: (n  1)degenerated roots.

in order for the boson model (3.13) to be physically sensible, these eigenvalues must
be non-negative, so we have

it is hard to nd such regions (4.5), (4.6) or (4.7) from direct observation of the
fermion model (2.1). in the previous paper i we missed the region corresponding
to (4.6). it seems that even in the outside of the regions (4.5), (4.6) and (4.7), we
can change the sign of the kinetic part in the lagrangian by transforming the elds
into imaginary ones. by such transformation, however, the potential terms become
unbounded from blow. this means that in order to x the physical regions of the
coupling constant we must check both kinetic and potential terms in the lagrangian.
the kinetic terms in the lagrangian (3.13) of the previous paper i look like negative
in the region (4.6), but by scaling the boson eld we can still dene a physically
sensible boson model in this region; see below.

3(n 1) or g = 2

at the specic values g =  2

the eigenvalues (4.3) or (4.4)
3(n 1) one boson eld corresponding to (4.3) disappears from
diverge. when g =  2
the system and the original n -species fermion model is described by (n  1)-species
3 , (n  1)-boson elds corresponding to (4.4) disappear
boson elds, while for g = 2
and the original fermion model is equivalent to the boson model with only one species,
i.e. the ordinary sine-gordon model.

which corresponds to the boson lagrangian in i. as mentioned before, it is seen that
the lagrangian above is invariant for g  g with +  . there does not exist,
however, such a symmetry for the lagrangian (3.13) when n  3.

if  > g > 2/3 or 2/3 > g > , the potential term in (4.10) becomes

(4.11)

which is unbounded from below, and the model is physically nonsensical. then g
must be set in the region (4.5), (4.6) or (4.7) with n = 2.

in our path-integral formulation the massive thirring-like model is described
as the system of massless fermions interacting with massless bosons where the in-
teraction part contains mass parameter. while the bosonization technique may be
applicable only for the charge-zero sectors, it is an interesting subject to study the
charged sectors, i.e. the bound states of some particles in our formulation.
