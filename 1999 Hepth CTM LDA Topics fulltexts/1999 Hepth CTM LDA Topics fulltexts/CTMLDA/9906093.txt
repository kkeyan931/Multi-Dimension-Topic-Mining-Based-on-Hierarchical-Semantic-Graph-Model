(1.1) consider complex spinor wave function fermionic particle carrying electric charge qf . result that, instead, qf 2h z f + 1 2 i(, ) z. (1.2) notice condition, unlike (1.1) special four-manifolds intersection num- ber two-cycles makes sense there. notice also four-manifold m4 possesses two-cycle odd self-intersection number ux must fractional. particular ux cannot vanish. putting qf zero (1.2) yields contradiction. means manifolds cannot support neutral spinors. simplest example this, already known time, m4 complex projective space cp (2) . likewise, m4 possess real (uncharged) spinor wavefunctions two-cycles must even self-intersection number. rst concluded basis totally dierent arguments geroch . converse true. exist four-manifolds, whose two-cycles possess even self-intersection number, support real spinor eld. four four-manifolds feature cannot simply connected. simplest example product two two-spheres divided parity z2 . treatment explains phenomena unied way. uses heavily fea- ture free two-cycles m4 form unimodular lattice permitted uxes related similar lattice (the reciprocal). unimodular lattices possess special elements, known characteristic vectors. components related self-intersection numbers occurring condition (1.2) way explained, based application atiyah-singer index theorem electromagnetic dirac operator m4. unimodularity feature essential ingredient verifying electromagnetic duality quantum maxwell partition function turns generalised theta function based upon sum lattice . important role arguments played various versions call quantum stokes theorem. ordinary stokes theorem apply gauge potentials 2 topologically complicated manifolds potential dened contractible regions. deal manifold must covered contractible neighbourhoods. gauge potentials overlapping neighbourhoods must patched together gauge transformations. procedure introduces ambiguities candidate stokes theorem eliminated suitable exponentiation, yielding exponential version stokes theorem refer quantum stokes theorem. success procedure presupposes underlying complex wave function scalar. complex wave function spinor rather scalar, exponenti- ated line integral acquires extra overall sign ambiguity stemming double-valued nature spinor representation. sign eliminated squaring it. phenomenon means that, presence complex spinor wave functions, quantum stokes theorem formulated uxes surfaces whose boundary either vanishes even (that twice closed curve). surfaces respectively orientable non-orientable. remains unexpected sign well-dened un- ambiguous, taking values 1 according whether called stiefel-whitney class surface even odd (see equation (6.4)). result implications match precisely construction known mathe- maticians dierent point view, referred z2 cohomology. thus shed physical light mathematical nicety together stiefel-whitney class element second z2 cohomology group. following distinc- tion quantisation conditions (1.1) (1.2) subtle physical eects discuss. stiefel-whitney class shown concept extending self-intersection number (1.2), equivalently, characteristic vector ux lattice. encapsulated formula known wus formula. reader notice never used words magnetic monopole. none, far space-time m4 concerned. one imagine uxes originate magnetic monopoles situated somewhere outside space-time. means never question singularities elds points m4 corresponding positions. 2. four-manifolds homology going interested space-times consisting compact, connected oriented four-manifolds m4. manifolds obey poincare duality, symmetry topological properties seems related electromagnetic duality main interest. shall require m4 simply connected would exclude one interesting phenomena. sort topological structure m4 relevant study electromagnetic uxes known homology (and cohomology) described many textbooks refer, e.g. . thus hp(m, z) denotes abelian group formed adding (over integers z) classes closed pcycles mod pboundaries. dual boundary operator, , cobound- ary operator, , likewise squares zero. denes cohomology groups coclosed pcocycles mod pcoboundaries, h p(m, z). shall supposing suf- ciently well behaved groups nitely generated. may contain elements nite order. form well-dened nite subgroups, called torsion subgroups, 3 denoted tp(m, z) p(m, z), respectively. thus pcycle nite order n n smallest integer n boundary: n = .

(2.3) integers bp bp counting numbers copies known pth betti numbers m. one works real numbers (instead integers) torsion becomes invisible, leaving free parts. also relevant work integers mod 2, i.e. z2, corresponding groups hp(m, z2) h p(m, z2) contain new information since constructed explicitly hp(m, z) h p(m, z) known universal coecient theorem. theorem also implies following isomorphisms cohomology homology: f p(m, z) fp(m, z), p(m, z) tp1(m, z). (2.4) particular, betti numbers bp bp equal. far everything rather general special fact assumed possess features guaranteeing poincare duality means that: h p(m, z) hmp(m, z), (2.5) dimension m, (understood 4 m4 indicated). particular, yet betti numbers become equal: bp = bp = bmp = bmp. (2.6) cycles complementary dimensions (i.e. adding m) usually intersect nite number discrete points. owing fact oriented points assigned values 1 sum values points intersection yields integer known intersection number , denoted i(, ). integer depends homology classes cycles belong, that, upon cosets fp(m, z) belong. torsion cycles zero intersection number cycle. i(, ) = i(n , )/n = i(, )/n = i(0, )/n = 0, using linearity equation (2.1). 4 four-manifolds, 2cycles discrete points intersection other. let us consider basis 1, 2, . . . b2 integer lattice f2(m4, z) denote i(i, j) = (q1)ij.

(3.4) special case much general identity which, applied riemann surfaces yields riemanns bilinear identity. q dened (2.7) clear (3.4) symmetric. since uxes torsion cycles always vanish (by similar argument intersection numbers), entirely equivalent rewrite dirac quantisation condition (3.3) form qb zi f 2h = mi z. inserting (3.4) yields q2 b zm f 2h f 2h = b2 xi,j=1 miqijmj. (3.5) (3.6) thus integral also quantised, integral value quadratic quantised uxes depending topology intersection matrix q. physicists used integral non-abelian gauge theories instanton number exists even sphere s4.

(4.1) 8 torsion groups vanish. see undesirable degree simplication would occur assumed, addition, m4 simply connected. h1(m4, z) would vanish, hence, (4.1), torsion groups. four-manifolds considered always said w(2) lifts h 2(m4, z) 3 2 thing, according isomorphisms (4.1). four-manifolds always possess spinc structures hence complex spinor elds. accordingly, shall henceforth assume complex spinor elds exist m4 consider eect diracs quantisation condition. reconsider argument previous section take nite cover m4 neighbourhoods u. wave functions transform so(4) spinors introduce structure neighbourhood. well previous u (1) connection gauge potential must introduce oriented frame (vierbein) f complex spinor wave-function . choices, made neighbourhood u, independent. freedom choice related local u (1) gauge transformations local so(4) transformations qf e h , + d, f l f , s(l), l so(4). note lift l s(l) sign ambiguity quotient spin group spin(4) z2 isomorphic so(4). double overlap two contiguous neighbourhoods, u u 6= 0, must dene transition functions involving transformation groups = + d, f = lf , = s(l) e qf h .
