we develop the general theory of noether symmetries for constrained systems, that is, systems
that are described by singular lagrangians.
in our derivation, the dirac bracket structure with
respect to the primary constraints appears naturally and plays an important role in the characteri-
zation of the conserved quantities associated to these noether symmetries. the issue of projectability
of these symmetries from tangent space to phase space is fully analyzed, and we give a geometrical
interpretation of the projectability conditions in terms of a relation between the noether conserved
quantity in tangent space and the presymplectic form dened on it. we also examine the enlarged
formalism that results from taking the lagrange multipliers as new dynamical variables; we nd the
equation that characterizes the noether symmetries in this formalism, and we also prove that the
standard formulation is a particular case of the enlarged one. the algebra of generators for noether
symmetries is discussed in both the hamiltonian and lagrangian formalisms. we nd that a fre-
quent source for the appearance of open algebras is the fact that the transformations of momenta in
phase space and tangent space only coincide on shell. our results apply with no distinction to rigid
and gauge symmetries; for the latter case we give a general proof of existence of noether gauge sym-
metries for theories with rst and second class constraints that do not exhibit tertiary constraints in
the stabilization algorithm. among some examples that illustrate our results, we study the noether
gauge symmetries of the abelian chern-simons theory in 2n + 1 dimensions. an interesting feature
of this example is that its primary constraints can only be identied after the determination of the
secondary constraint. the example is worked out retaining all the original set of variables.

i. introduction

variational principles and symmetries are two of the
most fundamental organizing concepts in theoretical
physics. one can add to this list the gauge principle.
noether symmetries, that is, continuous transformations
that leave the action invariant up to boundary terms,
constitute a link between the rst two principles.
in
the case of a given gauge theory, some of the exist-
ing noether transformations exhibit special features (the
presence of noether identities, arbitrary functions, etc.)
that are associated with the redundancy in the descrip-
tion of degrees of freedom and the structure of constraints
that characterize these theories. in a gauge theory there
are two types of noether symmetries, rigid and gauge.
the rst ones are physical symmetries with standard
conserved quantities; the second, the gauge symmetries,
are unphysical, and their associated conserved quantities
vanish on-shell. we will deal simultaneously with both
types of symmetries.

noether transformations provide for a wide class of
symmetries of the equations of motion at the classical
level. they also become, in the absence of anomalies,
the symmetries of the quantum systems, and they are
neatly displayed in the path integral formulation. but
despite of the relevance of these symmetries for physical
systems, many aspects of their characterization as well as
the characterization of their conserved quantities, either
in the tangent space or in the phase space of some con-
guration space, have been insuciently studied. there
is at least one reason: it is neither immediate nor trivial
to extend the results that one can obtain for regular the-
ories (theories with no gauge invariances) to theories de-
scribed through singular lagrangians (thus having room
for gauge invariance). our aim is to contribute to such a
study.

we will rst focus in the rst place (more general cases
will be dealt with later) on innitesimal noether trans-
formations of the type q(q, q; t) in the tangent bundle
t q of some conguration space q, extended to include
the independent variable (time) to t q  r, for some the-
ory whose dynamics is described by a rst order varia-
tional principle based on a time-independent lagrangian
l(q, q). our transformations act only on the dependent
variables q; this is general enough because any innites-
imal transformation which also acts on the independent
variable t (or the space-time variables in eld theory)
can be brought to this form. the dening property of
these transformations is that they leave the lagrangian
invariant up to a total time derivative:

l =

d f
d t

.

(1.1)

(in the case of eld theory the total time derivative is
substituted by a total space-time divergence) we use the
language most common to physics.
in a more mathe-
matically oriented language, see [1], l would be under-
stood as the action on l of the prolongation of the vector

eld that generates the transformation. except for an in-
nitesimal parameter, q is the characteristic of such a
vector eld.

equation (1.1) guarantees that q maps solutions of the
equations of motion into solutions, because the equations
of motion remain invariant. associated with this noether
transformation there is always a conserved quantity,

gl = (l/ q)q  f.

that

is,

the lagrangian is non-singular,

if
if
det |l/ q q| 6= 0, then velocities are mapped one-to-
one to canonical momenta, and the conserved quantity
gl becomes in phase space the canonical generator, g,
acting through the poisson bracket, of the transforma-
tion q. however, the most common case in theoretical
physics is the case when l is singular. it is only under this
circumstance that the phenomena of gauge freedom may
occur. for a singular l, gl is still a projectable quan-
tity [2], that is, it may be brought to the phase space as a
function g. this function g is now uniquely dened only
up to the addition of linear combinations of the primary
constraints. in contrast with the non-gauge case, the fact
of being a canonical conserved quantity does not guar-
antee that g, or any of its equivalent functions whose
pull-back to tangent space is gl, generates q or even a
noether transformation. it is not even guaranteed that
q is a transformation projectable to phase space.

our study will clarify in what sense, and to what ex-
tent, we may consider g as the generator of the original
transformation q. we give a general characterization of
the functions g in phase space that are associated with a
lagrangian noether transformation in the case of gauge
theories, and we show the general construction, made out
of g, of these transformations. we prove that the pro-
jectability to phase space of q is related to a geometric
requirement that gl must satisfy. when this require-
ment is met, we show that q is canonically generated.

our procedure shows that there is a natural generaliza-
tion to a framework, the enlarged formalism, where the
dynamics is dened through the canonical lagrangian.
in this enlarged formalism the lagrange multipliers as-
sociated to the primary hamiltonian constraints become
new independent variables. then we can dene general-
ized noether transformations depending on the lagrange
multipliers and their time derivatives at any nite order.
we make contact here with the formulation in [3,4]. it
turns out that the results in [3] can be understood as
an application of our formulation in order to generate
noether gauge transformations for systems with only rst
class constraints in a systematic way.

our regularity assumptions are standard: we consider
that the hessian matrix of the lagrangian with respect
to the velocities has constant rank. we also assume that
the primary constraints may be split into rst and second
class on the primary constraint surface. some of our
results, particularly in section 4, will not depend on this
second assumption.

2

the paper is organized as follows:

in section 2 we
introduce some known results on the dynamics of la-
grangian and hamiltonian systems that will be needed
in the following sections.
in section 3 we develop the
general theory of noether symmetries for gauge systems.
in particular we characterize the conserved quantities in
phase space associated with these symmetries and we
give the method to retrieve the original noether trans-
formation out of its conserved quantity. it is remarkable
that the dirac bracket structure plays a natural role in
this context. we also relate the projectability conditions
for the noether transformation to a property of the la-
grangian noether conserved quantity gl that relates to
the presymplectic form in tangent space. we also see that
a projectable noether transformation always becomes a
canonical transformation in phase space.

in section 4 we introduce the enlarged formalism with
the canonical lagrangian. the denition of noether
transformations is then generalized by allowing q to de-
pend on the lagrange multipliers [3], and we prove the
equivalence with the former formulation when this depen-
dence does not contain derivatives of the lagrange mul-
tipliers. in section 5 some properties of the algebras of
transformations and generators are exhibited. in particu-
lar we show that the closure under poisson bracket of the
algebra of generators in phase space does not necessarily
guarantee the closure of the algebra of the innitesimal
transformations in conguration space. this fact is rele-
vant for the application of brst methods [5]. in section
6 we distinguish between rigid and gauge noether sym-
metries, and extend some theorems concerning the exis-
tence of canonical gauge noether transformations to sys-
tems with rst and second class constraints with only one
step in the stabilization algorithm. finally, we present
some examples to illustrate our results and a short ap-
pendix devoted to the concept of auxiliary variables that
will be used in section 4. of particular interest is exam-
ple 4, devoted to the analysis of the noether gauge sym-
metries of the abelian chern-simons theory in 2n + 1
dimensions. the example is worked out retaining all the
original set of variables. it is interesting to remark that
this example violates one of our regularity assumptions,
but we show that it can be still accommodated within
our formalism.

our results are local. they apply to systems with a
nite number of degrees of freedom as well as to eld
theories. we use, for simplicity, the language of mechan-
ics. dewitts condensed index notation [6] translate our
results directly to eld theory as long as the boundary
conditions allow for the elimination of surface terms.

we rely on previous work, particularly [79] and refer-
ences therein, and so we must rst summarize some of the
results of these papers before proceeding to subsequent
developments.

ii. elements of lagrangian and

hamiltonian dynamics for gauge

theories

the euler-lagrange functional derivative of a rst or-

der lagrangian l(q, q), is

[l]i := i  wis qs,

where

wij :=

2l
 qi qj

and i := 

2l
 qiqs qs +

l
qi .

we consider the general case where the hessian w =
(wij ) may be a singular matrix [10]. we assume that its
rank is constant in the region of tangent space of our in-
terest. if w is singular, there exists a kernel for the pull-
back fl of the legendre map fl from conguration-
velocity space t q (the tangent bundle t q of the con-
guration space q) to phase space t q (the cotangent
bundle). this kernel is spanned by the vector elds

 = i



 qi ,

(2.1)

 span a basis for the null vectors of wij . 1 a
where i
function g(q, q) is projectable to phase space if and only
if

g = 0.

notice that the lagrangian equations of motion [l]i = 0
imply the primary lagrangian constraints

 := (ii

) = 0.

the time evolution for a gauge theory is not unique un-
til the gauge freedom has been removed, for example, by
way of some gauge xing. this is reected in the ambigu-
ities present in the lagrangian time-evolution dierential
operator [7]:

xl :=


t

+ qs 

qs + as(q, q)


 qs +  =: x0 + ,
(2.2)

where as are functions which are determined by the for-
malism, and  are arbitrary functions. these arbitrary
functions express the gauge freedom of the time-evolution

1notice that if the phase space is enlarged by introducing
the lagrange multipliers as new dynamical variables, the ac-
cordingly enlarged legendre map will now become invert-
ible. therefore we expect that the problems related with
projectability can be overcome in this enlarged formalism.
we will consider this issue in section 4.

operator. notice that projectable quantities have a well
dened unambiguous dynamics. the tangency of xl to
the primary lagrangian constraint surface, dened by
 = 0, may lead to new constraints and to the determi-
nation of some of the functions . at this point, new
tangency requirements may occur [10,11].

it is not necessary to use the hamiltonian technique to

nd the , but it does facilitate the calculation:

i

pi (cid:19) ,
 = fl(cid:18) 

(2.3)

where the  are the hamiltonian primary constraints.
they satisfy by denition fl = 0.

these constraints  span a basis for the ideal of func-
tions in t q that vanish on the image of the legendre
map fl. we take as an assumption that these con-
straints may be split into rst class, 0 , and second
class, 1 , 2 satisfying

{0 , } = pc,

det |{1 , 1 }| 6= 0,

(2.4)

where {, } is the poisson bracket structure and pc
stands for a generic linear combination of the primary
constraints.

the lagrangian energy, el(q, q) := qi(l/ qi)  l,
is a function projectable to phase space. the canonical
hamiltonian hc(q, p), which is only uniquely dened up
to primary constraints, is dened such that its pullback
to tangent space is the lagrangian energy:

the hamiltonian time evolution vector eld is given

by

xh :=


t

+ {, hc} + {, },

(2.9)

where  are arbitrary functions of time. however, they
are determined as non-projectable functions in tangent
space: they are the functions v(q, q) implicitly dened
by equations (2.5). these variables  are lagrange mul-
tipliers.

the requirement of tangency of xh to the primary
hamiltonian constraint surface, dened by , may lead
to new constraints and to the determination of some of
the functions . this is the setting of the stabilization
algorithm in phase space, that runs parallel (see [7]) to
the corresponding algorithm in tangent space. details on
the relationship between the functions  in t q and the
functions  in t q are given in [12].

with the identities (2.5) and (2.6), we can relate the
time evolution in the hamiltonian and the lagrangian
formalisms for any function f (q, p; t). in [7] an evolution
operator k is dened that gives the time evolution of a
function f in t q  r as a function in t q  r,

kf := fl f
t

+ qfl f
q

+

l
q

fl f
p

.

(2.10)

this operator k is fully studied in [9]. notice the imme-
diate result

flhc = el.

k = ,

(2.11)

to connect the lagrangian and hamiltonian dynamics
it is convenient to write down the two following identities
[7]:

which is deduced by recalling that fl = 0. using the
identities (2.5) and (2.6), we can get a new expression for
kf ,

qi = fl(

hc
pi

) + v(q, q)fl(


pi

),

and

l
qi = fl(

hc
qi )  v(q, q)fl(


qi );

(2.5)

(2.6)

kf = fl f
t

+ fl{f, hc} + vfl{f, }.

(2.12)

with this new expression, application of the vector elds
 to (2.11) gives the following result [7]:

 = fl{ , }.

(2.13)

where the functions v are determined so as to render the
rst relation an identity. notice the important relation

v = 
,

(2.7)

which stems from applying  to the rst identity and
taking into account that

  fl = 0,

(2.8)

where  denotes the composition operation.

2exceptions to this assumption can be still accomodated
within our formalism, as example 4 of section 7 shows.

4

now we are ready to relate the primary lagrangian
constraints to the secondary hamiltonian constraints and
the canonical determination of some arbitrary functions
of the hamiltonian dynamics. to this end, let us rst
apply (2.10) to f = 0 ,

0 = k0 = fl{0 , hc} + vfl{0 , }

= fl{0 , hc},

where we have used (2.4). then, if we dene the sec-
ondary hamiltonian constraints as

1
0 := {0, h},

(2.14)

their pullback to tangent space gives a subset of the pri-
mary lagrangian constraints 3,

and we will investigate the conversion of this symmetry
to the hamiltonian formalism. dening

0 = fl1

0 .

(2.15)

next, applying (2.10) to f = 1 , we nd

1 = k1 = fl{1 , h} + v fl{1 ,  }

= fl{1 , h} + v1 fl{1 , 1 }. (2.16)

we can write

gl = (

l
 qi )qi  f,

[l]iqi +

dgl
dt

= 0.

(3.1)

(3.2)

the stabilization of the second class constraints xes
some arbitrariness in the hamiltonian dynamics xh.
the arbitrary functions 1 become determined as canon-
ical functions 1
c

through

0 = {1, hc} + 1

c {1 , 1 }.

(2.17)

then, we can put together (2.16) and (2.17) to get:

1 = (v1  fl1

c )fl{1 , 1 }.

(2.18)

notice that the rst class and second class classication
of the primary constraints has an eect in the tangent
space formalism:
it classies the primary lagrangian
constraints into two sets according to their projectability
to phase space. some of the lagrangian constraints, 0 ,
are projectable, as shown by (2.15), whereas the rest, the
constraints 1 , are non-projectable, as we can verify by
applying (2.7) and (2.8) to (2.18). notice also that the
constraints of the type 0 , or some of them, may vanish
identically, whereas the constraints of the type 1 are
all independent.

this nishes the summary of results that will be used

in the next sections.

iii. noether symmetries

a. general theory of noether symmetries in tangent

space and in phase space

we start with an innitesimal noether lagrangian
symmetry on t q  r, that is, an innitesimal q(q, q; t)
such that

l =

d f
d t

,

with

d
d t

=


 t

+ q


 q

+ q


 q

+ ... ,

notice that the highest derivative in (3.2), q, appears
linearly. then, since (3.2) is identically satised for a
noether symmetry q, the coecient of qi must vanish:4

wisqs 

gl
 qi = 0.

(3.3)

we contract (3.3) with a null vector i

 to nd that

gl = 0.

(3.4)

it follows that gl is projectable to a function g in t q;
that is, it is the pullback of a function (not necessarily
unique) in t q:

gl = fl(g).

this important property, valid for any conserved quan-
tity associated with an innitesimal noether symmetry
of the type considered here, was rst pointed out in [2].
observe that g is determined up to the addition of linear
combinations of the primary constraints. substitution of
this result in (3.3) gives

wis(cid:18)qs  fl(cid:18) g

ps(cid:19)(cid:19) = 0,

and so the parentheses enclose a null vector of w:

qi = fl(cid:18) g

pi(cid:19) x

ri
,

(3.5)

for some r(q, q; t).

our aim is to get a complete characterization of the
canonical generator g in phase space. we start by den-
ing

pi =

l
 qi .

(3.6)

4 notice that if wis is invertible we can deduce from (3.3)
the form of the associated noether transformation,

3notice that our notation for the secondary hamiltonian
constraints may give some redundancy, for there is no guar-
antee that every 1
0 denes a new independent constraint.
this potential redundancy creates no problem within our
formulation.

qs = w is gl
 qi

where w is denotes the inverse to wis.

5

after subtraction from (3.2) of the piece containing qi,
we obtain

however, 1
c

is determined from (2.17) as

c = m 11 {1 , hc}.
1

introduction of this result into (3.13) produces the nat-
ural appearance of the dirac bracket [10]:

qs(cid:19) fl(
(cid:18) l
qi  qs  pi
) x
+ qi 
qi fl(g) + fl(

g
pi

ri

!

g
t

) = 0,

(3.7)

fl(

g
t

) + fl{g, hc} + v0 fl{g, 0 } = r,

which simplies to

(3.14)

l
qi fl(

g
pi

) + qifl(

g
qi ) + fl(

g
t

) = r. (3.8)

where the dirac bracket is dened, at this stage of the
stabilization algorithm, by

substitution of the two identities (2.15) and (2.18) into
(3.8) yields (see [14])

{a, b} := {a, b}  {a, 1 }m 11{1 , b}.

now apply 0 to (3.14). using (2.7) and (2.8) we

fl(

g
t

) + fl{g, hc} + vfl{g, } = r. (3.9)

arrive at

fl{g, 0 } = (0 r )

(3.15)

notice that (3.9) is invariant under

r  r + s, where s = a  + s
0 ,

(3.10)

with a an arbitrary antisymmetric matrix with functions
in t q  r as components, and with s
0 any function in
t q  r not vanishing at the lagrangian primary con-
straint surface and such that s
0  is identically zero.
such s
0 only exist [13] for theories whose projectable
primary lagrangian constraints are not all independent.
these indeterminacies for r in (3.9) entail an irrele-

vant (trivial) change in the qi of (3.5):

qi  1qi = qi  aij[l]j  s

0 i
,

(3.11)

where aij = i
(3.2) because [l]i1qi = [l]iqi.

a j

. this result is already obvious in

now we will obtain a purely hamiltonian characteriza-
tion of g. in doing so the relevance of the dirac bracket
structure will be emphasized. let us introduce v1 of
(2.18) into (3.9). we get

fl(

g
) + fl{g, hc} + v0 fl{g, 0 }
t
c + m 11 1) fl{g, 1 } = r,
+ (fl1

(3.12)

where m = (m 11 ) is dened as the matrix inverse of
the poisson bracket matrix of the primary second class
constraints. dene

r1 := r1  fl{g, 1 }m 11

and

we get

fl(

g
t

r0 := r0 .

) + fl{g, hc} + v0 fl{g, 0 }
c fl{g, 1 } = r.

+fl1

(3.13)

6

where we have also used (2.13) and (2.4) to get 0  =
0. but since the left side of (3.15) is a projectable func-
tion, so must be the right. however, only the constraints
0 are projectable. indeed, according to (2.15), they are
the pullback of the secondary hamiltonian constraints.
in conclusion, we can write that

{g, 0 } = sc + pc,

(3.16)

where sc (pc) stands for a linear combination of secondary
(primary) hamiltonian constraints. introduce this result
in (3.14); the same reasoning yields

g
t

+ {g, hc} = sc + pc.

(3.17)

notice that (3.16) can be equivalently written as

{g, 0 } = sc + pc.

(3.18)

let us remark that the secondary constraints in the
right sides of (3.16) and (3.17) are the stabilization of
the primary rst class constraints, as dened in (2.14).
therefore we are not only saying that the left sides of
(3.16) and (3.17) must vanish on the surface dened by
the primary plus secondary constraints. we are say-
ing something more restrictive, because some of the sec-
ondary constraints, as obtained through the stabilization
of the primary rst class constraints according to (2.14),
may be ineective (that is, such that their gradient also
vanishes in the constraint surface). in such a case, the
left sides of (3.16) and (3.17) must reect this fact. par-
ticular examples of this behavior can be found in [16].

we have arrived at the following result: the necessary
and sucient condition for a function g  t q  r to
be a noether canonical conserved quantity, that is, such
that its pullback to t q  r satises equation (3.2) for
some q, is that g satises equations (3.16) and (3.17).
this result generalizes to systems with gauge freedom
the standard denition of a noether conserved quantity
in phase space.

b. getting q from g

equations (3.16) and (3.17) express the most gen-
eral condition for a canonical conserved quantity to be
noether, that is, such that gl = flg satises (3.2) for
some qi(q, q; t). in fact, if g satises (3.16) and (3.17),
then qi can be obtained, except, of course, for the ar-
bitrariness described in (3.11), from g as follows. let
us rst rewrite (3.16) and (3.17) using a notation for the
coecients in the secondary constraints:

see now, the quantities a0 are readily absorbed through
a redenition of g. instead, the quantities b0
0 are the
true obstructions to projectability: they cannot be ab-
sorbed in g by the changes allowed because g is only
determined up to primary constraints. we dene

g = g  a0 0

(3.24)

and then

g = g  {g, 1 }m 11 1 .

(3.25)

g
t

+ {g, hc} = a0 1

0 + pc,

{g, 0 } = b0

01

0 + pc.

(3.19)

(3.20)

(g is the starred function dened [10] for g; it allows
to put the star within the bracket and to continue with
the poisson bracket instead of the dirac bracket: for any
f , {, f } = {, f } + pc) conditions (3.19) and (3.20)
are then modied to

notice that only the coecients b0
0 are invariant under
the changes of g allowed by the addition of arbitrary lin-
ear combinations of the primary constraints 5. compar-
ing (3.19) and (3.20) with (3.14) and (3.15), we identify
a set of solutions for r,

r0 = fla0 + v0 flb0
0 ,

g
t

+ {g, hc} = pc,

{g, 0 } = b0

0 1

0 + pc,

{g, 1 } = pc.

r1 = 0,

the noether transformation qi then becomes

(3.26)

(3.27)

(3.28)

(3.29)

that give

and

r0 = fla0 + v0 flb0
0

(3.21)

r1 = fl{g, 1 }m 11 .

(3.22)

the general solution for the r may be obtained using
(3.10).

using (3.21) and (3.22) in (3.5) we nd the result we

were looking for,

qi = fl{qi, g}  (fla0 + v0 flb0

0 )i

0 . (3.23)

notice again the natural appearance of the dirac bracket.
up to now, g is any function in t q  r whose pull-
back to t q  r is gl. we have obtained therefore the
following results: first, we have in (3.16) and (3.17) the
conditions for a function g in phase space to be associ-
ated with a lagrangian noether transformation. next,
this transformation is entirely recovered through (3.23),
up to the addition of trivial pieces of the type described
in (3.11).

notice that in general there are obstructions that pre-
vent qi from being canonically generated. as we will

5in the case of gauge symmetries, a redenition of the arbi-
trary functions may help to achieve projectability, see section
6.2.

7

qi = fl{qi, g}  v0 (flb0

0 )i

0 .

we also learn from this last expression that the con-
ditions for the projectability of the transformation qi
are equivalent to the conditions for qi to be canonically
generated. that is: a noether transformation in phase
space is always a canonical transformation.

notice that all primary constraints satisfy (3.19) and
(3.20) as does g. in the case of the primary second class
constraints 1 , a0 and b0
0 vanish, and qi in (3.23) is
just zero; and so this case is uninteresting. in the case
of the primary rst class constraints 0 , an interesting
case is when {0 , hc} = pc, that is, when a0 is zero.
then (t)0 is a gauge generator for arbitrary . other
cases associated with 0 must include [1821] a chain
of rst class secondary, tertiary, etc., constraints as well.

c. geometrical interpretation of the projectability

conditions

it is possible to give a geometrical meaning to the
projectability conditions for the noether transformations
from tangent space to phase space. observe in (3.23), or
(3.29), that it is the presence of the matrix b = (b0
0 )
that prevents this transformation qi from being pro-
jectable to phase space. technically, the condition of
projectability for at least one of the transformations qi
among the set given by (3.11) is that

fl(b0

0 1

0 ) = 0, 0,

(3.30)

because this makes the sc term in the right side of (3.20),
or (3.27), a pc term.
in such case (3.26), (3.27), and
(3.28) become

g
t

+ {g, hc} = pc,

{g, } = pc.

(3.31)

(3.32)

equations (3.31) and (3.32) are the conditions obtained
in [8] to dene a projectable noether transformation
qi = fl{qi, g}.

there is an elegant way to rephrase the conditions that
make the lagrangian noether transformation projectable
to phase space. consider the kernel of the presymplectic
form l in tangent space. this presymplectic form is
dened as the pullback of the standard symplectic form
in phase space, that is,

 qi(cid:19) .
l := dqi  d(cid:18) l

a basis for its kernel is provided [17] by the vector elds

 = j



 qj

(3.33)

and

0 = j
0


qj + j

0


 qj ,

with j

0 given by

j
0 = k

0
pj

 fl  1

pj ! .

0

(3.35)

it is also shown in [17] that, for any function f (q, p; t) on
t q  r, the following property holds:

0(flf ) = fl{f, 0 } .

(3.36)

let us now apply the basis vectors of this kernel to our

noether conserved quantity gl. we have (3.4),

gl = 0,

and also

0gl = 0 (flg) = fl{g, 0 } = fl(b0

0 1

0 ),
(3.37)

where (3.36) and (3.20) have been used. recall that the
conditions of projectability for qi are equations (3.30).
we can write therefore the projectability conditions for
qi as

gl = 0, 0 gl = 0.

(3.38)

8

(3.34)

as we have already seen, the relation (3.2)

therefore: the necessary and sucient condition for
a lagrangian noether conserved function gl to be as-
sociated through (3.2) with a transformation qi that is
projectable to phase space is that gl must give zero when
acted upon by the vector elds in the kernel of the presym-
plectic form in tangent space.

notice, as a consequence, that if all primary con-
straints are second class (at the primary level), then the
basis of this kernel is simply , and therefore all noether
transformations may be chosen to be projectable.

d. conditions for the noether conserved quantity,

revisited

equations (3.16) and (3.17) display the necessary and
sucient conditions for a constant of motion g in phase
space to be associated with a noether transformation
(either projectable or not) in tangent space. what is the
rationale for these conditions? of course they say that g
is indeed a constant of motion. but there are constants
of motion that only satisfy less restrictive conditions that
g does, because in (3.16) and (3.17) use has not been
made of the full stabilization algorithm to exhibit all
the constraints of the theory, but only the rst step.
why is it that, for a constant of motion to be noether,
the specic conditions (3.16) and (3.17) must be met?
now we will give an independent argument to explain
these results.

[l]iqi +

d gl
d t

= 0

is telling us that gl is a constant of motion for the dy-
namics dened by [l]i = 0.
in (3.2), q, q, q play the
role of independent variables. this means that only the
primary lagrangian constraints  = 0 are taken into
account, for they are the only constraints algebraically
included in [l]i = 0. the correspondence of these
constraints with the hamiltonian constraints has been
discussed in section 2. the primary hamiltonian con-
straints,  = 0, are non-dynamical in the sense that
they do not appear as a consequence of the equations of
motion but only dene the image in t q of the legen-
dre map. recalling section 2 they classify into rst class
and second class. the rst step of the hamiltonian sta-
bilization algorithm will determine some arbitrary func-
tions 1 (the lagrange multipliers of the primary second
class constraints) as canonical functions 1
c , and some
secondary constraints 1
0 := {0 , hc}. as we have seen
in (2.15), the pullback of the secondary constraints gives
a subset of the primary lagrangian constraints. the rest
of the primary lagrangian constraints, as displayed in
(2.18), come from comparing the canonical determina-
of the functions 1 from their determination
tion 1
c
v1 in tangent space.

it is therefore clear what the status of the noether
canonical quantity g must be: it must be a constant

of motion for the dynamical operator that is obtained
after the rst step of the stabilization algorithm has been
performed. we can translate this result into equations.
the hamiltonian dynamics after this rst step is given
by an evolution operator that, using the dirac bracket,
has the form:

x1

h :=


t

+ {, hc} + 0 {, 0 }

(3.39)

with 0 arbitrary functions. it is irrelevant to write a
poisson bracket or a dirac bracket for the term with 0 .
the dynamics given by x1
h is tangent to the hamilto-
nian primary constraint surface but not necessarily to the
secondary constraint surface dened by 1
0 = 0. this is
parallel to the fact that the lagrangian dynamics is not
necessarily tangent to the primary lagrangian constraint
surface, dened by  = 0. since at this stage of the
stabilization algorithm we have only information on the
primary and secondary constraints, under the action of
the dynamics the constant of motion g must satisfy

we can compute  p, for p dened in (3.6). the result is
[14]

 pi = fl{pi, g}  v0 fl(b0

0 {pi, 0 }) + [l]j

qj
 qi .
(3.41)

the last piece vanishes on shell, that is, when the equa-
tions of motion are satised, so we have an interesting
parallelism between (3.40) and (3.41). this new piece
[l]jqj/ qi, will play an important role when we con-
sider in section 5 the commutation algebra of transforma-
tions in conguration space as compared to the poisson
algebra of generators in phase space.

equations (3.40) and (3.41) suggest an enlargement of
the formalism: replace the functions v0 (q, q) by a set of
independent variables 0 , the lagrange multipliers, with
vanishing poisson bracket with the canonical variables,
and dene

x1

h(g) =

g
t

+ {g, hc} + 0 {g, 0 } = sc + pc,

then,

but since the functions 0 are, also at this stage, com-
pletely arbitrary, this relation splits into

gc := g  0 b0

0 0 .

qi = (fl{qi, gc})|=v,
 pi = (fl{pi, gc})|=v + [l]jqj/ qi.

and

g
t

+ {g, hc} = sc + pc,

{g, 0 } = sc + pc,

which are exactly the conditions (3.16) and (3.17), found
in the previous section. we have argued, therefore, that
these conditions are the correct characterization of the
canonical constants of motion g associated with la-
grangian noether transformations.

notice also that in the same way that (3.16) and (3.17)
are related to x1
h, that is, the dynamics after the rst
step in the stabilization algorithm, the conditions (3.31)
and (3.32) that ensure the projectability of a noether
transformation are related to the evolution operator xh
dened in equation (2.9), that describes the dynamics
before the rst step in the stabilization algorithm.

e. the transformation of momenta

up to now, we have been using hamiltonian techniques
to characterize the noether conserved quantity in phase
space, but we have only considered the transformation of
the conguration variables, q, as in (3.29),

qi = fl{qi, g}  v0 fl(b0

0 {qi, 0 }).

(3.40)

now we will explore the transformation for the momen-
tum variables. using the tools introduced in section 2,

since in  pi the second time derivatives of the congu-
ration variables qi are absorbed within a piece that van-
ishes on shell, it is natural to introduce in this enlarged
space of variables q, p and  the noether transformations
of the canonical variables as

qi = {qi, gc},

pi = {pi, gc},

thus putting the transformations of qs and ps on the
same footing. this is the starting point for the next
section.

iv. the enlarged formalism

it is useful in many respects to reformulate the action

principle with the canonical lagrangian,

lc(q, p, ; q, p, ) := pi qi  hc(q, p)  (q, p).

the new conguration space for lc is the old phase space
enlarged with the lagrange multipliers  as new inde-
pendent variables. we use enlarged instead of ex-
tended to avoid any confusion with the extended
dirac hamitonian dynamics, where all nal rst class
constraints, primary, secondary, etc., are added to the
hamiltonian with independent lagrange multipliers (in
the usual diracs theory, which is always equivalent to
the lagrangian formulation, only the nal primary rst
class constraints are added to the hamiltonian.) the
dynamics given by lc is nothing but the constrained

9

dirac hamiltonian dynamics for a system with canoni-
cal hamiltonian hc and a number of primary constraints
.

this formulation has the advantage that all constraints
are holonomic, that is, dened in conguration space
and that the poisson bracket structure dened in the
old phase space is still available. inspired by the results
of the last section, we will look for noether transforma-
tions for lc that may depend on the lagrange multi-
pliers and their time derivatives to any nite order and
that are canonically generated for the variables qi and
pi (, , , ... will have a vanishing poisson bracket with
these variables). let us establish the conditions for a
function gc(q, p, , , , ...; t) to be a noether generator,
under the denitions

cqi = {qi, gc},

cpi = {pi, gc},

(4.1)

makes clc = d
dt (p q  g), that is, a noether transfor-
mation for the enlarged formalism. equation (4.3) is im-
portant: it is the equation characterizing the generators
of noether transformations in the enlarged formalism.
it applies both to rigid and gauge noether symmetries,
and encodes in a compact way the theoretical setting
of the results given in [3] (see also [4]) to nd an algo-
rithm to produce gauge generators for theories with only
rst class constraints. we have arrived at the follow-
ing result: the necessary and sucient condition for a
function gc(q, p, , , , ...; t) to generate through (4.1) a
noether symmetry in the enlarged formalism is that gc
must fulll equation (4.3).

note that this result has been obtained with no as-
sumptions concerning the rst and second class structure
of the primary constraints. note also that in (4.3) only
the primary constraints are relevant.

and with c to be determined below.

compute clc,

clc = cpi qi +

(pi cqi)  picqi  chc

=

(pi cqi) + {pi, gc} qi  {qi, gc} pi

 {hc, gc}  {, gc}  (c)

a. back to the original lagrangian

we may wonder whether these noether symmetries for
lc are also noether symmetries for l. the answer is yes,
and the proof goes as follows.

first, we must show how to obtain the original la-
grangian l from the canonical lagrangian lc. consider
the equations of motion [lc] = 0 for p and ,

=

d
dt

(pi cqi)  qi gc

qi  pi
 {, gc}  (c)

gc
pi

 {hc, gc}

qi 

hc
pi

+  
pi

= 0,

+ ...

 = 0.

these equations may be used to obtain p and  in terms
of the variables q and q. we nd

pi = pi(q, q),

 = v(q, q),

where the functions v are those dened in (2.5) and the
functions pi are yet to be interpreted. then the original
lagrangian l is retrieved as

l(q, q) = lc|(pi= pi,=v),

and it satises that l/ qi = pi. this is the interpreta-
tion for the functions pi.

what we have just described is the standard method
to re-obtain l by using the information provided by hc
and the primary constraints . this method, when
rephrased, as we do here, in terms of the canonical la-
grangian, is just a reduction procedure from lc to l that
can be independently justied [16]. we prove in the ap-
pendix that it is legitimate to substitute within the la-
grangian (lc in our case) the auxiliary variables, that is,
the variables (p and  in our case) that can be isolated
by using their own equations of motion.

now, given a generalized noether transformation cqi
associated, according to (4.1), with a constant of motion

hd = hc + .

(4.2)

we have also introduced the notation [3]

and the total time derivative

dgc

:=

dgc

if we require

dgc

+ {gc, hd} = pc,

(4.3)

and if we represent this combination pc of primary con-
straints as pc = c , then the denition

c = c ,

(4.4)

10

gc, we can readily prove that qi := (cqi)|(p= p,=v)
( = v includes, obviously,  = v = (v/q) + q(v/ q),
and so on for , etc.) denes a noether transformation
for l. indeed we have, by denition,

[lc]qcq + [lc]pcp + [lc]c +

dgc
dt

= 0;

([lc]q,
[lc]p, and [lc] stand for the euler-lagrange
derivatives of lc with respect to the coordinates qi, pi
and , respectively) then, realizing that [lc]p|(p= p,=v)
and [lc]|(p= p,=v) are identically zero, we nd

([lc]qcq)|(p= p,=v) +

dgl
dt

= 0,

where gl := gc|(p= p,=v). but, since  and p are auxil-
iary variables for the enlarged formalism, we have

and therefore,

[lc]q|(p= p,=v) = [l]q

[l]iqi +

dgl
dt

= 0,

which proves our assertion.

b. equivalence between the enlarged and the

standard formalisms

first, we will prove that all our results of section 3 can
be translated to the enlarged formalism. to this end,
take g satisfying (3.26), (3.27), and (3.28). then the
denition

gc := g  0 b0

0 0

(4.5)

makes gc satisfy (4.3). (the proof is straightforward)

next we will prove the reverse in the only case for
which such a proof makes sense, namely, the case of a
noether generator gc in the enlarged formalism that
only depends on  but not on its time derivatives (in
section 3 we considered q and gl dened in t q  r).
let gc(q, p, ; t) be such a noether generator, fullling
the requirements (4.3). the coecient of  in (4.3) will
therefore satisfy

gc


= pc,

which implies the following form for gc:

gc(q, p, ; t) = g0(q, p) + g

1 (q, p, ; t)(q, p).

the lagrangian conserved quantity gl is then

gl := gc|(p= p,=v) = g0|(p= p) = flg0,

and the innitesimal noether transformation for l is

qi := (cqi)|(p= p,=v)

=

g0
pi

|(p= p) + g

1 (q, p, ; t)|(p= p,=v)i
,

which satises, according to the results of the previous
subsection, [l]iqi + dgl/dt = 0.

since gl is the pullback of g0, we conclude, owing to
the results of the previous subsection and those of section
3 (under the assumption of the existence of the splitting
of the primary constraints into rst and second class),
that g0 satises (3.19) and (3.20) with some a0 and
b0
0 . now, following the same route as we did in section
3.2 from equation (3.23) to (3.29), we can dene g
0 , out
of g0, such that

1qi := fl{qi, g

0 }  v0 (flb0

0 )i
0

satises [l]i1qi +dgl/dt = 0. subtracting this equation
from the equation satised by qi above gives

[l]i(qi  1qi) = 0.

(4.6)

the coecient of qi in (4.6) tells us that qi  1qi =
s for some functions s. the rest of the equation
dictates that s = 0. thus the dierence between qi
and 1qi is entirely due to the indeterminacies already
displayed in (3.11).

this proves that, except for these irrelevant indetermi-
nacies, that are inherent to the formalism, the noether
transformations in the tangent bundle that are obtained
through the methods of section 3 are the same than
those obtained within the enlarged formalism when we
restrict ourselves to dependences on the lagrange multi-
pliers that do not include their time derivatives. more-
over, the enlarged formalism provides us with conditions
to be satised by a general function gc(q, p, , , , ...; t)
in order to generate a noether transformation in the n-th
tangent bundle.

v. the algebra of transformations

and generators

first consider the simplest case, when the noether
transformations are dened in tangent space and are pro-
jectable to phase space. this means that formulas (3.31)
and (3.32) apply in this case. consider two functions g1
and g2, dened in t q  r, which satisfy,

gr
t

+ {gr, hc} = pc,

(5.1)

and

{gr, } = pc,

(5.2)

for r = 1, 2. then it is straightforward to prove that
g(2,1)
:= {g2, g1} also satises the same equations
(5.1) and (5.2). g(2,1) is a noether conserved quan-
tity and a generator of noether transformations. does

11

g(2,1) generate the commutator transformation [1, 2]q?
the answer in general is no. let us distinguish between
lagrangian transformations l and hamiltonian trans-
formations h .
r f := {f, gr} for any
f  t q  r, then

if we dene h

r qi = fl(h
l

r qi),

and according to (3.41),

next, we consider the case of noether transformations
q of the type (3.29), that is, transformations dened in
t q  r that are not projectable to t q  r. it is conve-
nient to work in the framework of the enlarged formalism
of section 4, that is, we consider qi := (cqi)|(p= p,=v),
with cqi = {qi, gc}, where gc, as dened in (4.5), sat-
ises (4.3). if we have two such transformations, their
corresponding noether conserved quantities, gc
1 and gc
2,
will satisfy equation (4.3)

r pi = fl(h
l

r pi) + [l]j

l
r qj
 qi

.

d gc
r
dt

+ {gc

r, hd} = c 

r ,

now we can compare the poisson bracket of canonical
generators with the commutator of lagrangian transfor-
mations. the jacobi identity implies, for the commutator
of the hamiltonian transformations,

[h

1 , h

2 ]qi = {qi, {g2, g1}}.

instead, the commutator of the lagrangian transforma-
tions of the conguration variables becomes

1 , l

[l
2g1
pkpl

2 ]qi = fl({qi, {g2, g1}})

2g2
pipj



2g2

).

(5.3)

[l]kwjl(

the second term in the right side of equation (5.3) is
an antisymmetric combination of the equations of mo-
tion.
(5.3) displays an open algebra structure for the
commutator of the transformations of the conguration
variables, that is, an algebra that only closes on shell.
more specically, even if we have, at the canonical level,
a closed poisson algebra structure, for instance a lie al-
gebra of generators, when we turn to conguration space,
the commutation algebra of the transformations will de-
velop a term which is an antisymmetric combination of
the equations of motion. unless one of the generators
involved, g1, g2, is at most linear in the momenta, in
which case its second partial derivatives in (5.3) vanish,
these open algebra terms are almost unavoidable. the
general rule is that a sucient condition for the com-
mutation relations of the projectable noether transforma-
tions in conguration space to coincide with the poisson
bracket relations of their generators in phase space is that
at least all but one of the generators are linear in the
momenta. this result was already noted in [22]. an in-
teresting example of a set of generators satisfying this
sucient condition is furnished by the canonical formu-
lation of general relativity, that is, the adm formalism
[23].

the gauge algebra plays a fundamental role concerning
the quantization of gauge theories, as shown by the brst
methods.
in particular, the eld-antield method [5],
that works in the space of eld congurations, is bound
to exhibit, in a certain number of cases, open algebra
structures that originate in the type of phenomena here
discussed.

2, gc

for certain functions c 
r (r = 1, 2.). it is easy to check
that {gc
1} does not satises (4.3) in general. the
reason is that the variation of the lagrange multipliers
has not been taken into account. when (4.4) is included,
we nd

gc

(2,1) := {gc

2, gc

1}  (c 0

1 b0

20  c 0

2 b0

10 )0 .

it is immediate to check that gc
tice that gc
comes from the quantities c 0
dependence may be displayed by noting that c 0
0 b0

(2,1) satises (4.3). no-
(2,1) contains a new dependence in 0 that
r . the structure of this
r =

r0 + ..., therefore

gc

(2,1) := {gc

2, gc

10 b0

20  b0

20b0

1} (cid:16) 0 (b0

10 ) + ...(cid:17) 0 .

(5.4)

thus, unless the matrices b1 and b2 commute, the
new generator in the enlarged formalism gc
(2,1) will not
be associated with a transformation of the type (3.29)
(because of this new dependence on 0 ). now gc
(2,1) is a
generalized generator of noether transformations dened
within the framework of the enlarged formalism of section
4, that is, satisfying (4.3).

using the two lagrangian noether conserved quanti-

ties,

gl

1 := flgc

1, gl

2 := flgc
2,

(5.5)

we can get the third lagrangian noether conserved quan-
tity

gl

(2,1) := (gc

(2,1))|(p= p, =v)

= fl({gc
2, gc
1})|(=v)
= fl{g
2 , g
1 }
 v0 fl(b0

10 b0

20  b0

20 b0

10 )0 ,

(5.6)

but notice that gl
(2,1) is not in general projectable to
phase space because of its dependence on the functions
v0 (the associated transformation is generated by (5.4)
and in general will exhibit dependences in the accelera-
tions, contained in 0 ). indeed it is projectable if the
matrices b1 and b2 commute.

12

vi. noether transformations, rigid

and gauge

up to now our discussion has been completely gen-
eral and it applies to both rigid and gauge innitesimal
noether transformations. rigid, that is, global noether
transformations are physical symmetries of the system.
instead, gauge, that is, local noether transformations are
unphysical and describe a redundancy of the true degrees
of freedom of the system 6. gauge transformations de-
pend on arbitrary functions and are constructed from
rst class constraints. here we state some considerations
and results about both types of symmetries.

a. noether rigid transformations

the conserved quantity g in t q  r associated with
a rigid noether transformation initially dened in t qr
is a solution of our general conditions (3.16) and (3.17).
we know that (3.16) contains information as to whether
the associated noether transformation is projectable to
phase space or not. in case it is not, in order to get a
projectable noether transformation one may try the fol-
lowing. let us add to g a generator, say g, of a gauge
transformation where the values of the arbitrary func-
tions have been previously xed as constants. since the
generators of gauge transformations are combinations of
constraints (see next subsection), the value on shell of the
conserved quantity remains unaltered. it is then possible
that a convenient choice of g makes the noether trans-
formation generated by g + g projectable.

we will not discuss the question of the existence of
rigid noether symmetries. this problem is closely re-
lated with the integrability of the dynamical system at
hand. a typical example can be constructed in the case
of autonomous systems, where the energy is a constant
of motion. in eld theory, the explicit independence of
the lagrangian with respect to the space-time variables
leads to the existence of a conserved energy-momentum
tensor. here also the associated noether transforma-
tion can be non-projectable, and the resulting energy-
momentum tensor may not be gauge invariant. in some
cases, though, by adding the appropriate gauge gener-
ator, it is possible to construct a projectable noether
symmetry whose associated energy-momentum tensor is
gauge invariant [29,30].

as an example of a rigid transformation that is non-
projectable, consider the case of an autonomous sys-
tem with canonical hamiltonian hc. in the place of g,

6this sharp statement that distinguishes what is physical
from what is not, must be rened in the context of eld theory,
because of the possible existence of degrees of freedom at the
boundaries

13

0 = 0

hc itself satises (3.16) and (3.17) with a0 = 0 and
b0
0 (indices 0 are only available if there are
rst class constraints at the canonical primary level).
hence hc generates a noether transformation that is not
projectable to phase space, an exception being made, of
course, in the case when all the primary constraints are
second class among themselves. the fact that the matrix
b is dierent from zero prevents the associated q from
being projectable. let us be more specic. considering
the innitesimal conserved quantity g = t hc, with t
an innitesimal parameter, we have, according to (3.23),

qj = fl{qj, t hc} + t v0 j

0 ,

where we have used the values for a0 and b0
0 deter-
mined above. using the denition of the dirac bracket,
we can write qj as

qj = fl{qj, t hc} + t fl1

= t(cid:0)fl{qj, hc} + +v0j

= t( qj + [l]ibij),

1 + t v0 j
c j

0  m 11 1 j

1(cid:1)

(6.1)

for

the antisymmetric quantity bij

where we have used the identity (2.5), and where
bij
stands
:=
1 m 11 j
i
1 . so, except for a trivial piece, the transfor-
mation qj is just qj = t qj, that is, the innitesimal
time translation, as it must be.

a lesson may be drawn from this rather simple ex-
ploration: the existence of a rigid noether conserved
quantity does not guarantee that its associated noether
transformation is projectable to the canonical formalism.
in connection with the results of the preceding section,
we may also note in this example that, since the matrix
b associated to the hamiltonian is a multiple of the iden-
tity, this matrix will commute with any other matrix b1
associated with another non-projectable noether trans-
formation. that is, the second term in the right side of
(5.4) and (5.6) will vanish. in particular, taking gl
1 and
2 := flhc, then it turns
gl
out that gl

2 from (5.5), and letting gl

(2,1) in (5.6) is

gl

(2,1) =

gl
1
t

.

this is an expected result for any time independent la-
grangian: the explicit time derivative of a conserved
noether quantity is also a conserved noether quantity.

b. noether gauge transformations. existence

theorems

the generators of noether gauge transformations are
combinations of rst class constraints (with respect to
the nal constraint surface). they have the general form
[8,1821]

g = g

1 + g

2 + . . . ,

that depends on some combinations g
2 , . . . of rst
class constraints, and the arbitrary functions  and their
time derivatives. to construct these generators for a
given theory, it is convenient to solve rst the full sta-
bilization algorithm, in order to determine the rst class
constraints needed in g.

1 , g

the presence of the arbitrary functions  in the gener-
ators of noether gauge transformations makes them very
versatile, for we can redene these arbitrary functions
with changes of the type

 = f 

 ,

with f 
 (q, p, t) a given set of functions, and  playing
now the role of new arbitrary functions. this redenition
of the arbitrary functions amounts to a change of the ba-
sis of constraints used in the expansion of the generators.
the usefulness of such changes of basis is twofold: on one
side, they modify the algebraic structure of the genera-
tors of the gauge group [24], and hence one can pass from
an open algebra to a closed one, or one can even end
up with an abelianized algebra. on the other side,
they may help to make the transformations projectable
to phase space. an interesting example of this last ap-
plication is that of the gauge group of dieomorphism-
induced transformations in generally covariant theories
with a metric [25]: in order to have these transforma-
tions projectable to phase space it is compulsory that
the original arbitrary functions of the spacetime dieo-
morphisms include some precise dependence on the lapse
and shift functions (components of the metric in a 3 + 1
decomposition).

in general, with regard to gauge transformations, we
must distinguish the case where all constraints are rst
class from the others. in this case, it is proven in [26]
that, under some standard regularity conditions (con-
stancy of the rank of the hessian matrix and absence of
ineective constraints), noether canonical gauge trans-
formations do exist and with the right number to describe
all the gauge freedom available to the system, that is,
the number of nal rst class primary constraints. as a
matter of fact, the proof in [26] is not completely general
but is only valid for cases with at most quaternary con-
straints (three steps of the stabilization algorithm being
sucient), but the proof is easily extended to cover the
general case.

similar results are obtained within the enlarged for-
malism of section 4 for theories with rst class con-
straints and satisfying the same regularity conditions.
in such case, as proven in [3], generalized gauge trans-
formations, depending upon the variables , , , ..., al-
ways exist. the freedom to choose, in this case, the basis
for the primary constraints, has the price of the appear-
ance of dependence on the lagrange multipliers and their
derivatives. a careful choice of the basis for the primary
constraints allows for solutions for the gauge generators
independent of , in agreement with the results of [26].
in case second class constraints are present, the the-
orems in [26] prove that there are still canonical gauge

transformations that map solutions of the equations of
motion into other solutions, and in the right number,
but there is no guarantee that the action is conserved
up to boundary terms. the diculty to get a proof for
the existence of canonical noether gauge symmetries in
this general case lies in the structure of the stablilization
algorithm, as we now discuss.

in [27] the authors claim to have solved in full general-
ity the problem of existence of gauge transformations for
theories containing second class constraints. in that pa-
per it is taken for granted (formulas (9) and (11) of [27])
that a basis for the rst class constraints exists, m
 ;
where  numbers the level of the stabilization algorithm:
primary ( = 1), secondary ( = 2), etc., m numbers
the constraints in the level ; such that, together with
a rst class canonical hamiltonian, hf c , the following
relations hold (the notation is the same as in [27,28]):

{m
{m

 , hf c } = gmm
 , m

  m
 ,
 } = f mm m
m
 .

  

(6.2)

but this assumption is not proven, neither in [27] nor in
a preceding paper [28]. in principle one could think that
(6.2) is a simple consequence of the fact, rst proved by
dirac [10], that the poisson bracket between rst class
objects is also rst class. this is true, of course, but the
contents of (6.2) is much more restrictive. indeed, one
must take into account that any product of two secondary
constraints is also rst class, and therefore one has, if 
stands generically for a secondary constraint,

{m
{m

 , hf c } = gmm
 , m

  m
 } = f mm m

  

 + o()2,
m

 + o()2,

(6.3)

where o()2 stands for any piece quadratic in the sec-
ondary constraints. it is not dicult to get rid of these
quadratic pieces for the poisson bracket of the -level
rst class constraints with the rst class hamiltonian,
simply by dening the ( + 1)-level rst class constraints
as the results of these poisson bracket and disregard-
ing the redundant constraints that may result. but
then we cannot prevent the poisson bracket of rst class
constraints from developing quadratic pieces in the sec-
ondary constraints. or vice-versa, we can write the con-
straints, if they are all eective, in a new basis such that
all are canonical variables, a darboux basis. in such
case, the poisson bracket between rst class constraints
has no quadratic pieces -it just vanishes- but nothing
prevents these quadratic pieces from being present in the
poisson bracket of the rst class constraints with the rst
class hamiltonian.

since the assumption (6.2) seems instrumental in ob-
taining the existence theorems for noether gauge trans-
formations, we must therefore assert that there has not
yet been produced a general proof of the existence of
canonical noether gauge symmetries for systems with
rst as well as second class constraints. nevertheless, we

14

are going to prove in the next subsection a theorem of ex-
istence for canonical noether gauge transformations for
general theories having only primary and secondary con-
straints, that is, theories whose stabilization algorithm
has only one step. since most of the physical cases, like
general relativity or yang-mills theories, fall into this
case, we can say that our results, though incomplete, do
have some interest.

c. existence of canonical noether gauge
transformations for theories with one-step

stabilization algorithm

consider a theory satisfying our standard regularity
conditions, with canonical hamiltonian hc, and with a
set of primary constraints. we classify them into rst
and second class. next we look for the secondary con-
straints, which we will suppose to be eective. they
introduce new restrictions to the primary constraint sur-
face, so that they are dened up to the addition of pri-
mary constraints. and suppose, also, that there are no
more levels (tertiary,...) of constraints. some of the sec-
ondary constraints make second class some of the former
rst class primary constraints. the rest of the secondary
constraints, chosen in a convenient basis, will be rst
class. by changing the basis for the primary and sec-
ondary constraints and performing a subsequent canoni-
cal transformation, we can express all the constraints in
a darboux basis,

p rimary : p1, ..., pm, pm+1, ..., pn, pn+1, ..., pn+r,

qn+1, ..., qn+r.

secondary : p 

1, ..., p 

l , qm+1, ..., qn.

p1, ..., pm are the nal rst class primary constraints,
pm+1, ..., pn are the former rst class primary constraints
that become second class when the secondary constraints
are introduced. pn+1, ..., pn+r, qn+1, ..., qn+r are cou-
ples of canonical variables corresponding to the primary
second class constraints. p 
l , with l  m, are the
secondary rst class constraints, and qm+1, ..., qn are
the secondary second class constraints that make the pri-
mary subset pm+1, ..., pn second class.

1, ..., p 

since the canonical hamiltonian is only determined up
to primary constraints, we can, without any lost of gen-
erality, set to zero in hc the variables corresponding to
the primary constraints. notice that, since the poisson
bracket between rst class objects is also rst class, we
will have, for this new hc,

{pi, hc} = aa

i p 

a + dst

i qsqt,

for some matrices (of functions) aa
i and dst
a = 1, ..., l, s, t = m + 1, ..., n. aa
i
matrix. if l < m, aa
0,  = l + 1, ..., m.

i has m  l null vectors c i

i ; i = 1, ..., m,
is a maximum rank
i =

, c i

aa

having done all these preliminaries, nding m inde-
pendent canonical noether gauge quantities enclosed in
g, g = i(t)gi, i = 1, ..., m., with i arbitrary functions,
becomes trivial. they are,

ga = p 

a, a = 1, ...l;

g = c i

pi,  = l + 1, ..., m.

it is trivial to check (3.19) and (3.20) for all these quan-
tities. the coecients a0 in (3.19) vanish for g but
not necessarily for ga. since b0
0 = 0 for all ga, g,
we know by (3.38) that their associated noether trans-
formations are canonical.

thus we have arrived at the following result: any the-
ory with only primary and secondary constraints (all ef-
fective) exhibits a basis of independent canonical noether
gauge generators in a number that equals the number of
nal primary rst class constraints

this proof of existence of noether gauge transforma-
tions cannot be easily generalized to theories whose sta-
bilization algorithm has more than one step. of course
one can prepare the constraints in a darboux basis,
where conditions (3.20) can be readily met. but the un-
solved problem is to nd the right number of objects,
combinations of rst class constraints, satisfying (3.19).
this is still an open problem.

vii. examples

a. example 1: dirac hamiltonian

for any time independent rst order lagrangian, the
dirac hamiltonian hd (4.2), which is also time inde-
pendent, satises the condition (4.3) to be a genera-
tor of noether transformations. these transformations,
cq = {q, thd} become, in tangent space,

qi := (cqi)|(p= p,=v)

= t(fl{qi, hc} + vfl{qi, })
= t(kqi) = qit.

this is an expected result that was already discussed in
the context of non-projectable rigid noether symmetries
in subsection 6.1

b. example 2: presence of terms quadratic in the

constraints

having theorems that guarantee the existence of gauge
noether transformations is not the same as nding them
in practice. writing the constraints in a darboux basis
may prove cumbersome, and in many cases it is advan-
tageous to circumvent these procedures and to obtain
the noether conserved quantities from simpler consid-
erations. here we consider an example exhibiting rst
and second class constraints. it illustrates some special

15

features that are absent in the case with only rst class
constraints. our hamiltonian is

hc =

1
2

(p2

1 + p2

2),

where p1 and p2 are vectors in minkowski space. the
primary constraints are the following scalar products

1 = (p1, x2) = 0,

2 = (p2, x2) = 0,

where x2 is the vector whose components are the canoni-
cal coordinates conjugate to those of p2. the correspond-
ing lagrangian is

l =

1
2

( x2

1 

( x1x2)2

x2
2

) +

1
2

( x2

2 

( x2x2)2

x2
2

).

both constraints are rst class on the primary surface,
and {1, 2} = 1. their stabilization gives the sec-
ondary constraints:

1 = {1, hc} = (p1, p2),

2 = {2, hc} = p2
2.

no more constraints appear. notice that {1, 1} = p2
1.
therefore, if we restrict ourselves to a region in phase
space with p2
1 6= 0, the constraints 1 and 1 become
second class. for a correct denition of l, we will also
assume that our region satises x2

2 6= 0.

1 = b2

the obvious candidate for a conserved quantity g as-
sociated with a noether gauge transformation is the sec-
ondary constraint 2, which is a nal rst class con-
straint. in fact, g = (t)2, with (t) an arbitrary func-
tion, satises (3.19) and (3.20) with a1 = a2 = 0 and
b1
2 = 2. thus, we have at hand the identication
of the noether transformation q associated with g, just
by using (3.23). since flb0
0 6= 0, we know by (3.38)
that q is not projectable. our experience with theo-
ries with only rst class constraints tells us that to get a
projectable q we may try to replace (t) by a function
 = (t)f (q, p) with  arbitrary and f to be determined
so as to render b0
0 = 0. this substitution amounts to
a change of basis for the secondary rst class constraint.
but this substitution does not works in our case. the
subtle point is that the change of basis 2  f 2 is not
general enough, that is, we have not fully used the free-
dom to modify g. in fact, the square of the secondary
second class constraint 1 is rst class( because any inef-
fective constraint is). therefore, we may add to g a term
linear in (1)2,that is, we can take g = (t)(f 2 +g(1)2).
now we can nd simple solutions for f and g that make
b0

0 = 0, for instance

g = (t)(x2

2p2

12  x2

2(1)2).

the values of a1 and a2, according to (3.19), for this
g, may be used to obtain, by means of (3.29), the canon-
ical generator g of a projectable q. we get

g = (t)(x2

2p2

12  x2

2(1)2) + (t)(x2

2p2

12  x2

211).

notice that all terms use constraints that are rst class,
though some are the product of nal second class con-
straints. had we not considered these quadratic pieces,
we would have not a canonical generator of a projectable
noether gauge transformation. obviously these special
features disappear if we use a darboux basis for the
constraints, but it is harder to get this basis than to pro-
ceed along our lines.

c. example 3: a non-projectable noether

transformation

as an example which exhibits a non-projectable

noether transformation, we take the lagrangian

l =

1
2

q2
1 +

1
2q4

q2
2 +

1
2

q2
3 +

1
2

q2
2 + q3q5,

(7.1)

which diers from the example presented in [27] by a sim-
ple canonical transformation. the primary constraints
are p4 = 0 and p5 = 0. the canonical hamiltonian is

hc =

1
2

p2
1 +

1
2

q4p2

2 +

1
2

p2
3 

1
2

q2
2  q3q5

(7.2)

the stabilization of p4 = 0 give rise to the chain of rst
class constraints

1 = p4, 2 = 

1
2

p2
2, 3 = q2p2, 4 = q2

2  q4p2
2,

while the stabilization of p5 = 0 only gives rise to second
class constraints:

1 = p5, 2 = q3, 3 = p3, 4 = q5.

using the dirac bracket we can eliminate the canonical
pairs (q3, p3) and (q5, p5) though it is not necessary. a
solution to our fundamental conditions (3.19) and (3.20)
is

g = 2(  4q4)  3  + 4,

(7.3)

...
with a =
 4q4  and b = 4. since b 6= 0 the genera-
tor has an associated non-projectable noether symmetry.
it is easy to show that in this case it is not possible to
use a redenition of the constraint surface to render the
corresponding transformation projectable. notice that,
in particular, the transformation q4 = a + 4 q4 is not
canonically generated. nevertheless, we can use the en-
larged formalism of section 4 to dene a canonical gen-
erator gc of this non-projectable noether symmetry. to
accomplish this we promote the lagrange multiplier 
associated to the primary rst class constraint p4 = 0
to a dynamical variable  that is, we work in the en-
larged formalism  and use the relation (4.5) to dene
a canonical generator

gc = g + (4  a)p4.

(7.4)

16

this canonical generator satises equation (4.3) ( the
dirac hamiltonian is hd = hc + p4. the canonical
transformation cq4 generated by gc, cq4 = 4  a, co-
incides with the previous non-canonical symmetry upon
the substitution  = q4, p4 = 0 that comes from the
equations of motion for p4 and , respectively. this is
an expected result according to the general arguments
introduced in section 4.

d. example 4: abelian chern-simons eld theory in

2n + 1 dimensions

here we present, as a eld theory example, the generic
abelian chern-simons theory in 2n + 1 dimensions
[31,32]. we use some results of [32] and, mostly, their
notation. our treatment diers from [32] in that we re-
tain all the variables, including a0.

abelian chern-simons theory has only primary and
secondary constraints; therefore, in principle, a noether
gauge generator can be constructed. one must be aware
that in some eld theories the basis of constraints to
achieve this goal can be involved. indeed, there are cases
where the noether generator is a non-local function, as
in the canonical formulation of the electromagnetic du-
ality transformation (see for example [33]). in our case,
however, our procedures will not meet these diculties.

the lagrangian density is

l2n+1

cs = 01...2na0 f12 . . . f2n12n ,

(7.5)

p0 :=

pi :=

l2n+1

cs

 a0

l2n+1

cs
 ai

= 0,

= li,

whereby we can read o the primary hamiltonian con-
straints

0 := p0 = 0,

i := pi  li = 0.

(7.8)

(these equalities to zero are weak equalities in the dirac
sense: they are part of the equations of motion) the
canonical hamiltonian is determined only up to terms
linear in the primary constraints. a simple choice is

hc = a0(k + ipi).

(7.9)

(this hamiltonian diers from the one taken in [32] by
terms linear in the primary constraints). at this point,
the dynamics is determined by the vector eld in phase
space

xh =


t

+ {, hc} + {, }.

(7.10)

let us obtain, for future use, the lagrangian determi-
nation v of the lagrange multipliers , as discussed in
section 2. since the time derivatives of the conguration
variables a are

a0 = xh(a0) = 0,

ai = xh(ai) = ia0 + i,

where the greek indices  run from 0 to 2n, f :=
a a and 01...2n is totally antisymmetric with
012...,2n = 1. the noether gauge invariance for l2n+1
is
given by

cs

we nd

v0 = a0,

vi = f0i.

(7.11)

a =  + f  ,

(7.6)

where  and  are innitesimal arbitrary functions
(the usual dieomorphisms are recovered by taking  =
a ).

eventhough there is no metric, we take, as it is cus-
tomary, the x0 coordinate as the time evolution parame-
does not depend on a0, it is convenient
ter. since l2n+1
to identify in (7.5) the terms containing a0. the la-
grangian is equivalently written as (the latin indices i
run from 1 to 2n)

cs

l2n+1

cs = a0k + (0ai  ia0)li,

(7.7)

with

and

k := 0i1...i2n fi1i2 . . . fi2n1i2n ,

these functions v0, vi are clearly non-projectable to
phase space because the hessian matrix for l2n+1
van-
ishes identically (the lagrangian is linear in the ve-
locities) and therefore the vectors  in (2.1) are now
 = 
 a

cs

.

we have the following poisson brackets:

{0, i} = 0,
{i, j } = 2n(n + 1)0iji3...i2n fi3i4 . . . fi2n1i2n =: ij
{0, hc} = k + ipi =: 0
{i, hc} = 0.

(7.12)

the stabilization algorithm for the primary constraint
0 = 0 gives the secondary constraint 0 = 0. the other
primary constraints give

0 = i = xhi = ijj.

(7.13)

li := 2n0iji3...i2n ajfi3 i4 . . . fi2n1i2n .

to continue, it is necessary to know the rank of the ma-
trix ij . the identity

(notice that ili = nk) we can go to the hamiltonian
formulation. the lagrangian momenta are

ijfjk = (n + 1)i

kk,

(7.14)

17

is telling us, taking into account that

(n + 1)k = 0  ii,

that neither ij nor fjk can have rank 2n, on shell.
from now on we will work in the region of congura-
tion space where the theory is generic [32], that is, fik
has the maximum rank compatible with the equations of
motion. this maximum rank is 2n  2. we take [32] co-
ordinates xi = x, xp;  = 1, 2; p = 3, . . . , 2n., such that
the maximum rank condition is attained by fpq, that is,
det(fpq) 6= 0.

dene f pq as the matrix inverse to fpq. equation
(7.14) implies the on shell (that is, when k = 0) rela-
tionship

the coecient b in (3.20) vanishes. for pp the co-
ecient a vanishes and bq
0 = pf pq. thus the trans-
formations generated by pp are not projectable. this
non-projectability suggests us to work in the enlarged
formalism. let

g := 00 + pp,

the quantity g in (3.25) becomes (0 =

then,
0, 0 = 0):

g = 00  00 + pp

= 00  00 + p(p  p)
= 00  00 + p(p + fqf qp),

(7.17)

ip = ifqf qp,

where we have used the rst identity in (7.15). finally,
the generator gc in (4.5) is

that shows that the maximum rank for ij is 2, on shell.
indeed this rank is attained by . dening its inverse
matrix as , we can write, using (7.14), the identities

gc = 00  00 + p(p + fqf qp + qf qp0),

(7.18)

fqf qp + p = 0,
pq  pq = (n + 1)f pqk

(7.15)

and it is straightforward to prove that gc satises equa-
tion (4.3). it is convenient to redene the arbitrary func-
tions p as p = fpqq. then

that will be used below.

the preceding analysis shows that, being the theory
generic, the only primary second class constraints are 1
and 2. the dirac bracket is then dened as

{, } = {, }  {, }{, }.

the lagrangian multipliers 1 and 2 become deter-
mined by (7.13). recalling (3.39), the new evolution op-
erator is

gc = 00  00 + q(fpqp + fq + q0), (7.19)

recalling the lagrangian determination (7.11) for q, we
can write the gauge transformations generated by gc,
(4.1),

a0 = {a0, gc}|(=v) =  0 + f0qq
a = {a, gc}|(=v) = 0 + fqq
ap = {ap, gc}|(=v) = p0 + fpqq,

(7.20)

x1

h =


t

+ {, hc} + p{, p} + 0{, 0}.

or, in a more compact way,

our next task is to nd the noether gauge generators.
our chern-simons theory exhibits a special circumstance
which is worth mentioning: in contrast to the standard
case developed in section 3, our primary rst class con-
straints only close (to exhibit their rst class condition)
when the secondary constraint is also taken into account.
this is due to the fact that in the determination of the
rank of ij (in the generic case) use has been made of
the secondary constraint. nevertheless, since the closure
of the primary rst class constraints only involves the
secondary constraint our theory still applies, as we will
see. using the second identity in (7.15) we compute this
closure property. it reads:

{p, q} = (n + 1)f pqk = f pq0 + pc.

(7.16)

now we can look for the gauge generators. it is clear
that 00 and pp, with 0, p arbitrary functions, sat-
isfy the requirements for the function g in (3.19) and
(3.20). for 00 the coecient a in (3.19) is 0 and

18

a = 0 + fqq.

(7.21)

the time dieomorphism and the dieomorphims in
the x1 and x2 directions are hidden in (7.21). to nd
them, one must consider the lagrangian equations of mo-
tion,

ij f0j = 0.

(they can be read o from (7.13) after using the la-
grangian determination (7.11) for j).
since a ba-
sis for the null vectors for ij is already spanned by
fjp, p = 3, 4, . . . , 2n., we conclude that there exist ma-
trices n q

0 such that, on shell,

, n q

f = n q

fq,

f0 = n q

0 fq.

(7.22)

then, since q are arbitrary functions, they can be ex-
pressed as

q = q + n q

 + n q

1. counting the degrees of freedom

(7.23)

we have recovered the complete set of gauge transforma-
tions (7.6) that in fact are true noether transformations,
on and o shell. obviously they are not all indepen-
dent: the time and the x1, x2 dieomorphisms can be
obtained either by using the arbitrary functions , 0
or as a byproduct of the xp diemorphisms, as we have
just seen. the reason for this is the fact that the dynam-
ics introduces relations between the components of the
curvature tensor f that produce a redundancy in the
action on shell of the algebra of dieomorphisms. thus,
the gauge algebra is reducible on shell. this is a well
known fact that, in the language of brst methods [34],
implies the introduction of ghosts for ghosts in the for-
malism. indeed, the transformations (7.23) are reducible
on shell because, if we take

a = r ,

(7.24)

with r = f , then there exist matrices z 

, z 

0 , with

z 

 = (0, 

, n p

),

0 = (1, 0, n p
z 
0 )

such that, according to (7.22), the following relations
hold on shell,

z 

r = 0,

z 

0 r = 0.

this redundancy has been expressed in a non covariant
form. a full covariant treatment can be given by notic-
ing that the covariant form of the equations of motion
(including the constraint k = 0) is

q := 1...2n f12 . . . f2n12n = 0.

( q0 = 0 is k = 0, qi = 0 is ij f0j = 0) if we dene

 := 3 4...2n f34 . . . f2n12n ,

the following identity holds:

f =

1
2n

(

 q  

q).

then, the covariant expression for the reducibility of the
gauge transformations (7.24) is expressed, on shell, as

r = 0.

a) in tangent space.
here we present an alternative counting [32] of the de-
grees of freedom for the abelian chern-simons theory.
since most of our noether gauge transformations are not
projectable, we will study the gauge xing procedure in
the lagrangian formalism as discussed in [35]. here we
will ignore the fact that the lagrangian is linear in the
velocities and we will apply standard machinery. first
we count the lagrangian constraints in the usual sense,
that is, constraints involving conguration and velocity
k = 0 and ijf0j = 0. this
variables. they are k = 0,
amounts for for a total of 2n + 2 lagrangian constraints.
now we must introduce new constraints in order to elimi-
nate the gauge freedom. the independent gauge degrees
of freedom are described by the arbitrary functions 0
and p in (7.21); these functions must be xed by intro-
ducing the gauge xing constraints. this means we must
introduce 2(n  1) + 1 new constraints to x the dynam-
ics. at this point there is still a redundancy in the setting
of the initial conditions (residual gauge freedom, see [35]
for details) because, at any given time t0, the function
0 is an independent function and one can verify there
are still gauge motions that preserve the gauge xing
constraints. a new gauge xing constraint is necessary.
thus, we have introduced a total of 2(n  1) + 2 = 2n
gauge xing constraints. the nal number of constraints
is, therefore, 4n + 2. this number equals the dimension
(in the sense of eld theory) of the tangent space. there
are no local degrees of freedom.
b) in conguration space.
since the lagrangian equations of motion are linear in
the velocities, the real setting of the initial conditions is
in conguration space. so let us do things better: we
will only consider constraints in conguration space (we
will call them cs-constraints). the theory only provides
with one such a constraint, namely k = 0.

using the rst relation in (7.15) (we always consider

the theory to be generic), the equations of motion,

can be written as

ij f0j = 0,

f0 = f0qf qpfq.

thus, f0q and a0 are arbitrary. dening (to coincide
with the notation used in the hamiltonian analysis)

this expression is in its turn reducible because, on shell,

0 := a0,

p := ap  pa0 = f0p,

f  = 0,

and the tower of reducibility continues indenitely. this
fact was already noticed in [32]. since in our approach
we retain all the variables (that is, including a0), our
description is fully covariant.

we can express the evolutionary vector eld in a way
that encodes all the arbitrariness through these functions
0, p:

xl =


t

+0



a0

+(p+pa0)



ap

+(a0+pf pqfq)



a

.

as usual, the gauge xing procedure has two steps: x-
ing the arbitrariness in the dynamics and xing the re-
dundancy in the initial conditions. to x the dynamics
we need to introduce as many gauge xing cs-constraints
as arbitrary functions in xl, that is, 2(n  1) + 1 cs-
constraints. once the dynamics is xed we must con-
sider the residual gauge freedom that is still available in
the setting of the initial conditions. the same argument
used before makes it necessary an additional gauge x-
ing cs-constraint [35]. now the gauge freedom has been
completely eliminated. we end up with 2n gauge xing
cs-constraints to be added to the original cs-constraint
k = 0. the nal number of cs-constraints, 2n+ 1, equals
the dimension of conguration space. again, there are no
local degrees of freedom.

e. example 5: pure electromagnetism

in this example we consider the construction of the
gauge symmetry in pure electromagnetism. from the
lagrangian

l = 

1
4

f f 

we get a canonical hamiltonian,

hc =z dx(cid:20) 1

2

(2 + b2) +   a0(cid:21) ,

with bk =  1
2 0kij fij , and a primary constraint (coming
from the denition of the momenta) 0 = 0. stability of
this constraint under the hamiltonian dynamics leads to
the secondary constraint 0 = {0, hc} =    = 0,
and no more constraints arise. both constraints are rst
class, so we can directly apply the existence theorem of
subsection 6.3 to claim that

g =z dx (x, t)  

is a noether conserved quantity satisfying (3.16) and
(3.17), with  an arbitrary function. coecients in (3.19)
and (3.20) are, in this case, a =  , b = 0. the trans-
formation (3.23) becomes

a = ,

which is canonically generated by

g = g  a0 = z dx .

this gauge generator, g, satises, by construction,
(3.31) and (3.32).

viii. conclusions

in this paper we give results concerning the formula-
tion of noether symmetries, either in the tangent space
or in the phase space for some conguration space of a
dynamical system that may contain gauge freedom.

the conserved quantities associated with the noether
symmetries are characterized in the phase space, and we
show the role played by the dirac bracket structure for
this characterization. we also give a geometric property
that must be satised by a noether conserved quantity in
the tangent space in order that the associated noether
transformation be projectable to phase space.
in such
case, the noether transformation becomes a canonical
transformation.

we introduce the enlarged formalism (that includes the
lagrange multipliers as independent variables) as a wider
framework to deal with generalized noether symmetries.
a general formula is obtained that fully characterizes the
conserved quantities associated to these symmetries. we
also show how to bring these noether symmetries in the
enlarged formalism to the original lagrangian.

the algebra for the set of noether transformations is
also discussed, and it is pointed out that the closure of
the algebra of generators under the poisson bracket in
phase space does not guarantee the closure of the com-
mutator of transformations in conguration space. this
means that sometimes the presence of an open algebra
structure will be just an artifact of the pullback from the
phase space description to the description in congura-
tion space.

noether transformations in general can be rigid or
gauge. we discuss some aspects of both types of sym-
metries and, in the gauge case, we give a general proof of
the existence of the right number of independent noether
gauge transformations for theories with rst and second
class constraints with a stabilization algorithm that does
not exhibit tertiary constraints. it is still an open prob-
lem to prove the existence of the right number of indepen-
dent noether gauge transformations for general theories
with an undetermined number of steps in the stabiliza-
tion algorithm.

the generality of the enlarged formalism suggests us
that it is the most general framework to deal with
noether symmetries, that is, that any noether symme-
try can be cast into the general formula (4.3). work is
in progress to prove this assertion [36].

we present some examples to illustrate the application
of our results. of particular interest are examples 2 and
4. the rst because it exhibits a generator of noether
gauge transformations that must include terms that are
quadratic in the constraints, which is uncommon. the
second because it is an example of a eld theory that has
a relevant role in the modern developments in quantum
eld theory.

we have worked under standard regularity assump-
tions: the constancy of the rank of the hessian matrix

20

and the existence of a splitting of the primary constraints
into rst and second class on the primary constraint sur-
face. under these assumptions, here we list our main
results as presented in the text (except for result 5, that
only needs the rst assumption ):

1. the necessary and sucient condition for a func-
tion g  t q  r to be a noether canonical con-
served quantity, that is, such that its pullback gl
to t q  r satises

[l]iqi +

for some q, is that g must satisfy

{g, 0 } = sc + pc,

g

+ {g, hc} = sc + pc

where pc (sc) stands generically for primary (sec-
ondary) constraints.
(section 3, subsection 3.1)

2. the noether transformation is reconstructed from

g through

qi = fl{qi, g}  (fla0 + v0 flb0

0 and a0 are the coecients of the sc

where b0
terms in the preceding expression.
(section 3, subsection 3.2)

3. a noether transformation in phase space is always

a canonical transformation.
(section 3, subsection 3.2)

4. the necessary and sucient condition for a la-
grangian noether conserved function gl to be as-
sociated through

[l]iqi +

dgl

with a transformation qi that is projectable to
phase space is that gl must give zero when acted
upon by the vector elds in the kernel of the presym-
plectic form in tangent space.
(section 3, subsection 3.3)

5. the necessary and sucient condition for a func-

tion gc(q, p, , , , ...; t) to generate through

cqi = {qi, gc},

cpi = {pi, gc},

a noether symmetry in the enlarged formalism is
that gc must satisfy

dgc
dt

+ {gc, hd} = pc

where pc stands generically for primary constraints
and

d

+ ... ,

(section 4)

6. a sucient condition for the commutation rela-
tions of the projectable noether transformations in
conguration space to coincide with the poisson
bracket relations of their generators in phase space
is that at least all but one of the generators are lin-
ear in the momenta.
(section 5)

7. the existence of a rigid noether conserved quan-
tity does not guarantee that its associated noether
transformation is projectable to the canonical for-
malism.
(section 6, subsection 6.1)

8. any theory with only primary and secondary con-
straints (all eective) exhibits a basis of indepen-
dent canonical noether gauge generators in a num-
ber that equals the number of nal primary rst
class constraints.
(section 6, subsection 6.3)

appendix: auxiliary variables

consider a conguration space locally described by the
coordinates xa, yj. suppose a general lagrangian of the
form

l(xa, yj; xa, yj),

and suppose that the y variables are auxiliary variables,
that is, their equations of motion allow for the isolation
of these variables in terms of x and x,

[l]y = 0  y = y(x, x).

(the components of the two dimensional metric in the
polyakov string [37] are examples of such type of vari-
ables) then dene the reduced lagrangian lr as

lr(x, x, x) = l|y= y(x, x) .

we will prove that lr gives the right equations of motion
for the remaining variables x.

there is the following relationship between the equa-

tions of motion for lr and those for l,

[lr]x = [l]x|y= y(x, x)+

 y
x

[l]y |y= y(x, x) 

but since

[l]y|y= y(x, x) = 0

identically, we conclude that

d

 x

[l]y |y= y(x, x)(cid:19) ,

[lr]x = [l]x|y= y(x, x) .

this proves that the dynamics for the reduced variables
x is governed by the reduced lagrangian lr.

when we apply this result to section 4, the lagrangian
lc from which we start the reduction procedure does not
depend on the velocities y. the y variables are, in the
notations of section 4, p and .
