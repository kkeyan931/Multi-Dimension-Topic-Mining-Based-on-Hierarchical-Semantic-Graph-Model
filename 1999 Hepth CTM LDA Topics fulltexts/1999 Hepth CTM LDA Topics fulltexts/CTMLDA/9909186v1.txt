abstract

we construct the retarded green function and the hadamard function in the
lorentzian (d+1)-dimensional anti-de sitter spacetime for the poincare coordinate by
performing the mode integration directly. we explore the structure of singularities
for the position-space feynman propagator derived from them. the boundary scaling
limits of the bulk feynman propagator yield the bulk-boundary propagator and the
boundary conformal correlation function with an extra factor.

the maldacena conjecture has brought a renewed interest in the relationship between
the large n yang-mills theory and the string theory [1]. in particular the semiclassical limit
of iib superstring theory on ads5  s5 is related to the large n limit of n = 4 super yang-
mills theory. this ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] between the quantum gravity in the
anti-de sitter space and the conformal gauge theory on the boundary has been considered
in the euclidean space. the correlation functions for the boundary conformal theory have
been computed from the bulk dynamics in the ads space [4, 5, 6].

the ads/cft correspondence in the lorentzian spacetime and scattering processes have
been investigated [7, 8, 9, 10]. there are trials to extract the local and causal gravity
dynamics in the lorentzian ads spacetime from the boundary conformal eld theory [11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. from this view point the conformal correlation function is interpreted
as the s-matrix in the at space limit [12, 13] or some kind of the s-matrix [14, 15]. the
bulk massive scalar eld in the lorentzian ads spacetime is composed of the normalizable
propagating modes and the non-normalizable modes whose boundary values act as sources
for conformal operators in the boundary theory [8]. the normalizable modes are quantized
in the curved ads spacetime and vanish at the boundary. they correspond to states in the
hilbert space of the boundary conformal theory. generally there are many green functions
in a lorentzian curved spacetime. for the ads spacetime the feynman propagator of the
massive scalar eld in the momentum space has been presented as a sum of these normalizable
modes [14]. with respect to the retarded green function the conguration form in the (d+1)-
dimensional ads spacetime for the poincare coordinate has been derived by carrying out
the mode integration in the lower dimensions and taking advantage of a recursion relation
between the adsd1 green function and the adsd+1 one [17].

for the lorentzian two-dimensional ads spacetime the hadamard functions in the con-
guration space have been constructed by summing the normalizable modes about various
vacua which correspond to selections of the time coordinate [18]. the hadamard function
in the global vacuum or the poincare vacuum is expressed in terms of the sl(2,r)-invariant
distance variable, while in the boulware vacuum it is not so expressed. the short-distance
behaviors of the hadamard functions of massive scalars are investigated and the massless
limits of them are shown to yield the usual massless green functions on the strip or the half
plane that are described by logarithmic functions. from the short-distance behaviors the
vacuum expectation values of the stress tensors are studied in the various ads1+1 vacua.

we will try to construct the hadamard function in the lorentzian (d + 1)-dimensional
ads spacetime for the poincare coordinate. for that purpose, rst in the momentum rep-
resentation of the retarded green function we will perform the mode integration directly in
adsd+1 by using a recursion relation of the bessel functions. we will use this direct method
to determine the position-space hadamard function, which will be compactly described in
the dierential expressions. combining them we will derive the feynman propagator, which
is represented in the conguration space so that we can analyse what kinds of singularities
appear. we will demonstrate what happens in the (d + 1)-dimensional bulk feynman prop-
agator containing the heaviside functions, when one argument is taken to the boundary.
in this boundary scaling limit the bulk-boundary propagator of the lorentzian signature
version will be extracted.

we consider a massive scalar eld in the lorentzian (d + 1)-dimensional ads spacetime

expressed by the poincare coordinate (t, ~x, z) = (x, z), ds2 = r2/z2(dt2 + d~x2 + dz2), where
(t, ~x) spans the d-dimensional minkowski spacetime and 0  z   with a boundary at z = 0
and a horizon at z = . the general regular solution of the bulk wave equation is sum of a
uctuating normalizable mode solution, whose existence is a feature of lorentzian signature,
and a non-normalizable mode solution [8]. near the boundary the propagating mode behaves

as z2h+, while the non-uctuating mode as z2h with 2h = d/2  = d/2qm2r2 + d2/4

where m is mass of the scalar eld. hereafter we will set r = 1. for the poincare vacuum
the propagating bulk mode solution is expanded as

(z, x) = z dqdd1~kz

with 2 = q2 + k2 [14]. from the small z expansion of the bessel functions j(qz) we see that
the normalizable mode indeed vanishes as   zd/2+ at the boundary. the annihilation
operators bq~k dene the poincare vacuum |0 > as bq~k|0 >= 0 and obey the commutation
relations with the creation operators b

we begin with the retarded green function dened by gr(z, x; z, x) = (t  t)/2i <

in deriving this compact expression we have used (1  |v |) = (1  v )(1 + v ) and

zz is canceled. we have used the recursion relation of bessel functions, which prescription

will be extended in considering the general adsd+1 case.
1 + , the retarded green function is described as a function of the ads-invariant distance

a relation which is obtained by putting x2 = 0 in (3) and combining with (7). for massless

a factor (x2)1/2, which converts the operation d/ds + 1/2s into d/du or d/dv , in the

in terms of the invariant distance variable . the last two terms in (16) and (17) show
contributions from the spacelike separation. the timelike region is composed of two parts
which are characterized by (u  1) and (1  |v |).
for even d it is given by

now we are ready to compare the retarded green function gr and the feynman propaga-
tor gf in the lorentzian adsd+1 spacetime. we note that as shown in (12), (14) gr is zero
outside the light-cone. in ads2+1, gr (4) is supported in the timelike region  < 0 with no
delta-function singularity, while gr (6) in ads3+1 and gr (8) in ads4+1 have contributions
from not only the light-cone which contains coincident points and is specied by (v  1),
but also the timelike region which is specied by (u  1) and (1  |v |). moreover the
latter ones are singular on the reected light-cone as expressed by (u  1) or (v + 1), that
is ( + 2). this second possible singularity occurs at x2 + (z + z)2 = 0, which comes
from an image eld source at zi = z. on the other hand as seen in the last term in
(18) or (19) gf has additional nonzero contribution from the spacelike region specied by
v > 1, which originates in g(1). the feynman propagator in (18) for even d is singular at
u = 1 and v = 1 in view of q
in
p
 1
(19) has logarithmical singularities so that as d becomes larger through increasing dieren-
tiations gf contains more various combinations of singularities not only at the light-cone
v = 1, but also at the reected light-cone , u = 1 and v = 1. it is interesting to note
that the feynman propagator for the massless scalar  = 3/2 in ads3+1 can be expressed in
terms of a logarithmic function as

4 cos( cos1 v ) for |v | < 1 and so on. for odd d case q 1

this explicit expression indeed contains various combinations of the logarithmical, inverse
and delta-functions singularities at the light-cone and the reected light-cone.

let us take the boundary scaling limit z  0 for the obtained feynman propagator.
the leading part of the bulk feynman propagator for even d, when the spacelike separation
is chosen, is estimated as

igf (z, x; z, x)  i(x2 + z2)(1)

d
2

sin 2h+
2 sin 

z2h+gb(z, x; x)

(21)

with gb = (2h+)/(()d/2)(z/(x2 + z2))2h+, which is expressed as igf  i(x2 +
z2)z2h+gb/2. thus by taking a large v limit we have extracted the bulk-boundary prop-
agator gb from the last term in (18), which arises from g(1) alone. in this case the scaling
limit z  0 is eectively the same as the large spacelike distance limit. when a large u
limit is taken the rst term gives a scaling limit of igf for the timelike separation

igf (z, x; z, x)  i(x2  z2)ei sin 2h+

2 sin 

z2h+ gb(z, x; x)

(22)

with gb = (2h+)/(()d/2)(z/(x2  z2))2h+, where we have taken account of an
identity (x2  z2)(x2) = (x2  z2). it is also described by igf  i(x2 

7

z2)z2h+gb/2. this scaling limit is identical with the large timelike interval limit. whether
the boundary scaling limit is taken from the spacelike direction or the timelike direction, the
feynman propagator shows the same behavior. the phase factor ei plays a role to obtain
the same expression. furthermore, in the odd d case the last term in (19) gives the expression
(21) with (1)d/2/ sin  replaced by (1)(d1)/2/ cos  for the spacelike separation, from
which we have again igf  i(x2 + z2)z2h+gb/2, while the rst term provides the
expression (22) with i/ sin  replaced by 1/ cos  for the timelike separation, which
takes the form igf  i(x2  z2)z2h+gb/2. though the expression of the feynman
propagator depends on the dimension of ads spacetime, we have observed that the scaling
behaviors are the same for the even and odd dimensions, as shown by

igf  i((x2 + z2) + (x2  z2))z2h+gb/2 = iz2h+gb/2.

(23)

it is interesting that the two heaviside functions happen to combine into unity. we shoud
mention that this compact expression is presented up to the delta-function terms. thus from
the explicit form of the bulk feynman propagator we derive the bulk-boundary propagator,
however an extra factor 1/2 is accompanied. the factor 1/2 = 1/(4h+  d) was rst
emphasized in ref.
[15] by using an ads variant of the green theorem. it was argued in
the classical evaluation of the action for a massive scalar eld in the eulidean ads space for
the poincare coordinate [21]. recently in ref. [22] with respect to the global coordinate the
feynman propagator in the lorentzian adsd+1 spacetime has been investigated and from it
the bulk-boundary propagator has been extracted with the factor 1/2.

here we analyse the short-distance property of the hadamard function. if the exact form
of the symmetric function g(1) is known, it is possible to calculate the vacuum expectation
value of the square of scalar eld. for simplicity we will consider the ads2+1 spacetime.
in order to extract the short-distance property we must expand g(1) around v = 1. for
the spacelike separation  > 0 with v = 1 +  the last two terms in (16) yield g(1) 
()/2(1/2   + o()), where imaginary q
itself is expanded. for the timelike
separation  < 0 the second term in (16) also gives g(1)  ()/2 where real q
(v )
for |v | < 1 expressed in terms of a hypergeometric function is expanded by using a relation
between the hypergeometric function with argument v 2 and that with 1  v 2.
in this
evaluation we have seen that the singular terms of the form 1/2 are canceled out. but
in analysing the feynman propagator (18) with d = 2, the additional p
term yields
the singular term 1/2 for the timelike separation. by subtraction of the divergence in
the coincidence limit for the hadamard function g(1)  (()/2  )/2 we obtain a
regularized value < 0|2|0 > /4, whose negative sign is also seen in the squared-mass
term for the vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor in ads1+1 for the global vacuum

it was suggested that there is a simple relation o(x) = limz0 z(z, x) between a
quantum scalar bulk eld (z, x) and the corresponding dual boundary operator o(x) with
conformal dimension  = 2h+ [7, 14]. here combining this relation with (23) and taking
the remaining z to the boundary we have the conformal correlation function

for the ads/cft correspondence in the euclidean adsd+1 space the conformal two-point
function is given by < oe(x)oe(x) >= ((2  d)()/d/2(  d/2))|x  x|2, whose
extra factor (2  d) was derived by putting the boundary at z =  and taking  to 0
[2, 4] and further proved to be consistent with the ward identities [5]. this factor has
been argued from the dierent view point in ref. [21], where the boundary behavior of the
scalar eld is expressed as (z, x)  zd0(x) + za(x) where 0(x) is a source function.
the two-point function of the physical uctuation a(x), which rather corresponds to our
conformal eld o(x), has been presented as < a(x)a(x) >= (()/2d/2())|x x|2,
where the normalization a(x) = oe(x)/(2  d) is taken into account. this correlator in
the euclidean space for the poincare coordinate shows the same behavior as our obtained
correlation function (24) in the lorentzian spacetime.

by carrying out the mode integrations we have constructed the conguration forms of the
hadamard function and the feynman propagator in the (d + 1)-dimensional lorentzian ads
spacetime for the poincare coordinate. they are expressed in terms of an ads-invariant
distance variable. the construction of the hadamard function has been guided by the
experience with the direct evaluation of the retarded green function. though the real
retarded green function is described by the (associated) legendre functions of the rst
and second kinds, we have observed that the combined complex feynman propagator is
analytically described by only those of the second kind.

it has been shown that for the spacelike separation the retarded green function is zero,
while the feynman propagator indicates a power fall-o. this power behavior is compared
with the exponential tail of the feynman propagator for the large spacelike separation in the
at minkowski spacetime. the power fall-o in the spacelike ir limit is intimately connected
with the boundary scaling limit producing the bulk-boundary propagator. in the timelike ir
limit the feynman propagator shows the same power fall-o that is also associated with the
boundary scaling limit for the timelike separation. in the higher-dimensional ads spacetime,
owing to the increase of the dierential operations, the feynman propagator becomes more
singular and more involved with a variety of singularities.

we have seen that the evaluation of the hadamard function depends on the dimension
of ads spacetime, even or odd, corresponding to that of the retarded green function. for
the bulk feynman propagator, which is characterized by the heaviside functions that divide
the timelike and spacelike regions in the lorentzian ads spacetime, we have taken one
argument to the boundary and exhibited that it reduces to the bulk-boundary propagator
with a preferable factor 1/2. in this reduction the heaviside function dependence disappears
and there is no dierence between the even-dimensional case and the odd one. moreover
this factor is left intact in the two-point function of the dual boundary operator, when the
other argument is taken to the boundary.

though we have estimated the vacuum expectation value of the square of scalar eld,
it would be interesting to study that of the stress tensor from the obtained hadamard
function and ask how dierences appear between the even-dimensional ads case and the
odd one. the position forms of the feynman propagator and the hadamard function would
provide important tools with which to examine in greater detail the lorentzian ads/cft
correspondence from the dynamical view point.
