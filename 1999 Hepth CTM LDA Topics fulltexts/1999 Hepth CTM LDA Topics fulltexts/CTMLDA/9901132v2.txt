the graviton self-energy at nite temperature depends on
fourteen structure functions. we show that, in the absence
of tadpoles, the gauge invariance of the eective action im-
poses three non-linear relations among these functions. the
consequences of such constraints, which must be satised by
the thermal graviton self-energy to all orders, are explicitly
veried in general linear gauges to one loop order.

the non-linear relation imposed by gauge invariance on
the thermal self-energy of gluons, has been recently dis-
cussed by weldon in an interesting paper [1]. he proved
that in qcd, the slavnov-taylor identities [2,3] require
a non-linear constraint among the structure functions
which occur at nite temperature. in this brief report,
we show that a similar behavior occurs in the gauge the-
ory of gravity. in this case, local gauge invariance leads
to three non-linear relations which restrict the form of
the thermal self-energy of gravitons.

the einstein theory of gravity is described by the la-

grangian density [46]

l =

gr,

(1)

where 2 = 32g, g is the newton constant and r is
the ricci scalar. the graviton eld h can be dened in
terms of the metric tensor as

g =  + h.

(2)

using this parametrization, the einstein action will be
invariant under the gauge transformation [7]

where  is an innitesimal gauge parameter.

in this gauge theory, the corresponding identities
which occur at nite temperature, dier from those at
t = 0 because of the appearance of one-particle gravi-
ton functions (tadpoles). their thermal contribution is
purely leading, being proportional to t 2(n+1) at the n-
loop order. hence, we may assume that the tadpoles are
important, in the ward identities, only for the leading
thermal contributions to the graviton self-energy.
(to
one-loop order, for example, the tadpoles can be ne-
glected for the purpose of studying the sub-leading t 2,
log(t ) and t = 0 contributions).

at nite temperature, the graviton self-energy may
depend on the four-velocity u of the plasma, so that

1

in the hard thermal loop approximation, which repre-
sents a consistent high-temperature expansion [9,10], the
one loop graviton self-energy has leading contributions
proportional to t 4, and the corresponding functions (l)
j
are gauge invariant [8]. however, when one goes beyond
this approximation, by including contributions which are
sub-leading in powers of t , this feature no longer occurs
and the functions (s)

j become gauge dependent [11].

in order to investigate the structure of the exact gravi-
ton self-energy which includes also higher loops eects,
we will make use of the becchi-rouet-stora identities [12]
which reect the underlying gauge invariance of the the-
ory [13,14]. a discussion of the consequences of these
identities on the structure of the thermal self-energy is
given in appendix a. to explain these, we will denote
by ,  the quadratic part of the graviton eective ac-
tion, which is the sum of the free kinetic energy, without
the gauge xing term, and the one-particle-irreducible
graviton self-energy

,  = k (0)

,  + ,  .

(6)

the free-graviton kinetic energy is given, in momentum
space, by

k (0)
,  (k) = k2 ( +    )

+ kk + kk

(7)

 (kk + kk  + kk + kk)
of course, the contributions to ,  are calculated
according to the usual feynman rules, with a gauge xing
term in the bare propagator. hence, the gauge depen-
dence of ,  comes only from the self-energy func-
tions.
in consequence of the brs identities, it turns
out that the leading contributions to the longitudinal
part of ,  are proportional to the tadpole terms (see
eq. (a5)). furthermore, the sub-leading contributions
to ,  satisfy the following four constraints (see eq.
(a6))

= 0

for  = 0, 1, 2, 3,

(8)

(s) 



(k) g

 (k)(cid:12)(cid:12)h=0

where the tensor g

 is given, to lowest order, by (3).

since (s) 



is symmetric under permutations of in-
dices    and   , it can viewed as a 10  10
matrix which must have 10 eigenvalues. six of these are
determined dynamically by the equations of motion of the
gravitational eld. the other four eigenvalues must be
zero in consequence of the gauge invariance as expressed
by eq.
in order to obtain zero eigenvalues, it is
necessary that the determinant of (s) 
should vanish.
these requirements lead to three distinct non-linear con-
straints among the exact functions (s)
, which determine
the structure of the graviton self-energy at nite temper-
ature. the rst of these non-linear relations, which are
derived in appendix b, can be written as follows

(8).

(9)

the other general non-linear relations are given in eqs.
(b16) and (b17), which involve quite lengthy expressions.
we shall present here, for simplicity, only the correspond-
ing results obtained in covariant gauges, at zero temper-
ature. in this case, the general non-linear relations sim-
plify because in eq. (5), i = 0 for i 6= 4, 8, 12, 13. fur-
thermore, we have now a = b = c , since at zero
temperature the only traceless-transverse tensor avail-
able is given by the sum ta + tb + tc in (4). then,
the condition (b16) implies that 8 = 0, and the non-
linear constraint (b17) reduces to the following relation:

4 + 12 + 213 =

3

2k2 h412  (13)2i

(10)

the above non-linear relations are rather interesting,
since the structure functions i are all gauge-dependent.
in perturbation theory, these functions begin at least to
order 2. consequently, the linear combinations on the
left-hand sides of eqs. (9) and (10) must begin at or-
der 4. we have veried these results to one loop order
in general axial [15] and covariant gauges, respectively,
where the above linear combinations are found to vanish.

appendix a: brs identity

in order to derive the brs identity for the graviton
self-energy at nite temperature, we start from the eec-
tive action

 = h (0) +z d4xd4yj (x)g

+

1

2z d4xd4yh(x), (x  y)h(y),

 (x  y)c(y)

(a1)

where  denotes the tadpole. j  (x) represents the
source term for the brs transformation of the gravi-
ton eld and c(y) is the vector ghost eld. the tensor
g
 (xy), which is given to lowest order by equation (3),
can be expressed diagrammatically in a loop expansion,
as shown in references [11,13,14].

the relevant brs invariance for the thermal graviton

self-energy can now be written as

z d4x





h (x)

j  (x)

= 0.

(a2)

2

dierentiating (a2) with respect to c(y) and setting all
elds and source to zero, yields in momentum space the
following condition for the tadpole

which are traceless and transverse with respect to k and
u. these tensors are actually eigentensors of 
 with
the same eigenvalue

 g

 (k = 0)(cid:12)(cid:12)h=0

= 0.

(a3)

on the other hand, dierentiating (a2) with respect to
c(y) and h(z), and setting the source to zero, leads
at h = 0 to the identity

,  (k)g

 (k) +  g, 



(k) = 0,

(a4)



denotes the derivative of g

where g, 
 with respect
to h. if we consider the tadpoles only for the purpose
of calculating the leading contributions to the self-energy,
eq. (a4) can be written at h = 0 as follows:

(cid:2), (k)g



 (k)(cid:3)(l)
(cid:2),  (k)g

= g, 
 (k)(cid:3)(s)

= 0.

(k),

(a5)

(a6)

eq. (a6) is equivalent to (8), since g
 (k) does not con-
tain leading thermal contributions. the above relations
have been veried explicitly in [11], to one loop order. in
this case, for example, eq. (a6) becomes (at h = 0)

(s) ,  (k)g(0) 



(k) + k (0) ,  (k)g(1) 



(k) = 0.

(a7)

an important consequence of (a7), which follows from
the fact that k (0)
(7) is transverse with
respect to k, is the identity

,  (k) in eq.

kk(s), (k) = 0.

(a8)

this is analogous to the identity kk  (k) = 0, which
holds in qcd for the exact gluon self-energy.

and



in this appendix, we will derive the non-linear relations
involving the elements of (s)

quence of the vanishing of its determinant.
(in what
follows, for simplicity of notation, we shall drop the su-
perscripts (s).) to this end, it is convenient to introduce
a set of 10 polarization tensors l
 (l = 1,    , 10), which
constitute a basis for the eigentensors of 
. two of
these tensors describe the physical graviton eld, which
has spin 2 and helicities 2. in terms of the transverse
vectors e1,2

(b10)

in order to obtain non-trivial eigentensors of 
 from
the above set of equations, we must impose the condition
that the determinant involving the corresponding eigen-
values must vanish. this leads to a quadratic equation
which determines a set of two eigenvalues. (because of
the form of eqs. (b9) and (b10) the other two eigenval-
ues will be degenerate with those in the rst set.) the
product of the eigenvalues must therefore vanish, yield-
ing in this way the non-linear relation given by eq. (9).
the system (b9) and (b10) determines altogether four
eigentensors of 
, two of which have zero eigenvalues.
taking into account eq. (b2), we have thus far a total
of six eigentensors of 
, so that we must still nd four
more eigentensors. these must be each linear combina-
tions of the tensors l
 (l = 7    10). the requirement
of non-trivial eigentensors leads to a quartic equation for
the remaining four eigenvalues, which can be written in
the form of a vanishing determinant

where r  k2/(k  u)2.
as a consequence of the brs condition given by (8),
we must have a total of four eigentensors with zero eigen-
values. since (b9) and (b10) have already determined
two such eigentensors, it follows that (b11) must have
two vanishing roots. this yields two more non-linear
relations among the structure functions, which can be
written symbolically in the form

k4 (l11 + l22) = k2l  l + l  l  l,

(b16)

and
k4 (l11l22  l12l21) = k2l  l  l + l  l  l  l,

where l denotes some matrix element of (b11).
