vital ingredient quest unied theory embracing physical phenomena supersymmetry, symmetry (a) unites bosons fermions, (b) requires exis- tence gravity (c) places upper limit eleven dimension spacetime. reasons, early 1980s many physicists looked eleven-dimensional supergravity hope might provide elusive superunied theory. 1984 superuni- cation underwent major paradigm-shift: eleven-dimensional supergravity knocked pedestal ten-dimensional superstrings , one-dimensional objects whose vibrational modes represent elementary particles. unlike eleven-dimensional supergravity, super- strings provided perturbatively nite theory gravity which, compactication four spacetime dimensions, seemed principle capable explaining standard model strong, weak electromagnetic forces including required chiral representations quarks leptons. despite major successes, however, nagging doubts persisted superstrings. first, many important questions string theory strings break supersymmetry? choose right vacuum state? explain smallness cosmological constant? resolve apparent paradoxes quantum black holes? seemed incapable answered within framework weak coupling perturbation expansion. seemed call new, non-perturbative, physics. secondly, appear dierent mathematically consistent superstring theories: e8 e8 heterotic string, so(32) heterotic string, so(32) type string, type iia type iib strings? one
