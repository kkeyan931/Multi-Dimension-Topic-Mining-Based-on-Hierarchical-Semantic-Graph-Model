starting with the curvature 2-form a recursive construction of totally antisym-
metrised 2p-forms is introduced, to which we refer as p-riemann tensors. contrac-
tion of indices permits a corresponding generalisation of the ricci tensor. static,
spherically symmetric p-ricci at schwarzschild like metrics are constructed in
this context for d > 2p + 1, d being the spacetime dimension. the existence of de
sitter type solutions is pointed out. our 2p-forms vanish for d < 2p and the limiting
cases d = 2p and d = 2p + 1 exhibit special features which are discussed briey. it is
shown that for d = 4p our class of solutions correspond to double-selfdual riemann
2p-form (or p-riemann tensor). topological aspects of such generalised gravitational
instantons and those of associated (through spin connections) generalised yang-mills
instantons are briey mentioned. the possibility of a study of surface deformations
at the horizons of our class of p-black holes leading to virasoro algebras with a
p-dependent hierarchy of central charges is commented on. remarks in conclusion
indicate directions for further study and situate our formalism in a broader context.

i. introduction

the basic aim of this work is to present schwarzschild like solutions to a hierarchy of gravitational
systems that we studied sometime ago [1,2], which generalise the einstein-hilbert system in a very
natural way. in this framework the lagrangian is higher order in the riemann tensor, but in such
a way that only the quadratic power of the velocity elds (namely derivatives of the metric or the
vielbein) appears in it. this formalism opens up broader possibilities of constructing gravitational
instantons in suitable higher dimensions. here we present another remarkable aspect, which is one
more evidence of the aptitude of our generalisation. the spherically symmetric, static black hole (or
the schwarzschild metric) which is unique in the einstein-hilbert framework, is the rst member of
a hierarchy in our context. de sitter type soluions also exist, rather systematically.

in the following sections we will deal with totally antisymmetrised 2p-forms constructed from
the riemann tensor, to which we refer as riemann 2p-forms or p-riemann tensors. the explicit
recursive prescription is given below. throughout we will consider spacetimes of arbitrary dimension
d, with (d  1) spatial dimensions. our 2p-forms vanish for d < 2p and the dynamics leads to very
special, degenerate cases for d = 2p and d = 2p + 1. the generic situation arises for d > 2p + 1,
(p = 1, 2, 3, ...).

contracting indices of the riemann 2p-forms one obtains the standard ricci tensor for p = 1 and a
generalised hierarchy of p-ricci tensors to be dened below. we show that for spherical symmetry
one obtains as p-ricci at solutions a remarkable hierarchy of p-black holes, generalising the
schwarzschild metric in d dimensions as follows

ds2 = n(p)dt2 + n 1

(p) dr2 + r2d2

(d2) ,

with

n(p) = 1 

2c

d2p1

p

r

,

(1.1)

(d2) being the line element on the unit (d 2)-sphere. for p = 1 one recovers the standard lapse

d2
function in d dimensions [3],

n(1)  n = 1 

2c
rd3

.

(1.2)

the derivation of the solution (1.1) and the study of various aspects of interest will be given below.
let us present the construction of the p-ricci tensors. a detailed account can be found in [2]
where many sources are cited. we present here the essential steps using throughout dierential
forms in the frame-vector (vielbein) basis which will be most useful for our purposes.

in the following sections we will be concerned with a particular, simple, class of metrics. generally,

for some metric, a suitable set of tangent frame vectors are the 1-forms

where as usual a, b, ... denote frame indices and , , ... space-time ones.

the torsionless antisymmetric spin-connection 1-forms

ea = ea

 dx ,

satisfy

ab = ab

 dx = ba

dea + ab  eb = 0.

the curvature tensor is now given by the antisymmetric 2-form

rab = dab + a

c  cb = rba ,

2

(1.3)

(1.4)

which can be expressed in the e-basis as

rab = rab

ab ea

 eb

.

(1.5)

(1.5) is the riemann 2-form corresponding to p = 1. now we introduce the following recursive

construction of totally antisymmetric riemann 2p-forms.

for p = 2 we dene

rabcd = rab  rcd + rad  rbc + rac  rdb ,

(1.6)

having cyclically permuted (b, c, d). using the antisymmetry of rab and, the fact that rab  rcd =
rcd  rab since 2-forms commute, one readily veries that rabcd is totally antisymmetric.

for p = 3 we dene

rabcdef = rab  rcdef + raf  rbcde + rae  rf bcd + rad  ref bc + rac  rdef b

(1.7)

having cyclically permuted (b, c, d, e, f ). there are 15 terms of the type rab  rcd  ref in (1.7) and
again it can be checked readily that rabcdef is totally antisymmetric.

the general recursion scheme is

ra1a2...a2p = ra1a2  ra3a4...a2p + cyclic permutations of (a2, a3, ..., a2p) ,

(1.8)

which consists of 3.5...(2p 3)(2p 1) terms of the type ra1a2  ra3a4  ... ra2p1a2p, and is totally
antisymmetric. in the e-basis

ra1a2...a2p = ra1a2...a2p
b1b2...b2p

eb1  eb2 ...  eb2p .

for p = 1 the ricci tensor is given by

r(1)

a

b = xc

rac

bc = ra
b .

we dene the p-ricci tensor to be

r(p)

a1
b1

=

1

(2p  1)! x(a2,...,a2p)

ra1a2...a2p
b1a2...a2p

,

such that the p-ricci scalar pertaining to it is

r(p) = xa

r(p)

a
a

.

(1.9)

(1.10)

(1.11)

(1.12)

the overall constant (2p  1)! in (1.11) takes acount of the number of permutaions of the indices
summed over subject to the total antisymmetry of both upper and lower indices. this normalisation
factor, though convenient, is however not essential for our purposes.

the corresponding generalisations of the einstein-hilbert lagrangian and the einstein tensor are
given in [2]. but, apart from pointing out in passing how de sitter type solutions arise very simply
and evidently, our concern here will be limited to p-ricci at solutions.

in the absence of matter and cosmological constant the lagrangian is p|g|r(p) and the variational

minima are obtained (in the e-basis) [2] from

r(p)

a

b 

1
2p

ga
b r(p) = 0.

for the p-ricci at case, consistently with r(p) = 0, the solutions satisfy

r(p)

a

b = 0 .

(1.13)

(1.14)

one computes (1.11) for a given metric introduced as an ansatz and involving one (or possibly more)
unknown function(s) to be consistently determined to satisfy the constraints (1.14).

in this paper we study the spherically symmetric solutions, in which case it is natural to start

(since we have the hierarchy (1.1) in mind) with

ds2 = n dt2 + n 1dr2 + r2d2

(d2) ,

(1.15)

and see if one can obtain an n satisfying all the constraints (1.14). in the event, we will start with
the kerr-schild (k-s) form of the metric given by

g =  + 2cll
g =   2cll

where 00 = 1, ij = ij, (i=1,2,...,d-1), and

ll =  ll = gll = 0 .

for black hole type solutions with a horizon, one assumes c > 0.

for spherical symmetry one may set

li = l0

xi
r

= lo xi ,

with r = p|xi|2 and |xi|2 = 1.

now (1.15) and (1.16) are related through

x0 = t +z dr

n  r ,

l  l2

0 =

1
2c

(1  n ) .

(1.16)

(1.17)

(1.18)

(1.19)

the k-s form is non-diagonal and thus loses some simple properties of (1.15). but we consider

its introduction worthwhile for the following two reasons.

 in (1.15) there are two distinguished coordinates (t, r) while in (1.16) there is only one, x0, all
the space-coordinates being treated on the same footing. as will be shown below, this leads
to a smaller number of groups of terms to be summed over. (in fact, for spherical coordinates
each angular one, i, also contributes dierently through sin i to the line element. but, as
will be seen, this feature gets absorbed in the e-basis for rab.)

 the second, and more important reason is, that the k-s form is more ecient for generalisation
to axial symmetry [3,4].
in exploring such possibilities, faced with the complexities of the
combinatorics ivolved, it would be helpful to to have ready the results of the spherically
symmetric limit to fall back on as checks.

the second of these points concerns however a future project. as will be seen in the following

sections we will also fully exploit the special advantages of (1.15).

ii. construction of p -ricci tensors for spherical symmetry and

solutions

for the k-s metric (1.16) the frame vectors are

and ea = ea

dx with ea = abeb.

the spin-connections are

ea
 = a
e
a = 

 + c lla
a  c lla ,

(2.1)

ab
 = b ea

  a eb



and ab = ab

 dx = ba.

since (1.18) holds for spherical symmetry it is convenient to introduce the notations

giving

dr = xidxi ,

er = xiei ,

e0 = dx0  c l (dx0 + dr)
ei = dxi + c l xi (dx0 + dr)
er = dr + c l (dx0 + dr)

in which l = l2
o.

using now (1.4) and (2.2) one obtains, after straightforward simplications,

r0i = a e0  ei + b xi e0  er
rij = f ei  ej + h er  (xj ei  xiej)

where, with l = dl
dr

and l = d2

b = c(l

h = c(

r
l
) = (f  a).
r

note that the de sitter solution in d dimensions is obtained by setting

l = r2 ,

a = f = 2c ,

b = h = 0 ,

yielding

for higher p members of the hierarchy, one continues to obtain, starting with p = 2,

rab = 2c ea  eb .

rabcd = 3(2c)2ea  eb  ec  ed

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

and the situation does not change essentially as p increases, giving at each stage a constant r(p).
having pointed this out, we consider henceforth only p-at solutions without cosmological constant.

as a check one may verify, to start with, that for

one indeed obtains the schwarzschild solutions in d dimensions [3] satisfying

l = r(d3)

r(1)

b  ra

b = rac

bc = 0.

(2.10)

this will of course also emerge as the simplest particular (p = 1) case of our general solution given
below. it is very instructive to study in detail the cases p = 2 and 3. for low values of d one can
even write all terms in the summations explicitly. the general structure is seen to emerge more
clearly at each successive stage. for brevity however, we present directly the general case. from
(1.8) and (2.5) one obtains the following results.

no summations are involved in the following particular cases of

r(p)

(2p  1)! xi1,...,i2p1

r

0i1...i2p1
ii1...i2p1 = 0 .

similarly, from (2.12)

concerning the other cases it is helpful to note the following points,

r(p)

i

0 = 0 .

xi1,...,i2p1

(x2

i1 + ... + x2

2p  2 (cid:19)
i2p1 ) = (cid:18) d  2

and

xi2,...,i2p1

(x2

i2 + ... + x2

i2p1 ) = (cid:18) d  3

2p  3 (cid:19) (1  x2

i1 ) ,

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

where we have used the usual notation

b (cid:19) =
(cid:18) a

a!

b! (a  b)!

.

for (2.19) one notes that in summing over the (2p  1)-tuples, each xi occurs as many times as
the possibility of selecting (2p 2)-tuples (of distinct xj s) among the coordinates after xing 0 and
i, namely among (d  2). then one uses

d1

xi=1

x2
i = 1 .

for (2.20) one uses analogous arguments, and

xj6=i

j = 1  x2
x2
i .

we use such results and consider the normalisation factor in (1.11) to be absorbed implicitly
by exhibiting only contributions of distinct numbers of combinations, as in (2.19) and (2.20). for
convenience we also introduce the notations

x  lp2(cid:2)p(rll) + (d  2p  1)l2(cid:3)
y  lp2(cid:2)r2(ll + (p  1)l2) + (d  2p)(rll)(cid:3) .

(2.21)

using all these results, combining terms and simplifying, completing the necessary summations

and using (2.5), one obtains nally,

r(p)

0

0 = (1.3.5...(2p  3))f p2(cid:20)(2p  1)af (cid:18) d  1

from (2.17), (2.18), (2.22), (2.23) and (2.24) we see that for all (a, b),

provided that

r(p)

a

b = 0

x = lp2(cid:2)p(rll) + (d  2p  1)l2(cid:3) = 0
y = lp2(cid:2)r2(ll + (p  1)l2) + (d  2p)(rll)(cid:3) = 0 .

(2.25)

since a constant factor of l can be absorbed in c, the single necessary and sucient constraint
satisfying (2.25), and hence the variational equations (2.22)-(2.24), turns out to be

lp = r(d2p1) .

(2.26)

dierentiating (2.26) once yields

and dierentiating a second time,

x = 0

y = 0 .

for p = 1 this reduces to the standard schwarzschild metric in d dimensions [3] with

let us now indicate briey certain complementary features arising when one uses the diagonal

metric (1.15). now one has

l = l2

0 = r(d3) .

(2.27)

where

(2.28)

for a diagonal metric one can set (no summation being involved)

ea = gaadxa ,
ab =

(2.34)

the intermediate, suppressed, steps are straightforward.

consistently with our previous derivation, this expression vanishes for

n = n(2) = 1  2cl(2) = 1  2cr 1

one can verify that for the general case one indeed obtains

n(p) = 1  2cl(p) = 1  2cr d2p1

we will not rederive here this result. but important uses of the diagonal metric are presented in

the following sections.

iii. maximal extensions and p -dependent periodicity for euclidean

signature

the limiting cases

d = 2p

and

d = 2p + 1

will be briey discussed in the following section. for

d > 2p + 1

one has a schwarzschild like event horizon in

ds2 = n(p)dt2 + n 1

one can introduce kruskal type coordinates, generalised for p > 1, to desingularise the horizon.
we will be particularly interested in the euclidean section and the p-dependence of the time-period
which becomes necessary for consistency. for the standard case (d=4, p = 1) this period is well
known to be inversely proportional to the hawking temperature of the black hole. here we generalise
the treatment (for d  4 , p = 1) presented in [5]. for d = 4 a detailed study citing basic sources is
to be found in [6].

we start directly with the euclidean continuation of (3.1),

ds2 = n(p)dt2 + n 1

one obtains the required desingularisation at the horizon as a direct generalisation of the standard
case for p = 1, namely of

2k (cid:19) .

(3.12)

it should be noted that for lorentz signature there is already an essential singularity at r = 0
and for euclidean signature the domain of real values of (, ) corresponds to r  k. hence in both
cases a fractional power of r in n(p) does not introduce a crucial supplementary complication. one
may also note that though the power of r in n(p) is in general fractional, for any p and d satisfying

d = (n + 2)p + 1 ,

n = 1, 2, 3, ...

it becomes an integer. examples of such integers for p > 1 are

(d , p ; n) = (10 , 3 ; 1), (11 , 2 ; 3), ...

from (3.4) and (3.11) one obtains for t a period

p(p) =

d > 2p + 1 .

(3.13)

for d = 4, p = 1, k = 2m one gets back to the well-known result for the schwarzschild metric

p  p(1) = 8m .

for elds on the euclidean section, periods and temperatures are related inversely through the
boltzmann constant. here one sees that, for given d, p(p) increases and hence the temperature
decreases as p becomes larger.

we briey indicate certain features of the special cases d = 2p, d = 2p + 1, and d = 4p.

iv. special cases

10

a. d = 2p

it is easily veried that when d = 2p the lagrangian r(p) is a total divergence and hence can
possess topological rather than dynamical properties. in fact one obtains the euler number which,
if our solution is implemented, is constrained to be zero  a new possibility arising for p > 1. here
we express the single surviving 2p-form in terms of total dierentials and note the relation with our
general solution.

the simplest example is provided by

from (2.32) and (1.6)

d = 4 ,

, p = 2 .

rtr12 = rtr  r12 + rt2  rr1 + rt1  r2r

=

4r2 (cid:2)(1  n )n  + (n )2(cid:3) et  er  e1  e2 .

in conventional notations, 1 = , 2 =

(4.2)

d = 2p ,

p = 1, 2, 3, ...

the angular factors can again be expressed as total dierentials in an evident fashion while, crucially,
the coecient of dr can be shown to become

d2
dr2 (lp).

(4.3)

the computation is straightforward but will not be presented here. we just note that this coecient
vanishes for

lp = c1 + c2r

with c1 and c2 constants. our generic solution

lp = r(d2p1) = r

for d = 2p is included in (4.4) for c1=0 and c2 = 1, giving

for d = 4 this gives

n(p) = 1  2cr

p = 1  2cr

n(2) = 1  2cr

2 .

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

in section iii we generalised kruskal coordinates to negative fractional power of r in n(p). let
us just mention that one can formally generalise gibbons-hawking coordinates [6,7] for such a
cosmological horizon involving a fractional power 1
p .

flat space is of course, as always, a solution (c1 = c2 = 0). but for c2 = 0 one obtains a constant

lp. this situation is discussed below since it arises generically for d = 2p + 1.

11

b. d = 2p + 1

in this case our generic solution itself gives

lp = r(d2p1) = 1 .

this corresponds to the situation where the l2 term is absent in x given by (2.21).

for 2c < 1, now

and one has still lorentz signature with

n = 1  2c = 2 < 1

ds2 = 2dt2 + 2dr2 + r2d2

(d2) .

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

setting r =  one can obtain an isotropic form. we do not propose to discuss further here this
degenerate case. of much more interest is the following one.

c. d = 4p : double selfduality

the general formulation of double selfduality and the generalised yang-mills instantons con-
structed, for euclidean signature, in terms of the spin-connections was the major theme in [2]. for
d = 8, de sitter and fubini-study metrics were obtained by the present authors, imposing dou-
ble selfduality [1]. here we will verify that our schwarzschild type (p-schwarzschild) solutions also
satisfy double selfduality for d = 4p.

to start with we note that (2.32) along with (1.8) ensures rhat ra1a2...a2p has only one non-zero

component

this diagonalisation simplies dramatically the situation. in the general formulation, in frame
indices, the double self-duality constraint

ra1a2...a2p

a1a2...a2p .

ra1a2...a2p
b1b2...b2p

=

1

(2p!)2

a1a2...a2pd1d2...d2pb1b2...b2pc1c2...c2prc1c2...c2p
d1d2...d2p

reduces to

ra1a2...a2p

a1a2...a2p = ra2p+1a2p+2...a4p
a2p+1a2p+2...a4p

for all choices of complementary sets of the 4p indices.

for d = 4, p = 1

1  n =

2c
r

(4.10)

(4.11)

and the well-known double selfduality of the schwarzschild metric is assured through the relations

since from (2.32)

n  =

2c
r3 =

1
r2 (1  n )

rtr
tr =

n  ,

r12

12 =

r2 (1  n ) .

even more directly one has

rt2

t2 = rr1

each one being just

.

thus one has a gravitational instanton on the euclidean section with nontrivial topological indices
(euler number and hirzbruch signature). the spin-connections lead to a selfdual yang-mills eld [8].
it is a general fact that such a construction provides a solution for the combined gravitational-ym
system. this is because the metric is not aected by a back-reaction of the ym eld, since the
stress energy-momentum tensor of the selfdual ym eld vanishes.

for d = 8 , , p = 2, we have

1  n = 2c r 1
this assures in the crucial equality between

2 (841) = 2c r 3

2 .

and

r3456

3456 = 3(cid:18) 1

r2 (1  n )(cid:19)2

and hence the double selfduality constraint

rtr12

tr12 = r3456
3456 .

(4.16)

here, as before, the indices 1, 2, ..., 6 refer to 1, 2, ..., 6 respectively. other constraints due to (4.11)
can als be shown to be satised systematically.

for the general case with d = 4p

1  n = 2c r d2p1

p = 2c r 2p1

p

.

this satises the crucial relation

(cid:18)

2

n (cid:19)(cid:18) 1

r2 (1  n )(cid:19) + (2p  2)(cid:18)

n 

2r (cid:19)2

= (2p  1)(cid:18) 1

r2 (1  n )(cid:19)2

,

which assures the double selfduality constraint

tr12...(2p2) = r(2p1)(2p)...(4p2)
rtr12...(2p2)
(2p1)(2p)...(4p2) .

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

other constraints due to (4.11) can als be shown to be satised systematically.

a systematic study of the topological properties of this class of gravitational instantons and those
of the associated ym ones (both for the general p case in the sense of [2]) will be presented elsewhere.

v. a comment on surface deformations and near-horizon symmetry

a number of recent papers explore gauge algebra of surface deformations restricted to event
or cosmological horizons [9,10]. the references [9,10] deal with any dimension d , but of course
for p = 1. other important sources, mostly concerning specic low dimensions, are cited in these
papers. from both types of horizons, the (r, t) plane playing a crucial role, a virasoro subalgebra
emerges from the study of surface deformations with a central charge

13

c =

3a
2gt

(5.1)

where a is the area of the horizon, (8g)1 is the overall factor of the boundary terms in the full
generator of surface deformations, t is the period of rotational perturbations considered and lastly 
is obtained as a coecient on developing the lapse function n near the horizon. for a schwarzschid
black-hole, for example,  turns out to be the inverse of the hawking temperature [9].

for our case, starting with (3.1), i.e.

r (cid:19)
n(p) = 1 (cid:18) k

d2p1

p

hence

when

dn(p)

dr |r=k = (cid:18) d  2p  1

pk

(cid:19) 

2
(p)

(p) =

(2k) p
d  2p  1

.

(5.2)

this is, of course, directly proportional to the period p(p) derived before (see (3.13)) and gives for

the schwarzschild case with

d = 4 , p = 1 , k = 2m ,

we do not intend to undertake a study of surface deformations for our horizons. we just point

out that, quite plausibly, a p-dependent hierarchy of central charges will emerge in our context.

 = 4m .

(5.3)

vi. general remarks

to construct our metrics as variational minima of the traces of higher order terms, we have
gone beyond einsten theory generalised to higher dimensions. higher order gravitational terms are
nowadays familiar (the so called (r2)2 and r4 terms) in string theory eective actions [11,12]. but we
consider separately the members of one particular hierarchy of higher order terms, that in which only
velocity-square terms appear, generalising the einsten-hilbert term directly, and not perturbative
contributions, starting with the standard formalism.
in certain constructions of topological eld
theories [14] higher order terms are introduced directly at the start. one may keep such aspects in
mind. but the real motivation for presenting our formal structure is the discovery of the remarkable
class of solutions with their simple, suggestive and beautiful properties discussed above. thus, for
example, rich topological possibilities involving generalised gravitational and ym instantons enter
in the wake of our solutions merely as a particular case (d = 4p). more generally, topological aspects
in higher dimensions [14,15] deserve study specically in the context of our formulation.

an adequate formulation of surface deformation algebras, alluded to in sec. v, might be of
interest. we intend to explore elsewhere possibilities of axially symmetric, stationary solutions in
our context. all these aspects along with a deeper understanding of the role of higher order forms
provide an interesting program.
