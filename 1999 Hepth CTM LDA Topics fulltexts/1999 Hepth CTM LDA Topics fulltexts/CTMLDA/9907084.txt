(3.7) rw picture, easy see triangles lie immediately right ascending step, followed triangle next step also ascending. words, pairs up-down triangles correspond exactly pairs made two successive ascending steps. denoting n++ (resp. n+, n+, n) pairs successive ascending-ascending (resp. ascending-descending, descending-ascending, descending-descending) steps, relations n+ = n+, p = n++, = n++ n, = n++ + n+ + n+ + n . (3.8) rst relation simply states many summits valleys rw landscape. thanks relations eq. (3.1), rewrite (3.7) gs(l1+l21)an+++n++n++n+t(l1+l21) an+++n+t = gs 1 (ga)l1+l21 an++n+ . (3.9) introduction 6= 1 thus two eects rw weight: (i) changes interaction contact walls (1/g) (1/ga) (ii) introduces factor change slope walk. note two eects cancel exactly walls net contribution simply factor change slope inside strip. weight nothing extrinsic curvature energy e ln(a) one dimensional random walk. thus remarkable intrinsic curvature weight two-dimensional lorentzian gravity translates extrinsic one-dimensional curvature weight equivalent random walk problem. note according whether less larger 30 one, one positive (favoring straight lines) negative (favoring u-turns) curvature elastic constant. well known extrinsic curvature irrelevant perturbation large scale properties random walk. introduces nite correlation length random walk rigid (positive curvature) crumpled (negative curvature) scales larger correlation length, curvature plays role. appropriate rescaling, one thus recovers asymptotically continuum limit without curvature energy. precisely observed (2.32). 3.4. product two transfer matrices rw picture lorentzian triangulations, easily re-derive relation (2.23) product two transfer matrices. indeed, two-matrix product element like i,j corresponds sum appropriate weights lorentzian triangulations made exactly two time slices, xed number triangles lower slice, xed number j triangles upper slice, staircase boundary conditions. rw representation, thus consider random walks strip height three 0 h 3, starting h = 0, ending h = 3 exactly contacts h = 0 j contacts h = 3. thus sum rw xed number contacts top bottom strip 0 h 3. decompose random walk + j 1 blocks corresponding + j 1 portions walk two successive contacts (see fig.10). blocks four types, numbered (1) (4), according whether contacts bottom top strip, namely (see fig.10): (1) bottom-bottom, (2) top- top, (3) bottom-top, (4) top-bottom. blocks dier (up down) nature rst last steps intermediate steps form saw-tooth sequence h = , , , , , , , = 1 1, arbitrary (possibly zero) length k. desired sum random walks achieved rst choosing one (cid:0)i+j2 i1 (cid:1) allowed sequences bottom top contacts, summing random walks particular sequence contacts, nally summing sequences. alternatively, attach directly global weight individually four block types summing possible intermediate congurations, i.e. values lengths k. interested matrix-product (g, a)t (g, a), must attach weight ga ascending step slice 0 h 1, weight ga ascending step 31 (1) (3) (2) (4) fig. 10: decomposition walk height + 1 = 3 blocks. block portion walk two successive contacts walls h = h = 3. blocs four types according four possibilities (1) bottom-bottom, (2) top-top, (3) bottom-top (4) top-bottom two contacts extremities. slice 2 h 3 weight (ggaa) ascending step slice 1 h 2. must correct weight curvature factor 1/a2 sequence h = 0, 1, 2 factor 1/a2 sequence h = 1, 2, 3. gathering factors summing k, obtain block weights: w(1) 2 = ga + ga a2 (ggaa)k = w(2) 2 = ga + (ggaa)k = ga + g2(1 a2)ga , 1 ggaa ga + g2(1 a2)ga 1 ggaa ga a2 xk=1 xk=1 xk=1 (ggaa)k = g2g2 1 ggaa , (ga)(ga) a2a2 w(3) 2 = w(4) 2 = xk=0 (ggaa)k = 1 1 ggaa . , (3.10) note weights gathered inside blocks consecutive blocks interact. order commutation (g, a)t (g, a) = (g, a)t (g, a), sucient four weights invariant change (g, a) (g, a). 32 readily case weights w(3) commutation condition reads therefore: 2 w(4) 2 , w(1) 2 w(2) 2 exchanged. w(1) 2 = w(2) 2 1 g2(1 a2) ga = 1 g2(1 a2) ga q + 1 q , (3.11) dening two couples (g, a) (g, a) common value q (2.5). go show (2.23), must compare product (g, a)t (g, a) single matrix say (g, a). let us note block decomposition achieved random walks strip height two, describing one-slice triangulations contributing elements single matrix (g, a). case, contact sequence fully species random walk four block types correspond four possible two step sequences: (1) h = +1, 1, (2) h = 1, +1, (3) h = +1, +1 (4)h = 1, 1. leads immediately following block weights: 1 = ga, w(1) 1 = w(2) w(3) 1 = g2, w(4) 1 = 1.

(3.14) using commutation relation (3.11) fact n(3) = n(4) + 1, i.e. number ascending blocks one unit number descending blocks random walks consider, rewrite (3.13) as: 1 2 (cid:16)w(1) 2 (cid:17)n(1)+n(2) ggw(4) 2 w(4) (cid:16)w(3) 2 (cid:17)n(3) . (3.15) 33 get therefore obtain product relation: (g, a)t (g, a) = g ggw(4) 2 (g, a), (3.16) provided (i) commutation relation (3.11) satised (ii) relation: w(1) 2 = w(1) 1 g = = w(3) 2 w(4) 2 = w(3) 1 gg 1 ggaa ga + ga ggaa(cid:18)q + 1 q(cid:19) (3.17) gg q (3.11) above. straightforward check values g obey relation: 1 g2(1 a2) ga = q + 1 q , (3.18) thus three couples (g, a),(g, a) (g, a) correspond value q. introduce parameter (2.19) (g, a) (g, a), value (g, a) found = , pre-factor (3.16) disappears since g/ggw(4) 2 = 1. therefore proven relation (2.23) language random walks. one note power method comes fact used four basic objects, four blocks, corresponds particularly simple family walks, arbitrary sequence blocks plays role. expect take advantage block decomposition obtain commutation relations transfer matrices involved problems lorentzian gravity, particular including matter degrees freedom. 4. models 4.1. general construction: symmetric case let us reconsider expression (2.18) curvature transfer matrix tq() terms generating functions fm eigenvectors. start arbitrary orthonormal family v(m), = 1, 2, ... vectors generating space e, given non-zero function f (), may easily construct commuting set symmetric transfer matrices () entries ti,j() = f () xm1 v(m) m1v(m) j , 34 (4.1) satisfy multiplicativity property ()t () = f ()f () f () ().
