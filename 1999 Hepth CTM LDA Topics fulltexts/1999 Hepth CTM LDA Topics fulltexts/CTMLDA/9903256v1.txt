remarks on the atiyah - hitchin metric

department of physics, university of patras,

gr-26500 patras, greece

abstract

we outline the construction of the atiyah-hitchin metric on the moduli space of

su (2) bps monopoles with charge 2, rst as an algebraic curve in c 3 following

donaldson and then as a solution of the toda eld equations in the continual large

n limit. we adopt twistor methods to solve the underlying uniformization problem,

which by the generalized legendre transformation yield the kahler coordinates and

the kahler potential of the metric. we also comment on the connection between

twistors and the seiberg-witten construction of quantum moduli spaces, as they

arise in three dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories, and briey address the

uniformization of algebraic curves in c 3 in the context of large n toda theory.

 based on talks delivered in september 1998 at the 32nd international symposium ahrenshoop

on the theory of elementary particles, buckow; the 21st triangular meeting on quantum field

theory, crete and the tmr meeting on quantum aspects of gauge theories, supersymmetry

and unication, corfu; to be published in the proceedings in fortschritte der physik.

2

the atiyah-hitchin space is a four-dimensional hyper-kahler manifold with so(3)

isometry that was introduced long time ago to describe the moduli space of su(2) bps

monopoles of magnetic charge 2 [1, 2]. in more recent years, this space and various gen-

eralizations thereof were identied with the full quantum moduli space of n = 4 super-

symmetric gauge theories in three dimensions [3]. the purpose of this contribution is

to summarize briey various results scattered in the literature on the algebro-geometric

properties of the atiyah-hitchin space, with emphasis on the explicit description of its

kahler structure, and make connections between them by interpreting the classical twistor

construction of hyper-kahler manifolds (and the associated spectral curve) essentially as

seiberg-witten construction of the geometry of non-perturbative quantum moduli spaces.

the technical ingredient is the non-triholomorphic nature of the killing vector elds that

generate the full isometry group of the atiyah-hitchin space. in the two approaches that

will be outlined in the sequel one chooses an abelian subgroup so(2)  so(3) to construct
the kahler coordinates of the metric and derive all the relevant information about it in

terms of elliptic integrals. one approach is donaldsons description of the moduli space

as an algebraic curve in c 3, the other is based on the continual toda eld equation that

arises in the large n limit of 2-dim conformal eld theories. we nd as byproduct that

su() toda theory arises in the uniformization of algebraic curves in c 3, whereas su(2)
toda theory (ie liouvilles equation) arises in the uniformization of algebraic curves in c 2

(ie riemann surfaces), as it is well known for more than a century. this aspect certainly

deserves further study and we hope to return to it elsewhere together with the possible use

of twistor techniques in future developments of non-perurbative strings via m-theory [4],

where the seiberg-witten curve has a pivotal role, or f-theory [5].

recall donaldsons description of the moduli space of monopoles as the space of rational

functions of a complex variable, say w , of degree 2 given in normal form as

f (w ) =

a1w + a0
w 2  b0

;

a0

2  b0a1

2 6= 0,

(1)

3

modulo the equivalence f (w )  f (w ) for   c  [6]. here a0, a1, b0 are complex
numbers (moduli). setting the resultant of these maps equal to 1, we obtain an algebraic

curve in c 3,

a0

2  b0a1

2 = 1,

(2)

which describes the (universal) double covering of the atiyah-hitchin space; alternatively,

the atiyah-hitchin space is the quotient of the algebraic curve (2) by the involution z2 :

(a0, a1, b0)  (a0, a1, b0). donaldsons parametrization of the moduli space involves
choosing a preferred direction in r3 (the space where bps monopoles actually live) and

the variable w in f (w ) above parametrizes the 2-plane orthogonal to that direction.

this description does not respect the full rotational symmetry of r3, so(3), which is

the complete isometry group of atiyah-hitchin space, as it amounts to choosing an abelian

subgroup so(2)  so(3); it selects a preferred complex structure out of the three available
in hyper-kahler geometry, and as such it is more appropriate for comparison with the toda

eld theory description of the metric, where, as we will see later, one chooses adapted

coordinates to a non-triholomorphic so(2) isometry.

next, we consider the uniformization of the curve a0

2  b0a1

2 = 1, which is only briey

discussed in [2]. for this we start rst with the elliptic curve

2() = k 2(k)(cid:16)kk 2  3(k2

 k2)  kk(cid:17) ,

(3)

which can be brought into weierstrass form y2 = 4x3  g2x  g3 using the change of
2 = kkk 2(k), k2 = (k2  k2)/3kk. the quantity
variables  = k1y,  = x + k2, where 4k1
1 = 4k1 is the real period of the curve, whereas its period matrix 1/2 turns out to be

 = ik(k)/k(k). for generic values of k the roots in weierstrass form are all distinct and

they are ordered increasingly on the real axis as e3 < e2 < e1 with branch cuts running

from e3 to e2 and e1 to . as k  1 we have e2  e1 in which case the b-cycle of the
underlying riemann surface degenerates and this corresponds to the taub-nut limit of

4

the atiyah-hitchin space. on the other hand, as k  0 we have e2  e3 in which case the
a-cycle of the riemann surface degenerates and this corresponds to a bolt structure in the

metric, where the 3-dim orbits of the full isometry group so(3) collapse to a two-sphere

(more precisely rp2  s 2/z2, since the rst homotopy group of the moduli space is z2).
these two limits are related by the modular transformation k  k that exchanges the a-
and b-cycles of the riemann surface.

next, it is convenient to roll up the curve (3) by applying an su(2) fractional trans-

formation

   =

c  d
d + c

,

   =



( d + c)2 ;

cc + d d = 1,

(4)

where the elements c, d of su(2) are parametrized using euler angles ,  and  as follows,

c = e

d = e

then the curve (3) becomes

2() = z + v  + w  2  v  3 + z  4,

where the coecients of the quartic polynomial turn out to be

(5)

(6)

z =

w =

k 2(k)e2isin2(cid:16)1 + k2sinh2(cid:17) , v = 
k 2(k)(cid:16)2  k 2 + 3sin2(cid:16)k2cos2  1(cid:17)(cid:17) ;

k 2(k)sin2ei(1 + k2costansinh)

i
2

where  = log tan



2! + i.

(7)

note that the  dependence of the coecients in (6) can be removed by appropriate rotation
of  and (), which is in turn consistent with the isometry so(2)  so(3) that was
selected having / as killing vector eld in terms of euler angles.

the uniformization proceeds by choosing a complex variable u so that

p(u) =

d
c  k2 

d
c

+ e2,

(8)

5

where p(u) denotes the weierstrass function of the cubic curve y2 = 4x3  g2x g3. then,
according to atiyah and hitchin [2], use of twistor methods lead to the following expressions

for b0, a0, a1,

1

qb0 =

c21p (u),
1
log(cid:18)a0 +qb0a1(cid:19) = 1(cid:18)(u) 
1
2  b0a1

u(cid:19) +

1
2

c d1p (u),

(9)

which together with the algebraic condition a0

2 = 1 complete the job. here, (u) is

the quasi-periodic -function in the theory of riemann surfaces,  (u) = p(u), with real
quasi-period 1, (u + 1) = (u) + 1 (not to be confused with the twistor curve variables

 and ()). the expression (9) can be written in more compact form using appropriate

contour integrals of the rotated spectral curve (6). first, by the dening properties of the

weierstrass p-function and the choice (8) of the uniformizing parameter u, we nd

b0 = 42( = 0)  4z.

(10)

second, following the changes of variables that transform the curve (3) from its weierstrass

form into the fully rotated spectral curve (6), we nd upon integration on an a-cycle,

log(cid:18)a0 +qb0a1(cid:19) =

1
2

( = 0)ia

d
 

.

(11)

note at this point that there are two discrete transformations whose eect is more easily

described in terms of the uniformizing parameter u,

i1 : u  u +

1
2

(1 + 2),

i2 : u  u +

1
2

2,

(12)

which fold pairwise the four weierstrass points onto each other. the latter are dened to

be the zeros of p (u) and they occur at u = 1/2 with p(u) = e1, u = (1 + 2)/2 with
p(u) = e2, u = 2/2 with p(u) = e3 and u = 0 with p(u) = . under the transformations
(12) the coecients z, v and w of the spectral curve (6) remain invariant; we also nd that
under each one of them b0 remains invariant. on the other hand, log(a0 + b0a1) gets

6

shifted by i by applying either i1 or i2, because 12  21 = 2i. therefore both i1 and
i2 correspond to the involution (a0, a1, b0)  (a0, a1, b0) and so the algebro-geometric
2 = 1, modulo the
description of the atiyah-hitchin space as a curve in c 3, a0

2  b0a1

involution (a0, a1, b0)  (a0, a1, b0), amounts to factoring out both of them.
language of euler angles, i1 exchanges the position of the two monopoles, thus treating

in the

them as identical particles, and results to a bolt structure s 2 as k  0 by restricting the
range of the angle  from 0 to 2 instead of 4, whereas i2, which is the discrete remnant

of an additional continuous triholomorphic isometry    + const. that only appears
asymptotically as k  1, is responsible for the bolt structure rp2  s 2/z2 that arises
upon factorization.

the second approach to the problem is based on toda eld theory which results by

selecting an abelian subgroup so(2) from the full isometry group so(3) of atiyah-hitchin

space and using adapted coordinates to this isometry. then, since all isometries are non-

triholomorphic, the hyper-kahler condition for the metric amounts to a non-linear dier-

ential equation in three dimensions for a single function , namely toda eld equation,

whose solution determines all components of the metric. more explicitly, consider kahler

coordinates q and p with respect to a selected complex structure and let k(q, q, p, p) be
the kahler potential that depends on them and their complex conjugates. by denition
of the kahler potential we have ds2 = 2k,qa qb dqad qb, where qa are q or p and the
hyper-kahler condition for the metric reads as k,q qk,p p k,q pk,p q = 1. for manifolds with
a non-triholomorphic isometry the kahler potential depends on the combination pp and not

on p and p separately, or to put it dierently there is a killing vector eld  = i(pp  p p)
with the property k = 0. then, introducing the notation pp  r, whereas p/p  exp(i)
denes the corresponding phase variable, we cast the hyper-kahler condition into the sim-

pler form

(rk,r),rk,q q  rk,rqk,r q = 1.

(13)

7

furthermore, by introducing a variable  conjugate to logr with respect to k, rk,r = ,
we may use (q, q, ) as a new set of independent variables to rewrite the metric and the

condition (13) for the (hyper)-kahler manifold. we obtain the following result for the

kahler metric

ds2 =

1

2   r

r,!(cid:18)d +

i
r

2

(r,qdq  r, qdq)(cid:19)

+

1

2 (cid:18)r,

r (cid:19) (d2 + 4rdqdq),

whereas the hyper-kahler condition (13) becomes [8]

(logr),q q + r, = 0,

(14)

(15)

which is the toda eld equation for su(n) in the continual large n limit [9, 10].

the local coordinate system (14) is called the toda frame and naturally the function

r = exp is called the toda potential of the metric. the change of variables (q, q, r) 
(q, q, ) can be viewed as a legendre transform in the sense that the function

f (q, q, )  logr  k(q, q, r)

(16)

is the hamiltonian for the lagrangian k with momentum  and velocity variable
logr. according to this we have the relation k/logr  rk,r = , as required. then,
f, = logr and r = exp is considered as a function of q, q and . this concludes our
general description of the kahler structure for 4-dim hyper-kahler manifolds with a selected

non-triholomorphic isometry, generated by /, using the toda theory approach.

for the atiyah-hitchin metric we consider the non-triholomorphic isometry generated

by / and then by application of twistor methods one shows that an appropriate choice

for f is [11]

f = 

1

i i0

d
 3

2() +ia

d
 2

().

(17)

here, the rst term is given by a contour integral around the origin and the second by a

contour integral over the a-cycle of the riemann surface for the twistor space curve (6),

8

which is the same as in donaldsons description of the moduli space. in this context, f is
a function of the variables z, v and w given by eq. (7), but it follows that it can be used

as a generating function for the kahler coordinate q. namely, we have

q =

f
v

=

1

2 ia

d
 

,

whereas f,w = 0 follows by inspection. as for the other kahler coordinate p we have

p = 2( = 0) = 

1
4

k 2(k)e2isin2(cid:16)1 + k2sinh2(cid:17)

(18)

(19)

and so 2 + arg(1 + k 2sinh2) provides the (shifted) killing coordinate /2.

the construction of kahler coordinates q, p by twistor methods provide a highly non-

trivial transcendental solution of the underlying continual toda eld equation. the choice

(17) for f is such that it remains inert under the so(2) rotations u = exp(i) taking
  u  and   u . in turn, the variables q and p given by eqs. (18) and (19) transform
as follows, q  u 1q and p  u 2p. we note at this point that there is another pair of
kahler coordinates, since their choice is not unique,

p = 2p  qb0,

q = qp  log(cid:18)a0 +qb0a1(cid:19) ,

(20)

which is preferable in the sense that the so(2) rotations leave q inert, whereas p  u p,
2 = 1 used in donaldsons
and connect directly with the variables of the curve a0

2  b0a1

description (see eqs. (10), (11)). we may now drop the tildes and use donaldsons variables

(20) to describe the kahler coordinates of the metric (14) and the corresponding toda eld

equation (15), viewing the pair (18) and (19) only as an intermediate choice for the atiyah-

hitchin space. in any case, the standard holomorphic 2-form on the ane surface in c 3,

 =

da1  db0

a0

= 2dq  dp,

(21)

is not inert under the so(2) rotations u, since   u. as such it coincides with f1 +if2,
where f1 and f2 are the two real kahler forms of the space that form a doublet under the

selected so(2) isometry; the third one, f3, is a singlet and hence inert under u.

9

we conclude with a number of comments which we plan to address in detail elsewhere

[12]. first, the atiyah-hitchin space inherits the full isometry group so(3) by its very

construction, since fractional su(2) transformations (5) with euler angles ,  and 

have been used to roll up the elliptic curve (3) to (6). the four weierstrass points of

the riemann surface provide the zeros of the variable z and it can be veried that they

occur at cos2 = k2 and  = /2 or 3/2, where (6) reduces back to (3). these points

are the free eld points of the underlying toda eld equation (15) in the sense that exp

vanishes there; at these points the atiyah-hitchin metric develops coordinate singularity

in the form (14), since one has detg = (,exp)2 and , 6= 0. guided by the algebro-
geometric construction of the full space, starting from the free eld curve (3) and rolling it

up to (6) by fractional su(2) transformations, one hopes to device a free eld conguration

in the 2-dim subspace with coordinates (q, q) so that the transcendental solution for the

toda potential of the atiyah-hitchin space is reconstructed out of free elds in a group

theoretical fashion, as it is always the case with 2-dim toda eld equations (though here the

structure group is innite dimensional, su()). however, the ordinary free eld realization
of solutions is nothing else but a way to sum up the perturbative expansion around the

free eld conguration, which is provided by group theory in closed form, thanks to the

integrability of the underlying non-linear dierential equations. the correct way to address

this question here is to consider solutions of the toda eld equations dened on a riemann

surface, as indicated by the uniformization formulae (9) for the kahler coordinates, and not

on a 2-dim at euclidean space which is only appropriate for considering the asymptotic

form of the metric in the taub-nut limit [13]. then, the non-perturbative corrections,

due to instantons, which turn the perturbative quantum moduli space from taub-nut into

atiyah-hitchin in 3-dim n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theories [3], could be reinterpreted

as toron congurations in the toda frame. this point of view is certainly useful for future

generalizations to more complicated examples of algebraic surfaces in c 3 due to dancer [7].

second, the non-perturbative construction of kahler coordinates (in particular q) and

10

their generating function f by twistor methods in hyper-kahler geometry, where one intro-
duces an auxiliary curve () and then integrates over non-contractible cycles, is identical

in vein with the construction of kahler coordinates in quantum moduli spaces of n = 2

supersymmetric gauge theories a la seiberg-witten. we think that this analogy should be

explored further in view of future applications of twistors in the non-perturbative formula-

tion of strings via m-theory or f-theory, as well as in 10-dim supersymmetric yang-mills

theories.

finally, we should explore further the geometric role of large n toda theory in the

uniformization of algebraic curves in c 3 that admit a non-triholomorphic so(2) action,

like the atiyah-hitchin space and its generalizations thereof. in this way we hope to gain

better understanding of non-perturbative aspects of string theory, whereas the perturbative

formulation of strings, as we know it in terms of world-sheets, is provided by algebraic curves

in c 2 (ie riemann surfaces) and their uniformization via liouville theory. this is also an

interesting problem in geometry in its own right.
