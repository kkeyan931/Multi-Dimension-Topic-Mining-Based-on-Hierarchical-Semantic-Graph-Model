we nd the explicit coordinate transformation which links two exact cosmological solutions of
the brane world which have been recently discovered. this means that both solutions are exactly
the same with each other. one of two solutions is described by the motion of a domain wall in the
well-known 5-dimensional schwarzshild-ads spacetime. hence, we can easily understand the region
covered by the coordinate used by another solution.

the randall-sundrum brane world [1,2] may give drastic changes to the conventional gravity theory or cosmology 1.
since the 3-brane world is motivated by the relation between the 11-dimensional supergravity and e8  e8 superstring
theory [4], the drastic changes might be realistic. hence we have to seriously think of this scenario. in this respect,
the conventional 4-dimensional theory should be recovered in low energy limits. this recovery is easily conrmed on
a brane with positive tension [6,7]. hence for simplicity, hereafter, we will consider the single brane case with the
positive tension. for the brane world cosmology with negative tension, the issue is still in debate [611], because the
ne-tuning and radius stabilization problem seem to be necessary to recover the conventional einstein theory and the
single brane is not apparently acceptable.

recently several authors have found exact cosmological solutions in the brane world [1216] 2. in one of them,
the 3-brane is described as a domain wall moving in 5-dimensional black-hole geometries [12,13]. it may be worth
noting that the radiation dominated friedmann universe is also expected by the ads/cft correspondence [26,27].
another one was given by exactly solving the einstein equations in the gaussian normal coordinate [1416]. these
global solutions will be important to discuss its stability as the full spacetime, the gravitational force between two
bodies on the brane and the cosmological perturbation on the brane.

since each of the two solutions is general enough in each coordinate system, it is easily expected that both solutions
represent the same spacetime in dierent coordinate systems.
in this brief note, we give the explicit coordinate
transformation from the coordinate used in refs. [12,13] to the gaussian normal coordinate adopted in refs. [1416].
moreover, we identify the region which the gaussian normal coordinate covers.

as stated above, some authors [12,13] considered a domain-wall moving in the 5-dimensional schwarzshild-

ads(sch-ads) spacetimes [28] with the metric

ds2 = gdxdx = f (r)dt 2 +

dr2
f (r)

+ r2d2

k,

(1)

1 for earlier works on related scenarios, see refs. [3].
2 in this eld, a lot of works related have been done so far [8,1725].

where d2
and

k is a metric of a unit three-dimensional sphere, plane or hyperboloid for k = +1, 0 or 1, respectively,

f (r) = k +

r2
l2




r2 .

(2)

here, l (> 0) and  ( 0 for k = +1 or k = 0,  l2/4 for k = 1) are constants. the constant l gives the
curvature scale of the bulk spacetime. hereafter, we denote coordinates on the three-dimensional manifold (sphere,
plane or hyperboloid) by xi. therein the domain wall is the 3-brane, whose orbit is given by r = r(t ), and the bulk
spacetime is the 5-dimensional sch-ads spacetime. assuming the z2-symmetry which is inspired by the reduction
from m-theory to e8  e8 heterotic string theory [4], israels junction condition [5] gives the friedmann equation on
the brane:

(3)

a(cid:17)2
(cid:16) a

where the function r(t ) representing the orbit is reinterpreted as a scale factor a( ) with the proper time  , and 
is energy density of matter on the domain wall. here, 5 is the 5-dimensional gravitational constant, gn = 4
5/48,
4 = 4
52/12  3l2 and  is the vacuum energy on the brane. the deviation from the conventional friedmann
equation is expressed as the forth and fth terms in the right-hand side of eq. (3). the fth term comes from the
electric part of the 5-dimensional weyl tensor [6].

the form of eq. (1) seems simple enough to handle while a metric derived by several authors [1416] looks rather
complicated. however, as already explained above, it is expected that both of metrics express the same spacetime.
yet, the weyl tensor for the metric derived in refs. [1416] becomes zero in the limit of the innite value of the fth
coordinate (or the ane parameter in the gaussian normal coordinate). this implies that the limit of the innite
ane parameter does not correspond to the cauchy horizon since the weyl tensor cannot be zero except for the
conformal innity as long as the bulk spacetime is not exactly the anti-desitter spacetime. in order to show these
explicitly, we transform coordinates in the metric (1) so that the transformed coordinate system becomes a gaussian
normal coordinate system based on a hypersurface given by r = r(t ).

for the purpose of the coordinate transformation, let us consider geodesics which intersect with the hypersurface
r = r(t ) perpendicularly. note that these geodesics are spacelike and have zero xi-components, provided that the
hypersurface r = r(t ) is timelike. first, because of the existence of the killing eld (/t ) in the bulk spacetime,
the unit tangent vector u of a geodesic should satisfy

where e is an integration constant. hence, we obtain u as

g u(/t ) = e,

g uu = 1,

u =

e

f (r)

t pf (r) + e2r.

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

in the above, we assumed ui = 0 because we are interested only in geodesics whose tangent have zero xi-components.
the trajectory of the geodesic is given by

where w is the ane parameter. for the case of 4 + l2(e2 + k)2 > 0, the r-component can be integrated as

dx
dw

= u,

2r2 + l2(e2 + k) =p4l2 + l4(e2 + k)2 cosh [2l1(w + w0)],

where w0 is a constant. for the cases of 4 + l2(e2 + k)2 = 0 and 4 + l2(e2 + k)2 < 0, the r-component of
eq. (6) are integrated to give dierent expressions of r in terms of w. however, the nal form of the metric we shall
obtain below is common for all cases. hence, in the following arguments we show explicit calculation for the rst
case only. let us determine the constants e and w0 so that the geodesic intersects with the hypersurface r = r(t )
perpendicularly at t = t0 and that the ane parameter w is zero on the hypersurface:

u  g(r  r(t ))

at t = t0, r = r(t0),

2r2(t0) + l2(e2 + k) =p4l2 + l4(e2 + k)2 cosh (2l1w0),

p4l2 + l4(e2 + k)2

# ,

(9)

(10)

these can be solved to give

e = e(t0)  r(t0)s

f (r(t0))

f 2(r(t0))  r2(t0))

,

where we have taken a convention such that cosh1 x > 0 for x > 1. note that the set (t0, w, xi) can be considered
as a coordinate system.

next, we can introduce a new coordinate t so that t becomes a proper time on the hypersurface r = r(t ):

(cid:18) t
t0(cid:19)w,xi
w(cid:19)t0,xi
(cid:18) t

f (a(t))

=

pf (a(t)) + a2(t)
xi(cid:19)t0,w
=(cid:18) t

= 0,

,

(11)

(12)

where a(t) = r(t0(t)). note that the function a(t) is well-dened in a whole coordinate patch as well as on the
hypersurface r = r(t ), or w = 0, since both t and t0 are constant along the geodesic. in this coordinate, e(t0) given
by eq. (9) has a simple expression

where a dot denotes (/t)w,xi. hence, by substituting eqs. (13) and (10) into eq. (7), we can rewrite the original
coordinate r in terms of new coordinates t and w as

e(t0) =  a(t),

(13)

r2 = (t, w)a2(t),

where

(t, w) = cosh (2l1w) +

l2
2

here h(t) is dened by

(h 2 + ka2)(cosh (2l1w)  1) p1 + l2(h 2 + ka2  a4) sinh (2l1w).

h(t) =

a(t)
a(t)

.

(14)

(15)

(16)

now let us conrm that the new coordinate system (t, w, xi) is actually a gaussian normal coordinate system. for

this purpose, it is sucient to show that

or

dw = gudx ,

t(cid:19)r,xi
(cid:18) w
(cid:18) w
r(cid:19)t,xi
xi(cid:19)t,r
(cid:18) w

=  a(t),

= pf (r) + a2(t)

f (r)

.,

= 0

is integrable. the integrability condition ddw = 0 is equivalent to

t(cid:19)r,xi
(cid:18) t

/(cid:18) t

r(cid:19)t,xi

= 

f (r)pf (r) + a2

a

.

this condition is easily conrmed by using the relation

3

(17)

(18)

(19)

and

t(cid:19)r,xi
(cid:18) t

/(cid:18) t

r(cid:19)t,xi

= (cid:18) r

w(cid:19)t,xi

/(cid:18) t

w(cid:19)t,xi

,

w(cid:19)t,xi
(cid:18) t
w(cid:19)t,xi
(cid:18) r

=(cid:18) t
=(cid:18) r

w(cid:19)t0,xi
w(cid:19)t0,xi

= ut = 

a(t)
f (r)

,

= ur = pf (r) + a2.

(20)

(21)

finally, we can calculate (r/t)w,xi from (14) as well as (t /w)t,xi and (r/w)t,xi from (21). moreover, from

eq. (18),

(cid:18) t
t (cid:19)w,xi

/(cid:18) r

t(cid:19)w,xi

= (cid:18) w

r(cid:19)t,xi

/(cid:18) w

t(cid:19)r,xi

= pf (r) + a2

f (r) a(t)

.

thus, it is easily shown that

ds2 = 

2(t, w)
(t, w)

dt2 + (t, w)a(t)2d2

k + dw2,

(22)

(23)

where

(t, w)   +

1

2h (cid:18) 

t(cid:19)w,xi

= cosh (2l1w) +

l2
2

(h 2 + h)(cosh (2l1w)  1) 

by dening k and c by

k = 2l1,
c = l2,

the functions (t, w) and (t, w) are rewritten as

(t, w) = cosh (kw) + 2k2(h 2 + h)(cosh (kw)  1) 

1 + l2

2 (2h 2 + h + ka2)
p1 + l2(h 2 + ka2  a4)

sinh (2l1w).

(24)

1 + 2k2(2h 2 + h + ka2)

p1 + 4k2(h 2 + ka2) + ca4)

sinh (kw),

(t, w) = cosh (kw) + 2k2(h 2 + ka2)(cosh (kw)  1) p1 + 4k2(h 2 + ka2) + ca4) sinh (kw).

using the friedmann equation of eq. (3) and setting c = c4
5l2, we can see that the metric (23) with (26) is equivalent
to the expression obtained in ref. [14]. as shown in refs. [1416] the lower signs should be taken in all equations if
we glue two copies of the region w  0 to obtain the brane-world with positive tension. thus, hereafter, we take the
lower signs.

from now on we show where the gaussian normal coordinate covers in the sch-ads spacetime. for simplicity,
we will consider only 4 = 0 cases. we concentrate on the  6= 0 cases since the  = 0 case is easier and can be
understood in a similar way. note that the metric (1) has an event horizon at r = rh, where rh is given by

(25)

(26)

(27)

r2
h =

l2
2

(pk 2 + 4l2  k).

in the following arguments we shall show that the gaussian normal coordinate system (t, w, xi) covers the region
beyond the event horizon and the wormhole.

first, let us consider the case when the condition

is satised. for k = +1, this condition is automatically satised since   0 for the bulk black hole spacetimes. this
conditions is automatically satised also when k = 0 and ha 6= 0. in this case, it is easily shown that

(h 2a2 + k)2 + 4l2 > 0

(28)

4

and that

where

r2
min =

r2 = (t, w)a(t)2   (w  )

r2 = (t, w)a(t)2  r2

min,

(w  0)

l2

2 hp(h 2a2 + k)2 + 4l2  (h 2a2 + k)i .

(29)

(30)

(31)

note that rmin(t) has been determined by the variation of w under a xed t. the equality in eq.(30) holds at
w = wmin(t), where wmin(t) (> 0) is given by

cosh (2l1wmin(t)) =

.

(32)

2l2a2 + h 2a2 + k

p(h 2a2 + k)2 + 4l2

we can easily show that rmin  0 and wmin  0 as a  0 by using the friedmann equation on the brane. on the
other hand, there is another minimum r
min(w) which is determined by the variation of t under a xed w. the orbit
min(w) is the same as (t, w) = 0 because  is proportional to tr2. these minimum will be important when we
of r
draw the conformal diagram.

now it is easily shown by using the lower-limit of  (  0 for k = +1 and k = 0,   l2/4 for k = 1, and
h. the equality holds if and only if ha = 0. hence, the coordinate

we are considering the  6= 0 case) that r2
(t, w, xi) actually covers the region beyond the event horizon and the wormhole.

min  r2

next, let us consider the case when k = 1 and the condition

(h 2a2  1)2 + 4l2 = 0

is satised. in this case, r2 approaches to a nite value in the limit w  :

r2 = (t, w)a(t)2 

l2
2

(1  h 2a2) <

l2
2

(w  ).

on the other hand,

r2
h >

l2
2

.

therefore, the coordinate (t, w, xi) reaches the region beyond the event horizon.

finally, let us consider the case of k = 1 and the time when condition

(h 2a2  1)2 + 4l2 < 0

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

is satised. in this case, there exists a value of w (> 0) such that r2 = 0. note that r = 0 corresponds to a singularity
inside the horizon since tetrad components of the weyl tensor for the metric (1) diverge at r = 0. thus, the coordinate
(t, w, xi) covers the region inside the event horizon and reaches the singularity inside the horizon.

now it is easy to see the global structure. figure 1 is for  > 0, k = +1. figure 2 is for  > 0, k = 0, 1. figures
3 and 4 are for  = 0, k = +1 and for  = 0, k = 0, 1, respectively. figure 5 is for  < 0, k = 1. in these
gures, the region covered by the gaussian normal coordinate is expressed as the shaded region. note that in figures
1, 2 and 5, for a non-zero small value of w, t should be past directed for small t, turns to the opposite direction at a
time t when the orbit of t reaches the r

min(w), and future directed for large t.

to obtain these gures, we have used the following two facts. first, the hypersurface t = t0 is always spacelike, and
should come in contact with the hypersurface r = rmin(t0) at w = wmin(t0), where t0 is a constant. secondly, for a
xed w, r   in the limits a  0 and a  , providing some reasonable assumptions (eg. 4 = 0 and a2  0 in
the limit a  ). this means that the constant-t hypersurface should become null in these limits.

in this brief note, we have given the coordinate transformation between the metric of eq. (1) and of eq. (23). as a
result, we could see the region where the gaussian normal coordinate covers. for general cases of single brane with the
positive tension and  6= 0, the coordinate w labelling the extra dimension does not terminate at the cauchy horizon
and goes beyond the event horizon. for some cases, the coordinate goes through the wormhole and reaches another
domain of communication where we can dene the total energy well [29]. the energy should be  for cases which
we considered and we can prove the positivity on the slice without naked singularities at least k = 0 cases [30,31].

5

this might argue us to consider general issues such as the positivity of the adm energy [32], cosmic no-hair [33],
singularity theorem [34] and so on. according to ref. [6], the eective 4-dimensional einstein equation is given by

(4)g = 4q + 8gn t + 4

5  e ,

(37)

where t is the energy-momentum tensor on the brane,  is a quadratic term of t , and e = (5)cnn
is the electric part of the 5-dimensional weyl tensor. it is important to clarify whether the right-hand side of eq.
(37) satises the local energy condition [34] or not, because it is closely related to many interesting subjects such as
stability of the minkowski spacetime. for the sch-ads spacetime, e00  /a4 and then e00  0 is guaranteed by
the above argument. this indicates the tendency such that the right-hand side satises the local energy condition.
however, we know that the perturbation analysis on the randall & sundrum brane world implies e00  0 [35]. hence,
we cannot quickly give the denite answer on the signature. this is crucial problem for general issues.

fig. 1. the global structure for  > 0, k = +1. the world volume of the brane starts at r = 0 and ends at r = 0. the
function rmin(t) increases from zero to rh, and decreases to zero. accordingly, the hypersurface w = wmin(t) starts at r = 0
with the brane, passes through the bifurcating point of the horizon, and ends at r = 0 with the brane. thus, the region covered
by the gaussian normal coordinate should be the shaded region. two dashed lines in the gure are a constant-t hypersurface
and a constant-w hypersurface.

fig. 2. the global structure for  > 0, k = 0, 1. the world volume of the brane starts at r = 0 and ends at r = .
the function rmin(t) starts with the value zero and ends with the value rmin(), where rmin() = rh for k = 0 and
rmin() = (l2)1/4 < rh for k = 1. (we have assumed that 4 = 0 and a2
 0 in the limit a  .) thus, the region
covered by the gaussian normal coordinate should be the shaded region. note that hypersurfaces w = wmin(t) and (t, w) = 0
start at the point where the brane starts, and end at the point where r = rmin() comes in contact with the horizon. two
dashed lines in the gure are a constant-t hypersurface and a constant-w hypersurface.

fig. 5. the global structure for  < 0, k  1. the world volume of the brane starts at r = 0 and ends at r = . the
minimum of r for a xed t becomes zero in the limits a  0 and a  . thus, the region covered by the gaussian normal
coordinate should be the shaded region. note that hypersurfaces w = wmin(t) and (t, w) = 0 start at the point where the
brane starts, and end at r = 0. two dashed lines in the gure are a constant-t hypersurface and a constant-w hypersurface.
