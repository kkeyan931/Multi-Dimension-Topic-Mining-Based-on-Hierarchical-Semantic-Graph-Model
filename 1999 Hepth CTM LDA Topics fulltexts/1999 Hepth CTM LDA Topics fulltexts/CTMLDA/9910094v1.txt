abstract

we consider freely acting orbifold compactications, which interpolate in two possi-

ble decompactication limits between the supersymmetric type ii string and the non-

supersymmetric type 0 string.

in particular we discuss how d-branes are incorporated

into these orbifold models. investigating the open string spectrum on d3-branes, we will
show that one can interpolate in this way between n = 4 supersymmetric u (n ) respec-
tively u (2n ) yang-mills theories and non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theories
with adjoint massless scalar elds plus bifundamental massless fermions in a smooth way.

finally, by lifting the orbifold construction to m-theory, we conjecture some duality re-

lations and show that in particular a new supersymmetric branch of gauge like theories

emanate for the non-supersymmetric model.

1. introduction

as it became clear during the recent years, the emergence of (p + 1)-dimensional,

supersymmetric gauge theories from open strings living on the world volumes of dp-branes

in closed string theories provides very important insights into the perturbative and non-

perturbative gauge theory dynamics. of particular interest is the limit in which the closed

(bulk) string degrees of freedom decouple from the open (boundary) degrees of freedom;

this limit is provided on the u (n ) gauge theory side by taking the number of color degrees
of freedom to be very large, n  , whereas on the closed string side the same limit is
achieved by considering the classical weak coupling limit, gs  0. quite surprisingly, there
is in fact a very striking duality between the open string gauge theories on the boundary

and the closed string gravitational theories in the bulk, stating that superconformal gauge

theories in the large n limit are dual to type ii superstring theories in anti-de-sitter

background spaces [1-3]. the most well understood example is given by the duality between
n = 4, u (n ) yang-mills gauge theory and supergravity in an ads5  s5 background.

of course the most interesting problem is to explore the cft/ads duality for models

which allow for (spontaneous) breaking of space-time supersymmetry. one way to break

supersymmetry in four dimensions is to consider models with non-zero temperature [4]. a

dierent and perhaps more direct way to construct non-supersymmetric string models is

provided by the type 0 string construction [5-7] following an idea by polyakov [8]. seen

from a world sheet point a view the non-supersymmetric type 0a/b theories are simply

obtained by a non-supersymmetric, but nevertheless modular invariant gso projection

[9,10], such that the spectrum of closed strings is purely bosonic. alternatively the type

0 strings can be constructed as an orbifold of type ii superstring theory [11] by modding
out the symmetry (1)fs, where fs denotes the space-time fermion number. in this way
all closed string fermions in the (r,ns) and (ns,r) are projected out by the zz2 action,

whereas the twisted sector contains an (ns,ns) tachyon and in addition a second set of

massless (r,r) elds. this has the important eect that the d-branes present in type 0

theories are essentially doubled compared to the supersymmetric type ii parent theories.

we will call the two dierent kinds of p-dimensional d-branes (electric) dp and (magnetic)
dp-branes. implementing the (1)fs projection in the open string sector, it turns out that
the open strings stretched between d-branes of the same kind, i.e. between dp and dp-

branes respectively between dp and dp-branes, lead to space-time bosons, in particular

to massless gauge bosons and massless scalar elds. on the other hand, open strings

1

between dp and dp-branes lead to space-time fermions. let us mention that recently also

non-supersymmetric tachyon-free compactications of both type ii string theory [12-16]

and type 0 string theory [17-23] were discussed.

using this construction an interesting class of non-supersymmetric gauge models arises

when considering an equal number of n electric d3 and n magnetic d3-branes in type
0b string theory. this conguration leads to a non-supersymmetric u (n )e  u (n )m
gauge theory with bosonic and fermionic massless matter arranged in such a way that

the -function vanishes to leading order in 1/n .

in fact, klebanov and tseytlin [5-7]

gave reasonable evidence that this gauge theory is again dual to a tachyon-free gravity
background of the form ads5  s5 just as in the supersymmetric type iib theory. putting
the type 0b d3-branes on transversal singularities [24-27] or considering type 0a hanany-

witten [28] like brane constructions a full variety of non-supersymmetric gauge theories
(u (n )e  u (n )m)k can be constructed [29-33], where k is a number which characterizes
the singularity type or the number of ns 5-branes in the hanany-witten set up. all

these models are bose-fermi degenerated and have the same one-loop -functions as their
corresponding u (n )k type ii parent models. this correspondence becomes even more
close by noting that the gauge theory given by the diagonal u (n )e+m  u (n )e  u (n )m
is identical to the gauge theory of the underlying type ii theory. therefore one might

conjecture that there exists a smooth interpolation between the supersymmetric u (n )
gauge theories and the non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) models in such a way that
supersymmetry is smoothly broken (installed) along the line of deformation. since the
u (n )e  u (n )m gauge theories do not contain any massless scalars elds with the right
quantum numbers to trigger the symmetry breaking to the diagonal group u (n )e+m via
the usual eld theoretical higgs mechanism, one has to consider the couplings between the

open string boundary modes to the closed string bulk modes in order to realize the desired

interpolation.

one well established way to break supersymmetry in a smooth way is provided by the

scherk-schwarz mechanism [34-39]. this class of models is built as freely acting orbifolds

with dierent boundary conditions for bosons and fermions, very similar to strings at

nite temperature [40-45]. sending the radius r of the orbifold to innity (to zero) space-

time supersymmetry is recovered. recently scherk-schwarz supersymmetry breaking was

studied in type i compactications [46-49] and also in m-theory [50]. moreover the scherk-

schwarz mechanism was also used to show that there exist indeed two types of models

which smoothly interpolate between the closed type iia/b and type 0a/b theories [51].

2

they can be either realized as a freely acting orbifold of type ii on s1/(1)fss, where
s denotes a half shift on the circle, or alternatively as a freely acting orbifold of type 0
on s1/(1)fls, where fl is the left-moving world sheet fermion number. in the former
case supersymmetry is recovered for innite radius of the circle, whereas in the latter case

the zero radius limit is fully supersymmetric. these interpolating models are expected

to exhibit a hagedorn phase transition at the special critical radius of the circle where

a tachyonic mode arises [42-45]. the freely acting orbifold of type iia can also be lifted

to m-theory [51]. in this case it was postulated in [51] that the strong coupling regime
of type 0a is given by m-theory on s1/(1)fss. taking this conjecture seriously, one
implication is that at strong coupling the type 0a string becomes supersymmetric in the

bulk. moreover, the closed string tachyon becomes massive at strong coupling and at the

same time, fermions, which are of solitonic nature in the type 0a string, become light and

provide the massless (r-ns) fermions of the closed type iia superstring.

in this paper we will extend this construction including also the d-branes and the

corresponding open strings into the orbifolds which interpolate between type ii and type

0 strings.

in this way we will show that one can smoothly interpolate between broken

and unbroken gauge theories and at the same time between supersymmetric and non-

supersymmetric models in a way not known before from eld theory. we will rst consider
type iia/b compactied on s1/(1)fss where n dp-branes (p even (odd) for type a(b))
are either wrapped around the orbifold circle, or are placed transversal to it.
in the
former case one interpolates between a (p + 1)-dimensional, n = 4 supersymmetric u (2n )
gauge theory at innite radius and a p-dimensional, non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n )
gauge at zero radius. in case of transversal branes, the innite radius limit of the orbifold
provides an n = 4 supersymmetric u (n ) gauge theory in p + 1 dimensions whereas in the
zero radius limit a non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory in p + 2 dimensions
appears. we extend this construction by considering two-dimensional type iia/b orbifold
compactications on s1  s1/(1)fss.
compact space one can interpolate between supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric gauge

in turns out that varying the two radii of the

theories living in the same space-time dimension. a similar, in fact t-dual, picture arises
from d-branes of type 0a/b on s1/(1)fls and on s1  s1/(1)fls, respectively.

finally we will discuss how this construction can be embedded into m-theory.

here again the m-theory moduli allow to interpolate between weakly coupled non-

supersymmetric gauge theories and strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theories in

3

a smooth way. in contrast to the string theory embeddings, here one of the radii is re-

lated to the gauge coupling constant, so that one is really interpolating between small

and strong gauge coupling. taking the non-supersymmetric dualities seriously, we are led

to strong-weak coupling dualities for the non-supersymmetric gauge theories. moreover,

we see that non-supersymmetric gauge theories contain new branches at strong coupling,

which are supersymmetric, but not all stringy degrees of freedom are decoupled.

2. type ii compactications on freely acting orbifolds

2.1. supersymmetry restoration in the bulk

in this section we briey review the smooth orbifold construction of [51] which pro-

duces type 0 from type ii and vice versa. one starts with the type iia (b) superstring
compactied in the ninth direction on a circle s1 of radius rii
9 . in the limit rii
unbroken supercharges for every value of rii

9 . the theory contains 32
9   the kalazu-klein
modes become massless and one recovers the type iia (b) superstring in ten dimensions.
on the other hand, for rii
9  0 the winding modes become massless and the theory is now
identical to the type iib (a) superstring in ten dimensions. this is what is usually called

t-duality between the type iia/b superstring [52,53] (for a recent discussion on iia/iib

t-duality and m-theory see [54]).

at the next step we build the orbifold type iia (b) on s1/(1)fs of radius r0

9. this
zz2 projection breaks all 32 supercharges and the resulting theory is nothing else than the
type 0 string compactied on s1 with purely bosonic spectrum in the closed string bulk.
for large r0
9  0
the ten-dimensional type 0b (a) string is present. hence t -duality among type 0a/b just

9   the type 0a (b) string in ten dimensions emerges whereas for r0

works like for the type iia/b superstring pair.

finally we combine the action of the zz2 (1)fs orbifold projection with the half-shift
s along the circle, i.e. we are now considering type iia (b) on the freely acting orbifold
s1/(1)fss of radius r9. for nite values of r9 all 32 supercharges are broken in the
sense that all 32 gravitinos are massive with mass of order 1/r9. in the limit r9  
the gravitinos become massless, and one obtains the closed string spectrum of the ten-
dimensional type iia (b) superstring. on the other hand, for r9  0 the gravitinos
become innitely heavy such that they completely decouple, and one regains the spectrum
of the type 0a (b) for r0
9=0. so eectively, using also the type 0 t-duality, the limit
r9  0 of type iia (b) on this orbifold is given by the ten-dimensional type 0b (a) string

4

theory. there is a tachyon for r9 < 2, which decouples in the limit r9  . therefore

one expects a hagedorn phase transition at this radius [43-45]. note that at innite radius
the two moduli spaces of type ii compactied on the circle s1 and of type ii compactied
on the orbifold s1/(1)fss meet. in the same way, at r9 = 0 the moduli space of type 0
on s1 and of type ii on s1/(1)fss have a common intersection.
2.2. d-branes and open strings in type ii on s1/(1)fs s

first let us briey recall the d-brane spectrum of type 0 strings. as already mentioned,
the (1)fs projection removes all closed string fermions from the untwisted sector and leads
to a tachyon and further massless rr elds in the twisted sector. computing the spectrum

one nds that all states in the rr sector are doubled implying that all dp-branes (p odd

in type 0b, p even in type 0a) are doubled, as well.

in particular, in the case of d3-

branes there now exist (electric) d3 and (magnetic) d3-branes. using the boundary state

approach it was shown in [19] that indeed the boundary state representing a dp-brane

in type ii splits into two boundary states of type 0. the explicit form of the boundary

states was used to derive rules for open strings stretched between the various types of

dp-branes. open strings stretched between the same kind of dp-branes carry only space-

time bosonic modes, whereas open strings stretched between a dp and a dp-brane carry

only space-time fermionic modes. the massless spectrum living on the d3-branes is given
by a four-dimensional gauge theory with gauge group g = u (n )  u (n ), three complex
bosons in the adjoint and four weyl-fermions in the (n, n) + (n, n) representation of g.

it follows that the one-loop -function vanishes, and as was shown explicitly in [6] the

two-loop -function vanishes in the large n limit. in the next to leading order one obtains
a non-vanishing contribution to the two-loop -function coecient, b2 = 16. thus, the
gauge theory is free in the infrared.

next consider the type ii string compactied on s1/(1)fs. first we discuss the case
where the circle s1 is transversal to the dp and dp-branes such that the d-branes take
certain positions on s1. in addition to the open strings discussed before there are also
winding open strings which are wrapped n-times around s1 before their ends are stuck at

the d-branes. therefore we call this case the winding picture. the masses of these winding
states are proportional to |nr0
9   the winding modes become
heavy and decouple. on the other hand for r0
9  0 an innite number of winding modes
becomes massless, which means that eectively the world volume dimension of a dp-brane

9|. on the one hand, for r0

grows by one unit.

5

alternatively we can also decide to put the compact circle along one of the world

volume directions of the dp-branes. this is called the momentum picture, since there are
open strings on the dp(p)-branes which carry discrete momenta of the order m/r0
these states become light in the limit r0
tion limit r0

9. hence
9  , but decouple in the other decompactica-
9   limit the dimension of the brane world-volume

9  0. thus, in the r0

is eectively enlarged.

after these considerations we are now ready to discuss the d-branes and open strings

within the compactication of type ii string on the orbifold s1/(1)fss.
(i) the winding picture: transversal dp-branes

for concreteness let us consider the type iib string compactied on a circle of ra-

dius r9. we place 2n transversal d3-branes in this background and divide by the
zz2 operation t = (1)fss. the shift acts on a momentum/winding ground state as
s|m, ni = (1)m|m, ni. let us rst consider the range 0 < r9 <  and then consider the
two possible limits. requiring that t is indeed a symmetry of the background, we have

to make sure that the d3-branes are arranged in such a way that t transforms one brane

into another. we will place n branes at a position x9 = a = 0 on the circle and n branes

at x9 = b = r9/2. therefore we deal with two kinds of winding strings in the open string

sector. first there are the aa- and bb-sectors with open strings between two d3-branes

either at x9 = 0 or at x9 = r9/2 and integer winding numbers w = nr9. their masses

are given by

m 2  (nr9)2.

(2.1)

second in the ab- and ba-sectors there are open strings stretched between one d3-brane

at x9 = 0 and one other d3-brane at x9 = r9/2. these states have half-inter winding
numbers w = (n + 1

2 )r9, and their masses are given by

m 2  ((n +

1
2

)r9)2.

hence the ground state in the ab(ba)-sector is massive for nite r9.

the natural action of t on the chan-paton factors of these branes is given by

t =(cid:18) 0

0(cid:19)2n,2n

(2.2)

(2.3)

so that the branes at x9 = 0 are mapped to the branes at x9 = r9/2. computing the

annulus amplitude for open string stretched between two d3-branes is straightforward and

gives

with argument e2t. the rst term with integer windings is from open strings stretched

between branes at the same location and the second term with half-integer windings is from

open strings stretched between branes at opposite locations of the circle. it is straight-

forward to compute the massless spectrum.

in the range r9 > 0 we obtain the four

dimensional supersymmetric spectrum shown in table 1.

thus the massless spectrum in the aa and bb sectors is exactly the one of u (n ) n = 4
super yang-mills theory in four space-time dimensions. in the limit r9   the mass
of the other winding states becomes innite and they decouple. therefore we are dealing
with four-dimensional u (n ) n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills in this decompactication
limit.

in the r9  0 limit however an innite number of winding states in the aa and
bb sectors becomes massless. this has the eect that the gauge theory now lives in one

dimension higher. moreover the gauge group gets enlarged, as now open strings in the ab

and ba sectors stretched between the d3-branes at locations a and b become massless.

table 2: winding picture: open string spectrum of s1/t for r9 = 0

this is precisely the mass spectrum of type 0b with n electric d3 plus n magnetic

d3-branes but at zero radius r0b

9 = 0. this means that the non-supersymmetric gauge
theory actually lives in ve space-time dimensions, i.e. this limit is nothing else than the
type 0a string with a non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory arising from n
electric d4 plus n magnetic d4-branes.

in summary, so far we have constructed an interpolating model between four-
dimensional n = 4 super ym theory at r9   and a special ve-dimensional non-
supersymmetric gauge theory at r9  0. the additional massless states appear in the
winding sector of open strings; hence there is no eld theoretic description for them. r9
is a purely stringy parameter, which is not present in conventional gauge theory. the

corresponding closed string modulus eld in the bulk is coupled to the open strings in the

boundary and provides at the same time the supersymmetry restoration and the gauge

symmetry breaking on the d-branes.

of course, this picture can be immediately generalized considering 2n dp-branes, p
even (odd), in type iia(b) superstring compactied on s1/(1)fss, where again half
of the dp-branes are positioned at x9 = 0 and the other half sit at x0 = r9/2.
in
this way one interpolates between supersymmetric type iia(b) dp-branes at r9  
and non-supersymmetric type 0b(a) d(p+1)-, d(p+1)-branes at r9  0. in the open
string sector one is smoothly interpolating between (p+1)-dimensional supersymmetric
u (n ) yang-mills theory with 16 supercharges at r9 =  and (p+2)-dimensional non-
supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) yang-mills theory at r9 = 0.

8

(ii) the momentum picture: wrapped dp-branes

now let us discuss the case where the orbifold s1/(1)fss lies in one of the world
volume directions of the d-branes, i.e. the d-branes are wrapped around the compact

orbifold. the open string states again split into two sectors, namely momentum states

with even momenta p9 = 2m/r9 and masses

m 2  (2m)2/r2
9,

(2.6)

and in general dierent states with odd momenta p9 = (2m + 1)/r9 and corresponding

masses

m 2  (2m + 1)2/r2
9.

(2.7)

to be specic consider 2n d4-branes of type iia wrapped in this way. for nite values of

r9 the resulting gauge theory lives in four uncompactied space-time dimensions, whereas
in the r9   limit momentum modes are massless, and the gauge theory become ve-
dimensional. since in the r9  0 limit we would like to obtain the non-supersymmetric
gauge theory with gauge group u (n )  u (n ) we make the following choice for the action
of t on the chan-paton labels

0

t =(cid:18) i

0 i(cid:19)2n,2n

in order to obtain the precise form of the spectrum we compute the annulus diagram for

we see indeed that the massless spectrum is the one of four-dimensional, non-
supersymmetric yang-mills with gauge group u (n )u (n ). the massless spectrum agrees
with the open string spectrum of d3- and d3-branes in the type 0b string. therefore in
the limit r9  0 the massive states with masses proportional to (2m + 1)/r9 decouple,
and we get precise agreement with the type 0b string.

the limit r9   provides on the other hand an innite number of new massless mo-
mentum states which enhance the gauge symmetry to the group u (2n ) and also restores

space-time supersymmetry. so in the large radius limit the spectrum is given by super-

symmetric u (2n ) yang-mills theory in ve space-time dimensions, where 16 supercharges

are preserved in the open string theory.

in general starting with 2n wrapped dp-branes in type iia(b) on s1/(1)fss one

interpolates between the following two decompactication limits:
r9  0: n d(p-1) and n d(p-1)-branes of type 0b(a) with p-dimensional, non-
supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory.
r9  : 2n dp-branes of type iia(b) with (p+1)-dimensional, supersymmetric u (2n )
gauge theory.

2.3. d-branes and open strings in type ii on s1  s1/(1)fs s

so far we have interpolated between supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric gauge

theories living in dierent number of space-time dimensions. now we will extend the dis-

cussion by compactifying the type ii string on a two-dimensional compact space given by
s1  (s1/(1)fss) characterized by the two radii r8 and r9. using the t-duality on
the compact circle in x8 we can now smoothly interpolate between d-branes of the same
world volume dimensions, and hence also between non-supersymmetric and supersymmet-

ric gauge theories of the same dimensionality.

(i) the winding picture: transversal dp-branes

let us consider 2n dp-branes in type iia(b) which are transversal to both the x8 and
the x9 direction. the positions of the dp-branes on the orbifold circle are as discussed in
section (2.1). the spectrum of this theory follows without large eorts from the previous

discussion. for nite values of the two radii r8 and r9 we are dealing with a (p+1)-
dimensional gauge theory, living on the world volume of the dp-branes. the massless

states are those of maximally supersymmetric u (n ) yang-mills gauge theory. of particular

interest are the following four possible decompactication limits:

10

a) r8  , r9  : here we are dealing with dp-branes of type iia(b), and the
corresponding gauge theory is (p+1)-dimensional, supersymmetric yang-mills with u (n )

gauge group.

b) r8  0, r9  : this limit describes d(p+1)-branes of type iib(a) with (p+2)-
dimensional, supersymmetric u (n ) gauge theory.

c) r8  , r9  0: now the decompactication limit corresponds to self-dual d(p+1)-
and d(p+1)-branes of type 0b(a) with non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory
in p+2 dimensions.

d) r8  0, r9  0: finally we obtain self-dual d(p+2), d(p+2)-branes of type 0a(b)
with non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory in p+3 dimensions.

therefore, in the winding picture the moduli space of this two-dimensional compact-

ication enables us to interpolate between n d3-branes of type iib and n self-dual d3,

d3-branes of type 0b. hence there exists a stringy interpolation mechanism between four-
dimensional, non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory with 6 adjoint scalars plus
4  {(n, n ) + (n, n )} weyl fermions and four-dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric u (n )
yang-mills theory. the supersymmetric u (n ) gauge group is just the diagonal subgroup
of the non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge symmetry.
(ii) the momentum picture: wrapped dp-branes

in the momentum picture we are considering 2n dp-branes which are wrapped both

in the x8 and also in the x9 directions. for nite values of the radii there is a non-
supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory with massless elds living in p-1 uncompact-
ied space-time dimensions. again we like to consider the four special decompactication

limits:

a) r8  , r9  : here we are dealing with dp-branes of type iia(b), and the
corresponding gauge theory is (p+1)-dimensional, supersymmetric yang-mills with u (2n )

gauge group.

b) r8  0, r9  : this limit describes d(p-1)-branes of type iib(a) with p-
dimensional, supersymmetric u (2n ) gauge theory.

c) r8  , r9  0: now the decompactication limit corresponds to self-dual d(p-1)-
and d(p-1)-branes of type 0b(a) with non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory
in p dimensions.

11

d) r8  0, r9  0: finally we obtain self-dual d(p-2), d(p-2)-branes of type 0a(b) with
non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory in p-1 dimensions.

we see that within the momentum picture one can again interpolate between 2n d3-

branes of type iib and n self-dual d3, d3-branes of type 0b. this time it provides an
interpolation mechanism between four-dimensional, non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n )
gauge theory with 6 adjoint scalars plus 4  {(n, n ) + (n , n )} weyl fermions and
four-dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric u (2n ) yang-mills theory. here the non-
supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge group is a regular subgroup of the supersymmetric
u (2n ) gauge symmetry.

3. type 0 compactications on freely acting orbifolds

alternatively we can start also with the type 0a (b) string compactied on s1. mod-
ding by (1)fl leads back to the type iia (b) superstring theories. it follows that the
compactication of type 0a (b) on the freely acting orbifold s1/(1)fls possesses the
following decompactication limits. for r9   one recovers the ten-dimensional non-
supersymmetric type 0a (b) theories and for r9  0 the ten-dimensional supersymmetric
type iib (a) theory arises. observe that now a tachyon develops for large radii r9 > 2.
as was shown in [51] the type 0a (b) orbifold is t-dual to the type iib (iia) orbifolds

discussed in the previous section, where the relation between the radii is rii = 2/r0. the
straightforward t-dual of the type iib (iia) over s1/(1)fs s orbifold is of course type
iia (iib) over s1/(1)fs s, where s is a shift in the momentum lattice acting as (1)n
on winding modes.

let us now discuss the properties of the d-branes and the gauge theories in the open

string sector within this orbifold compactication of the type 0 string. since the situation

is just t-dual to the orbifold compactication of the type ii strings discussed before, we

will only summarize the main results. in order to interpolate between type 0 and type

ii we will only allow for self-dual d-branes in the type 0 orbifolds, i.e. we are placing

n electric dp and n magnetic dp-branes either transversal to the orbifold or wrapped

around it.

(i) the winding picture: transversal dp-branes

here we are placing n electric dp and n magnetic dp-branes both at x9 = 0 and at
x9 = r9/2. the action of (1)fls on the cp-factors relates for instance a dp-brane at

12

x9 = 0 to a dp-brane at x9 = r9/2. using the t-duality relation between the type ii
and type 0 radii, one obtains exactly the annulus partition function in (2.9). for generic
radii the open string sector is given by (p+1)-dimensional, non-supersymmetric u (n ) 
u (n ) gauge theory. for r9  0 additional gauge bosons as well as their superpartners
become massless, such that this limit is described by d(p+1)-branes with associated n = 4
supersymmetric u (2n ) gauge theory in p+2 space-time dimensions. on the other hand,
for r9   we obtain the dp, dp-branes of type 0, and the gauge theory is non-
supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) yang-mills theory. of course, we can extend this picture
by considering a type 0 compactication on s1  s1/(1)fls.
in this way we get the
t-dual picture of the interpolating models discussed in section 2.3.

(ii) the momentum picture: wrapped dp-branes

here the situation is similar to the winding picture in the type ii orbifold compacti-

cation. we are wrapping n electric dp and n magnetic dp-branes around the circle and
using the t-duality relation for the radii we obtain the same result as in (2.4). for r9  0
the theory becomes n = 4 supersymmetric, but now with u (n ) gauge group. in contrast,
for r9   supersymmetry is completely broken but the gauge group is enhanced to
u (n )  u (n ).

4. m-theory embedding

4.1. the bulk theory

so far we have considered embeddings of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric

gauge theories into string theory and by varying some stringy parameters we have seen

that one can interpolate between them. unfortunately, this does not teach us anything

new about the dynamics of the non-supersymmetric gauge theories. therefore, we should

try to lift the whole picture to m-theory where at least one of the radii is related to the

string coupling constant and therefore to the gauge coupling constant.

let us briey review the suggestion of [51] where a freely acting orbifold of 11-

dimensional m-theory was constructed with the conjecture that the non-supersymmetric
type 0a string can be viewed as an m-theory compactication on s1/(1)fss. as a con-
sequence of this conjecture it follows that at small radius r10, i.e. at weak string coupling,
one recovers the non-supersymmetric type 0a string, whereas at large radius r10, i.e. at
strong string coupling, the maximally supersymmetric m-theory in 11 dimensions emerges.

13

hence the type 0a string should contain fermionic solitons with masses mf = 1/r10, and
the tachyon of type 0a should become massive at strong coupling. similarly it was argued

in [51] that the ten-dimensional type 0b string can be obtained as the zero volume limit
of m-theory on t 2/(1)fss.

so let us consider m-theory compactied on the freely acting orbifold s1s1/(1)fss.
the corresponding two radii are called r9 and r10.6 if the zz2 orbifold is in the x9 direction
then the previous perturbative discussion on the interpolation between supersymmetric

and non-supersymmetric theories applies. however if we exchange the role of the two

circles such that supersymmetry is broken by the m-theory coordinate x10, one has to
conclude that the type 0a string at weak coupling is given by m-theory on s1/(1)fss at
zero radius r10. varying the m-theory radius r10, i.e. the 0a coupling constant ga
10, one is
interpolating between m-theory with 32 supercharges and type 0a string with completely

broken supersymmetry. to be precise let us recall the well-known relations [55,56] be-

tween the string and m-theory parameters. first the relation between the string coupling
constant ga

10 and r10 is given by 7

ga

10 =(cid:18) r10

2 (cid:19)3/2

.

(4.1)

next we consider the compactication of m-theory to nine dimensions. the nine-
dimensional radius of type 0a on s1 is then related to the m-theory parameters as

whereas the nine-dimensional 0a string coupling constant reads

9 = r9r r10

(4.4)

6 radii measured in units of the 11-dimensional planck length l11 are denoted by small

letters. on the other hand, radii measured in units of the string scale  are denoted as before

by capital letters.

7 the relation between the type 0 parameters and m-theory parameters are as in the type

ii case except some additional factors of 2 due to the orbifoldization.

14

using these relations we are interested in the following three type iib (0b) limits.

9  : here we obtain the type 0b string at nite or zero

a) r9  0, r10  0 with rb
string coupling gb
10 = r10/2r9.
b) r9  0, r10   with rb
string with gb

10  .

9  : this limit describes the strongly coupled type iib

c) r9  , r10  0 with rb
string with gb

10  0.

9  : now one is dealing with the weakly coupled type 0b

let us now discuss how m-theory branes and the corresponding gauge theories can be

incorporated into this picture.

4.2. m2-branes

the membrane solution (m2-brane) of 11-dimensional supergravity plays a very im-

portant role in the relation between string theory and m-theory. upon circle compacti-

cation from 11 to 10 dimensions m2-branes with world volumes transversal to x10 can

be identied with the iia d2-branes. on the other hand, being wrapped around the

eleventh dimension the m2-brane provides the fundamental string of the iia superstring.

let us now discuss the fate of the m2-branes under the m-theory compactication on
s1  s1/(1)fss, where the orbifold lies in the x10 direction. as a rst set of membranes
we introduce 2n m2-branes which are completely unwrapped, so that their worldvolumes

are transversal to the compact two-dimensional orbifold. therefore this choice corresponds

to the winding picture discussed before. of course we have to place n m2-branes at oppo-

site positions on the circle. in order to obtain gauge theories the m2-branes are intersected

by another set of m2-branes which are wrapped around the orbi-circle in x10. hence from

the string point of view these wrapped membranes correspond to the open strings which

are responsible for the gauge symmetry degrees of freedom.

in order to see what the various limits of m-theory parameters mean for the corre-

sponding gauge theories we need the relations between string theory and m-theory pa-

rameters, where we measure all length scales in units of the 11-dimensional planck length

l11, which now appears explicitly in all formulas, i.e. r9 and r10 are now dimensionful(!)

quantities. focussing on type b quantities we obtain:

rb

9 =

2l3
11
r9r10

,

gb
10 =

r10
2r9

.

15

(4.5)

note that switching from rb

9 measured in string units to the radius measured in m-theory
units the following relation between the fundamental string scale  and l11 is required:

tf =

.

the ten-dimensional gravitational coupling constant is given by

2
10 =

.

(4.6)

(4.7)

in addition we also need the expression for the tension of the solitonic d1-strings and

d3-branes:

td1 =

l3
11

,

td3 =

t 2

10

r9 r10
2l6
11

.

(4.8)

in the following we like to consider the gauge theories in the limit rb

9  , i.e. in
the type b limit. moreover we like to study the behavior of the gauge theories in the limit
where the 11-dimensional planck length is small, i.e. l11 =   0.
a) r9 = a  0 (a > 0), r10 = b  0 (b > 0):
in order that rb

9   we have to require that a+b > 3. then this limit describes the non-
supersymmetric type 0b string. it contains n self-dual d3-branes. in order that the gauge

theory modes completely decouple from the perturbative as well as all non-perturbative
stringy modes we demand in addition that tf   and td1  . this provides a
further restriction on how r9 and r10 go to zero, namely a < 3 and also b < 3. choosing
the parameters in this way we have a non-supersymmetric u (n )u (n ) gauge theory with
6 adjoint scalars and 4+4 bifundamental fermions in four dimensions. the gauge theory
is weakly coupled, gy m = pgb
10  0, if b > a. moreover this non-supersymmetric gauge
theory is expected to possess an s-duality symmetry gy m  1/gy m , which is realized by
the exchange of r9 and r10. thus the strongly coupled non-supersymmetric u (n ) u (n )
gauge theory is obtained choosing a > b. of course, one has to be very careful with such

duality statements in the non-supersymmetric case, as the lack of supersymmetry does not

allow us to nd more supporting evidence for such a conjecture.

b) r9 = a  0 (a > 0), r10 = b  const. or  (b  0):
choosing the two radii in this way we run towards supersymmetry restoration; supersym-
metry is completely restored for r10  . again keeping rb

9 large we need a > 3 + b, i.e.

16

a > 3. then in the supersymmetric limit the n m2-branes can be viewed as type iib d3-
branes with open strings ending on them. the open strings lead to n = 4 supersymmetric
u (n ) gauge theory at very strong yang-mills gauge coupling gy m =pgb
10  . however
now the stringy modes do not decouple anymore. although the fundamental string tension

tf is still very large, the d1 string tension td1 goes to zero, since a > 3. this means that
we deal not only with strongly coupled n = 4 supersymmetric u (n ) yang-mills, but also
all d-stringy modes are present and do not decouple. we call this theory n = 4 msym.
c) r9 = a  const. or  (a  0), r10 = b  0 (b > 0):
in this limit supersymmetry is completely broken. asking for rb

9   it implies b > 3+a,
i.e. b > 3. then the n m2-branes can be viewed as self-dual type 0b d3-branes with
non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory at very weak yang-mill gauge coupling
gy m = pgb
10  0. now the elementary stringy modes do not decouple since tf  0
whereas td1  . this means that we deal not only with classical non-supersymmetric
u (n )  u (n ) yang-mills theory, but also all elementary stringy modes are present and
do not decouple. let us call this theory n = 0 mym theory. under exchange of the two
compact radii this case is mapped to the limit described in b.), implying some strong-weak

duality between these two supersymmetric resp. non-supersymmetric gauge theories.

in all three type iib (0b) limits the ten-dimensional gravitational coupling vanishes

and the tension of the d3-branes becomes innite, so that gravity and massive modes on

the d3-branes decouple properly. if we take the m-theory discussion seriously, it tells us
that the non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory can be continued at very weak
and very strong coupling to two new branches of gauge like theories, where not all the

stringy modes decouple from the dynamics. on one of these two branches the model can

be deformed continuously to a supersymmetric model. moreover, analogously to the bulk
theory one might expect a strong-weak duality for the non-supersymmetric u (n )  u (n )
gauge theory for nite gauge coupling. in the large n limit this might really be true, as

the theory is conformal and the gauge coupling is a free parameter.

4.3. m5-branes

the solitonic solution dual to the membranes in 11-dimensional supergravity are given

by the m-theory 5-branes (m5-branes). we will consider 2n m5-branes which are wrapped
around both directions of the compact space s1  s1/(1)fss. hence from the string

17

point of view we are in the momentum picture. therefore in nine dimensions the m5-

branes correspond to 2n d3-branes. these 2n m5-branes are intersected by m2-branes

which correspond to the open string sector in string theory. in complete analogy to the

unwrapped case, in the three type iib (0b) limits one obtains the following spectra.

a) r9 = a  0 (a > 0), r10 = b  0 (b > 0): we obtain n self-dual d3 plus d3-branes
of nitely coupled type 0b. now we have non-supersymmetric u (n ) u (n ) gauge theory
with the usual matter content.

b) r9 = a  0 (a > 0), r10 = b  const. or  (b  0): here we are dealing with
the strongly coupled type iib. after t-duality in the x9 direction the 2n m5-branes can
be viewed as 2n d3-branes with open strings ending on them. the corresponding gauge
theory in the momentum picture is given by four-dimensional, n = 4 supersymmetric
u (2n ) gauge theory at very strong yang-mill gauge coupling. however, not all d1-stringy
modes decouple and one does again get n = 4 msym with gauge group u (2n ).
c) r9 = a  const. or  (a  0), r10 = b  0 (b > 0):

now one is dealing with n d3 plus n d3-branes of weakly coupled type 0b string
theory. the corresponding gauge theory is weakly coupled n = 0 mym with gauge group
u (n )  u (n ).

in the m5-brane scenario we get two new branches at very small and very large
coupling, on which the supersymmetric u (2n ) and the non-supersymmetric u (n ) u (n )
gauge theory do still couple to some stringy modes.

5. conclusions

in this paper we have shown that d-branes in freely acting orbifolds of type ii and type
0 string constructions allow for a continuous interpolation between n = 4 supersymmetric
gauge theories with g = u (n ) or g = u (2n ) gauge symmetry and a non-supersymmetric
gauge theory with gauge group g = u (n )  u (n ), 6 adjoint scalars in each gauge group
factor plus 4 weyl fermions in the representations (n, n ) + (n, n ). the interpolation

mechanism is of stringy nature and can be realized varying the radii of the compact orbifold

space. therefore the coupling of the open string degrees of freedom to the modes of the

closed string compactication are crucial for the understanding of this mechanism.

we have also discussed how this scenario can be lifted to m-theory. as a result of

this discussion a non-supersymmetric gauge theory at weak coupling can be continuously

18

connected to a supersymmetric gauge theory like branch at strong coupling. another

conclusion from this investigation was that the non-supersymmetric gauge theory itself

might have a strong-weak coupling duality. let us emphasize, that duality conjectures for

non-supersymmetric models are on less solid ground as compared to the supersymmetric

case. therefore, the m-theory results should be considered with some care.

it is clear that the discussion in this paper can be straightforwardly generalized putting

branes on transversal singularities or discussing hanany-witten type of brane construc-

tions. consider for example the case of d3-branes probing a transversal, non-compact

zzk orbifold. via t-duality this is equivalent to k ns 5-branes intersected by d4-branes
[57,58]. for the type ii case, supersymmetry is broken to n = 2 and the gauge group is
now given by g = u (n )k . in the corresponding type 0 string the same construction leads
to a non-supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group [u (n )  u (n )]k plus certain
matter elds. again the large n -function is the same as in the n = 2, type ii parent
model. as before the freely acting orbifold construction implies that one can interpolate
between these two n = 2 and n = 0 gauge theories. for orbifolds or conifolds which
break the amount of supersymmetry on the brane down to n = 1, an interpolating model
can be build in an analogous way.
