abstract

we nd the spectrum p ()d of the gravitational wave background pro-
duced in the early universe in string theory. we work in the framework of
the recently discussed string driven cosmology, whose scale factors are com-
puted with the low-energy eective string equations as well as selfconsistent
solutions of general relativity with a gas of strings as source. the scale fac-
tor evolution is described by an early string driven inationary stage with an
instantaneous transition to a radiation dominated stage and successive mat-
ter dominated stage. this is a string cosmology expanding evolution always
running on positive proper cosmic time.

the spectrum of the generated gravitons is computed in the framework
of quantum field theory and in the appropiated eective string cosmology
context. we study and show explicitly the eect of the dilaton eld, charac-
teristic to this kind of cosmologies. we compute the spectrum for the same
evolution description with three dierents approachs. some features of grav-
itational wave spectra, as peaks and asymptotic behaviours, are found direct
consequences of the dilaton involved in the string low energy eective action
and not only of the scale factor evolution.

we make use of a careful treatment of the scale factor evolution and in-
volved transitions. this allows us to compute a full prediction on the power
spectrum of gravitational waves without any free-parameters. a comparative
analysis of dierent treatments, solutions and compatibility with observational
bounds or detection perspectives is made.

1 introduction and results

in the latest years, an impressive scientic eort has been made on the subject
of production of relic gravitational waves. the spectrum of relic gravitational waves
constitutes an important source of information about the conditions and dynamics of
the early universe. from the pioneering works relating the very early universe with
the spectrum of metric uctuations ([1],[2],[3]) a lot of work has followed computing
the gravitational waves background in dierent evolution models (see for instance
[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9]). the relic gravitational wave background is generated as a con-
sequence of the amplication by the universe expansion of the graviton elds, which
decouples from matter at very early stages. therefore, their spectrum is dened by
conditions in the very early epoch and remains practically unaected until our days,
since the medium is transparent to their propagation.

in addition, important improvements on the projects for direct detection of
gravitational waves, as well as on the measurements of astrophysical phenomena af-
fected by them have been performed or are expected for the next decade. this will
make possible to extract constraints and to put upper limits on the magnitude of the
generation and amplication of gravitational waves and thereafter, on the particu-
lar model of evolution considered for the universe. currently, the search of direct
measurements by means of resonant bar detectors (e.g., nautilus, auriga) has
been followed by the development of laser interferometers (ligo, lisa). the sensi-
tivities to be reached for the next generation of laser interferometers detectors could
x these constraints on ranges still more interesting from the point of view of early
universe theories ([10]). indirect constraints can be obtained from the closure re-
lation, nucleosynthesis bound, pulsar timing measurements and isotropy of cosmic
microwave background radiation (cmb) ([11]). finally, there would be imprints
on the cmb temperature anisotropy spectrum through sachs-wolfe eect ([12])
and polarization uctuations originated by scattering thompson on a tensorially
perturbed metric ([13]).

this study is particularly interesting from the point of view of string theory in
cosmology since gravitational waves are one of the observable tracks to be extracted
from the fundamental theory. the decoupling of gravitons from another kind of
matter has taken place very close to the planck energy scale. thus, the shape of the
spectrum could carry information about the physics on such energy and lenght scales.
a number of studies computing gravitational wave production in the context of string
cosmology scenarii has been made in the last years. ([14],[15],[16],[17]). oughted
to the intrinsic uncertainty in the cosmological model, the spectra computed in
these works depend on free parameters coming from the earliest stages of universe,
far from observational knowledge. no rm free-parameter prediction is extracted,
although the existence of a peak and end-point in the string cosmology gravitational
wave background has been claimed ([18]).

2

in this paper, we study the production of a primordial stochastic gravita-
tional wave background generated in the context of selfconsistent string cosmology
([19],[20],[21],[22]). from both treatments therein explained, low energy eective
string action and selfconsistent solutions of general relativity plus string matter, we
have obtained a minimal model for the evolution of the scale factor [23]. the string
driven cosmological background is characterized by an inationary inverse power
stage ai(t)  (ti  t) 2
d+1 and
a matter dominated stage aiii(t)  t
d . the cosmological model is linked to the uni-
verse observational information by means of descriptive temporal variables as per-
formed in [24] and [23]. our results are thus expressed in terms of standard times for
ination-radiation dominated transition tr, and radiation dominated-matter domi-
nated transition tm. the conformal time variable  has been dened with totally
satisfactory continuity conditions in the transitions.

we compute exact expressions for the power spectrum p ()d and contribu-
tion to the energy density gw of primordial gravitational waves generated in the
transition among the inationary and radiation dominated stages. these expres-
sions are fully predictive and free-parameter, since the cosmological model has been
constrainted with minimal and well stablished observational universe information
(the transition times tr and tm). having xed a minimal but satisfactory model
for the scale factor, we study the production of gravitational waves by making three
approaches in the perturbation treatment.

the role of the dilaton, a characteristic eld in low energy eective string theory
and present in our model, is proved to be crucial since gives a strong signature on the
shape and magnitude of these spectra. the computations of graviton perturbations
with no dilaton role are showed to be equivalent to standard quantum field theory
computations, like those reported in allen [4] and grishchuk [5], but notorious dier-
ences are found in the spectra oughted to the particular character of the inationary
string driven scale factor, an inverse power type. we obtain an exact expression for
the power spectrum and energy density contribution (eqs.(5.38) and (5.45)) in terms
of hankel functions. the power spectrum asymptotic behaviours at low and high
3 and 1 respectively. this gives
frequencies are both vanishing with dependences 
a gravitational wave contribution to the energy density asymptotically constant at
high frequencies on gw  1026. the slope change produces a peak in the power
spectra around a characteristic frequency totally determined by the model of value
x  1.48 mhz.

1

computations with partial dilaton role, considering this in the perturbation
equation but not on the perturbation itself, show some dierences with the last
ones, althought the general characteristics are very similar. the formal expressions
for the power spectrum and energy density contribution are the same of the no
dilaton case (eqs.(5.38) and (5.45)), but they involve hankel functions with dierent
orders. both asymptotic regimes for small and high frequencies vanish again, but

3 and 1 respectively. the peak appears around the same
now with dependences 
characteristic frequency, but its value is one order of magnitude lower than in the no
dilaton case, as well as the asymptotic constant contribution to the energy density
gw .

for low frequencies, the dependence is vanishing again with 

in the opposite case, when the full dilaton role is accounted, general characteris-
tics as well as orders of magnitude of the graviton spectrum are drastically modied.
the formal expressions are dierent (eqs.(5.83),(5.84)). we extract the asymptotic

behaviours too:
for high frequencies, an asymptotic divergent behaviour proportional to  is found.
similarly, the contribution to the critical energy density in gravitational waves is
divergent at high frequencies, as 2. the change of slope is less visible and no clear
peaks are found. the transition from the low frequency to the high frequency regime
is slower than in the previous cases (with no dilaton or partial dilaton roles) and
full analytical expressions are needed on a wider range 106  109hz. comparaison
of these summarized results can be found in tables (3), (4) and (5) and in figures
(1) and (2).

the behaviour obtained in the full dilaton treatment is a common characteristic
to the string cosmology low energy eective treatments. we conclude that the
brans-dicke frame (dilaton eld) involved and the type of scale factor predicted
(inverse power type) are responsible of these features. more conclusions (the dilaton
role, string and no-string cosmologies) are given in section vii.

in section ii, we recall the derivation of the background solutions obtained
in string cosmology, the richness of string theory applied to cosmology is visible
along this section.
in section iii we summarize the string driven cosmological
background in order to obtain an approximative but suitable description of the cos-
mology of our observational universe. we translate this description to a conformal
time-type variable more convenient for further work. section iv shows the compu-
tation of gravitational wave production in the framework of quantum field theory
and shows how the dilaton role can be considered. in section v we particularize to
our cosmological description and obtain exact expressions in suitable measurement
units both for power spectrum and energy density in each one of the three treat-
ments. in section vi we analyze the asymptotic behaviours. finally, we elaborate
and discuss our results and compare to other string cosmology computations as
well as to pure general relativity gravitational wave computations, and present our
conclusions in section vii.

2 string driven cosmological background

the string driven cosmological background is a minimal model of the universe
evolution totally extracted from eective string theory. details on the model can
be found in ref.[23], but here we summarize it. two ways allowing extraction of
cosmological descriptions for the background from string theory have been used. one
is the low energy eective string equations plus string action matter. solutions of
these equations are an inationary inverse power law evolution of the scale factor, as
well as a radiation dominated behaviour. on the other hand, selfconsistent einstein
equations with a classical gas of strings as sources will give us again a radiation
dominated behaviour and a matter dominated description.

in this whole and next sections, unless opposite indication, the metric is dened
in lenght units. thus, the (0,0) component is always time coordinate t multiplied by
constant c, that means t = ct . derivatives are taken with respect to this coordinate
t. otherwise, constants c, h and g are explicitly showed. we consider a spatially
at, homogeneous and isotropic background and we write the metric in synchronous
frame (g00 = 1, g0i = 0 = g0a) as:

g = diag(1,a2(t) ij)

(2.1)

the earliest stages in our model are provided by the low energy eective context.
the scale factor is extracted by extremizing with respect to dilaton eld, graviton
eld and matter sources the low energy string eective action (to the lowest order in
expansion of powers of ), which in the brans-dicke or string frame can be written
as [25],[19],[14],[21]:

s = 

c3

16gd z dd+1xq| g |e r +  

h 2
12

+ v! + sm

(2.2)

where sm is the corresponding action for the strings as matter sources, h = db is
the antisymmetric tensor eld strenght and v is related with dilaton potential and
vanishing for some critical dimension. the dilaton eld  depends explicitly only
upon time coordinate. d is the total spacetime dimension, d = d + 1 where d is the
number of spatial dimensions. the string matter is included as a classical source
which stress energy tensor in the perfect uid approximation takes the form:

t

 = diag((t),p (t)i

j)

(2.3)

where  is the energy density and p the pressure for the matter sources. here, we
will consider antisymmetric tensor h as well as the potential b vanishing. we
do not consider here the eects oughted to a non-vanishing dilaton potential. thus,
the low energy eective equations are obtained:

where h = a

a and we use the shifted string duality invariant expressions for the

dilaton  =   lnq| g |, matter energy density  = ad and pressure p = p ad.

the inationary string driven stage appears as a new selfconsistent solution of
the low energy eective equations (2.4) sustained by a gas of stretched or unstable
string sources ([19],[20]). the pressure and energy density of this string behaviour
in curved background satisfy the equation of state p =  as matter sources, where
d  = 1 for the unstable behaviour in the metric here considered. thus, the
equation of state to be considered for the string sources is given by:

with this, the selfconsistent solution of eective equations (2.4) is:

p = 

1
d



a(t) = ai(ti  t)q
(t) = i + 2d ln a(t)
(t) = i(a(t))(1d)

(2.5)

(2.6)

notice here t is the proper cosmic time coordinate, running on positive values; d is
the number of expanding spatial dimensions; i, i are integration constants and
ai, ti parameters to be xed by the further evolution of scale factor, the parameter
ti being greater than the exit of the inationary stage tr.

it is convenient for further work to express the solutions in conformal time 

such d = dt

,

q =

d + 3

(2.7)

where i is a parameter to be determined in the matching with the next cosmological
stage.

as discussed in ref.[23], this is a new string cosmology solution, obtained with-
out exploting manifestly duality relations among the solutions, and describing an

6

accelerated expansion running on the positive branch of cosmic temporal coordi-
nate. in this way, this solution is dierent to the pre-big bang solutions found in
literature [14].

on the other hand, the dual to unstable string behaviour in curved backgrounds
follows a typical radiation type equation of state p = 1
d  [19]. the eective equa-
tions (2.4) plus this equation of state give the following behaviour describing a
radiation dominated stage [19], [14]:

a(t) = aii tr

tr < t

r =

(2.8)

(t) = ii
(t) = ii(a(t))(1+d)

p (t) =

1
d

(t) =

ii
d

(a(t))(1+d)

here ii, ii are integration constants, and aii a parameter to be xed by the
evolution of scale factor. notice the dilaton remains frozen at constant value.
again, we dene the corresponding conformal time to this stage. the solution takes
the form:

arad()  (  ii)r
rad() = ii

,

r =

2
d  1

(2.9)

where ii, ii are constants to be determined with the scale factor evolution.

cosmological backgrounds can be found too, as selfconsistent solutions of the
general relativity einstein equations selfsustained by the string sources evolving
in them, as developped in [19],[20],[21]. in the curved backgrounds here considered,
the einstein equations take the form:

1
2

d(d  1)h 2 = 
(d  1) h + p +  = 0

(2.10)

and the matter source is described by a gas of non interacting classical strings,
whose equation of state includes the dierent possible behaviours of strings in curved
spacetimes: unstable, dual to unstable and stable, each one with string densities u,
d and s respectively. taking into account the properties of each behaviour (see
[19]), the energy density and the pressure of the string gas are described by:

(a(t))d   d

+ s!
a(t)  u a(t)!

(2.11)

(2.12)

equations (2.11) and (2.12) are qualitatively corrects for every t and become exacts
in the asymptotic regimes, leading to obtain the radiation dominated behaviour of
the scale factor, as well as the matter dominated behaviour. the rst one is obtained
in the limit a(t)  0 and t  0, where the dual to unstable behaviour dominates in
the equations (2.11) and (2.12) and gives us:

(t)  d (a(t))(d+1)
p (t) 

1
d d (a(t))(d+1)

(2.13)

solving the einstein equations (2.10) with sources following eqs.(2.13), yields the
scale factor solution:

d+1  d + 1

(t  tii)r

, r =

d + 1

(2.14)

a(t) describes the evolution of a frw radiation dominated stage, here the parameter
tii will be xed by the further evolution of the scale factor. this is coherent with
the fact that dual to unstable strings behave in a similar way to massless particles,
i.e. radiation [19]. in conformal time and rearranging constants, this solution reads:

arad() = ii(  ii)r

,

r =

2
d  1

notice that the scale factor now described is equivalent to the before obtained in
low energy eective treatment, eq.(2.9).

in the opposite limit a(t)  , t  , the unstable density u  0 and the

stable behaviour s becomes dominant. the equation of state reduces to:

  s (a(t))d
p = 0

(2.15)

and from solving eqs.(2.10) with eqs.(2.15), the solution of a matter dominated stage
emerges (notice that stable strings behave as cold matter):

here tiii is xed by the whole scale factor evolution. this scale factor in conformal
time takes the form:

amat() = iii(  iii)m , m =

2

(2.17)

here the constants iii and iii will be determined from the transition between
radiation and matter dominated stages.

the evolution model with the string driven inationary stage eq.(2.6), followed
by a radiation dominated stage (eqs.(2.8) or (2.14) are equivalents for our purposes)
and a matter dominated stage eq.(2.16) is the string driven cosmological back-
ground that we will study.

notice that we consider the dilaton eld remaining practically constant and
vanishing from the exit of ination, as suggested in the string driven radiation
dominated solution, until the current time. notice also the brans-dicke frame for
the metric-dilaton coupling where the string action has been written eq.(2.2) and
both an inationary and a radiation dominated stages have been extracted. the
last one can be obtained too selfconsistently from the einstein equations plus string
matter, the same treatment where the matter dominated current stage is obtained
too. in the table (1) the scale factor, dilaton and equation of state obtained from
these treatments can be observed in a comparative way.

3 scale factor description

since the behaviours above extracted are asymptotic results, it is not possible
to give here the detail of transitions among the dierent stages. it would be ex-
pected some changes in the regimes or equations governing each stage and leading
to the next one, but this is an open question in the framework of string theory both
for ination-radiation dominated as well as radiation dominated-matter dominated

9

transition. taking the simplest option, we consider the real scale factor evolution
minimally described as:

ai(t) = ai(ti  t)q
aii(t) = aii tr
aiii(t) = aiii tm

t  (ti, tr)
t  (tr, tm)
t  (tm, t0)

(3.1)

with transitions at least not excessively long at tr beginning of radiation dominated
stage and tm beginning of matter dominated stage. we dene also a beginning of
ination at ti and a current time t0.

from the point of view of string theory applied to cosmology, it would be
reasonable to have not instantaneous and continuous transitions at tr and tm [23].
but this condition greatly dicults the computation that we want make because
it introduces free parameters, loss of physical meaning and eects of an unknown
transition dynamics [4] oughted to discontinuity on the scale factor.
in order to
construct a suitable minimal model for gravitational wave computations, we will
merge our lack of knowledge on real transitions by means of descriptive temporal
variables in function of which the modelized transitions at t1 and t2 are instantaneous
and continuous.

we link this descriptive scale factor with the minimal information about the
observational universe. we consider the standard values for cosmological times: the
radiation-matter transition held about tm  1012s, the beginning of radiation stage
1  1017s (the exact
at tr  1032s and the current age of the universe t0  h0
numerical value of t0 turns out not crucial here). we impose also to our description
to satisfy the same scale factor expansion (or scale factor ratii) reached in each one
of the three stages considered in the real model (3.1). explicit computations can
be found in [24] and leds nally to this scale factor written in cosmic time-type
variables in the more convenient way for our further work:

q

ai(t) = ai( ti  t)
aii(t) = aii(t  tii)r
aiii(t) = aiii(t)m

ti < t < t1
t1 < t < t2

t2 < t < t0

(3.2)

with continuous transitions at t1 and t2 for both the scale factor and rst derivatives
with respect to the descriptive cosmic time-type variables t, t and t. in terms of the
standard observational times tr and tm, the transitions t1, t2 and the beginning of
the inationary stage description ti are expressed as:

t1 =

r

ti = (cid:18) r

(3.3)

10

and the set of parameters of the scale factor (3.2) can be written too in terms of tr,
tm and the global scale factor aii:

+

m

ti = tr(cid:18) r
ai = aii(cid:18) q

(3.4)

notice that the intermediate descriptive scale factor could not be physical, but
this is not important under the purposes here. since the description is linked with ob-
servational information and it satises the proper scale factor ratii, our computation
will be equivalent to that made on a full and physical model. these are equivalents
unless the features left on gravitational wave production by the details of an in any
case unknown dynamics of transition and minimized through their modelization in
satisfactory continuos way, as made here. the time variables t of inationary stage,
and t of radiation stage are not a priori exactly equal to the physical time coordinate
at rest frame (multiplied by c), but transformations (dilatation plus translation) of
it. the low energy eective action equations from where the scale factor, dilaton
and equation of state have been extracted, allows this transformations. with this
treatment of cosmological scale factor, we will attain computations free of by hand
parameters, and with full predictibility as can be seen in the next sections.

it is also useful to express this model in conformal time variables , dened
a(t) . we will have a conformal time variable for each stage (,  and )
as d = dt
oughted to the dierent scale factor shape and dierent descriptive temporal variable
on which we integrate. in this way, the conformal time variable constructed enjoys
continuity on their derivatives along the transitions at t1 and t2 [24].

we can impose also continuity conditions in order to have a conformal time uniquely
dened at transitions. 1 = ( t1)  ( t1) and 2 = ( t2)  ( t2) (in this respect,
dierent ways can be found in literature, see [24]). we use the remaining freedom in
put a simplicity condition, asking a simple conformal time dependence in radiation
dominated stage.
it yields the next expressions for the scale factor in conformal
time:

ai() = i(i  )q
aii() = ii()r
aiii() = iii(iii + )m

i <  < 1
1 <  < 2
2 < 

(3.5)

with continuous and suddenly transitions (continuity of scale factor and rst deriva-
tive with respect to conformal time) at 1 and 2. the six parameters satisfy these

meanwhile, the conformal time transitions 1, 2 and i have the expressions:

finally, it is useful for further work to compute here the value for the conformal
time and scale factor at current time 0. if we dene t0 = ct0 and from eqs.(3.9), it
is easily seen:

the scale factor written in conformal time for current time takes the form aiii(0) =
iii(iii + 0)m. from eqs.(3.7) and (3.10) we translate this value to observational
transition values:

aiii(0) = aii(cid:18) r

the last point is to make an approach for the dilaton eld. this is considered
practically constant from the beginning of radiation dominated stage until the cur-
rent time. their value can be supposed coincident with the value at exit ination
time in a sudden but not continuous transition for the dilaton, since no one of their
temporal derivatives can match this asymptotic behaviours.

remember the expression for dilaton in ination dominated stage, that gives

4 generation of gravitational wave perturbations

in string cosmology

after obtaining the minimal cosmological model for the scale factor in the
framework of string cosmology, we will compute one of its important observational
consequences, the stochastic background of relic gravitational waves. as rst noticed
by grishchuk [6], relic gravitational waves are inevitably generated in practically all
cosmological models oughted to their variable gravitational eld.

the generation of gravitational wave backgrounds can be studied classically
as propagation and amplication by the expanding background of one initial spec-
trum of tensorial perturbations on the metric. from the quantum mechanical point
of view, a particle production mechanism occurs and gravitational waves of every
wavelenght are generated as gravitons from an initial vacuum state. this translates
into a combined classical-quantum mechanical formalism. (see for instance [7] and
[26]). gravitons produced at scales near the planck time must exist today in the
form of gravitational waves of wavelenghts to be determined by the propagation
equation. [1].

the number or particles produced between an initial -asymptotic- vacuum state
and a nal state, where particles -gravitons- has been created by the eect of the
changing gravitational eld can be obtained by computing the bogoliubov coe-
cients [4]. grishchuk [6] has a similar approach modelizing the changing gravita-
tional eld as a potential barrier. each polarization degree of freedom of tensorial
perturbation satises the same propagation equation that a massless scalar eld
([3],[5],[9]). but in frameworks with a dilaton eld, attention must be put in ac-
counting for the dilaton contribution to the gravitational eld change and to the
metric perturbation, breaking the validity of reported treatments [15].

in the next, we summarize and follow the treatment of tensorial perturbations
in cosmological backgrounds within the brans-dicke frame developped in ref.[15].
that is necessary for accounting of the full eect of the dilaton eld and for the
consistency with the framework in which the string cosmology solutions have been
obtained. we will show that this formalism includes as a particular case (no dilaton
eld) the formalism developped by allen [4] and grishchuk [6] in the framework of
quantum eld theory.

the general action written in brans-dicke frame takes the form:

s = 

c3

16gd z dd+1xq| g |e (r   g   ) + sm

(4.1)

where sm represents the contribution of matter sources such that its stress tensor
g , antisymmetric tensors and dilaton potential are vanishing and

is q| g |t = 2 sm

14

 is the usual brans-dicke parameter. for  =  general relativity expressions
are found and for  = 1 this action coincides with the low energy eective string
action eq.(2.2). by varying with respect to the metric g and to dilaton  the
following two equations are obtained:

r

 +  + ( + 1)[

(()2  )  ] =
r + ()2  2  = 0

8gd

c4

et



(4.2)

(4.3)
where  =  is the covariant dalambertian operator. again, the case
 = 1 recoveres the low energy string eective equations (2.4).

the free-linearized wave equation for a generic metric uctuation h = g is
obtained by expressing the perturbed metric as g = g + g, and all the sources
 =  = 0, second order (and higher) terms in h are
are considered xed t
neglected.

in the following, the study is made only for the tensorial component of the
metric uctuation h. the general case for the metric is considered: an anisotropic
background, with d expanding external spatial dimensions with scale factor a(t) and
n contracting internal dimensions with scale factor b(t), both at and euclidean.
expressed in the synchronous gauge, the metric is:

g = (1,a2(t)ij(x),b2(t)ab(y))

(4.4)

where again the component (0,0) is written in lenght units and corresponds to the
variable t = ct , indexes i, j run from (1 . . . d) and indexes a, b run from (d + 1 . . . d +
n + 1).

the metric perturbation is considered propagating only in the external spatial

dimensions, decoupled from the sources and purely tensorial:

h = h(x, t)
h0 = ha = 0

(4.5)
(4.6)

that means, a pure gravitational wave that can be expressed in the transverse-
 = 0. with these conditions, eq.(4.3) is
traceless gauge, thus g h = 0 and h
trivially satised and from (4.2) the free-linearized wave equation for the tensorial
metric perturbation h is obtained:

r

 +

1
2

 h g  h = 0

(4.7)

it must be noticed that this equation is -independent and therefore it is valid in
general for all brans-dicke cases and in particular for the low energy eective string
action. eq.(4.7) takes a shorter form when the whole information about the metric
is introduced [15].

(4.10)

j is identied with each one of the two polarization modes of
in such a way that i

mode  satises the corresponding equation written in conformal time:

(4.12)

thus, the problem of metric uctuation propagation is reduced to a second
order dierential schrodinger type equation, where the potential v () takes into
account the conformal time derivatives of the background as well as those of dilaton
elds; that means, the whole variable gravitational eld pumping the generation
and amplication of gravitons.[15]

following our denition of the variable t = ct in length units, the confor-
mal time variable  has also length units. thus, the potential (4.12) have units
(length)(2) and the wavenumber k has units (length)(1).

as it was pointed out in [15], this treatment generalizes to higher dimensional
backgrounds the treatment more widely work, usually based on the pioneering works
of grishchuck [1], [5]. it generalizes also other early works like those of allen [4].

4.1 particular cases

string driven case

in order to compute perturbations in our cosmological background, we will
consider the suitable particularization of eqs.(4.11) and (4.12). for arbitrary d and
n = 0 eqs.(4.11) and (4.12) take the form:





v () =

the perturbation variable  is written as:

i

j = hi

ja

d1

2 e 

2

,

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

and as consequence, 

0 = 0

 = 0. equivalently, the tensorial perturbation is:


2

ja d+3
hij = i
2 e
h0  = h 0 = 0
ha  = h a = 0

(4.16)

where the index  runs now from 1 . . . d.

no dilaton case

it is possible to extract from eqs.(4.13), (4.14) and (4.15) the case without

dilaton eld, in which we obtain the set of equations:





+ (k2  v ()) = 0
1
4

2   a
d  1

a ! +



v () =

(d  1)(d  3) a



the perturbation variable  is:

j a d+3
hi j = i
h0  = h 0 = 0

2

17

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

the case of three spatial dimensions gives the simplest expressions:





+ (k2  v ()) = 0



a !
v () =   a

where the perturbation is simply written

i

j = a hi

j

(4.20)

(4.21)

(4.22)

j a3 and h0  = h 0 = 0. this particular (3+1)-dimensional
with hi j = i
case gives the same set of equations ((4.20)-(4.22)) that can be found in grischuhck
treatments [5]. these equations can be also identied with the formalism found in
[4].

for the sake of completeness, we compare now with the linearized einstein
equations for an homogeneus, isotropic and spatially at metric g which in the
conformal time gauge is:

ds2 = a()2(d2 + dx2)

(4.23)

a gravitational perturbation h = a2()f of comoving wave number k is

overimposed such that:

g = a2()( + f)

(4.24)

by performing a fourier expansion, f can be described as:

f(, x) = ()e(k) exp(kx)

(4.25)

where e is the constant polarization vector. it can be shown that the amplitude
perturbation satises the equation [4]:

() + (d  1)

a()
a()

() + k2 = 0

(4.26)

where k =| k |, k is the comoving wave number and prime stands for conformal
temporal derivatives. this equation is equivalent to eq.(4.9) in the brans-dicke
formalism, provided particularization to isotropic cases (f = 0) and no dilaton
dynamics (  = 0). for d = 3, eq.(4.26) is the known equation found in the literature
([4]).

let us write:

then, we have

() = a()( d1

2 )v()

.

u() +


2 
d  1


a()!2
2   a()
3  d



18

 + k2

u() = 0

(4.27)

that, in the particular three spatial dimensions take the form:

() =

u()
a()

a()
a()

v()

v() = 
u() + (k2  v ())u() = 0

v () =

a()
a()

this shows the equivalence with the grishchuk formalism and with the (3+1)-
dimensional particularization of the no dilaton case showed above.

4.2 the power spectrum

we perform an expansion of the vacuum state (amplitude of perturbations at
the classical level) in positive- and negative- frequency modes in each stage. the
bogoliubov coecients mix the modes before and after the transition or the graviton
+. | k |2 gives the number of particles of
creation-annihilation operators ak and ak
comoving frequency k generated on the vacuum state. this is the initial state
(at a time suciently early before the transition to radiation dominated stage), so
the corresponding bogoliubov coecient in the radiation dominated stage yields the
total number of particles created during the whole inationary era with respect that
initial state.

we will determine the bogoliubov coecients (k) and (k) for every wavenum-
ber perturbation k by considering a continous matching of the perturbation ampli-
tude at the transition time 1 between ination and radiation dominated stages.
thus, we will impose continuity of the amplitude perturbation -treated as quantum
state- as well as of its rst conformal time derivative at the sudden transition at
conformal time 1. this is similar to work with the picture of a potential barrier
generated by the variable gravitational eld [5]. gravitational waves would inter-
act with this barrier. by describing one state out the barrier, one state in
with frozen amplitude and a comeback to out, the bogoliubov coecients can be
computed. but as above said, the contribution of the dilaton change can be missed.

the stochastic background of gravitational waves generated in the cosmological
transitions is described by the power spectrum p ()d, which is the energy density
contained in gravitational waves with frequencies in the interval between  and
 + d;  is the proper frequency at the detection time related to the comoving
wavenumber k through:

 =

c k
a(0)

19

(4.28)

the total energy density in gravitational waves is computed as gw = r p ()d
[4]. the power spectrum p ()d is given by p ()d = 2h|  |2ddn where dn is
the density of states, which in three spatial dimensions (as we have at the detection
22c3 d; |  |2 is the number of gravitons created in each frequency
moment) is dn = 2
interval and each polarization state. this comes multiplied by the two polarization
degrees of freedom of the tensorial metric perturbation and by the energy h of each
one:

p ()d =

h3
2c3|  |2d

(4.29)

thus, the power spectrum p () has dimensions [p ()] = energy time

volume =

mass

time lenght .

it is usual to write the power spectrum as fraction of the critical energy density

by octave, which is the closest form to gravitational wave detection procedures:

gw =

1
c

dgw ()

d ln 

here gw is the energy density contained in gravitational waves and c is the critical
energy density c = 3 h0

8g . this is equivalent to compute

2

gw =


c

p ()

(4.30)

obviously, gw is dimensionless [gw ] = 1.

5 power spectrum in string driven cosmology

5.1 no dilaton case

we begin our computations of power spectrum of gravitational waves with the
simplest case: we will neglect in this the whole dilaton role. thus, we will solve
eqs.(4.17), (4.18) and the reduced amplitud perturbation given by (4.19).

in the inationary stage, from eqs.(3.5) and (4.18), the potential v () is given

by:

v () =

(5.1)

the general solution of eq.(4.17) with the potential (5.1) is given in terms of bessel

(1)(k(i  )) + c2h

(2)(k(i  ))(cid:17)

(5.2)

with index :

 =

2

((d  1)q + 1)

or, from eq.(2.7) in terms of the number d of the spatial dimensions.

 =

3d + 1
2(d + 3)

it gives  = 5

6 for three spatial dimensions.

(5.3)

(5.4)

the coecients c1 and c2 are xed by the choice of initial or boundary condi-
tions, i.e. by the inationary vacuum state [4]. thus, the asymptotic expression of
(5.2) for early times should contain only positive frequency modes.

the argument of the hankel functions involved can be expressed in terms of

the cosmic time. from eq.(3.6):

z  k(i  ) = k(cid:18)1(1 +

q
r

)  (cid:19) ,

(5.5)

and with the expressions relating the conformal time description with the observa-
tional transition times and cosmic time eqs.(3.7), (3.8) and (3.9), we get:

z = k (cid:18) r

m

1r

tr(cid:19)

q

r(q + 1)

1

aii"(cid:18) ti  t

ti  tr(cid:19)q+1#

(5.6)

as discussed in section ii (see eq.(2.6) and comments below), the parameter ti is
always greater than the exit of inationary stage tr, thus the argument z is real and
z > 0 for all t < tr. for time very early in the inationary stage t  ti and t << tr,
the argument z approaches its maximum value. thus, we must identify the large
argument regime with the vacuum state at enough early inationary stage (usually
refered as well below the transition to radiation dominated epoch).

the asymptotic behaviours of hankel functions [27]: and the positive frequency
mode condition at early stages, x c2 = 0. the remaining freedom in the coecient
c1 is linked to the normalization of the vacuum inationary state and we include it
in the normalization coecient n . in this way, the reduced amplitude perturbation
in the inationary stage (before the transition) is written as:

i = n (i  )

1

2h

(1) (k(i  ))

(5.7)

in the radiation dominated stage, from the scale factor eq.(3.5), the potential

(4.18) takes the form:

v () = 


  d  1

2

r 

1

2!2



1

21

(5.8)

and the general solution of eq.(4.17), with eq.(5.8) is given again in terms of

hankel functions:

(1)(k ) + d2h

(2)(k )(cid:17) ,

((d  1)r  1)

.

since the radiation dominated stage has r = 2

d1 (eq.(2.9)), it makes:

 = 

1
2

(5.9)

(5.10)

(5.11)

in this case, by using the properties of hankel functions with fractional index (see
[27]) ,  eq.(5.9) has the expression:

 = is 2

k(cid:16)d1eik   d2eik (cid:17)

(5.12)

which can be written also in the way

ii = i ms 2

k(cid:16)eik(1) + eik(1)(cid:17)

.

(5.13)

here we have dened m a suitable normalization constant and the coecients
m e ik1 and  =  d1
m eik1 are the bogoliubovs coecients, since they are

 = d2
multiplying the positive- and negative-frequency pure modes.

with the expressions for the reduced amplitude perturbation in each stage (5.7)
and (5.13), where we remember the parameter  has the value given by (5.3), we will
determine the value of bogoliubovs coecients  and  by matching the reduced
amplitude perturbation and its rst conformal time derivative continuously across
the ination-radiation dominated transition value 1.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=1

can be expressed, following eq. (3.6)

(5.32)

this condition holds for all k, thus it ensure us the absence of isolated depen-
dence of k through the normalization constants. the dierence among them is only
a phase. the same result can be reached by computing explicitly the constants n
and m in the framework of a specic normalization scheme.

5.1.1 the power spectrum in physical units

now we are able to compute the power spectrum of the stochastic gravitational
wave background with full physical meaning. in terms of the proper frequency  at
detection time eq.(4.28), we read the variable x eq.(5.19) as:

x =  (cid:18) q

r(cid:19) a(0)1

c

24

(5.33)

notice that the dependence with the global scale factor parameter aii (the only
quantity unknown in these expressions), is cancelled in x by the product of 1a(0).
with the help of eqs.(3.8), (3.11), (3.7) and some rearrangements we have:

x   s

, s =

m

(q + 1)m(cid:18) t0

that is, we nd the argument x related to the physical proper frequency in
a way totally determined by the cosmological model studied, and linked to obser-
are exactly the scale factor expansion
reached during the radiation dominated and matter dominated epochs, respectively,
introduced as part of our linking to observational universe information on the min-
imal cosmological model. (see section iii). both values are strongly constrained by
the observational evolution data. meanwhile, the value tr (beginning of radiation
dominated stage) gives us the order of magnitude of the exit of inationary stage,
related to the order of magnitude of gut scales.

tr (cid:17)r
and (cid:16) tm

tm(cid:17)m

obviously, the quantity s has dimensions [s] = time. thus, as [] = rad (time)1,

x is dimensionless. we can give here the value of s for our cosmological scale fac-
tor. from string theory, we have obtained the scale factors with parameters of
temporal dependence q = 2
d for inationary, radiation
dominated and matter dominated stages, respectively (see eqs.(2.6), (2.8), (2.16)
and table(2)). by linking with the cosmological observational description, we have
considered the standard values for tr, tm and t0 given in previous section. this
leads to the expression

d+1 and m = 2

d+1 , r = 2

xstring =

for three spatial dimensions, and the time constants given in seconds, we have:

xstring =

(5.35)

if we dene a characteristic frequency x which makes unity the argument x
(x s = 1), the value of it would be

x  9.28 106 rad

s  1.48 mhz

(5.36)

now, we compute the full and exact expression of the power spectrum for the
stochastic background of gravitational waves produced in the ination-radiation
dominated transition. following the usual denition, the power spectrum of gravi-
tational waves computed in three spatial dimensions is:

p ()d =

h

2c3

3d|  |2

25

(5.37)

from eq.(5.30) and eq.(5.34), we have:

p ()d =

(5.38)

where s is given by eq.(5.34).

the expression in square brackets is dimensionless. all physical units are found
in the term multiplying it and proportional to 2d. for our scale factor in three
spatial dimensions, the coecient in front will take the value:

h

2(cid:17)2
8c3 (cid:16)  1

s

 1.603 1054 erg seg3

cm3

(5.39)

thus the power spectrum p ()d has dimensions of energy density.

notice the dependence of p () on the scale factor parameters through the
parameter , eq.(5.3), characterizing the expression of the power spectrum and its
 dependence. this is the way the cosmological theory considered is imprinted on
the gravitational wave spectrum. the parameter x eq.(5.34), is uniquely xed by
the scale factor and according with observational values. we will see in the next
sections as the dierent dilaton roles and the dierent theories, although involving
the same scale factor, led to dierent power spectra shapes.

it is also possible to express the power spectrum in terms of the bessel functions

j(z) and the neumann functions y(z) [28]:

with the wronskian[27]

(1)(z) = j(z) + iy(z)

(5.44)

eqs.(5.44) and (5.43) manifest explicitely the real character of the mathematical
expressions involved in the power spectrum. in fact, the imaginary terms belonging
to hankel functions cancel exactly among them and with the free imaginary term.
this is more easily seen looking in the last expression, where the power spectrum
is fully expressed in bessel functions (real functions when the argument is real)
(see [29]) from the numerical point of view, expressions (5.43) or (5.44) are more
convenient, since standard algorithms are limited in compute hankel functions to
very high precision at large arguments and it leds to wrong results in computing
the above expressions. expressions (5.43) and (5.44) allow extend 1-2 orders of
magnitude more the numerical computations of the exact spectrum. in any case, in
the next chapter we will overcome this limitation with analytical expressions for the
regime of small and large arguments.

finally, we compute the fraction of critical energy density in gravitational waves
by octave. following the denition eq.(4.30) and using the expression (5.38), we
have:

5.2 partial dilaton case

in this case, we will consider the role of the dilaton eld in the equations for
the reduced amplitude perturbation . we will see that this procedure still means a
partial consideration of the dilaton role on the gravitational wave spectra. by now,
we will solve eqs.(4.13) and (4.14) with the reduced amplitude perturbation given
by (4.15).

now, in the inationary stage, we take into account not only the scale factor
but also the dilaton eld. following eqs.(2.6) and (3.5) we have for the dilaton in
this stage:

() = i + 2d ln a()

(5.47)

thus, the potential eq.(4.14) takes now the form:

v () = 

 d + 1

2

1

2!2



q

 (i  )2

(5.48)

then, we have again an equation whose solution is expressed in terms of bessel

functions, but with the parameter  having the value:

 =   d + 1

q

or, expressed in terms of the spatial number dimensions,

that is,  = 1
eq.(5.49).

notice the dierence with the parameter  eq.(5.4) obtained in the no dilaton

case. the dierence among both cases is:

|part.dil. = |no dil. + (1  q)

it leds to a totally similar expression to eq.(5.7) for the solution of the reduced

amplitude perturbation:

i = n (i  )

1

2h

(1) (k(i  ))

(5.51)

where  is given now by eq.(5.49) and n is a normalization constant.

29

for the radiation dominated stage, the scale factor is given by eq.(3.5) and the
dilaton eld, according to eqs.(2.8), remains frozen in its constant value at the
exit ination time:

ii = ()| = 1

(5.52)

thus, we recover exactly the same expressions for the potential eq.(5.8), the
2 and consequently, the same expres-

general solution eq.(5.9), the parameter  =  1
sion in terms of bogoliubovs coecients  and :

ii = ims 2
with m a normalization constant.

k(cid:16)eik(1) + eik(1)(cid:17)

(5.53)

the bogoliubovs coecients computed now have exactly the same formal ex-
pressions yet obtained in the last section, eqs.(5.29) and (5.30), since the reduced
amplitude perturbations involved in the matching at the transition at 1 are for-
mally the same functions (5.7) and (5.13) in both cases. only the parameter  is
dierent, now given by eq.(5.49).

similarly, all the relations in order to compute the power spectrum eq.(5.38), the
fraction of critical energy density gw eq.(5.45) and the expression of the argument
x eq.(5.34) as function of the proper frequency , hold in this case. notice that the
argument x does not depend on the dilaton role; this quantity comes xed from
the evolution of the scale factor. thus, we have again p ()d and gw as given by
eqs.(5.38) and (5.45) but with the parameter  given in this case by eq.(5.49).

in three spatial dimensions, we have the same values for the parameter s
eq.(5.35) and for the characteristic frequency x eq.(5.36). the numerical values of
coecients multiplying the square brackets expressions in (5.38) and (5.45) would
be, in principle, dierents since they depend of the parameter . but in our case,
in three spatial dimensions, the value of (  1
2)2 is the same for both cases, giving
the same numerical value for these coecients too.

it must be observed that the normalization constants n and m are constrainted
by the normalization condition of bogoliubovs coecients to satisfy the same re-
lation found in the case before: n and m dier only in a phase. (see eqs.(5.32)).
but the case of particular and explicit normalization applicable to the no dilaton
case is not generalizable to the dilaton case. now, both constants will remain as
undetermined parameters in the amplitude perturbations.

30

5.3 the full dilaton role

in this section, we will take into account the full dilaton role. in the last section,
we have considered it through the reduced amplitude perturbation , solution of
eq.(4.13). but we have left unconsidered the dilaton role in the total amplitude
perturbation h. in order to include this, we will match in this case the metric
amplitude perturbation h instead of only the reduced amplitude perturbation .

in the framework of general relativity, as the treatment of grishchuk [5] and
allen [4], both procedures are equivalents, since the metric perturbation and the
reduced amplitude dier only through a power of the scale factor. in those cases, and
with a description with suitable properties of continuity for the scale factor and its
rst conformal time derivative like those we are dealing with, the nal result for the
gravitational wave spectra would be the same, since there are no lack of information
by matching only a part of the metric perturbation, the reduced amplitude. the
remaining part would give us redundant information.

but in the case of theories with dilaton elds, brans-dicke frames and in par-
ticular, string cosmology, the remaining part in the total amplitude perturbation
contains additional information with respect to the reduced one.
it contains an
added dependence on the dilaton eld, as can be seen from eq.(4.16). the be-
haviour of this part through the transition is not the same as the scale factor, since
there is no continuity in the rst derivative of the dilaton eld. thus, the power
spectra computed by matching only the reduced amplitude perturbations is dierent
from that obtained by matching the full metric perturbation.

in summary, the physical quantity to be studied is the full metric perturbation
amplitude. meanwhile, the reduced amplitude perturbation can be considered as a
sometimes convenient mathematical reduction of the problem.

in the inationary stage, we have the same equations for the reduced amplitude
perturbation (4.13) and (4.14) that in the precedent section. therefore, we will have
the same expression for the reduced amplitude perturbation:

i = n (i  )

the reduced  and the total tensorial metric perturbation are related by eq.(4.15).

instead of , we will match the metric perturbation amplitude :

 = a d1

2

31

(5.56)

such that the metric perturbation is written as:

h = e(k) (, k) eik.x

i = n i

2 e

2 (i  )q( d+1

(5.57)

(5.58)

in contrast to the precedent cases, we will take in the following the negative sign in
the parameter  (5.55):

 =   1

2  q

d + 1

2 !

because with this denition, we can write the amplitude perturbation as:

i = n i

d+1

2 e

i

2 (i  )h

(1) (k(i  ))

(5.59)

(5.60)

where n is a normalization constant.notice the parameter  in the conformal time
dependence.

on the other hand, in the radiation dominated stage, the reduced amplitude
perturbation is obtained in a totally equivalent way to the precedent section. we
recover for this reduced amplitude eq.(5.53):

ii = ims 2

k(cid:16)eik(1) + eik(1)(cid:17)

(5.61)

since we have again the parameter  =  1

the tensorial metric perturbation h is given by eq.(5.57) with the amplitude

 given by:

ii = ims 2

in the tables (3) and (4), we show the dierent power spectra and fraction of
critical energy density for a single cosmological scale factor, but in the three dierent
roles for the dilaton. as can be seen, there is a notorious dierence between the
three dierent treatments of the dilaton role for a single cosmological scale factor
description. first, the parameter , characterizing the inationary expansion and
the power spectrum, is dierent in each case. the sign of this parameter is only
ensured in the full dilaton treatment, by relating it with the form of the metric am-
plitude perturbation. second one, the coecients in front of the square brackets are
dierent. within the reduced amplitude treatment (no dilaton and partial dilaton

these observations enable us to work with general expressions for the stochastic

case eqs.(5.83) and (5.84). the partial dilaton and no dilaton cases can be simply

6 asymptotic behaviours of the gravitational wave

background

we have computed the analytical expressions for p ()d and gw at high
and low frequencies. both regimes correspond to very large (x >> 1) and very
small (x << 1) arguments of hankel functions, respectively. we consider the
three regimes:
low frequencies for  << x (x << 1), medium frequencies for
  1 (exact analytical expressions (5.38),(5.45),(5.83),(5.84)) and high frequencies
for  >> x (x >> 1) where x is the characteristic frequency (eq.(5.36)) with
order of mhz for the scale factor evolution considered.

the exact analytical form of the power spectrum, eqs.(5.38) and (5.83) requires
a careful algebraic treatment in order to compute their asymptotic behaviours. at-
tention must be put both in the range of validity as on the order of expansions used.
computation is quite long, thus we omit details here and give only the leader orders.

6.1 high frequencies

the high frequency asymptotic expressions for the no dilaton (n d) and
partial dilaton (p d) cases are formally equivalent. the leader orders for the power
spectrum and contribution to energy density can be written respectively as:

notice that leader order terms have xed dependences, independent of number
of spatial dimensions or parameters of the solutions. in fact, p ()d in both no
dilaton and partial dilaton cases present a convergent behaviour at high frequencies
as  1. in contrast, the full dilaton case is divergent in this regime as  1.
gw in the no dilaton and partial dilaton cases reachs asymptotically a constant
value. in the full dilaton case gw diverges as 2.

opposite to the high frequencies case, leader orders for low frequencies depend
explicitly from the parameter . as a consequence, each case presents a particular

7 discussion and conclusions

we have studied the production of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave
background in a cosmological model fully extracted in the context of selfconsistent
string cosmology. as seen in section ii, suitable descriptions for inationary, ra-
diation dominated and matter dominated stages can be extracted from eective
string theory in which strings propagating in the curved backgrounds are the clas-
sical sources of matter and drive selfconsistently the cosmological background. the
equation of state provided by the dynamics of string matter naturally generates in
its evolution the background in the three stages.

no exact description of the transitions among stages can be extracted in the
framework of this eective treatment. higher order corrections in low energy eec-
tive equations or more detailed study on the evolution of the gas of strings would
be neccessaries in order to handle such subject.

this lack of full understanding of the transition dynamics is an usual limita-
tion when primordial metric perturbations are computed. the main consequence
is the loss of predictibility. usual gravitational wave results depend on parameters
of the cosmological model which are not always well known ([14],[17]), or whose
physical meaning must be recovered after computation ([16]), or where the not con-
sidered transition dynamics must be recalled in order to overcome divergences ([4],
[18]). usual arguments dealing with horizon exit and reentry ([5],[6],[8]) require a
suitable cosmological description in order to be translated univocally into current
measurement abilities.

we faced this problem before to compute the metric perturbations. we elabo-
rate a cosmological minimal model of evolution for the scale factor with satisfactory
sudden and continuous transitions, provided it makes use of particular descriptive
cosmic time variables at each stage (see eqs.(3.2)). in this way, we merge our lack
of knowledge about real transitions by modelizing them in a descriptive scale factor
expressed in suitable cosmic time variables. this description is linked with the min-
imal observational universe information (standard values for transition times and
scale factor ratii reached in each stage). it provides an equivalent evolution for the
scale factor, but evades the undetermined region of transitions without introduction
of free parameters or loss of predictibility. unless the details imprinted by dynamics
transitions, in our case modelized as sudden and continuous, our computation is
expected equivalent to one made on a full physical model running on cosmic time.

we have also imposed continuity and smothness on the conformal time descrip-
tion, by constructing this on the descriptive variables (see eqs.(3.5)). continuity
of scale factor both in cosmic time and conformal time description is a feature not
always present in literature (see [24]).
in our case, the variables constructed en-

43

able us to maintain the linking with the observational universe information. this
model seems us more appropiated in order to perform primordial metric perturba-
tions computations, since no eects oughted to discontinuity in the scale factor of
the metric are introduced. not so perfect is the treatment of the dilaton eld, whose
evolution can be treated solely continuous but not smooth. further study would be
needed in order to valutate this eect.

the only gravitational waves we have computed are those produced as ampli-
cation by the evolution of background of tensorial metric perturbations. we do
not account here another possible mechanisms of generation neither amplication
of another metric perturbations.

the variable x in the power spectrum and the proper frequency  are related
in a way totally determined by the description of the cosmological scale factor evo-
lution, see eq.(5.34). the factor relating them depends of the expansion ratii, the
exit time of inationary epoch and the coecients of expansion inationary and
current epochs. being all them xed in our cosmological background linked to the
observational universe, no free parameters are introduced at this level. no one of
remaining unknown parameters, like global scale factor aii, appears on the results
of our computation. dierently from almost all string cosmology computations in
literature, rm predictions on precise frequencies ranges can be extracted in our
case.

in this way, we have computed exact, fully predictive and free-parameter ex-
pressions for the power spectrum p ()d and contribution to energy density gw
of the primordial gravitational waves background generated in the transition among
the inationary and radiation dominated stages. we have not considered the contri-
bution given by the radiation dominated-matter dominated transition in this study.
the gravitational wave contribution due to this transition is expected to be ne-
glectelly small, as compared to the rst transition. it would be expected the second
transition having a role only on the low frequencies regime [4], not so important in
anycase for our results.

7.1 the dilaton role

we have obtained drastic dierences in the stochastic background of gravita-
tional waves produced in the same scale factor evolution by considering dierents
degrees of the role played by the dilaton. the simplest case, without account of
the eect of the dilaton neither on the perturbation equation nor on the amplitude
perturbation. the second case, a partial account, with the proper perturbation
equation but still matching the reduced amplitude perturbation. the lastest case,
a full account by working with the total tensorial amplitude perturbation and per-
turbation equation.

44

the background of gravitational waves comes characterized in their shape by the
parameter , which depends of the inationary description, the ination-radiation
dominated transition (the only on which we are computing gravitational wave pro-
duction) and the role played by the dilaton. the expressions for  have been found
in the three cases (eqs.(5.4),(5.49) and (5.59)). we obtain an exact expression for
the power spectrum and energy density contribution (eqs.(5.38) and (5.45)) in terms
of hankel functions of order , formally equal in the no dilaton and partial dilaton
cases. dierences among them are oughted to  dierences. the formal expressions
in the full dilaton case are dierent (eqs.(5.83),(5.84)) both in parameter  as in
coecients involved.

the low frequency and high frequency asymptotic regimes have been discussed.
in the no dilaton case, asymptotic behaviours for power spectrum are both vanish-
3 and 1 respectively. this gives a gravitational
ing at low and high frequencies as 
wave contribution to the energy density asymptotically constant at high frequencies
of magnitude gw  1026. there is a slope change that produces a peak in the
power spectra around a characteristic frequency totally determined by the model of
x  1.48 mhz.

1

the partial dilaton case introduces the eect of the dilaton exclusively in the
tensorial perturbation equation (which is not longer equivalent to the massless real
scalar eld propagation equation [3],[9]), but not on the perturbation itself. the
general characteristic are very similar to the previous case. both asymptotic regimes
3 and 1. the peak appears
for p ()d vanish again, but with dependences 
around the same characteristic frequency, with value one order of magnitude lower
than in the no dilaton case, as well as the asymptotic constant contribution to
energy density.

5

5

in contrast, when the full dilaton role is accounted, general characteristics as
well as orders of magnitude of the spectrum are drastically modied. it has similar
values for the frequencies below the mhz, with power spectrum vanishing again as
3 . for high frequencies, in opposition to the former cases, both p ()d and gw

are increasing at high frequencies. for p ()d, an asymptotic divergent behaviour
proportional to  is found. it gives values much higher than the no dilaton and par-
tial dilaton cases. the contribution to gw is equally divergent at high frequencies
as 2. the change of slope is less visible and no clear peaks are found. the transition
from the low frequency to the high frequency regime is slower than in the previous
case and the full analytical expressions are needed on a wider range 106  109hz.
comparative tables of these summarized results can be found in tables (3), (4) and
(5). see also gs.(1) and (2).

existence of an upper cuto must be studied, whereas the full dilaton case
studied could be in contradiction with observational bounds as the current value of
total energy density in critical units   1. in that case, an end-point not predicted

45

by the current minimal model considerations could be introduced in the spectrum as
made in the literature [18]. divergent high frequencies behaviour and introduction
of an upper cuto is an usual feature in the string cosmology contexts.

7.2 string and no-string cosmologies

among the spectra computed in string cosmology contexts, it must be distin-
guished between those computed in brans-dicke frames (that we compare with our
full dilaton case) and those computed following an usual quantum eld theory way,
that is, as our no dilaton case.

the shape of the spectra computed in string cosmology contexts are very sim-
ilar. the principal features, as slope changings, are signal of the number of stages
or transitions considered in the scale factor evolution. all the known cases, co-
herently treated in brans-dicke frames, presents an increasing dependence at high
frequencies.

notice that we are not handling with a pre-big bang scenario [14]. our string
driven cosmological background runs on positive values for the proper cosmic time
t. it have been said [18] that pre big-bang scenario predicts a power spectrum with
a peak and an end-point. our analysis enable us to identify these features with the
brans-dicke framework where the low eective energy treatment is made, without
necessity of a pre big bang phase. in fact we have seen as the same universe
evolution and transitions have given dierent power spectra.
in the full dilaton
treatment, the transition among the inationary inverse power stage and the radia-
tion dominated stage gives an always increasing function for the number of particles
|  |2. it causes the high frequency range to be asymptotically divergent, feature
that disappears completely in the no dilaton or in the partial dilaton treatments.

similarly, a cosmological model involving successively a named dilaton driven
stage plus an string phase at nearly constant curvature, and a radiation dom-
inated stage produces also a spectrum increasing with frequency ([16]). as made
in the literature ([18]), an upper cuto is placed on this increasing spectra by con-
sidering the frequency making | () |2 = 1 as the maximum one produced. this
frequency is the one where one graviton per space phase unit volume and polar-
ization is produced, and after which exponential suppression is supposed. these
arguments leds to identication of the so called end-point that acts as peak
of the spectrum oughted to the increasing power with frequency. the exact values
at current time are functions of the undetermined parameters in the cosmological
model there treated [16].

46

we conclude that whatever gravitational wave computation on inationary
stages of the type extracted in string cosmology, coherently made in the brans-
dicke frame, must give an increasing spectrum. the peaks are produced by slope
change and they are signal of the transitions in the dynamics of background evo-
lution. we consider the pre-big bang scenario do not predicts a peak, but it is
supposed by dening a 1 such that |(1)|2 = 1. this proper frequency is com-
puted at the beginning of radiation dominated stage, when the wave reenters the
horizon and it must suer a redshift at current time, expressable as function of
unknown parameters of a string phase. it acts as end-point because waves with
 > 1 are supposed exponentially suppressed. since the spectrum was increasing
with frequency, the same frequency 1 constitutes a maximun (peak).

if we use the same argument in order to x an upper limit, our spectrum must
be cutted at frequency max  3.85 mhz where the power spectrum will have a
value around p ()d  5.68 1041 erg.s
cm3 and gw  3.40 1026c. these are the
same order of magnitudes of the peaks atteinted on the no dilaton and partial
dilaton cases. no conict with observational constraints look possible for such
weak signals predicted. but this argument could be too naive, since in the practical
way is equivalent to cancelate from the spectra the features introduced by the full
dilaton role.

for instance, if we want to relaxe this condition and we ask us what would
be the gravitational wave with maximum possible frequency, we can give at least a
coherency condition. now, let us ask if it is possible to produce a wave with period
lower than the planck time, that means with wavelenght lower than the planck
lenght scale. if that feature is possible, it is clear that our simplied quantum the-
ory formalism would be unappropiated in order to compute such produced particles.
we can x the upper cuto in the corresponding p  1044hz by considering that
beyond it the power spectrum of gravitational waves must be, at least, dierent
from elsewhere hitohere computed. at those values, both the no dilaton and par-
tial dilaton case predicts completely negligible production, but not is the case for
full dilaton case. its asymptotic divergent behaviour predicts enormous values for
p ()d and gw .

obviously, we do not mean that these are the right predictions of string cosmol-
ogy. without doubt, the model here treated is excessively simple in order to handle
properly the end-point of spectrum. but usual assumptions on upper exponential
suppression could be more careful revisited, since a too naive treatment in this point
can mask important features of predictions.

in relation with no-string inationary cosmologies, the so called standard ina-
tion is usually intended as a de sitter stage. notice that string driven inationary
stage describes an evolution with inverse power dependence. it must not be confused
with usual power law, although our model can be said superinationary too.

47

there is a radical dierence among the string cosmology spectra and those
obtained with an exponential inationary expansion [4]. the divergence at low
frequencies that it supposes is not found in our string driven cosmological back-
ground the high frequencies behaviour are compatible with the no dilaton case
(5.38), computed in a totally equivalent way.

if comparaison is made with the full dilaton case, a totally dierent behaviour
is found with respect to the obtained in de sitter case. notice that comparaison
among string comology inationary models and standard ination means confrontate
power and inverse power type laws with de sitter exponential ination, since until
the moment no de sitter type expansion have been coherently obtained in string
cosmology. this dierence in the inationary scale factor dynamics, together with
the appropiated teatment of metric perturbations in each framework are the main
causes of dierences among the gravitational wave power spectra in both cases.

no explicit dependence on the beginning of the inationary stage ti has been
found on the gravitational wave computation.
in anycase, further study must
be done in order to determine the inuence on the power spectra if earliers in-
ation stages are considered. gravitational wave production in frameworks with
multistages ination can be found in literature, both in the most classical cases
([26],[8],[9]) meanwhile in the string cosmology contexts there are various multistage
models ([14],[16],[17]).

in summary, there are a variety of eects aecting the gravitational wave power
spectra and justiying the dierences among our results and another string and no
string cosmologies. the most notorious dierence is oughted to the existence of a
dilaton eld and a metric evolving in a brans-dicke frame. dierences are found
on the equation for the tensorial perturbation, and the amplitude of perturbation
depends itself on the dilaton eld. our spectra here computed have showed clearly
the successive eect obtained on the gravitational wave production by introducing
the dilaton eect on the perturbation equation (partial dilaton case) and on the
perturbation itself (full dilaton case). from an unique evolution of the scale factor,
we have seen as the dilaton role on the spectra consists in increasing the high fre-
quencies regime, leading to a divergent behaviour. this is in agreement with almost
string cosmology, brans-dicke computations. in our cases without full account of
the dilaton role, we have spectra decreasing at higher frequencies, as such obtained
in the literature [4] in the more standard frameworks.

there are many points that desserve further study in order to be claried, either
from the point of view of string cosmological backgrounds and transitions dynam-
ics, either from those of gravitational wave computations in the string appropiated
frameworks. better treatments than here applied could take place in every phase of
the problem, advising us against consider this procedure or its results as denitives.
in anycase, we have proved here some aspects of the way predictions on observational
consequences can be extracted from string cosmology.
