(the diagrams amplitudes, theory, like 3 model.) since discussion quite general, easy extend results temperature dependent part retarded n-point amplitude two loops (for bosonic fermionic theory). section iv, discuss, example method, infrared mass singularities retarded photon self-energy, cancel nite temperature schwinger model  two loops. finally, present brief conclusion section v. ii. retarded self-energy 4 theory let us consider theory self-interacting real scalar eld described la- grangian density l = 1 2 m2 2 2 4! 4 (1) well known, nite temperature, real time formalism (we follow closed time path formalism although everything carried thermo eld dynamics equally well), one needs double degrees freedom, leads 2 2 matrix structure propagator gab(q) = g(0) ab (q) + g() ab (q) a, b = (2) 3 g(0) ab represents zero temperature propagator g() ab on-shell, temperature dependent part propagator and, closed time path formalism, four components temperature dependent part propagator identical. explicitly, 1 q2m2+i 2i(q0)(q2 m2) (3) g(0)(q) = 2i(q0)(q2 m2) g()(q) = 2inb(|q0|)(q2 m2) 1 q2m2i 1 1 1 1 nb(|q0|) stands bosonic distribution function (and propagator really igab). following ref. {$9809177$}, introduce following diagrammatic representation two parts propagator g(0) ab (q) = q b ; g() ab (q) = q b (4) temperature dependent part self-energy, one loop, easily obtained (this also coincides retarded self-energy order) forward scattering amplitude single on-shell thermal particle k p p k p k p (5) going beyond one loop, note two kinds diagrams self-energy two loops theory, namely, penguin rising sun diagrams. let us analyze class diagrams (which involve three internal propagators) separately. penguins, straightforward check diagrams retarded self-energy three internal propagators cut cancel, namely, + = 0. (6) p p p p 4 follows trivially fact cut propagators same, independent thermal indices, clear eq. (3) fact vertices thermal index negative sign relative + thermal index. diagrams two internal cut propagators also easily seen add zero + = 0. (7) p p p p however, diagrams two internal cut propagators add zero diagrams single cut propagator contribute. thus, temperature dependent contribution coming penguin diagrams two loop retarded self-energy seen + p p p p + + p p + + , (8) p p p p p p graphs containing permuted cuts internal propagators lower bubble understood. next, let us look rising sun diagrams self-energy two loops.once again, retarded self-energy, diagrams three internal cut propagators add zero p p + p p = 0 (9) 5 which, again, follows trivially fact cut propagators inde- pendent thermal indices vertices index relative negative sign. diagrams two internal cut propagators well single internal cut prop- agator, however, contribute, p p p + p p + p + p p (10) nonzero (diagrams permuted cuts must also considered). next recall cut propagator on-shell propagator hence thought cut open external line representing on-shell thermal particle (intuitively, one think real particle medium). therefore, combine non-vanishing penguin rising sun diagrams represent temperature dependent part retarded self-energy two loops p p () r = r p p r r p + + r r p p p + p p + r (11) used convention cut lines lower/upper half come propagator. furthermore, gr represents usual retarded propagator, namely, gr(q) = 1 q2 m2 + iq0 (12) denition retarded vertex functions given ref. {$9809177$}. thus, see temperature dependent part retarded self-energy two loops two kinds terms - terms quadratic statistical factor well ones linear statistical factor (remember cut propagator carries statistical factor). furthermore, terms 6 quadratic statistical factor corresponding two cut lines thought simply forward scattering amplitude two on-shell thermal particles. terms linear statistical factor single cut propagator, hand, correspond forward scattering amplitudes single on-shell thermal particle possible one loop self-energy vertex corrections corrections retarded evaluated zero temperature. terms rather simple evaluate, energy integrals help delta functions eq. (3). one obtains diagrams depend external momentum, relevant temperature dependent part two loops given () r (p0, ~p) = 2 1 r {nb(k)  d3k (2)3 d3q (2)3 1 k 1 q 16 z + nb(k)nb(q) } , (13) k q~k2 + m2, ~r = ~k + ~q ~p d(k, q, r) = 1 p0 + + k + q + r + 1 (p0 + i) + k + q + r . (14) form retarded thermal self-energy rather convenient, particularly calculation imaginary part related plasma damping rate. result agrees one obtained parwani ref. , analytic continuation imaginary time formalism. way, one establish explicit equivalence two formalisms two loops much like one loop case. iii. retarded greens functions qed let us next consider qed theory described lagrangian density l = 1 4 ff + (i/ + ea/), (15) photon eld, f eld strength tensor dirac eld. apart matrix factor replacement (nb) fermionic distribution function 7 nf , structure electron propagator similar eqs. (2) (3). how- ever, let us note that, purpose discussion, actual form propagator irrelevant, crucial temperature dependent part propagator (bosonic fermionic) thermal indices closed time path formal- ism. (consequently, discussion quite general without restrictions particular theory.) assuming largest time vertex one conected external line p, retarded thermal self-energy photons one loop given forward scattering amplitude single on-shell thermal particle p p ret p p p p r + (16) note propagator momentum owing outwards largest time vertex retarded one momentum owing towards vertex advanced (see ref. {$9809177$} details). going beyond one loop, note two classes diagrams - ones containing overlapping divergences others structure one loop diagrams self-energy correction one internal propagators. classes diagrams contains internal propagators. before, easy check sum diagrams containing cut propagators, four cut propagators well three cut propagators individually vanish follows fact cut propagators irrespective thermal indices vertices thermal index extra negative sign. graphs two internal cut propagators also cancel, them. graphs single cut propagator contribute. adding remembering cut propagator on-shell hence thought external thermal particle, nd temperature dependent part retarded self-energy, two loops, written p p + p 8 p () ret + p p p + p p + r r r + (f) r (i) p + p p p r rr + rr (d) (e) p p + r (g) r (h) p p p p p p p p r r r + rr + r (a) (b) (c) p p p p p r r r + r r r + r r (17) (j) (k) (l) here, diagrams obtained permutation external lines understood. again, clear temperature dependent part two loop retarded self- energy contains terms quadratic statistical factors well ones linear statistical factor. terms quadratic statistical factor, come diagrams two cut propagators simple description forward scattering amplitude two on-shell thermal particles. hand, 9 linear statistical factor, come diagrams single cut propagator described terms forward scattering amplitudes single on-shell thermal particle possible one loop self-energy vertex corrections. last section, note corrections retarded evaluated zero temperature. is, indeed, simple description two loop retarded self-energy much simpler evaluate brute force calculation would entail. let us evalulate next temperature dependent part retarded three point func- tion, two loops order (although three photon vertex vanishes qed charge conjugation, analysis also apply theory like qcd, three gluon ver- tex non-zero). without going much detail, let us note two classes diagrams contributing - one containing diagrams thought vertex correction one loop three point function graphs contain one loop self-energy correction one internal propagators one loop three point vertex function. diagrams two classes graphs consist six internal propagators straightforward check sum graphs six cut propagators, cut propagators, four cut propagators well three cut propagators in- dividually vanish. graphs two cut propagators also add zero, all. furthermore, graphs single cut propagator contribute. non-vanishing diagrams given simple graphical representation remembering cut line on-shell thought external thermal particle (of medium). thus get, example, graphical equations p 1 p 2 p 3 () ret p 1 p 2 p 3 r r rr + (a) 10 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 1 p 2 p 3 r r r + r aa + (b) (c) p 2 p 1 r r p 3 + p 1 p 2 ra rr p 3 + (d) p 1 rr p 2 p 1 + (e) p 2 r r (g) p 3 + p 3 p 3 p 1 r (h) p 3 (f) p 3 + p 2 p 1 p 1 r r p 2 p 1 + p 2 p 3 r r r (18) (i) (j) () ret p 2 p 1 p 2 p 3 ra rr + (a) 11 p 1 p 2 p 3 rr r r (b) p 3 + p 2 p 1 aa r r + p 2 p 3 aa p 1 p 3 + (c) p 1 aa ra p 2 + (d) (e) p 1 r (f) p 3 p 1 + p 3 p 1 p 2 r r r r p 3 + p 1 + p 2 p 2 r (g) p 3 p 2 p 2 p 1 p 3 r r r r + r r r (19) (h) (i) (j) forward scattering amplitudes, relevant permutations external lines understood. here, assumed vertex external momentum p1 corresponds largest time vertex. then, propagators momentum owing towards vertex advanced, whereas propagators momentum owing outward largest time vertex retarded. again, note familiar pattern. temperature dependent part retarded three point function, two loops, consists 12 two types terms. ones quadratic statistical factor correspond sim- ple forward scattering amplitudes two on-shell thermal particles (of medium) whereas ones linear statistical factor correspond forward scattering am- plitude single thermal on-shell particle possible one loop self-energy vertex corrections. retarded one loop corrections, calculated zero temperature, may contain ultraviolet divergences must renormalized usual. analysis two loop amplitudes far, quite straightforward nd simple, general diagrammatic description two loop retarded n-point amplitudes. temperature dependent part general two loop retarded n-point amplitude written terms two classes diagrams. rst class would involve simple forward scattering amplitudes two on-shell thermal particles (two cut lines) would correspond terms quadratic statistical factor. second class diagrams would involve forward scattering amplitudes single on-shell thermal particle (one cut line) possible one loop self-energy vertex corrections, corrections retarded evaluated zero temperature. iv. application section, study qed2 model nite temperature and, appli- cation general method, show infrared mass singularities temperature dependent retarded photon self-energy cancel two loops limit vanishing fermion mass. gauge theory, described lagrangian density (15) 1 + 1 dimen- sions, well behaved ultraviolet region. simplicity, work feynman gauge although choice gauge immaterial, since nite temperature results gauge invariant schwinger model. look photon self-energy theory, then, discussions, recognize temperature dependent part retarded self-energy, one loop, written terms forward scattering amplitude thermal on-shell fermion shown 13 eq. (16). two diagrams give identical contribution, since inverting direction internal momentum ow interchanges advanced retarded propagators. unlike higher dimensions, 1 + 1 dimensions, one transverse structure polarization tensor nite temperature. furthermore, special identities dirac trace 1 + 1 dimensions make one loop calculation quite simple give () r(1)(p0, p1) = = nf (|k0|) 2e2m2 z d2k e2m2 (k1 + p1)2 m2 + i(k0 + p0) kk+p " 2 z dk1 nf (k) k + p0 k+p + 1 (k2 m2) 1 k + p0 + k+p + 1 + k p0 k+p 1 k p0 + k+p i# (20) here, identied space components p k p1 k1 respectively, nf fermionic distribution function k = q(k1)2 + m2. clearly, vanishes 0. going beyond one loop, let us note infrared mass singularities retarded photon self-energy come graphs one loop self-energy correction internal fermion propagator, particularly internal photon propagator cut (irrespective whether cuts diagram). consider, example, following set thermal diagrams q p k (a) q q q q q p + p k (b) + p p k (c) p ret (21) cut photon line would give infrared divergent contribution form (coming k 0) i(t /) = z d2k (2)2 1 e|k0|/t 1 (k2 2) = 1 (2)2 " 2 + 1 2 ln + # (22) here, infrared regulating photon mass set zero end. isolated factor, photon momentum safely set zero rest diagrams. 14 seen earlier, two loops, graphs two cut propagators single cut propagator give non-vanishing contribution. little bit analysis shows graphs single cut photon propagator, shown fig. (17-g) contain retarded fermion loop calculated zero temperature, infrared divergent contributions cancel. graphs two cut propagators, shown set (21), expressed terms forward scattering amplitudes (a), (b) (c), indicated graphical equation (17). evaluate these, note consequence special kinematic relations hold 1 + 1 dimensions, appear numerator overall factor m2 (compare eq.
