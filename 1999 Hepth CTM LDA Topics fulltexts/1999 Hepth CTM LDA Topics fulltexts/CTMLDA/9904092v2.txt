abstract

we study open descendants of non-supersymmetric type iib asymmetric (freely act-

ing) orbifolds with zero cosmological constant. a generic feature of these models is that

supersymmetry remains unbroken on the brane at all mass levels, while it is broken in

the bulk in a way that preserves fermi-bose degeneracy in both the massless and massive

(closed string) spectrum. this property remains valid in the heterotic dual of the type ii

model but only for the massless excitations. a possible application of these constructions

concerns scenarios of low-energy supersymmetry breaking with large dimensions.

1. introduction

one of the longest outstanding problems in theoretical physics is to explain why

the cosmological constant is extremely small and possibly vanishes after supersymmetry

breaking. it was recently argued that there is a class of non-supersymmetric type ii string

compactications whose vacuum energy vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory due to

fermi-bose degeneracy [1,2,3]. these models are based on asymmetric orbifold construc-

tions of non-abelian nature, where supersymmetry is broken in a special way, so that the

vacuum amplitude can be shown to vanish up to genus-2 by explicit computation [3]. this

vanishing was argued to persist in higher orders as well, while at the non-perturbative level

a cosmological constant may be generated, although it will be exponentially suppressed in

the weak coupling limit [4].

since these constructions were made in the framework of type ii string theories, their

obvious disadvantage is the absence of non-abelian gauge symmetries at the perturba-
tive level.1 it is then natural to ask whether they admit open descendants that support

non-abelian gauge groups and chiral matter, without destroying their main property of van-

ishing vacuum energy [5]. a recent analysis has indeed shown that such a generalization

is possible [6].

in this work we perform a systematic study of the open descendants in non-

supersymmetric type iib asymmetric orbifolds with zero cosmological constant, using the

formalism of [7,8]. the models we study can be described as scherk-schwarz deformations
of six-dimensional (6d) vacua with n = 1 supersymmetry that are asymmetric generaliza-
tions of the class studied in [9]. in particular, we derive the full partition function of the

type i model based on the freely acting orbifold of [4]. a peculiar feature of the parent
type iib vacuum is that both r   and r  0 limits lead to (6d) supersymmetric
theories, with r the radius of the circle used to break supersymmetry. this is due to

an exact t-duality symmetry present even after supersymmetry breaking. t-duality is

of course broken in the type i theory that has a (6d) supersymmetric decompactication
limit, while for r  0 there are linear or logarithmic divergences, in the case of one or
in the t-dual type i picture, the divergences reect the
two dimensions, respectively.

existence of non vanishing local tadpoles in the directions transverse to the d-branes [10].

1 it would be interesting to study these models at special points of moduli space and in
the presence of rr-backgrounds, where extra massless non-abelian gauge particles appear non-

perturbatively. in section 5, we discuss this issue using heterotictype ii duality.

1

these tadpoles remain non-vanishing for any conguration of d-branes, unlike the familiar
situation for the so(16)  so(16) model in nine dimensions [11].

although broken in the closed string sector, supersymmetry remains unbroken on

the d-branes. this is consistent with the results of [9], since using t-duality, an exact

symmetry of the parent type iib theory, one can always break supersymmetry along a

direction transverse to the branes. notice, however, that unlike the constructions of [9],

where supersymmetry is present only for the massless excitations of the d-branes, in our

case it is preserved in all mass levels. the same property appears to be present for the

massless excitations in the gauge (non-perturbative) sector of the type of closed string

models of [4], at enhanced symmetry points of their moduli space, as we argue by analysing

the partition function on the heterotic side. we also study the open descendants of another

class of non-supersymmetric type iib vacua based on the free-fermionic construction [12].

these models are dened at particular points of moduli space, and thus they can not be

continuously deformed to higher dimensional supersymmetric models. the open sector has

a gauge group with reduced rank and, as in the previous models, unbroken supersymmetry

at all mass levels.

the present paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we review the non-super-

symmetric type ii model of [4] with vanishing vacuum energy.

in section 3 we derive

its one-loop partition function and discuss its 6d limit. in section 4 we derive its open
descendants that have n = 2 unbroken supersymmetry to all mass levels, and give the full
genus-1 vacuum amplitude, that receives contributions from the torus, the klein bottle,

the annulus and the mobius strip.

in section 5 we study the eects of supersymmetry

breaking on the non-abelian gauge sector of the heterotic dual of the type ii model of

[4], by analysing the corresponding partition function.

in section 6 we derive the open

descendants of a dierent type iib 4d model, with xed values for all the internal radii,

using the free-fermionic formulation. finally, section 6 contains our concluding remarks.

2. the orbifold generators and their algebra

the asymmetric orbifold we will consider in this section is generated by the following

two elements [4]:

f =(cid:2)(14, 1 ; 15) , (04, vl ; 4, vr) , ()fr(cid:3) ,
g =(cid:2)(15 ; 14, 1) , (4, wl ; 04, wr) , ()fl(cid:3) .

2

(2.1)

here the rst entry inside the square brackets denotes rotations, the second denotes shifts

on the internal compactication lattice while the third corresponds to a genuine world-sheet

symmetry. moreover, a semicolon separates holomorphic and antiholomorphic coordinates.

in order to implement an asymmetric z2 rotation, the internal four-dimensional torus must
split into a product of four circles with self-dual radius r = , such that the lattice
factorizes into a holomorphic and an antiholomorphic part.  is then a shift by r/2, as

required by level matching and multi-loop modular invariance conditions [13]. no further

constraints are imposed on the radius of the fth coordinate, while vl,r = wr,l. the shifts

vl,r in the fth coordinate, a2 shifts in the notation of [14], act as

x(z)  x(z) + 1
x(z)  x(z)  1

to the level matching condition, thereby balancing the contribution of the shifts that act
on t 4.

due to the presence of ()fl,r, the g (f ) generator projects out all the gravitini
coming from the (anti-)holomorphic sector, and therefore the combined action of f and

g breaks supersymmetry completely. the shifts give masses to the corresponding twisted

sectors, ensuring that no massless gravitons originate from them. although the model is

non-supersymmetric, it has been argued in [1] that one-loop and higher order perturbative

corrections to the cosmological constant vanish. there are, however, non-perturbative

contributions originating from wrapped d-branes that can be studied perturbatively on

the dual heterotic theory [4].

the generators in (2.1) satisfy the algebra

f  f =(cid:2)(15 ; 15) , (05 ; (2)4, 0) , 1(cid:3) ,
g  g =(cid:2)(15 ; 15) , ((2)4, 0 ; 05) , 1(cid:3) ,
f  g =(cid:2)(14, 1 ; 14, 1) , (4, 0 ; 4, 0) , ()fl+fr(cid:3) ,
g  f =(cid:2)(14, 1 ; 14, 1) , (4, 0 ; 4, 0) , ()fl+fr(cid:3) ,

thus revealing the non-abelian nature of the orbifold group s. when restricted to the point

group p , dened as the quotient of the space group s by the generators of pure translations
[15], the orbifold group reduces to a simple abelian group, z2  z2, where the z2 factors
are generated by f and g. then one can rst mod out the theory by  = {f 2, g2}, thereby
dening a new compactication lattice, and then quotient by the point group p = z2z2.
in the next section we will follow this procedure.
in fact, the model (2.1) is a freely
acting asymmetric orbifold of t 4/z2 by f , and can also be interpreted as an asymmetric
scherk-schwarz deformation by doubling the radius of the fth coordinate [16,9]. due

to the asymmetric nature of the deformation that acts simultaneously on momentum and

winding modes, the lattice contribution to the resulting model is invariant under t-duality.

as a result, the standard scherk-schwarz breaking model is equivalent to the m-theory

breaking one. an alternative approach, leading to the same result, would be to mod out

directly by the space group s [6].

3. the torus partition function

the starting point in the construction of the orbifold described in the previous sec-

tion is the toroidal compactication of the type ii superstring on a ve-dimensional lattice
(5,5) = [su(2)]4  [(1,1)(r)], where su(2) denotes the su(2) lattice and (1,1)(r) is the
contribution of a single circle of radius r. in order to construct the open-descendants of

this model we start from the type iib superstring, that is invariant under the action of

the world-sheet parity . using the so(8) characters o8, v8, s8 and c8, associated to

the conjugacy classes of identity, vector, spinor and conjugate spinor representations, re-

spectively, to represent the contribution of the world-sheet fermions, the partition function

reads:

t0 = |v8  s8|2 (cid:2)|1|2 + |2|2(cid:3)4

zm,n(q, q) .

(3.1)

here 1 and 2 indicate the two characters of su(2) at level one, corresponding to the

conjugacy classes of the singlet and the doublet representation, and

zm,n(q, q) = xm,nz

with q = e2i .

,

following the strategy outlined in the previous section, we mod out the toroidal am-

plitude (3.1) by the generators of  that act as pure asymmetric lattice shifts. this results

in a new toroidal compactication where the su(2)4 lattice is turned into an so(8) lattice:

t = |v8  s8|2 (cid:2)|o8|2 + |v8|2 + |s8|2 + |c8|2(cid:3) zm,n(q, q) .

the presence of a non-trivial background for the ns  ns antisymmetric tensor in the
so(8) lattice reduces the rank of the chan-paton (cp) gauge group by a factor equal to

the rank of the antisymmetric tensor [17,18,19,20]. as we will see in the next section, this

turns out to be crucial in order to get a consistent model.

acting now with the point group p , one gets the following formal expression for the

partition function

t = 1

4(cid:2)t(0,0) + t(0,f ) + t(0,g) + t(0,f g)+
+ t(f,0) + t(f,f ) + t(g,0) + t(g,g) + t(f g,0) + t(f g,f g)(cid:3) .

(3.2)

note the absence of the disconnected modular orbit generated by t(f,g). this fact has two
dierent explanations in the space group or in the point group approaches of the orbifold.

in the former case, it is due to the fact that the path integral receives contributions only
from commuting pairs of spin structures [15], whereas in the latter case, t(f,g) vanishes
due to the simultaneous action of shifts and rotations [16].

the amplitudes t(a,b) with a, b  {0, f, g, f g} are given by
t(0,0) = |v4o4 + o4v4  s4s4  c4c4|2(cid:2)|o8|2 + |v8|2 + |s8|2 + |c8|2(cid:3)zm,n ,

in order to implement the orbifold projection, we have broken the so(8)

from expressions (3.3)-(3.6), one can check that the partition function vanishes identically

in each sector.

expanding the internal characters and the theta functions in powers of q, and keeping

only leading terms, we get the following massless contributions

tuntw  |v4o4|2 + |s4s4|2  (o4v4)(c4c4)  (c4c4)(o4v 4) ,
tf gtw  8|o4s4  c4o4|2 ,

(3.7)

that translate into the following ve-dimensional eld content: {g , 7a, 6; 8} from the
untwisted sector, and 8{a, 5; 2} from the f g-twisted sector. here, g, a,  and 
denote the ve dimensional graviton, vector, real scalar and dirac fermion, respectively.
the factor 8 in tf gtw counts the number of xed points left invariant by the shifts.

due to the asymmetric shift on the fth coordinate, the torus amplitude is invariant
under t-duality. as a result, the amplitude in the decompactication limit r  
coincides with the one in the r  0 limit, aside from volume factors. the former case
corresponds to the decompactication limit of type iib on the supersymmetric t 4/z2
orbifold, with 21 tensor multiplets coupled to n = (2, 0) supergravity in six dimensions.
the latter case has a natural interpretation in terms of type iia compactied on the same
orbifold, with 6d n = (1, 1) supergravity coupled to 20 vector multiplets.
in order to
have a consistent assignment of quantum numbers [9], in the r   (r  0) limit it is
required to double (halve) the radius. consequently, the terms zm,n contribute with an
additional factor of 2 that partially compensates the 1/4 factor in the partition function
(3.2), yielding the expected multiplicity of states in the t 4/z2 orbifolds.

4. open descendants

following [7,8] the construction of open descendants resembles a z2 orbifold where the
z2 symmetry is the world-sheet parity . the untwisted sector of the parameter space
orbifold consists of closed unoriented strings, whose contribution to the total partition

function is

where the klein bottle amplitude

that correspond to the choice  = 2. at the massless level one nds

k  (v4o4  s4s4) + 4 (o4s4  c4o4) ,

that symmetrizes correctly the torus amplitude (3.7). the factor 4 has to be interpreted
as n+  n = 6  2, where n is the number of xed points with  = 1 [19,20]. the
resulting spectrum of massless excitations then results in the following ve-dimensional
elds: {g , 2a , 5 ; 4} from the untwisted sector and {2a , 26 ; 8} from the f g-
twisted sector. since k is supersymmetric, the contribution of the klein bottle amplitude
to the 1-loop cosmological constant vanishes identically. although the asymmetric nature

of the orbifold is reected in the presence of the signs in the lattice sums in (4.1), the open

descendants only feel the left-right symmetric (supersymmetric) generator f g [21].

in the transverse channel, the klein bottle amplitude is

with a massless tadpole proportional to

ek = 24 r (v4o4  s4s4) + massive .

(4.2)

there are no volume factors relative to t 4, because we are working at the so(8) rational

point. something particularly interesting happens due to the presence of the so(8) lattice,

which ensures the consistency of the theory. to appreciate the meaning of eq. (4.2), let
us recall that, in the presence of a quantized background for the ns  ns antisymmetric
tensor bij , the transverse klein bottle amplitude associated to the t 4/z2 orbifold reads
[20]

ek (cid:20)v +

(4.3)

here v is the volume of the internal lattice and r is the rank of bij . for the so(8) lattice
r = 2 and v = 1

2 [22], and the transverse klein bottle amplitude is

ek  (v4o4  s4s4) .

8

(4.4)

although both (4.3) and (4.4) are consistent with the associated torus amplitude

t  |v4o4  s4s4|2 + |o4v4  c4c4|2 + . . . ,

(4.5)

only (4.4) is compatible with (3.7). a similar phenomenon will take place in the open

sector, along with an identication of neumann and dirichlet charges.

the twisted sector of the parameter space orbifold

1

2 (a + m) ,

corresponds to the open unoriented sector of the spectrum and carries multiplicities associ-

ated to cp charges (d-branes) that live at the ends of the open strings. in ve dimensions,

there are two dierent open sectors that dier by a sign in the massive f g-twisted states.

this ambiguity is related to the two possible identications of neumann and dirichlet

charges under the action of the f and g generators. the annulus and mobius strip ampli-

tudes are then given by

the spectrum associated with the open unoriented sector can thus be arranged in n =

the adjoint representation of u(8) and a massless hypermultiplet in the representations
28  28 from the untwisted sector, as well as 2 full massive hypermultiplets in the adjoint
representation for model 1 and in the 28  36 for model 2 from the twisted sector. the
doubling of the number of hypermultiplets in the twisted sector is due to the presence of
the antisymmetric tensor [19,20] , and to the fact that the lattice sum z2m+1 contributes
twice2 to each mass level. since a and m are supersymmetric, the contribution of the
open unoriented sector to the 1-loop cosmological constant vanishes identically.

as shown in [6], one can derive this open unoriented spectrum by modding out the
supersymmetric t 4/z2 orbifold compactication [23,8,24] by the t-duality contained in f .
this operation is not always allowed. in fact, for orbifold compactications in the presence

of a quantized antisymmetric tensor bij , the transverse annulus amplitude involves the
following terms [20]

ea (cid:20)2r/2 (n + n )v +

v
+(cid:20)2r/2 (n + n )v 

(d + d)

(cid:21)2
v

(d + d)

(cid:21)2

(v4o4  s4s4)+

(o4v4  c4c4) ,

coming from the torus amplitude (4.5). in our case, it is crucial that the compactication

four-torus is an so(8) lattice, since at the so(8) point

ea (cid:2)(n + n ) + (d + d)(cid:3)2

(v4o4  s4s4) +(cid:2)(n + n )  (d + d)(cid:3)2

(o4v4  c4c4) .

thus, we can mod out by t-duality, identifying the neumann and dirichlet charges3, and
obtain the amplitude

ea  (n + n )2(v4o4  s4s4) ,

2 this corrects a mistake in [6] in the counting of multiplicities for the open sector.
3 in our conventions n  d (n  d) corresponds to model 1(2).

compatible with (3.7).

we now study the limiting behaviour for large and small radius. as r  0, inspection
of the transverse amplitudes reveals that new tadpoles arise due to odd windings, that

become massless. these new tadpoles receive a contribution also from the transverse klein
bottle amplitude. trying to impose local tadpole cancellation, one then nds m  m 6= 0,
in contrast with (4.8). this incompatibility can not be resolved by adding wilson lines as

in the case of toroidal and supersymmetric orbifold compactications. thus, for small r,

the local non-vanishing tadpoles induce linear divergences in the 5d gauge theory on the

branes [10].

the situation is dierent for r  . after doubling the radius, the sums over
momenta with alternating signs now vanish, while the others give additional factors of

two. in the closed unoriented sector this leads to a massless spectrum consisting of 5 tensor
multiplets and 16 hypermultiplets coupled to n = (1, 0) supergravity in six dimensions.
the interpretation of the open unoriented sector is more subtle. after taking the limit

and

m  2(m + m )(bo4bv4  bc4bc4) .

the factor of two reveals a doubling of degrees of freedom that reects a doubling of cp
charges, m  (n, d). then, consistency of the model leads to the following amplitudes

a (2n n + 2dd)(v4o4  s4s4) + (n 2 + n

)(o4v4  c4c4)+
+ 2(2n d + 2nd)(o4s4  c4o4) + 2(2n d + 2n d)(v4c4  s4v4) ,

and

m  (n + n + d + d)(o4v4  c4c4) .

all these results would be obtained directly starting from the limiting torus amplitude.
the massless spectrum consists of n = (1, 0) vector multiplets in the adjoint of u(8) 
u(8),with hypermultiplets in the representations (28; 1)  (28; 1)  (1; 28)  (1; 28) 
(8; 8)  (8; 8). this is precisely the spectrum associated to the t 4/z2 orbifold in the
presence of a quantized bij [8,19,20]. the additional tensor multiplets take part in a

generalized green-schwarz mechanism for the cancellation of the residual anomalies [25].

5. supersymmetry breaking on the heterotic side

an interesting question is whether the open sector of the model discussed above re-

mains supersymmetric at the non-perturbative level. a way to address this question would

be to nd a heterotic dual. before breaking supersymmetry with the freely acting projec-
tion, the presence of a quantized bij in the t 4/z2 suggests that a possible heterotic dual
should have reduced rank [18,26]. this is possible only for the type i description which is

related to type iia and has only one tensor multiplet. moreover, local tadpole cancellation
requires to separate the branes so that the resulting gauge group is u(4)2

44. how-
ever, in the presence of supersymmetry breaking there is no perturbative heterotic dual,

88  u(4)2

since the action of the freely acting projection identies the d8 with the d4 branes on the
type i side.

nevertheless, one can address the question of supersymmetry breaking in the non-

perturbative gauge sector of the type ii model of [4], by analysing the partition function
of its heterotic dual.4 the starting point of the construction is the compactication on the

narain lattice:

(5,21) = e8  e8  so(8)  (1,1)(r) ,

where the e8 factors refer to the ane be8 algebra, so(8) denotes the four dimensional

compactication torus at the so(8) symmetry enhancement point and (1,1)(r) denotes
the compactication on a circle of radius r. in terms of so(8) and e8 characters, the

partition function is then

z (0)
het =

1

4 4 (v8  s8) e8 e8 (cid:2)|o8|2 + |v8|2 + |s8|2 + |c8|2(cid:3) zm,n .

the massless level contains the 5d n = 4 supergravity multiplet coupled to vector multi-
plets with gauge group e8  e8  so(8).

the action of the non-supersymmetric orbifold generator fhet on the heterotic side

can be dened using heterotictype iia duality and the adiabatic argument [4]. it is given

by

fhet =(cid:2)(15 ; 14 , 1) , (5 ; 04, ) , s2(e8  e8) , ()fl(cid:3) ,

4 strictly speaking, the type ii model of [4] does not have points of enhanced non-abelian
symmetry because of the presence of the ns  ns antisymmetric tensor in the so(8) lattice.

however, its heterotic dual can be deformed to a point of enhanced gauge symmetry that we

discuss here.

13

with  denoting the action of a z2 shift on the compactication lattice and s2 the permu-
tation of the two e8 lattices [4]. the resulting partition function is

as a result of the shift on the circle, the twisted sector is massive, while the q-expansion

of the untwisted sector

(16 + 128q + . . .)(q1 + 252q + . . .) ()mzm,n ,

reveals a fermi-bose degeneracy for the massless states, because of the absence of the q0

term.

it is interesting to study the contributions of the various massless states to the

vacuum energy. expanding each term of the untwisted sector

z untw
het q1/2 q1(1 + 4q)[(4 + 4)q1/2  2(2 + 2)q1/2][1 + (248 + 248)q]

+ q1/2 q1(1 + 4q)[(4 + 4)q1/2 + 2(2 + 2)q1/2][1 + (248  248)q]

 [(1 + 6q)(1 + 6q)  4  4q] ,

one can see that the contribution of the massless states to the vacuum energy vanishes

for the following reasons. on the one hand, in the gravitational sector, whose massless
excitations are {g , b ,  , 4a}, {a , 4} and the spinors { ,  } in the adjoint and
(4 , 4) representations of so(4) so(4), respectively, the fhet projection breaks eectively
supersymmetry, while preserving fermi-bose degeneracy. on the other hand, the gauge

sector is eectively supersymmetric. in fact, the projection gives a plus sign to the space-

time bosons v8 and to the diagonal combination of the two e8 factors and a minus sign
to the space-time fermions s8 and to the antisymmetric combination of the gauge factors.
as a result, a full n = 4 vector supermultiplet in the adjoint of e8 survives the orbifold

14

projection. this property, however, holds only for massless states. for instance, at the

rst mass level the decomposition of the product of two adjoint representations,

248  248 = 1s  248a  3875s  27000s  30380a ,

reveals that bosons and fermions in the gauge sector appear in symmetric and antisym-

metric representations, respectively, and thus do not t any more into supermultiplets.

by heterotictype ii duality, one can then argue that supersymmetry remains unbro-

ken for the massless non-abelian gauge sector that arises non-perturbatively at singular

points of k3 from d2 branes wrapped around collapsing 2-cycles. this phenomenon is

similar to the m-theory breaking of type i models with the direction of supersymmetry

breaking transverse to the d-brane [9].

6. free-fermions and open strings

an alternative approach to the construction of non-supersymmetric vacua with vanish-

ing cosmological constant is based on the fermionic construction [12]. using this approach,

the authors of [5] constructed a series of non-supersymmetric models in d = 4 with fermi-

bose degeneracy at each mass level. they found two dierent classes of models related to
asymmetric z2  z2 orbifolds. in the rst class the two z2 twists break n = (4, 4) super-
symmetry to n = (2, 0) and n = (0, 2), respectively. in the second class supersymmetry
is broken to n = (2, 0) for the rst z2 and to n = (0, 4) for the second one. although the
full z2 z2 model is not supersymmetric, each projection is supersymmetric thus ensuring
the vanishing of the cosmological constant. only model i in [5] is left-right symmetric and

can therefore be modded out by  to construct open descendants.

the construction of the four dimensional z2  z2 orbifold starts with the type iib

superstring compactied on the so(12) lattice whose partition function is

t = |v8  s8|2h|o12|2 + |v12|2 + |s12|2 + |c12|2i .

following [12], the z2z2 projection can be dened by adding the following sets of periodic
fermions

s = {i , i} , s = {i , yi} , s = {i , i} , s



= {i , yi} ,

15

to those that dene the so(12) lattice, where i = 1, . . . , 4 labels the coordinates of the
internal t 4 on which the orbifold generators act non-trivially. in the orbifold language this
translates into the generators:

f =h(14, 12 ; 16) , (06 ; s4, 02) , ()fri
g =h(16 ; 14, 12) , (s4, 02 ; 06) , ()fli ,

where s is a z2 shift on the internal bosons. as a result, the partition function of the
orbifold model can be arranged into 64 characters. they can be generated from the identity

0,1 = v4o4o4o4o4 + o4v4o4v4v4  s4s4v4o4v4  c4c4v4v4o4 .

by applying a modular s transformation. besides 0,1, the massless characters in the
untwisted sector are:

0,2 = v4o4v4o4v4 + o4v4v4v4o4  s4s4o4o4o4  c4c4o4v4v4 ,
0,9 = v4o4o4v4v4 + o4v4o4o4o4  s4s4v4v4o4  c4c4v4o4v4 ,
0,10 = v4o4v4v4o4 + o4v4v4o4v4  s4s4o4v4v4  c4c4o4o4o4 .

in the f -twisted sector, they are given by

f,1 = o4c4o4o4s4 + v4s4o4v4c4  c4v4v4o4c4  s4o4v4v4s4 ,
f,2 = o4c4v4v4s4 + v4s4v4o4c4  c4v4o4v4c4  s4o4o4o4s4 ,
f,3 = o4c4v4v4c4 + v4s4o4v4s4  c4v4v4o4s4  s4o4o4o4c4 ,
f,4 = o4c4o4o4c4 + v4s4v4o4s4  c4v4o4v4s4  s4o4v4v4c4 ,

in the g-twisted sector by

g,1 = o4o4o4c4c4 + v4v4o4s4s4  s4c4v4c4s4  c4s4v4s4c4 ,
g,2 = o4o4o4s4s4 + v4v4o4c4c4  s4c4v4s4c4  c4s4v4c4s4 ,
g,3 = o4o4o4s4c4 + v4v4o4c4s4  s4c4v4c4c4  c4s4v4s4s4 ,
g,4 = o4o4o4c4s4 + v4v4o4s4c4  s4c4v4s4s4  c4s4v4c4c4 ,

and, nally, in the f g-twisted sector by

f g,1 = o4s4o4c4o4 + v4c4o4s4v4  s4v4v4s4o4  c4o4v4c4v4 ,
f g,2 = o4s4v4c4v4 + v4c4v4s4o4  s4v4o4s4v4  c4o4o4c4o4 ,
f g,9 = o4s4o4s4o4 + v4c4o4c4v4  s4v4v4c4o4  c4o4v4s4v4 ,
f g,10 = o4s4v4s4v4 + v4c4v4c4o4  s4v4o4c4v4  c4o4o4s4o4 .

16

these massless characters appear in the partition function as follows

tm2=0 =|0,1|2 + |0,2|2 + 0,9 0,10 + 0,10 0,9+

+ (f,1 g,1 + f,2 g,2 + f,3 g,3 + f,4 g,4 + c.c.) +
+ |f g,1|2 + |f g,2|2 + f g,9 f g,10 + f g,10 f g,9 .

the 4-dimensional massless spectrum resulting from the above expression yields {g, b,
8a, 13, 16, 32; 16} for the untwisted sector, {32 ; 16} for the f and g twisted
sectors and {4a , 24 ; 16} for the f g-twisted sector.

in order to construct the open descendants, one needs the characters that appear in

the partition function symmetrically in the holomorphic and in the antiholomorphic sectors
or combined with their conjugates. since in our case all characters are self-conjugate 5 the

only relevant contribution to the torus partition function reads:

0,5 = v4o4s4c4c4 + o4v4s4s4s4  s4s4c4c4s4  c4c4c4s4c4 ,
0,6 = v4o4c4c4s4 + o4v4c4s4c4  s4s4s4c4c4  c4c4s4s4s4 ,
0,7 = v4o4c4c4c4 + o4v4c4s4s4  s4s4s4c4s4  c4c4s4s4c4 ,
0,8 = v4o4s4c4s4 + o4v4s4s4c4  s4s4c4c4c4  c4c4c4s4s4 ,

from the untwisted sector, and

f g,4 = o4s4v4c4o4 + v4c4v4s4v4  s4v4o4s4o4  c4o4o4c4v4 ,
f g,5 = o4s4s4o4s4 + v4c4s4v4c4  s4v4c4v4s4  c4o4c4o4c4 ,

17

from the f g-twisted sector. the f and g-twisted sectors do not contribute to the klein

bottle, annulus and mobius strip amplitudes, because they give rise to non diagonal con-

tributions in the partition function.

we can now proceed to construct the open descendants following [7,8]. the direct

channel klein bottle amplitude is:

k = x{0,f g}

8x=1

, .

the massless excitations of the closed unoriented sector comprise the graviton, 4 abelian
vectors, 54 scalars and 32 dirac spinors. the klein bottle amplitude has n = 2 super-
symmetry and therefore does not generate any cosmological constant. in the transverse

channel

develops massless tadpoles, whose cancellation require the introduction of open strings.

ek = 23 (0,1 + 0,2 + f g,3 + f g,4) ,

in principle, one is free to introduce in the klein bottle amplitude signs that are

consistent with the crosscap constraint [27,28] (see also [29]). the choice which includes

eight positive and eight negative signs results in a model without an open sector, similarly

to what was found in [30]. this follows from the unitarity of the s matrix, that implies

that each character transforms into 0,1 with a positive sign, so that the transverse klein
bottle does not contain the identity and has no ir divergences. the only possible solution

is an open descendant without open strings.

inspection of (6.1) allows for 16 dierent cp charges. the transverse channel annulus

thus reads

ea = 23 x{0,f g}

8x=1

b2

, , ,

while the transverse mobius amplitude is

fm = 2h0,1 b0,1 b0,1 + 0,2 b0,2 b0,2 + f g,3 bf g,3 bf g,3 + f g,4 bf g,4 bf g,4i ,

where the boundary-to-boundary coecients b, are 16 orthogonal combinations of the
cp multiplicities and , are signs. the solution of the inhomogeneous tadpole conditions

nf g, = 8 0,1 ,

nf g, = 8 0,2 ,

then requires that the nf g charges vanish identically and xes the signs 0,1 = 1 = 0,2
in the mobius strip amplitude.

in the direct channel, the annulus and mobius strip amplitudes can be cast into n =
2 supersymmetric extended characters, thus ensuring the vanishing of the cosmological

constant also in the open unoriented sector. introducing a minimal set of charges, these

amplitudes are

a = 2nn(0,1 + 0,2 + f g,3 + f g,4) + (n2 + n2)(0,3 + 0,4 + f g,1 + f g,2) ,

and

m = (n + n)(b0,3 + b0,4) + (n  n)(bf g,1 + bf g,2) .

the corresponding massless excitations are an n = 2 vector multiplet in the adjoint
representation of u(4) and one hypermultiplet in the 106 representations. the reduction
of the rank of the cp gauge group is due to the presence of a rank four antisymmetric

tensor in the denition of the so(12) lattice [17].

7. conclusion

in this paper we studied open descendants of non-supersymmetric type iib compact-

ications with zero cosmological constant. the construction of the parent closed string

theory is based on a freely acting orbifold that resembles an asymmetric scherk-schwarz

deformation. whereas supersymmetry is broken in the bulk, the open sector remains

supersymmetric at all mass levels. an interesting open question concerns the radiative

corrections induced by the non-supersymmetric bulk in the supersymmetric open string

spectrum. in particular, it would be interesting to understand the magnitude of the in-

duced mass splittings, and whether these splittings preserve the property of the vanishing

vacuum energy.

a possible application of the constructions discussed here is to models with a low

string scale and supersymmetry breaking by large dimensions [31,32,21]. an immediate

limitation, however, is that these constructions allow only one free internal dimension,

since four of them are xed at the fermionic point, while the fth one determines the

scale of supersymmetry breaking in the bulk. one possibility within this limitation is, for

instance, to take the compactication scale of the fth dimension close to the string scale

at intermediate energies, in such a way that the (gravitationally) induced mass splittings

19

on the brane are of the order of a tev. this may be possible by adjusting the size of the

remaining (free) transverse dimension, that can be as large as a millimeter, implying a
string scale as low as 108 gev. furthermore, in order to avoid large (linearly divergent)

corrections to the eective eld theory, one should impose local tadpole cancellation, that

leads to additional constraints in model building [10]. new possibilities, however, may

arise if some of the four xed internal radii are liberated in more general constructions.

in the context of type ii theories with low string scale [33], it is also interesting to study

the closed string models with vanishing vacuum energy at special points of moduli space,

where non-perturbative gauge symmetries appear. in particular, one should understand

the eects of supersymmetry breaking in the non-perturbative gauge sector of the theory.

in this work, we argued that supersymmetry remains unbroken for the massless excitations

to lowest order, by analysing the partition function of the heterotic dual. these models

are particularly attractive since the induced non-perturbative cosmological constant will

be exponentially suppressed in the weak coupling limit.
