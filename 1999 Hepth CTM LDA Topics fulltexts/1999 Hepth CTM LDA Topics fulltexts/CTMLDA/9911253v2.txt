abstract

we describe a simple method for generating new string solutions for which the brane
worldvolume is a curved space. as a starting point we use solutions with ns-ns charges
combined with 2-d cfts representing dierent parts of space-time. we illustrate our
method with many examples, some of which are associated with conformally invariant
sigma models. using u-duality, we also obtain supergravity solutions with rr charges
which can be interpreted as d-branes with non-trivial worldvolume geometry. in particular,
we discuss the case of a d5-brane wrapped on ads3  s3, a solution interpolating between
ads3  s3  r5 and ads3  s3  s3  r, and a d3-brane wrapped over s3  r or
ads2  s2. another class of solutions we discuss involves ns5-branes intersecting over a
3-space and ns5-branes intersecting over a line. these solutions are similar to d7-brane
or cosmic string backgrounds.

1. introduction

branes whose worldvolumes are curved spaces have widespread applications in string
theory, m-theory and in studies of four- and ve-dimensional black holes. in particular,
they have been used to identify the non-perturbative states of strings in lower dimensions
in various compactications. however, in most cases the branes wrapped over curved
spaces were treated as probes and their back reaction on spacetime geometry was ignored.
this is a consistent procedure for d-branes which are wrapped on various homology cycles
at small string coupling but in general this is not the case. another application of branes
with curved worldvolume, or curved branes for short, is in scenarios where the 3 + 1
dimensional universe is regarded as a brane moving in a higher dimensional space-time.
in particular, in some models one can introduce gravity localized on the brane and study
gravitational collapse. cosmological models have also been investigated in this context.

our aim is to provide a systematic method to construct such solutions. for this
we begin with congurations that have ns-ns charges only. the advantage of starting
with ns-ns congurations is that the conformal invariance of the associated sigma models
can be used to check the consistency of the backgrounds in string theory.
in this way
we construct a large number of congurations that can be interpreted as curved branes.
we nd that many of these curved brane congurations are limits of intersecting brane
congurations possibly superposed with plane waves and kk-monopoles. the curved
brane congurations can thus be constructed from the elementary solutions of the ns-ns
sector which are associated with conformally invariant sigma models. these include the
following:

(a) the plane wave [1].
(b) the fundamental string (t-dual to plane wave) [2,3] .
(c) the ns5-brane [4] associated with a generic harmonic function.
(d) the kk-monopole [5] (or kk 5-brane t-dual to the ns5-brane) and many other

hyper-kahler metrics in four and eight dimensions.

the exactness of most of the above solutions in string theory is based on the ultra-
violet niteness of (4,q)-supersymmetric two-dimensional sigma models [6,7]. there is an
associated smeared solution for many of the above congurations. this mostly applies
to plane wave, fundamental string, ns5-brane and kk-monopole all preserving 1/2 of the
maximal spacetime supersymmetry. the smearing is achieved by choosing the harmonic
functions for these solutions to be invariant under some translational isometries, i.e. to
be harmonic in a subspace of the transverse space of the original solution. the smeared
solutions share the conformal invariant properties of the generic solutions.

the above elementary solutions can be directly superposed to construct other solu-
tions which preserve various fractions of spacetime supersymmetry. all these solutions are
associated to intersecting m-brane congurations [8,9]. this can be achieved in various
ways, using, for example the harmonic function rule of [9] or the calibration methods of

1

[10]. the simplest solutions of that type are branes localized in all common transverse
dimensions, but, in general, one can localize the brane of a lower dimension in the one of
a higher dimension (the lower-dimensional brane satises the laplace equation in curved
geometry of the higher-dimensional brane [11]). some of the combinations that are known
to be conformal to all orders in  are the following:

(a) the fundamental string superposed with a plane wave [3].
(b) the fundamental string/ns5-brane system, the ns5-brane superposed with a
plane wave [12,11] and various t-dual congurations which include the fundamental
string/kk-monopole and the kk-monopole superposed with a plane wave.

(c) the direct sum of two ns5-branes [13] and the intersection of two ns5-branes on

a line.

(d) intersecting ns5-branes at sp(2)-angles on a line and toric hyper-kahler metrics

in eight dimensions [14,15].

these are mostly the solutions that preserve 1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetries,
apart from the last case which consists of solutions that preserve at least a fraction 3/32.
an alternative way to constructing solutions, which leads to a broader class of solu-
tions, can be obtained by curving the transverse space of a plane wave or a fundamental
string by putting there any cft with correct central charge and solving the corresponding
curved space laplace equations for harmonic functions. this general point of view and
examples are already discussed in [3,11]. in the case of the ns5-brane, one can also curve
the six worldvolume directions of the ns 5-brane or those of the kk monopole by putting
there any cft with the required central charge. for example, this can be achieved using
a wzw model (possibly with a linear dilaton to preserve the value 6 of the central charge
of the internal space), or a plane wave or a fundamental string localized on the ns5-brane,
or, to leading order in , any ricci-at space of dimension 1+5.

from the above solutions of the ns-ns sector one can easily nd, using s- and t-
dualities, many others which have rr charges. this is in parallel to the construction of the
d5+d1 solution which was found [16] by applying s-duality to the previously known n s5+
n s1 conguration [11]. in particular, this will lead to new curved d-brane solutions in ten
dimensions. the eleven-dimensional counterpart of such solutions will be generalizations
of m2 and m5 solutions having curved internal and/or external parts.

to summarize, the key advantage of the approach based on starting with an ns-ns
solution is that one does not need to solve the supergravity equations directly. in fact, one
can use simple cft composition rules in ns-ns sector and then apply t- and s- dualities.
in addition, the supersymmetry of some of the resulting solutions is easy to show in the
sigma model framework.

applying this method, we will nd new solutions that include d-branes wrapped over
a group space or a coset space. for example, we will show that there is a curved d5-brane
solution with worldvolume ads3  s3 (with an extra rr 2-form background). another

2

example is a curved d3-brane with the world-volume being the nappi-witten [17] space
or the 4-d null coset of [18]. in addition, we will nd a euclidean curved d3-brane with
worldvolume r  s3 and with linear dilaton.

we shall also consider smeared ns5-branes, ns5-brane intersections on 3-dimensional
space or on a line and a similar intersection with one ns5-brane replaced by a kk-
monopole. many of these solutions are determined by harmonic functions on a two-
dimensional transverse space. apart from the smeared ns5-branes, such solutions and
their u-duals are solutions to the leading-order in  and they can be obtained from known
m5-brane intersecting solutions [8,9,19] by dimensionally reducing to type iia d=10 the-
ory along an overall transverse direction.1 such solutions will be shown to admit a certain
complex structure, and they are similar to the cosmic string solution of [21]. consequently,
their overall transverse directions can be curved using the freedom of choosing the harmonic
functions in two dimensions. the d7+d3 bound state is u-dual to the intersecting ns5-
brane conguration on a 3-dimensional space. a question that remains open is whether
the d7+d3 bound state is an exact string solution.

2. brane solutions with curved internal and transverse space

2.1. the ansatz

from the ns-ns sector branes, the fundamental string and plane wave are the natural
starting points for constructing solutions with curved transverse space, while the ns5-
brane and the kk monopole are more appropriate for nding brane solutions with curved
worldvolume. to describe the conguration that describes both possibilities in the ns-ns
sector, we consider an eight-dimensional manifold m with metric ds2, dilaton  and closed
three-form h. then we write the ansatz [11]

ds2 = 2g1

1 du(dv + a + g2du) + ds2 ,

(2.1)

h = du  dv  dg1

1 + du  d(g1

1 a) + h ,

e2 = g1

1 e2  ,

where g1 and g2 are functions on m associated with the fundamental string and the plane
wave, respectively, a is a (locally) dened one-form on m associated with a rotation of
the string. in this ansatz, the ns5-brane solution and possible ns5-brane intersections or

1 the multiple ns5-brane conguration intersecting over a 3-dimensional space can also be
obtained, by smearing and u-duality, from a combination of a fundamental string and a plane

wave [20]. however, although the latter denes a conformal sigma model, the u-dual congurations
may receive higher order -corrections.

3

any other ns-ns background that allows a fundamental string superposition are described
by the geometry of m . to nd the string backgrounds described by this ansatz, we
either substitute (2.1) into the supergravity eld equations or use the conformal invariance
of sigma models to investigate the consistency of the propagation of a string probe. the
former coincides with the leading order approximation in  of the latter. the supergravity
killing spinor equations for (2.1) were investigated in [22] and many new supersymmetric
solutions were given.

the dynamics of a string probe in the ns-ns background (2.1) is described by a

two-dimensional sigma model with lagrangian

l10 = g1

1 [u v + aau xa + g2u v] + abxa xb

(2.2)

+ babxa xb + r(

1
2

logg1 + ) ,

where r=r(2). the vanishing of the beta-functions in the leading order in  gives

a(e2 abbg1) = 0 ,
b(e2 f ba) 
hace hb

ce + 2ab  = 0 ,

rab 

1
4

a(e2 abbg2) = 0 ,

(2.3)

e2  h bcafbc = 0 ,

1
2

a(e2  h abc) = 0 ,

where

fab = 2[aab] ,

ds2 = abdxadxb .

these are precisely the eld equations of the common sector of supergravity theories
adapted to the ansatz.

2.2. conformal curved branes

some of the solutions described by the ansatz above are exact to all orders in . to
give some examples, we begin with the ns5-brane background for which the associated
sigma model is [4] ( = 0, 1, ..., 5; m, n = 1, ..., 4)

l10 = l(0)

6 (x) + l4(y) = x x + (h5mn + bmn)(y)ym yn + r(y) ,

(2.4)

e2 = h5(y) = 1 +

p
y2 ,

db = dh5 .

this is a conformal model because the interacting part l4 admits (4,4) two-dimensional
supersymmetry [6]. the same applies to many parallel ns5-branes for which h5 is a
generic harmonic function on r4

.

4

next, we can replace the 6-dimensional at minkowski worldvolume directions of the
ns5-brane with any conformal sigma model with the same central charge. it is clear that
the new sigma model will be again conformal. some examples are:

(1) a plane wave propagating in the ns5-brane world-volume (i = 1, 2, 3, 4)

l6 = u v + g2(u, x)du2 + ai(u, x)u xi + xi xi ,

(2.5)

where g2 is a harmonic function, e.g., g2 = k = 1 + q
x2 . with this choice of g2 the
plane wave is localized on the worldvolume of ns5-brane but it is not localized along its
transverse directions.

(2) a wzw model with central charge c = 6. in particular, one can take the la-
grangian l6 to be that of sl(2, r)  su (2) wzw model which in supersymmetric case
has the same c as the free six dimensional theory. other examples include the r1,2su (2)

wzw model with linear dilaton in a spatial direction or some (super)cosets.

(3) the nappi-witten [17] wzw model supplemented with a free cft of two scalars.
(4) in general, l6 is allowed to depend on the transverse coordinates of ns5-brane.
for example, the function g1 in (2.1) associated with the fundamental string is allowed to
depend on worldvolume x and transverse y coordinates [11]. in particular, we get

l10 = g1

1 (x, y)u v + xi xi + (h5mn + bmn)(y)ym yn + r ,

(2.6)

where h1 = g1 satises

e2 = h5(y)g1

1 (x, y) ,

[2

y + h5(y)2

x]h1(x, y) = 0 .

(2.7)

there are many solutions to this equation. one is that of a string smeared over the
ns5-brane but localised in transverse directions,

g1 = h1 = 1 +

q
y2 ,

which is the standard case, and another is of a string localised on ns5-brane but smeared
in all of the transverse directions,

g1 = h1 = 1 +

q
x2 .

this latter case is t-dual to wave on the ns5-brane example mentioned above.

(5) another choice is a magnetic eld on the brane, based on the cft investigated

in [23]. it is a solvable 2-d theory dened by the lagrangian (i = 0, 1, 2)

l6 =   + f ()2(cid:2) + (b1 + b2)y(cid:3)(cid:2)  + (b1  b2) y(cid:3)

5

+ y y + xi xi +

1
2r log f , ,

(2.8)

where

f =

1
1 + b2

22 .

here b1, b2 are constants, y is a periodic coordinate of radius r, and ,  are polar coordi-
nates. the model describes a magnetic ux tube in a melvin-type geometry. the curvature
of the geometry is caused by the magnetic eld energy density. there are two magnetic
elds, corresponding to the u (1) u (1) gauge elds associated to the components gy and
by. the ux lines are conned to a radius   1/b2 and   1/b1, respectively. although
there is no residual supersymmetry, the sigma model is conformal to all orders in .

(6) a ns5-brane placed on the worldvolume of the original ns5-brane. the most
general solution of this type is the one constructed in [15,10] with the interpretation of
ns5-branes intersecting on a line at sp(2) angles. the corresponding 2-d sigma model
has at least (4,0) supersymmetry, depending on the choice of rotational parameters, and
therefore is nite to all orders in . however, it may still receive  corrections produced
by nite counterterms which one needs to add to ensure cancellation of sigma model and
supersymmetry anomalies [7]. in the special case of real rotational parameters, the sigma
model supersymmetry is (4,4) and the background does not receive  corrections.

the above list can be enlarged by solutions which solve the supergravity equations
only to leading  order. in particular, one can take any ricci-at 1+5 dimensional space,
i.e.

l6 = g (x)x x ,

rg

 = 0 .

solutions of that type were discussed in [24,25,26,27]. a particular class of them contains
various four-dimensional hyper-kahler metrics supplemented with the two-dimensional
minkowski space. such backgrounds are exact cfts.

2.3. conformal branes with curved transverse space

in order to nd brane solutions with curved transverse space, it is convenient to begin

with the fundamental string solution

l10 = g1

1 (x)u v  1

2r ln g1 + l(0)

8 (x) ,

l(0)
8 = ya ya .

(2.9)

then we can substitute the at transverse directions with some cft. for example, the
su (2) wzw model with linear dilaton, or ns5-brane and others. the explicit expression
for g1 is then found to the leading order in  by solving the eld equations (2.3) which in
this case reduce to

a(cid:0)abe2 b(cid:1)g1 = 0 .

6

some explicit examples involving wzw-type backgrounds were discussed [3]. to the lead-
ing order in , the transverse part can be replaced by any ricci at metric, leading to the
following background

ds2 = g1
btx = g1
1
r
ab = 0 ,

1 (y)(dt2 + dx2) + ab(y)dyadyb ,

,

e2 = g1 ,

a(abb)g1(y) = 0 .

(2.10)

another class of solutions can be obtained to the leading order in  by taking the transverse
space to be the conguration of ns5-branes intersecting at sp(2) angles on a line [15]. to
the same order, such solutions can be superposed with a plane wave and rotation giving
an even larger class of backgrounds [22].

2.4. brane solutions generated by u-dualities

using t- and s-dualities we can construct congurations with both ns-ns and r-r
charges from the solutions of the previous sections which have only ns-ns charges. this
method is well known and we shall not present an exhaustive catalogue of all possibilities.
instead, we shall present a few examples. applying s-duality transformation to the model
(2.4) with the longitudinal part given by any of the models l6 in section (2.1), one obtains
a curved d5-brane solution. for example, if we choose the wave model (2.5), we nd
a solution describing a d5-brane with a wave localized on it. other similar d-brane
solutions can be constructed by applying t-duality. for example, if we assume that g2 = k
depends only on u and xa = (x1, x2) but not on zk = (x3, x4) (i.e. it describes a wave in
four dimensions smeared in the other two), thgn t-duality along x3, x4 gives a d3-brane
solution with a wave localized on it (with the whole conguration smeared in the two zk
directions). the metric is given by

ds2

10 = h

1/2
5

(y)[dudv + k(u, x)du2 + dxadxa] + h 1/2

5

(y)[dzkdzk + dyndyn] .

similarly, s-duality applied to the solution (2.6) gives a d5 brane with d1 localized on it,
i.e.

ds2

10 = h

1/2
5

(y)[h 1

1 (x)dudv + dxsdxs] + h 1/2

5

(y)dyndyn .

a p1 brane within a p-brane, with p1 < p, can also be constructed by u-dualities. the
solutions for these composite branes have the following generic form

ds2 = h 1/2

p

(r)(cid:2)h 1/2

p1

(r)(dt2 + dx2
+ h 1/2
p1 (r)h 1/2

p

1 + ... + dx2
(r)(cid:0)dr2 + r2d2

p1 (r)(cid:0)dr2 + r2d2
p1 ) + h 1/2

(r)h (p13)/2

p1

(r) , hp(r) = 1 +

7

f8p = q 8p ,

fpp11 =  pp11 .

(2.13)

this solution is valid for p  p1 = 4, p1 < 3.

one can also construct curved dp-brane solutions of the form

ds2 = h 1/2

p

(y)g(x)dxdx + h 1/2

p

(y)hmn(y)dymdyn

(2.14)

where hp(y) is an harmonic function in the curved space ds2
is transverse to the brane, and g (x), hmn(y) are ricci-at metrics,

9p = hmn(y)dymdyn, which

rg

 (x) = 0 ,

rh

mn(y) = 0 .

(2.15)

analogous solutions can be constructed in eleven-dimensional supergravity. in particular,
the following background represents a curved m5-brane:

ds2

11 = h 1/3(r) g(x)dxdx + h 2/3(r)(cid:0)dr2 + r2d2
4(cid:1) ,

(2.16)

dc3 = 6q4 , h(r) = 1 +

q
r3 , rg

 = 0 .

when the metric (2.16) has translational isometry, this background can be connected to the
previous backgrounds upon dimensional reduction and suitable u-duality transformations.
we would like to emphasize, however, that the cases with ricci at longitudinal and/or
transverse spaces are just a small subclass of more general backgrounds. these more
general congurations describe various interesting cases which include branes on group
spaces, brane black holes and cosmological models with non-constant dilaton.

3. some particular cases

3.1. d5-brane wrapped on ads3  s3

one example is d5-brane wrapped on ads3 s3. this solution can be obtained by an
s-duality transformation applied to the ns5-brane model described in the previous section,
with worldvolume l6 given by the sl(2, r)  su (2) wzw model.

an alternative derivation, which is also useful for further generalizations, can be given
ns, with metric, 2-form and dilaton given by [28]

by starting with the system 1ns + 5ns + 5

ds2 = g1

1 (x, y)(cid:0)  dt2 + dz2(cid:1) + h5(x)dxndxn + h

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

which corresponds to the dyonic string generalization [29] of the 5ns + 5ns solution
of [13]. dierent choices of the harmonic functions give a number of interesting models;
related solutions have been discussed in [14,30,31,32,22].

to continue, let us further choose h 

1 = 1, in which case the solution is just a direct
product of ns1+ns5 conguration and another ns5-brane. then we use the fact that
the near-horizon limit of the ns1+ns5 conguration is simply the sl(2)  su (2) wzw
theory [11]. explicitly, as x  0, the metric (3.1) becomes

ds2 =

x2
r2

(dt2 + dz2) + r2

dx2
x2 + r2

1d2

3 + h 

5(y)(cid:0)dy2 + y2d

3

2(cid:1) ,

(3.6)

where we have set for simplicity h1 = h5. the resulting sigma model describes a curved
ns5-brane with worldvolume ads3 s3 and denes an exact cft. applying s-duality, we
obtain the type iib solution representing a curved d5-brane with worldvolume ads3  s3
space. the associated metric is

ds2 = h

(3.7)

which is supplemented with the obvious dilaton and rr 2-form backgrounds.

the above solution may have applications to the study of the decoupling limit of branes
wrapped on curved spaces. other solutions can be constructed by applying t-duality along
isometric directions of ads3  s3.
3.2. d1-d5-d5 system with ads3  s3  s3  r horizon geometry

construction of another example requires to begin again with (3.1),(3.4) but now
choose h1 = h5 and h 
5  r, see also
[30]. now we take the near-horizon limit y  0. rescaling the coordinates, the metric
becomes

5 in which case r1 = r5  r and r

1 = h 

1 = r

ds2 = h 1

(3.8)

since the dilaton is constant, the s-dual metric describing a d1-d5-d5 system is the same
as (3.8). the corresponding rr 2-form eld strength is given by (3.2).

the solution (3.8) interpolates between the two exact conformal models, as it is easy

to show. indeed, as x  , the metric approaches that of ads3  s3  r4. for x  0,

the metric takes the form

ds2 =

u2u2

r2r2 (dt2 + dz2) + r2 du2

u2 + r2 du2

u2 + r2d2

3 + r2d

3

2 ,

(3.9)

where we have rescaled the coordinates. introducing new variables y and x by

u = r exp(cid:2)

u = r exp(cid:2)

we get

ds2 = e

r0 (dt2 + dz2) + dy 2 + dx 2 + r2d2

3 + r2d

2 .

(3.10)

this is a direct product of the 3-dimensional anti-de sitter space of radius r0, the two
3-spheres with radii r and r, respectively, and a real line (parametrized by x). string
theory on such space and its duality to 2-d superconformal theories was investigated in
[33]. similar models like that of ads3  s3  s3  s1 were recently studied also in [34].

3.3. d3 brane wrapped over non-trivial 4d spaces

it is straightforward to nd the solution representing a d3 brane wrapped over a

ricci-at space. in the decoupling limit of [35], we obtain (r2 = 4gsn ,  = 1)

ds2 =

r2

r2 g (x)dxdx + r2 dr2

r2 + r2d2
5 ,

(3.11)

with constant dilaton e = gs and rg
 = 0. the metric is of the form x5  s5, where
x5 is an einstein space having a ricci at four-manifold with metric g as a boundary.
type iib superstring theory on this background (3.11) should be dual to a n = 4 su (n )
yang-mills theory on a four-dimensional manifold described by g [36].2

like the d5 brane, the d3 brane can be also wrapped over non-ricci-at spaces with

longitudinal space to be some hyper-kahler manifold, for which various properties of the instanton

moduli space are known.

in particular, for certain ale spaces, or k3, exact information is

available for any su (n ) [37]. the partition function z could then be compared with the string

theory partition function on this background.

where h = 1+r4/r4. it represents a monochromatic gravitational wave, which travels in a
direction parallel to the d3 brane (though it is not localized on the brane). a simple check
of consistency of this solution is to smear it in two transverse directions and to apply t-

is obviously a solution being s dual to direct product of ns 5-brane and the nwr2
the d3-brane can also be wrapped over ads3  r space with linear dilaton in the
spatial direction (upon smearing in the two transverse directions and u-duality the corre-
sponding ns model is the direct product of the ns 5-brane model with the sl(2) r r2

clidean d3 brane may be wrapped over s3  r space with a linear dilaton along spatial
direction to make total central charge of the longitudinal theory equal to its standard

let us now construct a d3 brane wrapped over ads2  s2. this is related to the d5
brane wrapped on ads3  s3 by t-duality along isometric directions of ads3  s3, but
it can also be constructed directly from an exact conformal model as follows. we start
with the conformal -model representing the intersection of an ns 5-brane, a kaluza-klein
monopole (with kaluza-klein coordinate x2), a fundamental string, and a wave along the
string direction x1 [12]. the ns and kk 5-branes lie on the directions x1, x3, x4, x5, x6.
t-duality in x2 exchanges their charges. in four dimensions, this background leads to the
dyonic bps black hole (which contains the reissner-nordstrom solution as a particular
case). let us consider the case when all four charges are equal. the near-horizon geometry
, the ads2  s2 part of the space being described by the coordinates
in order to incorporate a d3 brane wrapped on ads2s2, we start with this conformal
sigma model in the horizon limit ads2  s2  r6
. we add an ns 5-brane lying along
the space (x1, x2, x7, x8, x9). the transverse part of this extra brane is thus the at space
(x3, x4, x5, x6), so that the resulting metric is given by

3.4. d2-brane on s2

many of the solutions that we have presented above contain the metric of an odd-
dimensional sphere s2n+1. in all such cases, one can use the hopf bration s1  s2n+1 
cp n and perform t-duality along s1 in a way similar to that of [38]. it turns out that
for d-brane backgrounds in the dual picture the hopf bration untwists and the sphere is
replaced by cp n.

for an application, let us consider the solution (3.12), (3.13). this is a euclidean d3
brane wrapped on s3. next we use the hopf bration s1  s3  s2, cp 1 = s2, to
obtain a solution with the interpretation of a euclidean d2 brane wrapped on s2. the
metric and dilaton of this background is

ds2

10b = h 1/2(cid:2)dz2 + r2

0d2

2(cid:3) + h 1/2(cid:0)d2 + dr2 + r2d2
5(cid:1) ,

e2 = e2z/r0h 1/2 .

(3.17)

the eleven-dimensional supergravity solution representing an m2 brane wrapped on s2 is
then constructed by applying the usual formula of dimensional reduction.

4. solutions with 2-dimensional transverse space

now we are going to consider a dierent class of ns-ns solutions which are determined
by functions which depend on two variables. many examples of such solutions have the
interpretation of intersecting branes with a two-dimensional overall transverse space. we
can either curve the worldvolume directions of the branes involved in the intersection or the
overall transverse space. the investigation of the former case is similar to that presented in
the previous section and we shall not repeat the analysis. in the latter case we rst remark
that any two-dimensional metric is conformal to the at one and that in two dimensions
there is a freedom of dening harmonic function by adding the real part of a holomorphic
one. a product of these harmonic functions is the conformal coecient of the overall
transverse space. as we shall see, making dierent choices for the harmonic functions,
we eectively curve the overall transverse space of the conguration. this phenomenon
is similar to what happens in the case of the cosmic string background [21]. in fact, we
shall nd that one of our solutions reduces to that of the cosmic string. as a byproduct of
our analysis, we shall give two examples of calabi-yau metrics with holonomy su (3) and
su (4), respectively.

12

4.1. single smeared ns5-brane

let us start with a ns5 brane solution smeared in two transverse dimensions. as we
have already mentioned, this is an exact conformal model just like the standard ns5 brane.
in particular, we smear the directions {a; a = 1, 2} = (x3, x4) and keep the dependence
of the solution on the coordinates {xi; i = 1, 2}.
in such case, the ns-ns 3-form eld
strength is

(4.1)
next, we consider a holomorphic function h = h + ib of z = x1 + ix2 that solves
 h = 0,  = /z. then

(db)12i = ij jh ,

iih = 0 .

ih = ij jb ,

and so the non-zero 2  2 components of bmn can be chosen as

bab = abb .

(4.2)

the resulting ns5 brane sigma-model can be written as

l = t t + yn yn + (hab + bab)(x)a b + h(x)xi xi + 1

2r ln h(x) .

(4.3)

note that

(hab + bab)(x)a b  1

2 [h(z)   + c.c.] ,

where  = 1 + i2. since the torsion in two dimensions is trivial, i.e. adding bij = ij b(x)
gives a total derivative which we can drop, we can write this in a complex form
l = t t + yn yn + 1
2r ln h(x) . (4.4)
this background is related, via t-duality, to the d7 brane one [39], and, via compactica-
tion  to cosmic string geometry of [21]. more specically, t -duality along a spatial 5-brane
direction gives the iib ns5 brane; s-duality and t-duality along a gives the d7-brane.
a are directions of 2-torus with trivial complex structure, and the background modulus
eld is eab = hab + bab, or

2 [h(z)(   + z  z) + h(z)(   +  z z)] + 1

 = 1 + i2 = b + i(det gab)1/2 = ih ,

e2 = h = 2 .

t -duality along one of the a directions gives the corresponding smeared version of the kk
monopole:

l = t t + yn yn + h 1(x)[1 + b(x)2][ 1 + b(x) 2]

+ h(x)2 2 + h(x)xi xi ,

or

l = t t + yn yn + h 1(x)|1 +  (x)2|2 + h(x)xi xi ,

(4.5)

(4.6)

where the modulus of the two-torus is  = b + ih = . compactifying to four dimensions,

this reduces indeed to the model of [21], i.e. t 2  r2

.

13

4.2. ns5-brane and kk monopole

one can also start with the conformal model describing ns5 brane + kk monopole

which is smeared in one transverse direction, say y = x3. then we nd that

l = t t + yn yn + h1(x)h 1
2 (x)(cid:2)z + a3(x)x3(cid:3)(cid:2) z + a3(x) x3(cid:3)
+ h1(x)h2(x)(x3 x3 + xi xi) + b3(x)(z x3  zx3) + r(x) ,

iih1 = iih2 = 0 ,

ib3 = ijjh1 ,

ia3 = ij jh2 ,

(4.7)

where i = 1, 2 and we have made a natural special choice of the two-form gauge potential.
we can further identify b3 and a3 with the imaginary parts of the holomorphic functions
h1 and h2 that have h1 and h2 as their real parts.

this background is u-dual, in particular, to d6 + ns5 conguration with one isometric

direction, or to d7 + kk-monopole.

4.3. intersecting ns5 branes

let us now consider the solution of two ns5 branes intersecting on a 3-dimensional
space and localized only in the overall two transverse directions. the corresponding m-
theory solution is that of m 5m 5 [8,9] smeared in the 11-th transverse direction. the
ns5-brane system is related, by an s-duality and a chain of two t-dualities, to a d3-
brane on a d7-brane conguration. this is 1/4 bps state and the solution is given by
the harmonic function rule. the solution is smeared in all eight common directions and
depends only on the two overall transverse directions. the sigma model action for this
ns5-brane conguration is

l = t t + ys ys + (hab + bab)(x)a b

+ (h ab + b ab)(x)a b + h(x)h (x)xi xi + r ,
where s = 1, 2, 3, a, b = 1, 2, i = 1, 2, and the dilaton is e2 = h(x)h (x).

(4.8)

in general, h and h  are two arbitrary real functions that solve the 2-d laplace

equation, while b is determined by

(db)12i = ij ih ,

(db )12i = ijih  .

(4.9)

to put the action in the above simple local form we made the assumption that h and h 
are real parts of the two holomorphic functions h, h, and used the same considerations as
above for a single ns5-brane smeared in two directions (which is an obvious special case
h  = 1) to determine the antisymmetric tensor in terms of imh = b and imh = b .

14

we remark that the 5ns5ns solution with a dierent special choice of h and h  (such
that h + ih  is a holomorphic function) was considered in [40].

the resulting action has a remarkably simple structure

l = t t + yn yn + 1

2(cid:18)[h(z)   + h(z)  ] + c.c.(cid:19)

+ 1

2 h(x)h (x)(z  z + c.c.) + 1

2r ln[h(x)h (x)] ,

(4.10)

where z = x1 + ix2,  = 1 + i2,  = 1 + i2 and n = 1, 2, 3.3 a special choice is
h = q ln z, h = q ln z, so that h = 1

2 i ln(z/z), and similarly for b .

2 q ln|z|2, b = 1

the corresponding type ii supergravity background, or the associated m-theory con-

guration, preserves 1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetry. this can be seen using the
holonomy of the associated connections (). for this we introduce the complex struc-
tures i(d) = id, i(d) = id, i(dz) = idz and j(d) = id, j(d) = id, j(dz) = idz.
these complex structures are integrable since they are constant. a direct computation re-
veals that (+)i = 0 and ()j = 0 which implies that the holonomy of () is a subgroup
of u (3). in fact, it turns out that the holonomy of both connections is su (3). using this

one can conclude that the solution indeed preserves 1/4 of the supersymmetry. as a con-

sequence, the sigma model (4.10) admits a (2,2)-supersymmetric extension. this amount

of supersymmetry by itself is not, however, sucient to prove that this sigma model is

nite to all orders in perturbation theory since the argument of [6] does not apply. it may

nevertheless be an exact cft due to the simple form of the action.

another consequence of the su (3) holonomy is that these metrics are associated with

calabi-yau ones. in particular, let us t-dualize twice, once along the  and once along

the  coordinates. using, the results in section (4.1), we nd that

l = t t + yn yn + h 1(x)|1 +  (x)2|2

+ h 1(x)|1 +  (x)2|2 + h(x)h (x)xi xi ,

(4.11)

where  = ih and   = ih. the non-trivial part of the sigma model action is associated
with a six-dimensional non-compact calabi-yau metric.

3 compactied to 3 dimensions this background gives a black hole solution with several scalars

(cf. [41]).

15

4.4. three ns5 branes intersecting on a line

the metric of the supergravity solution of three ns5 branes pairwise intersecting on

three-dimensional spaces, and all  on a line, is

ds2 = dt2 + dy2 + h1dd  + h2dd + h3dd + h1h2h3dz dz .

(4.12)

here , ,  and z are complex coordinates and h1, h2, h3 are harmonic functions in the
overall transverse space spanned by (z, z). this solution may be viewed as a reduction of
m 5  m 5  m 5 background in eleven dimensions [8,9]. performing similar calculations
as in the previous cases, the sigma model action is found to be

l = t t + y y + 1

2(cid:18)[h1(z)   + h2(z)   + h3(z)  ] + c.c.(cid:19)

+ 1

2 h1(x)h2(x)h3(x)(z  z + c.c.) + 1

2r ln[h1(x)h2(x)h3(x)] ,

(4.13)

where h1, h2, h3 are holomorphic functions of z. the above solution preserves 1/8 of the
spacetime supersymmetry, as can be seen by studying the holonomy of the connections
().
in particular, the holonomy of both connections is su (4). the corresponding
bosonic sigma model admits a (2,2)-supersymmetric extension which again is not enough
to establish that the model is conformal using the argument of [6].

as in the previous case, the above ns5-brane geometry is associated to an eight-
dimensional calabi-yau one. indeed, using t-duality in three directions chosen in a way
similar to that of the previous example, we nd

l = t t + y y + h 1
+ h 1
+ h1(x)h2(x)h3(x)xi xi ,

2 (x)|1 + 2(x)2|2 + h 1

1 (x)|1 + 1(x)2|2

3 (x)|1 + 3(x)2|2

(4.14)

where 1 = ih1, 2 = ih2 and 3 = ih3. the calabi-yau metric is given by the
non-trivial part of the sigma model action.

5. conclusions

we have obtained brane solutions with a curved worldvolume by starting with confor-
mal two-dimensional sigma models describing the propagation of strings in ns-ns back-
grounds. the advantage of this method is the simplicity and transparency of the con-
struction of brane solutions. many of the solutions that have already appeared in the
literature [24-27] can then be easily derived by dualities, without solving any dierential
equations. one of the main points of the present discussion is that branes with a ricci-at

16

worldvolume constitute only a special case of a more general class of congurations. the
worldvolume of a brane can be any suitable cft, which may describe non-ricci at spaces
with non-constant dilaton and non-vanishing 2-form eld strengths. in particular, we have
presented examples of the solutions representing branes wrapped over group spaces.

further progress in constructing interesting curved brane solutions is related to the
undestanding of the back reaction of branes wrapped on homology cycles of compact spaces
in string and m-theory compactications. it is clear from our results that apart from the
topological information about the cycles one also needs some geometrical data. in some
situations the geometry of the normal bundle of the cycle will also be relevant.4

4 in this paper we have assumed an orthogonal decomposition between the worldvolume and
the transverse spaces. in general, if one wraps a brane over a cycle one may not have an orthogonal

decomposition in the metric because the normal bundle of the cycle can be twisted. examples of

such solutions were discussed in [42].
