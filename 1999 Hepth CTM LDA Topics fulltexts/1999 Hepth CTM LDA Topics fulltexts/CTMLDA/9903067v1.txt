abstract

using the spectral representation approach to the zamolodchikovs c-function and the
maldacena conjecture for the d1-branes, we compute the entropy of type iib strings.
an agreement, up to a numerical constant which cannot be determined using this
approach, with the bekenstein-hawking entropy is found.

in two dimensional eld theories, the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor
is a useful concept in studying the relation between the energy and the entropy. for conformal

theories, they completely determine the entropy [1]. this fact, together with the observation
of brown and henneaux [2] that the asymptotic group of ads3 yields a two dimensional

conformal theory, was used by strominger to derive the bekenstein-hawking entropy for
black holes in ads3 [3].

in this note we study the sym theory in 1+1 dimensions with gauge group su(n) and
sixteen supercharges which is a non-conformal theory. this theory can be thought of as the

theory living on a collection of n d1-branes in the low energy decoupling limit. in the
extreme uv the theory is free and conformal with central charge

perturbation theory in sym can be trusted in the uv as long as the eective coupling
constant is small, that is

cu v  n 2.

where x is the scale being probed by the two point function. in the deep ir region, the

physical energy scale determined by the coupling constant becomes irrelevant and the theory
ows to a conformal theory. in [4, 5] this theory was shown to be a conformal -model with
the target space (r8)n /sn whose central charge is

note that cu v > cir as expected from the zamolodchikovs c-theorem [7]. the rst correction

theory with respect to the twist operators breaks down at x <
[8, 9, 10]. a simple
argument which rests on the c-theorem is the following. perturbation theory around the
conformal point will break down when the dierence between the zamolodchikov c-function
and cir is of the order of cir. that is, when htzz(x)tzz(0)i is of the order of htzz(x)tzz(0)i.
conservation of the energy-momentum tensor implies that (see e.g. [11])

in the large n limit there is a large region,

(6)

for which neither the perturbative sym nor the orbifold cft description can be trusted.

in [9] it was shown that this region is best described by the type iib string theory on
a background associated with the near horizon geometry of d1/f1 strings. exactly at

the points in uv and the ir regions where the perturbative eld theory descriptions break
down, the curvature (in string units) is small so that the supergravity approximation becomes
reliable. the transitions between the perturbative conformal theories (at the uv and ir) and

the supergravity description were studied in [12, 13, 14] to nd a match from both sides up to
a numerical coecient which cannot be determined using current methods. this agreement

(for the entropy [12, 14] and for the wilson line [13, 14]) supports the maldacena conjecture
for this non-conformal theory but it does not give us much information about the way in

which the supergravity description interpolates between the uv and the ir perturbative
eld theories descriptions.

in this article, we elaborate on the interpolation of the zamolodchikovs c-function be-
tween cir and cu v and its relation to the entropy of the near-extremal d1/f1 string. to
make contact with entropy it is useful to use the kallen-lehmann spectral representation of
the correlator of two energy-momentum tensors [15],

ht(x)t(0)i =



3 z

.

(7)

the fact that the zamolodchikovs c-function is monotonically decreasing along the rg
ow follows from c()  0 which must hold for any unitary theory [15]. in two dimensions,
covariant quantity with four indices subject to the constraint following from the conservation

of energy momentum-tensor is characterized by a single invariant. thus, there is only one
possible function of the intermediate mass scale, c(), which is known as the spectral density.

the quantity

d c(),

(8)

interpolates between cir = cef f (0) and cu v = cef f (). since c()d measures the density
of degrees of freedom which couple to the energy-momentum tensor, and since all elds
couple to the energy-momentum tensor, the spectral representation of the correlator of two
energy-momentum tensors measures the density of degrees of freedom.

using the methods developed in [16, 17] to compute eld theory correlation functions via
the bulk propagation of supergravity modes, we can calculate the two point function of the

energy-momentum tensor. suppressing numerical factors and lorentz indices, we nd

ht (x)t (0)i =

n 3/2
gy m x5 .

(9)

before substituting this into eq.(7) and discussing the spectral density, it is worth while to
make a few comment about this result. eq.(9) is obtained by repeating the procedure of

[16, 17] for the minimally coupled scalar in the near horizon geometry of the d1-brane. in
non-conformal theories it is harder to identify the correspondence between the supergravity
modes and the eld theory operators since the symmetry group is smaller (see however

[18]). general covariance indicates that the energy momentum tensor must correspond to
the metric uctuation h. it is therefore more appropriate to analyze the eld equations for
metric uctuations in this background. we expect nonetheless for the generic components
of the metric uctuations to behave essentially like a minimal scalar. the reason is that h

mixes with a linear combination of a minimal and xed scalar1 [19]. in the supergravity region
the xed scalar contribution is suppressed and we are left with eq.(9) for htzz(x)tzz(0)i.
all other components are determined in two-dimensions by the conservation of the energy-
momentum tensor.

there are corrections to (9) suppressed by

which can be thought of
respectively as curvature and quantum corrections from the point of view of type iib string

and xgy m

theory in the near horizon geometry of the d1-brane. these corrections are very small
and can be ignored in the region given by eq.(6) where supergravity approximation can be
trusted. conversely, the point in x-space where these corrections become signicant mark

the transition point to the uv and ir conformal xed points. at these transition points,
between supergravity and perturbative sym and between supergravity and the orbifold

cft, eq.(9) agrees (up to a numerical factor) with the conformal results

ht (x)t (0)i =

c
x4 ,

(10)

for the central charge appropriate for the uv and ir xed points given in eqs.(1,3). in order
to x the numerical coecient of eq.(9) unambiguously, it may be necessary to understand

the supergravity-perturbative sym crossover in detail so that the normalization in the su-
pergravity region can be matched to the normalization in the perturbative sym region. for

our purpose, however, there is no need to x the numerical constant since the relation be-

1strictly speaking, these elds are scalars in the 9 dimensional supergravity obtained by dimensionally

reducing along the spatial direction of the d1-brane.

tween the spectral density and the entropy can be determined only up to a numerical factor
as we discuss below.

combining eq.(9) with eq.(7) we nd that c() = n 3/2/gy m . therefore, for a given

temperature t , the number of light degrees of freedom with p2 < t 2 is

nef f ( t )  cef f ( t ) =

n 3/2 t
gy m

.

(11)

here we encounter a fundamental ambiguity:
the relative numerical coecient between
cef f ( t ) and nef f ( t ) cannot be determined for non-conformal theories2 (as opposed to con-
formal theories where nef f = cef f ). in fact, one can construct two theories with the same
cef f whose nef f agrees only up to a numerical factor of order one.

the contribution to the free energy is

hence the energy density and entropy density are

we wish to compare this with the black hole thermodynamics. in the einstein frame the

(15)

which is in agreement, up to a numerical factor, with eq.(13).

note that unlike in the near horizon geometry of d5+d1 branes, the eld theory describ-

ing string theory in the near horizon geometry of d1-branes is known in details:
it is the
sym in two dimensions. however, our calculation did not rely on the detailed properties

of the sym action at all. what we did instead was to use the supergravity dual to com-
pute a eld theory quantity, the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor. then,

using rather general eld theory arguments which are valid for any unitary eld theory in
two dimensions, we compute the entropy to nd an agreement with the bekenstein-hawking

formula. this agreement serves as a check of maldacena conjecture for d1-branes [9].

it is interesting to note that in the supergravity region the entropy energy relation is

similar to that of a gas of a free massless scalar eld in (2+1) dimensions. in the extreme
uv and ir, on the other hand, this theory behaves like a free gas in (1+1) dimensions (with a
dierent number of eld, since cu v > cir). amusingly, this general behavior is mimicked by
the following simple statistical mechanical model. consider n free elds in (2+1) dimensions
which propagate on a semi-lattice. by semi-lattice we mean a chain of n continuous
strings with lattice spacing a. so the size of the system is l1l2 where l1 is an ir cuto
which we can take to innity and l2 = na. the dispersion relation for this system is

2 = k2

1 +

a2 sin2(k2a/2),

k2 = n/l2,

n = 0... n .

(16)

in the ir where the thermal wave-length is larger than l2, the contributions from the extra

dimension are negligible and we have the entropy of a free massless gas in two dimensions.
in the uv where the thermal wave-length is smaller than a,  can grow only due to k1 as k2

is restricted to a single brillouin zone. therefore, the entropy is that of a free massless gas
in two dimensions where the number of massless elds is nn  as can be read from eq.(16).3
to have an agreement with eq.(1) we set n = n. in the intermediate region the system
behaves like a gas of n free particles in (2+1) dimensions. to match with the number of
degrees of freedom of 1+1 dimensional sym in the deep uv and ir, we set a =

3the elds are not exactly massless as can be seen from eq.(16). rather their masses are bounded by
1/a which is much smaller then the temperature so their contribution to the entropy at large temperature
is similar to the massless elds contributions.
