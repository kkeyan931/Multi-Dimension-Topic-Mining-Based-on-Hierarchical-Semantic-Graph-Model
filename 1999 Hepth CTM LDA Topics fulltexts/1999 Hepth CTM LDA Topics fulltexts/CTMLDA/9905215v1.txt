we derive a generalized skyrme-faddeev action as the eective action of qcd in the low energy
limit. our result demonstrates the existence of a mass gap in qcd which triggers the connement
of color.

recently faddeev and niemi have discovered the
knot-like topological solitons in the skyrme-type non-
linear sigma model [1], and conjectured that the skyrme-
faddeev lagrangian could be interpreted as an eective
lagrangian for qcd in the low energy limit [2]. the pur-
pose of this letter is to derive the eective action of qcd
from the rst principles. based on the parametrization of
the gluon potential which emphasizes its topological char-
acter, we derive a generalized skyrme-faddeev action as
the eective action of qcd in the infra-red limit. in do-
ing so we demonstrate the existence of a mass gap which
generates the dual meissner eect and triggers the con-
nement of color in qcd. our result establishes a deep
connection which exists between the skyrme-faddeev
type non-linear sigma model and qcd, and strongly en-
dorses the idea that the knot solitons of faddeev-niemi
type could play an important role in qcd.

it has long been argued that the connement of color
in qcd could take place through the dual meissner ef-
fect [3,4]. but a rigorous derivation of an eective the-
ory of qcd which could demonstrate this conjecture has
been missing so far [5,6]. to obtain the desired eec-
tive theory of qcd it is important to understand the
mathematical structure of the non-abelian gauge the-
ory. a characteristic feature of the non-abelian gauge
theory is its rich topological structure manifested by the
non-abelian monopoles [7,8], the  -vacuua and the in-
stantons [9,10]. so it is crucial to make sure that these
topological characters are properly taken into account in
the eective theory. to be specic consider su (2). here
the relevant topology is the 2(s2) which describes the
non-abelian monopoles, and the 3(s3)  3(s2) which
describes the multiple vacuua and the corresponding vac-
uum tunneling by instantons. to take into account the
above topology one needs to introduce a cp 1 eld, or
equivalently an isotriplet unit vector eld n, in the the-
ory. this can be done with a natural reparametrization
of connection which contains the topological degrees ex-
plicitly [4,5]. with the reparametrization one can obtain
the eective theory of qcd by integrating out all the

dynamical degrees of the non-abelian gauge theory.

consider su (2) for simplicity. a natural way to ac-
comodate the topological degrees into the theory is to
decompose the connection into the abelian part which
leaves n a covariant constant, and the remaining part
which forms a covariant vector eld [4,5],

~a = an 

1
g
= a + ~x,

n   n + ~x

(n2 = 1),

(1)

where a = n  ~a is the electric potential. notice
that the abelian projection a is precisely the connection
which leaves n invariant under the parallel transport

d n =  n + g a  n = 0.

under the innitesimal gauge transformation

n = ~  n ,  ~a =

1
g

d~,

one has

a = n  ~,

 a =

1
g
 ~x = ~  ~x.

d~,

(2)

(3)

(4)

notice that a still describes an su (2) connection which
enjoys the full su (2) gauge degrees of freedom.

with (1) one has

~f = f + d ~x  d ~x + g ~x  ~x

= (f + h + x)n + d ~x  d ~x,

(5)

where

f = (f + h )n,

f = a  a, h = 

1
g

n  ( n   n),

x = gn  ( ~x  ~x).

(6)

1

notice that h with n = r describes the wu-yang
monopole [7,8]. since  h = 0 except for the iso-
lated singularities of n, one can introduce the mag-
netic potential c for h.
indeed with n =
(sin  cos , sin  sin , cos ), one nds

h = c  c, c = 

1
g

cos .

(7)

clearly c describes the diracs monopole potential
around the isolated singularities of n .

now the yang-mills lagrangian can be expressed in

terms of a and ~x,

steps, rst obtain the eective action of the restricted
gauge theory by integrating out ~x, and then obtain the
eective action for the topological eld n by integrating
out the remaining a. before we perform the integral, it
is important to notice that there are two types of gauge
transformations one can consider, the active type and the
passive type. this is because one could treat n either as
a covariant multiplet or simply as a xed background.
the rst view provides an active type described by (3),
but the second view provides the following passive type

n = 0,

 ~a =

 a =

(11)

clearly it can be viewed as the restricted gauge theory
made of the abelian projection

l(r) =

with this we now calculate the eective action in one-
loop approximation.

(9)

to perform the d ~x integral we rst x the gauge

with the condition

which has an additional gauge covariant charged vector
eld (the valence gluons) as its source. more importantly
the restricted gauge theory describes the dual dynamics
of qcd with the dynamical degrees of the abelian sub-
group u (1) as the electric component and the topological
degrees of su (2) as the magnetic component [4,5].

it must be emphasized that in the above parametriza-
tion n (or equivalently c) represents the topological de-
grees of the non-abelian theory which exist in addition to
the six dynamical degrees represented by the transverse
components of a and ~x [5,11].
in the conventional
analysis the topological degrees have often been neglected
because one could always make n trivial and remove it
from the theory by a gauge transformation, at least sec-
tionwise locally. but notice that, if one must include the
topologically non-trivial sectors into the theory, one can
not remove n by a smooth gauge transformation.

with these preliminaries we are ready to derive the
eective action of qcd. in principle we can obtain the
eective action expressed solely by the topological eld
n by integrating out all the dynamical degrees of qcd.
consider the generating functional for (8)

~f1 = ( d ~x)  ~f1 = 0,

lgf1 = 

1
2

( d ~x)2.

(12)

to obtain the corresponding faddeev-popov determinant
one must keep in mind that one has to keep a xed
to integrate out ~x. this means that one could treat
as if  ~x has the full su (2) freedom, even though it
has no n-component. so from (11) the faddeev-popov
determinant can be written as

m ab

1 =

f a

( dd)ab.

(13)

with this the generating functional takes the form with

w [ ~j, j] = z dad ~x exp[iz (

(10)

to remove the quartic term of ~x we introduce an auxil-
iary antisymmetric tensor eld  and express the quar-
tic term as

in the functional integral we have to integrate out the
six dynamical degrees with a proper choice of a gauge,
leaving n as a background. here we will do it in two

but here we will choose a simpler condition

(17)

the integration over the auxiliary antisymmetric eld
can be performed for the trivial classical congurations

approximation using the dimensional regularization, and
those involving only divergent parts are given by

with this condition one obtains the following faddeev-

(24)

so the resulting eective lagrangian for the restricted
qcd is written as

now one can integrate a from (20) with (22) and (24),
and with  = 1 we obtain the following lagrangian,

(25)

this is precisely what one could have expected. indeed
with a as the background one can easily argue that the
eective action of the restricted gauge theory must have
the above functional form, because it must be invariant
under the gauge transformation (3) of the background
eld a. so the only possible modication of the action
from the ~x integral is the overall renormalization of the
eld strength f given by (19).

now consider

w [j] = z da exp [iz (

z1

f 2
 + aj)d4x].

(20)

we have to integrate out the electric degrees a from
the restricted qcd to obtain the eective action for n.
for this it is crucial to remember that the restricted the-
ory still has the full su (2) gauge degrees of freedom,
even though it contains only the dynamical degrees of
the abelian subgroup. this means that we have to x
the full su (2) gauge degrees of a to integrate out a.
now one could x the gauge with the condition

 a = a n + a n

n  2n = 0.

(21)

where  is a mass scale. so after the renormalization
procedure the nal eective lagrangian can be written

(26)

this completes the derivation of the eective action of
qcd from the rst principles.

a few comments are in order now. first, we have
integrated out ~x and a separately in two steps, to
emphasize the importance of the restricted qcd. but
certainly one could integrate out them simultaneously in
one step, to obtain the desired eective action [12]. sec-
ondly, it appears that we have over-exploited the gauge
degrees of freedom in the above calculation. this is not
so. with the introduction of n, one can actually view
(3) and (10) as independent, which together give us an
extended su (2)  su (2) gauge degrees of freedom [12].
thirdly, one might certainly be tempted to go further
and decompose n into the classical and quantum parts,
and integrate out the quantum part of n to obtain the

3

h as well as the topological degrees of g, and the gauge
covariant part which consists of the dynamical degrees
of g/h. the abelian projection denes the restricted
gauge theory which describes the dual dynamics of g,
and the covariant vector eld plays the role of the col-
ored source of the restricted theory [5,11]. the eective
action is obtained by integrating out all the dynamical
degrees of the non-abelian gauge theory.

a more detailed discussion, including the gauge de-
pendence of the eective action and the generalization to
su (3), will be discussed in a forthcoming paper [12].

eective action. but we emphasize that it suces to in-
tegrate out only the dynamical degrees of qcd for us
to obtain the desired eective action [12]. finally, the
eective action that we have derived is not exactly the
skyrme-faddeev action. the skyrme-faddeev action is
unique in the sense that it consists of all infra-red rele-
vant and marginal (and lorentz invariant) interactions of
n which are at most quadratic in time-derivative, which is
necessary for a hamiltonian interpretation of the theory
[2]. our eective action contains the extra interactions
which are not quadratic in time-derivative. whether this
should cause any serious problem or not is not clear at
this moment, which need to be studied further [12].

the most important feature of our analysis is the ap-
pearance of the kinetic term of the topological eld n.
this teaches us the following lessons. first this tells
that the topological eld n can be treated as a dynami-
cal (i.e., propagating) eld after the quantum correction.
remember that in the parametrization of the gauge con-
nection (1) one can not treat n as a dynamical eld, be-
cause it simply represents the topological singularities
of the point-like non-abelian monopole at the classical
level [11]. with the quantum correction, of course, one
should count (not only the dynamical degrees but also)
the topological degrees as the true physical degrees of
the non-abelian gauge theory. secondly and perhaps
more importantly this demonstrates the existence of a
mass gap in qcd. in fact from the dimensional analysis
the kinetic term automatically introduces a mass scale to
qcd which could naturally be interpreted as the conne-
ment scale. the generation of the mass scale comes from
the dynamical symmetry breaking, which should induce
the magnetic condensation and the dual meissner eect
responsible for the connement of color in qcd [4,5].

we conclude with the following remarks:

1) with the eective action at hand one could verify the
conjecture that the knot solitons could describe the glue-
ball states of qcd explicitly. for this one must rst ask
whether the eective action of qcd allows the knot solu-
tions of faddeev-niemi type. the answer, most probably,
should be in the armative. if so, one could really try
to test experimentally whether qcd contains the topo-
logical knot solitons as the glueball states.
2) our analysis conrms that it is the restricted qcd
which plays the central role in the connement of color
[4,11]. it has all the non-abelian characters of qcd, with
the -vacuua and the non-abelian monopoles. with the
decomposition (1) the valence gluons ~x become a col-
ored sources which one can add to (or remove from) the
theory at ones disposal, and is not likely to play any im-
portant role in the connement mechanism.
3) a generalization of the above analysis to an arbitrary
group g should be straightforward. the connection can
be decomposed into the abelian part which consists of
the dynamical degrees of the maximal abelian subgroup
