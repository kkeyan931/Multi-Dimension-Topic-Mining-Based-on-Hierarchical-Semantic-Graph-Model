abstract

the complete two-loop correction to the quark propagator, consisting of the
spider, rainbow, gluon bubble and quark bubble diagrams, is evaluated in the non-
covariant light-cone gauge (lcg), naa(x) = 0, n2 = 0. (the overlapping self-energy
diagram had already been computed.) the chief technical tools include the powerful
matrix integration technique, the n
-prescription for the spurious poles of (q n)1,
and the detailed analysis of the boundary singularities in ve- and six-dimensional
parameter space. it is shown that the total divergent contribution to the two-loop
correction 2 contains both covariant and noncovariant components, and is a lo-
cal function of the external momentum p, even o the mass-shell, as all nonlocal
divergent terms cancel exactly. consequently, both the quark mass and eld renor-
malizations are local. the structure of 2 implies a quark mass counterterm of the

s), es  g2()(4)2, with w depending

form m(lcg) = mescf (3 +esw ) + o(e3

only on the dimensional regulator , and on the numbers of colors and avors. it
turns out that m(lcg) is identical to the mass counterterm in the general linear
covariant gauge. our results are in agreement with the bassetto-dalbosco-soldati
renormalization scheme.

1 introduction

a quarter of a century ago the light-cone gauge was a gauge to fortune and to fame
unknown. it was regarded as a freakish member of the family of axial-type gauges
that existed more by accident than by inventive planning [1]. today, the light-
cone gauge enjoys respect and a privileged status among noncovariant gauges for
the following two reasons: rst, computations in the light-cone gauge have proved
to be meaningful, both at one and two loops. second, the renormalizability of
light-cone qcd, as demonstrated in this article, has nally been established at
two-loop order by explicit computation. specically, we shall discuss here in some
detail the renormalization of the quark propagator to two loops in the light-cone
gauge naa = 0, n2 = 0, where aa
 denotes the gauge eld and n = (n0, ~n) is an
arbitrary, but xed, four-vector,  = 0, 1, 2, 3 [2]. the diagrams for this process are
depicted in figure 1. we note that the results for the one-loop quark self-energy
function (fig. 1f) and for the overlapping self-energy function (fig. 1b) have already
been reported in the literature [3, 4]. these two diagrams are included here for
completeness.

whereas computation of fig. 1f was straightforward, at least in hindsight, eval-
uation of the overlapping quark self-energy [4, 5] required the introduction of a new
procedure, called the matrix integration technique. we recall that in this procedure,

the two momentum integrals of r d2qr d2kf (q, k), where 2 denotes the complex

dimensionality of space-time, are integrated over 4-dimensional space in a sin-
gle operation. we further recall that the biggest advantage of the matrix method
is the ability to execute the momentum integrations exactly and in closed form.
with the momentum integrals conveniently out of the way, we can then concen-
trate on the wide variety of new parameter singularities which is so characteristic
of noncovariant-gauge multi-loop integrals.
it turns out that the matrix method
enables us to handle these new parameter singularities in a consistent and unam-
biguous manner. by comparison, multi-loop integrals with fewer and less severe
parameter singularities may, in general, be evaluated by means of the nested method
[4, 5, 6, 7]. in this traditional approach, the 2-momentum integrations are carried
out sequentially.

we nally observe that the matrix integration technique works for covariant
and noncovariant gauges alike, and regardless whether the integrals are massive or
massless. we shall have occasion later in this article to highlight specic technical
features of this powerful technique.

it is well known [8, 9] that in covariant gauges, qcd may be renormalized by a
redenition of the masses, coupling constants, and eld normalizations. however, for
noncovariant gauges, such as the light-cone gauge, the situation is more complicated:
in addition to the same types of counterterms that arise in covariant gauges, for
light-cone qcd we also require n-dependent counterterms. these noncovariant
counterterms are dierent from any of the terms in the original lagrangian density.
on the other hand, and in contrast to the covariant case, no physical measurements
are needed to x the nite parts of these new noncovariant counterterms. instead,
the nite parts are constrained by the requirement that all physical observables
be lorentz-covariant. in a sense, the presumption of covariance of the observables
constitutes an innite set of physical constraints on the noncovariant counterterms.

in 1987, bassetto, dalbosco, and soldati (bds) [10, 11] proposed a renormal-
ization scheme for light-cone qcd in which the particular types of noncovariant
counterterms  permitted by gauge symmetry and lorentz symmetry  are absorbed
into the original lagrangian density by means of noncovariant renormalizations of
the quark and gluon elds. unlike the covariant-gauge case, where the renormaliza-
tion factors are scalars, in the bds scheme the renormalization factors are matrices.
the result is that the dierent spin-components of the quark and gluon elds are
renormalized dierently. the present two-loop calculations are a clear vindication
of the bds renormalization scheme.

the plan of paper (ii) is as follows. in section 2 we derive the integrands of the
light-cone integrals for the various diagrams of figure 1, and then break them down
into approximately 80 simpler integrands. in section 3 we illustrate, by means of
examples, methods for handling the various integrations. the explicit values for
the divergent parts of all integrals are tabulated in the appendix. these results
are analytic and allow for general quark masses. the counterterms needed for the
renormalization of the quark self-energy to two loops in the light-cone gauge are
derived in section 4.
it turns out that all required counterterms are local (that
is, polynomial in the external momentum), and that their coecients satisfy the
relationships implied by the bds renormalization scheme. the paper concludes in
section 5 with a summary of our results and their signicance.

repeated indices imply summation, and we use a +, , ,  metric for minkowski
space.

2.1 the feynman rules

the lagrangian (1) leads to the following feynman rules for light-cone qcd [11,
12, 13]:

quark propagator:

is(p), with

s(p) 

p/ + m

p2  m2 + i

,

 > 0,

(2)

where p is the quark 4-momentum,  and  are color indices as in (1), and the i
term is feynmans prescription for avoiding a singularity when p2 = m2. (we let 
go to zero after wick rotation.)

gluon propagator:

iabg(q), with

g(q) 

1

q2 + i g 

nq + qn

nq

q2qq

(nq)2 ! ,

+

 > 0,

(3)

where q is the gluon 4-momentum. the gauge-xing parameter  is now taken to
zero, causing the third term in parentheses to drop out.

quark-quark-gluon vertex factor:

igt a

.

3-gluon vertex factor:

gf abc[(p  q)g + (q  k)g + (k  p)g], where

p, q, k are the incoming 4-momenta of the attached gluons.

4

4-gluon vertex factor: ig2[f abef cde(gggg)+f acef bde(gggg)+

f adef cbe(gg  gg)].

ghost propagator:

ab/(nk), where k is the ghost 4-momentum.

ghost-ghost-gluon vertex factor: igf abcn, where  and a match indices of
the attached gluon, while b and c match indices of the attached ghosts. note that
ghosts decouple in the light-cone gauge, because the ghost-ghost-gluon vertex
factor is orthogonal to the gluon propagator (3) when  = 0 [14, 1].

counterterm vertex factors:

to be determined in section 4.

to construct the dimensionally regularized green function for a diagram, we
rst impose conservation of momentum at each vertex, so that, apart from external
momenta, there is only one independent momentum per loop. (in figure 1, these
momenta are denoted by q and k.) we then form the product of the propagators
and vertex factors for all internal lines and vertices, divide by (2)2 for each loop,
and integrate the resulting expression over the 2-dimensional space of each loop
momentum. finally, we multiply the integral by 1 for each internal quark loop,
divide by r! for each pair of vertices connected by r gluon lines, and also divide by the
number of permutations of the vertices which leave the diagram invariant (for xed
external lines) [11, 15]. in figure 1, only diagram e (quark-bubble) has an internal
quark loop, only diagram d (gluon-bubble) has a pair of vertices connected by more
than one gluon line, and no diagram is invariant under a non-trivial permutation of
its vertices.

the procedure just described gives only the amputated green function, since

it includes no factors for the external lines of the diagram.

2.2 the integrals and the n

-prescription

to illustrate the application of the above feynman rules, we may immediately write
down the amputated green function for the one-loop diagram of figure 1f:

1(p) =

g2t a

t a


(2)2

zm

s(p  q) g(q) d2q,

(4)

where rm denotes integration over minkowski space, and s and g are the propaga-

tors dened in equations (2) and (3) (with  = 0, and m equal to the rest mass of
the external quark). to avoid a singularity in g when nq = 0 (in this and other
integrals), we shall use the n

-prescription (ml-prescription) [16, 2], in which
nq

 is a new light-like 4-vector (n2 = 0), with nn > 0 in minkowski space,

qk

,

q  q  qk

(6)

for any 4-vector q. the same prescription applies to (n k)1, with the same n
,
but with k in place of q. prescription (5) was subsequently recovered in the context
of canonical quantization by bassetto et al. [17]. unlike the old principal value
prescription, the n
-prescription is consistent with both wick rotation and power-
counting [1, 7, 11, 12].

the amputated green functions for the ve two-loop diagrams of figure 1 possess

the following structure:

where ml is the rest mass of the quark in the inner loop of figure 1e.

the rst step in the evaluation of integrals ia to id is to substitute for s and g
from equations (2) and (3), and expand the numerator of each integrand into a sum
of products. in order to avoid terms whose integrals diverge as q  0, the quark-
bubble integral ie will be handled dierently from the other integrals, as discussed
in section 3.2.

before integrating, we simplify the integrals by applying wick rotations. this

procedure is valid because both feynmans i prescription as well as the n
lead to poles in the second and fourth quadrants only. in this way, the integral (4),
for instance, becomes

-prescription

1(p) =

ig2t a

(2)2

! ,

where ,  = 1 . . . 4, q0 = iq4, p0 = ip4, n0 = in4, 0 = i4, and re denotes

integration over the euclidean space spanned by q1 . . . q4.

2.3 expansion, reduction, transformation, and tadpoles

from the feynman rules, we see that green functions in general are integrals of
rational functions of the loop momenta. for integrals ia to id above, it would
appear that some terms in the numerators of the integrands could have degrees as
high as 11 in q and k together (after up to four applications of the n
-prescription
(5)). fortunately, however, we may reduce the maximum degree to ve, and in most
cases to three, by means of cancellations between terms within each integral, and
between numerator and denominator factors within many of the terms. because of
the large number of terms involved, some computer assistance is advantageous.

expanding the numerator of each integrand into a sum of products, and then
following the procedure outlined in paper (i), we obtain a list of well over 100 distinct
terms to be integrated. fortunately, we can shorten this list still further by applying
transformations, such as k  q  k, q  q + k, and/or q  k, to selected terms.
the transformation q  q + k, for instance, yields

(nq  nk)(q  k)2[(p  q)2 + m2]k2 

n/

n/

nq q2[(p  q  k)2 + m2]k2 ,

where the expression on the right just happens to be already on the list of terms to
be integrated. notice that the factor (nq  nk) can thus be eliminated from all
denominators.

having carried out these various cancellations and transformations, we nd that
some of the integrands factor into separate q and k dependent parts. in some cases,
one of these two one-loop integrals vanishes, since its integrand is antisymmetric
under q  q or k  k.
in many other cases, one of the one-loop integrals

7

corresponds to a massless tadpole, and likewise vanishes in the context of dimensional
regularization [18, 19].

2.4 power counting

for renormalization, we require only the divergent parts of integrals ia to ie, so we
shall drop all terms whose integrals can be shown by power counting to converge
when  = 2. for a covariant gauge, weinbergs theorem [20, 15] tells us that a feyn-
man integral is uv-convergent if its integrand, including the measure d4q d4k . . ., is
of negative degree with respect to every non-empty subset of the loop momenta
q, k, . . .. we have the same rule for the light-cone gauge, except that we must also
consider subsets that include only the transverse part  the part orthogonal to n
 of one or more of the loop momenta [11].

to illustrate power counting, consider the euclidean-space integral

z z

n/ np d2q d2k

nq[(p  q)2 + m2](q  k)2(nq  nk)[(p  k)2 + m2]

,

(8)

arising from the spider diagram (figure 1c). when  = 2, the integrand has degree
2 in q, 1 in k, and 0 in q and k combined. hence, by the rule given above,
this integral may be divergent. as it turns out, however, this particular integral is
actually convergent, because the leading-order part of the integrand for large |q| and
|k| is antisymmetric under q3  q4, k3  k4 (we have taken n1 = n2 = n
2 = 0
for simplicity, so that qk = (0, 0, q3, q4) and kk = (0, 0, k3, k4)). there are other
such borderline integrals which are convergent for the same reason.

1 = n

in the appendix we have summarized the divergent terms which remain to be
integrated, for each of the integrals ia to ie. we have also listed there the various
integrated divergent parts for each individual term.
in the next section we shall
demonstrate how these results were obtained.

3 integration methods

several dierent approaches to the evaluation of multi-loop feynman integrals ap-
pear in the literature [6, 7, 21, 22, 23]; they will not be reviewed here.
in most
methods, one begins by writing the denominator of the integrand as an integral,
using a parametrization formula. we shall use the formula known as schwingers
representation:

1
1 f v
2 . . .

f u

= z 

0

u1

1 d1
(u)

z 

0

v1

2 d2
(v)

. . . exp(cid:16)  1f1  2f2 . . .(cid:17).

(9)

8

the factors f1, f2, . . . must have positive real parts; hence, before using formula
(9), we apply the n
- prescription to any factors of nq and nk in the denominator,
perform wick rotations, set  to zero, and take the factor(s) nn from eq. (5) outside
of the integral. the component p4 of the external momentum is regarded as real
until after integration has been completed.

3.1 the nested method

after parametrization, it is necessary to integrate over both the loop momenta and
the parameters. the question of the most suitable order for these integrations
naturally arises. to take advantage of known one-loop results, we might try the
nested method, in which we integrate rst over one of the loop momenta (k, say),
then over the parameters associated with factors involving k, then over the other
momentum q, and nally over the remaining parameters.

as an example, consider the divergent euclidean-space integral

i1 = z z

n/ d2q d2k

nq[(p  q)2 + m2][(p  q  k)2 + m2]k2 ,

(10)

arising from the overlapping and rainbow diagrams. applying formula (9) to the
k-dependent factors only, we obtain

i1 = z n/ d2q

nq q z 

0

d1z 

0

d2z d2k exp(cid:16)  1[(p  q  k)2 + m2]  2k2(cid:17),

where q  (p  q)2 + m2. next we change variables from 1, 2 to a  1 + 2 ,
x  1/a, and complete the square in the exponent to get

nq q z 1
i1 = z n/ d2q

0

dxz 

0

a daz d2k exp(cid:16)  a[(k  xp + xq)2 + h](cid:17),

(11)

with h  xh(1  x)(p  q)2 + m2i. the k and a integrations may then be carried

out with the help of the well-known gaussian and gamma integrals:

a(cid:19)
z exp (ar2) d2r =(cid:18) 

,

a > 0,

(12)

and

z 

0

adeah da =

(d + 1)

h d+1

,

h > 0, re d > 1,

(13)

respectively, with r = k  x(p  q) in this case. accordingly, we obtain

nq q z 1
i1 = ()z n/ d2q

0

dx h ;

9

  2  .

(14)

from power counting, we expect the k integral in eq. (10) to be well dened only
if  < 2. in fact, we required just this condition in order to complete the integration
(13) which produced the divergent factor () in eq. (14). the q integral in eq. (14)
also diverges as   0, according to power counting, so altogether we expect i1
to have a double pole at  = 0. this expectation will be conrmed by explicit
calculation.

before we can complete the integration, we must decide how to deal with the
q-dependent factor h  in eq. (14). since we expect i1 to have a double pole at
 = 0, and since we are only interested in nding the divergent parts, we might try
integrating only terms up to order  from the exponential series

h  = 1   ln h + 1

2( ln h)2  . . . ,

= 1   ln x   lnh(1  x)(p  q)2 + m2i + 1
= x +h(1  x)(p  q)2 + m2i

 1 + o(2).

2 ( ln x)2 + . . . ,

if we could drop the o(2) terms, we could immediately integrate over x, and then
complete the q integration from eq. (14). unfortunately, the series (15) cannot be
integrated term-by-term, since it does not converge uniformly with respect to q, as
explained in paper (i).

the convergence of series (15) is non-uniform partly because h goes to innity
as |q| goes to innity. one way of solving this problem is to factor out the large
|q| behaviour before using a series, provided we do so without either creating new
convergence problems, or generating terms that we cannot integrate. in the current
example, we can extract a factor of q from h before using the exponential series,
so that eqs. (15) to (17) become

with q  (pq)2 +m2. convergence of this new series remains uniform as |q|  ,
except near x = 0 and x = 1. fortunately, however, these remaining non-uniformities
cause no trouble, provided we integrate eq. (19) only. at x = 0, the x term
in this equation gives the correct contribution to the pole parts of i1, while the
contributions from the second and third terms in parentheses cancel. similarly, as
x  1, |q|  , the second term in parentheses gives the correct contribution,
while the contributions from the rst and third terms cancel. (one may check these

10

claims by using expansions in powers of x near x = 0, and 1  x near x = 1.) hence,
the o(2) term in eq. (19) does not contribute to the pole parts of i1.

integrating eq. (19) over x, and substituting into eq. (14), we nd that

i1 =

()

1   z n/ d2q

nq q "1 + 
q +

m2[q  (m2)]

(p  q)2

# + nite,

(20)

where nite refers to terms which do not diverge as   0. by power counting,
we see that the q integration in eq. (20) diverges only for the rst term in square
brackets. because of the divergent factor () in front, we need both the divergent
and nite parts of the q integral, but not parts of order . hence, we may set  = 0
in the convergent second term, causing this term to vanish (fortuitously). applying
the n

-prescription (5), along with the parametrization formula (9), we obtain

i1 =

 + y(1  y)p2

the 4-vectors pk, p, and so on, are dened in eqs. (6). note that npk = np,
pq = pkqk + pq, (pk) = 0, etc., for any 4-vectors p and q.

since t is an even function of r, we may drop the term with n r from the
integrand of eq. (21). we also drop np, which is equal to zero, and factor the r
integral into independent rk and r parts:

z y npk et d2r = y np exp(cid:16)  ayh(1  y)p2

k + m2i(cid:17)
k) d2rkz exp (ayr2

 z exp (ar2

) d22r.

the integrations over r, a, and y are then easily completed with the help of formulas
(12) and (13).

3.2 the quark-bubble integral ie

let us try the nested method on the integral in eq. (7). since the inner loop of
figure 1e involves no gluons, the integral over k of the k-dependent factors in (7) is

11

just the standard covariant-gauge result [15]:

zm

d2k

trace[(k/ + ml)(k/  q/ + ml)]
[k2  m2

0

(x  x2)[m2

l  (x  x2)q2]dx,

with  > 0 and   2   as before. the above equation is exact: no terms of
order  , or higher, have been omitted. (to verify this claim, one may use the trace
theorems [15] to obtain
trace [(k/ + ml)(k/  q/ + ml)] = 4g(m2
l  k2  qk) + 8kk  4qk  4kq,
and then carry out the k integration using some of the formulas and methods from
subsection 3.1.)

substituting the right-hand sides of eqs. (22) and (2) into eq. (7), we get

where d(q)  g(q)(q2g  qq)g(q), and m is the rest mass of the external
quark in figure 1e.
it follows from eq. (3) that d(q)  g(q) as ,  
0, so that ie is proportional to the one-loop integral (4), except for the extra x
integral within the q integral. we note that there is only one factor of q2 now in the
denominator (in d(q)), thereby preventing the integral from diverging as q  0.

us that integral (24) is well dened only if  > 0. under this condition, (q2) is a
decreasing, concave-up function of q2 (for q2 > 0), from which it follows that

0 < (q2)  l < (q2  l)

using this inequality, we can show by power counting that the dierence between

replacement and pull the factor (q2) out of the x integral. integrating over x with

and completing the q integration, we get the desired result. notice that the divergent
parts of ie will be independent of the mass of the quark in the inner loop, as ml
enters eq. (24) only by way of l.

3.3 review of the matrix method

as seen in the preceding examples, in the nested method one tries to modify the inte-
grand between the rst and second momentum integrations, in a way that simplies
the nal integration without changing the divergent parts of the result. particular
care must be taken with regard to the behaviour of the integrand near boundaries
where the nal integration diverges, such as |q|  , x  0 in the examples. the
greater the degree of divergence, the more closely the simplied integrand must
match the exact one. this requirement becomes more and more challenging as the
number of  parameters increases.

for integrals such as

i2 = zeze

nq [(p  q)2 + m2] [(p  q  k)2 + m2] [(p  k)2 + m2] k2 ,

q/ d2q d2k

(27)

in which both q and k appear in more than two denominator factors each, it is
easier to complete all momentum integrations before doing any parameter integra-
tions. this approach is called the matrix method [4, 5]. momentum integrations
are straightforward with this method, because the combined 4-dimensional mo-
mentum integral can be expressed as a derivative of a product of one-dimensional
gaussian integrals. in view of the importance of the matrix method for multi-loop
integrals, we shall briey review its main features.

after wick rotation and application of the n

-prescription, a two-loop light-
cone integral takes the form of an integral over q and k of a polynomial p (q, k),
say, divided by some non-negative quadratic factors f1, f2, . . .. application of the
parametrization formula (9) then yields

d1z 

= z 
d2k p (q, k) exp(cid:16)  1f1  2f2 . . .(cid:17).

(28)

(29)

since the exponent is quadratic in q and k, we can rewrite eq. (29) in the form

j[p (q, k)] = ze

d4z p (q, k) exp(cid:16)  zmz + 2bz  c(cid:17),

(30)

where m is a real 4 4 matrix, b and z are real 4-vectors, z  (k4, q4, k3, q3,
. . .),  denotes transpose, and the components of m, b, and c are functions of
1, 2 . . ., but not of q or k.

for any given set of f factors, one may obtain explicit expressions for the com-
ponents of m, b, and c by expressing the exponents from eqs. (29) and (30) in terms
of the components of q and k, and then equating corresponding coecients. for the

13

two-loop integrals of the appendix, with qk = (0, 0, q3, q4) and kk = (0, 0, k3, k4) as
before, we nd that

where the dots in m denote 2  3 repetitions of the third 2 2 sub-matrix, and
a(1  a), a, a, ag, ab, ah, and aa are the sums of the  parameters whose
k2
corresponding f factors include
k,
respectively. for example, if we label the denominator factors in integral (27) as f1
to f5 from left to right (after application of prescription (5), with 2nq/nn taken
into p ), we have for this integral

q2
, 2pq,

q2

2tqk, 2pk,

1  a = (1 + 2 + 3)/a,

t = 1,

h = a = (3 + 4 + 5)/a,

b = (3 + 4)/a,

g = 3/a,

c = (2 + 3 + 4)(p2 + m2) = a(b +   g)(p2 + m2).

the equations for a and 1  a tell us that a = 1 + 2 + 23 + 4 + 5.



(32)

(33)

since the matrix m is to be multiplied by z on both sides, it may always be
constructed symmetrically. accordingly, there exists a matrix r such that rmr is
diagonal and rr = 1. dening a new vector y so that z = yr + bm1, and taking
p = 1, we nd that eq. (30) becomes

j[1] = exp(cid:16)bm1b  c(cid:17)ze

|det r| d4y exp(cid:16)  yrmry(cid:17).

(34)

since the integral in this equation is just a product of 4 one-dimensional gaussian
integrals, we may use formula (12), along with |det r| = 1
det(rmr) = det m,

and qi(rmr)ii =

to get

j[1] = 2(det m)1/2 exp(cid:16)bm1b  c(cid:17).

(35)

notice that we never actually need to construct r. to nd j[p ] for general p (q, k),
we dierentiate eq. (30) partially with respect to bi to obtain j[p ]/bi = 2j[zip ],

14

and then apply this formula repeatedly to eq. (35) to get

j[zi] = tij[1],

j[zizj] = htitj + ( 1
j[zizjzk] = htitjtk + ti( 1

2 m1)ijij[1],

...

2 m1)jk + tj( 1

2 m1)ki + tk( 1

2 m1)ijij[1],

where t  bm1  (r4, s4, r3, s3, . . . ).



(36)

(37)

since the momentum integral j[p ] is a linear functional of p , and z  (k4, q4, k3, q3,
. . .), we can use the above equations to nd j[p ] for any polynomial p (q, k).

in order to derive the two-loop integrals summarized in the appendix, we sub-

stitute from eqs. (31) into eqs. (35) to (37) to obtain the following relations:

j[k] = rj[1],

j[q] = sj[1],

j[nq k] =  ns r 
j[nq q] =  ns s +

j[nq nk k] =  ns nr r +
a(cid:19)2

j[1] = (cid:18) 

and so on, where

from the denitions of the new parameters following eq. (31), one may show that
the sub-determinants dk and d satisfy dk  0, d  0 for all allowed values of
a, , h, and g, thereby justifying our use of formula (12) in the derivation of eq. (35).

for the integral (27), the polynomial p [q, k] is given by p = 2nqq//nn. since
h = a and  =  from eqs. (32), it follows from eqs. (38), (39), (41), (42), and (33)

3.4 parameter integration for the matrix method

once j[p ] is known for a particular integral, we must complete the parameter
integrations in eq. (28). for the two-loop integrals listed in the appendix, we begin
these integrations by changing variables from 1, 2, . . . to the applicable subset of
the new parameters , , g, b, h, a and a, dened after eq. (31). for the sample
integral (27), we nd from eqs. (32) that

z 

0

d1z 

0

d2 . . . j = z 1/2

0

dgz 1g

g

daz 1a

g

dz a

g

dbz

ja4da.

(46)

the integration ranges of the nite parameters , , g, b, h, and a depend on which
f factors are present in the original integral. for instance, if the factor containing
q + k in eq. (27) did not also contain p, the b integration in eq. (46) would run from
0 to a  g, rather than from g to a. in the event of a repeated f factor, there will
be an additional nite parameter which can be integrated out immediately, since j
will not depend on it.

we see from eqs. (43) and (45) that dk, d, and h are independent of a, so that
the a integration in eq. (46) is straightforward. applying formula (13) to eq. (44),
we obtain

z

j[p ]a4da =

nnh(1 + 2)j1 + (2)j0i;

.

(48)

note that the use of formula (13) requires h > 0. we can see that this requirement
is satised in general by examining the way in which h was constructed: since the
f factors and  parameters in eq. (28) are non-negative, we nd that the exponents
in (29) and (30) are  0 for all values of q and k. consequently, the sum of the
exponents in eq. (34) is  0 for all values of y. taking y = 0, and noting that a is
just a sum of  parameters, we see that h in eq. (42) is  0 for all allowed values
of the old or new parameters. furthermore, since r and s are independent of the
quark mass m, one can deduce from eq. (45) that h = 0 only if b +   g = 0
(m 6= 0). we emphasize that the relationship b +   g = 0 applies specically to
the integral (27).

16

the presence of the divergent factor (2) in eq. (47) reects the uv-divergence
of integral (27) with respect to q and k combined. additional divergences, known
as subdivergences, may be found when we complete the remaining integrations from
eq. (46), because j0 and j1 go to innity at the boundaries of the integration region
where a  0 and a  1 (corresponding to |k|   and |q|  , respectively). in
the current example, each of these boundaries has three fewer dimensions than the
full nite-parameter space, because from the limits of integration in (46) it follows
that

a  b  g  0

and

1  a    g  0.

(49)

thus, near a = 1, for instance, we could transform dgd to (1  a)2dxdy (with
x and y being nite parameters such that  = x(1  a) and g = y(1  a)). a
subdivergence can therefore occur at a = 1 only if the integrand j0 or j1 diverges
there at least as fast as (1  a)3.

from eqs. (43), (48), and (49), we nd that dk, d  0 linearly as a  1, while
the numerator of j1 goes to zero quadratically, and h remains positive unless b  0
as well (assuming m 6= 0, as discussed above). thus, we nd that j0 is of order
(1  a)3 near a = 1, b 6= 0, while j1 is of order (1  a)2 there. hence, by the
criterion given above, the integral of j0 over the nite parameters diverges as a  1
(and   0), while the integral of j1 does not. similar analyses at other boundaries
of the integration region (including the case a = 1, b = 0) show that there are no
other subdivergences in this example. since we are only interested in nding the
divergent parts of i2, and since j1 gives no subdivergences and is not multiplied by
a divergent gamma function in eq. (47), we may drop j1.

due to the factor (2) in eq. (47), the subdivergence in the integral of j0 will
contribute a double pole to i2, while the nite part of the same integral will con-
tribute to the single pole. the factor h 2 in eq. (48) complicates the integration
of j0, but some simplication is possible because this factor aects the pole parts
of i2 only by way of the subdivergence at a = 1. to begin the simplication, we
rewrite h 2 in (48) as 1 + (h 2  1), and then expand the factors, multiplying
the term (h 2  1), in powers of 1  a, , and g, using the denitions for dk and
d from eq. (43). in this fashion we obtain

j0 =

n/a
kd1



d2

+

n/(h 2  1)

(1  a)21 h1 + o(1  a, , g)i.

(50)

by counting powers of 1  a, , and g, we see that the integral of the term involving
(h 2  1)o(1  a, , g) has no subdivergence; to nd its nite part we therefore
can set  = 0 in this term (which happens to make it vanish). accordingly, we may

replace j0 by bj0(h),

bj0(h) 

n/a
kd1



d2

+

n/(h 2  1)
(1  a)21 ,

(51)

17

without aecting the divergent parts of i2.

the next step is to replace h in eq. (51) by

h1  lim
a1

h = b(p2 + m2)  b2p2,

where the result on the right follows from eqs. (45), (40), (43), (49), and from the
equality  =  in eqs. (32). to justify this replacement, we use the same kind
of reasoning that led to the inequality (25); in the present case, an appropriate
inequality is given by

0  |h 2  h 2

1

|  2|h  h1| (h 21 + h 21

1

),

which holds for all allowed values of the parameters. exploiting this new inequality,
and noting that |h  h1| goes to zero as a  1, and that both h and h1 go to zero

(linearly) only when b  0, we can show that the integral of bj0(h)  bj0(h1) , over

the nite parameters, has no subdivergence and vanishes when   0. in summary,
we can replace h by h1 in eq. (51) without aecting the divergent parts of i2.

making this replacement, and integrating over b in accordance with eq. (46), we

obtain

(52)

as a  1, the ranges of the second and third integrals in square brackets shrink
to points, so that these terms contribute no subdivergences to the total integral
over the remaining parameters. hence, in the derivation of the nite parts of the
integrals of these terms, we are allowed to set  = 0 in their integrand (causing it to
vanish). to facilitate the remaining b integration in eq. (52), we shall express h 2
in the form (cf. eq. (17)),

1

h 2

1

= [b(p2 + m2)  b2p2]2 = (p2 + m2  bp2)2 + b2  1 + o(2).

it now remains to integrate the factor multiplying the b integral in eq. (52) over
, a, and g, in accordance with eq. (46). but this task is easy: since the b integral
is of order , only the divergent part of the integral over , a, and g is needed.

finally, we must also integrate the rst term on the right-hand side of eq. (52)
over , a, and g, again in accordance with eq. (46). because of the factor (2) in
eq. (47), both the divergent and nite parts of this triple integral will be needed. we
begin the integration process by dening the new variables x = d/a2, y = dk/a2,
and v = g/a, so that

from the denitions of y, v, and dk, we nd that a2 = (y + v2 + 1)2. but
this factor can be simplied because it aects the divergent and nite parts of the
integral only at subdivergences. the subdivergence at a = 1 now manifests itself at
v = y = x = 0. near this point, we have

(y + v2 + 1)2 = 1  2(y + v2) + (1 + 2)(y + v2)2  . . . .

(53)

only the rst term of this series gives a subdivergence, so we may set  = 0 in the
other terms (causing them to vanish, as usual). away from the subdivergence, the
integral is nite, so we can take  = 0 in that region as well. thus, in the current
example, the factor a2 may be replaced by 1. the integrations over x, y, and v
pose no further problems.

for a subdivergence at a = 0, we would use

(y + v2 + 1)2 = y2h1  2(v2 + 1)/y + (1 + 2)(v2 + 1)2/y2  . . .i,

valid for large y. if the subdivergence comes only from the rst term in this series,
then a2 may be replaced by y2.

3.5 reduction of subdivergences

the subdivergence in integral (27) is of the mildest possible nature; that is, j0 goes
to innity only just fast enough to make the nite-parameter integral diverge as
a  1 and   0. for this reason, we were able to drop the o(1  a) term in
eq. (50), replace h by h1, drop the last two integrals in eq. (52), and drop all but
the rst term of series (53). for an integral with a more severe subdivergence, it
may be helpful to begin with a partial calculation by the nested method, thereby
reducing the degree of divergence with respect to one of the loop momenta before
applying the full matrix method.

a good example is the euclidean-space integral

i3 = z z

p(q, n, p) kk d2q d2k

[(q  k)2 + m2] [k2 + m2] f3(q)f4(q) . . .

,

(54)

in which p and f3, f4, . . . do not depend on k. because of the quadratic subdi-
vergence as |k|  , a direct application of the matrix method would lead to a

nite-parameter integral proportional to r a2da near a = 0 (after all parameters

except a had been integrated out). to avoid having to deal with such a severe sub-
divergence, we proceed in the spirit of eq. (11) by parametrizing the k-dependent
denominator factors only, to get

f3f4 . . .z 1
i3 = z pd2q

(55)

where

y [f (k)]  z d2k f (k) exp(cid:16)  a[k2  2vqk + vq2 + m2](cid:17).

(56)

since eq. (56) has the same form as eq. (30) (with z = k, m = a, b = avq, and
c = a(vq2 + m2)), application of eqs. (35) and (36) yields

with l  (v  v2)q2 + m2. we next use formula (13) and eq. (56) to obtain

a(cid:19)
y [1] = (cid:18)

(57)

where e  v2qq + l/(2  2).

from the left and right ends of eq. (57), we see that i3 is unchanged if we
replace the k-dependent argument kk in eq. (55) by the parameter-dependent
polynomial e(q, v), thereby reducing the degree of the subdivergence. we then
cancel f factors, wherever possible, with factors in the terms of pe, parametrize
the remaining f factors in accordance with formula (9), and nally complete the
integration by using either the matrix method or the nested method, whichever is
easier to apply.

4 renormalization

wherever a quark line appears in a physical process, any one of the diagrams of
figure 1, as well as higher-loop diagrams, could also appear. hence, the eective
quark propagator ise is the sum of the bare propagator is from subsection
2.1, plus contributions from self-energy processes with one loop, two loops, and so
on:

ise = is + is1is + is(cid:16)1is1 + 2(cid:17)is + . . . ,

= is + is(cid:16)1 + 2 + . . .(cid:17)ise ,

where 1 is the one-loop amputated green function dened by eq. (4), 2 is the
sum of the green functions for the two-loop diagrams of figures 1a to 1e, and so on.
(2 will also include amplitudes of one-loop processes with counterterm vertices, as
explained below.) since j is proportional to g2j, j = 1, 2, 3, . . ., the right-hand side
of (58) is a power series in g2. similar series may be constructed for the eective
gluon propagator and vertex factors:

replaced by renormalized propagators and vertex factors. for instance, if we let

in eq. (1), where n and m are both of order g2, then the quark propagator in
eq. (2) becomes

sren(p) = h(1 + 0n 0)(p/  m + m)(1 + n)i1

,

= s(p)  s(p)hm + 0n 0(p/  m) + (p/  m)nis(p) + o(g4),

(68)

(69)

where the i term has been suppressed for clarity. at the same time, we see from
eq. (58) that in order to make se nite, we need to replace s by

sren = s  ishdivergent part of 1is + o(g4) + . . ..

(70)

comparing eqs. (69) and (70), substituting for 1 from eq. (62), and noting that
n/ = n/ and 0n/ = n/0, we nd that we can eliminate the one-loop divergence
from the eective quark propagator by taking [11]

m = 3mescf + o(g4)

and

n = escf  n/n/

nn

1

2! + o(g4).



(71)

similarly, to eliminate two-loop divergences from se, we will need to compute 2,
and so on.

the substitutions m  mm and   +n produce the necessary counter-
terms in the lagrangian density (1). from eq. (71) we see that the counterterms
involving n are noncovariant, but we may hide this noncovariance by absorbing the
factor (1 + n) into the normalization of the quark eld . similar renormalizations
of the gluon elds aa
 lead to cancellation of the noncovariant divergences in the
eective gluon propagator and three- and four-gluon vertex corrections. bassetto,
dalbosco, and soldati (bds) have pointed out some time ago that noncovariant
divergences may be eliminated in this way from the eective light-cone propagators
and vertex factors, at all orders of perturbation theory [10, 11]. we shall verify this
claim explicitly for the case of the eective quark propagator at two-loop order.

4.1 one-loop counterterm subtractions

the use of renormalized propagators and vertex factors in place of s, g, ig,
etc. aects se through the  factors in eq. (58), as well as through s directly,

23

because the  factors involve amplitudes which depend on the propagators and
vertex factors through the feynman rules. in accordance with standard procedure,
these indirect contributions to se are represented by subtraction diagrams, such
as those depicted in figure 3. the diagrams of figure 3 are specically constructed
from those of figs. 1a to 1e by collapsing the divergent one-loop subgraphs (shown
in fig. 2) to the counterterm vertices denoted by  in figure 3.
in each case,
the counterterm vertex factor is minus the divergent part of the amplitude of the
corresponding subgraph. these amplitudes are given in eqs. (62) to (66). the terms
proportional to n or n in eqs. (64) and (65) may be dropped (see figs. 3c and 3d),
since they are orthogonal to the light-cone propagators of the gluons.

the one-loop amplitudes 1, (1), (2), (2), and (1) are of order g2, so that the
amplitudes of figures 3a to 3e are all of order g4. these amplitudes belong, therefore,
to 2, along with the amplitudes of figures 1a to 1e, of course. in principle, the
amplitudes of the one-particle-reducible diagrams (figure 4) also contribute to 2,

but it is easy to see that the divergent parts of these amplitudes cancel completely
with one another, due to the factorizability of all four integrals.

all of the diagrams of figures 3 and 1a to 1e contribute nonlocal divergences
to 2; however, the nonlocal contributions from figs. 1a to 1e are exactly cancelled
by the nonlocal parts from the corresponding diagrams of figure 3, as expected on
theoretical grounds [9, 23, 24].

4.2 two-loop counterterms

the divergent parts of the amplitudes for figures 1a to 1e and 3a to 3e are shown
in table 1, excluding the nonlocal divergent terms which cancel as noted above. to
nd the local divergent part of the amplitude for a particular gure, one multiplies
the numbers in the applicable row of the table by the corresponding factors at the
top of the table, then adds the resulting terms together, and multiplies the sum by
the color factor at the right-hand end of the row. (we recall that   2  , and

es  g2()(4) for modied minimal subtraction.) the divergent part of 2

is the sum of the results for all ten gures, as shown in the total section at the
bottom of the table.

a knowledge of the divergent part of 2 enables us to verify explicitly that
the eective quark propagator may indeed be rendered nite at two-loop order by
means of the substitutions m  mm and    + n , as implied by bassetto,

dalbosco and soldati. the o(es) parts of n and m are already shown in eqs. (71).

multiplying eq. (59) by s1 from the left and by (se)1 from the right, then solving
for (se)1 and replacing s by sren, we get

(se)1 = (sren)1  i1  i2  . . ..

(72)

to keep se nite at two-loop order, we must ensure that the divergent parts of
2 in eq. (72) are cancelled by terms from (sren)1; the latter depends on n and
m, as seen from eq. (68). (the divergent parts of 1 cancel already, thanks to the

particular choice of the o(es) parts of n and m.) inverting and expanding the

26

right-hand side of (68), we obtain

(74)

(75)

(76)

where n   0n 0. comparison of the terms of this expansion with the expres-
s) parts of n and

(sren)1 = s1 + m + (m  m)(cid:16)n  + n + n n(cid:17) + n p/n + n p/ + p/n,
sions at the tops of the columns in table 1 suggests that the o(e2
m should be similar in form to the o(es) parts shown in eqs. (71). therefore, let

us try the ansatz

se can be nite only if there is some value of x that makes expression (76) match
the noncovariant, divergent part of i2. such a match is possible, but only because
the coecients under np n/ in the total part of table 1 are the negatives of the
corresponding coecients under n p n/, except for the last two double-pole coe-
cients in the last row. these last double-pole coecients give rise to a term which
cancels with the last term in brackets in (76). this term in (76) derives purely from
the leading term of n, via the n p/n term in eq. (73), so its coecient cannot be
adjusted (unlike x) to make it cancel with some arbitrary term from i2. conse-
quently, the anti-symmetry between the coecients of np n/ and np n/ in 2 must
be broken in exactly the way that we have found it to be broken, otherwise the bds
scheme would have failed.

to complete our derivation of n and m, having substituted from eqs. (74) and
(75) into eq. (73), we then substitute from eq. (73) and table 1 into eq. (72), and
s) terms on the right to zero. in this way we nd the following

expressions for w , x, and y :

thus we have conrmed the claim of bassetto, dalbosco, and soldati for the two-loop
quark self-energy function. it is also signicant to realize that the mass counterterm
m in the light-cone gauge, eq. (74), is exactly the same as in the general linear
covariant gauge [22], at least up to two-loop order. this result is a reassuring
reection of the gauge symmetry of qcd [25].

5 conclusion

in this paper, we have evaluated the complete quark propagator to two-loop or-
der, and demonstrated for the rst time its renormalizability in the noncovariant
light-cone gauge. the chief technical tool in this three-year project was the pow-
erful matrix integration technique which had been exploited in our rst paper [4]
to evaluate the divergent part of the overlapping self-energy function (see fig. 1b
in the present article). now, three years later, we have nally succeeded in com-
puting, without approximation, the divergent parts of the four remaining two-loop
diagrams in the quark propagator, namely: the quark-bubble diagram (fig. 1e), the
rainbow diagram (fig. 1a), the spider diagram (fig. 1c), and the gluon-bubble dia-
gram (fig. 1d), along with their counterterm graphs, depicted in figs. 3e, 3a, 3c and
3d, respectively.

other technical tools, apart from the matrix method and a reliable computer
algebra program, included dimensional regularization, the n
-prescription for the
spurious poles of (q n)1 (n2 = 0), as well as a detailed analysis of the boundary
singularities in ve- and even six-dimensional parameter space.

the divergent part of the total two-loop correction 2 to the quark propagator

can be read o from table 1, and has the form

with es  g2()(4)2. the expression (80) has several noteworthy features:

28

(i) the anti-symmetry between the coecients of npn/ and npn/ (proportional to
f ) is identical to the anti-symmetry predicted by the bassetto-dalbosco-

sc 2
soldati renormalization scheme [10].

e2

(ii) the divergent part of 2 is a local function of the external momentum p, even
o mass-shell, since all nonlocal divergent terms cancel exactly. notice that
2 contains both covariant and noncovariant components.

(iii) the structure of 2 implies the quark mass counterterm m,

m = 3mes cf + me2

s cf w + o(e3

s) ,

which is gauge-independent, as expected (w is given by eq. (77)). it is both
interesting, and re-assuring from a calculational point of view, that the mass
counterterm in the noncovariant light-cone gauge is exactly the same as in the
general linear covariant gauge [22]  at least to two-loop order.

(81)

(iv) the factor n for the renormalization of the quark eld  is likewise local,

albeit gauge-dependent:

n = es cf  n/n/

(82)

with x and y dened in eqs. (78) and (79), respectively.

the cancellation of nonlocal divergences, the consistency of our results with the
bassetto-dalbosco-soldati renormalization scheme, and the agreement between our
mass renormalization and the two-loop covariant result all serve to demonstrate the
reliability of the matrix integration method, as well as the validity, at two-loop order,
of the n
-prescription for the unphysical poles of the light-cone gauge propagator.

since physically meaningful predictions can only be made with a theory whose
divergences have been subtracted consistently, our result will help to make the light-
cone gauge a more useful tool for practical two-loop calculations in qcd and other
non-abelian theories. complete two-loop renormalization will also allow the com-
putation of certain three-loop quantities, by means of renormalization group im-
provements [26].

of course, the cancellation of the divergences in the eective quark propagator
is only part of the overall renormalization picture. in order to complete the two-
loop renormalization of light-cone qcd, we must also nd the counterterms which
eliminate the two-loop divergences from the eective gluon propagator and vertex
factors. we should be able to nd these new counterterms using the same methods
that have worked in this paper for the renormalization of the quark propagator.

appendix

the tables in this appendix show one possible way in which the integrals ia to
ie from subsection 2.2 may be broken down into simpler integrals. specically, if
we regard the columns of the tables as cartesian vectors, then ia, for example, is
the sum over all ve tables of the dot product of the column headed by ia (if any),
times the integral over q and k of the integrand column (plus some nite integrals
which have been discarded). blank spaces in the tables denote zeros. for example,

ic = 4z n/np d2q d2k

nqqx o

+ 2z n/ d2q d2k

n xkk

+ . . ..

the symbols in the denominators of the integrands are to be decoded as follows:

n  nq,

o  nk,

q  q2,

k  k2,

q  [(p  q)2 + m2],

x  [(p  q  k)2 + m2],

k  [(p  k)2 + m2],

y  (q  k)2.

note that all 4-vectors in this appendix are in euclidean space.

for each row of each table, the divergent part of the integral over q and k of the
expression in the integrand column is 2(2)(m2 + p2)2 times the expression
in the nal column, where   2  , and
