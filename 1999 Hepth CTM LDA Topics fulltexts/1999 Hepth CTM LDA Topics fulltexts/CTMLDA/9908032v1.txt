abstract

application of the geometrically-inspired representations to the -expansion of
the two-point function with dierent masses is considered. explicit result for an
arbitrary term of the expansion is obtained in terms of log-sine integrals. con-
struction of the -expansion in the three-point case is also discussed.

1. when studying feynman diagrams, especially those with three or more external
particles, one of the most important issues is how to choose appropriate variables. in
particular, these variables should be chosen in such a way that the solutions of landau
equations [1], i.e. the positions of possible singularities, could be easily identied and
understood. studying the singularities of diagrams was the rst reason of introducing
geometrical ideas for the three-point [2] and four-point [3] functions at one loop. with a
one-loop n-point diagram one can associate an n-dimensional euclidean basic simplex
(for details, see e.g. in [4]) whose sides are directly related to the masses and the external
momenta invariants. then, the situations when the volume (content) of this simplex
vanishes correspond to the positions of possible singularities. for instance, for a two-
point function with an external momentum k12 this basic simplex is just a triangle whose
two sides are equal to m1 and m2 (the masses of the internal particles) and the third
12 = (m1  m2)2, i.e. at the threshold and

12. its area vanishes when k2

side is k12  qk2

pseudothreshold.

another important step was to understand that the evaluation of feynman integrals
themselves, not only looking for the positions of the singularities, could be also reduced
to a purely geometrical problem. in particular, as it is shown in [4] (see also in [5] for a
brief review), the feynman parametric representation of a one-loop n-point integral can
be directly transformed into an integral over one of the n-dimensional solid angles of this
basic simplex. the latter can be understood as the integral over an (n  1)-dimensional
simplex in non-euclidean space of constant curvature.
in particular, the four-point
function in four dimensions is proportional to the volume of a non-euclidean tetrahedron
in spherical or hyperbolic space. the three-point function in three dimensions is just
the area of a spherical (or hyperbolic) triangle; in this way, a very nice result of [6] was
reproduced in a purely geometrical way. the three-point function in four dimensions is
also an integral over the same triangle, but with an extra weight factor 1/ cos , where
 is the angle between the running vector of integration and the direction of the height
of the basic simplex (which is a tetrahedron in this case). one can even get rid of this
weight factor, reducing the three-point function to a special (asymptotic) case of the four-
point function [7]. for some other links between feynman diagrams and non-euclidean
geometry, see in [8].

instead of repeating all conclusions given in [4], we have decided to present here an
extended discussion of using the geometrically-inspired representations for the evaluation
of integrals in the framework of dimensional regularization [9], when the space-time
dimension is n = 4  2. sometimes it is possible to present results valid for an arbitrary
, usually in terms of hypergeometric functions. however, for practical purposes the
coecients of the expansion in  are important. in particular, in multiloop calculations
higher terms of the -expansion of the one-loop functions are needed, since one can get
contributions where these functions are multiplied by singular factors containing poles
in . in this paper, we derive an explicit result for an arbitrary term of the -expansion
of two-point function with arbitrary masses. we also discuss the construction of the
-expansion of the three-point function.

2. according to section iv of [4], for the two-point function with an external momen-
tum k12 and internal masses m1 and m2, with unit powers of propagators (1 = 2 = 1),
in n = 4  2 dimensions, we get

j (2)(4  2; 1, 1) = i 2 ()

here it is assumed that (m1  m2)2  k2

the integral (2) can be presented in terms of the hypergeometric function 2f1 given in
eq. (4.12) of [4] (see also in [10]). expanding (2) in , we get

f0( ) = tan ,

f1( ) =  tan  ln(cos  )  tan  + ,

integrating by parts, we see that the fj function (6) can be reduced to the generalized

fj( ) = (1)j tan  lnj(cos  ) + jlj( )  jfj1( ).

(12)

when we consider the innite sum over j, eq. (5), the logarithmic tail in eq. (12) can

be summed up into a closed form, since

(14)

it is obvious that l1( ) =  . then, note that l2( )  l( ) is what is usually called
the lobachevsky function (see e.g. in appendix a of [4]). it is related to the clausen
function cl2 via l2( ) =  1

2 cl2 (  2 ) +  ln 2.

by a simple transformation of the integration variable, the lj function (10) can be

presented as a nite sum of log-sine integrals (see in [11], chapter 7.9)

namely:

note that ls1() = , ls2() = cl2(), ls2() = 0. some other values of lsi() are
given in eq. (7.113) of [11] in terms of (j). the result for lsi() with an arbitrary i is
given in eq. (45) of appendix a.2.7 of [11] in terms of a dierential operator, which can
be represented in a more compact form as

lsj+1() = 

for j = 3, eq. (16) yields

(18)

note that the function ls3 has also occurred in the -part of a triangle diagram with
massless internal particles [12].

substituting (16) into eq. (14), the resulting three-fold sum can be simplied,

finally, taking into account eqs. (3)(4), we obtain for the integral (1)

(21)

the coecient at j has a closed form in terms of the lsj+1 functions, whose arguments
have a simple geometrical interpretation. note that, according to eq. (17), the innite
sum with lsj+1() in eqs. (20)(21) can be converted into

(2)j

j!



xj=0

lsj+1() = 

(1 + 2)

.

(22)

as it was mentioned before, the obtained result (21) can be directly applied in the
region (m1  m2)2  k2
12  (m1 + m2)2. in other regions, the analytic continuation of
(21) gives expressions in terms of (generalized) polylogarithms. the result for the -term
was obtained in [13]. for the case m1 = 0 (m2  m), the rst terms of the expansion
(up to 3) are presented in eq. (a.3) of [14].

an important special case of eq. (21) is m1 = m2  m, k2

in this case,
12 = 1
6 . therefore, the j-th term of the expansion contains
lsj+1(2/3). in particular, this is the reason why ls3(2/3) appears in the results for
some two-loop diagrams considered in [15].

3  and 01 = 02 = 1

12 = m2.

3. the geometrical approach to the three-point function is discussed in section v
of [4]. the integration extends over a spherical (or hyperbolic) triangle, as shown in

5

fig. 6 of [4], with a weight factor 1/ cos12  (see eqs. (3.38)(3.39) of [4]). this triangle
123 is split into three triangles 012, 023 and 031. then, each of them is split into two
rectangular triangles, according to fig. 9 of [4]. we consider the contribution of one of
the six resulting triangles, namely the left rectangular triangle in fig. 9. its angle at the
vertex 0 is denoted as 1
12, whereas the height dropped from the vertex 0 is denoted
12.

2+

as compared to the four-dimensional ( = 0) case described in section vb of [4],

eq. (5.14) should be transformed (for non-zero ) into



1
2




cos2 (, ),

where  is an auxiliary variable (0    1). integrating (23) over  yields

1

2 hcos2 (0, )  cos2 (1, )i =

1

2 
1  1 +


tan2 12

.

therefore, the remaining  integration is (cf. eq. (5.16) of [4])

(25)

in the limit   0 we get a combination of cl2 functions, eq. (5.17) of [4].

collecting the results for all six triangles, we get the result for the three-point function
with arbitrary masses and external momenta, corresponding (at  = 0) to the analytic
continuation of the well-known formula presented in [16]. the -term of the three-point
function has been calculated in [13] in terms of li3. the case of massless internal particles
has been considered in [17]. its analytic continuation in terms of ls3 functions has been
constructed in [12]. note that the same functions occur in the results for the two-loop
vacuum diagrams with dierent masses. this connection was observed in [18] and then
explained in [12]. we believe that the higher terms of the expansion (25) can also be
presented in a compact form in terms of the lsj functions.
