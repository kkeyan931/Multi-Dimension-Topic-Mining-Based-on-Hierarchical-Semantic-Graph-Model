abstract

the reduction of 4d matter-gravity theory to s2, h2 or r2 leads to ef-
fective 2d dilatonic gravity with dilaton coupled matter. spinors give the
exceptional example of the theory which is conformally invariant in 4d as
well as in 2d, after reduction. we nd 4d and 2d conformal anomaly induced
eective action (ea) for majorana spinor. it is expected for some time that
s-wave ea (i.e. the one for dilaton coupled 2d matter) is some (s-wave) ap-
proximation to 4d ea. we compare such 2d and 4d spinor eas on the same
gravitational background and argue that s-wave ea indeed qualitatively cor-
responds to no higher derivatives approximation for 4d ea.

it is well-known (see ref.[1]) that spherical reduction of gravity with mat-
ter leads to specic model of 2d dilaton gravity interacting with dilaton
coupled matter. for example, 4d minimal scalar after reduction is described
as 2d dilaton coupled scalar. the calculation of conformal anomaly as well as
anomaly induced ea (which represents part of complete ea) for 2d dilaton
coupled scalar has been done in refs.[2].

it is clear that such ea is given in the approximation where due to spher-
ical symmetry of the problem one neglects the modes corresponding to spher-
ical coordinates. that is why it is called ea in s-wave approximation. it is
the hope that this ea in s-wave approximation may qualitatively describe
4d physics (bhs, wormholes or quantum cosmology). the attempts to apply
it in the study of quantum properties of 4d bhs may be found in refs.[3, 4].
in some sense such investigation is similar to description of quantum 2d bhs
in cghs and rst models of dilatonic gravity (for a very incomplete list of
refs. see [16, 15, 5]) but now 2d bh with dilaton is interpreted as 4d bh.
interchange of radial coordinate with time in above problem gives the way
to apply ea in s-wave approximation in the study of quantum properties
of 4d kantowski-sacks cosmologies [6] as it was shown in refs.[7]. there is
clear analogy here with 2d quantum cosmology as it follows from cghs or
rst-like models [8]. however, despite all these applications the precise cor-
respondence between complete 4d ea (which is very dicult to nd) and ea
in s-wave approximation (this ea is much easier to obtain) is still lacking.

the purpose of this letter will be to compare these two eas and to
clarify the reliability of s-wave approximation. note that for conformally
invariant matter one can easily get 4d anomaly induced ea on the arbitrary
gravitational background. it is given with the accuracy up to conformally
invariant functional which is numerical constant for some backgrounds. on
the same time the one-loop ea in s-wave approximation is known [2] for
minimal (non-conformal) scalar. hence, scalar is not good example to make
comparison of induced (complete) 2d and 4d eas. (however, one can com-
pare stress tensors from 4d minimal scalar and from corresponding ea in
s-wave approximation).

we consider (majorana) spinor. in this case 4d anomaly induced ea for
conformal spinor is well-known. on the same time the 2d anomaly induced
ea for dilaton coupled spinor which corresponds to s-wave reduction of con-
formal spinor has been found in ref.[14]. moreover, it actually gives complete
ea (no conformally invariant functional appears) as it was shown in ref.[14].

2

we compare these eas for the same 4d gravitational backgrounds and we
show that in general they do not match even in the number of derivatives
(higher derivatives 4d ea versus s-wave ea which is of second order on
derivatives). nevertheless,we argue that s-wave ea may still be in qualita-
tive agreement with complete 4d ea calculated in the approximation where
higher derivatives terms may be neglected. brief remarks on calculation of
hawking radiation from above actions are also given.

we will start from the lagrangian of 4d dimensional (majorana) spinors:

l =

xi=1

it is well-known that such theory is conformally invariant. on the quantum
level, the conformal invariance is broken, what leads to conformal anomaly

where square of the weyl tensor is given by f = rr  2r r +

3 r2 and gauss-bonnet invariant is g = rr  4r r + r2. for
majorana spinors b = 3n
having the explicit expression for conformal anomaly one can turn now
to the calculation of the anomaly induced ea. starting from the background
with the metric

120(4)2 , b =  11n

720(4)2 .

g = e2 g

(3)

where g is a xed ducial metric (reference) one can suppose that all dy-
namics is included to the conformal factor  dependence. then, using the
denition of stress-energy trace via some (gravitational) action with explicit
help of eq.(3), one gets

t =

g

w


.

(4)

substituting the metric (3) to eq.(2) and integrating over  one nds the
anomaly induced ea [10].

this ea may be represented in the non-covariant local form [10]

w = z d4xgnb f  + 2bh 2 + 2 r

where -independent terms (generalized integration constant) are not written
explicitly. hence, w is not complete, the only -dependence is exactly taken
into account. note that one has to extract r2 term from the last term in (5)
if to use the usual condition that w vanishes at  = 0.

it may be also presented in covariant but non-local form [10]:

the total one-loop eective action is given as follows

(6)

(7)

where the second term (conformally invariant functional) cannot be found
from the only conformal anomaly. of course, second term (generalized in-
tegration constant) of  is covariant one.
it is only to show explicitly its
conformal invariance we write the argument as tilded metric.

let us give few explicit examples.

1. first of all, we consider conformally at space, i.e., g = . in this
exceptional case, the second term in eq.(7) is the numerical constant which
may be dropped away. hence, in such case

 = w = z d4xn2b 2  2(b + b)(cid:16)  + ( )( )(cid:17)2o .

(8)

to even simplify the problem, we suppose that  depends only on conformal
time . then

w = v3z d(cid:26)2b  2(b + b)(cid:16) + 2(cid:17)2(cid:27) .

here v3 is the (innite) volume of 3-dimensional at space,   d
d and  =
ln  where () is the scale factor. it is known that semiclassical einstein
gravity (with quantum corrections described by the action (9)) leads to the
possibility of ination [11] even in the presence of dilaton [12].

2. let us consider the situation discussed in ref.[13] when g = (cid:16)g(2)

 is an arbitrary two-dimensional metric and g

where g(2)
 is two-dimensional
metric for the space with constant or zero curvature (s2, h2 or r2). then
supposing that  depends on coordinates from g(2)

 only one gets

(10)

w takes the simplest form when g
 = , i.e. r = 0. however, even in
this case there is an additional, conformally invariant functional  which is
unknown and which should be added to w to form the complete one-loop
eective action (7). this unknown functional may be found as an expansion
(see [13]) but in this case conformal invariance may be lost. hence, we
presented anomaly induced ea in its explicit form for two metrics which
come naturally from cosmological and black hole considerations.

at the next point, we consider the same majorana spinor lagrangian (1).

assume the 4d compactied spacetime

ds2 = gdxdx + r2

0e2d2d

(11)

where d2d corresponds to 2d unit sphere s2: d2d = d2 + sin2 d2 or 2d
at space r2: d2d = dydz or unit hyperboloid h2: d2d = d2 + sinh2 d2

r2

and  depends on coordinates corresponding to g. then we nd qg(4) =
0e2 sin qg(2) for s2, qg(4) = r2
0e2qg(2) for r2 and qg(4) =
0e2 sinh qg(2) for h2. the integration of  (0   < 2) and  (0 
r2
   for sphere and 0   <  for hyperboloid) or (y, z) for r2 give 4 for
s2 and an innite constant for r2 or h2.

5

in the metric ansatz (11), not all the spin connections vanish. the non-
vanishing spin connections do not appear in the action of the majorana
fermion . therefore we nd in the metric (11) mdm = . here
m = 0, 1, 2, 3 ( = 0, 1) and dm is the covariant derivative in 4d. we should
note, however, that n majorana fermions in 4d corresponds to 2n majorana
fermions in 2d.

here (2) is the usual spinor (with mass dimension 1/2) in 2d. and we
abbreviate the sux (2) in the following if there is no confusion. the
action (13) describes 2d dilaton coupled spinor which is still conformally
invariant one. the corresponding 2d dilaton dependent conformal anomaly
has been calculated in ref.[14] as follows

t = c(cid:20)1

2

r + 2(cid:21) .

(14)

where c = n
12 . notice that this is an anomaly of two-dimensional quantum
spinor. the anomaly induced ea in this case has been also found in ref.[14]
in non-local, covariant form. it is more convienient for our purposes to use
local, non-covariant form of anomaly induced ea.

we suppose that two-dimensional metric in eq.(13) is chosen in the same

way as 4d metric in (3), i.e. g = e2 g. then r = e2(cid:16) r  (cid:17),
 = e2 . then eq.(4) looks as

w


= c(cid:26)1

2 (cid:16) r  2 (cid:17) + 2 (cid:27) .

(15)

6

integrating over , one nds the anomaly induced ea in generalized s-wave
approximation (we call it generalized s-wave one because 4d metric is com-
pactied to s2 ,or to h2, or to r2)

w = cz d2xg(cid:26) 1

r

the corresponding covariant, non-local expression looks as [14]

w =

(16)

(17)

the remarkable property of dilaton coupled spinor is that w gives the com-
plete one-loop ea[14] (up to non-essential constant) on the arbitrary dilaton-
gravitational background. no conformally invariant functional is necessary
for 2d dilaton coupled spinor unlike 4d case.

notice also[14] that the eective action (17) for 2d dilaton coupled spinor
gives natural realization of rst model [15] which represents the extension
of cghs model [16] on quantum level.

some remarks are in order. we got the eective action (16), (17) in gen-
eralized s-wave approximation. it means that we rst did reduction (11) of
classical matter action (13). then we neglected the dependence of quantum
ea from two coordinates (d). the memory on 4d space came through
dilatonic factor which appeared in eq.(13). the lagrangian (13) describes
now 2d quantum theory. s-wave ea comes from this 2d quantum theory. as
reduction and quantization do not commute, generally speaking, it is clearly
that such s-wave ea is not the same as 4d ea. nevertheless, it is usual
hope that such s-wave eective action still qualitatively well (in some sense)
describes 4d physics. moreover, it should have some relation with true eec-
tive action (for an introduction, see [17]) which is not available usually. for
example, the standard guess is that s-wave ea gives some approximation for
complete 4d ea.

our purpose now will be to calculate ea (16), (17), in s-wave approxi-
mation on the same two backgrounds where 4d anomaly induced ea(5), (6)
is calculated and to compare them.

first of all, we consider conformally at space, i.e., 2d metric g = ,
 = () and in eq.(11) d corresponds to 2d at space while  = .

7

anomaly induced action (16) at such conditions is

w = cv1z d(cid:26)

5
2

(cid:27) .

(18)

as one can see there is no even qualitative correspondence with 4d anomaly
induced ea (9) where we have only the derivatives of fourth order while
in (18) of second order. however, it is not the full story. that is due to
our background choice one gets no second order derivatives in 4d anomaly
induced ea.

it is not dicult to nd anomaly induced 2d ea for the second example

background discussed in 4d case above. then

w = cz d2xg(cid:26) 1

2

r(2) 

5
2

(cid:27) .

(19)

this again gives complete one-loop ea. again, this anomaly induced ea
and 4d ea (10) do not agree even in the number of derivatives. the explicit
correspondence is dicult to check as in 4d case one has unknown confor-
mally invariant functional completing ea. however, imagine that we are in a
situation where one can argue that higher derivatives terms in 4d ea may be
omitted (for example, adiabatic expansion, i.e. slowly varying elds). then
in such approximation one can see that only terms with two derivatives sur-
vive in eq.(10). moreover, the structure of these terms remarkably repeats
the structure of above 2d ea. both these eas are proportional to number
of spinors. it is clearly seen from eq.(10) (we take r = 2)

w  vz d2xgn 16b

9 (cid:16)r(2) + 1(cid:17)  + b(cid:18)
(b + b)(cid:16)r(2)  6  6(cid:17)o

 + 4r(2)(cid:19)

(20)

where higher derivative and constant terms are dropped. trivial dimensional
transformation should be done in order to present it in 2d form. as we see
signs and coecients do not match, of course. one can expect that after the
calculation of the conformally invariant functional in complete 4d ea the
approximation may become better.

let us briey comment on hawking radiation.asit follows from above
actions. we now work in the conformal gauge, where the metric has the
following form:

ds2 = e2(cid:16)dt2 + ds2(cid:17) + r2

0e2d2 .

(21)

8

the schwarzschild metric

ds2 = (cid:18)1 

r0

r (cid:19) dt2 +(cid:18)1 

r0

r (cid:19)1

dr2 + r2d2 .

(22)

can be transformed into the metric in the conformal gauge (21) by changing
the coordinate

(23)

(24)

s = r + r0 ln(cid:18) r

r0  1(cid:19) .

then the metric in (22) has the following form:

e2 =  1 

r0

r(s)! ,

e2 = r(s)2 .

substituting (24) into the quantum part of the stress-energy tensor t  given
by the eective action (17) induced from 2d anomaly, we obtain

t+ =

(25)

here x = t  s and m. the functions f (x) appear due to the non-
locality in (17) and should be xed by the boundary condition. here we
assume t+ = 0 at the past null innity (x  ) and t = 0 at the
past horizon (x+  ). then we nd

f +(x+) = 0 ,

f (x) =

(26)

now one can estimate hawking radiation (which is proportional to particles
number) at the future null innity x+  +):

t

.

(27)

this result looks simple enough in 2d language.

the eective action (6) induced from 4d anomaly is also non-local and
there is a possibility to generate the hawking radiation. in the schwarzschild
metric, the curvatures have the following form:

r = r = 0 , rr =

12r2
0
r6

,

(28)

9

then we nd an expression of the trace anomaly (2):

t =

12 (b + b) r2
0

r6

.

(29)

the arguments on calculation of hawking radiation using 4d conformal
anomaly in the schwarzschild metric and the conservation law t 
; = 0
have already been given in [18]. the results should be equivalent to that
based on the complete non-local eective action (6). it was shown in [18]
that there remain two integration constants and an unknown function which
is relevant to the hawking radiation but cannot be xed from the conserva-
tion law and the trace anomaly. they could be xed dening the vacuum
state and/or the hawking radiation itself.

hence our main conclusion is that s-wave ea may be still relevant to 4d
physics. however, it should be possible only for gravitational backgrounds
where no higher derivatives terms approximation to ea is valid.
