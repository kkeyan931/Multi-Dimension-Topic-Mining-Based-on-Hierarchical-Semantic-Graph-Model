abstract

to test recent ideas about lower dimensional gravity bound to a brane, we construct

exact solutions describing black holes on two-branes in four dimensions. we nd that

2 + 1 gravity is indeed recovered at large distances along the brane, although there are

signicant deviations at smaller scales. large black holes appear as attened pancakes,

with a relatively small extent o the brane. black hole thermodynamics is discussed from

both the standpoint of the brane and the bulk. we comment on the analogous black holes

bound to higher dimensional branes.

november, 1999

1. introduction

randall and sundrum have recently argued that four-dimensional gravity can natu-

rally arise at long distances on a three-brane embedded in ve dimensions [1]. they started

by taking two copies of (a part of) ve-dimensional anti-de sitter space (ads5) and gluing
them together along a boundary which could be interpreted as the three-brane. they

then studied linearized uctuations about this background. there is a zero mode which

looks like a four-dimensional graviton bound to the brane, together with a continuum of

massive kaluza-klein modes. they argued that the zero mode produces the standard 1/r

gravitational potential along the brane, and the kaluza-klein modes give rise to negligible
corrections of order 2/r3 where  is the radius of curvature of ads5.

this intriguing alternative to compactication has attracted considerable interest.

(for earlier work on related ideas, see [2] and references therein.) however, there is a
potential problem1. the background solution contains ads5 horizons which are innitely
far from the brane in spacelike directions, but can be reached by observers in nite proper

time (just like the horizons of extreme charged black holes). the linearized modes studied

in [1] turn out to be singular on these horizons [5]. since there is no reason for physics on

the brane to produce curvature singularities elsewhere in spacetime, there is some concern

that the right boundary conditions have not been imposed. alternatively, the singularities

may just be an artifact of the expansion in plane waves. it is possible that when localized

sources and wave packets are considered, the singularities will be removed.

to test this, we consider the analogous question in one lower dimension. in this case

we are not limited to a linearized analysis about an ads4 background. instead, one can
construct exact four-dimensional solutions describing localized black holes bound to a two-

brane. to obtain them, notice that a black hole on a brane in ads is accelerating. there

is a solution to einsteins equation that describes accelerating black holes, called the c-

metric [6]. this solution can be extended to include a cosmological constant [7]. of course,

one needs a mechanism to accelerate these black holes, so these solutions usually contain

conical singularities along the axis from the black hole to innity. these singularities can

be interpreted as cosmic strings pulling on the black holes. to obtain our solutions, we nd

an appropriate three-surface  such that there are no conical singularities on one side of .

1 we will be interested in the case where the fth direction is innite. if one makes it nite by
introducing a second brane with negative tension [3], this potential problem cannot arise. however

these models have other problems of their own [4], as we will comment on later.

1

we then glue two copies of this part of the spacetime together along , and verify that the

induced stress tensor on  is proportional to the induced metric. this ensures that  can

be interpreted as a two-brane. the net result is a solution without conical singularities,

with a smooth ads horizon, and containing a black hole bound to the planck two-brane.

the key question now is whether lower dimensional gravity is recovered on the brane.

three-dimensional gravity is rather special since spacetime is locally at outside the matter,

and the total mass is reected in an asymptotic decit angle [8]. nevertheless, we do recover

2 + 1 gravity at large distances along the brane. since the mass aects the leading order

2 + 1 metric rather than a subleading correction (as in higher dimensions), it is perhaps

even more remarkable that this is recovered from a four-dimensional solution. we believe

this is strong support for the randall-sundrum scenario.

deviations from 2 +1 gravity arise at order 1/r, reecting the four-dimensional nature

of the black hole. for large black holes, these deviations can be signicant at large scales.

large black holes look like attened pancakes, since they are much larger in the directions

along the brane than in directions o the brane. there is a maximum mass in 2 + 1 gravity

corresponding to the fact that the decit angle cannot be greater than 2 [9]. we will see

that the area of the black hole grows without bound as the mass approaches this limit.

thus arbitrarily large black holes can be produced from nite mass! this unusual property

appears to be a special feature of black holes on two-branes, and we do not think it will

continue in the more realistic case of three-branes. however, one prediction that we can

make about the higher dimensional solution is that corrections to the 1/r potential on a
three-brane should start at order 1/r2, not 1/r3 as suggested in [1]. this is just because

the black hole is essentially ve-dimensional.

we also study the thermodynamics of the black holes we construct. since the black

hole temperature is constant over the horizon, it is the same in the bulk and on the brane.

the entropy is one-quarter of the area of the full four-dimensional black hole. since

the four-dimensional solution is not asymptotically ads in the usual sense, one cannot

dene a four-dimensional total mass in the usual way. nevertheless, one can integrate the

thermodynamic relation dm = t ds to obtain an eective mass for the black hole. this

turns out to agree exactly with the 2 + 1 mass obtained from the asymptotic geometry

along the brane. even though the mass and temperature both agree when computed in the

bulk and on the brane, the entropy is not one-quarter of the circumference of the horizon

on the brane. this is hardly surprising since there are no pure 2 + 1 black holes (in the

2

absence of a cosmological constant). however, we nd that in the limit of large black

holes, the entropy reduces to one-quarter of the circumference, up to small corrections.

this result holds in the higher dimensional case as well, due to the ads geometry.

the outline of this paper is the following. in the next section, we extend the randall-

sundrum construction to general dimensions, and review the potential problem with sin-

gularities. in section 3, we construct the solutions describing black holes on a two-brane,

show that 2 + 1 gravity is recovered and investigate the thermodynamic properties of the

black hole. the last section contains a discussion of the implications of these results for

the more realistic higher dimensional solution.

2. randall-sundrum scenario in n + 1 dimensions

while the original analysis of randall and sundrum [1] was made in ve dimensions,

it is easily extended to an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions. furthermore, their

treatment of the linearized graviton bound to the brane can be extended to include the full

nonlinear equations. to see this, we start with the following metric in n + 1 dimensions

ds2 = gabdxadxb =

2

z2 (cid:2)g(x)dxdx + dz2(cid:3) .

(2.1)

if the n-dimensional metric g corresponds to at space, i.e., g =  , the full metric
(2.1) describes adsn+1 in poincare coordinates. conformal innity is reached at z = 0,
while z =  corresponds to the usual ads horizon. one may note [10][11], however, that
eq. (2.1) continues to satisfy einsteins equations with a negative cosmological constant,
i.e., rab(g) = (n/2) gab, provided g is ricci-at, i.e., if g satises the vacuum
einstein equations in n dimensions: r (g) = 0. the curvature in the modied metric
now satises

2n(n + 1)

4

+

z4
4 rrrr .

rabcdrabcd =

(2.2)

two points are noteworthy here: first, a curvature singularity generically appears on the
horizon at z =  [10][11]. second, the asymptotic curvature falls o much more slowly
as z  0 than is usually considered for perturbations of adsn+1  see e.g., [12]. as a
result, these metrics are not asymptotically ads in the usual sense. if one started with a

metric g , it would require innite energy to change it.

the randall-sundrum geometry [1] is constructed by cutting o the asymptotic (small

z) region of eq. (2.1) at the surface z = , and completing the space by gluing onto this

3

surface a mirror copy of the large z geometry. translating z = z   so the brane resides
at z = 0, we may write the resulting metric as

ds2 =

2

( + |z|)2 (cid:2)g(x)dxdx + dz2(cid:3) .

(2.3)

this metric is continuous but not dierentiable. using the standard israel junction condi-

tions [13] (see also [14]), the discontinuity in the extrinsic curvature is interpreted in terms

of a -function source of stress-energy at z = . in the present case, the extrinsic curvature

of the z =  surface reduces to

k =

1
2

n g =

1


g

(2.4)

where n = z is the outward directed unit normal vector. then dening the discon-
tinuity in the extrinsic curvature across the gluing surface,   k +
, the
surface stress-tensor becomes

  k 

 = 2k +

s =

1

8gn+1

(  g

) = 

n  1
4gn+1

g .

(2.5)

the source of stress-tensor can then be interpreted as a thin relativistic (n1)-brane with
tension tn1 = (n  1)/(4gn+1), where gn+1 is the newtons constant in n + 1 dimen-
sions.

the interesting feature of the randall-sundrum geometry is that perturbations of the

n-dimensional metric g are now normalizable modes peaked at z =  or z = 0. in the
analysis of [1], those perturbations satisfying r (g) = 0 correspond to the zero-mode
which yields n-dimensional gravity on the brane. as in [1] by considering metrics of the

form (2.3), one can derive an eective action for the perturbations of g(x). one starts
with the (n + 1)-dimensional gravity action

i =

1

16gn+1 z dnx dzpg(cid:18)r +

n(n  1)

2

(cid:19) z dnxgbranetn1

(2.6)

which includes the contributions of a negative cosmological constant  = n(n  1)/22
in the bulk and the planck brane with tension tn. the induced metric on the brane is
precisely g . now using r = (z2/2) r(g) + . . . for eq. (2.1), one integrates over z to
obtain the eective n-dimensional action

i  =

(2.7)

where the brane tension (2.5) has been tuned to cancel cosmological constant contributions
in this action.2 hence the eective action governing the metric zero-mode is precisely the

n-dimensional einstein action where the eective newtons constant in n dimensions is

given by

gn =

n  2
2

gn+1 .

(2.8)

if one chooses g =  , the remaining metric perturbations, i.e., the kaluza-klein
modes, of the randall-sundrum geometry fall into a continuum of massive representations

of the n-dimensional lorentz group [1]. after gauge xing appropriately, one nds in
g gab = m2 gab. then the radial prole for these modes
separation of variables that 2
satises a schrodinger-like equation

(cid:0)2

z + v (z)(cid:1) (z) = m2(z)

with a so-called volcano potential

v (z) =

n2  1
4(|z| + )2 

n  1



(z) .

(2.9)

(2.10)

here, the metric perturbations satisfy g  (|z| + )(n5)/2(z), and one can easily
conrm that   (|z| + )(n1)/2 provides the desired zero-mode bound-state.

from (2.9) and (2.10), we see that the kaluza-klein modes with 0 < m2 < (n21)/42
are suppressed at the brane by the wings of the volcano potential. one can also interpret

this as the usual asymptotic suppression by the geometric potential barrier arising in

adsn+1. this suppression is sucient to ensure that at least on distance scales greater
than , gravity on the brane is actually n-dimensional einstein gravity up to small power-

law-suppressed corrections [1].

as illustrated in eq. (2.2), there is still a potential problem with the zero mode in

the randall-sundrum geometry. that is, generically one nds a curvature singularity as
z  . intuitively, however, one expects that masses conned to the brane will generate
localized gravitational elds, and so these singularities should not be physically relevant.

2 if one does not tune the cancellation of the cosmological constant and the brane tension in
the eective action (2.7), one generates an eective cosmological constant for the brane gravity

[15]. the resulting geometries can be regarded as extending the above construction to other

interesting slicings of adsn+1 [10]. we will construct black holes bound to such cosmological

branes elsewhere [16].

5

thus despite the suppressed coupling of the kaluza-klein modes, their contributions must

be signicant far from the brane and ensure that the total gravitational eld decays to zero
more rapidly than the zero-mode prole 2/z2. one approach to investigate this potential

problem is to construct explicit solutions of the (n + 1)-dimensional einstein equations

when a massive source is added on the planck brane. in the next section, we will construct

such a solution for the case of n = 3.

the case of n = 3 is special in that for three-dimensional gravity r = 0 in fact
implies that rr = 0. the eect of a massive source on the three-dimensional geometry
is to generate a decit angle and hence outside of the sources where the curvature vanishes,

the geometry is conical [8]. there are no black hole solutions for three-dimensional einstein

gravity (with vanishing cosmological constant). rather, point masses generate conical

singularities. considering just the zero mode in this context would correspond to setting

g in (2.1) to be the metric of a cone. the resulting solution has conical singularities
extending throughout the spacetime, not just on the brane. our results in the next section

show that such solutions are not physically relevant. rather, gravitational collapse of

sources on the brane will produce four-dimensional black holes, whose singularities lie

on the brane, and are surrounded by horizons that extend only slightly o the brane.

nevertheless, a decit angle is still present at large distances along the brane.

note that, in the above discussion, the brane was placed at z =  rather than some

general z = . however this is just a coordinate choice, and can be changed by rescaling

z in (2.1). it may seem a little surprising that there is no physics in the location of the
planck brane, since as z   one approaches the horizon, and one might have expected
the acceleration required to stay at constant z to increase. however, one can easily verify

that e.g., if g =  in eq. (2.1), the magnitude of the acceleration of the worldlines at
constant z (and xi) is always 1/, and does not diverge as z  . similarly, one can easily
conrm that k = (1/) g where g is the induced metric on the brane independent
of the choice for the location of the brane.

3. black holes on a two-brane

3.1. constructing the solution

in this section we will construct a solution describing a black hole on the planck brane

in the 3+1 analog of the randall-sundrum scenario. we begin with the following solution

6

of einsteins equation with a negative cosmological constant:

ds2 =

2

(x  y)2 (cid:20)(y2 + 2y3)dt2 +

dy2

(y2 + 2y3)

+

dx2
g(x)

+ g(x)d2(cid:21)

where

g(x) = 1  x2  2x3

(3.1)

(3.2)

one can verify that this metric satises rab = (3/2)gab. the metric (3.1) is a special
case of a more general solution called the ads c-metric [7]. it is clearly invariant under

translations of t and .

since the metric is written in terms of an unusual coordinate system, its physical

interpretation is not immediately clear. roughly speaking, y is like a radial variable,

and x is analogous to cos . to begin to understand this solution, let us consider the
range of these coordinates. if 0 <  < 1/33, then the cubic g(x) has three real roots
x0 < x1 < 0 < x2. we will discuss this case rst. since we need g(x)  0 in order
for the metric to have lorentz signature, we restrict x to lie in the range x1 < x < x2.
the factor (x  y)2 in front of the metric implies that y = x is innitely far away from
points with y 6= x. so we restrict y to satisfy  < y < x. it turns out that there is a
curvature singularity at y = . this singularity is not visible to all observers since there
is a black hole horizon at y = y0 = 1/2. there is a second horizon at y = 0 which is
degenerate, i.e., has zero hawking temperature (see fig. 1), which we will see corresponds

to the ads horizon. since g(x) vanishes at x = x1, x2 these directions correspond to the
axis of rotation (like  = 0, ). to avoid a conical singularity at x = x2, we must choose
 to have period

 =

4

|g(x2)|

(3.3)

however, once we have done this, we are no longer free to adjust the period of  at x = x1.
in general, there is a conical singularity along this axis corresponding to a decit angle

 =

4
g(x1)  

(3.4)

one can think of this as a cosmic string extending from the black hole out to asymptotic
innity. the surfaces of constant y are topological spheres for y < x1. but if y  x1 is
held constant, then x has only one axis at x = x2 (since it must remain greater than y).
the constant y surfaces become topologically r2.

7

if  > 1/33, the two roots x0 and x1 become complex. in this case, g(x) > 0 for all
x < x2, hence the allowed range of x becomes y  x  x2. in this case, one can still reach
x = y at y = y0 = 1/2 and so the event horizon reaches out to asymptotic innity. one
can think that the cosmic string above is replaced by a semi-innite black string extending

out to asymptotic innity. in this regime for all y, x has only one axis and the constant y
surfaces are topologically r2.

fig. 1: causal structure of (3.1) on sections of constant x. for x 6= 0 the sections are
asymptotically ads3. the section at x = 0 is like the radial geometry of a four-dimensional
schwarzschild black hole. the black hole horizons are at y = y0 = 1/2. the horizon
y = 0 is analogous to the ads horizon at z = . points in these diagrams are circles
parametrized by , which become of zero size at x = x2, and possibly at x = x1 < 0.

to get oriented, let us set  = 0. then 1  x  1,  = 2, and the black hole
horizon disappears (together with its curvature singularity inside). one can check that the

weyl tensor vanishes, so (3.1) must be ads4 in disguise. to obtain a more familiar form

then (3.1) with m = 0 becomes (compare to eq. (2.1))

ds2 =

2
z2 (dt2 + dr2 + r2d2 + dz2)

(3.6)

notice that y =  becomes the nonsingular worldline z = , r = 0. the region x = y
corresponds to the standard boundary at innity z = 0, and y = 0 corresponds to the
usual ads horizon in poincare coordinates z = . the coordinate transformation (3.5)
only holds for y < 0, but the metric (3.1) with  = 0 holds for all y < x with 1  x  1
(with only the usual coordinate singularity associated with the ads horizon). this covers

two poincare patches, one on each side of the horizon y = 0. for y > 0, the poincare

coordinates can be obtained by simply changing the overall signs in the denition of z
and r in (3.5). we only scaled the time coordinate in eq. (3.5),3 so the time translation

symmetry in (3.1) reduces to that for the poincare time when  = 0.

now consider the solution with  > 0. this introduces a black hole with horizon at
y = y0 = 1/2. for small , the causal structure outside the black hole is shown in fig. 2.
to obtain a solution describing a black hole on a two-brane, we repeat the construction of

section 2. hence rst, we must nd a timelike three-surface  whose extrinsic curvature is

proportional to its intrinsic metric. on one side of , there should be no conical singularity.

one can then take two copies of this side of the spacetime, and glue them together along

. the resulting spacetime will be free of conical singularities.

it turns out to be remarkably easy to nd a suitable : we can take  to be the surface
x = 0. there are no conical singularities in the region x  0. the extrinsic curvature k
of  can be calculated as in (2.4). the unit outward normal to the surfaces of constant x
is ( xy

 )pg(x)x. then

k = 

(x  y)pg(x)

2

g
x

(3.7)

where the derivative is evaluated at x = 0. since g(0) = 0, the only contribution to
the derivative comes from the overall factor of (x  y)2 in front of the metric. using
3 note that all of the coordinates in the metric (3.1) are dimensionless, while the coordinates

t, r and z have the expected dimension of length.

fig. 2: (pseudo-)penrose diagram showing the structure of the metric (3.1) in the

region outside a small black hole (small ). the black hole trajectory is indicated as the
region enclosed between two solid lines that correspond to y = y0 = 1/2. the two-brane
at x = 0 (z = ) cuts across the black hole horizon, and is indicated by a dashed line. in

the randall-sundrum model the region to the left of this surface (x2 < x < 0) is glued
along x = 0 onto a copy of itself.

g(0) = 1, one nds k = (1/)g where g be the induced metric at x = 0. thus our
nal spacetime is obtained by taking two copies of the region 0  x  x2 in the metric (3.1)
and gluing them along x = 0. the extrinsic curvature is precisely as in eq. (2.4), and so the

surface x = 0 is interpreted as a thin relativistic two-brane with tension t2 = 1/(2g4).

having constructed the desired exact solution, we can now check the main claim of [1]

that lower dimensional gravity is recovered at large distances on the brane. let us again

introduce the poincare coordinates (3.5). the two-brane at x = 0 is at z = . the black
hole horizon corresponds to z = [1  (x/y0)] = (1 + 2x). so the black hole is centered
on the brane z =  but extends o of it to zmax = (1 + 2x2) < (1 + 2) since x2 cannot
be greater than one. in contrast, the curvature singularity at y =  is located only on
the brane z =  at r = 0. the metric on the brane is

ds2 = (cid:18)1

dr2 + r2d2

(3.8)

10

as noted above, gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions (without a cosmological constant) is rather

trivial since the eld equations require spacetime to be locally at outside the matter.

the eect of the matter is to curve space into a cone. the metric on the brane (3.8) is

clearly not a solution of the three-dimensional einstein equations everywhere. however,
for r  , the geometry is approximately locally at, and the periodicity of  is not 2.
since  is not aected by the change to poincare coordinates, its periodicity is still given by

(3.3) to ensure that the axis x = x2 is smooth. thus, the geometry on the brane is indeed
asymptotically a cone with decit angle (3.4), as expected for three-dimensional gravity.
however, there are signicant deviations from r (g) = 0 for r = o(). note that for
large , these deviations extend out to very large distances. this is an artifact of 2+1

dimensions, where there are no deviations from atness to compete with the deviations

arising from the higher dimensions. note that the t-r part of this metric (3.8) coincides

precisely with that of the schwarzschild geometry.

as one moves away from the brane, the eects of the black hole diminish. if we stay on
the axis, x = x2, it is clear from (3.5) that large z corresponds to small y via y  x2/z.
the ratio of the  term in the metric to the leading term is 2y = 2x2/z. so the eects
of the black hole fall o like 1/z for large z, as expected for a four-dimensional black hole.
of course, the full metric g still contains an additional overall factor of (/z)2, as well.
it is not just the two-brane with the black hole at z =  that has a decit angle

asymptotically. we now show that any test brane at constant z will also have the same
decit angle.4 so 2 + 1 gravity holds asymptotically at all values of z! to see this, note
from (3.5) that on a surface of constant z =  + z, x = yz. from the denition of r,
r2y2 = 2(1  x2) = 2  y2z2 which implies

(3.9)



y = 

[r2 + z2]1/2

from these equations, it is clear that at large r for xed z, both y and x approach zero.

hence, from the metric (3.1), the  dependent terms become negligible, so the metric

approaches (3.6). however, the periodicity of  is unchanged and so there will be the

same decit angle on each of these test branes.

3.2. limiting cases

we now consider in more detail the limiting cases 0 <   1, and   1. first we
4 note that choosing to consider a test brane on surfaces of xed z is an arbitrary choice, at

least for small r.

which is exactly what we would expect for a schwarzschild black hole of mass /g4. from
(3.4), the conical singularity at x = x1 corresponds to a string with tension /8g4 =
/g4. so before we introduce the brane, the full metric (3.1) describes a black hole of
mass /g4 and acceleration 1/ provided by a string.

in 2 + 1 gravity, the asymptotic decit angle is related to the total mass by  =

8g3m3, where g3 is the three-dimensional newtons constant  see, for example, [9].
we will show in section 3.3 that m3 is equal to the four-dimensional mass m4 of the black
hole for all . for small , g4m4 is just  (as suggested by the horizon area). to compare
with m3 we must relate g3 to the four-dimensional newtons constant g4 as in eq. (2.8).
for n = 3, one has

g3 =

g4
2

(3.13)

from (3.11), the decit angle5 is 8g3m3 =  = 4 which implies m3 = /g4 = m4.

after we introduce the brane, the area of the event horizon is given by an integral

like (3.12), but instead of integrating from x1 to x2, one has twice the integral from 0
to x2. it is easy to see that when   1 the answer is essentially unchanged. the event
horizon extends o the brane zmax  2, which for   1, gives a good approximation
to the proper distance which the horizon extends o the brane. hence the geometry in

the neighborhood of these small black holes is essentially the same as that for spherical

four-dimensional schwarzschild black holes.

we now investigate what happens when   1. there is an apparent puzzle in
that there is an upper limit on the mass in 2 + 1 gravity coming from the fact that the

5 this is the deviation from 2 which is appropriate for determining the mass on the brane.

the decit angle at x = x1 is twice as big.

12

decit angle cannot exceed 2. the latter implies m3,max = 1/(4g3) = /(2g4). this
would correspond to a four-dimensional mass whose schwarzschild radius is of order the
ads radius. (when   1, the four-dimensional mass is no longer proportional to .)
nevertheless, we now show that there is no limit to the size of the black hole that can be

produced on the brane.

when   1, the function g(x) in (3.2) has only one real root at approximately

x2 =

1

(2)1/3

(3.14)

as we are in the regime x > 1/33 for the original solution without the brane (3.1), x now
has the range y < x  x2, and the surfaces of constant y are all topologically r2. since
there is only one axis, there is no conical singularity, provided we identify  with period

(3.3)

 =

4

3(2)1/3

(3.15)

the event horizon at y = y0 = 1/(2) has innite area, and as noted above corresponds
to a semi-innite black string extending to innity. note that as x can still approach y as
y  , the curvature singularity now also extends out to asymptotic innity.

we now make the same construction as before, slicing this solution along the surface

x = 0. the above argument about the extrinsic curvature still applies and shows that we
can match two copies of the region 0  x  x2 along the surface x = 0. since   0 as
  , m3 approaches its maximum value in this limit. the area of the event horizon is
now nite

and becomes arbitrarily large as   . in the poincare coordinates (3.5), the metric
on the brane is still given by (3.8). so the horizon is located at r = 2, and has proper

circumference

c = 2 =

4

3

(2)2/3

(3.17)

thus for large black holes, one nds a  2c. it is as if the black hole extends a distance 
o the brane on each side. in fact, the black hole extends much farther, but its contribution

to the area is suppressed by the ads geometry  see discussion in section 4. the black
hole extends to zmax = (1 + 2x2)  (2)2/3, but this corresponds to a proper distance
lz   log(2). while lz is much larger than the ads scale , it is still much smaller
than the extent of the horizon on the brane r = 2. hence the large black hole looks like

a = 22z x2

(2)2/3

(3.16)

a attened pancake. this naive discussion can actually be supported by a more general

analysis which we will describe in section 4.

3.3. black hole thermodynamics

we would now like to consider the thermodynamic properties of these black holes

on the brane. consider rst the hawking temperature. this is most easily calculated

by analytically continuing the time coordinate and xing the periodicity of the euclidean

section by requiring that the geometry is smooth at the horizon [17]. since the tem-

perature is constant over the horizon, we can calculate it on the brane, where the metric

is (3.8). given the (t,r) part of this metric is identical to the standard four-dimensional

schwarzschild geometry, we may immediately write

t =

1

8

.

(3.18)

while this result looks like the standard four-dimensional result, it diers since we will see

that the actual mass is not proportional to .

next we have the black hole entropy which is determined by the four-dimensional area

s = a
4g4

=

2

2g4 z x2

0

dx

(x  y0)2 =

422

1

g4

(1 + 2x2)(1 + 3x2)

(3.19)

where again x2 is the positive root of g(x) in eq. (3.2). for small , x2  1 as in
eq. (3.10) and  = g4m4, and so we recover the result for a schwarzschild black hole with
4 . on the other hand in the large  regime, one nds s = 22(2)2/3/(3g4)
s  4g4m 2
from eq. (3.16).

using the rst law of black hole thermodynamics

m = t s ,

(3.20)

we can dene a four-dimensional thermodynamic mass to the black hole6. that is, we

need only integrate this dierential relation up from zero mass and area to nite values.

this may seem a dicult task, given that the entropy (3.19) depends on x2, the root of
cubic equation. however, the problem becomes simpler when we introduce the auxiliary

variable x = 2x2 which satises

x2(1 + x) = 42 .

(3.21)

6 since our solutions are not asymptotically ads in the usual sense, one cannot dene the

black hole mass from the standard asymptotic formulas.

14

in terms of this variable the entropy (3.19) and the temperature become

s =

2
g4

x2
1 + 3

2 x

,

t =

1

4

1

x1 + x

.

(3.22)

it is now relatively straightforward to integrate the rst law (3.20) with the nal result

that

g4m4 =



2 (cid:18)1 

1 + x
1 + 3

2 x(cid:19) .

(3.23)

one can readily verify that this mass formula is monotonic in x. for small  (and hence
small x  2), one recovers

g4m4 

x
2   .

(3.24)

(3.25)

perhaps more surprising is that for large  (and hence large x  (2)2/3), one nds

g4m4 



2 (cid:18)1 

2

3(2)1/3(cid:19) .

hence for large , which corresponds to black holes with arbitrarily large horizon area,

there is a limiting mass g4m4,max = /2. using (3.13), this agrees exactly with the
limiting mass in three dimensions g3m3,max = 1/4 coming from the fact that the decit
angle cannot exceed 2:

m3,max = m4,max .

(3.26)

one is then emboldened to compare the generic mass formula for three dimensions to

eq. (3.23). essentially, one must express the mass in terms of the auxiliary variable x

which yields

g3m3 =

1
8

1
(2  ) =
4 
1 + x
2 x(cid:19) .
1 + 3

1

4 (cid:18)1 

=

1

2|g(x2)|

(3.27)

again using eq. (3.13), one nds that the three-dimensional mass calculated in terms of

the decit angle on the asymptotic brane geometry corresponds precisely to the four-

dimensional mass calculated using the relations of black hole mechanics.

note that a physicist conned to the brane would see a horizon at r = 2 with a
proper circumference c = 2, where for general ,  = 4/[x(1 + 3/2 x)]. hence
she may be tempted to ascribe an entropy of

s3 = c
4g3

=


2g3

x(1 + x)
1 + 3
2 x

.

15

(3.28)

using eq. (3.13) to compare this expression with that in eq. (3.22), we nd that s3 yields
approximately the correct result for large x, that is large . this remarkable agreement is

because in this regime the black hole horizons are essentially attened pancakes extending

roughly a distance  o of the brane. the fact that the black hole entropy is not exactly
c/4g3 should not be a surprise given that there are no black holes in pure 2 + 1 gravity
without a cosmological constant. the presence of the horizon is already an indication of

four-dimensional physics. since the three- and four-dimensional masses coincide as well

as the hawking temperatures on the brane and in the bulk, a at-world observer could

compute the black hole entropy by integrating the rst law. hence she could infer infor-

mation about the four-dimensional black hole horizon area from these three-dimensional

observations.

4. discussion

we have discussed exact four-dimensional solutions of einsteins equation with nega-

tive cosmological constant describing localized black holes bound to a two-brane. at large

distances along the brane, one recovers three-dimensional gravity. this conrms ideas of

randall and sundrum in a lower dimensional context, where explicit solutions are avail-

able. intuitively, one can understand the origin of lower dimensional gravity in this case

as follows. a black hole or any mass on the planck brane is accelerating, and before the

brane is introduced, one needs a mechanism to support this acceleration. in the original

ads c-metric, this force is supplied by a semi-innite cosmic string. at large transverse

distance from this string, the gravitational eld is described by 2 + 1 gravity. the proce-

dure of removing the cosmic string and introducing the brane does not change the solution

o the brane. by continuity, the metric on the brane asymptotically will still be described

by 2 + 1 gravity. in other words, the boundary conditions on the brane are the same as

the ones coming from a semi-innite cosmic string.

our results conrm that the singularities that arise when considering just the zero

mode in the randall-sundrum scenario are physically irrelevant. localized sources gener-

ate localized gravitational elds which fall o near the ads horizon. in fact, since the ads

horizon is innitely far away in spatial directions, the eld due to sources on the brane is

strictly zero at the ads horizon  the horizon geometry is unchanged.

even though we recover 2 +1 gravity asymptotically, there can be deviations at rather

large scales. in fact, even though there are no black holes in pure 2 + 1 gravity, the metric

16

on the brane describes a black hole with a horizon size that can be arbitrarily large. as

we have seen, there is a maximum possible mass in 2 + 1 gravity, and as one approaches

this maximum value, the horizon size diverges. if one starts with a distribution of matter

on the brane with mass close to the maximum value, it will form a black hole at very low

density. as we have discussed, it is also true that arbitrarily large four-dimensional black

holes can be produced with nite total energy.

it is possible that these solutions have

implications that go beyond the randall-sundrum scenario.

throughout this paper we have been considering a model with single (positive tension)

brane with an innite transverse direction [1]. there is another related model [3] where two

membranes are introduced, one with positive tension (the invisible brane) and another

one with negative tension, where the visible world is supposed to reside. the transverse

dimension is compact in this model, as it is bounded by these two membranes. we want

now to investigate what the eect of a black hole localized on the visible brane is. to

model this situation, we can slice our solution (3.1) at x = 0, but this time we discard

the region x > 0 instead of x < 0 as we did before. then we paste it to a copy of

itself along x = 0, so the resulting brane has negative tension (for the purpose of this

discussion we do not need to worry about the invisible brane). however, if we now want

to eliminate the conical singularity in the resulting spacetime we have to x  to ensure

the geometry is smooth on the axis x = x1, instead of x = x2 (at least for small , when x1
is real). this produces a conical excess asymptotically on the brane, i.e., a negative mass
on the brane! moreover this mass approaches  as the black string regime is reached.
therefore, this two-membrane model produces negative mass black holes on the brane out

of four-dimensional black holes with positive mass. in our construction, this is due to the

negative tension of the cosmic string that is now pushing on the black hole in the original

ads c-metric (3.1) before the brane is introduced. this is an explicit realization of claims

that these models produce anti-gravity on the visible brane [4].

at this point the most important question is what are the implications of our results

to the more realistic ve-dimensional context. it seems likely that the gravitational eld

of a black hole on a three-brane will again fall o far from the brane to leave the ads

horizon nonsingular (and, in fact, unchanged). extending our results to n+1 dimensions,

we expect that approaching the horizon at xed radius, the fall-o of the metric to be
identical to an (n + 1)-dimensional black hole, i.e., gn+1m/zn2 for large z. this then
is the additional fall o beyond the overall factor of 2/z2 in the ads metric. the latter

17

corresponds to the prole of a zero-mode excitation, as discussed in section 2. hence

thinking in terms of a mode expansion, the kaluza-klein modes eectively smooth out the

zero-mode contribution, to produce the more dramatic decay of the gravitational eld and

to avoid the appearance of any singularity at the horizon.

a higher dimensional black hole will also modify the asymptotic gravitational eld on

the brane. in analogy with our four-dimensional solutions, we expect a ve-dimensional
black hole to introduce g4m/r2 corrections to the g4m/r gravitational potential on the
three-brane, in contrast to the 2g4m/r3 corrections predicted in [1]. these corrections
would still be negligible for solar mass black holes. similarly in the (n+1)-dimensional

construction for gravity on an (n1)-brane in section 2, the leading potential on the brane
is gnm/rn3, and the leading correction would be proportional to gnm/rn2. hence
these still become insignicant for distances r >  on the brane. in our lower dimensional
example, we found that signicant deviations extended out to r  , which can be
signicantly larger than the ads scale  alone. again this is an artifact of 2+1 dimensions,

where there are no deviations from atness to compete with the deviations arising from

the higher dimensions.

it is interesting to compare the corrections to the newtonian potential to those which

might arise due to higher curvature interactions. let us consider the simplest case of

adding a curvature-squared interaction to einstein gravity in n dimensions, i.e., consider

the eective action

i =

1

16gn z dnx (cid:0)r + 2

c rrrr(cid:1)

(4.1)

where the length c would be proportional to some cut-o scale. to leading order, the
gravitational potential corresponds to that of einstein gravity with h  gnm/rn3,
which then induces curvatures of the order rr  gnm/rn1 (both in an appropriate
asymptotically at frame). schematically then these curvatures introduce a new source
term in the modied eld equations of the form: 2h  2
c 2r. hence one expects
cgnm/rn1. we
the corrections to the gravitational potential to be of the order h
remark that this result agrees with those from an explicit detailed analysis, e.g., [18]. hence
we see these corrections are suppressed by 2
c/r2 relative to the leading newtonian terms,
which is higher order compared to the /r suppression appearing in the randall-sundrum

  2

geometry.

actually, for the case of n = 4, the suppression of contributions arising from higher

curvature interactions is even stronger than the schematic analysis above indicates. we

18

did not consider interactions involving the ricci tensor or scalar, i.e., rr or r2, since
their contributions vanish by the leading order equations of motion. hence in the eective

action (4.1), the curvature squared interaction is equivalent to the four-dimensional euler

density which would include additional ricci squared terms. however, since the later is a
topological term in four dimensions, it will not aect the equations of motion for n = 4.7
hence a detailed analysis [18] would show that the correction 2
cgnm/rn1 appearing in
the schematic analysis comes with a coecient of precisely zero for n = 4. hence to

produce a nonvanishing result in four dimensions, one would have to consider a curvature
c(g4m )2/r6. in any
cubed interaction which would then give rise to a correction h
event, this is greatly suppressed compared to the g4m/r2 correction that appears in the
randall-sundrum scenario.

  4

we might comment that experimental tests have already probed the 1/r2 corrections

to the newtonian gravitational potential  see e.g., [20]. these observations are in good

agreement with einstein gravity, which by itself predicts post-newtonian corrections of
the form (g4m )2/r2 because of the nonlinearities of the gravitational eld equations. of
course, in the context of solar system tests or any astrophysical context, we can expect
that these einstein corrections will swamp the brane-world corrections since g4m  .

just as in section 3.3, one can expect that the thermodynamic properties of (n+1)-

dimensional black holes bound to the planck brane will closely approximate those of black

holes arising in n-dimensional einstein gravity, at least for large black holes. in the latter

case, the black hole geometry on the brane will closely resemble that of an einstein solution

in n-dimensions, and so the surface gravity or hawking temperature will be very close to the
expected value. the corrections will be suppressed by (gnm )1/(n3). one of the striking
results in this section was that the four-dimensional thermodynamic mass agreed precisely

with the standard asymptotic mass calculated on the brane. it would be interesting to see

if this result extends to higher dimensions.

in section 3.3, we found that the naive three-dimensional entropy c/4g3 matched
quite well with s = a/4g4 for large black holes  all the more surprising since we did
not have a three-dimensional theory of gravity with black holes. in fact, this remarkable

agreement is expected to hold in arbitrary dimensions. the point is that most of the area

on the higher dimensional event horizon comes from a region very near to the planck brane.

7 this is precisely the same cancellation which renders pure einstein gravity in four dimensions

nite at one-loop [19].

19

consider approximating the area of a large (n+1)-dimensional black hole as a cylinder

which extends from the brane at z =  to zmax with xed radius r, and then closes o with
a disk with xed z = zmax. first, note that the circumference of the horizon measured
on the brane is

c = rn2n2

(4.2)

where n2 is the area of a unit (n2)-sphere. now, the contribution to the (n+1)-
dimensional area from the cylinder is

ac = 2rn2n2 z zmax



z(cid:19)n1
(cid:18) 

dz

2
n  2
while the contribution of the disk is

=

rn2n2h1  (/zmax)n2i

ad =

2

n  2

rn1n2 (/zmax)n1 .

(4.3)

(4.4)

hence if the horizon extends into the bulk such that /zmax  1, one has to leading order
that

now further using the relation (2.8) between the newtons constants on the brane and in

the bulk, one has

s = a

4gn+1

= c
4gn

.

(4.6)

hence we see that the ads geometry conspires to reproduce precisely the black hole entropy

of n-dimensional einstein gravity.

of course, one does not expect the correspondence (4.6) of the bulk and brane entropies

will continue to hold for small black holes. as indicated in eqs. (4.3) and (4.4), there are

corrections to the relation (4.5), which are suppressed by /zmax, revealing the higher
dimensional nature of the black hole. of course, the crude model above will not give the

detailed form of these corrections. in passing, we note that for black strings constructed by

letting g in eq. (2.1) be an n-dimensional black hole, as in [21], these corrections vanish
since zmax  . hence the correspondence (4.6) of the black hole entropy calculated in
the bulk and on the planck brane would be exact.

on quite general grounds one expects the surface gravity to be constant over the event

horizon [22], and so the hawking temperature will be the same on the brane and in the bulk

20

a =

2

n  2c .

(4.5)

spacetime. however, it appears that large black holes will prefer to radiate in the brane.

this is not just because of the large number of species of particles on the brane compared to
just gravity in the bulk. one can crudely estimate the decay rate as dm/dt  at d, where
a is the horizon area and d is the relavent spacetime dimension. hence, for example,
for a large schwarzschild black hole of radius r0 on the three-brane, with d = 4 and
t  1/r0, we have the usual result dm/dt  1/r2
0. from the ve-dimensional standpoint,
d = 5 and the area will be approximately r2
0  as above. thus gravitational hawking
radiation into the bulk would contribute dm/dt  /r3
0, which will be much smaller.
small black holes will behave dierently. when g4m < , the black hole behaves like
if the radius of the event horizon is r0, one
a ve-dimensional schwarzschild solution.
still has t  1/r0. hence the four-dimensional radiation still yields dm/dt  1/r2
0. the
ve-dimensional area is now approximately r3
0, and so the bulk radiation also contributes
dm/dt  1/r2
0. however in this case, the latter contribution is smaller because the black
hole only radiates into the bulk with a single species, i.e., the ve-dimensional graviton,

while the brane radiation involves all of the species of brane-matter elds. still, for these

small black holes, one should expect that the relation between r0 and 2g4m is modied,
and so the evolution of these small black holes would in principle be distinguishable from

that those in pure einstein gravity. this may then have implications for primordial black

holes [23].

in section 3.2, we found that the geometry of large black holes resembled a attened

pancake. note that on purely dimensional grounds, one can expect that for large gnm

zmax  (cid:0)gnm/n3(cid:1)

(4.7)

for some constant . from this observation (independent of the value of ), one nds as

a robust result that the proper distance that these black holes extend o of the planck

brane is

lz   log(cid:0)gnm/n3(cid:1) .

(4.8)

hence one can expect quite generally that for large black holes, lz is larger than the
ads scale , but still much smaller than the extent of the horizon on the brane r 
(gnm )1/(n3). hence these large black holes will always have a pancake geometry.

the authors of [21] presented the interesting idea that the physical extent of the black

holes o of the planck brane is related to the gregory-laamme instability [24]. suppose

we start with the black string described by (2.1) where g is the metric of a black hole

21

of mass m . since the proper distances on surfaces of constant z are shrinking as r = r/z

due to the ads geometry, we have an eective mass scale at nite z of

(gnm ) = (/z)n3gnm .

(4.9)

the idea in [21] is that the horizon then can not extend far past the limit where (gnm ) 
n3, otherwise it becomes long and narrow, and the gregory-laamme instability would

arise due to long-wavelength metric uctuations. the cut-o arises because the conning

nature of the ads geometry only allows wavelengths shorter than . if we assume that the
instability sets in right at (gnm )  n3, we nd

and then

zmax = (cid:0)gnm/n3(cid:1)1/(n3)

(4.10)

(4.11)

lz 

log(cid:0)gnm/n3(cid:1) .



n  3

hence this suggestion [21] yields a result consistent with (4.8), and again predicts a

pancake-like geometry for large black holes on the planck brane.

to construct an exact solution describing a black hole bound to a three-brane, one

would need to start with a ve-dimensional analog of the c-metric. unfortunately, such

a metric is not yet known. however, the following qualitative features must be present.

to accelerate the black hole, one needs an analog of the cosmic string.

in four spatial

dimensions, if one compresses a string of matter to make it thinner and thinner, it will

eventually form a horizon and become a black string. thus we expect a vacuum solution

describing an accelerating ve-dimensional black hole to actually contain a black string.

if the string were too thin, it would break up into individual black holes [24]. so the

thickness of the black string must be at least comparable to the ads scale. this is similar

to the picture arrived at in [21]. once one has the accelerating black string solution, one

should be able to cut o the asymptotic region and introduce a three-brane as we did in

lower dimensions.
