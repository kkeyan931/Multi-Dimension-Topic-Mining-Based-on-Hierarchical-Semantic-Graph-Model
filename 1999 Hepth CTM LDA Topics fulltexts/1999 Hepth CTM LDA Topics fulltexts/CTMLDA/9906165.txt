(second article ) obtain anomaly heat kernel approach, soo {$9805090$} chang soo {$9905001$}, apply pauli-villars technique standard diagramatic approach, {$97$}, anomaly obtained atiyah-singer index using supersymmetry. so, apart puzzling fact one authors comment also coauthor paper obukhov et al., clear result demonstratedly incorrect. 1 view number unproven false statements comment would like point out. result, main claim comment cannot substantiated. analyze statements one one appear text. 1)(section i, second paragraph) fact anomaly stable radiative corrections guarantees given topological interpretation. response: order reversed: anomaly stable perturbative corrections topological invariant. 2)(third paragraph) ...there doubt ny term possibly generated, demonstrated previously ,.. response: claried second article ref.  precede ours. stated abstract ref. , following chandia zanelli, two spaces non-trivial translational chern-simons forms discussed. demonstrate, rstly within classical einstein-cartan-dirac theory secondly quantum heat kernel approach dirac operator, nieh-yan form surfaces contexts, contrast assumed previously.. moreover, although ny form found rst article ref.  ref. , identied topological invariant mixed dozens terms collectively discarded irrelevant. so, say refs.  demonstrated ny term undoubtedly generated gross overstatement. set record straight, rst point topological ny-four form generated einstein-cartan spaces. 3)(third fourth paragraphs) rescaling tetrad, authors ref. {$9702025$} ignore presence renormalization conditions generation scale upon renormal- ization. rescaling tetrad would ultimately change wave function renormalization z-factor...this factor creeps denition ny term quantum level, thus rescaling tetrad achieve desired goals... renormalization condition available ny term, methods obtaining zero, conclude  delivers ny term. or, saying dierently, nite value zero renormalization. 2 response: anomaly calculations assume given background necessarily quantized quantized chiral eld. pertubative radiative corrections cannot change topological density, function background eld . then, sucient check result topological invariant (including scale invariance, course), order sure renormalize. kreimer et al. show paper elsewhere rescaled nieh-yan four form, l2 topological invariant, shown renormalization claim. hence, ground claim result spurious erased renormalization. 4) (section ii, third paragraph) since coframe translational part cartan connection... response: identication rests assumption tangent space poincare ber. since minkowski space scale, identifying vielbein connection associated translations slippery issue: vierbein dimensions length, connection dimensionless. hence, one forced introduce articial length scale scale invariant space. instead, would prefer identify tangent space manifold constant curvature (a)ds local invariance. advantage naturally dened length scale l (radius curvature). 5) (fourth paragraph)the corresponding cs term c spplits via c = crr 2ct linear one translations, see footnote 31 ref. . relation recently recovered chandia zanelli {$9702025$}. response: wording use quotation marks meant imply appropriated idea found ref.  without acknowledging it. splitting recovered present authors much authors ref. . rst mentioned original papers nieh yan , discussed also, several years prior ref. , paper a. mardones j. zanelli . clear literature paper, topological nature ny invariant relationship chern classes so(5) so(4), much less, relevance 3 chiral anomaly. 6) (section iii, second paragraph) decomposed lagrangian (3.1) leads fol- lowing form dirac equation + = (cid:20)d{} + 4 + 4 a5(cid:21) = 0 (3.2) terms riemannian connection {} d{} = 0 irreducible piece (2.3) torsion. hence, rc spacetime dirac operator feel axial torsion one-form a. also seen identity (3.6.13) ref.  specializes shell commutation relation  = {} + 4 5da 8 m2. (3.3) response: although shell dirac operator clearly dened, true components torsion appear dirac equation (3.2), contribute interaction. expression commutator incorrect. correct form found literature easily checked  = 1 4 j abj cdrab cd j abe ae b e c c d. clearly, one uses shell relations, one could cancel part second term rhs. problem justify using shell relations dont go quantum regime. precisely last term gives rise nieh-yan form fujikawa method, obviously could reproduced starting (3.3). 7) (fifth paragraph) einsteins equations ... purely algebraic cartan relation... one nds dj5 = 4dct = 2 l2 (cid:16)t + r (cid:17) (3.4) establishes link ny four form, massive elds. response: three remarkable points here: rst spite relation, authors continue believe rc spacetime dirac operator 4 feel axial torsion one-form (see 6, above). time violation fermionic chiral current due interaction torsion ny torsional term?. second point use einstein equations. einstein equations relevant problem? fact, well known, integrability condition dirac operator precisely einsteins quations (in particular, local supersymmetry requires gravity, one way supergravity arises). thus, computed integrability condition correctly, would found einsteins equations rest argument would follow naturally. third remarkable point claim result valid massive elds only. puzzling mass parameter (3.4) nothing seems prevent taking limit 0. last observation shows must something shy next claim: 8) (sixth paragraph)in limit 0, nd within dynamical framework ecd theory ny four-form tends zero shell, i.e. dct = (1/4)dj5 0. response: again, suspect shell relations invoked justify otherwise irreproducible result, relation links dj5 mass shell equations. concentrate last term  4 5 ] lagrangian... term regarded external axial covector ... coupled axial current j5 dirac eld initially spacetime. applying result (11-225) itzykson zuber..., nd term da da arises axial anomaly, ny type term = dct recently claimed {$9702025$}. response: calculation itzykson zuber (i-z) would valid commutation relations form (3.3), unfortunately, said 6), case. eq. (3.3) valid shell, insucient apply i-z result, especially supposed quantum calculation. i-z approach wrong, designed handle dirac operator satises complicated relation 5 rc spaces, rederived order apply case, something kreimer mielke didnt do. purposes work, u(1) anomaly completely standard cannot yield anything new already, say, electrodynamics. particular, since 3 trivial {$9702025$}, presence gauged away. 10) (fifth paragraph) whereas n = 4 dimensions pontrjagin type term k4 dimensionless, term k2 2l2dct carries dimensions. consistently absorbed counterterm, thus discarded nal result anomaly. response: kreimer mielke provide proof claim. exhibit counterterm radiative corrections give rise it. although often refer renormalization counterterms, single one-loop calculation found anywhere paper. 11) (seventh paragraph)in ref. {$9702025$} argued contributions main- tained absorbing divergent factor rescaled coframe := propose consider wigner-inonu contraction de sitter gauge approach {$97$}, ml xed. response: true. propose rescaling. observe one replaces (ml)1 , result reads, a(x) = 1 82 (cid:20)rab rab + 2 l2 (t ta rab ea eb)(cid:21) . (1) this, language kreimer mielke equal dcrr + dct , chern class so(5). 12) (ninth paragraph) 1. dierence (2.1) two pontrjagin classes, term dct topological invariant all. now, actually term appears torsion-dependent extra contribution anomaly, precisely = 2l2dct . thus, measuring proportion units topological invariant dct , nd vanishes consider proposed limit , keeping ml constant. response: redenition (ml)1, change units (assuming c 6 h dimensionless). scaling properties ct = l2a ta depend l supposed scale. elds properly dened, one-form dimensions length therefore l1 dimensionless, like well dened connection one-form. then, ct , dct anomaly scale invariant should. 13) (tenth eleventh paragraphs) ...consistently renormalization condition imposed guarantees anomaly  value. even one renders extra term nite rescaling ref. {$9702025$}, one confront fact (nite) renormalization condition imposed settles anomaly value.... renormalization group point view, scaling coupling determines scaling anomaly... property  adler-bardeen theorem. or, put otherwise, anomaly stable radiative corrections reason corrections compensated renormalization coupling. while, hand, topological invariant ref. {$9702025$} property, interpretation anomaly seems dubious us. response: easily seen, kreimer mielkes comment warning problems one might encounter proof something wrong actually done. produce evidence support contention, end sceptical remark. honest claim entire comment (even incorrect topological invariant ref. {$9702025$} possess property would like have). opinion, limited last line. 14) (fifth section) kreimer mielke essentially repeat claims without adding new arguments. conclusion, summarize following points: authors comment argue fact ny term present chiral anomaly shown. b challenge contribution nieh-yan topological invariant, grounds nd manipulations use shell conditions. c furthermore claim radiative corrections renormalize ny term 7 zero, although produce evidence (e.g., loop corrections eective action, etc.). claim rests scaling argument, according ny term scales mass, incorrect best arbitrary. criticize rescaling argument attribute us nowhere found paper. acknowledgments work partially supported grants 1970151, 1980788 1990189 fondecyt-chile, grant 98/02380-3 fapesp-brasil grant 27-9531zi dicyt-usach. institutional support fuerza aerea de chile group chilean companies (afp provida, business design associates, cge, codelco, copec, empre- sas cmpc, gener s.a., minera collahuasi, minera escondida, novagas xerox- chile) also recognized. 8
