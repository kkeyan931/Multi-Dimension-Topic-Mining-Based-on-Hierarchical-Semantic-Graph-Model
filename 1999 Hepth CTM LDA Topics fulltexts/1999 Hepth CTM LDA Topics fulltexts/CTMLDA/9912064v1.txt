abstract

we study the properties of the topologically nontrivial doublet solution arisen in the biscalar
theory with a fourth-power potential introducing an example of the spontaneous breaking of
symmetry. we rule out the zero-brane (non-minimal point particle) action for this doublet as a
particle with curvature. when quantizing it as the theory with higher derivatives, we calculate
the quantum corrections to the mass of the doublet which could not be obtained by means of
the perturbation theory.

1 introduction

the kink solution is known to be the soliton (more correctly, solitary wave) solution appearing in
the 2d relativistic 4 one-scalar model and admitting an interpretation in terms of a particle. its
classical and quantum properties are already studied in a number of works [1, 2, 3]. however,
the majority of recent theories contains the multiscalar 4 theories (e.g., the scalar sector of
the weinberg-salam model contains such a complex biscalar theory). therefore, the increasing
of internal space dimensions and studying of classical and quantum features of multiscalar
theories seems to be of great necessity and interest. thus, the aim of this paper is to study
the topologically nontrivial solution of the biscalar 4 theory within the frameworks of the
method developed (and applied to a one-scalar case) in ref.
[2]. this approach consists in
the constructing of brane action where the non-minimal terms (rst of all, depending on the
world-volume curvature) are induced by the eld uctuations in the neighborhood of the static
solution. of course, these uctuations are required to be reasonably small, and then the eective
zero-brane action evidently arises after nonlinear reparametrization of an initial theory when
excluding zero eld oscillations.

the paper is arranged as follows. in sec. 2 we study the kink-bell doublet solution and its
properties on the classical level. in sec. 3 we perform the nonlinear parametrization of the initial
action by means of the bogolyubov transformation to the collective degrees of freedom. after
this, minimizing the action with respect to eld uctuations, we remove zero modes and obtain
the eective action having the minimal and non-minimal (curvature) terms. sec. 4 is devoted
to quantization of this action as a constrained theory with higher derivatives. we calculate the
rst excited level to obtain the mass of the doublet with quantum corrections.

the eld doublet (6) has the localized energy density

in subsequent sections we will deepen this interpretation both at classical (considering eld
uctuations) and quantum levels.

finally, some comments upon relations between one- and two-scalar 4 theories are in order.
the single scalar eld theory with the coupling constant of an arbitrary sign is described by the

where the last term is introduced in such a way that the potential energy would be equal zero
in the appropriate local minimum point. at  < 0 the state  = 0 is the most energetically
favorable whereas at  > 0 the states  =  turn to be favorable thus realizing the simplest
spontaneous breaking of symmetry. further, at  > 0 this theory admits the kink as the only
solution having localized energy. however, at  < 0 the bell solution (like (s)
2 ) appears to be
the only solution with localized energy. with respect to energy the theory with  < 0 has both
the unphysical unbounded from below states and the physical ones (including the bell soliton)
localized near a local minimum point which are stable against reasonably small eld uctuations.
thus, in the one-scalar theory the kink and bell solutions cannot exist together, whereas one
can see that in the biscalar theory (1) they successfully coexist as a doublet within the same
range of coupling parameters.

3 eective action

in this section we will construct the nonlinear eective action of the biscalar 4 theory about
the kink-bell doublet (6). let us change to the set of the collective coordinates {0 = s, 1 = }
such that
(9)

xm = xm(s) + em

where xm(s) turn to be the coordinates of a (1+1)-dimensional point particle, em
(1)(s) is the unit
spacelike vector orthogonal to the world line. hence, the action (1) can be rewritten in new
coordinates as

(1)(s), a(x, t) = ea(),

(10)

where

s[e] =z l(e)  d2,
2  (ea)2#  u(e),
2xa "(sea)2
l(e) =
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
 = det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
k(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
=  x2(1  k),

xm

and k is the curvature of a particle world line

k =

mn xm xn
( x2)3

,

(11)

where mn is the unit antisymmetric tensor. this new action contains the two redundant degrees
of freedom which eventually lead to appearance of the so-called zero modes. to eliminate them
we must constrain the model by means of the condition of vanishing of the functional derivative
with respect to the doublet eld uctuations about some chosen static solution (kink-bell in our
case), and in result we will obtain the required eective action [2].

so, the uctuations of the elds ea() in the neighborhood of the static solution (s)

given by the expression

a () are

substituting them into eq. (10) and considering the static equation of motion (4) for (s)
have

a k x2 = o(2),

(14)

which has to be the constraint removing redundant degrees of freedom. supposing a(s, ) =
k(s)fa(), in the linear approximations k  1 (which naturally guarantees also the smoothness
of a world line at   0) and o(2) = 0 we obtain the system of three ordinary derivative
equations

first of all, we are needed to nd the solutions of (16) such that eld uctuations would be
damping at both innities (then the integral at a non-minimal term below will be nite). in
other words, we suppose the boundary conditions

which evidently correspond to the singular stourm-liouville problem describing bound states of
some quantum system. further, varying the orbit equation (7) we obtain the expression

fa(+) = fa() = o(1),

one can separate fa in (16) by virtue of. thus, we have the two independent stourm-liouville
problems which can be resolved exactly and completely. the following theorem has to be very
useful in this connection.

then the corresponding stourm-liouville problem,

f (+) = f () = o(1),

(19)

has the only solution for each :

f (=+1) =

k sinhu + 1

3cosh2u

,

f (=1) =

sinhu + b
3cosh2u

,

thereby the corresponding eigenvalues are

c = 3,

where b and k are arbitrary integration constants.1

with the use of this theorem we obtain that the solutions of system (16) provided (17) are
the two sets of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues which will be distinguished by virtue of a hat

hence one can see that eq.
k  1, as was expected.
thus, the considering of eld uctuations naturally leads to the splitting of the kink-bell
doublet into the two subtypes in dependence on the constant before the non-minimal term k2.
however, when studying the quantum aspects of the model we will nd that the absolute value
of mass (even with quantum corrections) does not depend on the sign of c, the energy of the
non-minimal particle with n = 1 lies in the lower energy continuum and hence can be interpreted
in terms of antiparticles. therefore, below we will assume n = 0, i.e.,  = /6m2.

1the proof is not very complicated but too bulky hence it is not presented here (see ref. [5] for the proof of similar theorem).

4 quantization

in the previous section we obtained a classical eective action for the model in question. thus, to
quantize it we must consecutively construct the hamiltonian structure of dynamics of the point
particle with curvature. from eqs. (11) and (21) one can see that we have the theory with higher
derivatives [6]. hence, below we will treat the coordinates and momenta as the canonically
independent coordinates of phase space. besides, the hessian matrix, constructed from the
derivatives with respect to accelerations, appears to be singular that says about the presence of
the constraints on phase variables of the theory. following the quantization procedure proposed
in ref. [2] and developed in ref. [5] one can obtain the equation for discrete mass spectrum in
the form

where

 =qb(b  1)(n + 1/2) + o(h2), n = 0, 1, 2, ...,

3 s 2 + 2
82

m

b =

m,  =

3

2

m2  1 

m

 ! ,

(24)

(25)

and m is the total mass of the kink-bell doublet as a non-minimal point particle with curvature.
further, again following [5], the rst quantum correction to particle masses will be determined

by the lower energy of oscillations:

 =

1

2qb(b  1) + o(h2),

that gives the algebraic equation for m as a function of m and .

we can easily resolve it in the approximation of weak coupling. assuming   m2/2  0
(or, equivalently, b  1) in such a way that the value m2 remains to be nonzero we nd eq.
(25) in the form

which after all yields

 =

b
2

+ o(h2),

(m  )2 =

3
4

m2


m + o(h2).

then one can seek for mass in the form m =  +  (  ), and nally we obtain

3
2

m =  

m + o(h2).

(26)

(27)

(28)

thus, the mass of the doublet boson with quantum corrections reads in rst approximation

m =

42 + 8  33

6

m,

(29)

hence one can see that the main term in this expression turns to be singular at   0, therefore,
the obtained results are nonperturbative and can not be ruled out through the -series of the
perturbation theory.
