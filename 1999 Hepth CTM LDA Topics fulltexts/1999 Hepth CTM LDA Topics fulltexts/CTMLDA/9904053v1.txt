the velocity basis of the poincare group is used in the direct product space of two irreducible
unitary representations of the poincare group. the velocity basis with total angular momentum j
will be used for the denition of relativistic gamow vectors.

i. introduction

1 + p 

2(cid:1), representing resonance energy er and lifetime 

resonances are obtained in the scattering of two (or more) elementary particles, and quasistationary states decay
into a two (or many) particle system with masses mi and spins si, i = 1, 2 . relativistic resonances and decaying
states are therefore described in the direct product space of two irreducible representation spaces of the poincare
group h = h1(m1, s1)  h2(m2, s2). non-relativistic resonances and decaying states have been described by gamow
vectors [1]. gamow vectors are characterized by a value of angular momentum j in the center-of-mass frame and by a
complex energy zr = (cid:0)er  i 
 . they are generalized eigenvectors
in a rigged hilbert space   h   of the self-adjoint hamiltonian h with complex eigenvalue zr [1]. relativistic
resonances and unstable particles are characterized by their spin (total angular momentum in the center-of-mass frame
2(cid:1)2
of the decay products) and the value s = sr  (cid:0)mr  i 
of the invariant mass squared s = (p1 + p2)2 = (e2  p2)
where mr is the resonance mass and 
is its lifetime. we want to nd relativistic gamow vectors which are
r
generalized eigenvectors of the total mass operator m 2 = pp  = (p1 + p2)(p 
2 ) with complex eigenvalue sr
and with spin j. these must be obtained from the direct product space h1(m1, s1)  h2(m2, s2).
eigenspaces of m 2 with real values of invariant mass s and total angular momentum j are obtained by the relativistic
partial wave analysis [24] using the wigner basis, i.e., using momentum eigenvectors |pi, s3i(mi, si)i in the spaces
hi and eigenvectors |p, j3(s, j)i of p = p1 + p2 in the direct product space h.
in distinction to the non-relativistic case, in the relativistic case lorentz transformations intermingle energy and
momenta. if one wants to make an analytic continuation of s from the values (m1 + m2)2  s <  to the complex
values sr (of the pole position in the second sheet of the relativistic s-matrix sj(s)) this will also lead to complex
momenta. to restrict the unwieldy set of complex momentum representations [5] we want to construct complex mass
representations of the poincare group p whose momenta are minimally complex in the sense that though p and m
are complex, the 4-velocities p  p
m remain real. this can be carried out because, as explained in section 2, the 4-
velocity eigenvectors | p, j3(s, j)i provide as valid basis vectors for the representation space of p as the usual momentum
eigenvectors. moreover, they are more useful for physical reasoning than the momenta eigenvectors, because the 4-
velocities seem to fulll to rather good approximation velocity super-selection rules which the momenta do not
[6]. therefore we will use the velocity basis | pi, s3i(mi, si)i for the relativistic partial wave analysis and obtain the
clebsch-gordan coecients of the poincare group for the velocity basis. this is done in section 3 for s1 = s2 = 0,
which applies to the case of + in the nal state. this gives the velocity eigenvectors | p, j3(s, j)i of the direct
product space h = pj=0r 
(m1+m2)2 d(s)h(s, j) from which we obtain the four-velocity scattering states | p, j3(s, j)i
using the lippmann-schwinger equation as e.g., done in [7]. the relativistic gamow vectors | p, j3(sr, j)i will be
obtained in a subsequent paper from the scattering states by analytic continuation. in the appendix, we derive the
clebsch-gordan coecients for the velocity basis of p for the general case.

ii. velocity basis of the poincare group

we denote the ten generators of the unitary representation u(a, ) of (a, )  p, by

p , j 

,  = 0, 1, 2, 3 .

the standard choice of the invariant operators and of a complete set of commuting observables (c.s.c.o.) is

here

m 2 = pp  , w = w w,
pi (i = 1, 2, 3) , s3 = m1u(l(p)) w3 u1(l(p)) ,

w =

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

m1 is the inverse square root of the positive denite operator p p, and u(l(p)) is the representation of the boost
that depends upon the parameters p ( = 0, 1, 2, 3), which are the eigenvalues of the operators p. only three of
these parameters are independent in an irreducible representation, because of the relation m2 = pp. the standard
boost (rotation free) matrix l

(2.4)

(2.5)

one feature shown in (2.4) which we want to make use of, is that the boost l
upon the 4-velocity p
of eigenvectors of the c.s.c.o. (2.2) is the wigner basis usually denoted as

. (p) does not depend upon p but only
m  p. the complete basis system in the irreducible representation space h(m2, j) which consists

it has the transformation property under the translation (a, i) and the lorentz transformation (0, ) :

|p, j3(m, j)i .

where r is the wigner rotation

u(a, i)|p, j3i = eipa|p, j3i

u(0, )|p, i = x



|p, 

id (r(, p)) ,

r(, p) = l1(p)l(p) .

(2.6)

(2.7a)

(2.7b)

(2.7c)

the wigner rotation depends upon the 10 parameters of  and upon the parameters p = p
3 independent p and :

m . in an uir there are

1some of the references we use here have dierent convention, e.g.,      [7], and l1  l(p) [3].

2

where we have omitted the xed values m j as we shall often do in an uir. every vector (of a dense subspace of
physical states) of h(m, j) can be written according to diracs basis vector decomposition as

|p, j3i = u(l(p))|p = 0, j3i ,

(2.7d)

 = z d (p)x

|p, ihp,  | i ,

where one has many arbitrary choices for the measure. it is usually chosen to be given by

d (p) =  (p) d3p ,

(2.8a)

(2.8b)

where one can choose any (measurable) function , in particular a smooth function. the choice of  is connected to
the normalization of the dirac kets through :

one convention2 for  is the lorentz invariant measure :



h

, p | p, i =

1

 (p)

3(p  p)  .

 (p) =

1

2e(p)

, where e (p) = pm2 + p 2 .

(2.8c)

(2.8d)

the mathematically precise form of the dirac decomposition is the nuclear spectral theorem for the complete sys-
tem of commuting (essentially self-adjoint) operators. it is the same as (2.8), however with well dened mathematical
quantities. the state vectors  in (2.8a) must be elements of a dense subspace  of the representation space h of an
uir :

    h(m, j) ;

(2.9)

and the basis vectors |p, i   are elements of the space of antilinear functionals on  which fulll the condition :
(2.10a)

hpi | p, i = pi h | p, i

for every    .

this condition means the |p, i are generalized eigenvectors of pi, which is also written as

p i |p, i = pi |p, i ,

(2.10b)

is an extension of p i (= pi); and the component of  along the basis vector |p, i, the hp,  | i = h| p, i,
where p i
are antilinear continuous functionals f () = hp, |i on the space .
the space  is a dense nuclear subspace of h [9]. (e.g.,  could be chosen to be the subspace of dierentiable
vectors of h equipped with a nuclear topology dened by the countable number of norms : ||||p = p(, ( + 1)p),
where  = p p 2
  is the nelson operator [10]. but it could also be chosen as another dense nuclear
subspace of h.) the three spaces form a gelfand triplet, or rigged hilbert space

 + p

2 j 2

  h  

(2.11)

and the bra-ket < | > is an extension of the scalar product ( , ). the hp,  | i = h| p, i are the wigner momentum
wavefunctions.
the wigner kets (2.6) are not the only basis system of h(m, j) that one can use to expand every vector   .
for every dierent choice of c.s.c.o. in the enveloping algebra e(p) (the algebra generated by p, j ) one obtains a
dierent system of basis vectors; in this way one can obtain e.g., lorentz basis (eigenvectors of the casimir operators
of so(3, 1)j [3,9]), or the spinor basis (whose fourier transforms are the relativistic elds [7]) etc. we want to
choose still another basis system, which is similar to the wigner basis except that it is a basis of eigenvectors of the
4-velocity operator p  pm1 rather than the momentum operator p.

with the 4-velocity operator, one denes the operators

2this is the convention of [8,24], but not of [7]

and the spin tensor

the c.s.c.o. is then given by

w =

 p j  = wm1 ,

  =  p  w .

w =  w w =

  , m 2 ,

and we denote its generalized eigenvectors by

| p, j3; s = m2, ji ,

where p = p

m are the eigenvalues of p.

the basis vector expansion for every    with respect to the basis system (2.14) is given by

 = xj3

z d3 p

2p0 | p, j3ihj3, p| i ,

where we have chosen the invariant measure

d( p) =

d3 p
2p0 =

1
m2

d3p

2e(p)

as a consequence of (2.15b), the -function normalization of these velocity-basis vectors is

p0 = p1 + p2 .

h, p| p, i = 2p03( p  p) 

= 2p0m23(p  p)  .

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15a)

(2.15b)

(2.15c)

mathematically, every c.s.c.o. is equally valid. but, for a given physical problem one c.s.c.o. may be more useful
than another. for instance a c.s.c.o. that contains physically distinguished observables (e.g., observables whose
eigenstates happen to appear predominantly in nature) is more useful for calculations in physics than the c.s.c.o.
whose eigenvectors are very dierent from physical eigenstates. two dierent c.s.c.o.s lead to dierent basis systems,
whose vectors can be expanded with respect to each other. but this expansion is usually very complicated and
intractable, for which reason the choice of the physically right c.s.c.o. is very important for each particular physical
problem. this is the reason for which the lorentz basis of the poincare group is pretty useless for physics, because
the casimir operators of so(3, 1) are not important observables as compared to the momentum. however, the two
c.s.c.o. (2.2) and (2.13) are not even dierent in an irreducible representation of p, since its operators dier only by a
factor of the operator m , which is an invariant. the basis systems (2.6) and (2.14) are therefore the same, i.e., their
values dier by a normalization-phase factor n (p, j3)

the poincare transformations (2.7) act on the basis vectors (2.16) in the following way

| p, j3 (m, j)i = | p, j3 (m, j)i n (p, j3).

u(a, i)| p, j3i = eim pa| p, j3i
u(l(p))| p = 0, j3i = | p, j3i .

(2.16)

(2.17a)
(2.17b)

the distinction between the basis vectors | p, i and | p, i becomes important if one does not have an unitary
irreducible representation of p but a representation with many dierent values for (m2, j), e.g., h = pm2,j h(m, j).
then one has besides the observables (2.1), additional observables x (generators of an intrinsic symmetry group or
a spectrum generating group) and an additional system of commuting observables :

b = b1, b2, , bn

4

(2.18)

whose eigenvalues, b = (b1, b2, , bn ), characterize the elementary particles described by h(m, j) = hb(m, j) 3. in
order that (2.2) and (2.18) combine into a c.s.c.o., the operators b have to commute with m 2, p, w and s3. if also
the other observables x, which change the particle species number b, commute with m 2, p, w and s3, then the
combination of (2.2) and (2.18) gives a useful c.s.c.o. however, if the x do not commute with m 2 (i.e., the particle
species number changing operators x transform also from one mass eigenstate to another mass eigenstate changing
also the mass mb into mb) then the x will also not commute with p, [x, p] 6= 0. in this case, it may still happen
[6] that a velocity superselection rule holds :

then combination of (2.18) with (2.13), i.e., the

hx, pi = 0 (or at least hx, pi  0) .

pi, w3, w , m 2, b1, , bn

(2.19)

(2.20)

will form a useful c.s.c.o., but the combination of (2.2) with (2.18) will not. the generalized eigenvectors of (2.20),

| p, , b, m, ji, will then be a much more useful basis system for every     h = phb(m, j) than the corresponding

momentum eigenvectors. using the eigenvectors of (2.20), we have the dirac basis vector expansion :

 = xm,bxj,

z d3 p
2 p0| p, , b, m, jihj, m, b, , p| i for every    .

(2.21)

the momentum eigenvectors |p, , b . . .i may either not exist (if [b, p] 6= 0), or if they do exist, they are not useful
because the x change the value of p, which then becomes a function of b, p = pb. as a consequence, quantities like
form factors depend upon b through p. in contrast, using the velocity eigenvectors | p, , b,i under the assumption
(2.19) will lead to form factors with universal (independent of b) dependence upon the four-velocity. this was the
original motivation for the introduction of the velocity-basis vectors | p, , b,i [6].
the subject of the present work is the description of relativistic decaying states by representations of the poincare
group, combining wigners idea [8] of the description of stable relativistic particles by an uir of p, with gamows
idea of describing decaying particles by eigenvectors with complex energy. therefore, we need in the rest frame basis
vectors with complex energy, i.e., the m (and the s = m2) in (2.6) or in (2.14) has to be continued to complex values
e.g., to s = (mr  i/2)2. this will result in a continuation of the momenta p to complex values as well and can
lead to an enormous complication of the poincare group representations (see e.g., [5]). we want to do this analytic
continuation in the invariant mass s such that the p are continued to complex values in such a way that the p = ps
remain real. then, we obtain a smaller class of complex mass representations of p which are as similar in property
as possible to wigners uir (m, j). these are the minimally complex-mass representations which we shall denote by
(s, j).

for this minimal analytic continuation to be possible, it must be compatible with the boost (2.7d) and (2.17b).
the crucial observation is that the boosts l(p) are in fact, according to (2.4) only functions of p = ps ; l(p) = l(p).
as a consequence, the operators representing the boost u(l(p)) = u(l(p)) are functions of the real parameters p and
not of complex parameters p. this means they are the same operator functions in all the subspaces of the direct sum
pmb,j h(mb, j) and of the continuous direct sum

of the irreducible representations

h(s, j),

s = pp = e  p2 .

(2.23)

if we consider in (2.22) only (continuous) direct sums with the same value for j = jr then u() for any lorentz
transformation  is, according to (2.7c), the same operator function of the 6 parameters which are given by the three
pm or the three vm :

3the quantum numbers b are called the particle species numbers in [7].

(2.24)

and the three rotation angles (e.g., euler angles in the rest frame). the analytic continuation in s can therefore be
accomplished without aecting the lorentz transformations. the lorentz transformations in the minimally-complex
mass representation are represented unitarily by the same operators u() as in wigners uir (m, jr). at rest, on
|0, j3 (s, jr)i, only the time translations of p will be represented non-unitarily for complex values of s. and using
(2.17b) only the label s in the velocity basis | p, j3 (s, jr)i is complex. the basis vector decomposition (2.21) using the
velocity basis,

 = xj3

z d(s)z d( p)| p, j3(s, j)ih(s, j)j3, p| i

for     h(s, j) ,

(2.25)

is therefore more suitable than (2.8) that uses the momentum basis, because p is independent of s while p = s p is
not. if we deform the contour of integration for s from the real axis as in (2.22) into the complex s-plane then the
integral over d( p) in (2.25) remains unaected.

iii. relativistic kinematics for (two-particle) resonance scattering

continuous direct sums like (2.22) appear in the case of scattering experiments of two relativistic particles like e.g.,

the process

or the more theoretical process

e+ e  0  +  ,

+   0  +  .

(3.1a)

(3.1b)

these processes predominantly happen in the jp = 1 partial amplitude if the -meson mass region is selected for
the invariant mass square

s = (p1 + p2)2 = e2

 + p2

 , e = e1 + e2 , p = p1 + p2 ,

(3.2)

where p1 and p2 are the momenta of the two pions +, 4. the relativistic one particle states are given by an
irreducible representation space hni(mi, si) of the poincare group p. the independent, interaction-free two-particle
states (or n particle states) like the +  system in (3.1b) are given by the direct product of the irreducible
representation spaces h(m1, s1) and h(m2, s2) : hn1 (m1, s1)  hn2(m2, s2)  h. empirical evidence suggests that
the resonances in processes like (3.1) appear in one partial amplitude with a given value of resonance spin jr (e.g.,
 = 1). therefore, the rst problem is the reduction of the direct product h(m1, s1) h(m2, s2) into a direct sum
jp
of hn(s, j); the second problem is how to go from the free two-particle system to the interacting two-particle system.
the rst problem has been solved in general [24]

h  hn1 (m1, s1)  hn2 (m2, s2) = z 

(m1+m2)2

d(s)xnsl xj

hnsl(s, j) .

(3.3)

the sums in (3.3) extend over

j =

1

0

1/2 3/2 . . .

if s1 + s2 = integer
if s1 + s2 = half integer

,

4 though our discussions apply with obvious modications to the general case of

1 + 2 + 3 +   ri  1

+ 2

+ 3

+  







these generalizations lead to enormously more complicated equations. for the sake of simplicity, we shall therefore consider a
resonance scattering process like (3.1).

6

and the degeneracy indices (l, s) for a given j are summed over

s = s1 + s2 , s1 + s2  1 , . . .|s1  s2|
l = j + s , j + s  1 , j + s  2 , . . . j  s .

here j represents the total angular momentum of the combined + system; one of these values will be the resonance
spin jr. the degeneracy indices (s, l) for each xed value of j are the total spin angular momentum and the total
orbital angular momentum of the two , respectively. the quantum number n is summed over all channel numbers
that can be obtained by combining the species numbers n1 and n2 of the two .

instead of the invariant mass square s = p p = e2  p2 that we have used in (3.3) one often uses w = s, the

invariant mass or the energy in the center of mass system of the two particles n1, n2 [24]. the choice of the measure

d(s) = (s)ds,

(or if one uses w, of d(w) = (w)dw)

depends upon the normalization of the system of generalized basis vectors of (3.3). we shall use

(s) = 1, and then (w) = 2w

(3.3a)

(3.3b)

if we label the basis by w so that we do not change the normalization of the kets. the resonance space will be related
(but will not be identical) to a subspace of (3.3) with a denite value of angular momentum j (e.g., j = jp
3 = 1
in case of the -resonance of (3.1)). this is based on empirical evidence; resonances appear in one particular partial
amplitude with a particular value of resonance spin j = jr (though it may happen that there are more than one
resonance in the same partial amplitude, but at dierent resonance energy sr1 , sr2 , ). we will therefore single out
a particular subspace

hnls = z 

(m1+m2)2

ds  hnls(s, j)

(3.4)

with denite degeneracy or/and channel quantum numbers  = ls, n.

the reduction (3.3) is usually done using the wigner momentum kets (2.6) in which the clebsch-gordan coecients

are given by [24] :

h p1s13 p2s23 [m1s1, m2s2]| pj3 [wj],  i, where  now denotes  = n, l, s .

(3.5)

for the reasons mentioned above we want to work with the 4-velocity eigenkets |p, j3 [w, j],  i which are eigenvectors
of the operators

p = (p (1)

 + p (2)

 )(p (1) + p (2))

 + p (2)

 )m1, m 2 = (p (1)

with eigenvalues

p = (cid:18) e = p0

(3.6)

(3.7)

in here p (i)

clebsch-gordan coecients are the transition coecients hp1 p2 s13s23 [m1s1, m2s2]| pj3 [wj],  i between the direct

(3.8)

and the angular momentum basis |pj3 [wj],  i.
to obtain the clebsch-gordan coecients, one follows the same procedure as given in the classic papers [24] for
the clebsch-gordan coecients (3.5). this will be done in the appendix, where the general case will be discussed.
here we shall restrict ourselves to the special case s1 = 0, s2 = 0 to avoid the inessential complications due to the
so(3) clebsch-gordan coecients for the angular momentum couplings s1  s2  s, s  l  j and the occurrence of
the wigner rotations r(l1(p), pi) of the inverse boost l1(p) which will enter in (3.5). also for the process (3.1b)
this is sucient, since s+ = s = 0. there is no degeneracy of the angular momentum basis vectors in this case
and |pj3 [wj]i is given in terms of (3.8) by

(3.9)

the choice of the measure

is the same as (2.15a).

from the 4-translation invariance (conservation of 4-momentum) it follows that the clebsch-gordan is of the form

h p1 p2 | pj3 [wj]i = 4(p  r)hh p1 p2 | pj3 [wj]ii , where r  p1 + p2 .

the reduced matrix element in the center-of-mass is in analogy to the non-relativistic case given by [11]

hh pcm

| 0j3 [wj]ii = yjj3 (e)j(w, m1, m2) ,

(3.10)

(3.11)

where j(w, m1, m2) is a function of w (or s) which depends upon our choice of normalization for the basis vectors
|pj3 [wj]i in (3.9). the equations (3.10) and (3.11) are combined into

h p1 p2 | pj3 [wj]i = 2 e( p)3(p  r)(w  )yjj3 (e)j (w, m1, m2)

with 2 = r2 = (p1 + p2)2 ,

(3.12)

where again j(w, m1, m2) is a function that xes the -function normalization of |pj3 [wj]i. the unit vector e in
(3.11) is chosen to be in the c.m. frame the direction of pcm
2 . in general it is obtained from the relative
4-momentum q of michel and wightman [2] by ei = l1(p). 
i q. the j(w, m1, m2) and j(w, m1, m2) are some
weight functions which are determined from the required normalization of the 4-velocity kets (3.9). since for a
xed value of [wj] these generalized eigenvectors are the basis of the irreducible representation space h(w, j) of the
poincare group, we want them to be normalized like (2.15b), which in (3.9) has been already assured by the choice of
the invariant measure d3 pi

2w (w  w) in (3.13) is a consequence of the choice (3.4) for the measure.
after we have chosen the normalization as in (3.13), one determines the weight function j(w, m1, m2) using (3.9).
the result is :

|j(w, m1, m2)|2 =

where  is dened by [2]:

2m2

2w2

1m2
p(1, ( m1
w )2, ( m2

w )2)

,

(3.14)

(a, b, c) = a2 + b2 + c2  2(ab + bc + ac) .

except for the normalization factor , which follows from our chosen normalization (3.13), the values of the clebsch-
gordan coecients (3.12) is quite obvious 5. it expresses momentum conservation and the only factor that one may
be puzzled about is that it should be consistent with the 4-velocity normalization expressed by the 3( p  p), p = p
w
in (3.13). therewith, we have obtained by (3.9) with (3.8) and (3.12) a system of basis vectors for the space (3.3)
(with s1 = s2 = 0) which is the representation space of scattering processes like (3.1b). as expected, the basis vectors
are outside the hilbert space; | pj3 [wj]i    h  . they have denite values of angular momentum j and
invariant mass w  s 6; we shall dene the gamow vectors (describing 0) in terms of linear combinations of these

5 a formula like (3.12) is also given and explained in section 3.7 of [7] which for s = 0, s1 = s2 = 0 agrees with (3.12) except
for the normalization factor (3.14). for s 6= 0, si 6= 0, see appendix.
6 written in terms of hilbert spaces, d(s) means lebesgue integrations. however, within the rhs mathematics, one can
choose for h  | pj3 [wj] i a smooth function and use riemann integration and assign to each vector a well dened value w (not
just up to a set of measure zero)

c.m.-energy eigenvectors with a denite value of j. however, since the resonances form and decay under the inuence
of an interaction and the |pj3 [wj]i are interaction-free eigenvectors of the free-particle hamiltonian

k = p 0

1 + p 0
2

(3.15)

we have to go from the free-particle basis vectors (3.9) to the interaction-basis vectors. this can be done in analogy
to the non-relativistic case and may be justied in two ways :
1) one assumes that the time translation generator for the interaction system has two terms ( [7] ch.3), h0 and the
interaction v

h = h0 + v

in such a way that to each eigenvector of h0 with eigenvalue e = wp1 + p2,

h0 | pj3 [wj]i = e | pj3 [wj]i ,

there correspond eigenvectors of h with the same eigenvalue

h|pj3 [wj] int i = e | pj3 [wj] int i .

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

since vectors are not completely dened by the requirement that they be eigenvectors of an operator with a given
eigenvalue (but may dier by a phase factor (phase shifts) or unitary transformation (s-matrix) in case of degeneracy)
we have added the additional label int. this additional specication of the eigenvectors can be chosen in a variety
of ways that are connected with the spaces  that one admits, i.e., with initial and nal boundary conditions (as
explained for the non-relativistic case in [11]). since (3.16) may be a questionable hypothesis in relativistic physics a
second justication does not make use of the existence of the hamiltonian splitting (3.16).
2) one assumes the existence of an s-operator and of mller operators + and . + transforms non-interacting
states in which are prepared by an apparatus far away from the interaction region into exact state vectors +,

(3.19)
which evolve with the exact time-evolution operator h.  transforms observables |outihout| registered by the
detector placed far away from the interaction region into the vectors  which evolve with the exact h in the
interaction region :

+in = + , +(t) = eiht+ ,

out =  , (t) = eiht+ ,

(3.20)

where t is the time in the c.m. frame. the basis vectors for the free-particle space and the interaction-basis vectors
are then assumed to be related by 7

if (3.16) also holds then the symbol  at the center-of-mass is given by the solution of the lippmann-schwinger
equation

| pj3 [wj] i = | pj3 [wj]i .

(3.21)

|0j3 [wj] i = (cid:18)1 +

v(cid:19)|0j3 [wj]i .

(3.22)

1

w  h  i

the vectors |pj3 [wj] i are obtained from the basis vectors at rest |0j3 [wj] i by the boost (rotation-free lorentz
transformation) u(l(p)) whose parameters are the pm and whose generators are the interaction-incorporating observ-
ables

p0 = h, p m,

j ,

(3.23)

i.e., the exact generators of the poincare group ( [7] section 3.3). these vectors (3.22), which for a xed value of
[wj] span an irreducible representation space of the poincare group with the exact generators, will be used for the
denition of the relativistic gamow vectors. the values of j and s = w2 are j = integer (for s1 = s2 = 0 otherwise
also half integer) and (m1 + m2)2  s < . the value of j will be xed and represents the resonance spin; the same
we do with parity and the degeneracy quantum numbers (n, ). the values of s we shall continue from the physical
values into the complex plane of the relativistic s-matrix.

7in non-relativistic scattering o a xed target one assumes that the |p+i related by (3.21) to the |pi are not eigenvectors of
p since [v, pi] 6= 0.

appendix: reduction of the direct product of two one-particle uir of p 8

we discuss here the reduction of the direct product of two one-particle irreducible representation spaces of the
poincare group [m1, s1]  [m2, s2] into a continuous direct sum of irreducible representation (irrep) spaces [s, j] of
invariant mass squared s and spin j. this has been done in [24] using the wigner basis systems of momentum
eigenvectors. here we shall do it using the 4-velocity basis vectors of the poincare group p and obtain the clebsch-
gordan coecients of p for the velocity basis. for the one particle spaces, we choose the c.s.c.o. (2.13) with the
generalized eigenvectors (2.14). thus, the one particle spaces h(m, j) are labeled by the mass m and the spin j of
the particle. in analogy to the case of one-particle, a two-particle irrep space is labeled by the square of the total
invariant mass s = (p1 + p2)2 and the total angular momentum j of the two particles. the two-particle irrep space is
denoted by h
n(s, j), where  is a degeneracy label and n is a particle species label. thus the reduction problem is
written as

h(m1, s1)  h(m2, s2) = xj

z 
(m1+m2)2 h

n(s, j)ds .

(a1)

as in (2.14), the two-particle basis vectors of h
n(s, j) have as the only continuous variables the total four velocity of
the two particles and the square of the total invariant mass of the two particles. these basis vectors are denoted by :

with the normalization :

|p[sj], ni

h p[sj], n | p[sj], ni = 2p0 nnjj    3( p  p)(s  s) ,

(a2)

(a3)

where  is the three-component of the total angular momentum j. we denote the basis vectors of h(m1, s1)h(m2, s2)
by :

| p11[m1s1]i  | p22[m2s2]i  | p11[m1s1], p22[m2s2]i ,

(a4)

where 1 , 2 are the three-components of the spins s1 , s2 respectively. in order to obtain the clebsch-gordan coe-
cients,

h p11[m1s1], p22[m2s2]| p[sj], ni ,

(a5)

of the reduction (a1), we start by relabeling the basis vectors in (a4) by using s, p and the unit vector n = p1p2
as
|p1p2|
continuous parameters (we note that both sets, {p1, p2} and {p, n, s} consist of six independent parameters). thus,
we can write :

| p11[m1s1], p22[m2s2]i  | p n s, 1[m1s1]2[m2s2]i .

(a6)

in the rest frame of both particles, i.e., for p = pr =

angular momentum basis vectors :





1
0
0
0





, we can expand the unit vector n in terms of orbital

8the discussion here follows the one in [4] with the dierence that here the two particle irreducible representation spaces are
labeled by the square of the total invariant mass s instead of w = s; and the velocity basis are used instead of the momentum
basis.

|ni = xll3

|ll3ihll3|ni = xll3

|ll3iy ll3 (n) .

(a7)

we can further use the angular momentum clebsch-gordan coecients to combine the two spins, s1 and s2, to give a
total spin s with three component , which in turn is added to the orbital angular momentum l with three component
l3 to form a total angular momentum j with three component . this gives the basis vector for the two-particle irrep
space

thus, the degeneracy label  in (a2) designates the total spin s and the total orbital angular momentum l of both
particles; and the masses m1, m2 and spins s1, s2 of both particles are included in the particle species label n. thus,
(a1) can be rewritten in more details as :

| p[sj]ls; m1s1, m2s2i .

(a8)

h(m1, s1)  h(m2, s2) = xjls

z 
(m1+m2)2 hls

n (s, j)ds ,

where

s = |s1  s2|, |s1  s2| + 1,  , s1 + s2
j = |l  s|, |l  s| + 1,  , l + s .

with (a6) and (a7), we deduce that in the rest frame, the clebsch-gordan coecients of (a9) are given by :
h p11[m1s1], p22[m2s2], n| pr[sj], , n i = 2nn(s)nn (s  (m1 + m2)2)3(p1 + p2)(s  (p1 + p2)2)

(a9)

(a10)

where nn(s) is a normalization factor. having obtained the clebsch-gordan coecients in the rest frame (a10), we
can use the boost operator (2.17b) to obtain the clebsch-gordan coecients in a general frame 9:
h p11[m1s1], p22[m2s2], n| p[sj], n i = h p11[m1s1], p22[m2s2], n|u(l(p))| pr[sj], n i

where r(, p) is the wigner rotation given in (2.7c) and

the normalization factor nn(s) depends upon our normalization choice (a3). before discussing how to obtain it, let
us rst introduce the following notations :

e =


l1(p)(p1  p2)

matrices factors that appear in the clebsch-gordan coecients away from the rest frame, as exhibited in (a11).

11

in order to obtain the normalization factor nn(s), we insert a complete set of basis vectors (a4)
h p[sj], n | p[sj], ni and use (a13). upon doing so, we obtain :

[6] the use of velocity eigenvectors has been suggested as early as 1965 by j. werle, on a symmetry scheme described by
non-lie algebra, icpt preprint, trieste, 1965, unpublished. it has been incorporated in the spectrum-generating group
approach for the mass and spin spectrum, a. bohm, phys. rev. 175, 1767 (1968). it has been used to relate the form
factors for dierent decays to universal form factors for an su (3) multiplet in a. bohm, phys. rev. d 13, 2110 (1976),
and a. bohm, j. werle, nucl. phys. b 106, 165 (1976). as dynamical stability group of p/m  the same idea has been
suggested by h. van dam and l. c. biedenharn, phys. rev. d 14, 405, (1976). velocity eigenvectors were reintroduced
around 1990 as states of the heavy quark eective theory, again to reduce the number of independent form factors:
a. f. falk, h. georgi, b. grinstein, m. b. wise, nucl. phys. b 343, 1 (1990), h. georgi proceedings of the theoretical
advanced study institute, eds. r. k. ellis et al. (world scientic, 1992) and reference thereof. in this approach one often
gets the impression that the use of velocity basis vectors leads to approximate results. this, however is not the case if
one takes into consideration that velocity eigenkets do not represent physical states, but that physical state vectors are

13

obtained from the kets as continuous superpositions using the right measure in the integration. if this is done, the values
of observable quantities do not depend upon whether one uses the velocity basis or the momentum basis, only that the use
of the velocity basis often provides a more practical means of computation, by leading to form factors that do not depend
upon the mass.
