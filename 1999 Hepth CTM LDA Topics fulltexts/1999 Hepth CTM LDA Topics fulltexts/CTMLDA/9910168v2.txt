abstract. we discuss the possibility to construct an eective quantum eld theory for an
axial vector coupled to a dirac spinor eld. a massive axial vector describes antisymmetric
torsion. the consistency conditions include unitarity and renormalizability in the low-energy
region. the investigation of the ward identities and the one- and two-loop divergences
indicate serious problems arising in the theory. the nal conclusion is that torsion may
exist as a string excitation, but there are very severe restrictions for the existence of a
propagating torsion eld, subject to the quantization procedure, at low energies.

introduction

with respect to the space-time symmetries, the standard model of the elementary par-
ticle physics includes three types of elds: spinors, vectors and scalars. the same concerns
grand unied theories, which are indeed based on larger symmetry groups. the eective
interactions of qcd lead to the pion eld, which is a pseudo-scalar. one might, naturally,
ask whether there may be other elds or interactions which can be unobservable at low ener-
gies. this question becomes particularly important in view of the fact that the (super)string
theories yield, in their low-energy spectrum, some elds dierent from the ones mentioned
above. most of these elds are not propagating (and, consequently, are not visible) at avail-
able energies, because they have too huge masses (typically of the planck order). this
concerns, at rst, the higher-spin excitations related to the massive string modes. besides,
in addition to the usual elds, the massless excitations of the string spectrum contain a
skew-symmetric tensor, which eventually produces, in the low-energy eective string action,
the 3-form associated to torsion. in known string theories, this tensor shows up at rst order
in  and has a mass of the planck order. therefore, it doesnt propagate at low energies.
however, it is interesting to investigate the possibility that this eld possesses an essentially
smaller (or zero) mass, so that torsion could propagate. this implies the low theoretical
bound for the torsion mass.

here, we take the viewpoint according to which any propagating eld must be quantized,
so that the classical theory is nothing but an approximation for the complete theory including
quantum corrections. then, the appropriate framework for the investigation of a propagating
torsion is the eective quantum eld theory approach (see, for example, [1]). from the
modern point of view, most of the existing quantum eld theories should be regarded as
eective ones, descending from some other more fundamental theories. the classical action
of the eective theories may have the form of an innite series whose expansion is performed
in the inverse of some large massive parameter. at low energies, only the rst terms of the
expansion are relevant, so that one can consequently disregard high-derivative terms, though
some consistency conditions should be indeed satised. in particular, the theory must be
unitary and renormalizable in the given low-energy region. for the case of torsion, these
consistency conditions have been applied in [2]. it was shown that the theory possesses an
extra, softly broken, gauge symmetry and that this symmetry xes, in a unique way, the form
of the low-energy classical action. this action succeeds in the test based on the calculation
of the fermion determinant [2] and led to a wide set of phenomenological consequences.

the purpose of the present paper is to proceed further with the study of the possibility to
construct a quantum eld theory for a fermion-torsion system. in [2], the unique candidate
to be torsion action was suggested and some of its theoretical and phenomenological aspects
were discussed. it is well known that the theory of axial vector eld may have problems, and
these problems are usually accociated to the axial anomaly. however, in the case of torsion
embedding into the standard model, the anomaly can not appear due to the algebraic reasons
[2], because all the vector ingredients of the sm have group index which is absent for torsion.
however, as the example of the scalar-fermion-torsion shows, the absense of anomaly does not
guarantee consistency, and in particular the conict between renormalizability and unitarity
takes place. here we are going to investigate whether the ward-takahashi identities and the
one- and two-loop divergences arising in the fermion-torsion system are consistent with the
requirements an eective quantum eld theory should fulll. this study is necessary for the
nal answer of whether the space-time torsion can exist as an independent eld, propagating

2

at low energies, which is subject of quantization.

our paper is organized as follows: in section 2, a brief review of the previous results is
given and the main purpose of the subsequent study is formulated. next, in section 3, we
discuss in more details the symmetries of the theory, the analogue of boulware transformation
[3] and the ward identities corresponding to the softly broken symmetry associated to torsion.
for pedagogical purposes, we simultaneously state similar considerations for the vector eld.
section 4 is devoted to the calculation of the 1-loop divergences, with many technicalities
and the calculations for three simpler models are postponed to the appendix a. these
calculations include the one for the massive vector coupled to fermions. in order to perform
calculations for the cases of the massive vector and massive axial vector, we apply the
generalized schwinger-dewitt technique, developed in [4], which we supplement by some
technical tricks. the validity of the calculational method is veried in two massless cases,
for which the result may be achieved through the faddeev-popov method. section 5 contains
further analysis of the 1-loop renormalization and renormalization group equations. section
6 is devoted to the evaluation of the leading two-loop divergences. we apply, in this section,
the expansion of the loop integrals suggested in [2]. since the results of these two-loop
calculations have great importance for the qualitative output of our study, they are checked
in appendix b by using the standard feynman parameter method. finally, in section 6, we
draw our conclusions.

2. dynamical torsion: review of previous results

in this section, we briey present previous results. we start o by the background notions
for the gravity with torsion and quantum theory of matter elds in an external torsion eld.
a pedagogical introduction may be found in [5].

in the space - time with independent metric and torsion, the ane connection 

 is non-
 = 
symmetric, and the torsion tensor is dened as t 
. the covariant derivative,
, is based on the non-symmetric connection 
, while the notation  is kept for the
riemannian covariant derivative. from the metricity condition, g = 0 , the solution
for the connection can be easily found. it proves useful to divide the torsion eld into three
irreducible components:

  

t =

1
3

(t g  t g) 

1
6

s + q,

(1)

where the last tensor satises the conditions q

 = 0

and

q = 0.

let us now consider the interaction of torsion with matter elds. the interaction between
a dirac eld, , and an external gravitational eld with torsion is described by the action:

s1/2 = i z d4x  [  (   i q v + i  5 s )  im ]  ,

(2)

where  is an arbitrary parameter, which equals 1/8 for the special case of minimal coupling.
for our purposes, it is useful to keep  arbitrary. we have included the abelian vector eld,
v , for the sake of further convenience.

the study of the renormalization of gauge models in an external gravitational eld with
torsion has been carried out in [6]. in the general case, the theory includes gauge as well
as scalar and fermion elds linked by corresponding interactions (typical examples are the
standard model or guts), the non-minimal interaction with torsion proved necessary not

3

only for the spinor, but also for scalar elds. in the last case, the essential (necessary for the
renormalizability) interactions are described by the action:

ssc = z d4x (cid:26) 1

2

g   +

1
2

m2 2 +

1
2

 ss 2 +

1
2

1 r 2(cid:27) .

(3)

here, , 1 are non-minimal parameters. on has to notice that only the interactions with
the axial vector, s , are important in both cases (2) and (3). the interaction of scalars with
q
 and both spinors and scalars with t may be introduced, but it is purely non-minimal.
in the sequel, we consider only the axial part, s, of the torsion tensor. also, since metric
and torsion are independent elds, and we are especially interested in the torsion eects, in
what follows we consider the at metric only.

the problem of the action for the dynamical torsion eld is crucially important for all
investigations of the gravity with torsion. in the literature, one can meet several dierent
approaches for the construction of a torsion action [7, 8, 9, 10, 2]. in particular, [7] started
from the gauge principle for gravity (similar ideas are very popular; see [11, 12] for a com-
prehensive review). in [8, 9], the family of the high-derivative metric-torsion actions, leading
to theories without unphysical massive spin-2 ghosts has been constructed. therefore, in
these works, the guiding principle was the unitarity of the theory. in the analysis of the
physical signicance of torsion, its most important part is the axial component, s , for it
is the component which couples to the fermions. in [10], it was readily noticed that for the
study of the possible torsion eects at low energies, only the second-derivative terms are
indeed relevant. furthermore, in [10], it was established that, as usual for the vector eld,
the propagation of both the transverse and the longitudinal parts of the axial vector s un-
avoidably breaks unitarity (see, for example, [13]). after that, in [10], only the longitudinal
part of s has been considered, and torsion was thereby reduced to its pseudoscalar piece.
in [2], the problem of consistency had been formulated in a closed form, taking both aspects
of eective eld theory into account. the choice of the action for the dynamical torsion
eld should be made in such a way that it leads to a unitary and renormalizable eective
quantum eld theory.

let us see how this principle can be applied to the fermion-torsion interaction. starting

from (2), we may notice that this action possesses two symmetries: the usual gauge one,

 =  ei(x),

 =  ei(x),

v 
 = v + q1 (x),

and an additional symmetry which is softly broken by the spinor mass [2, 14]:

 = ei5(x) ,

 =  ei5(x),

s
 = s  1 (x) .

(4)

(5)

in fact, the last symmetry is the key point allowing to set up a unique form of the torsion
action. even softly broken, this symmetry yields the appearance of the transverse second-
derivative counterterm s2
 and (exactly because it is softly broken) the massive counterterm,
both coming, for instance, from a single fermion loop (see, for example, our calculations in
the next section). thus, if we wish to have a renormalizable eective eld theory for the
torsion, these two terms must be included into the action for a dynamical torsion. on the
other hand, the condition of unitarity forbids the third possible structure 4, (s)2 .

4all other possible terms exhibit higher derivatives or they are non-local.

4

therefore, the only chance to meet the conditions for the low-energy renormalizability

and unitarity is to choose the expression

storf er = z d4x (cid:26) 

1
4

ss +

1
2

m 2 ss + i  [  ( + i  5 s)  im ] (cid:27)

(6)

as the torsion-fermion action.

expression (6) shall be the main object of study in the present paper. however, it is very
instructive for us to see, how the introduction of the scalar elds explicitly breaks the above
scheme. one can consult the second work of ref.
[2] for a complete consideration. when
one implements scalars, the yukawa interaction produces a rigid breaking of the symmetry
(5). this happens because the yukawa coupling is massless. as a result of this breaking,
there are no restrictions on the divergences coming from the diagrams including the yukawa
vertex. as it was proved in [2], these diagrams really require the longitudinal counterterm
(s)2 at the two-loop level. of course, in order to have a renormalizable theory, the
term (s)2 might be introduced into the torsion action but, as it was already mentioned,
this immediately breaks unitarity. therefore, in the torsion-fermion-scalar theory, there is a
manifest conict between renormalizability and unitarity. this conict resembles the similar
one which takes place in high-derivative gravity [15, 5]. the dierence is that, for gravity,
there is a massless mode which provides classical eects through the propagation of graviton,
while for the torsion there are no massless modes, and if the lightest torsion mode has a mass
of the planck order, then an independent torsion eld simply does not exist.

one can imagine several possibilities to overcome the crisis between renormalizability and
unitarity, as described above. for instance, it is possible to search for an extra symmetry
providing the cancellation of the longitudinal divergences. another option is to restrict our
considerations to theories without fundamental scalars, such as technicolour or the nambu-
jona-lasinho models. in view of this, it becomes especially important to investigate whether
the fermion-torsion system satises the consistency conditions. in the present paper, we are
going to make a complete study of the conditions of renormalizability and unitarity for the
fermion-torsion system without scalar elds.

in the next sections, we shall show that, unfortunately, despite the breaking of the
symmetry (5) is soft, the nal situation is very similar to the one with the scalar elds. one
may maintain the unitarity of the renormalized theory, but only at the expenses of a very
rigid limit on the torsion mass, which must be much larger than the one of the fermions and
much lighter than the fundamental scale.

3. boulwares parametrization and the ward identities

we need to perform an analogue of boulware transformation [3] in the fermion - axial
vector system. for pedagogical reasons, we rst consider the usual vector case, that is,
repeat the transformation of [3]. the action, in original variables, has the form:

smvec = z d4x (cid:26) 

1
4

vv  +

1
2

m 2 vv  + i  [  (  i g v)  im ] (cid:27) ,

(7)

and, after the change of the eld variables [3]:

 = exp(cid:26) ig

m

 (cid:27)   ,

 =   exp(cid:26)

ig
m

 (cid:27) ,

v = v 

 

1
m

 ,

(8)

5

the new scalar, , is completely factored out:

smvec = z d4x (cid:26) 

1

(cid:17)2
4 (cid:16)v 

+

1
2

m 2 v 

 v  +

1
2

 + i  [ ( + i g v 

 )] (cid:27) .

(9)

let us now consider the fermion-torsion system given by the action (6). the change of

variables, similar to the one in (8), has the form:

 = exp(cid:26) i

m

5 (cid:27)  ,

 =  exp(cid:26) i

m

5 (cid:27) ,

s = s

 

1
m

 ,

(10)

 and sk

where s
 =  are the transverse and longitudinal parts of the axial vector
respectively, the latter being equivalent to the pseudoscalar . one has to notice that,
contrary to (8), but in full accordance with (5), the signs of both the exponents in (10) are
the same. in terms of the new variables, the action becomes

storf er = z d4x (cid:26) 

1
4

s
s +

1
2

m 2 s

 s+

+i  [  ( + i  5 s

 )  im  e

2i

m  5 ]  +

1
2

(cid:27) ,

(11)

  s

 = s

where s
 = s . the last expression can be more easily analyzed by
comparison with a similar parametrization for the massive abelian eld (8). contrary to
the last, for the torsion axial vector (11) the scalar mode does not decouple, but rather
couple with interactions as follows:
i) yukawa-type, resembling the problems with the ordinary scalar.
ii) exponential, which prevents the model from being power-counting renormalizable.

however, at rst sight, there is a hope that the above features would not be fatal for
the theory. with respect to the point (i), one can guess that the only result of the non-
factorization, which could be dangerous for the consistency of the eective quantum theory,
would be the propagation of the longitudinal mode of the torsion, and this does not directly
follow from the non-factorization of the scalar degree of freedom in the classical action.
on the other hand, (ii) indicates the non-renormalizability, which might mean just the
appearance of the higher-derivative divergences, that do not matter within the eective
approach. thus, a more detailed analysis is necessary. in particular, the one-loop calculation
in the theory (6) may be helpful, and it will be done in the next section.

let us consider, for a moment, the ward-takahashi identities for the two theories (7) and
(6.) in the case of the massive vector (7), the identity for the eective action, [v, , ] ,
(here v, ,  are mean, or background elds) has the form

i


v

+ ie  


 






!  im 2v = 0 .

(12)

applying the /v operator, and setting v, ,  = 0, we get the identities for the inverse
propagator



2

v(x)v(y)

= m 2(x  y) .

(13)

6

now, applying 2/(y) (z), one obtains



3

(y) (z)v(x)

= ie 

2

(y) (z)

(x  y) 

2

(y) (z)

(x  z)! .

(14)

similar relations take place for other vertices. the vector mass completely decouples and
shows up exclusively in the propagator. indeed, under these circumstances, it cannot aect
the divergences, except in some trivial way. the result is nothing but the direct conrmation
of the decoupling which is observed in boulware-like parametrization (9).

in our case of the massive axial vector eld (6), we have, by means of analogous proce-

dures,

 


s

 i  5


 






5! + 2im 5 + m 2s = 0 .

(15)

applying functional derivatives, the ward-takahashi identities for the inverse propagator
and the vertices take over the form:



2

s(x)s(y)

= m 2(x  y)

and



3

 (z)s(x)(y)

= 2im5(x  y)(x  z) +

+ i 

2

 (z)(y)

5(x  y) + (x  z)5

2

(y) (z)! ,

(16)

(17)

and so on. the last expressions manifest the clear dierence with respect to the previous
ones, (12)  (14). in the axial vector case, the massive term aects the interaction vertices,
and one can expect that some non-invariant divergences may show up.

4. one-loop calculation in the fermion-torsion case.

the purpose of this section is to derive the full set of 1-loop counterterms for the massive
axial vector coupled to the dirac spinor. to get them, we are going to apply the background
eld method together with the schwinger-dewitt expansion. however, since the use of these
methods for the system of interest is quite non-trivial, and also for pedagogical reasons, we
perform also three auxiliary calculations: for the massless vector coupled to a massive spinor
(qed), for the massless axial vector (this one coupled to massless spinors) and for the
massive vector, all using the same calculational scheme as for the case of the massive axial
vector. these additional calculations are collected in the appendix a. here, we present the
details of calculation for the massive axial vector.

let us start from the fermionic determinant, which was already considered by many au-
thors [16, 17, 18, 2]. the contribution from the single fermion loop is given by the expression

(1)
f ermion = i t r ln h ,

where

h = {id + m} .

(18)

here, d = +i5s is the covariant derivative. it proves useful to introduce the conjugate
derivative, d

 =   i5s. then, one can write

f ermion = 

i
2

t r ln h  h  = 

i
2

t r ln {dd  m2} =

7

= 

i
2

t r ln { (d

d + m2) } .

(19)

after a simple algebra, one can cast two useful forms for the operator between parenthesis:
the non-covariant:

 h  h  = 2 + r +  ,

with

r = 25s ,

 = i5(s) +

i
2

5s + 2ss + m2 ;

(20)

and covariant

 h  h  = d2 + ed + f,

with

e = 25s  2i5s ,

f = m2 +

i
2

5s .

(21)

(22)

both expressions are compatible with the use of the standard schwinger-dewitt technique
(covariant calculation is much shorter), which yields the well-known result

(1)
f ermion,div =

n4



z dnx ( 22

3

ss  8m22ss + 2m4) .

(23)

here,  = (4)2 (n  4) is the parameter of dimensional regularization.

now, we are in a position to start the complete calculation of divergences. the use of the
background eld method supposes the split (shift) of the eld variables into a background
and a quantum part. however, in the case of the (axial)vector-fermion system, the simple
shift of the elds leads to an enormous volume of calculations, even for a massive vector.
such a calculation becomes extremely dicult for the axial massive vector (6). that is why
we have invented a simple trick combining the background eld method with the boulware
transformation (10) for the quantum elds. as we shall see in a moment, our method makes
the calculations reasonably simpler.

let us divide the elds into background (s, , ) and quantum (t

 , , , ) parts, ac-

cording to what follows:

  
  



s  s





m 5  ( + ) ,

= ei 
= (  + )  ei 
m 5 ,
1
m

 = s + t

 

 .

the one-loop eective action depends on the quadratic (in quantum elds) part of the total
action:

s(2) =

1

2 z d4x (t

 ( 2 + m 2 )t +  (2)  + t

 ( 2 5 )  +  (

5)  +  (

m

5)  +  (2id + 2m )(cid:27) .

(24)

8

making the usual change of the fermionic variables 5,  =  i
  i, we arrive at the following expression:

2 (d+im) , and substituting

s(2) =

1

2 z d4x ( t

   )  h

where the hermitian bilinear form h has the form


(2 + m 2)

matrix operator (25) are dened according to (24). they include the expressions (20) and
also

(26)

the operator h given above might look like the minimal second order operator ( 2 +
2h + ); but, in fact, it is not minimal because of the projectors  in the axial vector-
axial vector t
 sector. that is why one cannot directly apply the standard schwinger-
dewitt expansion to derive the divergent contributions to the one-loop eective action, and
some more sophisticated technique is needed.

  t

let us perform the expansion in the transverse axial vector space, and then apply the
generalized schwinger-dewitt technique developed by barvinsky and vilkovisky [4]. to
some extent, the transformations which we are going to do are similar to the ones which
have been used for the calculations in high-derivative gravity coupled to matter [19] (see
also [5]). notice that, in the present case, these transformations enable one to perform the
calculations in the abelian vector theory. for the massless case, the results are indeed the
same as the ones derived with the use of the faddeev-popov method.

since we are dealing with the mixed operator including the boson and fermion sectors,
the trace of all products should be understood as a supertrace (str), which implies a positive
sign for the bosonic sector and negative sign for the fermionic sector. one can perform the
following expansion:

(1) =

str lnh =

.

(28)

5one has to remember that the jacobian of this change of variables has been already taken into account

before, and its divergences were counted in (23).

9

we are going to use the universal traces of [4], and since we are working in at space-time,
the only non-zero traces, for any given n, are

tr ( 1 ... 2n4

1
2n )|div = 

2i

 z d4x

g(n2)
1 ... 2n4

2n2(n  1)!

.

(29)

here, the standard notational conventions of [4] are used:

g(0) = 1 ,

g(2)
 = g ,

g(4)
 = gg + gg + gg ,

e.t.c. .

it is easy to see, by counting the number of derivative in the terms of the series (27), that the
divergences appear only for n = 2, 3, 4 and that the ones coming from n = 4 are completely
dened by the fermionic operator (18), which we have already taken into account. therefore,
now we only need to work with the terms with n = 2, 3.

consider the n = 2 term.

it is interesting to notice that the above expression (47) is not gauge invariant. it is not
dicult to see that the non-invariant terms come as a contribution of the scalar . this
indicates that, unlike the massive (abelian) vector eld (see appendix a), for the massive
axial vector the violation of the symmetry (5) is not soft. therefore, we have conrmed our
previous analysis based on the ward-takahashi identities. more detailed consideration of
the renormalization is presented in the next section.

5. renormalization and renormalization group

the expression (47) for the 1-loop divergences in the theory (6) has two non-invariant
pieces. the rst one comes from the d
 term, which is not invariant with respect to (5).
in fact, this divergence produces just a slight change in the renormalization of the coupling
constant , so that the softly broken symmetry (5) can be maintained at the quantum
level. the second term is essentially non-invariant ( )2-structure. the renormalizability
of the theory requires the ( )2 term to be introduced into the classical action, so that
the corresponding counterterm can be removed by means of the renormalization of the
corresponding parameter. indeed, one can calculate again the 1-loop divergences taking this
term into account. on the other hand, this is not necessary, because there is no one-loop
diagram containing this ( )2-vertex which could contribute to the dangerous longitudinal
divergence. 6 unfortunately, such a diagram exists at the two-loop level. we postpone the
analysis of the two-loop diagrams to the next section, and consider now, in some details, the
one-loop renormalization.

the appearance of the new ( )2-vertex shows that the fermion-torsion theory cannot
be consistent even as an eective quantum eld theory, at least without some additional
restrictions being imposed. let us try to introduce some additional restrictions on the value

6 let us remind the danger of the (s )2-type counterterm, which spoils both the renormalizability and

the unitarity of the theory.

of the torsion mass, m. suppose m  m. this means that the torsion mass is much (let us
say, some orders) larger than the mass of any fermion interacting with torsion. alternatively,
one can suppose that torsion interacts only with massless spinors (this case is free from any
problem at the quantum level, but the existence of the massless spinors in the sm is nowadays
problematic) or very light fermions and decouples, by denition, from heavy fermions. since
our simplied consideration does not distinguish heavy and light quarks, leptons etc, we just
accept m  m for a moment. then, both types of non-invariant counterterms carry very
small coecients, proportional to (m/m)2. suppose we include the dangerous interaction
( )2 into the action, but with a very small coupling of the order   m2/m 4. this relation
will not be violated by the renormalization group running of the coupling  , and hence the
renormalizability is achieved with a very weak coupling ( )2. as we shall see in the
next section, the two-loop contribution to the dangerous longitudinal counterterm (s)2
contains the ( )2-vertex. therefore, one nds it possible to preserve renormalizability if
the (s)2-term is included into the action (6) with a coecient b  (m/m)4.

formally, if the (s)2-structure is present, unitarity is broken, since the corresponding
degree of freedom is a ghost. this term, along with the canonical kinetic term ss, will un-
avoidably plague the spectrum with unphysical modes: either a tachyonic or a negative-norm
state (ghost) excitation will show up as a spin-1 or a scalar excitation. however, unitarity
is still ensured in the spinor sector of the theory; it may break only in the torsion  torsion
sector. let us consider some low-energy amplitude involving in-states of the propagating
transverse torsion. in order to generate out-states of the longitudinal torsion, one has to
consider the diagrams with corresponding vertices. such vertices are absent at tree-level,
and the ones, which involve a non-invariant (   )2-interaction show up, as we shall see in
the next section, at the second loop only. then, the longitudinal out-state is suppressed by
the coecient (m/m)4. therefore, in the low-energy amplitudes of the torsion (axial vector
s) scattering, the unitarity is maintained with the precision (m/m)4.

consider the one-loop renormalization and the corresponding renormalization group in
some details. the relations between bare and renormalized elds and the coupling  follow
from (47):

indeed, for the case m  m and in the low-energy region, this equation reduces to the
one presented in [2] (that is identical to the similar equation of qed). in any other case,

13

the theory of torsion coupled to the massive spinors is inconsistent, and equation (50) is
meaningless.

one can also write down the renormalization group equation for the parameter  dened

above. using (49), we arrive at the following equation:

(4)2 d
dt

= 8 4 .

(51)

this equation conrms the lack of a too fast running for this parameter. indeed, all the last
consideration is valid only under the assumption that m  m and has very restricted sense.

6. two-loop diagrams

let us investigate the 2-loop diagrams contributing to the propagator of the axial vector,
s. the question we intend to answer is whether there are longitudinal divergences at the
two-loop level. therefore, it is reasonable to start from the diagrams which can exhibit
1/2-divergences 7, and only if none of them are found, we explore the 1/ -pole, which is
always more complicated to calculate.

the leading 1/2-two-loop divergences of the mass operator for the axial vector s come
from two distinct types of diagrams: the ones with the ( )2 -vertex and the ones without
this vertex. as we shall ensure, the most dangerous diagrams are those with 4-fermion
interaction. as we have seen in the last two sections, this kind of interaction is a remarkable
feature of the axial vector theory, which is absent in a massive vector theory. now, we shall
calculate divergent 1/2 -contributions from two diagrams with the ( )2 -vertex, using the
expansion suggested in [2]; later on, in appendix b, this calculation will be checked using
feynman parameters.

consider rst the diagram of figure 1. this graph can be expressed, after making some

commutations of the -matrices, as

1

 = 2 tr {i  i} ,

(52)

where   m2

i(p) = z

following [2], we can perform the expansion

1

(p  q)2  m2 =

1

p2  m2

p2  m2 !n
(1)n  2p . q + q2

.



xn=0

(53)

(54)

now, as far as we are working within an eective eld theory framework, it is possible to
omit the powers of q higher than 2. these terms can give contributions to the divergences,
but only to the ones with higher derivatives, and they are, therefore, out of our interest.

when performing the integrations, we trace just the divergent parts, thus arriving (using

the integrals from [21]) at the expressions:

i =

i

 (cid:26)

1
6

q2  2m2 

1
6

qq + mq(cid:27) + ...,

(55)

7in this paper, we adopt the dimensional regularization. all necessary integrals may be found in [20, 21]

14

where the dots stand for the nite and higher-derivative divergent terms. substituting this
into (52), we obtain the leading divergence of the diagram of fig. 1:

1,div

 = 

2

2 (cid:26)+16m4 +

28
3

m2qq 

16
3

m2q2(cid:27) + ...

(56)

this result shows that the construction of the rst diagram contains an 1/2 -longitudinal
counterterm.

consider the second two-loop diagram depicted in fig. 2. its contribution to the polar-

ization operator, 2

 , is written, after certain transformations, in the following way:

2

 = 2 tr {i  j} ,

i = z

ddp
(2)d

p/  m
p2  m2 

p/  q/ + m
(p  q)2  m2 

p/  m
p2  m2

where

and

j = z

ddp
(2)d

k/  m
k2  m2 .

it proves useful to introduce the following -matrix denitions:

a =  ,

(57)

(58)

(59)

b = q  + m (    )

c = m2 (    ) + mq ( + ) .

d = m2q  + m3  .

then, the rst integral can be written as

i = z

ddp
(2)d

a  ppp + b  pp + cp + d

(p2  m2)2 ( (p  q)2  m2 )

.

(60)

using the expansion (54), and disregarding higher powers of q, as well as odd powers of p in
the numerator of the resulting integral, one obtains, after using standard results [21]:

i =

i

 (cid:26) 1

4

b

q(cid:27) + ...

the divergent contribution to j is

j =

m3 + ...

15

(61)

(62)

(63)

now, the calculation of (57) is straightforward:

 =

2
2 8m4 + ...

(64)

as we see, this diagram does not contribute to the kinetic counterterm (with accuracy of the
higher-derivative terms), and hence the cancellation of the contributions to the longitudinal
counterterm coming from 1
 do not take place. this result is reproduced in the appendix
b, with the help of the feynman parameters.

one has to notice that other two-loop diagrams do not include the ( )2 -vertex. thus,

even if those diagrams contribute to the longitudinal counterterm, the cancellation with 1

should require some special ne-tuning between  and  . in fact, one can prove, without
explicit calculation, that the remaining two-loop diagrams of figs. 3 and 4 do not contribute
to the longitudinal 1/2 -pole. in order to see this, let us notice that the leading (in our case
1/2 ) divergence may be obtained by consequent substitution of the contributions from the
subdiagrams by their local divergent components. since the local counterterms produced by
the subdiagrams of the two-loop graphs depicted in figs. 3 and 4 are minus the one-loop
expression (47), the corresponding divergent vertices are 1/ factor classical vertices. hence,
in the leading 1/2 -divergences of the diagrams of figs 3 and 4, one meets again the same
expressions as in (47). the result of our consideration is, therefore, the non-cancellation of
the 1/2 -longitudinal divergence (56). this means that the theory (6), without additional
restrictions on the torsion mass, like m  m , is inconsistent at the quantum level.

10. conclusions

we have investigated, in more details than in the previous works [2], the quantum eld
theory of the fermion-torsion system. the torsion is presented by its purely antisymmetric
part, equivalent to the axial vector s. it was shown that renormalizability and unitarity
may be achieved only in the case of massless spinors coupled to massless torsion, without
scalar elds. according to recent data on the neutrino oscillations, all existing fermions have
a non-zero mass. probably, this means that they also interact with the higgs scalar. thus,
it is clear that torsion cannot be implemented in a standard model scenario or, at least, into
its versions which are available to the date.

alternatively, one has to input very severe restrictions on the torsion mass, which has
to be much greater than the mass of the heaviest fermion (say, t-quark, with a mass of 175
gev ), and use an eective quantum eld theory approach, restricting considerations to the
low-energy amplitudes only. this approach implies the existence of a fundamental theory
which is valid at higher energies. the eective theory may be used only at the energies
essentially smaller than the typical mass scale of the fundamental theory. if the mass of
torsion is comparable to this fundamental scale, all the torsion degrees of freedom may be
described directly in the framework of the fundamental theory.

hence, in order to have propagating torsion, one has to satisfy a double inequality:

mf ermion  mtorsion  mf undamental .

(65)

usually, the fundamental scale is associated with the planck mass, mp l  1019 gev 8,
and therefore we still have a huge gap on the energy spectrum, which is not completely

8as a by product, our study shows that if the real fundamental scale is just a few orders above t ev ,
there is no room for an independent propagating torsion. thus, one cannot incorporate torsion into the
resent discussion of the t ev-gravity (see, for instance, [24]).

16

covered by the present theoretical consideration. of course, this gap cannot be closed by
any experiment, because the mass of torsion is too big. even the restrictions coming from
the contact experiments [2] achieve only the region m < 3 t ev , and that is not enough to
satisfy (65) for all the fermions of the standard model. it is clear that the existence of a
torsion-interacting fermions with mass of many orders larger than mt (like the ones which
are expected in many guts) can close the gap on the particle spectrum and forbid an
independent torsion.

the situation with torsion is similar to the one with quantum gravity. in both cases,
there is a conict between renormalizability (which lacks, in case of gravity, for the einstein
theory) and unitarity which is violated in high-derivative models [15, 22]. in some sense,
this analogy is natural, because both the metric and torsion represent the internal aspects
of the space-time manifold rather than usual elds. therefore, one of the options is to give
up the quantization of these two elds and consider them only as a classical background.
if one does not accept this option, it is possible to consider both the metric and torsion
as eective low-energy interactions resulting from a more fundamental theory like string.
both the metric and torsion result from string, but the crucial dierence is that metric has
massless degrees of freedom while torsion appears to have a mass in all known versions of
string theory [23]. it is interesting that the study of an eective quantum eld theory for the
metric does not meet major diculties [25, 1], while the consistency of the theory requires
a lower-bound (65) on the torsion mass. one can guess that this is more than an accidental
coincidence.

indeed, it is possible, that some new symmetries will be discovered, which make the
consistent quantum theory of the propagating torsion possible. however, in the framework
of the well-established results, the most natural supposition is perhaps that the torsion does
not exist as an independent eld, or that it is purely classical eld which should not be
quantized.

on the other hand, our study does not close the possibility of having composite torsion,
which can appear, for instance, as a vacuum condensate of the light (or maybe even massless)
spinor elds. this possibility deserves, from our point of view, special investigation.

the operator (a3) is simpler than the one in (25), because of the decoupling of the scalar
mode in the vector case.

now, we can evaluate the one-loop divergences of the eective action in the theory (7).

and, looking for logarithmic divergences, restrict our consideration to the terms with n =
2, 3, 4. also we notice that, as for the axial vector, n = 4 contributions are coming from the
fermion loop and can be easily derived by standard means [5]. the n = 2, 3 terms can be
worked out exactly like for the axial vector case, and the partial results for the divergences
read

in the cases of the massless vector coupled to spinor eld (qed), and the massless axial
vector coupled to massless spinor, the 1-loop calculation can be done in a standard manner
with the help of the faddeev-popov method. however, in order to check our calculational
method, we performed these calculations in the same way as for the massive cases. the most
of the intermediate calculations can be easily restored using the massive cases, so we shall
give just a main results.

for the fermion coupled to the massless vector (qed), the calculation is very simple and

the divergences have the well-known form:

div =

 z d4x ( 6e2m  +

consider, in some more details, the theory of the massless axial vector coupled to the

massless dirac spinor. the classical action is

s = z d4x (cid:26)

4

ss + i d(cid:27) ,

(a9)

where the covariant derivative is the same as for the massive case. this action is completely
invariant under the gauge transformation (5). performing the change of variables and apply-
ing the background eld method, as described in section 4, we can write the bilinear form
of the action in the form

h =   (2 + m 2) 

p

(l + m )

12 + r +  ! ,

(a10)

where

l = i 5 ,

m  = 2 s ,

p  = 25 .

the expansion for i

2 tr ln h and the remaining calculations will produce almost the same
intermediate formulas as for the fermion-massive vector calculation. the reason is that the
matrices h have many identical structures, the only dierence lying on the equations (a11)
above.

we have, after substituting (a11) into the previous general formulae, noticed that two

contributions cancel

it is indeed gauge invariant. the same divergence follows from the standard calculation
using the faddeev-popov method.

appendix b.
two-loop calculation using feynman parametrization

here, we start from the expression (53), performing in the denominator the feynman

parametrization:

1
ab

=

1

z0

dx

{ ax + (1  x)b }2

(b1)

following the standard procedures in dimensional regularization, we have to change the
integration variable as p  p = p  qx. after that, one meets some known integrals and
get

i =

where

()

(4)2 z 1

0

dx n  + d o ,

(b2)

 = q2x(1  x)  m2 ,

d =  qqx2 + xp (2m  + 2m   q) + mq   m2 .

(b3)

by direct computation of the above integral, one arrives exactly at the result found by
the previous method, eq. (55). indeed, the polarization operator calculated by these two
methods turn out to be the same, eq. (56).

now, we recalculate the diagram of the fig. 2. starting from (60), one has to perform

the feynman parametrization

1
ab2 =

1

z0

2(1  x) dx

(ax + (1  x)b)3 ,

(b4)

and the usual variable shift p = p  xq. after proper algebraic manipulations, one arrives at
the expression:

i = 2z 1

0

dx (1  x)z

ddp
(2)d

(a + a + a)xq + b

(p2  )3

pp.

(b5)

using known integrals in dimensional regularization, and performing the integration over x,
we obtain

i =

i

(q +q +q)+

(12m  4m +2q )+ ...; (b6)

and as we already have j, we arrive at a nal result identical to (64).
