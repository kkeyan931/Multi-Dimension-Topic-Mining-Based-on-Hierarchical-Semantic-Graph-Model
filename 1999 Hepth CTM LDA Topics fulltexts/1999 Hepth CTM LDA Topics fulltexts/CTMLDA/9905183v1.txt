abstract

the leading eikonal s-matrix for three graviton scattering in d = 11 supergravity
and matrix theory are shown to precisely agree. the result unies the source-probe
plus recoil approach of okawa and yoneya and relaxes the restriction imposed by those
authors that all d-particle impact parameters and velocities are mutually perpendicular.
furthermore, the unied s-matrix approach facilitates a clean-cut study of m-theoretic
r4 curvature corrections to the low energy supergravity eective action. in particular, the
leading r4 correction to the three graviton s-matrix is computed and compared to the
corresponding next to leading order two loop u(3) amplitude in matrix theory. we nd
a clear disagreement of the two resulting tensor structures.

1 introduction

according to current thinking, the various known string theories should be regarded as
appropriate limits of a more fundamental eleven dimensional theory, referred to as m-
theory [1]. the cornerstone of our present understanding of m-theory is that its low energy
eective action ought be d = 11 supergravity [2]. it has been proposed, however, that the
quantum degrees of freedom of light-cone m-theory are captured by a supersymmetric
quantum mechanical u(n) yangmills model, known as matrix theory [3, 4]. in practical
terms this has meant that a large body of research has been devoted to comparing quantities
computed via matrix theory with those in d = 11 supergravity. in particular, at the level
of comparing phase shifts for eikonal scattering of gravitons [5, 6, 7] along with the complete
tree level t-channel (2  2) graviton and antisymmetric tensor s-matrices [8, 9], impressive
agreement has been found. it has also been possible to successfully compare the conserved
currents of the two models [10].

nevertheless,

it should be noted that computations to date have only managed to
show the equivalence of one and two loop computations in a relatively simple quantum
mechanical model with what amounts to tree level supergravity. therefore, the capability
of the matrix theory to uncover genuinely new physics seems somewhat limited. this is
the main question we shall address in this paper, that is whether the model serves as a
tool to study quantum corrections to the supergravity action. to this end it is clearly of
central importance to determine the exact nature of the proposed correspondence.

the rst issue is to identify the correspondence between the states of the two theories.
indeed, one of the motivations for the original conjecture [3] was the realization that the
one-dimensional super yang-mills model possesses asymptotic excitations that behave as
supergravitons of eleven dimensional supergravity. this correspondence was rened in [11]
where explicit asymptotic wave functions of gravitons, antisymmetric tensors and gravitini
were found in the quantum mechanical model. following the lines of [11], it has been
possible to nd a formalism to compute eikonal scattering amplitudes for these excitations
in matrix theory [8, 9]. in this article we apply this method (which we often refer to as the
matrix theory lsz formalism) to multi-particle scattering. in particular, we consider three
graviton amplitudes (studied already extensively within an eikonal phase shift framework
by okawa and yoneya [7, 12]).

the motivations for this computation are twofold. firstly, given the agreement found
in [7] for this process, such a calculation provides both a detailed test of our approach and
at the same time veries their work. actually our formalism will provide not only a check
of the results of [7, 12], but also an extension and unication of them. in particular, we
have been able to drop the restriction made by [7] that all d-particle velocities and impact
parameters are mutually perpendicular. furthermore, in a direct comparison of scattering
amplitudes, there is no need to distinguish between recoil and non-recoil terms, as long as
one sums over all the feynman diagrams in the theory, including, in particular, the one
particle reducible graphs. our result constitutes the complete agreement of t-channel three
particle spin independent s-matrices in matrix theory and tree level supergravity.

the second motivation of our computation arises from the observation of [13] that the

1

next to leading term in the two loop eective action of matrix theory, which is of order
v8/r18 (in relative velocities and distances between the supergravitons), has the correct
scaling to match the rst correction to graviton scattering induced by higher order r4
curvature corrections [14] to d = 11 supergravity. although this observation originally
concerned two graviton scattering, we stress that two loops in the matrix theory corre-
sponds generically to three particle interactions. two particle scattering arises then only
as a sub-case in which the momenta of two of the three particles are identied. a genuine
three particle scattering computation involves a wide array of kinematical invariants and
therefore allows a detailed comparison of the tensorial structures of amplitudes in the two
theories. thanks to the absence of lower order r2 or r3 couplings, the correction to the
eikonal three graviton scattering in d = 11 supergravity induced by the m-theoretic r4
term is easily computed via feynman diagrams and takes a rather simple form, as we will
see in what follows.

we should remark that this question has been studied before in the context of two
graviton scattering [15] where it was found that while the scaling dependence in v, r,
the planck mass m and the compactied radius r is indeed correct, there is however a
mismatch of factors of n. in principle one may be content with this mismatch but a number
of questions remain open. in particular one might think that the simple introduction of
the factors of n in what really amounts to an n = 2 calculation in [15] is somewhat naive
since it does not take into account bound state eects. this is reected in the fact that we
have no control over the matrix theory lsz procedure for two or three particle scattering
for arbitrary values of n, essentially because the ground-state matrix theory wavefunction
is still unknown1. from the viewpoint of the nite n matrix conjecture of susskind [4],
however, we are no longer subject to such a restriction. is it then possible to nd a stronger
and more conclusive test? we believe that a detailed comparison of tensorial structures
of the three graviton amplitudes of the two models provides such a test. in addition the
abovementioned precise and complete agreement found for 3  3 graviton scattering at
leading order to be presented, gives one great condence in our methods.
the results of our analysis show a denitive disagreement between the next to leading
matrix theory and quantum corrected supergravity amplitudes. we nd dierent tensorial
structures in the amplitudes of the two models, thus ruling out the proposed correspondence
of v8 two loop matrix theory and r4 corrected supergravity.
the outline of the paper is as follows. we present our supergravity computation of
eikonal three graviton scattering at leading order in subsection 2.1 and include the r4
correction in subsection 2.2. in section three we turn to matrix theory, where we compute
the leading s-matrix contribution to three-particle scattering; in section four we expand
this amplitude to obtain the next-to-leading v8 term. in the conclusions, we present the
possible viewpoints explaining the mismatch we have found.

1progress towards understanding at least the asymptotics of the ground-state wavefunction may be

found in [16, 17].

we want to study three graviton scattering at tree level. at this order, as can be easily
seen from the supergravity action (1), the only contribution comes from the pure gravity
sector, that is the einstein-hilbert term. in particular, in our computations we shall need
the three-graviton and four-graviton vertices arising from its expansion. these are rather
lengthy expressions and may be found in [18].

we consider now the elastic scattering process 1 + 2 + 3  1 + 2 + 3 of three gravitons
into three gravitons and concentrate only on the terms in the amplitude proportional to

as discussed in the introduction, we deliberately omitted the n-dependence in the formulae
above, because we have complete control of our lsz matrix theory procedure for n = 1
only. anyway they can be easily reintroduced with the net result that (10) takes an overall
factor of n1n2n3, where ni is the p momentum of the graviton i and where we normalize
each external leg with a factor of 1/ni.

mentum transfer expansion, to the eikonal three graviton scattering involving the higher
derivative r4 term.

the explicit form of the eight tensor t8 is given, e.g., in [20] for the ten-dimensional
case. the tensor t8 entering in (11),(12), is obtained by trivially extending the range of
the indices to include the eleventh coordinate. from a supergravity point of view the
(linearized) couplings in (11) arise as counter terms coming from a one loop four graviton
scattering [21, 22]. in this respect the coecient in (11) would be uv divergent, but its
nite value is xed by requiring consistency with results obtained in iia and iib string
theory [21]. explicit computations have excluded the presence of one loop counter terms
of the form r2 or r3 in d = 11 supergravity3. it is then not dicult to realize that the
rst leading contribution to the eikonal three graviton scattering involving the couplings

3strictly speaking what has been computed in the literature is the background eective action with
background elds on-shell in which case the absence of r2 and r3 curvature corrections has been explicitly

(11), is the unique graph shown in gure 2, that involves the linearized piece of each of
the four riemann tensors appearing in (12). any other possible contribution, involving
for instance y-type or re-scattering-type graphs will be either sub-dominant in a small
velocity and momentum transfer expansion or outside the eikonal kinematical regime. we
then need to compute only one tree level graph with the insertion of the r4 term as shown
in gure 2 (up to permutations of the external legs). this can be most easily done by
noticing that the linearized tensorial structure appearing in (12) is precisely the same as
that obtained by computing four graviton tree level scattering in a theory of pure gravity in
any space-time dimension [18] 4. by using the results of [18] the computation of the graph
in gure 2 is then greatly simplied. we nd that the result for the part of the amplitude
with the external polarizations contracted as in (3) and in the kinematical parameterization
(4), can be written as follows (neglecting an overall coecient):

(13)

where  was dened in (8). a clarication is now needed. the result (11), from which
we computed the graph in gure 2 using the kinematics (4), applies strictly to eleven un-
compactied space-time dimensions. however, the correspondence with matrix theory at
nite n requires a compactication on an almost time-like circle [4]. this means that we
should have rst compactied the theory on a spacelike circle and then performed a compu-
tation analogous to that reported in [21], e.g. a one loop four graviton scattering with two
of them, according to gure 2, carrying equal and non-vanishing kaluza klein momentum.
this would give the counter term of the form (11) which has the correct compactied radius
r and planck constant 11 dependence to match the two loop matrix theory computa-
tion we consider in this article, but also terms with inappropriate r dependence, namely
the analogs of the (3)/r3 found in [21] for the case of four graviton scattering with all
external legs carrying vanishing kaluza klein momentum. to reach the discrete light cone
kinematics of (4) one must take the limit r  0, so that such additional terms should, in
principle, not be neglected. however, our philosophy is to study only those terms having
the right dependence in the radius r and planck constant 11 to match two-loops in matrix
theory perturbation theory. in particular, (13) does not represent the complete eikonal,
leading r4 correction at the three graviton scattering for d = 11 supergravity on a circle,
but only the terms that have a chance to be reproduced by a perturbative two loop matrix

veried by fradkin and tseytlin [23]. however it is an old result [24] that the s-matrix may be obtained
from the on-shell background eective action by substitution of an iterative solution to the full eld
equations of the form gcl
m n is an asymptotic eld on mass shell depending
physical polarizations (in particular, here we must take gas
m n to be an asymptotic scattering solution in
a at background). in practice, this amounts to adding all possible trees to the eective vertices given
by (11).

m n +  where gas

m n = gas

4it should be noted that in this fashion one only obtains the on-shell vertex function. the key observa-
tion is that in the eikonal and spin-less limit (where one discards terms cancelling the double pole as well
as contractions of momenta with polarizations) the two a priori o-shell legs entering the r4 vertex are
eectively put on-shell.

theory computation involving supergravitons. the n-dependence of (13), that we omit-
ted, is easily computed to be globally of order n 5, in disagreement with the n 3 dependence
arising at two loops in matrix theory. this reproduces indeed the disagreement found in
[15].

3 scattering gravitons in matrix theory

we now turn to the two loop matrix theory calculation, which has been carefully computed
to leading order by okawa and yoneya [7]. we have reconsidered their computation and
nd results in accordance with theirs. importantly, however, we rectify a hole in the original
supergravity matrix theory agreement presented in [7].
in more detail, the technical
assumption made by okawa and yoneya that all inner products of impact parameters bij
and relative velocities vij vanish, {b  v} = 0, can be shown to pose no restriction for one
and two particle dynamics. but for three particles it constitutes a genuine restriction. we
will show that this restriction may be dropped rather easily in our framework of comparing
s-matrices.

3.1 the setup

let us summarize the okawayoneya result in our notation. the euclidean matrix theory
action reads (setting the yangmills coupling and compactied radius to unity)

n  n matrices, (m = 1, . . . , 9 and  = 1, . . . , 16). moreover we employ a real symmetric
representation for the dirac matrices m in which the charge conjugation matrix c equals
unity. the background eld eective action is computed as an expansion of the bosonic

we will focus on the leading spin-independent terms in scattering amplitudes, we do not
consider fermionic background elds. manifestly, this background solves the classical equa-
tions of motion. thanks to the decoupling of the free u(1) center of mass sector of the
model, all one and higher loop results may be expressed in terms of the relative quantities
vij  vi  vj and rij(t) = bij + vijt.
one proceeds by xing a background eld gauge and adding appropriate ghost couplings
and kinetic terms. the propagators for all uctuations may be expressed in terms of the

the background. there are three possible topologies, the dumbbell, setting sun and gure
eight denoted oo, y and v , respectively5 as depicted in gure 3 in t hooft double line
notation. we remark that, as can clearly be seen from the matrix theory lsz formalism
formulated in [8, 9, 25], one must compute all matrix theory graphs, one particle irre-
ducible, connected-reducible and disconnected6. the latter we disregard since it is easy to
see that they can only correspond to disconnected graphs on the supergravity side. how-
ever, as we shall see, graphs of the connected-reducible type (such as the dumbbell graph)
reproduce re-scattering processes in supergravity [12].

(22)

the okawayoneya computation of the function py is an impressive technical achievement
and the result is a quadratic polynomial in the variables rij(t+) and t (the result itself is
given by equation (3.47) of [7] along with three pages of the appendices of that work). its
correctness (at least to leading order in vij) is well tested by comparison with supergravity.
a remark on the n dependence of the two loop eective action 2 loop is in order.
the planar two loop graphs of gure 3 carry three independent u(n) indices (i, j, k)
thus giving rise to three body interactions. for backgrounds consisting of three blocks

proportional to unit matrices of size ni (i = 1, 2, 3, withpi ni = n) the sumspijk reduce
to n1n2n3 p3

ijk=1 and 2 loop scales homogeneously like n 3 to all orders in vij, precisely
like the corresponding supergravity term (10). this procedure, however, has from our
viewpoint no real justication and we will therefore take ni = 1 in the following.

up to now we have simply restated the results of [7]. in what follows we compare these
results with the tree level supergravity s-matrix and in doing so show how to relax the
restriction {b  v} = 0. thereafter, the same techniques will be employed to compare the
next to leading order in vij matrix theory prediction with one loop supergravity.

3.2 y contribution to the matrix theory s-matrix

let us begin with the most dicult contribution y of (22). one might suspect that
since the result depends on three proper time parameters 1, 2 and 3 the result ought
correspond to the triple pole structure of the y-type diagrams in supergravity and indeed
this naive suspicion will be borne out in the following. according to the matrix theory
lsz formalism [8, 9, 25] the leading spin independent 1 + 2 + 3  1 + 2 + 3 matrix theory
s-matrix is given by

s33 =z d9b1d9b2d9b3 exp(iq1  b1 + iq2  b2 + iq3  b3) 2 loop .

(23)

9

note that we have dropped contributions corresponding to disconnected processes (so that
2 loop no longer appears in the exponent). the transverse kinematics described by (23)
are initial and nal momenta

pi = vi  qi/2
p
i = vi + qi/2 ,

i = 1, 2, 3 ,

(24)

in accord with the supergravity kinematics (4). note that at this stage vi is not a velocity
anymore, but rather the average momentum of the ith particle vi = (pi + p
i)/2, for details
see [8, 9, 25]. since 2 loop only depends on relative quantities, the integral over the average
impact parameter (b1 +b2 +b3)/3 yields the usual momentum conserving (9)(q1 +q2 +q3)
which we drop from now on. concentrating on the y contribution we then have

the leading contribution to three body scattering should depend on the sixth power of
velocities v12, v23 and v31 as can be seen from the supergravity amplitude (10). however,
if one examines the polynomial py , its leading behavior is quadratic in velocities and the
propagators  are to leading order velocity independent. in order to see explicitly how
the cancellations of the terms quadratic and quartic in velocities occur, two observations
are needed. firstly, examining the t dependence of the exponent in (25) arising from the
three propagators  dened in (17)

(v2

12 coth(1v12) + v2

23 coth(2v23) + v2

 t2

 p ,

(26)

one sees that under the gaussian t integral, all terms linear in t can be discarded by
symmetric integration and terms proportional to t2
 may be replaced by 1/(2p ). secondly,
observe that the operator d/dt+ acting on the three propagators  in (25) yields the factor

(27)
now recall that py is a polynomial quadratic in r12(t+), r23(t+) and r31(t+). however,
intuitively one may expect that terms of order two and four in velocity should not depend
on the impact parameters bi since, in the case of one and two particle kinematics, shifts
of the zero of t+ can always be made in such a fashion as to arrange that rij(t+)  vijt+.
this in fact is the case since at orders two and four in velocity, the rij dependence of py
can be expressed as q(terms order one in velocity). writing q as d/dt+ acting on the s
and subsequently integrating by parts removes all dependence on r12, r23 and r31. coupled
with the rst observation, one in fact nds miraculously that all terms proportional to
squares and the fourth power of velocity cancel [7]. we stress that no restriction involving
inner products of velocities and impact parameters must be imposed for this cancellation
to take place.

10

it is now advantageous to interchange the dt+ and d9b integrals and thereafter shift
the integration variable b13  r13(t+) along with b23  r23(t+) so that the t+ integral
may be performed yielding an energy conserving delta function

mn are functions of the i, rij and vij only (ab = (12, 23, 31)) and their

we proceed by interchanging the fourier integrals over r13 and r23 with those over
proper time i parameters. if we content ourselves with leading order in velocities, the r

although we leave the orchestration of the two loop leading velocity matrix theory result

3.3 v contribution to the matrix theory s-matrix

compared with the y contribution, the computation of the s-matrix elements arising
from the v terms are very straightforward. the leading contribution from v as given
in (21) is seen by inspection to be order six in velocity. hence, interchanging dt and d9b
integrals as above and thereafter performing the fourier transforms and proper time i
integrations we nd (suppressing delta functions over energy and momentum)

we emphasize that the result (32) mixes with terms arising from dumbbell graphs oo
which we will consider next. thus a comparison to supergravity is not possible until we
consider the sum of all matrix theory feynman diagrams, which has been the source of
some confusion in the literature [26, 27].

3.4 oo contribution to the matrix theory s-matrix
the nal matrix theory contribution to the leading order 3  3 s-matrix is given by the
dumbbell diagrams. in [12] it has been shown that these graphs can be given the interpre-
tation of recoil corrections to a source probe approximation. in feynman diagram language
there is, of course, no articial distinction into recoil and non-recoil terms (physically since
one nds that v and oo contributions mix, this is certainly the case).

to extract the s-matrix contribution from oo as given in (19) and (20) we begin by

writing the free massless propagator for a scalar eld in one dimension as

(t1  t2) =z d

2

ei(t1t2)
2 + i

.

(34)

the explicit time derivatives appearing in the truncated tadpoles (20) may, integrating by
parts, be converted to s. then, in the same fashion explained above, interchanging d9b
and time integrals and shifting b  r(t), then performing the resulting fourier transforms
and proper time integrals we nd

note that we have kept only the leading velocity dependence and discarded terms in the
sum over u(n) indices i, j and k in which the inner loop running around each end of
the dumbbell takes the same value since one may convince oneself that these terms can
only correspond to disconnected processes7. now, the integral over t = (t1  t2)/2 yields

(2  + qj  vji  qk  vki) and the t+ = (t1 + t2)/2 integral yields the usual energy conserving
delta function which we suppress as usual. the integral over  is then trivial and gives
the nal result

observe in particular that here the rst term and its permutations exactly cancels the
contribution from s33
in (33). clearly then, one sees that from a physical viewpoint the
split into recoil and non-recoil terms is an artifact of ones approximation scheme. in a
feynman graph approach, where one simply computes all terms contributing at a given
order in velocity there is no need to make such a distinction so long as one also computes
all feynman diagrams on the matrix theory side.
v +s33

oo as given in equations (32), (33) and (36)
reproduces the tree level supergravity result (10). no restriction upon impact parameters
or velocities has been made in this comparison and this result represents the completion
of the leading order spin-independent three graviton scattering problem whose tortuous
history may be followed in the sequence of articles [26, 29, 30, 7].

finally, we see that the sum s33

4 next to leading order: can matrix theory see r4

corrections?

armed with the above clear cut scheme for the computation of matrix theory s-matrix
elements and given the precise agreement of the tree level supergravity amplitude with the
leading matrix theory result, we now turn to the question of whether matrix theory is
sensitive to the one loop corrections to the m-theory eective action discussed in section
2.2. a simple dimensional analysis indicates that the next to leading order contributions to
the two loop matrix theory eective action, i.e. the terms of order v8/(r18 r7 m 24), have
the correct dependence on v, r, the eleven-dimensional planck mass m and compactication
radius r to match the r4 correction of (11) [13].
as mentioned in the introduction, this question has been already studied for two gravi-
ton scattering in [15], where a mismatch of factors n between supergravity and matrix
theory was found. however, our philosophy here is quite dierent, since we perform an
analysis of tensorial structures in both theories which will allow us to give more denite
and stronger conclusions.

the setup of the computation is now clear. we simply expand all terms in the two loop
eective action 2 loop of (18) to order v8 and apply the same manipulations discussed in
the last section to obtain the matrix theory amplitudes.

that is the proper time integrals remain to be performed8. we rst note that none of the
2 q2
terms in (38) and (39) displays a genuine two pole structure h1i = 1/(q2
3) as found in the
supergravity amplitude (13), such terms, however, will arise from the s33
|v8 contribution
y
to be studied.
an immediate disagreement arises from the rst term of (38) with a re-scattering
pole 1/(q2  v12), whereas on the supergravity side re-scattering diagrams of the type (c)
of gure 1 are absent since there are no r2 and r3 curvature corrections to the eective
m-theory action, as argued in section 2.2. note also that s33

see for example [31]; one must interpret the logarithm in (41) as log(q2/2) for some momentum scale 
which can only be determined by some physical principle.

14

hence it is clear that matrix theory produces terms with no counterpart on the supergrav-
ity side. however, taking a conservative viewpoint one could argue that only the truly
eikonal terms with a double pole 1/(q2
3) structure should be compared on both sides. a
similar phenomenon occurred in the computation of polarization dependent two graviton
scattering amplitudes [8], where the spin dependent contributions to the matrix theory
amplitude gave rises to terms cancelling the 1/q2 pole and had to be dropped.

2 q2

taking this viewpoint we would have to conclude that all terms in (38) and (39) are

spurious and we need to go on to the rather involved computation of y at order v8.

note that the permutations in the above formula act on the objects (v1, q1, 2), (v2, q2, 3)

ponent of (43)).

amongst these terms it is now instructive to focus on a specic class of terms in the

supergravity amplitude (13). we choose to study terms with the structure

5 conclusions

in this work we have presented detailed comparisons between three graviton scattering
amplitudes in matrix theory and d = 11 supergravity along with its leading m-theoretic
curvature corrections. on the one hand we have been able to complete and unify the
results of [7, 12] showing that the leading order v6 eikonal spin independent s-matrices of
tree level supergravity and two loop matrix theory exactly agree. on the other hand, the
moment one studies the next to leading order v8 matrix theory amplitude, the result fails
to match the corresponding (conjectured) term in r4-corrected supergravity. why does
such a mismatch occur ?
in trying to answer this most pressing of questions, let us begin by noting that our
results pertain most strongly to the susskind nite n formulation of the matrix theory
conjecture [4]. susskinds conjecture has be proven to be literally true in [32], i.e. m-
theory on a light-like circle with n units of compactied momentum is described by u(n)
matrix theory. the real issue is what it implies for comparison with d = 11 supergravity.
m-theory on a lightlike circle is lorentz equivalent to m-theory on a vanishing spacelike
circle [32]. on the contrary, supergravity is a good eective description of m-theory at
low energy and at the same time when the radius of compactication is large (so that all

16

possible wrapped membranes are decoupled). in terms of the string coupling constant gs,
for instance, this shows that perturbative matrix theory and supergravity computations
are really trust-able in two dierent regions (respectively at small and large values of
gs)9. it is then evident that no agreement should be expected a priori, except for those
amplitudes which are somehow protected from receiving any correction as one moves from
one regime to the other. in view of the agreement found for tree level two and three particle
scattering amplitudes, this appears to be the case for the terms of order v4 and v6 in the
matrix theory eective action as has been shown in [34] for the u(2) and u(3) models.
from this viewpoint the nite n matrix theory conjecture, extended to the supergravity
regime, would require the existence of an innite number of non-renormalization theorems.
however, our two loop order v8 result indicates that there exists no non-renormalization
theorem for these terms in the super yang-mills quantum mechanics.

the underlying type iia string theory itself can be employed to understand the rela-
tionship between perturbative matrix theory and low energy m-theory. in particular the
extensive agreement of one loop spin dependent terms for 2  2 scattering can be easily
understood by considering the scale independence of the string theory cylinder/annulus
amplitude between two d0 particles [33, 8, 9]. indeed arguments supported also by the
string theory picture suggest that, if visible perturbatively, the eects due to the r4 term
may correspond to a ve-loop non-planar contribution in matrix theory 10 [35]. on the
other hand there is no perturbative string derivation of a correspondence between the
next-to-leading v8 two loop term and the r4 amplitude given in (13).
aside from the possibility of discovering new non-renormalization theorems and al-
though there were no real expectations for an agreement between two-loop matrix theory
and r4 supergravity corrections, neither was there a denitive argument or computation
to rule it out. we believe that our work gives a nal (negative) answer to this question.
finally, an obvious question to ask is whether one should nd further agreements with
tree level supergravity. interestingly enough, in light of the simple feynman diagrammatic
understanding of semi-classical recoil eects given in this work, further comparison be-
tween matrix theory and tree-level supergravity amplitudes can be contemplated for four
graviton scattering (i.e. three-loop level in the quantum mechanical model). in [27] it has
been argued that at this order disagreement is possible, but there is no denite answer yet.
as we have seen within our formalism of comparing directly s-matrices, it is quite easy
to single out particular tensorial sub-structures. in this way the analysis could be greatly
simplied and yet remain conclusive.

9roughly speaking this is due to the fact that matrix theory is a good description of physics at

substringy distances, whereas supergravity is a good description at long wavelengths.

10although again the agreement would require a very non-trivial matching of amplitudes computed in

dierent regimes.
