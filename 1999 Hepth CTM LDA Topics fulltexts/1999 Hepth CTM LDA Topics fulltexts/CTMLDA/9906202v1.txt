abstract

we consider a 1 + 1 dimensional eld theory constrained to a nite box of
length l. traditionally, calculations in a box are done by replacing the in-
tegrals over the spatial momenta by discrete sums and then evaluating sums
and doing analytic continuations. we show that it is also possible to do such
calculations using an analogy to nite temperature eld theory. we develop a
formalism that is similar to the closed time path formulation of nite temper-
ature eld theory. our technique can be used to calculate spatially retarded
green functions, without evaluating sums or doing analytic continuations. we
calculate the self energy in a simple scalar theory as an example.

i. introduction

we consider a 1 + 1 dimensional eld theory constrained to a nite box in the spatial
dimension. we show that this system can be studied in two dierent ways. we can impose
the boundary condition in the usual way by restricting the momentum variable to take
discrete values k = 2n/l and replacing the momentum integral by a sum over the discrete
index. we will refer to this type of calculation as a box calculation. we will show that we
can formulate this theory in a simpler way, based on an analogy with nite temperature eld
theory. this approach will be called the csp [closed space path] formalism (the notation
will be explained below). we study the self energy function for a simple scalar theory and
compare the results of the box calculation and the csp calculation.

the motivation is as follows. there are physical systems in which the physics is essentially
1 + 1 dimensional. one example is a micromaser, where one is interested in the situation
where a beam of excited atoms enters a box, interacts with a radiation eld which is trapped
inside the box, and emerges from the other end. the standard non-relativistic description of
this system is the jaynes-cummings model which describes a reservoir of two level atoms in
interaction with a single mode oscillator representing a coherent electromagnetic eld [1]. it
has been shown that this simple non-relativistic model can be obtained as the non-relativistic
limit of a relativistic quantum eld theory [2]. the micromaser is studied experimentally by
measuring the probability that an atom will emerge in the excited state, given that it entered

1

in the excited state. it is known that this probability exhibits oscillations, which are known as
rabi oscillations. non-relativistically, it is straightforward to obtain these oscillations from a
calculation of transition amplitudes using the jaynes-cummings hamiltonian. to obtain the
relativistic generalization of this result, we need to calculate the imaginary part of the atomic
self energy. measurements of the nal atomic state are performed at a specic point in space,
and thus it is the spatially retarded self energy that is relevant, and not the time retarded
one. one can obtain this spatially retarded self energy in a straightforward way using the
csp formalism. the csp formalism is constructed in analogy to the closed time path
formalism (ctp) of nite temperature eld theory [35] and has the same advantages with
respect to the box calculation as the ctp formalism has over the imaginary time formalism
of nite temperature eld theory [68]. the csp formalism allows us to obtain spatially
retarded green functions without explicitly worrying about the diculties associated with
analytic continuation.

it is straightforward to see the similarity between a 1 + 1 dimensional eld theory con-
strained to a box and nite temperature eld theory. finite temperature eld theory involves
expectation values of operators weighted with boltzmann factors,

hoi = xn hn|eho|ni

the boltzmann factor is equivalent to an imaginary time evolution operator,

hoi = xn hn(x); t  i|o|n(x); ti

if the system obeys periodic boundary conditions such that

then we have

n(t  i) = n(t)

hoi = nhn(t)|o|n(t)i

thus, imposing a periodic boundary condition (in imaginary time) is equivalent to taking
expectation values that are weighted with a distribution function eh, which means that
nite temperature eld theory can be formulated as a eld theory constrained to a box in
imaginary time. this constraint is imposed at the level of the action by using momentum
expansions of the elds with the fourier integral over the zeroth momentum component
replaced by a sum over the discrete values k0 = 2int . the generating functional leads
to feynman rules which are the same as the zero temperature rules except that the zero
momentum components take discrete values, and the part of the loop integral that corre-
sponds to integrals over the zeroth momentum components are replaced by summations.
in the evaluation of feynman integrals, these sums are replaced by contour integrals that
contain distribution functions which have poles at the same discrete values k0 = 2int .
these contour integrals can be rotated so that the integration contour encloses the real axis,
running from negative innity to positive innity above the real axis, and backwards from
positive innity to negative innity below the real axis. this contour is called the closed
time path contour.

2

we want to consider a 1 + 1 dimensional eld theory constrained to a box in real space,
instead of a box in imaginary time. to achieve this, we will dene a eld theory on a
contour that encloses the real x-coordinate axis. this closed space path (csp) formalism
will be mathematically very similar to the ctp formalism of nite temperature eld theory.
consider what is involved in reversing the roles of space and time. relativistically, time
and coordinate variables play similar roles. the usual formulation of a quantum eld theory
uses the fact that the system contains both positive and negative energy states which move
forward and backward in time respectively. propagators are constructed as symmetric linear
combinations of these states. the conventional choice of energy eigenstates as basis states
gives a physical non-relativistic limit. in the non-relativistic limit, the positive and negative
eigenstates are separated, and the non-relativistic theory contains energy states of one sign
only. this restriction corresponds to the fact that in the non-relativistic world, time runs
only in the forward direction, and physical states are positive energy states. relativistically,
the special nature of time emerges only in statistical situations. when a system consists
of many degrees of freedom which form a heat bath, then the system will move towards
equilibrium, and the forward time direction is singled out as the physical direction.

now consider our situation. the csp formalism is mathematically similar to the ctp
formalism with the roles of space and time reversed. the rigorous procedure for constructing
the csp formalism is presented in detail in section 3. propagators are constructed as
symmetric combinations of positive and negative momentum eigenstates, moving forward
and backward in coordinate space. the imaginary time box of nite temperature eld theory
is replaced by a box in real space, and the parameter  = 1/t which characterizes the length
of the box in imaginary time is replaced with a parameter il where l is the length of the
box in coordinate space. the boltzmann factor ep0 which gives the exponential decay that
leads to equilibration, is replaced by a factor eilp which gives rise to oscillatory behaviour.
thus, in contrast to the nite temperature case, the system maintains its ability to evolve
in both spatial directions, even after statistical eects have been included.

this paper is organized as follows. we work with a simple scalar theory with a lagrangian

of the form,

in section 2 we discuss standard eld theory in 1 + 1 dimensions at nite temperature.
in section 3 we derive the csp formulation of eld theory in a box in 1 + 1 dimensions,
working in analogy with the standard nite temperature formulation outlined in section 2.
we calculate the self energy using this csp formalism. in section 4 we calculate the self
energy using the box technique. in section 5 we compare the results of the two calculations,
and discuss our conclusions.

ii. field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions

in the next two sections we consider a non-interacting scalar eld of mass m.

we start from the kleingordon equation of motion,

a. quantization

t  2
(2

x + m2) = 0

(2)

the solution of the kleingordon equation has the form

  ei(ktkx);

k = k2 + m2

and describes the propagation of a plane wave of energy . this equation of motion should
be obtainable from a least action principle. if the action is dened in terms of a lagrange
density as,

then the equation of motion is determined from

i = z ldt

which allows us to identify,

i = 0 


t

l =

[(t)2  (x)2  m22]

to quantize the system we go to the hamiltonian formalism. we dene canonical mo-

we can write these results as poisson brackets:

t = {,h}; t = {,h}

to quantize we supplement the initial conditions by the equal time commutation relations
(etcrs)

and replace the poisson brackets with commutation relations,

[(x, t), (x, t)] = i(x  x)

(5)

it = [, h];

it = [, h];

h(t) = z dxh(x, t)

has for its zero-zero component:

from the conservation equation  = 0 we obtain,

00 = h

d

dt z dxh =

dt

h = 0

which means that the eigenvalues of h are conserved quantities, and the eigenstates of h
are stationary states. note that (6) has solution

(x, t) = eiht(x, 0)eiht; (x, t) = eiht(x, 0)eiht,

which identies h as the generator of translations in time.

c. propagators

next we consider momentum-space expansions of the eld variables. we use the sta-
tionary eigenstates of the hamiltonian as basis states and expand around solutions of the
kleingordon equation (2) by writing,

(x, t) = z

dk0

2(2k)

[a(k)ei(ktkx) + a(k)ei(ktkx)]

(7)

where k = k2 + m2. the creation and annihilation operators satisfy the commutation
relation,

[a(k), a(p)] = 2(2k)(k  p)

(8)

as a consequence of (3) and (5). the interpretation of this expression is as follows. the
frequency k is always positive. the operator a(k) creates a mode of energy k which
propagates forward in time, and the operator a(k) destroys a mode of energy k, which is
equivalent to creating a mode with negative energy that propagates backwards in time (an
anti-particle). thus, by expanding in this set of creation and annihilation operators we use
a basis set that separates positive and negative energy eigenstates. this basis choice allows
us to dene time causal propagators,

idr(x, t; y, t) = (t  t)[(x, t), (y, t)]
dr(k) =

1

(k0 + i)2  k2  m2 =

1

(k0 + i)2  2

k

(9)

where translation invariance has been used in taking the fourier transform.

5

d. finite temperature field theory

finite temperature eld theory involves expectation values of operators weighted with

boltzmann factors,

the boltzmann factor is equivalent to an imaginary time evolution operator which gives,

hoi = xn hn|eho|ni

hoi = xn hn(x); t  i|o|n(x); ti

we impose periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time,

n(t  i) = n(t)

this constraint leads to feynman rules which are the same as the zero temperature rules
except that the zero momentum components take discrete values k0 = 2int , and the part
of the loop integral that corresponds to integrals over the zeroth momentum components are
replaced by summations. in the evaluation of feynman integrals, these sums are replaced by
contour integrals that contain distribution functions which have poles at the same discrete
values k0 = 2int . these contour integrals can be rotated so that the integration contour
encloses the real axis, running from negative innity to positive innity above the real axis
(the branch c1), and backwards from positive innity to negative innity below the real axis
(the branch c2). this contour is called the closed time path (ctp) contour. the propagator
can be written as a 2  2 matrix of the form,

g =   g11 g12
g21 g22 !

(10)

where g11 is the propagator for elds moving along c1, g12 is the propagator for elds
moving from c1 to c2, etc. the four components are given by,

g11(x  y ) = iht (x)(y ))i
g12(x  y ) = ih(y )(x)i
g21(x  y ) = ih(x)(y )i
g22(x  y ) = ih t ((x)(y ))i

(11)

where t is the usual time ordering operator and t is the anti-chronological time ordering
operator. these four components are related by the condition,

and therefore only three are independent. we dene the physical combinations,

g11 + g12 + g21 + g22 = 0

gr = g11  g12 = i(t  t)h[(x, t), (y, t)]i
ga = g11  g21 = i(t  t)h[(x, t), (y, t)]i
gf = g11 + g22 = ih{(x, t), (y, t)}i.

6

(12)

(13)

in momentum space the cyclicity of the trace allows us to obtain the relationship between
these propagators known as the kms condition,

gf (p ) = n(p0)(gr(p )  ga(p ))
n(p0) = 1 + 2n(p0) ;

n(p0) =

1

ep0  1

iii. the closed space path

a. formulation of the theory

we start with a kleingordon equation of the form,

t  2
(2

x  m2)(x, t) = 0

which has solutions,

.

(14)

(15)

  ei(k0tk0 x) ;

k0 = qk2

0 + m2

that describe the propagation of a plane wave with momentum k0. we should be able to
obtain the equation of motion from a least action principle of the form,

i = z l dx ;

 i = 0 


t

 l
(t) 

 l


= 0

the lagrangian that produces the correct equation of motion is,

l =

1
2

[x)2  (t)2  m22]

to obtain the hamiltonian we dene canonical momenta

 =

l
(x)

= x

and take the legendre transform,

h = x  l =

1
2

[(0)2 + ( )2 + m2]

obtaining hamiltonians equations in the usual way we get,

x =

 h
 

; x  =

 h


we can write these results as poisson brackets:

x = {, h}; x  = { , h}

7

(16)

(17)

to quantize we supplement the initial conditions with the equal place commutation relations
(epcrs)

and replace the poisson brackets with commutation relations,

[(x, t), (x, t)] = i(t  t)

ix = [, h] ;

ix  = [ , h] ;

h(x) = z dt h(x, t).

(18)

(19)

the energy momentum tensor is obtained from (6) as before. the 11 component is 11 =
 h and the constraint  = 0 leads to
d

dx z dt h = 0

which means that the eigenvalues of h are conserved and that the eigenstates are stationary
states. note that (19) has solutions,

(x) = ei hx(0)ei hx; (x) = ei hx(0)ei hx

which identies h as the generator of translations in space.

to obtain an expression for the propagators, we use a basis set of the stationary eigen-
states of the hamiltonian h and expand around solutions of the equation of motion (15) by
writing,

(x, t) = z

dk0

2(2k0)

[a(k0)ei(k0 xk0t) + a(k0)ei(k0 xk0t)].

the creation and annihilation operators satisfy the commutation relation,

[a(k0), a(p0)] = 2(2k0)(k0  p0)

(20)

(21)

the interpretation of this expansion is as follows. the operator a(k) creates a mode of
momentum k0 which propagates forward in space, and the operator a(k) destroys a mode
of momentum k0, which is equivalent to creating a mode with negative momentum that
propagates backwards in space. by expanding in momentum eigenstates, instead of energy
eigenstates, we have obtained a formalism in which it is simple to obtain propagators that
are retarded in space.

the space-retarded propagator is dened as,

idr(x, t; y, t) = d11  d12 = (x  y)[(x, t), (y, t)]

substituting in the expressions for the momentum expansions of the elds (20) and using
the epcrs (21) we obtain, in momentum space,

dr(k) = 

1

k2

0  (k + i)2 + m2 =

1

(k + i)2  2

k0

(22)

which can be compared to the result for the time-retarded propagator (9).

8

we can write the propagator in matrix form on the csp contour. the result is analogous

to the ctp form (10),

with (compare( 11)),

d =   d11 d12
d21 d22 !

d11(x  y ) = ihs(x)(y ))i
d12(x  y ) = ih(y )(x)i
d21(x  y ) = ih(x)(y )i
d22(x  y ) = ih s((x)(y )).i

(23)

(24)

the time ordering operator is replaced with a space ordering operator s, and s is the reverse
space ordering operator. the four components are related by the condition (compare (12)),

d11 + d12 + d21 + d22 = 0

we dene the physical combinations (compare (13)),

dr = d11  d12 = i(x  x)h[(x, t), (y, t)]i
da = d11  d21 = i(x  x)h[(x, t), (y, t)]i
df = d11 + d22 = ih{(x, t), (y, t)}i.

the kmslike condition is obtained by analogy with (14),

df (p ) = n(p)(dr(p )  da(p ))
n(p) = cot(
lp) = i(1 + 2n(p));

n(p) =

b. calculation of the imaginary part of the retarded self energy

we consider the contribution to the self energy of the eld 1 arising from a loop with
one 1 propagator and one 2 propagator on internal lines. other contributions to the 1
self energy can be obtained in a straightforward way by setting m1 = m2. the spatially
retarded self energy is given by,

r(p ) = (p )11 + (p )12

= i2z dk(d11(k)d11(k + p )  d21(k)d12(k + p ))
2 z dk(df (k)dr(p + k) + da(k)df (p + k))

= i

2

(28)

where dk = dk0 dk /(2)2, dr is given by (22), and da is the complex conjugate of dr.
we use the kms condition (27) to write,

9

df (k) = n(k)2iimdr(k) = 2in(k)(k)(k2  2
k0)

using the delta functions to do the k integrals we obtain,

r(p ) =

n(k0) 

k0

4em1,m2z dk0

k0+q0)2!
where em1,m2f (m1, m2) = f (m1, m2) + f (m2, m1). to get the imaginary part, we take the
imaginary part of the two fractions using

(p  k0 + i)2  (

(p + k0 + i)2  (

k0+q0)2 +

1

( + i)2  2! = i()(2  2)

the two terms can be combined using the symmetrization factor opf (p) = f (p)  f (p).
the result is,

iimr(p ) = i

we dene,

x = p 2  m2 + 2p0k0

which allows us to write,

[(k0 + p)2  (

k0+p0)2] = (x  ).

we rewrite the delta function using,

(x  ) = 2[(x)()  (x)()](x2  2)

we obtain,

x2  2 = 4p 2(k0  k01)(k0  k02)
2p 2 (p0(p 2  m2)  pr)

from which we derive,

substituting into (29) we obtain,

to simplify this result we expand out the symmetrization factor op using,

p  p  a1,2  a2,1

the result is,

iimr(p0, p) = i

2
8rem1,m2[n(p  a1)(p2  a2

(36)

iv. the box calculation

in this section we calculate the same contribution to the self energy using the standard
feynman rules of zero temperature eld theory, and explicitly constrain the system to a box
of length l. the self energy is given by,

(p ) = i2z dk

1
[k 2  m2

1 + i]

1

[(k + p )2  m2

2 + i]

.

(37)

we restrict the variable k to values k = 2n/l where l is the length of the box, and n is
an integer. the integral becomes,

(p0, pm) = i2z dk0

1

l xn  

1
n  m2

1 + i! 

k2
0  k2

(k0 + p0)2  (kn + pm)2  m2

1

2 + i! (38)

we can replace the sum over the discrete index by a contour integration:

11

f (p =

xn

2n
l

) =

1
2i

l

2 z dp cot(

1
2

lp )f (p)

(39)

where the contour is a clockwise loop that encloses the poles of the cotangent function which
lie along the real axis. this gives,

(p0, pm) = i

2

2 z dk0

2 z dk

1

1 + i! 

k2
0  k2  m2

(k0 + p0)2  (k + pm)2  m2

1

2 + i!

using (27) we rewrite the cotangent function,

cot(

1
2

lp) = i(1 + 2n(p)) = n(p)

(40)

we deform the contour to two semi-circles in the upper and lower half planes. we do the
k integral rst, picking up contributions from four poles. these four terms can be combined
using the two factors ep and em1,m2 where, epf (p) = f (p) + f (p). we use the notation
k0 = qk2
2 etc. note that these frequencies can be imaginary. when
doing the contour integral, it doesnt matter if the frequencies are real or imaginary, since
both halves of the contour form counter clockwise loops, and thus pole contributions from
both sides of the real axis have the same sign. the result is,

k0 = qk2

0  m2

0  m2

(p0, pm) =

2

8em1,m2epz dk0 n(k0)

k0

1

(k0 + pm)2  2

k0+p0  i

to nd the imaginary part of the spatially retarded piece we follow the analogous proce-
dure as that used for nite temperature eld theory in the imaginary time formalism: we
analytically continue pm to the whole complex p plane and take the discontinuity,

iimr(p0, p)=

1
2

((p + i)  (p  i))
2
8 em1,m2opz dk0 n(k0)

1
k0

(p + k0)[(k0 + p)2  2

k0+p0]

(41)

comparison of (41) with (29) shows immediately that

(imr(m2))box = (imr(m2))csp

(42)

note that this result is what we would have expected from (15) in which the mass term has
the opposite sign relative to (2).

v. conclusions

the result for the imaginary part of the spatially retarded self energy contains a cotangent
factor. this factor is a direct consequence of the fact that the system has been constrained
to a box, and gives rise to the 1 + 1 dimensional analogue of the rabi oscillations that
have been calculated non-relativistically from the jaynes-cummings model.
in our case
the oscillations are given by a cotangent function, instead of a sine or cosine function, and

12

thus are discontinuous. it is expected that this behaviour is an artifact of working in 1 + 1
dimensions.

we have shown that it is possible to obtain spatially retarded green functions for a
system conned to a box by using a formulation of eld theory that is similar to the closed
time path formulation of nite temperature eld theory. all of the powerful machinery of
the ctp method can be taken over when calculating in a one dimensional box by using the
csp formalism derived in this paper. we have calculated the self energy in a simple scalar
theory as an example, and veried that the result is related in a straightforward way to the
result that would be obtained in the traditional box calculation. the possible advantages
of our method are the same as those of the ctp method of nite temperature eld theory.
in particular, it is typically easier to generalize to higher n-point functions using such an
approach. when calculating in the traditional manner, it is necessary to do an analytic
continuation from discrete momentum values to the full complex plane, and this analytic
continuation becomes extremely complicated for higher n-point functions.
