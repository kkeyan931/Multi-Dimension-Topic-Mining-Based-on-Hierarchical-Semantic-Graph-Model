abstract

the study of the scaling limit of two-dimensional models of statistical mechanics

within the framework of integrable eld theory is illustrated through the example

of the rsos models. starting from the exact description of regime iii in terms of

colliding particles, we compute the correlation functions of the thermal, 1,2 and
(for some cases) spin operators in the two-particle approximation. the accuracy

obtained for the moments of these correlators is analysed by computing the central

charge and the scaling dimensions and comparing with the exact results. we further

consider the (generally non-integrable) perturbation of the critical points with both

the operators 1,3 and 1,2 and locate the branches solved on the lattice within
the associated two-dimensional phase diagram. finally we discuss the fact that the

rsos models, the dilute q-state potts model at and the o(n) vector model are all

described by the same perturbed conformal eld theory.

1 introduction

integrable eld theory emerged in the last years as an elegant and eective tool for the

study of many two-dimensional statistical models directly in their scaling limit. the

approach relies on the fact that a large class of quantum eld theories in (1+1) dimensions

admits an innite number of integrals of motions (i.e. they are integrable) and can be

completely solved on-shell [1, 2]. the matrix elements of local operators on the asymptotic

states are also exactly computable [3, 4] and lead to spectral series for the correlation

functions whose quantitative eectiveness is remarkable. among the statistical models

that have been studied in this framework we mention the ising model in a magnetic eld

[2, 5, 6, 7, 8], the q-state potts model [9, 10, 11, 12], the o(n) model [13, 14], and the

ashkin-teller model [15].

it is the purpose of this paper to illustrate how the programme outlined above applies

to the restricted solid-on-solid (rsos) models introduced by andrews, baxter and
forrester in ref. [16]. for any integer p  3 they are dened on the square lattice in
terms of a spin or height variable hi located at each site i and taking the integer values
from 1 to p. the heights of two nearest-neighbour sites i and j are constrained by the

condition

|hi  hj| = 1 ,

(1.1)

which, in particular, leads to a natural splitting of the lattice into two sublattices on which

the heights are all even or all odd. the hamiltonian is further specied by a one-site and

a diagonal interaction terms. their precise form does need to be reproduced here but it is

important that the energy of a conguration is invariant under the global tranformation

hi  p + 1  hi ,

(1.2)

which is the basic symmetry of the models.

in their general formulation the rsos models contain a number of parameters which

grows linearly with p. in ref. [16] the models were solved on two two-dimensional mani-

folds of the parameter space which can be parameterised by a temperature-like variable

t together with a second coordinate v measuring the spatial anisotropy of the lattice in-

teraction. the scaling limit, however, is isotropic and v will be ignored in the following.

hence, for each of the two solutions and for any p, the phase diagram reduces to a line

and exhibits a critical point separating two phases known as regimes i and ii (for the

rst solution) and regimes iii and iv (for the second solution). here, we will only be

interested in the second case, and more specically in regime iii.

1

by comparison of critical exponents, huse showed [17] that the critical points sepa-

rating regimes iii and iv for the dierent values of p correspond to the minimal unitary

series of conformal eld theories characterised by the values of the central charge [18, 19]

c = 1 

6

p(p + 1)

,

p = 3, 4, . . . .

(1.3)

these models contain a nite number of primary operators m,n(x) (m = 1, . . . , p  1;
n = 1, . . . , p) with scaling dimensions

xm,n =

[(p + 1)m  pn]2  1

2p(p + 1)

.

(1.4)

it was shown in ref. [20] that the unitary minimal models admit the landau-ginzburg

description

(1.5)

 ,

with g1 = g2 =    = gp2 = 0. the scalar eld (x) is then the continous version of the
shifted height variable hi  (p + 1)/2, in such a way that the reection symmetry (1.2) is
mapped into   . the following identications between normal ordered powers of 
and conformal operators hold [20]

k  k+1,k+1 ,

k = 0, . . . , p  2 .

(1.6)

the eective action (1.5) makes transparent that the considered series of critical points
corresponds to the (p  1)-critical behaviour of a system with scalar order parameter and
z2 symmetry, p = 3 being the ordinary ising universality class, p = 4 the tricritical ising,
and so on.

the rsos models in regimes iii and iv possess p  1 and p  2 degenerate ground
states, respectively [16], and can be described by the action (1.5) with suitable ne tunings

of the couplings gk leading to the appropriate number of degenerate minima in the eective
potential. for p = 3 the two regimes correspond to the low- and high-temperature phases

of the ising model in zero magnetic eld and are both massive in the scaling limit. for
p  4, while regime iii is still massive, regime iv become massless and corresponds to
the crossover between the critical points labelled by p and p  1 [21, 22].

solvability on the lattice naturally suggests integrability of the eld theory describing

the scaling limit. in fact, the scaling dimension of the thermal operator (conjugated to

t) is known from the lattice solution and coincide with x1,3, so that the scaling limit of
the rsos models in regimes iii and iv is described by the action

a = a(p)

cf t + z d2x 1,3(x) ,

2

(1.7)

where a(p)
cf t is the action of the conformal theories with central charge (1.3), and  is
a coupling with dimensions m2x1,3. this 1,3 perturbation of conformal eld theory is
known to be massive (regime iii) or massless (regime iv) depending on the sign of  [21],

and to be integrable in both directions [2]. the associated scattering theories are also

known [23, 24, 25].

the paper is organised as follows.

in the next section we briey review the exact

scattering description for regime iii and use it in section 3 for the computation of form

factors of the operators 1,3, 1,2 and (for p = 3, 4) 2,2. in section 4 we write down the
two-particle approximation for the correlation functions of these operators and analyse

its accuracy by computing the central charge and the scaling dimensions. section 5 is

devoted to a discussion of the perturbation of the rsos critical points with both the

operators 1,3 and 1,2. in the nal section we briey discuss the fact that the perturbed
conformal eld theory (1.7) also describe the scaling limit of the dilute q-state potts model
along its rst order phase transition lines for 0  q  4, as well as the o(n) vector model
for 2  n  2.

2 scattering theory

in a (1+1)-dimensional theory with degenerate vacua the elementary excitations are kinks

interpolating among these vacua. it is known from the lattice solution that the j-th ground
state in regime iii (j = 1, . . . , p 1) is such that all the sites on one sublattice have height
j and all the sites on the other sublattice have height j + 1 (fig. 1). the space-time

trajectory of a kink is a domain wall separating two dierent ground states. since the

pairing of two dierent ground states i and j can give an admissible conguration only
if |i  j| equals 1 (fig. 2), the elementary excitations of the scattering theory are kinks1
kij() interpolating between two vacua i and j = i  1. it follows from the precise form
of the lattice interaction that the interfacial tension between two ground states i and i + 1

does not depend on i, and this amounts to say that the kinks ki,i1 all have the same
mass. multikink excitations of the type

. . . ki1,i(1)ki,i1(2) . . .

(2.1)

will connect ground states with arbitrary indices.

1the rapidity variable  parameterises the on-shell momenta of the kink of mass m as (p0, p1) =

(m cosh , m sinh ).

3

in an integrable eld theory the scattering is completely elastic (no production pro-

cesses allowed) and multiparticle processes factorise into the product of the two-body

subprocesses, so that the problem of the determination of the s-matrix is reduced to the

computation of the two-kink amplitudes [1]. taking into account the kink composition

rules together with invariance under time reversal and spatial inversion, the allowed two-

kink processes are those depicted in fig. 3 and associated to the commutation relations

kj,j1(1)kj1,j(2) = a

j (1  2)kj,j1(2)kj1,j(1)
+ bj(1  2)kj,j1(2)kj1,j(1) ,

what ensures that there are no bound states and that the amplitudes given above entirely

determine the scattering theory.

3 form factors

let us denote (x) a local scalar operator of the theory with zero topological charge,
namely such that its action on the vacuum |0ji only produces excitations beginning and
ending on this vacuum. all the operators we will consider in the following share this

property. we are interested in the two-particle form factors (fig. 4)

f 
j,(1  2) = h0j|(0)|kj,j1(1)kj1,j(2)i .

eq. (2.3) implies the relation

f 
j,() = a

as a last necessary condition, the two-kink form factors are subject to the asymptotic

bound [5]

where x denotes the scaling dimension of the operator (x).

these requirements, together with (3.5) imply that the 
j () are polynomials in cosh(/2).
let us consider those operators (x) which are relevant in the renormalisation group sense
(x < 2) for all values of p  3. then, the bound (3.5) implies that these polynomials
are at most of degree one, which means that the operator subspace {} contains only two
independent relevant operators. the trace of the stress-energy tensor (x) is a relevant
operator and is even under the reection symmetry, so that f 
pj,(). moreover
h0j||0ji does not depend on j and, according to (3.4), the two-kink matrix elements have
no pole in  = i. all these requirements are fullled if we take

two-kink approximation (4.3) is known to provide results of remarkable accuracy for

integrated correlators (see [10] and references therein), as can be checked through the use

of the sum rules [26, 27]

allowing the determination of the ultraviolet conformal data (central charge and scaling

dimensions) in the form of moments of o-critical correlators.

in fig. 5 we compare the exact formula for the central charge (1.3) with the result

yielded by the two-kink approximation (4.3) in the sum rule (4.4). notice that p can be

considered as a continous parameter in the result of the latter computation, in agreement

with the fact that many observables in the theory (1.7) have a continous p-dependence.

with this remark in mind, in the remaining part of this section we will treat p as a real
number3  1.

for p = 1, in particular, the two-kink form factor (3.6), (3.13) simply reduces to
2m2(1)(1+i/)/2. this residual rapidity dependence ensures the normalisation condition
(3.14) but is immaterial in the computation of the correlator (4.3). hence, the theory (1.7)

at p = 1 is free and the two-kink computation for the central charge gives the exact result
c = 2. due to the equivalence between the ising model and a free neutral fermion, the
two-kink approximation is exact also for p = 3 and gives c = 1/2.

the computation of x through the sum rule (4.5) requires the knowledge of hi.
j,() due to the vanishing of the residue

although this quantity cannot be related to f 

(3.4), we dispose of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz result [25]

hi = m2 tan

.

(4.6)

2here and in the following we always refer to connected correlators.
3in doing that, of course we loose unitarity unless p is an integer larger than 2. here and in the

following the term unitarity refers to the absence of negative norm states in the hilbert space.

8

since 1,3(x) is the operator which drives the theory away from criticality, we must have

(x)  1,3(x) ,

(4.7)

and x = x1,3.

the two-kink computation of xe through (4.5) gives 1/4 at p = 1 and 1/8 at p = 3.
since the theory is free for these two values of p, these results are expected to be exact.
assuming that e(x) corresponds to a primary operator whose position in the kacs table
does not depend on p, they can be substituted into the formula (1.4) to x

in fig. 6 we compare the two-kink approximation for x and xe with the exact formulae

e(x)  1,2(x) .

x1,3 = 2

x1,2 =

p  1
p + 1
p  2

(4.9)

(4.10)

respectively. concerning the two values of p for which we determined the form factors of

the order parameter, the two-kink computation gives x = 1/8 at p = 3 and x = 0.0734
at p = 4. in view of the identication (x)  2,2(x), these results must be compared
with the exact values 1/8 and 3/40 = 0.075, respectively.

some comments are in order about the results yielded by the sum rules (4.4) and (4.5).

consider the moment

and denote 3(x) the leading operator determining the short distance behaviour

ik = z d2x|x|kh1(x)2(0)i ,

with

h1(x)2(0)i  h3i
|x|1 2

,

|x|  0

12  x1 + x2  x3 .

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

then ik is convergent if 2 + k  12 > 0.
 = 2x1,3 and e = x1,3, so that the sum rules for c and x1,2 converge for all nite
values of p, while the sum rule for x1,3 converges only for p < 3. this failure of the
sum rule for the scaling dimension due to the divergence of the integral is originated by

in the cases of interest for us we have

operator mixing under renormalisation and was discussed in ref. [27].

let us now discuss the issue of the accuracy of the results obtained using the ap-

proximated correlators (4.3) into the integrals (4.4) and (4.5). the spectral series for

9

the correlation functions is a large distance expansion and any partial sum including the

contributions up to n particles will appreciably depart from the exact result at suciently
small distances. in the moment (4.11), however, the factor |x|k causes a suppression of the
short distance contribution whose importance, for a xed k, depends on the high energy

behaviour of the form factors. the two-kink contribution to ik is given by

f 1
j,(2)f 2

j,(2)

(cosh )k+2

z d

.

(4.14)

the integrand here behaves asymptotically as exp[(k)
(k)
12  2 + k  y1  y2 ,

12], where

with y dened by

  + .
in an unitary theory, this exponent is subject to the bound [5]

f 
j,()  ey/2 ,

y  x .

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

we see that (k)
12 has to be positive to ensure the convergence of the integral and that
the suppression of the short distance contribution is proportional to this exponent. of

course, this observation does not determine the absolute accuracy of the two-particle

approximation, but it helps understanding the accuracy pattern exhibited in figs. 6. in

fact, the solutions of section 3 determine

y =

ye =

3(p  1)
2p
p  3
2p

.

(4.18)

(4.19)

then, (0)
 goes to zero as p  3 and we observe that the deviation of the two-kink
approximation for x from the exact result becomes large as we approach this value.
analogous considerations apply to the case of xe as p  . in the central charge sum
rule (4.4), on the contrary, (2)
 tends to 1 as p  , what means that the high energy
contribution is still strongly suppressed in this limit. the remarkable accuracy (1%) of
the two-kink approximation as p   shows that also the contributions with a larger
number of kinks undergo a similar suppression . the relation between (k)
12 and the
accuracy of the two-kink approximation (dened as the absolute deviation from the exact

result divided by the exact result) is illustrated in table 1 through few examples.

5 double perturbation and phase diagram

in this section we briey consider what happens if we add to the action (1.7) the operator
e  1,2, namely if we take4
a = a(p)

1,3(x) + z d2x (p)

cf t + z d2x (p)

1,2(x) .

(5.1)

within the usual conventions for the operator normalisations, the regime iii we considered

in the previous sections corresponds to  = 0 and  < 0. if  is very small we can use form

factor perturbation theory [8] around regime iii. the correction to the energy density j
of the vacuum |0ji is proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the perturbing
operator 1,2 computed at  = 0, and reads (remember (3.15) and (3.4))

j   h0j|1,2|0ji =  (1)jh01|1,2|01i .

(5.2)

this means that only a subset of alternating vacua among the p  1 degenerate vacua of
regime iii preserves the same energy when  is negative and  is small in (5.1). for p odd,

in particular, we see that the z2 symmetry characteristic of the case  = 0 is broken by
the 1,2 perturbation. for p = 3 the action (5.1) describes the ising model in a magnetic
eld [7, 8]. if p is odd the number of surviving degenerate vacua is (p  1)/2. if p is even,
instead, this number is p/2 or p/2  1 depending on the sign of .

it is clear that in presence of such a pattern of degeneracy breaking the kinks kj,j1 of
regime iii are no longer asymptotic excitations when  6= 0. rather, they will be conned
into pairs kj,j+1kj+1,j+2 providing the new stable kinks in the perturbed theory. this
phenomenon appears in the formalism when we try to compute the correction to the mass

of the kinks kj,j1, which is given by [8, 28]

m   f 1,2

j, (i) .

(5.3)

since the form factor on the r.h.s. has a pole at  = i (see (3.6) and (3.15)), it follows

that this correction is innite, a fact that reveals the removal of the kinks kj,j1 from the
spectrum of the asymptotic excitations.

the conformal eld theories with c < 1 perturbed with one of the operators 1,3,
1,2 or 2,1 are integrable [2]. it is then natural to look for solvable lattice models whose
scaling limit corresponds to these quantum eld theories. in ref. [29] a dilute version of

the rsos models was considered and found to be solvable on the lattice along four distinct

4when useful in this section we explicitely label the operators by the superscript (p) identifying the

critical point they refer to.

11

branches. it was found, in particular, that the scaling limit of branch 2 is described by
the action (5.1) with  = 0, and that for p odd this branch possesses (p 1)/2 degenerate
ground states. this result is consistent with our perturbative considerations and suggests
that they hold true for the whole region   0 in (5.1).

we already mentioned that for p > 3 the regime iv of the rsos models ( > 0,
 = 0 in (5.1)) corresponds to a massless ow to the critical point with action a(p1)
cf t . it

6 conclusion

in the central part of this paper we applied the s-matrixform factor approach to the

regime iii of the rsos models. these models, however, are not the only lattice models

whose scaling limit is described by the 1,3 perturbation of c < 1 conformal eld theories.
it is well known [30, 31, 32] that the same action (1.7) corresponds to the scaling dilute q-
state potts model at the critical temperature and zero external eld (with q = 4 cos2 /p 
[0, 4]), and to the scaling o(n) vector model in zero external eld (with n = 2 cos /p 
[2, 2]). the latter two models make sense for continous values of q and n through
mapping onto cluster and loop models, respectively. excepting special values of p (p = 3 in

particular) these three models are characterised by dierent internal symmetries and then

represent dierent universality classes of critical behaviour. in fact, the order parameter

has a dierent number of independent components in the three cases and corresponds to

dierent operators (see table 2). the fact that the three models are described by the

same action along the renormalisation group trajectories specied above means that the

theory (1.7) admits dierent microscopic descriptions distinguished by the choice of local
observables6. each description is characterised by a specic set of mutually local operators

with well dened transformation properties under the group of internal symmetry. of

course, the perturbing operator 1,3 appears in all these local sets and is invariant under

5the remaining two solvable branches of ref. [29] are not related to perturbations of the critical points

considered in this paper.

6famous examples of this kind of situation are the equivalence between the ising model and free

neutral fermions, or that between the sine-gordon and massive thirring models.

12

the dierent symmetry groups. the observables associated to this operator, e.g.
correlation length critical exponent  = 1/(2  x1,3), are the same in the three cases.

at the conformal level, the possibility of dierent local descriptions appears through

the

the existence of dierent modular invariant partition functions for the same value of the

central charge c [33, 34, 35]. in the s-matrix approach away from criticality the dierent

nature of the order parameter leads to the existence of dierent scattering descriptions for

the action (1.7). they all exhibit the same spectrum and very similar analytic form but

dier from each other for the nature and the number of the elementary excitations (see

table 2). in this paper we used the scattering description based on the z2 symmetry which
characterises the rsos models. the massive dilute q-state potts model at t = tc [12, 36]
has q+1 degenerate vacua located at the q vertices and at the center of a hypertetrahedron
living in the (q  1)-dimensional space of the independent order parameter components.
the elementary excitations are the 2q kinks interpolating from the center to the vertices,

and vice versa (fig. 8). in the massive phase of the o(n) model there is a single vacuum

and the elementary excitations are n ordinary particles transforming according to the

vector representation of the group [13, 14]. of course, for non-integer values of q and n

the number of excitations is also non-integer, but this is not more surprising than the

appearence of operators with non-integer multiplicity in the modular invariant partition

functions for the two models at criticality (see [35]).

the dierent number of excitations for a given p ensures that there is no one to one

correspondence between the three scattering descriptions, although some connections cer-
tainly exists7. for each particle basis the asymptotic states have obvious transformation

properties under the relevant symmetry group and this fact allows a natural identica-

tion within the form factor approach of the interesting operators (for example the order

parameter).

as was discussed above, no matter which particle basis is used, summation over the

intermediate asymptotic states must lead to the same result for the correlation functions
of some invariant operators, in particular the trace of the stress-energy tensor (x) 
1,3(x). since each n-particle contribution to the spectral sum has a distinct large
distance behaviour exp(nmr), the identication is expected to occur term by term. it
is easy to check comparing the results of this paper with those of refs. [12, 14] that this
is indeed the case for the rst (two-particle) contribution to h(x)(0)i.

7a relation between the rsos and dilute potts scattering theory for p = 6 was pointed out in [36].

the issue of the relation between the o(n) and rsos scattering descriptions has been discussed in [37]

from the point of view of quantum group reduction of sine-gordon model.

13

most of the considerations of this section can be extended to the case of the more

general action (5.1).
