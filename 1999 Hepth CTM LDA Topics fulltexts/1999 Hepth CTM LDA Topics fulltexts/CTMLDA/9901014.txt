(2.12) massless states gravity multiplet cartan subalgebra nl = 1 pl = pr = 0. additional massless gauge bosons would nl = 0, therefore p2 l = 2. wi = 0 i, requires v 2 = 2 pi = 0. possible choices v simply roots so(32), easy see root least one k half-integer; thus pi zz + 1/2 cannot vanish, state inner products v kai massive. hand, wi 6= 0 least one i, requires (v + aw)2 < 2, follows v + aw = 0, i.e. massless gauge particle charged cartan subalgebra so(32). 3 bps states order test identication further, useful relate perturbative bps states heterotic string d-brane states iia 4/zz2, compare masses. let us start simplest case bulk d-particle. state charged 5 bulk u(1) corresponding ten-dimensional rr one-form c (1) rr. described boundary state iia |d0; 1 >= 1 2(cid:16)|u0 >n sn +1|u0 >rr (cid:17) , (3.1) two components dened standard way {$9803194$}, lie untwisted nsns rr sectors, respectively. 1 = 1 dierentiates d-particle anti- d-particle. suitable normalisation two components open-closed consistency condition satised , spectrum open strings beginning one d-particle ending another given  1 2(cid:16)1 + 1 1(1)f(cid:17) . (3.2) corresponding state heterotic string trivial winding (wi = 0) momentum (v = 0, pi = 0), except p4 = 1. level matching requires nl = 1, therefore state really kaluza-klein excitation either gravity multiplet one vector multiplets cartan subalgebra. mass given (2.12) mh(d0) = 1 rh4 . (3.3) corresponding mass type iia found using (2.6) (2.7), turns ma(d0) = v 1/2 h ghmh(d0) = 1 ga . (3.4) complete agreement mass d-particle. next consider d-particle stuck one xed planes. mass bulk rr charge half bulk d-particle (since prior projection corresponds single d-particle, whereas bulk d-particle corresponds two d- particles); therefore called fractional d-particle {$9808141$}. also carries unit charge respect twisted rr u(1) xed plane. corresponding boundary state form |d0f ; 1, 2 >= 1 2(cid:20)(cid:16)|u0 >n sn +1|u0 >rr (cid:17) + 2(cid:16)|t 0 >n sn +1|t 0 >rr (cid:17)(cid:21) , (3.5) |u0 >n sn |u0 >rr states appeared (3.1), |t 0 >n sn |t 0 >rr lie twisted nsns twisted rr sectors, respectively. 1 = 1 12 = 1 determine sign bulk twisted charges state, respectively. using standard techniques  easy see components invariant 6 gso orbifold projections, suitable normalisation twisted components open-closed consistency condition satised. indeed, spectrum open strings beginning one fractional d-particle ending another given  1 4(cid:16)1 + 1 1(1)f(cid:17)(cid:16)1 + 2 2i4(cid:17) . (3.6) blow orbifold smooth k3, fractional d-particle corresponds d2-brane wraps supersymmetric cycle {$9806155$}. orbifold limit area cycle vanishes, corresponding state massless, since two-form eld b(2) non-vanishing integral around cycle {$9809111$}. fact b = 1/2, resulting state carries one unit twisted charge coming membrane itself, one half unit bulk charge coming d2-brane world-volume action term r d3 c (1) rr (f (2) + b(2)). xed point four states, corresponding two possible orientations membrane, possibility f = 0 f = 1 (as f must integral, state always non-vanishing bulk charge). four possible fractional d-particles (3.5). since sixteen orbifold xed planes, total 64 states. heterotic string correspond states internal weight vectors form v = (02n, 1,1, 0142n) (n = 1, . . . , 8) , (3.7) vanishing winding internal momentum, except p4 = 1/2. sixteen twisted u(1) charges iia picture correspond symmetric anti-symmetric combinations (2n + 1)st (2n + 2)nd cartan u(1) charges heterotic picture. follows heterotic mass formula (2.12) mass states mh(d0f ) = 1 2rh4 . before, corresponds mass ma(d0f ) = v 1/2 h gh mh(d0f ) = 1 2ga , (3.8) (3.9) orbifold type iia, thus complete agreement mass fractional d-particle. additional bps states obtained wrapping d2-branes around non-vanishing su- persymmetric 2-cycles, wrapping d4-branes around entire compact space. one compute mass states, thus nd corresponding state heterotic string. let us briey summarise results: 7 (i) d2-brane wraps cycle (xi, xj) 6= j i, j {1, 2, 3} mass = rairaj/(2ga); heterotic units corresponds mh = 2rhk, k {1, 2, 3} equal either j. corresponding heterotic state wk = 1, pl = 0, (v ak)2 = 2, nl = 0. (ii) d2-brane wraps cycle (xi, x4), either 1, 2 3, mass = raira4/(2ga); heterotic units corresponds mh = 1/(2rhi). corresponding heterotic state therefore pi = 1/2, wj = 0, v 2 = 2, nl = 0. (iii) d4-brane wrapping entire compact space mass = qi rai/(2ga); het- erotic units corresponds mh = 2rh4. corresponding heterotic state therefore w4 = 1, pl = 0, (v a4)2 = 2, nl = 0. 4 non-bps states heterotic string also contains non-bps states stable certain domains moduli space. one therefore expect states also seen dual type iia theory, correspond non-bps branes. course, since non-bps states protected supersymmetry quantum corrections mass, analysis hold gh 1 ga 1 heterotic type iia theory, respectively. 4.1 non-bps d-string simplest examples kind heterotic states vanishing winding momenta (wi = pi = 0), weight vectors given v = (0m,2, 015m) v = (02m,1,1, 02n,1,1, 0122n2m) . (4.1) results previous section indicate states charged precisely two u(1)s associated two xed points iia, uncharged respect u(1)s. four states pair u(1)s, carrying 1 charges respect two u(1)s. cases v 2 = 4, must choose nr = cr + 1 satisfy level-matching. states therefore bps, transform long multiplets = 6 n = (1, 1) supersymmetry algebra. mass given mh = 22 , (4.2) follows (2.12); particular, mass independent radii. 8 hand, states carry charges two bps states form discussed previous section (where charge respect spacetime u(1)s chosen opposite two states), might therefore decay them. whether decay occurs depends values radii, since masses bps states depend them. particular, rst state (4.1) carries charges two bps states p4 = 1/2, weight vectors form v1 = (02n, 1, 1, 0142n) v2 = (02n, 1,1, 0142n) , (4.3) n = . mass states 1/(2rh4), decay therefore energetically forbidden rh4 < . (4.4) 1 22 generally, non-bps state charges two bps states wi = 0, internal weight vectors v1 = (cid:16)0m, 1, 0k, 1, 014mk(cid:17) v2 = (cid:16)0m, 1, 0k,1, 014mk(cid:17) , (4.5) non-vanishing internal momenta chosen opposite two states. lightest states form single non-vanishing momentum, pi = 1/2 one = 1, 2, 3, 4, mass 1/(2rhi). provided rhi < 1 22 = 1, 2, 3, 4 , (4.6) non-bps state cannot decay pairs bps states, therefore stable. similar statements also hold non-bps states second kind (4.1). therefore expect iia theory possesses non-bps d-brane appropriate charges multiplicities. state easily constructed: non-bps d-string type iia, whose boundary state given |d1nonbps; , >= 1 2(cid:20)|u1; >n sn + 2 (cid:16)|t 1; 1 >rr +ei|t 2; 2 >rr(cid:17)(cid:21) , (4.7) used notation sen .3 value wilson line d-string, must 0 orbifold, = 1. two states twisted rr sector localised either end d-string (so d-string stretches 3this state also independently constructed sen {$9803194$}. 9 1  4 (cid:16)1 + (1)fi4(cid:17)(cid:16)1 + (1)fi 4(cid:17) , (4.8) two orbifold points). using standard techniques , one easily check boundary components invariant gso orbifold projections, and, suitable normalisation dierent components, open-closed consistency condition satised. spectrum open strings beginning ending d-string obtained usual computing cylinder amplitude boundary state, result 4 i4, except acts x4 x4 2ra4 x4. pair orbifold points four d-strings, charged two twisted sector u(1)s associated two orbifold points. charges magnitude fractional d-particles, since ground state |t 1 >rr |t 0 >rr (3.5). furthermore, follows (4.8) d-strings sixteen (rather eight) fermionic zero modes, therefore transform long multiplets = 6, n = (1, 1) supersymmetry algebra. states therefore exactly correct properties correspond non-bps states heterotic theory. not, however, expect corresponding masses related duality map, since non-bps states masses protected quantum corrections. let us consider example case d-string suspended two orbifold points separated along x4 (fig. 1a). classical mass given ma(d1nonbps) = ra42ga . (4.9) numerical factor determined comparing boundary state non-bps d-string (4.7) bps d-string two xed planes (t-dual) type iib orbifold (eq. (3.16) ). units two orbifold theories simply related replacing ga gb, since coecient untwisted nsns component greater factor 2 non-bps d-string, mass given (4.9). heterotic units, mass 1/vh, therefore agree (4.2). open string ns sector (4.8) contains tachyon. however, since tachyon (1)f -odd, since i4 reverses sign momentum along d-string, zero- momentum component tachyon eld d-string projected out. furthermore, 4 acts x4 x4 2ra4, half-odd-integer momentum components also since i4i removed, leaving lowest mode unit momentum. consequence, mass tachyon shifted (4.10) ra4 < 2 tachyon actually massive, thus attains vacuum value origin. hand, ra4 > 2 tachyon non-zero vacuum expectation value, + m2 = 1 2 1 r2 a4 . 10 lowest momentum mode describes kink-anti-kink conguration along d-string, tachyon eld vanishes two endpoints d-string, approaches vacuum value in-between. ra4 > 2 state therefore appropriately described pair fractional bps d-particles located either xed point, carrying opposite bulk charges (fig. 1b). alternatively, ground state ns sector open string two fractional bps d-particles mass 1 2 2 , m2 = + (ra4t0)2 = (4.11) becomes tachyonic ra4 < 2, indicating instability decay non-bps d-string. d-string therefore thought bound state two fractional bps d- particles located dierent xed planes. also conrmed fact classical mass d-string (4.9) smaller two fractional d-particles (3.9) 1 2 +(cid:18)ra4 2 (cid:19) ra4 < 2 , (4.12) thus d-string stable decay two fractional d-particles regime. terms heterotic string, decay channel corresponds (4.3). regimes stability non-bps state two dual theories, (4.4) (4.12), qualitatively same, given duality relation (2.6). ra4 rai +- +- +- (1/2, ) b +- (-1/2, ) c figure 1: non-bps d-string (a), decay channels (b),(c). decay channels become available d-string distances rai particular, d-string along x4 decay pair (i = 1, 2, 3) become small. d2-branes carrying opposite bulk charges, i.e. d2-brane anti-d2-brane, wrap- ping (xi, x4) cycle (fig. 1c). since mass d2-brane orbifold metric raira4/(2ga), d-string stable channel rai > 1 2 (i = 1, 2, 3) . 11 (4.13) d-string therefore also thought bound state two bps d2-branes. decay channel also understood appearance tachyon d-string carrying one unit winding xi direction, rai < 1/2 {$9803194$}, alternatively appearance tachyon two d2-branes rai > 1/2. terms heterotic string, decay channels described (4.5), domains stability qualitatively same. analogous regimes stability d-strings stretched two xed points. blow orbifold smooth k3, non-bps d-strings correspond membranes wrapping pairs shrinking 2-cycles. since curves holomorphic representatives, states non-bps. pair 2-cycles four states, asso- ciated dierent orientations membrane; membrane wrap cycles orientation, opposite orientation. either case net bulk charge due b = 1/2 made vanish turning appropriate world-volume gauge eld strength (f = 1 rst case, f = 0 second). decay non-bps d-string pair fractional bps d-particles described picture decay membrane two separate membranes, wrap individually around two 2-cycles. entire discussion also parallel t-dual theory, type iib 4/zz 2. fractional bps d-particles t-dual bps d-strings stretched pairs orb- ifold points, non-bps d-string found t-dual non-bps d-particle constructed {$9806155$}. demonstrated sen , state obtained bound state two fractional bps d-strings carrying opposite bulk charges, appropriate twisted charges. suciently large rb, d-string pair develops tachyonic mode decays non-bps d-particle. 4.2 non-bps d-molecule heterotic theory also contains states charged single u(1) associated one xed plane iia orbifold, uncharged respect u(1). lightest states nl = 0 internal weight vector form v = (02n, 2,2, 0142n) . (4.14) since v 2 = 8, must choose nr = cr + 3 satisfy level matching. state therefore non-bps4 mass given mh = 26 . (4.15) state may decay two bps states form (3.7), two non-bps states form (4.1). latter possibility energetically forbidden since 2 22 > 26, 4the degeneracy state rather large, actually contains 60 long supermultiplets. 12 former possible provided rh4 > 1/(26). heterotic theory, non-bps state therefore stable 5 rh4 < . (4.16) 1 26 suggests dual type iia theory contains bound state two fractional d-particles located xed plane, carry opposite bulk charges. previous subsection saw bound state two fractional d-particles opposite bulk charge located dierent xed planes could better described non-bps d-string. let us therefore attempt describe state non-bps d-particle xed plane. associated boundary state would given |d0nonbps; >= c(cid:16)|u0 >n sn |t 0 >rr (cid:17) , |u0 >n sn |t 0 >rr states (3.5), c normalisation factor determined below. resulting spectrum open strings beginning ending d-particle given (4.17) (4.18)  c2(cid:16)1 + (1)fi4(cid:17) . order make sense spectrum actual open string theory, nor- malisation c = 1/2. hand, magnitude twisted charge (4.17) would 2 units twisted charge associated fractional bps d- particles (3.5).6 furthermore, spectrum open strings non-bps d-particle fractional bps d-particle above, except overall factor c/2 rather c2. make sense need c = 1, rather c = 1/2. normalisation, charge (and mass) (4.17) precisely twice twisted charge fractional bps d-particle, state described (4.17) stable. consistent fact open string spectrum doubled, therefore cannot describe open string begins ends single d-particle. situation also dierent case non-bps d-string pair fractional bps d-particles carry opposite bulk charges equal twisted charges exhibit tachyonic instability, follows (3.6). hand, one expect two fractional d-particles bind, since interaction form v (r) = r7 + b r3 , a, b > 0 , rst term ten-dimensional (bulk) contribution, second term six-dimensional (twisted) contribution. unlike case two bps d-particles dierent 5we considering possible decay processes states trivial winding number. 6 thank a. sen pointing out. 13 xed planes, bound state correspond new d-brane; appropriately referred d-molecule. d-molecule carries two units twisted charge, bulk charge, therefore still restricted xed plane. (this contrasted (threshold) bound state two fractional bps d-particles carrying equal bulk charges opposite twisted charges, corresponds bulk bps d-particle). since interaction comes one loop open string diagram, o(ga). weak coupling mass d-molecule therefore well approximated mass two fractional d-particles, i.e. 1/ga. decay channels described heterotic string correspond iia decay d-molecule pair fractional bps d-particles pair non-bps d-strings. former energetically forbidden. hand, mass two non-bps d-strings 2rai/ga, therefore smaller d-molecule rai < 1/2. d-molecule thus stable type iia theory rai > 1/2. unlike non-bps d-string, stability domains d-molecule qualitatively dierent two theories, i.e. weak strong iia coupling. weak iia coupling decay non-bps states possible, whereas strong iia coupling, decay bps states allowed. coupling varied weak strong, energy levels must therefore cross over, expect intermediate coupling, decay channels available. blow smooth k3 d-molecule corresponds two d2-branes wrapping shrinking 2-cycle. world-volume gauge eld must f = 1 one membranes, cancel bulk charge due b = 1/2 2-cycle. (conditional) stability particle implies two wrapped d2-branes form (non-threshold) bound state non-vanishing region moduli space. 4.3 non-bps states exist also non-bps states heterotic string stable certain regions moduli space, states transforming spinor representation so(32), e.g. v = ((1/2)16). = 10 state identied zz2-valued non-bps d-particle dual type string . going sequence duality transformations (2.1) suggests following interpretation state: four t-dualities d- particle becomes non-bps d4-brane iib 4/zz 2. s-duality transforms non-bps (non-dirichlet) 4-brane. nal t-duality gives non-bps 4-brane iia 4/zz2. like type d-particle, 4-brane zz2-valued. perhaps 4-brane understood bound state ns-5-brane anti-ns-5-brane, analogy d-brane case. however, yet clear analogue tachyon condensation would be. 14 5 conclusions paper analysed duality heterotic string 4 type iia string k3 states necessarily bps. particular, type iia string theory 4/zz2, orbifold limit k3, admits non-bps d-string well non- bps d-molecule, related duality map perturbative non-bps states heterotic string, therefore probe duality beyond regime bps states. d-string also related t-duality non-bps d-particle related orbifold type iib string theory, constructed {$9806155$}. states stable everywhere moduli space. determined regions stability heterotic type iia pictures, found regions non-vanishing size cases. case non-bps d-string, regions stability also qualitatively related duality map. since masses non-bps states protected supersymmetry, guaranteed priori. would interesting understand branes terms k-theoretic framework proposed witten {$9803194$}. generally, would interesting analyse systematically various non-bps dirichlet-branes orbifolds orientifolds type ii theories, relate k-theory predictions. acknowledgements would like thank mina aganagic, eric gimon, joe minahan useful conversa- tions, ashoke sen pointing error earlier version. o.b. supported part doe grant no. de-fg03-92-er 40701. m.r.g. supported college lectureship fitzwilliam college, cambridge.
