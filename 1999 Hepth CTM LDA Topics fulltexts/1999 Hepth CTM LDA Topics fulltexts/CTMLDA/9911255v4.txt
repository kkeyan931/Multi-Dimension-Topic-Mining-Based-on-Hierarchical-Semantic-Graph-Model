abstract

we discuss the general issues and ambiguities involved in matching the exact results for
the low energy eective action of scale invariant n = 2 supersymmetric qcd to those
obtained by instanton methods. we resolve the reported disagreements and verify
agreement between an innite series of coecients in the low energy eective actions
calculated in the two approaches. in particular, we show that the exact low-energy
eective couplings for su(n) for all n with 2n fundamental hypermultiplets agree
at a special vacuum on the coulomb branch where a large unbroken discrete global
symmetry makes the matching of parameters relatively straightforward.

1 introduction

following [1, 2], the exact low energy eective actions on the coulomb branches of
many n = 2 gauge theories have been deduced. the basic method used is typically a
kind of analytic continuation, where the constraints of rigid special kahler geometry,
matching onto various weak coupling limits, and matching onto the strongly coupled
su(2) yang-mills solution of [1], combine to determine the exact non-perturbative
contributions to the low energy eective action for ranges of parameters where the
microscopic theory is strongly coupled.

alternatively, one may calculate these non-perturbative contributions directly using
semi-classical instanton techniques. the expansion in instanton number provides a
power series expansion of the couplings of the low energy eective theory around weak
coupling which should match that of the exact solution. such a program has been
carried out for scale-invariant su(n) theories in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] where disagreements
with the exact solutions were reported.

in this paper we will resolve these conicts, and perform an innite series of checks
relating the two approaches. we note that the purpose of this paper is to show how to
systematically compare the predictions of any two proposed solutions of a given n = 2
theory, but not to discuss how to derive a given solution. in particular, an n = 2 qcd
solution must satisfy an intricate web of consistency requirements following from the
interrelations of the given theory with other theories with dierent numbers of colors or
avors; this paper is silent about these consistency requirements, eectively assuming
that the solutions under examination have already met them.

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section we discuss the general issues
involved in comparing the exact solutions to the results of instanton calculations. the
central point is the freedom to make non-perturbative redenitions of the parameters
and vacuum expectation values that enter into the low energy eective action. this
freedom was pointed out in [9, 10] in comparing dierent expressions for the eective
actions of the scale-invariant n = 2 su(3) theory, and has been used in discussions
comparing the semi-classical and exact solutions, resolving the above-mentioned dis-
agreements for n = 2 su(2) qcd, and partially resolving the disagreements for n = 2
su(n) qcd [3, 5, 6, 11, 12]. we extend and clarify these treatments by making a
systematic analysis of the full set of allowed non-perturbative redenitions.

in section 3 we illustrate the use of this freedom in the n = 4 su(2) model broken
to n = 2 by an adjoint hypermultiplet mass, to resolve the mismatch reported in
[7]. in this case there are, however, no non-trivial checks of the exact result using only

1

the one-instanton result.

in section 4 we turn to the scale invariant n = 2 supersymmetric su(n) theories
with 2n fundamental avors. we rst apply our general matching requirements to show
the equivalence of the various exact solutions for su(n) with 2n avors proposed in
[13, 14, 15], about which there seems to be some doubt in the literature.

then in section 5 we resolve the conicts reported in [8] for these theories. in this
case there are in principle many non-trivial checks that can be performed for each n
even at the one-instanton level; we verify an innite sub-series of these checks.
in
particular we show that the one-instanton results and exact methods agree for all n
at a special point in the moduli space of vacua.

2 comparing curves and instantons

in comparing two solutions for the low energy eective actions of any theory, it is
necessary to identify the most general map between the parameters and vacuum ex-
pectation values (vevs) entering into the two solutions consistent with dimensional
analysis, global symmetries, and the meaning of parameters versus vevs in the low
energy theory. in the supersymmetric case this matching of parameters is also con-
strained by various supersymmetric selection rules which in the n = 2 cases discussed
here imply the holomorphic dependence of certain low-energy eective couplings on
parameters in the theory.

the low energy eective action on the coulomb branch of a scale-invariant n = 2
su(n) theorythe specic focus of this paperdepends on a complex gauge coupling
constant q, complex bare mass parameters m, and complex vevs uk. let us start by
reviewing the denitions of these variables.

gauge coupling. in scale-invariant theories the complex gauge coupling  = (/2)+
i(4/g2) is an exactly marginal parameter of the microscopic (high-energy) theory.
because of the angularity of the theta angle (invariance of the theory under integer
shifts of  ) it is convenient to parameterize the theory by q  e2i , for which weak
coupling corresponds to q = 0.

masses. other parameters entering into the microscopic lagrangian are the complex
bare masses of hypermultiplet elds. in terms of n = 1 superelds, a hypermultiplet
in the fundamental representation of su(n) can be described by two chiral multiplets,
q and eq transforming in the n and n, respectively. the complex mass parameter m

enters as the superpotential coupling

l  mz d2 trqeq + c.c. .

(1)

vevs. unlike q and m, vevs are not parameters in the microscopic lagrangian, but
instead are coordinates on the moduli space of vacua of the low-energy eective action.
on the coulomb branch, the gauge group is generically broken to u(1)n 1, and the
vacua form an n  1 complex-dimensional space coordinatized by the gauge invariant
combinations of the vevs va, a = 1, . . . , n, of the adjoint scalar eld component v of
the n = 2 vector supereld v . classically (at weak coupling), writing v as a traceless
complex n  n matrix in the gauge indices, the at directions have (up to gauge
rotations) diagonal vevs with entries va

hvi = diag{v1, . . . , vn},

(2)

satisfying the tracelessness conditionpn

a=1 va = 0. a subgroup of the gauge group acts
by permutations on the va, so a basis of gauge invariant coordinates (at least near weak
coupling) on the coulomb branch can be taken to be the symmetric polynomials

uk = ()k xa1<...<ak+1

va1    vak+1,

(3)

for k = 1, . . . , n  1. note that by the tracelessness condition u0  0. (indices from
the beginning of the alphabet (a, b, c, d) run from 1 to n, while those from the middle
(j, k, , m) will run from 1 to n  1 throughout this paper.)

the above denitions only pin down what is meant by q, m, and uk at weak coupling,
since they only refer to how these parameters appear in the classical (weak coupling)
lagrangian, or the relation of the uks to vevs of a eld computed by the classical
higgs mechanism. the essential point to bear in mind in matching to the exact so-
lutions found by the analytic continuation methods pioneered in [1, 2] is that the
above weak-coupling properties of the parameters and vevs are all that is used to dene

them. thus any two quantities, say vevs uk and euk, that at weak coupling satisfy the

dening relation (3) but dier by higher-order perturbative or non-perturbative contri-
butions, are equally valid candidates to be the vevs entering in the exact solution. in
particular, the parameters and vevs of the exact solution can and therefore generically
will dier by such higher-order contributions from the parameters and vevs dened in
any specic calculational scheme (such as the dr scheme [16] used in supersymmetric
instanton computations [17, 18]).

3

there are, of course, some restrictions on this anything that can happen, will
principle. first, the parameters and vevs must satisfy selection rules arising from global
symmetries (perhaps explicitly or spontaneously broken) of the theory. for example,
there is a global u(1)r symmetry in the scale invariant models that we are considering
in this paper, under which the vas and m all have the same charge. thus the uk
have charge k + 1 under this spontaneously broken symmetry, and any redenition of
the uks must preserve these charge assignments. also, the selection rules arising from
the unbroken global supersymmetry imply that q, m, and uk all must enter the low-
energy eective action holomorphically, and so only holomorphic redenitions of these
parameters are allowed. a perhaps less obvious restriction arises from the distinction
between parameters and vevs in eld theories: since for a given set of parameters there
is a whole moduli space of vacua, one cannot modify the denition of a parameter (q
or m) by making it dependent on the vevs (uk), though it is allowed to do the reverse.
even with these restrictions there is a large family of allowed redenitions of the
parameters and vevs of the theory. we can be fairly explicit about the form of this
family. consider two descriptions of the theory, one with parameters q, m, and vevs

morphically and by its weak coupling denition, must be asymptotically proportional

uk, and the other with eq, fm, and euk.
couplings. as eq is a parameter it can only depend on q and m, but since it is
dimensionless it cannot depend on m. by supersymmetry eq must depend on q holo-
to q as q  0. the general relation between eq and q is then
eq = c0q + c1q2 + c2q3 +   

(4)

for some complex numbers cn. thus, what is meant by the complex coupling in the
exact low-energy eective actions of n = 2 gauge theories is only determined up to the
innite series of constants cn. the coecient c0 has the form of a one-loop threshold
contribution (a shift of 1/g2), while the cn for n  1 correspond to non-perturbative
(instanton) modications of the coupling.

there are two further points worth remarking on in connection with (4). the rst
has to do with cases where there are more than one mass parameter, say m1 and m2.
one can then form a holomorphic dimensionless ratio of these masses, m1/m2, which
one might think will enter into the matching (4). however, this cannot happen since
then there would be a limit in the space of theories where the weak-coupling equivalence

for any xed m1/m2 is an allowed redenition of the coupling, but fails in the corner of

of q and eq would fail. an example to make the point clear is eq = q + (m1/m2)q2, which
parameter space where m1/m2   as q2 since it violates the weak-coupling eq  q

4

requirement.

the second point has to do with global identications, or s-dualities, on the space
of couplings. the redenition (4) need not preserve any nice s-duality action on the
couplings, for though covariance under s-duality transformations might be convenient,
it is not a physical requirement for any description of a theory; the physically mean-
ingful notions are the topology and complex structure of the space of couplings which
are invariant under analytic reparametrizations [19].

masses. the parameter fm can only depend holomorphically on q and m, and by

dimensional considerations and agreement with its weak-coupling denition we have

fm = (1 + b1q + b2q2 +   )m.

(5)

if there is more than one mass parameter, then they may mix at higher orders in q
consistent with any global avor symmetries.

vevs. the euk can depend on uk, q, and m holomorphically, and should preserve

u(1)r charge assignments and their weak-coupling denitions:

note that for similar reasons that ratios of masses could not appear in (4), ratios of
masses or vevs do not appear in (6).

finally, we can remove a small part of this ambiguity by dimensional analysis. so
far we have not specied any scale in either of our two descriptions of the theory, so we
have the freedom to equate, by at, any pair of variables of the same dimension (and

5

consistent with the symmetries) to dene how scales in one description of the theory
are related to scales in the other. in section 5 we will nd it convenient to use this

freedom to set eun 1 = un 1 in the last equation of (6)i.e., set a(n 1;)
the general matching formulas (46) are the main result of this section. their co-
ecients represent an inherent ambiguity in any prediction derived from the exact
low-energy eective action of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory. in the next two
sections we will describe two very simple examples of how the use of these matching
relations resolves some apparent contradictions or ambiguities reported in the litera-
ture.

3 comparing curves and instantons in su(2) with

massive adjoint matter

in the one-instanton analysis of su(2) with a massive adjoint hypermultiplet given in
[7], a mismatch with the exact curve of [2] is reported. the authors of [7] determine
the one instanton correction to the position in the u1-plane where a component of the
hypermultiplet becomes massless. (here u1 = u in the notation of [7].) they nd the
singularity occurs at

u1 =

the resolution of this discrepancy is obvious in light of our matching relations (46):

those entering the semi-classical analysis. (note that in (9) eu1 = u in the notation of
[2], and is not the eu variable of that paper!)
what is being computed is the relation between theeu1 variable used in the exact solution

(11)

this gives a restriction on the change of variables needed to match the curve to the
instanton results, but does not aect any physical predictions. one needs to compute
two-instanton corrections in this theory before one can make a physical check of the
two approaches, as noted in [7].

4 comparing dierent curves for su(n) with 2n

avors

the main computation of this paper, in section 5, will be an example checking that
the physical predictions (after xing the relations between variables) of the exact curve
and of the one-instanton computations match. the theories for which we do this are
the scale-invariant su(n) theories with 2n avors of massless fundamental hypermul-
tiplets.

we will use the exact curve in the form

y2 = xn 

n 1xk=1 eukxn k1!2

eq

2nyr=1 x + fmr2! .

(12)

as this form of the curve does not quite correspond to any of the forms [13, 14, 15]
appearing in the literature, and also since some uncertainty about the equivalence of
these curves has been expressed [8], in this section we will show that all these forms
are equivalent to (12).

we start with the form of the curve derived in [13]:

y2 = xn 

n 1xk=1

ukxn k1!2

 (1  g2)

2nyr=1
(x + (g  1) + mr).

here   (1/2n)pr mr and g is some function of the coupling which has the expansion

(13)

(14)

g(q) = 1  2q + o(q2)

near weak coupling. it is clear that dening

eq = 1  g2 = 4q + o(q2),
fmr/2 = mr + (g  1) = mr 
euk = uk,

makes (13) and (12) equivalent. since these relations are of the form of the allowed re-
denitions of variables we derived in section 2, this then shows the physical equivalence
of these curves.1

we now turn to the form of the curve described in [14]:

ey2 = exn

if we rescale the uk by  and shift by (l/4)tk+1, rescale the masses by , and dene

becomes of the form (12) except for two minor discrepancies: in the squared term on

eq = l, (all of which are allowed redenitions by our previous discussion) then (16)
the right hand side there is an exn 1 term with coecient (l/4)t1  qmr and the exn
term has coecient 1 + (l/4)  1 + o(q). these discrepancies can be removed by a
shift of the (dummy) ex variable by  lmr and a rescaling of ey by 1 + (l/4). these
then require shifts and rescalings of the coupling, masses, and vevs, but since the shifts
are all o(q) and the rescalings are  1 + o(q), they are also allowed redenitions of
our variables. explicitly, the change of variables

we now come to the main calculation of this paper, where we resolve the diculty,
reported in [8], with matching a one-instanton calculation to the exact curve for the
scale-invariant 2n avor su(n) theory.

the authors of [8] proposed to relate the coupling parameter e of the curve (12)
to the low energy matrix of eective couplings e jk at a special vacuum in the moduli

for su(n) with n > 3 it can be proven [10, 20] that e jk is not proportional to  jk
the rst point to make towards resolving this diculty is to note that e is the
general to satisfy any simple relation to the matrix of low-energy couplings e jk. the

low-energy coupling is some function of the microscopic coupling parameter and the
vevs. the instanton methods also calculate these low-energy coupling functions as an
expansion in q:

the n-instanton contributions; all the  jk
n are functions of the vevs. the proper way
to compare the results of the two methods is to compare their predictions for the
matrix of low-energy couplings as functions of the coupling and the vevs modulo the
allowed redenitions (4) and (6) of the variables. (note that here we are setting all
mass parameters to zero.) there is also the inherent ambiguity in the denition of the
low-energy couplings themselves by electric-magnetic duality transformations, which
must also be taken into account; we will encounter examples of this below.

to compare the physical predictions of the exact and instanton methods, we must
relate the parameter and vevs on the two sides. on the exact side, we use the variables

eq andeuk, while on the instanton side, we use q and uk. (in general, quantities associated

with the exact solutions will have tildes, those in the instanton calculations, not.) the
technical problem of how to carry out this matching in practice remains, and might
seem dicult in light of the large number of undetermined coecients in the matching
relations (6). however, we can use the following simple trick to organize the comparison
of the two methods: we expand about a special direction in the moduli space where the
u(1)r symmetry is partly restored to a zn symmetry and makes the matching in (6)
unambiguous. in particular, along the line u1 = u2 = . . . = un 2 = 0 in the coulomb
branch (with m = 0), (6) implies simply

euk = uk = 0,
eun 1 = un 1.

k = 1, . . . , n  2,

here we have used our freedom to set dimensionful scales to equate eun 1 and un 1

do indeed agree.

theory, which we have suppressed. this will be discussed below.

5.2 the electric-magnetic duality ambiguity

dierent choices of canonical homology bases translate into dierent  jk related by

  (a + b)(c + d)1

(40)

where(cid:16)a b

c d(cid:17)  sp(2n 2, z) for (n 1)(n 1) integer matrices a, b, c, and d. this is

an electric-magnetic duality transformation on the low-energy u(1)n 1 couplings, and
is an inherent ambiguity in the meaning of those couplings: any two  jk related by (40)
are physically equivalent. in comparing the  jks predicted by the curve and instanton
methods, the possibility that they dier by such an sp(2n  2, z) transformation must
be taken into account.

this is only a discrete ambiguity, however, since sp(2n  2, z) is a discrete group.
in particular, the entries in(cid:16)a b
c d(cid:17) are integers and therefore q and uk independent. thus
it suces to determine this matrix at one vacuum (the special vacuum, in our case).
in the case at hand, we have chosen our canonical basis of cycles {j, k} so that
the leading (classical) term in the low-energy matches with the semi-classical result:
the coecient of (ln q)/(2i) in both cases is  jk
cl = 1 + jk. we can ask, given this
agreement, what electric-magnetic duality ambiguity remains? consider two weak-
coupling expansions of the low-energy ij of the form (25) with coecients  jk
n and b jk
n .
then the condition that they be related by an sp(2n  2, z) transformation of the
form (40) for arbitrary (weak) coupling q implies that c = 0 and

acl = cld,

n  1,

(41)

is understood. the rst thing to note is that b, which corresponds to constant shifts of
the  jk, is determined at the one-loop level; we will determine it below. secondly, the

where we are treating  and b as (n  1) (n  1) matrices, and matrix multiplication
condition that (cid:16)a b
0 d(cid:17)  sp(2n  2, z) implies that d = (at )1, so the only remaining

ab0 + b = 0d,
abn = nd,

14

ambiguity lies in the choice of a  sl(n  1, z) which satises

aclat = cl.

(42)

we can determine the possible a satisfying (42) as follows. think of a as a matrix
mapping the lattice of integer (n1)-vectors to itself. (42) implies that a also preserves
the metric cl on this space. but with this metric, the minimum non-zero length-
squared of an integer vector is 2, given by vectors of the form ej or ej  ek where ej
is the vector with a 1 in the jth position and zeros elsewhere. so a must map the basis
{ei} to another basis made up of ej and/or ej  ek. up to a permutation matrix,
such a matrix must be of the triangular form

a =

...

where the upper triangular entries are either 0 or 1 with at most one non-zero o-
diagonal entry in each column, of opposite sign to the diagonal entry in that column.
the general form for a is then

a = p1ap2,

(44)

for p1,2 arbitrary permutation matrices.

it so happens that the matching at the special vacuum using the canonical basis of
fig. 1, which we perform below, works for a = 1, so we do not have to exercise the
option of more complicated electric-magnetic duality transformations with a 6= 1. we
will see, however, that we will have to use our freedom to do integer shifts of  jk, which
correspond to electric-magnetic duality transformations with b 6= 0.

5.3 one-loop threshold computation

the one-loop correction is a threshold correction, i.e., a renormalization scheme de-
pendent dierence between the gauge couplings in the high energy theory and those in
the low energy eective theory. such threshold corrections were calculated in [21] in
a dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction scheme, and were converted to
the dr scheme in [22], giving the result

fermions, and real scalars. since a massive n = 2 vector multiplet has one massive
vector eld, one dirac fermion eld, and one real scalar eld, all in the adjoint repre-
sentation, while our 2n massive hypermultiplets each have a dirac fermion and four
real scalars, all in the fundamental representation, we get

a similarly as nn matrices acting on the n-dimensional

the vector multiplet mass matrix, by the usual higgs mechanism, is read o from

the kinetic term for v, giving

tr(cid:16)[a,hvi] [a,hvi](cid:17) = |va  vb|2 (a)a

(48)

implying that the diagonal as are massless, and the o-diagonal as have mass |vavb|,
giving the mass matrix

|mv |ac

(49)

the masses for the accompanying massive real scalar and dirac fermion in the n = 2
vector multiplet are the same by supersymmetry. the hypermultiplet masses arise
from the superpotential term [23]

l 

2z d2 tr(qveq) + c.c. .

16

(50)

replacing v by its vev generates a mass term for the hypermultiplets which, comparing
to the bare mass term (1), implies the hypermultiplet mass matrix

|mh|a

b = 2|va| a

b .

(51)

these are the masses for the four real scalars as well as the dirac fermion in the massive
hypermultiplet.

ln|va  vc|  n ln|

2va|  (1  ab) ln|va  vb| ,

(52)

where we have used  ab  (ab/2) + i(4/g2

ab).

to translate this to the su(n)  u(1)n 1 couplings, we remove the trace piece to

make the (n  1)  (n  1) matrix of low-energy couplings

 jk
0 =  jk   jn   n k +  n n ,

j, k = 1, . . . , n  1,

(53)

where  s on the right refer to the n  n matrix of couplings computed above in the
u(n) theory. this subtraction just reects the fact that in the su(n) theory, one
of the n u(1) subgroups is not independent of the others since their generators sum
to zero. to include the theta angles (making  complex), we can simply drop the
absolute value signs in (52). although there is not a unique way of assigning phases
to the arguments of the logarithms, the ambiguity is easily seen to be equivalent to
an electric-magnetic duality transformation (an integer shift of the low energy  jks).
thus, the one-loop threshold contribution is

i jk

0 = jkn ln(2vj) 

nxa6=j

ln(va  vj) + (1  jk) ln(vj  vk)

 ln(vj  vn )  ln(vk  vn ) + n ln(2vn ) 

ln(v  vn ).

(54)

n 1x=1

finally, this expression is not necessarily symmetric under interchange of j and k. but
in the low-energy eective action it multiplies a term symmetric on these indices, so
we should simply symmetrize (54).

at the special vacuum, where va = a, (54) gives

where we have used the fact that qn 1

k=1 (1  k) = n (see appendix b), have made
some integral electric-magnetic duality shifts as in (41), and where ljk is given in (37).4
the matching between (55) and the one-loop threshold contribution from the curve,
given in eq. (38) is achieved by choosing

c0 = 2n +2.

(56)

note that this value of c0 diers from the one implicit in the curve found in [13], which
gave c0 = 4, whose normalization is expected to satisfy our perturbative matching
requirements (in light of the result of [18] of no thresholds in the dr scheme). the
dierence of a factor of 2
can be traced back to an incorrect extra factor of 2 in
the superpotential mass term (1) of [13].

2n

5.4 one-instanton contribution

the low energy n = 2 eective action is usefully expressed in terms of the prepotential
[23], a scalar function of the vector superelds, in terms of which the matrix of low
energy couplings is given by

 jk 

1
2

2f
vjvk

,

(57)

where the vj are a set of n  1 independent vevs on the coulomb branch. when the
superpotential is given as a function of the vas, as in the instanton calculation of [8] to
which we are comparing the curve results, we can take the n  1 independent coulomb
branch vevs to be the rst n  1 of the va used in (2). the tracelessness constraint
on the va then implies that vn is not an independent variable, and so the low-energy
coupling must be computed by

 jk =

1

2  
vj 



vn!  

vk 



vn!f

(58)

where the partial derivatives are taken treating all n va as independent variables. the
prepotential expanded about q = 0 yields a classical piece, a one-loop correction and
instanton corrections:

f =

4the one-loop contribution to  jk in the special vacuum was reported in [10] to be  jk

this matches our result except for a (1 + jk)n ln 2/(2i) term. this is due to the factor of 2 in the
hypermultiplet masses (51), which was neglected in [10].

taking derivatives of this expansion as in (58) yields the instanton expansion (25) of
the low energy coupling  jk.

the one-instanton prepotential for nf  2n was calculated in [8]. applying their

result to nf = 2n with massless matter gives the one-instanton prepotential:

(60)

where b, c, d = 1, . . . , n and c 
1 is a scheme-dependent constant. dierentiating this
expression twice as in (58) and evaluating the resulting sums and products in the special
vacuum, we obtain after a lengthy computation (see appendix b) the one-instanton
contribution to  jk in the special vacuum:

implies

(62)

special vacuum. this determines the rst two coecients c0 and c1 in the expansion

thus, we have successfully matched the curve e jk with the semiclassical  jk in the
of eq in terms of q of (29). note that this is a non-trivial matching since the matching
of the n  n matrix of low-energy eective couplings forms a system of 1
2n(n + 1)
equations in 2 unknowns for each n. the existence of a solution for c0 and c1 for all
n thus provides an innite number of physical checks matching the predictions of the
exact results and the semi-classical results at the special vacuum.
