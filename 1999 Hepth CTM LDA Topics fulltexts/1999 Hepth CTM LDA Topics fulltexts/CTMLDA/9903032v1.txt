abstract

a non-trivial super black hole solution is considered as rep-
resenting a combined model of the kerr spinning particle and
superparticle.

treatment is based on the broken n=2 supersymmetry in su-
pergravity in analogue with deser-zumino model of broken su-
persymmetry in n=1 supergravity. there appears a non-linear
realization of broken supersymmetry, which is very specic for
the kerr geometry and which leads to a family of the exact non-
trivial rotating and charged super black hole solutions (super-
kerr-newman solutions).

peculiarities of the super-kerr-newman solutions and in par-
ticular the appearance of the short ranging traveling waves of tor-
sion and other elds, build of the nilpotent grassmann variables,
on the pure bosonic kerr-newman background are discussed.

1 introduction

since 1968 it has been mentioned that the kerr-newman solution possesses
some remarkable properties which allow to consider it as a model of spinning
particle [1, 2]. this point of view was also suggested by superstring theory
[3, 4].
in previous papers [5, 6] we considered supergeneralization of the
kerr solution as a model of spinning particle. such super black hole class of
solutions contains fermionic degrees of freedom and possesses the combined
properties of the kerr spinning particle and superparticle models.

in the present paper we consider such non-trivial super black holes as
solutions with broken supersymmetry in n=2 supergravity. we show that
some of supersolutions have fermionic traveling waves and traveling waves of
torsion on the kerr-newman background geometry.

2 non-trivial solutions from trivial ones

the problem of non-trivial supergravity solutions is connected with the fact
that any solution of einstein gravity is indeed a trivial solution of super-
gravity eld equations with a zero spin-3/2 eld [7, 8, 9, 10]. by using
a supergauge freedom of supergravity (supertranslations) one can turn the
gravity solutions into a form containing spin-3/2 eld. however, since this
eld can be gauged away by the reverse transformation, such supersolutions
are indeed trivial. there existed even an opinion that all the super black
hole solutions are trivial. however, some examples of the non-trivial super
black hole solutions were given by aichelburg and guven [11, 12], and also
in two dimensional dilaton supergravity by knutt-wehau and mann [13].

in previous papers [5, 6] we showed that non-trivial examples of the
super-kerr geometry can be obtained by a trivial supershift of the kerr
solution taking into account some non-linear b-slice constraints. indeed, the
complex structure of the kerr geometry prompts how to avoid this triviality
problem.

the kerr-schild form of the kerr geometry [14] gik = ik + 2hkikk allows
to give a complex representation of the kerr solution as a geometry generated
by a complex source propagating along a complex world line xi
0( ) in auxiliary
minkowski space  = diag(, + + +). this representation shows that from
complex point of view the schwarzschild and kerr geometries are equivalent

2

and connected by a trivial complex shift.

the non-trivial twisting structure of the kerr geometry arises as a result of
the shifted real slice of the complex retarded-time construction [4]. if the real
slice is passing via center of the solution x0 there appears a usual spherical
symmetry of the schwarzschild geometry. the specic twisting structure
results from the complex shift of the real slice regarding the source.

similarly, it is possible to turn a trivial super black hole solution into

a non-trivial if one nds an analogue to the real slice in superspace.

the trivial supershift can be represented as a replacement of the complex

world line by a superworldline

x i

0( ) = xi

parametrized by grassmann coordinates ,
dinate replacement in the kerr solution

0( )  ii  + ii ,

(1)
, or as a corresponding coor-

xi = xi + ii   ii ;

 =  + ,

 =  + ,

(2)

assuming that coordinates xi before the supershift are the usual c-number
coordinates one sees that coordinates acquire nilpotent grassmann contribu-
tions after supertranslations. therefore, there appears a natural splitting
of the space-time coordinates on the c-number body-part and a nilpotent
part - the so called soul. the body subspace of superspace, or b-slice, is
a submanifold where the nilpotent part is equal to zero, and it is a natural
analogue to the real slice in complex case.

it has been shown in [5, 6] that reproducing the real slice procedure of the
kerr geometry in superspace we have to consider super light cone constraints

s2 = [xi  x0i( )][xi  x i

0( )] = 0,

(3)

and b-slice, where coordinates xi do not contain nilpotent contributions. se-
lecting the body and nilpotent parts of this equation we obtain three equa-
tions. the rst one is the real slice condition of the complex kerr geometry
claiming that complex light cones, described by set

x = x0( ) +  ,

(4)

can reach the real slice. here  is the commuting two-component spinor
determining the principal null congruence of the kerr geometry

ki = p 1i .

3

(5)

the nilpotent part yields two b-slice conditions
  i
0( )](i
(    )2 = 0.

[xi  xi

) = 0;

equation (6) may be rewritten using (4) in the form

which yields

(i      i   )i

 



 = 0

 = 0,

 = 0,

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

which in turn is a condition of proportionality of the commuting spinors
(x) and anticommuting spinors  and , this condition providing the left
null superplanes of the supercones to reach b-slice.

finally, by introducing the kerr projective spinor coordinate y (x) we

have  2 = y (x),

 1 = 1, and we obtain

  =  
  =  

 1
y (x) 1 !
 1
y (x) 1 !

(10)

(11)

it also leads to   =   = 0, and equation (7) is satised automatically.
thus, as a consequence of the b-slice and superlightcone constraints we
 = (x). the orig-
obtain a non-linear submanifold of superspace  = (x),
inal four-dimensional supersymmetry is broken, and the initial supergauge
freedom which allowed to turn the super geometry into trivial one is lost.
nevertheless, there is a residual supersymmetry based on free grassmann
parameters 1,

1.

it was mentioned that the above b-slice constraints yield infact the non-
linear realization of broken supersymmetry introduced by volkov and akulov
[15, 16] and considered in n=1 supergravity by deser and zumino [17]. in ter-
 (x)
minology of broken supersymmetry the grassmann parameters  (x),
represent some fermion goldstone eld on space-time which has to be eaten
by spin-3/2 rarita-schwinger eld. as a result supergauge will be xed.

in this paper we consider the application of this approach to obtaining the
superversions of the kerr-newman solution to n=2 supergravity formulated
in [18].

3 broken supersymmetry in n=1 supergrav-

ity

here we use spinor notations of the book [16]. the indices i, j, k, l... are
related to coordinate, and a, b, c, d... are reserved for tetrad.

the volkov-akulov model of non-linear realization of supersymmetry
[15, 16] is based on selecting a submanifold of superspace setting the cor-
respondence of the grassmann coordinates 2

  !
 =   

(12)

to a goldstone eld (x) which is a majorana fermion. this yields the
submanifold (x) = b(x) which is non-linear in general case. the non-
linear residual supertransformations are

 = b1 + ib(i)i(x),

(13)

  !
and contain inhomogeneous term b1 =   

considered by deser and zumino case of broken n=1 supergravity is
based on this model [17], and it is proposed that  admits local transforma-
tions (x).

the lagrangian is given by 3

l = (i/2)d  (i/2b)ii + lsg.

where the supergravity lagrangian is

and

lsg = er/2k2  i/2ijkl i5jdkl,

di = i

2

iabab;

ab =

[a, b].

(14)

(15)

(16)

2 further we use the dirac four-component spinor notations.
3we have omitted here cosmological term since here we shall consider only the region

of massless elds.

5

the lagrangian is invariant by the above non-linear supertransformations,
and tetrad ea and rarita-schwinger elds i are transformed as follows

 = b1 + ib(i)i,

i = ikai,
ea
i = 2/kdi.

(17)

(18)

(19)

it is assumed that this construction is similar to the higgs mechanism
of the usual gauge theories. the goldstone fermion (x) can be eaten by
appropriate local transformation (x) with a corresponding redenition of the
tetrad and spin-3/2 eld. it means that starting from the gravity solution
with zero spin-3/2 eld and some goldstone fermion eld  one can obtain
in such a way a non-trivial supergravity solution with non-linear realization
of broken supersymmetry.

there are two obstacles for indirect application of this scheme to the
kerr-newman case. first one is the electromagnetic charge which demands
to change the expression for supercovariant derivative that leads to non-
majorana values for spin-3/2 eld. the second one is the complex character
of supertranslations in the kerr case that also yields the non-majorana su-
pershifts. thus, this scheme has to be extended to n=2 supergravity.

4 broken supersymmetry in n=2 supergrav-

ity

the consistent n=2 supergravity described by ferrara and nieuwenhuizen
[18] is based on the complex (non-majorana) supergauge eld  = (1 +
i2)/2 and contains a complex spin-3/2 eld  = ( + i)/2 and the
vector potential of electromagnetic eld ai.

the expression for supercovariant derivative (see appendix b) is extended
by electromagnetic contribution fab and torsion terms dn i = (k2/2)abkiab,
(20)

dci = di + dn i  (ik/22)fababi.

the action is invariant under the following complex local supersymmetry
transformations

ea

i = k(ai  ia)

6

(21)

i = (2/k)dci.

ai = i2(i  i).

(22)

(23)

the extension of the expression (17) on the complex non-majorana case is
given by

 = b1 + ib(i)i,

(24)

now we have to use the above considered complex supershift and superlight-
cone constraints of the kerr geometry (10, 11) in n=2 supergravity. one
should note, that the above superlightcone constraints restrict values of su-
pershift parameters , leaving the values of  free, which leads in general case
to a non-majorana spinor

 =   
  !

(25)

corresponding to a complex supershift. further, we should note that su-
percovariant derivative contains the nonlinear in  terms from torsion dn ,
which hinders the indirect use of nite supertranslations. at the other hand
the kerr constraints on , (11), select a submanifold displaying a remarkable
nilpotency  2 = 0. it means, that the values of  on this submanifold lie in
a degenerate subalgebra of the grassmann algebra [8, 19]. 4

to avoid the non-linear terms from torsion we will extend this property

on the four-component spinor , and will restrict supershift by the form

where

 = 21/2  s

s  ! ,

s2 = s2 = 0;

ss + ss = 0,

(26)

(27)

this form possesses the nilpotency 2 = 0 that leads to cancelling the non-
linear term dn , and gives rise to validity (21, 22, 23) under nite super-
translations. the formulated in n=1 case problem of the absorption of the

4it means that the complex expansion  = (1)

pqrspsqsr...., where spsq +
sqsp = 0, contains there only the rst non-zero term s2 = s2 = 0;
ss + ss = 0. this
degeneracy take place only on the considered subspace of supershifts, however, even in a
very narrow neighborhood of this subspace the full algebra has to be taken into account. in
particular, by application spinor supercovariant derivatives when the grassmann variables
have to be considered as independent.

goldstone fermion  is reduced to a choice of supergauge eld

(x) = b(x)

, that leads to satisfying (24) and yields  =  +   0, if we assume that
 has corresponding nilpotency.
below we present few examples of supershift functions and will see that
the most interesting case is when the  satises the massless dirac equation.

5 examples of n=2 solutions

we rst represent the results in the case of arbitrary nilpotent supershift
satisfying the constraints (11). it is convenient to perform all calculations
in the local lorentz frame of the kerr geometry where -matrices take the
form [9, 12, 20]

i i(3) = 0 that has the consequence a =
will be called as aligned to e3 if e3
d = 0. similarly, spinor (4) is aligned to e4 if e4
i i(4) = 0, which yields
b = c = 0. therefore, any four component spinor can be split on the
sum of two aligned spinors  = (3) + (4). physically, the e3 (e4) aligned
solution describes the waves in the e3 (e4) null direction.
in many cases
(especially massless) solutions of these aligned parts are independent. in the
algebraically special kerr-newman geometry all the tensor elds are aligned

to the principal null direction e3. the supershift constraints (11) represent
in fact a condition for the two-component spinor  to be aligned to e3. in
the local lorentz frame it takes the form  2 = 0, the second component
 1 = c is free. therefore, the general form of supershift satisfying the kerrs
superconstraints and nilpotency condition will be

the function y (x) is the main function determining the principal null con-
gruence (5) and the kerr tetrad. it can be expressed as a projective spinor
coordinate y = 0/ 1 5, and satises the equation dy = z[e1  (p y /p )e3],
where p = 21/2(1 + y y ) for the stationary kerr-newman background. the
corresponding kerr tetrad ea is given in the appendix c. the resulting nilpo-
tent contribution to tetrad contains two terms, contributions from metric and
from electromagnetic eld ea = gea + f ea. the metric part will be

ge1 = ss2[( cc  bb)dy  adb + bd a + aag + ab(h + h)]
ge2 =  e1
ge3 = ss2[( ab)d y  a bdy + ad a  ada + a a( h  h)]

electromagnetic contribution to tetrad is

we have the free spinor components

 =   a(x)

determining the supershift. now we consider some particular cases leading
to simplication of general expressions.

5this function is determined by the kerr theorem [4, 14]. a xation of y selects the

null planes in cm 4 and null rays of the principal null congruence.

5.1 case i
the simplest spinor shift a(x) 6= 0, b = 0, considered in the basis having
the -matrices adapted to the auxiliary minkowski space ik. the peculiarity
of this shift is that while transformed to the aligned basis 6 this spinor takes
the same simple form that allows to simplify expressions

 =   a(x)

0 ! ,

(44)

we will also assume that c = 1, and obtain for g contribution to tetrad

ge1 = ss2[dy + aag]
ge2 =  e1
ge3 = ss2[ad a  ada + a a( h  h)]
ge4 = ss2( h  h),

and f contribution

f e1 = ikss/2[e1( a n  an)  a se3]
f e2 = f
f e3 = iksse3( a n + an)/2
f e4 = ikss(ne4 + se1)( a + a)/2.

e1

contributions to vector potential a will be

ga = i(ss2/k)(da  d a + 2ah  2 a h),
f a = ss/2[(e1 + e2)a a + (e3 + e4a a)(n + n )]

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

one can see that the wave oscillations of the shift, a = eipixi
can lead to the
wave oscillations of the terms f ea in tetrad and the term ga in the vector
potential. since in the kerr-newman geometry function n has the behavior
n  z 2, the tetrad oscillations are growing near the kerr singular ring and
take the form of waves travelling along the singularity. however, in this case
we do not have clear proposals concerning mechanisms or the possible origin
of such oscillations in supershift. some suggestion to this case follows from
observation that such oscillating spinor  resembles oscillating solutions of
the dirac equation.

6transformations of the dirac spinors from the e3-aligned basis to the basis of auxiliary

minkowski space are given in appendix d.

11

5.2 case ii
the spinor shift has parameters a = 0, b 6= 0, considered in the basis
where -matrices are adapted to the auxiliary minkowski space ik. being
transformed to the aligned basis this spinor takes the form a = b y ; b 6= 0.
this case does not lead to essential simplications in respect to the general
case, and we will not write down the expressions for this case, but we should
note that appearance of traveling waves for oscillating b can be observed in
this case, too.

5.3 case iii
the case of supershifts aligned to e3: a = 0; b 6= 0, considered in the aligned
e3 basis. 7 this case yields maximal simplications of the expressions and is
motivated by super-qed model of broken supersymmetry for the region of
matter elds.

there is no electromagnetic contributions to tetrad in this case and we

have

e1 = ss2(c c  b b)dy
e2 =  e1
e3 = 0
e4 = ss2[(c c  b b)h( z  z) + cdc  cd c + bdb  bd b].(52)

(49)
(50)
(51)

the contribution to the kerr-newman vector potential will be

ga = i(ss22/k)[ bcdy  b cd y ],
f a = ss/2e3[(b b + c c)(n + n)]

(54)
the case c = b could be called pseudo-majorana. in this case there are
no nilpotent contributions to tetrad at all, ea = 0, and metric has pure
bosonic form similar to the case of extreme black holes without an angu-
lar momentum. however, the kerr-newman vector potential has nilpotent
contributions, and moreover, it can have traveling waves from the term

(53)

(55)

ga = i(ss22/k)( b2dy  b2d y ),

7if -matrices were adapted to auxiliary minkowski frame this shift is given by param-

eters a =  y ; b = 1. see matrices of transformation in appendix d.

12

in the case of independent b and c there also appears tetrad traveling waves.
the interpretation of  as a goldstone fermion which has to be massless
support the proposal that supershift (x) has to satisfy the massless dirac
equation.
in the appendix b we have given the solutions of the massless
dirac equation on the kerr-newman background in the aligned to e3 case.
the corresponding functions b and c have the form

b = zfb( y ,  )/p,

c = zfc(y,  )/p,

(56)

where fb and fc are arbitrary analytic functions, and ,2 = ,4 = 0, and
y,2 = y,4 = 0.

the solutions are singular on the kerr singular ring, z 1  p 1(r +
ia cos ) = 0, and contain traveling waves if there is an oscillating dependence
on complex time parameter  . the angular dependence of these solutions
on  is determined by the degree of function y = eitan/2. one sees
that any non-trivial analytic dependence on y will lead to a singularity in .
thus, besides the singular ring the solution contain an extra axial singularity
which is coupled topologically with the kerr singular ring threading it. one
should note that singular rarita-schwinger hair was mentioned earlier by
aichelburg and guven [12, 20] as an obstacle to form a super black hole in
the case of the kerr geometry 8. however, when considering this solution as
a model of spinning particle we have to treat a region of parameters a  m
leading to a naked disk-like super-source [5] without horizons that allows to
avoid the objections relating to rotating black holes.

one should also note that this axial singularity can change the position
in time, so that the phase speed of the position can exceed the speed of light.
9 one simple example of such function is

b = z/[f1( )  y f2( )]1,

where the position of the axial singularity is determined by the root of
equation y = f1/f2 depending on the retarded-time parameter  .

8also see solutions in [21]
9 in some sense this singularity can scan the space time. at the other hand the topo-
logical coupling with the kerr ring provides its guiding role for the ring that allows to
consider this couple of singularities as a wave-pilot construction in the spirit of the old de
broglie ideas.

6 conclusion

we have represented three families of the rotating and charged super black
hole solutions which are supergeneralizations of the kerr-newman solution

10the kerr-newman solution with torsion based on the poincare gauge theory has been

considered in [22].

14

and represent a combined model of the kerr spinning particle and superpar-
ticle [5].

treatment is based on the partially broken supersymmetry in n=2 su-
pergravity with a non-linear realization of broken supersymmetry, which is
very specic for the kerr geometry, and which leads to a family of the exact
non-trivial rotating and charged super black hole solutions.

main peculiarity of this super-kerr-newman geometry is the appearance
of the traveling waves, build of the nilpotent grassmann elds, on the bosonic
kerr-newman background. in contrast to traveling waves in the einstein
maxwell theory these elds are short range and do not lead to radiative
catastrophes. however, the connected with these elds axial singular line
needs a more detailed investigation.

the considered families of solutions are depending on the goldstone
fermion eld . at present stage of investigation our knowledge regarding the
origin of goldstone fermions is very restricted. usually, their origin is con-
nected with the breaking of supersymmetry in the region of matter elds. for
example, spontaneously broken supersymmetry in the wess-zumino model
of super-qed [16] leads to massless goldstone fermions, and their sources
are connected with massive dirac elds.

when considering the super black hole solution we are interested mainly
in the region of massless elds. however, as it was mentioned in [5, 6], for the
known parameters of spinning particles the angular momentum is very high,
regarding the mass parameter. in this case the black hole horizons disappear
and a hard core region of superconducting disk-like source has to be taken
into account. treatment of this region is going out of the frame of this paper.
however, we should note that investigations of such super-sources should be
connected with seiberg-witten theory [23] and with some other interesting
models of broken supersymmetry together with gauge symmetry breaking
[24, 25, 26, 27].

the supercovariant derivative in complex n=2 case has the form

(73)

(74)

the metric part of the supercovariant derivative is

di = i  1

.

(76)

for the e3-aligned solutions the kerr-newman electromagnetic eld drops
out from the dirac equation. in the nilpotent case (31) the nonlinear term
drops out too. the spinor-valued 1-form expression dd takes the form

dd = 


b( ze2 + y ,3 e3)

db + b[h,4 +(z  z)h/2]e3
dc + c[h,4 (z  z)h/2]e3

c(ze1 + y,3 e3)

.




(77)

as a result, the dirac equation adad = 0 yields the four equations:

and

c,4 +zc = 0;

c,2 cy,3 = 0,

b,4 + zb = 0;

b,1 b y ,3 = 0,

(78)

(79)

these equations can be easily solved by using the known basis relations of
the kerr-schild formalism (see appendix a).

first equation (78) gives c = zc0 where c0,4 = 0. then, substituting
c and into second equation we obtain c = z/p , where  must satisfy the
conditions ,2 = ,4 = 0. therefore,  must be a function taking constant
values on the null planes spanned by vectors e1 and e3. these null planes
are left null planes of a foliation of space-time into complex null cones. in
another terminology they represent a geometrical image of twistors and can
be parametrized by twistor coordinates. all the twistor coordinates ;and
 = xii satisfy the relations (...),2 = (...),4 = 0, see [4] . coordinate y is in
fact one of the (projective) twistor coordinates. for our problem it will be
convenient to use a retarded time coordinate  . the retarded time coordinate
to a point x is dened by a point of intersection of light cone emanated from
x with a world-line of source.

the light cone is split on the left and right null planes, therefore, the
retarded time parameter takes constant values on the null cone. besides, it
satisfy the relations ,2 = ,4 = 0 on the left null planes. 11 for the kerr
geometry one can use a known complex interpretation containing a complex
world line for the source. in the rest frame the complex light cone equation
(t )2 = r2 can be split with a selection of retarded fold r = t . here t is a
real time coordinate, and r = r + ia cos  = p/z is a complex radial distance
from the real point x to a point of source at the complex world line. it yields
 = t  r. therefore, the function  can be an arbitrary analytic function
of complex coordinates y and  , and we have solution c = (y,  )z/p . for
function b one can obtain similarly b = ( y ,  ) z/p , where coordinates y
and  satisfy the relations (...),1 = (...),4 = 0 , and are constant on the right
null planes of the light cone foliation.

11details of this construction can be found in [4].

appendix c. the kerr tetrad and some useful
matrix expressions

the kerr tetrad ea is determined by function y (x):

e1 = d  y dv,
e3 = du + y d + y d  y y dv,
e4 = dv + he3,

e2 = d  y dv,

(80)

where the null cartesian coordinates are used 2u = z + t, 2v = z 
t, 2u = x + iy, 2v = x  iy.
