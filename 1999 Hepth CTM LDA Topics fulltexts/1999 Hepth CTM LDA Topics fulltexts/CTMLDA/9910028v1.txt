abstract

one-dimensional sigma-models with n supersymmetries are considered. for
conventional supersymmetries there must be n  1 complex structures satisfying a
cliord algebra and the constraints on the target space geometry can be formulated

in terms of these. in the cases in which the complex structures are simultaneously

integrable, a conventional extended superspace formulation is given, with the ge-

ometry determined by a 2-form potential for n = 2, by a 1-form potential for

n = 3 and a scalar potential for n = 4; for n > 4 it is given by a scalar potential

satisfying dierential constraints. this gives explicit constructions of models with

n = 3 but not n = 4 supersymmetry and of n = 4 models in which the complex

structures do not satisfy a quaternionic algebra. generalisations with central terms

in the superalgebra are also considered.

1. sigma models and supersymmetry

the conditions for supersymmetry in one-dimensional sigma-models were given

by coles and papadopoulos [1] and further studied in [2-6]. the analysis is similar

to that of two-dimensional sigma-models, for which there is a rich relation between

target space geometry and the amount of supersymmetry. the geometries of the

two dimensional supersymmetric models were rst classied in [7] and have been

studied extensively [7-21]. remarkably, the conditions in one dimension are con-

siderably weaker, giving a much wider range of geometries. the one-dimensional

models have many applications. the moduli spaces for supersymmetric black holes

are the target spaces of certain d = 1 supersymmetric sigma-models and the sigma-

model describes the geodesic motion in the moduli space [2,5]. supersymmetric

quantum mechanics also arises in the light cone quantization of supersymmetric

eld theories [6]. the aim here is to study further the geometries of one-dimensional

supersymmetric sigma-models and to give explicit constructions of certain classes

of models.

the standard supersymmetry algebra in one dimension is

{qi, qj} = 2ij h

(1.1)

where {qi ; i = 1, . . . , n} are the supersymmetry charges and h is the hamilto-
nian. there are some generalisations, such as the twisted superalgebra

{qi , qj} = 2ijh

(1.2)

for some metric ij or arbitrary signature [19,20], or the addition of extra terms

{qi, qj} = 2ij h + zij

(1.3)

the extra generators zij are central in some cases, and in others their commutators

with q, h, z lead to further generators and a larger algebra. the general algebra

2

can be written as

{qi , qj} = x ij

(1.4)

and h and zij can then be dened by the trace and trace-free parts of x ij with
respect to some metric ij.

in some cases it is more natural to consider (1.4)

rather than to split x into h and z. we will consider models in which each of

these algebras arise.

the plan of the paper is as follows. in sections 2,3 and 4, sigma-models with

n = 1, n = 2 and n = 4 supersymmetries are discussed, reviewing the results of

[1,2,5] and presenting extended superspace formulations which give simple deriva-

tions of some of the results of [5]. for conventional supersymmetry, there must be
n  1 complex structures satisfying certain conditions. the general n = 2 geome-
try is specied by a 2-form potential (considered further in section 6). generalisa-

tions are discussed in which superalgebras such as (1.3) or (1.4) arise, extending the

results of [3,4] to geometries with torsion, allowing the realisation of n = 2 super-

symmetry on almost complex manifolds, or on manifolds with no almost complex

structure (and so of arbitrary dimension and signature) which admit generalised

yano-killing tensors. in section 5, new models with n = 3 supersymmetry but not

n = 4 supersymmetry are found, which have three (almost) complex structures

but only two of which lead to extra supersymmetries.

in the case in which the

three complex structures are simultaneously integrable, the geometry is given in

terms of a 1-form potential, giving the local construction of all such models. in

section 6, the conditions for n extended supersymmetry for general n are dis-

cussed, requiring the target space to be a manifold with a cliord structures (a
set of n  1 complex structures satisfying a cliord algebra) and to have a geom-
etry which we refer to as cliord kahler with torsion (ckt), in analogy with the

nomenclature suggested in [12] of kahler with torsion (kt) for the geometry of

(2,0) sigma-models [9] and hyper-kahler with torsion (hkt) for the geometry of

the (4,0) sigma-models rst found in [7]. the case of n = 4 is considered in section

7. in the special case in which the three complex structures satisfy the algebra of

3

unit imaginary quaternions, the geometry was shown in [5] and in section 4 to be

weak hkt. in the general case (in which the complex structures do not necessarily

satisfy the quaternion algebra), the geometry for the case in which the complex

structures are simultaneously integrable is shown to be given locally in terms of a

scalar potential by an expression that reduces to the expression of section 4 and [5]

for the quaternionic case. for n > 4, the geometry cannot be weak hkt, and the

scalar potential must satisfy certain dierential constraints; non-trivial examples

of such geometries are known for n = 8 [2]. under certain conditions similar to

those derived in [5], these models can have osp(n/1) superconformal symmetry.

2. n=1 one-dimensional supersymmetry

the simplest form of n=1 supersymmetric sigma model of [1] is dened on a
d-dimensional manifold m with metric g and a 3-form c (which is not closed in
general) and has an n = 1 superspace action

i =

(2.2)

t is the worldline parameter,  is a real fermionic variable and x i(t, ) is an un-
constrained real supereld, which gives a map from superspace to m, with x i
real coordinates on m. the generalisation considered in [1] in which fermionic
superelds are added will not be considered here.

expanding the supereld x i gives the component elds

x i = x i|

i = dx i| ,

(2.3)

consisting of d scalar elds x i and d real fermionic elds i. the component

and  is the levi-civita connection of the metric g. if c is closed then this action

can be obtained by dimensionally reducing the action [9] of (1,0) supersymmetric

two-dimensional sigma models.

3. n=2 one-dimensional supersymmetry

3.1. complex geometry and supersymmetry

there are two basic kinds of n = 2 models in 1 dimension. the n = 2a models

are constructed from unconstrained real n = 2superelds while the n = 2b models

use complex chiral superelds. the dimensional reduction of (1,1) supersymmetric

two dimensional sigma-models gives n = 2a models while the reduction of (2,0)

supersymmetric two dimensional sigma-models gives n = 2b models. both have

been constructed in [1,2]. here we shall consider only the n=2b models and the

special cases in which they have extra supersymmetry (such as the n=4b and

n=8b models of [2]) and we shall begin by reviewing the results of [1,2].

to determine the conditions on the couplings of the action (2.1) required by

n=2 supersymmetry, we follow [8] and express the second supersymmetry trans-

5

formation in terms of the n=1 supereld x as

x i =  i i

jdx j ,

(3.1)

where  is the parameter of the transformation. the n = 2 superalgebra will be

satised if i satises

and

i 2 =  

n k

ij(i) = 0,

where n (i) is the nijenhuis tensor of i, dened by

n k

ij(i)  i l

ii k

[j,l]  i l

ji k

[i,l]

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

the condition (3.2) implies that i is an almost complex structure, requiring that

the target space dimension be even, and (3.3) implies that the almost complex

structure is integrable, and so is a complex structure.

it was shown in [1,2] that the action (2.1) is invariant under this transformation

provided that

(3.5)

[i(cid:0)i m

jc|m|kl](cid:1)  2i m

an alternative derivation was given in [4]. the rst condition is that the metric

g is hermitian with respect to the complex structure i. the last condition was

written in [2] as

i dc 

2
3

dic = 0

(3.6)

where i is the inner derivation with respect to the the complex structure i. this

6

acts on an n-form  as

i1...indx i1  dx i2...  dx in  (i ),

(3.7)

if the metric is hermitian, c is closed and the complex structure is covariantly

constant with respect to the (+) connection,

(+)

i

i j

k = 0 ,

(3.8)

then these conditions are all satised and the model can be obtained by dimensional

reduction of a (2,0) supersymmetric sigma model in two dimensions. however,

these conditions are much stronger than (3.5), so that there are many geometries

that allow d = 1, n = 2b models but not (2,0) d = 2 models.

the complex structure enables us to introduce complex coordinates z, so that

x i = (z, z ) (,  = 1, ..., d/2) and the complex structure is constant

i i

j =  i

(3.9)

and the line element for the hermitian metric is ds2 = 2g dzd z .

3.2. generalised symmetries

for (3.1) to be a symmetry, it is sucient for (3.5) to be satised. if (3.5) is

satised but (3.2),(3.3) are not, then the symmetry algebra will not be the usual
supersymmetry algebra (1.1). for example, if i 2 = +1 and (3.3) holds, then i is a

real structure and the algebra is a twisted superalgebra (1.2) of the type studied

in [19,20]. if i is an almost complex structure satisfying (3.2) but not (3.3), then

7

the commutator of two transformations of the form (3.1) gives the new symmetry

x i = n i

jkdx jdx k

(3.10)

with bosonic parameter . the superalgebra is then of the form (1.3) with z22 the

charge generating this new symmetry. this is a central charge commuting with

q, h and so the supersymmetry algebra closes without further generators, by an

argument similar to that given for two-dimensional sigma models in [15- 18].

in the general case in which (3.5) is satised but (3.2),(3.3) are not, the super-
algebra is of the form (1.4) with x 11 = h, x 12 = 0, but x 22 generates the bosonic

symmetry

where

x i = (2iri

jtx i + n i

jkdx jdx k)

ri

j = (i 2)i

j

(3.11)

(3.12)

if the trace (i 2)i
i is non-zero, it can be set to one by scaling i, in which case
the algebra takes the form (1.3) with z11 = h, z12 = 0, but z22 generating the
symmetry (3.11) with ri

j. such symmetries have been considered in

[3,4].

j = (i 2   )i

3.3. the torsion-free case

if the torsion c vanishes, then the second condition in (3.5) becomes the con-

dition

(ii k

j) = 0

(3.13)

implying that iij is a yano killing-tensor, as was pointed out in the context of one-

dimensional supersymmetric sigma models in [3]. for an almost complex structure

satisfying (3.13), the hermiticity condition in (3.5) together with (3.2) implies that

8

(m, g, i) is an almost tachibana space [22]. the condition (3.13) implies that the
nijenhuis tensor can be written as

n k
ij = i k

lii l

j

(3.14)

then if in addition i is a complex structure with n (i) = 0, (3.14) implies that the
complex structure must be covariantly constant, i = 0, and the space must be
kahler. (an almost tachibana space with vanishing nijenhuis tensor is also called

a tachibana space, but this is the equivalent to the kahler condition.)

if i is not an almost complex structure, but is a general yano killing-tensor,

then the tensor ri
j is a stackel-killing tensor and the symmetry algebra
is of the form (1.4) with x 22 generating the symmetry (3.11). this is the case

j = (i 2)i

analysed in [3], where a number of examples were considered. models with n = 2

supersymmetry of this type can arise for odd dimensional target spaces as well as

for even dimensional ones, and for lorentzian signature target spaces, such as the

kerr-newman black hole [3]. it would be interesting to investigate whether there
are bps states associated with the central charge z22.

3.4. n=2 superspace action

the n = 2b one-dimensional supersymmetric model can be written in n = 2
superspace with coordinates t, 0, 1 and supercovariant derivatives d0, d1 satis-
fying

d2

0 = i

d

d2

d0d1 + d1d1 = 0 .

(3.15)

it is useful to dene d = d0 + id1,  = 0 + i1 so that

d2 = 0,

{d, d} = 2i

d
dt

,

(3.16)

and introduce chiral superelds z and their complex conjugates z  satisfying

dz = 0

(3.17)

(3.18)

(cid:1) ,

for some g , b, with b   = (b), plus a chiral superpotential term

s =z dt d w (z) +z dt d w ( z)

for some holomorphic function w . the action is invariant under

b  b + []

and so only depends on the holomorphic eld strength

(3.19)

(3.20)

e = 3[b]

(3.21)

dimensional reduction of the superspace action [14] for the (2,0) model in two

dimensions [9] gives an action of the form

i =

i

2z dt d2(cid:0)ktz  k t z (cid:1) ,

(3.22)

where k is the potential

introduced in [9], but this can be rewritten using

(3.16),(3.17) as

i =

1

4z dt d2(cid:0)k,  + k ,(cid:1)dz d z

 ,

(3.23)

which is of the same form as the g  term in (3.18), and so terms of the form
(3.22) are already included, and (3.18) is indeed the most general action.

10

the n = 2 superelds z give the n = 1 superelds (d  d0)

z = z|1=0

dz = d0z =

1
2dz|1=0

(3.24)

then the 1 integral in (3.18) can be performed (see appendix for details) to give

the n = 1 superspace action (2.1), with

g = 0,

g  = g 

(3.25)

and

c = 2(g,  g,),

c = 12i[b]

(3.26)

together with the complex conjugate equations. thus the geometry is completely

specied in terms of (i) a hermitian metric g  and (ii) a (3,0) form e satisfying
e = 0, so that it can be expressed locally as e = b for some (2,0) form potential
b. then, in terms of the holomorphic exterior derivative  with d =  + ,

c = i(  ) + 4i(e  e)

where (i) is the fundamental form constructed from i:

(i) =

1
2

iijdx i  dx j = ig dz  dz



(3.27)

(3.28)

if e = 0, then for a given hermitian metric, c = i(  ) is the unique torsion
3-form such that the complex structure is covariantly constant,

(+)

k = 0

(3.29)

in the case in which i is an almost complex structure, the unique torsion three-form

for which the complex structure is covariantly constant, (3.29), is

(3.30)

examples of d = 1, n = 2 supersymmetric models on almost complex manifolds

with c given by (3.30) arise from the dimensional reduction of the models of [15-

18].

11

4. n=4 one-dimensional supersymmetry

4.1. conditions for n = 4 supersymmetry

one-dimensional n=4b supersymmetric sigma models arise from the dimen-

sional reduction of the two-dimensional (4,0) supersymmetric sigma-model. the

geometry of these d = 2 models was rst found in [7], and the name hyper-kahler

with torsion (hkt) has been proposed for this geometry [12]. the geometry asso-

ciated with the n=4b model in 1 dimension is not necessarily hkt, but satises

weaker conditions [1,2]. the extended supersymmetry transformations can be writ-

ten in terms of n=1 superelds as [8]

x i = rir

i

jdx j

(4.1)

where {r; r = 1, 2, 3} are the supersymmetry parameters and {ir; r = 1, 2, 3} are
tensors on m. the conditions from the closure of the n=4 supersymmetry algebra
are [1]

 

iris + isir = 2rs
n (ir, is) = 0

(4.2)

where n (ir, is) is the nijenhuis tensor for the pair (ir, is), so that the ir are three
complex structures that anti-commute with one another. the conditions for the

invariance of the action are [1,2]

where r denotes inner derivation with respect to the complex structure ir [2]. the

metric is hermitian with respect to all complex structures.

12

a weak hkt manifold is a riemannian manifold {m, g, c} equipped with a
metric g, a three-form c and three complex structures {ir; r = 1, 2, 3} satisfying
the algebra of imaginary unit quaternions

iris = rs + rstit ,

(4.4)

such that the metric is hermitian with respect to all complex structures and the
complex structures are each covariantly constant with respect to the (+) covariant
derivative

i

(+)
k ir

j = 0 .

(4.5)

if in addition the three-form c is closed, then m has a strong hkt structure.
the target space of two-dimensional (4,0)-supersymmetric sigma models has a

strong hkt structure [7] while any weak hkt manifold solves all the conditions

required by n=4b one-dimensional supersymmetry [2]. it was argued in [5] that

the conditions for n=4b one-dimensional supersymmetry with (4.4) are equivalent

to the ones for weak hkt geometry, but in [2] examples are given of models

admitting n=4b supersymmetry (and in fact n=8b supersymmetry) but which are

not weak hkt. we will now investigate further the general solution of the n=4b

supersymmetry conditions, using superspace constructions, and aim to clarify the

relation between weak hkt geometries and the n = 4 supersymmetry conditions.

4.2. n=2 superspace formulation

suppose the complex structures satisfy the quaternion algebra (4.4). one of

the extra supersymmetries, that parameterised by 3, say, can be made manifest by

using an n = 2 superspace formulation with chiral superelds, so that the action

is of the form (3.18). the remaining two supersymmetry transformations can be

written as

z = j 





d z

(4.6)

together with the complex conjugate relation, where j = 1
2(i1  ii2) and  =
1 + i2. this is consistent with the chirality constraint dz = 0 provided ir are

13

complex structures and

j 

[ ,] = 0

(4.7)

which is the condition that the nijenhuis tensor n (ir, i3) = 0 for r = 1, 2. this
then implies that the remaining nijenhuis tensors also vanish [5,24]. the condition
(4.7) implies that locally there is some f  such that (4.6) can be written as

with

z =  df 

j 

 =  f 

the terms in the variation of the action (3.18) involving  are

(4.10)

where  is the covariant derivative preserving i3, i3 = 0, so that the torsion
3-form for the connection  is given by i(  )3, where 3 is the two-form
constructed from i3. the terms involving  are obtained by complex conjugation.

the terms involving  must vanish separately from those involving , which requires

j() = 0

e = 0
iir

j

k = 0

(4.11)

so that (+) =  and the space is weak hkt. the same result was obtained
studying the conditions (4.3) in complex coordinates in [5]. thus the only n = 4b

models for which the complex structures satisfy the quaternion algebra are those

with weak hkt target spaces.

14

4.3. n=4 superspace

the one-dimensional n=4b supersymmetry multiplet can be written in n=4

a more useful action can be given for the case in which the three complex

structures are simultaneously integrable, that is, there is a local coordinate choice

for which all three complex structures have constant components. the construc-

tion is very similar to that of [8]. here we will discuss the special case in which the

complex structures satisfy the quaternion algebra (4.4), and will defer the general

case until section 7.3. it is convenient to use two complex fermionic superspace co-
ordinates a, a = 1, 2, instead of four real ones, with the supercovariant derivatives
da and their complex conjugates da satisfying

{da,db} = 0,

{da, db} = 2ita

where   is the n n identity matrix, the constraints can be written as follows. the
complex dimension must be even, and the elds z ( = 1, ..., 2n) split into two
sets za, wa where a = 1, ..., n and satisfy the constraints

i3 =  0

daza = 0,
d2wa = i d1 za,

(4.17)

these are a truncation of the n = 4 twisted chiral constraints of [8] (given by

restricting to negative chirality).

the general n=4 superspace action for this twisted chiral n=4b multiplet is

then

i =

1

4z dt d4 l(z, z, w, w)

(4.18)

for an arbitrary function l. integrating over 2, 2 gives an n=2 superspace action
d2 d2l which can be rewritten using (4.17) to be of the form (3.18) with

eijk = 0

(4.19)

and metric g  = g  given by

gza zb = wb  wal + zazb l

gwa wb = zb zal + wa wb l
gza wb = zb  wal + za wb l
gwa zb = wazb l  zawb l

(4.20)

giving a simple superspace derivation of the result of [5]. we have recovered the re-

sult of [5] that the geometry of any weak hkt space with simultaneously integrable

16

complex structures can be given locally in terms of a potential l by (4.20). how-

ever, many hkt spaces do not have simultaneously integrable complex structures

(e.g. any non-trivial hyper-kahler space) and in those cases the geometry is not

given by an unconstrained potential in general (e.g. for hyper-kahler spaces, the

geometry is given by a kahler potential satisfying highly non-trivial constraints).

it is perhaps worth noting that the conditions (given by equation (38) of [8])

for a function l(z, z, w, w) to determine a two-dimensional o-shell (4,4) super-

symmetric sigma-model constructed from twisted chiral multiplets are precisely

the conditions that the metric g  dened by (4.20) vanish.

introducing the notation zau = {za, wa} where u = 1, 2 so that za1 = za
the constraints (4.17) can be

and za2 = wa, and the complex conjugate za


u,

written as

dazau = 0,

dazau = iabuv db za

v

(4.21)

this is the form of the constraint used in [6], where the action (4.18) was also

considered. the metric (4.20) can be rewritten as

 complex conjugation raises or lowers the indices a, b and u, v but not the real indices a, b.

5. n=3 one-dimensional supersymmetry

5.1. complex structures and supersymmetry

we now return to the relation between the argument of [5] that n=4 super-

symmetry (with (4.4)) implies weak hkt geometry and the explicit examples of
models in [2] with n  4 supersymmetry whose geometry is not weak hkt, but is
in fact a geometry with 7 complex structures that was termed okt in [2] (see sec-

tion 7). the resolution lies in an important dierence between the supersymmetric

sigma model geometries in 1 dimension [1]. in both cases, there are m complex

structures satisfying a cliord algebra

where r = 1, ..., m, giving the possibility of n = m + 1 supersymmetries in d = 1

and (m + 1, 0) supersymmetry in d = 2.
covariantly constant with respect to some connection  (possibly with torsion)

if the complex structures are each

ir = 0

(5.2)

then the complex structures must commute with the holonomy group of this con-

nection, and if the holonomy is irreducible this implies that the complex structures

must form a division algebra, so that the only possibilities are m = 0, m = 1 and

m = 3 (the octonion algebra cannot be represented by a set of matrices). thus in

d = 2, the only (n, 0) supersymmetries of standard type that can arise for rigid

supersymmetric sigma-models are those for n = 1, 2, 4 [7]. (other possibilities

such as (3,0) can arise for the more general sigma-models of the type considered in

[7].) in particular, given two covariantly constant complex structures i1, i2, their

product i3 = i1i2 must also be a covariantly constant complex structure and (3,0)

supersymmetry implies (4,0). however, in d = 1 the complex structures are not

18

necessarily covariantly constant, but satisfy the weaker condition

(+)
(i i k

j) = 0

(5.3)

consider the case of n = 3 models with two complex structures i1, i2 satisfying

(4.2),(4.3). the product i3 = i1i2 is an almost complex structure but in general

it will not satisfy the supersymmetry conditions (4.3), so that n = 3 does not

necessarily imply n = 4 supersymmetry [1]. however, if i3 = i1i2 is a complex

structure satisfying these constraints, then the ir satisfy the quaternion algebra

(4.4) and the geometry must be weak hkt, as we saw in the last section.

in

particular, for the n=8 supersymmetric models of [2], the 7 complex structures

satisfy a cliord algebra but not a division algebra, so that the product of any two

complex structures is not a complex structure corresponding to a supersymmetry,

and so the okt geometries need not be weak hkt, and none of the okt examples
in [2] are. more generally, a target space which is not weak hkt can have n  3
supersymmetry provided that for any two complex structures i1, i2 that correspond

to supersymmetries, the product i1i2 does not lead to a supersymmetry.

in this section we will investigate n = 3b models in d = 1 further. these

are of a dierent type to the n = 3 models constructed in [1], which are based

on a real n = 2 supermultiplet, and require the target space structure group

to be reducible. we require two complex structures i1, i2 satisfying (4.2),(4.3).

the supersymmetry corresponding to i1 can be made manifest by using n = 2

superspace with chiral superelds and action (3.18). the extra supersymmetry

transformation corresponding to j = i2 can be written as

z = j 





d z

(5.4)

which is of the same form as (4.6), but now with the important dierence that  is

the real parameter corresponding to the third supersymmetry, whereas  was the

complex parameter  = 1 + i2 in (4.6). moreover, j = i2 here, whereas in (4.6)

19

we had j = 1

2(i1  ii2). again

j 

[ ,] = 0

so that locally there is some f  such that (5.4) can be written as

with

z =  df 

j 

 =  f 

the conditions for invariance of the action (3.18) are

j() = 0
 j = ej 
e  , = 0



(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

these are found from requiring that the sum of (4.10) and its complex conjugate

vanish for real . thus there will be n = 3 supersymmetry for any hermitian

manifold with (3,0) form e = b and an extra complex structure j provided the

conditions (5.8) are satised. we will now construct a large class of n = 3 models

satisfying these constraints and which are not n = 4 supersymmetric.

5.2. n=3 superspace construction

in the special case in which the two complex structures i1, i2 are simultaneously

integrable, we can use a superspace formulation similar to that used in section 4.3.
the supercovariant derivatives can be taken to be d, d, d with d real, satisfying

{d,d} = 0,
{ d,d} = 0,

{d, d} = 2it,
d2 = it

(5.9)

as in section 4.3, we take the complex dimension of the target space to be be even,
and the elds z ( = 1, ..., 2n) split into two sets za, wa where a = 1, ..., n. if

20

the complex structures are taken to be of the form

0

i1 =  i

0 !   
where   is the n  n identity matrix, then the constraints are

0 i!   ,

(5.10)

(5.11)

which can be rewritten in terms of zau = {za, wa} where u = 1, 2, za1 = za and
za2 = wa, as

dazau = 0,

dzau =

1
2

uv d za

v

(5.12)

the general action can be written in terms of an unconstrained 1-form potential
ki(x) = (kau, ka

u) as

i =

2z dt d3 (cid:16)kaudzau + ka

u(cid:17)
u d za

(5.13)

note that a term of the form hau dzau could be rewritten using the constraint
(5.12) to be proportional to d z instead of dz, and so can be absorbed into the k
term in (5.13).

integrating over the third  gives an n = 2 superspace action of the form

(3.18) with

this gives the general construction of n = 3 models with two simultaneously

integrable complex structures in terms of a single potential k, and in the general

21

case with b 6= 0 the complex structures will not be covariantly constant but the
weaker conditions (5.8) will be satised. if b = 0, then the complex structures are

covariantly constant and their product will be a third covariantly constant complex

structure and the space will be weak hkt, with n=4 supersymmetry.

6. one-dimensional supersymmetry for general n

6.1. clifford structures and supersymmetry

in this section we will consider sigma models with n supersymmetries for
any n, so that the n = 1 model (2.1) is invariant under an additional n  1
supersymmetry transformations

x i = aia

(6.1)

where {a; a = 1, . . . , n  1} are the supersymmetry parameters. the conditions
required by the closure of the supersymmetry algebra are

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

where a denotes inner derivation with respect to ia. we shall call a set of m

complex structures satisfying (6.3) a cliord structure, and call a riemannian

22

manifold {m, g, c} equipped with metric g, antisymmetric tensor c, and complex
structures {ia} that obey the compatibility conditions (6.3) and (6.4) a cliord
kahler with torsion manifold, or ckt for short. the name octonionic kahler

with torsion (okt) was suggested in [2] for the special case in which m = 7.

the more general case in which the rst condition in (6.2) is satised but

(6.3) is not, so that the ir are almost complex structures, will lead to an enlarged

supersymmetry algebra of the form (1.3). we will refer to geometries satisfying

(6.2),(6.4) but not (6.3) as almost cliord kahler with torsion manifold, or ackt

for short. this constitutes a generalisation of the almost tachibana spaces that

arose in section 3.2.

more generally, if neither (6.2) nor (6.3) is satised but (6.4) holds, then the
superalgebra is of the form (1.4) with x 00 = h, x 0r = 0, but x rs generates the

bosonic symmetry

x i = (cid:16)2i(rrs)i

jtx i + n (ir, is)i

jkdx jdx k(cid:17)

where

rrs =

1
2{ir, is}

(6.5)

(6.6)

we will restrict ourselves to the ckt case in what follows.

which values of n can arise? in [2], models with n = 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 were con-

structed, and in section 5 models with n = 3 were found. supersymmetry trans-

formations of the form (6.1) satisfying (6.2) can be found for any n. for example,

consider the case in which all complex structures are constant matrices in some

coordinate system. then the complex structures satisfy a cliord algebra and can

be realised as gamma matrices, which must be real. if the target space dimension
is d = 2d/2, then the condition (6.3) is satised by d + 1 complex gamma matrices
(a)i
of these that can be chosen to be simultaneously real, then these can be used to

j satisfying the cliord algebra corresponding to o(d + 1). if m is the number

construct a realisation of n = m + 1 extended supersymmetry. for example, for

23

d = 2 there are 3 complex gamma matrices satisfying (6.2), which can be taken

to be a = ia for a = 1, 2, 3, but of these only i2 is real, so that m = 1 and

only n = 2 supersymmetry is possible. for d = 2, m = 1, for d = 4, m = 3,

for d = 8, m = 7 and it is clear that m can be made arbitrarily large by taking

d large enough. there are manifolds admitting cliord structures for arbitrarily

large values of m.

supersymmetry with any n can be realised on at space with c = 0 and

gij = ij. for given d, there are m real gamma matrices, and the transformation

corresponding to a given one will preserve the free action provided (6.4) are satised

with c = 0 and gij = ij, which will be the case if the corresponding gamma

matrix is anti-symmetric. for general geometries and general cliord structure,

the conditions become more and more restrictive the higher the value of n. there

are non-trivial examples for n = 8 [2], but it seems likely that for high enough n

the geometry will be required to be trivial. the n = 16 models considered in [2]

that arise for black hole moduli spaces have at target spaces.

given m = n  1 almost complex structures satisfying (6.2), the products

irs  iris =

1
2

[ir, is] = isr

(6.7)

are also almost complex structures, and further tensors can be formed by taking

anti-symmetrised products:

irs...t  iris...it = i[rs...t]

(6.8)

the tensors ir1...rn (with n  m) are almost complex structures (i 2 =  ) for

n = 4k + 1, 4k + 2 and are almost real structures or almost product structures
(i 2 =  ) for n = 4k, 4k + 3, where k = 1, 2, 3, .... these generate the enveloping

algebra of the cliord algebra. note that the set of all almost complex complex

structures constructed in this way do not satisfy a cliord algebra in general; for

24

example,

[ir, ist] = 2isrt  2itrs

(6.9)

consider the case of m = 3. there are three almost complex structures i, j, k

say, which anti-commute with each other and which each squares to  . if ij = k,

then they satisfy the quaternion algebra (4.4).

if not, then we can dene the

products

k = ij,

i = jk,

j = ki

(6.10)

each of which is an almost complex structure. moreover,

[i, i] = 0,

[j, j] = 0,

[k, k] = 0

(6.11)

and there are several subalgebras which are isomorphic to the quaternion algebra
(4.4), such as those generated by (i, j, k) or ( i, j, k). the i will play a role in

the following section.

in the case in which there are n complex structures which are simultaneously

integrable, i.e.

that can be simultaneously taken to be constant matrices in a

suitable coordinate system, then for n = 1, we have seen that the geometry is

determined by a 2-form potential, for n = 2 it is determined by a 1-form potential,

and that for the special case of n = 3 in which the complex structures satisfy a

quaternion algebra, by a 0-form potential. in the next section, we will generalise

this and show that for the general case of n = 3 the geometry is again determined
by a 0-form potential, and for higher n  3 it is given by a 0-form potential
satisfying certain dierential constraints.

in [5], the conditions for sigma-models with n supersymmetries to have super-

conformal supersymmetry were found for n = 1 and n = 2, and for n = 4 sigma-

models with complex structures satifying the su(2) algebra (4.4). these generalise

to give the corresponding conditions for any n, for an n-supersymmetric sigma-

model to be invariant under the superconformal group osp(n/1). the analysis is

similar to that in [5] and will be given elsewhere.

25

an extended superspace form of the sigma-model for general n can be given,
following [2]. let x be a map from the superspace with coordinates {t; 0, r, r =
1, . . . , n  1} into a ckt manifold m. then we impose the constraints

drx i = ir

i

jd0x j

(6.12)

where {d0, dr; r = 1, . . . , n  1} are the supersymmetry derivatives satisfying

d2

0 = i

d
dt

d0dr + drd0 = 0

dsdr + drds = 2irs

d
dt

.

(6.13)

these constraints are consistent provided (6.2),(6.3) are satised. an action for

this multiplet is

i = 

1

2z dtd0(cid:0)igijd0x i d

dt

x j +

1
3!

cijkd0x id0x jd0x k(cid:1) .

(6.14)

and will be independent of a and hence fully supersymmetric provided (6.4) are

satised.

6.2. n=2 superspace formulation

the models with n  2 supersymmetry can be written in n = 2 superspace
with action (3.18). it will prove useful to rewrite the action using the chiral con-
straint dz = 2dz as

i =

1

4z dt d2 ijdx idx j

(6.15)

where the antisymmetric tensor ij has components

 = b,

   = b  ,

  =   = ig 

(6.16)

so that the two-form  = 1

2 ijdx i  dx j is given by

 =  + b + b

(6.17)

where b = 1

2bdz  dzj. thus the geometry is specied by the choice of

26

an arbitrary real 2-form  potential, so that the model is dened by a complex
manifold with a 2-form, i.e. by the triple (m, i, ). the metric is dened by the
(1,1) part of  and b by the (2,0) part, and  is dened up to the transformations

(3.20)

   +  + 

where  is an arbitrary (1,0) form.

the action (6.15) can be expanded into n = 1 superspace to give

i =

1

4z dt d (cid:16)3ijkdx idx j dx k  2iij dx itx j(cid:17)

where ijk  [ij,k],

and the chiral constraint implies

d 

1
2i

(d  d)

dx i = i i

jdx j

using the notation of [23] that for any tensor tij...kl,

tij...kl = tij...kmi m

l

the action (6.19) can be rewritten as

i =

1

4z dt d (cid:16)3ijkdx idx jdx k  2iijdx itx j(cid:17)

the fact that, for any tensor ij,

(6.18)

(6.19)

(6.21)

(6.22)

(6.23)

z dt d ijdx itx j =z dt d (cid:18)(ij)dx itx j 

i

[ij,k]dx idx jdx k(cid:19)

(6.24)

27

can be used with ij = ij to rewrite the action (6.23) as

i =

1

4z dt d (cid:16)[3ijk  ij,k]dx idx jdx k  2i(ij)dx itx j(cid:17)

(6.25)

so that, comparing with (2.1), we have

gij = (ij) = k(ii k

j)

cijk =  3[3ijk  ij,k] = 3[i l

[ijk]l + 3[k(i l

ij]l]

in form notation, c is

c = i d +

1

di 

(6.26)

(6.27)

finally, note that for n > 2 supersymmetry with n  1 complex structures ir,
one can choose any one of them and work in the corresponding n = 2 superspace,
giving a 2-form r for that complex structure, and in this way one can construct
n  1 2-forms r
ij.

7. integrable complex structures and extended superspace

7.1. complex structures and clifford algebras

in this section we will examine the case in which there are m simultane-

ously integrable complex structures ia, each of which satises the conditions

(6.2),(6.3),(6.4) for n = m + 1 supersymmetry.

in such a case, there is a co-

ordinate choice in which the ia are all real constant matrices satisfying the cliord

algebra (6.2), and the superspace constraints become of the conventional kind.

the superspace action then leads to a simplication of the geometry (for example,

for n = 4 supersymmetry, the metric and torsion are given in terms of a scalar

potential l).

28

real d  d matrices satisfying (6.2) can be constructed from the basic real
2  2 matrices 1, 3,  = i2. for d = 2, the only real matrix satisfying (6.2) is ,
for d = 4 a set of three matrices ir (r = 1, 2, 3) satisfying (6.2) is given by

   ,

1  ,

3  

(7.1)

and these in fact satisfy the quaternion algebra (4.4). an alternative set ir is given
by

   ,

  1,

  3

(7.2)

and these two sets commute: [ir, is] = 0. for d = 8, a set of 7 matrices satisfying
(6.2) can be constructed from the ir, ir:

   ,

1  ir,

3  is

(7.3)

more generally, if for some d there are two commuting sets of cliord structures
ir, ir, r = 1, .., m for some m, a cliord structure for dimension 2d (i.e. with
2d  2d matrices) is given by the 2m + 1 matrices (7.3).

7.2. n=3 supersymmetry

in this case there are simultaneously integrable complex structures i, j and

the superspace constraints are

d1x i = i i

jdx j,

d2x i = j i

jdx j

(7.4)

with d = d0. the product k  ij is also a complex structure (as ij = ji), and
i, j, k satisfy the algebra of unit imaginary quaternions and are simultaneously
integrable. in general k will not satisfy the conditions (6.4) so that the action will

be invariant under the supersymmetry transformations corresponding to i and j
but not k.

29

the general form of the n = 3 action (with simultaneously integrable complex

structures) is given in terms of in terms of an arbitrary 1-form potential k by (5.13),

which can be rewritten as

i =

1

4z dt d0d1d2 kidx i

(7.5)

using the constraints (7.4). performing the 2 integral gives the n = 2 superspace

action

i =

1

2z dt d0d1 k[j,k]j k

idx idx j

so comparing with (6.15) gives

where kij = 2k[i,j], or

ij = j k

[ikj]k

 = 2j dk

the metric and torsion are then given by (6.26), so that

gij = kk(i

kk

j) + i k

(ij l

j)kkl

(7.6)

(7.7)

(7.8)

(7.9)

the condition for the complex structure k to give a fourth supersymmetry is that

d kk = 0

so that locally there is a scalar l such that

as will be seen in the next section.

ki = kj

ijl

30

(7.10)

(7.11)

7.3. n=4 supersymmetry

in this case there are simultaneously integrable complex structures i, j, k and

the superspace constraints are

d1x i = i i

jdx j,

d2x i = j i

jdx j,

d3x i = ki

jdx j

(7.12)

the case in which ij = k and i, j, k satisfy the algebra of unit imaginary quater-

nions has been analysed in section 4.3. here we will not assume this, so that in

general there are three additional complex structures dened by the products

k = ij,

i = jk,

j = ki

(7.13)

and there is a real structure (r2 =  )

r = ijk

(7.14)

if the complex structures satisfy (4.4), the dimension is d = 4n for some n and the
complex structures can be taken to be ir   
n where ir are the 4  4 real matrices
(7.1) and  
n is the n  n identity matrix. if the complex structures do not satisfy
(4.4), the dimension is d = 8n for some n and the complex structures can be taken

to be

      ,

1     ,

3     

(7.15)

in the coordinate system in which the complex structures are all constant, the

general form of the n = 4 superspace action is

i =

1

4z dt d0d1d2d3 l(x)

(7.16)

for some potential l. performing the 3 integral gives the n = 3 superspace action

i =

1

4z dt d0d1d2 l,j kj

idx i

31

(7.17)

which is of the same form as (7.5), with the 1-form potential given by

or

ki = l,j kj

i

k = k dl

so that the geometry 2-form is given by

 = 2j d(k dl)

then the metric and torsion are given by (6.26). dening

this gives

7.4. n>4 supersymmetry

for any model with n  4 supersymmetry and simultaneously integrable com-
plex structures, the action can be written in the n = 4 superspace corresponding

to any three complex structures in terms of a scalar potential (with dierent po-

tentials for dierent sets of three). if any three of the complex structures satisfy

the quaternion algebra (4.4), then the geometry must be weak hkt and there can
be no more than 4 supersymmetries unless the holonomy of the connection (+) is

trivial. for n > 4, the action can be written in full extended superspace in a same

way similar to that used in [8], giving an explicit expression for the potential l

as a multiple contour integral. alternatively, the conditions for the n = 4 action

to have further supersymmetries leads to dierential constraints on l (similar to

those in [8], the general solution of which is given by the multiple contour integral

expression. details will be given elsewhere.
