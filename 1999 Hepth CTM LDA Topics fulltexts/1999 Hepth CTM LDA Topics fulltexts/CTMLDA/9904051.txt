(2.14) compute time component metric, turns cannot demand torsion-free condition components torsion. understand property torsion better, utilize full bps monopole nd nite r behavior. fact, general torsion vanish nite r. shall rst check behavior b, turn let us know torsion. reasonable demand spatial component b vanishes asymptotically energy associated b nite, reason demand behavior time component b. particular, ba 0i never vanishes nite r. however, since information b moment, take compromised position. following shall demand spatial part torsion vanishes everywhere, leave time component arbitrary. way, still obtain spatial part metric eq.(2.12). eq.(2.12) solved bps monopole, eq.(2.9), obtain e2 = 1 2 mr2 tanh2 mr 2 . time component metric derived ba 0i follows. let ua 0 2 mxaf (r), ba 0i = mf (r) 2 +iab xb r3 tanh mr 2 mr tanh mr mr sinh mr 2 f(r) + 1 r2 1 mr sinh mr! f (r)! r mxixa 1 1! . demand ba 0i < r , general f (r) = c(mr)n, (n 0), (2.15) (2.16) (2.17) (2.18) c constant. n chosen integer asymptotic behavior consistent last term ba 0i. choice also let us avoid later unnecessary branch cuts projected onto two-dimensional surface wilson loop propagation. also demand ua 0 < 0. eqs.(2.8)(2.9) well behaved limit. result, allowed n n = 0, 1, 2. 4 n = 0, ba 0i vanish asymptotically: n = 0 : ba 0i c2 xixa r2 + iabm xb r2 c2 xixa r2 . n = 1, 2, n = 1, 2 : ba 0i iabm xb r2 0.
