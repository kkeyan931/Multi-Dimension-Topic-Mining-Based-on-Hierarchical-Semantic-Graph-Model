abstract

we present a self-contained formulation of the nonlinear schrodinger

hierarchy and its yangian symmetry in terms of deformed oscilator
algebra (z.f. algebra). the link between yangian y (gln ) and nite
w (glpn , n.glp) algebras is also illustrated in this framework.

the present text is a summary of the original work [1], done in collabo-
ration with m. mintchev, p. sorba and ph. zaugg. the proofs and detailed
calculations can be found there, as well as a more precise bibliography.

1 the nls equation

we start with the n-vectorial version of the non linear schrodinger equation
(nls) in 1+1 dimension, on the real line:

i

(x, t)

t

+

2
2x

= 2g (  ) with  =

1
2
...
n



(1.1)

where j are complex elds, and the coupling constant g is chosen real and
negative (repulsive case). the corresponding hamiltonian is given by

h =z dx i

x

i
x

+ gijij! ,

(1.2)

the solution is given by a series expansion in powers of g:

()
1
()
2
...
()

n





(x, t) =

x=0

(g)()(x, t) where () =

j0 (x, t) = z d+1 d

ei

q
j=1(j  j  i)(j  j1  i)
xj=1
(xj  t2
j )

(1.3)

(1.4)

this solution is valid for the classical case [2] (as are then arbitrary functions)
as well as for the quantum case [3], where in that case a() and a() generate
a deformed oscillator algebra (or zf algebra [4]):

ai()aj() = rlk

()aj
() = ak
() = ak
ai()aj

kl(  )
()rjl

note that the indices i, j, . . . run from 1 to n, because the vector  is in the
fundamental representation of sl(n). in the quantum case, the constructed
elds obey canonical commutation relations:

[j(x, t), k(y, t)] = 0
[j(x, t), k(y, t)] = k

j (x  y)

; [j(x, t), k(y, t)] = 0

(1.8)

the r-matrix appearing in this algebra is just the one of y (sl(n)). this
is not surprising, since y (sl(n)) is a symmetry of nls. in fact, it has been
shown in [5] that, for n = 2, the yangian generators can be expressed in
term of  and pauli matrices ta:

j a = z dx (x)ta(x)

sa =

i

2z dx (x)tax(x) 

ig

2 z dxdy sgn(y  x)(cid:16)(x)ta(y)(cid:17) (x)  (y)

where j a and sa stand for the yangian generators qa
presentation of the yangians [6].

2 the nls hierarchy

the yangian symmetry of the nsl equation (and in fact of its whole hier-
archy) is nicely formulated using the quantum inverse scattering method
(qism).

we start with the lax operator of the qism

l(x|) = i

and look at the quantum monodromy matrix t (x, y|), dened by the equa-
tions


x

t (x, y|) = : l(x|)t (x, y|) :,

t (x, y|)|x=y = in +1,

(2.12)

2

where in +1 is the identity matrix. the innite volume monodromy matrix
t () is then formally dened by

lim

t () =

x,y

e(x|)t (x, y|)e(y|), where e(x|) = exp(ix/2).
the commutation relations of t () are computed using the canonical com-
mutators of the s and are encoded in the exchange relation
r+(  ) t ()  t () = t ()  t () r(  )

where the latin (resp. greek) indices run from 1 to n (resp. n + 1), and
eab is the (n + 1)  (n + 1) matrix with 1 at position (a, b). the term i0 is
a consequence of the principal value regularisation adopted when  goes to
zero.

it will be convenient to rename some elements of the monodromy matrix
such as d() = tn +1,n +1() and bj() = tn +1,j(). further examination of
some components of (2.13) yields the following relations

d()d() = d()d(),
   + ig
   + i0

d()bj() =

bj()bk() =

  

    ig

bj()d(),

bk()bj() 

ig

    ig

(2.15)

(2.16)

bj()bk(). (2.17)

the matrix element d() serves as a generating operator-function for the

consequently, eq. (2.15) implies that the h(n)s are all in involution. indeed,

commuting integrals of motion of the nls model: d() = 1+pn=0 h(n)n1.
one can compute that h(0) is proportional to r dx jj (particle number
operator), h(1) to (up to h(0) terms) ir dx jj (momentum) and h(2) is

the nls hamiltonian. the other h(n)s (n > 2) dene higher hamiltonians
which dene the nls hierarchy. the operators bj() just correspond to the
creation operators of the zf algebra previously mentionned. more precisely,
g bj()d1(), and the commutation relations (2.16-2.17)
one has aj() = i
ensure the right exchange relation for the aj()s. the operators aj() are
the adjoint operators of these aj()s.

finally, considering t (), the n  n submatrix of t (), and examining

the appropriate components of (2.13), one deduces the following relations

with yet another r-matrix

er(  ) t ()  t () = t ()  t () er(  )
er(  ) = (  )ejk  ekj  igin  in .

(2.18)

(2.19)

this coincides precisely with the dening relation of the yangian y (gln ).

the fact that the yangian algebra commutes with the hamiltonians of
the nls hierarchy is a consequence of the exchange relation as well, since
one extracts from (2.13) that

[ tij(), d()] = 0

(2.20)

3 z.f. formulation

the two previous sections have both made appear the zf algebra: the former
as a building bock for the quantum solutions of the nls equation, and
the latter as the remains of the matrix t () when one has picked up the
yangian t () and the hamiltonians d().
it is thus natural to wonder
whether this zf algebra can be the central element of the nls hierarchy and
of its symmetry. indeed, since the eld  is built on it and as the yangian
generators are constructed on  (at least for n = 2), one could think that the
task is not hard. however,  is given as a series expansion in as and as, and
the yangian generators are polynomial in , so that a direct calculation is
almost impossible. alternatively, we construct operators which have the right
commutation relations with the as and as: since the fock space spanned
by these latter is dense in the hilbert space of the nls model, this will be
enough to identify the operators.

3.1 hamiltonians of the hierarchy

we introduce the operators

h(n) =z d naj()aj()

(3.21)

using the relations (1.5-1.7), it is easy to show that

[ h(n), aj()] = naj()

;

[ h(n), aj()] = naj()

(3.22)

4

which is just the denition of the hamiltonians in the quantum nls hierar-
chy.

thanks to the simple expression (3.21), it is easy to deduce the general
solution to the nls hierarchy. in fact, the local elds  which has a time
evolution given by the hamiltonian h(n)  h(n) have the same expansion
(1.3) with now

(n)

xj=0
(xj  tn

j ) 

xj=1
(xj  tn

3.2 yangian generators

in the same way, we dene the operators

j a =

()+1

x=1

and sa =

()+1

() = z d aj1(1)aj2(2) ..aj() ( t a)k1k2...k

j1j2...j ak() ..ak1(1)(3.25)

j1j2...j ak() ..ak1(1)(3.26)

the tensor t a is given by

(t a)k1k2...k

j1j2...j =

()m1    1
xm=1

m  1! (ta)km

jm k1

j1 . . . km1

jm1 km+1

jm+1 . . . k
j .

(3.27)

where ta are the generators of sln in the fundamental representation ([ta, tb] =
if ab

c tc). with this form, j a satises

[j a, ak()] = (a()ta)k,

c j c
similarly, omitting the obvious jr

[j a, j b] = if ab

kr symbols, we write

[j a, ak()] = (taa())k

(3.28)

which are the required commutators for the yangian generators qa

0 and qa
1.
note that the yangian generators are dened through a series expansion,
not in the coupling constant, but rather in the number of creation operators
a. in the case of the  elds, these two types of series indeed coincide.

let us also remark that the form (3.25-3.26) clearly shows (using the
relations (3.22)) that j a and sa commute with the hamiltonians h(n), so
that the yangian is a manifest symmetry of the whole nls hierarchy.

4 fock space and nite w (glpn, n.glp) algebras

it is now known [7] that there is an algebra homomorphism between the
yangian y (gln ) and the nite w (glpn , n.glp) algebras (for any p). this
links can be illustrated in the framework of nls hierarchy, using the zf
algebra.

indeed, if one considers the fock space f spanned by the as, it is easy
to see that it is built on subspaces fp with xed particle number (ie number
of a). since the yangian generators commute with the particle number
operator, one can consider their restriction to fp. in that case, the series
expansion dening the yangian generators troncates at level p, and we are
left with a polynomial (nite dimensional) algebra. this algebra is nothing
but the w (glpn, n.glp) algebra (in a special representation).

thus, while on the full space f we have the complete yangian symmetry,
on each subspace fp the yangian troncates to a nite w (glpn, n.glp) algebra
which leaves fp (globally) invariant.
