abstract

we write a 3d equation for three fermions by combining the three two-body potentials obtained in 3d
reductions (based on a series expansion around a relative-energy xing approximation of the free
propagators) of the corresponding two-fermion bethe-salpeter equations to equivalent 3d equations,
putting the third fermion on its positive-energy mass shell. in this way, the cluster-separated limits
are exact, and the lorentz invariance / cluster separability requirement is automatically satised,
provided no supplementary approximation, like the born approximation, is made. the use of positive
free-energy projectors in the chosen reductions of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equations prevents
continuum dissolution in our 3d three-fermion equation. the potentials are hermitian below the
inelastic threshold and depend only slowly on the total three-fermion energy. the one high-mass
limits are approximately exact.

this hand-made three-fermion 3d equation is also obtained by starting with an approximation
of the three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation, in which the three-body kernel is neglected and the two-
body kernels approached by positive-energy instantaneous expressions, with the spectator fermion on
the mass shell. the neglected terms are then transformed into corrections to the 3d equation, in
three steps implying each a series expansion. the result is of course complicated, but the lowest-order
contributions of these correction terms to the energy spectrum remain manageable.

we also present some other 3d reduction procedures and compare them to ours: use of sazdjians
covariant approximation of the free propagator, 3d reductions performed by a series expansion around
instantaneous approximations of the kernels instead of approximations of the propagators, gross
spectator model.

in the treatment of the three-body problem, there is a large gap between nonrelativistic quantum mechan-
ics (schrodinger equation) and relativistic quantum eld theory (bethe-salpeter equation [1, 2]). starting
from the schrodinger equation one can of course replace the free part of the hamiltonian by its relativistic
form. starting from the bethe-salpeter equation, one can try to eliminate the two relative time variables
to get nally a schrodinger equation with a compact potential plus a lot of correction terms of various
origins. instead of the schrodinger equation, one can use the faddeev equations. these equations can
be derived from the schrodinger equation, or, in a more general form, from the bethe-salpeter equation.
faddeev equations for the transition operator give the various scattering and reaction matrix elements
and the poles (to be computed by basically nonperturbative methods) of this operator in the total energy
give the spectrum of the three-body bound states.

schrodingers equation is relatively easy to solve, but this zero-order approximation does not reect
several important properties and symmetries of the studied physical system. these could be recovered,
in principle, by incorporating higher-order contributions (in general an innity of them).

as an intermediate step between nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and quantum eld theory we
shall search for a 3d equation built with the sum of the relativistic free hamiltonians plus two-body
and perhaps also three-body interaction potentials. such equations are closely related to the systems
of coupled dirac or klein-gordon equations of constraint theory [3-7], which are still 4d equations but
exhibit a simplied dependence in the relative times, which could be completely eliminated to get a single

2

3d equation. our 3d equation will be a strategic link in a chain of approximations between a manageable
equation (such as schrodingers equation) and a full 3d equivalent (at least for what concerns the bound
states spectrum) of the original bethe-salpeter equation. we shall try to keep a maximum of properties
and symmetries of the original bethe-salpeter equation in our 3d equation. for the properties which
we shall be unable to satisfy exactly in our 3d equation, we expect that the inclusion of higher-order
correction terms will progressively improve the situation. we shall thus try to make our 3d equation
satisfy the following list of requirements:

 correct nonrelativistic limit.
 lorentz invariance and cluster separability. it is always possible to render an equation lorentz
invariant by working in the general rest frame (center of mass reference frame) and by building invariants
with the total 4-momentum vector, although the result may be unelegant and articial. the lorentz
invariance requirement becomes a tool when combined with the cluster separability requirement: when
all mutual interactions are switched o, we must get a set of three free dirac equations. this total
separability can easily be obtained by using as hamiltonian the sum of three free dirac hamiltonians and
interaction terms. the real diculty appears when only the interactions with fermion 3 (for example)
are switched o. if we want a full cluster separability, the resulting equation for the (12) cluster can not
refer to the global center of mass frame anymore, as the momentum of fermion 3 enters in the denition
of this frame.

lorentz invariance and cluster separability can be explicit or implicit (via rearrangements). the best
known example of implicit lorentz invariance is a free dirac equation solved with respect to the energy:
it becomes explicitly covariant by multiplication with the  matrix. other implicit lorentz invariances
are not that trivial. for example, the 3d reductions of a bethe-salpeter equation are implicitly covariant,
provided the series generated by this reduction is not truncated.

in fact, the homogeneous bethe-salpeter equation from which we shall start does not obey cluster
separability: this equation is valid for three-fermion bound states only, i.e. for a total energy below all
the continua. our 3d equation will thus be used in the computation of three-fermion bound states. a
priori, it will not necessarily give also the correct scattering amplitudes or obey cluster separability, even
with all higher-order terms included. we shall nevertheless try to get a 3d equation which is also valid
in the continuum region.

 hermiticity and total energy independence of the interaction terms. in the two-body problem,
nonhermitian interaction terms can be hermitian with respect to a modied scalar product, or made
hermitian via a rearrangement of the equation. in the three-body problem these rearrangements could be
more complicated. the hermiticity and the independence on the total energy are linked features, as one
of these is often achieved at the expense of the other one. energy depending interaction terms destroy
some of the advantages of the use of an hermitian hamiltonian, such as the mutual orthogonality of the
solutions, and leads to modify the usual perturbation calculation methods. the 3d potentials deduced
from eld theory are generally energy dependent, at least in the higher-order terms. we shall require
hermiticity and energy-independence (or slow energy dependence) below the inelastic threshold in the
lowest order terms at least.

 correct heavy mass limits. when the mass of one of the fermions becomes innite, its presence must
be translated in the equations by a potential (coulombian in qed) acting on the other fermions. for the
two-body problem the one-body limit in qed is indeed a dirac-coulomb equation or a rearrangement
of it (for example when a projection operator is introduced in order to avoid continuum dissolution - see
below). in the dirac-coulomb equation, the coulomb potential is already given by the limit of the born
term, as the higher-order crossed and ladder terms cancel mutually at the one-body limit. in contrast,
the one-body limits of the rearrangements contain contributions from all terms [8-12].

 perturbative approach. it must be possible to start with a manageable approximate equation and
indenitely improve the approximation of the measurable quantities (with respect to the uncalculated
predictions of the here assumed exact bethe-salpeter equation) by adding higher-order contributions.

 solution of the continuum dissolution problem. in the relativistic equations for several relativistic
particles, the physical bound states are degenerate with a continuum of states combining asymptotically
free particles with opposite energy signs. this often neglected fact forbids the building of normalizable
solutions in the n > 2-body problem (including the two-body plus potential problem. in the pure two-
body problem the mixing is prevented by the conservation of the total momentum). the usual solution
consists in including positive-energy projection operators into the zero-order propagator [13-16]. the
modied equations must of course continue to satisfy the other requirements, like the lorentz invariance

3

/ cluster separability requirement.

among these requirements, the absence of continuum dissolution is a technical necessity, if we want
to get normalizable bound states. the correct nonrelativistic limit is of course a must. the possibility
of improving the chosen approximation could enable us to estimate the precision of this approximation
and possibly to satisfy the other requirements up to the considered order at least.

section 2 is devoted to the two-fermion problem, revisited in order to dene the notations and present
the building blocks and cluster-separated limits of our future three-fermion equations.
in section 3
we write directly a cluster separable 3d equation, by combining the relativistic free hamiltonians and
the 3d potentials obtained in the reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equations, putting in
each 3d potential the third fermion on the mass shell. switching o two of the three mutual interaction
potentials gives then a free dirac equation for a spectator fermion plus the two-body equation which would
be obtained directly by 3d-reducing the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation, for the two interacting
fermions. this insures the lorentz invariance / cluster separability property. positive-energy projectors
solve the continuum dissolution problem. our 3d equation can also be obtained from the three-fermion
bethe-salpeter equation, by neglecting the three-body kernel and replacing the two-body kernels by
positive-energy instantaneous (i.e. independent of the relative energies) approximations, equivalent at the
cluster-separated limits. the remaining dependence (in the free propagators) of the approximated bethe-
salpeter equation in the relative energies can then be eliminated by performing closed path integrals. this
derivation of our 3d equation from an approximated bethe-salpeter equation enabled us to transform the
neglected terms, known at the bethe-salpeter equation level, into correction terms to the 3d equation.
we achieved this by performing three consecutive expansions of the correction terms: the three-fermion
bethe-salpeter equation is rst transformed into a set of three coupled equations for three wave functions
depending each on one two-fermion total energy, then into a set of three 3d equations and nally into a
single 3d equation. the resulting expression for the 3d equation is rather complicated, as it combines
three series expansions, but we use it to write a manageable expression of the rst-order corrections to
the energy spectrum. the contributions of the residues of the poles of the propagators to this energy
shift are easy to compute in terms of the bethe-salpeter kernels with two of the three fermions on their
mass shell, in the spirit of gross spectator model [17, 18]. besides, we have also the contributions of
the singularities of the kernels themselves to the closed path integrals. these contributions can not be
a priori neglected. in section 4, we examine some other possible choices of the approximation of the
free propagator, including sazdjians covariant propagator [6, 12, 19]. in combination with a covariant
substitute of the projector on the positive free-energy states, this propagator leads to a 3d potential given
by a series in which each term is separately covariant, so that we can truncate the series without breaking
the covariance. in section 5, we examine an alternative 3d reduction method built around instantaneous
approximations of the bethe-salpeter kernels. the non-hermitian resulting 3d potential can be made
hermitian either by performing a second series expansion, easily combinable with the series expansion
generated by the 3d reduction, or by adaptating the starting approximation of the bethe-salpeter kernel
(phillips and wallaces method [20]). it is interesting to note that phillips and wallaces method and the
propagator-based 3d reduction method give both the correct scattering operator (a bonus not implied by
the starting homogeneous bethe-salpeter equation, designed for bound states), while the ordinary kernel-
based 3d reduction does not. section 6 is devoted to a comparison of our hand-made 3d equation
with gross spectator models equations [17, 18] in faddeevs formalism. in this model, the dependence
of the two-fermion transition operators in the relative energies is taken into account by putting dierent
fermions on their positive-energy mass shells, according to the neighbours of each two-fermion transition
operator in the expansion giving the three-fermion transition operator. each of our two-fermion transition
operators is everywhere approximated in the same way, so that our faddeev equations are much simpler
and can be transformated into our wave equation. the dierence between both models corresponds to
higher-order contributions, which we recover in our calculation of the higher-order terms, together with
the supplementary contributions, not to be a priori neglected, of the singularities of the kernels to the
closed path integrals in the relative energies complex planes. in section 7, we compare the one-high mass
limits (two-body limits) of our three-fermion equation with our previous two-fermion in an external
potential equation [16]. section 8 is devoted to conclusions.

2.1 notations.

we shall write the bethe-salpeter equation for the bound states of two fermions [1] as

 = g0k,

(1)

where  is the bethe-salpeter amplitude, function of the positions x1, x2 or of the momenta p1, p2 of the
fermions, according to the representation chosen. the operator k is the bethe-salpeter kernel, given
as a factor of the kernel of an integral equation in momentum space by the sum of the irreducible two-
fermion feynman graphs. the operator g0 is the free propagator, given by the product g0
2 of the two
individual fermion propagators

where the hi are the dirac free hamiltonians

hi = ~i .~pi + i mi

(i = 1, 2).

(2)

(3)

the bethe-salpeter kernel k should contain charge renormalization and vacuum polarization graphs,
while the propagators g0
i should contain self-energy terms (which can be transferred to k [19, 21] ]).
in this work, we consider only the free fermion propagators in g0
i and the skeleton graphs in k, and
we hope that the inclusion of the various corrections would not change our conclusions.
we shall dene the total (or external, cm, global) and relative (or internal) variables:

x =

1
2

(x1 + x2) ,

p = p1 + p2 ,

x = x1  x2 ,

p =

1
2

(p1  p2).

and give a name to the corresponding combinations of the free hamiltonians:

s = h1 + h2 ,

s =

1
2

(h1  h2).

we know that, at the no-interaction limit, the system is described by a pair of free dirac equations:

where  depends on x1, x2. let us also write their iterated version

(p10  h1) = 0,

(p20  h2) = 0,

(p2

10  e2

1 ) = 0,

(p2

20  e2

interesting combinations can be obtained from the sum and dierences of the equations (7) or of the
iterated equations (8):

(p0  s) = 0,

(p0  s) = 0,

h 0 = 0,

(p0  ) = 0

h 0 = 2[(p2

p0

.

the choice (4,5) of the variables x and p was partially arbitrary: other linear combinations are possible,
provided the canonical commutation relations are satised. in the nonrelativistic framework, the choice of
~x is weighted by the masses, and ~p is chosen accordingly. a frequent choice in the relativistic framework
is a weighting by the free energies, which leads to a simpler complementary equation p0 = 0 instead

5

of (11), but has the drawback that the coecients of the weighting are not constant. we think that our
choice (4,5) leads to simpler expressions, even if taking the nonrelativistic limit is less straightforward.

our free equations (10) are eigenvalue equations, the energies p0 and p0 being the eigenvalues and
s and s the corresponding operators. equation (11) with h 0 is a fourth-order equation in p0, with
four solution for a given set of values of the spatial momenta. equation (11) with p0 is the eigenvalue
equation of an operator , depending itself on p0. in the bethe-salpeter equation (1), p0 remains a
constant, but p0 becomes an operator in position space, or a variable in momentum space. the 3d
reduction will consist in eliminating this variable by performing an expansion around a xed combination
of the other ones ( s or  in the following).

2.2 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation.

in the zero-order approximation, the free propagator g0 will be replaced by a carefully chosen expression
g, combining a constraint like (p0  ) xing the relative energy, and a global 3d propagator like
2i(p0 s)112. the argument of the  and the inverse of the propagator should be combinations
of the operators used in the free equations (at last approximately and for the positive-energy solutions).
there exists an innity of possible combinations [8, 12, 20, 22-34]. the best choice depends on the
quantities one wants to compute (energy of the lowest state, hyperne splitting, recoil of a nucleus, etc...)
and on the properties one wants to preserve exactly in the rst approximation (cluster separability,
lorentz invariance, heavy mass limits, charge conjugation symmetry...). all choices would be equivalent
if all correction terms could be computed, but this is of course impossible.

we shall see below that the reduced wave function  (from which the relative time-energy degree of

freedom can be trivially eliminated) is given by

 = g(g0)1.

(14)

the choice of the constraint xes the 3d hypersurface (p0 =  for example) on which we want to work.
the remaining of g is a purely 3d operator, the dierent choices of which result in dierent 3d operators
applied on a common basic 3d wave function and in dierent rearrangements of a common reduction
series giving the 3d potential. the various propagator-based 3d reductions of the literature can thus be
classied according to the constraint they use. once this constraint chosen, we can only write dierent
equivalent forms (or sometimes projections) of the same 3d equation. it is the unavoidable truncation
of the reduction series which makes the dierence (numeric, if we simply want to compute predictions
of eld theory; more fundamental, if we want to write constraint theory equations with qcd inspired
potentials).

two natural choices for the constraint are (p0s), based on the rst-order equations (10) and (p0),
based on the second-order equations (11). in (p0  s), s is an operator which can be diagonalized in
momentum space using the four projectors on the subspaces corresponding to the dierent signs of h1, h2
(see below). by contrast,  is a momentum-depending number, which reduces to (m2
2)/2p0 in the
two-fermion center of mass frame ~p = 0 which can be dened in the pure two-fermion problem (but not
in the two-fermion plus potential problem or in the three-fermion problem). other constraints could also
be chosen, such as that of gross [8], which puts one particle (normally the heaviest) on its mass shell.
we made a nonexhaustive review in ref. [12].

if we consider the contributions of the poles of

g0 =

1
2 p0 + p0  h1 + ih1

1
2 p0  p0  h2 + ih2

12

(15)

in an expression like kg0k, we must perform an integration with respect to p0. if k is instantaneous,
we get

where

can also be written

z dp0g0(p0) = 2i g0 12,

g0 =

(16)

(17)

(18)

when k is not instantaneous, we must add the contributions of its singularities. furthermore, in the
residues of the poles of g0 we must take k at p10 = h1 or at p20 = h2, according to the chosen integration
path and to the sign of . in order to preserve an explicit symmetry between the two fermions, we shall
use the constraint (p0 s), to be combined with g0 :

gs(p0) = 2i  (p0 s) g0 12.

(19)

the operator  has a clear meaning in the basis built with the free solutions: it is +1 for h1, h2 > 0, -1
for h1, h2 < 0 and zero when they have opposite signs. it comes from the dependence of the p0 integral
on the signs of the ihi.

the choice g = gs has two merits: a) it leads directly to salpeters equation without higher-
order correction terms to the potential when the bethe-salpeter kernel is instantaneous. b) in the two-
fermion plus potential problem and in the three-fermion problem, the operator  prevents the mixing of
asymptotically free fermions with opposite energy signs, which is the origin of the continuum dissolution
problem (see section 4 below). in order to reduce the number of terms at lowest order, we shall however
keep only the ++ part of  and choose

g(p0) = gp (p0) = 2i ++ (p0s) g0 12.

we shall examine some other possible choices in section 4.

let us now write the free propagator as the sum of the zero-order propagator, plus a remainder:

g0 = g + gr.

the bethe-salpeter equation becomes then the inhomogeneous equation

 = g0k = (g + gr)k =  + grk,

with

 = gk

(= g(g0)1).

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

solving (formally) the inhomogeneous equation (22) with respect to  and putting the result into (23),
we get

where

obeys

 = gk(1  grk)1 = gk t 

k t = k(1  grk)1 = k + kgrk + ... = (1  kgr)1k

k t = k + kgrk t = k + k t grk.

(24)

(25)

(26)

the reduction series (25) re-introduces in fact the reducible graphs into the bethe-salpeter kernel, but
with g0 replaced by gr. equation (24) is a 3d equivalent of the bethe-salpeter equation.

the relative energy dependence of eq. (24) can be easily eliminated:

 = (p0 s) 

and  obeys:

 = 2i g0 ++ z dp

using the identity  = ++, we can write

0dp0(p

0 s)12k t (p

0, p0)(p0 s) .

 = g0 v ,

v = 2i 12k t ++(s, s),

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

12k t ++(s, s)  ++z dp

0dp0(p

0 s)12k t (p

0, p0)(p0 s) ++.

note that we write (p
0, p0) but (s, s), as we keep s in operator form. this operator can be diagonalized
in the spatial momentum space by using the ij projectors. the eigenvalue will depend on the position
of s in the formula: the eigenvalue of the rst s in (30) will be built with the nal momenta and that
of the last s will be built with the initial momenta.

7

the inversion of the reduction is given by

 = ( 1  grk )1  = ( 1 + grk t )  = ( 1 + g0k t  g k t )  = g0k t 

(31)

or, explicitating the relative energy:

(p

0, s) .

0) = g0(p

0) k t (p

(32)

the splitting of g0 into two terms containing a  is the origin of unphysical singularities in the
terms of k t when the argument of the delta vanishes on the singularities of k. when the full k t is
computed, the singularities of the dierent terms cancel mutually. when k t is truncated, some of the
unphysical singularities have to be removed by hand [8, 17].

this 3d reduction can also be described in terms of transition operators. the 4d transition operator

is

t = k + k g0 k +   

and k t can be obtained by keeping only the gr part of g0 in it. we have also

t = k(1g0k)1 = k(1grk gk)1 = k(1grk)1(1gk(1grk)1)1

= k t (1gk t )1 = k t + k t gk t +   

so that the 3d transition operator

is also given by

t 3d = v + v g0 v +   

t 3d = 2i 12 t ++(s, s).

(33)

(34)

(35)

we see that the 3d transition operator is a constrained form of that of eld theory. both operators
become equal to the physical scattering amplitude when both fermions are on their positive-energy mass
shells. this was not guaranteed a priori, as our original two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation (1) was
valid only for bound states. our 3d equation (29) is a bound state equation too. to include the scattering
states we should add an inhomogeneous term, or write the equation in the form

(p0  e1  e2 )  = v .

conversely:

t = k t + k t gk t + k t g(k t + k t gk t +   )gk t

= k t + k t gk t + k t g 1
2i

12 t 3dgk t .

(37)

(38)

a bethe-salpeter equation leading directly to the same 3d reduction can be obtained by replacing the
kernel k by the instantaneous positive-energy kernel k t ++(s, s). in this case the 4d transition operator
t becomes equal to t ++(s, s) = 12 t 3d/2i.

in contrast with the textbook cases, the potentials deduced from eld theory are in general energy-
dependent (although one starts often with an energy-independent approximation). we shall thus get a
set of eigenvalues w (p0) corresponding to mutually orthogonal eigenstates (p0) of the hamiltonian.
the physical energy spectrum will be given by the solutions of the algebric equations

p0 = w  (p0)

(39)

and the corresponding wave functions are no more orthogonal with the the usual scalar product, as they
are no more eigenstates of the same hamiltonian. the usual methods of perturbation calculation are to
be revisited [35].
the rst-order correction term to the energy is

p0  p (0)

0 = 2i < ++ 12 (kgrk)(s, s) ++ > .

(40)

since p (0)
, (kgrk)(s, s) and the zero-order wave functions are in general total energy dependent,
(40) is in fact a numerical equation in p0 (or a matricial equation in case of degeneracy). if the p0

0

8

dependence of the zero-order potential is of higher-order, one has only to take the p0 dependence of
p (0)
0

into account.

what is lost in our 3d equation compared with the starting bethe-salpeter equation? the missing
information is given by equation (32), which gives the bound state solutions of the bethe-salpeter equation
in terms of the corresponding solutions of the 3d equation by adding the dependence in the relative
energy. furthermore, the transition operators are the same on the positive-energy mass shells, although
the homogeneous bethe-salpeter equation was originally deduced from the inhomogeneous bethe-salpeter
equation (for the propagators) by postulating a bound state [1]. were some bound states lost in the 3d
reduction, like the abnormal solutions related to excitations in the relative time degree of freedom?
we have studied this still open problem elsewhere. our conclusions were: 1). the abnormal solutions
of the bethe-salpeter equation, when they exist, can also be obtained in the 3d equation via the total
energy dependence of the potential, leading to multiple solutions of (39) for each value of  [36, 37]. 2).
the abnormal solutions found until now are artefacts due to the ladder approximation, and should not
appear when all crossed graphs are included [37, 38].

3 the three-fermion problem.

3.1 a cluster-separable three-fermion 3d equation.

in the three-fermion framework, we shall append indices (ij)=(12),(23),(31) to the two-fermion symbols
and write pij , kij, etc.... the index k=1,2,3 will denote the third fermion. some of these symbols will
also get a new three-fermion meaning when left unindexed, such as

p = p1 + p2 + p3,

s = h1 + h2 + h3.

(41)

a cluster-separable three-fermion 3d equation can be obtained by combining three two-fermion potentials
(29):

 =

( v12 + v23 + v31)

(42)

1

p0  s

given by our 3d reduction in the two-fermion framework. the potential v given by (29) depended on the
total two-fermion energy p0 which we did not wrote as an argument, because it was conserved. when
using these two-fermion potentials in the three-fermion framework, we shall replace the now nonconserved
two-fermion energy argument pij0 by the operator pij0 + (pk0  hk) = p0  hk, which is the dierence
between the conserved three-body energy and the free energy of the third fermion. the potential vij
is thus no more strictly a two-fermion term, and the third fermion is no more strictly a spectator when
there are interactions between the cluster (ij) and the fermion k. at the (ij)+k cluster-separated limit,
however, the fermion k will be free and p0 hk will be replaced in vij by the now conserved pij0. let
us indeed switch o the potentials v 0
31 in equation (42). this equation can then be splitted
into

23 and v 0

 = 123,
1

p0 = p120 + p30,

12 =

p120  e1  e2

v12(p120) 12,

(p30  h3) 3 = 0,

(43)

(44)

i.e. equation (29) for the (12) subsystem and a free dirac equation for fermion 3. our 3d equation (42)
satises thus clearly the cluster separability requirement. furthermore, the three cluster-separated limits
are exact equivalents of the corresponding two-fermion bethe-salpeter equations. this cluster separability
is a property of the equation, or, more exactly, of the full green function. for a given scattering solution
it is also possible to take the cluster-separated limit at xed p. this is not possible for the bound state
solutions.

in replacing pij0 by p0 hk we exploit the fact that the opposite cluster is at the cluster-separated
limit a free fermion. with four fermions, we should introduce, for exemple, a potential v34 inside a
potential v12 and vice-versa, getting an unmanageable innite nesting of potentials. this limits our
recipe to the case of three fermions.

our two and three-fermion equations were written until now in an unspecied reference frame. we

shall consider three possible answers to the covariance challenge:

 write explicitly covariant equations. this is not the case ou our two and three-fermion 3d equations,
built around non-covariant approached free propagators. we shall briey present in section 4 a 3d
reduction method based on sazdjians covariant approached free propagator [6, 12, 19].

9

 choose the total rest frame ~p =~0 as the reference frame. all quantities can then be made invariant

by building invariants with the 4-vector p.

 search for an implicit covariance by equivalence with an explicitly covariant equation. a 3d equation
obtained by reduction of an explicitly covariant bethe-salpeter equation will for example be implicitly
covariant if all terms of the series generated by the reduction are kept, even if the terms of the series are
not separately covariant. if the series is truncated, the 3d equation will be (implicitly) covariant up to
a given order only.

what about our equation (42)? we can write it in the three-fermion reference frame. if we switch
o the potentials v23 and v31, the equation for the subsystem (12) will still be written in the global
three-fermion rest frame, but this link with fermion 3 will disappear if we go back to the original two-
fermion bethe-salpeter equation, which is explicitly covariant. if the series generated by the reduction
of this equation is truncated, we loose the exact covariance of the two-fermion equation and the exact
cluster separability of the three-fermion equation.

a well known diculty in the writing of equations for two mutually interacting relativistic particles
in an external potential and for three or more mutually interacting relativistic particles is the continuum
dissolution problem: if we combine asymptotically free particles with opposite energy signs, it becomes
possible to build a continuum of solutions at any given total energy. this renders the building of nor-
malisable bound state solutions impossible. the introduction of our positive free-energy projectors is
the usual way of solving this problem. our 3d equation has solutions built entierely in the +++ = +1
subspace and satisfying

+++

 =

p0  e1  e2  e3

( v12 + v23 + v31).

(45)

we shall come back to this point in section 4.

where k123 is the sum of the purely three-body irreducible contributions. let us rst consider the case
of three two-body positive-energy, instantaneous and cluster-energy independent interactions k 0
ij (i.e.
containing ++
ij0, pij0, pij0 ). the bethe-salpeter equation becomes
in this case

replacing  in (48) by its expression (47) leads to a set of three coupled integral equations in the ij :

12(p30) =

1

2i z dp120 g0

1g0

2 12(cid:2) v 0

where p10, p20 must be written in terms of p0, p30, p120 :

12 12(p30) + v 0

23 23(p10) + v 0

31 31(p20)(cid:3)

p10 =

p0  p30

2

+ p120,

p20 =

 p120.

and similarly for 23 and 31. we shall now search for solutions ij(pk0) analytical in the lower
im(pk0) < 0 half plane and perform the integration (49) by closing the integration paths around these
regions. the only singularities will then be the poles of the free propagators. the result is

12(p30) =

++
12

(p0  s)  (p30  h3) + i (cid:2) v 0

1212(p30) + v 0

2323(e1) + v 0

(51)

3131(e2)(cid:3)

and similarly for 23 and 31 (from now on, we shall often write the equations for the (12) pair only,
understanding the two other equations obtained by circular permutations on the ijk indexes). solving

10

(51) with respect to 12(p30) gives a wave function which is analytical in the im(p30) < 0 half plane, and
conrms thus the existence of such solutions. furthermore, equation (51) shows that the three projections
+

k ij (ek) are equal (let us call them  ) and satisfy the 3d equation

moreover,  is the integral of the bethe-salpeter amplitude with respect to the relative times:

let us now choose

ij = k t ++

(52)

(53)

(54)

the 3d equation (52) is then built with the two-body potentials v 0
by (29) in section 2 for each fermion pair, and becomes equation (45).

ij = vij (p0hk), with the vij dened

let us now consider a non-approximated three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation (46) and try to trans-
form it into our 3d equation (52) above, completed by higher-order correction terms. it rst seemed us
a good idea to start with approximations giving the 3d equation (52) in a more direct way than above,
like

2 (p

g0

1g0

k12 (p

30  e3).

(55)

(56)

(57)

each of these approximations gives in each case the 3d equation (52), but the correction terms spoil
the result: with (55) or (56) they contain supplementary zero-order contributions. with (57) they
contain no supplementary zero-order contributions, but the correction terms can not easily be sorted by
increasing order. we must thus proceed more carefully. we nally decided to start with positive-energy,
instantaneous and cluster-energy independent approximations of the two-body kernels, like (54) or its
born approximation, adding the third +
k projector in order to avoid unnecessary complications, and to
proceed in three steps, inspired by the demonstration (46)-(52):

i) transform the bethe-salpeter equation (46) into a set of three coupled equations for the ij (pk0).
ii) transform this set into a set of three coupled 3d equations for the ij (ek) (these are not the

faddeev equations).

iii) transform this last set into a single 3d equation for , dened as the mean of the ij(ek).

3.3 three coupled equations for three cluster-energy depending amplitudes.

since eq. (64) ends with k 0, we can transform it into a set of three coupled equations for the ij (pk0),
now dened with the +++ projector:

the product of propagators (70) will be included in a clockwise path integral in p10. with positive-energy
instantaneous kernels, this integral is given by the residue of the pole of g0
1(p10) at p10 = e1. this is no
more true in the general case, but we can still isolate a part of g0

3.5 one 3d equation.

let us write (83) and the two other equations obtained by circular permutations in matricial form. we
shall dene

k = ij (ek),

ij =

the matrix  is the projector (2 =  ) on the uk = 1 vector (of norm 3). we have

  =  u ,

 =

( 1 + 2 + 3 ).

we can write eq. (83) in the form

 = m , m = m 0 + m r, m 0i1 =

p0  s + i

v 0
23, etc...

13

the action of the projector  on m 0 is

p0  s + i

v = v 0

12 + v 0

23 + v 0
31.

(88)

we shall now transform the matricial equation (87) into a scalar equation for . the expansion of (87)
with respect to  gives

in which m = m r. taking the scalar product with u leads nally to

  =  m ( 1 + m + m m +   )

in this equation, v 0 contains the projector +++ at left and at right, while m r contains it at right.
we can thus trivially transform (90) into an equation for +++.

3.6 first-order energy shift.

the 3d reduction above is rather complicated, since it implies three levels of series expansions. the
computation of the rst-order energy shift remains however tractable. the energy shift is, keeping only
the terms which contribute at rst-order:

p0  p (0)

0 = < (p0  s)

u ( 1 + m 0 ) m r u > .

we can make the replacements

1 + m 0 = 1 + m 0

would sum into a < v ri
12. the corrections
corresponding to the dierences between the various v rba
are a step towards gross spectator model
(see below, section 6 and [17, 18]).

12 > but we could also include this k ri

12 directly in k 0

12

the principal task remains however the calculation of the contributions of the singularities of the
k r
ij , for the integration paths dened by our choices of ab above. as we shall see in section 5.3, these
contributions could be as important as these coming directly from the relative time dependence of these
kernels (they could however be partially cancelled by the contributions of two-body non-ladder terms
and three-body terms [8, 12, 17] ). a general expression of the contributions of these singularities can be
obtained by splitting the propagators containing the poles considered in (99), using (72), the all-g part
giving (99).

ij (ek) of (97) is no more 1 in the terms containing gr

for more explicit results, we should specialize to specic three-fermion problems. it must be noted
that the ratio gij(pk0) g1
k (pk0). if the singularities of
k r in the complex pk0 plane lie far from the positive-energy mass shell, this ratio can be approximated
by (pk0ek)1 g1
ij (ek) and takes a relatively low value. this suggests us to neglect the contributions
of the terms containing gr
k (pk0) to (96), as these contributions contain at least one large denominator
more than the contributions of the terms containing g

k(pk0) . this leads to the replacement

vi (p0)  = 2i xk6=u

(100)

in (96). we isolated the contributions of the unconnected terms k = u (like k = 3 combined with k = 3
and k r

12 ). the resulting energy shift is now manifestly real.

3.7 cluster separability.

physically, if we switch o the (23), (31) and (123) interactions, we remain with a pair of interacting
fermions (12) and a free fermion (3). we would like to read this on our nal 3d equation. however:

 the cluster-separability condition may be satised by an exact 3d reduction, but not by its truncated

forms.

 even with an exact 3d reduction, the cluster separability property is a welcome bonus, not a
requirement: the bethe-salpeter equation (46), from which we started, is indeed correct for three-fermion
bound states only.

15

in our calculations above, the cluster-separability property is in general spoiled by our iteration of
(78), which starts with a term which vanishes at the (12) cluster-separated limit. the (12)-limit equation
is then built with the approached 2i12k 0
12 only. the cluster separability can however be restored
by performing a supplementary iteration, like our replacement of v 0 by p0  s in (93), leading to
the cluster-separable correction (99). another possibility consists in our previous choice (54) of the k 0
ij.
with this choice, the cluster-separated limits are exact. moreover, the corresponding two-body scattering
amplitudes are also correct (of course, we do not mean that we should keep all the terms of the k 0
ij
in an actual computation: we should only keep the ones which contribute up to the desired order).
simpler choices (as the born approximations) would however not be uncorrect in the calculation of the
three-fermion bound state spectrum.

4 other propagator-based 3d reductions.

4.1 two fermions.

we have already seen two dierent choices of g : salpeters propagator gs (19) and the positive-
energy propagator gp (20), which we used through this work until now. we could also use breits
propagator [39]:

gb(p0) = 2i (p0 s) g0 12.

(101)

in the two-fermion problem only, as it would lead to continuum dissolution in the two-fermion in an
external potential and in the three-fermion problems. the rst-order constraint (p0 s) could also be
replaced by the second-order constraint (p0), which leads to a simpler one-body limit, especially with
breits propagator (see section 7 below). in the spirit of grossspectator model, we could also choose the
unsymmetrical or symmetrized propagators

gg1(p0) = 2i +

2 (p20 e2) g0 12.

ggs(p0) = 2i

2 (p20 e2) + +

in the two-fermion problem (for the three-fermion problem, see below section 6).

(104)

the 3d potential is given by a series of separately covariant terms, so that we can truncate it without
breaking the covariance. in order to preserve this property in the two-fermion in an external potential
problem and in the three-fermion problem, without meeting continuum dissolution, we must however
combine this propagator with a covariant substitute of the noncovariant ++. a possible choice is the
product

++ = (p10)(p2

1)(p20)(p2

2) = (p10 | ~p1| ) (p20 | ~p2| )

(105)

in which the constraint will replace pi0 by 1
i > 0.
another diculty comes from the (p0 + s)/2|p0| operator which obliges us to perform supplementary
manipulations after the 3d reduction in order to render the potential hermitian, so that the born term
itself is nally given by a series. we examined elsewhere [40] how to use sazdjians propagator in the
two-fermion, two fermions in an external potential and three-fermion problems, leaving the reader decide
wether the covariance of the approximations balances the supplementary complications.

4.2 three fermions and continuum dissolution.

the results of a 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation can be used in the three-fermion
problem at two levels: by choosing the corresponding approximations of the two-fermion kernels in the
bethe-salpeter equation (46) , or by combining directly the corresponding potentials into a 3d equation
(42). both approaches turn out to be equivalent in the case of our 3d reduction based on gp . with the
other choices, the 3d equation obtained by reducing the approximated bethe-salpeter equation would
contain supplementary terms. in all cases, we get an exact three-fermion equation by switching o the
interactions with the third fermion. however, the three-fermion 3d equation built with the potentials
v b or v sz, based on approximated propagators without projectors, suers of continuum dissolution.
it is indeed possible to build a continuum of solutions with any a priori given total energy by combining
asymptotically free fermions with opposite energy signs. any physical bound state is thus mixed with such
a continuum and the building of normalisable bound state wave functions becomes impossible [13-16]. in
the pure two-body case the energy of a system (+, ) in the total rest frame is

e1  e2 = q~p2 + m2

1 q~p2 + m2

2 =

m2

1  m2
2

p~p2 + m2

1 +p~p2 + m2

2

(108)

and lies thus between m1  m2 (whichever the sign) and zero. we have thus no problem if we make the
assumption that the energies of the bound states lie between | m1  m2| and m1 + m2. below | m1  m2|
we meet the strong eld problem. the strong eld problem for the one-body plus potential and two-
body systems, the continuum dissolution problem for the two-body plus potential and three-body systems
are both consequences of the possibility of pair creation.

in the three-body case, the mixing with asymptotically separated (12)(3) subsystems of opposite
energy signs is excluded by the total momentum conservation, as in the two-fermion case. for the mixing
with three-fermion asymptotically free states, let us consider for example

e3  e1  e2 = q~p2

3 + m2

3 q~p2

1 + m2

2 + m2
2 ,

1 q~p2

~p1 + ~p2 + ~p3 = ~0.

(109)

there is no lowest value (we can for example have ~p3 = 0 and ~p1 = ~p2 arbitrarily large). the highest
values are obtained when ~p1 and ~p2 have the same direction, and for ~p1/m1 = ~p2/m2 =  ~p3/(m1+m2).
in this case we have

e3  e1  e2 = q~p2

3 + m2

3 q~p2

3 + (m1 + m2)2

(110)

so that e3  e1  e2 lies nally between  and (m3  m1  m2)(m3  m1  m2). symmetrically,
e1 + e2  e3 lies between (m1+m2m3)(m3m1m2) and . if we assume that the energies of the
bound states lie between (m1 +m2 +m3  2 inf(mi)) (i.e. above the highest negative-energy threshold)
and (m1 +m2 +m3), there is no degenerescence with the one plus-two minus states. on the contrary,
no weak eld assumption could prevent the degenerescence with the two plus-one minus states.

ij

, or their covariant substitutes ++

the continuum dissolution problem is avoided with the potentials containing the positive-energy
projectors ++
. the 3d equation built with salpeters potentials
ij , which include a ij at left and a  2
v s
ij at right, can be splitted into two uncoupled equations in the
123 = 1 subspaces and the solutions are eigenstates of 123 and free of continuum dissolution. the
123 = +1 subspace includes the three-plus and the two-minus one-plus components. the interaction
term is hermitian for a scalar product built with 123 = sign (1 + 2 + 3). equation (42) becomes then a
logical three-fermion extension of salpeters equation and exhibits a particle-antiparticle symmetry. we
do not expect however to get a large contribution from the two-minus one-plus components.

5 kernel-based 3d reductions.

5.1 two fermions.

our 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation was built around an approximation of the
free propagator. however, the rst step of our 3d reduction of the three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation
is built around instantaneous approximations of the kernels, while the second step is again built around
approximations of the free propagators. it is therefore interesting to examine also how a 3d reduction

17

of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation can be built around an instantaneous approximation of the
kernel. let us thus consider an approximation k z of the bethe-salpeter kernel:

the bethe-salpeter equation becomes

k = k z + k r.

 = g0k z + g0k r

 = (1  g0k r)1g0k z = gkk z

with

gk = g0 + g0k rg0 + g0k rg0k rg0 +     g0 + gkr .

(111)

(112)

(113)

(114)

if we now specialize k z to an instantaneous positive-energy kernel (k z independent of p0 and equal
to 12++12k z++ ), eq. (113) leads to the 3d equation

with

 = (g0 + gkr ) v z 

 = ++z dp0 (p0),
++ z dp

1
2i

gkr = 

v z = 2i 12k z,

0 dp0 gkr(p

0, p0) 12 ++.

(115)

(116)

(117)

(118)

the rst-order energy shift is, with the replacement gkrv z  gkr(p0 s) :

p0  p (0)

0 = 

1
2i

< (p 0 s)z dp

0 dp0 g0(p

0)k r(p

0, p0)g0(p0) 12 (p 0 s) > .

here again, all elements of (118) are total-energy dependent. although (118) is symmetric, the pertur-
bation potential (p0 s)gkrv z of (115) is not. this does not exclude the possibility of a real energy
spectrum:
if we admit an energy dependence of the potential (which we cannot avoid), we have also
the possibility of performing an innity of rearrangements of the equation. we can for example render
the potential symmetric by treating gkr as a perturbation of g0 (like gr as a perturbation of g in
section (2.2)). we can equivalently start with the corresponding 4d equation (113):

 = (g0 + gkr) k z =  + gkr k z

 = g0k z = g0k z(1  gkr k z)1  = g0k k

where

k k = k z + k zgkrk z +   

(119)

(120)

(121)

is a symmetric positive-energy instantaneous potential, since it begins and ends with k z . the 3d
equation is then

 = g0 v k ,

v k = 2i 12 k k,

(122)

 =z dp0  (p0)

and the rst-order energy shift is still given by (118). as for the propagator-based reduction, we can
represent the various contributions by feynman graphs. we can indeed get k k by considering the
transition operator

t = (k z + k r ) + (k z + k r ) g0 (k z + k r ) +   

(123)

and skipping some terms according to the two rules:

 each term must begin and end with k z
 there must be at least one k r between two consecutive k z.

the 3d transition operator is now 2i12t k with

t k = k k + k kg0k k +    = k k(1  g0k k)1

= k z(1  gkrk z)1(1  g0k z(1  gkrk z)1)1
= k z(1  gkrk z  g0k z)1 = k z(1  gkk z)1

18

= k z(1  (1  g0k r )1g0k z )1

= k z(1  g0k r  g0k z )1(1  g0k r ) = k z(1  g0k )1(1  g0k r )

replacing then k r by k k z and t (1g0k) by k gives

k z(1 + g0t ) (1  g0k r )

t k = k z + k zg0k z + k zg0 t g0k z.

(124)

(125)

in contrast with what happens in the propagator-based reductions, the on mass shell restriction of this
operator is not the physical scattering amplitude of eld theory. in fact, the bethe-salpeter equation (1),
without inhomogeneous term, is a bound state equation, and for the bound states we are only interested
in the poles of (125). these poles are the poles of t, unless the integrations on p
0, p0 make some
residues vanish. getting also the correct physical scattering amplitudes was a welcome bonus of the
propagator-based reductions.

if we want t in terms of t k, we can write (124) as

t k(1  g0k r )1 = k z(1 + g0t ) = (k  k r )(1 + g0t )

= t  k r (1 + g0t ) = (1  k r g0 )t  k r

t = (1  k r g0 )1 t k (1  g0k r )1 + (1  k r g0 )1 k r

= (1 + t rg0) t k (1 + g0t r) + t r

with

we have a large freedom in the choice of k z. we could choose

t r = k r + k rg0k r +    .

k z = 12 ++ 12 k(s, s) ++.

(126)

(127)

(128)

(129)

we could also keep only the ladder term of k, or a part of it in (129), like the coulomb part of the
one-photon exchange contribution. we could use k t (in this case we expect that the remainder of k k
does not nally contribute to the total energy spectrum) or an approximation of it (one and two photon
exchange terms, for example). phillips and wallace [20] suggested to choose k z in order to annihilate
gkr exactly or up to a given order. if we choose to annihilate it at rst-order, the rst-order energy
shift (118) vanishes and we get

k z =

1

(2)2 12 (g0)1++z dp

0 dp0 g0(p

0)k(p

0, p0)g0(p0) 12 (g0)1++.

(130)

the skipping of terms in (123) is then improved, as we must now have at last two k r between two
consecutive k z. if we choose to annihilate gkr exactly, we get, using (127), (117) and the relation
gkr = g0t rg0 :

1

(2)2 12 (g0)1++z dp

0 dp0 g0(p

0)t (p

0, p0)g0(p0) 12 (g0)1++ = t k

(131)

which is the ++ projection of the expression given in [20] (they use salpeters propagator and write
thus ++   instead of ++ ). in this case, t k gives the correct physical scattering amplitudes
when p 0  e1 + e2, as the operators (g0)1 kill the contributions of the singularities other than the
poles of g0.

5.2 three fermions.

we could also use the results of the kernel-based 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation
as the starting point of a 3d reduction of the three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation, by choosing

k 0

ij = k k

ij (s, s, p0 hk)

(132)

as starting approximations in (54), in order to recover, at the 2+1 separated clusters limits, the kernel-
based 3d equations.

5.3 one-photon exchange.

let us now compute (130) with k given by the one-photon exchange graph, in feynman gauge:

we have

with

k =

2ie2

(p p)2 + i

(p10  e1 + i1) (p0  p10  e2 + i2)

(133)

(134)

(135)

and k = p p. closing the integration paths clockwise, and taking the 1  0 limit before the   0
limit in all terms, we get

i = 42

( 1 +

rk ),

(136)

(e

2  |~k|

p0  e1  e

1  e
2)

.

(137)

the rst term comes from the residues of the poles of the propagators only, while the terms of rk
combine the residues of one pole of the propagators and one pole of the kernel. modifying the integration
paths or the order of the limits would give the same result (after rearrangements). at lowest order, we
get

rk  2p0  e

1  e

2  e1  e2.

(138)

the contribution of rk to the bound state energy will nally be in 3, while the replacement of
1  e1)2  ~k2 by simply ~k2 (coulomb potential) would lead to a correction in 4. this means
(e
that the relative energy dependence of the kernel, at the ladder approximation, contributes mostly by
providing supplementary poles inside the integration paths. beyond the ladder approximation however,
the contribution of the rst crossed graph will cancel the leading term in 3, leaving a contribution in
4 [42]. this is not a surprise, as it is well known that, in well chosen propagator-based reductions, all
higher-order contributions cancel mutually at the one-body limit [8, 12].

by rearranging (136, 137), we can also write

i =

p0  e1  e

(139)

which is the expression obtained in time-ordered perturbation theory [41]. here, each term describes the
emission of a photon by one fermion, followed by its absorption by the other one.

5.4 time-ordered perturbation theory

in time-ordered perturbation theory (topt), one takes the fourier transform of the full propagator (as
given by the feynman graphs method) with respect to the energy variables. each graph becomes then
splitted into several time-ordered graphs, and one integrates the result with respect to the time intervals.
this leads to topt feynman rules. the topt graphs can be arranged in order to get an iterative
equation for the propagator, and, by isolating the residues of the three-body bound state poles, to get
an homogeneous 3d equation for the three-body bound state wave functions (this imitates the usual
derivation of the inhomogeneous and homogeneous bethe-salpeter equations). the cluster-separability
property is translated by the factorization of the propagator at the dierent vanishing interactions limits.
the two and three-body 3d potentials are directly given, at any order, by the topt feynman rules.
up to now, this approach has been applied to a very simple model: the exchange of a scalar meson
between two or three positive-energy bosons or fermions at the ladder approximation [41]. our results in
this work can be applied to more general interactions but should lead to more complicated calculations

20

than topt at higher-orders. a comparison of our rst-order contributions computed with the simple
bethe-salpeter kernel used in [41] should be interesting.

it must be noted that our motivation for introducing the positive-energy projectors is not that of
[41]: we make the choice of approaching the exact equation for the positive-energy components, while
[41] simply neglects these components as a temporary simplication. it will be interesting to see in which
form the continuum dissolution problem appears in topt when the negative-energy components are
taken into account.

6 relation with faddeev formalism and gross spectator model.

the nonrelativistic faddeev equations can be obtained by transforming schrodingers equation (in a rst
step, without three-body terms) into a set of three coupled equations for three parts tij of the transition
operator ( tij denotes the contribution of all graphs beginning by a (ij) interaction). the input is the set of
the three two-body transition operators and the resulting series expansion contains only connected graphs
(never twice the same two-body transition operator). this formalism is well adapted to the description
of the various scattering processes, such as (12) + 3  (12) + 3 (elastic scattering), (12) + 3  (12) + 3
(excitation), (12) + 3  1 + (23) (rearrangement), (12) + 3  1 + 2 + 3 (breakup). the (123) bound
states correspond to the poles of this transition operator.

the structure of these equations can be generalized to relativistic equations which are not necessarily

(exactly) reducible to a single 3d equation.

in gross spectator model [17, 18], faddeevs type equations are deduced from the bethe-salpeter
equation and the transition operator is written in terms of the two-body transition operators. the relative
time variables are then eliminated by putting, in each three-body propagator, all the omassshallness on
the only fermion which interacts before and after. the lorentz invariance-cluster separability requirement
is satised by applying suitable lorentz boosts on the two-body transition operators.

the main dierence between our approach and gross approach comes from the fact that we are
(presently) interested by the (123) bound states only, to be computed principally by using a single 3d
equation (such as the one from which faddeev starts). instead of working with the two-body transition
operators, we work with the two-body potentials. we can however present our approach in terms of the
two-body transition operators. our approximation of each two-body transition operator is then unique
and does not depend on the operators which come in front and behind it in the expansion of the faddeev
equations. this enables us to describe our model by a single 3d potential equation, by a set of three
faddeev equations, or by the expansion of the three-body transition operator in terms of the two-body
ones. another feature of our model is to not introduce lorentz boosts by hand: the lorentz-invariance /
cluster separability requirement is exactly satised if we do not truncate our potentials (practically, this
means that the satisfaction of this requirement and the approximation of the potentials can be improved
together). let us go back to the three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation and neglect for simplicity the
three-body irreducible kernel k123. dening

12 = g0

(147)

this approximation, combined with equation (145), implies that 12(p120, p30) is independent of p120
(let us write thus 12(p30) ). equation (145) becomes then

12(p30) = 12 t 0

where p10, p20 must be written in terms of p0, p30, p120. equation (148), together with similar equations
for 23(p10) and 31(p20), admits solutions which are analytical in the im(pk0) < 0 half planes. at

result by approaching directly t12 by t 0
12(p30). this means approaching k12 by a

the key point of the manipulations above is the dominance of the positive-energy poles of g0

2
in (145). this was obtained by approaching k t
12 positive-energy
projectors. we could try to insure the dominance of these two poles more economically. let us come
back to equation (145) without making any approximation on t12. the elements of (145) are then the

and (145) must be integrated with respect to p120, with p30 xed. we must thus write p230, p10, p310, p20
in terms of p120, p30. searching as above for solutions ij ( p
ij0, pk0 ) which are analytical in the im(pk0) <
0 half planes, we shall close our integration path clockwise (counterclockwise) in front of 23 ( 31 ) and
keep only the residue of the pole of ++
12 g0

the elements of (145) are then replaced by

the manipulations above are submitted to some restrictions on the tij. in the pk0 variable the tij
must be analytical in the im(pk0) < 0 half planes.
ij0 and pij0 variables the tij must be
analytical in the whole complex plane. moreover, the tij must also be asymptotically bounded in the
three variables and contain ++
positive-energy projectors. these conditions are of course not satised
by the exact transition matrix elements, but we shall assume that the singularities and the negative-
energy parts of the tij can be neglected in the computation of the integrals with respect to the relative
energies.

where the upper indexes refer to the initial and nal on mass shell non-spectator fermions. equations
(156),(157), together with similar equations for the (23) and (31) pairs, are a closed system of six 3d
equations. in each tij two fermions are on the mass shell: the spectator fermion k and the fermion
which is not going to interact next left ( p
ij0 ) or next right ( pij0 ). this is of course the philosophy of
gross spectator model [17, 18].

ij and kij constant with k t

if we replace s by s in the tij we get our basic three-cluster model. this supplementary approxi-
mation can be justied by noticing that we already neglected the contributions of the singularities of tij
in the p
ij0 and pij0 complex planes. the dependence on these variables can thus not be very strong, as
we know that a function which is analytical and bounded on the whole complex sphere must necessarily
be a constant. using the same argument of the consistency of the approximations, we could also argue
that tij constant implies k t
ij = kij. our basic three-cluster equation is
thus not a priori a worse approximation of the three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation than gross equa-
tions, nor a better approximation than the simpler positive-energy instantaneous approximation or the
corresponding born approximation. it reects the choice of preserving the exact cluster-separated limits.
to conclude the comparison between our 3d reduction and gross spectator model, we can say that,
at lowest order, our 3d reduction is much simpler: our two-body transition operators are always taken
at the same value of the corresponding relative energie, so that we can transform the set of coupled
equations for the transition operators into a unique equation for a wave function. we do not use lorentz
boosts, as we choose to exploit the implicit lorentz covariance of the unapproximated separated-clusters
limit equations, so that the eects of these boosts will be approached in principle by the progressive
introduction of the higher-order two-fermion terms. gross higher-order corrections introduced by taking
the transition operators with dierent fermions on the mass shell are not a priori more important than
the contributions of the singularities of these transition operators themselves to the closed path integrals
in the relative energies. our brief calculation with the one-photon exchange graph (subsection 5.3) shows
that, in this case, the contributions of these singularities are in fact more important, by an order of
 (but it turns out that the leading order of these contributions will be cancelled by the leading order
contribution of the rst crossed graph [42]). our higher-order calculation takes both types of contributions
into account.

7 heavy mass limits and external potentials.

7.1 heavy mass limits in the two-fermion problem.

when the mass of one of the fermions goes to innity, we must nd the equation of the other fermion in
a potential (a dirac equation with a coulomb potential in qed). this limit can be obtained directly, or
via a rearrangement of the equation. with breits equation with the second-order constraint and with
sazdjians equation, the higher-order ladder and crossed terms cancel mutually at the one-body limit, so
that the correct limit of the potential is already contained in the born term. with salpeters equation with
the second-order constraint, and with the positive-energy equation with a second-order constraint, the
limit is also a dirac-coulomb equation, but solved with respect to the + part of the wave function:
the  part is transformed into higher-order contributions to the potential. the physical content
remains identical to that of a dirac-coulomb equation, but the correct limit of the potential is no more
entierely contained in the born term, so that a truncation of the potential would spoil the one-body limit
[8-12]. with the rst-order constraint, the results are similar, but after complicated rearrangements of
the equation.

in the three-fermion problem, we expect similarly that, at the limit of an innite fermion mass, we
would get an equation describing two fermions in an external potential. it is thus interesting to compare
this equation with the equation we wrote directly [16] for the two-fermion in an external potential system.

7.2 two fermions in an external potential.

the two-fermion plus potential problem can be approached in two ways which we shall call the two-
body and the three-body approaches. in the two-body approach, the external potential is included in the
denition of the creation and annihilation operators of eld theory. practically, we can keep the equations

23

obtained in the treatment of the pure two-fermion problem, using simply a generalized denition of the
hi [14, 15, 16]:

hi = ~i .~pi + i mi + vi(~xi)

(158)

where vi
is the external potential acting on the fermion i. all quantities can be expanded on the basis
built with the eigenstates of h1 and h2. in the three-body approach, the free creation and annihilation
operators are used and the external potential is treated as an heavy third body. this approach will be
presented as an heavy mass limit of the three fermion problem in the next subsection.

the equations for two fermions in an external potential must be written in the laboratory reference
frame (in which the external potential is dened) and are not lorentz invariant. if we switch o the
mutual interaction we get a pair of uncoupled equations for two independent fermions in an external
potential. if we switch o the external potential the equations remain written in the laboratory frame,
which still refers to the vanished external potential. if the reduction series is not truncated, this no-
external interaction limit of the equation is equivalent to a pure two-fermion covariant bethe-salpeter
equation.

7.3 heavy mass limits in the three-fermion problem.

let us now take our 3d equation (42), with the potentials vij obtained by performing 3d reductions
based on the gp
as in section 2, but with the second-order constraints (pij0  ij ) instead of the
ij
rst-order constraints (pij0  sij). when m3, for example, goes to innity (two-body limit), we get,
writing p0 = w12 + m3 :

 =

w12  h1  h2

1

(v12 + v +

2 + v +

1 ) 

(159)

(160)

with (p0  h3) replaced by w12 in v12. the potential v +
2

is given by the series

v +
2 = +

2 (cid:20)v2 + v2


2

(w12 h1) + e2  i

v2 + ...(cid:21) +

2

where v2 is an external potential acting on fermion 2 (it is a coulomb potential in qed, if we use the
second-order constraint, but in general it could still depend on (w12  h1) ). the potential v +
is given
1
by a similar formula.
the dierences with the two-body approach of the two-body plus potential problem are:

 the projectors 
 the external potential for fermion 2 is now v +

i are the free ones.

2 , given by the series (160). this is the potential
obtained by solving the equation for fermion 2 in the external potential v2 with respect to the positive
free energy components, the unobservable energy of fermion 2 being replaced in it by w12 h1.

 v2 itself could still depend on (w12 h1) and vice-versa.

the cluster separability property in the three-body way survives the high-mass limit: switching o v2
and v1 leads to the equation for the (12) two-fermion system, switching o v12 and v1 leads to a free
dirac equation for fermion 1 with the +
2 projection of the dirac equation for fermion 2 in the external
potential v2. in the two-body approach of the two-fermion plus potential problem we had however more:
switching o the mutual interaction only led to a pair of independent equations for each fermion in the
external potential. here, in the three-body approach, the equation does not split perfectly into two
parts: we can write w12 = w1 + w2, but we have w12  h1 instead of w2 in the series dening v +
2
and vice-versa. this is a consequence of the energy dependence introduced into (160) by the use of
the anti-continuum dissolution projectors, combined with our choice of putting the spectator fermion on
the mass shell in each two-body interaction, and neglecting the three-body terms which could balance
this modication. the discrepancy is of order v 4. at the two-fermion plus potential level, a better but
still not perfect equation would be obtained by replacing h1 by h1 + v1 in the series dening v +
2 and
vice-versa.

8 conclusions

we have written a 3d equation for three fermions (our basic three-cluster equation) by combining the three
two-body potentials obtained by an untruncated propagator-based 3d reduction of the corresponding

24

two-fermion bethe-salpeter equations, putting the spectator fermion on the mass shell.
in this way,
the cluster-separated limits are exact, and the lorentz invariance / cluster separability requirement is
automatically satised, provided no supplementary approximation, like the born approximation, is made.
such a truncation would render the lorentz covariance of the two-fermion clusters only approximate (a
born approximation preserving the lorentz invariance / cluster separability property can be obtained by
using another 3d reduction based on a covariant second-order two-body propagator of sazdjian, combined
with a covariant substitute of ++. this leads to a 3d three-cluster equation which is covariantly born
approximable, but more complicated [40] ). our 3d equation can be written in terms of the two-body
potentials, or in terms of two-body transition operators (faddeev formalism). the use of positive free-
energy projectors in the chosen reductions of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equations prevents our
3d three-fermion equation from continuum dissolution. the potentials are hermitian and depend only
slowly on the total three-fermion energy. the one high-mass limits of our basic three-cluster equation
are approximately exact. the correction of the remaining discrepancy would demand the introduction of
higher-order three-body terms.

our combination of cluster separability and lorentz invariance in the three fermion problem makes
explicit use of the fact that the clusters can only be two-fermion and/or free fermion states. this is not
directly adaptable to four or more fermion systems. in this respect, 3 is still not n.

our 3d equation can be written directly, or derived from an approximation of the three-fermion
bethe-salpeter equation, in which the three-body kernel is neglected while the two-body kernels are
approached by positive-energy instantaneous expressions, with the spectator fermion on the mass shell.
the correction terms are thus known at the bethe-salpeter level and can be transformed into corrections
to the 3d equation.

our lowest-order three-fermion 3d equation is much simpler than the equations written in the frame-
work of gross spectator model, which contain some induced higher-order three-fermion contributions.
our calculation of the next order shows that these contributions are not a priori more important that the
ones coming from the singularities of the kernels, neglected in gross model. we think that the relative
importance of the dierent contributions could largely depend on the specic problem studied.

there exists an innity of ways of performing the 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter
equation. the potentials generated by these reductions could all by used to build a three-fermion 3d
equation, keeping however in mind the continuum dissolution problem. this leaves us a large freedom to
suit phenomenological needs.

we have also examined the possibility of using kernel-based 3d reductions in the two and three-
fermion problems. we found that this kind of 3d reduction can also be used in the calculation of bound
states, despite the fact that they do not lead to the correct scattering operators (excepting in phillips
and wallaces reduction).

as a rst test of our methods in a specic problem, we are presently working on a system of two or
three fermions exchanging photons in feynman or coulombs gauges [42]. the various terms generated by
our propagator-based 3d reduction will be compared with these generated by a kernel-based 3d reduction
and with these written in the framework of gross spectator model.
