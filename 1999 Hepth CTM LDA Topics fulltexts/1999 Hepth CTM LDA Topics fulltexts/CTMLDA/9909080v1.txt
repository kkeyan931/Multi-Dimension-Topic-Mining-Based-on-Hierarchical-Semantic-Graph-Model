abstract

we study the signicance of t-duality in the context of the grav-
itational description of gauge theories. we found that t-duality re-
lates the deferents points of the moduli of a given gauge theory always
far from the conformal xed point. also the described gauge theo-
ries seems to ow naturally to the able conformal points, those that
naturally saturate all the possible known examples of near horizon ge-
ometries. supersymmetry properties and t-duality breaking of it are
discuss.

introduction

a natural question to ask in the general framework of string descriptions
of gauge theories, is the quantum eld theoretical meaning of pure string
symmetries(for a review closely related see [1]). in the celebrated ads/cft
correspondence the sl(2, z) s-duality of the type iib-string can be in-
terpreted as the string version of the well known monton olive sl(2, z)
duality of n = 4 sym [2]. the quantum eld theory meaning of t-duality
is however a bit less clear since t-duality interpolates dierent d-branes
and therefore tends to dene maps between yang mills theories in dierent
dimensions. moreover t-duality transformation generally produce explicit
breaking of supersymmetry.

the simplest possible way to address this questions on t-duality in a
purely quantum eld theoretical framework is of course by dening the
quantum eld theory using the near horizon (nh) limit of d-branes metrics
and working out in this limit t-duality transformations. nevertheless the
gravitational description of the gauge theories related to the non-conformal
d3-brane are not so well understood. the works on ads/cft studying
holography are not applicable (at least directly) to these cases as the ge-
ometries involved are not ads.

to proceed with this studies, we concentrate on the t-duality between
the dierent d-branes, and consider the commutativity between the nh
limit and the t-duality transformation. once this is done, the nh geome-
tries for dp-branes, with p 6= 3 are rewritten in terms of ads variables.
then what we have found is a metric with an ads term plus other factors,
that in the allowed limits of the original papers [3], correspond to small
compact dimension. hence, recovering in this way an induce conformal
structure. as a direct application, by looking into the induced action of
so(2, 4) on the t-dual geometries of ads5, we have obtained a new kind
of symmetry group, baptised as the generalised conformal group (gcg), a
sort of generalisation of the conformal transformations found by jevicki and
yoneya in a completely independent manner in a recent paper [5].

in the following we study the t-duality transformation for the nh limit
of the d-branes, and nd under what specic limits the duality is realised.
in particular as an example, the d0-brane case is considered. then a few
conclusions and remarks are stated giving an interpretation for the holog-
raphy conjecture in these cases. then the study on the moduli space of
the corresponding sym is given, resulting in new approaches to the conjec-
ture, interrelating nh d-branes and nh m-branes. also the appropriated
discussion on supersymmetry enhancement is include.

2 t-duality and near horizon geometries

to study the holographic nature of the maldacena conjecture, we must make
contact with the d3-brane case, as it is the only case where we believe that
we know the mathematical structure underlying the conjecture. we also
know that the d-branes are related by t-duality, and that this duality is
also realised on the low energy solitonic solutions of supergravity and in
the corresponding born-infeld type action describing the internal degrees of
freedom of the d-brane. therefore an obvious line of approach to understand
the mathematical structure of the above conjecture for p 6= 3 is to prepare
the dp-branes for t-duality i.e. to set them up wrapped on a torus t s.
then, take the nh limit and check the t-duality of this geometry. the result
of this type of analysis should be a precise dictionary from ads variables in
the d3-brane case and the variables in the other nh geometries, allowing a
careful inspection on both structures.

consider the case of n d0-branes on a torus t 3. the supergravity

solution is given by the equation,

ds2

0 = h(r, r)1/2(dt2) + h(r, r)1/2" 9
xi=7

e = g0h(r, r)3/2

d(ir)2 + dr2 + r2d5#

(1)

where the harmonic function is given by,

h(r, r) = 1 + g0l7
s

n

xn=1xni  

[(x7  xn7 + n7r)2 + ...+ | r  rn |2]7/2! (2)

qn

where g0 is the string coupling constant, ls is the string length, qn is the
charge of the d0-brane, ri are the radius of the torus and r is the radius on
spherical coordinates for the m 6 space time.

at distances much longer that ri, we can poisson resum the expression

for the harmonic function h, obtaining,

h(r, ri) = 1 +

g0l7
s k3
r4iri

(3)

where k3 stand for the irrelevant constant factors not display on the forth-
coming discussions. on this solution we take the nh limit, by dening a
triple blow up,

  0 , u =

r


ui =

ri


,

g2
y m = g03/2

3

(4)

where gy m is dened as usual up to a 2 factor, irrelevant for our forth-
coming discussions.

note that the new variables vi, gy m correspond properly speaking to a
blow up of the point ri = 0 and g0 =  on the moduli space of the above
metric. the metric and dilaton for the resulting nh geometry is,

r(n, ui)2

u 2 x d(iui)2 +

ds2

0 = "

u 2

r(n, ui)2 (dt2) +

e =   g03/2

+r(n, ui)2d5i
q ui ! r(n, ui)3q ui

u 3

r(n, ui)2

u 2

du 2+

(5)

.

where now we have dened r(n, ui) = (cid:20)(cid:18) g03/2k3n
q3 ui

let us consider the t-dual theory of the above geometry, by using the
busher rules for the metric and dilaton in the presence of ramond elds.
in future sections we will examine this procedure more closely, but for the
actual proposes it is good enough to follow the usual rules [4]. once this is
done we get the metric,

(cid:19)(cid:21)1/4

ds2

3 = " u 2

r(n )2 (dt2 +x d(i

e = g3

1
ui

)2) +

r(n )2

u 2 du 2 + r(n )2d5#

(6)

where r(n ) = (g3n k3)1/4. this metric corresponds to a d3-brane nh
geometry on a torus t 3. therefore, we have recovered the nh geometry of
the d3-brane. again, note that the d3-brane is wrapped around the t 3. in
the limit of small ui we recover the at d3-brane. this limit is related to
a small expectation value for the higgs elds on the d0-brane side, rather
than a small compact circle!.

the above type of computation can be reproduced for any d-brane.
therefore we can obtain the nh t-dual geometry corresponding to any t-
dual d-brane. hence we can interrelate the elds and variables of the other
nh geometries with the well understood d3-brane geometry, characterising
the global structure of the t-dual spaces. this can be summarised on the
following diagram,

the vertical lines mean t-duality and horizontal lines mean nh limits.

to proceed with the research program, we recall that the nh geometries
under study have to satisfy some inequalities to show holography. basically,
we need to rely on perturbative quantum gravity calculations, hence we
demand small values for the ricci scalar , and small values of the dynamical
string coupling e. for the d0-brane case these restrictions translate into
the following inequalities,

(8)

q ui !#3/4

if we
the solution of these inequalities must be treated with some care.
are considering the nh geometries in a regime where there is a t-dual map
to other nh geometry, we have to add another inequality, stating that the
would be string coupling constant on the t-dual geometry is also small.
in our case, this is precisely the string coupling constant of the d3-brane i.e.
g3  1. once this is taken into account, the above inequalities imply that,

n >> 1 , u  rui

(9)

therefore, to have holography in this framework, we should demand that:

 n is large (trusting sugra)

 gy m small (pertubative string theory)

 ui small (big range on the u variable on the holography)

if the above conditions on the nh geometry are realised, we can see what
is really going on. the metric for the d0-branes approaches a ads2 times
the ve-sphere times some perturbations. we know that we have holography
on this conguration (as this metric is t-dual to a d3-brane metric), there-
fore we are ready to say that we have holography on the bulk space, when the
space time geometry for a general dp-brane takes the form ads5s  s5  t s
and the torus is really a perturbation of the other terms of the metric. the
resulting structure is very natural from a holographic point of view, we un-
derstand this holography as the bulk space is on these cases ads space
time.

note that for the d0-brane case we have an s1 frontier and ads2 bulk
space, in the maximal holographic case (when the radius of the torus is
innitesimal), but as long as ui gets bigger, the holography is understand
only from a given value of u called it u0, to innity. what happens on the
area dened for u < u0 is not well understand and therefore we left it out
of the analysis.

the above diagrams show the area of validity for the maldacenas con-
jecture when a t-duality map is considered to a d3-brane nh geometry.

3 t-duality and gauge theories

to begin with, let us start considering a d3-brane living in a ten dimensional
space time with one of the orthogonal coordinates compactied on a circle

7

s1 of radius r. the corresponding metric is given by

ds2
3 = h(r, r)1/2(dx2
e = g,

||) + h(r, r)1/2(d(r)2 + dr2 + r2d4)

(10)

with x|| standing for world volume coordinates and the harmonic function
h given by

h(r, r) = 1 + gl4
s

n

xn=1xni  

[(y9  yn9 + n9r)2+ | r  rn |2]4/2! ,

qn

(11)

where g is the string coupling constant, ls is the string length, qn is the
charge of the d3-brane, r is the radius of the circle s1 and r is the radius
on spherical coordinates for the 5 space time. from now on we will ignore
any constant and will work with meaningful variables in the discussion, and
always at large n.

at distances much longer than r, we can poisson resum the expression

(11) obtaining

h(r, r) = 1 +

l4
sg
rr3 .

(12)

this is a good solution as far as r is small enough.

if we are interested in the nh limit [3] of this metric we would be forced

to dened this limit by performing a double blow up, namely

(cid:18)  0 , u 

r
 = constant

,

v 

r

 = constant(cid:19) .

(13)

notice that the new variable v correspond properly speaking to a blow up
of the point r = 0 in the moduli of the target space time metric (10) with
the harmonic function of (12). after performing the blow up (13) we get
the metric

ds2

v1/2

d4 +

g1/2v3/2

u 3/2 d2#

e = g.

(14)

note that the dilaton eld for this solution is constant. the topology of the
space time (14) is that o a bration of a circle s1 and a sphere s4 on the
space dened on the coordinates (x, u ) with the corresponding radius

rs 1 = (

rs 4 = (

gv3
u 3 )1/4,
gu
)1/4,
v

8

(15)

which depends on the moduli v.
it is easy to see that this space time
admits only 16 real supercharges. the simplest way to understand this is
by observing that 1
2 of the killing spinors for the near horizon geometry of
the d3-brane are projected out once we compactify a transverse direction
(we will come back to this point later on).

from the qft point of view we should expect the metric (14) to be
related to a sym theory in 3 + 1 dimensions, with 16 real supercharges and
with a peculiar r-symmetry given by the isometries of s4  s1. the type
of strings living on the space time (14) is type iib.

consider next the candidate for a t-dual geometry, namely the d4-brane
compactied on a s1 of radius r, on its world volume. this solutions is given
by

ds2
4 = h (1/2)(dx2
e = gh 1/4,

|| + d(r)2) + h (1/2)(dr2 + r2d4)

(16)

with x|| expanding the non-compact four dimensional part of the world vol-
ume of the d4-brane, and the corresponding harmonic function

h = 1 +

gl3
s
r3 .

taking the nh limit, dened by again a double blow up

(cid:18)  0 , u 

r
 = constant

,

g2

5  g1/2 = constant(cid:19) ,

we get the metric

ds2

4 = " u 3/2
5 u 3/4.

e = g3/2

g5

(dx2

|| + (dr)2) +

g5

u 3/2 du 2 + g5u 1/2d4#

(17)

(18)

(19)

note that this time the dilaton is not constant. the number of super-
symmetries in this brane is again 16 real supercharges, however the qft
interpretation is a bit dierent. in this case we have a d = 5 sym theory
living on 4 s1. the corresponding radius of the four-sphere and the circle
are

rs 4 = (g2

rs 1 = (

figure 1: moduli space for near horizon d4-brane.

before proceeding any further, let us clarify the picture we have (see g. 1).
in the d3-brane case we obtained the near horizon geometry as the result
of a limit where one of the moduli g was left constant, but we allowed r
to varied such that, at r = 0, we created a divisor v. these two variables
dened our moduli (v, g). the resulting geometry is that of a base space
expanded by the coordinates (x, u ) and bers s4 and s1 with the radius of
equation (15). in the d4-brane, we obtained the near horizon geometry as
the result a another limit where one of the moduli r is maintained constant
while the other g varies such that at the innite point we create a new divisor
g5. these two variables dene the new moduli (r, g5). again the geometry
obtained is that of a base manifold expanded by the coordinates (x, u ) and
bers s4 and s1 with the radius of equation (20). in order to identify both
metrics (13,19) by t-duality we must require the following relation between
the dierent moduli,

g =

v =

,

g2
5
r
1
r

.

(21)

provided that this relation holds, we can perform the t-duality transforma-

10

tion following the buscher rules [4]. in principle we could run into diculties
if too many singular point appear on the bration, so that t-duality could
loose its natural meaning. this t-dual map is well dened all over the base
manifold. actually we only have singularities at u = 0 and u = , but both
points are related to wrong coordinate patches rather than real singularities.
therefore this t-dual map is a very trivial example of ber-wise t-duality
[6]. the map described above is dened by t-duality, and eectively acts
between the two moduli.

by now we have a neat relation between the bare coupling constants of
both gauge theories in the two near horizon metrics. on the other hand, the
dilaton behavior is usually associated with the value of the corresponding
running coupling constant i.e. the eective gauge coupling constant. there-
fore, to obtain the eective coupling of the compactied gauge theory on the
world volume of the d4-brane, we consider the ratio of the eective coupling
constant of the ve dimensional gauge theory g5 squared, with the eective
radius of compactication namely the radius of the s1 given on equation
(20), hence we get

g2
4ef f 

g2
5ef f
ref f

.

then after solving for the moduli variables (v, g) we obtain

g2
4ef f = g.

(22)

(23)

therefore, the eective coupling constant of the gauge theory we are study-
ing from the point of view of the near horizon d4-brane has the same running
behaviour as the the gauge theory on the near horizon d3-brane, as should
be expected invoking duality. note that equation (22) was obtained by plau-
sible physical relations, however this equation is nothing more than the rule
for changing the dilaton under t-duality!

on the other hand, the super yang mills theory on the d4 brane is not
renormalizable, we can trust it only at low energies. this aspect of the
gauge theory can be seen from the gravitational point of view. note that,
for the geometry (19), the dilaton grows for large u . actually, we can trust
this solution as long as u  1/g2
5, after this point we should think in terms
of m-theory.

the other possibility we have is to consider the d3-brane wrapped on a

circle s1 of radius r. this time the nh geometry is dened by the limit

(cid:18)  0 , u 

r

 = constant(cid:19) ,

(24)

11

where (g, r) are kept constant on the process. note that this time we dont
have the double blow up of the above cases. the resulting metric is given
by

ds2

3 = " u 2

g1/2 (d(r)2 + dx2

||) +

g1/2

u 2 du 2 + g1/2d5)#

e = g.

(25)

again the dilaton is constant, and the topology is that of a bration of a
circle s1 and the sphere s5, on the space dened by the coordinates (x, u ),
with the corresponding radius

rs 1 =

u r
g1/4 ,
rs 5 = g1/4.

(26)

this conguration also only admits 16 real supercharges. the situation on
the eld theory should be that of a d = 4 sym theory living on 3  s1
with 16 real supercharges and r-symmetry contained on so(6).

the t-dual nh background is the result of rst, a poisson resume of
the d2-brane solution with a transverse direction compactied on a small
circle s1 of radius r, second its nh limit dened by the triple blow up, here
showed

the resulting metric and dilaton are given by

(28)

this time we have space time with 16 real supercharges, the metric denes
a bration on a circle s1 and the sphere s5 on the base space expanded by
the coordinates (x, u ) and the eld theory point of view should be that
of a sym theory on 2 + 1 dimensions, with 16 real supercharges, and r-
symmetry contained in s0(6)  u (1). the corresponding radius of the bers

(29)

to perform the t-duality map between this two metrics, we require to iden-
tify the moduli as follows,

g =

,

g2
3
v
1
v

r =

.

(30)

similar remarks about the validity of t-duality of the d3-brane and the
d4-brane are applicable to this case.

in general, we can consider the above type of compactication of the d3-
brane on a t 3s, which takes us to the near horizon d(s)-brane on a t 3s
in the perpendicular coordinates. the metric of these geometries looks like
adss+2  s5  t 3s. when the holography map between the gauge theories
and the bulk geometries is dened 1 the radius of the torus is very small.
also we nd that when r  , we recover on these d(s)-branes the full
range of running for u (0, ), while for small r we are forced to stay at big
values of the holographic variable u .

it is well known that t-duality breaks supersymmetry in some cases [7]
and our previous metrics are not exceptions to this phenomenon. note that
we are relating theories with 16 real supercharges, but we already showed
that the near horizon d3-brane shows enhancement of supersymmetry. the
matching condition for the number of supersymmetries is given by the fact
that the compact direction on the d3-brane (on both cases) eliminates the
possibility of that enhancement, while the other dp-branes dont show the
enhancement at all. let us study a bit more carefully this point.

in general the relevant system of killing spinor equations for the dp-

brane ansatz is given by

where we have solved for the dp-brane ansatz using the split m = (, r, )
where (r, ) are perpendicular coordinates to the brane, also  is a 32-

on propose leave the dilaton unspecied in terms of h. it is important to
recall that the dilatino equation is crucial as projects out one half of the su-
persymmetries. to dene the nh limit of the above system, it is convenient
to give a more geometrical meaning to the dilatino, as a part of the com-
ponent of the relevant gravitino in an embedding supergravity like d=11
supergravity for the type iia d-branes solutions or in a f-theory framework
for type iib d-branes. once this is done (for example in the 11d case) the
nh limit of the above system gives,

in this case the dilatino equation goes to zero in the near horizon limit,
giving no constraints. nevertheless the consistency conditions correspond-
ing to the gravitino equation, contains the dilatino equation among others.
after the usual decomposition of the killing spinors, dened by the canoni-
cal projector on this ansatz, we nd that one half of the supersymmetry is
always preserved if the dilatino constraint is satised , but the other half is
conserved only if the function h, behaves as

h

(32)

therefore we found the possibility of enhancement for p = 3 only2.

2in principle we could try to generalized the function h to get this wanted behavior,
in fact there is an approach debt to jevisky and yoneya [5], where the string coupling
constant g is allowed to depend on the coordinates of the bulk geometry, such that the
function h behaves under a conformal symmetry as before. nevertheless although the

14

it is important to notice that the supersymmetries which are broken by
t-duality correspond to those which get enhanced in the particular case of
the d3-brane, i.e. the bilinear associated with the broken killing spinors,
are the conformal killing vectors.

in our previous analysis we have considered the two dual pairs (d3/d4)
and (d2/d3). both start with the d3-brane, with the only dierence that
the compactied dimension is or is not in the transversal direction. let

right transformation under conformal symmetry is archived by this type of generalizations,
only if g depends on the holographic variable u we will recover the decider behavior for
h. in any case, a new type of symmetry called the generalized conformal symmetry
(gcs) is dened. we found that once the string coupling constant g is not a constant,
the connection between the geometry and a non-linear sigma model is lost, as we dont
have a solution for the zero value of the sigma model beta function any more.

the situation for the near horizon geometries we are considering is a bit dierent, in
fact the solution for a d3-brane on a torus t s on its world volume and its treatment
to the nh limits gives a function h =
sriu 4 with the right dependence on u . the
full gcs of the corresponding near horizon geometry is recovered, as the action of the
conformal transformations of the near horizon d3-brane induce by t-duality on the nh
dp-brane. for example we have, for the innitesimal transformation corresponding to a
dilation acting on ads5

g2

s

u = 2u
xa = 2xa
g = 0

(33)

for the will-be coordinates on the t-dual geometries this transformation translate into,

also the action on the string coupling constant gives information,

(ri) = 2(ri)

g = 0   g2

y mys

rii! = 0  g2

y m = 2sg2

y m

therefore we get the following transformations,

u  u
xa
y m  sg2

note nevertheless, that this induce transformation is of a very queer type as it acts on the
moduli space and on the space time variables at the same time. under this circumstances
we dont believed this should be called a symmetry, at least in the usual sense. also on
the t-dual d-brane, related to the d3-brane, we have no enhancement of supersymmetry
due to the holonomy involved in this solutions. this is also understand as an efect of
t-duality breaking the will-be new supersymmetries.

us study a bit more carefully both pairs.
in the (d3/d4) case, the d4-
metric is characterized by two dierent moduli (g5, r). after the work in
matrix theory [9], it is natural to interpret g5 as related to the eleventh
dimension of m-theory and therefore to consider this metrics as coming
from a compactication of m-theory on a t 2, with sizes determined by the
two moduli g5 and r. also it is well known [10] that in the limit where
the volume of the two torus goes to zero, we should recover type iib theory.
this mechanism implies the dynamical generation of a quantum dimension
with the corresponding kaluza klein modes associated with the membrane
wrapped on the two torus. when we apply this mechanism to our case it
is natural to expect to get in the limit of zero volume for the two torus
(v ol(t 2)  0) the type iib d3-brane metric of equation (14). using the
relations (15) and (21) we observe that the limit v ol(t 2)  0 corresponds
to a ten dimensional type iib theory, where the extra quantum dimension
is the s1 circle in the limit v  , with the radius given by (15). the
up-lift of the d4-brane to m-theory gives us on m5-brane wrapped on a
circle determined by the value of g5. in addition to this, in our case we wrap
the m5-brane on another circle dening the two torus characterized by the
two moduli (g5, r). in the limit v ol(t 2)  0 what we get is the m5-brane
wrapped on a two torus of zero volume, that produce a d3-brane with the
extra dimension dening the transversional circle in the metric (14).

hence, the theory on the d4-brane gets embedded in the six dimensional
(2, 0) theory on the m5-brane. as is well known for the m5-brane, we get
enhancement of supersymmetry and therefore we can say that the d4-brane
theory will ow to a conformal point in strong coupling. in other words
what we observe is that, once we break the superconformal generators by t-
duality, the resulting theory naturally ows to recover the supersymmetry by
up lifting to m-theory.

let us now consider the t-dual pair (d2/d3). this is very similar to
the previous case. in the d2-brane metric the moduli is characterized by
(g3, v), which again should be interpreted as m-theory compactied on a
two torus of size g3 and v. in the limit when the volume of the two torus
goes to zero, we should recover the type iib-picture by exactly the same
mechanism described above. the d2-brane is now up lifted to a m2-brane
but contrary to what happens in the (d3/d4) case, the extra quantum
dimension becomes now part of the world volume dimension of the t-dual
d3-brane. more precisely what we observed is that the compact world
volume dimension in the metric (25) is the extra quantum dimension in
the type iib that we get when we compactify m-theory on the two torus
characterized by (g3, v). in other words, what we observe is that the t-dual

description in (25) of the uplifted d2-brane is a three dimensional theory
becoming four dimensional for strong coupling v  0 in equation (30).

as before with the (d3/d4) pair we also observe here that the theories
ow to reach superconformal invariance. notice that these two dual pairs
saturate the known examples of superconformal theories namely the d3-
brane, m2-brane and m5-brane. the (d3/d4) pair is related to the m5-
brane and the (d2/d3) pair to the m2-brane.

the previous conjecture is in contrast to the mechanism suggested in
[11] for solving the cosmological constant problem.
in that we can start
with a three-dimensional theory that is expected to ow in strong coupling
to a four-dimensional theory. massive particles in three dimensions are
associated with conical geometries, when some amount of supersymmetry
is broken. the suggested solution to the cosmological constant problem, is
based on the assumption that these supersymmetries are not restored in the
strong coupling four-dimensional limit. in our case, we have simply studied
supersymmetry generators associated with conformal transformations that
are the ones naturally broken by the action of t-duality, and we nd they
are restored in the up lifted m-theory limit.

the general picture emerging from the previous discussion is that once
we start with a superconformal theory, t-duality generally breaks the super-
symmetries associated with the superconformal transformations. however
the t-dual theory tends to ow to recover these supersymmetries broken by

17

t-duality up lifting to m-theory.

to be more precise, starting with a d3-brane with the world volume
compactied on a circle of radius r, we break for nite radius the super-
symmetries associated with those killing spinors depending on world vol-
ume coordinates. those are associated with the enhanced supersymmetry.
in order to decide if t-duality breaks supersymmetry or not, we perform a
t-duality to a d2-brane. once we have done that, we send the radius r to
innity. in this limit we recover for the d3-brane the whole superconformal
algebra. then if t-duality is not breaking supersymmetry we should nd
that the t-dual of the r   limit possesses enhanced superconformal
invariance. in fact this is what happened. by relation (30), when r  
then v  0 and g2
3 can be interpreted as 1/ for 
the size of the eleventh dimension. thus the d2-brane becomes uplifted to
m2-brane recovering the superconformal transformations. in a certain sense
m-theory is there to work out the breaking of supersymmetry induced by
t-duality.
