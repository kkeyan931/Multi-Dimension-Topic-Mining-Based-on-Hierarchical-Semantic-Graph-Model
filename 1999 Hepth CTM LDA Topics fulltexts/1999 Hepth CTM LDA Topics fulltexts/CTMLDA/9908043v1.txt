abstract

the non-perturbative renormalization group equation for the wilsonian eective po-
tential is given in a certain simple approximation scheme in order to study chiral symme-
try breaking phenomena dynamically induced by strong gauge interactions. the evolving
eective potential is found to be non-analytic in infrared, which indicates spontaneous
generation of the fermion mass. it is also shown that the renormalization group equation
gives the identical eective fermion mass with that obtained by solving the schwinger-
dyson equation in the (improved) ladder approximation. moreover introduction of the
collective eld corresponding to the fermion composite into the theory space is found to
oer an ecient method to evaluate the order parameters; the dynamical mass and the
chiral condensate. the relation between the renormalization group equation incorporating
the collective eld and the schwinger-dyson equation is also claried.

1. introduction

it has been a very important subject to understand the non-perturbative dynamics of
the quantum eld theories, especially the strongly coupled gauge theories like qcd. one
of the most outstanding features of the non-perturbative dynamics of qcd is spontaneous
breakdown of the chiral symmetry. so far, the approach by means of the schwinger-dyson
equations (sde) has been extensively studied [1, 2, 3] and been applied not only to the
strongly coupled qed and qcd [4, 5], but also to the models beyond the satandard
model [6, 7].
in this approach the so-called (improved) ladder approximation [4] has
been commonly applied to solve the sdes. it should be noted that the sdes oers us
surprisingly good results on the chiral symmetry breaking phenomena in qcd in spite
of the fact that the approximation scheme is fairly crude [5]. however it has been also
known that this sd approach suers from some problems: diculties in improvement of
the approximation [8], large gauge dependence in the ladder approximation [9], and so
on. therefore it would be desirable to develop other non-perturbative methods so as to
overcome such diculties, for example, in order to perform gauge independent study of
the chiral order parameters in qcd dynamics.

in the previous papers [10, 11], we proposed the wilson renormalization group equation
(rge) [12] for the system of a massless fermion coupled by gauge interaction, with which
we can study the critical behavior of the chiral symmetry in a remarkably simple manner.
in this rg approach it is enough to calculate the beta functions for the multi-fermi
couplings in order to evaluate the critical couplings, phase boundary and the anomalous
dimensions of the fermion composites near the critical points. specially the rg ows of
the four-fermi coupling play an essential role to show this critical behavior. the procedure
is quite straightforward in contrast to the calculations using the sdes. it should be noted
that the set of beta functions obtained in a certain approximation framework turns out to
be free from gauge dependence [10]. moreover, if we approximate these rges further by
restricting the radiative corrections to a certain limited type, which we called the ladder-
like corrections in [11], then it gives the same critical dynamics as obtained by solving the
ladder sde. therefore the above mentioned gauge independent analysis indeed oer us
an improvement of the ladder sdes. thus, it may be said that this wilson rg approach
is more powerful than the sd approach as long as the critical dynamics is concerned.

howeve the beta functions for the multi-fermi couplings do not tell us the order param-
eters in spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. therefore it is not known immediately
in which phase the chiral symmetry is broken, even after the critical behavior is claried
by the rges. actually the chiral symmetry breaking itself might look somehow puzzling
in the framework of the wilson rg. because the wilsonian eective action keeps chiral
invariant manifestly, and therefore the fermion mass seems to have no chance to appear
in it. on the other hand, the order parameters such as the dynamical mass of quarks, the
quark condensation, the -on decay constant, etc. are the relevant physical quantities to
be evaluated in qcd-like gauge theories, which are of our main concern. thus it is an
interesting and important problem to study not only the critical behavior but also the
chiral order parameters in this rg framework.

in this paper we discuss how the order parameters may be evaluated in the wilson
rg framework. for the sake of simplicity we adopt the simple approximation to take

1

only the ladder like corrections into account and propose a non-perturbative rge in
terms of the wilsonian eective potential. then the dynamical fermion mass is found
to appear through non-analitycity of the wilsonian eective potential in infrared instead
of an explicit mass term. also it will be shown that the rge gives the same eective
mass as the ladder sde does in the entire region of the coupling space. through this
analysis the structure of the ladder sde is also claried in the point of view of the non-
perturbative rg. thus any improvement of this approximation in the rg framework
exceeds the analysis done by the ladder sde so far. however the purpose of this paper is
to discuss the method to evaluate the order parameters in the wilson rg framework and
to make clear the relation to the sde, not to improve results for the order parameters
obtained so far. study of the order parameters beyond the level of the sd approach,
specially the gauge independent analysis, is currently under way.

this paper is organized as follows. section 2 is devoted to a brief review of the sde in
the so-called improved ladder approximation, which will be disscussed in relation to the
rge in the later sections. in section 3 the non-perturbative rge for the wilsonian eec-
tive potential is proposed. the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking will be examined
by solving the partial dierential equation for the eective potential. it will be seen that
in the chiral symmetry broken phase the non-analyticity comes out in the infrared eec-
tive potential. this singular behavior is found to indicate the dynamical generation of the
fermion mass. the relation between the rge and the sde is claried by an analytical
method in section 4. through this observation the improved ladder approximation used
in the sd approach will be understood from the point of view of wilson rg. however
the non-analytic behavior of the wilsonian eective potential makes it rather dicult to
evaluate the order parameters. in section 5 we are going to consider the practical method
to calculate the order parameters in this rg framework. in order to circumvent this prob-
lem we will propose a method incorporating the collective eld corresponding to the
composite operator of fermions in the theory space. this method will be found to enable
us to perform the calculation very eectively compared with the former rges. lastly
the results of the eective mass of quarks and the chiral condensate in massless qcd will
be presented using the rges in comparison with the results obtained in the ladder sd
approach. in section 6 we summarize our conclusions and also discuss the further issues
along the lines considered in this paper.

2. the ladder schwinger-dyson equation

first let us consider the massless qed extended so as to include the chiral invariant
4-fermi intreactions; namely the gauged namubu-jona-lasinio model [2, 3], which is given
by the bare action

s0 = z d4x (i/  ga/) 

1
4

f 2

 +

g
22

0 h( )2 + ( i5)2i .

(1)

this should be regarded as the action of the eective theory at scale 0, which is the
overall cut-o of this model. the 2-point function of the fermion s(p), which is of our
present interest in order to see chiral symmetry breaking, satises the sde written in
terms of the full photon propagator d(p), the full vertex function g(p, q) and s(p).
however the sde for the vertex cannot be given a closed form using only s, d and

2

g. therefore it is inevitable to approximate the sde in any practical analyses.

in the ladder approximation, which has been mostly used, the photon propagator d

as well as the vertex function g are simply replaced by the tree level ones;

g(p, q) = g

id(p) =

1

p2  g 

pp

p2 ! ,

(2)

where the propagator is given in the landau gauge. actually the results obtained in this
approximation have been known to depend on the gauge choice considerably [9]. however
the sde in the ladder approximation is supposed to be the best in the landau gauge,
since the ward identity z1 = z2 is maintained only in this gauge. indeed z1 = 1 by
neglecting corrections to the vertex and also z2 = 1 as is seen from the form of the
2-point function in the landau gauge,

is1(p) = p/  (p),

(3)

where (p) is the fermion self-energy i.e. the mass function.

the sde for the mass function  is found to be given by the integral equation (in

euclidean)

(k) = z|p|<0

d4p

(2)4 " g

3g2

4(k  p)2# tr

ip/ + (p)! ,

(4)

which was rst studied by bardeen et. al. [2]. it is seen from this equation that the mass
function may be evaluated as sum of bubble diagrams of the fermion loops which contain
the ladder corrections of photon exchange. the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking
is indicated by appearance of a non-trivial solution of the eq.(4). the structure of the
critical line in the space of the bare couplings (g,   g2/42) has been claried [3] and
the symmetry broken phase was found to be given by

g > 2(cid:16)1 +q1  /cr(cid:17)2

 > cr

for  < cr,
for g < 2,

(5)




where cr denotes the critical gauge coupling and is found to be cr = /3 [1].

the ladder approximation mentioned above, however, is so crude that the radiative
corrections to the gauge coupling are totally ignored. therefore we cannot apply the sde
(4) directly to the gauge theories such as qcd in order to obtain any physical results.
miransky and higashijima [4] have invented independently the scheme to incorporate the
correction to the gauge coupling to the sde eectively, which is called the improved
ladder approximation. this approximation is to simply replace the vertex g by

g = g(cid:16)max(p2, k2)(cid:17) t a,

(6)

where p and k are the euclidean momentum carried by the fermions attached to the
vertex, g(p2) is the running gauge coupling constant renormalized at the scale of p. also
t a denotes the color group representation of the fermion. the choice of the momentum

3

dependence in (6) is just for the practical reason to make analytical study easier. thus
the sde in the improved ladder approximation is written after the angle integration as

(k) =

1

22 z 0

0

dp p3"g +  (k)

k2 (k  p) +

(p)

p2 (p  k)!#

(p)

p2 + 2(p)

.

(7)

here we introduced the running gauge coupling dened by

(p) =

3
4

c2(r)g2(p),

(8)

where c2(r) is the second casimir of the color representation r. we may use the running
gauge coupling evaluated by perturbation in the sde, provided an infrared cuto of
running is performed to (p) in order to avoid the divergent pole. fortunately it has been
found that the physical quantities are almost independent of this infrared cuto [5].

indeed the scheme in the improved ladder approximation makes it possible to study
qcd-like gauge theories. besides it has been known that the sde (and also the bethe-
salpeter equations) in this scheme leads to the order parameters for dynamical chiral
symmetry breaking in qcd in a rather good accuracy [5]. however this method to use
the running gauge coupling deviates from the scheme of sde, and therefore, it cannot
be regarded as a systematic improvement of the approximation. hence we cannot help
but stopping more or less in this level of analyses. however it will be seen later that this
manipulation is understood as a quite natural improvement of the approximation in the
framework of non-perturbative renormalization group rather than in this sd approach.

3. the wilsonian eective potential and the rg equations

there have been known several formulations of the non-perturbative rg or the so-
called exact renormalization group equations [12, 13, 14]. in this paper we discuss the
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking phenomena only in the framework of the wegner-
houghton rge [13] for our present purpose. this rge gives the variation of the so-called
wilsonian eective action dened by sharp cuto under the innitesimal shift of the cuto
scale. as is seen later this sharp cuto scheme makes it easier to clarify the relation
between the non-perturbative rges and the sdes, though the physical consequencies
should not depend on the choice of cuto scheme of course.

before discussing the rge for the system considered in the previous section, let us
mention briey the general formulation of the wegner-houghton rge. if we devide the
freedom of the quantum eld (p) into the higher momentum modes with |p| >  and the
lower momentum modes with |p| <  by introducing the cuto scale  in the euclidean
formalism, then the wilsonian eective action at this scale, se[; ], may be dened by
integrating out the higher frequency modes in the partition function. namely

z = z y|p|<0

d(p) es0[;0] = z y|p|<

d(p) ese[;],

(9)

where s0 denotes the bare action with the bare cuto 0. this eective action contains the
general operators consistent with the original symmetries of the bare action, for example
the chiral symmetry of our concern. interestingly enough the innitesimal variation of

4

the eective action with respect to the cuto  may be evaluated exactly. after taking
account of the scale transformation of dimensionful variables the wegner-houghton rge
is found to be

where t = ln(0/) is introduced as the scale parameter. the 1st line of the rge
represents nothing but the scaling of the eective action. i/2 denotes the anomalous
dimension of the eld i. while the 2nd line comes from the radiative corrections which
correspond to the tree and the one loop feynman diagrams including only the propagators
with the momentum of the scale . however this rge is a rather formal object, though
it has been derived exactly.
it is inevitable to simplify this rge by applying some
approximations in practical analyses.

now we shall consider the non-perturbative rge for the system given by the bare
action (1) in the approximation scheme, which will be found to correspond to the ladder
approximation applied to the sde. in the process to derive the rge, the scheme of this
approximation will be dened. first we adopt the so-called local potential approximation
(lpa) [13, 15], in which the radiative corrections to any operators containing derivatives
are ignored. therefore solely the potential part of se may be evolved with respect to
the cuto scale. it should be noted that the wave function renormalizations, therefore
the anomalous dimensions also, are ignored in this scheme. first let us also ignore the
corrections to the operators including the gauge eld. in the wilson rg framework the
gauge invariance is necessarily lost by introducing cuto, though the chiral invariance is
maintained. this problem makes it rather complicated to deal with gauge theories gener-
ally. recently the formulations of the wilson rg utilizing the slavnov-taylor identities
have been developed and been examined in the application to the yang-milles theories
[16]. however in the present approximation we avoid this problem just by ignoring such
corrections. one the other hand we do not get the radiative corrections to the gauge
interaction at the price of this approximation, which is in the same level as of the ladder
sde. treatment of the running gauge coupling will be discussed later.

as the result of the approximation disscussed so far, the form of the wilsonian eective

action at scale  is restricted to

se[, , a; ] = z d4x (/ + ga/) + v (, ; ) +

(a)2,

(11)

where v is the general potential invariant under the chiral symmetry. the last term
in (11) is the gauge xing term and we also adopt the landau gauge hereafter. the
potential v may be written down as a polynomial composed of the following parity and
chiral invariant operators, which are mutually independent;

o1 = ( )2 + ( i5)2 = 

1

2 n( )2  ( 5)2o ,

5

o2 = ( )2 + ( 5)2,

(12)

o3 = n( )( 5)o2

.

now the innitesimal variation of the eective potential v (, ; ) under the shift of

the cuto      is given by

v (, ; ) = z<|p|<
= z<|p|<

bb denotes the photon propagator in the landau gauge. note that the com-
bbmbf in eq.(13) represents the eective 4-fermi interactions induced

by one photon exchange.

in the previous paper [11] we examined the critical dynamics of chiral symmetry
breaking in this level of approximation. however it was found that this approximation
is still better than the ladder approximation in the sd approach as far as the critical
dynamics is concerned. in other words this correction contains the contributions from the
non-ladder diagrams not only from the ladder diagrams. here we shall simply extract
the ladder-like corrections only by imposing further restriction to the eective potential.
we consider the eective potential v composed of only the operator o1 given in (12),
and pick up only the parts propotional to 1 or 5 in the spinor structure from the vertices
appearing in nf f  mf f  mf bm 1
bbmbf . after performing the erz transformation
the resultant matrix is simply reduced to be

nf f = 


0

ip/ + ( + i5)(v  3g2
4p2 )

ip/t  ( + i5)(v  3g2

where the notations  = ,  = i5 and  = (2 + 2)/2 are introduced. 1 thus we
obtain the non-perturbative rge in the ladder approximation as

1 this matrix (15) in lpa is evaluated simply by setting the lower momentum modes to zero modes,
however there arises a subtle problem related with their grassmann nature. the eective potential
evaluated by the exact zero modes must terminate at a certain nite order, unless we consider the large
nf limit. however such zero mode parts do not represent the bulk structure of the general green functions
of fermions. here we suppose that the correction to the eective potential is evaluated in small momentum
limit with keeping  nite rather than by the exact zero modes, and that the eective potential v is
given by an innite order of polynomial in terms of  = (p)(p) and  = (p)i5(p). the sharp
cuto limit is taken by  > |p|  0.

after taking account of the canonical scaling. indeed it will be shown that analysis of this
rge results in the identical eective mass, which is dened shortly, to the solution of the
ladder sde (4).

before discussing the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, let us briey mention
the critical surface derived from this rge. if we expand the eective potential v () into
a polynomial,

v (; t) = g(t) +

g8(t)2 +

g12(t)3 +    ,

(17)

and substitute this into the rge, then the beta functions for the couplings are easily
obtained. for the 4-fermi coupling g we nd

22 (cid:18)g +

(cid:19)2

.

(18)

here we note that the higher order couplings are not involved in the evolution of the 4-
fermi coupling due to 1-loop nature of the non-perturbative rge. this rge (18) shows
the xed points (line) at

g() = 2(cid:18)1 q1  /cr(cid:19)2

,

(19)

where + () sign is for the uv (ir) xed points respectively. thus the phase boundary,
which is shown in fig.1, is found to just coincide to the result of the ladder sde given
in eq.(5). the anomalous dimension of the four-fermi operator is immediately obtained
from this rge [11], which is also shown to agree with that derived from the sde (4)
[3]. however it is not obvious whether the chiral symmetry is truly broken spontaneously
in the upper region of the phase boundary in fig.1, since the order parameters of chiral
symmetry are not obtained in such rg analyses.

let us consider the eective mass of the fermion, which is the direct result obtained
by solving the sde. in the rg framework the wilsonian eective action keeps its chiral
invariance under evolution. therefore the eective mass cannot appear as the mass term
of this action. on the other hand the eective mass me enters into the loop correction
may be read from the eective interaction given in eq.(15) as

me = lim

if we are allowed to expand the eective potential into a power series as in (17), namely,
if the potential is a regular function of  at the origin, then this eective mass cannot help
but vanishing. on the other hand it is found that each coupling actually keeps growing
very rapidly and eventually diverges in the broken phase. 2 this is nothing but infrared
singularity caused by massless particles. note that each beta function is given through
one loop diagrams with the massless fermion even in the chirally broken phase.

the above observation would imply that the expansion by the series of operators
becomes invalid in the infrared. hence we examined to numerically solve the partial

2in practice all the couplings diverge at a certain nite scale. this divergence occuring at a nite scale,

rather than in the infrared limit, is supposed to be caused by the naive approximation applied here.

in fig.2 evolution of the eective potential to
infrared is presented in the case of bare couplings g = 0,  = 1.5cr. actually it is
seen that the eective potential turns out to be non-analytic at the origin ( =  = 0).
therefore the eective mass given by eq.(20) is not well-dened.
if we introduce the
small bare mass of fermion, then the dynamical mass for the massless theory may be
dened by the vanishing limit and is found to get a nite value. anyway the dynamical
generation of fermion mass appears through the non-analytic behavior of the wilsonian
eective potential in infrared. actual evaluation of the eective mass and also the chiral
condensate will be discussed in section 5.

needless to say the approximation scheme for the non-perturbative rge considered
here is too clude to apply for the analysis of qcd-like gauge theories. it is necessary to
improve the approximation so as to incorporate the running eect of the gauge coupling
at least. as the lowest order approximation to the rge, the beta function for the gauge
coupling may well be estimated by the perturbative one. namely we solve the rge given
by eq.(16) coupled with the perturvative rge for . this may be regarded somehow as
a similar idea to the improved ladder approximation performed for the sdes. however it
is a clear advantage for the wilson rg approach to allow such improvement within the
same framework of rg in contrast to the sd approach.

also we need to take the color group representation into consideration in the case of
qcd-like gauge theories. suppose the fermions form an n dimensional representation.
then the 1-loop correction given by (13) is multiplied by the factor n. on the other hand
we have to take care of the erz transformation for the color indices as well as the spinor
indices to derive the eective interaction as given in eq.(15).

where the gauge coupling (t) is now subject to the perturbative rge. this rge will be
discussed in the comparison with the sde in the improved ladder approximation in the
next section.

4. the relation between the rge and the sde

in this section it is shown analytically that the rges, eq.(16) and eq.(22) proposed
in the previous section oer us the same eective masses as the sdes in the (improved)
ladder approximation do. our strategy to this end is as follows. first we give an analytical
expression for the wilsonian eective potential, which is expected to be the solution of the
rge. we dene also the mass function giving the eective mass introduced by eq.(20).
the essential point in deriving these analytical expressions is to introduce the bilocal

9

auxiliary eld. then it is shown that the mass function satises the (improved) ladder
sde as the stationary condition with respect to this auxiliary eld. on the other hand
we also conrm that the eective potential given in this method indeed satises the rge
discussed before.

the wilsonian eective potential is given by integration of the higher momentum
modes. in the following discussions we use ,  and a for the lower momentum modes,
which are treated as zero modes in evaluation of the eective potential. the higher mo-
mentum modes are expressed by p, p and ap respectively with index representing their
momentum. for the time being also let us abbreviate the four fermi interaction ( i5)2
just for simplicity. in the approximation scheme considered in the previous section, we
may give the following representation for the eective potential after integrating out a;

ev (;) = e g

2 2 z dd  es[, ;]

(23)

where  denotes the product of the lower (zero) momentum fermions  and  denotes
the space-time volume. s is the action for the higher momentum fermions with the
eective 4-fermi interaction induced by the photon exchange, which is given by

s = z

where k = k  p + p by momentum conservation. here we introduced the simlpied
notation for the momentum integration;

z 

p

 z<|p|<0

d4p
(2)4 .

(25)

now the eective 4-fermi interaction may be eliminated by adding the following term

with a bilocal auxiliary eld s(p, p) [17];

s,s =

2 z 
p z

3g2

4(k  p)2! (s(p, p)  pp) (s(k, k)  kk) .

(26)

then we are able to integrate out the fermionic freedoms with higher momentum,  and
. after performing the integration we obtain the wilsonian eective potential expressed
by the path integration over the bilocal auxiliary eld s;

ev (;) = e g

the ladder approximation considered in the analyses of the sde corresponds to the
mean eld approximation in the bilocal auxiliary eld method. namely the eective po-
tential in our approximation may be obtained by applying the saddle point method to
the path integral given in eq.(27). the stationary condition for the saddle point deter-
mines the expectation value of the bilocal eld, or the composite operator of the fermions
with higher momentum. then the bilocal auxiliary eld s is now reduced to the vev
depending on only the relative momentum,

s(p, p)  s(p) = h ppi,

(29)

because of the translationary invariance. consequently we can obtain the following an-
alytical expression of the wilsonian eective potential, which is expected to satisfy the
rge proposed in the preceeding section;

v (; ) =

(30)

where  denotes the eective mass function for the higher momentum modes, which is
dened as

(p; ) =  g +

3g2

4p2!  z 

k  g +

3g2

4(k  p)2! s(k).

(31)

note that this mass function depends on the lower momentum modes  as well as the ir
cuto . on the other hand the stationary condition with respect to s(p) is found to be

(p; ) =  g +

3g2

4p2!  z 

k  g +

3g2

4(k  p)2! tr 

1

ik/ + (k; )! .

(32)

the mass function  and also the auxiliary s are formally given in terms of  by solving
eq.(31) and eq.(32). therefore the wilsonian eective potential v may be regarded as
a function of  and . this set of the eqautions will be found to interplay between the
ladder sde (4) and the non-perturbative rge in our approximation scheme (16).

first let us examine the eective mass dened by eq.(20). by taking account of the

stationary condition eq.(32), we may deduce from the eq.(30) the following relation,

v


= g +z

4k2! tr

therefore the eective mass is found to be given in terms of  dened above by

(p; )|=0 .

on the other hand it is readily seen by setting  = 0 that the mass function (p; ) indeed
satises the ladder sde given by eq.(4) in the ir limit of  = 0. thus it is veried that

11

the eective mass obtained by solving the ladder sde is also derived from the wilosnian
eective potential given by (30).

next we shall conrm that the eective potential also satises the rge given by

eq.(16). again by using the stationary condition (32), we may obtain



v


= z

d4p
(2)4 (|p|  )tr ln[ip/ + (p; )].

(35)

here if we set |p| =  in eq.(32), then it is written down after performing the angle
integration of the momentum as

(|p| = ; ) =  g +

3g2

42!  

1

22 z 0



dk k3 g +

3g2

4k2!

(k; )

k2 + (k; )2 .

(36)

therefore the variation of the eective potential v (; ) given by eq.(35) may be repre-
sented in terms of the potential itself by using eq.(33) and is found to be



v


=

1

22 4 ln

2 + v 

3g2

42 !2
 .

(37)

thus it is seen that the eective potential derived through the above discussion indeed
satises the rge given in (16) after considering the canonical scaling transfaormation.

the sde in the improved ladder approximation also can be related to the rge by
the similar arguments given so far. in this case it is enough to replace the gauge coupling
appearing in the analytical expression of the wilsonian eective potential to the running
one; g2  c2(r)g2(max(p2, k2)). then it is now obvious that the eective mass function
 at  = 0 satises the improved ladder sde (7) in the ir limit. on the other hand the
variation of the eective potential is found to be given by



v


=

1

22 4 ln

2 + v 

3c2(r)g2(2)

42

!2
 .

(38)

here it should be noted that this variation may be given in terms of the potential owing
to the special choice of the momentum dependence of the running gauge coupling in (6).
since the argument of the running gauge coupling appearing in eq.(38) is simply given
by the cuto , we may realize that the eective potential is the solution of the coupled
equations of the non-perturbative rge given by eq.(22) and the rge for the gauge
coupling. thus it has been shown that the improved ladder approximation, which looks
rather articial in the sd approach, turns out to be the naive improvement by evaluating
the gauge beta function perturbatively in the non-perturbative renormalization group
framework.

in this section we discussed the relation between the non-perturbative rge and the
(improved) ladder sde via the wilsonian eective potential given by using the bilocal
auxiliary eld. however we should note that the above argument is rather formal. as a
matter of fact the ladder sde (4) is known to have many solutions corresponding to the
unstable states. therefore the solution of the rge for the eective potential might not be

12

uniquely determined at the singular point in the broken phase. we have not cleared this
point yet. it has been also known that the unstable solutions of the sde are related to the
appearance of the tachyon pole for the bilocal auxiliary eld [17]. more careful analyses
with taking the bound states into consideration would be necessary to understand the
unstable solutions in the sdes in the rg framework.

5. the rg equations with the collective eld

in section 3 we discussed the dynamical mass of the fermion appears through non-
analytic behavior of the eective potential in infrared. therefore in order to see the
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it seems to be necessary to deal with innetely
many operators, or to solve the partial dierential equation in practice, since otherwise
such non-analyticity does not come out. however it turns out to be rather dicult to
calculate the eective mass in a good accuracy with this manner. hence we might suppose
that the wilson rg approach is unsuitable for evaluation of the order parameters, while
it is indeed quite ecient to analyze the critical dynamics.

on the other hand the non-analytic behavior of the eective potential was found to
be related with the infrared singularity caused by the massless fermions. however the
fermions must acquire thier mass dynamically in the broken phase and, therefore, the
system should be free from the infrared singularity. then how can we treat the mass to
be generated in the rg framework with keeping its chiral symmetry? actually it will be
seen that this problem is resolved by introducing proper new operators into the theory
space.

our method is to extend the theory space by introducing the collective coordinate
corresponding the order parameter h i. concretely we simply introduce the collective
eld, which denotes , as an auxiliary eld in the original path integration. in this section
we discuss how the order parameters may be evaluated from the non-perturbative rge
dened in the extended space in the relation with the sdes. it will be shown that the
order parameters are calculated quite precisely by dealing with only several operators,
that is, by truncating the power series of the eective potential by a few terms. thus this
method will be seen to be much more eective than the naive wilson rg in the present
case.

in the followings we shall consider the qed with the 4-fermi interaction by abbrevi-

ating ( i5)2 part for simplicity. then we may rewrite the partition function as

z = z dd dades0[, ,a,],

(39)

where the bare action s0 is given by

s0 = z d4x (/ + ga/)

(40)

which is invariant under the discrete chiral transformation;

  5,

   5,

  .

(41)

here if we choose the yukawa coupling y so as to elimimate the four-fermi interaction, this
action may be regarded as the gauged yukawa system imposed the so-called compositeness

13

condition, which was rst examined by using the one loop rge by bardeen, hill and
lindner [18]. however it should be stressed that the collective coordinates are introduced
not for the purpose of making the perturbative treatment possible by eliminating the
4-fermi interactions, but to avoid the infrared singurality by reecting the dynamically
generated fermion mass faithfully to the rge. 3 note that we may treat the system
equally even in the case that the four-fermi interaction is absent in the bare action. it
is also noted that the resultant order parmeters should not depend on the choice of the
yukawa coupling introduced in the bare action.

first we shall derive the rge for this system in the same approximation scheme
considered in section 3. then the wilsonian eective action at the general scale of  will
be given by

se = z d4x (/ + ga/) + u(, ; ) +

1
4

f 2

 +

1
2

(a)2,

(42)

where the eective potential u is kept invariant under the chiral transformation (41). it
is noted that the collective eld  does not appear as a propagating mode through the
evolution due to the local potential approximation. actually it is found that the contri-
butions of these eld to the radiative corrections are totally ignored in the approximation
applied here. 4 therefore the rge is derived with just same argument done in section 3
and is found to be

u
t

= 4u  3u  u 

1

42 lnh1 + (u  3)2i .

(43)

thus the structure of the rge incorporating the collective eld has been reduced to
be of the same form as the rge considered so far due to this simple approximation.
nevertheless this formulation will be found to have a great advantage compared to the
former one.

first let us explain the way to evaluate the order parameters with this rge and the
numerical results. if we expand the eective potential u(, ; t) into a polinomial with
respect to  as

u(, ; t) = u (0)(; t) + u (1)(; t) +

1
2

u (2)(; t)2 +    ,

(44)

then eq.(43) is reduced to the rges for the functions u (i)(; t). in the chiral symmetry
broke phase the potential u (0)() will be found to show its non-trivial minimum at a
certain scale under evolution, 5 and the collective eld acquires the vacuum expectation
value hi. shortly it will be shown that hi is related with the chiral condensate by

h i =

1
y

hi,

(45)

3in this sense our formulation is a sort of the environmentally friendly renormalization group, which

has been proposed by oconnor and stephens [19].

4 for the njl model this scheme is nothing but the large n leading approximation.
5 the wilsonian eective potential is shown to coincide in the infrared limit with the conventional
eective potential dened by the legendre transformation, which must be convex [20]. however the rg
given eq.(43) leads us to evolution into the concave one due to the naive approximation adopted here.
this behavior is related with the divergence of the rg ows at a nite scale disscussed in section 3.

14

which is independent of the yukawa coupling y. the point of this method is to solve the
rge at the absolute minimum of this potential u (0)(). 6 there the fermion propagates
with the eective mass appearing through the linear term with respect to  as

me(t) = u (1)(hi; t).

(46)

thus we may avoid the problem of the infrared singularity. the rg ows are subject to
the canonical scaling at the scale lower than the eective mass. indeed the eective mass
me = me(t  ) obtained in this method will be shown to coincide with the results
in the ladder sd approach.

in the practical analysis we may well truncate the series given by eq.(44) at a certain
order. the results are found to converge quite rapidly with increasing the number of the
couplings. in fig.3 the contour of the eective fermion mass obtained by this method
is presented in the space of the bare couplings (g, ) compared with the corresponding
results by numerical analysis of the ladder sde. it is clearly seen that they coincide with
each other perfectly as is expected from the analytical study done in the previous section.
the proof of this coincidence based on the rge with the collective eld (43) will be
also given shortly. we show also the eective mass generated in the pure gauge theories
compared with the sd results in fig.4. notice that the eective mass of the theory in
the very vicinity to the criticality is evaluated enough precisely. these observations may
convince us that the rg method is quite ecient in analyses of the composite order
parameters as well as the critical behavior in the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.

in the primitive approximation scheme applied here, which reproduces the results
obatined by solving the (improved) ladder sde, any radiative corrections by the collective
eld has been ignored. however the collective eld introduced just as an auxiliary in the
bare action becomes the propagating degree of freedom as an bound state with evolution.
therefore it will be signicant to improve the approximation so that the colective eld
is incoporated as the dynamical variable. 7 for this purpose the analysis in the scheme
beyond the local potential approximation will be necessary.

now we shall show along the argument done in the previous section that the order
parameters, i.e. the eective mass and the chiral condensate, are really independent of the
yukawa coupling and also accord with the sd results. for the time being  and  denote
the lower momentum modes, which are treated as zero modes. since the collective eld
does not contribute to the radiative correction at all, we may immediately written down
the wilsonian eective potential u(, ; ) by introducing the bilocal auxiliary eld;

6 there found two absolute minima correspondingly to the discrete chiral symmetry. if the small bare

mass is introduced, the absolute minima is uniquely determined.

7the non-perturbative rges for the higgs-yukawa theories have been examined for study of the

triviality mass bound in the standard model [21].

we note that the mass function depends on not only  but also  in turn. it is staight-
forward to see that the eective potential u(, ; ) dened by these equations satises
the non-perturbative rge (43) indeed. however the relation to the ladder sde is not
obvious due to the presence of the collective eld .

by solving the rge (43) we may obtain the eective potential u(, ) as the infared
limit. however the eective mass is dened through the eective potential in terms of the
fermion, v (; ) as is given by eq.(20). in order to derive this eective potential from
u(, ) we have to integrate out the collective zero mode ;

ev () = z deu (,).

(50)

however we may well evaluate this integral by the saddle point method at the absolute
minimum of the potential u in the infrared (innite volume) limit. then  is given by a

function in terms of  after solving the stationary condition of u;

(51)

let us represent the formal solution for this equation by (). by using this the eective
potential in terms of the fermions is given by v () = u((), ). on the other hand the
minimum of the potential u (0), which was denoted by hi above is nothing but

hi = ( = 0) = yz

d4p

(2)4  tr

1

ip/ + (p)!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

(52)

first we shall consider the eective mass function (p) which should be subject to the
ladder sde in the infrared limit. note that the collective coordinate  in the stationary
condition (49) is now given by (). therefore by setting  = 0, we may obtain the
eective mass function as

(p) = yhi +z

3g2

4(k  p)2!  tr

1

ik/ + (k)!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

.

(53)

after substituting the expressoin for hi given by eq.(52) into this equation, it is readily
seen that the eective mass indeed satises the ladder sde and, therefore, is independent
of the free parameter y.

now it is seen that the order parameters dened by eq.(45) and eq.(46) in the context
of the rg are just the same quantities given by the ladder sde, and, therefore, are
independent of y. coincidence of the eective mass is shown by the relation

dv ()

d (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

= lim
t

u(, ; t)



(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=hi,=0

= lim
t

u (1)(hi; t) = me.

(54)

we note also that this eective mass is the momentum independent part of the the mass
function given by eq.(53); me = (0). from eq.(52) we see that the chiral condensate is
given by h i = hi/y. since the mass function has been shown to be independent of
y, the chiral condensate is found to be so. thus the non-perturbative rge incorporating
the collective eld (43) also has been shown to oer the order parameters in the ladder
approximation.

this method is found to be ecient equally in the analysis of the dynamical chiral
symmetry breaking in qcd-like gauge theories. the order parameters may be evaluated
by solving the rge given by eq.(43) with the running gauge coupling imposed a proper ir
cuto. the bare cutto scale 0 should be large enough compared to the dynamical scale
of the theory. now it would be expected that this method using the non-perturbative
rge should reproduce the identical results with those obtained by using the improved
ladder sde, as long as we atopt the same ir cuto to the running gauge coupling. in fig.5
the results of the dynamical mass of quarks me = (0) as well as the chiral condensate
h i obtained by the both method are shown in the case of su(3) qcd with three
triplet massless quarks. from this gure we may realize the eciency of this rg method,
with the collective led, since the results converge quite rapidly against truncation of the

which has been known to oer the  decay constant of the experimental value f =94mev
[5]. the chiral condensates are renormalized at 1gev.

6. discussions

in this paper we have proposed non-perturbative rges by which we can analyze the
order parameters for the chiral symmetry breaking dynamically induced by strong gauge
interactions. the rge was derived in the simple approximation scheme, which exactly
accords with the ladder approximation mostly used in the sd approach. moreover the
so-called improved ladder approximation performed in the sd framework has been under-
stood as the very natural and simple extension of the rge. the spontaneous symmetry
breaking is found to appear through the non-analyticity of the infrared eective potential
in the naive wilson rg picture. we have proposed also the scheme of the non-perturbative
rg extended so as to incorporate the collective coodinate corresponding to the composite
order parameter in order to avoid the infrared singularity. this extended rge is quite

18

ecient in the practical evaluation of the order parameters, which was demonstrated by
the calculation in the case of the massless qcd.

throughout of this paper we have been discussing in a quite simple approximation
scheme in order to make clear relation with the sd approach. now it has been found
that any improvement of this approximation enable us to go beyond the analyses by
the (improved) ladder approximation. as far as the critical dynamics is concerned, it has
been achieved so as to incorporate the non-ladder diagrams in the previous works [10, 11].
we should stress that the gauge dependence, which has been a serious problem in the
sd approach [9], remarkably disappears by taking account of the non-ladder diagrams
[10]. therefore it seems to be important to extend the analyses for the order parameters
presented in this paper to the better approximation scheme including the non-ladder
corrections.

another interesting problem in the non-perturbative rg study would be the bound
states and the composite particles. in this paper we have introduced the collective eld
 representing the fermion composite operator. it is naturally expected that this eld
is closely related to the composite particle. recently the appearance of the composite
particle has been vigorously studied in the non-perturbative rg framework [22]. it would
be extremely fascinating problem to describe the transition of the eective degree of
freedom in qcd, quarks to hadrons, in the wilson rg picture.
