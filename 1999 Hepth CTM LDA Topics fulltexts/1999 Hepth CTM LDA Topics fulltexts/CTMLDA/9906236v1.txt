abstract

we show that in certain limits the (1+1)-dimensional massive thirring model
at nite temperature t is equivalent to a one-dimensional coulomb gas of charged
particles at the same t . this equivalence is then used to explore the phase structure
of the massive thirring model. for strong coupling and t  m (the fermion mass),
the system is shown to behave as a free gas of molecules (charge pairs in the
coulomb gas terminology) made of pairs of chiral condensates. this binding of
chiral condensates is responsible for the restoration of chiral symmetry as t  .
in addition, when a fermion chemical potential  6= 0 is included, the analogy with
a coulomb gas still holds with  playing the role of a purely imaginary external
electric eld. for small t and  we nd a typical massive fermi gas behaviour
for the fermion density, whereas for large  it shows chiral restoration by means of
a vanishing eective fermion mass. some similarities with the chiral properties of
low-energy qcd at nite t and baryon chemical potential are discussed.

1 introduction

the massive thirring (mt) model in two space-time dimensions has been widely studied
as a toy counterpart to low-energy qcd, since it does not include many of the complica-
tions arising in 3+1 dimensions. amongst the features shared by the mt model and qcd
is hadronisation (bosonisation). in this primitive version, the mt model is equivalent to
the sine-gordon (sg) model, both at zero and non-zero temperatures [1, 2, 3]. viewed
as a non-linear sigma model (nlsm) in 1+1 dimension for a single goldstone boson with
an explicit symmetry breaking term, the sg model mimics the chiral lagrangian for

low-energy, strongly coupled qcd (whose role is played here by the mt model) where
the lowest energy excitations of the vacuum are the goldstone bosons. in addition, the
solitonic excitations of the sg model (kinks, for brevity) correspond to thirring funda-
mental fermions and hence they are the analogue of qcd baryons or, alternatively, the
nlsm skyrmions [4].

this paper is the second in a series concerning the statistical mechanical features
of those models. in [3], the mt/sg system and their equivalences (bosonisation) were
analysed at nite temperature t > 0 and non-zero fermion number chemical potential
it was shown that when there is a non-zero net fermion number in the mt
 6= 0.
model, a topological term arises in the dual sg model which counts the number of
kinks minus antikinks [3]. physically this term represents the thermal bosonisation of
fermions into kinks and it reects the existence of pure fermion excitations in the thermal
bath. the same term appears in the exactly solvable massless thirring model [5], and
a similar contribution for a nonzero baryon chemical potential in the low-energy qcd
chiral lagrangian was obtained in [6]. however, the massless thirring model, dual to the
schwinger model, has a much less rich and relevant structure if we have qcd in mind,
and we shall not consider it here, except as a limiting case.

the purpose of the present paper is to analyse the thermodynamics of the mt model,
calculating physical quantities such as the pressure, the fermion condensate (the order
parameter of the chiral symmetry) and the fermion number density. we believe this to
be important for obtaining a better understanding of crucial physical phenomena such as
the qcd chiral phase transition, not only at nite temperature but also at nite baryon
density [7].

we now introduce the model. in euclidean space-time with metric (+, +) the la-

grangian density of the mt model is

lm t [ , ] =  (6  + m0) +

1
2

g2j(x)j(x).

here  is a two-component fermionic eld, the 0 subscript denotes bare quantities and
j(x) = (x)(x) where the euclidean  matrices may be found in [3]. for g2 > 0
forces are attractive and the theory is super-renormalisable. for 1/2 < g2/  0,
further renormalisations need to be carried out as discussed in reference [8] for example,
whereas for g2/  1/2 the theory is no longer renormalisable [9]. throughout this
paper we take g2 > 0 unless otherwise stated. with qcd in mind we are interested in
strong coupling. in this we are aided by the general result that the natural parameter in
which to express results is (1 + g2/)1. this is understood by the explicit nature of the
duality with the sg model, with lagrangian density

lsg[] =

where  is a real scalar eld. recall that these models are equivalent only in the weak
sense, i.e. for vacuum expectation values and thermal averages, provided that their renor-
malised constants are related through [1]

where  is the renormalisation scale and m the renormalised mass at that scale. thus
large positive g2 corresponds to small 2, for which approximations can be well controlled.

with qcd in mind, we will be interested in the chiral properties of the mt model as
well as of physical quantities such as the pressure. the chiral u(1) transformations are
  exp(ia5) for the fermions and    + a/ for the bosons with a real arbitrary.
the massless thirring model is chiral invariant but the fermion mass term breaks that
symmetry explicitly. similarly the free boson theory is chiral invariant, whereas the
cos  term in the sg model breaks it. both models have still a residual zz invariance,
corresponding to the choice a = 2n with n any integer. it is important to remark that
in two space-time dimensions, the breaking of a continuous symmetry (u(1)  zz in
this case) cannot be spontaneous [10]. the u(1) and zz symmetries are, respectively, the
counterparts of the chiral and isospin symmetries for qcd, 0 and  playing the role
of the pion mass squared and the inverse of the pion decay constant respectively in the
eective chiral lagrangian to lowest order, i.e. the nlsm [11]. these generalities apart,
the identication (1.1) which, for strong coupling becomes g  2, is the only attribute
of the sg theory that we shall use. depending on which is most convenient, we shall
switch between the use of g and . this is not to say that the sg model has no interest
in its own right. it fact, it is an ideal testbed for summation schemes for the pressure
and, as such, will be considered elsewhere [12]. it is also of direct relevance to the study
of kinks in josephson junctions [13].

in order to make progress we comment on a further property of the 2d mt model
that also has a counterpart in qcd: at t = 0 and  = 0 it is also equivalent to a
2d classical statistical-mechanical system which consists of non-relativistic particles of
charge q (a coulomb gas) at a temperature tcg [8, 14]. before clarifying the form of
this analogy, we comment that one of the aims of this paper is to understand whether
a similar equivalence holds when the mt model is heated to a non-zero temperature t
and for  6= 0. if it does, we will then be able to use the simpler coulomb gas system to
explore its phase space. it has not yet proved possible to perform similar calculations for
qcd, as represented in [15], in which the coulomb gas is composed of monopoles.

indeed, one of our conclusions is that at high temperature t , the mt model can be
equivalent to a one dimensional coulomb gas of particles at the same temperature t .
this is not the case for the t = 0 mt model, for which

tcg =

2q2
2

leading to a kosterlitz-thouless (metal-insulator) transition at 2 = 8 [14]. the 1d
coulomb gas model has been solved exactly [16, 17] and we use those results to extract
information on the behaviour of observables such as the pressure and chiral condensate
of the mt model. furthermore, when  6= 0 in the mt model, we show that the analogy
with a 1d coulomb gas still holds with  playing the role of a purely imaginary external
electric eld.

this paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we analyse the conditions under which
the equivalence which a 1d coulomb gas holds. having specied this dimensionally
reduced regime, the exact link between the parameters of the dierent models is then
specied in section 3 where the pressure of the mt model is also calculated. section 4
is concerned with the fermion condensate. we see that for large g and t  m, the mt
model behaves as a free gas of molecules made of pairs of chiral condensates. this
binding of chiral condensates is responsible for the restoration of chiral symmetry as
t  , and no phase transition takes place. the eects of a fermion chemical potential
 6= 0 on the pressure and fermion density are discussed in section 5.

and l is the length of the system. we will eventually take the thermodynamic or l  
limit in all our results. it must be claried though that the l   limit will be taken
always keeping  nite. in fact, we will see explicit examples below in which the l  
and t  0+ limit do not commute. finally, the q variable in (2.2) also appears in the
nite temperature free massless boson and fermion propagators [2] and is given by

q2(q,  ) = sinh(

(q + i )



) sinh(

(q  i )



)

(2.3)

betraying its conformal origins. as discussed in [3], the integrals in (2.1) are convergent
for g2 > 0.

equation (2.1) will be our starting point here. first, notice that

q2(q,  )

exp

2|q|

|q|

.

(2.4)

the key observation is therefore that if we were allowed to replace the q2 functions in
(2.1) by their asymptotic values (2.4) then, with appropriate denitions, (2.1) would
resemble the grand canonical partition function of a one-dimensional classical gas of
charged particles with positions labelled by qi. remember that the two-particle coulomb
potential for charges  at points q1 and q2 on the line is v  2|q1  q2|. this 1d
coulomb gas system was studied a long time ago [16, 17] and it can be solved exactly.
we shall explore this analogy later on in section 3 and use the exact results to calculate
the pressure and chiral condensate of the mt model.

before doing so, however, we need to establish the conditions under which the replace-
ment given in (2.4)which we will denote dimensional reduction (dr)can be safely
made. this dr regime is the 2d analogue of more complicated situations analysed in

4

the thermal eld theory literature, which roughly works for high temperatures and large
distances [18, 19, 20].

clearly the regions in the integrand (2.1) where the replacement (2.4) is not allowed
in those regions the dominant contributions to the

are those where |qj  qk|  /.
integral come from xj  xk with jk = 1 since

q2(q,  )  (t )2(q2 +  2)

for

(q,  )  (0+, 0+).

thus, on the one hand, we expect that for high enough t the contribution (arising in
the denominator) can be neglected. on the other hand, the above contributions become
more important as g2 decreases, so that one may also think that for large enough g2
the approach could be equally justied. bearing these considerations in mind, we shall
analyse the limits of high t and large g2 separately in sections 2.1 and 2.2.

before proceeding, two comments are in order regarding the expression (2.1). first,
every term in the n-sum picks up an overall l factor. in other words, the number of
two-dimensional independent variables in the integral is actually 2n  1. this is most
easily seen by changing variables to

z1 = x1  x2, z2 = x2  x3, . . . , z2n1 = x2n1  x2n, z2n = x2n

(2.5)

so that in (2.1)

xj  xk =

k1

xi=j

zi

and therefore the integrand is independent of z2n, which yields the l factor. notice
that this is typical of closed loops in perturbation theory [21]. order by order one has
to consider all possible connected closed diagrams for the partition function and the l
factor is just the consequence of total energy-momentum conservation. one should bear
in mind that the physically relevant object is not the partition function but the pressure,
dened in the thermodynamic limit as

p = lim
l
which behaves as an intensive quantity.

l

log zm t (l, t )

(2.6)

the second comment concerns the scale dependence. the partition function (2.1) is
scale independent (and so is the pressure) since the explicit dependence on the renormal-
isation scale  is exactly cancelled by the implicit dependence of the mass m() (see [3]
for details). thus, unless otherwise stated and whenever dealing with scale-independent
objects in the following, we will choose for convenience  = m, the renormalised mass of
the thirring fermion.

2.1 high t limit
let us rescale qj  qj and j  j j in (2.2)1. then all the relevant t dependence
is now outside the integrals in (2.2) since in the thermodynamic limit  = l/   the
integrals are nite as long as 2 < 4excluding of course the  overall factor mentioned
above. then, choosing  = m, the series in (2.1) yields eectively a perturbative series
in (m2/t 2)(+2g2)/(2+2g2) = (m2/t 2)12/8:

we have evaluated numerically f2() and the result is plotted in figure 1. we see

that it remains of o(1) until very close to the limiting case 2/4<1, or g2>0, where it
diverges. thus, the relative error for t  m 2 is at least of order (m/t )2 and we can
therefore conclude that for t  m, dr is valid for g2 > 0.

we would now like to study the pressure for g2/  1 (2/4  1). the rst observation
is that the integrals in (2.2) diverge if we set  = 0 and then take the limit l  .

numerical analysis of the function i() shows that it clearly vanishes as   . there-
fore we have pm t = o(4). although it might seem that this result is valid for any
t , one has to be extremely careful when approaching the limit t  0+.
in fact, we
see that expanding (2.10) in  yields logarithmic factors log t /m hidden in the o(4)
in (2.12), but which will show up at next-to-leading order. therefore the above results

will recover in the coulomb gas approximation in section 3.

7

should not be trusted for temperatures t  m. this is just a consequence of the non-
uniformity of the t  0+ limit or, in other words, that the l   and t  0+ do not
commute in general. hence we will consider that our approach is justied for large g2/
and t >m. recall that the presence of the log t /m factors in the  expansion may be

also troublesome for very large t , which gives a hint that the high t limit may not be
compatible with perturbation theory, as has been noticed in more complicated situations
[23]. in our case though, we have a well dened high t expansion, namely our expansion
in (m2/t 2)12/8 discussed in section 2.1, which we will indeed be able to resum in the
dr regime.

to summarise, the results of this section are that the range of validity of the dr

approach which we will be considering for the pressure is

(2.13)

we now turn to the 1d coulomb gas system and specify exactly the link between it and
the mt model.

3 the mt partition function as a coulomb gas

consider the partition function for a one-dimensional neutral classical non-relativistic gas
of charged particles. in particular, take n positively charged particles and n negative
ones, where the magnitude of the charge will be denoted by . in one dimension, these
charges interact via a coulomb potential proportional to 2 and to the distance between
them on the line. this system can be also interpreted as uniformly charged plane sheets
moving along the direction normal to their planes [16, 17]. then, the partition function
in the grand canonical ensemble at xed temperature , fugacity z and length l is [16, 17]

(z, , , l) =

(3.1)

where i = 1 for i  n and i = 1 for i > n. the fugacity is related to the chemical
potential  by z = 2m exp 1, where m is the mass of the particles4. however,
we will keep z instead of  here, so as not to confuse this chemical potential with the
fermion chemical potential we will introduce in section 5. in the thermodynamic limit
the pressure and the mean particle density are given by

p (z, , ) = lim

n(z, , ) =  2n

that by making the replacement (2.4) in (2.1) and setting  = m, one can write5

4this denition of fugacity diers from the usual one by the factor of m . we have absorbed this

factor into the denition here as m plays no role in future considerations.

5again we work rst with  and translate to g later.

8

this is the central equivalence of this paper.

its utility lies in the fact that the
above classical problem was solved analytically in references [16, 17]. there it was shown
that for small  the 1d coulomb gas behaves as a gas of free molecules, made up of
+ charges pairs bound together (since the mean kinetic energy is much smaller than
i) the pressure is
the mean potential energy). the main features of this phase are:
small compared to 22, which represents the pressure between + charges, and ii) the
probability density of nding a + pair within a given distance r is much bigger than
that of nding a ++ pair for distances r less than a typical molecule size, which on the
other hand is much smaller than the typical inter-particle distance. on the contrary, for
large  (when the mean kinetic energy is much larger than the mean potential energy) the
charges are completely deconned, forming an electrically neutral plasma of 2n free
particles, where the pressure is higher than in the molecule phase. the crucial point in
our case is that, from (3.2) we see that the unit charge grows with temperature (  t )
and therefore the above phases are going to be reversed (high t molecule phase and
low t plasma phase), as we shall now see in detail.

let us rst quote the result for the pressure in [17]6

p (z, , ) = 220" z
22#

where 0(z) is the highest eigenvalue of mathieus dierential equation

" d2
d2 + 2z cos # y() = y()

(3.3)

with y(+2) = y(). notice that (3.3) diers slightly from the notation customarily used
for mathieus equation (see for instance [22]), which is recovered by setting  = a/4,
z = q/4 and  = 2v. therefore, from (3.2) we obtain for the full pressure of the mt
model in the dr regime:

pm t (t ) =

t 2 + pc(t, )

the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the characteristic problem (3.3) are well known

very small z are

changing variables in (3.1) as qi  qi/22, we have (z, , , l) = (z/22, 2, 1, 221l) so

for small z, the system is in the molecule phase, whereas for large z it is in the plasma
phase. let us then consider three separate limiting cases:

i) g2   and t  mg/2: this is the very high t regime and we have z  1,
so that equations (3.6) and (3.5) give pc  m2(m2g2/42t 2), i.e. the coulomb
pressure vanishes at high t for large g2. this is the molecule phase described
in [16] in which the coulomb charges tend to pair, thus lowering the pressure. as
noted above, this unexpected behaviour of high temperature binding is just a
consequence of the fact that our coupling charge  in (3.2) increases with t .
besides, when adding the free term in (3.4), the total pressure is an increasing
function of t , behaving in the high t (and large g2) regime as a free gas of massless
fermions. this is indeed the rst indication that the molecule phase corresponds
in fact to a phase of asymptotic chiral symmetry restoration. the reason is that
we expect that if the chiral symmetry is restored, the system behaves roughly as
the massless case which is chiral invariant. in other words, we would expect the
eective fermion mass to vanish in the t   limit when the system tends to
restore the chiral symmetry.

ii) g2   but t  mg/2: now equation (3.7) gives pc  m2  mt /g. since
z  1, now we are in the plasma phase. notice that this same result, to leading
order, could have been obtained through our analysis for large g in section 2.2,
c.f. equation (2.11). again we note that to o(2) in the expansion of pc there
is a contribution proportional to 2m2 log(t /m) which prevents us from going to
t  m. this is another reason why in the small  (large g) regime we can only
trust dr for t >m, which is the region covered in this second case.

iii) 0 < g2  1 and 2t  m: we have now z  m/2t . again, z  1 and we are
in the molecular phase. remember that in this region we can only trust dr for
t  m. thus pc  m2/ so that the pressure tends to a constant value for high
t . actually, if we were able to push our results formally to g2  0 (2  4),
the pressure would start growing for large t . clearly, our previous calculations
in the mt model are not justied in this case, which at least would require extra
renormalisations. however, from the viewpoint of the coulomb gas only, there is
no particular problem with taking g2 negative. in other words, the dimensionally
reduced theory is uv nite. notice also that, as we make g2 more negative, the
coulomb correction to the free boson gas term becomes more and more important.

in particular, if we take g2/<  1/2 7, pc would grow quadratically with t , thus

being of the same order as the free contribution.

in figure 2 we have plotted pc(t ) in units of m for dierent values of g2. notice that,
as we have said before, we cannot claim that curve iv) corresponds to the mt model in
the dr regime. we are simply extrapolating the coulomb gas results to that point. as
for curve iii), we should intend it as the limit of the dimensionally reduced mt model for
very small but positive g2, where we can still trust our dr approach, as long as we look

temperature theory.

only to the t /m  1 tail of that curve. note also that pc(t ) is always a continuous
function of the temperature and thus we do not see a phase transition in t , consistent
with being in two dimensions. in figure 3 we plot the coulomb pressure and the total
pressure for g2/ = 1 in order to estimate the size of the coulomb gas correction to
the free gas.

4 the chiral charges and molecules

in the previous section we have exploited the analogy of our dimensionally reduced mt
partition function with that of a coulomb gas on the line in order to calculate the pressure.
in this section we will show that this analogy can be extended further, i.e. that it also
works in the same way for other observables. in particular, we will concentrate on thermal
averages of products of the operators

(x) =

1
2

(1  5)

since these account for the chiral properties of the system. under the chiral transfor-
mations discussed in the introduction, (x)  exp(2ia)(x); in other words, the 
operators have well dened  chiral charge. below we will show that in our coulomb gas
analogy they play the role of the charges, and the chiral invariant combination + will
then represent a molecule. thus by forming molecules, the system tends to restore
the chiral symmetry, i.e. it behaves as the massless theory where only + combinations
are allowed.

we will show below that the  correlators can be related with the 1d coulomb gas re-
duced density functions discussed in [17]. these functions are dened as follows: f(x)dx
denotes the probability of nding a  charge in the element dx; f+(x1, x2)dx1dx2 is the

11

figure 3: the total pressure and the coulomb pressure for g2/ = 1

joint probability of nding a + charge in dx1 and a  one in dx2, and so on. it turns out
that such density functions can also be exactly calculated [17]. we will only consider here
the one-point and two-point functions, which will provide information on the relationship
between coulomb molecule pairing and the chiral symmetry, as explained above.

4.1 the fermion condensate and chiral symmetry vs molecule

pairing

the rst correlator we will analyse is just the one-point function, i.e. the condensate of
. observe that  +  =    since the mt model is invariant under +  
where  = (1/2)(1  5) are the right and left-handed projections of the spinor eld
(   in the sg model). this is a parity transformation and has nothing to do with
the chiral transformations we have been discussing here. we shall implicitly make use of
this +   symmetry in the correlators throughout this section.
the scale invariant fermion condensate m    is the order parameter of the
chiral symmetry, exactly as the quark condensate in qcd. an immediate consequence
of the absence of a phase transition in 2d is that the fermion condensate cannot vanish
strictly at any temperature. on the other hand, for high temperatures t  m we would
expect that the mass scale m becomes irrelevant and thus the system would restore
the chiral symmetry, as indeed happens in the qcd chiral phase transition. this was
already suggested by our previous analysis of the pressure. we may therefore expect the
condensate to become smaller at large t but never to reach zero. however, we do not
expect chiral restoration for all positive values of g2. an indication that this may actually
be the case is the following. in the g2  0+ limit, the system should behave as a free
massive fermion theory. however, it is not dicult to see that for g = 0 the condensate
behaves for t  m as    (m/) log(t 2/m2), so that there is clearly no chiral

12

restoration in that case. therefore we expect that chiral symmetry restoration is lost as
the value of g2 is decreased. indeed, we have seen that behaviour already for the pressure,
where the coulomb correction to the massless term did not vanish for large t and for
very small g2.

we will now show that in the dr regime the fermion condensate can be calculated
exactly, thanks again to the analogy with the coulomb gas. in fact we do not need to
appeal to the density functions in this case since in the thermodynamic limit l   the
system is translationally invariant so that

m    = m


m

pm t (t ).

(4.1)

notice in particular that this implies that the regime in which we are allowed to replace
the qs by their dr values for the condensate will be the same as for the pressure, i.e,
(2.13).

thus we only need to dierentiate once in the expression obtained for the mt parti-
tion function in the dr regime to get the condensate. however, in order to clarify the
procedure we will follow for the two point correlator and to understand better the anal-
ogy between coulomb charges and chiral operators, let us relate the condensate with the
one-charge density functions f analysed in [17]. those functions are given by f+ = f
with

f+(z, , , l; x) =

where  is the partition function of (3.1). we see that in the l   limit, a simple shift

(4.4)

relation (4.4) is very interesting indeed since it supports the idea that the role of the
coulomb charges is played here by the  chiral correlators (in the dr regime). we will
elaborate further on this issue below.

as it was said above, the fermion condensate can be obtained either using the analogy
with the f functions or by dierentiating the pressure. we should then be able to rewrite
(4.4) as (4.1), which would be a consistency check of our results. for that purpose, all
we need to use is (4.3) and the equivalence between  and zm t found in the previous
section. in doing so it is important to leave the scale  unxed, since dierentiating with
respect to m is a scale-dependent operation. after multiplying by m the result becomes
scale independent, and we can safely x  = m. once that consistency check has been
performed, let us write the nal expression for the fermion condensate as

m   =

(4.5)

where 0(z) = d0(z)/dz and we have converted back to g2. remember that unlike the
partition function, there is no contribution to the condensate coming from the free bose
part since the free theory is chirally symmetric. therefore by taking into account the
asymptotic behaviour (3.6)-(3.7), we now analyse the same limiting cases considered for
the pressure in the previous section:

i) g2/  1 and t  mg/2: we have m     (m2/22)(mg/t )2. the
condensate vanishes asymptotically and hence the chiral symmetry is restored as
t  .

ii) g2/  1 and t  mg/2: now m     m2(2t /m)(1+g2/)1. this is the
behaviour for temperatures t >m. notice again that if we insisted on extrapolating
this behaviour to t = 0 we would nd    (t = 0) = 0, which is clearly
incorrect since we know that at t = 0 the chiral symmetry is broken. once more,
we remark that we should trust our result only for t >m due to the presence of

logarithms in the  expansion.

iii) 0 < g2  1 and m  2t : m     2m2/, so that the condensate tends
to a constant value at high temperatures (just as the pressure did), and there is
no chiral symmetry restoration. as we anticipated before, we do not expect chiral
restoration to take place for small g2. in turn, notice that the exact g2 = 0 limit
predicts that the condensate grows logarithmically for large t , while we get here
that it remains constant for g2 small. this is another sign of the special character
of the g2 = 0 case, where, as commented several times before, we cannot apply our
dr arguments because of the extra uv innities.

in figure 4, we have plotted the condensate as a function of the temperature for dierent
values of g2 and we can see the dierent asymptotic limits discussed above. it must be
stressed again that the g2 = 0 case plotted in that gure should be taken as g2 very small
but positive.

from the above discussion the following picture emerges: for large values of g2, the
system at high temperatures behaves like a gas of neutral molecules made of pairs of
chiral charges (chiral neutrality) and the chiral symmetry tends to be restored continu-
ously (i.e, no phase transition) and asymptotically as t increases. as we decrease g2, the
molecule phase tends to disappear in favour of the plasma phaseas was already

14

figure 4: the fermion condensate as a function of temperature in units of m, for dierent
values of g2

seen for the pressure. here the + and  correlators can be dierent from zero in chiral
non-invariant combinations and thus the chiral symmetry remains broken even for large
temperature.

consequently if we look now at the two-point correlators, we should see a tendency
of the system to increase the + correlator against the ++ one in the molecule
phase, i.e, for high temperatures and large enough g2. that will be the purpose of the
next section.

4.2 two-charge correlators and the screening length

as in the single charge case, the above functions depend only on x  y in the l  
limit (translation invariance). also, notice that f+ = f+ and f = f++ while for
brevity we have omitted the dependences on z, , , l. our task now will be to compare
(4.6)-(4.7) with the mt correlators at nite temperature;  +  and  ++ 
respectively. let us start with the + correlator. in [3], the following result was obtained:

 tc+(x)(y )  =

where j = + for j = 1, . . . , n + 1, j =  for j = n + 2, . . . , 2n + 2 and tc means contour
ordering along c = [0,i]. for convenience we have retained  in the exponents rather
than g. again, the above correlator depends only on x  y in the thermodynamic
limit. notice that we are using the same notation x and y both for one-dimensional and
two-dimensional variables; the meaning should become clear from the context.

as for the ++ correlator, it can be calculated through the same procedure followed
in [3] for the + correlators using the generating functional technique. notice that this
correlator is not chiral invariant, unlike the + one, which makes its analysis slightly
more involved, as explained in [3]. despite that, we obtain after renormalisation

note that the ratio

r(, t ; x) =  tc+(x)(0) 
 tc+(x)+(0) 

is scale invariantthis is the observable in which we are interested. however, before
proceeding further, we need to clarify how dr works for the above correlators. we begin

16

by noting that dr is not allowed for all values of xy in (4.8)-(4.9). in fact, performing
the (2) integrations, a factor [q2(x  y )]2/4 comes outside the integrals and it is clear
that the replacement (2.4) will be allowed for that factor only for q  /2, where q is
the spatial component of x  y . besides, our analysis for the partition function does
not imply that even inside the integrals in (4.8)-(4.9) such replacement can be done. the
detailed analysis (which follows a similar line to that of sections 2.1 and 2.2) can be found
in the appendix. here we simply summarise the result: the structure of the correlators
(4.8)-(4.9) makes it possible to reduce them dimensionally (inside the integrals) in the
large g2 (small ) limit but not in the large t one. if, in addition one works at large
distances q  /2, the the qs outside the integrals are also dimensionally reduced.
bearing this in mind, we shall proceed to evaluate these correlators in the dimensionally
reduced regime by exploiting again the analogy with the coulomb gas.

4.2.1 two-point correlators and the coulomb gas

given the conditions for dr to work for the correlators, let us now compare (4.8) with
(4.6) and (4.9) with (4.7). for that purpose we replace the qs inside the integrals in (4.8)
by their asymptotic values (2.4). in doing so, we have to remember that such replacement
is not allowed in general for the term j = n + 1, k = 2(n + 1) (see the above comment).
next, shift n  n  1 in the sum so that, comparing with (4.6), we get

 tc+(x)(0)  = (cid:18)1

where x = (q,  ), we have set y = 0 and we have also made use of (3.2). it is important
to point out that the overall factor t 2/m2 depends on  implicitly through m but does
not have explicit  dependence (we cannot x  for that factor), whereas the resti.e.
the function f+is scale independent and we have xed  = m only in that part.

following the same steps for the ++ correlator we now nd

(4.10)

once more, the main advantage of comparing with the coulomb gas is that the
functions f++ and f+ can be calculated exactly. they can also be related with the
mathieu equation (3.3) as [17]:

the l   limit has been taken, z = z/22, q = 22q/ and ym(), m are,
respectively, the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of (3.3), with m1 > m, m = 1, 2, . . ..
first, note that since m < 0 for m  1 and 0 > 0, only the b0 term survives in the
above sum in the limit q  . then, since y0() = y0(), we have f+  (b0)2 in
that limit. in fact b0 = z0(z). since in that limit we can also dimensionally reduce the
q2 factors in (4.10), we get

r(, t ; q  ,  ) = 1.

after conversion to g, our results for r(g, t ; x) are plotted in figure 5 for dierent
values of t and g2. in all those curves, we have considered values q  (2t )1, so that
we can neglect the  dependence and thus (4.10) becomes just the ratio f+(q)/f++(q).
we also recall that the f++ function can take negative values for smaller q, but we have
only displayed in figure 5 the region where r(t, g; q) is positive.

let us dene the parameter q0 to be the mean inter-particle distance so that q0 =
1/f+, i.e. the inverse of the density of charges, regardless of whether they are positive or
negative. thus,

q0(, t ) =

2t

m   

with m    in (4.5).
as in our previous analysis of the pressure and the fermion condensate, the relevant
parameter here is z in (3.8). for very small z the system is in the condensed regime.
since we need to work at large g2/ for dr to work, small z means large t . in that
regime, the + correlator is much larger than the ++ one at short distances (but yet
large distances compared to (2t )1), as a result of the tendency of the system to form
+ pairs (molecules). for large distances, r tends to 1.
in the normal phase,
i.e, when no molecules are formed, we expect that r starts approaching its asymptotic
value near q = q0 and it does not grow very much below q0. conversely in the molecule

18

phase, r grows for small q and it approaches 1 much faster, dening a certain qcond  q0,
which we interpret as the screening length or molecule size. for the curves plotted in
fig.5, we get i) qcond  1.3q0, ii) qcond  0.3q0, iii) qcond  0.01q0, iv) qcond  0.0025q0.
one can clearly observe that the screening length decreases with the temperature.

5 dimensional reduction of the thirring model at

nonzero fermion chemical potential

in [3], the issue of thermal bosonisation in the mt/sg system was also studied for  6= 0,
where  is the fermion chemical potential associated with the conservation of the fermion
number density 0 in the thirring model (the conserved quantity is the number of
fermions minus antifermions). it has been shown that the sg model lagrangian acquires
an extra topological term, interpreted as  times the number of kinks minus antikinks.
the purpose of this section is to show that in the dr regime, the partition function of
the thirring model at t > 0 and  6= 0 can also be related with the 1d coulomb gas.
partition function of the mt model at t > 0 and  6= 0:

we start by recalling the result (in perturbation theory in m) obtained in [3] for the

zm t (t, ; l) = zm=0(t, ; l)zc(t, ; l)

where zm=0(t, ; l) is the massless thirring result derived in [5] and is given by

and, as in (2.2), j = +1 for j  n, j = 1 for n < j  2n. notice that the above
partition function is real, as it should, because of the symmetry of the integrand under
the simultaneous relabelling q1  qn+1, . . ., qn  q2n.
once more, we need to analyse the regime in which we can dimensionally reduce the
it turns out that the analysis in
q variables inside the above integral through (2.4).
this case is much simpler than in the case of the two-point correlators and indeed the
conclusion is that dr works in the same regime as for the  = 0 pressure, that is, (2.13).
we quickly sketch the argument here: rst, for small  one readily notes that the leading

order is -independent since pj j = 0. second, for large t , one arrives to an expression

identical to (2.7), with f2() in (2.8) replaced now by

2

19

given therefore that one can work in dr also for  6= 0, the qs in (5.2) may be
replaced by (2.4). we then realise that zc(t, ) in (5.1) is now the grand canonical
classical partition function of the coulomb gas, the extra -dependent term having exactly
the form of a purely imaginary external electric eld term added to the hamiltonian of
the system.
in fact, note that if we wanted to describe (n positive and n negative)
charges on the line not only interacting among themselves with a coulomb force, but
also with an external electric eld e, we should add to the coulomb hamiltonian the
term

now let z0(, ) be the smallest positive solution to the equation

q(z, , ) =

q(z0(, ), , ) = 1.

(5.6)

then (z) is dened implicitly by identifying z2 = z0(, ).

first note that for  = 0 the above result reduces to the solution in terms of mathieu
functions we have found in section 3. in that case equation (5.6) denes precisely the
condition that the two parameters z and  of mathieus dierential equation (3.3) should

instance by means of a moving piston) rather than the grand canonical ensemble at xed z and l being
used herethe former are the conjugate variables of the latter. however, in the thermodynamic limit
the results obtained in the dierent ensembles should be equivalent, after the standard identications.
namely, for n  , l   with n/l xed, we can identify n with n and l with l, where the bar
denotes averages in the corresponding ensemble.

in [16] it was shown that equation (5.6) has always a solution.

satisfy in order that the solution is 2 periodic. therefore for  = 0, we have just
 = 0.
it is worth
mentioning that in our case, due to the purely imaginary character of , the convergence
of the dierent integrals analysed in [16] and hence of the continued fraction (5.5) is
automatically ensured. this should be contrasted with the real  case where  and 
have to satisfy certain constraints to ensure convergence. in addition, notice that for 
real, q in (5.5) is also real, which means that the pressure is real, as it should.

equation (5.6) can be solved exactly in the asymptotic limit z  1 and   1, where
we know there is condensation into molecules. for z,   1, q(z, , ) in (5.5) just
becomes

one can check that for  = 0 the above result reduces to the one we have found in
section 3 in that regime. notice that the pressure not only vanishes for large t (t  m)
but also for large  at large t (  t  m). that is, chiral restoration also takes place
for large  (in the large t limit here). this is conrmed by dierentiating the above with
respect to m to get the fermion condensate, which clearly vanishes as   . on the
other hand, dierentiating the pressure with respect to  yields the net averaged fermion
density,

(5.8)

where the rst contribution is the massless result obtained in [5]. the above result for the
fermion density deserves some comments. one notes that in (5.8) the coulomb correction
to the massless case is always negative and very small in this regime, since the above
result is valid only when t  m. therefore as t  , only the massless contribution
remains since the rst term is t -independent. this is nothing but another signal of chiral
restoration for large t : in that regime there remain only massless fermion excitations in
the thermal bath. the same is true if we take in (5.8) the limit   t as commented
above. in our picture of chiral condensation, the coulomb term in (5.8) represents the
density of residual charges that are not yet paired to form chiral molecules.

for arbitrary values of z, the solution to (5.6) has to be found numerically. first, one
truncates the continued fraction (5.5) to a given order, making sure that the dierence
between successive truncations becomes smaller than a xed numerical precision (see [22]
for details). this procedure is meaningful only if the continued fraction is convergent
and indeed, by computing it in this way we check numerically the arguments about

21

figure 6: the total net fermion density () (above the  axis) and the coulomb gas
correction c() to the massless gas (below the axis) for g2/ = 9 and dierent values
of the temperature around t = m. the massless result m=0() = /( + g2) is also
displayed for g2/ = 9.

convergence discussed above. then one has to nd, also numerically, the smallest positive
zero of q(z0, , ) = 1. for that purpose we have used a bisection method. in fact, since
our objective is to get the function (z), it is simpler to look for the zeroes in  xing
z0 = z2. besides, we have made use of the asymptotic expression (5.7) to check the
answer in the large z limit.

our results for c() and () are displayed in gure 6 for temperatures around
t  m at xed g2/ = 9 (2/4 = 0.1). when z increases, or equivalently when the
temperature decreases, c() (the curves below the axis in gure 6) has a similar shape as
that given by the second term in (5.8), but its magnitude increases so that the (negative)
correction to the massless gas becomes more and more important. in fact, we see that

for <m, c() roughly equals the massless contribution, thus yielding ()  0 in that

region, whereas for large , c() becomes negligible and only the massless contribution
remains.

in view of this behaviour, let us dene two critical points: 0  m such that
(<0)  0, ( > 0) 6= 0, and 1 such that ( > 1)  m=0(), where the curve
for () catches up with the massless one, i.e. 1 is the chiral restoration point. recall
that we have no true critical behaviour here, so that 0 and 1 can be dened only
approximately.

physically, 0 at t = 0 would represent the energy needed to excite a fermion in the
thermal bath. thus the behaviour of () in gure 6 near  = 0 is typical of a massive
fermi gas: it is approximately zero until   0. for instance, notice that for a free
gas of fermions of mass m, 0(t = 0) = m and (, t = 0) = (  m)(  m). for a
small but nonzero temperature, that characteristic step-function behaviour is smoothed

22

because there is also thermal energy available, and this can also be observed in gure 6
as t increases. remember that t  m is the lower temperatures we can take in our dr
regimesee our previous comments about the problems with the t  0+ limit within
our approach. in addition, notice that in our case, the almost exact cancellation between
c(<0) and m=0(<0) for low t takes place after a nontrivial numerical calculation

of the coulomb part, and therefore it provides a good consistency check.

let us now comment about the behaviour we observe for  > 1 in gure 6. fol-
lowing our previous description of chiral symmetry restoration in terms of pairing of
condensates, our results suggest that the chemical potential also increases the eective
coupling charge holding the condensate pairs together. in fact, from the viewpoint of
the coulomb gas, we now have another way of increasing the mean potential energy with
respect to the mean kinetic energy; namely to switch on a strong electric eld |e|  t .
it seems natural then that in this regime the systems behaves as in the low temperature
phase of lenard, forming molecules. this corresponds to the  > 1 regime in gure
6, i.e. moderate temperatures t  m and large chemical potentials   t .
as t increases further, the eective mass of the fundamental fermion decreases with
t , until, for very large t , the chiral symmetry is eectively restored and then () grows
linearly with   > 0 as given by (5.8).
this type of behaviour also takes place in qcd at nite baryon density b [24]. there,
at t = 0 one has 0  mb  930 mev, the vacuum to nuclear matter transition point,
with b(+
0 )  0.16 fm3 the density of nuclear matter, and at 1  1300 mev (for
t = 0) the chiral symmetry is restored (vanishing quark condensate). at both points it
is expected that the phase transition is of rst order at t = 0.

another system where one observes a similar behaviour of () is the massive schwinger
model [25], where for large  the system is in the deconned phase, unlike the massless
case, where there is connement for any  [5].

6 conclusions

in this paper we have considered the massive thirring model in 1+1 space-time dimen-
sions at nite temperature t and chemical potential . we have shown that in a certain
regime, which we have denoted dimensional reduction, the statistical mechanics of this
system is the same as that of a classical coulomb gas in one spatial dimension, where the
unit charge grows linearly with the temperature.

the range of validity of the dr regime depends on the observable under consideration:
for the pressure, the fermion density and the fermion condensate, we have seen that it

works both for t  m with g2 > 0 and for t >m with g2/  1 (strong coupling regime).
however, for the two-point correlators of fermion chiral operators (x), it only works for
large g, requiring in addition that the spatial distance q between the two chiral operators
is such that q  /2.
thanks to the analogy with the coulomb gas, we have been able to calculate exactly
the pressure, fermion density, fermion condensate and two-point correlators of the mt
model. our results show that the chiral symmetry is restored both for high t and high
 in a continuous way (no phase transition). chiral symmetry restoration takes place
only in the strong coupling (large g2) regime. the symmetry restored phase corresponds
to the coulomb condensed phase, in which + pairs of charges tend to pair, form-
ing molecules, whereas our low t phase is the coulomb plasma phase, in which the
charges are free. the low t and high t behaviours are reversed in our case with respect to

23

the coulomb gas because the coupling between charges grows with t . we have also seen
that the role of the coulomb charges is played here by the (x) operators. these oper-
ators tend to pair in the high t or  phase forming chiral invariant + combinations.
these play the role of the molecules, whose size is determined by the condensation
or screening length, which we have estimated for dierent values of the coupling constant
and temperature. we nd that the screening length decreases with t . in the restored
phase, this screening length is of the same order of the inter-particle distance, which is
proportional to the inverse of the fermion condensate.

the case of a nonzero fermion chemical potential  can also be related to the 1d
coulomb gas, by noting that  plays the role of a purely imaginary external electric
eld. for high t , the system behaves with  as the massless case, which is consistent
again with chiral restoration since the eective mass falls o with t . for t  m, we
see that the fermion density is very small until 0  m and then starts growing (typical
massive fermi gas behaviour) until eventually, for large  ( > 1), it reaches again the
massless linear behaviour (chiral restoration). this is again consistent with the idea that
the fermion excitation of the system becomes massless both at high t and at high . in
the case of moderate temperatures, chiral condensates are held together at large  by
means of the strong external electric eld.

among the analogies with qcd we have found, it is worth mentioning that the chiral
condensate vanishes for both large t and , although in our case there is no phase
transition. in addition, the type of behaviour of the fermion density () we have obtained
at low temperatures is also quite similar to that of the baryon number density b in qcd,
where 0 and 1 are the vacuum to nuclear matter and chiral restoration critical points,
respectively.

a dimensional reduction for the two-point correla-

tors

in order to compare the  correlators (4.8)-(4.9) with the corresponding f f ones ((4.6)-
(4.7)) in the coulomb gas, the former must be dimensionally reduced through (2.4) just
as in the case of the partition function. all calculations are performed with respect to
2.

let us start with the + correlator. the relevant integral to analyse now is:

where x  (q,  ), 0  q  l and we have set y = 0. the above integral is the
counterpart of (2.2). let us consider rst the limit 2/4  1. we readily realise
that the x-dependent factor in the integrand does not contribute to leading order, since

24

p j = 0. thus, following similar steps as in section 2.2, we get
 tc+(x)(0)    tc+(x)(0) asym

 tc+(x)(0) 

=

4!2
 i() + o  2

where i() is given in (2.9) and the superscript asym means now replacing the qs inside
the integrals as (2.4), but not for the function q2(x) outside, which would be allowed
only for q  /2 (see our comments in the main text). notice once more, that one
should be careful when taking t to arbitrary small values at the same time as expanding
in . here, we even nd a term m2/t 2 to leading order. again, we will consider our
approach valid only for t >m.

our numerical analysis of i() shows that it vanishes much faster than 1 as   ,
so that we see that for small , dr (for the integrals) is justied. notice that the above
relative error is scale independent, so we have xed  = m. that is not true for the
correlator (4.8) itself, where there is an explicit 22/2 overall dependence.

next, we will discuss the t  m case. following the same steps as for the partition

function, we get now

keeping the scale dependence outside the curly brackets.

thus, for t  m, we have to analyse the behaviour of the integral (a.2) with  and x
or, rather, the dierence between f +2
(, x) obtained by replacing the
qs by their asymptotic values. notice that f +2
(, 0) gives exactly the same contribution
as the partition function evaluated to the same order, that is, f +2
(, 0) = f2() in
(2.8). in fact, in the language of feynman diagrams, this is a disconnected contribution,
proportional to , so that the factor z0/zm t in front ensures that the answer for this
correlator is nite as    and we take it into account by subtracting the x = 0
contribution to the correlators. the same is true for f +,asym
(, x). bearing this in
mind, let us concentrate on the values of 2 close to and below 4. the reason is twofold:
on the one hand, we have seen already that for small  the dr works. on the other
hand, those are the values that will give us the biggest contributions to the error, since
the integrand of the asymptotic form is not singular at any point, whereas in (a.2), there
are singular regions where the denominator vanish, and those give larger (but nite)

2

contributions to the integral the closer we approach to 2<4. the direct numerical
evaluation of (a.2) is a hard task. however, for t  m, all we need to show is that the
dierence with its asymptotic value remains bounded close to 2<4. therefore, let us
estimate it by looking only at the biggest contributions, i.e, those of the regions close
to the singularities of the integrand. firstly, in the region x1  x2, where x1 = (q1, 1)

25

and x2 = (q2, 2), we see that the integrand simply tends to its x = 0 value, and hence
that contribution cancels with the partition function. on the other hand, near x2  x
or x1  0, the integrand goes like [q2(x)/q2(x2  x)q2(x)]2/4. then,

we have seen in section 2.1 that |f2()  22/2/22|<1 for 2 < 4.

as for the asymptotic contribution to the integral (a.2), we can evaluate it explicitly
by integrating over the four separate regions on the (q1, q2) plane according to the dierent
relative signs of q1  q2, q1  q and q2  q. we obtain in the    limit

therefore, from (a.4), (a.3) and (a.1), we see that the relative error for the two-point +

for 2 close to 4, unlike the pressure, but it grows arbitrarily large for q  1.

in the thermodynamic limit   , it is easy to check that i(, x)  i() because of
translation invariance, and that g(z)/f (z)  z/2, so that the relative error for small 
tends to zero (for t >m). again, asym means the same as for the + correlator, i.e,
replacing the qs by their asymptotic values only inside the integrals, but not for the
[q2(q,  )]2/4 factor in (a.5).

notice that there is an important dierence between this correlator and the previous
cases we have analysed, namely, that the dierence between the actual value and the
asymptotic limit shows up already to leading order in the m/t expansion, which is now
o(m/t )42/2 rather than o(1). that means that the relative error for the correlator
f ++
(, x) starts now at o(1), and therefore is not bounded. to check that this is indeed
2
the case, it is enough to take the dominant contribution to the integral by picking up the
dierent poles, as we did before with the + correlator. one easily nds now

(dominant contribution)

notice that in this correlator there is no disconnected contribution, which is consistent
with the fact that its large t expansion begins at nlo whereas that of the partition
function starts at o(1). in other words, f ++
(, x) is nite as   . on the other
hand, the asymptotic contribution yields

therefore, one readily checks that the relative error for f ++
(, x) is indeed o(1) for
arbitrary q, so that we cannot bound it in the t  m limit.
summarising, the structure of the correlators (4.8)-(4.9) makes it possible to reduce
them dimensionally in the small  limit but not in the large t one. as commented above,
dr will also work for the factors q2(x) outside the integral in the limit q  /2.
