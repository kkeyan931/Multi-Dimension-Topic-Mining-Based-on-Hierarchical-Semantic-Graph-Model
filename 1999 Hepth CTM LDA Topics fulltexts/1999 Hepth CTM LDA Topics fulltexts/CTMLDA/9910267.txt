(3.14) see one simply realize gf (r) expansion positive powers singular (in ) contributions r contribute b0. straightforward show contribution given (3.14). see, therefore, eective action boundary metric structure determined large extent action weyl transformations turn xed pbh transformation. specic form bulk action manifests set constants: b0 universal structure given (3.13) coecients terms involving weyl tensors (3.8) (3.10). remark general expressions (3.10), based symmetry considerations, dont assume action gives equation motion determines gij(x, ) action determines b same, provided dieoinvariant. explicit expression (3.13) b0 needs course identity two actions. next section exploit relation eective action trace anomalies order constrain ambiguities one hand extract universal properties trace anomalies eective action, other. 4. trace anomalies eective action start section brief summary general structure trace anomalies, c.f. ,{$9905111$},{$9905111$}, appearance trace anomalies boundary actions {$9806087$}. trace anomalies characterized anomalous weyl variation dieoin- variant eective action depending metric = 2n dimensions. action reects properties conformally invariant matter theory obtained, principle, coupling matter classical background metric integrating matter elds out. general eective action nonlocal functional metric. weyl variation, however, representing anomaly necessarily local. second variation action, i.e. rst variation anomaly, symmetric functional two innitesimal 7 weyl parameters. integrability condition wess -zumino condition anomaly must satisfy. stated structure oers general classication trace anomalies even dimension : a) always type anomaly whose expression euler characteristic respective dimension. type doesnt reect real logarithmic ultraviolet divergence. dimensional regularization however, term eective action giving rise it, piece simple pole 2n multiplying euler characteristic, separated, giving clear signature type anomaly. b) increasing (with dimension) number type b anomalies: originate true logarithmic divergences correlators lower order anomalous ones. signature expression exactly weyl invariant. simplest way construct weyl invariant expressions contraction weyl tensors invariants starting covariant derivatives weyl tensors, etc. dimensional regularization, terms appear directly eective action multiplying poles 2n d. addition cohomologically trivial local expressions, i.e. obtained weyl variations local, weyl non-invariant, pieces eective action. terms, repre- senting arbitrary real parts (subtraction constants) underlying matter theory, cannot contain dynamical information explicit form depends regularization chosen. going back (3.7) observe bn appears multiplying pole 2nd: therefore bn trace anomaly = 2n dimensions, i.e. could expanded linear combination type a, type b appropriate dimension cohomologically trivial terms. indeed, mentioned previous section, bns satisfy wz condition, eq.(3.5). rst conclusion could reach eq.(3.8) always solution terms local expressions linear combinations type a, type b cohomologically trivial. course puts constraints terms could appear r.h.s. (3.8). interested, however, way could extract universal information trace anomalies eective action. anomaly type clear candidate type information. indeed, remarked before, terms involving contractions weyl tensors (i.e. type b) appear arbitrary coecients bn; therefore couldnt expect simple, general expression type b. 8 order isolate general expression looking type a, use following simple observation: exactly weyl invariant expression vanishes identically metric conformally at, i.e. form: g(0)ij = exp(2)ij . (4.1) therefore terms arbitrary coecients various recursion relations (the homogeneous terms) disappear. consequence, unambiguous solution equations metric form (4.1) give us information surviving type anomaly. expand solutions powers dened (4.1). particular euler characteristic = 2n starts n-th power : e2n 1 2n ri1j1k1l1 . . . rinjnknln i1j1...injn k1l1...knln = n! 2n (i1 j1 ) (in jn )i1...in j1...jn + o(n+1) . (4.2) now, main problem isolate contribution type anomaly (proportional euler characteristic) cohomologically trivial pieces. rewrite basic recursive relation (3.8) integrated form multiplying innitesimal weyl parameter 1 variation new weyl parameter 2: z ddxqg(0)(x) 12bn = 2nz ddxqg(0)(x) 12bn z ddxqg(0)(x)i1 n1 xm=0 bmai (nm) , (4.3) ai contains 2. metric form (4.1) expanding powers easy see bn starts term containing n powers ai starts terms follows: ai (1) = l2 2 ai (2) = l6 ai (3) = 8 + o() , l4 (ij)j + o(2) , 4 (ik)(kj)j + o(3) . (4.4) using induction straightforward prove (4.4) generalizes expected, i.e. term order n form: ai (n) = ()n+1 l2n 2n ij j + o(n) . (4.5) 9 now, expansion bn cohomologically trivial pieces come weyl variation local expression containing n+1 powers . variation replaces eld turn 1. consequence result symmetric interchange 1. euler characteristic multiplied 1 doesnt share symmetry property. therefore, antisymmetrize eq.(4.3), i.e. equation multiplied n subtract n terms 1 interchanged factor 2 respectively, left l.h.s. contribution euler term only. 3 specialize even pick one particular term euler character- istic e.g. contribution n!2n( )n. term give contribution 1 2( )n1 integrand l.h.s. (4.3), antisymmetrized course, numerical coecient following normalizations. try match term terms r.h.s. (4.3). explicit form ai see terms r.h.s. except last, (n 1) th one sum, . last term however, two partial derivatives contracted partial integration contribution integrand form: 1 2bn1 antisymmetrized. antisymmetrization projects bn1 contributions euler one (n1)th order . particular ( )n1 contribution e2(n1) matches nicely l.h.s. obtained, therefore recursion relation euler contributions alone, dierent orders. reintroducing numerical factors left previous argument recursion easily solved obtain euler contribution general formula: bn = l2nb0 22n(n!)2 e2n+cohomologically trivial terms . (4.6) using expression (3.13) b0 evaluated = 2n general formula type trace anomaly even dimension corresponding given gravity action admits ads solution. think gravity action given abstractly polynomial curvature without specifying dimension. specic form action enters determining radius ads solution evaluation action solution, give b0. factors depending dimension = 2n expression coecient type anomaly explicit. remarked already previous section symmetry considerations require action determines g one determines b same. universal dependence dimension appears, however, two actions identied. 3 term 1 interchanged 2 automatically cancels original term, content wz condition; could left changed normalization n 1 10 5. discussion pbh argument weyl transformations eective boundary theory understood follow dieomorphisms bulk theory. dependence odd variable bulk gets translated dependence dimension, b(x, ) playing role generating function type trace anomalies various dimensions. nal result similar spirit elliptic genus gives, descent equations, unifying expression chiral anomaly various dimensions. elliptic genus gives expression chiral anomaly gauge theories chiral fermions various dimensions gauge group representation con- tent fermions. analogy is, however, part really dont understand, i.e. common feature conformal eld theories various dimensions whose trace anomalies represented gravitational action. tempting conjecture general properties like e.g. ow measured anomaly coecient, common theories. would suggest type anomaly coecient = 4 related c = 2 gives right generalization c-theorem rst proposed cardy {$9905111$}. beginning b3 euler characteristic appears accompanied cohomologically trivial terms determined recursion relations. dont understand physical signicance, any, terms. generally, would interesting study exact mathematical structure cohomological equations (2.8), (2.9) (3.9). finally, special role type anomaly plays discussion suggests singled understanding non-leading 1/n corrections ads/cft correspondence still control {$9905111$}. postpone discussion problem later publication. 11
