massive symmetric tensor eld on ads

abstract

the two-point green function of a local operator in cft corresponding to a massive
symmetric tensor eld on the ads background is computed in the framework of the
ads/cf t correspondence. the obtained two-point function is shown to coincide with
the two-point function of the graviton in the limit when the mass vanishes.

1 introduction

the ads/cf t correspondence conjectured in [1] stated that in the large n limit and at large
t hooft coupling  = g2
y m n the classical supergravity/m-theory on the anti-de sitter space
(ads) times a compact manifold is dual to a certain su(n) conformal gauge theory (cf t )
dened on the boundary of ads. one notable example of this correspondence being the duality
between d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory and d = 10 type iib supergravity
theory on ads5  s5. the precise formulation of the conjecture was given in [2], [3] where
it was proposed to identify the generating functional for connected green functions of local
operators in cft with the on-shell value of the supergravity action under the restriction that
the supergravity elds satisfy the dirichlet conditions on the boundary of ads. recall that in
the standard representation of ads as an upper-half space x0 > 0, xk  r, k = 1, . . . d with
the metric

ds2 = gdxdx =

1
x2

0 (cid:16)dx0dx0 + ijdxidxj(cid:17) ,

where ij could be either minkowksi or euclidean, the boundary includes the plane x0 = 0 as
well as the point x0 = . since the boundary is located innitely far away from any point
in the interior the supergravity action is infrared divergent and must be regularized. as was
pointed out in [4] the consistent regularization procedure (with respect to ward identities)
requires one to shift the boundary of ads to the surface in the interior dened by x0 = . then
the dirichlet boundary value problem for supergravity elds is properly dened and one can
compute the on shell value of the supergravity action as a functional of the boundary elds.

with the account of this regularization procedure the standard formulation of the ads/cf t
correspondence assumes the form:

ho(x1)  o(xn)i = lim

0



1(x1)   



n(xn)

sonshell (1(x1), . . . , n(xn))|i(xi)=i(x0=,xi),

where xi are some points on the boundary of adsd+1, oi(xi) are gauge invariant composite
operators in cf t and i(xi) are the corresponding supergravity elds. here we used the
convention in which the coordinates x of adsd+1 are split according to: x = (x0, x), so that
x  rd. the action sonshell is the sum of the bulk supergravity action and the boundary terms
necessary to make the ads/cf t correspondence complete. the origin of these boundary terms
was elucidated in [5] where it was shown that they appear in passing from the hamiltonian
description of the bulk action to the lagrangian one.

the ads/cf t correspondence has been tested by computing various two- and three-point
functions of local operators in d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory on ads5. in
particular two-point functions corresponding to scalars [3] - [8], vectors [3], [4], [9], [10] spinors
[10] - [12], rarita-schwinger elds [13] - [16], antisymmetric form elds [17] - [20] and gravitons
[5], [21], [22] were computed on the ads background. the only eld in the supergravity
spectrum [23] that has evaded the attention is the massive symmetric second-rank tensor eld
dened by the action found in [24] for the case of ads5 and its natural generalization for
adsd+1. in this paper we ll in the gap by computing the remaining two-point green function.
we note that the dirichlet boundary value problem for the massive symmetric tensor eld
is nontrivial due to the fact that the equations of motion for various components are coupled
which presents a serious obstacle. furthermore, in computing the two-point green function we
have to stick with the regularization procedure described above in order to obtain the consistent
result. at the end of our computation we nd that in the limit when the mass vanishes the
correlation function reduces to that of the massless symmetric tensor eld, i.e. the graviton.

2 equations of motion

the starting point in the calculation is the action for the symmetric traceless second-rank tensor
ab on adsd+1 which is a generalization of the action derived in [24]:

(2.1)
where g is the determinant of the ads metric g. let us note that this action already contains
the appropriate boundary terms and so can be readily used for computing the two-point green
function. the action (2.1) leads to the following equations of motion

  

  

 + (2  m2) = 0,

(2.2)

where  is the levi-civita connection computed on the ads background. the massive term in
(2.2) destroys the standard symmetry  =  +  which is present in the case of the
massless symmetric tensor eld [5]. as a result of this symmetry breaking one can no longer

impose a gauge condition on 
the equations of motion by using the constraint:

 . since 

 is traceless, we can eliminate the component 0

0 from

0 = i
i.
in what follows it is convenient to introduce a concise notation:

some comments are in order. equations (i), (iii) and (v) are simply (ij), (0i) and (00)
components of (2.2), respectively; equations (ii) and (iv) are obtained from (i) and (iii),
respectively, by dierentiating with respect to xi and (vi) is the trace of (i). to simplify the
notation, we chose the convention in which indices i, j = 1, . . . , d are raised and lowered with
the at metric ij so that, in particular,  = ijij. also for deniteness we will assume
that the at metric ij is euclidean: ij  ij. obviously the obtained results can be easily
extended to the case when ij is minkowski.

we remind that in the case of the graviton it proved convenient to decompose the tensor
eld into the transversal and the longitudinal components [5]. encouraged by this example, we
likewise introduce the transversal part of i
j:

here we used (iii) in order to express 0kk

to eliminate the unphysical eld i appearing in the rst term in square brackets. to achieve
this we need to nd an additional equation that would allow us to express the unphysical eld
mentioned above in terms of various components of i
j and that would be simple enough to be
substituted back into eq.(2.6). to this end, we take advantage of (iii) to get rid of 0kk

the left hand side (lhs) of (ii) to obtain:

here k is the modied bessel function [25]:

(2.13)

from denition (2.11) it follows that to obtain the transversal part of i

the trace  of i
rst concentrate on the eld . to this end, we subtract (v) from (vi) to get:

j as well as the contraction of l

now we note that the right hand side (rhs) of this equation coincides with rhs of (iv) and
by taking advantage of this one arrives at a simple relation between the eld  and :

(2.15)

with the same value for  as in (2.12). now we show how to determine c(, k). first, we

where once again recurrence formulae (2.13) were used.

next we consider the eld i. the experience that we have obtained suggests that we

introduce the transversal part of i:

let us rst consider the contribution to sonshell that depends locally on boundary elds, i.e.
does not contain the normal derivative 0. we expect that such terms do not contribute to the
non-local part of sonshell. thus we need to consider the behavior of  and k on the boundary
of ads. to this end we note that according to (2.17) and with the account of (2.29) the eld
(k) is local while i(k) is equal to:

i(k) = (i)hg

 (k)kll

i(k) (cid:16)g

 (k) + gk

(k)(cid:17) kiklkm
k2 l

(3.2)

m(k)i.
 (k) + gk

taking into account (2.30) and (2.31) we nd that in the limit   0, (g
(k))
is o(k)2 so that i(k) is also a local eld. consequently, the terms that depend locally on
boundary elds do not contribute to the non-local part of sonshell as we have expected.

next we consider terms with the normal derivative 0. in evaluating such terms it is useful

to employ the following identity

d

dx0  (cid:18)x0

f (k) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x0=
 (cid:19)n f (x0k)

ln f (k).

(3.3)

from this identity it follows that we need to know the power series expansion of the logarithmic
derivative of each function that enters into (2.27). these expansions are:

thus, 0 is a local expression and therefore does not contribute to the non-local part of
sonshell. consequently, the non-local part is entirely determined by the following expression

where s is the non-local part of sonshell. taking into account solution (2.27) for the eld
j and expansions (3.4) - (3.6) we see that the expression for 0i
i
j gets three dierent con-
tributions: the rst contribution comes from dierentiating the ratio x0
 raised to the power
2 + 2  (cid:17); the second contribution comes from o(k2) terms in the power ex-
2  (cid:17) or (cid:16) d
(cid:16) d

pansion of the logarithmic derivative of various functions in (2.27) and the third contribution
comes from o(21k2) terms in the same expansion. from (2.27) we can easily read o the
rst contribution which is equal to

in the process of deriving (3.10) we dropped all terms containing i
negligible in the limit   0. to understand why this is so, note that when i

j since such terms are
j is contracted
j(x) which according to (2.17) is order o(2)

in order to complete the calculation of the two-point green function we need to evaluate
the integral over k in (3.11). to this end, we employ the standard formula for the fourier

equal to:
