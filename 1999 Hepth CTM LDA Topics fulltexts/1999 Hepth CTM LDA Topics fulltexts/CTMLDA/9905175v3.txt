we consider the theory obtained by adding to the usual string frame dilaton gravity action specially
constructed higher derivative terms motivated by the limited curvature construction of [1] and
determine the spatially homogeneous and isotropic solutions to the resulting equations of motion. all
solutions of the resulting theory of gravity with these symmetries are nonsingular and all curvature
invariants are bounded. for initial conditions inspired by the pre-big-bang scenario solutions exist
which correspond to a spatially at universe starting in a dilaton-dominated superinationary phase
with h > 0 and having a smooth transition to an expanding friedmann universe with h < 0. hence,
the graceful exit problem of pre-big-bang cosmology is solved in a natural way.

i. introduction

one of the paramount problems manifest in modern
cosmological theories is that of the initial singularity.
gasperini and veneziano have proposed the pre-big-bang
(pbb) model [2] based on the assumption that the uni-
verse evolved out of a ten-dimensional minkowski space-
time which is an exact vacuum of string theory, in hopes
of resolving the singularity problem. recently, branden-
berger, easther and maia [3] managed to construct non-
singular cosmological solutions based on initial conditions
resembling those of the pre-big-bang scenario. they be-
gan with dilaton gravity and the low energy eective ac-
tion of string theory in the einstein frame, adding to
it specially constructed higher derivative terms. as the
string frame is the fundamental frame with respect to
string theory [4], it is important to reconsider the analy-
sis of [3], performing the calculations directly in the string
frame. the einstein frame metric g is related to the
string frame metric g via a conformal transformation
[5]

g = eg ,

(1)

where  is the dilaton.

the (pbb) model is constructed from the low energy
eective action of string theory. in the string frame, after
compactication to four dimensions, the action is given
by [6]

s = 

1

22 z d4xg e(cid:8)r + ()2 + (cid:9) ,

(2)

where 2 = 8g = 8m2
pl .

the pbb model gives us hope of nding a nonsingu-
lar cosmology in which in the einstein frame the uni-
verse starts out in a cold dilaton-dominated contracting
phase, goes through a bounce and then emerges as an

expanding frw universe. in the string frame this cor-
responds to [7] a universe starting in a superinationary
phase with h > 0 and emerging as a usual frw universe
with h < 0.

as is well known, it is impossible to smoothly con-
nect the contracting and expanding branches of the pbb
model using only the tree-level action [811]. these
branches are separated by a future and past singularity
of the branches respectively. however, one-loop eects
in superstring cosmology are capable of regulating the
singularities [12] and smoothly connecting a contracting
phase to an expanding phase in the presence of spatial
curvature. refs [1328] describe other attempts to regu-
late the singularities of pre-big-bang cosmology. most of
these approaches, however, have the drawback of being
perturbative in nature, and that their consequences are
only felt in the region of the theory which can only be
described by the full non-perturbative physics. we wish
to discuss a mechanism to solve the graceful exit problem
which involves non-perturbative physics. in the absence
of a non-perturbative denition of string theory we will
discuss a toy model which only contains gravity and the
dilaton.

it is natural to assume that any eective theory of grav-
ity obtained from string theory, quantum gravity, or by
integrating out matter elds, will contain higher deriva-
tive terms in the action. the question we wish to address
is if by adding specially chosen higher derivative terms
to the ricci scalar of the einstein action we are able to
cancel the divergences of classical gravity present at ex-
tremely large curvatures.

hence, our general approach will be to construct a
higher order theory of gravity admitting cosmological so-
lutions which are everywhere nonsingular and compatible
with the pbb scenario.

see http://www.to.infn.it/gasperin/ for an updated col-

lection of papers on pre-big-bang cosmology.

one such construction is carried out in refs [1,29].
the resulting action includes a particular combination of
quadratic invariants of the riemann tensor, similar to a
gauss-bonnett term added to the usual einstein-hilbert
action for gravity. the inclusion of this invariant causes
all solutions of the equations of motion to approach de
sitter space-time at high curvature, which is naturally
nonsingular. although in general most higher-derivative
theories of gravity have much worse singularity properties
than einstein gravity, this particular construction stems
from the limiting curvature hypothesis (which we will
discuss more below) and is entirely nonsingular.

the most elementary way to formulate a nonsingular
gravitational theory is to add an invariant i2 to the ac-
tion, with the property that i2 = 0 is true if and only if
the spacetime is de sitter. by coupling i2 into the grav-
itational action via a lagrange multiplier eld  with a
potential chosen to ensure that i2  0 at large curvatures
we can force all solutions to approach de sitter space in
this regime. for homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes,
a simple choice for i2 which satises the aforementioned
criteria [3] is

i2 = q4r r  r2 .

(3)

recall that the physically measurable curvature invari-
ants such as r and r r are constructed from the
string frame metric, g. the simplest desired action
including i2 is

s(g, ) = z d4xg e(r + i2  v ())

(4)

where v () is a function chosen such that the action has
the correct einsteinian low curvature limit for   0,
whereas for ||   the constraint equation forces i2 
0. after integrating out , we obtain a higher derivative
gravity theory which is nonpolynomial in the curvature.
note that introducing the lagrange multiplier eld 
is a convenient way of writing a non-polynomial higher
derivative gravity action in a polynomial form.  has
no independent physical meaning. by itself, it neither
represents a new matter eld, nor does it stand for a
particular symmetry. the situation is analogous to the

construction [1] of the action sr = r dt1  x2 for point
ing action sn r = r dt 1

particle motion in special relativity from the correspond-
2 x2 for point particle motion in
newtonian mechanics.
if the lagrange multiplier con-
struction analogous to the one employed in this paper is
used to construct the new theory, with a general poten-
tial satisfying the asymptotic conditions required, then
the resulting theory will have bounded velocity but will
not be the theory for point particle motion in the special
relativity, i.e. in the theory with the new symmetry. sr
can only be obtained by means of a very special choice
of the coecients of the potential for . in analogy, we
cannot expect to be able to extract any new stringy sym-
metry from the ad-hoc construction of this work.

in this paper, we will show that the addition of the
same higher derivative terms as used above in (4) to the
action of pbb cosmology results in the elimination of sin-
gularities and connects the (in the einstein frame) dila-
ton driven contracting phase with the expanding phase
via a bounce.

from the point of view of string theory our construc-
tion appears, unfortunately, rather articial in that we
are picking out a particular narrow class of (nonpolyno-
mial) higher derivative gravity actions from the innite
dimensional space of such actions. our work should be
viewed as an existence proof (in the string frame) of a
higher derivative dilaton gravity theory with nonsingular
cosmological solutions rather than as a realistic string-
motivated model.

in particular, the invariant i2 which plays a crucial role
in our construction is not one of the curvature invariants
which appears in the next to leading order in derivatives
of the low energy eective action of string theory. the
role of the invariant i2 and of the associated lagrange
multiplier eld is to implement the limiting curvature
hypothesis. there are indications that this hypothesis is
realized in nonperturbative string theory (see e.g. [30]),
as a consequence of t-duality. this duality is broken when
considering the low energy eective action of string the-
ory, and it is therefore not to be expected that the cur-
vature invariants which arise in this low energy eective
action can be used in place of i2. the invariant i2 plays
the role of non-perturbative information about the the-
ory. obviously, since the non-perturbative denition of
string theory is still unknown, we cannot hope that i2
yields more than a toy model for what string theory will
eventually tell us. since the limiting curvature hypothe-
sis plays an important role in both our construction and
in string theory, we can hope that our model may even-
tually turn out to contain some of the relevant physics.
we should also warn the reader that our work has noth-
ing to say concerning the initial condition problem [31] of
the pre-big-bang scenario.

ii. action and equations of motion

we begin with the string frame action for dilaton grav-
ity, adding to it the higher derivative term given by i2, in
analogy to what was done in the absence of the dilaton
in refs [1,29] and in the einstein frame in ref [3]:

s = 1

22 z d4xg e(cid:8)r + ()2 + cei2  v ()(cid:9).

(5)

for the moment, we allow a general coupling between i2
and the dilaton. minimal coupling corresponds to setting
the constant  equal to zero. the constant c rescales the
lagrange multiplier eld , and will be chosen to simplify
the equations of motion.

where d2 is the metric on s2 and n(t) is an arbitrary
lapse function which we will set to unity in the eom
below. the equations of motion resulting from varying
(5) with respect to ,  and n become

from the equation of motion for  in (8) (and considering
the region of small ) it follows that v () must become
negative, assuming that it is positive for small ||. let
b denote the value of  at the bounce. this will occur
when

v (b) = 2 ,

as can be seen from the equation of motion for  setting
h = 0.

note that the specic values of the coecients of the

respectively, where dots denote dierentiation with re-
spect to time, t.

for a spatially at, bouncing universe, we set the cur-
vature constant k = 0. we will simplify things further by
considering minimal coupling of  to i2, i.e.  = 0. to
eliminate useless constant coecients in the equations
of motion, it is convenient to choose c = 1/12. the
resulting equations of motion become

with  =  and the prime () denoting dierentiation

now let us focus on the construction of the potential
v (). once again, our arguments are the same as in ref
[3]. when the curvature is small, the terms in the action
(5) with lagrange multiplier eld  dependence must be
negligible compared to the usual terms of dilaton gravity.
this is made manifest by the condition

v ()  2

||  0

(9)

since the region of small || will correspond to the low
curvature regime. [29] in order to implement the limit-
ing curvature hypothesis, the invariant i2 must tend to
zero, and hence the metric g will approach a de sit-
ter metric at large curvatures, i.e.
for ||  . from
the variational equation with respect to , we nd the
requirement

v ()  const

||   .

(10)

as in [3] we add a third condition in order to ensure
that there is a bouncing solution for k = 0. the equa-
tions must allow a conguration with h = 0 and  6= 0.

iii. phase diagram of solutions

the condition (11) on the potential v () ensures that
our model is nonsingular and geodesically complete for
large values of || but says nothing about geodesic com-
pleteness of solutions which always remain within the
small || regime. hence it is necessary to study the small
|| region in order to prove that our model is everywhere
nonsingular.
in this section we discuss the projection of the three
dimensional phase space (, h, ) of our model into the
two dimensional phase plane (, h) for small values of .
by projecting out the  axis we lose no relevant informa-
tion about the system since the curvature invariants are
not aected by . both analytical and numerical meth-
ods are used to study the trajectories of solutions of (8)
in the phase plane and thus explicitly demonstrate the
absence of singularities. furthermore, and unlike in the
model of refs. [1,29], we shall show that our theory ad-
mits spatially at bouncing solutions as in the einstein
frame model of [3].

we need to demonstrate that all solutions tend to a
known nonsingular and geodesically complete space-time
at large positive and negative times. with the symme-
tries of our problem, these asymptotic space-times are
either minkowski or de sitter. we need to show that all
phase space trajectories either tend to the origin of phase
space or else to ||   for nite values of h. we will
rst analyze the phase space trajectories for small values
of ||. in section 4 we then discuss the case of large ||.
there are many interesting points and curves on the
phase plane (, h) which demand special attention.
first, the point (, h, ) = (0, 0, 0) corresponds to
minkowski space-time. the potential v () vanishes at
this point, but it also vanishes at the values

b = 4 .

(13)

from the rst equation in (8) it follows that the phase
plane points (b, 0, 0) correspond to bouncing points of
cosmological trajectories. the general equation for a pos-
sible bounce is

v () = 2 .

(14)

to prove that this is in fact a bounce, we need to show
that contracting solutions are attracted to it. this will
be done below.

h vanishes when the derivative of v does, i.e. at the

values

(15)

-0.1

trajectories which cross the phase space planes (d, h, )
have h = 0 at the points where they cross.

to show that the curves through (, h, ) = (4 
f (), 0, ), with f () chosen such that (2  v ) = 0,
represent bounce solutions, we expand the  equation of
motion near h = 0, which gives

h(  + 6  ) = 2  v .

(16)

first note that contracting solutions with |h|  1 and
2 <  < 4  f () have  > 0 and approach the bounce
(4 f (), 0, ) in nite time since h is positive and does
not go to zero. if the trajectories reach  > 4  f ()
before hitting the  axis, then  changes sign. this
shows that the bounce is an attractor on the contracting
branch. by taking the time derivative of the  equation
in (8) and using the other two equations to eliminate 
and h and after expanding near the bounce it can be
veried that on the expanding side of the branch  < 0
and that therefore the trajectories will eventually turn
around (i.e.

 < 0) (see figure 1).

by expanding the equations about the origin we nd

that

which denes the critical surface

(18)

note that lines on the critical surface are not phase space
trajectories of the equations of motion. such trajectories
would point in the vertical direction at the critical surface
since d/dh = 0. note also that as 2 increases, the
critical surface approaches the  axis.

for the contracting solutions we nd that the equation

of motion for h becomes

h  2 .

(19)

hence contracting solutions with  > 0 which are above
the critical surface have h < 0 and from eq. (17)  > 0.
these trajectories are pulled toward the  = 2 curve
where h changes sign. trajectories which start out in

the  = 2 surface at a value |h|  1 are good can-
didates for spatially at bouncing universes (see fig-
ure 1). the analysis of trajectories through (, h, ) =
(4 + f (), 0, ) is similar. trajectories near the origin
below the critical surface correspond to solution which
oscillate about minkowski space-time (see figure 1).

there is a separatrix surface in the lower right quad-
rangle of the phase plane which separates trajectories
which reach  = 2 from those which do not and which
eventually cross the critical line. the solutions for tra-
jectories above this separatrix line close to the origin can
be obtained by taking the time derivative of the second
equation in (8) and inserting the rst equation and by
considering terms which dominate near the origin. for
small values of 2 we obtain

h h = 6 hh +

h 2 ,

(20)

which is the same equation as the corresponding one in [3]
except for the rst term on the right hand side. however,
by inserting as an ansatz the solutions found in [3]

h(t) = ct2

(21)

where c is a constant, it is not hard to show that for small
values of t, the extra term in our equation gives negligible
corrections to these trajectories. for suciently small

values of c, the trajectories lead to bouncing solutions,
whereas for somewhat larger values of c, the trajectories
cross the  = 2 plane at |h| > 1.

however, as will be discussed in section 4,  is rapidly
growing, and eventually (unless the dilaton is stabilized),
the 2 term in the above equation takes over and leads to
 < 0, in which case these solutions also tend to de sitter
space, but at large negative values of . the bottom line
is that there are no singularities in the phase space region
 > 2 and h < 0.

from figure 2 we see a potentially troublesome fea-
ture of the phase space near  = 2. there are critical
lines with  = 0 which converge to  = 2 and h = 
from the left, and to  = 2 and h =  from the right.
along these critical lines, the trajectories appear to head
o to innity (for negative h) or emerge from innity
(for positive h), suggesting a singularity is present in
the model. upon a more detailed analysis of the eom
it becomes clear that the solutions in this region are re-
pelled by the critical line. to see this begin with the
critical line obtained by setting  = 0. considering the
lower right quadrant of the phase plane, to the left of the
critical line, we have

 =

6h 2 + 2  v
h(3h + 6  )

.

(23)

the critical line for small values of 2 approaches the
surface  = 2 from the right (note that in the einstein
frame model of [3] it approached from the left, the dif-
ference being due to the extra term in the  equation of
motion in (8)). dierentiating the  equation of motion
with respect to time and evaluating the result along the
critical line we see that

 < 0

(24)

and hence the critical line is a repeller, sending the tra-
jectories away from the line and toward the asymptotic
de sitter region. to the right of the critical line  > 0
and the trajectories are again pushed away from  = 2.
consider the example of a frozen dilaton,   0.

hence, for |h| >> || we nd

  (v  + 3h 2)(  2)

(25)

and  < 0 as expected. solutions to the left of the critical
line peel away to the de sitter region while those to the
right of the critical line approach from de sitter.

we also wish to show that |h|   if and only if

plane of phase space for larger values of |h|. the axes are
the same as in fig. 1. the only regions in phase space where
trajectories tend to |h| = , i.e. to curvature singularities,
are near the two critical lines which tend to  = 2. as shown
in the text, these lines repel trajectories, and hence there are
no singular trajectories even in these regions.

region the change in  with respect to h is given by

(26)

hence we see that the slope of the solutions increase and
begin to level o as |h| increases.
to conclude this section, we have shown at this point
that there are no singularities for small values of 2 and
that all solutions can be continued to arbitrary large
proper time, which demonstrates geodesic completeness.
in this following section we turn to the discussion of the
dynamics for large 2.

iv. dilaton evolution and

stabilization

the dilaton is the massless scalar eld with gravita-
tional strength couplings, found in all perturbative string
theories. it is generally believed that dynamical eects
will generate a mass for the dilaton in vacua with bro-
ken supersymmetry [6].
if the dilaton were to remain
massless [32] it would aect the values of gauge couplings,
and produce potentially observable consequences.

in our model there are singularities in . consider the

eom for  in the large 2 limit

 =

this has solution

(t) =

1(t0)  1

2 (t  t0)

,

which blows up when

(t0) =

2

(t  t0)

.

(27)

(28)

(29)

this singularity does not concern us however, since
it can be avoided by adding a simple potential u () to
the dilaton equation in order to freeze the dilaton in a
manner consistent with the above argument. where this
potential comes from is the usual problem of any theory
with a dilaton, a problem to which we have no answer
either.

what happens to the projection of the phase space
trajectories onto the   h plane in the large  regime?
here we have

 =  +

2
h

(30)

and the h equation of motion remains the same. imme-
diately we see that for h 6= 0, | |   which implies
that    and hence h  const. further insight is
gained by noticing that

 > 0
 < 0

for h > 0

for h < 0.

(31)

(32)

we know that v  vanishes for  = 0 and  = 2. thus
(33)

 = 2

 = 0 :

h

 = 2 :

 = 2 + 2
h .

(34)

therefore, solutions above h = 0 stretch straight (more
or less) across the   h plane from left to right, and
those below the h = 0 line stretch from right to left, as
can be seen in figure 3.

in the large 2 limit, the equation for the critical sur-

face  = 0 becomes

  

2
3h 2 .

(35)

however, since for any solution of the equations of motion
in this regime 2 grows much faster than , trajectories
h  0. this
do not reach the critical surface. instead,
completes the proof that there are no curvature singular-
ities for large 2, and that the solutions asymptotically
approach either minkowksi or de sitter.

finally, let us assume that the dilaton has been xed.
in this case,  = 0 and the remaining equations of mo-
tion become almost identical to the ones studied in [3]
(for  = 0) except for the 6 term on the right hand

and 2. due to the extra terms in the equations of motion, the

as discussed in the text, there are no singular trajectories
even in the vicinity of these critical lines.

side of the  equation of motion in (8). this term, how-
ever, is subdominant in the large |h| region, and hence
the conclusions of [3] concerning the absence of singulari-
ties carry over to our case. the extra term does, however,
lead to asymmetries in the phase portrait under reec-
tions about the  axis. there are now three critical lines
where  = 0. the rst line occurs for 0 <  < 2 for
positive values of h, and with h   as   . the
second line occurs for 2 <  <  and for negative val-
ues of h with h   as   2. finally, for  < 0
there is a harmless critical line which remains at small
negative values of h (see figure 3). as in section 3 it
can be shown that the two rst critical lines repel the
trajectories. hence, the proof of non-singularity of the
model carries over.

v. conclusions

we have extended the model of nonsingular dilaton
cosmology presented in [3] to the string frame. us-
ing the limiting curvature construction of [1,29] applied
to dilaton gravity formulated in the string frame, we
have obtained spatially at bouncing cosmological so-
lutions. the construction consists of adding specially
chosen higher derivative gravity terms in the form of a
curvature invariant i2 to the string frame action. the

invariant i2 is made up of invariants quadratic in the
riemann curvature and has the property that i2 = 0 sin-
gles out the maximally symmetric de sitter space-times
among all homogeneous and isotropic solutions. it is cou-
pled to dilaton gravity via a lagrange multiplier eld .
the  eld is nondynamical but has a potential v (),
which was chosen to allow non-singular bouncing solu-
tions.

the three dimensional phase space of trajectories was
studied both analytically and numerically to demonstrate
that all solutions are nonsingular. specically we studied
a large class of solutions which lead to bouncing cosmolo-
gies. the dynamics of the bounce are governed by the
higher derivative gravity terms introduced by the limit-
ing curvature construction.

the connection with pre-big-bang cosmology appears
in a dierent form than in the einstein frame.
in the
string frame picture of pre-big-bang cosmology, the uni-
verse starts in a superexponentially expanding dilaton-
dominated phase with h > 0 and h > 0, i.e.
in the
upper left quadrangle of the projected phase space of fig-
ures 2 and 3. in the absence of the higher derivate terms,
the trajectories would diverge to h = . however, as
is obvious from figures 2 and 3, the new terms we have
added lead to a graceful exit from this phase. the tra-
jectories cross the  = 0 axis and go over to trajectories
which are like the usual expanding frw solutions with
h > 0 and h < 0. this happens independent of whether
the dilaton is frozen at late times or not.

there is a singularity in the dilaton equation of motion
but it is assumed that this problem can be solved by the
introduction of a dilaton potential u (). although we
do not propose a specic form for this potential, such
a potential is physically necessary in all theories with a
dilaton in order to generate a mass for the dilaton.

the most obvious criticism of this model is that the
higher order terms in the action are articially con-
structed rather than derived from fundamental physics.
however it is important to recall that our method is well
motivated. for one, all eective theories of gravity, in-
cluding those produced by string theory, quantum grav-
ity, or from quantizing matter elds in curved spacetime
must contain higher derivative terms in the action. fur-
thermore, it is natural to assume that physical invariants
must be limited in such theories to avoid singularities.
we have found that in both the einstein frame and the
string frame, the method proposed here ensures that all
physical invariants remain nite, and produces bounc-
ing nonsingular cosmological solutions. the graceful exit
problem of pre-big-bang cosmology is solved naturally by
our construction both in the einstein and string frames.
the connection with pre-big-bang cosmology will be ex-
plored further in a future publication.
