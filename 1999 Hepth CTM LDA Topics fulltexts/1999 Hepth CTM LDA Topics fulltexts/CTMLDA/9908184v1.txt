s-matrix identities in ane toda field theories

abstract

we note that s-matrix/conserved charge identities in ane toda eld theories of the type
recently noted by khastgir can be put on a more systematic footing. this makes use of a result
rst found by ravanini, tateo and valleriani for theories based on the simply-laced lie algebras
(a, d and e) which we extend to the nonsimply-laced case. we also present the generalisation
to nonsimply-laced cases of the observation - for simply-laced situations - that the conserved
charges form components of the eigenvectors of the cartan matrix.

introduction

ane toda eld theory (atft) is a massive scalar eld theory in 1+1 dimensions, with a
lagrangian of the form

l =

the i, j = 1, . . . , r are the simple roots of a rank-r semi-simple lie algebra g, 0 being the
ane root. there exists an atft related to each possible (twisted or untwisted) dynkin diagram;
quantum scattering matrices (s-matrices) were rst found for the simply-laced cases [1, 2, 3], and
later for nonsimply laced cases [4, 5]. for theories based on nonself-dual algebras, the algebras
fall naturally into dual pairs (b(1)
6 ). the s-matrix for
the second member of each pair is related to that of the rst by the strong/weak coupling duality

in a recent paper, khastgir [10] noted that there existed product identities on elements of these
s-matrices, all evaluated at the same rapidity, associated with sum rules for the conserved charges
of the theory. for example, he noted that in a(1)

where sab() is an element of the s-matrix evaluated at rapidity , and qx
s is the xth conserved
charge at spin s. the above is true for any s, with non-trivial independent conserved charges
existing for s an exponent of the lie algebra. this is a consequence of the fact - rst noted in [2]
(see also [12]) - that the coecients of a fourier series expansion of the logarithmic derivative of
the s-matrix provide solutions to the conserved-charge bootstrap. if we dene

then the linearly independent rows and columns of (k) each satisfy the conserved charge bootstrap,
and so are proportional to the unique vector qk, implying (k)
k. this does allow the

possibility that some of the matrices (k) are zero, making their relationship to the conserved
charges trivial, but we shall see later that this does not happen, at least for generic couplings.

khastgir did not give a general prescription as to how to nd such s-matrix identities, beyond
noting that some can be written down by inspecting the product-form s-matrix. we give such a
prescription, and also expand the list of identities to cases when not all the s-matrices are evaluated
at the same rapidity.

in order to nd these identities, we need to make use of an identity found by ravanini, tateo
and valleriani (rtv) [14] for simply-laced cases, and to generalise it to nonsimply-laced cases. we
establish this fundamental identity in section 2 before using it, in section 3, to generate further
s-matrix identities.

2 the basic identities

in simply-laced cases, ravanini, tateo and valleriani [14] found

(4)

for the minimal s-matrix and gave a general proof based on the geometric formulae of [6]. this
identity also holds for the full s-matrix. here, g is the incidence matrix of the dynkin diagram of
the lie algebra, h is the coxeter number, and  is the step function

there also exist integral formulae for the s-matrix, given by oota [13] and frenkel and
reshetikhin [8]; these can be used to prove rtvs formula but, since they apply to all simple
lie algebras, can also be used to generalise (4) to nonsimply-laced cases.

before we can present ootas formula, we must break o to provide a few denitions. we
shall work with the untwisted algebras here, since the s-matrices for the theories based on twisted
2n will be
algebras can be found through the duality transformation.
discussed at the end of this section.) firstly, let h be the dual coxeter number, r be the
maximum number of edges connecting any two vertices of the dynkin diagram, and 0  b  2
be a function of the coupling constant, conjectured to be [1, 2, 3, 7]

this is 1 for the a, d and e series, 2 for f4 and 3 for g2.
thus ti = 1 for short roots and ti = r for long roots.

where, for conciseness, we have dened h = i(2b)
frenkel and reshetikhin [8] is similar to this, but misses the factor of (1)ab exp(cid:16)r 

2rh . the formula given by
k eikab(cid:17).

for real , this is 1 except when  = 0, in which case it becomes -1 for a = b. including the factor
or not thus amounts to selecting the value of saa(0); without the factor, sab(0) = 1, but with it
sab(0) = (1)ab. this second is the value taken by the product form s-matrix.

form r 

the rhs, as written, involves a divergent integral, but it is implicit in ootas formulation that any
terms which are navely divergent must be analytically continued. the divergent terms are of the
k eikex|k|, for some real positive x. this is a standard fourier transform which, for x
negative, has the result 2i tan1  
x . this implies that the analytic continuation x  x to x
positive should just introduce a minus sign. thus each divergent term of this type with x positive
should be replaced by the same term with x  x and an additional minus sign. when the dust
settles, this reduces the whole rhs to 1 and, in the end, we obtain the simple result

ey = (1)gab exp(cid:18)z 



dk
k

eik[gab]q(k)(cid:19) .

(12)

taking account of the fact that the matrix gab only has integer-valued entries (with 0  gab  3),
we can list the possible values of [gab]q(k) as 0, 1, cosh bk
2rh for gab = 0, 1, 2, 3
respectively. since we have just argued that terms in the integral involving a cosh function reduce
to one, the integral becomes the fourier transform of 1
k for gab odd and zero otherwise. as a
result, this turns out to be equivalent to y = 2igab(), showing that we have indeed found a
straightforward generalisation of rtvs result to nonsimply-laced cases. as an aside, we should
note that, had we started from frenkel and reshetikhins s-matrix formula instead of ootas, we
would have found y = 0 instead.

2rh , 1 + cosh 2bk

to complete this section, we must discuss the exceptional case a(2)

2n . being self-dual, the s-
matrix for this theory cannot be found from the above. following oota, however, we note that the
necessary prescription is to replace each reference to rh by h = h = 2n + 1, take all ta = 1, and
replace the incidence matrix by the generalised incidence matrix [11], which is obtained from
the incidence matrix of a(1)
n by replacing the last zero on the the diagonal by a one. doing this,
we obtain the correct integral s-matrix, and hence a generalised rtv identity, for this case.

3 multi-linear identities

the rtv result and its generalisation allow us to perform a simple trick and generate a large
number of s-matrix identities. interchanging i and j in (10) does not change the lhs if ti = tj -
the two roots are the same length - due to the symmetry of the s-matrix, so we can equate the
rhs before and after interchanging to get

r

yl=1

gil

yn=1

sjl( + (2n  1  gil)h ) =

r

gjl

yl=1

yn=1

sil( + (2n  1  gjl)h).

(13)

(note that the presence or absence of an exponential factor does not aect this, as ti = tj ensures
gij = gji.) if i and j are such that the corresponding rows of the incidence matrix consist of
entries no greater than 1, this reduces to

r

yl=1

sil()glj =

r

yl=1

sjl()gli,

(14)

and we can obtain identities for products of s-matrix elements, all evaluated at the same rapidity;
the rst example, (2), is one of this set. now, however, we also have identities in which not all
rapidities are equal.

to generalise the connection between s-matrix product identities and conserved charge sum

rules to this case, we can take logarithmic derivatives to nd that if

ya,b{i,j}

sab( + if 1

ab) = ya,b{i,j}

sab( + if 2

ab),

for some sets {i, j} and {i, j} then

xa,b{i,j}

applying this to (13) gives

where it should be noted that the sums over n and n in (13) have been absorbed by the introduction
of the [gab]q(s) notation.

to give a simple example of this result in action, in the b(1)

algebra we have, for 1 < i < r  1

4 other observations

in the simply-laced cases, the conserved charges can be simply characterised as components of the
eigenvectors of the cartan matrix [11]. taking the logarithmic derivative of the formula (10) and
proceeding as before allows us to generalise this to nonsimply-laced cases, as follows:

r

xl=1

[gil]q(is)ql

s = 2 cos(cid:20)s(cid:18) 2  b

2h

+

bti

2rh(cid:19)(cid:21) qi
s.

(20)

note now, however, that the ti in the cos term stops this from being a proper eigenvalue equation
in the nonsimply-laced cases. in simply-laced cases, this reduces to the known eigenvector result,
since [n]q = n for n = 0, 1 (as all entries of the incidence matrix are in these cases), and we have
all ti = 1 and h = rh. rearranging, this can also be stated as

r

xl=1

[kil]q(is)q(is)ql

s = 0.

(21)

we can also nd a relation between the matrix m and the conserved charges. noting that the
s-matrix expression (9) explicitly contains the matrix m , we rst take the logarithmic derivative,
and then note that the resulting integral can be re-expressed as a contour integral over the upper
half-plane. the only poles in this expression are in the matrix m , so, before we can continue, we
must nd a formula for this. if we recall that the s-matrix can be written in a product form [7] as

sab() =

h

rh

yx=1

yy=1

{x, y}mab(x,y)

(22)

(where the {x, y} are standard building blocks, and the mab(x, y)s are integers), and compare with
ootas integral form, we can nd a formula for m as

mab(q, q) =

h

rh

xx=1

xy=1

mab(x, y)

qxqy  qxqy

qhqrh  qhqrh .

(23)

this shows that the only poles present are at k = im, m being any integer, so the result is that we
can re-express the integral in the form of a fourier expansion, and thus read o a relation between
(s)
ab and m as

(s)
ab = 2 sin s  sinh sh  sinh sh  m (q(is), q(is)).

(24)

of course, to nd an expression in qa

s qb

is the ith component of a rank-r algebra, we could use qa

s, we need to include a scaling factor. noting that
s =

s qb

pr
siqb
i=1 qa
si = ab, where si
(s)
i=1 (si)
ab /pr
11 .

combining this with the expression for m , we get

(s)
ab = 2 sinh sh  sinh sh

rh

xy=1

mab(x, y) sin(cid:18) s

2 (cid:20) (2  b)x

h

+

by

rh(cid:21)(cid:19) .

(25)

from this, it is straightforward to see that the matrix (s)
is non-zero for generic b by simple
ab
case-by-case analysis. (this is dierent from this minimal case where, as noted by klassen and
melzer [11], we can get a zero matrix for s = h
2 in simply-laced cases, even if that exponent
is present.) had there been cases where (s) was zero for some s, then taking the logarithmic
derivative of an s-matrix identity would sometimes have resulted in a trivial conserved charge
identity. as it is, however, we can always derive a non-trivial conserved charge identity from an
s-matrix identity and vice versa.

5 conclusions

we have found a generalisation of the rtv identity to nonsimply-laced cases, and, from this, a
way of generating s-matrix identities of the type recently discussed by khastgir. it is still an open
question as to whether we have found all such identities, or merely a subset. in addition, we note
that we can always use the technique of taking logarithmic derivatives to generate corresponding
identities for the conserved charges.

while this note was in preparation, the result (10) was also reported by fring, kor and
schulz [9] as their combined bootstrap identity (we have altered our notation to accord with
theirs). they proceeded by a geometrical argument, and went on to derive ootas formula. an im-
portant distinction, however, is that their bootstrap identity does not have the factor e2igab(),
and they nd frenkel and reshetikhins version of the formula, rather than ootas.

the discrepancy (which is only evident at  = 0) arises from dierent methods of treating the
  0 limit. the simplest way to see the distinction is to look at the lhs of (10); if we view it as

lim

xh+tih

lim
0

sij( + x)sij (  x)

(26)

(as we would if we then went on to use it in the thermodynamic bethe ansatz approach) then it
becomes just the unitarity constraint on s, and thus is equal to 1, meaning that we must introduce
the exponential factor to take account of the fact that saa(0) = 1 (fks work with product-form
s-matrices and thus assume this). if we take the limits in the other order, then (as can be seen if
the s-matrix is written out in block form) the result becomes -1 if there is a pole at h + tih and
so we do not need to introduce the exponential factor. fks implicitly assumed the second case,
and so found no additional factor, while rtv and oota took the rst. in nding their integral
form for the s-matrix, however, fks reverted to the rst limit ordering, which explains how they
could begin their argument with saa(0) = 1 and yet derive an integral s-matrix with saa(0) = 1.
