abstract

spacetime is modelled as a homogeneous manifold given by the classes
of unitary u(2) operations in the general complex operations gl( ic2). the
residual representations of this noncompact symmetric space of rank two are
characterized by two continuous real invariants, one invariant interpreted as a
particle mass for a positive unitary subgroup and the second one for an indef-
inite unitary subgroup related to nonparticle interpretable interaction ranges.
fields represent nonlinear spacetime gl( ic2)/u(2) by their quantization and
include necessarily nonparticle contributions in the timelike part of their at
space feynman propagator.

1.1 some historical remarks

newtons interpretation of space and time having an absolute ontology (two
unaected boxes wherein the physical objects play around) was by far more
successful in the development of physical theories than leibnizs opinion, who
considered time and position space as relations, as labels to express their trans-
formation properties. with einstein the two boxes became one spacetime box
aected by and aecting the gravitational interaction.

weyl[11] made the rst attempt to unify einsteins gravity with maxwells
electrodynamics by explaining the electromagnetic interactions as eected by
elds which connect and compatibilize spacetime dependent transformations
from the noncompact abelian dilatation group d(1) = exp ir. this gauge idea,
used for the wrong patient, was fruitful by switching over from the noncom-
pact d(1) to the apparently right patient, the compact abelian transformation
group u(1) = exp i ir, a real lie group dened in the complex. therewith a
dichotomy between external spacetime transformations with the lorentz group
o(1, 3) and internal unitary transformations comprising the electromagnetic
group u(1) was established. the internal transformation group proliferated,
the experimental and theoretical favourites being today the compact stan-
dard model interaction gauge groups u(1), su(2) and su(3) for hypercharge,
isospin and colour resp.

general relativity and electrodynamics came originally in real formulations,
whereas quantum theory with its probability amplitudes, characteristic phase
relations (transition elements) and u(1)-invariant scalar product was born as
a complex theory. the gauge approach ties the electromagnetic interaction to
the u(1)-phases of complex matter elds. the complex representation of the
internal compact real lie group does not t easily in a real representation struc-
ture of the external transformations with the poincare group, i.e. the vector
spaces ir3 and ir4 for position space and spacetime translations resp. acted
on by the rotation and the lorentz group, o(3) and o(1, 3) resp. but complex
representations came rather early also for the real spacetime transformations:
the twofold split of a ray with silver atoms in the original stern-gerlach ex-
periment was the starting point to replace the rotation group so(3) with their
real irreducible representation spaces, necessarily odd dimensional, e.g. real
3-dimensional position space, by its twofold covering spin group su(2). for
the lorentz group, this entailed the transition to the complex represented real2
ir) covering the orthochronous group so+(1, 3). in a rather
lie group sl( ic2
loose external-internal unication both groups, the lorentz sl( ic2
ir) and the
electromagnetic u(1) transformations come together as subgroups of the full
real 8-dimensional group gl( ic2
ir) with a central correlation [16]. this group
is represented directly by the transformations of charged spinor elds, e.g. of
the right handed lepton isosinglet elds in the standard model of electroweak
2the subindex ir at the complex numbers ic ir = ir  i ir indicates its use as a complex represented
ir) are

real structure. the complex 3-dimensional lie group sl( ic2) and the real 6-dimensional one sl( ic2
kept apart by this - perhaps overcautious - notation.

2

and strong interactions. in contrast to such an external-internal unication of
the lorentz group with the abelian hypercharge u(1) in gl( ic2
ir) a unica-
tion of the nonabelian groups su(2) and su(3) for isospin and colour with
sl( ic2

ir) remains an open problem[17, 18].

1.2 equations of motion?

the replacement of a nally oriented causality in aristotelian physics by time
derivative equations of motions with initial conditions was, as a method, the
most important progress initiated by newton. subsequently, equations of mo-
tion were derived from hamiltonians and lagrangians using extremal princi-
ples.
in the course of the last century hamiltonians and lagrangians were
more and more motivated and constructed as invariants with respect to trans-
formation lie groups and lie algebras.

in quantum mechanics the operational structures of physics come into full
bloom[5]: the equations of motions can be interpreted as the transformations
with the lie group exp t  d(1), modelling time, expressed via the adjoint
action d
dt a = [ih, a] with a hermitian hamiltonian h giving a basis ih for
the time translation lie algebra3 log d(1) = ir. the action of time and its
diagonalization is an algebraic eigenvalue problem [h, a] = e(a)a - an equation
of motion is its dierential formulation only, i.e. d

dt = i ad h.

in the characteristic example of a quantum harmonic oscillator the time
action diagonalization gives integer energy eigenvalues. the involved represen-
tation of time d(1)  u(1) by a unitary group establishes the probability
structure since u(1) is the invariance group of a scalar product for the complex
representation space. everything else, the denition of position and momen-
tum as real linear combinations of creation and annihilation operators, which
express the notion linear duality, the construction of a hilbert space with
normalizable wave functions etc. are formulations for the basic u(1)-repre-
sentation structure of time adapted for the description of experiments in the
classical physics oriented language.

the same procedure can be given explicitely e.g.

for the not so trivial
nonrelativistic hydrogen atom as done by fock[4] using the rotation-perihel
invariance group of the kepler dynamics, i.e. so(4) = su(2)su(2)
(compact,
{1}
i.e. denite unitary) for bound states and so+(1, 3) = sl( ic2
ir)/{1} (real,
but indenite unitary) for scattering states, to determine the hamiltonian as
invariant and to give the denite u(1) and indenite u(1, 1) unitarity structure
resp. of the time action representations.

so far in quantum eld theory, a replacement of the equations of motion,
e.g. in the standard model, by a purely algebraic transformation theory with
eigenvalues and eigenvectors - as seems appropriate for a quantum theory -
which cannot only describe the scattering of particles but also derive, in a
bound state structure, their existence and their properties in terms of eigen-
values has not succeeded yet. in the following, i shall try some steps on this
route.

3the lie algebra for the lie group g is denoted as logarithm log g.

1.3 the particle prejudice

relativistic quantum eld theory is often praised as a progress in so far as inter-
actions and particles are unied - all interactions are parametrizable by particle
elds. even if such a viewpoint is qualied by extending the particle language
also to o-shell energy-momenta, i.e. for mass m particles to energy-momenta
q with q2 6= m2, it is simply not true. apart from quarks and gluons as strong
interaction parametrizing elds postulated without particle asymptotics (con-
nement), the most prominent example is the classical spinless coulomb in-
teraction which comes in the quantum electromagnetic lorentz vector eld

a(x) = (cid:16) a0 + a3 a1  ia2
a1 + ia2 a0  a3 (cid:17)(x) with four components. the so+(1, 3)-lorentz
vector properties with maximal abelian subgroup so(2)  so+(1, 1) leads
to a unitary u(2)  u(1, 1)-metric. as seen in the harmonic analysis with
energy-momentum dependent creation and annihilation operators only the two
transversal components, related to a u(2)-scalar product are particle inter-
pretable as left and right circularily polarized photons. from the remaining
two components with indenite u(1, 1)-sesquilinear form one component is
related to the gauge degree of freedom, and the last 4th degree of freedom
describes a quantum eld interaction without particle parametrization[15].

an unreected one to one correspondence of quantum elds with parti-
cles is similar and somewhat related to a supercial naive interpretation of

x1  ix2

x0  x3 (cid:17) as

x1 + ix2

lorentz transformations for spacetime translations x = (cid:16) x0 + x3

blurring the dierence between time and position space. obviously, the situ-
ation is more subtle. also in special relativity, timelike and spacelike trans-
lations det x = x2 > 0 and x2 < 0 resp. are lorentz operation compatible
concepts - they are clearly distinct, but no longer linear subspaces. the rela-
tivity of time translations ir and position space translations ir3 can be seen
in the homogeneous nonlinear structure of the absolute concepts timelike
and spacelike. with the xgroups (little groups) so(3), so(1, 2) and the
semidirect so(2)~ ir2 for timelike, spacelike and lightlike translations resp.
and the dilatation group d(1) = exp ir one has the nonlinear manifolds for
the nontrivial spacetime translations

spacelike :
lightlike future (past) : so+(1, 3)/so(2)~ ir2

the properties of free particle elds are encoded in feynman propagators4,

d(1)  so+(1, 3)/so(1, 2) = gl( ic2

with the on-shell quantization causally supported, i.e. [, ](x) = 0 for x2 <
0.
if one uses a rest system in linear spacetime and, therewith, a basis for
time translations in an obviously not lorentz compatible decomposition in
time and position space, timelike translations (x0, ~x) with x2 > 0 have in
4the translation compatible shorthand (anti)commutator notation [a, b](x y) = [a(y), b(x)] is used.

general also a nontrivial linear position space component ~x.
in relativistic
eld theories, the position space dependence of nonrelativistic interactions like
the yukawa or coulomb interaction does not arise from spacelike translations,
but from timelike ones x2 > 0, in the example above from the o-shell causal
contribution involving the principal value integration p

which is also spacelike supported, is relevant for the asymptotic particle inter-
pretation. the causally supported o-shell part (x0)[, ](x) in the feynman
propagator is a particle related contribution to a more complicated spacetime
representation structure as will be elaborated in the 3rd chapter. i think that
relativistic quantum theory using particle related elds only is incomplete and
unsatisfactory with respect to its causal spacetime representation content.

1.4 the complication of spacetime theories

spacetime operations are both nonabelian and noncompact.

the nondecomposable representations of compact-abelian transformations
are complex 1-dimensional, of compact-nonabelian transformations complex
nite dimensional, both with rational eigenvalues[3, 6] - as physical properties
called e.g. winding, charge or spin numbers. as for the noncompact transfor-
mations, the irreducible representations in the abelian case are still complex
1-dimensional, in the nonabelian case in general innite dimensional[7, 8], in
both cases with a continuous spectrum - as physical properties called energies
(frequencies) masses or interaction ranges.

5

if we insist in the causality compatible orthochronous lorentz group so+(1, 3)

we have to face the representation complications of noncompact-nonabelian
transformations.

2 spacetime as transformations

in this chapter a model for spacetime is proposed with spacetime points as
classes of transformations.

2.1 a mathematical remark on naturalness

in mathematics, there exist natural structures connected with the solution of
universal problems[2] which may be supercially characterized as follows: a
given structure gives rise to new ones by considering its internal relations, e.g.
its selftransformations as binary relations.

some well known elementary examples: each abelian semigroup with can-
cellation rule is naturally extendable to a unique group structure. this is used
for the extension of the natural numbers to the integer ones as binary internal
relations modulo an addition + induced equivalence +

zz = in in

+



with (n1, n2) + (m1, m2)  n1 + m2 = m1 + n2

or for the extension of the integers as ring to the rationals as its unique eld
structure with a multiplication  induced equivalence 

iq = zz[ zz\{0}]





with (z1, z2)  (u1, u2)  z1u2 = u1z2

by considering cauchy series as countably innite relations, each metrical
space has its unique naturally cauchy completed space. this is used for the
extension of the rationals iq with their natural order induced metric to the
reals ir = iq0/ c with a cauchy series induced equivalence c.
another example is the natural structure of multilinearity: each vector
space gives rise to a unique unital associative algebra structure, its tensor
algebra. dierent quotient algebras can be related to the algebras used in
classical and quantum theories[14].

2.2 adjoint transformation structures

some natural concepts involving binary internal relations are called adjoint.
they play a paramount role in physical theories, not only for gauge elds.
with respect to real and complex lie transformation groups and algebras (al-
ways nite dimensional if not stated explicitly otherwise) such adjoint concepts
describe the action of the transformations on themselves and lead to charac-
teristic doublings.

the adjoint doubling will be illustrated with the example of the real 3-di-
mensional position space whose translations, formalized by a vector space ir3,

6

with the action of a rotation group so(3) constitute a euclidean semidirect
product group

so(3)~ ir3 with product (o1, ~x1)  (o2, ~x2) = (o1o2, ~x1 + o2(~x2))

so(3)~ ir3 is an example for an adjoint ane lie group where, in general,
a lie group g is represented in the automorphisms of the vector space structure
of its lie algebra log g

g  log g  log g,
int g1  int g2 = int g1g2

(g, x) 7 int g(x) = g  x  g1

the adjoint group representation is faithful for the adjoint group int g, dened
by the classes of the group elements with respect to the centrum, i.e. the kernel
of the group representation int

int g~log g,
with product (g1, x1)  (g2, x2) = (g1g2, x1 + int g1(x2))

int g = g/ centr g

the linear underlining of the lie algebra log g indicates that only its linear
vector space structure is relevant for this adjoint doubling, the lie bracket of
the 2nd factor has to be forgotten.

the euclidean group for position space, mentioned above, is the adjoint

ane group of the spin group su(2)

so(3)~ ir3 = int su(2)~log su(2),
with product (u1, x1)  (u2, x2) = (u1u2, x1 + u  x2  u)

centr su(2) = {12}

starting from the dening and fundamental complex 2-dimensional pauli
su(2)-representation by u = exp i~~ with spin j = 1
2 which - up to equiv-
alence - gives all irreducible su(2)-representations [2j], j = 0, 1
2, 1, . . . with
dimension (1 + 2j) by totally symmetrical tensor products, one obtains the
position space translations with the adjoint spin representation [2] as vector
space structure of the spin lie algebra, in a leibnizian interpretation as binary
relations (traceless linear mappings) for pauli spinors
position space translations = log su(2) = ir3
log su(2) = {x : ic2
the rotations are realized by the adjoint representation

the position space metric comes as negative denite killing form, inherited
from the spin lie algebra, i.e. the su(2)-invariant double trace tr x  y, with
the quadratic form as the determinant x2 = 1
for a lie algebra l, the adjoint ane lie algebra is dened by the ad-
joint representation which realizes the lie bracket by the commutator of the
endomorphisms of its vector space structure

2 tr x  x =  det x.

l  l  l,
ad [l1, l2] = [ ad l1, ad l2]

(l, x) 7 ad l(x) = [l, x]

7

only the adjoint lie algebra ad l given by the classes of the lie algebra with
respect to the centrum is faithfully represented. the adjoint ane lie algebra
is as vector space the direct sum ad l  l and as lie algebra the semidirect
bracket product, denoted by the direct sum-semidirect lie bracket symbol ~

ad l ~ l = {l + x
with bracket [l1 + x1, l2 + x2] = [l1, l2] + ad l1(x2)  ad l2(x1)

ad l = l/ centr l

l, x  l},

the second factor l in this adjoint doubling is the vector space structure of
the lie algebra.

for euclidean position space, the adjoint ane lie algebra for the angular

momenta log so(3) is the lie algebra of the euclidean group
log so(3) ~ ir3 = log su(2) ~ log su(2)

both adjoint doublings, the adjoint ane group and the adjoint ane lie
algebra, are related to the realization of a group g on itself by inner automor-
phisms

g  g  g,
int g1  int g2 = int g1g2

(g, a) 7 int g(a) = gag1

leading to the adjoint group doubling as the semidirect product

int g~g = {(g, a)
with product (g1, a1)  (g2, a2) = (g1g2, a1 int g(a2))

g, a  g}

each semidirect group g ~g is isomorphic to a subgroup of the adjoint group
doubling int g~g which is universal in this sense.
the adjoint doubling of the spin group is its semidirect product with the
rotation group

so(3)~su(2)

2.3 spacetime and the causal poincare group

for a lie group g with lie algebra log g one has the three semidirect adjoint
doublings, reecting two steps of innitesimalization

they were discussed in the last section for the unitary spin group u = u1 
su(2) with the rotations so(3) as adjoint group and the position space trans-
lations ir3 as vector space structure of the spin lie algebra log su(2).

what about spacetime? the spacetime translations ir4 (minkowski space)
with the orthochronous lorentz group action constitute the semidirect product
poincare group

so+(1, 3)~ ir4

the poincare group is not the adjoint ane lie group of the real 6-dimensional
lie group sl( ic2

int sl( ic2

ir)~log sl( ic2
int sl( ic2

ir) = so+(1, 3)~ ir6
ir) = sl( ic2

ir)/{12} = so+(1, 3)

this real 12-dimensional group is relevant for the gauge structures in minkow-
ski space where the curvature elds, e.g. the electromagnetic eld strenghts
j,k=0 = { ~e, ~b}, represent the real 6-dimensional vector space
{f jk = f kj}3
structure of the lorentz lie algebra with the adjoint lorentz group action.
at rst sight it seems unnatural to relate the real 4-dimensional minkowski
translations ir4 to the real 6-dimensional lorentz lie algebra log so+(1, 3) =
log sl( ic2
ir). however, it is exactly the complex representation of the real
covering group sl( ic2
ir) which makes this relation natural in the mathematical
sense. only in this context, the poincare group for at spacetime can be
understood as arising from an adjoint doubling, i.e. related to internal relations
of a transformation group.

in the case of complex represented real transformations there are two kinds
of adjoint structures. it may be helpful to give the construction rst in abstract
terms:
if a semigroup g has a reection (conjugation), i.e. an involutive
contra-automorphism dened by

 : g  g, g = g,

(gh) = hg

it denes its -symmetric domain as the subset
d(g) = {d  g

d = d}

the concatenation of the inversion of a group g as canonical group reection
with any reection (conjugation)  is an involutive automorphism

 : g  g, g = (g1) = (g)1

the invariants for this automorphism constitute the -unitary subgroup

u(g) = {u  g

u1 = u}

for a group with conjugation both the symmetric domain d(g) and the uni-
tary subgroup u(g) can be used for adjoint structures.

physically relevant examples used in the following are the full general com-
plex linear groups gl( icn
ir), considered as real lie groups and denable by the
nonsingular complex n  n-matrices with the hermitian matrix conjugation .
they will be used for time in the case n = 1 and for spacetime with n = 2.
the group gl( icn
ir) has the real n2-dimensional submanifold d(n) as its sym-
metric domain and the real n2-dimensional lie subgroup u(n) as the group
with the invariants

d(n) = {d  gl( icn
ir)

d = d}, u(n) = {u  gl( icn
ir)

u = u1}

9

the symmetric domain is a symmetric space[9] with the maximal compact
group as xgroup.
it is the direct product of the abelian group d(1n) =
1n exp ir and the globally symmetric space sd(n) = sl( icn

ir)/su(n)

d(n) = gl( icn

ir)/u(n) = d(1n)  sl( icn

ir)/su(n)

back to the general structure: a group g with two reections, g  g
(conjugation) and g  g1 (inversion), gives rise to two types of adjoint dou-
blings. the inversion induced inner automorphisms of the group g described
in the former section

g  g  g,
int g1  int g2 = int g1g2, kern int g = centr g

(g, a) 7 int g(a) = gag1 = (gag)

are, in general, not compatible with the conjugation. in addition and analogy
to the inner automorphisms int, the group g allows the conjugation compatible
bijections, denoted by int 
g  g  g,
int g1  int g2 = int g1g2

(g, a) 7 int g(a) = gag = (gag)

also these bijections constitute a realization of the group g with the kernel
dening the faithfully realized classes int g

kern int  = {h  g

int g = g/ kern int 

hgh = h for all g  g}

for the unitary elements u  u(g) the bijections coincide with the inner
automorphisms, i.e.
int u = int u, not, however, in general. the analogue
structure to the adjoint group doubling int g~g is given by the action of the
conjugation compatible bijections on the symmetric domain d(g), which will
be called the adjoint symmetric transformation space

int g~d(g)

which, in general in contrast to int g~g, is no semidirect product group.
the two types of adjoint doublings are illustrated for the physically relevant
examples gl( icn): one obtains for the complex case ic with the inversion and
for the complex represented real one ic ir with the conjugation

conjugation:

int gl( icn) = gl( icn)/gl( ic) = sl( icn)/ ii(n)

leads to the adjoint group doublings and the adjoint symmetric transformation
spaces

ir) = gl( icn

n = 1 :( inversion:
n = 2 :( inversion:

int gl( ic)~gl( ic) = gl( ic)
int gl( ic ir)~d(1) = d(1)~d(1)
int gl( ic2)~gl( ic2) = sl( ic2)/ ii(2)~gl( ic2)
int gl( ic2

ir)~d(2) = [d(12)  so+(1, 3)]~d(2)
10

for spacetime with n = 2 the conjugate adjoint action involves the direct
product of the orthochronous lorentz group and the dilatation group d(12),
called causal group in this context.

obviously for lie symmetries the adjoint lie group structures are lineariz-
able with lie algebra structures, rst in general: for a lie group g with
reection (conjugation), the lie algebra log g inherits the reection (conjuga-
tion). therefore, it is the direct sum of the -antisymmetrical lie subalgebra
l = l as lie algebra of the unitary lie subgroup and the isomorphic -
symmetrical vector subspace x = +x as tangent structure of the symmetric
manifold d(g) = g/u(g)

log g = log g  log g+, ( log g = log u(g)

log g+ = log g/ log u(g)

in the example above one has in addition to the lie algebra log u(n) as u(n)-
tangent space a real n2-dimensional vector subspace ir(n) as tangent space
of the symmetrical domain d(n) which, for n = 2, will be used as spacetime
translations (minkowski space)

log gl( icn

ir) = log u(n)  ir(n)

ir(n) = log gl( icn

ir)/ log u(n) = irn2

in addition to the adjoint ane lie group int g~log g involving the inver-
sion as natural reection one has now also the conjugate adjoint representation
of the group on its lie algebra

g  log g  log g, (g, m) 7 int g(m) = g  m  g = (g  m  g)
int g1  int g2 = int g1g2

which, with the conjugation compatibility, can be restricted to the symmetrical
and antisymmetrical vector subspaces of log g. the conjugate adjoint ane
lie group is dened with the symmetrical subspace as translations

int g~ log g+

with respect to the two adjoint doublings int g~log g with inversion and
int g~ log g+ with conjugation one obtains in the spacetime relevant exam-
ple (n = 2) for the 2nd case the poincare group with an additional causal
group action

the indenite signature sign g = (1, 3).

2.4 spacetime as unitary operation classes

to summarize the salient structures of the last section which will be used in the
following: the conjugate adjoint operation structure for the group gl( icn
ir)
suggests the denition of nonlinear models for time and spacetime as symmetric
domains for complex linear transformations where the spacetime points are
the complex linear operations modulo the maximal compact unitary operation
group

time (n = 1): d(1) = exp ir

ir)/u(n)

spacetime (n = 2): d(2) = d(12)  so+(1, 3)/so(3)

time comes as group, spacetime as homogeneous manifold. d(n) is the orien-
tation manifold[11] of scalar products in n dimensions [16].

the translations are the corresponding tangent structures

spacetime translations (n = 2):

the conjugate adjoint ane group is the semidirect causal poincare group

[d(12)  so+(1, 3)]~ ir(2)

here in the conjugate adjoint doubling, the causal structure and the boost
structure arises twice - globally as d(12) and so+(1, 3)/so(3) and in the
tangent space ir(2) = ir  ir3 as time and position space translations where
the decomposition is incompatible with the so+(1, 3)-action.

3 representations of spacetime

in analogy to lie groups and algebras also spacetime in the symmetric space
model d(2) = gl( ic2
ir)/u(2) has linear representations. these representa-
tions will be constructed as residues in analogy to the representations of time,
modelled by the group d(1) = exp ir, which is used in the quantization of the
quantum mechanical basic dual pair position-momentum.

3.1 quantum representations of time

a dynamics is a representation of time, expressed in quantum mechanics by
the noncommutativity of the generating operators. in the simplest cases of a
harmonic oscillator or of a free mass point one has the time dependent com-
mutation relations of the dual position-momentum pair (x, p) which generates
the operator algebra

tum represented with the hamiltonian, e.g. for the harmonic oscillator with
creation and annihilation operator (u, u)

translation eigenvalues m  ir (frequencies, energies). in the case of a compact

3.2 the representation defect of particle fields

particle elds are appropriate to describe free particles, i.e. representations of
the spacetime tangent structures leading to the particle characterization by a
causal translation property mass m 6= 0 or m = 0 with a rotation property
su(2)-spin and a u(1)-polarization resp.[12] what about representations of
the nonlinear global spacetime model

d(2) = d(12)  so+(1, 3)/so(3)

which contains the rotation classes of the lorentz transformations in addition
to the causal group?

an appropriate example is a dirac eld  for a particle with nontrivial

mass m, e.g. for the electron-positron, with the quantization

{, }(x) = r d4q

= 0(~x) for x0 = 0

(2)3 (q0)(kqk + m)(q2  m2)exiq

causally supported, i.e. {, }(x) = 0 for x2 < 0.
matrices k = (12, ~) = k

achieved alone by particle elds, genuine spacetime nonparticle eld contribu-
tions have to occur.

3.3 residual representations for u(1) and d(1)
the lie algebra log u(n) = i ir(n) and the spacetime translations ir(n) are
unitarily diagonalizable with n cartan coordinates in the polar decomposition

ir(n) = irn  su(n)/u(1)n1 : ( i = u()  i diag   u()
x = u(x)  diag x  u(x)

d(n) = d(1)n  su(n)/u(1)n1 : ex = u(x)  e diag x  u(x)

corresponding manifold products hold for the boost structure and the simple
lie symmetry

su(n) = u(1)n1  su(n)/u(1)n1 :
sd(n) = d(1)n1  su(n)/u(1)n1 :

tr  = 0
tr x = 0

the cartan subsymmetry for the compact groups su(n) and u(n) given by
u(1)-powers (tori) has its analogue in the d(1)-powers (planes) as noncompact
cartan subsymmetry for the boost and causal symmetric spaces sd(n) and
d(n).

the unitary irreducible representations of the abelian group gl( ic ir) =
d(1)  u(1), necessarily 1-dimensional, have to be in u(1) since there is only
one unitarity type in gl( ic ir). they must have an imaginary weight for the
noncompact group d(1) = ir and an integer winding number for the periodic
phase group u(1) = ir/ zz

in contrast to time and because of the additional indenite so+(1, 1) boost
structure such spacetime elds cannot be interpreted in terms of positive metric
particles only. supplementing the residual spacetime representation which can
be taken as a causally supported quantization in at tangent spacetime by
an fock state value for the quantization opposite commutator, also spacelike
supported

starting from a frequency m for the creation operator u of an harmonic os-
cillator the freqencies nm for the powers un with natural n arise as singularities
by convolutions of the basic representations etim in the residual representation.
similarily a fundamental spacetime representation [m2
3, 1] may give rise to
product representations whose positive metric singularities have a particle in-
terpretation. to this end the convolution, appropriate for the abelian time
group d(1) = gl( ic ir)/u(1), has to be generalized to a convolution for the
nonabelian spacetime symmetric space d(2) = gl( ic2

0, m2

ir)/u(2).

as another genuine spacetime feature the class property of the spacetime

elements with the xgroup u(2) has to be taken into account

gl( ic2

ir)/u(2)  u(2) = d(2)  u(2)

this noncompact-compact factorization can be connected with the external-
internal dichotomy[18].
