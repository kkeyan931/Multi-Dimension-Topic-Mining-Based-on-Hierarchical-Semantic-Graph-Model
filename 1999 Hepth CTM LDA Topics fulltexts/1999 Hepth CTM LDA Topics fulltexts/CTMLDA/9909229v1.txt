we analyze the behavior of the heterotic string near an a-d-e singularity without

small instantons. this problem is governed by a strongly coupled worldsheet conformal
eld theory, which, by a combination of o() corrections and worldsheet instantons,

smooths out the singularities present in the classical geometry.

1. introduction

string compactications with n = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions  and more

generally, with eight unbroken supercharges in various dimensions  have been much stud-

ied. they are extremely rich in their behavior, yet suciently constrained to be analyzed

in detail.

the low energy supergravity obtained in n = 2 compactication to four dimensions

has scalar elds in both vector multiplets and hypermultiplets. the moduli space of vacua

(endowed with the metric that appears in the low energy eective action) is [1] locally a

product of a vector multiplet moduli space and a hypermultiplet moduli space.

a prototype of such a compactication is the heterotic string on k3  t2, which

is believed [2,3] to be dual to the type iia string on a calabi-yau threefold. (which

threefold arises here depends on the heterotic string gauge bundle.) in compactication
on k3  t2, the heterotic string dilaton is in a vector multiplet, and the type iia dilaton

is in a hypermultiplet.

as a result, the vector multiplet moduli space is independent of the type iia string

coupling, and the hypermultiplet moduli space is independent of the heterotic string cou-

pling. hence the vector multiplet moduli space can be determined, in principle, from type

iia conformal eld theory, and likewise the hypermultiplet moduli space can be deter-

mined, in principle, from heterotic string conformal eld theory. this viewpoint has been

much exploited for understanding the vector multiplet moduli space [2,4]. the hypermul-

tiplet moduli space has also been much studied,

for example in [5,6], but is rather less

understood. the present paper will be devoted to some issues on the hypermultiplet side,

from the standpoint of heterotic string conformal eld theory.

since conformal eld theory on k3  t2 is the product of conformal eld theory

on k3 with (free) conformal eld theory on t2, the essential issues will involve the k3

conformal eld theory. thus, our problem will be to study the hypermultiplet moduli space

in compactication of the heterotic string on k3. for understanding the hypermultiplets,

it does not matter much if one considers k3 compactication to six dimensions or k3  t2

compactication to four dimensions.

the claim that the moduli spaces can be computed from conformal eld theory is

subject to an important caveat: the moduli spaces have singularities, which sometimes re-

ect nonperturbative physics  like the massless hypermultiplet near a type ii conifold [7].

thus, one can in principle compute the vector multiplet and hypermultiplet moduli spaces

1

using the appropriate conformal eld theories, but one may not be able to understand

them.

an important example is the small instanton singularity of the heterotic string. the

classical supergravity solution for a small instanton [8] shows a blowup of the dilaton near

the core of a small instanton, so one must expect a nonperturbative phenomenon to occur

as an instanton shrinks to zero size. the phenomenon in question is the appearance of a

nonperturbative gauge symmetry [9]. despite its importance in heterotic string dynamics,

the small instanton singularity is in the following sense not a good illustration of the role

of heterotic string conformal eld theory. the instanton moduli space, as computed in

classical eld theory, has a small instanton singularity, which is uncorrected in going to
conformal eld theory, 1 and is interpreted nonperturbatively in terms of enhanced gauge

symmetry. thus, heterotic string conformal eld theory (as opposed to supergravity)

does not play an important role in generating the singularity. the interpretation of the

singularity is also out of reach of conformal eld theory.

in the present paper, we will

analyze an example in which heterotic string conformal eld theory does play a central

role in controlling the behavior near a classical singularity.

a hint about where to look comes from the classical equation of motion for the dilaton

, which reads schematically

2 = tr fijf ij  tr rijrij.

(1.1)

here 2 is the laplacian, fij is the yang-mills curvature of the gauge bundle, and rij is
the riemann tensor (regarded as a two-form valued in the lie algebra of the orthogonal

group). the crucial point is the relative minus sign between the two terms on the right

hand side of this equation.

if f is large with r zero, one is driven to strong coupling

(as is familiar from the small instanton solution [8]), while if r is large with f zero, one

is driven to weak coupling. so a singularity with large r but zero f should not lead to

nonperturbative physics, and should be understandable in the framework of conformal eld

theory.

we want a singularity that is at nite distance on the moduli space, so we will con-

centrate on the a-d-e singularities. a-d-e singularities with small instantons have been

1 a proof that for k-instanton congurations on r4, the classical instanton moduli space
coincides with the type i instanton moduli space can be found in section 2.3 of [10]. via heterotic

- type i duality, the same is therefore also true for the heterotic string.

2

much studied and give interesting nonperturbative behavior

[11-14]. we will omit the

small instantons so as to get an example governed by conformal eld theory. near the sin-

gularity, one can replace the ambient k3 manifold by an ale space (which is asymptotic
to r4/ for some nite group ;  depends on the choice of an a-d-e singularity). since

there are no small instantons, we can set f = 0. so we will study the heterotic string on
an ale space with f = 0, in the conformal eld theory limit. 2

the conformal eld theory moduli space m for the heterotic string on such a manifold

is a hyper-kahler manifold of dimension 4r, where r is the rank of the a-d-e group in

question. that m is hyper-kahler requires some explanation. in general, the hypermulti-

plet moduli space in a globally supersymmetric theory with eight unbroken supercharges

is a hyper-kahler manifold, but in the presence of gravity it is instead a quaternionic man-

ifold. focussing on the behavior near a singularity has the eect of decoupling gravity,

and that is why m is hyper-kahler.

we will focus on the simplest case of a1 = su (2), so that r = 1 and m has real

dimension four.

in this case, we will in section 2 analyze the structure of m in the

following three steps:

(1) in supergravity, one can compute directly that m = (r3  s1)/z2, where the z2

acts by multiplication by 1 on both factors.

(2) going to conformal eld theory, there is an o() correction with the following

structure. the correction is singular at the origin (the z2 xed point) in r3. let er3 be
r3 with the origin deleted. then the o() correction has the eect of replacing er3  s1
by a twisted s1 bundle over er3 (which must then be divided by z2 to get the moduli
space). since er3 is homotopic to s2, such bundles are classied by an integer-valued rst

chern class. in this case, the integer is equal to 4.

(3) there are no further worldsheet perturbative corrections to the metric of m; that
is, there are no corrections of order ()s with s > 1. however [15], there are worldsheet

instanton corrections to m. these corrections will preserve the hyper-kahler structure

of m as well as an so(3) action on m that rotates the complex structures and whose

generic orbits are three-dimensional. moreover, the worldsheet instanton corrections vanish

2 because we work at string tree level, we will not see the uctuations around f = 0, which
would (in string loops) distinguish the e8  e8 and spin(32)/z2 heterotic strings. thus, the two

heterotic string theories, compactied on an ale space without small instantons, have the same

moduli space. note that in the case of spin(32)/z2, since we have taken the gauge eld to be

trivial, we are considering the case of a gauge bundle with vector structure.

3

at innity (on r3), and do not modify the asymptotic behavior of m as found in step (2)

above. four-dimensional hyper-kahler manifolds with these properties have been analyzed

[16,17]. such an m either has a singularity that would be dicult to interpret in conformal
eld theory, or is a unique, smooth, complete hyper-kahler four-manifold mah described
in [17]. we thus argue that m = mah. here mah is the space that was identied by
atiyah and hitchin as the moduli space of bps dimonopoles in three dimensions.

in sections 2.3 and 2.4, we give the best arguments we can for why the moduli space

should be nonsingular. among other things, we argue by a simple linear sigma model

construction that the (0, 2) conformal eld theory describing the heterotic string on a

calabi-yau manifold y of any complex dimension n never develops a singularity when y

develops an isolated hypersurface singularity near which the gauge elds are trivial.

steps (1) to (3) above are in precise parallel with similar steps that were used in

the determination of the moduli space of vacua for minimal su (2) supersymmetric gauge

theory in three dimensions with eight supercharges [18]. (minimal means that we consider

the theory of the su (2) vector multiplet only, without additional charged elds.) in that

case (after dualizing the photon to convert the vector multiplet that parametrizes the

coulomb branch of the theory to a hypermultiplet), we have the following statements, in
close parallel to the above: (1) the classical moduli space of vacua is (r3  s1)/z2; (2)
there is a one-loop correction that replaces the product r3  s1 by a twisted ber bundle;
(3) there are instanton corrections that turn the moduli space into mah.

though i do not understand the reason for this analogy, the analogy does suggest a

generalization of our result to other a-d-e singularities. consider the heterotic string at

a singularity of type g without small instantons, where g is a group of a, d, or e type.

the conjecture is that the hypermultiplet moduli space for the heterotic string near such

a singularity is the moduli space of vacua of a minimal supersymmetric gauge theory in

three dimensions with eight supercharges and gauge group g.

2. analysis of the moduli space

as was explained in the introduction, we will here analyze the behavior of the heterotic

string at an a1 singularity without small instantons. an a1 singularity is simply a quotient
singularity of the form r4/z2, where the generator of z2 acts on r4 by multiplication by
1. the analysis will come in the three stages described in the introduction: (1) super-
gravity; (2) incorporation of an o() correction; (3) exact description using worldsheet

instantons.

4

2.1. supergravity analysis

in string theory, when one divides r4 by z2 to form the orbifold r4/z2, one must pick

the sign of the action of z2 on fermions. either choice leaves half of the supersymmetry

unbroken and determines a distinguished orientation on r4/z2. with this distinguished

orientation, r4/z2 is a at hyper-kahler manifold with an isolated orbifold singularity.

as a hyper-kahler manifold, x has a two-sphere of complex structures. if i, j, and k are

where w2

the quaternion generators on r4, then the general complex structure is w1i + w2j + w3k,
3 = 1. the symmetry group of x = r4/z2 is so(4) = su (2)lsu (2)r
where (with a suitable choice of orientation) i, j, and k are invariant under su (2)l and

2 +w2

1 +w2

transform with spin one under su (2)r. hence a choice of ~w breaks su (2)l  su (2)r to

su (2)l  u (1)r.

if one picks a particular ~w, that is a particular complex structure on x, then one

can blow up the orbifold singularity of x in that complex structure to make a smooth
ale hyper-kahler manifold, the eguchi-hansen space x  [19]. in such a blowup, there is
a projection x   x which is generically one-to-one and is holomorphic in the complex
structure specied by ~w. the blowup of x to make x  is completely determined by the

choice of ~w and the area  of the exceptional divisor produced in the blowup. we can

combine ~w and  to a three-vector ~m whose direction is the unit vector ~w and whose

magnitude determines .

(a convenient way to do this is described below.)

~m is a

completely arbitrary element of r3, so at rst sight it seems that the moduli space of

hyper-kahler blowups of x (modulo dieomorphisms that are trivial at innity) is a copy

of r3.

however, the complex structure ~w with respect to which the blowup is made is not
quite uniquely determined. the projection x   x is holomorphic with respect to both the

complex structure determined by ~w, and the opposite (or complex conjugate) complex

structure determined by  ~w. hence, we should identify ~m with  ~m, and the moduli space

of blowups is actually r3/z2.

we can verify this in the following direct way. as originally presented in [19], the

metric of x  reads

with

ds2 = f (r)2dr2 + r2(2

1 + 2

2) + r2g22
3,

g = f 1 =p1  (a/r)4;

5

(2.1)

(2.2)

here 1, 2, and 3 are the left-invariant one-forms on s3 = su (2), and a is a constant
that can be idented with | ~m|. note that the distinguished role of 3 in the formula breaks

the su (2)l  su (2)r symmetry of the su (2) manifold to su (2)l  u (1)r, as expected.

we cam readily generalize (2.1) to a more general blowup in which 3 is replaced by a

more general linear combination of the s. we introduce an arbitrary unit vector ~w and

generalize (2.1) to

ds2 = f (r)2dr2 + r2  3xi=1

i  ( ~w  ~)2! + r2g(r)2( ~w  ~)2.

2

(2.3)

this is invariant under ~w   ~w, so we should consider ~w, and hence also ~m = a ~w, to be

dened only up to sign.

the exceptional divisor s produced in the blowup is the two-sphere at r = a (where
the coecient of 3 in (2.1) vanishes and the s3 collapses to an s2). its area is  = 4a2.

now, let us include the b-eld. this introduces one more real modulus, which is

essentially the period of the b-eld integrated over s:

 =zs

b.

(2.4)

modulo global gauge transformations of the b eld,  is an angular variable, of period
2. at rst sight, then, it seems that the supergravity moduli space of x  is a product
r3/z2 s1, where the rst factor allows for the blowup and the second for the theta angle.
but r3/z2  s1 is not hyper-kahler, so inevitably there is a subtlety here. to make sense
of  as a number, we need an orientation of s. while x  has a natural orientation, s does
not. a choice of complex structure on x  determines a complex structure and hence an
orientation of s, but if we reverse the complex structure of x , the complex structure and

orientation of s will be reversed.

so under ~w   ~w, the orientation of s is reversed and  is mapped to . the

supergravity moduli space of x  is thus

with z2 acting as 1 on both r3 and s1. this carries a natural at hyper-kahler metric,

msu gra =(cid:0)r3  s1(cid:1) /z2,

(2.5)

with two isolated orbifold singularities.

what about the symmetries of msu gra? su (2)l acts trivially on msu gra, since

it is left unbroken by the blowup, regardless of the choice of ~w, and hence acts trivially

6

on ~w. but su (2)r acts on msu gra = (r3  s1)/z2 as the group of rotations of r3. it
rotates the complex structures of msu gra just as it did to the original orbifold x. the
double cover r3  s1 also has a u (1) symmetry, which we will call u (1)a, that rotates the
s1 factor, adding a constant to the period of the b-eld. su (2)r, because it originates
in the symmetries of the original orbifold x, is an exact symmetry of the conformal eld

theory moduli space, but u (1)a is broken by worldsheet instantons.

topology

to compute the o() correction to the moduli space in section 2.2, we will need some
information about the topology of x , and in more detail about the behavior of x  as ~w

varies.

for xed and nonzero ~w, x  is the cotangent bundle t s of the exceptional divisor s.

this is a standard fact, which we review below. for the present discussion, we will mainly

limit ourselves to the case of a unit blowup, | ~w| = 1; the reason for this is that as long as

the area of the exceptional divisor is nonzero, it can be scaled out and does not aect the

topology. we will also mostly ignore the discrete identication ~w   ~w, and consider ~w

to parametrize a two-sphere w . at the end of the discussion, one can divide by z2.

as ~w varies in w , x  varies as the bers of a six-manifold y that is bered over w .
y is not a simple product x   w . however, if we restrict ourselves to the exceptional

divisor, we do get a simple product s  w . this is ensured by the su (2)l  su (2)r

group action, with su (2)l and su (2)r acting, respectively, by rotations of s and w .
replacing s  w by a nontrivial bration would spoil the su (2)l  su (2)r symmetry.
thus y contains an embedded copy s  w of s2  s2. the normal bundle n to s  w in

y is a real two-plane bundle, which we can alternatively regard as a complex line bundle

r. a complex line bundle is labeled topologically by its rst chern class. in the present
case, the rst chern class of r takes values in h 2(s  w ; z) = z  z, and is determined

by a pair of integers which are the components of the rst chern class along s and w ,
respectively.3 we will show that these integers are (2, 2), a fact that will be used in section
2.2 to determine the o() correction.

to show this, we will use an alternative description of x and x  as a hyper-kahler
, a, a = 1, 2 be a complex hypermultiplet; here a and

quotients [20,21]. we let aaa
a transform as spin 1/2 of su (2)l and su (2)r, respectively, and in addition aaa

has

3 to interpret these components as integers requires orienting s and w . we will not be precise

about the orientations, so some of our statements only hold up to sign.

(2.7)

charge 1 with respect to a u (1) gauge group that we will call u (1)g. the hyper-kahler
moment map condition (for a supersymmetric vacuum after gauging of u (1)g) is

aaa

aab  = ~w  ~a

b  ,

(2.6)

xa

with ~ the pauli -matrices. after imposing this condition and dividing by u (1)g, one
gets for ~w = 0 the orbifold x = r4/z2, and for ~w 6= 0 the resolution x .

let explicitly aaa

= uaa1 + vaa2. the hyper-kahler moment map equation is

in more detail

for example, suppose w1 = w2 = 0, w3 = 1. if we set va = 0 and divide by u (1)g, we
get a copy of cp1 which is the exceptional divisor s. relaxing the condition va = 0, the

equationpa uava = 0 shows that v is a cotangent vector to s = cp1, so that x  is the

cotangent bundle of s, as mentioned earlier.

now we want to describe the normal bundle n , or equivalently the complex line
bundle r. since r is a homogeneous (su (2)l  su (2)r-invariant) line bundle over the
homogeneous space s  w , it can be uniquely determined by describing the group action.
picking a point p (such as the point where w1, w2, and u2 all vanish) in s  w , su (2)l 
su (2)r is broken down to u (1)l  u (1)r. u (1)l  u (1)r acts on the ber of l at p with
some charges, say (n, m), and these are the components of the rst chern class. we will

now show that the charges are (2, 2).

in fact, u (1)l is the symmetry under which u1 and v1 have charge 1 and u2 and v2
have charge 1, while u (1)r is the symmetry that assigns charge 1 to ua and 1 to va.
the u (1)g-invariant coordinate on the ber of l over p is q = u1v2, which has charge 2
for both u (1)l and u (1)r, as promised.

to conclude, we will tie up a detail. using the description in (2.6), the identication

~w   ~w is not very evident. this identication arises because the transformation  :
aaa
abb  maps ~w   ~w, so resolutions of the singularity with equal and
opposite ~w are equivalent by the action of  . moreover (after imposing (2.6) and dividing

 abab 

by u (1)g),  acts trivially for |a|  . the last condition is important, because in
describing the moduli of x , we classify the resolutions up to dieomorphisms that are
trivial near innity; all of the deformations with the same | ~w| are in fact equivalent by an

su (2)r rotation which acts nontrivially at innity.

8

2.2. the o() correction

in this subsection, we carry out the second step in analyzing the heterotic string moduli

space on the ale space without small instantons. this is to analyze the corrections to

the moduli space coming from worldsheet perturbation theory. we will nd that the
perturbative correction to the metric is completely determined by an o() term that can

be described in terms of topology.

the supergravity moduli space msu gra = (r3  s1)/z2 that we found in (2.5) is an
s1 bundle over w = r3/z2, where the bration is described by forgetting . this bration
is at: it is trivial if lifted to r3 (since the double cover of msu gra is a product r3  s1).
for type ii superstrings, something like this is the complete answer to all orders in :

the b-eld periods take values in a torus bundle (or a circle bundle when there is only one

period, as in the case that we are studying) that is at, with discrete monodromies (which

are associated with the mapping class group and singularities). for the heterotic string,

however, the b-eld periods take values in a circle or torus bundle t that is not at. (in

addition, as we will see, the bration structure breaks down near certain singularities.)

note that a circle bundle v is closely related to a complex line bundle v ; v is the
bundle of unit vectors in v . we will write c1(v) as an abbreviation for c1(v ). a torus
bundle t is similarly related to a bundle whose ber is cr, with r the rank of the torus.

here are two related approaches to analyzing the torus bundle t :

(1) for type ii, the eld strength of b is h = db, and the bianchi identity reads

dh = 0.

(2.8)

for the heterotic strings, there are additional chern-simons terms in the denition of h,

and the bianchi identity reads dh = (trf  r  trr  r)/4, where f and r are the

yang-mills and riemann curvature two-forms. in the present paper, we set f = 0, so the

bianchi identity (after dividing by 2 for convenience since h/2 has integral periods) is

d(cid:18) h
2(cid:19) = 

1
82 tr r  r.

(2.9)

the right hand side comes from an o() correction in the worldsheet theory (though we
have set  = 1/2 in writing the formula). for a given target space x  of the heterotic

string, (2.9) has solutions (or the model would be altogether inconsistent). now suppose
that x  varies in its moduli space. if there exists a smoothly varying solution h0 of (2.9),

9

then one can set h = h0 + db , where b  is an ordinary two-form gauge eld (whose

eld strength, for example, obeys conventional dirac quantization); by taking the periods
of b  as coordinates, this would trivialize t . the obstruction to trivializing t is thus the

obstruction to picking a smoothly varying h0. this gives us a framework for describing

t ; if the b-eld has only one periodrs b, so t is a circle bundle, then

zw

c1(t ) =zsw(cid:18)

1

82 tr r  r(cid:19)

(2.10)

for any two-cycle w in the moduli space. 4 this formula completely determines c1(t )

modulo torsion. in the present case there is only one relevant two-cycle and no possibility

of torsion. there is a natural parallel transport of h0 that comes by asking that its change
(when the metric of x  and hence the right hand side of (2.9) varies) be as small as possible;

in going around a loop in moduli space, h0 does not come back to itself, which is why t

is not at. obviously, if t were at, then the left hand side of (2.10) would vanish.

(2) a related and more precise approach (which, for example, could be used in a more

complicated situation to determine the torsion in c1(t )) is as follows. suppose that we

want to study the period of b integrated over a two-cycle s in spacetime. one factor in

the worldsheet path integral is the coupling exp(irs b) to the b-eld; another factor is

the pfaan pf(d) of the worldsheet dirac operator d. the product

exp(izs

b)  pf(d)

(2.11)

must be well-dened. the pfaan pf(d) takes values in a pfaan line bundle l.

hence, exp(irs b) must be a section of l1. so the periodrs b of the b-eld does not

take values in r/2z but in a circle bundle t which is the bundle of unit vectors in l1.

(this description of t , which is discussed in more detail in [15], can be reduced to the

previous one by using the quillen formula for the curvature of pf(d).)

in our problem of strings on the ale space x , the moduli space of hyper-kahler
metrics is r3/z2. at the origin in r3/z2, x  develops a singularity and the  expansion

breaks down, as do the denition and interpretation of the b-eld period. hence, in
analyzing the o() correction, we will work away from the origin in r3/z2. as in the

discussion at the end of section 2.1, this means for topological purposes that we can replace

4 we are over-simplifying a bit. in general, in the above formula, s varies with w , and s  w

must be replaced by the total space of a ber bundle, with ber s and base w .

10

r3/z2 with the unit sphere w dened by | ~w| = 1; w should be divided by z2 at the end

of the discussion.

in the particular case that we are looking at, the b-eld has only one period, namely

 =rs b with s the exceptional divisor. this period takes values in a circle bundle t over

w ; we wish to compute the rst chern class of t . we will do this using the approaches

(1) and (2) above:

(1) the characteristic class trr  r/82 that appears in the bianchi identity (2.9)

is p1/2, where p1 is the rst pontryagin class. as in section 2.1, let y be the six-manifold
bered over w with ber x  (the ber over w  w being x  with moduli determined by

~w). (2.10) amounts to

zw

c1(t ) = 

1

2zsw

p1(t x ),

(2.12)

with t x  the tangent bundle of x . (it would not matter if we used the tangent bundle

of y instead.) in section 2.1, we showed that y is bered over s  w with normal bundle

a two-plane bundle n or equivalently a complex line bundle r. because y is contractible
to s  w , the class p1(t x )/2 is a pullback from s  w . to evaluate it, we note that
t x  restricted to s  w is t s  n (where t s is the tangent bundle of s). as t s is
stably trivial, it does not contribute to p1(t x ), which hence receives a contribution only

from n . in general, one has for any real vector bundle q, p1(q) =pi x2

i , where the xi are
the roots of the chern polynomial. for q a two-plane bundle n that is associated with a

complex line bundle r, there is only one root, which is c1(r). we computed this in section
2.1 to be 2[s] + 2[w ], where the intersection numbers are [s]2 = [w ]2 = 0, [s]  [w ] = 1.

so rsw p1/2 = (1/2)rsw c1(r)2 = (1/2)(2[s] + 2[w ])2 = 4. the rst chern

class of the line bundle t over w is thus 4.

(2) for the second approach, we take s in (2.11) to be the exceptional divisor, and we

must identify the pfaan line bundle l as a line bundle over w . w is a two-sphere that is

a homogeneous space for su (2)r, and a given point w  w is invariant under a subgroup

u (1)r of su (2)r. the rst chern class of l is simply the charge (or the eigenvalue of

the generator) with which u (1)r acts on the ber of l over w. but this ber is simply the

top exterior power of the space of zero modes of the worldsheet fermions of the heterotic

string, with worldsheet s. so the charge of the ber is the sum of the charges of the

zero modes. the heterotic string worldsheet fermions are left-moving gauge fermions ,

which in our problem have no zero modes since we have taken the gauge elds to vanish,

and right-moving spacetime fermions , which are spinors on s with values in the tangent

11

bundle to x . the only modes of  that matter for computing the u (1)r action on the
ber of l are the modes that transform nontrivially under u (1)r; these are the modes
that are sections of the normal bundle n (to s in x ). as we explained in section 2.1,

n is the cotangent bundle to s, rotated with charge 2 by u (1)r. holomorphically, the
spin bundle of s is the holomorphic bundle o(1). n is the real cotangent bundle of s;
its complexication splits holomorphically as o(2)2  o(2)2, where the exponent is the
u (1)r charge. tensoring this with the spin bundle o(1), it follows that spinors on s
with values in n are the sum of o(3)2, with no zero modes, and o(1)2, with two zero

modes. since these two zero modes each have charge 2, the total u (1) charge of the zero

modes is 2 + 2 = 4. the rst chern class of l is hence 4, and so the inverse bundle t , of

which the b-eld period is a section, has rst chern class 4.

the metric

the reader may be perplexed: our goal was to compute the string perturbation theory

corrections to the metric on the moduli space m, and instead we have computed the rst

chern class of a line bundle.

there is, however, a simple relation between the two questions. as noted in section

2.1, the supergravity moduli space, before dividing by the discrete symmetry  , has a

u (1)a symmetry that rotates the period of b by    + c for any angle c. this is
also a symmetry of the  expansion, since the zero mode of b decouples in sigma model
perturbation theory. the metric on m computed in sigma model perturbation theory

therefore has this u (1) symmetry. it also, of course, has su (2)r symmetry, induced from

the geometric symmetries of x that are broken by the blowup. it acts with generic orbits

three-dimensional, since the rst chern class at innity is nonzero. (if indeed su (2)r

acted only on the base and not the ber of the bration at innity, then the su (2)r orbits

would give a trivialization of that bration.)

hyper-kahler metrics in four dimensions with this kind of su (2)  u (1) symmetry

have been classied [17] and are completely determined by the topology at innity. such

metrics are constructed from the euclidean taub-nut space. this space can be obtained

by a hyper-kahler quotient [22] and can be explicitly described by the metric

with  a constant and ~ the dirac monopole potential on r3. this manifold is smooth
and has the topology of r4; the group u (1)a of shifts of  has a xed point at the origin.

12

the xed point means that at the origin, there is no such thing as the period of the
b-eld. at innity, the taub-nut space looks like an s1 bundle over r3 of rst chern
class 1. to get rst chern class n at innity, with n > 0, still over r3, one divides

by    + 2/n, producing a zn orbifold singularity at the origin. (first chern class

+n at innity with n > 0 is obtained from the same metric with opposite orientation of
the ber.) in our case, n = 4, and we want the structure at innity to be that of an s1
bundle over r3/z2, not r3, so we must divide by an additional z2. the generator of this

z2 acts on  by   ; this transformation together with the z4 symmetry    + /2

generates a dihedral group d4, with eight elements. thus, the topology of the spacetime
is r4/d4, and there is an isolated d4 singularity at the origin.

how could this metric be obtained from a detailed calculation, rather than being de-

duced from the topology as we have done? in supergravity, the metric arises by evaluating

the relevant terms in the supergravity action such asr h 2. the correction to the bianchi

identity (2.9) will modify h and therefore modify the evaluation of the metric coming

from this term; this correction is also related by supersymmetry to additional terms in the

action, which will likewise enter in computing explicitly the metric. taking all these eects

into account, one could in principle generate a string perturbation expansion which must

add up to (2.13), since it is determined by the symmetries, the hyper-kahler structure,

and the one-loop eect that determines the topology.

2.3. exact metric

in determining the metric to all nite orders in , we have used a symmetry under

shifts of the b-eld period. this symmetry is violated by worldsheet instantons wrapped

on the exceptional divisor s. moreover [15], such instantons do correct the metric on

m, because there are no worldsheet fermion zero modes except the minimal set required

by supersymmetry. (in fact, the normal bundle to s is o(2), and the gauge bundle is

trivial; eqn. (3.2) of [15] is thus applicable and shows that the instanton contribution is

not zero.) the instanton contributions vanish exponentially fast at innity on m (since
they are proportional to exp(a/2) with a the area of s). so we want a hyper-kahler

metric that has su (2)r symmetry, rotating the complex structures, and is exponentially

close to (2.13) at innity.

four-dimensional hyper-kahler metrics with such an su (2)r symmetry and no u (1)a

symmetry have been classied in [17]. a smooth metric of this type exists if and only if the

rst chern class at innity is 4 or 2 (or +4 or +2 if one takes the opposite orientation

13

on the ber, which corresponds to starting with the opposite hyper-kahler structure on
(r3  s1)/z2). the smooth manifold with rst chern class 4 is often called the atiyah-
hitchin space mah; it is the moduli space of bps dimonopoles on r3. the fundamental
group of mah is z2; it therefore has a double cover, which is the smooth manifold with
rst chern class at innity 2.

the fact that the rst chern class at innity that we computed (namely 4) corre-

sponds to one of the values leading to a smooth manifold suggests that the moduli space

we want is in fact mah. can we argue a priori that m should be smooth?

in the introduction, we argued that near an orbifold singularity without small instan-

tons, the eective heterotic string coupling (if small at innity) is uniformly small, so that

nonperturbative eects should not arise. for example, this means that m should not have

singularities interpreted in terms of nonperturbative massless particles or a non-trivial in-

frared cft. any singularity in m must make sense from the point of view of conformal

eld theory.

conformal eld theory corresponds to the tree approximation to string theory, so this

means that any singularity in m should have an interpretation in the tree approximation

to a weakly coupled classical eld theory. moreover (since we are looking at the heterotic

string on a hyper-kahler four-manifold), this must be a supersymmetric eld theory in six

dimensions. this is very restrictive: in this framework, the only mechanism to generate a

singularity is via un-higgsing of a gauge symmetry. for example, an orbifold singularity

could be interpreted in classical eld theory in terms of restoration of a discrete gauge

symmetry. a z2 orbifold singularity can likewise be interpreted in terms of un-higgsing

of a u (1) gauge symmetry as in the hyper-kahler quotient considered in (2.6), or in terms

of un-higgsing of an su (2) symmetry using a construction discussed in [23].

thus, the orbifold singularities of the supergravity moduli space msu gra = (r3 
s1)/z2 could be interpreted in classical supersymmetric eld theory. string perturbation

theory corrects this to a moduli space m with a metric given in (2.13). now, instead of

two a1 singularities, there is a single d4 singularity. again, this could be interpreted in

terms of classical eld theory in terms of restoration of either a discrete gauge symmetry

(the dihedral symmetry d4) or a continuous gauge symmetry (the gauge symmetry used

[20,21] in interpreting the d4 singularity as a hyper-kahler quotient).

however, since the worldsheet instanton corrections to the metric are nonzero, this

is not an option for the description of the moduli space. the conformal eld theory

moduli space m has the su (2)r symmetry with three-dimensional orbits, but no u (1)a

14

symmetry. we can now use the analysis in chapter 9 of [17]. hyper-kahler metrics with

the asymptotic behavior we want and no u (1)a symmetry correspond to trajectories that

ow to the point labeled q in diagram 4 of that chapter and do not lie on the line qb.

it is shown in [17] that hyper-kahler manifolds obtained this way are either mah or its
double cover, or have a singularity in real codimension one where the trajectory originates

at b. such a real codimension one singularity cannot arise from a hyper-kahler quotient,

and so could not be interpreted in weakly coupled supersymmetric eld theory. given

this, the arguments in the introduction plus the nonvanishing of the instanton corrections

imply m = mah.

2.4. linear sigma model approach

smoothness of the moduli space m presumably means that the conformal eld theory

describing the heterotic string at an a1 singularity, without small instantons, is uniformly

valid for small string coupling constant. this contrasts with the case of a small instanton,

where the eective string coupling diverges and nonperturbative phenomena occur no

matter how weak the bare string coupling might be.

the arguments in the introduction suggest that more generally, a singularity in the

metric with no singularity of the gauge eld tends not to cause a breakdown of heterotic

string perturbation theory. we will here give a simple linear sigma model argument that

supports this expectation for a large class of examples. in making the analysis, we will

adopt the proposal in [24,25] according to which a breakdown of conformal eld theory

should be detected by a failure of normalizability when the quantum states spread in a

new direction in eld space.

we consider the heterotic string on an n-dimensional complex hypersurface k dened

by an equation

f (1, 2, . . . , n+1) = 0

in n + 1 complex variables 1, 2, . . . , n+1. k is smooth if the equations

0 = f =

f
i

(2.14)

(2.15)

have no common solution. k can be regarded as a noncompact calabi-yau manifold. we

want to consider what happens when, by varying a parameter, a singularity develops. for

example, we may take

f =

n+1xi=1

2

i + ,

15

(2.16)

with a parameter .

in this case, the hypersurface k develops a conifold singularity

as   0. in studying the perturbative heterotic string near a singularity in k, we will

assume that the gauge bundle is trivial. this means that the left-moving gauge fermions

of the heterotic string will be free elds, decoupled from the (0, 2) or (0, 4) sigma model

that will describe the motion of strings on k.

indeed, if n > 2, the sigma model with target k is a (0, 2) model, while for n = 2, it

is a (0, 4) model. related to this, if n > 2, the only moduli of such a singularity are the

complex structure moduli that are present in k. for n = 2, because there are collapsing

two-spheres at the singularity, there are additional kahler and b-eld moduli. despite

this dierence, i claim that the sigma model with target space k is well-behaved as k

develops a singularity for any value of n. i will rst argue this for generic n using (0, 2)

linear sigma models, and then (after an excursion into (2, 2) models) consider more closely

the case of n = 2 using a (0, 4) linear sigma model. the (0, 4) model is important for

getting a convincing understanding of the n = 2 case, because for n = 2, the (0, 2) linear

sigma model does not exhibit all of the moduli.

to construct a linear sigma model that should ow in the infrared to the (0, 2) su-

perconformal eld theory with target space k, we work in (0, 2) superspace (described
2
more fully in [26]) with supercovariant derivatives d+, d+ obeying d2
+ = 0,
{d+, d+} = +. to get (0, 2) supersymmetry, d+ and d+ both have a spinor index
of the same chirality, as do the fermionic coordinates +, 

of superspace. we intro-

+ = d

+

duce bosonic chiral superelds 1, . . . , n+1, obeying d+i = 0. they can be expanded
i = i + i+
i complex bosonic and fermionic elds, respectively;

is of denite chirality. the conventional kinetic energy for these elds is contained in
i
the superspace expression

i + . . ., with i and 

lkin =z d2d2+xi

ii.

(2.17)

in addition, we introduce a fermionic chiral supereld + = + + +p + . . ., where + is
a complex fermion of opposite chirality to 
i , and p is a complex bosonic auxiliary eld.
the kinetic energy for +, together with a |p|2 term, comes from

laux =z d2d2+

+

+.

these multiplets are coupled by a superpotential interaction

lsuper =z d2d++f (i) + c.c.

16

(2.18)

(2.19)

note that the integrand must be a chiral supereld in order for (2.19) to be supersymmetric;

that is why f must be holomorphic. we will assume moreover that f is a polynomial, so

that the superrenormalizable quantum eld theory we are constructing exists rigorously,

and the only issue is what it ows to in the infrared. after performing the  integral,

lsuper gives an interaction pf (i) (plus a yukawa coupling that gives mass to + together
with a -dependent linear combination of the 

i ). after integrating out the auxiliary eld

p using the |p|2 term from laux, we get then an ordinary potential

v = |f (i)|2.

(2.20)

the space of classical zeroes of v is thus the hypersurface k dened by f = 0. if

k is smooth, this model presumably ows to a (0, 2) superconformal eld theory with

that target. even if k is not smooth, as long as its singularities are isolated, the possible

occurrence of a singularity in k should not aect the well-denedness of this conformal

eld theory. for example, in this theory, since f (being a polynomial) grows if one is far

from k, the wave functions decay rapidly when far away from k, whether k is singular or

not. the only unnormalizability of the quantum states comes from the noncompactness of

k, and assuming the singular set of k is compact (by holomorphy this is so precisely if the

singularities of k are isolated) this unnormalizability is not aected by the singularities.

when k develops a singularity, the conformal eld theory becomes strongly coupled and

dicult to analyze near the singularity, but nonetheless should continue to be well-behaved.

(2, 2) models

since the above arguments may appear to be based on almost nothing, let us now

show that in fact a similar analysis with a singularity in the gauge bundle as well as in the

geometry gives a dierent result. we will consider the special case of embedding the spin

connection in the gauge group, which ensures that the gauge bundle becomes singular

when the geometry does. to study this case, we must consider (2, 2) superconformal eld

theories, and formulate our linear sigma models in (2, 2) superspace. this was done for the

conifold in [24], but here we will follow a more elementary and direct route. we introduce

bosonic chiral superelds i = i + . . . and p = p + . . . and a superpotential

w = pf (i).

17

(2.21)

(2.22)

a classical zero of v with p 6= 0 must have f = df = 0. hence, if the hypersurface k is

smooth, all zero energy states have p = 0. the space of such states is the hypersurface
k obtained by setting f = 0 in cn+1. thus, for smooth k, the model should ow in

the infrared to a sigma model with target space k. so far this discussion is rather like

the (0, 2) case. but now suppose that k is singular. setting the i to a singular point

of k, that is a solution of (2.15), we now get a new branch of the moduli space of vacua

by taking p 6= 0. the new branch is not compact, since p can be arbitrarily big. the

ability of quantum states to spread on this new branch should be expected to lead to a

breakdown of the conformal eld theory. indeed, in the case of the conifold (for n = 3), the

familiar pole in yukawa couplings has been computed [27] from the leaking of quantum

states onto the new branch. this computation was actually done in a linear sigma model

realization of the conifold dierent from what we have given above; the fact that dierent

linear sigma model formulations show the occurrence of a new branch at the singularity

encourages us to believe that this is an intrinsic phenomenon of the singularity and not an

artifact of a particular linear sigma model formulation.

complex dimension two

to understand what happens in complex dimension two, we need, for reasons ex-

plained above, linear sigma models with (0, 4) supersymmetry. these can be obtained

by considering a type i d-string near an a-d-e singularity (those are the only relevant

singularities for n = 2). a type ii d-string near an a-d-e singularity is described by a

linear sigma model with (4, 4) supersymmetry, as constructed in [21]. by setting to zero

some elds in the (4, 4) model, we can obtain the desired (0, 4) model.

the (4, 4) models contain hypermultiplets with bosonic elds h and fermionic elds

+,  (the subscript indicating the two-dimensional chirality); they also contain vector
multiplets with gauge elds a, scalars , fermions , and auxiliary elds ~d. on the
higgs branch, h has a vacuum expectation value; on the coulomb branch,  has a vac-

uum expectation value. a singularity arises when the higgs branch meets the coulomb

branch. the parameters controlling the occurrence of the singularity are fayet-iliopoulos

(fi) constants ~r that can be added to the hyper-kahler moment map ~(h), plus theta

18

angles for the gauge elds. (for the a1 singularity, ~(h) is written explicitly on the left

hand side of (2.6), and the fi constants appear on the right.)

these models arise by dimensional reduction from six-dimensional supersymmetric

models that have an r-symmetry group su (2)r; the dimensional reduction to two di-

mensions produces an additional r-symmetry group so(4) = su (2)+  su (2). under

su (2)+  su (2)  su (2)r, + transforms as (1/2, 0, 1/2),  as (0, 1/2, 1/2), and 

as (1/2, 1/2, 0). (as a quick check, note that these transformations are compatible with

the existence of a + yukawa coupling.) to project to a (0, 4) model, one requires all
elds to be invariant under a transformation (1)fl which is simply the central element

1 of su (2). this projection sets  = 0, so there is in the (0, 4) model no coulomb

branch, and hence no singularity of the conformal eld theory even when the target space

develops an a-d-e singularity.

to describe in more detail what does happen, let us see what elds survive the pro-

jection to (0, 4). the part of the hypermultiplet that survives are the bosons h and

the right-moving fermions +; these make up what one might call a (0, 4) hypermulti-

plet. as for the vector multiplet, before the projection, apart from , its components
(a, +, , ~d) transform as (0, 0, 0), (0, 1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (0, 0, 1), respectively.
hence the survivors are a, , and ~d; in particular, the only propagating modes in the
(0, 4) vector multiplet are left-moving fermions . the auxiliary elds ~d survive the
projection to a (0, 4) model. after integrating them out, one gets an ordinary potential
v (h) = (~(h)  ~r)2. for generic ~r, the minima of v (h) are a smooth resolution x  of
the a-d-e singularity. for ~r  0, x  becomes a singular ale space x; because the

singularity of x is isolated, there is no failure of compactness of the eld space. hence,

one expects the conformal eld theory to be strongly coupled but not to break down. this

contrasts with the corresponding (4, 4) model, where a coulomb branch appears for ~r  0

and the conformal eld theory breaks down.

comparison with bundle singularities

the opposite of the situation we have just looked at is a singularity in the gauge

bundle on a smooth manifold. it has been argued ([27], section 5.1) that in a large class of

linear sigma models, a gauge singularity on a smooth manifold does result in a breakdown

of conformal eld theory. for a particular case (in complex dimension three) a proposal

has been made concerning the nature of the resulting nonperturbative physics [28]. these

results generalize the small instanton story for n = 2. when conformal eld theory does

19

break down because of a singularity, the nature of the breakdown is not fully understood.

in the known cases, including the small instanton [8], the type ii a-d-e singularities [29],

and several cases treated recently [30,31], the breakdown of conformal eld theory can

apparently be described by the appearance, after suitable change of variables, of a linear

dilaton eld with a blowup of the string coupling constant at one end. a framework for

understanding this has been proposed [32].

appendix . structure of (0, 2) moduli space

let y be a calabi-yau threefold; keep its complex structure xed in this discussion.

the remaining moduli of a (0, 2) supersymmetric model with target y are the gauge bundle

moduli and the kahler moduli. the denition of a holomorphic vector bundle depends

only on the complex structure and not the kahler metric. one might therefore think that

in the supergravity approximation, the (0, 2) moduli space would be a product mg  mk
of a gauge bundle moduli space mg and a kahler moduli space mk . this is assumed

in section 5.2 of [27], but is inaccurate for several reasons. one reason is that mg is the

moduli space of stable bundles, and the condition for stability jumps as the kahler metric

varies. as a result, mg undergoes birational transformations as one moves about in mk,

a phenomenon explored in [33]. there is a reciprocal eect which, by itself, would cause

mk to be bered over mg. indeed, given that the b-eld periods are part of the kahler

multiplets, a non-trivial bration of mk over mg follows from the fact developed in [15]

and used in section 2.2 above: the b-eld periods take values in a circle bundle, not just

in u (1). (the nontrivial bration of the b-eld periods over mg comes from the tr f  f

term in the bianchi identity for b; this term is present in the minimal supergravity.)

regrettably, this invalidates the attempt in section 5.2 of [27] to argue conformal

invariance of (0,2) models directly from nonlinear sigma models. (the rest of the paper

is based on linear sigma models.) note that the formula for the instanton contribution to

the superpotential given in [15] varies holomorphically with the parameters, showing that

the nontrivial bration invalidates the claims in section 5.2 of [27].
