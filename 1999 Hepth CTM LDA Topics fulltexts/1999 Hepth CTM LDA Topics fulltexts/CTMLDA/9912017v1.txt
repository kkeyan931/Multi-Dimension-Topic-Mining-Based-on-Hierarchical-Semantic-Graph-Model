abstract

we nd a new d-parameter family of ultra-local boundary poisson brackets that satisfy
the jacobi identity. the two already known cases (hep-th/9305133, hep-th/9806249 and hep-
th/9901112) of ultra-local boundary poisson brackets are included in this new continuous family
as special cases.

introduction

we have seen an increasing number of theories during the last few years where boundaries or
topological defects play a central role. open strings ending on d-branes are one of the more recent
examples and surface terms in gravity is another.

typically a physical system has to fulll extra constraints at a boundary. there can be sound
physical motives for imposing these constraints (for instance local conservation of a quantity), but
they can also appear for more ad hoc reasons.

the work of [1, 2] use a generalized notion of functional dierentiability, that led to two new
boundary poisson brackets. they generalize the poisson bracket of lewis, marsden, mongomery
and ratiu [4]. it would be worthwhile to go back and re-examine various physical systems in this
framework. it might lead to new ways of imposing (or not imposing!) boundary conditions and
solving the system.

in this letter we shall stay in a general canonical formalism, and develop the poisson brackets wrt.
this extended notion of functional dierentiability.

2 review of boundary poisson brackets

consider a d + 1 dimensional space-time   ir, where space  is a region of ird, with a spatial
boundary . consider a phase space of (bosonic) coordinate and momenta eld variables a(x, t),
a = 1, . . . , 2n . time plays no role in the following, so we shall suppress t in our formulae. we
denote the non-degenerate symplectic structure by ab, which we for simplicity take to be ultra-
local and constant.

our building blocks for the boundary poisson bracket[1, 2, 3] are the tower of higher euler-lagrange
derivatives

f

a(k)(x)

,

(2.1)

(2.2)

of a functional f . (see for instance olver [5, p.365].) they have the property that

f = z

ddx



xk=0

k(cid:20)

f

a(k)(x)

a(x)(cid:21)

for arbitrary innitesimal variations of the elds a(x)  a(x) + a(x). the case k = 0 corre-
sponds to the usual euler-lagrange derivative. note, that the terms with k 6= 0, by the divergence
theorem, can be recast into an integral over the boundary . clearly our ability to probe the
higher derivatives diminishes as we constrain the dynamical elds a(x) with more boundary con-
ditions. here we want to investigate the maximal eect of the boundary terms, and hence we shall
not impose any boundary conditions. (needless to say that if boundary conditions at a later stage
become necessary, for instance during quantization, this will cause no inconsistency, because it just
restricts the number of eld congurations.)

with this in mind, it is easy to see that the bulk poisson bracket

{f, g}(0)  z

ddx

f

a(0)(x)

ab

g

b(0)(x)

(2.3)

built out of the usual euler-lagrange derivatives does not generically satisfy the jacobi identity:
there can be a non-zero total derivative term left over. it is natural to ask if it is possible to modify
the bulk poisson bracket (2.3) with a boundary term such that the jacobi identity is restored
identically.

3 a d-parameter family of boundary brackets

we limit ourselves to the following ultra-local ansatz for the full boundary poisson bracket

{f, g} =



xk,=0

ckz

ddx k+(cid:20)

f

a(k)(x)

ab

g

b()(x)(cid:21) ,

(3.1)

where ck is a sequence of constant coecients. the bulk coecient c00  1 by denition. soloviev
[1] found that

is a solution. recently, we found another solution [2]

k,  : ck = 1

ck = min(k,),0 = ( 1 if k = 0 or  = 0

0 otherwise .

our main new result is that

ck(s) =

(s)k(s)
(s)k+

=

(k+s)(+s)
(k++s)(s)

=

b(k+s, +s)
b(k++s, s)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

is a solution for arbitrary complex parameter s  ((ic  {})\(in ))d on d copies of the riemann
sphere except for the negative integers s  (in )d, in  {1, 2, 3, . . .}, where some of the coecients
have poles. here (s)n = (s + n)/(s) is the pochhammer symbol in d dimensions.

the two previously found solutions (3.2) and (3.3) correspond to s =  and s = 0, respectively.

x-pointwise poisson bracket

we have assumed that all relevant functionals are of the local form

f = z

ddx f (x) ,

(4.1)

for some function f (x)  f(cid:16)k(x), x(cid:17), that can depend on the dynamical elds a(x) and on

its spatial derivative ka(x) up to a nite order n .

2

the notion of higher functional derivatives, if dened merely from the descriptive property (2.2), is
not unique. we emphasize that we use the canonical choice of the higher euler-lagrange derivatives:

f

a(k)(x)

= ea(k)f (x)  xmk  m

k ! ()mkpa(m)f (x) ,

(4.2)

where pa(m)f (x) denotes the partial derivative of f (x) wrt. ma(x). it is easy to see that they
obey property (2.2). the x-pointwise poisson bracket reads

{f, g}(x) =



xk,=0

ck k+hea(k)f (x) ab eb()g(x)i .

5 fourier transformed bracket

it is convenient to resum the higher derivatives in a series,

pa(q)f 

ea(q)f 





xk=0
xk=0

pa(k)f qk ,

ea(k)f qk = exp(cid:20)



q(cid:21) pa(q) ,

and to introduce the fourier transform

pa(y)f  z ddq eqypa(q)f ,
ea(y)f  z ddq eqyea(q)f = eypa(y)f .

the ansatz (3.1) for the boundary poisson bracket becomes of the form

{f, g} = z ddy ddya ddyb t (y, ya, yb) eyhea(ya)f ab eb(yb)gi

for some kernel function t (y, ya, yb). the d-parameter solution (3.4) can be written

t (y, ya, yb) = z ddq eqy 2 (s, s; s |qya, qyb )

where 2 is a conuent hypergeometric function in two variables (in d dimensions):

2 (, ;  |x, y ) 



xk,=0

where

i = 1, . . . , d : i / (in0)  i = i = i = 0 ,

and where in0  {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.

6 sucient condition for the jacobi identity

to show that a bracket is a poisson bracket, the non-trivial step is to prove the jacobi identity. it
follows in straightforwardly, similar to the derivation given in appendix b of [2], that

z dd y t (y+yb, ya, yb + y) t (y+yc, yc , yd)  (a  d, b  c) = 0

(6.1)

is a sucient condition for the jacobi identity of (5.3). in our case, (5.4) the condition (6.1) holds,
because it is an identity for the 2 function. after a y  q fourier transformation it reads:

z dd y dd q eqyb 2 (s, s; s |qya, q(yb + y) ) eq(y+yc ) 2 (s, s; s |qyc, qyd )

 (a  d, b  c) = 0 ,

s / (in )d .

(6.2)

this identity is the special case s = t, of a more general identity

z dd y dd q eqyb 2 (s, t; 2ts |qya, q(yb + y) ) eq(y+yc ) 2 (s, s; t |qyc, qyd )

 (a  d, b  c) = 0 ,

which is dened for pairs (s, t) satisfying

i = 1, . . . , d :

ti, 2tisi / (in0)  si = ti = 0 .

a proof of the 2 identity (6.3)

for completeness we provide a proof for the 2 identity (6.3). let us assume that we are given a
pair (s, t) satisfying (6.4). it is enough to give the proof for

ts / (in0)d ,

(a.1)

because once this case is proven, the remaining case would then follow from a continuity argument.
assuming1 (a.1), we can rewrite the 2 functions as

2 (s, t; 2ts |qya, q(yb + y) ) =z dd ya dd qa eqa ya  (s; ts |qaya )  (ts, t |q ya, q(yb + y) ) ,
2 (s, s; t |qyc, qyd ) =z dd yd dd qd eqd yd  (s, ts |qyc, q yd )  (s; ts |qdyd ) .(a.2)

here  is the usual conuent hypergeometric function in one variable (also known as 1f1)

 (;  |x ) 

()k
()k

xk
k!

,

 / (in0)d .

(a.3)



xk=0

1it is rather remarkable that the case s = t, which is the case (6.2) that we ultimately are interested in, is excluded

by this assumption!

4

we have introduced a convenient notation

 (,  |x, y )  2 (, ; + |x, y ) =

b(+k,  +)

b(, )

xk
k!

y
!

,



xk,=0

+ / (in0)d , (a.4)

for a special case of the conuent hypergeometric function 2. we choose the name  because of
its relationship with the euler beta function. of crucial importance is the kummer transformation

ez (,  |x, y ) =  (,  |x+z, y+z ) ,

(a.5)

which can easily be deduced from the integral representation:

 (,  |x, y ) =

1

b(, )z 1

0

du u1(1  u)1exu+y(1u) ,

re(), re() > 0 .

(a.6)

we insert the expressions (a.2) into equation (6.3), then we apply a suitable kummer transforma-
tion on each of the two  functions and nally we do a translation of the integration variables

y
a = ya  yb ,

y
d = yd  yc .

(a.7)

then equation (6.3) becomes

z dd y dd q dd y

a dd qa dd y

d dd qd eqa(y

a+yb)  (s; ts |qaya )

eq y (cid:0)ts, t(cid:12)(cid:12)q y

a, q y(cid:1) (cid:0)s, ts(cid:12)(cid:12)0, q y
d(cid:1)

d+yc )  (s; ts |qdyd )  (a  d, b  c) = 0 .

eqd(y

this is true, because

z dd y dd q eq y (cid:0)ts, t(cid:12)(cid:12)q y

a, q y(cid:1) (cid:0)s, ts(cid:12)(cid:12)0, q y

d(cid:1) = 2(cid:0)ts, ts; 2ts(cid:12)(cid:12)q y

so that the (a  d, b  c) symmetry becomes manifest.
