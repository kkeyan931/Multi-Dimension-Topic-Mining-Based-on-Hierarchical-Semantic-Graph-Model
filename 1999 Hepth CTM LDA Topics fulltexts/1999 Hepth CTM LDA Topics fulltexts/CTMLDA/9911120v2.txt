abstract. using sigma-model approach, we study a class of coset spaces with
torsion which compactify the d = 26 closed bose-string theory. requiring also
that massless chiral fermions arise from the geometry/topology of coset space,
we are left with the unique possibility: it implies d = 14 subcritical dimensions
and certain isometry group.

1. introduction

the common belief now is that an adequate conctruct of toe (theory of everything)
will employ some version of string theory [1]. with impact on 3+1 phenomenology,
various compactications were studied [1,2] in the context of ten dimensional (super)
strings. these latter however are known to result [3], via dimensional reduction
using 16-torus, from the d = 26 bosonic string theory which is thus the only one
preserving the status of unique string theory. no doubt, it is of great importance
to study other (than toroidal) ways of bose-string compactication starting directly
from d = 26. for this purpose, more than a decade ago in [4] we proposed to use
certain compact coset spaces k (of dimension d) with nontrivial torsion for getting
compactications of the form

m 26  m 26d  k d,

(1)

and studied their properties using sigma-model approach (previously applied for
superstring compactications, see e.g., [1, 2, 5]). here, after a sketch of main facts
from [4], we present arguments in favour of denite unique compactication which
xes (i) the number 14 of subcritical dimensions (scds), (ii) gauge group in d = 14
stemming from isometry of compactifying coset space, and provides chiral fermions.

grounds, that implies vanishing of their beta-functions: g
remark that the phenomenon of geometrostasis due to presence of torsion [7] is
crucial in order to guarantee such vanishing (or, the appearance of nontrivial xed
point in the space of g , b , , treated as couplings). these consistency (the
vanishing) relations are also interpreted as the equations for string propagation in
such external elds. to describe a class of consistent coset-space string compacti-
cations, we rst exploit these equations to lowest order, namely [6]

thus, at this order, one searches for the desired solutions among gricci-at spaces,

to be extracted from the variety of coset spaces. also, we have to ensure  = 0.

3. the relevant coset spaces

(y)dy for a coset-space g/h are obtained from the lie-
the vielbeins ea(y) = ea
algebra valued 1-form v (y)  l1(y)dl(y) = ea(y)ia + ei(y)ii in which the gener-
ators ii, i = 1, 2, ..., dim h (or ia, a = 1, 2, ..., dim g/h) generate lie algebra of
the subgroup h (or tangent space of g/h at the unit of lie group g) and satisfy

[ia, ib] = f i

abii + f c

abic,

[ii, ij ] = f k

[ii, ia] = f b

iaib.

(7)

the following main classes of coset spaces are to be mentioned.

(i) group manifolds (with a lie group g) equivalent to (g  g)/g;
(ii) symmetric spaces [typical representatives (trs): n -spheres sn = so(n +1)
so(n )
ab = 0 in (7);

so(n k)so(k) ]. for these, f c

and grassmannians grn,k =

so(n )

(iii) nonsymmetric spaces, splitting into

 isotropy-reducible ones [trs are stiefel manifolds so(n )/so(n  k)],
 isotropy irreducible ones [tr is the berger manifold sp(2)/su (2)].
symmetric spaces (ii) possess no torsion; group manifolds admit torsion, but are
inappropriate since they do not yield [8] chiral fermions. thus, we are left with the
class (iii). but, the -subclass contains coset manifolds with complicated structure
of their spaces of riemannian metrics described by many parameters (moduli).
we restrict ourselves to the case of minimal possible number n = 1 of moduli. note
that moduli space of both symmetric spaces and nonsymmetric isotropy-irreducible
(nsii) ones, is 1-dimensional (homothety of metrics is the relevant parameter).
thus, we choose the -subclass of nsii coset spaces.

these coset spaces were completely described by manturov and wolf [9, 10].

we calculate the metric -function for the case [11] of berger manifold (bm) to
obtain the 1-loop result [4] g(1)
2 2)ab. so, the choice  = 3 ensures
vanishing of the metric -function. also, one can argue for the bm that b
ab = 0 (in
fact, this holds for all coset spaces in table 1). as shown in [4], for the bm there
exists such a connection (such value of , i.e.,  = 33) that ensures  = 0.

similar 1-loop analysis can be done [4] for all other nsii coset spaces.

ab = (13.5  3

as shows table 1, the number 10 of scds as well as the observed number
4, are forbidden. this dictates the necessity of (at least) two separate stages of
compactication, the second one implying presence of certain nonabelian gauge
eld generated by isometry of the rst-stage coset space. however, there is an
alternative - to consider not only simple, but also product-type compactications
(see section 5) of the form k i  k j, k i  k j  k l, and k i  k j  k l  k m, with
factors taken from the table.

4. extension to the two-loop order

there was an extensive study of -functions of these generalized -models to two-
loop order, see [12] and references therein. while there was no renormscheme (rs)
ambiguity, to this order, with absent b-eld, essential rs-ambiguities do appear
 and , obtained in
when b is included. the two-loop expressions for g
[12], depend on the 3 extra parameters f1, p1, p2 characterizing rs-dependence. let
us quote the expression for g(2)

in a particular rs:

straightforward calculation, using (10), for the concrete case of bm k 7
a shows: with
the canonical ( = 1) connection, this coset space cannot provide a solution (i.e.,
no rs exists) of the equation g(2)
 = 0. on the contrary, at certain connections
with  6= 1, even in the scheme f1 = 1 there are solutions (that follows from
calculations involving (10)). like in [5], set  = /r2. besides the trivial solution
 = 0,  = 3, there exists the one for which  is nonzero and 1 >  > 0:

 = 3  ,

 = p2()/p4()

(11)

where  is a small parameter; p2() and p4() are concrete polynomials of 2nd and
4th order in .

from (11) it follows that the 2-loop consistency condition g(2)

 = 0 imposes
concrete relation between the magnitude of torsion and the size of manifold (com-
 =  = 0 for a nsii coset space are
pactication radius). in general, solutions of g
found by solving the system of two equations f (g/h; , ) = 0, h(g/h; , ) = 0,
with denite scalar functions dependent on g/h.

5. product-type compactications

similar analysis can be applied to the case of product spaces. the following table

again, there is no compactication leading to 10 scds. although the case of
4 scds is admissible (d = 22 line in the table), the ve compactifying coset spaces
do not yield chiral fermions: as can be shown, the euler characteristics  = 0
for all the d = 22 coset spaces. thus, we conrm: there must be (at least) two
stages of coset-space compactication of the considered type, to obtain the realistic
4 dimensions with necessary chiral fermion (quark-lepton) families. the unique
candidate for such rst stage of coset-space string compactication, as shows the
table, is nothing but the d = 12 space k 6  k 6 with  = 4, which leads to 14
dimensions and chiral fermions therein.

6. concluding remarks

1) we arrived at the necessity, even using product coset spaces, of at least 2 stages
of compactication. the number 10 of scds is forbidden, from which we conclude
that the considered compactications supply string vacua diering from the known
10d (super)string theories. 2) in fact, h 6= t since dt 6= 0, which follows from
explicit calculation. this dictates to include [5] the lorentz chern-simons 3-form
3l. 3) dilaton eld , playing a special role, requires detailed account of string
loops, see [13]. 4) besides the approximate approach used so far, nonperturbative
construction of a complete solution is certainly needed. a question also arises
whether relevant theory in 14 dimensions, based on this unique compactication
and yet to be constructed, may have some connection to the (bosonic sector of)
recently proposed [14] supersymetric theories in 14 (i.e. 11+3) dimensions.
