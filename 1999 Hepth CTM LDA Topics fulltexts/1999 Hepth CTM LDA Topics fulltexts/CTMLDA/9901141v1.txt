abstract

a quantization condition due to the boundary conditions and the compat-

ication of the light cone space-time coordinate x is identied at the level

of the classical equations for the right-handed fermionic eld in two dimen-

sions. a detailed analysis of the implications of the implementation of this

quantization condition at the quantum level is presented. in the case of the

thirring model one has selection rules on the excitations as a function of the

coupling and in the case of the schwinger model a double integer structure of

the vacuum is derived in the light-cone frame. two dierent quantized chiral

schwinger models are found, one of them without a -vacuum structure. a

generalization of the quantization condition to theories with several fermionic

elds and to higher dimensions is presented.

i. introduction

light-cone quantization (lcq) has been considered recently as an appropriate framework

for a non-perturbative study of relativistic quantum eld theory [13]. the structure of the

vacuum and bound states are examples of ingredients which have a very dierent description

in lcq compared with canonical equal-time quantization. this opens the possibility to get

a new perspective on basic problems like the mechanism of connement in non-abelian gauge

theories by the use of dierent quantization schemes.

from a technical point of view a property of the quantization in the light cone which plays

a crucial role in the present work is that it is naturally dened over a manifold with non-

trivial topology. this can easily be understood from the form of the dispersion relation in

the light-cone k+k  k2

 = m2. in order to be able to get the light-cone energy k from this

expression one considers discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq) [4], i.e., a compactied x

coordinate, l  x  l, leading to discrete non-zero values for the light-cone longitudinal

momentum k+.

the aim of this paper is to explore physical eects whose explanation is related to this

implicit dierence in topology from standard spacetime quantization. we concentrate the

discussion on the simplest system, two-dimensional eld theory, and as a tool the path

integral formulation, which has proved to be very useful at least at a formal level in the

derivation of the fundamental aspects of quantum eld theory, is used. in the next section

we consider quantum mechanics as a toy model to illustrate the general framework of the

discussion. in section 3 we study the thirring model; following the standar representation of

the fermion self-coupling by an auxiliary vector eld we nd a quantization condition on the

integral of the vector eld along a constant x closed line. when the relation between the

auxiliary eld and the fermion current is taken into account and one considers a coupling

g2 such that g2/ is a rational number then the quantization condition translates into a

restriction on the possible values of the number of left-handed fermions, a result obtained

previously [5] by other means. in section 4 similar arguments are applied to the schwinger

2

model and the same quantization condition of the thirring model is obtained with the

auxiliary eld replaced by the gauge eld. in this case there is no algebraic relation between

the vector eld and the fermion density; as a consequence of the quantization condition on

the integral involving the a component one nds a restriction on the asymptotic behavior

at x+ equal to plus or minus innity for the zero mode (x independent component) of the

scalar eld whose derivative with respect to x+ gives the a+ component. this asymptotic

behavior is given in terms of a second integer leading to a double integer structure for the

model. we end up in section 5 with a brief discussion of possible generalizations including

the case with more than one fermionic eld where the quantization condition appears as an

equation por the x path ordered exponential of the integral of an appropriate non-abelian

a eld over the constant x closed line.

ii. a quantum mechanical example

in [5] we showed that for the thirring model in the light cone, the compositer l

is quantized and we argued also that this quantization is due to s1   topology induced

l dx

ll

by the light cone frame. in this section we will show that this quantization rule is quite

natural and it is always present in the quantization of physical systems when periodic or

antiperiodic boundary conditions are assumed.

we illustrate our argument considering the quantum mechanics of a particle with an

action [6]

s = z t

0

dt(cid:20) x2

2

 v  (it + w )(cid:21),

(1)

where v = v (x), w = w (x) and x and  are bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom

respectively. in order to compute z we must x the boundary conditions as follows

x(0) = x(t ),

(0) = (t ),

(2)

(3)

and the partition function after integration over fermionic degrees of freedom becomes

3

z = z dx det[it + w ] er t

0

dt [ 1

2 x2v ].

(4)

the fermionic determinant, as usual, is qn n where n are the eigenvalues of the one-

dimensional dirac operator it + w , namely

[it + w ]n = nn.

equation (5) can be formally integrated out and the exact solution is

(t) = (0) eir t

0


dt


(w (x(t

))n),

z t

0

dt w  nt = 2(n +

1
2

),

and using (3), one nds

 n  z.

(5)

(6)

(7)

on the other hand a quantization condition similar to the ux quantization condition

found in [5] for the thirring model can be derived directly from the equation of motion for

the fermion variable 

(it + w ) = 0,

with the boundary condition (t ) = (0); one nds the condition

z t

0

dt w = 2(m +

1
2

).

(8)

(9)

however (7) and (9) are compatible if and only if n = 0 is one of the eigenvalues of the

dirac operator.

the ux quantization condition gives a restriction on the possible trayectories x(t). the

path integral (4) is decomposed in topological sectors and it is replaced by a sum (over m)

of integrals of the trayectories satisfying (9). in general one can introduce a new parameter

 and an additional weight eim to each sector.

as a simple example that shows explicitly the physical meaning of the ux quantization

condition, let us consider a linear function w = x. in this case (9) becomes

4

z t

0

dt x(t) =

2


(m +

1
2

) .

if one introduces the decomposition in modes

x(t) = x(0) + xn6=0

an sin(

n
t

t) ,

then the ux quantization condition xes the zero mode x(0) in terms of the integer m

x(0) =

2
t

(m +

1
2

) ,

(10)

(11)

(12)

and the sum over topological sectors replaces the integral over the zero mode in the original

path integral (4).

for other choices of w one has similar results, a relation (which will be more involved)

between the zero mode x(0) and the integer m but the physical meaning of the ux quanti-

zation condition (9) is the same.

iii. thirring model

in [5] a rst discussion of the possible implications of a compactied light-like coordi-

nate in the quantization of the thirring model was presented. the study was based on the

identication of a relation of the integration over the auxiliary variable (in the ligth-cone

quantization) r with a quantum mechanical determinant. consistency of the determi-

nant lead to a quantization of the product of the left-handed charge ql and the thirring

coupling g2 and then to the identication of many more excitations than those expected

perturbatively.

in this section a complementary analysis of the quantization of the thirring model com-

patible with the conservation of the vector current is presented. the starting point is the

lagrangian,

lt h = 

l(i+ + a+)l + 

r(i + a)r +

1
2g2 a+a ,

(13)

5

which, eliminating the auxiliary vector eld a, reproduces the lagrangian of the massless

thirring model in ligth cone coordinates x = t  x. in order to identify the consequences

of the boundary conditions on the fermionic eld at x = l we consider the solution of

the equation (i + a)r = 0 for the rigth-handed fermionic eld

r(x+, x) = eir x

0

dya(x+,y)r(x+, 0) .

(14)

the most general boundary conditions compatible with charge conjugation symmetry are

either periodic boundary conditions (p.b.c.) (x+, l) = (x+, l) or antiperiodic boundary

conditions (a.b.c) (x+, l) = (x+, l). in order to have a solution for r compatible

with the boundary conditions, the auxiliary eld component a has to satisfy the restriction

l

z l
z l

l

dxa(x+, x) = 2n for (p.b.c.) ,

dxa(x+, x) = 2(n +

1
2

) for (a.b.c.) .

(15)

on the other hand if one eliminates the auxiliary eld component a+, one nds a =

2g2

ll and the restriction on the auxiliary eld component a can be translated into a

quantization condition on the left-handed chiral charge ql = r l

l dx

ll,

ql =

ql =


g2 n for (p.b.c.) ,

g2 (n +

1
2

) for (a.b.c.) ,

(16)

giving an important information on the non-perturbative spectrum of the model [5].

one can also see how the standard analysis of the model based on bosonization is modied

due to the presence of a compact light-like dimension. in this case one has to consider the

eective fermionic action, f [a], dened by

eif [a+,a] = z ddeir d2x(

l(i++a+)l+

r(i+a)r) ,

(17)

together with the two-dimensional representation of the (auxiliary) vector eld in terms of

the derivatives of two scalar elds. using ligth-cone coordinates, with l  x  l, one

has a+ = +, a =  with

we have made explicit in the expansion the zero mode a(0)
 ,

a(0)

 = z l

l

dxa ,

(18)

(19)

which instead of being a function of x+ becomes a discrete variable as a consequence of the

restriction (15) due to the boundary conditions.

where the regularization arbitrariness has been xed by conservation of the vector current,

is combined with the x-expansion of a one nds

4l z dx+ (n  n) + (n  n) ,

(21)

where 0 = r dx++0 = 0()  0().

the bosonized action s t h

iliary eld of the original lagrangian (13),

s t h

2

2l(cid:19)z dx+n+n



=  1 +
 xn (cid:18) in

(22)

the bosonized action is a sum of terms (non-zero modes) quadratic in the derivatives of two

scalar elds in a two dimensional space with l  x  l plus a contribution of the zero

modes which involves the discrete variable a(0)

 and 0 exclusively. all the implications of

the compactication of the light-like coordinate x are contained in the contribution of the

zero modes.

7

the rst restriction on these zero modes comes from the relation

 g2
 g2

 ! nl = n for (p.b.c.) ,
 ! nl = (n +

1
2

) for (a.b.c.) ,

(23)

which is the quantization condition (16) with ql replaced by the number nl of left-handed

fermions at xed x+.

in the case of antiperiodic boundary conditions g2/ has to be a rational number with

even denominator, g2/ = p/2q and the number of left-handed fermions has to be a multiple

of q, nl = qnl. the integer n which xes the value of the discrete variable a(0)

 (see (15))

is given by

n =   pnl + 1

2

! .

(24)

if one introduces an aditional weight factor ein to each sector, the sum over n can be

easily evaluated using the only term which depends on the zero modes, ei

a quantization condition on 0

a

2 0; one nds

g2! 0 + # = 2m ,

(25)

with integer m.

taking into account that a+ = 2g2

rr and the dependence of r on x given by

the solution (14) for the right-handed eld, one has an auxiliary eld component a+ which

does not depend on x. this means that one can take n = 0 in the mode expansion and

also that 0 can be reexpressed in terms of the original fermionic variables:

0 =

1

2l z l

l

dxz dx+a+ = 2g2z dx+

rr .

then the quantization condition for 0 (25) can be written in the form

p

2 " 

2

 1 +

p

2q! nr# = m ,

8

(26)

(27)

where the integer nr is the number of right-handed fermions for xed x. from this relation

one concludes that /2 has to be also a rational number, 

2 = m

2pq and the number of right-

handed fermions is restricted by the condition that m  p(p + 2q)nr has to be a multiple of

4q.

in the case of periodic boundary conditions one has a trivial solution to the quantization

condition for the zero modes with nl = 0. in this case n = 0 and there is no possibility to

introduce an angle , g2/ can be any real number and the zero modes do not appear in the

action. together with this trivial case there is another solution to the quantization condition

for the zero modes which requires g2/ to be a rational number as in the case of antiperiodic

boundary conditions, g2/ = p/q. in this case one also nds that the number of left-handed

fermions is a multiple of q, nl = qnl and the integer n is in this case n = pnl. the

quantization condition for 0 which results from the sum over n with an aditional weigth

factor ein is

p" 

2

 1 +

p

q! nr# = m .

(28)

in this case one nds that /2 has to be a rational number,

2 = m
right-handed fermions has to be such that m  p2nr is a multiple of q.



pq and the number of

we end up this section emphasizing that the light-cone quantization provides new non-

perturbative information that in the usual spacetime quantization we cannot see. in partic-

ular, the existence of new excitations, the zero modes and the preponderant role played by

the boundary conditions are new ingredients that are absent in the spacetime quantization

iv. schwinger model

the analysis in the previous section of the implications on the quantization of a com-

pactied light-like coordinate for the thirring model can be easily applied to the schwinger

model. the discussion of boundary conditions based on the solution (14) for r and the

expansion of the fermionic eective action (21) can be directly applied with the replace-

ment of the auxiliary vector eld of the thirring model by the dynamical gauge eld in the

9

schwinger model. then, instead of the quadratic term in the auxiliary vector eld of the

thirring model, one has the action of the gauge eld

sg =

1

4e2 z d2x (+a  a+)2 .

using the x-expansion of the gauge eld one has

+a  a+ = xn (cid:18) in

l (cid:19) +(n  n)e

in

l x

.

(29)

(30)

the sum of the fermionic eective action (21) and the gauge eld action (29) leads to the

bosonized action of the schwinger model

1

0 +

l (cid:19)z dx+ (n  n) + (n  n) 

s sm

bos =

a(0)

2
1

4 xn (cid:18)in
l (cid:19)2
4e2 xn (cid:18)in

z dx++ (n  n) + (n  n) .

(31)

together with the zero mode contribution already found in the thirring model, we have

an action for the combination    of the two scalar elds which appear in the two-

dimensional decomposition of the gauge eld. the fact that only one combination of the

two scalars elds appear in the action is a consequence of gauge invariance. from the relative

coecient of the two terms involving n  n one reproduces the well known mass gap of

the model (m2 = e2/).

it is also clear that introducing an external source j one has

 <  >= "i



j

+ +i



j+# eif [a+j]|j=0 = 0

(32)

and

 < i5 >= "i



j

 +i



j+# eif [a+j]|j=0 =

e


(+a  a+) ,

(33)

which reproduces the conservation of the vector current and the anomaly in the axial current.

in the schwinger model there is no analog of the relation found in the thirring model

between the (auxiliary) vector eld and the fermionic variables. then the discussion of the

zero modes is very simple. there is no restriction on the integer n which appears in the

10

quantization condition (15) on the zero mode of the gauge eld component a. on the

other hand if one sums over all posible values of n with an additional relative weight ein

then one has a simple quantization condition for 0

0 +  = 2m .

(34)

it is remarkable that, although one has

z d2xf01 = xn (cid:18)in

l (cid:19)z dx++ (n  n)z dxe

in

l x

= 0 ,

(35)

and then apparently a trivial vacuum structure, the two integer structure of the schwinger

model [7] is easily derived from the contribution of the zero modes (n corresponding to the

zero mode of the a component and m corresponding to the zero mode of a+).

the analysis of the implications of a light-like compact coordinate in the quantization

of a theory with a dynamical vector eld can also be applied to the chiral schwinger model.

there are two dierent models

(36)

in the rst case the equation for the right-handed eld does not involve the vector eld

and there is no quantization condition on the zero modes of the vector eld. the eective

fermionic action is given in this case by

l

f [a+, a] =

1

2 z d2x aa+a 

1
2

a+


+

a+! ,

(37)

where, as a consequence of the chiral coupling, the non-local contribution involves only

the a+ component and the local term has a coecient with a regularization dependent

parameter a due to the lack of gauge invariance [8]. the bosonized action, obtained by

using the decomposition of the vector eld in terms of two scalar elds (18), is

(38)

note that in this case there is no quantization condition on the zero mode of a and -vacua

are absent, a result derived recently [9] in the light-cone hamiltonian formulation.

in the chiral model with an interacting right-handed component one has the same quan-

tization condition (15) on the zero mode of a as in the schwinger model and the bosonized

action is

(39)

the treatment of the zero modes is similar to the gauge invariant case with the quantization

condition for 0 (34) replaced by

a0 +  = 2m .

(40)

v. discussion

we end up by considering the possibility to extend the analysis of the thirring model,

schwinger model and chiral schwinger models presented in this work. one property of all

these models crucial in all the discussion is the absence of a mass term for the fermion

allowing to decouple the two chiral components in the equation for the fermion eld. with

this restriction there are two possible extensions to consider.

the rst generalization is to consider a non-abelian generalization where one has several

fermionic elds instead of a single dirac eld. one will have an equation for the right-

handed fermion eld multiplet with the vector eld a in the abelian cases replaced by a

lie algebra valued vector eld and also a generalization of the boundary condition for the

rigth-handed eld r(x+, l) = e2ir(x+, l) with a matrix  in internal space. one will

have in this case a non-abelian generalization of the quantization condition (15),

pxeir l

l

dxa = e2i ,

12

(41)

where px denotes a path ordering on the light-like coordinate x. the study of the conse-

quences of this quantization condition in a non-abelian generalization of the thirring model

as well as in models with dynamical vector elds deserves further investigation.

a second generalization of the present work is to try to go beyond two space-time di-

mensions. in higher dimensions the solution of the right-handed fermion eld equation can

be expressed also as a path-ordered exponential

r(x+, x, ~x) = pxeir x

0

dy[a(x+,y,~x)i~(~+i ~a(x+,y,~x))]r(x+, 0, ~x) .

(42)

then the choice of periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions for the right-handed

fermionic eld in light-like coordinate x leads to a higher dimensional quantization condi-

tion

pxeir l

l

dy[a(x+,y,~x)i~(~+i ~a(x+,y,~x))]

= 1 ,

(43)

which is more dicult to analyze than the two dimensional case due to the presence of the

additional transverse coordinates ~x. this should be the starting point for a study of the

consequences of a compactied light-like coordinate x on the quantization of a theory with

a massless fermionic eld.
