abstract

a geometric denition for a magnetic charge of abelian monopoles in su (n ) lat-
tice gauge theories with higgs elds is presented. the corresponding local monopole
number dened for almost all eld congurations does not require gauge xing and is
stable against small perturbations. its topological content is that of a 3-cochain. a
detailed prescription for calculating the local monopole number is worked out.

our method generalizes a magnetic charge denition previously invented by phillips

and stone for su (2).

1 introduction

the investigation of the complicated vacuum structure of quantized yang-mills theories re-
quires the use of non-perturbative methods. the lattice regularization is the most convenient
in this respect. among other applications it allows to identify those excitations (monopoles,
instantons, etc.) which are expected to dominate the euclidean path integral at large scales
and to explain important features like chiral symmetry breaking and quark connement in
qcd.

monopoles in which we take interest in this paper form the basis for the dual super-
conductor scenario of connement [1, 2]. according to this scenario the condensation of
(anti-) monopoles causes the color-electric ux to be squeezed into string-like ux tubes
(dual meissner eect). the consequence is a linearly rising potential between static quarks.
whether extended non-abelian t hooft-polyakov-like monopoles (see [3]) or singular
abelian dirac-like monopoles play the major role in the connement phenomenon has not
been settled yet. the majority of investigations concentrates on the latter kind of excitations.
these can be identied by abelian projection after an appropriate gauge has been xed [4].
up till now the maximally abelian gauge was considered to be the most favourable gauge
[5, 6, 7] (for a recent review see e.g.
[8]). for this gauge the resulting u(1) degrees of
freedom as well as the corresponding abelian monopoles were shown to reproduce almost
completely the string tension of the full theory (so-called abelian and monopole dominance,
respectively) [9, 10].

other gauges  dened for instance by diagonalizing gauge observables as parallel trans-
porters along closed paths (e.g. the polyakov loop) which transform like higgs elds in the
adjoint representation  have been studied, too [11]. based on appropriately dened order
parameters according to a construction of frohlich and marchetti [12] the condensation of
abelian monopoles in the connement phase was demonstrated to occur widely independent
of the gauge chosen [13].

but a general gauge independent proof for the validity of the dual superconductor picture

is still missing.

therefore, it would be worthwhile to have a gauge-independent and  at the same time 
geometric lattice denition of the monopole charge. this, in general, requires the existence
of a higgs eld in the adjoint representation. magnetic uxes and the magnetic charge, re-
spectively, can easily be obtained by projecting the non-abelian plaquette variables onto the
local colour direction of the higgs eld. however, the naive discretization does not provide
any geometric meaning of the resulting charge. nevertheless, corresponding investigations
of magnetic uxes have provided useful insight into the phase structure of the 4d su(2)
georgi-glashow model [14].

a rst geometrical denition for the monopole number has been given in [15, 16]. the
lattice gauge eld together with the higgs eld determines local maps from the boundary
of cubes into the coset space su(2)/u(1). the winding numbers of these maps provide
the local integer-valued monopole charge, for each cube, or alternatively speaking, a closed
magnetic current on the dual lattice. in our present work we are going to generalize the
denition to a su(n) gauge-higgs theory. the higgs elds employed are considered to be
cpn 1-valued elds. we shall present all the details necessary for developing a computer
code for the calculation of the winding numbers from the local lattice eld data.

the resulting magnetic charge denition can be employed for explorations of the phase
structure of su(n) gauge-higgs models. but, it might be worthwhile also for the application
to pure su(n) gauge theories, when an auxiliary higgs eld is determined as proposed for
the recently invented laplacian gauge xing [17].

recently, in the context of investigations of the electro-weak phase transition for the
su(2) theory another version of an integer-valued, gauge independent lattice magnetic
charge denition was invented [18]. it remains an interesting task to work out the inter-
relation between the dierent denitions, if there is any.

section 2 will provide the general description and the necessary notations. in section 3
we present the computation of the monopole number. some detailed proofs are shifted into
the appendix. in section 4 we shall draw the conclusions.

2 description of the model and notation

in this work we want to consider a model consisting of an su(n) lattice gauge eld u =
{uij} coupled to a higgs eld  = {i} transforming with respect to the fundamental
representation.
i, j, . . . denote the lattice sites and pairs hiji the corresponding links of a
4-dimensional simplicial lattice. without loss of generality for our construction of the local
monopole number we work with a higgs eld of xed length, kik = 1. in the following we
denote by uijk... = uijujk . . . parallel transporters longer than one link.

as the phase of the vector i  cn will be irrelevant for the monopole charge, it is
sucient to identify the corresponding equivalence class [i]. the latter can be represented
by the n  n projection matrix i = i  
i projecting on the subspace spanned by the
vector i. in this sense the higgs eld takes values in a cpn 1 manifold.

the action of a complex invertible matrix v on elements of cpn 1 will be denoted by
, e.g. v   means the projector v   (v )/kv k2 or the class [v ]. for the lattice
we assume an ordering of the lattice sites and denote the dierent kinds of simplices (sites,
links, triangles, tetrahedra, 4-tetrahedra) by ordered tuples of vertices such as hij . . . ki.
if we consider a site i of a given simplex hij . . . ki as the coordinate origin, a cube chij...ki
parametrized by coordinates 0  sj, . . . , sk  1 can be dened.

3 denition of the local monopole number

our aim in this section is to dene for a given tetrahedron  = hijkli a map x from the
boundary of the 3-dimensional cube chijkli to cpn 1. this map is constructed from the link
and higgs variables at the particular tetrahedron .

since 2(cpn 1) = z, the homotopy class of such a map is represented by an integer
n. this integer will be referred to as the local monopole number at the particular simplex.
it will be shown to have the following properties:

(a) gauge invariance: n is independent of a particular choice of gauge.

(b) local conservation:

3

the assignment  7 n represents a cochain in the sense that

(n)t = xt

()n = 0,

the sign depending on the relative orientation of  in the boundary of a 4-tetrahedron
t . if  is the link dual to  we may equivalently say that m = n is a conserved
(divergence free) magnetic current on the dual lattice.

(c) geometric signicance:

the collection of the xs dene a section of a su(n)/u(n  1)-bundle over the
2-skeleton of the lattice. this section may be regarded as an interpolation of the higgs
eld which is as horizontal as possible with respect to the lattice gauge eld.

the maps x are worked out stepwise for higher simplices.

in order to state their
relevant properties, we need gl(n)-valued parallel transport functions vhij...kli(sj, . . . , sk)
as introduced in [16]. these functions essentially measure to what extent the lattice gauge
eld fails to be at. they are an important ingredient in the construction of su(n) bundles
associated to lattice gauge elds. in our case, the relevant formulae read

vhiji = uij,
vhijki = sjuijk + (1  sj)uik,
vhijkli = sjskuijkl + (1  sj)skuikl + sj(1  sk)uijl + (1  sj)(1  sk)uil,

where 0  sj, sk  1. let us assume for simplicity that the simplex  in question is h01 . . . ki.
then x is assumed to meet the following requirements:

xh0...ki(. . . , sr = 1, . . .) = vh0...ri(s1, . . .)  xhr...ki(sr, . . .),
xh0...ki(. . . , sr = 0, . . .) = xh0.../r...ki(s1, . . . , /sr, . . .),

(1)
(2)

and likewise for all other simplices, with the obvious replacements. it follows from the results
in [16] that such a collection of maps denes a section over the 2-skeleton in a bundle with
principal ber cpn 1. it is also seen that the local winding number of this section at a
tetrahedron  = hijkli is just the winding number of xhijkli : chijkli  cpn 1. let us now
explicitly construct this map.

requirements (1) and (2) suggest to dene the xs inductively for simplices of increasing

dimension. this is done in four steps:

step 0: as the xs essentially interpolate the higgs eld, we set xhii = i for the

lattice sites.

step 1: on the far end sj = 1 of the interval chiji, we must have, by requirement (1)

xhiji(sj = 1) = vhiji  xhji.

on the base sj = 0, xhiji must be xhii, by requirement (2). we thus interpolate geodesically
in cpn 1 for intermediate values of sj.

step 2: on the far sides sj = 1 or sk = 1 of the square chijki, we must have, by

requirement (1)

(a)
(b)

xhijki(sj = 1, sk) = vhiji  xhjki(sk),
xhijki(sj, sk = 1) = vhijki(sj)  xhki.

4

again, on the base sj = sk = 0, xhijki must be xhii, by requirement (2). for intermediate
values we interpolate geodesically from the the far sides to the base.

step 3: in the last step we proceed as before. again, on the far faces sj = 1, sk = 1 or

sl = 1 of the cube chijkli, we must have, by requirement (1)

(i)
(ii)
(iii)

xhijkli(sj = 1, sk, sl) = vhiji  xhjkli(sk, sl),
xhijkli(sj, sk = 1, sl) = vhijki(sj)  xhkli(sl),
xhijkli(sj, sk, sl = 1) = vhijkli(sj, sk)  xhli.

as above, on the base sj = sk = sl = 0, xhijkli = xhii, by requirement (2). unlike in the
previous cases, we cannot interpolate from the the far sides to the base since there might be
an obstruction. nevertheless, we might do so on the boundary of our cube. this completes
our construction. requirements (1) and (2) are more or less obviously satised.

in the next chapter we shall see how the winding number of xhijkli may be calculated.

4 calculation of the monopole number

we have to determine the class of x. take a simplex  = h0123i. the boundary of the
unit cube c with base h0i is the union of six faces c 1

k (k = 1, 2, 3), where

k , c 0

c 0

k = {(s1, s2, s3) :

sk = 0}, c 1

k = {(s1, s2, s3) :

sk = 1}.

the monopole number may be computed as an intersection number [19],

n = x(c) : e,

e denoting the (2n  4)-dimensional space of all projectors perpendicular to some rank
one projector e. the intersection number does not depend on the particular projector e
chosen. to facilitate the calculations, we take it to be 0. the strategy is to compute
the intersection number separately for the six dierent faces of the surface of our cube. as
geodesic interpolation is needed for the denition of x, let us collect some facts about
the geometry of complex projective spaces (see also [20, 21, 22]). two points p, q in the
complex projective space may be joined by a unique shortest geodesic if and only if p q 6= 0.
furthermore, for such points it holds:

lemma 4.1 the unique shortest geodesic between two points p, q intersects e if and only
if re tr[p qe]  0 and im tr[p qe] = 0. moreover, such an arc can intersect e only once.

we shall also need the following fact about triangles.

lemma 4.2 let p, q, r be three points such that there is a unique shortest geodesic between
any two of them. let  be the surface spanned by all geodesics between p and the geodesic

arc dqr. this surface intersects e if and only if the equation im (t) = 0 has a solution

0  t  1 satisfying re (t)  0. here

(t) = t2 tr[qr]1/2tr[erp ] +

(3)

(1  t)2 tr[qr]1/2tr[eqp ] + t(1  t) tr[e(qr + rq)p ].

5

the sign of such an intersection is given by

sign im" (t)
t # .

lemma 4.1 and 4.2 are proven in the appendix. let us rst turn our attention to the faces
c 0

k. with our particular choice of e the following lemma holds.

lemma 4.3 except for a measure zero set of congurations (u, ), the surfaces xh0123i(c 0
k )
do not intersect with 
0 .

the proof of this lemma is given in the appendix. it follows that we only have to consider
the faces c 1
3 , schematicly shown in fig. 4 as quadrilaterals (i), (ii), (iii) respectively.
on these faces, the map xh0123i has the form given in eqs. (i), (ii), (iii). the monopole
number will be the sum of the intersection numbers obtained in each case.

case (i): the image of c 1

(i). as illustrated in fig. 2, it is
naturally divided into two triangles a, b, according to the structure of eqs. (a) and (b).
let us rst consider triangle a. the corners of this triangle are the points p = u01  1, q =
u012  2, r = u0123  3. the surface enclosed by these three points is swept out by the set

of all geodesics between p and the geodesic arc dqr, its orientation being xed by the order

p, q, r of the vertices, see fig. 4. this is the situation described in lemma 4.2, except for
degenerate cases and we use this result to calculate the intersection number of a with 
0 .
inserting the above expressions for p, q, r into eq. (3), we have to consider

ia(t) = t2h0|u01233ihu1233|1ihu011|0i|h2|u233i|

in order to nd the intersections, we must look for solutions 0  t  1 of im ia(t) = 0
for which re ia(t)  0. according to lemma 4.2, such solutions will contribute with the
sign

to the intersection number.

triangle b is swept out by geodesics from the dotted line fig. 2 to the point p = u01 1.
this arc is parametrized by vh01ivh123i(s2)  3. hence by lemma 4.1, we have to nd points
0  s2  1 such that im ib(s2) = 0 and re ib(s2)  0, where ib is the function

trhxh0i(vh01i  xh1i)(vh123i(s2)  xh3i)i .

explicitly, in terms of the parallel transporters and higgs elds, this may be written as

ib(s2) = s2

(5)

+ (1  s2)2h0|u011ih1|u133ihu0133|0i
+ s2(1  s2)h0|u011i(h1|u1233ihu0133|0i
+ h1|u133ihu01233|0i),

which is explicitly seen to be gauge invariant (we have suppressed a positive overall factor
which obviously does not aect our considerations). values of s2 with the above properties

7

may thus be found by elementary means. in the appendix, case ) we show that they make
the following contribution to the intersection number, i.e. have the following sign for the
relative orientation:

sign im"ib(s2)

s2

# .

case (ii): the image of c 1

2 is a square. it is obtained by moving down the geodesic

arc dp q to the arc dxw , see fig. 4. from the parametrization of this surface, eq. (ii) one

concludes that it will intersect the manifold 

0 if and only if

(vh012i(s1)  xh23i(s3))xh0i = 0,
 (vh210i(s1)  xh0i)xh23i(s3) = 0,

(6)

for some 0  s1, s3  1. from eq. (6) we see that this will happen precisely if the geodesic arc
parametrised by xh23i(s3) intersects the manifold (vh210i(s1)0) for some value 0  s1  1.
the arc has endpoints xh2i and vh23i  xh3i. we may apply lemma 4.1 to conclude that
for such an intersection we must have im ii(s1) = 0 and re ii(s1)  0, where ii is the
function

trhxh2i(vh23i  xh3i)(vh210i(s1)  xh0i)i .

expressing everything in terms of parallel transporters and higgs elds, we nd

ii(s1) = s2

+ s1(1  s1)h2|u233i(hu01233|0ih0|u022i
+ hu0233|0ih0|u0122i),

and this is directly seen to be gauge invariant. again as in case (i), we have omitted an
irrelevant positive overall factor. it is shown in the appendix, case ) that such an intersection
contributes with the sign

sign im" ii(s1)

s1

# .

3 is a square, parametrized
case (iii): from eq.
by vh0123i(s1, s2)  xh3i, where 0  s1, s2  1. this square will intersect the manifold 
precisely for values s1, s2 such that

(iii) we can see that the image of c 1

0

xh0i(vh0123i(s1, s2)  xh3i) = 0.

we have to nd such values and determine their contribution to the intersection number.
writing everything in terms of parallel transporters and higgs elds, the above condition
reads iii(s1, s2) = 0, where

iii(s1, s2) = h0|u01233is1s2 + h0|u0133is1(1  s2)

(8)

+ h0|u0233i(1  s1)s2 + h0|u033i(1  s1)(1  s2),

and this expression is manifestly gauge invariant. condition (8) constitutes a system of two
real equations in two real variables, which can easily be solved. in the appendix, case ) it
is demonstrated that any point (s1, s2) satisfying eq. (8) contributes the value

to the intersection number.

5 conclusions and outlook

in this work we have given a geometric denition of local monopole numbers for an su(n)
lattice gauge-higgs system. the denition yields a closed magnetic current which is stable
under perturbations of the conguration in question.
it is explicitly worked out how to
calculate the monopole number for each tetrahedron of a simplicial 4-dimensional lattice.
on the practical side, one has to solve four quadratic equations in one variable for each
such tetrahedron. the coecients of these equations are given by traces of parallel trans-
porters and higgs variables. the prescription is expicitly gauge invariant and can be directly
implemented in a computer code.

while the construction gives an integer local monopole number for almost all eld con-
gurations, the question is on what kind of monopole the construction actually triggers. in
the su(2) case for the georgi-glashow model it has been shown [15] that the construction
is able to detect a discretized t hooft-polyakov monopole, provided the conguration is
smooth enough. this question remains to be discussed for n > 2. on the other hand, for
rough lattice elds as they are generated in a monte-carlo simulation, one has to expect
nonvanishing monopole charges which do not correspond to physical excitations but are lat-
tice artefacts (dislocations). it is then necessary to nd out whether these congurations
become suciently suppressed in the continuum limit.

appendix

points in cpn 1 are identied with equivalence classes [a] = ca (lower case letters) or
projectors a (capital letters) projecting on the subspace spanned by a. two points [p], [q]
are joined by the unique shortest geodesic [(1  t)hp|qip + t|hp|qi|2q], provided hp|qi 6= 0 (see
[20]).

proof of lemma 4.1:

from the form of the geodesics it is clear that the geodesic arc dp q will intersect e i

(1  t)he|pihp|qi + t|hp|qi|2he|qi = 0 for some 0  t  1. this is easily seen to be equivalent
to

re[he|pihp|qihq|ei]  0,

im[he|pihp|qihq|ei] = 0,

proving the lemma.

9

proof of lemma 4.2:

we parametrize the geodesic arc dqr by [p(t)] as above. now the triangle  intersects
e i some arc dp (t)p does. according to lemma 4.1 this can happen if and only if

im tr[p p (t)e] = 0 and re tr[p p (t)e]  0.
inserting the expression for p (t), we see
that these are just the conditions given in the lemma. the statement for the sign of the
intersection is obtained in case .a) below.

proof of lemma 4.3:
the image under the map xh0123i of the faces c 0
k is obtained by coning the boundary of fig.
4 to the point e := 0. let a be any point in this boundary. in order that the geodesic arc

dae intersects e, it is necessary that re tr ae  0, by lemma 4.1. but this is easily seen

to imply ae = 0, i.e. a  e. so the image of the faces c 0
k intersects e if and only if the
boundary of the triangle in fig. 2 does. on dimensional grounds this can happen only for
a measure zero set of congurations.

we now prove the various claims about intersection numbers made above. let us briey recall
how the relative orientation of two oriented, embedded transversally intersecting manifolds
is dened. suppose x, y  z are oriented embedded manifolds, intersecting transversally
at a point p. the union of two oriented frames in tpx and tpy then gives a frame in tpz
whose orientation may be compared to the orientation of z. the sign x : y is dened
to be 1 according to whether these orientations coincide resp. do not coincide. going
over to the case at hand, we identify cn with the real vector space r2n and euclidean
inner product (  ,  ) = reh  ,  i. the tangent space tacpn 1 is canonically identied
with {x  cn = r2n | ax = 0}. each such tangent space may be equipped with the (real)
(2n 2)-form (aia), dening thus a canonical orientation of the complex projective space.
here,  denotes the operation of taking the hodge dual of an alternating form with help of
the above euclidean inner product. in the same fashion, the tangent space tae, ea = 0 is
identied with {x  cn = r2n | ax = ex = 0} and the (real) (2n 4)-form (eieaia)
denes an orientation. suppose we are given a surface in projective space parametrized by
[(s1, s2)]. with the above identications, the tangent space at a point [0] of this surface
is given by the real linear span of x1, x2, where

and the 2-form x1  x2 denes an orientation. now let [0] be also in e, i.e. an intersection
point. then by denition, h0|xii = h0|ei = 0 and one calculates

hence the sign of this intersection point is given by



e+#  (0  i0).

we are now ready to prove the claims made above about the intersection numbers. the
maps given in eqs. (i), (ii), (iii) dene a surface in cpn 1 which is schematically drawn

in fig. 2. the arrows dene an orientation of this surface and the intersection numbers are
dened with respect to this orientation and the canonical orientations given above.

case .a): by denition the surface ia is parametrized by [(s, t)], where

(t, s) = (1  s)h(t)|u011i(t) + s|h(t)|u011i|2u011,
(t) = (1  t)h2|u233iu0122 + t|h2|u233i|2u01233.

the orientation of this surface is given by the order of its vertices p, q, r, dened above. it
is easily seen that this means that this orientation coincides with   , where

with the above notations, x2  x3 is the orientation of this surface. setting e = 0, us-
ing eq. (9) and the denition of ib in eq. (5), it is straightforward to calculate that an
intersection has sign

now setting e = 0, using eq. (9) and the denition of ii in eq. (7), we get the result after
a short computation.

case ): surface iii is a square, parametrized by [(s1, s2)], where x1  x2 is its

orientation and

(s1, s2) = vh0123i(s1, s2)3.

now setting e = 0, it follows immediately from the denition of iii in eq. (8) and from
eq. (9) that the sign of the intersection is given by

sign im" iii(s1, s2)
