abstract: we study a family of bps solutions of type iia supergravity that can
be interpreted as describing the transmutation of a neveu-schwarz ve-brane into
a d4-brane in the presence of a d6-brane. the d4-brane, which terminates on
the d6-brane, can be equally well interpreted as a pure multipole conguration of
ns5-brane wrapped tightly around the d6-brane. such a transmutation is a near-core
version (i.e., near the d6-brane) of the brane-creation that can occur when two branes
pass through each other, as in the hanany-witten construction. the work below high-
lights certain charge non-conservation features of type iia supergravity.

1. introduction

it is by now a familiar story that string and m-theory contain various types of branes
(see [1, 2, 3, 4] for introductions and reviews) which play a fundamental role in our
understanding of the theories. in addition to elucidating the various dualities, they are
central to the ads/cft correspondence [5, 6] and its generalizations [7] and to matrix
theory [8]. typically, the various branes are a net source of some gauge eld, with
a total charge that can be measured by surrounding the brane with an appropriate
gauss law surface and integrating either the eld strength or its dual. measuring the
various charges can tell us what sorts of branes are present in a spacetime.

now, in the associated supergravity theories, not all types of charge are conserved in
all cases. as a result, in suciently complicated situations, it is possible for one type
of brane to transmute into another. the family of type iia supergravity solutions
investigated below turns out to just such a case, in which the presence of a d6-brane
catalyzes the transmutation of an ns5-brane into a d4-brane. this is the supergravity
description near the d6-brane core of the sort of brane creation that arises in the
hanany-witten construction [9] and other examples [10, 11, 12] when two appropriate
branes cross. the family of exact supergravity solutions presented below provides a
supergravity moduli space in which the dynamics of such processes might be further
studied.

interestingly, in our near-core family the ns5-brane seems to disappear completely
despite the fact that the associated current is conserved in the setting considered below.

1

what happens is that the ns5-brane hides itself by folding into a tightly wrapped
conguration that produces no net monopole eld. the shape of the resulting 5-brane
can be thought of as the limit of a (2-dimensional) paraboloid p crossed with a at 3-
space (p  r3) in which the paraboloid degenerates to a half-line. it turns out that the
eld produced by these ns5-branes does not vanish. however, as no gaussian surface
can thread through the (zero-sized) opening of the paraboloid to capture a net ux of
eld, the net charge of such objects is zero for all practical purposes. thus, such brane
congurations may be called fundamental ns5 multipoles: the eld they produce has
no monopole part, but contains only the higher multipole moments1.

nonetheless, due to charge non-conservation eects in type iia supergravity, our
ns5-brane in fact carries a nonzero net d4-brane charge.
in the limit in which the
paraboloid degenerates to a half-string, the brane may equally well be interpreted as
a d4-brane ending on the d6-brane. now, the family of solutions considered below
forms a moduli space that interpolates between a conguration consisting of a at
ns5-brane widely separated from a d6-brane and the conguration with a d4-brane
ending on the d6-brane. thus, by the usual adiabatic arguments, we may consider
this family of solutions to represent a dynamical process in which a slowly moving ns5-
brane approaches from innity, wraps itself around a d6-brane, and transmutes into a
d4-brane ending on the d6-brane.

the family of solutions to be studied below was in fact originally constructed by
hashimoto in [13], using the method of itzhaki, tseytlin, and yankielowicz [14].
it
is obtained by considering the near-core solutions for collections of m5-branes inter-
secting a kaluza-klein monopole and performing a kaluza-klein reduction. the result
must be a collection of d4- and ns5-branes intersecting a d6-brane. by taking into
account certain technical subtleties, we uncover the phenomena described above and
resolve the puzzles concerning such solutions that were raised in [13].

we begin the paper with a particularly transparent lower dimensional example in
section 2. this example is closely related to the one of central interest but several
distracting features have been removed. the construction of the actual type iia solu-
tions is reviewed in section 3, correcting few technical points that will be relevant to
our discussion. we then proceed in section 4 to map out the relevant branes, verifying
that all proceeds in parallel with the lower dimensional case. we conclude with a short
discussion in section 5.

1in curved spacetime, it is not clear that there is a useful distinction between dipole, quadrapole,
etc. elds. however, it is certainly meaningful to refer to elds with zero monopole charge as pure
multipole elds.

2. a transparent example

the set of solutions on which we will focus in sections 3 and 4 will be constructed
following [13], and using the method of [14], by rst considering an m5-brane in at
spacetime. now, since the unit-charged kaluza-klein monopole is in fact smooth at the
center and since one expects that there is in fact a solution2 representing an m5-brane
intersecting an asymptotically at charge n monopole, the m5-brane in at space
should give the near-core version of a solution representing an m5-brane intersecting
a unit charged kaluza-klein monopole. by the appropriate zn quotient of this solution,
one arrives at an m5-brane intersecting an ale space which represents the near-core
solution for a charge n monopole. kaluza-klein reduction will then yield the near-core
solution for a collection of d4- and ns5-branes intersecting a d6-brane.

in the current section, we consider the simpler case of a membrane in at 4+1
minkowski space, and then reduce it in much the same manner as for the m5-brane
mentioned above. the result is a static 3+1 spacetime, for which the three spatial
dimensions are easily visualized. the d6-brane becomes simply a point 0-brane at
the origin of the three space. the kaluza-klein reduction of the membrane yields a
collection of string and membrane charges in the 3+1 spacetime. such a lower dimen-
sional example sets the stage well for our discussion in sections 3 and 4 and provides
an opportunity to introduce some notation.

the example of the present section is not intended to relate to any particular
version of 4+1 supergravity, though it could certainly be made to do so by considering
4+1 minkowski space as some compactication of 11-dimensional supergravity. we
simply take the membrane to be a magnetic source (in analogy with the m5-brane to
be considered below) of some linear u(1) 1-form eld strength f 4+1
. the superscript
on the eld strength refers to the fact that it represents a 4+1 eld, as opposed to the
3+1 elds that will arise in the reduction below.

[1]

for maximal compatibility with our higher dimensional discussion to come and to
t with the notation of [13], let us refer to the four cartesian spatial coordinates as
x7, x8, x9, and x10. these will be grouped into complex combinations:

w = x7 + ix10,

v = x8 + ix9.

(2.1)

we will use w to denote the magnitude |w | of w , and similarly set v = |v |.

we begin with a single two-brane at v = 0. since this is a magnetic source in 4+1
dimensions, its total charge is measured by any 1-sphere which encloses the brane and
must be independent of the choice of this 1-sphere. as a result, the symmetries and

2the intersection manifold is of suciently high dimension, see [15, 16].

the bianchi identity df 4+1 = 0 for v 6= 0 determine the eld strength to be of the form

f 4+1

[1] =

q
8 + x2
2 (x2

(x8dx9  x9dx8) ,

(2.2)

where q denotes the total charge of the brane.

let us now introduce three new coordinates (, , and ) which will describe the
reduced spacetime, and a coordinate  which will label points along the killing orbits.
that is, in the coordinates below, we will reduce along the killing eld k = . the
particular form of the coordinates is given by

v =  sin

w =  cos

ei.

(2.3)

note that the killing eld k acts as a simultaneous rotation of both the v and w
planes. as a result, the only xed point is at the origin v = w = 0. it may be checked
that this is the only singularity in the reduction process. away from v = w = 0,
the orbits of the killing eld are circles and smoothly foliate the 4+1 spacetime. in
the type iia case of sections 3 and 4, when the gravitational eld of the m5-brane is
ignored,  and  become the usual angular coordinates of the d6-brane metric, and
the metric reduces to the that of the near-core d6-brane. the d6-brane metric is of
course smooth outside the origin. see [7, 13, 14] for details. thus, we may think of
, ,  as forming a standard set of spherical coordinates on r3, with some singularity
in the origin. in particular,  ranges over [0, ], with  = 0 and  =  representing the
poles of the 2-sphere. in the current simplied example, this singularity is pointlike
(a 0-brane). this can also be seen from the 4dimensional spatial metric

|dv |2 + |dw |2 = d2 +

(d2 + sin2 d2) + 2 d + sin2 

2

d!2

,

(2.4)

where the rst three terms dene the r3 described above, and the anomalous 1/4 factor
in front of the 2sphere metric gives rise to a singularity at  = 0.

let us now study the orbits of  that lie within the membrane. we see that these
are at  = 0 and that there is one orbit for each  > 0. note that each orbit lies
at a coordinate singularity of , and that this collection of orbits projects under the
reduction to the  = 0 axis. as a result, the projection of the membrane to the reduced
spacetime yields a string-shaped charge which terminates at the 0-brane at the origin.
here we reach a puzzle, related to the ones mentioned in [13]. one is tempted
to interpret the source along the  =  axis as the usual charged string of the 3+1

4

theory. however, this leads to an immediate question about charge conservation. in
3+1 dimensions, one measures the charge of a (magnetic) string by integrating a one-
form eld strength f[1] around a circle enclosing the string. if we consider such a circle
that encloses the string, we see that we can easily deform this circle to a point by
pulling it down past the origin and shrinking the circle to a point on the negative axis
(see fig. 1).

a second such puzzle is that kaluza-klein reduction of the 4+1 eld strength f 4+1
yields both a 3+1 one-form eld strength f[1] and a 3+1 zero-form eld strength f[0].
the reduction proceeds as

[1]

f 4+1

[1] = f[1] + f[0]  d.

(2.5)

for simplicity of notation, we use symbols without superscripts to refer to the 3+1
dimensional elds. in the present case this yields f[1] = q
2 . the puzzle
is that the zero-form eld strength f[0] is associated with magnetic membranes in 3+1
dimensions, although none seem to be present here.

2 d, f[0] = q

for completeness, we mention that there also arises a 2-form eld strength f[2] and
an associated vector potential a[1] from the kaluza-klein reduction of the 4+1 metric.
it turns out that a[1] describes a magnetic monopole:

a[1] =

1
2

(1  cos )d.

(2.6)

let us now return to the issue of charge conservation. since f 4+1

is a closed form,
it follows from (2.5) that f[1] and f[0] must be closed as well. as a result, string charge

[1]

dened by integrating f[1] around closed curves should be conserved. that this is in
fact the case is clear from the result f[1] = q
2 d. such a eld appears to refer to a
string that enters from innity along the  = 0 axis, passes through the origin, and
then exits to innity along the  =  axis.

however, a relevant issue is that the eld strength f[1] is not gauge invariant. as
we can see from (2.5), under a change of coordinates    + (, , ) (which is just a
u(1) gauge transformation of the vector potential a1 that arises from the kaluza-klein
reduction), we have f[1]  f[1] + f[0]  d. as a result, f[1] is a very subtle object in
the presence of a non-trivial a[1] bundle, such as that which describes our magnetic
monopole. for this reason, one typically adds a term to f[1] to make a gauge invariant
eld strength, dening

note that this eld satises

f[1] = f[1]  f[0]  a[1].

d f[1] + f[0]  f[2] = 0,

(2.7)

(2.8)

in vacuum since f[0] and f[1] are closed.

the importance of all this for our discussion becomes clear when we couple a
magnetic current j1 (representing a string source). the above equation of motion
becomes:

d f[1] + f[0]  f[2] = j1,

(2.9)

where  represents the hodge dual. by taking the exterior derivative of this equation,
we see that the string current is in fact not conserved3. we have

dj1 = j2  f[2] + f[0]  j0,

(2.10)

where j2 = df[0] is the current associated with membranes and j0 = df[2] is the current
associated with the monopole at the origin.

note that conservation cannot be restored by recognizing that, in analogy with
the case for m-branes, d-branes, and fundamental strings [19, 20], certain elds may
live on the the monopole and carry the charge of the string. as in [21], one nds that
the pullback of certain bulk elds act as sources and sinks of such brane elds, so that
charge is still not conserved.

as a result, we see that the string current need not be conserved when the other
currents are nonzero. in particular, it is the presence of the monopole (j0) together

3alternatively, one could dene j1 = d f . such a current is conserved, but is non-zero (and equal
to f[0]  f[2]) even when no branes are present. we prefer the denition (2.9) as it leads to the usual
denition of brane charge [17, 2, 18].

with the nonzero f[0] eld that allows the string to end at the origin. in contrast, the
membrane current j2 is in fact conserved in this model.

there remains, however, the issue of the nonzero f[0] eld. from whence does it
arise? we will see that it arises because the string charge along the  = 0 axis may
equally well be interpreted as a tightly rolled paraboloid of membrane. it turns out
that such a tightly rolled membrane is in fact physically equivalent to a half-string.

to see that this is the case, we again follow the lead of [13] and consider the more
general family of solutions obtained by placing not a single membrane at v = 0 in the
4+1 spacetime, but in fact a uniform density of branes around the circle |v | = b. the
branes are still oriented along the w plane, so that we recover the conguration above
in the limit b  0. in this case we have

! for |v | > b,

for |v | < b.

(2.11)

(2.12)

thus, for v =  sin 
2 > b, the gauge elds are independent of b, while they vanish4 for
v < b. for the readers convenience, a diagram showing the constant v surfaces in the
reduced 3-space is shown below in fig.2.

4except of course f[2], which arises purely from the kaluza-klein reduction of the 5-dimensional

metric.

for later reference we also give the explicit projection from the 4 dimensional space to
the 3dimensional depicted above:

x = w v + w v = r sin  cos 
y = i( w v  w v ) = r sin  sin 
z = |w |2  |v |2 = r cos  ,

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

where r = 2/2.

we see that there is a discontinuity in f[0] across the surface v = b. such a
domain wall is associated with a membrane charge sitting on the paraboloid v = b.
we may say that the membrane generates this ux of f[0]. what is unusual about
this case is that the eld strength f[0] does not vanish in the b  0 limit in which
the paraboloid degenerates. instead, the presence of the monopole at the focus of the
paraboloid stabilizes the f[0] eld. however, in the b = 0 limit, one cannot see inside the
degenerate paraboloid and there are no longer any discontinuities in the eld strength.
thus, the limiting distribution of branes cannot be said to contain a net membrane
charge. instead, we refer to it as a pure multipole conguration of branes. we will
see that much the same thing occurs in our higher dimensional case below, where the
resulting eld strength is more interesting.

so, for b 6= 0 it is clear that we have a membrane present on the paraboloid.
what about the strings in this case? note that, since the membrane curves around
the monopole, the term j2  f[2] is nonzero. thus, as noted above, strings will not be
conserved in this spacetime. instead, the membrane will act as a source of strings5.

whether one wishes to consider such strings as separate from the membrane or
as a part of the same object is simply a matter of record keeping. the interesting
question is whether we may consider all strings in the spacetime to be generated by
the membrane. the answer to this question is yes. this fact follows from charge
(non-)conservation. we simply note that any strings entering the spacetime must do
so along the paraboloid in a rotationally symmetric way, converging toward the vertex
of the paraboloid. thus, if charge were conserved, there would need to be some net
ux of strings exiting the vertex of the paraboloid. however, this is not the case. all
brane sources in the spacetime are conned to the paraboloid itself: using the gauge
invariant eld strengths, one can readily check that the source-free equations of motion
are satised in the region v 6= b. of course, string charge is not in fact conserved, and
we therefore conclude that the membrane is congured just so as to annihilate exactly
the amount of string charge that enters from innity.

5on the other hand, since the monopole is inside the paraboloid, we have j0  f[0] = 0 and the

0-brane no longer creates or destroys strings.

8

running the argument backwards, we could say that we begin with zero string
charge at the vertex and that that quantity of string charge exiting to innity is exactly
the amount produced by the membrane. thus, it is natural to view the membrane as the
primary source for the elds, and the strings as a secondary consequence6. in this way,
we can view the string ending on the monopole as being equivalent to the degenerate
limit of the paraboloidal membrane. we may call this process the transmutation,
catalyzed by the presence of the monopole, of a membrane into a string.

3. the m  iia reduction.

we now review the construction of [13], which produces a distribution of ns5-, d4-,
and d6-brane charge in type iia supergravity. we proceed quickly, as the present case
is in direct parallel with the lower dimensional example presented in section (2).

(3.3)

at this point the topology and dierential structure of the spacetime are those of
r1,10. however, we are interested in the topology and dierential structure of r1,6 

6admittedly, this viewpoint is adapted to the high symmetry of this situation. if one now adds to
our solution the proper small ux of strings coming in along the paraboloid from innity near  = 0
and exiting along the paraboloid near  =  one should be able to, for example, obtain a solution
in which the d4-brane charge still vanishes at some point on the paraboloid, though this point will
no longer be at the vertex. it would be interesting to know whether such a solution breaks further
supersymmetries. one would suspect that it does, since it clearly breaks rotational invariance and
supersymmetries square to killing vectors.

c2/zn, which is obtained as follows. dene as in the preceding section w = x7 + ix10
and v = x8 + ix9. the zn orbifold group acts by rotating simultaneously this two
complex coordinates,i.e.,

zn : c2  c2

(v, w ) 7 e

2i

n (v, w ) .

c2/zn is the 4dimensional manifold dened by identifying points in c2 which are
related by the action of zn. our spacetime manifold is topologically the product of
r6,1 (in x0, . . . x6) and c2/zn (in x7, . . . , x10). clearly, all the elds are invariant
under rotations in the (x7, x10) and (x8, x9) planes. therefore dening w = wei/n
and v = vei(+/n ), for ,   [0, 2), the vector eld  is a killing vector eld.
one dimensionally reduces along this vector eld to obtain the desired 10-dimensional
solutions.

recall that dimensional reduction to 10dimensional type iia supergravity identi-
es the dierent elds as follows, where z is a coordinate along the killing orbits used
in the reduction:

ds2
(11) = e2/3ds2 + e4/3(dz + a[1])2 ,
f (11)
[4] = f[4] + f[3]  (dz + a[1]) .

useful to dene coordinates in analogy with (2.3) through

v =  sin

w =  cos

e/n .

(3.6)

note that in these coordinates, the action of zn takes the convenient form  7
 + 2. as it is standard in dimensional reduction to use a killing vector eld with
dimensions of inverse length, one takes z = /r11 for some xed radius r11. to
present the dimensionally reduced eld strengths it is convenient to rst introduce
spherical coordinates in (x4, x5, x6, x8, x9) dened by

x4 = r cos  ,

x5 = r sin  cos  ,

x6 = r sin  sin  cos  ,

x8 = r sin  sin  sin  cos( + /n)

x9 = r sin  sin  sin  sin( + /n) ,

x7 = w cos(/n) ,

x10 = w sin(/n) ,

for 0  , ,  < , 0  ,  < 2 and r, w real and positive. taking (r, , , , , w)
to label the killing orbits leads to the same reduction as (3.6). now, from (3.5) we

the ten-dimensional elds above are somewhat dierent from the elds originally
presented in [13]. in particular, our 3-form eld strength f[3] is non-zero as given by
(3.8). this dierence is due to certain subtleties associated with dimensional reduction
and hodge duals in spacetimes with non-diagonal metrics that were not taken fully
into account in [13]. in particular, it is the eld strength f (11)
that is related to the
standard ten-dimensional elds by (3.5), while the relation of its hodge dual 7-form
eld strength (f (11)

[7] ) to the ten-dimensional elds is more complicated.

dimensional magnetic object: a d6brane of type iia supergravity. as usual, the
magnetic potential shows a stringlike singularity, extending from the origin to inn-
ity through the negative zaxis of the reduced ale space. this corresponds to the
points w = 0 in the above coordinates. as in section 2, we may again generalize to
a family of solutions constructed from a set of m5-branes oriented along the 5-space
(w, w , x1, x2, x3) and smeared over the circle |v | = b.

4. brane mapping

having reviewed the basic construction of the solution in section 3, we need only check
a few basic features in order to map out all of the branes and show conclusively that it
can be interpreted in parallel with the discussion of section 2. one distracting feature
of the present case is that the magnetic monopole associated with the f[2] resulting
from the kaluza-klein reduction is no longer a point defect, but an entire d6-brane.
this makes a discussion of charge conservation more subtle as d4-brane charge (the
analogue of string charge in section 2) is now measured not just with a circle around
the  axis, but with a 5-sphere which extends in certain directions along the d6-brane.
as a result, the corresponding 5-sphere can no longer be deformed to a point without

11

intersecting any charge. what happens is that, when one tries to pull the 5-sphere
down into the lower half of the ale space, one necessarily encounters some part of the
d6-brane located at some nonzero value of x4, x5, or x6. however, as we will see, this
feature is a mere distraction and does not signicantly change the interpretation of the
solution.

let us rst comment on charge conservation. to clarify this point, note that from

(3.5) the equation of motion for f[4] away from any source is

d f[4] + f[2]  f[3] = 0.

(4.1)

here we have used the fact that df (11)
which is also clear from (3.5). when 4branes are present, equation (4.1) is written

[4] = 0 outside the sources, and that f[3] is closed,

d f[4] + f[2]  f[3] = j4

(4.2)

in analogy with (2.9), where now j4 is the hodge dual of the current associated with
4brane charge. taking the exterior derivative of this equation we nd, in analogy with
(2.10),

dj4 = j6  f[3] + f[2]  j5,

(4.3)

where j6 and j5 are the currents associated to d6 and ns5branes respectively. this
shows that the 4brane charge need not be conserved in the presence of ns5 and
d6branes, which is indeed the case in which we are interested.

we now check that all of the branes are in fact located on the paraboloid at v = b.
to do so, recall that for the original 11dimensional solution, we had df (11)
[4] = j(11)
.
the general case b 6= 0 is obtained[13] by including a set of m5branes smeared along
 at |v | = b .
in this way we keep the original symmetry along , and the (11
dimensional) hodge dual of the current is,

5 =

q

(x4)(x5)(x6)(v  b)dx4  dx5  dx6  dv  d  ,

where  =  + /n is the angle in the (x8, x9) plane. from this expression we can
easily get the equations of motion for the 10dimensional elds,

df[3] = j5 =

d f[4] + f[2]  f[3] = j4 =

(4.5)

in such coordinates a[1] takes the form,

a[1] =

nr11

(4.6)

from (4.5) and (4.6) we immediately see that there can be 4brane charge only on the
surface of the paraboloid at x4 = x5 = x6 = 0, v = b. note that j4 goes to zero at both
v = 0 and w = 0. this rules out the possibility of having a singularity at those points,
where the form d is not well dened. the harmonic function f , which also diverges
only at the paraboloid, is given by

f = 1 +

d

(s2 + |v  bei|2)3/2 ,

(4.7)

where s2 = x2
v = b.

6. as a result, it is clear that all branes lie along the paraboloid

the eld strengths of the 10dimensional theory can be obtained from the 11

dimensional solution which, in this generic case is,

f (11)

[4] = (av[x4dx5  dx6 + x5dx6  dx4 + x6dx4  dx5]  dv

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

now, for non-zero b, we may easily work around the distraction of the d6-brane
in interpreting the d4-brane charge distribution. by symmetry, any d4-branes on the
paraboloid must enter in a rotationally invariant fashion along the opening at innity
and run along surfaces of constant . consider then the subsurface s at some constant
, v = b, and x4, x5, x6 = 0 which would describe the world-surface of such a d4-brane.
note that we can surround it with a small 5-sphere that can be deformed from innity
down to the vertex of the paraboloid without intersecting any charge (and, in particular,
without intersecting the d6-brane at the origin of the ale space). two-dimensional
projections of such spheres lie on the boundaries of the tubes shown in fig. 3 below.
thus, for b 6= 0, we may discuss conservation of d4-brane charge in direct parallel with
section 2. since there are no branes exiting the vertex of the paraboloid along the
 = 0,  axes, the d4-brane charge at the vertex must vanish by rotational invariance,
as can be checked directly from (4.5).
it follows that all d4-brane charge may be
thought of as generated by the ns5-brane in the background eld of the d6-brane
through the charge non-conservation laws of type iia supergravity.

d4 encrustations

figure 3: the d4charge goes to a constant value for large values of w. for w = 0, at the
vertex of the paraboloid, the charge goes to zero which is possible due to the non conservation
of this charge. the individual d4brane sources are distributed along the paraboloid at values
of constant  and can be seen as encrustations on the 5brane.

we would now like to address the issue of the nite f[3] eld strength created by
the pure multipole conguration of the ns5-brane in the b  0 limit. the interesting
dierence between this and, say, point dipoles in familiar maxwell electrodynamics is
that in the familiar maxwell case such non-trivial pure dipole elds arise only when an
innite amount of charge is present. it is thus of interest to quickly check that the total
amount of ns5-brane does not diverge as b  0, and that it is in fact independent of
b. this can be seen from (4.4), but we will show an independent computation in order
to further illuminate the geometry of the system.

dene a cube letting l  x4, x5, x6  l with v = 0 and w = w0 xed. a second
cube is dened in the same way but with v = v0 > b. we nish closing our 3manifold
with the surface dened by the interval 0  v and the faces of the previous cube in
(x4, x5, x6).

this 3 surface clearly encloses the 5brane, and we can easily compute the integral
of f[3] over it. to do so rst note that, due to (4.8), the integral over the cube at v = 0
is zero. the integral over the surface joining the two cubes goes to zero in the limit
l  . to see this, let us integrate over one of this surfaces, say, x4 = l,

5. discussion

we have studied a family of type iia supergravity solutions obtained by the reduction
of a family of 11-dimensional solutions. one member of this family describes a pure
multipole conguration of ns5-branes stabilized by the presence of a d6-brane.
in
this pure-multipole limit, the ns5-brane in fact becomes a d4-brane ending on the
d6-brane. by varying a parameter b from  to zero, we obtain a family of bps solu-
tions in which an ns5-brane moves in from innity, curves around the d6-brane, and
degenerates into the d4-brane ending on the d6-brane. this sort of brane transmu-
tation arises due to the lack of a conservation law for certain types of charge in type
iia supergravity, so that an ns5-brane in the background eld of a d6-brane can act
as a source of d4-brane charge. it is clear from the 11-dimensional description that
all members of this family preserve the same supersymmetries, so that our family in
fact forms a moduli space. by the usual adiabatic arguments, this moduli space can
therefore be associated with a dynamical process in which a slowly moving ns5-brane
approaches a d6-brane, wraps around it, and transmutes itself into a d4-brane.

although we have studied only the near-core solution in explicit form, we expect
a corresponding asymptotically at solution with similar properties. one might at
rst expect that the ns5-brane remains at far from the d6-brane, in which case the
asymptotically at analogue of our b = 0 solution would resemble the diagram below.
this is a clear analogue of the brane-creation processes discussed by hanany and witten
[9] and others [10, 11, 12]. as a result, the moduli space mentioned above provides a
dynamical supergravity description of such phenomena.

we recall, however, that when a given brane (our d4-brane) ends on a brane of one
dimension higher (the ns5-brane), the larger brane takes the shape of a logarithmic
curve and does not quite become at at innity[23]. thus, the gure above will be
somewhat modied. in any case, we expect a limit in which the atter parts of the
ns5-brane move up the page and o to innity so that the total ns5-brane charge
vanishes as measured by any gaussian surface in the spacetime. this limiting solution
represents a d4-brane ending on a d6-brane in the presence of a nonzero neveu-schwarz
eld strength.

as this solution has three translational symmetries, it is straightforward to t-
dualize up to three times, obtaining solutions with multipole ns5-branes representing
d3-branes ending on d5-branes, d2-branes ending on d4-branes, or d1-branes ending
on d3-branes. either of the type iib solutions are readily s-dualized as well, and this
last one then yields a smeared solution containing fundamental strings ending on a
d3-brane stabilizing a pure multipole conguration of d5-brane.

returning to our near-core solutions, one issue that we should pin down more care-
fully is whether pure-multipole congurations of ns5-brane charge are in fact generi-
cally associated with the ending of a d4-brane on a d6-brane or whether there exists
another solution in which only the elds usually associated with d4- and d6-branes are
excited. that the presence of a nonzero neveu-schwarz eld is generic can be argued
by charge conservation. as discussed in section 2, the presence of a d6-brane is not by
itself enough to foil conservation of d4-brane charge. breaking charge conservation nec-
essarily requires the presence of a ramond-ramond eld as well. however, one might
seek a solution in which d4-brane charge is conserved but merely ows away along the
d6-brane in the x4, x5, x6 directions. indeed, a striking feature of our solution is that
no d4-brane charge leaks into the d6-brane at all.

we therefore turn to a second argument that the ns-eld is generic. let us t-
dualize our solution 3 times (to obtain a d-string ending on a d3-brane) and then s-
dualize to obtain a fundamental string ending on a d3-brane. t-duality will leave our
tightly wrapped ns5-brane an ns5-brane, and s-duality will turn it into a d5-brane.
thus, if an ns5-brane is always associated with a d4-bane ending on a d6-brane, we
would expect a fundamental string ending on a d3-brane to be associated with a pure-
multipole d5-brane. this brane-ending conguration was investigated in the appendix
of [16] using perturbative techniques and the dirac-born-infeld action for the branes.
a look at the ramond-ramond elds found there does indeed show the presence of
a magnetic elds of the sort that would be associated with a certain pure-multipole
conguration of d5-branes. note, however, that the charge non-conservation eect
could not be seen in [16] as the elds were computed there only to rst order in the
charges, while we see from (2.10) that charge non-conservation is a second order eect.

16

similarly, charge non-conservation will not be seen in other lowest order perturbative
calculations.

finally, a third argument that the solution studied above is in fact the solution
for d4-branes ending on d6-branes is obtained by considering what happens when
we add a second paraboloid of ns5-branes enclosing the negative axis. this is most
easily studied in the simplied example of section 2, but may be done in the full 11-
dimensional supergravity case as well. one begins with the spacetime considered above
having branes at |v | = b oriented along the w plane. one then inserts an additional
set of branes oriented along the v plane and located at |w | = b. in the limit b  0, we
obtain two orthogonally intersecting branes at v = 0 and w = 0. after kaluza-klein
reduction, we nd strings along the positive and negative axes. it is readily checked
that the neveu-schwarz eld strength vanishes when the signs are chosen such that
these form a continuous d4-brane passing through the d6-brane. thus, assembling
two of our half-branes does in fact make a familiar neveu-schwarz-free d4-brane.

this last argument allows us to easily check that the general solution from section
3, which contains a mixture of d4-, ns5-, and d6-brane charge, is in fact a bps
conguration. the point is that the 11-dimensional conguration of two m5-branes at
v = 0 and w = 0 with signs as above is a typical branes at angles solution (see [24])
preserving 1/4 of the supersymmetries. now, since the type iia conguration with
a d4-brane orthogonally intersecting a d6-brane is also a 1/4 bps solution, we see
that no supersymmetries of the branes at angles solution are broken in the reduction
process. since all of these supersymmetries are also present in the case of a single set of
branes oriented along the w -plane (located at either v = 0 or |v | = b), we can indeed
be sure that our type iia solutions represent a moduli space of bps congurations
preserving the same 1/4 of the supersymmetries.

having concluded that the b = 0 case does indeed represent the solution for a
d4-brane ending on a d6-brane, we deduce that another qualitative dierence should
arise between the near-core solutions studied above and the full asymptotically at
solutions. in our near core solutions, the eld strengths f[3] and f[4] associated with
ns5- and d4-brane charge are of comparable magnitude. in fact, in an appropriate
gauge we have just f[4] = f[3]  (d/nr11  a[1]), where nr11 is roughly the tension
of the d6-brane. in the full asymptotically at solution for b = 0, we would expect
the f[3] eld to fall o faster than the f[4] eld, reducing to that of a pure d4-brane
as we move along the d4-brane and away from the d6-brane. something like this is
seen, for example, in the perturbative calculation in [16] of the elds generated by a
fundamental string ending on a d3-brane. it appears that the degeneracy seen in the
near-core solutions is a consequence of the fact that the near-core region of the kaluza-
klein monopole has an so(4) rotational symmetry, while the full solution breaks this

17

to so(3)  u(1).

a nal natural question to ask is whether all brane ending phenomena in which a
half-brane ends on a terminal brane arise in this way. that is, can they all arise as a
case of brane transmutation, with the resulting half-branes being formed as some larger
brane wraps itself tightly around the terminal brane? if this is the case, then all brane-
ending solutions must resemble the one above, in which the charge of the half-brane
is in fact absorbed by the terminal brane and does not ow along the terminal brane
to innity7. while we cannot reach a denite conclusion here, we note that the charge
non-conservation eect arises from chern-simons-like couplings and that an analysis
of such couplings as in [25] does make an armative answer seem likely. we expect
such considerations to provide interesting examples for further study.
