introduction

the gauge theory are usually formulated in terms of non-gauge-invariant
variables, like potentials ak
(x) [1]. however, the physical observables are
gauge invariant. the connection between potentials and observables is es-
tablished by choosing a specic gauge. this rises many diculties even in
the classical theories. for example, some solutions of the eld equations
can be spherical symmetric in a chosen gauge, but they may nor have this
symmetry in other gauges. in addition, the potentials can be singular in one
and non-singular in others.

at the quantum level these diculties are even more serious. for ex-
ample, the quantization of one and the same theory in dierent gauges can
give rise to non-equivalent theories.

however, the physicists prefer to use the non-gauge-invariant potentials

because of the following advantages:

(i) the theory has a local character;
(ii) the relativistic invariance is manifest;
(iii) the lagrangian formalism applies in the standard form
recently, some models of gauge theories on euclidean and minkowskian
3-dimensional spaces have been developed in terms of gauge-invariant vari-
ables [2], [3]. the fundamental quantity is the gauge-invariant tensor gij =
 1
2 ijkf jk is the dual of the gauge eld tensor
2 t r(f 
f ij. it has been shown that this metric satises the einstein equations with
the right-hand side of a very simple form [3].

i fj), where fi = 1

in a recent work [4] we generalized this theory to the case of a curved
space-time. namely, we developed a su (2) gauge theory on the three-
dimensional sphere s 3. the manifold s 3 is a space with constant curvature,
and the generalization of the theory to this case is not trivial. we used the
advantage that the dimensions of the su (2) group and of the s 3 sphere are
the same.

in this paper, we develope a model of su (2) gauge theory in terms of
local gauge-invariant variables dened over a 4-dimensional space-time. we
dene a metric tensor g, ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3, starting with the components f k

and ef k
 of the tensor associated to the yang-mills eld and, respectively, to
its dual. the components g are interpreted as new local gauge variables
and they are calculated for a particular gauge eld dened over the r  s 3
it is shown that these components determine the gauge eld
space-time.

equations when some supplementary conditions are imposed.

our metric g do not make the eld strength self-dual. in order to assure
this property a convenient scale factor  is introduced in the expression of
the metric g. it is concluded that the self-dual variables are nor compatible
with the geometric structure of the space-time r  s 3.
two families of analytical solutions for the eld equations of the gauge
elds are also given.
it is proven that these solutions are not of solitonic
type, but they can be used to determine the structure of vacuum state for
the gauge elds considered in this paper.

2 gauge potentials

we consider the su (2) yang-mills theory in the space-time r s 3 endowed
with the metric:

ds2 = dt2 + d2 + sin2 (d2 + sin2 d2)

(2.1)

where t is the time coordinate on the real line r and ,  and  are the
angular coordinates on the three-dimensional sphere s 3 [5]. let p (m, g, )
be the principal bre bundle with m = r  s 3 as the base manifold and
g = su (2) as the structural group. the mapping  : p  m is the natural
projection of p onto m . the innitesimal generators of the su (2) group
are chosen in the form:

tk =

1
2i

k , k  1, 2, 3

where k are the pauli matrices.

the corresponding structure equations are:

[tk, tl] = klmtm

(2.2)

(2.3)

where klm is the antisymmetric tensor of rank 3 with 123 = 1.

the gauge potentials a = ak

tk , with values in the lie algebra of
the group su (2) , determine a connection on the principal bre bundle
p (m, g, ) [6]. we will consider the following ansatz [7] for the gauge po-
tentials:

a0 = t3,
a2 = w t2, a4 = cos t3  w sin t1

a1 = 0

where  and w are two unknown functions depending only on the variable
. therefore, the components ak
 of these gauge potentials are the following:

(2.4)

a2
0 = 0, a2
a3
0 = , a3

1 = 0, a1
1 = 0, a2
1 = 0, a3

2 = 0, a1
2 = w,
2 = 0,

3 = w cos 
a3

a2
3 = cos 

3 = 0

(2.5)

the tensor of the gauge elds f = f k

tk, with values in the lie algebra

of su (2), is dened by the formula [8]:

(2.6)
where  denotes the derivatives with respect to the variables x = (t, , , )
and  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

f = a  a + [a, a ]

the non-null components of this tensor are:

02 = w ,

f 1
03 = w sin 

f 2

f 3

03 =

f 1
13 = w

(2.7)

where 
w with respect to the variable .

d and w

= dw



d are the derivatives of the two functions  and

in the next section we will determine a metric tensor g starting with

the tensor f and its dual ef . the components of this metric tensor will
be interpreted as a local gauge-invariant variables for the su (2) yang-mills
theory on the space-time r  s 3.

3 local gauge-invariant variables

the gauge potentials ak
 are not invariant under the gauge transformations.
in order to obtain new variables, which are invariant, we dene rst the dual

ef of the strength tensor eld f [9]:

f =

1
2

gf

where  is the antisymmetric tensor of rank 4, with 0123 = 1. then,
using the above result (2.7), we obtain the following non-null components

(3.1)

(3.2)

of the dual ef :



02 = w

gf 1
sin , gf 1
12 = w sin , gf 2
gf 2
gf 3
01 = (w 2  1) sin  gf 3

02 = w ,
03 = w
,
23 =

now, we introduce new local gauge-invariant variables g, given by [10]:

and:

g =

g =

gf l
31/3 klmgf k
gf m

here,  is a scale factor which will be chosen of a convenient form in what
follows.

introducing the expressions (2.7) and (3.2) of the tensor f and re-

spectively of its dual ef, we obtain the following non-null components of

g:



1/3 w 22
1/3 w 2



sin ,
sin ,

g00 = 2
g11 = 2
1/3 w w
1/3 w w

g22 = 2
g33 = 2





(w 2  1) sin ,
(w 2  1) sin3 ,

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.8)

(3.9)

having these quantities determined, we introduce a new metric manifold,
whose line element written in the variables (t, , , ) is:

d2 = g00dt2 + g11d2 + g22d2 + g33d2

(3.6)

or:

d2 = 



2w 22

sin 

"dt2 

w 2
w 22 d2 +

w



(1  w 2)
w 

(cid:16)d2 + sin2 d2(cid:17)#

(3.7)

if we chose now the scale factor  in the form:

1/3 = 2w 22



sin 

then (3.7) reduces to:

d2 = dt2 

w 2
w 22 d2 +

(1  w 2)
w 

(cid:16)d2 + sin2 d2(cid:17)

the line element (3.9) coincides with that of the space-time r s 3 given

in (2.1) if we impose the following supplementary conditions:



w

= dw

d = iw , 



=

d
d

= i

1  w 2
sin2 

(3.10)

but the conditions (3.10) are nothing than the eld yang-mills equations
 [9]. in fact, the yang-mills equations are dierential

for the potentials ak

equations of second order; in the case of the ansatz (2.40), they have the
following form:

d

d(cid:18) dw

d(cid:18) d
d (cid:19) = w 2 

sin2 (cid:19) = 2w 2
(1  w 2)
sin2 

(3.11)

(3.12)

w

it is easy to verify that the equations (3.11)-(3.12) are equivalent with

the rst order equations given in (3.10).

therefore, we conclude that the scale factor  chosen in (3.8) together
with the eld equations of the gauge potentials (2.5), reduce the metric g
to that of the space-time r  s 3.
it is important to remark that choosing  as in (3.8) we do not obtain
a self-dual gauge theory, i.e. f is not a self-dual tensor. this means that
the following condition of self-duality is not satised [10]:

1
2g

 ggf = f

(3.13)

where g = det(g). therefore, the metric (2.1) of the space-time is not
compatible with a self-dual su (2) gauge theory.

in order to satisfy the condition (3.13) we should choose the factor  in

the form:

 = 82w 2w

2(w 2  1) sin3 

in this case we obtain:

g = det(g) =

2/3

1
4

(3.14)

(3.15)

however, the metric components g in (3.5) do not correspond to the ge-
ometry of the space-time r  s 3 when  is given by (3.14). therefore, the
space-time r  s 3 do not admit a self-dual su (2) gauge theory.

4 solutions of the eld equations

we have obtained two families of analytic solutions of the eld equations
(3.10) [9]. first of them is:

() = i cot()  i cot()

w () = 

 sin 
sin()

6

(4.1)

(4.2)

where  is an arbitrary constant. the chern index of this solution is:

c2 =z 
0 h



(1  w 2)  2w w



i = (1  w 2) |

0 = 0

(4.3)

this value of c2 shows that the solutions (4.1)-(4.2) in rst family are not
of instanton type.

the second family of solutions for the eld equations 93.10) is given by

[9]:

() = i coth()  i cot()

w () = 

 sin 
sinh()

(4.1)

(4.2)

where  is an arbitrary real constant. the chern index has, in this case, the
value c2 = . therefore, the solutions in this family are not of instanton
type too.
however, the solutions in the two families can be used for studying the

vacuum structure of the elds under considerations.

5 concluding remarks

in this paper we have developed a gauge theory in terms of local gauge-
invariant variables dened over the space-time r  s 3. a metric tensor
g, ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3, has been constructed starting with the components
of the strength tensor f and of its dual ef. the components g have
been interpreted as new local gauge-invariant variables and they have been
calculated for some particular gauge elds dened over the space-time rs 3.
we proved that these components determine the gauge eld equations if
some supplementary constraints are imposed. on the other hand we showed
that the metric tensor g do not make the eld strength f self-dual. in
order to assure this property, a convenient scale factor  has been introduced
in the expression of g. we concluded that the self-dual variables are not
compatible with the geometric structure of the space-time r  s 3.
finally, two families of analitical solutions of the gauge eld equations
have been obtained. we proved that these solutions are not of instanton
type, but they could be used to determine the structure of the vacuum state
for the gauge elds considered in this paper.
