abstract

the linear particle-antiparticle conjugation c and position space reection
p as well as the antilinear time reection t are shown to be inducable by the
selfduality of representations for the operation groups su(2), sl( ic2) and ir
for spin, lorentz transformations and time translations resp. the denition
of a colour compatible linear cp-reection for quarks as selfduality induced is
impossible since triplet and antitriplet su(3)-representations are not linearly
equivalent.

1.1 reections

a reection will be dened to be an involution of a nite dimensional vector
space v

v

r v, r  r = idv  r = r1

i.e. a realization of the parity group2 ii(2) = {1} in the v -bijections which
is linear for a real space and may be linear or antilinear for a complex space

r(v)

(antilinear)

r(v + w) = r(v) + r(w), r(v) = ( r(v)
an antilinear reection for a complex space v = icn is a real linear one for its
real forms v = ir2n.

for   ir or ic (linear)
for   ic,

the inversion of the real numbers    is the simplest nontrivial lin-
ear reection, the canonical conjugation    is the simplest nontrivial
2since the parity group is used as multiplicative group, i do not use the additive notation zz2 = {0, 1}.

1.2 mirrors

0

r(v) = v}, i.e.

r = {v

the xpoints of a linear reection v +
r(v) = v} , i.e. the elements
with even parity, in an n-dimensional space constitute a vector subspace, the
mirror for the reection r, with dimension 0  m  n with the complement
v r = {v
the elements with odd parity, for the direct
r  v r . the central reection r =  idv has the
decomposition v = v +
origin as a 0-dimensional mirror. linear reections are diagonalizable r =
(cid:16) 1m
0 1nm(cid:17) with (m, n  m) the signature characterizing the degeneracy of
1 in the spectrum of r. and vice versa: any direct decomposition v =
v +  v  denes two reections with the mirror either v + or v .
with ( det r)2 = 1 any linear reection has either a positive or a negative
orientation. looking in the 2-dimensional bathroom mirror is formalized by
the negatively oriented 3-space reection (x, y, z)  (x, y, z). the position
space ir3 reection ~x 13 ~x with negative orientation or the minkowski
spacetime translation ir4 reection x 14 x with positive orientation are
central reections with the origins here and here-now as point mirrors. a
p (x0,~x) in minkowski space or a time reection
space reection (x0, ~x)
t (x0, ~x) have both negative orientation with a 1-dimensional time
(x0, ~x)
and 3-dimensional position space mirror resp.

1.3 reections in orthogonal groups

0

a real linear reection r = (cid:16) 1m

0 1nm(cid:17) can be considered to be an element

of an orthogonal group o(p, q) for any3 (p, q) with p + q = n. a positively
oriented reection, det r = 1, is is an element even of the special orthogonal
groups, r  so(p, q), p + q  1.
as seen in the simplest compact and noncompact examples

orthogonal groups have discrete (semi)direct factor parity subgroups ii(2)

 sin  cos  (cid:17),
o(2)  (cid:16)  cos   sin 
o(1, 1)  (cid:16)  cosh   sinh 
cosh  (cid:17),

sinh 

  ii(2) = {1},   [0, 2[
,   ii(2),

  ir

in general, the classes of a real orthogonal groups with respect to its special
normal subgroup constitute a reection group

o(p, q)/so(p, q) = ii(2)

for real odd dimensional spaces v , e.g. for position space ir3, one has direct
products of the special groups with the central reection group, whereas for

3the orthogonal signature (p, q) has nothing to do with the reection signature (n, m).

2

even dimensional spaces, e.g. a minkowski space ir4, there arise semidirect
products (denoted by ~ ) of the special group with a reection group which
can be generated by any negatively oriented reection

o(p, q) = 


ii(2)  so(p, q), p + q = 1, 3, . . .
ii(2) = { idv }
ii(2) ~ so(p, q), p + q = 2, 4, . . .
ii(2) = {r, idv } with det r = 1

in the semidirect case the product is given as follows

(i, )  ii(2) ~ so(p, q)  (i1, 1)(i2, 2) = (i1  i2, 1  i1  2  i1)

obviously, in the semidirect case the reection group ii(2) is not compatible
with the action of the (special) orthogonal group.

p + q = 2, 4, . . . , det r = 1  [r, so(p, q)] 6= {0}

e.g. the group o(2) is nonabelian, or, a space reection and a time reection
of minkowski space is not lorentz group so(1, 3) compatible.

for noncompact orthogonal groups there is another discrete reection group:
the connected subgroup g0 (unit connection component and lie algebra ex-
ponent) of a lie group g is normal with a discrete quotient group g/g0. the
connected components of the full orthogonal groups are those of the special
groups o0(p, q) = so0(p, q). for the compact case they are the special groups,
for the noncompact ones one has two components

so0(n) = so(n)

pq  1  so(p, q)/so0(p, q) = ii(2)

summarizing: a compact orthogonal group gives rise to a reection group

ii(2)

o(n) = ( {1n}  so(n), n = 1, 3, . . .

n = 2, 4, . . .

ii(2) ~ so(n),

with ii(2) = {r, 1n}, det r = 1

a noncompact one to a reection klein group ii(2)  ii(2)
pq  1 : o(p, q) = ( {1p+q}  [ ii(2) ~ so0(p, q)], p + q = 3, 5, . . .
ii(2) ~ [{1p+q}  so0(p, q)], p + q = 2, 4, . . .

with ii(2) = {r, 1n}, det r = 1

for a noncompact o(p, q) with p = 1 the connected subgroup is the or-
thochronous group, compatible with the order on the vector space v = ir1+q,
e.g. for minkowski spacetime

o(1, 3) = ii(2) ~ [ ii(2)  so0(1, 3)]

where the reection klein group can be generated by the central reection 14
and a position space reection p
ii(2)  ii(2) = {p, 14}  {14} = {14, p, t = p},
0 13(cid:17), t = 14  p = (cid:16) 1
13(cid:17)

[so0(1, 3), p] 6= {0}

p = (cid:16) 1

also the connected subgroup so0(p, q) may contain positively oriented re-
ections which are called continuous since they can be written as exponentials
r = el with an element of the orthogonal lie algebra4, l  log so0(p, q). e.g
the central reections 12n  so(2n) in even dimensional euclidean spaces,
in the euclidean 2-plane. a negatively oriented reection r of a space
e.g.
v can be embedded as a reection r  s with any orientation of a strictly
higher dimensional space v  w

v

r v,

det r = 1

v  w r  s v  w, det (r  s) =  det s

where, for compact orthogonal groups on v and v  w , a reection r  s
with det s = 1 is a continuous reection, i.e. a rotation. there are the
familiar examples[2] for o(n)  so(n + 1): two letter noodles in l-form,
lying with opposite helicity on the kitchen table, can be 3-space rotated into
each other, or, a left and a right handed glove are identical up to euclidean
4-space rotations. the embedding of the central position space reection into
minkowski spacetime can go into a positively or negatively oriented reection
which are both not continuous, i.e. they are in the discrete klein reection
group

2 reections for spinors

the doubly connected groups so(3) and so0(1, 3) can be complex represented
via their simply connected covering groups su(2) and5 sl( ic2) resp.

so(3) = su(2)/{12}, so0(1, 3) = sl( ic2)/{12},

the reection group {12} for the so(3)-classes in su(2) and the so0(1, 3)-
classes in sl( ic2) contains the continuous central ic2-reection 12 = ei3 
su(2).

2.1 the pauli spinor reection

the fundamental dening su(2)-representation for the rotations acts on pauli
spinors w = ic2

u = ei~~  su(2) (pauli matrices ~)

they have an invariant antisymmetric bilinear form (spinor metric)

 : w  w  ic,

(a, b) = ab = ba, a, b = 1, 2

4log g denotes the lie algebra of the lie group g.
5throughout this paper the group sl( ic2) is used as real 6-dimensional lie group.

2.2 reections c and p for weyl spinors

3 time reection

the time representations dene the antilinear reection t for time translation.
the dierent duality with respect to sl( ic2) and lorentz group representa-
tions, on the one side, and time representations, on the other side, leads to the
nontrivial c, p, t cooperation.

3.1 reection t of time translations

the irreducible time representations, familiar from the quantum mechanical
harmonic oscillator with time action eigenvalue (frequency) , with their duals
(inverse transposed) are complex 1-dimensional

t 7 eit  gl(u),

the fact that the antilinear cpt-reection is - up to a number conjuga-

lorentz group so0(1, 3), is decisive for the proof of the well known cpt-
theorem[4, 3]

4 spinor induced reections

the linear spinor reections  for pauli spinors and c, p for weyl spinors are
inducable on all irreducible nite dimensional representations of su(2) and

9

sl( ic2) with their adjoint groups so(3) and so0(1, 3) resp. via the general
procedure: given the group g action on two vector spaces its tensor product
representation reads

g  (v1  v2)  v1  v2, g  (v1  v2) = (g  v1)  (g  v2)

a realization of the simple reection group ii(2) = {1} is either faithful or
trivial.

4.1 spinor induced reection of position space
the reection w  w t for a pauli spinor space w = ic2 induces the central
reection of position space whose elements come - in the pauli representation
of position space - as traceless hermitian (2  2)-matrices

4.2

induced reections of spin representation spaces

all irreducible complex representations of the spin group su(2) with 2j =
0, 1, 2, . . . have an invariant bilinear form arising as a symmetric tensor product
of the antisymmetric spinor metric . the bilinear form is given for the
irreducible representation [2j] =
corresponding totally symmetric9 power and is antisymmetric for halnteger
spin and symmetric for integer spin

_u on the vector space

_w = ic2j+1 by the

8

the linear mappings {v  w} for nite dimensional vector spaces are naturally isomorphic to the

tensor product w  v t with the linear v -forms v t .

9_ and^ denotes symmetrized and antisymmetrized tensor products.

10

the complex representation spaces for integer spin j = 0, 1, . . ., acted

upon faithfully only with the special rotations so(3) = su(2)/{12}, are
direct sums of two irreducible real so(3)-representation spaces ir2j+1 where
the invariant bilinear form is symmetric and denite, e.g. the negative denite

killing form 13 for the adjoint representation [2] = u  u on ir3.

the pauli spinor reection induces the reections for the irreducible spin

representation spaces

induced reections of lorentz group representa-
tion spaces

the generating structure of the two weyl representations induces c, p-reections
of sl( ic2)-representations spaces.

the complex nite dimensional irreducible representations of the group
sl( ic2) are characterized by two spins [2l|2r] with integer and halnteger

l, r = 0, 1

weyl left: [1|0] =  = e(i~+~)~, weyl right: [0|1] =  = e(i~~)~

[2l|2r] and [2r|2l] are equivalent with respect to the subgroup su(2)-repre-
sentations. the induced reections are given by the correponding products of
the weyl spinor reections.

the real representation spaces for the lorentz group so0(1, 3) are charac-

terized by integer spin

l + r = 0, 1, 2, . . .

they are all generated by the minkowski representation [1|1] =    where

the complex 4-dimensional representation space is decomposable into two real
4-dimensional ones, a hermitian and an antihermitian tensor

ic4 = wl  w t

r  l  l = z = x + i  ir4  iir4

with weyl spinor bases the induced linear reections for the minkowski
representation look as follows (with j = (12, ~) = j and j = (12,~) = j)

4.4 reections of spacetime fields

a eld  is a mapping from position space ir3 or, as relativistic eld, from
minkowski spacetime ir4 with values in a complex vector space v with the
action of a group g both on space(time) and on v . this denes the action of
the group on the eld  7 g   = g by the commutativity of the diagram

for position space the external action group is the euclidean group o(3) ~ir3,
for minkowski spacetime the poincare group o(1, 3) ~ ir4. the value space
may have additional interal action groups, e.g. u(1), su(2) and su(3) hy-
percharge, isospin and colour resp. in the standard model for quark and lepton
elds.

for pauli spinor elds on position space the o(3)-action has a direct su(2)-

factor and a reection factor ii(2)

5 the standard model breakdown of p and cp

a relativistic dynamics, characterized by a lagrangian for the elds involved,
may be invariant with respect to an operation group g, e.g. the c, p and t
reections, or not. a breakdown of the symmetry can occur in two dierent
ways: either the symmetry is represented on the eld value space v , but the
lagrangian is not g-invariant, or there does not even exist a g-representation
on v . both cases occur in the standard model for quark and lepton elds.

5.1 standard model breakdown of p

the charge u(1) vertex in electrodynamics for a dirac electron-positron eld
 interacting with an electromagnetic gauge eld j

jj = j(ljl + rjr)

is invariant under p and t if the elds have the weyl spinor induced behaviour
given above.

13

in the standard model of leptons[5] with a left handed isospin doublet eld
l and a right handed isospin singlet eld r the hypercharge u(1) and isospin
su(2) vertex with gauge elds aj and ~bj resp. and internal pauli matrices ~
reads

aj(lj 12

2 l + rjr) + ~bjlj ~

2 l

l = 13

all gauge elds are assumed with the spinor induced reection behaviour.
the p-invariance is broken in two dierent ways: one component of the lepton
isodoublet, e.g.

2 l  w l = ic2, can be used together with the right
handed isosinglet r as a basis of a dirac space   w l  wr = ic4 with a
representation of p. this is impossible for the remaining unpaired left handed
l = ic2 - here p cannot even be dened. however, also for the
eld 1+3
left-right pair (l, r) the resulting gauge vertex breaks position space reection
p invariance via the familiar neutral weak interactions, induced by a vector
eld zj arising in addition to the u(1)-electromagnetic gauge eld j

has to include also a linear reection of internal operation representations

with the spinor induced reection behaviour for the gauge elds the stan-
dard model for leptons, i.e. with internal hupercharge-isospin action, allows
the representation of gp and t with the gauge vertex above being gp and t
invariant.

5.3 cp-problems for quarks

if quark triplets and antitriplets which come with the dual dening su(3)-re-
presentations, are included in the standard model, an extended cp-reection
has to employ a linear reection  between dual representation spaces of colour
su(3), i.e. an su(3)-invariant bilinear form of the representation space



d(u)

u  u
y
y
u t  u t

d(u)



,

d : su(3)  gl(u) (colour representation)
1  d(u)t   = d(u1) for all u  su(3)

the situation for isospin su(2) and colour su(3) is completely dierent
with respect to the existence of such a linear dual isomorphism : all irre-
ducible su(2)-representations [2t ] with isospin t = 0, 1
2, 1, . . . have an - up
_ as product of the spinor

to a scalar factor - unique invariant bilinear form
metric, discussed above.

2t

that is not the case for the colour representations. some representations

are linearly selfdual, some are not.

the complex irreducible representations of su(3) are characterized by
[n1, n2] with two integers n1,2 = 0, 1, 2, . . .. they arise from the two fun-
damental triplet representations, dual to each other and parametrizable with
eight gell-mann matrices ~

triplet: [1, 0] = u = ei~~, antitriplet: [0, 1] = u = u1t = (ei~~)t
[n1, n2] acting on vector space u with dim ic u = (n1+1)(n2+1)(n1+n2+2)

15

dual representations have reected integer values [n1, n2]  [n2, n1]. only
those su(3)-representations whose weight diagram is central reection sym-
metric in the real 2-dimensional weight vector space (appendix) have one, and
only one, su(3)-invariant bilinear form[1], i.e. they are linearly selfdual. dual
representations have weights which are reected to each other

weights [n1, n2] 12 weights [n2, n1]

therefore, one obtains as selfdual irreducible su(3)-representations
weights [n1, n2] = weights [n1, n2]  n1 = n2 = n

 dim ic u = (n + 1)3 = 1, 8, 27, . . .
for the octet [1, 1] as adjoint su(3)-representation, the killing form

e.g.
denes its selfduality.

a general remark (appendix): the lie group sl( icr+1) with its maxi-
mal compact subgroup su(r + 1) of rank r is dened as invariance group of
the icr+1-volume elements which are totally antisymmetric (r + 1)-linear forms
a1...ar+1. their complex nite dimensional irreducible representations are char-
acterized by r integers [n1, . . . , nr] with the dual representations having the
reected order [nr, . . . , n1]. the weights (eigenvalues) for dual representations
are related to each other by the central weight space reection 1r which de-
nes the linear particle-antiparticle conjugation i for su(n). only for n = 2
(isospin su(2)) all representations [n = 2t ] are selfdual with their invariant
bilinear form arising from ab for [1]. the n = 2 selfduality of the doublet
u(2) = u(2) is replaced for n = 3 by the equivalence of antisymmetric triplet
square and antitriplet representation u(3)  u(3) = u(3), i.e. 3  3 = 3, with

r

the obvious generalization

obviously all su(r+1)-representations have an invariant sesquilinear form,
the su(r + 1) scalar product. however, this antilinear structure cannot dene
a linear particle-antiparticle conjugation.

^u(r + 1) = u(r + 1) for general rank r.

it is impossible to dene a cp-extending duality induced linear gp-reection
for the irreducible complex 3-dimensional quark representation spaces since
there does not exist a colour su(3)-invariant bilinear form of the triplet space

u = ic3. or equivalently: there does not exist a (33)-matrix  for the reec-
tion ~ = 1  ~t   of all eight gell-mann matrices. therewith there arise
also problems to dene an su(3)-compatible time reection for quark triplet
elds. could all that be the reason for the breakdown of cp-invariance coming
on the quark eld sector and its parametrization (e.g. cabibbo-kobayashi-
maskawa) with three families of colour triplets?

a central reections of lie algebras

a representation of a group g on a vector space v is selfdual if it is equivalent
to its dual representation, dened by the inversed transposed action on the
linear forms v t

d : g  gl(v t ) ) ,
d : g  gl(v )

d(g) = d(g1)t

16

i.e. if the following diagram with a linear or antilinear isomorphism  : v 
v t commutes with the action of all group elements



d(g)

v  v
y
y
v t  v t

d(g)



,

1  d(g)t   = d(g1) for all g  g

selfduality is equivalent to the existence of a nondegenerate bilinear (for linear
) or sesquilinear form (for antilinear ) of the vector space v

v  v  ic, (w, v) = h(w), vi

selfdual (g  w, g  v) = (w, v), g  v = d(g).v

for the lie algebra l = log g of a lie group g with dual representa-
tions in the endomorphism algebras al(v ) and al(v t ) which are negative
transposed to each other

d : l  al(v t ) ) ,
d : l  al(v )

d(l) = d(l)t

a selfduality isomorphism, i.e. the reection v

(l  w, v) = (w, l  v),

 v t fullls
l  v = d(l).v

and denes the central reection of the lie algebra in the representation



d(l)

v  v
y
y
v t  v t

d(l)



, 1  d(l)t   = d(l) for all l  log g

with schurs lemma, an irreducible complex nite dimensional representa-
tion of a group or lie algebra can have at most - up to a constant - one invariant
bilinear and one invariant sesquilinear form. e.g. pauli spinors for su(2) have
both, ab (bilinear) and ab (sesquilinear, scalar product), a, b = 1, 2, quark
triplets have only a scalar product ab, a, b = 1, 2, 3, weyl spinors for sl( ic2)
have only the bilinear metric ab.

for a simple lie algebra l of rank r, the weights (eigenvalue vectors for a
cartan subalgebra) of dual representations d and d are related to each other
by the central reection of the weight vector space irr
weightsd[l] 1r weights d[l]

17

which may be induced by a linear isomorphism  of the dual representation
spaces. therewith: such a linear isomorphism for an l-representation exists[1]
if, and only if, the weights of the representation d : l  al(v ) are invariant
under central reection

v

 v t  weightsd[l] = weightsd[l]
