abstract. using the chern-simon formulation of (2+1) gravity, we derive, for the gen-
eral asymptotic metrics given by the feerman-graham-lee theorems, the emergence of the
liouville mode associated to the boundary degrees of freedom of (2+1) dimensional anti de
sitter geometries.

introduction

the interest of studying (2+1) dimensional gravity has initially been emphasized in [1]
and has recently been revived with the discovery of black holes in spaces with negative
cosmological constant [2]. since then, a large number of studies has been devoted to
the elucidation of classical as well as to quantum (2+1) gravity.

in particular, we examined [3] stellar-like models corresponding to stationary, rota-
tionally symmetric gravitational sources of the perfect uid type, embedded in spaces
of arbitrary cosmological constant, and showed how causality privileges anti de sitter
(ads) backgrounds. as this part of the talk has already been published, we will not
re-describe it here.

on the other hand, (2 + 1) gravity with negative cosmological constant has been
proven to be equivalent to chern-simons (cs) theory with sl(2, ir)  sl(2, ir) as
gauge group [4]. assuming the boundary of the space to be a at cylinder ir  s1,
coussaert, henneaux and van driel (chd) [5] demonstrated the equivalence between
this cs theory and a non-chiral wess-zumino-witten (wzw) theory [6], and showed
that the ads3 boundary conditions as dened in [7] implement the constraints that
reduce the wzm model to the liouville theory [8].

in this short note, we show that, using the less restrictive ads boundary condi-
tions deduced from the feerman-graham-lee theorems [9, 10], the chd analysis can

be extended and leads to the liouville theory formulated on a 2-dimensional curved
background. a detailed version of this work will be found in [12].

2 asymptotically anti de sitter spaces

graham and lee [9] proved that, under suitable topological assumptions, euclidean
einstein spaces with negative cosmological constant  are completely dened by the
geometry on their boundary. furthermore, feerman and graham [10] showed that,
whatever the signature, there exists a formal asymptotic expansion of the metric, which
formally solves the einstein equations with  < 0. the rst terms of this expansion
are given by even powers of a radial coordinate r:

ds2



r  

2 dr2

r2 +

r2
2

(0)
g (xi) +

(2)
g (xi) +   

.

(1)

on d-dimensional space-times, the full asymptotic expansion actually continues with
terms of negative even powers of r up to r2([ d
2 ]2), with in addition a logarithmic
term of the order of r(d3) log r when d is odd and larger than 3. all these terms
are completely dened by the boundary geometry. they are followed by terms of all
negative powers starting from r(d3); the trace-free part of the r(d3) coecient is

not fully determined by

(0)
g but contains degrees of freedom [11].

it is instructive to look at the rst iterations of this expansion to see the special
character of 3 dimensions. we therefore write the metric in terms of forms  as
ds2 = 0  0 + ab a  b with ,  [resp. a, b] running from 0 to n [resp. 1 to
n] and ab a at n-dimensional minkowskian metric diag.(1,..., 1, -1). the forms 
read as:

0 =

here and in what follows, the n-dimensional indices and the covariant derivatives are

dened with respect to the metric

clearly reveal the pecularity of 3-dimensional spaces. indeed, when n 6= 2, eq. (6)

g and eq. (7) becomes the bianchi identity satised by the
fully species the metric
n-dimensional einstein tensor. if we moreover require the space to be asymptotically
ads, the nite terms in eqs (4-5) have to vanish, thereby implying the n-dimensional
geometry to be conformally at.

on the contrary, when n = 2, only the trace of

(2)
g is xed by eq. (6):

and the other components of

the subdominant metric components are thus not all determined by the asymptotic
metric in 3 dimensions, but there remains one degree of freedom, which we shall
explicit in the next section. note that in 3 dimensions einstein spaces with  < 0 are
locally ads and metrics on cylindrical boundaries are conformally at; this implies
the equivalence between eqs (6,7) and the vanishing of the sub-dominant terms on the
right-hand side of eqs (4,5).

3 from einstein-hilbert to liouville action

the einstein-hilbert (eh) (2+1) gravity action with  < 0 is equivalent to the dier-
ence of two cs actions scs[a]  scs[ a] with

scs[a] =

the gauge elds a = a = j a, with j generators of the sl(2, ir) algebraa, are
given as functions of the 3-bein  and the levi-civita connection form  by:

in cylindrical coordinates {r, , t}, the cs action may be written as:

scs[a] =

t r(2 atfr + a ar  ar a) dr d dt + sb[a]

where m stands for bulk. the on-shell variation of this action is given by:

scs[a] =

2zm

t r(ata  aat) d dt

.

the asymptotic behaviour of the elds a and a, dictated by the ads3 boundary
conditions, are easily expressed using the null frame  = 1 2 and its dual vectorial
2 (~e1  ~e2). indeed, the null components a and a+ do not contain any
frame ~e = 1

degrees of freedom, i.e. they only depend on the metric

g . this implies that
depend on the dynamical part of
a = o(r2) =  a+ and aa+ = o(r2) = a+ a. so, rewriting the variation
of the action (14) in terms of null components yields:

t r(a+a  aa+)  d dt =zm

with  = +
 . it is thus easy to see that, owing to the boundary conditions
(15,16), the variation of the action ssc vanishes, without the addition of any extra
boundary term. however, as the practical implementation of the boundary condition
(16) is not obvious at this stage, we prefer to modify the action by the addition of the
boundary term

s 

b[a] =

t r(a a+)  d dt

(18)

which ensures that (scs[a] + s 
(16). a similar modication is applied to the a sector.

b[a]) = 0 independently of the boundary condition

furthermore, the time components at and at play the role of lagrange multipliers
and can be eliminated from the bulk action by solving the constraint equations fr = 0
and fr = 0 as ai = q1
2 iq2, with i = (r, ). the asymptotic

ads3 behaviour (2) implies that the sl(2, ir)/z2 group elements q1 and q2 asymptot-
ically factorize into q1(r, , t) = q1(, t)h(r) and q2(r, , t) = q2(, t)h(r)1, with

h(r) = diag.(pr/,p/r). on the other hand, the components at and at in the

boundary action sb may be eliminated in terms of a, a, k and k+, using the
boundary conditions (15), which can be re-expressed as:

at =

(e

at =

(e

.

(19)

these relations allow to write the complete action s = ssc [a]+s [a]ssc[ a]s [ a]
as:

s = [q1]+

where + and  are derivatives along the vectors ~e+ and ~e, q = q1q, k =
hkh 1, k+ = h 1 k+h and [q] = 1

using the new variable q = q1

1 q2, the elds q1 or q2 can be eliminated using their
equations of motion, as they only appear in quadratic expressions of their derivatives
with respect to the angular variable . the resulting action becomes a non-chiral
wzw-like action containing only the eld q:

3!r t r[q1dq  q1dq  q1dq].

s = [q]

using the gauss decomposition q = (cid:18) e/2 + xy e/2 xe/2

(26)

this is the liouville equation on curved background, the curvature being given by eq.

as a consequence, q can be expressed in terms of  and its derivatives only. note that
the elimination of the x and y variables in the non-chiral wzw action (21), using
the constants of motion dened by eqs (25), has to be performed following the same
trick as the one that leads to the maupertuis action in classical mechanics when the
energy is conserved. this yields the equivalent action dened on the boundary only
(without any remaing bulk terms):

which is the liouville action. let us emphasize that the curvature term appearing

here comes directly from its denition in terms of the asymptotic metric
through  as it is the case in eq. (26).

g , and not

to conclude, we would like to emphasize several points. first, the usual eh action

is divergent and equal to scs[a]  scs[ a] plus an additional term 
a], which is equal to half of the extrinsic curvature term usually added to the eh
action to cancel its variation [13]. however, owing to the ads boundary conditions,
this additional term does not contain any dynamical degrees of freedom and may be
dropped, thereby rendering the resulting action nite. furthermore, the developments
following eq. (20), which lead from the non-chiral wzw action to the liouville action
(29), are classically valid, but have to be re-examined in the framework of quantum
mechanics.
indeed, in quantum mechanics, the changes of variables leading to eq.
(21) and the subsequent elimination of the x and y variables in terms of  involve
functional determinants that have been completely ignored.
