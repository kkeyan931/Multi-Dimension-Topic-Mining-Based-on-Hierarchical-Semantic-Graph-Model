abstract

in this paper we describe a liouville gravity which is induced by a set of quantum
elds (constituents) and represents a two-dimensional analog of sakharovs induced
gravity. the important feature of the considered theory is the presence of massless
constituents which are responsible for the appearance of the induced liouville eld.
the role of the massive constituents is only to induce the cosmological constant. we
consider the instanton solutions of the euclidean liouville gravity with negative and
zero cosmological constants, some instantons being interpreted as two-dimensional
anti-de sitter ads2 black holes. we study thermodynamics of all the solutions and
conclude that their entropy is completely determined by the statistical-mechanical
entropy of the massless constituents. this shows, in particular, that the constituents
of the induced gravity are the true degrees of freedom of ads2 black holes. spe-
cial attention is also paid to the induced liouville gravity with zero cosmological
constant on a torus. we demonstrate the equivalence of its thermodynamics to the
thermodynamics of btz black holes and comment on computations of the btz
black hole entropy.

1 introduction

the microscopic explanation of the bekenstein-hawking entropy [1],[2] of black holes is
one of the most intriguing problems of theoretical physics. although there are several
approaches to its resolution (for a review of some of them see [3],[4]) this problem is a
subject of intensive study and continues to inspire new ideas.

in particular, it was realized recently that at least some black holes may be macro-
scopically equivalent to two-dimensional systems described by a liouville theory. the
statistical-mechanical entropy of these systems can be computed by means of a conformal
eld theory and coincides with the black hole entropy.

this observation was rst made for extremal black holes [5] and was based on dualities
in string models. however, in the most explicit and simple form it appeared in the
work by strominger [6] concerning btz black holes [7] (for a detailed analysis of these
computations with the large list of references see [10]). the btz black holes have the same
thermodynamic characteristics as a dual liouville theory dened at asymptotic innity.
the reason for such a relation arises from a specic property of three-dimensional gravity
with negative cosmological constant. it is equivalent to a chern-simons theory which has
only boundary degrees of freedom that are described by a liouville theory [8],[9].

a liouville theory which is dual to the btz black hole can be also dened at the black
hole horizon [11]. moreover, close to the horizon one can nd a liouville-like description
of black holes in an arbitrary dimension [12],[13]. this description becomes possible
because the gravitational action for spherically symmetric metrics is the action for a two-
dimensional dilatonic gravity. in the region near the horizon this gravity is equivalent to
a liouville theory [13] and one can use the conformal theory to calculate the entropy.

these results may have the following interpretation [14]. on the level of thermody-
namics black holes are equivalent to a liouville eld theory. the liouville eld, which
is purely classical, is a collective excitation of some quantum constituents which are de-
scribed by 2d conformal eld theory. to put it in another way, the liouville theory is
an eective theory of the constituents. the constituents are those microscopic degrees of
freedom which explain the thermodynamic entropy related to the liouville eld and thus
reproduce the black hole entropy in a statistical-mechanical way.

remarkably, this mechanism is basically the same as the mechanism of the generation
of the black hole entropy in sakharovs induced gravity [17][20]. according to sakharovs
idea [21], the gravitational eld is a collective excitation of the matter constituents and
the einstein action is the low-energy eective action of the constituents. the equations
for the metric g are

here t is the stress-energy tensor of constituent elds on the background with the metric
g and its average is taken in some quantum state.

h t(g)i = 0 .

(1.1)

it should be noted that in sakharovs induced gravity the microscopic states of a

2

black hole are related to the constituents which live on the physical space-time. in the
liouville description of black holes the microscopic degrees of freedom live on a dual two-
dimensional space-time. for this reason the statistical origin of the bekenstein-hawking
entropy in the two approaches is dierent.

nevertheless, the similarity of both approaches suggests that they may be connected.
to see whether there is any connection one must rst understand better how sakharovs
mechanism of induced gravity works in the case of the liouville theory. studying induced
liouville gravity is the subject of this paper.

the important feature of the considered models of two-dimensional induced gravity
is the presence of massless constituents which induce the liouville action. the massive
constituents serve only to induce a nite cosmological constant. thus, as distinct from
higher dimensions, all the dynamics in the liouville induced gravity is due to massless
elds. this fact has a crucial consequence for the statistical interpretation of the thermo-
dynamics of the instanton solutions of the theory.

we consider models with negative and zero cosmological constants. the theory with
negative cosmological constant is a sort of gravity on anti-de sitter ads2 space-time.
studying this theory is motivated by various reasons, one of which is its relation to ads2
string theories arising as near-horizon limits of dierent four and ve-dimensional black
holes (for a recent discussion of ads2 gravity in this context see [15]). the liouville
induced gravity with vanishing cosmological constant is interesting because it is that
theory which is thermodynamically equivalent to btz black holes.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we use the sakharovs mechanism to
induce liouville gravity by massless and massive quantum constituent elds. the consid-
ered quantum models are free from ultraviolet divergences and, as a result, the induced
theory is nite and well-dened. all the solutions of liouville gravity with the nega-
tive cosmological constant are locally ads2. in the euclidean theory they can be of three
types: elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic. we remind the reader the form of these solutions
in section 3. the instantons of the elliptic type can be interpreted as ads2 black holes.
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of these black holes is studied in section 4.
we demonstrate that in the physical processes the changes of the entropy of a ads2 black
hole coincide with the corresponding changes of the entanglement (statistical-mechanical)
entropy of the massless constituents. therefore, the constituents of the induced gravity
are the true internal degrees of freedom of ads2 black hole. in section 5 we comment on
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics the hyperbolic and parabolic solutions. finally,
in section 6 we consider induced liouville gravity with vanishing cosmological constant
on a torus and demonstrate the equivalence of its thermodynamics to the thermodynam-
ics of the btz black hole under identifying the central charges of both theories. a brief
discussion is given in section 7.

2 induced liouville gravity

induced liouville gravity (ilg) can be constructed from models with dierent constituent
eld species, similar to the construction of induced einstein gravity [18]-[20]. to illustrate
the idea we consider here the simplest model.
it consists of noninteracting scalar and
spinor elds, with some of the scalar elds being massless. the numbers of massive and
massless scalars are ns and n, respectively, and the number of massive spinor elds is nd.
it is assumed that some massive scalars are non-minimally coupled and the corresponding
constants are denoted as s. the eective gravitational action of the elds propagating
on a background with the metric g is

here r is the scalar curvature of the background. it is not dicult to show that  is free
from ultraviolet divergences if the following constraints are satised

s = 0 .

constraints (2.4) ensure the niteness of the induced cosmological constant, while condi-
tion (2.5) guarantees the niteness of the induced newton constant.

suppose now that masses mi have the order of magnitude of a typical mass m. the
low-energy limit of the theory is realized when the curvature of the background geometry
is small compared to m 2. in this limit contributions of the massive constituents to the
induced action can be expanded in powers of the curvature. on the other hand, the
contributions of the massless constituents, w 0

s , can be calculated exactly.

it is convenient to represent the induced action in the form

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

here w 0
s,div is the divergent part of the action of massless elds, so that w is the renor-
malized action. note that because we are dealing with ultraviolet nite theories the
functionals m are free from the divergences. the divergences of the massive elds in m
are canceled by the term nw 0

s,div.

let us consider elds given on a manifold m with boundary m. the metric on m
will be denoted g. in the general case, g can have lorentzian or euclidean signature.
in the low energy limit
in what follows we assume that m is a euclidean manifold.
of the theory the action of the massive constituents m can be expanded in powers of
the curvature. we keep only the leading (cosmological) term in this decomposition and
approximate m as

here the cosmological constant  is

m = zm

in what follows, we consider only the models where the cosmological constant is negative
or zero. the curvature corrections to expression (2.9) are suppressed by powers rm 2.
the above approximation is not applicable to the action w of massless elds. in fact,
this functional is the well-known polyakov action [22] which can be computed exactly.
consider the conformal map of m onto a space m with the metric g = exp(2)g.
the actions on m and m are related as
w [g] = w [g] 
(2.11)
here n is a unit vector normal to the boundary m of m; k and h are the extrinsic
curvature and the metric on m. the functional w [g] is the eective action computed
on the background m with the metric g. it is convenient to assume that m is locally
at.

as follows from the above analysis, the induced gravitational action after subtracting

a boundary term depending on n, can be written in the form:

1strictly speaking, il[] diers from the standard denition by a sign, see [24].

5

liouville theory is known from the last century as a theory of negatively curved surfaces.
a review of some its properties can be found in [23],[24]. the important feature of (2.16)
is that it describes a classical conformal theory with the central charge

c =

12
2

,

which in our model is just the number of massless constituents

c = n ,

(2.17)

(2.18)

see (2.15). the latter fact is not surprising. the massless constituents of our model are
conformally invariant in two dimensions. under quantization the conformal symmetry ac-
quires a central extension due to the conformal anomaly. the central charge c corresponds
to this anomaly.

3 solutions to the liouville theory

equation (2.16) shows that the liouville eld is the only dynamical variable of induced
liouville gravity2. by varying il with xed boundary value of , one nds the equation

e  = 


2

.

(3.1)

it follows from this equation that the physical metric g = eg corresponds to a space
with constant negative curvature3 r = /2. this space is locally a two-dimensional
lobachevsky space h2. the corresponding solution in the lorentzian space-time is locally
anti-de sitter (ads2).

there is also another approach to the variational problem. one can start with the
functional (2.12) and consider the liouville eld and metric g as independent variables.
then the equations of motion obtained from (2.12) by varying4  and g respectively,
are:

r =  ,

g = 0 ,

(3.4)

2to avoid the confusion, let us note that  is the dynamical variable only in the classical theory, in
the quantum liouville theory  appears in the conformal gauge but its contribution is compensated by
the contribution of corresponding ghosts.

3it should be noted that r = /2 results in further restrictions on the parameters of the constituent
elds of the polyakov induced gravity. namely, the condition of the large masses, m 2  r, becomes
m 2  48||/n where m is a typical scale for masses of the elds and  is given by eq. (2.10). one
can construct models where this condition is satised.
4the variational procedure implies that the metric and  are xed on the boundary. the boundary
term which depends on n, was removed from induced action (2.12) in order to obey this requirement.

6

the trace of eq.(3.3) results in the relation

 = 


2

(3.5)

which coincides with the liouville equation (3.1). this justies considering the more
general variational problem where  and the metric are independent elds.

when  obeys (3.1)

g = 4h ti

,

(3.6)

where t is the quantum stress-energy tensor of the constituents computed in the con-
sidered approximation (3.2). thus, (3.3) is equivalent to relation (1.1) of the sakharovs
induced gravity. it should be noted that boundary conditions for  which are required to
solve for it from (3.2) are related to the choice of the quantum state 5.

there is three types of solutions of the euclidean liouville equations (3.1): elliptic,
parabolic and hyperbolic (see, e.g. [24]). these solutions correspond to dierent coordi-
nate maps on the lobachevsky space h2.

this solution has the topology of a disk and can be interpreted as a black hole instanton.
the horizon of the black hole is located at x = 0 ( = 0). the normalization of the time
coordinate  is chosen so that the corresponding surface gravity constant is g(0)/2 = 1.
one can make the surface gravity equal to another constant by rescaling  .

the black hole solutions in the lorentzian metric have the anti-de sitter geometry

and we will call them ads2 black holes for the brevity.

5a detailed discussion of this problem can be found for instance in ref. [25].

    +, where  > 0 and + < 1. in the limit when  = 0 the curvature of the
solution has a delta-function-like singularity. the metric (3.17) can be also written in the
form (3.10) with

g =

(3.18)

(3.19)

as follows from (3.18) these solutions are analogous to extremal black holes.

note that liouville solutions of all three types have the same asymptotic behaviour
at large x. it is also worth pointing out that each liouville solution can be interpreted
as a boundary theory of a three-dimensional ads-gravity and corresponds to a particular
three dimensional object [14] 7. elliptic solutions with conical singularities correspond
to massive particles in ads3, hyperbolic and parabolic solutions may be related to non-
extreme and extreme three-dimensional black holes, respectively. the non-extreme black
holes correspond to a particular liouville theory on a torus.

7it is interesting to note that in a 4d gravity there also exist 3 dierent families of schwarzschild-
(anti) de sitter solutions. these solutions are given by metric ds2 = a dt2 + dr2/a + r2 d2, where
a = k  (2m/r) + r2/3, d2 = d2 + sinn2 d2. for an elliptic case, k = 1 and sinn  = sin . for a
hyperbolic case, k = 1 and sinn  = sinh . for a parabolic case, k = 0 and sinn  = . the elliptic
solution (with k = 1) corresponds to a usual black hole. the hyperbolic solution describes a black hole
moving with a superluminar velocity, while the hyperbolic solution describes a black hole moving with
the velocity of light.

4 elliptic solutions

4.1 thermodynamics of ads2 black holes

let us now study black holes corresponding to elliptic solutions. it is perhaps necessary
at this stage to explain in what sense we expect constant curvature solutions to behave
like black holes. the key assumption that we make is that the liouville eld  is an
observable quantity, despite the fact that it is not, strictly speaking, a fundamental eld.
it is rather introduced for calculational convenience to make the eective action local and
dened formally by the relationship  = 1
 r(g). in eect, the observability of  requires
matter to couple non-locally to the metric g (i.e. to 1
 r). this does not occur at the
classical level, but in the full quantum eective action one does expect such terms to
appear. it is on this basis that we feel justied in assuming that  is an observable eld,
analogous to a dilaton. henceforth we treat the liouville action as if it were a dilaton
gravity theory of the general form considered extensively in a variety of references[16]8.

we will interpret the induced euclidean action (2.12) considered on the elliptic solution
(3.7) as t times the free energy of the corresponding black hole. the black hole is
completely characterized by the temperature t measured at the boundary x = x+

this condition denes x+ in terms of t

t = (2qg(x+))1/2

.

x+ =

1

t (cid:18)q(4t )2 +   4t(cid:19) .

the liouville action on the elliptic solution is

il(x+) = 


22 x+ .

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

to calculate the induced action (2.12) one also has to know the value of the polyakov
action on the disk of the radius +. the dependence of this action on + can be found
out by making a scaling transformation (i.e. a conformal transformation with constant
factor) to the disk of unit radius

nw [g(+)] = 

2
2 ln + + c .

(4.4)

8 it is worth noting that there exists at least one other theory, namely jackiw-teitelboim gravity, in
which constant curvature black hole solutions have been analyzed in some detail. in that case, the black
holes can be interpreted in terms of dimensionally reduced 2+1 einstein gravity (the so-called btz black
holes[7]). interestingly, the jackiw-teitelboim theory was originally motivated by the connection between
constant curvature metrics and induced liouville gravity. the dilaton was considered to be a physically
irrelevant lagrange multiplier eld needed to enforce the constant curvature equation. once the dilaton is
taken seriously, it becomes clear that jackiw-teitelboim gravity and induced liouville gravity are quite
dierent theories, despite the fact that the solutions to both involve constant curvature metrics.

9

here c is a constant corresponding to the action on the unit disk. it does not depend on
t and can be omitted. from (3.12), (4.3) and (4.4) we obtain for (2.12)

(4.5)

this result can be immediately expressed in terms of the temperature on the boundary
by using (4.1) and (4.2). by neglecting in (4.5) a numerical constant we nd the free
energy of the black hole

f bh(t ) = t (x+)|x+=x+(t ) = 

1

2 (cid:20) 1

2q(4t )2 +  + 2t ln(cid:18)q(4t )2 +   4t(cid:19)(cid:21)

.

(4.6)

thus, the black hole entropy dened by the standard relation, is

sbh(t ) =

2 ln(cid:18)q(4t )2 +   4t(cid:19) .

(here all numerical constants were omitted.) the energy corresponding to this solution
is

(4.8)

(4.9)

ebh(t ) =

22q(4t )2 +  .

the variations of the energy and the entropy are related by the rst law

debh = t dsbh .

it should be noted that the given thermodynamical system is not stable because its heat
capacity is negative for all values of t

c(t ) = t

(4.10)

the energy of this black hole decreases when its temperature grows.
increasing the
temperature corresponds to moving the boundary closer to the black hole horizon (x+ 
0).

as follows from (4.10) the heat capacity is increasing at small temperatures and one
may speculate that in this region the black hole may be in a quasi-equilibrium state. thus
at low temperatures our description of the black hole in terms of a canonical ensemble
may be justied. on the other hand, at high temperatures t the system is very unstable
and one should expect a phase transition. other possible phases of the theory may be
related to other solutions of ilg.

10

4.2 black hole statistical mechanics

a. black hole canonical ensemble in terms of the constituents

we now show how the black hole can be described in terms of statistical mechanics
of the constituents of ilg. to this aim let us consider the constituents which propagate
in the static region of the black hole, outside the horizon, and compare the canonical
ensembles of the black hole and the constituents.

it is well known that the description of statistical-mechanics in the presence of a killing
horizon meets diculties due to the divergences of the density of states near the horizon
[3]. the standard method to proceed in this situation is to introduce a cuto near the
horizon at some proper distance . this cuto can be considered as an inner boundary.
then the regularized free energy f (, t ) of the constituents has the standard denition

ef/t = tre( h ev)/t

,

(4.11)

where t is the temperature of the system. the operator h is normally ordered total
hamiltonian of all the constituents, and ev is the zero-point energy. in our approach the
massive constituents are very heavy and contribute only to the cosmological constant. it
means that in the considered approximation all the eect of these elds is in the vacuum
energy ev. thus, one can rewrite (4.11) as

ef/t = eev /t (cid:16)tre h0/t(cid:17)n

= e(ev n f0)/t

,

(4.12)

where h0 and f0 are, respectively, the normally ordered hamiltonian and the statistical-
mechanical free energy of a single massless constituent.

it is also instructive to represent the free energy (4.11) of the constituents in another
form, in terms of the induced euclidean action (x+, , t ). the euclidean theory is
formulated on the elliptic solution (3.7) with an inner boundary at  determined by the
cuto,

  e/2

,

(4.13)

where  is the value of the liouville eld at this boundary ( is a nite constant at
  0). the both functionals are related as

(x+, , t ) + c = f (, t )t 1

,

(4.14)

where c is a possible nite numerical constant which accounts for, according to [27], the
dierence between eld-theoretical and statistical-mechanical computations. x+ in (4.14)
is expressed in terms of t by (4.2). the induced action is determined by (2.12),

(x+, , t ) = il(x+, , t ) + nw [k]

.

the action w [k] is the polyakov action on the annulus k

because of the conformal invariance the spectrum of single particle excitations of two-
dimensional massless scalars coincides with the spectrum of these elds on related at
ultrastatic space (4.17) (see for the details, e.g., [3])). as a result of this property, the
eective action on the cylinder is related to the statistical-mechanical free energy of a
single massless constituent in a simple way

t w [qb] = f0(, t )

.

(4.21)

equations (4.12), (4.14), (4.15) and (4.21) enable us to nd the expression for the vacuum

the parameter  coincides with the periodicity of the euclidean time  in (4.17). in
our case  = 2. by taking into account that the physical temperature is t one can write

f0(, t ) = 2t f sm(b, 2)

.

(4.26)

12

this relation in combination with (4.12), (4.23)(4.25) gives the following result

f (, t ) = e(, t )  t s(, t )

,

e(, t ) = ev(, t ) + 2nt esm(b, 2) = t il(x+) + ct ,

s(, t ) = nssm(b, 2)

.

(4.27)

(4.28)

(4.29)

note that the total energy e(, t ) is nite in the limit   0 because the divergence of
zero-point uctuations is compensated by the divergence of the thermal excitations of the
massless constituents. moreover, by using (4.2) and (4.3) we nd that

ebh (t ) = e(0, t ) + ct ,

(4.30)

where c is a numerical constant. by using an arbitrariness in relation (4.14) between
the euclidean action and the free energy one can always make c equal to 0. after
this normalization the statistical-mechanical energy of the induced gravity constituents
coincide with black hole energy (4.8).

let us consider now the entropy of the constituents. because this quantity corresponds
to the elds propagating outside the horizon it can be interpreted as the entanglement
entropy. as is well known, the entanglement entropy is divergent when the cuto is
removed. this is its key distinction from the black hole entropy sbh. however, as follows
from (4.7), (4.24) and (4.29), the two entropies are related9,

sbh(t ) = s(, t )  sr()

,

.

(4.31)

(4.32)

it is not dicult to see that sr() can be interpreted as the entropy of the constituents
on the rindler space with the same cuto

ds2 = 2d 2 + d2 ,

 <   1 , 0    2 .

(4.33)

it is important that if one considers variations of the parameters of the black hole at xed
value of the parameter , changes of entropy (4.29) coincide with changes of thermody-
namical entropy (4.7) of a black hole

sbh (t ) = s(, t )

.

(4.34)

thus, from the point of view of thermodynamics the two entropies are equivalent. more-
over, the above relation does not depend on the choice of the regularization prescription.
instead of using the cuto near the horizon one can arrive at (4.34) using the dimensional

9an analogous subtraction formula for two-dimensional black holes was discussed in [26]. however,
that paper was dealing with quantum corrections to the black hole entropy rather than to the entropy
itself.

or pauli-villars regularization schemes which also enable one to eliminate the divergences
related to the horizon (see for details, e. g. [3]).

the analysis of this section demonstrates that the thermodynamics of ads2 black
hole has a statistical-mechanical explanation in terms of the constituents of ilg. one
can conclude that the constituents are the real degrees of freedom of the black hole. it
is interesting to point out the black hole entropy is related to the massless constituents
only.
it does not mean, however, that the massive elds are irrelevant. as we saw,
these constituents provide the nite cosmological constant and give a contribution to the
vacuum energy which depends on the black hole parameters.

b. conformal eld theory

the above result for the entropy can be computed by means of a conformal eld theory
(cft) along the lines of computations of the entropy of btz black holes [6]. massless
constituents of ilg are described by a cft with the central charge c = n, see (2.17).

the computation of the entropy is as follows [28],[29]. the relation between the hamil-
tonian of the system and generators of the virasoro algebra follow from the representation
of the metric (4.17) in the form

ds2 =   b

consequently,

(4.35)

(4.36)

(4.37)

in (4.35) the coordinate z ranges from 0 to . this corresponds to a theory on an interval
where the points z = 0 and z =  are independent. in order to carry out the computations
it is convenient to pass to a theory where z is a periodic coordinate. this can be done
if one considers two equivalent cfts on the intervals with the length  and makes from
them a cft on a circle by gluing together the ends of the intervals.
in the obtained
theory z has the periodicity 2.

one has two copies of the virasoro algebra where the elements ln and ln can be
dened in a standard way as the generators of the coordinate transformations, u = einu
and v = einv, respectively. as a result of relation (4.37), the hamiltonian of massless
constituents which generates transformations along the killing time t coincides with the
operator (l0  l0)/2b. similarly, translations of the system along y are generated by
the momentum (l0 + l0)/2b. because the system is at rest the average momentum is
zero. on the other hand, the average value of the energy is nesm(b, ). this xes the
average values h and h of l0 and l0, respectively. in the leading approximation

h = h =

n

.

14

(4.38)

in the limit when b is large ( goes to zero), h  1 and one can use cardys formula to
estimate the degeneracy of l0 and l0. in this approximation the total degeneracy d is

ln d = 2s ch

6

+ 2s c|h|

and by taking into account that in our case the central charge c = n we nd

ln d = 2n

.

(4.39)

(4.40)

finally, we have to remember that d is the number of states of the system with the doubled
hilbert space which results from the trick of imposing periodicity of the coordinate z. the
real number of states of the system we are interested in is d. thus, the entropy is

ln d = nssm

2

(4.41)

and it coincides exactly with the required value in eq. (4.24) for n elds.

a remark concerning xing of the virasoro level is in order. in our calculation the
eigenvalues h, h are not connected with the observable energy (4.8) of a black hole but
are determined by the average value of the normally ordered hamiltonian, i.e., by the
thermal energy of the elds.

5 hyperbolic and parabolic solutions

it is also worth studying thermodynamics of parabolic and hyperbolic instantons of ilg.
below we briey comment on its features.

the solutions have two boundaries, and the ducial space m in the both cases (see
(3.13) and (3.17)) is an annulus. for this reason there are no diculties related to the
horizon as in the case of ads2 black holes. this automatically provides the agreement
between thermodynamics of the solutions and statistical mechanics of the constituents.
to begin with it is convenient to replace the ducial space m in (2.12) to a cylinder by
making coordinate and conformal transformations and changing the liouville eld. then
(3.13) and (3.17) can be written as

ds2 = eds2

ds2 = d 2 + dy2

restrictions y > 0 and y+ < . for the parabolic solution

e =

y2

(5.5)

where y+ < 0. in this case  is an arbitrary parameter. in fact, the parabolic metric does
not change when one rescales the coordinates y and  with the same coecient. thus one
can choose any periodicity for  by appropriate redenition of the boundary values y.

the induced action (2.12) for hyperbolic and parabolic solutions has a very simple
form because the polyakov action on the cylinder (5.2) is determined by the statistical-
mechanical free energy (4.23) at the temperature  1 on the interval of the length b =
y+  y

w (y+  y, ) = f sm(y+  y, )

.

(5.6)

note, as we explained in the previous section, f sm(y+  y, ) coincides with the free

energy of a single massless scalar constituent of ilg. one can represent the induced action
(2.12) in the form

(y+, y, ) = hf (y+)  f (y) + nf sm(y+  y, )i

.

(5.7)

the function f (y) can be easily found by calculating the liouville action (2.16) for the
given solutions. one has

f (y) =

1

2 (cid:18)4 cot y + 2y 


2

(y)(cid:19)

for the hyperbolic solution, and

f (y) =

1

2   4
y 


2

(y)!

(5.8)

(5.9)

for the parabolic one. as follows from these expressions, the parabolic action is a limiting
form of the hyperbolic functional at the small values of y.

the thermodynamics of these solutions is the thermodynamics of a system in a nite
volume. the corresponding thermodynamical state is xed by the boundary values y
which characterize the size of the system and the temperature t measured at one of
the boundaries. the free energy is determined by the induced action (5.7) as usually,
f (t, y+, y) = t (, y+, y). the inverse temperature t 1 is the circumference length
of the boundary and is proportional to . thus, one immediately concludes from (5.7)
that the thermodynamical entropy coincides with the statistical entropy of the massless
constituents of ilg

where

s(t, y+, y) = nssm(, y+  y)
s(t, y+, y) =   f (t, y+, y)

and ssm is dened in (4.24). the equality (5.10) is more strong than relation (4.34) for
the elliptic solutions.

to conclude this section we should note that the rst law for the hyperbolic and the

parabolic solutions has a more general form

where

e = t s  p+y+  py ,

e = f + t s

6 ilg dual to btz black holes

our discussion includes as a particular example the induced liouville gravity which is
dual to the btz black hole sector of the three-dimensional gravity with the negative
cosmological constant (ads3 gravity). the euclidean action of this theory [30]

i (3) =

16g (cid:20)z d3xg(r +

2

l2 ) +z

d2xhk(cid:21)

,

(6.1)

where k is the extrinsic curvature of the asymptotic boundary, corresponds to a canonical
free energy of the system. let us consider for simplicity a static btz black hole with the
mass m. functional (6.1) taken on the corresponding instanton has the canonical form

i (3) = m bt z  sbt z

,

(6.2)

where  and sbt z are the inverse temperature and the entropy of the black hole, re-
spectively. the parameters of the black hole are determined by the radius r+ of the
horizon

,

.

(6.4)

(6.5)

m bt z =

it is instructive to represent the free energy, entropy and mass of the black hole in terms
of the inverse temperature

(6.7)

(6.8)

let us now demonstrate that this black hole is thermodynamically equivalent to a certain
type of ilg. we begin with euclidean ilg with zero cosmological constant ( = 0) which
is a particular case of ilg models. the boundary of a euclidean btz black hole is a
torus, see, e.g., [31]. this leads us to consider ilg where the background m has the
topology of a torus. the induced action of this theory is (see (2.12))

the at space m is a torus

we assume that

[g] = il[] + nw [ m]
il[] = 
d2y( )2

ds2 = d 2 + dx2

0 <    ,

0 < x  b

.

(6.9)

(6.10)

(6.11)

(6.12)

the solutions to this theory are constant  and on the solutions the induced action
coincides with nw [ m]. thus, the on-shell euclidean action of ilg corresponds to the
free energy of massless gas on a circle of length b at the temperature  1. in the limit
when size b is large one can nd the action on the torus from the leading order expression
(4.23) for the free energy on the interval of size b. we thus obtain

f (b, )  n


6

b
2

.

(6.13)

this free energy corresponds to the cft with the integer central charge c = n. consider
now the btz black hole with the same central charge c 10

cbt z =

3l
2g

= n .

(6.14)

this charge corresponds to the group of dieomorphisms at the asymptotic innity of the
btz black hole. by now replacing n in (6.13) by cbt z and putting b = 2l we come to
the identity between the ilg and btz free energy (6.6)

f bt z(l, ) = f (2l, )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)n =cbt z

.

(6.15)

the corresponding identities can be established for the entropy (6.7) and energy (6.8) of
the black hole. therefore, the static btz black hole is thermodynamically equivalent to

10the conformal virasoro algebra with an integer central charge has a number of interesting features

which were discussed in [32].

18

1 + 1 ilg having cbt z massless elds and given on the circle of the radius l (l is related
to the curvature radius of the corresponding ads3 geometry, see (6.1)).

this result can be also generalized to rotating btz black holes. if the angular velocity

 of the black hole is not zero, the free energy (6.6) is replaced to [31]

f bt z(, l, ) = 

2l2

2g2(1  l22)

.

(6.16)

the corresponding two dimensional system equivalent to this black hole is a rotating
quantum gas. to be more specic, consider a massless gas where half of the quanta are
rotating clock-wise with angular velocity  and the other half are moving in the opposite
direction. the corresponding free-energies of these quanta denoted by f are determined
by the boosted partition functions

ef = tre( h  m )

,

(6.17)

where h is the hamiltonian and m is the angular momentum related to the momentum
p along the circle as

m =

p .

(6.18)

b
2

(b/(2) is the radius of the circle). the energy of a relativistic massless particle equals
the modulus of its momentum. therefore

ef = tre(1 ) h ,

 =

b
2

.

thus, when b is large one can nd f with the help of (4.23)

f(, b, )

the total free-energy of the system is 11

(6.22)

now by taking into account (6.20) and that b = 2l we can generalize the relation (6.15)

f bt z(, l, ) = f (, 2l, )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)n =cbt z

.

(6.23)

once one has the thermodynamic relation (6.23) between the btz black hole and a two-
dimensional rotating gas, the statistical-mechanical explanation of the two-dimensional
entropy can be considered as an explanation of the black hole entropy [6]. this, however,
cannot be taken as a satisfactory explanation of the entropy, because the degrees of
freedom of the two-dimensional theory have nothing to do with the degrees of freedom of
the black hole.

11a similar computation can be found in [33].

7 discussion

recent interesting computations of the entropy of extremal [4],[5] and btz [6] black holes
leave open the essential question about the real degrees of freedom of the black hole. the
diculty is that the computations concern not black holes themselves but dual systems
in at space-times. some help in resolving this diculty may come from studying models
of sakharovs induced gravity [18][20]. in this theory the degrees of freedom responsible
for the black hole entropy are the constituents which induce the einstein gravity in the
low-energy limit.

the liouville induced gravity considered in this paper is a suitable ring range
to study this issue. we have shown that the entropy of induced ads2 black holes is
equivalent to the entanglement entropy of the massless constituents. in two dimensions
the divergence usually encountered in the denition of the entanglement entropy does
not depend on the thermodynamical parameters of the black hole and, hence, is not
observable in physical processes. therefore, going to two-dimensional induced gravity
leads to an essential simplication. in higher-dimensional models the relation between the
entanglement and black hole entropies is more complicated. it always requires subtraction
a non-trivial noether charge related to non-minimal couplings of the constituents [19].
another distinction is that in higher dimensions the main contribution to the entanglement
entropy is determined only by the constituents with the planck mass localized in the
vicinity of the horizon. in ilg the entropy is related to the elds which are localized in
the entire black hole exterior.

the induced liouville gravity has solutions of dierent types which may nd dierent
applications. the important example are the solutions with zero cosmological constant
on a torus. on the level of thermodynamics they are equivalent to btz black holes.
it would be interesting to see whether there is a similar relation of the found solutions,
including ads2 black holes, and thermodynamics of the objects in the three-dimensional
ads space. another interesting problem is to analyze along the lines of section 6 the
theory [12], [13] which appears in the near horizon limit of generic black holes. we leave
these issues for future publication.
