abstract

by quantizing an open string ending on a d-brane in a nontrivial supergravity background, we
argue that there is a new kind of uncertainty relation on a d-brane worldvolume. furthermore,
we x the form of the uncertainty relations and their dependence on the string coupling constant
by requiring them to be consistent with various string theory and m theory dualities. in this way
we nd a web of uncertainties of spacetime for all kinds of brane probes, including fundamental
strings, d-branes of all dimensions as well as m theory membranes and vebranes.

introduction

string theory is a promising candidate of quantum gravity and the theory of spacetime. it is
therefore an interesting question to study the properties of spacetime in string theory. a number
of uncertainty relations have been proposed in relation to string theory. see, for example, [1, 2]
for a review of the subject and for further references. it was rst proposed [3] that a modied
version of the canonical heisenberg uncertainty relation

xp  1 + l2

s p 2,

(1)

governs the high energy behavior of string theory. this relation implies the existence of a
minimal scale x  ls [3]. another uncertainty relation is the one proposed by yoneya [4]

t x  l2
s.

(2)

he further suggested that the spacetime uncertainty relation can be one of the fundamental
principles underlying the nonperturbative string theory, and can also be one of the guiding
principles for constructing a covariant formulation of m theory [4].

in this paper, we propose a new kind of uncertainty relation

x 0x 1    x p  gslp+1

s

(3)

for the worldvolume of a dp-brane. here x i are the d-brane worldvolume coordinates. we also
propose a similar kind of uncertainty relations for the m-branes.

it is well known that in string theory dierent probes could see slightly dierent spacetime
geometries. so it is natural to expect that the uncertainty principle can be dierent for dierent
probes, as it is manifest in our proposed relations (3). note that (3) is involved only with the
longitudinal directions on a d-branes, that is, the d-brane worldvolume. another uncertainty
relation involving both longitudinal and transverse directions for a d-brane was proposed by
yoneya and collaborators [2, 4, 5]. he proposed that if one interprets t and x as the longitudinal
and transverse coordinates of a d-brane, (2) can also be understood as an uncertainty relation
for a d-brane.

in the brane world scenario [6], it is argued that we could be living on a d-brane. it is thus of
great interest to determine the form of uncertainty relations on a d-brane worldvolume, which
will be interpreted as the uncertainty relation for the four dimensional spacetime on which we are
trapped. since it is also known that a d-brane worldvolume becomes noncommutative [7, 8] in
the presence of a nontrivial background bn sn s eld in the direction of the brane, it is natural
to ask what kind of uncertainty relation follows this worldvolume noncommutativity [9, 10]. in
this paper we rst show how to obtain the uncertainty relation for a d1-brane by integrating
out quantum uctuations of the background eld. then we use various dualities in string theory
and m theory to extend the uncertainty relation to other d-branes and strings or membranes.
putting all the old and new dualities together, we nd a web of spacetime uncertainty relations
associated with all the branes in string theory or m theory.

the organization of this paper is as follow.

in sec.2, we rst extend the previous results
[7, 8, 10] about the noncommutativity of d-brane by generalizing the background to the rst

2

nontrivial (yet manageable) order, with a curved background metric g and a nontrivial ns-ns
2-form eld. then we argue in sec.3 that these commutation relations give rise to uncertainty
relations on the d-brane worldvolume. while the precise form of the uncertainty relations cannot
be easily xed this way, one can use the dualities of string theory and m theory to constrain
the form of the uncertainty relations. guided by this idea, we propose in sec.4 worldvolume
uncertainty relations for d-branes, m2-branes, m5-branes, as well as fundamental strings. we
check that they are consistent with various dualities of string theory and m theory. finally we
make a few remarks in sec.5.

2 noncommutativity from open string quantization

it was rst proposed by connes, douglas and schwarz [7], and by douglas and hull [8], that the
matrix model compactied on a torus with the ns-ns b eld background should be described
by a eld theory living on a noncommutative space. this conjecture has been veried in various
ways (see, e.g. [11]). in particular, it was pointed out in [12] that this can be seen by quantizing
an open string ending on a d-brane. based on the intimate relation between compactied matrix
models and d-brane worldvolume theories, hauman and verlinde [13] also suggested that the
low energy eective theory for a d-brane compactied on a torus with b eld background should
also live on a noncommutative space. following [12], the quantization of the open string ending
on a d-brane with a constant f = b  f eld background in at spacetime was carried out in
[10]. an agreement with previous works was obtained but the framework and results of [10] were
more general. in this section we generalize further the previous work to a curved background
and non-constant f eld. the derivation is in parallel with [10].

for an open string with an end-point sticking to a dp-brane with u (1) eld strength f in a

b-eld background, the bosonic part of its action can be written as

sb =

4 z

d2hg x x  + f x x i ,

where

f = b  f

(4)

(5)

is the modied born-infeld eld strength on the d-brane, f = da and ai, i = 0, 1,    , p, is
the u (1) gauge potential living on the dp-brane. we use the convention  = diag(1, 1) and
01 = 1 as in [10]. note that f is invariant under the gauge transformations

and

the equations of motion are

a  a + d, b  b,

b  b + d, a  a + .

g( x  + 

 x  x )  g(x  + 

 x x ) + h x  x  = 0,

(6)

where

g(g +  g  g )

is the riemannian connection for the metric and

h = f + f + f ,

that is, h = df. in fact, since df = 0, h = db. the boundary conditions are

x

gi + x fi = 0 for i = 0, 1,    , p,

x a = xa
0

for a = p + 1,    , 9,

at  = 0, , where xa

0 gives the position of the dp-brane.

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

for convenience we have chosen the spacetime coordinates in such a way that xa

0 are constant
on the dp-brane. we will use the indices (i, j,   ) for directions parallel to the brane (i =
0, 1,    , p) and the indices (a, b,   ) for directions transverse to the brane (a = p + 1,    , 9). we
will choose the coordinates such that gia = 0 on the d-brane for convenience. the momentum
density is

2p = x  g + x

f.

(13)

for a constant background (f =constant) in a at spacetime (g =  ), one can solve the
equations of motion and boundary conditions exactly and carry out the canonical quantization
[10]. the nal result is

where

[x i, x j] = 2i(m 1f)ij,

mij = ij  fi

kfkj,

(14)

(15)

and x i is the spacetime coordinates of the open string at the two end-points  = 0, . the
indices are lowered or raised by the spacetime metric . while this result does not need a
compactication, in case the spacetime is compactied on a torus, the right hand side of (14)
for f = 0 is proportional to the dual b eld on the dual torus. it agrees with the results for
the bfss matrix model [7]. for the case of a non-constant f on a at torus and its relation to
deformation quantization, see [14].

for a generic background, we are unable to nd the most general solution in parallel of (14).
however it is possible to nd a special solution in a certain approximation of weak eld and
slow variation. consider a deviation from the trivial background f = 0, g =  with small f
and g considered as rst order quantities. we will consider g as second order and so from
the einstein equation for the background, f  g are also of the rst order. in summary,
we will consider (x, x, g) as terms of the 0th order, (f, f, g) as terms of the 1st order, and
(nf, ng), n  2 as terms of higher orders. we will only keep terms of the 0th and 1st order
consistently. to solve the equations of motion and boundary conditions, we use the following
ansatz for x

x i = xi( ) + yi( ), x a = xa
0.

(16)

4

it is easy to check that this ansatz for the  dependence is consistent with our approximation.
substituting (16) into the boundary conditions (11), one nds that y is of rst order:

for this ansatz, the equations of motion (8) give the geodesic equation for xi

yi =  xj(fg1(x))j

i.

and the free motion for y

xi + (x)i

jk xj xk = 0,

yi = 0.

eqn.(19) is satised by (17) up to 2nd order terms.

the lowest energy modes on a string are thus approximately given by

x i = xi + (g1fg1(x))ikpk,

2pi = pi  pmpngmj gnk(jfki(x)),

and

where we have introduced

x a = xa

0, pa = 0,

pk = xjgjk(x).

the poisson bracket for the open string is determined by the symplectic two-form 1

dpx .

substituting (20) into (23), we nd

up to second order terms. here pi and xi are dened as

 =

pi = pi 

xi = xi +


2

2

pmpngmjgnk(jfki(x)),

(g1fg1(x))ikpk.

we thus obtain the commutation relations 2

[xi, xj] = 0,

[xi, pj] = 2ii

1 we dont need to do the time average prescription here as in [10]; and if we do it here we will obtain the

same result.

2 normally, special attention has to be paid to the operator ordering when we derive commutation relations
from poisson brackets, so that the jacobi identity is satised if possible. fortunately, in the approximation we
use here, the issue of operator ordering does not arise.

5

or equivalently, in terms of xi and pj, it is

[pi, pj] = 0,

[xi, pj] = 2ii

[xi, xj] = 2i(g1fg1)ij,
j + ipkgkmgin(mfnj + nfmj  jfmn).

(29)

(30)

(31)

all of these hold only up to 2nd order terms. it is easy to verify that the commutation relations
(29)-(31) satisfy the jacobi identity also up to second order terms.

it is now easy to check that for  = 0, ,

[x i, x j] = 2i(g1fg1)ij,

(32)

where the plus (minus) sign corresponds to the end-point  = 0 (). this agrees with the result
for a constant background (14) in the leading order. furthermore, since the right hand side of
(32) is a tensor eld, this equation is covariant under general coordinate transformations up to
second order terms.

in the static gauge x i is the worldvolume coordinate for the d-brane, so the d-brane world-
volume appears to be a noncommutative space. we propose that in the weak eld and slow
variation approximation we considered, (32) gives the commutation relations for the d-brane
spacetime coordinates in a generic background.

under an s-duality transformation, a d-string is turned into a fundamental string. for a
d-string, the noncommutativity is governed by (32) with the ns-ns background f = b  da.
the commutation relation for a fundamental string in the dual theory is thus

[x i, x j] = 2ig

s(g1f g1)ij,

(33)

s = 1/gs is the dual string coupling and f  = b  da is the r-r counterpart of f in
where g
the dual theory. since we assumed that gs is small to derive (32), (33) is valid only for large g
s.
it would be interesting if one can derive this directly from string theory.

3 noncommutative gauge theory and uncertainty relations

the noncommutativity (32) signies the existence of uncertainty relations on the brane. to
give a precise formulation, we rst need to explain what we mean by an uncertainty x. the
suitable framework for discussing uncertainty relation is to employ the language of string eld
theory [15]. let  be the normalized wave function for the d-brane and dene (x i)2 by

(x i)2 = z [dx()](x())(x i()  x i )2(x()),

where

x i = z [dx()](x())x i()(x()).

(34)

(35)

6

in these equations,  = (0,    , p) denote the worldvolume coordinates of the d-brane. the part
[dx()] of the functional measure denotes an integration over all d-brane congurations. ob-
viously these denitions mimic their counterparts in the familiar case of the quantum mechanics
for a point particle.

applying the standard argument for uncertainty principle to (32) and notice that as a back-

ground, f is independent of the d-brane wavefunction , we get

x ix j  2l2

s |f ij|,

(36)

where f ij = (g1fg1)ij and l2
s = . note that these rst quantized quantities depend on
 and the classical backgrounds. the right hand side of (36) vanishes for a trivial classical
background f = 0. however, as explained in [10], even for such a classical background, there
could be nontrivial uncertainty relations arising from integrating out the quantum uctuations.
on expanding the string eld  into the component elds b, the string eld path integral
becomes an innite product of path integrals over these elds and the expectation value hi of
an operator in string eld theory is dened by

hoi =

1

z z [db]es o where z = z [db]es.

(37)

for example, b includes the metric g and the b-eld. it is thus natural to dene the desired
uncertainty for x i as

using schwarz inequality, we nd

x i = qh(x i)2i.

thus

(x i)2(x j )2  |hx ix ji|2.

x ix j  2l2

s h |f ij| i,

and it generally reduces to something of the form

x ix j  f (gs) l2
s,

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

where f (gs) is some function of gs. we will try to determine f in the weak coupling limit. notice
that this form of uncertainty relation follows more or less from dimensional analysis. the point
of the analysis performed above is to give a precise denition of the quantities involved and to
show that the right hand side of (41) is really nonvanishing.

to see how the gs dependence comes in, it is instructive to consider the case of a d-string.

the commutation relation for the worldsheet directions reads

[x 0, x 1] = 2il2

s f,

(42)

where f = f01 and we have replaced gij by the at metric in our approximation. we thus need
to evaluate

(48)

because we have ignored all stringy corrections of higher

while the derivation above is not completely rigorous, we consider the possibility of extending
this result consistently to all other branes and strings via string dualities in the rest of this paper
as a supporting evidence for (48).

in principle, there could also be other sources contributing to the uncertainty other than
the ns-ns 2-form gauge eld. here we considered only the massless mode of sugra. in an
approximation better than (42), quantum uctuations of the metric also contribute. one should
also take into account string loop eects for a generic gs. these can enter in at least two ways:
first, eqn.(32) was derived from a single string in the rst order approximation; in general
higher order terms and the string loop eects can modify the commutation relations for the
d-brane worldvolume coordinates [16]. second, more precisely one should also use the string
loop corrected sugra action instead of the tree level one in the above derivation. including
all these factors, we expect the uncertainty relation to take the generic form 3

3 uncertainty relations for the d-brane worldvolume has also been discussed in the context of liouville string
theory [17]. there an uncertainty relation of a form similar to (49) was found, but with a dierent dependence
(gs instead of gs) on the string coupling.

up to a numerical factor which will be ignored in this paper; and the omitted terms are of higher
order in gs and  due to the above-mentioned higher order corrections. there could also be a
dependence on  in the higher order corrections. obviously one can perform the same derivation
for a dp-brane with p > 1 and nd the same uncertainty relation between any two directions on
the d-brane.

at this point, one may ask a number of questions. for example, is it possible to determine
explicitly the higher order corrections in (49)? how does the above generalize to the case of the
other dp-brane? how does the uncertainty relation look like on a dp-brane? what we will do
is to nd new uncertainty relations by requiring the uncertainty relations to be consistent with
the known dualities of string theory. this consistency requirement will be our guiding principle.

4 worldvolume uncertainty relations

in this section, we will propose a form of the uncertainty relations for dp-branes which is
consistent with dualities of string theory. to strengthen the starting ground for our argument
which leads to the general result, we rst consider the cases of d1 and d0-branes in more detail.

4.1 d1-branes

from sec.3, we nd that the uncertainty relation for a d-string in the small gs limit in at
spacetime takes the form

x 0x 1  gsl2
s .

(50)

eqn.(50) gives a minimal area for the d1-brane worldsheet.

an independent support for this result can be obtained by s-duality. under s-duality, a
d1-brane is interchanged with a fundamental string, and the string tension interchanged with
the d1-brane tension. thus the uncertainty relation for a fundamental string should be

x 0x 1  l2
s .

(51)

this is in fact what people have suggested based on properties of string scattering amplitudes;
worldsheet conformal invariance and other various arguments [18]. this can also be heuristically
argued as follows (rst two references of [18]). according to the canonical uncertainty relation
in quantum mechanics

et  1,

(52)

(where t should be identied with x 0,) if t is small, e will be large. since e  1/ times
string length, it is associated with a large uncertainty x 1 in the string length [19]. (for this
argument to be more rigorous, we need a virial theorem stating that a certain portion of the
energy must be attributed to the potential energy due to string tension.)

9

4.2 d0-branes

the usual uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics (52) implies that

t 

1
e



1
e

,

(53)

where we assumed that e  e. (this would be the case if e is positive denite.) in the rest
frame of the d0-brane, e = 1/(gsls) is the mass of a d0-brane, so we nd

t  gsls,

(54)

where t is the proper time for the d0-brane worldline.

we can also interpret (54) as follows. if (54) is not satised, the energy of a d0-brane can be
larger than its rest mass and can thus lead to pair productions of d0 and anti-d0-branes. one
can then imagine a quantum path in which the created anti-d0-brane annihilates the original
d0-brane so that the created d0-brane survives as the nal d0-brane. in such cases the proper
time is ill-dened during the process of creation and annihilation.

in [19] it was explained that the short distance behavior of d-branes is described by the low
energy physics of open strings ending on the d-branes. for d0-branes two dierent characteristic
scales were found. the rst scale is the planck scale for the 11 dimensional sugra, which is
g1/3
ls in accordance with the duality between m theory and type ii a theory. assuming gs < 1,
s
the planck scale is smaller than the string scale ls which characterizes the uncertainty relation
for fundamental strings. the planck scale was found as the characteristic scale of the 0 + 1
dimensional sym theory, which describes the low energy theory of d0-branes. although the
planck scale is believed to be the minimal scale in 11d sugra, it is not the scale of uncertainty
relations for d0-branes since a smaller characteristic scale gsls was found in [19]. it is called
the ne structure scale, which can be seen only after taking into account the correction of
the sym action by the dbi action. note that no smaller scale was found in the analysis of
[19]. although the ne structure scale was obtained as the characteristic scale in the transverse
(spatial) directions, based on our results above we propose in this paper that the ne structure
scale also sets the minimal length on a d0-brane worldline as in (54).

another support for the claim that (54) gives the correct uncertainty relation for d0-branes
is obtained via t-duality. if the d1-brane has the uncertainty relation t x  gsl2
s, then for
a d1-brane wrapped on a compactied circle with radius r, 4 x can not be larger than r,
which implies that t  gsl2
s/r. by t-duality this is interpreted as a dual d0-brane with the
uncertainty t  g
s = gsls/r is the string coupling constant in the dual theory.
this is exactly what we claimed in (54).

sls, where g

incidentally we note that in terms of m theory, gsls is the radius of the compactication
through which the m theory is dual to type ii a theory. by compactifying m theory on a circle
smaller than the planck scale, the smaller scale gsls is introduced into the compactied m

4 since we assume that the string couplings are smaller than 1, the compactication radius needs to satisfy
s > r > gsls.

theory. this would not be possible if there were an uncertainty relation like x  lp in the
uncompactied m theory. on the other hand, this is consistent with the worldvolume uncertainty
relations we nd for membranes and 5-branes as in (62), (63).

4.3 dp-branes via t-duality

in the above we have seen that t-duality can be used to derive uncertainty relation of d0-branes
from that of d1-branes. here we will generalize the arguments to all dp-branes.

for simplicity we rst consider the case of a at background. we know that a d-string can
be obtained from a d2-brane under t-duality. by wrapping a leg of the d2-brane on the circle,
one introduces on the d2-brane worldvolume an uncertainty of the order

x 2  r,

(55)

since the center of the d-brane can be anywhere on the circle. it is thus natural to guess that
the uncertainty relation on a d2-brane will involve a product of uncertainties of the form

x 0x 1x 2  gsl3
s ,

(56)

which is the product of the uncertainty relation (50) for a d1-brane and (55) in terms of the
dual gs and ls.

on the other hand, one can also repeat the derivation of d1-brane uncertainty relation in
sec.3 for d2-branes. since x ix j  gsl2
s +    for all i 6= j, i, j = 0, 1, 2, one can derive
x 0x 1x 2  g3/2
l3
s +   . this is a weaker condition than (56). at this moment we do
not know how to derive (56) directly from open strings ending on d2-branes as in the case of
d1-branes. we leave this interesting question for future study.

s

for a dp-brane in general, we propose that

x 0x 1    x p  gsls

p+1

(57)

in at spacetime. for a dp-brane in curved spacetime, the natural generalization of the uncer-
tainty relation is just

v(p+1)  gslp+1

s

,

(58)

where v(p+1) is the uncertainty of the dp-brane worldvolume, which is the spacetime volume
corresponding to x i.

one can check that (57) respects the t-duality of string theory. to see this, suppose that we
start with a dp-brane in a string theory compactied on a circle of radius r with string coupling
gs. we take one of the dimensions of the dp-brane, says x p, to be wrapped on the circle. since
x p  r, we get for the d(p  1)-brane,

x 0x 1    x p1  g

sls

p,

(59)

where g

s = gsls/r is the dual string coupling. thus (57) is consistent with t-duality.

11

it is interesting to note that (57) can be derived from (52) and

e = t vp,

(60)

s

where t = 1/ gslp+1
is the tension of the dp-brane. consider an experiment conducted on the
dp-brane which is supposed to measure some point-like process. because of the nonvanishing
spacetime uncertainty relation, the region of the process would appear to have a spatial volume
uncertainty of order vp. the associated uncertainty in energy would have a typical order of
(60) and would be consistent with the standard t  e type uncertainty relation (52). however,
to really derive (57) from (52), one should in principle also include other possible sources of
uncertainties (e.g. contributions from the oscillation modes) in (60). the fact that one may
derive (57) by simply using (60) suggests that there might be some sort of stringy virial theorem.

4.4 dyonic branes via s-duality

s-duality is expected to be an exact symmetry of type ii b string theory. under an s-duality
transformation, a dp-brane gets transformed into an (m, n)-p-brane for p = 1, 5. for the purpose
of explicit illustrations, we will spell out the (m, n)-string case in details. (m, n)-5-branes can
be treated similarly.

starting with the uncertainty relation for a d-string (50), we can derive the uncertainty

relation for a (m, n)-string by the sl(2, z) transformation of s-duality. it is

x 0x 1  l2
s

1

q(m  n)2 + n2

g2
s

,

(61)

where  is the axion vacuum expectation value. notice that the right hand side is just the
inverse of the tension of the (m, n)-string. in particular, we get (51) as a special case.

4.5 m-branes via m/ii b duality

just as the d-brane is the end-point of an open string, one can also learn about the physics of
the m5-brane by considering it as the boundary of an m2-brane (see for example [20] for other
applications in this direction). it was shown in [10] that the m5-brane worldvolume can also
become noncommutative in the presence of fijk, which is a combination of the three-form gauge
eld and a worldvolume eld strength.

applying similar considerations as in the string case above, we propose the following uncer-

tainty relation for the m2-brane and m5-brane,

x 0x 1x 2  l3
p

for m2-brane,

x 0x 1    x 5  l6
p

for m5-brane,

(62)

(63)

where lp is the 11-dimensional planck length. an uncertainty relation of the same form as
(62) was proposed in [2] as a result of (51) due to the m/ii a duality, but with a dierent
interpretation, which is analogous to the one they had for (71).

12

we now show that (61) is related to the membrane uncertainty (62) by using the m/ii b duality.
it is known [21, 22] that ii b string theory can be obtained from compactifying m theory on a
shrinking 2-torus with radii r1, r11. a ii b (m, n)-string is identied with a membrane wrapped
over the (m, n)-cycle on the torus with length

l(m,n) = r11q(m  n1)2 + n2 2
2 .

(64)

here  = 1 + i2 is the modular parameter of the torus and it is identied [21, 22] with the
ii b string theory parameters as

1 = ,

2 = 1/gs.

now starting from (62) and using

x 2  l(m,n)

(65)

(66)

for the uncertainty for the membrane direction which is wrapped on a cycle, we obtain immedi-
ately (61). here we used l2

s = l3

p/r11.

in fact, since our uncertainty relations can be obtained mathematically from (52) and (60),
the matching of the brane spectra for dual theories implies that the uncertainty relations must
be consistent with all dualities. for instance, it is automatically true that the m/ii a duality
also relates (62) and (63) to (51) and (57) for p = 2, 4. incidentally, the m/ii a duality also gives
rise to the uncertainty relation

x 0    x 5  g2

s l6
s

(67)

for the ns5-brane.

5 discussions

in this paper, we discussed the uncertainty relations for the d-brane worldvolume. we intro-
duced the notion of a worldvolume uncertainty and explained how it is dened within the context
of string eld theory. we proposed worldvolume uncertainty relations that are consistent with
the various dualities in string theory. we have also generalized the commutation relation for
the noncommutative gauge theory to a nontrivial background of f in the lowest order approx-
imation. it would be interesting to generalize this result to the full generality of an arbitrary
background. this could be relevant to the interesting proposal in [23].

in the following we remark on several related subjects.

5.1 comments on some other uncertainty relations

uncertainty relation of wigner

in the classical study of wigner [24], the eects of quantum mechanics on the measurability

of the spatial distance was estimated to be given by

d  qt /mc.

13

(68)

here t is the time scale for the process involved and mc is the mass of the clock. this analysis
has recently been strengthened in [25], which utilizes the existence of a schwarzschild horizon
rs for any massive object and thus it is necessary that

combining with (68), one obtains

d  rs  gmc.

(d)3  gt.

(69)

(70)

notice that in this analysis, the precision of the measurement of time is not limited. the
uncertainty relation we proposed is consistent with these results. for example, in the brane
world scenario, when t = 0, our uncertainty relation for a d3-brane says that d = , which
is stronger than (68) or (70).

the argument leading to (70) utilizes the most popular reason for the belief in the existence
of spacetime uncertainty relations. that is, due to quantum mechanics a large energy is needed
to probe a small length scale, and when the energy is too large a black hole is formed, which
forbids the measurement of distances behind the horizon. however, in our derivation of the
uncertainty relations (57), we did not mention anything about event horizon at all. it remains
to be seen how the consideration of black holes can lead to the determination of uncertainty
relations in string theory, and whether it will lead to new uncertainty relations.

uncertainty relation of yoneya

notice that ours uncertainty relations (57) are not of the same type as those proposed in
[2, 4, 5, 26]. these authors proposed uncertainty relations that involve the transverse coordinates
while ours are solely for the brane world. for example, in [2, 4, 5], it was proposed that

t x  l2
s

(71)

for a dp-brane. here t is understood as the uncertainty in the longitudinal directions on the
brane (to be more precise, t = ||, where  is the worldvolume coordinates in the static gauge)
and x represents the uncertainty in directions transverse to the brane. as it was pointed out in
[19], the short distance regime of d-branes are probed by open strings. the exchange of a closed
string state between two d-branes, for example, can be viewed as the creation and annihilation
of a pair of open strings (an open string loop diagram) due to the modular invariance of string
theory. therefore, the scattering of d-branes is limited by the uncertainty of open strings, and
(71) is a direct result of (51).

our uncertainty relation (57), on the other hand, is concerned with the uncertainty among
longitudinal directions on the brane, and it has a form dierent from (71). in particular ours
have a form that depends on the dimensionality of the brane and have additional dependence
on gs.

5.2 uv-ir relations, holography and uncertainty relations

in [5, 2], a generalized conformal symmetry was found for the dp-brane super yang-mills ac-
tion. it is easy to check that the (p + 1)-dimensional ym action with coupling gym, which is

14

schematically

s =

1
g2

ym

z dp+1((x)2 + x 4),

is invariant under the following scaling transformation

x a  x a,

i  1i,

g2
ym  3pg2

ym.

(72)

(73)

(74)

here x a(a = p + 1,    , 9) are the transverse scalars, i(i = 0, 1,    p) are the worldvolume
coordinates in the static gauge. the coupling g2

ym is related to the string coupling by

g2
ym = gslp3

s

.

(75)

the uncertainty relation (71) is invariant under this scaling (73) together with gs  3pgs and
ls being invariant.

notice that (73) is reminiscent of the uv-ir distance relation [27, 28] in the context of
ads/cft holography [29, 30, 31]. maybe this scaling relation is a generic property for general
holographic dualities [32, 33]. it was discussed in [2, 34] that the uncertainty relation (71) is
consistent with the uv-ir relation and it was suggested that the uncertainty principle is the
underlying principle that implies the uv-ir relation, which in turn guarantees the holographic
bound [33] to be satised [27].

since our uncertainty relations are only involved with the worldvolume uncertainties, the
scaling (73)-(74) does not give any nontrivial implications on our relations. on the other hand,
since our uncertainty relation implies the existence of a minimal area, it may also be relevant
to the holographic principle and to the verication of the holographic bound.
it would be
interesting if one can see this explicitly. another interesting issue is that based on the uv-
ir relation and holographic principle, it is natural to ask what kind of spacetime property
(presumably a spacetime uncertainty relation) will be implied by the worldvolume uncertainty
relations. we leave these issues for future studies.

5.3 characteristic scale

the scaling transformation (73)-(74) can also be used to nd the characteristic scale of ym

, then we scale gs  1 and x  g

s x. this means that the higgs

1

p3

p3
theory. let  = g
s

1

1

p3

vacuum expectation value g

s x is independent of gs, and thus the ym characteristic scale is

ls. for p = 0 this gives the planck scale g1/3

1
p3
g
ls. for p = 3 it is the string scale ls. for
s
p > 3 this scale is much larger than the string scale, but for these cases ym theory is not
renormalizable and it means that we cannot trust it.

s

as it was mentioned in sec.4.2, a characteristic scale does not have to be the minimal scale.
for the case of d0-branes, it is the characteristic scale of the dbi action that turns out to be
the minimal scale. it is thus of interest to work out also the characteristic scale for the dbi

15

theory for a dp-brane. the dbi action is

s =

1

gslp+1

s

z dp+1qdet (g + f),

which is invariant under the scaling

x  x,

gs  p+1gs,

(76)

(77)

1
p+1
and an arbitrary scaling of . letting  = g
s

1

, we nd gs  1 and x  g

s x. this means

1
p+1

p+1
ls is the characteristic scale of the dbi action for the transverse directions. it happens
that g
s
that this characteristic scale is also the one determining the minimal volume in our uncertainty
relations (58). it is possible that this is also the minimal length scale for the transverse directions
of a dp-brane much like the case of d0-branes discussed in [19].

even if both the transverse and longitudinal directions of a d0-brane are bounded by this
scale gsls, (71) is still a stronger condition than just the product of the two minimal lengths.
in sec.4.3 we also mentioned that (57) is a stronger condition than a product of (50) for each
pair of longitudinal directions.
it seems that in string theory we need a complicated web of
uncertainty relations, which cannot be deduced from a single master relation, to fully state the
uncertainty property of spacetime.
