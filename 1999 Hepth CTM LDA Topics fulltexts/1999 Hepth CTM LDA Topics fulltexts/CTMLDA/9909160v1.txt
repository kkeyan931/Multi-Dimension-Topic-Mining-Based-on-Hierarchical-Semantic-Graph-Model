we discuss the asymptotic form of the static axially symmetric, globally regular and black hole

solutions, obtained recently in einstein-yang-mills and einstein-yang-mills-dilaton theory.

recently, we have constructed static axially symmetric regular and black hole solutions in su(2) einstein-yang-
mills (eym) and einstein-yang-mills-dilaton (eymd) theory [16]. representing generalizations of the spherically
symmetric regular and black hole solutions [79,6], these solutions are characterized by two integers, their winding
number n and the node number k of their gauge eld functions. the spherically symmetric solutions have winding
number n = 1.

these non-abelian eym and eymd solutions are asymptotically at. they have non-trivial magnetic gauge eld
congurations, but carry no global charge. to every globally regular solution there exists a corresponding family of
black hole solutions with regular event horizon xh > 0. these non-abelian black hole solutions demonstrate that
neither the no-hair theorem nor israels theorem hold in eym and eymd theory.

here we give a detailed account of the asymptotic form of these static axially symmetric solutions. in particular we
nd, that the expansion of the gauge eld functions in powers of 1/x must be supplemented with non-analytic terms
for n = 2 and 4.

let us briey recall the su(2) einstein-yang-mills-dilaton action

we x the gauge by choosing [14]

for convenience we introduce dimensionless quantities [14]

to obtain globally regular solutions or black hole solutions with a regular horizon with the proper symmetries,
we must impose appropriate boundary conditions [14]. for asymptotically at, magnetically neutral solutions the
boundary conditions at innity are

f|x= = m|x= = l|x= = 1 ,

h2|x= = h4|x= = 1 , h1|x= = h3|x= = 0 ,

of the functions at innity in powers of 1/x, not considering possible non-analytic terms. this expansion reads [3]

we now consider the asymptotic form of the functions at innity. in appendix c of [3] we presented the expansion

the above expansion in powers of 1/x is, however, not necessarily complete, since non-analytic terms may be
present. inspection of the numerical solutions [14] reveals, that ln x terms must be included in the expansion of the
gauge eld functions for n = 2 and 4, to obtain the proper asymptotic form of the solutions. in particular, for an
even number of nodes and for winding number n = 2 we obtain

and the asymptotic solutions for an odd number of nodes are obtained from the asymptotic solutions for an even
number of nodes by multiplying the functions h1, h2 and h4 by minus one. note the explicit occurrence of  in the
expansions for n = 2 and 4. for all n, the leading terms of the dilaton function are

and for the metric functions the equations (15)-(17) hold [12].

we now discuss the properties of these asymptotic solutions, assuming x >> 1. first of all we note that along
the z- and -axis all functions fulll the proper boundary conditions [14]. furthermore, under the transformation
     the gauge eld functions h1 and f3 are odd while h2 and f4 are even, consequently h3 is odd while h4
is even.
concerning regularity of the asymptotic solutions along the symmetry axis, we found, using the analysis of ref. [5],
(z) exist, which lead to locally regular gauge potentials along the z-axis. thus, up

that local gauge transformations (n)
to the order of the expansion the asymptotic solutions are regular.

for n = 2 we checked that the contributions from the next orders (ln x/x3 and 1/x3) do not change the regularity
and symmetry properties of the asymptotic solutions. we conjecture that this is also true for the corresponding higher
order terms of the n = 3 and n = 4 asymptotic solutions.

since ln x/x2 and ln x/x4 can not be expanded as a power series in 1/x a naive construction of the asymptotic

solutions as power series in 1/x does not lead to the proper solutions for n = 2 and n = 4, respectively.

finally we note, that comparison of the asymptotic solution eqs. (18)-(21) with the numerical solutions, e. g. for

n = 2 and k = 1, yields excellent agreement.
