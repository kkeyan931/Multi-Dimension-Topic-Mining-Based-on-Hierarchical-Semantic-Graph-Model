we show that in the functional integral formalism the (nite) coecient
of the induced, lorentz- and cpt-violating chern-simons term, arising from
the lorentz- and cpt-violating fermion sector, is undetermined.

in recent work [1], the following question has been posed: is a lorentz- and cpt-violating
chern-simons term induced by the lorentz- and cpt-violating term b/5 (b a constant
4-vector) in the conventional lagrangian of qed. in the paper by jackiw and kostelecky [2],
this problem has been discussed. their results depend on whether one uses a nonperturbative
formalism or a perturbative formalism. in a nonperturbative formalism, radiative corrections
arising from the axial vector term in the fermion sector induce a denite and nonzero chern-
simons term, while when a perturbative formalism is used, radiative corrections are nite
but undetermined.

the purpose of this note is to view this undeterminicity1 of the nite radiative corrections

in the functional integral formalism.

let us consider the following functional integral

z(a) = z d d exp[ii(a)] ,

(1)

where

i(a) = z d4x[i d/  m  

b/5] .

the gauge eld a in the covariant derivative d/ is external. by changing the eld variables

(x)  exp[i(x)5](x) ,
(x) 
(x) exp[i(x)5] ,

we see that the integration measure of (1) changes by

d d  d d exp(cid:20)iz (x)

82

f (x)f(x)(cid:21) ,

where this form for the anomaly is obtained when d/ is dened in a gauge-invariant
manner. the action changes into

i(a)  z d4xhi d/  j 

5  m e2i(x)5  

b/5i ,

(2)

where the second term (j 
5 ) in the integrand of (2) comes from transformation of the
gauge invariant kinetic term, hence the axial vector current j 
is gauge invariant, and does
5
not necessarily equal to 5, which need not be gauge invariant. however, we must

insist that r d4x 5 is gauge invariant, i.e., the density need not be gauge invariant but

its space-time integral  the action  is gauge invariant. since the chern-simons term
1
2fa = f a behaves precisely in this same way under gauge transformation, we
may use it to represent gauge non-invariant portion of 5. thus we write

where c is an unknown constant. by choosing (x) = xb, j 

5 cancels and we arrive at

5 = j 

5  c f a ,

now let us calculate the vacuum polarization for the theory governed by the action in

the functional integral. the propagator is given as

g(x, y) =

i

i/  me2i5xb (x  y),

which to rst order in b becomes

i

(x  y)

i/  m  2im5xb
 s(x  y)  iz s(x  z)2im5zbs(z  y)d4z
 s(x  y) + g(x, y),

where s(x  y) is the free propagator
splits the vacuum poraization tensor into three parts:

i/m(x  y). this decomposition of the propagator

bb .

the rst term

last term

b , which is linear in b. it is expressed as

is the usual lowest-order vacuum polarization tensor of qed, and the
is at least quadratic in b. our main concern here is to calculate the middle


b (x, y) = tr [s(x  y)g(y, x)] + tr [g(x, y)s(y  x)]

 
the fourier transform of 

b1 (x, y) + 

b2 (x, y) .

b1 (x, y) is readily obtained as:



b1 (p, q) = z d4x d4y eipxeiqy 

b1 (x, y)

= z d4x d4y d4z eipxeiqy tr [s(x  y)(i)s(y  z)2im5zbs(z  x)]

after carrying out x, y, z, r, and k integrations, we are left with a simple momentum

note that in spite of the explicit x-dependence in the action, the vacuum polarization is
translation invariant (proportional to (p  q) in momentum space).

if we observe that 
serving fourier transform of 

b2 (x, y) = 

b2 (x, y) is given by

b1 (y, x), then we readily obtain that the momentum con-

the calculation of the integral determining 



b2 (p) = 

b1 (p) .
b1 (p) can be found in ref. [2]:

b1 (p) = ip

,

where   2 sin1(p2/2m) and p2 < 4m2. therefore we obtain the induced, parity violat-

ing, non-local action, which agrees with [2],

f (p)(cid:20) 

sin   1 + 42c(cid:21)a(p) .

since (/ sin )p2=0 = 1, we get the chern-simons term with an undetermined strength c.
this completes our argument.

we have shown in the functional integration formalism that the (nite) coecient of
the induced, lorentz- and cpt-violating chern-simons term arising from the lorentz- and
cpt-violating fermion sector is undetermined. our result is basically a consequence of
the weaker condition for gauge invariance: since 5 does not couple to any other
eld, physical gauge invariance is maintained provided 5 is gauge invariant at zero
4-momentum [2].
