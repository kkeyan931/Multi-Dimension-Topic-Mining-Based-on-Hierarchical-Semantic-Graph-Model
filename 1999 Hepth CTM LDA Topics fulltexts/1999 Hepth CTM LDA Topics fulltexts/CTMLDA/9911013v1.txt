abstract

the eective p-brane action approach is generalized for arbitrary scalar eld
and applied for the liouville theory near a particle-like solution. it was estab-
lished that this theory has the remarkable features discriminating it from the
theories studied earlier. removing zero modes we obtain the eective action
describing the solution as a point particle with curvature, quantize it as the
theory with higher derivatives and calculate the quantum corrections to mass.

i. introduction

appeared more than a century ago [1] the liouville model have a wide application both
in conventional physics [2] and in such new-fashioned regions of modern physics as chern-
simons theory and gauge gravity [3], string and conformal eld theory [4], wess-zumino-
witten model [5], superstring and m-theory [6], seiberg-witten approach [7], to mention
just few examples and references.

the aim of this paper is to study the liouville theory in the neighborhood of the particle-
like solution within the frameworks of the brane approach, which consists in the constructing
of the eective action where the non-minimal terms (rst of all, depending on the world-
volume curvature) are induced by the eld uctuations. then the required action evidently
arises after nonlinear reparametrization of an initial theory when excluding zero eld oscil-
lations.

the paper is arranged as follows. in sec. ii we study the liouville particle-like soliton
on the classical level. in sec. iii we generalize and enhance the approach developed by ka-
pustnikov and pashnev [8], for arbitrary scalar elds and apply it for the model in question.
sec. iv is devoted to quantization of the obtained zero-brane action as a constrained the-
ory with higher derivatives. in result we obtain the schroedinger wave equation eectively
describing wave function and mass spectrum of a point particle with curvature, calculate
the null and rst excited levels to derive the quantum corrections to the mass of the studied
soliton. conclusions are made in sec. v.

ii. particle-like solutions

we start with the action

s[] =

1

2z d2xh(m)2 + me2 + i ,

(2.1)

where m,  and  are constants. the equation of motion in the class of solitary waves is

 + m e2 = 0,

 = (x  vt),  = 1/1  v2. its general solution has the form
c  cosh2(cid:16)mc(cid:17)
 ,
2c cosh(cid:16)mc(cid:17)

arcsinh

sol() =

1


(2.2)

(2.3)

where the c 6= 0 is another integration constant, all the constants are assumed to be such
that the potential is real everywhere on the axis. the corresponding energy density,

sol(x, t) =

m

2 hc  /m  2c sech2(cid:16)mc(cid:17)i ,

turns to be localized if we suppose

c = /m.

2

(2.4)

then the total energy is nite despite the potential diverges at the innity, and can be
rewritten in the explicit relativistic point-particle form

eclass =

z

(x, t) dx = ,  =

2


,

(2.5)

hence it is interesting to note that the additive constant  (in spite of it does not appear
in the equation of motion) aects on the most important properties of the particle-like
solitons (2.3) by virtue of the localization requirement (2.4). this is the key dierence of
the liouville theory from those studied earlier, viz., 4 [8], 3 [9] and sine-gordon. among
the other features one can mention the initial    symmetry breaking (like 3-model)
and that the theory does not admit the trivial vacuum state  = 0.

iii. effective action

in this section we take into account the eld uctuations in the neighborhood of the
solution (2.3), (2.4) and construct the nonlinear eective zero-brane (non-minimal point
particle) action. however, rstly, perfecting and generalizing the method [8], we develop
some general approach to such theories.

a. general formalism

let us consider the action describing arbitrary one-scalar eld

s[] =z l() d2x,

l() =

1
2

(n)(n)  u().

the corresponding equation of motion is

nn + u1() = 0,

where we dened

u1() =

u()



, u2() =

2 u()

2

.

suppose, we have a solution in the class of solitary waves

having the localized energy density

sol() = sol ((x  vt)) ,

() =

l()
(0)

0  l(),

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

and nite mass integral

 =

+z

(sol) d = 

l(sol) d < ,

+z

coinciding with the total energy up to the lorentz factor .

let us change to the set of the collective coordinates {0 = s, 1 = } such that

xn = xn(s) + en

(1)(s), (x, t) = e(),

where xn(s) turn to be the coordinates of a (1+1)-dimensional point particle, en
(1)(s) is the
unit spacelike vector orthogonal to the world line. hence, the action (3.1) can be rewritten
in new coordinates as

1

s[e] =z l(e)  d2,
2" (se)2
2  (e)2#  u(e),
l(e) =
l(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
 = det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
=  x2(1  k),

xn

k =

ln xl xn
( x2)3

,

where

and k is the curvature of a particle world line

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

where ln is the unit antisymmetric tensor. this new action contains the redundant degree of
freedom which eventually leads to appearance of the so-called zero modes. to eliminate
it we must constrain the model by means of the condition of vanishing of the functional
derivative with respect to eld uctuations about a chosen static solution, and in result we
will obtain the required eective action.

are given by the expression

so, the uctuations of the eld e() in the neighborhood of the static solution sol()

e() = sol() + ().

substituting them into eq. (3.8) and considering the static equation of motion (3.3) for
sol() we have

s[] =z d2 ("l(sol) +
u2(sol)2!#  k x2

2  (s )2
2 (cid:16)(cid:17)2
sol + o(3)) + [-surface terms],

(3.11)

l(sol) =

 2
sol  u(sol),

where prime means the derivative with respect to . extremalizing this action with respect
to  one can obtain the system of equations in partial derivatives for eld uctuations:

(cid:16)s1s  (cid:17)  + u2(sol) + 

solk x2 = o(2),

(3.12)

which has to be the constraint removing a redundant degree of freedom.
supposing
(s, ) = k(s)f (), in the linear approximations k  1 (which naturally guarantees
also the smoothness of a world line at   0) and o(2) = 0 we obtain a system of the
ordinary derivative equations

where c is the constant of separation. searching for a solution of the last equation in the
form

we obtain the homogeneous equation

f = g +

1
c



sol,

 g  + 

sol  c! g = 0.



sol

(3.15)

(3.16)

strictly speaking, the explicit form of g() is not signicant for us, because we always can
suppose integration constants to be zero thus restricting ourselves by the special solution.
nevertheless, the homogeneous equation should be considered as the eigenvalue problem for
c (see below).

substituting the found function  = kf back in the action (3.11), we can rewrite it in

the explicit p-brane form

se = s

(class)

(uct)

= z ds x2(cid:16) + k2(cid:17) ,

describing a point particle with curvature, where  was dened in (3.6), and

further, from the static equation (3.3) we obtain the expression

(

sol  u1(sol)) 

sol = 0,

which can be rewritten as

2

sol = 2u(sol()).

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

considering eqs. (3.5), (3.6), (3.15), (3.19) and (3.20), the expression for  can be written
in the simple form

 =


2c

+

1
2c2

+z

u (sol()) d,

(3.21)

sol()| 
where the second term can be integrated as a full derivative, and vanishes when |
o(1) at innity. even it does not happen, we always can include this term into the surface
terms of the action (3.11). thus, we obtain the nal form of the eective p-brane action of
the theory

it is straightforward to derive the corresponding equation of motion in the frenet basis

se = z ds x2(cid:18)1 +

(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

(3.26)

hence one can see that eq. (3.13) was nothing but this equation in the linear approximation
k  1, as was expected.
thus, the only problem which yet demands on the resolving is the determination of
eigenvalue c.
(3.16) provided some
chosen boundary conditions. if one supposes, for instance, the niteness of g at innity then
the c spectrum turns to be discrete. moreover, it often happens that c has only one or two
admissible values [8,9]. in any case we are needed in the exact value of c hence for each
concrete case eq. (3.16) should be resolved as exactly as possible.

it turns to be the stourm-liouville problem for eq.

b. application for liouville model

we will suppose the nal p-brane action (3.22) and will determine its parameters. we
already have  derived in (2.5), and the eigenvalue c remains to be the only unknown
parameter. as a boundary condition for the stourm-liouville problem (3.16), we require

whereas (3.16) reads

g(+)  g() = o(1),

g  +c +

 g = 0.

2

cosh2(cid:16)(cid:17)
c = 2,

according to the proven theorem (see appendix a), the only admissible non-zero c is

hence the eective zero-brane action of the liouville model near particle-like solution (2.3),
(2.4) with uctuational corrections is

se = z ds x2 1 

k2

22! .

(3.27)

in the next section we will quantize it to obtain the quantum corrections to the mass of the
solution.

iv. quantization

in the previous section we obtained a classical eective action for the model in question.
thus, to quantize it we must consecutively construct the hamiltonian structure of dynamics
of the point particle with curvature [10]. from the p-brane action (3.22) and denition of
the world-line curvature one can see that we have the theory with higher derivatives [11].
hence, below we will treat the coordinates and momenta as the canonically independent
coordinates of phase space. besides, the hessian matrix constructed from the derivatives
with respect to accelerations,

mab = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2le

 xa xb(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

,

appears to be singular that says about the presence of the constraints on phase variables of
the theory.

as was mentioned, the phase space consists of the two pairs of canonical variables:

xm, pm =

qm = xm, m =

le
qm  m,
le
 qm ,

hence we have

pn = en

n = 
c

(0)(cid:20)1 
en
(1)q2

k,

1

2c(cid:21) +


c

en
(1)q2

k,

where the components of the frenet basis are

em
(0) =

xm
 x2

, em

(1) = 

1
 x2

em
(0)
k

.

there exist the two primary constraints of rst kind

1 = mqm  0,
2 = pmqm +qq2" +

q22#  0,

c
2

besides we should add the proper time gauge condition,

g =qq2  1  0,

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

to remove the non-physical gauge degree of freedom. then, when introducing the new
variables,

 =qq2, v = arctanh(cid:16)p(1)/p(0)(cid:17) ,

7

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

the constraints can be rewritten in the form

1 = ,

2 = "qp2 cosh v +  

c

2(cid:16)2

(cid:17)# ,
v  22

g =   1,

hence nally we obtain the constraint

2 = qp2 cosh v +  
c
2
which in the quantum theory (v = i/v) yields
b2|i = 0.

2
v  0,

as was shown in ref. [8], the constraint 2 on the quantum level admits several coordinate
representations that, generally speaking, lead to dierent nonequivalent theories, therefore,

the choice between the dierent forms of b2 should be based on the physical relevance. then

the physically admissible equation determining quantum dynamics of the quantum kink and
bell particles has the form:

d2
d 2 +

ch = 

where

1

2(cid:19) cosh ,

b2
4

[ch  ]() = 0,
sinh2  b(cid:18)s +
 = v/2, qp2 = m,
b = 8s m

,

c

 =

82

c  1  m
 ! ,

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

and s = 0 in our case.

as was established in the works [12,13], su(2) has to be the dynamical symmetry group

for this hamiltonian which can be rewritten in the form of the spin hamiltonian

where the spin operators,

z  bsx,

ch = s2

satisfy with the commutation relations

[si, sj] = iijksk,

besides

x + s2
s2

y + s2

z  s(s + 1).

in this connection it should be noted that though the reformulation of some interaction
concerning the coordinate degrees of freedom in terms of spin variables is widely used (e.g.,
in the theories with the heisenberg hamiltonian, see ref. [14]), it has to be just the physical
approximation as a rule, whereas in our case the spin-coordinate correspondence is exact.
further, at s  0 there exists an irreducible (2s + 1)-dimensional subspace of the repre-
sentation space of the su(2) lie algebra, which is invariant with respect to these operators.
determining eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the spin hamiltonian in the matrix representa-
tion which is realized in this subspace, one can prove that the solution of eq. (4.11) is the
function

() = exp(cid:18)

b
2

cosh (cid:19) sx=s

c

q(s  )! (s + )!

exp (),

(4.16)

where the coecients c are the solutions of the system of linear equations

(cid:18) + 2(cid:19)c +

b

2(cid:20)q(s  )(s +  + 1) c+1 +q(s + )(s   + 1) c1(cid:21) = 0,
cs+1 = cs1 = 0,  = s,  s + 1, ..., s.

however, it should be noted that these expressions give only the nite number of exact
solutions which is equal to the dimensionality of the invariant subspace (this is the so-called
qes, quasi-exactly solvable, system). therefore, for the spin s = 0 we can nd only the
ground state wave function and eigenvalue:

0() = c1 exp(cid:18)

b
2

cosh (cid:19), 0 = 0.

(4.17)

hence, we obtain that the ground-state mass of the quantum particle with curvature coin-
cides with the classical one,

m0 = ,

(4.18)

as was expected (strictly speaking, it coincides up to the sign which is insucient, see below).
further, in absence of exact wave functions for more excited levels one can nd the
rst (small) quantum correction to mass in the approximation of the quantum harmonic
oscillator. it is easy to see that at b  1 the (eective) potential

2(cid:19)2
v () =(cid:18)b

sinh2 

b
2

cosh 

9

(4.19)

has the single minimum

vmin = b/2 at min = 0.

then following to the h-expansion technique we shift the origin of coordinates in the
point of minimum (to satisfy  = 0 = 0 in absence of quantum oscillations), and expand v
in the taylor series to second order near the origin thus reducing the model to the oscillator
of the unit mass, energy /2 and oscillation frequency

 =

1

2qb(b  1).

therefore, the quantization rules yield the discrete spectrum

 =qb(b  1)(n + 1/2) + o(h2), n = 0, 1, 2, ...,

(4.20)

and the rst quantum correction to particle masses will be determined by the lower energy
of oscillations:

 =

1

2qb(b  1) + o(h2),

that gives the algebraic equation for m as a function of m and .

we can easily resolve it in the approximation

which is admissible for the major physical cases, and obtain

b  1  c/2  0,

 =

b
2

+ o(h2c/2),

that after considering of eqs. (4.13) and (4.18) yields

(m  )2 =

cm
4

+ o(h2c/2).

(4.21)

(4.22)

(4.23)

(4.24)

then one can seek for mass in the form m =  +  (  ), and nally we obtain the mass
of a particle with curvature (3.22) with rst-order quantum corrections (considering that m
is always dened up to a sign, besides  is dened up to a sign as well)

sign (m)m =   q sign (m) c

2

+ o(h2c/2),

where sign (m) is chosen such that after all we have a positive value

m = ||  q|c|

2

+ o(h2c/2),

(4.25)

i. e., quantization procedure restores the positivity of mass.

10

the nature of the justied choice of the root sign before the second term is not so
clear as it seems for a rst look, because there exist the two interfering points of view.
the rst (physical) one is: if we apply this formalism for the one-scalar 4 model [8] and
compare the result with that obtained in other ways [15], we should suppose the sign +
(or, at least, rajaraman made no mentions upon the choice of signs). however, the second,
mathematical, counterargument is as follows: the known exact spectra of the operators with
the qes potentials like (4.11) are split, as a rule by virtue of radicals, hence the signs 
might approximately represent such a bifurcation and thus should be unharmed.
if it is
really so, quantum uctuations should divide the classically unied particle with curvature
into several subtypes with respect to mass.

let us apply these results for our case. one can see that  is indeed dened up to a sign.
therefore, considering eqs. (2.5), (3.27) and (4.25), the mass of the quantum particle-like
solution (2.3) in the rst approximation is

m =q  2

 



2! ,

(4.26)

where for beauty we have omitted the magnitude symbol but suppose the r.h.s. to be posi-
tive. the problem of the obtaining of further corrections appears to be the mathematically
standard stourm-liouville problem for the razavi potential, all the more so it is well-like
on the whole axis and hence admits only the bound states with a discrete spectrum.

finally we note that because of the liouville model does not contain the vacuum state
 = 0, the obtained spectrum is nonperturbative and can not be derived by virtue of the
standard perturbation theory starting from the vacuum sector.

v. conclusion

let us enumerate the main results obtained. it was shown that the liouville eld theory
admits the particle-like eld solution which (weakly) diverges at innity but nevertheless
have the localized energy. besides, its mass depends on the constant which is additive to
the lagrangian and, therefore, does not appear in the equation of motion.

further, considering eld uctuations in the neighborhood of this soliton we ruled out
the action for it as a non-minimal point particle with curvature, thereby we have generalized
and polished the procedure of obtaining of brane actions. when quantizing this action as
the constrained theory with higher derivatives, it was shown that the resulting schroedinger
equation is the special case of the razavi equation having su(2) dynamical symmetry group
in the ground state. finally, we found the rst quantum correction to mass of the solution
in question which could not be calculated by means of series of the perturbation theory.
