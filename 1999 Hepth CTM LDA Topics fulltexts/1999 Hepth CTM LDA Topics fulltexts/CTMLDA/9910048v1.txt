abstract

as superstring solitons that carry neuveuschwarz charge can be
described in terms of gerbes, one expects non-abelian gerbes to ap-
pear e.g. in the exotic six-dimensional world-volume theories of coin-
ciding ns5 branes. we consider open bosonic strings on a space-time
that is branched in such a way that the b-eld is provided with the
same lie algebra structure as the world-volume gauge eld on a d-
brane. these considerations motivate a generalization of the cocycle
conditions and the transformation rules of an abelian gerbe in hy-
percohomology. the resulting system incorporates in a natural way
the ns two-form, the rr gauge eld, the chanpaton gauge eld,
the relevant gauge transformations and the holonomies associated to
wilson surface observables.

1 introduction

one of the most intriguing systems in string theory is that of r overlap-
ping ns5 branes [1] in the decoupling limit. the world-volume theory of
an isolated ns5 brane in type iia is given by a n = (0, 2) supersymmet-
ric theory in six-dimension, and it therefore involves self-dual antisymmetric
tensorelds [2, 3]. for several ns5-branes the dominant low energy degrees
of freedom are tensionless strings that arise in m-theory from m2-branes
suspended between m5-branes when the m5-branes world-volumes coincide.
these theories appear also in type iib compactied on k3 [4, 5], in which
formulation it becomes clear that the appearing tensionless strings are not
fundamental strings and that they have ade gauge symmetry. the heterotic
description involves a small e8 instanton [6] at the core of which gauge sym-
metry is enhanced. hence, it is natural to look for a way to describe these
systems in terms of a local quantum eld theory that involves a non-abelian
self-dual two-form in six dimensions. however, such a theory does not exist
[7] (cf. also [8]), and one needs an indirect or nonperturbative description.
wilson surfaces and loop equations in these systems have been studied in [9].
there is also a m(atrix) theory construction [10].

another interesting system involves the n = (1, 1) new gauge theories of
witten in six-dimensions [11]. in type iib they appear on a c2/zr orbifold
when nonperturbative closed string states appear from open strings that
start and end on points in c2 that are identied by the zr action. in low
energies the dynamics should however reduce to the six-dimensional infrared-
free n = (1, 1) yangmills theory.

the bulk origin of the anti-symmetric tensor eld is the neuveuschwarz
two-form b, the gauge eld of fundamental string charge. there are many
interesting phenomena connected to it, such as the appearance of noncommu-
tative yangmills theories in a constant background condensate [12, 13, 14].
if the curvature [h] of the b eld is a torsion class in integral cohomology,
d-brane charges can be classied [15] in a twisted version of k-theory [16],
and the chanpaton gauge elds appear as connections on a module of a
noncommutative algebra [17].
if the curvature is not a torsion class then
classication in terms of k-theory fails. for general curvature h, and thus
bound states that involve nontrivial ns ve-brane charge, the classication
problem is still open.

the proper mathematical framework for treating these three-form uxes
seems to be that of gerbes [18]. in all generality gerbes are sheafs of grupoids

2

[19, 20], but they can be understood more concretely as collections of lo-
cal principal bundles and their isomorphisms. as such they also include
the modules of noncommutative spaces [21] that appear in noncommutative
yangmills. abelian gerbes allow for a geometric interpretation in terms of
local line bundles [22, 23], and of hypercohomology [19, 24, 25]. the role of
hypercohomology is to provide a dierential geometric framework for study-
ing gerbes. physically this corresponds to nding the correct local degrees
of freedom for eld theory. however, this has been done until now only for
abelian gerbes. non-abelian gerbes do exist, actually the concept was orig-
inally introduced to formulate noncommutative cohomology. however, the
description uses holonomies and isomorphisms, which physically corresponds
to a wilson loop, or surface, observables.

recently it was shown [26] that the local line bundles of hitchin [23] in-
deed appear in eective type iia solutions in massive supergravity, when
ns5 branes and d6-branes are involved. the same considerations also gave
reason to suspect that gerbes should enter whenever ns charges are involved,
including the world-sheet theories on d-branes. however, these theories in-
volve non-abelian bundles on the world-volumes, and the abelian gerbes
are clearly not suited for describing them. in this article our aim is to nd a
straight forward non-abelian generalization of the abelian hypercohomology
underlying a general gerbe.

in order to do this we shall consider the quantum theory of strings on a
branched space-time or, more concretely, multivalued b-elds. these models
are adequate for describing strings both on an orbifold c2/zr in type iib de-
scription, and on r coinciding ns5 branes, when each one of them is carrying
an independent b-eld. this serves as a rough bosonic model for strings
in both six dimensional n = (0, 2) and n = (1, 1) systems as we are not
imposing self-duality constraints on the two-form. in fact, what follows does
not depend on the dimensionality of the brane, either. these arguments are
sucient for establishing what elds and which symmetries to expect in a
dierential geometry description of gerbe. a simple non-abelian generaliza-
tion of the cocycle conditions and symmetry transformations of an abelian
gerbe then yields a strongly constrained system which ts well in the physical
picture; it involves a collection of essentially abelian rr elds, and a chan
paton and ns two-form, which will turn out to be non-abelian, though in a
somewhat restricted sense. the result is suitably abelian as to allow us to
use some eld theory intuition in these systems, but display the underlying
non-abelian structure clearly enough, so that we see why and when we would

3

have to move from a local eld theory description to a nonperturbative one,
and to wilson surfaces.

the plan of the paper is as follows: in the next section we shall consider
string sigma-models and non-abelian currents on a branched space-time.
these results motivate in section 3 a non-abelian generalization of abelian
hypercohomology. in section 4 we show how the mathematical framework ts
together with what we know about superstring solitons, and their eective
low energy theories.

2 world-sheet actions and currents

we shall start by considering the bosonic string sigma-model in a framework
that naturally accommodates what we know about open string dynamics in
the presence of several d-branes.

consider d-branes qi, where i = 1, . . . , r. each of these branes carries
a chanpaton vector potential am,i, where m, n = 1, . . . , d are space-
time indices.
in the sigma-model this condensate eld is integrated over
the components of the boundary of the world-sheet  on dierent d-branes,
namely i. it is natural to think of the boundary as a vector in h 1(m)  h
where h is a vector space of dimension r with basis {ei}. similarly, a should
be thought of as an element of 1(m, h). one particular realization of this
is to take h to be the cartan subalgebra of some lie algebra g of rank r.

let us in particular consider the conguration where all of the d-branes
qi lie on top of each other, and the boundaries i coincide with  . then
we can write

z

a = xi

zi

am,i x m

i d = z 

(am , x m ) d .

(1)

where  denotes  for parallel and  for transverse coordinates to the d-
brane, and ( , ) is the killing form of the lie algebra. the index of the
boundary component became in this way formally an index of the at the
moment diagonal coordinate matrix x m .

let us next turn to the b-eld, and the full world-sheet. consider, for
simplicity, a world-sheet that is composed of disjoint cylinders ij that con-
nect the boundaries i and j. as we already attached the vectors ei
and ej to them it is natural to attach their dierence ei  ej =  to the
interpolating world-sheet , hence  = i  j = ei  ej = . in

4

particular in the case that the lie group g is just ar the vector  is one of
its roots.

in string theory there is only one bulk b-eld. however, it is natural
to associate dierent pull-backs of this eld bm n, for each component of
the world-sheet . for disjoint cylinders we can write without any loss of
generality

bm n, = (bm n , ) ,

(2)

where  is the coroot2. the pertinent world-sheet integrals can now be
written in the form

z

b = x

z

(b, ) .

(3)

2.1 non-abelian currents

until now all lie algebra has been used for keeping track of disconnected
components of the world-sheet. consider now a conguration where the
cylinders fuse into one geometrical object. let us take this limit in such
a way that the components of the elds bm n and am stay independent
on each component cylinder; this means that these elds eectively live on
dierent branches of space-time3. for the vector elds this is the standard
limit of coinciding d-branes. as to what concerns the bm n eld, this kind
of a situation could arise for instance at an orbifold such as c2/zr where
the dierent components come from dierent fundamental domains of the zr
action, though we do not have an explicit cft construction for this.

suppose further that we have two cylinders  and  that overlap on
one of their boundaries. in the limit we are taking both of the cylinders are
forced to occupy the same part of space-time, and as they are connected,
one is simply folding one on top of the other. however, as far as the b eld
is concerned we could have equally well started with the combined cylin-
der +. this means that even in the limit where one allows the b eld
be independent on dierent world-sheets we have to impose a consistency
condition

b + b = b+ .

(4)

2we follow the conventions of [27].
3this approach can be naturally formulated in connes noncommutative geometry [21].

it has been studied in open string context for instance in [28].

5

assuming (2) solves this condition, as anticipated.

the result of this analysis is hence that the string world-sheets on dierent
branches of space-time and the r dierent boundaries of the cylinders can
both be associated to the same cartan subalgebra of a lie algebra g =
ar, and the connecting cylinders to the roots of the same algebra. this
argument generalizes to world-sheets with an arbitrary number of boundary
components. for instance, given the boundary  = e1 + e2  e3 = v, the
correct b-eld proportional to (b, v). these world-sheets belong naturally
to some representation of g, with dynkin labels v. note also that we are not
restricted to the unitary series, but modding by a suitable symmetry we get
all of the simply laced lie algebrae in the ade series.

in order to learn how to describe these models in eective eld theory we
need a theory that can accommodate non-abelian b elds. this question
will occupy us for the rest of the paper. dene4 am = am,i h i and bm n =
bm n,i h i. it is also useful to introduce the non-abelian line element

dx m = d x m

i h i + dzx m

 e + dz x m

e  .

(5)

then the full non-abelian world-sheet action can be succinctly summarized
in

s = trz 

(gm n + bm n ) dx m dx n + trz 

am dx m .

(6)

we stress that the lie algebra indices i for a boundary component and  for
a connecting world-sheet arose geometrically when one evaluated coordinate
functions on dierent components of the world-sheet.

from open string interactions between r coinciding d-branes we know
[29, 30] that the gauge elds am can be extended to the full lie algebra g,
and that the scalars that appear as transversal coordinates take values in the
same space. in (6) this means that we should allow am and hence x m
take arbitrary values in the full lie algebra, and interpret

z 

(x  x( )) dx m

(7)

as the non-abelian current5 carried by a particle moving along  .

4h i are cartan generators,  the positive roots, and e their generators [27].
5note that x m denotes a sigma-model coordinate in all of the space-time directions;

the physical transverse coordinates of the brane are included in am .

6

extending this procedure to the bulk elds (on the world-sheet) bm n
and x m (z, z) is tempting. this would formally mean that we introduce new
degrees of freedom to the theory, namely the non-diagonal components of the
b-eld. these components couple to coordinate functions x m
 on dierent
world-sheets and would seem to correspond to strings propagating from one
world-sheet  or sheet of space-time  to another.

2.2 eective actions and symmetries
the action (6) describes the coupling of a macroscopic string  to the string
condensates. from the eective eld theory point of view it hence appears
as a non-abelian current. in order to address the dynamics of the full back-
ground elds a and b one produces the generating functional of their inter-
actions from the path integral evaluated in the presence of this current. in
the absence of the b eld the functional is just the wilson line [31]

ef [ac,bc] = d tr pexp  iz 

ace .

(8)

it can be evaluated assuming that one is allowed to neglect derivative terms
and commutators of the eld strength, and the result is tseytlins general-
ization of the dbi action [32].

this argument also tells us how to study non-abelian b-elds in string
theory. we like to simply insert the current (6), and ask what the resulting
generating function tells us about the dynamics of the eld. as the mi-
croscopic description for non-abelian b eld is lacking we have to rely on
indirect arguments, such as those that make use of the wilson line above, or
general underlying structures associated to the eld, gerbes.

in order to nd out what gauge symmetries we have, let us in particular
assume rst b = dc, where c is a diagonal, but make no restrictions on a.
then we can eliminate the b eld, and conrm that the path integral (8) is
invariant under the transformations a + c  k1(a + c + d)k.

the coordinate system in which b is diagonal in isospin indices tells us
what the geometrical direction in the isospin space should be  much like the
coordinate system in which the gauge eld of a d-particle is diagonal denes
what we mean by asymptotic space-time. however, when a is generally non-
abelian, there should not be a particularly preferred choice of this diagonal
direction because we can always change the basis in (6). hence, we may have
an independent freedom to change b by an isospin rotation.

7

in all, we have found three, as it seems, independent symmetries of the

theory

(g1) the generalized ns symmetry for a local one-form   1(q, h) where

h  g is the cartan subalgebra

a  a  
b  b + d .

(9)
(10)

this symmetry relies heavily on the fact that  is assumed diagonal
with respect to the basis (5).

(g2) the ordinary non-abelian gauge symmetry k : q  g

a  k1(a + d)k
b  b .

(11)
(12)

(g3) provisionally, we include also the choice of the physical direction in

isospin space h : q  g

a  a
b  h1bh .

(13)
(14)

note, however, that the non-abelian dbi action is not invariant under
this symmetry unless k = h.

next we shall try to combine these local symmetries and elds in a global
framework. for this we shall, however, have to nd out how to describe a
non-abelian gerbe in terms of dierential geometry.

3 hypercohomology

let us consider a space-time manifold x and a xed6 open cover {u}. the
isomorphism class of an abelian one-gerbe with connective structure and
curving is given by a two-cocycle in the hypercohomology of the complex

6neither the patches in the cover nor their intersections need to be contractible. cech-
cohomology does not depend on the cover, if the cover is ne enough. here we shall not
dwell on the dependence of the construction on the choice of cover. see, however, end of
section 3.3.

8

c   1  2 [24, 25]. a gerbe can hence be thought of as a two-
cocycle in the hypercohomology h2 of cech-cocycles with de rham forms
on the coecient sheaves [19]. a representative of this class is then a closed
two-cochain7

w = h g[0]

, a[1]

, b[2]

 i ,

(15)

and any two representatives of the class are connected by a shift with an
exact term, which will just turn out to be a gauge transformation. we shall
give the cocycle conditions and the gauge transformation rules below.

the cech-coboundary operator  acts by adding an index to h, such

that for instance

h = h h1

 h .

(16)

the cech-indices always remain antisymmetric, and 2 = 0. the zero-forms
are multiplicative and the higher de rham forms additive. the coboundary
operator of the complex introduced above is, when acting on an i-form,

d = dderham + (1)i cech .

(17)

the statement that w be closed under this coboundary operator dw = 0
gives the cocycle conditions

g g1

 g g1

 = 1
g1
 dg  a + a  a = 0
da + b  b = 0

on u ,

on u ,
on u .

gauge symmetry arises from shifting the gerbe w by an exact term

w = w + d ,

where  is a cochain in the lower complex c   1

(18)

(19)
(20)

(21)

(22)

7the index in square brackets denotes the de rham form-degree, and greek alphabet
is used to label the intersections of local patches where the object is dened. thus, for
instance, a[1]
 is a one-form dened on every twofold intersection of local charts, namely
u  u = u.

h h[0]

, [1]

 i .

9

this makes g into an ordinary cech-cocycle, a into a connection of a
line bundle dened on u, and h = db into a globally dened three-form.
concretely,

 = ghh1
g 
 = a + h1
a
b 
 = b + d .

 h
 dh   + 

(23)

(24)
(25)

similarly,  becomes a one-cocycle, if one imposes the condition d = 0.
it is easy to see that  is then a principal bundle with connection  and
transition functions h.

3.1 non-abelian gerbes

a straight forward attempt to simply add a lie algebra (or group) index to w
fails as it seems to be rather dicult to dene a non-abelian generalization
of the cocycle condition (18). indeed, there is no non-abelian cech-theory,
and hence a non-abelian hypercohomology formulation is absent as well.
gerbes were originally invented for studying non-abelian cohomology [18],
and they have appeared e.g. in [20] as dixmierduady sheaves of grupoids [19,
20]. abelian gerbes carry a natural dierential geometry, but this structure
has not been extended to the non-abelian case [19, 23]. for physics the
dierential complexes are rather essential as they correspond to physical
elds. the formulation in terms of grupoids corresponds rather to a qft
formulation in terms of wilson line and other holonomy operators [33].

the idea of the present construction comes from d-particle physics. there
a number of classical particles moving in the target space is described by
a diagonal matrix. in physical processes this coordinate matrix has to be
asymptotically diagonal  in some basis  but the dynamics of the theory
allow processes where also o-diagonal elements of the coordinate matrices
are excited. then the notion of local space-time vanishes and we are in the
realm of noncommutative geometry, or stringy geometry. in particular, one
could consider a process where the in-coming and out-going particles live in
dierent cartan subalgebrae of the pertinent group; then the denition of
space-time seems to have changed under the process.

in what follows we shall study a non-abelian generalization of the abelian
hypercohomology relevant for gerbes, which is in many respects still essen-
tially abelian. one circumvents the problem of dening non-abelian cech-

10

cohomology in formulae (18) and (23) by assuming that the system is actu-
ally abelian on threefold intersections. one can still allow non-abelian be-
haviour outside these by assumption isolated patches on the manifold. more
concretely we choose for each threefold intersection u a xed torus t
inside a lie group g, and assume that the cech two-cocycles g as well as
the restrictions of the gauge transformations h on any u take values in
the same xed torus. outside triple intersections we need not constrain these
transformations. however, we shall have to impose further assumptions on
other elds.

the obvious generalization of the one-form is now to make it a connection
on a principal g-bundle on u. the cocycle condition (19) can then be
accepted as is; for the xed torus part the condition is then just a collection
of abelian equations, for the rest of the lie algebra it reduces to a cocycle
condition that does not involve g. this restriction on the form of the
one-form a only constrains the eld on the triple intersections. under the
non-abelian gauge transformations we have to impose further

(ad(h)a) = 0 .

(26)

this condition can be solved by assuming that on three-fold intersections the
one-forms take values in the lie algebra of the xed torus t = lie(t).
finally, the two-form eld should be made lie algebra valued as well.

we are now ready to write down an ansatz for the non-abelian general-
ization of hypercohomology. our strategy will be to try to nd a non-abelian
generalization for the two-cochain w, together with the corresponding new
cocycle conditions and transformation rules. in addition to this two-cocycle
it will turn out that it is actually necessary to also include a xed one-cochain
v together with its transformation rules. this one-cochain need not be closed.
in the following, we consider then a xed two-cocycle and a xed one-cochain

w = h g[0]
v = h [0]

 i
, a[1]
, b[2]
 i ,

, [1]

and the action of the two cochains

 i
 = h h[0]
, [1]
 = h k[0]
 i

11

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

on them. here all of the one and two-forms take values in the lie algebra g,
and the functions in the corresponding lie group. as it will turn out, v de-
scribes a local principal bundle on each coordinate patch, and isomorphisms
between bundles on dierent though intersecting patches. if the bundle were
global, the cocycle conditions

 = 1
1
( + d)   = 0

(31)
(32)

would be satised everywhere.
in the abelian case the cocycle conditions
can be succinctly stated by saying that v is closed, dv = 0. the bundles v
could fail to be a global bundle if the class g =  were not trivial.
with this identication w actually measures to what extent the structure v
is local; it is hence an obstruction for making v a global bundle.

in this nested structure  acts as gauge transformations on  and v, and

both  and  act on w. in particular, the action of  on w is

 h ,

 = ghh1
g 
 = h1
a
b 
 = b + f () ,

 (a   +  + d)h ,

(33)

(34)
(35)

where f (x) = dx+xx. having v at our disposal we could have dened b 
 =
b + d() instead of (35), but this would lead to wrong transformation
properties in (44) later on. the gauge transformations  act according to

 = k1
h
 = k1


 hk
 ( + d)k .

on the local principal bundles. the action on w is both through

b 

 = k1

 bk ,

and through the action induced through  in (37).

the highest object obeys the cocycle condition dw = 0 namely,

g g1

 g g1

 = 1
g1
 dg  a + a  a = 0
f (a) + b  b = 0

on u ,

on u ,
on u .

12

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)
(41)

we call the collection of elds w a non-abelian one-gerbe if it satises these
consistency conditions.

where ever the zero-gerbes v and  obey the cocycle conditions dv = 0
or d = 0 they are actually locally dened principal g-bundles. the former
should not be assumed globally closed dv 6= 0, as otherwise it would indeed
extend to a global principal bundle, and the obstruction to this w, in which
we are actually interested, should vanish. also assuming  closed would
imply that it act at least in the abelian case trivially on w. also  has a
geometrical interpretation: it is just the set of gauge transformations of .

we should take care that the cocycle conditions dw = 0 are invariant
under the action of  and . the rst two conditions are still trivial, thanks to
the assumption that all relevant elds collapse to tori on triple intersections,
cf. (26). the last cocycle condition, however, gives a restriction on  and .
in all generality

0 = (cid:16)ad(h)  1(cid:17)f (a)  ad(h)(cid:16)d(a)    (cid:17)

+f () + (cid:16)ad(k)  1(cid:17)(b + f ()) ,

(42)

where the prime denotes the action of  on .
in the next section, we
shall simplify this condition. for this, however, we shall have to equip our
construction with some more structure.

3.2 consistency conditions

there is a way to restrict elds in order to make contact with the original hy-
percohomology. the idea is to restrict the covariant derivatives on the various
principal bundles so that they commute with the cech-coboundary operator8.
in what follows we derive the relevant commutative diagrams adding some
geometrical assumptions. note, however, that the rules of the previous chap-
ter were not derived, but arouse as a natural extension of abelian structure.
the analysis below serves hence as a justication for these denitions.

the cocycle condition (41) implies that b is a covariantly constant sec-
tion of the bundle where a is the connection. this means that under  for
 = 0 it transforms according to b 
 hk)b. on the other
8 the formula (26) is actually already an example of this: it just states that ad(h) =

 = ad(k1

ad(g). but the rhs is trivial because the elds are on a torus.

13

hand, we had already xed bs transformation properties in (38). hence
ad(h) = ad(k), which means that the diagram

[2]



ad(k)
 [2]





y

[2]





(43)

y

ad(h)
 [2]



should commute. this assumption relates the gauge transformations on
twofold intersections so that k = k = h.

in the abelian case we found the globally dened three-form h = db
in the present situation we can

useful for distinguishing dierent gerbes.
build a covariant three-form under  from b on u by setting

h = d()b .

(44)

the identity d(a)b = d()b would imply on twofold intersections that
h extend to a section of the local bundle associated to d(). if this local
bundle extends into a global one, h extends to its section. this compatibility
constraint is natural in the sense that it is just the covariantization of the
observation the the exterior derivative and the cech-coboundary operators
commute in the diagram

[2]



d()

y

[2]





(45)

y

d(a)
 [3]



however, it is a restriction on a and . the commutativity of the above
diagram translates into the condition

[a, b] = [, b] .

(46)

we shall give later an explicit example.

if instead of acting on b, we consider the action on the one-forms , the
result would be that the one-forms commute with each other [, ] = 0 and
with a, namely [, a] = 0. we shall be lead to this result presently, though
through another route. the same argument puts the one-forms  on the

setting h = k = 1 in (42) yields

f (a  ) = f (a)  f () .

(47)

we shall impose this formula as a restriction on a and . this leads to
f () = df () corresponding to the commutative diagram

one can verify that as was expected on general grounds, [a, ] = [, ] = 0.
now (42) is identically satised. we shall have to ensure that the condition
(45) is consistent with the transformation rules. this is not automatic, but
we have to make yet a forth restriction

d()f () = 0 ,

(49)

or, equivalently, [, f ()] = 0.

in summary, we have had to assume the commutativity of diagrams (43)
and (45), and that conditions (47) and (49) hold. all of these conditions are
geometrical, and t nicely together with abelian hypercohomology.

a solution

in order to see how these assumptions aect the dierential forms it is useful
to nd concrete examples that satisfy them. the geometrical picture that
arises from these considerations restricts the various elds in the following
way:

(c1) the connections   [1](u, g) dene locally a subspace ker ad() 
(u, g). we can now choose the forms b so that their restrictions
on u belong there. outside the double intersection there is no re-
striction.

(c2) having hence xed b on each u we have actually also xed f (a) =
b. because [a, da] = 0 the connection a and b should get their
values in the same cartan subalgebra.

15

(c3) on triple intersections u this cartan subalgebra should be a part of

the algebra t of a xed torus t.

(c4) the cech 2-cocycle g is built out of the transition functions  of the

local bundle v according to

g =  .

(50)

on u g is constrained to lie in the xed torus t. the torus could
vary as one moves over the triple intersection.

our construction is hence essentially abelian on triple and double in-
tersections. the non-abelianity of the construction lies outside the double
intersections, and in the way in which these various locally abelian con-
structions are related to each other. this means that the restrictions appear
rather as boundary conditions. the crucially non-abelian objects are the
transition functions , the one-forms  and the two-forms b.

to see how this works, consider, for instance, how ker ad() viewed as
a collection of sections of the local principal bundle v transforms on a three-
fold intersection u as we transport it around: the transition functions of
the local bundle v combine under this tour into g as dened in (50). this
holonomy does not need to be trivial as we did not assume that the local
bundles combine into a global one. this far we did not impose much structure
on v. let us now suppose further that g happens to be an element of t
in order to satisfy condition c4 above. in addition, assume that on four fold
intersections the g are compatible in the sense that g = 0. despite the
notation, (50) does not imply that g would be exact (or even closed) as a
collection of abelian cech cocycles, because the transition functions  are
not in general abelian.

it turns out [20] that the denition (50) of g produces the right three-
index object even if the transition functions  are just general isomorphisms
between principal bundles on dierent charts. then the cocycle condition
has to be modied, however, and there does not seem to exist at present
representations of the underlying sheaves of grupoids in terms of dierential
geometry on them, or hypercohomology.

for concreteness, let us consider a toy model on a triple intersection u123,
with the group g = su(2). suppose 1 = x(1  2), 2 = x(1 + 2),
and 3 = x(1 + 2). then the transition functions can be taken constants
12 = i1, 23 = i3, and 31 = i2. the resulting holonomy is gijk = ijk.

16

the dierences in the b eld are b12 = (b2  b1)1 + (b2 + b1)2, b23 =
(b3 + b2)(1 + 2), and b31 = (b1 + b3)1 + (b1 + b3)2. in order
to nd the connections a we have to assume b1 = 0. then we can choose
one-forms aij = ijkak(1 + 2). this also xes the embedding of the torus
tijk  su(2).

transformations

given in the above sense consistent data w, v, let us now see what symmetries
,  are left.

(s1) on each patch  acts as the gauge symmetries of the bundle v.

(s2) on double intersections u these transformations are xed to coincide

with the corresponding transformations of the gerbe k = h.

(s3) on triple intersections also the transformations of the gerbe h are xed

to respect the tori t

(s4) the translations  and their dierences  belong on u to a cartan

subalgebra ker ad()  (u, g).

in the previous toy model example the gauge transformations (s1) and
(s2) make  and a into ordinary connections on the respective coordinate
patches. the remaining shift symmetry  can be found just as the bi were
found above, except that now [, ] = 0. it follows, 1 = 0, 2 = a(1 + 2),
and 3 = b(1 + 2). it acts then on the triple intersections just as in the
abelian case, along the xed torus. assuming a2 = 0 we can also choose
1 = aa3(1  2) and 2 = 3 = 0.

3.3 geometrical interpretation

the non-abelian gerbe w found in the previous section provides a tool to
study the set of local, non-abelian principal bundles v. the local symmetry
of the bundle is frozen on double intersections so that gauge transformations
on both charts are identical. this transformation then acts also on the gerbe
w. the two-form b can be assumed to commute with the connection  on
two-fold intersections. b provides us an abelian connection a on double
intersections. the translations  are abelian on triple intersections as well,
and act on a in the same way as in the abelian case.

17

the gerbe w would then look exactly like rank g copies of abelian gerbes,
were it not for the fact that b is generally lie algebra valued outside double
intersections, and that h can mix the diagonal elements of a on double
intersections. the crucial non-abelianity resides in the principal bundles v,
and w should be seen as an almost abelian obstruction for extending v into
a global bundle.

if the local bundles in v are trivial, then its sections can be conjugated
to the cartan subalgebrae xed on various double intersections. the transi-
tion functions  do still not have to be trivial, but they act as isomorphisms
between these tori. in particular, g is an automorphism of the torus asso-
ciated to , and maps the torus back to itself thus permuting the diagonal
elements. in this way, the gerbe can be used to describe a braid.

limitations
cech-cohomology does not depend on the choice of cover if the cover is ne
enough [34]. however, in our discussions the cover is very particular. for
instance, if there were enough three-fold intersections to cover the whole
space the whole construction would collapse to r copies of abelian gerbes.
for our considerations it is, however, quite sucient to know that there does
exist a cover independent formulation of non-abelian gerbes [18, 20] that
describes obstructions to extend local bundles into global ones. we choose
one of these congurations together with a cover that is as simple as possible
but still carries the interesting information. in other words we smooth the
system as much as possible, and try to push the obstructions to trivializing
it into as small and isolated neighbourhoods as possible.

we have found a very particular dierential geometry description of these
objects as well. in that it seems to give an extension of abelian hyperco-
homology the restrictions on the elds are under control. one should ask,
however, whether the parametric tori t are actually necessary data. the
observation that g can become non-abelian in general gives hope that
there actually might be a formulation where this data becomes superuous.
however, from the physical point of view the tori seem to be necessary, much
as the physical cartan subalgebrae in d-particle scattering, as we shall see
presently.

4 string backgrounds and gerbes

in this section we make contact with the string theory considerations of sec-
tion 2.1, where we coupled the ns two-form elds and the chanpaton vector
elds to a non-abelian current carried by a world-sheet. three dierent sym-
metries acted on these elds (g1), (g2), and (g3) in the notation of section
2.2. we also have an essentially abelian gauge eld from the rr sector, and
a gauge symmetry associated to it.

on the geometrical side there is associated to the gerbe a local principal
bundle v = [, ]. this should be identied with the chanpaton bundle on
a d-brane. the obstruction to extend this bundle is g. the gauge symmetry
(g3) is then just the action of .

on two-fold intersections we have the essentially abelian gauge eld a.
this should be the rr gauge eld for the d-particle, or the d6-brane. the
chanpaton gauge transformations were correlated to the rr gauge trans-
formations h on these two-fold intersections.
if the action of these gauge
transformations is not abelian it seems that an isospin rotation on the chan
paton sector induces a redenition of which cartan subalgebra the rr elds
live.

we already noticed that the gauge transformations h in  = [h, ] connect
the chanpaton transformations and the rr gauge transformations. also
the transformations generated by  play an important role. as they shift the
b-eld by the curvature f () cf. (35) they are the natural generalization of
the ns symmetry (g1). the  transformation also acts on the rr eld in the
way ns transformation does. as was pointed out in [26] the abelian version
of the cocycle condition (41) guarantees that the right gauge invariant eld
strength is the same as in massive iia supergravity, namely

f [2] = f (a) + b

(51)

it then readily follows that the two-form b in w is the ns two-form.

the ns gauge invariant combination in open string theory b + f (acp )
appears here as well, but in the form f = b + f ().
its curvature is
h = d()f , as it should be, but  does not seem to implement the ns
symmetry (g1) correctly. fortunately, all of the previous calculations on
double intersections remain unchanged even if we extend the action of 
onto v. then we have to assume again [, ] = [, ] = 0, which makes  into
an eectively abelian connection so that f (  ) = f ()  f (), and f is
again invariant.

19

however, this would be pushing the ns symmetry too far. though ns
symmetry is present for abelian currents coupled to the world-sheet  which
we have again correctly reproduced above in hypercohomology  it is not
there for non-abelian currents, as it heavily relies on the abelianity of
f (acp ). one should therefore think of the ns-symmetry (g1) rather as
a freedom to redene the connection  by shifting it with suitably abelian
form. our construction therefore necessitates a nontrivial non-abelian ex-
tension of the ns-symmetry. there is exactly the same interplay between
abelian and non-abelian currents in the eective supergravity lagrangians
and the above generalized hypercohomology.

let us nally consider conserved charges. the local bundles v are clas-
sied by the chern class ch(f ()). the bundles in w also have nontrivial
rst chern class ch1(f (a)). the invariant quantity associated to b is
tr h = tr d()b. consider its integral over a sphere s3 that is divided into
two discs u, u, whose boundaries s2 coincide. then

qns = zs 3

tr h = zs 2

tr (b  b) = zs 2

tr f (a) .

(52)

thus ns charge is non-trivial, if trf (a) has monopole number, i.e. there
are d6-branes [26]. the ns charge is well dened under the  shifts as well,
because

zs 2

tr f () = zs 2

tr d  = 0 .

(53)

for xed bases of rr elds these formulae yield charges that do not depend
on  or the choice of homology cycles, even if the traces are dropped in (52).

5 conclusions

we started by studying a branched cover of space-time and showed how
the ns two-form elds are made to carry the same lie algebra indices that
the chanpaton gauge elds have. much in the same way that the latter
elds are promoted to non-abelian lie algebra elds in the case of a stack
of coinciding d-branes, we argued that there should appear additional light
degrees of freedom from strings that connect d-branes on dierent branches
of the space-time. a dbi action argument was also used to indicate which
symmetries there should be present.

20

the curvature of the ns b eld appears on the level of eective super-
gravity as the characteristic class of a gerbe. in order to set the stage for
addressing dynamical issues concerning this non-abelian b eld it is there-
fore necessary to generalize the abelian hypercohomology construction. this
we did, and the resulting structure incorporates strikingly well, and in par-
ticular without introducing unphysical degrees of freedom, all the relevant
supergravity elds and symmetries.

this construction sheds light on the diculties encountered in trying to
describe perturbatively for instance the exotic n = (0, 2) theories in six di-
mensions. in the case of non-abelian yangmills the right object to study in
supergravity seems to be the wilson line, i.e. the holonomies of the principal
bundle.
it seems therefore that the right strategy to attack the dynami-
cal problem here should be, analogously, to understand the holonomies of
the gerbe using the techniques developed here. these very same holonomies
arise also in guaranteeing that the string world-sheet measure is anomaly
free. for instance the analysis in [33] was concerned in essentially dening
the the holonomy of an abelian gerbe.
