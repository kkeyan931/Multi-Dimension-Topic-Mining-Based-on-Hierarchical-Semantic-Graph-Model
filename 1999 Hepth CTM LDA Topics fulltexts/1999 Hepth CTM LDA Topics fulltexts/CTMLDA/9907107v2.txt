abstract

using a manifestly supersymmetric formalism, we determine the general struc-
ture of two- and three- point functions of the supercurrent and the avour current
of n = 2 superconformal eld theories. we also express them in terms of n = 1
superelds and compare to the generic n = 1 correlation functions. a general dis-
cussion of the n = 2 supercurrent supereld and the multiplet of anomalies and
their denition as derivatives with respect to the supergravity prepotentials is also
included.

1 introduction

superconformal eld theories in various dimensions have been intensively studied for many
years. the conjecture of maldacena [1], which in its simplest form relates n = 4 super-
yang-mills theory in four dimensional minkowski space to n = 8 supergravity in ve
dimensional anti-de-sitter space has led to a renewed interest in superconformal eld the-
ories in diverse dimensions with maximal and less than maximal supersymmetry. here we
will be interested in n = 2 generic superconformally invariant theories. particular exam-
ples can be realized as world-volume theories on d3 branes in the presence of d7 branes
[2]. these theories have also been studied in the context of the maldacena conjecture [3].
a more general interest in n = 2 supersymmetric theories, not necessarily conformally
invariant, arises within the context of seiberg-witten theory and its string/m-theory
realization. for reviews, see e.g. [4, 5, 6].

a general ecient formalism to analyse correlation functions of quasi-primary elds
has been developed since the early days of conformal eld theory. some important recent
contributions have been provided by osborn and collaborators. we refer to their papers:
to ref.
[7, 8] for the non-supersymmetric case in an arbitrary number of dimensions. a
complete analysis of the n = 1 supersymmetric case in d = 4 was presented in [9] (see also
[10]). in ref. [11] park constructed the building blocks of correlators of quasi-primary elds
for arbitrary n in four dimensions and for (p, 0) superconformal symmetry in d = 6. the
formalism is powerful for applications whenever there exist o-shell supereld formulations
for superconformal theories, and such formulations are known in four dimensions for
n = 1, 2, 3.

in this paper we are going to analyse correlation functions of conserved currents in
n = 2, d = 4 superconformal eld theory in a manifestly n = 2 supersymmetric lan-
guage. to this end we review in sect. 2 the formalism of osborn and park, specializing
to the case of n = 2.
in sect. 3 we apply this to the computation of various two-
and three-point correlation functions, involving the n = 2 supercurrent j and avour
currents lij. the three-point function of the supercurrent is shown to be the sum of
two linearly independent superconformal structures whose coecients are related to the
anomaly coecients, denoted by a and c in [12]. whereas for n = 1 there exist two
independent structures for the three-point function of the avour current, there is only
one for n = 2. this is a consequence of the fact that n = 2 theories are non-chiral.
we also analyse mixed three-point functions and, in particular, show that the three-point
function hj j liji vanishes, as a consequence of n = 2 superconformal symmetry. in

1

sect. 4 we describe the reduction of our results to n = 1 superelds. the main body of
the paper ends with a brief discussion. we have included a few technical appendices to
make the paper self-contained. in app. a we review the weyl and the minimal n = 2
supergravity multiplets in harmonic superspace and present a new parametrisation of the
supergravity prepotential (it was sketched already in part by siegel [13]) which is most
convenient for any consideration involving the supercurrent and the multiplet of anoma-
lies. in app. b we describe the procedure to generate the supercurrent and the multiplet
of anomalies as functional derivatives with respect to supergravity prepotentials. in app.
c we compute the supercurrent and the multiplet of anomalies for general renormalizable
n = 2 super-yang-mills models.

the multiplets of currents and anomalies for n = 2 extended supersymmetry in four
space-time dimensions were introduced by sohnius [14] twenty years ago. he considered
the simplest n = 2 supersymmetric model  the hypermultiplet with 8 + 8 o-shell
degrees of freedom [15], and showed that the energy-momentum tensor mn belongs to
a supermultiplet (called, by analogy with n = 1 susy [16], the n = 2 supercurrent)
which (i) in addition, contains the su(2) r-current j(ij)
m , the n = 2
supersymmetry currents ji
m, where  = , , the central charge current cm as well as
some auxiliary components of lower dimension; (ii) is described by a real scalar supereld
j (z) of mass dimension 2. the central charge current is also part of the multiplet of
anomalies which contains in addition m
m)  along with an auxiliary
triplet. the multiplet of anomalies is described by a real isotriplet supereld t (ij)(z),
t ij = tij, which is subject to the constraint

 , d 

where da = (a , di
i ) are the n = 2 supersymmetric covariant derivatives, i = 1, 2.
both j and t ij turn out to be invariant with respect to the central charge transforma-
tions. the supercurrent conservation law reads

dijj + i t ij = 0

dijj  i t ij = 0

(1.2)

 , dij = d(i


where dij = d(idj)
dj) . the constraint (1.1) means that t ij is a so-called
n = 2 linear multiplet. such a multiplet contains a conserved vector and the reality
condition for t ij is equivalent to the absence of the second (fundamental) central charge
(which is the case for all n = 2 irreducible supermultiplets).

a nice feature of the n = 2 multiplet of anomalies is that its supersymmetric structure
is completely analogous to that of a n = 2 supereld containing a conserved avour

2

current of a n = 2 supersymmetric eld theory. such a avour current supereld l(ij)(z),
lij = lij satises the same constraint,

d(i

 ljk) = d(i

 ljk) = 0 .

(1.3)

the similarity is not accidental. the point is that lij is generated by coupling matter
hypermultiplets to a gauge vector supermultiplet. on the other hand, the source for t ij is
a vector multiplet which gauges the central charge and belongs to the n = 2 supergravity
multiplet.

the structure of the n = 2 supercurrent has been used by sohnius and west [17]
in their proof of niteness of the n = 4 sym theory which was based on anomaly
considerations. it is worth pointing out that the supercurrent conservation law in quantum
n = 2 super yang-mills theories [19] (see also [20])

dijj =

can be brought to the form (1.2) by a nite local shift of j , resulting in

(1.4)

(1.5)

dijj =

g

(cid:0)dijw 2  dij w 2(cid:1) .

here w is the n = 2 yang-mills eld strength, and (g) is the beta-function of the gauge
coupling constant.

another consequence of the structure of the n = 2 supercurrent follows from the
fact that j presents itself the multiplet of superconformal currents. then, noethers
procedure tells us that n = 2 conformal supergravity should be described by a real scalar
prepotential g(z) [21, 22] to which the matter supercurrent is coupled. in app. a.1 we
will show how such a prepotential arises in the harmonic superspace approach to n = 2
conformal supergravity [23, 24]. this point requires some comments. many years ago,
gates and siegel [25] showed that the rst minimal n = 2 poincare supergravity (in
the terminology of the third reference in [26]) is described, at the linearized level, by a
single unconstrained spinor supereld i(z).3 their conclusion is in perfect agreement
with the fact that (i) the corresponding superspace dierential geometry [27] contains two
independent strengths - a covariantly chiral symmetric bi-spinor w (n = 2 super weyl
tensor) and a spinor ti ; (ii) the supergravity equation of motion reads

3the harmonic superspace origin of this prepotential has been recently revealed by zupnik [29].

in [25] it was argued that n = 2 conformal supergravity should be described by the same
prepotential i but with a larger gauge freedom. this led gates, grisaru and siegel [30]
to postulate that the n = 2 supercurrent be a spinor supereld

j i

.

(1.7)

as will be described below, this puzzle can be resolved in the harmonic superspace ap-
proach to n = 2 supergravity [23, 24]. there, the prepotential g is part of a larger
harmonic multiplet g(z, u) with a huge gauge symmetry. the gauge freedom can be xed
in part either to leave a single real unconstrained g(z), the leading component of g(z, u)
in its harmonic fourier expansion, or to bring g(z, u) to the form

g(z, u) = dij

j + conjugate

(z)u+

i u

(1.8)

with i(z) the gates-siegel prepotential. therefore we have j i
 j for all (renor-
malizable) n = 2 matter systems. the details of this discussion are provided in apps. a
and c.

manifestly supersymmetric techniques to study the quantum dynamics and to compute
the superconformal anomalies for n = 2 matter systems in a supergravity background
are not yet available. in xspace, there exists an exhaustive description of general n = 2
supergravity-matter systems [26, 28].
in superspace, there exist elaborated dierential
geometry formalisms [27, 31, 32] corresponding to n = 2 conformal supergravity and the
three known versions of n = 2 poincare supergravity. moreover, the unconstrained pre-
potentials and the gauge group of n = 2 conformal supergravity were found in harmonic
superspace [23, 24], and this analysis was extended to describe dierent versions of n = 2
poincare supergravity [24, 33] and most general supersymmetric sigma models in curved
harmonic superspace [34]. what is still missing is the detailed relationship between the
dierential superspace geometry of n = 2 supergravity [27, 31, 32] and its description in
terms of the unconstrained prepotentials given in [23, 24]. another missing prerequisite is
the denition of the n = 2 supercurrent and multiplet of anomalies as the response of the
n = 2 matter action (in the full nonlinear theory) to small disturbances in supergravity
prepotentials, similar to what is well known in n = 1 supersymmetry (see [35] for a
review)

j  =

h   ,

t =

;

(1.9)

here h   and  are the n = 1 gravitational supereld and chiral compensator, respec-
tively. such a denition is of primary importance, since it allows us to compute correlators

4

with supercurrent insertions simply as functional derivatives of the renormalised eective
action with respect to supergravity prepotentials. in the appendices we will close some of
these gaps. in particular, using the harmonic superspace approach to n = 2 supergravity
[23, 24], which we briey review, we introduce a new parametrisation of the supergravity
prepotentials which allows us to easily obtain the n = 2 analogue of (1.9).

before closing this introductory section, we would like to comment on the n = 1
multiplets contained in j and t ij (see also [30]). for that purpose we introduce the
n = 1 spinor covariant derivatives d  d1
1 and dene the n = 1 projection
u|  u(x, 
)|2=2=0 of an arbitrary n = 2 supereld u. it follows from (1.1) and
(1.2) that j is composed of three independent n = 1 multiplets

d2j = 0

d j  = 2

3 dt .

(1.12)

the latter equation shows that j  is the n = 1 supercurrent and t the corresponding
multiplet of anomalies. the spinor object j contains the second supersymmetry current,
the central charge current and two of the three su(2) currents, namely those which
correspond to the symmetries belonging to su(2)/u(1). finally, the scalar j contains the
current corresponding to the special combination of the n = 2 u(1) r-transformation
and su(2) z-rotation which leaves 1 and 1 invariant. the central charge current is
in n = 1 supersymmetry, associated with
also contained in l, which is no accident.
any internal symmetry is a real linear supereld containing the corresponding conserved
current; l is such a supereld for the central charge. similarly, in a superconformal theory
(t ij = 0) the real scalar j becomes a linear supereld and, hence, contains a conserved
current.

as is seen from (2.8), the above formalism cannot be directly applied to the case
n = 4 which is treated in more detail, e.g., in [11]. in what follows, our considerations
will be restricted to n < 4, with special emphasis on the choice n = 2 later on.

that x12 is antichiral with respect to z1 and chiral with respect to z2). as a consequence
of (2.19), they transform semi-covariantly with respect to the superconformal group

in the case n = 2, we have at our disposal the su(2)invariant tensors ij = ji and
ij = ji, normalized to 12 = 21 = 1. they can be used to raise and lower isoindices

c i = ijcj ,

ci = ijc j .

that unitarity of u(z12) now implies

uij(z12) = uij(z12) .

3 correlators of n = 2 quasi-primary superelds

3.1 quasi-primary superelds

in n -extended superconformal eld theory, a quasi-primary supereld oa
i (z), carrying
some number of undotted and dotted spinor indices, denoted collectively by the super-
script a, and transforming in a representation t of the rsymmetry su(n ) with respect
to the subscript i , is dened by the following innitesimal transformation law under
the superconformal group

 oa

i (z) =  oa

here m and m   are the lorentz generators which act on the undotted and dotted
spinor indices, respectively, while ri
j are the generators of su(n ). the parameters q and
q determine the dimension (q + q) and u(1) rsymmetry charge (q  q) of the supereld,
since for a combined scale and u(1) chiral transformation

(cid:19) .

(3.2)

(3.3)

in this paper we are mainly interested in two- and three-point correlation functions of
the supercurrent j (z) and a avour current supereld l(ij)(z) in n = 2 superconformal
theory. the reality condition j = j and the supercurrent conservation equation

dij j = dijj = 0

uniquely x the superconformal transformation law of j

j (z) =  j (z)  2 ((z) + (z)) j (z) .

(3.4)

(3.5)

as for the avour current supereld, the reality condition lij = lij and the conservation
(analyticity) equation

d(i

 ljk) = d(i

 ljk) = 0

(3.6)

x its transformation law to

lij(z) =  lij(z) + 2i (i

k(z) lj)k(z)  2 ((z) + (z)) lij(z) .

(3.7)

similar to the n = 1 consideration of [44], the transformations (3.5) and (3.7) can
also be obtained as invariance conditions with respect to combined dieomorphisms and
weyl transformations in the superconformal theory coupled to a n = 2 supergravity
background.

3.2 two-point functions

according to the general prescription of [9, 11], the two-point function of a quasi-primary
supereld oi (carrying no lorentz indices) with its conjugate oj reads

hoi(z1) oj (z2)i = co

ti
(x12

j (u(z12))
2)q(x21
2)q

(3.8)

12

with co a normalization constant. here t denotes the representation of su(n ) to which
oi belongs.

for the two-point function of the n = 2 supercurrent, the above prescription leads to

using the identity

hj (z1) j (z2)i = cj

2x21

2 .

where 8

d4 12(z1  z2) ,

d4 =

dij dij ,

3

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

we immediately see that the supercurrent conservation equation is satised at non-coincident
points

d1

ijhj (z1) j (z2)i = d1

ijhj (z1) j (z2)i = 0 ,

z1 6= z2 .

(3.12)

in this paper we leave aside the analysis of singular behaviour at coincident points, see
[9] for details.

in the case of two-point function of the n = 2 avour current supereld lij, the above

prescription gives

hli1j1(z1)li2j2(z2)i = cl

ui1

i2(z12)uj1

j2(z12) + ui1
2x21
2

x12

j2(z12)uj1

i2(z12)

.

(3.13)

because of eq. (2.39), the relevant conservation equation is satised

d1 (k1hli1j1)(z1)li2j2(z2)i = d1 (k1hli1j1)(z1)li2j2(z2)i = 0

(3.14)

for z1 6= z2.

3.3 three-point functions

according to the general prescription of [9, 11], the three-point function of quasi-primary
superelds o(1)

i1 , o(2)

i2 and o(3)

i3 reads

ho(1)

i1 (z1) o(2)

i2 (z2) o(3)

i3 (z3)i =

j1 (u(z13)) t (2)
t (1)
i1
2)q1(x31
2)q1(x23
(x13

j2 (u(z23))
2)q2

i2
2)q2(x32

hj1j2i3(z3) .

(3.15)

13

here hj1j2i3(z3) transforms as an isotensor at z3 in the representations t (1), t (2) and
t (3) with respect to the indices j1, j2 and i3, respectively, and possesses the homogeneity
property

hj1j2i3(  x,  ,  ) = 2a 2ahj1j2i3(x, , )
a  2a = q1 + q2  q3 ,

a  2a = q1 + q2  q3 .

(3.16)

in general, the latter equation admits a nite number of linearly independent solutions,
and this can be considerably reduced by taking into account the symmetry properties,
supereld conservation equations and, of course, the supereld constraints (chirality or
analyticity).

3.3.1 the n = 2 supercurrent

we are going to analyse the three-point function of the n = 2 supercurrent for which we
should have

hj (z1) j (z2) j (z3)i =

1
2x23

2x32

x13

2x31

2 h(z3) ,

h(  x,  ,  ) = ( )2h(x, , )

(3.17)

where the real function h(z3) has to be compatible with the supercurrent conservation
equation and the symmetry properties with respect to transposition of indices. since
h(z3) is invariant under u(1)  su(2) rtransformations, we have h(x3, 3, 3) =
h (x3, x3), as a consequence of (2.29).

when analysing the restrictions imposed by the n = 2 conservation equations, it
proves advantageous, following similar n = 1 considerations in [9], to make use of confor-

(3.19)

where t(x3, 3, 3) is an arbitrary function.

with the aid of these operators, one can prove the identity

(3.20)

and similar ones involving the operators d1 ij, d2

ij and d2 ij.

now, the supercurrent conservation equation (3.4) leads to the requirements

dij h(x3, 3, 3) = dij h(x3, 3, 3) = 0

(3.21)

and to similar ones with ds  qs. since d i and qi coincide with partial fermionic
derivatives the above equations imply

2
 j h(x, , ) =

i

2
i   j

  

h(x, , ) = 0 ,

(3.22)

and therefore the power series of h(x, , ) in the grassmann variables s contains
only few terms.

the general solution for h(z3) compatible with all the physical requirements on the

three-point function of the n = 2 supercurrent reads

h(x3, 3, 3) = a (cid:18) 1

let us comment on the derivation of this solution. first, it is straightforward to check

acts on x3 and x3 by x3   x3. the second term in (3.23) is a solution to (3.21)
due to the special n = 2 identity

2 and x3

dij  = dij    = 0 .

(3.25)

(3.28)

(3.29)

using relations (2.39) and (3.19), the avour current conservation equations (3.6) are
equivalent to

d (i1h abc
q (i2h abc

k1l1)(k2l2)(i3j3)(x, , ) = d  (i1h abc
|k1l1|k2l2)(i3j3)(x, , ) = q  (i2h abc

k1l1)(k2l2)(i3j3)(x, , ) = 0 ,
|k1l1|k2l2)(i3j3)(x, , ) = 0 .

(3.30)

in contrast to n = 1 supersymmetry [9], the three-point

correlation function of avour currents does not admit an anomalous term proportional
to an overall completely symmetric group tensor, dabc = d(abc). this is a consequence of the
fact that the n = 2 conservation equations (3.6) do not admit non-trivial deformations;
see also below.

3.3.3 mixed correlators

the three-point function involving two n = 2 supercurrent insertions and a avour n = 2
current supereld, turns out to vanish

hj (z1) j (z2) lij(z3)i = 0 .

(3.33)

on general grounds, the only possible expression for such a correlation function compatible
with the conservation equations and reality properties should read

with d being a real parameter which can be related, via supersymmetric ward identities,

3.4 example: n = 4 super yang-mills

let us consider the harmonic superspace formulation for n = 4 super yang-mills theory

s[v ++, q+, q+] =

1

2g2 trz d4x d4 w 2 

1

g2 trz du d (4) q+(cid:0)d++ + i v ++(cid:1) q+ . (3.36)

17

since the hypermultiplet q+ belongs to the adjoint representation of the gauge group, we
can unify q+ and q+ in an isospinor

 = (q+, q+) ,
q+

q+  =  q+

 = (q+, q+) ,

(q+

 )= q+ 

(3.37)

such that the action takes the form (with  = d++ + i v ++)

s =

2g2 trz d4x d4 w 2

2g2 trz du d (4) q+ 


 q+


(3.38)

this form makes it explicit that the theory manifestly possesses the avour symmetry
suf (2), in addition to the n = 2 automorphism group sur(2)  ur(1). the full group
sur(2)  ur(1)  suf (2) is the maximal subgroup of sur(4)  the rsymmetry group
of the n = 4 sym  which can be made manifest in the framework of n = 2 superspace
formulation. while the conserved currents for sur(2)  ur(1) belong to the supercurrent

j =

ij(z) ,

(3.39)

(3.40)

with  a the pauli matrices; here the latter equality is valid on shell. the fact that hj j li
vanishes identically whereas hllj i is generically non-zero is now a simple consequence
of group theory. in fact, group theory restricts the structure of the correlation function
of three n = 4 sur(4) currents to be proportional to tr (titj tk) where ti is a sur(4)
generator. by considering the action of the n = 2 ur(1) symmetry, one nds that the cor-

rect embedding ur(1)  sur(4) is diag(+1, +1, 1, 1). also sur(2)l suf (2)  sur(4)

is embedded as diag(sur(2), suf (2)). the result stated above now follows immediately.
three- and four- point functions of the avour currents (3.40) have been computed at two
loops in [45].

4 reduction to n = 1 superelds

from the point of view of n = 1 superconformal symmetry, any n = 2 quasi-primary
supereld consists of several n = 1 quasi-primary superelds. having computed the
correlation functions of n = 2 quasi-primary superelds, one can read o all correlators
of their n = 1 superconformal components.

18

when restricting ourselves to the subgroup su(2, 2|1)  su(2, 2|2), all matrix elements

of h(z) (2.19) with i, j = 2 should vanish, and hence we have to set

1

2 = 2

1 = 0 ,

i 1

1 = i 2

2 =    .

(4.1)

therefore, the n = 1 u(1) r-transformation is a combination of n = 2 u(1) and special
su(2) r-transformations.

keeping eq. (4.1) in mind, from the n = 2 supercurrent transformation law (3.5) one

deduces the transformation of the n = 1 currents (1.10)

j =  j  2 ( + ) j

j =  j + 

j  (3 + 2) j

j  =  j  + (

 

 +  



)j   3 ( + ) j  .

(4.2)

these superconformal transformations are uniquely singled out by the relevant conserva-
tion equations

d2 j = d2 j = 0
d j = d2 j = 0
d j  = d  j  = 0 .

(4.3)

in the case of n = 2 avour current supereld lij, its most interesting n = 1 component
containing the conserved current,

l  i l12| = l

satises the standard n = 1 conservation equation

d2 l = d2 l = 0 .

and, therefore, its superconformal transformation rule is similar to j,

l =  l  2 ( + ) l .

the same n = 1 transformation follows from (3.7).

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

19

4.1 two-point functions

using the explicit form (3.9) of the n = 2 supercurrent two-point function, one can read
o the two-point functions of the n = 1 quasi-primary superelds contained in j 5

hj(z1) j(z2)i = cj

hj(z1) j (z2)i = 4i cj

(4.7)

these results are in agreement with n = 1 superconformal considerations [9]. similarly,
the two-point function of the n = 1 avour current supereld (4.4) follows from (3.13)

hl(z1) l(z2)i = cl

2x21

2 .

x12

(4.8)

4.2 three-point functions

we now present several n = 1 three-point functions which are encoded in that of the
n = 2 supercurrent, given by eqs. (3.17) and (3.23). first of all, for the leading n = 1
component of j one immediately gets

(4.9)

the second term in (3.23) does not contribute to this three-point function, since  is
equal to zero for 2 = 2 = 0.

the derivation of three-point functions involving the n = 1 supercurrent is technically
more complicated. in accordance with eq. (1.10), j  is obtained from j by applying
the operator

[d2

and, then, the grassmann variables 2 and 2 have to be switched o. one can prove the

(4.14)

(4.15)

eq. (4.14) presents itself a nice consistency check.

in n = 1 superconformal eld
theory, the three-point function hj  j  li of two supercurrents with one avour current
supereld l is uniquely determined up to an overall constant [9]. any n = 2 supercon-
formal eld theory, considered as a particular n = 1 superconformal model, possesses a
special avour current supereld, l = j. therefore, the only possible arbitrariness in the
structure of the correlation function hj  j  ji is an overall constant. but j and j 
are parts of the n = 2 supercurrent j , and hence the three-point function hj  j  ji
follows from hj j j i. since the latter contains two linearly independent forms, given
in eq. (3.23), there are two possibilities: (i) either a-term or b-term in (3.23) does not
contribute to hj  j  ji; (ii) both a-term and b-term produce the same functional con-
tribution to hj  j  ji modulo overall constants. eq. (4.14) tells us that option (ii) is
realized.

the calculation of hj j j i is much more tedious. to derive this correlation func-
tion, one has to act with the operator (4.10) on each argument of hj (z1)j (z2)j (z3)i. but
since by construction h in (3.17) is a function of z3, it turns out to be quite dicult to
control superconformal covariance at intermediate stages of the calculation when acting
with   on the third argument of hj (z1)j (z2)j (z3)i. a way out is as follows. one rst

our nal relations (4.16) and (4.18) perfectly agree with the general structure of the
three-point function of the supercurrent in n = 1 superconformal eld theory [9].

respectivley. we obtain6

a =

b =

(4.20)

in n = 1 supersymmetry, a superconformal ward identity relates the coecient in
the two-point function of the supercurrent (4.7) to the anomaly coecient c as follows [9]

cj =

84 c .

in terms of the coecients a and b this relation reads

2
2 cj = 8a  3b .

(4.21)

(4.22)

in n = 1 supersymmetry, there also exists a superconformal ward identity which

of a current supereld l. a nice consequence of our consideration is that n = 2 super-
symmetry allows us to x up this ward identity without working it out explicitly. the
point is that the n = 2 supercurrent contains a special current supereld, that is j.
therefore, from the rst relation in (4.7) and eq. (4.13) we deduce

d =

(4.23)

let us turn to the three-point function of the n = 2 avour current supereld given
by eqs. (3.28) and (3.32). from these relations one reads o the three-point function of
the n = 1 component (4.4)

(4.25)

it is worth noting that ward identities allow to represent f abc as a product of cl and the
structure constants of the avour symmetry group, see [9] for more details.

in n = 1 superconformal eld theory, the three-point function of avour current

superelds l contains, in general, two linearly independent forms [9]:

the second term, involving a completely symmetric group tensor dabc, reects the presence
of chiral anomalies in the theory. the eld-theoretic origin of this term is due to the fact
that the n = 1 conservation equation d2 l = d2 l = 0 admits a non-trivial deformation

d2 hlai  dabc w b  w c


when the chiral avour current is coupled to a background vector multiplet. eq. (4.24)
tells us that the avour currents are anomaly-free in n = 2 superconformal theory. this
agrees with the facts that (i) n = 2 super yang-mills models are non-chiral; (ii) the
n = 2 conservation equation (3.6) does not possess non-trivial deformations.

finally, from the three-point function (3.35) we immediately deduce

our main objective in this paper was to determine the restrictions of the general structure
of two and three point functions of conserved currents imposed by n = 2 supercon-
formal symmetry. this was done in a manifestly supersymmetric formalism. the results

24

are contained in sects. 3.2 and 3.3. in particular, we have shown that the threepoint
function of the supercurrent allows for two independent structures. in the appendices we
show that the minimal supergravity multiplet can be described in harmonic superspace by
two real unconstrained prepotentials: harmonic g and analytic v++
. this is the supereld
parametrisation which allows us to derive the supercurrent and multiplet of anomalies as
the response of the matter action to small disturbances of the supergravity prepotentials.

5

in this paper, the results about the structure of the correlation functions were com-
pletely determined by n = 2 superconformal symmetry. the results for specic models
only dier in the value of the numerical coecients. they can be determined in pertur-
bation theory using supergraph techniques.

an interesting open problem is the issue of non-renormalization theorems for the

correlation functions of conserved currents. for a recent discussion for n = 4, see [46].

there exists an o-shell formulation of n = 3 sym theory, ref.

[47]. since n = 3
and n = 4 sym are dynamically equivalent, it can be used to get further restrictions
and possible non-renormalization theorems on the n = 4 correlation functions.

another interesting problem is the structure of superconformal anomalies of n = 2
matter systems in a supergravity background. such anomalies are responsible for the
three-point function of the n = 2 supercurrent studied in sect. 3. the results of apps.
a and b provide the natural prerequisites for the analysis of the n = 2 superconformal
anomalies.

a supergravity multiplets

in this appendix we briey review harmonic superspace and discuss the weyl multiplet
and the minimal supergravity multiplet in some detail.

25

in rigid supersymmetry, all known n = 2 supersymmetric theories in four space-time
dimensions can be described in terms of elds living in n = 2 harmonic superspace
r4|8  su(2)/u(1) introduced by gikos [39]. along with the standard coordinates
z = (xm, 
i ), this superspace involves the internal harmonic variables
i which are constrained by u+iu
u
i = 1 and dened modulo phase rotations with charge
1. harmonic superspace possesses a supersymmetric subspace , with half the fermionic
coordinates of the full superspace, dened to be spanned by the variables

i , i

(a.1)

(a.2)

analytic subspace (a.1) is closed under n = 2 super poincare and superconformal trans-
formations [39, 23].
in addition, it is invariant under the generalized conjugation   
dened as [39]:

the fundamental importance of analytic subspace (a.1) lies in the fact that the n = 2
matter multiplets (hypermultiplets and vector multiplets) can be described in terms of
unconstrained analytic superelds living in the analytic subspace (a.1).

in harmonic superspace, there is a universal gauge principle to introduce couplings to
yang-mills and supergravity [39]. consider the rigid supersymmetric operators d++ and
d dened as

d =   2im m +  
 ,

(a.3)

a , 

 = / . the fundamental property of
where  = ui/ui , m = /xm
d++ is that if  is analytic, i.e. if +
  = 0, then so is d++. it turns our that switching
on the yang-mills or supergravity couplings is equivalent to the requirement that d++
must be deformed to acquire a connection or nontrivial vielbeins, in such a way that the
deformed operator still preserves analyticity.

a.1 weyl multiplet

in this subsection we start with reviewing the harmonic superspace realization [23, 24] of
the weyl multiplet [26] describing n = 2 conformal supergravity and comprising 24 + 24
7eq. (a.2) denes the so-called analytic basis of harmonic superspace, while the original basis {z, u
i }
is called central. in what follows, we mainly use the analytic basis and do not indicate the subscript a
explicitly.

26

o-shell degrees of freedom. then, we will present a new parametrisation for the conformal
supergravity prepotentials and describe several gauge xings.

according to [23, 24], the conformal supergravity gauge elds are identied with the

vielbein components of a real covariant derivative

d++ = ++ + h++m m + h(+4) + h+ +


(a.4)

that is required to move every analytic supereld into an analytic one. hence h++m 
(h++m, h+++, h+++ ) and h(+4) are analytic, while h+   (h+, h+ ) are uncon-
strained superelds. the supergravity gauge transformations act on d++ and a scalar
supereld u via the rule (d0 = u+i 

u+i  ui 

ui )

d++ = [ + , d++] + ++d0 ,

u = ( + )u

(a.5)

where

 = m m + ++ ,

 =  +


such that every analytic supereld of u(1) charge p, (p), remains analytic

(p) = (p) ,

+
 (p) = +

 (p) = 0 .

(a.6)

(a.7)

therefore, the parameters m = (m, +, + ) and ++ are analytic, while   =
(,  ) are unconstrained superelds.

the supergravity gauge transformations are induced by special reparametrisations of

harmonic superspace

 m = m (, u) ,
u+i = ++(, u)ui ,
  =  (, , u)

ui = 0 ,

(a.8)

which leave the analytic subspace invariant.

since d++ contains a number of independent vielbeins, it is far from obvious in the
above picture how to generate a single scalar supercurrent from the host of harmonic
vielbeins.
in addition, there is a technical complication  some vielbeins possess non-
vanishing values in the at superspace limit (a.3). to nd a way out, it is sucient to
recall the standard wisdom of supereld n = 1 supergravity [40]. in eqs. (a.4) and (a.6)
the covariant derivative and gauge parameters are decomposed with respect to the super-
space partial derivatives. to have a simple at superspace limit (which would correspond

27

to vanishing values for all the supergravity prepotential), it is convenient to decompose
d++ and ,  with respect to at covariant derivatives d, dm = (m, d
 ) and
d+

 , d

 = / ; i.e.

d++ = d++ + h ++m dm + h (+4)d + h + d+


 = m dm + ++d

 =  d+


(a.9)

(a.10)

in such a parametrisation, the vielbeins h ++m
where h (+4) = h(+4), ++ = ++.
and and h (+4) are no longer independent, but they are instead expressed via a single
unconstrained supereld. really, since we must have

for any analytic supereld (p), using the algebra of at covariant derivatives leads to

d+

 d++(p) = 0 ,

d+

 h ++   2i

d+
 h +++  
h (+4) = 0 ,

h +++  = 0 ,

 h (+4) = 0 ,
d+
h +++  = 0 .

d+


the general solution to these equations (and their conjugates) reads

h ++  = i d+ d+ g ,

h +++ =  1

8 d+( d+)2g ,
h (+4) = 1

16(d+)2( d+)2g  (d+)4g

(a.13)

similar to h ++m and h (+4), the gauge parameters m and ++ in eq. (a.10) are

expressed via a single real unconstrained supereld l(, , u), l = l, as

  = i d+ d+ l ,
8 d+( d+)2l ,

+ =  1

++ = (d+)4l ,

+  = 1
8

d+ (d+)2l .

(a.14)

from eq. (a.5) one can read o the transformations of h ++m , h (+4) and h +  :

h ++m =  h ++m  d++m ,

h (+4) =  h (+4)  d++++ ,

h +  = ( + )h +   +   d++  ,

(a.15)

28

where

since the parameters   are unconstrained, h +  can be gauged away

d++ = d++  h + d+
 .

h +  = 0 .

then, the residual gauge freedom is constrained by

d++  = +  .

(a.16)

(a.17)

in what follows, we will assume eq. (a.16), hence d++ and d++ coincide.

from (a.15) it is easy to read o the transformation law of g. it is sucient to notice

the identities

[d+

 , ] = 0 ,

[d+

 , d++] = 0

(a.18)

where the latter holds for (a.16) only. therefore, from eqs. (a.12), (a.14) and (a.15) we
deduce

g = g  d++l .

now, eqs. (a.13) and (a.19) determine the full supergravity gauge group.

it is instructive to examine (a.19) in linearized theory

g = d++l .

in the central basis d++ coincides with ++, and g(z, u) and l(z, u) are

g(i1inj1jn)(z)u+

i1    u+

inu

j1    u

jn ,



xn=1

l(i1in1j1jn+1)(z)u+

jn+1

g(z, u) = g(z) +

l(z, u) =



xn=1

(a.19)

(a.20)

(a.21)

where g(z), g(i1i2n)(z) and l(i1i2n)(z) are unconstrained superelds. since d++u+
and d++u
be gauged away to arrive at the gauge condition

i = 0
i , eq. (a.20) tells us that all the components g(i1i2n), n = 1, 2, . . ., can

i = u+

d++g = 0 .

(a.22)

the surviving gauge freedom consists of those combined transformations (a.13) and
(a.19) which preserve the above gauge condition, that is

g(z) =

1
12

dijij(z) +

1
12

dij ij(z)

(a.23)

29

where ij(z) is the leading component in the harmonic expansion of (z, u) (a.13).
the linearized prepotential of conformal supergravity g(z) and its gauge freedom (a.23)
is precisely what follows from the structure of the n = 2 supercurrent discussed in the
introduction.

instead of imposing the gauge condition (a.22), one can take a dierent course. since

h (+4) is analytic, it follows from (a.15) that we can achieve the gauge [23, 24]

h (+4) = 0

which restricts the residual gauge freedom to

d++++ = 0 .

now, from (a.12) and (a.24) we get

g = d+

 + d+  



(a.24)

(a.25)

(a.26)

where 
 (z, u) is an unconstrained harmonic spinor supereld of u(1) charge 1. eq.
(a.25) denes a linear analytic supereld in conformal supergravity background. in lin-
earized theory, the general solution of eq. (a.25) is well known:

++ = (d+)4nu

i u

j dijv (z) + u

i u

j

dij v (z)o .

(a.27)

therefore, from here and (a.14) we can completely specify the residual gauge freedom:

l(z, u) = d+(3)



(z, u) + d+  (3)



(z, u) + u

i u

j (cid:16)dijv (z) + dij v (z)(cid:17)

(a.28)

(z, u). using (3)



transformations, we

with an unconstrained harmonic parameter (3)
can gauge away all 



 but the leading component in its harmonic expansion



 (z, u) = i

(z)u

i

.

(a.29)

i

(z) is nothing but the gates-siegel prepotential [25].

a.2 minimal multiplet

the so-called minimal supergravity multiplet [26] is obtained by coupling the weyl multi-
(, u). v ++
plet to an abelian vector multiplet which is a real analytic supereld v ++
(, u)
transforms as a scalar under (a.5) and possesses its own gauge freedom [39, 23, 24]

5

5

v ++

5 = d++5

30

(a.30)

with 5(, u) an arbitrary real analytic parameter. this vector multiplet is a gauge eld
for the central charge  that can be understood as the derivative in an extra bosonic
coordinate x5,  = /x5, on which matter supermultiplets may depend. for matter
supermultiplets with central charge, the denition (a.4) should be replaced by

d++

 = d++ + v ++

5 

(a.31)

and the transformations (a.5) extend to

d++

 = [ +  + 5 , d++

 ] + ++d0 ,

u = ( +  + 5)u .

(a.32)

the limit of rigid supersymmetry corresponds to the choice when all hvielbeins in

(a.9) vanish and v ++

5

can be brought to the form

that is why v ++
eld z(x) dened by

5 must in general satisfy a global restriction that its scalar component

v ++

(a.34)

be non-vanishing over the space-time, z(x) 6= 0. then, ordinary local scale and chiral
transformations (contained in (a.10)) can be used to bring z(x) to its at form (a.33)
(all remaining components in (a.34) turn out to be gauge degrees of freedom). let di
,
d i and d be the at covariant derivatives with central charge. in the central basis,
d coincide with , while di

 and d i are

di

  ,

d i =

 i (im) m  i  i  . (a.35)

in the analytic basis which we mainly use, d+
are [39]: d

 coincide with d+
 , d = d + i (()2  ()2).

  2i 

 = d

 and the other derivatives

the above global restriction on v ++

gets automatically accounted for if, instead of
using the representations (a.9) and (a.10), we start decomposing the harmonic covariant
derivative and gauge parameters with respect to the at covariant derivatives with central
charge

(a.37)

j u j , with m = (m i

then, the at superspace limit would correspond to v ++
5 = 0. however, such a represen-
tation is sensible only if the matter multiplets u under consideration are characterized
by a constant central charge, u i = im i
j ) a constant mass matrix
independent on the supergravity prepotentials. such a situation appears, for examples,
for hypermultiplets described by unconstrained analytic superelds. however, it is well
known that there exist n = 2 supermultiplets which contain nitely many auxiliary elds
and possess an intrinsic central charge. this means that setting the central charge to
be constant is equivalent to putting the theory on shell (for example, this applies to the
hypermultiplet with 8 + 8 o-shell degrees of freedom). to have a nite number of compo-
nent elds in such theories, one has to impose special constraints on primary superelds
u in order that the series {u, u, u, . . .} containes only few functionally independent
representatives. the constraints imposed must determine not only the eld content but
also specify the o-shell central charge as a nontrivial functional of the supergravity pre-
potentials. for such theories, representation (a.36) is useless, because the at derivatives
d and dm involve the curved central charge.

in representation (a.36) the requirement

d+

 d++

 (p) = 0

for any analytic supereld (p), implies that the set of equations (a.11) should be extended
to include one more relation

32

with 5 being an arbitrary real analytic supereld.

in the gauge (a.16), h ++m , h (+4) and v ++

5

transform as follows

h ++m =  h ++m  d++m ,

h (+4) =  h (+4)  d++++

v ++5 =  v ++

5  d++5

and hence

v++

5 =  v++

5  d++5 .

(a.42)

(a.43)

as concerns the prepotential g, from (a.42) we again deduce its transformation (a.19).

b supercurrent and multiplet of anomalies

given a matter system coupled to the minimal supergravity multiplet, we dene the
supercurrent and multiplet of anomalies

j =

s
g

,

t ++ =

s
v++

5

(b.1)

with s being the matter action. here the variational derivatives with respect to the
supergravity prepotentials are dened as follows

s =z d12z du g

s
g

+ z du d (4) v++

5

s
v++

5

.

(b.2)

as is seen, the supercurrent j is a real harmonic supereld, j = j , while the multiplet of
anomalies t ++ is a real analytic supereld, t ++ = t ++, d+
 t ++ = 0. by construction,
both j and t ++ are inert with respect to the central charge transformations.

the action is required to be invariant under pre-gauge transformations (a.40). this

means

1

s =

4z d12z du j (d+)2 + iz du d (4)t ++ (d+)4 + c.c.
= z d12z du (cid:26) 1

(d+)2j + i t ++(cid:27) + c.c. = 0

4

for arbitrary . as a consequence, we get

1
4

(d+)2j + i t ++ = 0 ,

1
4

( d+)2j  i t ++ = 0 .

(b.3)

33

the action must be also invariant under the superspace general coordinate transfor-
mation group. the group acts on the prepotentials g and v++
according to eqs. (a.19)
and (a.43) respectively. these transformations should be supplemented by those of the
matter superelds. on shell, the invariance of s with respect to (a.19) and (a.43) turns
out to imply very strong restrictions on j and t ++, in addition to the conservation law
(b.3). let us describe here the implications of general coordinate invariance for the sim-
plest and most interesting case of at superspace when g = v++
5 = 0 (in general, the
analysis is basically the same but requires more involved technical tools). for such a
background eqs. (a.19) and (a.43) reduce to the linearized transformations

5

g = d++l ,

v++

5 = d++5 .

now, the invariance of s with respect to the l transformations means

s = z d12z du (d++l) j =z d12z du ld++j = 0

for arbitrary l, and hence

d++j = 0 .

(b.4)

(b.5)

(b.6)

we see that the matter supercurrent in minkowski superspace is uindependent, j =
j(z). on the same ground, the invariance of s with respect to the central charge 5
transformations implies

the general solution of this equation in the central frame reads

d++t ++ = 0 .

t ++(z, u) = t (ij)(z)u+

i u+

j

.

(b.7)

(b.8)

since t ++(z, u) has to be analytic, the multiplet of anomalies t (ij)(z) satises eq. (1.1).

c matter models in supergravity background

in this section we will describe n = 2 supersymmetric models, both with intrinsic central
charge and models with constant central charge.

c.1 models with intrinsic central charge

we will use analytic densities (p)

{w} transforming as

(p)

{w} = ( + 5)(p)

{w} + w  (p)

{w} ,

34

d+

 (p)

{w} = d+

 (p)

{w} = 0

(c.1)

where the variation of the analytic subspace measure du d (4) with respect to general
coordinate transformations (a.8) is given by the analytic supereld

  (1)m dm m + d++ ,

d+

  = 0 .

(c.2)

we will be mainly interested in analytic densities (p)
impose the constraint

{p/2} on which we can consistently

(cid:18)d++ + v ++

5  +

1
2

p ++(cid:19) (p)

{p/2} = 0

where the analytic connection ++ is dened by [33]

++ = (1)m dm h ++m + dh (+4) ,

d+

 ++ = 0

and transforms as

++ = ++  d++  2++ .

(c.3)

(c.4)

(c.5)

the above constraint turns out to be gauge covariant only if p = 2w.

to construct a supersymmetric action, let us specify an analytic density (2)

{1}  l++

subject to the constraint (c.3). then, the integral

s =z du d (4) v ++

5 l++

(c.6)

proves to be invariant under the supergravity gauge transformations. indeed, since l++
is an analytic density of weight 1, and v ++
is a scalar supereld, their product transforms
into a total derivative

5

(cid:0)v ++

5 l++(cid:1) = (1)m dm(cid:0)m v ++
= (d+)4d(cid:0)lv ++

5 l++(cid:1) + d(cid:0)++ v ++
5 l++(cid:1)

5 l++(cid:1) ,

under (a.8), and the action (c.6) remains invariant. here we have used eq. (a.14). as
concerns the central charge transformations, we have

(c.7)

(c.8)

(c.9)

v ++

5 = d++5

l++ = 5l++

and, modulo total derivatives, the variation of s vanishes

s =z du d (4) 5(cid:0)d++ + v ++

5  + ++(cid:1) l++ = 0

as a consequence of c.3. the above prescription to construct supersymmetric invariants
is a natural generalization of the action rule given in [41] for n = 2 rigid supersymmetric
theories with gauged central charge.

35

(cid:18)d++ + v ++

5  +

1
2

++(cid:19) q+ = 0

(c.10)

now, let us turn to a hypermultiplet with intrinsic central charge in conformal super-
gravity background. the hypermultiplet is described by a constrained analytic supereld
q+  (1)
{1/2} and its conjugate q+. it can be shown that the analyticity of q+ and the
basic constraint

determine the central charge  as a nontrivial operator depending on the supergravity
prepotentials. the hypermultiplet dynamics is described by the lagrangian

l++ =

1
2

q+


 q+  i m q+q+ .

(c.11)

the corresponding equation of motion enforces the central charge to be constant [42]

s
q+ = 0

=

q+ = i m q+ .

(c.12)

c.2 models with constant central charge

let us consider a dual, for applications more useful description of the hypermultiplet in
terms of an unconstrained analytic supereld q+(, u) and its conjugate q+(, u). the
dynamical supereld is dened to transform as a density of weight 1/2

q+ = ( + 5) q+ +

1
2

q+

and its central charge is chosen to be constant

q+ = i m q+

o shell. the dynamics is described in curved superspace by the action

s = z du d (4) (cid:26) 1

2

q+


d ++q+ + i m v ++

5 q+q+(cid:27)

(c.13)

(c.14)

(c.15)

which reduces to that given in [24] for m = 0. the action is invariant under all local
symmetries. the corresponding equation of motion reads

s
q+ = 0

=

(cid:18)d++ + v ++

5  +

1
2

++(cid:19) q+ = 0 .

(c.16)

comparing eqs. (c.10) and (c.12) with (c.16) and (c.14), we see that the two hyper-
multiplet models are equivalent. but the equation of motion in one model turns into the
o-shell constraint in the other and vice versa.

36

the basic advantage of this model is that o the mass shell the dynamical variable
q+ is an unconstrained supereld independent on the supergravity prepotentials. that
is why one can readily vary the action with respect to these prepotentials. using eqs.
(a.12) and (a.39) gives

q+d++q+ + i m v ++

we therefore obtain

5 q+q+ = q+d++q+ + (d+)4nq+gdq+o + i m v++

5 q+q+ .

(c.17)

j = 

1
2

q+


d q+ ,

t ++ = i m q+q+ .

(c.18)

let us compute the supercurrent and multiplet of anomalies (c.18) in at superspace

where the equation of motion (c.16) becomes

d++q+ = 0 .

(c.19)

in the central basis, d coincide with , and the on-shell superelds read

q+ = qi(z)u+
i

,

q+ = qi(z)u+i ,

qi = qi .

(c.20)

now, eq. (c.18) leads to

j = 

1
2

qi qi ,

t ++ = t ij(z)u+

i u+

j

,

t ij = i m q(iqj) .

(c.21)

what we have derived is exactly the n = 2 supercurrent and multiplet of anomalies found
by sohnius [14].

the above consideration can be generalized to the case of a general renormalizable

super yang-mills system in curved superspace with action

s =

1

2g2 trz d4x d4 e w 2 z du d (4) q+(cid:26) 1

2


d ++ + iv ++ + i v ++

5 m(cid:27) q+ . (c.22)

i

here v ++ = v ++
(, u)ri is the yang-mills gauge supereld, and w the corresponding
covariantly chiral strength; e denotes the n = 2 chiral density [32, 43]. the constant mass
matrix m is required to be hermitian and to commute with the gauge group, [v ++, m] = 0.
in at superspace, the corresponding supercurrent and multiplet of anomalies read

j =

1

g2 tr(cid:0) ww(cid:1) 

q+


 q+ ,

1
2

t ++ = i q+mq+

(c.23)

where  denotes the proper gauge covariant harmonic derivative. in the central basis,
 coincides with , and on shell

q+ = qi(z)u+
i

,

37

(i

 qj) = (i

 qj) = 0

(c.24)

 and  

where i
from eq. (c.23) we get

i denote ordinary u-independent gauge covariant derivatives. therefore,

j =

1

g2 tr(cid:0) ww(cid:1) 

1
2

qiqi ,

t ij = i q(imqj) .

(c.25)

it is worth noting that (c.22) describes a curved superspace extension of the n = 4 super
yang-mills theory if m = 0 and if q+ transforms in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group.

it is well known that n = 2 poincare or de sitter supergravity cannot be formulated
solely in terms of the minimal multiplet [26, 42]. to get a consistent action for poincare
supergravity, one has to couple the minimal multiplet to an auxiliary multiplet whose role
is to compensate some local transformations. such a compensator may contain nitely
many [26] or an innite number [24] of o-shell component elds. the three known
minimal formulations [26] comprising 40 + 40 o-shell degrees of freedom and their com-
pensators are: (i) nonlinear multiplet; (ii) hypermultiplet with intrinsic central charge
(c.10); (iii) improved tensor multiplet. in principle, one can elaborate on non-minimal
supergravity formulations with n + n o-shell degrees of freedom, 40 < n < . finally,
there exists the maximal formulation [24] whose compensator is a single q+ hypermultiplet
considered in this subsection. in all cases, the supergravity action is a sum of the action
of the minimal multiplet and that for the compensator [26, 24].

no matter what compensator we choose, it does not enter the minimal classical action
(c.22) corresponding to general n = 2 renormalizable sym models. therefore, the choice
of compensator has no impact on the structure of the supercurrent at the classical level.
the main eect of the compensator is to assure self-consistency of the dynamics of the
full supergravity-matter system.

if we give up the requirement of renormalizability, the compensator can tangle with
n = 2 matter. this is the case for general quaternionic o-shell sigma models in curved
harmonic superspace [34]. but then we deal with eective eld theories (e.g. low energy
string actions) and can treat the compensator as part of the matter sector coupled to
n = 2 conformal supergravity.

as an example of more general dynamics, let us consider the n = 2 rigid supersrym-

metric sigma model

s = 

1

2 z du d (4) (cid:26)q+


d ++q+ +


2

(q+q+)2(cid:27)

(c.26)

with  the coupling constant. the bosonic sector of this model describes the taubnut
gravitational instanton with a scalar potential generated by the central charge. to lift

38

the model to curved superspace, one has to couple the dynamical superelds not only
to the minimal supergravity multiplet, but also to an unconstrained analytic density 
[23, 24]. as a result, the coupling to supergravity is characterized by j and t ++ given,
in the at superspace limit, by (c.18) along with the analytic supereld t (+4) = s/ =
 
2 (q+q+)2. the conservation equations (b.3) and (b.7) remain unchanged, but eq. (b.6)
gets modied to

d++j + dt (+4) = 0

(c.27)

and therefore j becomes u-dependent (note that (d++)2j = 0, since d++(q+q+) =
d++(q+q+) = 0 on shell).
