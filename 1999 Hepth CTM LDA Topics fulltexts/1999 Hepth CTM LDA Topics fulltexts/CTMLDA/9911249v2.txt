abstract

we quantize pure 2d yang-mills theory on an arbitrary riemann
surface in the gauge where the eld strength is diagonal. twisted
sectors originate, as in matrix string theory, from permutations of the
eigenvalues around homotopically non-trivial loops. these sectors,
that must be discarded in the usual quantization due to divergences
occurring when two eigenvalues coincide, can be consistently kept if
one modies the action by introducing a coupling of the eld strength
to the space-time curvature. this leads to a generalized yang-mills
theory whose action reduces to the usual one in the limit of zero curva-
ture. after integrating over the non-diagonal components of the gauge
elds, the theory becomes a free string theory (sum over unbranched
coverings) with a u(1) gauge theory on the world-sheet. this is shown
to be equivalent to a lattice theory with a gauge group which is the
semi-direct product of sn and u(1)n . by using well known results
on the statistics of coverings, the partition function on arbitrary rie-
mann surfaces and the kernel functions on surfaces with boundaries
are calculated. extensions to include branch points and non-abelian
groups on the world-sheet are briey commented upon.

1 introduction

the solution of pure two-dimensional yang-mills theory (ym2 in the follow-
ing) on a general riemann surface has been known for some time. it was
obtained on the lattice in [1, 2], and in the continuum in [3, 4, 5]. for in-
stance, the partition function of the u(n) theory on a surface of genus g
and area a is

(1)

z =xr

(dr)22g e 1

2 g2a cr ,

where the sum runs on the irreducible representations r, of dimension dr
and quadratic casimir cr, of the u(n) group.

this solution allowed gross and taylor [6] to describe the u(n) ym2
theory, in the large n limit, as a particular type of string theory. in fact
they could show that in this limit the partition function (1) counts distinct
maps from world-sheets of genera g to the target space represented by the
base manifold of genus g.

recently, a dierent way to formulate ym2 on a torus or a cylinder as
a string theory has been suggested [7, 8], and in this paper we are going
to extend this formulation to arbitrary riemann surfaces. this proposal is
inspired by matrix string theory [9, 10]. in matrix string theory one considers
the n = 8 supersymmetric ym2 theory, dened on a cylinder. this theory
contains eight scalar elds xm with their supersymmetric partners  in
the adjoint representation of the u(n) gauge group. in the limit gym  
all these elds commute and can be simultaneously diagonalized. the n
eigenvalues of xm take the role of the eight transverse coordinates describing
the world-sheets of a gas of free superstrings. the eigenvalues, however, can
be subjected to a permutation as one goes around the compact direction
of the cylinder, giving rise to twisted sectors in correspondence with the
conjugacy classes of the symmetric group sn . strings of dierent lengths are
present in each sector, and correspond to the cycles of the permutation.

in [7] we showed that twisted sectors appear naturally in pure ym2 on
a torus or a cylinder if one chooses the so-called unitary gauge [11], namely
the gauge in which the eld strength is diagonal. their inclusion leads to a
partition function that is dierent from the standard one of [2], has a richer
structure and is closely related to the partition function of the whole matrix
string theory [12, 13].

however, in higher genus riemann surfaces there are always divergences
associated to the twisted sectors in correspondence of points where two eigen-

1

values of the eld strength coincide. a rather ad hoc regularization was sug-
gested in [5], whose eect is to suppress all non-trivial sectors in order to
reproduce the standard result.

we propose here to study a generalized ym2 (in the sense of [14, 15])
in which such divergences do not occur, and the twisted sectors can be con-
sistently kept into account. this can be achieved by introducing a suitable
coupling of the eld-strength to the riemann curvature of the space-time
manifold1. the action of the generalized theory reduces to the one of ordi-
nary ym2 for at surfaces. in the generalized theory the twisted sectors are
in one-to one correspondence with the unbranched n-coverings of the sur-
face, and the original u(n) gauge group reduces to an abelian gauge group
for each connected component of the covering. for the torus and the cylin-
der the results of [7] are reproduced. all previous results are discussed in
sections 2 and 3. in section 4 we show that, after integration over the non
cartan components of the gauge elds, the theory can be described as a lat-
tice gauge theory of a group gn dened as the semi-direct product of sn and
u(1)n . by using known results on the statistics of coverings [6, 16], we de-
rive in sections 5 and 6 the expression for the partition function on surfaces
without boundaries and the kernel function for surfaces with an arbitrary
number of boundaries.
in section 7, with the conclusions, we outline the
main features of the extension of the present theory to the case of interacting
strings (branched coverings) and to strings with a non-abelian gauge group
on the world-sheet.

2 unitary gauge and matrix string theory

consider a two-dimensional gauge theory dened on a riemann surface m,
with or without boundaries, and with gauge group g, for instance u(n).
assume that the theory contains at least one eld f transforming in the
adjoint representation of g; in the case of u(n), f is a n  n hermitian
matrix. a possible gauge choice consists in choosing f with values in the
cartan subalgebra of g, that is, in the u(n) case, in choosing f diagonal
(unitary gauge). in fact it is always possible at each point x of m to nd a
1this coupling can be interpreted as the result of the gauge elds being dened on the

tangent space (like fermions) rather than being one-forms on the base manifold

2

gauge transformation g(x) that casts f into a diagonal form:

g1(x)f (x)g(x) = diag((x)) .

(2)

such gauge xing is not complete as it leaves a u(1)n gauge invariance,
and is aected by gribov ambiguities because at each point x there are in
general n! dierent gauge-xed forms of f , related to each other by arbitrary
permutations of the eigenvalues:

q1i(x)q = q(i)(x) .

(3)

as a consequence of the gribov ambiguity it is not possible in general to
put f in diagonal form globally, namely on the whole m without discon-
tinuities. in fact if we map m into a polygon with pairs of edges suitably
identied, and x the unitary gauge on the polygon (this is always possible
as the bundle is trivial on a disc), after gauge xing the eigenvalues of f will
in general appear in a dierent order on the edges that are to be identied.
more precisely: consider a point x on m, and let 1(x|m) be the homo-
topy group on m with base point x. let us order the eigenvalues of f in x
in an arbitrary way, for instance

1(x) > 2(x) > .... > n (x) .

(4)

this will be referred to in the rest of the paper as the standard order. con-
sider now a non trivial element x of 1(x|m), that is a homotopically non-
trivial loop starting from x. as we go round the loop the eigenvalues of f
are subjected to a permutation, or, for a generic gauge group, they are acted
upon by an element of the weyl group. this denes a homomorphism that
associates to each element x of the homotopy group 1(x|m) an element
p (x) of the weyl group.
the permutation p (x) depends on the choice of the base point x accord-

ing to the formula

p (y) = p (1

yx)p (x)p (yx) ,

(5)

where y is a closed loop starting in y and dened by y = 1
yxxyx where
yx is an arbitrarily chosen path from y to x. p (yx) is the permutation
of the eigenvalues in x with respect to the standard order dened above
obtained by starting with the eigenvalues in the standard order in y and
moving to x along the chosen path yx. eq. (5) shows that changing the

3

base point of the homotopy group, namely deforming the original path x
into y, corresponds to a conjugacy transformation on p (x).

according to this analysis the functional integral over the eld congura-
tions of f splits into several topological sectors, one for each homomorphism
of 1(x|m) into sn .
it is easy to see that in the case of u(n), where the eigenvalues of f
are real and the weyl group is the symmetric group sn , the homomorphic
maps of 1(x|m) into sn are in one-to-one correspondence with the n-
coverings of m without foldings or branch points. in this correspondence
each eigenvalue of f is associated to one sheet of the n-covering. such
coverings are not in general connected but consist of a certain number of
connected parts. the decomposition of a covering into its connected parts
coincides with the decomposition of the representations of 1(x|m) into its
irreducible subspaces. a connected part that covers m k times consists of a
k-dimensional subspace of the n-dimensional space of the eigenvalues of f .
this subspace is invariant under the action of 1(x|m) and does not contain
any lower dimensional invariant subspace.
each connected part can be thought of as the world-sheet of a two-
dimensional string that covers k times the target space and that can be
described as follows. let us denote by  ( = 1, 2) a set of coordinates pa-
rameterizing the world-sheet. each point x of the target space has k images
on the world-sheet labeled by ,i(x) with i = 1, 2, . . . , k. so we can associate
to each point of the world-sheet a single eigenvalue () by requiring

(i(x)) = i(x) .

(6)

in the end we have a single eigenvalue and a u(1) gauge invariance associated
to each connected part of the covering, namely to each irreducible part of
the representation of 1(x|m) in terms of elements of sn .
we may be tempted to conclude that, through the mechanism outlined
above, a non abelian gauge theory in two dimensions can be described in
terms of a string theory with an abelian gauge theory on its world-sheet.
however this is true only if the abelianization is not spoiled by other terms
in the action that induce a coupling between dierent sheets of the covering.
therefore we have to require that, at least in some limit for the coupling
constants, the strings described above are free or weakly coupled.

in this respect a problem arises directly from the gauge xing procedure.
indeed, the faddeev-popov determinant for our gauge choice induces a strong

4

interaction between dierent sheets of the covering. in fact, the functional
integration measure produces, as usual, a squared vandermonde determinant
of the eigenvalues of f :

2z dxi>j

()2 = d(x) exp

df (x) = d(x)yx
(7)
where d = d2xg is the area element. this term is singular when two
eigenvalues coincide and indeed it describes an interaction of dierent world-
sheets (i.e. eigenvalues) at the same target space point x. therefore we must
require that the vandermonde determinants arising from the gauge xing are
exactly canceled for the string picture outlined above to make sense.

log |i(x)  j(x)|

,

this is obtained in matrix string theories (dvv) [9, 10] by use of super-
symmetry. in the limit of vanishing string coupling, the adjoint scalars xm
and fermions  of the theory commute with each other and it is possible
to choose a gauge in which they are all diagonal. however no vandermonde
determinant arises from the faddeev-popov procedure because contributions
from xm and  cancel exactly.

in [7, 8] we showed that the same cancellation of vandermonde deter-
minants occurs in pure two-dimensional yang-mills theory on a torus or a
cylinder if the gauge where the eld strength f is diagonal is chosen. the
ensuing theory has matrix string states, just as the dvv model, and its par-
tition function is closely related to the one of the dvv model itself [12, 13].
in this paper we show that the results of [7, 8] can be extended to include
riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus and arbitrary number of borders, if one
considers a particular generalized yang-mills theory (in the sense of [14, 15])
which has the property to coincide with ordinary ym2 on at surfaces. for
the generalized theory it is shown that the cancellation of the vandermonde
determinants occurs also on arbitrary riemann surfaces and that the theory
is consistently described by a string theory with a u(1) gauge symmetry on
its world-sheet2.

2also in the case of matrix string theory there is a remaining u(1) gauge symmetry on

the world-sheet whose role was emphasized in [17].

3 generalized yang-mills theory in the uni-

tary gauge

we begin by considering the partition function of a generalized ym2 on an
arbitrary riemann surface [4, 14, 15]. we shall then proceed to x the gauge
in which f is diagonal by following essentially ref. [11], where the partition
function for ordinary ym2 was calculated in the same gauge. the partition
function is given by

z(m) =z dadf exp(cid:26)zm

d v (f ) + i trzm
where d is the volume form on m and f (a) is given by

f (a)f(cid:27) ,

f (a) = da  ia  a .

(8)

(9)

in eqs. (8) and (9) f is a n  n hermitian matrix and a is a one-form
on m with values in the space of hermitian matrices. v (f ) denotes an
arbitrary gauge invariant potential, namely a potential that depends only
on the eigenvalues of f , with in principle an arbitrary dependence from the
two-dimensional metric of the surface. in order to reproduce ordinary ym2
it is enough to choose

v (f ) =

trf 2

(10)

g2
ym
2

and perform the quadratic functional integral in f .

our gauge choice consists in conjugating the n  n hermitian matrix f
into a diagonal form, namely into its cartan sub-algebra. as discussed in the
previous section, this can always be done locally, according to eq. (2). the
gauge xed action, including the appropriate faddeev-popov ghost term, can
be written as the sum of two terms:

sbrst(m, t) = scartan + sodiag ,

(11)

where scartan involves the diagonal part of a and exhibits the residual u(1)n
gauge invariance:

scartan =zm"v ()d 

iida(i)# ,

nxi=1

(12)

6

where a(i) is the i-th diagonal term of the matrix form a. the faddeev-
popov ghost term and the o-diagonal part of a are contained in sodiag
which can be cast into the following form:

sodiag =zm

dxi>j

(i  j)(cid:20)1

2

ab aij

a

aji

b + i(cijcji + cijcji)(cid:21) ,

(13)

where aij

a is given by

(14)
and e
a denotes the inverse of the two-dimensional vierbein. the elds cji
and cij are respectively the ghost and anti-ghost elds associated to the gauge
condition f ij = 0.

a = e

a aij



aij

the action (13) contains the same number of fermionic and bosonic de-
grees of freedom and it is invariant, for each value of the composite index
[ij], with respect to a set of symmetry transformation with grassmann-odd
parameters which are reported in [7]. one would expect, as a result of these
supersymmetries, a complete cancellation of the bosonic and fermionic con-
tributions in the partition function. however this supersymmetry is broken
on a generic riemann surface by the measure of the functional integral. the
reason is that the supersymmetric partners of the ghost and anti-ghost elds
are the zero-forms aij
a , which are the components of the one-form a in the
base of the vierbein (14). so if the measure of the functional integral con-
tains the one-form aij, namely is daij
 dcijdcij, there is a mismatch in the
number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom as on a curved surface
the number of zero-forms and one-forms does not coincide. this results
into an anomaly that was explicitly calculated in [11]:

(15)

after integration over the non-cartan elds, the theory becomes purely
abelian with a u(1)n gauge symmetry. taking into account (15), it is de-
scribed by the eective action

the anomaly term at the r.h.s. of (17) is divergent when two eigenvalues
coincide and requires some regularization procedure. in [11], the calculation
of the functional integral for the u(1)n theory was done and it turned out to
be equivalent to replacing each eigenvalue i(x) with an arbitrary constant
integer value: i(x)  ni, where ni is the ux of the abelian eld strength.
in this way the anomaly term correctly reproduces the dependence of the
standard partition function [2, 3, 5] from the genus g of m, namely the
factor qi>j(ni  nj)22g. however while in other gauges [5] and in the lat-
tice formulation the integers ni, being labels of irreducible representations of
u(n), satisfy the condition n1 > n2 > n3 > ... > nn , in the unitary gauge
nothing seems to forbid the existence of non regular terms3, namely of
terms with at least two such integers coinciding.

non regular terms, which are divergent for g > 1, were eliminated by
a rather ad hoc regularization procedure in [11], leaving the problem of a
completely consistent derivation of the standard partition function of ym2
in the unitary gauge still open.
it should be noticed that all non trivial
maps 1(x|m)  sn lead to sectors made entirely by non regular terms;
in fact in a non trivial sector at least two eigenvalues must belong to the
same connected world-sheet and, being constant, have to coincide. so any
regularization scheme that sets to zero the non regular terms also disregards
all sectors corresponding to non trivial maps 1(x|m)  sn .
as already pointed out in [7], non regular terms are nite in the case of
the torus (g = 1), and for any surface with zero curvature the anomaly term
at the r.h.s. of eq. (17) vanishes. in this case no regularization is needed and
there is no reason to neglect the non trivial maps in 1(x|m)  sn , which
for g = 1 are labeled by pairs (q1, q2) of commuting permutations. the
calculation was done by the authors of [7], initially with the hope that the
sum over the non trivial maps would just amount to cancel the non regular
terms. surprisingly this happens only if the sum is restricted to the subset of
sectors with say q2 = 1, while the entire sum leads to a partition function [7]
that has a wider spectrum than the standard one, and which is closely related
to the partition function of the dvv string matrix model [12, 13].

higher genus surfaces and coupling to gravity in this paper we take a
stronger point of view and argue that non-trivial sectors can be consistently
kept also on space-times m of genus g > 1. our point of view can be

3we follow the terminology of ref. [11]

8

summarized as follows:

1. quantization in the unitary gauge beyond the g = 1 case would ask
for a consistent regularization scheme (yet to be found) to cancel the
logarithmic singularities in the anomaly term at the r.h.s. of eq. (17).
we propose instead to achieve the same result by modifying the po-
tential v () to include in it a term that cancels exactly the divergent
anomaly term so that the eective potential v () is regular and of the
form

with

v () =

v() =

nxi=1
xk=1

v(i) ,

tkk .

(18)

(19)

in this way we dene a generalized ym2 theory whose action reduces
to the one of standard ym2 in the limit of zero curvature and with
a potential v() = g2
2 2. in other words: we consider a generalized
ym2 theory which is the ordinary ym2 with a non standard coupling
to gravity.

ym

2. it is possible, in our opinion, that the one presented above is the only
consistent way to quantize ym2 in the unitary gauge. if that is the
case the unitary gauge is not a mere gauge choice, but it denes an
entirely new theory. some possible reasons for it are discussed below.

a rather than aij

the redenition of the potential exactly corresponds to the cancellation of
the anomaly. so it is natural to ask:
is it possible to dene the theory
from the beginning in such a way that the fermionic symmetry of (13) is
not broken by the integration measure? the obvious answer is to use the
zero-forms aij
 as the independent degrees of freedom in the
functional integration measure, which becomes d aij
a dcijdcij. this amounts
to consider the gauge elds as dened in the tangent space, like spinors,
when space-time is curved.
(14) is locally
invertible this results into a dierent counting of degrees of freedom. this
is apparent in a lattice formulation. consider a discretized manifold made
of squares with sides all of the same length. the ghost and anti-ghost elds
sit on the sites of the lattice and the gauge elds on the links. on a site j
where the coordination number cj is 4 (zero curvature) the gauge degrees of

in spite of the fact that eq.

9

freedom match exactly the number of degrees of freedom of the ghost anti-
ghost system, otherwise the mismatch is proportional to cj  4, namely to
the curvature. this argument provides a lattice based derivation of eq. (15).
with the gauge elds dened on the tangent space, instead, the degrees of
freedom at each site coincide with the one in at space irrespective of the
curvature and no anomaly arises.

we do not know yet how to formulate on a lattice (for instance in the
framework of regge calculus) the coupling to gravity of gauge elds associ-
ated to the tangent space. on the other hand, there are indications that
ordinary lattice gauge theory might be inadequate in curved space-time.
consider for instance the standard wilson action: the plaquette variable upl
carries no information about the metric and hence its continuum limit can
only depend on quantities that can be written as dierential forms, namely

upl  1 + fdxdx .

(20)
however the lagrangian density ffggg has a non trivial depen-
dence on the metric and it can be written in the language of dierential
forms only by using the hodge dual operator. therefore the coupling of
gauge theories to gravity on a lattice seems to require, instead of the tradi-
tional wilson action, a rst order formalism4 (see for instance [18]) where the
plaquette variable is coupled with an auxiliary eld which in generic space-
time dimensions is an antisymmetric tensor fab, that is a two-form, in the
tangent space indices.

eective action with the eective potential v () given by eqs. (18) and
(19) the action (16) reduces to the sum of n decoupled u(1) theories, namely

sef f =

nxi=1z (cid:16)v(i)  iida(i)(cid:17) .

(21)

in the functional integral, however, one has to sum over all sectors corre-
sponding to the homomorphisms 1(x|m)  sn , as discussed in the previ-
ous section. so in a non trivial sector the u(1) theories in (21) are coupled
by the boundary conditions:

 : i(x)  p(i)(x) ,

(22)

4the two-dimensional case is an exception from this point of view:

in this case the
action depends on the metric only through the area, and the wilson action can be used
provided the correct volume element is used

10

where  is an element of 1(x|m) and p the corresponding element of sn
in the homomorphism. as a result, rather than n decoupled u(1) theories,
we have a u(1) theory on each connected part of the world-sheet, whose area
is an integer multiple k of the area a of the target space. to each connected
world-sheet is associated a u(1) partition function, given by:

zu(1)(ka) =

+xn=

ekav(n) ,

(23)

where v(n) is given by eq. (19). given a covering of m with sk (pk ksk = n)
connected parts of area ka, its contribution to the partition function is then
given by

z{sk} =

yk=1hzu(1)(ka)isk .

(24)

the total partition function is then obtained by summing (24) over all cov-
erings.

if the surface m has boundaries, the states on the a-th boundary a
are characterized by the conjugacy class of p (a), namely by the lengths of
the cycles of p (a), and by the u(1) holonomies for each cycle of p (a).
if  is the sum of the u(1) holonomies of all cycles on a given connected
world-sheet, the u(1) partition function (23) is replaced by the kernel:

ku(1)(ka, ) =

+xn=

ekav(n)+in.

(25)

the kernel associated to a surface with an arbitrary number of boundaries is
obtained by summing over all coverings with the prescribed conjugacy classes
of sn on the boundaries, each covering being weighted with the product of
the u(1) kernel functions (25) associated to its connected parts.

in conclusion, after integration on the non-cartan degrees of freedom,
the resulting eective theory is a string theory (theory of coverings without
branch points) with a u(1) gauge theory on the world-sheet.
in the next
section we shall show that this can be described as a lattice gauge theory,
with a gauge group gn which is the semi-direct product of sn and u(1)n .

4

lattice formulation of the eective theory

let us consider a surface m with the topology of a disc. since the homotopy
group of the disc is trivial, only the identical permutation can be associated

11

to the boundary of the disc and the only covering consists of n disconnected
copies of the disc. according to the previous discussion the kernel on a disc
is then given by

k ((p, ),a) = (p )xni

exp( nxi=1

(inii  av(ni))) ,

(26)

where a is the area of the disc and i the invariant angles of the u(1)
holonomies. the kernel is vanishing for any permutation p other than the
identity. consider now the group gn dened as the subgroup of u(n) given
by the matrices of the form

(p, ) = diag(cid:16)ei1, . . . , ein(cid:17) p ,

where k are real and p is a permutation matrix:

pij = ip (j) .

(27)

(28)

note that with this denition we have (p q)ij = i p q(j), while on a n-
vector  we have (p )i = p 1(i). the product in gn is the ordinary matrix
product: in the notation of eq. (27) the group product reads

(p, ) (q, ) = (p q,  + p ) ,

(29)

where it is clear that gn can be viewed as a semi-direct product of sn and
u(1)n . the inverse of a group element is given by

(p, )1 = (p 1,p 1) .

(30)

the kernel on a disc k ((p, ),a) is invariant under gauge transformations
of gn . in fact from

(q, )(p, )(q, )1 = (qp q1,  + q  qp q1)

it follows almost immediately that

k(cid:16)(q, )(p, )(q, )1,a(cid:17) = k ((p, ),a) .

(31)

(32)

this property will enable us to formulate the theory described in the previous
section as a gauge theory of gn on a lattice. in fact suppose to draw on the
target space m a lattice and to associate to each link  an element (p, )

12

of gn . the product of all the elements of gn along a plaquette denes the
plaquette variable (ppl, pl) and the partition function is dened as

zlatt =y xp z 2

0

dypl

k ((ppl, pl),apl) .

(33)

as in the case of the heat-kernel action for a u(n) gauge theory, the boltz-
mann weight for a single plaquette is left invariant in form if one sews two
plaquettes together by integrating over their common link. in fact a straight-
forward calculation gives:

di
2

xqsnz yi
= k ((p1, 1)(p2, 2),a1 + a2) .

k ((p1, 1)(q, ),a1) k(cid:16)(q, )1(p2, 2),a2(cid:17)

(34)

this property insures that the result obtained on a lattice is valid also in
the continuum limit. on the other hand, it also allows to solve exactly the
theory by reducing the surface to a single plaquette with suitably identied
links. again this is in complete analogy with the solution of ym2 obtained
in [2]. let us consider rst the case of the torus, namely of a square with
identied opposite sides. the partition function is given by:

didi

didi

42

42 k(cid:16)(p, )(q, )(p, )1(q, )1,a(cid:17)

zn (a) = xp,qsnz yi
= xp,qsnz yi
k(cid:16)(cid:16)p qp 1q1,  + p   p qp 1  p qp 1q1(cid:17) ,a(cid:17)
(p qp 1q1)z yi
= xp,qsn
exp(xi
x{ni}

(ini [i + (p )i  (q)i  i)]  av(ni))) . (35)

didi

42

therefore the partition function is expressed as a sum over pairs of commut-
ing permutations, that is over unbranched n-coverings of the torus. the
integration over  and  produces respectively a factor ni np 1i
.
and ni nq1i
the result of the integration is to equate all the nis belonging to a given
connected component of the covering dened by (p, q). a u(1) partition

area ka, which is a torus with area ka. this result is in complete agreement
both with the prescription given at the end of the previous section and with
the results of [7].

these results can easily be generalized to a surface of arbitrary genus and
an arbitrary number of boundaries. in fig. 1 a surface of genus g with p
boundaries is represented as a single plaquette with suitably identied edges.

r.h.s. of (41) depends only on the conjugacy classes of (sa, a), namely on
the cycle decomposition of sa and, for each cycle c of sa, on the quanti-
ties c
transformations but it can be seen explicitly from (41) by noticing that sa
appears only in the expression rasar1
a (with a sum over ra), and that all

while d(n) ensures that each connected world-sheet contributes with a factor
a = pic a,i. this is a consequence of gauge invariance under gn
a,i with i  c are coupled to the same integer n due to the eect of d(n).

finally it should be remarked that the kernel (41) is completely consistent in
the sense that it is reproduced by sewing two surfaces together according to
the standard procedure, namely by identifying the conjugacy classes of the
boundaries to be sewn and by integrating over the group.

5 partition function on arbitrary genus

in order to write an explicit expression for the partition function (or kernel)
given in (41), we have to use techniques developed by several authors [6, 16]
that allow to write the number of coverings on a given surface in terms of the
characters of sn . in this section we will restrict the discussion to the case
of surfaces without boundaries, while in the next section the general case of
surfaces with boundaries will be discussed. we can proceed in four steps:

1. write the partition function that describes the statistics of the coverings

without branch points on a surface of genus g, that is

z (cov)(g, q) =

z (cov)

k

(g)qk ,

xk=1

(42)

where z (cov)
was studied in [6, 16] and it will be given below.

(g) is the number of k-coverings. this partition function

k

2. write the partition function f (cov)(g, q) that describes the statistics
of connected coverings. this is obtained by taking the logarithm of
z (cov)(g, q):

f (cov)(g, q) = log z (cov)(g, q) =

f (cov)

k

(g)qk .

(43)

xk=1

16

3. associate to each connected covering the u(1) partition function (23):

f (a, g, q) =

f (cov)

k

(g)

xk=1

+xn=

ekav(n)qk =

+xn=

f (cov)(g, eav(n)q)

(44)

4. the exponential5 of f (a, g, q) is then the generating function (i.e.
grand-canonical partition function) for the partition functions given in
(41) with no boundaries (p = 0):

z(a, g, q) = ef (a,g,q) =

xn =1

zn (a, g)qn =

+yn=

z (cov)(g, eav(n)q) .

(45)

all we need to know, in order to write z(ag, q), is the explicit expression
of z (cov)(g, q), that was given in [6, 16] as a sum over irreducible represen-
tations of sn as n  :

q|h| ,

(46)

(47)

.

the integers hi are subjected to the constraint h1 > h2 > ..... > hn  0 and
are related to the lengths m1, m2, ..., mn of the rows of the corresponding
young tableau by hi = n  i + mi. the quantity |h| =pi mi is the number

of boxes in the young tableau.

the integer n in eq. (46) is just the order of the matrices in the complex
matrix model introduced in ref. [16], and whose solution is given by eq. (46).

5in [7] for the case g = 1 both signs in ef (g,q) were considered, the minus sign
corresponding to a fermionic model. in the general case g > 1 this choice seems to be

preserve this property.

figure 2: ground state and lowest-lying excited states in the fermionic de-
scription of the representations of sn , together with the corresponding young
tableaux.

no such quantity is present in the original problem of counting coverings, so
there must be no dependence on n at the end. the factor n |h|(2g2) = n 2g2
just counts the genus g of the world-sheet and it will be dropped in what
follows. all the other quantities in (46) depend only on the young tableau
and not on the order n of the symmetric group. however the limit n 
 has to be taken in order to take into account young tableaux with an
arbitrarily large number of rows.
in order to make this more explicit and also to simplify the expression of
(46) we introduce a notation where each young tableau is associated to an
excited state of a gas of fermions whose energy levels are the relative integers
(see [19] for an analogous notation in the case of u(n)). the ground state
(|h| = 0) and the lowest excited states are shown in fig. 2; they are in
one-to-one correspondence with the young tableaux. the correspondence is
as follows: let the innite sequence of relative integers h1 > h2 > h3 > .........
represent the occupied levels and the complementary sequence k1 < k2 <
k3 < ....... the empty levels. by denition {hi}{kj} = z and {hi}{kj} = .
the position of the origin is irrelevant, so the sequences {hi} and {kj} are
dened modulo an integer shift. the length mi of the i-th row of the young

18

tableau is given by the number of empty levels below hi:

mi = #kj : kj < hi

(49)

and similarly the length rj of the j-th column by the number of the occupied
levels above kj:

(50)
the total number of boxes is the number of pairs {kj, hi} for which hi > kj:
(51)

rj = #hi : kj < hi .

|h| = #{kj, hi} : kj < hi .

this coincides with the number of moves required to reach the excited state
under consideration from the ground state, a move being dened as a jump
of a fermion one level up to occupy an empty level. the young tableaux
with given |h| label the irreducible representations of s|h|, and the factor
(h) given in eq. (48) is related to the dimension d{h} of the corresponding
representation by:

(h) = |h|!
d{h}

.

(52)

a simple calculation shows that (h) can be rewritten asq{hi>kj}(hikj).the

partition function of the coverings can then be written without any reference
to n as:

z (cov)(g, q) = xh1>h2>....

2g2

 y{hi>kj}

(hi  kj)

q|h| =x{h}"d{h}

|h|!#22g

q|h| .

(53)
the coecients of the expansion of z (cov)(g, q) can be easily calculated from
(53), and the rst few of them are reproduced in the appendix. the grand-
canonical partition function z(a, g, q) can be obtained in principle by in-
serting (53) into (45) and the rst few coecient of the expansion are also
given in the appendix. except for g = 0 and g = 1 no compact expression
for z (cov)(g, q) or z(a, g, q) is available.

for g = 0 we have z (cov)(g = 0, q) = eq and the u(n) partition function

(54)

this means that for the topology of the sphere our theory reduces to n copies
of the corresponding abelian theory.

as already discussed in [8], z (cov)(g, q) can be written for g = 1 as an

innite product, and z(a, g = 1, q) is given by:

6 surfaces with boundaries

consider a surface mg,p of genus g and with p boundaries. as discussed
in the previous section, the original u(n) gauge theory is described by the
n-coverings of mg,p with a residual u(1) gauge theory on each world-sheet.
the states at the a-th boundary are then characterized by :

1. the conjugacy class of p (a), where a is any closed path that can be
deformed into the boundary (see section 2). each conjugacy class is
given in terms of the length of the cycles of p (a), namely of the set
of integers {r(a)

l=1 lr(a)

l = n.

2. the u(1) holonomy associated to each boundary of any world-sheet,
that is to each cycle of p (a). the holonomy is given by an invariant
angle (a)
enumerates the cycles of the
same length. since the cycles of same length are indistinguishable, we
expect the wave function to be symmetric in the corresponding angles.

let us rst consider the case where no u(1) gauge theory is present,
namely the pure theory of coverings. the grand-canonical partition function
that describes the statistics of the coverings on a surface with p boundaries
and genus g is dened by

in the rusakov partition function of ym2.

by the number r(a)

n,l(cid:17) is determined by the following considera-

(62)

ku(1)(ka, ) =

+xn=

ekav(n)+in

(63)

is associated to each connected part of the world-sheet. here k is the degree
of the covering and  is the sum over all the invariant u(1) angles associated
to the cycles of the world-sheets boundaries. it is clear then that, due to the
angular integrations in eq. (59), all cycles belonging to the same connected
covering have the same momentum n irrespective of the boundary on which
they are situated. moreover, the total length |r|n of the cycles with a given
momentum n is the same for all boundaries of mg,p:

starting from eq.

(66) one can obtain the result, already known fron
the lattice formulation os section 4, that by sewing together two surfaces we
obtain a kernel described again by eq. (66) for the resulting surface. this
follows from the fact that same property holds for the partition function of

the u(1) invariant angles on the two sides have to be identied in pairs (for
cycles of the same length!) and integrated over. this gives a delta function of
the corresponding momenta, so that for each subspace of given momentum n
the sewing and cutting is unaected by the other subspaces and its statistics
coincides with the one of the pure covering theory.

7 conclusions and further developments

the quantization of ym2 in the unitary gauge on an arbitrary riemann
surface has led us to consider a dierent model, a generalized ym2 theory
whose eective theory, after integration over the non-cartan component of
the gauge elds, is described by a string with a u(1) gauge group on the
world-sheet. this theory coincides with a gauge theory on a lattice with
gauge group gn , the semi-direct product of the symmetric group sn and
u(1)n . it may be surprising that the partition function on an arbitrary genus
surface of our original u(n) gauge theory can be calculated exactly within the
gauge theory of a group gn which is a subgroup of the original gauge group.
however there are correlators of the original u(n) gauge theory that cannot
be calculated in the framework of the eective theory. consider for instance
correlators of wilson loops, which depend on the non-cartan components
of the u(n) gauge elds.
if the wilson loops are non intersecting, such
components are irrelevant as the quadratic term in the o-diagonal action
(13) depends at each space-time point on both space-time components of
aij
a . for intersecting wilson loops instead this term produces an interaction
between dierent sheets of the covering whose eect cannot be described in
terms of the pure gn theory. the situation is somewhat similar to the one in
multi-matrix models, where the angular degrees of freedom can be integrated
out in the calculation of the partition function and of certain correlators but
are involved in a non trivial way in the most general correlators.

besides its relation with ym2, the gn gauge theory is interesting by itself,
and it can generalized in two dierent directions that we shall briey mention
here, while leaving the details for a future publication [21].

the rst type of extension is the one already considered in [16] for the
theory of coverings.
it consists in allowing coverings with branch points,
namely in allowing the strings to split and join. in the framework of matrix
string theory this was discussed in [20, 17]. a branch point can be described
as a boundary where all the u(1) invariant angles are set to zero. in this case,
if the permutation associated to the boundary is trivial this just becomes an
ordinary point, otherwise it becomes a point where a more or less complicated
interaction amongst the sheets of the covering occurs. the simplest case
consists in a single string splitting into two strings or vice-versa, and it is
described by a permutation with only one non trivial cycle of order 2. from
this point of view the results of section 6 are all we need to introduce branch
points in our theory. however we want to consider, as in [16], the limit where
a continuum distribution of branch points is introduced. for the theory
of pure coverings, that is for the gauge theory of sn , this corresponds to
replacing the plaquette action, which for the unbranched theory of coverings
is just a delta function, with a sum over irreducible representations of sn :

(p ) =xr

drr(p ) xr

drr(p )ecr .

(67)

here p is the permutation associated to the plaquette and cr is any quantity
that depends only on the representation r and that contains all the infor-
mation about the couplings of the dierent types of branch points (see [16]
for details).

in our gn gauge theory the introduction of a continuum of branch points
will amount to replacing the plaquette action (26) with a generic expansion
in the characters of the irreducible representations of gn . the weight of each
representation should contain the area a of the plaquette at the exponent,
to insure good gluing properties as in (34), and will depend both on the
potential v(n) that appears in the original action and on the couplings of the
dierent types of branch points encoded in cr. these couplings are new free
parameters of the theory which are not present in the original lagrangian. as
they describe interactions amongst dierent sheets, they would presumably
correspond to singular terms in the u(1)n gauge theory obtained after xing
the unitary gauge, possibly of the same type as the ones that have been
eliminated by the redenition of the potential. a dierent type of extension
is obtained by considering a more general gauge group gl,m , dened as the
semi-direct product of sl and u(m)l. the product law in gl,m is explicitly

24

given by

(p, gi)(q, hi) = (p q, gihp 1(i)) ,

(68)

where p and q are elements of sl, gi and hi (i = 1, 2, ..., l) are elements of
u(m) and the products at the r.h.s. of (68) are accordingly group products
in sl and u(m). the gauge theory based on this group describes a theory
of coverings (with possibility of introducing branch points as above) with a
u(m) on each world-sheet. this theory would include both the standard
ym2 and the gn theory described in this paper as particular cases. its pla-
quette action (without branch points) can be easily constructed by following
the same line of reasoning used to obtain eq. (26), and it reads

k ((p, gi),a) = (p )

lyi=1xr(i)

dr(i)r(i) (gi)eac

r(i) ,

(69)

where r(i) are the representations of the i-th group u(m) and are labeled
by a set of m integers {n(i)}. the whole theory can now be constructed
by sewing plaquettes together and it is essentially obtained by replacing in
the formulas of section 4 the integer momentum n with the representations
of u(m) and the plane wave function ein with the characters r(i)(g). by
allowing branch points in the string theories based on gl,m we can construct a
large class of string theories, that range from the pure u(m) theory (standard
ym2 theory) at one end to the pure theory of coverings at the other end.
the well known result of gross and taylor [6], namely that in the large n
ym2 is equivalent to a theory of coverings with a set of allowed interactions,
suggests that the same kind of dual description may be possible also for the
more general theories we have discussed.

appendix

in this appendix we display explicitly the coecients of the grand-canonical
partition functions for the coverings and the generalized yang-mills theory
up to order q5.

let us consider rst z (cov)(g, q) dened in eq.

(42). each coecient
(g) is the number of inequivalent unbranched k-coverings of a genus

z (cov)

k

25

g surface without boundaries. two coverings are said to be inequivalent if
they cannot be obtained from each other by simple relabeling of the sheets;
therefore the total number of k-coverings is k!z (cov)

(g).

naming  = 2  2g the euler characteristic of the surface m, from eq.

the number of inequivalent connected coverings are given by the coecients

by inserting eqs. (70) and (71) into eqs. (44) and (45) we can write the
rst few terms in the expansion of z(g,a, q), namely the partition functions
zn (a, g) for n up to 5:
z0(a, g) = 1 ,
z1(a, g) = z(a) ,
