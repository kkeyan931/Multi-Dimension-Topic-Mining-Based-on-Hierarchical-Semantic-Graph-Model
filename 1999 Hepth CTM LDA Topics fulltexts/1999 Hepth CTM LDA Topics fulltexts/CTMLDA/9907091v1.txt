abstract:

three dimensional (abelian) gauged massive thirring model is bosonized in the large fermion
mass limit. a further integration of the gauge eld results in a non-local theory. a truncated
version of that is the maxwell chern simons (mcs) theory with a conventional mass term
or mcs proca theory. this gauge invariant theory is completely solved in the hamiltonian
and lagrangian formalism, with the spectra of the modes determined. since the vector eld
constituting the model is identied (via bosonization) to the fermion current, the charge current
algebra, including the schwinger term is also computed in the mcs proca model.

i. introduction

it has been appreciated for quite sometime, that gauge symmetry in 2+1-dimensions is
subtle, mainly due the chern simons term [1]. self dual theory with the (non-topological)
mass term is gauge invariant, being dual to the maxwell chern simons (mcs) gauge theory.
chern simons term is referred to as the topological mass term. a master lagrangian has been
constructed [2] which can generate both the above mentioned models.

including a non-topological mass term in the mcs model leads to the so called mcs proca
(mcsp) model [3]. this term does not break the gauge invariance since one can view the
mcsp theory as a combination of self dual and maxwell theory. the former is equivalent to a
gauge theory and the latter is manifestly a gauge theory. a lagrangian analysis was given in [3]
where the spectra of two massive modes were provided. in this paper, a detailed hamiltonian
constraint analysis [4] is provided for the rst time. it is shown that an involved analysis leads
to identical spectra and equations of motion obtained via lagrangian method. this is one of
our main results. but there are additional benits of dirac analysis, which we elaborate below.
let us now put the mcsp model, studied here, in its proper perspective. our motivation
in the above model is that it has been derived from a three dimensional u(1) gauged massive
thirring model [5] via bosonization of the fermion modes, (in the large fermion mass limit)
[1, 6]. the bosonic theory is a master lagrangian, comprising of the u(1) gauge eld a, and
an auxiliary eld b, introduced to linearise the thirring self interaction term.
integrating
over b leads to a generalized mcs model, which under certain approximations sheds light
on the self interaction eects on inter-quark potential [7]. on the other hand, integration
of the gauge eld a (in lorentz gauge) yields a generalization of the mcsp model in b. a
truncated version of it is the mcsp model in question. the added bonus of this scheme is that
b reects the behaviour of the fermion current j =  since j  b/g, g denoting the
thirring coupling. indeed, we have correctly reproduced the current conservation and current
algebra including the schwinger term. more complicated fermionic composite objects can also
be studied. this is the other important result of this paper.

the paper is organised as follows: section ii briey gives the bosonization results of gauged
thirring model. section iii deals with the lagrangian formulation, in a way similar to [3]. the
particle spectra is obtained. section iv is the main body of our work, consisting of the full
hamiltonian analysis and current algebra results. the paper ends with a brief conclusion in
section v.

ii. bosonization of gauged thirring model

the u(1) gauged thirring model lagrangian is,

lf = i(  iea)  m  +

(1)

here a = a  a and conventionally one takes p = 1/e2, q = /(2e2). the reason we
have considered them arbitrary will become clear as we proceed. the above model is linearised

where c = b + ea,  = 1/(8) and a = 1/(6m). the u(1) gauge invariance present in
(1) is clearly visible as regards the a eld. the a (gauge) and b (matter) eld equations
are,

 c + epa +

a = 0.

the above two equations are combined to give

notice that without the gauge eld kinetic terms in the parent fermion model, we would have
obtained simply b = 0.

the lagrangian in (3) is our master lagrangian [5]. upon selective integration of one
of the interacting elds in turn, dierent equivalent (dual) theories as reproduced which are
apparantly distinct. in this way, it is possible to connect dierent well known theories. the
duality between them appears in the form of particle spectrum, symmetry, greens function
e.t.c.. the next task is to integrate out the gauge eld.

iii. particle spectrum: lagrangian framework

modulo total derivative terms, a integration in lorentz gauge gives [5],

lb(b) = b

ap(a+p)

2(p2 + q2a)

(7)

the equation of motion for b is

ap(a+p)

2 + q( + q)

2 )22 + (q + )2

( p+a

b.

(8)

clearly b obeys the current conservation, (b = 0), as is required of the fermion current.
dening the dual of b as

b =

b,

1
2

we obtain two equations and the lagrangian in (3) in compact notation as,

a(b)  d2b = 0, a(b) + d(b) = 0,

lb(b) = bab + bdb.

the non-local operators are,

ap(a+p)

a

d  2

2 + q( + q)

2 )22 + (q + )2

( p+a

.

combining the above equations in (9), we get

(a2 + d22)b = 0.

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

unfortunately the complicated nature of the operators prohibit further study of the eld equa-
tion. let us now consider the approximations we mentioned before.

keeping within the approximations involved in the bosonization scheme itself we drop o(a2)
terms. however, with a nonvanishing p, (that is in presence of the maxwell term in (1)), the
non-local nature of the eective theory persists. in the present case we avoid this problem by
putting p = 0 and keep only the chern simons term in (1). the operators now become,

a  (

q2a

2(q + )2 2 

1
2g

), d 

2q
q + 

.

hence the b equation reduces to

[(

q2a

2(q + )2 2 

1
2g

)2 + (

2q
q + 

)22]b = 0.

the above equation is factorised in the following form [3],

(2 + m 2

+)(2 + m 2

)b = 0.

the two values of the eective mass parameter are

(15)

(16)

substituting the local expressions for a and d, we arrive at the mcsp model by neglecting
o(a2) terms but in the above analysis we have not dropped o(a2) terms. there is no contradic-
tion here since now we are studying the mcsp model as such, forgetting how it was originated
in the rst place. however, is we persist with a2  0 in (14), we end up with a single massive
mode,

(2 + m 2)b = 0, m 2 

(q + )2
16q22g2 (1 +

a

82g

).

this concludes the lagrangian analysis of the mcsp model.

iv. particle spectrum: hamiltonian framework

we start with the mcsp lagrangian, using (13),

l = p bb + qbb + rbb.

(17)

where,

p =

q2a

4(q + )2 , q =

2q
q + 

, r = 

1
2g

.

the conjugate momenta and the canonical hamiltonian are dened in the standard way,

 =

l
 b

, h =  b  l.

explicit expressions for the above are,

0 = 0, i = 4p (ib0  bi)  qijbj,

h = 

1
8p

( + qijbj)2 + b0(ii  qijibj)  p bijbij  rbb.

(18)

(19)

(20)

we now perform the constraint analysis by obtaining the constraints and subsequently com-
puting the dirac brackets. our aim is to obtain the equations of motion of the modes and
reproduce the spectra obtained in (16). the primary constraint is

1(x)  0(x)  0,

(21)

and time persistence generates the secondary constraint

2(x)  1(x) = [1(x),z d2yh(y)] = ii(x)  2rb0(x)  qijibj(x)  0.

(22)

these brackets are obtained by using the fundamental poisson brackets

[(x), b(y)] = g

 (x  y).

the constraints constitute a second class pair with the non-trivial algebra,

[1, 1] = [2, 2] = 0,

[1(x), 2(y)] = 2r(x  y).

(23)

5

the inverse of the constraint matrix ij, dened by r d2ycij(x, y)jk(y, z) = gik(x  z) has
the non zero element

this generates the nontrivial dirac brackets

c12(x, y) = 

1
2r

(x  y).

[b0(x), bi(y)] =

1
2r

i(x  y),

[b0(x), i(y)] = 

q
2r

ijj(x  y).

(24)

rest of the brackets are not altered. from now on we will always use these dirac brackets.
the b0  bi bracket recovers the correct schwinger term in the fermion current algebra,

[j0(x), j0(y)] = [ji(x), jj(y)] = 0,

[j0(x), ji(y)] = 

1
g

i(x  y).

(25)

after strong implementation of the constraints h in (20) simplies to

h = 

1
8p

(i + qijbj)2  p b2

ij + r(b2

0 + b2

i ).

time derivative of b0 reproduces the current conservation,

b0(x) = [b0(x), h] = ibi(x).

(26)

(27)

the above current algebra and conservation equation are two of our main results. note that
the dirac brackets are crucial in recovering them. we now rederive the particle spectrum.

first we compute the following time derivatives,

bi =

1
4p

(i + qijbj) + ib0,

i = 

q
4p

(jij + qbi)  4p jbij  qijjb0 + 2rbi.

we take time derivatives of the above equations,

bi =

1
4p

( i + qij

bj) + i

b0,

i = 

q
4p

(ji j + q bi)  4p j bij  qijj b0 + 2r bi.

a long algebra yields the following set of equations,

(28)

(29)

(30)

[2

(r

4p

(r 

)]i = 2qijj(kbk) +

)ijbj + 2qikjjbk  2qi(jkjbk).
(31)
the constraints have been used strongly. the same operator arising in left hand side of both
the above equations is used once again and we get

(2r 

[2

(r

)]2bi = 

q2
16p 3 (2r

)]bi.

(32)

the identical equation appears for i as well. this chain of derivatives diagonalizes the equa-
tions of motion. factorising (32), we obtain the identical set expressions for m given in (16).
this concludes the hamiltonian analysis.

substituting the known expressions we get the explicit forms of the masses,

m 2

expanding the square root in powers of (1/m), we get

(34)

interestingly, m+ >> m since m is independent of the fermion mass m, the large parameter.
since spin of the particles is determined by the sign of the mass [1, 3], the small value of m
can lead to a spinless particle.

v. conclusions
hamiltonian and lagrangian of the mcs proca model is performed, with the full spectra
of modes revealed. the interest in the model lies in the fact that the model has been derived
from the bosonized version of a u(1) gauged massive thirring model. since the bosonic vector
eld and the fermion current are identied, the bosonized model, and in turn the mcs proca
model, yields properties of its fermion counterpart. as a non-trivial application of the above,
we have computed correctly the fermion current algebra, with the schwinger term, staying in
the mcs proca model framework. behaviour of other fermionic composite objects, constructed
from fermion currents, can also be studied in the mcs proca model, where the quantum eects
enter via the process of bosonization.
