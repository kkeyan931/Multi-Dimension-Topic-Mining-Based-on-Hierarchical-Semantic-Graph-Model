abstract

nontrivial twisted boundary conditions associated with extra compact di-
mensions produce an ambiguity in the value of the four dimensional coupling
constants of the renormalizable interactions of the twisted elds zero modes.
resolving this indeterminancy would require a knowledge of the exact form of
the higher dimensional action including the coecients of higher dimensional
operators. for the case of moderately sized extra dimensions, the uncertainty
in the coupling constants can be of order one and may lead to modications
in the stability of the model.

theories with extra compact dimensions require that boundary conditions be specied
on the elds that depend on the bulk coordinates [1]- [6]. when viewed as an eective
four dimensional eld theory, the boundary conditions are reected via an explicit phase
dependence on the compact coordinates in the fourier expansion coecients of the elds.
when the periodic boundary conditions involve eld equality up to a global symmetry
transformation phase, the additional coordinate derivative terms associated with the com-
pact dimensions in the higher dimension lagrangian will be replaced by a corresponding
kaluza-klein mass factor in the four dimensional lagrangian, even for the zero mode elds.
indeed, by imposing periodic boundary conditions up to a r-transformation, scherk and
schwarz provided a mechanism to break supersymmetry in four dimensions through dimen-
sional compactication [7]- [9]. the purpose of this note is to point out that such nontrivial
boundary conditions also lead to an ambiguity in the value of the coupling constants for
interactions involving the zero modes of the twisted elds. the ambiguity reects the lack
of knowledge of the exact value of the coecients of the higher dimensional operators in the
higher dimensional lagrangian [10] [11]. when the compact dimensions are moderately sized
compared to the inverse uv cuto scale of the higher dimensional theory, the indeterminacy
in the coupling constant can be of order one [12] [13].

to specically display this eect, we rst consider the simplest example of a globally
u(1) invariant self interacting complex scalar eld in ve dimensions. denoting the usual
four dimensional space-time coordinates of minkowski space by x, while 0  y  2r is
the coordinate of the compact fth dimension, the action for the self-coupled complex scalar
eld, (x, y) is given by

the notation in the sum of this formula is somewhat cryptic and thus requires some further
explanation. the sum is over all possible interactions given by higher dimensional opera-
tors involving at least two derivatives. a typical term contains equal numbers of  and 
elds (consistent with the global u(1) symmetry) with a various number of ve dimensional
spacetime derivatives acting on the elds. thus, for example, (ni) is a term with ni ve
dimensional spacetime derivatives acting on . the total number of such derivatives act-
ing on all the ()  elds is (m = m1 + ... + mm) n = n1 + ... + nn. the coecients,
(5)
m1,...mm,n1,...nn, are dimensionless eld dependent couplings containing the appropriate fac-
tors of the ve dimensional metric tensor needed to make each such term in the sum a
lorentz scalar. the dependence of these higher derivative terms on the uv cuto scale, ,
of the ve dimensional theory is explicitly indicated. (recall that in ve spacetime dimen-
sions, the scalar eld has canonical mass dimension 3/2). v (5) is the scalar eld potential
describing its derivative free self-interactions. retaining the rst few higher dimensional
terms with the lowest powers of 1/, the action takes the form

for simplicity, the potential is chosen to include a quadratic mass term with mass parameter
2 and a quartic interaction with the dimensionless ve dimensional coupling constant (5).

imposing periodic boundary conditions up to an u(1) transformation on the scalar eld

so that

(x, y + 2r) = e2ia(x, y) ,

with a an arbitrary real number, it may be expanded in a fourier series as

where in the second equality the four dimensional zero mode eld, (x)  0(x), has been
explicitly singled out of the modal sum. the scalar eld eective action in four dimensions
is obtained by substituting (4) into the action (2). focusing on the pure zero mode piece of
the action, it reduces to

we see that in the eective four dimension theory of the zero modes, the eective mass
(r)2 , depend upon the
precise values of the underlying ve dimensional coupling constants. thus to match the two
theories requires a precise knowledge of higher dimensional couplings in the ve dimensional
model. furthermore, for modestly sized compact dimensions, r  110, these threshold
corrections to the four dimensional coupling constants maybe comparable in magnitude to
the original coupling constants [10]- [13].

there can be some striking implications of this observation. for instance, since the con-
tribution to the mass term proportional to the kaluza-klein mass m 2 is always positive (it
arises from a piece of the ve dimensional kinetic energy), then depending on its magnitude
relative to the mass parameter 2, its presence could alter the sign of the overall mass term
coecient and hence modify the symmetry phase. in a similar vein, the relative signs and
sizes of the coupling constants , 1 and 2 could eect the stability of the model. indeed,
in order to insure vacuum stability, they must satisfy the inequality

similar ambiguities arise in matching onto four dimensional theories containing fermions.
twisted fermion boundary conditions as well as twisted scalar boundary conditions can turn
higher dimensional operators in the ve dimensional theory into additional contributions to
the fermion mass and eective yukawa couplings involving the zero modes of the four dimen-
sional theory. consider the simple example containing a six dimensional (eight component)
ve dimensional fermion , which consists of two four dimensional (four component) dirac
fermions in interaction with a hermitean scalar eld, , and described by the ve dimensional
action

since the scalar eld is hermitean, it must obey untwisted boundary conditions. on the
other hand, twisted boundary conditions for the fermions

(x, y + 2r) = e2ia(x, y),

can be enforced via its fourier decomposition

as before, in the second equality the eight component zero mode fermion eld, (x)  0(x),
is singled out of the sum. if we now allow for the inclusion of higher dimensional operators
in the ve dimensional action such as

then their presence produces additional contributions to the four dimensional fermion masses
and yukawa coupling constants for the zero modes. explicitly, the mass squared becomes

here once again, these threshold eects of the higher dimensional operators may be sig-
nicant.

we conclude this note with an observation regarding the non-abelian global symmetry
breaking structure of the zero mode four dimensional eective action arising from the twisted
boundary conditions. the imposition of periodic boundary conditions up to a global sym-
metry transformation species a preferred direction in the symmetry group space and hence
breaks the global symmetry. noethers theorem relates the variation of the lagrangian, to
the divergence of the current as

()l = m j m ().

(14)

here i is the innitesimal global transformation parameter, with i enumerating the number
of parameters of the symmetry group, this in turn produces a variation of the action which
depends on the four dimensional integral of the dierence of the fourth component of the
current which arises from one complete circuit around the compact dimension so that

()i = z d4xhj m =4()|y=2r  j m =4()|y=0i .

(15)

for the case of a scalar eld transforming according to a representation t i of the symmetry
group, the twisted boundary conditions are of the form [3]

(x, y + 2r) = e2i~a ~t (x, y),

(16)

with ~a a particular direction in group space. satisfying this boundary condition leads to a
zero mode decomposition of the form

1

(x, y) =

2r
where  is the zero mode and u(y) = ei~a ~t y
r is a group element. for deniteness, consider
the model described by eq.(2) extended to allow for the non-abelian global symmetry. the
resultant action is

u(y)(x) + ...

note that this action contains an additional coupling relative to the u(1) example which
arises from the dierent ways the internal indices on the scalar elds can be contracted to
form a group singlet.

where the dijk arise through the anticommutator relation {t i, t j} = 2ij + dijkt k. as was
the case in the u(1) example, we have introduced the eective four dimensional coupling
constants via the same rescalings of their ve dimensional versions as in eq. (6) along with
the rescaling 3 = (5)

2r and have used that the kaluza-klein mass is m = 1/r.

substituting eq. (20) into eq. (15) yields the symmetry breaking boundary condition

where (tj)ik = ifijk are the adjoint representation matrices and (~a ~d)ij = akdikj. in obtaining
this result, the commutator relation [~a  ~d,~a  ~t] = 0 has been exploited.
as could have been anticipated there are breaking terms proportional to the kaluza-
klein mass squared, m 2. on the other hand, there are also breaking terms which are
dimension four operators which do not have an explicit m 2 coecient. these arise from
higher dimensional operators in the ve dimensional action in which derivatives act on the
compact dimension and once again reect the type of eect we discussed earlier in the paper.
an alternative, equivalent, method of securing eq. (21), is to rst directly compute the
zero mode four dimensional action by a reduction of the ve dimensional action, eq. (18).

once again, as a consequence of the twisted boundary conditions, certain higher dimensional
terms in the ve dimensional action which involve derivatives with respect to the compacti-
ed dimension become dimension four operators in this action. the explicit breaking terms
are those which contain the specic group direction ~a picked out by the boundary conditions.
the variation of this action can then be taken directly. one must be careful, however,
to note that the twisted boundary conditions built in to the modal expansion lead to a
transformation law for the zero mode elds which is boundary condition dependent and
somewhat non-canonical. specically, if the ve dimensional elds transform as

then the zero mode varies as

()(x, y) = i~  ~t (x, y),

()(x) = i~(a)  ~t (x) = ii


2i~a  ~t

t j(x),

(23)

(24)

which has the form of the usual symmetry transformation but with a boundary condition
dependent parameter. using this variation explicitly in eq. (22), one regains the transfor-
mation of the action as given in eq. (21).
